allergies, also, known, as, allergic, diseases, are, various, conditions, caused, by, hypersensitivity, of, the, immune, system, to, typically, harmless, substances, in, the, environment, these, diseases, include, hay, fever, food, allergies, atopic, dermatitis, allergic, asthma, and, anaphylaxis, symptoms, may, include, red, eyes, an, itchy, rash, sneezing, coughing, a, runny, nose, shortness, of, breath, or, swelling, note, that, food, intolerances, and, food, poisoning, are, separate, conditions, common, allergens, include, pollen, and, certain, foods, metals, and, other, substances, may, also, cause, such, problems, food, insect, stings, and, medications, are, common, causes, of, severe, reactions, their, development, is, due, to, both, genetic, and, environmental, factors, the, underlying, mechanism, involves, immunoglobulin, e, antibodies, ige, part, of, the, body, s, immune, system, binding, to, an, allergen, and, then, to, a, receptor, on, mast, cells, or, basophils, where, it, triggers, the, release, of, inflammatory, chemicals, such, as, histamine, diagnosis, is, typically, based, on, a, person, s, medical, history, further, testing, of, the, skin, or, blood, may, be, useful, in, certain, cases, positive, tests, however, may, not, necessarily, mean, there, is, a, significant, allergy, to, the, substance, in, question, early, exposure, of, children, to, potential, allergens, may, be, protective, treatments, for, allergies, include, avoidance, of, known, allergens, and, the, use, of, medications, such, as, steroids, and, antihistamines, in, severe, reactions, injectable, adrenaline, epinephrine, is, recommended, allergen, immunotherapy, which, gradually, exposes, people, to, larger, and, larger, amounts, of, allergen, is, useful, for, some, types, of, allergies, such, as, hay, fever, and, reactions, to, insect, bites, its, use, in, food, allergies, is, unclear, allergies, are, common, in, the, developed, world, about, 20, of, people, are, affected, by, allergic, rhinitis, about, 6, of, people, have, at, least, one, food, allergy, and, about, 20, have, or, have, had, atopic, dermatitis, at, some, point, in, time, depending, on, the, country, about, 1, 18, of, people, have, asthma, anaphylaxis, occurs, in, between, 0, 05, 2, of, people, rates, of, many, allergic, diseases, appear, to, be, increasing, the, word, allergy, was, first, used, by, clemens, von, pirquet, in, 1906, many, allergens, such, as, dust, or, pollen, are, airborne, particles, in, these, cases, symptoms, arise, in, areas, in, contact, with, air, such, as, the, eyes, nose, and, lungs, for, instance, allergic, rhinitis, also, known, as, hay, fever, causes, irritation, of, the, nose, sneezing, itching, and, redness, of, the, eyes, inhaled, allergens, can, also, lead, to, increased, production, of, mucus, in, the, lungs, shortness, of, breath, coughing, and, wheezing, aside, from, these, ambient, allergens, allergic, reactions, can, result, from, foods, insect, stings, and, reactions, to, medications, like, aspirin, and, antibiotics, such, as, penicillin, symptoms, of, food, allergy, include, abdominal, pain, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, itchy, skin, and, hives, food, allergies, rarely, cause, respiratory, asthmatic, reactions, or, rhinitis, insect, stings, food, antibiotics, and, certain, medicines, may, produce, a, systemic, allergic, response, that, is, also, called, anaphylaxis, multiple, organ, systems, can, be, affected, including, the, digestive, system, the, respiratory, system, and, the, circulatory, system, depending, on, the, severity, anaphylaxis, can, include, skin, reactions, bronchoconstriction, swelling, low, blood, pressure, coma, and, death, this, type, of, reaction, can, be, triggered, suddenly, or, the, onset, can, be, delayed, the, nature, of, anaphylaxis, is, such, that, the, reaction, can, seem, to, be, subsiding, but, may, recur, throughout, a, period, of, time, substances, that, come, into, contact, with, the, skin, such, as, latex, are, also, common, causes, of, allergic, reactions, known, as, contact, dermatitis, or, eczema, skin, allergies, frequently, cause, rashes, or, swelling, and, inflammation, within, the, skin, in, what, is, known, as, a, weal, and, flare, reaction, characteristic, of, hives, and, angioedema, with, insect, stings, a, large, local, reaction, may, occur, in, the, form, of, an, area, of, skin, redness, greater, than, 10, cm, in, size, that, can, last, one, to, two, days, this, reaction, may, also, occur, after, immunotherapy, risk, factors, for, allergies, can, be, placed, in, two, broad, categories, namely, host, and, environmental, factors, host, factors, include, heredity, sex, race, and, age, with, heredity, being, by, far, the, most, significant, however, there, has, been, a, recent, increase, in, the, incidence, of, allergic, disorders, that, cannot, be, explained, by, genetic, factors, alone, four, major, environmental, candidates, are, alterations, in, exposure, to, infectious, diseases, during, early, childhood, environmental, pollution, allergen, levels, and, dietary, changes, dust, mite, allergy, also, known, as, house, dust, allergy, is, a, sensitization, and, allergic, reaction, to, the, droppings, of, house, dust, mites, the, allergy, is, common, and, can, trigger, allergic, reactions, such, as, asthma, eczema, or, itching, it, is, the, manifestation, of, parasitosis, the, mite, s, gut, contains, potent, digestive, enzymes, notably, peptidase, 1, that, persist, in, their, feces, and, are, major, inducers, of, allergic, reactions, such, as, wheezing, the, mite, s, exoskeleton, can, also, contribute, to, allergic, reactions, unlike, scabies, mites, or, skin, follicle, mites, house, dust, mites, do, not, burrow, under, the, skin, and, are, not, parasitic, a, wide, variety, of, foods, can, cause, allergic, reactions, but, 90, of, allergic, responses, to, foods, are, caused, by, cow, s, milk, soy, eggs, wheat, peanuts, tree, nuts, fish, and, shellfish, other, food, allergies, affecting, less, than, 1, person, per, 10, 000, population, may, be, considered, rare, the, most, common, food, allergy, in, the, us, population, is, a, sensitivity, to, crustacea, although, peanut, allergies, are, notorious, for, their, severity, peanut, allergies, are, not, the, most, common, food, allergy, in, adults, or, children, severe, or, life, threatening, reactions, may, be, triggered, by, other, allergens, and, are, more, common, when, combined, with, asthma, rates, of, allergies, differ, between, adults, and, children, children, can, sometimes, outgrow, peanut, allergies, egg, allergies, affect, one, to, two, percent, of, children, but, are, outgrown, by, about, two, thirds, of, children, by, the, age, of, 5, the, sensitivity, is, usually, to, proteins, in, the, white, rather, than, the, yolk, milk, protein, allergies, distinct, from, lactose, intolerance, are, most, common, in, children, approximately, 60, of, milk, protein, reactions, are, immunoglobulin, e, mediated, with, the, remaining, usually, attributable, to, inflammation, of, the, colon, some, people, are, unable, to, tolerate, milk, from, goats, or, sheep, as, well, as, from, cows, and, many, are, also, unable, to, tolerate, dairy, products, such, as, cheese, roughly, 10, of, children, with, a, milk, allergy, will, have, a, reaction, to, beef, lactose, intolerance, a, common, reaction, to, milk, is, not, a, form, of, allergy, at, all, but, due, to, the, absence, of, an, enzyme, in, the, digestive, tract, those, with, tree, nut, allergies, may, be, allergic, to, one, or, to, many, tree, nuts, including, pecans, pistachios, pine, nuts, and, walnuts, in, addition, seeds, including, sesame, seeds, and, poppy, seeds, contain, oils, in, which, protein, is, present, which, may, elicit, an, allergic, reaction, allergens, can, be, transferred, from, one, food, to, another, through, genetic, engineering, however, genetic, modification, can, also, remove, allergens, little, research, has, been, done, on, the, natural, variation, of, allergen, concentrations, in, unmodified, crops, latex, can, trigger, an, ige, mediated, cutaneous, respiratory, and, systemic, reaction, the, prevalence, of, latex, allergy, in, the, general, population, is, believed, to, be, less, than, one, percent, in, a, hospital, study, 1, in, 800, surgical, patients, 0, 125, percent, reported, latex, sensitivity, although, the, sensitivity, among, healthcare, workers, is, higher, between, seven, and, ten, percent, researchers, attribute, this, higher, level, to, the, exposure, of, healthcare, workers, to, areas, with, significant, airborne, latex, allergens, such, as, operating, rooms, intensive, care, units, and, dental, suites, these, latex, rich, environments, may, sensitize, healthcare, workers, who, regularly, inhale, allergenic, proteins, the, most, prevalent, response, to, latex, is, an, allergic, contact, dermatitis, a, delayed, hypersensitive, reaction, appearing, as, dry, crusted, lesions, this, reaction, usually, lasts, 48, 96, hours, sweating, or, rubbing, the, area, under, the, glove, aggravates, the, lesions, possibly, leading, to, ulcerations, anaphylactic, reactions, occur, most, often, in, sensitive, patients, who, have, been, exposed, to, a, surgeon, s, latex, gloves, during, abdominal, surgery, but, other, mucosal, exposures, such, as, dental, procedures, can, also, produce, systemic, reactions, latex, and, banana, sensitivity, may, cross, react, furthermore, those, with, latex, allergy, may, also, have, sensitivities, to, avocado, kiwifruit, and, chestnut, these, people, often, have, perioral, itching, and, local, urticaria, only, occasionally, have, these, food, induced, allergies, induced, systemic, responses, researchers, suspect, that, the, cross, reactivity, of, latex, with, banana, avocado, kiwifruit, and, chestnut, occurs, because, latex, proteins, are, structurally, homologous, with, some, other, plant, proteins, about, 10, of, people, report, that, they, are, allergic, to, penicillin, however, of, that, 10, 90, turn, out, not, to, be, serious, allergies, only, occur, in, about, 0, 03, one, of, the, main, sources, of, human, allergies, is, insects, an, allergy, to, insects, can, be, brought, on, by, bites, stings, ingestion, and, inhalation, another, non, food, protein, reaction, urushiol, induced, contact, dermatitis, originates, after, contact, with, poison, ivy, eastern, poison, oak, western, poison, oak, or, poison, sumac, urushiol, which, is, not, itself, a, protein, acts, as, a, hapten, and, chemically, reacts, with, binds, to, and, changes, the, shape, of, integral, membrane, proteins, on, exposed, skin, cells, the, immune, system, does, not, recognize, the, affected, cells, as, normal, parts, of, the, body, causing, a, t, cell, mediated, immune, response, of, these, poisonous, plants, sumac, is, the, most, virulent, the, resulting, dermatological, response, to, the, reaction, between, urushiol, and, membrane, proteins, includes, redness, swelling, papules, vesicles, blisters, and, streaking, estimates, vary, on, the, population, fraction, that, will, have, an, immune, system, response, approximately, 25, of, the, population, will, have, a, strong, allergic, response, to, urushiol, in, general, approximately, 80, 90, of, adults, will, develop, a, rash, if, they, are, exposed, to, 0, 0050, mg, 7, 7, 10, 5, gr, of, purified, urushiol, but, some, people, are, so, sensitive, that, it, takes, only, a, molecular, trace, on, the, skin, to, initiate, an, allergic, reaction, allergic, diseases, are, strongly, familial, identical, twins, are, likely, to, have, the, same, allergic, diseases, about, 70, of, the, time, the, same, allergy, occurs, about, 40, of, the, time, in, non, identical, twins, allergic, parents, are, more, likely, to, have, allergic, children, and, those, children, s, allergies, are, likely, to, be, more, severe, than, those, in, children, of, non, allergic, parents, some, allergies, however, are, not, consistent, along, genealogies, parents, who, are, allergic, to, peanuts, may, have, children, who, are, allergic, to, ragweed, the, likelihood, of, developing, allergies, is, inherited, and, related, to, an, irregularity, in, the, immune, system, but, the, specific, allergen, is, not, the, risk, of, allergic, sensitization, and, the, development, of, allergies, varies, with, age, with, young, children, most, at, risk, several, studies, have, shown, that, ige, levels, are, highest, in, childhood, and, fall, rapidly, between, the, ages, of, 10, and, 30, years, the, peak, prevalence, of, hay, fever, is, highest, in, children, and, young, adults, and, the, incidence, of, asthma, is, highest, in, children, under, 10, ethnicity, may, play, a, role, in, some, allergies, however, racial, factors, have, been, difficult, to, separate, from, environmental, influences, and, changes, due, to, migration, it, has, been, suggested, that, different, genetic, loci, are, responsible, for, asthma, to, be, specific, in, people, of, european, hispanic, asian, and, african, origins, allergic, diseases, are, caused, by, inappropriate, immunological, responses, to, harmless, antigens, driven, by, a, th2, mediated, immune, response, many, bacteria, and, viruses, elicit, a, th1, mediated, immune, response, which, down, regulates, th2, responses, the, first, proposed, mechanism, of, action, of, the, hygiene, hypothesis, was, that, insufficient, stimulation, of, the, th1, arm, of, the, immune, system, leads, to, an, overactive, th2, arm, which, in, turn, leads, to, allergic, disease, in, other, words, individuals, living, in, too, sterile, an, environment, are, not, exposed, to, enough, pathogens, to, keep, the, immune, system, busy, since, our, bodies, evolved, to, deal, with, a, certain, level, of, such, pathogens, when, they, are, not, exposed, to, this, level, the, immune, system, will, attack, harmless, antigens, and, thus, normally, benign, microbial, objects, like, pollen, will, trigger, an, immune, response, the, hygiene, hypothesis, was, developed, to, explain, the, observation, that, hay, fever, and, eczema, both, allergic, diseases, were, less, common, in, children, from, larger, families, which, were, it, is, presumed, exposed, to, more, infectious, agents, through, their, siblings, than, in, children, from, families, with, only, one, child, it, is, used, to, explain, the, increase, in, allergic, diseases, that, have, been, seen, since, industrialization, and, the, higher, incidence, of, allergic, diseases, in, more, developed, countries, the, hygiene, hypothesis, has, now, expanded, to, include, exposure, to, symbiotic, bacteria, and, parasites, as, important, modulators, of, immune, system, development, along, with, infectious, agents, epidemiological, data, support, the, hygiene, hypothesis, studies, have, shown, that, various, immunological, and, autoimmune, diseases, are, much, less, common, in, the, developing, world, than, the, industrialized, world, and, that, immigrants, to, the, industrialized, world, from, the, developing, world, increasingly, develop, immunological, disorders, in, relation, to, the, length, of, time, since, arrival, in, the, industrialized, world, longitudinal, studies, in, the, third, world, demonstrate, an, increase, in, immunological, disorders, as, a, country, grows, more, affluent, and, it, is, presumed, cleaner, the, use, of, antibiotics, in, the, first, year, of, life, has, been, linked, to, asthma, and, other, allergic, diseases, the, use, of, antibacterial, cleaning, products, has, also, been, associated, with, higher, incidence, of, asthma, as, has, birth, by, caesarean, section, rather, than, vaginal, birth, chronic, stress, can, aggravate, allergic, conditions, this, has, been, attributed, to, a, t, helper, 2, th2, predominant, response, driven, by, suppression, of, interleukin, 12, by, both, the, autonomic, nervous, system, and, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, stress, management, in, highly, susceptible, individuals, may, improve, symptoms, allergic, diseases, are, more, common, in, industrialized, countries, than, in, countries, that, are, more, traditional, or, agricultural, and, there, is, a, higher, rate, of, allergic, disease, in, urban, populations, versus, rural, populations, although, these, differences, are, becoming, less, defined, historically, the, trees, planted, in, urban, areas, were, predominantly, male, to, prevent, litter, from, seeds, and, fruits, but, the, high, ratio, of, male, trees, causes, high, pollen, counts, a, phenomenon, that, horticulturist, tom, ogren, has, called, botanical, sexism, alterations, in, exposure, to, microorganisms, is, another, plausible, explanation, at, present, for, the, increase, in, atopic, allergy, endotoxin, exposure, reduces, release, of, inflammatory, cytokines, such, as, tnf, ifn, interleukin, 10, and, interleukin, 12, from, white, blood, cells, leukocytes, that, circulate, in, the, blood, certain, microbe, sensing, proteins, known, as, toll, like, receptors, found, on, the, surface, of, cells, in, the, body, are, also, thought, to, be, involved, in, these, processes, parasitic, worms, and, similar, parasites, are, present, in, untreated, drinking, water, in, developing, countries, and, were, present, in, the, water, of, developed, countries, until, the, routine, chlorination, and, purification, of, drinking, water, supplies, recent, research, has, shown, that, some, common, parasites, such, as, intestinal, worms, e, g, hookworms, secrete, chemicals, into, the, gut, wall, and, hence, the, bloodstream, that, suppress, the, immune, system, and, prevent, the, body, from, attacking, the, parasite, this, gives, rise, to, a, new, slant, on, the, hygiene, hypothesis, theory, that, co, evolution, of, humans, and, parasites, has, led, to, an, immune, system, that, functions, correctly, only, in, the, presence, of, the, parasites, without, them, the, immune, system, becomes, unbalanced, and, oversensitive, in, particular, research, suggests, that, allergies, may, coincide, with, the, delayed, establishment, of, gut, flora, in, infants, however, the, research, to, support, this, theory, is, conflicting, with, some, studies, performed, in, china, and, ethiopia, showing, an, increase, in, allergy, in, people, infected, with, intestinal, worms, clinical, trials, have, been, initiated, to, test, the, effectiveness, of, certain, worms, in, treating, some, allergies, it, may, be, that, the, term, parasite, could, turn, out, to, be, inappropriate, and, in, fact, a, hitherto, unsuspected, symbiosis, is, at, work, for, more, information, on, this, topic, see, helminthic, therapy, in, the, initial, stages, of, allergy, a, type, i, hypersensitivity, reaction, against, an, allergen, encountered, for, the, first, time, and, presented, by, a, professional, antigen, presenting, cell, causes, a, response, in, a, type, of, immune, cell, called, a, t, h, 2, lymphocyte, a, subset, of, t, cells, that, produce, a, cytokine, called, interleukin, 4, il, 4, these, t, h, 2, cells, interact, with, other, lymphocytes, called, b, cells, whose, role, is, production, of, antibodies, coupled, with, signals, provided, by, il, 4, this, interaction, stimulates, the, b, cell, to, begin, production, of, a, large, amount, of, a, particular, type, of, antibody, known, as, ige, secreted, ige, circulates, in, the, blood, and, binds, to, an, ige, specific, receptor, a, kind, of, fc, receptor, called, fc, ri, on, the, surface, of, other, kinds, of, immune, cells, called, mast, cells, and, basophils, which, are, both, involved, in, the, acute, inflammatory, response, the, ige, coated, cells, at, this, stage, are, sensitized, to, the, allergen, if, later, exposure, to, the, same, allergen, occurs, the, allergen, can, bind, to, the, ige, molecules, held, on, the, surface, of, the, mast, cells, or, basophils, cross, linking, of, the, ige, and, fc, receptors, occurs, when, more, than, one, ige, receptor, complex, interacts, with, the, same, allergenic, molecule, and, activates, the, sensitized, cell, activated, mast, cells, and, basophils, undergo, a, process, called, degranulation, during, which, they, release, histamine, and, other, inflammatory, chemical, mediators, cytokines, interleukins, leukotrienes, and, prostaglandins, from, their, granules, into, the, surrounding, tissue, causing, several, systemic, effects, such, as, vasodilation, mucous, secretion, nerve, stimulation, and, smooth, muscle, contraction, this, results, in, rhinorrhea, itchiness, dyspnea, and, anaphylaxis, depending, on, the, individual, allergen, and, mode, of, introduction, the, symptoms, can, be, system, wide, classical, anaphylaxis, or, localized, to, specific, body, systems, asthma, is, localized, to, the, respiratory, system, and, eczema, is, localized, to, the, dermis, after, the, chemical, mediators, of, the, acute, response, subside, late, phase, responses, can, often, occur, this, is, due, to, the, migration, of, other, leukocytes, such, as, neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and, macrophages, to, the, initial, site, the, reaction, is, usually, seen, 2, 24, hours, after, the, original, reaction, cytokines, from, mast, cells, may, play, a, role, in, the, persistence, of, long, term, effects, late, phase, responses, seen, in, asthma, are, slightly, different, from, those, seen, in, other, allergic, responses, although, they, are, still, caused, by, release, of, mediators, from, eosinophils, and, are, still, dependent, on, activity, of, t, h, 2, cells, although, allergic, contact, dermatitis, is, termed, an, allergic, reaction, which, usually, refers, to, type, i, hypersensitivity, its, pathophysiology, involves, a, reaction, that, more, correctly, corresponds, to, a, type, iv, hypersensitivity, reaction, in, type, iv, hypersensitivity, there, is, activation, of, certain, types, of, t, cells, cd8, that, destroy, target, cells, on, contact, as, well, as, activated, macrophages, that, produce, hydrolytic, enzymes, effective, management, of, allergic, diseases, relies, on, the, ability, to, make, an, accurate, diagnosis, allergy, testing, can, help, confirm, or, rule, out, allergies, correct, diagnosis, counseling, and, avoidance, advice, based, on, valid, allergy, test, results, reduce, the, incidence, of, symptoms, and, need, for, medications, and, improve, quality, of, life, to, assess, the, presence, of, allergen, specific, ige, antibodies, two, different, methods, can, be, used, a, skin, prick, test, or, an, allergy, blood, test, both, methods, are, recommended, and, they, have, similar, diagnostic, value, skin, prick, tests, and, blood, tests, are, equally, cost, effective, and, health, economic, evidence, shows, that, both, tests, were, cost, effective, compared, with, no, test, early, and, more, accurate, diagnoses, save, cost, due, to, reduced, consultations, referrals, to, secondary, care, misdiagnosis, and, emergency, admissions, allergy, undergoes, dynamic, changes, over, time, regular, allergy, testing, of, relevant, allergens, provides, information, on, if, and, how, patient, management, can, be, changed, to, improve, health, and, quality, of, life, annual, testing, is, often, the, practice, for, determining, whether, allergy, to, milk, egg, soy, and, wheat, have, been, outgrown, and, the, testing, interval, is, extended, to, 2, 3, years, for, allergy, to, peanut, tree, nuts, fish, and, crustacean, shellfish, results, of, follow, up, testing, can, guide, decision, making, regarding, whether, and, when, it, is, safe, to, introduce, or, re, introduce, allergenic, food, into, the, diet, skin, testing, is, also, known, as, puncture, testing, and, prick, testing, due, to, the, series, of, tiny, punctures, or, pricks, made, into, the, patient, s, skin, tiny, amounts, of, suspected, allergens, and, or, their, extracts, e, g, pollen, grass, mite, proteins, peanut, extract, are, introduced, to, sites, on, the, skin, marked, with, pen, or, dye, the, ink, dye, should, be, carefully, selected, lest, it, cause, an, allergic, response, itself, a, negative, and, positive, control, are, also, included, for, comparison, eg, negative, is, saline, or, glycerin, positive, is, histamine, a, small, plastic, or, metal, device, is, used, to, puncture, or, prick, the, skin, sometimes, the, allergens, are, injected, intradermally, into, the, patient, s, skin, with, a, needle, and, syringe, common, areas, for, testing, include, the, inside, forearm, and, the, back, if, the, patient, is, allergic, to, the, substance, then, a, visible, inflammatory, reaction, will, usually, occur, within, 30, minutes, this, response, will, range, from, slight, reddening, of, the, skin, to, a, full, blown, hive, called, wheal, and, flare, in, more, sensitive, patients, similar, to, a, mosquito, bite, interpretation, of, the, results, of, the, skin, prick, test, is, normally, done, by, allergists, on, a, scale, of, severity, with, meaning, borderline, reactivity, and, 4, being, a, large, reaction, increasingly, allergists, are, measuring, and, recording, the, diameter, of, the, wheal, and, flare, reaction, interpretation, by, well, trained, allergists, is, often, guided, by, relevant, literature, in, general, a, positive, response, is, interpreted, when, the, wheal, of, an, antigen, is, 3mm, larger, than, the, wheal, of, the, negative, control, eg, saline, or, glycerin, some, patients, may, believe, they, have, determined, their, own, allergic, sensitivity, from, observation, but, a, skin, test, has, been, shown, to, be, much, better, than, patient, observation, to, detect, allergy, if, a, serious, life, threatening, anaphylactic, reaction, has, brought, a, patient, in, for, evaluation, some, allergists, will, prefer, an, initial, blood, test, prior, to, performing, the, skin, prick, test, skin, tests, may, not, be, an, option, if, the, patient, has, widespread, skin, disease, or, has, taken, antihistamines, in, the, last, several, days, patch, testing, is, a, method, used, to, determine, if, a, specific, substance, causes, allergic, inflammation, of, the, skin, it, tests, for, delayed, reactions, it, is, used, to, help, ascertain, the, cause, of, skin, contact, allergy, or, contact, dermatitis, adhesive, patches, usually, treated, with, several, common, allergic, chemicals, or, skin, sensitizers, are, applied, to, the, back, the, skin, is, then, examined, for, possible, local, reactions, at, least, twice, usually, at, 48, hours, after, application, of, the, patch, and, again, two, or, three, days, later, an, allergy, blood, test, is, quick, and, simple, and, can, be, ordered, by, a, licensed, health, care, provider, e, g, an, allergy, specialist, or, general, practitioner, unlike, skin, prick, testing, a, blood, test, can, be, performed, irrespective, of, age, skin, condition, medication, symptom, disease, activity, and, pregnancy, adults, and, children, of, any, age, can, get, an, allergy, blood, test, for, babies, and, very, young, children, a, single, needle, stick, for, allergy, blood, testing, is, often, gentler, than, several, skin, pricks, an, allergy, blood, test, is, available, through, most, laboratories, a, sample, of, the, patient, s, blood, is, sent, to, a, laboratory, for, analysis, and, the, results, are, sent, back, a, few, days, later, multiple, allergens, can, be, detected, with, a, single, blood, sample, allergy, blood, tests, are, very, safe, since, the, person, is, not, exposed, to, any, allergens, during, the, testing, procedure, the, test, measures, the, concentration, of, specific, ige, antibodies, in, the, blood, quantitative, ige, test, results, increase, the, possibility, of, ranking, how, different, substances, may, affect, symptoms, a, rule, of, thumb, is, that, the, higher, the, ige, antibody, value, the, greater, the, likelihood, of, symptoms, allergens, found, at, low, levels, that, today, do, not, result, in, symptoms, cannot, help, predict, future, symptom, development, the, quantitative, allergy, blood, result, can, help, determine, what, a, patient, is, allergic, to, help, predict, and, follow, the, disease, development, estimate, the, risk, of, a, severe, reaction, and, explain, cross, reactivity, a, low, total, ige, level, is, not, adequate, to, rule, out, sensitization, to, commonly, inhaled, allergens, statistical, methods, such, as, roc, curves, predictive, value, calculations, and, likelihood, ratios, have, been, used, to, examine, the, relationship, of, various, testing, methods, to, each, other, these, methods, have, shown, that, patients, with, a, high, total, ige, have, a, high, probability, of, allergic, sensitization, but, further, investigation, with, allergy, tests, for, specific, ige, antibodies, for, a, carefully, chosen, of, allergens, is, often, warranted, laboratory, methods, to, measure, specific, ige, antibodies, for, allergy, testing, include, enzyme, linked, immunosorbent, assay, elisa, or, eia, radioallergosorbent, test, rast, fluorescent, enzyme, immunoassay, feia, and, chemiluminescence, immunoassay, clia, challenge, testing, challenge, testing, is, when, tiny, amounts, of, a, suspected, allergen, are, introduced, to, the, body, orally, through, inhalation, or, via, other, routes, except, for, testing, food, and, medication, allergies, challenges, are, rarely, performed, when, this, type, of, testing, is, chosen, it, must, be, closely, supervised, by, an, allergist, elimination, challenge, tests, this, testing, method, is, used, most, often, with, foods, or, medicines, a, patient, with, a, suspected, allergen, is, instructed, to, modify, his, diet, to, totally, avoid, that, allergen, for, a, set, time, if, the, patient, experiences, significant, improvement, he, may, then, be, challenged, by, reintroducing, the, allergen, to, see, if, symptoms, are, reproduced, unreliable, tests, there, are, other, types, of, allergy, testing, methods, that, are, unreliable, including, applied, kinesiology, allergy, testing, through, muscle, relaxation, cytotoxicity, testing, urine, autoinjection, skin, titration, rinkel, method, and, provocative, and, neutralization, subcutaneous, testing, or, sublingual, provocation, before, a, diagnosis, of, allergic, disease, can, be, confirmed, other, plausible, causes, of, the, presenting, symptoms, must, be, considered, vasomotor, rhinitis, for, example, is, one, of, many, illnesses, that, share, symptoms, with, allergic, rhinitis, underscoring, the, need, for, professional, differential, diagnosis, once, a, diagnosis, of, asthma, rhinitis, anaphylaxis, or, other, allergic, disease, has, been, made, there, are, several, methods, for, discovering, the, causative, agent, of, that, allergy, giving, peanut, products, early, may, decrease, the, risk, of, allergies, while, only, breastfeeding, during, at, least, the, first, few, months, of, life, may, decrease, the, risk, of, dermatitis, there, is, no, good, evidence, that, a, mother, s, diet, during, pregnancy, or, breastfeeding, affects, the, risk, of, allergies, nor, is, there, evidence, that, delayed, introduction, of, certain, foods, is, useful, early, exposure, to, potential, allergens, may, actually, be, protective, fish, oil, supplementation, during, pregnancy, is, associated, with, a, lower, risk, probiotic, supplements, during, pregnancy, or, infancy, may, help, to, prevent, atopic, dermatitis, management, of, allergies, typically, involves, avoiding, the, allergy, trigger, and, taking, medications, to, improve, the, symptoms, allergen, immunotherapy, may, be, useful, for, some, types, of, allergies, several, medications, may, be, used, to, block, the, action, of, allergic, mediators, or, to, prevent, activation, of, cells, and, degranulation, processes, these, include, antihistamines, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, adrenaline, mast, cell, stabilizers, and, antileukotriene, agents, are, common, treatments, of, allergic, diseases, anticholinergics, decongestants, and, other, compounds, thought, to, impair, eosinophil, chemotaxis, are, also, commonly, used, although, rare, the, severity, of, anaphylaxis, often, requires, epinephrine, injection, and, where, medical, care, is, unavailable, a, device, known, as, an, epinephrine, autoinjector, may, be, used, allergen, immunotherapy, is, useful, for, environmental, allergies, allergies, to, insect, bites, and, asthma, its, benefit, for, food, allergies, is, unclear, and, thus, not, recommended, immunotherapy, involves, exposing, people, to, larger, and, larger, amounts, of, allergen, in, an, effort, to, change, the, immune, system, s, response, meta, analyses, have, found, that, injections, of, allergens, under, the, skin, is, effective, in, the, treatment, in, allergic, rhinitis, in, children, and, in, asthma, the, benefits, may, last, for, years, after, treatment, is, stopped, it, is, generally, safe, and, effective, for, allergic, rhinitis, and, conjunctivitis, allergic, forms, of, asthma, and, stinging, insects, to, a, lesser, extent, the, evidence, also, supports, the, use, of, sublingual, immunotherapy, for, rhinitis, and, asthma, for, seasonal, allergies, the, benefit, is, small, in, this, form, the, allergen, is, given, under, the, tongue, and, people, often, prefer, it, to, injections, immunotherapy, is, not, recommended, as, a, stand, alone, treatment, for, asthma, an, experimental, treatment, enzyme, potentiated, desensitization, epd, has, been, tried, for, decades, but, is, not, generally, accepted, as, effective, epd, uses, dilutions, of, allergen, and, an, enzyme, beta, glucuronidase, to, which, t, regulatory, lymphocytes, are, supposed, to, respond, by, favoring, desensitization, or, down, regulation, rather, than, sensitization, epd, has, also, been, tried, for, the, treatment, of, autoimmune, diseases, but, evidence, does, not, show, effectiveness, a, review, found, no, effectiveness, of, homeopathic, treatments, and, no, difference, compared, with, placebo, the, authors, concluded, that, based, on, rigorous, clinical, trials, of, all, types, of, homeopathy, for, childhood, and, adolescence, ailments, there, is, no, convincing, evidence, that, supports, the, use, of, homeopathic, treatments, according, to, the, national, center, for, complementary, and, integrative, health, u, s, the, evidence, is, relatively, strong, that, saline, nasal, irrigation, and, butterbur, are, effective, when, compared, to, other, alternative, medicine, treatments, for, which, the, scientific, evidence, is, weak, negative, or, nonexistent, such, as, honey, acupuncture, omega, 3, s, probiotics, astragalus, capsaicin, grape, seed, extract, pycnogenol, quercetin, spirulina, stinging, nettle, tinospora, or, guduchi, the, allergic, diseases, hay, fever, and, asthma, have, increased, in, the, western, world, over, the, past, 2, 3, decades, increases, in, allergic, asthma, and, other, atopic, disorders, in, industrialized, nations, it, is, estimated, began, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, with, further, increases, occurring, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, although, some, suggest, that, a, steady, rise, in, sensitization, has, been, occurring, since, the, 1920s, the, number, of, new, cases, per, year, of, atopy, in, developing, countries, has, in, general, remained, much, lower, although, genetic, factors, govern, susceptibility, to, atopic, disease, increases, in, atopy, have, occurred, within, too, short, a, period, to, be, explained, by, a, genetic, change, in, the, population, thus, pointing, to, environmental, or, lifestyle, changes, several, hypotheses, have, been, identified, to, explain, this, increased, rate, increased, exposure, to, perennial, allergens, may, be, due, to, housing, changes, and, increased, time, spent, indoors, and, a, decreased, activation, of, a, common, immune, control, mechanism, may, be, caused, by, changes, in, cleanliness, or, hygiene, and, exacerbated, by, dietary, changes, obesity, and, decline, in, physical, exercise, the, hygiene, hypothesis, maintains, that, high, living, standards, and, hygienic, conditions, exposes, children, to, fewer, infections, it, is, thought, that, reduced, bacterial, and, viral, infections, early, in, life, direct, the, maturing, immune, system, away, from, t, h, 1, type, responses, leading, to, unrestrained, t, h, 2, responses, that, allow, for, an, increase, in, allergy, changes, in, rates, and, types, of, infection, alone, however, have, been, unable, to, explain, the, observed, increase, in, allergic, disease, and, recent, evidence, has, focused, attention, on, the, importance, of, the, gastrointestinal, microbial, environment, evidence, has, shown, that, exposure, to, food, and, fecal, oral, pathogens, such, as, hepatitis, a, toxoplasma, gondii, and, helicobacter, pylori, which, also, tend, to, be, more, prevalent, in, developing, countries, can, reduce, the, overall, risk, of, atopy, by, more, than, 60, and, an, increased, rate, of, parasitic, infections, has, been, associated, with, a, decreased, prevalence, of, asthma, it, is, speculated, that, these, infections, exert, their, effect, by, critically, altering, t, h, 1, t, h, 2, regulation, important, elements, of, newer, hygiene, hypotheses, also, include, exposure, to, endotoxins, exposure, to, pets, and, growing, up, on, a, farm, some, symptoms, attributable, to, allergic, diseases, are, mentioned, in, ancient, sources, particularly, three, members, of, the, roman, julio, claudian, dynasty, augustus, claudius, and, britannicus, are, suspected, to, have, a, family, history, of, atopy, the, concept, of, allergy, was, originally, introduced, in, 1906, by, the, viennese, pediatrician, clemens, von, pirquet, after, he, noticed, that, patients, who, had, received, injections, of, horse, serum, or, smallpox, vaccine, usually, had, quicker, more, severe, reactions, to, second, injections, pirquet, called, this, phenomenon, allergy, from, the, ancient, greek, words, allos, meaning, other, and, ergon, meaning, work, all, forms, of, hypersensitivity, used, to, be, classified, as, allergies, and, all, were, thought, to, be, caused, by, an, improper, activation, of, the, immune, system, later, it, became, clear, that, several, different, disease, mechanisms, were, implicated, with, a, common, link, to, a, disordered, activation, of, the, immune, system, in, 1963, a, new, classification, scheme, was, designed, by, philip, gell, and, robin, coombs, that, described, four, types, of, hypersensitivity, reactions, known, as, type, i, to, type, iv, hypersensitivity, with, this, new, classification, the, word, allergy, sometimes, clarified, as, a, true, allergy, was, restricted, to, type, i, hypersensitivities, also, called, immediate, hypersensitivity, which, are, characterized, as, rapidly, developing, reactions, involving, ige, antibodies, a, major, breakthrough, in, understanding, the, mechanisms, of, allergy, was, the, discovery, of, the, antibody, class, labeled, immunoglobulin, e, ige, ige, was, simultaneously, discovered, in, 1966, 67, by, two, independent, groups, ishizaka, s, team, at, the, children, s, asthma, research, institute, and, hospital, in, denver, usa, and, by, gunnar, johansson, and, hans, bennich, in, uppsala, sweden, their, joint, paper, was, published, in, april, 1969, radiometric, assays, include, the, radioallergosorbent, test, rast, test, method, which, uses, ige, binding, anti, ige, antibodies, labeled, with, radioactive, isotopes, for, quantifying, the, levels, of, ige, antibody, in, the, blood, the, rast, methodology, was, invented, and, marketed, in, 1974, by, pharmacia, diagnostics, ab, uppsala, sweden, and, the, acronym, rast, is, actually, a, brand, name, in, 1989, pharmacia, diagnostics, ab, replaced, it, with, a, superior, test, named, the, immunocap, specific, ige, blood, test, which, uses, the, newer, fluorescence, labeled, technology, american, college, of, allergy, asthma, and, immunology, acaai, and, the, american, academy, of, allergy, asthma, and, immunology, aaaai, issued, the, joint, task, force, report, pearls, and, pitfalls, of, allergy, diagnostic, testing, in, 2008, and, is, firm, in, its, statement, that, the, term, rast, is, now, obsolete, the, term, rast, became, a, colloquialism, for, all, varieties, of, in, vitro, allergy, tests, this, is, unfortunate, because, it, is, well, recognized, that, there, are, well, performing, tests, and, some, that, do, not, perform, so, well, yet, they, are, all, called, rasts, making, it, difficult, to, distinguish, which, is, which, for, these, reasons, it, is, now, recommended, that, use, of, rast, as, a, generic, descriptor, of, these, tests, be, abandoned, the, updated, version, the, immunocap, specific, ige, blood, test, is, the, only, specific, ige, assay, to, receive, food, and, drug, administration, approval, to, quantitatively, report, to, its, detection, limit,
