cardiology, from, ancient, greek, kardi, heart, and, logia, study, is, the, study, of, the, heart, cardiology, is, a, branch, of, medicine, that, deals, with, disorders, of, the, heart, and, the, cardiovascular, system, the, field, includes, medical, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, congenital, heart, defects, coronary, artery, disease, heart, failure, valvular, heart, disease, and, electrophysiology, physicians, who, specialize, in, this, field, of, medicine, are, called, cardiologists, a, sub, specialty, of, internal, medicine, pediatric, cardiologists, are, pediatricians, who, specialize, in, cardiology, physicians, who, specialize, in, cardiac, surgery, are, called, cardiothoracic, surgeons, or, cardiac, surgeons, a, specialty, of, general, surgery, all, cardiologists, in, the, branch, of, medicine, study, the, disorders, of, the, heart, but, the, study, of, adult, and, child, heart, disorders, each, require, different, training, pathways, therefore, an, adult, cardiologist, often, simply, called, cardiologist, is, inadequately, trained, to, take, care, of, children, and, pediatric, cardiologists, are, not, trained, to, treat, adult, heart, disease, surgical, aspects, outside, of, cardiac, rhythm, device, implant, are, not, included, in, cardiology, and, are, in, the, domain, of, cardiothoracic, surgery, for, example, coronary, artery, bypass, surgery, cabg, cardiopulmonary, bypass, and, valve, replacement, are, surgical, procedures, performed, by, surgeons, not, cardiologists, typically, a, cardiologist, would, first, identify, who, is, in, need, of, cardiac, surgery, and, refer, them, to, a, cardiac, surgeon, for, the, procedure, however, some, invasive, procedures, such, as, cardiac, catheterization, and, pacemaker, implantation, are, performed, by, cardiologists, cardiology, is, a, specialty, of, internal, medicine, to, become, a, cardiologist, in, the, united, states, a, three, year, residency, in, internal, medicine, is, followed, by, a, three, year, fellowship, in, cardiology, it, is, possible, to, specialize, further, in, a, sub, specialty, recognized, sub, specialties, in, the, u, s, by, the, accreditation, council, for, graduate, medical, education, are, clinical, cardiac, electrophysiology, interventional, cardiology, adult, congenital, heart, disease, and, advanced, heart, failure, and, transplant, cardiology, cardiologists, may, further, become, certified, in, echocardiography, by, the, national, board, of, echocardiography, in, nuclear, cardiology, by, the, certification, board, of, nuclear, cardiology, in, cardiovascular, computed, tomography, by, the, certification, board, of, cardiovascular, computed, tomography, in, cardiovascular, mri, by, the, certification, board, of, cardiovascular, magnetic, resonance, recognized, subspecialties, in, the, u, s, by, the, american, osteopathic, association, bureau, of, osteopathic, specialists, include, clinical, cardiac, electrophysiology, and, interventional, cardiology, in, india, a, three, year, residency, in, general, medicine, or, pediatrics, after, m, b, b, s, and, then, three, years, of, residency, in, cardiology, are, needed, to, be, a, d, m, holder, of, a, doctorate, of, medicine, diplomate, of, national, board, dnb, in, cardiology, per, doximity, adult, cardiologists, earn, an, average, of, 436, 849, per, year, in, the, u, s, cardiac, electrophysiology, is, the, science, of, elucidating, diagnosing, and, treating, the, electrical, activities, of, the, heart, the, term, is, usually, used, to, describe, studies, of, such, phenomena, by, invasive, intracardiac, catheter, recording, of, spontaneous, activity, as, well, as, of, cardiac, responses, to, programmed, electrical, stimulation, pes, these, studies, are, performed, to, assess, complex, arrhythmias, elucidate, symptoms, evaluate, abnormal, electrocardiograms, assess, risk, of, developing, arrhythmias, in, the, future, and, design, treatment, these, procedures, increasingly, include, therapeutic, methods, typically, radiofrequency, ablation, or, cryoablation, in, addition, to, diagnostic, and, prognostic, procedures, other, therapeutic, modalities, employed, in, this, field, include, antiarrhythmic, drug, therapy, and, implantation, of, pacemakers, and, automatic, implantable, cardioverter, defibrillators, aicd, the, cardiac, electrophysiology, study, typically, measures, the, response, of, the, injured, or, cardiomyopathic, myocardium, to, pes, on, specific, pharmacological, regimens, in, order, to, assess, the, likelihood, that, the, regimen, will, successfully, prevent, potentially, fatal, sustained, ventricular, tachycardia, vt, or, ventricular, fibrillation, vf, in, the, future, sometimes, a, series, of, electrophysiology, study, drug, trials, must, be, conducted, to, enable, the, cardiologist, to, select, the, one, regimen, for, long, term, treatment, that, best, prevents, or, slows, the, development, of, vt, or, vf, following, pes, such, studies, may, also, be, conducted, in, the, presence, of, a, newly, implanted, or, newly, replaced, cardiac, pacemaker, or, aicd, clinical, cardiac, electrophysiology, is, a, branch, of, the, medical, specialty, of, cardiology, and, is, concerned, with, the, study, and, treatment, of, rhythm, disorders, of, the, heart, cardiologists, with, expertise, in, this, area, are, usually, referred, to, as, electrophysiologists, electrophysiologists, are, trained, in, the, mechanism, function, and, performance, of, the, electrical, activities, of, the, heart, electrophysiologists, work, closely, with, other, cardiologists, and, cardiac, surgeons, to, assist, or, guide, therapy, for, heart, rhythm, disturbances, arrhythmias, they, are, trained, to, perform, interventional, and, surgical, procedures, to, treat, cardiac, arrhythmia, the, training, required, to, become, an, electrophysiologist, is, long, and, requires, eight, years, after, medical, school, within, the, u, s, three, years, of, internal, medicine, residency, three, years, of, cardiology, fellowship, and, two, years, of, clinical, cardiac, electrophysiology, cardiogeriatrics, or, geriatric, cardiology, is, the, branch, of, cardiology, and, geriatric, medicine, that, deals, with, the, cardiovascular, disorders, in, elderly, people, cardiac, disorders, such, as, coronary, heart, disease, including, myocardial, infarction, heart, failure, cardiomyopathy, and, arrhythmias, such, as, atrial, fibrillation, are, common, and, are, a, major, cause, of, mortality, in, elderly, people, vascular, disorders, such, as, atherosclerosis, and, peripheral, arterial, disease, cause, significant, morbidity, and, mortality, in, aged, people, cardiac, imaging, includes, echocardiography, echo, cardiac, magnetic, resonance, imaging, cmr, and, computed, tomography, of, the, heart, those, who, specialize, in, cardiac, imaging, may, undergo, more, training, in, all, imaging, modes, or, focus, on, a, single, imaging, modality, echocardiography, or, echo, uses, standard, two, dimensional, three, dimensional, and, doppler, ultrasound, to, create, images, of, the, heart, it, is, used, to, evaluate, and, quantify, cardiac, size, and, function, valvular, function, and, can, assist, with, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, conditions, including, heart, failure, heart, attack, valvular, heart, disease, congenital, heart, defects, pericardial, disease, and, aortic, disease, those, who, specialize, in, echo, may, spend, a, significant, amount, of, their, clinical, time, reading, echos, and, performing, transesophageal, echo, in, particular, using, the, latter, during, procedures, such, as, insertion, of, a, left, atrial, appendage, occlusion, device, transesophageal, echo, provides, higher, spatial, resolution, than, trans, thoracic, echocardiography, and, because, the, probe, is, located, in, the, esophagus, it, is, not, limited, by, attenuation, due, to, anterior, chest, structures, such, as, the, ribs, chest, wall, breasts, lungs, that, can, hinder, the, quality, of, trans, thoracic, echocardiography, it, is, generally, indicated, for, a, variety, of, indications, including, when, the, standard, transthoracic, echocardiogram, is, non, diagnostic, for, detailed, evaluation, of, abnormalities, that, are, typically, in, the, far, field, such, as, the, aorta, left, atrial, appendage, evaluation, of, native, or, prosthetic, heart, valves, evaluation, of, cardiac, masses, evaluation, of, endocarditis, valvular, abscesses, or, for, the, evaluation, of, cardiac, source, of, embolus, it, is, frequently, used, in, the, setting, of, atrial, fibrillation, or, atrial, flutter, to, facilitate, the, clinical, decision, with, regard, to, anticoagulation, cardioversion, and, or, radio, frequency, ablation, cardiac, mri, utilizes, special, protocols, to, image, heart, structure, and, function, with, specific, sequences, for, certain, diseases, such, as, hemochromatosis, and, amyloidosis, cardiac, ct, utilizes, special, protocols, to, image, heart, structure, and, function, with, particular, emphasis, on, coronary, arteries, interventional, cardiology, is, a, branch, of, cardiology, that, deals, specifically, with, the, catheter, based, treatment, of, structural, heart, diseases, a, large, number, of, procedures, can, be, performed, on, the, heart, by, catheterization, including, angiogram, angioplasty, atherectomy, and, stent, implantation, these, procedures, all, involve, insertion, of, a, sheath, into, the, femoral, artery, or, radial, artery, but, in, practice, any, large, peripheral, artery, or, vein, and, cannulating, the, heart, under, x, ray, visualization, most, commonly, fluoroscopy, this, cannulation, allows, indirect, access, to, the, heart, bypassing, the, trauma, caused, by, surgical, opening, of, the, chest, the, main, advantages, of, using, the, interventional, cardiology, or, radiology, approach, are, the, avoidance, of, the, scars, and, pain, and, long, post, operative, recovery, additionally, interventional, cardiology, procedure, of, primary, angioplasty, is, now, the, gold, standard, of, care, for, an, acute, myocardial, infarction, this, procedure, can, also, be, done, proactively, when, areas, of, the, vascular, system, become, occluded, from, atherosclerosis, the, cardiologist, will, thread, this, sheath, through, the, vascular, system, to, access, the, heart, this, sheath, has, a, balloon, and, a, tiny, wire, mesh, tube, wrapped, around, it, and, if, the, cardiologist, finds, a, blockage, or, stenosis, they, can, inflate, the, balloon, at, the, occlusion, site, in, the, vascular, system, to, flatten, or, compress, the, plaque, against, the, vascular, wall, once, that, is, complete, a, stent, is, placed, as, a, type, of, scaffold, to, hold, the, vasculature, open, permanently, a, relatively, newer, specialization, of, cardiology, is, in, the, field, of, heart, failure, and, heart, transplant, cardiomyopathy, is, a, disease, of, the, heart, muscle, that, make, it, larger, or, stiffer, sometimes, making, the, heart, worse, at, pumping, blood, specialization, of, general, cardiology, to, just, that, of, the, cardiomyopathies, leads, to, also, specializing, in, heart, transplant, and, pulmonary, hypertension, a, recent, specialization, of, cardiology, is, that, of, cardiooncology, this, area, specializes, in, the, cardiac, management, in, those, with, cancer, and, in, particular, those, with, plans, for, chemotherapy, or, those, who, have, experienced, cardiac, complications, of, chemotherapy, in, recent, times, the, focus, is, gradually, shifting, to, preventive, cardiology, due, to, increased, cardiovascular, disease, burden, at, an, early, age, according, to, the, who, 37, of, all, premature, deaths, are, due, to, cardiovascular, diseases, and, out, of, this, 82, are, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, clinical, cardiology, is, the, sub, specialty, of, cardiology, which, looks, after, preventive, cardiology, and, cardiac, rehabilitation, preventive, cardiology, also, deals, with, routine, preventive, checkup, though, noninvasive, tests, specifically, electrocardiography, fasegraphy, stress, tests, lipid, profile, and, general, physical, examination, to, detect, any, cardiovascular, diseases, at, an, early, age, while, cardiac, rehabilitation, is, the, upcoming, branch, of, cardiology, which, helps, a, person, regain, their, overall, strength, and, live, a, normal, life, after, a, cardiovascular, event, a, subspecialty, of, preventive, cardiology, is, sports, cardiology, because, heart, disease, is, the, leading, cause, of, death, in, the, world, including, united, states, cdc, gov, national, health, campaigns, and, randomized, control, research, has, developed, to, improve, heart, health, helen, b, taussig, is, known, as, the, founder, of, pediatric, cardiology, she, became, famous, through, her, work, with, tetralogy, congenital, heart, defect, in, which, oxygenated, and, deoxygenated, blood, enters, the, circulatory, system, resulting, from, a, ventricular, septal, defect, vsd, right, beneath, the, aorta, this, condition, causes, newborns, to, have, a, bluish, tint, cyanosis, and, have, a, deficiency, of, oxygen, to, their, tissues, hypoxemia, she, worked, with, alfred, blalock, and, vivien, thomas, at, the, johns, hopkins, hospital, where, they, experimented, with, dogs, to, look, at, how, they, would, attempt, to, surgically, cure, these, blue, babies, they, eventually, figured, out, how, to, do, just, that, by, the, anastomosis, of, the, systemic, artery, to, the, pulmonary, artery, and, called, this, the, blalock, taussig, shunt, tetralogy, of, fallot, pulmonary, atresia, double, outlet, right, ventricle, transposition, of, the, great, arteries, persistent, truncus, arteriosus, and, ebstein, s, anomaly, are, various, congenital, cyanotic, heart, diseases, in, which, the, blood, of, the, newborn, is, not, oxygenated, efficiently, due, to, the, heart, defect, as, more, children, with, congenital, heart, disease, are, surviving, into, adulthood, a, hybrid, of, adult, and, pediatric, cardiology, has, emerged, called, adult, congenital, heart, disease, achd, this, field, can, be, entered, as, either, adult, or, pediatric, cardiology, achd, specializes, in, congenital, diseases, in, the, setting, of, adult, diseases, e, g, coronary, artery, disease, copd, diabetes, that, is, otherwise, atypical, for, adult, or, pediatric, cardiology, as, the, center, focus, of, cardiology, the, heart, has, numerous, anatomical, features, e, g, atria, ventricles, heart, valves, and, numerous, physiological, features, e, g, systole, heart, sounds, afterload, that, have, been, encyclopedically, documented, for, many, centuries, the, heart, is, located, in, the, middle, of, the, abdomen, with, its, tip, slightly, towards, the, left, side, of, the, abdomen, disorders, of, the, heart, lead, to, heart, disease, and, cardiovascular, disease, and, can, lead, to, a, significant, number, of, deaths, cardiovascular, disease, is, the, leading, cause, of, death, in, the, u, s, and, caused, 24, 95, of, total, deaths, in, 2008, the, primary, responsibility, of, the, heart, is, to, pump, blood, throughout, the, body, it, pumps, blood, from, the, body, called, the, systemic, circulation, through, the, lungs, called, the, pulmonary, circulation, and, then, back, out, to, the, body, this, means, that, the, heart, is, connected, to, and, affects, the, entirety, of, the, body, simplified, the, heart, is, a, circuit, of, the, circulation, while, plenty, is, known, about, the, healthy, heart, the, bulk, of, study, in, cardiology, is, in, disorders, of, the, heart, and, restoration, and, where, possible, of, function, the, heart, is, a, muscle, that, squeezes, blood, and, functions, like, a, pump, the, heart, s, systems, can, be, classified, as, either, electrical, or, mechanical, and, both, of, these, systems, are, susceptible, to, failure, or, dysfunction, the, electrical, system, of, the, heart, is, centered, on, the, periodic, contraction, squeezing, of, the, muscle, cells, that, is, caused, by, the, cardiac, pacemaker, located, in, the, sinoatrial, node, the, study, of, the, electrical, aspects, is, a, sub, field, of, electrophysiology, called, cardiac, electrophysiology, and, is, epitomized, with, the, electrocardiogram, ecg, ekg, the, action, potentials, generated, in, the, pacemaker, propagate, throughout, the, heart, in, a, specific, pattern, the, system, that, carries, this, potential, is, called, the, electrical, conduction, system, dysfunction, of, the, electrical, system, manifests, in, many, ways, and, may, include, wolff, parkinson, white, syndrome, ventricular, fibrillation, and, heart, block, the, mechanical, system, of, the, heart, is, centered, on, the, fluidic, movement, of, blood, and, the, functionality, of, the, heart, as, a, pump, the, mechanical, part, is, ultimately, the, purpose, of, the, heart, and, many, of, the, disorders, of, the, heart, disrupt, the, ability, to, move, blood, heart, failure, is, one, condition, in, which, the, mechanical, properties, of, the, heart, have, failed, or, are, failing, which, means, insufficient, blood, is, being, circulated, failure, to, move, a, sufficient, amount, of, blood, through, the, body, can, cause, damage, or, failure, of, other, organs, and, may, result, in, death, if, severe, coronary, circulation, is, the, circulation, of, blood, in, the, blood, vessels, of, the, heart, muscle, the, myocardium, the, vessels, that, deliver, oxygen, rich, blood, to, the, myocardium, are, known, as, coronary, arteries, the, vessels, that, remove, the, deoxygenated, blood, from, the, heart, muscle, are, known, as, cardiac, veins, these, include, the, great, cardiac, vein, the, middle, cardiac, vein, the, small, cardiac, vein, and, the, anterior, cardiac, veins, as, the, left, and, right, coronary, arteries, run, on, the, surface, of, the, heart, they, can, be, called, epicardial, coronary, arteries, these, arteries, when, healthy, are, capable, of, autoregulation, to, maintain, coronary, blood, flow, at, levels, appropriate, to, the, needs, of, the, heart, muscle, these, relatively, narrow, vessels, are, commonly, affected, by, atherosclerosis, and, can, become, blocked, causing, angina, or, myocardial, infarction, a, k, a, a, heart, attack, the, coronary, arteries, that, run, deep, within, the, myocardium, are, referred, to, as, subendocardial, the, coronary, arteries, are, classified, as, end, circulation, since, they, represent, the, only, source, of, blood, supply, to, the, myocardium, there, is, very, little, redundant, blood, supply, which, is, why, blockage, of, these, vessels, can, be, so, critical, the, cardiac, examination, also, called, the, precordial, exam, is, performed, as, part, of, a, physical, examination, or, when, a, patient, presents, with, chest, pain, suggestive, of, a, cardiovascular, pathology, it, would, typically, be, modified, depending, on, the, indication, and, integrated, with, other, examinations, especially, the, respiratory, examination, like, all, medical, examinations, the, cardiac, examination, follows, the, standard, structure, of, inspection, palpation, and, auscultation, cardiology, is, concerned, with, the, normal, functionality, of, the, heart, and, the, deviation, from, a, healthy, heart, many, disorders, involve, the, heart, itself, but, some, are, outside, of, the, heart, and, in, the, vascular, system, collectively, the, two, are, jointly, termed, the, cardiovascular, system, and, diseases, of, one, part, tend, to, affect, the, other, coronary, artery, disease, also, known, as, ischemic, heart, disease, is, a, group, of, diseases, that, includes, stable, angina, unstable, angina, myocardial, infarction, and, is, one, of, the, causes, of, sudden, cardiac, death, it, is, within, the, group, of, cardiovascular, diseases, of, which, it, is, the, most, common, type, a, common, symptom, is, chest, pain, or, discomfort, which, may, travel, into, the, shoulder, arm, back, neck, or, jaw, occasionally, it, may, feel, like, heartburn, usually, symptoms, occur, with, exercise, or, emotional, stress, last, less, than, a, few, minutes, and, get, better, with, rest, shortness, of, breath, may, also, occur, and, sometimes, no, symptoms, are, present, the, first, sign, is, occasionally, a, heart, attack, other, complications, include, heart, failure, or, an, irregular, heartbeat, risk, factors, include, high, blood, pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack, of, exercise, obesity, high, blood, cholesterol, poor, diet, and, excessive, alcohol, among, others, other, risks, include, depression, the, underlying, mechanism, involves, atherosclerosis, of, the, arteries, of, the, heart, a, number, of, tests, may, help, with, diagnoses, including, electrocardiogram, cardiac, stress, testing, coronary, computed, tomographic, angiography, and, coronary, angiogram, among, others, prevention, is, by, eating, a, healthy, diet, regular, exercise, maintaining, a, healthy, weight, and, not, smoking, sometimes, medication, for, diabetes, high, cholesterol, or, high, blood, pressure, are, also, used, there, is, limited, evidence, for, screening, people, who, are, at, low, risk, and, do, not, have, symptoms, treatment, involves, the, same, measures, as, prevention, additional, medications, such, as, antiplatelets, including, aspirin, beta, blockers, or, nitroglycerin, may, be, recommended, procedures, such, as, percutaneous, coronary, intervention, pci, or, coronary, artery, bypass, surgery, cabg, may, be, used, in, severe, disease, in, those, with, stable, cad, it, is, unclear, if, pci, or, cabg, in, addition, to, the, other, treatments, improve, life, expectancy, or, decreases, heart, attack, risk, in, 2013, cad, was, the, most, common, cause, of, death, globally, resulting, in, 8, 14, million, deaths, 16, 8, up, from, 5, 74, million, deaths, 12, in, 1990, the, risk, of, death, from, cad, for, a, given, age, has, decreased, between, 1980, and, 2010, especially, in, developed, countries, the, number, of, cases, of, cad, for, a, given, age, has, also, decreased, between, 1990, and, 2010, in, the, u, s, in, 2010, about, 20, of, those, over, 65, had, cad, while, it, was, present, in, 7, of, those, 45, to, 64, and, 1, 3, of, those, 18, to, 45, rates, are, higher, among, men, than, women, of, a, given, age, heart, failure, or, formally, cardiomyopathy, is, the, impaired, function, of, the, heart, and, there, are, numerous, causes, and, forms, of, heart, failure, cardiac, arrhythmia, also, known, as, cardiac, dysrhythmia, or, irregular, heartbeat, is, a, group, of, conditions, in, which, the, heartbeat, is, too, fast, too, slow, or, irregular, in, its, rhythm, a, heart, rate, that, is, too, fast, above, 100, beats, per, minute, in, adults, is, called, tachycardia, a, heart, rate, that, is, too, slow, below, 60, beats, per, minute, is, called, bradycardia, many, types, of, arrhythmia, present, no, symptoms, when, symptoms, are, present, they, may, include, palpitations, or, feeling, a, pause, between, heartbeats, more, serious, symptoms, may, include, lightheadedness, passing, out, shortness, of, breath, or, chest, pain, while, most, types, of, arrhythmia, are, not, serious, some, predispose, a, person, to, complications, such, as, stroke, or, heart, failure, others, may, result, in, cardiac, arrest, there, are, four, main, types, of, arrhythmia, extra, beats, supraventricular, tachycardias, ventricular, arrhythmias, and, bradyarrhythmias, extra, beats, include, premature, atrial, contractions, premature, ventricular, contractions, and, premature, junctional, contractions, supraventricular, tachycardias, include, atrial, fibrillation, atrial, flutter, and, paroxysmal, supraventricular, tachycardia, ventricular, arrhythmias, include, ventricular, fibrillation, and, ventricular, tachycardia, arrhythmias, are, due, to, problems, with, the, electrical, conduction, system, of, the, heart, arrhythmias, may, occur, in, children, however, the, normal, range, for, the, heart, rate, is, different, and, depends, on, age, a, number, of, tests, can, help, diagnose, arrhythmia, including, an, electrocardiogram, and, holter, monitor, most, arrhythmias, can, be, effectively, treated, treatments, may, include, medications, medical, procedures, such, as, a, pacemaker, and, surgery, medications, for, a, fast, heart, rate, may, include, beta, blockers, or, agents, that, attempt, to, restore, a, normal, heart, rhythm, such, as, procainamide, this, later, group, may, have, more, significant, side, effects, especially, if, taken, for, a, long, period, of, time, pacemakers, are, often, used, for, slow, heart, rates, those, with, an, irregular, heartbeat, are, often, treated, with, blood, thinners, to, reduce, the, risk, of, complications, those, who, have, severe, symptoms, from, an, arrhythmia, may, receive, urgent, treatment, with, a, jolt, of, electricity, in, the, form, of, cardioversion, or, defibrillation, arrhythmia, affects, millions, of, people, in, europe, and, north, america, as, of, 2014, atrial, fibrillation, affects, about, 2, to, 3, of, the, population, atrial, fibrillation, and, atrial, flutter, resulted, in, 112, 000, deaths, in, 2013, up, from, 29, 000, in, 1990, sudden, cardiac, death, is, the, cause, of, about, half, of, deaths, due, to, cardiovascular, disease, or, about, 15, of, all, deaths, globally, about, 80, of, sudden, cardiac, death, is, the, result, of, ventricular, arrhythmias, arrhythmias, may, occur, at, any, age, but, are, more, common, among, older, people, cardiac, arrest, is, a, sudden, stop, in, effective, blood, flow, due, to, the, failure, of, the, heart, to, contract, effectively, symptoms, include, loss, of, consciousness, and, abnormal, or, absent, breathing, some, people, may, have, chest, pain, shortness, of, breath, or, nausea, before, this, occurs, if, not, treated, within, minutes, death, usually, occurs, the, most, common, cause, of, cardiac, arrest, is, coronary, artery, disease, less, common, causes, include, major, blood, loss, lack, of, oxygen, very, low, potassium, heart, failure, and, intense, physical, exercise, a, number, of, inherited, disorders, may, also, increase, the, risk, including, long, qt, syndrome, the, initial, heart, rhythm, is, most, often, ventricular, fibrillation, the, diagnosis, is, confirmed, by, finding, no, pulse, while, a, cardiac, arrest, may, be, caused, by, heart, attack, or, heart, failure, these, are, not, the, same, prevention, includes, not, smoking, physical, activity, and, maintaining, a, healthy, weight, treatment, for, cardiac, arrest, is, immediate, cardiopulmonary, resuscitation, cpr, and, if, a, shockable, rhythm, is, present, defibrillation, among, those, who, survive, targeted, temperature, management, may, improve, outcomes, an, implantable, cardiac, defibrillator, may, be, placed, to, reduce, the, chance, of, death, from, recurrence, in, the, united, states, cardiac, arrest, outside, of, hospital, occurs, in, about, 13, per, 10, 000, people, per, year, 326, 000, cases, in, hospital, cardiac, arrest, occurs, in, an, additional, 209, 000, cardiac, arrest, becomes, more, common, with, age, it, affects, males, more, often, than, females, the, percentage, of, people, who, survive, with, treatment, is, about, 8, many, who, survive, have, significant, disability, many, u, s, television, shows, however, have, portrayed, unrealistically, high, survival, rates, of, 67, hypertension, also, known, as, high, blood, pressure, is, a, long, term, medical, condition, in, which, the, blood, pressure, in, the, arteries, is, persistently, elevated, high, blood, pressure, usually, does, not, cause, symptoms, long, term, high, blood, pressure, however, is, a, major, risk, factor, for, coronary, artery, disease, stroke, heart, failure, peripheral, vascular, disease, vision, loss, and, chronic, kidney, disease, lifestyle, factors, can, increase, the, risk, of, hypertension, these, include, excess, salt, in, the, diet, excess, body, weight, smoking, and, alcohol, consumption, hypertension, can, also, be, caused, by, other, diseases, or, occur, as, a, side, effect, of, drugs, blood, pressure, is, expressed, by, two, measurements, the, systolic, and, diastolic, pressures, which, are, the, maximum, and, minimum, pressures, respectively, normal, blood, pressure, when, at, rest, is, within, the, range, of, 100, 140, millimeters, mercury, mmhg, systolic, and, 60, 90, mmhg, diastolic, high, blood, pressure, is, present, if, the, resting, blood, pressure, is, persistently, at, or, above, 140, 90, mmhg, for, most, adults, different, numbers, apply, to, children, when, diagnosing, high, blood, pressure, ambulatory, blood, pressure, monitoring, over, a, 24, hour, period, appears, to, be, more, accurate, than, in, office, blood, pressure, measurement, at, a, physician, s, office, or, other, blood, pressure, screening, location, lifestyle, changes, and, medications, can, lower, blood, pressure, and, decrease, the, risk, of, health, complications, lifestyle, changes, include, weight, loss, decreased, salt, intake, physical, exercise, and, a, healthy, diet, if, changes, in, lifestyle, are, insufficient, blood, pressure, medications, may, be, used, a, regimen, of, up, to, three, medications, effectively, controls, blood, pressure, in, 90, of, people, the, treatment, of, moderate, to, severe, high, arterial, blood, pressure, defined, as, 160, 100, mmhg, with, medication, is, associated, with, an, improved, life, expectancy, and, reduced, morbidity, the, effect, of, treatment, for, blood, pressure, between, 140, 90, mmhg, and, 160, 100, mmhg, is, less, clear, with, some, studies, finding, benefits, while, others, do, not, high, blood, pressure, affects, between, 16, and, 37, of, the, population, globally, in, 2010, hypertension, was, believed, to, have, been, a, factor, in, 18, 9, 4, million, deaths, essential, hypertension, is, the, form, of, hypertension, that, by, definition, has, no, identifiable, cause, it, is, the, most, common, type, of, hypertension, affecting, 95, of, hypertensive, patients, it, tends, to, be, familial, and, is, likely, to, be, the, consequence, of, an, interaction, between, environmental, and, genetic, factors, prevalence, of, essential, hypertension, increases, with, age, and, individuals, with, relatively, high, blood, pressure, at, younger, ages, are, at, increased, risk, for, the, subsequent, development, of, hypertension, hypertension, can, increase, the, risk, of, cerebral, cardiac, and, renal, events, secondary, hypertension, is, a, type, of, hypertension, which, is, caused, by, an, identifiable, underlying, secondary, cause, it, is, much, less, common, than, essential, hypertension, affecting, only, 5, of, hypertensive, patients, it, has, many, different, causes, including, endocrine, diseases, kidney, diseases, and, tumors, it, also, can, be, a, side, effect, of, many, medications, complications, of, hypertension, are, clinical, outcomes, that, result, from, persistent, elevation, of, blood, pressure, hypertension, is, a, risk, factor, for, all, clinical, manifestations, of, atherosclerosis, since, it, is, a, risk, factor, for, atherosclerosis, itself, it, is, an, independent, predisposing, factor, for, heart, failure, coronary, artery, disease, stroke, renal, disease, and, peripheral, arterial, disease, it, is, the, most, important, risk, factor, for, cardiovascular, morbidity, and, mortality, in, industrialized, countries, a, congenital, heart, defect, also, known, as, a, congenital, heart, anomaly, or, congenital, heart, disease, is, a, problem, in, the, structure, of, the, heart, that, is, present, at, birth, signs, and, symptoms, depend, on, the, specific, type, of, problem, symptoms, can, vary, from, none, to, life, threatening, when, present, they, may, include, rapid, breathing, bluish, skin, poor, weight, gain, and, feeling, tired, it, does, not, cause, chest, pain, most, congenital, heart, problems, do, not, occur, with, other, diseases, complications, that, can, result, from, heart, defects, include, heart, failure, the, cause, of, a, congenital, heart, defect, is, often, unknown, certain, cases, may, be, due, to, infections, during, pregnancy, such, as, rubella, use, of, certain, medications, or, drugs, such, as, alcohol, or, tobacco, parents, being, closely, related, or, poor, nutritional, status, or, obesity, in, the, mother, having, a, parent, with, a, congenital, heart, defect, is, also, a, risk, factor, a, number, of, genetic, conditions, are, associated, with, heart, defects, including, down, syndrome, turner, syndrome, and, marfan, syndrome, congenital, heart, defects, are, divided, into, two, main, groups, cyanotic, heart, defects, and, non, cyanotic, heart, defects, depending, on, whether, the, child, has, the, potential, to, turn, bluish, in, color, the, problems, may, involve, the, interior, walls, of, the, heart, the, heart, valves, or, the, large, blood, vessels, that, lead, to, and, from, the, heart, congenital, heart, defects, are, partly, preventable, through, rubella, vaccination, the, adding, of, iodine, to, salt, and, the, adding, of, folic, acid, to, certain, food, products, some, defects, do, not, need, treatment, other, may, be, effectively, treated, with, catheter, based, procedures, or, heart, surgery, occasionally, a, number, of, operations, may, be, needed, occasionally, heart, transplantation, is, required, with, appropriate, treatment, outcomes, even, with, complex, problems, are, generally, good, heart, defects, are, the, most, common, birth, defect, in, 2013, they, were, present, in, 34, 3, million, people, globally, they, affect, between, 4, and, 75, per, 1, 000, live, births, depending, upon, how, they, are, diagnosed, about, 6, to, 19, per, 1, 000, cause, a, moderate, to, severe, degree, of, problems, congenital, heart, defects, are, the, leading, cause, of, birth, defect, related, deaths, in, 2013, they, resulted, in, 323, 000, deaths, down, from, 366, 000, deaths, in, 1990, tetralogy, of, fallot, is, the, most, common, congenital, heart, disease, arising, in, 1, 3, cases, per, 1, 000, births, the, cause, of, this, defect, is, a, ventricular, septal, defect, vsd, and, an, overriding, aorta, these, two, defects, combined, causes, deoxygenated, blood, to, bypass, the, lungs, and, going, right, back, into, the, circulatory, system, the, modified, blalock, taussig, shunt, is, usually, used, to, fix, the, circulation, this, procedure, is, done, by, placing, a, graft, between, the, subclavian, artery, and, the, ipsilateral, pulmonary, artery, to, restore, the, correct, blood, flow, pulmonary, atresia, happens, in, 7, 8, per, 100, 000, births, and, is, characterized, by, the, aorta, branching, out, of, the, right, ventricle, this, causes, the, deoxygenated, blood, to, bypass, the, lungs, and, enter, the, circulatory, system, surgeries, can, fix, this, by, redirecting, the, aorta, and, fixing, the, right, ventricle, and, pulmonary, artery, connection, there, are, two, types, of, pulmonary, atresia, classified, by, whether, or, not, the, baby, also, has, a, ventricular, septal, defect, double, outlet, right, ventricle, dorv, is, when, both, great, arteries, the, pulmonary, artery, and, the, aorta, are, connected, to, the, right, ventricle, there, is, usually, a, vsd, in, different, particular, places, depending, on, the, variations, of, dorv, typically, 50, are, subaortic, and, 30, the, surgeries, that, can, be, done, to, fix, this, defect, can, vary, due, to, the, different, physiology, and, blood, flow, in, the, defected, heart, one, way, it, can, be, cured, is, by, a, vsd, closure, and, placing, conduits, to, restart, the, blood, flow, between, the, left, ventricle, and, the, aorta, and, between, the, right, ventricle, and, the, pulmonary, artery, another, way, is, systemic, to, pulmonary, artery, shunt, in, cases, associated, with, pulmonary, stenosis, also, a, balloon, atrial, septostomy, can, be, done, to, relieve, hypoxemia, caused, by, dorv, with, the, taussig, bing, anomaly, while, surgical, correction, is, awaited, there, are, two, different, types, of, transposition, of, the, great, arteries, dextro, transposition, of, the, great, arteries, and, levo, transposition, of, the, great, arteries, depending, on, where, the, chambers, and, vessels, connect, dextro, transposition, happens, in, about, 1, in, 4, 000, newborns, and, is, when, the, right, ventricle, pumps, blood, into, the, aorta, and, deoxygenated, blood, enters, the, bloodstream, the, temporary, procedure, is, to, create, an, atrial, septal, defect, a, permanent, fix, is, more, complicated, and, involves, redirecting, the, pulmonary, return, to, the, right, atrium, and, the, systemic, return, to, the, left, atrium, which, is, known, as, the, senning, procedure, the, rastelli, procedure, can, also, be, done, by, rerouting, the, left, ventricular, outflow, dividing, the, pulmonary, trunk, and, placing, a, conduit, in, between, the, right, ventricle, and, pulmonary, trunk, levo, transposition, happens, in, about, 1, in, 13, 000, newborns, and, is, characterized, by, the, left, ventricle, pumping, blood, into, the, lungs, and, the, right, ventricle, pumping, the, blood, into, the, aorta, this, may, not, produce, problems, at, the, beginning, but, will, eventually, due, to, the, different, pressures, each, ventricle, uses, to, pump, blood, switching, the, left, ventricle, to, be, the, systemic, ventricle, and, the, right, ventricle, to, pump, blood, into, the, pulmonary, artery, can, repair, levo, transposition, persistent, truncus, arteriosus, is, when, the, truncus, arteriosus, fails, to, split, into, the, aorta, and, pulmonary, trunk, this, occurs, in, about, 1, in, 11, 000, live, births, and, allows, both, oxygenated, and, deoxygenated, blood, into, the, body, the, repair, consists, of, a, vsd, closure, and, the, rastelli, procedure, ebstein, s, anomaly, is, characterized, by, a, right, atrium, that, is, significantly, enlarged, and, a, heart, that, is, shaped, like, a, box, this, is, very, rare, and, happens, in, less, than, 1, of, congenital, heart, disease, cases, the, surgical, repair, varies, depending, on, the, severity, of, the, disease, pediatric, cardiology, is, a, sub, specialty, of, pediatrics, to, become, a, pediatric, cardiologist, in, the, u, s, one, must, complete, a, three, year, residency, in, pediatrics, followed, by, a, three, year, fellowship, in, pediatric, cardiology, per, doximity, pediatric, cardiologists, make, an, average, of, 303, 917, in, the, u, s, diagnostic, tests, in, cardiology, are, the, methods, of, identifying, heart, conditions, associated, with, healthy, vs, unhealthy, pathologic, heart, function, the, starting, point, is, obtaining, a, medical, history, followed, by, auscultation, then, blood, tests, electrophysiological, procedures, and, cardiac, imaging, can, be, ordered, for, further, analysis, electrophysiological, procedures, include, electrocardiogram, cardiac, monitoring, cardiac, stress, testing, and, the, electrophysiology, study, cardiology, is, known, for, randomized, controlled, trials, that, guide, clinical, treatment, of, cardiac, diseases, while, dozens, are, published, every, year, there, are, landmark, trials, that, shift, treatment, significantly, trials, often, have, an, acronym, of, the, trial, name, and, this, acronym, is, used, to, reference, the, trial, and, its, results, some, of, these, landmark, trials, include
