population, is, the, term, typically, used, to, refer, to, the, number, of, people, in, a, single, area, governments, conduct, a, census, to, quantify, the, size, of, a, resident, population, within, a, given, jurisdiction, the, term, is, also, applied, to, non, human, animals, microorganisms, and, plants, and, has, specific, uses, within, such, fields, as, ecology, and, genetics, the, word, population, is, derived, from, the, late, latin, populationem, a, people, a, multitude, which, itself, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, populus, a, people, in, sociology, and, population, geography, population, refers, to, a, group, of, human, beings, with, some, predefined, criterion, in, common, such, as, location, race, ethnicity, nationality, or, religion, in, ecology, a, population, is, a, group, of, organisms, of, the, same, species, who, inhabit, the, same, particular, geographical, area, and, are, capable, of, interbreeding, the, area, of, a, sexual, population, is, the, area, where, inter, breeding, is, possible, between, any, pair, within, the, area, and, more, probable, than, cross, breeding, with, individuals, from, other, areas, in, ecology, the, population, of, a, certain, species, in, a, certain, area, can, be, estimated, using, the, lincoln, index, to, calculate, the, total, population, of, an, area, based, on, the, number, of, individuals, observed, in, genetics, a, population, is, often, defined, as, a, set, of, organisms, in, which, any, pair, of, members, can, breed, together, they, can, thus, routinely, exchange, gametes, in, order, to, have, usually, fertile, progeny, and, such, a, breeding, group, is, also, known, therefore, as, a, gamodeme, this, also, implies, that, all, members, belong, to, the, same, species, if, the, gamodeme, is, very, large, theoretically, approaching, infinity, and, all, gene, alleles, are, uniformly, distributed, by, the, gametes, within, it, the, gamodeme, is, said, to, be, panmictic, under, this, state, allele, gamete, frequencies, can, be, converted, to, genotype, zygote, frequencies, by, expanding, an, appropriate, quadratic, equation, as, shown, by, sir, ronald, fisher, in, his, establishment, of, quantitative, genetics, this, seldom, occurs, in, nature, localization, of, gamete, exchange, through, dispersal, limitations, preferential, mating, cataclysm, or, other, cause, may, lead, to, small, actual, gamodemes, which, exchange, gametes, reasonably, uniformly, within, themselves, but, are, virtually, separated, from, their, neighboring, gamodemes, however, there, may, be, low, frequencies, of, exchange, with, these, neighbors, this, may, be, viewed, as, the, breaking, up, of, a, large, sexual, population, panmictic, into, smaller, overlapping, sexual, populations, this, failure, of, panmixia, leads, to, two, important, changes, in, overall, population, structure, 1, the, component, gamodemes, vary, through, gamete, sampling, in, their, allele, frequencies, when, compared, with, each, other, and, with, the, theoretical, panmictic, original, this, is, known, as, dispersion, and, its, details, can, be, estimated, using, expansion, of, an, appropriate, binomial, equation, and, 2, the, level, of, homozygosity, rises, in, the, entire, collection, of, gamodemes, the, overall, rise, in, homozygosity, is, quantified, by, the, inbreeding, coefficient, f, or, all, homozygotes, are, increased, in, frequency, both, the, deleterious, and, the, desirable, the, mean, phenotype, of, the, gamodemes, collection, is, lower, than, that, of, the, panmictic, original, which, is, known, as, inbreeding, depression, it, is, most, important, to, note, however, that, some, dispersion, lines, will, be, superior, to, the, panmictic, original, while, some, will, be, about, the, same, and, some, will, be, inferior, the, probabilities, of, each, can, be, estimated, from, those, binomial, equations, in, plant, and, animal, breeding, procedures, have, been, developed, which, deliberately, utilize, the, effects, of, dispersion, such, as, line, breeding, pure, line, breeding, backcrossing, dispersion, assisted, selection, leads, to, the, greatest, genetic, advance, g, change, in, the, phenotypic, mean, and, is, much, more, powerful, than, selection, acting, without, attendant, dispersion, this, is, so, for, both, allogamous, random, fertilization, and, autogamous, self, fertilization, gamodemes, according, to, the, un, the, world, s, population, surpassed, 8, billion, on, 15, november, 2022, a, gain, of, 1, billion, since, 12, march, 2012, according, to, a, separate, estimate, by, the, united, nations, earth, s, population, exceeded, seven, billion, in, october, 2011, according, to, unfpa, growth, to, such, an, extent, offers, unprecedented, challenges, and, opportunities, to, all, of, humanity, according, to, papers, published, by, the, united, states, census, bureau, the, world, population, hit, 6, 5, billion, on, 24, february, 2006, the, united, nations, population, fund, designated, 12, october, 1999, as, the, approximate, day, on, which, world, population, reached, 6, billion, this, was, about, 12, years, after, the, world, population, reached, 5, billion, in, 1987, and, six, years, after, the, world, population, reached, 5, 5, billion, in, 1993, the, population, of, countries, such, as, nigeria, is, not, even, known, to, the, nearest, million, so, there, is, a, considerable, margin, of, error, in, such, estimates, researcher, carl, haub, calculated, that, a, total, of, over, 100, billion, people, have, probably, been, born, in, the, last, 2000, years, population, growth, increased, significantly, as, the, industrial, revolution, gathered, pace, from, 1700, onwards, the, last, 50, years, have, seen, a, yet, more, rapid, increase, in, the, rate, of, population, growth, due, to, medical, advances, and, substantial, increases, in, agricultural, productivity, particularly, beginning, in, the, 1960s, made, by, the, green, revolution, in, 2017, the, united, nations, population, division, projected, that, the, world, s, population, will, reach, about, 9, 8, billion, in, 2050, and, 11, 2, billion, in, 2100, in, the, future, the, world, s, population, is, expected, to, peak, after, which, it, will, decline, due, to, economic, reasons, health, concerns, land, exhaustion, and, environmental, hazards, according, to, one, report, it, is, very, likely, that, the, world, s, population, will, stop, growing, before, the, end, of, the, 21st, century, further, there, is, some, likelihood, that, population, will, actually, decline, before, 2100, population, has, already, declined, in, the, last, decade, or, two, in, eastern, europe, the, baltics, and, in, the, commonwealth, of, independent, states, the, population, pattern, of, less, developed, regions, of, the, world, in, recent, years, has, been, marked, by, gradually, declining, birth, rates, these, followed, an, earlier, sharp, reduction, in, death, rates, this, transition, from, high, birth, and, death, rates, to, low, birth, and, death, rates, is, often, referred, to, as, the, demographic, transition, human, population, planning, is, the, practice, of, altering, the, rate, of, growth, of, a, human, population, historically, human, population, control, has, been, implemented, with, the, goal, of, limiting, the, rate, of, population, growth, in, the, period, from, the, 1950s, to, the, 1980s, concerns, about, global, population, growth, and, its, effects, on, poverty, environmental, degradation, and, political, stability, led, to, efforts, to, reduce, population, growth, rates, while, population, control, can, involve, measures, that, improve, people, s, lives, by, giving, them, greater, control, of, their, reproduction, a, few, programs, most, notably, the, chinese, government, s, one, child, per, family, policy, have, resorted, to, coercive, measures, in, the, 1970s, tension, grew, between, population, control, advocates, and, women, s, health, activists, who, advanced, women, s, reproductive, rights, as, part, of, a, human, rights, based, approach, growing, opposition, to, the, narrow, population, control, focus, led, to, a, significant, change, in, population, control, policies, in, the, early, 1980s
