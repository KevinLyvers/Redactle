umbelliferae, apiaceae, e, p, i, e, s, i, a, s, i, i, or, umbelliferae, is, a, family, of, mostly, aromatic, flowering, plants, named, after, the, type, genus, apium, and, commonly, known, as, the, celery, carrot, or, parsley, family, or, simply, as, umbellifers, it, is, the, 16th, largest, family, of, flowering, plants, with, more, than, 3, 800, species, in, about, 446, genera, including, such, well, known, and, economically, important, plants, as, ajwain, angelica, anise, asafoetida, caraway, carrot, celery, chervil, coriander, cumin, dill, fennel, lovage, cow, parsley, parsley, parsnip, and, sea, holly, as, well, as, silphium, a, plant, whose, exact, identity, is, unclear, and, may, be, extinct, the, family, apiaceae, includes, a, significant, number, of, phototoxic, species, such, as, giant, hogweed, and, a, smaller, number, of, highly, poisonous, species, such, as, poison, hemlock, water, hemlock, spotted, cowbane, fool, s, parsley, and, various, species, of, water, dropwort, most, apiaceae, are, annual, biennial, or, perennial, herbs, frequently, with, the, leaves, aggregated, toward, the, base, though, a, minority, are, woody, shrubs, or, small, trees, such, as, bupleurum, fruticosum, 35, their, leaves, are, of, variable, size, and, alternately, arranged, or, with, the, upper, leaves, becoming, nearly, opposite, the, leaves, may, be, petiolate, or, sessile, there, are, no, stipules, but, the, petioles, are, frequently, sheathing, and, the, leaves, may, be, perfoliate, the, leaf, blade, is, usually, dissected, ternate, or, pinnatifid, but, simple, and, entire, in, some, genera, e, g, bupleurum, commonly, their, leaves, emit, a, marked, smell, when, crushed, aromatic, to, fetid, but, absent, in, some, species, the, defining, characteristic, of, this, family, is, the, inflorescence, the, flowers, nearly, always, aggregated, in, terminal, umbels, that, may, be, simple, or, more, commonly, compound, often, umbelliform, cymes, the, flowers, are, usually, perfect, hermaphroditic, and, actinomorphic, but, there, may, be, zygomorphic, flowers, at, the, edge, of, the, umbel, as, in, carrot, daucus, carota, and, coriander, with, petals, of, unequal, size, the, ones, pointing, outward, from, the, umbel, larger, than, the, ones, pointing, inward, some, are, andromonoecious, polygamomonoecious, or, even, dioecious, as, in, acronema, with, a, distinct, calyx, and, corolla, but, the, calyx, is, often, highly, reduced, to, the, point, of, being, undetectable, in, many, species, while, the, corolla, can, be, white, yellow, pink, or, purple, the, flowers, are, nearly, perfectly, pentamerous, with, five, petals, and, five, stamens, there, is, often, variation, in, the, functionality, of, the, stamens, even, within, a, single, inflorescence, some, flowers, are, functionally, staminate, where, a, pistil, may, be, present, but, has, no, ovules, capable, of, being, fertilized, while, others, are, functionally, pistillate, where, stamens, are, present, but, their, anthers, do, not, produce, viable, pollen, pollination, of, one, flower, by, the, pollen, of, a, different, flower, of, the, same, plant, geitonogamy, is, common, the, gynoecium, consists, of, two, carpels, fused, into, a, single, bicarpellate, pistil, with, an, inferior, ovary, stylopodia, support, two, styles, and, secrete, nectar, attracting, pollinators, like, flies, mosquitoes, gnats, beetles, moths, and, bees, the, fruit, is, a, schizocarp, consisting, of, two, fused, carpels, that, separate, at, maturity, into, two, mericarps, each, containing, a, single, seed, the, fruits, of, many, species, are, dispersed, by, wind, but, others, such, as, those, of, daucus, spp, are, covered, in, bristles, which, may, be, hooked, in, sanicle, sanicula, europaea, and, thus, catch, in, the, fur, of, animals, the, seeds, have, an, oily, endosperm, and, often, contain, essential, oils, containing, aromatic, compounds, that, are, responsible, for, the, flavour, of, commercially, important, umbelliferous, seed, such, as, anise, cumin, and, coriander, the, shape, and, details, of, the, ornamentation, of, the, ripe, fruits, are, important, for, identification, to, species, level, 802, apiaceae, was, first, described, by, john, lindley, in, 1836, the, name, is, derived, from, the, type, genus, apium, which, was, originally, used, by, pliny, the, elder, circa, 50, ad, for, a, celery, like, plant, the, alternative, name, for, the, family, umbelliferae, derives, from, the, inflorescence, being, generally, in, the, form, of, a, compound, umbel, the, family, was, one, of, the, first, to, be, recognized, as, a, distinct, group, in, jacques, daleschamps, 1586, historia, generalis, plantarum, with, robert, morison, s, 1672, plantarum, umbelliferarum, distribution, nova, it, became, the, first, group, of, plants, for, which, a, systematic, study, was, published, the, family, is, solidly, placed, within, the, apiales, order, in, the, apg, iii, system, it, is, closely, related, to, araliaceae, and, the, boundaries, between, these, families, remain, unclear, traditionally, groups, within, the, family, have, been, delimited, largely, based, on, fruit, morphology, and, the, results, from, this, have, not, been, congruent, with, the, more, recent, molecular, phylogenetic, analyses, the, subfamilial, and, tribal, classification, for, the, family, is, currently, in, a, state, of, flux, with, many, of, the, groups, being, found, to, be, grossly, paraphyletic, or, polyphyletic, prior, to, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, the, family, was, subdivided, primarily, based, on, fruit, characteristics, molecular, phylogenetic, analyses, from, the, mid, 1990s, onwards, have, shown, that, fruit, characters, evolved, in, parallel, many, times, so, that, using, them, in, classification, resulted, in, units, that, were, not, monophyletic, in, 2004, it, was, proposed, that, apiaceae, should, be, divided, into, four, subfamilies, apioideae, is, by, far, the, largest, subfamily, with, about, 90, of, the, genera, most, subsequent, studies, have, supported, this, division, although, leaving, some, genera, unplaced, a, 2021, study, suggested, the, relationships, shown, in, the, following, cladogram, platysace, mackinlayoideae, klotzschia, azorelloideae, hermas, phlyctidocarpa, saniculoideae, apioideae, the, platysace, clade, and, the, genera, klotzschia, and, hermas, fell, outside, the, four, subfamilies, it, was, suggested, that, they, could, be, accommodated, in, subfamilies, of, their, own, phlyctidocarpa, was, formerly, placed, in, the, subfamily, apioideae, but, if, kept, there, makes, apioideae, paraphyletic, it, could, be, placed, in, an, enlarged, saniculoideae, or, restored, to, apioideae, if, the, latter, were, expanded, to, include, saniculoideae, the, subfamilies, can, be, further, divided, into, tribes, and, clades, with, many, clades, falling, outside, formally, recognized, tribes, the, number, of, genera, accepted, by, sources, varies, as, of, december, 2022, plants, of, the, world, online, powo, accepted, 444, genera, while, grin, taxonomy, accepted, 462, the, powo, genera, are, not, a, subset, of, those, in, grin, for, example, haloselinum, is, accepted, by, powo, but, not, by, grin, while, halosciastrum, is, accepted, by, grin, but, not, by, powo, which, treats, it, as, a, synonym, of, angelica, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, website, had, an, approximate, list, of, 446, genera, the, black, swallowtail, butterfly, papilio, polyxenes, uses, the, family, apiaceae, for, food, and, host, plants, for, oviposition, the, 22, spot, ladybird, is, also, commonly, found, eating, mildew, on, these, plants, many, members, of, this, family, are, cultivated, for, various, purposes, some, species, produce, tap, roots, that, are, large, enough, to, be, useful, as, food, other, species, produce, essential, oils, in, their, leaves, or, fruits, and, as, a, result, are, flavourful, aromatic, herbs, the, seeds, of, certain, species, may, be, used, in, cuisine, as, well, other, notable, cultivated, apiaceae, include, chervil, anthriscus, cerefolium, angelica, angelica, spp, celery, apium, graveolens, arracacha, arracacia, xanthorrhiza, sea, holly, eryngium, spp, asafoetida, ferula, asafoetida, galbanum, ferula, gummosa, cicely, myrrhis, odorata, anise, pimpinella, anisum, lovage, levisticum, officinale, and, hacquetia, sanicula, epipactis, generally, all, members, of, this, family, are, best, cultivated, in, the, cool, season, garden, they, may, not, grow, at, all, if, the, soils, are, too, warm, almost, every, widely, cultivated, plant, of, this, group, is, a, considered, useful, as, a, companion, plant, one, reason, is, that, the, tiny, flowers, clustered, into, umbels, are, well, suited, for, ladybugs, parasitic, wasps, and, predatory, flies, which, drink, nectar, when, not, reproducing, they, then, prey, upon, insect, pests, on, nearby, plants, some, of, the, members, of, this, family, considered, herbs, produce, scents, that, are, believed, to, mask, the, odours, of, nearby, plants, thus, making, them, harder, for, insect, pests, to, find, the, poisonous, members, of, the, apiaceae, have, been, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, globally, the, poisonous, oenanthe, crocata, has, been, used, as, an, aid, in, suicides, and, arrow, poisons, have, been, made, from, various, other, family, species, daucus, carota, has, been, used, as, coloring, for, butter, dorema, ammoniacum, ferula, galbaniflua, and, ferula, moschata, sumbul, are, sources, of, incense, the, woody, azorella, compacta, phil, has, been, used, in, south, america, for, fuel, many, species, in, the, family, apiaceae, produce, phototoxic, substances, called, furanocoumarins, that, sensitize, human, skin, to, sunlight, contact, with, plant, parts, that, contain, furanocoumarins, followed, by, exposure, to, sunlight, may, cause, phytophotodermatitis, a, serious, skin, inflammation, phototoxic, species, include, ammi, majus, notobubon, galbanum, the, parsnip, pastinaca, sativa, and, numerous, species, of, the, genus, heracleum, especially, the, giant, hogweed, heracleum, mantegazzianum, of, all, the, plant, species, that, have, been, reported, to, induce, phytophotodermatitis, approximately, half, belong, to, the, family, apiaceae, the, family, apiaceae, also, includes, a, smaller, number, of, poisonous, species, including, poison, hemlock, water, hemlock, spotted, cowbane, fool, s, parsley, and, various, species, of, water, dropwort, some, members, of, the, family, apiaceae, including, carrot, celery, fennel, parsley, and, parsnip, contain, polyynes, an, unusual, class, of, organic, compounds, that, exhibit, cytotoxic, effects
