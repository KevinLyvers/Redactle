caecilians, s, s, l, i, n, new, latin, for, blind, ones, are, a, group, of, limbless, vermiform, worm, shaped, or, serpentine, snake, shaped, amphibians, with, small, or, sometimes, nonexistent, eyes, they, mostly, live, hidden, in, soil, or, in, streambeds, and, this, cryptic, lifestyle, renders, caecilians, among, the, least, familiar, amphibians, modern, caecilians, live, in, the, tropics, of, south, and, central, america, africa, and, southern, asia, caecilians, feed, on, small, subterranean, creatures, such, as, earthworms, the, body, is, cylindrical, and, often, darkly, coloured, and, the, skull, is, bullet, shaped, and, strongly, built, caecilian, heads, have, several, unique, adaptations, including, fused, cranial, and, jaw, bones, a, two, part, system, of, jaw, muscles, and, a, chemosensory, tentacle, in, front, of, the, eye, the, skin, is, slimy, and, bears, ringlike, markings, or, grooves, and, may, contain, scales, modern, caecilians, are, a, clade, the, order, gymnophiona, d, m, n, f, a, n, or, apoda, p, d, one, of, the, three, living, amphibian, groups, alongside, anura, frogs, and, urodela, salamanders, gymnophiona, is, a, crown, group, encompassing, all, modern, caecilians, and, all, descendants, of, their, last, common, ancestor, there, are, more, than, 220, living, species, of, caecilian, classified, in, 10, families, gymnophionomorpha, is, a, recently, coined, name, for, the, corresponding, total, group, which, includes, gymnophiona, as, well, as, a, few, extinct, stem, group, caecilians, extinct, amphibians, whose, closest, living, relatives, are, caecilians, but, are, not, descended, from, any, caecilian, some, palaeontologists, have, used, the, name, gymnophiona, for, the, total, group, and, the, old, name, apoda, for, the, crown, group, however, apoda, has, other, even, older, uses, including, as, the, name, of, a, genus, of, butterfly, making, its, use, potentially, confusing, and, best, avoided, gymnophiona, derives, from, the, greek, words, gymnos, ancient, greek, for, naked, and, ophis, ancient, greek, for, snake, as, the, caecilians, were, originally, thought, to, be, related, to, snakes, and, to, lack, scales, the, study, of, caecilian, evolution, is, complicated, by, their, poor, fossil, record, and, specialized, anatomy, genetic, evidence, and, some, anatomical, details, such, as, pedicellate, teeth, support, the, idea, that, frogs, salamanders, and, caecilians, collectively, known, as, lissamphibians, are, each, others, closest, relatives, frogs, and, salamanders, show, many, similarities, to, dissorophoids, a, group, of, extinct, amphibians, in, the, order, temnospondyli, caecilians, are, more, controversial, many, studies, extend, dissorophoid, ancestry, to, caecilians, some, studies, have, instead, argued, that, caecilians, descend, from, extinct, lepospondyl, or, stereospondyl, amphibians, contradicting, evidence, for, lissamphibian, monophyly, common, ancestry, rare, fossils, of, early, gymnophionans, such, as, eocaecilia, and, funcusvermis, have, helped, to, test, the, various, conflicting, hypotheses, for, the, relationships, between, caecilians, and, other, living, and, extinct, amphibians, caecilians, anatomy, is, highly, adapted, for, a, burrowing, lifestyle, in, a, couple, of, species, belonging, to, the, primitive, genus, ichthyophis, vestigial, traces, of, limbs, have, been, found, and, in, typhlonectes, compressicauda, the, presence, of, limb, buds, has, been, observed, during, embryonic, development, remnants, in, an, otherwise, completely, limbless, body, this, makes, the, smaller, species, resemble, worms, while, the, larger, species, like, caecilia, thompsoni, with, lengths, up, to, 1, 5, m, 5, ft, resemble, snakes, their, tails, are, short, or, absent, and, their, cloacae, are, near, the, ends, of, their, bodies, except, for, one, lungless, species, atretochoana, eiselti, all, caecilians, have, lungs, but, also, use, their, skin, or, mouths, for, oxygen, absorption, often, the, left, lung, is, much, smaller, than, the, right, one, an, adaptation, to, body, shape, that, is, also, found, in, snakes, their, trunk, muscles, are, adapted, to, pushing, their, way, through, the, ground, with, the, vertebral, column, and, its, musculature, acting, as, a, piston, inside, the, outer, layer, of, the, body, wall, musculature, which, is, closely, attached, to, the, skin, by, contracting, the, outer, layer, of, muscles, it, squeezes, the, coelom, and, generates, a, strong, hydrostatic, force, that, lengthens, the, body, this, muscle, system, allows, the, animal, to, anchor, its, hind, end, in, position, and, force, the, head, forwards, and, then, pull, the, rest, of, the, body, up, to, reach, it, in, waves, in, water, or, very, loose, mud, caecilians, instead, swim, in, an, eel, like, fashion, caecilians, in, the, family, typhlonectidae, are, aquatic, and, the, largest, of, their, kind, the, representatives, of, this, family, have, a, fleshy, fin, running, along, the, rear, section, of, their, bodies, which, enhances, propulsion, in, water, caecilians, have, small, or, absent, eyes, with, only, a, single, known, class, of, photoreceptors, and, their, vision, is, limited, to, dark, light, perception, unlike, other, modern, amphibians, frogs, and, salamanders, the, skull, is, compact, and, solid, with, few, large, openings, between, plate, like, cranial, bones, the, snout, is, pointed, and, bullet, shaped, used, to, force, their, way, through, soil, or, mud, in, most, species, the, mouth, is, recessed, under, the, head, so, that, the, snout, overhangs, the, mouth, the, bones, in, the, skull, are, reduced, in, number, compared, to, prehistoric, amphibian, species, many, bones, of, the, skull, are, fused, together, the, maxilla, and, palatine, bones, have, fused, into, a, maxillopalatine, in, all, living, caecilians, and, the, nasal, and, premaxilla, bones, fuse, into, a, nasopremaxilla, in, some, families, some, families, can, be, differentiated, by, the, presence, of, absence, of, certain, skull, bones, such, as, the, septomaxillae, prefrontals, an, or, a, postfrontal, like, bone, surrounding, the, orbit, eye, socket, the, braincase, is, encased, in, a, fully, integrated, compound, bone, called, the, os, basale, which, takes, up, most, of, the, rear, and, lower, parts, of, the, skull, in, skulls, viewed, from, above, a, mesethmoid, bone, may, be, visible, in, some, species, wedging, into, the, midline, of, the, skull, roof, all, caecilians, have, a, pair, of, unique, sensory, structures, known, as, tentacles, located, on, either, side, of, the, head, between, the, eyes, and, nostrils, these, are, probably, used, for, a, second, olfactory, capability, in, addition, to, the, normal, sense, of, smell, based, in, the, nose, the, ringed, caecilian, siphonops, annulatus, has, dental, glands, that, may, be, homologous, to, the, venom, glands, of, some, snakes, and, lizards, the, function, of, these, glands, is, unknown, the, middle, ear, consists, of, only, the, stapes, bone, and, the, oval, window, which, transfer, vibrations, into, the, inner, ear, through, a, reentrant, fluid, circuit, as, seen, in, some, reptiles, adults, of, species, within, the, family, scolecomorphidae, lack, both, a, stapes, and, an, oval, window, making, them, the, only, known, amphibians, missing, all, the, components, of, a, middle, ear, apparatus, the, lower, jaw, is, specialized, in, caecilians, gymnophionans, including, extinct, species, have, only, two, components, of, the, jaw, the, pseudodentary, at, the, front, bearing, teeth, and, pseudoangular, at, the, back, bearing, the, jaw, joint, and, muscle, attachments, these, two, components, are, what, remains, following, fusion, between, a, larger, set, of, bones, an, additional, inset, tooth, row, with, up, to, 20, teeth, lies, parallel, to, the, main, marginal, tooth, row, of, the, jaw, all, but, the, most, primitive, caecilians, have, two, sets, of, muscles, for, closing, the, jaw, compared, with, the, single, pair, found, in, other, amphibians, one, set, of, muscles, the, adductors, insert, into, the, upper, edge, of, the, pseudoangular, in, front, of, the, jaw, joint, adductor, muscles, are, commonplace, in, vertebrates, and, close, the, jaw, by, pulling, upwards, and, forwards, a, more, unique, set, of, muscles, the, abductors, insert, into, the, rear, edge, of, the, pseudoangular, below, and, behind, the, jaw, joint, they, close, the, jaw, by, pulling, backwards, and, downwards, jaw, muscles, are, more, highly, developed, in, the, most, efficient, burrowers, among, the, caecilians, and, appear, to, help, keep, the, skull, and, jaw, rigid, their, skin, is, smooth, and, usually, dark, but, some, species, have, colourful, skins, inside, the, skin, are, calcite, scales, because, of, these, scales, the, caecilians, were, once, thought, to, be, related, to, the, fossil, stegocephalia, but, they, are, now, believed, to, be, a, secondary, development, and, the, two, groups, are, most, likely, unrelated, scales, are, absent, in, the, families, scolecomorphidae, and, typhlonectidae, except, the, species, typhlonectes, compressicauda, where, minute, scales, have, been, found, in, the, hinder, region, of, the, body, the, skin, also, has, numerous, ring, shaped, folds, or, annuli, that, partially, encircle, the, body, giving, them, a, segmented, appearance, like, some, other, living, amphibians, the, skin, contains, glands, that, secrete, a, toxin, to, deter, predators, the, skin, secretions, of, siphonops, paulensis, have, been, shown, to, have, hemolytic, properties, recent, research, as, documented, in, the, journal, science, has, shed, light, on, the, behavior, of, certain, species, of, caecilians, these, studies, reveal, that, some, caecilians, exhibit, a, phenomenon, wherein, they, provide, their, hatchlings, with, a, nutrient, rich, substance, akin, to, milk, delivered, through, a, maternal, vent, among, the, species, investigated, the, oviparous, nonmammalian, caecilian, amphibian, siphonops, annulatus, stood, out, indicating, that, the, practice, of, lactation, may, be, more, widespread, among, these, creatures, than, previously, thought, as, detailed, in, a, 2024, study, researchers, collected, 16, mothers, of, the, siphonops, annulatus, species, from, cacao, plantations, in, brazil, s, atlantic, forest, and, filmed, them, with, their, altricial, hatchlings, in, the, lab, the, mothers, remained, with, their, offspring, which, suckled, on, a, white, viscous, liquid, from, their, cloaca, experiencing, rapid, growth, in, their, first, week, this, milk, like, substance, rich, in, fats, and, carbohydrates, is, produced, in, the, mother, s, oviduct, epithelium, s, hypertrophied, glands, similar, to, mammal, milk, the, substance, was, released, seemingly, in, response, to, tactile, and, acoustic, stimulation, by, the, babies, the, researchers, observed, the, hatchlings, emitting, high, pitched, clicking, sounds, as, they, approached, their, mothers, for, milk, a, behavior, unique, among, amphibians, this, milk, feeding, behavior, may, contribute, to, the, development, of, the, hatchlings, microbiome, and, immune, system, similar, to, mammalian, young, the, presence, of, milk, production, in, caecilians, that, lay, eggs, suggests, an, evolutionary, transition, between, egg, laying, and, live, birth, caecilians, are, native, to, wet, tropical, regions, of, southeast, asia, india, bangladesh, nepal, and, sri, lanka, parts, of, east, and, west, africa, the, seychelles, islands, in, the, indian, ocean, central, america, and, in, northern, and, eastern, south, america, in, africa, caecilians, are, found, from, guinea, bissau, geotrypetes, to, southern, malawi, scolecomorphus, with, an, unconfirmed, record, from, eastern, zimbabwe, they, have, not, been, recorded, from, the, extensive, areas, of, tropical, forest, in, central, africa, in, south, america, they, extend, through, subtropical, eastern, brazil, well, into, temperate, northern, argentina, they, can, be, seen, as, far, south, as, buenos, aires, when, they, are, carried, by, the, flood, waters, of, the, paran, river, coming, from, farther, north, their, american, range, extends, north, to, southern, mexico, the, northernmost, distribution, is, of, the, species, ichthyophis, sikkimensis, of, northern, india, ichthyophis, is, also, found, in, south, china, and, northern, vietnam, in, southeast, asia, they, are, found, as, far, east, as, java, borneo, and, the, southern, philippines, but, they, have, not, crossed, wallace, s, line, and, are, not, present, in, australia, or, nearby, islands, there, are, no, known, caecilians, in, madagascar, but, their, presence, in, the, seychelles, and, india, has, led, to, speculation, on, the, presence, of, undiscovered, extinct, or, extant, caecilians, there, in, 2021, a, live, specimen, of, typhlonectes, natans, a, caecilian, native, to, colombia, and, venezuela, was, collected, from, a, drainage, canal, in, south, florida, it, was, the, only, caecilian, ever, reported, in, the, wild, in, the, united, states, and, is, considered, to, be, an, introduction, perhaps, from, the, wildlife, trade, whether, a, breeding, population, has, been, established, in, the, area, is, unknown, the, name, caecilian, derives, from, the, latin, word, caecus, meaning, blind, referring, to, the, small, or, sometimes, nonexistent, eyes, the, name, dates, back, to, the, taxonomic, name, of, the, first, species, described, by, carl, linnaeus, which, he, named, caecilia, tentaculata, there, has, historically, been, disagreement, over, the, use, of, the, two, primary, scientific, names, for, caecilians, apoda, and, gymnophiona, some, palaeontologists, prefer, to, use, the, name, apoda, to, refer, to, the, crown, group, that, is, the, group, containing, all, modern, caecilians, and, extinct, members, of, these, modern, lineages, and, the, name, gymnophiona, to, refer, to, the, total, group, that, is, all, caecilians, and, caecilian, like, amphibians, that, are, more, closely, related, to, modern, groups, than, to, frogs, or, salamanders, however, apoda, been, used, for, groups, of, fishes, and, of, sea, cucumbers, and, is, the, name, of, a, genus, of, moth, and, its, continued, use, in, caecilian, taxonomy, is, potentially, confusing, and, unhelpful, a, classification, of, caecilians, by, wilkinson, et, al, 2011, divided, the, living, caecilians, into, 9, families, containing, nearly, 200, species, in, 2012, a, tenth, caecilian, family, was, newly, described, chikilidae, this, classification, is, based, on, a, thorough, definition, of, monophyly, based, on, morphological, and, molecular, evidence, and, it, solves, the, longstanding, problems, of, paraphyly, of, the, caeciliidae, in, previous, classifications, without, an, exclusive, reliance, upon, synonymy, there, are, 219, species, of, caecilian, in, 33, genera, and, 10, families, the, most, recent, phylogeny, of, caecilians, is, based, on, molecular, mitogenomic, evidence, examined, by, san, mauro, et, al, 2014, and, modified, to, include, some, more, recently, described, genera, such, as, amazops, eocaecilia, micropodia, rubricacaecilia, monbaroni, amazops, rhinatrema, epicrionops, uraeotyphlus, ichthyophis, crotaphatrema, scolecomorphus, chikila, herpele, boulengerula, atretochoana, nectocaecilia, potamotyphlus, chthonerpeton, typhlonectes, oscaecilia, caecilia, idiocranium, indotyphlus, sylvacaecilia, gegeneophis, hypogeophis, praslinia, grandisonia, geotrypetes, schistometopum, gymnopis, dermophis, brasilotyphlus, microcaecilia, mimosiphonops, luetkenotyphlus, siphonops, little, is, known, of, the, evolutionary, history, of, the, caecilians, which, have, left, a, very, sparse, fossil, record, the, first, fossil, a, vertebra, dated, to, the, paleocene, was, not, discovered, until, 1972, other, vertebrae, which, have, characteristic, features, unique, to, modern, species, were, later, found, in, paleocene, and, late, cretaceous, cenomanian, sediments, phylogenetic, evidence, suggests, that, the, ancestors, of, caecilians, and, batrachians, including, frogs, and, salamanders, diverged, from, one, another, during, the, carboniferous, this, leaves, a, gap, of, more, than, 70, million, years, between, the, presumed, origins, of, caecilians, and, the, earliest, definitive, fossils, of, stem, caecilians, prior, to, 2023, the, earliest, fossil, attributed, to, a, stem, caecilian, an, amphibian, closer, to, caecilians, than, to, frogs, or, salamanders, but, not, a, member, of, the, extant, caecilian, lineage, comes, from, the, jurassic, period, this, primitive, genus, eocaecilia, had, small, limbs, and, well, developed, eyes, in, their, 2008, description, of, the, early, permian, amphibian, gerobatrachus, anderson, and, co, authors, suggested, that, caecilians, arose, from, the, lepospondyl, group, of, ancestral, tetrapods, and, may, be, more, closely, related, to, amniotes, than, to, frogs, and, salamanders, which, arose, from, temnospondyl, ancestors, numerous, groups, of, lepospondyls, evolved, reduced, limbs, elongated, bodies, and, burrowing, behaviors, and, morphological, studies, on, permian, and, carboniferous, lepospondyls, have, placed, the, early, caecilian, eocaecilia, among, these, groups, divergent, origins, of, caecilians, and, other, extant, amphibians, may, help, explain, the, slight, discrepancy, between, fossil, dates, for, the, origins, of, modern, amphibia, which, suggest, permian, origins, and, the, earlier, dates, in, the, carboniferous, predicted, by, some, molecular, clock, studies, of, dna, sequences, most, morphological, and, molecular, studies, of, extant, amphibians, however, support, monophyly, for, caecilians, frogs, and, salamanders, and, the, most, recent, molecular, study, based, on, multi, locus, data, suggest, a, late, carboniferous, early, permian, origin, of, extant, amphibians, chinlestegophis, a, stereospondyl, temnospondyl, from, the, late, triassic, chinle, formation, of, colorado, was, proposed, to, be, a, stem, caecilian, in, a, 2017, paper, by, pardo, and, co, authors, if, confirmed, this, would, bolster, the, proposed, pre, triassic, origin, of, lissamphibia, suggested, by, molecular, clocks, it, would, fill, a, gap, in, the, fossil, record, of, early, caecilians, and, suggest, that, stereospondyls, as, a, whole, qualify, as, stem, group, caecilians, however, affinities, between, chinlestegophis, and, gymnophionans, have, been, disputed, along, several, lines, of, evidence, a, 2020, study, questioned, the, choice, of, characters, supporting, the, relationship, and, a, 2019, reanalysis, of, the, original, data, matrix, found, that, other, equally, parsimonious, positions, were, supported, for, the, placement, of, chinlestegophis, and, gymnophionans, among, tetrapods, in, 2024, chinlestegophis, was, consistently, recovered, as, a, sister, taxon, of, rileymillerus, within, various, positions, of, stereospondyli, outside, lissamphibia, based, on, phylogenetic, analyses, and, revisions, a, 2023, paper, by, kligman, and, co, authors, described, funcusvermis, another, amphibian, from, the, chinle, formation, of, arizona, funcusvermis, was, strongly, supported, as, a, stem, group, caecilian, based, on, traits, of, its, numerous, skull, and, jaw, fragments, the, largest, sample, of, caecilian, fossils, known, the, paper, discussed, the, various, hypotheses, for, caecilian, origins, the, polyphyly, hypothesis, caecilians, as, lepospondyls, and, other, lissamphibians, as, temnospondyls, the, lepospondyl, hypothesis, lissamphibians, as, lepospondyls, and, the, newer, hypothesis, supported, by, chinlestegophis, where, caecilians, and, other, lissamphibians, had, separate, origins, within, temnospondyls, nevertheless, all, of, these, ideas, were, refuted, and, the, most, strongly, supported, hypothesis, combined, lissamphibians, into, a, monophyletic, group, of, dissorophoid, temnospondyls, closely, related, to, gerobatrachus, caecilians, are, the, only, order, of, amphibians, to, use, internal, insemination, exclusively, although, most, salamanders, have, internal, fertilization, and, the, tailed, frog, in, the, us, uses, a, tail, like, appendage, for, internal, insemination, in, its, fast, flowing, water, environment, the, male, caecilians, have, a, long, tube, like, intromittent, organ, the, phallodeum, which, is, inserted, into, the, cloaca, of, the, female, for, two, to, three, hours, about, 25, of, the, species, are, oviparous, egg, laying, the, eggs, are, laid, in, terrestrial, nests, rather, than, in, water, and, are, guarded, by, the, female, for, some, species, the, young, caecilians, are, already, metamorphosed, when, they, hatch, others, hatch, as, larvae, the, larvae, are, not, fully, aquatic, but, spend, the, daytime, in, the, soil, near, the, water, about, 75, of, caecilians, are, viviparous, meaning, they, give, birth, to, already, developed, offspring, the, foetus, is, fed, inside, the, female, with, cells, lining, the, oviduct, which, they, eat, with, special, scraping, teeth, some, larvae, such, as, those, of, typhlonectes, are, born, with, enormous, external, gills, which, are, shed, almost, immediately, the, egg, laying, herpelid, species, boulengerula, taitana, feeds, its, young, by, developing, an, outer, layer, of, skin, high, in, fat, and, other, nutrients, which, the, young, peel, off, with, modified, teeth, this, allows, them, to, grow, by, up, to, 10, times, their, own, weight, in, a, week, the, skin, is, consumed, every, three, days, the, time, it, takes, for, a, new, layer, to, grow, and, the, young, have, only, been, observed, to, eat, it, at, night, it, was, formerly, thought, that, the, juveniles, subsisted, only, on, a, liquid, secretion, from, their, mothers, this, form, of, parental, care, known, as, maternal, dermatophagy, has, also, been, reported, in, two, species, in, the, family, siphonopidae, siphonops, annulatus, and, microcaecilia, dermatophaga, siphonopids, and, herpelids, are, not, closely, related, to, each, other, having, diverged, in, the, cretaceous, period, the, presence, of, maternal, dermatophagy, in, both, families, suggest, that, it, may, be, more, widespread, among, caecilians, than, previously, considered, herpele, squalostoma, caecilians, vertically, transmit, the, mother, s, microbiome, to, their, offspring, through, maternal, dermatophagy, in, comparison, to, other, amphibians, the, extended, parenting, of, caecilians, can, provide, beneficial, bacteria, and, fungi, but, this, transmission, risks, the, spread, of, diseases, like, chytridiomycosis, caecilians, are, considered, as, generalist, predators, while, caecilians, are, generally, carnivorous, their, diet, differs, between, taxa, the, stomach, contents, of, wild, caecilians, include, primarily, soil, ecosystem, engineers, like, earthworms, termites, lizards, moth, larvae, and, shrimp, some, species, of, caecilians, will, opportunistically, consume, newborn, rodents, salmon, eggs, and, veal, in, laboratory, conditions, as, well, as, vertebrates, such, as, scolecophidian, snakes, lizards, small, fishes, and, frogs, as, caecilians, are, a, reclusive, group, they, are, only, featured, in, a, few, human, myths, and, are, generally, considered, repulsive, in, traditional, customs, in, the, folklore, of, certain, regions, of, india, caecilians, are, feared, and, reviled, based, on, the, belief, that, they, are, fatally, venomous, caecilians, in, the, eastern, himalayas, are, colloquially, known, as, back, ache, snakes, while, in, the, western, ghats, ichthyophis, tricolor, is, considered, to, be, more, toxic, than, a, king, cobra, despite, deep, cultural, respect, for, the, cobra, and, other, dangerous, animals, the, caecilian, is, killed, on, sight, by, salt, and, kerosene, these, myths, have, complicated, conservation, initiatives, for, indian, caecilians, crotaphatrema, lamottei, a, rare, species, native, to, mount, oku, in, cameroon, is, classified, as, a, kefa, ntie, burrowing, creature, by, the, oku, kefa, ntie, a, term, also, encompassing, native, moles, and, blind, snakes, are, considered, poisonous, causing, painful, sores, if, encountered, contacted, or, killed, according, to, oku, tradition, the, ceremony, to, cleanse, the, affliction,
