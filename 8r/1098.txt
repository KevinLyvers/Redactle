the, soybean, soy, bean, or, soya, bean, glycine, max, is, a, species, of, legume, native, to, east, asia, widely, grown, for, its, edible, bean, which, has, numerous, uses, traditional, unfermented, food, uses, of, soybeans, include, soy, milk, from, which, tofu, and, tofu, skin, are, made, fermented, soy, foods, include, soy, sauce, fermented, bean, paste, natt, and, tempeh, fat, free, defatted, soybean, meal, is, a, significant, and, cheap, source, of, protein, for, animal, feeds, and, many, packaged, meals, for, example, soybean, products, such, as, textured, vegetable, protein, tvp, are, ingredients, in, many, meat, and, dairy, substitutes, soybeans, contain, significant, amounts, of, phytic, acid, dietary, minerals, and, b, vitamins, soy, vegetable, oil, used, in, food, and, industrial, applications, is, another, product, of, processing, the, soybean, crop, soybean, is, the, most, important, protein, source, for, feed, farm, animals, that, in, turn, yields, animal, protein, for, human, consumption, the, word, soy, derives, from, the, japanese, soi, a, regional, variant, of, sh, yu, meaning, soy, sauce, the, name, of, the, genus, glycine, comes, from, linnaeus, when, naming, the, genus, linnaeus, observed, that, one, of, the, species, within, the, genus, had, a, sweet, root, based, on, the, sweetness, the, greek, word, for, sweet, glyk, s, was, latinized, the, genus, name, is, not, related, to, the, amino, acid, glycine, the, genus, glycine, may, be, divided, into, two, subgenera, glycine, and, soja, the, subgenus, soja, includes, the, cultivated, soybean, g, max, and, the, wild, soybean, treated, either, as, a, separate, species, g, soja, or, as, the, subspecies, g, max, subsp, soja, the, cultivated, and, wild, soybeans, are, annuals, the, wild, soybean, is, native, to, china, japan, korea, and, russia, the, subgenus, glycine, consists, of, at, least, 25, wild, perennial, species, for, example, g, canescens, and, g, tomentella, both, found, in, australia, and, papua, new, guinea, perennial, soybean, neonotonia, wightii, belongs, to, a, different, genus, it, originated, in, africa, and, is, now, a, widespread, pasture, crop, in, the, tropics, like, some, other, crops, of, long, domestication, the, relationship, of, the, modern, soybean, to, wild, growing, species, can, no, longer, be, traced, with, any, degree, of, certainty, it, is, a, cultigen, with, a, very, large, number, of, cultivars, like, most, plants, soybeans, grow, in, distinct, morphological, stages, as, they, develop, from, seeds, into, fully, mature, plant, the, first, stage, of, growth, is, germination, a, method, which, first, becomes, apparent, as, a, seed, s, radicle, emerges, this, is, the, first, stage, of, root, growth, and, occurs, within, the, first, 48, hours, under, ideal, growing, conditions, the, first, photosynthetic, structures, the, cotyledons, develop, from, the, hypocotyl, the, first, plant, structure, to, emerge, from, the, soil, these, cotyledons, both, act, as, leaves, and, as, a, source, of, nutrients, for, the, immature, plant, providing, the, seedling, nutrition, for, its, first, 7, to, 10, days, the, first, true, leaves, develop, as, a, pair, of, single, blades, subsequent, to, this, first, pair, mature, nodes, form, compound, leaves, with, three, blades, mature, trifoliolate, leaves, having, three, to, four, leaflets, per, leaf, are, often, between, 6, and, 15, cm, 2, 1, 2, and, 6, in, long, and, 2, and, 7, cm, 1, and, 3, in, broad, under, ideal, conditions, stem, growth, continues, producing, new, nodes, every, four, days, before, flowering, roots, can, grow, 2, cm, 3, 4, in, per, day, if, rhizobia, are, present, root, nodulation, begins, by, the, time, the, third, node, appears, nodulation, typically, continues, for, 8, weeks, before, the, symbiotic, infection, process, stabilizes, the, final, characteristics, of, a, soybean, plant, are, variable, with, factors, such, as, genetics, soil, quality, and, climate, affecting, its, form, however, fully, mature, soybean, plants, are, generally, between, 50, and, 125, cm, 20, and, 50, in, in, height, and, have, rooting, depths, between, 75, and, 150, cm, 30, and, 60, in, flowering, is, triggered, by, day, length, often, beginning, once, days, become, shorter, than, 12, 8, hours, this, trait, is, highly, variable, however, with, different, varieties, reacting, differently, to, changing, day, length, soybeans, form, inconspicuous, self, fertile, flowers, which, are, borne, in, the, axil, of, the, leaf, and, are, white, pink, or, purple, though, they, do, not, require, pollination, they, are, attractive, to, bees, because, they, produce, nectar, that, is, high, in, sugar, content, depending, on, the, soybean, variety, node, growth, may, cease, once, flowering, begins, strains, that, continue, nodal, development, after, flowering, are, termed, indeterminates, and, are, best, suited, to, climates, with, longer, growing, seasons, often, soybeans, drop, their, leaves, before, the, seeds, are, fully, mature, the, fruit, is, a, hairy, pod, that, grows, in, clusters, of, three, to, five, each, pod, is, 3, 8, cm, 1, 3, in, long, and, usually, contains, two, to, four, rarely, more, seeds, 5, 11, mm, in, diameter, soybean, seeds, come, in, a, wide, variety, of, sizes, and, hull, colors, such, as, black, brown, yellow, and, green, variegated, and, bicolored, seed, coats, are, also, common, the, hull, of, the, mature, bean, is, hard, water, resistant, and, protects, the, cotyledon, and, hypocotyl, or, germ, from, damage, if, the, seed, coat, is, cracked, the, seed, will, not, germinate, the, scar, visible, on, the, seed, coat, is, called, the, hilum, colors, include, black, brown, buff, gray, and, yellow, and, at, one, end, of, the, hilum, is, the, micropyle, or, small, opening, in, the, seed, coat, which, can, allow, the, absorption, of, water, for, sprouting, some, seeds, such, as, soybeans, containing, very, high, levels, of, protein, can, undergo, desiccation, yet, survive, and, revive, after, water, absorption, a, carl, leopold, began, studying, this, capability, at, the, boyce, thompson, institute, for, plant, research, at, cornell, university, in, the, mid, 1980s, he, found, soybeans, and, corn, to, have, a, range, of, soluble, carbohydrates, protecting, the, seed, s, cell, viability, patents, were, awarded, to, him, in, the, early, 1990s, on, techniques, for, protecting, biological, membranes, and, proteins, in, the, dry, state, like, many, legumes, soybeans, can, fix, atmospheric, nitrogen, due, to, the, presence, of, symbiotic, bacteria, from, the, rhizobia, group, together, protein, and, soybean, oil, content, account, for, 56, of, dry, soybeans, by, weight, 36,

especially, for, protein, 36, dv, dietary, fiber, 37, iron, 121, manganese, 120, phosphorus, 101, and, several, b, vitamins, including, folate, 94, table, high, contents, also, exist, for, vitamin, k, magnesium, zinc, and, potassium, table, for, human, consumption, soybeans, must, be, processed, prior, to, consumption, either, by, cooking, roasting, or, fermenting, to, destroy, the, trypsin, inhibitors, serine, protease, inhibitors, raw, soybeans, including, the, immature, green, form, are, toxic, to, all, monogastric, animals, most, soy, protein, is, a, relatively, heat, stable, storage, protein, this, heat, stability, enables, soy, food, products, requiring, high, temperature, cooking, such, as, tofu, soy, milk, and, textured, vegetable, protein, soy, flour, to, be, made, soy, protein, is, essentially, identical, to, the, protein, of, other, legume, seeds, and, pulses, soy, is, a, good, source, of, protein, for, vegetarians, and, vegans, or, for, people, who, want, to, reduce, the, amount, of, meat, they, eat, according, to, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, soy, protein, products, can, be, good, substitutes, for, animal, products, because, unlike, some, other, beans, soy, offers, a, complete, protein, profile, soy, protein, products, can, replace, animal, based, foods, which, also, have, complete, proteins, but, tend, to, contain, more, fat, especially, saturated, fat, without, requiring, major, adjustments, elsewhere, in, the, diet, although, soybeans, have, high, protein, content, soybeans, also, contain, high, levels, of, protease, inhibitors, which, can, prevent, digestion, protease, inhibitors, are, reduced, by, cooking, soybeans, and, are, present, in, low, levels, in, soy, products, such, as, tofu, and, soy, milk, the, protein, digestibility, corrected, amino, acid, score, pdcaas, of, soy, protein, is, the, nutritional, equivalent, of, meat, eggs, and, casein, for, human, growth, and, health, soybean, protein, isolate, has, a, biological, value, of, 74, whole, soybeans, 96, soybean, milk, 91, and, eggs, 97, all, spermatophytes, except, for, the, family, of, grasses, and, cereals, poaceae, contain, 7s, vicilin, and, 11s, legumin, soy, protein, like, globulin, storage, proteins, or, only, one, of, these, globulin, proteins, s, denotes, svedberg, sedimentation, coefficients, oats, and, rice, are, anomalous, in, that, they, also, contain, a, majority, of, soybean, like, protein, cocoa, for, example, contains, the, 7s, globulin, which, contributes, to, cocoa, chocolate, taste, and, aroma, whereas, coffee, beans, coffee, grounds, contain, the, 11s, globulin, responsible, for, coffee, s, aroma, and, flavor, vicilin, and, legumin, proteins, belong, to, the, cupin, superfamily, a, large, family, of, functionally, diverse, proteins, that, have, a, common, origin, and, whose, evolution, can, be, followed, from, bacteria, to, eukaryotes, including, animals, and, higher, plants, 2s, albumins, form, a, major, group, of, homologous, storage, proteins, in, many, dicot, species, and, in, some, monocots, but, not, in, grasses, cereals, soybeans, contain, a, small, but, significant, 2s, storage, protein, 2s, albumin, are, grouped, in, the, prolamin, superfamily, other, allergenic, proteins, included, in, this, superfamily, are, the, non, specific, plant, lipid, transfer, proteins, alpha, amylase, inhibitor, trypsin, inhibitors, and, prolamin, storage, proteins, of, cereals, and, grasses, peanuts, for, instance, contain, 20, 2s, albumin, but, only, 6, 7s, globulin, and, 74, 11s, it, is, the, high, 2s, albumin, and, low, 7s, globulin, that, is, responsible, for, the, relatively, low, lysine, content, of, peanut, protein, compared, to, soy, protein, the, principal, soluble, carbohydrates, of, mature, soybeans, are, the, disaccharide, sucrose, range, 2, 5, 8, 2, the, trisaccharide, raffinose, 0, 1, 1, 0, composed, of, one, sucrose, molecule, connected, to, one, molecule, of, galactose, and, the, tetrasaccharide, stachyose, 1, 4, to, 4, 1, composed, of, one, sucrose, connected, to, two, molecules, of, galactose, while, the, oligosaccharides, raffinose, and, stachyose, protect, the, viability, of, the, soybean, seed, from, desiccation, see, above, section, on, physical, characteristics, they, are, not, digestible, sugars, so, contribute, to, flatulence, and, abdominal, discomfort, in, humans, and, other, monogastric, animals, comparable, to, the, disaccharide, trehalose, undigested, oligosaccharides, are, broken, down, in, the, intestine, by, native, microbes, producing, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, hydrogen, and, methane, since, soluble, soy, carbohydrates, are, found, in, the, whey, and, are, broken, down, during, fermentation, soy, concentrate, soy, protein, isolates, tofu, soy, sauce, and, sprouted, soybeans, are, without, flatus, activity, on, the, other, hand, there, may, be, some, beneficial, effects, to, ingesting, oligosaccharides, such, as, raffinose, and, stachyose, namely, encouraging, indigenous, bifidobacteria, in, the, colon, against, putrefactive, bacteria, the, insoluble, carbohydrates, in, soybeans, consist, of, the, complex, polysaccharides, cellulose, hemicellulose, and, pectin, the, majority, of, soybean, carbohydrates, can, be, classed, as, belonging, to, dietary, fiber, raw, soybeans, are, 20, fat, including, saturated, fat, 3, monounsaturated, fat, 4, and, polyunsaturated, fat, mainly, as, linoleic, acid, table, within, soybean, oil, or, the, lipid, portion, of, the, seed, is, contained, four, phytosterols, stigmasterol, sitosterol, campesterol, and, brassicasterol, accounting, for, about, 2, 5, of, the, lipid, fraction, and, which, can, be, converted, into, steroid, hormones, additionally, soybeans, are, a, rich, source, of, sphingolipids, soy, contains, isoflavones, polyphenolic, compounds, produced, by, legumes, including, peanuts, and, chickpeas, isoflavones, are, closely, related, to, flavonoids, found, in, other, plants, vegetables, and, flowers, soy, contains, the, phytoestrogen, coumestans, also, are, found, in, beans, and, split, peas, with, the, best, sources, being, alfalfa, clover, and, soybean, sprouts, coumestrol, an, isoflavone, coumarin, derivative, is, the, only, coumestan, in, foods, saponins, a, class, of, natural, surfactants, soaps, are, sterols, that, are, present, in, small, amounts, in, various, plant, foods, including, soybeans, other, legumes, and, cereals, such, as, oats, the, following, table, shows, the, nutrient, content, of, green, soybean, and, other, major, staple, foods, each, in, respective, raw, form, on, a, dry, weight, basis, to, account, for, their, different, water, contents, raw, soybeans, however, are, not, edible, and, cannot, be, digested, these, must, be, sprouted, or, prepared, and, cooked, for, human, consumption, in, sprouted, and, cooked, form, the, relative, nutritional, and, anti, nutritional, contents, of, each, of, these, grains, is, remarkably, different, from, that, of, raw, form, of, these, grains, reported, in, this, table, the, nutritional, value,

oil, during, the, war, the, soybean, was, discovered, as, fertilizer, due, to, nitrogen, fixation, by, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, cultivation, is, successful, in, climates, with, hot, summers, with, optimum, growing, conditions, in, mean, temperatures, of, 20, to, 30, c, 70, to, 85, f, temperatures, of, below, 20, c, 70, f, and, over, 40, c, 105, f, stunt, growth, significantly, they, can, grow, in, a, wide, range, of, soils, with, optimum, growth, in, moist, alluvial, soils, with, good, organic, content, soybeans, like, most, legumes, perform, nitrogen, fixation, by, establishing, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, the, bacterium, bradyrhizobium, japonicum, syn, rhizobium, japonicum, jordan, 1982, this, ability, to, fix, nitrogen, allows, farmers, to, reduce, nitrogen, fertilizer, use, and, increase, yields, when, growing, other, crops, in, rotation, with, soy, there, may, be, some, trade, offs, however, in, the, long, term, abundance, of, organic, material, in, soils, where, soy, and, other, crops, for, example, corn, are, grown, in, rotation, for, best, results, though, an, inoculum, of, the, correct, strain, of, bacteria, should, be, mixed, with, the, soybean, or, any, legume, seed, before, planting, modern, crop, cultivars, generally, reach, a, height, of, around, 1, m, 3, ft, and, take, 80, 120, days, from, sowing, to, harvesting, soil, scientists, edson, lobato, brazil, andrew, mcclung, u, s, and, alysson, paolinelli, brazil, were, awarded, the, 2006, world, food, prize, for, transforming, the, ecologically, biodiverse, savannah, of, the, cerrado, region, of, brazil, into, highly, productive, cropland, that, could, grow, profitable, soybeans, human, sewage, sludge, can, be, used, as, fertilizer, to, grow, soybeans, soybeans, grown, in, sewage, sludge, likely, contain, elevated, concentrations, of, metals, soybean, plants, are, vulnerable, to, a, wide, range, of, bacterial, diseases, fungal, diseases, viral, diseases, and, parasites, the, primary, bacterial, diseases, include, bacterial, blight, bacterial, pustule, and, downy, mildew, affecting, the, soybean, plant, the, japanese, beetle, popillia, japonica, poses, a, significant, threat, to, agricultural, crops, including, soybeans, due, to, its, voracious, feeding, habits, found, commonly, in, both, urban, and, suburban, areas, these, beetles, are, frequently, observed, in, agricultural, landscapes, where, they, can, cause, considerable, damage, to, crops, like, corn, soybeans, and, various, fruits, soybean, cyst, nematode, scn, is, the, worst, pest, of, soybean, in, the, us, losses, of, 30, or, 40, are, common, even, without, symptoms, the, corn, earworm, moth, and, bollworm, helicoverpa, zea, is, a, common, and, destructive, pest, of, soybean, growth, in, virginia, soybeans, are, consumed, by, whitetail, deer, which, may, damage, soybean, plants, through, feeding, trampling, and, bedding, reducing, crop, yields, by, as, much, as, 15, groundhogs, are, also, a, common, pest, in, soybean, fields, living, in, burrows, underground, and, feeding, nearby, one, den, of, groundhogs, can, consume, a, tenth, to, a, quarter, of, an, acre, of, soybeans, chemical, repellents, or, firearms, are, effective, for, controlling, pests, in, soybean, fields, soybeans, suffer, from, pythium, spinosum, in, arkansas, and, indiana, united, states, and, china, in, japan, and, the, united, states, the, soybean, dwarf, virus, sbdv, causes, a, disease, in, soybeans, and, is, transmitted, by, aphids, resistant, varieties, are, available, in, indian, cultivars, nataraj, et, al, 2020, find, that, anthracnose, caused, by, colletotrichum, truncatum, is, resisted, by, a, combination, of, 2, major, genes, the, vast, majority, of, cultivars, in, the, us, have, soybean, cyst, nematode, resistance, scn, resistance, but, rely, on, only, one, breeding, line, pi, 88788, as, their, sole, source, of, resistance, the, resistance, genes, provided, by, pi, 88788, peking, and, pi, 90763, were, characterized, in, 1997, as, a, result, for, example, in, 2012, only, 18, cultivars, out, of, 807, recommended, by, the, iowa, state, university, extension, had, any, ancestry, outside, of, pi, 88788, by, 2020, the, situation, was, still, about, the, same, of, 849, there, were, 810, with, some, ancestry, from, pi, 88788, 35, from, peking, and, only, 2, from, pi, 89772, on, the, question, of, exclusively, pi, 88788, ancestry, that, number, was, not, available, for, 2020, that, was, speculated, to, be, in, 2012, and, was, clearly, by, 2020, producing, scn, populations, that, are, virulent, on, pi, 88788, in, 2020, world, production, of, soybeans, was, over, 353, million, tonnes, led, by, brazil, and, the, united, states, combined, with, 66, of, the, total, table, production, has, dramatically, increased, across, the, globe, since, the, 1960s, but, particularly, in, south, america, after, a, cultivar, that, grew, well, in, low, latitudes, was, developed, in, the, 1980s, the, rapid, growth, of, the, industry, has, been, primarily, fueled, by, large, increases, in, worldwide, demand, for, meat, products, particularly, in, developing, countries, like, china, which, alone, accounts, for, more, than, 60, of, imports, in, spite, of, the, amazon, soy, moratorium, soy, production, continues, to, play, a, significant, role, in, deforestation, when, its, indirect, impacts, are, taken, into, account, as, land, used, to, grow, soy, continues, to, increase, this, land, either, comes, from, pasture, land, which, increasingly, supplants, forested, areas, or, areas, outside, the, amazon, not, covered, by, the, moratorium, such, as, the, cerrado, region, roughly, one, fifth, of, deforestation, can, be, attributed, to, expanding, land, use, to, produce, oilseeds, primarily, for, soy, and, palm, oil, whereas, the, expansion, of, beef, production, accounts, for, 41, the, main, driver, of, deforestation, is, the, global, demand, for, meat, which, in, turn, requires, huge, tracts, of, land, to, grow, feed, crops, for, livestock, around, 80, of, the, global, soybean, crop, is, used, to, feed, livestock, soybeans, were, a, crucial, crop, in, east, asia, long, before, written, records, began, the, origin, of, soy, bean, cultivation, remains, scientifically, debated, the, closest, living, relative, of, the, soybean, is, glycine, soja, previously, called, g, ussuriensis, a, legume, native, to, central, china, there, is, evidence, for, soybean, domestication, between, 7000, and, 6600, bc, in, china, between, 5000, and, 3000, bc, in, japan, and, 1000, bc, in, korea, the, first, unambiguously, domesticated, cultigen, sized, soybean, was, discovered, in, korea, at, the, mumun, period, daundong, site, prior, to, fermented, products, such, as, fermented, black, soybeans, douchi, jiang, chinese, miso, soy, sauce, tempeh, natt, and, miso, soy, was, considered, sacred, for, its, beneficial, effects, in, crop, rotation, and, it, was, eaten, by, itself, and, as, bean, curd, and, soy, milk, soybeans, were, introduced, to, java, in, malay, archipelago, circa, 13th, century, or, probably, earlier, by, the, 17th, century, through, their, trade, with, far, east, soybeans, and, its, products, were, traded, by, european, traders, portuguese, spanish, and, dutch, in, asia, and, reached, indian, subcontinent, by, this, period, by, the, 18th, century, soybeans, were, introduced, to, the, americas, and, europe, from, china, soy, was, introduced, to, africa, from, china, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, is, now, widespread, across, the, continent, the, cultivation, of, soybeans, began, in, the, eastern, half, of, northern, china, by, 2000, bc, but, is, almost, certainly, much, older, the, earliest, documented, evidence, for, the, use, of, glycine, of, any, kind, comes, from, charred, plant, remains, of, wild, soybean, recovered, from, jiahu, in, henan, province, china, a, neolithic, site, occupied, between, 9000, and, 7800, calendar, years, ago, cal, bp, an, abundance, of, archeological, charred, soybean, specimens, have, been, found, centered, around, this, region, according, to, the, ancient, chinese, myth, in, 2853, bc, the, legendary, emperor, shennong, of, china, proclaimed, that, five, plants, were, sacred, soybeans, rice, wheat, barley, and, millet, early, chinese, records, mention, that, soybeans, were, a, gift, from, the, region, of, yangtze, river, delta, and, southeast, china, the, great, soviet, encyclopedia, claims, soybean, cultivation, originated, in, china, about, 5000, years, ago, some, scholars, suggest, that, soybean, originated, in, china, and, was, domesticated, about, 3500, bc, recent, research, however, indicates, that, seeding, of, wild, forms, started, early, before, 5000, bc, in, multiple, locations, throughout, east, asia, soybeans, became, an, important, crop, by, the, zhou, dynasty, c, 1046, 256, bc, in, china, however, the, details, of, where, when, and, under, what, circumstances, soybean, developed, a, close, relationship, with, people, are, poorly, understood, soybean, was, unknown, in, south, china, before, the, han, period, from, about, the, first, century, ad, to, the, age, of, discovery, 15, 16th, centuries, soybeans, were, introduced, into, across, south, and, southeast, asia, this, spread, was, due, to, the, establishment, of, sea, and, land, trade, routes, the, earliest, japanese, textual, reference, to, the, soybean, is, in, the, classic, kojiki, records, of, ancient, matters, which, was, completed, in, ad, 712, the, oldest, preserved, soybeans, resembling, modern, varieties, in, size, and, shape, were, found, in, archaeological, sites, in, korea, dated, about, 1000, bc, radiocarbon, dating, of, soybean, samples, recovered, through, flotation, during, excavations, at, the, early, mumun, period, okbang, site, in, korea, indicated, soybean, was, cultivated, as, a, food, crop, in, around, 1000, 900, bc, soybeans, from, the, j, mon, period, in, japan, from, 3000, bc, are, also, significantly, larger, than, wild, varieties, soybeans, were, mentioned, as, kad, l, modern, indonesian, term, kedelai, in, an, old, javanese, manuscript, serat, sri, tanjung, which, dates, to, 12th, to, 13th, century, java, by, the, 13th, century, the, soybean, had, arrived, and, cultivated, in, indonesia, it, probably, arrived, much, earlier, however, carried, by, traders, or, merchants, from, southern, china, the, earliest, known, reference, to, it, as, tempeh, appeared, in, 1815, in, the, serat, centhini, manuscript, the, development, of, tempeh, fermented, soybean, cake, probably, took, place, earlier, circa, 17th, century, in, java, by, the, 1600s, soy, sauce, spread, from, southern, japan, across, the, region, through, the, dutch, east, india, company, voc, the, soybean, probably, arrived, from, southern, china, moving, southwest, into, northern, parts, of, indian, subcontinent, by, this, period, in, 1603, vocabvlario, da, lingoa, de, iapam, a, famous, japanese, portuguese, dictionary, was, compiled, and, published, by, jesuit, priests, in, nagasaki, it, contains, short, but, clear, definitions, for, about, 20, words, related, to, soyfoods, the, first, in, any, european, language, the, luso, hispanic, traders, were, familiar, with, soybeans, and, soybean, product, through, their, trade, with, far, east, since, at, least, the, 17th, century, however, it, was, not, until, the, late, 19th, century, that, the, first, attempt, to, cultivate, soybeans, in, the, iberian, peninsula, was, undertaken, in, 1880, the, soybean, was, first, cultivated, in, portugal, in, the, botanical, gardens, at, coimbra, crespi, 1935, in, about, 1910, in, spain, the, first, attempts, at, soybean, cultivation, were, made, by, the, count, of, san, bernardo, who, cultivated, soybeans, on, his, estates, at, almillo, in, southwest, spain, about, 48, miles, east, northeast, of, seville, soybeans, were, first, introduced, to, north, america, from, china, in, 1765, by, samuel, bowen, a, former, east, india, company, sailor, who, had, visited, china, in, conjunction, with, james, flint, the, first, englishman, legally, permitted, by, the, chinese, authorities, to, learn, chinese, the, first, new, world, soybean, crop, was, grown, on, skidaway, island, georgia, in, 1765, by, henry, yonge, from, seeds, given, him, by, samuel, bowen, bowen, grew, soy, near, savannah, georgia, possibly, using, funds, from, flint, and, made, soy, sauce, for, sale, to, england, although, soybean, was, introduced, into, north, america, in, 1765, for, the, next, 155, years, the, crop, was, grown, primarily, for, forage, in, 1831, the, first, soy, product, a, few, dozen, india, soy, arrived, in, canada, soybeans, were, probably, first, cultivated, in, canada, by, 1855, and, definitely, in, 1895, at, ontario, agricultural, college, it, was, not, until, lafayette, mendel, and, thomas, burr, osborne, showed, that, the, nutritional, value, of, soybean, seeds, could, be, increased, by, cooking, moisture, or, heat, that, soy, went, from, a, farm, animal, feed, to, a, human, food, william, morse, is, considered, the, father, of, modern, soybean, agriculture, in, america, in, 1910, he, and, charles, piper, dr, c, v, piper, began, to, popularize, what, was, regarded, as, a, relatively, unknown, oriental, peasant, crop, in, america, into, a, golden, bean, with, the, soybean, becoming, one, of, america, s, largest, and, most, nutritious, farm, crops, prior, to, the, 1920s, in, the, us, the, soybean, was, mainly, a, forage, crop, a, source, of, oil, meal, for, feed, and, industrial, products, with, very, little, used, as, food, however, it, took, on, an, important, role, after, world, war, i, during, the, great, depression, the, drought, stricken, dust, bowl, regions, of, the, united, states, were, able, to, use, soy, to, regenerate, their, soil, because, of, its, nitrogen, fixing, properties, farms, were, increasing, production, to, meet, with, government, demands, and, henry, ford, became, a, promoter, of, soybeans, in, 1931, ford, hired, chemists, robert, boyer, and, frank, calvert, to, produce, artificial, silk, they, succeeded, in, making, a, textile, fiber, of, spun, soy, protein, fibers, hardened, or, tanned, in, a, formaldehyde, bath, which, was, given, the, name, azlon, it, never, reached, the, commercial, market, soybean, oil, was, used, by, ford, in, paint, for, the, automobiles, as, well, as, a, fluid, for, shock, absorbers, prior, to, the, 1970s, asian, americans, and, seventh, day, adventists, were, essentially, the, only, users, of, soy, foods, in, the, united, states, the, soy, foods, movement, began, in, small, pockets, of, the, counterculture, notably, the, tennessee, commune, named, simply, the, farm, but, by, the, mid, 1970s, a, vegetarian, revival, helped, it, gain, momentum, and, even, popular, awareness, through, books, such, as, the, book, of, tofu, although, practically, unseen, in, 1900, by, 2000, soybean, plantings, covered, more, than, 70, million, acres, second, only, to, corn, and, it, became, america, s, largest, cash, crop, in, 2021, 87, 195, 000, acres, were, planted, with, the, largest, acreage, in, the, states, of, illinois, iowa, and, minnesota, the, soybean, arrived, in, the, caribbean, in, the, form, of, soy, sauce, made, by, samuel, bowen, in, savannah, georgia, in, 1767, it, remains, only, a, minor, crop, there, but, its, uses, for, human, food, are, growing, steadily, the, soybean, was, first, cultivated, in, italy, by, 1760, in, the, botanical, garden, of, turin, during, the, 1780s, it, was, grown, in, at, least, three, other, botanical, gardens, in, italy, the, first, soybean, product, soy, oil, arrived, in, anatolia, during, 1909, under, ottoman, empire, the, first, clear, cultivation, occurred, in, 1931, this, was, also, the, first, time, that, soybeans, were, cultivated, in, middle, east, by, 1939, soybeans, were, cultivated, in, greece, wild, soybeans, were, discovered, in, northeastern, australia, in, 1770, by, explorers, banks, and, solander, in, 1804, the, first, soyfood, product, fine, india, soy, was, sold, in, sydney, in, 1879, the, first, domesticated, soybeans, arrived, in, australia, a, gift, of, the, minister, of, the, interior, department, japan, the, soybean, was, first, cultivated, in, france, by, 1779, and, perhaps, as, early, as, 1740, the, two, key, early, people, and, organizations, introducing, the, soybean, to, france, were, the, society, of, acclimatization, starting, in, 1855, and, li, yu, ying, from, 1910, li, started, a, large, tofu, factory, where, the, first, commercial, soyfoods, in, france, were, made, the, soybean, first, arrived, in, africa, via, egypt, in, 1857, soya, meme, baked, soya, is, produced, in, the, village, called, bame, awudome, near, ho, the, capital, of, the, volta, region, of, ghana, by, the, ewe, people, of, southeastern, ghana, and, southern, togo, in, 1873, professor, friedrich, j, haberlandt, first, became, interested, in, soybeans, when, he, obtained, the, seeds, of, 19, soybean, varieties, at, the, vienna, world, exposition, wiener, weltausstellung, he, cultivated, these, seeds, in, vienna, and, soon, began, to, distribute, them, throughout, central, and, western, europe, in, 1875, he, first, grew, the, soybeans, in, vienna, then, in, early, 1876, he, sent, samples, of, seeds, to, seven, cooperators, in, central, europe, who, planted, and, tested, the, seeds, in, the, spring, of, 1876, with, good, or, fairly, good, results, in, each, case, most, of, the, farmers, who, received, seeds, from, him, cultivated, them, then, reported, their, results, starting, in, february, 1876, he, published, these, results, first, in, various, journal, articles, and, finally, in, his, magnum, opus, die, sojabohne, the, soybean, in, 1878, in, northern, europe, lupin, lupine, is, known, as, the, soybean, of, the, north, the, soybean, is, first, in, cultivated, transcaucasia, in, central, asia, in, 1876, by, the, dungans, this, region, has, never, been, important, for, soybean, production, the, first, reliable, reference, to, the, soybean, in, this, region, dates, from, mexico, in, 1877, the, soybean, first, arrived, in, south, america, in, argentina, in, 1882, andrew, mcclung, showed, in, the, early, 1950s, that, with, soil, amendments, the, cerrado, region, of, brazil, would, grow, soybeans, in, june, 1973, when, soybean, futures, markets, mistakenly, portended, a, major, shortage, the, nixon, administration, imposed, an, embargo, on, soybean, exports, it, lasted, only, a, week, but, japanese, buyers, felt, that, they, could, not, rely, on, u, s, supplies, and, the, rival, brazilian, soybean, industry, came, into, existence, this, led, brazil, to, become, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, soybeans, in, 2020, with, 131, million, tons, industrial, soy, production, in, south, america, is, characterized, by, wealthy, management, who, live, far, away, from, the, production, site, which, they, manage, remotely, in, brazil, these, managers, depend, heavily, on, advanced, technology, and, machinery, and, agronomic, practices, such, as, zero, tillage, high, pesticide, use, and, intense, fertilization, one, contributing, factor, is, the, increased, attention, on, the, brazilian, cerrado, in, bahia, brazil, by, us, farmers, in, the, early, 2000s, this, was, due, to, rising, values, of, scarce, farmland, and, high, production, costs, in, the, us, midwest, there, were, many, promotions, of, the, brazilian, cerrado, by, us, farm, producer, magazines, and, market, consultants, who, portrayed, it, as, having, cheap, land, with, ideal, production, conditions, with, infrastructure, being, the, only, thing, it, was, lacking, these, same, magazines, also, presented, brazilian, soy, as, inevitably, out, competing, american, soy, another, draw, to, investing, was, the, insider, information, about, the, climate, and, market, in, brazil, a, few, dozen, american, farmers, purchased, varying, amounts, of, land, by, a, variety, of, means, including, finding, investors, and, selling, off, land, holdings, many, followed, the, ethanol, company, model, and, formed, an, llc, with, investments, from, neighboring, farmers, friends, and, family, while, some, turned, to, investment, companies, some, soy, farmers, either, liquidated, their, brazilian, assets, or, switched, to, remote, management, from, the, us, to, return, to, farming, there, and, implement, new, farming, and, business, practices, to, make, their, us, farms, more, productive, others, planned, to, sell, their, now, expensive, bahia, land, to, buy, land, cheaper, land, in, the, frontier, regions, of, piau, or, tocantins, to, create, more, soybean, farms, chinese, landraces, were, found, to, have, a, slightly, higher, genetic, diversity, than, inbred, lines, by, li, et, al, 2010, specific, locus, amplified, fragment, sequencing, slaf, seq, has, been, used, by, han, et, al, 2015, to, study, the, genetic, history, of, the, domestication, process, perform, genome, wide, association, studies, gwas, of, agronomically, relevant, traits, and, produce, high, density, linkage, maps, an, snp, array, was, developed, by, song, et, al, 2013, and, has, been, used, for, research, and, breeding, the, same, team, applied, their, array, in, song, et, al, 2015, against, the, usda, soybean, germplasm,

1995, monsanto, company, introduced, glyphosate, tolerant, soybeans, that, have, been, genetically, modified, to, be, resistant, to, monsanto, s, glyphosate, herbicides, through, substitution, of, the, agrobacterium, sp, strain, cp4, gene, epsp, 5, enolpyruvyl, shikimic, acid, 3, phosphate, synthase, the, substituted, version, is, not, sensitive, to, glyphosate, in, 1997, about, 8, of, all, soybeans, cultivated, for, the, commercial, market, in, the, united, states, were, genetically, modified, in, 2010, the, figure, was, 93, as, with, other, glyphosate, tolerant, crops, concern, is, expressed, over, damage, to, biodiversity, a, 2003, study, concluded, the, roundup, ready, rr, gene, had, been, bred, into, so, many, different, soybean, cultivars, there, had, been, little, decline, in, genetic, diversity, but, diversity, was, limited, among, elite, lines, from, some, companies, the, widespread, use, of, such, types, of, gm, soybeans, in, the, americas, has, caused, problems, with, exports, to, some, regions, gm, crops, require, extensive, certification, before, they, can, be, legally, imported, into, the, european, union, where, there, is, considerable, supplier, and, consumer, reluctance, to, use, gm, products, for, consumer, or, animal, use, difficulties, with, coexistence, and, subsequent, traces, of, cross, contamination, of, non, gm, stocks, have, caused, shipments, to, be, rejected, and, have, put, a, premium, on, non, gm, soy, a, 2006, united, states, department, of, agriculture, report, found, the, adoption, of, genetically, engineered, ge, soy, corn, and, cotton, reduced, the, amount, of, pesticides, used, overall, but, did, result, in, a, slightly, greater, amount, of, herbicides, used, for, soy, specifically, the, use, of, ge, soy, was, also, associated, with, greater, conservation, tillage, indirectly, leading, to, better, soil, conservation, as, well, as, increased, income, from, off, farming, sources, due, to, the, greater, ease, with, which, the, crops, can, be, managed, though, the, overall, estimated, benefits, of, the, adoption, of, ge, soybeans, in, the, united, states, was, 310, million, the, majority, of, this, benefit, was, experienced, by, the, companies, selling, the, seeds, 40, followed, by, biotechnology, firms, 28, and, farmers, 20, the, patent, on, glyphosate, tolerant, soybeans, expired, in, 2014, so, benefits, can, be, expected, to, shift, among, the, legumes, the, soybean, is, valued, for, its, high, 38, 45, protein, content, as, well, as, its, high, approximately, 20, oil, content, soybeans, are, the, most, valuable, agricultural, export, of, the, united, states, approximately, 85, of, the, world, s, soybean, crop, is, processed, into, soybean, meal, and, soybean, oil, the, remainder, processed, in, other, ways, or, eaten, whole, soybeans, can, be, broadly, classified, as, vegetable, garden, or, field, oil, types, vegetable, types, cook, more, easily, have, a, mild, nutty, flavor, and, better, texture, are, larger, in, size, higher, in, protein, and, are, lower, in, oil, than, field, types, tofu, soy, milk, and, soy, sauce, are, among, the, top, edible, commodities, made, using, soybeans, producers, prefer, the, higher, protein, cultivars, bred, from, vegetable, soybeans, originally, brought, to, the, united, states, in, the, late, 1930s, the, garden, cultivars, are, generally, not, suitable, for, mechanical, combine, harvesting, because, there, is, a, tendency, for, the, pods, to, shatter, upon, reaching, maturity, soybean, seed, contains, 18, 19, oil, to, extract, soybean, oil, from, seed, the, soybeans, are, cracked, adjusted, for, moisture, content, rolled, into, flakes, and, solvent, extracted, with, commercial, hexane, the, oil, is, then, refined, blended, for, different, applications, and, sometimes, hydrogenated, soybean, oils, both, liquid, and, partially, hydrogenated, are, exported, abroad, sold, as, vegetable, oil, or, end, up, in, a, wide, variety, of, processed, foods, soybean, meal, or, soymeal, is, the, material, remaining, after, solvent, extraction, of, oil, from, soybean, flakes, with, a, 50, soy, protein, content, the, meal, is, toasted, a, misnomer, because, the, heat, treatment, is, with, moist, steam, and, ground, in, a, hammer, mill, ninety, seven, percent, of, soybean, meal, production, globally, is, used, as, livestock, feed, soybean, meal, is, also, used, in, some, dog, foods, one, of, the, major, uses, of, soybeans, globally, is, as, livestock, feed, predominantly, in, the, form, of, soybean, meal, in, the, european, union, for, example, though, it, does, not, make, up, most, of, the, weight, of, livestock, feed, soybean, meal, provides, around, 60, of, the, protein, fed, to, livestock, in, the, united, states, 70, percent, of, soybean, production, is, used, for, animal, feed, with, poultry, being, the, number, one, livestock, sector, of, soybean, consumption, spring, grasses, are, rich, in, omega, 3, fatty, acids, whereas, soy, is, predominantly, omega, 6, the, soybean, hulls, which, mainly, consist, of, the, outer, coats, of, the, beans, removed, before, oil, extraction, can, also, be, fed, to, livestock, and, whole, soybean, seeds, after, processing, in, addition, to, their, use, in, livestock, feed, soybean, products, are, widely, used, for, human, consumption, common, soybean, products, include, soy, sauce, soy, milk, tofu, soy, meal, soy, flour, textured, vegetable, protein, tvp, soy, curls, tempeh, soy, lecithin, and, soybean, oil, soybeans, may, also, be, eaten, with, minimal, processing, for, example, in, the, japanese, food, edamame, edamame, in, which, immature, soybeans, are, boiled, whole, in, their, pods, and, served, with, salt, in, china, japan, vietnam, and, korea, soybean, and, soybean, products, are, a, standard, part, of, the, diet, tofu, d, ufu, is, thought, to, have, originated, in, china, along, with, soy, sauce, and, several, varieties, of, soybean, paste, used, as, seasonings, japanese, foods, made, from, soya, include, miso, natt, kinako, and, edamame, as, well, as, products, made, with, tofu, such, as, atsuage, and, aburaage, in, china, whole, dried, soybeans, are, sold, in, supermarkets, and, used, to, cook, various, dishes, usually, after, rehydration, by, soaking, in, water, they, find, their, use, in, soup, or, as, a, savory, dish, in, korean, cuisine, soybean, sprouts, kongnamul, are, used, in, a, variety, of, dishes, and, soybeans, are, the, base, ingredient, in, doenjang, cheonggukjang, and, ganjang, in,

some, evidence, it, may, lower, the, risk, of, certain, other, cancers, there, is, insufficient, research, to, indicate, whether, taking, soy, dietary, supplements, e, g, as, a, pill, or, capsule, has, any, effect, on, health, or, cancer, risk, as, of, 2018, rigorous, dietary, clinical, research, in, people, with, cancer, has, proved, inconclusive, although, considerable, research, has, examined, the, potential, for, soy, consumption, to, lower, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, in, women, as, of, 2016, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, reach, a, conclusion, about, a, relationship, between, soy, consumption, and, any, effects, on, breast, cancer, a, 2011, meta, analysis, stated, our, study, suggests, soy, isoflavones, intake, is, associated, with, a, significant, reduced, risk, of, breast, cancer, incidence, in, asian, populations, but, not, in, western, populations, reviews, of, preliminary, clinical, trials, on, people, with, colorectal, or, gastrointestinal, cancer, suggest, that, soy, isoflavones, may, have, a, slight, protective, effect, against, such, cancers, a, 2016, review, concluded, that, current, evidence, from, observational, studies, and, small, clinical, trials, is, not, robust, enough, to, understand, whether, soy, protein, or, isoflavone, supplements, may, help, prevent, or, inhibit, the, progression, of, prostate, cancer, a, 2010, review, showed, that, neither, soy, foods, nor, isoflavone, supplements, alter, measures, of, bioavailable, testosterone, or, estrogen, concentrations, in, men, soy, consumption, has, been, shown, to, have, no, effect, on, the, levels, and, quality, of, sperm, meta, analyses, on, the, association, between, soy, consumption, and, prostate, cancer, risk, in, men, concluded, that, dietary, soy, may, lower, the, risk, of, prostate, cancer, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, granted, the, following, health, claim, for, soy, 25, grams, of, soy, protein, a, day, as, part, of, a, diet, low, in, saturated, fat, and, cholesterol, may, reduce, the, risk, of, heart, disease, one, serving, 1, cup, or, 240, ml, of, soy, milk, for, instance, contains, 6, or, 7, grams, of, soy, protein, an, american, heart, association, aha, review, of, a, decade, long, study, of, soy, protein, benefits, did, not, recommend, isoflavone, supplementation, the, review, panel, also, found, that, soy, isoflavones, have, not, been, shown, to, reduce, post, menopausal, hot, flashes, and, the, efficacy, and, safety, of, isoflavones, to, help, prevent, cancers, of, the, breast, uterus, or, prostate, is, in, question, aha, concluded, that, many, soy, products, should, be, beneficial, to, cardiovascular, and, overall, health, because, of, their, high, content, of, polyunsaturated, fats, fiber, vitamins, and, minerals, and, low, content, of, saturated, fat, other, studies, found, that, soy, protein, consumption, could, lower, the, concentration, of, low, density, lipoproteins, ldl, transporting, fats, in, the, extracellular, water, to, cells, allergy, to, soy, is, common, and, the, food, is, listed, with, other, foods, that, commonly, cause, allergy, such, as, milk, eggs, peanuts, tree, nuts, shellfish, the, problem, has, been, reported, among, younger, children, and, the, diagnosis, of, soy, allergy, is, often, based, on, symptoms, reported, by, parents, and, results, of, skin, tests, or, blood, tests, for, allergy, only, a, few, reported, studies, have, attempted, to, confirm, allergy, to, soy, by, direct, challenge, with, the, food, under, controlled, conditions, it, is, very, difficult, to, give, a, reliable, estimate, of, the, true, prevalence, of, soy, allergy, in, the, general, population, to, the, extent, that, it, does, exist, soy, allergy, may, cause, cases, of, urticaria, and, angioedema, usually, within, minutes, to, hours, of, ingestion, in, rare, cases, true, anaphylaxis, may, also, occur, the, reason, for, the, discrepancy, is, likely, that, soy, proteins, the, causative, factor, in, allergy, are, far, less, potent, at, triggering, allergy, symptoms, than, the, proteins, of, peanut, and, shellfish, an, allergy, test, that, is, positive, demonstrates, that, the, immune, system, has, formed, ige, antibodies, to, soy, proteins, however, this, is, only, a, factor, when, soy, proteins, reach, the, blood, without, being, digested, in, sufficient, quantities, to, reach, a, threshold, to, provoke, actual, symptoms, soy, can, also, trigger, symptoms, via, food, intolerance, a, situation, where, no, allergic, mechanism, can, be, proven, one, scenario, is, seen, in, very, young, infants, who, have, vomiting, and, diarrhoea, when, fed, soy, based, formula, which, resolves, when, the, formula, is, withdrawn, older, infants, can, suffer, a, more, severe, disorder, with, vomiting, diarrhoea, that, may, be, bloody, anemia, weight, loss, and, failure, to, thrive, the, most, common, cause, of, this, unusual, disorder, is, a, sensitivity, to, cow, s, milk, but, soy, formulas, can, also, be, the, trigger, the, precise, mechanism, is, unclear, and, it, could, be, immunologic, although, not, through, the, ige, type, antibodies, that, have, the, leading, role, in, urticaria, and, anaphylaxis, however, it, is, also, self, limiting, and, will, often, disappear, in, the, toddler, years, in, the, european, union,
