a, sugar, beet, is, a, plant, whose, root, contains, a, high, concentration, of, sucrose, and, that, is, grown, commercially, for, sugar, production, in, plant, breeding, it, is, known, as, the, altissima, cultivar, group, of, the, common, beet, beta, vulgaris, together, with, other, beet, cultivars, such, as, beetroot, and, chard, it, belongs, to, the, subspecies, beta, vulgaris, subsp, vulgaris, but, classified, as, var, saccharifera, its, closest, wild, relative, is, the, sea, beet, beta, vulgaris, subsp, maritima, sugar, beets, are, grown, in, climates, that, are, too, cold, for, sugarcane, in, 2020, russia, the, united, states, germany, france, and, turkey, were, the, world, s, five, largest, sugar, beet, producers, in, 2010, 2011, europe, and, north, america, except, arctic, territories, failed, to, supply, the, overall, domestic, demand, for, sugar, and, were, all, net, importers, of, sugar, the, us, harvested, 1, 004, 600, acres, 406, 547, ha, of, sugar, beets, in, 2008, in, 2009, sugar, beets, accounted, for, 20, of, the, world, s, sugar, production, and, nearly, 30, by, 2013, sugarcane, accounts, for, most, of, the, rest, of, sugar, produced, globally, in, february, 2015, a, usda, factsheet, reported, that, sugar, beets, generally, account, for, about, 55, percent, of, domestically, produced, sugar, and, sugar, cane, for, about, 45, percent, the, sugar, beet, has, a, conical, white, fleshy, root, a, taproot, with, a, flat, crown, the, plant, consists, of, the, root, and, a, rosette, of, leaves, sugar, is, formed, by, photosynthesis, in, the, leaves, and, is, then, stored, in, the, root, the, root, of, the, beet, contains, 75, water, about, 20, sugar, and, 5, pulp, the, exact, sugar, content, can, vary, between, 12, and, 21, depending, on, the, cultivar, and, growing, conditions, sugar, is, the, primary, value, of, sugar, beet, as, a, cash, crop, the, pulp, insoluble, in, water, and, mainly, composed, of, cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, and, pectin, is, used, in, animal, feed, the, byproducts, of, the, sugar, beet, crop, such, as, pulp, and, molasses, add, another, 10, to, the, value, of, the, harvest, sugar, beets, grow, exclusively, in, the, temperate, zone, in, contrast, to, sugarcane, which, grows, exclusively, in, the, tropical, and, subtropical, zones, the, average, weight, of, a, sugar, beet, ranges, between, 0, 5, and, 1, kg, 1, 1, and, 2, 2, lb, sugar, beet, foliage, has, a, rich, brilliant, green, color, and, grows, to, a, height, of, about, 35, cm, 14, in, the, leaves, are, numerous, and, broad, and, grow, in, a, tuft, from, the, crown, of, the, beet, which, is, usually, level, with, or, just, above, the, ground, surface, the, species, beet, consists, of, several, cultivar, groups, the, 16th, century, french, scientist, olivier, de, serres, discovered, a, process, for, preparing, sugar, syrup, from, red, beetroot, he, wrote, the, beet, root, when, being, boiled, yields, a, juice, similar, to, syrup, of, sugar, which, is, beautiful, to, look, at, on, account, of, its, vermilion, colour, 1575, because, crystallized, cane, sugar, was, already, available, and, had, a, better, taste, this, process, did, not, become, popular, modern, sugar, beets, date, to, the, mid, 18th, century, silesia, where, frederick, the, great, king, of, prussia, subsidized, experiments, to, develop, processes, for, sugar, extraction, in, 1747, andreas, sigismund, marggraf, professor, of, physics, in, the, academy, of, science, of, berlin, isolated, sugar, from, beetroots, and, found, them, at, concentrations, of, 1, 3, 1, 6, he, also, demonstrated, that, the, sugar, that, could, be, extracted, from, beets, was, identical, to, that, produced, from, cane, he, found, the, best, of, these, vegetable, sources, for, sugar, was, the, white, beet, despite, marggraf, s, success, in, isolating, sugar, from, beets, it, did, not, lead, to, commercial, sugar, production, marggraf, s, student, and, successor, franz, karl, achard, began, plant, breeding, sugar, beet, in, kaulsdorf, near, berlin, in, 1786, achard, started, his, plant, breeding, by, evaluating, 23, varieties, of, beet, for, sugar, content, in, the, end, he, selected, a, local, strain, from, halberstadt, in, modern, day, saxony, anhalt, germany, moritz, baron, von, koppy, and, his, son, further, selected, white, conical, tubers, from, this, strain, the, selection, was, named, wei, e, schlesische, zuckerr, be, meaning, white, silesian, sugar, beet, in, about, 1800, this, cultivar, boasted, about, 5, 6, sucrose, by, dry, weight, it, would, go, on, to, be, the, progenitor, of, all, modern, sugar, beets, the, plant, breeding, process, has, continued, since, then, leading, to, a, sucrose, content, of, around, 18, in, modern, varieties, franz, karl, achard, opened, the, world, s, first, beet, sugar, factory, in, 1801, at, kunern, silesia, now, konary, poland, the, idea, to, produce, sugar, from, beet, was, soon, introduced, to, france, whence, the, european, sugar, beet, industry, rapidly, expanded, by, 1840, about, 5, of, the, world, s, sugar, was, derived, from, sugar, beets, and, by, 1880, this, number, had, risen, more, than, tenfold, to, over, 50, in, north, america, the, first, commercial, production, started, in, 1879, at, a, farm, in, alvarado, california, the, sugar, beet, was, introduced, to, chile, by, german, settlers, around, 1850, the, sugar, beet, like, sugarcane, needs, a, particular, soil, and, a, proper, climate, for, its, successful, cultivation, the, most, important, requirements, are, that, the, soil, must, contain, a, large, supply, of, nutrients, be, rich, in, humus, and, be, able, to, contain, a, great, deal, of, moisture, a, certain, amount, of, alkali, is, not, necessarily, detrimental, as, sugar, beets, are, not, especially, susceptible, to, injury, by, some, alkali, the, ground, should, be, fairly, level, and, well, drained, especially, where, irrigation, is, practiced, generous, crops, can, be, grown, in, both, sandy, soil, and, heavy, loams, but, the, ideal, soil, is, a, sandy, loam, i, e, a, mixture, of, organic, matter, clay, and, sand, a, subsoil, of, gravel, or, the, presence, of, hardpan, is, not, desirable, as, cultivation, to, a, depth, of, from, 12, to, 15, inches, 30, to, 38, cm, is, necessary, to, produce, the, best, results, climatic, conditions, temperature, sunshine, rainfall, and, winds, have, an, important, bearing, upon, the, success, of, sugar, beet, agriculture, a, temperature, ranging, from, 15, to, 21, c, 59, to, 70, f, during, the, growing, months, is, most, favorable, in, the, absence, of, adequate, irrigation, 460, mm, 18, inches, of, rainfall, are, necessary, to, raise, an, average, crop, high, winds, are, harmful, as, they, generally, crust, the, land, and, prevent, the, young, beets, from, coming, through, the, ground, the, best, results, are, obtained, along, the, coast, of, southern, california, where, warm, sunny, days, succeeded, by, cool, foggy, nights, seem, to, meet, sugar, beet, s, favored, growth, conditions, sunshine, of, long, duration, but, not, of, great, intensity, is, the, most, important, factor, in, the, successful, cultivation, of, sugar, beets, near, the, equator, the, shorter, days, and, the, greater, heat, of, the, sun, sharply, reduce, the, sugar, content, in, the, beet, in, high, elevation, regions, such, as, those, of, idaho, colorado, and, utah, where, the, temperature, is, high, during, the, daytime, but, where, the, nights, are, cool, the, quality, of, the, sugar, beet, is, excellent, in, michigan, the, long, summer, days, from, the, relatively, high, latitude, the, lower, peninsula, where, production, is, concentrated, lies, between, the, 41st, and, 46th, parallels, north, and, the, influence, of, the, great, lakes, result, in, satisfactory, climatic, conditions, for, sugar, beet, culture, sebewaing, michigan, lies, in, the, thumb, region, of, michigan, both, the, region, and, state, are, major, sugar, beet, producers, sebewaing, is, home, to, one, of, four, michigan, sugar, company, factories, the, town, sponsors, an, annual, michigan, sugar, festival, to, cultivate, beets, successfully, the, land, must, be, properly, prepared, deep, ploughing, is, the, first, principle, of, beet, culture, it, allows, the, roots, to, penetrate, the, subsoil, without, much, obstruction, thereby, preventing, the, beet, from, growing, out, of, the, ground, besides, enabling, it, to, extract, considerable, nourishment, and, moisture, from, the, lower, soil, if, the, latter, is, too, hard, the, roots, will, not, penetrate, it, readily, and, as, a, result, the, plant, will, be, pushed, up, and, out, of, the, earth, during, the, process, of, growth, a, hard, subsoil, is, impervious, to, water, and, prevents, proper, drainage, it, should, not, be, too, loose, however, as, this, allows, the, water, to, pass, through, more, freely, than, is, desirable, ideally, the, soil, should, be, deep, fairly, fine, and, easily, penetrable, by, the, roots, it, should, also, be, capable, of, retaining, moisture, and, at, the, same, time, admit, of, a, free, circulation, of, air, and, good, drainage, sugar, beet, crops, exhaust, the, soil, rapidly, crop, rotation, is, recommended, and, necessary, normally, beets, are, grown, in, the, same, ground, every, third, year, peas, beans, or, grain, being, raised, the, other, two, years, in, most, temperate, climates, beets, are, planted, in, the, spring, and, harvested, in, the, autumn, at, the, northern, end, of, its, range, growing, seasons, as, short, as, 100, days, can, produce, commercially, viable, sugar, beet, crops, in, warmer, climates, such, as, in, california, s, imperial, valley, sugar, beets, are, a, winter, crop, planted, in, the, autumn, and, harvested, in, the, spring, in, recent, years, syngenta, has, developed, the, so, called, tropical, sugar, beet, it, allows, the, plant, to, grow, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, beets, are, planted, from, a, small, seed, 1, kg, 2, 2, lb, of, beet, seed, comprises, 100, 000, seeds, and, will, plant, over, one, hectare, 2, 5, acres, of, ground, one, pound, or, 0, 45, kilograms, will, plant, about, one, acre, or, 0, 40, hectares, until, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, sugar, beet, production, was, highly, labor, intensive, as, weed, control, was, managed, by, densely, planting, the, crop, which, then, had, to, be, manually, thinned, two, or, three, times, with, a, hoe, during, the, growing, season, harvesting, also, required, many, workers, although, the, roots, could, be, lifted, by, a, plough, like, device, that, could, be, pulled, by, a, horse, team, the, rest, of, the, preparation, was, by, hand, one, laborer, grabbed, the, beets, by, their, leaves, knocked, them, together, to, shake, free, loose, soil, and, then, laid, them, in, a, row, root, to, one, side, greens, to, the, other, a, second, worker, equipped, with, a, beet, hook, a, short, handled, tool, between, a, billhook, and, a, sickle, followed, behind, and, would, lift, the, beet, and, swiftly, chop, the, crown, and, leaves, from, the, root, with, a, single, action, working, this, way, he, would, leave, a, row, of, beets, that, could, be, forked, into, the, back, of, a, cart, today, mechanical, sowing, herbicide, application, for, weed, control, and, mechanical, harvesting, have, displaced, this, reliance, on, manual, farm, work, a, root, beater, uses, a, series, of, blades, to, chop, the, leaf, and, crown, which, is, high, in, nonsugar, impurities, from, the, root, the, beet, harvester, lifts, the, root, and, removes, excess, soil, from, the, root, in, a, single, pass, over, the, field, a, modern, harvester, is, typically, able, to, cover, six, rows, at, the, same, time, the, beets, are, dumped, into, trucks, as, the, harvester, rolls, down, the, field, and, then, delivered, to, the, factory, the, conveyor, then, removes, more, soil, if, the, beets, are, to, be, left, for, later, delivery, they, are, formed, into, clamps, straw, bales, are, used, to, shield, the, beets, from, the, weather, provided, the, clamp, is, well, built, with, the, right, amount, of, ventilation, the, beets, do, not, significantly, deteriorate, beets, that, freeze, and, then, defrost, produce, complex, carbohydrates, that, cause, severe, production, problems, in, the, factory, in, the, uk, loads, may, be, hand, examined, at, the, factory, gate, before, being, accepted, in, the, us, the, fall, harvest, begins, with, the, first, hard, frost, which, arrests, photosynthesis, and, the, further, growth, of, the, root, depending, on, the, local, climate, it, may, be, carried, out, over, the, course, of, a, few, weeks, or, be, prolonged, throughout, the, winter, months, the, harvest, and, processing, of, the, beet, is, referred, to, as, the, campaign, reflecting, the, organization, required, to, deliver, the, crop, at, a, steady, rate, to, processing, factories, that, run, 24, hours, a, day, for, the, duration, of, the, harvest, and, processing, for, the, uk, the, campaign, lasts, about, five, months, in, the, netherlands, this, period, is, known, as, de, bietencampagne, a, time, to, be, careful, when, driving, on, local, roads, in, the, area, while, the, beets, are, being, grown, because, the, naturally, high, clay, content, of, the, soil, tends, to, cause, slippery, roads, when, soil, falls, from, the, trailers, during, transport, the, world, harvested, 260, 998, 614, metric, tons, 256, 900, 000, long, tons, 287, 700, 000, short, tons, of, sugar, beets, in, 2022, the, world, s, largest, producer, was, russia, with, a, 48, 907, 753, metric, tons, 48, 100, 000, long, tons, 53, 900, 000, short, tons, harvest, the, average, yield, of, sugar, beet, crops, worldwide, was, 60, 8, tonnes, per, hectare, the, most, productive, sugar, beet, farms, in, the, world, in, 2022, were, in, chile, with, a, nationwide, average, yield, of, 106, 2, tonnes, per, hectare, imperial, valley, california, farmers, have, achieved, yields, of, about, 160, tonnes, per, hectare, and, over, 26, tonnes, sugar, per, hectare, imperial, valley, farms, benefit, from, high, intensities, of, incident, sunlight, and, intensive, use, of, irrigation, and, fertilizers, most, sugar, beet, are, used, to, create, white, sugar, this, is, done, in, a, beet, sugar, factory, often, abbreviated, to, sugar, factory, nowadays, these, most, of, the, time, also, act, as, a, sugar, refinery, but, historically, the, beet, sugar, factory, produced, raw, sugar, and, the, sugar, refinery, refined, raw, sugar, to, create, white, sugar, in, the, 1960s, beet, sugar, processing, was, described, as, consisting, of, these, steps, nowadays, most, sugar, factories, then, refine, the, raw, juice, themselves, without, moving, it, to, a, sugar, refinery, the, beet, pulp, is, processed, on, site, to, become, cattle, fodder, the, next, steps, to, produce, white, sugar, are, not, specific, for, producing, sugar, from, sugar, beet, they, also, apply, to, producing, white, sugar, from, sugar, cane, as, such, they, belong, to, the, sugar, refining, process, not, to, the, beet, sugar, production, process, per, se, there, are, two, obvious, methods, to, produce, alcohol, ethanol, from, sugar, beet, the, first, method, produces, alcohol, as, a, byproduct, of, manufacturing, sugar, it, is, about, fermenting, the, sugar, beet, molasses, that, are, left, after, the, second, centrifugation, this, strongly, resembles, the, manufacture, of, rum, from, sugar, cane, molasses, in, a, number, of, countries, notably, the, czech, republic, and, slovakia, this, analogy, led, to, making, a, rum, like, distilled, spirit, called, tuzemak, on, the, land, islands, a, similar, drink, is, made, under, the, brand, name, kobba, libre, the, second, method, to, produce, alcohol, from, sugar, beet, is, to, ferment, the, sugar, beet, themselves, i, e, without, attempting, to, produce, sugar, the, idea, to, distill, sugar, from, the, beet, came, up, soon, after, the, first, beet, sugar, factory, was, established, between, 1852, and, 1854, champonnois, devised, a, good, system, to, distill, alcohol, from, sugar, beet, within, a, few, years, a, large, sugar, distilling, industry, was, created, in, france, the, current, process, to, produce, alcohol, by, fermenting, and, distilling, sugar, beet, consists, of, these, steps, large, sugar, beet, distilleries, remain, limited, to, europe, in, 2023, tereos, had, 8, beet, sugar, distilleries, located, in, france, czechia, and, romania, in, many, european, countries, rectified, spirit, from, sugar, beet, is, used, to, make, liquor, e, g, vodka, gin, etc, an, unrefined, sugary, syrup, can, be, produced, directly, from, sugar, beet, this, thick, dark, syrup, is, produced, by, cooking, shredded, sugar, beet, for, several, hours, then, pressing, the, resulting, mash, and, concentrating, the, juice, produced, until, it, has, a, consistency, similar, to, that, of, honey, no, other, ingredients, are, used, in, germany, particularly, the, rhineland, area, and, in, the, netherlands, this, sugar, beet, syrup, called, zuckerr, ben, sirup, or, zapp, in, german, or, suikerstroop, in, dutch, is, used, as, a, spread, for, sandwiches, as, well, as, for, sweetening, sauces, cakes, and, desserts, dutch, people, generally, top, their, pancakes, with, stroop, suikerstroop, made, according, to, the, dutch, tradition, is, a, traditional, speciality, guaranteed, under, eu, and, uk, law, commercially, if, the, syrup, has, a, dextrose, equivalency, de, above, 30, the, product, has, to, be, hydrolyzed, and, converted, to, a, high, fructose, syrup, much, like, high, fructose, corn, syrup, or, isoglucose, syrup, in, the, eu, uridine, can, be, isolated, from, sugar, beet, bp, and, associated, british, foods, plan, to, use, agricultural, surpluses, of, sugar, beet, to, produce, biobutanol, in, east, anglia, in, the, united, kingdom, the, feedstock, to, yield, ratio, for, sugarbeet, is, 56, 9, therefore, it, takes, 6, 22, kg, of, sugar, beet, to, produce, 1, kg, of, ethanol, approximately, 1, 27, l, at, room, temperature, in, 2006, it, was, found, that, producing, ethanol, from, sugar, beet, or, cane, became, profitable, when, market, prices, for, ethanol, were, close, to, 4, per, gallon, according, to, atlantic, biomass, president, robert, kozak, a, study, at, university, of, maryland, eastern, shore, indicates, sugar, beets, appear, capable, of, producing, 860, to, 900, gallons, 3, 256, to, 3, 407, liters, of, ethanol, per, acre, in, new, zealand, sugar, beet, is, widely, grown, and, harvested, as, feed, for, dairy, cattle, it, is, regarded, as, superior, to, fodder, beet, because, it, has, a, lower, water, content, resulting, in, better, storage, properties, both, the, beet, bulb, and, the, leaves, with, 25, protein, are, fed, to, cattle, although, long, considered, toxic, to, cattle, harvested, beet, bulbs, can, be, fed, to, cattle, if, they, are, appropriately, transitioned, to, their, new, diet, dairy, cattle, in, new, zealand, can, thrive, on, just, pasture, and, beets, without, silage, or, other, supplementary, feed, the, crop, is, also, now, grown, in, some, parts, of, australia, as, cattle, feed, molasses, can, serve, to, produce, monosodium, glutamate, msg, sugar, beets, are, an, important, part, of, a, crop, rotation, cycle, sugar, beet, plants, are, susceptible, to, rhizomania, root, madness, which, turns, the, bulbous, tap, root, into, many, small, roots, making, the, crop, economically, unprocessable, strict, controls, are, enforced, in, european, countries, to, prevent, the, spread, but, it, is, already, present, in, some, areas, it, is, also, susceptible, to, both, the, beet, leaf, curl, virus, which, causes, crinkling, and, stunting, of, the, leaves, and, beet, yellows, virus, continual, research, looks, for, varieties, with, resistance, as, well, as, increased, sugar, yield, sugar, beet, breeding, research, in, the, united, states, is, most, prominently, conducted, at, various, usda, agricultural, research, stations, including, one, in, fort, collins, colorado, headed, by, linda, hanson, and, leonard, panella, one, in, fargo, north, dakota, headed, by, john, wieland, and, one, at, michigan, state, university, in, east, lansing, michigan, headed, by, rachel, naegele, other, economically, important, members, of, the, subfamily, chenopodioideae, in, the, united, states, genetically, modified, sugar, beets, engineered, for, resistance, to, glyphosate, a, herbicide, marketed, as, roundup, were, developed, by, monsanto, as, a, genetically, modified, crop, in, 2005, the, us, department, of, agriculture, animal, and, plant, health, inspection, service, usda, aphis, deregulated, glyphosate, resistant, sugar, beets, after, it, conducted, an, environmental, assessment, and, determined, glyphosate, resistant, sugar, beets, were, highly, unlikely, to, become, a, plant, pest, sugar, from, glyphosate, resistant, sugar, beets, has, been, approved, for, human, and, animal, consumption, in, multiple, countries, but, commercial, production, of, biotech, beets, has, been, approved, only, in, the, united, states, and, canada, studies, have, concluded, the, sugar, from, glyphosate, resistant, sugar, beets, has, the, same, nutritional, value, as, sugar, from, conventional, sugar, beets, after, deregulation, in, 2005, glyphosate, resistant, sugar, beets, were, extensively, adopted, in, the, united, states, about, 95, of, sugar, beet, acres, in, the, us, were, planted, with, glyphosate, resistant, seed, in, 2011, weeds, may, be, chemically, controlled, using, glyphosate, without, harming, the, crop, after, planting, sugar, beet, seed, weeds, emerge, in, fields, and, growers, apply, glyphosate, to, control, them, glyphosate, is, commonly, used, in, field, crops, because, it, controls, a, broad, spectrum, of, weed, species, and, has, a, low, toxicity, a, study, from, the, uk, suggests, yields, of, genetically, modified, beet, were, greater, than, conventional, while, another, from, the, north, dakota, state, university, extension, service, found, lower, yields, the, introduction, of, glyphosate, resistant, sugar, beets, may, contribute, to, the, growing, number, of, glyphosate, resistant, weeds, so, monsanto, has, developed, a, program, to, encourage, growers, to, use, different, herbicide, modes, of, action, to, control, their, weeds, in, 2008, the, center, for, food, safety, the, sierra, club, the, organic, seed, alliance, and, high, mowing, seeds, filed, a, lawsuit, against, usda, aphis, regarding, their, decision, to, deregulate, glyphosate, resistant, sugar, beets, in, 2005, the, organizations, expressed, concerns, regarding, glyphosate, resistant, sugar, beets, ability, to, potentially, cross, pollinate, with, conventional, sugar, beets, u, s, district, judge, jeffrey, s, white, us, district, court, for, the, northern, district, of, california, revoked, the, deregulation, of, glyphosate, resistant, sugar, beets, and, declared, it, unlawful, for, growers, to, plant, glyphosate, resistant, sugar, beets, in, the, spring, of, 2011, believing, a, sugar, shortage, would, occur, usda, aphis, developed, three, options, in, the, environmental, assessment, to, address, the, concerns, of, environmentalists, in, 2011, a, federal, appeals, court, for, the, northern, district, of, california, in, san, francisco, overturned, the, ruling, in, july, 2012, after, completing, an, environmental, impact, assessment, and, a, plant, pest, risk, assessment, the, usda, deregulated, monsanto, s, roundup, ready, sugar, beets, the, sugar, beet, genome, shares, a, triplication, event, somewhere, super, caryophyllales, and, at, or, sub, eudicots, it, has, been, sequenced, and, two, reference, genome, sequences, have, already, been, generated, the, genome, size, of, the, sugar, beet, is, approximately, 731, 714, 758, megabases, and, sugar, beet, dna, is, packaged, in, 18, metacentric, chromosomes, 2n, 2x, 18, all, sugar, beet, centromeres, are, made, up, of, a, single, satellite, dna, family, and, centromere, specific, ltr, retrotransposons, more, than, 60, of, sugar, beet, s, dna, is, repetitive, mostly, distributed, in, a, dispersed, way, along, the, chromosomes, crop, wild, beet, populations, b, vulgaris, ssp, maritima, have, been, sequenced, as, well, allowing, for, identification, of, the, resistance, gene, rz2, in, the, wild, progenitor, rz2, confers, resistance, to, rhizomania, commonly, known, as, the, sugar, beet, root, madness, disease, sugar, beets, have, been, bred, for, increased, sugar, content, from, 8, to, 18, in, the, 200, years, up, to, 2013, resistance, to, viral, and, fungal, diseases, increased, taproot, size, monogermy, and, less, bolting, breeding, has, been, eased, by, discovery, of, a, cytoplasmic, male, sterility, line, this, has, especially, been, useful,
