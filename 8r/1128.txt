the, globe, artichoke, cynara, cardunculus, var, scolymus, s, n, r, k, r, d, n, k, j, l, s, s, k, l, m, s, also, known, by, the, names, french, artichoke, and, green, artichoke, in, the, united, states, is, a, variety, of, a, species, of, thistle, cultivated, as, food, the, edible, portion, of, the, plant, consists, of, the, flower, buds, before, the, flowers, come, into, bloom, the, budding, artichoke, flower, head, is, a, cluster, of, many, budding, small, flowers, an, inflorescence, together, with, many, bracts, on, an, edible, base, once, the, buds, bloom, the, structure, changes, to, a, coarse, barely, edible, form, another, variety, of, the, same, species, is, the, cardoon, a, perennial, plant, native, to, the, mediterranean, region, both, wild, forms, and, cultivated, varieties, cultivars, exist, this, vegetable, grows, to, 1, 4, 2, m, 4, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, ft, tall, with, arching, deeply, lobed, silvery, glaucous, green, leaves, 50, 83, cm, 19, 1, 2, 32, 1, 2, in, long, the, flowers, develop, in, a, large, head, from, an, edible, bud, about, 8, 15, cm, 3, 6, in, diameter, with, numerous, triangular, scales, the, individual, florets, are, purple, the, edible, portions, of, the, buds, consist, primarily, of, the, fleshy, lower, portions, of, the, involucral, bracts, and, the, base, known, as, the, heart, the, mass, of, immature, florets, in, the, center, of, the, bud, is, called, the, choke, or, beard, which, are, inedible, in, older, larger, flowers, the, english, word, artichoke, was, borrowed, in, the, sixteenth, century, from, the, northern, italian, word, articiocco, the, standard, modern, italian, being, carciofo, the, italian, term, was, itself, borrowed, either, from, spanish, alcarchofa, today, usually, alcachofa, or, directly, from, the, source, of, the, spanish, word, medieval, andalusi, arabic, al, kharsh, fa, including, the, arabic, definite, article, al, the, arabic, form, kharsh, fa, is, still, used, in, maghrebi, arabic, today, while, other, variants, in, arabic, include, kharshafa, and, modern, standard, arabic, khursh, fa, these, arabic, forms, themselves, derive, from, classical, arabic, harshafa, singular, word, of, the, plural, arashef, meaning, scale, other, languages, which, derive, their, word, for, the, artichoke, from, arabic, include, israeli, hebrew, which, has, the, word, khursh, f, the, original, hebrew, name, see, hebrew, he, predating, the, arab, conquest, is, kinars, which, is, found, in, the, mishna, despite, being, borrowed, from, arabic, european, terms, for, the, artichoke, have, in, turn, influenced, arabic, in, their, own, right, for, example, the, modern, levantine, arabic, term, for, artichoke, is, ar, shawk, this, literally, means, earthy, thorny, and, is, an, arabicisation, through, phono, semantic, matching, of, the, english, word, artichoke, or, other, european, terms, like, it, 213, 214, as, in, the, case, of, levantine, arabic, ar, shawk, names, for, the, artichoke, have, frequently, changed, form, due, to, folk, etymology, and, phono, semantic, matching, the, italian, form, articiocco, seems, to, have, been, adapted, to, correspond, to, italian, arci, arch, chief, and, ciocco, stump, forms, of, the, french, word, artichaut, which, also, derives, from, arabic, possibly, via, spanish, have, over, the, years, included, artichaud, corresponding, to, chaud, warm, and, artihault, corresponding, to, haut, height, forms, found, in, english, have, included, hartichoak, corresponding, to, heart, and, choke, which, were, likely, associated, with, the, belief, that, the, inedible, centre, of, the, vegetable, could, choke, its, eaters, or, that, the, plant, can, take, over, a, garden, choking, out, other, plants, artichokes, are, affected, by, fungal, pathogens, including, verticillium, dahliae, and, rhizoctonia, solani, soil, solarization, has, been, successful, in, other, crop, fungus, pathosystems, and, is, evaluated, for, suppression, of, v, dahliae, and, r, solani, by, guerrero, et, al, 2019, the, artichoke, is, a, domesticated, variety, of, the, wild, cardoon, cynara, cardunculus, which, is, native, to, the, mediterranean, area, there, was, debate, over, whether, the, artichoke, was, a, food, among, the, ancient, greeks, and, romans, or, whether, that, cultivar, was, developed, later, with, classical, sources, referring, instead, to, the, wild, cardoon, the, cardoon, is, mentioned, as, a, garden, plant, in, the, eighth, century, bce, by, homer, and, hesiod, pliny, the, elder, mentioned, growing, of, carduus, in, carthage, and, cordoba, in, north, africa, where, it, is, still, found, in, the, wild, state, the, seeds, of, artichokes, probably, cultivated, were, found, during, the, excavation, of, roman, period, mons, claudianus, in, egypt, varieties, of, artichokes, were, cultivated, in, sicily, beginning, in, the, classical, period, of, the, ancient, greeks, the, greeks, calling, them, kaktos, in, that, period, the, greeks, ate, the, leaves, and, flower, heads, which, cultivation, had, already, improved, from, the, wild, form, the, romans, called, the, vegetable, carduus, hence, the, name, cardoon, further, improvement, in, the, cultivated, form, appears, to, have, taken, place, in, the, medieval, period, in, muslim, spain, and, the, maghreb, although, the, evidence, is, inferential, only, by, the, twelfth, century, it, was, being, mentioned, in, the, compendious, guide, to, farming, composed, by, ibn, al, awwam, in, seville, though, it, does, not, appear, in, earlier, major, andalusian, arabic, works, on, agriculture, and, in, germany, by, hildegard, von, bingen, le, roy, ladurie, in, his, book, les, paysans, de, languedoc, has, documented, the, spread, of, artichoke, cultivation, in, italy, and, southern, france, in, the, late, fifteenth, and, early, sixteenth, centuries, when, the, artichoke, appeared, as, a, new, arrival, with, a, new, name, which, may, be, taken, to, indicate, an, arrival, of, an, improved, cultivated, variety, the, blossom, of, the, thistle, improved, by, the, arabs, passed, from, naples, to, florence, in, 1466, carried, by, philippo, strozzi, towards, 1480, it, is, noticed, in, venice, as, a, curiosity, but, very, soon, veers, towards, the, northwest, artichoke, beds, are, mentioned, in, avignon, by, the, notaries, from, 1532, onward, from, the, principal, towns, they, spread, into, the, hinterlands, appearing, as, carchofas, at, cavaillon, in, 1541, at, chateauneuf, du, pape, in, 1553, at, orange, in, 1554, the, local, name, remains, carchofas, from, the, italian, carciofo, they, are, very, small, the, size, of, a, hen, s, egg, and, are, still, considered, a, luxury, a, vaguely, aphrodisiac, tidbit, that, one, preserved, in, sugar, syrup, the, dutch, introduced, artichokes, to, england, where, they, grew, in, henry, viii, s, garden, at, newhall, in, 1530, from, the, mid, 17th, century, artichokes, enjoyed, a, vogue, in, european, courts, the, hearts, were, considered, luxury, ingredients, in, the, new, court, cookery, as, recorded, by, writers, such, as, fran, ois, pierre, la, varenne, the, author, of, le, cuisinier, fran, ois, 1651, it, was, also, claimed, in, this, period, that, artichokes, had, aphrodisiac, properties, they, were, taken, to, the, united, states, in, the, nineteenth, century, to, louisiana, by, french, immigrants, and, to, california, by, spanish, immigrants, cultivation, of, the, globe, artichoke, is, concentrated, in, the, americas, and, the, countries, bordering, the, mediterranean, basin, the, main, european, producers, are, italy, spain, and, france, and, the, main, american, producers, are, argentina, peru, and, the, united, states, in, the, united, states, california, provides, nearly, 100, of, the, u, s, crop, with, about, 80, of, that, being, grown, in, monterey, county, there, castroville, proclaims, itself, to, be, the, artichoke, center, of, the, world, and, holds, the, annual, castroville, artichoke, festival, more, recently, artichokes, have, been, grown, in, south, africa, in, a, small, town, called, parys, located, along, the, vaal, river, in, 2020, the, world, produced, approximately, 1, 5, million, tons, of, artichokes, source, un, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, artichokes, can, be, produced, from, seeds, or, from, vegetative, means, such, as, division, root, cuttings, or, micropropagation, although, technically, perennials, that, normally, produce, the, edible, flower, during, only, the, second, and, subsequent, years, certain, varieties, of, artichokes, can, be, grown, from, seed, as, annuals, producing, a, limited, harvest, at, the, end, of, the, first, growing, season, even, in, regions, where, the, plants, are, not, normally, winter, hardy, this, means, home, gardeners, in, northern, regions, can, attempt, to, produce, a, crop, without, the, need, to, overwinter, plants, with, special, treatment, or, protection, the, seed, cultivar, imperial, star, has, been, bred, to, produce, in, the, first, year, without, such, measures, an, even, newer, cultivar, northern, star, is, said, to, be, able, to, overwinter, in, more, northerly, climates, and, readily, survives, subzero, temperatures, commercial, culture, is, limited, to, warm, areas, in, usda, hardiness, zone, 7, and, above, it, requires, good, soil, regular, watering, and, feeding, and, frost, protection, in, winter, rooted, suckers, can, be, planted, each, year, so, mature, specimens, can, be, disposed, of, after, a, few, years, as, each, individual, plant, lives, only, a, few, years, the, peak, season, for, artichoke, harvesting, is, the, spring, but, they, can, continue, to, be, harvested, throughout, the, summer, with, another, peak, period, in, mid, autumn, when, harvested, they, are, cut, from, the, plant, so, as, to, leave, an, inch, or, two, of, stem, artichokes, possess, good, keeping, qualities, frequently, remaining, quite, fresh, for, two, weeks, or, longer, under, average, retail, conditions, apart, from, culinary, applications, the, globe, artichoke, is, also, an, attractive, plant, for, its, bright,

dv, of, vitamin, k, 16, dv, magnesium, sodium, and, phosphorus, 10, 12, dv, large, globe, artichokes, are, frequently, prepared, by, removing, all, but, 5, 10, mm, 3, 16, 3, 8, in, or, so, of, the, stem, to, remove, thorns, which, may, interfere, with, eating, around, a, quarter, of, each, scale, can, be, cut, off, to, cook, the, artichoke, is, simmered, for, 15, to, 30, minutes, or, steamed, for, 30, 40, minutes, less, for, small, ones, a, cooked, unseasoned, artichoke, has, a, delicate, flavor, salt, may, be, added, to, the, water, if, boiling, artichokes, covered, artichokes, in, particular, those, that, have, been, cut, can, turn, brown, due, to, the, enzymatic, browning, and, chlorophyll, oxidation, placing, them, in, water, slightly, acidified, with, vinegar, or, lemon, juice, can, prevent, the, discoloration, leaves, are, often, removed, one, at, a, time, and, the, fleshy, base, eaten, with, vinaigrette, hollandaise, vinegar, butter, mayonnaise, aioli, lemon, juice, or, other, sauces, the, fibrous, upper, part, of, each, leaf, is, usually, discarded, the, heart, is, eaten, when, the, inedible, choke, has, been, peeled, away, from, the, base, and, discarded, the, thin, leaves, covering, the, choke, are, also, edible, in, italy, artichoke, hearts, in, oil, are, the, usual, vegetable, for, the, spring, section, of, the, four, seasons, pizza, alongside, olives,
