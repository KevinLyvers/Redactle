the, human, urinary, system, also, known, as, the, urinary, tract, or, renal, system, consists, of, the, kidneys, ureters, bladder, and, the, urethra, the, purpose, of, the, urinary, system, is, to, eliminate, waste, from, the, body, regulate, blood, volume, and, blood, pressure, control, levels, of, electrolytes, and, metabolites, and, regulate, blood, ph, the, urinary, tract, is, the, body, s, drainage, system, for, the, eventual, removal, of, urine, the, kidneys, have, an, extensive, blood, supply, via, the, renal, arteries, which, leave, the, kidneys, via, the, renal, vein, each, kidney, consists, of, functional, units, called, nephrons, following, filtration, of, blood, and, further, processing, wastes, in, the, form, of, urine, exit, the, kidney, via, the, ureters, tubes, made, of, smooth, muscle, fibres, that, propel, urine, towards, the, urinary, bladder, where, it, is, stored, and, subsequently, expelled, through, the, urethra, during, urination, the, female, and, male, urinary, system, are, very, similar, differing, only, in, the, length, of, the, urethra, 800, 2, 000, milliliters, ml, of, urine, are, normally, produced, every, day, in, a, healthy, human, this, amount, varies, according, to, fluid, intake, and, kidney, function, the, urinary, system, refers, to, the, structures, that, produce, and, transport, urine, to, the, point, of, excretion, in, the, human, urinary, system, there, are, two, kidneys, that, are, located, between, the, dorsal, body, wall, and, parietal, peritoneum, on, both, the, left, and, right, sides, the, formation, of, urine, begins, within, the, functional, unit, of, the, kidney, the, nephrons, urine, then, flows, through, the, nephrons, through, a, system, of, converging, tubules, called, collecting, ducts, these, collecting, ducts, then, join, together, to, form, the, minor, calyces, followed, by, the, major, calyces, that, ultimately, join, the, renal, pelvis, from, here, urine, continues, its, flow, from, the, renal, pelvis, into, the, ureter, transporting, urine, into, the, urinary, bladder, the, anatomy, of, the, human, urinary, system, differs, between, males, and, females, at, the, level, of, the, urinary, bladder, in, males, the, urethra, begins, at, the, internal, urethral, orifice, in, the, trigone, of, the, bladder, continues, through, the, external, urethral, orifice, and, then, becomes, the, prostatic, membranous, bulbar, and, penile, urethra, urine, exits, the, male, urethra, through, the, urinary, meatus, in, the, glans, penis, the, female, urethra, is, much, shorter, beginning, at, the, bladder, neck, and, terminating, in, the, vulval, vestibule, under, microscopy, the, urinary, system, is, covered, in, a, unique, lining, called, urothelium, a, type, of, transitional, epithelium, unlike, the, epithelial, lining, of, most, organs, transitional, epithelium, can, flatten, and, distend, urothelium, covers, most, of, the, urinary, system, including, the, renal, pelvis, ureters, and, bladder, the, main, functions, of, the, urinary, system, and, its, components, are, to, average, urine, production, in, adult, humans, is, about, 1, 2, litres, l, per, day, depending, on, state, of, hydration, activity, level, environmental, factors, weight, and, the, individual, s, health, producing, too, much, or, too, little, urine, requires, medical, attention, polyuria, is, a, condition, of, excessive, urine, production, 2, 5, l, day, conditions, involving, low, output, of, urine, are, oliguria, 400, ml, day, and, anuria, 100, ml, day, the, first, step, in, urine, formation, is, the, filtration, of, blood, in, the, kidneys, in, a, healthy, human, the, kidney, receives, between, 12, and, 30, of, cardiac, output, but, it, averages, about, 20, or, about, 1, 25, l, min, the, basic, structural, and, functional, unit, of, the, kidney, is, the, nephron, its, chief, function, is, to, regulate, the, concentration, of, water, and, soluble, substances, like, sodium, by, filtering, the, blood, reabsorbing, what, is, needed, and, excreting, the, rest, as, urine, in, the, first, part, of, the, nephron, bowman, s, capsule, filters, blood, from, the, circulatory, system, into, the, tubules, hydrostatic, and, osmotic, pressure, gradients, facilitate, filtration, across, a, semipermeable, membrane, the, filtrate, includes, water, small, molecules, and, ions, that, easily, pass, through, the, filtration, membrane, however, larger, molecules, such, as, proteins, and, blood, cells, are, prevented, from, passing, through, the, filtration, membrane, the, amount, of, filtrate, produced, every, minute, is, called, the, glomerular, filtration, rate, or, gfr, and, amounts, to, 180, litres, per, day, about, 99, of, this, filtrate, is, reabsorbed, as, it, passes, through, the, nephron, and, the, remaining, 1, becomes, urine, the, urinary, system, is, regulated, by, the, endocrine, system, by, hormones, such, as, antidiuretic, hormone, aldosterone, and, parathyroid, hormone, the, urinary, system, is, under, influence, of, the, circulatory, system, nervous, system, and, endocrine, system, aldosterone, plays, a, central, role, in, regulating, blood, pressure, through, its, effects, on, the, kidney, it, acts, on, the, distal, tubules, and, collecting, ducts, of, the, nephron, and, increases, reabsorption, of, sodium, from, the, glomerular, filtrate, reabsorption, of, sodium, results, in, retention, of, water, which, increases, blood, pressure, and, blood, volume, antidiuretic, hormone, adh, is, a, neurohypophysial, hormone, found, in, most, mammals, its, two, primary, functions, are, to, retain, water, in, the, body, and, vasoconstriction, vasopressin, regulates, the, body, s, retention, of, water, by, increasing, water, reabsorption, in, the, collecting, ducts, of, the, kidney, nephron, vasopressin, increases, water, permeability, of, the, kidney, s, collecting, duct, and, distal, convoluted, tubule, by, inducing, translocation, of, aquaporin, cd, water, channels, in, the, kidney, nephron, collecting, duct, plasma, membrane, urination, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, micturition, is, the, ejection, of, urine, from, the, urinary, bladder, to, the, outside, of, the, body, urine, is, ejected, through, the, urethra, from, the, penis, or, vulva, in, placental, mammals, and, through, the, cloaca, in, other, vertebrates, in, healthy, humans, and, many, other, animals, the, process, of, urination, is, under, voluntary, control, in, infants, some, elderly, individuals, and, those, with, neurological, injury, urination, may, occur, as, an, involuntary, reflex, physiologically, micturition, involves, coordination, between, the, central, autonomic, and, somatic, nervous, systems, brain, centers, that, regulate, urination, include, the, pontine, micturition, center, periaqueductal, gray, and, the, cerebral, cortex, urologic, disease, can, involve, congenital, or, acquired, dysfunction, of, the, urinary, system, as, an, example, urinary, tract, obstruction, is, a, urologic, disease, that, can, cause, urinary, retention, diseases, of, the, kidney, tissue, are, normally, treated, by, nephrologists, while, diseases, of, the, urinary, tract, are, treated, by, urologists, gynecologists, may, also, treat, female, urinary, incontinence, diseases, of, other, bodily, systems, also, have, a, direct, effect, on, urogenital, function, for, instance, it, has, been, shown, that, protein, released, by, the, kidneys, in, diabetes, mellitus, sensitizes, the, kidney, to, the, damaging, effects, of, hypertension, diabetes, also, can, have, a, direct, effect, in, urination, due, to, peripheral, neuropathies, which, occur, in, some, individuals, with, poorly, controlled, blood, sugar, levels, urinary, incontinence, can, result, from, a, weakening, of, the, pelvic, floor, muscles, caused, by, factors, such, as, pregnancy, childbirth, aging, and, being, overweight, findings, recent, systematic, reviews, demonstrate, that, behavioral, therapy, generally, results, in, improved, urinary, incontinence, outcomes, especially, for, stress, and, urge, ui, than, medications, alone, pelvic, floor, exercises, known, as, kegel, exercises, can, help, in, this, condition, by, strengthening, the, pelvic, floor, there, can, also, be, underlying, medical, reasons, for, urinary, incontinence, which, are, often, treatable, in, children, the, condition, is, called, enuresis, some, cancers, also, target, the, urinary, system, including, bladder, cancer, kidney, cancer, ureteral, cancer, and, urethral, cancer, due, to, the, role, and, location, of, these, organs, treatment, is, often, complicated, kidney, stones, have, been, identified, and, recorded, about, as, long, as, written, historical, records, exist, the, urinary, tract, including, the, ureters, as, well, as, their, function, to, drain, urine, from, the, kidneys, has, been, described, by, galen, in, the, second, century, ad, the, first, to, examine, the, ureter, through, an, internal, approach, called, ureteroscopy, rather, than, surgery, was, hampton, young, in, 1929, this, was, improved, on, by, vf, marshall, who, is, the, first, published, use, of, a, flexible, endoscope, based, on, fiber, optics, which, occurred, in, 1964, the, insertion, of, a, drainage, tube, into, the, renal, pelvis, bypassing, the, ureters, and, urinary, tract, called, nephrostomy, was, first, described, in, 1941, such, an, approach, differed, greatly, from, the, open, surgical, approaches, within, the, urinary, system, employed, during, the, preceding, two, millennia
