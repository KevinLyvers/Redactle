estrogen, british, english, oestrogen, see, spelling, differences, is, a, category, of, sex, hormone, responsible, for, the, development, and, regulation, of, the, female, reproductive, system, and, secondary, sex, characteristics, there, are, three, major, endogenous, estrogens, that, have, estrogenic, hormonal, activity, estrone, e1, estradiol, e2, and, estriol, e3, estradiol, an, estrane, is, the, most, potent, and, prevalent, another, estrogen, called, estetrol, e4, is, produced, only, during, pregnancy, estrogens, are, synthesized, in, all, vertebrates, and, some, insects, quantitatively, estrogens, circulate, at, lower, levels, than, androgens, in, both, men, and, women, while, estrogen, levels, are, significantly, lower, in, males, than, in, females, estrogens, nevertheless, have, important, physiological, roles, in, males, like, all, steroid, hormones, estrogens, readily, diffuse, across, the, cell, membrane, once, inside, the, cell, they, bind, to, and, activate, estrogen, receptors, ers, which, in, turn, modulate, the, expression, of, many, genes, additionally, estrogens, bind, to, and, activate, rapid, signaling, membrane, estrogen, receptors, mers, such, as, gper, gpr30, in, addition, to, their, role, as, natural, hormones, estrogens, are, used, as, medications, for, instance, in, menopausal, hormone, therapy, hormonal, birth, control, and, feminizing, hormone, therapy, for, transgender, women, intersex, people, and, nonbinary, people, synthetic, and, natural, estrogens, have, been, found, in, the, environment, and, are, referred, to, as, xenoestrogens, estrogens, are, among, the, wide, range, of, endocrine, disrupting, compounds, edcs, and, can, cause, health, issues, and, reproductive, disfunction, in, both, wildlife, and, humans, the, four, major, naturally, occurring, estrogens, in, women, are, estrone, e1, estradiol, e2, estriol, e3, and, estetrol, e4, estradiol, e2, is, the, predominant, estrogen, during, reproductive, years, both, in, terms, of, absolute, serum, levels, as, well, as, in, terms, of, estrogenic, activity, during, menopause, estrone, is, the, predominant, circulating, estrogen, and, during, pregnancy, estriol, is, the, predominant, circulating, estrogen, in, terms, of, serum, levels, given, by, subcutaneous, injection, in, mice, estradiol, is, about, 10, fold, more, potent, than, estrone, and, about, 100, fold, more, potent, than, estriol, thus, estradiol, is, the, most, important, estrogen, in, non, pregnant, females, who, are, between, the, menarche, and, menopause, stages, of, life, however, during, pregnancy, this, role, shifts, to, estriol, and, in, postmenopausal, women, estrone, becomes, the, primary, form, of, estrogen, in, the, body, another, type, of, estrogen, called, estetrol, e4, is, produced, only, during, pregnancy, all, of, the, different, forms, of, estrogen, are, synthesized, from, androgens, specifically, testosterone, and, androstenedione, by, the, enzyme, aromatase, minor, endogenous, estrogens, the, biosyntheses, of, which, do, not, involve, aromatase, include, 27, hydroxycholesterol, dehydroepiandrosterone, dhea, 7, oxo, dhea, 7, hydroxy, dhea, 16, hydroxy, dhea, 7, hydroxyepiandrosterone, androstenedione, a4, androstenediol, a5, 3, androstanediol, and, 3, androstanediol, some, estrogen, metabolites, such, as, the, catechol, estrogens, 2, hydroxyestradiol, 2, hydroxyestrone, 4, hydroxyestradiol, and, 4, hydroxyestrone, as, well, as, 16, hydroxyestrone, are, also, estrogens, with, varying, degrees, of, activity, the, biological, importance, of, these, minor, estrogens, is, not, entirely, clear, the, actions, of, estrogen, are, mediated, by, the, estrogen, receptor, er, a, dimeric, nuclear, protein, that, binds, to, dna, and, controls, gene, expression, like, other, steroid, hormones, estrogen, enters, passively, into, the, cell, where, it, binds, to, and, activates, the, estrogen, receptor, the, estrogen, er, complex, binds, to, specific, dna, sequences, called, a, hormone, response, element, to, activate, the, transcription, of, target, genes, in, a, study, using, an, estrogen, dependent, breast, cancer, cell, line, as, model, 89, such, genes, were, identified, since, estrogen, enters, all, cells, its, actions, are, dependent, on, the, presence, of, the, er, in, the, cell, the, er, is, expressed, in, specific, tissues, including, the, ovary, uterus, and, breast, the, metabolic, effects, of, estrogen, in, postmenopausal, women, have, been, linked, to, the, genetic, polymorphism, of, the, er, while, estrogens, are, present, in, both, men, and, women, they, are, usually, present, at, significantly, higher, levels, in, women, of, reproductive, age, they, promote, the, development, of, female, secondary, sexual, characteristics, such, as, breasts, darkening, and, enlargement, of, nipples, and, thickening, of, the, endometrium, and, other, aspects, of, regulating, the, menstrual, cycle, in, males, estrogen, regulates, certain, functions, of, the, reproductive, system, important, to, the, maturation, of, sperm, and, may, be, necessary, for, a, healthy, libido, estrogens, are, responsible, for, the, development, of, female, secondary, sexual, characteristics, during, puberty, including, breast, development, widening, of, the, hips, and, female, fat, distribution, conversely, androgens, are, responsible, for, pubic, and, body, hair, growth, as, well, as, acne, and, axillary, odor, estrogen, in, conjunction, with, growth, hormone, gh, and, its, secretory, product, insulin, like, growth, factor, 1, igf, 1, is, critical, in, mediating, breast, development, during, puberty, as, well, as, breast, maturation, during, pregnancy, in, preparation, of, lactation, and, breastfeeding, estrogen, is, primarily, and, directly, responsible, for, inducing, the, ductal, component, of, breast, development, as, well, as, for, causing, fat, deposition, and, connective, tissue, growth, it, is, also, indirectly, involved, in, the, lobuloalveolar, component, by, increasing, progesterone, receptor, expression, in, the, breasts, and, by, inducing, the, secretion, of, prolactin, allowed, for, by, estrogen, progesterone, and, prolactin, work, together, to, complete, lobuloalveolar, development, during, pregnancy, androgens, such, as, testosterone, powerfully, oppose, estrogen, action, in, the, breasts, such, as, by, reducing, estrogen, receptor, expression, in, them, estrogens, are, responsible, for, maturation, and, maintenance, of, the, vagina, and, uterus, and, are, also, involved, in, ovarian, function, such, as, maturation, of, ovarian, follicles, in, addition, estrogens, play, an, important, role, in, regulation, of, gonadotropin, secretion, for, these, reasons, estrogens, are, required, for, female, fertility, estrogen, regulated, dna, repair, mechanisms, in, the, brain, have, neuroprotective, effects, estrogen, regulates, the, transcription, of, dna, base, excision, repair, genes, as, well, as, the, translocation, of, the, base, excision, repair, enzymes, between, different, subcellular, compartments, estrogens, are, involved, in, libido, sex, drive, in, both, women, and, men, verbal, memory, scores, are, frequently, used, as, one, measure, of, higher, level, cognition, these, scores, vary, in, direct, proportion, to, estrogen, levels, throughout, the, menstrual, cycle, pregnancy, and, menopause, furthermore, estrogens, when, administered, shortly, after, natural, or, surgical, menopause, prevents, decreases, in, verbal, memory, in, contrast, estrogens, have, little, effect, on, verbal, memory, if, first, administered, years, after, menopause, estrogens, also, have, positive, influences, on, other, measures, of, cognitive, function, however, the, effect, of, estrogens, on, cognition, is, not, uniformly, favorable, and, is, dependent, on, the, timing, of, the, dose, and, the, type, of, cognitive, skill, being, measured, the, protective, effects, of, estrogens, on, cognition, may, be, mediated, by, estrogen, s, anti, inflammatory, effects, in, the, brain, studies, have, also, shown, that, the, met, allele, gene, and, level, of, estrogen, mediates, the, efficiency, of, prefrontal, cortex, dependent, working, memory, tasks, researchers, have, urged, for, further, research, to, illuminate, the, role, of, estrogen, and, its, potential, for, improvement, on, cognitive, function, estrogen, is, considered, to, play, a, significant, role, in, women, s, mental, health, sudden, estrogen, withdrawal, fluctuating, estrogen, and, periods, of, sustained, low, estrogen, levels, correlate, with, a, significant, lowering, of, mood, clinical, recovery, from, postpartum, perimenopause, and, postmenopause, depression, has, been, shown, to, be, effective, after, levels, of, estrogen, were, stabilized, and, or, restored, menstrual, exacerbation, including, menstrual, psychosis, is, typically, triggered, by, low, estrogen, levels, and, is, often, mistaken, for, premenstrual, dysphoric, disorder, compulsions, in, male, lab, mice, such, as, those, in, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, ocd, may, be, caused, by, low, estrogen, levels, when, estrogen, levels, were, raised, through, the, increased, activity, of, the, enzyme, aromatase, in, male, lab, mice, ocd, rituals, were, dramatically, decreased, hypothalamic, protein, levels, in, the, gene, comt, are, enhanced, by, increasing, estrogen, levels, which, are, believed, to, return, mice, that, displayed, ocd, rituals, to, normal, activity, aromatase, deficiency, is, ultimately, suspected, which, is, involved, in, the, synthesis, of, estrogen, in, humans, and, has, therapeutic, implications, in, humans, having, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, local, application, of, estrogen, in, the, rat, hippocampus, has, been, shown, to, inhibit, the, re, uptake, of, serotonin, contrarily, local, application, of, estrogen, has, been, shown, to, block, the, ability, of, fluvoxamine, to, slow, serotonin, clearance, suggesting, that, the, same, pathways, which, are, involved, in, ssri, efficacy, may, also, be, affected, by, components, of, local, estrogen, signaling, pathways, studies, have, also, found, that, fathers, had, lower, levels, of, cortisol, and, testosterone, but, higher, levels, of, estrogen, estradiol, than, did, non, fathers, estrogen, may, play, a, role, in, suppressing, binge, eating, hormone, replacement, therapy, using, estrogen, may, be, a, possible, treatment, for, binge, eating, behaviors, in, females, estrogen, replacement, has, been, shown, to, suppress, binge, eating, behaviors, in, female, mice, the, mechanism, by, which, estrogen, replacement, inhibits, binge, like, eating, involves, the, replacement, of, serotonin, 5, ht, neurons, women, exhibiting, binge, eating, behaviors, are, found, to, have, increased, brain, uptake, of, neuron, 5, ht, and, therefore, less, of, the, neurotransmitter, serotonin, in, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, estrogen, works, to, activate, 5, ht, neurons, leading, to, suppression, of, binge, like, eating, behaviors, it, is, also, suggested, that, there, is, an, interaction, between, hormone, levels, and, eating, at, different, points, in, the, female, menstrual, cycle, research, has, predicted, increased, emotional, eating, during, hormonal, flux, which, is, characterized, by, high, progesterone, and, estradiol, levels, that, occur, during, the, mid, luteal, phase, it, is, hypothesized, that, these, changes, occur, due, to, brain, changes, across, the, menstrual, cycle, that, are, likely, a, genomic, effect, of, hormones, these, effects, produce, menstrual, cycle, changes, which, result, in, hormone, release, leading, to, behavioral, changes, notably, binge, and, emotional, eating, these, occur, especially, prominently, among, women, who, are, genetically, vulnerable, to, binge, eating, phenotypes, binge, eating, is, associated, with, decreased, estradiol, and, increased, progesterone, klump, et, al, progesterone, may, moderate, the, effects, of, low, estradiol, such, as, during, dysregulated, eating, behavior, but, that, this, may, only, be, true, in, women, who, have, had, clinically, diagnosed, binge, episodes, bes, dysregulated, eating, is, more, strongly, associated, with, such, ovarian, hormones, in, women, with, bes, than, in, women, without, bes, the, implantation, of, 17, estradiol, pellets, in, ovariectomized, mice, significantly, reduced, binge, eating, behaviors, and, injections, of, glp, 1, in, ovariectomized, mice, decreased, binge, eating, behaviors, the, associations, between, binge, eating, menstrual, cycle, phase, and, ovarian, hormones, correlated, in, rodents, estrogens, which, are, locally, aromatized, from, androgens, in, the, brain, play, an, important, role, in, psychosexual, differentiation, for, example, by, masculinizing, territorial, behavior, the, same, is, not, true, in, humans, in, humans, the, masculinizing, effects, of, prenatal, androgens, on, behavior, and, other, tissues, with, the, possible, exception, of, effects, on, bone, appear, to, act, exclusively, through, the, androgen, receptor, consequently, the, utility, of, rodent, models, for, studying, human, psychosexual, differentiation, has, been, questioned, estrogens, are, responsible, for, both, the, pubertal, growth, spurt, which, causes, an, acceleration, in, linear, growth, and, epiphyseal, closure, which, limits, height, and, limb, length, in, both, females, and, males, in, addition, estrogens, are, responsible, for, bone, maturation, and, maintenance, of, bone, mineral, density, throughout, life, due, to, hypoestrogenism, the, risk, of, osteoporosis, increases, during, menopause, women, are, less, impacted, by, heart, disease, due, to, vasculo, protective, action, of, estrogen, which, helps, in, preventing, atherosclerosis, it, also, helps, in, maintaining, the, delicate, balance, between, fighting, infections, and, protecting, arteries, from, damage, thus, lowering, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, during, pregnancy, high, levels, of, estrogens, increase, coagulation, and, the, risk, of, venous, thromboembolism, estrogen, has, been, shown, to, upregulate, the, peptide, hormone, adropin, the, effect, of, estrogen, on, the, immune, system, is, in, general, described, as, th2, favoring, rather, than, suppressive, as, is, the, case, of, the, effect, of, male, sex, hormone, testosterone, indeed, women, respond, better, to, vaccines, infections, and, are, generally, less, likely, to, develop, cancer, the, tradeoff, of, this, is, that, they, are, more, likely, to, develop, an, autoimmune, disease, the, th2, shift, manifests, itself, in, a, decrease, of, cellular, immunity, and, increase, in, humoral, immunity, antibody, production, shifts, it, from, cellular, to, humoral, by, downregulating, cell, mediated, immunity, and, enhancing, th2, immune, response, by, stimulating, il, 4, production, and, th2, differentiation, type, 1, and, type, 17, immune, responses, are, downregulated, likely, to, be, at, least, partially, due, to, il, 4, which, inhibits, th1, effect, of, estrogen, on, different, immune, cells, cell, types, is, in, line, with, its, th2, bias, activity, of, basophils, eosinophils, m2, macrophages, and, is, enhanced, whereas, activity, of, nk, cells, is, downregulated, conventional, dendritic, cells, are, biased, towards, th2, under, the, influence, of, estrogen, whereas, plasmacytoid, dendritic, cells, key, players, in, antiviral, defence, have, increased, ifn, g, secretion, estrogen, also, influences, b, cells, by, increasing, their, survival, proliferation, differentiation, and, function, which, corresponds, with, higher, antibody, and, b, cell, count, generally, detected, in, women, on, a, molecular, level, estrogen, induces, the, above, mentioned, effects, on, cell, via, acting, on, intracellular, receptors, termed, er, and, er, which, upon, ligation, form, either, homo, or, heterodimers, the, genetic, and, nongenetic, targets, of, the, receptors, differ, between, homo, and, heterodimers, ligation, of, these, receptors, allows, them, to, translocate, to, the, nucleus, and, act, as, transcription, factors, either, by, binding, estrogen, response, elements, ere, on, dna, or, binding, dna, together, with, other, transcriptional, factors, e, g, nf, kb, or, ap, 1, both, of, which, result, in, rna, polymerase, recruitment, and, further, chromatin, remodelation, a, non, transcriptional, response, to, oestrogen, stimulation, was, also, documented, termed, membrane, initiated, steroid, signalling, miss, this, pathway, stimulates, the, erk, and, pi3k, akt, pathways, which, are, known, to, increase, cellular, proliferation, and, affect, chromatin, remodelation, researchers, have, implicated, estrogens, in, various, estrogen, dependent, conditions, such, as, er, positive, breast, cancer, as, well, as, a, number, of, genetic, conditions, involving, estrogen, signaling, or, metabolism, such, as, estrogen, insensitivity, syndrome, aromatase, deficiency, and, aromatase, excess, syndrome, high, estrogen, can, amplify, stress, hormone, responses, in, stressful, situations, estrogens, in, females, are, produced, primarily, by, the, ovaries, and, during, pregnancy, the, placenta, follicle, stimulating, hormone, fsh, stimulates, the, ovarian, production, of, estrogens, by, the, granulosa, cells, of, the, ovarian, follicles, and, corpora, lutea, some, estrogens, are, also, produced, in, smaller, amounts, by, other, tissues, such, as, the, liver, pancreas, bone, adrenal, glands, skin, brain, adipose, tissue, and, the, breasts, these, secondary, sources, of, estrogens, are, especially, important, in, postmenopausal, women, the, pathway, of, estrogen, biosynthesis, in, extragonadal, tissues, is, different, these, tissues, are, not, able, to, synthesize, c19, steroids, and, therefore, depend, on, c19, supplies, from, other, tissues, and, the, level, of, aromatase, in, females, synthesis, of, estrogens, starts, in, theca, interna, cells, in, the, ovary, by, the, synthesis, of, androstenedione, from, cholesterol, androstenedione, is, a, substance, of, weak, androgenic, activity, which, serves, predominantly, as, a, precursor, for, more, potent, androgens, such, as, testosterone, as, well, as, estrogen, this, compound, crosses, the, basal, membrane, into, the, surrounding, granulosa, cells, where, it, is, converted, either, immediately, into, estrone, or, into, testosterone, and, then, estradiol, in, an, additional, step, the, conversion, of, androstenedione, to, testosterone, is, catalyzed, by, 17, hydroxysteroid, dehydrogenase, 17, hsd, whereas, the, conversion, of, androstenedione, and, testosterone, into, estrone, and, estradiol, respectively, is, catalyzed, by, aromatase, enzymes, which, are, both, expressed, in, granulosa, cells, in, contrast, granulosa, cells, lack, 17, hydroxylase, and, 17, 20, lyase, whereas, theca, cells, express, these, enzymes, and, 17, hsd, but, lack, aromatase, hence, both, granulosa, and, theca, cells, are, essential, for, the, production, of, estrogen, in, the, ovaries, estrogen, levels, vary, through, the, menstrual, cycle, with, levels, highest, near, the, end, of, the, follicular, phase, just, before, ovulation, note, that, in, males, estrogen, is, also, produced, by, the, sertoli, cells, when, fsh, binds, to, their, fsh, receptors, estrogens, are, plasma, protein, bound, to, albumin, and, or, sex, hormone, binding, globulin, in, the, circulation, estrogens, are, metabolized, via, hydroxylation, by, cytochrome, p450, enzymes, such, as, cyp1a1, and, cyp3a4, and, via, conjugation, by, estrogen, sulfotransferases, sulfation, and, udp, glucuronyltransferases, glucuronidation, in, addition, estradiol, is, dehydrogenated, by, 17, hydroxysteroid, dehydrogenase, into, the, much, less, potent, estrogen, estrone, these, reactions, occur, primarily, in, the, liver, but, also, in, other, tissues, estrogens, are, inactivated, primarily, by, the, kidneys, and, liver, and, excreted, via, the, gastrointestinal, tract, in, the, form, of, conjugates, found, in, feces, bile, and, urine, estrogens, are, used, as, medications, mainly, in, hormonal, contraception, hormone, replacement, therapy, and, to, treat, gender, dysphoria, in, transgender, women, and, other, transfeminine, individuals, as, part, of, feminizing, hormone, therapy, the, estrogen, steroid, hormones, are, estrane, steroids, in, 1929, adolf, butenandt, and, edward, adelbert, doisy, independently, isolated, and, purified, estrone, the, first, estrogen, to, be, discovered, then, estriol, and, estradiol, were, discovered, in, 1930, and, 1933, respectively, shortly, following, their, discovery, estrogens, both, natural, and, synthetic, were, introduced, for, medical, use, examples, include, estriol, glucuronide, emmenin, progynon, estradiol, benzoate, conjugated, estrogens, premarin, diethylstilbestrol, and, ethinylestradiol, the, word, estrogen, derives, from, ancient, greek, it, is, derived, from, oestros, a, periodic, state, of, sexual, activity, in, female, mammals, and, genos, generating, it, was, first, published, in, the, early, 1920s, and, referenced, as, oestrin, with, the, years, american, english, adapted, the, spelling, of, estrogen, to, fit, with, its, phonetic, pronunciation, the, name, estrogen, is, derived, from, the, greek, o, stros, literally, meaning, verve, or, inspiration, but, figuratively, sexual, passion, or, desire, and, the, suffix, gen, meaning, producer, of, a, range, of, synthetic, and, natural, substances, that, possess, estrogenic, activity, have, been, identified, in, the, environment, and, are, referred, to, xenoestrogens, estrogens, are, among, the, wide, range, of, endocrine, disrupting, compounds, edcs, because, they, have, high, estrogenic, potency, when, an, edc, makes, its, way, into, the, environment, it, may, cause, male, reproductive, dysfunction, to, wildlife, and, humans, the, estrogen, excreted, from, farm, animals, makes, its, way, into, fresh, water, systems, during, the, germination, period, of, reproduction, the, fish, are, exposed, to, low, levels, of, estrogen, which, may, cause, reproductive, dysfunction, to, male, fish, some, hair, shampoos, on, the, market, include, estrogens, and, placental, extracts, others, contain, phytoestrogens, in, 1998, there, were, case, reports, of, four, prepubescent, african, american, girls, developing, breasts, after, exposure, to, these, shampoos, in, 1993, the, fda, determined, that, not, all, over, the, counter, topically, applied, hormone, containing, drug, products, for, human, use, are, generally, recognized, as, safe, and, effective, and, are, misbranded, an, accompanying, proposed, rule, deals, with, cosmetics, concluding, that, any, use, of, natural, estrogens, in, a, cosmetic, product, makes, the, product, an, unapproved, new, drug, and, that, any, cosmetic, using, the, term, hormone, in, the, text, of, its, labeling, or, in, its, ingredient, statement, makes, an, implied, drug, claim, subjecting, such, a, product, to, regulatory, action, in, addition, to, being, considered, misbranded, drugs, products, claiming, to, contain, placental, extract, may, also, be, deemed, to, be, misbranded, cosmetics, if, the, extract, has, been, prepared, from, placentas, from, which, the, hormones, and, other, biologically, active, substances, have, been, removed, and, the, extracted, substance, consists, principally, of, protein, the, fda, recommends, that, this, substance, be, identified, by, a, name, other, than, placental, extract, and, describing, its, composition, more, accurately, because, consumers, associate, the, name, placental, extract, with, a, therapeutic, use, of, some, biological, activity
