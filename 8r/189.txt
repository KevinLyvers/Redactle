beta, cells, of, the, pancreatic, islets, encoded, in, humans, by, the, insulin, ins, gene, it, is, the, main, anabolic, hormone, of, the, body, it, regulates, the, metabolism, of, carbohydrates, fats, and, protein, by, promoting, the, absorption, of, glucose, from, the, blood, into, cells, of, the, liver, fat, and, skeletal, muscles, in, these, tissues, the, absorbed, glucose, is, converted, into, either, glycogen, via, glycogenesis, or, fats, triglycerides, via, lipogenesis, in, the, liver, glucose, is, converted, into, both, glucose, production, and, secretion, by, the, liver, are, strongly, inhibited, by, high, concentrations, of, insulin, in, the, blood, circulating, insulin, also, affects, the, synthesis, of, proteins, in, a, wide, variety, of, tissues, it, is, thus, an, anabolic, hormone, promoting, the, conversion, of, small, molecules, in, the, blood, into, large, molecules, in, the, cells, low, insulin, in, the, blood, has, the, opposite, effect, promoting, widespread, catabolism, especially, of, reserve, body, fat, beta, cells, are, sensitive, to, blood, sugar, levels, so, that, they, secrete, insulin, into, the, blood, in, response, to, high, level, of, glucose, and, inhibit, secretion, of, insulin, when, glucose, levels, are, low, insulin, production, is, also, regulated, by, glucose, high, glucose, promotes, insulin, production, while, low, glucose, levels, lead, to, lower, production, insulin, enhances, glucose, uptake, and, metabolism, in, the, cells, thereby, reducing, blood, sugar, their, neighboring, alpha, cells, by, taking, their, cues, from, the, beta, cells, secrete, glucagon, into, the, blood, in, the, opposite, manner, increased, secretion, when, blood, glucose, is, low, and, decreased, secretion, when, glucose, concentrations, are, high, glucagon, increases, blood, glucose, by, stimulating, glycogenolysis, and, gluconeogenesis, in, the, liver, the, secretion, of, insulin, and, glucagon, into, the, blood, in, response, to, the, blood, glucose, concentration, is, the, primary, mechanism, of, glucose, homeostasis, decreased, or, absent, insulin, activity, results, in, diabetes, a, condition, of, high, blood, sugar, level, hyperglycaemia, there, are, two, types, of, the, disease, in, type, 1, diabetes, the, beta, cells, are, destroyed, by, an, autoimmune, reaction, so, that, insulin, can, no, longer, be, synthesized, or, be, secreted, into, the, blood, in, type, 2, diabetes, the, destruction, of, beta, cells, is, less, pronounced, than, in, type, 1, and, is, not, due, to, an, autoimmune, process, instead, there, is, an, accumulation, of, amyloid, in, the, pancreatic, islets, which, likely, disrupts, their, anatomy, and, physiology, the, pathogenesis, of, type, 2, diabetes, is, not, well, understood, but, reduced, population, of, islet, beta, cells, reduced, secretory, function, of, islet, beta, cells, that, survive, and, peripheral, tissue, insulin, resistance, are, known, to, be, involved, type, 2, diabetes, is, characterized, by, increased, glucagon, secretion, which, is, unaffected, by, and, unresponsive, to, the, concentration, of, blood, glucose, but, insulin, is, still, secreted, into, the, blood, in, response, to, the, blood, glucose, as, a, result, glucose, accumulates, in, the, blood, the, human, insulin, protein, is, composed, of, 51, amino, acids, and, has, a, molecular, mass, of, 5808, da, it, is, a, hetero, dimer, of, an, a, chain, and, a, b, chain, which, are, linked, together, by, disulfide, bonds, insulin, s, structure, varies, slightly, between, species, of, animals, insulin, from, non, human, animal, sources, differs, somewhat, in, effectiveness, in, carbohydrate, metabolism, effects, from, human, insulin, because, of, these, variations, porcine, insulin, is, especially, close, to, the, human, version, and, was, widely, used, to, treat, type, 1, diabetics, before, human, insulin, could, be, produced, in, large, quantities, by, recombinant, dna, technologies, insulin, was, the, first, peptide, hormone, discovered, frederick, banting, and, charles, best, working, in, the, laboratory, of, john, macleod, at, the, university, of, toronto, were, the, first, to, isolate, insulin, from, dog, pancreas, in, 1921, frederick, sanger, sequenced, the, amino, acid, structure, in, 1951, which, made, insulin, the, first, protein, to, be, fully, sequenced, the, crystal, structure, of, insulin, in, the, solid, state, was, determined, by, dorothy, hodgkin, in, 1969, insulin, is, also, the, first, protein, to, be, chemically, synthesised, and, produced, by, dna, recombinant, technology, it, is, on, the, who, model, list, of, essential, medicines, the, most, important, medications, needed, in, a, basic, health, system, insulin, may, have, originated, more, than, a, billion, years, ago, the, molecular, origins, of, insulin, go, at, least, as, far, back, as, the, simplest, unicellular, eukaryotes, apart, from, animals, insulin, like, proteins, are, also, known, to, exist, in, fungi, and, protists, insulin, is, produced, by, beta, cells, of, the, pancreatic, islets, in, most, vertebrates, and, by, the, brockmann, body, in, some, teleost, fish, cone, snails, conus, geographus, and, conus, tulipa, venomous, sea, snails, that, hunt, small, fish, use, modified, forms, of, insulin, in, their, venom, cocktails, the, insulin, toxin, closer, in, structure, to, fishes, than, to, snails, native, insulin, slows, down, the, prey, fishes, by, lowering, their, blood, glucose, levels, insulin, is, produced, exclusively, in, the, beta, cells, of, the, pancreatic, islets, in, mammals, and, the, brockmann, body, in, some, fish, human, insulin, is, produced, from, the, ins, gene, located, on, chromosome, 11, rodents, have, two, functional, insulin, genes, one, is, the, homolog, of, most, mammalian, genes, ins2, and, the, other, is, a, retroposed, copy, that, includes, promoter, sequence, but, that, is, missing, an, intron, ins1, transcription, of, the, insulin, gene, increases, in, response, to, elevated, blood, glucose, this, is, primarily, controlled, by, transcription, factors, that, bind, enhancer, sequences, in, the, 400, base, pairs, before, the, gene, s, transcription, start, site, the, major, transcription, factors, influencing, insulin, secretion, are, pdx1, neurod1, and, mafa, during, a, low, glucose, state, pdx1, pancreatic, and, duodenal, homeobox, protein, 1, is, located, in, the, nuclear, periphery, as, a, result, of, interaction, with, hdac1, and, 2, which, results, in, downregulation, of, insulin, secretion, an, increase, in, blood, glucose, levels, causes, phosphorylation, of, pdx1, which, leads, it, to, undergo, nuclear, translocation, and, bind, the, a3, element, within, the, insulin, promoter, upon, translocation, it, interacts, with, coactivators, hat, p300, and, setd7, pdx1, affects, the, histone, modifications, through, acetylation, and, deacetylation, as, well, as, methylation, it, is, also, said, to, suppress, glucagon, neurod1, also, known, as, 2, regulates, insulin, exocytosis, in, pancreatic, cells, by, directly, inducing, the, expression, of, genes, involved, in, exocytosis, it, is, localized, in, the, cytosol, but, in, response, to, high, glucose, it, becomes, glycosylated, by, ogt, and, or, phosphorylated, by, erk, which, causes, translocation, to, the, nucleus, in, the, nucleus, 2, heterodimerizes, with, e47, binds, to, the, e1, element, of, the, insulin, promoter, and, recruits, co, activator, p300, which, acetylates, 2, it, is, able, to, interact, with, other, transcription, factors, as, well, in, activation, of, the, insulin, gene, mafa, is, degraded, by, proteasomes, upon, low, blood, glucose, levels, increased, levels, of, glucose, make, an, unknown, protein, glycosylated, this, protein, works, as, a, transcription, factor, for, mafa, in, an, unknown, manner, and, mafa, is, transported, out, of, the, cell, mafa, is, then, translocated, back, into, the, nucleus, where, it, binds, the, c1, element, of, the, insulin, promoter, these, transcription, factors, work, synergistically, and, in, a, complex, arrangement, increased, blood, glucose, can, after, a, while, destroy, the, binding, capacities, of, these, proteins, and, therefore, reduce, the, amount, of, insulin, secreted, causing, diabetes, the, decreased, binding, activities, can, be, mediated, by, glucose, induced, oxidative, stress, and, antioxidants, are, said, to, prevent, the, decreased, insulin, secretion, in, glucotoxic, pancreatic, cells, stress, signalling, molecules, and, reactive, oxygen, species, inhibits, the, insulin, gene, by, interfering, with, the, cofactors, binding, the, transcription, factors, and, the, transcription, factors, itself, several, regulatory, sequences, in, the, promoter, region, of, the, human, insulin, gene, bind, to, transcription, factors, in, general, the, a, boxes, bind, to, pdx1, factors, e, boxes, bind, to, neurod, c, boxes, bind, to, mafa, and, camp, response, elements, to, creb, there, are, also, silencers, that, inhibit, transcription, insulin, is, synthesized, as, an, inactive, precursor, molecule, a, 110, amino, acid, long, protein, called, preproinsulin, preproinsulin, is, translated, directly, into, the, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, rer, where, its, signal, peptide, is, removed, by, signal, peptidase, to, form, proinsulin, as, the, proinsulin, folds, opposite, ends, of, the, protein, called, the, a, chain, and, the, b, chain, are, fused, together, with, three, disulfide, bonds, folded, proinsulin, then, transits, through, the, golgi, apparatus, and, is, packaged, into, specialized, secretory, vesicles, in, the, granule, proinsulin, is, cleaved, by, proprotein, convertase, 1, 3, and, proprotein, convertase, 2, removing, the, middle, part, of, the, protein, called, the, c, peptide, finally, carboxypeptidase, e, removes, two, pairs, of, amino, acids, from, the, protein, s, ends, resulting, in, active, insulin, the, insulin, a, and, b, chains, now, connected, with, two, disulfide, bonds, the, resulting, mature, insulin, is, packaged, inside, mature, granules, waiting, for, metabolic, signals, such, as, leucine, arginine, glucose, and, mannose, and, vagal, nerve, stimulation, to, be, exocytosed, from, the, cell, into, the, circulation, insulin, and, its, related, proteins, have, been, shown, to, be, produced, inside, the, brain, and, reduced, levels, of, these, proteins, are, linked, to, alzheimer, s, disease, insulin, release, is, stimulated, also, by, beta, 2, receptor, stimulation, and, inhibited, by, alpha, 1, receptor, stimulation, in, addition, cortisol, glucagon, and, growth, hormone, antagonize, the, actions, of, insulin, during, times, of, stress, insulin, also, inhibits, fatty, acid, release, by, hormone, sensitive, lipase, in, adipose, tissue, contrary, to, an, initial, belief, that, hormones, would, be, generally, small, chemical, molecules, as, the, first, peptide, hormone, known, of, its, structure, insulin, was, found, to, be, quite, large, a, single, protein, monomer, of, human, insulin, is, composed, of, 51, amino, acids, and, has, a, molecular, mass, of, 5808, da, the, molecular, formula, of, human, insulin, is, c, 257, h, 383, n, 65, o, 77, s, 6, it, is, a, combination, of, two, peptide, chains, dimer, named, an, a, chain, and, a, b, chain, which, are, linked, together, by, two, disulfide, bonds, the, a, chain, is, composed, of, 21, amino, acids, while, the, b, chain, consists, of, 30, residues, the, linking, interchain, disulfide, bonds, are, formed, at, cysteine, residues, between, the, positions, a7, b7, and, a20, b19, there, is, an, additional, intrachain, disulfide, bond, within, the, a, chain, between, cysteine, residues, at, positions, a6, and, a11, the, a, chain, exhibits, two, helical, regions, at, a1, a8, and, a12, a19, which, are, antiparallel, while, the, b, chain, has, a, central, helix, covering, residues, b9, b19, flanked, by, the, disulfide, bond, on, either, sides, and, two, sheets, covering, b7, b10, and, b20, b23, the, amino, acid, sequence, of, insulin, is, strongly, conserved, and, varies, only, slightly, between, species, bovine, insulin, differs, from, human, in, only, three, amino, acid, residues, and, porcine, insulin, in, one, even, insulin, from, some, species, of, fish, is, similar, enough, to, human, to, be, clinically, effective, in, humans, insulin, in, some, invertebrates, is, quite, similar, in, sequence, to, human, insulin, and, has, similar, physiological, effects, the, strong, homology, seen, in, the, insulin, sequence, of, diverse, species, suggests, that, it, has, been, conserved, across, much, of, animal, evolutionary, history, the, c, peptide, of, proinsulin, however, differs, much, more, among, species, it, is, also, a, hormone, but, a, secondary, one, insulin, is, produced, and, stored, in, the, body, as, a, hexamer, a, unit, of, six, insulin, molecules, while, the, active, form, is, the, monomer, the, hexamer, is, about, 36000, da, in, size, the, six, molecules, are, linked, together, as, three, dimeric, units, to, form, symmetrical, molecule, an, important, feature, is, the, presence, of, zinc, atoms, zn, 2, on, the, axis, of, symmetry, which, are, surrounded, by, three, water, molecules, and, three, histidine, residues, at, position, b10, the, hexamer, is, an, inactive, form, with, long, term, stability, which, serves, as, a, way, to, keep, the, highly, reactive, insulin, protected, yet, readily, available, the, hexamer, monomer, conversion, is, one, of, the, central, aspects, of, insulin, formulations, for, injection, the, hexamer, is, far, more, stable, than, the, monomer, which, is, desirable, for, practical, reasons, however, the, monomer, is, a, much, faster, reacting, drug, because, diffusion, rate, is, inversely, related, to, particle, size, a, fast, reacting, drug, means, insulin, injections, do, not, have, to, precede, mealtimes, by, hours, which, in, turn, gives, people, with, diabetes, more, flexibility, in, their, daily, schedules, insulin, can, aggregate, and, form, fibrillar, interdigitated, beta, sheets, this, can, cause, injection, amyloidosis, and, prevents, the, storage, of, insulin, for, long, periods, beta, cells, in, the, islets, of, langerhans, release, insulin, in, two, phases, the, first, phase, release, is, rapidly, triggered, in, response, to, increased, blood, glucose, levels, and, lasts, about, 10, minutes, the, second, phase, is, a, sustained, slow, release, of, newly, formed, vesicles, triggered, independently, of, sugar, peaking, in, 2, to, 3, hours, the, two, phases, of, the, insulin, release, suggest, that, insulin, granules, are, present, in, diverse, stated, populations, or, pools, during, the, first, phase, of, insulin, exocytosis, most, of, the, granules, predispose, for, exocytosis, are, released, after, the, calcium, internalization, this, pool, is, known, as, readily, releasable, pool, rrp, the, rrp, granules, represent, 0, 3, 0, 7, of, the, total, insulin, containing, granule, population, and, they, are, found, immediately, adjacent, to, the, plasma, membrane, during, the, second, phase, of, exocytosis, insulin, granules, require, mobilization, of, granules, to, the, plasma, membrane, and, a, previous, preparation, to, undergo, their, release, thus, the, second, phase, of, insulin, release, is, governed, by, the, rate, at, which, granules, get, ready, for, release, this, pool, is, known, as, a, reserve, pool, rp, the, rp, is, released, slower, than, the, rrp, rrp, 18, granules, min, rp, 6, granules, min, reduced, first, phase, insulin, release, may, be, the, earliest, detectable, beta, cell, defect, predicting, onset, of, type, 2, diabetes, first, phase, release, and, insulin, sensitivity, are, independent, predictors, of, diabetes, the, description, of, first, phase, release, is, as, follows, this, is, the, primary, mechanism, for, release, of, insulin, other, substances, known, to, stimulate, insulin, release, include, the, amino, acids, arginine, and, leucine, parasympathetic, release, of, acetylcholine, acting, via, the, phospholipase, c, pathway, sulfonylurea, cholecystokinin, cck, also, via, phospholipase, c, and, the, gastrointestinally, derived, incretins, such, as, glucagon, like, peptide, 1, glp, 1, and, glucose, dependent, insulinotropic, peptide, gip, release, of, insulin, is, strongly, inhibited, by, norepinephrine, noradrenaline, which, leads, to, increased, blood, glucose, levels, during, stress, it, appears, that, release, of, catecholamines, by, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, has, conflicting, influences, on, insulin, release, by, beta, cells, because, insulin, release, is, inhibited, by, 2, adrenergic, receptors, and, stimulated, by, 2, adrenergic, receptors, the, net, effect, of, norepinephrine, from, sympathetic, nerves, and, epinephrine, from, adrenal, glands, on, insulin, release, is, inhibition, due, to, dominance, of, the, adrenergic, receptors, when, the, glucose, level, comes, down, to, the, usual, physiologic, value, insulin, release, from, the, cells, slows, or, stops, if, the, blood, glucose, level, drops, lower, than, this, especially, to, dangerously, low, levels, release, of, hyperglycemic, hormones, most, prominently, glucagon, from, islet, of, langerhans, alpha, cells, forces, release, of, glucose, into, the, blood, from, the, liver, glycogen, stores, supplemented, by, gluconeogenesis, if, the, glycogen, stores, become, depleted, by, increasing, blood, glucose, the, hyperglycemic, hormones, prevent, or, correct, life, threatening, hypoglycemia, evidence, of, impaired, first, phase, insulin, release, can, be, seen, in, the, glucose, tolerance, test, demonstrated, by, a, substantially, elevated, blood, glucose, level, at, 30, minutes, after, the, ingestion, of, a, glucose, load, 75, or, 100, g, of, glucose, followed, by, a, slow, drop, over, the, next, 100, minutes, to, remain, above, 120, mg, 100, ml, after, two, hours, after, the, start, of, the, test, in, a, normal, person, the, blood, glucose, level, is, corrected, and, may, even, be, slightly, over, corrected, by, the, end, of, the, test, an, insulin, spike, is, a, first, response, to, blood, glucose, increase, this, response, is, individual, and, dose, specific, although, it, was, always, previously, assumed, to, be, food, type, specific, only, even, during, digestion, in, general, one, or, two, hours, following, a, meal, insulin, release, from, the, pancreas, is, not, continuous, but, oscillates, with, a, period, of, 3, 6, minutes, changing, from, generating, a, blood, insulin, concentration, more, than, about, 800, p, mol, l, to, less, than, 100, pmol, l, in, rats, this, is, thought, to, avoid, downregulation, of, insulin, receptors, in, target, cells, and, to, assist, the, liver, in, extracting, insulin, from, the, blood, this, oscillation, is, important, to, consider, when, administering, insulin, stimulating, medication, since, it, is, the, oscillating, blood, concentration, of, insulin, release, which, should, ideally, be, achieved, not, a, constant, high, concentration, this, may, be, achieved, by, delivering, insulin, rhythmically, to, the, portal, vein, by, light, activated, delivery, or, by, islet, cell, transplantation, to, the, liver, the, blood, insulin, level, can, be, measured, in, international, units, such, as, iu, ml, or, in, molar, concentration, such, as, pmol, l, where, 1, iu, ml, equals, 6, 945, pmol, l, a, typical, blood, level, between, meals, is, 8, 11, iu, ml, 57, 79, pmol, l, the, effects, of, insulin, are, initiated, by, its, binding, to, a, receptor, the, insulin, receptor, ir, present, in, the, cell, membrane, the, receptor, molecule, contains, an, and, subunits, two, molecules, are, joined, to, form, what, is, known, as, a, homodimer, insulin, binds, to, the, subunits, of, the, homodimer, which, faces, the, extracellular, side, of, the, cells, the, subunits, have, tyrosine, kinase, enzyme, activity, which, is, triggered, by, the, insulin, binding, this, activity, provokes, the, autophosphorylation, of, the, subunits, and, subsequently, the, phosphorylation, of, proteins, inside, the, cell, known, as, insulin, receptor, substrates, irs, the, phosphorylation, of, the, irs, activates, a, signal, transduction, cascade, that, leads, to, the, activation, of, other, kinases, as, well, as, transcription, factors, that, mediate, the, intracellular, effects, of, insulin, the, cascade, that, leads, to, the, insertion, of, glut4, glucose, transporters, into, the, cell, membranes, of, muscle, and, fat, cells, and, to, the, synthesis, of, glycogen, in, liver, and, muscle, tissue, as, well, as, the, conversion, of, glucose, into, triglycerides, in, liver, adipose, and, lactating, mammary, gland, tissue, operates, via, the, activation, by, irs, 1, of, phosphoinositol, 3, kinase, pi3k, this, enzyme, converts, a, phospholipid, in, the, cell, membrane, by, the, name, of, phosphatidylinositol, 4, 5, bisphosphate, pip2, into, phosphatidylinositol, 3, 4, 5, triphosphate, pip3, which, in, turn, activates, protein, kinase, b, pkb, activated, pkb, facilitates, the, fusion, of, glut4, containing, endosomes, with, the, cell, membrane, resulting, in, an, increase, in, glut4, transporters, in, the, plasma, membrane, pkb, also, phosphorylates, glycogen, synthase, kinase, gsk, thereby, inactivating, this, enzyme, this, means, that, its, substrate, glycogen, synthase, gs, cannot, be, phosphorylated, and, remains, dephosphorylated, and, therefore, active, the, active, enzyme, glycogen, synthase, gs, catalyzes, the, rate, limiting, step, in, the, synthesis, of, glycogen, from, glucose, similar, dephosphorylations, affect, the, enzymes, controlling, the, rate, of, glycolysis, leading, to, the, synthesis, of, fats, via, malonyl, coa, in, the, tissues, that, can, generate, triglycerides, and, also, the, enzymes, that, control, the, rate, of, gluconeogenesis, in, the, liver, the, overall, effect, of, these, final, enzyme, dephosphorylations, is, that, in, the, tissues, that, can, carry, out, these, reactions, glycogen, and, fat, synthesis, from, glucose, are, stimulated, and, glucose, production, by, the, liver, through, glycogenolysis, and, gluconeogenesis, are, inhibited, the, breakdown, of, triglycerides, by, adipose, tissue, into, free, fatty, acids, and, glycerol, is, also, inhibited, after, the, intracellular, signal, that, resulted, from, the, binding, of, insulin, to, its, receptor, has, been, produced, termination, of, signaling, is, then, needed, as, mentioned, below, in, the, section, on, degradation, endocytosis, and, degradation, of, the, receptor, bound, to, insulin, is, a, main, mechanism, to, end, signaling, in, addition, the, signaling, pathway, is, also, terminated, by, dephosphorylation, of, the, tyrosine, residues, in, the, various, signaling, pathways, by, tyrosine, phosphatases, serine, threonine, kinases, are, also, known, to, reduce, the, activity, of, insulin, the, structure, of, the, insulin, insulin, receptor, complex, has, been, determined, using, the, techniques, of, x, ray, crystallography, the, actions, of, insulin, on, the, global, human, metabolism, level, include, the, actions, of, insulin, indirect, and, direct, on, cells, include, insulin, also, influences, other, body, functions, such, as, vascular, compliance, and, cognition, once, insulin, enters, the, human, brain, it, enhances, learning, and, memory, and, benefits, verbal, memory, in, particular, enhancing, brain, insulin, signaling, by, means, of, intranasal, insulin, administration, also, enhances, the, acute, thermoregulatory, and, glucoregulatory, response, to, food, intake, suggesting, that, central, nervous, insulin, contributes, to, the, co, ordination, of, a, wide, variety, of, homeostatic, or, regulatory, processes, in, the, human, body, insulin, also, has, stimulatory, effects, on, gonadotropin, releasing, hormone, from, the, hypothalamus, thus, favoring, fertility, once, an, insulin, molecule, has, docked, onto, the, receptor, and, effected, its, action, it, may, be, released, back, into, the, extracellular, environment, or, it, may, be, degraded, by, the, cell, the, two, primary, sites, for, insulin, clearance, are, the, liver, and, the, kidney, it, is, broken, down, by, the, enzyme, protein, disulfide, reductase, glutathione, which, breaks, the, disulphide, bonds, between, the, a, and, b, chains, the, liver, clears, most, insulin, during, first, pass, transit, whereas, the, kidney, clears, most, of, the, insulin, in, systemic, circulation, degradation, normally, involves, endocytosis, of, the, insulin, receptor, complex, followed, by, the, action, of, insulin, degrading, enzyme, an, insulin, molecule, produced, endogenously, by, the, beta, cells, is, estimated, to, be, degraded, within, about, one, hour, after, its, initial, release, into, circulation, insulin, half, life, 4, 6, minutes, insulin, is, a, major, regulator, of, endocannabinoid, ec, metabolism, and, insulin, treatment, has, been, shown, to, reduce, intracellular, ecs, the, 2, arachidonoylglycerol, 2, ag, and, anandamide, aea, which, correspond, with, insulin, sensitive, expression, changes, in, enzymes, of, ec, metabolism, in, insulin, resistant, adipocytes, patterns, of, insulin, induced, enzyme, expression, is, disturbed, in, a, manner, consistent, with, elevated, ec, synthesis, and, reduced, ec, degradation, findings, suggest, that, insulin, resistant, adipocytes, fail, to, regulate, ec, metabolism, and, decrease, intracellular, ec, levels, in, response, to, insulin, stimulation, whereby, obese, insulin, resistant, individuals, exhibit, increased, concentrations, of, ecs, this, dysregulation, contributes, to, excessive, visceral, fat, accumulation, and, reduced, adiponectin, release, from, abdominal, adipose, tissue, and, further, to, the, onset, of, several, cardiometabolic, risk, factors, that, are, associated, with, obesity, and, type, 2, diabetes, hypoglycemia, also, known, as, low, blood, sugar, is, when, blood, sugar, decreases, to, below, normal, levels, this, may, result, in, a, variety, of, symptoms, including, clumsiness, trouble, talking, confusion, loss, of, consciousness, seizures, or, death, a, feeling, of, hunger, sweating, shakiness, and, weakness, may, also, be, present, symptoms, typically, come, on, quickly, the, most, common, cause, of, hypoglycemia, is, medications, used, to, treat, diabetes, such, as, insulin, and, sulfonylureas, risk, is, greater, in, diabetics, who, have, eaten, less, than, usual, exercised, more, than, usual, or, have, consumed, alcohol, other, causes, of, hypoglycemia, include, kidney, failure, certain, tumors, such, as, insulinoma, liver, disease, hypothyroidism, starvation, inborn, error, of, metabolism, severe, infections, reactive, hypoglycemia, and, a, number, of, drugs, including, alcohol, low, blood, sugar, may, occur, in, otherwise, healthy, babies, who, have, not, eaten, for, a, few, hours, there, are, several, conditions, in, which, insulin, disturbance, is, pathologic, biosynthetic, human, insulin, insulin, human, rdna, inn, for, clinical, use, is, manufactured, by, recombinant, dna, technology, biosynthetic, human, insulin, has, increased, purity, when, compared, with, extractive, animal, insulin, enhanced, purity, reducing, antibody, formation, researchers, have, succeeded, in, introducing, the, gene, for, human, insulin, into, plants, as, another, method, of, producing, insulin, biopharming, in, safflower, this, technique, is, anticipated, to, reduce, production, costs, several, analogs, of, human, insulin, are, available, these, insulin, analogs, are, closely, related, to, the, human, insulin, structure, and, were, developed, for, specific, aspects, of, glycemic, control, in, terms, of, fast, action, prandial, insulins, and, long, action, basal, insulins, the, first, biosynthetic, insulin, analog, was, developed, for, clinical, use, at, mealtime, prandial, insulin, humalog, insulin, lispro, it, is, more, rapidly, absorbed, after, subcutaneous, injection, than, regular, insulin, with, an, effect, 15, minutes, after, injection, other, rapid, acting, analogues, are, novorapid, and, apidra, with, similar, profiles, all, are, rapidly, absorbed, due, to, amino, acid, sequences, that, will, reduce, formation, of, dimers, and, hexamers, monomeric, insulins, are, more, rapidly, absorbed, fast, acting, insulins, do, not, require, the, injection, to, meal, interval, previously, recommended, for, human, insulin, and, animal, insulins, the, other, type, is, long, acting, insulin, the, first, of, these, was, lantus, insulin, glargine, these, have, a, steady, effect, for, an, extended, period, from, 18, to, 24, hours, likewise, another, protracted, insulin, analogue, levemir, is, based, on, a, fatty, acid, acylation, approach, a, myristic, acid, molecule, is, attached, to, this, analogue, which, associates, the, insulin, molecule, to, the, abundant, serum, albumin, which, in, turn, extends, the, effect, and, reduces, the, risk, of, hypoglycemia, both, protracted, analogues, need, to, be, taken, only, once, daily, and, are, used, for, type, 1, diabetics, as, the, basal, insulin, a, combination, of, a, rapid, acting, and, a, protracted, insulin, is, also, available, making, it, more, likely, for, patients, to, achieve, an, insulin, profile, that, mimics, that, of, the, body, s, own, insulin, release, insulin, is, also, used, in, many, cell, lines, such, as, cho, s, hek, 293, or, sf9, for, the, manufacturing, of, monoclonal, antibodies, virus, vaccines, and, gene, therapy, products, insulin, is, usually, taken, as, subcutaneous, injections, by, single, use, syringes, with, needles, via, an, insulin, pump, or, by, repeated, use, insulin, pens, with, disposable, needles, inhaled, insulin, is, also, available, in, the, u, s, market, the, dispovan, single, use, pen, needle, by, hmd, is, india, s, first, insulin, pen, needle, that, makes, self, administration, easy, featuring, extra, thin, walls, and, a, multi, bevel, tapered, point, these, pen, needles, prioritise, patient, comfort, by, minimising, pain, and, ensuring, seamless, medication, delivery, the, product, aims, to, provide, affordable, pen, needles, to, the, developing, part, of, the, country, through, its, wide, distribution, channel, additionally, the, universal, design, of, these, needles, guarantees, compatibility, with, all, insulin, pens, unlike, many, medicines, insulin, cannot, be, taken, by, mouth, because, like, nearly, all, other, proteins, introduced, into, the, gastrointestinal, tract, it, is, reduced, to, fragments, whereupon, all, activity, is, lost, there, has, been, some, research, into, ways, to, protect, insulin, from, the, digestive, tract, so, that, it, can, be, administered, orally, or, sublingually, in, 2021, the, world, health, organization, added, insulin, to, its, model, list, of, essential, medicines, insulin, and, all, other, medications, are, supplied, free, of, charge, to, people, with, diabetes, by, the, national, health, service, in, the, countries, of, the, united, kingdom, in, 1869, while, studying, the, structure, of, the, pancreas, under, a, microscope, paul, langerhans, a, medical, student, in, berlin, identified, some, previously, unnoticed, tissue, clumps, scattered, throughout, the, bulk, of, the, pancreas, the, function, of, the, little, heaps, of, cells, later, known, as, the, islets, of, langerhans, initially, remained, unknown, but, douard, laguesse, later, suggested, they, might, produce, secretions, that, play, a, regulatory, role, in, digestion, paul, langerhans, son, archibald, also, helped, to, understand, this, regulatory, role, in, 1889, the, physician, oskar, minkowski, in, collaboration, with, joseph, von, mering, removed, the, pancreas, from, a, healthy, dog, to, test, its, assumed, role, in, digestion, on, testing, the, urine, they, found, sugar, establishing, for, the, first, time, a, relationship, between, the, pancreas, and, diabetes, in, 1901, another, major, step, was, taken, by, the, american, physician, and, scientist, eugene, lindsay, opie, when, he, isolated, the, role, of, the, pancreas, to, the, islets, of, langerhans, diabetes, mellitus, when, the, result, of, a, lesion, of, the, pancreas, is, caused, by, destruction, of, the, islands, of, langerhans, and, occurs, only, when, these, bodies, are, in, part, or, wholly, destroyed, over, the, next, two, decades, researchers, made, several, attempts, to, isolate, the, islets, secretions, in, 1906, george, ludwig, zuelzer, achieved, partial, success, in, treating, dogs, with, pancreatic, extract, but, he, was, unable, to, continue, his, work, between, 1911, and, 1912, e, l, scott, at, the, university, of, chicago, tried, aqueous, pancreatic, extracts, and, noted, a, slight, diminution, of, glycosuria, but, was, unable, to, convince, his, director, of, his, work, s, value, it, was, shut, down, israel, kleiner, demonstrated, similar, effects, at, rockefeller, university, in, 1915, but, world, war, i, interrupted, his, work, and, he, did, not, return, to, it, in, 1916, nicolae, paulescu, developed, an, aqueous, pancreatic, extract, which, when, injected, into, a, diabetic, dog, had, a, normalizing, effect, on, blood, sugar, levels, he, had, to, interrupt, his, experiments, because, of, world, war, i, and, in, 1921, he, wrote, four, papers, about, his, work, carried, out, in, bucharest, and, his, tests, on, a, diabetic, dog, later, that, year, he, published, research, on, the, role, of, the, pancreas, in, food, assimilation, the, name, insulin, was, coined, by, edward, albert, sharpey, schafer, in, 1916, for, a, hypothetical, molecule, produced, by, pancreatic, islets, of, langerhans, latin, insula, for, islet, or, island, that, controls, glucose, metabolism, unbeknown, to, sharpey, schafer, jean, de, meyer, had, introduced, the, very, similar, word, insuline, in, 1909, for, the, same, molecule, in, october, 1920, canadian, frederick, banting, concluded, that, the, digestive, secretions, that, minkowski, had, originally, studied, were, breaking, down, the, islet, secretion, thereby, making, it, impossible, to, extract, successfully, a, surgeon, by, training, banting, knew, that, blockages, of, the, pancreatic, duct, would, lead, most, of, the, pancreas, to, atrophy, while, leaving, the, islets, of, langerhans, intact, he, reasoned, that, a, relatively, pure, extract, could, be, made, from, the, islets, once, most, of, the, rest, of, the, pancreas, was, gone, he, jotted, a, note, to, himself, ligate, pancreatic, ducts, of, dog, keep, dogs, alive, till, acini, degenerate, leaving, islets, try, to, isolate, the, internal, secretion, of, these, relieve, glycosurea, in, the, spring, of, 1921, banting, traveled, to, toronto, to, explain, his, idea, to, john, macleod, professor, of, physiology, at, the, university, of, toronto, macleod, was, initially, skeptical, since, banting, had, no, background, in, research, and, was, not, familiar, with, the, latest, literature, but, he, agreed, to, provide, lab, space, for, banting, to, test, out, his, ideas, macleod, also, arranged, for, two, undergraduates, to, be, banting, s, lab, assistants, that, summer, but, banting, required, only, one, lab, assistant, charles, best, and, clark, noble, flipped, a, coin, best, won, the, coin, toss, and, took, the, first, shift, this, proved, unfortunate, for, noble, as, banting, kept, best, for, the, entire, summer, and, eventually, shared, half, his, nobel, prize, money, and, credit, for, the, discovery, with, best, on, 30, july, 1921, banting, and, best, successfully, isolated, an, extract, isletin, from, the, islets, of, a, duct, tied, dog, and, injected, it, into, a, diabetic, dog, finding, that, the, extract, reduced, its, blood, sugar, by, 40, in, 1, hour, banting, and, best, presented, their, results, to, macleod, on, his, return, to, toronto, in, the, fall, of, 1921, but, macleod, pointed, out, flaws, with, the, experimental, design, and, suggested, the, experiments, be, repeated, with, more, dogs, and, better, equipment, he, moved, banting, and, best, into, a, better, laboratory, and, began, paying, banting, a, salary, from, his, research, grants, several, weeks, later, the, second, round, of, experiments, was, also, a, success, and, macleod, helped, publish, their, results, privately, in, toronto, that, november, bottlenecked, by, the, time, consuming, task, of, duct, tying, dogs, and, waiting, several, weeks, to, extract, insulin, banting, hit, upon, the, idea, of, extracting, insulin, from, the, fetal, calf, pancreas, which, had, not, yet, developed, digestive, glands, by, december, they, had, also, succeeded, in, extracting, insulin, from, the, adult, cow, pancreas, macleod, discontinued, all, other, research, in, his, laboratory, to, concentrate, on, the, purification, of, insulin, he, invited, biochemist, james, collip, to, help, with, this, task, and, the, team, felt, ready, for, a, clinical, test, within, a, month, on, 11, january, 1922, leonard, thompson, a, 14, year, old, diabetic, who, lay, dying, at, the, toronto, general, hospital, was, given, the, first, injection, of, insulin, however, the, extract, was, so, impure, that, thompson, had, a, severe, allergic, reaction, and, further, injections, were, cancelled, over, the, next, 12, days, collip, worked, day, and, night, to, improve, the, ox, pancreas, extract, a, second, dose, was, injected, on, 23, january, eliminating, the, glycosuria, that, was, typical, of, diabetes, without, causing, any, obvious, side, effects, the, first, american, patient, was, elizabeth, hughes, the, daughter, of, u, s, secretary, of, state, charles, evans, hughes, the, first, patient, treated, in, the, u, s, was, future, woodcut, artist, james, d, havens, john, ralston, williams, imported, insulin, from, toronto, to, rochester, new, york, to, treat, havens, banting, and, best, never, worked, well, with, collip, regarding, him, as, something, of, an, interloper, and, collip, left, the, project, soon, after, over, the, spring, of, 1922, best, managed, to, improve, his, techniques, to, the, point, where, large, quantities, of, insulin, could, be, extracted, on, demand, but, the, preparation, remained, impure, the, drug, firm, eli, lilly, and, company, had, offered, assistance, not, long, after, the, first, publications, in, 1921, and, they, took, lilly, up, on, the, offer, in, april, in, november, lilly, s, head, chemist, george, b, walden, discovered, isoelectric, precipitation, and, was, able, to, produce, large, quantities, of, highly, refined, insulin, shortly, thereafter, insulin, was, offered, for, sale, to, the, general, public, toward, the, end, of, january, 1922, tensions, mounted, between, the, four, co, discoverers, of, insulin, and, collip, briefly, threatened, to, separately, patent, his, purification, process, john, g, fitzgerald, director, of, the, non, commercial, public, health, institution, connaught, laboratories, therefore, stepped, in, as, peacemaker, the, resulting, agreement, of, 25, january, 1922, established, two, key, conditions, 1, that, the, collaborators, would, sign, a, contract, agreeing, not, to, take, out, a, patent, with, a, commercial, pharmaceutical, firm, during, an, initial, working, period, with, connaught, and, 2, that, no, changes, in, research, policy, would, be, allowed, unless, first, discussed, among, fitzgerald, and, the, four, collaborators, it, helped, contain, disagreement, and, tied, the, research, to, connaught, s, public, mandate, initially, macleod, and, banting, were, particularly, reluctant, to, patent, their, process, for, insulin, on, grounds, of, medical, ethics, however, concerns, remained, that, a, private, third, party, would, hijack, and, monopolize, the, research, as, eli, lilly, and, company, had, hinted, and, that, safe, distribution, would, be, difficult, to, guarantee, without, capacity, for, quality, control, to, this, end, edward, calvin, kendall, gave, valuable, advice, he, had, isolated, thyroxin, at, the, mayo, clinic, in, 1914, and, patented, the, process, through, an, arrangement, between, himself, the, brothers, mayo, and, the, university, of, minnesota, transferring, the, patent, to, the, public, university, on, 12, april, banting, best, collip, macleod, and, fitzgerald, wrote, jointly, to, the, president, of, the, university, of, toronto, to, propose, a, similar, arrangement, with, the, aim, of, assigning, a, patent, to, the, board, of, governors, of, the, university, the, letter, emphasized, that, the, patent, would, not, be, used, for, any, other, purpose, than, to, prevent, the, taking, out, of, a, patent, by, other, persons, when, the, details, of, the, method, of, preparation, are, published, anyone, would, be, free, to, prepare, the, extract, but, no, one, could, secure, a, profitable, monopoly, the, assignment, to, the, university, of, toronto, board, of, governors, was, completed, on, 15, january, 1923, for, the, token, payment, of, 1, 00, the, arrangement, was, congratulated, in, the, world, s, work, in, 1923, as, a, step, forward, in, medical, ethics, it, has, also, received, much, media, attention, in, the, 2010s, regarding, the, issue, of, healthcare, and, drug, affordability, following, further, concern, regarding, eli, lilly, s, attempts, to, separately, patent, parts, of, the, manufacturing, process, connaught, s, assistant, director, and, head, of, the, insulin, division, robert, defries, established, a, patent, pooling, policy, which, would, require, producers, to, freely, share, any, improvements, to, the, manufacturing, process, without, compromising, affordability, purified, animal, sourced, insulin, was, initially, the, only, type, of, insulin, available, for, experiments, and, diabetics, john, jacob, abel, was, the, first, to, produce, the, crystallised, form, in, 1926, evidence, of, the, protein, nature, was, first, given, by, michael, somogyi, edward, a, doisy, and, philip, a, shaffer, in, 1924, it, was, fully, proven, when, hans, jensen, and, earl, a, evans, jr, isolated, the, amino, acids, phenylalanine, and, proline, in, 1935, the, amino, acid, structure, of, insulin, was, first, characterized, in, 1951, by, frederick, sanger, and, the, first, synthetic, insulin, was, produced, simultaneously, in, the, labs, of, panayotis, katsoyannis, at, the, university, of, pittsburgh, and, helmut, zahn, at, rwth, aachen, university, in, the, mid, 1960s, synthetic, crystalline, bovine, insulin, was, achieved, by, chinese, researchers, in, 1965, the, complete, 3, dimensional, structure, of, insulin, was, determined, by, x, ray, crystallography, in, dorothy, hodgkin, s, laboratory, in, 1969, hans, e, weber, discovered, preproinsulin, while, working, as, a, research, fellow, at, the, university, of, california, los, angeles, in, 1974, in, 1973, 1974, weber, learned, the, techniques, of, how, to, isolate, purify, and, translate, messenger, rna, to, further, investigate, insulin, he, obtained, pancreatic, tissues, from, a, slaughterhouse, in, los, angeles, and, then, later, from, animal, stock, at, ucla, he, isolated, and, purified, total, messenger, rna, from, pancreatic, islet, cells, which, was, then, translated, in, oocytes, from, xenopus, laevis, and, precipitated, using, anti, insulin, antibodies, when, total, translated, protein, was, run, on, an, sds, polyacrylamide, gel, electrophoresis, and, sucrose, gradient, peaks, corresponding, to, insulin, and, proinsulin, were, isolated, however, to, the, surprise, of, weber, a, third, peak, was, isolated, corresponding, to, a, molecule, larger, than, proinsulin, after, reproducing, the, experiment, several, times, he, consistently, noted, this, large, peak, prior, to, proinsulin, that, he, determined, must, be, a, larger, precursor, molecule, upstream, of, proinsulin, in, may, 1975, at, the, american, diabetes, association, meeting, in, new, york, weber, gave, an, oral, presentation, of, his, work, where, he, was, the, first, to, name, this, precursor, molecule, preproinsulin, following, this, oral, presentation, weber, was, invited, to, dinner, to, discuss, his, paper, and, findings, by, donald, steiner, a, researcher, who, contributed, to, the, characterization, of, proinsulin, a, year, later, in, april, 1976, this, molecule, was, further, characterized, and, sequenced, by, steiner, referencing, the, work, and, discovery, of, hans, weber, preproinsulin, became, an, important, molecule, to, study, the, process, of, transcription, and, translation, the, first, genetically, engineered, synthetic, human, insulin, was, produced, using, e, coli, in, 1978, by, arthur, riggs, and, keiichi, itakura, at, the, beckman, research, institute, of, the, city, of, hope, in, collaboration, with, herbert, boyer, at, genentech, genentech, founded, by, swanson, boyer, and, eli, lilly, and, company, went, on, in, 1982, to, sell, the, first, commercially, available, biosynthetic, human, insulin, under, the, brand, name, humulin, the, vast, majority, of, insulin, used, worldwide, is, biosynthetic, recombinant, human, insulin, or, its, analogues, recently, another, approach, has, been, used, by, a, pioneering, group, of, canadian, researchers, using, an, easily, grown, safflower, plant, for, the, production, of, much, cheaper, insulin, recombinant, insulin, is, produced, either, in, yeast, usually, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, or, e, coli, in, yeast, insulin, may, be, engineered, as, a, single, chain, protein, with, a, kexii, endoprotease, a, yeast, homolog, of, pci, pcii, site, that, separates, the, insulin, a, chain, from, a, c, terminally, truncated, insulin, b, chain, a, chemically, synthesized, c, terminal, tail, is, then, grafted, onto, insulin, by, reverse, proteolysis, using, the, inexpensive, protease, trypsin, typically, the, lysine, on, the, c, terminal, tail, is, protected, with, a, chemical, protecting, group, to, prevent, proteolysis, the, ease, of, modular, synthesis, and, the, relative, safety, of, modifications, in, that, region, accounts, for, common, insulin, analogs, with, c, terminal, modifications, e, g, lispro, aspart, glulisine, the, genentech, synthesis, and, completely, chemical, synthesis, such, as, that, by, bruce, merrifield, are, not, preferred, because, the, efficiency, of, recombining, the, two, insulin, chains, is, low, primarily, due, to, competition, with, the, precipitation, of, insulin, b, chain, the, nobel, prize, committee, in, 1923, credited, the, practical, extraction, of, insulin, to, a, team, at, the, university, of, toronto, and, awarded, the, nobel, prize, to, two, men, frederick, banting, and, john, macleod, they, were, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1923, for, the, discovery, of, insulin, banting, incensed, that, best, was, not, mentioned, shared, his, prize, with, him, and, macleod, immediately, shared, his, with, james, collip, the, patent, for, insulin, was, sold, to, the, university, of, toronto, for, one, dollar, two, other, nobel, prizes, have, been, awarded, for, work, on, insulin, british, molecular, biologist, frederick, sanger, who, determined, the, primary, structure, of, insulin, in, 1955, was, awarded, the, 1958, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, rosalyn, sussman, yalow, received, the, 1977, nobel, prize, in, medicine, for, the, development, of, the,
