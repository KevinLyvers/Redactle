a, nut, is, a, fruit, consisting, of, a, hard, or, tough, nutshell, protecting, a, kernel, which, is, usually, edible, in, general, usage, and, in, a, culinary, sense, many, dry, seeds, are, called, nuts, in, a, botanical, context, nut, implies, that, the, shell, does, not, open, to, release, the, seed, indehiscent, most, seeds, come, from, fruits, that, naturally, free, themselves, from, the, shell, but, this, is, not, the, case, in, nuts, such, as, hazelnuts, chestnuts, and, acorns, which, have, hard, shell, walls, and, originate, from, a, compound, ovary, the, general, and, original, usage, of, the, term, is, less, restrictive, and, many, nuts, in, the, culinary, sense, such, as, almonds, pistachios, and, brazil, nuts, are, not, nuts, in, a, botanical, sense, common, usage, of, the, term, often, refers, to, any, hard, walled, edible, kernel, as, a, nut, nuts, are, an, energy, dense, and, nutrient, rich, food, source, a, seed, is, the, mature, fertilised, ovule, of, a, plant, it, consists, of, three, parts, the, embryo, which, will, develop, into, a, new, plant, stored, food, for, the, embryo, and, a, protective, seed, coat, botanically, a, nut, is, a, fruit, with, a, woody, pericarp, developing, from, a, syncarpous, gynoecium, nuts, may, be, contained, in, an, involucre, a, cup, shaped, structure, formed, from, the, flower, bracts, the, involucre, may, be, scaly, spiny, leafy, or, tubular, depending, on, the, species, of, nut, most, nuts, come, from, the, pistils, with, inferior, ovaries, see, flower, and, all, are, indehiscent, not, opening, at, maturity, true, nuts, are, produced, for, example, by, some, plant, families, of, the, order, fagales, these, include, beech, fagus, chestnut, castanea, oak, quercus, stone, oak, lithocarpus, and, tanoak, notholithocarpus, in, the, family, fagaceae, as, well, as, hazel, filbert, corylus, and, hornbeam, carpinus, in, the, family, betulaceae, also, widely, known, as, nuts, are, dry, drupes, which, include, pecans, carya, illinoensis, almonds, prunus, amygdalus, macadamia, macadamia, integrifolia, candlenut, aleurites, moluccanus, and, the, water, caltrop, trapa, bicornis, a, drupe, is, an, indehiscent, fruit, that, has, an, outer, fleshy, part, consisting, of, the, exocarp, or, skin, and, mesocarp, or, flesh, which, surround, a, single, pit, or, stone, the, endocarp, with, a, seed, kernel, inside, in, a, dry, drupe, the, outer, parts, dry, up, and, the, remaining, husk, is, part, of, the, ovary, wall, or, pericarp, and, the, hard, inner, wall, surrounding, the, seed, represents, the, inner, part, of, the, pericarp, a, small, nut, may, be, called, a, nutlet, formerly, called, a, nucule, a, term, otherwise, referring, to, the, oogonium, of, stoneworts, in, botany, the, term, nutlet, can, be, used, to, describe, a, pyrena, or, pyrene, which, is, a, seed, covered, by, a, stony, layer, such, as, the, kernel, of, a, drupe, walnuts, and, hickories, juglandaceae, have, fruits, that, are, difficult, to, classify, they, are, considered, to, be, nuts, under, some, definitions, but, are, also, referred, to, as, drupaceous, nuts, in, common, use, a, tree, nut, is, as, the, name, implies, any, nut, coming, from, a, tree, this, most, often, comes, up, regarding, food, allergies, a, person, may, be, allergic, specifically, to, peanuts, which, are, not, tree, nuts, but, legumes, whereas, others, may, be, allergic, to, the, wider, range, of, nuts, that, grow, on, trees, in, the, 21st, century, about, a, dozen, species, constitute, most, of, the, worldwide, production, of, nuts, shown, in, the, table, below, for, major, commercial, nuts, nuts, used, for, food, are, a, common, source, of, food, allergens, reactions, can, range, from, mild, symptoms, to, severe, ones, a, condition, known, as, anaphylaxis, which, can, be, life, threatening, the, reaction, is, due, to, the, release, of, histamine, by, the, body, in, response, to, an, allergen, in, the, nuts, causing, skin, and, other, possible, reactions, many, experts, suggest, that, a, person, with, an, allergy, to, peanuts, should, avoid, eating, tree, nuts, and, vice, versa, nuts, contain, the, diverse, nutrients, that, are, needed, for, the, growth, of, a, new, plant, composition, varies, but, they, tend, to, have, a, low, water, and, carbohydrate, content, with, high, levels, of, fats, protein, dietary, minerals, and, vitamins, the, digestibility, of, the, protein, at, about, 90, is, slightly, lower, than, that, of, meat, and, fish, but, can, be, improved, by, chewing, thoroughly, the, fats, are, largely, unsaturated, and, nuts, are, a, source, of, essential, omega, 3, fatty, acids, as, part, of, a, healthy, human, diet, long, term, consumption, of, diverse, nutrients, in, nuts, may, contribute, to, a, lower, risk, of, cardiovascular, diseases, reduced, levels, of, blood, cholesterol, and, lower, all, cause, mortality, for, vegetarians, and, vegans, nuts, provide, many, of, the, essential, nutrients, which, may, be, in, short, supply, in, other, plant, foods, nuts, supply, nutrients, for, humans, and, wildlife, because, nuts, generally, have, a, high, oil, content, they, are, a, significant, energy, source, many, seeds, are, edible, by, humans, and, used, in, cooking, eaten, raw, sprouted, or, roasted, as, a, snack, food, ground, to, make, nut, butters, or, pressed, for, oil, that, is, used, in, cooking, and, cosmetics, regular, nut, consumption, of, more, than, 5, ounces, 140, g, per, week, may, benefit, weight, control, and, contribute, to, lowering, body, weight, in, humans, nuts, are, the, source, of, energy, and, nutrients, for, the, new, plant, they, contain, a, relatively, large, quantity, of, calories, essential, unsaturated, and, monounsaturated, fats, including, linoleic, acid, and, linolenic, acid, vitamins, and, essential, amino, acids, many, nuts, are, good, sources, of, vitamin, e, vitamin, b, 2, folate, fiber, and, essential, minerals, such, as, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, copper, and, selenium, this, table, lists, the, percentage, of, various, nutrients, in, four, unroasted, seeds, nuts, are, under, preliminary, research, to, assess, whether, their, consumption, is, associated, with, lower, risk, for, some, diseases, such, as, cardiovascular, diseases, and, cancer, a, 2014, review, indicated, that, consuming, one, or, more, servings, of, nuts, or, peanut, butter, per, day, was, associated, with, lower, risk, of, ischemic, heart, disease, overall, cardiovascular, disease, stroke, in, women, and, all, cause, mortality, a, 2022, umbrella, review, confirmed, these, findings, and, found, a, 22, reduction, in, all, cause, mortality, further, reading
