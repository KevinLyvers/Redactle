the, giant, panda, ailuropoda, melanoleuca, also, known, as, the, panda, bear, or, simply, panda, is, a, bear, species, endemic, to, china, it, is, characterised, by, its, white, coat, with, black, patches, around, the, eyes, ears, legs, and, shoulders, its, body, is, rotund, adult, individuals, weigh, 100, to, 115, kg, 220, to, 254, lb, and, are, typically, 1, 2, to, 1, 9, m, 3, ft, 11, in, to, 6, ft, 3, in, long, it, is, sexually, dimorphic, with, males, being, typically, 10, to, 20, larger, than, females, a, thumb, is, visible, on, its, forepaw, which, helps, in, holding, bamboo, in, place, for, feeding, it, has, large, molar, teeth, and, expanded, temporal, fossa, to, meet, its, dietary, requirements, it, can, digest, starch, and, is, mostly, herbivorous, with, a, diet, consisting, almost, entirely, of, bamboo, and, bamboo, shoots, the, giant, panda, lives, exclusively, in, six, montane, regions, in, a, few, chinese, provinces, at, elevations, of, up, to, 3, 000, m, 9, 800, ft, it, is, solitary, and, gathers, only, in, mating, seasons, it, relies, on, olfactory, communication, to, communicate, and, uses, scent, marks, as, chemical, cues, and, on, landmarks, like, rocks, or, trees, females, rear, cubs, for, an, average, of, 18, to, 24, months, the, oldest, known, giant, panda, was, 38, years, old, as, a, result, of, farming, deforestation, and, infrastructural, development, the, giant, panda, has, been, driven, out, of, the, lowland, areas, where, it, once, lived, the, wild, population, has, increased, again, to, 1, 864, individuals, as, of, march, 2015, since, 2016, it, has, been, listed, as, vulnerable, on, the, iucn, red, list, in, july, 2021, chinese, authorities, also, classified, the, giant, panda, as, vulnerable, it, is, a, conservation, reliant, species, by, 2007, the, captive, population, comprised, 239, giant, pandas, in, china, and, another, 27, outside, the, country, it, has, often, served, as, china, s, national, symbol, appeared, on, chinese, gold, panda, coins, since, 1982, and, as, one, of, the, five, fuwa, mascots, of, the, 2008, summer, olympics, held, in, beijing, the, word, panda, was, borrowed, into, english, from, french, but, no, conclusive, explanation, of, the, origin, of, the, french, word, panda, has, been, found, the, closest, candidate, is, the, nepali, word, ponya, possibly, referring, to, the, adapted, wrist, bone, of, the, red, panda, which, is, native, to, nepal, in, many, older, sources, the, name, panda, or, common, panda, refers, to, the, red, panda, ailurus, fulgens, which, was, described, some, 40, years, earlier, and, over, that, period, was, the, only, animal, known, as, a, panda, the, binomial, name, ailuropoda, melanoleuca, means, black, and, white, melanoleuca, cat, foot, ailuropoda, since, the, earliest, collection, of, chinese, writings, the, chinese, language, has, given, the, bear, many, different, names, including, m, ancient, chinese, name, for, giant, panda, hu, xi, ng, spotted, bear, and, zh, xi, ng, bamboo, bear, the, most, popular, names, in, china, today, are, d, xi, ngm, o, lit, giant, bear, cat, or, simply, xi, ngm, o, lit, bear, cat, as, with, the, word, panda, in, english, xi, ngm, o, was, originally, used, to, describe, just, the, red, panda, but, d, xi, ngm, o, and, xi, oxi, ngm, o, lit, little, bear, cat, were, coined, to, differentiate, between, the, species, in, taiwan, another, popular, name, for, panda, is, the, inverted, d, m, oxi, ng, lit, giant, cat, bear, though, many, encyclopedias, and, dictionaries, in, taiwan, still, use, the, bear, cat, form, as, the, correct, name, some, linguists, argue, in, this, construction, bear, instead, of, cat, is, the, base, noun, making, the, name, more, grammatically, and, logically, correct, which, have, led, to, the, popular, choice, despite, official, writings, this, name, did, not, gain, its, popularity, until, 1988, when, a, private, zoo, in, tainan, painted, a, sun, bear, black, and, white, and, created, the, tainan, fake, panda, incident, for, many, decades, the, precise, taxonomic, classification, of, the, giant, panda, was, under, debate, because, it, shares, characteristics, with, both, bears, and, raccoons, in, 1985, molecular, studies, indicated, that, the, giant, panda, is, a, true, bear, part, of, the, family, ursidae, these, studies, show, it, diverged, about, 19, million, years, ago, from, the, common, ancestor, of, the, ursidae, it, is, the, most, basal, member, of, this, family, and, equidistant, from, all, other, extant, bear, species, two, subspecies, of, giant, panda, have, been, recognized, on, the, basis, of, distinct, cranial, measurements, colour, patterns, and, population, genetics, a, detailed, study, of, the, giant, panda, s, genetic, history, from, 2012, confirms, that, the, separation, of, the, qinling, population, occurred, about, 300, 000, years, ago, and, reveals, that, the, non, qinling, population, further, diverged, into, two, groups, named, the, minshan, and, the, qionglai, daxiangling, xiaoxiangling, liangshan, group, respectively, about, 2, 800, years, ago, of, the, eight, extant, species, in, the, bear, family, ursidae, the, giant, panda, s, lineage, branched, off, the, earliest, giant, panda, ailuropoda, melanoleuca, spectacled, bear, tremarctos, ornatus, ursinae, black, brown, sloth, sun, and, polar, bears, the, giant, panda, is, endemic, to, china, it, is, found, in, small, fragmented, populations, in, six, mountainous, regions, in, the, country, mainly, in, sichuan, and, also, in, neighbouring, shaanxi, and, gansu, successful, habitat, preservation, has, seen, a, rise, in, panda, numbers, though, loss, of, habitat, due, to, human, activities, remains, its, biggest, threat, in, areas, with, a, high, concentration, of, medium, to, large, sized, mammals, such, as, domestic, cattle, a, species, known, to, degrade, the, landscape, the, giant, panda, population, is, generally, low, this, is, mainly, attributed, to, the, panda, s, avoidance, of, interspecific, competition, the, species, have, been, located, at, elevations, of, 2, 400, to, 3, 000, m, 7, 900, to, 9, 800, ft, above, sea, level, they, frequent, habitats, with, a, healthy, concentration, of, bamboos, typically, old, growth, forests, but, may, also, venture, into, secondary, forest, habitats, the, daxiangling, mountain, population, inhabits, both, coniferous, and, broadleaf, forests, giant, pandas, once, roamed, across, southeast, asia, from, myanmar, to, northern, vietnam, their, range, in, china, spanned, much, of, the, southeast, region, by, the, pleistocene, climate, change, affected, panda, populations, and, the, subsequent, domination, of, modern, humans, led, to, large, scale, habitat, loss, in, 2001, it, was, estimated, that, the, range, of, the, giant, panda, had, declined, by, about, 99, of, its, range, in, earlier, millenniums, the, giant, panda, has, a, body, shape, typical, of, bears, it, has, black, fur, on, its, ears, limbs, shoulders, and, around, the, eyes, the, rest, of, the, animal, s, coat, is, white, the, bear, s, distinctive, coloration, appears, to, serve, as, camouflage, in, both, winter, and, summer, environments, as, they, do, not, hibernate, the, white, areas, serve, as, camouflage, in, snow, while, the, black, shoulders, and, legs, conceal, them, in, shade, studies, in, the, wild, have, found, that, when, viewed, from, a, distance, the, panda, displays, disruptive, coloration, while, up, close, they, rely, more, on, blending, in, the, black, ears, may, be, used, to, display, aggression, while, the, eye, patches, might, facilitate, them, identifying, one, another, the, giant, panda, s, thick, woolly, coat, keeps, it, warm, in, the, cool, forests, of, its, habitat, the, panda, s, skull, shape, is, typical, of, durophagous, carnivorans, it, has, evolved, from, previous, ancestors, to, exhibit, larger, molars, with, increased, complexity, and, expanded, temporal, fossa, a, study, revealed, that, a, 117, 5, kg, 259, lb, giant, panda, had, a, biteforce, of, 1298, 9, newton, bfq, 151, 4, at, canine, teeth, and, 1815, 9, newton, bfq, 141, 8, at, carnassial, teeth, adults, measure, around, 1, 2, to, 1, 9, m, 3, ft, 11, in, to, 6, ft, 3, in, long, including, a, tail, of, about, 10, 15, cm, 3, 9, 5, 9, in, and, 60, to, 90, cm, 24, to, 35, in, tall, at, the, shoulder, males, can, weigh, up, to, 160, kg, 350, lb, females, are, generally, 10, 20, smaller, than, males, they, weigh, between, 70, kg, 150, lb, and, 125, kg, 276, lb, the, average, weight, for, adults, is, 100, to, 115, kg, 220, to, 254, lb, the, giant, panda, s, paw, has, a, digit, similar, to, a, thumb, and, five, fingers, the, thumb, like, digit, actually, a, modified, sesamoid, bone, helps, it, to, hold, bamboo, while, eating, the, giant, panda, s, tail, measuring, 10, to, 15, cm, 3, 9, to, 5, 9, in, is, the, second, longest, in, the, bear, family, behind, the, sloth, bear, despite, its, taxonomic, classification, as, a, carnivoran, the, giant, panda, s, diet, is, primarily, herbivorous, with, approximately, 99, of, its, diet, consisting, of, bamboo, however, the, giant, panda, still, has, the, digestive, system, of, a, carnivore, as, well, as, carnivore, specific, genes, and, thus, derives, little, energy, and, little, protein, from, consumption, of, bamboo, the, ability, to, break, down, cellulose, and, lignin, is, very, weak, and, their, main, source, of, nutrients, comes, from, starch, and, hemicelluloses, the, most, important, part, of, their, bamboo, diet, is, the, shoots, that, are, rich, in, starch, and, have, up, to, 32, protein, content, accordingly, pandas, have, evolved, a, higher, capability, to, digest, starches, than, strict, carnivores, raw, bamboo, is, toxic, containing, cyanide, compounds, pandas, body, tissues, are, less, able, than, herbivores, to, detoxify, cyanide, but, their, gut, microbiomes, are, significantly, enriched, in, putative, genes, coding, for, enzymes, related, to, cyanide, degradation, suggesting, that, they, have, cyanide, digesting, gut, microbes, it, has, been, estimated, that, an, adult, panda, absorbs, 54, 8, 66, 1, mg, 0, 846, 1, 020, gr, of, cyanide, a, day, through, its, diet, to, prevent, poisoning, they, have, evolved, anti, toxic, mechanisms, to, protect, themselves, about, 80, of, the, cyanide, is, metabolized, to, less, toxic, thiocyanate, and, discharged, in, urine, while, the, remaining, 20, is, detoxified, by, other, minor, pathways, during, the, shoot, season, april, august, pandas, store, a, large, amount, of, food, in, preparation, for, the, months, succeeding, this, seasonal, period, in, which, pandas, live, off, a, diet, of, bamboo, leaves, the, giant, panda, is, a, highly, specialised, animal, with, unique, adaptations, and, has, lived, in, bamboo, forests, for, millions, of, years, the, average, giant, panda, eats, as, much, as, 9, to, 14, kg, 20, to, 31, lb, of, bamboo, shoots, a, day, to, compensate, for, the, limited, energy, content, of, its, diet, ingestion, of, such, a, large, quantity, of, material, is, possible, and, necessary, because, of, the, rapid, passage, of, large, amounts, of, indigestible, plant, material, through, the, short, straight, digestive, tract, it, is, also, noted, however, that, such, rapid, passage, of, digesta, limits, the, potential, of, microbial, digestion, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, limiting, alternative, forms, of, digestion, given, this, voluminous, diet, the, giant, panda, defecates, up, to, 40, times, a, day, the, limited, energy, input, imposed, on, it, by, its, diet, has, affected, the, panda, s, behavior, the, giant, panda, tends, to, limit, its, social, interactions, and, avoids, steeply, sloping, terrain, to, limit, its, energy, expenditures, two, of, the, panda, s, most, distinctive, features, its, large, size, and, round, face, are, adaptations, to, its, bamboo, diet, anthropologist, russell, ciochon, observed, like, the, vegetarian, gorilla, the, low, body, surface, area, to, body, volume, is, indicative, of, a, lower, metabolic, rate, this, lower, metabolic, rate, and, a, more, sedentary, lifestyle, allows, the, giant, panda, to, subsist, on, nutrient, poor, resources, such, as, bamboo, the, giant, panda, s, round, face, is, the, result, of, powerful, jaw, muscles, which, attach, from, the, top, of, the, head, to, the, jaw, large, molars, crush, and, grind, fibrous, plant, material, the, morphological, characteristics, of, extinct, relatives, of, the, giant, panda, suggest, that, while, the, ancient, giant, panda, was, omnivorous, 7, million, years, ago, mya, it, only, became, herbivorous, some, 2, 2, 4, mya, with, the, emergence, of, a, microta, genome, sequencing, of, the, giant, panda, suggests, that, the, dietary, switch, could, have, initiated, from, the, loss, of, the, sole, umami, taste, receptor, encoded, by, the, genes, tas1r1, and, tas1r3, also, known, as, t1r1, and, t1r3, resulting, from, two, frameshift, mutations, within, the, t1r1, exons, umami, taste, corresponds, to, high, levels, of, glutamate, as, found, in, meat, and, may, have, thus, altered, the, food, choice, of, the, giant, panda, although, the, pseudogenisation, conversion, into, a, pseudogene, of, the, umami, taste, receptor, in, ailuropoda, coincides, with, the, dietary, switch, to, herbivory, it, is, likely, a, result, of, and, not, the, reason, for, the, dietary, change, the, mutation, time, for, the, t1r1, gene, in, the, giant, panda, is, estimated, to, 4, 2, mya, while, fossil, evidence, indicates, bamboo, consumption, in, the, giant, panda, species, at, least, 7, mya, signifying, that, although, complete, herbivory, occurred, around, 2, mya, the, dietary, switch, was, initiated, prior, to, t1r1, loss, of, function, pandas, eat, any, of, 25, bamboo, species, in, the, wild, with, the, most, common, including, fargesia, dracocephala, and, fargesia, rufa, only, a, few, bamboo, species, are, widespread, at, the, high, altitudes, pandas, now, inhabit, bamboo, leaves, contain, the, highest, protein, levels, stems, have, less, because, of, the, synchronous, flowering, death, and, regeneration, of, all, bamboo, within, a, species, the, giant, panda, must, have, at, least, two, different, species, available, in, its, range, to, avoid, starvation, while, primarily, herbivorous, the, giant, panda, still, retains, decidedly, ursine, teeth, and, will, eat, meat, fish, and, eggs, when, available, in, captivity, zoos, typically, maintain, the, giant, panda, s, bamboo, diet, though, some, will, provide, specially, formulated, biscuits, or, other, dietary, supplements, pandas, will, travel, between, different, habitats, if, they, need, to, so, they, can, get, the, nutrients, that, they, need, and, to, balance, their, diet, for, reproduction, although, adult, giant, pandas, have, few, natural, predators, other, than, humans, young, cubs, are, vulnerable, to, attacks, by, snow, leopards, yellow, throated, martens, eagles, feral, dogs, and, the, asian, black, bear, sub, adults, weighing, up, to, 50, kg, 110, lb, may, be, vulnerable, to, predation, by, leopards, giant, pandas, are, sympatric, with, other, large, mammals, and, bamboo, feeders, such, as, the, takin, budorcas, taxicolor, the, takin, and, giant, panda, share, a, similar, ecological, niche, and, they, consume, the, same, resources, when, competition, for, food, is, fierce, pandas, disperse, to, the, outskirts, of, takin, distribution, other, possible, competitors, include, but, is, not, limited, to, the, eurasian, wild, pig, sus, scrofa, chinese, goral, naemorhedus, griseus, and, the, asian, black, bear, ursus, thibetanus, giant, pandas, avoid, areas, with, a, mid, to, high, density, of, livestock, as, they, depress, the, vegetation, the, tibetan, plateau, is, the, only, known, area, where, both, giant, and, red, pandas, can, be, found, although, sharing, near, identical, ecological, niches, competition, between, the, two, species, has, rarely, been, observed, nearly, 50, of, their, respective, distribution, overlaps, and, successful, coexistence, is, achieved, through, distinct, habitat, selection, they, alter, their, behavioral, patterns, to, feeding, at, dawn, till, the, early, twilight, stages, a, captive, female, died, from, toxoplasmosis, a, disease, caused, by, an, obligate, intracellular, parasitic, protozoan, known, as, toxoplasma, gondii, that, infects, most, warm, blooded, animals, including, humans, they, are, likely, susceptible, to, diseases, from, baylisascaris, schroederi, a, parasitic, nematode, known, to, infect, giant, panda, intestines, this, nematode, species, is, known, to, give, pandas, baylisascariasi, a, deadly, disease, that, kills, more, wild, pandas, than, any, other, cause, additionally, the, population, is, threatened, by, canine, distemper, virus, cdv, canine, parvovirus, rotavirus, canine, adenovirus, and, canine, coronavirus, bacteria, such, as, clostridium, welchii, proteus, mirabilis, klebsiella, pneumoniae, and, escherichia, coli, may, also, be, lethal, the, giant, panda, is, a, terrestrial, animal, and, primarily, spends, its, life, roaming, and, feeding, in, the, bamboo, forests, of, the, qinling, mountains, and, in, the, hilly, province, of, sichuan, giant, pandas, are, generally, solitary, each, adult, has, a, defined, territory, and, a, female, is, not, tolerant, of, other, females, in, her, range, social, encounters, occur, primarily, during, the, brief, breeding, season, in, which, pandas, in, proximity, to, one, another, will, gather, after, mating, the, male, leaves, the, female, alone, to, raise, the, cub, pandas, were, thought, to, fall, into, the, crepuscular, category, those, who, are, active, twice, a, day, at, dawn, and, dusk, however, pandas, may, belong, to, a, category, all, of, their, own, with, activity, peaks, in, the, morning, afternoon, and, midnight, the, low, nutrition, quality, of, bamboo, means, pandas, need, to, eat, more, frequently, and, due, to, their, lack, of, major, predators, they, can, be, active, at, any, time, of, the, day, activity, is, highest, in, june, and, decreases, in, late, summer, to, autumn, with, an, increase, from, november, through, the, following, march, activity, is, also, directly, related, to, the, amount, of, sunlight, during, colder, days, there, is, a, significant, interaction, of, solar, radiation, such, that, solar, radiation, has, a, stronger, positive, effect, on, activity, levels, of, panda, bears, pandas, communicate, through, vocalisation, and, scent, marking, such, as, clawing, trees, or, spraying, urine, they, are, able, to, climb, and, take, shelter, in, hollow, trees, or, rock, crevices, but, do, not, establish, permanent, dens, for, this, reason, pandas, do, not, hibernate, which, is, similar, to, other, subtropical, mammals, and, will, instead, move, to, elevations, with, warmer, temperatures, pandas, rely, primarily, on, spatial, memory, rather, than, visual, memory, though, the, panda, is, often, assumed, to, be, docile, it, has, been, known, to, attack, humans, on, rare, occasions, pandas, have, been, known, to, cover, themselves, in, horse, manure, to, protect, themselves, against, cold, temperatures, the, species, communicates, foremost, through, a, blatting, sound, they, achieve, peaceful, interactions, through, the, emission, of, this, sound, when, in, oestrus, a, female, emits, a, chirp, in, hostile, confrontations, or, during, fights, the, giant, panda, emits, vocalizations, such, as, a, roar, or, growl, on, the, other, hand, squeals, typically, indicate, inferiority, and, submission, in, a, dispute, other, vocalizations, include, honks, and, moans, giant, pandas, heavily, rely, on, olfactory, communication, to, communicate, with, one, another, scent, marks, are, used, to, spread, these, chemical, cues, and, are, placed, on, landmarks, like, rocks, or, trees, chemical, communication, in, giant, pandas, plays, many, roles, in, their, social, situations, scent, marks, and, odors, are, used, to, spread, information, about, sexual, status, whether, a, female, is, in, estrus, or, not, age, gender, individuality, dominance, over, territory, and, choice, of, settlement, giant, pandas, communicate, by, excreting, volatile, compounds, or, scent, marks, through, the, anogenital, gland, giant, pandas, have, unique, positions, in, which, they, will, scent, mark, males, deposit, scent, marks, or, urine, by, lifting, their, hind, leg, rubbing, their, backside, or, standing, in, order, to, rub, the, anogenital, gland, onto, a, landmark, females, however, exercise, squatting, or, simply, rubbing, their, genitals, onto, a, landmark, the, season, plays, a, major, role, in, mediating, chemical, communication, depending, on, the, season, mainly, whether, it, is, breeding, season, or, not, may, influence, which, odors, are, prioritized, chemical, signals, can, have, different, functions, in, different, seasons, during, the, non, breeding, season, females, prefer, the, odors, of, other, females, because, reproduction, is, not, their, primary, motivation, however, during, breeding, season, odors, from, the, opposite, sex, will, be, more, attractive, because, they, are, solitary, mammals, and, their, breeding, season, is, so, brief, female, pandas, secrete, chemical, cues, in, order, to, let, males, know, their, sexual, status, the, chemical, cues, female, pandas, secrete, can, be, considered, to, be, pheromones, for, sexual, reproduction, females, deposit, scent, marks, through, their, urine, which, induces, an, increase, in, androgen, levels, in, males, androgen, is, a, sex, hormone, found, in, both, males, and, females, testosterone, is, the, major, androgen, produced, by, males, civetone, and, decanoic, acid, are, chemicals, found, in, female, urine, which, promote, behavioral, responses, in, males, both, chemicals, are, considered, giant, panda, pheromones, male, pandas, also, secrete, chemical, signals, that, include, information, about, their, sexual, reproductivity, and, age, which, is, beneficial, for, a, female, when, choosing, a, mate, for, example, age, can, be, useful, for, a, female, to, determine, sexual, maturity, and, sperm, quality, pandas, are, also, able, to, determine, when, the, signal, was, placed, further, aiding, in, the, quest, to, find, a, potential, mate, however, chemical, cues, are, not, just, used, for, communication, between, males, and, females, pandas, can, determine, individuality, from, chemical, signals, this, allows, them, to, be, able, to, differentiate, between, a, potential, partner, or, someone, of, the, same, sex, which, could, be, a, potential, competitor, chemical, cues, or, odors, play, an, important, role, in, how, a, panda, chooses, their, habitat, pandas, look, for, odors, that, tell, them, not, only, the, identity, of, another, panda, but, if, they, should, avoid, them, or, not, pandas, tend, to, avoid, their, species, for, most, of, the, year, breeding, season, being, the, brief, time, of, major, interaction, chemical, signaling, allows, for, avoidance, and, competition, pandas, whose, habitats, are, in, similar, locations, will, collectively, leave, scent, marks, in, a, unique, location, which, is, termed, scent, stations, when, pandas, come, across, these, scent, stations, they, are, able, to, identify, a, specific, panda, and, the, scope, of, their, habitat, this, allows, pandas, to, be, able, to, pursue, a, potential, mate, or, avoid, a, potential, competitor, pandas, can, assess, an, individual, s, dominance, status, including, their, age, and, size, via, odor, cues, and, may, choose, to, avoid, a, scent, mark, if, the, signaler, s, competitive, ability, outweighs, their, own, a, pandas, size, can, be, conveyed, through, the, height, of, the, scent, mark, since, larger, animals, can, place, higher, scent, marks, an, elevated, scent, mark, advertises, a, higher, competitive, ability, age, must, also, be, taken, into, consideration, when, assessing, a, competitor, s, fighting, ability, for, example, a, mature, panda, will, be, larger, than, a, younger, immature, panda, and, possess, an, advantage, during, a, fight, giant, pandas, reach, sexual, maturity, between, the, ages, of, four, and, eight, and, may, be, reproductive, until, age, 20, the, mating, season, is, between, march, and, may, when, a, female, goes, into, estrus, which, lasts, for, two, or, three, days, and, only, occurs, once, a, year, when, mating, the, female, is, in, a, crouching, head, down, position, as, the, male, mounts, her, from, behind, copulation, time, ranges, from, 30, seconds, to, five, minutes, but, the, male, may, mount, her, repeatedly, to, ensure, successful, fertilisation, the, gestation, period, is, somewhere, between, 95, and, 160, days, the, variability, is, due, to, the, fact, that, the, fertilized, egg, may, linger, in, the, reproductive, system, for, a, while, before, implanting, on, the, uterine, wall, giant, pandas, give, birth, to, twins, in, about, half, of, pregnancies, if, twins, are, born, usually, only, one, survives, in, the, wild, the, mother, will, select, the, stronger, of, the, cubs, and, the, weaker, cub, will, die, due, to, starvation, the, mother, is, thought, to, be, unable, to, produce, enough, milk, for, two, cubs, since, she, does, not, store, fat, the, father, has, no, part, in, helping, raise, the, cub, when, the, cub, is, first, born, it, is, pink, blind, and, toothless, weighing, only, 90, to, 130, g, 3, 2, to, 4, 6, oz, or, about, 1, 800, of, the, mother, s, weight, proportionally, the, smallest, baby, of, any, placental, mammal, it, nurses, from, its, mother, s, breast, six, to, 14, times, a, day, for, up, to, 30, minutes, at, a, time, for, three, to, four, hours, the, mother, may, leave, the, den, to, feed, which, leaves, the, cub, defenseless, one, to, two, weeks, after, birth, the, cub, s, skin, turns, grey, where, its, hair, will, eventually, become, black, slight, pink, colour, may, appear, on, the, cub, s, fur, as, a, result, of, a, chemical, reaction, between, the, fur, and, its, mother, s, saliva, a, month, after, birth, the, colour, pattern, of, the, cub, s, fur, is, fully, developed, its, fur, is, very, soft, and, coarsens, with, age, the, cub, begins, to, crawl, at, 75, to, 80, days, mothers, play, with, their, cubs, by, rolling, and, wrestling, with, them, the, cubs, can, eat, small, quantities, of, bamboo, after, six, months, though, mother, s, milk, remains, the, primary, food, source, for, most, of, the, first, year, giant, panda, cubs, weigh, 45, kg, 99, lb, at, one, year, and, live, with, their, mothers, until, they, are, 18, months, to, two, years, old, the, interval, between, births, in, the, wild, is, generally, two, years, initially, the, primary, method, of, breeding, giant, pandas, in, captivity, was, by, artificial, insemination, as, they, seemed, to, lose, their, interest, in, mating, once, they, were, captured, this, led, some, scientists, to, trying, methods, such, as, showing, them, videos, of, giant, pandas, mating, and, giving, the, males, sildenafil, commonly, known, as, viagra, in, the, 2000s, researchers, started, having, success, with, captive, breeding, programs, and, they, have, now, determined, giant, pandas, have, comparable, breeding, to, some, populations, of, the, american, black, bear, a, thriving, bear, species, in, july, 2009, chinese, scientists, confirmed, the, birth, of, the, first, cub, to, be, successfully, conceived, through, artificial, insemination, using, frozen, sperm, the, technique, for, freezing, the, sperm, in, liquid, nitrogen, was, first, developed, in, 1980, and, the, first, birth, was, hailed, as, a, solution, to, the, dwindling, availability, of, giant, panda, semen, which, had, led, to, inbreeding, panda, semen, which, can, be, frozen, for, decades, could, be, shared, between, different, zoos, to, save, the, species, as, of, 2009, it, is, expected, that, zoos, in, destinations, such, as, san, diego, in, the, united, states, and, mexico, city, will, be, able, to, provide, their, own, semen, to, inseminate, more, giant, pandas, attempts, have, also, been, made, to, reproduce, giant, pandas, by, interspecific, pregnancy, where, cloned, panda, embryos, were, implanted, into, the, uterus, of, an, animal, of, another, species, this, has, resulted, in, panda, fetuses, but, no, live, births, in, ancient, china, people, thought, pandas, to, be, rare, and, noble, creatures, the, empress, dowager, bo, was, buried, with, a, panda, skull, in, her, vault, the, grandson, of, emperor, taizong, of, tang, is, said, to, have, given, japan, two, pandas, and, a, sheet, of, panda, skin, as, a, sign, of, goodwill, unlike, many, other, animals, in, ancient, china, pandas, were, rarely, thought, to, have, medical, uses, the, few, known, uses, include, the, sichuan, tribal, peoples, use, of, panda, urine, to, melt, accidentally, swallowed, needles, and, the, use, of, panda, pelts, to, control, menstruation, as, described, in, the, qin, dynasty, encyclopedia, erya, the, creature, named, mo, mentioned, in, some, ancient, books, has, been, interpreted, as, giant, panda, the, dictionary, shuowen, jiezi, eastern, han, dynasty, says, that, the, mo, from, shu, sichuan, is, bear, like, but, yellow, and, black, although, the, older, erya, describes, mo, simply, as, a, white, leopard, the, interpretation, of, the, legendary, fierce, creature, pixiu, as, referring, to, the, giant, panda, is, also, common, during, the, reign, of, the, yongle, emperor, early, 15th, century, his, relative, from, kaifeng, sent, him, a, captured, zouyu, and, another, zouyu, was, sighted, in, shandong, zouyu, is, a, legendary, righteous, animal, which, similarly, to, a, qilin, only, appears, during, the, rule, of, a, benevolent, and, sincere, monarch, pandas, have, been, kept, in, zoos, as, early, as, the, western, han, dynasty, in, china, where, the, writer, sima, xiangru, noted, that, the, panda, was, the, most, treasured, animal, in, the, emperor, s, garden, of, exotic, animals, in, the, capital, chang, an, present, xi, an, not, until, the, 1950s, were, pandas, again, recorded, to, have, been, exhibited, in, china, s, zoos, chi, chi, at, the, london, zoo, became, very, popular, this, influenced, the, world, wildlife, fund, to, use, a, panda, as, its, symbol, a, 2006, new, york, times, article, outlined, the, economics, of, keeping, pandas, which, costs, five, times, more, than, keeping, the, next, most, expensive, animal, an, elephant, american, zoos, generally, pay, the, chinese, government, 1, million, a, year, in, fees, as, part, of, a, typical, ten, year, contract, san, diego, s, contract, with, china, was, to, expire, in, 2008, but, got, a, five, year, extension, at, about, half, of, the, previous, yearly, cost, the, last, contract, with, the, memphis, zoo, in, memphis, tennessee, ended, in, 2013, in, the, 1970s, gifts, of, giant, pandas, to, american, and, japanese, zoos, formed, an, important, part, of, the, diplomacy, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, prc, as, it, marked, some, of, the, first, cultural, exchanges, between, china, and, the, west, this, practice, has, been, termed, panda, diplomacy, by, 1984, however, pandas, were, no, longer, given, as, gifts, instead, china, began, to, offer, pandas, to, other, nations, only, on, 10, year, loans, for, a, fee, of, up, to, us, 1, 000, 000, per, year, and, with, the, provision, that, any, cubs, born, during, the, loan, are, the, property, of, china, as, a, result, of, this, change, in, policy, nearly, all, the, pandas, in, the, world, are, owned, by, china, and, pandas, leased, to, foreign, zoos, and, all, cubs, are, eventually, returned, to, china, as, of, 2022, xin, xin, at, the, chapultepec, zoo, in, mexico, city, was, the, last, living, descendant, of, the, gifted, pandas, since, 1998, because, of, a, wwf, lawsuit, the, united, states, fish, and, wildlife, service, only, allows, us, zoos, to, import, a, panda, if, the, zoo, can, ensure, china, channels, more, than, half, of, its, loan, fee, into, conservation, efforts, for, giant, pandas, and, their, habitat, in, may, 2005, china, offered, a, breeding, pair, to, taiwan, the, issue, became, embroiled, in, cross, strait, relations, due, to, both, the, underlying, symbolism, and, technical, issues, such, as, whether, the, transfer, would, be, considered, domestic, or, international, or, whether, any, true, conservation, purpose, would, be, served, by, the, exchange, a, contest, in, 2006, to, name, the, pandas, was, held, in, the, mainland, resulting, in, the, politically, charged, names, tuan, tuan, and, yuan, yuan, from, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, tuanyuan, lit, reunion, implying, reunification, china, s, offer, was, initially, rejected, by, chen, shui, bian, then, president, of, taiwan, however, when, ma, ying, jeou, assumed, the, presidency, in, 2008, the, offer, was, accepted, and, the, pandas, arrived, in, december, of, that, year, in, the, 2020s, certain, celebrity, pandas, have, gained, a, cult, following, amongst, internet, users, with, dedicated, fan, accounts, existing, to, keep, tabs, on, the, animals, known, as, giant, panda, fever, or, panda, monium, individual, pandas, are, known, to, get, billions, of, views, and, engagements, on, social, media, as, well, as, product, lines, specifically, emulating, them, at, chengdu, research, base, of, giant, panda, breeding, certain, of, these, celebrity, pandas, are, known, to, garner, hours, long, lines, specifically, to, see, them, the, giant, panda, is, a, vulnerable, species, threatened, by, continued, habitat, loss, and, fragmentation, and, by, a, very, low, birthrate, both, in, the, wild, and, in, captivity, its, range, is, confined, to, a, small, portion, on, the, western, edge, of, its, historical, range, which, stretched, through, southern, and, eastern, china, northern, myanmar, and, northern, vietnam, the, species, is, scattered, into, more, than, 30, subpopulations, of, relatively, few, animals, building, of, roads, and, human, settlement, near, panda, habitat, result, in, population, declines, diseases, from, domesticated, pets, and, livestock, is, another, threat, by, 2100, it, is, estimated, that, the, distribution, of, giant, pandas, will, shrink, by, up, to, 100, mainly, due, to, the, effects, of, climate, change, the, giant, panda, is, listed, on, cites, appendix, i, meaning, trade, of, their, parts, is, prohibited, and, that, they, require, this, protection, to, avoid, extinction, they, have, been, protected, and, placed, in, category, 1, by, the, 1988, wildlife, protection, act, the, giant, panda, has, been, a, target, of, poaching, by, locals, since, ancient, times, and, by, foreigners, since, it, was, introduced, to, the, west, starting, in, the, 1930s, foreigners, were, unable, to, poach, giant, pandas, in, china, because, of, the, second, sino, japanese, war, and, the, chinese, civil, war, but, pandas, remained, a, source, of, soft, furs, for, the, locals, the, population, boom, in, china, after, 1949, created, stress, on, the, pandas, habitat, and, the, subsequent, famines, led, to, the, increased, hunting, of, wildlife, including, pandas, after, the, chinese, economic, reform, demand, for, panda, skins, from, hong, kong, and, japan, led, to, illegal, poaching, for, the, black, market, acts, generally, ignored, by, the, local, officials, at, the, time, in, 1963, the, prc, government, set, up, wolong, national, nature, reserve, to, save, the, declining, panda, population, the, giant, panda, is, among, the, world, s, most, adored, and, protected, rare, animals, and, is, one, of, the, few, in, the, world, whose, natural, inhabitant, status, was, able, to, gain, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, designation, the, sichuan, giant, panda, sanctuaries, located, in, the, southwest, province, of, sichuan, and, covering, seven, natural, reserves, were, inscribed, onto, the, world, heritage, list, in, 2006, a, 2015, paper, found, that, the, giant, panda, can, serve, as, an, umbrella, species, as, the, preservation, of, their, habitat, also, helps, other, endemic, species, in, china, including, 70, of, the, country, s, forest, birds, 70, of, mammals, and, 31, of, amphibians, in, 2012, earthwatch, institute, a, global, nonprofit, that, teams, volunteers, with, scientists, to, conduct, important, environmental, research, launched, a, program, called, on, the, trail, of, giant, panda, this, program, based, in, the, wolong, national, nature, reserve, allows, volunteers, to, work, up, close, with, pandas, cared, for, in, captivity, and, help, them, adapt, to, life, in, the, wild, so, that, they, may, breed, and, live, longer, and, healthier, lives, efforts, to, preserve, the, panda, bear, populations, in, china, have, come, at, the, expense, of, other, animals, in, the, region, including, snow, leopards, wolves, and, dholes, in, order, to, improve, living, and, mating, conditions, for, the, fragmented, populations, of, pandas, nearly, 70, natural, reserves, have, been, combined, to, form, the, giant, panda, national, park, in, 2020, with, a, size, of, 10, 500, square, miles, the, park, is, roughly, three, times, as, large, as, yellowstone, national, park, and, incorporates, the, wolong, national, nature, reserve, small, isolated, populations, run, the, risk, of, inbreeding, and, smaller, genetic, variety, makes, the, individuals, more, vulnerable, to, various, defects, and, genetic, mutation, in, 2006, scientists, reported, that, the, number, of, pandas, living, in, the, wild, may, have, been, underestimated, at, about, 1, 000, previous, population, surveys, had, used, conventional, methods, to, estimate, the, size, of, the, wild, panda, population, but, using, a, new, method, that, analyzes, dna, from, panda, droppings, scientists, believed, the, wild, population, were, as, large, as, 3, 000, in, 2006, there, were, 40, panda, reserves, in, china, compared, to, just, 13, reserves, in, 1998, as, the, species, has, been, reclassified, from, endangered, to, vulnerable, since, 2016, the, conservation, efforts, are, thought, to, be, working, furthermore, in, response, to, this, reclassification, the, state, forestry, administration, of, china, announced, that, they, would, not, accordingly, lower, the, conservation, level, for, panda, and, would, instead, reinforce, the, conservation, efforts, in, 2020, the, panda, population, of, the, new, national, park, was, already, above, 1, 800, individuals, which, is, roughly, 80, percent, of, the, entire, panda, population, in, china, establishing, the, new, protected, area, in, the, sichuan, province, also, gives, various, other, endangered, or, threatened, species, like, the, siberian, tiger, the, possibility, to, improve, their, living, conditions, by, offering, them, a, habitat, other, species, who, benefit, from, the, protection, of, their, habitat, include, the, snow, leopard, the, golden, snub, nosed, monkey, the, red, panda, and, the, complex, toothed, flying, squirrel, in, july, 2021, chinese, conservation, authorities, announced, that, giant, pandas, are, no, longer, endangered, in, the, wild, following, years, of, conservation, efforts, with, a, population, in, the, wild, exceeding, 1, 800, china, has, received, international, praise, for, its, conservation, of, the, species, which, has, also, helped, the, country, establish, itself, as, a, leader, in, endangered, species, conservation, 8
