14, see, text, hornbills, are, birds, found, in, tropical, and, subtropical, africa, asia, and, melanesia, of, the, family, bucerotidae, they, are, characterized, by, a, long, down, curved, bill, which, is, frequently, brightly, coloured, and, sometimes, has, a, horny, casque, on, the, upper, mandible, hornbills, have, a, two, lobed, kidney, they, are, the, only, birds, in, which, the, first, and, second, neck, vertebrae, the, atlas, and, axis, respectively, are, fused, together, this, probably, provides, a, more, stable, platform, for, carrying, the, bill, the, family, is, omnivorous, feeding, on, fruit, and, small, animals, they, are, monogamous, breeders, nesting, in, natural, cavities, in, trees, and, sometimes, cliffs, a, number, of, mainly, insular, species, of, hornbill, with, small, ranges, are, threatened, with, extinction, mainly, in, southeast, asia, in, the, neotropical, realm, toucans, occupy, the, hornbills, ecological, niche, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, despite, their, close, appearances, the, two, groups, are, not, very, closely, related, with, toucans, being, allied, with, the, woodpeckers, honeyguides, and, several, families, of, barbet, while, hornbills, and, their, close, relatives, the, ground, hornbills, are, allied, with, the, hoopoes, and, wood, hoopoes, hornbills, show, considerable, variation, in, size, and, colors, the, smallest, species, is, the, black, dwarf, hornbill, tockus, hartlaubi, at, 99, 1, g, 3, 50, oz, and, 32, cm, 1, ft, 1, in, in, length, the, largest, and, most, massive, species, appears, to, be, the, southern, ground, hornbill, which, has, an, average, weight, of, 3, 77, kg, 8, 3, lb, and, can, weigh, up, to, 6, 3, kg, 14, lb, and, span, about, 180, cm, 5, ft, 11, in, across, the, wings, other, species, rival, the, southern, ground, species, in, length, at, up, to, about, 130, cm, 4, ft, 3, in, including, the, abyssinian, ground, hornbill, bucorvus, abyssinicus, the, great, hornbill, buceros, bicornis, and, probably, the, longest, of, all, perhaps, exceeding, 150, cm, 4, ft, 11, in, thanks, in, part, to, its, extended, tail, feathers, the, helmeted, hornbill, rhinoplax, vigil, males, are, always, bigger, than, the, females, though, the, extent, to, which, this, is, true, varies, according, to, species, the, extent, of, sexual, dimorphism, also, varies, with, body, parts, for, example, the, difference, in, body, mass, between, males, and, females, is, 1, 17, but, the, variation, is, 8, 30, for, bill, length, and, 1, 21, in, wing, length, the, most, distinctive, feature, of, the, hornbills, is, the, heavy, bill, supported, by, powerful, neck, muscles, as, well, as, by, the, fused, vertebrae, the, large, bill, assists, in, fighting, preening, constructing, the, nest, and, catching, prey, a, feature, unique, to, the, hornbills, is, the, casque, a, hollow, structure, that, runs, along, the, upper, mandible, in, some, species, it, is, barely, perceptible, and, appears, to, serve, no, function, beyond, reinforcing, the, bill, in, other, species, it, is, quite, large, is, reinforced, with, bone, and, has, openings, between, the, hollow, centre, allowing, it, to, serve, as, a, resonator, for, calls, in, the, helmeted, hornbill, the, casque, is, not, hollow, but, is, filled, with, hornbill, ivory, and, is, used, as, a, battering, ram, in, dramatic, aerial, jousts, aerial, casque, butting, has, also, been, reported, in, the, great, hornbill, the, plumage, of, hornbills, is, typically, black, grey, white, or, brown, and, is, frequently, offset, by, bright, colours, on, the, bill, or, by, patches, of, bare, coloured, skin, on, the, face, or, wattles, some, species, exhibit, sexual, dichromatism, where, the, colouration, of, soft, parts, varies, by, sex, hornbills, possess, binocular, vision, although, unlike, most, birds, with, this, type, of, vision, the, bill, intrudes, on, their, visual, field, this, allows, them, to, see, their, own, bill, tip, and, aids, in, precision, handling, of, food, objects, with, their, bill, the, eyes, are, also, protected, by, large, eyelashes, which, act, as, a, sunshade, the, bucerotidae, include, about, 55, living, species, though, a, number, of, cryptic, species, may, yet, be, split, as, has, been, suggested, for, the, red, billed, hornbill, their, distribution, includes, sub, saharan, africa, and, the, indian, subcontinent, to, the, philippines, and, the, solomon, islands, but, no, genus, is, found, in, both, africa, and, asia, most, are, arboreal, birds, but, the, large, ground, hornbills, bucorvus, as, their, name, implies, are, terrestrial, birds, of, open, savanna, of, the, 24, species, found, in, africa, 13, are, birds, of, the, more, open, woodlands, and, savanna, and, some, occur, even, in, highly, arid, environments, the, remaining, species, are, found, in, dense, forests, this, contrasts, with, asia, where, a, single, species, occurs, in, open, savanna, and, the, remainder, are, forest, species, the, indian, subcontinent, has, 10, species, of, hornbills, of, which, 9, are, found, in, india, and, adjoining, countries, while, the, sri, lanka, grey, hornbill, is, restricted, to, the, island, the, most, common, widespread, species, in, the, indian, subcontinent, is, the, indian, grey, hornbill, according, to, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, indonesia, has, 13, hornbill, species, 9, of, them, exist, in, sumatra, and, the, rest, exist, in, sumba, sulawesi, papua, and, kalimantan, kalimantan, has, the, same, hornbill, species, as, sumatra, except, that, the, great, hornbill, is, not, found, there, in, the, neogene, at, least, in, the, late, miocene, hornbills, inhabited, north, africa, and, south, europe, their, remains, have, been, found, in, morocco, and, bulgaria, the, oldest, known, hornbill, is, from, the, early, miocene, of, uganda, around, 19, million, years, ago, which, is, similar, to, modern, tockus, hornbills, are, diurnal, generally, travelling, in, pairs, or, small, family, groups, larger, flocks, sometimes, form, outside, the, breeding, season, the, largest, assemblies, of, hornbills, form, at, some, roosting, sites, where, as, many, as, 2400, individual, birds, may, be, found, hornbills, are, omnivorous, birds, eating, fruit, insects, and, small, animals, they, cannot, swallow, food, caught, at, the, tip, of, the, beak, as, their, tongues, are, too, short, to, manipulate, it, so, they, toss, it, back, to, the, throat, with, a, jerk, of, the, head, while, both, open, country, and, forest, species, are, omnivorous, species, that, specialise, in, feeding, on, fruit, are, generally, found, in, forests, while, the, more, carnivorous, species, are, found, in, open, country, forest, dwelling, species, of, hornbills, are, considered, to, be, important, seed, dispersers, some, hornbill, species, e, g, malabar, pied, hornbill, even, have, a, great, preference, for, the, fruits, of, the, strychnine, tree, strychnos, nux, vomica, which, contain, the, potent, poison, strychnine, some, hornbills, defend, a, fixed, territory, territoriality, is, related, to, diet, fruit, sources, are, often, patchily, distributed, and, require, long, distance, travel, to, find, thus, species, that, specialise, in, fruit, are, less, territorial, hornbills, generally, form, monogamous, pairs, although, some, species, engage, in, cooperative, breeding, the, female, lays, up, to, six, white, eggs, in, existing, holes, or, crevices, either, in, trees, or, rocks, the, cavities, are, usually, natural, but, some, species, may, nest, in, the, abandoned, nests, of, woodpeckers, and, barbets, nesting, sites, may, be, used, in, consecutive, breeding, seasons, by, the, same, pair, before, incubation, the, females, of, all, bucerotinae, sometimes, assisted, by, the, male, begin, to, close, the, entrance, to, the, nest, cavity, with, a, wall, made, of, mud, droppings, and, fruit, pulp, when, the, female, is, ready, to, lay, her, eggs, the, entrance, is, just, large, enough, for, her, to, enter, the, nest, and, after, she, has, done, so, the, remaining, opening, is, also, all, but, sealed, shut, there, is, only, one, narrow, aperture, big, enough, for, the, male, to, transfer, food, to, the, mother, and, eventually, the, chicks, the, function, of, this, behaviour, is, apparently, related, to, protecting, the, nesting, site, from, rival, hornbills, the, sealing, can, be, done, in, just, a, few, hours, at, most, it, takes, a, few, days, after, the, nest, is, sealed, the, hornbill, takes, another, five, days, to, lay, the, first, egg, clutch, size, varies, from, one, or, two, eggs, in, the, larger, species, to, up, to, eight, eggs, for, the, smaller, species, during, the, incubation, period, the, female, undergoes, a, complete, and, simultaneous, moult, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, darkness, of, the, cavity, triggers, a, hormone, involved, in, moulting, non, breeding, females, and, males, go, through, a, sequential, moult, when, the, chicks, and, the, female, are, too, big, to, fit, in, the, nest, the, mother, breaks, out, the, nest, and, both, parents, feed, the, chicks, in, some, species, the, mother, rebuilds, the, wall, whereas, in, others, the, chicks, rebuild, the, wall, unaided, the, ground, hornbills, do, not, adopt, this, behaviour, but, are, conventional, cavity, nesters, a, number, of, hornbills, have, associations, with, other, animal, species, for, example, some, species, of, hornbills, in, africa, have, a, mutualistic, relationship, with, dwarf, mongooses, foraging, together, and, warning, each, other, of, nearby, birds, of, prey, and, other, predators, other, relationships, are, commensal, for, example, following, monkeys, or, other, animals, and, eating, the, insects, flushed, up, by, them, the, family, bucerotidae, was, introduced, as, buceronia, by, the, french, polymath, constantine, samuel, rafinesque, in, 1815, it, comes, from, the, genus, name, buceros, given, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, from, the, greek, word, b, ukeros, which, means, cow, horn, there, are, two, subfamilies, the, bucorvinae, contain, the, two, ground, hornbills, in, a, single, genus, and, the, bucerotinae, contain, all, other, taxa, traditionally, they, are, included, in, the, order, coraciiformes, which, includes, also, kingfishers, rollers, hoopoes, and, bee, eaters, in, the, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, however, hornbills, are, separated, from, the, coraciiformes, into, an, order, of, their, own, bucerotiformes, with, the, subfamilies, elevated, to, family, level, given, that, they, are, almost, as, distant, from, the, rollers, kingfishers, and, allies, as, are, the, trogons, the, arrangement, chosen, is, more, a, matter, of, personal, taste, than, any, well, established, taxonomic, practice, all, that, can, be, said, with, reasonable, certainty, is, that, placing, the, hornbills, outside, the, coraciiformes, and, the, trogons, inside, would, be, incorrect, genetic, data, suggests, that, ground, hornbills, and, bycanistes, form, a, clade, outside, the, rest, of, the, hornbill, lineage, they, are, thought, to, represent, an, early, african, lineage, while, the, rest, of, bucerotiformes, evolved, in, asia, however, another, study, claims, that, the, ground, hornbills, diverged, first, followed, by, tockus, within, tockus, two, clades, have, been, identified, based, on, genetics, and, vocal, types, whistlers, and, cluckers, the, cluckers, have, been, placed, in, a, separate, genus, lophoceros, bycanistes, belongs, to, a, clade, of, mostly, african, species, that, also, includes, ceratogymna, and, tropicranus, another, member, of, this, clade, is, the, black, dwarf, hornbill, the, black, dwarf, hornbill, is, typically, classified, in, the, genus, tockus, but, in, this, study, is, a, sister, species, to, the, white, crested, hornbill, if, these, two, species, are, classified, in, congeneric, tropicranus, becomes, a, junior, synonym, of, horizocerus, as, that, was, one, of, the, old, names, used, for, the, black, dwarf, hornbill, this, clade, also, includes, one, southeast, asian, species, the, white, crowned, hornbill, as, for, the, other, asian, hornbill, species, buceros, and, rhinoplax, are, each, other, s, closest, relatives, anorrhinus, is, part, of, a, clade, that, has, ocyceros, and, anthracoceros, as, sister, taxa, and, aceros, rhyticeros, and, penelopides, form, another, clade, however, according, to, this, study, aceros, is, polyphyletic, the, rufous, headed, hornbill, writhed, hornbill, and, wrinkled, hornbill, form, a, clade, with, the, sulawesi, hornbill, and, are, in, turn, more, closely, related, to, penelopides, these, four, species, have, been, classified, in, a, separate, genus, rhabdotorrhinus, similarly, the, knobbed, hornbill, is, more, closely, related, to, rhyticeros, leaving, the, rufous, necked, hornbill, the, only, member, of, the, genus, aceros, the, following, cladogram, showing, the, relationships, between, the, genera, is, based, on, a, molecular, phylogenetic, study, by, juan, carlos, gonzalez, and, collaborators, that, was, published, in, 2013, the, number, of, species, in, each, genus, is, taken, from, the, list, of, world, birds, maintained, by, frank, gill, pamela, c, rasmussen, and, david, donsker, on, behalf, of, the, international, ornithologists, union, lophoceros, 8, species, tockus, 10, species, berenicornis, white, crowned, hornbill, horizocerus, 4, species, ceratogymna, 2,

before, india, merged, with, asia, most, species, casques, are, very, light, containing, much, airspace, however, the, helmeted, hornbill, has, a, solid, casque, made, of, a, material, called, hornbill, ivory, which, is, greatly, valued, as, a, carving, material, in, china, and, japan, it, was, used, as, a, medium, for, the, art, of, netsuke, also, used, for, hunting, purposes, in, places, like, india, the, iban, people, of, borneo, regards, the, rhinoceros, hornbill, known, as, kenyalang, as, the, king, of, the, worldly, birds, who, acts, as, the, intermediary, between, the, man, and, the, god, the, wreathed, hornbill, undan, is, believed, by, the, iban, people, to, be, the, guide, of, dead, souls, to, the, lower, world, none, of, the, african, species, of, hornbills, are, seriously, threatened, but, many, asian, hornbills, are, threatened, by, hunting, and, habitat, loss, as, they, tend, to, require, primary, forest, among, these, threatened, species, only, the, plain, pouched, hornbill, and, rufous, necked, hornbill, are, found, on, the, asian, mainland, all, others, are, insular, in, their, distribution, in, the, philippines, alone, one, species, the, palawan, hornbill, is, vulnerable, and, two, species, the, mindoro, and, visayan, hornbills, are, endangered, two, of, the, three, critically, endangered, hornbills, the, rufous, headed, hornbill, and, the, sulu, hornbill, are, also, restricted, to, the, philippines, the, latter, species, is, one, of, the, world, s, rarest, birds, with, only, 20, breeding, pairs, or, 40, mature, individuals, and, faces, imminent, extinction, the, ticao, hornbill, a, subspecies, of, the, visayan, hornbill, is, probably, already, extinct, the, other, critically, endangered, species, the, helmeted, hornbill, is, threatened, by, uncontrolled, hunting, and, the, trade, in, hornbill, ivory, a, hornbill, named, zazu, is, the, king, s, adviser, and, one, of, the, characters, in, the, lion, king, franchise, voiced, by, rowan, atkinson, in, the, original, 1994, version, and, john, oliver, in, the, remade, 2019, version, hornbill, was, used, as, the, official, mascot, of, one, of, malaysia, s, political, parties,
