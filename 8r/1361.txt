epilepsy, is, a, group, of, non, communicable, neurological, disorders, characterized, by, recurrent, epileptic, seizures, an, epileptic, seizure, is, the, clinical, manifestation, of, an, abnormal, excessive, and, synchronized, electrical, discharge, in, the, neurons, the, occurrence, of, two, or, more, unprovoked, seizures, defines, epilepsy, the, occurrence, of, just, one, seizure, may, warrant, the, definition, set, out, by, the, international, league, against, epilepsy, in, a, more, clinical, usage, where, recurrence, may, be, able, to, be, prejudged, epileptic, seizures, can, vary, from, brief, and, nearly, undetectable, periods, to, long, periods, of, vigorous, shaking, due, to, abnormal, electrical, activity, in, the, brain, these, episodes, can, result, in, physical, injuries, either, directly, such, as, broken, bones, or, through, causing, accidents, in, epilepsy, seizures, tend, to, recur, and, may, have, no, detectable, underlying, cause, isolated, seizures, that, are, provoked, by, a, specific, cause, such, as, poisoning, are, not, deemed, to, represent, epilepsy, people, with, epilepsy, may, be, treated, differently, in, various, areas, of, the, world, and, experience, varying, degrees, of, social, stigma, due, to, the, alarming, nature, of, their, symptoms, the, underlying, mechanism, of, an, epileptic, seizure, is, excessive, and, abnormal, neuronal, activity, in, the, cortex, of, the, brain, which, can, be, observed, in, the, electroencephalogram, eeg, of, an, individual, the, reason, this, occurs, in, most, cases, of, epilepsy, is, unknown, cryptogenic, some, cases, occur, as, the, result, of, brain, injury, stroke, brain, tumors, infections, of, the, brain, or, birth, defects, through, a, process, known, as, epileptogenesis, known, genetic, mutations, are, directly, linked, to, a, small, proportion, of, cases, the, diagnosis, involves, ruling, out, other, conditions, that, might, cause, similar, symptoms, such, as, fainting, and, determining, if, another, cause, of, seizures, is, present, such, as, alcohol, withdrawal, or, electrolyte, problems, this, may, be, partly, done, by, imaging, the, brain, and, performing, blood, tests, epilepsy, can, often, be, confirmed, with, an, eeg, but, a, normal, reading, does, not, rule, out, the, condition, epilepsy, that, occurs, as, a, result, of, other, issues, may, be, preventable, seizures, are, controllable, with, medication, in, about, 69, of, cases, inexpensive, anti, seizure, medications, are, often, available, in, those, whose, seizures, do, not, respond, to, medication, surgery, neurostimulation, or, dietary, changes, may, be, considered, not, all, cases, of, epilepsy, are, lifelong, and, many, people, improve, to, the, point, that, treatment, is, no, longer, needed, as, of, 2021, about, 51, million, people, have, epilepsy, nearly, 80, of, cases, occur, in, the, developing, world, in, 2021, it, resulted, in, 140, 000, deaths, an, increase, from, 125, 000, in, 1990, epilepsy, is, more, common, in, children, and, older, people, in, the, developed, world, onset, of, new, cases, occurs, most, frequently, in, babies, and, the, elderly, in, the, developing, world, onset, is, more, common, at, the, extremes, of, age, in, younger, children, and, in, older, children, and, young, adults, due, to, differences, in, the, frequency, of, the, underlying, causes, about, 5, 10, of, people, will, have, an, unprovoked, seizure, by, the, age, of, 80, the, chance, of, experiencing, a, second, seizure, within, two, years, after, the, first, is, around, 40, in, many, areas, of, the, world, those, with, epilepsy, either, have, restrictions, placed, on, their, ability, to, drive, or, are, not, permitted, to, drive, until, they, are, free, of, seizures, for, a, specific, length, of, time, the, word, epilepsy, is, from, ancient, greek, to, seize, possess, or, afflict, epilepsy, is, characterized, by, a, long, term, risk, of, recurrent, epileptic, seizures, these, seizures, may, present, in, several, ways, depending, on, the, parts, of, the, brain, involved, and, the, person, s, age, the, most, common, type, 60, of, seizures, are, convulsive, which, involve, involuntary, muscle, contractions, of, these, one, third, begin, as, generalized, seizures, from, the, start, affecting, both, hemispheres, of, the, brain, and, impairing, consciousness, two, thirds, begin, as, focal, seizures, which, affect, one, hemisphere, of, the, brain, which, may, progress, to, generalized, seizures, the, remaining, 40, of, seizures, are, non, convulsive, an, example, of, this, type, is, the, absence, seizure, which, presents, as, a, decreased, level, of, consciousness, and, usually, lasts, about, 10, seconds, certain, experiences, known, as, auras, often, precede, focal, seizures, the, seizures, can, include, sensory, visual, hearing, or, smell, psychic, autonomic, and, motor, phenomena, depending, on, which, part, of, the, brain, is, involved, muscle, jerks, may, start, in, a, specific, muscle, group, and, spread, to, surrounding, muscle, groups, in, which, case, it, is, known, as, a, jacksonian, march, automatisms, may, occur, which, are, non, consciously, generated, activities, and, mostly, simple, repetitive, movements, like, smacking, the, lips, or, more, complex, activities, such, as, attempts, to, pick, up, something, there, are, six, main, types, of, generalized, seizures, they, all, involve, loss, of, consciousness, and, typically, happen, without, warning, tonic, clonic, seizures, occur, with, a, contraction, of, the, limbs, followed, by, their, extension, and, arching, of, the, back, which, lasts, 10, 30, seconds, the, tonic, phase, a, cry, may, be, heard, due, to, contraction, of, the, chest, muscles, followed, by, a, shaking, of, the, limbs, in, unison, clonic, phase, tonic, seizures, produce, constant, contractions, of, the, muscles, a, person, often, turns, blue, as, breathing, is, stopped, in, clonic, seizures, there, is, shaking, of, the, limbs, in, unison, after, the, shaking, has, stopped, it, may, take, 10, 30, minutes, for, the, person, to, return, to, normal, this, period, is, called, the, postictal, state, or, postictal, phase, loss, of, bowel, or, bladder, control, may, occur, during, a, seizure, people, experiencing, a, seizure, may, bite, their, tongue, either, the, tip, or, on, the, sides, in, tonic, clonic, seizure, bites, to, the, sides, are, more, common, tongue, bites, are, also, relatively, common, in, psychogenic, non, epileptic, seizures, psychogenic, non, epileptic, seizures, are, seizure, like, behavior, without, an, associated, synchronised, electrical, discharge, on, eeg, and, are, considered, a, dissociative, disorder, myoclonic, seizures, involve, very, brief, muscle, spasms, in, either, a, few, areas, or, all, over, these, sometimes, cause, the, person, to, fall, which, can, cause, injury, absence, seizures, can, be, subtle, with, only, a, slight, turn, of, the, head, or, eye, blinking, with, impaired, consciousness, typically, the, person, does, not, fall, over, and, returns, to, normal, right, after, it, ends, atonic, seizures, involve, losing, muscle, activity, for, greater, than, one, second, typically, occurring, on, both, sides, of, the, body, rarer, seizure, types, can, cause, involuntary, unnatural, laughter, gelastic, crying, dyscrastic, or, more, complex, experiences, such, as, d, j, vu, about, 6, of, those, with, epilepsy, have, seizures, that, are, often, triggered, by, specific, events, and, are, known, as, reflex, seizures, those, with, reflex, epilepsy, have, seizures, that, are, only, triggered, by, specific, stimuli, common, triggers, include, flashing, lights, and, sudden, noises, in, certain, types, of, epilepsy, seizures, happen, more, often, during, sleep, and, in, other, types, they, occur, almost, only, when, sleeping, in, 2017, the, international, league, against, epilepsy, published, new, uniform, guidelines, for, the, classification, of, seizures, as, well, as, epilepsies, along, with, their, cause, and, comorbidities, patients, with, epilepsy, may, experience, seizure, clusters, which, may, be, broadly, defined, as, an, acute, deterioration, in, seizure, control, the, prevalence, of, seizure, clusters, is, uncertain, given, that, studies, have, used, different, definitions, to, define, them, however, estimates, suggest, that, the, prevalence, may, range, from, 5, to, 50, of, epilepsy, patients, refractory, epilepsy, patients, who, have, a, high, seizure, frequency, are, at, the, greatest, risk, for, having, seizure, clusters, seizure, clusters, are, associated, with, increased, healthcare, use, worse, quality, of, life, impaired, psychosocial, functioning, and, possibly, increased, mortality, benzodiazepines, are, used, as, an, acute, treatment, for, seizure, clusters, after, the, active, portion, of, a, seizure, the, ictal, state, there, is, typically, a, period, of, recovery, during, which, there, is, confusion, referred, to, as, the, postictal, period, before, a, normal, level, of, consciousness, returns, it, usually, lasts, 3, to, 15, minutes, but, may, last, for, hours, other, common, symptoms, include, feeling, tired, headache, difficulty, speaking, and, abnormal, behavior, psychosis, after, a, seizure, is, relatively, common, occurring, in, 6, 10, of, people, often, people, do, not, remember, what, happened, during, this, time, localized, weakness, known, as, todd, s, paralysis, may, also, occur, after, a, focal, seizure, it, would, typically, last, for, seconds, to, minutes, but, may, rarely, last, for, a, day, or, two, epilepsy, can, have, adverse, effects, on, social, and, psychological, well, being, these, effects, may, include, social, isolation, stigmatization, or, disability, they, may, result, in, lower, educational, achievement, and, worse, employment, outcomes, learning, disabilities, are, common, in, those, with, the, condition, and, especially, among, children, with, epilepsy, the, stigma, of, epilepsy, can, also, affect, the, families, of, those, with, the, disorder, certain, disorders, occur, more, often, in, people, with, epilepsy, depending, partly, on, the, epilepsy, syndrome, present, these, include, depression, anxiety, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, ocd, and, migraine, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, affects, three, to, five, times, more, children, with, epilepsy, than, children, without, the, condition, adhd, and, epilepsy, have, significant, consequences, on, a, child, s, behavioral, learning, and, social, development, epilepsy, is, also, more, common, in, children, with, autism, approximately, one, in, three, people, with, epilepsy, have, a, lifetime, history, of, a, psychiatric, disorder, there, are, believed, to, be, multiple, causes, for, this, including, pathophysiological, changes, related, to, the, epilepsy, itself, as, well, as, adverse, experiences, related, to, living, with, epilepsy, e, g, stigma, discrimination, in, addition, it, is, thought, that, the, relationship, between, epilepsy, and, psychiatric, disorders, is, not, unilateral, but, rather, bidirectional, for, example, patients, with, depression, have, an, increased, risk, for, developing, new, onset, epilepsy, the, presence, of, comorbid, depression, or, anxiety, in, patients, with, epilepsy, is, associated, with, a, poorer, quality, of, life, increased, mortality, increased, healthcare, use, and, a, worse, response, to, treatment, including, surgical, anxiety, disorders, and, depression, may, explain, more, variability, in, quality, of, life, than, seizure, type, or, frequency, there, is, evidence, that, both, depression, and, anxiety, disorders, are, underdiagnosed, and, undertreated, in, patients, with, epilepsy, epilepsy, can, have, both, genetic, and, acquired, causes, with, the, interaction, of, these, factors, in, many, cases, established, acquired, causes, include, serious, brain, trauma, stroke, tumours, and, brain, problems, resulting, from, a, previous, infection, in, about, 60, of, cases, the, cause, is, unknown, epilepsies, caused, by, genetic, congenital, or, developmental, conditions, are, more, common, among, younger, people, while, brain, tumors, and, strokes, are, more, likely, in, older, people, seizures, may, also, occur, as, a, consequence, of, other, health, problems, if, they, occur, right, around, a, specific, cause, such, as, a, stroke, head, injury, toxic, ingestion, or, metabolic, problem, they, are, known, as, acute, symptomatic, seizures, and, are, in, the, broader, classification, of, seizure, related, disorders, rather, than, epilepsy, itself, genetics, is, believed, to, be, involved, in, the, majority, of, cases, either, directly, or, indirectly, some, epilepsies, are, due, to, a, single, gene, defect, 1, 2, most, are, due, to, the, interaction, of, multiple, genes, and, environmental, factors, each, of, the, single, gene, defects, is, rare, with, more, than, 200, in, all, described, most, genes, involved, affect, ion, channels, either, directly, or, indirectly, these, include, genes, for, ion, channels, enzymes, gaba, and, g, protein, coupled, receptors, in, identical, twins, if, one, is, affected, there, is, a, 50, 60, chance, that, the, other, will, also, be, affected, in, non, identical, twins, the, risk, is, 15, these, risks, are, greater, in, those, with, generalized, rather, than, focal, seizures, if, both, twins, are, affected, most, of, the, time, they, have, the, same, epileptic, syndrome, 70, 90, other, close, relatives, of, a, person, with, epilepsy, have, a, risk, five, times, that, of, the, general, population, between, 1, and, 10, of, those, with, down, syndrome, and, 90, of, those, with, angelman, syndrome, have, epilepsy, phakomatoses, also, known, as, neurocutaneous, disorders, are, a, group, of, multisystemic, diseases, that, most, prominently, affect, the, skin, and, central, nervous, system, they, are, caused, by, defective, development, of, the, embryonic, ectodermal, tissue, that, is, most, often, due, to, a, single, genetic, mutation, the, brain, as, well, as, other, neural, tissue, and, the, skin, are, all, derived, from, the, ectoderm, and, thus, defective, development, may, result, in, epilepsy, as, well, as, other, manifestations, such, as, autism, and, intellectual, disability, some, types, of, phakomatoses, such, as, tuberous, sclerosis, complex, and, sturge, weber, syndrome, have, a, higher, prevalence, of, epilepsy, relative, to, others, such, as, neurofibromatosis, type, 1, tuberous, sclerosis, complex, is, an, autosomal, dominant, disorder, that, is, caused, by, mutations, in, either, the, tsc1, or, tsc2, gene, and, it, affects, approximately, 1, in, 6, 000, 10, 000, live, births, these, mutations, result, in, the, upregulation, of, the, mechanistic, target, of, rapamycin, mtor, pathway, which, leads, to, the, growth, of, tumors, in, many, organs, including, the, brain, skin, heart, eyes, and, kidneys, in, addition, abnormal, mtor, activity, is, believed, to, alter, neural, excitability, the, prevalence, of, epilepsy, is, estimated, to, be, 80, 90, the, majority, of, cases, of, epilepsy, present, within, the, first, 3, years, of, life, and, are, medically, refractory, relatively, recent, developments, for, the, treatment, of, epilepsy, in, tsc, patients, include, mtor, inhibitors, cannabidiol, and, vigabatrin, epilepsy, surgery, is, often, pursued, sturge, weber, syndrome, is, caused, by, an, activating, somatic, mutation, in, the, gnaq, gene, and, it, affects, approximately, 1, in, 20, 000, 50, 000, live, births, the, mutation, results, in, vascular, malformations, affecting, the, brain, skin, and, eyes, the, typical, presentation, includes, a, facial, port, wine, birthmark, ocular, angiomas, and, cerebral, vascular, malformations, which, are, most, often, unilateral, but, are, bilateral, in, 15, of, cases, the, prevalence, of, epilepsy, is, 75, 100, and, is, higher, in, those, with, bilateral, involvement, seizures, typically, occur, within, the, first, two, years, of, life, and, are, refractory, in, nearly, half, of, cases, however, high, rates, of, seizure, freedom, with, surgery, have, been, reported, in, as, many, as, 83, neurofibromatosis, type, 1, is, the, most, common, phakomatoses, and, occurs, in, approximately, 1, in, 3, 000, live, births, it, is, caused, by, autosomal, dominant, mutations, in, the, neurofibromin, 1, gene, clinical, manifestations, are, variable, but, may, include, hyperpigmented, skin, marks, hamartomas, of, the, iris, called, lisch, nodules, neurofibromas, optic, pathway, gliomas, and, cognitive, impairment, the, prevalence, of, epilepsy, is, estimated, to, be, 4, 7, seizures, are, typically, easier, to, control, with, anti, seizure, medications, relative, to, other, phakomatoses, but, in, some, refractory, cases, surgery, may, need, to, be, pursued, epilepsy, may, occur, as, a, result, of, several, other, conditions, including, tumors, strokes, head, trauma, previous, infections, of, the, central, nervous, system, genetic, abnormalities, and, as, a, result, of, brain, damage, around, the, time, of, birth, of, those, with, brain, tumors, almost, 30, have, epilepsy, making, them, the, cause, of, about, 4, of, cases, the, risk, is, greatest, for, tumors, in, the, temporal, lobe, and, those, that, grow, slowly, other, mass, lesions, such, as, cerebral, cavernous, malformations, and, arteriovenous, malformations, have, risks, as, high, as, 40, 60, of, those, who, have, had, a, stroke, 6, 10, develop, epilepsy, risk, factors, for, post, stroke, epilepsy, include, stroke, severity, cortical, involvement, hemorrhage, and, early, seizures, between, 6, and, 20, of, epilepsy, is, believed, to, be, due, to, head, trauma, mild, brain, injury, increases, the, risk, about, two, fold, while, severe, brain, injury, increases, the, risk, seven, fold, in, those, who, have, experienced, a, high, powered, gunshot, wound, to, the, head, the, risk, is, about, 50, some, evidence, links, epilepsy, and, celiac, disease, and, non, celiac, gluten, sensitivity, while, other, evidence, does, not, there, appears, to, be, a, specific, syndrome, that, includes, coeliac, disease, epilepsy, and, calcifications, in, the, brain, a, 2012, review, estimates, that, between, 1, and, 6, of, people, with, epilepsy, have, coeliac, disease, while, 1, of, the, general, population, has, the, condition, the, risk, of, epilepsy, following, meningitis, is, less, than, 10, it, more, commonly, causes, seizures, during, the, infection, itself, in, herpes, simplex, encephalitis, the, risk, of, a, seizure, is, around, 50, with, a, high, risk, of, epilepsy, following, up, to, 25, a, form, of, an, infection, with, the, pork, tapeworm, cysticercosis, in, the, brain, is, known, as, neurocysticercosis, and, is, the, cause, of, up, to, half, of, epilepsy, cases, in, areas, of, the, world, where, the, parasite, is, common, epilepsy, may, also, occur, after, other, brain, infections, such, as, cerebral, malaria, toxoplasmosis, and, toxocariasis, chronic, alcohol, use, increases, the, risk, of, epilepsy, those, who, drink, six, units, of, alcohol, per, day, have, a, 2, 5, fold, increase, in, risk, other, risks, include, alzheimer, s, disease, multiple, sclerosis, and, autoimmune, encephalitis, getting, vaccinated, does, not, increase, the, risk, of, epilepsy, malnutrition, is, a, risk, factor, seen, mostly, in, the, developing, world, although, it, is, unclear, however, if, it, is, a, direct, cause, or, an, association, people, with, cerebral, palsy, have, an, increased, risk, of, epilepsy, with, half, of, people, with, spastic, quadriplegia, and, spastic, hemiplegia, having, the, condition, normally, brain, electrical, activity, is, non, synchronous, as, large, numbers, of, neurons, do, not, normally, fire, at, the, same, time, but, rather, fire, in, order, as, signals, travel, throughout, the, brain, neuron, activity, is, regulated, by, various, factors, both, within, the, cell, and, the, cellular, environment, factors, within, the, neuron, include, the, type, number, and, distribution, of, ion, channels, changes, to, receptors, and, changes, of, gene, expression, factors, around, the, neuron, include, ion, concentrations, synaptic, plasticity, and, regulation, of, transmitter, breakdown, by, glial, cells, the, exact, mechanism, of, epilepsy, is, unknown, but, a, little, is, known, about, its, cellular, and, network, mechanisms, however, it, is, unknown, under, which, circumstances, the, brain, shifts, into, the, activity, of, a, seizure, with, its, excessive, synchronization, in, epilepsy, the, resistance, of, excitatory, neurons, to, fire, during, this, period, is, decreased, this, may, occur, due, to, changes, in, ion, channels, or, inhibitory, neurons, not, functioning, properly, this, then, results, in, a, specific, area, from, which, seizures, may, develop, known, as, a, seizure, focus, another, mechanism, of, epilepsy, may, be, the, up, regulation, of, excitatory, circuits, or, down, regulation, of, inhibitory, circuits, following, an, injury, to, the, brain, these, secondary, epilepsies, occur, through, processes, known, as, epileptogenesis, failure, of, the, blood, brain, barrier, may, also, be, a, causal, mechanism, as, it, would, allow, substances, in, the, blood, to, enter, the, brain, there, is, evidence, that, epileptic, seizures, are, usually, not, a, random, event, seizures, are, often, brought, on, by, factors, also, known, as, triggers, such, as, stress, excessive, alcohol, use, flickering, light, or, a, lack, of, sleep, among, others, the, term, seizure, threshold, is, used, to, indicate, the, amount, of, stimulus, necessary, to, bring, about, a, seizure, this, threshold, is, lowered, in, epilepsy, in, epileptic, seizures, a, group, of, neurons, begin, firing, in, an, abnormal, excessive, and, synchronized, manner, this, results, in, a, wave, of, depolarization, known, as, a, paroxysmal, depolarizing, shift, normally, after, an, excitatory, neuron, fires, it, becomes, more, resistant, to, firing, for, a, period, of, time, this, is, due, in, part, to, the, effect, of, inhibitory, neurons, electrical, changes, within, the, excitatory, neuron, and, the, negative, effects, of, adenosine, focal, seizures, begin, in, one, area, of, the, brain, while, generalized, seizures, begin, in, both, hemispheres, some, types, of, seizures, may, change, brain, structure, while, others, appear, to, have, little, effect, gliosis, neuronal, loss, and, atrophy, of, specific, areas, of, the, brain, are, linked, to, epilepsy, but, it, is, unclear, if, epilepsy, causes, these, changes, or, if, these, changes, result, in, epilepsy, the, seizures, can, be, described, on, different, scales, from, the, cellular, level, to, the, whole, brain, these, are, several, concomitant, factor, which, on, different, scale, can, drive, the, brain, to, pathological, states, and, trigger, a, seizure, the, diagnosis, of, epilepsy, is, typically, made, based, on, observation, of, the, seizure, onset, and, the, underlying, cause, an, electroencephalogram, eeg, to, look, for, abnormal, patterns, of, brain, waves, and, neuroimaging, ct, scan, or, mri, to, look, at, the, structure, of, the, brain, are, also, usually, part, of, the, initial, investigations, while, figuring, out, a, specific, epileptic, syndrome, is, often, attempted, it, is, not, always, possible, video, and, eeg, monitoring, may, be, useful, in, difficult, cases, epilepsy, is, a, disorder, of, the, brain, defined, by, any, of, the, following, conditions, furthermore, epilepsy, is, considered, to, be, resolved, for, individuals, who, had, an, age, dependent, epilepsy, syndrome, but, are, now, past, that, age, or, those, who, have, remained, seizure, free, for, the, last, 10, years, with, no, seizure, medicines, for, the, last, 5, years, this, 2014, definition, of, the, international, league, against, epilepsy, ilae, is, a, clarification, of, the, ilae, 2005, conceptual, definition, according, to, which, epilepsy, is, a, disorder, of, the, brain, characterized, by, an, enduring, predisposition, to, generate, epileptic, seizures, and, by, the, neurobiologic, cognitive, psychological, and, social, consequences, of, this, condition, the, definition, of, epilepsy, requires, the, occurrence, of, at, least, one, epileptic, seizure, it, is, therefore, possible, to, outgrow, epilepsy, or, to, undergo, treatment, that, causes, epilepsy, to, be, resolved, but, with, no, guarantee, that, it, will, not, return, in, the, definition, epilepsy, is, now, called, a, disease, rather, than, a, disorder, this, was, a, decision, of, the, executive, committee, of, the, ilae, taken, because, the, word, disorder, while, perhaps, having, less, stigma, than, does, disease, also, does, not, express, the, degree, of, seriousness, that, epilepsy, deserves, the, definition, is, practical, in, nature, and, is, designed, for, clinical, use, in, particular, it, aims, to, clarify, when, an, enduring, predisposition, according, to, the, 2005, conceptual, definition, is, present, researchers, statistically, minded, epidemiologists, and, other, specialized, groups, may, choose, to, use, the, older, definition, or, a, definition, of, their, own, devising, the, ilae, considers, doing, so, is, perfectly, allowable, so, long, as, it, is, clear, what, definition, is, being, used, the, ilae, definition, for, one, seizure, needs, an, understanding, of, projecting, an, enduring, predisposition, to, the, generation, of, epileptic, seizures, who, for, instance, chooses, to, just, use, the, traditional, definition, of, two, unprovoked, seizures, in, contrast, to, the, classification, of, seizures, which, focuses, on, what, happens, during, a, seizure, the, classification, of, epilepsies, focuses, on, the, underlying, causes, when, a, person, is, admitted, to, hospital, after, an, epileptic, seizure, the, diagnostic, workup, results, preferably, in, the, seizure, itself, being, classified, e, g, tonic, clonic, and, in, the, underlying, disease, being, identified, e, g, hippocampal, sclerosis, the, name, of, the, diagnosis, finally, made, depends, on, the, available, diagnostic, results, and, the, applied, definitions, and, classifications, of, seizures, and, epilepsies, and, its, respective, terminology, the, international, league, against, epilepsy, ilae, provided, a, classification, of, the, epilepsies, and, epileptic, syndromes, in, 1989, as, follows, this, classification, was, widely, accepted, but, has, also, been, criticized, mainly, because, the, underlying, causes, of, epilepsy, which, are, a, major, determinant, of, clinical, course, and, prognosis, were, not, covered, in, detail, in, 2010, the, ilae, commission, for, classification, of, the, epilepsies, addressed, this, issue, and, divided, epilepsies, into, three, categories, genetic, structural, metabolic, unknown, cause, which, were, refined, in, their, 2011, recommendation, into, four, categories, and, a, number, of, subcategories, reflecting, recent, technological, and, scientific, advances, cases, of, epilepsy, may, be, organized, into, epilepsy, syndromes, by, the, specific, features, that, are, present, these, features, include, the, age, that, seizure, begin, the, seizure, types, eeg, findings, among, others, identifying, an, epilepsy, syndrome, is, useful, as, it, helps, determine, the, underlying, causes, as, well, as, what, anti, seizure, medication, should, be, tried, the, ability, to, categorize, a, case, of, epilepsy, into, a, specific, syndrome, occurs, more, often, with, children, since, the, onset, of, seizures, is, commonly, early, less, serious, examples, are, benign, rolandic, epilepsy, 2, 8, per, 100, 000, childhood, absence, epilepsy, 0, 8, per, 100, 000, and, juvenile, myoclonic, epilepsy, 0, 7, per, 100, 000, severe, syndromes, with, diffuse, brain, dysfunction, caused, at, least, partly, by, some, aspect, of, epilepsy, are, also, referred, to, as, developmental, and, epileptic, encephalopathies, these, are, associated, with, frequent, seizures, that, are, resistant, to, treatment, and, cognitive, dysfunction, for, instance, lennox, gastaut, syndrome, 1, 2, of, all, persons, with, epilepsy, dravet, syndrome, 1, 15000, 40000, worldwide, and, west, syndrome, 1, 9, 100000, genetics, is, believed, to, play, an, important, role, in, epilepsies, by, a, number, of, mechanisms, simple, and, complex, modes, of, inheritance, have, been, identified, for, some, of, them, however, extensive, screening, have, failed, to, identify, many, single, gene, variants, of, large, effect, more, recent, exome, and, genome, sequencing, studies, have, begun, to, reveal, a, number, of, de, novo, gene, mutations, that, are, responsible, for, some, epileptic, encephalopathies, including, chd2, and, syngap1, and, dnm1, gabbr2, fasn, and, ryr3, syndromes, in, which, causes, are, not, clearly, identified, are, difficult, to, match, with, categories, of, the, current, classification, of, epilepsy, categorization, for, these, cases, was, made, somewhat, arbitrarily, the, idiopathic, unknown, cause, category, of, the, 2011, classification, includes, syndromes, in, which, the, general, clinical, features, and, or, age, specificity, strongly, point, to, a, presumed, genetic, cause, some, childhood, epilepsy, syndromes, are, included, in, the, unknown, cause, category, in, which, the, cause, is, presumed, genetic, for, instance, benign, rolandic, epilepsy, clinical, syndromes, in, which, epilepsy, is, not, the, main, feature, e, g, angelman, syndrome, were, categorized, symptomatic, but, it, was, argued, to, include, these, within, the, category, idiopathic, classification, of, epilepsies, and, particularly, of, epilepsy, syndromes, will, change, with, advances, in, research, an, electroencephalogram, eeg, can, assist, in, showing, brain, activity, suggestive, of, an, increased, risk, of, seizures, it, is, only, recommended, for, those, who, are, likely, to, have, had, an, epileptic, seizure, on, the, basis, of, symptoms, in, the, diagnosis, of, epilepsy, electroencephalography, may, help, distinguish, the, type, of, seizure, or, syndrome, present, in, children, it, is, typically, only, needed, after, a, second, seizure, unless, specified, by, a, specialist, it, cannot, be, used, to, rule, out, the, diagnosis, and, may, be, falsely, positive, in, those, without, the, condition, in, certain, situations, it, may, be, useful, to, perform, the, eeg, while, the, affected, individual, is, sleeping, or, sleep, deprived, diagnostic, imaging, by, ct, scan, and, mri, is, recommended, after, a, first, non, febrile, seizure, to, detect, structural, problems, in, and, around, the, brain, mri, is, generally, a, better, imaging, test, except, when, bleeding, is, suspected, for, which, ct, is, more, sensitive, and, more, easily, available, if, someone, attends, the, emergency, room, with, a, seizure, but, returns, to, normal, quickly, imaging, tests, may, be, done, at, a, later, point, if, a, person, has, a, previous, diagnosis, of, epilepsy, with, previous, imaging, repeating, the, imaging, is, usually, not, needed, even, if, there, are, subsequent, seizures, for, adults, the, testing, of, electrolyte, blood, glucose, and, calcium, levels, is, important, to, rule, out, problems, with, these, as, causes, an, electrocardiogram, can, rule, out, problems, with, the, rhythm, of, the, heart, a, lumbar, puncture, may, be, useful, to, diagnose, a, central, nervous, system, infection, but, is, not, routinely, needed, in, children, additional, tests, may, be, required, such, as, urine, biochemistry, and, blood, testing, looking, for, metabolic, disorders, together, with, eeg, and, neuroimaging, genetic, testing, is, becoming, one, of, the, most, important, diagnostic, technique, for, epilepsy, as, a, diagnosis, might, be, achieved, in, a, relevant, proportion, of, cases, with, severe, epilepsies, both, in, children, and, adults, for, those, with, negative, genetic, testing, in, some, it, might, be, important, to, repeat, or, re, analyze, previous, genetic, studies, after, 2, 3, years, a, high, blood, prolactin, level, within, the, first, 20, minutes, following, a, seizure, may, be, useful, to, help, confirm, an, epileptic, seizure, as, opposed, to, psychogenic, non, epileptic, seizure, serum, prolactin, level, is, less, useful, for, detecting, focal, seizures, if, it, is, normal, an, epileptic, seizure, is, still, possible, and, a, serum, prolactin, does, not, separate, epileptic, seizures, from, syncope, it, is, not, recommended, as, a, routine, part, of, the, diagnosis, of, epilepsy, diagnosis, of, epilepsy, can, be, difficult, a, number, of, other, conditions, may, present, very, similar, signs, and, symptoms, to, seizures, including, syncope, hyperventilation, migraines, narcolepsy, panic, attacks, and, psychogenic, non, epileptic, seizures, pnes, in, particular, syncope, can, be, accompanied, by, a, short, episode, of, convulsions, nocturnal, frontal, lobe, epilepsy, often, misdiagnosed, as, nightmares, was, considered, to, be, a, parasomnia, but, later, identified, to, be, an, epilepsy, syndrome, attacks, of, the, movement, disorder, paroxysmal, dyskinesia, may, be, taken, for, epileptic, seizures, the, cause, of, a, drop, attack, can, be, among, many, others, an, atonic, seizure, children, may, have, behaviors, that, are, easily, mistaken, for, epileptic, seizures, but, are, not, these, include, breath, holding, spells, bedwetting, night, terrors, tics, and, shudder, attacks, gastroesophageal, reflux, may, cause, arching, of, the, back, and, twisting, of, the, head, to, the, side, in, infants, which, may, be, mistaken, for, tonic, clonic, seizures, misdiagnosis, is, frequent, occurring, in, about, 5, to, 30, of, cases, different, studies, showed, that, in, many, cases, seizure, like, attacks, in, apparent, treatment, resistant, epilepsy, have, a, cardiovascular, cause, approximately, 20, of, the, people, seen, at, epilepsy, clinics, have, pnes, and, of, those, who, have, pnes, about, 10, also, have, epilepsy, separating, the, two, based, on, the, seizure, episode, alone, without, further, testing, is, often, difficult, while, many, cases, are, not, preventable, efforts, to, reduce, head, injuries, provide, good, care, around, the, time, of, birth, and, reduce, environmental, parasites, such, as, the, pork, tapeworm, may, be, effective, efforts, in, one, part, of, central, america, to, decrease, rates, of, pork, tapeworm, resulted, in, a, 50, decrease, in, new, cases, of, epilepsy, yoga, based, nadi, shodhana, pranayama, also, known, as, alternate, nostril, breathing, may,

dioxide, and, toxins, from, the, blood, epilepsy, can, be, dangerous, when, seizure, occurs, at, certain, times, the, risk, of, drowning, or, being, involved, in, a, motor, vehicle, collision, is, higher, it, is, also, found, that, people, with, epilepsy, are, more, likely, to, have, psychological, problems, other, complications, include, aspiration, pneumonia, and, difficulty, learning, epilepsy, is, usually, treated, with, daily, medication, once, a, second, seizure, has, occurred, while, medication, may, be, started, after, the, first, seizure, in, those, at, high, risk, for, subsequent, seizures, supporting, people, s, self, management, of, their, condition, may, be, useful, in, drug, resistant, cases, different, management, options, may, be, considered, including, special, diets, the, implantation, of, a, neurostimulator, or, neurosurgery, rolling, people, with, an, active, tonic, clonic, seizure, onto, their, side, and, into, the, recovery, position, helps, prevent, fluids, from, getting, into, the, lungs, putting, fingers, a, bite, block, or, tongue, depressor, in, the, mouth, is, not, recommended, as, it, might, make, the, person, vomit, or, result, in, the, rescuer, being, bitten, efforts, should, be, taken, to, prevent, further, self, injury, spinal, precautions, are, generally, not, needed, if, a, seizure, lasts, longer, than, 5, minutes, or, if, there, are, more, than, two, seizures, in, 5, minutes, without, a, return, to, a, normal, level, of, consciousness, between, them, it, is, considered, a, medical, emergency, known, as, status, epilepticus, this, may, require, medical, help, to, keep, the, airway, open, and, protected, a, nasopharyngeal, airway, may, be, useful, for, this, at, home, the, recommended, initial, medication, for, seizure, of, a, long, duration, is, midazolam, placed, in, the, nose, or, mouth, diazepam, may, also, be, used, rectally, in, hospital, intravenous, lorazepam, is, preferred, if, two, doses, of, benzodiazepines, are, not, effective, other, medications, such, as, phenytoin, are, recommended, convulsive, status, epilepticus, that, does, not, respond, to, initial, treatment, typically, requires, admission, to, the, intensive, care, unit, and, treatment, with, stronger, agents, such, as, midazolam, infusion, ketamine, thiopentone, or, propofol, most, institutions, have, a, preferred, pathway, or, protocol, to, be, used, in, a, seizure, emergency, like, status, epilepticus, these, protocols, have, been, found, to, be, effective, in, reducing, time, to, delivery, of, treatment, the, mainstay, treatment, of, epilepsy, is, anticonvulsant, medications, possibly, for, the, person, s, entire, life, the, choice, of, anticonvulsant, is, based, on, seizure, type, epilepsy, syndrome, other, medications, used, other, health, problems, and, the, person, s, age, and, lifestyle, a, single, medication, is, recommended, initially, if, this, is, not, effective, switching, to, a, single, other, medication, is, recommended, two, medications, at, once, is, recommended, only, if, a, single, medication, does, not, work, in, about, half, the, first, agent, is, effective, a, second, single, agent, helps, in, about, 13, and, a, third, or, two, agents, at, the, same, time, may, help, an, additional, 4, about, 30, of, people, continue, to, have, seizures, despite, anticonvulsant, treatment, there, are, a, number, of, medications, available, including, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and, valproate, evidence, suggests, that, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and, valproate, may, be, equally, effective, in, both, focal, and, generalized, seizures, controlled, release, carbamazepine, appears, to, work, as, well, as, immediate, release, carbamazepine, and, may, have, fewer, side, effects, in, the, united, kingdom, carbamazepine, or, lamotrigine, are, recommended, as, first, line, treatment, for, focal, seizures, with, levetiracetam, and, valproate, as, second, line, due, to, issues, of, cost, and, side, effects, valproate, is, recommended, first, line, for, generalized, seizures, with, lamotrigine, being, second, line, in, those, with, absence, seizures, ethosuximide, or, valproate, are, recommended, valproate, is, particularly, effective, in, myoclonic, seizures, and, tonic, or, atonic, seizures, if, seizures, are, well, controlled, on, a, particular, treatment, it, is, not, usually, necessary, to, routinely, check, the, medication, levels, in, the, blood, the, least, expensive, anticonvulsant, is, phenobarbital, at, around, us, 5, a, year, the, world, health, organization, gives, it, a, first, line, recommendation, in, the, developing, world, and, it, is, commonly, used, there, access, however, may, be, difficult, as, some, countries, label, it, as, a, controlled, drug, adverse, effects, from, medications, are, reported, in, 10, to, 90, of, people, depending, on, how, and, from, whom, the, data, is, collected, most, adverse, effects, are, dose, related, and, mild, some, examples, include, mood, changes, sleepiness, or, an, unsteadiness, in, gait, certain, medications, have, side, effects, that, are, not, related, to, dose, such, as, rashes, liver, toxicity, or, suppression, of, the, bone, marrow, up, to, a, quarter, of, people, stop, treatment, due, to, adverse, effects, some, medications, are, associated, with, birth, defects, when, used, in, pregnancy, many, of, the, common, used, medications, such, as, valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and, gabapentin, have, been, reported, to, cause, increased, risk, of, birth, defects, especially, when, used, during, the, first, trimester, despite, this, treatment, is, often, continued, once, effective, because, the, risk, of, untreated, epilepsy, is, believed, to, be, greater, than, the, risk, of, the, medications, among, the, antiepileptic, medications, levetiracetam, and, lamotrigine, seem, to, carry, the, lowest, risk, of, causing, birth, defects, slowly, stopping, medications, may, be, reasonable, in, some, people, who, do, not, have, a, seizure, for, two, to, four, years, however, around, a, third, of, people, have, a, recurrence, most, often, during, the, first, six, months, stopping, is, possible, in, about, 70, of, children, and, 60, of, adults, measuring, medication, levels, is, not, generally, needed, in, those, whose, seizures, are, well, controlled, epilepsy, surgery, should, be, considered, for, any, person, with, epilepsy, who, is, medically, refractory, patients, are, evaluated, on, a, case, by, case, basis, in, centres, that, are, familiar, with, and, have, expertise, in, epilepsy, surgery, results, from, a, 2023, systematic, review, found, that, surgical, interventions, for, children, aged, 1, 36, months, with, drug, resistant, epilepsy, can, lead, to, significant, seizure, reduction, or, freedom, especially, when, other, treatments, have, failed, epilepsy, surgery, may, be, an, option, for, people, with, focal, seizures, that, remain, a, problem, despite, other, treatments, these, other, treatments, include, at, least, a, trial, of, two, or, three, medications, the, goal, of, surgery, has, been, total, control, of, seizures, however, most, physicians, believe, that, even, palliative, surgery, where, the, burden, of, seizures, is, reduced, significantly, can, help, in, achieving, developmental, progress, or, reversal, of, developmental, stagnation, in, children, with, drug, resistant, epilepsy, and, this, may, be, achieved, in, 60, 70, of, cases, common, procedures, include, cutting, out, the, hippocampus, via, an, anterior, temporal, lobe, resection, removal, of, tumors, and, removing, parts, of, the, neocortex, some, procedures, such, as, a, corpus, callosotomy, are, attempted, in, an, effort, to, decrease, the, number, of, seizures, rather, than, cure, the, condition, following, surgery, medications, may, be, slowly, withdrawn, in, many, cases, neurostimulation, via, neuro, cybernetic, prosthesis, implantation, may, be, another, option, in, those, who, are, not, candidates, for, surgery, providing, chronic, pulsatile, electrical, stimulation, of, specific, nerve, or, brain, regions, alongside, standard, care, three, types, have, been, used, in, those, who, do, not, respond, to, medications, vagus, nerve, stimulation, vns, anterior, thalamic, stimulation, and, closed, loop, responsive, stimulation, rns, non, pharmacological, modulation, of, neurotransmitters, via, high, level, vns, h, vns, may, reduce, seizure, frequency, in, children, and, adults, who, do, not, respond, to, medical, and, or, surgical, therapy, when, compared, with, low, level, vns, l, vns, in, a, 2022, cochrane, review, of, four, randomized, controlled, trials, with, moderate, certainty, of, evidence, people, receiving, h, vns, treatment, were, 73, more, likely, 13, more, likely, to, 164, more, likely, to, experience, a, reduction, in, seizure, frequency, by, at, least, 50, the, minimum, threshold, defined, for, individual, clinical, response, potentially, 249, 163, to, 380, per, 1000, people, with, drug, resistant, epilepsy, may, achieve, a, 50, reduction, in, seizures, following, h, vns, benefiting, an, additional, 105, per, 1000, people, compared, with, l, vns, this, outcome, was, limited, by, the, number, of, studies, available, and, the, quality, of, one, trial, in, particular, wherein, three, people, received, l, vns, in, error, a, sensitivity, analysis, suggested, that, the, best, case, scenario, was, that, the, likelihood, of, clinical, response, to, h, vns, may, be, 91, 27, to, 189, higher, than, those, receiving, l, vns, in, the, worst, case, scenario, the, likelihood, of, clinical, response, to, h, vns, was, still, 61, higher, 7, higher, to, 143, higher, than, l, vns, despite, the, potential, benefit, for, h, vns, treatment, the, cochrane, review, also, found, that, the, risk, of, several, adverse, effects, was, greater, than, those, receiving, l, vns, there, was, moderate, certainty, of, evidence, that, voice, alteration, or, hoarseness, risk, may, be, 2, 17, 1, 49, to, 3, 17, fold, higher, than, people, receiving, l, vns, dyspnoea, risk, was, also, 2, 45, 1, 07, to, 5, 60, times, that, of, l, vns, recipients, although, the, low, number, of, events, and, studies, meant, that, the, certainty, of, evidence, was, low, the, risk, of, rebound, withdrawal, symptoms, coughing, pain, and, paraesthesia, was, unclear, there, is, promising, evidence, that, a, ketogenic, diet, high, fat, low, carbohydrate, adequate, protein, decreases, the, number, of, seizures, and, eliminates, seizures, in, some, however, further, research, is, necessary, a, 2022, systematic, review, of, the, literature, has, found, some, evidence, to, support, that, a, ketogenic, diet, or, modified, atkins, diet, can, be, helpful, in, the, treatment, of, epilepsy, in, some, infants, these, types, of, diets, may, be, beneficial, for, children, with, drug, resistant, epilepsy, the, use, for, adults, remains, uncertain, the, most, commonly, reported, adverse, effects, were, vomiting, constipation, and, diarrhoea, it, is, unclear, why, this, diet, works, in, people, with, coeliac, disease, or, non, celiac, gluten, sensitivity, and, occipital, calcifications, a, gluten, free, diet, may, decrease, the, frequency, of, seizures, avoidance, therapy, consists, of, minimizing, or, eliminating, triggers, for, example, those, who, are, sensitive, to, light, may, have, success, with, using, a, small, television, avoiding, video, games, or, wearing, dark, glasses, operant, based, biofeedback, based, on, the, eeg, waves, has, some, support, in, those, who, do, not, respond, to, medications, psychological, methods, should, not, however, be, used, to, replace, medications, exercise, has, been, proposed, as, possibly, useful, for, preventing, seizures, with, some, data, to, support, this, claim, some, dogs, commonly, referred, to, as, seizure, dogs, may, help, during, or, after, a, seizure, it, is, not, clear, if, dogs, have, the, ability, to, predict, seizures, before, they, occur, there, is, moderate, quality, evidence, supporting, the, use, of, psychological, interventions, along, with, other, treatments, in, epilepsy, this, can, improve, quality, of, life, enhance, emotional, wellbeing, and, reduce, fatigue, in, adults, and, adolescents, psychological, interventions, may, also, improve, seizure, control, for, some, individuals, by, promoting, self, management, and, adherence, as, an, add, on, therapy, in, those, who, are, not, well, controlled, with, other, medications, cannabidiol, appears, to, be, useful, in, some, children, in, 2018, the, fda, approved, this, product, for, lennox, gastaut, syndrome, and, dravet, syndrome, there, are, a, few, studies, on, the, use, of, dexamethasone, for, the, successful, treatment, of, drug, resistant, seizures, in, both, adults, and, children, alternative, medicine, including, acupuncture, routine, vitamins, and, yoga, have, no, reliable, evidence, to, support, their, use, in, epilepsy, melatonin, as, of, 2016, is, insufficiently, supported, by, evidence, the, trials, were, of, poor, methodological, quality, and, it, was, not, possible, to, draw, any, definitive, conclusions, several, supplements, with, varied, reliabilities, of, evidence, have, been, reported, to, be, helpful, for, drug, resistant, epilepsy, these, include, high, dose, omega, 3, berberine, manuka, honey, reishi, and, lion, s, mane, mushrooms, curcumin, vitamin, e, coenzyme, q, 10, and, resveratrol, the, reason, these, can, work, in, theory, is, that, they, reduce, inflammation, or, oxidative, stress, two, of, the, major, mechanism, contributing, to, epilepsy, women, of, child, bearing, age, including, those, with, epilepsy, are, at, risk, of, unintended, pregnancies, if, they, are, not, using, an, effective, form, of, contraception, women, with, epilepsy, may, experience, a, temporary, increase, in, seizure, frequency, when, they, begin, hormonal, contraception, some, anti, seizure, medications, interact, with, enzymes, in, the, liver, and, cause, the, drugs, in, hormonal, contraception, to, be, broken, down, more, quickly, these, enzyme, inducing, drugs, make, hormonal, contraception, less, effective, and, this, is, particularly, hazardous, if, the, anti, seizure, medication, is, associated, with, birth, defects, potent, enzyme, inducing, anti, seizure, medications, include, carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine, acetate, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, and, rufinamide, the, drugs, perampanel, and, topiramate, can, be, enzyme, inducing, at, higher, doses, conversely, hormonal, contraception, can, lower, the, amount, of, the, anti, seizure, medication, lamotrigine, circulating, in, the, body, making, it, less, effective, the, failure, rate, of, oral, contraceptives, when, used, correctly, is, 1, but, this, increases, to,

especially, if, they, have, other, medical, conditions, may, have, a, slightly, lower, but, still, high, chance, of, becoming, pregnant, women, with, infertility, have, about, the, same, chance, of, success, with, in, vitro, fertilisation, or, other, forms, of, assisted, reproductive, technology, as, women, without, epilepsy, there, may, be, a, higher, risk, of, pregnancy, loss, once, pregnant, there, are, two, main, concerns, related, to, pregnancy, the, first, concern, is, about, the, risk, of, seizures, during, pregnancy, and, the, second, concern, is, that, the, anti, seizure, medications, may, result, in, birth, defects, most, women, with, epilepsy, must, continue, treatment, with, anti, seizure, drugs, and, the, treatment, goal, is, to, balance, the, need, to, prevent, seizures, with, the, need, to, prevent, drug, induced, birth, defects, pregnancy, does, not, seem, to, change, seizure, frequency, very, much, when, seizures, happen, however, they, can, cause, some, pregnancy, complications, such, as, pre, term, births, or, the, babies, being, smaller, than, usual, when, they, are, born, all, pregnancies, have, a, risk, of, birth, defects, e, g, due, to, smoking, during, pregnancy, in, addition, to, this, typical, level, of, risk, some, anti, seizure, drugs, significantly, increase, the, risk, of, birth, defects, and, intrauterine, growth, restriction, as, well, as, developmental, neurocognitive, and, behavioral, disorders, most, women, with, epilepsy, receive, safe, and, effective, treatment, and, have, typical, healthy, children, the, highest, risks, are, associated, with, specific, anti, seizure, drugs, such, as, valproic, acid, and, carbamazepine, and, with, higher, doses, folic, acid, supplementation, such, as, through, prenatal, vitamins, reduced, the, risk, planning, pregnancies, in, advance, gives, women, with, epilepsy, an, opportunity, to, switch, to, a, lower, risk, treatment, program, and, reduced, drug, doses, although, anti, seizure, drugs, can, be, found, in, breast, milk, women, with, epilepsy, can, breastfeed, their, babies, and, the, benefits, usually, outweigh, the, risks, epilepsy, cannot, usually, be, cured, but, medication, can, control, seizures, effectively, in, about, 70, of, cases, of, those, with, generalized, seizures, more, than, 80, can, be, well, controlled, with, medications, while, this, is, true, in, only, 50, of, people, with, focal, seizures, one, predictor, of, long, term, outcome, is, the, number, of, seizures, that, occur, in, the, first, six, months, other, factors, increasing, the, risk, of, a, poor, outcome, include, little, response, to, the, initial, treatment, generalized, seizures, a, family, history, of, epilepsy, psychiatric, problems, and, waves, on, the, eeg, representing, generalized, epileptiform, activity, in, the, developing, world, 75, of, people, are, either, untreated, or, not, appropriately, treated, in, africa, 90, do, not, get, treatment, this, is, partly, related, to, appropriate, medications, not, being, available, or, being, too, expensive, people, with, epilepsy, may, have, a, higher, risk, of, premature, death, compared, to, those, without, the, condition, this, risk, is, estimated, to, be, between, 1, 6, and, 4, 1, times, greater, than, that, of, the, general, population, the, greatest, increase, in, mortality, from, epilepsy, is, among, the, elderly, those, with, epilepsy, due, to, an, unknown, cause, have, a, relatively, low, increase, in, risk, mortality, is, often, related, to, the, underlying, cause, of, the, seizures, status, epilepticus, suicide, trauma, and, sudden, unexpected, death, in, epilepsy, sudep, death, from, status, epilepticus, is, primarily, due, to, an, underlying, problem, rather, than, missing, doses, of, medications, the, risk, of, suicide, is, between, two, and, six, times, higher, in, those, with, epilepsy, the, cause, of, this, is, unclear, sudep, appears, to, be, partly, related, to, the, frequency, of, generalized, tonic, clonic, seizures, and, accounts, for, about, 15, of, epilepsy, related, deaths, it, is, unclear, how, to, decrease, its, risk, risk, factors, for, sudep, include, nocturnal, generalized, tonic, clonic, seizures, seizures, sleeping, alone, and, medically, intractable, epilepsy, in, the, united, kingdom, it, is, estimated, that, 40, 60, of, deaths, are, possibly, preventable, in, the, developing, world, many, deaths, are, due, to, untreated, epilepsy, leading, to, falls, or, status, epilepticus, epilepsy, is, one, of, the, most, common, serious, neurological, disorders, affecting, about, 50, million, people, as, of, 2021, it, affects, 1, of, the, population, by, age, 20, and, 3, of, the, population, by, age, 75, it, is, more, common, in, males, than, females, with, the, overall, difference, being, small, most, of, those, with, the, disorder, 80, are, in, low, income, populations, or, the, developing, world, the, estimated, prevalence, of, active, epilepsy, as, of, 2012, is, in, the, range, 3, 10, per, 1, 000, with, active, epilepsy, defined, as, someone, with, epilepsy, who, has, had, at, least, one, unprovoked, seizure, in, the, last, five, years, epilepsy, begins, each, year, in, 40, 70, per, 100, 000, in, developed, countries, and, 80, 140, per, 100, 000, in, developing, countries, poverty, is, a, risk, and, includes, both, being, from, a, poor, country, and, being, poor, relative, to, others, within, one, s, country, in, the, developed, world, epilepsy, most, commonly, starts, either, in, the, young, or, in, the, old, in, the, developing, world, its, onset, is, more, common, in, older, children, and, young, adults, due, to, the, higher, rates, of, trauma, and, infectious, diseases, in, developed, countries, the, number, of, cases, a, year, has, decreased, in, children, and, increased, among, the, elderly, between, the, 1970s, and, 2003, this, has, been, attributed, partly, to, better, survival, following, strokes, in, the, elderly, the, oldest, medical, records, show, that, epilepsy, has, been, affecting, people, at, least, since, the, beginning, of, recorded, history, throughout, ancient, history, the, condition, was, thought, to, be, of, a, spiritual, cause, the, world, s, oldest, description, of, an, epileptic, seizure, comes, from, a, text, in, akkadian, a, language, used, in, ancient, mesopotamia, and, was, written, around, 2000, bc, the, person, described, in, the, text, was, diagnosed, as, being, under, the, influence, of, a, moon, god, and, underwent, an, exorcism, epileptic, seizures, are, listed, in, the, code, of, hammurabi, c, 1790, bc, as, reason, for, which, a, purchased, slave, may, be, returned, for, a, refund, and, the, edwin, smith, papyrus, c, 1700, bc, describes, cases, of, individuals, with, epileptic, convulsions, the, oldest, known, detailed, record, of, the, condition, itself, is, in, the, sakikku, a, babylonian, cuneiform, medical, text, from, 1067, 1046, bc, this, text, gives, signs, and, symptoms, details, treatment, and, likely, outcomes, and, describes, many, features, of, the, different, seizure, types, as, the, babylonians, had, no, biomedical, understanding, of, the, nature, of, epilepsy, they, attributed, the, seizures, to, possession, by, evil, spirits, and, called, for, treating, the, condition, through, spiritual, means, around, 900, bc, punarvasu, atreya, described, epilepsy, as, loss, of, consciousness, this, definition, was, carried, forward, into, the, ayurvedic, text, of, charaka, samhita, c, 400, bc, the, ancient, greeks, had, contradictory, views, of, the, condition, they, thought, of, epilepsy, as, a, form, of, spiritual, possession, but, also, associated, the, condition, with, genius, and, the, divine, one, of, the, names, they, gave, to, it, was, the, sacred, disease, ancient, greek, epilepsy, appears, within, greek, mythology, it, is, associated, with, the, moon, goddesses, selene, and, artemis, who, afflicted, those, who, upset, them, the, greeks, thought, that, important, figures, such, as, julius, caesar, and, hercules, had, the, condition, the, notable, exception, to, this, divine, and, spiritual, view, was, that, of, the, school, of, hippocrates, in, the, fifth, century, bc, hippocrates, rejected, the, idea, that, the, condition, was, caused, by, spirits, in, his, landmark, work, on, the, sacred, disease, he, proposed, that, epilepsy, was, not, divine, in, origin, and, instead, was, a, medically, treatable, problem, originating, in, the, brain, he, accused, those, of, attributing, a, sacred, cause, to, the, condition, of, spreading, ignorance, through, a, belief, in, superstitious, magic, hippocrates, proposed, that, heredity, was, important, as, a, cause, described, worse, outcomes, if, the, condition, presents, at, an, early, age, and, made, note, of, the, physical, characteristics, as, well, as, the, social, shame, associated, with, it, instead, of, referring, to, it, as, the, sacred, disease, he, used, the, term, great, disease, giving, rise, to, the, modern, term, grand, mal, used, for, tonic, clonic, seizures, despite, his, work, detailing, the, physical, origins, of, the, condition, his, view, was, not, accepted, at, the, time, evil, spirits, continued, to, be, blamed, until, at, least, the, 17th, century, in, ancient, rome, people, did, not, eat, or, drink, with, the, same, pottery, as, that, used, by, someone, who, was, affected, people, of, the, time, would, spit, on, their, chest, believing, that, this, would, keep, the, problem, from, affecting, them, according, to, apuleius, and, other, ancient, physicians, to, detect, epilepsy, it, was, common, to, light, a, piece, of, gagates, whose, smoke, would, trigger, the, seizure, occasionally, a, spinning, potter, s, wheel, was, used, perhaps, a, reference, to, photosensitive, epilepsy, in, most, cultures, persons, with, epilepsy, have, been, stigmatized, shunned, or, even, imprisoned, as, late, as, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, in, tanzania, and, other, parts, of, africa, epilepsy, was, associated, with, possession, by, evil, spirits, witchcraft, or, poisoning, and, was, believed, by, many, to, be, contagious, in, the, salp, tri, re, the, birthplace, of, modern, neurology, jean, martin, charcot, found, people, with, epilepsy, side, by, side, with, the, mentally, ill, those, with, chronic, syphilis, and, the, criminally, insane, in, ancient, rome, epilepsy, was, known, as, the, morbus, comitialis, or, disease, of, the, assembly, hall, and, was, seen, as, a, curse, from, the, gods, in, northern, italy, epilepsy, was, traditionally, known, as, saint, valentine, s, malady, in, at, least, the, 1840s, in, the, united, states, of, america, epilepsy, was, known, as, the, falling, sickness, or, the, falling, fits, and, was, considered, a, form, of, medical, insanity, around, the, same, time, period, epilepsy, was, known, in, france, as, the, haut, mal, lit, high, evil, mal, de, terre, lit, earthen, sickness, mal, de, saint, jean, lit, saint, john, s, sickness, mal, des, enfans, lit, child, sickness, and, mal, caduc, lit, falling, sickness, patients, of, epilepsy, in, france, were, also, known, as, tombeurs, lit, people, who, fall, due, to, the, seizures, and, loss, of, consciousness, in, an, epileptic, episode, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, first, effective, anti, seizure, medication, bromide, was, introduced, the, first, modern, treatment, phenobarbital, was, developed, in, 1912, with, phenytoin, coming, into, use, in, 1938, social, stigma, is, commonly, experienced, around, the, world, by, those, with, epilepsy, it, can, affect, people, economically, socially, and, culturally, in, india, and, europe, epilepsy, may, be, used, as, justification, to, deny, marriage, people, in, some, areas, still, believe, those, with, epilepsy, to, be, cursed, in, parts, of, africa, such, as, tanzania, and, uganda, epilepsy, is, claimed, to, be, associated, with, possession, by, evil, spirits, witchcraft, or, poisoning, and, is, incorrectly, believed, by, many, to, be, contagious, before, 1971, in, the, united, kingdom, epilepsy, was, considered, grounds, for, the, annulment, of, marriage, the, stigma, may, result, in, some, people, with, epilepsy, denying, that, they, have, ever, had, seizures, seizures, result, in, direct, economic, costs, of, about, one, billion, dollars, in, the, united, states, epilepsy, resulted, in, economic, costs, in, europe, of, around, 15, 5, billion, euros, in, 2004, in, india, epilepsy, is, estimated, to, result, in, costs, of, us, 1, 7, billion, or, 0, 5, of, the, gdp, it, is, the, cause, of, about, 1, of, emergency, department, visits, 2, for, emergency, departments, for, children, in, the, united, states, those, with, epilepsy, are, at, about, twice, the, risk, of, being, involved, in, a, motor, vehicular, collision, and, thus, in, many, areas, of, the, world, are, not, allowed, to, drive, or, only, able, to, drive, if, certain, conditions, are, met, diagnostic, delay, has, been, suggested, to, be, a, cause, of, some, potentially, avoidable, motor, vehicle, collisions, since, at, least, one, study, showed, that, most, motor, vehicle, accidents, occurred, in, those, with, undiagnosed, non, motor, seizures, as, opposed, to, those, with, motor, seizures, at, epilepsy, onset, in, some, places, physicians, are, required, by, law, to, report, if, a, person, has, had, a, seizure, to, the, licensing, body, while, in, others, the, requirement, is, only, that, they, encourage, the, person, in, question, to, report, it, himself, countries, that, require, physician, reporting, include, sweden, austria, denmark, and, spain, countries, that, require, the, individual, to, report, include, the, uk, and, new, zealand, and, physicians, may, report, if, they, believe, the, individual, has, not, already, in, canada, the, united, states, and, australia, the, requirements, around, reporting, vary, by, province, or, state, if, seizures, are, well, controlled, most, feel, allowing, driving, is, reasonable, the, amount, of, time, a, person, must, be, free, from, seizures, before, he, can, drive, varies, by, country, many, countries, require, one, to, three, years, without, seizures, in, the, united, states, the, time, needed, without, a, seizure, is, determined, by, each, state, and, is, between, three, months, and, one, year, those, with, epilepsy, or, seizures, are, typically, denied, a, pilot, license, there, are, organizations, that, provide, support, for, people, and, families, affected, by, epilepsy, the, out, of, the, shadows, campaign, a, joint, effort, by, the, world, health, organization, the, ilae, and, the, international, bureau, for, epilepsy, provides, help, internationally, in, the, united, states, the, epilepsy, foundation, is, a, national, organization, that, works, to, increase, the, acceptance, of, those, with, the, disorder, their, ability, to, function, in, society, and, to, promote, research, for, a, cure, the, epilepsy, foundation, some, hospitals, and, some, individuals, also, run, support, groups, in, the, united, states, in, australia, the, epilepsy, foundation, provides, support, delivers, education, and, training, and, funds, research, for, people, living, with, epilepsy, international, epilepsy, day, world, epilepsy, day, began, in, 2015, and, occurs, on, the, second, monday, in, february, purple, day, a, different, world, wide, epilepsy, awareness, day, for, epilepsy, was, initiated, by, a, nine, year, old, canadian, named, cassidy, megan, in, 2008, and, is, every, year, on, 26, march, seizure, prediction, refers, to, attempts, to, forecast, epileptic, seizures, based, on, the, eeg, before, they, occur, as, of, 2011, no, effective, mechanism, to, predict, seizures, has, been, developed, although, no, effective, device, that, can, predict, seizures, is, available, the, science, behind, seizure, prediction, and, ability, to, deliver, such, a, tool, has, made, progress, kindling, where, repeated, exposures, to, events, that, could, cause, seizures, eventually, causes, seizures, more, easily, has, been, used, to, create, animal, models, of, epilepsy, different, animal, models, of, epilepsy, have, been, characterized, in, rodents, that, recapitulate, the, eeg, and, behavioral, concomitants, of, different, forms, of, epilepsy, in, particular, the, occurrence, of, recurrent, spontaneous, seizures, because, epileptic, seizures, of, different, kinds, are, observed, naturally, in, some, of, these, animals, strains, of, mice, and, rats, have, been, selected, to, be, used, as, genetic, models, of, epilepsy, in, particular, several, lines, of, mice, and, rats, display, spike, and, wave, discharges, when, eeg, recorded, and, have, been, studied, to, understand, absence, epilepsy, among, these, models, the, strain, of, gaers, genetic, absence, epilepsy, rats, from, strasbourg, was, characterized, in, the, 1980s, and, has, helped, to, understand, the, mechanisms, underlying, childhood, absence, epilepsy, rat, brain, slices, serve, as, a, valuable, model, for, assessing, the, potential, of, compounds, in, reducing, epileptiform, activity, by, evaluating, the, frequency, of, epileptiform, bursting, in, hippocampal, networks, researchers, can, identify, promising, candidates, for, novel, anti, seizure, drugs, one, of, the, hypotheses, present, in, the, literature, is, based, on, inflammatory, pathways, studies, supporting, this, mechanism, revealed, that, inflammatory, glycolipid, and, oxidative, factors, are, higher, in, epilepsy, patients, especially, those, with, generalized, epilepsy, gene, therapy, is, being, studied, in, some, types, of, epilepsy, medications, that, alter, immune, function, such, as, intravenous, immunoglobulins, may, reduce, the, frequency, of, seizures, when, including, in, normal, care, as, an, add, on, therapy, however, further, research, is, required, to, determine, whether, these, medications, are, very, well, tolerated, in, children, and, in, adults, with, epilepsy, noninvasive, stereotactic, radiosurgery, is, as, of, 2012, being, compared, to, standard, surgery, for, certain, types, of, epilepsy, epilepsy, occurs, in, a, number, of, other, animals, including, dogs, and, cats, it, is, in, fact, the, most, common, brain, disorder, in, dogs, it, is, typically, treated, with, anticonvulsants, such, as, levetiracetam, phenobarbital, or, bromide, in, dogs, and, phenobarbital, in, cats, imepitoin, is, also, used, in, dogs, while, generalized, seizures, in, horses, are, fairly, easy, to, diagnose, it, may, be, more, difficult, in, non, generalized, seizures, and, eegs, may, be, useful, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease
