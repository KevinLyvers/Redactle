https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipedalism
bipedalism, is, a, form, of, terrestrial, locomotion, where, an, animal, moves, by, means, of, its, two, rear, or, lower, limbs, or, legs, an, animal, or, machine, that, usually, moves, in, a, bipedal, manner, is, known, as, a, biped, b, a, p, d, meaning, two, feet, from, latin, bis, double, and, pes, foot, types, of, bipedal, movement, include, walking, or, running, a, bipedal, gait, and, hopping, several, groups, of, modern, species, are, habitual, bipeds, whose, normal, method, of, locomotion, is, two, legged, in, the, triassic, period, some, groups, of, archosaurs, a, group, that, includes, crocodiles, and, dinosaurs, developed, bipedalism, among, the, dinosaurs, all, the, early, forms, and, many, later, groups, were, habitual, or, exclusive, bipeds, the, birds, are, members, of, a, clade, of, exclusively, bipedal, dinosaurs, the, theropods, within, mammals, habitual, bipedalism, has, evolved, multiple, times, with, the, macropods, kangaroo, rats, and, mice, springhare, hopping, mice, pangolins, and, hominin, apes, australopithecines, including, humans, as, well, as, various, other, extinct, groups, evolving, the, trait, independently, a, larger, number, of, modern, species, intermittently, or, briefly, use, a, bipedal, gait, several, lizard, species, move, bipedally, when, running, usually, to, escape, from, threats, many, primate, and, bear, species, will, adopt, a, bipedal, gait, in, order, to, reach, food, or, explore, their, environment, though, there, are, a, few, cases, where, they, walk, on, their, hind, limbs, only, several, arboreal, primate, species, such, as, gibbons, and, indriids, exclusively, walk, on, two, legs, during, the, brief, periods, they, spend, on, the, ground, many, animals, rear, up, on, their, hind, legs, while, fighting, or, copulating, some, animals, commonly, stand, on, their, hind, legs, to, reach, food, keep, watch, threaten, a, competitor, or, predator, or, pose, in, courtship, but, do, not, move, bipedally, the, word, is, derived, from, the, latin, words, bi, s, two, and, ped, foot, as, contrasted, with, quadruped, four, feet, limited, and, exclusive, bipedalism, can, offer, a, species, several, advantages, bipedalism, raises, the, head, this, allows, a, greater, field, of, vision, with, improved, detection, of, distant, dangers, or, resources, access, to, deeper, water, for, wading, animals, and, allows, the, animals, to, reach, higher, food, sources, with, their, mouths, while, upright, non, locomotory, limbs, become, free, for, other, uses, including, manipulation, in, primates, and, rodents, flight, in, birds, digging, in, the, giant, pangolin, combat, in, bears, great, apes, and, the, large, monitor, lizard, or, camouflage, the, maximum, bipedal, speed, appears, slower, than, the, maximum, speed, of, quadrupedal, movement, with, a, flexible, backbone, both, the, ostrich, and, the, red, kangaroo, can, reach, speeds, of, 70, km, h, 43, mph, while, the, cheetah, can, exceed, 100, km, h, 62, mph, even, though, bipedalism, is, slower, at, first, over, long, distances, it, has, allowed, humans, to, outrun, most, other, animals, according, to, the, endurance, running, hypothesis, bipedality, in, kangaroo, rats, has, been, hypothesized, to, improve, locomotor, performance, which, could, aid, in, escaping, from, predators, zoologists, often, label, behaviors, including, bipedalism, as, facultative, i, e, optional, or, obligate, the, animal, has, no, reasonable, alternative, even, this, distinction, is, not, completely, clear, cut, for, example, humans, other, than, infants, normally, walk, and, run, in, biped, fashion, but, almost, all, can, crawl, on, hands, and, knees, when, necessary, there, are, even, reports, of, humans, who, normally, walk, on, all, fours, with, their, feet, but, not, their, knees, on, the, ground, but, these, cases, are, a, result, of, conditions, such, as, uner, tan, syndrome, very, rare, genetic, neurological, disorders, rather, than, normal, behavior, even, if, one, ignores, exceptions, caused, by, some, kind, of, injury, or, illness, there, are, many, unclear, cases, including, the, fact, that, normal, humans, can, crawl, on, hands, and, knees, this, article, therefore, avoids, the, terms, facultative, and, obligate, and, focuses, on, the, range, of, styles, of, locomotion, normally, used, by, various, groups, of, animals, normal, humans, may, be, considered, obligate, bipeds, because, the, alternatives, are, very, uncomfortable, and, usually, only, resorted, to, when, walking, is, impossible, there, are, a, number, of, states, of, movement, commonly, associated, with, bipedalism, the, great, majority, of, living, terrestrial, vertebrates, are, quadrupeds, with, bipedalism, exhibited, by, only, a, handful, of, living, groups, humans, gibbons, and, large, birds, walk, by, raising, one, foot, at, a, time, on, the, other, hand, most, macropods, smaller, birds, lemurs, and, bipedal, rodents, move, by, hopping, on, both, legs, simultaneously, tree, kangaroos, are, able, to, walk, or, hop, most, commonly, alternating, feet, when, moving, arboreally, and, hopping, on, both, feet, simultaneously, when, on, the, ground, many, species, of, lizards, become, bipedal, during, high, speed, sprint, locomotion, including, the, world, s, fastest, lizard, the, spiny, tailed, iguana, genus, ctenosaura, the, first, known, biped, is, the, bolosaurid, eudibamus, whose, fossils, date, from, 290, million, years, ago, its, long, hind, legs, short, forelegs, and, distinctive, joints, all, suggest, bipedalism, the, species, became, extinct, in, the, early, permian, all, birds, are, bipeds, as, is, the, case, for, all, theropod, dinosaurs, however, hoatzin, chicks, have, claws, on, their, wings, which, they, use, for, climbing, bipedalism, evolved, more, than, once, in, archosaurs, the, group, that, includes, both, dinosaurs, and, crocodilians, all, dinosaurs, are, thought, to, be, descended, from, a, fully, bipedal, ancestor, perhaps, similar, to, eoraptor, dinosaurs, diverged, from, their, archosaur, ancestors, approximately, 230, million, years, ago, during, the, middle, to, late, triassic, period, roughly, 20, million, years, after, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, wiped, out, an, estimated, 95, percent, of, all, life, on, earth, radiometric, dating, of, fossils, from, the, early, dinosaur, genus, eoraptor, establishes, its, presence, in, the, fossil, record, at, this, time, paleontologists, suspect, eoraptor, resembles, the, common, ancestor, of, all, dinosaurs, if, this, is, true, its, traits, suggest, that, the, first, dinosaurs, were, small, bipedal, predators, the, discovery, of, primitive, dinosaur, like, ornithodirans, such, as, marasuchus, and, lagerpeton, in, argentinian, middle, triassic, strata, supports, this, view, analysis, of, recovered, fossils, suggests, that, these, animals, were, indeed, small, bipedal, predators, bipedal, movement, also, re, evolved, in, a, number, of, other, dinosaur, lineages, such, as, the, iguanodonts, some, extinct, members, of, pseudosuchia, a, sister, group, to, the, avemetatarsalians, the, group, including, dinosaurs, and, relatives, also, evolved, bipedal, forms, a, poposauroid, from, the, triassic, effigia, okeeffeae, is, thought, to, have, been, bipedal, pterosaurs, were, previously, thought, to, have, been, bipedal, but, recent, trackways, have, all, shown, quadrupedal, locomotion, a, number, of, groups, of, extant, mammals, have, independently, evolved, bipedalism, as, their, main, form, of, locomotion, for, example, humans, ground, pangolins, the, extinct, giant, ground, sloths, numerous, species, of, jumping, rodents, and, macropods, humans, as, their, bipedalism, has, been, extensively, studied, are, documented, in, the, next, section, macropods, are, believed, to, have, evolved, bipedal, hopping, only, once, in, their, evolution, at, some, time, no, later, than, 45, million, years, ago, bipedal, movement, is, less, common, among, mammals, most, of, which, are, quadrupedal, all, primates, possess, some, bipedal, ability, though, most, species, primarily, use, quadrupedal, locomotion, on, land, primates, aside, the, macropods, kangaroos, wallabies, and, their, relatives, kangaroo, rats, and, mice, hopping, mice, and, springhare, move, bipedally, by, hopping, very, few, non, primate, mammals, commonly, move, bipedally, with, an, alternating, leg, gait, exceptions, are, the, ground, pangolin, and, in, some, circumstances, the, tree, kangaroo, one, black, bear, pedals, became, famous, locally, and, on, the, internet, for, having, a, frequent, bipedal, gait, although, this, is, attributed, to, injuries, on, the, bear, s, front, paws, a, two, legged, fox, was, filmed, in, a, derbyshire, garden, in, 2023, most, likely, having, been, born, that, way, most, bipedal, animals, move, with, their, backs, close, to, horizontal, using, a, long, tail, to, balance, the, weight, of, their, bodies, the, primate, version, of, bipedalism, is, unusual, because, the, back, is, close, to, upright, completely, upright, in, humans, and, the, tail, may, be, absent, entirely, many, primates, can, stand, upright, on, their, hind, legs, without, any, support, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, gibbons, and, baboons, exhibit, forms, of, bipedalism, on, the, ground, sifakas, move, like, all, indrids, with, bipedal, sideways, hopping, movements, of, the, hind, legs, holding, their, forelimbs, up, for, balance, geladas, although, usually, quadrupedal, will, sometimes, move, between, adjacent, feeding, patches, with, a, squatting, shuffling, bipedal, form, of, locomotion, however, they, can, only, do, so, for, brief, amounts, as, their, bodies, are, not, adapted, for, constant, bipedal, locomotion, humans, are, the, only, primates, who, are, normally, biped, due, to, an, extra, curve, in, the, spine, which, stabilizes, the, upright, position, as, well, as, shorter, arms, relative, to, the, legs, than, is, the, case, for, the, nonhuman, great, apes, the, evolution, of, human, bipedalism, began, in, primates, about, four, million, years, ago, or, as, early, as, seven, million, years, ago, with, sahelanthropus, or, about, 12, million, years, ago, with, danuvius, guggenmosi, one, hypothesis, for, human, bipedalism, is, that, it, evolved, as, a, result, of, differentially, successful, survival, from, carrying, food, to, share, with, group, members, although, there, are, alternative, hypotheses, injured, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, have, been, capable, of, sustained, bipedalism, three, captive, primates, one, macaque, natasha, and, two, chimps, oliver, and, poko, chimpanzee, were, found, to, move, bipedally, natasha, switched, to, exclusive, bipedalism, after, an, illness, while, poko, was, discovered, in, captivity, in, a, tall, narrow, cage, oliver, reverted, to, knuckle, walking, after, developing, arthritis, non, human, primates, often, use, bipedal, locomotion, when, carrying, food, or, while, moving, through, shallow, water, other, mammals, engage, in, limited, non, locomotory, bipedalism, a, number, of, other, animals, such, as, rats, raccoons, and, beavers, will, squat, on, their, hindlegs, to, manipulate, some, objects, but, revert, to, four, limbs, when, moving, the, beaver, will, move, bipedally, if, transporting, wood, for, their, dams, as, will, the, raccoon, when, holding, food, bears, will, fight, in, a, bipedal, stance, to, use, their, forelegs, as, weapons, a, number, of, mammals, will, adopt, a, bipedal, stance, in, specific, situations, such, as, for, feeding, or, fighting, ground, squirrels, and, meerkats, will, stand, on, hind, legs, to, survey, their, surroundings, but, will, not, walk, bipedally, dogs, e, g, faith, can, stand, or, move, on, two, legs, if, trained, or, if, birth, defect, or, injury, precludes, quadrupedalism, the, gerenuk, antelope, stands, on, its, hind, legs, while, eating, from, trees, as, did, the, extinct, giant, ground, sloth, and, chalicotheres, the, spotted, skunk, will, walk, on, its, front, legs, when, threatened, rearing, up, on, its, front, legs, while, facing, the, attacker, so, that, its, anal, glands, capable, of, spraying, an, offensive, oil, face, its, attacker, bipedalism, is, unknown, among, the, amphibians, among, the, non, archosaur, reptiles, bipedalism, is, rare, but, it, is, found, in, the, reared, up, running, of, lizards, such, as, agamids, and, monitor, lizards, many, reptile, species, will, also, temporarily, adopt, bipedalism, while, fighting, one, genus, of, basilisk, lizard, can, run, bipedally, across, the, surface, of, water, for, some, distance, among, arthropods, cockroaches, are, known, to, move, bipedally, at, high, speeds, bipedalism, is, rarely, found, outside, terrestrial, animals, though, at, least, two, species, of, octopus, walk, bipedally, on, the, sea, floor, using, two, of, their, arms, allowing, the, remaining, arms, to, be, used, to, camouflage, the, octopus, as, a, mat, of, algae, or, a, floating, coconut, there, are, at, least, twelve, distinct, hypotheses, as, to, how, and, why, bipedalism, evolved, in, humans, and, also, some, debate, as, to, when, bipedalism, evolved, well, before, the, large, human, brain, or, the, development, of, stone, tools, bipedal, specializations, are, found, in, australopithecus, fossils, from, 4, 2, to, 3, 9, million, years, ago, and, recent, studies, have, suggested, that, obligate, bipedal, hominid, species, were, present, as, early, as, 7, million, years, ago, nonetheless, the, evolution, of, bipedalism, was, accompanied, by, significant, evolutions, in, the, spine, including, the, forward, movement, in, position, of, the, foramen, magnum, where, the, spinal, cord, leaves, the, cranium, recent, evidence, regarding, modern, human, sexual, dimorphism, physical, differences, between, male, and, female, in, the, lumbar, spine, has, been, seen, in, pre, modern, primates, such, as, australopithecus, africanus, this, dimorphism, has, been, seen, as, an, evolutionary, adaptation, of, females, to, bear, lumbar, load, better, during, pregnancy, an, adaptation, that, non, bipedal, primates, would, not, need, to, make, adapting, bipedalism, would, have, required, less, shoulder, stability, which, allowed, the, shoulder, and, other, limbs, to, become, more, independent, of, each, other, and, adapt, for, specific, suspensory, behaviors, in, addition, to, the, change, in, shoulder, stability, changing, locomotion, would, have, increased, the, demand, for, shoulder, mobility, which, would, have, propelled, the, evolution, of, bipedalism, forward, the, different, hypotheses, are, not, necessarily, mutually, exclusive, and, a, number, of, selective, forces, may, have, acted, together, to, lead, to, human, bipedalism, it, is, important, to, distinguish, between, adaptations, for, bipedalism, and, adaptations, for, running, which, came, later, still, the, form, and, function, of, modern, day, humans, upper, bodies, appear, to, have, evolved, from, living, in, a, more, forested, setting, living, in, this, kind, of, environment, would, have, made, it, so, that, being, able, to, travel, arboreally, would, have, been, advantageous, at, the, time, although, different, to, human, walking, bipedal, locomotion, in, trees, was, thought, to, be, advantageous, it, has, also, been, proposed, that, like, some, modern, day, apes, early, hominins, had, undergone, a, knuckle, walking, stage, prior, to, adapting, the, back, limbs, for, bipedality, while, retaining, forearms, capable, of, grasping, numerous, causes, for, the, evolution, of, human, bipedalism, involve, freeing, the, hands, for, carrying, and, using, tools, sexual, dimorphism, in, provisioning, changes, in, climate, and, environment, from, jungle, to, savanna, that, favored, a, more, elevated, eye, position, and, to, reduce, the, amount, of, skin, exposed, to, the, tropical, sun, it, is, possible, that, bipedalism, provided, a, variety, of, benefits, to, the, hominin, species, and, scientists, have, suggested, multiple, reasons, for, evolution, of, human, bipedalism, there, is, also, not, only, the, question, of, why, the, earliest, hominins, were, partially, bipedal, but, also, why, hominins, became, more, bipedal, over, time, for, example, the, postural, feeding, hypothesis, describes, how, the, earliest, hominins, became, bipedal, for, the, benefit, of, reaching, food, in, trees, while, the, savanna, based, theory, describes, how, the, late, hominins, that, started, to, settle, on, the, ground, became, increasingly, bipedal, napier, 1963, argued, that, it, is, unlikely, that, a, single, factor, drove, the, evolution, of, bipedalism, he, stated, it, seems, unlikely, that, any, single, factor, was, responsible, for, such, a, dramatic, change, in, behaviour, in, addition, to, the, advantages, of, accruing, from, ability, to, carry, objects, food, or, otherwise, the, improvement, of, the, visual, range, and, the, freeing, of, the, hands, for, purposes, of, defence, and, offence, may, equally, have, played, their, part, as, catalysts, sigmon, 1971, demonstrated, that, chimpanzees, exhibit, bipedalism, in, different, contexts, and, one, single, factor, should, be, used, to, explain, bipedalism, preadaptation, for, human, bipedalism, day, 1986, emphasized, three, major, pressures, that, drove, evolution, of, bipedalism, food, acquisition, predator, avoidance, and, reproductive, success, ko, 2015, stated, that, there, are, two, questions, main, regarding, bipedalism, 1, why, were, the, earliest, hominins, partially, bipedal, and, 2, why, did, hominins, become, more, bipedal, over, time, he, argued, that, these, questions, can, be, answered, with, combination, of, prominent, theories, such, as, savanna, based, postural, feeding, and, provisioning, according, to, the, savanna, based, theory, hominines, came, down, from, the, tree, s, branches, and, adapted, to, life, on, the, savanna, by, walking, erect, on, two, feet, the, theory, suggests, that, early, hominids, were, forced, to, adapt, to, bipedal, locomotion, on, the, open, savanna, after, they, left, the, trees, one, of, the, proposed, mechanisms, was, the, knuckle, walking, hypothesis, which, states, that, human, ancestors, used, quadrupedal, locomotion, on, the, savanna, as, evidenced, by, morphological, characteristics, found, in, australopithecus, anamensis, and, australopithecus, afarensis, forelimbs, and, that, it, is, less, parsimonious, to, assume, that, knuckle, walking, developed, twice, in, genera, pan, and, gorilla, instead, of, evolving, it, once, as, synapomorphy, for, pan, and, gorilla, before, losing, it, in, australopithecus, the, evolution, of, an, orthograde, posture, would, have, been, very, helpful, on, a, savanna, as, it, would, allow, the, ability, to, look, over, tall, grasses, in, order, to, watch, out, for, predators, or, terrestrially, hunt, and, sneak, up, on, prey, it, was, also, suggested, in, p, e, wheeler, s, the, evolution, of, bipedality, and, loss, of, functional, body, hair, in, hominids, that, a, possible, advantage, of, bipedalism, in, the, savanna, was, reducing, the, amount, of, surface, area, of, the, body, exposed, to, the, sun, helping, regulate, body, temperature, in, fact, elizabeth, vrba, s, turnover, pulse, hypothesis, supports, the, savanna, based, theory, by, explaining, the, shrinking, of, forested, areas, due, to, global, warming, and, cooling, which, forced, animals, out, into, the, open, grasslands, and, caused, the, need, for, hominids, to, acquire, bipedality, others, state, hominines, had, already, achieved, the, bipedal, adaptation, that, was, used, in, the, savanna, the, fossil, evidence, reveals, that, early, bipedal, hominins, were, still, adapted, to, climbing, trees, at, the, time, they, were, also, walking, upright, it, is, possible, that, bipedalism, evolved, in, the, trees, and, was, later, applied, to, the, savanna, as, a, vestigial, trait, humans, and, orangutans, are, both, unique, to, a, bipedal, reactive, adaptation, when, climbing, on, thin, branches, in, which, they, have, increased, hip, and, knee, extension, in, relation, to, the, diameter, of, the, branch, which, can, increase, an, arboreal, feeding, range, and, can, be, attributed, to, a, convergent, evolution, of, bipedalism, evolving, in, arboreal, environments, hominine, fossils, found, in, dry, grassland, environments, led, anthropologists, to, believe, hominines, lived, slept, walked, upright, and, died, only, in, those, environments, because, no, hominine, fossils, were, found, in, forested, areas, however, fossilization, is, a, rare, occurrence, the, conditions, must, be, just, right, in, order, for, an, organism, that, dies, to, become, fossilized, for, somebody, to, find, later, which, is, also, a, rare, occurrence, the, fact, that, no, hominine, fossils, were, found, in, forests, does, not, ultimately, lead, to, the, conclusion, that, no, hominines, ever, died, there, the, convenience, of, the, savanna, based, theory, caused, this, point, to, be, overlooked, for, over, a, hundred, years, some, of, the, fossils, found, actually, showed, that, there, was, still, an, adaptation, to, arboreal, life, for, example, lucy, the, famous, australopithecus, afarensis, found, in, hadar, in, ethiopia, which, may, have, been, forested, at, the, time, of, lucy, s, death, had, curved, fingers, that, would, still, give, her, the, ability, to, grasp, tree, branches, but, she, walked, bipedally, little, foot, a, nearly, complete, specimen, of, australopithecus, africanus, has, a, divergent, big, toe, as, well, as, the, ankle, strength, to, walk, upright, little, foot, could, grasp, things, using, his, feet, like, an, ape, perhaps, tree, branches, and, he, was, bipedal, ancient, pollen, found, in, the, soil, in, the, locations, in, which, these, fossils, were, found, suggest, that, the, area, used, to, be, much, more, wet, and, covered, in, thick, vegetation, and, has, only, recently, become, the, arid, desert, it, is, now, an, alternative, explanation, is, that, the, mixture, of, savanna, and, scattered, forests, increased, terrestrial, travel, by, proto, humans, between, clusters, of, trees, and, bipedalism, offered, greater, efficiency, for, long, distance, travel, between, these, clusters, than, quadrupedalism, in, an, experiment, monitoring, chimpanzee, metabolic, rate, via, oxygen, consumption, it, was, found, that, the, quadrupedal, and, bipedal, energy, costs, were, very, similar, implying, that, this, transition, in, early, ape, like, ancestors, would, not, have, been, very, difficult, or, energetically, costing, this, increased, travel, efficiency, is, likely, to, have, been, selected, for, as, it, assisted, foraging, across, widely, dispersed, resources, the, postural, feeding, hypothesis, has, been, recently, supported, by, dr, kevin, hunt, a, professor, at, indiana, university, this, hypothesis, asserts, that, chimpanzees, were, only, bipedal, when, they, eat, while, on, the, ground, they, would, reach, up, for, fruit, hanging, from, small, trees, and, while, in, trees, bipedalism, was, used, to, reach, up, to, grab, for, an, overhead, branch, these, bipedal, movements, may, have, evolved, into, regular, habits, because, they, were, so, convenient, in, obtaining, food, also, hunt, s, hypotheses, states, that, these, movements, coevolved, with, chimpanzee, arm, hanging, as, this, movement, was, very, effective, and, efficient, in, harvesting, food, when, analyzing, fossil, anatomy, australopithecus, afarensis, has, very, similar, features, of, the, hand, and, shoulder, to, the, chimpanzee, which, indicates, hanging, arms, also, the, australopithecus, hip, and, hind, limb, very, clearly, indicate, bipedalism, but, these, fossils, also, indicate, very, inefficient, locomotive, movement, when, compared, to, humans, for, this, reason, hunt, argues, that, bipedalism, evolved, more, as, a, terrestrial, feeding, posture, than, as, a, walking, posture, a, related, study, conducted, by, university, of, birmingham, professor, susannah, thorpe, examined, the, most, arboreal, great, ape, the, orangutan, holding, onto, supporting, branches, in, order, to, navigate, branches, that, were, too, flexible, or, unstable, otherwise, in, more, than, 75, percent, of, observations, the, orangutans, used, their, forelimbs, to, stabilize, themselves, while, navigating, thinner, branches, increased, fragmentation, of, forests, where, a, afarensis, as, well, as, other, ancestors, of, modern, humans, and, other, apes, resided, could, have, contributed, to, this, increase, of, bipedalism, in, order, to, navigate, the, diminishing, forests, findings, also, could, shed, light, on, discrepancies, observed, in, the, anatomy, of, a, afarensis, such, as, the, ankle, joint, which, allowed, it, to, wobble, and, long, highly, flexible, forelimbs, if, bipedalism, started, from, upright, navigation, in, trees, it, could, explain, both, increased, flexibility, in, the, ankle, as, well, as, long, forelimbs, which, grab, hold, of, branches, one, theory, on, the, origin, of, bipedalism, is, the, behavioral, model, presented, by, c, owen, lovejoy, known, as, male, provisioning, lovejoy, theorizes, that, the, evolution, of, bipedalism, was, linked, to, monogamy, in, the, face, of, long, inter, birth, intervals, and, low, reproductive, rates, typical, of, the, apes, early, hominids, engaged, in, pair, bonding, that, enabled, greater, parental, effort, directed, towards, rearing, offspring, lovejoy, proposes, that, male, provisioning, of, food, would, improve, the, offspring, survivorship, and, increase, the, pair, s, reproductive, rate, thus, the, male, would, leave, his, mate, and, offspring, to, search, for, food, and, return, carrying, the, food, in, his, arms, walking, on, his, legs, this, model, is, supported, by, the, reduction, feminization, of, the, male, canine, teeth, in, early, hominids, such, as, sahelanthropus, tchadensis, and, ardipithecus, ramidus, which, along, with, low, body, size, dimorphism, in, ardipithecus, and, australopithecus, suggests, a, reduction, in, inter, male, antagonistic, behavior, in, early, hominids, in, addition, this, model, is, supported, by, a, number, of, modern, human, traits, associated, with, concealed, ovulation, permanently, enlarged, breasts, lack, of, sexual, swelling, and, low, sperm, competition, moderate, sized, testes, low, sperm, mid, piece, volume, that, argues, against, recent, adaptation, to, a, polygynous, reproductive, system, however, this, model, has, been, debated, as, others, have, argued, that, early, bipedal, hominids, were, instead, polygynous, among, most, monogamous, primates, males, and, females, are, about, the, same, size, that, is, sexual, dimorphism, is, minimal, and, other, studies, have, suggested, that, australopithecus, afarensis, males, were, nearly, twice, the, weight, of, females, however, lovejoy, s, model, posits, that, the, larger, range, a, provisioning, male, would, have, to, cover, to, avoid, competing, with, the, female, for, resources, she, could, attain, herself, would, select, for, increased, male, body, size, to, limit, predation, risk, furthermore, as, the, species, became, more, bipedal, specialized, feet, would, prevent, the, infant, from, conveniently, clinging, to, the, mother, hampering, the, mother, s, freedom, and, thus, make, her, and, her, offspring, more, dependent, on, resources, collected, by, others, modern, monogamous, primates, such, as, gibbons, tend, to, be, also, territorial, but, fossil, evidence, indicates, that, australopithecus, afarensis, lived, in, large, groups, however, while, both, gibbons, and, hominids, have, reduced, canine, sexual, dimorphism, female, gibbons, enlarge, masculinize, their, canines, so, they, can, actively, share, in, the, defense, of, their, home, territory, instead, the, reduction, of, the, male, hominid, canine, is, consistent, with, reduced, inter, male, aggression, in, a, pair, bonded, though, group, living, primate, recent, studies, of, 4, 4, million, years, old, ardipithecus, ramidus, suggest, bipedalism, it, is, thus, possible, that, bipedalism, evolved, very, early, in, homininae, and, was, reduced, in, chimpanzee, and, gorilla, when, they, became, more, specialized, other, recent, studies, of, the, foot, structure, of, ardipithecus, ramidus, suggest, that, the, species, was, closely, related, to, african, ape, ancestors, this, possibly, provides, a, species, close, to, the, true, connection, between, fully, bipedal, hominins, and, quadruped, apes, according, to, richard, dawkins, in, his, book, the, ancestor, s, tale, chimps, and, bonobos, are, descended, from, australopithecus, gracile, type, species, while, gorillas, are, descended, from, paranthropus, these, apes, may, have, once, been, bipedal, but, then, lost, this, ability, when, they, were, forced, back, into, an, arboreal, habitat, presumably, by, those, australopithecines, from, whom, eventually, evolved, hominins, early, hominines, such, as, ardipithecus, ramidus, may, have, possessed, an, arboreal, type, of, bipedalism, that, later, independently, evolved, towards, knuckle, walking, in, chimpanzees, and, gorillas, and, towards, efficient, walking, and, running, in, modern, humans, see, figure, it, is, also, proposed, that, one, cause, of, neanderthal, extinction, was, a, less, efficient, running, joseph, jordania, from, the, university, of, melbourne, recently, 2011, suggested, that, bipedalism, was, one, of, the, central, elements, of, the, general, defense, strategy, of, early, hominids, based, on, aposematism, or, warning, display, and, intimidation, of, potential, predators, and, competitors, with, exaggerated, visual, and, audio, signals, according, to, this, model, hominids, were, trying, to, stay, as, visible, and, as, loud, as, possible, all, the, time, several, morphological, and, behavioral, developments, were, employed, to, achieve, this, goal, upright, bipedal, posture, longer, legs, long, tightly, coiled, hair, on, the, top, of, the, head, body, painting, threatening, synchronous, body, movements, loud, voice, and, extremely, loud, rhythmic, singing, stomping, drumming, on, external, subjects, slow, locomotion, and, strong, body, odor, both, characteristic, for, hominids, and, humans, are, other, features, often, employed, by, aposematic, species, to, advertise, their, non, profitability, for, potential, predators, there, are, a, variety, of, ideas, which, promote, a, specific, change, in, behaviour, as, the, key, driver, for, the, evolution, of, hominid, bipedalism, for, example, wescott, 1967, and, later, jablonski, chaplin, 1993, suggest, that, bipedal, threat, displays, could, have, been, the, transitional, behaviour, which, led, to, some, groups, of, apes, beginning, to, adopt, bipedal, postures, more, often, others, e, g, dart, 1925, have, offered, the, idea, that, the, need, for, more, vigilance, against, predators, could, have, provided, the, initial, motivation, dawkins, e, g, 2004, has, argued, that, it, could, have, begun, as, a, kind, of, fashion, that, just, caught, on, and, then, escalated, through, sexual, selection, and, it, has, even, been, suggested, e, g, tanner, 1981, 165, that, male, phallic, display, could, have, been, the, initial, incentive, as, well, as, increased, sexual, signaling, in, upright, female, posture, the, thermoregulatory, model, explaining, the, origin, of, bipedalism, is, one, of, the, simplest, theories, so, far, advanced, but, it, is, a, viable, explanation, dr, peter, wheeler, a, professor, of, evolutionary, biology, proposes, that, bipedalism, raises, the, amount, of, body, surface, area, higher, above, the, ground, which, results, in, a, reduction, in, heat, gain, and, helps, heat, dissipation, when, a, hominid, is, higher, above, the, ground, the, organism, accesses, more, favorable, wind, speeds, and, temperatures, during, heat, seasons, greater, wind, flow, results, in, a, higher, heat, loss, which, makes, the, organism, more, comfortable, also, wheeler, explains, that, a, vertical, posture, minimizes, the, direct, exposure, to, the, sun, whereas, quadrupedalism, exposes, more, of, the, body, to, direct, exposure, analysis, and, interpretations, of, ardipithecus, reveal, that, this, hypothesis, needs, modification, to, consider, that, the, forest, and, woodland, environmental, preadaptation, of, early, stage, hominid, bipedalism, preceded, further, refinement, of, bipedalism, by, the, pressure, of, natural, selection, this, then, allowed, for, the, more, efficient, exploitation, of, the, hotter, conditions, ecological, niche, rather, than, the, hotter, conditions, being, hypothetically, bipedalism, s, initial, stimulus, a, feedback, mechanism, from, the, advantages, of, bipedality, in, hot, and, open, habitats, would, then, in, turn, make, a, forest, preadaptation, solidify, as, a, permanent, state, charles, darwin, wrote, that, man, could, not, have, attained, his, present, dominant, position, in, the, world, without, the, use, of, his, hands, which, are, so, admirably, adapted, to, the, act, of, obedience, of, his, will, darwin, 1871, 52, and, many, models, on, bipedal, origins, are, based, on, this, line, of, thought, gordon, hewes, 1961, suggested, that, the, carrying, of, meat, over, considerable, distances, hewes, 1961, 689, was, the, key, factor, isaac, 1978, and, sinclair, et, al, 1986, offered, modifications, of, this, idea, as, indeed, did, lovejoy, 1981, with, his, provisioning, model, described, above, others, such, as, nancy, tanner, 1981, have, suggested, that, infant, carrying, was, key, while, others, again, have, suggested, stone, tools, and, weapons, drove, the, change, this, stone, tools, theory, is, very, unlikely, as, though, ancient, humans, were, known, to, hunt, the, discovery, of, tools, was, not, discovered, for, thousands, of, years, after, the, origin, of, bipedalism, chronologically, precluding, it, from, being, a, driving, force, of, evolution, wooden, tools, and, spears, fossilize, poorly, and, therefore, it, is, difficult, to, make, a, judgment, about, their, potential, usage, the, observation, that, large, primates, including, especially, the, great, apes, that, predominantly, move, quadrupedally, on, dry, land, tend, to, switch, to, bipedal, locomotion, in, waist, deep, water, has, led, to, the, idea, that, the, origin, of, human, bipedalism, may, have, been, influenced, by, waterside, environments, this, idea, labelled, the, wading, hypothesis, was, originally, suggested, by, the, oxford, marine, biologist, alister, hardy, who, said, it, seems, to, me, likely, that, man, learnt, to, stand, erect, first, in, water, and, then, as, his, balance, improved, he, found, he, became, better, equipped, for, standing, up, on, the, shore, when, he, came, out, and, indeed, also, for, running, it, was, then, promoted, by, elaine, morgan, as, part, of, the, aquatic, ape, hypothesis, who, cited, bipedalism, among, a, cluster, of, other, human, traits, unique, among, primates, including, voluntary, control, of, breathing, hairlessness, and, subcutaneous, fat, the, aquatic, ape, hypothesis, as, originally, formulated, has, not, been, accepted, or, considered, a, serious, theory, within, the, anthropological, scholarly, community, others, however, have, sought, to, promote, wading, as, a, factor, in, the, origin, of, human, bipedalism, without, referring, to, further, aquatic, ape, related, factors, since, 2000, carsten, niemitz, has, published, a, series, of, papers, and, a, book, on, a, variant, of, the, wading, hypothesis, which, he, calls, the, amphibian, generalist, theory, german, amphibische, generalistentheorie, other, theories, have, been, proposed, that, suggest, wading, and, the, exploitation, of, aquatic, food, sources, providing, essential, nutrients, for, human, brain, evolution, or, critical, fallback, foods, may, have, exerted, evolutionary, pressures, on, human, ancestors, promoting, adaptations, which, later, assisted, full, time, bipedalism, it, has, also, been, thought, that, consistent, water, based, food, sources, had, developed, early, hominid, dependency, and, facilitated, dispersal, along, seas, and, rivers, prehistoric, fossil, records, show, that, early, hominins, first, developed, bipedalism, before, being, followed, by, an, increase, in, brain, size, the, consequences, of, these, two, changes, in, particular, resulted, in, painful, and, difficult, labor, due, to, the, increased, favor, of, a, narrow, pelvis, for, bipedalism, being, countered, by, larger, heads, passing, through, the, constricted, birth, canal, this, phenomenon, is, commonly, known, as, the, obstetrical, dilemma, non, human, primates, habitually, deliver, their, young, on, their, own, but, the, same, cannot, be, said, for, modern, day, humans, isolated, birth, appears, to, be, rare, and, actively, avoided, cross, culturally, even, if, birthing, methods, may, differ, between, said, cultures, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, the, narrowing, of, the, hips, and, the, change, in, the, pelvic, angle, caused, a, discrepancy, in, the, ratio, of, the, size, of, the, head, to, the, birth, canal, the, result, of, this, is, that, there, is, greater, difficulty, in, birthing, for, hominins, in, general, let, alone, to, be, doing, it, by, oneself, bipedal, movement, occurs, in, a, number, of, ways, and, requires, many, mechanical, and, neurological, adaptations, some, of, these, are, described, below, energy, efficient, means, of, standing, bipedally, involve, constant, adjustment, of, balance, and, of, course, these, must, avoid, overcorrection, the, difficulties, associated, with, simple, standing, in, upright, humans, are, highlighted, by, the, greatly, increased, risk, of, falling, present, in, the, elderly, even, with, minimal, reductions, in, control, system, effectiveness, shoulder, stability, would, decrease, with, the, evolution, of, bipedalism, shoulder, mobility, would, increase, because, the, need, for, a, stable, shoulder, is, only, present, in, arboreal, habitats, shoulder, mobility, would, support, suspensory, locomotion, behaviors, which, are, present, in, human, bipedalism, the, forelimbs, are, freed, from, weight, bearing, requirements, which, makes, the, shoulder, a, place, of, evidence, for, the, evolution, of, bipedalism, unlike, non, human, apes, that, are, able, to, practice, bipedality, such, as, pan, and, gorilla, hominins, have, the, ability, to, move, bipedally, without, the, utilization, of, a, bent, hip, bent, knee, bhbk, gait, which, requires, the, engagement, of, both, the, hip, and, the, knee, joints, this, human, ability, to, walk, is, made, possible, by, the, spinal, curvature, humans, have, that, non, human, apes, do, not, rather, walking, is, characterized, by, an, inverted, pendulum, movement, in, which, the, center, of, gravity, vaults, over, a, stiff, leg, with, each, step, force, plates, can, be, used, to, quantify, the, whole, body, kinetic, potential, energy, with, walking, displaying, an, out, of, phase, relationship, indicating, exchange, between, the, two, this, model, applies, to, all, walking, organisms, regardless, of, the, number, of, legs, and, thus, bipedal, locomotion, does, not, differ, in, terms, of, whole, body, kinetics, in, humans, walking, is, composed, of, several, separate, processes, early, hominins, underwent, post, cranial, changes, in, order, to, better, adapt, to, bipedality, especially, running, one, of, these, changes, is, having, longer, hindlimbs, proportional, to, the, forelimbs, and, their, effects, as, previously, mentioned, longer, hindlimbs, assist, in, thermoregulation, by, reducing, the, total, surface, area, exposed, to, direct, sunlight, while, simultaneously, allowing, for, more, space, for, cooling, winds, additionally, having, longer, limbs, is, more, energy, efficient, since, longer, limbs, mean, that, overall, muscle, strain, is, lessened, better, energy, efficiency, in, turn, means, higher, endurance, particularly, when, running, long, distances, running, is, characterized, by, a, spring, mass, movement, kinetic, and, potential, energy, are, in, phase, and, the, energy, is, stored, released, from, a, spring, like, limb, during, foot, contact, achieved, by, the, plantar, arch, and, the, achilles, tendon, in, the, foot, and, leg, respectively, again, the, whole, body, kinetics, are, similar, to, animals, with, more, limbs, bipedalism, requires, strong, leg, muscles, particularly, in, the, thighs, contrast, in, domesticated, poultry, the, well, muscled, legs, against, the, small, and, bony, wings, likewise, in, humans, the, quadriceps, and, hamstring, muscles, of, the, thigh, are, both, so, crucial, to, bipedal, activities, that, each, alone, is, much, larger, than, the, well, developed, biceps, of, the, arms, in, addition, to, the, leg, muscles, the, increased, size, of, the, gluteus, maximus, in, humans, is, an, important, adaptation, as, it, provides, support, and, stability, to, the, trunk, and, lessens, the, amount, of, stress, on, the, joints, when, running, quadrupeds, have, more, restrictive, breathing, respire, while, moving, than, do, bipedal, humans, quadrupedal, species, normally, synchronize, the, locomotor, and, respiratory, cycles, at, a, constant, ratio, of, 1, 1, strides, per, breath, in, both, the, trot, and, gallop, human, runners, differ, from, quadrupeds, in, that, while, running, they, employ, several, phase, locked, patterns, 4, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2, and, 3, 2, although, a, 2, 1, coupling, ratio, appears, to, be, favored, even, though, the, evolution, of, bipedal, gait, has, reduced, the, mechanical, constraints, on, respiration, in, man, thereby, permitting, greater, flexibility, in, breathing, pattern, it, has, seemingly, not, eliminated, the, need, for, the, synchronization, of, respiration, and, body, motion, during, sustained, running, respiration, through, bipedality, means, that, there, is, better, breath, control, in, bipeds, which, can, be, associated, with, brain, growth, the, modern, brain, utilizes, approximately, 20, of, energy, input, gained, through, breathing, and, eating, as, opposed, to, species, like, chimpanzees, who, use, up, twice, as, much, energy, as, humans, for, the, same, amount, of, movement, this, excess, energy, leading, to, brain, growth, also, leads, to, the, development, of, verbal, communication, this, is, because, breath, control, means, that, the, muscles, associated, with, breathing, can, be, manipulated, into, creating, sounds, this, means, that, the, onset, of, bipedality, leading, to, more, efficient, breathing, may, be, related, to, the, origin, of, verbal, language, for, nearly, the, whole, of, the, 20th, century, bipedal, robots, were, very, difficult, to, construct, and, robot, locomotion, involved, only, wheels, treads, or, multiple, legs, recent, cheap, and, compact, computing, power, has, made, two, legged, robots, more, feasible, some, notable, biped, robots, are, asimo, hubo, mabel, and, qrio, recently, spurred, by, the, success, of, creating, a, fully, passive, un, powered, bipedal, walking, robot, those, working, on, such, machines, have, begun, using, principles, gleaned, from, the, study, of, human, and, animal, locomotion, which, often, relies, on, passive, mechanisms, to, minimize, power, consumption
