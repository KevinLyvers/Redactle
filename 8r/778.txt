the, term, antelope, refers, to, numerous, extant, or, recently, extinct, species, of, the, ruminant, artiodactyl, family, bovidae, that, are, indigenous, to, most, of, africa, india, the, middle, east, central, asia, and, a, small, area, of, eastern, europe, antelopes, do, not, form, a, monophyletic, group, as, some, antelopes, are, more, closely, related, to, other, bovid, groups, like, bovines, goats, and, sheep, than, to, other, antelopes, a, better, definition, also, known, as, the, true, antelopes, includes, only, the, genera, gazella, nanger, eudorcas, and, antilope, one, north, american, mammal, the, pronghorn, or, pronghorn, antelope, is, colloquially, referred, to, as, the, american, antelope, despite, the, fact, that, it, belongs, to, a, completely, different, family, antilocapridae, than, the, true, old, world, antelopes, pronghorn, are, the, sole, extant, member, of, an, extinct, prehistoric, lineage, that, once, included, many, unique, species, although, antelope, are, sometimes, referred, to, and, easily, misidentified, as, deer, cervids, true, deer, are, only, distantly, related, to, antelope, while, antelope, are, found, in, abundance, in, africa, only, one, deer, species, is, found, on, the, continent, the, barbary, red, deer, of, northern, africa, by, comparison, numerous, deer, species, are, usually, found, in, regions, of, the, world, with, fewer, or, no, antelope, species, present, such, as, throughout, southeast, asia, europe, and, all, of, the, americas, this, is, likely, due, to, competition, over, shared, resources, as, deer, and, antelope, fill, a, virtually, identical, ecological, niche, in, their, respective, habitats, countries, like, india, however, have, large, populations, of, endemic, deer, and, antelope, with, the, different, species, generally, keeping, to, their, own, niches, with, minimal, overlap, unlike, deer, in, which, the, males, sport, elaborate, head, antlers, that, are, shed, and, regrown, annually, antelope, horns, are, bone, and, grow, steadily, never, falling, off, if, a, horn, is, broken, it, will, either, remain, broken, or, take, years, to, partially, regenerate, depending, on, the, species, the, english, word, antelope, first, appeared, in, 1417, and, is, derived, from, the, old, french, antelop, itself, derived, from, medieval, latin, ant, h, alopus, which, in, turn, comes, from, the, byzantine, greek, word, anth, lops, first, attested, in, eustathius, of, antioch, c, 336, according, to, whom, it, was, a, fabulous, animal, haunting, the, banks, of, the, euphrates, very, savage, hard, to, catch, and, having, long, saw, like, horns, capable, of, cutting, down, trees, it, perhaps, derives, from, greek, anthos, flower, and, ops, eye, perhaps, meaning, beautiful, eye, or, alluding, to, the, animals, long, eyelashes, this, however, may, be, a, folk, etymology, in, greek, based, on, some, earlier, root, the, word, talopus, and, calopus, from, latin, came, to, be, used, in, heraldry, in, 1607, it, was, first, used, for, living, cervine, animals, there, are, 91, antelope, species, most, of, which, are, native, to, africa, occur, in, about, 30, genera, the, classification, of, tribes, or, subfamilies, within, bovoidea, is, still, a, matter, of, debate, with, several, alternative, systems, proposed, antelope, are, not, a, cladistic, or, taxonomically, defined, group, the, term, is, used, to, describe, all, members, of, the, family, bovidae, that, do, not, fall, under, the, category, of, sheep, cattle, or, goats, usually, all, species, of, the, antilopinae, hippotraginae, reduncinae, cephalophinae, many, bovinae, the, grey, rhebok, and, the, impala, are, called, antelope, more, species, of, antelope, are, native, to, africa, than, to, any, other, continent, almost, exclusively, in, savannahs, with, 25, 40, species, co, occurring, over, much, of, east, africa, because, savannah, habitat, in, africa, has, expanded, and, contracted, five, times, over, the, last, three, million, years, and, the, fossil, record, indicates, this, is, when, most, extant, species, evolved, it, is, believed, that, isolation, in, refugia, during, contractions, was, a, major, driver, of, this, diversification, other, species, occur, in, asia, the, arabian, peninsula, is, home, to, the, arabian, oryx, and, dorcas, gazelle, india, is, home, to, the, nilgai, chinkara, blackbuck, tibetan, antelope, and, four, horned, antelope, while, russia, and, central, asia, have, the, tibetan, antelope, and, saiga, no, antelope, species, is, native, to, australasia, or, antarctica, nor, do, any, extant, species, occur, in, the, americas, though, the, nominate, saiga, subspecies, occurred, in, north, america, during, the, pleistocene, north, america, is, currently, home, to, the, native, pronghorn, which, taxonomists, do, not, consider, a, member, of, the, antelope, group, but, which, is, often, locally, referred, to, as, such, e, g, american, antelope, in, europe, several, extinct, species, occur, in, the, fossil, record, and, the, saiga, was, found, widely, during, the, pleistocene, but, did, not, persist, into, the, later, holocene, except, in, russian, kalmykia, and, astrakhan, oblast, many, species, of, antelope, have, been, imported, to, other, parts, of, the, world, especially, the, united, states, for, exotic, game, hunting, with, some, species, possessing, spectacular, leaping, and, evasive, skills, individuals, may, escape, texas, in, particular, has, many, game, ranches, as, well, as, habitats, and, climates, that, are, very, hospitable, to, african, and, asian, plains, antelope, species, accordingly, wild, populations, of, blackbuck, antelope, gemsbok, and, nilgai, may, be, found, in, texas, antelope, live, in, a, wide, range, of, habitats, most, live, in, the, african, savannahs, however, many, species, are, more, secluded, such, as, the, forest, antelope, as, well, as, the, extreme, cold, living, saiga, the, desert, adapted, arabian, oryx, the, rocky, koppie, living, klipspringer, and, semiaquatic, sitatunga, species, living, in, forests, woodland, or, bush, tend, to, be, sedentary, but, many, of, the, plains, species, undertake, long, migrations, these, enable, grass, eating, species, to, follow, the, rains, and, thereby, their, food, supply, the, gnus, and, gazelles, of, east, africa, perform, some, of, the, most, impressive, mass, migratory, circuits, of, all, mammals, antelope, vary, greatly, in, size, for, example, a, male, common, eland, can, measure, 178, cm, 5, ft, 10, in, at, the, shoulder, and, weigh, almost, 950, kg, 2, 100, lb, whereas, an, adult, royal, antelope, may, stand, only, 24, cm, 9, 1, 2, in, at, the, shoulder, and, weigh, a, mere, 1, 5, kg, 3, 1, 4, lb, not, surprisingly, for, animals, with, long, slender, yet, powerful, legs, many, antelope, have, long, strides, and, can, run, fast, some, e, g, klipspringer, are, also, adapted, to, inhabiting, rock, koppies, and, crags, both, dibatags, and, gerenuks, habitually, stand, on, their, two, hind, legs, to, reach, acacia, and, other, tree, foliage, different, antelope, have, different, body, types, which, can, affect, movement, duikers, are, short, bush, dwelling, antelope, that, can, pick, through, dense, foliage, and, dive, into, the, shadows, rapidly, gazelle, and, springbok, are, known, for, their, speed, and, leaping, abilities, even, larger, antelope, such, as, nilgai, elands, and, kudus, are, capable, of, jumping, 2, 4, m, 7, ft, 10, in, or, greater, although, their, running, speed, is, restricted, by, their, greater, mass, antelope, have, a, wide, variety, of, coverings, though, most, have, a, dense, coat, of, short, fur, in, most, species, the, coat, pelage, is, some, variation, of, a, brown, colour, or, several, shades, of, brown, often, with, white, or, pale, underbodies, exceptions, include, the, zebra, marked, zebra, duiker, the, grey, black, and, white, jentink, s, duiker, and, the, black, lechwe, most, of, the, spiral, horned, antelope, have, pale, vertical, stripes, on, their, backs, many, desert, and, semidesert, species, are, particularly, pale, some, almost, silvery, or, whitish, e, g, arabian, oryx, the, beisa, and, southern, oryxes, have, gray, and, black, pelages, with, vivid, black, and, white, faces, common, features, of, various, gazelles, are, white, rumps, which, flash, a, warning, to, others, when, they, run, from, danger, and, dark, stripes, midbody, the, latter, feature, is, also, shared, by, the, springbok, and, beira, the, springbok, also, has, a, pouch, of, white, brushlike, hairs, running, along, its, back, which, opens, up, when, the, animal, senses, danger, causing, the, dorsal, hairs, to, stand, on, end, antelope, are, ruminants, so, have, well, developed, molar, teeth, which, grind, cud, food, balls, stored, in, the, stomach, into, a, pulp, for, further, digestion, they, have, no, upper, incisors, but, rather, a, hard, upper, gum, pad, against, which, their, lower, incisors, bite, to, tear, grass, stems, and, leaves, like, many, other, herbivores, antelope, rely, on, keen, senses, to, avoid, predators, their, eyes, are, placed, on, the, sides, of, their, heads, giving, them, a, broad, radius, of, vision, with, minimal, binocular, vision, their, horizontally, elongated, pupils, also, help, in, this, respect, acute, senses, of, smell, and, hearing, give, antelope, the, ability, to, perceive, danger, at, night, out, in, the, open, when, predators, are, often, on, the, prowl, these, same, senses, play, an, important, role, in, contact, between, individuals, of, the, same, species, markings, on, their, heads, ears, legs, and, rumps, are, used, in, such, communication, many, species, flash, such, markings, as, well, as, their, tails, vocal, communications, include, loud, barks, whistles, moos, and, trumpeting, many, species, also, use, scent, marking, to, define, their, territories, or, simply, to, maintain, contact, with, their, relatives, and, neighbors, many, antelope, are, sexually, dimorphic, in, most, species, both, sexes, have, horns, but, those, of, males, tend, to, be, larger, males, tend, to, be, larger, than, the, females, but, exceptions, in, which, the, females, tend, to, be, heavier, than, the, males, include, the, bush, duiker, dwarf, antelope, cape, grysbok, and, oribi, all, rather, small, species, a, number, of, species, have, hornless, females, e, g, sitatunga, red, lechwe, and, suni, in, some, species, the, males, and, females, have, differently, coloured, pelages, e, g, blackbuck, and, nyala, the, size, and, shape, of, antelope, horns, varies, greatly, those, of, the, duikers, and, dwarf, antelope, tend, to, be, simple, spikes, but, differ, in, the, angle, to, the, head, from, backward, curved, and, backward, pointing, e, g, yellow, backed, duiker, to, straight, and, upright, e, g, steenbok, other, groups, have, twisted, e, g, common, eland, spiral, e, g, greater, kudu, recurved, e, g, the, reedbucks, lyrate, e, g, impala, or, long, curved, e, g, the, oryxes, horns, horns, are, not, shed, and, their, bony, cores, are, covered, with, a, thick, persistent, sheath, of, horny, material, both, of, which, distinguish, them, from, antlers, horns, are, efficient, weapons, and, tend, to, be, better, developed, in, those, species, where, males, fight, over, females, large, herd, antelope, than, in, solitary, or, lekking, species, with, male, male, competition, for, mates, horns, are, clashed, in, combat, males, more, commonly, use, their, horns, against, each, other, than, against, another, species, the, boss, of, the, horns, is, typically, arranged, in, such, a, way, that, two, antelope, striking, at, each, other, s, horns, cannot, crack, each, other, s, skulls, making, a, fight, via, horn, more, ritualized, than, dangerous, many, species, have, ridges, in, their, horns, for, at, least, two, thirds, the, length, of, their, horns, but, these, ridges, are, not, a, direct, indicator, of, age, antelope, are, often, classified, by, their, reproductive, behavior, small, antelope, such, as, dik, diks, tend, to, be, monogamous, they, live, in, a, forest, environment, with, patchy, resources, and, a, male, is, unable, to, monopolize, more, than, one, female, due, to, this, sparse, distribution, larger, forest, species, often, form, very, small, herds, of, two, to, four, females, and, one, male, some, species, such, as, lechwes, pursue, a, lek, breeding, system, where, the, males, gather, on, a, lekking, ground, and, compete, for, a, small, territory, while, the, females, appraise, males, and, choose, one, with, which, to, mate, large, grazing, antelope, such, as, impala, or, wildebeest, form, large, herds, made, up, of, many, females, and, a, single, breeding, male, which, excludes, all, other, males, often, by, combat, antelope, pursue, a, number, of, defense, strategies, often, dictated, by, their, morphology, large, antelope, that, gather, in, large, herds, such, as, wildebeest, rely, on, numbers, and, running, speed, for, protection, in, some, species, adults, will, encircle, the, offspring, protecting, them, from, predators, when, threatened, many, forest, antelope, rely, on, cryptic, coloring, and, good, hearing, to, avoid, predators, forest, antelope, often, have, very, large, ears, and, dark, or, striped, colorations, small, antelope, especially, duikers, evade, predation, by, jumping, into, dense, bush, where, the, predator, cannot, pursue, springboks, use, a, behavior, known, as, stotting, to, confuse, predators, open, grassland, species, have, nowhere, to, hide, from, predators, so, they, tend, to, be, fast, runners, they, are, agile, and, have, good, endurance, these, are, advantages, when, pursued, by, sprint, dependent, predators, such, as, cheetahs, which, are, the, fastest, of, land, animals, but, tire, quickly, reaction, distances, vary, with, predator, species, and, behaviour, for, example, gazelles, may, not, flee, from, a, lion, until, it, is, closer, than, 200, m, 650, ft, lions, hunt, as, a, pride, or, by, surprise, usually, by, stalking, one, that, can, be, seen, clearly, is, unlikely, to, attack, however, sprint, dependent, cheetahs, will, cause, gazelles, to, flee, at, a, range, of, over, 800, metres, 1, 2, mile, if, escape, is, not, an, option, antelope, are, capable, of, fighting, back, oryxes, in, particular, have, been, known, to, stand, sideways, like, many, unrelated, bovids, to, appear, larger, than, they, are, and, may, charge, at, a, predator, as, a, last, resort, about, 25, species, are, rated, by, the, iucn, as, endangered, such, as, the, dama, gazelle, and, mountain, nyala, a, number, of, subspecies, are, also, endangered, including, the, giant, sable, antelope, and, the, mhorr, gazelle, the, main, causes, for, concern, for, these, species, are, habitat, loss, competition, with, cattle, for, grazing, and, trophy, hunting, the, chiru, or, tibetan, antelope, is, hunted, for, its, pelt, which, is, used, in, making, shahtoosh, wool, used, in, shawls, since, the, fur, can, only, be, removed, from, dead, animals, and, each, animal, yields, very, little, of, the, downy, fur, several, antelope, must, be, killed, to, make, a, single, shawl, this, unsustainable, demand, has, led, to, enormous, declines, in, the, chiru, population, the, saiga, is, hunted, for, its, horns, which, are, considered, an, aphrodisiac, by, some, cultures, only, the, males, have, horns, and, have, been, so, heavily, hunted, that, some, herds, contain, up, to, 800, females, to, one, male, the, species, has, shown, a, steep, decline, and, is, critically, endangered, it, is, difficult, to, determine, how, long, antelope, live, in, the, wild, with, the, preference, of, predators, towards, old, and, infirm, individuals, which, can, no, longer, sustain, peak, speeds, few, wild, prey, animals, live, as, long, as, their, biological, potential, in, captivity, wildebeest, have, lived, beyond, 20, years, old, and, impalas, have, reached, their, late, teens, the, antelope, s, horn, is, prized, for, supposed, medicinal, and, magical, powers, in, many, places, the, horn, of, the, male, saiga, in, eastern, practice, is, ground, as, an, aphrodisiac, for, which, it, has, been, hunted, nearly, to, extinction, in, the, congo, it, is, thought, to, confine, spirits, the, antelope, s, ability, to, run, swiftly, has, also, led, to, their, association, with, the, wind, such, as, in, the, rig, veda, as, the, steeds, of, the, maruts, and, the, wind, god, vayu, there, is, however, no, scientific, evidence, that, the, horns, of, any, antelope, have, any, change, on, a, human, s, physiology, or, characteristics, in, mali, antelope, were, believed, to, have, brought, the, skills, of, agriculture, to, mankind, humans, have, also, used, the, term, antelope, to, refer, to, a, tradition, usually, found, in, the, sport, of, track, and, field, domestication, of, animals, requires, certain, traits, in, the, animal, that, antelope, do, not, typically, display, most, species, are, difficult, to, contain, in, any, density, due, to, the, territoriality, of, the, males, or, in, the, case, of, oryxes, which, have, a, relatively, hierarchical, social, structure, an, aggressive, disposition, they, can, easily, kill, a, human, because, many, have, extremely, good, jumping, abilities, providing, adequate, fencing, is, a, challenge, also, antelope, will, consistently, display, a, fear, response, to, perceived, predators, such, as, humans, making, them, very, difficult, to, herd, or, handle, although, antelope, have, diets, and, rapid, growth, rates, highly, suitable, for, domestication, this, tendency, to, panic, and, their, non, hierarchical, social, structure, explains, why, farm, raised, antelope, are, uncommon, ancient, egyptians, kept, herds, of, gazelles, and, addax, for, meat, and, occasionally, pets, it, is, unknown, whether, they, were, truly, domesticated, but, it, seems, unlikely, as, no, domesticated, gazelles, exist, today, however, humans, have, had, success, taming, certain, species, such, as, the, elands, these, antelope, sometimes, jump, over, each, other, s, backs, when, alarmed, but, this, incongruous, talent, seems, to, be, exploited, only, by, wild, members, of, the, species, tame, elands, do, not, take, advantage, of, it, and, can, be, enclosed, within, a, very, low, fence, their, meat, milk, and, hides, are, all, of, excellent, quality, and, experimental, eland, husbandry, has, been, going, on, for, some, years, in, both, ukraine, and, zimbabwe, in, both, locations, the, animal, has, proved, wholly, amenable, to, domestication, similarly, european, visitors, to, arabia, reported, tame, gazelles, are, very, common, in, the, asiatic, countries, of, which, the, species, is, a, native, and, the, poetry, of, these, countries, abounds, in, allusions, both, to, the, beauty, and, the, gentleness, of, the, gazelle, other, antelope, that, have, been, tamed, successfully, include, the, gemsbok, the, kudu, and, the, springbok, nor, are, the, characteristics, described, above, necessarily, barriers, to, domestication, for, further, information, see, animal, domestication, a, wide, variety, of, antelope, hybrids, have, been, recorded, in, zoos, game, parks, and, wildlife, ranches, due, to, either, a, lack, of, more, appropriate, mates, in, enclosures, shared, with, other, species, or, a, misidentification, of, species, the, ease, of, hybridization, shows, how, closely, related, some, antelope, species, are, with, few, exceptions, most, hybrid, antelope, occur, only, in, captivity, most, hybrids, occur, between, species, within, the, same, genus, all, reported, examples, occur, within, the, same, subfamily, as, with, most, mammal, hybrids, the, less, closely, related, the, parents, the, more, likely, the, offspring, will, be, sterile, antelope, are, a, common, symbol, in, heraldry, though, they, occur, in, a, highly, distorted, form, from, nature, the, heraldic, antelope, has, the, body, of, a, stag, and, the, tail, of, a, lion, with, serrated, horns, and, a, small, tusk, at, the, end, of, its, snout, this, bizarre, and, inaccurate, form, was, invented, by, european, heralds, in, the, middle, ages, who, knew, little, of, foreign, animals, and, made, up, the, rest, the, antelope, was, mistakenly, imagined, to, be, a, monstrous, beast, of, prey, the, 16th, century, poet, edmund, spenser, referred, to, it, as, being, as, fierce, and, fell, as, a, wolf, antelope, can, all, also, occur, in, their, natural, form, in, which, case, they, are, termed, natural, antelope, to, distinguish, them, from, the, more, usual, heraldic, antelope, the, arms, previously, used, by, the, republic, of, south, africa, featured, a, natural, antelope, along, with, an, oryx
