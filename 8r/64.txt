the, lymphatic, system, or, lymphoid, system, is, an, organ, system, in, vertebrates, that, is, part, of, the, immune, system, and, complementary, to, the, circulatory, system, it, consists, of, a, large, network, of, lymphatic, vessels, lymph, nodes, lymphoid, organs, lymphatic, tissue, and, lymph, lymph, is, a, clear, fluid, carried, by, the, lymphatic, vessels, back, to, the, heart, for, re, circulation, the, latin, word, for, lymph, lympha, refers, to, the, deity, of, fresh, water, lympha, unlike, the, circulatory, system, that, is, a, closed, system, the, lymphatic, system, is, open, the, human, circulatory, system, processes, an, average, of, 20, litres, of, blood, per, day, through, capillary, filtration, which, removes, plasma, from, the, blood, roughly, 17, litres, of, the, filtered, blood, is, reabsorbed, directly, into, the, blood, vessels, while, the, remaining, three, litres, are, left, in, the, interstitial, fluid, one, of, the, main, functions, of, the, lymphatic, system, is, to, provide, an, accessory, return, route, to, the, blood, for, the, surplus, three, litres, the, other, main, function, is, that, of, immune, defense, lymph, is, very, similar, to, blood, plasma, in, that, it, contains, waste, products, and, cellular, debris, together, with, bacteria, and, proteins, the, cells, of, the, lymph, are, mostly, lymphocytes, associated, lymphoid, organs, are, composed, of, lymphoid, tissue, and, are, the, sites, either, of, lymphocyte, production, or, of, lymphocyte, activation, these, include, the, lymph, nodes, where, the, highest, lymphocyte, concentration, is, found, the, spleen, the, thymus, and, the, tonsils, lymphocytes, are, initially, generated, in, the, bone, marrow, the, lymphoid, organs, also, contain, other, types, of, cells, such, as, stromal, cells, for, support, lymphoid, tissue, is, also, associated, with, mucosas, such, as, mucosa, associated, lymphoid, tissue, malt, fluid, from, circulating, blood, leaks, into, the, tissues, of, the, body, by, capillary, action, carrying, nutrients, to, the, cells, the, fluid, bathes, the, tissues, as, interstitial, fluid, collecting, waste, products, bacteria, and, damaged, cells, and, then, drains, as, lymph, into, the, lymphatic, capillaries, and, lymphatic, vessels, these, vessels, carry, the, lymph, throughout, the, body, passing, through, numerous, lymph, nodes, which, filter, out, unwanted, materials, such, as, bacteria, and, damaged, cells, lymph, then, passes, into, much, larger, lymph, vessels, known, as, lymph, ducts, the, right, lymphatic, duct, drains, the, right, side, of, the, region, and, the, much, larger, left, lymphatic, duct, known, as, the, thoracic, duct, drains, the, left, side, of, the, body, the, ducts, empty, into, the, subclavian, veins, to, return, to, the, blood, circulation, lymph, is, moved, through, the, system, by, muscle, contractions, in, some, vertebrates, a, lymph, heart, is, present, that, pumps, the, lymph, to, the, veins, the, lymphatic, system, was, first, described, in, the, 17th, century, independently, by, olaus, rudbeck, and, thomas, bartholin, the, lymphatic, system, consists, of, a, conducting, network, of, lymphatic, vessels, lymphoid, organs, lymphoid, tissues, and, the, circulating, lymph, the, primary, or, central, lymphoid, organs, including, the, thymus, bone, marrow, fetal, liver, and, yolk, sac, are, responsible, for, generating, lymphocytes, from, immature, progenitor, cells, in, the, absence, of, antigens, the, thymus, and, the, bone, marrow, constitute, the, primary, lymphoid, organs, involved, in, the, production, and, early, clonal, selection, of, lymphocyte, tissues, avian, species, s, primary, lymphoid, organs, include, the, bone, marrow, thymus, bursa, of, fabricius, and, yolk, sac, bone, marrow, is, responsible, for, both, the, creation, of, t, cell, precursors, and, the, production, and, maturation, of, b, cells, which, are, important, cell, types, of, the, immune, system, from, the, bone, marrow, b, cells, immediately, join, the, circulatory, system, and, travel, to, secondary, lymphoid, organs, in, search, of, pathogens, t, cells, on, the, other, hand, travel, from, the, bone, marrow, to, the, thymus, where, they, develop, further, and, mature, mature, t, cells, then, join, b, cells, in, search, of, pathogens, the, other, 95, of, t, cells, begin, a, process, of, apoptosis, a, form, of, programmed, cell, death, the, thymus, increases, in, size, from, birth, in, response, to, postnatal, antigen, stimulation, it, is, most, active, during, the, neonatal, and, pre, adolescent, periods, the, thymus, is, located, between, the, inferior, neck, and, the, superior, thorax, at, puberty, by, the, early, teens, the, thymus, begins, to, atrophy, and, regress, with, adipose, tissue, mostly, replacing, the, thymic, stroma, however, residual, t, cell, lymphopoiesis, continues, throughout, adult, life, providing, some, immune, response, the, thymus, is, where, the, t, lymphocytes, mature, and, become, immunocompetent, the, loss, or, lack, of, the, thymus, results, in, severe, immunodeficiency, and, subsequent, high, susceptibility, to, infection, in, most, species, the, thymus, consists, of, lobules, divided, by, septa, which, are, made, up, of, epithelium, which, is, often, considered, an, epithelial, organ, t, cells, mature, from, thymocytes, proliferate, and, undergo, a, selection, process, in, the, thymic, cortex, before, entering, the, medulla, to, interact, with, epithelial, cells, research, on, bony, fish, showed, a, buildup, of, t, cells, in, the, thymus, and, spleen, of, lymphoid, tissues, in, salmon, and, showed, that, there, are, not, many, t, cells, in, non, lymphoid, tissues, the, thymus, provides, an, inductive, environment, for, the, development, of, t, cells, from, hematopoietic, progenitor, cells, in, addition, thymic, stromal, cells, allow, for, the, selection, of, a, functional, and, self, tolerant, t, cell, repertoire, therefore, one, of, the, most, important, roles, of, the, thymus, is, the, induction, of, central, tolerance, however, the, thymus, is, not, where, the, infection, is, fought, as, the, t, cells, have, yet, to, become, immunocompetent, the, secondary, or, peripheral, lymphoid, organs, which, include, lymph, nodes, and, the, spleen, maintain, mature, naive, lymphocytes, and, initiate, an, adaptive, immune, response, the, secondary, lymphoid, organs, are, the, sites, of, lymphocyte, activation, by, antigens, activation, leads, to, clonal, expansion, and, affinity, maturation, mature, lymphocytes, recirculate, between, the, blood, and, the, secondary, lymphoid, organs, until, they, encounter, their, specific, antigen, the, main, functions, of, the, spleen, are, the, spleen, synthesizes, antibodies, in, its, white, pulp, and, removes, antibody, coated, bacteria, and, antibody, coated, blood, cells, by, way, of, blood, and, lymph, node, circulation, the, white, pulp, of, the, spleen, provides, immune, function, due, to, the, lymphocytes, that, are, housed, there, the, spleen, also, consists, of, red, pulp, which, is, responsible, for, getting, rid, of, aged, red, blood, cells, as, well, as, pathogens, this, is, carried, out, by, macrophages, present, in, the, red, pulp, a, study, published, in, 2009, using, mice, found, that, the, spleen, contains, in, its, reserve, half, of, the, body, s, monocytes, within, the, red, pulp, these, monocytes, upon, moving, to, injured, tissue, such, as, the, heart, turn, into, dendritic, cells, and, macrophages, while, promoting, tissue, healing, the, spleen, is, a, center, of, activity, of, the, mononuclear, phagocyte, system, and, can, be, considered, analogous, to, a, large, lymph, node, as, its, absence, causes, a, predisposition, to, certain, infections, notably, the, spleen, is, important, for, a, multitude, of, functions, the, spleen, removes, pathogens, and, old, erythrocytes, from, the, blood, red, pulp, and, produces, lymphocytes, for, immune, response, white, pulp, the, spleen, also, is, responsible, for, recycling, some, erythrocytes, components, and, discarding, others, for, example, hemoglobin, is, broken, down, into, amino, acids, that, are, reused, research, on, bony, fish, has, shown, that, a, high, concentration, of, t, cells, are, found, in, the, white, pulp, of, the, spleen, like, the, thymus, the, spleen, has, only, efferent, lymphatic, vessels, both, the, short, gastric, arteries, and, the, splenic, artery, supply, it, with, blood, the, germinal, centers, are, supplied, by, arterioles, called, penicilliary, radicles, in, the, human, until, the, fifth, month, of, prenatal, development, the, spleen, creates, red, blood, cells, after, birth, the, bone, marrow, is, solely, responsible, for, hematopoiesis, as, a, major, lymphoid, organ, and, a, central, player, in, the, reticuloendothelial, system, the, spleen, retains, the, ability, to, produce, lymphocytes, the, spleen, stores, red, blood, cells, and, lymphocytes, it, can, store, enough, blood, cells, to, help, in, an, emergency, up, to, 25, of, lymphocytes, can, be, stored, at, any, one, time, a, lymph, node, is, an, organized, collection, of, lymphoid, tissue, through, which, the, lymph, passes, on, its, way, back, to, the, blood, lymph, nodes, are, located, at, intervals, along, the, lymphatic, system, several, afferent, lymph, vessels, bring, in, lymph, which, percolates, through, the, substance, of, the, lymph, node, and, is, then, drained, out, by, an, efferent, lymph, vessel, of, the, nearly, 800, lymph, nodes, in, the, human, body, about, 300, are, located, in, the, head, and, neck, many, are, grouped, in, clusters, in, different, regions, as, in, the, underarm, and, abdominal, areas, lymph, node, clusters, are, commonly, found, at, the, proximal, ends, of, limbs, groin, armpits, and, in, the, neck, where, lymph, is, collected, from, regions, of, the, body, likely, to, sustain, pathogen, contamination, from, injuries, lymph, nodes, are, particularly, numerous, in, the, mediastinum, in, the, chest, neck, pelvis, axilla, inguinal, region, and, in, association, with, the, blood, vessels, of, the, intestines, the, substance, of, a, lymph, node, consists, of, lymphoid, follicles, in, an, outer, portion, called, the, cortex, the, inner, portion, of, the, node, is, called, the, medulla, which, is, surrounded, by, the, cortex, on, all, sides, except, for, a, portion, known, as, the, hilum, the, hilum, presents, as, a, depression, on, the, surface, of, the, lymph, node, causing, the, otherwise, spherical, lymph, node, to, be, bean, shaped, or, ovoid, the, efferent, lymph, vessel, directly, emerges, from, the, lymph, node, at, the, hilum, the, arteries, and, veins, supplying, the, lymph, node, with, blood, enter, and, exit, through, the, hilum, the, region, of, the, lymph, node, called, the, paracortex, immediately, surrounds, the, medulla, unlike, the, cortex, which, has, mostly, immature, t, cells, or, thymocytes, the, paracortex, has, a, mixture, of, immature, and, mature, t, cells, lymphocytes, enter, the, lymph, nodes, through, specialised, high, endothelial, venules, found, in, the, paracortex, a, lymph, follicle, is, a, dense, collection, of, lymphocytes, the, number, size, and, configuration, of, which, change, in, accordance, with, the, functional, state, of, the, lymph, node, for, example, the, follicles, expand, significantly, when, encountering, a, foreign, antigen, the, selection, of, b, cells, or, b, lymphocytes, occurs, in, the, germinal, centre, of, the, lymph, nodes, secondary, lymphoid, tissue, provides, the, environment, for, the, foreign, or, altered, native, molecules, antigens, to, interact, with, the, lymphocytes, it, is, exemplified, by, the, lymph, nodes, and, the, lymphoid, follicles, in, tonsils, peyer, s, patches, spleen, adenoids, skin, etc, that, are, associated, with, the, mucosa, associated, lymphoid, tissue, malt, in, the, gastrointestinal, wall, the, appendix, has, mucosa, resembling, that, of, the, colon, but, here, it, is, heavily, infiltrated, with, lymphocytes, tertiary, lymphoid, organs, tlos, are, abnormal, lymph, node, like, structures, that, form, in, peripheral, tissues, at, sites, of, chronic, inflammation, such, as, chronic, infection, transplanted, organs, undergoing, graft, rejection, some, cancers, and, autoimmune, and, autoimmune, related, diseases, tlos, are, regulated, differently, from, the, normal, process, whereby, lymphoid, tissues, are, formed, during, ontogeny, being, dependent, on, cytokines, and, hematopoietic, cells, but, still, drain, interstitial, fluid, and, transport, lymphocytes, in, response, to, the, same, chemical, messengers, and, gradients, tlos, typically, contain, far, fewer, lymphocytes, and, assume, an, immune, role, only, when, challenged, with, antigens, that, result, in, inflammation, they, achieve, this, by, importing, the, lymphocytes, from, blood, and, lymph, tlos, often, have, an, active, germinal, center, surrounded, by, a, network, of, follicular, dendritic, cells, fdcs, tlos, are, thought, to, play, an, important, role, in, the, immune, response, to, cancer, and, to, have, possible, implications, in, immunotherapy, they, have, been, observed, in, a, number, of, cancer, types, such, as, melanoma, non, small, cell, lung, cancer, and, colorectal, cancer, reviewed, in, as, well, as, glioma, patients, with, tlos, in, the, vicinity, of, their, tumors, tend, to, have, a, better, prognosis, although, the, opposite, is, true, for, certain, cancers, tlos, that, contain, an, active, germinal, center, tend, to, have, a, better, prognosis, than, those, with, tlos, without, a, germinal, center, the, reason, that, these, patients, tend, to, live, longer, is, thought, to, be, the, immune, response, against, the, tumor, which, is, mediated, by, the, tlos, tlos, may, also, promote, an, anti, tumor, response, when, patients, are, treated, with, immunotherapy, tlos, have, been, referred, to, in, many, different, ways, including, as, tertiary, lymphoid, structures, tls, and, ectopic, lymphoid, structures, els, when, associated, with, colorectal, cancer, they, are, often, referred, to, as, a, crohn, s, like, lymphoid, reaction, lymphoid, tissue, associated, with, the, lymphatic, system, is, concerned, with, immune, functions, in, defending, the, body, against, infections, and, the, spread, of, tumours, it, consists, of, connective, tissue, formed, of, reticular, fibers, with, various, types, of, leukocytes, white, blood, cells, mostly, lymphocytes, enmeshed, in, it, through, which, the, lymph, passes, regions, of, the, lymphoid, tissue, that, are, densely, packed, with, lymphocytes, are, known, as, lymphoid, follicles, lymphoid, tissue, can, either, be, structurally, well, organized, as, lymph, nodes, or, may, consist, of, loosely, organized, lymphoid, follicles, known, as, the, mucosa, associated, lymphoid, tissue, malt, the, central, nervous, system, also, has, lymphatic, vessels, the, search, for, t, cell, gateways, into, and, out, of, the, meninges, uncovered, functional, meningeal, lymphatic, vessels, lining, the, dural, sinuses, anatomically, integrated, into, the, membrane, surrounding, the, brain, the, lymphatic, vessels, also, called, lymph, vessels, are, thin, walled, vessels, that, conduct, lymph, between, different, parts, of, the, body, they, include, the, tubular, vessels, of, the, lymph, capillaries, and, the, larger, collecting, vessels, the, right, lymphatic, duct, and, the, thoracic, duct, the, left, lymphatic, duct, the, lymph, capillaries, are, mainly, responsible, for, the, absorption, of, interstitial, fluid, from, the, tissues, while, lymph, vessels, propel, the, absorbed, fluid, forward, into, the, larger, collecting, ducts, where, it, ultimately, returns, to, the, bloodstream, via, one, of, the, subclavian, veins, the, tissues, of, the, lymphatic, system, are, responsible, for, maintaining, the, balance, of, the, body, fluids, its, network, of, capillaries, and, collecting, lymphatic, vessels, work, to, efficiently, drain, and, transport, extravasated, fluid, along, with, proteins, and, antigens, back, to, the, circulatory, system, numerous, intraluminal, valves, in, the, vessels, ensure, a, unidirectional, flow, of, lymph, without, reflux, two, valve, systems, a, primary, and, a, secondary, valve, system, are, used, to, achieve, this, unidirectional, flow, the, capillaries, are, blind, ended, and, the, valves, at, the, ends, of, capillaries, use, specialised, junctions, together, with, anchoring, filaments, to, allow, a, unidirectional, flow, to, the, primary, vessels, when, interstitial, fluid, increases, it, causes, swelling, that, stretches, collagen, fibers, anchored, to, adjacent, connective, tissue, in, turn, opening, the, unidirectional, valves, at, the, ends, of, these, capillaries, facilitating, the, entry, and, subsequent, drainage, of, excess, lymph, fluid, the, collecting, lymphatics, however, act, to, propel, the, lymph, by, the, combined, actions, of, the, intraluminal, valves, and, lymphatic, muscle, cells, lymphatic, tissues, begin, to, develop, by, the, end, of, the, fifth, week, of, embryonic, development, lymphatic, vessels, develop, from, lymph, sacs, that, arise, from, developing, veins, which, are, derived, from, mesoderm, the, first, lymph, sacs, to, appear, are, the, paired, jugular, lymph, sacs, at, the, junction, of, the, internal, jugular, and, subclavian, veins, from, the, jugular, lymph, sacs, lymphatic, capillary, plexuses, spread, to, the, thorax, upper, limbs, neck, and, head, some, of, the, plexuses, enlarge, and, form, lymphatic, vessels, in, their, respective, regions, each, jugular, lymph, sac, retains, at, least, one, connection, with, its, jugular, vein, the, left, one, developing, into, the, superior, portion, of, the, thoracic, duct, the, spleen, develops, from, mesenchymal, cells, between, layers, of, the, dorsal, mesentery, of, the, stomach, the, thymus, arises, as, an, outgrowth, of, the, third, pharyngeal, pouch, the, lymphatic, system, has, multiple, interrelated, functions, lymph, vessels, called, lacteals, are, at, the, beginning, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, predominantly, in, the, small, intestine, while, most, other, nutrients, absorbed, by, the, small, intestine, are, passed, on, to, the, portal, venous, system, to, drain, via, the, portal, vein, into, the, liver, for, processing, fats, lipids, are, passed, on, to, the, lymphatic, system, to, be, transported, to, the, blood, circulation, via, the, thoracic, duct, there, are, exceptions, for, example, medium, chain, triglycerides, are, fatty, acid, esters, of, glycerol, that, passively, diffuse, from, the, gi, tract, to, the, portal, system, the, enriched, lymph, originating, in, the, lymphatics, of, the, small, intestine, is, called, chyle, the, nutrients, that, are, released, into, the, circulatory, system, are, processed, by, the, liver, having, passed, through, the, systemic, circulation, the, lymphatic, system, plays, a, major, role, in, the, body, s, immune, system, as, the, primary, site, for, cells, relating, to, adaptive, immune, system, including, t, cells, and, b, cells, cells, in, the, lymphatic, system, react, to, antigens, presented, or, found, by, the, cells, directly, or, by, other, dendritic, cells, when, an, antigen, is, recognized, an, immunological, cascade, begins, involving, the, activation, and, recruitment, of, more, and, more, cells, the, production, of, antibodies, and, cytokines, and, the, recruitment, of, other, immunological, cells, such, as, macrophages, the, study, of, lymphatic, drainage, of, various, organs, is, important, in, the, diagnosis, prognosis, and, treatment, of, cancer, the, lymphatic, system, because, of, its, closeness, to, many, tissues, of, the, body, is, responsible, for, carrying, cancerous, cells, between, the, various, parts, of, the, body, in, a, process, called, metastasis, the, intervening, lymph, nodes, can, trap, the, cancer, cells, if, they, are, not, successful, in, destroying, the, cancer, cells, the, nodes, may, become, sites, of, secondary, tumours, lymphadenopathy, refers, to, one, or, more, enlarged, lymph, nodes, small, groups, or, individually, enlarged, lymph, nodes, are, generally, reactive, in, response, to, infection, or, inflammation, this, is, called, local, lymphadenopathy, when, many, lymph, nodes, in, different, areas, of, the, body, are, involved, this, is, called, generalised, lymphadenopathy, generalised, lymphadenopathy, may, be, caused, by, infections, such, as, infectious, mononucleosis, tuberculosis, and, hiv, connective, tissue, diseases, such, as, sle, and, rheumatoid, arthritis, and, cancers, including, both, cancers, of, tissue, within, lymph, nodes, discussed, below, and, metastasis, of, cancerous, cells, from, other, parts, of, the, body, that, have, arrived, via, the, lymphatic, system, lymphedema, is, the, swelling, caused, by, the, accumulation, of, lymph, which, may, occur, if, the, lymphatic, system, is, damaged, or, has, malformations, it, usually, affects, limbs, though, the, face, neck, and, abdomen, may, also, be, affected, in, an, extreme, state, called, elephantiasis, the, edema, progresses, to, the, extent, that, the, skin, becomes, thick, with, an, appearance, similar, to, the, skin, on, elephant, limbs, causes, are, unknown, in, most, cases, but, sometimes, there, is, a, previous, history, of, severe, infection, usually, caused, by, a, parasitic, disease, such, as, lymphatic, filariasis, lymphangiomatosis, is, a, disease, involving, multiple, cysts, or, lesions, formed, from, lymphatic, vessels, lymphedema, can, also, occur, after, surgical, removal, of, lymph, nodes, in, the, armpit, causing, the, arm, to, swell, due, to, poor, lymphatic, drainage, or, groin, causing, swelling, of, the, leg, conventional, treatment, is, by, manual, lymphatic, drainage, and, compression, garments, two, drugs, for, the, treatment, of, lymphedema, are, in, clinical, trials, lymfactin, and, ubenimex, bestatin, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, the, effects, of, manual, lymphatic, drainage, are, permanent, cancer, of, the, lymphatic, system, can, be, primary, or, secondary, lymphoma, refers, to, cancer, that, arises, from, lymphatic, tissue, lymphoid, leukaemias, and, lymphomas, are, now, considered, to, be, tumours, of, the, same, type, of, cell, lineage, they, are, called, leukaemia, when, in, the, blood, or, marrow, and, lymphoma, when, in, lymphatic, tissue, they, are, grouped, together, under, the, name, lymphoid, malignancy, lymphoma, is, generally, considered, as, either, hodgkin, lymphoma, or, non, hodgkin, lymphoma, hodgkin, lymphoma, is, characterised, by, a, particular, type, of, cell, called, a, reed, sternberg, cell, visible, under, microscope, it, is, associated, with, past, infection, with, the, epstein, barr, virus, and, generally, causes, a, painless, rubbery, lymphadenopathy, it, is, staged, using, ann, arbor, staging, chemotherapy, generally, involves, the, abvd, and, may, also, involve, radiotherapy, non, hodgkin, lymphoma, is, a, cancer, characterised, by, increased, proliferation, of, b, cells, or, t, cells, generally, occurs, in, an, older, age, group, than, hodgkin, lymphoma, it, is, treated, according, to, whether, it, is, high, grade, or, low, grade, and, carries, a, poorer, prognosis, than, hodgkin, lymphoma, lymphangiosarcoma, is, a, malignant, soft, tissue, tumour, whereas, lymphangioma, is, a, benign, tumour, occurring, frequently, in, association, with, turner, syndrome, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, is, a, benign, tumour, of, the, smooth, muscles, of, the, lymphatics, that, occurs, in, the, lungs, lymphoid, leukaemia, is, another, form, of, cancer, where, the, host, is, devoid, of, different, lymphatic, cells, hippocrates, in, the, 5th, century, bc, was, one, of, the, first, people, to, mention, the, lymphatic, system, in, his, work, on, joints, he, briefly, mentioned, the, lymph, nodes, in, one, sentence, rufus, of, ephesus, a, roman, physician, identified, the, axillary, inguinal, and, mesenteric, lymph, nodes, as, well, as, the, thymus, during, the, 1st, to, 2nd, century, ad, the, first, mention, of, lymphatic, vessels, was, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, by, herophilos, a, greek, anatomist, living, in, alexandria, who, incorrectly, concluded, that, the, absorptive, veins, of, the, lymphatics, by, which, he, meant, the, lacteals, lymph, vessels, of, the, intestines, drained, into, the, hepatic, portal, veins, and, thus, into, the, liver, the, findings, of, ruphus, and, herophilos, were, further, propagated, by, the, greek, physician, galen, who, described, the, lacteals, and, mesenteric, lymph, nodes, which, he, observed, in, his, dissection, of, apes, and, pigs, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, in, the, mid, 16th, century, gabriele, falloppio, discoverer, of, the, fallopian, tubes, described, what, is, now, known, as, the, lacteals, as, coursing, over, the, intestines, full, of, yellow, matter, in, about, 1563, bartolomeo, eustachi, a, professor, of, anatomy, described, the, thoracic, duct, in, horses, as, vena, alba, thoracis, the, next, breakthrough, came, when, in, 1622, a, physician, gaspare, aselli, identified, lymphatic, vessels, of, the, intestines, in, dogs, and, termed, them, venae, albae, et, lacteae, which, are, now, known, as, simply, the, lacteals, the, lacteals, were, termed, the, fourth, kind, of, vessels, the, other, three, being, the, artery, vein, and, nerve, which, was, then, believed, to, be, a, type, of, vessel, and, disproved, galen, s, assertion, that, chyle, was, carried, by, the, veins, but, he, still, believed, that, the, lacteals, carried, the, chyle, to, the, liver, as, taught, by, galen, he, also, identified, the, thoracic, duct, but, failed, to, notice, its, connection, with, the, lacteals, this, connection, was, established, by, jean, pecquet, in, 1651, who, found, a, white, fluid, mixing, with, blood, in, a, dog, s, heart, he, suspected, that, fluid, to, be, chyle, as, its, flow, increased, when, abdominal, pressure, was, applied, he, traced, this, fluid, to, the, thoracic, duct, which, he, then, followed, to, a, chyle, filled, sac, he, called, the, chyli, receptaculum, which, is, now, known, as, the, cisternae, chyli, further, investigations, led, him, to, find, that, lacteals, contents, enter, the, venous, system, via, the, thoracic, duct, thus, it, was, proven, convincingly, that, the, lacteals, did, not, terminate, in, the, liver, thus, disproving, galen, s, second, idea, that, the, chyle, flowed, to, the, liver, johann, veslingius, drew, the, earliest, sketches, of, the, lacteals, in, humans, in, 1641, the, idea, that, blood, recirculates, through, the, body, rather, than, being, produced, anew, by, the, liver, and, the, heart, was, first, accepted, as, a, result, of, works, of, william, harvey, a, work, he, published, in, 1628, in, 1652, olaus, rudbeck, 1630, 1702, discovered, certain, transparent, vessels, in, the, liver, that, contained, clear, fluid, and, not, white, and, thus, named, them, hepatico, aqueous, vessels, he, also, learned, that, they, emptied, into, the, thoracic, duct, and, that, they, had, valves, he, announced, his, findings, in, the, court, of, queen, christina, of, sweden, but, did, not, publish, his, findings, for, a, year, and, in, the, interim, similar, findings, were, published, by, thomas, bartholin, who, additionally, published, that, such, vessels, are, present, everywhere, in, the, body, not, just, in, the, liver, he, is, also, the, one, to, have, named, them, lymphatic, vessels, this, had, resulted, in, a, bitter, dispute, between, one, of, bartholin, s, pupils, martin, bogdan, and, rudbeck, whom, he, accused, of, plagiarism, galen, s, ideas, prevailed, in, medicine, until, the, 17th, century, it, was, thought, that, blood, was, produced, by, the, liver, from, chyle, contaminated, with, ailments, by, the, intestine, and, stomach, to, which, various, spirits, were, added, by, other, organs, and, that, this, blood, was, consumed, by, all, the, organs, of, the, body, this, theory, required, that, the, blood, be, consumed, and, produced, many, times, over, even, in, the, 17th, century, his, ideas, were, defended, by, some, physicians, alexander, monro, of, the, university, of, edinburgh, medical, school, was, the, first, to, describe, the, function, of, the, lymphatic, system, in, detail, uva, school, of, medicine, researchers, jonathan, kipnis, and, antoine, louveau, discovered, previously, unknown, vessels, connecting, the, human, brain, directly, to, the, lymphatic, system, the, discovery, redrew, the, map, of, the, lymphatic, system, rewrote, medical, textbooks, and, struck, down, long, held, beliefs, about, how, the, immune, system, functions, in, the, brain, the, discovery, may, help, greatly, in, combating, neurological, diseases, from, multiple, sclerosis, to, alzheimer, s, disease, lymph, originates, in, the, classical, latin, word, lympha, water, which, is, also, the, source, of, the, english, word, limpid, the, spelling, with, y, and, ph, was, influenced, by, folk, etymology, with, greek, n, mph, nymph, the, adjective, used, for, the, lymph, transporting, system, is, lymphatic, the, adjective, used, for, the, tissues, where, lymphocytes, are, formed, is, lymphoid, lymphatic, comes, from, the, latin, word, lymphaticus,
