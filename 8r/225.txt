birth, is, the, act, or, process, of, bearing, or, bringing, forth, offspring, also, referred, to, in, technical, contexts, as, parturition, in, mammals, the, process, is, initiated, by, hormones, which, cause, the, muscular, walls, of, the, uterus, to, contract, expelling, the, fetus, at, a, developmental, stage, when, it, is, ready, to, feed, and, breathe, in, some, species, the, offspring, is, precocial, and, can, move, around, almost, immediately, after, birth, but, in, others, it, is, altricial, and, completely, dependent, on, parenting, in, marsupials, the, fetus, is, born, at, a, very, immature, stage, after, a, short, gestation, and, develops, further, in, its, mother, s, womb, pouch, it, is, not, only, mammals, that, give, birth, some, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and, invertebrates, carry, their, developing, young, inside, them, some, of, these, are, ovoviviparous, with, the, eggs, being, hatched, inside, the, mother, s, body, and, others, are, viviparous, with, the, embryo, developing, inside, their, body, as, in, the, case, of, mammals, humans, usually, produce, a, single, offspring, at, a, time, the, mother, s, body, is, prepared, for, birth, by, hormones, produced, by, the, pituitary, gland, the, ovary, and, the, placenta, the, total, gestation, period, from, fertilization, to, birth, is, normally, about, 38, weeks, birth, usually, occurring, 40, weeks, after, the, last, menstrual, period, the, normal, process, of, childbirth, takes, several, hours, and, has, three, stages, the, first, stage, starts, with, a, series, of, involuntary, contractions, of, the, muscular, walls, of, the, uterus, and, gradual, dilation, of, the, cervix, the, active, phase, of, the, first, stage, starts, when, the, cervix, is, dilated, more, than, about, 4, cm, in, diameter, and, is, when, the, contractions, become, stronger, and, regular, the, head, or, the, buttocks, in, a, breech, birth, of, the, baby, is, pushed, against, the, cervix, which, gradually, dilates, until, it, is, fully, dilated, at, 10, cm, diameter, at, some, time, the, amniotic, sac, bursts, and, the, amniotic, fluid, escapes, also, known, as, rupture, of, membranes, or, breaking, the, water, in, stage, two, starting, when, the, cervix, is, fully, dilated, strong, contractions, of, the, uterus, and, active, pushing, by, the, mother, expels, the, baby, out, through, the, vagina, which, during, this, stage, of, labour, is, called, a, birth, canal, as, this, passage, contains, a, baby, and, the, baby, is, born, with, umbilical, cord, attached, in, stage, three, which, begins, after, the, birth, of, the, baby, further, contractions, expel, the, placenta, amniotic, sac, and, the, remaining, portion, of, the, umbilical, cord, usually, within, a, few, minutes, enormous, changes, take, place, in, the, newborn, s, circulation, to, enable, breathing, in, air, in, the, uterus, the, fetus, is, dependent, on, circulation, of, blood, through, the, placenta, for, sustenance, including, gaseous, exchange, and, the, unborn, baby, s, blood, bypasses, the, lungs, by, flowing, through, the, foramen, ovale, which, is, a, hole, in, the, septum, dividing, the, right, atrium, and, left, atrium, after, birth, the, umbilical, cord, is, clamped, and, cut, the, baby, starts, to, breathe, air, and, blood, from, the, right, ventricle, starts, to, flow, to, the, lungs, for, gaseous, exchange, and, oxygenated, blood, returns, to, the, left, atrium, which, is, pumped, into, the, left, ventricle, and, then, pumped, into, the, main, arterial, system, as, a, result, of, these, changes, the, blood, pressure, in, the, left, atrium, exceeds, the, pressure, in, the, right, atrium, and, this, pressure, difference, forces, the, foramen, ovale, to, close, separating, the, left, and, right, sides, of, the, heart, the, umbilical, vein, umbilical, arteries, ductus, venosus, and, ductus, arteriosus, are, not, needed, for, life, in, air, and, in, time, these, vessels, become, ligaments, embryonic, remnants, large, mammals, such, as, primates, cattle, horses, some, antelopes, giraffes, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, elephants, seals, whales, dolphins, and, porpoises, generally, are, pregnant, with, one, offspring, at, a, time, although, they, may, have, twin, or, multiple, births, on, occasion, in, these, large, animals, the, birth, process, is, similar, to, that, of, a, human, though, in, most, the, offspring, is, precocial, this, means, that, it, is, born, in, a, more, advanced, state, than, a, human, baby, and, is, able, to, stand, walk, and, run, or, swim, in, the, case, of, an, aquatic, mammal, shortly, after, birth, in, the, case, of, whales, dolphins, and, porpoises, the, single, calf, is, normally, born, tail, first, which, minimizes, the, risk, of, drowning, the, mother, encourages, the, newborn, calf, to, rise, to, the, surface, of, the, water, to, breathe, large, mammals, which, give, birth, to, twins, is, much, more, rare, but, it, does, occur, occasionally, even, for, mammals, as, large, as, elephants, in, april, 2018, approximately, 8, month, old, elephant, twins, were, sighted, joining, their, mother, s, herd, in, the, tarangire, national, park, of, tanzania, estimated, to, have, been, born, in, august, 2017, birthing, in, cattle, is, typical, of, a, larger, mammal, a, cow, goes, through, three, stages, of, labor, during, normal, delivery, of, a, calf, during, stage, one, the, animal, seeks, a, quiet, place, away, from, the, rest, of, the, herd, hormone, changes, cause, soft, tissues, of, the, birth, canal, to, relax, as, the, mother, s, body, prepares, for, birth, the, contractions, of, the, uterus, are, not, obvious, externally, but, the, cow, may, be, restless, she, may, appear, agitated, alternating, between, standing, and, lying, down, with, her, tail, slightly, raised, and, her, back, arched, the, fetus, is, pushed, toward, the, birth, canal, by, each, contraction, and, the, cow, s, cervix, gradually, begins, to, dilate, stage, one, may, last, several, hours, and, ends, when, the, cervix, is, fully, dilated, stage, two, can, be, seen, to, be, underway, when, there, is, external, protrusion, of, the, amniotic, sac, through, the, vulva, closely, followed, by, the, appearance, of, the, calf, s, front, hooves, and, head, in, a, front, presentation, or, occasionally, the, calf, s, tail, and, rear, end, in, a, posterior, presentation, during, the, second, stage, the, cow, will, usually, lie, down, on, her, side, to, push, and, the, calf, progresses, through, the, birth, canal, the, complete, delivery, of, the, calf, or, calves, in, a, multiple, birth, signifies, the, end, of, stage, two, the, cow, scrambles, to, her, feet, if, lying, down, at, this, stage, turns, round, and, starts, vigorously, licking, the, calf, the, calf, takes, its, first, few, breaths, and, within, minutes, is, struggling, to, rise, to, its, feet, the, third, and, final, stage, of, labor, is, the, delivery, of, the, placenta, which, is, usually, expelled, within, a, few, hours, and, is, often, eaten, by, the, normally, herbivorous, cow, birth, is, termed, whelping, in, dogs, among, dogs, as, whelping, approaches, contractions, become, more, frequent, labour, in, the, bitch, can, be, divided, into, 3, stages, the, first, stage, is, when, the, cervix, dilates, causing, discomfort, and, restlessness, in, the, dog, common, signs, of, this, stage, are, panting, fasting, and, or, vomiting, this, may, last, up, to, 12, hours, stage, two, is, the, passage, of, the, offspring, the, amniotic, sac, looking, like, a, glistening, grey, balloon, with, a, puppy, inside, is, propelled, through, the, vulva, after, further, contractions, the, sac, is, expelled, and, the, bitch, breaks, the, membranes, releasing, clear, fluid, and, exposing, the, puppy, the, mother, chews, at, the, umbilical, cord, and, licks, the, puppy, vigorously, which, stimulates, it, to, breathe, if, the, puppy, has, not, taken, its, first, breath, within, about, six, minutes, it, is, likely, to, die, further, puppies, follow, in, a, similar, way, one, by, one, usually, with, less, straining, than, the, first, usually, at, 15, 60, minute, intervals, if, a, pup, has, not, been, passed, in, 2, hours, a, veterinarian, should, be, contacted, stage, three, is, the, passing, of, the, placentas, this, often, occurs, in, conjunction, with, stage, two, with, the, passing, of, each, offspring, the, mother, will, then, usually, eat, the, afterbirth, this, is, an, adaption, to, keep, the, den, clean, and, prevent, its, detection, by, predators, an, infant, marsupial, is, born, in, a, very, immature, state, the, gestation, period, is, usually, shorter, than, the, intervals, between, oestrus, periods, the, first, sign, that, a, birth, is, imminent, is, the, mother, cleaning, out, her, pouch, when, it, is, born, the, infant, is, pink, blind, furless, and, a, few, centimetres, long, it, has, nostrils, in, order, to, breathe, and, forelegs, to, cling, onto, its, mother, s, hairs, but, its, hind, legs, are, undeveloped, it, crawls, through, its, mother, s, fur, and, makes, its, way, into, the, pouch, here, it, fixes, onto, a, teat, which, swells, inside, its, mouth, it, stays, attached, to, the, teat, for, several, months, until, it, is, sufficiently, developed, to, emerge, joeys, are, born, with, oral, shields, in, species, without, pouches, or, with, rudimentary, pouches, these, are, more, developed, than, in, forms, with, well, developed, pouches, implying, a, role, in, maintaining, the, young, attached, to, the, mother, s, nipple, many, reptiles, and, the, vast, majority, of, invertebrates, most, fish, amphibians, and, all, birds, are, oviparous, that, is, they, lay, eggs, with, little, or, no, embryonic, development, taking, place, within, the, mother, in, aquatic, organisms, fertilization, is, nearly, always, external, with, sperm, and, eggs, being, liberated, into, the, water, an, exception, is, sharks, and, rays, which, have, internal, fertilization, millions, of, eggs, may, be, produced, with, no, further, parental, involvement, in, the, expectation, that, a, small, number, may, survive, to, become, mature, individuals, terrestrial, invertebrates, may, also, produce, large, numbers, of, eggs, a, few, of, which, may, avoid, predation, and, carry, on, the, species, some, fish, reptiles, and, amphibians, have, adopted, a, different, strategy, and, invest, their, effort, in, producing, a, small, number, of, young, at, a, more, advanced, stage, which, are, more, likely, to, survive, to, adulthood, birds, care, for, their, young, in, the, nest, and, provide, for, their, needs, after, hatching, and, it, is, perhaps, unsurprising, that, internal, development, does, not, occur, in, birds, given, their, need, to, fly, ovoviviparity, is, a, mode, of, reproduction, in, which, embryos, develop, inside, eggs, that, remain, in, the, mother, s, body, until, they, are, ready, to, hatch, ovoviviparous, animals, are, similar, to, viviparous, species, in, that, there, is, internal, fertilization, and, the, young, are, born, in, an, advanced, state, but, differ, in, that, there, is, no, placental, connection, and, the, unborn, young, are, nourished, by, egg, yolk, the, mother, s, body, provides, gas, exchange, respiration, but, that, is, largely, necessary, for, oviparous, animals, as, well, in, many, sharks, the, eggs, hatch, in, the, oviduct, within, the, mother, s, body, and, the, embryos, are, nourished, by, the, egg, s, yolk, and, fluids, secreted, by, glands, in, the, walls, of, the, oviduct, the, lamniforme, sharks, practice, oophagy, where, the, first, embryos, to, hatch, consume, the, remaining, eggs, and, sand, tiger, shark, pups, cannibalistically, consume, neighbouring, embryos, the, requiem, sharks, maintain, a, placental, link, to, the, developing, young, this, practice, is, known, as, viviparity, this, is, more, analogous, to, mammalian, gestation, than, to, that, of, other, fishes, in, all, these, cases, the, young, are, born, alive, and, fully, functional, the, majority, of, caecilians, are, ovoviviparous, and, give, birth, to, already, developed, offspring, when, the, young, have, finished, their, yolk, sacs, they, feed, on, nutrients, secreted, by, cells, lining, the, oviduct, and, even, the, cells, themselves, which, they, eat, with, specialist, scraping, teeth, the, alpine, salamander, salamandra, atra, and, several, species, of, tanzanian, toad, in, the, genus, nectophrynoides, are, ovoviviparous, developing, through, the, larval, stage, inside, the, mother, s, oviduct, and, eventually, emerging, as, fully, formed, juveniles, a, more, developed, form, of, viviparity, called, placental, viviparity, is, adopted, by, some, species, of, scorpions, and, cockroaches, certain, genera, of, sharks, snakes, and, velvet, worms, in, these, the, developing, embryo, is, nourished, by, some, form, of, placental, structure, the, earliest, known, placenta, was, found, recently, in, a, group, of, extinct, fishes, called, placoderms, a, fossil, from, australia, s, gogo, formation, laid, down, in, the, devonian, period, 380, million, years, ago, was, found, with, an, embryo, inside, it, connected, by, an, umbilical, cord, to, a, yolk, sac, the, find, confirmed, the, hypothesis, that, a, sub, group, of, placoderms, called, ptyctodontids, fertilized, their, eggs, internally, some, fishes, that, fertilize, their, eggs, internally, also, give, birth, to, live, young, as, seen, here, this, discovery, moved, our, knowledge, of, live, birth, back, 200, million, years, the, fossil, of, another, genus, was, found, with, three, embryos, in, the, same, position, placoderms, are, a, sister, group, of, the, ancestor, of, all, living, jawed, fishes, gnathostomata, including, both, chondrichthyans, the, sharks, rays, and, osteichthyes, the, bony, fishes, among, lizards, the, viviparous, lizard, zootoca, vivipara, the, jackson, s, chameleon, slow, worms, and, many, species, of, skink, are, viviparous, giving, birth, to, live, young, some, are, ovoviviparous, but, others, such, as, members, of, the, genera, tiliqua, and, corucia, give, birth, to, live, young, that, develop, internally, deriving, their, nourishment, from, a, mammal, like, placenta, attached, to, the, inside, of, the, mother, s, uterus, in, a, recently, described, example, an, african, species, trachylepis, ivensi, has, developed, a, purely, reptilian, placenta, directly, comparable, in, structure, and, function, to, a, mammalian, placenta, vivipary, is, rare, in, snakes, but, boas, and, vipers, are, viviparous, giving, birth, to, live, young, the, majority, of, insects, lay, eggs, but, a, very, few, give, birth, to, offspring, that, are, miniature, versions, of, the, adult, the, aphid, has, a, complex, life, cycle, and, during, the, summer, months, is, able, to, multiply, with, great, rapidity, its, reproduction, is, typically, parthenogenetic, and, viviparous, and, females, produce, unfertilized, eggs, which, they, retain, within, their, bodies, the, embryos, develop, within, their, mothers, ovarioles, and, the, offspring, are, clones, of, their, mothers, female, nymphs, are, born, which, grow, rapidly, and, soon, produce, more, female, offspring, themselves, in, some, instances, the, newborn, nymphs, already, have, developing, embryos, inside, them
