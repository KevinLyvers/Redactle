the, honey, badger, mellivora, capensis, also, known, as, the, ratel, r, t, l, or, r, e, t, l, is, a, mammal, widely, distributed, in, africa, southwest, asia, and, the, indian, subcontinent, because, of, its, wide, range, and, occurrence, in, a, variety, of, habitats, it, is, listed, as, least, concern, on, the, iucn, red, list, it, is, the, only, living, species, in, the, genus, mellivora, and, in, the, mustelid, subfamily, mellivorinae, despite, its, name, the, honey, badger, does, not, closely, resemble, other, badger, species, instead, it, bears, more, anatomical, similarities, to, weasels, it, is, primarily, a, carnivorous, species, and, has, few, natural, predators, because, of, its, thick, skin, strength, and, ferocious, defensive, abilities, viverra, capensis, was, the, scientific, name, used, by, johann, christian, daniel, von, schreber, in, 1777, who, described, a, honey, badger, skin, from, the, cape, of, good, hope, mellivorae, was, proposed, as, name, for, the, genus, by, gottlieb, conrad, christian, storr, in, 1780, mellivorina, was, proposed, as, a, tribe, name, by, john, edward, gray, in, 1865, the, honey, badger, is, the, only, species, of, the, genus, mellivora, although, in, the, 1860s, it, was, assigned, to, the, badger, subfamily, the, melinae, it, is, now, generally, agreed, that, it, bears, few, similarities, to, the, melinae, it, is, much, more, closely, related, to, the, marten, subfamily, guloninae, and, furthermore, is, assigned, its, own, subfamily, mellivorinae, differences, between, mellivorinae, and, guloninae, include, differences, in, their, dentition, formulae, though, not, in, the, same, subfamily, as, the, wolverines, which, are, a, genus, of, large, sized, and, atypical, guloninae, the, honey, badger, can, be, regarded, as, another, analogous, form, of, outsized, weasel, or, polecat, the, species, first, appeared, during, the, middle, pliocene, in, asia, a, number, of, extinct, relatives, are, known, dating, back, at, least, 7, million, years, to, the, late, miocene, these, include, mellivora, benfieldi, from, south, africa, and, italy, promellivora, from, pakistan, and, howellictis, from, chad, more, distant, relatives, include, eomellivora, which, evolved, into, several, different, species, in, both, the, old, and, new, world, and, the, giant, long, legged, ekorus, from, kenya, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, 16, zoological, specimens, of, the, honey, badger, were, described, and, proposed, as, subspecies, as, of, 2005, 12, subspecies, are, recognised, as, valid, taxa, points, taken, into, consideration, in, assigning, different, subspecies, include, size, and, the, extent, of, whiteness, or, greyness, on, the, back, ratel, sparrman, 1777, typicus, smith, 1833, vernayi, roberts, 1932, ratel, horsfield, 1851, ratelus, fraser, 1862, buchanani, thomas, 1925, the, honey, badger, has, a, fairly, long, body, but, is, distinctly, thick, set, and, broad, across, the, back,

to, 35, lb, while, females, weigh, 5, to, 10, kg, 11, to, 22, lb, on, average, the, mean, weight, of, adult, honey, badgers, from, different, areas, has, been, reported, at, anywhere, between, 6, 4, to, 12, kg, 14, to, 26, lb, with, a, median, of, roughly, 9, kg, 20, lb, per, various, studies, this, positions, it, as, the, third, largest, known, badger, after, the, european, badger, and, hog, badger, and, fourth, largest, extant, terrestrial, mustelid, after, additionally, the, wolverine, however, the, average, weight, of, three, wild, females, from, iraq, was, reported, as, 18, kg, 40, lb, about, the, typical, weight, of, male, wolverines, or, male, european, badgers, in, late, autumn, indicating, that, they, can, attain, much, larger, than, typical, sizes, in, favorable,
