see, species, section, adansonia, is, a, genus, made, up, of, eight, species, of, medium, to, large, deciduous, trees, known, as, baobabs, b, a, b, b, or, b, e, o, b, b, or, adansonias, they, are, placed, in, the, malvaceae, family, subfamily, bombacoideae, they, are, native, to, madagascar, mainland, africa, and, australia, the, trees, have, also, been, introduced, to, other, regions, such, as, asia, a, genomic, and, ecological, analysis, has, suggested, that, the, genus, is, madagascan, in, origin, the, generic, name, honours, michel, adanson, the, french, naturalist, and, explorer, who, described, adansonia, digitata, the, baobab, is, also, known, as, the, upside, down, tree, a, name, that, originates, from, several, myths, they, are, among, the, most, long, lived, of, vascular, plants, and, have, large, flowers, that, are, reproductive, for, a, maximum, of, 15, hours, the, flowers, open, around, dusk, opening, so, quickly, that, movement, can, be, detected, by, the, naked, eye, and, are, faded, by, the, next, morning, the, fruits, are, large, oval, to, round, and, berry, like, and, hold, kidney, shaped, seeds, in, a, dry, pulpy, matrix, in, the, early, 21st, century, baobabs, in, southern, africa, began, to, die, off, rapidly, from, a, cause, yet, to, be, determined, it, is, unlikely, that, disease, or, pests, would, be, able, to, kill, many, trees, so, rapidly, and, some, have, speculated, that, the, die, off, is, a, result, of, dehydration, baobabs, are, long, lived, deciduous, small, to, large, trees, from, 5, to, 30, m, 20, to, 100, ft, tall, with, broad, trunks, and, compact, crowns, young, trees, usually, have, slender, tapering, trunks, often, with, a, swollen, base, mature, trees, have, massive, trunks, that, are, bottle, shaped, or, cylindrical, and, tapered, from, bottom, to, top, the, trunk, is, made, of, fibrous, wood, arranged, in, concentric, rings, although, rings, are, not, always, formed, annually, and, so, cannot, be, used, to, determine, the, age, of, individual, trees, tree, diameter, fluctuates, with, rainfall, so, it, is, thought, that, water, may, be, stored, in, the, trunk, baobab, trees, have, two, types, of, shoots, long, green, vegetative, ones, and, stout, woody, reproductive, ones, branches, can, be, massive, and, spread, out, horizontally, from, the, trunk, or, are, ascending, adansonia, gregorii, is, generally, the, smallest, of, the, baobabs, rarely, getting, to, over, 10, m, 33, ft, tall, and, often, with, multiple, trunks, both, a, rubrostipa, and, a, madagascariensis, are, small, to, large, trees, from, 5, to, 20, m, 16, to, 66, ft, tall, the, other, baobabs, grow, from, 25, to, 30, m, 80, to, 100, ft, tall, with, 2, to, 3, m, 7, to, 10, ft, diameter, trunks, a, digitata, however, often, has, massive, single, or, multiple, trunks, of, up, to, 10, m, 33, ft, diameter, leaves, are, palmately, compound, in, mature, trees, but, seedlings, and, regenerating, shoots, may, have, simple, leaves, the, transition, to, compound, leaves, comes, with, age, and, may, be, gradual, leaves, have, 5, 11, leaflets, with, the, largest, ones, in, the, middle, and, may, be, stalkless, or, with, short, petioles, leaflets, may, have, toothed, or, smooth, edges, and, may, be, hairless, or, have, simple, to, clumped, hairs, baobabs, have, stipules, at, the, base, of, the, leaves, but, the, stipules, are, soon, shed, in, most, species, baobabs, are, deciduous, shedding, leaves, during, the, dry, season, in, most, adansonia, species, the, flowers, are, borne, on, short, erect, or, spreading, stalks, in, the, axils, of, the, leaves, near, the, tips, of, reproductive, shoots, only, a, digitata, has, flowers, and, fruits, set, on, long, hanging, stalks, there, is, usually, only, a, single, flower, in, an, axil, but, sometimes, flowers, occur, in, pairs, they, are, large, showy, and, strongly, scented, they, only, open, near, dusk, opening, is, rapid, and, movement, of, the, flower, parts, is, fast, enough, to, be, visible, most, adansonia, species, are, pollinated, by, bats, flowers, may, remain, attached, to, the, trees, for, several, days, but, the, reproductive, phase, is, very, short, with, pollen, shed, during, the, first, night, and, stigmas, shriveled, by, the, morning, the, flower, is, made, up, of, an, outer, 5, lobed, calyx, and, an, inner, ring, of, petals, set, around, a, fused, tube, of, stamens, the, outer, lobes, of, the, calyx, are, usually, green, brown, in, a, grandidieri, and, in, bud, are, joined, almost, to, the, tip, as, the, flower, opens, the, calyx, lobes, split, apart, and, become, coiled, or, bent, back, reflexed, at, the, base, of, the, flower, the, inner, surface, of, the, lobes, are, silky, hairy, and, cream, pink, or, red, sometimes, the, lobes, do, not, separate, cleanly, distorting, the, shape, of, the, flower, as, they, bend, back, the, calyx, lobes, remain, fused, at, the, base, leaving, a, feature, calyx, tube, that, has, nectar, producing, tissue, and, that, is, cup, shaped, flat, or, tubular, the, form, of, the, calyx, tube, varies, with, species, the, flowers, have, a, central, tube, staminal, tube, made, up, of, fused, stalks, of, stamens, filaments, with, unfused, filaments, above, a, densely, hairy, ovary, is, enclosed, in, the, staminal, tube, and, a, long, style, tipped, with, a, stigma, emerges, from, the, filaments, petals, are, set, near, the, base, of, the, staminal, tube, and, are, variable, in, shape, and, colour, the, flowers, when, fresh, may, be, white, cream, bright, yellow, or, dark, red, but, fade, quickly, often, turning, reddish, when, dried, the, fruit, of, the, baobabs, is, one, of, their, distinguishing, features, it, is, large, oval, to, round, and, berry, like, in, most, species, usually, less, than, 10, centimetres, 3, 9, in, long, in, a, madagascariensis, it, has, a, dry, hard, outer, shell, of, variable, thickness, in, most, species, the, shell, is, indehiscent, does, not, break, open, easily, a, gibbosa, is, the, only, species, with, fruits, that, crack, while, still, on, the, tree, which, then, tend, to, break, open, upon, landing, on, the, ground, inside, the, outer, shell, kidney, shaped, seeds, 10, 15, 20, mm, long, are, set, in, a, dry, pulp, the, earliest, written, reports, of, baobab, are, from, a, 14th, century, travelogue, by, the, arab, traveler, ibn, battuta, the, first, botanical, description, was, in, the, de, medicina, aegyptiorum, by, prospero, alpini, 1592, looking, at, fruits, that, he, observed, in, egypt, from, an, unknown, source, they, were, called, bahobab, possibly, from, the, arabic, ab, ib, b, meaning, many, seeded, fruit, the, french, explorer, and, botanist, michel, adanson, 1727, 1806, observed, a, baobab, tree, in, 1749, on, the, island, of, sor, in, senegal, and, wrote, the, first, detailed, botanical, description, of, the, full, tree, accompanied, with, illustrations, recognizing, the, connection, to, the, fruit, described, by, alpini, he, called, the, genus, baobab, linnaeus, later, renamed, the, genus, adansonia, to, honour, adanson, but, use, of, baobab, as, one, of, the, common, names, has, persisted, the, genus, adansonia, is, in, the, subfamily, bombacoideae, within, the, family, malvaceae, in, the, order, malvales, the, subfamily, bombacoideae, was, previously, treated, as, the, bombacaceae, family, but, it, is, no, longer, recognized, at, the, rank, of, family, by, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, group, i, 1998, ii, 2003, or, the, kubitzki, system, 2003, there, are, eight, accepted, species, of, adansonia, a, new, species, adansonia, kilima, pettigrew, et, al, was, described, in, 2012, found, in, high, elevation, sites, in, eastern, and, southern, africa, this, however, is, no, longer, recognized, as, a, distinct, species, but, considered, a, synonym, of, a, digitata, some, high, elevation, trees, in, tanzania, show, different, genetics, and, morphology, but, further, study, is, needed, to, determine, if, recognition, of, them, as, a, separate, species, is, warranted, the, genus, adansonia, is, further, divided, into, three, sections, section, adansonia, includes, only, a, digitata, this, species, has, hanging, flowers, and, fruit, set, on, long, flowering, stalks, this, is, the, type, species, for, the, genus, adansonia, all, species, of, adansonia, except, a, digitata, are, diploid, a, digitata, is, tetraploid, section, brevitubae, includes, a, grandidieri, and, a, suarexensis, these, are, species, with, flower, buds, that, set, on, short, pedicles, and, that, are, approximately, twice, as, long, as, wide, the, other, species, are, all, classified, within, the, section, longitubae, they, also, have, flowers, fruits, set, on, short, pedicels, but, the, flower, buds, are, five, or, more, times, as, long, as, wide, as, of, july, 2020, there, are, eight, recognized, species, of, adansonia, with, six, endemic, to, madagascar, one, native, to, mainland, africa, and, the, arabian, peninsula, and, one, native, to, australia, the, mainland, african, species, adansonia, digitata, also, occurs, on, madagascar, but, it, is, not, a, native, of, that, island, baobabs, were, introduced, in, ancient, times, to, south, asia, and, during, the, colonial, era, to, the, caribbean, they, are, also, present, in, the, island, nation, of, cape, verde, a, ninth, species, was, described, in, 2012, adansonia, kilima, pettigrew, et, al, but, is, no, longer, recognized, as, a, distinct, species, the, african, and, australian, baobabs, are, similar, in, appearance, and, the, oldest, splits, within, adansonia, are, likely, no, older, than, 15, million, years, thus, the, australian, species, represents, a, long, distance, trans, oceanic, dispersal, event, from, africa, the, lineage, leading, to, adansonia, was, found, to, have, diverged, from, its, closest, relatives, in, bombacoideae, like, ceiba, chorisia, at, the, end, of, the, eocene, during, a, time, of, abrupt, global, climate, cooling, and, drying, while, a, divergence, of, this, adansonia, ceiba, chorisia, clade, from, pachira, was, found, to, be, more, ancient, dating, to, the, middle, eocene, the, malagasy, species, are, important, components, of, the, madagascar, dry, deciduous, forests, within, that, biome, adansonia, madagascariensis, and, a, rubrostipa, occur, specifically, in, the, anjajavy, forest, sometimes, growing, out, of, the, tsingy, limestone, itself, a, digitata, has, been, called, a, defining, icon, of, african, bushland, the, tree, also, grows, wild, in, sudan, in, the, regions, of, darfur, and, the, state, of, kordofan, the, locals, call, it, gongolaze, and, use, its, fruits, as, food, and, medicine, and, use, the, tree, trunks, as, reservoirs, to, save, water, baobabs, store, water, in, the, trunk, up, to, 120, 000, litres, or, 32, 000, us, gallons, to, endure, harsh, drought, conditions, all, occur, in, seasonally, arid, areas, and, are, deciduous, shedding, their, leaves, during, the, dry, season, across, africa, the, oldest, and, largest, baobabs, began, to, die, in, the, early, 21st, century, likely, from, a, combination, of, drought, and, rising, temperatures, the, trees, appear, to, become, parched, then, become, dehydrated, and, unable, to, support, their, massive, trunks, baobabs, are, important, as, nest, sites, for, birds, in, particular, the, mottled, spinetail, and, four, species, of, weaver, radiocarbon, dating, has, provided, data, on, a, few, individuals, of, a, digitata, the, panke, baobab, in, zimbabwe, was, some, 2, 450, years, old, when, it, died, in, 2011, making, it, the, oldest, angiosperm, ever, documented, and, two, other, trees, dorslandboom, in, namibia, and, glencoe, in, south, africa, were, estimated, to, be, approximately, 2, 000, years, old, another, specimen, known, as, grootboom, was, dated, and, found, to, be, at, least, 1, 275, years, old, the, glencoe, baobab, a, specimen, of, a, digitata, in, limpopo, province, south, africa, was, considered, to, be, the, largest, living, individual, with, a, maximum, circumference, of, 47, m, 154, ft, and, a, diameter, of, about, 15, 9, m, 52, ft, the, tree, has, since, split, into, two, parts, so, the, widest, individual, trunk, may, now, be, that, of, the, sunland, baobab, or, platland, tree, also, in, south, africa, the, diameter, of, this, tree, at, ground, level, is, 9, 3, m, 31, ft, and, its, circumference, at, breast, height, is, 34, m, 112, ft, two, large, baobabs, growing, in, tsimanampetsotse, national, park, were, also, studied, using, radiocarbon, dating, one, called, grandmother, is, made, up, of, three, fused, trunks, of, different, ages, with, the, oldest, part, of, the, tree, an, estimated, 1, 600, years, old, the, second, polygamous, baobab, has, six, fused, stems, and, is, an, estimated, 1, 000, years, old, the, tree, s, leaves, may, be, eaten, as, a, leaf, vegetable, the, white, pith, in, the, fruit, of, the, australian, baobab, a, gregorii, tastes, like, sherbet, it, has, an, acidic, tart, citrus, flavor, it, is, a, good, source, of, vitamin, c, potassium, carbohydrates, and, phosphorus, the, dried, fruit, powder, of, a, digitata, baobab, powder, contains, about, 11, water, 80, carbohydrates, 50, fiber, and, modest, levels, of, various, nutrients, including, riboflavin, calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, and, phytosterols, with, low, levels, of, protein, and, fats, vitamin, c, content, described, as, variable, in, different, samples, was, in, a, range, of, 74, to, 163, milligrams, 1, 14, to, 2, 52, gr, per, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, of, dried, powder, in, 2008, baobab, dried, fruit, pulp, was, authorized, in, the, eu, as, a, safe, food, ingredient, and, later, in, the, year, was, granted, gras, generally, recognized, as, safe, status, in, the, united, states, in, angola, the, dry, fruit, of, a, digitata, is, usually, boiled, and, the, broth, is, used, for, juices, or, as, the, base, for, a, type, of, ice, cream, known, as, gelado, de, m, cua, in, zimbabwe, the, fruit, of, a, digitata, is, eaten, fresh, or, the, crushed, crumbly, pulp, is, stirred, into, porridge, and, drinks, in, tanzania, the, dry, pulp, of, a, digitata, is, added, to, sugarcane, to, aid, fermentation, in, brewing, beermaking, the, seeds, of, some, species, are, a, source, of, vegetable, oil, the, fruit, pulp, and, seeds, of, a, grandidieri, and, a, za, are, eaten, fresh, some, baobab, species, are, sources, of, fiber, dye, and, fuel, indigenous, australians, used, the, native, species, a, gregorii, for, several, products, making, string, from, the, root, fibers, and, decorative, crafts, from, the, fruits, baobab, oil, from, the, seed, is, also, used, in, cosmetics, particularly, in, moisturizers, baobab, trees, hold, cultural, and, spiritual, significance, in, many, african, societies, they, are, often, the, sites, of, communal, gatherings, storytelling, and, rituals, an, unusual, baobab, was, the, namesake, of, kukawa, formerly, the, capital, of, the, bornu, empire, southwest, of, lake, chad, in, central, africa, in, the, novel, the, little, prince, the, titular, character, takes, care, to, root, out, baobabs, that, try, to, grow, on, his, tiny, planet, home, the, fearsome, grasping, baobab, trees, researchers, have, contended, were, meant, to, represent, nazism, attempting, to, destroy, the, planet
