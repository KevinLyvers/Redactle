intellectual, disability, id, also, known, as, general, learning, disability, in, the, united, kingdom, and, formerly, mental, retardation, in, the, united, states, is, a, generalized, neurodevelopmental, disorder, characterized, by, significant, impairment, in, intellectual, and, adaptive, functioning, that, is, first, apparent, during, childhood, children, with, intellectual, disabilities, typically, have, an, intelligence, quotient, iq, below, 70, and, deficits, in, at, least, two, adaptive, behaviors, that, affect, everyday, general, living, according, to, the, dsm, 5, intellectual, functions, include, reasoning, problem, solving, planning, abstract, thinking, judgment, academic, learning, and, learning, from, experience, deficits, in, these, functions, must, be, confirmed, by, clinical, evaluation, and, individualized, standard, iq, testing, on, the, other, hand, adaptive, behaviors, include, the, social, developmental, and, practical, skills, people, learn, to, perform, tasks, in, their, everyday, lives, deficits, in, adaptive, functioning, often, compromises, an, individual, s, independence, and, ability, to, meet, their, social, responsibility, intellectual, disability, is, subdivided, into, syndromic, intellectual, disability, in, which, intellectual, deficits, associated, with, other, medical, and, behavioral, signs, and, symptoms, are, present, and, non, syndromic, intellectual, disability, in, which, intellectual, deficits, appear, without, other, abnormalities, down, syndrome, and, fragile, x, syndrome, are, examples, of, syndromic, intellectual, disabilities, intellectual, disability, affects, about, 2, 3, of, the, general, population, seventy, five, to, ninety, percent, of, the, affected, people, have, mild, intellectual, disability, non, syndromic, or, idiopathic, cases, account, for, 30, 50, of, these, cases, about, a, quarter, of, cases, are, caused, by, a, genetic, disorder, and, about, 5, of, cases, are, inherited, cases, of, unknown, cause, affect, about, 95, million, people, as, of, 2013, intellectual, disability, id, becomes, apparent, during, childhood, and, involves, deficits, in, mental, abilities, social, skills, and, core, activities, of, daily, living, adls, when, compared, to, same, aged, peers, there, often, are, no, physical, signs, of, mild, forms, of, id, although, there, may, be, characteristic, physical, traits, when, it, is, associated, with, a, genetic, disorder, e, g, down, syndrome, the, level, of, impairment, ranges, in, severity, for, each, person, some, of, the, early, signs, can, include, in, early, childhood, mild, id, iq, 50, 69, may, not, be, obvious, or, identified, until, children, begin, school, even, when, poor, academic, performance, is, recognized, it, may, take, expert, assessment, to, distinguish, mild, intellectual, disability, from, specific, learning, disability, or, emotional, behavioral, disorders, people, with, mild, id, are, capable, of, learning, reading, and, mathematics, skills, to, approximately, the, level, of, a, typical, child, aged, nine, to, twelve, they, can, learn, self, care, and, practical, skills, such, as, cooking, or, using, the, local, mass, transit, system, as, individuals, with, intellectual, disabilities, reach, adulthood, many, learn, to, live, independently, and, maintain, gainful, employment, about, 85, of, persons, with, id, are, likely, to, have, mild, id, moderate, id, iq, 35, 49, is, nearly, always, apparent, within, the, first, years, of, life, speech, delays, are, particularly, common, signs, of, moderate, id, people, with, moderate, intellectual, disabilities, need, considerable, support, in, school, at, home, and, in, the, community, in, order, to, fully, participate, while, their, academic, potential, is, limited, they, can, learn, simple, health, and, safety, skills, and, to, participate, in, simple, activities, as, adults, they, may, live, with, their, parents, in, a, supportive, group, home, or, even, semi, independently, with, significant, supportive, services, to, help, them, for, example, manage, their, finances, as, adults, they, may, work, in, a, sheltered, workshop, about, 10, of, persons, with, id, are, likely, to, have, moderate, id, people, with, severe, id, iq, 20, 34, accounting, for, 3, 5, of, persons, with, id, or, profound, id, iq, 19, or, below, accounting, for, 1, 5, of, persons, with, id, need, more, intensive, support, and, supervision, for, their, entire, lives, they, may, learn, some, adls, but, an, intellectual, disability, is, considered, severe, or, profound, when, individuals, are, unable, to, independently, care, for, themselves, without, ongoing, significant, assistance, from, a, caregiver, throughout, adulthood, individuals, with, profound, id, are, completely, dependent, on, others, for, all, adls, and, to, maintain, their, physical, health, and, safety, they, may, be, able, to, learn, to, participate, in, some, of, these, activities, to, a, limited, degree, intellectual, disability, and, autism, spectrum, disorder, asd, share, clinical, characteristics, which, can, result, in, confusion, while, diagnosing, overlapping, these, two, disorders, while, common, can, be, detrimental, to, a, person, s, well, being, those, with, asd, that, hold, symptoms, of, id, may, be, grouped, into, a, co, diagnosis, in, which, they, are, receiving, treatment, for, a, disorder, they, do, not, have, likewise, those, with, id, that, are, mistaken, to, have, asd, may, be, treated, for, symptoms, of, a, disorder, they, do, not, have, differentiating, between, these, two, disorders, will, allow, clinicians, to, deliver, or, prescribe, the, appropriate, treatments, comorbidity, between, id, and, asd, is, very, common, it, was, estimated, that, roughly, 40, of, those, with, id, also, have, asd, and, roughly, 70, of, those, with, asd, also, have, id, more, recently, research, has, indicated, a, prevalence, of, roughly, 30, for, id, in, individuals, with, asd, both, asd, and, id, require, shortfalls, in, communication, and, social, awareness, as, defining, criteria, in, a, study, conducted, in, 2016, surveying, 2816, cases, it, was, found, that, the, top, subsets, that, help, differentiate, between, those, with, id, and, asd, are, impaired, non, verbal, social, behavior, and, lack, of, social, reciprocity, restricted, interests, strict, adherence, to, routines, stereotyped, and, repetitive, motor, mannerisms, and, preoccupation, with, parts, of, objects, those, with, asd, tend, to, show, more, deficits, in, non, verbal, social, behavior, such, as, body, language, and, understanding, social, cues, in, a, study, done, in, 2008, of, 336, individuals, with, varying, levels, of, id, it, was, found, that, those, with, id, display, fewer, instances, of, repetitive, or, ritualistic, behaviors, it, also, recognized, that, those, with, asd, when, compared, to, those, with, id, were, more, likely, to, isolate, themselves, and, make, less, eye, contact, when, it, comes, to, classification, id, and, asd, have, very, different, guidelines, id, has, a, standardized, assessment, called, the, supports, intensity, scale, sis, this, measures, severity, on, a, system, built, around, how, much, support, an, individual, will, need, while, asd, also, classifies, severity, by, support, needed, there, is, no, standard, assessment, clinicians, are, free, to, diagnose, severity, at, their, own, judgment, among, children, the, cause, of, intellectual, disability, is, unknown, for, one, third, to, one, half, of, cases, about, 5, of, cases, are, inherited, genetic, defects, that, cause, intellectual, disability, but, are, not, inherited, can, be, caused, by, accidents, or, mutations, in, genetic, development, examples, of, such, accidents, are, development, of, an, extra, chromosome, 18, trisomy, 18, and, down, syndrome, which, is, the, most, common, genetic, cause, digeorge, syndrome, and, fetal, alcohol, spectrum, disorders, are, the, next, most, common, causes, some, other, frequently, observed, causes, include, according, to, both, the, american, association, on, intellectual, and, developmental, disabilities, and, the, american, psychiatric, association, s, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, iv, three, criteria, must, be, met, for, a, diagnosis, of, intellectual, disability, significant, limitation, in, general, mental, abilities, intellectual, functioning, significant, limitations, in, one, or, more, areas, of, adaptive, behavior, across, multiple, environments, as, measured, by, an, adaptive, behavior, rating, scale, i, e, communication, self, help, skills, interpersonal, skills, and, more, and, evidence, that, the, limitations, became, apparent, in, childhood, or, adolescence, onset, during, developmental, phase, in, general, people, with, intellectual, disabilities, have, an, iq, below, 70, but, clinical, discretion, may, be, necessary, for, individuals, who, have, a, somewhat, higher, iq, but, severe, impairment, in, adaptive, functioning, it, is, formally, diagnosed, by, an, assessment, of, iq, and, adaptive, behavior, a, third, condition, requiring, onset, during, the, developmental, period, is, used, to, distinguish, intellectual, disability, from, other, conditions, such, as, traumatic, brain, injuries, and, dementias, including, alzheimer, s, disease, the, first, english, language, iq, test, the, stanford, binet, intelligence, scales, was, adapted, from, a, test, battery, designed, for, school, placement, by, alfred, binet, in, france, lewis, terman, adapted, binet, s, test, and, promoted, it, as, a, test, measuring, general, intelligence, terman, s, test, was, the, first, widely, used, mental, test, to, report, scores, in, intelligence, quotient, form, mental, age, divided, by, chronological, age, multiplied, by, 100, current, tests, are, scored, in, deviation, iq, form, with, a, performance, level, by, a, test, taker, two, standard, deviations, below, the, median, score, for, the, test, takers, age, group, defined, as, iq, 70, until, the, most, recent, revision, of, diagnostic, standards, an, iq, of, 70, or, below, was, a, primary, factor, for, intellectual, disability, diagnosis, and, iq, scores, were, used, to, categorize, degrees, of, intellectual, disability, since, the, current, diagnosis, of, intellectual, disability, is, not, based, on, iq, scores, alone, but, must, also, take, into, consideration, a, person, s, adaptive, functioning, the, diagnosis, is, not, made, rigidly, it, encompasses, intellectual, scores, adaptive, functioning, scores, from, an, adaptive, behavior, rating, scale, based, on, descriptions, of, known, abilities, provided, by, someone, familiar, with, the, person, and, also, the, observations, of, the, assessment, examiner, who, is, able, to, find, out, directly, from, the, person, what, they, can, understand, communicate, and, such, like, iq, assessment, must, be, based, on, a, current, test, this, enables, a, diagnosis, to, avoid, the, pitfall, of, the, flynn, effect, which, is, a, consequence, of, changes, in, population, iq, test, performance, changing, iq, test, norms, over, time, clinically, intellectual, disability, is, a, subtype, of, cognitive, deficit, or, disabilities, affecting, intellectual, abilities, which, is, a, broader, concept, and, includes, intellectual, deficits, that, are, too, mild, to, properly, qualify, as, intellectual, disability, or, too, specific, as, in, specific, learning, disability, or, acquired, later, in, life, through, acquired, brain, injuries, or, neurodegenerative, diseases, like, dementia, cognitive, deficits, may, appear, at, any, age, developmental, disability, is, any, disability, that, is, due, to, problems, with, growth, and, development, this, term, encompasses, many, congenital, medical, conditions, that, have, no, mental, or, intellectual, components, although, it, too, is, sometimes, used, as, a, euphemism, for, intellectual, disability, adaptive, behavior, or, adaptive, functioning, refers, to, the, skills, needed, to, live, independently, or, at, the, minimally, acceptable, level, for, age, to, assess, adaptive, behavior, professionals, compare, the, functional, abilities, of, a, child, to, those, of, other, children, of, similar, age, to, measure, adaptive, behavior, professionals, use, structured, interviews, with, which, they, systematically, elicit, information, about, persons, functioning, in, the, community, from, people, who, know, them, well, there, are, many, adaptive, behavior, scales, and, accurate, assessment, of, the, quality, of, someone, s, adaptive, behavior, requires, clinical, judgment, as, well, certain, skills, are, important, to, adaptive, behavior, such, as, other, specific, skills, can, be, critical, to, an, individual, s, inclusion, in, the, community, and, to, develop, appropriate, social, behaviors, as, for, example, being, aware, of, the, different, social, expectations, linked, to, the, principal, lifespan, stages, i, e, childhood, adulthood, old, age, the, results, of, a, swiss, study, suggest, that, the, performance, of, adults, with, id, in, recognizing, different, lifespan, stages, is, related, to, specific, cognitive, abilities, and, to, the, type, of, material, used, to, test, this, performance, by, most, definitions, intellectual, disability, is, more, accurately, considered, a, disability, rather, than, a, disease, intellectual, disability, can, be, distinguished, in, many, ways, from, mental, illness, such, as, schizophrenia, or, depression, currently, there, is, no, cure, for, an, established, disability, though, with, appropriate, support, and, teaching, most, individuals, can, learn, to, do, many, things, causes, such, as, congenital, hypothyroidism, if, detected, early, may, be, treated, to, prevent, the, development, of, an, intellectual, disability, there, are, thousands, of, agencies, around, the, world, that, provide, assistance, for, people, with, developmental, disabilities, they, include, state, run, for, profit, and, non, profit, privately, run, agencies, within, one, agency, there, could, be, departments, that, include, fully, staffed, residential, homes, day, rehabilitation, programs, that, approximate, schools, workshops, wherein, people, with, disabilities, can, obtain, jobs, programs, that, assist, people, with, developmental, disabilities, in, obtaining, jobs, in, the, community, programs, that, provide, support, for, people, with, developmental, disabilities, who, have, their, own, apartments, programs, that, assist, them, with, raising, their, children, and, many, more, there, are, also, many, agencies, and, programs, for, parents, of, children, with, developmental, disabilities, beyond, that, there, are, specific, programs, that, people, with, developmental, disabilities, can, take, part, in, wherein, they, learn, basic, life, skills, these, goals, may, take, a, much, longer, amount, of, time, for, them, to, accomplish, but, the, ultimate, goal, is, independence, this, may, be, anything, from, independence, in, tooth, brushing, to, an, independent, residence, people, with, developmental, disabilities, learn, throughout, their, lives, and, can, obtain, many, new, skills, even, late, in, life, with, the, help, of, their, families, caregivers, clinicians, and, the, people, who, coordinate, the, efforts, of, all, of, these, people, there, are, four, broad, areas, of, intervention, that, allow, for, active, participation, from, caregivers, community, members, clinicians, and, of, course, the, individual, s, with, an, intellectual, disability, these, include, psychosocial, treatments, behavioral, treatments, cognitive, behavioral, treatments, and, family, oriented, strategies, psychosocial, treatments, are, intended, primarily, for, children, before, and, during, the, preschool, years, as, this, is, the, optimum, time, for, intervention, this, early, intervention, should, include, encouragement, of, exploration, mentoring, in, basic, skills, celebration, of, developmental, advances, guided, rehearsal, and, extension, of, newly, acquired, skills, protection, from, harmful, displays, of, disapproval, teasing, or, punishment, and, exposure, to, a, rich, and, responsive, language, environment, a, great, example, of, a, successful, intervention, is, the, carolina, abecedarian, project, that, was, conducted, with, over, 100, children, from, low, socioeconomic, status, families, beginning, in, infancy, through, pre, school, years, results, indicated, that, by, age, 2, the, children, provided, the, intervention, had, higher, test, scores, than, control, group, children, and, they, remained, approximately, 5, points, higher, 10, years, after, the, end, of, the, program, by, young, adulthood, children, from, the, intervention, group, had, better, educational, attainment, employment, opportunities, and, fewer, behavioral, problems, than, their, control, group, counterparts, core, components, of, behavioral, treatments, include, language, and, social, skills, acquisition, typically, one, to, one, training, is, offered, in, which, a, therapist, uses, a, shaping, procedure, in, combination, with, positive, reinforcements, to, help, the, child, pronounce, syllables, until, words, are, completed, sometimes, involving, pictures, and, visual, aids, therapists, aim, at, improving, speech, capacity, so, that, short, sentences, about, important, daily, tasks, e, g, bathroom, use, eating, etc, can, be, effectively, communicated, by, the, child, in, a, similar, fashion, older, children, benefit, from, this, type, of, training, as, they, learn, to, sharpen, their, social, skills, such, as, sharing, taking, turns, following, instruction, and, smiling, at, the, same, time, a, movement, known, as, social, inclusion, attempts, to, increase, valuable, interactions, between, children, with, an, intellectual, disability, and, their, non, disabled, peers, cognitive, behavioral, treatments, a, combination, of, the, previous, two, treatment, types, involves, a, strategical, metastrategical, learning, technique, that, teaches, children, math, language, and, other, basic, skills, pertaining, to, memory, and, learning, the, first, goal, of, the, training, is, to, teach, the, child, to, be, a, strategical, thinker, through, making, cognitive, connections, and, plans, then, the, therapist, teaches, the, child, to, be, metastrategical, by, teaching, them, to, discriminate, among, different, tasks, and, determine, which, plan, or, strategy, suits, each, task, finally, family, oriented, strategies, delve, into, empowering, the, family, with, the, skill, set, they, need, to, support, and, encourage, their, child, or, children, with, an, intellectual, disability, in, general, this, includes, teaching, assertiveness, skills, or, behavior, management, techniques, as, well, as, how, to, ask, for, help, from, neighbors, extended, family, or, day, care, staff, as, the, child, ages, parents, are, then, taught, how, to, approach, topics, such, as, housing, residential, care, employment, and, relationships, the, ultimate, goal, for, every, intervention, or, technique, is, to, give, the, child, autonomy, and, a, sense, of, independence, using, the, acquired, skills, they, have, in, a, 2019, cochrane, review, on, beginning, reading, interventions, for, children, and, adolescents, with, intellectual, disability, small, to, moderate, improvements, in, phonological, awareness, word, reading, decoding, expressive, and, receptive, language, skills, and, reading, fluency, were, noted, when, these, elements, were, part, of, the, teaching, intervention, although, there, is, no, specific, medication, for, intellectual, disability, many, people, with, developmental, disabilities, have, further, medical, complications, and, may, be, prescribed, several, medications, for, example, autistic, children, with, developmental, delay, may, be, prescribed, antipsychotics, or, mood, stabilizers, to, help, with, their, behavior, use, of, psychotropic, medications, such, as, benzodiazepines, in, people, with, intellectual, disability, requires, monitoring, and, vigilance, as, side, effects, occur, commonly, and, are, often, misdiagnosed, as, behavioral, and, psychiatric, problems, intellectual, disability, affects, about, 2, 3, of, the, general, population, 75, 90, of, the, affected, people, have, mild, intellectual, disability, non, syndromic, or, idiopathic, id, accounts, for, 30, 50, of, cases, about, a, quarter, of, cases, are, caused, by, a, genetic, disorder, cases, of, unknown, cause, affect, about, 95, million, people, as, of, 2013, it, is, more, common, in, males, and, in, low, to, middle, income, countries, intellectual, disability, has, been, documented, under, a, variety, of, names, throughout, history, throughout, much, of, human, history, society, was, unkind, to, those, with, any, type, of, disability, and, people, with, intellectual, disability, were, commonly, viewed, as, burdens, on, their, families, greek, and, roman, philosophers, who, valued, reasoning, abilities, disparaged, people, with, intellectual, disability, as, barely, human, the, oldest, physiological, view, of, intellectual, disability, is, in, the, writings, of, hippocrates, in, the, late, fifth, century, bce, who, believed, that, it, was, caused, by, an, imbalance, in, the, four, humors, in, the, brain, in, ancient, rome, people, with, intellectual, disabilities, had, limited, rights, and, were, generally, looked, down, upon, they, were, considered, property, and, could, be, kept, slaves, by, their, father, these, people, could, also, not, marry, hold, office, or, raise, children, many, of, them, were, killed, early, in, the, childhood, and, then, dumped, into, the, tiber, in, order, to, avoid, them, burdening, society, however, they, were, exempt, from, their, crimes, under, roman, law, and, they, were, also, used, to, perform, menial, labor, caliph, al, walid, r, 705, 715, built, one, of, the, first, care, homes, for, individuals, with, intellectual, disabilities, and, built, the, first, hospital, which, accommodated, intellectually, disabled, individuals, as, part, of, its, services, in, addition, al, walid, assigned, each, intellectually, disabled, individual, a, caregiver, until, the, enlightenment, in, europe, care, and, asylum, was, provided, by, families, and, the, church, in, monasteries, and, other, religious, communities, focusing, on, the, provision, of, basic, physical, needs, such, as, food, shelter, and, clothing, negative, stereotypes, were, prominent, in, social, attitudes, of, the, time, in, the, 13th, century, england, declared, people, with, intellectual, disabilities, to, be, incapable, of, making, decisions, or, managing, their, affairs, guardianships, were, created, to, take, over, their, financial, affairs, in, the, 17th, century, thomas, willis, provided, the, first, description, of, intellectual, disability, as, a, disease, he, believed, that, it, was, caused, by, structural, problems, in, the, brain, according, to, willis, the, anatomical, problems, could, be, either, an, inborn, condition, or, acquired, later, in, life, the, first, known, person, in, the, british, colonies, with, an, intellectual, disability, was, benoni, buck, son, of, richard, buck, whose, life, and, guardianship, battles, provide, significant, insight, into, the, early, legal, and, social, treatment, of, people, with, disabilities, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, housing, and, care, moved, away, from, families, and, towards, an, asylum, model, people, were, placed, by, or, removed, from, their, families, usually, in, infancy, and, housed, in, large, professional, institutions, many, of, which, were, self, sufficient, through, the, labor, of, the, residents, some, of, these, institutions, provided, a, very, basic, level, of, education, such, as, differentiation, between, colors, and, basic, word, recognition, and, numeracy, but, most, continued, to, focus, solely, on, the, provision, of, basic, needs, of, food, clothing, and, shelter, conditions, in, such, institutions, varied, widely, but, the, support, provided, was, generally, non, individualized, with, aberrant, behavior, and, low, levels, of, economic, productivity, regarded, as, a, burden, to, society, individuals, of, higher, wealth, were, often, able, to, afford, higher, degrees, of, care, such, as, home, care, or, private, asylums, heavy, tranquilization, and, assembly, line, methods, of, support, were, the, norm, and, the, medical, model, of, disability, prevailed, services, were, provided, based, on, the, relative, ease, to, the, provider, not, based, on, the, needs, of, the, individual, a, survey, taken, in, 1891, in, cape, town, south, africa, shows, the, distribution, between, different, facilities, out, of, 2, 046, persons, surveyed, 1, 281, were, in, private, dwellings, 120, in, jails, and, 645, in, asylums, with, men, representing, nearly, two, thirds, of, the, number, surveyed, in, situations, of, scarcity, of, accommodation, preference, was, given, to, white, men, and, black, men, whose, insanity, threatened, white, society, by, disrupting, employment, relations, and, the, taboo, sexual, contact, with, white, women, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, response, to, charles, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, francis, galton, proposed, selective, breeding, of, humans, to, reduce, intellectual, disability, early, in, the, 20th, century, the, eugenics, movement, became, popular, throughout, the, world, this, led, to, forced, sterilization, and, prohibition, of, marriage, in, most, of, the, developed, world, and, was, later, used, by, adolf, hitler, as, a, rationale, for, the, mass, murder, of, people, with, intellectual, disability, during, the, holocaust, eugenics, was, later, abandoned, as, a, violation, of, human, rights, and, the, practice, of, forced, sterilization, and, prohibition, from, marriage, was, discontinued, by, most, of, the, developed, world, by, the, mid, 20th, century, in, 1905, alfred, binet, produced, the, first, standardized, test, for, measuring, intelligence, in, children, although, ancient, roman, law, had, declared, people, with, intellectual, disability, to, be, incapable, of, the, deliberate, intent, to, harm, that, was, necessary, for, a, person, to, commit, a, crime, during, the, 1920s, western, society, believed, they, were, morally, degenerate, ignoring, the, prevailing, attitude, u, s, based, civitans, adopted, service, to, people, with, developmental, disabilities, as, a, major, organizational, emphasis, in, 1952, their, earliest, efforts, included, workshops, for, special, education, teachers, and, daycamps, for, children, with, disabilities, all, at, a, time, when, such, training, and, programs, were, almost, nonexistent, the, segregation, of, people, with, developmental, disabilities, was, not, widely, questioned, by, academics, or, policy, makers, until, the, 1969, publication, of, wolf, wolfensberger, s, seminal, work, the, origin, and, nature, of, our, institutional, models, drawing, on, some, of, the, ideas, proposed, by, s, g, howe, 100, years, earlier, this, study, posited, that, society, characterizes, people, with, disabilities, as, deviant, sub, human, and, burdens, of, charity, resulting, in, the, adoption, of, that, deviant, role, wolfensberger, argued, that, this, dehumanization, and, the, segregated, institutions, that, result, from, it, ignored, the, potential, productive, contributions, that, all, people, can, make, to, society, he, pushed, for, a, shift, in, policy, and, practice, that, recognized, the, human, needs, of, those, with, intellectual, disability, and, provided, the, same, basic, human, rights, as, for, the, rest, of, the, population, this, publication, may, be, regarded, as, the, first, move, towards, the, widespread, adoption, of, the, social, model, of, disability, in, regard, to, these, types, of, disabilities, and, was, the, impetus, for, the, development, of,
