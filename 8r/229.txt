pregnancy, is, the, time, during, which, one, or, more, offspring, develops, gestates, inside, a, woman, s, uterus, womb, a, multiple, pregnancy, involves, more, than, one, offspring, such, as, with, twins, pregnancy, usually, occurs, by, sexual, intercourse, but, can, also, occur, through, assisted, reproductive, technology, procedures, a, pregnancy, may, end, in, a, live, birth, a, miscarriage, an, induced, abortion, or, a, stillbirth, childbirth, typically, occurs, around, 40, weeks, from, the, start, of, the, last, menstrual, period, lmp, a, span, known, as, the, gestational, age, this, is, just, over, nine, months, counting, by, fertilization, age, the, length, is, about, 38, weeks, pregnancy, is, the, presence, of, an, implanted, human, embryo, or, fetus, in, the, uterus, implantation, occurs, on, average, 8, 9, days, after, fertilization, an, embryo, is, the, term, for, the, developing, offspring, during, the, first, seven, weeks, following, implantation, i, e, ten, weeks, gestational, age, after, which, the, term, fetus, is, used, until, birth, signs, and, symptoms, of, early, pregnancy, may, include, missed, periods, tender, breasts, morning, sickness, nausea, and, vomiting, hunger, implantation, bleeding, and, frequent, urination, pregnancy, may, be, confirmed, with, a, pregnancy, test, methods, of, birth, control, or, more, accurately, contraception, are, used, to, avoid, pregnancy, pregnancy, is, divided, into, three, trimesters, of, approximately, three, months, each, the, first, trimester, includes, conception, which, is, when, the, sperm, fertilizes, the, egg, the, fertilized, egg, then, travels, down, the, fallopian, tube, and, attaches, to, the, inside, of, the, uterus, where, it, begins, to, form, the, embryo, and, placenta, during, the, first, trimester, the, possibility, of, miscarriage, natural, death, of, embryo, or, fetus, is, at, its, highest, around, the, middle, of, the, second, trimester, movement, of, the, fetus, may, be, felt, at, 28, weeks, more, than, 90, of, babies, can, survive, outside, of, the, uterus, if, provided, with, high, quality, medical, care, though, babies, born, at, this, time, will, likely, experience, serious, health, complications, such, as, heart, and, respiratory, problems, and, long, term, intellectual, and, developmental, disabilities, prenatal, care, improves, pregnancy, outcomes, nutrition, during, pregnancy, is, important, to, ensure, healthy, growth, of, the, fetus, prenatal, care, may, also, include, avoiding, recreational, drugs, including, tobacco, and, alcohol, taking, regular, exercise, having, blood, tests, and, regular, physical, examinations, complications, of, pregnancy, may, include, disorders, of, high, blood, pressure, gestational, diabetes, iron, deficiency, anemia, and, severe, nausea, and, vomiting, in, the, ideal, childbirth, labor, begins, on, its, own, at, term, babies, born, before, 37, weeks, are, preterm, and, at, higher, risk, of, health, problems, such, as, cerebral, palsy, babies, born, between, weeks, 37, and, 39, are, considered, early, term, while, those, born, between, weeks, 39, and, 41, are, considered, full, term, babies, born, between, weeks, 41, and, 42, weeks, are, considered, late, term, while, after, 42, weeks, they, are, considered, post, term, delivery, before, 39, weeks, by, labor, induction, or, caesarean, section, is, not, recommended, unless, required, for, other, medical, reasons, associated, terms, for, pregnancy, are, gravid, and, parous, gravidus, and, gravid, come, from, the, latin, word, meaning, heavy, and, a, pregnant, female, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, gravida, gravidity, refers, to, the, number, of, times, that, a, female, has, been, pregnant, similarly, the, term, parity, is, used, for, the, number, of, times, that, a, female, carries, a, pregnancy, to, a, viable, stage, twins, and, other, multiple, births, are, counted, as, one, pregnancy, and, birth, a, woman, who, has, never, been, pregnant, is, referred, to, as, a, nulligravida, a, woman, who, is, or, has, been, only, pregnant, for, the, first, time, is, referred, to, as, a, primigravida, and, a, woman, in, subsequent, pregnancies, as, a, multigravida, or, as, multiparous, therefore, during, a, second, pregnancy, a, woman, would, be, described, as, gravida, 2, para, 1, and, upon, live, delivery, as, gravida, 2, para, 2, in, progress, pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages, and, or, stillbirths, account, for, parity, values, being, less, than, the, gravida, number, women, who, have, never, carried, a, pregnancy, more, than, 20, weeks, are, referred, to, as, nulliparous, a, pregnancy, is, considered, term, at, 37, weeks, of, gestation, it, is, preterm, if, less, than, 37, weeks, and, postterm, at, or, beyond, 42, weeks, of, gestation, american, college, of, obstetricians, and, gynecologists, have, recommended, further, division, with, early, term, 37, weeks, up, to, 39, weeks, full, term, 39, weeks, up, to, 41, weeks, and, late, term, 41, weeks, up, to, 42, weeks, the, terms, preterm, and, postterm, have, largely, replaced, earlier, terms, of, premature, and, postmature, preterm, and, postterm, are, defined, above, whereas, premature, and, postmature, have, historical, meaning, and, relate, more, to, the, infant, s, size, and, state, of, development, rather, than, to, the, stage, of, pregnancy, about, 213, million, pregnancies, occurred, in, 2012, of, which, 190, million, 89, were, in, the, developing, world, and, 23, million, 11, were, in, the, developed, world, the, number, of, pregnancies, in, women, aged, between, 15, and, 44, is, 133, per, 1, 000, women, about, 10, to, 15, of, recognized, pregnancies, end, in, miscarriage, in, 2016, complications, of, pregnancy, resulted, in, 230, 600, maternal, deaths, down, from, 377, 000, deaths, in, 1990, common, causes, include, bleeding, infections, hypertensive, diseases, of, pregnancy, obstructed, labor, miscarriage, abortion, or, ectopic, pregnancy, globally, 44, of, pregnancies, are, unplanned, over, half, 56, of, unplanned, pregnancies, are, aborted, among, unintended, pregnancies, in, the, united, states, 60, of, the, women, used, birth, control, to, some, extent, during, the, month, pregnancy, began, the, usual, signs, and, symptoms, of, pregnancy, do, not, significantly, interfere, with, activities, of, daily, living, or, pose, a, health, threat, to, the, mother, or, baby, however, pregnancy, complications, can, cause, other, more, severe, symptoms, such, as, those, associated, with, anemia, common, signs, and, symptoms, of, pregnancy, include, from, the, start, of, the, last, menstrual, period, the, chronology, of, pregnancy, is, unless, otherwise, specified, generally, given, as, gestational, age, where, the, starting, point, is, the, beginning, of, the, woman, s, last, menstrual, period, lmp, or, the, corresponding, age, of, the, gestation, as, estimated, by, a, more, accurate, method, if, available, this, model, means, that, the, woman, is, counted, as, being, pregnant, two, weeks, before, conception, and, three, weeks, before, implantation, sometimes, timing, may, also, use, the, fertilization, age, which, is, the, age, of, the, embryo, since, conception, the, american, congress, of, obstetricians, and, gynecologists, recommends, the, following, methods, to, calculate, gestational, age, pregnancy, is, divided, into, three, trimesters, each, lasting, for, approximately, three, months, the, exact, length, of, each, trimester, can, vary, between, sources, due, date, estimation, basically, follows, two, steps, the, american, college, of, obstetricians, and, gynecologists, divides, full, term, into, three, divisions, naegele, s, rule, is, a, standard, way, of, calculating, the, due, date, for, a, pregnancy, when, assuming, a, gestational, age, of, 280, days, at, childbirth, the, rule, estimates, the, expected, date, of, delivery, edd, by, adding, a, year, subtracting, three, months, and, adding, seven, days, to, the, origin, of, gestational, age, alternatively, there, are, mobile, apps, which, essentially, always, give, consistent, estimations, compared, to, each, other, and, correct, for, leap, year, while, pregnancy, wheels, made, of, paper, can, differ, from, each, other, by, 7, days, and, generally, do, not, correct, for, leap, year, furthermore, actual, childbirth, has, only, a, certain, probability, of, occurring, within, the, limits, of, the, estimated, due, date, a, study, of, singleton, live, births, came, to, the, result, that, childbirth, has, a, standard, deviation, of, 14, days, when, gestational, age, is, estimated, by, first, trimester, ultrasound, and, 16, days, when, estimated, directly, by, last, menstrual, period, fertility, and, fecundity, are, the, respective, capacities, to, fertilize, and, establish, a, clinical, pregnancy, and, have, a, live, birth, infertility, is, an, impaired, ability, to, establish, a, clinical, pregnancy, and, sterility, is, the, permanent, inability, to, establish, a, clinical, pregnancy, the, capacity, for, pregnancy, depends, on, the, reproductive, system, its, development, and, its, variation, as, well, as, on, the, condition, of, a, person, women, as, well, as, intersex, and, transgender, people, who, have, a, functioning, female, reproductive, system, are, capable, of, pregnancy, in, some, cases, someone, might, be, able, to, produce, fertilizable, eggs, but, might, not, have, a, womb, or, none, that, can, sufficiently, gestate, in, which, case, they, might, find, surrogacy, through, an, interplay, of, hormones, that, includes, follicle, stimulating, hormone, that, stimulates, folliculogenesis, and, oogenesis, creates, a, mature, egg, cell, the, female, gamete, fertilization, is, the, event, where, the, egg, cell, fuses, with, the, male, gamete, spermatozoon, after, the, point, of, fertilization, the, fused, product, of, the, female, and, male, gamete, is, referred, to, as, a, zygote, or, fertilized, egg, the, fusion, of, female, and, male, gametes, usually, occurs, following, the, act, of, sexual, intercourse, pregnancy, rates, for, sexual, intercourse, are, highest, during, the, menstrual, cycle, time, from, some, 5, days, before, until, 1, to, 2, days, after, ovulation, fertilization, can, also, occur, by, assisted, reproductive, technology, such, as, artificial, insemination, and, in, vitro, fertilisation, fertilization, conception, is, sometimes, used, as, the, initiation, of, pregnancy, with, the, derived, age, being, termed, fertilization, age, fertilization, usually, occurs, about, two, weeks, before, the, next, expected, menstrual, period, a, third, point, in, time, is, also, considered, by, some, people, to, be, the, true, beginning, of, a, pregnancy, this, is, time, of, implantation, when, the, future, fetus, attaches, to, the, lining, of, the, uterus, this, is, about, a, week, to, ten, days, after, fertilization, the, sperm, and, the, egg, cell, which, has, been, released, from, one, of, the, female, s, two, ovaries, unite, in, one, of, the, two, fallopian, tubes, the, fertilized, egg, known, as, a, zygote, then, moves, toward, the, uterus, a, journey, that, can, take, up, to, a, week, to, complete, cell, division, begins, approximately, 24, to, 36, hours, after, the, female, and, male, cells, unite, cell, division, continues, at, a, rapid, rate, and, the, cells, then, develop, into, what, is, known, as, a, blastocyst, the, blastocyst, arrives, at, the, uterus, and, attaches, to, the, uterine, wall, a, process, known, as, implantation, the, development, of, the, mass, of, cells, that, will, become, the, infant, is, called, embryogenesis, during, the, first, approximately, ten, weeks, of, gestation, during, this, time, cells, begin, to, differentiate, into, the, various, body, systems, the, basic, outlines, of, the, organ, body, and, nervous, systems, are, established, by, the, end, of, the, embryonic, stage, the, beginnings, of, features, such, as, fingers, eyes, mouth, and, ears, become, visible, also, during, this, time, there, is, development, of, structures, important, to, the, support, of, the, embryo, including, the, placenta, and, umbilical, cord, the, placenta, connects, the, developing, embryo, to, the, uterine, wall, to, allow, nutrient, uptake, waste, elimination, and, gas, exchange, via, the, mother, s, blood, supply, the, umbilical, cord, is, the, connecting, cord, from, the, embryo, or, fetus, to, the, placenta, after, about, ten, weeks, of, gestational, age, which, is, the, same, as, eight, weeks, after, conception, the, embryo, becomes, known, as, a, fetus, at, the, beginning, of, the, fetal, stage, the, risk, of, miscarriage, decreases, sharply, at, this, stage, a, fetus, is, about, 30, mm, 1, 2, inches, in, length, the, heartbeat, is, seen, via, ultrasound, and, the, fetus, makes, involuntary, motions, during, continued, fetal, development, the, early, body, systems, and, structures, that, were, established, in, the, embryonic, stage, continue, to, develop, sex, organs, begin, to, appear, during, the, third, month, of, gestation, the, fetus, continues, to, grow, in, both, weight, and, length, although, the, majority, of, the, physical, growth, occurs, in, the, last, weeks, of, pregnancy, electrical, brain, activity, is, first, detected, at, the, end, of, week, 5, of, gestation, but, as, in, brain, dead, patients, it, is, primitive, neural, activity, rather, than, the, beginning, of, conscious, brain, activity, synapses, do, not, begin, to, form, until, week, 17, neural, connections, between, the, sensory, cortex, and, thalamus, develop, as, early, as, 24, weeks, gestational, age, but, the, first, evidence, of, their, function, does, not, occur, until, around, 30, weeks, when, minimal, consciousness, dreaming, and, the, ability, to, feel, pain, emerges, although, the, fetus, begins, to, move, during, the, first, trimester, it, is, not, until, the, second, trimester, that, movement, known, as, quickening, can, be, felt, this, typically, happens, in, the, fourth, month, more, specifically, in, the, 20th, to, 21st, week, or, by, the, 19th, week, if, the, woman, has, been, pregnant, before, it, is, common, for, some, women, not, to, feel, the, fetus, move, until, much, later, during, the, second, trimester, when, the, body, size, changes, maternity, clothes, may, be, worn, during, pregnancy, a, woman, undergoes, many, normal, physiological, changes, including, behavioral, cardiovascular, hematologic, metabolic, renal, and, respiratory, changes, increases, in, blood, sugar, breathing, and, cardiac, output, are, all, required, levels, of, progesterone, and, estrogens, rise, continually, throughout, pregnancy, suppressing, the, hypothalamic, axis, and, therefore, the, menstrual, cycle, a, full, term, pregnancy, at, an, early, age, less, than, 25, years, reduces, the, risk, of, breast, ovarian, and, endometrial, cancer, and, the, risk, declines, further, with, each, additional, full, term, pregnancy, the, fetus, is, genetically, different, from, its, mother, and, can, therefore, be, viewed, as, an, unusually, successful, allograft, the, main, reason, for, this, success, is, increased, immune, tolerance, during, pregnancy, which, prevents, the, mother, s, body, from, mounting, an, immune, system, response, against, certain, triggers, during, the, first, trimester, minute, ventilation, increases, by, 40, percent, the, womb, will, grow, to, the, size, of, a, lemon, by, eight, weeks, many, symptoms, and, discomforts, of, pregnancy, such, as, nausea, and, tender, breasts, appear, in, the, first, trimester, during, the, second, trimester, most, women, feel, more, energized, and, put, on, weight, as, the, symptoms, of, morning, sickness, subside, they, begin, to, feel, regular, fetal, movements, which, can, become, strong, and, even, disruptive, braxton, hicks, contractions, are, sporadic, uterine, contractions, that, may, start, around, six, weeks, into, a, pregnancy, however, they, are, usually, not, felt, until, the, second, or, third, trimester, final, weight, gain, takes, place, during, the, third, trimester, this, is, the, most, weight, gain, throughout, the, pregnancy, the, woman, s, abdomen, will, transform, in, shape, as, the, fetus, turns, in, a, downward, position, ready, for, birth, the, woman, s, navel, will, sometimes, become, convex, popping, out, due, to, the, expanding, abdomen, the, uterus, the, muscular, organ, that, holds, the, developing, fetus, can, expand, up, to, 20, times, its, normal, size, during, pregnancy, head, engagement, also, called, lightening, or, dropping, occurs, as, the, fetal, head, descends, into, a, cephalic, presentation, while, it, relieves, pressure, on, the, upper, abdomen, and, gives, a, renewed, ease, in, breathing, it, also, severely, reduces, bladder, capacity, resulting, in, a, need, to, void, more, frequently, and, increases, pressure, on, the, pelvic, floor, and, the, rectum, it, is, not, possible, to, predict, when, lightening, will, occur, in, a, first, pregnancy, it, may, happen, a, few, weeks, before, the, due, date, though, it, may, happen, later, or, even, not, until, labor, begins, as, is, typical, with, subsequent, pregnancies, it, is, during, the, third, trimester, that, maternal, activity, and, sleep, positions, may, affect, fetal, development, due, to, restricted, blood, flow, for, instance, the, enlarged, uterus, may, impede, blood, flow, by, compressing, the, vena, cava, when, lying, flat, a, condition, that, can, be, relieved, by, lying, on, the, left, side, childbirth, referred, to, as, labor, and, delivery, in, the, medical, field, is, the, process, whereby, an, infant, is, born, a, woman, is, considered, to, be, in, labor, when, she, begins, experiencing, regular, uterine, contractions, accompanied, by, changes, of, her, cervix, primarily, effacement, and, dilation, while, childbirth, is, widely, experienced, as, painful, some, women, do, report, painless, labors, while, others, find, that, concentrating, on, the, birth, helps, to, quicken, labor, and, lessen, the, sensations, most, births, are, successful, vaginal, births, but, sometimes, complications, arise, and, a, woman, may, undergo, a, cesarean, section, during, the, time, immediately, after, birth, both, the, mother, and, the, baby, are, hormonally, cued, to, bond, the, mother, through, the, release, of, oxytocin, a, hormone, also, released, during, breastfeeding, studies, show, that, skin, to, skin, contact, between, a, mother, and, her, newborn, immediately, after, birth, is, beneficial, for, both, the, mother, and, baby, a, review, done, by, the, world, health, organization, found, that, skin, to, skin, contact, between, mothers, and, babies, after, birth, reduces, crying, improves, mother, infant, interaction, and, helps, mothers, to, breastfeed, successfully, they, recommend, that, neonates, be, allowed, to, bond, with, the, mother, during, their, first, two, hours, after, birth, the, period, that, they, tend, to, be, more, alert, than, in, the, following, hours, of, early, life, in, the, ideal, childbirth, labor, begins, on, its, own, when, a, woman, is, at, term, events, before, completion, of, 37, weeks, are, considered, preterm, preterm, birth, is, associated, with, a, range, of, complications, and, should, be, avoided, if, possible, sometimes, if, a, woman, s, water, breaks, or, she, has, contractions, before, 39, weeks, birth, is, unavoidable, however, spontaneous, birth, after, 37, weeks, is, considered, term, and, is, not, associated, with, the, same, risks, of, a, preterm, birth, planned, birth, before, 39, weeks, by, caesarean, section, or, labor, induction, although, at, term, results, in, an, increased, risk, of, complications, this, is, from, factors, including, underdeveloped, lungs, of, newborns, infection, due, to, underdeveloped, immune, system, feeding, problems, due, to, underdeveloped, brain, and, jaundice, from, underdeveloped, liver, babies, born, between, 39, and, 41, weeks, gestation, have, better, outcomes, than, babies, born, either, before, or, after, this, range, this, special, time, period, is, called, full, term, whenever, possible, waiting, for, labor, to, begin, on, its, own, in, this, time, period, is, best, for, the, health, of, the, mother, and, baby, the, decision, to, perform, an, induction, must, be, made, after, weighing, the, risks, and, benefits, but, is, safer, after, 39, weeks, events, after, 42, weeks, are, considered, postterm, when, a, pregnancy, exceeds, 42, weeks, the, risk, of, complications, for, both, the, woman, and, the, fetus, increases, significantly, therefore, in, an, otherwise, uncomplicated, pregnancy, obstetricians, usually, prefer, to, induce, labor, at, some, stage, between, 41, and, 42, weeks, the, postpartum, period, also, referred, to, as, the, puerperium, is, the, postnatal, period, that, begins, immediately, after, delivery, and, extends, for, about, six, weeks, during, this, period, the, mother, s, body, begins, the, return, to, pre, pregnancy, conditions, that, includes, changes, in, hormone, levels, and, uterus, size, the, beginning, of, pregnancy, may, be, detected, either, based, on, symptoms, by, the, woman, herself, or, by, using, pregnancy, tests, however, an, important, condition, with, serious, health, implications, that, is, quite, common, is, the, denial, of, pregnancy, by, the, pregnant, woman, about, 1, in, 475, denials, will, last, until, around, the, 20th, week, of, pregnancy, the, proportion, of, cases, of, denial, persisting, until, delivery, is, about, 1, in, 2500, conversely, some, non, pregnant, women, have, a, very, strong, belief, that, they, are, pregnant, along, with, some, of, the, physical, changes, this, condition, is, known, as, a, false, pregnancy, most, pregnant, women, experience, a, number, of, symptoms, which, can, signify, pregnancy, a, number, of, early, medical, signs, are, associated, with, pregnancy, these, signs, include, pregnancy, detection, can, be, accomplished, using, one, or, more, various, pregnancy, tests, which, detect, hormones, generated, by, the, newly, formed, placenta, serving, as, biomarkers, of, pregnancy, blood, and, urine, tests, can, detect, pregnancy, by, 11, and, 14, days, respectively, after, fertilization, blood, pregnancy, tests, are, more, sensitive, than, urine, tests, giving, fewer, false, negatives, home, pregnancy, tests, are, urine, tests, and, normally, detect, a, pregnancy, 12, to, 15, days, after, fertilization, a, quantitative, blood, test, can, determine, approximately, the, date, the, embryo, was, fertilized, because, hcg, levels, double, every, 36, to, 72, hours, before, 8, weeks, gestation, a, single, test, of, progesterone, levels, can, also, help, determine, how, likely, a, fetus, will, survive, in, those, with, a, threatened, miscarriage, bleeding, in, early, pregnancy, but, only, if, the, ultrasound, result, was, inconclusive, obstetric, ultrasonography, can, detect, fetal, abnormalities, detect, multiple, pregnancies, and, improve, gestational, dating, at, 24, weeks, the, resultant, estimated, gestational, age, and, due, date, of, the, fetus, are, slightly, more, accurate, than, methods, based, on, last, menstrual, period, ultrasound, is, used, to, measure, the, nuchal, fold, in, order, to, screen, for, down, syndrome, pre, conception, counseling, is, care, that, is, provided, to, a, woman, or, couple, to, discuss, conception, pregnancy, current, health, issues, and, recommendations, for, the, period, before, pregnancy, prenatal, medical, care, is, the, medical, and, nursing, care, recommended, for, women, during, pregnancy, time, intervals, and, exact, goals, of, each, visit, differ, by, country, women, who, are, high, risk, have, better, outcomes, if, they, are, seen, regularly, and, frequently, by, a, medical, professional, than, women, who, are, low, risk, a, woman, can, be, labeled, as, high, risk, for, different, reasons, including, previous, complications, in, pregnancy, complications, in, the, current, pregnancy, current, medical, diseases, or, social, issues, the, aim, of, good, prenatal, care, is, prevention, early, identification, and, treatment, of, any, medical, complications, a, basic, prenatal, visit, consists, of, measurement, of, blood, pressure, fundal, height, weight, and, fetal, heart, rate, checking, for, symptoms, of, labor, and, guidance, for, what, to, expect, next, nutrition, during, pregnancy, is, important, to, ensure, healthy, growth, of, the, fetus, nutrition, during, pregnancy, is, different, from, the, non, pregnant, state, there, are, increased, energy, requirements, and, specific, micronutrient, requirements, women, benefit, from, education, to, encourage, a, balanced, energy, and, protein, intake, during, pregnancy, some, women, may, need, professional, medical, advice, if, their, diet, is, affected, by, medical, conditions, food, allergies, or, specific, religious, ethical, beliefs, further, studies, are, needed, to, access, the, effect, of, dietary, advice, to, prevent, gestational, diabetes, although, low, quality, evidence, suggests, some, benefit, adequate, periconceptional, time, before, and, right, after, conception, folic, acid, also, called, folate, or, vitamin, b, 9, intake, has, been, shown, to, decrease, the, risk, of, fetal, neural, tube, defects, such, as, spina, bifida, the, neural, tube, develops, during, the, first, 28, days, of, pregnancy, a, urine, pregnancy, test, is, not, usually, positive, until, 14, days, post, conception, explaining, the, necessity, to, guarantee, adequate, folate, intake, before, conception, folate, is, abundant, in, green, leafy, vegetables, legumes, and, citrus, in, the, united, states, and, canada, most, wheat, products, flour, noodles, are, fortified, with, folic, acid, the, amount, of, healthy, weight, gain, during, a, pregnancy, varies, weight, gain, is, related, to, the, weight, of, the, baby, the, placenta, extra, circulatory, fluid, larger, tissues, and, fat, and, protein, stores, most, needed, weight, gain, occurs, later, in, pregnancy, the, institute, of, medicine, recommends, an, overall, pregnancy, weight, gain, for, those, of, normal, weight, body, mass, index, of,

obstetric, causes, these, homicides, are, a, combination, of, intimate, partner, violence, and, firearms, health, authorities, have, called, the, violence, a, health, emergency, for, pregnant, women, but, say, that, pregnancy, related, homicides, are, preventable, if, healthcare, providers, identify, those, women, at, risk, and, offer, assistance, to, them, most, women, can, continue, to, engage, in, sexual, activity, including, sexual, intercourse, throughout, pregnancy, research, suggests, that, during, pregnancy, both, sexual, desire, and, frequency, of, sexual, relations, decrease, during, the, first, and, third, trimester, with, a, rise, during, the, second, trimester, sex, during, pregnancy, is, a, low, risk, behavior, except, when, the, healthcare, provider, advises, that, sexual,

no, evidence, of, benefit, and, potential, harm, the, clinical, practice, obstetrics, committee, of, canada, recommends, that, all, women, without, contraindications, should, be, encouraged, to, participate, in, aerobic, and, strength, conditioning, exercises, as, part, of, a, healthy, lifestyle, during, their, pregnancy, although, an, upper, level, of, safe, exercise, intensity, has, not, been, established, women, who, were, regular, exercisers, before, pregnancy, and, who, have, uncomplicated, pregnancies, should, be, able, to, engage, in, high, intensity, exercise, programs, without, a, higher, risk, of, prematurity, lower, birth, weight, or, gestational, weight, gain, in, general, participation, in, a, wide, range, of, recreational, activities, appears, to, be, safe, with, the, avoidance, of, those, with, a, high, risk, of, falling, such, as, horseback, riding, or, skiing, or, those, that, carry, a, risk, of, abdominal, trauma, such, as, soccer, or, hockey, the, american, college, of, obstetricians, and, gynecologists, reports, that, in, the, past, the, main, concerns, of, exercise, in, pregnancy, were, focused, on, the, fetus, and, any, potential, maternal, benefit, was, thought, to, be, offset, by, potential, risks, to, the, fetus, however, they, write, that, more, recent, information, suggests, that, in, the, uncomplicated, pregnancy, fetal, injuries, are, highly, unlikely, they, do, however, list, several, circumstances, when, a, woman, should, contact, her, healthcare, provider, before, continuing, with, an, exercise, program, vaginal, bleeding,

thrombophlebitis, it, has, been, suggested, that, shift, work, and, exposure, to, bright, light, at, night, should, be, avoided, at, least, during, the, last, trimester, of, pregnancy, to, decrease, the, risk, of, psychological, and, behavioral, problems, in, the, newborn, the, children, of, women, who, had, high, stress, levels, during, pregnancy, are, slightly, more, likely, to, have, externalizing, behavioral, problems, such, as, impulsivity, the, behavioral, effect, was, most, pronounced, during, early, childhood, the, increased, levels, of, progesterone, and, estrogen, during,

suggestions, that, severe, periodontitis, may, increase, the, risk, of, having, preterm, birth, and, low, birth, weight, however, a, cochrane, review, found, insufficient, evidence, to, determine, if, periodontitis, can, develop, adverse, birth, outcomes, in, low, risk, pregnancies, most, health, care, providers, approve, flying, until, about, 36, weeks, of, gestational, age, most, airlines, allow, pregnant, women, to, fly, short, distances, at, less, than, 36, weeks, and, long, distances, at, less, than, 32, weeks, many, airlines, require, a, doctor, s, note, that, approves, flying, especially,
