amphetamine, contracted, from, a, lpha, m, ethyl, ph, en, et, hyl, amine, is, a, central, nervous, system, cns, stimulant, that, is, used, in, the, treatment, of, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, narcolepsy, and, obesity, amphetamine, was, discovered, as, a, chemical, in, 1887, by, laz, r, edeleanu, and, then, as, a, drug, in, the, late, 1920s, it, exists, as, two, enantiomers, levoamphetamine, and, dextroamphetamine, amphetamine, properly, refers, to, a, specific, chemical, the, racemic, free, base, which, is, equal, parts, of, the, two, enantiomers, in, their, pure, amine, forms, the, term, is, frequently, used, informally, to, refer, to, any, combination, of, the, enantiomers, or, to, either, of, them, alone, historically, it, has, been, used, to, treat, nasal, congestion, and, depression, amphetamine, is, also, used, as, an, athletic, performance, enhancer, and, cognitive, enhancer, and, recreationally, as, an, aphrodisiac, and, euphoriant, it, is, a, prescription, drug, in, many, countries, and, unauthorized, possession, and, distribution, of, amphetamine, are, often, tightly, controlled, due, to, the, significant, health, risks, associated, with, recreational, use, the, first, amphetamine, pharmaceutical, was, benzedrine, a, brand, which, was, used, to, treat, a, variety, of, conditions, currently, pharmaceutical, amphetamine, is, prescribed, as, racemic, amphetamine, adderall, dextroamphetamine, or, the, inactive, prodrug, lisdexamfetamine, amphetamine, increases, monoamine, and, excitatory, neurotransmission, in, the, brain, with, its, most, pronounced, effects, targeting, the, norepinephrine, and, dopamine, neurotransmitter, systems, at, therapeutic, doses, amphetamine, causes, emotional, and, cognitive, effects, such, as, euphoria, change, in, desire, for, sex, increased, wakefulness, and, improved, cognitive, control, it, induces, physical, effects, such, as, improved, reaction, time, fatigue, resistance, decreased, appetite, elevated, heart, rate, and, increased, muscle, strength, larger, doses, of, amphetamine, may, impair, cognitive, function, and, induce, rapid, muscle, breakdown, addiction, is, a, serious, risk, with, heavy, recreational, amphetamine, use, but, is, unlikely, to, occur, from, long, term, medical, use, at, therapeutic, doses, very, high, doses, can, result, in, psychosis, e, g, hallucinations, delusions, and, paranoia, which, rarely, occurs, at, therapeutic, doses, even, during, long, term, use, recreational, doses, are, generally, much, larger, than, prescribed, therapeutic, doses, and, carry, a, far, greater, risk, of, serious, side, effects, amphetamine, belongs, to, the, phenethylamine, class, it, is, also, the, parent, compound, of, its, own, structural, class, the, substituted, amphetamines, which, includes, prominent, substances, such, as, bupropion, cathinone, mdma, and, methamphetamine, as, a, member, of, the, phenethylamine, class, amphetamine, is, also, chemically, related, to, the, naturally, occurring, trace, amine, neuromodulators, specifically, phenethylamine, and, n, methylphenethylamine, both, of, which, are, produced, within, the, human, body, phenethylamine, is, the, parent, compound, of, amphetamine, while, n, methylphenethylamine, is, a, positional, isomer, of, amphetamine, that, differs, only, in, the, placement, of, the, methyl, group, amphetamine, is, used, to, treat, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, narcolepsy, a, sleep, disorder, and, obesity, and, is, sometimes, prescribed, off, label, for, its, past, medical, indications, particularly, for, depression, and, chronic, pain, long, term, amphetamine, exposure, at, sufficiently, high, doses, in, some, animal, species, is, known, to, produce, abnormal, dopamine, system, development, or, nerve, damage, but, in, humans, with, adhd, long, term, use, of, pharmaceutical, amphetamines, at, therapeutic, doses, appears, to, improve, brain, development, and, nerve, growth, reviews, of, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, studies, suggest, that, long, term, treatment, with, amphetamine, decreases, abnormalities, in, brain, structure, and, function, found, in, subjects, with, adhd, and, improves, function, in, several, parts, of, the, brain, such, as, the, right, caudate, nucleus, of, the, basal, ganglia, reviews, of, clinical, stimulant, research, have, established, the, safety, and, effectiveness, of, long, term, continuous, amphetamine, use, for, the, treatment, of, adhd, randomized, controlled, trials, of, continuous, stimulant, therapy, for, the, treatment, of, adhd, spanning, 2, years, have, demonstrated, treatment, effectiveness, and, safety, two, reviews, have, indicated, that, long, term, continuous, stimulant, therapy, for, adhd, is, effective, for, reducing, the, core, symptoms, of, adhd, i, e, hyperactivity, inattention, and, impulsivity, enhancing, quality, of, life, and, academic, achievement, and, producing, improvements, in, a, large, number, of, functional, outcomes, across, 9, categories, of, outcomes, related, to, academics, antisocial, behavior, driving, non, medicinal, drug, use, obesity, occupation, self, esteem, service, use, i, e, academic, occupational, health, financial, and, legal, services, and, social, function, one, review, highlighted, a, nine, month, randomized, controlled, trial, of, amphetamine, treatment, for, adhd, in, children, that, found, an, average, increase, of, 4, 5, iq, points, continued, increases, in, attention, and, continued, decreases, in, disruptive, behaviors, and, hyperactivity, another, review, indicated, that, based, upon, the, longest, follow, up, studies, conducted, to, date, lifetime, stimulant, therapy, that, begins, during, childhood, is, continuously, effective, for, controlling, adhd, symptoms, and, reduces, the, risk, of, developing, a, substance, use, disorder, as, an, adult, current, models, of, adhd, suggest, that, it, is, associated, with, functional, impairments, in, some, of, the, brain, s, neurotransmitter, systems, these, functional, impairments, involve, impaired, dopamine, neurotransmission, in, the, mesocorticolimbic, projection, and, norepinephrine, neurotransmission, in, the, noradrenergic, projections, from, the, locus, coeruleus, to, the, prefrontal, cortex, psychostimulants, like, methylphenidate, and, amphetamine, are, effective, in, treating, adhd, because, they, increase, neurotransmitter, activity, in, these, systems, approximately, 80, of, those, who, use, these, stimulants, see, improvements, in, adhd, symptoms, children, with, adhd, who, use, stimulant, medications, generally, have, better, relationships, with, peers, and, family, members, perform, better, in, school, are, less, distractible, and, impulsive, and, have, longer, attention, spans, the, cochrane, reviews, on, the, treatment, of, adhd, in, children, adolescents, and, adults, with, pharmaceutical, amphetamines, stated, that, short, term, studies, have, demonstrated, that, these, drugs, decrease, the, severity, of, symptoms, but, they, have, higher, discontinuation, rates, than, non, stimulant, medications, due, to, their, adverse, side, effects, a, cochrane, review, on, the, treatment, of, adhd, in, children, with, tic, disorders, such, as, tourette, syndrome, indicated, that, stimulants, in, general, do, not, make, tics, worse, but, high, doses, of, dextroamphetamine, could, exacerbate, tics, in, some, individuals, narcolepsy, is, a, chronic, sleep, wake, disorder, that, is, associated, with, excessive, daytime, sleepiness, cataplexy, and, sleep, paralysis, patients, with, narcolepsy, are, diagnosed, as, either, type, 1, or, type, 2, with, only, the, former, presenting, cataplexy, symptoms, type, 1, narcolepsy, results, from, the, loss, of, approximately, 70, 000, orexin, releasing, neurons, in, the, lateral, hypothalamus, leading, to, significantly, reduced, cerebrospinal, orexin, levels, this, reduction, is, a, diagnostic, biomarker, for, type, 1, narcolepsy, lateral, hypothalamic, orexin, neurons, innervate, every, component, of, the, ascending, reticular, activating, system, aras, which, includes, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, and, serotonergic, nuclei, that, promote, wakefulness, amphetamine, s, therapeutic, mode, of, action, in, narcolepsy, primarily, involves, increasing, monoamine, neurotransmitter, activity, in, the, aras, this, includes, noradrenergic, neurons, in, the, locus, coeruleus, dopaminergic, neurons, in, the, ventral, tegmental, area, histaminergic, neurons, in, the, tuberomammillary, nucleus, and, serotonergic, neurons, in, the, dorsal, raphe, nucleus, dextroamphetamine, the, more, dopaminergic, enantiomer, of, amphetamine, is, particularly, effective, at, promoting, wakefulness, because, dopamine, release, has, the, greatest, influence, on, cortical, activation, and, cognitive, arousal, relative, to, other, monoamines, in, contrast, levoamphetamine, may, have, a, greater, effect, on, cataplexy, a, symptom, more, sensitive, to, the, effects, of, norepinephrine, and, serotonin, noradrenergic, and, serotonergic, nuclei, in, the, aras, are, involved, in, the, regulation, of, the, rem, sleep, cycle, and, function, as, rem, off, cells, with, amphetamine, s, effect, on, norepinephrine, and, serotonin, contributing, to, the, suppression, of, rem, sleep, and, a, possible, reduction, of, cataplexy, at, high, doses, the, american, academy, of, sleep, medicine, aasm, 2021, clinical, practice, guideline, conditionally, recommends, dextroamphetamine, for, the, treatment, of, both, type, 1, and, type, 2, narcolepsy, treatment, with, pharmaceutical, amphetamines, is, generally, less, preferred, relative, to, other, psychostimulants, e, g, modafinil, and, is, considered, a, third, line, treatment, option, medical, reviews, indicate, that, amphetamine, is, safe, and, effective, for, the, treatment, of, narcolepsy, amphetamine, appears, to, be, most, effective, at, improving, symptoms, associated, with, hypersomnolence, with, three, reviews, finding, clinically, significant, reductions, in, daytime, sleepiness, in, patients, with, narcolepsy, additionally, these, reviews, suggest, that, amphetamine, may, dose, dependently, improve, cataplexy, symptoms, however, the, quality, of, evidence, for, these, findings, is, low, and, is, consequently, reflected, in, the, aasm, s, conditional, recommendation, for, dextroamphetamine, as, a, treatment, option, for, narcolepsy, in, 2015, a, systematic, review, and, a, meta, analysis, of, high, quality, clinical, trials, found, that, when, used, at, low, therapeutic, doses, amphetamine, produces, modest, yet, unambiguous, improvements, in, cognition, including, working, memory, long, term, episodic, memory, inhibitory, control, and, some, aspects, of, attention, in, normal, healthy, adults, these, cognition, enhancing, effects, of, amphetamine, are, known, to, be, partially, mediated, through, the, indirect, activation, of, both, dopamine, receptor, d, 1, and, adrenoceptor, 2, in, the, prefrontal, cortex, a, systematic, review, from, 2014, found, that, low, doses, of, amphetamine, also, improve, memory, consolidation, in, turn, leading, to, improved, recall, of, information, therapeutic, doses, of, amphetamine, also, enhance, cortical, network, efficiency, an, effect, which, mediates, improvements, in, working, memory, in, all, individuals, amphetamine, and, other, adhd, stimulants, also, improve, task, saliency, motivation, to, perform, a, task, and, increase, arousal, wakefulness, in, turn, promoting, goal, directed, behavior, stimulants, such, as, amphetamine, can, improve, performance, on, difficult, and, boring, tasks, and, are, used, by, some, students, as, a, study, and, test, taking, aid, based, upon, studies, of, self, reported, illicit, stimulant, use, 5, 35, of, college, students, use, diverted, adhd, stimulants, which, are, primarily, used, for, enhancement, of, academic, performance, rather, than, as, recreational, drugs, however, high, amphetamine, doses, that, are, above, the, therapeutic, range, can, interfere, with, working, memory, and, other, aspects, of, cognitive, control, amphetamine, is, used, by, some, athletes, for, its, psychological, and, athletic, performance, enhancing, effects, such, as, increased, endurance, and, alertness, however, non, medical, amphetamine, use, is, prohibited, at, sporting, events, that, are, regulated, by, collegiate, national, and, international, anti, doping, agencies, in, healthy, people, at, oral, therapeutic, doses, amphetamine, has, been, shown, to, increase, muscle, strength, acceleration, athletic, performance, in, anaerobic, conditions, and, endurance, i, e, it, delays, the, onset, of, fatigue, while, improving, reaction, time, amphetamine, improves, endurance, and, reaction, time, primarily, through, reuptake, inhibition, and, release, of, dopamine, in, the, central, nervous, system, amphetamine, and, other, dopaminergic, drugs, also, increase, power, output, at, fixed, levels, of, perceived, exertion, by, overriding, a, safety, switch, allowing, the, core, temperature, limit, to, increase, in, order, to, access, a, reserve, capacity, that, is, normally, off, limits, at, therapeutic, doses, the, adverse, effects, of, amphetamine, do, not, impede, athletic, performance, however, at, much, higher, doses, amphetamine, can, induce, effects, that, severely, impair, performance, such, as, rapid, muscle, breakdown, and, elevated, body, temperature, amphetamine, specifically, the, more, dopaminergic, dextrorotatory, enantiomer, dextroamphetamine, is, also, used, recreationally, as, a, euphoriant, and, aphrodisiac, and, like, other, amphetamines, is, used, as, a, club, drug, for, its, energetic, and, euphoric, high, dextroamphetamine, d, amphetamine, is, considered, to, have, a, high, potential, for, misuse, in, a, recreational, manner, since, individuals, typically, report, feeling, euphoric, more, alert, and, more, energetic, after, taking, the, drug, a, notable, part, of, the, 1960s, mod, subculture, in, the, uk, was, recreational, amphetamine, use, which, was, used, to, fuel, all, night, dances, at, clubs, like, manchester, s, twisted, wheel, newspaper, reports, described, dancers, emerging, from, clubs, at, 5, a, m, with, dilated, pupils, mods, used, the, drug, for, stimulation, and, alertness, which, they, viewed, as, different, from, the, intoxication, caused, by, alcohol, and, other, drugs, dr, andrew, wilson, argues, that, for, a, significant, minority, amphetamines, symbolised, the, smart, on, the, ball, cool, image, and, that, they, sought, stimulation, not, intoxication, greater, awareness, not, escape, and, confidence, and, articulacy, rather, than, the, drunken, rowdiness, of, previous, generations, dextroamphetamine, s, dopaminergic, rewarding, properties, affect, the, mesocorticolimbic, circuit, a, group, of, neural, structures, responsible, for, incentive, salience, i, e, wanting, desire, or, craving, for, a, reward, and, motivation, positive, reinforcement, and, positively, valenced, emotions, particularly, ones, involving, pleasure, large, recreational, doses, of, dextroamphetamine, may, produce, symptoms, of, dextroamphetamine, overdose, recreational, users, sometimes, open, dexedrine, capsules, and, crush, the, contents, in, order, to, insufflate, snort, it, or, subsequently, dissolve, it, in, water, and, inject, it, immediate, release, formulations, have, higher, potential, for, abuse, via, insufflation, snorting, or, intravenous, injection, due, to, a, more, favorable, pharmacokinetic, profile, and, easy, crushability, especially, tablets, injection, into, the, bloodstream, can, be, dangerous, because, insoluble, fillers, within, the, tablets, can, block, small, blood, vessels, chronic, overuse, of, dextroamphetamine, can, lead, to, severe, drug, dependence, resulting, in, withdrawal, symptoms, when, drug, use, stops, according, to, the, international, programme, on, chemical, safety, ipcs, and, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, amphetamine, is, contraindicated, in, people, with, a, history, of, drug, abuse, cardiovascular, disease, severe, agitation, or, severe, anxiety, it, is, also, contraindicated, in, individuals, with, advanced, arteriosclerosis, hardening, of, the, arteries, glaucoma, increased, eye, pressure, hyperthyroidism, excessive, production, of, thyroid, hormone, or, moderate, to, severe, hypertension, these, agencies, indicate, that, people, who, have, experienced, allergic, reactions, to, other, stimulants, or, who, are, taking, monoamine, oxidase, inhibitors, maois, should, not, take, amphetamine, although, safe, concurrent, use, of, amphetamine, and, monoamine, oxidase, inhibitors, has, been, documented, these, agencies, also, state, that, anyone, with, anorexia, nervosa, bipolar, disorder, depression, hypertension, liver, or, kidney, problems, mania, psychosis, raynaud, s, phenomenon, seizures, thyroid, problems, tics, or, tourette, syndrome, should, monitor, their, symptoms, while, taking, amphetamine, evidence, from, human, studies, indicates, that, therapeutic, amphetamine, use, does, not, cause, developmental, abnormalities, in, the, fetus, or, newborns, i, e, it, is, not, a, human, teratogen, but, amphetamine, abuse, does, pose, risks, to, the, fetus, amphetamine, has, also, been, shown, to, pass, into, breast, milk, so, the, ipcs, and, the, fda, advise, mothers, to, avoid, breastfeeding, when, using, it, due, to, the, potential, for, reversible, growth, impairments, the, fda, advises, monitoring, the, height, and, weight, of, children, and, adolescents, prescribed, an, amphetamine, pharmaceutical, the, adverse, side, effects, of, amphetamine, are, many, and, varied, and, the, amount, of, amphetamine, used, is, the, primary, factor, in, determining, the, likelihood, and, severity, of, adverse, effects, amphetamine, products, such, as, adderall, dexedrine, and, their, generic, equivalents, are, currently, approved, by, the, u, s, fda, for, long, term, therapeutic, use, recreational, use, of, amphetamine, generally, involves, much, larger, doses, which, have, a, greater, risk, of, serious, adverse, drug, effects, than, dosages, used, for, therapeutic, purposes, cardiovascular, side, effects, can, include, hypertension, or, hypotension, from, a, vasovagal, response, raynaud, s, phenomenon, reduced, blood, flow, to, the, hands, and, feet, and, tachycardia, increased, heart, rate, sexual, side, effects, in, males, may, include, erectile, dysfunction, frequent, erections, or, prolonged, erections, gastrointestinal, side, effects, may, include, abdominal, pain, constipation, diarrhea, and, nausea, other, potential, physical, side, effects, include, appetite, loss, blurred, vision, dry, mouth, excessive, grinding, of, the, teeth, nosebleed, profuse, sweating, rhinitis, medicamentosa, drug, induced, nasal, congestion, reduced, seizure, threshold, tics, a, type, of, movement, disorder, and, weight, loss, dangerous, physical, side, effects, are, rare, at, typical, pharmaceutical, doses, amphetamine, stimulates, the, medullary, respiratory, centers, producing, faster, and, deeper, breaths, in, a, normal, person, at, therapeutic, doses, this, effect, is, usually, not, noticeable, but, when, respiration, is, already, compromised, it, may, be, evident, amphetamine, also, induces, contraction, in, the, urinary, bladder, sphincter, the, muscle, which, controls, urination, which, can, result, in, difficulty, urinating, this, effect, can, be, useful, in, treating, bed, wetting, and, loss, of, bladder, control, the, effects, of, amphetamine, on, the, gastrointestinal, tract, are, unpredictable, if, intestinal, activity, is, high, amphetamine, may, reduce, gastrointestinal, motility, the, rate, at, which, content, moves, through, the, digestive, system, however, amphetamine, may, increase, motility, when, the, smooth, muscle, of, the, tract, is, relaxed, amphetamine, also, has, a, slight, analgesic, effect, and, can, enhance, the, pain, relieving, effects, of, opioids, fda, commissioned, studies, from, 2011, indicate, that, in, children, young, adults, and, adults, there, is, no, association, between, serious, adverse, cardiovascular, events, sudden, death, heart, attack, and, stroke, and, the, medical, use, of, amphetamine, or, other, adhd, stimulants, however, amphetamine, pharmaceuticals, are, contraindicated, in, individuals, with, cardiovascular, disease, at, normal, therapeutic, doses, the, most, common, psychological, side, effects, of, amphetamine, include, increased, alertness, apprehension, concentration, initiative, self, confidence, and, sociability, mood, swings, elated, mood, followed, by, mildly, depressed, mood, insomnia, or, wakefulness, and, decreased, sense, of, fatigue, less, common, side, effects, include, anxiety, change, in, libido, grandiosity, irritability, repetitive, or, obsessive, behaviors, and, restlessness, these, effects, depend, on, the, user, s, personality, and, current, mental, state, amphetamine, psychosis, e, g, delusions, and, paranoia, can, occur, in, heavy, users, although, very, rare, this, psychosis, can, also, occur, at, therapeutic, doses, during, long, term, therapy, according, to, the, fda, there, is, no, systematic, evidence, that, stimulants, produce, aggressive, behavior, or, hostility, amphetamine, has, also, been, shown, to, produce, a, conditioned, place, preference, in, humans, taking, therapeutic, doses, meaning, that, individuals, acquire, a, preference, for, spending, time, in, places, where, they, have, previously, used, amphetamine, addiction, is, a, serious, risk, with, heavy, recreational, amphetamine, use, but, is, unlikely, to, occur, from, long, term, medical, use, at, therapeutic, doses, in, fact, lifetime, stimulant, therapy, for, adhd, that, begins, during, childhood, reduces, the, risk, of, developing, substance, use, disorders, as, an, adult, pathological, overactivation, of, the, mesolimbic, pathway, a, dopamine, pathway, that, connects, the, ventral, tegmental, area, to, the, nucleus, accumbens, plays, a, central, role, in, amphetamine, addiction, individuals, who, frequently, self, administer, high, doses, of, amphetamine, have, a, high, risk, of, developing, an, amphetamine, addiction, since, chronic, use, at, high, doses, gradually, increases, the, level, of, accumbal, fosb, a, molecular, switch, and, master, control, protein, for, addiction, once, nucleus, accumbens, fosb, is, sufficiently, overexpressed, it, begins, to, increase, the, severity, of, addictive, behavior, i, e, compulsive, drug, seeking, with, further, increases, in, its, expression, while, there, are, currently, no, effective, drugs, for, treating, amphetamine, addiction, regularly, engaging, in, sustained, aerobic, exercise, appears, to, reduce, the, risk, of, developing, such, an, addiction, exercise, therapy, improves, clinical, treatment, outcomes, and, may, be, used, as, an, adjunct, therapy, with, behavioral, therapies, for, addiction, chronic, use, of, amphetamine, at, excessive, doses, causes, alterations, in, gene, expression, in, the, mesocorticolimbic, projection, which, arise, through, transcriptional, and, epigenetic, mechanisms, the, most, important, transcription, factors, that, produce, these, alterations, are, delta, fbj, murine, osteosarcoma, viral, oncogene, homolog, b, fosb, camp, response, element, binding, protein, creb, and, nuclear, factor, kappa, b, nf, b, fosb, is, the, most, significant, biomolecular, mechanism, in, addiction, because, fosb, overexpression, i, e, an, abnormally, high, level, of, gene, expression, which, produces, a, pronounced, gene, related, phenotype, in, the, d1, type, medium, spiny, neurons, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, is, necessary, and, sufficient, for, many, of, the, neural, adaptations, and, regulates, multiple, behavioral, effects, e, g, reward, sensitization, and, escalating, drug, self, administration, involved, in, addiction, once, fosb, is, sufficiently, overexpressed, it, induces, an, addictive, state, that, becomes, increasingly, more, severe, with, further, increases, in, fosb, expression, it, has, been, implicated, in, addictions, to, alcohol, cannabinoids, cocaine, methylphenidate, nicotine, opioids, phencyclidine, propofol, and, substituted, amphetamines, among, others, jund, a, transcription, factor, and, g9a, a, histone, methyltransferase, enzyme, both, oppose, the, function, of, fosb, and, inhibit, increases, in, its, expression, sufficiently, overexpressing, jund, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, with, viral, vectors, can, completely, block, many, of, the, neural, and, behavioral, alterations, seen, in, chronic, drug, abuse, i, e, the, alterations, mediated, by, fosb, similarly, accumbal, g9a, hyperexpression, results, in, markedly, increased, histone, 3, lysine, residue, 9, dimethylation, h3k9me2, and, blocks, the, induction, of, fosb, mediated, neural, and, behavioral, plasticity, by, chronic, drug, use, which, occurs, via, h3k9me2, mediated, repression, of, transcription, factors, for, fosb, and, h3k9me2, mediated, repression, of, various, fosb, transcriptional, targets, e, g, cdk5, fosb, also, plays, an, important, role, in, regulating, behavioral, responses, to, natural, rewards, such, as, palatable, food, sex, and, exercise, since, both, natural, rewards, and, addictive, drugs, induce, the, expression, of, fosb, i, e, they, cause, the, brain, to, produce, more, of, it, chronic, acquisition, of, these, rewards, can, result, in, a, similar, pathological, state, of, addiction, consequently, fosb, is, the, most, significant, factor, involved, in, both, amphetamine, addiction, and, amphetamine, induced, sexual, addictions, which, are, compulsive, sexual, behaviors, that, result, from, excessive, sexual, activity, and, amphetamine, use, these, sexual, addictions, are, associated, with, a, dopamine, dysregulation, syndrome, which, occurs, in, some, patients, taking, dopaminergic, drugs, the, effects, of, amphetamine, on, gene, regulation, are, both, dose, and, route, dependent, most, of, the, research, on, gene, regulation, and, addiction, is, based, upon, animal, studies, with, intravenous, amphetamine, administration, at, very, high, doses, the, few, studies, that, have, used, equivalent, weight, adjusted, human, therapeutic, doses, and, oral, administration, show, that, these, changes, if, they, occur, are, relatively, minor, this, suggests, that, medical, use, of, amphetamine, does, not, significantly, affect, gene, regulation, as, of, december, 2019, there, is, no, effective, pharmacotherapy, for, amphetamine, addiction, reviews, from, 2015, and, 2016, indicated, that, taar1, selective, agonists, have, significant, therapeutic, potential, as, a, treatment, for, psychostimulant, addictions, however, as, of, february, 2016, the, only, compounds, which, are, known, to, function, as, taar1, selective, agonists, are, experimental, drugs, amphetamine, addiction, is, largely, mediated, through, increased, activation, of, dopamine, receptors, and, co, localized, nmda, receptors, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, magnesium, ions, inhibit, nmda, receptors, by, blocking, the, receptor, calcium, channel, one, review, suggested, that, based, upon, animal, testing, pathological, addiction, inducing, psychostimulant, use, significantly, reduces, the, level, of, intracellular, magnesium, throughout, the, brain, supplemental, magnesium, treatment, has, been, shown, to, reduce, amphetamine, self, administration, i, e, doses, given, to, oneself, in, humans, but, it, is, not, an, effective, monotherapy, for, amphetamine, addiction, a, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, from, 2019, assessed, the, efficacy, of, 17, different, pharmacotherapies, used, in, randomized, controlled, trials, rcts, for, amphetamine, and, methamphetamine, addiction, it, found, only, low, strength, evidence, that, methylphenidate, might, reduce, amphetamine, or, methamphetamine, self, administration, there, was, low, to, moderate, strength, evidence, of, no, benefit, for, most, of, the, other, medications, used, in, rcts, which, included, antidepressants, bupropion, mirtazapine, sertraline, antipsychotics, aripiprazole, anticonvulsants, topiramate, baclofen, gabapentin, naltrexone, varenicline, citicoline, ondansetron, prometa, riluzole, atomoxetine, dextroamphetamine, and, modafinil, a, 2018, systematic, review, and, network, meta, analysis, of, 50, trials, involving, 12, different, psychosocial, interventions, for, amphetamine, methamphetamine, or, cocaine, addiction, found, that, combination, therapy, with, both, contingency, management, and, community, reinforcement, approach, had, the, highest, efficacy, i, e, abstinence, rate, and, acceptability, i, e, lowest, dropout, rate, other, treatment, modalities, examined, in, the, analysis, included, monotherapy, with, contingency, management, or, community, reinforcement, approach, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, 12, step, programs, non, contingent, reward, based, therapies, psychodynamic, therapy, and, other, combination, therapies, involving, these, additionally, research, on, the, neurobiological, effects, of, physical, exercise, suggests, that, daily, aerobic, exercise, especially, endurance, exercise, e, g, marathon, running, prevents, the, development, of, drug, addiction, and, is, an, effective, adjunct, therapy, i, e, a, supplemental, treatment, for, amphetamine, addiction, exercise, leads, to, better, treatment, outcomes, when, used, as, an, adjunct, treatment, particularly, for, psychostimulant, addictions, in, particular, aerobic, exercise, decreases, psychostimulant, self, administration, reduces, the, reinstatement, i, e, relapse, of, drug, seeking, and, induces, increased, dopamine, receptor, d, 2, drd2, density, in, the, striatum, this, is, the, opposite, of, pathological, stimulant, use, which, induces, decreased, striatal, drd2, density, one, review, noted, that, exercise, may, also, prevent, the, development, of, a, drug, addiction, by, altering, fosb, or, c, fos, immunoreactivity, in, the, striatum, or, other, parts, of, the, reward, system, drug, tolerance, develops, rapidly, in, amphetamine, abuse, i, e, recreational, amphetamine, use, so, periods, of, extended, abuse, require, increasingly, larger, doses, of, the, drug, in, order, to, achieve, the, same, effect, according, to, a, cochrane, review, on, withdrawal, in, individuals, who, compulsively, use, amphetamine, and, methamphetamine, when, chronic, heavy, users, abruptly, discontinue, amphetamine, use, many, report, a, time, limited, withdrawal, syndrome, that, occurs, within, 24, hours, of, their, last, dose, this, review, noted, that, withdrawal, symptoms, in, chronic, high, dose, users, are, frequent, occurring, in, roughly, 88, of, cases, and, persist, for, 3, 4, weeks, with, a, marked, crash, phase, occurring, during, the, first, week, amphetamine, withdrawal, symptoms, can, include, anxiety, drug, craving, depressed, mood, fatigue, increased, appetite, increased, movement, or, decreased, movement, lack, of, motivation, sleeplessness, or, sleepiness, and, lucid, dreams, the, review, indicated, that, the, severity, of, withdrawal, symptoms, is, positively, correlated, with, the, age, of, the, individual, and, the, extent, of, their, dependence, mild, withdrawal, symptoms, from, the, discontinuation, of, amphetamine, treatment, at, therapeutic, doses, can, be, avoided, by, tapering, the, dose, an, amphetamine, overdose, can, lead, to, many, different, symptoms, but, is, rarely, fatal, with, appropriate, care, the, severity, of, overdose, symptoms, increases, with, dosage, and, decreases, with, drug, tolerance, to, amphetamine, tolerant, individuals, have, been, known, to, take, as, much, as, 5, grams, of, amphetamine, in, a, day, which, is, roughly, 100, times, the, maximum, daily, therapeutic, dose, symptoms, of, a, moderate, and, extremely, large, overdose, are, listed, below, fatal, amphetamine, poisoning, usually, also, involves, convulsions, and, coma, in, 2013, overdose, on, amphetamine, methamphetamine, and, other, compounds, implicated, in, an, amphetamine, use, disorder, resulted, in, an, estimated, 3, 788, deaths, worldwide, 3, 425, 4, 145, deaths, 95, confidence, in, rodents, and, primates, sufficiently, high, doses, of, amphetamine, cause, dopaminergic, neurotoxicity, or, damage, to, dopamine, neurons, which, is, characterized, by, dopamine, terminal, degeneration, and, reduced, transporter, and, receptor, function, there, is, no, evidence, that, amphetamine, is, directly, neurotoxic, in, humans, however, large, doses, of, amphetamine, may, indirectly, cause, dopaminergic, neurotoxicity, as, a, result, of, hyperpyrexia, the, excessive, formation, of, reactive, oxygen, species, and, increased, autoxidation, of, dopamine, animal, models, of, neurotoxicity, from, high, dose, amphetamine, exposure, indicate, that, the, occurrence, of, hyperpyrexia, i, e, core, body, temperature, 40, c, is, necessary, for, the, development, of, amphetamine, induced, neurotoxicity, prolonged, elevations, of, brain, temperature, above, 40, c, likely, promote, the, development, of, amphetamine, induced, neurotoxicity, in, laboratory, animals, by, facilitating, the, production, of, reactive, oxygen, species, disrupting, cellular, protein, function, and, transiently, increasing, blood, brain, barrier, permeability, an, amphetamine, overdose, can, result, in, a, stimulant, psychosis, that, may, involve, a, variety, of, symptoms, such, as, delusions, and, paranoia, a, cochrane, review, on, treatment, for, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and, methamphetamine, psychosis, states, that, about, 5, 15, of, users, fail, to, recover, completely, according, to, the, same, review, there, is, at, least, one, trial, that, shows, antipsychotic, medications, effectively, resolve, the, symptoms, of, acute, amphetamine, psychosis, psychosis, rarely, arises, from, therapeutic, use, many, types, of, substances, are, known, to, interact, with, amphetamine, resulting, in, altered, drug, action, or, metabolism, of, amphetamine, the, interacting, substance, or, both, inhibitors, of, enzymes, that, metabolize, amphetamine, e, g, cyp2d6, and, fmo3, will, prolong, its, elimination, half, life, meaning, that, its, effects, will, last, longer, amphetamine, also, interacts, with, maois, particularly, monoamine, oxidase, a, inhibitors, since, both, maois, and, amphetamine, increase, plasma, catecholamines, i, e, norepinephrine, and, dopamine, therefore, concurrent, use, of, both, is, dangerous, amphetamine, modulates, the, activity, of, most, psychoactive, drugs, in, particular, amphetamine, may, decrease, the, effects, of, sedatives, and, depressants, and, increase, the, effects, of, stimulants, and, antidepressants, amphetamine, may, also, decrease, the, effects, of, antihypertensives, and, antipsychotics, due, to, its, effects, on, blood, pressure, and, dopamine, respectively, zinc, supplementation, may, reduce, the, minimum, effective, dose, of, amphetamine, when, it, is, used, for, the, treatment, of, adhd, in, general, there, is, no, significant, interaction, when, consuming, amphetamine, with, food, but, the, ph, of, gastrointestinal, content, and, urine, affects, the, absorption, and, excretion, of, amphetamine, respectively, acidic, substances, reduce, the, absorption, of, amphetamine, and, increase, urinary, excretion, and, alkaline, substances, do, the, opposite, due, to, the, effect, ph, has, on, absorption, amphetamine, also, interacts, with, gastric, acid, reducers, such, as, proton, pump, inhibitors, and, h, 2, antihistamines, which, increase, gastrointestinal, ph, i, e, make, it, less, acidic, amphetamine, exerts, its, behavioral, effects, by, altering, the, use, of, monoamines, as, neuronal, signals, in, the, brain, primarily, in, catecholamine, neurons, in, the, reward, and, executive, function, pathways, of, the, brain, the, concentrations, of, the, main, neurotransmitters, involved, in, reward, circuitry, and, executive, functioning, dopamine, and, norepinephrine, increase, dramatically, in, a, dose, dependent, manner, by, amphetamine, because, of, its, effects, on, monoamine, transporters, the, reinforcing, and, motivational, salience, promoting, effects, of, amphetamine, are, due, mostly, to, enhanced, dopaminergic, activity, in, the, mesolimbic, pathway, the, euphoric, and, locomotor, stimulating, effects, of, amphetamine, are, dependent, upon, the, magnitude, and, speed, by, which, it, increases, synaptic, dopamine, and, norepinephrine, concentrations, in, the, striatum, amphetamine, has, been, identified, as, a, potent, full, agonist, of, trace, amine, associated, receptor, 1, taar1, a, g, s, coupled, and, g, q, coupled, g, protein, coupled, receptor, gpcr, discovered, in, 2001, which, is, important, for, regulation, of, brain, monoamines, activation, of, taar1, increases, camp, tooltip, cyclic, adenosine, monophosphate, production, via, adenylyl, cyclase, activation, and, inhibits, monoamine, transporter, function, monoamine, autoreceptors, e, g, d, 2, short, presynaptic, 2, and, presynaptic, 5, ht, 1a, have, the, opposite, effect, of, taar1, and, together, these, receptors, provide, a, regulatory, system, for, monoamines, notably, amphetamine, and, trace, amines, possess, high, binding, affinities, for, taar1, but, not, for, monoamine, autoreceptors, imaging, studies, indicate, that, monoamine, reuptake, inhibition, by, amphetamine, and, trace, amines, is, site, specific, and, depends, upon, the, presence, of, taar1, co, localization, in, the, associated, monoamine, neurons, in, addition, to, the, neuronal, monoamine, transporters, amphetamine, also, inhibits, both, vesicular, monoamine, transporters, vmat1, and, vmat2, as, well, as, slc1a1, slc22a3, and, slc22a5, slc1a1, is, excitatory, amino, acid, transporter, 3, eaat3, a, glutamate, transporter, located, in, neurons, slc22a3, is, an, extraneuronal, monoamine, transporter, that, is, present, in, astrocytes, and, slc22a5, is, a, high, affinity, carnitine, transporter, amphetamine, is, known, to, strongly, induce, cocaine, and, amphetamine, regulated, transcript, cart, gene, expression, a, neuropeptide, involved, in, feeding, behavior, stress, and, reward, which, induces, observable, increases, in, neuronal, development, and, survival, in, vitro, the, cart, receptor, has, yet, to, be, identified, but, there, is, significant, evidence, that, cart, binds, to, a, unique, g, i, g, o, coupled, gpcr, amphetamine, also, inhibits, monoamine, oxidases, at, very, high, doses, resulting, in, less, monoamine, and, trace, amine, metabolism, and, consequently, higher, concentrations, of, synaptic, monoamines, in, humans, the, only, post, synaptic, receptor, at, which, amphetamine, is, known, to, bind, is, the, 5, ht1a, receptor, where, it, acts, as, an, agonist, with, low, micromolar, affinity, the, full, profile, of, amphetamine, s, short, term, drug, effects, in, humans, is, mostly, derived, through, increased, cellular, communication, or, neurotransmission, of, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, histamine, cart, peptides, endogenous, opioids, adrenocorticotropic, hormone, corticosteroids, and, glutamate, which, it, affects, through, interactions, with, cart, 5, ht1a, eaat3, taar1, vmat1, vmat2, and, possibly, other, biological, targets, amphetamine, also, activates, seven, human, carbonic, anhydrase, enzymes, several, of, which, are, expressed, in, the, human, brain, dextroamphetamine, is, a, more, potent, agonist, of, taar1, than, levoamphetamine, consequently, dextroamphetamine, produces, greater, cns, stimulation, than, levoamphetamine, roughly, three, to, four, times, more, but, levoamphetamine, has, slightly, stronger, cardiovascular, and, peripheral, effects, in, certain, brain, regions, amphetamine, increases, the, concentration, of, dopamine, in, the, synaptic, cleft, amphetamine, can, enter, the, presynaptic, neuron, either, through, dat, or, by, diffusing, across, the, neuronal, membrane, directly, as, a, consequence, of, dat, uptake, amphetamine, produces, competitive, reuptake, inhibition, at, the, transporter, upon, entering, the, presynaptic, neuron, amphetamine, activates, taar1, which, through, protein, kinase, a, pka, and, protein, kinase, c, pkc, signaling, causes, dat, phosphorylation, phosphorylation, by, either, protein, kinase, can, result, in, dat, internalization, non, competitive, reuptake, inhibition, but, pkc, mediated, phosphorylation, alone, induces, the, reversal, of, dopamine, transport, through, dat, i, e, dopamine, efflux, amphetamine, is, also, known, to, increase, intracellular, calcium, an, effect, which, is, associated, with, dat, phosphorylation, through, an, unidentified, ca2, calmodulin, dependent, protein, kinase, camk, dependent, pathway, in, turn, producing, dopamine, efflux, through, direct, activation, of, g, protein, coupled, inwardly, rectifying, potassium, channels, taar1, reduces, the, firing, rate, of, dopamine, neurons, preventing, a, hyper, dopaminergic, state, amphetamine, is, also, a, substrate, for, the, presynaptic, vesicular, monoamine, transporter, vmat2, following, amphetamine, uptake, at, vmat2, amphetamine, induces, the, collapse, of, the, vesicular, ph, gradient, which, results, in, the, release, of, dopamine, molecules, from, synaptic, vesicles, into, the, cytosol, via, dopamine, efflux, through, vmat2, subsequently, the, cytosolic, dopamine, molecules, are, released, from, the, presynaptic, neuron, into, the, synaptic, cleft, via, reverse, transport, at, dat, similar, to, dopamine, amphetamine, dose, dependently, increases, the, level, of, synaptic, norepinephrine, the, direct, precursor, of, epinephrine, based, upon, neuronal, taar1, mrna, expression, amphetamine, is, thought, to, affect, norepinephrine, analogously, to, dopamine, in, other, words, amphetamine, induces, taar1, mediated, efflux, and, non, competitive, reuptake, inhibition, at, phosphorylated, net, competitive, net, reuptake, inhibition, and, norepinephrine, release, from, vmat2, amphetamine, exerts, analogous, yet, less, pronounced, effects, on, serotonin, as, on, dopamine, and, norepinephrine, amphetamine, affects, serotonin, via, vmat2, and, like, norepinephrine, is, thought, to, phosphorylate, sert, via, taar1, like, dopamine, amphetamine, has, low, micromolar, affinity, at, the, human, 5, ht1a, receptor, acute, amphetamine, administration, in, humans, increases, endogenous, opioid, release, in, several, brain, structures, in, the, reward, system, extracellular, levels, of, glutamate, the, primary, excitatory, neurotransmitter, in, the, brain, have, been, shown, to, increase, in, the, striatum, following, exposure, to, amphetamine, this, increase, in, extracellular, glutamate, presumably, occurs, via, the, amphetamine, induced, internalization, of, eaat3, a, glutamate, reuptake, transporter, in, dopamine, neurons, amphetamine, also, induces, the, selective, release, of, histamine, from, mast, cells, and, efflux, from, histaminergic, neurons, through, vmat2, acute, amphetamine, administration, can, also, increase, adrenocorticotropic, hormone, and, corticosteroid, levels, in, blood, plasma, by, stimulating, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, in, december, 2017, the, first, study, assessing, the, interaction, between, amphetamine, and, human, carbonic, anhydrase, enzymes, was, published, of, the, eleven, carbonic, anhydrase, enzymes, it, examined, it, found, that, amphetamine, potently, activates, seven, four, of, which, are, highly, expressed, in, the, human, brain, with, low, nanomolar, through, low, micromolar, activating, effects, based, upon, preclinical, research, cerebral, carbonic, anhydrase, activation, has, cognition, enhancing, effects, but, based, upon, the, clinical, use, of, carbonic, anhydrase, inhibitors, carbonic, anhydrase, activation, in, other, tissues, may, be, associated, with, adverse, effects, such, as, ocular, activation, exacerbating, glaucoma, the, oral, bioavailability, of, amphetamine, varies, with, gastrointestinal, ph, it, is, well, absorbed, from, the, gut, and, bioavailability, is, typically, 90, amphetamine, is, a, weak, base, with, a, p, k, a, of, 9, 9, consequently, when, the, ph, is, basic, more, of, the, drug, is, in, its, lipid, soluble, free, base, form, and, more, is, absorbed, through, the, lipid, rich, cell, membranes, of, the, gut, epithelium, conversely, an, acidic, ph, means, the, drug, is, predominantly, in, a, water, soluble, cationic, salt, form, and, less, is, absorbed, approximately, 20, of, amphetamine, circulating, in, the, bloodstream, is, bound, to, plasma, proteins, following, absorption, amphetamine, readily, distributes, into, most, tissues, in, the, body, with, high, concentrations, occurring, in, cerebrospinal, fluid, and, brain, tissue, the, half, lives, of, amphetamine, enantiomers, differ, and, vary, with, urine, ph, at, normal, urine, ph, the, half, lives, of, dextroamphetamine, and, levoamphetamine, are, 9, 11, hours, and, 11, 14, hours, respectively, highly, acidic, urine, will, reduce, the, enantiomer, half, lives, to, 7, hours, highly, alkaline, urine, will, increase, the, half, lives, up, to, 34, hours, the, immediate, release, and, extended, release, variants, of, salts, of, both, isomers, reach, peak, plasma, concentrations, at, 3, hours, and, 7, hours, post, dose, respectively, amphetamine, is, eliminated, via, the, kidneys, with, 30, 40, of, the, drug, being, excreted, unchanged, at, normal, urinary, ph, when, the, urinary, ph, is, basic, amphetamine, is, in, its, free, base, form, so, less, is, excreted, when, urine, ph, is, abnormal, the, urinary, recovery, of, amphetamine, may, range, from, a, low, of, 1, to, a, high, of, 75, depending, mostly, upon, whether, urine, is, too, basic, or, acidic, respectively, following, oral, administration, amphetamine, appears, in, urine, within, 3, hours, roughly, 90, of, ingested, amphetamine, is, eliminated, 3, days, after, the, last, oral, dose, lisdexamfetamine, is, a, prodrug, of, dextroamphetamine, it, is, not, as, sensitive, to, ph, as, amphetamine, when, being, absorbed, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, following, absorption, into, the, blood, stream, lisdexamfetamine, is, completely, converted, by, red, blood, cells, to, dextroamphetamine, and, the, amino, acid, l, lysine, by, hydrolysis, via, undetermined, aminopeptidase, enzymes, this, is, the, rate, limiting, step, in, the, bioactivation, of, lisdexamfetamine, the, elimination, half, life, of, lisdexamfetamine, is, generally, less, than, 1, hour, due, to, the, necessary, conversion, of, lisdexamfetamine, into, dextroamphetamine, levels, of, dextroamphetamine, with, lisdexamfetamine, peak, about, one, hour, later, than, with, an, equivalent, dose, of, immediate, release, dextroamphetamine, presumably, due, to, its, rate, limited, activation, by, red, blood, cells, intravenous, administration, of, lisdexamfetamine, shows, greatly, delayed, time, to, peak, and, reduced, peak, levels, compared, to, intravenous, administration, of, an, equivalent, dose, of, dextroamphetamine, the, pharmacokinetics, of, lisdexamfetamine, are, similar, regardless, of, whether, it, is, administered, orally, intranasally, or, intravenously, hence, in, contrast, to, dextroamphetamine, parenteral, use, does, not, enhance, the, subjective, effects, of, lisdexamfetamine, because, of, its, behavior, as, a, prodrug, and, its, pharmacokinetic, differences, lisdexamfetamine, has, a, longer, duration, of, therapeutic, effect, than, immediate, release, dextroamphetamine, and, shows, reduced, misuse, potential, cyp2d6, dopamine, hydroxylase, dbh, flavin, containing, monooxygenase, 3, fmo3, butyrate, coa, ligase, xm, ligase, and, glycine, n, acyltransferase, glyat, are, the, enzymes, known, to, metabolize, amphetamine, or, its, metabolites, in, humans, amphetamine, has, a, variety, of, excreted, metabolic, products, including, 4, hydroxyamphetamine, 4, hydroxynorephedrine, 4, hydroxyphenylacetone, benzoic, acid, hippuric, acid, norephedrine, and, phenylacetone, among, these, metabolites, the, active, sympathomimetics, are, 4, hydroxyamphetamine, 4, hydroxynorephedrine, and, norephedrine, the, main, metabolic, pathways, involve, aromatic, para, hydroxylation, aliphatic, alpha, and, beta, hydroxylation, n, oxidation, n, dealkylation, and, deamination, the, known, metabolic, pathways, detectable, metabolites, and, metabolizing, enzymes, in, humans, include, the, following, the, human, metagenome, i, e, the, genetic, composition, of, an, individual, and, all, microorganisms, that, reside, on, or, within, the, individual, s, body, varies, considerably, between, individuals, since, the, total, number, of, microbial, and, viral, cells, in, the, human, body, over, 100, trillion, greatly, outnumbers, human, cells, tens, of, trillions, there, is, considerable, potential, for, interactions, between, drugs, and, an, individual, s, microbiome, including, drugs, altering, the, composition, of, the, human, microbiome, drug, metabolism, by, microbial, enzymes, modifying, the, drug, s, pharmacokinetic, profile, and, microbial, drug, metabolism, affecting, a, drug, s, clinical, efficacy, and, toxicity, profile, the, field, that, studies, these, interactions, is, known, as, pharmacomicrobiomics, similar, to, most, biomolecules, and, other, orally, administered, xenobiotics, i, e, drugs, amphetamine, is, predicted, to, undergo, promiscuous, metabolism, by, human, gastrointestinal, microbiota, primarily, bacteria, prior, to, absorption, into, the, blood, stream, the, first, amphetamine, metabolizing, microbial, enzyme, tyramine, oxidase, from, a, strain, of, e, coli, commonly, found, in, the, human, gut, was, identified, in, 2019, this, enzyme, was, found, to, metabolize, amphetamine, tyramine, and, phenethylamine, with, roughly, the, same, binding, affinity, for, all, three, compounds, amphetamine, has, a, very, similar, structure, and, function, to, the, endogenous, trace, amines, which, are, naturally, occurring, neuromodulator, molecules, produced, in, the, human, body, and, brain, among, this, group, the, most, closely, related, compounds, are, phenethylamine, the, parent, compound, of, amphetamine, and, n, methylphenethylamine, a, structural, isomer, of, amphetamine, i, e, it, has, an, identical, molecular, formula, in, humans, phenethylamine, is, produced, directly, from, l, phenylalanine, by, the, aromatic, amino, acid, decarboxylase, aadc, enzyme, which, converts, l, dopa, into, dopamine, as, well, in, turn, n, methylphenethylamine, is, metabolized, from, phenethylamine, by, phenylethanolamine, n, methyltransferase, the, same, enzyme, that, metabolizes, norepinephrine, into, epinephrine, like, amphetamine, both, phenethylamine, and, n, methylphenethylamine, regulate, monoamine, neurotransmission, via, taar1, unlike, amphetamine, both, of, these, substances, are, broken, down, by, monoamine, oxidase, b, and, therefore, have, a, shorter, half, life, than, amphetamine, amphetamine, is, a, methyl, homolog, of, the, mammalian, neurotransmitter, phenethylamine, with, the, chemical, formula, c, 9, h, 13, n, the, carbon, atom, adjacent, to, the, primary, amine, is, a, stereogenic, center, and, amphetamine, is, composed, of, a, racemic, 1, 1, mixture, of, two, enantiomers, this, racemic, mixture, can, be, separated, into, its, optical, isomers, levoamphetamine, and, dextroamphetamine, at, room, temperature, the, pure, free, base, of, amphetamine, is, a, mobile, colorless, and, volatile, liquid, with, a, characteristically, strong, amine, odor, and, acrid, burning, taste, frequently, prepared, solid, salts, of, amphetamine, include, amphetamine, adipate, aspartate, hydrochloride, phosphate, saccharate, sulfate, and, tannate, dextroamphetamine, sulfate, is, the, most, common, enantiopure, salt, amphetamine, is, also, the, parent, compound, of, its, own, structural, class, which, includes, a, number, of, psychoactive, derivatives, in, organic, chemistry, amphetamine, is, an, excellent, chiral, ligand, for, the, stereoselective, synthesis, of, 1, 1, bi, 2, naphthol, the, substituted, derivatives, of, amphetamine, or, substituted, amphetamines, are, a, broad, range, of, chemicals, that, contain, amphetamine, as, a, backbone, specifically, this, chemical, class, includes, derivative, compounds, that, are, formed, by, replacing, one, or, more, hydrogen, atoms, in, the, amphetamine, core, structure, with, substituents, the, class, includes, amphetamine, itself, stimulants, like, methamphetamine, serotonergic, empathogens, like, mdma, and, decongestants, like, ephedrine, among, other, subgroups, since, the, first, preparation, was, reported, in, 1887, numerous, synthetic, routes, to, amphetamine, have, been, developed, the, most, common, route, of, both, legal, and, illicit, amphetamine, synthesis, employs, a, non, metal, reduction, known, as, the, leuckart, reaction, method, 1, in, the, first, step, a, reaction, between, phenylacetone, and, formamide, either, using, additional, formic, acid, or, formamide, itself, as, a, reducing, agent, yields, n, formylamphetamine, this, intermediate, is, then, hydrolyzed, using, hydrochloric, acid, and, subsequently, basified, extracted, with, organic, solvent, concentrated, and, distilled, to, yield, the, free, base, the, free, base, is, then, dissolved, in, an, organic, solvent, sulfuric, acid, added, and, amphetamine, precipitates, out, as, the, sulfate, salt, a, number, of, chiral, resolutions, have, been, developed, to, separate, the, two, enantiomers, of, amphetamine, for, example, racemic, amphetamine, can, be, treated, with, d, tartaric, acid, to, form, a, diastereoisomeric, salt, which, is, fractionally, crystallized, to, yield, dextroamphetamine, chiral, resolution, remains, the, most, economical, method, for, obtaining, optically, pure, amphetamine, on, a, large, scale, in, addition, several, enantioselective, syntheses, of, amphetamine, have, been, developed, in, one, example, optically, pure, r, 1, phenyl, ethanamine, is, condensed, with, phenylacetone, to, yield, a, chiral, schiff, base, in, the, key, step, this, intermediate, is, reduced, by, catalytic, hydrogenation, with, a, transfer, of, chirality, to, the, carbon, atom, alpha, to, the, amino, group, cleavage, of, the, benzylic, amine, bond, by, hydrogenation, yields, optically, pure, dextroamphetamine, a, large, number, of, alternative, synthetic, routes, to, amphetamine, have, been, developed, based, on, classic, organic, reactions, one, example, is, the, friedel, crafts, alkylation, of, benzene, by, allyl, chloride, to, yield, beta, chloropropylbenzene, which, is, then, reacted, with, ammonia, to, produce, racemic, amphetamine, method, 2, another, example, employs, the, ritter, reaction, method, 3, in, this, route, allylbenzene, is, reacted, acetonitrile, in, sulfuric, acid, to, yield, an, organosulfate, which, in, turn, is, treated, with, sodium, hydroxide, to, give, amphetamine, via, an, acetamide, intermediate, a, third, route, starts, with, ethyl, 3, oxobutanoate, which, through, a, double, alkylation, with, methyl, iodide, followed, by, benzyl, chloride, can, be, converted, into, 2, methyl, 3, phenyl, propanoic, acid, this, synthetic, intermediate, can, be, transformed, into, amphetamine, using, either, a, hofmann, or, curtius, rearrangement, method, 4, a, significant, number, of, amphetamine, syntheses, feature, a, reduction, of, a, nitro, imine, oxime, or, other, nitrogen, containing, functional, groups, in, one, such, example, a, knoevenagel, condensation, of, benzaldehyde, with, nitroethane, yields, phenyl, 2, nitropropene, the, double, bond, and, nitro, group, of, this, intermediate, is, reduced, using, either, catalytic, hydrogenation, or, by, treatment, with, lithium, aluminium, hydride, method, 5, another, method, is, the, reaction, of, phenylacetone, with, ammonia, producing, an, imine, intermediate, that, is, reduced, to, the, primary, amine, using, hydrogen, over, a, palladium, catalyst, or, lithium, aluminum, hydride, method, 6, amphetamine, is, frequently, measured, in, urine, or, blood, as, part, of, a, drug, test, for, sports, employment, poisoning, diagnostics, and, forensics, techniques, such, as, immunoassay, which, is, the, most, common, form, of, amphetamine, test, may, cross, react, with, a, number, of, sympathomimetic, drugs, chromatographic, methods, specific, for, amphetamine, are, employed, to, prevent, false, positive, results, chiral, separation, techniques, may, be, employed, to, help, distinguish, the, source, of, the, drug, whether, prescription, amphetamine, prescription, amphetamine, prodrugs, e, g, selegiline, over, the, counter, drug, products, that, contain, levomethamphetamine, or, illicitly, obtained, substituted, amphetamines, several, prescription, drugs, produce, amphetamine, as, a, metabolite, including, benzphetamine, clobenzorex, famprofazone, fenproporex, lisdexamfetamine, mesocarb, methamphetamine, prenylamine, and, selegiline, among, others, these, compounds, may, produce, positive, results, for, amphetamine, on, drug, tests, amphetamine, is, generally, only, detectable, by, a, standard, drug, test, for, approximately, 24, hours, although, a, high, dose, may, be, detectable, for, 2, 4, days, for, the, assays, a, study, noted, that, an, enzyme, multiplied, immunoassay, technique, emit, assay, for, amphetamine, and, methamphetamine, may, produce, more, false, positives, than, liquid, chromatography, tandem, mass, spectrometry, gas, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, gc, ms, of, amphetamine, and, methamphetamine, with, the, derivatizing, agent, s, trifluoroacetylprolyl, chloride, allows, for, the, detection, of, methamphetamine, in, urine, gc, ms, of, amphetamine, and, methamphetamine, with, the, chiral, derivatizing, agent, mosher, s, acid, chloride, allows, for, the, detection, of, both, dextroamphetamine, and, dextromethamphetamine, in, urine, hence, the, latter, method, may, be, used, on, samples, that, test, positive, using, other, methods, to, help, distinguish, between, the, various, sources, of, the, drug, amphetamine, was, first, synthesized, in, 1887, in, germany, by, romanian, chemist, laz, r, edeleanu, who, named, it, phenylisopropylamine, its, stimulant, effects, remained, unknown, until, 1927, when, it, was, independently, resynthesized, by, gordon, alles, and, reported, to, have, sympathomimetic, properties, amphetamine, had, no, medical, use, until, late, 1933, when, smith, kline, and, french, began, selling, it, as, an, inhaler, under, the, brand, name, benzedrine, as, a, decongestant, benzedrine, sulfate, was, introduced, 3, years, later, and, was, used, to, treat, a, wide, variety, of, medical, conditions, including, narcolepsy, obesity, low, blood, pressure, low, libido, and, chronic, pain, among, others, during, world, war, ii, amphetamine, and, methamphetamine, were, used, extensively, by, both, the, allied, and, axis, forces, for, their, stimulant, and, performance, enhancing, effects, as, the, addictive, properties, of, the, drug, became, known, governments, began, to, place, strict, controls, on, the, sale, of, amphetamine, for, example, during, the, early, 1970s, in, the, united, states, amphetamine, became, a, schedule, ii, controlled, substance, under, the, controlled, substances, act, in, spite, of, strict, government, controls, amphetamine, has, been, used, legally, or, illicitly, by, people, from, a, variety, of, backgrounds, including, authors, musicians, mathematicians, and, athletes, amphetamine, is, still, illegally, synthesized, today, in, clandestine, labs, and, sold, on, the, black, market, primarily, in, european, countries, among, european, union, eu, member, states, in, 2018, 11, 9, million, adults, of, ages, 15, 64, have, used, amphetamine, or, methamphetamine, at, least, once, in, their, lives, and, 1, 7, million, have, used, either, in, the, last, year, during, 2012, approximately, 5, 9, metric, tons, of, illicit, amphetamine, were, seized, within, eu, member, states, the, street, price, of, illicit, amphetamine, within, the, eu, ranged, from, 6, 38, per, gram, during, the, same, period, outside, europe, the, illicit, market, for, amphetamine, is, much, smaller, than, the, market, for, methamphetamine, and, mdma, as, a, result, of, the, united, nations, 1971, convention, on, psychotropic, substances, amphetamine, became, a, schedule, ii, controlled, substance, as, defined, in, the, treaty, in, all, 183, state, parties, consequently, it, is, heavily, regulated, in, most, countries, some, countries, such, as, south, korea, and, japan, have, banned, substituted, amphetamines, even, for, medical, use, in, other, nations, such, as, canada, schedule, i, drug, the, netherlands, list, i, drug, the, united, states, schedule, ii, drug, australia, schedule, 8, thailand, category, 1, narcotic, and, united, kingdom, class, b, drug, amphetamine, is, in, a, restrictive, national, drug, schedule, that, allows, for, its, use, as, a, medical, treatment, several, currently, marketed, amphetamine, formulations, contain, both, enantiomers, including, those, marketed, under, the, brand, names, adderall, adderall, xr, mydayis, adzenys, er, adzenys, xr, odt, dyanavel, xr, evekeo, and, evekeo, odt, of, those, evekeo, including, evekeo, odt, is, the, only, product, containing, only, racemic, amphetamine, as, amphetamine, sulfate, and, is, therefore, the, only, one, whose, active, moiety, can, be, accurately, referred, to, simply, as, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, marketed, under, the, brand, names, dexedrine, and, zenzedi, is, the, only, enantiopure, amphetamine, product, currently, available, a, prodrug, form, of, dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, is, also, available, and, is, marketed, under, the, brand, name, vyvanse, as, it, is, a, prodrug, lisdexamfetamine, is, structurally, different, from, dextroamphetamine, and, is, inactive, until, it, metabolizes, into, dextroamphetamine, the, free, base, of, racemic, amphetamine, was, previously, available, as, benzedrine, psychedrine, and, sympatedrine, levoamphetamine, was, previously, available, as, cydril, many, current, amphetamine, pharmaceuticals, are, salts, due, to, the, comparatively, high, volatility, of, the, free, base, however, oral, suspension, and, orally, disintegrating, tablet, odt, dosage, forms, composed, of, the, free, base, were, introduced, in, 2015, and, 2016, respectively, some, of, the, current, brands, and, their, generic, equivalents, are, listed, below, stimulants, phenylethanolamine
