the, red, eared, slider, or, red, eared, terrapin, trachemys, scripta, elegans, is, a, subspecies, of, the, pond, slider, trachemys, scripta, a, semiaquatic, turtle, belonging, to, the, family, emydidae, it, is, the, most, popular, pet, turtle, in, the, united, states, is, also, popular, as, a, pet, across, the, rest, of, the, world, and, is, the, most, invasive, turtle, it, is, the, most, commonly, traded, turtle, in, the, world, the, red, eared, slider, is, native, from, the, midwestern, united, states, to, northern, mexico, but, has, become, established, in, other, places, because, of, pet, releases, and, has, become, invasive, in, many, areas, where, it, outcompetes, native, species, the, red, eared, slider, is, included, in, the, list, of, the, world, s, 100, most, invasive, species, the, red, eared, slider, gets, its, name, from, the, small, red, stripe, around, its, ears, or, where, its, ears, would, be, and, from, its, ability, to, slide, quickly, off, rocks, and, logs, into, the, water, this, species, was, previously, known, as, troost, s, turtle, in, honor, of, an, american, herpetologist, gerard, troost, trachemys, scripta, troostii, is, now, the, scientific, name, for, another, subspecies, the, cumberland, slider, the, red, eared, slider, belongs, to, the, order, testudines, which, contains, about, 250, turtle, species, it, is, a, subspecies, of, trachemys, scripta, it, was, previously, classified, under, the, name, chrysemys, scripta, elegans, trachemys, scripta, contains, three, subspecies, t, s, elegans, red, eared, slider, t, s, scripta, yellow, bellied, slider, and, t, s, troostii, cumberland, slider, the, carapace, of, this, species, can, reach, more, than, 40, cm, 16, in, in, length, but, the, typical, length, ranges, from, 15, to, 20, cm, 6, to, 8, in, the, females, of, the, species, are, usually, larger, than, the, males, they, typically, live, between, 20, 30, years, although, some, individuals, can, live, for, more, than, 70, years, their, life, expectancy, is, shorter, when, they, are, kept, in, captivity, the, quality, of, their, living, environment, has, a, strong, influence, on, their, lifespans, and, well, being, the, shell, is, divided, into, the, upper, or, dorsal, carapace, and, the, lower, ventral, carapace, or, plastron, the, upper, carapace, consists, of, the, vertebral, scutes, which, form, the, central, elevated, portion, pleural, scutes, that, are, located, around, the, vertebral, scutes, and, then, the, marginal, scutes, around, the, edge, of, the, carapace, the, rear, marginal, scutes, are, notched, the, scutes, are, bony, keratinous, elements, the, carapace, is, oval, and, flattened, especially, in, the, male, and, has, a, weak, keel, that, is, more, pronounced, in, the, young, the, color, of, the, carapace, changes, depending, on, the, age, of, the, turtle, it, usually, has, a, dark, green, background, with, light, and, dark, highly, variable, markings, in, young, or, recently, hatched, turtles, it, is, leaf, green, and, gets, slightly, darker, as, a, turtle, gets, older, until, it, is, a, very, dark, green, and, then, turns, a, shade, between, brown, and, olive, green, the, plastron, is, always, a, light, yellow, with, dark, paired, irregular, markings, in, the, centre, of, most, scutes, the, plastron, is, highly, variable, in, pattern, the, head, legs, and, tail, are, green, with, fine, irregular, yellow, lines, the, whole, shell, is, covered, in, these, stripes, and, markings, that, aid, in, camouflaging, an, individual, these, turtles, also, have, a, complete, skeletal, system, with, partially, webbed, feet, that, help, them, to, swim, and, that, can, be, withdrawn, inside, the, carapace, along, with, the, head, and, tail, the, red, stripe, on, each, side, of, the, head, distinguishes, the, red, eared, slider, from, all, other, north, american, species, and, gives, this, species, its, name, as, the, stripe, is, located, behind, the, eyes, where, their, external, ears, would, be, these, stripes, may, lose, their, color, over, time, color, and, vibrance, of, ear, stripe, can, indicate, immune, health, with, bright, red, having, higher, immune, response, than, yellow, stripes, some, individuals, can, also, have, a, small, mark, of, the, same, color, on, the, top, of, their, heads, the, red, eared, slider, does, not, have, a, visible, outer, ear, or, an, external, auditory, canal, instead, it, relies, on, a, middle, ear, entirely, covered, by, a, cartilaginous, tympanic, disc, like, other, turtles, the, species, is, poikilotherm, and, thus, dependent, on, the, temperature, of, its, environment, for, this, reason, it, needs, to, sunbathe, frequently, to, warm, up, and, maintain, body, temperature, some, dimorphism, exists, between, males, and, females, red, eared, slider, young, look, practically, identical, regardless, of, their, sex, making, distinguishing, them, difficult, one, useful, method, however, is, to, inspect, the, markings, under, their, carapace, which, fade, as, the, turtles, age, distinguishing, the, sex, of, adults, is, much, easier, as, the, shells, of, mature, males, are, smaller, than, those, of, females, male, red, eared, sliders, reach, sexual, maturity, when, their, carapaces, diameters, measure, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, and, females, reach, maturity, when, their, carapaces, measure, about, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, both, males, and, females, reach, sexual, maturity, at, 5, 6, years, old, males, are, normally, smaller, than, females, although, this, parameter, is, sometimes, difficult, to, apply, as, individuals, being, compared, could, be, of, different, ages, males, have, longer, claws, on, their, front, feet, than, the, females, this, helps, them, to, hold, onto, a, female, during, mating, and, is, used, during, courtship, displays, the, males, tails, are, thicker, and, longer, typically, the, cloacal, opening, of, a, female, is, at, or, under, the, rear, edge, of, the, carapace, while, the, male, s, opening, occurs, beyond, the, edge, of, the, carapace, the, male, s, plastron, is, slightly, concave, while, that, of, the, female, is, completely, flat, the, male, s, concave, plastron, also, helps, to, stabilize, the, male, on, the, female, s, carapace, during, mating, older, males, can, sometimes, have, a, dark, greyish, olive, green, melanistic, coloration, with, very, subdued, markings, the, red, stripe, on, the, sides, of, the, head, may, be, difficult, to, see, or, be, absent, the, female, s, appearance, is, substantially, the, same, throughout, her, life, the, red, eared, slider, originated, from, the, area, around, the, mississippi, river, and, the, gulf, of, mexico, in, warm, climates, in, the, southeastern, united, states, their, native, areas, range, from, the, southeast, of, colorado, to, virginia, and, florida, in, nature, they, inhabit, areas, with, a, source, of, still, warm, water, such, as, ponds, lakes, swamps, creeks, streams, or, slow, flowing, rivers, they, live, in, areas, of, calm, water, where, they, are, able, to, leave, the, water, easily, by, climbing, onto, rocks, or, tree, trunks, so, they, can, warm, up, in, the, sun, individuals, are, often, found, sunbathing, in, a, group, or, even, on, top, of, each, other, they, also, require, abundant, aquatic, plants, as, these, are, the, adults, main, food, although, they, are, omnivores, turtles, in, the, wild, always, remain, close, to, water, unless, they, are, searching, for, a, new, habitat, or, when, females, leave, the, water, to, lay, their, eggs, invasive, red, eared, sliders, cause, negative, impacts, in, the, ecosystems, they, are, introduced, to, because, they, have, certain, advantages, over, the, native, populations, such, as, a, lower, age, at, maturity, higher, fecundity, rates, and, larger, body, size, which, gives, them, a, competitive, advantage, at, basking, and, nesting, sites, as, well, as, when, exploiting, food, resources, they, also, transmit, diseases, and, displace, the, other, turtle, species, with, which, they, compete, for, food, and, breeding, space, owing, to, their, popularity, as, pets, red, eared, sliders, have, been, released, or, escaped, into, the, wild, in, many, parts, of, the, world, this, turtle, is, considered, one, of, the, world, s, worst, invasive, species, feral, populations, are, now, found, in, bermuda, canada, australia, europe, great, britain, south, africa, the, caribbean, islands, israel, bahrain, the, mariana, islands, guam, russia, and, south, and, far, east, asia, within, great, britain, red, eared, sliders, have, a, wide, distribution, throughout, england, scotland, and, wales, in, australia, it, is, illegal, for, members, of, the, public, to, import, keep, trade, or, release, red, eared, sliders, as, they, are, regarded, as, an, invasive, species, see, below, their, import, has, also, been, banned, by, the, european, union, as, well, as, specific, eu, member, countries, in, 2015, japan, announced, it, was, planning, to, ban, the, import, of, red, eared, sliders, but, it, would, probably, not, take, effect, until, 2020, red, eared, sliders, are, almost, entirely, aquatic, but, as, they, are, cold, blooded, they, leave, the, water, to, sunbathe, to, regulate, their, temperature, red, eared, sliders, do, not, hibernate, but, actually, brumate, while, they, become, less, active, they, do, occasionally, rise, to, the, surface, for, food, or, air, brumation, can, occur, to, varying, degrees, in, the, wild, red, eared, sliders, brumate, over, the, winter, at, the, bottoms, of, ponds, or, shallow, lakes, they, generally, become, inactive, in, october, when, temperatures, fall, below, 10, c, 50, f, during, this, time, the, turtles, enter, a, state, of, sopor, during, which, they, do, not, eat, or, defecate, they, remain, nearly, motionless, and, the, frequency, of, their, breathing, falls, individuals, usually, brumate, under, water, but, they, have, also, been, found, under, banks, and, rocks, and, in, hollow, stumps, in, warmer, winter, climates, they, can, become, active, and, come, to, the, surface, for, basking, when, the, temperature, begins, to, drop, again, however, they, quickly, return, to, a, brumation, state, sliders, generally, come, up, for, food, in, early, march, to, as, late, as, the, end, of, april, during, brumation, t, s, elegans, can, survive, anaerobically, for, weeks, producing, atp, from, glycolysis, the, turtle, s, metabolic, rate, drops, dramatically, with, heart, rate, and, cardiac, output, dropping, by, 80, to, minimize, energy, requirements, the, lactic, acid, produced, is, buffered, by, minerals, in, the, shell, preventing, acidosis, red, eared, sliders, kept, captive, indoors, should, not, brumate, courtship, and, mating, activities, for, red, eared, sliders, usually, occur, between, march, and, july, and, take, place, under, water, during, courtship, the, male, swims, around, the, female, and, flutters, or, vibrates, the, back, side, of, his, long, claws, on, and, around, her, face, and, head, possibly, to, direct, pheromones, towards, her, the, female, swims, toward, the, male, and, if, she, is, receptive, sinks, to, the, bottom, for, mating, if, the, female, is, not, receptive, she, may, become, aggressive, towards, the, male, courtship, can, last, 45, minutes, but, mating, takes, only, 10, minutes, on, occasion, a, male, may, appear, to, be, courting, another, male, and, when, kept, in, captivity, may, also, show, this, behaviour, towards, other, household, pets, between, male, turtles, it, could, be, a, sign, of, dominance, and, may, preclude, a, fight, young, turtles, may, carry, out, the, courtship, dance, before, they, reach, sexual, maturity, at, 5, years, of, age, but, they, are, unable, to, mate, after, mating, the, female, spends, extra, time, basking, to, keep, her, eggs, warm, she, may, also, have, a, change, of, diet, eating, only, certain, foods, or, not, eating, as, much, as, she, normally, would, a, female, can, lay, between, two, and, 30, eggs, depending, on, body, size, and, other, factors, one, female, can, lay, up, to, 5, clutches, in, the, same, year, and, clutches, are, usually, spaced, 12, 36, days, apart, the, time, between, mating, and, egg, laying, can, be, days, or, weeks, the, fertilization, and, laying, can, also, be, in, conjunction, with, eggs, immediately, laid, based, on, location, and, nutrients, available, the, actual, egg, fertilization, takes, place, during, the, egg, laying, this, process, also, permits, the, laying, of, fertile, eggs, the, following, season, as, the, sperm, can, remain, viable, and, available, in, the, female, s, body, in, the, absence, of, mating, during, the, last, weeks, of, gestation, the, female, spends, less, time, in, the, water, and, smells, and, scratches, at, the, ground, indicating, she, is, searching, for, a, suitable, place, to, lay, her, eggs, the, female, excavates, a, hole, using, her, hind, legs, and, lays, her, eggs, in, it, incubation, takes, 59, 112, days, late, season, hatchlings, may, spend, the, winter, in, the, nest, and, emerge, when, the, weather, warms, in, the, spring, just, prior, to, hatching, the, egg, contains, 50, turtle, and, 50, egg, sac, a, new, hatchling, breaks, open, its, egg, with, its, egg, tooth, which, falls, out, about, an, hour, after, hatching, this, egg, tooth, never, grows, back, hatchlings, may, stay, inside, their, eggshells, after, hatching, for, the, first, day, or, two, if, they, are, forced, to, leave, the, eggshell, before, they, are, ready, they, will, return, if, possible, when, a, hatchling, decides, to, leave, the, shell, it, still, has, a, small, sac, protruding, from, its, plastron, the, yolk, sac, is, vital, and, provides, nourishment, while, visible, and, several, days, later, it, will, have, been, absorbed, into, the, turtle, s, belly, the, sac, must, be, absorbed, and, does, not, fall, off, the, split, must, heal, on, its, own, before, the, turtle, is, able, to, swim, the, time, between, the, egg, hatching, and, water, entry, is, 21, days, damage, to, or, inordinate, motion, of, the, protruding, egg, yolk, enough, to, allow, air, into, the, turtle, s, body, results, in, death, this, is, the, main, reason, for, marking, the, top, of, turtle, eggs, if, their, relocation, is, required, for, any, reason, an, egg, turned, upside, down, will, eventually, terminate, the, embryo, s, growth, by, the, sac, smothering, the, embryo, if, it, manages, to, reach, term, the, turtle, will, try, to, flip, over, with, the, yolk, sac, which, would, allow, air, into, the, body, cavity, and, cause, death, the, other, fatal, danger, is, water, getting, into, the, body, cavity, before, the, sac, is, absorbed, completely, and, while, the, opening, has, not, completely, healed, yet, the, sex, of, red, eared, sliders, is, determined, by, the, incubation, temperature, during, critical, phases, of, the, embryos, development, only, males, are, produced, when, eggs, are, incubated, at, temperatures, of, 22, 27, c, 72, 81, f, whereas, females, develop, at, warmer, temperatures, colder, temperatures, result, in, the, death, of, the, embryos, red, eared, slider, turtles, are, the, world, s, most, commonly, traded, reptile, due, to, their, relatively, low, price, and, usually, low, food, price, small, size, and, easy, maintenance, as, with, other, turtles, tortoises, and, box, turtles, individuals, that, survive, their, first, year, or, two, can, be, expected, to, live, generally, around, 30, years, they, present, an, infection, risk, particularly, of, salmonella, reptiles, are, asymptomatic, meaning, they, suffer, no, adverse, side, effects, carriers, of, bacteria, of, the, genus, salmonella, this, has, given, rise, to, justifiable, concerns, given, the, many, instances, of, infection, of, humans, caused, by, the, handling, of, turtles, which, has, led, to, restrictions, in, the, sale, of, red, eared, sliders, in, the, usa, a, 1975, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, regulation, bans, the, sale, for, general, commercial, and, public, use, of, both, turtle, eggs, and, turtles, with, a, carapace, length, less, than, 4, in, 10, cm, this, regulation, comes, under, the, public, health, service, act, and, is, enforced, by, the, fda, in, cooperation, with, state, and, local, health, jurisdictions, the, ban, was, enacted, because, of, the, public, health, impact, of, turtle, associated, salmonellosis, turtles, and, turtle, eggs, found, to, be, offered, for, sale, in, violation, of, this, provision, are, subject, to, destruction, in, accordance, with, fda, procedures, a, fine, up, to, 1, 001, and, or, imprisonment, for, up, to, one, year, is, the, penalty, for, those, who, refuse, to, comply, with, a, valid, final, demand, for, destruction, of, such, turtles, or, their, eggs, many, stores, and, flea, markets, still, sell, small, turtles, due, to, an, exception, in, the, fda, regulation, that, allows, turtles, under, 4, in, 10, cm, to, be, sold, for, bona, fide, scientific, educational, or, exhibition, purposes, other, than, use, as, pets, as, with, many, other, animals, and, inanimate, objects, the, risk, of, salmonella, exposure, can, be, reduced, by, following, basic, rules, of, cleanliness, small, children, must, be, taught, to, wash, their, hands, immediately, after, they, finish, playing, with, the, turtle, feeding, it, or, changing, its, water, some, states, have, other, laws, and, regulations, regarding, possession, of, red, eared, sliders, because, they, can, be, an, invasive, species, where, they, are, not, native, and, have, been, introduced, through, the, pet, trade, it, is, illegal, in, florida, to, sell, any, wild, type, red, eared, slider, as, they, interbreed, with, the, local, yellow, bellied, slider, population, t, s, scripta, which, is, another, subspecies, of, pond, sliders, and, hybrids, typically, combine, the, markings, of, the, two, subspecies, however, unusual, color, varieties, such, as, albino, and, pastel, red, eared, sliders, which, are, derived, from, captive, breeding, are, still, allowed, for, sale, in, australia, breeding, populations, have, been, found, in, new, south, wales, and, queensland, and, individual, turtles, have, been, found, in, the, wild, in, victoria, the, australian, capital, territory, and, western, australia, red, eared, slider, turtles, are, considered, a, significant, threat, to, native, turtle, species, they, mature, more, quickly, grow, larger, produce, more, offspring, and, are, more, aggressive, numerous, studies, indicate, that, red, eared, slider, turtles, can, out, compete, native, turtles, for, food, and, nesting, and, basking, sites, unlike, the, general, diet, of, pet, red, eared, sliders, wild, red, eared, sliders, are, usually, omnivorous, because, red, eared, slider, turtles, eat, plants, as, well, as, animals, they, could, also, have, a, negative, impact, on, a, range, of, native, aquatic, species, including, rare, frogs, also, a, significant, risk, exists, that, red, eared, slider, turtles, can, transfer, diseases, and, parasites, to, native, reptile, species, a, malaria, like, parasite, was, spread, to, two, wild, turtle, populations, in, lane, cove, river, sydney, social, and, economic, costs, are, also, likely, to, be, substantial, the, queensland, government, has, invested, close, to, au, 1, million, in, eradication, programs, to, date, the, turtle, may, also, cause, significant, public, health, costs, due, to, the, impacts, of, turtle, associated, salmonella, on, human, health, outbreaks, in, multiple, states, and, fatalities, in, children, associated, with, handling, salmonella, infected, turtles, have, been, recorded, in, the, us, salmonella, can, also, spread, to, humans, when, turtles, contaminate, drinking, water, the, actions, by, state, governments, have, varied, considerably, to, date, ranging, from, ongoing, eradication, efforts, by, the, queensland, government, to, very, little, action, by, the, government, of, new, south, wales, experts, have, ranked, the, species, as, high, priority, for, management, in, australia, and, are, calling, for, a, national, prevention, and, eradication, strategy, including, a, concerted, education, and, compliance, program, to, stop, the, illegal, trade, possession, and, release, of, slider, turtles, red, eared, slider, turtles, are, threatening, to, invade, the, natural, water, bodies, across, northeast, india, which, are, home, to, 21, out, of, 29, vulnerable, native, indian, species, of, freshwater, turtle, between, august, 2018, and, june, 2019, a, team, of, herpetologists, from, the, ngo, help, earth, found, red, eared, sliders, in, the, deepor, beel, wildlife, sanctuary, and, ugratara, devalaya, temple, pond, further, reports, have, been, made, from, an, unnamed, stream, feeding, into, the, tlawng, river, on, a, farm, in, the, mizoram, capital, aizawl, within, the, second, volume, of, the, tales, of, the, teenage, mutant, ninja, turtles, the, popular, comic, book, heroes, were, revealed, as, specimens, of, the, red, eared, slider, the, popularity, of, the, ninja, turtles, coupled, with, the, release, of, the, first, live, action, film, led, to, a, craze, for, keeping, them, as, pets, in, united, kingdom, with, subsequent, ecological, havoc, as, turtles, were, accidentally, or, deliberately, released, into, the, wild
