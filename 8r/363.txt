crustaceans, from, latin, meaning, those, with, shells, or, crusted, ones, are, invertebrate, animals, that, constitute, one, group, of, arthropods, that, are, a, part, of, the, subphylum, crustacea, k, r, s, t, e, a, large, diverse, group, of, mainly, aquatic, arthropods, including, decapods, shrimps, prawns, crabs, lobsters, and, crayfish, seed, shrimp, branchiopods, fish, lice, krill, remipedes, isopods, barnacles, copepods, opossum, shrimps, amphipods, and, mantis, shrimp, the, crustacean, group, can, be, treated, as, a, subphylum, under, the, clade, mandibulata, it, is, now, well, accepted, that, the, hexapods, insects, and, entognathans, emerged, deep, in, the, crustacean, group, with, the, completed, pan, group, referred, to, as, pancrustacea, the, three, classes, cephalocarida, branchiopoda, and, remipedia, are, more, closely, related, to, the, hexapods, than, they, are, to, any, of, the, other, crustaceans, oligostracans, and, multicrustaceans, the, 67, 000, described, species, range, in, size, from, stygotantulus, stocki, at, 0, 1, mm, 0, 004, in, to, the, japanese, spider, crab, with, a, leg, span, of, up, to, 3, 8, m, 12, 5, ft, and, a, mass, of, 20, kg, 44, lb, like, other, arthropods, crustaceans, have, an, exoskeleton, which, they, moult, to, grow, they, are, distinguished, from, other, groups, of, arthropods, such, as, insects, myriapods, and, chelicerates, by, the, possession, of, biramous, two, parted, limbs, and, by, their, larval, forms, such, as, the, nauplius, stage, of, branchiopods, and, copepods, most, crustaceans, are, free, living, aquatic, animals, but, some, are, terrestrial, e, g, woodlice, sandhoppers, some, are, parasitic, e, g, rhizocephala, fish, lice, tongue, worms, and, some, are, sessile, e, g, barnacles, the, group, has, an, extensive, fossil, record, reaching, back, to, the, cambrian, more, than, 7, 9, million, tons, of, crustaceans, per, year, are, harvested, by, fishery, or, farming, for, human, consumption, consisting, mostly, of, shrimp, and, prawns, krill, and, copepods, are, not, as, widely, fished, but, may, be, the, animals, with, the, greatest, biomass, on, the, planet, and, form, a, vital, part, of, the, food, chain, the, scientific, study, of, crustaceans, is, known, as, carcinology, alternatively, malacostracology, crustaceology, or, crustalogy, and, a, scientist, who, works, in, carcinology, is, a, carcinologist, the, body, of, a, crustacean, is, composed, of, segments, which, are, grouped, into, three, regions, the, cephalon, or, head, the, pereon, or, thorax, and, the, pleon, or, abdomen, the, head, and, thorax, may, be, fused, together, to, form, a, cephalothorax, which, may, be, covered, by, a, single, large, carapace, the, crustacean, body, is, protected, by, the, hard, exoskeleton, which, must, be, moulted, for, the, animal, to, grow, the, shell, around, each, somite, can, be, divided, into, a, dorsal, tergum, ventral, sternum, and, a, lateral, pleuron, various, parts, of, the, exoskeleton, may, be, fused, together, 289, each, somite, or, body, segment, can, bear, a, pair, of, appendages, on, the, segments, of, the, head, these, include, two, pairs, of, antennae, the, mandibles, and, maxillae, the, thoracic, segments, bear, legs, which, may, be, specialised, as, pereiopods, walking, legs, and, maxillipeds, feeding, legs, malacostraca, and, remipedia, and, the, hexapods, have, abdominal, appendages, all, other, classes, of, crustaceans, have, a, limbless, abdomen, except, from, a, telson, and, caudal, rami, which, is, present, in, many, groups, the, abdomen, in, malacostracans, bears, pleopods, and, ends, in, a, telson, which, bears, the, anus, and, is, often, flanked, by, uropods, to, form, a, tail, fan, the, number, and, variety, of, appendages, in, different, crustaceans, may, be, partly, responsible, for, the, group, s, success, crustacean, appendages, are, typically, biramous, meaning, they, are, divided, into, two, parts, this, includes, the, second, pair, of, antennae, but, not, the, first, which, is, usually, uniramous, the, exception, being, in, the, class, malacostraca, where, the, antennules, may, be, generally, biramous, or, even, triramous, it, is, unclear, whether, the, biramous, condition, is, a, derived, state, which, evolved, in, crustaceans, or, whether, the, second, branch, of, the, limb, has, been, lost, in, all, other, groups, trilobites, for, instance, also, possessed, biramous, appendages, the, main, body, cavity, is, an, open, circulatory, system, where, blood, is, pumped, into, the, haemocoel, by, a, heart, located, near, the, dorsum, malacostraca, have, haemocyanin, as, the, oxygen, carrying, pigment, while, copepods, ostracods, barnacles, and, branchiopods, have, haemoglobins, the, alimentary, canal, consists, of, a, straight, tube, that, often, has, a, gizzard, like, gastric, mill, for, grinding, food, and, a, pair, of, digestive, glands, that, absorb, food, this, structure, goes, in, a, spiral, format, structures, that, function, as, kidneys, are, located, near, the, antennae, a, brain, exists, in, the, form, of, ganglia, close, to, the, antennae, and, a, collection, of, major, ganglia, is, found, below, the, gut, in, many, decapods, the, first, and, sometimes, the, second, pair, of, pleopods, are, specialised, in, the, male, for, sperm, transfer, many, terrestrial, crustaceans, such, as, the, christmas, island, red, crab, mate, seasonally, and, return, to, the, sea, to, release, the, eggs, others, such, as, woodlice, lay, their, eggs, on, land, albeit, in, damp, conditions, in, most, decapods, the, females, retain, the, eggs, until, they, hatch, into, free, swimming, larvae, most, crustaceans, are, aquatic, living, in, either, marine, or, freshwater, environments, but, a, few, groups, have, adapted, to, life, on, land, such, as, terrestrial, crabs, terrestrial, hermit, crabs, and, woodlice, marine, crustaceans, are, as, ubiquitous, in, the, oceans, as, insects, are, on, land, most, crustaceans, are, also, motile, moving, about, independently, although, a, few, taxonomic, units, are, parasitic, and, live, attached, to, their, hosts, including, sea, lice, fish, lice, whale, lice, tongue, worms, and, cymothoa, exigua, all, of, which, may, be, referred, to, as, crustacean, lice, and, adult, barnacles, live, a, sessile, life, they, are, attached, headfirst, to, the, substrate, and, cannot, move, independently, some, branchiurans, are, able, to, withstand, rapid, changes, of, salinity, and, will, also, switch, hosts, from, marine, to, non, marine, species, 672, krill, are, the, bottom, layer, and, most, important, part, of, the, food, chain, in, antarctic, animal, communities, 64, some, crustaceans, are, significant, invasive, species, such, as, the, chinese, mitten, crab, eriocheir, sinensis, and, the, asian, shore, crab, hemigrapsus, sanguineus, since, the, opening, of, the, suez, canal, close, to, 100, species, of, crustaceans, from, the, red, sea, and, the, indo, pacific, realm, have, established, themselves, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, sub, basin, with, often, significant, impact, on, local, ecosystems, most, crustaceans, have, separate, sexes, and, reproduce, sexually, in, fact, a, recent, study, explains, how, the, male, t, californicus, decide, which, females, to, mate, with, by, dietary, differences, preferring, when, the, females, are, algae, fed, instead, of, yeast, fed, a, small, number, are, hermaphrodites, including, barnacles, remipedes, and, cephalocarida, some, may, even, change, sex, during, the, course, of, their, life, parthenogenesis, is, also, widespread, among, crustaceans, where, viable, eggs, are, produced, by, a, female, without, needing, fertilisation, by, a, male, this, occurs, in, many, branchiopods, some, ostracods, some, isopods, and, certain, higher, crustaceans, such, as, the, marmorkrebs, crayfish, in, many, crustaceans, the, fertilised, eggs, are, released, into, the, water, column, while, others, have, developed, a, number, of, mechanisms, for, holding, on, to, the, eggs, until, they, are, ready, to, hatch, most, decapods, carry, the, eggs, attached, to, the, pleopods, while, peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and, many, isopods, form, a, brood, pouch, from, the, carapace, and, thoracic, limbs, female, branchiura, do, not, carry, eggs, in, external, ovisacs, but, attach, them, in, rows, to, rocks, and, other, objects, 788, most, leptostracans, and, krill, carry, the, eggs, between, their, thoracic, limbs, some, copepods, carry, their, eggs, in, special, thin, walled, sacs, while, others, have, them, attached, together, in, long, tangled, strings, crustaceans, exhibit, a, number, of, larval, forms, of, which, the, earliest, and, most, characteristic, is, the, nauplius, this, has, three, pairs, of, appendages, all, emerging, from, the, young, animal, s, head, and, a, single, naupliar, eye, in, most, groups, there, are, further, larval, stages, including, the, zoea, pl, zoe, or, zoeas, this, name, was, given, to, it, when, naturalists, believed, it, to, be, a, separate, species, it, follows, the, nauplius, stage, and, precedes, the, post, larva, zoea, larvae, swim, with, their, thoracic, appendages, as, opposed, to, nauplii, which, use, cephalic, appendages, and, megalopa, which, use, abdominal, appendages, for, swimming, it, often, has, spikes, on, its, carapace, which, may, assist, these, small, organisms, in, maintaining, directional, swimming, in, many, decapods, due, to, their, accelerated, development, the, zoea, is, the, first, larval, stage, in, some, cases, the, zoea, stage, is, followed, by, the, mysis, stage, and, in, others, by, the, megalopa, stage, depending, on, the, crustacean, group, involved, providing, camouflage, against, predators, the, otherwise, black, eyes, in, several, forms, of, swimming, larvae, are, covered, by, a, thin, layer, of, crystalline, isoxanthopterin, that, gives, their, eyes, the, same, color, as, the, surrounding, water, while, tiny, holes, in, the, layer, allow, light, to, reach, the, retina, as, the, larvae, mature, into, adults, the, layer, migrates, to, a, new, position, behind, the, retina, where, it, works, as, a, backscattering, mirror, that, increases, the, intensity, of, light, passing, through, the, eyes, as, seen, in, many, nocturnal, animals, in, an, effort, to, understand, whether, dna, repair, processes, can, protect, crustaceans, against, dna, damage, basic, research, was, conducted, to, elucidate, the, repair, mechanisms, used, by, penaeus, monodon, black, tiger, shrimp, repair, of, dna, double, strand, breaks, was, found, to, be, predominantly, carried, out, by, accurate, homologous, recombinational, repair, another, less, accurate, process, microhomology, mediated, end, joining, is, also, used, to, repair, such, breaks, the, expression, pattern, of, dna, repair, related, and, dna, damage, response, genes, in, the, intertidal, copepod, tigriopus, japonicus, was, analyzed, after, ultraviolet, irradiation, this, study, revealed, increased, expression, of, proteins, associated, with, the, dna, repair, processes, of, non, homologous, end, joining, homologous, recombination, base, excision, repair, and, dna, mismatch, repair, the, name, crustacean, dates, from, the, earliest, works, to, describe, the, animals, including, those, of, pierre, belon, and, guillaume, rondelet, but, the, name, was, not, used, by, some, later, authors, including, carl, linnaeus, who, included, crustaceans, among, the, aptera, in, his, systema, naturae, the, earliest, nomenclatural, valid, work, to, use, the, name, crustacea, was, morten, thrane, br, nnich, s, zoologi, fundamenta, in, 1772, although, he, also, included, chelicerates, in, the, group, the, subphylum, crustacea, comprises, almost, 67, 000, described, species, which, is, thought, to, be, just, 1, 10, to, 1, 100, of, the, total, number, as, most, species, remain, as, yet, undiscovered, although, most, crustaceans, are, small, their, morphology, varies, greatly, and, includes, both, the, largest, arthropod, in, the, world, the, japanese, spider, crab, with, a, leg, span, of, 3, 7, metres, 12, ft, and, the, smallest, the, 100, micrometre, long, 0, 004, in, stygotantulus, stocki, despite, their, diversity, of, form, crustaceans, are, united, by, the, special, larval, form, known, as, the, nauplius, the, exact, relationships, of, the, crustacea, to, other, taxa, are, not, completely, settled, as, of, april, 2012, studies, based, on, morphology, led, to, the, pancrustacea, hypothesis, in, which, crustacea, and, hexapoda, insects, and, allies, are, sister, groups, more, recent, studies, using, dna, sequences, suggest, that, crustacea, is, paraphyletic, with, the, hexapods, nested, within, a, larger, pancrustacea, clade, the, traditional, classification, of, crustacea, based, on, morphology, recognised, four, to, six, classes, bowman, and, abele, 1982, recognised, 652, extant, families, and, 38, orders, organised, into, six, classes, branchiopoda, remipedia, cephalocarida, maxillopoda, ostracoda, and, malacostraca, martin, and, davis, 2001, updated, this, classification, retaining, the, six, classes, but, including, 849, extant, families, in, 42, orders, despite, outlining, the, evidence, that, maxillopoda, was, non, monophyletic, they, retained, it, as, one, of, the, six, classes, although, did, suggest, that, maxillipoda, could, be, replaced, by, elevating, its, subclasses, to, classes, since, then, phylogenetic, studies, have, confirmed, the, polyphyly, of, maxillipoda, and, the, paraphyletic, nature, of, crustacea, with, respect, to, hexapoda, recent, classifications, recognise, ten, to, twelve, classes, in, crustacea, or, pancrustacea, with, several, former, maxillopod, subclasses, now, recognised, as, classes, e, g, thecostraca, tantulocarida, mystacocarida, copepoda, branchiura, and, pentastomida, the, following, cladogram, shows, the, updated, relationships, between, the, different, extant, groups, of, the, paraphyletic, crustacea, in, relation, to, the, class, hexapoda, ostracoda, mystacocarida, branchiura, pentastomida, malacostraca, copepoda, tantulocarida, thecostraca, cephalocarida, branchiopoda, remipedia, hexapoda, according, to, this, diagram, the, hexapoda, are, deep, in, the, crustacea, tree, and, any, of, the, hexapoda, is, distinctly, closer, to, e, g, a, multicrustacean, than, an, oligostracan, is, crustaceans, have, a, rich, and, extensive, fossil, record, which, begins, with, animals, such, as, canadaspis, and, perspicaris, from, the, middle, cambrian, age, burgess, shale, most, of, the, major, groups, of, crustaceans, appear, in, the, fossil, record, before, the, end, of, the, cambrian, namely, the, branchiopoda, maxillopoda, including, barnacles, and, tongue, worms, and, malacostraca, there, is, some, debate, as, to, whether, or, not, cambrian, animals, assigned, to, ostracoda, are, truly, ostracods, which, would, otherwise, start, in, the, ordovician, the, only, classes, to, appear, later, are, the, cephalocarida, which, have, no, fossil, record, and, the, remipedia, which, were, first, described, from, the, fossil, tesnusocaris, goldichi, but, do, not, appear, until, the, carboniferous, most, of, the, early, crustaceans, are, rare, but, fossil, crustaceans, become, abundant, from, the, carboniferous, period, onwards, within, the, malacostraca, no, fossils, are, known, for, krill, while, both, hoplocarida, and, phyllopoda, contain, important, groups, that, are, now, extinct, as, well, as, extant, members, hoplocarida, mantis, shrimp, are, extant, while, aeschronectida, are, extinct, phyllopoda, canadaspidida, are, extinct, while, leptostraca, are, extant, cumacea, and, isopoda, are, both, known, from, the, carboniferous, as, are, the, first, true, mantis, shrimp, in, the, decapoda, prawns, and, polychelids, appear, in, the, triassic, and, shrimp, and, crabs, appear, in, the, jurassic, the, fossil, burrow, ophiomorpha, is, attributed, to, ghost, shrimps, whereas, the, fossil, burrow, camborygma, is, attributed, to, crayfishes, the, permian, triassic, deposits, of, nurra, preserve, the, oldest, permian, roadian, fluvial, burrows, ascribed, to, ghost, shrimps, decapoda, axiidea, gebiidea, and, crayfishes, decapoda, astacidea, parastacidea, respectively, however, the, great, radiation, of, crustaceans, occurred, in, the, cretaceous, particularly, in, crabs, and, may, have, been, driven, by, the, adaptive, radiation, of, their, main, predators, bony, fish, the, first, true, lobsters, also, appear, in, the, cretaceous, many, crustaceans, are, consumed, by, humans, and, nearly, 10, 700, 000, tons, were, harvested, in, 2007, the, vast, majority, of, this, output, is, of, decapod, crustaceans, crabs, lobsters, shrimp, crawfish, and, prawns, over, 60, by, weight, of, all, crustaceans, caught, for, consumption, are, shrimp, and, prawns, and, nearly, 80, is, produced, in, asia, with, china, alone, producing, nearly, half, the, world, s, total, non, decapod, crustaceans, are, not, widely, consumed, with, only, 118, 000, tons, of, krill, being, caught, despite, krill, having, one, of, the, greatest, biomasses, on, the, planet
