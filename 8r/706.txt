kiwi, stictapteryx, iredale, mathews, 1926, kiwi, verheyen, 1960, pseudapteryx, lydekker, 1891, kiwi, k, i, w, i, kee, wee, are, flightless, birds, endemic, to, new, zealand, of, the, order, apterygiformes, the, five, extant, species, fall, into, the, family, apterygidae, p, t, r, d, d, i, and, genus, apteryx, p, t, r, k, s, approximately, the, size, of, a, domestic, chicken, kiwi, are, the, smallest, ratites, which, also, include, ostriches, emus, rheas, cassowaries, and, the, extinct, elephant, birds, and, moa, dna, sequence, comparisons, have, yielded, the, conclusion, that, kiwi, are, much, more, closely, related, to, the, extinct, malagasy, elephant, birds, than, to, the, moa, with, which, they, shared, new, zealand, there, are, five, recognised, species, four, of, which, are, currently, listed, as, vulnerable, and, one, of, which, is, near, threatened, all, species, have, been, negatively, affected, by, historic, deforestation, but, their, remaining, habitat, is, well, protected, in, large, forest, reserves, and, national, parks, at, present, the, greatest, threat, to, their, survival, is, predation, by, invasive, mammalian, predators, the, vestigial, wings, are, so, small, as, to, be, invisible, under, their, bristly, hair, like, two, branched, feathers, kiwi, eggs, are, one, of, the, largest, in, proportion, to, body, size, up, to, 20, of, the, female, s, weight, of, any, order, of, bird, in, the, world, other, unique, adaptations, of, kiwi, such, as, short, and, stout, legs, and, using, their, nostrils, at, the, end, of, their, long, beak, to, detect, prey, before, they, see, it, have, helped, the, bird, to, become, internationally, well, known, the, kiwi, is, recognised, as, an, icon, of, new, zealand, and, the, association, is, so, strong, that, the, term, kiwi, is, used, internationally, as, the, colloquial, demonym, for, new, zealanders, the, m, ori, language, word, kiwi, is, generally, accepted, to, be, of, imitative, origin, from, the, call, however, some, linguists, derive, the, word, from, proto, nuclear, polynesian, kiwi, which, refers, to, numenius, tahitiensis, the, bristle, thighed, curlew, a, migratory, bird, that, winters, in, the, tropical, pacific, islands, with, its, long, decurved, bill, and, brown, body, the, curlew, resembles, the, kiwi, so, when, the, first, polynesian, settlers, arrived, they, may, have, applied, the, word, kiwi, to, the, newfound, bird, the, bird, s, name, is, spelled, with, a, lower, case, k, and, being, a, word, of, m, ori, origin, normally, stays, as, kiwi, when, pluralised, the, genus, name, apteryx, is, derived, from, ancient, greek, without, wing, a, without, or, not, pt, ryx, wing, although, it, was, long, presumed, that, the, kiwi, was, closely, related, to, the, other, new, zealand, ratites, the, moa, recent, dna, studies, have, identified, its, closest, relative, as, the, extinct, elephant, bird, of, madagascar, and, among, extant, ratites, the, kiwi, is, more, closely, related, to, the, emu, and, the, cassowaries, than, to, the, moa, research, published, in, 2013, on, an, extinct, genus, proapteryx, known, from, the, miocene, deposits, of, the, saint, bathans, fauna, found, that, it, was, smaller, and, probably, capable, of, flight, supporting, the, hypothesis, that, the, ancestor, of, the, kiwi, reached, new, zealand, independently, from, moas, which, were, already, large, and, flightless, by, the, time, kiwi, appeared, there, are, five, known, species, of, kiwi, with, a, number, of, subspecies, a, haastii, a, owenii, a, australis, a, rowi, a, mantelli, relationships, in, the, genus, apteryx, their, adaptation, to, a, terrestrial, life, is, extensive, like, all, the, other, ratites, ostrich, emu, rhea, and, cassowary, they, have, no, keel, on, the, sternum, to, anchor, wing, muscles, the, vestigial, wings, are, so, small, that, they, are, invisible, under, the, bristly, hair, like, two, branched, feathers, while, most, adult, birds, have, bones, with, hollow, insides, to, minimise, weight, and, make, flight, practicable, kiwi, have, marrow, like, mammals, and, the, young, of, other, birds, with, no, constraints, on, weight, due, to, flight, requirements, brown, kiwi, females, carry, and, lay, a, single, egg, that, may, weigh, as, much, as, 450, g, 16, oz, like, most, other, ratites, they, have, no, uropygial, gland, preen, gland, their, bill, is, long, pliable, and, sensitive, to, touch, and, their, eyes, have, a, reduced, pecten, their, feathers, lack, barbules, and, aftershafts, and, they, have, large, vibrissae, around, the, gape, they, have, 13, flight, feathers, no, tail, and, a, small, pygostyle, their, gizzard, is, weak, and, their, caecum, is, long, and, narrow, the, eye, of, the, kiwi, is, the, smallest, relative, to, body, mass, in, all, avian, species, resulting, in, the, smallest, visual, field, as, well, the, eye, has, small, specialisations, for, a, nocturnal, lifestyle, but, kiwi, rely, more, heavily, on, their, other, senses, auditory, olfactory, and, somatosensory, system, the, sight, of, the, kiwi, is, so, underdeveloped, that, blind, specimens, have, been, observed, in, nature, showing, how, little, they, rely, on, sight, for, survival, and, foraging, in, an, experiment, it, was, observed, that, one, third, of, a, population, of, a, rowi, in, new, zealand, under, no, environmental, stress, had, ocular, lesions, in, one, or, both, eyes, the, same, experiment, examined, three, specific, specimens, that, showed, complete, blindness, and, found, them, to, be, in, good, physical, standing, outside, of, ocular, abnormalities, a, 2018, study, revealed, that, the, kiwi, s, closest, relatives, the, extinct, elephant, birds, also, shared, this, trait, despite, their, great, size, unlike, virtually, every, other, palaeognath, which, are, generally, small, brained, by, bird, standards, kiwi, have, proportionally, large, encephalisation, quotients, hemisphere, proportions, are, even, similar, to, those, of, parrots, and, songbirds, though, there, is, no, evidence, of, similarly, complex, behaviour, before, the, arrival, of, humans, in, the, 13th, century, or, earlier, new, zealand, s, only, endemic, mammals, were, three, species, of, bat, and, the, ecological, niches, that, in, other, parts, of, the, world, were, filled, by, creatures, as, diverse, as, horses, wolves, and, mice, were, taken, up, by, birds, and, to, a, lesser, extent, reptiles, insects, and, gastropods, the, kiwi, s, mostly, nocturnal, habits, may, be, a, result, of, habitat, intrusion, by, predators, including, humans, in, areas, of, new, zealand, where, introduced, predators, have, been, removed, such, as, sanctuaries, kiwi, are, often, seen, in, daylight, they, prefer, subtropical, and, temperate, podocarp, and, beech, forests, but, they, are, being, forced, to, adapt, to, different, habitat, such, as, sub, alpine, scrub, tussock, grassland, and, the, mountains, kiwi, have, a, highly, developed, sense, of, smell, unusual, in, a, bird, and, are, the, only, birds, with, nostrils, at, the, end, of, their, long, beaks, kiwi, eat, small, invertebrates, seeds, grubs, and, many, varieties, of, worms, they, also, may, eat, fruit, small, crayfish, eels, and, amphibians, because, their, nostrils, are, located, at, the, end, of, their, long, beaks, kiwi, can, locate, insects, and, worms, underground, using, their, keen, sense, of, smell, without, actually, seeing, or, feeling, them, this, sense, of, smell, is, due, to, a, highly, developed, olfactory, chamber, and, surrounding, regions, it, is, a, common, belief, that, the, kiwi, relies, solely, on, its, sense, of, smell, to, catch, prey, but, this, has, not, been, scientifically, observed, lab, experiments, have, suggested, that, a, australis, can, rely, on, olfaction, alone, but, is, not, consistent, under, natural, conditions, instead, the, kiwi, may, rely, on, auditory, and, or, vibrotactile, cues, once, bonded, a, male, and, female, kiwi, tend, to, live, their, entire, lives, as, a, monogamous, couple, during, the, mating, season, june, to, march, the, pair, call, to, each, other, at, night, and, meet, in, the, nesting, burrow, every, three, days, these, relationships, may, last, for, up, to, 20, years, they, are, unusual, among, other, birds, in, that, along, with, some, raptors, they, have, a, functioning, pair, of, ovaries, in, most, birds, and, in, platypuses, the, right, ovary, never, matures, so, that, only, the, left, is, functional, kiwi, eggs, can, weigh, up, to, one, quarter, the, weight, of, the, female, usually, only, one, egg, is, laid, per, season, the, kiwi, lays, one, of, the, largest, eggs, in, proportion, to, its, size, of, any, bird, in, the, world, so, even, though, the, kiwi, is, about, the, size, of, a, domestic, chicken, it, is, able, to, lay, eggs, that, are, about, six, times, the, size, of, a, chicken, s, egg, the, eggs, are, smooth, in, texture, and, are, ivory, or, greenish, white, the, male, incubates, the, egg, except, for, the, great, spotted, kiwi, a, haastii, in, which, both, parents, are, involved, the, incubation, period, is, 63, 92, days, producing, the, huge, egg, places, significant, physiological, stress, on, the, female, for, the, thirty, days, it, takes, to, grow, the, fully, developed, egg, the, female, must, eat, three, times, her, normal, amount, of, food, two, to, three, days, before, the, egg, is, laid, there, is, little, space, left, inside, the, female, for, her, stomach, and, she, is, forced, to, fast, it, was, believed, that, the, large, eggs, were, a, trait, of, much, larger, moa, like, ancestors, and, that, kiwi, retained, large, eggs, as, an, evolutionarily, neutral, trait, as, they, became, smaller, however, research, in, the, early, 2010s, suggested, that, kiwi, were, descended, from, smaller, flighted, birds, that, flew, to, new, zealand, and, madagascar, where, they, gave, rise, to, kiwi, and, elephant, birds, the, large, egg, is, instead, thought, to, be, an, adaptation, for, precocity, enabling, kiwi, chicks, to, hatch, mobile, and, with, yolk, to, sustain, them, for, two, and, half, weeks, the, large, eggs, would, be, safe, in, new, zealand, s, historical, absence, of, egg, eating, ground, predators, while, the, mobile, chicks, would, be, able, to, evade, chick, eating, flying, predators, lice, in, the, genus, apterygon, and, in, the, subgenus, rallicola, aptericola, are, exclusively, ectoparasites, of, kiwi, species, nationwide, studies, show, that, only, around, 5, 10, of, kiwi, chicks, survive, to, adulthood, without, management, as, of, 2018, over, 70, of, kiwi, populations, are, unmanaged, however, in, areas, under, active, pest, management, survival, rates, for, north, island, brown, kiwi, can, be, far, higher, for, example, prior, to, a, joint, 1080, poison, operation, undertaken, by, doc, and, the, animal, health, board, in, tongariro, forest, in, 2006, 32, kiwi, chicks, were, radio, tagged, 57, of, the, radio, tagged, chicks, survived, to, adulthood, efforts, to, protect, kiwi, have, had, some, success, and, in, 2017, two, species, were, downlisted, from, endangered, to, vulnerable, by, the, iucn, in, 2018, the, department, of, conservation, released, its, current, kiwi, conservation, plan, in, 2000, the, department, of, conservation, set, up, five, kiwi, sanctuaries, focused, on, developing, methods, to, protect, kiwi, and, to, increase, their, numbers, a, number, of, other, mainland, conservation, islands, and, fenced, sanctuaries, have, significant, populations, of, kiwi, including, north, island, brown, kiwi, were, introduced, to, the, cape, sanctuary, in, hawke, s, bay, between, 2008, and, 2011, which, in, turn, provided, captive, raised, chicks, that, were, released, back, into, maungataniwha, native, forest, sanctuaries, for, kiwi, are, also, referred, to, as, k, hanga, sites, from, the, m, ori, word, for, nest, or, nursery, operation, nest, egg, is, a, programme, run, by, the, bnz, save, the, kiwi, trust, a, partnership, between, the, bank, of, new, zealand, the, department, of, conservation, and, the, royal, forest, and, bird, protection, society, kiwi, eggs, and, chicks, are, removed, from, the, wild, and, hatched, and, or, raised, in, captivity, until, big, enough, to, fend, for, themselves, usually, when, they, weigh, around, 1200, grams, 42, ounces, they, are, then, returned, to, the, wild, an, operation, nest, egg, bird, has, a, 65, chance, of, surviving, to, adulthood, compared, to, just, 5, for, wild, hatched, and, raised, chicks, the, tool, is, used, on, all, kiwi, species, except, little, spotted, kiwi, in, 2004, anti, 1080, activist, phillip, anderton, posed, for, the, new, zealand, media, with, a, kiwi, he, claimed, had, been, poisoned, an, investigation, revealed, that, anderton, lied, to, journalists, and, the, public, he, had, used, a, kiwi, that, had, been, caught, in, a, possum, trap, extensive, monitoring, shows, that, kiwi, are, not, at, risk, from, the, use, of, biodegradable, 1080, poison, introduced, mammalian, predators, namely, stoats, dogs, ferrets, and, cats, are, the, principal, threats, to, kiwi, the, biggest, threat, to, kiwi, chicks, is, stoats, while, dogs, are, the, biggest, threat, to, adult, kiwi, stoats, are, responsible, for, approximately, half, of, kiwi, chick, deaths, in, many, areas, through, new, zealand, young, kiwi, chicks, are, vulnerable, to, stoat, predation, until, they, reach, about, 1, 1, 2, kg, 2, 2, 2, 6, lb, in, weight, at, which, time, they, can, usually, defend, themselves, cats, also, to, a, lesser, extent, prey, on, kiwi, chicks, these, predators, can, cause, large, and, abrupt, declines, in, populations, in, particular, dogs, find, the, distinctive, strong, scent, of, kiwi, irresistible, and, easy, to, track, such, that, they, can, catch, and, kill, kiwi, in, seconds, motor, vehicle, strike, is, a, threat, to, all, kiwi, where, roads, cross, through, their, habitat, badly, set, possum, traps, often, kill, or, maim, kiwi, habitat, destruction, is, another, major, threat, to, kiwi, restricted, distribution, and, small, size, of, some, kiwi, populations, increases, their, vulnerability, to, inbreeding, research, has, shown, that, the, combined, effect, of, predators, and, other, mortality, accidents, etc, results, in, less, than, 5, of, kiwi, chicks, surviving, to, adulthood, the, m, ori, traditionally, believed, that, kiwi, were, under, the, protection, of, t, ne, mahuta, god, of, the, forest, they, were, used, as, food, and, their, feathers, were, used, for, kahu, kiwi, ceremonial, cloaks, today, while, kiwi, feathers, are, still, used, they, are, gathered, from, birds, that, die, naturally, through, road, accidents, or, predation, and, from, captive, birds, kiwi, are, no, longer, hunted, and, some, m, ori, consider, themselves, the, birds, guardians, in, 1813, george, shaw, named, the, genus, apteryx, in, his, species, description, of, the, southern, brown, kiwi, which, he, called, the, southern, apteryx, captain, andrew, barclay, of, the, ship, providence, provided, shaw, with, the, specimen, shaw, s, description, was, accompanied, by, two, plates, engraved, by, frederick, polydore, nodder, they, were, published, in, volume, 24, of, the, naturalist, s, miscellany, in, 1851, london, zoo, became, the, first, zoo, to, keep, kiwi, the, first, captive, breeding, took, place, in, 1945, as, of, 2007, only, 13, zoos, outside, new, zealand, hold, kiwi, the, frankfurt, zoo, has, 12, the, berlin, zoo, has, seven, walsrode, bird, park, has, one, the, avifauna, bird, park, in, the, netherlands, has, three, the, san,

columbus, zoo, and, aquarium, has, three, in, 2023, zoo, miami, apologized, for, mistreating, a, kiwi, after, footage, of, visitors, patting, the, nocturnal, bird, under, bright, lights, caused, outrage, in, new, zealand, the, kiwi, as, a, symbol, first, appeared, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, new, zealand, regimental, badges, it, was, later, featured, in, the, badges, of, the, south, canterbury, battalion, in, 1886, and, the, hastings, rifle, volunteers, in, 1887, soon, after, the, kiwi, appeared, in, many, military, badges, and, in, 1906, when, kiwi, shoe, polish, was, widely, sold, in, the, uk, and, the, us, the, symbol, became, more, widely, known, during, the, first, world, war, the, name, kiwis, for, new, zealand, soldiers, came, into, general, use, and, a, giant, kiwi, now, known, as, the, bulford, kiwi, was, carved, on, the, chalk, hill, above, sling, camp, in, england, usage, has, become, so, widespread, that, all, new, zealanders, overseas, and, at, home, are, now, commonly, referred, to, as, kiwis, the, kiwi, has, since, become, the, best, known, national, symbol, for, new, zealand, and, the, bird, is, prominent, in, the, coat, of, arms, crests, and, badges, of, many, new, zealand, cities, clubs, and, organisations, at, the, national, level, the, red, silhouette, of, a, kiwi, is, in, the, centre, of, the, roundel, of, the, royal, new, zealand, air, force, the, kiwi, is, featured, in, the, logo, of, the, new, zealand, rugby, league, and, the, new, zealand, national, rugby, league, team, are, nicknamed, the, kiwis, a, kiwi, has, featured, on, the, reverse, side, of, three, new, zealand, coins, the, one, florin, two, shilling, coin, from, 1933, to, 1966, the, twenty, cent, coin, from, 1967, to, 1990, and, the, one, dollar, coin, since, 1991, in, currency, trading, the, new, zealand, dollar, is, often, referred, to, as, the, kiwi, a, song, sticky, beak, the, kiwi, with, words, by, bob, edwards, and, music, by, neil, roberts, was, recorded, in, 1961, sung, by, julie, nelson, aged, 14, and, accompanied, by, the, satins, and, the, don, bell, orchestra, of, whang, rei, a, christmas, song, it, portrays, sticky, beak, as, insisting, on, pulling, santa, claus, s, sleigh, when, distributing, presents, south, of, the, equator, how, the, kiwi, lost, its, wings, is, a, fable, written, by, broadcaster, alwyn, owen, in, 1963, it, uses, elements, of, m, ori, mythology, such, as, t, ne, mahuta, and, the, world, war, i, symbol, of, cowardice, white, feathers, in, a, pourquoi, story, explaining, features, of, new, zealand, birds, owen, portrays, the, kiwi, as, nobly, sacrificing, its, wings, and, flight, in, order, to, protect, the, trees, from, depredation, by, ground, dwelling, creatures, and, thereby, winning, its, unique, renown, owen, s, story, is, sometimes, described, as, a, maori, legend, it, has, been, recorded, as, a, children, s, story, published, as, a, book, was, made, into, an, animated, film, in, 1980, set, to, music, for, the, auckland, philharmonia, orchestra, by, thomas, goss, as, t, ne, and, the, kiwi, in, 2002, recorded, for, rnz, by, orchestra, wellington, in, 2008, and, performed, as, a, ballet, by, the, royal, new, zealand, ballet, in, 2022
