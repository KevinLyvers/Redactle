see, text, the, nematodes, n, m, t, o, d, z, nem, tohdz, or, neem, greek, latin, nematoda, roundworms, or, eelworms, constitute, the, phylum, nematoda, they, are, a, diverse, animal, phylum, inhabiting, a, broad, range, of, environments, most, species, are, free, living, feeding, on, microorganisms, but, many, species, are, parasitic, the, parasitic, worms, helminths, are, the, cause, of, soil, transmitted, helminthiases, they, are, taxonomically, classified, along, with, arthropods, tardigrades, and, other, moulting, animals, in, the, clade, ecdysozoa, unlike, the, vaguely, similar, flatworms, nematodes, have, a, tubular, digestive, system, with, openings, at, both, ends, like, tardigrades, they, have, a, reduced, number, of, hox, genes, but, their, sister, phylum, nematomorpha, has, kept, the, ancestral, protostome, hox, genotype, which, shows, that, the, reduction, has, occurred, within, the, nematode, phylum, nematode, species, can, be, difficult, to, distinguish, from, one, another, consequently, estimates, of, the, number, of, nematode, species, are, uncertain, a, 2013, survey, of, animal, biodiversity, published, in, the, mega, journal, zootaxa, puts, this, figure, at, over, 25, 000, estimates, of, the, total, number, of, extant, species, are, subject, to, even, greater, variation, a, widely, referenced, article, published, in, 1993, estimated, there, may, be, over, 1, million, species, of, nematode, a, subsequent, publication, challenged, this, claim, estimating, the, figure, to, be, at, least, 40, 000, species, although, the, highest, estimates, up, to, 100, million, species, have, since, been, deprecated, estimates, supported, by, rarefaction, curves, together, with, the, use, of, dna, barcoding, and, the, increasing, acknowledgment, of, widespread, cryptic, species, among, nematodes, have, placed, the, figure, closer, to, 1, million, species, nematodes, have, successfully, adapted, to, nearly, every, ecosystem, from, marine, salt, to, fresh, water, soils, from, the, polar, regions, to, the, tropics, as, well, as, the, highest, to, the, lowest, of, elevations, they, are, ubiquitous, in, freshwater, marine, and, terrestrial, environments, where, they, often, outnumber, other, animals, in, both, individual, and, species, counts, and, are, found, in, locations, as, diverse, as, mountains, deserts, and, oceanic, trenches, they, are, found, in, every, part, of, the, earth, s, lithosphere, even, at, great, depths, 0, 9, 3, 6, km, 3, 000, 12, 000, ft, below, the, surface, of, the, earth, in, gold, mines, in, south, africa, they, represent, 90, of, all, animals, on, the, ocean, floor, in, total, 4, 4, 10, 20, nematodes, inhabit, the, earth, s, topsoil, or, approximately, 60, billion, for, each, human, with, the, highest, densities, observed, in, tundra, and, boreal, forests, their, numerical, dominance, often, exceeding, a, million, individuals, per, square, meter, and, accounting, for, about, 80, of, all, individual, animals, on, earth, their, diversity, of, lifecycles, and, their, presence, at, various, trophic, levels, point, to, an, important, role, in, many, ecosystems, they, have, been, shown, to, play, crucial, roles, in, polar, ecosystems, the, roughly, 2, 271, genera, are, placed, in, 256, families, the, many, parasitic, forms, include, pathogens, in, most, plants, and, animals, a, third, of, the, genera, occur, as, parasites, of, vertebrates, about, 35, nematode, species, occur, in, humans, nathan, cobb, a, nematologist, described, the, ubiquity, of, nematodes, on, earth, thus, in, short, if, all, the, matter, in, the, universe, except, the, nematodes, were, swept, away, our, world, would, still, be, dimly, recognizable, and, if, as, disembodied, spirits, we, could, then, investigate, it, we, should, find, its, mountains, hills, vales, rivers, lakes, and, oceans, represented, by, a, film, of, nematodes, the, location, of, towns, would, be, decipherable, since, for, every, massing, of, human, beings, there, would, be, a, corresponding, massing, of, certain, nematodes, trees, would, still, stand, in, ghostly, rows, representing, our, streets, and, highways, the, location, of, the, various, plants, and, animals, would, still, be, decipherable, and, had, we, sufficient, knowledge, in, many, cases, even, their, species, could, be, determined, by, an, examination, of, their, erstwhile, nematode, parasites, p, 472, the, word, nematode, comes, from, the, modern, latin, compound, of, nemat, thread, from, greek, nema, genitive, nematos, thread, from, stem, of, nein, to, spin, see, needle, odes, like, of, the, nature, of, see, oid, in, 1758, linnaeus, described, some, nematode, genera, e, g, ascaris, then, included, in, the, vermes, the, name, of, the, group, nematoda, informally, called, nematodes, came, from, nematoidea, originally, defined, by, karl, rudolphi, 1808, from, ancient, greek, n, ma, n, matos, thread, and, eid, s, species, it, was, treated, as, family, nematodes, by, burmeister, 1837, at, its, origin, the, nematoidea, erroneously, included, nematodes, and, nematomorpha, attributed, by, von, siebold, 1843, along, with, acanthocephala, trematoda, and, cestoidea, it, formed, the, obsolete, group, entozoa, created, by, rudolphi, 1808, they, were, also, classed, along, with, acanthocephala, in, the, obsolete, phylum, nemathelminthes, by, gegenbaur, 1859, in, 1861, k, m, diesing, treated, the, group, as, order, nematoda, in, 1877, the, taxon, nematoidea, including, the, family, gordiidae, horsehair, worms, was, promoted, to, the, rank, of, phylum, by, ray, lankester, the, first, clear, distinction, between, the, nemas, and, gordiids, was, realized, by, vejdovsky, when, he, named, a, group, to, contain, the, horsehair, worms, the, order, nematomorpha, in, 1919, nathan, cobb, proposed, that, nematodes, should, be, recognized, alone, as, a, phylum, he, argued, they, should, be, called, nema, in, english, rather, than, nematodes, and, defined, the, taxon, nemates, later, emended, as, nemata, latin, plural, of, nema, listing, nematoidea, sensu, restricto, as, a, synonym, however, in, 1910, grobben, proposed, the, phylum, aschelminthes, and, the, nematodes, were, included, as, class, nematoda, along, with, class, rotifera, class, gastrotricha, class, kinorhyncha, class, priapulida, and, class, nematomorpha, the, phylum, was, later, revived, and, modified, by, libbie, henrietta, hyman, in, 1951, as, pseudoceolomata, but, remained, similar, in, 1932, potts, elevated, the, class, nematoda, to, the, level, of, phylum, leaving, the, name, the, same, despite, potts, classification, being, equivalent, to, cobbs, both, names, have, been, used, and, are, still, used, today, and, nematode, became, a, popular, term, in, zoological, science, since, cobb, was, the, first, to, include, nematodes, in, a, particular, phylum, separated, from, nematomorpha, some, researchers, consider, the, valid, taxon, name, to, be, nemates, or, nemata, rather, than, nematoda, because, of, the, zoological, rule, that, gives, priority, to, the, first, used, term, in, case, of, synonyms, the, phylogenetic, relationships, of, the, nematodes, and, their, close, relatives, among, the, protostomian, metazoa, are, unresolved, traditionally, they, were, held, to, be, a, lineage, of, their, own, but, in, the, 1990s, they, were, proposed, to, form, the, group, ecdysozoa, together, with, moulting, animals, such, as, arthropods, the, identity, of, the, closest, living, relatives, of, the, nematoda, has, always, been, considered, to, be, well, resolved, morphological, characters, and, molecular, phylogenies, agree, with, placement, of, the, roundworms, as, a, sister, taxon, to, the, parasitic, nematomorpha, together, they, make, up, the, nematoida, along, with, the, scalidophora, formerly, cephalorhyncha, the, nematoida, form, the, clade, cycloneuralia, but, much, disagreement, occurs, both, between, and, among, the, available, morphological, and, molecular, data, the, cycloneuralia, or, the, introverta, depending, on, the, validity, of, the, former, are, often, ranked, as, a, superphylum, for, an, up, to, date, view, as, of, 2022, see, phylogenomic, analysis, of, the, phylum, nematoda, conflicts, and, congruences, with, morphology, 18s, rrna, and, mitogenomes, due, to, the, lack, of, knowledge, regarding, many, nematodes, their, systematics, is, contentious, an, early, and, influential, classification, was, proposed, by, chitwood, and, chitwood, later, revised, by, chitwood, who, divided, the, phylum, into, two, classes, aphasmidia, and, phasmidia, these, were, later, renamed, adenophorea, gland, bearers, and, secernentea, secretors, respectively, the, secernentea, share, several, characteristics, including, the, presence, of, phasmids, a, pair, of, sensory, organs, located, in, the, lateral, posterior, region, and, this, was, used, as, the, basis, for, this, division, this, scheme, was, adhered, to, in, many, later, classifications, though, the, adenophorea, were, not, in, a, uniform, group, initial, studies, of, incomplete, dna, sequences, suggested, the, existence, of, five, clades, the, secernentea, seem, to, be, a, natural, group, of, close, relatives, while, the, adenophorea, appear, to, be, a, paraphyletic, assemblage, of, roundworms, that, retain, a, good, number, of, ancestral, traits, the, old, enoplia, do, not, seem, to, be, monophyletic, either, but, do, contain, two, distinct, lineages, the, old, group, chromadoria, seems, to, be, another, paraphyletic, assemblage, with, the, monhysterida, representing, a, very, ancient, minor, group, of, nematodes, among, the, secernentea, the, diplogasteria, may, need, to, be, united, with, the, rhabditia, while, the, tylenchia, might, be, paraphyletic, with, the, rhabditia, the, understanding, of, roundworm, systematics, and, phylogeny, as, of, 2002, is, summarised, below, phylum, nematoda, later, work, has, suggested, the, presence, of, 12, clades, the, secernentea, a, group, that, includes, virtually, all, major, animal, and, plant, nematode, parasites, apparently, arose, from, within, the, adenophorea, in, 2019, a, study, identified, one, conserved, signature, indel, csi, found, exclusively, in, members, of, the, phylum, nematoda, through, comparative, genetic, analyses, the, csi, consists, of, a, single, amino, acid, insertion, within, a, conserved, region, of, a, na, h, exchange, regulatory, factor, protein, nrfl, 1, and, is, a, molecular, marker, that, distinguishes, the, phylum, from, other, species, a, major, effort, by, a, collaborative, wiki, called, 959, nematode, genomes, is, underway, to, improve, the, systematics, of, this, phylum, an, analysis, of, the, mitochondrial, dna, suggests, that, the, following, groupings, are, valid, in, 2022, a, new, classification, of, the, entire, phylum, nematoda, was, presented, by, m, hodda, it, was, based, on, current, molecular, developmental, and, morphological, evidence, under, this, classification, the, following, classes, and, subclasses, are, presented, nematode, eggs, from, the, clades, ascaridina, spirurina, and, trichocephalida, have, been, discovered, in, coprolites, from, the, oligocene, aged, trememb, formation, which, represented, a, palaeolake, in, present, day, s, o, paulo, with, a, diverse, fossil, assemblage, of, birds, fish, and, arthropods, that, lent, itself, to, fostering, high, nematode, diversity, nematodes, are, very, small, slender, worms, typically, about, 5, to, 100, m, thick, and, 0, 1, to, 2, 5, mm, long, the, smallest, nematodes, are, microscopic, while, free, living, species, can, reach, as, much, as, 5, cm, 2, in, and, some, parasitic, species, are, larger, still, reaching, over, 1, m, 3, ft, in, length, 271, the, body, is, often, ornamented, with, ridges, rings, bristles, or, other, distinctive, structures, the, head, of, a, nematode, is, relatively, distinct, whereas, the, rest, of, the, body, is, bilaterally, symmetrical, the, head, is, radially, symmetrical, with, sensory, bristles, and, in, many, cases, solid, head, shields, radiating, outwards, around, the, mouth, the, mouth, has, either, three, or, six, lips, which, often, bear, a, series, of, teeth, on, their, inner, edges, an, adhesive, caudal, gland, is, often, found, at, the, tip, of, the, tail, the, epidermis, is, either, a, syncytium, or, a, single, layer, of, cells, and, is, covered, by, a, thick, collagenous, cuticle, the, cuticle, is, often, of, a, complex, structure, and, may, have, two, or, three, distinct, layers, underneath, the, epidermis, lies, a, layer, of, longitudinal, muscle, cells, the, relatively, rigid, cuticle, works, with, the, muscles, to, create, a, hydroskeleton, as, nematodes, lack, circumferential, muscles, projections, run, from, the, inner, surface, of, muscle, cells, towards, the, nerve, cords, this, is, a, unique, arrangement, in, the, animal, kingdom, in, which, nerve, cells, normally, extend, fibers, into, the, muscles, rather, than, vice, versa, the, oral, cavity, is, lined, with, cuticles, which, are, often, strengthened, with, structures, such, as, ridges, especially, in, carnivorous, species, which, may, bear, several, teeth, the, mouth, often, includes, a, sharp, stylet, which, the, animal, can, thrust, into, its, prey, in, some, species, the, style, is, hollow, and, can, be, used, to, suck, liquids, from, plants, or, animals, the, oral, cavity, opens, into, a, muscular, sucking, pharynx, also, lined, with, cuticle, digestive, glands, are, found, in, this, region, of, the, gut, producing, enzymes, that, start, to, break, down, the, food, in, stylet, bearing, species, these, may, even, be, injected, into, the, prey, no, stomach, is, present, with, the, pharynx, connecting, directly, to, a, muscleless, intestine, that, forms, the, main, length, of, the, gut, this, produces, further, enzymes, and, also, absorbs, nutrients, through, its, single, cell, thick, lining, the, last, portion, of, the, intestine, is, lined, by, a, cuticle, forming, a, rectum, which, expels, waste, through, the, anus, just, below, and, in, front, of, the, tip, of, the, tail, the, movement, of, food, through, the, digestive, system, is, the, result, of, the, body, movements, of, the, worm, the, intestine, has, valves, or, sphincters, at, either, end, to, help, control, food, movement, through, the, body, nitrogenous, waste, is, excreted, in, the, form, of, ammonia, through, the, body, wall, and, is, not, associated, with, any, specific, organs, however, the, structures, for, excreting, salt, to, maintain, osmoregulation, are, typically, more, complex, in, many, marine, nematodes, one, or, two, unicellular, renette, glands, excrete, salt, through, a, pore, on, the, underside, of, the, animal, close, to, the, pharynx, in, most, other, nematodes, these, specialized, cells, have, been, replaced, by, an, organ, consisting, of, two, parallel, ducts, connected, by, a, single, transverse, duct, this, transverse, duct, opens, into, a, common, canal, that, runs, to, the, excretory, pore, at, the, anterior, end, of, the, animal, a, dense, circular, nerve, ring, which, serves, as, the, brain, surrounds, the, pharynx, from, this, ring, six, labial, papillary, nerve, cords, extend, anteriorly, while, six, nerve, cords, a, large, ventral, a, smaller, dorsal, and, two, pairs, of, sublateral, cords, extend, posteriorly, each, nerve, lies, within, a, cord, of, connective, tissue, lying, beneath, the, cuticle, and, between, the, muscle, cells, the, ventral, nerve, is, the, largest, and, has, a, double, structure, forward, of, the, excretory, pore, the, dorsal, nerve, is, responsible, for, motor, control, while, the, lateral, nerves, are, sensory, and, the, ventral, combines, both, functions, the, nervous, system, is, also, the, only, place, in, the, nematode, body, that, contains, cilia, which, are, all, nonmotile, and, with, a, sensory, function, the, bodies, of, nematodes, are, covered, in, numerous, sensory, bristles, and, papillae, that, together, provide, a, sense, of, touch, behind, the, sensory, bristles, on, the, head, lie, two, small, pits, or, amphids, these, are, well, supplied, with, nerve, cells, and, are, probably, chemoreception, organs, a, few, aquatic, nematodes, possess, what, appear, to, be, pigmented, eye, spots, but, whether, or, not, these, are, actually, sensory, in, nature, is, unclear, most, nematode, species, are, dioecious, with, separate, male, and, female, individuals, though, some, such, as, caenorhabditis, elegans, are, androdioecious, consisting, of, hermaphrodites, and, rare, males, both, sexes, possess, one, or, two, tubular, gonads, in, males, the, sperm, are, produced, at, the, end, of, the, gonad, and, migrate, along, its, length, as, they, mature, the, testis, opens, into, a, relatively, wide, seminal, vesicle, and, then, during, intercourse, into, a, glandular, and, muscular, ejaculatory, duct, associated, with, the, vas, deferens, and, cloaca, in, females, the, ovaries, each, open, into, an, oviduct, in, hermaphrodites, the, eggs, enter, a, spermatheca, first, and, then, a, glandular, uterus, the, uteri, both, open, into, a, common, vulva, vagina, usually, located, in, the, middle, of, the, morphologically, ventral, surface, reproduction, is, usually, sexual, though, hermaphrodites, are, capable, of, self, fertilization, males, are, usually, smaller, than, females, or, hermaphrodites, often, much, smaller, and, often, have, a, characteristically, bent, or, fan, shaped, tail, during, copulation, one, or, more, chitinized, spicules, move, out, of, the, cloaca, and, are, inserted, into, the, genital, pore, of, the, female, amoeboid, sperm, crawl, along, the, spicule, into, the, female, worm, nematode, sperm, is, thought, to, be, the, only, eukaryotic, cell, without, the, globular, protein, g, actin, eggs, may, be, embryonated, or, unembryonated, when, passed, by, the, female, meaning, their, fertilized, eggs, may, not, yet, be, developed, a, few, species, are, known, to, be, ovoviviparous, the, eggs, are, protected, by, an, outer, shell, secreted, by, the, uterus, in, free, living, roundworms, the, eggs, hatch, into, larvae, which, appear, essentially, identical, to, the, adults, except, for, an, underdeveloped, reproductive, system, in, parasitic, roundworms, the, lifecycle, is, often, much, more, complicated, the, structure, of, the, eggshell, is, complicated, and, includes, several, layers, a, detailed, anatomical, and, terminological, framework, has, been, proposed, for, these, layers, in, 2023, nematodes, as, a, whole, possess, a, wide, range, of, modes, of, reproduction, some, nematodes, such, as, heterorhabditis, spp, undergo, a, process, called, endotokia, matricida, intrauterine, birth, causing, maternal, death, some, nematodes, are, hermaphroditic, and, keep, their, self, fertilized, eggs, inside, the, uterus, until, they, hatch, the, juvenile, nematodes, then, ingest, the, parent, nematode, this, process, is, significantly, promoted, in, environments, with, a, low, food, supply, the, nematode, model, species, c, elegans, c, briggsae, and, pristionchus, pacificus, among, other, species, exhibit, androdioecy, which, is, otherwise, very, rare, among, animals, the, single, genus, meloidogyne, root, knot, nematodes, exhibits, a, range, of, reproductive, modes, including, sexual, reproduction, facultative, sexuality, in, which, most, but, not, all, generations, reproduce, asexually, and, both, meiotic, and, mitotic, parthenogenesis, the, genus, mesorhabditis, exhibits, an, unusual, form, of, parthenogenesis, in, which, sperm, producing, males, copulate, with, females, but, the, sperm, do, not, fuse, with, the, ovum, contact, with, the, sperm, is, essential, for, the, ovum, to, begin, dividing, but, because, no, fusion, of, the, cells, occurs, the, male, contributes, no, genetic, material, to, the, offspring, which, are, essentially, clones, of, the, female, the, nematode, caenorhabditis, elegans, is, often, used, as, a, model, organism, for, studying, aging, at, the, molecular, level, for, example, in, c, elegans, aging, negatively, impacts, dna, repair, and, mutants, of, c, elegans, that, are, long, lived, were, shown, to, have, increased, dna, repair, capability, these, findings, suggest, a, genetically, determined, correlation, between, dna, repair, capacity, and, lifespan, in, female, c, elegans, germline, processes, that, control, dna, repair, and, formation, of, chromosomal, crossovers, during, meiosis, were, shown, to, progressively, deteriorate, with, age, different, free, living, species, feed, on, materials, as, varied, as, bacteria, algae, fungi, small, animals, fecal, matter, dead, organisms, and, living, tissues, free, living, marine, nematodes, are, important, and, abundant, members, of, the, meiobenthos, they, play, an, important, role, in, the, decomposition, process, aid, in, recycling, of, nutrients, in, marine, environments, and, are, sensitive, to, changes, in, the, environment, caused, by, pollution, one, roundworm, of, note, c, elegans, lives, in, the, soil, and, has, found, much, use, as, a, model, organism, c, elegans, has, had, its, entire, genome, sequenced, the, developmental, fate, of, every, cell, determined, and, every, neuron, mapped, nematodes, that, commonly, parasitise, humans, include, ascarids, ascaris, filarias, hookworms, pinworms, enterobius, and, whipworms, trichuris, trichiura, the, species, trichinella, spiralis, commonly, known, as, the, trichina, worm, occurs, in, rats, pigs, bears, and, humans, and, is, responsible, for, the, disease, trichinosis, baylisascaris, usually, infests, wild, animals, but, can, be, deadly, to, humans, as, well, dirofilaria, immitis, is, known, for, causing, heartworm, disease, by, inhabiting, the, hearts, arteries, and, lungs, of, dogs, and, some, cats, haemonchus, contortus, is, one, of, the, most, abundant, infectious, agents, in, sheep, around, the, world, causing, great, economic, damage, to, sheep, in, contrast, entomopathogenic, nematodes, parasitize, insects, and, are, mostly, considered, beneficial, by, humans, but, some, attack, beneficial, insects, one, form, of, nematode, is, entirely, dependent, upon, fig, wasps, which, are, the, sole, source, of, fig, fertilization, they, prey, upon, the, wasps, riding, them, from, the, ripe, fig, of, the, wasp, s, birth, to, the, fig, flower, of, its, death, where, they, kill, the, wasp, and, their, offspring, await, the, birth, of, the, next, generation, of, wasps, as, the, fig, ripens, a, parasitic, tetradonematid, nematode, discovered, in, 2005, myrmeconema, neotropicum, induces, fruit, mimicry, in, the, tropical, ant, cephalotes, atratus, infected, ants, develop, bright, red, gasters, abdomens, tend, to, be, more, sluggish, and, walk, with, their, gasters, in, a, conspicuous, elevated, position, these, changes, likely, cause, frugivorous, birds, to, confuse, the, infected, ants, for, berries, and, eat, them, parasite, eggs, passed, in, the, bird, s, feces, are, subsequently, collected, by, foraging, c, atratus, and, are, fed, to, their, larvae, thus, completing, the, lifecycle, of, m, neotropicum, similarly, multiple, varieties, of, nematodes, have, been, found, in, the, abdominal, cavities, of, the, primitively, social, sweat, bee, lasioglossum, zephyrus, inside, the, female, body, the, nematode, hinders, ovarian, development, and, renders, the, bee, less, active, thus, less, effective, in, pollen, collection, depending, on, its, species, a, nematode, may, be, beneficial, or, detrimental, to, plant, health, from, agricultural, and, horticulture, perspectives, the, two, categories, of, nematodes, are, the, predatory, ones, which, kill, garden, pests, and, the, pest, nematodes, which, attack, plants, or, act, as, vectors, spreading, plant, viruses, between, crop, plants, predatory, nematodes, include, phasmarhabditis, hermaphrodita, which, is, a, lethal, parasite, of, gastropods, such, as, slugs, and, snails, some, members, of, the, genus, steinernema, such, as, steinernema, carpocapsae, and, steinernema, riobrave, are, generalist, parasites, of, webworms, cutworms, armyworms, girdlers, some, weevils, wood, borers, and, corn, earworm, moths, these, organisms, are, grown, commercially, as, biological, pest, control, agents, which, can, be, used, as, an, alternative, to, pesticides, their, use, is, considered, very, safe, plant, parasitic, nematodes, include, several, groups, causing, severe, crop, losses, taking, 10, of, crops, worldwide, every, year, the, most, common, genera, are, aphelenchoides, foliar, nematodes, ditylenchus, globodera, potato, cyst, nematodes, heterodera, soybean, cyst, nematodes, longidorus, meloidogyne, root, knot, nematodes, nacobbus, pratylenchus, lesion, nematodes, trichodorus, and, xiphinema, dagger, nematodes, several, phytoparasitic, nematode, species, cause, histological, damages, to, roots, including, the, formation, of, visible, galls, e, g, by, root, knot, nematodes, which, are, useful, characters, for, their, diagnostic, in, the, field, some, nematode, species, transmit, plant, viruses, through, their, feeding, activity, on, roots, one, of, them, is, xiphinema, index, vector, of, grapevine, fanleaf, virus, an, important, disease, of, grapes, another, one, is, xiphinema, diversicaudatum, vector, of, arabis, mosaic, virus, other, nematodes, attack, bark, and, forest, trees, the, most, important, representative, of, this, group, is, bursaphelenchus, xylophilus, the, pine, wood, nematode, present, in, asia, and, america, and, recently, discovered, in, europe, this, nematode, is, transmitted, from, tree, to, tree, by, sawyer, beetles, monochamus, greenhouse, growers, use, beneficial, nematodes, to, control, fungus, gnats, the, nematodes, enter, the, larva, of, the, gnats, by, way, of, their, anus, mouth, and, spiracles, breathing, pores, and, then, release, a, bacteria, which, kills, the, gnat, larvae, commonly, used, nematode, species, to, control, pests, on, greenhouse, crops, include, steinernema, feltiae, for, fungus, gnats, and, western, flower, thrips, steinernema, carpocapsae, used, to, control, shore, flies, steinernema, kraussei, for, control, of, black, vine, weevils, and, heterorhabditis, bacteriophora, to, control, beetle, larvae, rotations, of, plants, with, nematode, resistant, species, or, varieties, is, one, means, of, managing, parasitic, nematode, infestations, for, example, planting, tagetes, marigolds, as, a, cover, crop, just, prior, to, planting, a, nematode, susceptible, plant, has, been, shown, to, suppress, nematodes, another, is, treatment, with, natural, antagonists, such, as, the, fungus, gliocladium, roseum, chitosan, a, natural, biocontrol, elicits, plant, defense, responses, to, destroy, parasitic, cyst, nematodes, on, roots, of, soybean, corn, sugar, beet, potato, and, tomato, crops, without, harming, beneficial, nematodes, in, the, soil, soil, steaming, is, an, efficient, method, to, kill, nematodes, before, planting, a, crop, but, indiscriminately, eliminates, both, harmful, and, beneficial, soil, fauna, the, golden, nematode, globodera, rostochiensis, is, a, particularly, harmful, variety, of, nematode, pest, that, has, resulted, in, quarantines, and, crop, failures, worldwide, csiro, has, found, a, 13, to, 14, fold, reduction, of, nematode, population, densities, in, plots, having, chinese, mustard, brassica, juncea, green, manure, or, seed, meal, in, the, soil, a, number, of, intestinal, nematodes, cause, diseases, affecting, human, beings, including, ascariasis, trichuriasis, and, hookworm, disease, filarial, nematodes, cause, filariases, furthermore, studies, have, shown, that, parasitic, nematodes, infect, american, eels, causing, damage, to, the, eel, s, swim, bladder, dairy, animals, like, cattle, and, buffalo, and, all, species, of, sheep, gastrointestinal, nematode, infections, in, humans, are, common, with, approximately, 50, of, the, global, population, being, affected, developing, countries, are, most, heavily, impacted, in, part, due, to, lack, of, access, to, medical, care, about, 90, of, nematodes, reside, in, the, top, 15, cm, 6, of, soil, nematodes, do, not, decompose, organic, matter, but, instead, are, parasitic, and, free, living, organisms, that, feed, on, living, material, nematodes, can, effectively, regulate, bacterial, population, and, community, composition, they, may, eat, up, to, 5, 000, bacteria, per, minute, also, nematodes, can, play, an, important, role, in, the, nitrogen, cycle, by, way, of, nitrogen, mineralization, one, group, of, carnivorous, fungi, the, nematophagous, fungi, are, predators, of, soil, nematodes, they, set, enticements, for, the, nematodes, in, the, form, of, lassos, or, adhesive, structures, nematode, worms, c, elegans, part, of, an, ongoing, research, project, conducted, on, the, 2003, space, shuttle, columbia, mission, sts, 107, survived, the, re, entry, breakup, it, is, believed, to, be, the, first, known, life, form, to, survive, a, virtually, unprotected, atmospheric, descent, to, earth, s, surface, in, a, research, project, published, in, 2012, it, was, found, that, the, antarctic, nematodes, p, davidi, was, able, to, withstand, intracellular, freezing, depending, on, how, well, it, was, fed, in, 2023, it, was, reported, that, an, individual, of, panagrolaimus, kolymaensis, had, been, revived, after, 46, 000, years, in, siberian, permafrost
