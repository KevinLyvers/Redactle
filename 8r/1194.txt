the, haptophytes, classified, either, as, the, haptophyta, haptophytina, or, prymnesiophyta, named, for, prymnesium, are, a, clade, of, algae, the, names, haptophyceae, or, prymnesiophyceae, are, sometimes, used, instead, this, ending, implies, classification, at, the, class, rank, rather, than, as, a, division, although, the, phylogenetics, of, this, group, has, become, much, better, understood, in, recent, years, there, remains, some, dispute, over, which, rank, is, most, appropriate, the, chloroplasts, are, pigmented, similarly, to, those, of, the, heterokonts, but, the, structure, of, the, rest, of, the, cell, is, different, so, it, may, be, that, they, are, a, separate, line, whose, chloroplasts, are, derived, from, similar, red, algal, endosymbionts, the, cells, typically, have, two, slightly, unequal, flagella, both, of, which, are, smooth, and, a, unique, organelle, called, a, haptonema, which, is, superficially, similar, to, a, flagellum, but, differs, in, the, arrangement, of, microtubules, and, in, its, use, the, name, comes, from, the, greek, hapsis, touch, and, nema, round, thread, the, mitochondria, have, tubular, cristae, the, best, known, haptophytes, are, coccolithophores, which, make, up, 673, of, the, 762, described, haptophyte, species, and, have, an, exoskeleton, of, calcareous, plates, called, coccoliths, coccolithophores, are, some, of, the, most, abundant, marine, phytoplankton, especially, in, the, open, ocean, and, are, extremely, abundant, as, microfossils, forming, chalk, deposits, other, planktonic, haptophytes, of, note, include, chrysochromulina, and, prymnesium, which, periodically, form, toxic, marine, algal, blooms, and, phaeocystis, blooms, of, which, can, produce, unpleasant, foam, which, often, accumulates, on, beaches, haptophytes, are, economically, important, as, species, such, as, pavlova, lutheri, and, isochrysis, sp, are, widely, used, in, the, aquaculture, industry, to, feed, oyster, and, shrimp, larvae, they, contain, a, large, amount, of, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, such, as, docosahexaenoic, acid, dha, stearidonic, acid, and, alpha, linolenic, acid, tisochrysis, lutea, contains, betain, lipids, and, phospholipids, the, haptophytes, were, first, placed, in, the, class, chrysophyceae, golden, algae, but, ultrastructural, data, have, provided, evidence, to, classify, them, separately, both, molecular, and, morphological, evidence, supports, their, division, into, five, orders, coccolithophores, make, up, the, isochrysidales, and, coccolithales, very, small, 2, 3, m, uncultured, pico, prymnesiophytes, are, ecologically, important, haptophytes, was, discussed, to, be, closely, related, to, cryptomonads, haptophytes, are, closely, related, to, the, sar, clade, subphylum, haptophytina, cavalier, smith, 2015
