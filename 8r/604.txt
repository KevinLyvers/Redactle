archaeopteryx, r, k, i, p, t, r, k, s, lit, old, wing, sometimes, referred, to, by, its, german, name, urvogel, lit, primeval, bird, is, a, genus, of, bird, like, dinosaurs, the, name, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, archa, os, meaning, ancient, and, pt, ryx, meaning, feather, or, wing, between, the, late, 19th, century, and, the, early, 21st, century, archaeopteryx, was, generally, accepted, by, palaeontologists, and, popular, reference, books, as, the, oldest, known, bird, member, of, the, group, avialae, older, potential, avialans, have, since, been, identified, including, anchiornis, xiaotingia, and, aurornis, archaeopteryx, lived, in, the, late, jurassic, around, 150, million, years, ago, in, what, is, now, southern, germany, during, a, time, when, europe, was, an, archipelago, of, islands, in, a, shallow, warm, tropical, sea, much, closer, to, the, equator, than, it, is, now, similar, in, size, to, a, eurasian, magpie, with, the, largest, individuals, possibly, attaining, the, size, of, a, raven, the, largest, species, of, archaeopteryx, could, grow, to, about, 0, 5, m, 1, ft, 8, in, in, length, despite, their, small, size, broad, wings, and, inferred, ability, to, fly, or, glide, archaeopteryx, had, more, in, common, with, other, small, mesozoic, dinosaurs, than, with, modern, birds, in, particular, they, shared, the, following, features, with, the, dromaeosaurids, and, troodontids, jaws, with, sharp, teeth, three, fingers, with, claws, a, long, bony, tail, hyperextensible, second, toes, killing, claw, feathers, which, also, suggest, warm, bloodedness, and, various, features, of, the, skeleton, these, features, make, archaeopteryx, a, clear, candidate, for, a, transitional, fossil, between, non, avian, dinosaurs, and, avian, dinosaurs, birds, thus, archaeopteryx, plays, an, important, role, not, only, in, the, study, of, the, origin, of, birds, but, in, the, study, of, dinosaurs, it, was, named, from, a, single, feather, in, 1861, the, identity, of, which, has, been, controversial, that, same, year, the, first, complete, specimen, of, archaeopteryx, was, announced, over, the, years, eleven, more, fossils, of, archaeopteryx, have, surfaced, despite, variation, among, these, fossils, most, experts, regard, all, the, remains, that, have, been, discovered, as, belonging, to, a, single, species, although, this, is, still, debated, most, of, these, twelve, fossils, include, impressions, of, feathers, because, these, feathers, are, of, an, advanced, form, flight, feathers, these, fossils, are, evidence, that, the, evolution, of, feathers, began, before, the, late, jurassic, the, type, specimen, of, archaeopteryx, was, discovered, just, two, years, after, charles, darwin, published, on, the, origin, of, species, archaeopteryx, seemed, to, confirm, darwin, s, theories, and, has, since, become, a, key, piece, of, evidence, for, the, origin, of, birds, the, transitional, fossils, debate, and, confirmation, of, evolution, archaeopteryx, was, long, considered, to, be, the, beginning, of, the, evolutionary, tree, of, birds, however, in, recent, years, the, discovery, of, several, small, feathered, dinosaurs, has, created, a, mystery, for, palaeontologists, raising, questions, about, which, animals, are, the, ancestors, of, modern, birds, and, which, are, their, relatives, over, the, years, twelve, body, fossil, specimens, of, archaeopteryx, have, been, found, all, of, the, fossils, come, from, the, limestone, deposits, quarried, for, centuries, near, solnhofen, germany, these, quarries, excavate, sediments, from, the, solnhofen, limestone, formation, and, related, units, the, initial, specimen, was, the, first, dinosaur, to, be, discovered, with, feathers, the, initial, discovery, a, single, feather, was, unearthed, in, 1860, or, 1861, and, described, in, 1861, by, hermann, von, meyer, it, is, currently, located, at, the, natural, history, museum, of, berlin, though, it, was, the, initial, holotype, there, were, indications, that, it, might, not, have, been, from, the, same, animal, as, the, body, fossils, in, 2019, it, was, reported, that, laser, imaging, had, revealed, the, structure, of, the, quill, which, had, not, been, visible, since, some, time, after, the, feather, was, described, and, that, the, feather, was, inconsistent, with, the, morphology, of, all, other, archaeopteryx, feathers, known, leading, to, the, conclusion, that, it, originated, from, another, dinosaur, this, conclusion, was, challenged, in, 2020, as, being, unlikely, the, feather, was, identified, on, the, basis, of, morphology, as, most, likely, having, been, an, upper, major, primary, covert, feather, the, first, skeleton, known, as, the, london, specimen, bmnh, 37001, was, unearthed, in, 1861, near, langenaltheim, germany, and, perhaps, given, to, local, physician, karl, h, berlein, in, return, for, medical, services, he, then, sold, it, for, 700, roughly, 83, 000, in, 2020, to, the, natural, history, museum, in, london, where, it, remains, missing, most, of, its, head, and, neck, it, was, described, in, 1863, by, richard, owen, as, archaeopteryx, macrura, allowing, for, the, possibility, it, did, not, belong, to, the, same, species, as, the, feather, in, the, subsequent, fourth, edition, of, his, on, the, origin, of, species, charles, darwin, described, how, some, authors, had, maintained, that, the, whole, class, of, birds, came, suddenly, into, existence, during, the, eocene, period, but, now, we, know, on, the, authority, of, professor, owen, that, a, bird, certainly, lived, during, the, deposition, of, the, upper, greensand, and, still, more, recently, that, strange, bird, the, archaeopteryx, with, a, long, lizard, like, tail, bearing, a, pair, of, feathers, on, each, joint, and, with, its, wings, furnished, with, two, free, claws, has, been, discovered, in, the, oolitic, slates, of, solnhofen, hardly, any, recent, discovery, shows, more, forcibly, than, this, how, little, we, as, yet, know, of, the, former, inhabitants, of, the, world, the, greek, word, archa, os, means, ancient, primeval, pt, ryx, primarily, means, wing, but, it, can, also, be, just, feather, meyer, suggested, this, in, his, description, at, first, he, referred, to, a, single, feather, which, appeared, to, resemble, a, modern, bird, s, remex, wing, feather, but, he, had, heard, of, and, been, shown, a, rough, sketch, of, the, london, specimen, to, which, he, referred, as, a, skelett, eines, mit, hnlichen, federn, bedeckten, tieres, skeleton, of, an, animal, covered, in, similar, feathers, in, german, this, ambiguity, is, resolved, by, the, term, schwinge, which, does, not, necessarily, mean, a, wing, used, for, flying, urschwinge, was, the, favoured, translation, of, archaeopteryx, among, german, scholars, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, in, english, ancient, pinion, offers, a, rough, approximation, to, this, since, then, twelve, specimens, have, been, recovered, the, berlin, specimen, hmn, 1880, 81, was, discovered, in, 1874, or, 1875, on, the, blumenberg, near, eichst, tt, germany, by, farmer, jakob, niemeyer, he, sold, this, precious, fossil, for, the, money, to, buy, a, cow, in, 1876, to, innkeeper, johann, d, rr, who, again, sold, it, to, ernst, otto, h, berlein, the, son, of, k, h, berlein, placed, on, sale, between, 1877, and, 1881, with, potential, buyers, including, o, c, marsh, of, yale, university, s, peabody, museum, it, eventually, was, bought, for, 20, 000, goldmark, by, the, berlin, s, natural, history, museum, where, it, now, is, displayed, the, transaction, was, financed, by, ernst, werner, von, siemens, founder, of, the, company, that, bears, his, name, described, in, 1884, by, wilhelm, dames, it, is, the, most, complete, specimen, and, the, first, with, a, complete, head, in, 1897, it, was, named, by, dames, as, a, new, species, a, siemensii, though, often, considered, a, synonym, of, a, lithographica, several, 21st, century, studies, have, concluded, that, it, is, a, distinct, species, which, includes, the, berlin, munich, and, thermopolis, specimens, composed, of, a, torso, the, maxberg, specimen, s5, was, discovered, in, 1956, near, langenaltheim, it, was, brought, to, the, attention, of, professor, florian, heller, in, 1958, and, described, by, him, in, 1959, the, specimen, is, missing, its, head, and, tail, although, the, rest, of, the, skeleton, is, mostly, intact, although, it, was, once, exhibited, at, the, maxberg, museum, in, solnhofen, it, is, currently, missing, it, belonged, to, eduard, opitsch, who, loaned, it, to, the, museum, until, 1974, after, his, death, in, 1991, it, was, discovered, that, the, specimen, was, missing, and, may, have, been, stolen, or, sold, the, haarlem, specimen, tm, 6428, 29, also, known, as, the, teylers, specimen, was, discovered, in, 1855, near, riedenburg, germany, and, described, as, a, pterodactylus, crassipes, in, 1857, by, meyer, it, was, reclassified, in, 1970, by, john, ostrom, and, is, currently, located, at, the, teylers, museum, in, haarlem, the, netherlands, it, was, the, very, first, specimen, found, but, was, incorrectly, classified, at, the, time, it, is, also, one, of, the, least, complete, specimens, consisting, mostly, of, limb, bones, isolated, cervical, vertebrae, and, ribs, in, 2017, it, was, named, as, a, separate, genus, ostromia, considered, more, closely, related, to, anchiornis, from, china, the, eichst, tt, specimen, jm, 2257, was, discovered, in, 1951, near, workerszell, germany, and, described, by, peter, wellnhofer, in, 1974, currently, located, at, the, jura, museum, in, eichst, tt, germany, it, is, the, smallest, known, specimen, and, has, the, second, best, head, it, is, possibly, a, separate, genus, jurapteryx, recurva, or, species, a, recurva, the, solnhofen, specimen, unnumbered, specimen, was, discovered, in, the, 1970s, near, eichst, tt, germany, and, described, in, 1988, by, wellnhofer, currently, located, at, the, b, rgermeister, m, ller, museum, in, solnhofen, it, originally, was, classified, as, compsognathus, by, an, amateur, collector, the, same, mayor, friedrich, m, ller, after, which, the, museum, is, named, it, is, the, largest, specimen, known, and, may, belong, to, a, separate, genus, and, species, wellnhoferia, grandis, it, is, missing, only, portions, of, the, neck, tail, backbone, and, head, the, munich, specimen, bsp, 1999, i, 50, formerly, known, as, the, solenhofer, aktien, verein, specimen, was, discovered, on, 3, august, 1992, near, langenaltheim, and, described, in, 1993, by, wellnhofer, it, is, currently, located, at, the, pal, ontologisches, museum, m, nchen, in, munich, to, which, it, was, sold, in, 1999, for, 1, 9, million, deutschmark, what, was, initially, believed, to, be, a, bony, sternum, turned, out, to, be, part, of, the, coracoid, but, a, cartilaginous, sternum, may, have, been, present, only, the, front, of, its, face, is, missing, it, has, been, used, as, the, basis, for, a, distinct, species, a, bavarica, but, more, recent, studies, suggest, it, belongs, to, a, siemensii, an, eighth, fragmentary, specimen, was, discovered, in, 1990, in, the, younger, m, rnsheim, formation, at, daiting, suevia, therefore, it, is, known, as, the, daiting, specimen, and, had, been, known, since, 1996, only, from, a, cast, briefly, shown, at, the, naturkundemuseum, in, bamberg, the, original, was, purchased, by, palaeontologist, raimund, albertsd, rfer, in, 2009, it, was, on, display, for, the, first, time, with, six, other, original, fossils, of, archaeopteryx, at, the, munich, mineral, show, in, october, 2009, the, daiting, specimen, was, subsequently, named, archaeopteryx, albersdoerferi, by, kundrat, et, al, 2018, after, a, lengthy, period, in, a, closed, private, collection, it, was, moved, to, the, museum, of, evolution, at, knuthenborg, safaripark, denmark, in, 2022, where, it, has, since, been, on, display, and, also, been, made, available, for, researchers, another, fragmentary, fossil, was, found, in, 2000, it, is, in, private, possession, and, since, 2004, on, loan, to, the, b, rgermeister, m, ller, museum, in, solnhofen, so, it, is, called, the, b, rgermeister, m, ller, specimen, the, institute, itself, officially, refers, to, it, as, the, exemplar, of, the, families, ottman, steil, solnhofen, as, the, fragment, represents, the, remains, of, a, single, wing, of, archaeopteryx, it, is, colloquially, known, as, chicken, wing, long, in, a, private, collection, in, switzerland, the, thermopolis, specimen, wdc, csg, 100, was, discovered, in, bavaria, and, described, in, 2005, by, mayr, pohl, and, peters, donated, to, the, wyoming, dinosaur, center, in, thermopolis, wyoming, it, has, the, best, preserved, head, and, feet, most, of, the, neck, and, the, lower, jaw, have, not, been, preserved, the, thermopolis, specimen, was, described, on, 2, december, 2005, science, journal, article, as, a, well, preserved, archaeopteryx, specimen, with, theropod, features, it, shows, that, archaeopteryx, lacked, a, reversed, toe, a, universal, feature, of, birds, limiting, its, ability, to, perch, on, branches, and, implying, a, terrestrial, or, trunk, climbing, lifestyle, this, has, been, interpreted, as, evidence, of, theropod, ancestry, in, 1988, gregory, s, paul, claimed, to, have, found, evidence, of, a, hyperextensible, second, toe, but, this, was, not, verified, and, accepted, by, other, scientists, until, the, thermopolis, specimen, was, described, until, now, the, feature, was, thought, to, belong, only, to, the, species, close, relatives, the, deinonychosaurs, the, thermopolis, specimen, was, assigned, to, archaeopteryx, siemensii, in, 2007, the, specimen, is, considered, to, represent, the, most, complete, and, best, preserved, archaeopteryx, remains, yet, the, discovery, of, an, eleventh, specimen, was, announced, in, 2011, it, was, described, in, 2014, it, is, one, of, the, more, complete, specimens, but, is, missing, much, of, the, skull, and, one, forelimb, it, is, privately, owned, and, has, yet, to, be, given, a, name, palaeontologists, of, the, ludwig, maximilian, university, of, munich, studied, the, specimen, which, revealed, previously, unknown, features, of, the, plumage, such, as, feathers, on, both, the, upper, and, lower, legs, and, metatarsus, and, the, only, preserved, tail, tip, a, twelfth, specimen, had, been, discovered, by, an, amateur, collector, in, 2010, at, the, schamhaupten, quarry, but, the, finding, was, only, announced, in, february, 2014, it, was, scientifically, described, in, 2018, it, represents, a, complete, and, mostly, articulated, skeleton, with, skull, it, is, the, only, specimen, lacking, preserved, feathers, it, is, from, the, painten, formation, and, somewhat, older, than, the, other, specimens, the, existence, of, a, thirteenth, specimen, the, chicago, specimen, was, announced, in, 2024, by, the, field, museum, in, chicago, us, one, of, two, specimens, in, an, institution, outside, europe, the, specimen, was, originally, identified, in, a, private, collection, in, switzerland, and, had, been, acquired, by, these, collectors, in, 1990, prior, to, germany, s, 2015, ban, on, exporting, archaeopteryx, specimens, the, specimen, was, acquired, by, the, field, museum, in, 2022, and, went, on, public, display, in, 2024, following, two, years, of, preparation, the, specimen, is, to, be, studied, by, famed, paleornithologist, jingmai, o, connor, beginning, in, 1985, an, amateur, group, including, astronomer, fred, hoyle, and, physicist, lee, spetner, published, a, series, of, papers, claiming, that, the, feathers, on, the, berlin, and, london, specimens, of, archaeopteryx, were, forged, their, claims, were, repudiated, by, alan, j, charig, and, others, at, the, natural, history, museum, in, london, most, of, their, supposed, evidence, for, a, forgery, was, based, on, unfamiliarity, with, the, processes, of, lithification, for, example, they, proposed, that, based, on, the, difference, in, texture, associated, with, the, feathers, feather, impressions, were, applied, to, a, thin, layer, of, cement, without, realizing, that, feathers, themselves, would, have, caused, a, textural, difference, they, also, misinterpreted, the, fossils, claiming, that, the, tail, was, forged, as, one, large, feather, when, visibly, this, is, not, the, case, in, addition, they, claimed, that, the, other, specimens, of, archaeopteryx, known, at, the, time, did, not, have, feathers, which, is, incorrect, the, maxberg, and, eichst, tt, specimens, have, obvious, feathers, they, also, expressed, disbelief, that, slabs, would, split, so, smoothly, or, that, one, half, of, a, slab, containing, fossils, would, have, good, preservation, but, not, the, counterslab, these, are, common, properties, of, solnhofen, fossils, because, the, dead, animals, would, fall, onto, hardened, surfaces, which, would, form, a, natural, plane, for, the, future, slabs, to, split, along, and, would, leave, the, bulk, of, the, fossil, on, one, side, and, little, on, the, other, finally, the, motives, they, suggested, for, a, forgery, are, not, strong, and, are, contradictory, one, is, that, richard, owen, wanted, to, forge, evidence, in, support, of, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, which, is, unlikely, given, owen, s, views, toward, darwin, and, his, theory, the, other, is, that, owen, wanted, to, set, a, trap, for, darwin, hoping, the, latter, would, support, the, fossils, so, owen, could, discredit, him, with, the, forgery, this, is, unlikely, because, owen, wrote, a, detailed, paper, on, the, london, specimen, so, such, an, action, would, certainly, backfire, charig, et, al, pointed, to, the, presence, of, hairline, cracks, in, the, slabs, running, through, both, rock, and, fossil, impressions, and, mineral, growth, over, the, slabs, that, had, occurred, before, discovery, and, preparation, as, evidence, that, the, feathers, were, original, spetner, et, al, then, attempted, to, show, that, the, cracks, would, have, propagated, naturally, through, their, postulated, cement, layer, but, neglected, to, account, for, the, fact, that, the, cracks, were, old, and, had, been, filled, with, calcite, and, thus, were, not, able, to, propagate, they, also, attempted, to, show, the, presence, of, cement, on, the, london, specimen, through, x, ray, spectroscopy, and, did, find, something, that, was, not, rock, it, was, not, cement, either, and, is, most, probably, a, fragment, of, silicone, rubber, left, behind, when, moulds, were, made, of, the, specimen, their, suggestions, have, not, been, taken, seriously, by, palaeontologists, as, their, evidence, was, largely, based, on, misunderstandings, of, geology, and, they, never, discussed, the, other, feather, bearing, specimens, which, have, increased, in, number, since, then, charig, et, al, reported, a, discolouration, a, dark, band, between, two, layers, of, limestone, they, say, it, is, the, product, of, sedimentation, it, is, natural, for, limestone, to, take, on, the, colour, of, its, surroundings, and, most, limestones, are, coloured, if, not, colour, banded, to, some, degree, so, the, darkness, was, attributed, to, such, impurities, they, also, mention, that, a, complete, absence, of, air, bubbles, in, the, rock, slabs, is, further, proof, that, the, specimen, is, authentic, most, of, the, specimens, of, archaeopteryx, that, have, been, discovered, come, from, the, solnhofen, limestone, in, bavaria, southern, germany, which, is, a, lagerst, tte, a, rare, and, remarkable, geological, formation, known, for, its, superbly, detailed, fossils, laid, down, during, the, early, tithonian, stage, of, the, jurassic, period, approximately, 150, 8, 148, 5, million, years, ago, archaeopteryx, was, roughly, the, size, of, a, raven, with, broad, wings, that, were, rounded, at, the, ends, and, a, long, tail, compared, to, its, body, length, it, could, reach, up, to, 0, 5, metres, 1, ft, 8, in, in, body, length, and, 0, 7, metres, 2, ft, 4, in, in, wingspan, with, an, estimated, mass, of, 0, 5, to, 1, kilogram, 1, 1, to, 2, 2, lb, archaeopteryx, feathers, although, less, documented, than, its, other, features, were, very, similar, in, structure, to, modern, day, bird, feathers, despite, the, presence, of, numerous, avian, features, archaeopteryx, had, many, non, avian, theropod, dinosaur, characteristics, unlike, modern, birds, archaeopteryx, had, small, teeth, as, well, as, a, long, bony, tail, features, which, archaeopteryx, shared, with, other, dinosaurs, of, the, time, because, it, displays, features, common, to, both, birds, and, non, avian, dinosaurs, archaeopteryx, has, often, been, considered, a, link, between, them, in, the, 1970s, john, ostrom, following, thomas, henry, huxley, s, lead, in, 1868, argued, that, birds, evolved, within, theropod, dinosaurs, and, archaeopteryx, was, a, critical, piece, of, evidence, for, this, argument, it, had, several, avian, features, such, as, a, wishbone, flight, feathers, wings, and, a, partially, reversed, first, toe, along, with, dinosaur, and, theropod, features, for, instance, it, has, a, long, ascending, process, of, the, ankle, bone, interdental, plates, an, obturator, process, of, the, ischium, and, long, chevrons, in, the, tail, in, particular, ostrom, found, that, archaeopteryx, was, remarkably, similar, to, the, theropod, family, dromaeosauridae, archaeopteryx, had, three, separate, digits, on, each, fore, leg, each, ending, with, a, claw, few, birds, have, such, features, some, birds, such, as, ducks, swans, jacanas, jacana, sp, and, the, hoatzin, opisthocomus, hoazin, have, them, concealed, beneath, their, leg, feathers, specimens, of, archaeopteryx, were, most, notable, for, their, well, developed, flight, feathers, they, were, markedly, asymmetrical, and, showed, the, structure, of, flight, feathers, in, modern, birds, with, vanes, given, stability, by, a, barb, barbule, barbicel, arrangement, the, tail, feathers, were, less, asymmetrical, again, in, line, with, the, situation, in, modern, birds, and, also, had, firm, vanes, the, thumb, did, not, yet, bear, a, separately, movable, tuft, of, stiff, feathers, the, body, plumage, of, archaeopteryx, is, less, well, documented, and, has, only, been, properly, researched, in, the, well, preserved, berlin, specimen, thus, as, more, than, one, species, seems, to, be, involved, the, research, into, the, berlin, specimen, s, feathers, does, not, necessarily, hold, true, for, the, rest, of, the, species, of, archaeopteryx, in, the, berlin, specimen, there, are, trousers, of, well, developed, feathers, on, the, legs, some, of, these, feathers, seem, to, have, a, basic, contour, feather, structure, but, are, somewhat, decomposed, they, lack, barbicels, as, in, ratites, in, part, they, are, firm, and, thus, capable, of, supporting, flight, a, patch, of, pennaceous, feathers, is, found, running, along, its, back, which, was, quite, similar, to, the, contour, feathers, of, the, body, plumage, of, modern, birds, in, being, symmetrical, and, firm, although, not, as, stiff, as, the, flight, related, feathers, apart, from, that, the, feather, traces, in, the, berlin, specimen, are, limited, to, a, sort, of, proto, down, not, dissimilar, to, that, found, in, the, dinosaur, sinosauropteryx, decomposed, and, fluffy, and, possibly, even, appearing, more, like, fur, than, feathers, in, life, although, not, in, their, microscopic, structure, these, occur, on, the, remainder, of, the, body, although, some, feathers, did, not, fossilize, and, others, were, obliterated, during, preparation, leaving, bare, patches, on, specimens, and, the, lower, neck, there, is, no, indication, of, feathering, on, the, upper, neck, and, head, while, these, conceivably, may, have, been, nude, this, may, still, be, an, artefact, of, preservation, it, appears, that, most, archaeopteryx, specimens, became, embedded, in, anoxic, sediment, after, drifting, some, time, on, their, backs, in, the, sea, the, head, neck, and, the, tail, are, generally, bent, downward, which, suggests, that, the, specimens, had, just, started, to, rot, when, they, were, embedded, with, tendons, and, muscle, relaxing, so, that, the, characteristic, shape, death, pose, of, the, fossil, specimens, was, achieved, this, would, mean, that, the, skin, already, was, softened, and, loose, which, is, bolstered, by, the, fact, that, in, some, specimens, the, flight, feathers, were, starting, to, detach, at, the, point, of, embedding, in, the, sediment, so, it, is, hypothesized, that, the, pertinent, specimens, moved, along, the, sea, bed, in, shallow, water, for, some, time, before, burial, the, head, and, upper, neck, feathers, sloughing, off, while, the, more, firmly, attached, tail, feathers, remained, in, 2011, graduate, student, ryan, carney, and, colleagues, performed, the, first, colour, study, on, an, archaeopteryx, specimen, using, scanning, electron, microscopy, technology, and, energy, dispersive, x, ray, analysis, the, team, was, able, to, detect, the, structure, of, melanosomes, in, the, isolated, feather, specimen, described, in, 1861, the, resultant, measurements, were, then, compared, to, those, of, 87, modern, bird, species, and, the, original, colour, was, calculated, with, a, 95, likelihood, to, be, black, the, feather, was, determined, to, be, black, throughout, with, heavier, pigmentation, in, the, distal, tip, the, feather, studied, was, most, probably, a, dorsal, covert, which, would, have, partly, covered, the, primary, feathers, on, the, wings, the, study, does, not, mean, that, archaeopteryx, was, entirely, black, but, suggests, that, it, had, some, black, colouration, which, included, the, coverts, carney, pointed, out, that, this, is, consistent, with, what, is, known, of, modern, flight, characteristics, in, that, black, melanosomes, have, structural, properties, that, strengthen, feathers, for, flight, in, a, 2013, study, published, in, the, journal, of, analytical, atomic, spectrometry, new, analyses, of, archaeopteryx, s, feathers, revealed, that, the, animal, may, have, had, complex, light, and, dark, coloured, plumage, with, heavier, pigmentation, in, the, distal, tips, and, outer, vanes, this, analysis, of, colour, distribution, was, based, primarily, on, the, distribution, of, sulphate, within, the, fossil, an, author, on, the, previous, archaeopteryx, colour, study, argued, against, the, interpretation, of, such, biomarkers, as, an, indicator, of, eumelanin, in, the, full, archaeopteryx, specimen, carney, and, other, colleagues, also, argued, against, the, 2013, study, s, interpretation, of, the, sulphate, and, trace, metals, and, in, a, 2020, study, published, in, scientific, reports, demonstrated, that, the, isolated, covert, feather, was, entirely, matte, black, as, opposed, to, black, and, white, or, iridescent, and, that, the, remaining, plumage, patterns, of, archaeopteryx, remain, unknown, today, fossils, of, the, genus, archaeopteryx, are, usually, assigned, to, one, or, two, species, a, lithographica, and, a, siemensii, but, their, taxonomic, history, is, complicated, ten, names, have, been, published, for, the, handful, of, specimens, as, interpreted, today, the, name, a, lithographica, only, referred, to, the, single, feather, described, by, meyer, in, 1954, gavin, de, beer, concluded, that, the, london, specimen, was, the, holotype, in, 1960, swinton, accordingly, proposed, that, the, name, archaeopteryx, lithographica, be, placed, on, the, official, genera, list, making, the, alternative, names, griphosaurus, and, griphornis, invalid, the, iczn, implicitly, accepting, de, beer, s, standpoint, did, indeed, suppress, the, plethora, of, alternative, names, initially, proposed, for, the, first, skeleton, specimens, which, mainly, resulted, from, the, acrimonious, dispute, between, meyer, and, his, opponent, johann, andreas, wagner, whose, griphosaurus, problematicus, problematic, riddle, lizard, was, a, vitriolic, sneer, at, meyer, s, archaeopteryx, in, addition, in, 1977, the, commission, ruled, that, the, first, species, name, of, the, haarlem, specimen, crassipes, described, by, meyer, as, a, pterosaur, before, its, true, nature, was, realized, was, not, to, be, given, preference, over, lithographica, in, instances, where, scientists, considered, them, to, represent, the, same, species, it, has, been, noted, that, the, feather, the, first, specimen, of, archaeopteryx, described, does, not, correspond, well, with, the, flight, related, feathers, of, archaeopteryx, it, certainly, is, a, flight, feather, of, a, contemporary, species, but, its, size, and, proportions, indicate, that, it, may, belong, to, another, smaller, species, of, feathered, theropod, of, which, only, this, feather, is, known, so, far, as, the, feather, had, been, designated, the, type, specimen, the, name, archaeopteryx, should, then, no, longer, be, applied, to, the, skeletons, thus, creating, significant, nomenclatorial, confusion, in, 2007, two, sets, of, scientists, therefore, petitioned, the, iczn, requesting, that, the, london, specimen, explicitly, be, made, the, type, by, designating, it, as, the, new, holotype, specimen, or, neotype, this, suggestion, was, upheld, by, the, iczn, after, four, years, of, debate, and, the, london, specimen, was, designated, the, neotype, on, 3, october, 2011, below, is, a, cladogram, published, in, 2013, by, godefroit, et, al, aurornis, anchiornis, archaeopteryx, xiaotingia, jeholornis, rahonavis, balaur, avebrevicauda, includes, modern, birds, it, has, been, argued, that, all, the, specimens, belong, to, the, same, species, a, lithographica, differences, do, exist, among, the, specimens, and, while, some, researchers, regard, these, as, due, to, the, different, ages, of, the, specimens, some, may, be, related, to, actual, species, diversity, in, particular, the, munich, eichst, tt, solnhofen, and, thermopolis, specimens, differ, from, the, london, berlin, and, haarlem, specimens, in, being, smaller, or, much, larger, having, different, finger, proportions, having, more, slender, snouts, lined, with, forward, pointing, teeth, and, the, possible, presence, of, a, sternum, due, to, these, differences, most, individual, specimens, have, been, given, their, own, species, name, at, one, point, or, another, the, berlin, specimen, has, been, designated, as, archaeornis, siemensii, the, eichst, tt, specimen, as, jurapteryx, recurva, the, munich, specimen, as, archaeopteryx, bavarica, and, the, solnhofen, specimen, as, wellnhoferia, grandis, in, 2007, a, review, of, all, well, preserved, specimens, including, the, then, newly, discovered, thermopolis, specimen, concluded, that, two, distinct, species, of, archaeopteryx, could, be, supported, a, lithographica, consisting, of, at, least, the, london, and, solnhofen, specimens, and, a, siemensii, consisting, of, at, least, the, berlin, munich, and, thermopolis, specimens, the, two, species, are, distinguished, primarily, by, large, flexor, tubercles, on, the, foot, claws, in, a, lithographica, the, claws, of, a, siemensii, specimens, being, relatively, simple, and, straight, a, lithographica, also, had, a, constricted, portion, of, the, crown, in, some, teeth, and, a, stouter, metatarsus, a, supposed, additional, species, wellnhoferia, grandis, based, on, the, solnhofen, specimen, seems, to, be, indistinguishable, from, a, lithographica, except, in, its, larger, size, if, two, names, are, given, the, first, denotes, the, original, describer, of, the, species, the, second, the, author, on, whom, the, given, name, combination, is, based, as, always, in, zoological, nomenclature, putting, an, author, s, name, in, parentheses, denotes, that, the, taxon, was, originally, described, in, a, different, genus, archaeopteryx, vicensensis, anon, fide, lambrecht, 1933, is, a, nomen, nudum, for, what, appears, to, be, an, undescribed, pterosaur, modern, palaeontology, has, often, classified, archaeopteryx, as, the, most, primitive, bird, however, it, is, not, thought, to, be, a, true, ancestor, of, modern, birds, but, rather, a, close, relative, of, that, ancestor, nonetheless, archaeopteryx, was, often, used, as, a, model, of, the, true, ancestral, bird, several, authors, have, done, so, lowe, 1935, and, thulborn, 1984, questioned, whether, archaeopteryx, truly, was, the, first, bird, they, suggested, that, archaeopteryx, was, a, dinosaur, that, was, no, more, closely, related, to, birds, than, were, other, dinosaur, groups, kurzanov, 1987, suggested, that, avimimus, was, more, likely, to, be, the, ancestor, of, all, birds, than, archaeopteryx, barsbold, 1983, and, zweers, and, van, den, berge, 1997, noted, that, many, maniraptoran, lineages, are, extremely, birdlike, and, they, suggested, that, different, groups, of, birds, may, have, descended, from, different, dinosaur, ancestors, the, discovery, of, the, closely, related, xiaotingia, in, 2011, led, to, new, phylogenetic, analyses, that, suggested, that, archaeopteryx, is, a, deinonychosaur, rather, than, an, avialan, and, therefore, not, a, bird, under, most, common, uses, of, that, term, a, more, thorough, analysis, was, published, soon, after, to, test, this, hypothesis, and, failed, to, arrive, at, the, same, result, it, found, archaeopteryx, in, its, traditional, position, at, the, base, of, avialae, while, xiaotingia, was, recovered, as, a, basal, dromaeosaurid, or, troodontid, the, authors, of, the, follow, up, study, noted, that, uncertainties, still, exist, and, that, it, may, not, be, possible, to, state, confidently, whether, or, not, archaeopteryx, is, a, member, of, avialae, or, not, barring, new, and, better, specimens, of, relevant, species, phylogenetic, studies, conducted, by, senter, et, al, 2012, and, turner, makovicky, and, norell, 2012, also, found, archaeopteryx, to, be, more, closely, related, to, living, birds, than, to, dromaeosaurids, and, troodontids, on, the, other, hand, godefroit, et, al, 2013, recovered, archaeopteryx, as, more, closely, related, to, dromaeosaurids, and, troodontids, in, the, analysis, included, in, their, description, of, eosinopteryx, brevipenna, the, authors, used, a, modified, version, of, the, matrix, from, the, study, describing, xiaotingia, adding, jinfengopteryx, elegans, and, eosinopteryx, brevipenna, to, it, as, well, as, adding, four, additional, characters, related, to, the, development, of, the, plumage, unlike, the, analysis, from, the, description, of, xiaotingia, the, analysis, conducted, by, godefroit, et, al, did, not, find, archaeopteryx, to, be, related, particularly, closely, to, anchiornis, and, xiaotingia, which, were, recovered, as, basal, troodontids, instead, agnol, n, and, novas, 2013, found, archaeopteryx, and, possibly, synonymous, wellnhoferia, to, be, form, a, clade, sister, to, the, lineage, including, jeholornis, and, pygostylia, with, microraptoria, unenlagiinae, and, the, clade, containing, anchiornis, and, xiaotingia, being, successively, closer, outgroups, to, the, avialae, defined, by, the, authors, as, the, clade, stemming, from, the, last, common, ancestor, of, archaeopteryx, and, aves, another, phylogenetic, study, by, godefroit, et, al, using, a, more, inclusive, matrix, than, the, one, from, the, analysis, in, the, description, of, eosinopteryx, brevipenna, also, found, archaeopteryx, to, be, a, member, of, avialae, defined, by, the, authors, as, the, most, inclusive, clade, containing, passer, domesticus, but, not, dromaeosaurus, albertensis, or, troodon, formosus, archaeopteryx, was, found, to, form, a, grade, at, the, base, of, avialae, with, xiaotingia, anchiornis, and, aurornis, compared, to, archaeopteryx, xiaotingia, was, found, to, be, more, closely, related, to, extant, birds, while, both, anchiornis, and, aurornis, were, found, to, be, more, distantly, so, hu, et, al, 2018, wang, et, al, 2018, and, hartman, et, al, 2019, found, archaeopteryx, to, have, been, a, deinonychosaur, instead, of, an, avialan, more, specifically, it, and, closely, related, taxa, were, considered, basal, deinonychosaurs, with, dromaeosaurids, and, troodontids, forming, together, a, parallel, lineage, within, the, group, because, hartman, et, al, found, archaeopteryx, isolated, in, a, group, of, flightless, deinonychosaurs, otherwise, considered, anchiornithids, they, considered, it, highly, probable, that, this, animal, evolved, flight, independently, from, bird, ancestors, and, from, microraptor, and, yi, the, following, cladogram, illustrates, their, hypothesis, regarding, the, position, of, archaeopteryx, oviraptorosauria, avialae, unenlagiidae, dromaeosauridae, troodontidae, serikornis, caihong, anchiornis, archaeopteryx, eosinopteryx, aurornis, the, authors, however, found, that, the, archaeopteryx, being, an, avialan, was, only, slightly, less, likely, than, this, hypothesis, and, as, likely, as, archaeopterygidae, and, troodontidae, being, sister, clades, as, in, the, wings, of, modern, birds, the, flight, feathers, of, archaeopteryx, were, somewhat, asymmetrical, and, the, tail, feathers, were, rather, broad, this, implies, that, the, wings, and, tail, were, used, for, lift, generation, but, it, is, unclear, whether, archaeopteryx, was, capable, of, flapping, flight, or, simply, a, glider, the, lack, of, a, bony, breastbone, suggests, that, archaeopteryx, was, not, a, very, strong, flier, but, flight, muscles, might, have, attached, to, the, thick, boomerang, shaped, wishbone, the, platelike, coracoids, or, perhaps, to, a, cartilaginous, sternum, the, sideways, orientation, of, the, glenoid, shoulder, joint, between, scapula, coracoid, and, humerus, instead, of, the, dorsally, angled, arrangement, found, in, modern, birds, may, indicate, that, archaeopteryx, was, unable, to, lift, its, wings, above, its, back, a, requirement, for, the, upstroke, found, in, modern, flapping, flight, according, to, a, study, by, philip, senter, in, 2006, archaeopteryx, was, indeed, unable, to, use, flapping, flight, as, modern, birds, do, but, it, may, well, have, used, a, downstroke, only, flap, assisted, gliding, technique, however, a, more, recent, study, solves, this, issue, by, suggesting, a, different, flight, stroke, configuration, for, non, avian, flying, theropods, archaeopteryx, wings, were, relatively, large, which, would, have, resulted, in, a, low, stall, speed, and, reduced, turning, radius, the, short, and, rounded, shape, of, the, wings, would, have, increased, drag, but, also, could, have, improved, its, ability, to, fly, through, cluttered, environments, such, as, trees, and, brush, similar, wing, shapes, are, seen, in, birds, that, fly, through, trees, and, brush, such, as, crows, and, pheasants, the, presence, of, hind, wings, asymmetrical, flight, feathers, stemming, from, the, legs, similar, to, those, seen, in, dromaeosaurids, such, as, microraptor, also, would, have, added, to, the, aerial, mobility, of, archaeopteryx, the, first, detailed, study, of, the, hind, wings, by, longrich, in, 2006, suggested, that, the, structures, formed, up, to, 12, of, the, total, airfoil, this, would, have, reduced, stall, speed, by, up, to, 6, and, turning, radius, by, up, to, 12, the, feathers, of, archaeopteryx, were, asymmetrical, this, has, been, interpreted, as, evidence, that, it, was, a, flyer, because, flightless, birds, tend, to, have, symmetrical, feathers, some, scientists, including, thomson, and, speakman, have, questioned, this, they, studied, more, than, 70, families, of, living, birds, and, found, that, some, flightless, types, do, have, a, range, of, asymmetry, in, their, feathers, and, that, the, feathers, of, archaeopteryx, fall, into, this, range, the, degree, of, asymmetry, seen, in, archaeopteryx, is, more, typical, for, slow, flyers, than, for, flightless, birds, in, 2010, robert, l, nudds, and, gareth, j, dyke, in, the, journal, science, published, a, paper, in, which, they, analysed, the, rachises, of, the, primary, feathers, of, confuciusornis, and, archaeopteryx, the, analysis, suggested, that, the, rachises, on, these, two, genera, were, thinner, and, weaker, than, those, of, modern, birds, relative, to, body, mass, the, authors, determined, that, archaeopteryx, and, confuciusornis, were, unable, to, use, flapping, flight, this, study, was, criticized, by, philip, j, currie, and, luis, chiappe, chiappe, suggested, that, it, is, difficult, to, measure, the, rachises, of, fossilized, feathers, and, currie, speculated, that, archaeopteryx, and, confuciusornis, must, have, been, able, to, fly, to, some, degree, as, their, fossils, are, preserved, in, what, is, believed, to, have, been, marine, or, lake, sediments, suggesting, that, they, must, have, been, able, to, fly, over, deep, water, gregory, paul, also, disagreed, with, the, study, arguing, in, a, 2010, response, that, nudds, and, dyke, had, overestimated, the, masses, of, these, early, birds, and, that, more, accurate, mass, estimates, allowed, powered, flight, even, with, relatively, narrow, rachises, nudds, and, dyke, had, assumed, a, mass, of, 250, g, 8, 8, oz, for, the, munich, specimen, archaeopteryx, a, young, juvenile, based, on, published, mass, estimates, of, larger, specimens, paul, argued, that, a, more, reasonable, body, mass, estimate, for, the, munich, specimen, is, about, 140, g, 4, 9, oz, paul, also, criticized, the, measurements, of, the, rachises, themselves, noting, that, the, feathers, in, the, munich, specimen, are, poorly, preserved, nudds, and, dyke, reported, a, diameter, of, 0, 75, mm, 0, 03, in, for, the, longest, primary, feather, which, paul, could, not, confirm, using, photographs, paul, measured, some, of, the, inner, primary, feathers, finding, rachises, 1, 25, 1, 4, mm, 0, 049, 0, 055, in, across, despite, these, criticisms, nudds, and, dyke, stood, by, their, original, conclusions, they, claimed, that, paul, s, statement, that, an, adult, archaeopteryx, would, have, been, a, better, flyer, than, the, juvenile, munich, specimen, was, dubious, this, they, reasoned, would, require, an, even, thicker, rachis, evidence, for, which, has, not, yet, been, presented, another, possibility, is, that, they, had, not, achieved, true, flight, but, instead, used, their, wings, as, aids, for, extra, lift, while, running, over, water, after, the, fashion, of, the, basilisk, lizard, which, could, explain, their, presence, in, lake, and, marine, deposits, see, origin, of, avian, flight, in, 2004, scientists, analysing, a, detailed, ct, scan, of, the, braincase, of, the, london, archaeopteryx, concluded, that, its, brain, was, significantly, larger, than, that, of, most, dinosaurs, indicating, that, it, possessed, the, brain, size, necessary, for, flying, the, overall, brain, anatomy, was, reconstructed, using, the, scan, the, reconstruction, showed, that, the, regions, associated, with, vision, took, up, nearly, one, third, of, the, brain, other, well, developed, areas, involved, hearing, and, muscle, coordination, the, skull, scan, also, revealed, the, structure, of, its, inner, ear, the, structure, more, closely, resembles, that, of, modern, birds, than, the, inner, ear, of, non, avian, reptiles, these, characteristics, taken, together, suggest, that, archaeopteryx, had, the, keen, sense, of, hearing, balance, spatial, perception, and, coordination, needed, to, fly, archaeopteryx, had, a, cerebrum, to, brain, volume, ratio, 78, of, the, way, to, modern, birds, from, the, condition, of, non, coelurosaurian, dinosaurs, such, as, carcharodontosaurus, or, allosaurus, which, had, a, crocodile, like, anatomy, of, the, brain, and, inner, ear, newer, research, shows, that, while, the, archaeopteryx, brain, was, more, complex, than, that, of, more, primitive, theropods, it, had, a, more, generalized, brain, volume, among, maniraptora, dinosaurs, even, smaller, than, that, of, other, non, avian, dinosaurs, in, several, instances, which, indicates, the, neurological, development, required, for, flight, was, already, a, common, trait, in, the, maniraptoran, clade, recent, studies, of, flight, feather, barb, geometry, reveal, that, modern, birds, possess, a, larger, barb, angle, in, the, trailing, vane, of, the, feather, whereas, archaeopteryx, lacks, this, large, barb, angle, indicating, potentially, weak, flight, abilities, archaeopteryx, continues, to, play, an, important, part, in, scientific, debates, about, the, origin, and, evolution, of, birds, some, scientists, see, it, as, a, semi, arboreal, climbing, animal, following, the, idea, that, birds, evolved, from, tree, dwelling, gliders, the, trees, down, hypothesis, for, the, evolution, of, flight, proposed, by, o, c, marsh, other, scientists, see, archaeopteryx, as, running, quickly, along, the, ground, supporting, the, idea, that, birds, evolved, flight, by, running, the, ground, up, hypothesis, proposed, by, samuel, wendell, williston, still, others, suggest, that, archaeopteryx, might, have, been, at, home, both, in, the, trees, and, on, the, ground, like, modern, crows, and, this, latter, view, is, what, currently, is, considered, best, supported, by, morphological, characters, altogether, it, appears, that, the, species, was, not, particularly, specialized, for, running, on, the, ground, or, for, perching, a, scenario, outlined, by, el, anowski, in, 2002, suggested, that, archaeopteryx, used, its, wings, mainly, to, escape, predators, by, glides, punctuated, with, shallow, downstrokes, to, reach, successively, higher, perches, and, alternatively, to, cover, longer, distances, mainly, by, gliding, down, from, cliffs, or, treetops, in, march, 2018, scientists, reported, that, archaeopteryx, was, likely, capable, of, a, flight, stroke, cycle, morphologically, closer, to, the, grabbing, motion, of, maniraptorans, and, distinct, from, that, of, modern, birds, this, study, on, archaeopteryx, s, bone, histology, identified, biomechanical, and, physiological, adaptations, exhibited, by, modern, volant, birds, that, perform, intermittent, flapping, such, as, pheasants, and, other, burst, flyers, some, researchers, suggested, that, the, feather, sheaths, of, archaeopteryx, shows, a, center, out, flight, related, moulting, strategy, like, modern, birds, as, it, was, a, weak, flier, this, would, have, been, extremely, advantageous, in, preserving, its, maximum, flight, performance, kiat, and, colleagues, reinterpreted, this, purported, moulting, evidence, to, be, problematic, and, equivocal, at, best, and, considered, that, these, structures, more, likely, represents, the, calami, traces, of, the, fully, grown, feathers, though, the, original, authors, still, remained, by, their, conclusion, an, histological, study, by, erickson, norell, zhongue, and, others, in, 2009, estimated, that, archaeopteryx, grew, relatively, slowly, compared, to, modern, birds, presumably, because, the, outermost, portions, of, archaeopteryx, bones, appear, poorly, vascularized, in, living, vertebrates, poorly, vascularized, bone, is, correlated, with, slow, growth, rate, they, also, assume, that, all, known, skeletons, of, archaeopteryx, come, from, juvenile, specimens, because, the, bones, of, archaeopteryx, could, not, be, histologically, sectioned, in, a, formal, skeletochronological, growth, ring, analysis, erickson, and, colleagues, used, bone, vascularity, porosity, to, estimate, bone, growth, rate, they, assumed, that, poorly, vascularized, bone, grows, at, similar, rates, in, all, birds, and, in, archaeopteryx, the, poorly, vascularized, bone, of, archaeopteryx, might, have, grown, as, slowly, as, that, in, a, mallard, 2, 5, micrometres, per, day, or, as, fast, as, that, in, an, ostrich, 4, 2, micrometres, per, day, using, this, range, of, bone, growth, rates, they, calculated, how, long, it, would, take, to, grow, each, specimen, of, archaeopteryx, to, the, observed, size, it, may, have, taken, at, least, 970, days, there, were, 375, days, in, a, late, jurassic, year, to, reach, an, adult, size, of, 0, 8, 1, kg, 1, 8, 2, 2, lb, the, study, also, found, that, the, avialans, jeholornis, and, sapeornis, grew, relatively, slowly, as, did, the, dromaeosaurid, mahakala, the, avialans, confuciusornis, and, ichthyornis, grew, relatively, quickly, following, a, growth, trend, similar, to, that, of, modern, birds, one, of, the, few, modern, birds, that, exhibit, slow, growth, is, the, flightless, kiwi, and, the, authors, speculated, that, archaeopteryx, and, the, kiwi, had, similar, basal, metabolic, rate, comparisons, between, the, scleral, rings, of, archaeopteryx, and, modern, birds, and, reptiles, indicate, that, it, may, have, been, diurnal, similar, to, most, modern, birds, the, richness, and, diversity, of, the, solnhofen, limestones, in, which, all, specimens, of, archaeopteryx, have, been, found, have, shed, light, on, an, ancient, jurassic, bavaria, strikingly, different, from, the, present, day, the, latitude, was, similar, to, florida, though, the, climate, was, likely, to, have, been, drier, as, evidenced, by, fossils, of, plants, with, adaptations, for, arid, conditions, and, a, lack, of, terrestrial, sediments, characteristic, of, rivers, evidence, of, plants, although, scarce, include, cycads, and, conifers, while, animals, found, include, a, large, number, of, insects, small, lizards, pterosaurs, and, compsognathus, the, excellent, preservation, of, archaeopteryx, fossils, and, other, terrestrial, fossils, found, at, solnhofen, indicates, that, they, did, not, travel, far, before, becoming, preserved, the, archaeopteryx, specimens, found, were, therefore, likely, to, have, lived, on, the, low, islands, surrounding, the, solnhofen, lagoon, rather, than, to, have, been, corpses, that, drifted, in, from, farther, away, archaeopteryx, skeletons, are, considerably, less, numerous, in, the, deposits, of, solnhofen, than, those, of, pterosaurs, of, which, seven, genera, have, been, found, the, pterosaurs, included, species, such, as, rhamphorhynchus, belonging, to, the, rhamphorhynchidae, the, group, which, dominated, the, ecological, niche, currently, occupied, by, seabirds, and, which, became, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, jurassic, the, pterosaurs, which, also, included, pterodactylus, were, common, enough, that, it, is, unlikely, that, the, specimens, found, are, vagrants, from, the, larger, islands, 50, km, 31, mi, to, the, north, the, islands, that, surrounded, the, solnhofen, lagoon, were, low, lying, semi, arid, and, sub, tropical, with, a, long, dry, season, and, little, rain, the, closest, modern, analogue, for, the, solnhofen, conditions, is, said, to, be, orca, basin, in, the, northern, gulf, of, mexico, although, it, is, much, deeper, than, the, solnhofen, lagoons, the, flora, of, these, islands, was, adapted, to, these, dry, conditions, and, consisted, mostly, of, low, 3, m, shrubs, contrary, to, reconstructions, of, archaeopteryx, climbing, large, trees, these, seem, to, have, been, mostly, absent, from, the, islands, few, trunks, have, been, found, in, the, sediments, and, fossilized, tree, pollen, also, is, absent, the, lifestyle, of, archaeopteryx, is, difficult, to, reconstruct, and, there, are, several, theories, regarding, it, some, researchers, suggest, that, it, was, primarily, adapted, to, life, on, the, ground, while, other, researchers, suggest, that, it, was, principally, arboreal, on, the, basis, of, the, curvature, of, the, claws, which, has, since, been, questioned, the, absence, of, trees, does, not, preclude, archaeopteryx, from, an, arboreal, lifestyle, as, several, species, of, bird, live, exclusively, in, low, shrubs, various, aspects, of, the, morphology, of, archaeopteryx, point, to, either, an, arboreal, or, ground, existence, including, the, length, of, its, legs, and, the, elongation, in, its, feet, some, authorities, consider, it, likely, to, have, been, a, generalist, capable, of, feeding, in, both, shrubs, and, open, ground, as, well, as, along, the, shores, of, the, lagoon, it, most, likely, hunted, small, prey, seizing, it, with, its, jaws, if, it, was, small, enough, or, with, its, claws, if, it, was, larger
