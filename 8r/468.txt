chimaeras, are, cartilaginous, fish, in, the, order, chimaeriformes, k, m, r, f, r, m, i, z, known, informally, as, ghost, sharks, rat, fish, spookfish, or, rabbit, fish, the, last, three, names, are, not, to, be, confused, with, rattails, opisthoproctidae, or, siganidae, respectively, at, one, time, a, diverse, and, abundant, group, based, on, the, fossil, record, their, closest, living, relatives, are, sharks, and, rays, though, their, last, common, ancestor, with, them, lived, nearly, 400, million, years, ago, living, species, are, largely, confined, to, deep, water, chimaeras, are, soft, bodied, shark, like, fish, with, bulky, heads, and, long, tapered, tails, measured, from, the, tail, they, can, grow, up, to, 150, cm, 4, 9, ft, in, length, like, other, members, of, the, class, chondrichthyes, chimaera, skeletons, are, entirely, cartilaginous, or, composed, of, cartilage, their, skin, is, smooth, and, relatively, free, of, scales, or, unique, features, lacking, the, keeled, tooth, like, placoid, scales, denticles, present, on, sharks, and, rays, however, there, are, still, exceptions, as, hatchlings, retain, a, few, rows, of, denticles, on, the, back, and, adult, males, bear, denticulated, sexual, organs, the, gill, arches, are, condensed, into, a, pouch, like, bundle, covered, by, a, sheet, of, skin, an, operculum, with, a, single, gill, opening, in, front, of, the, pectoral, fins, the, pectoral, fins, are, large, enough, to, generate, lift, at, a, relaxed, forward, momentum, giving, the, chimaera, the, appearance, of, flying, through, the, water, further, back, on, the, body, are, also, a, pair, of, smaller, pelvic, fins, and, some, genera, bear, an, anal, fin, in, front, of, the, tail, in, chimaerids, and, rhinochimaerids, the, tail, is, leptocercal, meaning, that, it, is, thin, and, whip, like, edged, from, above, and, below, by, fins, of, similar, size, in, callorhinchids, the, tail, is, instead, heterocercal, with, a, larger, upper, lobe, inclined, upwards, similar, to, many, sharks, there, are, two, dorsal, fins, a, large, triangular, first, dorsal, fin, and, a, low, rectangular, or, depressed, second, dorsal, fin, for, defense, some, chimaeras, have, a, venomous, spine, on, the, front, edge, of, the, dorsal, fin, in, many, species, the, bulbous, snout, is, modified, into, an, elongated, sensory, organ, capable, of, electroreception, to, find, prey, the, cartilaginous, skull, is, holostylic, meaning, that, the, palatoquadrate, upper, jaw, cartilage, is, completely, fused, to, the, neurocranium, cranial, cartilage, this, contrasts, with, modern, sharks, where, the, palatoquadrate, is, movable, and, detachable, a, trait, known, as, hyostyly, the, back, of, the, head, is, supported, by, a, complex, of, fused, vertebrae, called, the, synarcual, which, also, connects, to, the, dorsal, fin, spine, instead, of, sharks, many, sharp, consistently, replaced, teeth, chimaeras, have, just, six, large, permanent, tooth, plates, which, grow, continuously, throughout, their, entire, life, these, tooth, plates, are, arranged, in, three, pairs, with, one, pair, at, the, tip, of, the, lower, jaws, and, two, pairs, along, the, upper, jaws, they, together, form, a, protruding, beak, like, crushing, and, grinding, mechanism, comparable, to, the, incisor, teeth, of, rodents, and, lagomorphs, hence, the, name, rabbit, fish, chimaera, teeth, are, unique, among, vertebrates, due, to, their, mode, of, mineralization, most, of, each, plate, is, formed, by, relatively, soft, osteodentin, but, the, active, edges, are, supplemented, by, a, unique, hypermineralized, tissue, called, pleromin, pleromin, is, an, extremely, hard, enamel, like, tissue, arranged, into, sheets, or, beaded, rods, but, it, is, deposited, by, mesenchyme, derived, cells, similar, to, those, that, form, bone, in, addition, pleuromin, s, hardness, is, due, to, the, mineral, whitlockite, which, crystalizes, within, the, teeth, as, the, animal, matures, other, vertebrates, with, hypermineralized, teeth, rely, on, enamel, which, is, derived, from, ameloblasts, and, encases, round, crystals, of, the, mineral, apatite, chimaeras, also, differ, from, sharks, in, that, they, have, separate, anal, and, urogenital, openings, chimaeras, live, in, temperate, ocean, floors, down, to, 2, 600, m, 8, 500, ft, deep, with, few, occurring, at, depths, shallower, than, 200, m, 660, ft, exceptions, include, the, members, of, the, genus, callorhinchus, the, rabbit, fish, and, the, spotted, ratfish, which, locally, or, periodically, can, be, found, at, shallower, depths, consequently, these, are, also, among, the, few, species, from, the, chimaera, order, kept, in, public, aquaria, they, live, in, all, the, oceans, except, for, the, arctic, and, antarctic, oceans, the, usual, diet, of, chimaeras, consist, of, crustaceans, and, more, specifically, they, include, ophiurans, and, molluscs, modern, species, are, demersal, durophages, but, they, used, to, be, more, diverse, the, carboniferous, period, had, forms, that, lived, as, specialised, suction, feeders, in, the, water, column, chimaera, reproduction, resembles, that, of, sharks, in, some, ways, males, employ, claspers, for, internal, fertilization, of, females, and, females, lay, eggs, within, spindle, shaped, leathery, egg, cases, unlike, sharks, male, chimaeras, have, retractable, sexual, appendages, known, as, tentacula, to, assist, mating, the, frontal, tentaculum, a, bulbous, rod, which, extends, out, of, the, forehead, is, used, to, clutch, the, females, pectoral, fins, during, mating, the, prepelvic, tentacula, are, serrated, hooked, plates, normally, hidden, in, pouches, in, front, of, the, pelvic, fins, and, they, anchor, the, male, to, the, female, lastly, the, pelvic, claspers, sexual, organs, shared, by, sharks, are, fused, together, by, a, cartilaginous, sheathe, before, splitting, into, a, pair, of, flattened, lobes, at, their, tip, as, other, fish, chimaeras, have, a, number, of, parasites, chimaericola, leptogaster, chimaericolidae, is, a, monogenean, parasite, of, the, gills, of, chimaera, monstrosa, the, species, can, attain, 50, mm, 2, 0, in, in, length, despite, their, secluded, habits, some, chimaera, species, may, be, threatened, by, overfishing, through, bycatch, or, commercial, exploitation, no, species, are, listed, as, endangered, according, to, the, iucn, but, four, are, listed, as, vulnerable, four, more, as, near, threatened, and, many, more, as, data, deficient, too, rare, to, evaluate, many, species, have, restricted, ranges, and, practically, none, have, had, their, movement, patterns, studied, in, addition, bycatch, reports, are, usually, insufficiently, precise, to, the, species, or, even, genus, level, so, it, is, difficult, to, keep, track, of, bycatch, on, a, species, by, species, basis, this, lack, of, data, renders, chimaera, species, especially, susceptible, to, overlooked, population, declines, several, near, shore, species, are, purposefully, caught, for, their, meat, especially, callorhinchids, hydrolagus, bemisi, pale, ghost, shark, and, hydrolagus, novaezealandi, ae, dark, ghost, shark, modern, quotas, have, helped, to, moderate, collection, of, these, species, to, a, sustainable, level, though, callorhinchus, milii, the, australian, ghostshark, experienced, severe, overfishing, in, the, 20th, century, before, protections, were, enacted, neoharriotta, pinnata, sicklefin, chimaera, is, targeted, along, the, coast, of, india, for, its, liver, oil, and, a, recent, decline, of, catch, rates, may, indicate, a, population, crash, even, species, without, commercial, exploitation, can, fall, victim, to, bycatch, callorhinchus, callorynchus, american, elephantfish, neoharriotta, carri, dwarf, sicklefin, chimaera, chimaera, monstrosa, rabbit, fish, chimaera, ogilbyi, ogilby, s, ghostshark, hydrolagus, colliei, spotted, ratfish, and, hydrolagus, melanophasma, eastern, pacific, black, ghostshark, all, have, bycatch, rates, exceeding, 10, in, certain, parts, of, their, range, and, some, are, experiencing, steep, declines, chimaeras, have, mostly, avoided, harvesting, for, the, fin, trade, which, threatens, many, true, sharks, another, threat, is, habitat, destruction, of, coastal, nurseries, by, urban, development, or, deepwater, reefs, by, deep, sea, mining, and, trawling, near, shore, species, such, as, callorhinchus, milii, are, vulnerable, to, the, effects, of, climate, change, stronger, storms, and, warmer, seawater, are, predicted, to, increase, egg, mortality, by, disrupting, the, stable, environments, necessary, to, complete, incubation, in, some, classifications, the, chimaeras, are, included, as, subclass, holocephali, in, the, class, chondrichthyes, of, cartilaginous, fishes, in, other, systems, this, distinction, may, be, raised, to, the, level, of, class, chimaeras, also, have, some, characteristics, of, bony, fishes, a, renewed, effort, to, explore, deep, water, and, to, undertake, taxonomic, analysis, of, specimens, in, museum, collections, led, to, a, boom, during, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, in, the, number, of, new, species, identified, a, preliminary, study, found, 8, of, species, to, be, threatened, there, are, over, 50, extant, species, in, six, genera, and, three, families, with, other, genera, known, from, fossils, the, extant, species, fall, into, three, families, the, callorhinchidae, rhinochimaeridae, and, chimaeridae, with, the, callorhinchids, being, the, most, basal, clade, suborder, chimaeroidei, patterson, 1965, tracing, the, evolution, of, these, species, has, been, problematic, given, the, paucity, of, good, fossils, dna, sequencing, has, become, the, preferred, approach, to, understanding, speciation, the, group, containing, chimaeras, and, their, close, relatives, holocephali, is, thought, to, have, diverged, from, elasmobranchii, the, group, containing, modern, sharks, and, rays, during, the, devonian, over, 380, million, years, ago, the, oldest, known, chimaeriform, is, protochimaera, from, the, early, carboniferous, 338, 332, million, years, ago, of, russia, which, is, more, closely, related, to, modern, chimeras, chimaeroidei, than, any, other, known, extinct, groups, of, chimaeriformes, the, earliest, known, remains, attributable, to, modern, chimaeras, are, known, from, the, early, jurassic, pliensbachian, of, europe, but, egg, cases, from, the, late, triassic, of, yakutia, russia, and, new, zealand, that, resemble, those, of, rhinochimaerids, and, callorhinchids, respectively, indicates, that, they, had, a, global, distribution, prior, to, the, end, of, the, triassic, unlike, modern, chimaeras, mesozoic, representatives, are, often, found, in, shallow, water, settings, extinct, chimaeriforms, include
