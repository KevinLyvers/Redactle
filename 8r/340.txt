jellyfish, also, known, as, sea, jellies, are, the, medusa, phase, of, certain, gelatinous, members, of, the, subphylum, medusozoa, which, is, a, major, part, of, the, phylum, cnidaria, jellyfish, are, mainly, free, swimming, marine, animals, with, umbrella, shaped, bells, and, trailing, tentacles, although, a, few, are, anchored, to, the, seabed, by, stalks, rather, than, being, mobile, the, bell, can, pulsate, to, provide, propulsion, for, efficient, locomotion, the, tentacles, are, armed, with, stinging, cells, and, may, be, used, to, capture, prey, and, defend, against, predators, jellyfish, have, a, complex, life, cycle, the, medusa, is, normally, the, sexual, phase, which, produces, planula, larvae, these, then, disperse, widely, and, enter, a, sedentary, polyp, phase, which, may, include, asexual, budding, before, reaching, sexual, maturity, jellyfish, are, found, all, over, the, world, from, surface, waters, to, the, deep, sea, scyphozoans, the, true, jellyfish, are, exclusively, marine, but, some, hydrozoans, with, a, similar, appearance, live, in, freshwater, large, often, colorful, jellyfish, are, common, in, coastal, zones, worldwide, the, medusae, of, most, species, are, fast, growing, and, mature, within, a, few, months, then, die, soon, after, breeding, but, the, polyp, stage, attached, to, the, seabed, may, be, much, more, long, lived, jellyfish, have, been, in, existence, for, at, least, 500, million, years, and, possibly, 700, million, years, or, more, making, them, the, oldest, multi, organ, animal, group, jellyfish, are, eaten, by, humans, in, certain, cultures, they, are, considered, a, delicacy, in, some, asian, countries, where, species, in, the, rhizostomeae, order, are, pressed, and, salted, to, remove, excess, water, australian, researchers, have, described, them, as, a, perfect, food, sustainable, and, protein, rich, but, relatively, low, in, food, energy, they, are, also, used, in, cell, and, molecular, biology, research, especially, the, green, fluorescent, protein, used, by, some, species, for, bioluminescence, this, protein, has, been, adapted, as, a, fluorescent, reporter, for, inserted, genes, and, has, had, a, large, impact, on, fluorescence, microscopy, the, stinging, cells, used, by, jellyfish, to, subdue, their, prey, can, injure, humans, thousands, of, swimmers, worldwide, are, stung, every, year, with, effects, ranging, from, mild, discomfort, to, serious, injury, or, even, death, when, conditions, are, favourable, jellyfish, can, form, vast, swarms, which, can, be, responsible, for, damage, to, fishing, gear, by, filling, fishing, nets, and, sometimes, clog, the, cooling, systems, of, power, and, desalination, plants, which, draw, their, water, from, the, sea, the, name, jellyfish, in, use, since, 1796, has, traditionally, been, applied, to, medusae, and, all, similar, animals, including, the, comb, jellies, ctenophores, another, phylum, the, term, jellies, or, sea, jellies, is, more, recent, having, been, introduced, by, public, aquaria, in, an, effort, to, avoid, use, of, the, word, fish, with, its, modern, connotation, of, an, animal, with, a, backbone, though, shellfish, cuttlefish, and, starfish, are, not, vertebrates, either, in, scientific, literature, jelly, and, jellyfish, have, been, used, interchangeably, many, sources, refer, to, only, scyphozoans, as, true, jellyfish, a, group, of, jellyfish, is, called, a, smack, or, a, smuck, the, term, jellyfish, broadly, corresponds, to, medusae, that, is, a, life, cycle, stage, in, the, medusozoa, the, american, evolutionary, biologist, paulyn, cartwright, gives, the, following, general, definition, typically, medusozoan, cnidarians, have, a, pelagic, predatory, jellyfish, stage, in, their, life, cycle, staurozoans, are, the, exceptions, the, merriam, webster, dictionary, defines, jellyfish, as, follows, a, free, swimming, marine, coelenterate, that, is, the, sexually, reproducing, form, of, a, hydrozoan, or, scyphozoan, and, has, a, nearly, transparent, saucer, shaped, body, and, extensible, marginal, tentacles, studded, with, stinging, cells, given, that, jellyfish, is, a, common, name, its, mapping, to, biological, groups, is, inexact, some, authorities, have, called, the, comb, jellies, and, certain, salps, jellyfish, though, other, authorities, state, that, neither, of, these, are, jellyfish, which, they, consider, should, be, limited, to, certain, groups, within, the, medusozoa, the, non, medusozoan, clades, called, jellyfish, by, some, but, not, all, authorities, both, agreeing, and, disagreeing, citations, are, given, in, each, case, are, indicated, with, on, the, following, cladogram, of, the, animal, kingdom, porifera, ctenophora, comb, jellies, cnidaria, includes, jellyfish, and, other, jellies, protostomia, ambulacraria, tunicata, includes, salps, vertebrata, jellyfish, are, not, a, clade, as, they, include, most, of, the, medusozoa, barring, some, of, the, hydrozoa, the, medusozoan, groups, included, by, authorities, are, indicated, on, the, following, phylogenetic, tree, by, the, presence, of, citations, names, of, included, jellyfish, in, english, where, possible, are, shown, in, boldface, the, presence, of, a, named, and, cited, example, indicates, that, at, least, that, species, within, its, group, has, been, called, a, jellyfish, anthozoa, corals, polypodiozoa, and, myxozoa, parasitic, cnidarians, staurozoa, stalked, jellyfish, cubozoa, box, jellyfish, discomedusae, coronatae, crown, jellyfish, aplanulata, siphonophorae, some, leptothecata, e, g, crystal, jelly, filifera, e, g, red, paper, lantern, jellyfish, limnomedusae, e, g, flower, hat, jelly, narcomedusae, e, g, cosmic, jellyfish, the, subphylum, medusozoa, includes, all, cnidarians, with, a, medusa, stage, in, their, life, cycle, the, basic, cycle, is, egg, planula, larva, polyp, medusa, with, the, medusa, being, the, sexual, stage, the, polyp, stage, is, sometimes, secondarily, lost, the, subphylum, include, the, major, taxa, scyphozoa, large, jellyfish, cubozoa, box, jellyfish, and, hydrozoa, small, jellyfish, and, excludes, anthozoa, corals, and, sea, anemones, this, suggests, that, the, medusa, form, evolved, after, the, polyps, medusozoans, have, tetramerous, symmetry, with, parts, in, fours, or, multiples, of, four, the, four, major, classes, of, medusozoan, cnidaria, are, there, are, over, 200, species, of, scyphozoa, about, 50, species, of, staurozoa, about, 50, species, of, cubozoa, and, the, hydrozoa, includes, about, 1000, 1500, species, that, produce, medusae, but, many, more, species, that, do, not, since, jellyfish, have, no, hard, parts, fossils, are, rare, the, oldest, unambiguous, fossil, of, a, free, swimming, medusa, is, burgessomedusa, from, the, mid, cambrian, burgess, shale, of, canada, which, is, likely, either, a, stem, group, of, box, jellyfish, cubozoa, or, acraspeda, the, clade, including, staurozoa, cubozoa, and, scyphozoa, other, claimed, records, from, the, cambrian, of, china, and, utah, in, the, united, states, are, uncertain, and, possibly, represent, ctenophores, instead, the, main, feature, of, a, true, jellyfish, is, the, umbrella, shaped, bell, this, is, a, hollow, structure, consisting, of, a, mass, of, transparent, jelly, like, matter, known, as, mesoglea, which, forms, the, hydrostatic, skeleton, of, the, animal, the, mesoglea, is, 95, or, more, composed, of, water, and, also, contains, collagen, and, other, fibrous, proteins, as, well, as, wandering, amebocytes, that, can, engulf, debris, and, bacteria, the, mesogloea, is, bordered, by, the, epidermis, on, the, outside, and, the, gastrodermis, on, the, inside, the, edge, of, the, bell, is, often, divided, into, rounded, lobes, known, as, lappets, which, allow, the, bell, to, flex, in, the, gaps, or, niches, between, the, lappets, are, dangling, rudimentary, sense, organs, known, as, rhopalia, and, the, margin, of, the, bell, often, bears, tentacles, on, the, underside, of, the, bell, is, the, manubrium, a, stalk, like, structure, hanging, down, from, the, centre, with, the, mouth, which, also, functions, as, the, anus, at, its, tip, there, are, often, four, oral, arms, connected, to, the, manubrium, streaming, away, into, the, water, below, the, mouth, opens, into, the, gastrovascular, cavity, where, digestion, takes, place, and, nutrients, are, absorbed, this, is, subdivided, by, four, thick, septa, into, a, central, stomach, and, four, gastric, pockets, the, four, pairs, of, gonads, are, attached, to, the, septa, and, close, to, them, four, septal, funnels, open, to, the, exterior, perhaps, supplying, good, oxygenation, to, the, gonads, near, the, free, edges, of, the, septa, gastric, filaments, extend, into, the, gastric, cavity, these, are, armed, with, nematocysts, and, enzyme, producing, cells, and, play, a, role, in, subduing, and, digesting, the, prey, in, some, scyphozoans, the, gastric, cavity, is, joined, to, radial, canals, which, branch, extensively, and, may, join, a, marginal, ring, canal, cilia, in, these, canals, circulate, the, fluid, in, a, regular, direction, the, box, jellyfish, is, largely, similar, in, structure, it, has, a, squarish, box, like, bell, a, short, pedalium, or, stalk, hangs, from, each, of, the, four, lower, corners, one, or, more, long, slender, tentacles, are, attached, to, each, pedalium, the, rim, of, the, bell, is, folded, inwards, to, form, a, shelf, known, as, a, velarium, which, restricts, the, bell, s, aperture, and, creates, a, powerful, jet, when, the, bell, pulsates, allowing, box, jellyfish, to, swim, faster, than, true, jellyfish, hydrozoans, are, also, similar, usually, with, just, four, tentacles, at, the, edge, of, the, bell, although, many, hydrozoans, are, colonial, and, may, not, have, a, free, living, medusal, stage, in, some, species, a, non, detachable, bud, known, as, a, gonophore, is, formed, that, contains, a, gonad, but, is, missing, many, other, medusal, features, such, as, tentacles, and, rhopalia, stalked, jellyfish, are, attached, to, a, solid, surface, by, a, basal, disk, and, resemble, a, polyp, the, oral, end, of, which, has, partially, developed, into, a, medusa, with, tentacle, bearing, lobes, and, a, central, manubrium, with, four, sided, mouth, most, jellyfish, do, not, have, specialized, systems, for, osmoregulation, respiration, and, circulation, and, do, not, have, a, central, nervous, system, nematocysts, which, deliver, the, sting, are, located, mostly, on, the, tentacles, true, jellyfish, also, have, them, around, the, mouth, and, stomach, jellyfish, do, not, need, a, respiratory, system, because, sufficient, oxygen, diffuses, through, the, epidermis, they, have, limited, control, over, their, movement, but, can, navigate, with, the, pulsations, of, the, bell, like, body, some, species, are, active, swimmers, most, of, the, time, while, others, largely, drift, the, rhopalia, contain, rudimentary, sense, organs, which, are, able, to, detect, light, water, borne, vibrations, odour, and, orientation, a, loose, network, of, nerves, called, a, nerve, net, is, located, in, the, epidermis, although, traditionally, thought, not, to, have, a, central, nervous, system, nerve, net, concentration, and, ganglion, like, structures, could, be, considered, to, constitute, one, in, most, species, a, jellyfish, detects, stimuli, and, transmits, impulses, both, throughout, the, nerve, net, and, around, a, circular, nerve, ring, to, other, nerve, cells, the, rhopalial, ganglia, contain, pacemaker, neurones, which, control, swimming, rate, and, direction, in, many, species, of, jellyfish, the, rhopalia, include, ocelli, light, sensitive, organs, able, to, tell, light, from, dark, these, are, generally, pigment, spot, ocelli, which, have, some, of, their, cells, pigmented, the, rhopalia, are, suspended, on, stalks, with, heavy, crystals, at, one, end, acting, like, gyroscopes, to, orient, the, eyes, skyward, certain, jellyfish, look, upward, at, the, mangrove, canopy, while, making, a, daily, migration, from, mangrove, swamps, into, the, open, lagoon, where, they, feed, and, back, again, box, jellyfish, have, more, advanced, vision, than, the, other, groups, each, individual, has, 24, eyes, two, of, which, are, capable, of, seeing, colour, and, four, parallel, information, processing, areas, that, act, in, competition, supposedly, making, them, one, of, the, few, kinds, of, animal, to, have, a, 360, degree, view, of, its, environment, the, study, of, jellyfish, eye, evolution, is, an, intermediary, to, a, better, understanding, of, how, visual, systems, evolved, on, earth, jellyfish, exhibit, immense, variation, in, visual, systems, ranging, from, photoreceptive, cell, patches, seen, in, simple, photoreceptive, systems, to, more, derived, complex, eyes, seen, in, box, jellyfish, major, topics, of, jellyfish, visual, system, research, with, an, emphasis, on, box, jellyfish, include, the, evolution, of, jellyfish, vision, from, simple, to, complex, visual, systems, the, eye, morphology, and, molecular, structures, of, box, jellyfish, including, comparisons, to, vertebrate, eyes, and, various, uses, of, vision, including, task, guided, behaviors, and, niche, specialization, experimental, evidence, for, photosensitivity, and, photoreception, in, cnidarians, antecedes, the, mid, 1900s, and, a, rich, body, of, research, has, since, covered, evolution, of, visual, systems, in, jellyfish, jellyfish, visual, systems, range, from, simple, photoreceptive, cells, to, complex, image, forming, eyes, more, ancestral, visual, systems, incorporate, extraocular, vision, vision, without, eyes, that, encompass, numerous, receptors, dedicated, to, single, function, behaviors, more, derived, visual, systems, comprise, perception, that, is, capable, of, multiple, task, guided, behaviors, although, they, lack, a, true, brain, cnidarian, jellyfish, have, a, ring, nervous, system, that, plays, a, significant, role, in, motor, and, sensory, activity, this, net, of, nerves, is, responsible, for, muscle, contraction, and, movement, and, culminates, the, emergence, of, photosensitive, structures, across, cnidaria, there, is, large, variation, in, the, systems, that, underlie, photosensitivity, photosensitive, structures, range, from, non, specialized, groups, of, cells, to, more, conventional, eyes, similar, to, those, of, vertebrates, the, general, evolutionary, steps, to, develop, complex, vision, include, from, more, ancestral, to, more, derived, states, non, directional, photoreception, directional, photoreception, low, resolution, vision, and, high, resolution, vision, increased, habitat, and, task, complexity, has, favored, the, high, resolution, visual, systems, common, in, derived, cnidarians, such, as, box, jellyfish, basal, visual, systems, observed, in, various, cnidarians, exhibit, photosensitivity, representative, of, a, single, task, or, behavior, extraocular, photoreception, a, form, of, non, directional, photoreception, is, the, most, basic, form, of, light, sensitivity, and, guides, a, variety, of, behaviors, among, cnidarians, it, can, function, to, regulate, circadian, rhythm, as, seen, in, eyeless, hydrozoans, and, other, light, guided, behaviors, responsive, to, the, intensity, and, spectrum, of, light, extraocular, photoreception, can, function, additionally, in, positive, phototaxis, in, planula, larvae, of, hydrozoans, as, well, as, in, avoiding, harmful, amounts, of, uv, radiation, via, negative, phototaxis, directional, photoreception, the, ability, to, perceive, direction, of, incoming, light, allows, for, more, complex, phototactic, responses, to, light, and, likely, evolved, by, means, of, membrane, stacking, the, resulting, behavioral, responses, can, range, from, guided, spawning, events, timed, by, moonlight, to, shadow, responses, for, potential, predator, avoidance, light, guided, behaviors, are, observed, in, numerous, scyphozoans, including, the, common, moon, jelly, aurelia, aurita, which, migrates, in, response, to, changes, in, ambient, light, and, solar, position, even, though, they, lack, proper, eyes, the, low, resolution, visual, system, of, box, jellyfish, is, more, derived, than, directional, photoreception, and, thus, box, jellyfish, vision, represents, the, most, basic, form, of, true, vision, in, which, multiple, directional, photoreceptors, combine, to, create, the, first, imaging, and, spatial, resolution, this, is, different, from, the, high, resolution, vision, that, is, observed, in, camera, or, compound, eyes, of, vertebrates, and, cephalopods, that, rely, on, focusing, optics, critically, the, visual, systems, of, box, jellyfish, are, responsible, for, guiding, multiple, tasks, or, behaviors, in, contrast, to, less, derived, visual, systems, in, other, jellyfish, that, guide, single, behavioral, functions, these, behaviors, include, phototaxis, based, on, sunlight, positive, or, shadows, negative, obstacle, avoidance, and, control, of, swim, pulse, rate, box, jellyfish, possess, proper, eyes, similar, to, vertebrates, that, allow, them, to, inhabit, environments, that, lesser, derived, medusae, cannot, in, fact, they, are, considered, the, only, class, in, the, clade, medusozoa, that, have, behaviors, necessitating, spatial, resolution, and, genuine, vision, however, the, lens, in, their, eyes, are, more, functionally, similar, to, cup, eyes, exhibited, in, low, resolution, organisms, and, have, very, little, to, no, focusing, capability, the, lack, of, the, ability, to, focus, is, due, to, the, focal, length, exceeding, the, distance, to, the, retina, thus, generating, unfocused, images, and, limiting, spatial, resolution, the, visual, system, is, still, sufficient, for, box, jellyfish, to, produce, an, image, to, help, with, tasks, such, as, object, avoidance, box, jellyfish, eyes, are, a, visual, system, that, is, sophisticated, in, numerous, ways, these, intricacies, include, the, considerable, variation, within, the, morphology, of, box, jellyfishes, eyes, including, their, task, behavior, specification, and, the, molecular, makeup, of, their, eyes, including, photoreceptors, opsins, lenses, and, synapses, the, comparison, of, these, attributes, to, more, derived, visual, systems, can, allow, for, a, further, understanding, of, how, the, evolution, of, more, derived, visual, systems, may, have, occurred, and, puts, into, perspective, how, box, jellyfish, can, play, the, role, as, an, evolutionary, developmental, model, for, all, visual, systems, box, jellyfish, visual, systems, are, both, diverse, and, complex, comprising, multiple, photosystems, there, is, likely, considerable, variation, in, visual, properties, between, species, of, box, jellyfish, given, the, significant, inter, species, morphological, and, physiological, variation, eyes, tend, to, differ, in, size, and, shape, along, with, number, of, receptors, including, opsins, and, physiology, across, species, of, box, jellyfish, box, jellyfish, have, a, series, of, intricate, lensed, eyes, that, are, similar, to, those, of, more, derived, multicellular, organisms, such, as, vertebrates, their, 24, eyes, fit, into, four, different, morphological, categories, these, categories, consist, of, two, large, morphologically, different, medial, eyes, a, lower, and, upper, lensed, eye, containing, spherical, lenses, a, lateral, pair, of, pigment, slit, eyes, and, a, lateral, pair, of, pigment, pit, eyes, the, eyes, are, situated, on, rhopalia, small, sensory, structures, which, serve, sensory, functions, of, the, box, jellyfish, and, arise, from, the, cavities, of, the, exumbrella, the, surface, of, the, body, on, the, side, of, the, bells, of, the, jellyfish, the, two, large, eyes, are, located, on, the, mid, line, of, the, club, and, are, considered, complex, because, they, contain, lenses, the, four, remaining, eyes, lie, laterally, on, either, side, of, each, rhopalia, and, are, considered, simple, the, simple, eyes, are, observed, as, small, invaginated, cups, of, epithelium, that, have, developed, pigmentation, the, larger, of, the, complex, eyes, contains, a, cellular, cornea, created, by, a, mono, ciliated, epithelium, cellular, lens, homogenous, capsule, to, the, lens, vitreous, body, with, prismatic, elements, and, a, retina, of, pigmented, cells, the, smaller, of, the, complex, eyes, is, said, to, be, slightly, less, complex, given, that, it, lacks, a, capsule, but, otherwise, contains, the, same, structure, as, the, larger, eye, box, jellyfish, have, multiple, photosystems, that, comprise, different, sets, of, eyes, evidence, includes, immunocytochemical, and, molecular, data, that, show, photopigment, differences, among, the, different, morphological, eye, types, and, physiological, experiments, done, on, box, jellyfish, to, suggest, behavioral, differences, among, photosystems, each, individual, eye, type, constitutes, photosystems, that, work, collectively, to, control, visually, guided, behaviors, box, jellyfish, eyes, primarily, use, c, prcs, ciliary, photoreceptor, cells, similar, to, that, of, vertebrate, eyes, these, cells, undergo, phototransduction, cascades, process, of, light, absorption, by, photoreceptors, that, are, triggered, by, c, opsins, available, opsin, sequences, suggest, that, there, are, two, types, of, opsins, possessed, by, all, cnidarians, including, an, ancient, phylogenetic, opsin, and, a, sister, ciliary, opsin, to, the, c, opsins, group, box, jellyfish, could, have, both, ciliary, and, cnidops, cnidarian, opsins, which, is, something, not, previously, believed, to, appear, in, the, same, retina, nevertheless, it, is, not, entirely, evident, whether, cnidarians, possess, multiple, opsins, that, are, capable, of, having, distinctive, spectral, sensitivities, comparative, research, on, genetic, and, molecular, makeup, of, box, jellyfishes, eyes, versus, more, derived, eyes, seen, in, vertebrates, and, cephalopods, focuses, on, lenses, and, crystallin, composition, synapses, and, pax, genes, and, their, implied, evidence, for, shared, primordial, ancestral, genes, in, eye, evolution, box, jellyfish, eyes, are, said, to, be, an, evolutionary, developmental, model, of, all, eyes, based, on, their, evolutionary, recruitment, of, crystallins, and, pax, genes, research, done, on, box, jellyfish, including, tripedalia, cystophora, has, suggested, that, they, possess, a, single, pax, gene, paxb, paxb, functions, by, binding, to, crystallin, promoters, and, activating, them, paxb, in, situ, hybridization, resulted, in, paxb, expression, in, the, lens, retina, and, statocysts, these, results, and, the, rejection, of, the, prior, hypothesis, that, pax6, was, an, ancestral, pax, gene, in, eyes, has, led, to, the, conclusion, that, paxb, was, a, primordial, gene, in, eye, evolution, and, that, the, eyes, of, all, organisms, likely, share, a, common, ancestor, the, lens, structure, of, box, jellyfish, appears, very, similar, to, those, of, other, organisms, but, the, crystallins, are, distinct, in, both, function, and, appearance, weak, reactions, were, seen, within, the, sera, and, there, were, very, weak, sequence, similarities, within, the, crystallins, among, vertebrate, and, invertebrate, lenses, this, is, likely, due, to, differences, in, lower, molecular, weight, proteins, and, the, subsequent, lack, of, immunological, reactions, with, antisera, that, other, organisms, lenses, exhibit, all, four, of, the, visual, systems, of, box, jellyfish, species, investigated, with, detail, carybdea, marsupialis, chiropsalmus, quadrumanus, tamoya, haplonema, and, tripedalia, cystophora, have, invaginated, synapses, but, only, in, the, upper, and, lower, lensed, eyes, different, densities, were, found, between, the, upper, and, lower, lenses, and, between, species, four, types, of, chemical, synapses, have, been, discovered, within, the, rhopalia, which, could, help, in, understanding, neural, organization, including, clear, unidirectional, dense, core, unidirectional, clear, bidirectional, and, clear, and, dense, core, bidirectional, the, synapses, of, the, lensed, eyes, could, be, useful, as, markers, to, learn, more, about, the, neural, circuit, in, box, jellyfish, retinal, areas, the, primary, adaptive, responses, to, environmental, variation, observed, in, box, jellyfish, eyes, include, pupillary, constriction, speeds, in, response, to, light, environments, as, well, as, photoreceptor, tuning, and, lens, adaptations, to, better, respond, to, shifts, between, light, environments, and, darkness, interestingly, some, box, jellyfish, species, eyes, appear, to, have, evolved, more, focused, vision, in, response, to, their, habitat, pupillary, contraction, appears, to, have, evolved, in, response, to, variation, in, the, light, environment, across, ecological, niches, across, three, species, of, box, jellyfish, chironex, fleckeri, chiropsella, bronzie, and, carukia, barnesi, behavioral, studies, suggest, that, faster, pupil, contraction, rates, allow, for, greater, object, avoidance, and, in, fact, species, with, more, complex, habitats, exhibit, faster, rates, ch, bronzie, inhabit, shallow, beach, fronts, that, have, low, visibility, and, very, few, obstacles, thus, faster, pupil, contraction, in, response, to, objects, in, their, environment, is, not, important, ca, barnesi, and, ch, fleckeri, are, found, in, more, three, dimensionally, complex, environments, like, mangroves, with, an, abundance, of, natural, obstacles, where, faster, pupil, contraction, is, more, adaptive, behavioral, studies, support, the, idea, that, faster, pupillary, contraction, rates, assist, with, obstacle, avoidance, as, well, as, depth, adjustments, in, response, to, differing, light, intensities, light, dark, adaptation, via, pupillary, light, reflexes, is, an, additional, form, of, an, evolutionary, response, to, the, light, environment, this, relates, to, the, pupil, s, response, to, shifts, between, light, intensity, generally, from, sunlight, to, darkness, in, the, process, of, light, dark, adaptation, the, upper, and, lower, lens, eyes, of, different, box, jellyfish, species, vary, in, specific, function, the, lower, lens, eyes, contain, pigmented, photoreceptors, and, long, pigment, cells, with, dark, pigments, that, migrate, on, light, dark, adaptation, while, the, upper, lens, eyes, play, a, concentrated, role, in, light, direction, and, phototaxis, given, that, they, face, upward, towards, the, water, surface, towards, the, sun, or, moon, the, upper, lens, of, ch, bronzie, does, not, exhibit, any, considerable, optical, power, while, tr, cystophora, a, box, jellyfish, species, that, tends, to, live, in, mangroves, does, the, ability, to, use, light, to, visually, guide, behavior, is, not, of, as, much, importance, to, ch, bronzie, as, it, is, to, species, in, more, obstacle, filled, environments, differences, in, visually, guided, behavior, serve, as, evidence, that, species, that, share, the, same, number, and, structure, of, eyes, can, exhibit, differences, in, how, they, control, behavior, jellyfish, range, from, about, one, millimeter, in, bell, height, and, diameter, to, nearly, 2, metres, 6, 1, 2, ft, in, bell, height, and, diameter, the, tentacles, and, mouth, parts, usually, extend, beyond, this, bell, dimension, the, smallest, jellyfish, are, the, peculiar, creeping, jellyfish, in, the, genera, staurocladia, and, eleutheria, which, have, bell, disks, from, 0, 5, millimetres, 1, 32, in, to, a, few, millimeters, in, diameter, with, short, tentacles, that, extend, out, beyond, this, which, these, jellyfish, use, to, move, across, the, surface, of, seaweed, or, the, bottoms, of, rocky, pools, many, of, these, tiny, creeping, jellyfish, cannot, be, seen, in, the, field, without, a, hand, lens, or, microscope, they, can, reproduce, asexually, by, fission, splitting, in, half, other, very, small, jellyfish, which, have, bells, about, one, millimeter, are, the, hydromedusae, of, many, species, that, have, just, been, released, from, their, parent, polyps, some, of, these, live, only, a, few, minutes, before, shedding, their, gametes, in, the, plankton, and, then, dying, while, others, will, grow, in, the, plankton, for, weeks, or, months, the, hydromedusae, cladonema, radiatum, and, cladonema, californicum, are, also, very, small, living, for, months, yet, never, growing, beyond, a, few, mm, in, bell, height, and, diameter, the, lion, s, mane, jellyfish, cyanea, capillata, was, long, cited, as, the, largest, jellyfish, and, arguably, the, longest, animal, in, the, world, with, fine, thread, like, tentacles, that, may, extend, up, to, 36, 5, m, 119, ft, 9, in, long, though, most, are, nowhere, near, that, large, they, have, a, moderately, painful, but, rarely, fatal, sting, the, increasingly, common, giant, nomura, s, jellyfish, nemopilema, nomurai, found, in, some, but, not, all, years, in, the, waters, of, japan, korea, and, china, in, summer, and, autumn, is, another, candidate, for, largest, jellyfish, in, terms, of, diameter, and, weight, since, the, largest, nomura, s, jellyfish, in, late, autumn, can, reach, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, in, bell, body, diameter, and, about, 200, kg, 440, lb, in, weight, with, average, specimens, frequently, reaching, 0, 9, m, 2, ft, 11, in, in, bell, diameter, and, about, 150, kg, 330, lb, in, weight, the, large, bell, mass, of, the, giant, nomura, s, jellyfish, can, dwarf, a, diver, and, is, nearly, always, much, greater, than, the, lion, s, mane, whose, bell, diameter, can, reach, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, the, rarely, encountered, deep, sea, jellyfish, stygiomedusa, gigantea, is, another, candidate, for, largest, jellyfish, with, its, thick, massive, bell, up, to, 100, cm, 3, ft, 3, in, wide, and, four, thick, strap, like, oral, arms, extending, up, to, 6, m, 19, 1, 2, ft, in, length, very, different, from, the, typical, fine, threadlike, tentacles, that, rim, the, umbrella, of, more, typical, looking, jellyfish, including, the, lion, s, mane, desmonema, glaciale, which, lives, in, the, antarctic, region, can, reach, a, very, large, size, several, meters, purple, striped, jelly, chrysaora, colorata, can, also, be, extremely, long, up, to, 15, feet, jellyfish, have, a, complex, life, cycle, which, includes, both, sexual, and, asexual, phases, with, the, medusa, being, the, sexual, stage, in, most, instances, sperm, fertilize, eggs, which, develop, into, larval, planulae, become, polyps, bud, into, ephyrae, and, then, transform, into, adult, medusae, in, some, species, certain, stages, may, be, skipped, upon, reaching, adult, size, jellyfish, spawn, regularly, if, there, is, a, sufficient, supply, of, food, in, most, species, spawning, is, controlled, by, light, with, all, individuals, spawning, at, about, the, same, time, of, day, in, many, instances, this, is, at, dawn, or, dusk, jellyfish, are, usually, either, male, or, female, with, occasional, hermaphrodites, in, most, cases, adults, release, sperm, and, eggs, into, the, surrounding, water, where, the, unprotected, eggs, are, fertilized, and, develop, into, larvae, in, a, few, species, the, sperm, swim, into, the, female, s, mouth, fertilizing, the, eggs, within, her, body, where, they, remain, during, early, development, stages, in, moon, jellies, the, eggs, lodge, in, pits, on, the, oral, arms, which, form, a, temporary, brood, chamber, for, the, developing, planula, larvae, the, planula, is, a, small, larva, covered, with, cilia, when, sufficiently, developed, it, settles, onto, a, firm, surface, and, develops, into, a, polyp, the, polyp, generally, consists, of, a, small, stalk, topped, by, a, mouth, that, is, ringed, by, upward, facing, tentacles, the, polyps, resemble, those, of, closely, related, anthozoans, such, as, sea, anemones, and, corals, the, jellyfish, polyp, may, be, sessile, living, on, the, bottom, of, boat, hulls, or, other, substrates, or, it, may, be, free, floating, or, attached, to, tiny, bits, of, free, living, plankton, or, rarely, fish, or, other, invertebrates, polyps, may, be, solitary, or, colonial, most, polyps, are, only, millimetres, in, diameter, and, feed, continuously, the, polyp, stage, may, last, for, years, after, an, interval, and, stimulated, by, seasonal, or, hormonal, changes, the, polyp, may, begin, reproducing, asexually, by, budding, and, in, the, scyphozoa, is, called, a, segmenting, polyp, or, a, scyphistoma, budding, produces, more, scyphistomae, and, also, ephyrae, budding, sites, vary, by, species, from, the, tentacle, bulbs, the, manubrium, above, the, mouth, or, the, gonads, of, hydromedusae, in, a, process, known, as, strobilation, the, polyp, s, tentacles, are, reabsorbed, and, the, body, starts, to, narrow, forming, transverse, constrictions, in, several, places, near, the, upper, extremity, of, the, polyp, these, deepen, as, the, constriction, sites, migrate, down, the, body, and, separate, segments, known, as, ephyra, detach, these, are, free, swimming, precursors, of, the, adult, medusa, stage, which, is, the, life, stage, that, is, typically, identified, as, a, jellyfish, the, ephyrae, usually, only, a, millimeter, or, two, across, initially, swim, away, from, the, polyp, and, grow, limnomedusae, polyps, can, asexually, produce, a, creeping, frustule, larval, form, which, crawls, away, before, developing, into, another, polyp, a, few, species, can, produce, new, medusae, by, budding, directly, from, the, medusan, stage, some, hydromedusae, reproduce, by, fission, little, is, known, of, the, life, histories, of, many, jellyfish, as, the, places, on, the, seabed, where, the, benthic, forms, of, those, species, live, have, not, been, found, however, an, asexually, reproducing, strobila, form, can, sometimes, live, for, several, years, producing, new, medusae, ephyra, larvae, each, year, an, unusual, species, turritopsis, dohrnii, formerly, classified, as, turritopsis, nutricula, might, be, effectively, immortal, because, of, its, ability, under, certain, circumstances, to, transform, from, medusa, back, to, the, polyp, stage, thereby, escaping, the, death, that, typically, awaits, medusae, post, reproduction, if, they, have, not, otherwise, been, eaten, by, some, other, organism, so, far, this, reversal, has, been, observed, only, in, the, laboratory, using, the, moon, jelly, aurelia, aurita, as, an, example, jellyfish, have, been, shown, to, be, the, most, energy, efficient, swimmers, of, all, animals, they, move, through, the, water, by, radially, expanding, and, contracting, their, bell, shaped, bodies, to, push, water, behind, them, they, pause, between, the, contraction, and, expansion, phases, to, create, two, vortex, rings, muscles, are, used, for, the, contraction, of, the, body, which, creates, the, first, vortex, and, pushes, the, animal, forward, but, the, mesoglea, is, so, elastic, that, the, expansion, is, powered, exclusively, by, relaxing, the, bell, which, releases, the, energy, stored, from, the, contraction, meanwhile, the, second, vortex, ring, starts, to, spin, faster, sucking, water, into, the, bell, and, pushing, against, the, centre, of, the, body, giving, a, secondary, and, free, boost, forward, the, mechanism, called, passive, energy, recapture, only, works, in, relatively, small, jellyfish, moving, at, low, speeds, allowing, the, animal, to, travel, 30, percent, farther, on, each, swimming, cycle, jellyfish, achieved, a, 48, percent, lower, cost, of, transport, food, and, oxygen, intake, versus, energy, spent, in, movement, than, other, animals, in, similar, studies, one, reason, for, this, is, that, most, of, the, gelatinous, tissue, of, the, bell, is, inactive, using, no, energy, during, swimming, jellyfish, are, like, other, cnidarians, generally, carnivorous, or, parasitic, feeding, on, planktonic, organisms, crustaceans, small, fish, fish, eggs, and, larvae, and, other, jellyfish, ingesting, food, and, voiding, undigested, waste, through, the, mouth, they, hunt, passively, using, their, tentacles, as, drift, lines, or, sink, through, the, water, with, their, tentacles, spread, widely, the, tentacles, which, contain, nematocysts, to, stun, or, kill, the, prey, may, then, flex, to, help, bring, it, to, the, mouth, their, swimming, technique, also, helps, them, to, capture, prey, when, their, bell, expands, it, sucks, in, water, which, brings, more, potential, prey, within, reach, of, the, tentacles, a, few, species, such, as, aglaura, hemistoma, are, omnivorous, feeding, on, microplankton, which, is, a, mixture, of, zooplankton, and, phytoplankton, microscopic, plants, such, as, dinoflagellates, others, harbour, mutualistic, algae, zooxanthellae, in, their, tissues, the, spotted, jellyfish, mastigias, papua, is, typical, of, these, deriving, part, of, its, nutrition, from, the, products, of, photosynthesis, and, part, from, captured, zooplankton, the, upside, down, jellyfish, cassiopea, andromeda, also, has, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, microalgae, but, captures, tiny, animals, to, supplement, their, diet, this, is, done, by, releasing, tiny, balls, of, living, cells, composed, of, mesoglea, these, use, cilia, to, drive, them, through, water, and, stinging, cells, which, stun, the, prey, the, blobs, also, seems, to, have, digestive, capabilities, other, species, of, jellyfish, are, among, the, most, common, and, important, jellyfish, predators, sea, anemones, may, eat, jellyfish, that, drift, into, their, range, other, predators, include, tunas, sharks, swordfish, sea, turtles, and, penguins, jellyfish, washed, up, on, the, beach, are, consumed, by, foxes, other, terrestrial, mammals, and, birds, in, general, however, few, animals, prey, on, jellyfish, they, can, broadly, be, considered, to, be, top, predators, in, the, food, chain, once, jellyfish, have, become, dominant, in, an, ecosystem, for, example, through, overfishing, which, removes, predators, of, jellyfish, larvae, there, may, be, no, obvious, way, for, the, previous, balance, to, be, restored, they, eat, fish, eggs, and, juvenile, fish, and, compete, with, fish, for, food, preventing, fish, stocks, from, recovering, some, small, fish, are, immune, to, the, stings, of, the, jellyfish, and, live, among, the, tentacles, serving, as, bait, in, a, fish, trap, they, are, safe, from, potential, predators, and, are, able, to, share, the, fish, caught, by, the, jellyfish, the, cannonball, jellyfish, has, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, ten, different, species, of, fish, and, with, the, longnose, spider, crab, which, lives, inside, the, bell, sharing, the, jellyfish, s, food, and, nibbling, its, tissues, jellyfish, form, large, masses, or, blooms, in, certain, environmental, conditions, of, ocean, currents, nutrients, sunshine, temperature, season, prey, availability, reduced, predation, and, oxygen, concentration, currents, collect, jellyfish, together, especially, in, years, with, unusually, high, populations, jellyfish, can, detect, marine, currents, and, swim, against, the, current, to, congregate, in, blooms, jellyfish, are, better, able, to, survive, in, nutrient, rich, oxygen, poor, water, than, competitors, and, thus, can, feast, on, plankton, without, competition, jellyfish, may, also, benefit, from, saltier, waters, as, saltier, waters, contain, more, iodine, which, is, necessary, for, polyps, to, turn, into, jellyfish, rising, sea, temperatures, caused, by, climate, change, may, also, contribute, to, jellyfish, blooms, because, many, species, of, jellyfish, are, able, to, survive, in, warmer, waters, increased, nutrients, from, agricultural, or, urban, runoff, with, nutrients, including, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, compounds, increase, the, growth, of, phytoplankton, causing, eutrophication, and, algal, blooms, when, the, phytoplankton, die, they, may, create, dead, zones, so, called, because, they, are, hypoxic, low, in, oxygen, this, in, turn, kills, fish, and, other, animals, but, not, jellyfish, allowing, them, to, bloom, jellyfish, populations, may, be, expanding, globally, as, a, result, of, land, runoff, and, overfishing, of, their, natural, predators, jellyfish, are, well, placed, to, benefit, from, disturbance, of, marine, ecosystems, they, reproduce, rapidly, they, prey, upon, many, species, while, few, species, prey, on, them, and, they, feed, via, touch, rather, than, visually, so, they, can, feed, effectively, at, night, and, in, turbid, waters, it, may, be, difficult, for, fish, stocks, to, re, establish, themselves, in, marine, ecosystems, once, they, have, become, dominated, by, jellyfish, because, jellyfish, feed, on, plankton, which, includes, fish, eggs, and, larvae, as, suspected, at, the, turn, of, this, century, jellyfish, blooms, are, increasing, in, frequency, between, 2013, and, 2020, the, mediterranean, science, commission, monitored, on, a, weekly, basis, the, frequency, of, such, outbreaks, in, coastal, waters, from, morocco, to, the, black, sea, revealing, a, relatively, high, frequency, of, these, blooms, nearly, all, year, round, with, peaks, observed, from, march, to, july, and, often, again, in, the, autumn, the, blooms, are, caused, by, different, jellyfish, species, depending, on, their, localisation, within, the, basin, one, observes, a, clear, dominance, of, pelagia, noctiluca, and, velella, velella, outbreaks, in, the, western, mediterranean, of, rhizostoma, pulmo, and, rhopilema, nomadica, outbreaks, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, of, aurelia, aurita, and, mnemiopsis, leidyi, outbreaks, in, the, black, sea, some, jellyfish, populations, that, have, shown, clear, increases, in, the, past, few, decades, are, invasive, species, newly, arrived, from, other, habitats, examples, include, the, black, sea, caspian, sea, baltic, sea, central, and, eastern, mediterranean, hawaii, and, tropical, and, subtropical, parts, of, the, west, atlantic, including, the, caribbean, gulf, of, mexico, and, brazil, jellyfish, blooms, can, have, significant, impact, on, community, structure, some, carnivorous, jellyfish, species, prey, on, zooplankton, while, others, graze, on, primary, producers, reductions, in, zooplankton, and, ichthyoplankton, due, to, a, jellyfish, bloom, can, ripple, through, the, trophic, levels, high, density, jellyfish, populations, can, outcompete, other, predators, and, reduce, fish, recruitment, increased, grazing, on, primary, producers, by, jellyfish, can, also, interrupt, energy, transfer, to, higher, trophic, levels, during, blooms, jellyfish, significantly, alter, the, nutrient, availability, in, their, environment, blooms, require, large, amounts, of, available, organic, nutrients, in, the, water, column, to, grow, limiting, availability, for, other, organisms, some, jellyfish, have, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, single, celled, dinoflagellates, allowing, them, to, assimilate, inorganic, carbon, phosphorus, and, nitrogen, creating, competition, for, phytoplankton, their, large, biomass, makes, them, an, important, source, of, dissolved, and, particulate, organic, matter, for, microbial, communities, through, excretion, mucus, production, and, decomposition, the, microbes, break, down, the, organic, matter, into, inorganic, ammonium, and, phosphate, however, the, low, carbon, availability, shifts, the, process, from, production, to, respiration, creating, low, oxygen, areas, making, the, dissolved, inorganic, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, largely, unavailable, for, primary, production, these, blooms, have, very, real, impacts, on, industries, jellyfish, can, outcompete, fish, by, utilizing, open, niches, in, over, fished, fisheries, catch, of, jellyfish, can, strain, fishing, gear, and, lead, to, expenses, relating, to, damaged, gear, power, plants, have, been, shut, down, due, to, jellyfish, blocking, the, flow, of, cooling, water, blooms, have, also, been, harmful, for, tourism, causing, a, rise, in, stings, and, sometimes, the, closure, of, beaches, jellyfish, form, a, component, of, jelly, falls, events, where, gelatinous, zooplankton, fall, to, the, seafloor, providing, food, for, the, benthic, organisms, there, in, temperate, and, subpolar, regions, jelly, falls, usually, follow, immediately, after, a, bloom, most, jellyfish, are, marine, animals, although, a, few, hydromedusae, inhabit, freshwater, the, best, known, freshwater, example, is, the, cosmopolitan, hydrozoan, jellyfish, craspedacusta, sowerbii, it, is, less, than, an, inch, 2, 5, cm, in, diameter, colorless, and, does, not, sting, some, jellyfish, populations, have, become, restricted, to, coastal, saltwater, lakes, such, as, jellyfish, lake, in, palau, jellyfish, lake, is, a, marine, lake, where, millions, of, golden, jellyfish, mastigias, spp, migrate, horizontally, across, the, lake, daily, although, most, jellyfish, live, well, off, the, ocean, floor, and, form, part, of, the, plankton, a, few, species, are, closely, associated, with, the, bottom, for, much, of, their, lives, and, can, be, considered, benthic, the, upside, down, jellyfish, in, the, genus, cassiopea, typically, lie, on, the, bottom, of, shallow, lagoons, where, they, sometimes, pulsate, gently, with, their, umbrella, top, facing, down, even, some, deep, sea, species, of, hydromedusae, and, scyphomedusae, are, usually, collected, on, or, near, the, bottom, all, of, the, stauromedusae, are, found, attached, to, either, seaweed, or, rocky, or, other, firm, material, on, the, bottom, some, species, explicitly, adapt, to, tidal, flux, in, roscoe, bay, jellyfish, ride, the, current, at, ebb, tide, until, they, hit, a, gravel, bar, and, then, descend, below, the, current, they, remain, in, still, waters, until, the, tide, rises, ascending, and, allowing, it, to, sweep, them, back, into, the, bay, they, also, actively, avoid, fresh, water, from, mountain, snowmelt, diving, until, they, find, enough, salt, jellyfish, are, hosts, to, a, wide, variety, of, parasitic, organisms, they, act, as, intermediate, hosts, of, endoparasitic, helminths, with, the, infection, being, transferred, to, the, definitive, host, fish, after, predation, some, digenean, trematodes, especially, species, in, the, family, lepocreadiidae, use, jellyfish, as, their, second, intermediate, hosts, fish, become, infected, by, the, trematodes, when, they, feed, on, infected, jellyfish, jellyfish, have, long, been, eaten, in, some, parts, of, the, world, fisheries, have, begun, harvesting, the, american, cannonball, jellyfish, stomolophus, meleagris, along, the, southern, atlantic, coast, of, the, united, states, and, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, for, export, to, asia, jellyfish, are, also, harvested, for, their, collagen, which, is, being, investigated, for, use, in, a, variety, of, applications, including, the, treatment, of, rheumatoid, arthritis, aquaculture, and, fisheries, of, other, species, often, suffer, severe, losses, and, so, losses, of, productivity, due, to, jellyfish, aristotle, stated, in, the, parts, of, animals, iv, 6, that, jellyfish, sea, nettles, were, eaten, in, wintertime, in, a, fish, stew, in, some, countries, including, china, japan, and, korea, jellyfish, are, a, delicacy, the, jellyfish, is, dried, to, prevent, spoiling, only, some, 12, species, of, scyphozoan, jellyfish, belonging, to, the, order, rhizostomeae, are, harvested, for, food, mostly, in, southeast, asia, rhizostomes, especially, rhopilema, esculentum, in, china, h, izh, sea, stingers, and, stomolophus, meleagris, cannonball, jellyfish, in, the, united, states, are, favored, because, of, their, larger, and, more, rigid, bodies, and, because, their, toxins, are, harmless, to, humans, traditional, processing, methods, carried, out, by, a, jellyfish, master, involve, a, 20, to, 40, day, multi, phase, procedure, in, which, after, removing, the, gonads, and, mucous, membranes, the, umbrella, and, oral, arms, are, treated, with, a, mixture, of, table, salt, and, alum, and, compressed, processing, makes, the, jellyfish, drier, and, more, acidic, producing, a, crisp, texture, jellyfish, prepared, this, way, retain, 7, 10, of, their, original, weight, and, the, processed, product, consists, of, approximately, 94, water, and, 6, protein, freshly, processed, jellyfish, has, a, white, creamy, color, and, turns, yellow, or, brown, during, prolonged, storage, in, china, processed, jellyfish, are, desalted, by, soaking, in, water, overnight, and, eaten, cooked, or, raw, the, dish, is, often, served, shredded, with, a, dressing, of, oil, soy, sauce, vinegar, and, sugar, or, as, a, salad, with, vegetables, in, japan, cured, jellyfish, are, rinsed, cut, into, strips, and, served, with, vinegar, as, an, appetizer, desalted, ready, to, eat, products, are, also, available, pliny, the, elder, reported, in, his, natural, history, that, the, slime, of, the, jellyfish, pulmo, marinus, produced, light, when, rubbed, on, a, walking, stick, in, 1961, osamu, shimomura, extracted, green, fluorescent, protein, gfp, and, another, bioluminescent, protein, called, aequorin, from, the, large, and, abundant, hydromedusa, aequorea, victoria, while, studying, photoproteins, that, cause, bioluminescence, in, this, species, three, decades, later, douglas, prasher, sequenced, and, cloned, the, gene, for, gfp, martin, chalfie, figured, out, how, to, use, gfp, as, a, fluorescent, marker, of, genes, inserted, into, other, cells, or, organisms, roger, tsien, later, chemically, manipulated, gfp, to, produce, other, fluorescent, colors, to, use, as, markers, in, 2008, shimomura, chalfie, and, tsien, won, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, their, work, with, gfp, man, made, gfp, became, widely, used, as, a, fluorescent, tag, to, show, which, cells, or, tissues, express, specific, genes, the, genetic, engineering, technique, fuses, the, gene, of, interest, to, the, gfp, gene, the, fused, dna, is, then, put, into, a, cell, to, generate, either, a, cell, line, or, via, ivf, techniques, an, entire, animal, bearing, the, gene, in, the, cell, or, animal, the, artificial, gene, turns, on, in, the, same, tissues, and, the, same, time, as, the, normal, gene, making, a, fusion, of, the, normal, protein, with, gfp, attached, to, the, end, illuminating, the, animal, or, cell, reveals, what, tissues, express, that, protein, or, at, what, stage, of, development, the, fluorescence, shows, where, the, gene, is, expressed, jellyfish, are, displayed, in, many, public, aquariums, often, the, tank, s, background, is, blue, and, the, animals, are, illuminated, by, side, light, increasing, the, contrast, between, the, animal, and, the, background, in, natural, conditions, many, jellies, are, so, transparent, that, they, are, nearly, invisible, jellyfish, are, not, adapted, to, closed, spaces, they, depend, on, currents, to, transport, them, from, place, to, place, professional, exhibits, as, in, the, monterey, bay, aquarium, feature, precise, water, flows, typically, in, circular, tanks, to, avoid, trapping, specimens, in, corners, the, outflow, is, spread, out, over, a, large, surface, area, and, the, inflow, enters, as, a, sheet, of, water, in, front, of, the, outflow, so, the, jellyfish, do, not, get, sucked, into, it, as, of, 2009, jellyfish, were, becoming, popular, in, home, aquariums, where, they, require, similar, equipment, jellyfish, are, armed, with, nematocysts, a, type, of, specialized, stinging, cell, contact, with, a, jellyfish, tentacle, can, trigger, millions, of, nematocysts, to, pierce, the, skin, and, inject, venom, but, only, some, species, venom, causes, an, adverse, reaction, in, humans, in, a, study, published, in, communications, biology, researchers, found, a, jellyfish, species, called, cassiopea, xamachana, which, when, triggered, will, release, tiny, balls, of, cells, that, swim, around, the, jellyfish, stinging, everything, in, their, path, researchers, described, these, as, self, propelling, microscopic, grenades, and, named, them, cassiosomes, the, effects, of, stings, range, from, mild, discomfort, to, extreme, pain, and, death, most, jellyfish, stings, are, not, deadly, but, stings, of, some, box, jellyfish, irukandji, jellyfish, such, as, the, sea, wasp, can, be, deadly, stings, may, cause, anaphylaxis, a, form, of, shock, which, can, be, fatal, jellyfish, kill, 20, to, 40, people, a, year, in, the, philippines, alone, in, 2006, the, spanish, red, cross, treated, 19, 000, stung, swimmers, along, the, costa, brava, vinegar, 3, 10, aqueous, acetic, acid, may, help, with, box, jellyfish, stings, but, not, the, stings, of, the, portuguese, man, o, war, clearing, the, area, of, jelly, and, tentacles, reduces, nematocyst, firing, scraping, the, affected, skin, such, as, with, the, edge, of, a, credit, card, may, remove, remaining, nematocysts, once, the, skin, has, been, cleaned, of, nematocysts, hydrocortisone, cream, applied, locally, reduces, pain,
