and, see, text, a, chordate, k, r, d, e, t, kor, dayt, is, a, deuterostomic, bilaterial, animal, belonging, to, the, phylum, chordata, k, r, d, e, t, kor, day, t, all, chordates, possess, at, some, point, during, their, larval, or, adult, stages, five, distinctive, physical, characteristics, synapomorphies, that, distinguish, them, from, other, taxa, these, five, synapomorphies, are, a, notochord, a, hollow, dorsal, nerve, cord, an, endostyle, or, thyroid, pharyngeal, slits, and, a, post, anal, tail, the, name, chordate, comes, from, the, first, of, these, synapomorphies, the, notochord, which, plays, a, significant, role, in, chordate, body, plan, structuring, and, movements, chordates, are, also, bilaterally, symmetric, have, a, coelom, possess, a, closed, circulatory, system, and, exhibit, metameric, segmentation, in, addition, to, the, morphological, characteristics, used, to, define, chordates, analysis, of, genome, sequences, has, identified, two, conserved, signature, indels, csis, in, their, proteins, cyclophilin, like, protein, and, inner, mitochondrial, membrane, protease, atp23, which, are, exclusively, shared, by, all, vertebrates, tunicates, and, cephalochordates, these, csis, provide, molecular, means, to, reliably, distinguish, chordates, from, all, other, animals, chordates, are, divided, into, three, subphyla, vertebrata, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, whose, notochords, are, replaced, by, a, cartilaginous, bony, axial, endoskeleton, spine, and, are, cladistically, and, phylogenetically, a, subgroup, of, the, clade, craniata, i, e, chordates, with, a, skull, tunicata, or, urochordata, sea, squirts, salps, and, larvaceans, which, only, retain, the, synapomorphies, during, their, larval, stage, and, cephalochordata, lancelets, which, resemble, fish, but, have, no, gills, the, vertebrates, and, tunicates, compose, the, clade, olfactores, which, is, sister, to, cephalochordata, see, diagram, under, phylogeny, extinct, taxa, such, as, the, conodonts, are, chordates, but, their, internal, placement, is, less, certain, hemichordata, which, includes, the, acorn, worms, was, previously, considered, a, fourth, chordate, subphylum, but, now, is, treated, as, a, separate, phylum, which, are, now, thought, to, be, closer, to, the, echinoderms, and, together, they, form, the, clade, ambulacraria, the, sister, phylum, of, the, chordates, chordata, ambulacraria, and, possibly, xenacoelomorpha, are, believed, to, form, the, superphylum, deuterostomia, although, this, has, recently, been, called, into, doubt, chordata, is, the, third, largest, phylum, of, the, animal, kingdom, behind, only, the, protostomic, phyla, arthropoda, and, mollusca, and, is, also, one, of, the, most, ancient, taxons, chordate, fossils, have, been, found, from, as, early, as, the, cambrian, explosion, over, 539, million, years, ago, of, the, more, than, 81, 000, living, species, of, chordates, about, half, are, ray, finned, fishes, class, actinopterygii, and, the, vast, majority, of, the, rest, are, tetrapods, a, terrestrial, clade, of, lobe, finned, fishes, sarcopterygii, who, evolved, air, breathing, using, lungs, although, the, name, chordata, is, attributed, to, william, bateson, 1885, it, was, already, in, prevalent, use, by, 1880, ernst, haeckel, described, a, taxon, comprising, tunicates, cephalochordates, and, vertebrates, in, 1866, though, he, used, the, german, vernacular, form, it, is, allowed, under, the, iczn, code, because, of, its, subsequent, latinization, chordates, form, a, phylum, of, animals, that, are, defined, by, having, at, some, stage, in, their, lives, all, of, the, following, anatomical, features, there, are, soft, constraints, that, separate, chordates, from, other, biological, lineages, but, are, not, part, of, the, formal, definition, the, following, schema, is, from, the, 2015, edition, of, vertebrate, palaeontology, the, invertebrate, chordate, classes, are, from, fishes, of, the, world, while, it, is, structured, so, as, to, reflect, evolutionary, relationships, similar, to, a, cladogram, it, also, retains, the, traditional, ranks, used, in, linnaean, taxonomy, cephalochordates, one, of, the, three, subdivisions, of, chordates, are, small, vaguely, fish, shaped, animals, that, lack, brains, clearly, defined, heads, and, specialized, sense, organs, these, burrowing, filter, feeders, compose, the, earliest, branching, chordate, subphylum, most, tunicates, appear, as, adults, in, one, of, two, major, forms, known, as, sea, squirts, and, salps, both, of, these, are, soft, bodied, filter, feeders, that, lack, the, standard, features, of, chordates, which, are, only, retained, in, their, larvae, sea, squirts, are, sessile, and, consist, mainly, of, water, pumps, and, filter, feeding, apparatus, salps, float, in, mid, water, feeding, on, plankton, and, have, a, two, generation, cycle, in, which, one, generation, is, solitary, and, the, next, forms, chain, like, colonies, however, all, tunicate, larvae, have, the, standard, chordate, features, including, long, tadpole, like, tails, they, also, have, rudimentary, brains, light, sensors, and, tilt, sensors, the, third, main, group, of, tunicates, appendicularia, also, known, as, larvacea, retain, tadpole, like, shapes, and, active, swimming, all, their, lives, and, were, for, a, long, time, regarded, as, larvae, of, sea, squirts, or, salps, the, etymology, of, the, term, urochordata, balfour, 1881, is, from, the, ancient, greek, oura, tail, latin, chorda, cord, because, the, notochord, is, only, found, in, the, tail, the, term, tunicata, lamarck, 1816, is, recognised, as, having, precedence, and, is, now, more, commonly, used, craniates, all, have, distinct, skulls, they, include, the, hagfish, which, have, no, vertebrae, michael, j, benton, commented, that, craniates, are, characterized, by, their, heads, just, as, chordates, or, possibly, all, deuterostomes, are, by, their, tails, most, craniates, are, vertebrates, in, which, the, notochord, is, replaced, by, the, vertebral, column, it, consists, of, a, series, of, bony, or, cartilaginous, cylindrical, vertebrae, generally, with, neural, arches, that, protect, the, spinal, cord, and, with, projections, that, link, the, vertebrae, hagfishes, have, incomplete, braincases, and, no, vertebrae, and, are, therefore, not, regarded, as, vertebrates, but, they, are, members, of, the, craniates, the, group, within, which, vertebrates, are, thought, to, have, evolved, however, the, cladistic, exclusion, of, hagfish, from, the, vertebrates, is, controversial, as, they, may, instead, be, degenerate, vertebrates, who, have, secondarily, lost, their, vertebral, columns, the, position, of, lampreys, is, ambiguous, they, have, complete, braincases, and, rudimentary, vertebrae, and, therefore, may, be, regarded, as, vertebrates, and, true, fish, however, molecular, phylogenetics, which, uses, biochemical, features, to, classify, organisms, has, produced, both, results, that, group, them, with, vertebrates, and, others, that, group, them, with, hagfish, if, lampreys, are, more, closely, related, to, the, hagfish, than, the, other, vertebrates, this, would, suggest, that, they, form, a, clade, which, has, been, named, the, cyclostomata, there, is, still, much, ongoing, differential, dna, sequence, based, comparison, research, that, is, trying, to, separate, out, the, simplest, forms, of, chordates, as, some, lineages, of, the, 90, of, species, that, lack, a, backbone, or, notochord, might, have, lost, these, structures, over, time, this, complicates, the, classification, of, chordates, some, chordate, lineages, may, only, be, found, by, dna, analysis, when, there, is, no, physical, trace, of, any, chordate, like, structures, attempts, to, work, out, the, evolutionary, relationships, of, the, chordates, have, produced, several, hypotheses, the, current, consensus, is, that, chordates, are, monophyletic, meaning, that, the, chordata, include, all, and, only, the, descendants, of, a, single, common, ancestor, which, is, itself, a, chordate, and, that, craniates, nearest, relatives, are, tunicates, recent, identification, of, two, conserved, signature, indels, csis, in, the, proteins, cyclophilin, like, protein, and, mitochondrial, inner, membrane, protease, atp23, which, are, exclusively, shared, by, all, vertebrates, tunicates, and, cephalochordates, also, provide, strong, evidence, of, the, monophyly, of, chordata, all, of, the, earliest, chordate, fossils, have, been, found, in, the, early, cambrian, chengjiang, fauna, and, include, two, species, that, are, regarded, as, fish, which, implies, that, they, are, vertebrates, because, the, fossil, record, of, early, chordates, is, poor, only, molecular, phylogenetics, offers, a, reasonable, prospect, of, dating, their, emergence, however, the, use, of, molecular, phylogenetics, for, dating, evolutionary, transitions, is, controversial, it, has, also, proved, difficult, to, produce, a, detailed, classification, within, the, living, chordates, attempts, to, produce, evolutionary, family, trees, shows, that, many, of, the, traditional, classes, are, paraphyletic, hemichordates, echinoderms, cephalochordates, tunicates, craniates, vertebrates, while, this, has, been, well, known, since, the, 19th, century, an, insistence, on, only, monophyletic, taxa, has, resulted, in, vertebrate, classification, being, in, a, state, of, flux, the, majority, of, animals, more, complex, than, jellyfish, and, other, cnidarians, are, split, into, two, groups, the, protostomes, and, deuterostomes, the, latter, of, which, contains, chordates, it, seems, very, likely, the, 555, million, year, old, kimberella, was, a, member, of, the, protostomes, if, so, this, means, the, protostome, and, deuterostome, lineages, must, have, split, some, time, before, kimberella, appeared, at, least, 558, million, years, ago, and, hence, well, before, the, start, of, the, cambrian, 538, 8, million, years, ago, three, enigmatic, species, that, are, possible, very, early, tunicates, and, therefor, deuterostomes, were, also, found, from, the, ediacaran, period, ausia, fenestrata, from, the, nama, group, of, namibia, the, sac, like, yarnemia, ascidiformis, and, one, from, a, second, new, ausia, like, genus, from, the, onega, peninsula, of, northern, russia, burykhia, hunti, results, of, a, new, study, have, shown, possible, affinity, of, these, ediacaran, organisms, to, the, ascidians, ausia, and, burykhia, lived, in, shallow, coastal, waters, slightly, more, than, 555, to, 548, million, years, ago, and, are, believed, to, be, the, oldest, evidence, of, the, chordate, lineage, of, metazoans, the, russian, precambrian, fossil, yarnemia, is, identified, as, a, tunicate, only, tentatively, because, its, fossils, are, nowhere, near, as, well, preserved, as, those, of, ausia, and, burykhia, so, this, identification, has, been, questioned, fossils, of, one, major, deuterostome, group, the, echinoderms, whose, modern, members, include, starfish, sea, urchins, and, crinoids, are, quite, common, from, the, start, of, the, cambrian, 542, million, years, ago, the, mid, cambrian, fossil, rhabdotubus, johanssoni, has, been, interpreted, as, a, pterobranch, hemichordate, opinions, differ, about, whether, the, chengjiang, fauna, fossil, yunnanozoon, from, the, earlier, cambrian, was, a, hemichordate, or, chordate, another, fossil, haikouella, lanceolata, also, from, the, chengjiang, fauna, is, interpreted, as, a, chordate, and, possibly, a, craniate, as, it, shows, signs, of, a, heart, arteries, gill, filaments, a, tail, a, neural, chord, with, a, brain, at, the, front, end, and, possibly, eyes, although, it, also, had, short, tentacles, round, its, mouth, haikouichthys, and, myllokunmingia, also, from, the, chengjiang, fauna, are, regarded, as, fish, pikaia, discovered, much, earlier, 1911, but, from, the, mid, cambrian, burgess, shale, 505, ma, is, also, regarded, as, a, primitive, chordate, on, the, other, hand, fossils, of, early, chordates, are, very, rare, since, invertebrate, chordates, have, no, bones, or, teeth, and, only, one, has, been, reported, for, the, rest, of, the, cambrian, the, best, known, and, earliest, unequivocally, identified, tunicate, is, shankouclava, shankouense, from, the, lower, cambrian, maotianshan, shale, at, shankou, village, anning, near, kunming, south, china, the, evolutionary, relationships, between, the, chordate, groups, and, between, chordates, as, a, whole, and, their, closest, deuterostome, relatives, have, been, debated, since, 1890, studies, based, on, anatomical, embryological, and, paleontological, data, have, produced, different, family, trees, some, closely, linked, chordates, and, hemichordates, but, that, idea, is, now, rejected, combining, such, analyses, with, data, from, a, small, set, of, ribosome, rna, genes, eliminated, some, older, ideas, but, opened, up, the, possibility, that, tunicates, urochordates, are, basal, deuterostomes, surviving, members, of, the, group, from, which, echinoderms, hemichordates, and, chordates, evolved, some, researchers, believe, that, within, the, chordates, craniates, are, most, closely, related, to, cephalochordates, but, there, are, also, reasons, for, regarding, tunicates, urochordates, as, craniates, closest, relatives, since, early, chordates, have, left, a, poor, fossil, record, attempts, have, been, made, to, calculate, the, key, dates, in, their, evolution, by, molecular, phylogenetics, techniques, by, analyzing, biochemical, differences, mainly, in, rna, one, such, study, suggested, that, deuterostomes, arose, before, 900, million, years, ago, and, the, earliest, chordates, around, 896, million, years, ago, however, molecular, estimates, of, dates, often, disagree, with, each, other, and, with, the, fossil, record, and, their, assumption, that, the, molecular, clock, runs, at, a, known, constant, rate, has, been, challenged, traditionally, cephalochordata, and, craniata, were, grouped, into, the, proposed, clade, euchordata, which, would, have, been, the, sister, group, to, tunicata, urochordata, more, recently, cephalochordata, has, been, thought, of, as, a, sister, group, to, the, olfactores, which, includes, the, craniates, and, tunicates, the, matter, is, not, yet, settled, a, specific, relationship, between, vertebrates, and, tunicates, is, also, strongly, supported, by, two, csis, found, in, the, proteins, predicted, exosome, complex, rrp44, and, serine, palmitoyltransferase, that, are, exclusively, shared, by, species, from, these, two, subphyla, but, not, cephalochordates, indicating, vertebrates, are, more, closely, related, to, tunicates, than, cephalochordates, below, is, a, phylogenetic, tree, of, the, phylum, lines, of, the, cladogram, show, probable, evolutionary, relationships, between, both, extinct, taxa, which, are, denoted, with, a, dagger, and, extant, taxa, relatives, of, vertebrates, are, invertebrates, the, positions, relationships, of, the, lancelets, tunicates, and, craniates, vertebrates, are, based, on, the, following, studies, cephalochordata, lancelets, appendicularia, larvaceans, thaliacea, phlebobranchia, aplousobranchia, stolidobranchia, anaspidomorphi, cephalaspidomorphi, conodonta, myxini, hagfish, hyperoartia, lampreys, myllokunmingiida, pteraspidomorphi, thelodonti, placodermi, paraphyletic, acanthodii, paraphyletic, holocephali, selachimorpha, sharks, batoidea, rays, cladistia, chondrostei, holostei, teleostei, actinistia, coelacanths, dipnoi, lungfish, amphibia, sauropsida, synapsida, the, closest, relatives, of, the, chordates, are, believed, to, be, the, hemichordates, and, echinodermata, which, together, form, the, ambulacraria, the, chordata, and, ambulacraria, together, form, the, superphylum, deuterostomia, hemichordates, half, chordates, have, some, features, similar, to, those, of, chordates, branchial, openings, that, open, into, the, pharynx, and, look, rather, like, gill, slits, stomochords, similar, in, composition, to, notochords, but, running, in, a, circle, round, the, collar, which, is, ahead, of, the, mouth, and, a, dorsal, nerve, cord, but, also, a, smaller, ventral, nerve, cord, there, are, two, living, groups, of, hemichordates, the, solitary, enteropneusts, commonly, known, as, acorn, worms, have, long, proboscises, and, worm, like, bodies, with, up, to, 200, branchial, slits, are, up, to, 2, 5, metres, 8, 2, ft, long, and, burrow, though, seafloor, sediments, pterobranchs, are, colonial, animals, often, less, than, 1, millimetre, 0, 039, in, long, individually, whose, dwellings, are, interconnected, each, filter, feeds, by, means, of, a, pair, of, branched, tentacles, and, has, a, short, shield, shaped, proboscis, the, extinct, graptolites, colonial, animals, whose, fossils, look, like, tiny, hacksaw, blades, lived, in, tubes, similar, to, those, of, pterobranchs, echinoderms, differ, from, chordates, and, their, other, relatives, in, three, conspicuous, ways, they, possess, bilateral, symmetry, only, as, larvae, in, adulthood, they, have, radial, symmetry, meaning, that, their, body, pattern, is, shaped, like, a, wheel, they, have, tube, feet, and, their, bodies, are, supported, by, dermal, skeletons, made, of, calcite, a, material, not, used, by, chordates, their, hard, calcified, shells, keep, their, bodies, well, protected, from, the, environment, and, these, skeletons, enclose, their, bodies, but, are, also, covered, by, thin, skins, the, feet, are, powered, by, another, unique, feature, of, echinoderms, a, water, vascular, system, of, canals, that, also, functions, as, a, lung, and, surrounded, by, muscles, that, act, as, pumps, crinoids, are, typically, sessile, and, look, rather, like, flowers, hence, the, common, name, sea, lilies, and, use, their, feather, like, arms, to, filter, food, particles, out, of, the, water, most, live, anchored, to, rocks, but, a, few, species, can, move, very, slowly, other, echinoderms, are, mobile, and, take, a, variety, of, body, shapes, for, example, starfish, and, brittle, stars, sea, urchins, and, sea, cucumbers
