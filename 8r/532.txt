sharks, are, a, group, of, elasmobranch, fish, characterized, by, a, cartilaginous, skeleton, five, to, seven, gill, slits, on, the, sides, of, the, head, and, pectoral, fins, that, are, not, fused, to, the, head, modern, sharks, are, classified, within, the, clade, selachimorpha, or, selachii, and, are, the, sister, group, to, the, batoidea, rays, and, kin, some, sources, extend, the, term, shark, as, an, informal, category, including, extinct, members, of, chondrichthyes, cartilaginous, fish, with, a, shark, like, morphology, such, as, hybodonts, shark, like, chondrichthyans, such, as, cladoselache, and, doliodus, first, appeared, in, the, devonian, period, 419, 359, million, years, though, some, fossilized, chondrichthyan, like, scales, are, as, old, as, the, late, ordovician, 458, 444, million, years, ago, the, earliest, confirmed, modern, sharks, selachimorphs, are, known, from, the, early, jurassic, around, 200, million, years, ago, with, the, oldest, known, member, being, agaleus, though, records, of, true, sharks, may, extend, back, as, far, as, the, permian, sharks, range, in, size, from, the, small, dwarf, lanternshark, etmopterus, perryi, a, deep, sea, species, that, is, only, 17, centimetres, 6, 7, in, in, length, to, the, whale, shark, rhincodon, typus, the, largest, fish, in, the, world, which, reaches, approximately, 12, metres, 40, ft, in, length, they, are, found, in, all, seas, and, are, common, to, depths, up, to, 2, 000, metres, 6, 600, ft, they, generally, do, not, live, in, freshwater, although, there, are, a, few, known, exceptions, such, as, the, bull, shark, and, the, river, sharks, which, can, be, found, in, both, seawater, and, freshwater, and, the, ganges, shark, which, lives, only, in, freshwater, sharks, have, a, covering, of, dermal, denticles, that, protects, their, skin, from, damage, and, parasites, in, addition, to, improving, their, fluid, dynamics, they, have, numerous, sets, of, replaceable, teeth, several, species, are, apex, predators, which, are, organisms, that, are, at, the, top, of, their, food, chain, select, examples, include, the, bull, shark, tiger, shark, great, white, shark, mako, sharks, thresher, sharks, and, hammerhead, sharks, sharks, are, caught, by, humans, for, shark, meat, or, shark, fin, soup, many, shark, populations, are, threatened, by, human, activities, since, 1970, shark, populations, have, been, reduced, by, 71, mostly, from, overfishing, until, the, 16th, century, sharks, were, known, to, mariners, as, sea, dogs, this, is, still, evidential, in, several, species, termed, dogfish, or, the, porbeagle, the, etymology, of, the, word, shark, is, uncertain, the, most, likely, etymology, states, that, the, original, sense, of, the, word, was, that, of, predator, one, who, preys, on, others, from, the, dutch, schurk, meaning, villain, scoundrel, cf, card, shark, loan, shark, etc, which, was, later, applied, to, the, fish, due, to, its, predatory, behaviour, a, now, disproven, theory, is, that, it, derives, from, the, yucatec, maya, word, xook, pronounced, meaning, shark, evidence, for, this, etymology, came, from, the, oxford, english, dictionary, which, notes, that, shark, first, came, into, use, after, sir, john, hawkins, sailors, exhibited, one, in, london, in, 1569, and, posted, sharke, to, refer, to, the, large, sharks, of, the, caribbean, sea, however, the, middle, english, dictionary, records, an, isolated, occurrence, of, the, word, shark, referring, to, a, sea, fish, in, a, letter, written, by, thomas, beckington, in, 1442, which, rules, out, a, new, world, etymology, the, oldest, total, group, chondrichthyans, known, as, acanthodians, or, spiny, sharks, appeared, during, the, early, silurian, around, 439, million, years, ago, the, oldest, confirmed, members, of, elasmobranchii, sensu, lato, the, group, containing, all, cartilaginous, fish, more, closely, related, to, modern, sharks, and, rays, than, to, chimaeras, appeared, during, the, devonian, anachronistidae, the, oldest, probable, representatives, of, neoselachii, the, group, containing, modern, sharks, selachimorpha, and, rays, batoidea, to, the, exclusion, of, most, extinct, elasmobranch, groups, date, to, the, carboniferous, selachiimorpha, and, batoidea, are, suggested, by, some, to, have, diverged, during, the, triassic, fossils, of, the, earliest, true, sharks, may, have, appeared, during, the, permian, based, on, remains, of, synechodontiforms, found, in, the, early, permian, of, russia, but, if, remains, of, synechodontiformes, from, the, permian, and, triassic, are, true, sharks, they, only, had, low, diversity, modern, shark, orders, first, appeared, during, the, early, jurassic, and, during, the, jurassic, true, sharks, underwent, great, diversification, selachimorphs, largely, replaced, the, hybodonts, which, had, previously, been, a, dominant, group, of, shark, like, fish, during, the, triassic, and, early, jurassic, batoidea, heterodontiformes, orectolobiformes, carcharhiniformes, lamniformes, hexanchiformes, squatiniformes, pristiophoriformes, squaliformes, sharks, belong, to, the, clade, selachimorpha, in, the, subclass, elasmobranchii, in, the, class, chondrichthyes, the, elasmobranchii, also, include, rays, and, skates, the, chondrichthyes, also, include, chimaeras, it, was, thought, that, the, sharks, form, a, polyphyletic, group, some, sharks, are, more, closely, related, to, rays, than, they, are, to, some, other, sharks, but, current, molecular, studies, support, monophyly, of, both, groups, of, sharks, and, batoids, the, clade, selachimorpha, is, divided, into, the, superorders, galea, or, galeomorphii, and, squalea, or, squalomorphii, the, galeans, are, the, heterodontiformes, orectolobiformes, lamniformes, and, carcharhiniformes, lamnoids, and, carcharhinoids, are, usually, placed, in, one, clade, but, recent, studies, show, that, lamnoids, and, orectoloboids, are, a, clade, some, scientists, now, think, that, heterodontoids, may, be, squalean, the, squaleans, are, divided, into, hexanchiformes, and, squalomorpha, the, former, includes, cow, shark, and, frilled, shark, though, some, authors, propose, that, both, families, be, moved, to, separate, orders, the, squalomorpha, contains, the, squaliformes, and, the, hypnosqualea, the, hypnosqualea, may, be, invalid, it, includes, the, squatiniformes, and, the, pristorajea, which, may, also, be, invalid, but, includes, the, pristiophoriformes, and, the, batoidea, there, are, more, than, 500, species, of, sharks, split, across, thirteen, orders, including, several, orders, of, sharks, that, have, gone, extinct, shark, teeth, are, embedded, in, the, gums, rather, than, directly, affixed, to, the, jaw, and, are, constantly, replaced, throughout, life, multiple, rows, of, replacement, teeth, grow, in, a, groove, on, the, inside, of, the, jaw, and, steadily, move, forward, in, comparison, to, a, conveyor, belt, some, sharks, lose, 30, 000, or, more, teeth, in, their, lifetime, the, rate, of, tooth, replacement, varies, from, once, every, 8, to, 10, days, to, several, months, in, most, species, teeth, are, replaced, one, at, a, time, as, opposed, to, the, simultaneous, replacement, of, an, entire, row, which, is, observed, in, the, cookiecutter, shark, tooth, shape, depends, on, the, shark, s, diet, those, that, feed, on, mollusks, and, crustaceans, have, dense, and, flattened, teeth, used, for, crushing, those, that, feed, on, fish, have, needle, like, teeth, for, gripping, and, those, that, feed, on, larger, prey, such, as, mammals, have, pointed, lower, teeth, for, gripping, and, triangular, upper, teeth, with, serrated, edges, for, cutting, the, teeth, of, plankton, feeders, such, as, the, basking, shark, are, small, and, non, functional, shark, skeletons, are, very, different, from, those, of, bony, fish, and, terrestrial, vertebrates, sharks, and, other, cartilaginous, fish, skates, and, rays, have, skeletons, made, of, cartilage, and, connective, tissue, cartilage, is, flexible, and, durable, yet, is, about, half, the, normal, density, of, bone, this, reduces, the, skeleton, s, weight, saving, energy, because, sharks, do, not, have, rib, cages, they, can, easily, be, crushed, under, their, own, weight, on, land, the, jaws, of, sharks, like, those, of, rays, and, skates, are, not, attached, to, the, cranium, the, jaw, s, surface, in, comparison, to, the, shark, s, vertebrae, and, gill, arches, needs, extra, support, due, to, its, heavy, exposure, to, physical, stress, and, its, need, for, strength, it, has, a, layer, of, tiny, hexagonal, plates, called, tesserae, which, are, crystal, blocks, of, calcium, salts, arranged, as, a, mosaic, this, gives, these, areas, much, of, the, same, strength, found, in, the, bony, tissue, found, in, other, animals, generally, sharks, have, only, one, layer, of, tesserae, but, the, jaws, of, large, specimens, such, as, the, bull, shark, tiger, shark, and, the, great, white, shark, have, two, to, three, layers, or, more, depending, on, body, size, the, jaws, of, a, large, great, white, shark, may, have, up, to, five, layers, in, the, rostrum, snout, the, cartilage, can, be, spongy, and, flexible, to, absorb, the, power, of, impacts, fin, skeletons, are, elongated, and, supported, with, soft, and, unsegmented, rays, named, ceratotrichia, filaments, of, elastic, protein, resembling, the, horny, keratin, in, hair, and, feathers, most, sharks, have, eight, fins, sharks, can, only, drift, away, from, objects, directly, in, front, of, them, because, their, fins, do, not, allow, them, to, move, in, the, tail, first, direction, unlike, bony, fish, sharks, have, a, complex, dermal, corset, made, of, flexible, collagenous, fibers, and, arranged, as, a, helical, network, surrounding, their, body, this, works, as, an, outer, skeleton, providing, attachment, for, their, swimming, muscles, and, thus, saving, energy, their, dermal, teeth, give, them, hydrodynamic, advantages, as, they, reduce, turbulence, when, swimming, some, species, of, shark, have, pigmented, denticles, that, form, complex, patterns, like, spots, e, g, zebra, shark, and, stripes, e, g, tiger, shark, these, markings, are, important, for, camouflage, and, help, sharks, blend, in, with, their, environment, as, well, as, making, them, difficult, for, prey, to, detect, for, some, species, dermal, patterning, returns, to, healed, denticles, even, after, they, have, been, removed, by, injury, tails, provide, thrust, making, speed, and, acceleration, dependent, on, tail, shape, caudal, fin, shapes, vary, considerably, between, shark, species, due, to, their, evolution, in, separate, environments, sharks, possess, a, heterocercal, caudal, fin, in, which, the, dorsal, portion, is, usually, noticeably, larger, than, the, ventral, portion, this, is, because, the, shark, s, vertebral, column, extends, into, that, dorsal, portion, providing, a, greater, surface, area, for, muscle, attachment, this, allows, more, efficient, locomotion, among, these, negatively, buoyant, cartilaginous, fish, by, contrast, most, bony, fish, possess, a, homocercal, caudal, fin, tiger, sharks, have, a, large, upper, lobe, which, allows, for, slow, cruising, and, sudden, bursts, of, speed, the, tiger, shark, must, be, able, to, twist, and, turn, in, the, water, easily, when, hunting, to, support, its, varied, diet, whereas, the, porbeagle, shark, which, hunts, schooling, fish, such, as, mackerel, and, herring, has, a, large, lower, lobe, to, help, it, keep, pace, with, its, fast, swimming, prey, other, tail, adaptations, help, sharks, catch, prey, more, directly, such, as, the, thresher, shark, s, usage, of, its, powerful, elongated, upper, lobe, to, stun, fish, and, squid, unlike, bony, fish, sharks, do, not, have, gas, filled, swim, bladders, for, buoyancy, instead, sharks, rely, on, a, large, liver, filled, with, oil, that, contains, squalene, and, their, cartilage, which, is, about, half, the, normal, density, of, bone, their, liver, constitutes, up, to, 30, of, their, total, body, mass, the, liver, s, effectiveness, is, limited, so, sharks, employ, dynamic, lift, to, maintain, depth, while, swimming, sand, tiger, sharks, store, air, in, their, stomachs, using, it, as, a, form, of, swim, bladder, bottom, dwelling, sharks, like, the, nurse, shark, have, negative, buoyancy, allowing, them, to, rest, on, the, ocean, floor, some, sharks, if, inverted, or, stroked, on, the, nose, enter, a, natural, state, of, tonic, immobility, researchers, use, this, condition, to, handle, sharks, safely, like, other, fish, sharks, extract, oxygen, from, seawater, as, it, passes, over, their, gills, unlike, other, fish, shark, gill, slits, are, not, covered, but, lie, in, a, row, behind, the, head, a, modified, slit, called, a, spiracle, lies, just, behind, the, eye, which, assists, the, shark, with, taking, in, water, during, respiration, and, plays, a, major, role, in, bottom, dwelling, sharks, spiracles, are, reduced, or, missing, in, active, pelagic, sharks, while, the, shark, is, moving, water, passes, through, the, mouth, and, over, the, gills, in, a, process, known, as, ram, ventilation, while, at, rest, most, sharks, pump, water, over, their, gills, to, ensure, a, constant, supply, of, oxygenated, water, a, small, number, of, species, have, lost, the, ability, to, pump, water, through, their, gills, and, must, swim, without, rest, these, species, are, obligate, ram, ventilators, and, would, presumably, asphyxiate, if, unable, to, move, obligate, ram, ventilation, is, also, true, of, some, pelagic, bony, fish, species, the, respiratory, and, circulatory, process, begins, when, deoxygenated, venous, blood, travels, to, the, shark, s, two, chambered, heart, here, the, shark, pumps, blood, to, its, gills, via, the, ventral, aorta, where, it, branches, into, afferent, branchial, arteries, gas, exchange, takes, place, in, the, gills, and, the, reoxygenated, blood, flows, into, the, efferent, branchial, arteries, which, come, together, to, form, the, dorsal, aorta, the, blood, flows, from, the, dorsal, aorta, throughout, the, body, the, deoxygenated, blood, from, the, body, then, flows, through, the, posterior, cardinal, veins, and, enters, the, posterior, cardinal, sinuses, from, there, venous, blood, re, enters, the, heart, ventricle, and, the, cycle, repeats, most, sharks, are, cold, blooded, or, more, precisely, poikilothermic, meaning, that, their, internal, body, temperature, matches, that, of, their, ambient, environment, members, of, the, family, lamnidae, such, as, the, shortfin, mako, shark, and, the, great, white, shark, are, homeothermic, and, maintain, a, higher, body, temperature, than, the, surrounding, water, in, these, sharks, a, strip, of, aerobic, red, muscle, located, near, the, center, of, the, body, generates, the, heat, which, the, body, retains, via, a, countercurrent, exchange, mechanism, by, a, system, of, blood, vessels, called, the, rete, mirabile, miraculous, net, the, common, thresher, and, bigeye, thresher, sharks, have, a, similar, mechanism, for, maintaining, an, elevated, body, temperature, larger, species, like, the, whale, shark, are, able, to, conserve, their, body, heat, through, sheer, size, when, they, dive, to, colder, depths, and, the, scalloped, hammerhead, close, its, mouth, and, gills, when, they, dives, to, depths, of, around, 800, metres, holding, its, breath, till, it, reach, warmer, waters, again, in, contrast, to, bony, fish, with, the, exception, of, the, coelacanth, the, blood, and, other, tissue, of, sharks, and, chondrichthyes, is, generally, isotonic, to, their, marine, environments, because, of, the, high, concentration, of, urea, up, to, 2, 5, and, trimethylamine, n, oxide, tmao, allowing, them, to, be, in, osmotic, balance, with, the, seawater, this, adaptation, prevents, most, sharks, from, surviving, in, freshwater, and, they, are, therefore, confined, to, marine, environments, a, few, exceptions, exist, such, as, the, bull, shark, which, has, developed, a, way, to, change, its, kidney, function, to, excrete, large, amounts, of, urea, when, a, shark, dies, the, urea, is, broken, down, to, ammonia, by, bacteria, causing, the, dead, body, to, gradually, smell, strongly, of, ammonia, research, in, 1930, by, homer, w, smith, showed, that, sharks, urine, does, not, contain, sufficient, sodium, to, avoid, hypernatremia, and, it, was, postulated, that, there, must, be, an, additional, mechanism, for, salt, secretion, in, 1960, it, was, discovered, at, the, mount, desert, island, biological, laboratory, in, salsbury, cove, maine, that, sharks, have, a, type, of, salt, gland, located, at, the, end, of, the, intestine, known, as, the, rectal, gland, whose, function, is, the, secretion, of, chlorides, digestion, can, take, a, long, time, the, food, moves, from, the, mouth, to, a, j, shaped, stomach, where, it, is, stored, and, initial, digestion, occurs, unwanted, items, may, never, get, past, the, stomach, and, instead, the, shark, either, vomits, or, turns, its, stomachs, inside, out, and, ejects, unwanted, items, from, its, mouth, one, of, the, biggest, differences, between, the, digestive, systems, of, sharks, and, mammals, is, that, sharks, have, much, shorter, intestines, this, short, length, is, achieved, by, the, spiral, valve, with, multiple, turns, within, a, single, short, section, instead, of, a, long, tube, like, intestine, the, valve, provides, a, long, surface, area, requiring, food, to, circulate, inside, the, short, gut, until, fully, digested, when, remaining, waste, products, pass, into, the, cloaca, a, few, sharks, appear, fluorescent, under, blue, light, such, as, the, swell, shark, and, the, chain, catshark, where, the, fluorophore, derives, from, a, metabolite, of, kynurenic, acid, sharks, have, keen, olfactory, senses, located, in, the, short, duct, which, is, not, fused, unlike, bony, fish, between, the, anterior, and, posterior, nasal, openings, with, some, species, able, to, detect, as, little, as, one, part, per, million, of, blood, in, seawater, the, size, of, the, olfactory, bulb, varies, across, different, shark, species, with, size, dependent, on, how, much, a, given, species, relies, on, smell, or, vision, to, find, their, prey, in, environments, with, low, visibility, shark, species, generally, have, larger, olfactory, bulbs, in, reefs, where, visibility, is, high, species, of, sharks, from, the, family, carcharhinidae, have, smaller, olfactory, bulbs, sharks, found, in, deeper, waters, also, have, larger, olfactory, bulbs, sharks, have, the, ability, to, determine, the, direction, of, a, given, scent, based, on, the, timing, of, scent, detection, in, each, nostril, this, is, similar, to, the, method, mammals, use, to, determine, direction, of, sound, they, are, more, attracted, to, the, chemicals, found, in, the, intestines, of, many, species, and, as, a, result, often, linger, near, or, in, sewage, outfalls, some, species, such, as, nurse, sharks, have, external, barbels, that, greatly, increase, their, ability, to, sense, prey, shark, eyes, are, similar, to, the, eyes, of, other, vertebrates, including, similar, lenses, corneas, and, retinas, though, their, eyesight, is, well, adapted, to, the, marine, environment, with, the, help, of, a, tissue, called, tapetum, lucidum, this, tissue, is, behind, the, retina, and, reflects, light, back, to, it, thereby, increasing, visibility, in, the, dark, waters, the, effectiveness, of, the, tissue, varies, with, some, sharks, having, stronger, nocturnal, adaptations, many, sharks, can, contract, and, dilate, their, pupils, like, humans, something, no, teleost, fish, can, do, sharks, have, eyelids, but, they, do, not, blink, because, the, surrounding, water, cleans, their, eyes, to, protect, their, eyes, some, species, have, nictitating, membranes, this, membrane, covers, the, eyes, while, hunting, and, when, the, shark, is, being, attacked, however, some, species, including, the, great, white, shark, carcharodon, carcharias, do, not, have, this, membrane, but, instead, roll, their, eyes, backwards, to, protect, them, when, striking, prey, the, importance, of, sight, in, shark, hunting, behavior, is, debated, some, believe, that, electro, and, chemoreception, are, more, significant, while, others, point, to, the, nictating, membrane, as, evidence, that, sight, is, important, since, presumably, the, shark, would, not, protect, its, eyes, were, they, unimportant, the, use, of, sight, probably, varies, with, species, and, water, conditions, the, shark, s, field, of, vision, can, swap, between, monocular, and, stereoscopic, at, any, time, a, micro, spectrophotometry, study, of, 17, species, of, sharks, found, 10, had, only, rod, photoreceptors, and, no, cone, cells, in, their, retinas, giving, them, good, night, vision, while, making, them, colorblind, the, remaining, seven, species, had, in, addition, to, rods, a, single, type, of, cone, photoreceptor, sensitive, to, green, and, seeing, only, in, shades, of, grey, and, green, are, believed, to, be, effectively, colorblind, the, study, indicates, that, an, object, s, contrast, against, the, background, rather, than, colour, may, be, more, important, for, object, detection, although, it, is, hard, to, test, the, hearing, of, sharks, they, may, have, a, sharp, sense, of, hearing, and, can, possibly, hear, prey, from, many, miles, away, the, hearing, sensitivity, for, most, shark, species, lies, between, 20, and, 1000, hz, a, small, opening, on, each, side, of, their, heads, not, the, spiracle, leads, directly, into, the, inner, ear, through, a, thin, channel, the, lateral, line, shows, a, similar, arrangement, and, is, open, to, the, environment, via, a, series, of, openings, called, lateral, line, pores, this, is, a, reminder, of, the, common, origin, of, these, two, vibration, and, sound, detecting, organs, that, are, grouped, together, as, the, acoustico, lateralis, system, in, bony, fish, and, tetrapods, the, external, opening, into, the, inner, ear, has, been, lost, the, ampullae, of, lorenzini, are, the, electroreceptor, organs, they, number, in, the, hundreds, to, thousands, sharks, use, the, ampullae, of, lorenzini, to, detect, the, electromagnetic, fields, that, all, living, things, produce, this, helps, sharks, particularly, the, hammerhead, shark, find, prey, the, shark, has, the, greatest, electrical, sensitivity, of, any, animal, sharks, find, prey, hidden, in, sand, by, detecting, the, electric, fields, they, produce, ocean, currents, moving, in, the, magnetic, field, of, the, earth, also, generate, electric, fields, that, sharks, can, use, for, orientation, and, possibly, navigation, this, system, is, found, in, most, fish, including, sharks, it, is, a, tactile, sensory, system, which, allows, the, organism, to, detect, water, speed, and, pressure, changes, near, by, the, main, component, of, the, system, is, the, neuromast, a, cell, similar, to, hair, cells, present, in, the, vertebrate, ear, that, interact, with, the, surrounding, aquatic, environment, this, helps, sharks, distinguish, between, the, currents, around, them, obstacles, off, on, their, periphery, and, struggling, prey, out, of, visual, view, the, shark, can, sense, frequencies, in, the, range, of, 25, to, 50, hz, shark, lifespans, vary, by, species, most, live, 20, to, 30, years, the, spiny, dogfish, has, one, of, the, longest, lifespans, at, more, than, 100, years, whale, sharks, rhincodon, typus, may, also, live, over, 100, years, earlier, estimates, suggested, the, greenland, shark, somniosus, microcephalus, could, reach, about, 200, years, but, a, recent, study, found, that, a, 5, 02, metre, long, 16, 5, ft, specimen, was, 392, 120, years, old, i, e, at, least, 272, years, old, making, it, the, longest, lived, vertebrate, known, unlike, most, bony, fish, sharks, are, k, selected, reproducers, meaning, that, they, produce, a, small, number, of, well, developed, young, as, opposed, to, a, large, number, of, poorly, developed, young, fecundity, in, sharks, ranges, from, 2, to, over, 100, young, per, reproductive, cycle, sharks, mature, slowly, relative, to, many, other, fish, for, example, lemon, sharks, reach, sexual, maturity, at, around, age, 13, 15, sharks, practice, internal, fertilization, the, posterior, part, of, a, male, shark, s, pelvic, fins, are, modified, into, a, pair, of, intromittent, organs, called, claspers, analogous, to, a, mammalian, penis, of, which, one, is, used, to, deliver, sperm, into, the, female, mating, has, rarely, been, observed, in, sharks, the, smaller, catsharks, often, mate, with, the, male, curling, around, the, female, in, less, flexible, species, the, two, sharks, swim, parallel, to, each, other, while, the, male, inserts, a, clasper, into, the, female, s, oviduct, females, in, many, of, the, larger, species, have, bite, marks, that, appear, to, be, a, result, of, a, male, grasping, them, to, maintain, position, during, mating, the, bite, marks, may, also, come, from, courtship, behavior, the, male, may, bite, the, female, to, show, his, interest, in, some, species, females, have, evolved, thicker, skin, to, withstand, these, bites, there, have, been, a, number, of, documented, cases, in, which, a, female, shark, who, has, not, been, in, contact, with, a, male, has, conceived, a, pup, on, her, own, through, parthenogenesis, the, details, of, this, process, are, not, well, understood, but, genetic, fingerprinting, showed, that, the, pups, had, no, paternal, genetic, contribution, ruling, out, sperm, storage, the, extent, of, this, behavior, in, the, wild, is, unknown, mammals, are, now, the, only, major, vertebrate, group, in, which, asexual, reproduction, has, not, been, observed, scientists, say, that, asexual, reproduction, in, the, wild, is, rare, and, probably, a, last, ditch, effort, to, reproduce, when, a, mate, is, not, present, asexual, reproduction, diminishes, genetic, diversity, which, helps, build, defenses, against, threats, to, the, species, species, that, rely, solely, on, it, risk, extinction, asexual, reproduction, may, have, contributed, to, the, blue, shark, s, decline, off, the, irish, coast, sharks, display, three, ways, to, bear, their, young, varying, by, species, oviparity, viviparity, and, ovoviviparity, most, sharks, are, ovoviviparous, meaning, that, the, eggs, hatch, in, the, oviduct, within, the, mother, s, body, and, that, the, egg, s, yolk, and, fluids, secreted, by, glands, in, the, walls, of, the, oviduct, nourishes, the, embryos, the, young, continue, to, be, nourished, by, the, remnants, of, the, yolk, and, the, oviduct, s, fluids, as, in, viviparity, the, young, are, born, alive, and, fully, functional, lamniforme, sharks, practice, oophagy, where, the, first, embryos, to, hatch, eat, the, remaining, eggs, taking, this, a, step, further, sand, tiger, shark, pups, cannibalistically, consume, neighboring, embryos, the, survival, strategy, for, ovoviviparous, species, is, to, brood, the, young, to, a, comparatively, large, size, before, birth, the, whale, shark, is, now, classified, as, ovoviviparous, rather, than, oviparous, because, extrauterine, eggs, are, now, thought, to, have, been, aborted, most, ovoviviparous, sharks, give, birth, in, sheltered, areas, including, bays, river, mouths, and, shallow, reefs, they, choose, such, areas, for, protection, from, predators, mainly, other, sharks, and, the, abundance, of, food, dogfish, have, the, longest, known, gestation, period, of, any, shark, at, 18, to, 24, months, basking, sharks, and, frilled, sharks, appear, to, have, even, longer, gestation, periods, but, accurate, data, are, lacking, some, species, are, oviparous, laying, their, fertilized, eggs, in, the, water, in, most, oviparous, shark, species, an, egg, case, with, the, consistency, of, leather, protects, the, developing, embryo, s, these, cases, may, be, corkscrewed, into, crevices, for, protection, the, egg, case, is, commonly, called, a, mermaid, s, purse, oviparous, sharks, include, the, horn, shark, catshark, port, jackson, shark, and, swellshark, viviparity, is, the, gestation, of, young, without, the, use, of, a, traditional, egg, and, results, in, live, birth, viviparity, in, sharks, can, be, placental, or, aplacental, young, are, born, fully, formed, and, self, sufficient, hammerheads, the, requiem, sharks, such, as, the, bull, and, blue, sharks, and, smoothhounds, are, viviparous, the, classic, view, describes, a, solitary, hunter, ranging, the, oceans, in, search, of, food, however, this, applies, to, only, a, few, species, most, live, far, more, social, sedentary, benthic, lives, and, appear, likely, to, have, their, own, distinct, personalities, even, solitary, sharks, meet, for, breeding, or, at, rich, hunting, grounds, which, may, lead, them, to, cover, thousands, of, miles, in, a, year, shark, migration, patterns, may, be, even, more, complex, than, in, birds, with, many, sharks, covering, entire, ocean, basins, sharks, can, be, highly, social, remaining, in, large, schools, sometimes, more, than, 100, scalloped, hammerheads, congregate, around, seamounts, and, islands, e, g, in, the, gulf, of, california, cross, species, social, hierarchies, exist, for, example, oceanic, whitetip, sharks, dominate, silky, sharks, of, comparable, size, during, feeding, when, approached, too, closely, some, sharks, perform, a, threat, display, this, usually, consists, of, exaggerated, swimming, movements, and, can, vary, in, intensity, according, to, the, threat, level, in, general, sharks, swim, cruise, at, an, average, speed, of, 8, kilometres, per, hour, 5, 0, mph, but, when, feeding, or, attacking, the, average, shark, can, reach, speeds, upwards, of, 19, kilometres, per, hour, 12, mph, the, shortfin, mako, shark, the, fastest, shark, and, one, of, the, fastest, fish, can, burst, at, speeds, up, to, 50, kilometres, per, hour, 31, mph, the, great, white, shark, is, also, capable, of, speed, bursts, these, exceptions, may, be, due, to, the, warm, blooded, or, homeothermic, nature, of, these, sharks, physiology, sharks, can, travel, 70, to, 80, km, in, a, day, sharks, possess, brain, to, body, mass, ratios, that, are, similar, to, mammals, and, birds, and, have, exhibited, apparent, curiosity, and, behavior, resembling, play, in, the, wild, there, is, evidence, that, juvenile, lemon, sharks, can, use, observational, learning, in, their, investigation, of, novel, objects, in, their, environment, all, sharks, need, to, keep, water, flowing, over, their, gills, in, order, for, them, to, breathe, however, not, all, species, need, to, be, moving, to, do, this, those, that, are, able, to, breathe, while, not, swimming, do, so, by, using, their, spiracles, to, force, water, over, their, gills, thereby, allowing, them, to, extract, oxygen, from, the, water, it, has, been, recorded, that, their, eyes, remain, open, while, in, this, state, and, actively, follow, the, movements, of, divers, swimming, around, them, and, as, such, they, are, not, truly, asleep, species, that, do, need, to, swim, continuously, to, breathe, go, through, a, process, known, as, sleep, swimming, in, which, the, shark, is, essentially, unconscious, it, is, known, from, experiments, conducted, on, the, spiny, dogfish, that, its, spinal, cord, rather, than, its, brain, coordinates, swimming, so, spiny, dogfish, can, continue, to, swim, while, sleeping, and, this, also, may, be, the, case, in, larger, shark, species, in, 2016, a, great, white, shark, was, captured, on, video, for, the, first, time, in, a, state, researchers, believed, was, sleep, swimming, most, sharks, are, carnivorous, basking, sharks, whale, sharks, and, megamouth, sharks, have, independently, evolved, different, strategies, for, filter, feeding, plankton, basking, sharks, practice, ram, feeding, whale, sharks, use, suction, to, take, in, plankton, and, small, fishes, and, megamouth, sharks, make, suction, feeding, more, efficient, by, using, the, luminescent, tissue, inside, of, their, mouths, to, attract, prey, in, the, deep, ocean, this, type, of, feeding, requires, gill, rakers, long, slender, filaments, that, form, a, very, efficient, sieve, analogous, to, the, baleen, plates, of, the, great, whales, the, shark, traps, the, plankton, in, these, filaments, and, swallows, from, time, to, time, in, huge, mouthfuls, teeth, in, these, species, are, comparatively, small, because, they, are, not, needed, for, feeding, other, highly, specialized, feeders, include, cookiecutter, sharks, which, feed, on, flesh, sliced, out, of, other, larger, fish, and, marine, mammals, cookiecutter, teeth, are, enormous, compared, to, the, animal, s, size, the, lower, teeth, are, particularly, sharp, although, they, have, never, been, observed, feeding, they, are, believed, to, latch, onto, their, prey, and, use, their, thick, lips, to, make, a, seal, twisting, their, bodies, to, rip, off, flesh, some, seabed, dwelling, species, are, highly, effective, ambush, predators, angel, sharks, and, wobbegongs, use, camouflage, to, lie, in, wait, and, suck, prey, into, their, mouths, many, benthic, sharks, feed, solely, on, crustaceans, which, they, crush, with, their, flat, molariform, teeth, other, sharks, feed, on, squid, or, fish, which, they, swallow, whole, the, viper, dogfish, has, teeth, it, can, point, outwards, to, strike, and, capture, prey, that, it, then, swallows, intact, the, great, white, and, other, large, predators, either, swallow, small, prey, whole, or, take, huge, bites, out, of, large, animals, thresher, sharks, use, their, long, tails, to, stun, shoaling, fishes, and, sawsharks, either, stir, prey, from, the, seabed, or, slash, at, swimming, prey, with, their, tooth, studded, rostra, the, bonnethead, shark, is, the, only, known, omnivorous, species, its, main, prey, is, crustaceans, and, mollusks, but, it, also, eats, a, large, amount, of, seagrass, and, is, able, to, digest, and, extract, nutrients, from, about, 50, of, the, seagrass, it, consume, many, sharks, including, the, whitetip, reef, shark, are, cooperative, feeders, and, hunt, in, packs, to, herd, and, capture, elusive, prey, these, social, sharks, are, often, migratory, traveling, huge, distances, around, ocean, basins, in, large, schools, these, migrations, may, be, partly, necessary, to, find, new, food, sources, sharks, are, found, in, all, seas, they, generally, do, not, live, in, fresh, water, with, a, few, exceptions, such, as, the, bull, shark, and, the, river, shark, which, can, swim, both, in, seawater, and, freshwater, sharks, are, common, down, to, depths, of, 2, 000, metres, 7, 000, ft, and, some, live, even, deeper, but, they, are, almost, entirely, absent, below, 3, 000, metres, 10, 000, ft, the, deepest, confirmed, report, of, a, shark, is, a, portuguese, dogfish, at, 3, 700, metres, 12, 100, ft, in, 2006, the, international, shark, attack, file, isaf, undertook, an, investigation, into, 96, alleged, shark, attacks, confirming, 62, of, them, as, unprovoked, attacks, and, 16, as, provoked, attacks, the, average, number, of, fatalities, worldwide, per, year, between, 2001, and, 2006, from, unprovoked, shark, attacks, is, 4, 3, contrary, to, popular, belief, only, a, few, sharks, are, dangerous, to, humans, out, of, more, than, 470, species, only, four, have, been, involved, in, a, significant, number, of, fatal, unprovoked, attacks, on, humans, the, great, white, oceanic, whitetip, tiger, and, bull, sharks, these, sharks, are, large, powerful, predators, and, may, sometimes, attack, and, kill, people, despite, being, responsible, for, attacks, on, humans, they, have, all, been, filmed, without, using, a, protective, cage, the, perception, of, sharks, as, dangerous, animals, has, been, popularized, by, publicity, given, to, a, few, isolated, unprovoked, attacks, such, as, the, jersey, shore, shark, attacks, of, 1916, and, through, popular, fictional, works, about, shark, attacks, such, as, the, jaws, film, series, jaws, author, peter, benchley, as, well, as, jaws, director, steven, spielberg, later, attempted, to, dispel, the, image, of, sharks, as, man, eating, monsters, to, help, avoid, an, unprovoked, attack, humans, should, not, wear, jewelry, or, metal, that, is, shiny, and, refrain, from, splashing, around, too, much, in, general, sharks, show, little, pattern, of, attacking, humans, specifically, part, of, the, reason, could, be, that, sharks, prefer, the, blood, of, fish, and, other, common, preys, research, indicates, that, when, humans, do, become, the, object, of, a, shark, attack, it, is, possible, that, the, shark, has, mistaken, the, human, for, species, that, are, its, normal, prey, such, as, seals, this, was, further, proven, in, a, recent, study, conducted, by, researchers, at, the, california, state, university, s, shark, lab, according, to, footage, caught, by, the, lab, s, drones, juveniles, swam, right, up, to, humans, in, the, water, without, any, bites, incidents, the, lab, stated, that, the, results, showed, that, humans, and, sharks, can, co, exist, in, the, water, until, recently, only, a, few, benthic, species, of, shark, such, as, hornsharks, leopard, sharks, and, catsharks, had, survived, in, aquarium, conditions, for, a, year, or, more, this, gave, rise, to, the, belief, that, sharks, as, well, as, being, difficult, to, capture, and, transport, were, difficult, to, care, for, more, knowledge, has, led, to, more, species, including, the, large, pelagic, sharks, living, far, longer, in, captivity, along, with, safer, transportation, techniques, that, have, enabled, long, distance, transportation, the, great, white, shark, had, never, been, successfully, held, in, captivity, for, long, periods, of, time, until, september, 2004, when, the, monterey, bay, aquarium, successfully, kept, a, young, female, for, 198, days, before, releasing, her, most, species, are, not, suitable, for, home, aquaria, and, not, every, species, sold, by, pet, stores, are, appropriate, some, species, can, flourish, in, home, saltwater, aquaria, uninformed, or, unscrupulous, dealers, sometimes, sell, juvenile, sharks, like, the, nurse, shark, which, upon, reaching, adulthood, is, far, too, large, for, typical, home, aquaria, public, aquaria, generally, do, not, accept, donated, specimens, that, have, outgrown, their, housing, some, owners, have, been, tempted, to, release, them, species, appropriate, to, home, aquaria, represent, considerable, spatial, and, financial, investments, as, they, generally, approach, adult, lengths, of, 3, feet, 90, cm, and, can, live, up, to, 25, years, sharks, figure, prominently, in, hawaiian, mythology, stories, tell, of, men, with, shark, jaws, on, their, back, who, could, change, between, shark, and, human, form, a, common, theme, was, that, a, shark, man, would, warn, beach, goers, of, sharks, in, the, waters, the, beach, goers, would, laugh, and, ignore, the, warnings, and, get, eaten, by, the, shark, man, who, warned, them, hawaiian, mythology, also, includes, many, shark, gods, among, a, fishing, people, the, most, popular, of, all, aumakua, or, deified, ancestor, guardians, are, shark, aumakua, kamaku, describes, in, detail, how, to, offer, a, corpse, to, become, a, shark, the, body, transforms, gradually, until, the, kahuna, can, point, the, awe, struck, family, to, the, markings, on, the, shark, s, body, that, correspond, to, the, clothing, in, which, the, beloved, s, body, had, been, wrapped, such, a, shark, aumakua, becomes, the, family, pet, receiving, food, and, driving, fish, into, the, family, net, and, warding, off, danger, like, all, aumakua, it, had, evil, uses, such, as, helping, kill, enemies, the, ruling, chiefs, typically, forbade, such, sorcery, many, native, hawaiian, families, claim, such, an, aumakua, who, is, known, by, name, to, the, whole, community, kamohoali, i, is, the, best, known, and, revered, of, the, shark, gods, he, was, the, older, and, favored, brother, of, pele, and, helped, and, journeyed, with, her, to, hawaii, he, was, able, to, assume, all, human, and, fish, forms, a, summit, cliff, on, the, crater, of, kilauea, is, one, of, his, most, sacred, spots, at, one, point, he, had, a, heiau, temple, or, shrine, dedicated, to, him, on, every, piece, of, land, that, jutted, into, the, ocean, on, the, island, of, molokai, kamohoali, i, was, an, ancestral, god, not, a, human, who, became, a, shark, and, banned, the, eating, of, humans, after, eating, one, herself, in, fijian, mythology, dakuwaqa, was, a, shark, god, who, was, the, eater, of, lost, souls, on, the, island, of, tutuila, in, american, samoa, a, u, s, territory, there, is, a, location, called, turtle, and, shark, laumei, ma, malie, which, is, important, in, samoan, culture, the, location, is, the, site, of, a, legend, called, o, le, tala, i, le, laumei, ma, le, malie, in, which, two, humans, are, said, to, have, transformed, into, a, turtle, and, a, shark, according, to, the, u, s, national, park, service, villagers, from, nearby, vaitogi, continue, to, reenact, an, important, aspect, of, the, legend, at, turtle, and, shark, by, performing, a, ritual, song, intended, to, summon, the, legendary, animals, to, the, ocean, surface, and, visitors, are, frequently, amazed, to, see, one, or, both, of, these, creatures, emerge, from, the, sea, in, apparent, response, to, this, call, in, contrast, to, the, complex, portrayals, by, hawaiians, and, other, pacific, islanders, the, european, and, western, view, of, sharks, has, historically, been, mostly, of, fear, and, malevolence, sharks, are, used, in, popular, culture, commonly, as, eating, machines, notably, in, the, jaws, novel, and, the, film, of, the, same, name, along, with, its, sequels, sharks, are, threats, in, other, films, such, as, deep, blue, sea, the, reef, and, others, although, they, are, sometimes, used, for, comedic, effect, such, as, in, finding, nemo, and, the, austin, powers, series, sharks, tend, to, be, seen, quite, often, in, cartoons, whenever, a, scene, involves, the, ocean, such, examples, include, the, tom, and, jerry, cartoons, jabberjaw, and, other, shows, produced, by, hanna, barbera, they, also, are, used, commonly, as, a, clich, d, means, of, killing, off, a, character, that, is, held, up, by, a, rope, or, some, similar, object, as, the, sharks, swim, right, below, them, or, the, character, may, be, standing, on, a, plank, above, shark, infested, waters, a, popular, myth, is, that, sharks, are, immune, to, disease, and, cancer, but, this, is, not, scientifically, supported, sharks, have, been, known, to, get, cancer, both, diseases, and, parasites, affect, sharks, the, evidence, that, sharks, are, at, least, resistant, to, cancer, and, disease, is, mostly, anecdotal, and, there, have, been, few, if, any, scientific, or, statistical, studies, that, show, sharks, to, have, heightened, immunity, to, disease, other, apparently, false, claims, are, that, fins, prevent, cancer, and, treat, osteoarthritis, no, scientific, proof, supports, these, claims, at, least, one, study, has, shown, shark, cartilage, of, no, value, in, cancer, treatment, in, 2008, it, was, estimated, that, nearly, 100, million, sharks, were, being, killed, by, people, every, year, due, to, commercial, and, recreational, fishing, in, 2021, it, was, estimated, that, the, population, of, oceanic, sharks, and, rays, had, dropped, by, 71, over, the, previous, half, century, shark, finning, yields, are, estimated, at, 1, 44, million, metric, tons, 1, 59, million, short, tons, for, 2000, and, 1, 41, million, metric, tons, 1, 55, million, short, tons, for, 2010, based, on, an, analysis, of, average, shark, weights, this, translates, into, a, total, annual, mortality, estimate, of, about, 100, million, sharks, in, 2000, and, about, 97, million, sharks, in, 2010, with, a, total, range, of, possible, values, between, 63, and, 273, million, sharks, per, year, sharks, are, a, common, seafood, in, many, places,

known, species, of, sharks, and, rays, are, threatened, by, extinction, and, 25, species, were, classified, as, critically, endangered, in, 2014, a, shark, cull, in, western, australia, killed, dozens, of, sharks, mostly, tiger, sharks, using, drum, lines, until, it, was, cancelled, after, public, protests, and, a, decision, by, the, western, australia, epa, from, 2014, to, 2017, there, was, an, imminent, threat, policy, in, western, australia, in, which, sharks, that, threatened, humans, in, the, ocean, were, shot, and, killed, this, imminent, threat, policy, was, criticized, by, senator, rachel, siewart, for, killing, endangered, sharks, the, imminent, threat, policy, was, cancelled, in, march, 2017, in, august, 2018, the, western, australia, government, announced, a, plan, to, re, introduce, drum, lines, though, this, time, the, drum, lines, are, smart, drum, lines, from, 1962, to, the, present, the, government, of, queensland, has, targeted, and, killed, sharks, in, large, numbers, by, using, drum, lines, under, a, shark, control, program, this, program, has, also, inadvertently, killed, large, numbers, of, other, animals, such, as, dolphins, it, has, also, killed, endangered, hammerhead, sharks, queensland, s, drum, line, program, has, been, called, outdated, cruel, and, ineffective, from, 2001, to, 2018, a, total, of, 10, 480, sharks, were, killed, on, lethal, drum, lines, in, queensland, including, in, the, great, barrier, reef, from, 1962, to, 2018, roughly, 50, 000, sharks, were, killed, by, queensland, authorities, the, government, of, new, south, wales, has, a, program, that, deliberately, kills, sharks, using, nets, the, current, net, program, in, new, south, wales, has, been, described, as, being, extremely, destructive, to, marine, life, including, sharks, between, 1950, and, 2008, 352, tiger, sharks, and, 577, great, white, sharks, were, killed, in, the, nets, in, new, south, wales, also, during, this, period, a, total, of, 15, 135, marine, animals, were, killed, in, the, nets, including, dolphins, whales, turtles, dugongs, and, critically, endangered, grey, nurse, sharks, there, has, been, a, very, large, decrease, in, the, number, of, sharks, in, eastern, australia, and, the, shark, killing, programs, in, queensland, and, new, south, wales, are, partly, responsible, for, this, decrease, kwazulu, natal, an, area, of,

ecosystem, jessica, morris, of, humane, society, international, calls, shark, culling, a, knee, jerk, reaction, and, says, sharks, are, top, order, predators, that, play, an, important, role, in, the, functioning, of, marine, ecosystems, we, need, them, for, healthy, oceans, george, h, burgess, the, former, director, of, the, international, shark, attack, file, describes, culling, as, a, form, of, revenge, satisfying, a, public, demand, for, blood, and, little, else, he, also, said, shark, culling, is, a, retro, type, move, reminiscent, of, what, people, would, have, done, in, the, 1940s, and, 50s, back, when, we, didn, t, have, an, ecological, conscience, and, before, we, knew, the, consequences, of, our, actions, jane, williamson, an, associate, professor, in, marine, ecology, at, macquarie, university, says, there, is, no, scientific, support, for, the, concept, that, culling, sharks, in, a, particular, area, will, lead, to, a, decrease, in, shark, attacks, and, increase, ocean, safety, other, threats, include, habitat, alteration, damage, and, loss, from, coastal, development, pollution, and, the, impact, of, fisheries, on, the, seabed, and, prey, species, the, 2007, documentary, sharkwater, exposed, how, sharks, are, being, hunted, to, extinction, in, 1991, south, africa, was, the, first, country, in, the, world, to, declare, great, white, sharks, a, legally,

convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, cites, rejected, proposals, from, the, united, states, and, palau, that, would, have, required, countries, to, strictly, regulate, trade, in, several, species, of, scalloped, hammerhead, oceanic, whitetip, and, spiny, dogfish, sharks, the, majority, but, not, the, required, two, thirds, of, voting, delegates, approved, the, proposal,

therefore, the, approximate, locations, where, the, sharks, were, first, caught, using, dna, analysis, in, july, 2020, scientists, reported, results, of, a, survey, of, 371, reefs, in, 58, nations, estimating, the, conservation, status, of, reef, sharks, globally, no, sharks, have, been, observed, on, almost, 20, of, the, surveyed, reefs, and, shark, depletion, was, strongly, associated, with, both, socio, economic, conditions, and, conservation, measures, sharks, are, considered, to, be, a, vital, part, of, the, ocean, ecosystem, according, to, a, 2021, study, in, nature, overfishing, has, resulted, in, a, 71, global, decline, in, the, number, of, oceanic, sharks, and, rays, over, the, preceding, 50, years, the, oceanic, whitetip, and, both, the, scalloped, hammerhead, and, great, hammerheads, are, now, classified, as, critically, endangered, sharks, in, tropical, waters, have, declined, more, rapidly, than, those, in, temperate, zones, during, the, period, studied, a, 2021, study, published, in, current, biology, found, that, overfishing, is, currently, driving, over, one, third, of, sharks, and, rays, to, extinction
