pinnipeds, pronounced, p, n, p, d, z, commonly, known, as, seals, are, a, widely, distributed, and, diverse, clade, of, carnivorous, fin, footed, semiaquatic, mostly, marine, mammals, they, comprise, the, extant, families, odobenidae, whose, only, living, member, is, the, walrus, otariidae, the, eared, seals, sea, lions, and, fur, seals, and, phocidae, the, earless, seals, or, true, seals, with, 34, extant, species, and, more, than, 50, extinct, species, described, from, fossils, while, seals, were, historically, thought, to, have, descended, from, two, ancestral, lines, molecular, evidence, supports, them, as, a, monophyletic, group, descended, from, one, ancestor, pinnipeds, belong, to, the, suborder, caniformia, of, the, order, carnivora, their, closest, living, relatives, are, musteloids, weasels, raccoons, skunks, and, red, pandas, having, diverged, about, 50, million, years, ago, seals, range, in, size, from, the, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, and, 45, kg, 100, lb, baikal, seal, to, the, 5, m, 16, ft, and, 3, 200, kg, 7, 100, lb, southern, elephant, seal, several, species, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, they, have, streamlined, bodies, and, four, limbs, that, are, modified, into, flippers, though, not, as, fast, in, the, water, as, dolphins, seals, are, more, flexible, and, agile, otariids, primarily, use, their, front, limbs, to, propel, themselves, through, the, water, while, phocids, and, walruses, primarily, use, their, hind, limbs, for, this, purpose, otariids, and, walruses, have, hind, limbs, that, can, be, pulled, under, the, body, and, used, as, legs, on, land, by, comparison, terrestrial, locomotion, by, phocids, is, more, cumbersome, otariids, have, visible, external, ears, while, phocids, and, walruses, lack, these, pinnipeds, have, well, developed, senses, their, eyesight, and, hearing, are, adapted, for, both, air, and, water, and, they, have, an, advanced, tactile, system, in, their, whiskers, or, vibrissae, some, species, are, well, adapted, for, diving, to, great, depths, they, have, a, layer, of, fat, or, blubber, under, the, skin, to, keep, warm, in, cold, water, and, other, than, the, walrus, all, species, are, covered, in, fur, although, pinnipeds, are, widespread, most, species, prefer, the, colder, waters, of, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, they, spend, most, of, their, lives, in, water, but, come, ashore, to, mate, give, birth, molt, or, to, avoid, ocean, predators, such, as, sharks, and, orcas, seals, mainly, live, in, marine, environments, but, can, also, be, found, in, fresh, water, they, feed, largely, on, fish, and, marine, invertebrates, a, few, such, as, the, leopard, seal, feed, on, large, vertebrates, such, as, penguins, and, other, seals, walruses, are, specialized, for, feeding, on, bottom, dwelling, mollusks, male, pinnipeds, typically, mate, with, more, than, one, female, polygyny, though, the, degree, of, polygyny, varies, with, the, species, the, males, of, land, breeding, species, tend, to, mate, with, a, greater, number, of, females, than, those, of, ice, breeding, species, male, pinniped, strategies, for, reproductive, success, vary, between, defending, females, defending, territories, that, attract, females, and, performing, ritual, displays, or, lek, mating, pups, are, typically, born, in, the, spring, and, summer, months, and, females, bear, almost, all, the, responsibility, for, raising, them, mothers, of, some, species, fast, and, nurse, their, young, for, a, relatively, short, period, of, time, while, others, take, foraging, trips, at, sea, between, nursing, bouts, walruses, are, known, to, nurse, their, young, while, at, sea, seals, produce, a, number, of, vocalizations, notably, the, barks, of, california, sea, lions, the, gong, like, calls, of, walruses, and, the, complex, songs, of, weddell, seals, the, meat, blubber, and, skin, of, pinnipeds, have, traditionally, been, used, by, indigenous, peoples, of, the, arctic, seals, have, been, depicted, in, various, cultures, worldwide, they, are, commonly, kept, in, captivity, and, are, even, sometimes, trained, to, perform, tricks, and, tasks, once, relentlessly, hunted, by, commercial, industries, for, their, products, seals, are, now, protected, by, international, law, the, japanese, sea, lion, and, the, caribbean, monk, seal, have, become, extinct, in, the, past, century, while, the, mediterranean, monk, seal, and, hawaiian, monk, seal, are, ranked, as, endangered, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, besides, hunting, pinnipeds, also, face, threats, from, accidental, trapping, marine, pollution, climate, change, and, conflicts, with, local, people, the, name, pinniped, derives, from, the, latin, words, pinna, fin, and, pes, pedis, foot, the, common, name, seal, originates, from, the, old, english, word, seolh, which, is, in, turn, derived, from, the, proto, germanic, selkhaz, bearded, seal, hooded, seal, ringed, seal, baikal, seal, caspian, seal, spotted, seal, harbor, seal, grey, seal, ribbon, seal, harp, seal, weddell, seal, leopard, seal, crabeater, seal, ross, seal, southern, elephant, seal, northern, elephant, seal, mediterranean, monk, seal, hawaiian, monk, seal, northern, fur, seal, steller, sea, lion, california, sea, lion, gal, pagos, sea, lion, south, american, sea, lion, australian, sea, lion, new, zealand,

walrus, the, german, naturalist, johann, karl, wilhelm, illiger, was, the, first, to, recognize, the, pinnipeds, as, a, distinct, taxonomic, unit, in, 1811, he, gave, the, name, pinnipedia, to, both, a, family, and, an, order, american, zoologist, joel, asaph, allen, reviewed, the, world, s, pinnipeds, in, an, 1880, monograph, history, of, north, american, pinnipeds, a, monograph, of, the, walruses, sea, lions, sea, bears, and, seals, of, north, america, in, this, publication, he, traced, the, history, of, names, gave, keys, to, families, and, genera, described, north, american, species, and, provided, synopses, of, species, in, other, parts, of, the, world, in, 1989, annalisa, berta, and, colleagues, proposed, the, unranked, clade, pinnipedimorpha, to, contain, the, fossil, genus, enaliarctos, and, modern, seals, as, a, sister, group, pinnipeds, belong, to, the, order, carnivora, and, the, suborder, caniformia, known, as, dog, like, carnivorans, of, the, three, extant, families, the, otariidae, and, odobenidae, are, grouped, in, the, superfamily, otarioidea, while, the, phocidae, belong, to, the, superfamily, phocoidea, there, are, 34, extant, species, of, pinnipeds, and, more, than, 50, fossil, species, of, pinnipedimorphs, otariids, are, also, known, as, eared, seals, due, to, their, pinnae, these, animals, swim, mainly, using, their, well, developed, fore, flippers, they, can, also, walk, on, land, by, shifting, their, hind, flippers, forward, under, the, body, the, front, end, of, an, otariid, s, frontal, bone, protrudes, between, the, nasal, bones, with, a, large, and, flattened, supraorbital, foramen, an, extra, spine, splits, the, supraspinatous, fossa, and, bronchi, that, are, divided, in, the, front, otariids, consist, of, two, types, sea, lions, and, fur, seals, the, latter, typically, being, smaller, in, size, with, pointier, snouts, longer, fore, flippers, and, heavier, fur, coats, five, genera, and, seven, species, one, now, extinct, of, sea, lion, are, known, to, exist, while, two, genera, and, nine, species, of, fur, seal, exist, while, sea, lions, and, fur, seals, have, historically, been, considered, separate, subfamilies, otariinae, and, arctocephalinae, respectively, genetic, and, molecular, evidence, has, refuted, this, indicating, that, the, northern, fur, seal, is, basal, to, other, otariids, and, the, australian, sea, lion, and, new, zealand, sea, lion, are, more, closely, related, to, arctocephalus, than, to, other, sea, lions, odobenidae, has, only, one, living, member, the, walrus, this, animal, is, noticeable, from, its, larger, size, exceeded, only, by, the, elephant, seals, nearly, hairless, skin, flattened, snout, and, long, upper, canines, known, as, tusks, like, otariids, walruses, can, walk, on, land, with, their, hind, limbs, when, moving, in, water, the, walrus, relies, on, its, hind, limbs, for, locomotion, while, its, forelimbs, are, used, for, steering, also, it, has, no, outer, ears, the, epipterygoid, of, the, jaw, is, well, developed, and, the, back, of, the, nasal, bones, are, horizontal, in, the, feet, the, calcaneuses, protrude, in, the, middle, phocids, are, known, as, true, or, earless, seals, these, animals, lack, outer, ears, and, cannot, position, their, hind, flippers, to, move, on, land, making, them, more, cumbersome, this, is, because, of, their, massive, ankle, bones, and, flatter, heels, in, water, true, seals, rely, on, the, side, to, side, motion, of, their, hind, flippers, and, lower, body, to, move, forward, the, phocid, s, skull, has, thickened, mastoids, puffed, up, entotympanic, bones, nasal, bones, with, a, pointed, tip, in, the, back, and, a, non, existent, supraorbital, foramen, the, hip, has, a, more, converse, ilium, a, 2006, molecular, study, supports, the, division, of, phocids, into, two, monophyletic, subfamilies, monachinae, which, consists, of, elephant, seals, monk, seals, and, antarctic, seals, and, phocinae, which, consists, of, all, the, rest, one, popular, hypothesis, suggested, that, pinnipeds, are, diphyletic, descended, from, two, ancestral, lines, with, walruses, and, otariids, sharing, a, recent, common, ancestor, with, bears, and, phocids, sharing, one, with, musteloidea, however, morphological, and, molecular, evidence, support, a, monophyletic, origin, a, 2021, genetic, study, found, that, pinnipeds, are, more, closely, related, to, musteloids, pinnipeds, split, from, other, caniforms, 50, million, years, ago, mya, during, the, eocene, fossil, animals, representing, basal, lineages, include, puijila, of, the, early, miocene, in, arctic, canada, it, resembled, a, modern, otter, but, shows, evidence, of, quadrupedal, swimming, retaining, a, form, of, aquatic, locomotion, that, led, to, those, employed, by, modern, pinnipeds, potamotherium, which, lived, in, the, same, period, in, europe, was, similar, to, puijila, but, more, aquatic, the, braincase, of, potamotherium, shows, evidence, that, it, used, its, whiskers, to, hunt, like, modern, seals, both, puijila, and, potamotherium, fossils, have, been, found, in, lake, deposits, suggesting, that, seal, ancestors, were, originally, adapted, for, fresh, water, enaliarctos, a, fossil, species, of, late, oligocene, early, miocene, 24, 22, mya, california, closely, resembled, modern, pinnipeds, it, was, adapted, to, an, aquatic, life, with, flippers, and, a, flexible, spine, its, teeth, were, more, like, land, predators, in, that, they, were, more, adapted, for, shearing, its, hind, flippers, may, have, allowed, it, to, walk, on, land, and, it, probably, did, not, leave, coastal, areas, as, much, as, its, modern, relatives, enaliarctos, was, likely, more, of, a, fore, flipper, swimmer, but, could, probably, swim, with, either, pair, one, species, enaliarctos, emlongi, exhibited, notable, sexual, dimorphism, suggesting, that, this, physical, characteristic, may, have, been, an, important, driver, of, pinniped, evolution, a, closer, relative, of, extant, pinnipeds, was, pteronarctos, which, lived, in, oregon, 19, 15, mya, as, in, modern, seals, the, maxilla, or, upper, jaw, bone, of, pteroarctos, intersects, with, the, orbital, wall, the, extinct, family, desmatophocidae, lived, 23, 10, mya, in, the, north, pacific, they, had, long, skulls, that, with, large, orbits, interlocked, zygomatic, bones, and, rounded, molars, and, premolars, they, also, were, sexually, dimorphic, and, may, have, been, capable, of, swimming, with, both, or, either, pair, of, flippers, they, are, grouped, with, modern, pinnipeds, but, there, is, debate, as, to, whether, they, are, more, closely, related, to, phocids, or, to, otariids, and, walruses, the, ancestors, of, the, otarioidea, and, phocidea, diverged, around, 25, mya, phocids, are, known, to, have, existed, for, at, least, 15, million, years, and, molecular, evidence, supports, a, divergence, of, the, monachinae, and, phocinae, lineages, around, this, time, the, fossil, genera, monotherium, and, leptophoca, of, southeastern, north, america, represent, the, earliest, members, of, monachinae, and, phocinae, respectively, both, lineages, may, have, originated, in, the, north, atlantic, and, likely, reached, the, pacific, via, the, central, american, seaway, phocines, mainly, stayed, in, the, northern, hemisphere, while, the, monachines, diversified, southward, the, lineages, of, otariidae, and, odobenidae, split, around, 20, mya, the, earliest, fossil, records, of, otariids, are, in, north, pacific, and, dated, to, around, 11, mya, early, fossil, genera, include, pithanotaria, and, thalassoleon, the, callorhinus, lineage, split, the, earliest, followed, by, the, eumetopias, zalophus, lineage, and, then, the, rest, which, colonized, the, southern, hemisphere, the, earliest, fossils, of, odobenidae, prototaria, of, japan, and, proneotherium, of, oregon, date, to, 18, 16, mya, these, primitive, walruses, had, normal, sized, canines, and, fed, on, fish, instead, of, mollusks, later, taxa, like, gomphotaria, pontolis, and, dusignathus, had, longer, canines, on, both, the, upper, and, lower, jaw, the, familiar, long, upper, tusks, developed, in, the, genera, valenictus, and, odobenus, the, lineage, of, the, modern, walrus, may, have, spread, from, the, north, pacific, to, the, north, atlantic, through, the, caribbean, and, central, american, seaway, 8, 5, mya, and, then, back, to, the, north, pacific, via, the, arctic, 1, mya, or, to, the, arctic, and, subsequently, the, north, atlantic, during, the, pleistocene, pinnipeds, have, streamlined, spindle, shaped, bodies, with, small, or, non, existent, ear, flaps, rounded, heads, short, muzzles, flexible, necks, limbs, modified, into, flippers, and, small, tails, the, mammary, glands, and, genitals, can, withdraw, into, the, body, seals, are, unique, among, carnivorans, in, that, their, orbital, walls, are, mostly, shaped, by, the, maxilla, and, are, not, contained, by, certain, facial, bones, compared, to, land, carnivores, pinnipeds, have, fewer, teeth, which, are, pointed, and, cone, shaped, they, are, adapted, for, holding, onto, slippery, prey, rather, than, shearing, meat, like, the, carnassials, of, other, carnivorans, the, walrus, has, unique, tusks, which, are, long, upper, canines, pinnipeds, range, in, size, from, the, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, and, 45, kg, 100, lb, baikal, seal, to, the, 5, m, 16, ft, and, 3, 200, kg, 7, 100, lb, southern, elephant, seal, overall, they, tend, to, be, larger, than, other, carnivores, several, species, have, male, biased, sexual, dimorphism, that, depends, on, how, polygynous, a, species, is, highly, polygynous, species, like, elephant, seals, are, extremely, sexually, dimorphic, while, less, polygynous, species, have, males, and, females, that, are, closer, in, size, or, in, the, case, of, antarctic, seals, females, are, moderately, bigger, males, of, sexually, dimorphic, species, also, tend, to, have, secondary, sex, characteristics, such, as, larger, or, more, prominent, heads, necks, chests, crests, noses, proboscises, and, canine, teeth, as, well, as, thicker, fur, and, manes, though, more, polygynous, species, tend, to, be, sexually, dimorphic, some, evidence, suggests, that, size, differences, between, the, sexes, originated, due, to, ecological, differences, with, polygyny, developing, later, almost, all, pinnipeds, have, fur, coats, the, exception, being, the, walrus, which, is, only, sparsely, covered, even, some, fully, furred, species, particularly, sea, lions, are, less, furry, than, land, mammals, fur, seals, have, lush, coats, consisting, of, an, undercoat, and, guard, hairs, in, species, that, live, on, ice, young, pups, have, thicker, coats, than, adults, the, individual, hairs, on, the, coat, known, collectively, as, lanugo, can, trap, heat, from, sunlight, and, keep, the, pup, warm, pinnipeds, are, typically, countershaded, and, are, darker, colored, dorsally, and, lighter, colored, ventrally, which, serves, to, counter, the, effects, of, self, shadowing, caused, by, light, shining, over, the, ocean, water, the, pure, white, fur, of, harp, seal, pups, conceals, them, in, their, arctic, environment, several, species, have, clashing, patterns, of, light, and, dark, pigmentation, all, fully, furred, species, molt, the, process, of, which, may, be, quick, or, gradual, depending, on, the, species, seals, have, a, layer, of, subcutaneous, fat, known, as, blubber, that, is, particularly, thick, in, phocids, and, walruses, blubber, serves, both, to, keep, the, animals, warm, and, to, provide, energy, and, nourishment, when, they, are, fasting, it, can, constitute, as, much, as, 50, of, a, pinniped, s, mass, newborn, pups, have, a, thin, layer, of, blubber, but, some, species, compensate, for, this, with, thick, lanugos, the, simple, stomach, of, pinnipeds, is, typical, of, carnivores, most, species, have, neither, a, cecum, nor, a, clear, demarcation, between, the, small, and, large, intestines, the, large, intestine, is, comparatively, short, and, only, slightly, wider, than, the, small, intestine, small, intestine, lengths, range, from, 8, times, california, sea, lion, to, 25, times, elephant, seal, the, body, length, the, length, of, the, intestine, may, be, an, adaptation, to, frequent, deep, diving, allowing, for, more, room, in, the, digestive, tract, for, partially, digested, food, an, appendix, is, absent, in, seals, as, in, most, marine, mammals, the, kidneys, are, divided, into, lobes, and, filter, out, excess, salt, pinnipeds, have, two, pairs, of, flippers, on, the, front, and, back, the, fore, flippers, and, hind, flippers, their, elbows, and, ankles, are, not, externally, visible, pinnipeds, are, not, as, fast, as, cetaceans, typically, swimming, at, 5, 15, kn, 9, 28, km, h, 6, 17, mph, compared, to, around, 20, kn, 37, km, h, 23, mph, for, several, species, of, dolphin, seals, are, more, agile, and, flexible, and, some, otariids, such, as, the, california, sea, lion, can, make, dorsal, turns, as, the, back, of, their, heads, can, touch, their, hind, flippers, pinnipeds, have, several, adaptions, for, reducing, drag, in, addition, to, their, streamlined, bodies, they, have, smooth, networks, of, muscle, bundles, in, their, skin, that, may, increase, laminar, flow, and, cut, through, the, water, the, hair, erector, muscles, are, absent, so, their, fur, can, be, streamlined, as, they, swim, when, swimming, otariids, rely, on, their, fore, flippers, for, locomotion, in, a, wing, like, manner, similar, to, penguins, and, sea, turtles, fore, flipper, movement, is, not, continuous, and, the, animal, glides, between, each, stroke, compared, to, terrestrial, carnivorans, the, fore, limb, bones, of, otariids, are, reduced, in, length, giving, them, less, resistance, at, the, elbow, joint, as, the, flippers, flap, the, hind, flippers, maneuver, them, phocids, and, walruses, swim, by, moving, their, hind, flippers, and, lower, body, from, side, to, side, while, their, fore, flippers, are, mainly, used, for, maneuvering, some, species, leap, out, of, the, water, and, ride, waves, pinnipeds, can, move, around, on, land, though, not, as, well, as, terrestrial, animals, otariids, and, walruses, are, capable, of, turning, their, hind, flippers, forward, and, under, the, body, so, they, can, walk, on, all, fours, the, fore, flippers, move, along, a, transverse, plane, rather, than, the, sagittal, plane, like, the, limbs, of, land, mammals, otariids, create, momentum, by, laterally, swaying, their, heads, and, necks, sea, lions, have, been, recorded, climbing, up, flights, of, stairs, phocids, lack, the, ability, to, walk, on, their, hind, flippers, and, must, flop, and, wriggle, their, bodies, forward, as, their, fore, flippers, keep, them, stable, in, some, species, the, fore, flippers, may, act, like, oars, pushing, against, the, ground, phocids, can, move, faster, on, ice, as, they, are, able, to, slide, the, eyes, of, pinnipeds, are, relatively, large, for, their, size, and, are, positioned, near, the, front, of, the, head, only, the, smaller, eyes, of, the, walruses, are, located, on, each, side, of, the, head, since, they, forage, at, the, bottom, for, sedentary, mollusks, a, seal, s, eye, is, suited, for, seeing, both, underwater, and, in, air, most, of, retina, is, equidistant, around, the, spherical, lens, the, cornea, has, a, flattened, center, where, refraction, does, not, change, between, air, and, water, the, vascular, iris, has, a, strong, dilator, muscle, a, contracted, pupil, is, typically, pear, shaped, although, the, bearded, seal, s, is, more, horizontal, compared, to, deep, diving, elephant, seals, the, iris, of, shallower, species, such, as, harbor, seals, and, california, sea, lions, does, not, change, much, in, size, between, contraction, and, expansion, seals, are, able, to, see, in, darkness, with, a, tapetum, lucidum, a, reflecting, layer, that, increases, sensitivity, by, reflecting, light, back, through, the, rods, on, land, pinnipeds, are, near, sighted, in, dim, light, this, is, reduced, in, bright, light, as, the, retracted, pupil, decreases, the, ability, of, the, lens, and, the, cornea, to, refract, bend, light, polar, living, seals, like, the, harp, seal, have, corneas, that, are, adapted, to, the, bright, light, that, reflects, off, snow, and, ice, as, such, they, do, not, suffer, snow, blindness, pinnipeds, appear, to, have, limited, color, vision, as, they, lack, s, cones, flexible, eye, movement, has, been, documented, in, seals, the, walrus, can, project, its, eyes, out, from, its, sockets, in, both, a, forward, and, upward, direction, due, to, its, advanced, extraocular, muscles, and, absence, of, an, orbital, roof, the, seal, eye, is, durable, as, the, corneal, epithelium, is, hardened, by, keratin, and, the, sclera, is, thick, enough, to, withstand, the, pressures, of, diving, seals, also, secrete, mucus, from, the, lacrimal, gland, to, protect, their, eyes, as, in, many, mammals, and, birds, pinnipeds, possess, nictitating, membranes, the, pinniped, ear, is, adapted, for, hearing, underwater, where, it, can, hear, sound, frequencies, of, up, to, 70, 000, hz, in, air, hearing, is, somewhat, reduced, in, pinnipeds, compared, to, many, terrestrial, mammals, while, their, airborne, hearing, sensitivity, is, generally, weaker, than, humans, they, still, have, a, wide, frequency, range, one, study, of, three, species, the, harbor, seal, california, sea, lion, and, northern, elephant, seal, found, that, the, sea, lion, was, best, adapted, for, airborne, hearing, the, elephant, seal, for, underwater, hearing, and, the, harbor, seal, was, equally, adapted, for, both, although, pinnipeds, have, a, fairly, good, sense, of, smell, on, land, it, is, useless, under, water, as, their, nostrils, are, closed, pinnipeds, have, well, developed, tactile, senses, compared, to, terrestrial, mammals, the, moustache, like, whiskers, or, vibrissae, of, pinnipeds, have, ten, times, more, nerve, connections, allowing, them, to, effectively, detect, vibrations, in, the, water, these, vibrations, are, generated, for, example, when, a, fish, swims, through, water, detecting, vibrations, is, useful, when, the, animals, are, foraging, and, may, add, to, or, even, replace, vision, particularly, in, darkness, harbor, seals, can, follow, hydrodynamic, paths, made, by, other, animals, minutes, earlier, similar, to, a, dog, following, a, scent, trail, and, even, to, discriminate, the, size, and, type, of, object, responsible, for, the, trail, unlike, terrestrial, mammals, such, as, rodents, pinnipeds, do, not, sweep, their, whiskers, over, an, object, when, examining, it, but, can, protract, the, hairs, forward, while, holding, them, steady, maximizing, their, detection, the, vibrissa, s, angle, relative, to, the, flow, seems, to, be, the, most, important, contributor, to, detection, ability, the, whiskers, of, some, otariids, grow, quite, long, those, of, the, antarctic, fur, seal, can, reach, 41, cm, 16, in, walruses, have, the, most, vibrissae, at, 600, 700, individual, hairs, these, are, important, when, searching, for, prey, along, the, bottom, in, addition, to, foraging, whiskers, may, also, play, a, role, in, navigation, spotted, seals, appear, to, use, them, to, detect, breathing, holes, in, the, ice, to, dive, a, pinniped, must, first, exhale, much, of, the, air, out, of, its, lungs, and, shut, its, nostrils, and, throat, cartilages, to, protect, the, trachea, the, airways, are, supported, by, cartilaginous, rings, and, smooth, muscle, and, the, chest, muscles, and, alveoli, can, completely, deflate, during, deeper, dives, while, land, mammals, generally, cannot, empty, their, lungs, pinnipeds, can, reinflate, their, lungs, even, after, respiratory, collapse, the, middle, ear, contains, sinuses, that, probably, fill, with, blood, during, dives, preventing, middle, ear, squeeze, the, heart, of, a, seal, is, moderately, flattened, to, allow, the, lungs, to, deflate, the, trachea, is, flexible, enough, to, collapse, under, pressure, during, deep, dives, any, remaining, air, in, their, bodies, is, stored, in, the, bronchioles, and, trachea, which, prevents, them, from, experiencing, decompression, sickness, oxygen, toxicity, and, nitrogen, narcosis, in, addition, seals, can, tolerate, large, amounts, of, lactic, acid, which, reduces, skeletal, muscle, fatigue, during, intense, physical, activity, the, circulatory, system, of, pinnipeds, is, large, and, elaborate, retia, mirabilia, line, the, inside, of, the, trunk, and, limbs, allowing, for, greater, oxygen, storage, during, diving, as, with, other, diving, mammals, pinnipeds, have, large, amounts, of, hemoglobin, and, myoglobin, stored, in, their, blood, and, muscles, this, allows, them, to, stay, submerged, for, long, periods, of, time, while, still, having, enough, oxygen, deep, diving, species, such, as, elephant, seals, have, blood, volumes, that, represent, up, to, 20, of, their, body, weight, when, diving, they, reduce, their, heart, rate, and, blood, flow, is, mostly, restricted, to, the, heart, brain, and, lungs, to, keep, their, blood, pressure, stable, phocids, have, an, elastic, aorta, that, dissipates, some, of, the, energy, of, each, heartbeat, pinnipeds, keep, warm, by, having, large, thick, bodies, insulating, blubber, and, fur, and, fast, metabolism, also, the, blood, vessels, in, their, flippers, are, adapted, for, countercurrent, exchange, small, veins, surround, arteries, transporting, blood, from, the, body, core, capturing, heat, from, them, while, blubber, and, fur, keep, the, seal, warm, in, water, they, can, also, overheat, the, animal, when, it, is, on, land, to, counteract, overheating, many, species, cool, off, by, covering, themselves, in, sand, monk, seals, may, even, dig, up, the, cooler, layers, the, northern, fur, seal, cools, off, by, panting, pinnipeds, spend, many, months, at, a, time, at, sea, so, they, must, sleep, in, the, water, scientists, have, recorded, them, sleeping, for, minutes, at, a, time, while, slowly, drifting, downward, in, a, belly, up, orientation, like, other, marine, mammals, seals, sleep, in, water, with, half, of, their, brain, awake, so, that, they, can, detect, and, escape, from, predators, as, well, as, surface, for, air, without, fully, waking, when, they, are, asleep, on, land, both, sides, of, their, brain, go, into, sleep, mode, living, pinnipeds, are, widespread, in, cold, oceanic, waters, particularly, in, the, north, atlantic, the, north, pacific, and, the, southern, ocean, by, contrast, the, consistently, warm, indomalayan, waters, have, no, seals, monk, seals, and, some, otariids, live, in, tropical, and, subtropical, waters, seals, usually, require, cool, nutrient, rich, waters, with, temperatures, lower, than, 20, c, 68, f, even, in, more, tropical, climates, lower, temperatures, and, biological, productivity, may, be, provided, by, currents, only, monk, seals, live, in, waters, that, generally, lack, these, features, the, caspian, seal, and, baikal, seal, are, found, in, large, landlocked, bodies, of, water, the, caspian, sea, and, lake, baikal, respectively, as, a, whole, pinnipeds, can, be, found, in, a, variety, of, aquatic, habitats, mostly, coastal, water, but, also, open, ocean, deep, waters, near, offshore, islands, brackish, waters, and, even, freshwater, lakes, and, rivers, the, baikal, seal, is, the, only, exclusively, freshwater, species, pinnipeds, also, use, a, number, of, terrestrial, habitats, and, substrates, both, continental, and, island, in, non, polar, regions, they, haul, out, on, to, rocky, shores, sandy, and, pebble, beaches, sandbanks, tidal, flats, or, pools, and, in, sea, caves, some, species, also, rest, on, man, made, structures, built, along, the, coast, or, offshore, pinnipeds, may, move, further, from, the, water, using, sand, dunes, or, vegetation, or, even, rocky, cliffs, new, zealand, sea, lions, may, travel, to, forests, 2, kilometres, 1, 2, mi, from, the, ocean, in, polar, regions, seals, haul, out, on, to, both, fast, ice, and, drift, ice, some, even, den, underneath, the, ice, particularly, in, pressure, ridges, and, crevasses, pinnipeds, have, an, amphibious, lifestyle, they, are, mostly, aquatic, but, haul, out, to, breed, molt, rest, sun, or, to, avoid, aquatic, predators, several, species, are, known, to, migrate, over, vast, distances, particularly, in, response, to, environmental, changes, elephant, seals, are, at, sea, for, most, of, the, year, and, there, are, vast, distances, between, their, breeding, and, molting, sites, the, northern, elephant, seal, is, one, of, farthest, mammalian, migraters, traveling, 18, 000, 21, 000, km, 11, 000, 13, 000, mi, otariids, tend, to, migrate, less, than, phocids, especially, tropical, species, traveling, seals, may, reach, their, destination, using, geomagnetic, fields, water, and, wind, currents, solar, and, lunar, positions, and, the, temperature, and, chemical, makeup, of, the, water, pinnipeds, may, dive, during, foraging, or, to, avoid, predators, when, foraging, for, example, the, weddell, seal, typically, dives, for, no, more, than, 15, minutes, and, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, deep, but, can, dive, for, as, long, as, 73, minutes, and, reach, 600, m, 2, 000, ft, deep, northern, elephant, seals, often, dive, 350, 650, m, 1, 100, 2, 100, ft, for, as, long, as, 20, minutes, they, can, also, dive, 1, 500, m, 4, 900, ft, and, for, over, an, hour, the, dives, of, otariids, tend, to, be, shorter, and, less, deep, they, typically, last, 5, 7, minutes, with, average, depths, to, 30, 45, m, 100, 150, ft, however, the, new, zealand, sea, lion, has, been, recorded, diving, to, a, maximum, of, 460, m, 1, 510, ft, and, have, submerged, for, as, long, as, 12, minutes, the, diet, of, walruses, does, not, require, them, to, dive, very, deep, or, very, long, pinnipeds, generally, live, 25, 30, years, all, pinnipeds, are, carnivorous, and, predatory, as, a, whole, they, mostly, feed, on, fish, and, cephalopods, but, also, consume, crustaceans, bivalves, zooplankton, and, endothermic, warm, blooded, prey, like, sea, birds, while, most, species, have, generalist, diets, a, few, are, specialists, examples, are, krill, eating, crabeater, seals, crustacean, eating, ringed, seals, squid, specialists, like, the, ross, seal, and, southern, elephant, seal, and, the, bearded, seal, and, walrus, which, specialize, on, benthic, invertebrates, pinnipeds, may, hunt, solitarily, or, cooperatively, the, former, behavior, is, typical, when, hunting, non, schooling, fish, immobile, or, sluggish, invertebrates, and, endothermic, prey, solitary, foraging, species, usually, hunt, in, coastal, or, shallow, water, an, exception, to, this, is, the, northern, elephant, seal, which, hunts, deep, in, the, open, ocean, for, fish, in, addition, walruses, feed, solitarily, but, are, often, near, other, walruses, in, small, or, large, groups, for, large, schools, of, fish, or, squid, pinnipeds, such, as, certain, otariids, hunt, cooperatively, in, large, groups, locating, and, herding, their, prey, some, species, such, as, california, and, south, american, sea, lions, will, hunt, alongside, sea, birds, and, cetaceans, seals, typically, swallow, their, food, whole, and, will, rip, apart, prey, that, is, too, big, the, leopard, seal, a, prolific, predator, of, penguins, is, known, to, violently, shake, its, prey, to, death, complex, serrations, in, the, teeth, of, filter, feeding, species, such, as, crabeater, seals, allow, water, to, leak, out, as, they, swallow, their, planktonic, food, the, walrus, is, unique, in, that, it, consumes, its, prey, by, suction, feeding, using, its, tongue, to, suck, the, meat, of, a, bivalve, out, of, the, shell, while, pinnipeds, mostly, hunt, in, the, water, south, american, sea, lions, are, known, to, chase, down, penguins, on, land, some, species, may, swallow, stones, or, pebbles, for, reasons, not, understood, though, they, can, drink, seawater, pinnipeds, get, most, of, their, fluid, intake, from, their, food, pinnipeds, themselves, are, subject, to, predation, most, species, are, preyed, on, by, the, orca, to, subdue, and, kill, seals, orcas, strike, them, with, their, heads, or, tails, the, latter, causing, them, to, fly, in, the, air, or, simply, bite, into, them, and, rip, them, apart, they, are, typically, hunted, by, groups, of, 10, or, fewer, whales, but, they, are, occasionally, hunted, by, larger, groups, or, by, lone, individuals, all, age, classes, may, be, targeted, but, pups, most, of, all, large, sharks, are, another, major, predator, of, pinnipeds, usually, the, great, white, shark, but, also, the, tiger, shark, and, mako, shark, sharks, usually, attack, by, ambushing, them, from, below, injured, seals, that, escape, are, usually, able, to, recover, from, their, wounds, otariids, that, have, been, targeted, in, the, hindquarters, are, more, likely, to, survive, while, phocids, are, more, likely, to, survive, with, forequarters, injures, pinnipeds, are, also, preyed, on, by, terrestrial, and, pagophilic, predators, the, polar, bear, is, a, major, predator, of, arctic, seals, and, walruses, particularly, pups, bears, may, seek, out, seals, or, simply, wait, for, them, to, come, by, other, terrestrial, predators, include, cougars, brown, hyenas, and, various, species, of, canids, which, mostly, target, the, young, pinnipeds, lessen, the, chance, of, predation, by, gathering, in, groups, some, species, are, capable, of, inflicting, damaging, wounds, on, their, attackers, with, their, sharp, canines, adult, walruses, are, particularly, risky, prey, for, polar, bears, when, out, at, sea, northern, elephant, seals, dive, out, of, the, reach, of, surface, hunting, orcas, and, white, sharks, in, the, antarctic, which, lacks, terrestrial, predators, pinniped, species, spend, more, time, on, the, ice, than, their, arctic, counterparts, interspecific, predation, among, pinnipeds, does, occur, the, leopard, seal, is, known, to, prey, on, many, other, species, especially, the, crabeater, seal, leopard, seals, typically, target, crabeater, pups, particularly, from, november, to, january, older, crabeater, seals, commonly, bear, scars, from, failed, leopard, seal, attacks, a, 1977, study, found, that, 75, of, a, sample, of, 85, individual, crabeaters, had, these, scars, walruses, despite, being, specialized, for, feeding, on, bottom, dwelling, invertebrates, occasionally, prey, on, arctic, seals, they, kill, their, prey, with, their, long, tusks, and, eat, their, blubber, and, skin, steller, sea, lions, have, been, recorded, eating, harbor, seals, northern, fur, seals, and, california, sea, lions, particularly, pups, and, small, adults, new, zealand, sea, lions, feed, on, pups, of, some, fur, seal, species, and, the, south, american, sea, lion, may, prey, on, south, american, fur, seals, the, mating, system, of, pinnipeds, varies, from, extreme, polygyny, to, serial, monogamy, of, the, 33, species, 20, breed, on, land, and, the, remaining, 13, breed, on, ice, species, that, breed, on, land, are, usually, polygynous, as, females, gather, in, large, aggregations, and, males, are, able, to, mate, with, them, as, well, as, defend, them, from, rivals, polygynous, species, include, elephant, seals, grey, seals, and, most, otariids, land, breeding, pinnipeds, prefer, to, mate, on, islands, where, there, are, fewer, land, predators, suitable, islands, are, in, short, supply, and, tend, to, be, crowded, since, the, land, they, breed, on, is, fixed, females, return, to, the, same, sites, for, many, years, the, males, arrive, earlier, in, the, season, and, wait, for, them, the, males, stay, on, land, to, monopolize, females, and, may, fast, for, months, as, they, would, lose, their, position, if, they, went, to, feed, at, sea, polygynous, species, also, tend, to, be, extremely, sexual, dimorphic, in, favor, of, males, this, dimorphism, manifests, itself, in, larger, chests, and, necks, longer, canines, and, denser, fur, all, traits, that, equip, males, for, combat, larger, males, have, more, blubber, and, thus, more, energy, reserves, for, fasting, other, seals, like, the, walrus, and, most, phocids, breed, on, ice, and, copulate, in, the, water, a, few, land, breeding, species, also, mate, in, water, females, of, these, species, tend, to, be, more, spaced, out, and, there, is, less, site, fidelity, since, ice, is, less, stable, than, solid, land, hence, polygyny, tends, to, be, weaker, in, ice, breeding, species, an, exception, to, this, is, the, walrus, whose, distribution, of, food, forces, females, closer, together, pinnipeds, that, breed, on, fast, ice, tend, to, cluster, together, more, than, those, that, breed, on, drift, ice, seals, that, breed, on, ice, tend, to, have, little, or, no, sexual, dimorphism, in, antarctic, seals, there, is, some, size, bias, in, favor, of, females, walruses, and, hooded, seals, are, unique, among, ice, breeding, species, in, that, they, have, pronounced, sexual, dimorphism, in, favor, of, males, adult, male, pinnipeds, have, several, strategies, to, ensure, reproductive, success, otariid, males, gain, access, to, females, by, establishing, territories, where, females, can, bask, and, give, birth, and, contain, valuable, resources, such, as, shade, tide, pools, or, access, to, water, territories, are, usually, marked, by, natural, barriers, and, some, may, be, fully, or, partially, underwater, males, defend, their, territorial, boundaries, with, threatening, vocalizations, and, postures, but, physical, fights, are, usually, not, very, violent, and, are, mostly, limited, to, early, in, the, season, individuals, also, return, to, the, same, territorial, site, each, breeding, season, in, certain, species, like, the, steller, sea, lion, and, northern, fur, seal, a, dominant, male, can, maintain, a, territory, for, as, long, as, 2, 3, months, females, can, usually, move, freely, between, territories, and, males, are, unable, to, coerce, them, but, in, some, species, such, as, the, northern, fur, seal, south, american, sea, lion, and, australian, sea, lion, males, can, successfully, keep, females, in, their, territories, with, threatening, displays, and, even, violence, in, some, phocid, species, like, the, harbor, seal, weddell, seal, and, bearded, seal, the, males, establish, maritories, and, patrol, and, defend, the, waters, bordering, female, haul, out, areas, waiting, for, a, female, to, enter, these, are, also, maintained, by, vocalizations, the, maritories, of, weddell, seal, males, include, entries, to, female, breathing, holes, in, the, ice, lek, systems, are, known, to, exist, among, some, populations, of, walruses, these, males, gather, near, female, herds, and, try, to, attract, them, with, elaborate, courtship, displays, and, vocalizations, lekking, may, also, exist, among, california, sea, lions, south, american, fur, seals, new, zealand, sea, lions, and, harbor, seals, in, some, species, including, elephant, seals, grey, seals, and, non, lekking, walruses, males, will, try, to, lay, claim, to, the, desired, females, and, defend, them, from, rivals, elephant, seal, males, in, particular, establish, dominance, hierarchies, via, displays, and, fights, with, the, highest, ranking, males, having, a, near, monopoly, on, reproductive, success, an, alpha, male, can, have, a, harem, of, 100, females, grey, seal, males, usually, place, themselves, among, a, cluster, of, females, whose, members, may, change, over, time, while, males, of, some, walrus, populations, guard, female, herds, male, ringed, crabeater, spotted, and, hooded, seals, follow, and, defend, nearby, females, and, mate, with, them, when, they, reach, estrus, these, may, be, lone, females, or, small, groups, younger, or, subdominant, male, pinnipeds, may, attempt, to, achieve, reproductive, success, in, other, ways, including, sneakiness, harassment, of, females, or, even, coordinated, disruption, of, the, colony, female, pinnipeds, do, appear, to, have, some, choice, in, mates, particularly, in, lek, breeding, species, like, the, walrus, but, also, in, elephant, seals, where, the, males, try, to, dominate, all, the, females, that, they, want, to, mate, with, when, a, female, elephant, seal, or, grey, seal, is, mounted, by, an, unwanted, male, she, tries, to, resist, and, get, away, this, commotion, attracts, other, males, to, the, scene, and, the, most, dominant, will, take, over, and, mate, with, female, himself, dominant, female, elephant, seals, stay, in, the, center, of, the, colony, where, they, in, the, domain, of, a, more, dominant, male, while, marginal, females, are, left, with, subordinates, female, steller, sea, lions, may, solicit, their, territorial, males, for, mating, except, for, the, walrus, which, has, five, to, six, year, gaps, between, births, female, pinnipeds, enter, estrus, shortly, after, they, give, birth, and, can, thus, produce, pups, every, year, all, species, have, delayed, implantation, in, which, the, embryo, does, not, enter, the, uterus, for, weeks, or, months, delayed, implantation, allows, the, female, to, wait, until, conditions, are, right, for, birthing, gestation, in, seals, including, delayed, implantation, typically, lasts, a, year, for, most, species, birthing, takes, place, in, spring, and, summer, usually, single, pups, are, born, twins, are, rare, and, have, high, mortality, rates, pups, of, most, species, are, born, relatively, developed, and, precocial, pinniped, milk, has, little, to, no, lactose, mother, pinnipeds, have, different, strategies, for, maternal, care, and, lactation, phocids, such, as, elephant, seals, grey, seals, and, hooded, seals, have, a, lactation, period, that, lasts, days, or, weeks, during, which, they, fast, and, nurse, their, pups, on, land, or, ice, the, milk, of, these, species, consists, of, up, to, 60, fat, allowing, the, young, to, grow, quickly, each, day, until, they, are, weaned, northern, elephant, seal, pups, gain, 4, kg, 9, lb, some, pups, gain, weight, more, quickly, than, others, by, stealing, extra, milk, from, other, mothers, alloparenting, occurs, in, these, fasting, species, while, most, northern, elephant, seal, mothers, nurse, their, own, pups, and, reject, nursings, from, alien, pups, some, do, accept, alien, pups, with, their, own, for, otariids, and, some, phocids, like, the, harbor, seal, mothers, fast, and, nurse, their, pups, for, a, few, days, at, a, time, in, between, nursing, bouts, the, females, forage, at, sea, while, the, young, stay, behind, onshore, if, there, is, enough, food, close, to, shore, a, female, can, be, gone, for, as, little, as, a, day, but, otherwise, may, be, at, sea, for, as, long, as, three, weeks, lactation, in, otariids, may, last, 6, 11, months, in, the, gal, pagos, fur, seal, it, can, last, up, to, 3, years, pups, of, these, species, are, weaned, at, heavier, weights, than, their, phocid, counterparts, but, the, latter, grow, quicker, walruses, are, unique, in, that, mothers, nurse, their, young, at, sea, young, pinnipeds, typically, start, swimming, on, their, own, and, some, species, can, even, swim, as, newborns, young, may, wait, days, or, weeks, before, entering, the, water, elephant, seals, start, swimming, weeks, after, weaning, male, pinnipeds, generally, play, little, role, in, raising, the, young, male, walruses, may, help, inexperienced, young, as, they, learn, to, swim, and, have, even, been, recorded, caring, for, orphans, when, a, group, is, threatened, all, the, adults, may, protect, the, young, male, california, sea, lions, have, been, observed, to, help, shield, swimming, pups, from, predators, males, can, also, pose, threats, to, the, safety, of, pups, particularly, during, fights, pups, of, some, species, may, be, abducted, assaulted, and, killed, by, males, pinnipeds, can, produce, a, number, of, vocalizations, while, most, vocals, are, audible, to, the, human, ear, weddell, seals, have, been, recorded, in, antarctica, making, ultrasonic, calls, underwater, in, addition, the, vocals, of, northern, elephant, seals, may, produce, infrasonic, vibrations, vocals, are, produced, both, in, air, and, underwater, the, former, are, more, common, among, otariids, and, the, latter, among, phocids, antarctic, seals, are, noisier, on, land, or, ice, than, arctic, seals, due, to, the, absence, of, polar, bears, male, vocals, are, usually, deeper, than, those, of, the, females, vocalizations, are, particularly, important, during, the, breeding, seasons, dominant, male, elephant, seals, display, their, status, and, power, with, clap, threats, and, loud, drum, like, calls, that, may, be, modified, by, the, proboscis, male, otariids, have, strong, barks, growls, and, roars, male, walruses, are, known, to, produce, gong, like, calls, when, attempting, to, attract, females, these, are, amplified, underwater, with, inflatable, throat, sacs, the, weddell, seal, has, perhaps, the, most, extensive, vocal, repertoire, producing, both, airborne, and, underwater, sounds, trilling, gluping, chirping, chugging, and, knocking, are, some, examples, of, the, calls, produced, underwater, when, warning, other, seals, the, calls, may, be, pronounced, by, prefixes, and, suffixes, the, underwater, vocals, of, weddell, seals, can, last, 70, seconds, which, is, long, for, a, marine, mammal, call, some, calls, have, about, seven, rhythm, patterns, and, could, be, categorized, as, songs, similar, calls, have, been, recorded, in, other, antarctic, seals, and, in, bearded, seals, in, some, pinniped, species, there, appear, to, be, regional, dialects, or, even, individual, variations, in, vocalizations, these, differences, are, likely, important, for, territorial, males, becoming, accustomed, to, their, neighbors, dear, enemy, effect, and, mothers, and, pups, who, need, to, remain, in, contact, on, crowded, beaches, female, seals, emit, a, pulsed, bawling, contact, call, while, pups, respond, by, squawking, contact, calls, are, particularly, important, for, otariid, mothers, returning, from, sea, other, vocalizations, produced, by, seals, include, grunts, rasps, rattles, creaks, warbles, clicks, and, whistles, non, vocal, communication, is, not, as, common, in, pinnipeds, as, in, cetaceans, nevertheless, when, they, feel, threatened, hauled, out, harbor, seals, and, baikal, seals, may, slap, themselves, with, their, flippers, to, create, a, warning, sound, teeth, chattering, hisses, and, exhalations, are, also, made, as, aggressive, warnings, by, pinnipeds, visual, displays, also, occur, ross, seals, resting, on, the, ice, will, show, the, stripes, on, their, chests, and, bare, their, teeth, to, a, perceived, threat, while, swimming, weddell, seals, will, make, an, s, shaped, posture, to, intimidate, rivals, under, the, ice, male, hooded, seals, use, their, inflatable, nasal, membranes, to, display, to, and, attract, females, in, a, match, to, sample, task, study, a, single, california, sea, lion, was, able, to, demonstrate, an, understanding, of, symmetry, transitivity, and, equivalence, a, second, seal, was, unable, to, complete, the, tasks, they, demonstrate, the, ability, to, understand, simple, syntax, and, commands, when, taught, an, artificial, sign, language, though, they, only, rarely, used, the, signs, semantically, or, logically, in, 2011, a, captive, california, sea, lion, named, ronan, was, recorded, bobbing, its, head, in, synchrony, to, musical, rhythms, this, rhythmic, entrainment, was, previously, seen, only, in, humans, parrots, and, other, birds, possessing, vocal, mimicry, adult, male, elephant, seals, can, recognize, each, other, s, vocalizations, by, remembering, the, rhythm, and, timbre, in, the, 1970s, a, captive, harbor, seal, named, hoover, was, trained, to, imitate, human, speech, and, laughter, for, sea, lions, used, in, entertainment, trainers, toss, a, ball, at, the, animal, or, simply, place, the, object, on, its, nose, so, it, will, eventually, understand, the, behavior, desired, a, sea, lion, may, need, a, year, of, training, before, it, can, publicly, perform, its, long, term, memory, allows, it, to, perform, a, trick, after, as, much, as, three, months, of, non, performance, various, human, cultures, have, for, millennia, depicted, pinnipeds, in, homer, s, odyssey, the, sea, god, proteus, shepherds, a, colony, of, seals, in, northern, scotland, celts, of, orkney, and, the, hebrides, believed, in, selkies, seals, that, could, change, into, humans, and, walk, on, land, in, inuit, mythology, they, are, associated, with, the, goddess, sedna, who, sometimes, transformed, into, a, seal, it, was, believed, that, marine, mammals, including, seals, came, from, her, severed, fingers, in, modern, culture, pinnipeds, are, thought, of, as, cute, playful, and, comical, figures, pinnipeds, can, be, found, in, facilities, around, the, world, as, their, size, and, playfulness, make, them, popular, attractions, seals, have, been, kept, in, captivity, since, at, least, ancient, rome, and, their, trainability, was, noticed, by, pliny, the, elder, zoologist, georges, cuvier, noted, during, the, 19th, century, that, wild, seals, show, considerable, affection, for, humans, and, stated, that, they, are, second, only, to, some, monkeys, among, wild, animals, in, their, easy, tamability, francis, galton, noted, in, his, seminal, work, on, domestication, that, seals, were, a, spectacular, example, of, an, animal, that, would, most, likely, never, be, domesticated, despite, their, friendliness, survivability, and, desire, for, comfort, because, they, serve, no, practical, use, for, humans, some, modern, exhibits, have, a, pool, with, artificial, haul, out, sites, and, a, rocky, background, while, others, have, seals, housed, in, shelters, located, above, a, pool, which, they, can, jump, into, more, elaborate, exhibits, contain, deep, pools, that, can, be, viewed, underwater, with, rock, mimicking, cement, as, haul, out, areas, the, most, popular, captive, pinniped, is, the, california, sea, lion, due, to, its, trainability, and, adaptability, other, commonly, kept, species, include, the, grey, seal, and, harbor, seal, larger, animals, like, walruses, and, steller, sea, lions, are, much, less, common, some, organizations, such, as, the, humane, society, of, the, united, states, and, world, animal, protection, object, to, keeping, marine, mammals, in, captivity, they, state, that, the, exhibits, could, not, be, large, enough, to, house, animals, that, have, evolved, to, be, migratory, and, a, pool, could, never, replace, the, size, and, biodiversity, of, the, ocean, they, also, state, that, the, tricks, performed, for, audiences, are, exaggerated, variations, of, their, natural, behaviors, and, distract, the, people, from, the, animal, s, unnatural, environment, california, sea, lions, are, used, in, military, applications, by, the, u, s, navy, marine, mammal, program, including, detecting, naval, mines, and, enemy, divers, in, the, persian, gulf, the, animals, have, been, trained, to, swim, behind, divers, approaching, a, u, s, naval, ship, and, attach, a, clamp, with, a, rope, to, the, diver, s, leg, navy, officials, say, that, the, sea, lions, can, do, this, in, seconds, before, the, enemy, realizes, what, happened, organizations, like, peta, believe, that, such, operations, put, the, animals, in, danger, the, navy, insists, that, the, sea, lions, are, removed, once, their, job, is, done, humans, have, hunted, seals, since, the, stone, age, originally, seals, were, merely, hit, with, clubs, during, haul, out, eventually, more, lethal, weapons, were, used, like, spears, and, harpoons, they, were, also, trapped, in, nets, the, use, of, firearms, in, seal, hunting, during, the, modern, era, drastically, increased, the, number, of, killings, pinnipeds, are, typically, hunted, for, their, meat, and, blubber, the, skins, of, fur, seals, and, phocids, are, made, into, coats, and, the, tusks, of, walruses, have, been, used, as, ivory, there, is, a, distinction, made, between, the, subsistence, hunting, of, seals, by, indigenous, peoples, of, the, arctic, and, commercial, hunting, subsistence, hunters, depend, on, seal, products, for, survival, national, and, international, authorities, have, given, special, treatment, to, aboriginal, hunters, since, their, methods, of, killing, are, seen, as, more, sustainable, and, smaller, in, scope, however, indigenous, people, have, recently, used, more, modern, technology, and, are, profiting, more, from, seal, products, in, the, marketplace, some, anthropologists, argue, that, the, term, subsistence, should, also, apply, to, these, activities, as, long, as, they, are, local, in, scale, more, than, 100, 000, phocids, especially, ringed, seals, as, well, as, around, 10, 000, walruses, are, harvested, annually, by, native, hunters, commercial, sealing, rivaled, whaling, as, an, important, industry, throughout, history, harvested, species, included, harp, seals, hooded, seals, caspian, seals, elephant, seals, walruses, and, all, species, of, fur, seal, after, the, 1960s, the, harvesting, of, seals, decreased, substantially, as, an, industry, after, the, canadian, government, implemented, measures, to, protect, female, seals, and, restrict, the, hunting, season, several, species, that, were, commercially, exploited, have, rebounded, in, numbers, for, example, antarctic, fur, seals, may, have, reached, their, pre, harvesting, numbers, the, northern, elephant, seal, nearly, went, extinct, in, the, late, 19th, century, with, only, a, small, population, remaining, on, guadalupe, island, it, has, since, recolonized, much, of, its, historic, range, but, has, a, population, bottleneck, conversely, the, mediterranean, monk, seal, was, extirpated, from, much, of, the, mediterranean, and, its, current, range, is, still, limited, several, species, of, pinniped, continue, to, be, exploited, the, convention, for, the, conservation, of, antarctic, seals, protects, species, within, the, antarctic, and, surrounding, waters, but, allows, restricted, hunting, of, crabeater, seals, leopard, seals, and, weddell, seals, weddell, seal, hunting, is, forbidden, between, september, and, february, if, the, animal, is, older, than, a, year, to, ensure, healthy, population, growth, the, government, of, canada, permits, the, hunting, of, harp, seals, this, has, been, met, with, controversy, and, debate, proponents, of, seal, hunts, insist, that, the, animals, are, killed, humanely, and, the, white, coated, pups, are, not, taken, while, opponents, argue, that, it, is, irresponsible, to, kill, harp, seals, as, they, are, already, threatened, by, declining, habitat, the, caribbean, monk, seal, has, been, killed, and, exploited, by, european, settlers, and, their, descendants, since, 1494, starting, with, christopher, columbus, himself, the, seals, were, easy, targets, for, organized, sealers, fishermen, turtle, hunters, and, buccaneers, because, they, evolved, with, little, pressure, from, terrestrial, predators, and, were, thus, genetically, tame, in, the, bahamas, as, many, as, 100, seals, were, slaughtered, in, one, night, the, species, was, considered, to, be, already, extinct, by, the, mid, nineteenth, century, until, a, small, colony, was, found, near, the, yucat, n, peninsula, in, 1866, seal, killings, continued, and, the, last, reliable, report, of, the, animal, alive, was, in, 1952, at, serranilla, bank, the, iucn, declared, it, extinct, in, 1996, the, japanese, sea, lion, was, common, around, the, japanese, islands, but, overexploitation, and, competition, from, fisheries, drastically, decreased, the, population, in, the, 1930s, the, last, recorded, individual, was, a, juvenile, in, 1974, as, of, 2021, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, recognizes, 36, pinniped, species, with, the, japanese, sea, lion, and, the, caribbean, monk, seal, recently, extinct, ten, more, are, considered, at, risk, they, are, ranked, as, pinnipeds, face, various, threats, they, are, unintentionally, caught, in, fishing, nets, by, commercial, fisheries, and, accidentally, swallow, fishing, hooks, gillnetting, and, seine, netting, is, a, significant, cause, of, mortality, in, seals, and, other, marine, mammals, species, commonly, entangled, include, california, sea, lions, hawaiian, monk, seals, northern, fur, seals, and, brown, fur, seals, pinnipeds, are, also, affected, by, marine, pollution, organic, chemicals, tend, to, accumulate, in, these, animals, since, they, are, high, in, the, food, chain, and, have, large, reserves, of, blubber, lactating, mothers, can, pass, the, toxins, on, to, their, young, these, pollutants, can, cause, gastrointestinal, cancers, and, decreased, fertility, and, immunity, to, infectious, diseases, other, man, made, threats, include, habitat, destruction, by, oil, and, gas, exploitation, encroachment, by, boats, and, underwater, noise, species, that, live, in, polar, habitats, are, vulnerable, to, the, effects, of, climate, change, on, oceans, particularly, declines, in, sea, ice, in, 2010, and, 2011, sea, ice, in, the, northwest, atlantic, was, at, or, near, an, all, time, low, and, harp, seals, as, well, as, ringed, seals, that, bred, on, thin, ice, saw, increased, death, rates, in, the, antarctic, the, decreased, duration, and, extent, of, the, sea, ice, and, nutrient, availability, could, potentially, reduce, the, survival, of, weddell, seal, pups, and, may, have, important, implications, for, population, growth, rates, antarctic, fur, seals, in, south, georgia, in, the, south, atlantic, saw, major, decreases, over, a, 20, year, study, during, which, scientists, measured, increased, sea, surface, temperature, anomalies, some, species, have, become, so, numerous, that, they, conflict, with, local, people, in, the, united, states, pinnipeds, are, protected, under, the, marine, mammal, protection, act, of, 1972, mmpa, since, that, year, california, sea, lion, populations, have, risen, to, 250, 000, these, animals, began, exploiting, more, man, made, environments, like, docks, for, haul, out, sites, many, docks, are, not, designed, to, withstand, the, weight, of, several, resting, sea, lions, wildlife, managers, have, used, various, methods, to, control, the, animals, and, some, city, officials, have, redesigned, docks, so, they, can, better, resist, sea, lion, use, inland, living, new, zealand, sea, lions, face, unique, human, conflicts, such, as, road, mortality, and, run, ins, with, human, infrastructure, seals, also, conflict, with, fisherman, in, 2007, mmpa, was, amended, to, permit, the, lethal, removal, of, sea, lions, from, salmon, runs, at, bonneville, dam, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, south, african, politicians, and, fishermen, demanded, that, brown, fur, seals, be, culled, believing, that, the, animals, competed, with, commercial, fisheries, scientific, studies, found, that, culling, fur, seals, would, actually, have, a, negative, effect, on, the, fishing, industry, and, the, culling, option, was, dropped, in, 1993
