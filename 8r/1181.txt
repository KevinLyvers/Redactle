salmonella, is, a, genus, of, rod, shaped, bacillus, gram, negative, bacteria, of, the, family, enterobacteriaceae, the, two, known, species, of, salmonella, are, salmonella, enterica, and, salmonella, bongori, s, enterica, is, the, type, species, and, is, further, divided, into, six, subspecies, that, include, over, 2, 650, serotypes, salmonella, was, named, after, daniel, elmer, salmon, 1850, 1914, an, american, veterinary, surgeon, salmonella, species, are, non, spore, forming, predominantly, motile, enterobacteria, with, cell, diameters, between, about, 0, 7, and, 1, 5, m, lengths, from, 2, to, 5, m, and, peritrichous, flagella, all, around, the, cell, body, allowing, them, to, move, they, are, chemotrophs, obtaining, their, energy, from, oxidation, and, reduction, reactions, using, organic, sources, they, are, also, facultative, anaerobes, capable, of, generating, adenosine, triphosphate, with, oxygen, aerobically, when, it, is, available, or, using, other, electron, acceptors, or, fermentation, anaerobically, when, oxygen, is, not, available, salmonella, species, are, intracellular, pathogens, of, which, certain, serotypes, cause, illness, such, as, salmonellosis, most, infections, are, due, to, the, ingestion, of, food, contaminated, by, feces, typhoidal, salmonella, serotypes, can, only, be, transferred, between, humans, and, can, cause, foodborne, illness, as, well, as, typhoid, and, paratyphoid, fever, typhoid, fever, is, caused, by, typhoidal, salmonella, invading, the, bloodstream, as, well, as, spreading, throughout, the, body, invading, organs, and, secreting, endotoxins, the, septic, form, this, can, lead, to, life, threatening, hypovolemic, shock, and, septic, shock, and, requires, intensive, care, including, antibiotics, nontyphoidal, salmonella, serotypes, are, zoonotic, and, can, be, transferred, from, animals, and, between, humans, they, usually, invade, only, the, gastrointestinal, tract, and, cause, salmonellosis, the, symptoms, of, which, can, be, resolved, without, antibiotics, however, in, sub, saharan, africa, nontyphoidal, salmonella, can, be, invasive, and, cause, paratyphoid, fever, which, requires, immediate, antibiotic, treatment, the, genus, salmonella, is, part, of, the, family, of, enterobacteriaceae, its, taxonomy, has, been, revised, and, has, the, potential, to, confuse, the, genus, comprises, two, species, s, bongori, and, s, enterica, the, latter, of, which, is, divided, into, six, subspecies, s, e, enterica, s, e, salamae, s, e, arizonae, s, e, diarizonae, s, e, houtenae, and, s, e, indica, the, taxonomic, group, contains, more, than, 2500, serotypes, also, serovars, defined, on, the, basis, of, the, somatic, o, lipopolysaccharide, and, flagellar, h, antigens, the, kauffman, white, classification, the, full, name, of, a, serotype, is, given, as, for, example, salmonella, enterica, subsp, enterica, serotype, typhimurium, but, can, be, abbreviated, to, salmonella, typhimurium, further, differentiation, of, strains, to, assist, clinical, and, epidemiological, investigation, may, be, achieved, by, antibiotic, sensitivity, testing, and, by, other, molecular, biology, techniques, such, as, pulsed, field, gel, electrophoresis, multilocus, sequence, typing, and, increasingly, whole, genome, sequencing, historically, salmonellae, have, been, clinically, categorized, as, invasive, typhoidal, or, noninvasive, nontyphoidal, salmonellae, based, on, host, preference, and, disease, manifestations, in, humans, salmonella, was, first, visualized, in, 1880, by, karl, eberth, in, the, peyer, s, patches, and, spleens, of, typhoid, patients, four, years, later, georg, theodor, gaffky, was, able, to, grow, the, pathogen, in, pure, culture, a, year, after, that, medical, research, scientist, theobald, smith, discovered, what, would, be, later, known, as, salmonella, enterica, var, choleraesuis, at, the, time, smith, was, working, as, a, research, laboratory, assistant, in, the, veterinary, division, of, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, the, division, was, under, the, administration, of, daniel, elmer, salmon, a, veterinary, pathologist, initially, salmonella, choleraesuis, was, thought, to, be, the, causative, agent, of, hog, cholera, so, salmon, and, smith, named, it, hog, cholera, bacillus, the, name, salmonella, was, not, used, until, 1900, when, joseph, leon, ligni, res, proposed, that, the, pathogen, discovered, by, salmon, s, group, be, called, salmonella, in, his, honor, 16, in, the, late, 1930s, australian, bacteriologist, nancy, atkinson, established, a, salmonella, typing, laboratory, one, of, only, three, in, the, world, at, the, time, at, the, government, of, south, australia, s, laboratory, of, pathology, and, bacteriology, in, adelaide, later, the, institute, of, medical, and, veterinary, science, it, was, here, that, atkinson, described, multiple, new, strains, of, salmonella, including, salmonella, adelaide, which, was, isolated, in, 1943, atkinson, published, her, work, on, salmonellas, in, 1957, serotyping, is, done, by, mixing, cells, with, antibodies, for, a, particular, antigen, it, can, give, some, idea, about, risk, a, 2014, study, showed, that, s, reading, is, very, common, among, young, turkey, samples, but, it, is, not, a, significant, contributor, to, human, salmonellosis, serotyping, can, assist, in, identifying, the, source, of, contamination, by, matching, serotypes, in, people, with, serotypes, in, the, suspected, source, of, infection, appropriate, prophylactic, treatment, can, be, identified, from, the, known, antibiotic, resistance, of, the, serotype, newer, methods, of, serotyping, include, xmap, and, real, time, pcr, two, methods, based, on, dna, sequences, instead, of, antibody, reactions, these, methods, can, be, potentially, faster, thanks, to, advances, in, sequencing, technology, these, molecular, serotyping, systems, actually, perform, genotyping, of, the, genes, that, determine, surface, antigens, most, subspecies, of, salmonella, produce, hydrogen, sulfide, which, can, readily, be, detected, by, growing, them, on, media, containing, ferrous, sulfate, such, as, is, used, in, the, triple, sugar, iron, test, most, isolates, exist, in, two, phases, a, motile, phase, and, a, non, motile, phase, cultures, that, are, nonmotile, upon, primary, culture, may, be, switched, to, the, motile, phase, using, a, craigie, tube, or, ditch, plate, rvs, broth, can, be, used, to, enrich, for, salmonella, species, for, detection, in, a, clinical, sample, salmonella, can, also, be, detected, and, subtyped, using, multiplex, or, real, time, polymerase, chain, reaction, qpcr, from, extracted, salmonella, dna, mathematical, models, of, salmonella, growth, kinetics, have, been, developed, for, chicken, pork, tomatoes, and, melons, salmonella, reproduce, asexually, with, a, cell, division, interval, of, 40, minutes, salmonella, species, lead, predominantly, host, associated, lifestyles, but, the, bacteria, were, found, to, be, able, to, persist, in, a, bathroom, setting, for, weeks, following, contamination, and, are, frequently, isolated, from, water, sources, which, act, as, bacterial, reservoirs, and, may, help, to, facilitate, transmission, between, hosts, salmonella, is, notorious, for, its, ability, to, survive, desiccation, and, can, persist, for, years, in, dry, environments, and, foods, the, bacteria, are, not, destroyed, by, freezing, but, uv, light, and, heat, accelerate, their, destruction, they, perish, after, being, heated, to, 55, c, 131, f, for, 90, min, or, to, 60, c, 140, f, for, 12, min, although, if, inoculated, in, high, fat, high, liquid, substances, like, peanut, butter, they, gain, heat, resistance, and, can, survive, up, to, 90, c, 194, f, for, 30, min, to, protect, against, salmonella, infection, heating, food, to, an, internal, temperature, of, 75, c, 167, f, is, recommended, salmonella, species, can, be, found, in, the, digestive, tracts, of, humans, and, animals, especially, reptiles, salmonella, on, the, skin, of, reptiles, or, amphibians, can, be, passed, to, people, who, handle, the, animals, food, and, water, can, also, be, contaminated, with, the, bacteria, if, they, come, in, contact, with, the, feces, of, infected, people, or, animals, initially, each, salmonella, species, was, named, according, to, clinical, consideration, for, example, salmonella, typhi, murium, mouse, typhoid, s, cholerae, suis, pig, cholera, after, host, specificity, was, recognized, not, to, exist, for, many, species, new, strains, received, species, names, according, to, the, location, at, which, the, new, strain, was, isolated, in, 1987, le, minor, and, popoff, used, molecular, findings, to, argue, that, salmonella, consisted, of, only, one, species, s, enterica, turning, former, species, names, into, serotypes, in, 1989, reeves, et, al, proposed, that, the, serotype, v, should, remain, its, own, species, resurrecting, the, name, s, bongori, the, current, by, 2005, nomenclature, has, thus, taken, shape, with, six, recognised, subspecies, under, s, enterica, enterica, serotype, i, salamae, serotype, ii, arizonae, iiia, diarizonae, iiib, houtenae, iv, and, indica, vi, as, specialists, in, infectious, disease, are, not, familiar, with, the, new, nomenclature, the, traditional, nomenclature, remains, common, the, serotype, or, serovar, is, a, classification, of, salmonella, based, on, antigens, that, the, organism, presents, the, kauffman, white, classification, scheme, differentiates, serological, varieties, from, each, other, serotypes, are, usually, put, into, subspecies, groups, after, the, genus, and, species, with, the, serotypes, serovars, capitalized, but, not, italicized, an, example, is, salmonella, enterica, serovar, typhimurium, more, modern, approaches, for, typing, and, subtyping, salmonella, include, dna, based, methods, such, as, pulsed, field, gel, electrophoresis, multiple, loci, vntr, analysis, multilocus, sequence, typing, and, multiplex, pcr, based, methods, in, 2005, a, third, species, salmonella, subterranea, was, proposed, but, according, to, the, world, health, organization, the, bacterium, reported, does, not, belong, in, the, genus, salmonella, in, 2016, s, subterranea, was, proposed, to, be, assigned, to, atlantibacter, subterranea, but, lpsn, rejects, it, as, an, invalid, publication, as, it, was, made, outside, of, ijsb, and, ijsem, gtdb, and, ncbi, agree, with, the, 2016, reassignment, gtdb, rs202, reports, that, s, arizonae, s, diarizonae, and, s, houtenae, should, be, species, of, their, own, salmonella, species, are, facultative, intracellular, pathogens, salmonella, can, invade, different, cell, types, including, epithelial, cells, m, cells, macrophages, and, dendritic, cells, as, facultative, anaerobic, organism, salmonella, uses, oxygen, to, make, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, in, aerobic, environments, i, e, when, oxygen, is, available, however, in, anaerobic, environments, i, e, when, oxygen, is, not, available, salmonella, produces, atp, by, fermentation, that, is, by, substituting, instead, of, oxygen, at, least, one, of, four, electron, acceptors, at, the, end, of, the, electron, transport, chain, sulfate, nitrate, sulfur, or, fumarate, all, of, which, are, less, efficient, than, oxygen, most, infections, are, due, to, ingestion, of, food, contaminated, by, animal, feces, or, by, human, feces, for, example, from, the, hands, of, a, food, service, worker, at, a, commercial, eatery, salmonella, serotypes, can, be, divided, into, two, main, groups, typhoidal, and, nontyphoidal, typhoidal, serotypes, include, salmonella, typhi, and, salmonella, paratyphi, a, which, are, adapted, to, humans, and, do, not, occur, in, other, animals, nontyphoidal, serotypes, are, more, common, and, usually, cause, self, limiting, gastrointestinal, disease, they, can, infect, a, range, of, animals, and, are, zoonotic, meaning, they, can, be, transferred, between, humans, and, other, animals, salmonella, pathogenicity, and, host, interaction, has, been, studied, extensively, since, the, 2010s, most, of, the, important, virulent, genes, of, salmonella, are, encoded, in, five, pathogenicity, islands, the, so, called, salmonella, pathogenicity, islands, spis, these, are, chromosomal, encoded, and, make, a, significant, contribution, to, bacterial, host, interaction, more, traits, like, plasmids, flagella, or, biofilm, related, proteins, can, contribute, in, the, infection, spis, are, regulated, by, complex, and, fine, tuned, regulatory, networks, that, allow, the, gene, expression, only, in, the, presence, of, the, right, environmental, stresses, molecular, modeling, and, active, site, analysis, of, sdia, homolog, a, putative, quorum, sensor, for, salmonella, typhimurium, pathogenicity, reveals, the, specific, binding, patterns, of, ahl, transcriptional, regulators, it, is, also, known, that, salmonella, plasmid, virulence, gene, spvb, enhances, bacterial, virulence, by, inhibiting, autophagy, typhoid, fever, is, caused, by, salmonella, serotypes, which, are, strictly, adapted, to, humans, or, higher, primates, these, include, salmonella, typhi, paratyphi, a, paratyphi, b, and, paratyphi, c, in, the, systemic, form, of, the, disease, salmonellae, pass, through, the, lymphatic, system, of, the, intestine, into, the, blood, of, the, patients, typhoid, form, and, are, carried, to, various, organs, liver, spleen, kidneys, to, form, secondary, foci, septic, form, endotoxins, first, act, on, the, vascular, and, nervous, apparatus, resulting, in, increased, permeability, and, decreased, tone, of, the, vessels, upset, of, thermal, regulation, and, vomiting, and, diarrhoea, in, severe, forms, of, the, disease, enough, liquid, and, electrolytes, are, lost, to, upset, the, water, salt, metabolism, decrease, the, circulating, blood, volume, and, arterial, pressure, and, cause, hypovolemic, shock, septic, shock, may, also, develop, shock, of, mixed, character, with, signs, of, both, hypovolemic, and, septic, shock, is, more, common, in, severe, salmonellosis, oliguria, and, azotemia, may, develop, in, severe, cases, as, a, result, of, renal, involvement, due, to, hypoxia, and, toxemia, infection, with, nontyphoidal, serotypes, of, salmonella, generally, results, in, food, poisoning, infection, usually, occurs, when, a, person, ingests, foods, that, contain, a, high, concentration, of, the, bacteria, infants, and, young, children, are, much, more, susceptible, to, infection, easily, achieved, by, ingesting, a, small, number, of, bacteria, in, infants, infection, through, inhalation, of, bacteria, laden, dust, is, possible, the, organisms, enter, through, the, digestive, tract, and, must, be, ingested, in, large, numbers, to, cause, disease, in, healthy, adults, an, infection, can, only, begin, after, living, salmonellae, not, merely, salmonella, produced, toxins, reach, the, gastrointestinal, tract, some, of, the, microorganisms, are, killed, in, the, stomach, while, the, surviving, ones, enter, the, small, intestine, and, multiply, in, tissues, gastric, acidity, is, responsible, for, the, destruction, of, the, majority, of, ingested, bacteria, but, salmonella, has, evolved, a, degree, of, tolerance, to, acidic, environments, that, allows, a, subset, of, ingested, bacteria, to, survive, bacterial, colonies, may, also, become, trapped, in, mucus, produced, in, the, esophagus, by, the, end, of, the, incubation, period, the, nearby, host, cells, are, poisoned, by, endotoxins, released, from, the, dead, salmonellae, the, local, response, to, the, endotoxins, is, enteritis, and, gastrointestinal, disorder, about, 2, 000, serotypes, of, nontyphoidal, salmonella, are, known, which, may, be, responsible, for, as, many, as, 1, 4, million, illnesses, in, the, united, states, each, year, people, who, are, at, risk, for, severe, illness, include, infants, elderly, organ, transplant, recipients, and, the, immunocompromised, while, in, developed, countries, nontyphoidal, serotypes, present, mostly, as, gastrointestinal, disease, in, sub, saharan, africa, these, serotypes, can, create, a, major, problem, in, bloodstream, infections, and, are, the, most, commonly, isolated, bacteria, from, the, blood, of, those, presenting, with, fever, bloodstream, infections, caused, by, nontyphoidal, salmonellae, in, africa, were, reported, in, 2012, to, have, a, case, fatality, rate, of, 20, 25, most, cases, of, invasive, nontyphoidal, salmonella, infection, ints, are, caused, by, salmonella, enterica, typhimurium, or, salmonella, enterica, enteritidis, a, new, form, of, salmonella, typhimurium, st313, emerged, in, the, southeast, of, the, african, continent, 75, years, ago, followed, by, a, second, wave, which, came, out, of, central, africa, 18, years, later, this, second, wave, of, ints, possibly, originated, in, the, congo, basin, and, early, in, the, event, picked, up, a, gene, that, made, it, resistant, to, the, antibiotic, chloramphenicol, this, created, the, need, to, use, expensive, antimicrobial, drugs, in, areas, of, africa, that, were, very, poor, making, treatment, difficult, the, increased, prevalence, of, ints, in, sub, saharan, africa, compared, to, other, regions, is, thought, to, be, due, to, the, large, proportion, of, the, african, population, with, some, degree, of, immune, suppression, or, impairment, due, to, the, burden, of, hiv, malaria, and, malnutrition, especially, in, children, the, genetic, makeup, of, ints, is, evolving, into, a, more, typhoid, like, bacterium, able, to, efficiently, spread, around, the, human, body, symptoms, are, reported, to, be, diverse, including, fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and, respiratory, symptoms, often, with, an, absence, of, gastrointestinal, symptoms, due, to, being, considered, sporadic, between, 60, and, 80, of, salmonella, infections, cases, go, undiagnosed, in, march, 2010, data, analysis, was, completed, to, estimate, an, incidence, rate, of, 1140, per, 100, 000, person, years, in, the, same, analysis, 93, 8, million, cases, of, gastroenteritis, were, due, to, salmonella, infections, at, the, 5th, percentile, the, estimated, amount, was, 61, 8, million, cases, and, at, the, 95th, percentile, the, estimated, amount, was, 131, 6, million, cases, the, estimated, number, of, deaths, due, to, salmonella, was, approximately, 155, 000, deaths, in, 2014, in, countries, such, as, bulgaria, and, portugal, children, under, 4, were, 32, and, 82, times, more, likely, respectively, to, have, a, salmonella, infection, those, who, are, most, susceptible, to, infection, are, children, pregnant, women, elderly, people, and, those, with, deficient, immune, systems, risk, factors, for, salmonella, infections, include, a, variety, of, foods, meats, such, as, chicken, and, pork, have, the, possibility, to, be, contaminated, a, variety, of, vegetables, and, sprouts, may, also, have, salmonella, lastly, a, variety, of, processed, foods, such, as, chicken, nuggets, and, pot, pies, may, also, contain, this, bacteria, successful, forms, of, prevention, come, from, existing, entities, such, as, the, fda, united, states, department, of, agriculture, and, the, food, safety, and, inspection, service, all, of, these, organizations, create, standards, and, inspections, to, ensure, public, safety, in, the, u, s, for, example, the, fsis, agency, working, with, the, usda, has, a, salmonella, action, plan, in, place, recently, it, received, a, two, year, plan, update, in, february, 2016, their, accomplishments, and, strategies, to, reduce, salmonella, infection, are, presented, in, the, plans, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, also, provides, valuable, information, on, preventative, care, such, has, how, to, safely, handle, raw, foods, and, the, correct, way, to, store, these, products, in, the, european, union, the, european, food, safety, authority, created, preventative, measures, through, risk, management, and, risk, assessment, from, 2005, to, 2009, the, efsa, placed, an, approach, to, reduce, exposure, to, salmonella, their, approach, included, risk, assessment, and, risk, management, of, poultry, which, resulted, in, a, reduction, of, infection, cases, by, one, half, in, latin, america, an, orally, administered, vaccine, for, salmonella, in, poultry, developed, by, dr, sherry, layton, has, been, introduced, which, prevents, the, bacteria, from, contaminating, the, birds, a, recent, salmonella, typhimurium, outbreak, has, been, linked, to, chocolate, in, germany, food, borne, infections, must, be, reported, from, 1990, to, 2016, the, number, of, officially, recorded, cases, decreased, from, about, 200, 000, to, about, 13, 000, cases, in, the, united, states, about, 1, 200, 000, cases, of, salmonella, infection, are, estimated, to, occur, each, year, a, world, health, organization, study, estimated, that, 21, 650, 974, cases, of, typhoid, fever, occurred, in, 2000, 216, 510, of, which, resulted, in, death, along, with, 5, 412, 744, cases, of, paratyphoid, fever, the, mechanisms, of, infection, differ, between, typhoidal, and, nontyphoidal, serotypes, owing, to, their, different, targets, in, the, body, and, the, different, symptoms, that, they, cause, both, groups, must, enter, by, crossing, the, barrier, created, by, the, intestinal, cell, wall, but, once, they, have, passed, this, barrier, they, use, different, strategies, to, cause, infection, while, travelling, to, their, target, tissue, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, salmonella, is, exposed, to, stomach, acid, to, the, detergent, like, activity, of, bile, in, the, intestine, to, decreasing, oxygen, supply, to, the, competing, normal, gut, flora, and, finally, to, antimicrobial, peptides, present, on, the, surface, of, the, cells, lining, the, intestinal, wall, all, of, these, form, stresses, that, salmonella, can, sense, and, reacts, against, and, they, form, virulence, factors, and, as, such, regulate, the, switch, from, their, normal, growth, in, the, intestine, into, virulence, the, switch, to, virulence, gives, access, to, a, replication, niche, inside, the, host, such, as, humans, and, can, be, summarised, into, several, stages, nontyphoidal, serotypes, preferentially, enter, m, cells, on, the, intestinal, wall, by, bacterial, mediated, endocytosis, a, process, associated, with, intestinal, inflammation, and, diarrhoea, they, are, also, able, to, disrupt, tight, junctions, between, the, cells, of, the, intestinal, wall, impairing, the, cells, ability, to, stop, the, flow, of, ions, water, and, immune, cells, into, and, out, of, the, intestine, the, combination, of, the, inflammation, caused, by, bacterial, mediated, endocytosis, and, the, disruption, of, tight, junctions, is, thought, to, contribute, significantly, to, the, induction, of, diarrhoea, salmonellae, are, also, able, to, breach, the, intestinal, barrier, via, phagocytosis, and, trafficking, by, cd18, positive, immune, cells, which, may, be, a, mechanism, key, to, typhoidal, salmonella, infection, this, is, thought, to, be, a, more, stealthy, way, of, passing, the, intestinal, barrier, and, may, therefore, contribute, to, the, fact, that, lower, numbers, of, typhoidal, salmonella, are, required, for, infection, than, nontyphoidal, salmonella, salmonella, cells, are, able, to, enter, macrophages, via, macropinocytosis, typhoidal, serotypes, can, use, this, to, achieve, dissemination, throughout, the, body, via, the, mononuclear, phagocyte, system, a, network, of, connective, tissue, that, contains, immune, cells, and, surrounds, tissue, associated, with, the, immune, system, throughout, the, body, much, of, the, success, of, salmonella, in, causing, infection, is, attributed, to, two, type, iii, secretion, systems, t3ss, which, are, expressed, at, different, times, during, the, infection, the, t3ss, 1, enables, the, injection, of, bacterial, effectors, within, the, host, cytosol, these, t3ss, 1, effectors, stimulate, the, formation, of, membrane, ruffles, allowing, the, uptake, of, salmonella, by, nonphagocytic, cells, salmonella, further, resides, within, a, membrane, bound, compartment, called, the, salmonella, containing, vacuole, scv, the, acidification, of, the, scv, leads, to, the, expression, of, the, t3ss, 2, the, secretion, of, t3ss, 2, effectors, by, salmonella, is, required, for, its, efficient, survival, in, the, host, cytosol, and, establishment, of, systemic, disease, in, addition, both, t3ss, are, involved, in, the, colonization, of, the, intestine, induction, of, intestinal, inflammatory, responses, and, diarrhea, these, systems, contain, many, genes, which, must, work, cooperatively, to, achieve, infection, the, avra, toxin, injected, by, the, spi1, type, iii, secretion, system, of, s, typhimurium, works, to, inhibit, the, innate, immune, system, by, virtue, of, its, serine, threonine, acetyltransferase, activity, and, requires, binding, to, eukaryotic, target, cell, phytic, acid, ip6, this, leaves, the, host, more, susceptible, to, infection, salmonellosis, is, known, to, be, able, to, cause, back, pain, or, spondylosis, it, can, manifest, as, five, clinical, patterns, gastrointestinal, tract, infection, enteric, fever, bacteremia, local, infection, and, the, chronic, reservoir, state, the, initial, symptoms, are, nonspecific, fever, weakness, and, myalgia, among, others, in, the, bacteremia, state, it, can, spread, to, any, parts, of, the, body, and, this, induces, localized, infection, or, it, forms, abscesses, the, forms, of, localized, salmonella, infections, are, arthritis, urinary, tract, infection, infection, of, the, central, nervous, system, bone, infection, soft, tissue, infection, etc, infection, may, remain, as, the, latent, form, for, a, long, time, and, when, the, function, of, reticular, endothelial, cells, is, deteriorated, it, may, become, activated, and, consequently, it, may, secondarily, induce, spreading, infection, in, the, bone, several, months, or, several, years, after, acute, salmonellosis, a, 2018, imperial, college, london, study, also, shows, how, salmonella, disrupt, specific, arms, of, the, immune, system, e, g, 3, of, 5, nf, kappab, proteins, using, a, family, of, zinc, metalloproteinase, effectors, leaving, others, untouched, salmonella, thyroid, abscess, has, also, been, reported, a, hallmark, of, salmonella, pathogenesis, is, the, ability, of, the, bacterium, to, survive, and, proliferate, within, phagocytes, phagocytes, produce, dna, damaging, agents, such, as, nitric, oxide, and, oxygen, radicals, as, a, defense, against, pathogens, thus, salmonella, species, must, face, attack, by, molecules, that, challenge, genome, integrity, buchmeier, et, al, showed, that, mutants, of, s, enterica, lacking, reca, or, recbc, protein, function, are, highly, sensitive, to, oxidative, compounds, synthesized, by, macrophages, and, furthermore, these, findings, indicate, that, successful, systemic, infection, by, s, enterica, requires, reca, and, recbc, mediated, recombinational, repair, of, dna, damage, s, enterica, through, some, of, its, serotypes, such, as, typhimurium, and, enteritidis, shows, signs, that, it, has, the, ability, to, infect, several, different, mammalian, host, species, while, other, serotypes, such, as, typhi, seem, to, be, restricted, to, only, a, few, hosts, two, ways, that, salmonella, serotypes, have, adapted, to, their, hosts, are, by, the, loss, of, genetic, material, and, mutation, in, more, complex, mammalian, species, immune, systems, which, include, pathogen, specific, immune, responses, target, serovars, of, salmonella, by, binding, antibodies, to, structures, such, as, flagella, thus, salmonella, that, has, lost, the, genetic, material, which, codes, for, a, flagellum, to, form, can, evade, a, host, s, immune, system, mgtc, leader, rna, from, bacteria, virulence, gene, mgtcbr, operon, decreases, flagellin, production, during, infection, by, directly, base, pairing, with, mrnas, of, the, fljb, gene, encoding, flagellin, and, promotes, degradation, in, the, study, by, kisela, et, al, more, pathogenic, serovars, of, s, enterica, were, found, to, have, certain, adhesins, in, common, that, have, developed, out, of, convergent, evolution, this, means, that, as, these, strains, of, salmonella, have, been, exposed, to, similar, conditions, such, as, immune, systems, similar, structures, evolved, separately, to, negate, these, similar, more, advanced, defenses, in, hosts, although, many, questions, remain, about, how, salmonella, has, evolved, into, so, many, different, types, salmonella, may, have, evolved, through, several, phases, for, example, as, baumler, et, al, have, suggested, salmonella, most, likely, evolved, through, horizontal, gene, transfer, and, through, the, formation, of, new, serovars, due, to, additional, pathogenicity, islands, and, through, an, approximation, of, its, ancestry, so, salmonella, could, have, evolved, into, its, many, different, serotypes, by, gaining, genetic, information, from, different, pathogenic, bacteria, the, presence, of, several, pathogenicity, islands, in, the, genome, of, different, serotypes, has, lent, credence, to, this, theory, salmonella, sv, newport, shows, signs, of, adaptation, to, a, plant, colonization, lifestyle, which, may, play, a, role, in, its, disproportionate, association, with, food, borne, illness, linked, to, produce, a, variety, of, functions, selected, for, during, sv, newport, persistence, in, tomatoes, have, been, reported, to, be, similar, to, those, selected, for, in, sv, typhimurium, from, animal, hosts, the, papa, gene, which, is, unique, to, sv, newport, contributes, to, the, strain, s, fitness, in, tomatoes, and, has, homologs, in, the, genomes, of, other, enterobacteriaceae, that, are, able, to, colonize, plant, and, animal, hosts, in, addition, to, their, importance, as, pathogens, nontyphoidal, salmonella, species, such, as, s, enterica, serovar, typhimurium, are, commonly, used, as, homologues, of, typhoid, species, many, findings, are, transferable, and, it, attenuates, the, danger, for, the, researcher, in, case, of, contamination, but, is, also, limited, for, example, it, is, not, possible, to, study, specific, typhoidal, toxins, using, this, model, however, strong, research, tools, such, as, the, commonly, used, mouse, intestine, gastroenteritis, model, build, upon, the, use, of, salmonella, typhimurium, for, genetics, s, typhimurium, has, been, instrumental, in, the, development, of, genetic, tools, that, led, to, an, understanding, of, fundamental, bacterial, physiology, these, developments, were, enabled, by, the, discovery, of, the, first, generalized, transducing, phage, p22, in, s, typhimurium, that, allowed, quick, and, easy, genetic, editing, in, turn, this, made, fine, structure, genetic, analysis, possible, the, large, number, of, mutants, led, to, a, revision, of, genetic, nomenclature, for, bacteria, many, of, the, uses, of, transposons, as, genetic, tools, including, transposon, delivery, mutagenesis, and, construction, of, chromosome, rearrangements, were, also, developed, in, s, typhimurium, these, genetic, tools, also, led, to, a, simple, test, for, carcinogens, the, ames, test, as, a, natural, alternative, to, traditional, antimicrobials, phages, are, being, recognised, as, highly, effective, control, agents, for, salmonella, and, other, foodborne, bacteria, s, enterica, genomes, have, been, reconstructed, from, up, to, 6, 500, year, old, human, remains, across, western, eurasia, which, provides, evidence, for, geographic, widespread, infections, with, systemic, s, enterica, during, prehistory, and, a, possible, role, of, the, neolithization, process, in, the, evolution, of, host, adaptation, additional, reconstructed, genomes, from, colonial, mexico, suggest, s, enterica, as, the, cause, of, cocoliztli, an, epidemic, in, 16th, century, new, spain
