nearly, 30, see, text, starlings, are, small, to, medium, sized, passerine, birds, in, the, family, sturnidae, common, name, of, sturnid, the, sturnidae, are, named, for, the, genus, sturnus, which, in, turn, comes, from, the, latin, word, for, starling, sturnus, the, family, contains, 128, species, which, are, divided, into, 36, genera, many, asian, species, particularly, the, larger, ones, are, called, mynas, and, many, african, species, are, known, as, glossy, starlings, because, of, their, iridescent, plumage, starlings, are, native, to, europe, asia, and, africa, as, well, as, northern, australia, and, the, islands, of, the, tropical, pacific, several, european, and, asian, species, have, been, introduced, to, these, areas, as, well, as, north, america, hawaii, and, new, zealand, where, they, generally, compete, for, habitats, with, native, birds, and, are, considered, to, be, invasive, species, the, starling, species, familiar, to, most, people, in, europe, and, north, america, is, the, common, starling, and, throughout, much, of, asia, and, the, pacific, the, common, myna, is, indeed, common, starlings, have, strong, feet, their, flight, is, strong, and, direct, and, they, are, very, gregarious, their, preferred, habitat, is, fairly, open, country, and, they, eat, insects, and, fruit, several, species, live, around, human, habitation, and, are, effectively, omnivores, many, species, search, for, prey, such, as, grubs, by, open, bill, probing, that, is, forcefully, opening, the, bill, after, inserting, it, into, a, crevice, thus, expanding, the, hole, and, exposing, the, prey, this, behaviour, is, referred, to, by, the, german, verb, zirkeln, pronounced, plumage, of, many, species, is, typically, dark, with, a, metallic, sheen, most, species, nest, in, holes, and, lay, blue, or, white, eggs, starlings, have, diverse, and, complex, vocalizations, and, have, been, known, to, embed, sounds, from, their, surroundings, into, their, own, calls, including, car, alarms, and, human, speech, patterns, the, birds, can, recognize, particular, individuals, by, their, calls, and, are, the, subject, of, research, into, the, evolution, of, human, language, starlings, are, medium, sized, passerines, the, shortest, bodied, species, is, kenrick, s, starling, poeoptera, kenricki, at, 15, cm, 6, in, but, the, lightest, weight, species, is, abbott, s, starling, poeoptera, femoralis, which, is, 34, g, 1, 1, 4, oz, the, largest, starling, going, on, standard, measurements, and, perhaps, weight, is, the, nias, hill, myna, gracula, robusta, this, species, can, measure, up, to, 36, cm, 14, in, and, in, domestication, they, can, weigh, up, to, 400, g, 14, oz, rivaling, the, prior, species, in, bulk, if, not, dimensions, the, mynas, of, the, genus, mino, are, also, large, especially, the, yellow, faced, m, dumontii, and, long, tailed, mynas, m, kreffti, the, longest, species, in, the, family, is, the, white, necked, myna, streptocitta, albicollis, which, can, measure, up, to, 50, cm, 19, 1, 2, in, although, around, 60, in, this, magpie, like, species, is, comprised, by, its, very, long, tail, less, sexual, dimorphism, is, seen, in, plumage, but, with, only, 25, species, showing, such, differences, between, the, two, sexes, the, plumage, of, the, starling, is, often, brightly, coloured, due, to, iridescence, this, colour, is, derived, from, the, structure, of, the, feathers, not, from, any, pigment, some, species, of, asian, starling, have, crests, or, erectile, feathers, on, the, crest, other, ornamentation, includes, elongated, tail, feathers, and, brightly, coloured, bare, areas, on, the, face, these, colours, can, be, derived, from, pigments, or, as, in, the, bali, myna, structural, colour, caused, by, light, scattering, off, parallel, collagen, fibers, the, irises, of, many, species, are, red, and, yellow, although, those, of, younger, birds, are, much, darker, starlings, inhabit, a, wide, range, of, habitats, from, the, arctic, circle, to, the, equator, the, only, habitats, they, do, not, typically, occupy, are, very, dry, sandy, deserts, the, family, is, naturally, absent, from, the, americas, and, from, large, parts, of, australia, but, it, is, present, over, the, majority, of, europe, africa, and, asia, the, genus, aplonis, has, also, spread, widely, across, the, islands, of, the, pacific, reaching, polynesia, melanesia, and, micronesia, in, addition, one, species, in, the, genus, mino, has, reached, the, solomon, islands, also, a, species, of, this, genus, is, the, only, starling, found, in, northern, australia, asian, species, are, most, common, in, evergreen, forests, 39, species, found, in, asia, are, predominantly, forest, birds, as, opposed, to, 24, found, in, more, open, or, human, modified, environments, in, contrast, to, this, african, species, are, more, likely, to, be, found, in, open, woodlands, and, savannah, 33, species, are, open, area, specialists, compared, to, 13, true, forest, species, the, high, diversity, of, species, found, in, asia, and, africa, is, not, matched, by, europe, which, has, one, widespread, and, very, common, species, and, two, more, restricted, species, the, european, starling, is, both, highly, widespread, and, extremely, eclectic, in, its, habitat, occupying, most, types, of, open, habitat, like, many, other, starling, species, it, has, also, adapted, readily, to, human, modified, habitat, including, farmland, orchards, plantations, and, urban, areas, some, species, of, starlings, are, migratory, either, entirely, like, shelley, s, starling, which, breeds, in, ethiopia, and, somaliland, and, migrates, to, kenya, tanzania, and, somalia, or, like, the, white, shouldered, starling, which, is, migratory, in, part, of, its, range, but, is, resident, in, others, the, european, starling, was, purposely, introduced, to, north, america, in, the, 1870s, through, the, 1890s, by, multiple, acclimatisation, societies, organizations, dedicated, to, introducing, european, flora, and, fauna, into, north, america, for, cultural, and, economic, reasons, a, persistent, story, alleges, that, eugene, schieffelin, chairman, of, the, american, acclimatization, society, decided, all, birds, mentioned, by, william, shakespeare, should, be, in, north, america, leading, to, the, introduction, of, the, starling, to, the, u, s, however, this, claim, is, more, fiction, than, fact, while, schieffelin, and, other, members, of, the, society, did, release, starlings, in, central, park, in, 1890, the, birds, had, already, been, in, the, u, s, since, at, least, the, mid, 1870s, and, schieffelin, was, not, inspired, to, do, so, by, shakespeare, s, works, the, starlings, are, generally, a, highly, social, family, most, species, associate, in, flocks, of, varying, sizes, throughout, the, year, murmuration, is, the, flocking, of, starlings, including, the, swarm, behaviour, of, their, large, flight, formations, these, flocks, may, include, other, species, of, starlings, and, sometimes, species, from, other, families, this, sociality, is, particularly, evident, in, their, roosting, behaviour, in, the, nonbreeding, season, some, roosts, can, number, in, the, thousands, of, birds, starlings, imitate, a, variety, of, avian, species, and, have, a, repertoire, of, about, 15, 20, distinct, imitations, they, also, imitate, a, few, sounds, other, than, those, of, wild, birds, the, calls, of, abundant, species, or, calls, that, are, simple, in, frequency, structure, and, show, little, amplitude, modulation, are, preferentially, imitated, dialects, of, mimicked, sounds, can, be, local, the, diets, of, the, starlings, are, usually, dominated, by, fruits, and, insects, many, species, are, important, dispersers, of, seeds, in, asia, and, africa, for, example, white, sandalwood, and, indian, banyan, in, addition, to, trees, they, are, also, important, dispersers, of, parasitic, mistletoes, in, south, africa, the, red, winged, starling, is, an, important, disperser, of, the, introduced, acacia, cyclops, starlings, have, been, observed, feeding, on, fermenting, over, ripe, fruit, which, led, to, the, speculation, that, they, might, become, intoxicated, by, the, alcohol, laboratory, experiments, on, european, starlings, have, found, that, they, have, disposal, enzymes, that, allow, them, to, break, down, alcohol, very, quickly, in, addition, to, consuming, fruits, many, starlings, also, consume, nectar, the, extent, to, which, starlings, are, important, pollinators, is, unknown, but, at, least, some, are, such, as, the, slender, billed, starling, of, alpine, east, africa, which, pollinates, giant, lobelias, the, starling, family, sturnidae, was, introduced, as, sturnidia, by, french, polymath, constantine, samuel, rafinesque, in, 1815, the, starlings, belong, to, the, superfamily, muscicapoidea, together, with, thrushes, flycatchers, and, chats, as, well, as, dippers, which, are, quite, distant, relatives, and, mimidae, thrashers, and, mockingbirds, the, latter, are, apparently, the, sturnidae, s, closest, living, relatives, replace, them, in, the, americas, and, have, a, rather, similar, but, more, solitary, lifestyle, they, are, morphologically, quite, similar, too, a, partly, albinistic, specimen, of, a, mimid, mislabelled, as, to, suggest, an, old, world, origin, was, for, many, decades, believed, to, represent, an, extinct, starling, see, rodrigues, starling, for, details, the, oxpeckers, are, sometimes, placed, here, as, a, subfamily, but, the, weight, of, evidence, has, shifted, towards, granting, them, full, family, status, as, a, more, basal, member, of, the, sturnidae, mimidae, group, derived, from, an, early, expansion, into, africa, usually, the, starlings, are, considered, a, family, as, is, done, here, sibley, monroe, included, the, mimids, in, the, family, and, demoted, the, starlings, to, tribe, rank, as, sturnini, this, treatment, was, used, by, zuccon, et, al, however, the, grouping, of, sibley, monroe, is, overly, coarse, due, to, methodological, drawbacks, of, their, dna, dna, hybridization, technique, and, most, of, their, proposed, revisions, of, taxonomic, rank, have, not, been, accepted, see, for, example, ciconiiformes, the, all, inclusive, sturnidae, grouping, conveys, little, information, about, biogeography, and, obscures, the, evolutionary, distinctness, of, the, three, lineages, establishing, a, valid, name, for, the, clade, consisting, of, sibley, monroe, s, pan, sturnidae, would, nonetheless, be, desirable, to, contrast, them, with, the, other, major, lineages, of, muscicapoidea, starlings, probably, originated, in, the, general, area, of, east, asia, perhaps, towards, the, southwestern, pacific, as, inferred, by, the, number, of, plesiomorphic, lineages, to, occur, there, expansion, into, africa, appears, to, have, occurred, later, as, most, derived, forms, are, found, there, an, alternative, scenario, would, be, african, origin, for, the, entire, sturnoid, group, with, the, oxpeckers, representing, an, ancient, relict, and, the, mimids, arriving, in, south, america, this, is, contradicted, by, the, north, american, distribution, of, the, most, basal, mimidae, as, the, fossil, record, is, limited, to, quite, recent, forms, the, proposed, early, miocene, about, 25, 20, mya, divergence, dates, for, the, sturnoids, lineages, must, be, considered, extremely, tentative, given, the, overall, evidence, for, the, origin, of, most, passeri, families, in, the, first, half, of, the, miocene, it, appears, to, be, not, too, far, off, the, mark, however, as, of, 2007, recent, studies, identified, two, major, clades, of, this, family, corresponding, to, the, generally, drab, often, striped, largish, atypical, mynas, and, other, mainly, asian, pacific, lineages, and, the, often, smaller, sometimes, highly, apomorphic, taxa, which, are, most, common, in, africa, and, the, palearctic, usually, have, metallic, coloration, and, in, a, number, of, species, also, bright, carotinoid, plumage, colors, on, the, underside, inside, this, latter, group, there, is, a, clade, consisting, of, species, which, again, are, usually, not, too, brightly, colored, and, which, consists, of, the, typical, myna, sturnus, assemblage, the, philippine, creepers, a, single, genus, of, three, species, of, treecreeper, like, birds, appear, to, be, highly, apomorphic, members, of, the, more, initial, radiation, of, the, sturnidae, while, this, may, seem, odd, at, first, glance, their, placement, has, always, been, contentious, in, addition, biogeography, virtually, rules, out, a, close, relationship, of, philippine, creepers, and, treecreepers, as, neither, the, latter, nor, their, close, relatives, seem, to, have, ever, reached, wallacea, let, alone, the, philippines, nonetheless, their, inclusion, in, the, sturnidae, is, not, entirely, final, and, eventually, they, may, remain, a, separate, family, genus, sequence, follows, traditional, treatments, this, is, apparently, not, entirely, correct, with, scissirostrum, closer, to, aplonis, than, to, gracula, for, example, and, acridotheres, among, the, most, advanced, genera, too, few, taxa, have, yet, been, studied, as, regards, their, relationships, however, thus, a, change, in, the, sequence, has, to, wait, for, further, studies, as, of, 2023, the, review, by, lovette, rubenstein, 2008, is, the, most, recent, work, on, the, phylogeny, of, the, group, this, taxonomy, is, also, based, on, the, order, of, the, ioc, the, extinct, mascarene, starlings, were, formerly, of, uncertain, relationships, but, are, now, thought, to, belong, to, the, oriental, australasian, clade, being, allied, with, the, bali, myna, however, while, the, two, more, recent, species, fregipilus, and, necropsar, have, been, classified, the, prehistoric, cryptopsar, has, not
