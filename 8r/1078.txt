rice, is, a, cereal, grain, and, in, its, domesticated, form, is, the, staple, food, of, over, half, of, the, world, s, population, particularly, in, asia, and, africa, rice, is, the, seed, of, the, grass, species, oryza, sativa, asian, rice, or, much, less, commonly, oryza, glaberrima, african, rice, asian, rice, was, domesticated, in, china, some, 13, 500, to, 8, 200, years, ago, african, rice, was, domesticated, in, africa, about, 3, 000, years, ago, rice, has, become, commonplace, in, many, cultures, worldwide, in, 2021, 787, million, tons, were, produced, placing, it, fourth, after, sugarcane, maize, and, wheat, only, some, 8, of, rice, is, traded, internationally, china, india, and, indonesia, are, the, largest, consumers, of, rice, a, substantial, amount, of, the, rice, produced, in, developing, nations, is, lost, after, harvest, through, factors, such, as, poor, transport, and, storage, rice, yields, can, be, reduced, by, pests, including, insects, rodents, and, birds, as, well, as, by, weeds, and, by, diseases, such, as, rice, blast, traditional, rice, polycultures, such, as, rice, duck, farming, and, modern, integrated, pest, management, seek, to, control, damage, from, pests, in, a, sustainable, way, many, varieties, of, rice, have, been, bred, to, improve, crop, quality, and, productivity, biotechnology, has, created, green, revolution, rice, able, to, produce, high, yields, when, supplied, with, nitrogen, fertiliser, and, managed, intensively, other, products, are, rice, able, to, express, human, proteins, for, medicinal, use, flood, tolerant, or, deepwater, rice, and, drought, tolerant, and, salt, tolerant, varieties, rice, is, used, as, a, model, organism, in, biology, dry, rice, grain, is, milled, to, remove, the, outer, layers, depending, on, how, much, is, removed, products, range, from, brown, rice, to, rice, with, germ, and, white, rice, some, is, parboiled, to, make, it, easy, to, cook, rice, contains, no, gluten, it, provides, protein, but, not, all, the, essential, amino, acids, needed, for, good, health, rice, of, different, types, is, eaten, around, the, world, long, grain, rice, tends, to, stay, intact, on, cooking, medium, grain, rice, is, stickier, and, is, used, for, sweet, dishes, and, in, italy, for, risotto, and, sticky, short, grain, rice, is, used, in, japanese, sushi, as, it, keeps, its, shape, when, cooked, white, rice, when, cooked, contains, 29, carbohydrate, and, 2, protein, with, some, manganese, golden, rice, is, a, variety, produced, by, genetic, engineering, to, contain, vitamin, a, production, of, rice, is, estimated, to, have, caused, over, 1, of, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, in, 2022, predictions, of, how, rice, yields, will, be, affected, by, climate, change, vary, across, geographies, and, socioeconomic, contexts, in, human, culture, rice, plays, a, role, in, various, religions, and, traditions, such, as, in, weddings, the, rice, plant, can, grow, to, over, 1, m, 3, ft, tall, if, in, deep, water, it, can, reach, a, length, of, 5, m, 16, ft, a, single, plant, may, have, several, leafy, stems, or, tillers, the, upright, stem, is, jointed, with, nodes, along, its, length, a, long, slender, leaf, arises, from, each, node, the, self, fertile, flowers, are, produced, in, a, panicle, a, branched, inflorescence, which, arises, from, the, last, internode, on, the, stem, there, can, be, up, to, 350, spikelets, in, a, panicle, each, containing, male, and, female, flower, parts, anthers, and, ovule, a, fertilised, ovule, develops, into, the, edible, grain, or, caryopsis, rice, is, a, cereal, belonging, to, the, family, poaceae, as, a, tropical, crop, it, can, be, grown, during, the, two, distinct, seasons, dry, and, wet, of, the, year, provided, that, sufficient, water, is, made, available, it, is, normally, an, annual, but, in, the, tropics, it, can, survive, as, a, perennial, producing, a, ratoon, crop, like, all, crops, rice, depends, for, its, growth, on, both, biotic, and, abiotic, environmental, factors, the, principal, biotic, factors, are, crop, variety, pests, and, plant, diseases, abiotic, factors, include, the, soil, type, whether, lowland, or, upland, amount, of, rain, or, irrigation, water, temperature, day, length, and, intensity, of, sunlight, rice, grains, can, be, planted, directly, into, the, field, where, they, will, grow, or, seedlings, can, be, grown, in, a, seedbed, and, transplanted, into, the, field, direct, seeding, needs, some, 60, to, 80, kg, of, grain, per, hectare, while, transplanting, needs, less, around, 40, kg, per, hectare, but, requires, far, more, labour, most, rice, in, asia, is, transplanted, by, hand, mechanical, transplanting, takes, less, time, but, requires, a, carefully, prepared, field, and, seedlings, raised, on, mats, or, in, trays, to, fit, the, machine, rice, does, not, thrive, if, continuously, submerged, rice, can, be, grown, in, different, environments, depending, upon, water, availability, the, usual, arrangement, is, for, lowland, fields, to, be, surrounded, by, bunds, and, flooded, to, a, depth, of, a, few, centimetres, until, around, a, week, before, harvest, time, this, requires, a, large, amount, of, water, the, alternate, wetting, and, drying, technique, uses, less, water, one, form, of, this, is, to, flood, the, field, to, a, depth, of, 5, cm, 2, in, then, to, let, the, water, level, drop, to, 15, cm, 6, in, below, surface, level, as, measured, by, looking, into, a, perforated, field, water, tube, sunk, into, the, soil, and, then, repeating, the, cycle, deepwater, rice, varieties, tolerate, flooding, to, a, depth, of, over, 50, centimetres, for, at, least, a, month, upland, rice, is, grown, without, flooding, in, hilly, or, mountainous, regions, it, is, rainfed, like, wheat, or, maize, across, asia, unmilled, rice, or, paddy, indonesian, and, malay, padi, was, traditionally, the, product, of, smallholder, agriculture, with, manual, harvesting, larger, farms, make, use, of, machines, such, as, combine, harvesters, to, reduce, the, input, of, labour, the, grain, is, ready, to, harvest, when, the, moisture, content, is, 20, 25, harvesting, involves, reaping, stacking, the, cut, stalks, threshing, to, separate, the, grain, and, cleaning, by, winnowing, or, screening, the, rice, grain, is, dried, as, soon, as, possible, to, bring, the, moisture, content, down, to, a, level, that, is, safe, from, mould, fungi, traditional, drying, relies, on, the, heat, of, the, sun, with, the, grain, spread, out, on, mats, or, on, pavements, the, edible, rice, species, are, members, of, the, bop, clade, within, the, grass, family, the, poaceae, the, rice, subfamily, oryzoideae, is, sister, to, the, bamboos, bambusoideae, and, the, cereal, subfamily, pooideae, the, rice, genus, oryza, is, one, of, eleven, in, the, oryzeae, it, is, sister, to, the, phyllorachideae, the, edible, rice, species, o, sativa, and, o, glaberrima, are, among, some, 300, species, or, subspecies, in, the, genus, other, grasses, inc, the, c4, grasses, maize, sorghum, streptogyneae, ehrharteae, phyllorachideae, wild, rices, inc, zizania, other, rice, species, and, subspecies, o, sativa, asian, rice, o, glaberrima, african, rice, bambusoideae, bamboos, pooideae, grasses, and, cereals, inc, wheat, barley, oryza, sativa, rice, was, first, domesticated, in, china, 9, 000, years, ago, by, people, of, neolithic, cultures, in, the, upper, and, lower, yangtze, associated, with, hmong, mien, speakers, and, pre, austronesians, respectively, the, functional, allele, for, nonshattering, the, critical, indicator, of, domestication, in, grains, as, well, as, five, other, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, is, identical, in, both, indica, and, japonica, this, implies, a, single, domestication, event, for, o, sativa, both, indica, and, japonica, forms, of, asian, rice, sprang, from, a, single, domestication, event, in, china, from, the, wild, rice, oryza, rufipogon, despite, this, evidence, it, appears, that, indica, rice, arose, when, japonica, arrived, in, india, about, 4, 500, years, ago, and, hybridised, with, another, rice, whether, an, undomesticated, proto, indica, or, wild, o, nivara, rice, was, introduced, early, into, sino, tibetan, cultures, in, northern, china, by, around, 6000, to, 5600, years, ago, and, to, the, korean, peninsula, and, japan, by, around, 5500, to, 3200, years, ago, it, was, also, carried, into, taiwan, by, the, dapenkeng, culture, by, 5500, to, 4000, years, ago, before, spreading, southwards, via, the, austronesian, migrations, to, island, southeast, asia, madagascar, and, guam, but, did, not, survive, the, voyage, to, the, rest, of, the, pacific, it, reached, austroasiatic, and, kra, dai, speakers, in, mainland, southeast, asia, and, southern, china, by, 5000, years, ago, rice, spread, around, the, rest, of, the, world, through, cultivation, migration, and, trade, eventually, to, the, americas, as, part, of, the, columbian, exchange, after, 1492, the, now, less, common, oryza, glaberrima, african, rice, was, independently, domesticated, in, africa, around, 3, 000, years, ago, and, introduced, to, the, americas, by, the, spanish, in, british, north, america, by, the, time, of, the, start, of, the, american, war, of, independence, rice, had, become, the, fourth, most, valuable, export, commodity, behind, only, tobacco, wheat, and, fish, in, 2021, world, production, of, rice, was, 787, million, tonnes, led, by, china, and, india, with, a, combined, 52, of, the, total, this, placed, rice, fourth, in, the, list, of, crops, by, production, after, sugarcane, maize, and, wheat, other, major, producers, were, bangladesh, indonesia, and, vietnam, 90, of, world, production, is, from, asia, the, average, world, yield, for, rice, was, 4, 7, metric, tons, per, hectare, 2, 1, short, tons, per, acre, in, 2022, yuan, longping, of, china, s, national, hybrid, rice, research, and, development, center, set, a, world, record, for, rice, yield, in, 1999, at, 17, 1, metric, tons, per, hectare, 7, 6, short, tons, per, acre, on, a, demonstration, plot, this, employed, specially, developed, hybrid, rice, and, the, system, of, rice, intensification, sri, an, innovation, in, rice, farming, rice, is, a, major, food, staple, in, asia, latin, america, and, some, parts, of, africa, feeding, over, half, the, world, s, population, however, a, substantial, part, of, the, crop, can, be, lost, post, harvest, through, inefficient, transportation, storage, and, milling, a, quarter, of, the, crop, in, nigeria, is, lost, after, harvest, storage, losses, include, damage, by, mould, fungi, if, the, rice, is, not, dried, sufficiently, in, china, losses, in, modern, metal, silos, were, just, 0, 2, compared, to, 7, 13, when, rice, was, stored, by, rural, households, the, dry, grain, is, milled, to, remove, the, outer, layers, namely, the, husk, and, bran, these, can, be, removed, in, a, single, step, in, two, steps, or, as, in, commercial, milling, in, a, multi, step, process, of, cleaning, dehusking, separation, polishing, grading, and, weighing, brown, rice, only, has, the, inedible, husk, removed, further, milling, removes, bran, and, the, germ, to, create, successively, whiter, products, parboiled, rice, is, subjected, to, a, steaming, process, before, it, is, milled, this, makes, the, grain, harder, and, moves, some, of, the, grain, s, vitamins, and, minerals, into, the, white, part, of, the, rice, so, these, are, retained, after, milling, rice, does, not, contain, gluten, so, is, suitable, for, people, on, a, gluten, free, diet, rice, is, a, good, source, of, protein, and, a, staple, food, in, many, parts, of, the, world, but, it, is, not, a, complete, protein, as, it, does, not, contain, all, of, the, essential, amino, acids, in, sufficient, amounts, for, good, health, world, trade, figures, are, much, smaller, than, those, for, production, as, less, than, 8, of, rice, produced, is, traded, internationally, china, an, exporter, of, rice, in, the, early, 2000s, had, become, the, world, s, largest, importer, of, rice, by, 2013, developing, countries, are, the, main, players, in, the, world, rice, trade, by, 2012, india, was, the, largest, exporter, of, rice, with, thailand, and, vietnam, the, other, largest, exporters, as, of, 2016, the, countries, that, consumed, the, most, rice, were, china, 29, of, total, india, and, indonesia, by, 2020, bangladesh, had, taken, third, place, from, indonesia, on, an, annual, average, from, 2020, 23, china, consumed, 154, million, tonnes, of, rice, india, consumed, 109, million, tonnes, and, bangladesh, and, indonesia, consumed, about, 36, million, tonnes, each, across, the, world, rice, consumption, per, capita, fell, in, the, 21st, century, as, people, in, asia, and, elsewhere, ate, less, grain, and, more, meat, an, exception, is, sub, saharan, africa, where, both, per, capita, consumption, of, rice, and, population, are, increasing, rice, is, a, commonly, eaten, food, around, the, world, the, varieties, of, rice, are, typically, classified, as, short, medium, and, long, grained, oryza, sativa, indica, varieties, are, usually, long, grained, oryza, sativa, japonica, varieties, are, usually, short, or, medium, grained, short, grain, rice, with, the, exception, of, spanish, bomba, is, usually, sticky, when, cooked, and, is, suitable, for, puddings, thai, jasmine, rice, is, aromatic, and, unusually, for, a, long, grain, rice, has, some, stickiness, with, a, soft, texture, indian, basmati, rice, is, very, long, grained, and, aromatic, italian, arborio, rice, used, for, risotto, is, of, medium, length, oval, and, quite, sticky, japanese, sushi, rice, is, a, sticky, short, grain, variety, cooked, white, rice, is, 69, water, 29, carbohydrates, 2, protein, and, contains, negligible, fat, table, in, a, reference, serving, of, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, cooked, white, rice, provides, 130, calories, of, food, energy, and, contains, moderate, levels, of, manganese, 18, dv, with, no, other, micronutrients, in, significant, content, all, less, than, 10, of, the, daily, value, in, 2018, the, world, health, organization, strongly, recommended, fortifying, rice, with, iron, and, conditionally, recommended, fortifying, it, with, vitamin, a, and, with, folic, acid, golden, rice, is, a, variety, produced, through, genetic, engineering, to, synthesize, beta, carotene, a, precursor, of, vitamin, a, in, the, endosperm, of, the, rice, grain, it, is, intended, to, be, grown, and, eaten, in, parts, of, the, world, where, vitamin, a, deficiency, is, prevalent, golden, rice, has, been, opposed, by, activists, such, as, in, the, philippines, in, 2016, more, than, 100, nobel, laureates, encouraged, the, use, of, genetically, modified, organisms, such, as, golden, rice, for, the, benefits, these, could, bring, in, 2022, greenhouse, gas, emissions, from, rice, cultivation, were, estimated, at, 5, 7, billion, tonnes, co2eq, representing, 1, 2, of, total, emissions, within, the, agriculture, sector, rice, produces, almost, half, the, greenhouse, gas, emissions, from, croplands, some, 30, of, agricultural, methane, emissions, and, 11, of, agricultural, nitrous, oxide, emissions, methane, is, released, from, rice, fields, subject, to, long, term, flooding, as, this, inhibits, the, soil, from, absorbing, atmospheric, oxygen, resulting, in, anaerobic, fermentation, of, organic, matter, in, the, soil, emissions, can, be, limited, by, planting, new, varieties, not, flooding, continuously, and, removing, straw, it, is, possible, to, cut, methane, emissions, in, rice, cultivation, by, improved, water, management, combining, dry, seeding, and, one, drawdown, or, executing, a, sequence, of, wetting, and, drying, this, results, in, emission, reductions, of, up, to, 90, compared, to, full, flooding, and, even, increased, yields, predictions, of, climate, change, s, effects, on, rice, cultivation, vary, global, rice, yield, has, been, projected, to, decrease, by, around, 3, 2, with, each, 1, c, increase, in, global, average, temperature, while, another, study, predicts, global, rice, cultivation, will, increase, initially, plateauing, at, about, 3, c, warming, 2091, 2100, relative, to, 1850, 1900, the, impacts, of, climate, change, on, rice, cultivation, vary, across, geographic, location, and, socioeconomic, context, for, example, rising, temperatures, and, decreasing, solar, radiation, during, the, later, years, of, the, 20th, century, decreased, rice, yield, by, between, 10, and, 20, across, 200, farms, in, seven, asian, countries, this, may, have, been, caused, by, increased, night, time, respiration, irri, has, predicted, that, asian, rice, yields, will, fall, by, some, 20, per, 1, c, rise, in, global, mean, temperature, further, rice, is, unable, to, yield, grain, if, the, flowers, experience, a, temperature, of, 35, c, or, more, for, over, one, hour, so, the, crop, would, be, lost, under, these, conditions, in, the, po, valley, in, italy, the, arborio, and, carnaroli, risotto, rice, varieties, have, suffered, poor, harvests, through, drought, in, the, 21st, century, the, ente, nazionale, risi, is, developing, drought, resistant, varieties, its, nuovo, prometeo, variety, has, deep, roots, that, enable, it, to, tolerate, drought, but, is, not, suitable, for, risotto, rice, yield, can, be, reduced, by, weed, growth, and, a, wide, variety, of, pests, including, insects, nematodes, rodents, such, as, rats, snails, and, birds, major, rice, insect, pests, include, armyworms, rice, bugs, black, bugs, cutworms, field, crickets, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, mealybugs, and, planthoppers, high, rates, of, nitrogen, fertiliser, application, may, worsen, aphid, outbreaks, weather, conditions, can, contribute, to, pest, outbreaks, rice, gall, midge, outbreaks, are, worsened, by, high, rainfall, in, the, wet, season, while, thrips, outbreaks, are, associated, with, drought, rice, blast, caused, by, the, fungus, magnaporthe, grisea, is, the, most, serious, disease, of, growing, rice, it, and, bacterial, leaf, streak, caused, by, xanthomonas, oryzae, pv, oryzae, are, perennially, the, two, worst, rice, diseases, worldwide, they, are, both, among, the, ten, most, important, diseases, of, all, crop, plants, other, major, rice, diseases, include, sheath, blight, caused, by, rhizoctonia, solani, false, smut, ustilaginoidea, virens, and, bacterial, panicle, blight, burkholderia, glumae, viral, diseases, include, rice, bunchy, stunt, rice, dwarf, rice, tungro, and, rice, yellow, mottle, crop, protection, scientists, are, developing, sustainable, techniques, for, managing, rice, pests, sustainable, pest, management, is, based, on, four, principles, biodiversity, host, plant, resistance, landscape, ecology, and, hierarchies, in, a, landscape, from, biological, to, social, farmers, pesticide, applications, are, often, unnecessary, pesticides, may, actually, induce, resurgence, of, populations, of, rice, pests, such, as, the, brown, planthopper, both, by, destroying, beneficial, insects, and, by, enhancing, the, pest, s, reproduction, the, international, rice, research, institute, irri, demonstrated, in, 1993, that, an, 87, 5, reduction, in, pesticide, use, can, lead, to, an, overall, drop, in, pest, numbers, farmers, in, china, indonesia, and, the, philippines, have, traditionally, managed, weeds, and, pests, by, the, polycultural, practice, of, raising, ducks, and, sometimes, fish, in, their, rice, paddies, these, produce, valuable, additional, crops, eat, small, pest, animals, manure, the, rice, and, in, the, case, of, ducks, also, control, weeds, rice, plants, produce, their, own, chemical, defences, to, protect, themselves, from, pest, attacks, some, synthetic, chemicals, such, as, the, herbicide, 2, 4, d, cause, the, plant, to, increase, the, production, of, certain, defensive, chemicals, and, thereby, increase, the, plant, s, resistance, to, some, types, of, pests, conversely, other, chemicals, such, as, the, insecticide, imidacloprid, appear, to, induce, changes, in, the, gene, expression, of, the, rice, that, make, the, plant, more, susceptible, to, certain, pests, plant, breeders, have, created, rice, cultivars, incorporating, resistance, to, various, insect, pests, conventional, plant, breeding, of, resistant, varieties, has, been, limited, by, challenges, such, as, rearing, insect, pests, for, testing, and, the, great, diversity, and, continuous, evolution, of, pests, resistance, genes, are, being, sought, from, wild, species, of, rice, and, genetic, engineering, techniques, are, being, applied, the, international, rice, research, institute, maintains, the, international, rice, genebank, which, holds, over, 100, 000, rice, varieties, much, of, southeast, asia, grows, sticky, or, glutinous, rice, varieties, high, yield, cultivars, of, rice, suitable, for, cultivation, in, africa, called, the, new, rice, for, africa, nerica, have, been, developed, to, improve, food, security, and, alleviate, poverty, in, sub, saharan, africa, the, complete, genome, of, rice, was, sequenced, in, 2005, making, it, the, first, crop, plant, to, reach, this, status, since, then, the, genomes, of, hundreds, of, types, of, rice, both, wild, and, cultivated, and, including, both, asian, and, african, rice, species, have, been, sequenced, the, high, yielding, varieties, are, a, group, of, crops, created, during, the, green, revolution, to, increase, global, food, production, radically, the, first, green, revolution, rice, variety, ir8, was, produced, in, 1966, at, the, international, rice, research, institute, through, a, cross, between, an, indonesian, variety, named, peta, and, a, chinese, variety, named, dee, geo, woo, gen, green, revolution, varieties, were, bred, to, have, short, strong, stems, so, that, the, rice, would, not, lodge, or, fall, over, this, enabled, them, to, stay, upright, and, productive, even, with, heavy, applications, of, fertiliser, ventria, bioscience, has, genetically, modified, rice, to, express, lactoferrin, and, lysozyme, which, are, proteins, usually, found, in, breast, milk, and, human, serum, albumin, these, proteins, have, antiviral, antibacterial, and, antifungal, effects, rice, containing, these, added, proteins, can, be, used, as, a, component, in, oral, rehydration, solutions, to, treat, diarrheal, diseases, thereby, shortening, their, duration, and, reducing, recurrence, such, supplements, may, also, help, reverse, anemia, in, areas, subject, to, flooding, farmers, have, long, planted, flood, tolerant, varieties, known, as, deepwater, rice, in, south, and, south, east, asia, flooding, affects, some, 20, million, hectares, 49, million, acres, each, year, flooding, has, historically, led, to, massive, losses, in, yields, such, as, in, the, philippines, where, in, 2006, rice, crops, worth, 65, million, were, lost, to, flooding, standard, rice, varieties, cannot, withstand, stagnant, flooding, for, more, than, about, a, week, since, it, disallows, the, plant, access, to, necessary, requirements, such, as, sunlight, and, gas, exchange, the, swarna, sub1, cultivar, can, tolerate, week, long, submergence, consuming, carbohydrates, efficiently, and, continuing, to, grow, so, called, scuba, rice, with, the, sub1a, transgene, is, robustly, tolerant, of, submergence, for, as, long, as, two, weeks, offering, much, improved, flood, survival, for, farmers, crops, irri, has, created, sub1a, varieties, and, distributed, them, to, bangladesh, india, indonesia, nepal, and, the, philippines, drought, represents, a, significant, environmental, stress, for, rice, production, with, 19, 23, million, hectares, 47, 57, million, acres, of, rainfed, rice, production, in, south, and, south, east, asia, often, at, risk, under, drought, conditions, without, sufficient, water, to, afford, them, the, ability, to, obtain, the, required, levels, of, nutrients, from, the, soil, conventional, commercial, rice, varieties, can, be, severely, affected, as, happened, for, example, in, india, early, in, the, 21st, century, the, international, rice, research, institute, conducts, research, into, developing, drought, tolerant, rice, varieties, including, the, varieties, sahbhagi, dhan, sahod, ulan, and, sookha, dhan, currently, being, employed, by, farmers, in, india, the, philippines, and, nepal, respectively, in, addition, in, 2013, the, japanese, national, institute, for, agrobiological, sciences, led, a, team, which, successfully, inserted, the, deeper, rooting, 1, dro1, gene, from, the, philippine, upland, rice, variety, kinandang, patong, into, the, popular, commercial, rice, variety, ir64, giving, rise, to, a, far, deeper, root, system, in, the, resulting, plants, this, facilitates, an, improved, ability, for, the, rice, plant, to, derive, its, required, nutrients, in, times, of, drought, via, accessing, deeper, layers, of, soil, a, feature, demonstrated, by, trials, which, saw, the, ir64, dro1, rice, yields, drop, by, 10, under, moderate, drought, conditions, compared, to, 60, for, the, unmodified, ir64, variety, soil, salinity, poses, a, major, threat, to, rice, crop, productivity, particularly, along, low, lying, coastal, areas, during, the, dry, season, for, example, roughly, 1, million, hectares, 2, 5, million, acres, of, the, coastal, areas, of, bangladesh, are, affected, by, saline, soils, these, high, concentrations, of, salt, can, severely, affect, rice, plants, physiology, especially, during, early, stages, of, growth, and, as, such, farmers, are, often, forced, to, abandon, these, areas, progress, has, been, made, in, developing, rice, varieties, capable, of, tolerating, such, conditions, the, hybrid, created, from, the, cross, between, the, commercial, rice, variety, ir56, and, the, wild, rice, species, oryza, coarctata, is, one, example, o, coarctata, can, grow, in, soils, with, double, the, limit, of, salinity, of, normal, varieties, but, does, not, produce, edible, rice, developed, by, the, international, rice, research, institute, the, hybrid, variety, utilises, specialised, leaf, glands, that, remove, salt, into, the, atmosphere, it, was, produced, from, one, successful, embryo, out, of, 34, 000, crosses, between, the, two, species, this, was, then, backcrossed, to, ir56, with, the, aim, of, preserving, the, genes, responsible, for, salt, tolerance, that, were, inherited, from, o, coarctata, rice, is, sensitive, to, temperatures, below, 12c, sowing, takes, place, once, the, daily, average, temperature, is, reliably, above, this, limit, average, temperatures, below, that, reduce, growth, if, sustained, for, over, four, days, germination, and, seedling, growth, are, harmed, and, seedlings, may, die, in, larger, plants, subjected, to, cold, rice, blast, is, encouraged, seriously, reducing, yield, as, of, 2022, researchers, continue, to, study, the, mechanisms, of, chilling, tolerance, in, rice, and, its, genetic, basis, producing, rice, in, paddies, is, harmful, for, the, environment, due, to, the, release, of, methane, by, methanogenic, bacteria, these, bacteria, live, in, the, anaerobic, waterlogged, soil, consuming, nutrients, released, by, rice, roots, putting, the, barley, gene, susiba2, into, rice, creates, a, shift, in, biomass, production, from, root, to, shoot, decreasing, the, methanogen, population, and, resulting, in, a, reduction, of, methane, emissions, of, up, to, 97, further, the, modification, increases, the, amount, of, rice, grains, rice, is, used, as, a, model, organism, for, investigating, the, mechanisms, of, meiosis, and, dna, repair, in, higher, plants, for, example, study, using, rice, has, shown, that, the, gene, osrad51c, is, necessary, for, the, accurate, repair, of, dna, double, strand, breaks, during, meiosis, rice, plays, an, important, role, in, certain, religions, and, popular, beliefs, in, hindu, wedding, ceremonies, rice, denoting, fertility, prosperity, and, purity, is, thrown, into, the, sacred, fire, a, custom, modified, in, western, weddings, where, people, throw, rice, in, malay, weddings, rice, features, in, multiple, special, wedding, foods, such, as, sweet, glutinous, rice, in, japan, and, the, philippines, rice, wine, is, used, for, weddings, and, other, celebrations, dewi, sri, is, a, goddess, of, the, indo, malaysian, archipelago, who, in, myth, is, transformed, into, rice, or, other, crops, the, start, of, the, rice, planting, season, is, marked, in, asian, countries, including, nepal, and, cambodia, with, a, royal, ploughing, ceremony
