toothache, also, known, as, dental, pain, or, tooth, pain, is, pain, in, the, teeth, or, their, supporting, structures, caused, by, dental, diseases, or, pain, referred, to, the, teeth, by, non, dental, diseases, when, severe, it, may, impact, sleep, eating, and, other, daily, activities, common, causes, include, inflammation, of, the, pulp, usually, in, response, to, tooth, decay, dental, trauma, or, other, factors, dentin, hypersensitivity, apical, periodontitis, inflammation, of, the, periodontal, ligament, and, alveolar, bone, around, the, root, apex, dental, abscesses, localized, collections, of, pus, alveolar, osteitis, dry, socket, a, possible, complication, of, tooth, extraction, acute, necrotizing, ulcerative, gingivitis, a, gum, infection, and, temporomandibular, disorder, pulpitis, is, reversible, when, the, pain, is, mild, to, moderate, and, lasts, for, a, short, time, after, a, stimulus, for, instance, cold, or, irreversible, when, the, pain, is, severe, spontaneous, and, lasts, a, long, time, after, a, stimulus, left, untreated, pulpitis, may, become, irreversible, then, progress, to, pulp, necrosis, death, of, the, pulp, and, apical, periodontitis, abscesses, usually, cause, throbbing, pain, the, apical, abscess, usually, occurs, after, pulp, necrosis, the, pericoronal, abscess, is, usually, associated, with, acute, pericoronitis, of, a, lower, wisdom, tooth, and, periodontal, abscesses, usually, represent, a, complication, of, chronic, periodontitis, gum, disease, less, commonly, non, dental, conditions, can, cause, toothache, such, as, maxillary, sinusitis, which, can, cause, pain, in, the, upper, back, teeth, or, angina, pectoris, which, can, cause, pain, in, the, lower, teeth, correct, diagnosis, can, sometimes, be, challenging, proper, oral, hygiene, helps, to, prevent, toothache, by, preventing, dental, disease, the, treatment, of, a, toothache, depends, upon, the, exact, cause, and, may, involve, a, filling, root, canal, treatment, extraction, drainage, of, pus, or, other, remedial, action, the, relief, of, toothache, is, considered, one, of, the, main, responsibilities, of, dentists, toothache, is, the, most, common, type, of, pain, in, the, mouth, or, face, 125, 135, it, is, one, of, the, most, common, reasons, for, emergency, dental, appointments, in, 2013, 223, million, cases, of, toothache, occurred, as, a, result, of, dental, caries, in, permanent, teeth, and, 53, million, cases, occurred, in, baby, teeth, historically, the, demand, for, treatment, of, toothache, is, thought, to, have, led, to, the, emergence, of, dental, surgery, as, the, first, specialty, of, medicine, toothache, may, be, caused, by, dental, odontogenic, conditions, such, as, those, involving, the, dentin, pulp, complex, or, periodontium, or, by, non, dental, non, odontogenic, conditions, such, as, maxillary, sinusitis, or, angina, pectoris, there, are, many, possible, non, dental, causes, but, the, vast, majority, of, toothache, is, dental, in, origin, both, the, pulp, and, periodontal, ligament, have, nociceptors, pain, receptors, but, the, pulp, lacks, proprioceptors, motion, or, position, receptors, and, mechanoreceptors, mechanical, pressure, receptors, 125, 135, consequently, pain, originating, from, the, dentin, pulp, complex, tends, to, be, poorly, localized, whereas, pain, from, the, periodontal, ligament, will, typically, be, well, localized, 55, although, not, always, 125, 135, for, instance, the, periodontal, ligament, can, detect, the, pressure, exerted, when, biting, on, something, smaller, than, a, grain, of, sand, 10, 30, m, 48, when, a, tooth, is, intentionally, stimulated, about, 33, of, people, can, correctly, identify, the, tooth, and, about, 20, cannot, narrow, the, stimulus, location, down, to, a, group, of, three, teeth, 31, another, typical, difference, between, pulpal, and, periodontal, pain, is, that, the, latter, is, not, usually, made, worse, by, thermal, stimuli, 125, 135, the, majority, of, pulpal, toothache, falls, into, one, of, the, following, types, however, other, rare, causes, which, do, not, always, fit, neatly, into, these, categories, include, galvanic, pain, and, barodontalgia, pulpitis, inflammation, of, the, pulp, can, be, triggered, by, various, stimuli, insults, including, mechanical, thermal, chemical, and, bacterial, irritants, or, rarely, barometric, changes, and, ionizing, radiation, common, causes, include, tooth, decay, dental, trauma, such, as, a, crack, or, fracture, or, a, filling, with, an, imperfect, seal, because, the, pulp, is, encased, in, a, rigid, outer, shell, there, is, no, space, to, accommodate, swelling, caused, by, inflammation, inflammation, therefore, increases, pressure, in, the, pulp, system, potentially, compressing, the, blood, vessels, which, supply, the, pulp, this, may, lead, to, ischemia, lack, of, oxygen, and, necrosis, tissue, death, pulpitis, is, termed, reversible, when, the, inflamed, pulp, is, capable, of, returning, to, a, state, of, health, and, irreversible, when, pulp, necrosis, is, inevitable, 36, 37, reversible, pulpitis, is, characterized, by, short, lasting, pain, triggered, by, cold, and, sometimes, heat, the, symptoms, of, reversible, pulpitis, may, disappear, either, because, the, noxious, stimulus, is, removed, such, as, when, dental, decay, is, removed, and, a, filling, placed, or, because, new, layers, of, dentin, tertiary, dentin, have, been, produced, inside, the, pulp, chamber, insulating, against, the, stimulus, irreversible, pulpitis, causes, spontaneous, or, lingering, pain, in, response, to, cold, 619, 627, dentin, hypersensitivity, is, a, sharp, short, lasting, dental, pain, occurring, in, about, 15, of, the, population, which, is, triggered, by, cold, such, as, liquids, or, air, sweet, or, spicy, foods, and, beverages, teeth, will, normally, have, some, sensation, to, these, triggers, but, what, separates, hypersensitivity, from, regular, tooth, sensation, is, the, intensity, of, the, pain, hypersensitivity, is, most, commonly, caused, by, a, lack, of, insulation, from, the, triggers, in, the, mouth, due, to, gingival, recession, receding, gums, exposing, the, roots, of, the, teeth, although, it, can, occur, after, scaling, and, root, planing, or, dental, bleaching, or, as, a, result, of, erosion, the, pulp, of, the, tooth, remains, normal, and, healthy, in, dentin, hypersensitivity, 510, many, topical, treatments, for, dentin, hypersensitivity, are, available, including, desensitizing, toothpastes, and, protective, varnishes, that, coat, the, exposed, dentin, surface, treatment, of, the, root, cause, is, critical, as, topical, measures, are, typically, short, lasting, 510, over, time, the, pulp, usually, adapts, by, producing, new, layers, of, dentin, inside, the, pulp, chamber, called, tertiary, dentin, increasing, the, thickness, between, the, pulp, and, the, exposed, dentin, surface, and, lessening, the, hypersensitivity, 510, in, general, chronic, periodontal, conditions, do, not, cause, any, pain, rather, it, is, acute, inflammation, which, is, responsible, for, the, pain, apical, periodontitis, is, acute, or, chronic, inflammation, around, the, apex, of, a, tooth, caused, by, an, immune, response, to, bacteria, within, an, infected, pulp, it, does, not, occur, because, of, pulp, necrosis, meaning, that, a, tooth, that, tests, as, if, it, s, alive, vital, may, cause, apical, periodontitis, and, a, pulp, which, has, become, non, vital, due, to, a, sterile, non, infectious, processes, such, as, trauma, may, not, cause, any, apical, periodontitis, 225, bacterial, cytotoxins, reach, the, region, around, the, roots, of, the, tooth, via, the, apical, foramina, and, lateral, canals, causing, vasodilation, sensitization, of, nerves, osteolysis, bone, resorption, and, potentially, abscess, or, cyst, formation, 228, the, periodontal, ligament, becomes, inflamed, and, there, may, be, pain, when, biting, or, tapping, on, the, tooth, on, an, x, ray, bone, resorption, appears, as, a, radiolucent, area, around, the, end, of, the, root, although, this, does, not, manifest, immediately, 228, acute, apical, periodontitis, is, characterized, by, well, localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate, to, severe, pain, 125, 135, the, alveolar, process, may, be, tender, to, palpation, over, the, roots, the, tooth, may, be, raised, in, the, socket, and, feel, more, prominent, than, the, adjacent, teeth, 125, 135, food, impaction, occurs, when, food, debris, especially, fibrous, food, such, as, meat, becomes, trapped, between, two, teeth, and, is, pushed, into, the, gums, during, chewing, 125, 135, the, usual, cause, of, food, impaction, is, disruption, of, the, normal, interproximal, contour, or, drifting, of, teeth, so, that, a, gap, is, created, an, open, contact, decay, can, lead, to, collapse, of, part, of, the, tooth, or, a, dental, restoration, may, not, accurately, reproduce, the, contact, point, irritation, localized, discomfort, or, mild, pain, and, a, feeling, of, pressure, from, between, the, two, teeth, results, the, gingival, papilla, is, swollen, tender, and, bleeds, when, touched, the, pain, occurs, during, and, after, eating, and, may, slowly, disappear, before, being, evoked, again, at, the, next, meal, or, relieved, immediately, by, using, a, tooth, pick, or, dental, floss, in, the, involved, area, 125, 135, a, gingival, or, periodontal, abscess, may, develop, from, this, situation, 444, 445, a, periodontal, abscess, lateral, abscess, is, a, collection, of, pus, that, forms, in, the, gingival, crevices, usually, as, a, result, of, chronic, periodontitis, where, the, pockets, are, pathologically, deepened, greater, than, 3mm, a, healthy, gingival, pocket, will, contain, bacteria, and, some, calculus, kept, in, check, by, the, immune, system, as, the, pocket, deepens, the, balance, is, disrupted, and, an, acute, inflammatory, response, results, forming, pus, the, debris, and, swelling, then, disrupt, the, normal, flow, of, fluids, into, and, out, of, the, pocket, rapidly, accelerating, the, inflammatory, cycle, larger, pockets, also, have, a, greater, likelihood, of, collecting, food, debris, creating, additional, sources, of, infection, 443, periodontal, abscesses, are, less, common, than, apical, abscesses, but, are, still, frequent, the, key, difference, between, the, two, is, that, the, pulp, of, the, tooth, tends, to, be, alive, and, will, respond, normally, to, pulp, tests, however, an, untreated, periodontal, abscess, may, still, cause, the, pulp, to, die, if, it, reaches, the, tooth, apex, in, a, periodontic, endodontic, lesion, a, periodontal, abscess, can, occur, as, the, result, of, tooth, fracture, food, packing, into, a, periodontal, pocket, with, poorly, shaped, fillings, calculus, build, up, and, lowered, immune, responses, such, as, in, diabetes, periodontal, abscess, can, also, occur, after, periodontal, scaling, which, causes, the, gums, to, tighten, around, the, teeth, and, trap, debris, in, the, pocket, 444, 445, toothache, caused, by, a, periodontal, abscess, is, generally, deep, and, throbbing, the, oral, mucosa, covering, an, early, periodontal, abscess, appears, erythematous, red, swollen, shiny, and, painful, to, touch, a, variant, of, the, periodontal, abscess, is, the, gingival, abscess, which, is, limited, to, the, gingival, margin, has, a, quicker, onset, and, is, typically, caused, by, trauma, from, items, such, as, a, fishbone, toothpick, or, toothbrush, rather, than, chronic, periodontitis, 446, 447, the, treatment, of, a, periodontal, abscess, is, similar, to, the, management, of, dental, abscesses, in, general, see, treatment, however, since, the, tooth, is, typically, alive, there, is, no, difficulty, in, accessing, the, source, of, infection, and, therefore, antibiotics, are, more, routinely, used, in, conjunction, with, scaling, and, root, planing, the, occurrence, of, a, periodontal, abscess, usually, indicates, advanced, periodontal, disease, which, requires, correct, management, to, prevent, recurrent, abscesses, including, daily, cleaning, below, the, gumline, to, prevent, the, buildup, of, subgingival, plaque, and, calculus, common, marginal, gingivitis, in, response, to, subgingival, plaque, is, usually, a, painless, condition, however, an, acute, form, of, gingivitis, periodontitis, termed, acute, necrotizing, ulcerative, gingivitis, anug, can, develop, often, suddenly, it, is, associated, with, severe, periodontal, pain, bleeding, gums, punched, out, ulceration, loss, of, the, interdental, papillae, and, possibly, also, halitosis, bad, breath, and, a, bad, taste, predisposing, factors, include, poor, oral, hygiene, smoking, malnutrition, psychological, stress, and, immunosuppression, 97, 98, this, condition, is, not, contagious, but, multiple, cases, may, simultaneously, occur, in, populations, who, share, the, same, risk, factors, such, as, students, in, a, dormitory, during, a, period, of, examination, anug, is, treated, over, several, visits, first, with, debridement, of, the, necrotic, gingiva, homecare, with, hydrogen, peroxide, mouthwash, analgesics, and, when, the, pain, has, subsided, sufficiently, cleaning, below, the, gumline, both, professionally, and, at, home, antibiotics, are, not, indicated, in, anug, management, unless, there, is, underlying, systemic, disease, 437, 438, pericoronitis, is, inflammation, of, the, soft, tissues, surrounding, the, crown, of, a, partially, erupted, tooth, the, lower, wisdom, tooth, is, the, last, tooth, to, erupt, into, the, mouth, and, is, therefore, more, frequently, impacted, or, stuck, against, the, other, teeth, this, leaves, the, tooth, partially, erupted, into, the, mouth, and, there, frequently, is, a, flap, of, gum, an, operculum, overlying, the, tooth, bacteria, and, food, debris, accumulate, beneath, the, operculum, which, is, an, area, that, is, difficult, to, keep, clean, because, it, is, hidden, and, far, back, in, the, mouth, the, opposing, upper, wisdom, tooth, also, tends, to, have, sharp, cusps, and, over, erupt, because, it, has, no, opposing, tooth, to, bite, into, and, instead, traumatizes, the, operculum, further, periodontitis, and, dental, caries, may, develop, on, either, the, third, or, second, molars, and, chronic, inflammation, develops, in, the, soft, tissues, chronic, pericoronitis, may, not, cause, any, pain, but, an, acute, pericoronitis, episode, is, often, associated, with, pericoronal, abscess, formation, typical, signs, and, symptoms, of, a, pericoronal, abscess, include, severe, throbbing, pain, which, may, radiate, to, adjacent, areas, in, the, head, and, neck, 122, redness, swelling, and, tenderness, of, the, gum, over, the, tooth, 220, 222, there, may, be, trismus, difficulty, opening, the, mouth, 220, 222, facial, swelling, and, rubor, flushing, of, the, cheek, that, overlies, the, angle, of, the, jaw, 122, persons, typically, develop, pericoronitis, in, their, late, teens, and, early, 20s, 6, as, this, is, the, age, that, the, wisdom, teeth, are, erupting, treatment, for, acute, conditions, includes, cleaning, the, area, under, the, operculum, with, an, antiseptic, solution, painkillers, and, antibiotics, if, indicated, after, the, acute, episode, has, been, controlled, the, definitive, treatment, is, usually, by, tooth, extraction, or, less, commonly, the, soft, tissue, is, removed, operculectomy, if, the, tooth, is, kept, good, oral, hygiene, is, required, to, keep, the, area, free, of, debris, to, prevent, recurrence, of, the, infection, 440, 441, occlusal, trauma, results, from, excessive, biting, forces, exerted, on, teeth, which, overloads, the, periodontal, ligament, causing, periodontal, pain, and, a, reversible, increase, in, tooth, mobility, occlusal, trauma, may, occur, with, bruxism, the, parafunctional, abnormal, clenching, and, grinding, of, teeth, during, sleep, or, while, awake, over, time, there, may, be, attrition, tooth, wear, which, may, also, cause, dentin, hypersensitivity, and, possibly, formation, of, a, periodontal, abscess, as, the, occlusal, trauma, causes, adaptive, changes, in, the, alveolar, bone, 153, 154, occlusal, trauma, often, occurs, when, a, newly, placed, dental, restoration, is, built, too, high, concentrating, the, biting, forces, on, one, tooth, height, differences, measuring, less, than, a, millimeter, can, cause, pain, dentists, therefore, routinely, check, that, any, new, restoration, is, in, harmony, with, the, bite, and, forces, are, distributed, correctly, over, many, teeth, using, articulating, paper, if, the, high, spot, is, quickly, eliminated, the, pain, disappears, and, there, is, no, permanent, harm, 153, 753, over, tightening, of, braces, can, cause, periodontal, pain, and, occasionally, a, periodontal, abscess, 503, alveolar, osteitis, is, a, complication, of, tooth, extraction, especially, lower, wisdom, teeth, in, which, the, blood, clot, is, not, formed, or, is, lost, leaving, the, socket, where, the, tooth, used, to, be, empty, and, bare, bone, is, exposed, to, the, mouth, the, pain, is, moderate, to, severe, and, dull, aching, and, throbbing, in, character, the, pain, is, localized, to, the, socket, and, may, radiate, it, normally, starts, two, to, four, days, after, the, extraction, and, may, last, 10, 40, days, 122, 216, 217, healing, is, delayed, and, it, is, treated, with, local, anesthetic, dressings, which, are, typically, required, for, five, to, seven, days, 216, 217, there, is, some, evidence, that, chlorhexidine, mouthwash, used, prior, to, extractions, prevents, alveolar, osteitis, cracked, tooth, syndrome, refers, to, a, highly, variable, set, of, pain, sensitivity, symptoms, that, may, accompany, a, tooth, fracture, usually, sporadic, sharp, pain, that, occurs, during, biting, or, with, release, of, biting, pressure, or, relieved, by, releasing, pressure, on, the, tooth, 24, the, term, is, falling, into, disfavor, and, has, given, way, to, the, more, generalized, description, of, fractures, and, cracks, of, the, tooth, which, allows, for, the, wide, variations, in, signs, symptoms, and, prognosis, for, traumatized, teeth, a, fracture, of, a, tooth, can, involve, the, enamel, dentin, and, or, pulp, and, can, be, orientated, horizontally, or, vertically, 24, 25, fractured, or, cracked, teeth, can, cause, pain, via, several, mechanisms, including, dentin, hypersensitivity, pulpitis, reversible, or, irreversible, or, periodontal, pain, accordingly, there, is, no, single, test, or, combination, of, symptoms, that, accurately, diagnose, a, fracture, or, crack, although, when, pain, can, be, stimulated, by, causing, separation, of, the, cusps, of, the, tooth, it, s, highly, suggestive, of, the, disorder, 27, 31, vertical, fractures, can, be, very, difficult, to, identify, because, the, crack, can, rarely, be, probed, 27, or, seen, on, radiographs, as, the, fracture, runs, in, the, plane, of, conventional, films, similar, to, how, the, split, between, two, adjacent, panes, of, glass, is, invisible, when, facing, them, 28, 9, when, toothache, results, from, dental, trauma, regardless, of, the, exact, pulpal, or, periodontal, diagnosis, the, treatment, and, prognosis, is, dependent, on, the, extent, of, damage, to, the, tooth, the, stage, of, development, of, the, tooth, the, degree, of, displacement, or, when, the, tooth, is, avulsed, the, time, out, of, the, socket, and, the, starting, health, of, the, tooth, and, bone, because, of, the, high, variation, in, treatment, and, prognosis, dentists, often, use, trauma, guides, to, help, determine, prognosis, and, direct, treatment, decisions, the, prognosis, for, a, cracked, tooth, varies, with, the, extent, of, the, fracture, those, cracks, that, are, irritating, the, pulp, but, do, not, extend, through, the, pulp, chamber, can, be, amenable, to, stabilizing, dental, restorations, such, as, a, crown, or, composite, resin, should, the, fracture, extend, though, the, pulp, chamber, and, into, the, root, the, prognosis, of, the, tooth, is, hopeless, 25, apical, abscesses, can, spread, to, involve, periodontal, pockets, around, a, tooth, and, periodontal, pockets, cause, eventual, pulp, necrosis, via, accessory, canals, or, the, apical, foramen, at, the, bottom, of, the, tooth, such, lesions, are, termed, periodontic, endodontic, lesions, and, they, may, be, acutely, painful, sharing, similar, signs, and, symptoms, with, a, periodontal, abscess, or, they, may, cause, mild, pain, or, no, pain, at, all, if, they, are, chronic, and, free, draining, successful, root, canal, therapy, is, required, before, periodontal, treatment, is, attempted, 49, generally, the, long, term, prognosis, of, perio, endo, lesions, is, poor, non, dental, causes, of, toothache, are, much, less, common, as, compared, with, dental, causes, in, a, toothache, of, neurovascular, origin, pain, is, reported, in, the, teeth, in, conjunction, with, a, migraine, local, and, distant, structures, such, as, ear, brain, carotid, artery, or, heart, can, also, refer, pain, to, the, teeth, 80, 81, other, non, dental, causes, of, toothache, include, myofascial, pain, muscle, pain, and, angina, pectoris, which, classically, refers, pain, to, the, lower, jaw, very, rarely, toothache, can, be, psychogenic, in, origin, 57, 58, disorders, of, the, maxillary, sinus, can, be, referred, to, the, upper, back, teeth, the, posterior, middle, and, anterior, superior, alveolar, nerves, are, all, closely, associated, with, the, lining, of, the, sinus, the, bone, between, the, floor, of, the, maxillary, sinus, and, the, roots, of, the, upper, back, teeth, is, very, thin, and, frequently, the, apices, of, these, teeth, disrupt, the, contour, of, the, sinus, floor, consequently, acute, or, chronic, maxillary, sinusitis, can, be, perceived, as, maxillary, toothache, and, neoplasms, of, the, sinus, such, as, adenoid, cystic, carcinoma, 390, can, cause, similarly, perceived, toothache, if, malignant, invasion, of, the, superior, alveolar, nerves, occurs, 72, classically, sinusitis, pain, increases, upon, valsalva, maneuvers, or, tilting, the, head, forward, painful, conditions, which, do, not, originate, from, the, teeth, or, their, supporting, structures, may, affect, the, oral, mucosa, of, the, gums, and, be, interpreted, by, the, individual, as, toothache, examples, include, neoplasms, of, the, gingival, or, alveolar, mucosa, usually, squamous, cell, carcinoma, 299, conditions, which, cause, gingivostomatitis, and, desquamative, gingivitis, various, conditions, may, involve, the, alveolar, bone, and, cause, non, odontogenic, toothache, such, as, burkitt, s, lymphoma, 340, infarcts, in, the, jaws, caused, by, sickle, cell, disease, 214, and, osteomyelitis, 497, various, conditions, of, the, trigeminal, nerve, can, masquerade, as, toothache, including, trigeminal, zoster, maxillary, or, mandibular, division, 487, trigeminal, neuralgia, cluster, headache, and, trigeminal, neuropathies, very, rarely, a, brain, tumor, might, cause, toothache, 80, 81, another, chronic, facial, pain, syndrome, which, can, mimic, toothache, is, temporomandibular, disorder, temporomandibular, joint, pain, dysfunction, syndrome, which, is, very, common, toothache, which, has, no, identifiable, dental, or, medical, cause, is, often, termed, atypical, odontalgia, which, in, turn, is, usually, considered, a, type, of, atypical, facial, pain, or, persistent, idiopathic, facial, pain, atypical, odontalgia, may, give, very, unusual, symptoms, such, as, pain, which, migrates, from, one, tooth, to, another, and, which, crosses, anatomical, boundaries, such, as, from, the, left, teeth, to, the, right, teeth, a, tooth, is, composed, of, an, outer, shell, of, calcified, hard, tissues, from, hardest, to, softest, enamel, dentin, and, cementum, and, an, inner, soft, tissue, core, the, pulp, system, which, contains, nerves, and, blood, vessels, the, visible, parts, of, the, teeth, in, the, mouth, the, crowns, covered, by, enamel, are, anchored, into, the, bone, by, the, roots, covered, by, cementum, underneath, the, cementum, and, enamel, layers, dentin, forms, the, bulk, of, the, tooth, and, surrounds, the, pulp, system, the, part, of, the, pulp, inside, the, crown, is, the, pulp, chamber, and, the, central, soft, tissue, nutrient, canals, within, each, root, are, root, canals, exiting, through, one, or, more, holes, at, the, root, end, apical, foramen, foramina, the, periodontal, ligament, connects, the, roots, to, the, bony, socket, the, gingiva, covers, the, alveolar, processes, the, tooth, bearing, arches, of, the, jaws, 1, 5, enamel, is, not, a, vital, tissue, as, it, lacks, blood, vessels, nerves, and, living, cells, consequently, pathologic, processes, involving, only, enamel, such, as, shallow, cavities, or, cracks, tend, to, be, painless, dentin, contains, many, microscopic, tubes, containing, fluid, and, the, processes, of, odontoblast, cells, which, communicate, with, the, pulp, mechanical, osmotic, or, other, stimuli, cause, movement, of, this, fluid, triggering, nerves, in, the, pulp, the, hydrodynamic, theory, of, pulp, sensitivity, due, to, the, close, relationship, between, dentin, and, pulp, they, are, frequently, considered, together, as, the, dentin, pulp, complex, 118, the, teeth, and, gums, exhibit, normal, sensations, in, health, such, sensations, are, generally, sharp, lasting, as, long, as, the, stimulus, there, is, a, continuous, spectrum, from, physiologic, sensation, to, pain, in, disease, pain, is, an, unpleasant, sensation, caused, by, intense, or, damaging, events, in, a, toothache, nerves, are, stimulated, by, either, exogenous, sources, for, instance, bacterial, toxins, metabolic, byproducts, chemicals, or, trauma, or, endogenous, factors, such, as, inflammatory, mediators, 532, 534, the, pain, pathway, is, mostly, transmitted, via, myelinated, a, sharp, or, stabbing, pain, and, unmyelinated, c, nerve, fibers, slow, dull, aching, or, burning, pain, of, the, trigeminal, nerve, which, supplies, sensation, to, the, teeth, and, gums, via, many, divisions, and, branches, initially, pain, is, felt, while, noxious, stimuli, are, applied, such, as, cold, continued, exposure, decreases, firing, thresholds, of, the, nerves, allowing, normally, non, painful, stimuli, to, trigger, pain, allodynia, should, the, insult, continue, noxious, stimuli, produce, larger, discharges, in, the, nerve, perceived, as, more, intense, pain, spontaneous, pain, may, occur, if, the, firing, threshold, is, decreased, so, it, can, fire, without, stimulus, hyperalgesia, the, physical, component, of, pain, is, processed, in, the, medullary, spinal, cord, and, perceived, in, the, frontal, cortex, because, pain, perception, involves, overlapping, sensory, systems, and, an, emotional, component, individual, responses, to, identical, stimuli, are, variable, 474, 475, the, diagnosis, of, toothache, can, be, challenging, 80, 81, not, only, because, the, list, of, potential, causes, is, extensive, but, also, because, dental, pain, may, be, extremely, variable, 975, and, pain, can, be, referred, to, and, from, the, teeth, dental, pain, can, simulate, virtually, any, facial, pain, syndrome, however, the, vast, majority, of, toothache, is, caused, by, dental, rather, than, non, dental, sources, 40, consequently, the, saying, horses, not, zebras, has, been, applied, to, the, differential, diagnosis, of, orofacial, pain, that, is, everyday, dental, causes, such, as, pulpitis, should, always, be, considered, before, unusual, non, dental, causes, such, as, myocardial, infarction, in, the, wider, context, of, orofacial, pain, all, cases, of, orofacial, pain, may, be, considered, as, having, a, dental, origin, until, proven, otherwise, 975, the, diagnostic, approach, for, toothache, is, generally, carried, out, in, the, following, sequence, history, followed, by, examination, and, investigations, all, this, information, is, then, collated, and, used, to, build, a, clinical, picture, and, a, differential, diagnosis, can, be, carried, out, the, chief, complaint, and, the, onset, of, the, complaint, are, usually, important, in, the, diagnosis, of, toothache, for, example, the, key, distinction, between, reversible, and, irreversible, pulpitis, is, given, in, the, history, such, as, pain, following, a, stimulus, in, the, former, and, lingering, pain, following, a, stimulus, and, spontaneous, pain, in, the, latter, history, is, also, important, in, recent, filling, or, other, dental, treatment, and, trauma, to, the, teeth, based, on, the, most, common, causes, of, toothache, dentin, hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and, pulpitis, the, key, indicators, become, localization, of, the, pain, whether, the, pain, is, perceived, as, originating, in, a, specific, tooth, thermal, sensitivity, pain, on, biting, spontaneity, of, the, pain, and, factors, that, make, the, pain, worse, 50, the, various, qualities, of, the, toothache, such, as, the, effect, of, biting, and, chewing, on, the, pain, the, effect, of, thermal, stimuli, and, the, effect, of, the, pain, on, sleep, are, verbally, established, by, the, clinician, usually, in, a, systematic, fashion, such, as, using, the, socrates, pain, assessment, method, see, table, 2, 9, from, the, history, indicators, of, pulpal, periodontal, a, combination, of, both, or, non, dental, causes, can, be, observed, periodontal, pain, is, frequently, localized, to, a, particular, tooth, which, is, made, much, worse, by, biting, on, the, tooth, sudden, in, onset, and, associated, with, bleeding, and, pain, when, brushing, more, than, one, factor, may, be, involved, in, the, toothache, for, example, a, pulpal, abscess, which, is, typically, severe, spontaneous, and, localized, can, cause, periapical, periodontitis, which, results, in, pain, on, biting, cracked, tooth, syndrome, may, also, cause, a, combination, of, symptoms, lateral, periodontitis, which, is, usually, without, any, thermal, sensitivity, and, sensitive, to, biting, can, cause, pulpitis, and, the, tooth, becomes, sensitive, to, cold, 2, 9, non, dental, sources, of, pain, often, cause, multiple, teeth, to, hurt, and, have, an, epicenter, that, is, either, above, or, below, the, jaws, for, instance, cardiac, pain, which, can, make, the, bottom, teeth, hurt, usually, radiates, up, from, the, chest, and, neck, and, sinusitis, which, can, make, the, back, top, teeth, hurt, is, worsened, by, bending, over, 56, 61, as, all, of, these, conditions, may, mimic, toothache, it, is, possible, that, dental, treatment, such, as, fillings, root, canal, treatment, or, tooth, extraction, may, be, carried, out, unnecessarily, by, dentists, in, an, attempt, to, relieve, the, individual, s, pain, and, as, a, result, the, correct, diagnosis, is, delayed, a, hallmark, is, that, there, is, no, obvious, dental, cause, and, signs, and, symptoms, elsewhere, in, the, body, may, be, present, as, migraines, are, typically, present, for, many, years, the, diagnosis, is, easier, to, make, often, the, character, of, the, pain, is, the, differentiator, between, dental, and, non, dental, pain, irreversible, pulpitis, progresses, to, pulp, necrosis, wherein, the, nerves, are, non, functional, and, a, pain, free, period, following, the, severe, pain, of, irreversible, pulpitis, may, be, experienced, however, it, is, common, for, irreversible, pulpitis, to, progress, to, apical, periodontitis, including, an, acute, apical, abscess, without, treatment, as, irreversible, pulpitis, generates, an, apical, abscess, the, character, of, the, toothache, may, simply, change, without, any, pain, free, period, for, instance, the, pain, becomes, well, localized, and, biting, on, the, tooth, becomes, painful, hot, drinks, can, make, the, tooth, feel, worse, because, they, expand, the, gases, and, likewise, cold, can, make, it, feel, better, thus, some, will, sip, cold, water, the, clinical, examination, narrows, the, source, down, to, a, specific, tooth, teeth, or, a, non, dental, cause, clinical, examination, moves, from, the, outside, to, the, inside, and, from, the, general, to, the, specific, outside, of, the, mouth, the, sinuses, muscles, of, the, face, and, neck, the, temporomandibular, joints, and, cervical, lymph, nodes, are, palpated, for, pain, or, swelling, 9, in, the, mouth, the, soft, tissues, of, the, gingiva, mucosa, tongue, and, pharynx, are, examined, for, redness, swelling, or, deformity, finally, the, teeth, are, examined, each, tooth, that, may, be, painful, is, percussed, tapped, palpated, at, the, base, of, the, root, and, probed, with, a, dental, explorer, for, dental, caries, and, a, periodontal, probe, for, periodontitis, then, wiggled, for, mobility, 10, sometimes, the, symptoms, reported, in, the, history, are, misleading, and, point, the, examiner, to, the, wrong, area, of, the, mouth, for, instance, sometimes, people, may, mistake, pain, from, pulpitis, in, a, lower, tooth, as, pain, in, the, upper, teeth, and, vice, versa, in, other, instances, the, apparent, examination, findings, may, be, misleading, and, lead, to, the, wrong, diagnosis, and, wrong, treatment, pus, from, a, pericoronal, abscess, associated, with, a, lower, third, molar, may, drain, along, the, submucosal, plane, and, discharge, as, a, parulis, over, the, roots, of, the, teeth, towards, the, front, of, the, mouth, a, migratory, abscess, another, example, is, decay, of, the, tooth, root, which, is, hidden, from, view, below, the, gumline, giving, the, casual, appearance, of, a, sound, tooth, if, careful, periodontal, examination, is, not, carried, out, factors, indicating, infection, include, movement, of, fluid, in, the, tissues, during, palpation, fluctuance, swollen, lymph, nodes, in, the, neck, and, fever, with, an, oral, temperature, more, than, 37, 7, c, any, tooth, that, is, identified, in, either, the, history, of, pain, or, base, clinical, exam, as, a, source, for, toothache, may, undergo, further, testing, for, vitality, of, the, dental, pulp, infection, fractures, or, periodontitis, these, tests, may, include, 10, 19, less, commonly, used, tests, might, include, trans, illumination, to, detect, congestion, of, the, maxillary, sinus, or, to, highlight, a, crack, in, a, tooth, dyes, to, help, visualize, a, crack, a, test, cavity, selective, anaesthesia, and, laser, doppler, flowmetry, establishing, a, diagnosis, of, nondental, toothache, is, initially, done, by, careful, questioning, about, the, site, nature, aggravating, and, relieving, factors, and, referral, of, the, pain, then, ruling, out, any, dental, causes, there, are, no, specific, treatments, for, nondental, pain, each, treatment, is, directed, at, the, cause, of, the, pain, rather, than, the, toothache, itself, but, a, dentist, can, assist, in, offering, potential, sources, of, the, pain, and, direct, the, patient, to, appropriate, care, the, most, critical, nondental, source, is, the, radiation, of, angina, pectoris, into, the, lower, teeth, and, the, potential, need, for, urgent, cardiac, care, 68, when, it, becomes, extremely, painful, and, decayed, the, tooth, may, be, known, as, a, hot, tooth, since, most, toothache, is, the, result, of, plaque, related, diseases, such, as, tooth, decay, and, periodontal, disease, the, majority, of, cases, could, be, prevented, by, avoidance, of, a, cariogenic, diet, and, maintenance, of, good, oral, hygiene, that, is, reduction, in, the, number, times, that, refined, sugars, are, consumed, per, day, and, brushing, the, teeth, twice, a, day, with, fluoride, toothpaste, and, interdental, cleaning, regular, visits, to, a, dentist, also, increases, the, likelihood, that, problems, are, detected, early, and, averted, before, toothache, occurs, dental, trauma, could, also, be, significantly, reduced, by, routine, use, of, mouthguards, in, contact, sports, there, are, many, causes, of, toothache, and, its, diagnosis, is, a, specialist, topic, meaning, that, attendance, at, a, dentist, is, usually, required, since, many, cases, of, toothache, are, inflammatory, in, nature, over, the, counter, non, steroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, nsaids, may, help, unless, contraindicated, such, as, with, a, peptic, ulcer, generally, nsaids, are, as, effective, as, aspirin, alone, or, in, combination, with, codeine, 41, 43, however, simple, analgesics, may, have, little, effect, on, some, causes, of, toothache, and, the, severe, pain, can, drive, individuals, to, exceed, the, maximum, dose, for, example, when, acetaminophen, paracetamol, is, taken, for, toothache, an, accidental, overdose, is, more, likely, to, occur, when, compared, to, people, who, are, taking, acetaminophen, for, other, reasons, another, risk, in, persons, with, toothache, is, a, painful, chemical, burn, of, the, oral, mucosa, caused, by, holding, a, caustic, substance, such, as, aspirin, tablets, and, toothache, remedies, containing, eugenol, such, as, clove, oil, against, the, gum, although, the, logic, of, placing, a, tablet, against, the, painful, tooth, is, understandable, an, aspirin, tablet, needs, to, be, swallowed, to, have, any, pain, killing, effect, caustic, toothache, remedies, require, careful, application, to, the, tooth, only, without, coming, into, excessive, contact, with, the, soft, tissues, of, the, mouth, for, the, dentist, the, goal, of, treatment, generally, is, to, relieve, the, pain, and, wherever, possible, to, preserve, or, restore, function, the, treatment, depends, on, the, cause, of, the, toothache, and, frequently, a, clinical, decision, regarding, the, current, state, and, long, term, prognosis, of, the, affected, tooth, as, well, as, the, individual, s, wishes, and, ability, to, cope, with, dental, treatment, will, influence, the, treatment, choice, often, administration, of, an, intra, oral, local, anesthetic, such, as, lidocaine, and, epinephrine, is, indicated, in, order, to, carry, out, pain, free, treatment, treatment, may, range, from, simple, advice, removal, of, dental, decay, with, a, dental, drill, and, subsequent, placement, of, a, filling, to, root, canal, treatment, tooth, extraction, or, debridement, in, pulpitis, an, important, distinction, in, regard, to, treatment, is, whether, the, inflammation, is, reversible, or, irreversible, treatment, of, reversible, pulpitis, is, by, removing, or, correcting, the, causative, factor, usually, the, decay, is, removed, and, a, sedative, dressing, is, used, to, encourage, the, pulp, to, return, to, a, state, of, health, 41, either, as, a, base, underneath, a, permanent, filling, or, as, a, temporary, filling, intended, to, last, for, a, period, while, the, tooth, is, observed, to, see, if, pulpitis, resolves, irreversible, pulpitis, and, its, sequalae, pulp, necrosis, and, apical, periodontitis, require, treatment, with, root, canal, therapy, or, tooth, extraction, as, the, pulp, acts, as, a, nidus, of, infection, which, will, lead, to, a, chronic, infection, if, not, removed, generally, there, is, no, difference, in, outcomes, between, whether, the, root, canal, treatment, is, completed, in, one, or, multiple, appointments, the, field, of, regenerative, endodontics, is, now, developing, ways, to, clean, the, pulp, chamber, and, regenerate, the, soft, and, hard, tissues, to, either, regrow, or, simulate, pulp, structure, this, has, proved, especially, helpful, in, children, where, the, tooth, root, has, not, yet, finished, developing, and, root, canal, treatments, have, lower, success, rates, 602, 618, reversible, irreversible, pulpitis, is, a, distinct, concept, from, whether, the, tooth, is, restorable, or, unrestorable, e, g, a, tooth, may, only, have, reversible, pulpitis, but, has, been, structurally, weakened, by, decay, or, trauma, to, the, point, that, it, is, impossible, to, restore, the, tooth, in, the, long, term, a, general, principle, concerning, dental, abscesses, is, ubi, pus, ibi, evacua, where, there, is, pus, drain, it, which, applies, to, any, case, where, there, is, a, collection, of, pus, in, the, tissues, such, as, a, periodontal, abscess, pericoronal, abscess, or, apical, abscess, the, pus, within, the, abscess, is, under, pressure, and, the, surrounding, tissues, are, deformed, and, stretched, to, accommodate, the, swelling, this, leads, to, a, sensation, of, throbbing, often, in, time, with, the, pulse, and, constant, pain, pus, may, be, evacuated, via, the, tooth, by, drilling, into, the, pulp, chamber, an, endodontic, access, cavity, such, a, treatment, is, sometimes, termed, open, drainage, drainage, can, also, be, performed, via, the, tooth, socket, once, the, causative, tooth, is, extracted, if, neither, of, those, measures, succeeds, or, they, are, impossible, incision, and, drainage, may, be, required, in, which, a, small, incision, is, made, in, the, soft, tissues, directly, over, the, abscess, at, the, most, dependent, point, a, surgical, instrument, such, as, a, pair, of, tweezers, is, gently, inserted, into, the, incision, and, opened, while, the, abscess, is, massaged, to, encourage, the, pus, to, drain, out, usually, the, reduction, in, pain, when, the, pus, drains, is, immediate, and, marked, as, the, built, up, pressure, is, relieved, if, the, pus, drains, into, the, mouth, there, is, usually, a, bad, or, offensive, taste, antibiotics, tend, to, be, extensively, used, for, emergency, dental, problems, as, samples, for, microbiologic, culture, and, sensitivity, are, hardly, ever, carried, out, in, general, dental, practice, broad, spectrum, antibiotics, such, as, amoxicillin, are, typically, used, for, a, short, course, of, about, three, to, seven, days, antibiotics, are, seen, as, a, quick, fix, by, both, dentists, who, generally, only, have, a, very, short, time, to, manage, dental, emergencies, and, by, patients, who, tend, to, want, to, avoid, treatments, such, as, tooth, extraction, which, are, perceived, negatively, however, antibiotics, typically, only, temporarily, suppress, an, infection, and, the, need, for, definitive, treatment, is, only, postponed, for, an, unpredictable, length, of, time, an, estimated, 10, of, all, antibiotic, prescriptions, are, made, by, dentists, a, major, factor, in, antibiotic, resistance, they, are, often, used, inappropriately, in, conditions, for, which, they, are, ineffective, or, their, risks, outweigh, the, benefits, such, as, irreversible, pulpitis, apical, abscess, 303, dry, socket, 303, or, mild, pericoronitis, 303, however, the, reality, is, that, antibiotics, are, rarely, needed, 230, and, they, should, be, used, restrictively, in, dentistry, 164, local, measures, such, as, incision, and, drainage, and, removal, of, the, cause, of, the, infection, such, as, a, necrotic, tooth, pulp, have, a, greater, therapeutic, benefit, and, are, much, more, important, 230, if, abscess, drainage, has, been, achieved, antibiotics, are, not, usually, necessary, 303, antibiotics, tend, to, be, used, when, local, measures, cannot, be, carried, out, immediately, 303, in, this, role, antibiotics, suppress, the, infection, until, local, measures, can, be, carried, out, severe, trismus, may, occur, in, when, the, muscles, of, mastication, are, involved, in, an, odontogenic, infection, making, any, surgical, treatment, impossible, immunocompromised, individuals, are, less, able, to, fight, off, infections, and, antibiotics, are, usually, given, 232, evidence, of, systemic, involvement, such, as, a, fever, higher, than, 38, 5, c, cervical, lymphadenopathy, or, malaise, also, indicates, antibiotic, therapy, as, do, rapidly, spreading, infections, cellulitis, or, severe, pericoronitis, 303, 232, drooling, and, difficulty, swallowing, are, signs, that, the, airway, may, be, threatened, and, may, precede, difficulty, in, breathing, ludwig, s, angina, and, cavernous, sinus, thrombosis, are, rare, but, serious, complications, of, odontogenic, infections, severe, infections, tend, to, be, managed, in, hospital, most, dental, pain, can, be, treated, with, routine, dentistry, in, rare, cases, toothache, can, be, a, symptom, representing, a, life, threatening, condition, such, as, a, deep, neck, infection, compression, of, the, airway, by, a, spreading, odontogenic, infection, or, something, more, remote, like, a, heart, attack, dental, caries, if, left, untreated, follows, a, predictable, natural, history, as, it, nears, the, pulp, of, the, tooth, first, it, causes, reversible, pulpitis, which, transitions, to, irreversible, pulpitis, then, to, necrosis, then, to, necrosis, with, periapical, periodontitis, and, finally, to, necrosis, with, periapical, abscess, reversible, pulpitis, can, be, stopped, by, removal, of, the, cavity, and, the, placement, of, a, sedative, dressing, of, any, part, of, the, cavity, that, is, near, the, pulp, chamber, irreversible, pulpitis, and, pulp, necrosis, are, treated, with, either, root, canal, therapy, or, extraction, infection, of, the, periapical, tissue, will, generally, resolve, with, the, treatment, of, the, pulp, unless, it, has, expanded, to, cellulitis, or, a, radicular, cyst, the, success, rate, of, restorative, treatment, and, sedative, dressings, in, reversible, pulpitis, depends, on, the, extent, of, the, disease, as, well, as, several, technical, factors, such, as, the, sedative, agent, used, and, whether, a, rubber, dam, was, used, the, success, rate, of, root, canal, treatment, also, depends, on, the, degree, of, disease, root, canal, therapy, for, irreversible, pulpitis, has, a, generally, higher, success, rate, than, necrosis, with, periapical, abscess, and, many, other, technical, factors, 77, 82, in, the, united, states, an, estimated, 12, of, people, reported, that, they, had, a, toothache, at, some, point, in, the, six, months, before, questioning, 40, individuals, aged, 18, 34, reported, much, higher, rates, toothache, than, those, aged, 75, or, over, 6, in, a, survey, of, australian, schoolchildren, 12, had, experienced, toothache, before, the, age, of, five, and, 32, by, the, age, of, 12, 6, dental, trauma, is, extremely, common, and, tends, to, occur, more, often, in, children, than, adults, toothache, may, occur, at, any, age, in, any, gender, and, in, any, geographic, region, diagnosing, and, relieving, toothache, is, considered, one, of, the, main, responsibilities, of, dentists, irreversible, pulpitis, is, thought, to, be, the, most, common, reason, that, people, seek, emergency, dental, treatment, since, dental, caries, associated, with, pulpitis, is, the, most, common, cause, toothache, is, more, common, in, populations, that, are, at, higher, risk, of, dental, caries, the, prevalence, of, caries, in, a, population, is, dependent, upon, factors, such, as, diet, refined, sugars, socioeconomic, status, and, exposure, to, fluoride, such, as, areas, without, water, fluoridation, 6, the, first, known, mention, of, tooth, decay, and, toothache, occurs, on, a, sumerian, clay, tablet, now, referred, to, as, the, legend, of, the, worm, it, was, written, in, cuneiform, recovered, from, the, euphrates, valley, and, dates, from, around, 5000, bc, the, belief, that, tooth, decay, and, dental, pain, is, caused, by, tooth, worms, is, found, in, ancient, india, egypt, japan, and, china, and, persists, until, the, age, of, enlightenment, although, toothache, is, an, ancient, problem, 48, 52, it, is, thought, that, ancient, people, suffered, less, dental, decay, due, to, a, lack, of, refined, sugars, in, their, diet, on, the, other, hand, diets, were, frequently, coarser, leading, to, more, tooth, wear, for, example, hypotheses, hold, that, ancient, egyptians, had, a, lot, of, tooth, wear, due, to, desert, sand, blown, on, the, wind, mixing, with, the, dough, of, their, bread, the, ancient, egyptians, also, wore, amulets, to, prevent, toothache, the, ebers, papyrus, 1500, bc, details, a, recipe, to, treat, gnawing, of, the, blood, in, the, tooth, which, included, fruit, of, the, gebu, plant, onion, cake, and, dough, to, be, chewed, for, four, days, 48, 52, archigenes, of, apamea, describes, use, of, a, mouthwash, made, by, boiling,

were, smashed, she, was, threatened, with, being, burned, alive, unless, she, renounced, christianity, but, she, instead, chose, to, throw, herself, onto, the, fire, supposedly, toothache, sufferers, who, invoke, her, name, will, find, relief, in, the, 15th, century, priest, physician, andrew, boorde, describes, a, deworming, technique, for, the, teeth, and, if, it, do, come, by, worms, make, a, candle, of, wax, with, henbane, seeds, and, light, it, and, let, the, perfume, of, the, candle, enter, into, the, tooth, and, gape, over, a, dish, of, cold, water, and, then, you, may, take, the,

again, feeling, or, causing, pain, 48, 52, in, the, elizabethan, era, toothache, was, an, ailment, associated, with, lovers, as, in, massinger, and, fletcher, s, play, the, false, one, toothache, also, appears, in, a, number, of, william, shakespeare, s, plays, such, as, othello, and, cymbeline, in, much, ado, about, nothing, act, iii, scene, 2, when, asked, by, his, companions, why, he, is, feeling, sad, a, character, replies, that, he, has, toothache, so, as, not, to, admit, the, truth, that, he, is, in, love, there, is, reference, to, toothworm, as, the, cause, of, toothache, and, to, tooth, extraction, as, a, cure, draw, it, in, act, v, scene, 1, another, character, remarks, for, there, was, never, yet, philosopher, that, could, endure, the, toothache, patiently, in, modern,

effect, the, character, is, rebuking, his, friend, for, trying, to, make, him, feel, better, with, philosophical, platitudes, the, scottish, poet, robert, burns, wrote, address, to, the, toothache, in, 1786, inspired, after, he, suffered, from, it, the, poem, elaborates, on, the, severity, of, toothache, describing, it, as, the, hell, o, a, diseases, hell, of, all, diseases, a, number, of,
