for, prehistoric, genera, see, list, of, penguins, fossil, genera, penguins, are, a, group, of, aquatic, flightless, birds, from, the, family, spheniscidae, s, f, n, s, d, i, d, a, of, the, order, sphenisciformes, s, f, n, s, f, r, m, i, z, they, live, almost, exclusively, in, the, southern, hemisphere, only, one, species, the, gal, pagos, penguin, is, found, north, of, the, equator, highly, adapted, for, life, in, the, ocean, water, penguins, have, countershaded, dark, and, white, plumage, and, flippers, for, swimming, most, penguins, feed, on, krill, fish, squid, and, other, forms, of, sea, life, which, they, catch, with, their, bills, and, swallow, whole, while, swimming, a, penguin, has, a, spiny, tongue, and, powerful, jaws, to, grip, slippery, prey, they, spend, about, half, of, their, lives, on, land, and, the, other, half, in, the, sea, the, largest, living, species, is, the, emperor, penguin, aptenodytes, forsteri, on, average, adults, are, about, 1, 1, m, 3, ft, 7, in, tall, and, weigh, 35, kg, 77, lb, the, smallest, penguin, species, is, the, little, blue, penguin, eudyptula, minor, also, known, as, the, fairy, penguin, which, stands, around, 30, 33, cm, 12, 13, in, tall, and, weighs, 1, 2, 1, 3, kg, 2, 6, 2, 9, lb, today, larger, penguins, generally, inhabit, colder, regions, and, smaller, penguins, inhabit, regions, with, temperate, or, tropical, climates, some, prehistoric, penguin, species, were, enormous, as, tall, or, heavy, as, an, adult, human, there, was, a, great, diversity, of, species, in, subantarctic, regions, and, at, least, one, giant, species, in, a, region, around, 2, 000, km, south, of, the, equator, 35, mya, during, the, late, eocene, a, climate, decidedly, warmer, than, today, the, word, penguin, first, appears, in, literature, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, as, a, synonym, for, the, great, auk, when, european, explorers, discovered, what, are, today, known, as, penguins, in, the, southern, hemisphere, they, noticed, their, similar, appearance, to, the, great, auk, of, the, northern, hemisphere, and, named, them, after, this, bird, although, they, are, not, closely, related, the, etymology, of, the, word, penguin, is, still, debated, the, english, word, is, not, apparently, of, french, breton, or, spanish, origin, the, latter, two, are, attributed, to, the, french, word, pingouin, but, first, appears, in, english, or, dutch, some, dictionaries, suggest, a, derivation, from, welsh, pen, head, and, gwyn, white, including, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, american, heritage, dictionary, the, century, dictionary, and, merriam, webster, on, the, basis, that, the, name, was, originally, applied, to, the, great, auk, either, because, it, was, found, on, white, head, island, welsh, pen, gwyn, in, newfoundland, or, because, it, had, white, circles, around, its, eyes, though, the, head, was, black, an, alternative, etymology, links, the, word, to, latin, pinguis, which, means, fat, or, oil, support, for, this, etymology, can, be, found, in, the, alternative, germanic, word, for, penguin, fettgans, or, fat, goose, and, the, related, dutch, word, vetgans, adult, male, penguins, are, sometimes, called, cocks, females, sometimes, called, hens, a, group, of, penguins, on, land, is, a, waddle, and, a, group, of, penguins, in, the, water, is, a, raft, since, 1871, the, latin, word, pinguinus, has, been, used, in, scientific, classification, to, name, the, genus, of, the, great, auk, pinguinus, impennis, meaning, plump, or, fat, without, flight, feathers, which, became, extinct, in, the, mid, 19th, century, as, confirmed, by, a, 2004, genetic, study, the, genus, pinguinus, belongs, in, the, family, of, the, auks, alcidae, within, the, order, of, the, charadriiformes, the, birds, currently, known, as, penguins, were, discovered, later, and, were, so, named, by, sailors, because, of, their, physical, resemblance, to, the, great, auk, despite, this, resemblance, however, they, are, not, auks, and, are, not, closely, related, to, the, great, auk, they, do, not, belong, in, the, genus, pinguinus, and, are, not, classified, in, the, same, family, and, order, as, the, great, auk, they, were, classified, in, 1831, by, charles, lucien, bonaparte, in, several, distinct, genera, within, the, family, spheniscidae, and, order, sphenisciformes, the, family, name, of, spheniscidae, was, given, by, charles, lucien, bonaparte, from, the, genus, spheniscus, the, name, of, that, genus, comes, from, the, greek, word, sph, n, wedge, used, for, the, shape, of, an, african, penguin, s, swimming, flippers, some, recent, sources, apply, the, phylogenetic, taxon, spheniscidae, to, what, here, is, referred, to, as, spheniscinae, furthermore, they, restrict, the, phylogenetic, taxon, sphenisciformes, to, flightless, taxa, and, establish, the, phylogenetic, taxon, pansphenisciformes, as, equivalent, to, the, linnean, taxon, sphenisciformes, i, e, including, any, flying, basal, proto, penguins, to, be, discovered, eventually, given, that, neither, the, relationships, of, the, penguin, subfamilies, to, each, other, nor, the, placement, of, the, penguins, in, the, avian, phylogeny, is, presently, resolved, this, is, confusing, so, the, established, linnean, system, is, followed, here, although, the, evolutionary, and, biogeographic, history, of, sphenisciformes, is, well, researched, many, prehistoric, forms, are, not, fully, described, some, seminal, articles, about, the, evolutionary, history, of, penguins, have, been, published, since, 2005, the, basal, penguins, lived, around, the, time, of, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, in, the, general, area, of, southern, new, zealand, and, byrd, land, antarctica, due, to, plate, tectonics, these, areas, were, at, that, time, less, than, 1, 500, kilometres, 930, mi, apart, rather, than, 4, 000, kilometres, 2, 500, mi, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, penguins, and, procellariiformes, can, be, roughly, dated, to, the, campanian, maastrichtian, boundary, around, 70, 68, mya, the, oldest, known, fossil, penguin, species, is, waimanu, manneringi, which, lived, 62, mya, in, new, zealand, while, they, were, not, as, well, adapted, to, aquatic, life, as, modern, penguins, waimanu, were, flightless, with, short, wings, adapted, for, deep, diving, they, swam, on, the, surface, using, mainly, their, feet, but, the, wings, were, as, opposed, to, most, other, diving, birds, both, living, and, extinct, already, adapting, to, underwater, locomotion, perudyptes, from, northern, peru, was, dated, to, 42, mya, an, unnamed, fossil, from, argentina, proves, that, by, the, bartonian, middle, eocene, some, 39, 38, mya, primitive, penguins, had, spread, to, south, america, and, were, in, the, process, of, expanding, into, atlantic, waters, during, the, late, eocene, and, the, early, oligocene, 40, 30, mya, some, lineages, of, gigantic, penguins, existed, nordenskjoeld, s, giant, penguin, was, the, tallest, growing, nearly, 1, 80, meters, 5, 9, feet, tall, the, new, zealand, giant, penguin, was, probably, the, heaviest, weighing, 80, kilograms, 180, lb, or, more, both, were, found, on, new, zealand, the, former, also, in, the, antarctic, farther, eastwards, traditionally, most, extinct, species, of, penguins, giant, or, small, had, been, placed, in, the, paraphyletic, subfamily, called, palaeeudyptinae, more, recently, with, new, taxa, being, discovered, and, placed, in, the, phylogeny, if, possible, it, is, becoming, accepted, that, there, were, at, least, two, major, extinct, lineages, one, or, two, closely, related, ones, occurred, in, patagonia, and, at, least, one, other, which, is, or, includes, the, paleeudyptines, as, recognized, today, occurred, on, most, antarctic, and, subantarctic, coasts, size, plasticity, was, significant, at, this, initial, stage, of, radiation, on, seymour, island, antarctica, for, example, around, 10, known, species, of, penguins, ranging, in, size, from, medium, to, large, apparently, coexisted, some, 35, mya, during, the, priabonian, late, eocene, it, is, not, known, whether, the, palaeeudyptines, constitute, a, monophyletic, lineage, or, whether, gigantism, was, evolved, independently, in, a, restricted, palaeeudyptinae, and, the, anthropornithinae, whether, they, were, considered, valid, or, whether, there, was, a, wide, size, range, present, in, the, palaeeudyptinae, as, delimited, i, e, including, anthropornis, nordenskjoeldi, the, oldest, well, described, giant, penguin, the, 5, foot, 1, 5, m, tall, icadyptes, salasi, existed, as, far, north, as, northern, peru, about, 36, mya, gigantic, penguins, had, disappeared, by, the, end, of, the, paleogene, around, 25, mya, their, decline, and, disappearance, coincided, with, the, spread, of, the, squalodontidae, and, other, primitive, fish, eating, toothed, whales, which, competed, with, them, for, food, and, were, ultimately, more, successful, a, new, lineage, the, paraptenodytes, which, includes, smaller, and, stout, legged, forms, had, already, arisen, in, southernmost, south, america, by, that, time, the, early, neogene, saw, the, emergence, of, another, morphotype, in, the, same, area, the, similarly, sized, but, more, gracile, palaeospheniscinae, as, well, as, the, radiation, that, gave, rise, to, the, current, biodiversity, of, penguins, modern, penguins, constitute, two, undisputed, clades, and, another, two, more, basal, genera, with, more, ambiguous, relationships, to, help, resolve, the, evolution, of, this, order, 19, high, coverage, genomes, that, together, with, two, previously, published, genomes, encompass, all, extant, penguin, species, have, been, sequenced, the, origin, of, the, spheniscinae, lies, probably, in, the, latest, paleogene, and, geographically, it, must, have, been, much, the, same, as, the, general, area, in, which, the, order, evolved, the, oceans, between, the, australia, new, zealand, region, and, the, antarctic, presumably, diverging, from, other, penguins, around, 40, mya, it, seems, that, the, spheniscinae, were, for, quite, some, time, limited, to, their, ancestral, area, as, the, well, researched, deposits, of, the, antarctic, peninsula, and, patagonia, have, not, yielded, paleogene, fossils, of, the, subfamily, also, the, earliest, spheniscine, lineages, are, those, with, the, most, southern, distribution, the, genus, aptenodytes, appears, to, be, the, basalmost, divergence, among, living, penguins, they, have, bright, yellow, orange, neck, breast, and, bill, patches, incubate, by, placing, their, eggs, on, their, feet, and, when, they, hatch, the, chicks, are, almost, naked, this, genus, has, a, distribution, centred, on, the, antarctic, coasts, and, barely, extends, to, some, subantarctic, islands, today, pygoscelis, contains, species, with, a, fairly, simple, black, and, white, head, pattern, their, distribution, is, intermediate, centred, on, antarctic, coasts, but, extending, somewhat, northwards, from, there, in, external, morphology, these, apparently, still, resemble, the, common, ancestor, of, the, spheniscinae, as, aptenodytes, autapomorphies, are, in, most, cases, fairly, pronounced, adaptations, related, to, that, genus, extreme, habitat, conditions, as, the, former, genus, pygoscelis, seems, to, have, diverged, during, the, bartonian, but, the, range, expansion, and, radiation, that, led, to, the, present, day, diversity, probably, did, not, occur, until, much, later, around, the, burdigalian, stage, of, the, early, miocene, roughly, 20, 15, mya, the, genera, spheniscus, and, eudyptula, contain, species, with, a, mostly, subantarctic, distribution, centred, on, south, america, some, however, range, quite, far, northwards, they, all, lack, carotenoid, colouration, and, the, former, genus, has, a, conspicuous, banded, head, pattern, they, are, unique, among, living, penguins, by, nesting, in, burrows, this, group, probably, radiated, eastwards, with, the, antarctic, circumpolar, current, out, of, the, ancestral, range, of, modern, penguins, throughout, the, chattian, late, oligocene, starting, approximately, 28, mya, while, the, two, genera, separated, during, this, time, the, present, day, diversity, is, the, result, of, a, pliocene, radiation, taking, place, some, 4, 2, mya, the, megadyptes, eudyptes, clade, occurs, at, similar, latitudes, though, not, as, far, north, as, the, gal, pagos, penguin, has, its, highest, diversity, in, the, new, zealand, region, and, represents, a, westward, dispersal, they, are, characterized, by, hairy, yellow, ornamental, head, feathers, their, bills, are, at, least, partly, red, these, two, genera, diverged, apparently, in, the, middle, miocene, langhian, roughly, 15, 14, mya, although, the, living, species, of, eudyptes, are, the, product, of, a, later, radiation, stretching, from, about, the, late, tortonian, late, miocene, 8, mya, to, the, end, of, the, pliocene, the, geographical, and, temporal, pattern, of, spheniscine, evolution, corresponds, closely, to, two, episodes, of, global, cooling, documented, in, the, paleoclimatic, record, the, emergence, of, the, subantarctic, lineage, at, the, end, of, the, bartonian, corresponds, with, the, onset, of, the, slow, period, of, cooling, that, eventually, led, to, the, ice, ages, some, 35, million, years, later, with, habitat, on, the, antarctic, coasts, declining, by, the, priabonian, more, hospitable, conditions, for, most, penguins, existed, in, the, subantarctic, regions, rather, than, in, antarctica, itself, notably, the, cold, antarctic, circumpolar, current, also, started, as, a, continuous, circumpolar, flow, only, around, 30, mya, on, the, one, hand, forcing, the, antarctic, cooling, and, on, the, other, facilitating, the, eastward, expansion, of, spheniscus, to, south, america, and, eventually, beyond, despite, this, there, is, no, fossil, evidence, to, support, the, idea, of, crown, radiation, from, the, antarctic, continent, in, the, paleogene, although, dna, study, favors, such, a, radiation, later, an, interspersed, period, of, slight, warming, was, ended, by, the, middle, miocene, climate, transition, a, sharp, drop, in, global, average, temperature, from, 14, to, 12, mya, and, similar, abrupt, cooling, events, followed, at, 8, mya, and, 4, mya, by, the, end, of, the, tortonian, the, antarctic, ice, sheet, was, already, much, like, today, in, volume, and, extent, the, emergence, of, most, of, today, s, subantarctic, penguin, species, almost, certainly, was, caused, by, this, sequence, of, neogene, climate, shifts, penguin, ancestry, beyond, waimanu, remains, unknown, and, not, well, resolved, by, molecular, or, morphological, analyses, the, latter, tend, to, be, confounded, by, the, strong, adaptive, autapomorphies, of, the, sphenisciformes, a, sometimes, perceived, fairly, close, relationship, between, penguins, and, grebes, is, almost, certainly, an, error, based, on, both, groups, strong, diving, adaptations, which, are, homoplasies, on, the, other, hand, different, dna, sequence, datasets, do, not, agree, in, detail, with, each, other, either, what, seems, clear, is, that, penguins, belong, to, a, clade, of, neoaves, living, birds, except, for, paleognaths, and, fowl, that, comprises, what, is, sometimes, called, higher, waterbirds, to, distinguish, them, from, the, more, ancient, waterfowl, this, group, contains, such, birds, as, storks, rails, and, the, seabirds, with, the, possible, exception, of, the, charadriiformes, inside, this, group, penguin, relationships, are, far, less, clear, depending, on, the, analysis, and, dataset, a, close, relationship, to, ciconiiformes, or, to, procellariiformes, has, been, suggested, some, think, the, penguin, like, plotopterids, usually, considered, relatives, of, cormorants, and, anhingas, may, actually, be, a, sister, group, of, the, penguins, and, those, penguins, may, have, ultimately, shared, a, common, ancestor, with, the, pelecaniformes, and, consequently, would, have, to, be, included, in, that, order, or, that, the, plotopterids, were, not, as, close, to, other, pelecaniforms, as, generally, assumed, which, would, necessitate, splitting, the, traditional, pelecaniformes, into, three, a, 2014, analysis, of, whole, genomes, of, 48, representative, bird, species, has, concluded, that, penguins, are, the, sister, group, of, procellariiformes, from, which, they, diverged, about, 60, million, years, ago, 95, ci, 56, 8, 62, 7, the, distantly, related, puffins, which, live, in, the, north, pacific, and, north, atlantic, developed, similar, characteristics, to, survive, in, the, arctic, and, sub, arctic, environments, like, the, penguins, puffins, have, a, white, chest, black, back, and, short, stubby, wings, providing, excellent, swimming, ability, in, icy, water, but, unlike, penguins, puffins, can, fly, as, flightless, birds, would, not, survive, alongside, land, based, predators, such, as, polar, bears, and, foxes, there, are, no, such, predators, in, the, antarctic, their, similarities, indicate, that, similar, environments, although, at, great, distances, can, result, in, similar, evolutionary, developments, i, e, convergent, evolution, penguins, are, superbly, adapted, to, aquatic, life, their, wings, have, evolved, to, become, flippers, useless, for, flight, in, the, air, in, the, water, however, penguins, are, astonishingly, agile, penguins, swimming, looks, very, similar, to, birds, flight, in, the, air, within, the, smooth, plumage, a, layer, of, air, is, preserved, ensuring, buoyancy, the, air, layer, also, helps, insulate, the, birds, in, cold, waters, on, land, penguins, use, their, tails, and, wings, to, maintain, balance, for, their, upright, stance, all, penguins, are, countershaded, for, camouflage, that, is, they, have, black, backs, and, wings, with, white, fronts, a, predator, looking, up, from, below, such, as, an, orca, or, a, leopard, seal, has, difficulty, distinguishing, between, a, white, penguin, belly, and, the, reflective, water, surface, the, dark, plumage, on, their, backs, camouflages, them, from, above, gentoo, penguins, are, the, fastest, underwater, birds, in, the, world, they, are, capable, of, reaching, speeds, up, to, 36, km, about, 22, miles, per, hour, while, searching, for, food, or, escaping, from, predators, they, are, also, able, to, dive, to, depths, of, 170, 200, meters, about, 560, 660, feet, the, small, penguins, do, not, usually, dive, deep, they, catch, their, prey, near, the, surface, in, dives, that, normally, last, only, one, or, two, minutes, larger, penguins, can, dive, deep, in, case, of, need, emperor, penguins, are, the, world, s, deepest, diving, birds, they, can, dive, to, depths, of, approximately, 550, meters, 1, 800, feet, while, searching, for, food, penguins, either, waddle, on, their, feet, or, slide, on, their, bellies, across, the, snow, while, using, their, feet, to, propel, and, steer, themselves, a, movement, called, tobogganing, which, conserves, energy, while, moving, quickly, they, also, jump, with, both, feet, together, if, they, want, to, move, more, quickly, or, cross, steep, or, rocky, terrain, penguins, have, an, average, sense, of, hearing, for, birds, this, is, used, by, parents, and, chicks, to, locate, one, another, in, crowded, colonies, their, eyes, are, adapted, for, underwater, vision, and, are, their, primary, means, of, locating, prey, and, avoiding, predators, in, air, it, has, been, suggested, that, they, are, nearsighted, although, research, has, not, supported, this, hypothesis, penguins, have, a, thick, layer, of, insulating, feathers, that, keeps, them, warm, in, water, heat, loss, in, water, is, much, greater, than, in, air, the, emperor, penguin, has, a, maximum, feather, density, of, about, nine, feathers, per, square, centimeter, which, is, actually, much, lower, than, other, birds, that, live, in, antarctic, environments, however, they, have, been, identified, as, having, at, least, four, different, types, of, feather, in, addition, to, the, traditional, feather, the, emperor, has, afterfeathers, plumules, and, filoplumes, the, afterfeathers, are, downy, plumes, that, attach, directly, to, the, main, feathers, and, were, once, believed, to, account, for, the, bird, s, ability, to, conserve, heat, when, under, water, the, plumules, are, small, down, feathers, that, attach, directly, to, the, skin, and, are, much, more, dense, in, penguins, than, other, birds, lastly, the, filoplumes, are, small, less, than, 1, cm, long, naked, shafts, that, end, in, a, splay, of, fibers, filoplumes, were, believed, to, give, flying, birds, a, sense, of, where, their, plumage, was, and, whether, or, not, it, needed, preening, so, their, presence, in, penguins, may, seem, inconsistent, but, penguins, also, preen, extensively, the, emperor, penguin, has, the, largest, body, mass, of, all, penguins, which, further, reduces, relative, surface, area, and, heat, loss, they, also, are, able, to, control, blood, flow, to, their, extremities, reducing, the, amount, of, blood, that, gets, cold, but, still, keeping, the, extremities, from, freezing, in, the, extreme, cold, of, the, antarctic, winter, the, females, are, at, sea, fishing, for, food, leaving, the, males, to, brave, the, weather, by, themselves, they, often, huddle, together, to, keep, warm, and, rotate, positions, to, make, sure, that, each, penguin, gets, a, turn, in, the, centre, of, the, heat, pack, calculations, of, the, heat, loss, and, retention, ability, of, marine, endotherms, suggest, that, most, extant, penguins, are, too, small, to, survive, in, such, cold, environments, in, 2007, thomas, and, fordyce, wrote, about, the, heterothermic, loophole, that, penguins, utilize, in, order, to, survive, in, antarctica, all, extant, penguins, even, those, that, live, in, warmer, climates, have, a, counter, current, heat, exchanger, called, the, humeral, plexus, the, flippers, of, penguins, have, at, least, three, branches, of, the, axillary, artery, which, allows, cold, blood, to, be, heated, by, blood, that, has, already, been, warmed, and, limits, heat, loss, from, the, flippers, this, system, allows, penguins, to, efficiently, use, their, body, heat, and, explains, why, such, small, animals, can, survive, in, the, extreme, cold, they, can, drink, salt, water, because, their, supraorbital, gland, filters, excess, salt, from, the, bloodstream, the, salt, is, excreted, in, a, concentrated, fluid, from, the, nasal, passages, the, great, auk, of, the, northern, hemisphere, now, extinct, was, superficially, similar, to, penguins, and, the, word, penguin, was, originally, used, for, that, bird, centuries, ago, they, are, only, distantly, related, to, the, penguins, but, are, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, perhaps, one, in, 50, 000, penguins, of, most, species, are, born, with, brown, rather, than, black, plumage, these, are, called, isabelline, penguins, isabellinism, is, different, from, albinism, isabelline, penguins, tend, to, live, shorter, lives, than, normal, penguins, as, they, are, not, well, camouflaged, against, the, deep, and, are, often, passed, over, as, mates, although, almost, all, penguin, species, are, native, to, the, southern, hemisphere, they, are, not, found, only, in, cold, climates, such, as, antarctica, in, fact, only, a, few, species, of, penguin, actually, live, so, far, south, several, species, live, in, the, temperate, zone, one, the, gal, pagos, penguin, lives, as, far, north, as, the, gal, pagos, islands, but, this, is, only, made, possible, by, the, cold, rich, waters, of, the, antarctic, humboldt, current, that, flows, around, these, islands, also, though, the, climate, of, the, arctic, and, antarctic, regions, is, similar, there, are, no, penguins, found, in, the, arctic, several, authors, have, suggested, that, penguins, are, a, good, example, of, bergmann, s, rule, where, larger, bodied, populations, live, at, higher, latitudes, than, smaller, bodied, populations, there, is, some, disagreement, about, this, and, several, other, authors, have, noted, that, there, are, fossil, penguin, species, that, contradict, this, hypothesis, and, that, ocean, currents, and, upwellings, are, likely, to, have, had, a, greater, effect, on, species, diversity, than, latitude, alone, major, populations, of, penguins, are, found, in, angola, antarctica, argentina, australia, chile, namibia, new, zealand, and, south, africa, satellite, images, and, photos, released, in, 2018, show, the, population, of, 2, million, in, france, s, remote, ile, aux, cochons, has, collapsed, with, barely, 200, 000, remaining, according, to, a, study, published, in, antarctic, science, penguins, for, the, most, part, breed, in, large, colonies, the, exceptions, being, the, yellow, eyed, and, fiordland, species, these, colonies, may, range, in, size, from, as, few, as, 100, pairs, for, gentoo, penguins, to, several, hundred, thousand, in, the, case, of, king, macaroni, and, chinstrap, penguins, living, in, colonies, results, in, a, high, level, of, social, interaction, between, birds, which, has, led, to, a, large, repertoire, of, visual, as, well, as, vocal, displays, in, all, penguin, species, agonistic, displays, are, those, intended, to, confront, or, drive, off, or, alternately, appease, and, avoid, conflict, with, other, individuals, penguins, form, monogamous, pairs, for, a, breeding, season, though, the, rate, the, same, pair, recouples, varies, drastically, most, penguins, lay, two, eggs, in, a, clutch, although, the, two, largest, species, the, emperor, and, the, king, penguins, lay, only, one, with, the, exception, of, the, emperor, penguin, where, the, male, does, it, all, all, penguins, share, the, incubation, duties, these, incubation, shifts, can, last, days, and, even, weeks, as, one, member, of, the, pair, feeds, at, sea, penguins, generally, only, lay, one, brood, the, exception, is, the, little, penguin, which, can, raise, two, or, three, broods, in, a, season, penguin, eggs, are, smaller, than, any, other, bird, species, when, compared, proportionally, to, the, weight, of, the, parent, birds, at, 52, g, 2, oz, the, little, penguin, egg, is, 4, 7, of, its, mothers, weight, and, the, 450, g, 1, lb, emperor, penguin, egg, is, 2, 3, the, relatively, thick, shell, forms, between, 10, and, 16, of, the, weight, of, a, penguin, egg, presumably, to, reduce, the, effects, of, dehydration, and, to, minimize, the, risk, of, breakage, in, an, adverse, nesting, environment, the, yolk, too, is, large, and, comprises, 22, 31, of, the, egg, some, yolk, often, remains, when, a, chick, is, born, and, is, thought, to, help, sustain, the, chick, if, the, parents, are, delayed, in, returning, with, food, when, emperor, penguin, mothers, lose, a, chick, they, sometimes, attempt, to, steal, another, mother, s, chick, usually, unsuccessfully, as, other, females, in, the, vicinity, assist, the, defending, mother, in, keeping, her, chick, in, some, species, such, as, emperor, and, king, penguins, the, chicks, assemble, in, large, groups, called, cr, ches, the, majority, of, living, penguin, species, have, declining, populations, according, to, the, iucn, red, list, their, conservation, statuses, range, from, least, concern, through, to, endangered, penguins, have, no, special, fear, of, humans, and, will, often, approach, groups, of, people, this, is, probably, because, penguins, have, no, land, predators, in, antarctica, or, the, nearby, offshore, islands, they, are, preyed, upon, by, other, birds, like, skuas, especially, in, eggs, and, as, fledglings, other, birds, like, petrels, sheathbills, and, gulls, also, eat, the, chicks, dogs, preyed, upon, penguins, while, they, were, allowed, in, antarctica, during, the, age, of, early, human, exploration, as, sled, dogs, but, dogs, have, long, since, been, banned, from, antarctica, instead, adult, penguins, are, at, risk, at, sea, from, predators, such, as, sharks, orcas, and, leopard, seals, typically, penguins, do, not, approach, closer, than, around, 9, feet, 2,
