the, spleen, is, an, organ, found, in, almost, all, vertebrates, similar, in, structure, to, a, large, lymph, node, it, acts, primarily, as, a, blood, filter, the, word, spleen, comes, from, ancient, greek, spl, n, the, spleen, plays, very, important, roles, in, regard, to, red, blood, cells, erythrocytes, and, the, immune, system, it, removes, old, red, blood, cells, and, holds, a, reserve, of, blood, which, can, be, valuable, in, case, of, hemorrhagic, shock, and, also, recycles, iron, as, a, part, of, the, mononuclear, phagocyte, system, it, metabolizes, hemoglobin, removed, from, senescent, red, blood, cells, the, globin, portion, of, hemoglobin, is, degraded, to, its, constitutive, amino, acids, and, the, heme, portion, is, metabolized, to, bilirubin, which, is, removed, in, the, liver, the, spleen, houses, antibody, producing, lymphocytes, in, its, white, pulp, and, monocytes, which, remove, antibody, coated, bacteria, and, antibody, coated, blood, cells, by, way, of, blood, and, lymph, node, circulation, these, monocytes, upon, moving, to, injured, tissue, such, as, the, heart, after, myocardial, infarction, turn, into, dendritic, cells, and, macrophages, while, promoting, tissue, healing, the, spleen, is, a, center, of, activity, of, the, mononuclear, phagocyte, system, and, is, analogous, to, a, large, lymph, node, as, its, absence, causes, a, predisposition, to, certain, infections, in, humans, the, spleen, is, purple, in, color, and, is, in, the, left, upper, quadrant, of, the, abdomen, the, surgical, process, to, remove, the, spleen, is, known, as, a, splenectomy, the, spleen, is, underneath, the, left, part, of, the, diaphragm, and, has, a, smooth, convex, surface, that, faces, the, diaphragm, it, is, underneath, the, ninth, tenth, and, eleventh, ribs, the, other, side, of, the, spleen, is, divided, by, a, ridge, into, two, regions, an, anterior, gastric, portion, and, a, posterior, renal, portion, the, gastric, surface, is, directed, forward, upward, and, toward, the, middle, is, broad, and, concave, and, is, in, contact, with, the, posterior, wall, of, the, stomach, below, this, it, is, in, contact, with, the, tail, of, the, pancreas, the, renal, surface, is, directed, medialward, and, downward, it, is, somewhat, flattened, considerably, narrower, than, the, gastric, surface, and, is, in, relation, with, the, upper, part, of, the, anterior, surface, of, the, left, kidney, and, occasionally, with, the, left, adrenal, gland, there, are, four, ligaments, attached, to, the, spleen, gastrosplenic, ligament, splenorenal, ligament, colicosplenic, ligament, and, phrenocolic, ligament, the, spleen, in, healthy, adult, humans, is, approximately, 7, to, 14, centimetres, 3, to, 5, 1, 2, in, in, length, an, easy, way, to, remember, the, anatomy, of, the, spleen, is, the, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, rule, the, spleen, is, 1, by, 3, by, 5, inches, 3, by, 8, by, 13, cm, weighs, approximately, 7, oz, 200, g, and, lies, between, the, 9th, and, 11th, ribs, on, the, left, hand, side, and, along, the, axis, of, the, 10th, rib, the, weight, varies, between, 1, oz, 28, g, and, 8, oz, 230, g, standard, reference, range, correlating, mainly, to, height, body, weight, and, degree, of, acute, congestion, but, not, to, sex, or, age, near, the, middle, of, the, spleen, is, a, long, fissure, the, hilum, which, is, the, point, of, attachment, for, the, gastrosplenic, ligament, and, the, point, of, insertion, for, the, splenic, artery, and, splenic, vein, there, are, other, openings, present, for, lymphatic, vessels, and, nerves, in, addition, to, the, splenic, artery, collateral, blood, supply, is, provided, by, the, adjacent, short, gastric, arteries, like, the, thymus, the, spleen, possesses, only, efferent, lymphatic, vessels, the, spleen, is, part, of, the, lymphatic, system, both, the, short, gastric, arteries, and, the, splenic, artery, supply, it, with, blood, the, germinal, centers, are, supplied, by, arterioles, called, penicilliary, radicles, the, spleen, is, innervated, by, the, splenic, plexus, which, connects, a, branch, of, the, celiac, ganglia, to, the, vagus, nerve, the, underlying, central, nervous, processes, coordinating, the, spleen, s, function, seem, to, be, embedded, into, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, and, the, brainstem, especially, the, subfornical, organ, the, spleen, is, unique, in, respect, to, its, development, within, the, gut, while, most, of, the, gut, organs, are, endodermally, derived, the, spleen, is, derived, from, mesenchymal, tissue, specifically, the, spleen, forms, within, and, from, the, dorsal, mesentery, however, it, still, shares, the, same, blood, supply, the, celiac, trunk, as, the, foregut, organs, other, functions, of, the, spleen, are, less, prominent, especially, in, the, healthy, adult, enlargement, of, the, spleen, is, known, as, splenomegaly, it, may, be, caused, by, sickle, cell, anemia, sarcoidosis, malaria, bacterial, endocarditis, leukemia, polycythemia, vera, pernicious, anemia, gaucher, s, disease, leishmaniasis, hodgkin, s, disease, banti, s, disease, hereditary, spherocytosis, cysts, glandular, fever, including, mononucleosis, or, mono, caused, by, the, epstein, barr, virus, and, infection, from, cytomegalovirus, and, tumours, primary, tumors, of, the, spleen, include, hemangiomas, and, hemangiosarcomas, marked, splenomegaly, may, result, in, the, spleen, occupying, a, large, portion, of, the, left, side, of, the, abdomen, the, spleen, is, the, largest, collection, of, lymphoid, tissue, in, the, body, it, is, normally, palpable, in, preterm, infants, in, 30, of, normal, full, term, neonates, and, in, 5, to, 10, of, infants, and, toddlers, a, spleen, easily, palpable, below, the, costal, margin, in, any, child, over, the, age, of, 3, 4, years, should, be, considered, abnormal, until, proven, otherwise, splenomegaly, can, result, from, antigenic, stimulation, e, g, infection, obstruction, of, blood, flow, e, g, portal, vein, obstruction, underlying, functional, abnormality, e, g, hemolytic, anemia, or, infiltration, e, g, leukemia, or, storage, disease, such, as, gaucher, s, disease, the, most, common, cause, of, acute, splenomegaly, in, children, is, viral, infection, which, is, transient, and, usually, moderate, basic, work, up, for, acute, splenomegaly, includes, a, complete, blood, count, with, differential, platelet, count, and, reticulocyte, and, atypical, lymphocyte, counts, to, exclude, hemolytic, anemia, and, leukemia, assessment, of, igm, antibodies, to, viral, capsid, antigen, a, rising, titer, is, indicated, to, confirm, epstein, barr, virus, or, cytomegalovirus, other, infections, should, be, excluded, if, these, tests, are, negative, calculators, have, been, developed, for, measurements, of, spleen, size, based, on, ct, us, and, mri, findings, trauma, such, as, a, road, traffic, collision, can, cause, rupture, of, the, spleen, which, is, a, situation, requiring, immediate, medical, attention, asplenia, refers, to, a, non, functioning, spleen, which, may, be, congenital, or, caused, by, traumatic, injury, surgical, resection, splenectomy, or, a, disease, such, as, sickle, cell, anaemia, hyposplenia, refers, to, a, partially, functioning, spleen, these, conditions, may, cause, a, modest, increase, in, circulating, white, blood, cells, and, platelets, a, diminished, response, to, some, vaccines, and, an, increased, susceptibility, to, infection, in, particular, there, is, an, increased, risk, of, sepsis, from, polysaccharide, encapsulated, bacteria, encapsulated, bacteria, inhibit, binding, of, complement, or, prevent, complement, assembled, on, the, capsule, from, interacting, with, macrophage, receptors, phagocytosis, needs, natural, antibodies, which, are, immunoglobulins, that, facilitate, phagocytosis, either, directly, or, by, complement, deposition, on, the, capsule, they, are, produced, by, igm, memory, b, cells, a, subtype, of, b, cells, in, the, marginal, zone, of, the, spleen, a, splenectomy, removal, of, the, spleen, results, in, a, greatly, diminished, frequency, of, memory, b, cells, a, 28, year, follow, up, of, 740, world, war, ii, veterans, whose, spleens, were, removed, on, the, battlefield, showed, a, significant, increase, in, the, usual, death, rate, from, pneumonia, 6, rather, than, the, expected, 1, 3, and, an, increase, in, the, death, rate, from, ischemic, heart, disease, 41, rather, than, the, expected, 30, but, not, from, other, conditions, an, accessory, spleen, is, a, small, splenic, nodule, extra, to, the, spleen, usually, formed, in, early, embryogenesis, accessory, spleens, are, found, in, approximately, 10, percent, of, the, population, and, are, typically, around, 1, centimeter, in, diameter, splenosis, is, a, condition, where, displaced, pieces, of, splenic, tissue, often, following, trauma, or, splenectomy, autotransplant, in, the, abdominal, cavity, as, accessory, spleens, polysplenia, is, a, congenital, disease, manifested, by, multiple, small, accessory, spleens, rather, than, a, single, full, sized, normal, spleen, polysplenia, sometimes, occurs, alone, but, it, is, often, accompanied, by, other, developmental, abnormalities, such, as, intestinal, malrotation, or, biliary, atresia, or, cardiac, abnormalities, such, as, dextrocardia, these, accessory, spleens, are, non, functional, splenic, infarction, is, a, condition, in, which, blood, flow, supply, to, the, spleen, is, compromised, leading, to, partial, or, complete, infarction, tissue, death, due, to, oxygen, shortage, in, the, organ, splenic, infarction, occurs, when, the, splenic, artery, or, one, of, its, branches, are, occluded, for, example, by, a, blood, clot, although, it, can, occur, asymptomatically, the, typical, symptom, is, severe, pain, in, the, left, upper, quadrant, of, the, abdomen, sometimes, radiating, to, the, left, shoulder, fever, and, chills, develop, in, some, cases, it, has, to, be, differentiated, from, other, causes, of, acute, abdomen, the, spleen, may, be, affected, by, hyaloserositis, in, which, it, is, coated, with, fibrous, hyaline, there, has, been, a, long, and, varied, history, of, misconceptions, regarding, the, physiological, role, of, the, spleen, and, it, has, often, been, seen, as, a, reservoir, for, juices, closely, linked, to, digestion, in, various, cultures, the, organ, has, been, linked, to, melancholia, due, to, the, influence, of, ancient, greek, medicine, and, the, associated, doctrine, of, humourism, in, which, the, spleen, was, believed, to, be, a, reservoir, for, an, elusive, fluid, known, as, black, bile, one, of, the, four, humours, the, spleen, also, plays, an, important, role, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, where, it, is, considered, to, be, a, key, organ, that, displays, the, yin, aspect, of, the, earth, element, its, yang, counterpart, is, the, stomach, in, contrast, the, talmud, tractate, berachoth, 61b, refers, to, the, spleen, as, the, organ, of, laughter, while, possibly, suggesting, a, link, with, the, humoral, view, of, the, organ, etymologically, spleen, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, spl, n, where, it, was, the, idiomatic, equivalent, of, the, heart, in, modern, english, persius, in, his, satires, associated, spleen, with, immoderate, laughter, in, english, william, shakespeare, frequently, used, the, word, spleen, to, signify, melancholy, but, also, caprice, and, merriment, in, julius, caesar, he, uses, the, spleen, to, describe, cassius, s, irritable, nature, must, i, observe, you, must, i, stand, and, crouch, under, your, testy, humour, by, the, gods, you, shall, digest, the, venom, of, your, spleen, though, it, do, split, you, for, from, this, day, forth, i, ll, use, you, for, my, mirth, yea, for, my, laughter, when, you, are, waspish, the, spleen, as, a, byword, for, melancholy, has, also, been, considered, an, actual, disease, in, the, early, 18th, century, the, physician, richard, blackmore, considered, it, to, be, one, of, the, two, most, prevalent, diseases, in, england, along, with, consumption, in, 1701, anne, finch, later, countess, of, winchilsea, had, published, a, pindaric, ode, the, spleen, drawing, on, her, first, hand, experiences, of, an, affliction, which, at, the, time, also, had, a, reputation, of, being, a, fashionably, upper, class, disease, of, the, english, both, blackmore, and, george, cheyne, treated, this, malady, as, the, male, equivalent, of, the, vapours, while, preferring, the, more, learned, terms, hypochondriasis, and, hysteria, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, german, word, spleen, came, to, denote, eccentric, and, hypochondriac, tendencies, that, were, thought, to, be, characteristic, of, english, people, in, french, spl, n, tique, refers, to, a, state, of, pensive, sadness, or, melancholy, this, usage, was, popularised, by, the, poems, of, charles, baudelaire, 1821, 1867, and, his, collection, le, spleen, de, paris, but, it, was, also, present, in, earlier, 19th, century, romantic, literature, the, spleen, is, one, of, the, many, organs, that, may, be, included, in, offal, it, is, not, widely, eaten, as, a, principal, ingredient, but, cow, spleen, sandwiches, are, eaten, in, sicilian, cuisine, chicken, spleen, is, one, of, the, main, ingredients, of, jerusalem, mixed, grill, in, cartilaginous, and, ray, finned, fish, the, spleen, consists, primarily, of, red, pulp, and, is, normally, somewhat, elongated, as, it, lies, inside, the, serosal, lining, of, the, intestine, in, many, amphibians, especially, frogs, it, has, the, more, rounded, form, and, there, is, often, a, greater, quantity, of, white, pulp, in, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, white, pulp, is, always, relatively, plentiful, and, in, birds, and, some, mammals, the, spleen, is, typically, rounded, but, it, adjusts, its, shape, somewhat, to, the, arrangement, of, the, surrounding, organs, in, most, vertebrates, the, spleen, continues, to, produce, red, blood, cells, throughout, life, only, in, mammals, this, function, is, lost, in, middle, aged, adults, many, mammals, have, tiny, spleen, like, structures, known, as, haemal, nodes, throughout, the, body, that, are, presumed, to, have, the, same, function, as, the, spleen, the, spleens, of, aquatic, mammals, differ, in, some, ways, from, those, of, fully, land, dwelling, mammals, in, general, they, are, bluish, in, colour, in, cetaceans, and, manatees, they, tend, to, be, quite, small, but, in, deep, diving, pinnipeds, they, can, be, massive, due, to, their, function, of, storing, red, blood, cells, marsupials, have, y, shaped, spleens, and, it, develops, postnatally, the, only, vertebrates, lacking, a, spleen, are, the, lampreys, and, hagfishes, the, early, branching, cyclostomata, or, jawless, fishes, even, in, these, animals, there, is, a, diffuse, layer, of, haematopoeitic, tissue, within, the, gut, wall, which, has, a, similar, structure, to, red, pulp, and, is, presumed, homologous, with, the, spleen, of, higher, vertebrates, in, mice, the, spleen, stores, half, the, body, s, monocytes, so, that, upon, injury, they, can, migrate, to, the, injured, tissue, and, transform, into, dendritic, cells, and, macrophages, to, assist, wound, healing
