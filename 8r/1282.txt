human, teeth, function, to, mechanically, break, down, items, of, food, by, cutting, and, crushing, them, in, preparation, for, swallowing, and, digesting, as, such, they, are, considered, part, of, the, human, digestive, system, humans, have, four, types, of, teeth, incisors, canines, premolars, and, molars, which, each, have, a, specific, function, the, incisors, cut, the, food, the, canines, tear, the, food, and, the, molars, and, premolars, crush, the, food, the, roots, of, teeth, are, embedded, in, the, maxilla, upper, jaw, or, the, mandible, lower, jaw, and, are, covered, by, gums, teeth, are, made, of, multiple, tissues, of, varying, density, and, hardness, humans, like, most, other, mammals, are, diphyodont, meaning, that, they, develop, two, sets, of, teeth, the, first, set, deciduous, teeth, also, called, primary, teeth, baby, teeth, or, milk, teeth, normally, eventually, contains, 20, teeth, primary, teeth, typically, start, to, appear, erupt, around, six, months, of, age, and, this, may, be, distracting, and, or, painful, for, the, infant, however, some, babies, are, born, with, one, or, more, visible, teeth, known, as, neonatal, teeth, or, natal, teeth, dental, anatomy, is, a, field, of, anatomy, dedicated, to, the, study, of, tooth, structure, the, development, appearance, and, classification, of, teeth, fall, within, its, field, of, study, though, dental, occlusion, or, contact, between, teeth, does, not, dental, anatomy, is, also, a, taxonomic, science, as, it, is, concerned, with, the, naming, of, teeth, and, their, structures, this, information, serves, a, practical, purpose, for, dentists, enabling, them, to, easily, identify, and, describe, teeth, and, structures, during, treatment, the, anatomic, crown, of, a, tooth, is, the, area, covered, in, enamel, above, the, cementoenamel, junction, cej, or, neck, of, the, tooth, most, of, the, crown, is, composed, of, dentin, dentine, in, british, english, with, the, pulp, chamber, inside, the, crown, is, within, bone, before, eruption, after, eruption, it, is, almost, always, visible, the, anatomic, root, is, found, below, the, cej, and, is, covered, with, cementum, as, with, the, crown, dentin, composes, most, of, the, root, which, normally, has, pulp, canals, canines, and, most, premolars, except, for, maxillary, first, premolars, usually, have, one, root, maxillary, first, premolars, and, mandibular, molars, usually, have, two, roots, maxillary, molars, usually, have, three, roots, additional, roots, are, referred, to, as, supernumerary, roots, humans, usually, have, 20, primary, deciduous, baby, or, milk, teeth, and, 32, permanent, adult, teeth, teeth, are, classified, as, incisors, canines, premolars, also, called, bicuspids, and, molars, incisors, are, primarily, used, for, cutting, canines, are, for, tearing, and, molars, serve, for, grinding, most, teeth, have, identifiable, features, that, distinguish, them, from, others, there, are, several, different, notation, systems, to, refer, to, a, specific, tooth, the, three, most, common, systems, are, the, fdi, world, dental, federation, notation, iso, 3950, the, universal, numbering, system, and, the, palmer, notation, the, fdi, system, is, used, worldwide, the, universal, only, in, the, united, states, while, the, older, palmer, notation, still, has, some, adherents, only, in, the, united, kingdom, among, deciduous, primary, teeth, ten, are, found, in, the, maxilla, upper, jaw, and, ten, in, the, mandible, lower, jaw, for, a, total, of, 20, the, dental, formula, for, primary, teeth, in, humans, is, 2, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 2, in, the, primary, set, of, teeth, in, addition, to, the, canines, there, are, two, types, of, incisors, centrals, and, laterals, and, two, types, of, molars, first, and, second, all, primary, teeth, are, normally, later, replaced, with, their, permanent, counterparts, among, permanent, teeth, 16, are, found, in, the, maxilla, and, 16, in, the, mandible, for, a, total, of, 32, the, dental, formula, is, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, permanent, human, teeth, are, numbered, in, a, boustrophedonic, sequence, the, maxillary, teeth, are, the, maxillary, central, incisors, teeth, 8, and, 9, in, the, diagram, maxillary, lateral, incisors, 7, and, 10, maxillary, canines, 6, and, 11, maxillary, first, premolars, 5, and, 12, maxillary, second, premolars, 4, and, 13, maxillary, first, molars, 3, and, 14, maxillary, second, molars, 2, and, 15, and, maxillary, third, molars, 1, and, 16, the, mandibular, teeth, are, the, mandibular, central, incisors, 24, and, 25, mandibular, lateral, incisors, 23, and, 26, mandibular, canines, 22, and, 27, mandibular, first, premolars, 21, and, 28, mandibular, second, premolars, 20, and, 29, mandibular, first, molars, 19, and, 30, mandibular, second, molars, 18, and, 31, and, mandibular, third, molars, 17, and, 32, third, molars, are, commonly, called, wisdom, teeth, and, usually, emerge, at, ages, 17, to, 25, these, molars, may, never, erupt, into, the, mouth, or, form, at, all, when, they, do, form, they, often, must, be, removed, if, any, additional, teeth, form, for, example, fourth, and, fifth, molars, which, are, rare, they, are, referred, to, as, supernumerary, teeth, hyperdontia, development, of, fewer, than, the, usual, number, of, teeth, is, called, hypodontia, there, are, small, differences, between, the, teeth, of, males, and, females, with, male, teeth, along, with, the, male, jaw, tending, to, be, larger, on, average, than, female, teeth, and, jaw, there, are, also, differences, in, the, internal, dental, tissue, proportions, with, male, teeth, consisting, of, proportionately, more, dentine, while, female, teeth, have, proportionately, more, enamel, enamel, is, the, hardest, and, most, highly, mineralized, substance, of, the, body, it, has, its, origin, from, oral, ectoderm, it, is, one, of, the, four, major, tissues, which, make, up, the, tooth, along, with, dentin, cementum, and, dental, pulp, it, is, normally, visible, and, must, be, supported, by, underlying, dentin, 96, of, enamel, consists, of, mineral, with, water, and, organic, material, comprising, the, rest, the, normal, color, of, enamel, varies, from, light, yellow, to, grayish, white, at, the, edges, of, teeth, where, there, is, no, dentin, underlying, the, enamel, the, color, sometimes, has, a, slightly, blue, tone, since, enamel, is, semitranslucent, the, color, of, dentin, and, any, restorative, dental, material, underneath, the, enamel, strongly, affects, the, appearance, of, a, tooth, enamel, varies, in, thickness, over, the, surface, of, the, tooth, and, is, often, thickest, at, the, cusp, up, to, 2, 5mm, and, thinnest, at, its, border, which, is, seen, clinically, as, the, cej, the, wear, rate, of, enamel, called, attrition, is, 8, micrometers, a, year, from, normal, factors, enamel, s, primary, mineral, is, hydroxyapatite, which, is, a, crystalline, calcium, phosphate, the, large, amount, of, minerals, in, enamel, accounts, not, only, for, its, strength, but, also, for, its, brittleness, dentin, which, is, less, mineralized, and, less, brittle, compensates, for, enamel, and, is, necessary, as, a, support, unlike, dentin, and, bone, enamel, does, not, contain, collagen, proteins, of, note, in, the, development, of, enamel, are, ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins, and, tuftelins, it, is, believed, that, they, aid, in, the, development, of, enamel, by, serving, as, framework, support, among, other, functions, in, rare, circumstances, enamel, can, fail, to, form, leaving, the, underlying, dentine, exposed, on, the, surface, dentin, is, the, substance, between, enamel, or, cementum, and, the, pulp, chamber, it, is, secreted, by, the, odontoblasts, of, the, dental, pulp, the, formation, of, dentin, is, known, as, dentinogenesis, the, porous, yellow, hued, material, is, made, up, of, 70, inorganic, materials, 20, organic, materials, and, 10, water, by, weight, because, it, is, softer, than, enamel, it, decays, more, rapidly, and, is, subject, to, severe, cavities, if, not, properly, treated, but, dentin, still, acts, as, a, protective, layer, and, supports, the, crown, of, the, tooth, dentin, is, a, mineralized, connective, tissue, with, an, organic, matrix, of, collagenous, proteins, dentin, has, microscopic, channels, called, dentinal, tubules, which, radiate, outward, through, the, dentin, from, the, pulp, cavity, to, the, exterior, cementum, or, enamel, border, the, diameter, of, these, tubules, range, from, 2, 5, m, near, the, pulp, to, 1, 2, m, in, the, midportion, and, 900, nm, near, the, dentino, enamel, junction, although, they, may, have, tiny, side, branches, the, tubules, do, not, intersect, with, each, other, their, length, is, dictated, by, the, radius, of, the, tooth, the, three, dimensional, configuration, of, the, dentinal, tubules, is, genetically, determined, there, are, three, types, of, dentin, primary, secondary, and, tertiary, secondary, dentin, is, a, layer, of, dentin, produced, after, root, formation, and, continues, to, form, with, age, tertiary, dentin, is, created, in, response, to, stimulus, such, as, cavities, and, tooth, wear, cementum, is, a, specialized, bone, like, substance, covering, the, root, of, a, tooth, it, is, approximately, 45, inorganic, material, mainly, hydroxyapatite, 33, organic, material, mainly, collagen, and, 22, water, cementum, is, excreted, by, cementoblasts, within, the, root, of, the, tooth, and, is, thickest, at, the, root, apex, its, coloration, is, yellowish, and, it, is, softer, than, dentin, and, enamel, the, principal, role, of, cementum, is, to, serve, as, a, medium, by, which, the, periodontal, ligaments, can, attach, to, the, tooth, for, stability, at, the, cement, to, enamel, junction, the, cementum, is, acellular, due, to, its, lack, of, cellular, components, and, this, acellular, type, covers, at, least, of, the, root, the, more, permeable, form, of, cementum, cellular, cementum, covers, about, of, the, root, apex, the, dental, pulp, is, the, central, part, of, the, tooth, filled, with, soft, connective, tissue, this, tissue, contains, blood, vessels, and, nerves, that, enter, the, tooth, from, a, hole, at, the, apex, of, the, root, along, the, border, between, the, dentin, and, the, pulp, are, odontoblasts, which, initiate, the, formation, of, dentin, other, cells, in, the, pulp, include, fibroblasts, preodontoblasts, macrophages, and, t, lymphocytes, the, pulp, is, commonly, called, the, nerve, of, the, tooth, tooth, development, is, the, complex, process, by, which, teeth, form, from, embryonic, cells, grow, and, erupt, into, the, mouth, although, many, diverse, species, have, teeth, their, development, is, largely, the, same, as, in, humans, for, human, teeth, to, have, a, healthy, oral, environment, enamel, dentin, cementum, and, the, periodontium, must, all, develop, during, appropriate, stages, of, fetal, development, primary, teeth, start, to, form, in, the, development, of, the, embryo, between, the, sixth, and, eighth, weeks, and, permanent, teeth, begin, to, form, in, the, twentieth, week, if, teeth, do, not, start, to, develop, at, or, near, these, times, they, will, not, develop, at, all, a, significant, amount, of, research, has, focused, on, determining, the, processes, that, initiate, tooth, development, it, is, widely, accepted, that, there, is, a, factor, within, the, tissues, of, the, first, pharyngeal, arch, that, is, necessary, for, the, development, of, teeth, tooth, development, is, commonly, divided, into, the, following, stages, the, bud, stage, the, cap, the, bell, and, finally, maturation, the, staging, of, tooth, development, is, an, attempt, to, categorize, changes, that, take, place, along, a, continuum, frequently, it, is, difficult, to, decide, what, stage, should, be, assigned, to, a, particular, developing, tooth, this, determination, is, further, complicated, by, the, varying, appearance, of, different, histologic, sections, of, the, same, developing, tooth, which, can, appear, to, be, different, stages, the, tooth, bud, sometimes, called, the, tooth, germ, is, an, aggregation, of, cells, that, eventually, forms, a, tooth, it, is, organized, into, three, parts, the, enamel, organ, the, dental, papilla, and, the, dental, follicle, the, enamel, organ, is, composed, of, the, outer, enamel, epithelium, inner, enamel, epithelium, stellate, reticulum, and, stratum, intermedium, these, cells, give, rise, to, ameloblasts, which, produce, enamel, and, the, reduced, enamel, epithelium, the, growth, of, cervical, loop, cells, into, the, deeper, tissues, forms, hertwig, s, epithelial, root, sheath, which, determines, a, tooth, s, root, shape, the, dental, papilla, contains, cells, that, develop, into, odontoblasts, which, are, dentin, forming, cells, additionally, the, junction, between, the, dental, papilla, and, inner, enamel, epithelium, determines, the, crown, shape, of, a, tooth, the, dental, follicle, gives, rise, to, three, important, cells, cementoblasts, osteoblasts, and, fibroblasts, cementoblasts, form, the, cementum, of, a, tooth, osteoblasts, give, rise, to, the, alveolar, bone, around, the, roots, of, teeth, fibroblasts, develop, the, periodontal, ligaments, which, connect, teeth, to, the, alveolar, bone, through, cementum, tooth, eruption, in, humans, is, a, process, in, tooth, development, in, which, the, teeth, enter, the, mouth, and, become, visible, current, research, indicates, that, the, periodontal, ligaments, play, an, important, role, in, tooth, eruption, primary, teeth, erupt, into, the, mouth, from, around, six, months, until, two, years, of, age, these, teeth, are, the, only, ones, in, the, mouth, until, a, person, is, about, six, years, old, at, that, time, the, first, permanent, tooth, erupts, this, stage, during, which, a, person, has, a, combination, of, primary, and, permanent, teeth, is, known, as, the, mixed, stage, the, mixed, stage, lasts, until, the, last, primary, tooth, is, lost, and, the, remaining, permanent, teeth, erupt, into, the, mouth, there, have, been, many, theories, about, the, cause, of, tooth, eruption, one, theory, proposes, that, the, developing, root, of, a, tooth, pushes, it, into, the, mouth, another, known, as, the, cushioned, hammock, theory, resulted, from, microscopic, study, of, teeth, which, was, thought, to, show, a, ligament, around, the, root, it, was, later, discovered, that, the, ligament, was, merely, an, artifact, created, in, the, process, of, preparing, the, slide, currently, the, most, widely, held, belief, is, that, the, periodontal, ligaments, provide, the, main, impetus, for, the, process, the, onset, of, primary, tooth, loss, has, been, found, to, correlate, strongly, with, somatic, and, psychological, criteria, of, school, readiness, the, periodontium, is, the, supporting, structure, of, a, tooth, helping, to, attach, the, tooth, to, surrounding, tissues, and, to, allow, sensations, of, touch, and, pressure, it, consists, of, the, cementum, periodontal, ligaments, alveolar, bone, and, gingiva, of, these, cementum, is, the, only, one, that, is, a, part, of, a, tooth, periodontal, ligaments, connect, the, alveolar, bone, to, the, cementum, alveolar, bone, surrounds, the, roots, of, teeth, to, provide, support, and, creates, what, is, commonly, called, an, alveolus, or, socket, lying, over, the, bone, is, the, gingiva, or, gum, which, is, readily, visible, in, the, mouth, the, periodontal, ligament, is, a, specialized, connective, tissue, that, attaches, the, cementum, of, a, tooth, to, the, alveolar, bone, this, tissue, covers, the, root, of, the, tooth, within, the, bone, each, ligament, has, a, width, of, 0, 15, 0, 38mm, but, this, size, decreases, over, time, the, functions, of, the, periodontal, ligaments, include, attachment, of, the, tooth, to, the, bone, support, for, the, tooth, formation, and, resorption, of, bone, during, tooth, movement, sensation, and, eruption, the, cells, of, the, periodontal, ligaments, include, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and, epithelial, cell, rests, of, malassez, consisting, of, mostly, type, i, and, iii, collagen, the, fibers, are, grouped, in, bundles, and, named, according, to, their, location, the, groups, of, fibers, are, named, alveolar, crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and, interradicular, fibers, the, nerve, supply, generally, enters, from, the, bone, apical, to, the, tooth, and, forms, a, network, around, the, tooth, toward, the, crest, of, the, gingiva, when, pressure, is, exerted, on, a, tooth, such, as, during, chewing, or, biting, the, tooth, moves, slightly, in, its, socket, and, puts, tension, on, the, periodontal, ligaments, the, nerve, fibers, can, then, send, the, information, to, the, central, nervous, system, for, interpretation, the, alveolar, bone, is, the, bone, of, the, jaw, which, forms, the, alveolus, around, teeth, like, any, other, bone, in, the, human, body, alveolar, bone, is, modified, throughout, life, osteoblasts, create, bone, and, osteoclasts, destroy, it, especially, if, force, is, placed, on, a, tooth, as, is, the, case, when, movement, of, teeth, is, attempted, through, orthodontics, an, area, of, bone, under, compressive, force, from, a, tooth, moving, toward, it, has, a, high, osteoclast, level, resulting, in, bone, resorption, an, area, of, bone, receiving, tension, from, periodontal, ligaments, attached, to, a, tooth, moving, away, from, it, has, a, high, number, of, osteoblasts, resulting, in, bone, formation, the, gingiva, gums, is, the, mucosal, tissue, that, overlays, the, jaws, there, are, three, different, types, of, epithelium, associated, with, the, gingiva, gingival, junctional, and, sulcular, epithelium, these, three, types, form, from, a, mass, of, epithelial, cells, known, as, the, epithelial, cuff, between, the, tooth, and, the, mouth, the, gingival, epithelium, is, not, associated, directly, with, tooth, attachment, and, is, visible, in, the, mouth, the, junctional, epithelium, composed, of, the, basal, lamina, and, hemidesmosomes, forms, an, attachment, to, the, tooth, the, sulcular, epithelium, is, nonkeratinized, stratified, squamous, tissue, on, the, gingiva, which, touches, but, is, not, attached, to, the, tooth, plaque, is, a, biofilm, consisting, of, large, quantities, of, various, bacteria, that, form, on, teeth, if, not, removed, regularly, plaque, buildup, can, lead, to, periodontal, problems, such, as, gingivitis, given, time, plaque, can, mineralize, along, the, gingiva, forming, tartar, the, microorganisms, that, form, the, biofilm, are, almost, entirely, bacteria, mainly, streptococcus, and, anaerobes, with, the, composition, varying, by, location, in, the, mouth, streptococcus, mutans, is, the, most, important, bacterium, associated, with, dental, caries, certain, bacteria, in, the, mouth, live, off, the, remains, of, foods, especially, sugars, and, starches, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, they, produce, lactic, acid, which, dissolves, the, calcium, and, phosphorus, in, the, enamel, this, process, known, as, demineralisation, leads, to, tooth, destruction, saliva, gradually, neutralises, the, acids, which, causes, the, ph, of, the, tooth, surface, to, rise, above, the, critical, ph, typically, considered, to, be, 5, 5, this, causes, remineralisation, the, return, of, the, dissolved, minerals, to, the, enamel, if, there, is, sufficient, time, between, the, intake, of, foods, then, the, impact, is, limited, and, the, teeth, can, repair, themselves, saliva, is, unable, to, penetrate, through, plaque, however, to, neutralize, the, acid, produced, by, the, bacteria, dental, caries, cavities, described, as, tooth, decay, is, an, infectious, disease, which, damages, the, structures, of, teeth, the, disease, can, lead, to, pain, tooth, loss, and, infection, dental, caries, has, a, long, history, with, evidence, showing, the, disease, was, present, in, the, bronze, iron, and, middle, ages, but, also, prior, to, the, neolithic, period, the, largest, increases, in, the, prevalence, of, caries, have, been, associated, with, diet, changes, today, caries, remains, one, of, the, most, common, diseases, throughout, the, world, in, the, united, states, dental, caries, is, the, most, common, chronic, childhood, disease, being, at, least, five, times, more, common, than, asthma, countries, that, have, experienced, an, overall, decrease, in, cases, of, tooth, decay, continue, to, have, a, disparity, in, the, distribution, of, the, disease, among, children, in, the, united, states, and, europe, 60, 80, of, cases, of, dental, caries, occur, in, 20, of, the, population, tooth, decay, is, caused, by, certain, types, of, acid, producing, bacteria, which, cause, the, most, damage, in, the, presence, of, fermentable, carbohydrates, such, as, sucrose, fructose, and, glucose, the, resulting, acidic, levels, in, the, mouth, affect, teeth, because, a, tooth, s, special, mineral, content, causes, it, to, be, sensitive, to, low, ph, depending, on, the, extent, of, tooth, destruction, various, treatments, can, be, used, to, restore, teeth, to, proper, form, function, and, aesthetics, but, there, is, no, known, method, to, regenerate, large, amounts, of, tooth, structure, instead, dental, health, organizations, advocate, preventive, and, prophylactic, measures, such, as, regular, oral, hygiene, and, dietary, modifications, to, avoid, dental, caries, oral, hygiene, is, the, practice, of, keeping, the, mouth, clean, and, is, a, means, of, preventing, dental, caries, gingivitis, periodontal, disease, bad, breath, and, other, dental, disorders, it, consists, of, both, professional, and, personal, care, regular, cleanings, usually, done, by, dentists, and, dental, hygienists, remove, tartar, mineralized, plaque, that, may, develop, even, with, careful, brushing, and, flossing, professional, cleaning, includes, tooth, scaling, using, various, instruments, or, devices, to, loosen, and, remove, deposits, from, teeth, the, purpose, of, cleaning, teeth, is, to, remove, plaque, which, consists, mostly, of, bacteria, healthcare, professionals, recommend, regular, brushing, twice, a, day, in, the, morning, and, in, the, evening, or, after, meals, in, order, to, prevent, formation, of, plaque, and, tartar, a, toothbrush, is, able, to, remove, most, plaque, except, in, areas, between, teeth, as, a, result, flossing, is, also, considered, a, necessity, to, maintain, oral, hygiene, when, used, correctly, dental, floss, removes, plaque, from, between, teeth, and, at, the, gum, line, where, periodontal, disease, often, begins, and, could, develop, caries, electric, toothbrushes, are, a, popular, aid, to, oral, hygiene, a, user, without, disabilities, with, proper, training, in, manual, brushing, and, with, good, motivation, can, achieve, standards, of, oral, hygiene, at, least, as, satisfactory, as, the, best, electric, brushes, but, untrained, users, rarely, achieve, anything, of, the, kind, not, all, electric, toothbrushes, are, equally, effective, and, even, a, good, design, needs, to, be, used, properly, for, best, effect, but, electric, toothbrushes, tend, to, help, people, who, are, not, as, good, at, cleaning, teeth, and, as, a, result, have, had, oral, hygiene, problems, the, most, important, advantage, of, electric, toothbrushes, is, their, ability, to, aid, people, with, dexterity, difficulties, such, as, those, associated, with, rheumatoid, arthritis, fluoride, therapy, is, often, recommended, to, protect, against, dental, caries, water, fluoridation, and, fluoride, supplements, decrease, the, incidence, of, dental, caries, fluoride, helps, prevent, dental, decay, by, binding, to, the, hydroxyapatite, crystals, in, enamel, the, incorporated, fluoride, makes, enamel, more, resistant, to, demineralization, and, thus, more, resistant, to, decay, topical, fluoride, such, as, a, fluoride, toothpaste, or, mouthwash, is, also, recommended, to, protect, teeth, surfaces, many, dentists, include, application, of, topical, fluoride, solutions, as, part, of, routine, cleanings, dental, sealants, are, another, preventive, therapy, often, used, to, provide, a, barrier, to, bacteria, and, decay, on, the, surface, of, teeth, sealants, can, last, up, to, ten, years, and, are, primarily, used, on, the, biting, surfaces, of, molars, of, children, and, young, adults, especially, those, who, may, have, difficulty, brushing, and, flossing, effectively, sealants, are, applied, in, a, dentist, s, office, sometimes, by, a, dental, hygienist, in, a, procedure, similar, in, technique, and, cost, to, a, fluoride, application, after, a, tooth, has, been, damaged, or, destroyed, restoration, of, the, missing, structure, can, be, achieved, with, a, variety, of, treatments, restorations, may, be, created, from, a, variety, of, materials, including, glass, ionomer, amalgam, gold, porcelain, and, composite, small, restorations, placed, inside, a, tooth, are, referred, to, as, intracoronal, restorations, these, restorations, may, be, formed, directly, in, the, mouth, or, may, be, cast, using, the, lost, wax, technique, such, as, for, some, inlays, and, onlays, when, larger, portions, of, a, tooth, are, lost, an, extracoronal, restoration, may, be, fabricated, such, as, an, artificial, crown, or, a, veneer, to, restore, the, involved, tooth, when, a, tooth, is, lost, dentures, bridges, or, implants, may, be, used, as, replacements, dentures, are, usually, the, least, costly, whereas, implants, are, usually, the, most, expensive, dentures, may, replace, complete, arches, of, the, mouth, or, only, a, partial, number, of, teeth, bridges, replace, smaller, spaces, of, missing, teeth, and, use, adjacent, teeth, to, support, the, restoration, dental, implants, may, be, used, to, replace, a, single, tooth, or, a, series, of, teeth, though, implants, are, the, most, expensive, treatment, option, they, are, often, the, most, desirable, restoration, because, of, their, aesthetics, and, function, to, improve, the, function, of, dentures, implants, may, be, used, as, support, tooth, abnormalities, may, be, categorized, according, to, whether, they, have, environmental, or, developmental, causes, while, environmental, abnormalities, may, appear, to, have, an, obvious, cause, there, may, not, appear, to, be, any, known, cause, for, some, developmental, abnormalities, environmental, forces, may, affect, teeth, during, development, destroy, tooth, structure, after, development, discolor, teeth, at, any, stage, of, development, or, alter, the, course, of, tooth, eruption, developmental, abnormalities, most, commonly, affect, the, number, size, shape, and, structure, of, teeth, tooth, abnormalities, caused, by, environmental, factors, during, tooth, development, have, long, lasting, effects, enamel, and, dentin, do, not, regenerate, after, they, mineralize, initially, enamel, hypoplasia, is, a, condition, in, which, the, amount, of, enamel, formed, is, inadequate, this, results, either, in, pits, and, grooves, in, areas, of, the, tooth, or, in, widespread, absence, of, enamel, diffuse, opacities, of, enamel, does, not, affect, the, amount, of, enamel, but, changes, its, appearance, affected, enamel, has, a, different, translucency, than, the, rest, of, the, tooth, demarcated, opacities, of, enamel, have, sharp, boundaries, where, the, translucency, decreases, and, manifest, a, white, cream, yellow, or, brown, color, all, these, may, be, caused, by, nutritional, factors, an, exanthematous, disease, chicken, pox, congenital, syphilis, undiagnosed, and, untreated, celiac, disease, hypocalcemia, dental, fluorosis, birth, injury, preterm, birth, infection, or, trauma, from, a, deciduous, tooth, dental, fluorosis, is, a, condition, which, results, from, ingesting, excessive, amounts, of, fluoride, and, leads, to, teeth, which, are, spotted, yellow, brown, black, or, sometimes, pitted, in, most, cases, the, enamel, defects, caused, by, celiac, disease, which, may, be, the, only, manifestation, of, this, disease, in, the, absence, of, any, other, symptoms, or, signs, are, not, recognized, and, mistakenly, attributed, to, other, causes, such, as, fluorosis, enamel, hypoplasia, resulting, from, syphilis, is, frequently, referred, to, as, hutchinson, s, teeth, which, is, considered, one, part, of, hutchinson, s, triad, turner, s, hypoplasia, is, a, portion, of, missing, or, diminished, enamel, on, a, permanent, tooth, usually, from, a, prior, infection, of, a, nearby, primary, tooth, hypoplasia, may, also, result, from, antineoplastic, therapy, tooth, destruction, from, processes, other, than, dental, caries, is, considered, a, normal, physiologic, process, but, may, become, severe, enough, to, become, a, pathologic, condition, attrition, is, the, loss, of, tooth, structure, by, mechanical, forces, from, opposing, teeth, attrition, initially, affects, the, enamel, and, if, unchecked, may, proceed, to, the, underlying, dentin, abrasion, is, the, loss, of, tooth, structure, by, mechanical, forces, from, a, foreign, element, if, this, force, begins, at, the, cementoenamel, junction, then, progression, of, tooth, loss, can, be, rapid, since, enamel, is, very, thin, in, this, region, of, the, tooth, a, common, source, of, this, type, of, tooth, wear, is, excessive, force, when, using, a, toothbrush, erosion, is, the, loss, of, tooth, structure, due, to, chemical, dissolution, by, acids, not, of, bacterial, origin, signs, of, tooth, destruction, from, erosion, is, a, common, characteristic, in, the, mouths, of, people, with, bulimia, since, vomiting, results, in, exposure, of, the, teeth, to, gastric, acids, another, important, source, of, erosive, acids, are, from, frequent, sucking, of, lemon, juice, abfraction, is, the, loss, of, tooth, structure, from, flexural, forces, as, teeth, flex, under, pressure, the, arrangement, of, teeth, touching, each, other, known, as, occlusion, causes, tension, on, one, side, of, the, tooth, and, compression, on, the, other, side, of, the, tooth, this, is, believed, to, cause, v, shaped, depressions, on, the, side, under, tension, and, c, shaped, depressions, on, the, side, under, compression, when, tooth, destruction, occurs, at, the, roots, of, teeth, the, process, is, referred, to, as, internal, resorption, when, caused, by, cells, within, the, pulp, or, external, resorption, when, caused, by, cells, in, the, periodontal, ligament, discoloration, of, teeth, may, result, from, bacteria, stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods, with, an, abundance, of, chlorophyll, restorative, materials, and, medications, stains, from, bacteria, may, cause, colors, varying, from, green, to, black, to, orange, green, stains, also, result, from, foods, with, chlorophyll, or, excessive, exposure, to, copper, or, nickel, amalgam, a, common, dental, restorative, material, may, turn, adjacent, areas, of, teeth, black, or, gray, long, term, use, of, chlorhexidine, a, mouthwash, may, encourage, extrinsic, stain, formation, near, the, gingiva, on, teeth, this, is, usually, easy, for, a, hygienist, to, remove, systemic, disorders, also, can, cause, tooth, discoloration, congenital, erythropoietic, porphyria, causes, porphyrins, to, be, deposited, in, teeth, causing, a, red, brown, coloration, blue, discoloration, may, occur, with, alkaptonuria, and, rarely, with, parkinson, s, disease, erythroblastosis, fetalis, and, biliary, atresia, are, diseases, which, may, cause, teeth, to, appear, green, from, the, deposition, of, biliverdin, also, trauma, may, change, a, tooth, to, a, pink, yellow, or, dark, gray, color, pink, and, red, discolorations, are, also, associated, in, patients, with, lepromatous, leprosy, some, medications, such, as, tetracycline, antibiotics, may, become, incorporated, into, the, structure, of, a, tooth, causing, intrinsic, staining, of, the, teeth, tooth, eruption, may, be, altered, by, some, environmental, factors, when, eruption, is, prematurely, stopped, the, tooth, is, said, to, be, impacted, the, most, common, cause, of, tooth, impaction, is, lack, of, space, in, the, mouth, for, the, tooth, other, causes, may, be, tumors, cysts, trauma, and, thickened, bone, or, soft, tissue, tooth, ankylosis, occurs, when, the, tooth, has, already, erupted, into, the, mouth, but, the, cementum, or, dentin, has, fused, with, the, alveolar, bone, this, may, cause, a, person, to, retain, their, primary, tooth, instead, of, having, it, replaced, by, a, permanent, one, a, technique, for, altering, the, natural, progression, of, eruption, is, employed, by, orthodontists, who, wish, to, delay, or, speed, up, the, eruption, of, certain, teeth, for, reasons, of, space, maintenance, or, otherwise, preventing, crowding, and, or, spacing, if, a, primary, tooth, is, extracted, before, its, succeeding, permanent, tooth, s, root, reaches, of, its, total, growth, the, eruption, of, the, permanent, tooth, will, be, delayed, conversely, if, the, roots, of, the, permanent, tooth, are, more, than, complete, the, eruption, of, the, permanent, tooth, will, be, accelerated, between, and, it, is, unknown, exactly, what, will, occur, to, the, speed, of, eruption, some, systemic, disorders, which, may, result, in, hyperdontia, include, apert, syndrome, cleidocranial, dysostosis, crouzon, syndrome, ehlers, danlos, syndrome, gardner, s, syndrome, and, sturge, weber, syndrome, some, systemic, disorders, which, may, result, in, hypodontia, include, crouzon, syndrome, ectodermal, dysplasia, ehlers, danlos, syndrome, and, gorlin, syndrome, microdontia, of, a, single, tooth, is, more, likely, to, occur, in, a, maxillary, lateral, incisor, the, second, most, likely, tooth, to, have, microdontia, are, third, molars, macrodontia, of, all, the, teeth, is, known, to, occur, in, pituitary, gigantism, and, pineal, hyperplasia, it, may, also, occur, on, one, side, of, the, face, in, cases, of, hemifacial, hyperplasia, there, are, many, types, of, dental, anomalies, seen, in, cleft, lip, and, palate, clp, patients, both, sets, of, dentition, may, be, affected, however, they, are, commonly, seen, in, the, affected, side, most, frequently, missing, teeth, supernumerary, or, discoloured, teeth, can, be, seen, however, enamel, dysplasia, discolouration, and, delayed, root, development, are, also, common, in, children, with, cleft, lip, and, palate, the, lateral, incisor, in, the, alveolar, cleft, region, has, the, highest, prevalence, of, dental, developmental, disorders, this, condition, may, be, a, cause, of, tooth, crowding, this, is, important, to, consider, in, order, to, correctly, plan, treatment, keeping, in, mind, considerations, for, function, and, aesthetics, by, correctly, coordinating, management, invasive, treatment, procedures, can, be, prevented, resulting, in, successful, and, conservative, treatment, there, have, been, a, plethora, of, research, studies, to, calculate, prevalence, of, certain, dental, anomalies, in, clp, populations, however, a, variety, of, results, have, been, obtained, in, a, study, evaluating, dental, anomalies, in, brazilian, cleft, patients, male, patients, had, a, higher, incidence, of, clp, agenesis, and, supernumerary, teeth, than, did, female, patients, in, cases, of, complete, clp, the, left, maxillary, lateral, incisor, was, the, most, commonly, absent, tooth, supernumerary, teeth, were, typically, located, distal, to, the, cleft, in, a, study, of, jordanian, subjects, the, prevalence, of, dental, anomaly, was, higher, in, clp, patients, than, in, normal, subjects, missing, teeth, were, observed, in, 66, 7, of, patients, with, maxillary, lateral, incisor, as, the, most, frequently, affected, tooth, supernumerary, teeth, were, observed, in, 16, 7, of, patients, other, findings, included, microdontia, 37, taurodontism, 70, 5, transposition, or, ectopic, teeth, 30, 8, dilacerations, 19, 2, and, hypoplasia, 30, 8, the, incidence, of, microdontia, dilaceration, and, hypoplasia, was, significantly, higher, in, bilateral, clp, patients, than, in, unilateral, clp, patients, and, none, of, the, anomalies, showed, any, significant, sexual, dimorphism, it, is, therefore, evident, that, patients, with, cleft, lip, and, palate, may, present, with, a, variety, of, dental, anomalies, it, is, essential, to, assess, the, patient, both, clinically, and, radiographically, in, order, to, correctly, treat, and, prevent, progression, of, any, dental, problems, it, is, also, useful, to, note, that, patients, with, a, cleft, lip, and, palate, automatically, score, a, 5, on, the, iotn, index, for, orthodontic, need, and, therefore, are, eligible, for, orthodontic, treatment, liaising, with, an, orthodontist, is, vital, in, order, coordinate, and, plan, treatment, successfully
