proteins, are, large, biomolecules, and, macromolecules, that, comprise, one, or, more, long, chains, of, amino, acid, residues, proteins, perform, a, vast, array, of, functions, within, organisms, including, catalysing, metabolic, reactions, dna, replication, responding, to, stimuli, providing, structure, to, cells, and, organisms, and, transporting, molecules, from, one, location, to, another, proteins, differ, from, one, another, primarily, in, their, sequence, of, amino, acids, which, is, dictated, by, the, nucleotide, sequence, of, their, genes, and, which, usually, results, in, protein, folding, into, a, specific, 3d, structure, that, determines, its, activity, a, linear, chain, of, amino, acid, residues, is, called, a, polypeptide, a, protein, contains, at, least, one, long, polypeptide, short, polypeptides, containing, less, than, 20, 30, residues, are, rarely, considered, to, be, proteins, and, are, commonly, called, peptides, the, individual, amino, acid, residues, are, bonded, together, by, peptide, bonds, and, adjacent, amino, acid, residues, the, sequence, of, amino, acid, residues, in, a, protein, is, defined, by, the, sequence, of, a, gene, which, is, encoded, in, the, genetic, code, in, general, the, genetic, code, specifies, 20, standard, amino, acids, but, in, certain, organisms, the, genetic, code, can, include, selenocysteine, and, in, certain, archaea, pyrrolysine, shortly, after, or, even, during, synthesis, the, residues, in, a, protein, are, often, chemically, modified, by, post, translational, modification, which, alters, the, physical, and, chemical, properties, folding, stability, activity, and, ultimately, the, function, of, the, proteins, some, proteins, have, non, peptide, groups, attached, which, can, be, called, prosthetic, groups, or, cofactors, proteins, can, also, work, together, to, achieve, a, particular, function, and, they, often, associate, to, form, stable, protein, complexes, once, formed, proteins, only, exist, for, a, certain, period, and, are, then, degraded, and, recycled, by, the, cell, s, machinery, through, the, process, of, protein, turnover, a, protein, s, lifespan, is, measured, in, terms, of, its, half, life, and, covers, a, wide, range, they, can, exist, for, minutes, or, years, with, an, average, lifespan, of, 1, 2, days, in, mammalian, cells, abnormal, or, misfolded, proteins, are, degraded, more, rapidly, either, due, to, being, targeted, for, destruction, or, due, to, being, unstable, like, other, biological, macromolecules, such, as, polysaccharides, and, nucleic, acids, proteins, are, essential, parts, of, organisms, and, participate, in, virtually, every, process, within, cells, many, proteins, are, enzymes, that, catalyse, biochemical, reactions, and, are, vital, to, metabolism, proteins, also, have, structural, or, mechanical, functions, such, as, actin, and, myosin, in, muscle, and, the, proteins, in, the, cytoskeleton, which, form, a, system, of, scaffolding, that, maintains, cell, shape, other, proteins, are, important, in, cell, signaling, immune, responses, cell, adhesion, and, the, cell, cycle, in, animals, proteins, are, needed, in, the, diet, to, provide, the, essential, amino, acids, that, cannot, be, synthesized, digestion, breaks, the, proteins, down, for, metabolic, use, proteins, have, been, studied, and, recognized, since, the, 1700s, by, antoine, fourcroy, and, others, who, often, collectively, called, them, albumins, or, albuminous, materials, eiweissk, rper, in, german, gluten, for, example, was, first, separated, from, wheat, in, published, research, around, 1747, and, later, determined, to, exist, in, many, plants, in, 1789, antoine, fourcroy, recognized, three, distinct, varieties, of, animal, proteins, albumin, fibrin, and, gelatin, vegetable, plant, proteins, studied, in, the, late, 1700s, and, early, 1800s, included, gluten, plant, albumin, gliadin, and, legumin, proteins, were, first, described, by, the, dutch, chemist, gerardus, johannes, mulder, and, named, by, the, swedish, chemist, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, in, 1838, mulder, carried, out, elemental, analysis, of, common, proteins, and, found, that, nearly, all, proteins, had, the, same, empirical, formula, c, 400, h, 620, n, 100, o, 120, p, 1, s, 1, he, came, to, the, erroneous, conclusion, that, they, might, be, composed, of, a, single, type, of, very, large, molecule, the, term, protein, to, describe, these, molecules, was, proposed, by, mulder, s, associate, berzelius, protein, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, proteios, meaning, primary, in, the, lead, or, standing, in, front, in, mulder, went, on, to, identify, the, products, of, protein, degradation, such, as, the, amino, acid, leucine, for, which, he, found, a, nearly, correct, molecular, weight, of, 131, da, early, nutritional, scientists, such, as, the, german, carl, von, voit, believed, that, protein, was, the, most, important, nutrient, for, maintaining, the, structure, of, the, body, because, it, was, generally, believed, that, flesh, makes, flesh, around, 1862, karl, heinrich, ritthausen, isolated, the, amino, acid, glutamic, acid, thomas, burr, osborne, compiled, a, detailed, review, of, the, vegetable, proteins, at, the, connecticut, agricultural, experiment, station, then, working, with, lafayette, mendel, and, applying, liebig, s, law, of, the, minimum, which, states, that, growth, is, limited, by, the, scarcest, resource, to, the, feeding, of, laboratory, rats, the, nutritionally, essential, amino, acids, were, established, the, work, was, continued, and, communicated, by, william, cumming, rose, the, difficulty, in, purifying, proteins, in, large, quantities, made, them, very, difficult, for, early, protein, biochemists, to, study, hence, early, studies, focused, on, proteins, that, could, be, purified, in, large, quantities, including, those, of, blood, egg, whites, and, various, toxins, as, well, as, digestive, and, metabolic, enzymes, obtained, from, slaughterhouses, in, the, 1950s, the, armour, hot, dog, company, purified, 1, kg, of, pure, bovine, pancreatic, ribonuclease, a, and, made, it, freely, available, to, scientists, this, gesture, helped, ribonuclease, a, become, a, major, target, for, biochemical, study, for, the, following, decades, the, understanding, of, proteins, as, polypeptides, or, chains, of, amino, acids, came, through, the, work, of, franz, hofmeister, and, hermann, emil, fischer, in, 1902, the, central, role, of, proteins, as, enzymes, in, living, organisms, that, catalyzed, reactions, was, not, fully, appreciated, until, 1926, when, james, b, sumner, showed, that, the, enzyme, urease, was, in, fact, a, protein, linus, pauling, is, credited, with, the, successful, prediction, of, regular, protein, secondary, structures, based, on, hydrogen, bonding, an, idea, first, put, forth, by, william, astbury, in, 1933, later, work, by, walter, kauzmann, on, denaturation, based, partly, on, previous, studies, by, kaj, linderstr, m, lang, contributed, an, understanding, of, protein, folding, and, structure, mediated, by, hydrophobic, interactions, the, first, protein, to, have, its, amino, acid, chain, sequenced, was, insulin, by, frederick, sanger, in, 1949, sanger, correctly, determined, the, amino, acid, sequence, of, insulin, thus, conclusively, demonstrating, that, proteins, consisted, of, linear, polymers, of, amino, acids, rather, than, branched, chains, colloids, or, cyclols, he, won, the, nobel, prize, for, this, achievement, in, 1958, christian, anfinsen, s, studies, of, the, oxidative, folding, process, of, ribonuclease, a, for, which, he, won, the, nobel, prize, in, 1972, solidified, the, thermodynamic, hypothesis, of, protein, folding, according, to, which, the, folded, form, of, a, protein, represents, its, free, energy, minimum, with, the, development, of, x, ray, crystallography, it, became, possible, to, determine, protein, structures, as, well, as, their, sequences, the, first, protein, structures, to, be, solved, were, hemoglobin, by, max, perutz, and, myoglobin, by, john, kendrew, in, 1958, the, use, of, computers, and, increasing, computing, power, also, supported, the, sequencing, of, complex, proteins, in, 1999, roger, kornberg, succeeded, in, sequencing, the, highly, complex, structure, of, rna, polymerase, using, high, intensity, x, rays, from, synchrotrons, since, then, cryo, electron, microscopy, cryo, em, of, large, macromolecular, assemblies, has, been, developed, cryo, em, uses, protein, samples, that, are, frozen, rather, than, crystals, and, beams, of, electrons, rather, than, x, rays, it, causes, less, damage, to, the, sample, allowing, scientists, to, obtain, more, information, and, analyze, larger, structures, computational, protein, structure, prediction, of, small, protein, structural, domains, has, also, helped, researchers, to, approach, atomic, level, resolution, of, protein, structures, as, of, april, 2024, the, protein, data, bank, contains, 181, 018, x, ray, 19, 809, em, and, 12, 697, nmr, protein, structures, proteins, are, primarily, classified, by, sequence, and, structure, although, other, classifications, are, commonly, used, especially, for, enzymes, the, ec, number, system, provides, a, functional, classification, scheme, similarly, the, gene, ontology, classifies, both, genes, and, proteins, by, their, biological, and, biochemical, function, but, also, by, their, intracellular, location, sequence, similarity, is, used, to, classify, proteins, both, in, terms, of, evolutionary, and, functional, similarity, this, may, use, either, whole, proteins, or, protein, domains, especially, in, multi, domain, proteins, protein, domains, allow, protein, classification, by, a, combination, of, sequence, structure, and, function, and, they, can, be, combined, in, many, different, ways, in, an, early, study, of, 170, 000, proteins, about, two, thirds, were, assigned, at, least, one, domain, with, larger, proteins, containing, more, domains, e, g, proteins, larger, than, 600, amino, acids, having, an, average, of, more, than, 5, domains, most, proteins, consist, of, linear, polymers, built, from, series, of, up, to, 20, different, l, amino, acids, all, proteinogenic, amino, acids, possess, common, structural, features, including, an, carbon, to, which, an, amino, group, a, carboxyl, group, and, a, variable, side, chain, are, bonded, only, proline, differs, from, this, basic, structure, as, it, contains, an, unusual, ring, to, the, n, end, amine, group, which, forces, the, co, nh, amide, moiety, into, a, fixed, conformation, the, side, chains, of, the, standard, amino, acids, detailed, in, the, list, of, standard, amino, acids, have, a, great, variety, of, chemical, structures, and, properties, it, is, the, combined, effect, of, all, of, the, amino, acid, side, chains, in, a, protein, that, ultimately, determines, its, three, dimensional, structure, and, its, chemical, reactivity, the, amino, acids, in, a, polypeptide, chain, are, linked, by, peptide, bonds, once, linked, in, the, protein, chain, an, individual, amino, acid, is, called, a, residue, and, the, linked, series, of, carbon, nitrogen, and, oxygen, atoms, are, known, as, the, main, chain, or, protein, backbone, 19, the, peptide, bond, has, two, resonance, forms, that, contribute, some, double, bond, character, and, inhibit, rotation, around, its, axis, so, that, the, alpha, carbons, are, roughly, coplanar, the, other, two, dihedral, angles, in, the, peptide, bond, determine, the, local, shape, assumed, by, the, protein, backbone, 31, the, end, with, a, free, amino, group, is, known, as, the, n, terminus, or, amino, terminus, whereas, the, end, of, the, protein, with, a, free, carboxyl, group, is, known, as, the, c, terminus, or, carboxy, terminus, the, sequence, of, the, protein, is, written, from, n, terminus, to, c, terminus, from, left, to, right, the, words, protein, polypeptide, and, peptide, are, a, little, ambiguous, and, can, overlap, in, meaning, protein, is, generally, used, to, refer, to, the, complete, biological, molecule, in, a, stable, conformation, whereas, peptide, is, generally, reserved, for, a, short, amino, acid, oligomers, often, lacking, a, stable, 3d, structure, but, the, boundary, between, the, two, is, not, well, defined, and, usually, lies, near, 20, 30, residues, polypeptide, can, refer, to, any, single, linear, chain, of, amino, acids, usually, regardless, of, length, but, often, implies, an, absence, of, a, defined, conformation, proteins, can, interact, with, many, types, of, molecules, including, with, other, proteins, with, lipids, with, carbohydrates, and, with, dna, it, has, been, estimated, that, average, sized, bacteria, contain, about, 2, million, proteins, per, cell, e, g, e, coli, and, staphylococcus, aureus, smaller, bacteria, such, as, mycoplasma, or, spirochetes, contain, fewer, molecules, on, the, order, of, 50, 000, to, 1, million, by, contrast, eukaryotic, cells, are, larger, and, thus, contain, much, more, protein, for, instance, yeast, cells, have, been, estimated, to, contain, about, 50, million, proteins, and, human, cells, on, the, order, of, 1, to, 3, billion, the, concentration, of, individual, protein, copies, ranges, from, a, few, molecules, per, cell, up, to, 20, million, not, all, genes, coding, proteins, are, expressed, in, most, cells, and, their, number, depends, on, for, example, cell, type, and, external, stimuli, for, instance, of, the, 20, 000, or, so, proteins, encoded, by, the, human, genome, only, 6, 000, are, detected, in, lymphoblastoid, cells, proteins, are, assembled, from, amino, acids, using, information, encoded, in, genes, each, protein, has, its, own, unique, amino, acid, sequence, that, is, specified, by, the, nucleotide, sequence, of, the, gene, encoding, this, protein, the, genetic, code, is, a, set, of, three, nucleotide, sets, called, codons, and, each, three, nucleotide, combination, designates, an, amino, acid, for, example, aug, adenine, uracil, guanine, is, the, code, for, methionine, because, dna, contains, four, nucleotides, the, total, number, of, possible, codons, is, 64, hence, there, is, some, redundancy, in, the, genetic, code, with, some, amino, acids, specified, by, more, than, one, codon, 1002, 42, genes, encoded, in, dna, are, first, transcribed, into, pre, messenger, rna, mrna, by, proteins, such, as, rna, polymerase, most, organisms, then, process, the, pre, mrna, also, known, as, a, primary, transcript, using, various, forms, of, post, transcriptional, modification, to, form, the, mature, mrna, which, is, then, used, as, a, template, for, protein, synthesis, by, the, ribosome, in, prokaryotes, the, mrna, may, either, be, used, as, soon, as, it, is, produced, or, be, bound, by, a, ribosome, after, having, moved, away, from, the, nucleoid, in, contrast, eukaryotes, make, mrna, in, the, cell, nucleus, and, then, translocate, it, across, the, nuclear, membrane, into, the, cytoplasm, where, protein, synthesis, then, takes, place, the, rate, of, protein, synthesis, is, higher, in, prokaryotes, than, eukaryotes, and, can, reach, up, to, 20, amino, acids, per, second, the, process, of, synthesizing, a, protein, from, an, mrna, template, is, known, as, translation, the, mrna, is, loaded, onto, the, ribosome, and, is, read, three, nucleotides, at, a, time, by, matching, each, codon, to, its, base, pairing, anticodon, located, on, a, transfer, rna, molecule, which, carries, the, amino, acid, corresponding, to, the, codon, it, recognizes, the, enzyme, aminoacyl, trna, synthetase, charges, the, trna, molecules, with, the, correct, amino, acids, the, growing, polypeptide, is, often, termed, the, nascent, chain, proteins, are, always, biosynthesized, from, n, terminus, to, c, terminus, 1002, 42, the, size, of, a, synthesized, protein, can, be, measured, by, the, number, of, amino, acids, it, contains, and, by, its, total, molecular, mass, which, is, normally, reported, in, units, of, daltons, synonymous, with, atomic, mass, units, or, the, derivative, unit, kilodalton, kda, the, average, size, of, a, protein, increases, from, archaea, to, bacteria, to, eukaryote, 283, 311, 438, residues, and, 31, 34, 49, kda, respectively, due, to, a, bigger, number, of, protein, domains, constituting, proteins, in, higher, organisms, for, instance, yeast, proteins, are, on, average, 466, amino, acids, long, and, 53, kda, in, mass, the, largest, known, proteins, are, the, titins, a, component, of, the, muscle, sarcomere, with, a, molecular, mass, of, almost, 3, 000, kda, and, a, total, length, of, almost, 27, 000, amino, acids, short, proteins, can, also, be, synthesized, chemically, by, a, family, of, methods, known, as, peptide, synthesis, which, rely, on, organic, synthesis, techniques, such, as, chemical, ligation, to, produce, peptides, in, high, yield, chemical, synthesis, allows, for, the, introduction, of, non, natural, amino, acids, into, polypeptide, chains, such, as, attachment, of, fluorescent, probes, to, amino, acid, side, chains, these, methods, are, useful, in, laboratory, biochemistry, and, cell, biology, though, generally, not, for, commercial, applications, chemical, synthesis, is, inefficient, for, polypeptides, longer, than, about, 300, amino, acids, and, the, synthesized, proteins, may, not, readily, assume, their, native, tertiary, structure, most, chemical, synthesis, methods, proceed, from, c, terminus, to, n, terminus, opposite, the, biological, reaction, most, proteins, fold, into, unique, 3d, structures, the, shape, into, which, a, protein, naturally, folds, is, known, as, its, native, conformation, 36, although, many, proteins, can, fold, unassisted, simply, through, the, chemical, properties, of, their, amino, acids, others, require, the, aid, of, molecular, chaperones, to, fold, into, their, native, states, 37, biochemists, often, refer, to, four, distinct, aspects, of, a, protein, s, structure, 30, 34, proteins, are, not, entirely, rigid, molecules, in, addition, to, these, levels, of, structure, proteins, may, shift, between, several, related, structures, while, they, perform, their, functions, in, the, context, of, these, functional, rearrangements, these, tertiary, or, quaternary, structures, are, usually, referred, to, as, conformations, and, transitions, between, them, are, called, conformational, changes, such, changes, are, often, induced, by, the, binding, of, a, substrate, molecule, to, an, enzyme, s, active, site, or, the, physical, region, of, the, protein, that, participates, in, chemical, catalysis, in, solution, proteins, also, undergo, variation, in, structure, through, thermal, vibration, and, the, collision, with, other, molecules, 368, 75, proteins, can, be, informally, divided, into, three, main, classes, which, correlate, with, typical, tertiary, structures, globular, proteins, fibrous, proteins, and, membrane, proteins, almost, all, globular, proteins, are, soluble, and, many, are, enzymes, fibrous, proteins, are, often, structural, such, as, collagen, the, major, component, of, connective, tissue, or, keratin, the, protein, component, of, hair, and, nails, membrane, proteins, often, serve, as, receptors, or, provide, channels, for, polar, or, charged, molecules, to, pass, through, the, cell, membrane, 165, 85, a, special, case, of, intramolecular, hydrogen, bonds, within, proteins, poorly, shielded, from, water, attack, and, hence, promoting, their, own, dehydration, are, called, dehydrons, many, proteins, are, composed, of, several, protein, domains, i, e, segments, of, a, protein, that, fold, into, distinct, structural, units, domains, usually, also, have, specific, functions, such, as, enzymatic, activities, e, g, kinase, or, they, serve, as, binding, modules, e, g, the, sh3, domain, binds, to, proline, rich, sequences, in, other, proteins, short, amino, acid, sequences, within, proteins, often, act, as, recognition, sites, for, other, proteins, for, instance, sh3, domains, typically, bind, to, short, pxxp, motifs, i, e, 2, prolines, separated, by, two, unspecified, amino, acids, although, the, surrounding, amino, acids, may, determine, the, exact, binding, specificity, many, such, motifs, has, been, collected, in, the, eukaryotic, linear, motif, elm, database, topology, of, a, protein, describes, the, entanglement, of, the, backbone, and, the, arrangement, of, contacts, within, the, folded, chain, two, theoretical, frameworks, of, knot, theory, and, circuit, topology, have, been, applied, to, characterise, protein, topology, being, able, to, describe, protein, topology, opens, up, new, pathways, for, protein, engineering, and, pharmaceutical, development, and, adds, to, our, understanding, of, protein, misfolding, diseases, such, as, neuromuscular, disorders, and, cancer, proteins, are, the, chief, actors, within, the, cell, said, to, be, carrying, out, the, duties, specified, by, the, information, encoded, in, genes, with, the, exception, of, certain, types, of, rna, most, other, biological, molecules, are, relatively, inert, elements, upon, which, proteins, act, proteins, make, up, half, the, dry, weight, of, an, escherichia, coli, cell, whereas, other, macromolecules, such, as, dna, and, rna, make, up, only, 3, and, 20, respectively, the, set, of, proteins, expressed, in, a, particular, cell, or, cell, type, is, known, as, its, proteome, the, chief, characteristic, of, proteins, that, also, allows, their, diverse, set, of, functions, is, their, ability, to, bind, other, molecules, specifically, and, tightly, the, region, of, the, protein, responsible, for, binding, another, molecule, is, known, as, the, binding, site, and, is, often, a, depression, or, pocket, on, the, molecular, surface, this, binding, ability, is, mediated, by, the, tertiary, structure, of, the, protein, which, defines, the, binding, site, pocket, and, by, the, chemical, properties, of, the, surrounding, amino, acids, side, chains, protein, binding, can, be, extraordinarily, tight, and, specific, for, example, the, ribonuclease, inhibitor, protein, binds, to, human, angiogenin, with, a, sub, femtomolar, dissociation, constant, 10, 15, m, but, does, not, bind, at, all, to, its, amphibian, homolog, onconase, 1, m, extremely, minor, chemical, changes, such, as, the, addition, of, a, single, methyl, group, to, a, binding, partner, can, sometimes, suffice, to, nearly, eliminate, binding, for, example, the, aminoacyl, trna, synthetase, specific, to, the, amino, acid, valine, discriminates, against, the, very, similar, side, chain, of, the, amino, acid, isoleucine, proteins, can, bind, to, other, proteins, as, well, as, to, small, molecule, substrates, when, proteins, bind, specifically, to, other, copies, of, the, same, molecule, they, can, oligomerize, to, form, fibrils, this, process, occurs, often, in, structural, proteins, that, consist, of, globular, monomers, that, self, associate, to, form, rigid, fibers, protein, protein, interactions, also, regulate, enzymatic, activity, control, progression, through, the, cell, cycle, and, allow, the, assembly, of, large, protein, complexes, that, carry, out, many, closely, related, reactions, with, a, common, biological, function, proteins, can, also, bind, to, or, even, be, integrated, into, cell, membranes, the, ability, of, binding, partners, to, induce, conformational, changes, in, proteins, allows, the, construction, of, enormously, complex, signaling, networks, 830, 49, as, interactions, between, proteins, are, reversible, and, depend, heavily, on, the, availability, of, different, groups, of, partner, proteins, to, form, aggregates, that, are, capable, to, carry, out, discrete, sets, of, function, study, of, the, interactions, between, specific, proteins, is, a, key, to, understand, important, aspects, of, cellular, function, and, ultimately, the, properties, that, distinguish, particular, cell, types, the, best, known, role, of, proteins, in, the, cell, is, as, enzymes, which, catalyse, chemical, reactions, enzymes, are, usually, highly, specific, and, accelerate, only, one, or, a, few, chemical, reactions, enzymes, carry, out, most, of, the, reactions, involved, in, metabolism, as, well, as, manipulating, dna, in, processes, such, as, dna, replication, dna, repair, and, transcription, some, enzymes, act, on, other, proteins, to, add, or, remove, chemical, groups, in, a, process, known, as, posttranslational, modification, about, 4, 000, reactions, are, known, to, be, catalysed, by, enzymes, the, rate, acceleration, conferred, by, enzymatic, catalysis, is, often, enormous, as, much, as, 10, 17, fold, increase, in, rate, over, the, uncatalysed, reaction, in, the, case, of, orotate, decarboxylase, 78, million, years, without, the, enzyme, 18, milliseconds, with, the, enzyme, the, molecules, bound, and, acted, upon, by, enzymes, are, called, substrates, although, enzymes, can, consist, of, hundreds, of, amino, acids, it, is, usually, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, residues, that, come, in, contact, with, the, substrate, and, an, even, smaller, fraction, three, to, four, residues, on, average, that, are, directly, involved, in, catalysis, the, region, of, the, enzyme, that, binds, the, substrate, and, contains, the, catalytic, residues, is, known, as, the, active, site, dirigent, proteins, are, members, of, a, class, of, proteins, that, dictate, the, stereochemistry, of, a, compound, synthesized, by, other, enzymes, many, proteins, are, involved, in, the, process, of, cell, signaling, and, signal, transduction, some, proteins, such, as, insulin, are, extracellular, proteins, that, transmit, a, signal, from, the, cell, in, which, they, were, synthesized, to, other, cells, in, distant, tissues, others, are, membrane, proteins, that, act, as, receptors, whose, main, function, is, to, bind, a, signaling, molecule, and, induce, a, biochemical, response, in, the, cell, many, receptors, have, a, binding, site, exposed, on, the, cell, surface, and, an, effector, domain, within, the, cell, which, may, have, enzymatic, activity, or, may, undergo, a, conformational, change, detected, by, other, proteins, within, the, cell, 251, 81, antibodies, are, protein, components, of, an, adaptive, immune, system, whose, main, function, is, to, bind, antigens, or, foreign, substances, in, the, body, and, target, them, for, destruction, antibodies, can, be, secreted, into, the, extracellular, environment, or, anchored, in, the, membranes, of, specialized, b, cells, known, as, plasma, cells, whereas, enzymes, are, limited, in, their, binding, affinity, for, their, substrates, by, the, necessity, of, conducting, their, reaction, antibodies, have, no, such, constraints, an, antibody, s, binding, affinity, to, its, target, is, extraordinarily, high, 275, 50, many, ligand, transport, proteins, bind, particular, small, biomolecules, and, transport, them, to, other, locations, in, the, body, of, a, multicellular, organism, these, proteins, must, have, a, high, binding, affinity, when, their, ligand, is, present, in, high, concentrations, but, must, also, release, the, ligand, when, it, is, present, at, low, concentrations, in, the, target, tissues, the, canonical, example, of, a, ligand, binding, protein, is, haemoglobin, which, transports, oxygen, from, the, lungs, to, other, organs, and, tissues, in, all, vertebrates, and, has, close, homologs, in, every, biological, kingdom, 222, 29, lectins, are, sugar, binding, proteins, which, are, highly, specific, for, their, sugar, moieties, lectins, typically, play, a, role, in, biological, recognition, phenomena, involving, cells, and, proteins, receptors, and, hormones, are, highly, specific, binding, proteins, transmembrane, proteins, can, also, serve, as, ligand, transport, proteins, that, alter, the, permeability, of, the, cell, membrane, to, small, molecules, and, ions, the, membrane, alone, has, a, hydrophobic, core, through, which, polar, or, charged, molecules, cannot, diffuse, membrane, proteins, contain, internal, channels, that, allow, such, molecules, to, enter, and, exit, the, cell, many, ion, channel, proteins, are, specialized, to, select, for, only, a, particular, ion, for, example, potassium, and, sodium, channels, often, discriminate, for, only, one, of, the, two, ions, 232, 34, structural, proteins, confer, stiffness, and, rigidity, to, otherwise, fluid, biological, components, most, structural, proteins, are, fibrous, proteins, for, example, collagen, and, elastin, are, critical, components, of, connective, tissue, such, as, cartilage, and, keratin, is, found, in, hard, or, filamentous, structures, such, as, hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and, some, animal, shells, 178, 81, some, globular, proteins, can, also, play, structural, functions, for, example, actin, and, tubulin, are, globular, and, soluble, as, monomers, but, polymerize, to, form, long, stiff, fibers, that, make, up, the, cytoskeleton, which, allows, the, cell, to, maintain, its, shape, and, size, other, proteins, that, serve, structural, functions, are, motor, proteins, such, as, myosin, kinesin, and, dynein, which, are, capable, of, generating, mechanical, forces, these, proteins, are, crucial, for, cellular, motility, of, single, celled, organisms, and, the, sperm, of, many, multicellular, organisms, which, reproduce, sexually, they, also, generate, the, forces, exerted, by, contracting, muscles, 258, 64, 272, and, play, essential, roles, in, intracellular, transport, a, key, question, in, molecular, biology, is, how, proteins, evolve, i, e, how, can, mutations, or, rather, changes, in, amino, acid, sequence, lead, to, new, structures, and, functions, most, amino, acids, in, a, protein, can, be, changed, without, disrupting, activity, or, function, as, can, be, seen, from, numerous, homologous, proteins, across, species, as, collected, in, specialized, databases, for, protein, families, e, g, pfam, in, order, to, prevent, dramatic, consequences, of, mutations, a, gene, may, be, duplicated, before, it, can, mutate, freely, however, this, can, also, lead, to, complete, loss, of, gene, function, and, thus, pseudo, genes, more, commonly, single, amino, acid, changes, have, limited, consequences, although, some, can, change, protein, function, substantially, especially, in, enzymes, for, instance, many, enzymes, can, change, their, substrate, specificity, by, one, or, a, few, mutations, changes, in, substrate, specificity, are, facilitated, by, substrate, promiscuity, i, e, the, ability, of, many, enzymes, to, bind, and, process, multiple, substrates, when, mutations, occur, the, specificity, of, an, enzyme, can, increase, or, decrease, and, thus, its, enzymatic, activity, thus, bacteria, or, other, organisms, can, adapt, to, different, food, sources, including, unnatural, substrates, such, as, plastic, methods, commonly, used, to, study, protein, structure, and, function, include, immunohistochemistry, site, directed, mutagenesis, x, ray, crystallography, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, and, mass, spectrometry, the, activities, and, structures, of, proteins, may, be, examined, in, vitro, in, vivo, and, in, silico, in, vitro, studies, of, purified, proteins, in, controlled, environments, are, useful, for, learning, how, a, protein, carries, out, its, function, for, example, enzyme, kinetics, studies, explore, the, chemical, mechanism, of, an, enzyme, s, catalytic, activity, and, its, relative, affinity, for, various, possible, substrate, molecules, by, contrast, in, vivo, experiments, can, provide, information, about, the, physiological, role, of, a, protein, in, the, context, of, a, cell, or, even, a, whole, organism, in, silico, studies, use, computational, methods, to, study, proteins, proteins, may, be, purified, from, other, cellular, components, using, a, variety, of, techniques, such, as, ultracentrifugation, precipitation, electrophoresis, and, chromatography, the, advent, of, genetic, engineering, has, made, possible, a, number, of, methods, to, facilitate, purification, to, perform, in, vitro, analysis, a, protein, must, be, purified, away, from, other, cellular, components, this, process, usually, begins, with, cell, lysis, in, which, a, cell, s, membrane, is, disrupted, and, its, internal, contents, released, into, a, solution, known, as, a, crude, lysate, the, resulting, mixture, can, be, purified, using, ultracentrifugation, which, fractionates, the, various, cellular, components, into, fractions, containing, soluble, proteins, membrane, lipids, and, proteins, cellular, organelles, and, nucleic, acids, precipitation, by, a, method, known, as, salting, out, can, concentrate, the, proteins, from, this, lysate, various, types, of, chromatography, are, then, used, to, isolate, the, protein, or, proteins, of, interest, based, on, properties, such, as, molecular, weight, net, charge, and, binding, affinity, 21, 24, the, level, of, purification, can, be, monitored, using, various, types, of, gel, electrophoresis, if, the, desired, protein, s, molecular, weight, and, isoelectric, point, are, known, by, spectroscopy, if, the, protein, has, distinguishable, spectroscopic, features, or, by, enzyme, assays, if, the, protein, has, enzymatic, activity, additionally, proteins, can, be, isolated, according, to, their, charge, using, electrofocusing, for, natural, proteins, a, series, of, purification, steps, may, be, necessary, to, obtain, protein, sufficiently, pure, for, laboratory, applications, to, simplify, this, process, genetic, engineering, is, often, used, to, add, chemical, features, to, proteins, that, make, them, easier, to, purify, without, affecting, their, structure, or, activity, here, a, tag, consisting, of, a, specific, amino, acid, sequence, often, a, series, of, histidine, residues, a, his, tag, is, attached, to, one, terminus, of, the, protein, as, a, result, when, the, lysate, is, passed, over, a, chromatography, column, containing, nickel, the, histidine, residues, ligate, the, nickel, and, attach, to, the, column, while, the, untagged, components, of, the, lysate, pass, unimpeded, a, number, of, different, tags, have, been, developed, to, help, researchers, purify, specific, proteins, from, complex, mixtures, the, study, of, proteins, in, vivo, is, often, concerned, with, the, synthesis, and, localization, of, the, protein, within, the, cell, although, many, intracellular, proteins, are, synthesized, in, the, cytoplasm, and, membrane, bound, or, secreted, proteins, in, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, the, specifics, of, how, proteins, are, targeted, to, specific, organelles, or, cellular, structures, is, often, unclear, a, useful, technique, for, assessing, cellular, localization, uses, genetic, engineering, to, express, in, a, cell, a, fusion, protein, or, chimera, consisting, of, the, natural, protein, of, interest, linked, to, a, reporter, such, as, green, fluorescent, protein, gfp, the, fused, protein, s, position, within, the, cell, can, then, be, cleanly, and, efficiently, visualized, using, microscopy, as, shown, in, the, figure, opposite, other, methods, for, elucidating, the, cellular, location, of, proteins, requires, the, use, of, known, compartmental, markers, for, regions, such, as, the, er, the, golgi, lysosomes, or, vacuoles, mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasma, membrane, etc, with, the, use, of, fluorescently, tagged, versions, of, these, markers, or, of, antibodies, to, known, markers, it, becomes, much, simpler, to, identify, the, localization, of, a, protein, of, interest, for, example, indirect, immunofluorescence, will, allow, for, fluorescence, colocalization, and, demonstration, of, location, fluorescent, dyes, are, used, to, label, cellular, compartments, for, a, similar, purpose, other, possibilities, exist, as, well, for, example, immunohistochemistry, usually, uses, an, antibody, to, one, or, more, proteins, of, interest, that, are, conjugated, to, enzymes, yielding, either, luminescent, or, chromogenic, signals, that, can, be, compared, between, samples, allowing, for, localization, information, another, applicable, technique, is, cofractionation, in, sucrose, or, other, material, gradients, using, isopycnic, centrifugation, while, this, technique, does, not, prove, colocalization, of, a, compartment, of, known, density, and, the, protein, of, interest, it, does, increase, the, likelihood, and, is, more, amenable, to, large, scale, studies, finally, the, gold, standard, method, of, cellular, localization, is, immunoelectron, microscopy, this, technique, also, uses, an, antibody, to, the, protein, of, interest, along, with, classical, electron, microscopy, techniques, the, sample, is, prepared, for, normal, electron, microscopic, examination, and, then, treated, with, an, antibody, to, the, protein, of, interest, that, is, conjugated, to, an, extremely, electro, dense, material, usually, gold, this, allows, for, the, localization, of, both, ultrastructural, details, as, well, as, the, protein, of, interest, through, another, genetic, engineering, application, known, as, site, directed, mutagenesis, researchers, can, alter, the, protein, sequence, and, hence, its, structure, cellular, localization, and, susceptibility, to, regulation, this, technique, even, allows, the, incorporation, of, unnatural, amino, acids, into, proteins, using, modified, trnas, and, may, allow, the, rational, design, of, new, proteins, with, novel, properties, the, total, complement, of, proteins, present, at, a, time, in, a, cell, or, cell, type, is, known, as, its, proteome, and, the, study, of, such, large, scale, data, sets, defines, the, field, of, proteomics, named, by, analogy, to, the, related, field, of, genomics, key, experimental, techniques, in, proteomics, include, 2d, electrophoresis, which, allows, the, separation, of, many, proteins, mass, spectrometry, which, allows, rapid, high, throughput, identification, of, proteins, and, sequencing, of, peptides, most, often, after, in, gel, digestion, protein, microarrays, which, allow, the, detection, of, the, relative, levels, of, the, various, proteins, present, in, a, cell, and, two, hybrid, screening, which, allows, the, systematic, exploration, of, protein, protein, interactions, the, total, complement, of, biologically, possible, such, interactions, is, known, as, the, interactome, a, systematic, attempt, to, determine, the, structures, of, proteins, representing, every, possible, fold, is, known, as, structural, genomics, discovering, the, tertiary, structure, of, a, protein, or, the, quaternary, structure, of, its, complexes, can, provide, important, clues, about, how, the, protein, performs, its, function, and, how, it, can, be, affected, i, e, in, drug, design, as, proteins, are, too, small, to, be, seen, under, a, light, microscope, other, methods, have, to, be, employed, to, determine, their, structure, common, experimental, methods, include, x, ray, crystallography, and, nmr, spectroscopy, both, of, which, can, produce, structural, information, at, atomic, resolution, however, nmr, experiments, are, able, to, provide, information, from, which, a, subset, of, distances, between, pairs, of, atoms, can, be, estimated, and, the, final, possible, conformations, for, a, protein, are, determined, by, solving, a, distance, geometry, problem, dual, polarisation, interferometry, is, a, quantitative, analytical, method, for, measuring, the, overall, protein, conformation, and, conformational, changes, due, to, interactions, or, other, stimulus, circular, dichroism, is, another, laboratory, technique, for, determining, internal, sheet, helical, composition, of, proteins, cryoelectron, microscopy, is, used, to, produce, lower, resolution, structural, information, about, very, large, protein, complexes, including, assembled, viruses, 340, 41, a, variant, known, as, electron, crystallography, can, also, produce, high, resolution, information, in, some, cases, especially, for, two, dimensional, crystals, of, membrane, proteins, solved, structures, are, usually, deposited, in, the, protein, data, bank, pdb, a, freely, available, resource, from, which, structural, data, about, thousands, of, proteins, can, be, obtained, in, the, form, of, cartesian, coordinates, for, each, atom, in, the, protein, many, more, gene, sequences, are, known, than, protein, structures, further, the, set, of, solved, structures, is, biased, toward, proteins, that, can, be, easily, subjected, to, the, conditions, required, in, x, ray, crystallography, one, of, the, major, structure, determination, methods, in, particular, globular, proteins, are, comparatively, easy, to, crystallize, in, preparation, for, x, ray, crystallography, membrane, proteins, and, large, protein, complexes, by, contrast, are, difficult, to, crystallize, and, are, underrepresented, in, the, pdb, structural, genomics, initiatives, have, attempted, to, remedy, these, deficiencies, by, systematically, solving, representative, structures, of, major, fold, classes, protein, structure, prediction, methods, attempt, to, provide, a, means, of, generating, a, plausible, structure, for, proteins, whose, structures, have, not, been, experimentally, determined, complementary, to, the, field, of, structural, genomics, protein, structure, prediction, develops, efficient, mathematical, models, of, proteins, to, computationally, predict, the, molecular, formations, in, theory, instead, of, detecting, structures, with, laboratory, observation, the, most, successful, type, of, structure, prediction, known, as, homology, modeling, relies, on, the, existence, of, a, template, structure, with, sequence, similarity, to, the, protein, being, modeled, structural, genomics, goal, is, to, provide, sufficient, representation, in, solved, structures, to, model, most, of, those, that, remain, although, producing, accurate, models, remains, a, challenge, when, only, distantly, related, template, structures, are, available, it, has, been, suggested, that, sequence, alignment, is, the, bottleneck, in, this, process, as, quite, accurate, models, can, be, produced, if, a, perfect, sequence, alignment, is, known, many, structure, prediction, methods, have, served, to, inform, the, emerging, field, of, protein, engineering, in, which, novel, protein, folds, have, already, been, designed, also, proteins, in, eukaryotes, 33, contain, large, unstructured, but, biologically, functional, segments, and, can, be, classified, as, intrinsically, disordered, proteins, predicting, and, analysing, protein, disorder, is, therefore, an, important, part, of, protein, structure, characterisation, a, vast, array, of, computational, methods, have, been, developed, to, analyze, the, structure, function, and, evolution, of, proteins, the, development, of, such, tools, has, been, driven, by, the, large, amount, of, genomic, and, proteomic, data, available, for, a, variety, of, organisms, including, the, human, genome, it, is, simply, impossible, to, study, all, proteins, experimentally, hence, only, a, few, are, subjected, to, laboratory, experiments, while, computational, tools, are, used, to, extrapolate, to, similar, proteins, such, homologous, proteins, can, be, efficiently, identified, in, distantly, related, organisms, by, sequence, alignment, genome, and, gene, sequences, can, be, searched, by, a, variety, of, tools, for, certain, properties, sequence, profiling, tools, can, find, restriction, enzyme, sites, open, reading, frames, in, nucleotide, sequences, and, predict, secondary, structures, phylogenetic, trees, can, be, constructed, and, evolutionary, hypotheses, developed, using, special, software, like, clustalw, regarding, the, ancestry, of, modern, organisms, and, the, genes, they, express, the, field, of, bioinformatics, is, now, indispensable, for, the, analysis, of, genes, and, proteins, a, more, complex, computational, problem, is, the, prediction, of, intermolecular, interactions, such, as, in, molecular, docking, protein, folding, protein, protein, interaction, and, chemical, reactivity, mathematical, models, to, simulate, these, dynamical, processes, involve, molecular, mechanics, in, particular, molecular, dynamics, in, this, regard, in, silico, simulations, discovered, the, folding, of, small, helical, protein, domains, such, as, the, villin, headpiece, the, hiv, accessory, protein, and, hybrid, methods, combining, standard, molecular, dynamics, with, quantum, mechanical, mathematics, have, explored, the, electronic, states, of, rhodopsins, beyond, classical, molecular, dynamics, quantum, dynamics, methods, allow, the, simulation, of, proteins, in, atomistic, detail, with, an, accurate, description, of, quantum, mechanical, effects, examples, include, the, multi, layer, multi, configuration, time, dependent, hartree, mctdh, method, and, the, hierarchical, equations, of, motion, heom, approach, which, have, been, applied, to, plant, cryptochromes, and, bacteria, light, harvesting, complexes, respectively, both, quantum, and, classical, mechanical, simulations, of, biological, scale, systems, are, extremely, computationally, demanding, so, distributed, computing, initiatives, for, example, the, folding, home, project, facilitate, the, molecular, modeling, by, exploiting, advances, in, gpu, parallel, processing, and, monte, carlo, techniques, the, total, nitrogen, content, of, organic, matter, is, mainly, formed, by, the, amino, groups, in, proteins, the, total, kjeldahl, nitrogen, tkn, is, a, measure, of, nitrogen, widely, used, in, the, analysis, of, waste, water, soil, food, feed, and, organic, matter, in, general, as, the, name, suggests, the, kjeldahl, method, is, applied, more, sensitive, methods, are, available, most, microorganisms, and, plants, can, biosynthesize, all, 20, standard, amino, acids, while, animals, including, humans, must, obtain, some, of, the, amino, acids, from, the, diet, the, amino, acids, that, an, organism, cannot, synthesize, on, its, own, are, referred, to, as, essential, amino, acids, key, enzymes, that, synthesize, certain, amino, acids, are, not, present, in, animals, such, as, aspartokinase, which, catalyses, the, first, step, in, the, synthesis, of, lysine, methionine, and, threonine, from, aspartate, if, amino, acids, are, present, in, the, environment, microorganisms, can, conserve, energy, by, taking, up, the, amino, acids, from, their, surroundings, and, downregulating, their, biosynthetic, pathways, in, animals, amino, acids, are, obtained, through, the, consumption, of, foods, containing, protein, ingested, proteins, are, then, broken, down, into, amino, acids, through, digestion, which, typically, involves, denaturation, of, the, protein, through, exposure, to, acid, and, hydrolysis, by, enzymes, called, proteases, some, ingested, amino, acids, are, used, for, protein, biosynthesis, while, others, are, converted, to, glucose, through, gluconeogenesis, or, fed, into, the, citric, acid, cycle, this, use, of, protein, as, a, fuel, is, particularly, important, under, starvation, conditions, as, it, allows, the, body, s, own, proteins, to, be, used, to, support, life, particularly, those, found, in, muscle, in, animals, such, as, dogs, and, cats, protein, maintains, the, health, and, quality, of, the, skin, by, promoting, hair, follicle, growth, and, keratinization, and, thus, reducing, the, likelihood, of, skin, problems, producing, malodours, poor, quality, proteins, also, have, a, role, regarding, gastrointestinal, health, increasing, the, potential, for, flatulence, and, odorous, compounds, in, dogs, because, when, proteins, reach, the, colon, in, an, undigested, state, they, are, fermented, producing, hydrogen, sulfide, gas, indole, and, skatole, dogs, and, cats, digest, animal, proteins, better, than, those, from, plants, but, products, of, low, quality, animal, origin, are, poorly, digested, including, skin, feathers, and, connective, tissue, the, mechanical, properties, of, proteins, are, highly, diverse, and, are, often, central, to, their, biological, function, as, in, the, case, of, proteins, like, keratin, and, collagen, for, instance, the, ability, of, muscle, tissue, to, continually, expand, and, contract, is, directly, tied, to, the, elastic, properties, of, their, underlying, protein, makeup, beyond, fibrous, proteins, the, conformational, dynamics, of, enzymes, and, the, structure, of, biological, membranes, among, other, biological, functions, are, governed, by, the, mechanical, properties, of, the, proteins, outside, of, their, biological, context, the, unique, mechanical, properties, of, many, proteins, along, with, their, relative, sustainability, when, compared, to, synthetic, polymers, have, made, them, desirable, targets, for, next, generation, materials, design, young, s, modulus, e, is, calculated, as, the, axial, stress, over, the, resulting, strain, it, is, a, measure, of, the, relative, stiffness, of, a, material, in, the, context, of, proteins, this, stiffness, often, directly, correlates, to, biological, function, for, example, collagen, found, in, connective, tissue, bones, and, cartilage, and, keratin, found, in, nails, claws, and, hair, have, observed, stiffnesses, that, are, several, orders, of, magnitude, higher, than, that, of, elastin, which, is, though, to, give, elasticity, to, structures, such, as, blood, vessels, pulmonary, tissue, and, bladder, tissue, among, others, in, comparison, to, this, globular, proteins, such, as, bovine, serum, albumin, which, float, relatively, freely, in, the, cytosol, and, often, function, as, enzymes, and, thus, undergoing, frequent, conformational, changes, have, comparably, much, lower, young, s, moduli, the, young, s, modulus, of, a, single, protein, can, be, found, through, molecular, dynamics, simulation, using, either, atomistic, force, fields, such, as, charmm, or, gromos, or, coarse, grained, forcefields, like, martini, a, single, protein, molecule, can, be, stretched, by, a, uniaxial, force, while, the, resulting, extension, is, recorded, in, order, to, calculate, the, strain, experimentally, methods, such, as, atomic, force, microscopy, can, be, used, to, obtain, similar, data, at, the, macroscopic, level, the, young, s, modulus, of, cross, linked, protein, networks, can, be, obtained, through, more, traditional, mechanical, testing, experimentally, observed, values, for, a, few, proteins, can, be, seen, below, in, addition, to, serving, as, enzymes, within, the, cell, globular, proteins, often, act, as, key, transport, molecules, for, instance, serum, albumins, a, key, component, of, blood, are, necessary, for, the, transport, of, a, multitude, of, small, molecules, throughout, the, body, because, of, this, the, concentration, dependent, behavior, of, these, proteins, in, solution, is, directly, tied, to, the, function, of, the, circulatory, system, on, way, of, quantifying, this, behavior, is, through, the, viscosity, of, the, solution, viscosity, is, generally, given, is, a, measure, of, a, fluid, s, resistance, to, deformation, it, can, be, calculated, as, the, ratio, between, the, applied, stress, and, the, rate, of, change, of, the, resulting, shear, strain, that, is, the, rate, of, deformation, viscosity, of, complex, liquid, mixtures, such, as, blood, often, depends, strongly, on, temperature, and, solute, concentration, for, serum, albumin, specifically, bovine, serum, albumin, the, following, relation, between, viscosity, and, temperature, and, concentration, can, be, used, exp, c, c, b, d, t, e, r, t, displaystyle, eta, exp, left, where, c, is, the, concentration, t, is, the, temperature, r, is, the, gas, constant, and, b, d, and, e, are, all, material, based, property, constants, this, equation, has, the, form, of, an, arrhenius, equation, assigning, viscosity, an, exponential, dependence, on, temperature, and, concentration
