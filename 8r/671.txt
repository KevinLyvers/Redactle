7, 10, see, text, the, european, robin, erithacus, rubecula, known, simply, as, the, robin, or, robin, redbreast, in, the, british, isles, is, a, small, insectivorous, passerine, bird, that, belongs, to, the, chat, subfamily, of, the, old, world, flycatcher, family, it, is, found, across, europe, east, to, western, siberia, and, south, to, north, africa, it, is, sedentary, in, most, of, its, range, except, the, far, north, it, is, about, 12, 5, 14, 0, cm, 4, 9, 5, 5, in, in, length, the, male, and, female, are, similar, in, colouration, with, an, orange, breast, and, face, lined, with, grey, brown, upper, parts, and, a, whitish, belly, the, distinctive, orange, breast, of, both, sexes, contributed, to, the, european, robin, s, original, name, of, redbreast, orange, as, a, colour, name, being, unknown, in, english, until, the, 16th, century, by, which, time, the, fruit, of, the, same, name, had, been, introduced, the, dutch, roodborstje, french, rouge, gorge, swedish, r, dhake, german, rotkehlchen, italian, pettirosso, spanish, petirrojo, and, portuguese, pisco, de, peito, ruivo, all, refer, to, the, distinctively, coloured, front, in, the, 15th, century, when, it, became, popular, to, give, human, names, to, familiar, species, the, bird, came, to, be, known, as, robin, redbreast, which, was, eventually, shortened, to, robin, as, a, given, name, robin, is, originally, a, smaller, form, of, the, name, robert, the, term, robin, is, also, applied, to, some, birds, in, other, families, with, red, or, orange, breasts, these, include, the, american, robin, turdus, migratorius, a, thrush, and, the, australasian, robins, of, the, family, petroicidae, the, relationships, of, which, are, unclear, other, older, english, names, for, the, bird, include, ruddock, and, robinet, in, american, literature, of, the, late, 19th, century, this, robin, was, frequently, called, the, english, robin, the, european, robin, was, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, in, the, 10th, edition, of, his, systema, naturae, under, the, binomial, name, motacilla, rubecula, its, specific, epithet, rubecula, is, a, diminutive, derived, from, the, latin, ruber, meaning, red, the, genus, erithacus, was, introduced, by, french, naturalist, georges, cuvier, in, 1800, giving, the, bird, its, current, binomial, name, e, rubecula, the, genus, name, erithacus, is, from, ancient, greek, and, refers, to, an, unknown, bird, now, usually, identified, as, robin, the, genus, erithacus, previously, included, the, japanese, robin, and, the, ryukyu, robin, these, east, asian, species, were, shown, in, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, to, be, more, similar, to, a, group, of, other, asian, species, than, to, the, european, robin, in, a, reorganisation, of, the, genera, the, japanese, and, the, ryukyu, robins, were, moved, to, the, resurrected, genus, larvivora, leaving, the, european, robin, as, the, sole, member, of, erithacus, the, phylogenetic, analysis, placed, erithacus, in, the, subfamily, erithacinae, which, otherwise, contained, only, african, species, but, its, exact, position, with, respect, to, the, other, genera, was, not, resolved, the, genus, erithacus, was, formerly, classified, as, a, member, of, the, thrush, family, turdidae, but, is, now, considered, to, belong, to, the, old, world, flycatcher, family, muscicapidae, specifically, to, the, chats, subfamily, saxicolinae, which, also, include, the, common, nightingale, in, their, large, continental, eurasian, range, robins, vary, somewhat, but, do, not, form, discrete, populations, that, might, be, considered, subspecies, robin, subspecies, are, mainly, distinguished, by, forming, resident, populations, on, islands, and, in, mountainous, areas, the, robin, found, in, the, british, isles, and, much, of, western, europe, erithacus, rubecula, melophilus, occurs, as, a, vagrant, in, adjacent, regions, e, r, witherbyi, from, northwest, africa, corsica, and, sardinia, closely, resembles, melophilus, but, has, shorter, wings, the, northeasternmost, birds, large, and, fairly, washed, out, in, colour, are, e, r, tataricus, in, the, southeast, of, its, range, e, r, valens, of, the, crimean, peninsula, e, r, caucasicus, of, the, caucasus, and, northern, transcaucasia, and, e, r, hyrcanus, southeastwards, into, iran, are, generally, accepted, as, significantly, distinct, on, madeira, and, the, azores, the, local, population, has, been, described, as, e, r, microrhynchos, and, although, not, distinct, in, morphology, its, isolation, seems, to, suggest, the, subspecies, is, valid, but, see, below, the, most, distinct, birds, are, those, of, gran, canaria, e, r, marionae, and, tenerife, e, r, superbus, which, may, be, considered, two, distinct, species, or, at, least, two, different, subspecies, they, are, readily, distinguished, by, a, white, eye, ring, an, intensely, coloured, breast, a, grey, line, that, separates, the, orange, red, from, the, brown, colouration, and, the, belly, is, entirely, white, cytochrome, b, sequence, data, and, vocalisations, indicate, that, the, gran, canaria, tenerife, robins, are, indeed, very, distinct, and, probably, derived, from, colonisation, by, mainland, birds, some, 2, million, years, ago, christian, dietzen, hans, hinrich, witt, and, michael, wink, published, in, 2003, in, avian, science, a, study, called, the, phylogeographic, differentiation, of, the, european, robin, erithacus, rubecula, on, the, canary, islands, revealed, by, mitochondrial, dna, sequence, data, and, morphometrics, evidence, for, a, new, robin, taxon, on, gran, canaria, in, it, they, concluded, that, gran, canaria, s, robin, diverged, genetically, from, their, european, relatives, as, far, back, as, 2, 3, million, years, while, the, tenerife, ones, took, another, half, a, million, years, to, make, this, leap, 1, 8, million, years, ago, the, most, likely, reason, would, be, a, different, colonisation, of, the, canaries, by, this, bird, which, arrived, at, the, oldest, island, first, gran, canaria, and, subsequently, passed, to, the, neighbouring, island, tenerife, a, thorough, comparison, between, marionae, and, superbus, is, pending, to, confirm, that, the, first, one, is, effectively, a, different, subspecies, initial, results, suggest, that, birds, from, gran, canaria, have, wings, about, 10, shorter, than, those, on, tenerife, the, west, canary, islands, populations, are, younger, middle, pleistocene, and, only, beginning, to, diverge, genetically, robins, from, the, western, canary, islands, el, hierro, la, palma, and, la, gomera, e, r, microrhynchus, are, similar, to, the, european, type, subspecies, e, r, rubecula, finally, the, robins, which, can, be, found, in, fuerteventura, are, the, european, ones, which, is, not, surprising, as, the, species, does, not, breed, either, in, this, island, or, in, the, nearby, lanzarote, they, are, wintering, birds, or, just, passing, through, during, their, long, migration, between, africa, and, europe, the, larger, american, robin, turdus, migratorius, is, a, much, larger, bird, named, for, its, similar, coloration, to, the, european, robin, but, the, two, birds, are, not, closely, related, with, the, american, robin, instead, belonging, to, the, same, genus, as, the, common, blackbird, t, merula, a, species, which, occupies, much, of, the, same, range, as, the, european, robin, the, similarity, between, the, european, and, american, robins, lies, largely, in, the, orange, chest, patch, found, in, both, species, this, american, species, was, incorrectly, shown, feathering, its, nest, in, london, in, the, film, mary, poppins, but, it, only, occurs, in, the, uk, as, a, very, rare, vagrant, some, south, and, central, american, turdus, thrushes, are, also, called, robins, such, as, the, rufous, collared, thrush, the, australian, robin, redbreast, more, correctly, the, scarlet, robin, petroica, multicolor, is, more, closely, related, to, crows, and, jays, than, it, is, to, the, european, robin, it, belongs, to, the, family, petroicidae, whose, members, are, commonly, called, australasian, robins, the, red, billed, leiothrix, leiothrix, lutea, is, sometimes, named, the, pekin, robin, by, aviculturalists, another, group, of, old, world, flycatchers, this, time, from, africa, and, asia, is, the, genus, copsychus, its, members, are, known, as, magpie, robins, one, of, which, the, oriental, magpie, robin, c, saularis, is, the, national, bird, of, bangladesh, the, adult, european, robin, is, 12, 5, 14, 0, cm, 4, 9, 5, 5, in, long, and, weighs, 16, 22, g, 0, 56, 0, 78, oz, with, a, wingspan, of, 20, 22, cm, 8, 8, 5, in, the, male, and, female, bear, similar, plumage, an, orange, breast, and, face, more, strongly, coloured, in, the, otherwise, similar, british, subspecies, e, r, melophilus, lined, by, a, bluish, grey, on, the, sides, of, the, neck, and, chest, the, upperparts, are, brownish, or, olive, tinged, in, british, birds, and, the, belly, whitish, while, the, legs, and, feet, are, brown, the, bill, and, eyes, are, black, juveniles, are, a, spotted, brown, and, white, in, colouration, with, patches, of, orange, gradually, appearing, the, robin, occurs, in, eurasia, east, to, western, siberia, south, to, algeria, and, on, the, atlantic, islands, as, far, west, as, the, central, group, of, the, azores, and, madeira, it, is, a, vagrant, in, iceland, in, the, southeast, it, reaches, iran, the, caucasus, range, irish, and, british, robins, are, largely, resident, but, a, small, minority, usually, female, migrate, to, southern, europe, during, winter, a, few, as, far, as, spain, scandinavian, and, russian, robins, migrate, to, britain, and, western, europe, to, escape, the, harsher, winters, these, migrants, can, be, recognised, by, the, greyer, tone, of, the, upper, parts, of, their, bodies, and, duller, orange, breast, the, continental, european, robins, that, migrate, during, winter, prefer, spruce, woods, in, northern, europe, contrasting, with, its, preference, for, parks, and, gardens, in, great, britain, in, southern, iberia, habitat, segregation, of, resident, and, migrant, robins, occurs, with, resident, robins, remaining, in, the, same, woodlands, where, they, bred, attempts, to, introduce, the, european, robin, into, australia, and, new, zealand, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 19th, century, were, unsuccessful, birds, were, released, around, melbourne, auckland, christchurch, wellington, and, dunedin, by, various, local, acclimatisation, societies, with, none, becoming, established, there, was, a, similar, outcome, in, north, america, as, birds, failed, to, become, established, after, being, released, in, long, island, new, york, in, 1852, oregon, in, 1889, 1892, and, the, saanich, peninsula, in, british, columbia, in, 1908, 1910, the, robin, is, diurnal, although, it, has, been, reported, to, be, active, hunting, insects, on, moonlit, nights, or, near, artificial, light, at, night, well, known, to, british, and, irish, gardeners, it, is, relatively, unafraid, of, people, and, drawn, to, human, activities, involving, the, digging, of, soil, in, order, to, look, out, for, earthworms, and, other, food, freshly, turned, up, the, robin, is, considered, to, be, a, gardener, s, friend, and, from, the, traditional, association, of, the, red, breast, with, the, blood, of, christ, the, robin, would, never, be, harmed, in, continental, europe, on, the, other, hand, robins, were, hunted, and, killed, as, were, most, other, small, birds, and, are, therefore, more, wary, robins, also, approach, large, wild, animals, such, as, wild, boar, which, disturb, the, ground, to, look, for, any, food, that, might, be, brought, to, the, surface, in, autumn, and, winter, robins, will, supplement, their, usual, diet, of, terrestrial, invertebrates, such, as, spiders, worms, and, insects, with, berries, and, fruit, they, will, also, eat, seed, mixtures, and, suet, placed, on, bird, tables, male, robins, are, noted, for, their, highly, aggressive, territorial, behaviour, they, will, fiercely, attack, other, males, and, competitors, that, stray, into, their, territories, and, have, been, observed, attacking, other, small, birds, without, apparent, provocation, there, are, instances, of, robins, attacking, their, own, reflection, territorial, disputes, sometimes, lead, to, fatalities, accounting, for, up, to, 10, of, adult, robin, deaths, in, some, areas, because, of, high, mortality, in, the, first, year, of, life, a, robin, has, an, average, life, expectancy, of, 1, 1, years, however, once, past, its, first, year, life, expectancy, increases, one, robin, has, been, recorded, as, reaching, 19, years, of, age, a, spell, of, very, low, temperatures, in, winter, can, however, result, in, higher, mortality, rates, the, species, is, parasitised, by, the, moorhen, flea, dasypsyllus, gallinulae, and, the, acanthocephalan, apororhynchus, silesiacus, robins, may, choose, a, wide, variety, of, sites, for, building, a, nest, in, fact, anything, which, can, offer, some, shelter, like, a, depression, or, hole, may, be, considered, as, well, as, the, usual, crevices, or, sheltered, banks, other, objects, include, pieces, of, machinery, barbecues, bicycle, handlebars, bristles, on, upturned, brooms, discarded, kettles, watering, cans, flower, pots, and, hats, robins, will, also, nest, in, manmade, nest, boxes, favouring, a, design, with, an, open, front, placed, in, a, sheltered, position, up, to, 2, metres, 6, ft, 7, in, from, the, ground, nests, are, generally, composed, of, moss, leaves, and, grass, with, fine, grass, hair, and, feathers, for, lining, two, or, three, clutches, of, five, or, six, eggs, are, laid, throughout, the, breeding, season, which, commences, in, march, in, britain, and, ireland, the, eggs, are, a, cream, buff, or, white, speckled, or, blotched, with, reddish, brown, colour, often, more, heavily, so, at, the, larger, end, when, juvenile, birds, fly, from, the, nests, their, colouration, is, entirely, mottled, brown, after, two, to, three, months, out, of, the, nest, the, juvenile, bird, grows, some, orange, feathers, under, its, chin, and, over, a, similar, period, this, patch, gradually, extends, to, complete, the, adult, appearance, of, an, entirely, red, orange, breast, the, robin, produces, a, fluting, warbling, song, during, the, breeding, season, both, the, male, and, female, sing, throughout, the, year, including, during, the, winter, when, they, hold, separate, territories, during, the, winter, the, robin, s, song, is, more, plaintive, than, the, summer, version, the, female, robin, moves, a, short, distance, from, the, summer, nesting, territory, to, a, nearby, area, that, is, more, suitable, for, winter, feeding, the, male, robin, keeps, the, same, territory, throughout, the, year, during, the, breeding, season, male, robins, usually, initiate, their, morning, song, an, hour, before, civil, sunrise, and, usually, terminate, their, daily, singing, around, thirty, minutes, after, sunset, nocturnal, singing, can, also, occur, especially, in, urban, areas, that, are, artificially, lit, during, the, night, some, urban, robins, opt, to, sing, at, night, to, avoid, daytime, anthropogenic, noise, the, avian, magnetic, compass, of, the, robin, has, been, extensively, researched, and, uses, vision, based, magnetoreception, in, which, the, robin, s, ability, to, sense, the, magnetic, field, of, the, earth, for, navigation, is, affected, by, the, light, entering, the, bird, s, eye, the, physical, mechanism, of, the, robin, s, magnetic, sense, involves, quantum, entanglement, of, electron, spins, in, cryptochrome, in, the, bird, s, eyes, the, european, robin, has, an, extensive, range, and, a, population, numbering, in, the, hundreds, of, millions, the, species, does, not, approach, the, vulnerable, thresholds, under, the, population, trend, criterion, 30, per, cent, decline, over, ten, years, or, three, generations, the, population, appears, to, be, increasing, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, evaluates, it, as, least, concern, the, robin, features, prominently, in, british, folklore, and, that, of, northwestern, france, but, much, less, so, in, other, parts, of, europe, though, in, the, nineteenth, century, jacob, grimm, reported, a, tradition, from, german, speaking, europe, that, if, someone, disturbed, a, robin, s, nest, their, house, would, be, struck, by, lightning, 682, 83, robins, feature, in, the, traditional, children, s, tale, babes, in, the, wood, the, birds, cover, the, dead, bodies, of, the, children, the, robin, has, become, strongly, associated, with, christmas, taking, a, starring, role, on, many, christmas, cards, since, the, mid, 19th, century, the, robin, has, appeared, on, many, christmas, postage, stamps, an, old, british, folk, tale, seeks, to, explain, the, robin, s, distinctive, breast, legend, has, it, that, when, jesus, was, dying, on, the, cross, the, robin, then, simply, brown, in, colour, flew, to, his, side, and, sang, into, his, ear, in, order, to, comfort, him, in, his, pain, the, blood, from, his, wounds, stained, the, robin, s, breast, and, thereafter, all, robins, carry, the, mark, of, christ, s, blood, upon, them, an, alternative, legend, has, it, that, its, breast, was, scorched, fetching, water, for, souls, in, purgatory, the, association, with, christmas, more, probably, arises, from, the, fact, that, postmen, in, victorian, britain, wore, red, jackets, and, were, nicknamed, robins, the, robin, featured, on, the, christmas, card, is, an, emblem, of, the, postman, delivering, the, card, in, the, 1960s, in, a, vote, publicised, by, the, times, the, robin, was, adopted, as, the, unofficial, national, bird, of, the, united, kingdom, in, 2015, the, robin, was, again, voted, britain, s, national, bird, in, a, poll, organised, by, birdwatcher, david, lindo, taking, 34, of, the, final, vote, several, english, and, welsh, sports, organisations, are, nicknamed, the, robins, the, nickname, is, typically, used, for, teams, whose, home, colours, predominantly, use, red, these, include, the, professional, football, clubs, bristol, city, crewe, alexandra, swindon, town, cheltenham, town, and, traditionally, wrexham, a, f, c, as, well, as, the, english, rugby, league, team, the, hull, kingston, rovers, whose, home, colours, are, white, with, a, red, band, as, of, 2019, bristol, city, swindon, town, and, cheltenham, town, also, incorporate, a, robin, image, in, their, current, badge, designs, a, small, bird, is, an, unusual, choice, although, it, is, thought, to, symbolise, agility, in, darting, around, the, field
