sloths, are, a, neotropical, group, of, xenarthran, mammals, constituting, the, suborder, folivora, including, the, extant, arboreal, tree, sloths, and, extinct, terrestrial, ground, sloths, noted, for, their, slowness, of, movement, tree, sloths, spend, most, of, their, lives, hanging, upside, down, in, the, trees, of, the, tropical, rainforests, of, south, america, and, central, america, sloths, are, considered, to, be, most, closely, related, to, anteaters, together, making, up, the, xenarthran, order, pilosa, there, are, six, extant, sloth, species, in, two, genera, bradypus, three, toed, sloths, and, choloepus, two, toed, sloths, despite, this, traditional, naming, all, sloths, have, three, toes, on, each, rear, limb, although, two, toed, sloths, have, only, two, digits, on, each, forelimb, the, two, groups, of, sloths, are, from, different, distantly, related, families, and, are, thought, to, have, evolved, their, morphology, via, parallel, evolution, from, terrestrial, ancestors, besides, the, extant, species, many, species, of, ground, sloths, ranging, up, to, the, size, of, elephants, like, megatherium, inhabited, both, north, and, south, america, during, the, pleistocene, epoch, however, they, became, extinct, during, the, quaternary, extinction, event, around, 12, 000, years, ago, along, with, most, large, animals, across, the, americas, the, extinction, correlates, in, time, with, the, arrival, of, humans, but, climate, change, has, also, been, suggested, to, have, contributed, members, of, an, endemic, radiation, of, caribbean, sloths, also, formerly, lived, in, the, greater, antilles, but, became, extinct, after, humans, settled, the, archipelago, in, the, mid, holocene, around, 6, 000, years, ago, sloths, are, so, named, because, of, their, very, low, metabolism, and, deliberate, movements, sloth, related, to, slow, literally, means, laziness, and, their, common, names, in, several, other, languages, e, g, german, faultier, french, paresseux, spanish, perezoso, romanian, lene, finnish, laiskiainen, also, mean, lazy, or, similar, their, slowness, permits, their, low, energy, diet, of, leaves, and, avoids, detection, by, predatory, hawks, and, cats, that, hunt, by, sight, sloths, are, almost, helpless, on, the, ground, but, are, able, to, swim, the, shaggy, coat, has, grooved, hair, that, is, host, to, symbiotic, green, algae, which, camouflage, the, animal, in, the, trees, and, provide, it, nutrients, the, algae, also, nourish, sloth, moths, some, species, of, which, exist, solely, on, sloths, sloths, belong, to, the, superorder, xenarthra, a, group, of, placental, mammals, believed, to, have, evolved, in, the, continent, of, south, america, around, 60, million, years, ago, one, study, found, that, xenarthrans, broke, off, from, other, placental, mammals, around, 100, million, years, ago, anteaters, and, armadillos, are, also, included, among, xenarthra, the, earliest, xenarthrans, were, arboreal, herbivores, with, sturdy, vertebral, columns, fused, pelvises, stubby, teeth, and, small, brains, sloths, are, in, the, taxonomic, suborder, folivora, of, the, order, pilosa, these, names, are, from, the, latin, leaf, eater, and, hairy, respectively, pilosa, is, one, of, the, smallest, of, the, orders, of, the, mammal, class, its, only, other, suborder, contains, the, anteaters, the, folivora, are, divided, into, at, least, eight, families, only, two, of, which, have, living, species, the, remainder, are, entirely, extinct, the, common, ancestor, of, the, two, existing, sloth, genera, dates, to, about, 28, million, years, ago, with, similarities, between, the, two, and, three, toed, sloths, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, to, an, arboreal, lifestyle, one, of, the, most, striking, examples, of, convergent, evolution, known, among, mammals, the, ancient, xenarthra, included, a, significantly, greater, variety, of, species, with, a, wider, distribution, than, those, of, today, ancient, sloths, were, mostly, terrestrial, and, some, reached, sizes, that, rival, those, of, elephants, as, was, the, case, for, megatherium, sloths, arose, in, south, america, during, a, long, period, of, isolation, and, eventually, spread, to, a, number, of, the, caribbean, islands, as, well, as, north, america, it, is, thought, that, swimming, led, to, oceanic, dispersal, of, pilosans, to, the, greater, antilles, by, the, oligocene, and, that, the, megalonychid, pliometanastes, and, the, mylodontid, thinobadistes, were, able, to, colonise, north, america, about, 9, million, years, ago, well, before, the, formation, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, the, latter, development, about, 3, million, years, ago, allowed, megatheriids, and, nothrotheriids, to, also, invade, north, america, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, additionally, the, nothrotheriid, thalassocnus, of, the, west, coast, of, south, america, became, adapted, to, a, semiaquatic, and, eventually, perhaps, fully, aquatic, marine, lifestyle, in, peru, and, chile, thalassocnus, entered, the, coastal, habitat, beginning, in, the, late, miocene, they, presumably, waded, and, paddled, in, the, water, for, short, period, but, over, a, span, of, 4, million, years, they, eventually, evolved, into, swimming, creatures, becoming, specialist, bottom, feeders, of, seagrasses, similar, to, the, extant, sirenians, both, types, of, extant, tree, sloth, tend, to, occupy, the, same, forests, in, most, areas, a, particular, species, of, the, somewhat, smaller, and, generally, slower, moving, three, toed, sloth, bradypus, and, a, single, species, of, the, two, toed, type, will, jointly, predominate, based, on, morphological, comparisons, it, was, thought, the, two, toed, sloths, nested, phylogenetically, within, one, of, the, divisions, of, the, extinct, greater, antilles, sloths, though, data, has, been, collected, on, over, 33, different, species, of, sloths, by, analyzing, bone, structures, many, of, the, relationships, between, clades, on, a, phylogenetic, tree, were, unclear, much, of, the, morphological, evidence, collected, to, support, the, hypothesis, of, diphyly, has, been, based, on, the, structure, of, the, inner, ear, recently, obtained, molecular, data, from, collagen, and, mitochondrial, dna, sequences, fall, in, line, with, the, diphyly, convergent, evolution, hypothesis, but, have, overturned, some, of, the, other, conclusions, obtained, from, morphology, these, investigations, consistently, place, two, toed, sloths, close, to, mylodontids, and, three, toed, sloths, within, megatherioidea, close, to, megalonyx, megatheriids, and, nothrotheriids, they, make, the, previously, recognized, family, megalonychidae, polyphyletic, with, both, two, toed, sloths, and, greater, antilles, sloths, being, moved, away, from, megalonyx, greater, antilles, sloths, are, now, placed, in, a, separate, basal, branch, of, the, sloth, evolutionary, tree, the, following, sloth, family, phylogenetic, tree, is, based, on, collagen, and, mitochondrial, dna, sequence, data, megalocnidae, greater, antilles, sloths, scelidotheriidae, mylodontidae, choloepodidae, two, toed, sloths, megalonychidae, bradypodidae, three, toed, sloths, nothrotheriidae, megatheriidae, the, marine, sloths, of, south, america, s, pacific, coast, became, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, pliocene, following, the, closing, of, the, central, american, seaway, the, closing, caused, a, cooling, trend, in, the, coastal, waters, which, killed, off, much, of, the, area, s, seagrass, and, which, would, have, also, made, thermoregulation, difficult, for, the, sloths, with, their, slow, metabolism, ground, sloths, disappeared, from, both, north, and, south, america, shortly, after, the, appearance, of, humans, about, 11, 000, years, ago, evidence, suggests, human, hunting, contributed, to, the, extinction, of, the, american, megafauna, ground, sloth, remains, found, in, both, north, and, south, america, indicate, that, they, were, killed, cooked, and, eaten, by, humans, climate, change, that, came, with, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, may, have, also, played, a, role, although, previous, similar, glacial, retreats, were, not, associated, with, similar, extinction, rates, megalocnus, and, some, other, caribbean, sloths, survived, until, about, 5, 000, years, ago, long, after, ground, sloths, had, died, out, on, the, mainland, but, then, went, extinct, when, humans, finally, colonized, the, greater, antilles, sloths, can, be, 60, to, 80, cm, 24, to, 31, in, long, and, depending, on, the, species, weigh, from, 3, 6, to, 7, 7, kg, 7, 9, to, 17, 0, lb, two, toed, sloths, are, slightly, larger, than, three, toed, sloths, sloths, have, long, limbs, and, rounded, heads, with, tiny, ears, three, toed, sloths, also, have, stubby, tails, about, 5, to, 6, cm, 2, 0, to, 2, 4, in, long, sloths, are, unusual, among, mammals, in, not, having, seven, cervical, vertebrae, two, toed, sloths, have, five, to, seven, while, three, toed, sloths, have, eight, or, nine, the, other, mammals, not, having, seven, are, the, manatees, with, six, sloths, have, colour, vision, but, have, poor, visual, acuity, they, also, have, poor, hearing, thus, they, rely, on, their, sense, of, smell, and, touch, to, find, food, sloths, have, very, low, metabolic, rates, less, than, half, of, that, expected, for, a, mammal, of, their, size, and, low, body, temperatures, 30, to, 34, c, 86, to, 93, f, when, active, and, still, lower, when, resting, sloths, are, heterothermic, meaning, their, body, temperature, may, vary, according, to, the, environment, normally, ranging, from, 25, to, 35, c, 77, to, 95, f, but, able, to, drop, to, as, low, as, 20, c, 68, f, inducing, torpor, the, outer, hairs, of, sloth, fur, grow, in, a, direction, opposite, from, that, of, other, mammals, in, most, mammals, hairs, grow, toward, the, extremities, but, because, sloths, spend, so, much, time, with, their, limbs, above, their, bodies, their, hairs, grow, away, from, the, extremities, to, provide, protection, from, the, elements, while, they, hang, upside, down, in, most, conditions, the, fur, hosts, symbiotic, algae, which, provide, camouflage, from, predatory, jaguars, ocelots, and, harpy, eagles, because, of, the, algae, sloth, fur, is, a, small, ecosystem, of, its, own, hosting, many, species, of, commensal, and, parasitic, arthropods, there, are, a, large, number, of, arthropods, associated, with, sloths, these, include, biting, and, blood, sucking, flies, such, as, mosquitoes, and, sandflies, triatomine, bugs, lice, ticks, and, mites, sloths, have, a, highly, specific, community, of, commensal, beetles, mites, and, moths, the, species, of, sloths, recorded, to, host, arthropods, include, the, pale, throated, three, toed, sloth, the, brown, throated, three, toed, sloth, and, linnaeus, s, two, toed, sloth, sloths, benefit, from, their, relationship, with, moths, because, the, moths, are, responsible, for, fertilizing, algae, on, the, sloth, which, provides, them, with, nutrients, their, limbs, are, adapted, for, hanging, and, grasping, not, for, supporting, their, weight, muscle, mass, makes, up, only, 25, to, 30, percent, of, their, total, body, weight, most, other, mammals, have, a, muscle, mass, that, makes, up, 40, to, 45, percent, of, their, total, body, weight, their, specialised, hands, and, feet, have, long, curved, claws, to, allow, them, to, hang, upside, down, from, branches, without, effort, and, are, used, to, drag, themselves, along, the, ground, since, they, cannot, walk, on, three, toed, sloths, the, arms, are, 50, percent, longer, than, the, legs, sloths, move, only, when, necessary, and, even, then, very, slowly, they, usually, move, at, an, average, speed, of, 4, m, 13, ft, per, minute, but, can, move, at, a, marginally, higher, speed, of, 4, 5, m, 15, ft, per, minute, if, they, are, in, immediate, danger, from, a, predator, while, they, sometimes, sit, on, top, of, branches, they, usually, eat, sleep, and, even, give, birth, hanging, from, branches, they, sometimes, remain, hanging, from, branches, even, after, death, on, the, ground, the, maximum, speed, of, sloths, is, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, per, minute, two, toed, sloths, are, generally, better, able, than, three, toed, sloths, to, disperse, between, clumps, of, trees, on, the, ground, sloths, are, surprisingly, strong, swimmers, and, can, reach, speeds, of, 13, 5, m, 44, ft, per, minute, they, use, their, long, arms, to, paddle, through, the, water, and, can, cross, rivers, and, swim, between, islands, sloths, can, reduce, their, already, slow, metabolism, even, further, and, slow, their, heart, rate, to, less, than, a, third, of, normal, allowing, them, to, hold, their, breath, underwater, for, up, to, 40, minutes, wild, brown, throated, three, toed, sloths, sleep, on, average, 9, 6, hours, a, day, two, toed, sloths, are, nocturnal, three, toed, sloths, are, mostly, nocturnal, but, can, be, active, in, the, day, they, spend, 90, per, cent, of, their, time, motionless, sloths, are, solitary, animals, that, rarely, interact, with, one, another, except, during, breeding, season, though, female, sloths, do, sometimes, congregate, more, so, than, do, males, sloths, descend, about, once, every, eight, days, to, defecate, on, the, ground, the, reason, and, mechanism, behind, this, behavior, have, long, been, debated, among, scientists, there, are, at, least, five, hypotheses, 1, fertilize, trees, when, feces, are, deposited, at, the, base, of, the, tree, 2, cover, feces, and, avoid, predation, 3, chemical, communication, between, individuals, 4, pick, up, trace, nutrients, in, their, claws, that, are, then, ingested, and, 5, favor, a, mutualistic, relationship, with, populations, of, fur, moths, more, recently, a, new, hypothesis, has, emerged, which, presents, evidence, against, the, previous, ones, and, proposes, that, all, current, sloths, are, descendants, from, species, that, defecated, on, the, ground, and, there, simply, has, not, been, enough, selective, pressure, to, abandon, this, behavior, since, cases, of, predation, during, defecation, are, actually, very, rare, baby, sloths, learn, what, to, eat, by, licking, the, lips, of, their, mother, all, sloths, eat, the, leaves, of, cecropia, two, toed, sloths, are, omnivorous, with, a, diverse, diet, of, insects, carrion, fruits, leaves, and, small, lizards, ranging, over, up, to, 140, hectares, 350, acres, three, toed, sloths, on, the, other, hand, are, almost, entirely, herbivorous, plant, eaters, with, a, limited, diet, of, leaves, from, only, a, few, trees, and, no, other, mammal, digests, its, food, as, slowly, they, have, made, adaptations, to, arboreal, browsing, leaves, their, main, food, source, provide, very, little, energy, or, nutrients, and, do, not, digest, easily, so, sloths, have, large, slow, acting, multi, chambered, stomachs, in, which, symbiotic, bacteria, break, down, the, tough, leaves, as, much, as, two, thirds, of, a, well, fed, sloth, s, body, weight, consists, of, the, contents, of, its, stomach, and, the, digestive, process, can, take, a, month, or, more, to, complete, three, toed, sloths, go, to, the, ground, to, urinate, and, defecate, about, once, a, week, digging, a, hole, and, covering, it, afterwards, they, go, to, the, same, spot, each, time, and, are, vulnerable, to, predation, while, doing, so, considering, the, large, energy, expenditure, and, dangers, involved, in, the, journey, to, the, ground, this, behaviour, has, been, described, as, a, mystery, recent, research, shows, that, moths, which, live, in, the, sloth, s, fur, lay, eggs, in, the, sloth, s, feces, when, they, hatch, the, larvae, feed, on, the, feces, and, when, mature, fly, up, onto, the, sloth, above, these, moths, may, have, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, sloths, as, they, live, in, the, fur, and, promote, growth, of, algae, which, the, sloths, eat, individual, sloths, tend, to, spend, the, bulk, of, their, time, feeding, on, a, single, modal, tree, by, burying, their, excreta, near, the, trunk, of, that, tree, they, may, also, help, nourish, it, the, pale, and, brown, throated, three, toed, sloths, mate, seasonally, while, the, maned, three, toed, sloth, breeds, at, any, time, of, the, year, the, reproduction, of, pygmy, three, toed, sloths, is, currently, unknown, litters, are, of, one, newborn, only, after, six, months, gestation, for, three, toed, and, 12, months, for, two, toed, newborns, stay, with, their, mother, for, about, five, months, in, some, cases, young, sloths, die, from, a, fall, indirectly, because, the, mothers, prove, unwilling, to, leave, the, safety, of, the, trees, to, retrieve, the, young, females, normally, bear, one, baby, every, year, but, sometimes, sloths, low, level, of, movement, actually, keeps, females, from, finding, males, for, longer, than, one, year, sloths, are, not, particularly, sexually, dimorphic, and, several, zoos, have, received, sloths, of, the, wrong, sex, the, average, lifespan, of, two, toed, sloths, in, the, wild, is, currently, unknown, due, to, a, lack, of, full, lifespan, studies, in, a, natural, environment, median, life, expectancy, in, human, care, is, about, 16, years, with, one, individual, at, the, smithsonian, institution, s, national, zoo, reaching, an, age, of, 49, years, before, her, death, although, habitat, is, limited, to, the, tropical, rainforests, of, central, and, south, america, in, that, environment, sloths, are, successful, on, barro, colorado, island, in, panama, sloths, have, been, estimated, to, constitute, 70, of, the, biomass, of, arboreal, mammals, four, of, the, six, living, species, are, currently, rated, least, concern, the, maned, three, toed, sloth, bradypus, torquatus, which, inhabits, brazil, s, dwindling, atlantic, forest, is, classified, as, vulnerable, while, the, island, dwelling, pygmy, three, toed, sloth, b, pygmaeus, is, critically, endangered, sloths, lower, metabolism, confines, them, to, the, tropics, and, they, adopt, thermoregulation, behaviors, of, cold, blooded, animals, such, as, sunning, themselves, the, majority, of, recorded, sloth, deaths, in, costa, rica, are, due, to, contact, with, electrical, lines, and, poachers, their, claws, also, provide, another, unexpected, deterrent, to, human, hunters, when, hanging, upside, down, in, a, tree, they, are, held, in, place, by, the, claws, themselves, and, often, do, not, fall, down, even, if, shot, from, below, sloths, are, victims, of, animal, trafficking, where, they, are, sold, as, pets, however, they, generally, make, very, poor, pets, as, they, have, such, a, specialized, ecology, the, sloth, institute, costa, rica, is, known, for, caring, rehabilitating, and, releasing, sloths, back, into, the, wild, also, in, costa, rica, the, aviarios, sloth, sanctuary, cares, for, sloths, it, has, rehabilitated, and, returned, about, 130, individuals, to, the, wild, however, a, report, in, may, 2016, featured, two, former, veterinarians, from, the, facility, who, were, critical, of, the, sanctuary, s, efforts, accusing, it, of, mistreating, the, animals
