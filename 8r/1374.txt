a, wound, is, any, disruption, of, or, damage, to, living, tissue, such, as, skin, mucous, membranes, or, organs, wounds, can, either, be, the, sudden, result, of, direct, trauma, mechanical, thermal, chemical, or, can, develop, slowly, over, time, due, to, underlying, disease, processes, such, as, diabetes, mellitus, venous, arterial, insufficiency, or, immunologic, disease, wounds, can, vary, greatly, in, their, appearance, depending, on, wound, location, injury, mechanism, depth, of, injury, timing, of, onset, acute, vs, chronic, and, wound, sterility, among, other, factors, treatment, strategies, for, wounds, will, vary, based, on, the, classification, of, the, wound, therefore, it, is, essential, that, wounds, be, thoroughly, evaluated, by, a, healthcare, professional, for, proper, management, in, normal, physiology, all, wounds, will, undergo, a, series, of, steps, collectively, known, as, the, wound, healing, process, which, include, hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and, tissue, remodeling, age, tissue, oxygenation, stress, underlying, medical, conditions, and, certain, medications, are, just, a, few, of, the, many, factors, known, to, affect, the, rate, of, wound, healing, wounds, can, be, broadly, classified, as, either, acute, or, chronic, based, on, time, from, initial, injury, and, progression, through, normal, stages, of, wound, healing, both, wound, types, can, further, be, categorized, by, cause, of, injury, wound, severity, depth, and, sterility, of, the, wound, bed, several, classification, systems, have, been, developed, to, describe, wounds, and, guide, their, management, some, notable, classification, systems, include, the, cdc, s, surgical, wound, classification, the, international, red, cross, wound, classification, the, tscherne, classification, the, gustilo, anderson, classification, of, open, fractures, and, the, ao, soft, tissue, grading, system, an, acute, wound, is, any, wound, which, results, from, direct, trauma, and, progresses, through, the, four, stages, of, wound, healing, along, an, expected, timeline, the, first, stage, hemostasis, lasts, from, minutes, to, hours, after, initial, injury, this, stage, is, followed, by, the, inflammatory, phase, which, typically, lasts, 1, to, 3, days, proliferation, is, the, third, stage, of, wound, healing, and, lasts, from, a, few, days, up, to, a, month, the, fourth, and, final, phase, of, wound, healing, remodeling, scar, formation, typically, lasts, 12, months, but, can, continue, as, long, as, 2, years, after, the, initial, injury, acute, wounds, can, further, be, classified, as, either, open, or, closed, an, open, wound, is, any, injury, whereby, the, integrity, of, the, skin, has, been, disrupted, and, the, underlying, tissue, is, exposed, a, closed, wound, on, the, other, hand, is, any, injury, in, which, underlying, tissue, has, been, damaged, but, the, overlying, skin, is, still, intact, fractures, can, be, classified, as, either, open, or, closed, depending, on, whether, the, integrity, of, the, overlying, skin, has, been, disrupted, or, preserved, respectively, several, classification, systems, have, been, developed, to, further, characterize, soft, tissue, injuries, in, the, setting, of, an, underlying, fracture, any, wound, which, is, arrested, or, delayed, during, any, of, the, normal, stages, of, wound, healing, is, considered, to, be, a, chronic, wound, most, commonly, these, are, wounds, which, develop, due, to, an, underlying, disease, process, such, as, diabetes, mellitus, or, arterial, venous, insufficiency, however, it, is, important, to, note, that, any, acute, wound, has, the, potential, to, become, a, chronic, wound, if, any, of, the, normal, stages, of, wound, healing, are, interrupted, chronic, wounds, are, most, commonly, a, result, of, disruption, of, the, inflammatory, phase, of, wound, healing, however, errors, in, any, phase, can, result, in, a, chronic, wound, the, exact, duration, of, time, which, distinguishes, a, chronic, wound, from, an, acute, wound, is, not, clearly, defined, although, many, clinicians, agree, that, wounds, which, have, not, progressed, for, over, three, months, are, considered, chronic, wounds, wound, sterility, or, degree, of, contamination, of, a, wound, is, a, critical, consideration, when, evaluating, a, wound, in, the, united, states, the, cdc, s, surgical, wound, classification, system, is, most, commonly, used, for, classification, of, a, wound, s, sterility, specifically, within, a, surgical, setting, according, to, this, classification, system, four, different, classes, of, wound, exist, each, with, their, own, postoperative, risk, of, surgical, site, infection, wound, presentation, will, vary, greatly, based, on, a, number, of, factors, each, of, which, is, important, to, consider, in, order, to, establish, a, proper, diagnosis, and, treatment, plan, in, addition, to, collecting, a, thorough, history, the, following, factors, should, be, considered, when, evaluating, any, wound, a, thorough, wound, evaluation, particularly, evaluation, of, wound, depth, and, removal, of, necrotic, tissue, should, be, performed, only, by, a, licensed, healthcare, professional, in, order, to, avoid, damage, to, nearby, structures, infection, or, worsening, pain, additional, diagnostic, tests, may, be, needed, during, wound, evaluation, based, on, the, cause, appearance, and, age, of, a, wound, the, goal, of, wound, care, is, to, promote, an, environment, that, allows, a, wound, to, heal, as, quickly, as, possible, with, emphasis, on, restoring, both, form, and, function, of, the, wounded, area, although, optimal, treatment, strategies, vary, greatly, depending, on, the, specific, cause, size, and, age, of, a, particular, wound, there, are, universal, principles, of, wound, management, that, apply, to, all, wounds, after, a, thorough, evaluation, is, performed, all, wounds, should, be, properly, irrigated, and, debrided, proper, cleansing, of, a, wound, is, critical, to, prevent, infection, and, promote, re, epithelialization, further, efforts, should, be, made, to, eliminate, limit, any, contributing, factors, to, the, wound, e, g, diabetes, pressure, etc, and, optimize, the, wound, s, healing, ability, i, e, optimize, nutritional, status, the, end, goal, of, wound, management, is, closure, of, the, wound, which, can, be, achieved, by, primary, closure, delayed, primary, closure, or, healing, by, secondary, intention, each, of, which, is, discussed, below, pain, control, is, a, mainstay, of, wound, management, as, wound, evaluation, wound, cleansing, and, dressing, changes, can, be, a, painful, process, proper, cleansing, of, a, wound, is, critical, in, preventing, infection, and, promoting, healing, of, any, wound, irrigation, is, defined, as, constant, flow, of, a, solution, over, the, surface, of, a, wound, the, goal, of, irrigation, is, not, only, to, remove, debris, and, potential, contaminants, from, a, wound, but, also, to, assist, in, visual, inspection, of, a, wound, and, hydrate, the, wound, irrigation, is, typically, achieved, with, either, a, bulb, or, syringe, and, needle, catheter, the, preferred, solution, for, irrigation, is, normal, saline, which, is, readily, accessible, in, the, emergency, department, although, recent, studies, have, shown, no, difference, in, emergency, department, infection, rates, when, comparing, normal, saline, to, potable, tap, water, irrigation, can, also, be, achieved, with, a, diluted, 1, povidone, iodine, solution, but, studies, have, again, shown, no, difference, in, infection, rates, when, compared, to, normal, saline, irrigation, with, antiseptic, solutions, such, as, non, diluted, povidone, iodine, chlorhexidine, and, hydrogen, peroxide, is, not, preferred, since, these, solutions, are, toxic, to, tissue, and, inhibit, wound, healing, the, exact, volume, of, irrigation, used, will, vary, depending, on, the, appearance, of, the, wound, although, some, sources, have, reported, 50, 100, ml, of, irrigation, per, 1, cm, of, wound, length, as, a, guideline, debridement, is, defined, as, removal, of, devitalized, or, dead, tissue, particularly, necrotic, tissue, eschar, or, slough, debridement, is, a, critical, aspect, of, wound, care, because, devitalized, tissue, particularly, necrotic, tissue, serves, as, nutrients, for, bacteria, thereby, promoting, infection, additionally, devitalized, tissue, creates, a, physical, barrier, over, a, wound, which, limits, the, effectiveness, of, any, applied, topical, compounds, and, prevents, re, epithelialization, lastly, devitalized, tissue, especially, eschar, prevents, accurate, assessment, of, underlying, tissue, making, appropriate, assessment, of, a, wound, impossible, without, adequate, debridement, debridement, can, be, achieved, in, several, ways, the, end, goal, of, wound, care, is, to, re, establish, the, integrity, of, the, skin, a, structure, which, serves, as, a, barrier, to, the, external, environment, the, preferred, method, of, closure, is, to, reattach, reapproximate, the, wound, edges, together, a, process, known, as, primary, closure, healing, by, primary, intention, wounds, that, have, not, been, closed, within, several, hours, of, the, initial, injury, or, wounds, that, are, concerning, for, infection, will, often, be, left, open, and, treated, with, dressings, for, several, days, before, being, closed, 3, 5, days, later, a, process, known, as, delayed, primary, closure, the, exact, duration, of, time, from, initial, injury, in, which, delayed, primary, closure, is, preferred, over, primary, closure, is, not, clearly, defined, wounds, that, cannot, be, closed, primarily, due, to, substantial, tissue, loss, can, be, healed, by, secondary, intention, a, process, in, which, the, wound, is, allowed, to, fill, in, over, time, through, natural, physiologic, processes, when, healing, by, secondary, intention, granulation, tissue, grows, in, from, the, wound, edges, slowly, over, time, to, restore, integrity, of, the, skin, healing, by, secondary, intention, can, take, up, to, months, requires, daily, wound, care, and, leaves, an, unfavorable, scar, thus, primary, closure, is, always, preferred, when, possible, as, an, alternative, wounds, that, cannot, be, closed, primarily, can, be, addressed, with, skin, grafting, or, flap, reconstruction, typically, done, by, a, plastic, surgeon, there, are, several, methods, that, can, be, implemented, to, achieve, primary, closure, of, a, wound, including, suture, staples, skin, adhesive, and, surgical, strips, suture, is, the, most, frequently, used, for, closure, there, are, many, types, of, suture, but, broadly, they, can, be, categorized, as, absorbable, vs, non, absorbable, and, synthetic, vs, natural, absorbable, sutures, have, the, added, benefit, of, not, requiring, removal, and, are, often, preferred, in, children, for, this, reason, staples, are, less, time, consuming, and, more, cost, effective, than, suture, but, have, a, risk, of, worse, scarring, if, left, in, place, for, too, long, adhesive, glue, and, sutures, have, comparable, cosmetic, outcomes, for, minor, lacerations, 5, cm, in, adults, and, children, the, use, of, adhesive, glue, involves, considerably, less, time, for, the, doctor, and, less, pain, for, the, person, the, wound, opens, at, a, slightly, higher, rate, but, there, is, less, redness, the, risk, for, infections, 1, 1, is, the, same, for, both, adhesive, glue, should, not, be, used, in, areas, of, high, tension, or, repetitive, movements, such, as, joints, or, the, posterior, trunk, after, a, wound, is, irrigated, debrided, and, if, possible, closed, it, should, be, dressed, appropriately, the, goals, of, a, wound, dressing, are, to, act, as, a, barrier, to, the, outside, environment, facilitate, wound, healing, promote, hemostasis, and, act, as, a, form, of, mechanical, debridement, during, dressing, changes, the, ideal, wound, dressing, maintains, a, moist, environment, to, optimize, wound, healing, but, is, also, capable, of, absorbing, excess, fluid, as, to, avoid, skin, maceration, or, bacterial, growth, several, wound, dressing, options, are, available, each, tailored, to, different, kinds, of, wounds, ideally, wound, dressings, should, be, changed, daily, to, promote, a, clean, environment, and, allow, for, daily, evaluation, of, wound, progression, highly, exudative, wounds, and, infected, wounds, should, be, monitored, closely, and, may, require, more, frequent, dressing, changes, negative, pressure, wound, dressings, can, be, changed, less, frequently, every, 2, 3, days, wound, progression, over, time, can, be, monitored, with, transparent, sheet, tracings, or, photographs, each, of, which, produce, reliable, measurements, of, wound, surface, area, there, is, moderate, evidence, that, honey, is, more, effective, than, antiseptic, followed, by, gauze, for, healing, wounds, infected, after, surgical, operations, there, is, a, lack, of, quality, evidence, relating, to, the, use, of, honey, on, other, types, of, wounds, such, as, minor, acute, wounds, mixed, acute, and, chronic, wounds, pressure, ulcers, fournier, s, gangrene, venous, leg, ulcers, diabetic, foot, ulcers, and, leishmaniasis, therapeutic, touch, has, been, implicated, as, a, complementary, therapy, in, wound, healing, however, there, is, no, high, quality, research, supporting, its, use, as, an, evidence, based, clinical, intervention, more, than, 400, species, of, plants, are, identified, as, potentially, useful, for, wound, healing, only, three, randomized, controlled, trials, however, have, been, done, for, the, treatment, of, burns, from, the, classical, period, to, the, medieval, period, the, body, and, the, soul, were, believed, to, be, intimately, connected, based, on, several, theories, put, forth, by, the, philosopher, plato, wounds, on, the, body, were, believed, to, correlate, with, wounds, to, the, soul, and, vice, versa, wounds, were, seen, as, an, outward, sign, of, an, inward, illness, thus, a, man, who, was, wounded, physically, in, a, serious, way, was, said, to, be, hindered, not, only, physically, but, spiritually, as, well, if, the, soul, was, wounded, that, wound, may, also, eventually, become, physically, manifest, revealing, the, true, state, of, the, soul, wounds, were, also, seen, as, writing, on, the, tablet, of, the, body, wounds, acquired, in, war, for, example, told, the, story, of, a, soldier, in, a, form, which, all, could, see, and, understand, and, the, wounds, of, a, martyr, told, the, story, of, their, faith, in, humans, and, mice, it, has, been, shown, that, estrogen, might, positively, affect, the, speed, and, quality, of, wound, healing
