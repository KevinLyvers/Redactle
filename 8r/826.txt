equidae, sometimes, known, as, the, horse, family, is, the, taxonomic, family, of, horses, and, related, animals, including, the, extant, horses, asses, and, zebras, and, many, other, species, known, only, from, fossils, the, family, evolved, around, 50, million, years, ago, from, a, small, multi, toed, ungulate, into, larger, single, toed, animals, all, extant, species, are, in, the, genus, equus, which, originated, in, north, america, equidae, belongs, to, the, order, perissodactyla, which, includes, the, extant, tapirs, and, rhinoceros, and, several, extinct, families, the, term, equid, refers, to, any, member, of, this, family, including, any, equine, the, oldest, known, fossils, assigned, to, equidae, were, found, in, north, america, and, date, from, the, early, eocene, epoch, 54, million, years, ago, they, were, once, assigned, to, the, genus, hyracotherium, but, the, type, species, of, that, genus, is, now, regarded, as, a, palaeothere, the, other, species, have, been, split, off, into, different, genera, these, early, equids, were, fox, sized, animals, with, three, toes, on, the, hind, feet, and, four, on, the, front, feet, they, were, herbivorous, browsers, on, relatively, soft, plants, and, already, adapted, for, running, the, complexity, of, their, brains, suggest, that, they, already, were, alert, and, intelligent, animals, later, species, reduced, the, number, of, toes, and, developed, teeth, more, suited, for, grinding, up, grasses, and, other, tough, plant, food, the, equids, like, other, perissodactyls, are, hindgut, fermenters, they, have, evolved, specialized, teeth, that, cut, and, shear, tough, plant, matter, to, accommodate, their, fibrous, diet, their, seemingly, inefficient, digestion, strategy, is, a, result, of, their, size, at, the, time, of, its, evolution, as, they, would, have, already, had, to, be, relatively, large, mammals, to, be, supported, on, such, a, strategy, the, family, became, relatively, diverse, during, the, miocene, epoch, with, many, new, species, appearing, by, this, time, equids, were, more, truly, horse, like, having, developed, the, typical, body, shape, of, the, modern, animals, many, of, these, species, bore, the, main, weight, of, their, bodies, on, their, central, third, toe, with, the, others, becoming, reduced, and, barely, touching, the, ground, if, at, all, the, sole, surviving, genus, equus, had, evolved, by, the, early, pleistocene, epoch, and, spread, rapidly, through, the, world
