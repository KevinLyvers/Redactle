see, text, convolvulaceae, k, n, v, l, v, j, l, e, s, i, i, a, commonly, called, the, bindweeds, or, morning, glories, is, a, family, of, about, 60, genera, and, more, than, 1, 650, species, these, species, are, primarily, herbaceous, vines, but, also, include, trees, shrubs, and, herbs, the, tubers, of, several, species, are, edible, the, best, known, of, which, is, the, sweet, potato, convolvulaceae, can, be, recognized, by, their, funnel, shaped, radially, symmetrical, corolla, the, floral, formula, for, the, family, has, five, sepals, five, fused, petals, five, epipetalous, stamens, stamens, fused, to, the, petals, and, a, two, part, syncarpous, and, superior, gynoecium, the, stems, of, these, plants, are, usually, winding, hence, their, latin, name, from, convolvere, to, wind, the, leaves, are, simple, and, alternate, without, stipules, in, parasitic, cuscuta, dodder, they, are, reduced, to, scales, the, fruit, can, be, a, capsule, berry, or, nut, all, containing, only, two, seeds, per, one, locule, one, ovule, ovary, the, leaves, and, starchy, tuberous, roots, of, some, species, are, used, as, foodstuffs, e, g, sweet, potato, and, water, spinach, and, the, seeds, are, exploited, for, their, medicinal, value, as, purgatives, some, species, contain, ergoline, alkaloids, that, are, likely, responsible, for, the, use, of, these, species, as, ingredients, in, psychedelic, drugs, e, g, ololiuhqui, the, presence, of, ergolines, in, some, species, of, this, family, is, due, to, infection, by, fungi, related, to, the, ergot, fungi, of, the, genus, claviceps, a, recent, study, of, convolvulaceae, species, ipomoea, asarifolia, and, its, associated, fungi, showed, the, presence, of, a, fungus, identified, by, dna, sequencing, of, 18s, and, its, ribosomal, dna, and, phylogenetic, analysis, to, be, closely, related, to, fungi, in, the, family, clavicipitaceae, was, always, associated, with, the, presence, of, ergoline, alkaloids, in, the, plant, the, identified, fungus, appears, to, be, a, seed, transmitted, obligate, biotroph, growing, epiphytically, on, its, host, this, finding, strongly, suggests, the, unique, presence, of, ergoline, alkaloids, in, some, species, of, the, family, convolvulaceae, is, due, to, symbiosis, with, clavicipitaceous, fungi, moreover, another, group, of, compounds, loline, alkaloids, commonly, produced, by, some, members, of, the, clavicipitaceous, fungi, genus, neotyphodium, has, been, identified, in, a, convolvulaceous, species, but, the, origin, of, the, loline, alkaloids, in, this, species, is, unknown, members, of, the, family, are, well, known, as, food, plants, e, g, sweet, potatoes, and, water, spinach, as, showy, garden, plants, e, g, morning, glory, and, as, troublesome, weeds, e, g, bindweed, mainly, convolvulus, and, calystegia, and, dodder, while, humbertia, madagascariensis, is, a, medium, sized, tree, and, ipomoea, carnea, is, an, erect, shrub, some, parasitic, members, of, this, family, are, also, used, medicinally
