see, text, grammistidae, bleeker, 1857, serranidae, is, a, large, family, of, fishes, belonging, to, the, order, perciformes, the, family, contains, about, 450, species, in, 65, genera, including, the, sea, basses, and, the, groupers, subfamily, epinephelinae, although, many, species, are, small, in, some, cases, less, than, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, the, giant, grouper, epinephelus, lanceolatus, is, one, of, the, largest, bony, fishes, in, the, world, growing, to, 2, 7, m, 8, ft, 10, in, in, length, and, 400, kg, 880, lb, in, weight, representatives, of, this, group, live, in, tropical, and, subtropical, seas, worldwide, many, serranid, species, are, brightly, colored, and, many, of, the, larger, species, are, caught, commercially, for, food, they, are, usually, found, over, reefs, in, tropical, to, subtropical, waters, along, the, coasts, serranids, are, generally, robust, in, form, with, large, mouths, and, small, spines, on, the, gill, coverings, they, typically, have, several, rows, of, sharp, teeth, usually, with, a, pair, of, particularly, large, canine, like, teeth, projecting, from, the, lower, jaw, all, serranids, are, carnivorous, although, some, species, especially, in, the, anthiadinae, subfamily, only, feed, on, zooplankton, the, majority, feed, on, fish, and, crustaceans, they, are, typically, ambush, predators, hiding, in, cover, on, the, reef, and, darting, out, to, grab, passing, prey, their, bright, colours, are, most, likely, a, form, of, disruptive, camouflage, similar, to, the, stripes, of, a, tiger, many, species, are, protogynous, hermaphrodites, meaning, they, start, out, as, females, and, change, sex, to, male, later, in, life, they, produce, large, quantities, of, eggs, and, their, larvae, are, planktonic, generally, at, the, mercy, of, ocean, currents, until, they, are, ready, to, settle, into, adult, populations, like, other, fish, serranids, harbour, parasites, including, nematodes, cestodes, digeneans, monogeneans, isopods, and, copepods, a, study, conducted, in, new, caledonia, has, shown, that, coral, reef, associated, serranids, harbour, about, 10, species, of, parasites, per, fish, species, in, recent, times, this, family, has, been, proposed, to, be, split, the, two, hypothetical, families, emerging, from, the, remains, of, the, possibly, obsolete, taxon, are, the, families, epinephilidae, and, anthiadidae, this, taxonomic, separation, is, recognized, by, some, authorities, including, the, iucn, recent, molecular, classifications, challenge, the, validity, of, the, genera, cromileptes, sometimes, spelled, chromileptes, and, anyperodon, each, of, these, two, genera, has, a, single, species, which, were, included, in, the, same, clade, as, species, of, epinephelus, in, a, study, based, on, five, different, genes, the, subfamilies, and, genera, are, as, follows
