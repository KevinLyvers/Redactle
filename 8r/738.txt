jackals, are, canids, native, to, africa, and, eurasia, while, the, word, jackal, has, historically, been, used, for, many, canines, of, the, subtribe, canina, in, modern, use, it, most, commonly, refers, to, three, species, the, closely, related, black, backed, jackal, lupulella, mesomelas, and, side, striped, jackal, lupulella, adusta, of, sub, saharan, africa, and, the, golden, jackal, canis, aureus, of, south, central, europe, and, asia, the, african, golden, wolf, canis, lupaster, was, also, formerly, considered, a, jackal, while, they, do, not, form, a, monophyletic, clade, all, jackals, are, opportunistic, omnivores, predators, of, small, to, medium, sized, animals, and, proficient, scavengers, their, long, legs, and, curved, canine, teeth, are, adapted, for, hunting, small, mammals, birds, and, reptiles, and, their, large, feet, and, fused, leg, bones, give, them, a, physique, well, suited, for, long, distance, running, capable, of, maintaining, speeds, of, 16, km, h, 10, mph, for, extended, periods, of, time, jackals, are, crepuscular, most, active, at, dawn, and, dusk, their, most, common, social, unit, is, a, monogamous, pair, which, defends, its, territory, from, other, pairs, by, vigorously, chasing, intruders, and, marking, landmarks, around, the, territory, with, their, urine, and, feces, the, territory, may, be, large, enough, to, hold, some, young, adults, which, stay, with, their, parents, until, they, establish, their, own, territories, jackals, may, occasionally, assemble, in, small, packs, for, example, to, scavenge, a, carcass, but, they, normally, hunt, either, alone, or, in, pairs, the, english, word, jackal, dates, back, to, 1600, and, derives, from, the, french, chacal, itself, from, turkish, akal, itself, from, persian, shagh, l, from, or, cognate, with, sanskrit, g, la, meaning, the, howler, dog, gray, wolf, coyote, golden, wolf, golden, jackal, ethiopian, wolf, dhole, african, wild, dog, side, striped, jackal, black, backed, jackal, similarities, between, jackals, and, coyotes, led, lorenz, oken, in, the, third, volume, of, his, lehrbuch, der, naturgeschichte, 1815, to, place, these, species, into, a, new, separate, genus, thos, named, after, the, classical, greek, word, jackal, but, his, theory, had, little, immediate, impact, on, taxonomy, at, the, time, angel, cabrera, in, his, 1932, monograph, on, the, mammals, of, morocco, questioned, whether, or, not, the, presence, of, a, cingulum, on, the, upper, molars, of, the, jackals, and, its, corresponding, absence, in, the, rest, of, canis, could, justify, a, subdivision, of, that, genus, in, practice, cabrera, chose, the, undivided, genus, alternative, and, referred, to, the, jackals, as, canis, instead, of, thos, oken, s, thos, theory, was, revived, in, 1914, by, edmund, heller, who, embraced, the, separate, genus, theory, heller, s, names, and, the, designations, he, gave, to, various, jackal, species, and, subspecies, live, on, in, current, taxonomy, although, the, genus, has, been, changed, from, thos, to, canis, the, wolf, like, canids, are, a, group, of, large, carnivores, that, are, genetically, closely, related, they, all, have, 78, chromosomes, the, group, includes, genus, canis, cuon, and, lycaon, the, members, are, the, dog, c, lupus, familiaris, gray, wolf, c, lupus, coyote, c, latrans, golden, jackal, c, aureus, ethiopian, wolf, c, simensis, black, backed, jackal, c, mesomelas, side, striped, jackal, c, adustus, dhole, cuon, alpinus, and, african, wild, dog, lycaon, pictus, the, latest, recognized, member, is, the, african, wolf, c, lupaster, which, was, once, thought, to, be, an, african, branch, of, the, golden, jackal, as, they, possess, 78, chromosomes, all, members, of, the, genus, canis, are, karyologically, indistinguishable, from, each, other, and, from, the, dhole, and, the, african, hunting, dog, the, two, african, jackals, are, shown, to, be, the, most, basal, members, of, this, clade, indicating, the, clade, s, origin, from, africa, canis, arnensis, arrived, in, mediterranean, europe, 1, 9, million, years, ago, and, is, probably, the, ancestor, of, modern, jackals, the, paraphyletic, nature, of, canis, with, respect, to, lycaon, and, cuon, has, led, to, suggestions, that, the, two, african, jackals, should, be, assigned, to, different, genera, schaeffia, for, the, side, striped, jackal, and, lupulella, for, the, black, backed, jackal, or, lupulella, for, both, the, intermediate, size, and, shape, of, the, ethiopian, wolf, has, at, times, led, it, to, be, regarded, as, a, jackal, thus, it, has, also, been, called, the, red, jackal, or, the, simien, jackal, like, foxes, and, coyotes, jackals, are, often, depicted, as, clever, sorcerers, in, the, myths, and, legends, of, their, regions, they, are, mentioned, roughly, 14, times, in, the, bible, it, is, frequently, used, as, a, literary, device, to, illustrate, desolation, loneliness, and, abandonment, with, reference, to, its, habit, of, living, in, the, ruins, of, former, cities, and, other, areas, abandoned, by, humans, it, is, called, wild, dog, in, several, translations, of, the, bible, in, the, king, james, bible, isaiah, 13, 21, refers, to, doleful, creatures, which, some, commentators, suggest, are, either, jackals, or, hyenas, in, the, indian, panchatantra, stories, the, jackal, is,
