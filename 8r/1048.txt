a, mango, is, an, edible, stone, fruit, produced, by, the, tropical, tree, mangifera, indica, it, originated, from, the, region, between, northwestern, myanmar, bangladesh, and, northeastern, india, m, indica, has, been, cultivated, in, south, and, southeast, asia, since, ancient, times, resulting, in, two, types, of, modern, mango, cultivars, the, indian, type, and, the, southeast, asian, type, other, species, in, the, genus, mangifera, also, produce, edible, fruits, that, are, also, called, mangoes, the, majority, of, which, are, found, in, the, malesian, ecoregion, worldwide, there, are, several, hundred, cultivars, of, mango, depending, on, the, cultivar, mango, fruit, varies, in, size, shape, sweetness, skin, color, and, flesh, color, which, may, be, pale, yellow, gold, green, or, orange, mango, is, the, national, fruit, of, india, pakistan, and, the, philippines, while, the, mango, tree, is, the, national, tree, of, bangladesh, the, english, word, mango, plural, mangoes, or, mangos, originated, in, the, 16th, century, from, the, portuguese, word, manga, from, the, malay, mangga, and, ultimately, from, the, tamil, man, mango, tree, kay, unripe, fruit, vegetable, the, scientific, name, mangifera, indica, refers, to, a, plant, bearing, mangoes, in, india, mango, trees, grow, to, 30, 40, metres, 98, 131, feet, tall, with, a, crown, radius, of, 10, 15, m, 33, 49, ft, the, trees, are, long, lived, as, some, specimens, still, fruit, after, 300, years, in, deep, soil, the, taproot, descends, to, a, depth, of, 6, m, 20, ft, with, profuse, wide, spreading, feeder, roots, and, anchor, roots, penetrating, deeply, into, the, soil, the, leaves, are, evergreen, alternate, simple, 15, 35, centimetres, 6, 14, inches, long, and, 6, 16, cm, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, in, broad, when, the, leaves, are, young, they, are, orange, pink, rapidly, changing, to, a, dark, glossy, red, then, dark, green, as, they, mature, the, flowers, are, produced, in, terminal, panicles, 10, 40, cm, 4, 15, 1, 2, in, long, each, flower, is, small, and, white, with, five, petals, 5, 10, millimetres, 3, 16, 3, 8, in, long, with, a, mild, sweet, fragrance, over, 500, varieties, of, mangoes, are, known, many, of, which, ripen, in, summer, while, some, give, a, double, crop, the, fruit, takes, four, to, five, months, from, flowering, to, ripening, the, ripe, fruit, varies, according, to, cultivar, in, size, shape, color, sweetness, and, eating, quality, depending, on, the, cultivar, fruits, are, variously, yellow, orange, red, or, green, the, fruit, has, a, single, flat, oblong, pit, that, can, be, fibrous, or, hairy, on, the, surface, and, does, not, separate, easily, from, the, pulp, the, fruits, may, be, somewhat, round, oval, or, kidney, shaped, ranging, from, 5, 25, centimetres, 2, 10, in, in, length, and, from, 140, grams, 5, oz, to, 2, kilograms, 5, lb, in, weight, per, individual, fruit, the, skin, is, leather, like, waxy, smooth, and, fragrant, with, colors, ranging, from, green, to, yellow, yellow, orange, yellow, red, or, blushed, with, various, shades, of, red, purple, pink, or, yellow, when, fully, ripe, ripe, intact, mangoes, give, off, a, distinctive, resinous, sweet, smell, inside, the, pit, 1, 2, mm, 0, 039, 0, 079, in, thick, is, a, thin, lining, covering, a, single, seed, 4, 7, cm, 1, 6, 2, 8, in, long, mangoes, have, recalcitrant, seeds, which, do, not, survive, freezing, and, drying, mango, trees, grow, readily, from, seeds, with, germination, success, highest, when, seeds, are, obtained, from, mature, fruits, mangoes, originated, from, the, region, between, northwestern, myanmar, bangladesh, and, northeastern, india, the, mango, is, considered, an, evolutionary, anachronism, whereby, seed, dispersal, was, once, accomplished, by, a, now, extinct, evolutionary, forager, such, as, a, megafauna, mammal, from, their, center, of, origin, mangoes, diverged, into, two, genetically, distinct, populations, the, subtropical, indian, group, and, the, tropical, southeast, asian, group, the, indian, group, is, characterized, by, having, monoembryonic, fruits, while, polyembryonic, fruits, characterize, the, southeast, asian, group, it, was, previously, believed, that, mangoes, originated, from, a, single, domestication, event, in, south, asia, before, being, spread, to, southeast, asia, but, a, 2019, study, found, no, evidence, of, a, center, of, diversity, in, india, instead, it, identified, a, higher, unique, genetic, diversity, in, southeast, asian, cultivars, than, in, indian, cultivars, indicating, that, mangoes, may, have, originally, been, domesticated, first, in, southeast, asia, before, being, introduced, to, south, asia, however, the, authors, also, cautioned, that, the, diversity, in, southeast, asian, mangoes, might, be, the, result, of, other, reasons, like, interspecific, hybridization, with, other, mangifera, species, native, to, the, malesian, ecoregion, nevertheless, the, existence, of, two, distinct, genetic, populations, also, identified, by, the, study, indicates, that, the, domestication, of, the, mango, is, more, complex, than, previously, assumed, and, would, at, least, indicate, multiple, domestication, events, in, southeast, asia, and, south, asia, there, are, hundreds, of, named, mango, cultivars, in, mango, orchards, several, cultivars, are, often, grown, to, improve, pollination, many, desired, cultivars, are, monoembryonic, and, must, be, propagated, by, grafting, or, they, do, not, breed, true, a, common, monoembryonic, cultivar, is, alphonso, an, important, export, product, considered, the, king, of, mangoes, cultivars, that, excel, in, one, climate, may, fail, elsewhere, for, example, indian, cultivars, such, as, julie, a, prolific, cultivar, in, jamaica, require, annual, fungicide, treatments, to, escape, the, lethal, fungal, disease, anthracnose, in, florida, asian, mangoes, are, resistant, to, anthracnose, the, current, world, market, is, dominated, by, the, cultivar, tommy, atkins, a, seedling, of, haden, that, first, fruited, in, 1940, in, southern, florida, and, was, initially, rejected, commercially, by, florida, researchers, growers, and, importers, worldwide, have, embraced, the, cultivar, for, its, excellent, productivity, and, disease, resistance, shelf, life, transportability, size, and, appealing, color, although, the, tommy, atkins, cultivar, is, commercially, successful, other, cultivars, may, be, preferred, by, consumers, for, eating, pleasure, such, as, alphonso, generally, ripe, mangoes, have, an, orange, yellow, or, reddish, peel, and, are, juicy, for, eating, while, exported, fruit, are, often, picked, while, underripe, with, green, peels, although, producing, ethylene, while, ripening, unripened, exported, mangoes, do, not, have, the, same, juiciness, or, flavor, as, fresh, fruit, from, tropical, asia, mangoes, were, introduced, to, east, africa, by, arab, and, persian, traders, in, the, ninth, to, tenth, centuries, the, 14th, century, moroccan, traveler, ibn, battuta, reported, it, at, mogadishu, it, was, spread, further, into, other, areas, around, the, world, during, the, colonial, era, the, portuguese, empire, spread, the, mango, from, their, colony, in, goa, to, east, and, west, africa, from, west, africa, they, introduced, it, to, brazil, from, the, 16th, to, the, 17th, centuries, from, brazil, it, spread, northwards, to, the, caribbean, and, eastern, mexico, by, the, mid, to, late, 18th, century, the, spanish, empire, also, introduced, mangoes, directly, from, the, philippines, to, western, mexico, via, the, manila, galleons, from, at, least, the, 16th, century, mangoes, were, only, introduced, to, florida, by, 1833, the, mango, is, now, cultivated, in, most, frost, free, tropical, and, warmer, subtropical, climates, it, is, cultivated, extensively, in, south, asia, southeast, asia, east, and, west, africa, the, tropical, and, subtropical, americas, and, the, caribbean, mangoes, are, also, grown, in, andalusia, spain, mainly, in, m, laga, province, as, its, coastal, subtropical, climate, is, one, of, the, few, places, in, mainland, europe, that, permits, the, growth, of, tropical, plants, and, fruit, trees, the, canary, islands, are, another, notable, spanish, producer, of, the, fruit, other, minor, cultivators, include, north, america, in, south, florida, and, the, california, coachella, valley, hawai, i, and, australia, many, commercial, cultivars, are, grafted, onto, the, cold, hardy, rootstock, of, the, gomera, 1, mango, cultivar, originally, from, cuba, its, root, system, is, well, adapted, to, a, coastal, mediterranean, climate, many, of, the, 1, 000, mango, cultivars, are, easily, cultivated, using, grafted, saplings, ranging, from, the, turpentine, mango, named, for, its, strong, taste, of, turpentine, to, the, bullock, s, heart, dwarf, or, semidwarf, varieties, serve, as, ornamental, plants, and, can, be, grown, in, containers, a, wide, variety, of, diseases, can, afflict, mangoes, a, breakthrough, in, mango, cultivation, was, the, use, of, potassium, nitrate, and, ethrel, to, induce, flowering, in, mangoes, the, discovery, was, made, by, filipino, horticulturist, ramon, barba, in, 1974, and, was, developed, from, the, unique, traditional, method, of, inducing, mango, flowering, using, smoke, in, the, philippines, it, allowed, mango, plantations, to, induce, regular, flowering, and, fruiting, year, round, previously, mangoes, were, seasonal, because, they, only, flowered, every, 16, to, 18, months, the, method, is, now, used, in, most, mango, producing, countries, in, 2022, world, production, of, mangoes, report, includes, mangosteens, and, guavas, was, 59, million, tonnes, led, by, india, with, 44, of, the, total, table, mangoes, are, generally, sweet, although, the, taste, and, texture, of, the, flesh, vary, across, cultivars, some, such, as, alphonso, have, a, soft, pulpy, juicy, texture, similar, to, an, overripe, plum, while, others, such, as, tommy, atkins, are, firmer, with, a, fibrous, texture, the, skin, of, unripe, pickled, or, cooked, mango, can, be, eaten, but, it, has, the, potential, to, cause, contact, dermatitis, of, the, lips, gingiva, or, tongue, in, susceptible, people, mangoes, are, used, in, many, cuisines, sour,

xanthonoids, mangiferin, and, gallic, acid, the, flavor, of, mango, fruits, is, conferred, by, several, volatile, organic, chemicals, mainly, belonging, to, terpene, furanone, lactone, and, ester, classes, different, varieties, or, cultivars, of, mangoes, can, have, flavors, made, up, of, different, volatile, chemicals, or, the, same, volatile, chemicals, in, different, quantities, in, general, new, world, mango, cultivars, are, characterized, by, the, dominance, of, 3, carene, a, monoterpene, flavorant, whereas, high, concentration, of, other, monoterpenes, such, as, z, ocimene, and, myrcene, as, well, as, the, presence, of, lactones, and, furanones, is, the, unique, feature, of, old, world, cultivars, in, india, alphonso, is, one, of, the, most, popular, cultivars, in, alphonso, mango, the, lactones, and, furanones, are, synthesized, during, ripening, whereas, terpenes, and, the, other, flavorants, are, present, in, both, the, developing, immature, and, ripening, fruits, ethylene, a, ripening, related, hormone, well, known, to, be, involved, in, ripening, of, mango, fruits, causes, changes, in, the, flavor, composition, of, mango, fruits, upon, exogenous, application, as, well, in, contrast, to, the, huge, amount, of, information, available, on, the, chemical, composition, of, mango, flavor, the, biosynthesis, of, these, chemicals, has, not, been, studied, in, depth, only, a, handful, of, genes, encoding, the, enzymes, of, flavor, biosynthetic, pathways, have, been, characterized, to, date, contact, with, oils, in, mango, leaves, stems, sap, and, skin, can, cause, dermatitis, and, anaphylaxis, in, susceptible, individuals, those, with, a, history, of, contact, dermatitis, induced, by, urushiol, an, allergen, found, in, poison, ivy, poison, oak, or, poison, sumac, may, be, most, at, risk, for, mango, contact, dermatitis, other, mango, compounds, potentially, responsible, for, dermatitis, or, allergic, reactions, include, mangiferin, cross, reactions, may, occur, between, mango, allergens, and, urushiol, sensitized, individuals, may, not, be, able, to, eat, peeled, mangos, or, drink, mango, juice, safely, when, mango, trees, are, flowering, in, spring, local, people, with, allergies, may, experience, breathing, difficulty, itching, of, the, eyes, or, facial, swelling, even, before, flower, pollen, becomes, airborne, in, this, case, the, irritant, is, likely, to, be, the, vaporized, essential, oil, from, flowers, during, the, primary, ripening, season, of, mangoes, contact, with, mango, plant, parts, primarily, sap, leaves,
