eucalyptus, ju, k, l, p, t, s, is, a, genus, of, more, than, 700, species, of, flowering, plants, in, the, family, myrtaceae, most, species, of, eucalyptus, are, trees, often, mallees, and, a, few, are, shrubs, along, with, several, other, genera, in, the, tribe, eucalypteae, including, corymbia, and, angophora, they, are, commonly, known, as, eucalypts, or, gum, trees, plants, in, the, genus, eucalyptus, have, bark, that, is, either, smooth, fibrous, hard, or, stringy, the, leaves, have, oil, glands, the, sepals, and, petals, are, fused, to, form, a, cap, or, operculum, over, the, stamens, hence, the, name, from, greek, e, well, kalupt, s, covered, the, fruit, is, a, woody, capsule, commonly, referred, to, as, a, gumnut, most, species, of, eucalyptus, are, native, to, australia, and, every, state, and, territory, has, representative, species, about, three, quarters, of, australian, forests, are, eucalypt, forests, many, eucalypt, species, have, adapted, to, wildfire, are, able, to, resprout, after, fire, or, have, seeds, that, survive, fire, a, few, species, are, native, to, islands, north, of, australia, and, a, smaller, number, are, only, found, outside, the, continent, eucalypts, have, been, grown, in, plantations, in, many, other, countries, because, they, are, fast, growing, have, valuable, timber, or, can, be, used, for, pulpwood, honey, production, or, essential, oils, in, some, countries, however, they, have, been, removed, because, of, the, danger, of, forest, fires, due, to, their, high, flammability, eucalypts, vary, in, size, and, habit, from, shrubs, to, tall, trees, trees, usually, have, a, single, main, stem, or, trunk, but, many, eucalypts, are, mallees, that, are, multistemmed, from, ground, level, and, rarely, taller, than, 10, metres, 33, feet, there, is, no, clear, distinction, between, a, mallee, and, a, shrub, but, in, eucalypts, a, shrub, is, a, mature, plant, less, than, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, tall, and, growing, in, an, extreme, environment, eucalyptus, vernicosa, in, the, tasmanian, highlands, e, yalatensis, on, the, nullarbor, and, e, surgens, growing, on, coastal, cliffs, in, western, australia, are, examples, of, eucalypt, shrubs, the, terms, mallet, and, marlock, are, only, applied, to, western, australian, eucalypts, a, mallet, is, a, tree, with, a, single, thin, trunk, with, a, steeply, branching, habit, but, lacks, both, a, lignotuber, and, epicormic, buds, eucalyptus, astringens, is, an, example, of, a, mallet, a, marlock, is, a, shrub, or, small, tree, with, a, single, short, trunk, that, lacks, a, lignotuber, and, has, spreading, densely, leafy, branches, that, often, reach, almost, to, the, ground, eucalyptus, platypus, is, an, example, of, a, marlock, eucalyptus, trees, including, mallets, and, marlocks, are, single, stemmed, and, include, eucalyptus, regnans, the, tallest, known, flowering, plant, on, earth, the, tallest, reliably, measured, tree, in, europe, karri, knight, can, be, found, in, coimbra, portugal, in, vale, de, canas, it, is, a, eucalyptus, diversicolor, of, 72, 9, meters, height, and, of, 5, 71, meters, girth, tree, sizes, follow, the, convention, of, all, eucalypts, add, a, layer, of, bark, every, year, and, the, outermost, layer, dies, in, about, half, of, the, species, the, dead, bark, is, shed, exposing, a, new, layer, of, fresh, living, bark, the, dead, bark, may, be, shed, in, large, slabs, in, ribbons, or, in, small, flakes, these, species, are, known, as, smooth, barks, and, include, e, sheathiana, e, diversicolor, e, cosmophylla, and, e, cladocalyx, the, remaining, species, retain, the, dead, bark, which, dries, out, and, accumulates, in, some, of, these, species, the, fibres, in, the, bark, are, loosely, intertwined, in, stringybarks, such, as, e, macrorhyncha, or, peppermints, such, as, e, radiata, or, more, tightly, adherent, as, in, the, boxes, such, as, e, leptophleba, in, some, species, the, ironbarks, such, as, e, crebra, and, e, jensenii, the, rough, bark, is, infused, with, gum, resin, many, species, are, half, barks, or, blackbutts, in, which, the, dead, bark, is, retained, in, the, lower, half, of, the, trunks, or, stems, for, example, e, brachycalyx, e, ochrophloia, and, e, occidentalis, or, only, in, a, thick, black, accumulation, at, the, base, as, in, e, clelandii, in, some, species, in, this, category, for, example, e, youngiana, and, e, viminalis, the, rough, basal, bark, is, very, ribbony, at, the, top, where, it, gives, way, to, the, smooth, upper, stems, the, smooth, upper, bark, of, the, half, barks, and, that, of, the, completely, smooth, barked, trees, and, mallees, can, produce, remarkable, colour, and, interest, for, example, e, deglupta, e, globulus, bark, cells, are, able, to, photosynthesize, in, the, absence, of, foliage, conferring, an, increased, capacity, to, re, fix, internal, co, 2, following, partial, defoliation, this, allows, the, tree, to, grow, in, less, than, ideal, climates, in, addition, to, providing, a, better, chance, of, recovery, from, damage, sustained, to, its, leaves, in, an, event, such, as, a, fire, different, commonly, recognised, types, of, bark, include, nearly, all, eucalyptus, are, evergreen, but, some, tropical, species, lose, their, leaves, at, the, end, of, the, dry, season, as, in, other, members, of, the, myrtle, family, eucalyptus, leaves, are, covered, with, oil, glands, the, copious, oils, produced, are, an, important, feature, of, the, genus, although, mature, eucalyptus, trees, may, be, towering, and, fully, leafed, their, shade, is, characteristically, patchy, because, the, leaves, usually, hang, downwards, the, leaves, on, a, mature, eucalyptus, plant, are, commonly, lanceolate, petiolate, apparently, alternate, and, waxy, or, glossy, green, in, contrast, the, leaves, of, seedlings, are, often, opposite, sessile, and, glaucous, but, many, exceptions, to, this, pattern, exist, many, species, such, as, e, melanophloia, and, e, setosa, retain, the, juvenile, leaf, form, even, when, the, plant, is, reproductively, mature, some, species, such, as, e, macrocarpa, e, rhodantha, and, e, crucis, are, sought, after, ornamentals, due, to, this, lifelong, juvenile, leaf, form, a, few, species, such, as, e, petraea, e, dundasii, and, e, lansdowneana, have, shiny, green, leaves, throughout, their, life, cycle, eucalyptus, caesia, exhibits, the, opposite, pattern, of, leaf, development, to, most, eucalyptus, with, shiny, green, leaves, in, the, seedling, stage, and, dull, glaucous, leaves, in, mature, crowns, the, contrast, between, juvenile, and, adult, leaf, phases, is, valuable, in, field, identification, four, leaf, phases, are, recognised, in, the, development, of, a, eucalyptus, plant, the, seedling, juvenile, intermediate, and, adult, phases, however, no, definite, transitional, point, occurs, between, the, phases, the, intermediate, phase, when, the, largest, leaves, are, often, formed, links, the, juvenile, and, adult, phases, in, all, except, a, few, species, the, leaves, form, in, pairs, on, opposite, sides, of, a, square, stem, consecutive, pairs, being, at, right, angles, to, each, other, decussate, in, some, narrow, leaved, species, for, example, e, oleosa, the, seedling, leaves, after, the, second, leaf, pair, are, often, clustered, in, a, detectable, spiral, arrangement, about, a, five, sided, stem, after, the, spiral, phase, which, may, last, from, several, to, many, nodes, the, arrangement, reverts, to, decussate, by, the, absorption, of, some, of, the, leaf, bearing, faces, of, the, stem, in, those, species, with, opposite, adult, foliage, the, leaf, pairs, which, have, been, formed, opposite, at, the, stem, apex, become, separated, at, their, bases, by, unequal, elongation, of, the, stem, to, produce, the, apparently, alternate, adult, leaves, the, most, readily, recognisable, characteristics, of, eucalyptus, species, are, the, distinctive, flowers, and, fruit, capsules, or, gumnuts, flowers, have, numerous, fluffy, stamens, which, may, be, white, cream, yellow, pink, or, red, in, bud, the, stamens, are, enclosed, in, a, cap, known, as, an, operculum, which, is, composed, of, the, fused, sepals, or, petals, or, both, thus, flowers, have, no, petals, but, instead, decorate, themselves, with, the, many, showy, stamens, as, the, stamens, expand, the, operculum, is, forced, off, splitting, away, from, the, cup, like, base, of, the, flower, this, is, one, of, the, features, that, unites, the, genus, the, woody, fruits, or, capsules, are, roughly, cone, shaped, and, have, valves, at, the, end, which, open, to, release, the, seeds, which, are, waxy, rod, shaped, about, 1, mm, in, length, and, yellow, brown, in, colour, most, species, do, not, flower, until, adult, foliage, starts, to, appear, e, cinerea, and, e, perriniana, are, notable, exceptions, the, genus, eucalyptus, was, first, formally, described, in, 1789, by, charles, louis, l, h, ritier, de, brutelle, who, published, the, description, in, his, book, sertum, anglicum, seu, plantae, rariores, quae, in, hortis, juxta, londinum, along, with, a, description, of, the, type, species, eucalyptus, obliqua, the, name, eucalyptus, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, words, eu, meaning, good, 373, and, kalypto, meaning, i, cover, conceal, hide, 234, referring, to, the, operculum, covering, the, flower, buds, the, type, specimen, was, collected, in, 1777, by, david, nelson, the, gardener, botanist, on, cook, s, third, voyage, he, collected, the, specimen, on, bruny, island, and, sent, it, to, de, brutelle, who, was, working, in, london, at, that, time, although, eucalypts, must, have, been, seen, by, the, very, early, european, explorers, and, collectors, no, botanical, collections, of, them, are, known, to, have, been, made, until, 1770, when, joseph, banks, and, daniel, solander, arrived, at, botany, bay, with, captain, james, cook, there, they, collected, specimens, of, e, gummifera, and, later, near, the, endeavour, river, in, northern, queensland, e, platyphylla, neither, of, these, species, was, named, as, such, at, the, time, in, 1777, on, cook, s, third, expedition, david, nelson, collected, a, eucalypt, on, bruny, island, in, southern, tasmania, this, specimen, was, taken, to, the, british, museum, in, london, and, was, named, eucalyptus, obliqua, by, the, french, botanist, l, h, ritier, who, was, working, in, london, at, the, time, he, coined, the, generic, name, from, the, greek, roots, eu, and, calyptos, meaning, well, and, covered, in, reference, to, the, operculum, of, the, flower, bud, which, protects, the, developing, flower, parts, as, the, flower, develops, and, is, shed, by, the, pressure, of, the, emerging, stamens, at, flowering, the, name, obliqua, was, derived, from, the, latin, obliquus, meaning, oblique, which, is, the, botanical, term, describing, a, leaf, base, where, the, two, sides, of, the, leaf, blade, are, of, unequal, length, and, do, not, meet, the, petiole, at, the, same, place, e, obliqua, was, published, in, 1788, 89, which, coincided, with, the, european, colonisation, of, australia, between, then, and, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, several, more, species, of, eucalyptus, were, named, and, published, most, of, these, were, by, the, english, botanist, james, edward, smith, and, most, were, as, might, be, expected, trees, of, the, sydney, region, these, include, the, economically, valuable, e, pilularis, e, saligna, and, e, tereticornis, the, first, endemic, western, australian, eucalyptus, to, be, collected, and, subsequently, named, was, the, yate, e, cornuta, by, the, french, botanist, jacques, labillardi, re, who, collected, in, what, is, now, the, esperance, area, in, 1792, several, australian, botanists, were, active, during, the, 19th, century, particularly, ferdinand, von, mueller, whose, work, on, eucalypts, contributed, greatly, to, the, first, comprehensive, account, of, the, genus, in, george, bentham, s, flora, australiensis, in, 1867, the, account, is, the, most, important, early, systematic, treatment, of, the, genus, bentham, divided, it, into, five, series, whose, distinctions, were, based, on, characteristics, of, the, stamens, particularly, the, anthers, mueller, 1879, 84, work, elaborated, by, joseph, henry, maiden, 1903, 33, and, still, further, by, william, faris, blakely, 1934, the, anther, system, became, too, complex, to, be, workable, and, more, recent, systematic, work, has, concentrated, on, the, characteristics, of, buds, fruits, leaves, and, bark, over, 700, species, of, eucalyptus, are, known, some, have, diverged, from, the, mainstream, of, the, genus, to, the, extent, that, they, are, quite, isolated, genetically, and, are, able, to, be, recognised, by, only, a, few, relatively, invariant, characteristics, most, however, may, be, regarded, as, belonging, to, large, or, small, groups, of, related, species, which, are, often, in, geographical, contact, with, each, other, and, between, which, gene, exchange, still, occurs, in, these, situations, many, species, appear, to, grade, into, one, another, and, intermediate, forms, are, common, in, other, words, some, species, are, relatively, fixed, genetically, as, expressed, in, their, morphology, while, others, have, not, diverged, completely, from, their, nearest, relatives, hybrid, individuals, have, not, always, been, recognised, as, such, on, first, collection, and, some, have, been, named, as, new, species, such, as, e, chrysantha, e, preissiana, e, sepulcralis, and, e, rivalis, e, marginata, e, megacarpa, hybrid, combinations, are, not, particularly, common, in, the, field, but, some, other, published, species, frequently, seen, in, australia, have, been, suggested, to, be, hybrid, combinations, for, example, eucalyptus, erythrandra, is, believed, to, be, e, angulosa, e, teraptera, and, due, to, its, wide, distribution, is, often, referred, to, in, texts, renantherin, a, phenolic, compound, present, in, the, leaves, of, some, eucalyptus, species, allows, chemotaxonomic, discrimination, in, the, sections, renantheroideae, and, renantherae, and, the, ratio, of, the, amount, of, leucoanthocyanins, varies, considerably, in, certain, species, eucalyptus, is, one, of, three, similar, genera, that, are, commonly, referred, to, as, eucalypts, the, others, being, corymbia, and, angophora, many, species, though, by, no, means, all, are, known, as, gum, trees, because, they, exude, copious, kino, from, any, break, in, the, bark, e, g, scribbly, gum, the, generic, name, is, derived, from, the, greek, words, eu, well, and, kal, pto, to, cover, referring, to, the, operculum, on, the, calyx, that, initially, conceals, the, flower, there, are, more, than, 700, species, of, eucalyptus, and, most, are, native, to, australia, a, very, small, number, are, found, in, adjacent, areas, of, new, guinea, and, indonesia, one, species, eucalyptus, deglupta, ranges, as, far, north, as, the, philippines, of, the, 15, species, found, outside, australia, just, nine, are, exclusively, non, australian, species, of, eucalyptus, are, cultivated, widely, in, the, tropical, and, temperate, world, including, the, americas, europe, africa, the, mediterranean, basin, the, middle, east, china, and, the, indian, subcontinent, however, the, range, over, which, many, eucalypts, can, be, planted, in, the, temperate, zone, is, constrained, by, their, limited, cold, tolerance, australia, is, covered, by, 92, 000, 000, hectares, 230, 000, 000, acres, of, eucalypt, forest, comprising, three, quarters, of, the, area, covered, by, native, forest, the, blue, mountains, of, southeastern, australia, have, been, a, centre, of, eucalypt, diversification, their, name, is, in, reference, to, the, blue, haze, prevalent, in, the, area, believed, derived, from, the, volatile, terpenoids, emitted, by, these, trees, the, oldest, definitive, eucalyptus, fossils, are, from, patagonia, in, south, america, where, eucalypts, are, no, longer, native, though, they, have, been, introduced, from, australia, the, fossils, are, from, the, early, eocene, 51, 9, mya, and, were, found, in, the, laguna, del, hunco, formation, in, chubut, province, in, argentina, this, shows, that, the, genus, had, a, gondwanan, distribution, fossil, leaves, also, occur, in, the, miocene, of, new, zealand, where, the, genus, is, not, native, today, but, again, have, been, introduced, from, australia, despite, the, prominence, of, eucalyptus, in, modern, australia, estimated, to, contribute, some, 75, of, the, modern, vegetation, the, fossil, record, is, very, scarce, throughout, much, of, the, cenozoic, and, suggests, that, this, rise, to, dominance, is, a, geologically, more, recent, phenomenon, the, oldest, reliably, dated, macrofossil, of, eucalyptus, is, a, 21, million, year, old, tree, stump, encased, in, basalt, in, the, upper, lachlan, valley, in, new, south, wales, other, fossils, have, been, found, but, many, are, either, unreliably, dated, or, else, unreliably, identified, it, is, useful, to, consider, where, eucalyptus, fossils, have, not, been, found, extensive, research, has, gone, into, the, fossil, floras, of, the, paleocene, to, oligocene, of, south, eastern, australia, and, has, failed, to, uncover, a, single, eucalyptus, specimen, although, the, evidence, is, sparse, the, best, hypothesis, is, that, in, the, mid, tertiary, the, continental, margins, of, australia, only, supported, more, mesic, noneucalypt, vegetation, and, that, eucalypts, probably, contributed, to, the, drier, vegetation, of, the, arid, continental, interior, with, the, progressive, drying, out, of, the, continent, since, the, miocene, eucalypts, were, displaced, to, the, continental, margins, and, much, of, the, mesic, and, rainforest, vegetation, that, was, once, there, was, eliminated, the, current, superdominance, of, eucalyptus, in, australia, may, be, an, artefact, of, human, influence, on, its, ecology, in, more, recent, sediments, numerous, findings, of, a, dramatic, increase, in, the, abundance, of, eucalyptus, pollen, are, associated, with, increased, charcoal, levels, though, this, occurs, at, different, rates, throughout, australia, it, is, compelling, evidence, for, a, relationship, between, the, artificial, increase, of, fire, frequency, with, the, arrival, of, aboriginals, and, increased, prevalence, of, this, exceptionally, fire, tolerant, genus, several, eucalypt, species, are, among, the, tallest, trees, in, the, world, eucalyptus, regnans, the, australian, mountain, ash, is, the, tallest, of, all, flowering, plants, angiosperms, today, the, tallest, measured, specimen, named, centurion, is, 100, 5, m, 330, ft, tall, coast, douglas, fir, is, about, the, same, height, only, coast, redwood, is, taller, and, they, are, conifers, gymnosperms, six, other, eucalypt, species, exceed, 80, metres, in, height, eucalyptus, obliqua, eucalyptus, delegatensis, eucalyptus, diversicolor, eucalyptus, nitens, eucalyptus, globulus, and, eucalyptus, viminalis, most, eucalypts, are, not, tolerant, of, severe, cold, eucalypts, do, well, in, a, range, of, climates, but, are, usually, damaged, by, anything, beyond, a, light, frost, of, 5, c, 23, f, the, hardiest, are, the, snow, gums, such, as, eucalyptus, pauciflora, which, is, capable, of, withstanding, cold, and, frost, down, to, about, 20, c, 4, f, two, subspecies, e, pauciflora, subsp, niphophila, and, e, pauciflora, subsp, debeuzevillei, in, particular, are, even, hardier, and, can, tolerate, even, quite, severe, winters, several, other, species, especially, from, the, high, plateau, and, mountains, of, central, tasmania, such, as, eucalyptus, coccifera, eucalyptus, subcrenulata, and, eucalyptus, gunnii, have, also, produced, extreme, cold, hardy, forms, and, it, is, seed, procured, from, these, genetically, hardy, strains, that, are, planted, for, ornament, in, colder, parts, of, the, world, an, essential, oil, extracted, from, eucalyptus, leaves, contains, compounds, that, are, powerful, natural, disinfectants, and, can, be, toxic, in, large, quantities, several, marsupial, herbivores, notably, koalas, and, some, possums, are, relatively, tolerant, of, it, the, close, correlation, of, these, oils, with, other, more, potent, toxins, called, formylated, phloroglucinol, compounds, euglobals, macrocarpals, and, sideroxylonals, allows, koalas, and, other, marsupial, species, to, make, food, choices, based, on, the, smell, of, the, leaves, for, koalas, these, compounds, are, the, most, important, factor, in, leaf, choice, the, eusocial, beetle, austroplatypus, incompertus, makes, and, defends, its, galleries, exclusively, inside, eucalypts, including, some, species, of, eucalyptus, and, corymbia, fungal, species, mycosphaerella, and, teratosphaeria, have, been, associated, with, leaf, disease, on, various, eucalyptus, species, several, fungal, species, from, teratosphaeriaceae, family, are, causal, agents, in, leaf, diseases, and, stem, cankers, of, eucalyptus, in, uruguay, and, australia, eucalypts, originated, between, 35, and, 50, million, years, ago, not, long, after, australia, new, guinea, separated, from, gondwana, their, rise, coinciding, with, an, increase, in, fossil, charcoal, deposits, suggesting, that, fire, was, a, factor, even, then, but, they, remained, a, minor, component, of, the, tertiary, rainforest, until, about, 20, million, years, ago, when, the, gradual, drying, of, the, continent, and, depletion, of, soil, nutrients, led, to, the, development, of, a, more, open, forest, type, predominantly, casuarina, and, acacia, species, the, two, valuable, timber, trees, alpine, ash, e, delegatensis, and, australian, mountain, ash, e, regnans, are, killed, by, fire, and, only, regenerate, from, seed, the, same, 2003, bushfire, that, had, little, impact, on, forests, around, canberra, resulted, in, thousands, of, hectares, of, dead, ash, forests, however, a, small, amount, of, ash, survived, and, put, out, new, ash, trees, as, well, eucalyptus, oil, is, highly, flammable, and, at, high, enough, temperatures, the, oil, expands,

to, regenerate, from, epicormic, buds, situated, deep, within, their, thick, bark, or, from, lignotubers, or, by, producing, serotinous, fruits, in, seasonally, dry, climates, oaks, are, often, fire, resistant, particularly, in, open, grasslands, as, a, grass, fire, is, insufficient, to, ignite, the, scattered, trees, in, contrast, a, eucalyptus, forest, tends, to, promote, fire, because, of, the, volatile, and, highly, combustible, oils, produced, by, the, leaves, as, well, as, the, production, of, large, amounts, of, litter, high, in, phenolics, preventing, its, breakdown, by, fungi, and, thus, accumulating, as, large, amounts, of, dry, combustible, fuel, consequently, dense, eucalypt, plantings, may, be, subject, to, catastrophic, firestorms, in, fact, almost, thirty, years, before, the, oakland, firestorm, of, 1991, a, study, of, eucalyptus, in, the, area, warned, that, the, litter, beneath, the, trees, builds, up, very, rapidly, and, should, be, regularly, monitored, and, removed, it, has, been, estimated, that, 70, of, the, energy, released, through, the, combustion, of, vegetation, in, the, oakland, fire, was, due, to, eucalyptus, in, a, national, park, service, study, it, was, found, that, the, fuel, load, in, tons, per, acre, of, non, native, eucalyptus, woods, is, almost, three, times, as, great, as, native, oak, woodland, during, world, war, ii, one, california, town, cut, down, their, eucalyptus, trees, to, about, a, third, of, their, height, in, the, vicinity, of, anti, aircraft, guns, because, of, the, known, fire, fueling, qualities, of, the, trees, with, the, mayor, telling, a, newspaper, reporter, if, a, shell, so, much, as, hits, a, leaf, it, s, supposed, to, explode, some, species, of, eucalyptus, drop, branches, unexpectedly, in,

damage, from, dropped, branches, even, in, the, face, of, lengthy, well, publicised, protests, to, protect, particular, trees, a, former, australian, national, botanic, gardens, director, and, consulting, arborist, robert, boden, has, been, quoted, referring, to, summer, branch, drop, dropping, of, branches, is, recognised, in, australia, literature, through, the, fictional, death, of, judy, in, seven, little, australians, although, all, large, trees, can, drop, branches, the, density, of, eucalyptus, wood, is, high, due, to, its, high, resin, content, increasing, the, hazard, eucalypts, were, introduced, from, australia, to, the, rest, of, the, world, following, the, cook, expedition, in, 1770, collected, by, sir, joseph, banks, botanist, on, the, expedition, they, were, subsequently, introduced, to, many, parts, of, the, world, notably, california, southern, europe, africa, the, middle, east, south, asia, and, south, america, about, 250, species, are, under, cultivation, in, california, in, portugal, and, also, spain, eucalypts, have, been, grown, in, plantations, for, the, production, of, pulpwood, eucalyptus, are, the, basis, for, several, industries, such, as, sawmilling, pulp, charcoal, and, others, several, species, have, become, invasive, and, are, causing, major, problems, for, local, ecosystems, mainly, due, to, the, absence, of, wildlife, corridors, and, rotations, management, eucalypts, have, many, uses, which, have, made, them, economically, important, trees, and, they, have, become, a, cash, crop, in, poor, areas, such, as, timbuktu, mali, 22, and, the, peruvian, andes, despite, concerns, that, the, trees, are, invasive, in, some, environments, like, those, of, south, africa, best, known, are, perhaps, the, varieties, karri, and, yellow, box, due, to, their, fast, growth, the, foremost, benefit, of, these, trees, is, their, wood, they, can, be, chopped, off, at, the, root, and, grow, back, again, they, provide, many, desirable, characteristics, for, use, as, ornament, timber, firewood, and, pulpwood, eucalyptus, wood, is, also, used, in, a, number, of, industries, from, fence, posts, where, the, oil, rich, wood, s, high, resistance, to, decay, is, valued, and, charcoal, to, cellulose, extraction, for, biofuels, fast, growth, also, makes, eucalypts, suitable, as, windbreaks, and, to, reduce, erosion, some, eucalyptus, species, have, attracted, attention, from, horticulturists, global, development, researchers, and, environmentalists, because, of, desirable, traits, such, as, being, fast, growing, sources, of, wood, producing, oil, that, can, be, used, for, cleaning, and, as, a, natural, insecticide, or, an, ability, to, be, used, to, drain, swamps, and, thereby, reduce, the, risk, of, malaria, eucalyptus, oil, finds, many, uses, like, in, fuels, fragrances, insect, repellence, and, antimicrobial, activity, eucalyptus, trees, show, allelopathic, effects, they, release, compounds, which, inhibit, other, plant, species, from, growing, nearby, outside, their, natural, ranges, eucalypts, are, both, lauded, for, their, beneficial, economic, impact, on, poor, populations, 22, and, criticised, for, being, water, guzzling, aliens, leading, to, controversy, over, their, total, impact, eucalypts, draw, a, tremendous, amount, of, water, from, the, soil, through, the, process, of, transpiration, they, have, been, planted, or, re, planted, in, some, places, to, lower, the, water, table, and, reduce, soil, salination, eucalypts, have, also, been, used, as, a, way, of, reducing, malaria, by, draining, the, soil, in, algeria, lebanon, sicily, elsewhere, in, europe, in, the, caucasus, western, georgia, and, california, drainage, removes, swamps, which, provide, a, habitat, for, mosquito, larvae, but, can, also, destroy, ecologically, productive, areas, this, drainage, is, not, limited, to, the, soil, surface, because, the, eucalyptus, roots, are, up, to, 2, 5, m, 8, ft, 2, in, in, length, and, can, depending, on, the, location, even, reach, the, phreatic, zone, eucalyptus, is, the, most, common, short, fibre, source, for, pulpwood, to, make, pulp, the, types, most, often, used, in, papermaking, are, eucalyptus, globulus, in, temperate, areas, and, the, eucalyptus, urophylla, x, eucalyptus, grandis, hybrid, in, the, tropics, the, fibre, length, of, eucalyptus, is, relatively, short, and, uniform, with, low, coarseness, compared, with, other, hardwoods, commonly, used, as, pulpwood, the, fibres, are, slender, yet, relatively, thick, walled, this, gives, uniform, paper, formation, and, high, opacity, that, are, important, for, all, types, of, fine, papers, the, low, coarseness, is, important, for, high, quality, coated, papers, eucalyptus, is, suitable, for, many, tissue, papers, as, the, short, and, slender, fibres, gives, a, high, number, of, fibres, per, gram, and, low, coarseness, contributes, to, softness, eucalyptus, oil, is, readily, steam, distilled, from, the, leaves, and, can, be, used, for, cleaning, and, as, an, industrial, solvent, as, an, antiseptic, for, deodorising, and, in, very, small, quantities, in, food, supplements, especially, sweets, cough, drops, toothpaste, and, decongestants, it, has, insect, repellent, properties, and, serves, as, an, active, ingredient, in, some, commercial, mosquito, repellents, aromatherapists, have, adopted, eucalyptus, oils, for, a, wide, range, of, purposes, eucalyptus, globulus, is, the, principal, source, of, eucalyptus, oil, worldwide, eucalypt, wood, is, also, commonly, used, to, make, didgeridoos, a, traditional, australian, aboriginal, wind, instrument, the, trunk, of, the, tree, is, hollowed, out, by, termites, and, then, cut, down, if, the, bore, is, of, the, correct, size, and, shape, eucalypt, wood, is, also, being, used, as, a, tonewood, and, a, fingerboard, material, for, acoustic, guitars, notably, by, the, california, based, taylor, company, all, parts, of, eucalyptus, may, be, used, to, make, dyes, that, are, substantive, on, protein, fibres, such, as, silk, and, wool, simply, by, processing, the, plant, part, with, water, colours, to, be, achieved, range, from, yellow, and, orange, through, green, tan, chocolate, and, deep, rust, red, the, material, remaining, after, processing, can, be, safely, used, as, mulch, or, fertiliser, eucalyptus, trees, in, the, australian, outback, draw, up, gold, from, tens, of, metres, underground, through, their, root, system, and, deposit, it, as, particles, in, their, leaves, and, branches, a, maia, detector, for, x, ray, elemental, imaging, at, the, australian, synchrotron, clearly, showed, deposits, of, gold, and, other, metals, in, the, structure, of, eucalyptus, leaves, from, the, kalgoorlie, region, of, western, australia, that, would, have, been, untraceable, using, other, methods, the, microscopic, leaf, bound, nuggets, about, 8, micrometres, wide, on, average, are, not, worth, collecting, themselves, but, may, provide, an, environmentally, benign, way, of, locating, subsurface, mineral, deposits, in, the, 20th, century, scientists, around, the, world, experimented, with, eucalyptus, species, they, hoped, to, grow, them, in, the, tropics, but, most, experimental, results, failed, until, breakthroughs, in, the, 1960s, 1980s, in, species, selection, silviculture, and, breeding, programs, unlocked, the, potential, of, eucalypts, in, the, tropics, prior, to, then, as, brett, bennett, noted, in, a, 2010, article, eucalypts, were, something, of, the, el, dorado, of, forestry, today, eucalyptus, is, the, most, widely, planted, type, of, tree, in, plantations, around, the, world, in, south, america, mainly, in, brazil, argentina, paraguay, and, uruguay, south, africa, australia, india, galicia, portugal, and, many, more, in, the, 1850s, eucalyptus, trees, were, introduced, to, california, by, australians, during, the, california, gold, rush, much, of, california, is, similar, in, climate, to, parts, of, australia, by, the, early, 1900s, thousands, of, acres, of, eucalypts, were, planted, with, the, encouragement, of, the, state, government, it, was, hoped, that, they, would, provide, a, renewable, source, of, timber, for, construction, furniture, making, and, railway, sleepers, it, was, soon, found, that, for, the, latter, purpose, eucalyptus, was, particularly, unsuitable, as, the, ties, made, from, eucalyptus, had, a, tendency, to, twist, while, drying, and, the, dried, ties, were, so, tough, that, it, was, nearly, impossible, to, hammer, rail, spikes, into, them, they, went, on, to, note, that, the, promise, of, eucalyptus, in, california, was, based, on, the, old, virgin, forests, of, australia, this, was, a, mistake, as, the, young, trees, being, harvested, in, california, could, not, compare, in, quality, to, the, centuries, old, eucalyptus, timber, of, australia, it, reacted, differently, to, harvest, the, older, trees, didn, t, split, or, warp, as, the, infant, california, crop, did, there, was, a, vast, difference, between, the, two, and, this, would, doom, the, california, eucalyptus, industry, the, species, eucalyptus, rostrata, e, tereticornas, and, e, cladocalyx, are, all, present, in, california, but, the, blue, gum, e, globulus, makes, up, by, far, the, largest, population, in, the, state, one, way, in, which, the, eucalyptus, mainly, the, blue, gum, e, globulus, proved, valuable, in, california, was, in, providing, windbreaks, for, highways, orange, groves, and, farms, in, the, mostly, treeless, central, part, of, the, state, they, are, also, admired, as, shade, and, ornamental, trees, in, many, cities, and, gardens, eucalyptus, plantations, in, california, have, been, criticised, because, they, compete, with, native, plants, and, typically, do, not, support, native, animals, eucalyptus, has, historically, been, planted, to, replace, california, s, coast, live, oak, population, and, the, new, eucalyptus, is, not, as, hospitable, to, native, flora, and, fauna, as, the, oaks, in, appropriately, foggy, conditions, on, the, california, coast, eucalyptus, can, spread, at, a, rapid, rate, the, absence, of, natural, inhibitors, such, as, the, koala, or, pathogens, native, to, australia, have, aided, in, the, spread, of, california, eucalyptus, trees, this, is, not, as, big, of, an, issue, further, inland, but, on, the, coast, invasive, eucalypts, can, disrupt, native, ecosystems, eucalyptus, may, have, adverse, effects, on, local, streams, due, to, their, chemical, composition, and, their, dominance, threatens, species, that, rely, on, native, trees, nevertheless, some, native, species, have, been, known, to, adapt, to, the, eucalyptus, trees, notable, examples, are, herons, great, horned, owl, and, the, monarch, butterfly, using, eucalyptus, groves, as, habitat, despite, these, successes, eucalypts, generally, has, a, net, negative, impact, on, the, overall, balance, of, the, native, ecosystem, fire, is, also, a, problem, eucalypts, has, been, noted, for, their, flammable, properties, and, the, large, fuel, loads, in, the, understory, of, eucalypt, forests, eucalyptus, trees, were, a, catalyst, for, the, spread, of, the, 1923, fire, in, berkeley, which, destroyed, 568, homes, the, 1991, oakland, hills, firestorm, which, caused, us, 1, 5, billion, in, damage, destroyed, almost, 3, 000, homes, and, killed, 25, people, was, partly, fueled, by, large, numbers, of, eucalypts, close, to, the, houses, despite, these, issues, there, are, calls, to, preserve, the, eucalyptus, plants, in, california, advocates, for, the, tree, claim, its, fire, risk, has, been, overstated, some, even, claim, that, the, eucalyptus, s, absorption, of, moisture, makes, it, a, barrier, against, fire, these, experts, believe, that, the, herbicides, used, to, remove, the, eucalyptus, would, negatively, impact, the, ecosystem, and, the, loss, of, the, trees, would, release, carbon, into, the, atmosphere, unnecessarily, there, is, also, an, aesthetic, argument, for, keeping, the, eucalyptus, the, trees, are, viewed, by, many, as, an, attractive, and, iconic, part, of, the, california, landscape, many, say, that, although, the, tree, is, not, native, it, has, been, in, california, long, enough, to, become, an, essential, part, of, the, ecosystem, and, therefore, should, not, be, attacked, as, invasive, these, arguments, have, caused, experts, and, citizens, in, california, especially, in, the, san, francisco, bay, area, to, debate, the, merits, of, eucalyptus, removal, versus, preservation, however, the, general, consensus, remains, that, some, areas, urgently, require, eucalyptus, management, to, stave, off, potential, fire, hazards, efforts, to, remove, some, of, california, s, eucalyptus, trees, have, been, met, with, a, mixed, reaction, from, the, public, and, there, have, been, protests, against, removal, removing, eucalyptus, trees, can, be, expensive, and, often, requires, machinery, or, the, use, of, herbicides, the, trees, struggle, to, reproduce, on, their, own, outside, of, the, foggy, regions, of, coastal, california, and, therefore, some, inland, eucalyptus, forests, are, predicted, to, die, out, naturally, in, some, parts, of, california, eucalypt, plantations, are, being, removed, and, native, trees, and, plants, restored, individuals, have, also, illegally, destroyed, some, trees, and, are, suspected, of, introducing, insect, pests, from, australia, which, attack, the, trees, certain, eucalyptus, species, may, also, be, grown, for, ornament, in, warmer, parts, of, the, pacific, northwest, western, washington, western, oregon, and, southwestern, british, columbia, it, was, introduced, in, argentina, around, 1870, by, president, domingo, f, sarmiento, who, had, brought, the, seeds, from, australia, and, it, quickly, became, very, popular, the, most, widely, planted, species, were, e, globulus, e, viminalis, and, e, rostrata, currently, the, humid, pampas, region, has, small, forests, and, eucalyptus, barriers, some, up, to, 80, years, old, about, 50, meters, high, and, a, maximum, of, one, meter, in, diameter, antonio, lussich, introduced, eucalyptus, into, uruguay, in, approximately, 1896, throughout, what, is, now, maldonado, department, and, it, has, spread, all, over, the, south, eastern, and, eastern, coast, there, had, been, no, trees, in, the, area, because, it, consisted, of, dry, sand, dunes, and, stones, lussich, also, introduced, many, other, trees, particularly, acacia, and, pines, but, they, have, not, expanded, so, extensively, uruguayan, forestry, crops, using, eucalyptus, species, have, been, promoted, since, 1989, when, the, new, national, forestry, law, established, that, 20, of, the, national, territory, would, be, dedicated, to, forestry, as, the, main, landscape, of, uruguay, is, grassland, 140, 000, km, 2, 87, of, the, national, territory, most, of, the, forestry, plantations, would, be, established, in, prairie, regions, the, planting, of, eucalyptus, sp, has, been, criticised, because, of, concerns, that, soil, would, be, degraded, by, nutrient, depletion, and, other, biological, changes, during, the, last, ten, years, in, the, northwestern, regions, of, uruguay, the, eucalyptus, sp, plantations, have, reached, annual, forestation, rates, of, 300, that, zone, has, a, potential, forested, area, of, 1, million, hectares, approximately, 29, of, the, national, territory, dedicated, to, forestry, of, which, approximately, 800, 000, hectares, are, currently, forested, by, monoculture, of, eucalyptus, spp, it, is, expected, that, the, radical, and, durable, substitution, of, vegetation, cover, leads, to, changes, in, the, quantity, and, quality, of, soil, organic, matter, such, changes, may, also, influence, soil, fertility, and, soil, physical, and, chemical, properties, the, soil, quality, effects, associated, with, eucalyptus, sp, plantations, could, have, adverse, effects, on, soil, chemistry, for, example, soil, acidification, iron, leaching, allelopathic, activities, and, a, high, c, n, ratio, of, litter, additionally, as, most, scientific, understanding, of, land, cover, change, effects, is, related, to, ecosystems, where, forests, were, replaced, by, grasslands, or, crops, or, grassland, was, replaced, by, crops, the, environmental, effects, of, the, current, uruguayan, land, cover, changes, are, not, well, understood, the, first, scientific, publication, on, soil, studies, in, western, zone, tree, plantations, focused, on, pulp, production, appeared, in, 2004, and, described, soil, acidification, and, soil, carbon, changes, similar, to, a, podzolisation, process, and, destruction, of, clay, illite, like, minerals, which, is, the, main, reservoir, of, potassium, in, the, soil, although, these, studies, were, carried, out, in, an, important, zone, for, forest, cultivation, they, cannot, define, the, current, situation, in, the, rest, of, the, land, area, under, eucalyptus, cultivation, moreover, recently, jackson, and, jobbagy, have, proposed, another, adverse, environmental, impact, that, may, result, from, eucalyptus, culture, on, prairie, soils, stream, acidification, the, eucalyptus, species, most, planted, are, e, grandis, e, globulus, and, e, dunnii, they, are, used, mainly, for, pulp, mills, approximately, 80, 000, ha, of, e, grandis, situated, in, the, departments, of, rivera, tacuaremb, and, paysand, is, primarily, earmarked, for, the, solid, wood, market, although, a, portion, of, it, is, used, for, sawlogs, and, plywood, the, current, area, under, commercial, forest, plantation, is, 6, of, the, total, the, main, uses, of, the, wood, produced, are, elemental, chlorine, free, pulp, mill, production, for, cellulose, and, paper, sawlogs, plywood, and, bioenergy, thermoelectric, generation, most, of, the, products, obtained, from, sawmills, and, pulp, mills, as, well, as, plywood, and, logs, are, exported, this, has, raised, the, income, of, this, sector, with, respect, to, traditional, products, from, other, sectors, uruguayan, forestry, plantations, have, rates, of, growth, of, 30, cubic, metres, per, hectare, per, year, and, commercial, harvesting, occurs, after, nine, years, eucalypts, were, introduced, to, brazil, in, 1910, for, timber, substitution, and, the, charcoal, industry, it, has, thrived, in, the, local, environment, and, today, there, are, around, 7, million, hectares, planted, the, wood, is, highly, valued, by, the, charcoal, and, pulp, and, paper, industries, the, short, rotation, allows, a, larger, wood, production, and, supplies, wood, for, several, other, activities, helping, to, preserve, the, native, forests, from, logging, when, well, managed, the, plantation, soils, can, sustain, endless, replanting, eucalyptus, plantings, are, also, used, as, wind, breaks, brazil, s, plantations, have, world, record, rates, of, growth, typically, over, 40, cubic, metres, per, hectare, per, year, and, commercial, harvesting, occurs, after, years, 5, due, to, continual, development, and, governmental, funding, year, on, year, growth, is, consistently, being, improved, eucalyptus, can, produce, up, to, 100, cubic, metres, per, hectare, per, year, brazil, has, become, the, top, exporter, and, producer, of, eucalyptus, round, wood, and, pulp, and, has, played, an, important, role, in, developing, the, australian, market, through, the, country, s, committed, research, in, this, area, the, local, iron, producers, in, brazil, rely, heavily, on, sustainably, grown, eucalyptus, for, charcoal, this, has, greatly, pushed, up, the, price, of, charcoal, in, recent, years, the, plantations, are, generally, owned, and, operated, for, national, and, international, industry, by, timber, asset, companies, such, as, thomson, forestry, greenwood, management, or, cellulose, producers, such, as, aracruz, cellulose, and, stora, enso, overall, south, america, was, expected, to, produce, 55, of, the, world, s, eucalyptus, round, wood, by, 2010, many, environmental, ngos, have, criticised, the, use, of, exotic, tree, species, for, forestry, in, latin, america, in, the, east, of, angola, the, benguela, railway, company, created, eucalyptus, plantations, for, firing, its, steam, locomotives, eucalypts, were, introduced, to, ethiopia, in, either, 1894, or, 1895, either, by, emperor, menelik, ii, s, french, advisor, mondon, vidailhet, or, by, the, englishman, captain, o, brian, menelik, ii, endorsed, its, planting, around, his, new, capital, city, of, addis, ababa, because, of, the, massive, deforestation, around, the, city, for, firewood, according, to, richard, r, k, pankhurst, the, great, advantage, of, the, eucalypts, was, that, they, were, fast, growing, required, little, attention, and, when, cut, down, grew, up, again, from, the, roots, it, could, be, harvested, every, ten, years, the, tree, proved, successful, from, the, onset, plantations, of, eucalypts, spread, from, the, capital, to, other, growing, urban, centres, such, as, debre, marqos, pankhurst, reports, that, the, most, common, species, found, in, addis, ababa, in, the, mid, 1960s, was, e, globulus, although, he, also, found, e, melliodora, and, e, rostrata, in, significant, numbers, david, buxton, writing, of, central, ethiopia, in, the, mid, 1940s, observed, that, eucalyptus, trees, have, become, an, integral, and, a, pleasing, element, in, the, shoan, landscape, and, has, largely, displaced, the, slow, growing, native, cedar, juniperus, procera, it, was, commonly, believed, that, the, thirst, of, the, eucalyptus, tended, to, dry, up, rivers, and, wells, creating, such, opposition, to, the, species, that, in, 1913, a, proclamation, was, issued, ordering, a, partial, destruction, of, all, standing, trees, and, their, replacement, with, mulberry, trees, pankhurst, reports, the, proclamation, however, remained, a, dead, letter, there, is, no, evidence, of, eucalypts, being, uprooted, still, less, of, mulberry, trees, being, planted, eucalypts, remain, a, defining, feature, of, addis, ababa, much, of, madagascar, s, original, native, forest, has, been, replaced, with, eucalyptus, threatening, biodiversity, by, isolating, remaining, natural, areas, such, as, andasibe, mantadia, national, park, numerous, eucalyptus, species, have, been, introduced, into, south, africa, mainly, for, timber, and, firewood, but, also, for, ornamental, purposes, they, are, popular, with, beekeepers, for, the, honey, they, provide, however, in, south, africa, they, are, considered, invasive, with, their, water, sucking, capabilities, threatening, water, supplies, they, also, release, a, chemical, into, the, surrounding, soil, which, kills, native, competitors, eucalyptus, seedlings, are, usually, unable, to, compete, with, the, indigenous, grasses, but, after, a, fire, when, the, grass, cover, has, been, removed, a, seed, bed, may, be, created, the, following, eucalyptus, species, have, been, able, to, become, naturalised, in, south, africa, e, camaldulensis, e, cladocalyx, e, diversicolor, e, grandis, and, e, lehmannii, as, in, south, africa, many, eucalyptus, species, have, been, introduced, into, zimbabwe, mainly, for, timber, and, firewood, and, e, robusta, and, e, tereticornis, have, been, recorded, as, having, become, naturalised, there, eucalypts, have, been, grown, in, portugal, since, the, mid, 19th, century, the, first, thought, to, be, a, specimen, of, e, obliqua, introduced, to, vila, nova, de, gaia, in, 1829, first, as, an, ornamental, but, soon, after, in, plantations, these, eucalypts, are, prized, due, to, their, long, and, upright, trunks, rapid, growth, and, the, ability, to, regrow, after, cutting, these, plantations, now, occupy, around, 800, 000, hectares, 10, of, the, country, s, total, land, area, 90, of, the, trees, being, e, globulus, as, of, the, late, 20th, century, there, were, an, estimated, 120, species, of, eucalyptus, in, portugal, the, genus, has, also, been, subject, to, various, controversies, despite, representing, a, large, part, of, the, agricultural, economy, eucalypt, plantations, have, a, negative, impact, on, soil, destruction, inducing, resistance, to, water, infiltration, and, increasing, the, risks, of, erosion, and, soil, loss, they, are, highly, inflammable, aggravating, the, risk, for, wildfires, various, portuguese, laws, on, eucalypt, plantations, have, been, formed, and, reformed, to, better, suit, both, sides, there, are, various, eucalyptus, species, of, public, interest, in, portugal, namely, a, karri, in, coimbra, s, mata, nacional, de, vale, de, canas, considered, to, be, europe, s, tallest, tree, at, 72, m, 236, ft, high, in, italy, the, eucalyptus, only, arrived, at, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, and, large, scale, plantations, were, started, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, with, the, aim, of, drying, up, swampy, ground, to, defeat, malaria, during, the, 1930s, benito, mussolini, had, thousands, of, eucalyptus, planted, in, the, marshes, around, rome, this, their, rapid, growth, in, the, italian, climate, and, excellent, function, as, windbreaks, has, made, them, a, common, sight, in, the, south, of, the, country, including, the, islands, of, sardinia, and, sicily, they, are, also, valued, for, the, characteristic, smelling, and, tasting, honey, that, is, produced, from, them, the, variety, of, eucalyptus, most, commonly, found, in, italy, is, e, camaldulensis, in, greece, eucalypts, are, widely, found, especially, in, southern, greece, and, crete, they, are, cultivated, and, used, for, various, purposes, including, as, an, ingredient, in, pharmaceutical, products, e, g, creams, elixirs, and, sprays, and, for, leather, production, they, were, imported, in, 1862, by, botanist, theodoros, georgios, orphanides, the, principal, species, is, e, globulus, eucalyptus, has, been, grown, in, ireland, since, trials, in, the, 1930s, and, now, grows, wild, in, south, western, ireland, in, the, mild, climate, eucalyptus, seeds, of, the, species, e, globulus, were, imported, into, palestine, in, the, 1860s, but, did, not, acclimatise, well, later, e, camaldulensis, was, introduced, more, successfully, and, it, is, still, a, very, common, tree, in, israel, the, use, of, eucalyptus, trees, to, drain, swampy, land, was, a, common, practice, in, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, the, german, templer, colony, of, sarona, had, begun, planting, eucalyptus, for, this, purpose, by, 1874, though, it, is, not, known, where, the, seeds, came, from, many, zionist, colonies, also, adopted, the, practice, in, the, following, years, under, the, guidance, of, the, mikveh, israel, agricultural, school, eucalyptus, trees, are, now, considered, an, invasive, species, in, the, region, in, india, the, institute, of, forest, genetics, and, tree, breeding, coimbatore, started, a, eucalyptus, breeding, program, in, the, 1990s, the, organisation, released, four, varieties, of, conventionally, bred, high, yielding, and, genetically, improved, clones, for, commercial, and, research, interests, in, 2010, eucalyptus, trees, were, introduced, to, sri, lanka, in, the, late, 19th, century, by, tea, and, coffee, planters, for, wind, protection, shade, and, fuel, forestry, replanting, of, eucalyptus, began, in, the, 1930s, in, deforested, mountain, areas, and, currently, there, are, about, 10, species, present, in, the, island, they, account, for, 20, of, major, reforestation, plantings, they, provide, railway, sleepers, utility, poles, sawn, timber, and, fuelwood, but, are, controversial, because, of, their, adverse, effect, on, biodiversity, hydrology, and, soil, fertility, they, are, associated, with, another, invasive, species, the, eucalyptus, gall, wasp, leptocybe, invasa, in, hawaii, some, 90, species, of, eucalyptus, have, been, introduced, to, the, islands, where, they, have, displaced, some, native, species, due, to, their, higher, maximum, height, fast, growth, and, lower, water, needs, particularly, noticeable, is, the, rainbow, eucalyptus, eucalyptus, deglupta, native, to, indonesia, and, the, philippines, whose, bark, falls, off, to, reveal, a, trunk, that, can, be, green, red, orange, yellow, pink, and, purple, due, to, similar, favourable, climatic, conditions, eucalyptus, plantations, have, often, replaced, oak, woodlands, for, example, in, california, spain, and, portugal, the, resulting, monocultures, have, raised, concerns, about, loss, of, biological, diversity, through, loss, of, acorns, that, mammals, and, birds, feed, on, absence, of, hollows, that, in, oak, trees, provide, shelter, and, nesting, sites, for, birds, and, small, mammals, and, for, bee, colonies, as, well, as, lack, of, downed, trees, in, managed, plantations, a, study, of, the, relationship, between, birds, and, eucalyptus, in, the, san, francisco, bay, area, found, that, bird, diversity, was, similar, in, native, forest, versus, eucalyptus, forest, but, the, species, were, different, one, way, in, which, the, avifauna, local, assortment, of, bird, species, changes, is, that, cavity, nesting, birds, including, woodpeckers, owls, chickadees, wood, ducks, etc, are, depauperate, in, eucalyptus, groves, because, the, decay, resistant, wood, of, these, trees, prevents, cavity, formation, by, decay, or, excavation, also, those, bird, species, that, glean, insects, from, foliage, such, as, warblers, and, vireos, experience, population, declines, when, eucalyptus, groves, replace, oak, forest, birds, that, thrive, in, eucalyptus, groves, in, california, tend, to, prefer, tall, vertical, habitat, these, avian, species, include, herons, and, egrets, which, also, nest, in, redwoods, the, point, reyes, bird, observatory, observes, that, sometimes, short, billed, birds, like, the, ruby, crowned, kinglet, are, found, dead, beneath, eucalyptus, trees, with, their, nostrils, clogged, with, pitch, monarch, butterflies, use, eucalyptus, in, california, for, overwintering, but, in, some, locations, have, a, preference, for, monterey, pines, eucalyptus, trees, are, considered, invasive, to, local, ecosystems, and, negatively, impact, water, resources, in, countries, where, they, are, introduced, south, africa, in, south, africa, eucalyptus, tree, species, e, camaldulensis, e, cladocalyx, e, conferruminata, e, diversicolor, e, grandis, and, e, tereticornis, are, listed, as, category, 1b, invaders, in, the, national, environmental, management, biodiversity, act, this, means, most, activities, with, regards, to, the, species, are, prohibited, such, as, importing, propagating, translocating, or, trading, and, it, should, be, ensured, that, it, does, not, spread, beyond, a, plantation, s, domain, e, cladocalyx, and, e, diversicolor, are, considered, fynbos, invaders, and, use, up, to, 20, more, water, than, the, native, fynbos, vegetation, with, invasive, species, including, eucalyptus, being, cleared, that, reduce, cape, town, s, water, resource, by, 55, billion, litres, or, two, months, worth, of, water, supply
