c, p, bellii, c, p, marginata, c, p, picta, orange, midland, c, p, marginata, blue, southern, c, dorsalis, red, western, c, p, bellii, the, painted, turtle, chrysemys, picta, is, the, most, widespread, native, turtle, of, north, america, it, lives, in, relatively, slow, moving, fresh, waters, from, southern, canada, to, northern, mexico, and, from, the, atlantic, to, the, pacific, they, have, been, shown, to, prefer, large, wetlands, with, long, periods, of, inundation, and, emergent, vegetation, this, species, is, one, of, the, few, that, is, specially, adapted, to, tolerate, freezing, temperatures, for, extended, periods, of, time, due, to, an, antifreeze, like, substance, in, their, blood, that, keeps, their, cells, from, freezing, this, turtle, is, a, member, of, the, genus, chrysemys, which, is, part, of, the, pond, turtle, family, emydidae, fossils, show, that, the, painted, turtle, existed, 15, million, years, ago, three, regionally, based, subspecies, the, eastern, midland, and, western, evolved, during, the, last, ice, age, the, southern, painted, turtle, c, dorsalis, is, alternately, considered, the, only, other, species, in, chrysemys, or, another, subspecies, of, c, picta, the, adult, painted, turtle, is, 13, 25, cm, 5, 10, in, long, the, male, is, smaller, than, the, female, the, turtle, s, top, shell, is, dark, and, smooth, without, a, ridge, its, skin, is, olive, to, black, with, red, orange, or, yellow, stripes, on, its, extremities, the, subspecies, can, be, distinguished, by, their, shells, the, eastern, has, straight, aligned, top, shell, segments, the, midland, has, a, large, gray, mark, on, the, bottom, shell, the, western, has, a, red, pattern, on, the, bottom, shell, the, turtle, eats, aquatic, vegetation, algae, and, small, water, creatures, including, insects, crustaceans, and, fish, painted, turtles, primarily, feed, while, in, water, and, are, able, to, locate, and, subdue, prey, even, in, heavily, clouded, conditions, although, they, are, frequently, consumed, as, eggs, or, hatchlings, by, rodents, canines, and, snakes, the, adult, turtles, hard, shells, protect, them, from, most, predators, reliant, on, warmth, from, its, surroundings, the, painted, turtle, is, active, only, during, the, day, when, it, basks, for, hours, on, logs, or, rocks, during, winter, the, turtle, hibernates, usually, in, the, mud, at, the, bottom, of, water, bodies, the, turtles, mate, in, spring, and, autumn, females, dig, nests, on, land, and, lay, eggs, between, late, spring, and, mid, summer, hatched, turtles, grow, until, sexual, maturity, 2, 9, years, for, males, 6, 16, for, females, in, the, traditional, tales, of, algonquian, tribes, the, colorful, turtle, played, the, part, of, a, trickster, in, modern, times, four, u, s, states, colorado, illinois, michigan, and, vermont, have, named, the, painted, turtle, their, official, reptile, while, habitat, loss, and, road, killings, have, reduced, the, turtle, s, population, its, ability, to, live, in, human, disturbed, settings, has, helped, it, remain, the, most, abundant, turtle, in, north, america, adults, in, the, wild, can, live, for, more, than, 55, years, the, painted, turtle, c, picta, is, the, only, species, in, the, genus, chrysemys, the, parent, family, for, chrysemys, is, emydidae, the, pond, turtles, emydidae, is, split, into, two, sub, families, chrysemys, is, part, of, the, deirochelyinae, western, hemisphere, branch, the, four, subspecies, of, the, painted, turtle, are, the, eastern, c, p, picta, midland, c, p, marginata, southern, c, p, dorsalis, and, western, c, p, bellii, the, painted, turtle, s, generic, name, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, words, for, gold, chryso, and, freshwater, tortoise, emys, the, species, name, originates, from, the, latin, for, colored, pictus, the, subspecies, name, marginata, derives, from, the, latin, for, border, and, refers, to, the, red, markings, on, the, outer, marginal, part, of, the, upper, shell, dorsalis, is, from, the, latin, for, back, referring, to, the, prominent, dorsal, stripe, and, bellii, honors, english, zoologist, thomas, bell, a, collaborator, of, charles, darwin, an, alternate, east, coast, common, name, for, the, painted, turtle, is, skilpot, from, the, dutch, for, turtle, schildpad, originally, described, in, 1783, by, johann, gottlob, schneider, as, testudo, picta, the, painted, turtle, was, called, chrysemys, picta, first, by, john, edward, gray, in, 1855, four, subspecies, were, then, recognized, the, eastern, by, schneider, in, 1783, the, western, by, gray, in, 1831, and, the, midland, and, southern, by, louis, agassiz, in, 1857, though, the, southern, painted, turtle, is, now, generally, considered, a, full, species, although, the, subspecies, of, painted, turtle, intergrade, blend, together, at, range, boundaries, they, are, distinct, within, the, hearts, of, their, ranges, until, the, 1930s, many, of, the, subspecies, of, the, painted, turtle, were, labeled, by, biologists, as, full, species, within, chrysemys, but, this, varied, by, the, researcher, the, painted, turtles, in, the, border, region, between, the, western, and, midland, subspecies, were, sometimes, considered, a, full, species, treleasei, in, 1931, bishop, and, schmidt, defined, the, current, four, in, one, taxonomy, of, species, and, subspecies, based, on, comparative, measurements, of, turtles, from, throughout, the, range, they, subordinated, species, to, subspecies, and, eliminated, treleasei, since, at, least, 1958, the, subspecies, were, thought, to, have, evolved, in, response, to, geographic, isolation, during, the, last, ice, age, 100, 000, to, 11, 000, years, ago, at, that, time, painted, turtles, were, divided, into, three, different, populations, eastern, painted, turtles, along, the, southeastern, atlantic, coast, southern, painted, turtles, around, the, southern, mississippi, river, and, western, painted, turtles, in, the, southwestern, united, states, the, populations, were, not, completely, isolated, for, sufficiently, long, hence, wholly, different, species, never, evolved, when, the, glaciers, retreated, about, 11, 000, years, ago, all, three, subspecies, moved, north, the, western, and, southern, subspecies, met, in, missouri, and, hybridized, to, produce, the, midland, painted, turtle, which, then, moved, east, and, north, through, the, ohio, and, tennessee, river, basins, biologists, have, long, debated, the, genera, of, closely, related, subfamily, mates, chrysemys, pseudemys, cooters, and, trachemys, sliders, after, 1952, some, combined, pseudemys, and, chrysemys, because, of, similar, appearance, in, 1964, based, on, measurements, of, the, skull, and, feet, samuel, b, mcdowell, proposed, all, three, genera, be, merged, into, one, however, further, measurements, in, 1967, contradicted, this, taxonomic, arrangement, also, in, 1967, j, alan, holman, a, paleontologist, and, herpetologist, pointed, out, that, although, the, three, turtles, were, often, found, together, in, nature, and, had, similar, mating, patterns, they, did, not, crossbreed, in, the, 1980s, studies, of, turtles, cell, structures, biochemistries, and, parasites, further, indicated, that, chrysemys, pseudemys, and, trachemys, should, remain, in, separate, genera, in, 2003, starkey, et, al, proposed, that, chrysemys, dorsalis, formerly, considered, a, subspecies, of, c, picta, to, be, a, distinct, species, sister, to, all, subspecies, in, c, picta, although, this, proposal, was, largely, unrecognized, at, the, time, due, to, evidence, of, hybridization, between, dorsalis, and, picta, the, turtle, taxonomy, working, group, and, the, reptile, database, have, since, followed, through, with, it, although, both, the, subspecific, and, specific, names, have, been, recognized, although, its, evolutionary, history, what, the, forerunner, to, the, species, was, and, how, the, close, relatives, branched, off, is, not, well, understood, the, painted, turtle, is, common, in, the, fossil, record, the, oldest, samples, found, in, nebraska, date, to, about, 15, million, years, ago, fossils, from, 15, million, to, about, 5, million, years, ago, are, restricted, to, the, nebraska, kansas, area, but, more, recent, fossils, are, gradually, more, widely, distributed, fossils, newer, than, 300, 000, years, old, are, found, in, almost, all, the, united, states, and, southern, canada, the, turtle, s, karyotype, nuclear, dna, rather, than, mitochondrial, dna, consists, of, 50, chromosomes, the, same, number, as, the, rest, of, its, subfamily, mates, and, the, most, common, number, for, emydidae, turtles, in, general, less, well, related, turtles, have, from, 26, to, 66, chromosomes, little, systematic, study, of, variations, of, the, painted, turtle, s, karotype, among, populations, has, been, done, however, in, 1967, research, on, protein, structure, of, offshore, island, populations, in, new, england, showed, differences, from, mainland, turtles, comparison, of, subspecies, chromosomal, dna, has, been, discussed, to, help, address, the, debate, over, starkey, s, proposed, taxonomy, but, as, of, 2009, had, not, been, reported, the, complete, sequencing, of, the, genetic, code, for, the, painted, turtle, was, at, a, draft, assembled, state, in, 2010, the, turtle, was, one, of, two, reptiles, chosen, to, be, first, sequenced, adult, painted, turtles, can, grow, to, 13, 25, cm, 5, 10, in, long, with, males, being, smaller, the, shell, is, oval, smooth, with, little, grooves, where, the, large, scale, like, plates, overlap, and, flat, bottomed, the, color, of, the, top, shell, carapace, varies, from, olive, to, black, darker, specimens, are, more, common, where, the, bottom, of, the, water, body, is, darker, the, bottom, shell, plastron, is, yellow, sometimes, red, sometimes, with, dark, markings, in, the, center, similar, to, the, top, shell, the, turtle, s, skin, is, olive, to, black, but, with, red, and, yellow, stripes, on, its, neck, legs, and, tail, as, with, other, pond, turtles, such, as, the, bog, turtle, the, painted, turtle, s, feet, are, webbed, to, aid, swimming, the, head, of, the, turtle, is, distinctive, the, face, has, only, yellow, stripes, with, a, large, yellow, spot, and, streak, behind, each, eye, and, on, the, chin, two, wide, yellow, stripes, that, meet, at, the, tip, of, the, jaw, the, turtle, s, upper, jaw, is, shaped, into, an, inverted, v, philtrum, with, a, downward, facing, tooth, like, projection, on, each, side, the, hatchling, has, a, proportionally, larger, head, eyes, and, tail, and, a, more, circular, shell, than, the, adult, the, adult, female, is, generally, longer, than, the, male, 10, 25, cm, 4, 10, in, versus, 7, 15, cm, 3, 6, in, for, a, given, length, the, female, has, a, higher, more, rounded, less, flat, top, shell, the, female, weighs, around, 500, g, 18, oz, on, average, against, the, males, average, adult, weight, of, roughly, 300, g, 11, oz, the, female, s, greater, body, volume, supports, her, egg, production, the, male, has, longer, foreclaws, and, a, longer, thicker, tail, with, the, anus, cloaca, located, further, out, on, the, tail, the, painted, turtle, has, a, very, similar, appearance, to, the, red, eared, slider, the, most, common, pet, turtle, and, the, two, are, often, confused, the, painted, turtle, can, be, distinguished, because, it, is, flatter, than, the, slider, also, the, slider, has, a, prominent, red, marking, on, the, side, of, its, head, the, ear, and, a, spotted, bottom, shell, both, features, missing, in, the, painted, turtle, the, most, widespread, north, american, turtle, the, painted, turtle, is, the, only, turtle, whose, native, range, extends, from, the, atlantic, to, the, pacific, it, is, native, to, eight, of, canada, s, ten, provinces, forty, five, of, the, fifty, united, states, and, one, of, mexico, s, thirty, one, states, on, the, east, coast, it, lives, from, the, canadian, maritimes, to, the, u, s, state, of, georgia, on, the, west, coast, it, lives, in, british, columbia, washington, and, oregon, and, offshore, on, southeast, vancouver, island, the, northernmost, american, turtle, its, range, includes, much, of, southern, canada, to, the, south, its, range, reaches, the, u, s, gulf, coast, in, louisiana, and, alabama, in, the, southwestern, united, states, there, are, only, dispersed, populations, it, is, found, in, one, river, in, extreme, northern, mexico, it, is, absent, in, a, part, of, southwestern, virginia, and, the, adjacent, states, as, well, as, in, north, central, alabama, there, is, a, harsher, divide, between, midland, and, eastern, painted, turtles, in, the, southeast, because, they, are, separated, by, the, appalachian, mountains, but, the, two, subspecies, tend, to, mix, in, the, northeast, the, borders, between, the, four, subspecies, are, not, sharp, because, the, subspecies, interbreed, many, studies, have, been, performed, in, the, border, regions, to, assess, the, intermediate, turtles, usually, by, comparing, the, anatomical, features, of, hybrids, that, result, from, intergradation, of, the, classical, subspecies, despite, the, imprecision, the, subspecies, are, assigned, nominal, ranges, the, eastern, painted, turtle, ranges, from, southeastern, canada, to, georgia, with, a, western, boundary, at, approximately, the, appalachians, at, its, northern, extremes, the, turtle, tends, to, be, restricted, to, the, warmer, areas, closer, to, the, atlantic, ocean, it, is, uncommon, in, far, north, new, hampshire, and, in, maine, is, common, only, in, a, strip, about, 50, miles, from, the, coast, in, canada, it, lives, in, new, brunswick, and, nova, scotia, but, not, in, quebec, or, prince, edward, island, to, the, south, it, is, not, found, in, the, coastal, lowlands, of, southern, north, carolina, south, carolina, or, georgia, or, in, southern, georgia, in, general, or, at, all, in, florida, in, the, northeast, there, is, extensive, mixing, with, the, midland, subspecies, and, some, writers, have, called, these, turtles, a, hybrid, swarm, in, the, southeast, the, border, between, the, eastern, and, midland, is, more, sharp, as, mountain, chains, separate, the, subspecies, to, different, drainage, basins, the, midland, painted, turtle, lives, from, southern, ontario, and, quebec, through, the, eastern, u, s, midwest, states, to, kentucky, tennessee, and, northwestern, alabama, where, it, intergrades, with, the, southern, painted, turtle, it, also, is, found, eastward, through, west, virginia, western, maryland, and, pennsylvania, the, midland, painted, turtle, appears, to, be, moving, east, especially, in, pennsylvania, to, the, northeast, it, is, found, in, western, new, york, and, much, of, vermont, and, it, intergrades, extensively, with, the, eastern, subspecies, the, western, painted, turtle, s, northern, range, includes, southern, parts, of, western, canada, from, ontario, through, manitoba, saskatchewan, alberta, and, british, columbia, in, ontario, the, western, subspecies, is, found, north, of, minnesota, and, directly, north, of, lake, superior, but, there, is, a, 130, km, 80, mi, gap, to, the, east, of, lake, superior, in, the, area, of, harshest, winter, climate, where, no, painted, turtles, of, any, subspecies, occur, thus, ontario, s, western, subspecies, does, not, intergrade, with, the, midland, painted, turtle, of, southeastern, ontario, in, manitoba, the, turtle, is, numerous, and, ranges, north, to, lake, manitoba, and, the, lower, part, of, lake, winnipeg, the, turtle, is, also, common, in, south, saskatchewan, but, in, alberta, there, may, only, be, 100, individuals, all, found, very, near, the, u, s, border, mostly, in, the, southeast, in, british, columbia, populations, exist, in, the, interior, in, the, vicinity, of, the, kootenai, columbia, okanagan, and, thompson, river, valleys, at, the, coast, turtles, occur, near, the, mouth, of, the, fraser, and, a, bit, further, north, as, well, as, the, bottom, of, vancouver, island, and, some, other, nearby, islands, within, british, columbia, the, turtle, s, range, is, not, continuous, and, can, better, be, understood, as, northward, extensions, of, the, range, from, the, united, states, high, mountains, present, barriers, to, east, west, movement, of, the, turtles, within, the, province, or, from, alberta, some, literature, has, shown, isolated, populations, much, further, north, in, british, columbia, and, alberta, but, these, were, probably, pet, releases, in, the, united, states, the, western, subspecies, forms, a, wide, intergrade, area, with, the, midland, subspecies, covering, much, of, illinois, as, well, as, a, strip, of, wisconsin, along, lake, michigan, and, part, of, the, upper, peninsula, of, michigan, up, further, west, the, rest, of, illinois, wisconsin, and, the, up, are, part, of, the, range, proper, as, are, all, of, minnesota, and, iowa, as, well, as, all, of, missouri, except, a, narrow, strip, in, the, south, all, of, north, dakota, is, within, range, all, of, south, dakota, except, a, very, small, area, in, the, west, and, all, of, nebraska, almost, all, of, kansas, is, in, range, the, border, of, that, state, with, oklahoma, is, roughly, the, species, range, border, but, the, turtle, is, found, in, three, counties, of, north, central, oklahoma, to, the, northwest, almost, all, of, montana, is, in, range, only, a, narrow, strip, in, the, west, along, most, of, the, idaho, border, which, is, at, the, continental, divide, lacks, turtles, wyoming, is, almost, entirely, out, of, range, only, the, lower, elevation, areas, near, the, eastern, and, northern, borders, have, painted, turtles, in, idaho, the, turtles, are, found, throughout, the, far, north, upper, half, of, the, idaho, panhandle, recently, separate, idaho, populations, have, been, observed, in, the, southwest, near, the, payette, and, boise, rivers, and, the, southeast, near, st, anthony, in, washington, state, turtles, are, common, throughout, the, state, within, lower, elevation, river, valleys, in, oregon, the, turtle, is, native, to, the, northern, part, of, the, state, throughout, the, columbia, river, valley, as, well, as, the, willamette, river, valley, north, of, salem, to, the, southwest, the, painted, turtle, s, range, is, fragmented, in, colorado, while, range, is, continuous, in, the, eastern, prairie, half, of, the, state, it, is, absent, in, most, of, the, western, mountainous, part, of, the, state, however, the, turtle, is, confirmed, present, in, the, lower, elevation, southwest, part, of, the, state, archuleta, and, la, plata, counties, where, a, population, ranges, into, northern, new, mexico, in, the, san, juan, river, basin, in, new, mexico, the, main, distribution, follows, the, rio, grande, and, the, pecos, river, two, waterways, that, run, in, a, north, south, direction, through, the, state, within, the, aforementioned, rivers, it, is, also, found, in, the, northern, part, of, far, west, texas, in, utah, the, painted, turtle, lives, in, an, area, to, the, south, kane, county, in, streams, draining, into, the, colorado, river, although, it, is, disputed, if, they, are, native, in, arizona, the, painted, turtle, is, native, to, an, area, in, the, east, lyman, lake, the, painted, turtle, is, not, native, to, nevada, or, california, in, mexico, painted, turtles, have, been, found, about, 50, miles, south, of, new, mexico, near, galeana, in, the, state, of, chihuahua, there, two, expeditions, found, the, turtles, in, the, rio, santa, maria, which, is, in, a, closed, basin, pet, releases, are, starting, to, establish, the, painted, turtle, outside, its, native, range, it, has, been, introduced, into, waterways, near, phoenix, arizona, and, to, germany, indonesia, the, philippines, and, spain, to, thrive, painted, turtles, need, fresh, waters, with, soft, bottoms, basking, sites, and, aquatic, vegetation, they, find, their, homes, in, shallow, waters, with, slow, moving, currents, such, as, creeks, marshes, ponds, and, the, shores, of, lakes, the, subspecies, have, evolved, different, habitat, preferences, within, much, of, its, range, the, painted, turtle, is, the, most, abundant, turtle, species, population, densities, range, from, 10, to, 840, turtles, per, hectare, 2, 5, acres, of, water, surface, warmer, climates, produce, higher, relative, densities, among, populations, and, habitat, desirability, also, influences, density, rivers, and, large, lakes, have, lower, densities, because, only, the, shore, is, desirable, habitat, the, central, deep, waters, skew, the, surface, based, estimates, also, lake, and, river, turtles, have, to, make, longer, linear, trips, to, access, equivalent, amounts, of, foraging, space, adults, outnumber, juveniles, in, most, populations, but, gauging, the, ratios, is, difficult, because, juveniles, are, harder, to, catch, with, current, sampling, methods, estimates, of, age, distribution, vary, widely, annual, survival, rate, of, painted, turtles, increases, with, age, the, probability, of, a, painted, turtle, surviving, from, the, egg, to, its, first, birthday, is, only, 19, for, females, the, annual, survival, rate, rises, to, 45, for, juveniles, and, 95, for, adults, the, male, survival, rates, follow, a, similar, pattern, but, are, probably, lower, overall, than, females, as, evidenced, by, the, average, male, age, being, lower, than, that, of, the, female, natural, disasters, can, confound, age, distributions, for, instance, a, hurricane, can, destroy, many, nests, in, a, region, resulting, in, fewer, hatchlings, the, next, year, age, distributions, may, also, be, skewed, by, migrations, of, adults, to, understand, painted, turtle, adult, age, distributions, researchers, require, reliable, methods, turtles, younger, than, four, years, up, to, 12, years, in, some, populations, can, be, aged, based, on, growth, rings, in, their, shells, for, older, turtles, some, attempts, have, been, made, to, determine, age, based, on, size, and, shape, of, their, shells, or, legs, using, mathematical, models, but, this, method, is, more, uncertain, the, most, reliable, method, to, study, the, long, lived, turtles, is, to, capture, them, permanently, mark, their, shells, by, notching, with, a, drill, release, the, turtles, and, then, recapture, them, in, later, years, the, longest, running, study, in, michigan, has, shown, that, painted, turtles, can, live, more, than, 55, years, adult, sex, ratios, of, painted, turtle, populations, average, around, 1, 1, many, populations, are, slightly, male, heavy, but, some, are, strongly, female, imbalanced, one, population, in, ontario, has, a, female, to, male, ratio, of, 4, 1, hatchling, sex, ratio, varies, based, on, egg, temperature, during, the, middle, third, of, incubation, temperatures, of, 23, 27, c, 73, 81, f, produce, males, and, anything, above, or, below, that, females, it, does, not, appear, that, females, choose, nesting, sites, to, influence, the, sex, of, the, hatchlings, within, a, population, nests, will, vary, sufficiently, to, give, both, male, and, female, heavy, broods, the, painted, turtle, is, a, bottom, dwelling, hunter, it, quickly, juts, its, head, into, and, out, of, vegetation, to, stir, potential, victims, out, into, the, open, water, where, they, are, pursued, large, prey, is, ripped, apart, with, the, forefeet, as, the, turtle, holds, it, in, its, mouth, it, also, consumes, plants, and, skims, the, surface, of, the, water, with, its, mouth, open, to, catch, small, particles, of, food, although, all, subspecies, of, painted, turtle, eat, both, plants, and, animals, in, the, form, of, leaves, algae, fish, crustaceans, aquatic, insects, and, carrion, their, specific, diets, vary, young, painted, turtles, are, mostly, carnivorous, and, as, they, mature, they, become, more, herbivorous, painted, turtles, obtain, coloration, from, carotenoids, in, their, natural, diet, by, eating, algae, and, a, variety, of, aquatic, plants, from, their, environment, stripes, and, spots, increase, red, and, yellow, chroma, and, decrease, uv, chroma, and, brightness, in, turtles, with, large, amounts, of, carotenoids, in, their, diet, compared, to, the, stripes, and, spots, of, turtles, with, only, moderate, amounts, of, carotenoids, in, their, diet, painted, turtles, are, most, vulnerable, to, predators, when, young, nests, are, frequently, ransacked, and, the, eggs, eaten, by, garter, snakes, crows, chipmunks, thirteen, lined, ground, and, gray, squirrels, skunks, groundhogs, raccoons, badgers, gray, and, red, fox, and, humans, the, small, and, sometimes, bite, size, numerous, hatchlings, fall, prey, to,

three, weeks, to, nest, because, of, a, hot, drought, while, preparing, to, dig, her, nest, the, female, sometimes, exhibits, a, mysterious, preliminary, behavior, she, presses, her, throat, against, the, ground, of, different, potential, sites, perhaps, sensing, moisture, warmth, texture, or, smell, although, her, exact, motivation, is, unknown, she, may, further, temporize, by, excavating, several, false, nests, as, the, wood, turtles, also, do, the, female, relies, on, her, hind, feet, for, digging, she, may, accumulate, so, much, sand, and, mud, on, her, feet, that, her, mobility, is, reduced, making, her, vulnerable, to, predators, to, lighten, her, labors, she, lubricates, the, area, with, her, bladder, water, once, the, nest, is, complete, the, female, deposits, into, the, hole,

eggs, per, clutch, clutch, sizes, of, the, subspecies, vary, although, the, differences, may, reflect, different, environments, rather, than, different, genetics, the, two, more, northerly, subspecies, western, and, midland, are, larger, and, have, more, eggs, per, clutch, 11, 9, and, 7, 6, respectively, than, the, eastern, 4, 9, within, subspecies, also, the, more, northerly, females, lay, larger, clutches, incubation, lasts, 72, 80, days, in, the, wild, and, for, a, similar, period, in, artificial, conditions, in, august, and, september, the, young, turtle, breaks, out, from, its, egg, using, a, special, projection, of, its, jaw, called, the, egg, tooth, not, all, offspring, leave, the, nest, immediately, though, hatchlings, north, of, a, line, from, nebraska, to, northern, illinois, to, new, jersey, typically, arrange, themselves, symmetrically, in, the, nest, and, overwinter, to, emerge, the, following, spring, the, hatchling, s, ability, to, survive, winter, in, the, nest, has, allowed, the, painted, turtle, to, extend, its, range, farther, north, than, any, other, american, turtle, the, painted, turtle, is, genetically, adapted, to, survive, extended, periods, of, subfreezing, temperatures, with, blood, that, can, remain, supercooled, and, skin, that, resists, penetration, from, ice, crystals, in, the, surrounding, ground, the, hardest, freezes, nevertheless, kill, many, hatchlings, immediately, after, hatching, turtles, are, dependent, on, egg, yolk, material, for, sustenance, about, a, week, to, a, week, and, a, half, after, emerging, from,

in, the, first, year, growth, slows, sharply, at, sexual, maturity, and, may, stop, completely, likely, owing, to, differences, of, habitat, and, food, by, water, body, growth, rates, often, differ, from, population, to, population, in, the, same, area, among, the, subspecies, the, western, painted, turtles, are, the, quickest, growers, females, grow, faster, than, males, overall, and, must, be, larger, to, mature, sexually, in, most, populations, males, reach, sexual, maturity, at, 2, 4, years, old, and, females, at, 6, 10, size, and, age, at, maturity, increase, with, latitude, at, the, northern, edge, of, their, range, males, reach, sexual, maturity, at, 7, 9, years, of, age, and, females, at, 11, 16, a, cold, blooded, reptile, the, painted, turtle, regulates, its, temperature, through, its, environment, notably, by, basking, all, ages, bask, for, warmth, often, alongside, other, species, of, turtle, sometimes, more, than, 50, individuals, are, seen, on, one, log, together, turtles, bask, on, a, variety, of, objects, often, logs, but, have, even, been, seen, basking, on, top, of, common, loons, that, were, covering, eggs, the, turtle, starts, its, day, at, sunrise, emerging, from, the, water, to, bask, for, several, hours, warmed, for, activity, it, returns, to, the, water, to, forage, after, becoming, chilled, the, turtle, re, emerges, for, one, to, two, more, cycles, of, basking, and, feeding, at, night, the, turtle, drops, to, the, bottom, of, its, water, body, or, perches, on, an, underwater, object, and, sleeps, to, be, active, the, turtle, must, maintain, an, internal, body, temperature, between, 17, 23, c, 63, 73, f, when, fighting, infection, it, manipulates, its, temperature, up, to, 5, c, 8, f, higher, than, normal, in, the, spring, when, the, water, reaches, 15, 18, c, 59, 64, f, the, turtle, begins, actively, foraging, however, if, the, water, temperature, exceeds, 30, c, 86, f, the, turtle, will, not, feed, in, fall, the, turtle, stops, foraging, when, temperatures, drop, below, the, spring, set, point, during, the, winter, the, turtle, hibernates, in, the, north, the, inactive, season, may, be, as, long, as, from, october, to, march, while, the, southernmost, populations, may, not, hibernate, at, all, while, hibernating, the, body, temperature, of, the, painted, turtle, averages, 6, c, 43, f, periods, of, warm, weather, bring, the, turtle, out, of, hibernation, and, even, in, the, north, individuals, have, been, seen, basking, in, february, the, painted, turtle, hibernates, by, burying, itself, either, on, the, bottom, of, a, body, of, water, near, water, in, the, shore, bank, or, the, burrow, of, a, muskrat, or, in, woods, or, pastures, when, hibernating, underwater, the, turtle, prefers, shallow, depths, no, more, than, 2, m, 7, ft, within, the, mud, it, may, dig, down, an, additional, 1, m, 3, ft, in, this, state, the, turtle, does, not, breathe, although, if, surroundings, allow, it, may, get, some, oxygen, through, its, skin, the, species, is, one, of, the, best, studied, vertebrates, able, to, survive, long, periods, without, oxygen, adaptations, of, its, blood, chemistry, brain, heart, and, particularly, its, shell, allow, the, turtle, to, survive, extreme, lactic, acid, buildup, while, oxygen, deprived, during, the, winter, months, painted, turtles, become, ice, locked, and, spend, their, time, in, either, hypoxic, low, oxygen, or, anoxic, no, oxygen, regions, of, the, pond, or, lake, painted, turtles, essentially, hold, their, breath, until, the, following, spring, when, the, ice, melts, as, a, result, painted, turtles, rely, on, anaerobic, respiration, which, leads, to, the, production, of, lactic, acid, however, painted, turtles, can, tolerate, long, periods, of, anoxia, due, to, three, factors, a, depressed, metabolic, rate, large, glycogen, stores, in, the, liver, and, sequestering, lactate, in, the, shell, and, releasing, carbonate, buffers, to, the, extracellular, fluid, the, shell, of, an, adult, painted, turtle, has, the, largest, concentration, of, carbonate, content, recorded, among, animals, this, large, carbonate, content, helps, the, painted, turtle, buffer, the, accumulation, of, lactic, acid, during, anoxia, both, the, shell, and, skeleton, release, calcium, and, magnesium, carbonates, to, buffer, extracellular, lactic, acid, a, painted, turtle, can, also, sequester, 44, of, total, body, lactate, in, their, shell, despite, the, shell, s, large, buffering, contribution, it, does, not, experience, any, significant, decrease, in, mechanical, properties, under, natural, conditions, the, duration, of, anoxia, tolerance, varies, depending, on, the, sub, species, of, painted, turtle, the, western, painted, turtle, c, picta, bellii, can, survive, 170, days, of, anoxia, followed, by, the, midland, painted, turtle, c, picta, marginata, which, can, survive, 150, days, and, finally, the, eastern, painted, turtle, c, picta, picta, which, can, survive, 125, days, differences, in, anoxia, tolerance, are, partially, attributed, to, the, rate, of, lactate, production, and, buffering, capability, in, painted, turtles, furthermore, northern, populations, of, painted, turtles, have, a, higher, anoxia, tolerance, than, southern, populations, other, anoxia, tolerant, freshwater, turtles, include, the, southern, painted, turtle, chrysemys, dorsalis, which, can, survive, 75, 86, days, of, anoxia, the, snapping, turtle, chelydra, serpentina, which, can, survive, 100, days, under, anoxia, and, the, map, turtle, graptemys, geographica, which, can, survive, 50, days, of, anoxia, one, reason, for, the, difference, in, duration, between, more, anoxia, tolerant, species, and, less, anoxia, tolerant, species, is, the, turtle, s, ability, to, buffer, lactic, acid, accumulation, during, anoxia, unlike, adult, painted, turtles, hatchlings, can, survive, only, 40, days, but, still, exhibit, high, anoxia, tolerance, and, freeze, tolerance, compared, to, other, hatchling, species, 30, days, for, chelydra, serpentina, and, 15, days, for, graptemys, geographica, due, to, cold, winters, searching, for, water, food, or, mates, the, painted, turtles, travel, up, to, several, kilometers, at, a, time, during, summer, in, response, to, heat, and, water, clogging, vegetation, the, turtles, may, vacate, shallow, marshes, for, more, permanent, waters, short, overland, migrations, may, involve, hundreds, of, turtles, together, if, heat, and, drought, are, prolonged, the, turtles, will, bury, themselves, and, in, extreme, cases, die, foraging, turtles, frequently, cross, lakes, or, travel, linearly, down, creeks, daily, crossings, of, large, ponds, have, been, observed, tag, and, release, studies, show, that, sex, also, drives, turtle, movement, males, travel, the, most, up, to, 26, km, 16, mi, between, captures, females, the, second, most, up, to, 8, km, 5, mi, between, captures, and, juveniles, the, least, less, than, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, between, captures, males, move, the, most, and, are, most, likely, to, change, wetlands, because, they, seek, mates, the, painted, turtles, through, visual, recognition, have, homing, capabilities, many, individuals, can, return, to, their, collection, points, after, being, released, elsewhere, trips, that, may, require, them, to, traverse, land, one, experiment, placed, 98, turtles, varying, several, kilometer, distances, from, their, home, wetland, 41, returned, when, living, in, a, single, large, body, of, water, the, painted, turtles, can, home, from, up, to, 6, km, 4, mi, away, another, experiment, found, that, if, placed, far, enough, away, from, water, the, turtles, will, just, walk, in, straight, paths, and, not, orient, towards, water, or, in, any, specific, direction, which, indicates, a, lack, of, homing, ability, females, may, use, homing, to, help, locate, suitable, nesting, sites, eastern, painted, turtle, movements, may, contribute, to, aquatic, plant, seed, dispersal, a, study, done, in, massachusetts, found, that, the, quantity, of, intact, macrophyte, seeds, defecated, by, eastern, painted, turtles, can, be, high, and, that, the, seeds, of, specifically, nymphaea, ordorata, that, were, found, in, feces, were, capable, of, moderate, to, high, level, germination, as, turtles, move, between, ponds, and, habitats, they, carry, seeds, along, with, them, to, new, locations, the, species, is, currently, classified, as, least, concern, by, the, iucn, but, populations, have, been, subject, to, decline, locally, the, decline, in, painted, turtle, populations, is, not, a, simple, matter, of, dramatic, range, reduction, like, that, of, the, american, bison, instead, the, turtle, is, classified, as, g5, demonstrably, widespread, in, its, natural, heritage, global, rank, and, the, iucn, rates, it, as, a, species, of, least, concern, the, painted, turtle, s, high, reproduction, rate, and, its, ability, to, survive, in, polluted, wetlands, and, artificially, made, ponds, have, allowed, it, to, maintain, its, range, but, the, post, columbus, settlement, of, north, america, has, reduced, its, numbers, only, within, the, pacific, northwest, is, the, turtle, s, range, eroding, even, there, in, washington, the, painted, turtle, is, designated, s5, demonstrably, widespread, however, in, oregon, the, painted, turtle, is, designated, s2, imperiled, and, in, british, columbia, the, turtle, s, populations, in, the, coast, and, interior, regions, are, labeled, endangered, and, of, special, concern, respectively, much, is, written, about, the, different, factors, that, threaten, the, painted, turtle, but, they, are, unquantified, with, only, inferences, of, relative, importance, a, primary, threat, category, is, habitat, loss, in, various, forms, related, to, water, habitat, there, is, drying, of, wetlands, clearing, of, aquatic, logs, or, rocks, basking, sites, and, clearing, of, shoreline, vegetation, which, allows, more, predator, access, or, increased, human, foot, traffic, related, to, nesting, habitat, urbanization, or, planting, can, remove, needed, sunny, soils, another, significant, human, impact, is, roadkill, dead, turtles, especially, females, are, commonly, seen, on, summer, roads, in, addition, to, direct, killing, roads, genetically, isolate, some,
