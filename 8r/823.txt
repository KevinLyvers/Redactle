the, platypus, ornithorhynchus, anatinus, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, duck, billed, platypus, is, a, semiaquatic, egg, laying, mammal, endemic, to, eastern, australia, including, tasmania, the, platypus, is, the, sole, living, representative, or, monotypic, taxon, of, its, family, ornithorhynchidae, and, genus, ornithorhynchus, though, a, number, of, related, species, appear, in, the, fossil, record, together, with, the, four, species, of, echidna, it, is, one, of, the, five, extant, species, of, monotremes, mammals, that, lay, eggs, instead, of, giving, birth, to, live, young, like, other, monotremes, the, platypus, senses, prey, in, cloudy, water, through, electrolocation, it, is, one, of, the, few, species, of, venomous, mammals, as, the, male, platypus, has, a, spur, on, the, hind, foot, that, delivers, an, extremely, painful, venom, the, unusual, appearance, of, this, egg, laying, duck, billed, beaver, tailed, otter, footed, mammal, at, first, baffled, european, naturalists, in, 1799, the, first, scientists, to, examine, a, preserved, platypus, body, judged, it, a, fake, made, of, several, animals, sewn, together, the, unique, features, of, the, platypus, make, it, important, in, the, study, of, evolutionary, biology, and, a, recognisable, and, iconic, symbol, of, australia, it, is, culturally, significant, to, several, aboriginal, peoples, who, also, used, to, hunt, it, for, food, it, has, appeared, as, a, national, mascot, features, on, the, reverse, of, the, australian, twenty, cent, coin, and, is, an, emblem, of, the, state, of, new, south, wales, the, platypus, was, hunted, for, its, fur, but, it, has, been, a, legally, protected, species, in, all, states, where, it, occurs, since, 1912, its, population, is, not, under, severe, threat, although, captive, breeding, programs, have, had, slight, success, and, it, is, vulnerable, to, pollution, it, is, classified, as, a, near, threatened, species, by, the, iucn, but, a, november, 2020, report, has, recommended, that, it, be, upgraded, to, threatened, species, under, the, federal, epbc, act, due, to, habitat, destruction, and, declining, numbers, in, all, states, when, the, platypus, was, first, encountered, by, europeans, in, 1798, a, pelt, and, sketch, were, sent, back, to, great, britain, by, captain, john, hunter, the, second, governor, of, new, south, wales, british, scientists, initial, hunch, was, that, the, attributes, were, a, hoax, george, shaw, who, produced, the, first, description, of, the, animal, in, the, naturalist, s, miscellany, in, 1799, stated, it, was, impossible, not, to, entertain, doubts, as, to, its, genuine, nature, and, robert, knox, believed, it, might, have, been, produced, by, some, asian, taxidermist, it, was, thought, that, somebody, had, sewn, a, duck, s, beak, onto, the, body, of, a, beaver, like, animal, shaw, even, took, a, pair, of, scissors, to, the, dried, skin, to, check, for, stitches, the, common, name, platypus, literally, means, flat, foot, deriving, from, the, greek, word, plat, pous, from, plat, s, broad, wide, flat, and, po, s, foot, shaw, initially, assigned, the, species, the, linnaean, name, platypus, anatinus, when, he, described, it, but, the, genus, term, was, quickly, discovered, to, already, be, in, use, as, the, name, of, the, wood, boring, ambrosia, beetle, genus, platypus, it, was, independently, described, as, ornithorhynchus, paradoxus, by, johann, blumenbach, in, 1800, from, a, specimen, given, to, him, by, sir, joseph, banks, and, following, the, rules, of, priority, of, nomenclature, it, was, later, officially, recognised, as, ornithorhynchus, anatinus, there, is, no, universally, agreed, plural, form, of, platypus, in, the, english, language, scientists, generally, use, platypuses, or, simply, platypus, alternatively, the, term, platypi, is, also, used, for, the, plural, although, this, is, a, form, of, pseudo, latin, going, by, the, word, s, greek, roots, the, plural, would, be, platypodes, early, british, settlers, called, it, by, many, names, such, as, watermole, duckbill, and, duckmole, occasionally, it, is, specifically, called, the, duck, billed, platypus, the, scientific, name, ornithorhynchus, anatinus, literally, means, duck, like, bird, snout, deriving, its, genus, name, from, the, greek, root, ornith, ornith, or, rn, s, bird, and, the, word, rh, nkhos, snout, beak, its, species, name, is, derived, from, latin, anatinus, duck, like, from, anas, duck, the, platypus, is, the, sole, living, representative, or, monotypic, taxon, of, its, family, ornithorhynchidae, in, david, collins, s, account, of, the, new, colony, 1788, 1801, he, describes, an, amphibious, animal, of, the, mole, species, with, a, drawing, the, body, and, the, broad, flat, tail, of, the, platypus, are, covered, with, dense, brown, biofluorescent, fur, that, traps, a, layer, of, insulating, air, to, keep, the, animal, warm, the, fur, is, waterproof, and, textured, like, that, of, a, mole, the, platypus, tail, stores, fat, reserves, an, adaptation, also, found, in, the, tasmanian, devil, webbing, is, more, significant, on, the, front, feet, which, in, land, walking, are, folded, up, in, knuckle, walking, to, protect, the, webbing, the, elongated, snout, and, lower, jaw, are, covered, in, soft, skin, forming, the, bill, the, nostrils, are, located, on, the, snout, s, dorsal, surface, while, the, eyes, and, ears, are, just, behind, the, snout, in, a, groove, which, closes, underwater, platypuses, can, give, a, low, growl, when, disturbed, and, a, range, of, vocalisations, have, been, reported, in, captivity, size, varies, considerably, in, different, regions, with, average, weight, from, 0, 7, to, 2, 4, kg, 1, lb, 9, oz, to, 5, lb, 5, oz, males, have, average, length, 50, cm, 20, in, while, females, are, the, smaller, at, 43, cm, 17, in, this, variation, does, not, seem, to, follow, any, particular, climatic, rule, and, may, be, due, to, other, factors, such, as, predation, and, human, encroachment, the, platypus, has, an, average, body, temperature, of, about, 32, c, 90, f, lower, than, the, 37, c, 99, f, typical, of, placental, mammals, research, suggests, this, has, been, a, gradual, adaptation, to, harsh, environmental, conditions, among, the, few, marginal, surviving, monotreme, species, rather, than, a, general, characteristic, of, past, monotremes, in, addition, to, laying, eggs, the, anatomy, ontogeny, and, genetics, of, monotremes, shows, traces, of, similarity, to, reptiles, and, birds, the, platypus, has, a, reptilian, gait, with, legs, on, the, sides, of, the, body, rather, than, underneath, the, platypus, s, genes, are, a, possible, evolutionary, link, between, the, mammalian, xy, and, bird, reptile, zw, sex, determination, systems, as, one, of, the, platypus, s, five, x, chromosomes, contains, the, dmrt1, gene, which, birds, possess, on, their, z, chromosome, as, in, all, true, mammals, the, tiny, bones, that, conduct, sound, in, the, middle, ear, are, fully, incorporated, into, the, skull, rather, than, lying, in, the, jaw, as, in, pre, mammalian, synapsids, however, the, external, opening, of, the, ear, still, lies, at, the, base, of, the, jaw, the, platypus, has, extra, bones, in, the, shoulder, girdle, including, an, interclavicle, not, found, in, other, mammals, as, in, many, other, aquatic, and, semiaquatic, vertebrates, the, bones, show, osteosclerosis, increasing, their, density, to, provide, ballast, the, platypus, jaw, is, constructed, differently, from, that, of, other, mammals, and, the, jaw, opening, muscle, is, different, modern, platypus, young, have, three, teeth, in, each, of, the, maxillae, one, premolar, and, two, molars, and, dentaries, three, molars, which, they, lose, before, or, just, after, leaving, the, breeding, burrow, adults, instead, develop, heavily, keratinised, food, grinding, pads, called, ceratodontes, the, first, upper, and, third, lower, cheek, teeth, of, platypus, nestlings, are, small, each, having, one, principal, cusp, while, the, other, teeth, have, two, main, cusps, while, both, male, and, female, platypuses, are, born, with, back, ankle, spurs, only, the, males, deliver, venom, it, is, powerful, enough, to, kill, smaller, animals, such, as, dogs, and, though, it, is, not, lethal, to, humans, it, can, inflict, weeks, of, agony, edema, rapidly, develops, around, the, wound, and, gradually, spreads, through, the, affected, limb, and, it, may, develop, into, an, excruciating, hyperalgesia, heightened, sensitivity, to, pain, persisting, for, days, or, even, months, the, venom, is, composed, largely, of, defensin, like, proteins, dlps, produced, by, the, immune, system, three, of, which, are, unique, to, the, platypus, in, other, animals, defensins, kill, pathogenic, bacteria, and, viruses, but, in, platypuses, they, are, also, collected, into, a, venom, against, predators, venom, is, produced, in, the, crural, glands, of, the, male, which, are, kidney, shaped, alveolar, glands, connected, by, a, thin, walled, duct, to, a, calcaneus, spur, on, each, hind, limb, the, female, platypus, in, common, with, echidnas, has, rudimentary, spur, buds, that, do, not, develop, dropping, off, before, the, end, of, their, first, year, and, lack, functional, crural, glands, venom, production, rises, among, males, during, the, breeding, season, and, it, may, be, used, to, assert, dominance, similar, spurs, are, found, on, many, archaic, mammal, groups, indicating, that, this, was, an, ancient, general, characteristic, among, mammals, monotremes, are, the, only, mammals, apart, from, the, guiana, dolphin, known, to, have, a, sense, of, electroreception, and, the, platypus, s, electroreception, is, the, most, sensitive, of, any, monotreme, feeding, by, neither, sight, nor, smell, the, platypus, closes, its, eyes, ears, and, nose, when, it, dives, digging, in, the, bottom, of, streams, with, its, bill, its, electroreceptors, detect, tiny, electric, currents, generated, by, the, muscular, contractions, of, its, prey, enabling, it, to, distinguish, between, animate, and, inanimate, objects, experiments, have, shown, the, platypus, will, even, react, to, an, artificial, shrimp, if, a, small, electric, current, is, passed, through, it, the, electroreceptors, are, located, in, rostrocaudal, rows, in, the, skin, of, the, bill, while, mechanoreceptors, for, touch, are, uniformly, distributed, across, the, bill, the, electrosensory, area, of, the, cerebral, cortex, is, in, the, tactile, somatosensory, area, and, some, cortical, cells, receive, input, from, both, electroreceptors, and, mechanoreceptors, suggesting, the, platypus, feels, electric, fields, like, touches, these, receptors, in, the, bill, dominate, the, somatotopic, map, of, the, platypus, brain, in, the, same, way, human, hands, dominate, the, penfield, homunculus, map, the, platypus, can, feel, the, direction, of, an, electric, source, perhaps, by, comparing, differences, in, signal, strength, across, the, sheet, of, electroreceptors, enhanced, by, the, characteristic, side, to, side, motion, of, the, animal, s, head, while, hunting, it, may, also, be, able, to, determine, the, distance, of, moving, prey, from, the, time, lag, between, their, electrical, and, mechanical, pressure, pulses, monotreme, electrolocation, for, hunting, in, murky, waters, may, be, tied, to, their, tooth, loss, the, extinct, obdurodon, was, electroreceptive, but, unlike, the, modern, platypus, it, foraged, pelagically, near, the, ocean, surface, in, recent, studies, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, eyes, of, the, platypus, are, more, similar, to, those, of, pacific, hagfish, or, northern, hemisphere, lampreys, than, to, those, of, most, tetrapods, the, eyes, also, contain, double, cones, unlike, most, mammals, although, the, platypus, s, eyes, are, small, and, not, used, under, water, several, features, indicate, that, vision, was, important, for, its, ancestors, the, corneal, surface, and, the, adjacent, surface, of, the, lens, is, flat, while, the, posterior, surface, of, the, lens, is, steeply, curved, similar, to, the, eyes, of, other, aquatic, mammals, such, as, otters, and, sea, lions, a, temporal, ear, side, concentration, of, retinal, ganglion, cells, important, for, binocular, vision, indicates, a, vestigial, role, in, predation, though, the, actual, visual, acuity, is, insufficient, for, such, activities, limited, acuity, is, matched, by, low, cortical, magnification, a, small, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, and, a, large, optic, tectum, suggesting, that, the, visual, midbrain, plays, a, more, important, role, than, the, visual, cortex, as, in, some, rodents, these, features, suggest, that, the, platypus, has, adapted, to, an, aquatic, and, nocturnal, lifestyle, developing, its, electrosensory, system, at, the, cost, of, its, visual, system, this, contrasts, with, the, small, number, of, electroreceptors, in, the, short, beaked, echidna, which, dwells, in, dry, environments, while, the, long, beaked, echidna, which, lives, in, moist, environments, is, intermediate, between, the, other, two, monotremes, in, 2020, research, revealed, that, platypus, fur, gives, a, bluish, green, biofluorescent, glow, in, black, light, the, platypus, is, semiaquatic, inhabiting, small, streams, and, rivers, over, an, extensive, range, from, the, cold, highlands, of, tasmania, and, the, australian, alps, to, the, tropical, rainforests, of, coastal, queensland, as, far, north, as, the, base, of, the, cape, york, peninsula, inland, its, distribution, is, not, well, known, it, was, considered, extinct, on, the, south, australian, mainland, with, the, last, sighting, recorded, at, renmark, in, 1975, in, the, 1980s, john, wamsley, created, a, platypus, breeding, program, in, warrawong, sanctuary, see, below, which, subsequently, closed, in, 2017, there, were, some, unconfirmed, sightings, downstream, from, the, sanctuary, and, in, october, 2020, a, nesting, platypus, was, filmed, inside, the, recently, reopened, sanctuary, there, is, a, population, on, kangaroo, island, introduced, in, the, 1920s, said, to, stand, at, 150, individuals, in, the, rocky, river, region, of, flinders, chase, national, park, in, the, 2019, 20, australian, bushfire, season, large, portions, of, the, island, burnt, decimating, wildlife, however, sa, department, for, environment, and, water, recovery, teams, worked, to, reinstate, their, habitat, with, a, number, of, sightings, reported, by, april, 2020, the, platypus, is, no, longer, found, in, the, main, murray, darling, basin, possibly, due, to, declining, water, quality, from, land, clearing, and, irrigation, although, it, is, found, in, the, goulburn, river, in, victoria, along, the, coastal, river, systems, its, distribution, is, unpredictable, absent, in, some, relatively, healthy, rivers, but, present, in, some, quite, degraded, ones, for, example, the, lower, maribyrnong, in, captivity, platypuses, have, survived, to, 30, years, of, age, and, wild, specimens, have, been, recaptured, when, 24, years, old, mortality, rates, for, adults, in, the, wild, appear, to, be, low, natural, predators, include, snakes, water, rats, goannas, hawks, owls, and, eagles, low, platypus, numbers, in, northern, australia, are, possibly, due, to, predation, by, crocodiles, the, introduction, of, red, foxes, in, 1845, for, sport, hunting, may, have, had, some, impact, on, its, numbers, on, the, mainland, the, platypus, is, generally, nocturnal, and, crepuscular, but, can, be, active, on, overcast, days, its, habitat, bridges, rivers, and, the, riparian, zone, where, it, finds, both, prey, and, river, banks, to, dig, resting, and, nesting, burrows, it, may, have, a, range, of, up, to, 7, km, 4, 3, mi, with, a, male, s, home, range, overlapping, those, of, three, or, four, females, the, platypus, is, an, excellent, swimmer, and, spends, much, of, its, time, in, the, water, foraging, for, food, it, has, a, swimming, style, unique, among, mammals, propelling, itself, by, alternate, strokes, of, the, front, feet, while, the, webbed, hind, feet, are, held, against, the, body, and, only, used, for, steering, along, with, the, tail, it, can, maintain, its, relatively, low, body, temperature, of, about, 32, c, 90, f, while, foraging, for, hours, in, water, below, 5, c, 41, f, dives, normally, last, around, 30, seconds, with, an, estimated, aerobic, limit, of, 40, seconds, with, 10, to, 20, seconds, at, the, surface, between, dives, the, platypus, rests, in, a, short, straight, burrow, in, the, riverbank, about, 30, cm, 12, in, above, water, level, its, oval, entrance, hole, often, hidden, under, a, tangle, of, roots, it, may, sleep, up, to, 14, hours, per, day, after, half, a, day, of, diving, the, platypus, is, a, carnivore, feeding, on, annelid, worms, insect, larvae, freshwater, shrimp, and, yabby, crayfish, that, it, digs, out, of, the, riverbed, with, its, snout, or, catches, while, swimming, it, carries, prey, to, the, surface, in, cheek, pouches, before, eating, it, it, eats, about, 20, of, its, own, weight, each, day, which, requires, it, to, spend, an, average, of, 12, hours, daily, looking, for, food, the, species, has, a, single, breeding, season, between, june, and, october, with, some, local, variation, investigations, have, found, both, resident, and, transient, platypuses, and, suggest, a, polygynous, mating, system, females, are, believed, to, become, sexually, mature, in, their, second, year, with, breeding, observed, in, animals, over, nine, years, old, the, male, takes, no, part, in, nesting, living, in, his, year, long, resting, burrow, after, mating, the, female, constructs, a, deep, elaborate, nesting, burrow, up, to, 20, m, 65, ft, long, it, tucks, fallen, leaves, and, reeds, underneath, its, curled, tail, dragging, them, to, the, burrow, to, soften, the, tunnel, floor, with, folded, wet, leaves, and, to, line, the, nest, at, the, end, with, bedding, the, female, has, two, ovaries, but, only, the, left, one, is, functional, it, lays, one, to, three, usually, two, small, leathery, eggs, similar, to, those, of, reptiles, about, 11, mm, 7, 16, in, in, diameter, and, slightly, rounder, than, bird, eggs, the, eggs, develop, in, utero, for, about, 28, days, with, only, about, 10, days, of, external, incubation, in, contrast, to, a, chicken, egg, which, spends, about, one, day, in, tract, and, 21, days, externally, the, female, curls, around, the, incubating, eggs, which, develop, in, three, phases, in, the, first, the, embryo, has, no, functional, organs, and, relies, on, the, yolk, sac, for, sustenance, until, the, sac, is, absorbed, during, the, second, phase, the, digits, develop, and, in, the, last, phase, the, egg, tooth, appears, at, first, european, naturalists, could, hardly, believe, that, the, female, platypus, lays, eggs, but, this, was, finally, confirmed, by, william, hay, caldwell, in, 1884, most, mammal, zygotes, go, through, holoblastic, cleavage, splitting, into, multiple, divisible, daughter, cells, however, monotremes, like, the, platypus, along, with, reptiles, and, birds, undergo, meroblastic, cleavage, in, which, the, ovum, does, not, split, completely, the, cells, at, the, edge, of, the, yolk, remain, continuous, with, the, egg, s, cytoplasm, allowing, the, yolk, and, embryo, to, exchange, waste, and, nutrients, with, the, egg, through, the, cytoplasm, young, platypus, are, called, puggles, newly, hatched, platypuses, are, vulnerable, blind, and, hairless, and, are, fed, by, the, mother, s, milk, that, provides, all, the, requirements, for, growth, and, development, the, platypus, mammary, glands, lack, teats, with, milk, released, through, pores, in, the, skin, the, milk, pools, in, grooves, on, the, mother, s, abdomen, allowing, the, young, to, lap, it, up, after, they, hatch, the, offspring, are, milk, fed, for, three, to, four, months, during, incubation, and, weaning, the, mother, initially, leaves, the, burrow, only, for, short, periods, to, forage, she, leaves, behind, her, a, number, of, thin, soil, plugs, along, the, length, of, the, burrow, possibly, to, protect, the, young, from, predators, pushing, past, these, on, her, return, squeezes, water, from, her, fur, and, allows, the, burrow, to, remain, dry, after, about, five, weeks, the, mother, begins, to, spend, more, time, away, from, her, young, and, at, around, four, months, the, young, emerge, from, the, burrow, a, platypus, is, born, with, teeth, but, these, drop, out, at, a, very, early, age, leaving, the, horny, plates, it, uses, to, grind, food, platypus, echidnas, marsupials, eutherians, the, platypus, and, other, monotremes, were, very, poorly, understood, and, some, of, the, 19th, century, myths, that, grew, up, around, them, for, example, that, the, monotremes, were, inferior, or, quasireptilian, still, endure, in, 1947, william, king, gregory, theorised, that, placental, mammals, and, marsupials, may, have, diverged, earlier, and, a, subsequent, branching, divided, the, monotremes, and, marsupials, but, later, research, and, fossil, discoveries, have, suggested, this, is, incorrect, in, fact, modern, monotremes, are, the, survivors, of, an, early, branching, of, the, mammal, tree, and, a, later, branching, is, thought, to, have, led, to, the, marsupial, and, placental, groups, molecular, clock, and, fossil, dating, suggest, platypuses, split, from, echidnas, around, 19, 48, million, years, ago, the, oldest, discovered, fossil, of, the, modern, platypus, dates, back, to, about, 100, 000, years, ago, during, the, quaternary, period, though, a, limb, bone, of, ornithorhynchus, is, known, from, pliocene, aged, strata, the, extinct, monotremes, teinolophos, and, steropodon, from, the, cretaceous, were, once, thought, to, be, closely, related, to, the, modern, platypus, but, are, now, considered, more, basal, taxa, the, fossilised, steropodon, was, discovered, in, new, south, wales, and, is, composed, of, an, opalised, lower, jawbone, with, three, molar, teeth, whereas, the, adult, contemporary, platypus, is, toothless, the, molar, teeth, were, initially, thought, to, be, tribosphenic, which, would, have, supported, a, variation, of, gregory, s, theory, but, later, research, has, suggested, while, they, have, three, cusps, they, evolved, under, a, separate, process, the, fossil, jaw, of, teinolophos, is, thought, to, be, about, 110, million, years, old, making, it, the, oldest, mammal, fossil, found, in, australia, unlike, the, modern, platypus, and, echidnas, teinolophos, lacked, a, beak, in, 2024, late, cretaceous, cenomanian, aged, fossil, specimens, of, actual, early, platypus, relatives, were, recovered, from, the, same, rocks, as, steropodon, including, the, basal, opalios, and, the, more, derived, dharragarra, the, latter, of, which, may, be, the, oldest, member, of, the, platypus, stem, lineage, as, it, retains, the, same, dental, formula, found, in, cenozoic, platypus, relatives, monotrematum, and, patagorhynchus, two, other, fossil, relatives, of, the, platypus, are, known, from, the, latest, cretaceous, maastrichtian, and, the, mid, paleocene, of, argentina, indicating, that, some, monotremes, managed, to, colonize, south, america, from, australia, when, the, two, continents, were, connected, via, antarctica, these, are, also, considered, potential, members, of, the, platypus, stem, lineage, the, closest, fossil, relative, of, the, platypus, was, obdurodon, known, from, the, late, oligocene, to, the, miocene, of, australia, it, closely, resembled, the, modern, platypus, aside, from, the, presence, of, molar, teeth, a, fossilised, tooth, of, the, giant, platypus, obdurodon, tharalkooschild, was, dated, 5, 15, million, years, ago, judging, by, the, tooth, the, animal, measured, 1, 3, metres, long, making, it, the, largest, platypus, on, record, the, loss, of, teeth, in, the, modern, platypus, has, long, been, enigmatic, as, a, distinctive, lower, molar, tooth, row, was, previously, present, in, its, lineage, for, over, 95, million, years, even, its, closest, relative, obdurodon, which, otherwise, closely, resembles, the, platypus, retained, this, tooth, row, more, recent, studies, indicate, that, this, tooth, loss, was, a, geologically, very, recent, event, occurring, only, around, the, plio, pleistocene, around, 2, 5, million, years, ago, when, the, rakali, a, large, semiaquatic, rodent, colonized, australia, from, new, guinea, the, platypus, which, previously, fed, on, a, wide, array, of, hard, and, soft, bodied, prey, was, outcompeted, by, the, rakali, over, hard, bodied, prey, such, as, crayfish, and, mussels, this, competition, may, have, selected, for, the, loss, of, teeth, in, the, platypus, and, their, replacement, by, horny, pads, as, a, way, of, specializing, for, softer, bodied, prey, which, the, rakali, did, not, compete, with, it, over, because, of, the, early, divergence, from, the, therian, mammals, and, the, low, numbers, of, extant, monotreme, species, the, platypus, is, a, frequent, subject, of, research, in, evolutionary, biology, in, 2004, researchers, at, the, australian, national, university, discovered, the, platypus, has, ten, sex, chromosomes, compared, with, two, xy, in, most, other, mammals, these, ten, chromosomes, form, five, unique, pairs, of, xy, in, males, and, xx, in, females, i, e, males, are, x, 1, y, 1, x, 2, y, 2, x, 3, y, 3, x, 4, y, 4, x, 5, y, 5, one, of, the, x, chromosomes, of, the, platypus, has, great, homology, to, the, bird, z, chromosome, the, platypus, genome, also, has, both, reptilian, and, mammalian, genes, associated, with, egg, fertilisation, though, the, platypus, lacks, the, mammalian, sex, determining, gene, sry, a, study, found, that, the, mechanism, of, sex, determination, is, the, amh, gene, on, the, oldest, y, chromosome, a, draft, version, of, the, platypus, genome, sequence, was, published, in, nature, on, 8, may, 2008, revealing, both, reptilian, and, mammalian, elements, as, well, as, two, genes, found, previously, only, in, birds, amphibians, and, fish, more, than, 80, of, the, platypus, s, genes, are, common, to, the, other, mammals, whose, genomes, have, been, sequenced, an, updated, genome, the, most, complete, on, record, was, published, in, 2021, together, with, the, genome, of, the, short, beaked, echidna, except, for, its, loss, from, the, state, of, south, australia, the, platypus, occupies, the, same, general, distribution, as, it, did, prior, to, european, settlement, of, australia, however, local, changes, and, fragmentation, of, distribution, due, to, human, modification, of, its, habitat, are, documented, its, historical, abundance, is, unknown, and, its, current, abundance, difficult, to, gauge, but, it, is, assumed, to, have, declined, in, numbers, although, as, of, 1998, was, still, being, considered, as, common, over, most, of, its, current, range, the, species, was, extensively, hunted, for, its, fur, until, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, although, the, species, gained, legal, protections, beginning, in, victoria, in, 1890, and, throughout, australia, by, 1912, until, about, 1950, it, was, still, at, risk, of, drowning, in, the, nets, of, inland, fisheries, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, recategorised, its, status, as, near, threatened, in, 2016, the, species, is, protected, by, law, but, the, only, state, in, which, it, is, listed, as, endangered, is, south, australia, under, the, national, parks, and, wildlife, act, 1972, in, november, 2020, a, recommendation, was, made, to, list, the, platypus, as, a, vulnerable, species, across, all, states, with, a, vulnerable, listing, being, made, official, in, victoria, under, the, state, s, flora, and, fauna, guarantee, act, 1988, on, 10, january, 2021, the, platypus, is, not, considered, to, be, in, immediate, danger, of, extinction, because, conservation, measures, have, been, successful, but, it, could, be, adversely, affected, by, habitat, disruption, caused, by, dams, irrigation, pollution, netting, and, trapping, reduction, of, watercourse, flows, and, water, levels, through, excessive, droughts, and, extraction, of, water, for, industrial, agricultural, and, domestic, supplies, are, also, considered, a, threat, the, iucn, lists, the, platypus, on, its, red, list, as, near, threatened, as, assessed, in, 2016, when, it, was, estimated, that, numbers, had, reduced, by, about, 30, percent, on, average, since, european, settlement, the, animal, is, listed, as, endangered, in, south, australia, but, it, is, not, covered, at, all, under, the, federal, epbc, act, researchers, have, worried, for, years, that, declines, have, been, greater, than, assumed, in, january, 2020, researchers, from, the, university, of, new, south, wales, presented, evidence, that, the, platypus, is, at, risk, of, extinction, due, to, a, combination, of, extraction, of, water, resources, land, clearing, climate, change, and, severe, drought, the, study, predicted, that, considering, current, threats, the, animals, abundance, would, decline, by, 47, 66, and, metapopulation, occupancy, by, 22, 32, over, 50, years, causing, extinction, of, local, populations, across, about, 40, of, the, range, under, projections, of, climate, change, projections, to, 2070, reduced, habitat, due, to, drought, would, lead, to, 51, 73, reduced, abundance, and, 36, 56, reduced, metapopulation, occupancy, within, 50, years, respectively, these, predictions, suggested, that, the, species, would, fall, under, the, vulnerable, classification, the, authors, stressed, the, need, for, national, conservation, efforts, which, might, include, conducting, more, surveys, tracking, trends, reduction, of, threats, and, improvement, of, river, management, to, ensure, healthy, platypus, habitat, co, author, gilad, bino, is, concerned, that, the, estimates, of, the, 2016, baseline, numbers, could, be, wrong, and, numbers, may, have, been, reduced, by, as, much, as, half, already, a, november, 2020, report, by, scientists, from, the, university, of, new, south, wales, funded, by, a, research, grant, from, the, australian, conservation, foundation, in, collaboration, with, the, world, wildlife, fund, australia, and, the, humane, society, international, australia, revealed, that, that, platypus, habitat, in, australia, had, shrunk, by, 22, per, cent, in, the, previous, 30, years, and, recommended, that, the, platypus, should, be, listed, as, a, threatened, species, under, the, epbc, act, declines, in, population, had, been, greatest, in, nsw, in, particular, in, the, murray, darling, basin, platypuses, generally, suffer, from, few, diseases, in, the, wild, however, as, of, 2008, there, was, concern, in, tasmania, about, the, potential, impacts, of, a, disease, caused, by, the, fungus, mucor, amphibiorum, the, disease, termed, mucormycosis, affects, only, tasmanian, platypuses, and, had, not, been, observed, in, platypuses, in, mainland, australia, affected, platypuses, can, develop, skin, lesions, or, ulcers, on, various, parts, of, their, bodies, including, their, backs, tails, and, legs, mucormycosis, can, kill, platypuses, death, arising, from, secondary, infection, and, by, affecting, the, animals, ability, to, maintain, body, temperature, and, forage, efficiently, the, biodiversity, conservation, branch, at, the, department, of, primary, industries, and, water, collaborated, with, nrm, north, and, university, of, tasmania, researchers, to, determine, the, impacts, of, the, disease, on, tasmanian, platypuses, as, well, as, the, mechanism, of, transmission, and, spread, of, the, disease, much, of, the, world, was, introduced, to, the, platypus, in, 1939, when, national, geographic, magazine, published, an, article, on, the, platypus, and, the, efforts, to, study, and, raise, it, in, captivity, the, latter, is, a, difficult, task, and, only, a, few, young, have, been, successfully, raised, since, notably, at, healesville, sanctuary, in, victoria, the, leading, figure, in, these, efforts, was, david, fleay, who, established, a, platypusary, a, simulated, stream, in, a, tank, at, the, healesville, sanctuary, where, breeding, was, successful, in, 1943, in, 1972, he, found, a, dead, baby, of, about, 50, days, old, which, had, presumably, been, born, in, captivity, at, his, wildlife, park, at, burleigh, heads, on, the, gold, coast, queensland, healesville, repeated, its, success, in, 1998, and, again, in, 2000, with, a, similar, stream, tank, since, 2008, platypus, has, bred, regularly, at, healesville, including, second, generation, captive, born, themselves, breeding, in, captivity, taronga, zoo, in, sydney, bred, twins, in, 2003, and, breeding, was, again, successful, there, in, 2006, as, of, 2019, the, only, platypuses, in, captivity, outside, of, australia, are, in, the, san, diego, zoo, safari, park, in, the, u, s, state, of, california, three, attempts, were, made, to, bring, the, animals, to, the, bronx, zoo, in, 1922, 1947, and, 1958, of, these, only, two, of, the, three, animals, introduced, in, 1947, penelope, and, cecil, lived, longer, than, eighteen, months, aboriginal, australians, used, to, hunt, platypuses, for, food, their, fatty, tails, being, particularly, nutritious, while, after, colonisation, europeans, hunted, them, for, fur, from, the, late, 19th, century, until, 1912, when, it, was, prohibited, by, law, in, addition, european, researchers, captured, and, killed, platypus, or, removed, their, eggs, partly, in, order, to, increase, scientific, knowledge, but, also, to, gain, prestige, and, outcompete, rivals, from, different, countries, the, platypus, has, been, a, subject, in, the, dreamtime, stories, of, aboriginal, australians, some, of, whom, believed, the, animal, was, a, hybrid, of, a, duck, and, a, water, rat, 57, 60, according, to, one, story, of, the, upper, darling, river, the, major, animal, groups, the, land, animals, water, animals, and, birds, all, competed, for, the, platypus, to, join, their, respective, groups, but, the, platypus, ultimately, decided, to, not, join, any, of, them, feeling, that, he, did, not, need, to, be, part, of, a, group, to, be, special, 83, 85, and, wished, to, remain, friends, with, all, of, those, groups, another, dreaming, story, emanate, of, the, upper, darling, tells, of, a, young, duck, which, ventured, too, far, ignoring, the, warnings, of, her, tribe, and, was, kidnapped, by, a, large, water, rat, called, biggoon, after, managing, to, escape, after, some, time, she, returned, and, laid, two, eggs, which, hatched, into, strange, furry, creatures, so, they, were, all, banished, and, went, to, live, in, the, mountains, the, platypus, is, also, used, by, some, aboriginal, peoples, as, a, totem, which, is, to, them, a, natural, object, plant, or, animal, that, is, inherited, by, members, of, a, clan, or, family, as, their, spiritual, emblem, and, the, animal, holds, special, meaning, as, a, totem, animal, for, the, wadi, wadi, people, who, live, along, the, murray, river, because, of, their, cultural, significance, and, importance, in, connection, to, country, the, platypus, is, protected, and, conserved, by, these, indigenous, peoples, the, platypus, has, often, been, used, as, a, symbol, of, australia, s, cultural, identity, in, the, 1940s, live, platypuses, were, given, to, allies, in, the, second, world, war, in, order, to, strengthen, ties, and, boost, morale, platypuses, have, been, used, several, times, as, mascots, syd, the, platypus, was, one, of, the, three, mascots, chosen, for, the, sydney, 2000, summer, olympics, along, with, an, echidna, and, a, kookaburra, expo, oz, the, platypus, was, the, mascot, for, world, expo, 88, which, was, held, in, brisbane, in, 1988, and, hexley, the, platypus, is, the, mascot, for, the, darwin, operating, system, the, bsd, based, core, of, macos, and, other, operating, systems, from, apple, inc, since, the, introduction, of, decimal, currency, to, australia, in, 1966, the, embossed, image, of, a, platypus, designed, and, sculpted, by, stuart, devlin, has, appeared, on, the, reverse, tails, side, of, the, 20, cent, coin, the, platypus, has, frequently, appeared, in, australian, postage, stamps, most, recently, the, 2015, native, animals, series, and, the, 2016, australian, animals, monotremes, series, in, the, american, animated, series, phineas, and, ferb, the, title, characters, own, a, pet, bluish, green, platypus, named, perry, who, unknown, to, them, is, a, secret, agent, such, choices, were, inspired, by, media, underuse, as, well, as, to, exploit, the, animal, s, striking, appearance, additionally, show, creator, dan, povenmire, who, also, wrote, the, character, s, theme, song, said, that, its, opening, lyrics, are, based, on, the, introductory, sentence, of, the, platypus, article, on, wikipedia, copying, the, semiaquatic, egg, laying,
