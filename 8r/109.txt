a, nail, is, a, protective, plate, characteristically, found, at, the, tip, of, the, digits, fingers, and, toes, of, all, primates, corresponding, to, the, claws, in, other, tetrapod, animals, fingernails, and, toenails, are, made, of, a, tough, rigid, protein, called, alpha, keratin, a, polymer, also, found, in, the, claws, hooves, and, horns, of, vertebrates, the, nail, consists, of, the, nail, plate, the, nail, matrix, and, the, nail, bed, below, it, and, the, grooves, surrounding, it, the, nail, matrix, is, the, active, tissue, or, germinal, matrix, that, generates, cells, the, cells, harden, as, they, move, outward, from, the, nail, root, to, the, nail, plate, the, nail, matrix, is, also, known, as, the, matrix, unguis, keratogenous, membrane, or, onychostroma, it, is, the, part, of, the, nail, bed, that, is, beneath, the, nail, and, contains, nerves, lymph, and, blood, vessels, the, matrix, produces, cells, that, become, the, nail, plate, the, width, and, thickness, of, the, nail, plate, is, determined, by, the, size, length, and, thickness, of, the, matrix, while, the, shape, of, the, fingertip, bone, determines, if, the, nail, plate, is, flat, arched, or, hooked, the, matrix, will, continue, to, produce, cells, as, long, as, it, receives, nutrition, and, remains, in, a, healthy, condition, as, new, nail, plate, cells, are, made, they, push, older, nail, plate, cells, forward, and, in, this, way, older, cells, become, compressed, flat, and, translucent, this, makes, the, capillaries, in, the, nail, bed, below, visible, resulting, in, a, pink, color, the, lunula, small, moon, is, the, visible, part, of, the, matrix, the, whitish, crescent, shaped, base, of, the, visible, nail, the, lunula, can, best, be, seen, in, the, thumb, and, may, not, be, visible, in, the, little, finger, the, lunula, appears, white, due, to, a, reflection, of, light, at, the, point, where, the, nail, matrix, and, nail, bed, meet, the, nail, bed, is, the, skin, beneath, the, nail, plate, it, is, the, area, of, the, nail, on, which, the, nail, plate, rests, nerves, and, blood, vessels, found, here, supply, nourishment, to, the, entire, nail, unit, like, all, skin, it, is, made, of, two, types, of, tissues, the, dermis, and, the, epidermis, the, epidermis, is, attached, to, the, dermis, by, tiny, longitudinal, grooves, called, matrix, crests, cristae, matricis, unguis, in, old, age, the, nail, plate, becomes, thinner, and, these, grooves, become, more, visible, the, nail, bed, is, highly, innervated, and, removal, of, the, nail, plate, is, often, excruciatingly, painful, as, a, result, the, nail, sinus, sinus, unguis, is, where, the, nail, root, is, i, e, the, base, of, the, nail, underneath, the, skin, it, originates, from, the, actively, growing, tissue, below, the, matrix, the, nail, plate, corpus, unguis, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, nail, body, is, the, visible, hard, nail, area, from, the, nail, root, to, the, free, edge, made, of, translucent, keratin, protein, several, layers, of, dead, compacted, cells, cause, the, nail, to, be, strong, but, flexible, its, transverse, shape, is, determined, by, the, form, of, the, underlying, bone, in, common, usage, the, word, nail, often, refers, to, this, part, only, the, nail, plate, is, strongly, attached, to, the, nail, bed, and, does, not, contain, any, nerves, or, blood, vessels, the, free, margin, margo, liber, or, distal, edge, is, the, anterior, margin, of, the, nail, plate, corresponds, to, the, abrasive, or, cutting, edge, of, the, nail, the, hyponychium, informally, known, as, the, quick, is, the, epithelium, located, beneath, the, nail, plate, at, the, junction, between, the, free, edge, and, the, skin, of, the, fingertip, it, forms, a, seal, that, protects, the, nail, bed, the, onychodermal, band, is, the, seal, between, the, nail, plate, and, the, hyponychium, it, is, just, under, the, free, edge, in, that, portion, of, the, nail, where, the, nail, bed, ends, and, can, be, recognized, in, fair, skinned, people, by, its, glassy, greyish, colour, it, is, not, visible, in, some, individuals, while, it, is, highly, prominent, on, others, together, the, eponychium, and, the, cuticle, form, a, protective, seal, the, cuticle, is, the, semi, circular, layer, of, almost, invisible, dead, skin, cells, that, ride, out, on, and, cover, the, back, of, the, visible, nail, plate, the, eponychium, is, the, fold, of, skin, cells, that, produces, the, cuticle, they, are, continuous, and, some, references, view, them, as, one, entity, thus, the, names, eponychium, cuticle, and, perionychium, would, be, synonymous, although, a, distinction, is, still, drawn, here, it, is, the, cuticle, nonliving, part, that, is, removed, during, a, manicure, but, the, eponychium, living, part, should, not, be, touched, due, to, risk, of, infection, the, eponychium, is, a, small, band, of, living, cells, epithelium, that, extends, from, the, posterior, nail, wall, onto, the, base, of, the, nail, the, eponychium, is, the, end, of, the, proximal, fold, that, folds, back, upon, itself, to, shed, an, epidermal, layer, of, skin, onto, the, newly, formed, nail, plate, the, perionyx, is, the, projecting, edge, of, the, eponychium, covering, the, proximal, strip, of, the, lunula, the, nail, wall, vallum, unguis, is, the, cutaneous, fold, overlapping, the, sides, and, proximal, end, of, the, nail, the, lateral, margin, margo, lateralis, lies, beneath, the, nail, wall, on, the, sides, of, the, nail, and, the, nail, groove, or, fold, sulcus, matricis, unguis, are, the, cutaneous, slits, into, which, the, lateral, margins, are, embedded, the, paronychium, is, the, soft, tissue, border, around, the, nail, and, paronychia, is, an, infection, in, this, area, the, paronychium, is, the, skin, that, overlaps, onto, the, sides, of, the, nail, plate, also, known, as, the, paronychial, edge, the, paronychium, is, the, site, of, hangnails, ingrown, nails, and, paronychia, a, skin, infection, the, hyponychium, is, the, area, of, epithelium, particularly, the, thickened, portion, underlying, the, free, edge, of, the, nail, plate, it, is, sometimes, called, the, quick, as, in, the, phrase, cutting, to, the, quick, a, healthy, fingernail, has, the, function, of, protecting, the, distal, phalanx, the, fingertip, and, the, surrounding, soft, tissues, from, injuries, it, also, serves, to, enhance, precise, delicate, movements, of, the, distal, digits, through, counter, pressure, exerted, on, the, pulp, of, the, finger, the, nail, then, acts, as, a, counter, force, when, the, end, of, the, finger, touches, an, object, thereby, enhancing, the, sensitivity, of, the, fingertip, although, the, nail, itself, has, no, nerve, endings, finally, the, nail, functions, as, a, tool, enabling, a, so, called, extended, precision, grip, e, g, pulling, out, a, splinter, in, one, s, finger, and, certain, cutting, or, scraping, actions, the, growing, part, of, the, nail, is, under, the, skin, at, the, nail, s, proximal, end, under, the, epidermis, which, is, the, only, living, part, of, a, nail, in, mammals, the, growth, rate, of, nails, is, related, to, the, length, of, the, terminal, phalanges, outermost, finger, bones, thus, in, humans, the, nail, of, the, index, finger, grows, faster, than, that, of, the, little, finger, and, fingernails, grow, up, to, four, times, faster, than, toenails, in, humans, fingernails, grow, at, an, average, rate, of, approx, 3, 5, mm, 0, 14, in, a, month, whereas, toenails, grow, about, half, as, fast, approx, average, 1, 6, mm, 0, 063, in, a, month, fingernails, require, three, to, six, months, to, regrow, completely, and, toenails, require, twelve, to, eighteen, months, actual, growth, rate, is, dependent, upon, age, sex, season, exercise, level, diet, and, hereditary, factors, the, longest, female, nails, known, ever, to, have, existed, measured, a, total, of, 8, 65, m, 28, ft, 4, 5, in, contrary, to, popular, belief, nails, do, not, continue, to, grow, after, death, the, skin, dehydrates, and, tightens, making, the, nails, and, hair, appear, to, grow, the, nail, is, often, considered, an, impermeable, barrier, but, this, is, not, true, in, fact, it, is, much, more, permeable, than, the, skin, and, the, composition, of, the, nail, includes, 7, 12, water, this, permeability, has, implications, for, penetration, by, harmful, and, medicinal, substances, in, particular, cosmetics, applied, to, the, nails, can, pose, a, risk, water, can, penetrate, the, nail, as, can, many, other, substances, including, paraquat, a, fast, acting, herbicide, that, is, harmful, to, humans, urea, which, is, often, an, ingredient, in, creams, and, lotions, meant, for, use, on, hands, and, fingers, and, several, fungicidal, agents, such, as, salicylic, acid, miconazole, branded, monistat, natamycin, and, sodium, hypochlorite, which, is, the, active, ingredient, in, common, household, bleach, but, usually, only, in, 2, 3, concentration, healthcare, and, pre, hospital, care, providers, emts, or, paramedics, often, use, the, fingernail, beds, as, a, cursory, indicator, of, distal, tissue, perfusion, of, individuals, who, may, be, dehydrated, or, in, shock, however, this, test, is, not, considered, reliable, in, adults, this, is, known, as, the, crt, or, blanch, test, the, fingernail, bed, is, briefly, depressed, to, turn, the, nail, bed, white, when, the, pressure, is, released, the, normal, pink, colour, should, be, restored, within, a, second, or, two, delayed, return, to, pink, color, can, be, an, indicator, of, certain, shock, states, such, as, hypovolemia, nail, growth, record, can, show, the, history, of, recent, health, and, physiological, imbalances, and, has, been, used, as, a, diagnostic, tool, since, ancient, times, deep, horizontally, transverse, grooves, known, as, beau, s, lines, may, form, across, the, nails, horizontal, not, along, the, nail, from, cuticle, to, tip, these, lines, are, usually, a, natural, consequence, of, aging, although, they, may, result, from, disease, discoloration, thinning, thickening, brittleness, splitting, grooves, mees, lines, small, white, spots, receded, lunula, clubbing, convex, flatness, and, spooning, concave, can, indicate, illness, in, other, areas, of, the, body, nutrient, deficiencies, drug, reaction, or, poisoning, or, merely, local, injury, nails, can, also, become, thickened, onychogryphosis, loosened, onycholysis, infected, with, fungus, onychomycosis, or, degenerate, onychodystrophy, a, common, nail, disorder, is, an, ingrowing, toenail, onychocryptosis, dna, profiling, is, a, technique, employed, by, forensic, scientists, on, hair, fingernails, toenails, etc, the, best, way, to, care, for, nails, is, to, trim, them, regularly, filing, is, also, recommended, as, to, keep, nails, from, becoming, too, rough, and, to, remove, any, small, bumps, or, ridges, that, may, cause, the, nail, to, get, tangled, up, in, materials, such, as, cloth, bluish, or, purple, fingernail, beds, may, be, a, symptom, of, peripheral, cyanosis, which, indicates, oxygen, deprivation, nails, can, dry, out, just, like, skin, they, can, also, peel, break, and, be, infected, toe, infections, for, instance, can, be, caused, or, exacerbated, by, dirty, socks, specific, types, of, aggressive, exercise, long, distance, running, tight, footwear, and, walking, unprotected, in, an, unclean, environment, common, organisms, causing, nail, infections, include, yeasts, and, molds, particularly, dermatophytes, nail, tools, used, by, different, people, may, transmit, infections, standard, hygiene, and, sanitation, procedures, avoid, transmission, in, some, cases, gel, and, cream, cuticle, removers, can, be, used, instead, of, cuticle, scissors, nail, disease, can, be, very, subtle, and, should, be, evaluated, by, a, dermatologist, with, a, focus, in, this, particular, area, of, medicine, however, most, times, it, is, a, nail, stylist, who, will, note, a, subtle, change, in, nail, disease, inherited, accessory, nail, of, the, fifth, toe, occurs, where, the, toenail, of, the, smallest, toe, is, separated, forming, a, smaller, sixth, toenail, in, the, outer, corner, of, the, nail, like, any, other, nail, it, can, be, cut, using, a, nail, clipper, biotin, rich, foods, and, supplements, may, help, strengthen, brittle, fingernails, vitamin, a, is, an, essential, micronutrient, for, vision, reproduction, cell, and, tissue, differentiation, and, immune, function, vitamin, d, and, calcium, work, together, in, cases, of, maintaining, homeostasis, creating, muscle, contraction, transmission, of, nerve, pulses, blood, clotting, and, membrane, structure, a, lack, of, vitamin, a, vitamin, d, or, calcium, can, cause, dryness, and, brittleness, insufficient, vitamin, b12, can, lead, to, excessive, dryness, darkened, nails, and, rounded, or, curved, nail, ends, insufficient, intake, of, both, vitamin, a, and, b, results, in, fragile, nails, with, horizontal, and, vertical, ridges, some, over, the, counter, vitamin, supplements, such, as, certain, multivitamins, and, biotin, may, help, in, growth, of, strong, nails, although, this, is, quite, subjective, both, vitamin, b12, and, folate, play, a, role, in, red, blood, cell, production, and, oxygen, transportation, to, nail, cells, inadequacies, can, result, in, discoloration, of, the, nails, diminished, dietary, intake, of, omega, 3, fatty, acids, may, contribute, to, dry, and, brittle, nails, protein, is, a, building, material, for, new, nails, therefore, low, dietary, protein, intake, may, cause, anemia, and, the, resultant, reduced, hemoglobin, in, the, blood, filling, the, capillaries, of, the, nail, bed, reflects, varying, amounts, of, light, incident, on, the, nail, matrix, resulting, in, lighter, shades, of, pink, ultimately, resulting, in, white, nail, beds, when, the, hemoglobin, is, very, low, when, hemoglobin, is, close, to, 15, or, 16, grams, most, of, the, spectrum, of, light, is, absorbed, and, only, the, pink, color, is, reflected, back, and, the, nails, look, pink, essential, fatty, acids, play, a, large, role, in, healthy, skin, as, well, as, nails, splitting, and, flaking, of, nails, may, be, due, to, a, lack, of, linoleic, acid, iron, deficiency, anemia, can, lead, to, a, pale, color, along, with, a, thin, brittle, ridged, texture, iron, deficiency, in, general, may, cause, the, nails, to, become, flat, or, concave, rather, than, convex, as, oxygen, is, needed, for, healthy, nails, an, iron, deficiency, or, anemia, can, lead, to, vertical, ridges, or, concavity, in, the, nails, rdas, for, iron, vary, considerably, depending, on, age, and, gender, the, recommendation, for, men, is, 8, mg, per, day, while, that, of, women, aged, 19, 50, is, 18, mg, per, day, after, women, hit, age, 50, or, go, through, menopause, their, iron, needs, drop, to, 8, mg, daily, manicures, for, the, hands, and, pedicures, for, the, feet, are, health, and, cosmetic, procedures, to, groom, trim, and, paint, the, nails, and, manage, calluses, they, require, various, tools, such, as, cuticle, scissors, nail, scissors, nail, clippers, and, nail, files, artificial, nails, can, also, be, fixed, onto, real, nails, for, cosmetic, purposes, a, person, whose, occupation, is, to, cut, shape, and, care, for, nails, as, well, as, to, apply, overlays, such, as, acrylic, and, uv, gel, is, sometimes, called, a, nail, stylist, the, place, where, a, nail, stylist, works, may, be, a, nail, salon, or, nail, shop, or, nail, bar, acrylic, nails, are, made, out, of, acrylic, glass, pmma, when, it, is, mixed, with, a, liquid, monomer, usually, ethyl, methacrylate, mixed, with, some, inhibitor, it, forms, a, malleable, bead, this, mixture, begins, to, cure, immediately, continuing, until, completely, solid, in, minutes, acrylic, nails, can, last, up, to, 21, days, but, can, last, longer, with, touch, ups, to, give, acrylic, nails, color, gel, polish, nail, polish, and, dip, powders, can, be, applied, painting, the, nails, with, colored, nail, polish, also, called, nail, lacquer, and, nail, varnish, to, improve, the, appearance, is, a, common, practice, dating, back, to, at, least, 3000, b, c, gel, nails, can, be, utilized, in, order, to, create, artificial, nail, extensions, but, can, also, be, used, like, nail, polish, they, are, hardened, using, ultraviolet, light, they, last, longer, than, regular, nail, polish, and, do, not, chip, they, have, a, high, gloss, finish, and, last, for, two, to, three, weeks, nail, wraps, are, formed, by, cutting, pieces, of, fiberglass, linen, silk, fabric, or, another, material, to, fit, on, the, surface, of, the, nail, or, a, tip, attached, prior, to, be, sealed, onto, the, nail, plate, with, a, layer, of, resin, or, glue, they, do, not, damage, the, nail, and, also, provide, strength, to, the, nail, but, are, not, used, to, lengthen, it, it, can, also, be, used, to, fix, broken, nails, the, treatment, is, however, more, expensive, with, the, dip, powder, method, a, clear, liquid, is, brushed, onto, a, nail, and, the, nail, is, then, placed, into, pigmented, powder, dip, nails, tend, to, last, about, a, month, 2, 3, weeks, longer, than, gel, and, acrylic, nails, it, can, be, worn, on, natural, nails, or, with, tips, to, create, an, artificial, nail, dip, powder, nails, do, not, require, any, uv, led, light, to, be, cured, instead, they, are, sealed, using, an, activator, the, quickest, way, to, remove, dip, powder, is, to, drill, clip, off, or, buff, out, layers, of, the, powder, so, when, they, are, soaking, in, acetone, they, slide, right, off, guinness, world, records, began, tracking, record, fingernail, lengths, in, 1955, when, a, chinese, priest, was, listed, as, having, fingernails, 1, foot, 10, 75, inches, 57, 79, cm, long, the, current, record, holder, for, men, according, to, guinness, is, shridhar, chillal, from, india, who, set, the, record, in, 1998, with, a, total, of, 20, feet, 2, 25, inches, 615, 32, cm, of, nails, on, his, left, hand, his, longest, nail, on, his, thumb, was, 4, feet, 9, 6, inches, 146, 3, cm, long, the, former, record, holder, for, women, was, lee, redmond, of, the, u, s, who, set, the, record, in, 2001, and, as, of, 2008, had, nails, with, a, total, length, on, both, hands, of, 28, feet, 850, cm, with, the, longest, nail, on, her, right, thumb, at, 2, feet, 11, inches, 89, cm, however, as, of, 2022, the, record, for, woman, is, held, by, diane, armstrong, from, minneapolis, the, nail, is, an, unguis, meaning, a, keratin, structure, at, the, end, of, a, digit, other, examples, of, ungues, include, the, claw, hoof, and, talon, the, nails, of, primates, and, the, hooves, of, running, mammals, evolved, from, the, claws, of, earlier, animals, in, contrast, to, nails, claws, are, typically, curved, ventrally, downwards, in, animals, and, compressed, sideways, they, serve, a, multitude, of, functions, including, climbing, digging, and, fighting, and, have, undergone, numerous, adaptive, changes, in, different, animal, taxa, claws, are, pointed, at, their, ends, and, are, composed, of, two, layers, a, thick, deep, layer, and, a, superficial, hardened, layer, which, serves, a, protective, function, the, underlying, bone, is, a, virtual, mold, of, the, overlying, horny, structure, and, therefore, has, the, same, shape, as, the, claw, or, nail, compared, to, claws, nails, are, flat, less, curved, and, do, not, extend, far, beyond, the, tip, of, the, digits, the, ends, of, the, nails, usually, consist, only, of, the, superficial, hardened, layer, and, are, not, pointed, like, claws, with, only, a, few, exceptions, primates, retain, plesiomorphic, original, primitive, hands, with, five, digits, each, equipped, with, either, a, nail, or, a, claw, for, example, nearly, all, living, strepsirrhine, primates, have, nails, on, all, digits, except, the, second, toe, which, is, equipped, with, a, grooming, claw, tarsiers, have, a, grooming, claw, on, second, and, third, toes, less, commonly, known, a, grooming, claw, is, also, found, on, the, second, pedal, digit, of, owl, monkeys, aotus, titis, callicebus, and, possibly, other, new, world, monkeys, the, needle, clawed, bushbaby, euoticus, has, keeled, nails, the, thumb, and, the, first, and, the, second, toes, have, claws, featuring, a, central, ridge, that, ends, in, a, needle, like, tip, a, study, of, the, fingertip, morphology, of, four, small, bodied, new, world, monkey, species, indicated, a, correlation, between, increasing, small, branch, foraging, and, this, suggests, that, whereas, claws, are, useful, on, large, diameter, branches, wide, fingertips, with, nails, and, epidermal, ridges, were, required, for, habitual, locomotion, on, small, diameter, branches, it, also, indicates, keel, shaped, nails, of, callitrichines, a, family, of, new, world, monkeys, is, a, derived, postural, adaptation, rather, than, retained, ancestral, condition
