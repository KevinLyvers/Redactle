vombatiformes, phalangeriformes, macropodiformes, diprotodontia, d, a, p, r, o, t, d, n, t, i, from, greek, two, forward, teeth, is, the, largest, extant, order, of, marsupials, with, about, 155, species, including, the, kangaroos, wallabies, possums, koala, wombats, and, many, others, extinct, diprotodonts, include, the, hippopotamus, sized, diprotodon, and, thylacoleo, the, so, called, marsupial, lion, living, diprotodonts, are, almost, all, herbivores, as, were, most, of, those, that, are, now, extinct, a, few, insectivorous, and, omnivorous, diprotodonts, are, known, and, the, potoroidae, are, almost, unique, among, vertebrates, in, being, largely, fungivorous, but, these, seem, to, have, arisen, as, relatively, recent, adaptations, from, the, mainstream, herbivorous, lifestyle, the, extinct, thylacoleonids, marsupial, lions, are, the, only, known, group, to, have, exhibited, carnivory, on, a, large, scale, diprotodonts, are, restricted, to, australasia, the, earliest, known, fossils, date, to, the, late, oligocene, but, their, genesis, certainly, lies, earlier, than, this, as, large, gaps, occur, in, australia, s, fossil, record, with, virtually, no, fossil, record, at, all, in, geologically, active, new, guinea, the, great, diversity, of, known, oligocene, diprotodonts, suggests, the, order, began, to, diverge, well, beforehand, many, of, the, largest, and, least, athletic, diprotodonts, along, with, a, wide, range, of, other, australian, megafauna, became, extinct, when, humans, first, arrived, in, australia, about, 50, 000, years, ago, their, extinction, possibly, occurred, as, a, direct, result, of, hunting, but, was, more, probably, a, result, of, widespread, habitat, changes, brought, about, by, human, activities, notably, the, use, of, fire, two, key, anatomical, features, in, combination, identify, diprotodontia, members, of, the, order, are, first, diprotodont, meaning, two, front, teeth, they, have, a, pair, of, large, procumbent, incisors, on, the, lower, jaw, a, common, feature, of, many, early, groups, of, mammals, and, mammaliforms, the, diprotodont, jaw, is, short, usually, with, three, pairs, of, upper, incisors, wombats, like, rodents, have, only, one, pair, and, no, lower, canines, the, second, trait, distinguishing, diprotodonts, is, syndactyly, a, fusing, of, the, second, and, third, digits, of, the, foot, up, to, the, base, of, the, claws, which, leaves, the, claws, themselves, separate, digit, five, is, usually, absent, and, digit, four, is, often, greatly, enlarged, syndactyly, is, not, particularly, common, though, the, australian, omnivorous, marsupials, share, it, and, is, generally, posited, as, an, adaptation, to, assist, in, climbing, many, modern, diprotodonts, however, are, strictly, terrestrial, and, have, evolved, further, adaptations, to, their, feet, to, better, suit, this, lifestyle, this, makes, the, history, of, the, tree, kangaroos, particularly, convoluted, it, appears, that, the, animals, were, arboreal, at, some, time, in, the, far, distant, past, moving, afterward, to, the, ground, gaining, long, kangaroo, like, feet, in, the, process, before, returning, to, the, trees, where, they, further, developed, a, shortening, and, broadening, of, the, hind, feet, and, a, novel, climbing, method, the, earliest, known, fossil, of, diprotodontia, dates, back, to, the, late, oligocene, 23, 03, 28, 4, million, years, ago, and, the, earliest, identifiable, species, is, hypsiprymnodon, bartholomaii, from, the, early, miocene, phascolarctidae, vombatidae, burramyidae, phalangeridae, acrobatidae, tarsipedidae, petauridae, pseudocheiridae, hypsiprymnodontidae, potoroidae, macropodidae, until, recently, only, two, suborders, in, diprotodontia, were, noted, vombatiformes, which, encompassed, the, wombats, and, koala, and, phalangerida, which, contained, all, other, families, kirsch, et, al, 1997, split, the, families, into, three, suborders, in, addition, the, six, phalangeriformes, families, are, split, into, two, superfamilies, the, macropodiformes, are, probably, nested, within, the, phalangeriformes, though, whether, they, are, sister, to, phalangeroidea, or, petauroidea, is, debated, order, diprotodontia, means, extinct, family, genus, or, species
