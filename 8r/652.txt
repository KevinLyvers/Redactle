and, see, text, a, passerine, p, s, r, a, n, is, any, bird, of, the, order, passeriformes, p, s, r, f, r, m, i, z, from, latin, passer, sparrow, and, formis, shaped, which, includes, more, than, half, of, all, bird, species, sometimes, known, as, perching, birds, passerines, generally, have, an, anisodactyl, arrangement, of, their, toes, three, pointing, forward, and, one, back, which, facilitates, perching, with, more, than, 140, families, and, some, 6, 500, identified, species, passeriformes, is, the, largest, order, of, birds, and, among, the, most, diverse, clades, of, terrestrial, vertebrates, representing, 60, of, birds, passerines, are, divided, into, three, suborders, acanthisitti, new, zealand, wrens, tyranni, composed, mostly, of, south, american, suboscines, and, passeri, oscines, or, songbirds, passerines, originated, in, the, southern, hemisphere, around, 60, million, years, ago, most, passerines, are, insectivorous, or, omnivorous, and, eat, both, insects, and, fruit, or, seeds, the, terms, passerine, and, passeriformes, are, derived, from, the, scientific, name, of, the, house, sparrow, passer, domesticus, and, ultimately, from, the, latin, term, passer, which, refers, to, sparrows, and, similar, small, birds, the, order, is, divided, into, three, suborders, tyranni, suboscines, passeri, oscines, or, songbirds, and, the, basal, acanthisitti, oscines, have, the, best, control, of, their, syrinx, muscles, among, birds, producing, a, wide, range, of, songs, and, other, vocalizations, though, some, of, them, such, as, the, crows, do, not, sound, musical, to, human, beings, some, such, as, the, lyrebird, are, accomplished, mimics, the, new, zealand, wrens, are, tiny, birds, restricted, to, new, zealand, at, least, in, modern, times, they, were, long, placed, in, passeri, most, passerines, are, smaller, than, typical, members, of, other, avian, orders, the, heaviest, and, altogether, largest, passerines, are, the, thick, billed, raven, and, the, larger, races, of, common, raven, each, exceeding, 1, 5, kg, 3, 3, lb, and, 70, cm, 28, in, the, superb, lyrebird, and, some, birds, of, paradise, due, to, very, long, tails, or, tail, coverts, are, longer, overall, the, smallest, passerine, is, the, short, tailed, pygmy, tyrant, at, 6, 5, cm, 2, 6, in, and, 4, 2, g, 0, 15, oz, the, foot, of, a, passerine, has, three, toes, directed, forward, and, one, toe, directed, backward, called, anisodactyl, arrangement, the, hind, toe, hallux, is, long, and, joins, the, leg, at, approximately, the, same, level, as, the, front, toes, this, arrangement, enables, passerine, birds, to, easily, perch, upright, on, branches, the, toes, have, no, webbing, or, joining, but, in, some, cotingas, the, second, and, third, toes, are, united, at, their, basal, third, the, leg, of, passerine, birds, contains, an, additional, special, adaptation, for, perching, a, tendon, in, the, rear, of, the, leg, running, from, the, underside, of, the, toes, to, the, muscle, behind, the, tibiotarsus, will, automatically, be, pulled, and, tighten, when, the, leg, bends, causing, the, foot, to, curl, and, become, stiff, when, the, bird, lands, on, a, branch, this, enables, passerines, to, sleep, while, perching, without, falling, off, most, passerine, birds, have, 12, tail, feathers, but, the, superb, lyrebird, has, 16, and, several, spinetails, in, the, family, furnariidae, have, 10, 8, or, even, 6, as, is, the, case, of, des, murs, s, wiretail, species, adapted, to, tree, trunk, climbing, such, as, treecreepers, and, woodcreeper, have, stiff, tail, feathers, that, are, used, as, props, during, climbing, extremely, long, tails, used, as, sexual, ornaments, are, shown, by, species, in, different, families, a, well, known, example, is, the, long, tailed, widowbird, the, chicks, of, passerines, are, altricial, blind, featherless, and, helpless, when, hatched, from, their, eggs, hence, the, chicks, require, extensive, parental, care, most, passerines, lay, colored, eggs, in, contrast, with, nonpasserines, most, of, whose, eggs, are, white, except, in, some, ground, nesting, groups, such, as, charadriiformes, and, nightjars, where, camouflage, is, necessary, and, in, some, parasitic, cuckoos, which, match, the, passerine, host, s, egg, the, vinous, throated, parrotbill, has, two, egg, colors, white, and, blue, to, deter, the, brood, parasitic, common, cuckoo, clutches, vary, considerably, in, size, some, larger, passerines, of, australia, such, as, lyrebirds, and, scrub, robins, lay, only, a, single, egg, most, smaller, passerines, in, warmer, climates, lay, between, two, and, five, while, in, the, higher, latitudes, of, the, northern, hemisphere, hole, nesting, species, like, tits, can, lay, up, to, a, dozen, and, other, species, around, five, or, six, the, family, viduidae, do, not, build, their, own, nests, instead, they, lay, eggs, in, other, birds, nests, the, passeriformes, contain, several, groups, of, brood, parasites, such, as, the, viduas, cuckoo, finches, and, the, cowbirds, the, evolutionary, history, of, the, passerine, families, and, the, relationships, among, them, remained, rather, mysterious, until, the, late, 20th, century, in, many, cases, passerine, families, were, grouped, together, on, the, basis, of, morphological, similarities, that, it, is, now, believed, are, the, result, of, convergent, evolution, not, a, close, genetic, relationship, for, example, the, wrens, of, the, americas, and, eurasia, those, of, australia, and, those, of, new, zealand, look, superficially, similar, and, behave, in, similar, ways, yet, belong, to, three, far, flung, branches, of, the, passerine, family, tree, they, are, as, unrelated, as, it, is, possible, to, be, while, remaining, passeriformes, advances, in, molecular, biology, and, improved, paleobiogeographical, data, gradually, are, revealing, a, clearer, picture, of, passerine, origins, and, evolution, that, reconciles, molecular, affinities, the, constraints, of, morphology, and, the, specifics, of, the, fossil, record, the, first, passerines, are, now, thought, to, have, evolved, in, the, southern, hemisphere, in, the, late, paleocene, or, early, eocene, around, 50, million, years, ago, the, initial, diversification, of, passerines, coincides, with, the, separation, of, the, southern, continents, in, the, early, eocene, the, new, zealand, wrens, are, the, first, to, become, isolated, in, zealandia, and, the, second, split, involved, the, origin, of, the, tyranni, in, south, america, and, the, passeri, in, the, australian, continent, the, passeri, experienced, a, great, radiation, of, forms, in, australia, a, major, branch, of, the, passeri, the, parvorder, passerida, dispersed, into, eurasia, and, africa, about, 40, million, years, ago, where, they, experienced, further, radiation, of, new, lineages, this, eventually, led, to, three, major, passerida, lineages, comprising, about, 4, 000, species, which, in, addition, to, the, corvida, and, numerous, minor, lineages, make, up, songbird, diversity, today, extensive, biogeographical, mixing, happens, with, northern, forms, returning, to, the, south, southern, forms, moving, north, and, so, on, perching, bird, osteology, especially, of, the, limb, bones, is, rather, diagnostic, however, the, early, fossil, record, is, poor, because, passerines, are, relatively, small, and, their, delicate, bones, do, not, preserve, well, queensland, museum, specimens, f20688, carpometacarpus, and, f24685, tibiotarsus, from, murgon, queensland, are, fossil, bone, fragments, initially, assigned, to, passeriformes, however, the, material, is, too, fragmentary, and, their, affinities, have, been, questioned, several, more, recent, fossils, from, the, oligocene, of, europe, such, as, wieslochia, jamna, resoviaornis, and, crosnoornis, are, more, complete, and, definitely, represent, early, passeriforms, and, have, been, found, to, belong, to, a, variety, of, modern, and, extinct, lineages, from, the, bathans, formation, at, the, manuherikia, river, in, otago, new, zealand, mnz, s42815, a, distal, right, tarsometatarsus, of, a, tui, sized, bird, and, several, bones, of, at, least, one, species, of, saddleback, sized, bird, have, recently, been, described, these, date, from, the, early, to, middle, miocene, awamoan, to, lillburnian, 19, 16, mya, in, europe, perching, birds, are, not, too, uncommon, in, the, fossil, record, from, the, oligocene, onward, belonging, to, several, lineages, that, suboscines, expanded, much, beyond, their, region, of, origin, is, proven, by, several, fossils, from, germany, such, as, a, presumed, broadbill, eurylaimidae, humerus, fragment, from, the, early, miocene, roughly, 20, mya, of, wintershof, germany, the, late, oligocene, carpometacarpus, from, france, listed, above, and, wieslochia, among, others, extant, passeri, super, families, were, quite, distinct, by, that, time, and, are, known, since, about, 12, 13, mya, when, modern, genera, were, present, in, the, corvoidean, and, basal, songbirds, the, modern, diversity, of, passerida, genera, is, known, mostly, from, the, late, miocene, onward, and, into, the, pliocene, about, 10, 2, mya, pleistocene, and, early, holocene, lagerst, tten, 1, 8, mya, yield, numerous, extant, species, and, many, yield, almost, nothing, but, extant, species, or, their, chronospecies, and, paleosubspecies, in, the, americas, the, fossil, record, is, more, scant, before, the, pleistocene, from, which, several, still, existing, families, are, documented, apart, from, the, indeterminable, macn, sc, 1411, pinturas, early, middle, miocene, of, santa, cruz, province, argentina, an, extinct, lineage, of, perching, birds, has, been, described, from, the, late, miocene, of, california, united, states, the, palaeoscinidae, with, the, single, genus, palaeoscinis, palaeostruthus, eurius, pliocene, of, florida, probably, belongs, to, an, extant, family, most, likely, passeroidean, acanthisitti, new, zealand, wrens, 1, family, containing, 7, species, only, 2, extant, tyranni, suboscines, 16, families, containing, 1, 356, species, passeri, oscines, 125, families, containing, 5, 158, species, the, passeriformes, is, currently, divided, into, three, suborders, acanthisitti, new, zealand, wrens, tyranni, suboscines, and, passeri, oscines, or, songbirds, the, passeri, is, now, subdivided, into, two, major, groups, recognized, now, as, corvides, and, passerida, respectively, containing, the, large, superfamilies, corvoidea, and, meliphagoidea, as, well, as, minor, lineages, and, the, superfamilies, sylvioidea, muscicapoidea, and, passeroidea, but, this, arrangement, has, been, found, to, be, oversimplified, since, the, mid, 2000s, studies, have, investigated, the, phylogeny, of, the, passeriformes, and, found, that, many, families, from, australasia, traditionally, included, in, the, corvoidea, actually, represent, more, basal, lineages, within, oscines, likewise, the, traditional, three, superfamily, arrangement, within, the, passeri, has, turned, out, to, be, far, more, complex, and, will, require, changes, in, classification, major, wastebin, families, such, as, the, old, world, warblers, and, old, world, babblers, have, turned, out, to, be, paraphyletic, and, are, being, rearranged, several, taxa, turned, out, to, represent, highly, distinct, lineages, so, new, families, had, to, be, established, some, of, theirs, like, the, stitchbird, of, new, zealand, and, the, eurasian, bearded, reedling, monotypic, with, only, one, living, species, in, the, passeri, alone, a, number, of, minor, lineages, will, eventually, be, recognized, as, distinct, superfamilies, for, example, the, kinglets, constitute, a, single, genus, with, less, than, 10, species, today, but, seem, to, have, been, among, the, first, perching, bird, lineages, to, diverge, as, the, group, spread, across, eurasia, no, particularly, close, relatives, of, theirs, have, been, found, among, comprehensive, studies, of, the, living, passeri, though, they, might, be, fairly, close, to, some, little, studied, tropical, asian, groups, nuthatches, wrens, and, their, closest, relatives, are, currently, grouped, in, a, distinct, super, family, certhioidea, this, list, is, in, taxonomic, order, placing, related, families, next, to, one, another, the, families, listed, are, those, recognised, by, the, international, ornithologists, union, ioc, the, order, and, the, division, into, infraorders, parvorders, and, superfamilies, follows, the, phylogenetic, analysis, published, by, carl, oliveros, and, colleagues, in, 2019, the, relationships, between, the, families, in, the, suborder, tyranni, suboscines, were, all, well, determined, but, some, of, the, nodes, in, passeri, oscines, or, songbirds, were, unclear, owing, to, the, rapid, splitting, of, the, lineages, infraorder, eurylaimides, old, world, suboscines, infraorder, tyrannides, new, world, suboscines, parvorder, furnariida, parvorder, tyrannida, relationships, between, living, passeriformes, families, based, on, the, phylogenetic, analysis, of, oliveros, et, al, 2019, some, terminals, have, been, renamed, to, reflect, families, recognised,
