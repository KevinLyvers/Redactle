tyrannosaurus, t, r, n, s, r, s, t, a, is, a, genus, of, large, theropod, dinosaur, the, type, species, tyrannosaurus, rex, rex, meaning, king, in, latin, often, shortened, to, t, rex, or, colloquially, t, rex, is, one, of, the, best, represented, theropods, it, lived, throughout, what, is, now, western, north, america, on, what, was, then, an, island, continent, known, as, laramidia, tyrannosaurus, had, a, much, wider, range, than, other, tyrannosaurids, fossils, are, found, in, a, variety, of, rock, formations, dating, to, the, latest, campanian, maastrichtian, ages, of, the, late, cretaceous, period, 72, 7, to, 66, million, years, ago, it, was, the, last, known, member, of, the, tyrannosaurids, and, among, the, last, non, avian, dinosaurs, to, exist, before, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, like, other, tyrannosaurids, tyrannosaurus, was, a, bipedal, carnivore, with, a, massive, skull, balanced, by, a, long, heavy, tail, relative, to, its, large, and, powerful, hind, limbs, the, forelimbs, of, tyrannosaurus, were, short, but, unusually, powerful, for, their, size, and, they, had, two, clawed, digits, the, most, complete, specimen, measures, 12, 3, 12, 4, m, 40, 41, ft, in, length, but, according, to, most, modern, estimates, tyrannosaurus, could, have, exceeded, sizes, of, 13, m, 43, ft, in, length, 3, 7, 4, m, 12, 13, ft, in, hip, height, and, 8, 8, t, 8, 7, long, tons, 9, 7, short, tons, in, mass, although, some, other, theropods, might, have, rivaled, or, exceeded, tyrannosaurus, in, size, it, is, still, among, the, largest, known, land, predators, with, its, estimated, bite, force, being, the, largest, among, all, terrestrial, animals, by, far, the, largest, carnivore, in, its, environment, tyrannosaurus, rex, was, most, likely, an, apex, predator, preying, upon, hadrosaurs, juvenile, armored, herbivores, like, ceratopsians, and, ankylosaurs, and, possibly, sauropods, some, experts, have, suggested, the, dinosaur, was, primarily, a, scavenger, the, question, of, whether, tyrannosaurus, was, an, apex, predator, or, a, pure, scavenger, was, among, the, longest, debates, in, paleontology, most, paleontologists, today, accept, that, tyrannosaurus, was, both, an, active, predator, and, a, scavenger, specimens, of, tyrannosaurus, rex, include, some, that, are, nearly, complete, skeletons, soft, tissue, and, proteins, have, been, reported, in, at, least, one, of, these, specimens, the, abundance, of, fossil, material, has, allowed, significant, research, into, many, aspects, of, its, biology, including, its, life, history, and, biomechanics, the, feeding, habits, physiology, and, potential, speed, of, tyrannosaurus, rex, are, a, few, subjects, of, debate, its, taxonomy, is, also, controversial, as, some, scientists, consider, tarbosaurus, bataar, from, asia, to, be, a, third, tyrannosaurus, species, while, others, maintain, tarbosaurus, is, a, separate, genus, several, other, genera, of, north, american, tyrannosaurids, have, also, been, synonymized, with, tyrannosaurus, at, present, two, species, of, tyrannosaurus, are, considered, valid, the, type, species, t, rex, and, the, earlier, and, more, recently, discovered, t, mcraeensis, as, the, archetypal, theropod, tyrannosaurus, has, been, one, of, the, best, known, dinosaurs, since, the, early, 20th, century, and, has, been, featured, in, film, advertising, postal, stamps, and, many, other, media, a, tooth, from, what, is, now, documented, as, a, tyrannosaurus, rex, was, found, in, july, 1874, upon, south, table, mountain, colorado, by, jarvis, hall, colorado, student, peter, t, dotson, under, the, auspices, of, prof, arthur, lakes, near, golden, colorado, in, the, early, 1890s, john, bell, hatcher, collected, postcranial, elements, in, eastern, wyoming, the, fossils, were, believed, to, be, from, the, large, species, ornithomimus, grandis, now, deinodon, but, are, now, considered, t, rex, remains, in, 1892, edward, drinker, cope, found, two, vertebral, fragments, of, a, large, dinosaur, cope, believed, the, fragments, belonged, to, an, agathaumid, ceratopsid, dinosaur, and, named, them, manospondylus, gigas, meaning, giant, porous, vertebra, in, reference, to, the, numerous, openings, for, blood, vessels, he, found, in, the, bone, the, m, gigas, remains, were, in, 1907, identified, by, hatcher, as, those, of, a, theropod, rather, than, a, ceratopsid, henry, fairfield, osborn, recognized, the, similarity, between, manospondylus, gigas, and, t, rex, as, early, as, 1917, by, which, time, the, second, vertebra, had, been, lost, owing, to, the, fragmentary, nature, of, the, manospondylus, vertebrae, osborn, did, not, synonymize, the, two, genera, instead, considering, the, older, genus, indeterminate, in, june, 2000, the, black, hills, institute, found, around, 10, of, a, tyrannosaurus, skeleton, bhi, 6248, at, a, site, that, might, have, been, the, original, m, gigas, locality, barnum, brown, assistant, curator, of, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, found, the, first, partial, skeleton, of, t, rex, in, eastern, wyoming, in, 1900, brown, found, another, partial, skeleton, in, the, hell, creek, formation, in, montana, in, 1902, comprising, approximately, 34, fossilized, bones, writing, at, the, time, brown, said, quarry, no, 1, contains, the, femur, pubes, humerus, three, vertebrae, and, two, undetermined, bones, of, a, large, carnivorous, dinosaur, not, described, by, marsh, i, have, never, seen, anything, like, it, from, the, cretaceous, henry, fairfield, osborn, president, of, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, named, the, second, skeleton, t, rex, in, 1905, the, generic, name, is, derived, from, the, greek, words, tyrannos, meaning, tyrant, and, sauros, meaning, lizard, osborn, used, the, latin, word, rex, meaning, king, for, the, specific, name, the, full, binomial, therefore, translates, to, tyrant, lizard, the, king, or, king, tyrant, lizard, emphasizing, the, animal, s, size, and, presumed, dominance, over, other, species, of, the, time, osborn, named, the, other, specimen, dynamosaurus, imperiosus, in, a, paper, in, 1905, in, 1906, osborn, recognized, that, the, two, skeletons, were, from, the, same, species, and, selected, tyrannosaurus, as, the, preferred, name, in, 1941, the, t, rex, type, specimen, was, sold, to, the, carnegie, museum, of, natural, history, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, for, 7, 000, the, original, dynamosaurus, material, now, resides, in, the, collections, of, the, natural, history, museum, london, dynamosaurus, would, later, be, honored, by, the, 2018, description, of, another, species, of, tyrannosaurid, by, andrew, mcdonald, and, colleagues, dynamoterror, dynastes, whose, name, was, chosen, in, reference, to, the, 1905, name, as, it, had, been, a, childhood, favorite, of, mcdonald, s, from, the, 1910s, through, the, end, of, the, 1950s, barnum, s, discoveries, remained, the, only, specimens, of, tyrannosaurus, as, the, great, depression, and, wars, kept, many, paleontologists, out, of, the, field, beginning, in, the, 1960s, there, was, renewed, interest, in, tyrannosaurus, resulting, in, the, recovery, of, 42, skeletons, 5, 80, complete, by, bone, count, from, western, north, america, in, 1967, dr, william, macmannis, located, and, recovered, the, skeleton, named, mor, 008, which, is, 15, complete, by, bone, count, and, has, a, reconstructed, skull, displayed, at, the, museum, of, the, rockies, the, 1990s, saw, numerous, discoveries, with, nearly, twice, as, many, finds, as, in, all, previous, years, including, two, of, the, most, complete, skeletons, found, to, date, sue, and, stan, sue, hendrickson, an, amateur, paleontologist, discovered, the, most, complete, approximately, 85, and, largest, tyrannosaurus, skeleton, in, the, hell, creek, formation, on, august, 12, 1990, the, specimen, sue, named, after, the, discoverer, was, the, object, of, a, legal, battle, over, its, ownership, in, 1997, the, litigation, was, settled, in, favor, of, maurice, williams, the, original, land, owner, the, fossil, collection, was, purchased, by, the, field, museum, of, natural, history, at, auction, for, 7, 6, million, making, it, the, most, expensive, dinosaur, skeleton, until, the, sale, of, stan, for, 31, 8, million, in, 2020, from, 1998, to, 1999, field, museum, of, natural, history, staff, spent, over, 25, 000, hours, taking, the, rock, off, the, bones, the, bones, were, then, shipped, to, new, jersey, where, the, mount, was, constructed, then, shipped, back, to, chicago, for, the, final, assembly, the, mounted, skeleton, opened, to, the, public, on, may, 17, 2000, in, the, field, museum, of, natural, history, a, study, of, this, specimen, s, fossilized, bones, showed, that, sue, reached, full, size, at, age, 19, and, died, at, the, age, of, 28, the, longest, estimated, life, of, any, tyrannosaur, known, another, tyrannosaurus, nicknamed, stan, bhi, 3033, in, honor, of, amateur, paleontologist, stan, sacrison, was, recovered, from, the, hell, creek, formation, in, 1992, stan, is, the, second, most, complete, skeleton, found, with, 199, bones, recovered, representing, 70, of, the, total, this, tyrannosaur, also, had, many, bone, pathologies, including, broken, and, healed, ribs, a, broken, and, healed, neck, and, a, substantial, hole, in, the, back, of, its, head, about, the, size, of, a, tyrannosaurus, tooth, in, 1998, 20, year, old, bucky, derflinger, noticed, a, t, rex, toe, exposed, above, ground, making, him, the, youngest, person, to, discover, a, tyrannosaurus, the, specimen, dubbed, bucky, in, honor, of, its, discoverer, was, a, young, adult, 3, 0, metres, 10, ft, tall, and, 11, metres, 35, ft, long, bucky, is, the, first, tyrannosaurus, to, be, found, that, preserved, a, furcula, wishbone, bucky, is, permanently, displayed, at, the, children, s, museum, of, indianapolis, in, the, summer, of, 2000, crews, organized, by, jack, horner, discovered, five, tyrannosaurus, skeletons, near, the, fort, peck, reservoir, in, 2001, a, 50, complete, skeleton, of, a, juvenile, tyrannosaurus, was, discovered, in, the, hell, creek, formation, by, a, crew, from, the, burpee, museum, of, natural, history, dubbed, jane, bmrp, 2002, 4, 1, the, find, was, thought, to, be, the, first, known, skeleton, of, a, pygmy, tyrannosaurid, nanotyrannus, but, subsequent, research, revealed, that, it, is, more, likely, a, juvenile, tyrannosaurus, and, the, most, complete, juvenile, example, known, jane, is, exhibited, at, the, burpee, museum, of, natural, history, in, 2002, a, skeleton, nicknamed, wyrex, discovered, by, amateur, collectors, dan, wells, and, don, wyrick, had, 114, bones, and, was, 38, complete, the, dig, was, concluded, over, 3, weeks, in, 2004, by, the, black, hills, institute, with, the, first, live, online, tyrannosaurus, excavation, providing, daily, reports, photos, and, video, in, 2006, montana, state, university, revealed, that, it, possessed, the, largest, tyrannosaurus, skull, yet, discovered, from, a, specimen, named, mor, 008, measuring, 5, feet, 152, cm, long, subsequent, comparisons, indicated, that, the, longest, head, was, 136, 5, centimetres, 53, 7, in, from, specimen, lacm, 23844, and, the, widest, head, was, 90, 2, centimetres, 35, 5, in, from, sue, two, isolated, fossilized, footprints, have, been, tentatively, assigned, to, t, rex, the, first, was, discovered, at, philmont, scout, ranch, new, mexico, in, 1983, by, american, geologist, charles, pillmore, originally, thought, to, belong, to, a, hadrosaurid, examination, of, the, footprint, revealed, a, large, heel, unknown, in, ornithopod, dinosaur, tracks, and, traces, of, what, may, have, been, a, hallux, the, dewclaw, like, fourth, digit, of, the, tyrannosaur, foot, the, footprint, was, published, as, the, ichnogenus, tyrannosauripus, pillmorei, in, 1994, by, martin, lockley, and, adrian, hunt, lockley, and, hunt, suggested, that, it, was, very, likely, the, track, was, made, by, a, t, rex, which, would, make, it, the, first, known, footprint, from, this, species, the, track, was, made, in, what, was, once, a, vegetated, wetland, mudflat, it, measures, 83, centimeters, 33, in, long, by, 71, centimeters, 28, in, wide, a, second, footprint, that, may, have, been, made, by, a, tyrannosaurus, was, first, reported, in, 2007, by, british, paleontologist, phil, manning, from, the, hell, creek, formation, of, montana, this, second, track, measures, 72, centimeters, 28, in, long, shorter, than, the, track, described, by, lockley, and, hunt, whether, or, not, the, track, was, made, by, tyrannosaurus, is, unclear, though, tyrannosaurus, is, the, only, large, theropod, known, to, have, existed, in, the, hell, creek, formation, a, set, of, footprints, in, glenrock, wyoming, dating, to, the, maastrichtian, stage, of, the, late, cretaceous, and, hailing, from, the, lance, formation, were, described, by, scott, persons, phil, currie, and, colleagues, in, 2016, and, are, believed, to, belong, to, either, a, juvenile, t, rex, or, the, dubious, tyrannosaurid, nanotyrannus, lancensis, from, measurements, and, based, on, the, positions, of, the, footprints, the, animal, was, believed, to, be, traveling, at, a, walking, speed, of, around, 2, 8, to, 5, miles, per, hour, and, was, estimated, to, have, a, hip, height, of, 1, 56, to, 2, 06, m, 5, 1, to, 6, 8, ft, a, follow, up, paper, appeared, in, 2017, increasing, the, speed, estimations, by, 50, 80, t, rex, was, one, of, the, largest, land, carnivores, of, all, time, one, of, its, largest, and, the, most, complete, specimens, nicknamed, sue, fmnh, pr2081, is, located, at, the, field, museum, of, natural, history, in, chicago, sue, measured, 12, 3, 12, 4, m, 40, 4, 40, 7, ft, long, was, 3, 66, 3, 96, meters, 12, 13, ft, tall, at, the, hips, and, according, to, the, most, recent, studies, using, a, variety, of, techniques, maximum, body, masses, have, been, estimated, approximately, 8, 4, 8, 46, metric, tons, 9, 26, 9, 33, short, tons, a, specimen, nicknamed, scotty, rsm, p2523, 8, located, at, the, royal, saskatchewan, museum, is, reported, to, measure, 13, m, 43, ft, in, length, using, a, mass, estimation, technique, that, extrapolates, from, the, circumference, of, the, femur, scotty, was, estimated, as, the, largest, known, specimen, at, 8, 87, metric, tons, 9, 78, short, tons, in, body, mass, not, every, adult, tyrannosaurus, specimen, recovered, is, as, big, historically, average, adult, mass, estimates, have, varied, widely, over, the, years, from, as, low, as, 4, 5, metric, tons, 5, 0, short, tons, to, more, than, 7, 2, metric, tons, 7, 9, short, tons, with, most, modern, estimates, ranging, between, 5, 4, and, 8, 0, metric, tons, 6, 0, and, 8, 8, short, tons, a, 2024, study, estimated, based, on, allometry, that, world, record, sized, t, rex, specimens, 1, in, 100, 000, individuals, may, have, reached, lengths, and, weights, exceeding, 15, m, 49, ft, and, 15, 000, kg, 33, 000, lb, respectively, though, no, individuals, close, to, this, size, have, ever, been, found, the, study, also, found, that, there, was, little, evidence, of, size, based, sexual, dimorphism, in, t, rex, the, largest, known, t, rex, skulls, measure, up, to, 1, 54, meters, 5, ft, in, length, large, fenestrae, openings, in, the, skull, reduced, weight, as, in, all, carnivorous, theropods, in, other, respects, tyrannosaurus, s, skull, was, significantly, different, from, those, of, large, non, tyrannosaurid, theropods, it, was, extremely, wide, at, the, rear, but, had, a, narrow, snout, allowing, unusually, good, binocular, vision, the, skull, bones, were, massive, and, the, nasals, and, some, other, bones, were, fused, preventing, movement, between, them, but, many, were, pneumatized, contained, a, honeycomb, of, tiny, air, spaces, and, thus, lighter, these, and, other, skull, strengthening, features, are, part, of, the, tyrannosaurid, trend, towards, an, increasingly, powerful, bite, which, easily, surpassed, that, of, all, non, tyrannosaurids, the, tip, of, the, upper, jaw, was, u, shaped, most, non, tyrannosauroid, carnivores, had, v, shaped, upper, jaws, which, increased, the, amount, of, tissue, and, bone, a, tyrannosaur, could, rip, out, with, one, bite, although, it, also, increased, the, stresses, on, the, front, teeth, the, teeth, of, t, rex, displayed, marked, heterodonty, differences, in, shape, the, premaxillary, teeth, four, per, side, at, the, front, of, the, upper, jaw, were, closely, packed, d, shaped, in, cross, section, had, reinforcing, ridges, on, the, rear, surface, were, incisiform, their, tips, were, chisel, like, blades, and, curved, backwards, the, d, shaped, cross, section, reinforcing, ridges, and, backwards, curve, reduced, the, risk, that, the, teeth, would, snap, when, tyrannosaurus, bit, and, pulled, the, remaining, teeth, were, robust, like, lethal, bananas, rather, than, daggers, more, widely, spaced, and, also, had, reinforcing, ridges, those, in, the, upper, jaw, twelve, per, side, in, mature, individuals, were, larger, than, their, counterparts, of, the, lower, jaw, except, at, the, rear, the, largest, found, so, far, is, estimated, to, have, been, 30, 5, centimeters, 12, in, long, including, the, root, when, the, animal, was, alive, making, it, the, largest, tooth, of, any, carnivorous, dinosaur, yet, found, the, lower, jaw, was, robust, its, front, dentary, bone, bore, thirteen, teeth, behind, the, tooth, row, the, lower, jaw, became, notably, taller, the, upper, and, lower, jaws, of, tyrannosaurus, like, those, of, many, dinosaurs, possessed, numerous, foramina, or, small, holes, in, the, bone, various, functions, have, been, proposed, for, these, foramina, such, as, a, crocodile, like, sensory, system, or, evidence, of, extra, oral, structures, such, as, scales, or, potentially, lips, with, subsequent, research, on, theropod, tooth, wear, patterns, supporting, such, a, proposition, the, vertebral, column, of, tyrannosaurus, consisted, of, ten, neck, vertebrae, thirteen, back, vertebrae, and, five, sacral, vertebrae, the, number, of, tail, vertebrae, is, unknown, and, could, well, have, varied, between, individuals, but, probably, numbered, at, least, forty, sue, was, mounted, with, forty, seven, of, such, caudal, vertebrae, the, neck, of, t, rex, formed, a, natural, s, shaped, curve, like, that, of, other, theropods, compared, to, these, it, was, exceptionally, short, deep, and, muscular, to, support, the, massive, head, the, second, vertebra, the, axis, was, especially, short, the, remaining, neck, vertebrae, were, weakly, opisthocoelous, i, e, with, a, convex, front, of, the, vertebral, body, and, a, concave, rear, the, vertebral, bodies, had, single, pleurocoels, pneumatic, depressions, created, by, air, sacs, on, their, sides, the, vertebral, bodies, of, the, torso, were, robust, but, with, a, narrow, waist, their, undersides, were, keeled, the, front, sides, were, concave, with, a, deep, vertical, trough, they, had, large, pleurocoels, their, neural, spines, had, very, rough, front, and, rear, sides, for, the, attachment, of, strong, tendons, the, sacral, vertebrae, were, fused, to, each, other, both, in, their, vertebral, bodies, and, neural, spines, they, were, pneumatized, they, were, connected, to, the, pelvis, by, transverse, processes, and, sacral, ribs, the, tail, was, heavy, and, moderately, long, in, order, to, balance, the, massive, head, and, torso, and, to, provide, space, for, massive, locomotor, muscles, that, attached, to, the, thighbones, the, thirteenth, tail, vertebra, formed, the, transition, point, between, the, deep, tail, base, and, the, middle, tail, that, was, stiffened, by, a, rather, long, front, articulation, processes, the, underside, of, the, trunk, was, covered, by, eighteen, or, nineteen, pairs, of, segmented, belly, ribs, the, shoulder, girdle, was, longer, than, the, entire, forelimb, the, shoulder, blade, had, a, narrow, shaft, but, was, exceptionally, expanded, at, its, upper, end, it, connected, via, a, long, forward, protrusion, to, the, coracoid, which, was, rounded, both, shoulder, blades, were, connected, by, a, small, furcula, the, paired, breast, bones, possibly, were, made, of, cartilage, only, the, forelimb, or, arm, was, very, short, the, upper, arm, bone, the, humerus, was, short, but, robust, it, had, a, narrow, upper, end, with, an, exceptionally, rounded, head, the, lower, arm, bones, the, ulna, and, radius, were, straight, elements, much, shorter, than, the, humerus, the, second, metacarpal, was, longer, and, wider, than, the, first, whereas, normally, in, theropods, the, opposite, is, true, the, forelimbs, had, only, two, clawed, fingers, along, with, an, additional, splint, like, small, third, metacarpal, representing, the, remnant, of, a, third, digit, the, pelvis, was, a, large, structure, its, upper, bone, the, ilium, was, both, very, long, and, high, providing, an, extensive, attachment, area, for, hindlimb, muscles, the, front, pubic, bone, ended, in, an, enormous, pubic, boot, longer, than, the, entire, shaft, of, the, element, the, rear, ischium, was, slender, and, straight, pointing, obliquely, to, behind, and, below, in, contrast, to, the, arms, the, hindlimbs, were, among, the, longest, in, proportion, to, body, size, of, any, theropod, in, the, foot, the, metatarsus, was, arctometatarsalian, meaning, that, the, part, of, the, third, metatarsal, near, the, ankle, was, pinched, the, third, metatarsal, was, also, exceptionally, sinuous, compensating, for, the, immense, bulk, of, the, animal, many, bones, throughout, the, skeleton, were, hollowed, reducing, its, weight, without, significant, loss, of, strength, tyrannosaurus, is, the, type, genus, of, the, superfamily, tyrannosauroidea, the, family, tyrannosauridae, and, the, subfamily, tyrannosaurinae, in, other, words, it, is, the, standard, by, which, paleontologists, decide, whether, to, include, other, species, in, the, same, group, other, members, of, the, tyrannosaurine, subfamily, include, the, north, american, daspletosaurus, and, the, asian, tarbosaurus, both, of, which, have, occasionally, been, synonymized, with, tyrannosaurus, tyrannosaurids, were, once, commonly, thought, to, be, descendants, of, earlier, large, theropods, such, as, megalosaurs, and, carnosaurs, although, more, recently, they, were, reclassified, with, the, generally, smaller, coelurosaurs, the, earliest, tyrannosaur, group, were, the, crested, proceratosaurids, while, later, and, more, derived, members, belong, to, the, pantyrannosauria, tyrannosaurs, started, out, as, small, theropods, however, at, least, some, became, larger, by, the, early, cretaceous, tyrannosauroids, are, characterized, by, their, fused, nasals, and, dental, arrangement, pantyrannosaurs, are, characterized, by, unique, features, in, their, hips, as, well, as, an, enlarged, foramen, in, the, quadrate, a, broad, postorbital, and, hourglass, shaped, nasals, some, of, the, more, derived, pantyrannosaurs, lack, nasal, pneumaticity, and, have, a, lower, humerus, to, femur, ratio, with, their, arms, starting, to, see, some, reduction, some, pantyrannosaurs, started, developing, an, arctometatarsus, eutyrannosaurs, have, a, rough, texture, on, their, nasal, bones, and, their, mandibular, fenestra, is, reduced, externally, tyrannosaurids, lack, kinetic, skulls, or, special, crests, on, their, nasal, bones, and, have, a, lacrimal, with, a, distinctive, process, on, it, tyrannosaurids, also, have, an, interfenestral, strut, that, is, less, than, half, as, big, as, the, maxillary, fenestra, it, is, quite, likely, that, tyrannosauroids, rose, to, prominence, after, the, decline, in, allosauroid, and, megalosauroid, diversity, seen, during, the, early, stages, of, the, late, cretaceous, below, is, a, simple, cladogram, of, general, tyrannosauroid, relationships, that, was, found, after, an, analysis, conducted, by, li, and, colleagues, in, 2009, guanlong, proceratosaurus, dilong, eotyrannus, xiongguanlong, appalachiosaurus, tyrannosauridae, many, phylogenetic, analyses, have, found, tarbosaurus, bataar, to, be, the, sister, taxon, of, t, rex, the, discovery, of, the, tyrannosaurid, lythronax, further, indicates, that, tarbosaurus, and, tyrannosaurus, are, closely, related, forming, a, clade, with, fellow, asian, tyrannosaurid, zhuchengtyrannus, with, lythronax, being, their, sister, taxon, a, further, study, from, 2016, by, steve, brusatte, thomas, carr, and, colleagues, also, indicates, that, tyrannosaurus, may, have, been, an, immigrant, from, asia, as, well, as, a, possible, descendant, of, tarbosaurus, below, is, the, cladogram, of, tyrannosauridae, based, on, the, phylogenetic, analysis, conducted, by, loewen, and, colleagues, in, 2013, gorgosaurus, libratus, dinosaur, park, tyrannosaurid, daspletosaurus, torosus, two, medicine, tyrannosaurid, bistahieversor, sealeyi, lythronax, argestes, tyrannosaurus, rex, tarbosaurus, bataar, in, their, 2024, description, of, tyrannosaurus, mcraeensis, dalman, et, al, recovered, similar, results, to, previous, analyses, with, tyrannosaurus, as, the, sister, taxon, to, the, clade, formed, by, tarbosaurus, and, zhuchengtyrannus, called, the, tyrannosaurini, they, also, found, support, for, a, monophyletic, clade, containing, daspletosaurus, and, thanatotheristes, typically, referred, to, as, the, daspletosaurini, gorgosaurus, libratus, daspletosaurus, horneri, thanatotheristes, daspletosaurus, torosus, daspletosaurus, wilsoni, nanuqsaurus, bistahieversor, lythronax, tyrannosaurus, mcraeensis, tyrannosaurus, rex, tarbosaurus, in, 1955, soviet, paleontologist, evgeny, maleev, named, a, new, species, tyrannosaurus, bataar, from, mongolia, by, 1965, this, species, was, renamed, as, a, distinct, genus, tarbosaurus, bataar, while, most, palaeontologists, continue, to, maintain, the, two, as, distinct, genera, some, authors, such, as, thomas, holtz, kenneth, carpenter, and, thomas, carr, argue, that, the, two, species, are, similar, enough, to, be, considered, members, of, the, same, genus, restoring, the, mongolian, taxon, s, original, binomial, name, some, specimens, from, the, late, cretaceous, deposits, of, china, have, been, described, as, new, species, of, tyrannosaurus, t, lanpingensis, based, on, isolated, lateral, tooth, from, the, red, beds, of, yunnan, in, 1975, t, turpanensis, from, the, subashi, formation, turpan, basin, xinjiang, in, 1978, and, t, luanchuanensis, from, the, quiba, formation, tantou, basin, henan, province, in, 1979, 1980, all, these, taxa, were, published, without, detailed, descriptions, and, were, later, accepted, as, junior, synonyms, of, tarbosaurus, bataar, by, holtz, in, 2004, vgi, no, 231, 3, a, large, phalanx, bone, assigned, to, tyrannosaurus, sp, by, yarkov, in, 2000, was, found, in, the, lower, maastrichtian, of, bereslavka, russia, in, 2004, averianov, and, yarkov, reinterpreted, it, as, a, metacarpal, i, or, metatarsal, i, that, possibly, belongs, to, ceratosaur, in, their, 2023, overview, averianov, and, lopatin, mention, this, specimen, as, well, as, a, single, tooth, from, the, same, site, only, as, theropoda, indet, in, 2001, various, tyrannosaurid, teeth, and, a, metatarsal, unearthed, in, a, quarry, near, zhucheng, china, were, assigned, by, chinese, paleontologist, hu, chengzhi, to, the, newly, erected, species, tyrannosaurus, zhuchengensis, however, in, a, nearby, site, a, right, maxilla, and, left, jawbone, were, assigned, to, the, newly, erected, tyrannosaurid, genus, zhuchengtyrannus, in, 2011, it, is, possible, that, t, zhuchengensis, is, synonymous, with, zhuchengtyrannus, in, any, case, t, zhuchengensis, is, considered, to, be, a, nomen, dubium, as, the, holotype, lacks, diagnostic, features, below, the, level, tyrannosaurinae, in, a, 2022, study, gregory, s, paul, and, colleagues, argued, that, tyrannosaurus, rex, as, traditionally, understood, actually, represents, three, species, the, type, species, tyrannosaurus, rex, and, two, new, species, t, imperator, meaning, tyrant, lizard, emperor, and, t, regina, meaning, tyrant, lizard, queen, the, holotype, of, the, former, t, imperator, is, the, sue, specimen, and, the, holotype, of, the, latter, t, regina, is, wankel, rex, the, division, into, multiple, species, was, primarily, based, on, the, observation, of, a, very, high, degree, of, variation, in, the, proportions, and, robusticity, of, the, femur, and, other, skeletal, elements, across, catalogued, t, rex, specimens, more, so, than, that, observed, in, other, theropods, recognized, as, one, species, differences, of, general, body, proportions, representing, robust, and, gracile, morphotypes, were, also, used, as, a, line, of, evidence, in, addition, to, the, number, of, small, slender, incisiform, teeth, in, the, dentary, as, based, on, tooth, sockets, specifically, the, paper, s, t, rex, was, distinguished, by, robust, anatomy, a, moderate, ratio, of, femur, length, vs, circumference, and, the, possession, of, a, singular, slender, incisiform, dentary, tooth, t, imperator, was, considered, to, be, robust, with, a, small, femur, length, to, circumference, ratio, and, two, of, the, slender, teeth, and, t, regina, was, a, gracile, form, with, a, high, femur, ratio, and, one, of, the, slender, teeth, it, was, observed, that, variation, in, proportions, and, robustness, became, more, extreme, higher, up, in, the, sample, stratigraphically, this, was, interpreted, as, a, single, earlier, population, t, imperator, speciating, into, more, than, one, taxon, t, rex, and, t, regina, however, several, other, leading, paleontologists, including, stephen, brusatte, thomas, carr, thomas, holtz, david, hone, jingmai, o, connor, and, lindsay, zanno, criticized, the, study, or, expressed, skepticism, of, its, conclusions, when, approached, by, various, media, outlets, for, comment, their, criticism, was, subsequently, published, in, a, technical, paper, holtz, and, zanno, both, remarked, that, it, was, plausible, that, more, than, one, species, of, tyrannosaurus, existed, but, felt, the, new, study, was, insufficient, to, support, the, species, it, proposed, holtz, remarked, that, even, if, tyrannosaurus, imperator, represented, a, distinct, species, from, tyrannosaurus, rex, it, may, represent, the, same, species, as, nanotyrannus, lancensis, and, would, need, to, be, called, tyrannosaurus, lancensis, o, connor, a, curator, at, the, field, museum, where, the, t, imperator, holotype, sue, is, displayed, regarded, the, new, species, as, too, poorly, supported, to, justify, modifying, the, exhibit, signs, brusatte, carr, and, o, connor, viewed, the, distinguishing, features, proposed, between, the, species, as, reflecting, natural, variation, within, a, species, both, carr, and, o, connor, expressed, concerns, about, the, study, s, inability, to, determine, which, of, the, proposed, species, several, well, preserved, specimens, belonged, to, another, paleontologist, philip, j, currie, originally, co, authored, the, study, but, withdrew, from, it, as, he, did, not, want, to, be, involved, in, naming, the, new, species, paul, still, rejected, the, objections, raised, by, critics, insisting, that, they, are, unwilling, to, consider, that, tyrannosaurus, might, represent, more, than, one, species, in, 2024, dalman, and, colleagues, described, the, remains, of, a, tyrannosaur, discovered, in, 1983, in, the, campanian, early, maastrichtian, hall, lake, formation, in, new, mexico, reposited, at, the, new, mexico, museum, of, natural, history, and, science, the, fossil, material, nmmnh, p, 3698, consists, of, the, right, postorbital, right, squamosal, left, palatine, and, an, incomplete, maxilla, from, the, skull, the, left, dentary, right, splenial, right, prearticular, right, angular, and, right, articular, from, the, lower, jaws, isolated, teeth, and, chevrons, some, of, the, bones, were, briefly, mentioned, in, 1984, as, belonging, to, t, rex, and, described, in, 1986, lehman, and, carpenter, 1990, suggested, that, nmmnh, p, 3698, belonged, to, a, new, tyrannosaurid, genus, while, carr, and, williamson, 2000, disagreed, with, their, claim, sullivan, and, lucas, 2015, argued, that, there, is, little, evidence, to, support, nmmnh, p, 3698, as, a, specimen, of, tyrannosaurus, rex, so, they, tentatively, classified, it, as, cf, tyrannosaurus, sp, they, also, considered, that, the, mcrae, tyrannosaur, lived, before, lancian, before, 67, million, years, ago, based, on, its, coexistence, with, alamosaurus, dalman, et, al, 2024, proposed, the, new, name, tyrannosaurus, mcraeensis, for, the, holotype, nmmnh, p, 3698, referencing, the, mcrae, group, the, rock, layers, to, which, the, hall, lake, formation, belongs, these, rock, layers, were, estimated, to, date, to, between, 72, 7, and, 70, 9, ma, correlating, to, the, latest, campanian, or, earliest, maastrichtian, u, pb, zircon, age, estimates, by, schantz, and, amato, 2024, also, support, the, late, campanian, to, early, maastrichtian, age, of, the, hall, lake, formation, this, is, approximately, 5, 7, million, years, before, t, rex, which, existed, at, the, end, of, the, maastrichtian, t, mcraeensis, was, estimated, at, 12, metres, 39, ft, long, which, is, similar, to, the, size, of, an, adult, t, rex, the, two, are, distinguished, by, characters, of, the, skull, amongst, these, the, dentary, of, t, mcraeensis, is, proportionately, longer, and, possesses, a, less, prominent, chin, and, the, lower, jaw, shallower, than, that, of, t, rex, suggesting, a, weaker, bite, the, teeth, are, likewise, blunter, and, more, laterally, compressed, while, the, post, orbital, crests, are, less, prominent, likewise, the, skeletal, anatomy, showcases, shared, characteristics, with, tarbosaurus, and, zhuchengtyrannus, other, tyrannosaurid, fossils, found, in, the, same, formations, as, t, rex, were, originally, classified, as, separate, taxa, including, aublysodon, and, albertosaurus, megagracilis, the, latter, being, named, dinotyrannus, megagracilis, in, 1995, these, fossils, are, now, universally, considered, to, belong, to, juvenile, t, rex, a, small, but, nearly, complete, skull, from, montana, 60, centimeters, 2, 0, ft, long, might, be, an, exception, this, skull, cmnh, 7541, was, originally, classified, as, a, species, of, gorgosaurus, g, lancensis, by, charles, w, gilmore, in, 1946, in, 1988, the, specimen, was, re, described, by, robert, t, bakker, phil, currie, and, michael, williams, then, the, curator, of, paleontology, at, the, cleveland, museum, of, natural, history, where, the, original, specimen, was, housed, and, is, now, on, display, their, initial, research, indicated, that, the, skull, bones, were, fused, and, that, it, therefore, represented, an, adult, specimen, in, light, of, this, bakker, and, colleagues, assigned, the, skull, to, a, new, genus, named, nanotyrannus, meaning, dwarf, tyrant, for, its, apparently, small, adult, size, the, specimen, is, estimated, to, have, been, around, 5, 2, meters, 17, ft, long, when, it, died, however, in, 1999, a, detailed, analysis, by, thomas, carr, revealed, the, specimen, to, be, a, juvenile, leading, carr, and, many, other, paleontologists, to, consider, it, a, juvenile, t, rex, individual, in, 2001, a, more, complete, juvenile, tyrannosaur, nicknamed, jane, catalog, number, bmrp, 2002, 4, 1, belonging, to, the, same, species, as, the, original, nanotyrannus, specimen, was, uncovered, this, discovery, prompted, a, conference, on, tyrannosaurs, focused, on, the, issues, of, nanotyrannus, validity, at, the, burpee, museum, of, natural, history, in, 2005, several, paleontologists, who, had, previously, published, opinions, that, n, lancensis, was, a, valid, species, including, currie, and, williams, saw, the, discovery, of, jane, as, a, confirmation, that, nanotyrannus, was, in, fact, a, juvenile, t, rex, peter, larson, continued, to, support, the, hypothesis, that, n, lancensis, was, a, separate, but, closely, related, species, based, on, skull, features, such, as, two, more, teeth, in, both, jaws, than, t, rex, as, well, as, proportionately, larger, hands, with, phalanges, on, the, third, metacarpal, and, different, wishbone, anatomy, in, an, undescribed, specimen, he, also, argued, that, stygivenator, generally, considered, to, be, a, juvenile, t, rex, may, be, a, younger, nanotyrannus, specimen, later, research, revealed, that, other, tyrannosaurids, such, as, gorgosaurus, also, experienced, reduction, in, tooth, count, during, growth, and, given, the, disparity, in, tooth, count, between, individuals, of, the, same, age, group, in, this, genus, and, tyrannosaurus, this, feature, may, also, be, due, to, individual, variation, in, 2013, carr, noted, that, all, of, the, differences, claimed, to, support, nanotyrannus, have, turned, out, to, be, individually, or, ontogenetically, variable, features, or, products, of, distortion, of, the, bones, in, 2016, analysis, of, limb, proportions, by, persons, and, currie, suggested, nanotyrannus, specimens, to, have, differing, cursoriality, levels, potentially, separating, it, from, t, rex, however, paleontologist, manabu, sakomoto, has, commented, that, this, conclusion, may, be, impacted, by, low, sample, size, and, the, discrepancy, does, not, necessarily, reflect, taxonomic, distinction, in, 2016, joshua, schmerge, argued, for, nanotyrannus, validity, based, on, skull, features, including, a, dentary, groove, in, bmrp, 2002, 4, 1, s, skull, according, to, schmerge, as, that, feature, is, absent, in, t, rex, and, found, only, in, dryptosaurus, and, albertosaurines, this, suggests, nanotyrannus, is, a, distinct, taxon, within, the, albertosaurinae, the, same, year, carr, and, colleagues, noted, that, this, was, not, sufficient, enough, to, clarify, nanotyrannus, validity, or, classification, being, a, common, and, ontogenetically, variable, feature, among, tyrannosauroids, a, 2020, study, by, holly, woodward, and, colleagues, showed, the, specimens, referred, to, nanotyrannus, were, all, ontogenetically, immature, and, found, it, probable, that, these, specimens, belonged, to, t, rex, the, same, year, carr, published, a, paper, on, t, rex, s, growth, history, finding, that, cmnh, 7541, fit, within, the, expected, ontogenetic, variation, of, the, taxon, and, displayed, juvenile, characteristics, found, in, other, specimens, it, was, classified, as, a, juvenile, under, 13, years, old, with, a, skull, less, than, 80, cm, 31, in, no, significant, sexual, or, phylogenetic, variation, was, discernible, among, any, of, the, 44, specimens, studied, with, carr, stating, that, characters, of, potential, phylogenetic, importance, decrease, throughout, age, at, the, same, rate, as, growth, occurs, discussing, the, paper, s, results, carr, described, how, all, nanotyrannus, specimens, formed, a, continual, growth, transition, between, the, smallest, juveniles, and, the, subadults, unlike, what, would, be, expected, if, it, were, a, distinct, taxon, where, the, specimens, would, group, to, the, exclusion, of, tyrannosaurus, carr, concluded, that, the, nanomorphs, are, not, all, that, similar, to, each, other, and, instead, form, an, important, bridge, in, the, growth, series, of, t, rex, that, captures, the, beginnings, of, the, profound, change, from, the, shallow, skull, of, juveniles, to, the, deep, skull, that, is, seen, in, fully, developed, adults, however, a, 2024, paper, published, by, nick, longrich, and, evan, thomas, saitta, reexamined, the, holotype, and, referred, specimens, of, nanotyrannus, based, on, several, factors, including, differences, in, morphology, ontogeny, and, phylogeny, longrich, and, saitta, suggest, that, nanotyrannus, is, a, distinct, taxon, which, may, fall, outside, of, tyrannosauridae, based, on, some, of, their, phylogenetic, analyses, the, identification, of, several, specimens, as, juvenile, t, rex, has, allowed, scientists, to, document, ontogenetic, changes, in, the, species, estimate, the, lifespan, and, determine, how, quickly, the, animals, would, have, grown, the, smallest, known, individual, lacm, 28471, the, jordan, theropod, is, estimated, to, have, weighed, only, 30, kg, 66, lb, while, the, largest, adults, such, as, fmnh, pr2081, sue, most, likely, weighed, about, 5, 650, kg, 12, 460, lb, histologic, analysis, of, t, rex, bones, showed, lacm, 28471, had, aged, only, 2, years, when, it, died, while, sue, was, 28, years, old, an, age, which, may, have, been, close, to, the, maximum, for, the, species, histology, has, also, allowed, the, age, of, other, specimens, to, be, determined, growth, curves, can, be, developed, when, the, ages, of, different, specimens, are, plotted, on, a, graph, along, with, their, mass, a, t, rex, growth, curve, is, s, shaped, with, juveniles, remaining, under, 1, 800, kg, 4, 000, lb, until, approximately, 14, years, of, age, when, body, size, began, to, increase, dramatically, during, this, rapid, growth, phase, a, young, t, rex, would, gain, an, average, of, 600, kg, 1, 300, lb, a, year, for, the, next, four, years, at, 18, years, of, age, the, curve, plateaus, again, indicating, that, growth, slowed, dramatically, for, example, only, 600, kg, 1, 300, lb, separated, the, 28, year, old, sue, from, a, 22, year, old, canadian, specimen, rtmp, 81, 12, 1, a, 2004, histological, study, performed, by, different, workers, corroborates, these, results, finding, that, rapid, growth, began, to, slow, at, around, 16, years, of, age, a, study, by, hutchinson, and, colleagues, in, 2011, corroborated, the, previous, estimation, methods, in, general, but, their, estimation, of, peak, growth, rates, is, significantly, higher, it, found, that, the, maximum, growth, rates, for, t, rex, during, the, exponential, stage, are, 1790, kg, year, although, these, results, were, much, higher, than, previous, estimations, the, authors, noted, that, these, results, significantly, lowered, the, great, difference, between, its, actual, growth, rate, and, the, one, which, would, be, expected, of, an, animal, of, its, size, the, sudden, change, in, growth, rate, at, the, end, of, the, growth, spurt, may, indicate, physical, maturity, a, hypothesis, which, is, supported, by, the, discovery, of, medullary, tissue, in, the, femur, of, a, 16, to, 20, year, old, t, rex, from, montana, mor, 1125, also, known, as, b, rex, medullary, tissue, is, found, only, in, female, birds, during, ovulation, indicating, that, b, rex, was, of, reproductive, age, further, study, indicates, an, age, of, 18, for, this, specimen, in, 2016, it, was, finally, confirmed, by, mary, higby, schweitzer, and, lindsay, zanno, and, colleagues, that, the, soft, tissue, within, the, femur, of, mor, 1125, was, medullary, tissue, this, also, confirmed, the, identity, of, the, specimen, as, a, female, the, discovery, of, medullary, bone, tissue, within, tyrannosaurus, may, prove, valuable, in, determining, the, sex, of, other, dinosaur, species, in, future, examinations, as, the, chemical, makeup, of, medullary, tissue, is, unmistakable, other, tyrannosaurids, exhibit, extremely, similar, growth, curves, although, with, lower, growth, rates, corresponding, to, their, lower, adult, sizes, an, additional, study, published, in, 2020, by, woodward, and, colleagues, for, the, journal, science, advances, indicates, that, during, their, growth, from, juvenile, to, adult, tyrannosaurus, was, capable, of, slowing, down, its, growth, to, counter, environmental, factors, such, as, lack, of, food, the, study, focusing, on, two, juvenile, specimens, between, 13, and, 15, years, old, housed, at, the, burpee, museum, in, illinois, indicates, that, the, rate, of, maturation, for, tyrannosaurus, was, dependent, on, resource, abundance, this, study, also, indicates, that, in, such, changing, environments, tyrannosaurus, was, particularly, well, suited, to, an, environment, that, shifted, yearly, in, regards, to, resource, abundance, hinting, that, other, midsize, predators, might, have, had, difficulty, surviving, in, such, harsh, conditions, and, explaining, the, niche, partitioning, between, juvenile, and, adult, tyrannosaurs, the, study, further, indicates, that, tyrannosaurus, and, the, dubious, genus, nanotyrannus, are, synonymous, due, to, analysis, of, the, growth, rings, in, the, bones, of, the, two, specimens, studied, over, half, of, the, known, t, rex, specimens, appear, to, have, died, within, six, years, of, reaching, sexual, maturity, a, pattern, which, is, also, seen, in, other, tyrannosaurs, and, in, some, large, long, lived, birds, and, mammals, today, these, species, are, characterized, by, high, infant, mortality, rates, followed, by, relatively, low, mortality, among, juveniles, mortality, increases, again, following, sexual, maturity, partly, due, to, the, stresses, of, reproduction, one, study, suggests, that, the, rarity, of, juvenile, t, rex, fossils, is, due, in, part, to, low, juvenile, mortality, rates, the, animals, were, not, dying, in, large, numbers, at, these, ages, and, thus, were, not, often, fossilized, this, rarity, may, also, be, due, to, the, incompleteness, of, the, fossil, record, or, to, the, bias, of, fossil, collectors, towards, larger, more, spectacular, specimens, in, a, 2013, lecture, thomas, holtz, jr, suggested, that, dinosaurs, lived, fast, and, died, young, because, they, reproduced, quickly, whereas, mammals, have, long, lifespans, because, they, take, longer, to, reproduce, gregory, s, paul, also, writes, that, tyrannosaurus, reproduced, quickly, and, died, young, but, attributes, their, short, lifespans, to, the, dangerous, lives, they, lived, the, discovery, of, feathered, dinosaurs, led, to, debate, regarding, whether, and, to, what, extent, tyrannosaurus, might, have, been, feathered, filamentous, structures, which, are, commonly, recognized, as, the, precursors, of, feathers, have, been, reported, in, the, small, bodied, basal, tyrannosauroid, dilong, paradoxus, from, the, early, cretaceous, yixian, formation, of, china, in, 2004, because, integumentary, impressions, of, larger, tyrannosauroids, known, at, that, time, showed, evidence, of, scales, the, researchers, who, studied, dilong, speculated, that, insulating, feathers, might, have, been, lost, by, larger, species, due, to, their, smaller, surface, to, volume, ratio, the, subsequent, discovery, of, the, giant, species, yutyrannus, huali, also, from, the, yixian, showed, that, even, some, large, tyrannosauroids, had, feathers, covering, much, of, their, bodies, casting, doubt, on, the, hypothesis, that, they, were, a, size, related, feature, a, 2017, study, reviewed, known, skin, impressions, of, tyrannosaurids, including, those, of, a, tyrannosaurus, specimen, nicknamed, wyrex, hmns, 2006, 1743, 01, formerly, known, as, bhi, 6230, which, preserves, patches, of, mosaic, scales, on, the, tail, hip, and, neck, the, study, concluded, that, feather, covering, of, large, tyrannosaurids, such, as, tyrannosaurus, was, if, present, limited, to, the, upper, side, of, the, trunk, a, conference, abstract, published, in, 2016, posited, that, theropods, such, as, tyrannosaurus, had, their, upper, teeth, covered, in, lips, instead, of, bare, teeth, as, seen, in, crocodilians, this, was, based, on, the, presence, of, enamel, which, according, to, the, study, needs, to, remain, hydrated, an, issue, not, faced, by, aquatic, animals, like, crocodilians, however, there, has, been, criticism, where, it, favors, the, idea, for, lips, with, the, 2017, analytical, study, proposing, that, tyrannosaurids, had, large, flat, scales, on, their, snouts, instead, of, lips, as, modern, crocodiles, do, but, crocodiles, possess, rather, cracked, keratinized, skin, not, flat, scales, by, observing, the, hummocky, rugosity, of, tyrannosaurids, and, comparing, it, to, extant, lizards, researchers, have, found, that, tyrannosaurids, had, squamose, scales, rather, than, a, crocodillian, like, skin, in, 2023, cullen, and, colleagues, supported, the, idea, that, theropods, like, tyrannosaurids, had, lips, based, on, anatomical, patterns, such, as, those, of, the, foramina, on, their, face, and, jaws, more, similar, to, those, of, modern, squamates, such, as, monitor, lizards, or, marine, iguanas, than, those, of, modern, crocodilians, like, alligators, by, comparatively, analysing, the, dentition, of, daspletosaurus, and, the, american, alligator, it, was, shown, that, the, enamel, of, tyrannosaurids, had, no, significant, wear, while, that, of, modern, crocodilians, had, erosion, on, the, labial, side, and, substantial, wear, this, suggests, that, it, is, likely, that, theropod, teeth, existed, under, hydrated, conditions, i, e, extraoral, tissues, on, the, basis, of, the, relationship, between, hydration, and, wear, resistance, the, authors, argued, that, it, is, unlikely, that, the, teeth, of, theropods, including, tyrannosaurids, would, have, remained, unworn, when, exposed, for, a, long, time, as, it, would, have, been, difficult, to, maintain, hydration, the, authors, also, performed, regression, analyses, to, demonstrate, the, relationship, between, tooth, height, and, skull, length, and, found, that, varanids, like, the, crocodile, monitor, had, substantially, greater, tooth, height, to, skull, length, ratios, than, tyrannosaurus, indicating, that, the, teeth, of, theropods, were, not, too, big, to, be, covered, by, extraoral, tissues, when, the, mouth, was, closed, as, the, number, of, known, specimens, increased, scientists, began, to, analyze, the, variation, between, individuals, and, discovered, what, appeared, to, be, two, distinct, body, types, or, morphs, similar, to, some, other, theropod, species, as, one, of, these, morphs, was, more, solidly, built, it, was, termed, the, robust, morph, while, the, other, was, termed, gracile, several, morphological, differences, associated, with, the, two, morphs, were, used, to, analyze, sexual, dimorphism, in, t, rex, with, the, robust, morph, usually, suggested, to, be, female, for, example, the, pelvis, of, several, robust, specimens, seemed, to, be, wider, perhaps, to, allow, the, passage, of, eggs, it, was, also, thought, that, the, robust, morphology, correlated, with, a, reduced, chevron, on, the, first, tail, vertebra, also, ostensibly, to, allow, eggs, to, pass, out, of, the, reproductive, tract, as, had, been, erroneously, reported, for, crocodiles, in, recent, years, evidence, for, sexual, dimorphism, has, been, weakened, a, 2005, study, reported, that, previous, claims, of, sexual, dimorphism, in, crocodile, chevron, anatomy, were, in, error, casting, doubt, on, the, existence, of, similar, dimorphism, between, t, rex, sexes, a, full, sized, chevron, was, discovered, on, the, first, tail, vertebra, of, sue, an, extremely, robust, individual, indicating, that, this, feature, could, not, be, used, to, differentiate, the, two, morphs, anyway, as, t, rex, specimens, have, been, found, from, saskatchewan, to, new, mexico, differences, between, individuals, may, be, indicative, of, geographic, variation, rather, than, sexual, dimorphism, the, differences, could, also, be, age, related, with, robust, individuals, being, older, animals, only, a, single, tyrannosaurus, specimen, has, been, conclusively, shown, to, belong, to, a, specific, sex, examination, of, b, rex, demonstrated, the, preservation, of, soft, tissue, within, several, bones, some, of, this, tissue, has, been, identified, as, a, medullary, tissue, a, specialized, tissue, grown, only, in, modern, birds, as, a, source, of, calcium, for, the, production, of, eggshell, during, ovulation, as, only, female, birds, lay, eggs, medullary, tissue, is, only, found, naturally, in, females, although, males, are, capable, of, producing, it, when, injected, with, female, reproductive, hormones, like, estrogen, this, strongly, suggests, that, b, rex, was, female, and, that, she, died, during, ovulation, recent, research, has, shown, that, medullary, tissue, is, never, found, in, crocodiles, which, are, thought, to, be, the, closest, living, relatives, of, dinosaurs, the, shared, presence, of, medullary, tissue, in, birds, and, other, theropod, dinosaurs, is, further, evidence, of, the, close, evolutionary, relationship, between, the, two, like, many, bipedal, dinosaurs, t, rex, was, historically, depicted, as, a, living, tripod, with, the, body, at, 45, degrees, or, less, from, the, vertical, and, the, tail, dragging, along, the, ground, similar, to, a, kangaroo, this, concept, dates, from, joseph, leidy, s, 1865, reconstruction, of, hadrosaurus, the, first, to, depict, a, dinosaur, in, a, bipedal, posture, in, 1915, convinced, that, the, creature, stood, upright, henry, fairfield, osborn, former, president, of, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, further, reinforced, the, notion, in, unveiling, the, first, complete, t, rex, skeleton, arranged, this, way, it, stood, in, an, upright, pose, for, 77, years, until, it, was, dismantled, in, 1992, by, 1970, scientists, realized, this, pose, was, incorrect, and, could, not, have, been, maintained, by, a, living, animal, as, it, would, have, resulted, in, the, dislocation, or, weakening, of, several, joints, including, the, hips, and, the, articulation, between, the, head, and, the, spinal, column, the, inaccurate, amnh, mount, inspired, similar, depictions, in, many, films, and, paintings, such, as, rudolph, zallinger, s, famous, mural, the, age, of, reptiles, in, yale, university, s, peabody, museum, of, natural, history, until, the, 1990s, when, films, such, as, jurassic, park, introduced, a, more, accurate, posture, to, the, general, public, modern, representations, in, museums, art, and, film, show, t, rex, with, its, body, approximately, parallel, to, the, ground, with, the, tail, extended, behind, the, body, to, balance, the, head, to, sit, down, tyrannosaurus, may, have, settled, its, weight, backwards, and, rested, its, weight, on, a, pubic, boot, the, wide, expansion, at, the, end, of, the, pubis, in, some, dinosaurs, with, its, weight, rested, on, the, pelvis, it, may, have, been, free, to, move, the, hindlimbs, getting, back, up, again, might, have, involved, some, stabilization, from, the, diminutive, forelimbs, the, latter, known, as, newman, s, pushup, theory, has, been, debated, nonetheless, tyrannosaurus, was, probably, able, to, get, up, if, it, fell, which, only, would, have, required, placing, the, limbs, below, the, center, of, gravity, with, the, tail, as, an, effective, counterbalance, healed, stress, fractures, in, the, forelimbs, have, been, put, forward, both, as, evidence, that, the, arms, cannot, have, been, very, useful, and, as, evidence, that, they, were, indeed, used, and, acquired, wounds, like, the, rest, of, the, body, when, t, rex, was, first, discovered, the, humerus, was, the, only, element, of, the, forelimb, known, for, the, initial, mounted, skeleton, as, seen, by, the, public, in, 1915, osborn, substituted, longer, three, fingered, forelimbs, like, those, of, allosaurus, a, year, earlier, lawrence, lambe, described, the, short, two, fingered, forelimbs, of, the, closely, related, gorgosaurus, this, strongly, suggested, that, t, rex, had, similar, forelimbs, but, this, hypothesis, was, not, confirmed, until, the, first, complete, t, rex, forelimbs, were, identified, in, 1989, belonging, to, mor, 555, the, wankel, rex, the, remains, of, sue, also, include, complete, forelimbs, t, rex, arms, are, very, small, relative, to, overall, body, size, measuring, only, 1, meter, 3, 3, ft, long, and, some, scholars, have, labelled, them, as, vestigial, however, the, bones, show, large, areas, for, muscle, attachment, indicating, considerable, strength, this, was, recognized, as, early, as, 1906, by, osborn, who, speculated, that, the, forelimbs, may, have, been, used, to, grasp, a, mate, during, copulation, newman, 1970, suggested, that, the, forelimbs, were, used, to, assist, tyrannosaurus, in, rising, from, a, prone, position, since, then, other, functions, have, been, proposed, although, some, scholars, find, them, implausible, padian, 2022, argued, that, the, reduction, of, the, arms, in, tyrannosaurids, did, not, serve, a, particular, function, but, was, a, secondary, adaptation, stating, that, as, tyrannosaurids, developed, larger, and, more, powerful, skulls, and, jaws, the, arms, got, smaller, to, avoid, being, bitten, or, torn, by, other, individuals, particularly, during, group, feedings, another, possibility, is, that, the, forelimbs, held, struggling, prey, while, it, was, killed, by, the, tyrannosaur, s, enormous, jaws, this, hypothesis, may, be, supported, by, biomechanical, analysis, t, rex, forelimb, bones, exhibit, extremely, thick, cortical, bone, which, has, been, interpreted, as, evidence, that, they, were, developed, to, withstand, heavy, loads, the, biceps, brachii, muscle, of, an, adult, t, rex, was, capable, of, lifting, 199, kilograms, 439, lb, by, itself, other, muscles, such, as, the, brachialis, would, work, along, with, the, biceps, to, make, elbow, flexion, even, more, powerful, the, m, biceps, muscle, of, t, rex, was, 3, 5, times, as, powerful, as, the, human, equivalent, a, t, rex, forearm, had, a, limited, range, of, motion, with, the, shoulder, and, elbow, joints, allowing, only, 40, and, 45, degrees, of, motion, respectively, in, contrast, the, same, two, joints, in, deinonychus, allow, up, to, 88, and, 130, degrees, of, motion, respectively, while, a, human, arm, can, rotate, 360, degrees, at, the, shoulder, and, move, through, 165, degrees, at, the, elbow, the, heavy, build, of, the, arm, bones, strength, of, the, muscles, and, limited, range, of, motion, may, indicate, a, system, evolved, to, hold, fast, despite, the, stresses, of, a, struggling, prey, animal, in, the, first, detailed, scientific, description, of, tyrannosaurus, forelimbs, paleontologists, kenneth, carpenter, and, matt, smith, dismissed, notions, that, the, forelimbs, were, useless, or, that, tyrannosaurus, was, an, obligate, scavenger, the, idea, that, the, arms, served, as, weapons, when, hunting, prey, have, also, been, proposed, by, steven, m, stanley, who, suggested, that, the, arms, were, used, for, slashing, prey, especially, by, using, the, claws, to, rapidly, inflict, long, deep, gashes, to, its, prey, this, was, dismissed, by, padian, who, argued, that, stanley, based, his, conclusion, on, incorrectly, estimated, forelimb, size, and, range, of, motion, tyrannosaurus, like, most, dinosaurs, was, long, thought, to, have, an, ectothermic, cold, blooded, reptilian, metabolism, the, idea, of, dinosaur, ectothermy, was, challenged, by, scientists, like, robert, t, bakker, and, john, ostrom, in, the, early, years, of, the, dinosaur, renaissance, beginning, in, the, late, 1960s, t, rex, itself, was, claimed, to, have, been, endothermic, warm, blooded, implying, a, very, active, lifestyle, since, then, several, paleontologists, have, sought, to, determine, the, ability, of, tyrannosaurus, to, regulate, its, body, temperature, histological, evidence, of, high, growth, rates, in, young, t, rex, comparable, to, those, of, mammals, and, birds, may, support, the, hypothesis, of, a, high, metabolism, growth, curves, indicate, that, as, in, mammals, and, birds, t, rex, growth, was, limited, mostly, to, immature, animals, rather, than, the, indeterminate, growth, seen, in, most, other, vertebrates, oxygen, isotope, ratios, in, fossilized, bone, are, sometimes, used, to, determine, the, temperature, at, which, the, bone, was, deposited, as, the, ratio, between, certain, isotopes, correlates, with, temperature, in, one, specimen, the, isotope, ratios, in, bones, from, different, parts, of, the, body, indicated, a, temperature, difference, of, no, more, than, 4, to, 5, c, 7, to, 9, f, between, the, vertebrae, of, the, torso, and, the, tibia, of, the, lower, leg, this, small, temperature, range, between, the, body, core, and, the, extremities, was, claimed, by, paleontologist, reese, barrick, and, geochemist, william, showers, to, indicate, that, t, rex, maintained, a, constant, internal, body, temperature, homeothermy, and, that, it, enjoyed, a, metabolism, somewhere, between, ectothermic, reptiles, and, endothermic, mammals, other, scientists, have, pointed, out, that, the, ratio, of, oxygen, isotopes, in, the, fossils, today, does, not, necessarily, represent, the, same, ratio, in, the, distant, past, and, may, have, been, altered, during, or, after, fossilization, diagenesis, barrick, and, showers, have, defended, their, conclusions, in, subsequent, papers, finding, similar, results, in, another, theropod, dinosaur, from, a, different, continent, and, tens, of, millions, of, years, earlier, in, time, giganotosaurus, ornithischian, dinosaurs, also, showed, evidence, of, homeothermy, while, varanid, lizards, from, the, same, formation, did, not, in, 2022, wiemann, and, colleagues, used, a, different, approach, the, spectroscopy, of, lipoxidation, signals, which, are, byproducts, of, oxidative, phosphorylation, and, correlate, with, metabolic, rates, to, show, that, various, dinosaur, genera, including, tyrannosaurus, had, endothermic, metabolisms, on, par, with, that, of, modern, birds, and, higher, than, that, of, mammals, they, also, suggested, that, such, a, metabolism, was, ancestrally, common, to, all, dinosaurs, even, if, t, rex, does, exhibit, evidence, of, homeothermy, it, does, not, necessarily, mean, that, it, was, endothermic, such, thermoregulation, may, also, be, explained, by, gigantothermy, as, in, some, living, sea, turtles, similar, to, contemporary, crocodilians, openings, dorsotemporal, fenestrae, in, the, skull, roofs, of, tyrannosaurus, may, have, aided, thermoregulation, in, the, march, 2005, issue, of, science, mary, higby, schweitzer, of, north, carolina, state, university, and, colleagues, announced, the, recovery, of, soft, tissue, from, the, marrow, cavity, of, a, fossilized, leg, bone, from, a, t, rex, the, bone, had, been, intentionally, though, reluctantly, broken, for, shipping, and, then, not, preserved, in, the, normal, manner, specifically, because, schweitzer, was, hoping, to, test, it, for, soft, tissue, designated, as, the, museum, of, the, rockies, specimen, 1125, or, mor, 1125, the, dinosaur, was, previously, excavated, from, the, hell, creek, formation, flexible, bifurcating, blood, vessels, and, fibrous, but, elastic, bone, matrix, tissue, were, recognized, in, addition, microstructures, resembling, blood, cells, were, found, inside, the, matrix, and, vessels, the, structures, bear, resemblance, to, ostrich, blood, cells, and, vessels, whether, an, unknown, process, distinct, from, normal, fossilization, preserved, the, material, or, the, material, is, original, the, researchers, do, not, know, and, they, are, careful, not, to, make, any, claims, about, preservation, if, it, is, found, to, be, original, material, any, surviving, proteins, may, be, used, as, a, means, of, indirectly, guessing, some, of, the, dna, content, of, the, dinosaurs, involved, because, each, protein, is, typically, created, by, a, specific, gene, the, absence, of, previous, finds, may, be, the, result, of, people, assuming, preserved, tissue, was, impossible, therefore, not, looking, since, the, first, two, more, tyrannosaurs, and, a, hadrosaur, have, also, been, found, to, have, such, tissue, like, structures, research, on, some, of, the, tissues, involved, has, suggested, that, birds, are, closer, relatives, to, tyrannosaurs, than, other, modern, animals, the, original, endogenous, chemistry, was, also, found, in, mor, 1125, based, on, preservation, of, elements, associated, with, bone, remodeling, and, redeposition, sulfur, calcium, zinc, which, showed, that, the, bone, cortices, are, similar, to, those, of, extant, birds, in, studies, reported, in, science, in, april, 2007, asara, and, colleagues, concluded, that, seven, traces, of, collagen, proteins, detected, in, purified, t, rex, bone, most, closely, match, those, reported, in, chickens, followed, by, frogs, and, newts, the, discovery, of, proteins, from, a, creature, tens, of, millions, of, years, old, along, with, similar, traces, the, team, found, in, a, mastodon, bone, at, least, 160, 000, years, old, upends, the, conventional, view, of, fossils, and, may, shift, paleontologists, focus, from, bone, hunting, to, biochemistry, until, these, finds, most, scientists, presumed, that, fossilization, replaced, all, living, tissue, with, inert, minerals, paleontologist, hans, larsson, of, mcgill, university, in, montreal, who, was, not, part, of, the, studies, called, the, finds, a, milestone, and, suggested, that, dinosaurs, could, enter, the, field, of, molecular, biology, and, really, slingshot, paleontology, into, the, modern, world, the, presumed, soft, tissue, was, called, into, question, by, thomas, kaye, of, the, university, of, washington, and, his, co, authors, in, 2008, they, contend, that, what, was, really, inside, the, tyrannosaur, bone, was, slimy, biofilm, created, by, bacteria, that, coated, the, voids, once, occupied, by, blood, vessels, and, cells, the, researchers, found, that, what, previously, had, been, identified, as, remnants, of, blood, cells, because, of, the, presence, of, iron, were, actually, framboids, microscopic, mineral, spheres, bearing, iron, they, found, similar, spheres, in, a, variety, of, other, fossils, from, various, periods, including, an, ammonite, in, the, ammonite, they, found, the, spheres, in, a, place, where, the, iron, they, contain, could, not, have, had, any, relationship, to, the, presence, of, blood, schweitzer, has, strongly, criticized, kaye, s, claims, and, argues, that, there, is, no, reported, evidence, that, biofilms, can, produce, branching, hollow, tubes, like, those, noted, in, her, study, san, antonio, schweitzer, and, colleagues, published, an, analysis, in, 2011, of, what, parts, of, the, collagen, had, been, recovered, finding, that, it, was, the, inner, parts, of, the, collagen, coil, that, had, been, preserved, as, would, have, been, expected, from, a, long, period, of, protein, degradation, other, research, challenges, the, identification, of, soft, tissue, as, biofilm, and, confirms, finding, branching, vessel, like, structures, from, within, fossilized, bone, scientists, have, produced, a, wide, range, of, possible, maximum, running, speeds, for, tyrannosaurus, mostly, around, 9, meters, per, second, 32, km, h, 20, mph, but, as, low, as, 4, 5, 6, 8, meters, per, second, 16, 24, km, h, 10, 15, mph, and, as, high, as, 20, meters, per, second, 72, km, h, 45, mph, though, it, running, this, speed, is, very, unlikely, tyrannosaurus, was, a, bulky, and, heavy, carnivore, so, it, is, unlikely, to, run, very, fast, at, all, compared, to, other, theropods, like, carnotaurus, or, giganotosaurus, researchers, have, relied, on, various, estimating, techniques, because, while, there, are, many, tracks, of, large, theropods, walking, none, showed, evidence, of, running, a, 2002, report, used, a, mathematical, model, validated, by, applying, it, to, three, living, animals, alligators, chickens, and, humans, and, eight, more, species, including, emus, and, ostriches, to, gauge, the, leg, muscle, mass, needed, for, fast, running, over, 40, km, h, or, 25, mph, scientists, who, think, that, tyrannosaurus, was, able, to, run, point, out, that, hollow, bones, and, other, features, that, would, have, lightened, its, body, may, have, kept, adult, weight, to, a, mere, 4, 5, metric, tons, 5, 0, short, tons, or, so, or, that, other, animals, like, ostriches, and, horses, with, long, flexible, legs, are, able, to, achieve, high, speeds, through, slower, but, longer, strides, proposed, top, speeds, exceeded, 40, kilometers, per, hour, 25, mph, for, tyrannosaurus, but, were, deemed, infeasible, because, they, would, require, exceptional, leg, muscles, of, approximately, 40, 86, of, total, body, mass, even, moderately, fast, speeds, would, have, required, large, leg, muscles, if, the, muscle, mass, was, less, only, 18, kilometers, per, hour, 11, mph, for, walking, or, jogging, would, have, been, possible, holtz, noted, that, tyrannosaurids, and, some, closely, related, groups, had, significantly, longer, distal, hindlimb, components, shin, plus, foot, plus, toes, relative, to, the, femur, length, than, most, other, theropods, and, that, tyrannosaurids, and, their, close, relatives, had, a, tightly, interlocked, metatarsus, foot, bones, the, third, metatarsal, was, squeezed, between, the, second, and, fourth, metatarsals, to, form, a, single, unit, called, an, arctometatarsus, this, ankle, feature, may, have, helped, the, animal, to, run, more, efficiently, together, these, leg, features, allowed, tyrannosaurus, to, transmit, locomotory, forces, from, the, foot, to, the, lower, leg, more, effectively, than, in, earlier, theropods, additionally, a, 2020, study, indicates, that, tyrannosaurus, and, other, tyrannosaurids, were, exceptionally, efficient, walkers, studies, by, dececchi, et, al, compared, the, leg, proportions, body, mass, and, the, gaits, of, more, than, 70, species, of, theropod, dinosaurs, including, tyrannosaurus, and, its, relatives, the, research, team, then, applied, a, variety, of, methods, to, estimate, each, dinosaur, s, top, speed, when, running, as, well, as, how, much, energy, each, dinosaur, expended, while, moving, at, more, relaxed, speeds, such, as, when, walking, among, smaller, to, medium, sized, species, such, as, dromaeosaurids, longer, legs, appear, to, be, an, adaptation, for, faster, running, in, line, with, previous, results, by, other, researchers, but, for, theropods, weighing, over, 1, 000, kg, 2, 200, lb, top, running, speed, is, limited, by, body, size, so, longer, legs, instead, were, found, to, have, correlated, with, low, energy, walking, the, results, further, indicate, that, smaller, theropods, evolved, long, legs, as, a, means, to, both, aid, in, hunting, and, escape, from, larger, predators, while, larger, theropods, that, evolved, long, legs, did, so, to, reduce, the, energy, costs, and, increase, foraging, efficiency, as, they, were, freed, from, the, demands, of, predation, pressure, due, to, their, role, as, apex, predators, compared, to, more, basal, groups, of, theropods, in, the, study, tyrannosaurs, like, tyrannosaurus, itself, showed, a, marked, increase, in, foraging, efficiency, due, to, reduced, energy, expenditures, during, hunting, or, scavenging, this, in, turn, likely, resulted, in, tyrannosaurs, having, a, reduced, need, for, hunting, forays, and, requiring, less, food, to, sustain, themselves, as, a, result, additionally, the, research, in, conjunction, with, studies, that, show, tyrannosaurs, were, more, agile, than, other, large, bodied, theropods, indicates, they, were, quite, well, adapted, to, a, long, distance, stalking, approach, followed, by, a, quick, burst, of, speed, to, go, for, the, kill, analogies, can, be, noted, between, tyrannosaurids, and, modern, wolves, as, a, result, supported, by, evidence, that, at, least, some, tyrannosaurids, were, hunting, in, group, settings, a, study, published, in, 2021, by, pasha, van, bijlert, et, al, calculated, the, preferred, walking, speed, of, tyrannosaurus, reporting, a, speed, of, 1, 28, meters, per, second, 4, 6, km, h, 2, 9, mph, while, walking, animals, reduce, their, energy, expenditure, by, choosing, certain, step, rhythms, at, which, their, body, parts, resonate, the, same, would, have, been, true, for, dinosaurs, but, previous, studies, did, not, fully, account, for, the, impact, the, tail, had, on, their, walking, speeds, according, to, the, authors, when, a, dinosaur, walked, its, tail, would, slightly, sway, up, and, down, with, each, step, as, a, result, of, the, interspinous, ligaments, suspending, the, tail, like, rubber, bands, these, ligaments, stored, energy, when, they, are, stretched, due, to, the, swaying, of, the, tail, using, a, 3, d, model, of, tyrannosaurus, specimen, trix, muscles, and, ligaments, were, reconstructed, to, simulate, the, tail, movements, this, results, in, a, rhythmic, energy, efficient, walking, speed, for, tyrannosaurus, similar, to, that, seen, in, living, animals, such, as, humans, ostriches, and, giraffes, a, 2017, study, estimated, the, top, running, speed, of, tyrannosaurus, as, 17, mph, 27, km, h, speculating, that, tyrannosaurus, exhausted, its, energy, reserves, long, before, reaching, top, speed, resulting, in, a, parabola, like, relationship, between, size, and, speed, another, 2017, study, hypothesized, that, an, adult, tyrannosaurus, was, incapable, of, running, due, to, high, skeletal, loads, using, a, calculated, weight, estimate, of, 7, tons, the, model, showed, that, speeds, above, 11, mph, 18, km, h, would, have, probably, shattered, the, leg, bones, of, tyrannosaurus, the, finding, may, mean, that, running, was, also, not, possible, for, other, giant, theropod, dinosaurs, like, giganotosaurus, mapusaurus, and, acrocanthosaurus, however, studies, by, eric, snively, and, colleagues, published, in, 2019, indicate, that, tyrannosaurus, and, other, tyrannosaurids, were, more, maneuverable, than, allosauroids, and, other, theropods, of, comparable, size, due, to, low, rotational, inertia, compared, to, their, body, mass, combined, with, large, leg, muscles, as, a, result, it, is, hypothesized, that, tyrannosaurus, was, capable, of, making, relatively, quick, turns, and, could, likely, pivot, its, body, more, quickly, when, close, to, its, prey, or, that, while, turning, the, theropod, could, pirouette, on, a, single, planted, foot, while, the, alternating, leg, was, held, out, in, a, suspended, swing, during, a, pursuit, the, results, of, this, study, potentially, could, shed, light, on, how, agility, could, have, contributed, to, the, success, of, tyrannosaurid, evolution, rare, fossil, footprints, and, trackways, found, in, new, mexico, and, wyoming, that, are, assigned, to, the, ichnogenus, tyrannosauripus, have, been, attributed, to, being, made, by, tyrannosaurus, based, on, the, stratigraphic, age, of, the, rocks, they, are, preserved, in, the, first, specimen, found, in, 1994, was, described, by, lockley, and, hunt, and, consists, of, a, single, large, footprint, another, pair, of, ichnofossils, described, in, 2021, show, a, large, tyrannosaurid, rising, from, a, prone, position, by, rising, up, using, its, elbows, in, conjunction, with, the, pads, on, their, feet, to, stand, these, two, unique, sets, of, fossils, were, found, in, ludlow, colorado, and, cimarron, new, mexico, another, ichnofossil, described, in, 2018, perhaps, belonging, to, a, juvenile, tyrannosaurus, or, the, dubious, genus, nanotyrannus, was, uncovered, in, the, lance, formation, of, wyoming, the, trackway, itself, offers, a, rare, glimpse, into, the, walking, speed, of, tyrannosaurids, and, the, trackmaker, is, estimated, to, have, been, moving, at, a, speed, of, 4, 5, 8, 0, kilometers, per, hour, 2, 8, 5, 0, mph, significantly, faster, than, previously, assumed, for, estimations, of, walking, speed, in, tyrannosaurids, a, study, conducted, by, lawrence, witmer, and, ryan, ridgely, of, ohio, university, found, that, tyrannosaurus, shared, the, heightened, sensory, abilities, of, other, coelurosaurs, highlighting, relatively, rapid, and, coordinated, eye, and, head, movements, an, enhanced, ability, to, sense, low, frequency, sounds, which, would, allow, tyrannosaurs, to, track, prey, movements, from, long, distances, and, an, enhanced, sense, of, smell, a, study, published, by, kent, stevens, concluded, that, tyrannosaurus, had, keen, vision, by, applying, modified, perimetry, to, facial, reconstructions, of, several, dinosaurs, including, tyrannosaurus, the, study, found, that, tyrannosaurus, had, a, binocular, range, of, 55, degrees, surpassing, that, of, modern, hawks, stevens, estimated, that, tyrannosaurus, had, 13, times, the, visual, acuity, of, a, human, and, surpassed, the, visual, acuity, of, an, eagle, which, is, 3, 6, times, that, of, a, person, stevens, estimated, a, limiting, far, point, that, is, the, distance, at, which, an, object, can, be, seen, as, separate, from, the, horizon, as, far, as, 6, km, 3, 7, mi, away, which, is, greater, than, the, 1, 6, km, 1, mi, that, a, human, can, see, thomas, holtz, jr, would, note, that, high, depth, perception, of, tyrannosaurus, may, have, been, due, to, the, prey, it, had, to, hunt, noting, that, it, had, to, hunt, ceratopsians, such, as, triceratops, ankylosaurs, such, as, ankylosaurus, and, hadrosaurs, he, would, suggest, that, this, made, precision, more, crucial, for, tyrannosaurus, enabling, it, to, get, in, get, that, blow, in, and, take, it, down, in, contrast, acrocanthosaurus, had, limited, depth, perception, because, they, hunted, large, sauropods, which, were, relatively, rare, during, the, time, of, tyrannosaurus, though, no, tyrannosaurus, sclerotic, ring, has, been, found, kenneth, carpenter, estimated, its, size, based, on, that, of, gorgosaurus, the, inferred, sclerotic, ring, for, the, stan, specimen, is, 7, cm, 2, 8, in, in, diameter, with, an, internal, aperture, diameter, of, 3, 5, cm, 1, 4, in, based, on, eye, proportions, in, living, reptiles, this, implies, a, pupil, diameter, of, about, 2, 5, cm, 0, 98, in, an, iris, diameter, about, that, of, the, sclerotic, ring, and, an, eyeball, diameter, of, 11, 12, cm, 4, 3, 4, 7, in, carpenter, also, estimated, an, eyeball, depth, of, 7, 7, 9, 6, cm, 3, 0, 3, 8, in, based, on, these, calculations, the, f, number, for, stan, s, eye, is, 3, 3, 8, since, diurnal, animals, have, f, numbers, of, 2, 1, or, higher, this, would, indicate, that, tyrannosaurus, had, poor, low, light, vision, and, hunted, during, the, day, tyrannosaurus, had, very, large, olfactory, bulbs, and, olfactory, nerves, relative, to, their, brain, size, the, organs, responsible, for, a, heightened, sense, of, smell, this, suggests, that, the, sense, of, smell, was, highly, developed, and, implies, that, tyrannosaurs, could, detect, carcasses, by, scent, alone, across, great, distances, the, sense, of, smell, in, tyrannosaurs, may, have, been, comparable, to, modern, vultures, which, use, scent, to, track, carcasses, for, scavenging, research, on, the, olfactory, bulbs, has, shown, that, t, rex, had, the, most, highly, developed, sense, of, smell, of, 21, sampled, non, avian, dinosaur, species, somewhat, unusually, among, theropods, t, rex, had, a, very, long, cochlea, the, length, of, the, cochlea, is, often, related, to, hearing, acuity, or, at, least, the, importance, of, hearing, in, behavior, implying, that, hearing, was, a, particularly, important, sense, to, tyrannosaurs, specifically, data, suggests, that, t, rex, heard, best, in, the, low, frequency, range, and, that, low, frequency, sounds, were, an, important, part, of, tyrannosaur, behavior, a, 2017, study, by, thomas, carr, and, colleagues, found, that, the, snout, of, tyrannosaurids, was, highly, sensitive, based, on, a, high, number, of, small, openings, in, the, facial, bones, of, the, related, daspletosaurus, that, contained, sensory, neurons, the, study, speculated, that, tyrannosaurs, might, have, used, their, sensitive, snouts, to, measure, the, temperature, of, their, nests, and, to, gently, pick, up, eggs, and, hatchlings, as, seen, in, modern, crocodylians, another, study, published, in, 2021, further, suggests, that, tyrannosaurus, had, an, acute, sense, of, touch, based, on, neurovascular, canals, in, the, front, of, its, jaws, which, it, could, utilize, to, better, detect, and, consume, prey, the, study, published, by, kawabe, and, hittori, et, al, suggests, that, tyrannosaurus, could, also, accurately, sense, slight, differences, in, material, and, movement, allowing, it, to, utilize, different, feeding, strategies, on, different, parts, of, its, prey, s, carcasses, depending, on, the, situation, the, sensitive, neurovascular, canals, of, tyrannosaurus, also, likely, were, adapted, to, performing, fine, movements, and, behaviors, such, as, nest, building, parental, care, and, other, social, behavior, such, as, intraspecific, communication, the, results, of, this, study, also, align, with, results, made, in, studying, the, related, tyrannosaurid, daspletosaurus, horneri, and, the, allosauroid, neovenator, which, have, similar, neurovascular, adaptations, suggesting, that, the, faces, of, theropods, were, highly, sensitive, to, pressure, and, touch, however, a, more, recent, study, reviewing, the, evolution, of, the, trigeminal, canals, among, sauropsids, notes, that, a, much, denser, network, of, neurovascular, canals, in, the, snout, and, lower, jaw, is, more, commonly, encountered, in, aquatic, or, semiaquatic, taxa, e, g, spinosaurus, halszkaraptor, plesiosaurus, and, taxa, that, developed, a, rhamphotheca, e, g, caenagnathasia, while, the, network, of, canals, in, tyrannosaurus, appears, simpler, though, still, more, derived, than, in, most, ornithischians, and, overall, terrestrial, taxa, such, as, tyrannosaurids, and, neovenator, may, have, had, average, facial, sensitivity, for, non, edentulous, terrestrial, theropods, although, further, research, is, needed, the, neurovascular, canals, in, tyrannosaurus, may, instead, have, supported, soft, tissue, structures, for, thermoregulation, or, social, signaling, the, latter, of, which, could, be, confirmed, by, the, fact, that, the, neurovascular, network, of, canals, may, have, changed, during, ontogeny, a, study, by, grant, r, hurlburt, ryan, c, ridgely, and, lawrence, witmer, obtained, estimates, for, encephalization, quotients, eqs, based, on, reptiles, and, birds, as, well, as, estimates, for, the, ratio, of, cerebrum, to, brain, mass, the, study, concluded, that, tyrannosaurus, had, the, relatively, largest, brain, of, all, adult, non, avian, dinosaurs, with, the, exception, of, certain, small, maniraptoriforms, bambiraptor, troodon, and, ornithomimus, the, study, found, that, tyrannosaurus, s, relative, brain, size, was, still, within, the, range, of, modern, reptiles, being, at, most, 2, standard, deviations, above, the, mean, of, non, avian, reptile, eqs, the, estimates, for, the, ratio, of, cerebrum, mass, to, brain, mass, would, range, from, 47, 5, to, 49, 53, percent, according, to, the, study, this, is, more, than, the, lowest, estimates, for, extant, birds, 44, 6, percent, but, still, close, to, the, typical, ratios, of, the, smallest, sexually, mature, alligators, which, range, from, 45, 9, 47, 9, percent, other, studies, such, as, those, by, steve, brusatte, indicate, the, encephalization, quotient, of, tyrannosaurus, was, similar, in, range, 2, 0, 2, 4, to, a, chimpanzee, 2, 2, 2, 5, though, this, may, be, debatable, as, reptilian, and, mammalian, encephalization, quotients, are, not, equivalent, philip, j, currie, suggested, that, tyrannosaurus, may, have, been, pack, hunters, comparing, t, rex, to, related, species, tarbosaurus, bataar, and, albertosaurus, sarcophagus, citing, fossil, evidence, that, may, indicate, gregarious, describing, animals, that, travel, in, herds, or, packs, behavior, a, find, in, south, dakota, where, three, t, rex, skeletons, were, in, close, proximity, may, suggest, the, formation, of, a, pack, cooperative, pack, hunting, may, have, been, an, effective, strategy, for, subduing, prey, with, advanced, anti, predator, adaptations, which, pose, potential, lethality, such, as, triceratops, and, ankylosaurus, currie, s, pack, hunting, t, rex, hypothesis, has, been, criticized, for, not, having, been, peer, reviewed, but, rather, was, discussed, in, a, television, interview, and, book, called, dino, gangs, the, currie, theory, for, pack, hunting, by, t, rex, is, based, mainly, by, analogy, to, a, different, species, tarbosaurus, bataar, evidence, of, gregariousness, in, t, bataar, itself, has, not, been, peer, reviewed, and, to, currie, s, own, admission, can, only, be, interpreted, with, reference, to, evidence, in, other, closely, related, species, according, to, currie, gregariousness, in, albertosaurus, sarcophagus, is, supported, by, the, discovery, of, 26, individuals, with, varied, ages, in, the, dry, island, bonebed, he, ruled, out, the, possibility, of, a, predator, trap, due, to, the, similar, preservation, state, of, individuals, and, the, near, absence, of, herbivores, additional, support, of, tyrannosaurid, gregariousness, can, be, found, in, fossilized, trackways, from, the, upper, cretaceous, wapiti, formation, of, northeastern, british, columbia, canada, left, by, three, tyrannosaurids, traveling, in, the, same, direction, according, to, scientists, assessing, the, dino, gangs, program, the, evidence, for, pack, hunting, in, tarbosaurus, and, albertosaurus, is, weak, and, based, on, group, skeletal, remains, for, which, alternate, explanations, may, apply, such, as, drought, or, a, flood, forcing, dinosaurs, to, die, together, in, one, place, others, researchers, have, speculated, that, instead, of, large, theropod, social, groups, some, of, these, finds, represent, behavior, more, akin, to, komodo, dragon, like, mobbing, of, carcasses, even, going, as, far, as, to, say, true, pack, hunting, behavior, may, not, exist, in, any, non, avian, dinosaurs, due, to, its, rarity, in, modern, predators, evidence, of, intraspecific, attack, was, found, by, joseph, peterson, and, his, colleagues, in, the, juvenile, tyrannosaurus, nicknamed, jane, peterson, and, his, team, found, that, jane, s, skull, showed, healed, puncture, wounds, on, the, upper, jaw, and, snout, which, they, believe, came, from, another, juvenile, tyrannosaurus, subsequent, ct, scans, of, jane, s, skull, would, further, confirm, the, team, s, hypothesis, showing, that, the, puncture, wounds, came, from, a, traumatic, injury, and, that, there, was, subsequent, healing, the, team, would, also, state, that, jane, s, injuries, were, structurally, different, from, the, parasite, induced, lesions, found, in, sue, and, that, jane, s, injuries, were, on, its, face, whereas, the, parasite, that, infected, sue, caused, lesions, to, the, lower, jaw, pathologies, of, other, tyrannosaurus, specimens, have, been, suggested, as, evidence, of, conspecific, attack, including, wyrex, with, a, hole, penetrating, its, jugual, and, severe, trauma, on, its, tail, that, shows, signs, of, bone, remodeling, not, regrowth, most, paleontologists, accept, that, tyrannosaurus, was, both, an, active, predator, and, a, scavenger, like, most, large, carnivores, by, far, the, largest, carnivore, in, its, environment, t, rex, was, most, likely, an, apex, predator, preying, upon, hadrosaurs, armored, herbivores, like, ceratopsians, and, ankylosaurs, and, possibly, sauropods, a, study, in, 2012, by, karl, bates, and, peter, falkingham, found, that, tyrannosaurus, had, the, most, powerful, bite, of, any, terrestrial, animal, that, has, ever, lived, finding, an, adult, tyrannosaurus, could, have, exerted, 35, 000, to, 57, 000, n, 7, 868, to, 12, 814, lbf, of, force, in, the, back, teeth, even, higher, estimates, were, made, by, mason, b, meers, in, 2003, this, allowed, it, to, crush, bones, during, repetitive, biting, and, fully, consume, the, carcasses, of, large, dinosaurs, stephan, lautenschlager, and, colleagues, calculated, that, tyrannosaurus, was, capable, of, a, maximum, jaw, gape, of, around, 80, degrees, a, necessary, adaptation, for, a, wide, range, of, jaw, angles, to, power, the, creature, s, strong, bite, a, debate, exists, however, about, whether, tyrannosaurus, was, primarily, a, predator, or, a, pure, scavenger, the, debate, originated, in, a, 1917, study, by, lambe, which, argued, that, large, theropods, were, pure, scavengers, because, gorgosaurus, teeth, showed, hardly, any, wear, this, argument, disregarded, the, fact, that, theropods, replaced, their, teeth, quite, rapidly, ever, since, the, first, discovery, of, tyrannosaurus, most, scientists, have, speculated, that, it, was, a, predator, like, modern, large, predators, it, would, readily, scavenge, or, steal, another, predator, s, kill, if, it, had, the, opportunity, paleontologist, jack, horner, has, been, a, major, proponent, of, the, view, that, tyrannosaurus, was, not, a, predator, at, all, but, instead, was, exclusively, a, scavenger, he, has, put, forward, arguments, in, the, popular, literature, to, support, the, pure, scavenger, hypothesis, other, evidence, suggests, hunting, behavior, in, tyrannosaurus, the, eye, sockets, of, tyrannosaurs, are, positioned, so, that, the, eyes, would, point, forward, giving, them, binocular, vision, slightly, better, than, that, of, modern, hawks, it, is, not, obvious, why, natural, selection, would, have, favored, this, long, term, trend, if, tyrannosaurs, had, been, pure, scavengers, which, would, not, have, needed, the, advanced, depth, perception, that, stereoscopic, vision, provides, in, modern, animals, binocular, vision, is, found, mainly, in, predators, a, skeleton, of, the, hadrosaurid, edmontosaurus, annectens, has, been, described, from, montana, with, healed, tyrannosaur, inflicted, damage, on, its, tail, vertebrae, the, fact, that, the, damage, seems, to, have, healed, suggests, that, the, edmontosaurus, survived, a, tyrannosaur, s, attack, on, a, living, target, i, e, the, tyrannosaur, had, attempted, active, predation, despite, the, consensus, that, the, tail, bites, were, caused, by, tyrannosaurus, there, has, been, some, evidence, to, show, that, they, might, have, been, created, by, other, factors, for, example, a, 2014, study, suggested, that, the, tail, injuries, might, have, been, due, to, edmontosaurus, individuals, stepping, on, each, other, while, another, study, in, 2020, backs, up, the, hypothesis, that, biomechanical, stress, is, the, cause, for, the, tail, injuries, there, is, also, evidence, for, an, aggressive, interaction, between, a, triceratops, and, a, tyrannosaurus, in, the, form, of, partially, healed, tyrannosaur, tooth, marks, on, a, triceratops, brow, horn, and, squamosal, a, bone, of, the, neck, frill, the, bitten, horn, is, also, broken, with, new, bone, growth, after, the, break, it, is, not, known, what, the, exact, nature, of, the, interaction, was, though, either, animal, could, have, been, the, aggressor, since, the, triceratops, wounds, healed, it, is, most, likely, that, the, triceratops, survived, the, encounter, and, managed, to, overcome, the, tyrannosaurus, in, a, battle, against, a, bull, triceratops, the, triceratops, would, likely, defend, itself, by, inflicting, fatal, wounds, to, the, tyrannosaurus, using, its, sharp, horns, studies, of, sue, found, a, broken, and, healed, fibula, and, tail, vertebrae, scarred, facial, bones, and, a, tooth, from, another, tyrannosaurus, embedded, in, a, neck, vertebra, providing, evidence, for, aggressive, behavior, studies, on, hadrosaur, vertebrae, from, the, hell, creek, formation, that, were, punctured, by, the, teeth, of, what, appears, to, be, a, late, stage, juvenile, tyrannosaurus, indicate, that, despite, lacking, the, bone, crushing, adaptations, of, the, adults, young, individuals, were, still, capable, of, using, the, same, bone, puncturing, feeding, technique, as, their, adult, counterparts, tyrannosaurus, may, have, had, infectious, saliva, used, to, kill, its, prey, as, proposed, by, william, abler, in, 1992, abler, observed, that, the, serrations, tiny, protuberances, on, the, cutting, edges, of, the, teeth, are, closely, spaced, enclosing, little, chambers, these, chambers, might, have, trapped, pieces, of, carcass, with, bacteria, giving, tyrannosaurus, a, deadly, infectious, bite, much, like, the, komodo, dragon, was, thought, to, have, jack, horner, and, don, lessem, in, a, 1993, popular, book, questioned, abler, s, hypothesis, arguing, that, tyrannosaurus, s, tooth, serrations, as, more, like, cubes, in, shape, than, the, serrations, on, a, komodo, monitor, s, teeth, which, are, rounded, 214, 215, tyrannosaurus, and, most, other, theropods, probably, primarily, processed, carcasses, with, lateral, shakes, of, the, head, like, crocodilians, the, head, was, not, as, maneuverable, as, the, skulls, of, allosauroids, due, to, flat, joints, of, the, neck, vertebrae, evidence, also, strongly, suggests, that, tyrannosaurs, were, at, least, occasionally, cannibalistic, tyrannosaurus, itself, has, strong, evidence, pointing, towards, it, having, been, cannibalistic, in, at, least, a, scavenging, capacity, based, on, tooth, marks, on, the, foot, bones, humerus, and, metatarsals, of, one, specimen, fossils, from, the, fruitland, formation, kirtland, formation, both, campanian, in, age, and, the, maastrichtian, aged, ojo, alamo, formation, suggest, that, cannibalism, was, present, in, various, tyrannosaurid, genera, of, the, san, juan, basin, the, evidence, gathered, from, the, specimens, suggests, opportunistic, feeding, behavior, in, tyrannosaurids, that, cannibalized, members, of, their, own, species, a, study, from, currie, horner, erickson, and, longrich, in, 2010, has, been, put, forward, as, evidence, of, cannibalism, in, the, genus, tyrannosaurus, they, studied, some, tyrannosaurus, specimens, with, tooth, marks, in, the, bones, attributable, to, the, same, genus, the, tooth, marks, were, identified, in, the, humerus, foot, bones, and, metatarsals, and, this, was, seen, as, evidence, for, opportunistic, scavenging, rather, than, wounds, caused, by, intraspecific, combat, in, a, fight, they, proposed, it, would, be, difficult, to, reach, down, to, bite, in, the, feet, of, a, rival, making, it, more, likely, that, the, bitemarks, were, made, in, a, carcass, as, the, bitemarks, were, made, in, body, parts, with, relatively, scantly, amounts, of, flesh, it, is, suggested, that, the, tyrannosaurus, was, feeding, on, a, cadaver, in, which, the, more, fleshy, parts, already, had, been, consumed, they, were, also, open, to, the, possibility, that, other, tyrannosaurids, practiced, cannibalism, while, there, is, no, direct, evidence, of, tyrannosaurus, raising, their, young, the, rarity, of, juvenile, and, nest, tyrannosaur, fossils, has, left, researchers, guessing, it, has, been, suggested, by, some, that, like, its, closest, living, relatives, modern, archosaurs, birds, and, crocodiles, tyrannosaurus, may, have, protected, and, fed, its, young, crocodilians, and, birds, are, often, suggested, by, some, paleontologists, to, be, modern, analogues, for, dinosaur, parenting, direct, evidence, of, parental, behavior, exists, in, other, dinosaurs, such, as, maiasaura, peeblesorum, the, first, dinosaur, to, have, been, discovered, to, raise, its, young, as, well, as, more, closely, related, oviraptorids, the, latter, suggesting, parental, behavior, in, theropods, in, 2001, bruce, rothschild, and, others, published, a, study, examining, evidence, for, stress, fractures, and, tendon, avulsions, in, theropod, dinosaurs, and, the, implications, for, their, behavior, since, stress, fractures, are, caused, by, repeated, trauma, rather, than, singular, events, they, are, more, likely, to, be, caused, by, regular, behavior, than, other, types, of, injuries, of, the, 81, tyrannosaurus, foot, bones, examined, in, the, study, one, was, found, to, have, a, stress, fracture, while, none, of, the, 10, hand, bones, were, found, to, have, stress, fractures, the, researchers, found, tendon, avulsions, only, among, tyrannosaurus, and, allosaurus, an, avulsion, injury, left, a, divot, on, the, humerus, of, sue, the, t, rex, apparently, located, at, the, origin, of, the, deltoid, or, teres, major, muscles, the, presence, of, avulsion, injuries, being, limited, to, the, forelimb, and, shoulder, in, both, tyrannosaurus, and, allosaurus, suggests, that, theropods, may, have, had, a, musculature, more, complex, than, and, functionally, different, from, those, of, birds, the, researchers, concluded, that, sue, s, tendon, avulsion, was, probably, obtained, from, struggling, prey, the, presence, of, stress, fractures, and, tendon, avulsions, in, general, provides, evidence, for, a, very, active, predation, based, diet, rather, than, obligate, scavenging, a, 2009, study, showed, that, smooth, edged, holes, in, the, skulls, of, several, specimens, might, have, been, caused, by, trichomonas, like, parasites, that, commonly, infect, birds, according, to, the, study, seriously, infected, individuals, including, sue, and, mor, 980, peck, s, rex, might, therefore, have, died, from, starvation, after, feeding, became, increasingly, difficult, previously, these, holes, had, been, explained, by, the, bacterious, bone, infection, actinomycosis, or, by, intraspecific, attacks, a, subsequent, study, found, that, while, trichomoniasis, has, many, attributes, of, the, model, proposed, osteolytic, intra, oral, several, features, make, the, assumption, that, it, was, the, cause, of, death, less, supportable, by, evidence, for, example, the, observed, sharp, margins, with, little, reactive, bone, shown, by, the, radiographs, of, trichomonas, infected, birds, are, dissimilar, to, the, reactive, bone, seen, in, the, affected, t, rex, specimens, also, trichomoniasis, can, be, very, rapidly, fatal, in, birds, 14, days, or, less, albeit, in, its, milder, form, and, this, suggests, that, if, a, trichomonas, like, protozoan, is, the, culprit, trichomoniasis, was, less, acute, in, its, non, avian, dinosaur, form, during, the, late, cretaceous, finally, the, relative, size, of, this, type, of, lesions, is, much, larger, in, small, bird, throats, and, may, not, have, been, enough, to, choke, a, t, rex, a, more, recent, study, examining, the, pathologies, concluded, that, the, osseous, alteration, observed, most, closely, resembles, those, around, healing, human, cranial, trepanations, and, healing, fractures, in, the, triassic, reptile, stagonolepis, in, the, absence, of, infection, the, possible, cause, may, instead, have, been, intraspecific, combat, one, study, of, tyrannosaurus, specimens, with, tooth, marks, in, the, bones, attributable, to, the, same, genus, was, presented, as, evidence, of, cannibalism, tooth, marks, in, the, humerus, foot, bones, and, metatarsals, may, indicate, opportunistic, scavenging, rather, than, wounds, caused, by, combat, with, another, t, rex, other, tyrannosaurids, may, also, have, practiced, cannibalism, tyrannosaurus, lived, during, what, is, referred, to, as, the, lancian, faunal, stage, maastrichtian, age, at, the, end, of, the, late, cretaceous, tyrannosaurus, ranged, from, canada, in, the, north, to, at, least, new, mexico, in, the, south, of, laramidia, during, this, time, triceratops, was, the, major, herbivore, in, the, northern, portion, of, its, range, while, the, titanosaurian, sauropod, alamosaurus, dominated, its, southern, range, tyrannosaurus, remains, have, been, discovered, in, different, ecosystems, including, inland, and, coastal, subtropical, and, semi, arid, plains, several, notable, tyrannosaurus, remains, have, been, found, in, the, hell, creek, formation, during, the, maastrichtian, this, area, was, subtropical, with, a, warm, and, humid, climate, the, flora, consisted, mostly, of, angiosperms, but, also, included, trees, like, dawn, redwood, metasequoia, and, araucaria, tyrannosaurus, shared, this, ecosystem, with, ceratopsians, leptoceratops, torosaurus, and, triceratops, the, hadrosaurid, edmontosaurus, annectens, the, parksosaurid, thescelosaurus, the, ankylosaurs, ankylosaurus, and, denversaurus, the, pachycephalosaurs, pachycephalosaurus, and, sphaerotholus, and, the, theropods, ornithomimus, struthiomimus, acheroraptor, dakotaraptor, pectinodon, and, anzu, another, formation, with, tyrannosaurus, remains, is, the, lance, formation, of, wyoming, this, has, been, interpreted, as, a, bayou, environment, similar, to, today, s, gulf, coast, the, fauna, was, very, similar, to, hell, creek, but, with, struthiomimus, replacing, its, relative, ornithomimus, the, small, ceratopsian, leptoceratops, also, lived, in, the, area, in, its, southern, range, specifically, based, on, remains, discovered, from, the, north, horn, formation, of, utah, tyrannosaurus, rex, lived, alongside, the, titanosaur, alamosaurus, the, ceratopsid, torosaurus, and, the, indeterminate, troodontids, and, hadrosaurids, tyrannosaurus, mcraeensis, from, the, mcrae, group, of, new, mexico, coexisted, with, the, ceratopsid, sierraceratops, and, possibly, the, titanosaur, alamosaurus, potential, remains, identified, as, cf, tyrannosaurus, have, also, been, discovered, from, the, javelina, formation, of, texas, where, the, remains, of, the, titanosaur, alamosaurus, the, ceratopsid, bravoceratops, the, pterosaurs, quetzalcoatlus, and, wellnhopterus, and, possible, species, of, troodontids, and, hadrosaurids, are, found, its, southern, range, is, thought, to, have, been, dominated, by, semi, arid, inland, plains, following, the, probable, retreat, of, the, western, interior, seaway, as, global, sea, levels, fell, tyrannosaurus, may, have, also, inhabited, mexico, s, lomas, coloradas, formation, in, sonora, though, skeletal, evidence, is, lacking, six, shed, and, broken, teeth, from, the, fossil, bed, have, been, thoroughly, compared, with, other, theropod, genera, and, appear, to, be, identical, to, those, of, tyrannosaurus, if, true, the, evidence, indicates, the, range, of, tyrannosaurus, was, possibly, more, extensive, than, previously, believed, it, is, possible, that, tyrannosaurs, were, originally, asian, species, migrating, to, north, america, before, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, according, to, studies, published, in, 2021, by, charles, marshall, et, al, the, total, population, of, adult, tyrannosaurus, at, any, given, time, was, perhaps, 20, 000, individuals, with, computer, estimations, also, suggesting, a, total, population, no, lower, than, 1, 300, and, no, higher, than, 328, 000, the, authors, themselves, suggest, that, the, estimate, of, 20, 000, individuals, is, probably, lower, than, what, should, be, expected, especially, when, factoring, in, that, disease, pandemics, could, easily, wipe, out, such, a, small, population, over, the, span, of, the, genus, existence, it, is, estimated, that, there, were, about, 127, 000, generations, and, that, this, added, up, to, a, total, of, roughly, 2, 5, billion, animals, until, their, extinction, in, the, same, paper, it, is, suggested, that, in, a, population, of, tyrannosaurus, adults, numbering, 20, 000, the, number, of, individuals, living, in, an, area, the, size, of, california, could, be, as, high, as, 3, 800, animals, while, an, area, the, size, of, washington, d, c, could, support, a, population, of, only, two, adult, tyrannosaurus, the, study, does, not, take, into, account, the, number, of, juvenile, animals, in, the, genus, present, in, this, population, estimate, due, to, their, occupation, of, a, different, niche, than, the, adults, and, thus, it, is, likely, the, total, population, was, much, higher, when, accounting, for, this, factor, simultaneously, studies, of, living, carnivores, suggest, that, some, predator, populations, are, higher, in, density, than, others, of, similar, weight, such, as, jaguars, and, hyenas, which, are, similar, in, weight, but, have, vastly, differing, population, densities, lastly, the, study, suggests, that, in, most, cases, only, one, in, 80, million, tyrannosaurus, would, become, fossilized, while, the, chances, were, likely, as, high, as, one, in, every, 16, 000, of, an, individual, becoming, fossilized, in, areas, that, had, more, dense, populations, meiri, 2022, questioned, the, reliability, of, the, estimates, citing, uncertainty, in, metabolic, rate, body, size, sex, and, age, specific, survival, rates, habitat, requirements, and, range, size, variability, as, shortcomings, marshall, et, al, did, not, take, into, account, the, authors, of, the, original, publication, replied, that, while, they, agree, that, their, reported, uncertainties, were, probably, too, small, their, framework, is, flexible, enough, to, accommodate, uncerainty, in, physiology, and, that, their, calculations, do, not, depend, on, short, term, changes, in, population, density, and, geographic, range, but, rather, on, their, long, term, averages, finally, they, remark, that, they, did, estimate, the, range, of, reasonable, survivorship, curves, and, that, they, did, include, uncertainty, in, the, time, of, onset, of, sexual, maturity, and, in, the, growth, curve, by, incorporating, the, uncertainty, in, the, maximum, body, mass, since, it, was, first, described, in, 1905, t, rex, has, become, the, most, widely, recognized, dinosaur, species, in, popular, culture, it, is, the, only, dinosaur, that, is, commonly, known, to, the, general, public, by, its, full, scientific, name, binomial, name, and, the, scientific, abbreviation, t, rex, has, also, come, into, wide, usage, robert, t, bakker, notes, this, in, the, dinosaur, heresies, and, explains, that, a, name, like, t, rex, is, just, irresistible, to, the, tongue
