bubonic, plague, is, one, of, three, types, of, plague, caused, by, the, bacterium, yersinia, pestis, one, to, seven, days, after, exposure, to, the, bacteria, flu, like, symptoms, develop, these, symptoms, include, fever, headaches, and, vomiting, as, well, as, swollen, and, painful, lymph, nodes, occurring, in, the, area, closest, to, where, the, bacteria, entered, the, skin, acral, necrosis, the, dark, discoloration, of, skin, is, another, symptom, occasionally, swollen, lymph, nodes, known, as, buboes, may, break, open, the, three, types, of, plague, are, the, result, of, the, route, of, infection, bubonic, plague, septicemic, plague, and, pneumonic, plague, bubonic, plague, is, mainly, spread, by, infected, fleas, from, small, animals, it, may, also, result, from, exposure, to, the, body, fluids, from, a, dead, plague, infected, animal, mammals, such, as, rabbits, hares, and, some, cat, species, are, susceptible, to, bubonic, plague, and, typically, die, upon, contraction, in, the, bubonic, form, of, plague, the, bacteria, enter, through, the, skin, through, a, flea, bite, and, travel, via, the, lymphatic, vessels, to, a, lymph, node, causing, it, to, swell, diagnosis, is, made, by, finding, the, bacteria, in, the, blood, sputum, or, fluid, from, lymph, nodes, prevention, is, through, public, health, measures, such, as, not, handling, dead, animals, in, areas, where, plague, is, common, while, vaccines, against, the, plague, have, been, developed, the, world, health, organization, recommends, that, only, high, risk, groups, such, as, certain, laboratory, personnel, and, health, care, workers, get, inoculated, several, antibiotics, are, effective, for, treatment, including, streptomycin, gentamicin, and, doxycycline, without, treatment, plague, results, in, the, death, of, 30, to, 90, of, those, infected, death, if, it, occurs, is, typically, within, 10, days, with, treatment, the, risk, of, death, is, around, 10, globally, between, 2010, and, 2015, there, were, 3, 248, documented, cases, which, resulted, in, 584, deaths, the, countries, with, the, greatest, number, of, cases, are, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, madagascar, and, peru, the, plague, is, considered, the, likely, cause, of, the, black, death, that, swept, through, asia, europe, and, africa, in, the, 14th, century, and, killed, an, estimated, 50, million, people, including, about, 25, to, 60, of, the, european, population, because, the, plague, killed, so, many, of, the, working, population, wages, rose, due, to, the, demand, for, labor, some, historians, see, this, as, a, turning, point, in, european, economic, development, the, disease, is, also, considered, to, have, been, responsible, for, the, plague, of, justinian, originating, in, the, eastern, roman, empire, in, the, 6th, century, ce, as, well, as, the, third, epidemic, affecting, china, mongolia, and, india, originating, in, the, yunnan, province, in, 1855, the, term, bubonic, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, meaning, groin, the, bubonic, plague, is, an, infection, of, the, lymphatic, system, usually, resulting, from, the, bite, of, an, infected, flea, xenopsylla, cheopis, the, oriental, rat, flea, several, flea, species, carried, the, bubonic, plague, such, as, pulex, irritans, the, human, flea, xenopsylla, cheopis, and, ceratophyllus, fasciatus, xenopsylla, cheopis, was, the, most, effective, flea, species, for, transmission, the, flea, is, parasitic, on, house, and, field, rats, and, seeks, out, other, prey, when, its, rodent, host, dies, rats, were, an, amplifying, factor, to, bubonic, plague, due, to, their, common, association, with, humans, as, well, as, the, nature, of, their, blood, the, rat, s, blood, allows, the, rat, to, withstand, a, major, concentration, of, the, plague, the, bacteria, form, aggregates, in, the, gut, of, infected, fleas, and, this, results, in, the, flea, regurgitating, ingested, blood, which, is, now, infected, into, the, bite, site, of, a, rodent, or, human, host, once, established, the, bacteria, rapidly, spread, to, the, lymph, nodes, of, the, host, and, multiply, the, fleas, that, transmit, the, disease, only, directly, infect, humans, when, the, rat, population, in, the, area, is, wiped, out, from, a, mass, infection, furthermore, in, areas, with, a, large, population, of, rats, the, animals, can, harbor, low, levels, of, the, plague, infection, without, causing, human, outbreaks, with, no, new, rat, inputs, being, added, to, the, population, from, other, areas, the, infection, only, spread, to, humans, in, very, rare, cases, of, overcrowding, after, being, transmitted, via, the, bite, of, an, infected, flea, the, y, pestis, bacteria, become, localized, in, an, inflamed, lymph, node, where, they, begin, to, colonize, and, reproduce, infected, lymph, nodes, develop, hemorrhages, which, result, in, the, death, of, tissue, y, pestis, bacilli, can, resist, phagocytosis, and, even, reproduce, inside, phagocytes, and, kill, them, as, the, disease, progresses, the, lymph, nodes, can, hemorrhage, and, become, swollen, and, necrotic, bubonic, plague, can, progress, to, lethal, septicemic, plague, in, some, cases, the, plague, is, also, known, to, spread, to, the, lungs, and, become, the, disease, known, as, the, pneumonic, plague, symptoms, appear, two, seven, days, after, getting, bitten, and, they, include, the, best, known, symptom, of, bubonic, plague, is, one, or, more, infected, enlarged, and, painful, lymph, nodes, known, as, buboes, buboes, associated, with, the, bubonic, plague, are, commonly, found, in, the, armpits, upper, femoral, area, groin, and, neck, region, these, buboes, will, grow, and, become, more, painful, over, time, often, to, the, point, of, bursting, symptoms, include, heavy, breathing, continuous, vomiting, of, blood, hematemesis, aching, limbs, coughing, and, extreme, pain, caused, by, the, decay, or, decomposition, of, the, skin, while, the, person, is, still, alive, additional, symptoms, include, extreme, fatigue, gastrointestinal, problems, spleen, inflammation, lenticulae, black, dots, scattered, throughout, the, body, delirium, coma, organ, failure, and, death, organ, failure, is, a, result, of, the, bacteria, infecting, organs, through, the, bloodstream, other, forms, of, the, disease, include, septicemic, plague, and, pneumonic, plague, in, which, the, bacterium, reproduces, in, the, person, s, blood, and, lungs, respectively, laboratory, testing, is, required, in, order, to, diagnose, and, confirm, plague, ideally, confirmation, is, through, the, identification, of, y, pestis, culture, from, a, patient, sample, confirmation, of, infection, can, be, done, by, examining, serum, taken, during, the, early, and, late, stages, of, infection, to, quickly, screen, for, the, y, pestis, antigen, in, patients, rapid, dipstick, tests, have, been, developed, for, field, use, samples, taken, for, testing, include, bubonic, plague, outbreaks, are, controlled, by, pest, control, and, modern, sanitation, techniques, this, disease, uses, fleas, commonly, found, on, rats, as, a, vector, to, jump, from, animals, to, humans, the, mortality, rate, is, highest, in, the, summer, and, early, fall, the, successful, control, of, rat, populations, in, dense, urban, areas, is, essential, to, outbreak, prevention, one, example, is, the, use, of, a, machine, called, the, sulfurozador, used, to, deliver, sulphur, dioxide, to, eradicate, the, pest, that, spread, the, bubonic, plague, in, buenos, aires, argentina, during, the, early, 18th, century, targeted, chemoprophylaxis, sanitation, and, vector, control, also, played, a, role, in, controlling, the, 2003, oran, outbreak, of, the, bubonic, plague, another, means, of, prevention, in, large, european, cities, was, a, city, wide, quarantine, to, not, only, limit, interaction, with, people, who, were, infected, but, also, to, limit, the, interaction, with, the, infected, rats, several, classes, of, antibiotic, are, effective, in, treating, bubonic, plague, these, include, aminoglycosides, such, as, streptomycin, and, gentamicin, tetracyclines, especially, doxycycline, and, the, fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin, mortality, associated, with, treated, cases, of, bubonic, plague, is, about, 1, 15, compared, to, a, mortality, of, 40, 60, in, untreated, cases, people, potentially, infected, with, the, plague, need, immediate, treatment, and, should, be, given, antibiotics, within, 24, hours, of, the, first, symptoms, to, prevent, death, other, treatments, include, oxygen, intravenous, fluids, and, respiratory, support, people, who, have, had, contact, with, anyone, infected, by, pneumonic, plague, are, given, prophylactic, antibiotics, using, the, broad, based, antibiotic, streptomycin, has, proven, to, be, dramatically, successful, against, the, bubonic, plague, within, 12, hours, of, infection, globally, between, 2010, and, 2015, there, were, 3, 248, documented, cases, which, resulted, in, 584, deaths, the, countries, with, the, greatest, number, of, cases, are, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, madagascar, and, peru, for, over, a, decade, since, 2001, zambia, india, malawi, algeria, china, peru, and, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, had, the, most, plague, cases, with, over, 1, 100, cases, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, alone, from, 1, 000, to, 2, 000, cases, are, conservatively, reported, per, year, to, the, who, from, 2012, to, 2017, reflecting, political, unrest, and, poor, hygienic, conditions, madagascar, began, to, host, regular, epidemics, between, 1900, and, 2015, the, united, states, had, 1, 036, human, plague, cases, with, an, average, of, 9, cases, per, year, in, 2015, 16, people, in, the, western, united, states, developed, plague, including, 2, cases, in, yosemite, national, park, these, us, cases, usually, occur, in, rural, northern, new, mexico, northern, arizona, southern, colorado, california, southern, oregon, and, far, western, nevada, in, november, 2017, the, madagascar, ministry, of, health, reported, an, outbreak, to, the, who, world, health, organization, with, more, cases, and, deaths, than, any, recent, outbreak, in, the, country, unusually, most, of, the, cases, were, pneumonic, rather, than, bubonic, in, june, 2018, a, child, was, confirmed, to, be, the, first, person, in, idaho, to, be, infected, by, bubonic, plague, in, nearly, 30, years, a, couple, died, in, may, 2019, in, mongolia, while, hunting, marmots, another, two, people, in, the, province, of, inner, mongolia, china, were, treated, in, november, 2019, for, the, disease, in, july, 2020, in, bayannur, inner, mongolia, of, china, a, human, case, of, bubonic, plague, was, reported, officials, responded, by, activating, a, city, wide, plague, prevention, system, for, the, remainder, of, the, year, also, in, july, 2020, in, mongolia, a, teenager, died, from, bubonic, plague, after, consuming, infected, marmot, meat, yersinia, pestis, has, been, discovered, in, archaeological, finds, from, the, late, bronze, age, 3800, bp, the, bacteria, is, identified, by, ancient, dna, in, human, teeth, from, asia, and, europe, dating, from, 2, 800, to, 5, 000, years, ago, some, authors, have, suggested, that, the, plague, was, responsible, for, the, neolithic, decline, the, first, recorded, epidemic, affected, the, sasanian, empire, and, their, arch, rivals, the, eastern, roman, empire, byzantine, empire, and, was, named, the, plague, of, justinian, 541, 549, ad, after, emperor, justinian, i, who, was, infected, but, survived, through, extensive, treatment, the, pandemic, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, an, estimated, 25, million, 6th, century, outbreak, to, 50, million, people, two, centuries, of, recurrence, the, historian, procopius, wrote, in, volume, ii, of, history, of, the, wars, of, his, personal, encounter, with, the, plague, and, the, effect, it, had, on, the, rising, empire, in, the, spring, of, 542, the, plague, arrived, in, constantinople, working, its, way, from, port, city, to, port, city, and, spreading, around, the, mediterranean, sea, later, migrating, inland, eastward, into, asia, minor, and, west, into, greece, and, italy, the, plague, of, justinian, is, said, to, have, been, completed, in, the, middle, of, the, 8th, century, because, the, infectious, disease, spread, inland, by, the, transferring, of, merchandise, through, justinian, s, efforts, in, acquiring, luxurious, goods, of, the, time, and, exporting, supplies, his, capital, became, the, leading, exporter, of, the, bubonic, plague, procopius, in, his, work, secret, history, declared, that, justinian, was, a, demon, of, an, emperor, who, either, created, the, plague, himself, or, was, being, punished, for, his, sinfulness, medieval, society, s, increasing, population, was, put, to, deadly, halt, when, in, the, late, middle, ages, europe, experienced, the, deadliest, disease, outbreak, in, history, they, called, it, the, great, dying, or, the, great, pestilence, later, coined, the, black, death, lasting, in, potency, for, roughly, six, years, 1346, 1352, the, black, death, claimed, one, third, of, the, european, human, population, with, mortality, rates, as, high, as, 70, 80, some, historians, believe, that, society, subsequently, became, more, violent, as, the, mass, mortality, rate, cheapened, life, and, thus, increased, warfare, crime, popular, revolt, waves, of, flagellants, and, persecution, the, black, death, originated, in, central, asia, and, spread, from, italy, and, then, throughout, other, european, countries, arab, historians, ibn, al, wardni, and, almaqrizi, believed, the, black, death, originated, in, mongolia, chinese, records, also, show, a, huge, outbreak, in, mongolia, in, the, early, 1330s, in, 2022, researchers, presented, evidence, that, the, plague, originated, near, lake, issyk, kul, in, kyrgyzstan, the, mongols, had, cut, the, trade, route, the, silk, road, between, china, and, europe, which, halted, the, spread, of, the, black, death, from, eastern, russia, to, western, europe, the, european, epidemic, may, have, begun, with, the, siege, of, caffa, an, attack, that, mongols, launched, on, the, italian, merchants, last, trading, station, in, the, region, caffa, in, the, crimea, in, late, 1346, plague, broke, out, among, the, besiegers, and, from, them, penetrated, the, town, the, mongol, forces, catapulted, plague, infested, corpses, into, caffa, as, a, form, of, attack, one, of, the, first, known, instances, of, biological, warfare, when, spring, arrived, the, italian, merchants, fled, on, their, ships, unknowingly, carrying, the, black, death, carried, by, the, fleas, on, rats, the, plague, initially, spread, to, humans, near, the, black, sea, and, then, outwards, to, the, rest, of, europe, as, a, result, of, people, fleeing, from, one, area, to, another, rats, migrated, with, humans, traveling, among, grain, bags, clothing, ships, wagons, and, grain, husks, continued, research, indicates, that, black, rats, those, that, primarily, transmitted, the, disease, prefer, grain, as, a, primary, meal, due, to, this, the, major, bulk, grain, fleets, that, transported, major, city, s, food, shipments, from, africa, and, alexandria, to, heavily, populated, areas, and, were, then, unloaded, by, hand, played, a, role, in, increasing, the, transmission, effectiveness, of, the, plague, the, plague, resurfaced, for, a, third, time, in, the, mid, 19th, century, this, is, also, known, as, the, modern, pandemic, like, the, two, previous, outbreaks, this, one, also, originated, in, eastern, asia, most, likely, in, yunnan, a, province, of, china, where, there, are, several, natural, plague, foci, the, initial, outbreaks, occurred, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, the, disease, remained, localized, in, southwest, china, for, several, years, before, spreading, in, the, city, of, canton, beginning, in, january, 1894, the, disease, had, killed, 80, 000, people, by, june, daily, water, traffic, with, the, nearby, city, of, hong, kong, rapidly, spread, the, plague, there, killing, over, 2, 400, within, two, months, during, the, 1894, hong, kong, plague, the, third, pandemic, spread, the, disease, to, port, cities, throughout, the, world, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, and, the, early, 20th, century, via, shipping, routes, the, plague, infected, people, in, chinatown, in, san, francisco, from, 1900, to, 1904, and, in, the, nearby, locales, of, oakland, and, the, east, bay, again, from, 1907, to, 1909, during, the, former, outbreak, in, 1902, authorities, made, permanent, the, chinese, exclusion, act, a, law, originally, signed, into, existence, by, president, chester, a, arthur, in, 1882, the, act, was, supposed, to, last, for, 10, years, but, was, renewed, in, 1892, with, the, geary, act, then, followed, by, the, 1902, decision, the, last, major, outbreak, in, the, united, states, occurred, in, los, angeles, in, 1924, though, the, disease, is, still, present, in, wild, rodents, and, can, be, passed, to, humans, who, come, in, contact, with, them, according, to, the, world, health, organization, the, pandemic, was, considered, active, until, 1959, when, worldwide, casualties, dropped, to, 200, per, year, in, 1994, a, plague, outbreak, in, five, indian, states, caused, an, estimated, 700, infections, including, 52, deaths, and, triggered, a, large, migration, of, indians, within, india, as, they, tried, to, avoid, the, disease, it, was, during, the, 1894, hong, kong, plague, outbreak, that, alexandre, yersin, isolated, the, bacterium, responsible, yersinia, pestis, a, few, days, after, japanese, bacteriologist, kitasato, shibasabur, had, isolated, it, however, the, latter, s, description, was, imprecise, and, also, expressed, doubts, of, its, relation, to, the, disease, and, thus, the, bacterium, is, today, only, named, after, yersin, the, scale, of, death, and, social, upheaval, associated, with, plague, outbreaks, has, made, the, topic, prominent, in, many, historical, and, fictional, accounts, since, the, disease, was, first, recognized, the, black, death, in, particular, is, described, and, referenced, in, numerous, contemporary, sources, some, of, which, including, works, by, chaucer, boccaccio, and, petrarch, are, considered, part, of, the, western, canon, the, decameron, by, boccaccio, is, notable, for, its, use, of, a, frame, story, involving, individuals, who, have, fled, florence, for, a, secluded, villa, to, escape, the, black, death, first, person, sometimes, sensationalized, or, fictionalized, accounts, of, living, through, plague, years, have, also, been, popular, across, centuries, and, cultures, for, example, samuel, pepys, s, diary, makes, several, references, to, his, first, hand, experiences, of, the, great, plague, of, london, in, 1665, 66, later, works, such, as, albert, camus, s, novel, the, plague, or, ingmar, bergman, s, film, the, seventh, seal, have, used, bubonic, plague, in, settings, such, as, quarantined, cities, in, either, medieval, or, modern, times, as, a, backdrop, to, explore, a, variety, of, concepts, common, themes, include, the, breakdown, of, society, institutions, and, individuals, during, the, plague, the, cultural, and, psychological, existential, confrontation, with, mortality, and, the, allegorical, use, of, the, plague, about, contemporary, moral, or, spiritual, questions, some, of, the, earliest, instances, of, biological, warfare, were, said, to, have, been, products, of, the, plague, as, armies, of, the, 14th, century, were, recorded, catapulting, diseased, corpses, over, the, walls, of, towns, and, villages, to, spread, the, pestilence, this, was, done, by, jani, beg, when, he, attacked, the, city, of, kaffa, in, 1343, later, plague, was, used, during, the, second, sino, japanese, war, as, a, bacteriological, weapon, by, the, imperial, japanese, army, these, weapons, were, provided, by, shir, ishii, s, units, and, used, in, experiments, on, humans, before, being, used, in, the, field, for, example, in, 1940, the, imperial, japanese, army, air, service, bombed, ningbo, with, fleas, carrying, the, bubonic, plague, during, the, khabarovsk, war, crime, trials, the, accused, such, as, major, general, kiyoshi, kawashima, testified, that, in, 1941, 40, members, of, unit, 731, air, dropped, plague, contaminated, fleas, on, changde, these, operations, caused, epidemic, plague, outbreaks, substantial, research, has, been, done, regarding, the, origin, of, the, plague, and, how, it, traveled, through, the, continent, mitochondrial, dna, of, modern, rats, in, western, europe, indicated, that, these, rats, came, from, two, different, areas, one, being, africa, and, the, other, unclear, the, research, regarding, this, pandemic, has, greatly, increased, with, technology, through, archaeo, molecular, investigation, researchers, have, discovered, the, dna, of, plague, bacillus, in, the, dental, core, of, those, that, fell, ill, to, the, plague, analysis, of, teeth, of, the, deceased, allows, researchers, to, further, understand, both, the, demographics, and, mortuary, patterns, of, the, disease, for, example, in, 2013, in, england, archeologists, uncovered, a, burial, mound, to, reveal, 17, bodies, mainly, children, who, had, died, of, the, bubonic, plague, they, analyzed, these, burial, remains, using, radiocarbon, dating, to, determine, they, were, from, the, 1530s, and, dental, core, analysis, revealed, the, presence, of, yersinia, pestis, other, evidence, for, rats, that, are, currently, still, being, researched, consists, of, gnaw, marks, on, bones, predator, pellets, and, rat, remains, that, were, preserved, in, situ, this, research, allows, individuals, to, trace, early, rat, remains, to, track, the, path, traveled, and, in, turn, connect, the, impact, of, the, bubonic, plague, to, specific, breeds, of, rats, burial, sites, known, as, plague, pits, offer, archaeologists, an, opportunity, to, study, the, remains, of, people, who, died, from, the, plague, another, research, study, indicates, that, these, separate, pandemics, were, all, interconnected, a, current, computer, model, indicates, that, the, disease, did, not, go, away, in, between, these, pandemics, it, rather, lurked, within, the, rat, population, for, years, without, causing, human, epidemics
