tuberculosis, tb, also, known, colloquially, as, the, white, death, or, historically, as, consumption, is, an, infectious, disease, usually, caused, by, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, mtb, bacteria, tuberculosis, generally, affects, the, lungs, but, it, can, also, affect, other, parts, of, the, body, most, infections, show, no, symptoms, in, which, case, it, is, known, as, latent, tuberculosis, around, 10, of, latent, infections, progress, to, active, disease, which, if, left, untreated, kill, about, half, of, those, affected, typical, symptoms, of, active, tb, are, chronic, cough, with, blood, containing, mucus, fever, night, sweats, and, weight, loss, infection, of, other, organs, can, cause, a, wide, range, of, symptoms, tuberculosis, is, spread, from, one, person, to, the, next, through, the, air, when, people, who, have, active, tb, in, their, lungs, cough, spit, speak, or, sneeze, people, with, latent, tb, do, not, spread, the, disease, active, infection, occurs, more, often, in, people, with, hiv, aids, and, in, those, who, smoke, diagnosis, of, active, tb, is, based, on, chest, x, rays, as, well, as, microscopic, examination, and, culture, of, body, fluids, diagnosis, of, latent, tb, relies, on, the, tuberculin, skin, test, tst, or, blood, tests, prevention, of, tb, involves, screening, those, at, high, risk, early, detection, and, treatment, of, cases, and, vaccination, with, the, bacillus, calmette, gu, rin, bcg, vaccine, those, at, high, risk, include, household, workplace, and, social, contacts, of, people, with, active, tb, treatment, requires, the, use, of, multiple, antibiotics, over, a, long, period, of, time, antibiotic, resistance, is, a, growing, problem, with, increasing, rates, of, multiple, drug, resistant, tuberculosis, mdr, tb, in, 2018, one, quarter, of, the, world, s, population, was, thought, to, have, a, latent, infection, of, tb, new, infections, occur, in, about, 1, of, the, population, each, year, in, 2022, an, estimated, 10, 6, million, people, developed, active, tb, resulting, in, 1, 3, million, deaths, making, it, the, second, leading, cause, of, death, from, an, infectious, disease, after, covid, 19, as, of, 2018, most, tb, cases, occurred, in, the, regions, of, south, east, asia, 44, africa, 24, and, the, western, pacific, 18, with, more, than, 50, of, cases, being, diagnosed, in, seven, countries, india, 27, china, 9, indonesia, 8, the, philippines, 6, pakistan, 6, nigeria, 4, and, bangladesh, 4, by, 2021, the, number, of, new, cases, each, year, was, decreasing, by, around, 2, annually, about, 80, of, people, in, many, asian, and, african, countries, test, positive, while, 5, 10, of, people, in, the, united, states, test, positive, via, the, tuberculin, test, tuberculosis, has, been, present, in, humans, since, ancient, times, tuberculosis, has, existed, since, antiquity, the, oldest, unambiguously, detected, m, tuberculosis, gives, evidence, of, the, disease, in, the, remains, of, bison, in, wyoming, dated, to, around, 17, 000, years, ago, however, whether, tuberculosis, originated, in, bovines, then, transferred, to, humans, or, whether, both, bovine, and, human, tuberculosis, diverged, from, a, common, ancestor, remains, unclear, a, comparison, of, the, genes, of, m, tuberculosis, complex, mtbc, in, humans, to, mtbc, in, animals, suggests, humans, did, not, acquire, mtbc, from, animals, during, animal, domestication, as, researchers, previously, believed, both, strains, of, the, tuberculosis, bacteria, share, a, common, ancestor, which, could, have, infected, humans, even, before, the, neolithic, revolution, skeletal, remains, show, some, prehistoric, humans, 4000, bc, had, tb, and, researchers, have, found, tubercular, decay, in, the, spines, of, egyptian, mummies, dating, from, 3000, to, 2400, bc, genetic, studies, suggest, the, presence, of, tb, in, the, americas, from, about, ad, 100, before, the, industrial, revolution, folklore, often, associated, tuberculosis, with, vampires, when, one, member, of, a, family, died, from, the, disease, the, other, infected, members, would, lose, their, health, slowly, people, believed, this, was, caused, by, the, original, person, with, tb, draining, the, life, from, the, other, family, members, although, richard, morton, established, the, pulmonary, form, associated, with, tubercles, as, a, pathology, in, 1689, due, to, the, variety, of, its, symptoms, tb, was, not, identified, as, a, single, disease, until, the, 1820s, benjamin, marten, conjectured, in, 1720, that, consumptions, were, caused, by, microbes, which, were, spread, by, people, living, close, to, each, other, in, 1819, ren, laennec, claimed, that, tubercles, were, the, cause, of, pulmonary, tuberculosis, j, l, sch, nlein, first, published, the, name, tuberculosis, german, tuberkulose, in, 1832, between, 1838, and, 1845, john, croghan, the, owner, of, mammoth, cave, in, kentucky, from, 1839, onwards, brought, a, number, of, people, with, tuberculosis, into, the, cave, in, the, hope, of, curing, the, disease, with, the, constant, temperature, and, purity, of, the, cave, air, each, died, within, a, year, hermann, brehmer, opened, the, first, tb, sanatorium, in, 1859, in, g, rbersdorf, now, soko, owsko, in, silesia, in, 1865, jean, antoine, villemin, demonstrated, that, tuberculosis, could, be, transmitted, via, inoculation, from, humans, to, animals, and, among, animals, villemin, s, findings, were, confirmed, in, 1867, and, 1868, by, john, burdon, sanderson, robert, koch, identified, and, described, the, bacillus, causing, tuberculosis, m, tuberculosis, on, 24, march, 1882, in, 1905, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, this, discovery, in, europe, rates, of, tuberculosis, began, to, rise, in, the, early, 1600s, to, a, peak, level, in, the, 1800s, when, it, caused, nearly, 25, of, all, deaths, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, century, tuberculosis, had, become, epidemic, in, europe, showing, a, seasonal, pattern, tuberculosis, caused, widespread, public, concern, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, as, the, disease, became, common, among, the, urban, poor, in, 1815, one, in, four, deaths, in, england, was, due, to, consumption, by, 1918, tb, still, caused, one, in, six, deaths, in, france, after, tb, was, determined, to, be, contagious, in, the, 1880s, it, was, put, on, a, notifiable, disease, list, in, britain, campaigns, started, to, stop, people, from, spitting, in, public, places, and, the, infected, poor, were, encouraged, to, enter, sanatoria, that, resembled, prisons, the, sanatoria, for, the, middle, and, upper, classes, offered, excellent, care, and, constant, medical, attention, what, later, became, known, as, the, alexandra, hospital, for, children, with, hip, disease, tuberculous, arthritis, was, opened, in, london, in, 1867, whatever, the, benefits, of, the, fresh, air, and, labor, in, the, sanatoria, even, under, the, best, conditions, 50, of, those, who, entered, died, within, five, years, c, 1916, robert, koch, did, not, believe, the, cattle, and, human, tuberculosis, diseases, were, similar, which, delayed, the, recognition, of, infected, milk, as, a, source, of, infection, during, the, first, half, of, the, 1900s, the, risk, of, transmission, from, this, source, was, dramatically, reduced, after, the, application, of, the, pasteurization, process, koch, announced, a, glycerine, extract, of, the, tubercle, bacilli, as, a, remedy, for, tuberculosis, in, 1890, calling, it, tuberculin, although, it, was, not, effective, it, was, later, successfully, adapted, as, a, screening, test, for, the, presence, of, pre, symptomatic, tuberculosis, world, tuberculosis, day, is, marked, on, 24, march, each, year, the, anniversary, of, koch, s, original, scientific, announcement, when, the, medical, research, council, formed, in, britain, in, 1913, it, initially, focused, on, tuberculosis, research, albert, calmette, and, camille, gu, rin, achieved, the, first, genuine, success, in, immunization, against, tuberculosis, in, 1906, using, attenuated, bovine, strain, tuberculosis, it, was, called, bacille, calmette, gu, rin, bcg, the, bcg, vaccine, was, first, used, on, humans, in, 1921, in, france, but, achieved, widespread, acceptance, in, the, us, great, britain, and, germany, only, after, world, war, ii, by, the, 1950s, mortality, in, europe, had, decreased, about, 90, improvements, in, sanitation, vaccination, and, other, public, health, measures, began, significantly, reducing, rates, of, tuberculosis, even, before, the, arrival, of, streptomycin, and, other, antibiotics, although, the, disease, remained, a, significant, threat, in, 1946, the, development, of, the, antibiotic, streptomycin, made, effective, treatment, and, cure, of, tb, a, reality, prior, to, the, introduction, of, this, medication, the, only, treatment, was, surgical, intervention, including, the, pneumothorax, technique, which, involved, collapsing, an, infected, lung, to, rest, it, and, to, allow, tuberculous, lesions, to, heal, because, of, the, emergence, of, multidrug, resistant, tuberculosis, mdr, tb, surgery, has, been, re, introduced, for, certain, cases, of, tb, infections, it, involves, the, removal, of, infected, chest, cavities, bullae, in, the, lungs, to, reduce, the, number, of, bacteria, and, to, increase, exposure, of, the, remaining, bacteria, to, antibiotics, in, the, bloodstream, hopes, of, eliminating, tb, ended, with, the, rise, of, drug, resistant, strains, in, the, 1980s, the, subsequent, resurgence, of, tuberculosis, resulted, in, the, declaration, of, a, global, health, emergency, by, the, world, health, organization, who, in, 1993, there, is, a, popular, misconception, that, tuberculosis, is, purely, a, disease, of, the, lungs, that, manifests, as, coughing, however, tuberculosis, may, infect, many, organs, even, though, it, most, commonly, occurs, in, the, lungs, known, as, pulmonary, tuberculosis, extrapulmonary, tb, occurs, when, tuberculosis, develops, outside, of, the, lungs, although, extrapulmonary, tb, may, coexist, with, pulmonary, tb, general, signs, and, symptoms, include, fever, chills, night, sweats, loss, of, appetite, weight, loss, and, fatigue, significant, nail, clubbing, may, also, occur, if, a, tuberculosis, infection, does, become, active, it, most, commonly, involves, the, lungs, in, about, 90, of, cases, symptoms, may, include, chest, pain, and, a, prolonged, cough, producing, sputum, about, 25, of, people, may, not, have, any, symptoms, i, e, they, remain, asymptomatic, occasionally, people, may, cough, up, blood, in, small, amounts, and, in, very, rare, cases, the, infection, may, erode, into, the, pulmonary, artery, or, a, rasmussen, aneurysm, resulting, in, massive, bleeding, tuberculosis, may, become, a, chronic, illness, and, cause, extensive, scarring, in, the, upper, lobes, of, the, lungs, the, upper, lung, lobes, are, more, frequently, affected, by, tuberculosis, than, the, lower, ones, the, reason, for, this, difference, is, not, clear, it, may, be, due, to, either, better, air, flow, or, poor, lymph, drainage, within, the, upper, lungs, in, 15, 20, of, active, cases, the, infection, spreads, outside, the, lungs, causing, other, kinds, of, tb, these, are, collectively, denoted, as, extrapulmonary, tuberculosis, extrapulmonary, tb, occurs, more, commonly, in, people, with, a, weakened, immune, system, and, young, children, in, those, with, hiv, this, occurs, in, more, than, 50, of, cases, notable, extrapulmonary, infection, sites, include, the, pleura, in, tuberculous, pleurisy, the, central, nervous, system, in, tuberculous, meningitis, the, lymphatic, system, in, scrofula, of, the, neck, the, genitourinary, system, in, urogenital, tuberculosis, and, the, bones, and, joints, in, pott, disease, of, the, spine, among, others, a, potentially, more, serious, widespread, form, of, tb, is, called, disseminated, tuberculosis, it, is, also, known, as, miliary, tuberculosis, miliary, tb, currently, makes, up, about, 10, of, extrapulmonary, cases, the, main, cause, of, tb, is, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, mtb, a, small, aerobic, nonmotile, bacillus, the, high, lipid, content, of, this, pathogen, accounts, for, many, of, its, unique, clinical, characteristics, it, divides, every, 16, to, 20, hours, which, is, an, extremely, slow, rate, compared, with, other, bacteria, which, usually, divide, in, less, than, an, hour, mycobacteria, have, an, outer, membrane, lipid, bilayer, if, a, gram, stain, is, performed, mtb, either, stains, very, weakly, gram, positive, or, does, not, retain, dye, as, a, result, of, the, high, lipid, and, mycolic, acid, content, of, its, cell, wall, mtb, can, withstand, weak, disinfectants, and, survive, in, a, dry, state, for, weeks, in, nature, the, bacterium, can, grow, only, within, the, cells, of, a, host, organism, but, m, tuberculosis, can, be, cultured, in, the, laboratory, using, histological, stains, on, expectorated, samples, from, phlegm, also, called, sputum, scientists, can, identify, mtb, under, a, microscope, since, mtb, retains, certain, stains, even, after, being, treated, with, acidic, solution, it, is, classified, as, an, acid, fast, bacillus, the, most, common, acid, fast, staining, techniques, are, the, ziehl, neelsen, stain, and, the, kinyoun, stain, which, dye, acid, fast, bacilli, a, bright, red, that, stands, out, against, a, blue, background, auramine, rhodamine, staining, and, fluorescence, microscopy, are, also, used, the, m, tuberculosis, complex, mtbc, includes, four, other, tb, causing, mycobacteria, m, bovis, m, africanum, m, canettii, and, m, microti, m, africanum, is, not, widespread, but, it, is, a, significant, cause, of, tuberculosis, in, parts, of, africa, m, bovis, was, once, a, common, cause, of, tuberculosis, but, the, introduction, of, pasteurized, milk, has, almost, eliminated, this, as, a, public, health, problem, in, developed, countries, m, canettii, is, rare, and, seems, to, be, limited, to, the, horn, of, africa, although, a, few, cases, have, been, seen, in, african, emigrants, m, microti, is, also, rare, and, is, seen, almost, only, in, immunodeficient, people, although, its, prevalence, may, be, significantly, underestimated, other, known, pathogenic, mycobacteria, include, m, leprae, m, avium, and, m, kansasii, the, latter, two, species, are, classified, as, nontuberculous, mycobacteria, ntm, or, atypical, mycobacteria, ntm, cause, neither, tb, nor, leprosy, but, they, do, cause, lung, diseases, that, resemble, tb, when, people, with, active, pulmonary, tb, cough, sneeze, speak, sing, or, spit, they, expel, infectious, aerosol, droplets, 0, 5, to, 5, 0, m, in, diameter, a, single, sneeze, can, release, up, to, 40, 000, droplets, each, one, of, these, droplets, may, transmit, the, disease, since, the, infectious, dose, of, tuberculosis, is, very, small, the, inhalation, of, fewer, than, 10, bacteria, may, cause, an, infection, people, with, prolonged, frequent, or, close, contact, with, people, with, tb, are, at, particularly, high, risk, of, becoming, infected, with, an, estimated, 22, infection, rate, a, person, with, active, but, untreated, tuberculosis, may, infect, 10, 15, or, more, other, people, per, year, transmission, should, occur, from, only, people, with, active, tb, those, with, latent, infection, are, not, thought, to, be, contagious, the, probability, of, transmission, from, one, person, to, another, depends, upon, several, factors, including, the, number, of, infectious, droplets, expelled, by, the, carrier, the, effectiveness, of, ventilation, the, duration, of, exposure, the, virulence, of, the, m, tuberculosis, strain, the, level, of, immunity, in, the, uninfected, person, and, others, the, cascade, of, person, to, person, spread, can, be, circumvented, by, segregating, those, with, active, overt, tb, and, putting, them, on, anti, tb, drug, regimens, after, about, two, weeks, of, effective, treatment, subjects, with, nonresistant, active, infections, generally, do, not, remain, contagious, to, others, if, someone, does, become, infected, it, typically, takes, three, to, four, weeks, before, the, newly, infected, person, becomes, infectious, enough, to, transmit, the, disease, to, others, a, number, of, factors, make, individuals, more, susceptible, to, tb, infection, and, or, disease, the, most, important, risk, factor, globally, for, developing, active, tb, is, concurrent, hiv, infection, 13, of, those, with, tb, are, also, infected, with, hiv, this, is, a, particular, problem, in, sub, saharan, africa, where, hiv, infection, rates, are, high, of, those, without, hiv, infection, who, are, infected, with, tuberculosis, about, 5, 10, develop, active, disease, during, their, lifetimes, in, contrast, 30, of, those, co, infected, with, hiv, develop, the, active, disease, use, of, certain, medications, such, as, corticosteroids, and, infliximab, an, anti, tnf, monoclonal, antibody, is, another, important, risk, factor, especially, in, the, developed, world, other, risk, factors, include, alcoholism, diabetes, mellitus, 3, fold, increased, risk, silicosis, 30, fold, increased, risk, tobacco, smoking, 2, fold, increased, risk, indoor, air, pollution, malnutrition, young, age, recently, acquired, tb, infection, recreational, drug, use, severe, kidney, disease, low, body, weight, organ, transplant, head, and, neck, cancer, and, genetic, susceptibility, the, overall, importance, of, genetic, risk, factors, remains, undefined, tobacco, smoking, increases, the, risk, of, infections, in, addition, to, increasing, the, risk, of, active, disease, and, death, additional, factors, increasing, infection, susceptibility, include, young, age, about, 90, of, those, infected, with, m, tuberculosis, have, asymptomatic, latent, tb, infections, sometimes, called, ltbi, with, only, a, 10, lifetime, chance, that, the, latent, infection, will, progress, to, overt, active, tuberculous, disease, in, those, with, hiv, the, risk, of, developing, active, tb, increases, to, nearly, 10, a, year, if, effective, treatment, is, not, given, the, death, rate, for, active, tb, cases, is, up, to, 66, tb, infection, begins, when, the, mycobacteria, reach, the, alveolar, air, sacs, of, the, lungs, where, they, invade, and, replicate, within, endosomes, of, alveolar, macrophages, macrophages, identify, the, bacterium, as, foreign, and, attempt, to, eliminate, it, by, phagocytosis, during, this, process, the, bacterium, is, enveloped, by, the, macrophage, and, stored, temporarily, in, a, membrane, bound, vesicle, called, a, phagosome, the, phagosome, then, combines, with, a, lysosome, to, create, a, phagolysosome, in, the, phagolysosome, the, cell, attempts, to, use, reactive, oxygen, species, and, acid, to, kill, the, bacterium, however, m, tuberculosis, has, a, thick, waxy, mycolic, acid, capsule, that, protects, it, from, these, toxic, substances, m, tuberculosis, is, able, to, reproduce, inside, the, macrophage, and, will, eventually, kill, the, immune, cell, the, primary, site, of, infection, in, the, lungs, known, as, the, ghon, focus, is, generally, located, in, either, the, upper, part, of, the, lower, lobe, or, the, lower, part, of, the, upper, lobe, tuberculosis, of, the, lungs, may, also, occur, via, infection, from, the, blood, stream, this, is, known, as, a, simon, focus, and, is, typically, found, in, the, top, of, the, lung, this, hematogenous, transmission, can, also, spread, infection, to, more, distant, sites, such, as, peripheral, lymph, nodes, the, kidneys, the, brain, and, the, bones, all, parts, of, the, body, can, be, affected, by, the, disease, though, for, unknown, reasons, it, rarely, affects, the, heart, skeletal, muscles, pancreas, or, thyroid, tuberculosis, is, classified, as, one, of, the, granulomatous, inflammatory, diseases, macrophages, epithelioid, cells, t, lymphocytes, b, lymphocytes, and, fibroblasts, aggregate, to, form, granulomas, with, lymphocytes, surrounding, the, infected, macrophages, when, other, macrophages, attack, the, infected, macrophage, they, fuse, together, to, form, a, giant, multinucleated, cell, in, the, alveolar, lumen, the, granuloma, may, prevent, dissemination, of, the, mycobacteria, and, provide, a, local, environment, for, interaction, of, cells, of, the, immune, system, however, more, recent, evidence, suggests, that, the, bacteria, use, the, granulomas, to, avoid, destruction, by, the, host, s, immune, system, macrophages, and, dendritic, cells, in, the, granulomas, are, unable, to, present, antigen, to, lymphocytes, thus, the, immune, response, is, suppressed, bacteria, inside, the, granuloma, can, become, dormant, resulting, in, latent, infection, another, feature, of, the, granulomas, is, the, development, of, abnormal, cell, death, necrosis, in, the, center, of, tubercles, to, the, naked, eye, this, has, the, texture, of, soft, white, cheese, and, is, termed, caseous, necrosis, if, tb, bacteria, gain, entry, to, the, blood, stream, from, an, area, of, damaged, tissue, they, can, spread, throughout, the, body, and, set, up, many, foci, of, infection, all, appearing, as, tiny, white, tubercles, in, the, tissues, this, severe, form, of, tb, disease, most, common, in, young, children, and, those, with, hiv, is, called, miliary, tuberculosis, people, with, this, disseminated, tb, have, a, high, fatality, rate, even, with, treatment, about, 30, in, many, people, the, infection, waxes, and, wanes, tissue, destruction, and, necrosis, are, often, balanced, by, healing, and, fibrosis, affected, tissue, is, replaced, by, scarring, and, cavities, filled, with, caseous, necrotic, material, during, active, disease, some, of, these, cavities, are, joined, to, the, air, passages, bronchi, and, this, material, can, be, coughed, up, it, contains, living, bacteria, and, thus, can, spread, the, infection, treatment, with, appropriate, antibiotics, kills, bacteria, and, allows, healing, to, take, place, upon, cure, affected, areas, are, eventually, replaced, by, scar, tissue, diagnosing, active, tuberculosis, based, only, on, signs, and, symptoms, is, difficult, as, is, diagnosing, the, disease, in, those, who, have, a, weakened, immune, system, a, diagnosis, of, tb, should, however, be, considered, in, those, with, signs, of, lung, disease, or, constitutional, symptoms, lasting, longer, than, two, weeks, a, chest, x, ray, and, multiple, sputum, cultures, for, acid, fast, bacilli, are, typically, part, of, the, initial, evaluation, interferon, release, assays, igra, and, tuberculin, skin, tests, are, of, little, use, in, most, of, the, developing, world, igra, have, similar, limitations, in, those, with, hiv, a, definitive, diagnosis, of, tb, is, made, by, identifying, m, tuberculosis, in, a, clinical, sample, e, g, sputum, pus, or, a, tissue, biopsy, however, the, difficult, culture, process, for, this, slow, growing, organism, can, take, two, to, six, weeks, for, blood, or, sputum, culture, thus, treatment, is, often, begun, before, cultures, are, confirmed, nucleic, acid, amplification, tests, and, adenosine, deaminase, testing, may, allow, rapid, diagnosis, of, tb, blood, tests, to, detect, antibodies, are, not, specific, or, sensitive, so, they, are, not, recommended, the, mantoux, tuberculin, skin, test, is, often, used, to, screen, people, at, high, risk, for, tb, those, who, have, been, previously, immunized, with, the, bacille, calmette, guerin, vaccine, may, have, a, false, positive, test, result, the, test, may, be, falsely, negative, in, those, with, sarcoidosis, hodgkin, s, lymphoma, malnutrition, and, most, notably, active, tuberculosis, interferon, gamma, release, assays, on, a, blood, sample, are, recommended, in, those, who, are, positive, to, the, mantoux, test, these, are, not, affected, by, immunization, or, most, environmental, mycobacteria, so, they, generate, fewer, false, positive, results, however, they, are, affected, by, m, szulgai, m, marinum, and, m, kansasii, igras, may, increase, sensitivity, when, used, in, addition, to, the, skin, test, but, may, be, less, sensitive, than, the, skin, test, when, used, alone, the, us, preventive, services, task, force, uspstf, has, recommended, screening, people, who, are, at, high, risk, for, latent, tuberculosis, with, either, tuberculin, skin, tests, or, interferon, gamma, release, assays, while, some, have, recommend, testing, health, care, workers, evidence, of, benefit, for, this, is, poor, as, of, 2019, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, stopped, recommending, yearly, testing, of, health, care, workers, without, known, exposure, in, 2019, tuberculosis, prevention, and, control, efforts, rely, primarily, on, the, vaccination, of, infants, and, the, detection, and, appropriate, treatment, of, active, cases, the, world, health, organization, who, has, achieved, some, success, with, improved, treatment, regimens, and, a, small, decrease, in, case, numbers, some, countries, have, legislation, to, involuntarily, detain, or, examine, those, suspected, to, have, tuberculosis, or, involuntarily, treat, them, if, infected, the, only, available, vaccine, as, of, 2021, is, bacillus, calmette, gu, rin, bcg, in, children, it, decreases, the, risk, of, getting, the, infection, by, 20, and, the, risk, of, infection, turning, into, active, disease, by, nearly, 60, it, is, the, most, widely, used, vaccine, worldwide, with, more, than, 90, of, all, children, being, vaccinated, the, immunity, it, induces, decreases, after, about, ten, years, as, tuberculosis, is, uncommon, in, most, of, canada, western, europe, and, the, united, states, bcg, is, administered, to, only, those, people, at, high, risk, part, of, the, reasoning, against, the, use, of, the, vaccine, is, that, it, makes, the, tuberculin, skin, test, falsely, positive, reducing, the, test, s, usefulness, as, a, screening, tool, several, vaccines, are, being, developed, intradermal, mva85a, vaccine, in, addition, to, bcg, injection, is, not, effective, in, preventing, tuberculosis, public, health, campaigns, which, have, focused, on, overcrowding, public, spitting, and, regular, sanitation, including, hand, washing, during, the, 1800s, helped, to, either, interrupt, or, slow, spread, which, when, combined, with, contact, tracing, isolation, and, treatment, helped, to, dramatically, curb, the, transmission, of, both, tuberculosis, and, other, airborne, diseases, which, led, to, the, elimination, of, tuberculosis, as, a, major, public, health, issue, in, most, developed, economies, other, risk, factors, which, worsened, tb, spread, such, as, malnutrition, were, also, ameliorated, but, since, the, emergence, of, hiv, a, new, population, of, immunocompromised, individuals, was, available, for, tb, to, infect, during, the, hiv, aids, epidemic, in, the, us, up, to, 35, of, those, affected, by, tb, were, also, infected, by, hiv, handling, of, tb, infected, patients, in, us, hospitals, was, known, to, create, airborne, tb, that, could, infect, others, especially, in, unventilated, spaces, multiple, us, agencies, rolled, out, new, public, health, rules, as, a, result, of, the, tb, spread, the, cdc, brought, in, new, guidelines, mandating, hepa, filters, and, hepa, respirators, niosh, pushed, through, new, 42, cfr, 84, respirator, regulations, in, 1995, like, the, n95, and, osha, created, a, proposed, rule, for, tb, in, 1997, a, result, of, pressure, from, groups, like, the, labor, coalition, to, fight, tb, in, the, workplace, however, in, 2003, osha, dropped, their, proposed, tb, rules, citing, a, decline, of, tb, in, the, us, and, public, disapproval, the, world, health, organization, who, declared, tb, a, global, health, emergency, in, 1993, and, in, 2006, the, stop, tb, partnership, developed, a, global, plan, to, stop, tuberculosis, that, aimed, to, save, 14, million, lives, between, its, launch, and, 2015, a, number, of, targets, they, set, were, not, achieved, by, 2015, mostly, due, to, the, increase, in, hiv, associated, tuberculosis, and, the, emergence, of, multiple, drug, resistant, tuberculosis, a, tuberculosis, classification, system, developed, by, the, american, thoracic, society, is, used, primarily, in, public, health, programs, in, 2015, it, launched, the, end, tb, strategy, to, reduce, deaths, by, 95, and, incidence, by, 90, before, 2035, the, goal, of, tuberculosis, elimination, is, being, hampered, by, the, lack, of, rapid, testing, short, and, effective, treatment, courses, and, completely, effective, vaccines, the, benefits, and, risks, of, giving, anti, tubercular, drugs, to, those, exposed, to, mdr, tb, is, unclear, making, haart, therapy, available, to, hiv, positive, individuals, significantly, reduces, the, risk, of, progression, to, an, active, tb, infection, by, up, to, 90, and, can, mitigate, the, spread, through, this, population, treatment, of, tb, uses, antibiotics, to, kill, the, bacteria, effective, tb, treatment, is, difficult, due, to, the, unusual, structure, and, chemical, composition, of, the, mycobacterial, cell, wall, which, hinders, the, entry, of, drugs, and, makes, many, antibiotics, ineffective, active, tb, is, best, treated, with, combinations, of, several, antibiotics, to, reduce, the, risk, of, the, bacteria, developing, antibiotic, resistance, the, routine, use, of, rifabutin, instead, of, rifampicin, in, hiv, positive, people, with, tuberculosis, is, of, unclear, benefit, as, of, 2007, acetylsalicylic, acid, aspirin, at, a, dose, of, 100, mg, per, day, has, been, shown, to, improve, clinical, signs, and, symptoms, reduce, cavitary, lesions, lower, inflammatory, markers, and, increase, the, rate, of, sputum, negative, conversion, in, patients, with, pulmonary, tuberculosis, latent, tb, is, treated, with, either, isoniazid, or, rifampin, alone, or, a, combination, of, isoniazid, with, either, rifampicin, or, rifapentine, the, treatment, takes,

education, or, counselling, may, improve, the, latent, tuberculosis, treatment, completion, rates, the, recommended, treatment, of, new, onset, pulmonary, tuberculosis, as, of, 2010, is, six, months, of, a, combination, of, antibiotics, containing, rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and, ethambutol, for, the, first, two, months, and, only, rifampicin, and, isoniazid, for, the, last, four, months, where, resistance, to, isoniazid, is, high, ethambutol, may, be, added, for, the, last, four, months, as, an, alternative, treatment, with, anti, tb, drugs, for, at, least, 6, months, results, in, higher, success, rates, when, compared, with, treatment, less, than, 6, months, even, though, the, difference, is, small, shorter, treatment, regimen, may, be, recommended, for, those, with, compliance, issues, there, is, also, no, evidence, to, support, shorter, anti, tuberculosis, treatment, regimens, when, compared, to, a, 6, month, treatment, regimen, however, results, presented, in, 2020, from, an, international, randomized, controlled, clinical, trial, indicate, that, a, four, month, daily, treatment, regimen, containing, high, dose, or, optimized, rifapentine, with, moxifloxacin, 2phzm, 2phm, is, as, safe, and, effective, as, the, existing, standard, six, month, daily, regimen, at, curing, drug, susceptible, tuberculosis, tb, disease, if, tuberculosis, recurs, testing, to, determine, which, antibiotics, it, is, sensitive, to, is, important, before, determining, treatment, if, multiple, drug, resistant, tb, mdr, tb, is, detected, treatment, with, at, least, four, effective, antibiotics, for, 18, to, 24, months, is, recommended, directly, observed, therapy, i, e, having, a, health, care, provider, watch, the, person, take, their, medications, is, recommended, by, the, world, health, organization, who, in, an, effort, to, reduce, the, number, of, people, not, appropriately, taking, antibiotics, the, evidence, to, support, this, practice, over, people, simply, taking, their, medications, independently, is, of, poor, quality, there, is, no, strong, evidence, indicating, that, directly, observed, therapy, improves, the, number, of, people, who, were, cured, or, the, number, of, people, who, complete, their, medicine, moderate, quality, evidence, suggests, that, there, is, also, no, difference, if, people, are, observed, at, home, versus, at, a, clinic, or, by, a, family, member, versus, a, health, care, worker, methods, to, remind, people, of, the, importance, of, treatment, and, appointments, may, result, in, a, small, but, important, improvement, there, is, also, not, enough, evidence, to, support, intermittent, rifampicin, containing, therapy, given, two, to, three, times, a, week, has, equal, effectiveness, as, daily,

a, person, with, fully, susceptible, mtb, may, develop, secondary, acquired, resistance, during, therapy, because, of, inadequate, treatment, not, taking, the, prescribed, regimen, appropriately, lack, of, compliance, or, using, low, quality, medication, drug, resistant, tb, is, a, serious, public, health, issue, in, many, developing, countries, as, its, treatment, is, longer, and, requires, more, expensive, drugs, mdr, tb, is, defined, as, resistance, to, the, two, most, effective, first, line, tb, drugs, rifampicin, and, isoniazid, extensively, drug, resistant, tb, is, also, resistant, to, three, or, more, of, the, six, classes, of, second, line, drugs, totally, drug, resistant, tb, is, resistant, to, all, currently, used, drugs, it, was, first, observed, in, 2003, in, italy, but, not, widely, reported, until, 2012, and, has, also, been, found, in, iran, and, india, there, is, some, efficacy, for, linezolid, to, treat, those, with, xdr, tb, but, side, effects, and, discontinuation, of, medications, were, common, bedaquiline, is, tentatively, supported, for, use, in, multiple, drug, resistant, tb, xdr, tb, is, a, term, sometimes, used, to, define, extensively, resistant, tb, and, constitutes, one, in, ten, cases, of, mdr, tb, cases, of, xdr, tb, have, been, identified, in, more, than, 90, of, countries, for, those, with, known, rifampicin, or, mdr, tb, molecular, tests, such, as, the, genotype, mtbdrsl, assay, performed, on, culture, isolates, or, smear, positive, specimens, may, be, useful, to, detect, second, line, anti, tubercular, drug, resistance, progression, from, tb, infection, to, overt, tb, disease, occurs, when, the, bacilli, overcome, the, immune, system, defenses, and, begin, to, multiply, in, primary, tb, disease, some, 1, 5, of, cases, this, occurs, soon, after, the, initial, infection, however, in, the, majority, of, cases, a, latent, infection, occurs, with, no, obvious, symptoms, these, dormant, bacilli, produce, active, tuberculosis, in, 5, 10, of, these, latent, cases, often, many, years, after, infection, the, risk, of, reactivation, increases, with, immunosuppression, such, as, that, caused, by, infection, with, hiv, in, people, coinfected, with, m, tuberculosis, and, hiv, the, risk, of, reactivation, increases, to, 10, per, year, studies, using, dna, fingerprinting, of, m, tuberculosis, strains, have, shown, reinfection, contributes, more, substantially, to, recurrent, tb, than, previously, thought, with, estimates, that, it, might, account, for, more, than, 50, of, reactivated, cases, in, areas, where, tb, is, common, the, chance, of, death, from, a, case, of, tuberculosis, is, about, 4, as, of, 2008, down, from, 8, in, 1995, in, people, with, smear, positive, pulmonary, tb, without, hiv, co, infection, after, 5, years, without, treatment, 50, 60, die, while, 20, 25, achieve, spontaneous, resolution, cure, tb, is, almost, always, fatal, in, those, with, untreated, hiv, co, infection, and, death, rates, are, increased, even, with, antiretroviral, treatment, of, hiv, roughly, one, quarter, of, the, world, s, population, has, been, infected, with, m, tuberculosis, with, new, infections, occurring, in, about, 1, of, the, population, each, year, however, most, infections, with, m, tuberculosis, do, not, cause, disease, and, 90, 95, of, infections, remain, asymptomatic, in, 2012, an, estimated, 8, 6, million, chronic, cases, were, active, in, 2010, 8, 8, million, new, cases, of, tuberculosis, were, diagnosed, and, 1, 20, 1, 45, million, deaths, occurred, most, of, these, occurring, in, developing, countries, of, these, about, 0, 35, million, occur, in, those, also, infected, with, hiv, in, 2018, tuberculosis, was, the, leading, cause, of, death, worldwide, from, a, single, infectious, agent, the, total, number, of, tuberculosis, cases, has, been, decreasing, since, 2005, while, new, cases, have, decreased, since, 2002, tuberculosis, incidence, is, seasonal, with, peaks, occurring, every, spring, and, summer, the, reasons, for, this, are, unclear, but, may, be, related, to, vitamin, d, deficiency, during, the, winter, there, are, also, studies, linking, tuberculosis, to, different, weather, conditions, like, low, temperature, low, humidity, and, low, rainfall, it, has, been, suggested, that, tuberculosis, incidence, rates, may, be, connected, to, climate, change, tuberculosis, is, closely, linked, to, both, overcrowding, and, malnutrition, making, it, one, of, the, principal, diseases, of, poverty, those, at, high, risk, thus, include, people, who, inject, illicit, drugs, inhabitants, and, employees, of, locales, where, vulnerable, people, gather, e, g, prisons, and, homeless, shelters, medically, underprivileged, and, resource, poor, communities, high, risk, ethnic, minorities, children, in, close, contact, with, high, risk, category, patients, and, health, care, providers, serving, these, patients, the, rate, of, tuberculosis, varies, with, age, in, africa, it, primarily, affects, adolescents, and, young, adults, however, in, countries, where, incidence, rates, have, declined, dramatically, such, as, the, united, states, tuberculosis, is, mainly, a, disease, of, the, elderly, and, immunocompromised, risk, factors, are, listed, above, worldwide, 22, high, burden, states, or, countries, together, experience, 80, of, cases, as, well, as, 83, of, deaths, in, canada, and, australia, tuberculosis, is, many, times, more, common, among, the, indigenous, peoples, especially, in, remote, areas, factors, contributing, to, this, include, higher, prevalence, of, predisposing, health, conditions, and, behaviours, and, overcrowding, and, poverty, in, some, canadian, indigenous, groups, genetic, susceptibility, may, play, a, role, socioeconomic, status, ses, strongly, affects, tb, risk, people, of, low, ses, are, both, more, likely, to, contract, tb, and, to, be, more, severely, affected, by, the, disease, those, with, low, ses, are, more, likely, to, be, affected, by, risk, factors, for, developing, tb, e, g, malnutrition, indoor, air, pollution, hiv, co, infection, etc, and, are, additionally, more, likely, to, be, exposed, to, crowded, and, poorly, ventilated, spaces, inadequate, healthcare, also, means, that, people, with, active, disease, who, facilitate, spread, are, not, diagnosed, and, treated, promptly, sick, people, thus, remain, in, the, infectious, state, and, continue, to, spread, the, infection, the, distribution, of, tuberculosis, is, not, uniform, across, the, globe, about, 80, of, the, population, in, many, african, caribbean, south, asian, and, eastern, european, countries, test, positive, in, tuberculin, tests, while, only, 5, 10, of, the, u, s, population, test, positive, hopes, of, totally, controlling, the, disease, have, been, dramatically, dampened, because, of, many, factors, including, the, difficulty, of, developing, an, effective, vaccine, the, expensive, and, time, consuming, diagnostic, process, the, necessity, of, many, months, of, treatment, the, increase, in, hiv, associated, tuberculosis, and, the, emergence, of, drug, resistant, cases, in, the, 1980s, in, developed, countries, tuberculosis, is, less, common, and, is, found, mainly, in, urban, areas, in, europe, deaths, from, tb, fell, from, 500, out, of, 100, 000, in, 1850, to, 50, out, of, 100, 000, by, 1950, improvements, in, public, health, were, reducing, tuberculosis, even, before, the, arrival, of, antibiotics, although, the, disease, remained, a, significant, threat, to, public, health, such, that, when, the, medical, research, council, was, formed, in, britain, in, 1913, its, initial, focus, was, tuberculosis, research, in, 2010, rates, per, 100, 000, people, in, different,

between, 1990, and, 2010, the, number, of, new, cases, has, declined, by, 17, between, 2004, and, 2014, in, 2007, the, country, with, the, highest, estimated, incidence, rate, of, tb, was, eswatini, with, 1, 200, cases, per, 100, 000, people, in, 2017, the, country, with, the, highest, estimated, incidence, rate, as, a, of, the, population, was, lesotho, with, 665, cases, per, 100, 000, people, in, south, africa, 54, 200, people, died, in, 2022, from, tb, the, incidence, rate, was, 468, per, 100, 000, people, in, 2015, this, was, 988, per, 100, 000, the, total, incidence, was, 280, 000, in, 2022, in, 2015, this, was, 552, 000, as, of, 2017, india, had, the, largest, total, incidence, with, an, estimated, 2, 740, 000, cases, according, to, the, world, health, organization, who, in, 2000, 2015, india, s, estimated, mortality, rate, dropped, from, 55, to, 36, per, 100, 000, population, per, year, with, estimated, 480, thousand, people, died, of, tb, in, 2015, in, india, a, major, proportion, of, tuberculosis, patients, are, being, treated, by, private, partners, and, private, hospitals, evidence, indicates, that, the, tuberculosis, national, survey, does, not, represent, the, number, of, cases, that, are, diagnosed, and, recorded, by, private, clinics, and, hospitals, in, india, in, the, united, states, native, americans, have, a, fivefold, greater, mortality, from, tb, and, racial, and, ethnic, minorities, accounted, for, 84, of, all, reported, tb, cases, the, overall, tuberculosis, case, rate, in, the, united, states, was, 3, per, 100, 000, persons, in, 2017, in, 2024, long, beach, california, authorized, a, public, health, emergency, in, response, to, a, local, outbreak, of, tb, in, canada, tuberculosis, was, endemic, in, some, rural, areas, as, of, 1998, in, 2017, in, the, united, kingdom, the, national, average, was, 9, per, 100, 000, and, the, highest, incidence, rates, in, western, europe, were, 20, per, 100, 000, in, portugal, tuberculosis, has, been, known, by, many, names, from, the, technical, to, the, familiar, phthisis, is, the, greek, word, for, consumption, an, old, term, for, pulmonary, tuberculosis, around, 460, bce, hippocrates, described, phthisis, as, a, disease, of, dry, seasons, the, abbreviation, tb, is, short, for, tubercle, bacillus, consumption, was, the, most, common, nineteenth, century, english, word, for, the, disease, and, was, also, in, use, well, into, the, twentieth, century, the, latin, root, con, meaning, completely, is, linked, to, sumere, meaning, to, take, up, from, under, in, the, life, and, death, of, mr, badman, by, john, bunyan, the, author, calls, consumption, the, captain, of, all, these, men, of, death, great, white, plague, has, also, been, used, tuberculosis, was, for, centuries, associated, with, poetic, and, artistic, qualities, among, those, infected, and, was, also, known, as, the, romantic, disease, major, artistic, figures, such, as, the, poets, john, keats, percy, bysshe, shelley, and, edgar, allan, poe, the, composer, fr, d, ric, chopin, the, playwright, anton, chekhov, the, novelists, franz, kafka, katherine, mansfield, charlotte, bront, fyodor, dostoevsky,

mechanisms, proposed, for, this, effect, included, the, slight, fever, and, toxaemia, that, it, caused, allegedly, helping, them, to, see, life, more, clearly, and, to, act, decisively, tuberculosis, formed, an, often, reused, theme, in, literature, as, in, thomas, mann, s, the, magic, mountain, set, in, a, sanatorium, in, music, as, in, van, morrison, s, song, t, b, sheets, in, opera, as, in, puccini, s, la, boh, me, and, verdi, s, la, traviata, in, art, as, in, munch, s, painting, of, his, ill, sister, and, in, film, such, as, the, 1945, the, bells, of, st, mary, s, starring, ingrid, bergman, as, a, nun, with, tuberculosis, in, 2014, the, who, adopted, the, end, tb, strategy, which, aims, to, reduce, tb, incidence, by, 80, and, tb, deaths, by, 90, by, 2030, the, strategy, contains, a, milestone, to, reduce, tb, incidence, by, 20, and, tb, deaths, by, 35, by, 2020, however, by, 2020, only, a, 9, reduction, in, incidence, per, population, was, achieved, globally, with, the, european, region, achieving, 19, and, the, african, region, achieving, 16, reductions, similarly, the, number, of, deaths, only, fell, by, 14, missing, the, 2020, milestone, of, a, 35, reduction, with, some, regions, making, better, progress, 31, reduction, in, europe, and, 19, in, africa, correspondingly, also, treatment, prevention, and, funding, milestones, were, missed, in, 2020, for, example, only, 6, 3, million, people, were, started, on, tb, prevention, short, of, the, target, of, 30, million, the, world, health, organization, who, the, bill, and, melinda, gates, foundation, and, the, u, s, government, are, subsidizing, a, fast, acting, diagnostic, tuberculosis, test, for, use, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, as, of, 2012, in, addition, to, being, fast, acting, the, test, can, determine, if, there, is, resistance, to, the, antibiotic, rifampicin, which, may, indicate, multi, drug, resistant, tuberculosis, and, is, accurate, in, those, who, are, also, infected, with, hiv, many, resource, poor, places, as, of, 2011, have, access, to, only, sputum, microscopy, india, had, the, highest, total, number, of, tb, cases, worldwide, in, 2010, in, part, due, to, poor, disease, management, within, the, private, and, public, health, care, sector, programs, such, as, the, revised, national, tuberculosis, control, program, are, working, to, reduce, tb, levels, among, people, receiving, public, health, care, a, 2014, eiu, healthcare, report, finds, there, is, a, need, to, address, apathy, and, urges, for, increased, funding, the, report, cites, among, others, lucica, ditui, is, like, an, orphan, it, has, been, neglected, even, in, countries, with, a, high, burden, and, often, forgotten, by, donors, and, those, investing, in, health, interventions, slow, progress, has, led, to, frustration, expressed, by, the, executive, director, of, the, global, fund, to, fight, aids, tuberculosis, and, malaria, mark, dybul, we, have, the, tools, to, end, tb, as, a, pandemic, and, public, health, threat, on, the, planet, but, we, are, not, doing, it, several, international, organizations, are, pushing, for, more, transparency, in, treatment, and, more, countries, are, implementing, mandatory, reporting, of, cases, to, the, government, as, of, 2014, although, adherence, is, often, variable, commercial, treatment, providers, may, at, times, overprescribe, second, line, drugs, as, well, as, supplementary, treatment, promoting, demands, for, further, regulations, the, government, of, brazil, provides, universal, tb, care, which, reduces, this, problem, conversely, falling, rates, of, tb, infection, may, not, relate, to, the, number, of, programs, directed, at, reducing, infection, rates, but, may, be, tied, to, an, increased, level, of, education, income, and, health, of, the, population, costs, of, the, disease, as, calculated, by, the, world, bank, in, 2009, may, exceed, us, 150, billion, per, year, in, high, burden, countries, lack, of, progress, eradicating, the, disease, may, also, be, due, to, lack, of, patient, follow, up, as, among, the, 250, million, rural, migrants, in, china, there, is, insufficient, data, to, show, that, active, contact, tracing, helps, to, improve, case, detection, rates, for, tuberculosis, interventions, such, as, house, to, house, visits, educational, leaflets, mass, media, strategies, educational, sessions, may, increase, tuberculosis, detection, rates, in, short, term, there, is, no, study, that, compares, new, methods, of, contact, tracing, such, as, social, network, analysis, with, existing, contact, tracing, methods, slow, progress, in, preventing, the, disease, may, in, part, be, due, to, stigma, associated, with, tb, stigma, may, be, due, to, the, fear, of, transmission, from, affected, individuals, this, stigma, may, additionally, arise, due, to, links, between, tb, and, poverty, and, in, africa, aids, such, stigmatization, may, be, both, real, and, perceived, for, example, in, ghana, individuals, with, tb, are, banned, from, attending, public, gatherings, stigma, towards, tb, may, result, in, delays, in, seeking, treatment, lower, treatment, compliance, and, family, members, keeping, cause, of, death, secret, allowing, the, disease, to, spread, further, in, contrast, in, russia, stigma, was, associated, with, increased, treatment, compliance, tb, stigma, also, affects, socially, marginalized, individuals, to, a, greater, degree, and, varies, between, regions, one, way, to, decrease, stigma, may, be, through, the, promotion, of, tb, clubs, where, those, infected, may, share, experiences, and, offer, support, or, through, counseling, some, studies, have, shown, tb, education, programs, to, be, effective, in, decreasing, stigma, and, may, thus, be, effective, in, increasing, treatment, adherence, despite, this, studies, on, the, relationship, between, reduced, stigma, and, mortality, are, lacking, as, of, 2010, and, similar, efforts, to, decrease, stigma, surrounding, aids, have, been, minimally, effective, some, have, claimed, the, stigma, to, be, worse, than, the, disease, and, healthcare, providers, may, unintentionally, reinforce, stigma, as, those, with, tb, are, often, perceived, as, difficult, or, otherwise, undesirable, a, greater, understanding, of, the, social, and, cultural, dimensions, of, tuberculosis, may, also, help, with, stigma, reduction, the, bcg, vaccine, has, limitations, and, research, to, develop, new, tb, vaccines, is, ongoing, a, number, of, potential, candidates, are, currently, in, phase, i, and, ii, clinical, trials, two, main, approaches, are, used, to, attempt, to, improve, the, efficacy, of, available, vaccines, one, approach, involves, adding, a, subunit, vaccine, to, bcg, while, the, other, strategy, is, attempting, to, create, new, and, better, live, vaccines, mva85a, an, example, of, a, subunit, vaccine, is, in, trials, in, south, africa, as, of, 2006, is, based, on, a, genetically, modified, vaccinia, virus, vaccines, are, hoped, to, play, a, significant, role, in, treatment, of, both, latent, and, active, disease, to, encourage, further, discovery, researchers, and, policymakers, are, promoting, new, economic, models, of, vaccine, development, as, of, 2006, including, prizes, tax, incentives, and, advance, market, commitments, a, number, of, groups, including, the, stop, tb, partnership, the, south, african, tuberculosis, vaccine, initiative, and, the, aeras, global, tb, vaccine, foundation, are, involved, with, research, among, these, the, aeras, global, tb, vaccine, foundation, received, a, gift, of, more, than, 280, million, us, from, the, bill, and, melinda, gates, foundation, to, develop, and, license, an, improved, vaccine, against, tuberculosis, for, use, in, high, burden, countries, in, 2012, a, new, medication, regimen, was, approved, in, the, us, for, multidrug, resistant, tuberculosis, using, bedaquiline, as, well, as, existing, drugs, there, were, initial, concerns, about, the, safety, of, this, drug, but, later, research, on, larger, groups, found, that, this, regimen, improved, health, outcomes, by, 2017, the, drug, was, used, in, at, least, 89, countries, another, new, drug, is, delamanid, which, was, first, approved, by, the, european, medicines, agency, in, 2013, to, be, used, in, multidrug, resistant, tuberculosis, patients, and, by, 2017, was, used, in, at, least, 54, countries, steroids, add, on, therapy, has, not, shown, any, benefits, for, active, pulmonary, tuberculosis, infection, mycobacteria, infect, many, different, animals, including, birds, fish, rodents, and, reptiles, the, subspecies, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, though, is, rarely, present, in, wild, animals, an, effort, to, eradicate, bovine, tuberculosis, caused, by, mycobacterium, bovis, from, the, cattle, and, deer, herds, of, new, zealand, has, been, relatively, successful, efforts, in, great, britain, have, been, less, successful, as, of, 2015, tuberculosis, appears, to, be, widespread, among, captive, elephants, in, the, us, it, is, believed, that, the, animals, originally, acquired, the, disease, from, humans, a, process, called, reverse, zoonosis, because, the, disease, can, spread, through, the, air, to, infect, both, humans, and, other, animals, it, is, a, public, health, concern, affecting, circuses, and, zoos
