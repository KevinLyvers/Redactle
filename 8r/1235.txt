anesthesia, american, english, or, anaesthesia, british, english, is, a, state, of, controlled, temporary, loss, of, sensation, or, awareness, that, is, induced, for, medical, or, veterinary, purposes, it, may, include, some, or, all, of, analgesia, relief, from, or, prevention, of, pain, paralysis, muscle, relaxation, amnesia, loss, of, memory, and, unconsciousness, an, individual, under, the, effects, of, anesthetic, drugs, is, referred, to, as, being, anesthetized, anesthesia, enables, the, painless, performance, of, procedures, that, would, otherwise, require, physical, restraint, in, a, non, anesthetized, individual, or, would, otherwise, be, technically, unfeasible, three, broad, categories, of, anesthesia, exist, in, preparing, for, a, medical, or, veterinary, procedure, the, clinician, chooses, one, or, more, drugs, to, achieve, the, types, and, degree, of, anesthesia, characteristics, appropriate, for, the, type, of, procedure, and, the, particular, patient, the, types, of, drugs, used, include, general, anesthetics, local, anesthetics, hypnotics, dissociatives, sedatives, adjuncts, neuromuscular, blocking, drugs, narcotics, and, analgesics, the, risks, of, complications, during, or, after, anesthesia, are, often, difficult, to, separate, from, those, of, the, procedure, for, which, anesthesia, is, being, given, but, in, the, main, they, are, related, to, three, factors, the, health, of, the, individual, the, complexity, and, stress, of, the, procedure, itself, and, the, anaesthetic, technique, of, these, factors, the, individual, s, health, has, the, greatest, impact, major, perioperative, risks, can, include, death, heart, attack, and, pulmonary, embolism, whereas, minor, risks, can, include, postoperative, nausea, and, vomiting, and, hospital, readmission, some, conditions, like, local, anesthetic, toxicity, airway, trauma, or, malignant, hyperthermia, can, be, more, directly, attributed, to, specific, anesthetic, drugs, and, techniques, the, purpose, of, anesthesia, can, be, distilled, down, to, three, basic, goals, or, endpoints, 236, different, types, of, anesthesia, affect, the, endpoints, differently, regional, anesthesia, for, instance, affects, analgesia, benzodiazepine, type, sedatives, used, for, sedation, or, twilight, anesthesia, favor, amnesia, and, general, anesthetics, can, affect, all, of, the, endpoints, the, goal, of, anesthesia, is, to, achieve, the, endpoints, required, for, the, given, surgical, procedure, with, the, least, risk, to, the, subject, to, achieve, the, goals, of, anesthesia, drugs, act, on, different, but, interconnected, parts, of, the, nervous, system, hypnosis, for, instance, is, generated, through, actions, on, the, nuclei, in, the, brain, and, is, similar, to, the, activation, of, sleep, the, effect, is, to, make, people, less, aware, and, less, reactive, to, noxious, stimuli, 245, loss, of, memory, amnesia, is, created, by, action, of, drugs, on, multiple, but, specific, regions, of, the, brain, memories, are, created, as, either, declarative, or, non, declarative, memories, in, several, stages, short, term, long, term, long, lasting, the, strength, of, which, is, determined, by, the, strength, of, connections, between, neurons, termed, synaptic, plasticity, 246, each, anesthetic, produces, amnesia, through, unique, effects, on, memory, formation, at, variable, doses, inhalational, anesthetics, will, reliably, produce, amnesia, through, general, suppression, of, the, nuclei, at, doses, below, those, required, for, loss, of, consciousness, drugs, like, midazolam, produce, amnesia, through, different, pathways, by, blocking, the, formation, of, long, term, memories, 249, nevertheless, a, person, can, dream, under, anesthesia, or, are, conscious, of, the, procedure, despite, giving, no, indication, of, this, during, it, an, estimated, 22, of, people, do, dream, under, general, anesthesia, and, one, or, two, cases, in, a, thousand, have, some, consciousness, termed, anesthesia, awareness, 253, it, is, not, known, whether, animals, dream, while, under, general, anesthesia, anesthesia, is, unique, in, that, it, is, not, a, direct, means, of, treatment, rather, it, allows, the, clinician, to, do, things, that, may, treat, diagnose, or, cure, an, ailment, which, would, otherwise, be, painful, or, complicated, the, best, anesthetic, therefore, is, the, one, with, the, lowest, risk, to, the, patient, that, still, achieves, the, endpoints, required, to, complete, the, procedure, the, first, stage, in, anesthesia, is, the, pre, operative, risk, assessment, consisting, of, the, medical, history, physical, examination, and, lab, tests, diagnosing, the, patient, s, pre, operative, physical, status, allows, the, clinician, to, minimize, anesthetic, risks, a, well, completed, medical, history, will, arrive, at, the, correct, diagnosis, 56, of, the, time, which, increases, to, 73, with, a, physical, examination, lab, tests, help, in, diagnosis, but, only, in, 3, of, cases, underscoring, the, need, for, a, full, history, and, physical, examination, prior, to, anesthetics, incorrect, pre, operative, assessments, or, preparations, are, the, root, cause, of, 11, of, all, adverse, anesthetic, events, 1003, safe, anesthesia, care, depends, greatly, on, well, functioning, teams, of, highly, trained, healthcare, workers, the, medical, specialty, centred, around, anesthesia, is, called, anesthesiology, and, doctors, specialised, in, the, field, are, termed, anesthesiologists, additional, healthcare, professionals, involved, in, anesthesia, provision, have, varying, titles, and, roles, depending, on, the, jurisdiction, and, include, anesthetic, nurses, nurse, anesthetists, anesthesiologist, assistants, anaesthetic, technicians, anaesthesia, associates, operating, department, practitioners, and, anesthesia, technologists, international, standards, for, the, safe, practice, of, anesthesia, jointly, endorsed, by, the, world, health, organization, and, the, world, federation, of, societies, of, anaesthesiologists, highly, recommend, that, anesthesia, should, be, provided, overseen, or, led, by, anesthesiologists, with, the, exception, of, minimal, sedation, or, superficial, procedures, performed, under, local, anesthesia, a, trained, vigilant, anesthesia, provider, should, continually, care, for, the, patient, where, the, provider, is, not, an, anesthesiologist, they, should, be, locally, directed, and, supervised, by, an, anesthesiologist, and, in, countries, or, settings, where, this, is, not, feasible, care, should, be, led, by, the, most, qualified, local, individual, within, a, regional, or, national, anesthesiologist, led, framework, the, same, minimum, standards, for, patient, safety, apply, regardless, of, the, provider, including, continuous, clinical, and, biometric, monitoring, of, tissue, oxygenation, perfusion, and, blood, pressure, confirmation, of, correct, placement, of, airway, management, devices, by, auscultation, and, carbon, dioxide, detection, use, of, the, who, surgical, safety, checklist, and, safe, onward, transfer, of, the, patient, s, care, following, the, procedure, one, part, of, the, risk, assessment, is, based, on, the, patient, s, health, the, american, society, of, anesthesiologists, has, developed, a, six, tier, scale, that, stratifies, the, patient, s, pre, operative, physical, state, it, is, called, the, asa, physical, status, classification, the, scale, assesses, risk, as, the, patient, s, general, health, relates, to, an, anesthetic, the, more, detailed, pre, operative, medical, history, aims, to, discover, genetic, disorders, such, as, malignant, hyperthermia, or, pseudocholinesterase, deficiency, habits, tobacco, drug, and, alcohol, use, physical, attributes, such, as, obesity, or, a, difficult, airway, and, any, coexisting, diseases, especially, cardiac, and, respiratory, diseases, that, might, impact, the, anesthetic, the, physical, examination, helps, quantify, the, impact, of, anything, found, in, the, medical, history, in, addition, to, lab, tests, 1003, 09, aside, from, the, generalities, of, the, patient, s, health, assessment, an, evaluation, of, specific, factors, as, they, relate, to, the, surgery, also, need, to, be, considered, for, anesthesia, for, instance, anesthesia, during, childbirth, must, consider, not, only, the, mother, but, the, baby, cancers, and, tumors, that, occupy, the, lungs, or, throat, create, special, challenges, to, general, anesthesia, after, determining, the, health, of, the, patient, undergoing, anesthesia, and, the, endpoints, that, are, required, to, complete, the, procedure, the, type, of, anesthetic, can, be, selected, choice, of, surgical, method, and, anesthetic, technique, aims, to, reduce, risk, of, complications, shorten, time, needed, for, recovery, and, minimize, the, surgical, stress, response, anesthesia, is, a, combination, of, the, endpoints, discussed, above, that, are, reached, by, drugs, acting, on, different, but, overlapping, sites, in, the, central, nervous, system, general, anesthesia, as, opposed, to, sedation, or, regional, anesthesia, has, three, main, goals, lack, of, movement, paralysis, unconsciousness, and, blunting, of, the, stress, response, in, the, early, days, of, anesthesia, anesthetics, could, reliably, achieve, the, first, two, allowing, surgeons, to, perform, necessary, procedures, but, many, patients, died, because, the, extremes, of, blood, pressure, and, pulse, caused, by, the, surgical, insult, were, ultimately, harmful, eventually, the, need, for, blunting, of, the, surgical, stress, response, was, identified, by, harvey, cushing, who, injected, local, anesthetic, prior, to, hernia, repairs, 30, this, led, to, the, development, of, other, drugs, that, could, blunt, the, response, leading, to, lower, surgical, mortality, rates, the, most, common, approach, to, reach, the, endpoints, of, general, anesthesia, is, through, the, use, of, inhaled, general, anesthetics, each, anesthetic, has, its, own, potency, which, is, correlated, to, its, solubility, in, oil, this, relationship, exists, because, the, drugs, bind, directly, to, cavities, in, proteins, of, the, central, nervous, system, although, several, theories, of, general, anesthetic, action, have, been, described, inhalational, anesthetics, are, thought, to, exact, their, effects, on, different, parts, of, the, central, nervous, system, for, instance, the, immobilizing, effect, of, inhaled, anesthetics, results, from, an, effect, on, the, spinal, cord, whereas, sedation, hypnosis, and, amnesia, involve, sites, in, the, brain, 515, the, potency, of, an, inhalational, anesthetic, is, quantified, by, its, minimum, alveolar, concentration, mac, the, mac, is, the, percentage, dose, of, anesthetic, that, will, prevent, a, response, to, painful, stimulus, in, 50, of, subjects, the, higher, the, mac, generally, the, less, potent, the, anesthetic, the, ideal, anesthetic, drug, would, provide, hypnosis, amnesia, analgesia, and, muscle, relaxation, without, undesirable, changes, in, blood, pressure, pulse, or, breathing, in, the, 1930s, physicians, started, to, augment, inhaled, general, anesthetics, with, intravenous, general, anesthetics, the, drugs, used, in, combination, offered, a, better, risk, profile, to, the, subject, under, anesthesia, and, a, quicker, recovery, a, combination, of, drugs, was, later, shown, to, result, in, lower, odds, of, dying, in, the, first, seven, days, after, anesthetic, for, instance, propofol, injection, might, be, used, to, start, the, anesthetic, fentanyl, injection, used, to, blunt, the, stress, response, midazolam, injection, given, to, ensure, amnesia, and, sevoflurane, inhaled, during, the, procedure, to, maintain, the, effects, more, recently, several, intravenous, drugs, have, been, developed, which, if, desired, allow, inhaled, general, anesthetics, to, be, avoided, completely, 720, the, core, instrument, in, an, inhalational, anesthetic, delivery, system, is, an, anesthetic, machine, it, has, vaporizers, ventilators, an, anesthetic, breathing, circuit, waste, gas, scavenging, system, and, pressure, gauges, the, purpose, of, the, anesthetic, machine, is, to, provide, anesthetic, gas, at, a, constant, pressure, oxygen, for, breathing, and, to, remove, carbon, dioxide, or, other, waste, anesthetic, gases, since, inhalational, anesthetics, are, flammable, various, checklists, have, been, developed, to, confirm, that, the, machine, is, ready, for, use, that, the, safety, features, are, active, and, the, electrical, hazards, are, removed, intravenous, anesthetic, is, delivered, either, by, bolus, doses, or, an, infusion, pump, there, are, also, many, smaller, instruments, used, in, airway, management, and, monitoring, the, patient, the, common, thread, to, modern, machinery, in, this, field, is, the, use, of, fail, safe, systems, that, decrease, the, odds, of, catastrophic, misuse, of, the, machine, patients, under, general, anesthesia, must, undergo, continuous, physiological, monitoring, to, ensure, safety, in, the, us, the, american, society, of, anesthesiologists, asa, has, established, minimum, monitoring, guidelines, for, patients, receiving, general, anesthesia, regional, anesthesia, or, sedation, these, include, electrocardiography, ecg, heart, rate, blood, pressure, inspired, and, expired, gases, oxygen, saturation, of, the, blood, pulse, oximetry, and, temperature, in, the, uk, the, association, of, anaesthetists, aagbi, have, set, minimum, monitoring, guidelines, for, general, and, regional, anesthesia, for, minor, surgery, this, generally, includes, monitoring, of, heart, rate, oxygen, saturation, blood, pressure, and, inspired, and, expired, concentrations, for, oxygen, carbon, dioxide, and, inhalational, anesthetic, agents, for, more, invasive, surgery, monitoring, may, also, include, temperature, urine, output, blood, pressure, central, venous, pressure, pulmonary, artery, pressure, and, pulmonary, artery, occlusion, pressure, cardiac, output, cerebral, activity, and, neuromuscular, function, in, addition, the, operating, room, environment, must, be, monitored, for, ambient, temperature, and, humidity, as, well, as, for, accumulation, of, exhaled, inhalational, anesthetic, agents, which, might, be, deleterious, to, the, health, of, operating, room, personnel, sedation, also, referred, to, as, dissociative, anesthesia, or, twilight, anesthesia, creates, hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, amnesic, anticonvulsant, and, centrally, produced, muscle, relaxing, properties, from, the, perspective, of, the, person, giving, the, sedation, the, patient, appears, sleepy, relaxed, and, forgetful, allowing, unpleasant, procedures, to, be, more, easily, completed, sedatives, such, as, benzodiazepines, are, usually, given, with, pain, relievers, such, as, narcotics, or, local, anesthetics, or, both, because, they, do, not, by, themselves, provide, significant, pain, relief, from, the, perspective, of, the, subject, receiving, a, sedative, the, effect, is, a, feeling, of, general, relaxation, amnesia, loss, of, memory, and, time, passing, quickly, many, drugs, can, produce, a, sedative, effect, including, benzodiazepines, propofol, thiopental, ketamine, and, inhaled, general, anesthetics, the, advantage, of, sedation, over, a, general, anesthetic, is, that, it, generally, does, not, require, support, of, the, airway, or, breathing, no, tracheal, intubation, or, mechanical, ventilation, and, can, have, less, of, an, effect, on, the, cardiovascular, system, which, may, add, to, a, greater, margin, of, safety, in, some, patients, 736, when, pain, is, blocked, from, a, part, of, the, body, using, local, anesthetics, it, is, generally, referred, to, as, regional, anesthesia, there, are, many, types, of, regional, anesthesia, either, by, injecting, into, the, tissue, itself, a, vein, that, feeds, the, area, or, around, a, nerve, trunk, that, supplies, sensation, to, the, area, the, latter, are, called, nerve, blocks, and, are, divided, into, peripheral, or, central, nerve, blocks, the, following, are, the, types, of, regional, anesthesia, 926, 31, a, 2018, cochrane, review, found, moderate, quality, evidence, that, regional, anesthesia, may, reduce, the, frequency, of, persistent, postoperative, pain, ppp, from, 3, to, 18, months, following, thoracotomy, and, 3, to, 12, months, following, caesarean, low, quality, evidence, was, found, 3, to, 12, months, following, breast, cancer, surgery, this, review, acknowledges, certain, limitations, that, impact, its, applicability, beyond, the, surgeries, and, regional, anesthesia, techniques, reviewed, when, local, anesthetic, is, injected, around, a, larger, diameter, nerve, that, transmits, sensation, from, an, entire, region, it, is, referred, to, as, a, nerve, block, or, regional, nerve, blockade, nerve, blocks, are, commonly, used, in, dentistry, when, the, mandibular, nerve, is, blocked, for, procedures, on, the, lower, teeth, with, larger, diameter, nerves, such, as, the, interscalene, block, for, upper, limbs, or, psoas, compartment, block, for, lower, limbs, the, nerve, and, position, of, the, needle, is, localized, with, ultrasound, or, electrical, stimulation, evidence, supports, the, use, of, ultrasound, guidance, alone, or, in, combination, with, peripheral, nerve, stimulation, as, superior, for, improved, sensory, and, motor, block, a, reduction, in, the, need, for, supplementation, and, fewer, complications, because, of, the, large, amount, of, local, anesthetic, required, to, affect, the, nerve, the, maximum, dose, of, local, anesthetic, has, to, be, considered, nerve, blocks, are, also, used, as, a, continuous, infusion, following, major, surgery, such, as, knee, hip, and, shoulder, replacement, surgery, and, may, be, associated, with, lower, complications, nerve, blocks, are, also, associated, with, a, lower, risk, of, neurologic, complications, compared, to, the, more, central, epidural, or, spinal, neuraxial, blocks, 1639, 41, central, neuraxial, anesthesia, is, the, injection, of, local, anesthetic, around, the, spinal, cord, to, provide, analgesia, in, the, abdomen, pelvis, or, lower, extremities, it, is, divided, into, either, spinal, injection, into, the, subarachnoid, space, epidural, injection, outside, of, the, subarachnoid, space, into, the, epidural, space, and, caudal, injection, into, the, cauda, equina, or, tail, end, of, the, spinal, cord, spinal, and, epidural, are, the, most, commonly, used, forms, of, central, neuraxial, blockade, spinal, anesthesia, is, a, one, shot, injection, that, provides, rapid, onset, and, profound, sensory, anesthesia, with, lower, doses, of, anesthetic, and, is, usually, associated, with, neuromuscular, blockade, loss, of, muscle, control, epidural, anesthesia, uses, larger, doses, of, anesthetic, infused, through, an, indwelling, catheter, which, allows, the, anesthetic, to, be, augmented, should, the, effects, begin, to, dissipate, epidural, anesthesia, does, not, typically, affect, muscle, control, because, central, neuraxial, blockade, causes, arterial, and, venous, vasodilation, a, drop, in, blood, pressure, is, common, this, drop, is, largely, dictated, by, the, venous, side, of, the, circulatory, system, which, holds, 75, of, the, circulating, blood, volume, the, physiologic, effects, are, much, greater, when, the, block, is, placed, above, the, 5th, thoracic, vertebra, an, ineffective, block, is, most, often, due, to, inadequate, anxiolysis, or, sedation, rather, than, a, failure, of, the, block, itself, 1611, nociception, pain, sensation, is, not, hard, wired, into, the, body, instead, it, is, a, dynamic, process, wherein, persistent, painful, stimuli, can, sensitize, the, system, and, either, make, pain, management, difficult, or, promote, the, development, of, chronic, pain, for, this, reason, preemptive, acute, pain, management, may, reduce, both, acute, and, chronic, pain, and, is, tailored, to, the, surgery, the, environment, in, which, it, is, given, in, patient, out, patient, and, the, individual, 2757, pain, management, is, classified, into, either, pre, emptive, or, on, demand, on, demand, pain, medications, typically, include, either, opioid, or, non, steroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, but, can, also, make, use, of, novel, approaches, such, as, inhaled, nitrous, oxide, or, ketamine, on, demand, drugs, can, be, administered, by, a, clinician, as, needed, drug, orders, or, by, the, patient, using, patient, controlled, analgesia, pca, pca, has, been, shown, to, provide, slightly, better, pain, control, and, increased, patient, satisfaction, when, compared, with, conventional, methods, common, preemptive, approaches, include, epidural, neuraxial, blockade, or, nerve, blocks, one, review, which, looked, at, pain, control, after, abdominal, aortic, surgery, found, that, epidural, blockade, provides, better, pain, relief, especially, during, movement, in, the, period, up, to, three, postoperative, days, it, reduces, the, duration, of, postoperative, tracheal, intubation, by, roughly, half, the, occurrence, of, prolonged, postoperative, mechanical, ventilation, and, myocardial, infarction, is, also, reduced, by, epidural, analgesia, risks, and, complications, as, they, relate, to, anesthesia, are, classified, as, either, morbidity, a, disease, or, disorder, that, results, from, anesthesia, or, mortality, death, that, results, from, anesthesia, quantifying, how, anesthesia, contributes, to, morbidity, and, mortality, can, be, difficult, because, the, patient, s, health, prior, to, surgery, and, the, complexity, of, the, surgical, procedure, can, also, contribute, to, the, risks, prior, to, the, introduction, of, anesthesia, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, physiologic, stress, from, surgery, caused, significant, complications, and, many, deaths, from, shock, the, faster, the, surgery, was, the, lower, the, rate, of, complications, leading, to, reports, of, very, quick, amputations, the, advent, of, anesthesia, allowed, more, complicated, and, life, saving, surgery, to, be, completed, decreased, the, physiologic, stress, of, the, surgery, but, added, an, element, of, risk, it, was, two, years, after, the, introduction, of, ether, anesthetics, that, the, first, death, directly, related, to, the, use, of, anesthesia, was, reported, morbidity, can, be, major, myocardial, infarction, pneumonia, pulmonary, embolism, kidney, failure, chronic, kidney, disease, postoperative, cognitive, dysfunction, and, allergy, or, minor, minor, nausea, vomiting, readmission, there, is, usually, overlap, in, the, contributing, factors, that, lead, to, morbidity, and, mortality, between, the, health, of, the, patients, the, type, of, surgery, being, performed, and, the, anesthetic, to, understand, the, relative, risk, of, each, contributing, factor, consider, that, the, rate, of, deaths, totally, attributed, to, the, patient, s, health, is, 1, 870, compare, that, to, the, rate, of, deaths, totally, attributed, to, surgical, factors, 1, 2860, or, anesthesia, alone, 1, 185, 056, illustrating, that, the, single, greatest, factor, in, anesthetic, mortality, is, the, health, of, the, patient, these, statistics, can, also, be, compared, to, the, first, such, study, on, mortality, in, anesthesia, from, 1954, which, reported, a, rate, of, death, from, all, causes, at, 1, 75, and, a, rate, attributed, to, anesthesia, alone, at, 1, 2680, 993, direct, comparisons, between, mortality, statistics, cannot, reliably, be, made, over, time, and, across, countries, because, of, differences, in, the, stratification, of, risk, factors, however, there, is, evidence, that, anesthetics, have, made, a, significant, improvement, in, safety, but, to, what, degree, is, uncertain, rather, than, stating, a, flat, rate, of, morbidity, or, mortality, many, factors, are, reported, as, contributing, to, the, relative, risk, of, the, procedure, and, anesthetic, combined, for, instance, an, operation, on, a, person, who, is, between, the, ages, of, 60, 79, years, old, places, the, patient, at, 2, 3, times, greater, risk, than, someone, less, than, 60, years, old, having, an, asa, score, of, 3, 4, or, 5, places, the, person, at, 10, 7, times, greater, risk, than, someone, with, an, asa, score, of, 1, or, 2, other, variables, include, age, greater, than, 80, 3, 3, times, risk, compared, to, those, under, 60, gender, females, have, a, lower, risk, of, 0, 8, urgency, of, the, procedure, emergencies, have, a, 4, 4, times, greater, risk, experience, of, the, person, completing, the, procedure, less, than, 8, years, experience, and, or, less, than, 600, cases, have, a, 1, 1, times, greater, risk, and, the, type, of, anesthetic, regional, anesthetics, are, lower, risk, than, general, anesthetics, 984, obstetrical, the, very, young, and, the, very, old, are, all, at, greater, risk, of, complication, so, extra, precautions, may, need, to, be, taken, 969, 86, on, 14, december, 2016, the, food, and, drug, administration, issued, a, public, safety, communication, warning, that, repeated, or, lengthy, use, of, general, anesthetic, and, sedation, drugs, during, surgeries, or, procedures, in, children, younger, than, 3, years, or, in, pregnant, women, during, their, third, trimester, may, affect, the, development, of, children, s, brains, the, warning, was, criticized, by, the, american, college, of, obstetricians, and, gynecologists, which, pointed, out, the, absence, of, direct, evidence, regarding, use, in, pregnant, women, and, the, possibility, that, this, warning, could, inappropriately, dissuade, providers, from, providing, medically, indicated, care, during, pregnancy, patient, advocates, noted, that, a, randomized, clinical, trial, would, be, unethical, that, the, mechanism, of, injury, is, well, established, in, animals, and, that, studies, had, shown, exposure, to, multiple, uses, of, anesthetic, significantly, increased, the, risk, of, developing, learning, disabilities, in, young, children, with, a, hazard, ratio, of, 2, 12, 95, confidence, interval, 1, 26, 3, 54, the, immediate, time, after, anesthesia, is, called, emergence, emergence, from, general, anesthesia, or, sedation, requires, careful, monitoring, because, there, is, still, a, risk, of, complication, nausea, and, vomiting, are, reported, at, 9, 8, but, will, vary, with, the, type, of, anesthetic, and, procedure, there, is, a, need, for, airway, support, in, 6, 8, there, can, be, urinary, retention, more, common, in, those, over, 50, years, of, age, and, hypotension, in, 2, 7, hypothermia, shivering, and, confusion, are, also, common, in, the, immediate, post, operative, period, because, of, the, lack, of, muscle, movement, and, subsequent, lack, of, heat, production, during, the, procedure, 2707, furthermore, the, rare, manifestation, in, the, post, anesthetic, period, may, be, the, occurrence, of, functional, neurological, symptom, disorder, fnsd, postoperative, cognitive, dysfunction, also, known, as, pocd, and, post, anesthetic, confusion, is, a, disturbance, in, cognition, after, surgery, it, may, also, be, variably, used, to, describe, emergence, delirium, immediate, post, operative, confusion, and, early, cognitive, dysfunction, diminished, cognitive, function, in, the, first, post, operative, week, although, the, three, entities, delirium, early, pocd, and, long, term, pocd, are, separate, the, presence, of, delirium, post, operatively, predicts, the, presence, of, early, pocd, there, does, not, appear, to, be, an, association, between, delirium, or, early, pocd, and, long, term, pocd, according, to, a, recent, study, conducted, at, the, david, geffen, school, of, medicine, at, ucla, the, brain, navigates, its, way, through, a, series, of, activity, clusters, or, hubs, on, its, way, back, to, consciousness, andrew, hudson, an, assistant, professor, in, anesthesiology, states, recovery, from, anesthesia, is, not, simply, the, result, of, the, anesthetic, wearing, off, but, also, of, the, brain, finding, its, way, back, through, a, maze, of, possible, activity, states, to, those, that, allow, conscious, experience, put, simply, the, brain, reboots, itself, long, term, pocd, is, a, subtle, deterioration, in, cognitive, function, that, can, last, for, weeks, months, or, longer, most, commonly, relatives, of, the, person, report, a, lack, of, attention, memory, and, loss, of, interest, in, activities, previously, dear, to, the, person, such, as, crosswords, in, a, similar, way, people, in, the, workforce, may, report, an, inability, to, complete, tasks, at, the, same, speed, they, could, previously, there, is, good, evidence, that, pocd, occurs, after, cardiac, surgery, and, the, major, reason, for, its, occurrence, is, the, formation, of, microemboli, pocd, also, appears, to, occur, in, non, cardiac, surgery, its, causes, in, non, cardiac, surgery, are, less, clear, but, older, age, is, a, risk, factor, for, its, occurrence, 2805, 16, the, first, attempts, at, general, anesthesia, were, probably, herbal, remedies, administered, in, prehistory, alcohol, is, one, of, the, oldest, known, sedatives, and, it, was, used, in, ancient, mesopotamia, thousands, of, years, ago, the, sumerians, are, said, to, have, cultivated, and, harvested, the, opium, poppy, papaver, somniferum, in, lower, mesopotamia, as, early, as, 3400, bce, the, ancient, egyptians, had, some, surgical, instruments, as, well, as, crude, analgesics, and, sedatives, including, possibly, an, extract, prepared, from, the, mandrake, fruit, in, china, bian, que, chinese, wade, giles, pien, ch, iao, c, 300, bce, was, a, legendary, chinese, internist, and, surgeon, who, reportedly, used, general, anesthesia, for, surgical, procedures, despite, this, it, was, the, chinese, physician, hua, tuo, whom, historians, considered, the, first, verifiable, historical, figure, to, develop, a, type, of, mixture, of, anesthesia, though, his, recipe, has, yet, to, be, fully, discovered, throughout, europe, asia, and, the, americas, a, variety, of, solanum, species, containing, potent, tropane, alkaloids, was, used, for, anesthesia, in, 13th, century, italy, theodoric, borgognoni, used, similar, mixtures, along, with, opiates, to, induce, unconsciousness, and, treatment, with, the, combined, alkaloids, proved, a, mainstay, of, anesthesia, until, the, 19th, century, local, anesthetics, were, used, in, inca, civilization, where, shamans, chewed, coca, leaves, and, performed, operations, on, the, skull, while, spitting, into, the, wounds, they, had, inflicted, to, anesthetize, cocaine, was, later, isolated, and, became, the, first, effective, local, anesthetic, it, was, first, used, in, eye, surgery, in, 1884, by, karl, koller, at, the, suggestion, of, sigmund, freud, german, surgeon, august, bier, 1861, 1949, was, the, first, to, use, cocaine, for, intrathecal, anesthesia, in, 1898, romanian, surgeon, nicolae, racoviceanu, pite, ti, 1860, 1942, was, the, first, to, use, opioids, for, intrathecal, analgesia, he, presented, his, experience, in, paris, in, 1901, the, soporific, sponge, sleep, sponge, used, by, arabic, physicians, was, introduced, to, europe, by, the, salerno, school, of, medicine, in, the, late, 12th, century, and, by, ugo, borgognoni, 1180, 1258, in, the, 13th, century, the, sponge, was, promoted, and, described, by, ugo, s, son, and, fellow, surgeon, theodoric, borgognoni, 1205, 1298, in, this, anesthetic, method, a, sponge, was, soaked, in, a, dissolved, solution, of, opium, mandragora, hemlock, juice, and, other, substances, the, sponge, was, then, dried, and, stored, just, before, surgery, the, sponge, was, moistened, and, then, held, under, the, patient, s, nose, when, all, went, well, the, fumes, rendered, the, individual, unconscious, the, most, famous, anesthetic, ether, may, have, been, synthesized, as, early, as, the, 8th, century, but, it, took, many, centuries, for, its, anesthetic, importance, to, be, appreciated, even, though, the, 16th, century, physician, and, polymath, paracelsus, noted, that, chickens, made, to, breathe, it, not, only, fell, asleep, but, also, felt, no, pain, by, the, early, 19th, century, ether, was, being, used, by, humans, but, only, as, a, recreational, drug, meanwhile, in, 1772, english, scientist, joseph, priestley, discovered, the, gas, nitrous, oxide, initially, people, thought, this, gas, to, be, lethal, even, in, small, doses, like, some, other, nitrogen, oxides, however, in, 1799, british, chemist, and, inventor, humphry, davy, decided, to, find, out, by, experimenting, on, himself, to, his, astonishment, he, found, that, nitrous, oxide, made, him, laugh, so, he, nicknamed, it, laughing, gas, in, 1800, davy, wrote, about, the, potential, anesthetic, properties, of, nitrous, oxide, in, relieving, pain, during, surgery, but, nobody, at, that, time, pursued, the, matter, any, further, on, 14, november, 1804, hanaoka, seish, a, japanese, doctor, became, the, first, person, to, successfully, perform, surgery, using, general, anesthesia, hanaoka, learned, traditional, japanese, medicine, as, well, as, dutch, imported, european, surgery, and, chinese, medicine, after, years, of, research, and, experimentation, he, finally, developed, a, formula, which, he, named, ts, sensan, also, known, as, mafutsu, san, which, combined, korean, morning, glory, and, other, herbs, hanaoka, s, success, in, performing, this, painless, operation, soon, became, widely, known, and, patients, began, to, arrive, from, all, parts, of, japan, hanaoka, went, on, to, perform, many, operations, using, ts, sensan, including, resection, of, malignant, tumors, extraction, of, bladder, stones, and, extremity, amputations, before, his, death, in, 1835, hanaoka, performed, more, than, 150, operations, for, breast, cancer, however, this, finding, did, not, benefit, the, rest, of, the, world, until, 1854, as, the, national, isolation, policy, of, the, tokugawa, shogunate, prevented, hanaoka, s, achievements, from, being, publicized, until, after, the, isolation, ended, nearly, forty, years, would, pass, before, crawford, long, who, is, titled, as, the, inventor, of, modern, anesthetics, in, the, west, used, general, anesthesia, in, jefferson, georgia, long, noticed, that, his, friends, felt, no, pain, when, they, injured, themselves, while, staggering, around, under, the, influence, of, diethyl, ether, he, immediately, thought, of, its, potential, in, surgery, conveniently, a, participant, in, one, of, those, ether, frolics, a, student, named, james, venable, had, two, small, tumors, he, wanted, excised, but, fearing, the, pain, of, surgery, venable, kept, putting, the, operation, off, hence, long, suggested, that, he, have, his, operation, while, under, the, influence, of, ether, venable, agreed, and, on, 30, march, 1842, he, underwent, a, painless, operation, however, long, did, not, announce, his, discovery, until, 1849, horace, wells, conducted, the, first, public, demonstration, of, the, inhalational, anesthetic, at, the, massachusetts, general, hospital, in, boston, in, 1845, however, the, nitrous, oxide, was, improperly, administered, and, the, person, cried, out, in, pain, on, 16, october, 1846, boston, dentist, william, thomas, green, morton, gave, a, successful, demonstration, using, diethyl, ether, to, medical, students, at, the, same, venue, morton, who, was, unaware, of, long, s, previous, work, was, invited, to, the, massachusetts, general, hospital, to, demonstrate, his, new, technique, for, painless, surgery, after, morton, had, induced, anesthesia, surgeon, john, collins, warren, removed, a, tumor, from, the, neck, of, edward, gilbert, abbott, this, occurred, in, the, surgical, amphitheater, now, called, the, ether, dome, the, previously, skeptical, warren, was, impressed, and, stated, gentlemen, this, is, no, humbug, in, a, letter, to, morton, shortly, thereafter, physician, and, writer, oliver, wendell, holmes, sr, proposed, naming, the, state, produced, anesthesia, and, the, procedure, an, anesthetic, morton, at, first, attempted, to, hide, the, actual, nature, of, his, anesthetic, substance, referring, to, it, as, letheon, he, received, a, us, patent, for, his, substance, but, news, of, the, successful, anesthetic, spread, quickly, by, late, 1846, respected, surgeons, in, europe, including, liston, dieffenbach, pirogov, and, syme, quickly, undertook, numerous, operations, with, ether, an, american, born, physician, boott, encouraged, london, dentist, james, robinson, to, perform, a, dental, procedure, on, a, miss, lonsdale, this, was, the, first, case, of, an, operator, anesthetist, on, the, same, day, 19, december, 1846, in, dumfries, royal, infirmary, scotland, a, dr, scott, used, ether, for, a, surgical, procedure, the, first, use, of, anesthesia, in, the, southern, hemisphere, took, place, in, launceston, tasmania, that, same, year, drawbacks, with, ether, such, as, excessive, vomiting, and, its, explosive, flammability, led, to, its, replacement, in, england, with, chloroform, discovered, in, 1831, by, an, american, physician, samuel, guthrie, 1782, 1848, and, independently, a, few, months, later, by, frenchman, eug, ne, soubeiran, 1797, 1859, and, justus, von, liebig, 1803, 1873, in, germany, chloroform, was, named, and, chemically, characterized, in, 1834, by, jean, baptiste, dumas, 1800, 1884, in, 1842, dr, robert, mortimer, glover, in, london, discovered, the, anaesthetic, qualities, of, chloroform, on, laboratory, animals, in, 1847, scottish, obstetrician, james, young, simpson, was, the, first, to, demonstrate, the, anesthetic, properties, of, chloroform, on, humans, and, helped, to, popularize, the, drug, for, use, in, medicine, this, first, supply, came, from, local, pharmacists, james, duncan, and, william, flockhart, and, its, use, spread, quickly, with, 750, 000, doses, weekly, in, britain, by, 1895, simpson, arranged, for, flockhart, to, supply, florence, nightingale, chloroform, gained, royal, approval, in, 1853, when, john, snow, administered, it, to, queen, victoria, when, she, was, in, labor, with, prince, leopold, for, the, experience, of, child, birth, itself, chloroform, met, all, the, queen, s, expectations, she, stated, it, was, delightful, beyond, measure, chloroform, was, not, without, fault, though, the, first, fatality, directly, attributed, to, chloroform, administration, was, recorded, on, 28, january, 1848, after, the, death, of, hannah, greener, this, was, the, first, of, many, deaths, to, follow, from, the, untrained, handling, of, chloroform, surgeons, began, to, appreciate, the, need, for, a, trained, anesthetist, the, need, as, thatcher, writes, was, for, an, anesthetist, to, 1, be, satisfied, with, the, subordinate, role, that, the, work, would, require, 2, make, anesthesia, their, one, absorbing, interest, 3, not, look, at, the, situation, of, anesthetist, as, one, that, put, them, in, a, position, to, watch, and, learn, from, the, surgeons, technique, 4, accept, the, comparatively, low, pay, and, 5, have, the, natural, aptitude, and, intelligence, to, develop, a, high, level, of, skill, in, providing, the, smooth, anesthesia, and, relaxation, that, the, surgeon, demanded, these, qualities, of, an, anesthetist, were, often, found, in, submissive, medical, students, and, even, members, of, the, public, more, often, surgeons, sought, out, nurses, to, provide, anesthesia, by, the, time, of, the, civil, war, many, nurses, had, been, professionally, trained, with, the, support, of, surgeons, john, snow, of, london, published, articles, from, may, 1848, onwards, on, narcotism, by, the, inhalation, of, vapours, in, the, london, medical, gazette, snow, also, involved, himself, in, the, production, of, equipment, needed, for, the, administration, of, inhalational, anesthetics, the, forerunner, of, today, s, anesthesia, machines, alice, magaw, born, in, november, 1860, is, often, referred, to, as, the, mother, of, anesthesia, her, renown, as, the, personal, anesthesia, provider, for, william, and, charles, mayo, was, solidified, by, mayo, s, own, words, in, his, 1905, article, in, which, he, described, his, satisfaction, with, and, reliance, on, nurse, anesthetists, the, question, of, anaesthesia, is, a, most, important, one, we, have, regular, anaesthetists, whom, we, can, depend, so, that, i, can, devote, my, entire, attention, to, the, surgical, work, magaw, kept, thorough, records, of, her, cases, and, recorded, these, anesthetics, in, her, publication, reviewing, more, than, 14, 000, surgical, anesthetics, magaw, indicates, she, successfully, provided, anesthesia, without, an, anesthetic, related, death, magaw, describes, in, another, article, we, have, administered, an, anesthetic, 1, 092, times, ether, alone, 674, times, chloroform, 245, times, ether, and, chloroform, combined, 173, times, i, can, report, that, out, of, this, number, 1, 092, cases, we, have, not, had, an, accident, magaw, s, records, and, outcomes, created, a, legacy, defining, that, the, delivery, of, anesthesia, by, nurses, would, serve, the, surgical, community, without, increasing, the, risks, to, patients, in, fact, magaw, s, outcomes, would, eclipse, those, of, practitioners, today, the, first, comprehensive, medical, textbook, on, the, subject, anesthesia, was, authored, in, 1914, by, anesthesiologist, dr, james, tayloe, gwathmey, and, the, chemist, dr, charles, baskerville, this, book, served, as, the, standard, reference, for, the, specialty, for, decades, and, included, details, on, the, history, of, anesthesia, as, well, as, the, physiology, and, techniques, of, inhalation, rectal, intravenous, and, spinal, anesthesia, of, these, first, famous, anesthetics, only, nitrous, oxide, is, still, widely, used, today, with, chloroform, and, ether, having, been, replaced, by, safer, but, sometimes, more, expensive, general, anesthetics, and, cocaine, by, more, effective, local, anesthetics, with, less, abuse, potential, almost, all, healthcare, providers, use, anesthetic, drugs, to, some, degree, but, most, health, professions, have, their, own, field, of, specialists, in, the, field, including, medicine, nursing, and, dentistry, doctors, specializing, in, anaesthesiology, including, perioperative, care, development, of, an, anesthetic, plan, and, the, administration, of, anesthetics, are, known, in, the, us, as, anesthesiologists, and, in, the, uk, canada, australia, and, nz, as, anaesthetists, or, anaesthesiologists, all, anesthetics, in, the, uk, australia, new, zealand, hong, kong, and, japan, are, administered, by, doctors, nurse, anesthetists, also, administer, anesthesia, in, 109, nations, in, the, us, 35, of, anesthetics, are, provided, by, physicians, in, solo, practice, about, 55, are, provided, by, anesthesia, care, teams, acts, with, anesthesiologists, medically, directing, certified, registered, nurse, anesthetists, crnas, or, anesthesiologist, assistants, and, about, 10, are, provided, by, crnas, in, solo, practice, there, can, also, be, anesthesiologist, assistants, us, or, physicians, assistants, anaesthesia, uk, who, assist, with, anesthesia, there, are, many, circumstances, when, anesthesia, needs, to, be, altered, for, special, circumstances, due, to, the, procedure, such, as, in, cardiac, surgery, cardiothoracic, anesthesiology, or, neurosurgery, the, patient, such, as, in, pediatric, anesthesia, geriatric, bariatric, or, obstetrical, anesthesia, or, special, circumstances, such, as, in, trauma, prehospital, care, robotic, surgery, or, extreme, environments
