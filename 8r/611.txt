old, world, vultures, are, vultures, that, are, found, in, the, old, world, i, e, the, continents, of, europe, asia, and, africa, and, which, belong, to, the, family, accipitridae, which, also, includes, eagles, buzzards, kites, and, hawks, old, world, vultures, are, not, closely, related, to, the, superficially, similar, new, world, vultures, and, condors, and, do, not, share, that, group, s, good, sense, of, smell, the, similarities, between, the, two, groups, of, vultures, are, due, to, convergent, evolution, rather, than, a, close, relationship, they, were, widespread, in, both, the, old, world, and, north, america, during, the, neogene, old, world, vultures, are, probably, a, polyphyletic, group, within, accipitridae, belonging, to, two, separate, not, closely, related, groups, within, the, family, most, authorities, refer, to, two, major, clades, gypaetinae, gypaetus, gypohierax, and, neophron, and, aegypiinae, aegypius, gyps, sarcogyps, torgos, trigonoceps, and, possibly, necrosyrtes, the, former, seem, to, be, nested, with, perninae, hawks, while, the, latter, are, closely, related, and, possibly, even, synonymous, with, aquilinae, within, aegypiinae, torgos, aegypius, sarcogyps, and, trigonoceps, are, particularly, closely, related, and, possibly, within, the, same, genus, despite, the, name, of, the, group, old, world, vultures, were, widespread, in, north, america, until, relatively, recently, until, the, end, of, the, late, pleistocene, epoch, around, 11, 000, years, ago, both, old, world, and, new, world, vultures, are, scavenging, birds, feeding, mostly, from, carcasses, of, dead, animals, old, world, vultures, find, carcasses, exclusively, by, sight, a, particular, characteristic, of, many, vultures, is, a, semi, bald, head, sometimes, without, feathers, or, with, just, simple, down, historically, it, was, thought, that, this, was, due, to, feeding, habits, as, feathers, would, be, glued, with, decaying, flesh, and, blood, however, more, recent, studies, have, shown, that, it, is, actually, a, thermoregulatory, adaptation, to, avoid, facial, overheating, the, presence, or, absence, of, complex, feathers, seems, to, matter, little, in, feeding, habits, as, some, vultures, are, quite, raptorial, extinct, more, than, half, of, the, old, world, vulture, species, are, listed, as, vulnerable, endangered, or, critically, endangered, by, the, iucn, red, list, population, declines, are, caused, by, a, variety, of, threats, that, vary, by, species, and, region, with, most, notable, declines, in, asia, due, to, diclofenac, use, within, africa, a, combination, of, poisonings, and, vulture, trade, including, use, as, bushmeat, and, traditional, medicine, account, for, roughly, 90, of, the, population, declines, and, because, vultures, are, scavengers, their, population, decline, can, have, cultural, public, health, and, economic, implications, for, communities, and, be, even, more, problematic, than, the, decline, of, other, endangered, species, vulture, populations, are, particularly, vulnerable, because, they, typically, feed, in, large, groups, and, easily, fall, victim, to, mass, poisoning, events, diclofenac, poisoning, has, caused, the, vulture, population, in, india, and, pakistan, to, decline, by, up, to, 99, and, two, or, three, species, of, vulture, in, south, asia, are, nearing, extinction, this, has, been, caused, by, the, practice, of, medicating, working, farm, animals, with, diclofenac, which, is, a, non, steroidal, anti, inflammatory, drug, nsaid, with, anti, inflammatory, and, pain, killing, actions, diclofenac, administration, keeps, animals, that, are, ill, or, in, pain, working, on, the, land, for, longer, but, if, the, ill, animals, die, their, carcasses, contain, diclofenac, farmers, leave, the, dead, animals, out, in, the, open, relying, on, vultures, to, tidy, up, diclofenac, present, in, carcass, flesh, is, eaten, by, vultures, which, are, sensitive, to, diclofenac, and, they, suffer, kidney, failure, visceral, gout, and, death, as, a, result, of, diclofenac, poisoning, the, drug, is, poisonous, enough, that, only, a, small, amount, of, animal, carcases, need, to, contain, it, to, have, detrimental, effects, on, vulture, populations, meloxicam, another, nsaid, has, been, found, to, be, harmless, to, vultures, and, should, prove, an, acceptable, alternative, to, diclofenac, bans, on, diclofenac, in, veterinary, practices, have, been, implemented, in, pakistan, and, nepal, and, selling, or, using, the, drug, in, india, can, result, in, jail, time, but, while, the, government, of, india, banned, diclofenac, over, a, year, later, in, 2007, it, continued, to, be, sold, and, remains, a, problem, in, other, parts, of, the, world, poisoning, accounts, for, a, majority, of, vulture, deaths, in, africa, ivory, poachers, poison, carcasses, with, the, intent, of, killing, vultures, since, vultures, circling, over, a, carcass, alert, authorities, to, a, kill, an, increase, in, demand, for, ivory, has, both, increased, the, rate, of, elephant, poachings, as, well, as, increased, the, rate, at, which, vultures, are, killed, off, by, consuming, the, poisoned, elephant, remains, in, kruger, national, park, white, backed, vultures, will, be, eradicated, in, the, next, 60, years, if, poisoned, carcasses, are, not, detected, and, neutralized, eliminating, carcass, poisoning, is, challenging, because, it, is, far, easier, to, carry, out, than, to, regulate, park, officials, often, lack, the, training, to, identify, toxic, chemicals, before, it, is, too, late, and, calling, on, average, community, members, to, turn, in, perpetrators, reports, is, challenging, if, financial, incentives, to, do, so, are, insufficient, vultures, are, also, unintentionally, poisoned, when, they, consume, carcasses, of, predators, that, have, been, poisoned, by, livestock, farmers, for, those, who, rely, on, livestock, to, make, a, living, illegal, pesticides, are, often, used, on, fruits, meats, or, even, the, water, in, a, wateringhole, in, order, to, eliminate, large, predators, that, threaten, their, livestock, agricultural, poisoning, is, relatively, easy, as, it, does, not, require, specific, skills, and, the, poison, is, cheap, with, a, long, shelf, life, vultures, in, africa, are, killed, for, use, in, traditional, medicine, as, part, of, the, african, vulture, trade, vultures, can, be, targeted, for, the, industry, directly, or, collected, from, other, poisoning, events, but, close, to, 30, of, vulture, deaths, recorded, in, africa, can, be, tied, back, to, belief, based, use, in, south, africa, vulture, consumption, events, have, been, estimated, to, occur, 59, 000, times, a, year, vulture, heads, are, believed, to, provide, clairvoyance, or, good, luck, like, winning, the, lottery, the, length, of, time, a, vulture, can, be, used, by, healers, is, dependent, on, size, and, species, some, healers, have, been, recorded, using, cape, vultures, for, 6, years, because, they, are, said, to, last, longer, than, other, species, others, use, 1, 2, individuals, a, year, but, this, rate, is, unsustainable, given, the, estimated, number, of, healers, in, southern, africa, traditional, medicine, is, called, muthi, for, some, healers, it, is, believed, to, cure, illnesses, while, others, believe, it, cures, curses, vulture, muthi, involves, separate, body, parts, being, dried, burned, or, ground, up, the, results, may, be, consumed, by, mixing, with, food, drinking, snorting, or, applying, to, cuts, some, healers, look, for, signs, of, poisoning, when, purchasing, vultures, but, others, are, unaware, of, how, to, do, this, and, are, at, risk, of, poisoning, their, clients, another, part, of, the, african, vulture, trade, is, use, for, bushmeat, consumption, collisions, with, electrical, infrastructure, account, for, roughly, 9, of, vulture, deaths, in, africa, some, organizations, in, south, africa, are, working, with, power, companies, to, mitigate, this, threat, as, vultures, play, an, important, role, in, ecosystems, their, population, decline, can, have, cultural, public, health, and, economic, implications, for, communities, the, decline, in, vultures, has, led, to, hygiene, problems, in, india, as, carcasses, of, dead, animals, now, tend, to, rot, or, be, eaten, by, rats, or, feral, dogs, rather, than, be, consumed, by, vultures, rabies, among, these, other, scavengers, is, a, major, health, threat, india, has, one, of, the, world, s, highest, incidences, of, rabies, for, communities, such, as, the, parsi, who, practice, sky, burials, in, which, human, corpses, are, put, on, the, top, of, a, tower, of, silence, vulture, population, declines, can, have, serious, cultural, implications, conservation, efforts, would, be, most, effective, in, large, protected, areas, because, vultures, are, most, populous, in, those, small, but, frequent, poisoning, events, have, a, more, detrimental, effect, on, vulture, populations, than, larger, infrequent, events, because, population, recovery, is, more, successful, when, there, is, a, longer, time, between, poisonings, to, increase, populations, vultures, can, be, reintroduced, to, poison, free, protected, areas, near, other, groups, of, vultures, to, keep, the, populations, high, this, will, make, it, easier, for, vultures, to, maintain, some, individuals, after, a, poisoning, event, a, project, named, vulture, restaurant, is, underway, in, nepal, in, an, effort, to, conserve, the, dwindling, number, of, vultures, the, restaurant, is, an, open, grassy, area, where, naturally, dying, sick, and, old, cows, are, fed, to, the, vultures, organizations, across, africa, are, working, to, reduce, threats, to, vulture, species, with, efforts, to, change, and, create, policies, to, protect, species, both, at, the, national, and, international, scale, proposed, strategies, to, reduce, poisoning, events, include, mobile, phone, numbers, to, report, offenders, campaigns, to, educate, about, poisoning, risks, to, humans, and, improving, response, speed, to, poisoning, events, poison, response, training, would, be, an, important, implementation, in, conservation, efforts, because, this, is, one, of, the, most, prevalent, threats, to, vulture, populations
