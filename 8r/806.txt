see, text, sus, s, u, s, is, the, genus, of, wild, and, domestic, pigs, within, the, even, toed, ungulate, family, suidae, sus, include, domestic, pigs, sus, domesticus, and, their, ancestor, the, common, eurasian, wild, boar, sus, scrofa, along, with, other, species, sus, species, like, all, suids, are, native, to, the, eurasian, and, african, continents, ranging, from, europe, to, the, pacific, islands, suids, other, than, the, pig, are, the, babirusa, of, indonesia, the, pygmy, hog, of, south, asia, the, warthogs, of, africa, and, other, pig, genera, from, africa, the, suids, are, a, sister, clade, to, peccaries, juvenile, pigs, are, known, as, piglets, pigs, live, in, complex, social, groups, and, are, considered, one, of, the, more, intelligent, mammals, as, reflected, in, their, ability, to, learn, with, around, 1, billion, of, this, species, alive, at, any, time, the, domestic, pig, is, among, the, most, populous, large, mammals, in, the, world, pigs, are, omnivores, and, can, consume, a, wide, range, of, food, pigs, are, biologically, similar, to, humans, and, are, thus, frequently, used, for, human, medical, research, the, online, etymology, dictionary, provides, anecdotal, evidence, as, well, as, linguistic, saying, that, the, term, derives, probably, from, old, english, picg, found, in, compounds, ultimate, origin, unknown, originally, young, pig, the, word, for, adults, was, swine, apparently, related, to, low, german, bigge, dutch, big, but, the, phonology, is, difficult, oed, another, old, english, word, for, pig, was, fearh, related, to, furh, furrow, from, pie, perk, dig, furrow, source, also, of, latin, porc, us, pig, see, pork, this, reflects, a, widespread, ie, tendency, to, name, animals, from, typical, attributes, or, activities, synonyms, grunter, oinker, are, from, sailors, and, fishermen, s, euphemistic, avoidance, of, uttering, the, word, pig, at, sea, a, superstition, perhaps, based, on, the, fate, of, the, gadarene, swine, who, drowned, the, online, etymology, dictionary, also, traces, the, evolution, of, sow, the, term, for, a, female, pig, through, various, historical, languages, old, english, sugu,

swine, old, irish, socc, snout, plowshare, possibly, imitative, of, pig, noise, note, that, sanskrit, sukharah, means, maker, of, the, sound, su, an, adjectival, form, is, porcine, another, adjectival, form, technically, for, the, subfamily, rather, than, genus, name, is, suine, comparable, to, bovine, canine, etc, for, the, family, it, is, suid, as, with, bovid, canid, a, typical, pig, has, a, large, head, with, a, long, snout, that, is, strengthened, by, a, special, prenasal, bone, and, by, a, disk, of, cartilage, at, the, tip, the, snout, is, used, to, dig, into, the, soil, to, find, food, and, is, a, very, acute, sense, organ, each, foot, has, four, hooves, with, the, two, larger, central, toes, bearing, most, of, the, weight, and, the, outer, two, also, being, used, in, soft, ground, the, dental, formula, of, adult, pigs, is, 3, 1, 4, 3, 3, 1, 4, 3, giving, a, total, of, 44, teeth, the, rear, teeth, are, adapted, for, crushing, in, the, male, the, canine, teeth, form, tusks, which, grow, continuously, and, are, sharpened, by, constantly, being, ground, against, each, other, occasionally, captive, mother, pigs, may, savage, their, own, piglets, often, if, they, become, severely, stressed, some, attacks, on, newborn, piglets, are, non, fatal, others, may, kill, the, piglets, and, sometimes, the, mother, may, eat, them, an, estimated, 50, of, piglet, fatalities, are, due, to, the, mother, attacking, or, unintentionally, crushing, the, newborn, pre, weaned, animals, with, around, 1, billion, individuals, alive, at, any, time, the, domestic, pig, is, one, of, the, most, numerous, large, mammals, on, the, planet, the, ancestor, of, the, domestic, pig, is, the, wild, boar, which, is, one, of, the, most, numerous, and, widespread, large, mammals, its, many, subspecies, are, native, to, all, but, the, harshest, climates, of, continental, eurasia, and, its, islands, and, africa, as, well, from, ireland, and, india, to, japan, and, north, to, siberia, long, isolated, from, other, pigs, on, the, many, islands, of, indonesia, malaysia, and, the, philippines, pigs, have, evolved, into, many, different, species, including, wild, boar, bearded, pigs, and, warty, pigs, humans, have, introduced, pigs, into, australia, north, and, south, america, and, numerous, islands, either, accidentally, as, escaped, domestic, pigs, which, have, gone, feral, or, as, wild, boar, the, wild, boar, sus, scrofa, can, take, advantage, of, any, forage, resources, therefore, they, can, live, in, virtually, any, productive, habitat, that, can, provide, enough, water, to, sustain, large, mammals, such, as, pigs, pigs, are, famously, fecund, when, well, fed, a, sow, can, birth, twelve, or, more, piglets, in, her, annual, litter, if, there, is, increased, foraging, by, wild, boars, in, certain, areas, they, can, cause, a, nutritional, shortage, which, can, cause, the, pig, population, to, decrease, if, the, nutritional, state, returns, to, normal, the, pig, population, will, most, likely, rise, due, to, the, pigs, naturally, increased, reproduction, rate, pigs, are, omnivores, which, means, that, they, consume, both, plants, and, animals, in, the, wild, they, are, foragers, searching, through, their, habitat, for, food, which, for, pigs, often, includes, digging, with, their, snouts, wild, pigs, eat, roots, tubers, leaves, fruits, mushrooms, and, flowers, in, addition, to, some, insects, especially, insect, grubs, and, fish, pigs, are, famously, fond, of, truffle, mushrooms, which, grow, underground, pigs, find, them, by, scent, and, unearth, them, with, their, snouts, in, europe, trained, truffle, pigs, find, these, valuable, fungi, for, humans, pigs, do, not, hunt, but, will, readily, eat, carrion, eggs, and, other, animal, foods, that, they, can, find, as, livestock, pigs, were, once, fed, all, manner, of, mixed, household, food, scraps, called, slops, but, on, large, modern, farms, are, now, fed, mostly, corn, and, soybean, meal, with, a, mixture, of, vitamins, and, minerals, added, traditionally, pigs, were, raised, on, dairy, farms, and, fed, any, excess, milk, and, the, whey, left, over, from, cheese, and, butter, making, pigs, brought, so, much, extra, income, to, these, farms, that, they, earned, the, nickname, mortgage, lifters, older, pigs, will, consume, three, to, five, gallons, of, water, per, day, when, kept, as, pets, the, optimal, healthy, diet, consists, mainly, of, a, balanced, diet, of, raw, vegetables, although, some, may, give, their, pigs, commercial, mini, pig, pellet, feed, most, pigs, today, are, domesticated, pigs, raised, for, meat, known, as, pork, miniature, breeds, are, commonly, kept, as, pets, because, of, their, foraging, abilities, and, excellent, sense, of, smell, people, in, many, european, countries, use, them, to, find, truffles, both, wild, and, feral, pigs, are, commonly, hunted, apart, from, meat, pig, skin, is, turned, into, leather, and, their, hairs, are, used, to, make, brushes, the, relatively, short, stiff, coarse, pig, hairs, are, called, bristles, and, were, once, so, commonly, used, in, paintbrushes, that, in, 1946, the, australian, government, launched, operation, pig, bristle, in, may, 1946, in, response, to, a, shortage, of, pig, bristles, for, paintbrushes, to, paint, houses, in, the, post, world, war, ii, construction, boom, the, royal, australian, air, force, raaf, flew, in, 28, short, tons, of, pig, bristles, from, china, their, only, commercially, available, source, at, the, time, human, skin, is, very, similar, to, pig, skin, therefore, many, preclinical, studies, employ, pig, skin, in, addition, to, providing, use, in, biomedical, research, and, for, drug, testing, genetic, advances, in, human, healthcare, have, provided, a, pathway, for, domestic, pigs, to, become, xenotransplantation, candidates, for, humans, the, genus, sus, is, currently, thought, to, contain, nine, living, species, several, extinct, species, are, known, from, fossils, pigs, have, been, domesticated, since, ancient, times, in, the, old, world, pigs, were, domesticated, on, each, end, of, eurasia, and, possibly, several, times, it, is, now, thought, that, pigs, were, attracted, to, human, settlements, for, the, food, scraps, and, that, the, process, of, domestication, began, as, a, commensal, relationship, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, pigs, were, being, managed, in, the, wild, in, a, way, similar, to, the, way, they, are, managed, by, some, modern, new, guineans, from, wild, boar, as, early, as, 13, 000, 12, 700, bp, in, the, near, east, in, the, tigris, basin, ay, n, cafer, h, y, k, neval, ori, remains, of, pigs, have, been, dated, to, earlier, than, 11, 400, bp, in, cyprus, that, must, have, been, introduced, from, the, mainland, which, suggests, domestication, in, the, adjacent, mainland, by, then, pigs, were, also, domesticated, in, china, potentially, more, than, once, in, some, parts, of, china, pigs, were, kept, in, pens, from, early, times, separating, them, from, wild, populations, and, allowing, farmers, to, create, breeds, that, were, fatter, and, bred, more, quickly, early, modern, europeans, brought, these, breeds, back, home, and, crossed, them, with, their, own, pigs, which, was, the, origins, of, most, modern, pig, breeds, in, india, pigs, have, been, domesticated, for, a, long, time, mostly, in, goa, and, some, rural, areas, for, pig, toilets, this, practice, also, occurred, in, china, though, ecologically, logical, as, well, as, economical, pig, toilets, are, waning, in, popularity, as, use, of, septic, tanks, and, or, sewerage, systems, is, increasing, in, rural, areas, hernando, de, soto, and, other, early, spanish, explorers, brought, pigs, to, southeastern, north, america, from, europe, as, in, medieval, europe, pigs, are, valued, on, certain, oceanic, islands, for, their, self, sufficiency, which, allows, them, to, be, turned, loose, although, the, practice, does, have, drawbacks, see, environmental, impact, the, domestic, pig, sus, domesticus, is, usually, given, the, scientific, name, sus, scrofa, domesticus, although, some, taxonomists, including, the, american, society, of, mammalogists, call, it, s, domesticus, reserving, s, scrofa, for, the, wild, boar, it, was, domesticated, approximately, 5, 000, to, 7, 000, years, ago, the, upper, canines, form, sharp, distinctive, tusks, that, curve, outward, and, upward, compared, to, other, artiodactyles, their, head, is, relatively, long, pointed, and, free, of, warts, their, head, and, body, length, ranges, from, 0, 9, to, 1, 8, m, 35, to, 71, in, and, they, can, weigh, between, 50, and, 350, kg, 110, and, 770, lb, in, november, 2012, scientists, managed, to, sequence, the, genome, of, the, domestic, pig, the, similarities, between, the, pig, and, human, genomes, mean, that, the, new, data, may, have, wide, applications, in, the, study, and, treatment, of, human, genetic, diseases, in, august, 2015, a, study, looked, at, over, 100, pig, genome, sequences, to, ascertain, their, process, of, domestication, the, process, of, domestication, was, assumed, to, have, been, initiated, by, humans, involved, few, individuals, and, relied, on, reproductive, isolation, between, wild, and, domestic, forms, the, study, found, that, the, assumption, of, reproductive, isolation, with, population, bottlenecks, was, not, supported, the, study, indicated, that, pigs, were, domesticated, separately, in, western, asia, and, china, with, western, asian, pigs, introduced, into, europe, where, they, crossed, with, wild, boar, a, model, that, fitted, the, data, included, admixture, with, a, now, extinct, ghost, population, of, wild, pigs, during, the, pleistocene, the, study, also, found, that, despite, back, crossing, with, wild, pigs, the, genomes, of, domestic, pigs, have, strong, signatures, of, selection, at, dna, loci, that, affect, behavior, and, morphology, the, study, concluded, that, human, selection, for, domestic, traits, likely, counteracted, the, homogenizing, effect, of, gene, flow, from, wild, boars, and, created, domestication, islands, in, the, genome, the, same, process, may, also, apply, to, other, domesticated, animals, pigs, have, been, important, in, culture, across, the, world, since, neolithic, times, they, appear, in, art, literature, and, religion, in, asia, the, wild, boar, is, one, of, 12, animal, images, comprising, the, chinese, zodiac, while, in, europe, the, boar, represents, a, standard, charge, in, heraldry, in, islam, and, judaism, pigs, and, those, who, handle, them, are, viewed, negatively, and, the, consumption, of, pork, is, forbidden, pigs, are, alluded, to, in, animal, epithets, and, proverbs, the, pig, has, been, celebrated, throughout, europe, since, ancient, times, in, its, carnivals, the, name, coming, from, the, italian, carne, levare, the, lifting, of, meat, pigs, have, been, brought, into, literature, for, varying, reasons, ranging, from, the, pleasures, of, eating, as, in, charles, lamb, s, a, dissertation, upon, roast, pig, to, william, golding, s, lord, of, the, flies, with, the, fat, character, piggy, where, the, rotting, boar, s, head, on, a, stick, represents, beelzebub, lord, of, the, flies, being, the, direct, translation, of, the, hebrew, and, george, orwell, s, allegorical, novel, animal, farm, where, the, central, characters, representing, soviet, leaders, are, all, pigs, domestic, pigs, that, have, escaped, from, urban, areas, or, were, allowed, to, forage, in, the, wild, and, in, some, cases, wild, boars, which, were, introduced, as, prey, for, hunting, have, given, rise, to, large, populations, of, feral, pigs, in, north, and, south, america, australia, new, zealand, hawaii, and, other, areas, where, pigs, are, not, native, accidental, or, deliberate, releases, of, pigs, into, countries, or, environments, where, they, are, an, alien, species, have, caused, extensive, environmental, change, their, omnivorous, diet, aggressive, behaviour, and, their, feeding, method, of, rooting, in, the, ground, all, combine, to, severely, alter, ecosystems, unused, to, pigs, pigs, will, even, eat, small, animals, and, destroy, nests, of, ground, nesting, birds, the, invasive, species, specialist, group, lists, feral, pigs, on, the, list, of, the, world, s, 100, worst, invasive, species, and, says, feral, pigs, like, other, introduced, mammals, are, major, drivers, of, extinction, and, ecosystem, change, they, have, been, introduced, into, many, parts, of, the, world, and, will, damage, crops, and, home, gardens, as, well, as, potentially, spreading, disease, they, uproot, large, areas, of, land, eliminating, native, vegetation, and, spreading, weeds, this, results, in, habitat, alteration, a, change, in, plant, succession, and, composition, and, a, decrease, in, native, fauna, dependent, on, the, original, habitat, because, of, their, biological, similarities, pigs, can, harbour, a, range, of, parasites, and, diseases, that, can, be, transmitted, to, humans, examples, of, such, zoonoses, include, trichinosis, taenia, solium, cysticercosis, and, brucellosis, pigs, also, host, large, concentrations, of, parasitic, ascarid, worms, in, their, digestive, tracts, some, strains, of, influenza, are, endemic, in, pigs, the, most, significant, of, which, are, h1n1, h1n2, and, h3n2, the, first, of, which, has, caused, several, outbreaks, among, humans, including, the, spanish, flu, 1977, russian, flu, pandemic, and, the, 2009, swine, flu, pandemic, pigs, also, can, acquire, human, influenza
