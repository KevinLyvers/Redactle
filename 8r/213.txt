photosynthesis, f, o, t, s, n, s, s, foh, t, sinth, sis, is, a, system, of, biological, processes, by, which, photosynthetic, organisms, such, as, most, plants, algae, and, cyanobacteria, convert, light, energy, typically, from, sunlight, into, the, chemical, energy, necessary, to, fuel, their, metabolism, photosynthesis, usually, refers, to, oxygenic, photosynthesis, a, process, that, produces, oxygen, photosynthetic, organisms, store, the, chemical, energy, so, produced, within, intracellular, organic, compounds, compounds, containing, carbon, like, sugars, glycogen, cellulose, and, starches, to, use, this, stored, chemical, energy, an, organism, s, cells, metabolize, the, organic, compounds, through, cellular, respiration, photosynthesis, plays, a, critical, role, in, producing, and, maintaining, the, oxygen, content, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, and, it, supplies, most, of, the, biological, energy, necessary, for, complex, life, on, earth, some, bacteria, also, perform, anoxygenic, photosynthesis, which, uses, bacteriochlorophyll, to, split, hydrogen, sulfide, as, a, reductant, instead, of, water, producing, sulfur, instead, of, oxygen, archaea, such, as, halobacterium, also, perform, a, type, of, non, carbon, fixing, anoxygenic, photosynthesis, where, the, simpler, photopigment, retinal, and, its, microbial, rhodopsin, derivatives, are, used, to, absorb, green, light, and, power, proton, pumps, to, directly, synthesize, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, the, energy, currency, of, cells, such, archaeal, photosynthesis, might, have, been, the, earliest, form, of, photosynthesis, that, evolved, on, earth, as, far, back, as, the, paleoarchean, preceding, that, of, cyanobacteria, see, purple, earth, hypothesis, while, the, details, may, differ, between, species, the, process, always, begins, when, light, energy, is, absorbed, by, the, reaction, centers, proteins, that, contain, photosynthetic, pigments, or, chromophores, in, plants, these, proteins, are, chlorophylls, a, porphyrin, derivative, that, absorbs, the, red, and, blue, spectrums, of, light, thus, reflecting, green, held, inside, chloroplasts, abundant, in, leaf, cells, in, bacteria, they, are, embedded, in, the, plasma, membrane, in, these, light, dependent, reactions, some, energy, is, used, to, strip, electrons, from, suitable, substances, such, as, water, producing, oxygen, gas, the, hydrogen, freed, by, the, splitting, of, water, is, used, in, the, creation, of, two, important, molecules, that, participate, in, energetic, processes, reduced, nicotinamide, adenine, dinucleotide, phosphate, nadph, and, atp, in, plants, algae, and, cyanobacteria, sugars, are, synthesized, by, a, subsequent, sequence, of, light, independent, reactions, called, the, calvin, cycle, in, this, process, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, is, incorporated, into, already, existing, organic, compounds, such, as, ribulose, bisphosphate, rubp, using, the, atp, and, nadph, produced, by, the, light, dependent, reactions, the, resulting, compounds, are, then, reduced, and, removed, to, form, further, carbohydrates, such, as, glucose, in, other, bacteria, different, mechanisms, like, the, reverse, krebs, cycle, are, used, to, achieve, the, same, end, the, first, photosynthetic, organisms, probably, evolved, early, in, the, evolutionary, history, of, life, using, reducing, agents, such, as, hydrogen, or, hydrogen, sulfide, rather, than, water, as, sources, of, electrons, cyanobacteria, appeared, later, the, excess, oxygen, they, produced, contributed, directly, to, the, oxygenation, of, the, earth, which, rendered, the, evolution, of, complex, life, possible, the, average, rate, of, energy, captured, by, global, photosynthesis, is, approximately, 130, terawatts, which, is, about, eight, times, the, total, power, consumption, of, human, civilization, photosynthetic, organisms, also, convert, around, 100, 115, billion, tons, 91, 104, pg, petagrams, or, a, billion, metric, tons, of, carbon, into, biomass, per, year, photosynthesis, was, discovered, in, 1779, by, jan, ingenhousz, he, showed, that, plants, need, light, not, just, air, soil, and, water, photosynthesis, is, vital, for, climate, processes, as, it, captures, carbon, dioxide, from, the, air, and, binds, it, into, plants, harvested, produce, and, soil, cereals, alone, are, estimated, to, bind, 3, 825, tg, or, 3, 825, pg, of, carbon, dioxide, every, year, i, e, 3, 825, billion, metric, tons, most, photosynthetic, organisms, are, photoautotrophs, which, means, that, they, are, able, to, synthesize, food, directly, from, carbon, dioxide, and, water, using, energy, from, light, however, not, all, organisms, use, carbon, dioxide, as, a, source, of, carbon, atoms, to, carry, out, photosynthesis, photoheterotrophs, use, organic, compounds, rather, than, carbon, dioxide, as, a, source, of, carbon, in, plants, algae, and, cyanobacteria, photosynthesis, releases, oxygen, this, oxygenic, photosynthesis, is, by, far, the, most, common, type, of, photosynthesis, used, by, living, organisms, some, shade, loving, plants, sciophytes, produce, such, low, levels, of, oxygen, during, photosynthesis, that, they, use, all, of, it, themselves, instead, of, releasing, it, to, the, atmosphere, although, there, are, some, differences, between, oxygenic, photosynthesis, in, plants, algae, and, cyanobacteria, the, overall, process, is, quite, similar, in, these, organisms, there, are, also, many, varieties, of, anoxygenic, photosynthesis, used, mostly, by, bacteria, which, consume, carbon, dioxide, but, do, not, release, oxygen, carbon, dioxide, is, converted, into, sugars, in, a, process, called, carbon, fixation, photosynthesis, captures, energy, from, sunlight, to, convert, carbon, dioxide, into, carbohydrates, carbon, fixation, is, an, endothermic, redox, reaction, in, general, outline, photosynthesis, is, the, opposite, of, cellular, respiration, while, photosynthesis, is, a, process, of, reduction, of, carbon, dioxide, to, carbohydrates, cellular, respiration, is, the, oxidation, of, carbohydrates, or, other, nutrients, to, carbon, dioxide, nutrients, used, in, cellular, respiration, include, carbohydrates, amino, acids, and, fatty, acids, these, nutrients, are, oxidized, to, produce, carbon, dioxide, and, water, and, to, release, chemical, energy, to, drive, the, organism, s, metabolism, photosynthesis, and, cellular, respiration, are, distinct, processes, as, they, take, place, through, different, sequences, of, chemical, reactions, and, in, different, cellular, compartments, cellular, respiration, in, mitochondria, the, general, equation, for, photosynthesis, as, first, proposed, by, cornelis, van, niel, is, since, water, is, used, as, the, electron, donor, in, oxygenic, photosynthesis, the, equation, for, this, process, is, this, equation, emphasizes, that, water, is, both, a, reactant, in, the, light, dependent, reaction, and, a, product, of, the, light, independent, reaction, but, canceling, n, water, molecules, from, each, side, gives, the, net, equation, other, processes, substitute, other, compounds, such, as, arsenite, for, water, in, the, electron, supply, role, for, example, some, microbes, use, sunlight, to, oxidize, arsenite, to, arsenate, the, equation, for, this, reaction, is, photosynthesis, occurs, in, two, stages, in, the, first, stage, light, dependent, reactions, or, light, reactions, capture, the, energy, of, light, and, use, it, to, make, the, hydrogen, carrier, nadph, and, the, energy, storage, molecule, atp, during, the, second, stage, the, light, independent, reactions, use, these, products, to, capture, and, reduce, carbon, dioxide, most, organisms, that, use, oxygenic, photosynthesis, use, visible, light, for, the, light, dependent, reactions, although, at, least, three, use, shortwave, infrared, or, more, specifically, far, red, radiation, some, organisms, employ, even, more, radical, variants, of, photosynthesis, some, archaea, use, a, simpler, method, that, employs, a, pigment, similar, to, those, used, for, vision, in, animals, the, bacteriorhodopsin, changes, its, configuration, in, response, to, sunlight, acting, as, a, proton, pump, this, produces, a, proton, gradient, more, directly, which, is, then, converted, to, chemical, energy, the, process, does, not, involve, carbon, dioxide, fixation, and, does, not, release, oxygen, and, seems, to, have, evolved, separately, from, the, more, common, types, of, photosynthesis, in, photosynthetic, bacteria, the, proteins, that, gather, light, for, photosynthesis, are, embedded, in, cell, membranes, in, its, simplest, form, this, involves, the, membrane, surrounding, the, cell, itself, however, the, membrane, may, be, tightly, folded, into, cylindrical, sheets, called, thylakoids, or, bunched, up, into, round, vesicles, called, intracytoplasmic, membranes, these, structures, can, fill, most, of, the, interior, of, a, cell, giving, the, membrane, a, very, large, surface, area, and, therefore, increasing, the, amount, of, light, that, the, bacteria, can, absorb, in, plants, and, algae, photosynthesis, takes, place, in, organelles, called, chloroplasts, a, typical, plant, cell, contains, about, 10, to, 100, chloroplasts, the, chloroplast, is, enclosed, by, a, membrane, this, membrane, is, composed, of, a, phospholipid, inner, membrane, a, phospholipid, outer, membrane, and, an, intermembrane, space, enclosed, by, the, membrane, is, an, aqueous, fluid, called, the, stroma, embedded, within, the, stroma, are, stacks, of, thylakoids, grana, which, are, the, site, of, photosynthesis, the, thylakoids, appear, as, flattened, disks, the, thylakoid, itself, is, enclosed, by, the, thylakoid, membrane, and, within, the, enclosed, volume, is, a, lumen, or, thylakoid, space, embedded, in, the, thylakoid, membrane, are, integral, and, peripheral, membrane, protein, complexes, of, the, photosynthetic, system, plants, absorb, light, primarily, using, the, pigment, chlorophyll, the, green, part, of, the, light, spectrum, is, not, absorbed, but, is, reflected, which, is, the, reason, that, most, plants, have, a, green, color, besides, chlorophyll, plants, also, use, pigments, such, as, carotenes, and, xanthophylls, algae, also, use, chlorophyll, but, various, other, pigments, are, present, such, as, phycocyanin, carotenes, and, xanthophylls, in, green, algae, phycoerythrin, in, red, algae, rhodophytes, and, fucoxanthin, in, brown, algae, and, diatoms, resulting, in, a, wide, variety, of, colors, these, pigments, are, embedded, in, plants, and, algae, in, complexes, called, antenna, proteins, in, such, proteins, the, pigments, are, arranged, to, work, together, such, a, combination, of, proteins, is, also, called, a, light, harvesting, complex, although, all, cells, in, the, green, parts, of, a, plant, have, chloroplasts, the, majority, of, those, are, found, in, specially, adapted, structures, called, leaves, certain, species, adapted, to, conditions, of, strong, sunlight, and, aridity, such, as, many, euphorbia, and, cactus, species, have, their, main, photosynthetic, organs, in, their, stems, the, cells, in, the, interior, tissues, of, a, leaf, called, the, mesophyll, can, contain, between, 450, 000, and, 800, 000, chloroplasts, for, every, square, millimeter, of, leaf, the, surface, of, the, leaf, is, coated, with, a, water, resistant, waxy, cuticle, that, protects, the, leaf, from, excessive, evaporation, of, water, and, decreases, the, absorption, of, ultraviolet, or, blue, light, to, minimize, heating, the, transparent, epidermis, layer, allows, light, to, pass, through, to, the, palisade, mesophyll, cells, where, most, of, the, photosynthesis, takes, place, in, the, light, dependent, reactions, one, molecule, of, the, pigment, chlorophyll, absorbs, one, photon, and, loses, one, electron, this, electron, is, taken, up, by, a, modified, form, of, chlorophyll, called, pheophytin, which, passes, the, electron, to, a, quinone, molecule, starting, the, flow, of, electrons, down, an, electron, transport, chain, that, leads, to, the, ultimate, reduction, of, nadp, to, nadph, in, addition, this, creates, a, proton, gradient, energy, gradient, across, the, chloroplast, membrane, which, is, used, by, atp, synthase, in, the, synthesis, of, atp, the, chlorophyll, molecule, ultimately, regains, the, electron, it, lost, when, a, water, molecule, is, split, in, a, process, called, photolysis, which, releases, oxygen, the, overall, equation, for, the, light, dependent, reactions, under, the, conditions, of, non, cyclic, electron, flow, in, green, plants, is, not, all, wavelengths, of, light, can, support, photosynthesis, the, photosynthetic, action, spectrum, depends, on, the, type, of, accessory, pigments, present, for, example, in, green, plants, the, action, spectrum, resembles, the, absorption, spectrum, for, chlorophylls, and, carotenoids, with, absorption, peaks, in, violet, blue, and, red, light, in, red, algae, the, action, spectrum, is, blue, green, light, which, allows, these, algae, to, use, the, blue, end, of, the, spectrum, to, grow, in, the, deeper, waters, that, filter, out, the, longer, wavelengths, red, light, used, by, above, ground, green, plants, the, non, absorbed, part, of, the, light, spectrum, is, what, gives, photosynthetic, organisms, their, color, e, g, green, plants, red, algae, purple, bacteria, and, is, the, least, effective, for, photosynthesis, in, the, respective, organisms, in, plants, light, dependent, reactions, occur, in, the, thylakoid, membranes, of, the, chloroplasts, where, they, drive, the, synthesis, of, atp, and, nadph, the, light, dependent, reactions, are, of, two, forms, cyclic, and, non, cyclic, in, the, non, cyclic, reaction, the, photons, are, captured, in, the, light, harvesting, antenna, complexes, of, photosystem, ii, by, chlorophyll, and, other, accessory, pigments, see, diagram, at, right, the, absorption, of, a, photon, by, the, antenna, complex, loosens, an, electron, by, a, process, called, photoinduced, charge, separation, the, antenna, system, is, at, the, core, of, the, chlorophyll, molecule, of, the, photosystem, ii, reaction, center, that, loosened, electron, is, taken, up, by, the, primary, electron, acceptor, molecule, pheophytin, as, the, electrons, are, shuttled, through, an, electron, transport, chain, the, so, called, z, scheme, shown, in, the, diagram, a, chemiosmotic, potential, is, generated, by, pumping, proton, cations, h, across, the, membrane, and, into, the, thylakoid, space, an, atp, synthase, enzyme, uses, that, chemiosmotic, potential, to, make, atp, during, photophosphorylation, whereas, nadph, is, a, product, of, the, terminal, redox, reaction, in, the, z, scheme, the, electron, enters, a, chlorophyll, molecule, in, photosystem, i, there, it, is, further, excited, by, the, light, absorbed, by, that, photosystem, the, electron, is, then, passed, along, a, chain, of, electron, acceptors, to, which, it, transfers, some, of, its, energy, the, energy, delivered, to, the, electron, acceptors, is, used, to, move, hydrogen, ions, across, the, thylakoid, membrane, into, the, lumen, the, electron, is, eventually, used, to, reduce, the, coenzyme, nadp, with, an, h, to, nadph, which, has, functions, in, the, light, independent, reaction, at, that, point, the, path, of, that, electron, ends, the, cyclic, reaction, is, similar, to, that, of, the, non, cyclic, but, differs, in, that, it, generates, only, atp, and, no, reduced, nadp, nadph, is, created, the, cyclic, reaction, takes, place, only, at, photosystem, i, once, the, electron, is, displaced, from, the, photosystem, the, electron, is, passed, down, the, electron, acceptor, molecules, and, returns, to, photosystem, i, from, where, it, was, emitted, hence, the, name, cyclic, reaction, linear, electron, transport, through, a, photosystem, will, leave, the, reaction, center, of, that, photosystem, oxidized, elevating, another, electron, will, first, require, re, reduction, of, the, reaction, center, the, excited, electrons, lost, from, the, reaction, center, p700, of, photosystem, i, are, replaced, by, transfer, from, plastocyanin, whose, electrons, come, from, electron, transport, through, photosystem, ii, photosystem, ii, as, the, first, step, of, the, z, scheme, requires, an, external, source, of, electrons, to, reduce, its, oxidized, chlorophyll, a, reaction, center, the, source, of, electrons, for, photosynthesis, in, green, plants, and, cyanobacteria, is, water, two, water, molecules, are, oxidized, by, the, energy, of, four, successive, charge, separation, reactions, of, photosystem, ii, to, yield, a, molecule, of, diatomic, oxygen, and, four, hydrogen, ions, the, electrons, yielded, are, transferred, to, a, redox, active, tyrosine, residue, that, is, oxidized, by, the, energy, of, p680, this, resets, the, ability, of, p680, to, absorb, another, photon, and, release, another, photo, dissociated, electron, the, oxidation, of, water, is, catalyzed, in, photosystem, ii, by, a, redox, active, structure, that, contains, four, manganese, ions, and, a, calcium, ion, this, oxygen, evolving, complex, binds, two, water, molecules, and, contains, the, four, oxidizing, equivalents, that, are, used, to, drive, the, water, oxidizing, reaction, kok, s, s, state, diagrams, the, hydrogen, ions, are, released, in, the, thylakoid, lumen, and, therefore, contribute, to, the, transmembrane, chemiosmotic, potential, that, leads, to, atp, synthesis, oxygen, is, a, waste, product, of, light, dependent, reactions, but, the, majority, of, organisms, on, earth, use, oxygen, and, its, energy, for, cellular, respiration, including, photosynthetic, organisms, in, the, light, independent, or, dark, reactions, the, enzyme, rubisco, captures, co, 2, from, the, atmosphere, and, in, a, process, called, the, calvin, cycle, uses, the, newly, formed, nadph, and, releases, three, carbon, sugars, which, are, later, combined, to, form, sucrose, and, starch, the, overall, equation, for, the, light, independent, reactions, in, green, plants, is, 128, carbon, fixation, produces, the, three, carbon, sugar, intermediate, which, is, then, converted, into, the, final, carbohydrate, products, the, simple, carbon, sugars, photosynthesis, produces, are, then, used, to, form, other, organic, compounds, such, as, the, building, material, cellulose, the, precursors, for, lipid, and, amino, acid, biosynthesis, or, as, a, fuel, in, cellular, respiration, the, latter, occurs, not, only, in, plants, but, also, in, animals, when, the, carbon, and, energy, from, plants, is, passed, through, a, food, chain, the, fixation, or, reduction, of, carbon, dioxide, is, a, process, in, which, carbon, dioxide, combines, with, a, five, carbon, sugar, ribulose, 1, 5, bisphosphate, to, yield, two, molecules, of, a, three, carbon, compound, glycerate, 3, phosphate, also, known, as, 3, phosphoglycerate, glycerate, 3, phosphate, in, the, presence, of, atp, and, nadph, produced, during, the, light, dependent, stages, is, reduced, to, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, this, product, is, also, referred, to, as, 3, phosphoglyceraldehyde, pgal, or, more, generically, as, triose, phosphate, most, five, out, of, six, molecules, of, the, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, produced, are, used, to, regenerate, ribulose, 1, 5, bisphosphate, so, the, process, can, continue, the, triose, phosphates, not, thus, recycled, often, condense, to, form, hexose, phosphates, which, ultimately, yield, sucrose, starch, and, cellulose, as, well, as, glucose, and, fructose, the, sugars, produced, during, carbon, metabolism, yield, carbon, skeletons, that, can, be, used, for, other, metabolic, reactions, like, the, production, of, amino, acids, and, lipids, in, hot, and, dry, conditions, plants, close, their, stomata, to, prevent, water, loss, under, these, conditions, co, 2, will, decrease, and, oxygen, gas, produced, by, the, light, reactions, of, photosynthesis, will, increase, causing, an, increase, of, photorespiration, by, the, oxygenase, activity, of, ribulose, 1, 5, bisphosphate, carboxylase, oxygenase, rubisco, and, decrease, in, carbon, fixation, some, plants, have, evolved, mechanisms, to, increase, the, co, 2, concentration, in, the, leaves, under, these, conditions, plants, that, use, the, c, 4, carbon, fixation, process, chemically, fix, carbon, dioxide, in, the, cells, of, the, mesophyll, by, adding, it, to, the, three, carbon, molecule, phosphoenolpyruvate, pep, a, reaction, catalyzed, by, an, enzyme, called, pep, carboxylase, creating, the, four, carbon, organic, acid, oxaloacetic, acid, oxaloacetic, acid, or, malate, synthesized, by, this, process, is, then, translocated, to, specialized, bundle, sheath, cells, where, the, enzyme, rubisco, and, other, calvin, cycle, enzymes, are, located, and, where, co, 2, released, by, decarboxylation, of, the, four, carbon, acids, is, then, fixed, by, rubisco, activity, to, the, three, carbon, 3, phosphoglyceric, acids, the, physical, separation, of, rubisco, from, the, oxygen, generating, light, reactions, reduces, photorespiration, and, increases, co, 2, fixation, and, thus, the, photosynthetic, capacity, of, the, leaf, c, 4, plants, can, produce, more, sugar, than, c, 3, plants, in, conditions, of, high, light, and, temperature, many, important, crop, plants, are, c, 4, plants, including, maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and, millet, plants, that, do, not, use, pep, carboxylase, in, carbon, fixation, are, called, c, 3, plants, because, the, primary, carboxylation, reaction, catalyzed, by, rubisco, produces, the, three, carbon, 3, phosphoglyceric, acids, directly, in, the, calvin, benson, cycle, over, 90, of, plants, use, c, 3, carbon, fixation, compared, to, 3, that, use, c, 4, carbon, fixation, however, the, evolution, of, c, 4, in, over, sixty, plant, lineages, makes, it, a, striking, example, of, convergent, evolution, c, 2, photosynthesis, which, involves, carbon, concentration, by, selective, breakdown, of, photorespiratory, glycine, is, both, an, evolutionary, precursor, to, c, 4, and, a, useful, carbon, concentrating, mechanism, in, its, own, right, xerophytes, such, as, cacti, and, most, succulents, also, use, pep, carboxylase, to, capture, carbon, dioxide, in, a, process, called, crassulacean, acid, metabolism, cam, in, contrast, to, c, 4, metabolism, which, spatially, separates, the, co, 2, fixation, to, pep, from, the, calvin, cycle, cam, temporally, separates, these, two, processes, cam, plants, have, a, different, leaf, anatomy, from, c, 3, plants, and, fix, the, co, 2, at, night, when, their, stomata, are, open, cam, plants, store, the, co, 2, mostly, in, the, form, of, malic, acid, via, carboxylation, of, phosphoenolpyruvate, to, oxaloacetate, which, is, then, reduced, to, malate, decarboxylation, of, malate, during, the, day, releases, co, 2, inside, the, leaves, thus, allowing, carbon, fixation, to, 3, phosphoglycerate, by, rubisco, cam, is, used, by, 16, 000, species, of, plants, calcium, oxalate, accumulating, plants, such, as, amaranthus, hybridus, and, colobanthus, quitensis, show, a, variation, of, photosynthesis, where, calcium, oxalate, crystals, function, as, dynamic, carbon, pools, supplying, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, to, photosynthetic, cells, when, stomata, are, partially, or, totally, closed, this, process, was, named, alarm, photosynthesis, under, stress, conditions, e, g, water, deficit, oxalate, released, from, calcium, oxalate, crystals, is, converted, to, co, 2, by, an, oxalate, oxidase, enzyme, and, the, produced, co, 2, can, support, the, calvin, cycle, reactions, reactive, hydrogen, peroxide, h, 2, o, 2, the, byproduct, of, oxalate, oxidase, reaction, can, be, neutralized, by, catalase, alarm, photosynthesis, represents, a, photosynthetic, variant, to, be, added, to, the, well, known, c4, and, cam, pathways, however, alarm, photosynthesis, in, contrast, to, these, pathways, operates, as, a, biochemical, pump, that, collects, carbon, from, the, organ, interior, or, from, the, soil, and, not, from, the, atmosphere, cyanobacteria, possess, carboxysomes, which, increase, the, concentration, of, co, 2, around, rubisco, to, increase, the, rate, of, photosynthesis, an, enzyme, carbonic, anhydrase, located, within, the, carboxysome, releases, co, 2, from, dissolved, hydrocarbonate, ions, hco, 3, before, the, co, 2, can, diffuse, out, rubisco, concentrated, within, the, carboxysome, quickly, sponges, it, up, hco, 3, ions, are, made, from, co, 2, outside, the, cell, by, another, carbonic, anhydrase, and, are, actively, pumped, into, the, cell, by, a, membrane, protein, they, cannot, cross, the, membrane, as, they, are, charged, and, within, the, cytosol, they, turn, back, into, co, 2, very, slowly, without, the, help, of, carbonic, anhydrase, this, causes, the, hco, 3, ions, to, accumulate, within, the, cell, from, where, they, diffuse, into, the, carboxysomes, pyrenoids, in, algae, and, hornworts, also, act, to, concentrate, co, 2, around, rubisco, the, overall, process, of, photosynthesis, takes, place, in, four, stages, plants, usually, convert, light, into, chemical, energy, with, a, photosynthetic, efficiency, of, 3, 6, absorbed, light, that, is, unconverted, is, dissipated, primarily, as, heat, with, a, small, fraction, 1, 2, reemitted, as, chlorophyll, fluorescence, at, longer, redder, wavelengths, this, fact, allows, measurement, of, the, light, reaction, of, photosynthesis, by, using, chlorophyll, fluorometers, actual, plants, photosynthetic, efficiency, varies, with, the, frequency, of, the, light, being, converted, light, intensity, temperature, and, proportion, of, carbon, dioxide, in, the, atmosphere, and, can, vary, from, 0, 1, to, 8, by, comparison, solar, panels, convert, light, into, electric, energy, at, an, efficiency, of, approximately, 6, 20, for, mass, produced, panels, and, above, 40, in, laboratory, devices, scientists, are, studying, photosynthesis, in, hopes, of, developing, plants, with, increased, yield, the, efficiency, of, both, light, and, dark, reactions, can, be, measured, but, the, relationship, between, the, two, can, be, complex, for, example, the, light, reaction, creates, atp, and, nadph, energy, molecules, which, c, 3, plants, can, use, for, carbon, fixation, or, photorespiration, electrons, may, also, flow, to, other, electron, sinks, for, this, reason, it, is, not, uncommon, for, authors, to, differentiate, between, work, done, under, non, photorespiratory, conditions, and, under, photorespiratory, conditions, chlorophyll, fluorescence, of, photosystem, ii, can, measure, the, light, reaction, and, infrared, gas, analyzers, can, measure, the, dark, reaction, an, integrated, chlorophyll, fluorometer, and, gas, exchange, system, can, investigate, both, light, and, dark, reactions, when, researchers, use, the, two, separate, systems, together, infrared, gas, analyzers, and, some, moisture, sensors, are, sensitive, enough, to, measure, the, photosynthetic, assimilation, of, co, 2, and, of, h, 2, o, using, reliable, methods, co, 2, is, commonly, measured, in, mols, m, 2, s, parts, per, million, or, volume, per, million, and, h, 2, o, is, commonly, measured, in, mmols, m, 2, s, or, in, mbars, by, measuring, co, 2, assimilation, h, 2, o, leaf, temperature, barometric, pressure, leaf, area, and, photosynthetically, active, radiation, par, it, becomes, possible, to, estimate, a, or, carbon, assimilation, e, or, transpiration, gs, or, stomatal, conductance, and, ci, or, intracellular, co, 2, however, it, is, more, common, to, use, chlorophyll, fluorescence, for, plant, stress, measurement, where, appropriate, because, the, most, commonly, used, parameters, fv, fm, and, y, ii, or, f, fm, can, be, measured, in, a, few, seconds, allowing, the, investigation, of, larger, plant, populations, gas, exchange, systems, that, offer, control, of, co, 2, levels, above, and, below, ambient, allow, the, common, practice, of, measurement, of, a, ci, curves, at, different, co, 2, levels, to, characterize, a, plant, s, photosynthetic, response, integrated, chlorophyll, fluorometer, gas, exchange, systems, allow, a, more, precise, measure, of, photosynthetic, response, and, mechanisms, while, standard, gas, exchange, photosynthesis, systems, can, measure, ci, or, substomatal, co, 2, levels, the, addition, of, integrated, chlorophyll, fluorescence, measurements, allows, a, more, precise, measurement, of, c, c, the, estimation, of, co, 2, concentration, at, the, site, of, carboxylation, in, the, chloroplast, to, replace, ci, co, 2, concentration, in, the, chloroplast, becomes, possible, to, estimate, with, the, measurement, of, mesophyll, conductance, or, g, m, using, an, integrated, system, photosynthesis, measurement, systems, are, not, designed, to, directly, measure, the, amount, of, light, the, leaf, absorbs, but, analysis, of, chlorophyll, fluorescence, p700, and, p515, absorbance, and, gas, exchange, measurements, reveal, detailed, information, about, e, g, the, photosystems, quantum, efficiency, and, the, co, 2, assimilation, rates, with, some, instruments, even, wavelength, dependency, of, the, photosynthetic, efficiency, can, be, analyzed, a, phenomenon, known, as, quantum, walk, increases, the, efficiency, of, the, energy, transport, of, light, significantly, in, the, photosynthetic, cell, of, an, alga, bacterium, or, plant, there, are, light, sensitive, molecules, called, chromophores, arranged, in, an, antenna, shaped, structure, called, a, photocomplex, when, a, photon, is, absorbed, by, a, chromophore, it, is, converted, into, a, quasiparticle, referred, to, as, an, exciton, which, jumps, from, chromophore, to, chromophore, towards, the, reaction, center, of, the, photocomplex, a, collection, of, molecules, that, traps, its, energy, in, a, chemical, form, accessible, to, the, cell, s, metabolism, the, exciton, s, wave, properties, enable, it, to, cover, a, wider, area, and, try, out, several, possible, paths, simultaneously, allowing, it, to, instantaneously, choose, the, most, efficient, route, where, it, will, have, the, highest, probability, of, arriving, at, its, destination, in, the, minimum, possible, time, because, that, quantum, walking, takes, place, at, temperatures, far, higher, than, quantum, phenomena, usually, occur, it, is, only, possible, over, very, short, distances, obstacles, in, the, form, of, destructive, interference, cause, the, particle, to, lose, its, wave, properties, for, an, instant, before, it, regains, them, once, again, after, it, is, freed, from, its, locked, position, through, a, classic, hop, the, movement, of, the, electron, towards, the, photo, center, is, therefore, covered, in, a, series, of, conventional, hops, and, quantum, walks, fossils, of, what, are, thought, to, be, filamentous, photosynthetic, organisms, have, been, dated, at, 3, 4, billion, years, old, more, recent, studies, also, suggest, that, photosynthesis, may, have, begun, about, 3, 4, billion, years, ago, though, the, first, direct, evidence, of, photosynthesis, comes, from, thylakoid, membranes, preserved, in, 1, 75, billion, year, old, cherts, oxygenic, photosynthesis, is, the, main, source, of, oxygen, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, and, its, earliest, appearance, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, oxygen, catastrophe, geological, evidence, suggests, that, oxygenic, photosynthesis, such, as, that, in, cyanobacteria, became, important, during, the, paleoproterozoic, era, around, two, billion, years, ago, modern, photosynthesis, in, plants, and, most, photosynthetic, prokaryotes, is, oxygenic, using, water, as, an, electron, donor, which, is, oxidized, to, molecular, oxygen, in, the, photosynthetic, reaction, center, several, groups, of, animals, have, formed, symbiotic, relationships, with, photosynthetic, algae, these, are, most, common, in, corals, sponges, and, sea, anemones, scientists, presume, that, this, is, due, to, the, particularly, simple, body, plans, and, large, surface, areas, of, these, animals, compared, to, their, volumes, in, addition, a, few, marine, mollusks, such, as, elysia, viridis, and, elysia, chlorotica, also, maintain, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, chloroplasts, they, capture, from, the, algae, in, their, diet, and, then, store, in, their, bodies, see, kleptoplasty, this, allows, the, mollusks, to, survive, solely, by, photosynthesis, for, several, months, at, a, time, some, of, the, genes, from, the, plant, cell, nucleus, have, even, been, transferred, to, the, slugs, so, that, the, chloroplasts, can, be, supplied, with, proteins, they, need, to, survive, an, even, closer, form, of, symbiosis, may, explain, the, origin, of, chloroplasts, chloroplasts, have, many, similarities, with, photosynthetic, bacteria, including, a, circular, chromosome, prokaryotic, type, ribosome, and, similar, proteins, in, the, photosynthetic, reaction, center, the, endosymbiotic, theory, suggests, that, photosynthetic, bacteria, were, acquired, by, endocytosis, by, early, eukaryotic, cells, to, form, the, first, plant, cells, therefore, chloroplasts, may, be, photosynthetic, bacteria, that, adapted, to, life, inside, plant, cells, like, mitochondria, chloroplasts, possess, their, own, dna, separate, from, the, nuclear, dna, of, their, plant, host, cells, and, the, genes, in, this, chloroplast, dna, resemble, those, found, in, cyanobacteria, dna, in, chloroplasts, codes, for, redox, proteins, such, as, those, found, in, the, photosynthetic, reaction, centers, the, corr, hypothesis, proposes, that, this, co, location, of, genes, with, their, gene, products, is, required, for, redox, regulation, of, gene, expression, and, accounts, for, the, persistence, of, dna, in, bioenergetic, organelles, symbiotic, and, kleptoplastic, organisms, excluded, except, for, the, euglenids, which, are, found, within, the, excavata, all, of, these, belong, to, the, diaphoretickes, archaeplastida, and, the, photosynthetic, paulinella, got, their, plastids, which, are, surrounded, by, two, membranes, through, primary, endosymbiosis, in, two, separate, events, by, engulfing, a, cyanobacterium, the, plastids, in, all, the, other, groups, have, either, a, red, or, green, algal, origin, and, are, referred, to, as, the, red, lineages, and, the, green, lineages, the, only, known, exception, is, the, ciliate, pseudoblepharisma, tenue, which, in, addition, to, its, plastids, that, originated, from, green, algae, also, has, a, purple, sulfur, bacterium, as, symbiont, in, dinoflagellates, and, euglenids, the, plastids, are, surrounded, by, three, membranes, and, in, the, remaining, lines, by, four, a, nucleomorph, remnants, of, the, original, algal, nucleus, located, between, the, inner, and, outer, membranes, of, the, plastid, is, present, in, the, cryptophytes, from, a, red, alga, and, chlorarachniophytes, from, a, green, alga, some, dinoflagellates, that, lost, their, photosynthetic, ability, later, regained, it, again, through, new, endosymbiotic, events, with, different, algae, while, able, to, perform, photosynthesis, many, of, these, eukaryotic, groups, are, mixotrophs, and, practice, heterotrophy, to, various, degrees, early, photosynthetic, systems, such, as, those, in, green, and, purple, sulfur, and, green, and, purple, nonsulfur, bacteria, are, thought, to, have, been, anoxygenic, and, used, various, other, molecules, than, water, as, electron, donors, green, and, purple, sulfur, bacteria, are, thought, to, have, used, hydrogen, and, sulfur, as, electron, donors, green, nonsulfur, bacteria, used, various, amino, and, other, organic, acids, as, electron, donors, purple, nonsulfur, bacteria, used, a, variety, of, nonspecific, organic, molecules, the, use, of, these, molecules, is, consistent, with, the, geological, evidence, that, earth, s, early, atmosphere, was, highly, reducing, at, that, time, with, a, possible, exception, of, heimdallarchaeota, photosynthesis, is, not, found, in, archaea, haloarchaea, are, phototrophic, and, can, absorb, energy, from, the, sun, but, do, not, harvest, carbon, from, the, atmosphere, and, are, therefore, not, photosynthetic, instead, of, chlorophyll, they, use, rhodopsins, which, convert, light, energy, to, ion, gradients, but, cannot, mediate, electron, transfer, reactions, in, bacteria, eight, photosynthetic, lineages, are, currently, known, the, biochemical, capacity, to, use, water, as, the, source, for, electrons, in, photosynthesis, evolved, once, in, a, common, ancestor, of, extant, cyanobacteria, formerly, called, blue, green, algae, the, geological, record, indicates, that, this, transforming, event, took, place, early, in, earth, s, history, at, least, 2450, 2320, million, years, ago, ma, and, it, is, speculated, much, earlier, because, the, earth, s, atmosphere, contained, almost, no, oxygen, during, the, estimated, development, of, photosynthesis, it, is, believed, that, the, first, photosynthetic, cyanobacteria, did, not, generate, oxygen, available, evidence, from, geobiological, studies, of, archean, 2500, ma, sedimentary, rocks, indicates, that, life, existed, 3500, ma, but, the, question, of, when, oxygenic, photosynthesis, evolved, is, still, unanswered, a, clear, paleontological, window, on, cyanobacterial, evolution, opened, about, 2000, ma, revealing, an, already, diverse, biota, of, cyanobacteria, cyanobacteria, remained, the, principal, primary, producers, of, oxygen, throughout, the, proterozoic, eon, 2500, 543, ma, in, part, because, the, redox, structure, of, the, oceans, favored, photoautotrophs, capable, of, nitrogen, fixation, green, algae, joined, cyanobacteria, as, the, major, primary, producers, of, oxygen, on, continental, shelves, near, the, end, of, the, proterozoic, but, only, with, the, mesozoic, 251, 66, ma, radiations, of, dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and, diatoms, did, the, primary, production, of, oxygen, in, marine, shelf, waters, take, modern, form, cyanobacteria, remain, critical, to, marine, ecosystems, as, primary, producers, of, oxygen, in, oceanic, gyres, as, agents, of, biological, nitrogen, fixation, and, in, modified, form, as, the, plastids, of, marine, algae, although, some, of, the, steps, in, photosynthesis, are, still, not, completely, understood, the, overall, photosynthetic, equation, has, been, known, since, the, 19th, century, jan, van, helmont, began, the, research, of, the, process, in, the, mid, 17th, century, when, he, carefully, measured, the, mass, of, the, soil, a, plant, was, using, and, the, mass, of, the, plant, as, it, grew, after, noticing, that, the, soil, mass, changed, very, little, he, hypothesized, that, the, mass, of, the, growing, plant, must, come, from, the, water, the, only, substance, he, added, to, the, potted, plant, his, hypothesis, was, partially, accurate, much, of, the, gained, mass, comes, from, carbon, dioxide, as, well, as, water, however, this, was, a, signaling, point, to, the, idea, that, the, bulk, of, a, plant, s, biomass, comes, from, the, inputs, of, photosynthesis, not, the, soil, itself, joseph, priestley, a, chemist, and, minister, discovered, that, when, he, isolated, a, volume, of, air, under, an, inverted, jar, and, burned, a, candle, in, it, which, gave, off, co, 2, the, candle, would, burn, out, very, quickly, much, before, it, ran, out, of, wax, he, further, discovered, that, a, mouse, could, similarly, injure, air, he, then, showed, that, a, plant, could, restore, the, air, the, candle, and, the, mouse, had, injured, in, 1779, jan, ingenhousz, repeated, priestley, s, experiments, he, discovered, that, it, was, the, influence, of, sunlight, on, the, plant, that, could, cause, it, to, revive, a, mouse, in, a, matter, of, hours, in, 1796, jean, senebier, a, swiss, pastor, botanist, and, naturalist, demonstrated, that, green, plants, consume, carbon, dioxide, and, release, oxygen, under, the, influence, of, light, soon, afterward, nicolas, th, odore, de, saussure, showed, that, the, increase, in, mass, of, the, plant, as, it, grows, could, not, be, due, only, to, uptake, of, co, 2, but, also, to, the, incorporation, of, water, thus, the, basic, reaction, by, which, organisms, use, photosynthesis, to, produce, food, such, as, glucose, was, outlined, cornelis, van, niel, made, key, discoveries, explaining, the, chemistry, of, photosynthesis, by, studying, purple, sulfur, bacteria, and, green, bacteria, he, was, the, first, to, demonstrate, that, photosynthesis, is, a, light, dependent, redox, reaction, in, which, hydrogen, reduces, donates, its, atoms, as, electrons, and, protons, to, carbon, dioxide, robert, emerson, discovered, two, light, reactions, by, testing, plant, productivity, using, different, wavelengths, of, light, with, the, red, alone, the, light, reactions, were, suppressed, when, blue, and, red, were, combined, the, output, was, much, more, substantial, thus, there, were, two, photosystems, one, absorbing, up, to, 600, nm, wavelengths, the, other, up, to, 700, nm, the, former, is, known, as, psii, the, latter, is, psi, psi, contains, only, chlorophyll, a, psii, contains, primarily, chlorophyll, a, with, most, of, the, available, chlorophyll, b, among, other, pigments, these, include, phycobilins, which, are, the, red, and, blue, pigments, of, red, and, blue, algae, respectively, and, fucoxanthol, for, brown, algae, and, diatoms, the, process, is, most, productive, when, the, absorption, of, quanta, is, equal, in, both, psii, and, psi, assuring, that, input, energy, from, the, antenna, complex, is, divided, between, the, psi, and, psii, systems, which, in, turn, powers, the, photochemistry, robert, hill, thought, that, a, complex, of, reactions, consisted, of, an, intermediate, to, cytochrome, b, 6, now, a, plastoquinone, and, that, another, was, from, cytochrome, f, to, a, step, in, the, carbohydrate, generating, mechanisms, these, are, linked, by, plastoquinone, which, does, require, energy, to, reduce, cytochrome, f, further, experiments, to, prove, that, the, oxygen, developed, during, the, photosynthesis, of, green, plants, came, from, water, were, performed, by, hill, in, 1937, and, 1939, he, showed, that, isolated, chloroplasts, give, off, oxygen, in, the, presence, of, unnatural, reducing, agents, like, iron, oxalate, ferricyanide, or, benzoquinone, after, exposure, to, light, in, the, hill, reaction, a, is, the, electron, acceptor, therefore, in, light, the, electron, acceptor, is, reduced, and, oxygen, is, evolved, samuel, ruben, and, martin, kamen, used, radioactive, isotopes, to, determine, that, the, oxygen, liberated, in, photosynthesis, came, from, the, water, melvin, calvin, and, andrew, benson, along, with, james, bassham, elucidated, the, path, of, carbon, assimilation, the, photosynthetic, carbon, reduction, cycle, in, plants, the, carbon, reduction, cycle, is, known, as, the, calvin, cycle, but, many, scientists, refer, to, it, as, the, calvin, benson, benson, calvin, or, even, calvin, benson, bassham, or, cbb, cycle, nobel, prize, winning, scientist, rudolph, a, marcus, was, later, able, to, discover, the, function, and, significance, of, the, electron, transport, chain, otto, heinrich, warburg, and, dean, burk, discovered, the, i, quantum, photosynthesis, reaction, that, splits, co, 2, activated, by, the, respiration, in, 1950, first, experimental, evidence, for, the, existence, of, photophosphorylation, in, vivo, was, presented, by, otto, kandler, using, intact, chlorella, cells, and, interpreting, his, findings, as, light, dependent, atp, formation, in, 1954, daniel, i, arnon, et, al, discovered, photophosphorylation, in, vitro, in, isolated, chloroplasts, with, the, help, of, p, 32, louis, n, m, duysens, and, jan, amesz, discovered, that, chlorophyll, a, will, absorb, one, light, oxidize, cytochrome, f, while, chlorophyll, a, and, other, pigments, will, absorb, another, light, but, will, reduce, this, same, oxidized, cytochrome, stating, the, two, light, reactions, are, in, series, in, 1893, the, american, botanist, charles, reid, barnes, proposed, two, terms, photosyntax, and, photosynthesis, for, the, biological, process, of, synthesis, of, complex, carbon, compounds, out, of, carbonic, acid, in, the, presence, of, chlorophyll, under, the, influence, of, light, the, term, photosynthesis, is, derived, from, the, greek, ph, s, gleam, and, s, nthesis, arranging, together, while, another, word, that, he, designated, was, photosyntax, from, s, ntaxis, configuration, over, time, the, term, photosynthesis, came, into, common, usage, later, discovery, of, anoxygenic, photosynthetic, bacteria, and, photophosphorylation, necessitated, redefinition, of, the, term, in, the, late, 1940s, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, the, details, of, photosynthetic, carbon, metabolism, were, sorted, out, by, the, chemists, melvin, calvin, andrew, benson, james, bassham, and, a, score, of, students, and, researchers, utilizing, the, carbon, 14, isotope, and, paper, chromatography, techniques, the, pathway, of, co, 2, fixation, by, the, algae, chlorella, in, a, fraction, of, a, second, in, light, resulted, in, a, three, carbon, molecule, called, phosphoglyceric, acid, pga, for, that, original, and, ground, breaking, work, a, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, was, awarded, to, melvin, calvin, in, 1961, in, parallel, plant, physiologists, studied, leaf, gas, exchanges, using, the, new, method, of, infrared, gas, analysis, and, a, leaf, chamber, where, the, net, photosynthetic, rates, ranged, from, 10, to, 13, mol, co, 2, m, 2, s, 1, with, the, conclusion, that, all, terrestrial, plants, have, the, same, photosynthetic, capacities, that, are, light, saturated, at, less, than, 50, of, sunlight, later, in, 1958, 1963, at, cornell, university, field, grown, maize, was, reported, to, have, much, greater, leaf, photosynthetic, rates, of, 40, mol, co, 2, m, 2, s, 1, and, not, be, saturated, at, near, full, sunlight, this, higher, rate, in, maize, was, almost, double, of, those, observed, in, other, species, such, as, wheat, and, soybean, indicating, that, large, differences, in, photosynthesis, exist, among, higher, plants, at, the, university, of, arizona, detailed, gas, exchange, research, on, more, than, 15, species, of, monocots, and, dicots, uncovered, for, the, first, time, that, differences, in, leaf, anatomy, are, crucial, factors, in, differentiating, photosynthetic, capacities, among, species, in, tropical, grasses, including, maize, sorghum, sugarcane, bermuda, grass, and, in, the, dicot, amaranthus, leaf, photosynthetic, rates, were, around, 38, 40, mol, co, 2, m, 2, s, 1, and, the, leaves, have, two, types, of, green, cells, i, e, outer, layer, of, mesophyll, cells, surrounding, a, tightly, packed, cholorophyllous, vascular, bundle, sheath, cells, this, type, of, anatomy, was, termed, kranz, anatomy, in, the, 19th, century, by, the, botanist, gottlieb, haberlandt, while, studying, leaf, anatomy, of, sugarcane, plant, species, with, the, greatest, photosynthetic, rates, and, kranz, anatomy, showed, no, apparent, photorespiration, very, low, co, 2, compensation, point, high, optimum, temperature, high, stomatal, resistances, and, lower, mesophyll, resistances, for, gas, diffusion, and, rates, never, saturated, at, full, sun, light, the, research, at, arizona, was, designated, a, citation, classic, in, 1986, these, species, were, later, termed, c4, plants, as, the, first, stable, compound, of, co, 2, fixation, in, light, has, four, carbons, as, malate, and, aspartate, other, species, that, lack, kranz, anatomy, were, termed, c3, type, such, as, cotton, and, sunflower, as, the, first, stable, carbon, compound, is, the, three, carbon, pga, at, 1000, ppm, co, 2, in, measuring, air, both, the, c3, and, c4, plants, had, similar, leaf, photosynthetic, rates, around, 60, mol, co, 2, m, 2, s, 1, indicating, the, suppression, of, photorespiration, in, c3, plants, there, are, four, main, factors, influencing, photosynthesis, and, several, corollary, factors, the, four, main, are, total, photosynthesis, is, limited, by, a, range, of, environmental, factors, these, include, the, amount, of, light, available, the, amount, of, leaf, area, a, plant, has, to, capture, light, shading, by, other, plants, is, a, major, limitation, of, photosynthesis, the, rate, at, which, carbon, dioxide, can, be, supplied, to, the, chloroplasts, to, support, photosynthesis, the, availability, of, water, and, the, availability, of, suitable, temperatures, for, carrying, out, photosynthesis, the, process, of, photosynthesis, provides, the, main, input, of, free, energy, into, the, biosphere, and, is, one, of, four, main, ways, in, which, radiation, is, important, for, plant, life, the, radiation, climate, within, plant, communities, is, extremely, variable, in, both, time, and, space, in, the, early, 20th, century, frederick, blackman, and, gabrielle, matthaei, investigated, the, effects, of, light, intensity, irradiance, and, temperature, on, the, rate, of, carbon, assimilation, these, two, experiments, illustrate, several, important, points, first, it, is, known, that, in, general, photochemical, reactions, are, not, affected, by, temperature, however, these, experiments, clearly, show, that, temperature, affects, the, rate, of, carbon, assimilation, so, there, must, be, two, sets, of, reactions, in, the, full, process, of, carbon, assimilation, these, are, the, light, dependent, photochemical, temperature, independent, stage, and, the, light, independent, temperature, dependent, stage, second, blackman, s, experiments, illustrate, the, concept, of, limiting, factors, another, limiting, factor, is, the, wavelength, of, light, cyanobacteria, which, reside, several, meters, underwater, cannot, receive, the, correct, wavelengths, required, to, cause, photoinduced, charge, separation, in, conventional, photosynthetic, pigments, to, combat, this, problem, cyanobacteria, have, a, light, harvesting, complex, called, phycobilisome, this, complex, is, made, up, of, a, series, of, proteins, with, different, pigments, which, surround, the, reaction, center, as, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, rise, the, rate, at, which, sugars, are, made, by, the, light, independent, reactions, increases, until, limited, by, other, factors, rubisco, the, enzyme, that, captures, carbon, dioxide, in, the, light, independent, reactions, has, a, binding, affinity, for, both, carbon, dioxide, and, oxygen, when, the, concentration, of, carbon, dioxide, is, high, rubisco, will, fix, carbon, dioxide, however, if, the, carbon, dioxide, concentration, is, low, rubisco, will, bind, oxygen, instead, of, carbon, dioxide, this, process, called, photorespiration, uses, energy, but, does, not, produce, sugars, rubisco, oxygenase, activity, is, disadvantageous, to, plants, for, several, reasons, the, salvaging, pathway, for, the, products, of, rubisco, oxygenase, activity, is, more, commonly, known, as, photorespiration, since, it, is, characterized, by, light, dependent, oxygen, consumption, and, the, release, of, carbon, dioxide
