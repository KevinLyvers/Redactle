apatosaurus, p, t, s, r, s, meaning, deceptive, lizard, is, a, genus, of, herbivorous, sauropod, dinosaur, that, lived, in, north, america, during, the, late, jurassic, period, othniel, charles, marsh, described, and, named, the, first, known, species, a, ajax, in, 1877, and, a, second, species, a, louisae, was, discovered, and, named, by, william, h, holland, in, 1916, apatosaurus, lived, about, 152, to, 151, million, years, ago, mya, during, the, late, kimmeridgian, to, early, tithonian, age, and, are, now, known, from, fossils, in, the, morrison, formation, of, modern, day, colorado, oklahoma, new, mexico, wyoming, and, utah, in, the, united, states, apatosaurus, had, an, average, length, of, 21, 23, m, 69, 75, ft, and, an, average, mass, of, 16, 4, 22, 4, t, 16, 1, 22, 0, long, tons, 18, 1, 24, 7, short, tons, a, few, specimens, indicate, a, maximum, length, of, 11, 30, greater, than, average, and, a, mass, of, approximately, 33, t, 32, long, tons, 36, short, tons, the, cervical, vertebrae, of, apatosaurus, are, less, elongated, and, more, heavily, constructed, than, those, of, diplodocus, a, diplodocid, like, apatosaurus, and, the, bones, of, the, leg, are, much, stockier, despite, being, longer, implying, that, apatosaurus, was, a, more, robust, animal, the, tail, was, held, above, the, ground, during, normal, locomotion, apatosaurus, had, a, single, claw, on, each, forelimb, and, three, on, each, hindlimb, the, apatosaurus, skull, long, thought, to, be, similar, to, camarasaurus, is, much, more, similar, to, that, of, diplodocus, apatosaurus, was, a, generalized, browser, that, likely, held, its, head, elevated, to, lighten, its, vertebrae, apatosaurus, had, air, sacs, that, made, the, bones, internally, full, of, holes, like, that, of, other, diplodocids, its, tail, may, have, been, used, as, a, whip, to, create, loud, noises, or, as, more, recently, suggested, as, a, sensory, organ, the, skull, of, apatosaurus, was, confused, with, that, of, camarasaurus, and, brachiosaurus, until, 1909, when, the, holotype, of, a, louisae, was, found, and, a, complete, skull, just, a, few, meters, away, from, the, front, of, the, neck, henry, fairfield, osborn, disagreed, with, this, association, and, went, on, to, mount, a, skeleton, of, apatosaurus, with, a, camarasaurus, skull, cast, apatosaurus, skeletons, were, mounted, with, speculative, skull, casts, until, 1970, when, mcintosh, showed, that, more, robust, skulls, assigned, to, diplodocus, were, more, likely, from, apatosaurus, apatosaurus, is, a, genus, in, the, family, diplodocidae, it, is, one, of, the, more, basal, genera, with, only, amphicoelias, and, possibly, a, new, unnamed, genus, more, primitive, although, the, subfamily, apatosaurinae, was, named, in, 1929, the, group, was, not, used, validly, until, an, extensive, 2015, study, only, brontosaurus, is, also, in, the, subfamily, with, the, other, genera, being, considered, synonyms, or, reclassified, as, diplodocines, brontosaurus, has, long, been, considered, a, junior, synonym, of, apatosaurus, its, type, species, was, reclassified, as, a, excelsus, in, 1903, a, 2015, study, concluded, that, brontosaurus, is, a, valid, genus, of, sauropod, distinct, from, apatosaurus, but, not, all, paleontologists, agree, with, this, division, as, it, existed, in, north, america, during, the, late, jurassic, apatosaurus, would, have, lived, alongside, dinosaurs, such, as, allosaurus, camarasaurus, diplodocus, and, stegosaurus, apatosaurus, was, a, large, long, necked, quadrupedal, animal, with, a, long, whip, like, tail, its, forelimbs, were, slightly, shorter, than, its, hindlimbs, most, size, estimates, are, based, on, specimen, cm, 3018, the, type, specimen, of, a, louisae, reaching, 21, 23, m, 69, 75, ft, in, length, and, 16, 4, 22, 4, t, 16, 1, 22, 0, long, tons, 18, 1, 24, 7, short, tons, in, body, mass, a, 2015, study, that, estimated, the, mass, of, volumetric, models, of, dreadnoughtus, apatosaurus, and, giraffatitan, estimates, cm, 3018, at, 21, 8, 38, 2, t, 21, 5, 37, 6, long, tons, 24, 0, 42, 1, short, tons, similar, in, mass, to, dreadnoughtus, some, specimens, of, a, ajax, such, as, omnh, 1670, represent, individuals, 11, 30, longer, suggesting, masses, twice, that, of, cm, 3018, or, 32, 7, 72, 6, t, 32, 2, 71, 5, long, tons, 36, 0, 80, 0, short, tons, potentially, rivaling, the, largest, titanosaurs, however, the, upper, size, estimate, of, omnh, 1670, is, likely, an, exaggeration, with, the, size, estimates, revised, in, 2020, at, 30, m, 98, ft, in, length, and, 33, t, 36, short, tons, in, body, mass, based, on, volumetric, analysis, the, skull, is, small, in, relation, to, the, size, of, the, animal, the, jaws, are, lined, with, spatulate, chisel, like, teeth, suited, to, an, herbivorous, diet, the, snout, of, apatosaurus, and, similar, diplodocoids, is, squared, with, only, nigersaurus, having, a, squarer, skull, the, braincase, of, apatosaurus, is, well, preserved, in, specimen, byu, 17096, which, also, preserved, much, of, the, skeleton, a, phylogenetic, analysis, found, that, the, braincase, had, a, morphology, similar, to, those, of, other, diplodocoids, some, skulls, of, apatosaurus, have, been, found, still, in, articulation, with, their, teeth, those, teeth, that, have, the, enamel, surface, exposed, do, not, show, any, scratches, on, the, surface, instead, they, display, a, sugary, texture, and, little, wear, like, those, of, other, sauropods, the, neck, vertebrae, are, deeply, bifurcated, they, carried, neural, spines, with, a, large, trough, in, the, middle, resulting, in, a, wide, deep, neck, the, vertebral, formula, for, the, holotype, of, a, louisae, is, 15, cervicals, 10, dorsals, 5, sacrals, and, 82, caudals, the, caudal, vertebra, number, may, vary, even, within, species, the, cervical, vertebrae, of, apatosaurus, and, brontosaurus, are, stouter, and, more, robust, than, those, of, other, diplodocids, and, were, found, to, be, most, similar, to, camarasaurus, by, charles, whitney, gilmore, in, addition, they, support, cervical, ribs, that, extend, farther, towards, the, ground, than, in, diplodocines, and, have, vertebrae, and, ribs, that, are, narrower, towards, the, top, of, the, neck, making, the, neck, nearly, triangular, in, cross, section, in, apatosaurus, louisae, the, atlas, axis, complex, of, the, first, cervicals, is, nearly, fused, the, dorsal, ribs, are, not, fused, or, tightly, attached, to, their, vertebrae, and, are, instead, loosely, articulated, apatosaurus, has, ten, dorsal, ribs, on, either, side, of, the, body, the, large, neck, was, filled, with, an, extensive, system, of, weight, saving, air, sacs, apatosaurus, like, its, close, relative, supersaurus, has, tall, neural, spines, which, make, up, more, than, half, the, height, of, the, individual, bones, of, its, vertebrae, the, shape, of, the, tail, is, unusual, for, a, diplodocid, it, is, comparatively, slender, because, of, the, rapidly, decreasing, height, of, the, vertebral, spines, with, increasing, distance, from, the, hips, apatosaurus, also, had, very, long, ribs, compared, to, most, other, diplodocids, giving, it, an, unusually, deep, chest, as, in, other, diplodocids, the, tail, transformed, into, a, whip, like, structure, towards, the, end, the, limb, bones, are, also, very, robust, within, apatosaurinae, the, scapula, of, apatosaurus, louisae, is, intermediate, in, morphology, between, those, of, a, ajax, and, brontosaurus, excelsus, the, arm, bones, are, stout, so, the, humerus, of, apatosaurus, resembles, that, of, camarasaurus, as, well, as, brontosaurus, however, the, humeri, of, brontosaurus, and, a, ajax, are, more, similar, to, each, other, than, they, are, to, a, louisae, in, 1936, charles, gilmore, noted, that, previous, reconstructions, of, apatosaurus, forelimbs, erroneously, proposed, that, the, radius, and, ulna, could, cross, in, life, they, would, have, remained, parallel, apatosaurus, had, a, single, large, claw, on, each, forelimb, a, feature, shared, by, all, sauropods, more, derived, than, shunosaurus, the, first, three, toes, had, claws, on, each, hindlimb, the, phalangeal, formula, is, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, meaning, the, innermost, finger, phalanx, on, the, forelimb, has, two, bones, and, the, next, has, one, the, single, manual, claw, bone, ungual, is, slightly, curved, and, squarely, truncated, on, the, anterior, end, the, pelvic, girdle, includes, the, robust, ilia, and, the, fused, co, ossified, pubes, and, ischia, the, femora, of, apatosaurus, are, very, stout, and, represent, some, of, the, most, robust, femora, of, any, member, of, sauropoda, the, tibia, and, fibula, bones, are, different, from, the, slender, bones, of, diplodocus, but, are, nearly, indistinguishable, from, those, of, camarasaurus, the, fibula, is, longer, and, slenderer, than, the, tibia, the, foot, of, apatosaurus, has, three, claws, on, the, innermost, digits, the, digit, formula, is, 3, 4, 5, 3, 2, the, first, metatarsal, is, the, stoutest, a, feature, shared, among, diplodocids, the, first, apatosaurus, fossils, were, discovered, by, arthur, lakes, a, local, miner, and, his, friend, henry, c, beckwith, in, the, spring, of, 1877, in, morrison, a, town, in, the, eastern, foothills, of, the, rocky, mountains, in, jefferson, county, colorado, arthur, lakes, wrote, to, othniel, charles, marsh, professor, of, paleontology, at, yale, university, and, edward, drinker, cope, a, paleontologist, based, in, philadelphia, about, the, discovery, until, eventually, collecting, several, fossils, and, sending, them, to, both, paleontologists, marsh, named, atlantosaurus, montanus, based, on, some, of, the, fossils, sent, and, hired, lakes, to, collect, the, rest, of, the, material, at, morrison, and, send, it, to, yale, while, cope, attempted, to, hire, lakes, as, well, but, was, rejected, one, of, the, best, specimens, collected, by, lakes, in, 1877, was, a, well, preserved, partial, postcranial, skeleton, including, many, vertebrae, and, a, partial, braincase, ypm, vp, 1860, which, was, sent, to, marsh, and, named, apatosaurus, ajax, in, november, 1877, the, composite, term, apatosaurus, comes, from, the, greek, words, apat, apat, los, meaning, deception, deceptive, and, sauros, meaning, lizard, thus, deceptive, lizard, marsh, gave, it, this, name, based, on, the, chevron, bones, which, are, dissimilar, to, those, of, other, dinosaurs, instead, the, chevron, bones, of, apatosaurus, showed, similarities, with, those, of, mosasaurs, most, likely, that, of, the, representative, species, mosasaurus, by, the, end, of, excavations, at, lakes, quarry, in, morrison, several, partial, specimens, of, apatosaurus, had, been, collected, but, only, the, type, specimen, of, a, ajax, can, be, confidently, referred, to, the, species, during, excavation, and, transportation, the, bones, of, the, holotype, skeleton, were, mixed, with, those, of, another, apatosaurine, individual, originally, described, as, atlantosaurus, immanis, as, a, consequence, some, elements, cannot, be, ascribed, to, either, specimen, with, confidence, marsh, distinguished, the, new, genus, apatosaurus, from, atlantosaurus, on, the, basis, of, the, number, of, sacral, vertebrae, with, apatosaurus, possessing, three, and, atlantosaurus, four, recent, research, shows, that, traits, usually, used, to, distinguish, taxa, at, this, time, were, actually, widespread, across, several, taxa, causing, many, of, the, taxa, named, to, be, invalid, like, atlantosaurus, two, years, later, marsh, announced, the, discovery, of, a, larger, and, more, complete, specimen, ypm, vp, 1980, from, como, bluff, wyoming, he, gave, this, specimen, the, name, brontosaurus, excelsus, also, at, como, bluff, the, hubbell, brothers, working, for, edward, drinker, cope, collected, a, tibia, fibula, scapula, and, several, caudal, vertebrae, along, with, other, fragments, belonging, to, apatosaurus, in, 1877, 78, at, cope, s, quarry, 5, at, the, site, later, in, 1884, othniel, marsh, named, diplodocus, lacustris, based, on, a, chimeric, partial, dentary, snout, and, several, teeth, collected, by, lakes, in, 1877, at, morrison, in, 2013, it, was, suggested, that, the, dentary, of, d, lacustris, and, its, teeth, were, actually, from, apatosaurus, ajax, based, on, its, proximity, to, the, type, braincase, of, a, ajax, all, specimens, currently, considered, apatosaurus, were, from, the, morrison, formation, the, location, of, the, excavations, of, marsh, and, cope, after, the, end, of, the, bone, wars, many, major, institutions, in, the, eastern, united, states, were, inspired, by, the, depictions, and, finds, by, marsh, and, cope, to, assemble, their, own, dinosaur, fossil, collections, the, competition, to, mount, the, first, sauropod, skeleton, specifically, was, the, most, intense, with, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, carnegie, museum, of, natural, history, and, field, museum, of, natural, history, all, sending, expeditions, to, the, west, to, find, the, most, complete, sauropod, specimen, bring, it, back, to, the, home, institution, and, mount, it, in, their, fossil, halls, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, was, the, first, to, launch, an, expedition, finding, a, well, preserved, skeleton, amnh, 460, which, is, occasionally, assigned, to, apatosaurus, is, considered, nearly, complete, only, the, head, feet, and, sections, of, the, tail, are, missing, and, it, was, the, first, sauropod, skeleton, mounted, the, specimen, was, found, north, of, medicine, bow, wyoming, in, 1898, by, walter, granger, and, took, the, entire, summer, to, extract, to, complete, the, mount, sauropod, feet, that, were, discovered, at, the, same, quarry, and, a, tail, fashioned, to, appear, as, marsh, believed, it, should, but, which, had, too, few, vertebrae, were, added, in, addition, a, sculpted, model, of, what, the, museum, thought, the, skull, of, this, massive, creature, might, look, like, was, made, this, was, not, a, delicate, skull, like, that, of, diplodocus, which, was, later, found, to, be, more, accurate, but, was, based, on, the, biggest, thickest, strongest, skull, bones, lower, jaws, and, tooth, crowns, from, three, different, quarries, these, skulls, were, likely, those, of, camarasaurus, the, only, other, sauropod, for, which, good, skull, material, was, known, at, the, time, the, mount, construction, was, overseen, by, adam, hermann, who, failed, to, find, apatosaurus, skulls, hermann, was, forced, to, sculpt, a, stand, in, skull, by, hand, osborn, said, in, a, publication, that, the, skull, was, largely, conjectural, and, based, on, that, of, morosaurus, now, camarasaurus, in, 1903, elmer, riggs, published, a, study, that, described, a, well, preserved, skeleton, of, a, diplodocid, from, the, grand, river, valley, near, fruita, colorado, field, museum, of, natural, history, specimen, p25112, riggs, thought, that, the, deposits, were, similar, in, age, to, those, of, the, como, bluff, in, wyoming, from, which, marsh, had, described, brontosaurus, most, of, the, skeleton, was, found, and, after, comparison, with, both, brontosaurus, and, apatosaurus, ajax, riggs, realized, that, the, holotype, of, a, ajax, was, immature, and, thus, the, features, distinguishing, the, genera, were, not, valid, since, apatosaurus, was, the, earlier, name, brontosaurus, should, be, considered, a, junior, synonym, of, apatosaurus, because, of, this, riggs, recombined, brontosaurus, excelsus, as, apatosaurus, excelsus, based, on, comparisons, with, other, species, proposed, to, belong, to, apatosaurus, riggs, also, determined, that, the, field, columbian, museum, specimen, was, likely, most, similar, to, a, excelsus, despite, riggs, publication, henry, fairfield, osborn, who, was, a, strong, opponent, of, marsh, and, his, taxa, labeled, the, apatosaurus, mount, of, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, brontosaurus, because, of, this, decision, the, name, brontosaurus, was, commonly, used, outside, of, scientific, literature, for, what, riggs, considered, apatosaurus, and, the, museum, s, popularity, meant, that, brontosaurus, became, one, of, the, best, known, dinosaurs, even, though, it, was, invalid, throughout, nearly, all, of, the, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, it, was, not, until, 1909, that, an, apatosaurus, skull, was, found, during, the, first, expedition, led, by, earl, douglass, to, what, would, become, known, as, the, carnegie, quarry, at, dinosaur, national, monument, the, skull, was, found, a, short, distance, from, a, skeleton, specimen, cm, 3018, identified, as, the, new, species, apatosaurus, louisae, named, after, louise, carnegie, wife, of, andrew, carnegie, who, funded, field, research, to, find, complete, dinosaur, skeletons, in, the, american, west, the, skull, was, designated, cm, 11162, it, was, very, similar, to, the, skull, of, diplodocus, another, smaller, skeleton, of, a, louisae, was, found, nearby, cm, 11162, and, cm, 3018, the, skull, was, accepted, as, belonging, to, the, apatosaurus, specimen, by, douglass, and, carnegie, museum, director, william, h, holland, although, other, scientists, most, notably, osborn, rejected, this, identification, holland, defended, his, view, in, 1914, in, an, address, to, the, paleontological, society, of, america, yet, he, left, the, carnegie, museum, mount, headless, while, some, thought, holland, was, attempting, to, avoid, conflict, with, osborn, others, suspected, holland, was, waiting, until, an, articulated, skull, and, neck, were, found, to, confirm, the, association, of, the, skull, and, skeleton, after, holland, s, death, in, 1934, museum, staff, placed, a, cast, of, a, camarasaurus, skull, on, the, mount, while, most, other, museums, were, using, cast, or, sculpted, camarasaurus, skulls, on, apatosaurus, mounts, the, yale, peabody, museum, decided, to, sculpt, a, skull, based, on, the, lower, jaw, of, a, camarasaurus, with, the, cranium, based, on, marsh, s, 1891, illustration, of, the, skull, the, skull, also, included, forward, pointing, nasals, something, unusual, for, any, dinosaur, and, fenestrae, differing, from, both, the, drawing, and, other, skulls, no, apatosaurus, skull, was, mentioned, in, literature, until, the, 1970s, when, john, stanton, mcintosh, and, david, berman, redescribed, the, skulls, of, diplodocus, and, apatosaurus, they, found, that, though, he, never, published, his, opinion, holland, was, almost, certainly, correct, that, apatosaurus, had, a, diplodocus, like, skull, according, to, them, many, skulls, long, thought, to, pertain, to, diplodocus, might, instead, be, those, of, apatosaurus, they, reassigned, multiple, skulls, to, apatosaurus, based, on, associated, and, closely, associated, vertebrae, even, though, they, supported, holland, it, was, noted, that, apatosaurus, might, have, possessed, a, camarasaurus, like, skull, based, on, a, disarticulated, camarasaurus, like, tooth, found, at, the, precise, site, where, an, apatosaurus, specimen, was, found, years, before, on, october, 20, 1979, after, the, publications, by, mcintosh, and, berman, the, first, true, skull, of, apatosaurus, was, mounted, on, a, skeleton, in, a, museum, that, of, the, carnegie, in, 1998, it, was, suggested, that, the, felch, quarry, skull, that, marsh, had, included, in, his, 1896, skeletal, restoration, instead, belonged, to, brachiosaurus, this, was, supported, in, 2020, with, a, redescription, of, the, brachiosaurid, material, found, at, the, felch, quarry, in, 2011, the, first, specimen, of, apatosaurus, where, a, skull, was, found, articulated, with, its, cervical, vertebrae, was, described, this, specimen, cmc, vp, 7180, was, found, to, differ, in, both, skull, and, neck, features, from, a, louisae, but, shared, many, features, of, the, cervical, vertebrae, with, a, ajax, another, well, preserved, skull, is, brigham, young, university, specimen, 17096, a, well, preserved, skull, and, skeleton, with, a, preserved, braincase, the, specimen, was, found, in, cactus, park, quarry, in, western, colorado, in, 2013, matthew, mossbrucker, and, several, other, authors, published, an, abstract, that, described, a, premaxilla, and, maxilla, from, lakes, original, quarry, in, morrison, and, referred, the, material, to, apatosaurus, ajax, almost, all, modern, paleontologists, agreed, with, riggs, that, the, two, dinosaurs, should, be, classified, together, in, a, single, genus, according, to, the, rules, of, the, iczn, which, governs, the, scientific, names, of, animals, the, name, apatosaurus, having, been, published, first, has, priority, as, the, official, name, brontosaurus, was, considered, a, junior, synonym, and, was, therefore, long, discarded, from, formal, use, despite, this, at, least, one, paleontologist, robert, t, bakker, argued, in, the, 1990s, that, a, ajax, and, a, excelsus, were, in, fact, sufficiently, distinct, for, the, latter, to, merit, a, separate, genus, in, 2015, emanuel, tschopp, oct, vio, mateus, and, roger, benson, released, a, paper, on, diplodocoid, systematics, and, proposed, that, genera, could, be, diagnosed, by, thirteen, differing, characters, and, species, separated, based, on, six, the, minimum, number, for, generic, separation, was, chosen, based, on, the, fact, that, a, ajax, and, a, louisae, differ, in, twelve, characters, and, diplodocus, carnegiei, and, d, hallorum, differ, in, eleven, characters, thus, thirteen, characters, were, chosen, to, validate, the, separation, of, genera, the, six, differing, features, for, specific, separation, were, chosen, by, counting, the, number, of, differing, features, in, separate, specimens, generally, agreed, to, represent, one, species, with, only, one, differing, character, in, d, carnegiei, and, a, louisae, but, five, differing, features, in, b, excelsus, therefore, tschopp, et, al, argued, that, apatosaurus, excelsus, originally, classified, as, brontosaurus, excelsus, had, enough, morphological, differences, from, other, species, of, apatosaurus, that, it, warranted, being, reclassified, as, a, separate, genus, again, the, conclusion, was, based, on, a, comparison, of, 477, morphological, characteristics, across, 81, different, dinosaur, individuals, among, the, many, notable, differences, are, the, wider, and, presumably, stronger, neck, of, apatosaurus, species, compared, to, b, excelsus, other, species, previously, assigned, to, apatosaurus, such, as, elosaurus, parvus, and, eobrontosaurus, yahnahpin, were, also, reclassified, as, brontosaurus, some, features, proposed, to, separate, brontosaurus, from, apatosaurus, include, posterior, dorsal, vertebrae, with, the, centrum, longer, than, wide, the, scapula, rear, to, the, acromial, edge, and, the, distal, blade, being, excavated, the, acromial, edge, of, the, distal, scapular, blade, bearing, a, rounded, expansion, and, the, ratio, of, the, proximodistal, length, to, transverse, breadth, of, the, astragalus, 0, 55, or, greater, sauropod, expert, michael, d, emic, pointed, out, that, the, criteria, chosen, were, to, an, extent, arbitrary, and, that, they, would, require, abandoning, the, name, brontosaurus, again, if, newer, analyzes, obtained, different, results, mammal, paleontologist, donald, prothero, criticized, the, mass, media, reaction, to, this, study, as, superficial, and, premature, concluding, that, he, would, keep, brontosaurus, in, quotes, and, not, treat, the, name, as, a, valid, genus, many, species, of, apatosaurus, have, been, designated, from, scant, material, marsh, named, as, many, species, as, he, could, which, resulted, in, many, being, based, upon, fragmentary, and, indistinguishable, remains, in, 2005, paul, upchurch, and, colleagues, published, a, study, that, analyzed, the, species, and, specimen, relationships, of, apatosaurus, they, found, that, a, louisae, was, the, most, basal, species, followed, by, fmnh, p25112, and, then, a, polytomy, of, a, ajax, a, parvus, and, a, excelsus, their, analysis, was, revised, and, expanded, with, many, additional, diplodocid, specimens, in, 2015, which, resolved, the, relationships, of, apatosaurus, slightly, differently, and, also, supported, separating, brontosaurus, from, apatosaurus, the, cladogram, below, is, the, result, of, an, analysis, by, tschopp, mateus, and, benson, 2015, the, authors, analyzed, most, diplodocid, type, specimens, separately, to, deduce, which, specimen,

includes, some, of, the, longest, creatures, ever, to, walk, the, earth, including, diplodocus, supersaurus, and, barosaurus, apatosaurus, is, sometimes, classified, in, the, subfamily, apatosaurinae, which, may, also, include, suuwassea, supersaurus, and, brontosaurus, othniel, charles, marsh, described, apatosaurus, as, allied, to, atlantosaurus, within, the, now, defunct, group, atlantosauridae, in, 1878, marsh, raised, his, family, to, the, rank, of, suborder, including, apatosaurus, atlantosaurus, morosaurus, camarasaurus, and, diplodocus, he, classified, this, group, within, sauropoda, a, group, he, erected, in, the, same, study, in, 1903, elmer, s, riggs, said, the, name, sauropoda, would, be, a, junior, synonym, of, earlier, names, he, grouped, apatosaurus, within, opisthocoelia, sauropoda, is, still, used, as, the, group, name, in, 2011, john, whitlock, published, a, study, that, placed, apatosaurus, a, more, basal, diplodocid, sometimes, less, basal, than, supersaurus, cladogram, of, the, diplodocidae, after, tschopp, mateus, and, benson, 2015, amphicoelias, altus, unnamed, species, apatosaurus, ajax, apatosaurus, louisae, brontosaurus, excelsus, brontosaurus, yahnahpin, brontosaurus, parvus, unnamed, species, tornieria, africana, dinheirosaurus, lourinhanensis, supersaurus, vivianae, leinkupal, laticauda, galeamopus, hayi, diplodocus, carnegii, diplodocus, hallorum, kaatedocus, siberi, barosaurus, lentus, it, was, believed, throughout, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, that, sauropods, like, apatosaurus, were, too, massive, to, support, their, own, weight, on, dry, land, it, was, theorized, that, they, lived, partly, submerged, in, water, perhaps, in, swamps, more, recent, findings, do, not, support, this, sauropods, are, now, thought, to, have, been, fully, terrestrial, animals, a, study, of, diplodocid, snouts, showed, that, the, square, snout, large, proportion, of, pits, and, fine, subparallel, scratches, of, the, teeth, of, apatosaurus, suggests, it, was, a, ground, height, nonselective, browser, it, may, have, eaten, ferns, cycadeoids, seed, ferns, horsetails, and, algae, stevens, and, parish, 2005, speculate, that, these, sauropods, fed, from, riverbanks, on, submerged, water, plants, a, 2015, study, of, the, necks, of, apatosaurus, and, brontosaurus, found, many, differences, between, them, and, other, diplodocids, and, that, these, variations, may, have, shown, that, the, necks, of, apatosaurus, and, brontosaurus, were, used, for, intraspecific, combat, various, uses, for, the, single, claw, on, the, forelimb, of, sauropods, have, been, proposed, one, suggestion, is, that, they, were, used, for, defense, but, their, shape, and, size, make, this, unlikely, it, was, also, possible, they, were, for, feeding, but, the, most, probable, use, for, the, claw, was, grasping, objects, such, as, tree, trunks, when, rearing, trackways, of, sauropods, like, apatosaurus, show, that, they, may, have, had, a, range, of, around, 25, 40, km, 16, 25, mi, per, day, and, that, they, could, potentially, have, reached, a, top, speed, of, 20, 30, km, 12, 19, mi, per, hour, the, slow, locomotion, of, sauropods, may, be, due, to, their, minimal, muscling, or, to, recoil, after, strides, a, trackway, of, a, juvenile, has, led, some, to, believe, that, they, were, capable, of, bipedalism, though, this, is, disputed, diplodocids, like, apatosaurus, are, often, portrayed, with, their, necks, held, high, up, in, the, air, allowing, them, to, browse, on, tall, trees, some, studies, state, diplodocid, necks, were, less, flexible, than, previously, believed, because, the, structure, of, the, neck, vertebrae, would, not, have, allowed, the, neck, to, bend, far, upward, and, that, sauropods, like, apatosaurus, were, adapted, to, low, browsing, or, ground, feeding, other, studies, by, taylor, find, that, all, tetrapods, appear, to, hold, their, necks, at, the, maximum, possible, vertical, extension, when, in, a, normal, alert, posture, they, argue, the, same, would, hold, true, for, sauropods, barring, any, unknown, unique, characteristics, that, set, the, soft, tissue, anatomy, of, their, necks, apart, from, that, of, other, animals, apatosaurus, like, diplodocus, would, have, held, its, neck, angled, upward, with, the, head, pointing, downward, in, a, resting, posture, kent, stevens, and, michael, parrish, 1999, and, 2005, state, apatosaurus, had, a, great, feeding, range, its, neck, could, bend, into, a, u, shape, laterally, the, neck, s, range, of, movement, would, have, also, allowed, the, head, to, feed, at, the, level, of, the, feet, matthew, cobley, et, al, 2013, dispute, this, finding, that, large, muscles, and, cartilage, would, have, limited, movement, of, the, neck, they, state, the, feeding, ranges, for, sauropods, like, diplodocus, were, smaller, than, previously, believed, and, the, animals, may, have, had, to, move, their, whole, bodies, around, to, better, access, areas, where, they, could, browse, vegetation, as, such, they, might, have, spent, more, time, foraging, to, meet, their, minimum, energy, needs, the, conclusions, of, cobley, et, al, are, disputed, by, taylor, who, analyzed, the, amount, and, positioning, of, intervertebral, cartilage, to, determine, the, flexibility, of, the, neck, of, apatosaurus, and, diplodocus, he, found, that, the, neck, of, apatosaurus, was, very, flexible, given, the, large, body, mass, and, long, neck, of, sauropods, like, apatosaurus, physiologists, have, encountered, problems, determining, how, these, animals, breathed, beginning, with, the, assumption, that, like, crocodilians, apatosaurus, did, not, have, a, diaphragm, the, dead, space, volume, the, amount, of, unused, air, remaining, in, the, mouth, trachea, and, air, tubes, after, each, breath, has, been, estimated, at, about, 0, 184, m, 3, 184, l, for, a, 30, t, 30, long, tons, 33, short, tons, specimen, paladino, calculates, its, tidal, volume, the, amount, of, air, moved, in, or, out, during, a, single, breath, at, 0, 904, m, 3, 904, l, with, an, avian, respiratory, system, 0, 225, m, 3, 225, l, if, mammalian, and, 0, 019, m, 3, 19, l, if, reptilian, on, this, basis, its, respiratory, system, would, likely, have, been, parabronchi, with, multiple, pulmonary, air, sacs, as, in, avian, lungs, and, a, flow, through, lung, an, avian, respiratory, system, would, need, a, lung, volume, of, about, 0, 60, m, 3, 600, l, compared, with, a, mammalian, requirement, of, 2, 95, m, 3, 2, 950, l, which, would, exceed, the, space, available, the, overall, thoracic, volume, of, apatosaurus, has, been, estimated, at, 1, 7, m, 3, 1, 700, l, allowing, for, a, 0, 50, m, 3, 500, l, four, chambered, heart, and, a, 0, 90, m, 3, 900, l, lung, capacity, that, would, allow, about, 0, 30, m, 3, 300, l, for, the, necessary, tissue, evidence, for, the, avian, system, in, apatosaurus, and, other, sauropods, is, also, present, in, the, pneumaticity, of, the, vertebrae, though, this, plays, a, role, in, reducing, the, weight, of, the, animal, wedel, 2003, states, they, are, also, likely, connected, to, air, sacs, as, in, birds, james, spotila, et, al, 1991, concludes, that, the, large, body, size, of, sauropods, would, have, made, them, unable, to, maintain, high, metabolic, rates, because, they, would, not, have, been, able, to, release, enough, heat, they, assumed, sauropods, had, a, reptilian, respiratory, system, wedel, says, that, an, avian, system, would, have, allowed, it, to, dump, more, heat, some, scientists, state, that, the, heart, would, have, had, trouble, sustaining, sufficient, blood, pressure, to, oxygenate, the, brain, others, suggest, that, the, near, horizontal, posture, of, the, head, and, neck, would, have, eliminated, the, problem, of, supplying, blood, to, the, brain, because, it, would, not, have, been, elevated, james, farlow, 1987, calculates, that, an, apatosaurus, sized, dinosaur, about, 35, t, 34, long, tons, 39, short, tons, would, have, possessed, 5, 7, t, 5, 6, long, tons, 6, 3, short, tons, of, fermentation, contents, though, he, cautions, that, the, regression, equation, being, used, is, based, on, living, mammals, which, are, much, smaller, and, physiologically, different, assuming, apatosaurus, had, an, avian, respiratory, system, and, a, reptilian, resting, metabolism, frank, paladino, et, al, 1997, estimate, the, animal, would, have, needed, to, consume, only, about, 262, litres, 58, imp, gal, 69, us, gal, of, water, per, day, a, 1999, microscopic, study, of, apatosaurus, and, brontosaurus, bones, concluded, the, animals, grew, rapidly, when, young, and, reached, near, adult, sizes, in, about, 10, years, in, 2008, a, study, on, the, growth, rates, of, sauropods, was, published, by, thomas, lehman, and, holly, woodward, they, said, that, by, using, growth, lines, and, length, to, mass, ratios, apatosaurus, would, have, grown, to, 25, t, 25, long, tons, 28, short, tons, in, 15, years, with, growth, peaking, at, 5, 000, kg, 11, 000, lb, in, a, single, year, an, alternative, method, using, limb, length, and, body, mass, found, apatosaurus, grew, 520, kg, 1, 150, lb, per, year, and, reached, its, full, mass, before, it, was, about, 70, years, old, these, estimates, have, been, called, unreliable, because, the, calculation, methods, are, not, sound, old, growth, lines, would, have, been, obliterated, by, bone, remodeling, one, of, the, first, identified, growth, factors, of, apatosaurus, was, the, number, of, sacral, vertebrae, which, increased, to, five, by, the, time, of, the, creature, s, maturity, this, was, first, noted, in, 1903, and, again, in, 1936, long, bone, histology, enables, researchers, to, estimate, the, age, that, a, specific, individual, reached, a, study, by, eva, griebeler, et, al, 2013, examined, long, bone, histological, data, and, concluded, the, apatosaurus, sp, sma, 0014, weighed, 20, 206, kg, 22, 3, short, tons, reached, sexual, maturity, at, 21, years, and, died, aged, 28, the, same, growth, model, indicated, apatosaurus, sp, byu, 601, 17328, weighed, 18, 178, kg, 20, 0, short, tons, reached, sexual, maturity, at, 19, years, and, died, aged, 31, compared, with, most, sauropods, a, relatively, large, amount, of, juvenile, material, is, known, from, apatosaurus, multiple, specimens, in, the, omnh, are, from, juveniles, of, an, undetermined, species, of, apatosaurus, this, material, includes, partial, shoulder, and, pelvic, girdles, some, vertebrae, and, limb, bones, omnh, juvenile, material, is, from, at, least, two, different, age, groups, and, based, on, overlapping, bones, likely, comes, from, more, than, three, individuals, the, specimens, exhibit, features, that, distinguish, apatosaurus, from, its, relatives, and, thus, likely, belong, to, the, genus, juvenile, sauropods, tend, to, have, proportionally, shorter, necks, and, tails, and, a, more, pronounced, forelimb, hindlimb, disparity, than, found, in, adult, sauropods, an, article, published, in, 1997, reported, research, of, the, mechanics, of, apatosaurus, tails, by, nathan, myhrvold, and, paleontologist, philip, j, currie, myhrvold, carried, out, a, computer, simulation, of, the, tail, which, in, diplodocids, like, apatosaurus, was, a, very, long, tapering, structure, resembling, a, bullwhip, this, computer, modeling, suggested, diplodocids, were, capable, of, producing, a, whiplike, cracking, sound, of, over, 200, decibels, comparable, to, the, volume, of, a, cannon, being, fired, a, pathology, has, been, identified, on, the, tail, of, apatosaurus, caused, by, a, growth, defect, two, caudal, vertebrae, are, seamlessly, fused, along, the, entire, articulating, surface, of, the, bone, including, the, arches, of, the, neural, spines, this, defect, might, have, been, caused, by, the, lack, or, inhibition, of, the, substance, that, forms, intervertebral, disks, or, joints, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, whips, could, have, been, used, in, combat, and, defense, but, the, tails, of, diplodocids, were, quite, light, and, narrow, compared, to, shunosaurus, and, mamenchisaurids, and, thus, to, injure, another, animal, with, the, tail, would, severely, injure, the, tail, itself, more, recently, baron, 2020, considers, the, use, of, the, tail, as, a, bullwhip, unlikely, because, of, the, potentially, catastrophic, muscle, and, skeletal, damage, such, speeds, could, cause, on, the, large, and, heavy, tail, instead, he, proposes, that, the, tails, might, have, been, used, as, a, tactile, organ, to, keep, in, touch, with, the, individuals, behind, and, on, the, sides, in, a, group, while, migrating, which, could, have, augmented, cohesion, and, allowed, communication, among, individuals, while, limiting, more, energetically, demanding, activities, like, stopping, to, search, for, dispersed, individuals, turning, to, visually, check, on, individuals, behind, or, communicating, vocally, the, morrison, formation, is, a, sequence, of, shallow, marine, and, alluvial, sediments, which, according, to, radiometric, dating, dates, from, between, 156, 3, mya, at, its, base, and, 146, 8, mya, at, the, top, placing, it, in, the, late, oxfordian, kimmeridgian, and, early, tithonian, stages, of, the, late, jurassic, period, this, formation, is, interpreted, as, originating, in, a, locally, semiarid, environment, with, distinct, wet, and, dry, seasons, the, morrison, basin, where, dinosaurs, lived, stretched, from, new, mexico, to, alberta, and, saskatchewan, it, was, formed, when, the, precursors, to, the, front, range, of, the, rocky, mountains, started, pushing, up, to, the, west, the, deposits, from, their, east, facing, drainage, basins, were, carried, by, streams, and, rivers, and, deposited, in, swampy, lowlands, lakes, river, channels, and, floodplains, this, formation, is, similar, in, age, to, the, lourinh, formation, in, portugal, and, the, tendaguru, formation, in, tanzania, apatosaurus, was, the, second, most, common, sauropod, in, the, morrison, formation, ecosystem, after, camarasaurus, apatosaurus, may, have, been, more, solitary, than, other, morrison, formation, dinosaurs, fossils, of, the, genus, have, only, been, found, in, the, upper, levels, of, the, formation, those, of, apatosaurus, ajax, are, known, exclusively, from, the, upper, brushy, basin, member, about, 152, 151, mya, a, louisae, fossils, are, rare, known, only, from, one, site, in, the, upper, brushy, basin, member, they, date, to, the, late, kimmeridgian, stage, about, 151, mya, additional, apatosaurus, remains, are, known, from, similarly, aged, or, slightly, younger, rocks, but, they, have, not, been, identified, as, any, particular, species, and, thus, may, instead, belong, to, brontosaurus, the, morrison, formation, records, a, time, when, the, local, environment, was, dominated, by, gigantic, sauropod, dinosaurs, dinosaurs, known, from, the, morrison, formation, include, the, theropods, allosaurus, ceratosaurus, ornitholestes, saurophaganax, and, torvosaurus, the, sauropods, brontosaurus, brachiosaurus, camarasaurus, and, diplodocus, and, the, ornithischians, camptosaurus, dryosaurus, and, stegosaurus, apatosaurus, is, commonly, found, at, the, same, sites, as, allosaurus, camarasaurus, diplodocus, and, stegosaurus, allosaurus, accounted, for, 70, 75, of, theropod, specimens, and, was, at, the, top, trophic, level, of, the, morrison, food, web, many, of, the, dinosaurs, of, the, morrison, formation, are, of, the, same, genera, as, those, seen, in, portuguese, rocks, of, the, lourinh, formation, mainly, allosaurus, ceratosaurus, and, torvosaurus, or, have, a, close, counterpart, brachiosaurus, and, lusotitan, camptosaurus, and, draconyx, and, apatosaurus, and, dinheirosaurus, other, vertebrates, that, are, known, to, have, shared, this, paleo, environment, include, ray, finned, fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial, and, aquatic, crocodylomorphs, and, several, species, of, pterosaur, shells, of, bivalves, and, aquatic, snails, are, also, common, the, flora, of, the, period, has, been, evidenced, in, fossils, of, green, algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and, several, families, of, conifers, vegetation, varied, from, river, lining, forests, of, tree, ferns, with, fern, understory, gallery, forests, to, fern, savannas, with, occasional, trees, such, as, the, araucaria, like, conifer, brachyphyllum
