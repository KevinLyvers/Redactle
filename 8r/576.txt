vipera, berus, also, known, as, the, common, european, adder, and, the, common, european, viper, is, a, species, of, venomous, snake, in, the, family, viperidae, the, species, is, extremely, widespread, and, can, be, found, throughout, much, of, europe, and, as, far, as, east, asia, there, are, three, recognised, subspecies, known, by, a, host, of, common, names, including, common, adder, and, common, viper, the, adder, has, been, the, subject, of, much, folklore, in, britain, and, other, european, countries, it, is, not, regarded, as, especially, dangerous, the, snake, is, not, aggressive, and, usually, bites, only, when, really, provoked, stepped, on, or, picked, up, bites, can, be, very, painful, but, are, seldom, fatal, the, specific, name, berus, is, neo, latin, and, was, at, one, time, used, to, refer, to, a, snake, possibly, the, grass, snake, natrix, natrix, the, common, adder, is, found, in, different, terrains, habitat, complexity, being, essential, for, different, aspects, of, its, behaviour, it, feeds, on, small, mammals, birds, lizards, and, amphibians, and, in, some, cases, on, spiders, worms, and, insects, the, common, adder, like, most, other, vipers, is, ovoviviparous, females, breed, once, every, two, or, three, years, with, litters, usually, being, born, in, late, summer, to, early, autumn, in, the, northern, hemisphere, litters, range, in, size, from, three, to, 20, with, young, staying, with, their, mothers, for, a, few, days, adults, grow, to, a, total, length, including, tail, of, 60, to, 90, cm, 24, to, 35, in, and, a, mass, of, 50, to, 180, g, 1, 8, to, 6, 3, oz, three, subspecies, are, recognised, including, the, nominate, subspecies, vipera, berus, berus, described, here, the, snake, is, not, considered, to, be, threatened, though, it, is, protected, in, some, countries, there, are, three, subspecies, of, v, berus, that, are, recognised, as, being, valid, including, the, nominotypical, subspecies, the, subspecies, v, b, bosniensis, and, v, b, sachalinensis, have, been, regarded, as, full, species, in, some, recent, publications, the, name, adder, is, derived, from, n, dre, an, old, english, word, that, had, the, generic, meaning, of, serpent, in, the, older, forms, of, many, germanic, languages, it, was, commonly, used, in, the, old, english, version, of, the, christian, scriptures, for, the, devil, and, the, serpent, in, the, book, of, genesis, in, the, 14th, century, a, nadder, in, middle, english, was, rebracketed, to, an, adder, just, as, a, napron, became, an, apron, and, a, nompere, changed, into, an, umpire, in, keeping, with, its, wide, distribution, and, familiarity, through, the, ages, vipera, berus, has, a, large, number, of, common, names, in, english, which, include, in, denmark, norway, and, sweden, the, snake, is, known, as, hugorm, hoggorm, and, huggorm, roughly, translated, as, striking, snake, in, finland, it, is, known, as, kyyk, rme, or, simply, kyy, in, estonia, it, is, known, as, r, stik, while, in, lithuania, it, is, known, as, angis, in, poland, the, snake, is, called, mija, zygzakowata, which, translates, as, zigzag, viper, due, to, the, pattern, on, its, back, relatively, thick, bodied, adults, usually, grow, to, 60, cm, 24, in, in, total, length, including, tail, with, an, average, of, 55, cm, 22, in, maximum, size, varies, by, region, the, largest, at, over, 90, cm, 35, in, are, found, in, scandinavia, specimens, of, 104, cm, 41, in, have, been, observed, there, on, two, occasions, in, france, and, great, britain, the, maximum, size, is, 80, 87, cm, 31, 34, in, mass, ranges, from, 50, g, 1, 8, oz, to, about, 180, grams, 6, 3, oz, the, head, is, fairly, large, and, distinct, and, its, sides, are, almost, flat, and, vertical, the, edge, of, the, snout, is, usually, raised, into, a, low, ridge, seen, from, above, the, rostral, scale, is, not, visible, or, only, just, immediately, behind, the, rostral, there, are, two, rarely, one, small, scales, dorsally, there, are, usually, five, large, plates, a, squarish, frontal, longer, than, wide, sometimes, rectangular, two, parietals, sometimes, with, a, tiny, scale, between, the, frontal, and, the, parietals, and, two, long, and, narrow, supraoculars, the, latter, are, large, and, distinct, each, separated, from, the, frontal, by, one, to, four, small, scales, the, nostril, is, situated, in, a, shallow, depression, within, a, large, nasal, scale, the, eye, is, relatively, large, equal, in, size, or, slightly, larger, than, the, nasal, scale, but, often, smaller, in, females, below, the, supraoculars, are, six, to, 13, usually, eight, to, 10, small, circumorbital, scales, the, temporal, scales, are, smooth, rarely, weakly, keeled, there, are, 10, 12, sublabials, and, six, to, 10, usually, eight, or, 9, supralabials, of, the, latter, the, numbers, 3, and, 4, are, the, largest, while, 4, and, 5, rarely, 3, and, 4, are, separated, from, the, eye, by, a, single, row, of, small, scales, sometimes, two, rows, in, alpine, specimens, midbody, there, are, 21, dorsal, scales, rows, rarely, 19, 20, 22, or, 23, these, are, strongly, keeled, scales, except, for, those, bordering, the, ventral, scales, these, scales, seem, loosely, attached, to, the, skin, and, lower, rows, become, increasingly, wide, those, closest, to, the, ventral, scales, are, twice, as, wide, as, the, ones, along, the, midline, the, ventral, scales, number, 132, 150, in, males, and, 132, 158, in, females, the, anal, plate, is, single, the, subcaudals, are, paired, numbering, 32, 46, in, males, and, 23, 38, in, females, the, colour, pattern, varies, ranging, from, very, light, coloured, specimens, with, small, incomplete, dark, dorsal, crossbars, to, entirely, brown, ones, with, faint, or, clear, darker, brown, markings, and, on, to, melanistic, individuals, that, are, entirely, dark, and, lack, any, apparent, dorsal, pattern, however, most, have, some, kind, of, zigzag, dorsal, pattern, down, the, entire, length, of, their, bodies, and, tails, the, head, usually, has, a, distinctive, dark, v, or, x, on, the, back, a, dark, streak, runs, from, the, eye, to, the, neck, and, continues, as, a, longitudinal, series, of, spots, along, the, flanks, unusually, for, snakes, it, is, often, possible, to, distinguish, the, sexes, by, their, colour, females, are, usually, brownish, in, hue, with, dark, brown, markings, the, males, are, pure, grey, with, black, markings, the, basal, colour, of, males, will, often, be, slightly, lighter, than, that, of, the, females, making, the, black, zigzag, pattern, stand, out, the, melanistic, individuals, are, often, females, vipera, berus, has, a, wide, range, it, can, be, found, across, the, eurasian, land, mass, from, northwestern, europe, great, britain, belgium, netherlands, scandinavia, germany, france, across, southern, europe, italy, serbia, albania, croatia, montenegro, bosnia, and, herzegovina, north, macedonia, bulgaria, and, northern, greece, and, eastern, europe, to, north, of, the, arctic, circle, and, russia, to, the, pacific, ocean, sakhalin, island, north, korea, northern, mongolia, and, northern, china, it, is, found, farther, north, than, any, other, snake, species, the, type, locality, was, originally, listed, as, europa, mertens, and, m, ller, 1940, proposed, restricting, the, type, locality, to, uppsala, sweden, and, it, was, eventually, restricted, to, berth, ga, uppsala, by, designation, of, a, neotype, by, krecs, k, wahlgren, 2008, in, several, european, countries, it, is, notable, as, being, the, only, native, venomous, snake, it, is, one, of, only, three, snake, species, native, to, britain, the, other, two, the, barred, grass, snake, and, the, smooth, snake, are, non, venomous, sufficient, habitat, complexity, is, a, crucial, requirement, for, the, presence, of, this, species, in, order, to, support, its, various, behaviours, basking, foraging, and, hibernation, as, well, as, to, offer, some, protection, from, predators, and, human, harassment, it, is, found, in, a, variety, of, habitats, including, chalky, downs, rocky, hillsides, moors, sandy, heaths, meadows, rough, commons, edges, of, woods, sunny, glades, and, clearings, bushy, slopes, and, hedgerows, dumps, coastal, dunes, and, stone, quarries, it, will, venture, into, wetlands, if, dry, ground, is, available, nearby, and, thus, may, be, found, on, the, banks, of, streams, lakes, and, ponds, in, much, of, southern, europe, such, as, southern, france, and, northern, italy, it, is, found, in, either, low, lying, wetlands, or, at, high, altitudes, in, the, swiss, alps, it, may, ascend, to, about, 3, 000, m, 9, 800, ft, in, hungary, and, russia, it, avoids, open, steppeland, a, habitat, in, which, v, ursinii, is, more, likely, to, occur, in, russia, however, it, does, occur, in, the, forest, steppe, zone, in, great, britain, it, is, illegal, to, kill, injure, harm, or, sell, adders, under, the, wildlife, and, countryside, act, 1981, the, same, situation, applies, to, norway, under, the, viltloven, the, wildlife, act, 1981, and, denmark, 1981, in, finland, nature, conservation, act, 9, 2023, killing, an, adder, is, legal, if, it, s, not, possible, to, capture, and, transfer, it, to, another, location, and, the, same, provisions, also, exists, in, sweden, the, common, viper, is, categorised, as, endangered, in, switzerland, and, is, also, protected, in, some, other, countries, in, its, range, it, is, also, found, in, many, protected, areas, this, species, is, listed, as, protected, appendix, iii, under, the, berne, convention, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, red, list, of, threatened, species, describes, the, conservation, status, as, of, least, concern, in, view, of, its, wide, distribution, presumed, large, population, broad, range, of, habitats, and, likely, slow, rate, of, decline, though, it, acknowledges, the, population, to, be, decreasing, reduction, in, habitat, for, a, variety, of, reasons, fragmentation, of, populations, in, europe, due, to, intense, agriculture, practices, and, collection, for, the, pet, trade, or, for, venom, extraction, have, been, recorded, as, major, contributing, factors, for, its, decline, a, citizen, science, based, survey, in, the, uk, found, evidence, of, extensive, population, declines, in, the, uk, especially, affecting, smaller, populations, a, combination, of, public, pressure, and, disturbance, habitat, fragmentation, and, poor, habitat, management, were, considered, the, most, likely, causes, of, the, decline, the, release, of, 47, million, non, native, pheasants, and, 10, million, partridges, each, year, by, countryside, estates, has, also, been, suggested, to, have, a, significant, impact, on, adder, populations, across, the, uk, with, the, possibility, the, reptile, could, be, extinct, by, 2032, this, species, is, mainly, diurnal, especially, in, the, north, of, its, range, further, south, it, is, said, to, be, active, in, the, evening, and, it, may, even, be, active, at, night, during, the, summer, months, it, is, predominantly, a, terrestrial, species, although, it, has, been, known, to, climb, up, banks, and, into, low, bushes, in, order, to, bask, or, search, for, prey, adders, are, not, usually, aggressive, tending, to, be, rather, timid, and, biting, only, when, cornered, or, alarmed, people, are, generally, bitten, only, after, stepping, on, them, or, attempting, to, pick, them, up, they, will, usually, disappear, into, the, undergrowth, at, a, hint, of, any, danger, but, will, return, once, all, is, quiet, often, to, the, same, spot, occasionally, individual, snakes, will, reveal, their, presence, with, a, loud, and, sustained, hissing, presumably, to, warn, off, potential, aggressors, often, these, turn, out, to, be, pregnant, females, when, the, adder, is, threatened, the, front, part, of, the, body, is, drawn, into, an, s, shape, to, prepare, for, a, strike, the, species, is, cold, adapted, and, hibernates, in, the, winter, in, great, britain, males, and, females, hibernate, for, about, 150, and, 180, days, respectively, in, northern, sweden, hibernation, lasts, 8, 9, months, on, mild, winter, days, they, may, emerge, to, bask, where, the, snow, has, melted, and, will, often, travel, across, snow, about, 15, of, adults, and, 30, 40, of, juveniles, die, during, hibernation, their, diet, consists, mainly, of, small, mammals, such, as, mice, rats, voles, and, shrews, as, well, as, lizards, sometimes, slow, worms, are, taken, and, even, weasels, and, moles, adders, also, feed, on, amphibians, such, as, frogs, newts, and, salamanders, birds, are, also, reported, to, be, consumed, especially, nestlings, and, even, eggs, for, which, they, will, climb, into, shrubbery, and, bushes, generally, diet, varies, depending, on, locality, juveniles, will, eat, nestling, mammals, small, lizards, and, frogs, as, well, as, worms, and, spiders, one, important, dietary, source, for, young, adders, is, the, alpine, salamander, salamadra, atra, because, both, species, live, at, higher, altitudes, s, atra, could, be, a, prevalent, food, source, for, adders, since, there, may, be, few, other, animals, one, study, suggests, that, alpine, salamanders, could, consist, of, almost, half, of, the, adders, diets, in, some, locations, they, have, been, witnessed, swallowing, these, salamanders, in, the, early, morning, hours, once, they, reach, about, 30, cm, 0, 98, ft, in, length, their, diet, begins, to, resemble, that, of, the, adults, in, hungary, mating, takes, place, in, the, last, week, of, april, whilst, in, the, north, it, happens, later, in, the, second, week, of, may, mating, has, also, been, observed, in, june, and, even, early, october, but, it, is, not, known, if, this, autumn, mating, results, in, any, offspring, females, often, breed, once, every, two, years, or, even, once, every, three, years, if, the, seasons, are, short, and, the, climate, is, not, conducive, males, find, females, by, following, their, scent, trails, sometimes, tracking, them, for, hundreds, of, metres, a, day, if, a, female, is, found, and, then, flees, the, male, follows, courtship, involves, side, by, side, parallel, flowing, behaviour, tongue, flicking, along, the, back, and, excited, lashing, of, the, tail, pairs, stay, together, for, one, or, two, days, after, mating, males, chase, away, their, rivals, and, engage, in, combat, often, this, also, starts, with, the, aforementioned, flowing, behaviour, before, culminating, in, the, dramatic, adder, dance, in, this, act, the, males, confront, each, other, raise, up, the, front, part, of, the, body, vertically, make, swaying, movements, and, attempt, to, push, each, other, to, the, ground, this, is, repeated, until, one, of, the, two, becomes, exhausted, and, crawls, off, to, find, another, mate, appleby, 1971, notes, that, he, has, never, seen, an, intruder, win, one, of, these, contests, as, if, the, frustrated, defender, is, so, aroused, by, courtship, that, he, refuses, to, lose, his, chance, to, mate, there, is, no, record, of, any, biting, taking, place, during, these, bouts, females, usually, give, birth, in, august, or, september, but, sometimes, as, early, as, july, or, as, late, as, early, october, litters, range, in, size, from, 3, to, 20, the, young, are, usually, born, encased, in, a, transparent, sac, from, which, they, must, free, themselves, sometimes, they, succeed, in, freeing, themselves, from, this, membrane, while, still, inside, the, female, neonates, measure, 14, to, 23, cm, 5, 5, to, 9, 1, in, in, total, length, including, tail, with, an, average, total, length, of, 17, cm, 6, 7, in, they, are, born, with, a, fully, functional, venom, apparatus, and, a, reserve, supply, of, yolk, within, their, bodies, they, shed, their, skins, for, the, first, time, within, a, day, or, two, females, do, not, appear, to, take, much, interest, in, their, offspring, but, the, young, have, been, observed, to, remain, near, their, mothers, for, several, days, after, birth, because, of, the, rapid, rate, of, human, expansion, throughout, the, range, of, this, species, bites, are, relatively, common, domestic, animals, and, livestock, are, frequent, victims, in, great, britain, most, instances, occur, in, march, october, in, sweden, there, are, about, 1, 300, bites, a, year, with, an, estimated, 12, that, require, hospitalisation, at, least, eight, different, antivenoms, are, available, against, bites, from, this, species, mallow, et, al, 2003, describe, the, venom, toxicity, as, being, relatively, low, compared, to, other, viper, species, they, cite, minton, 1974, who, reported, the, ld, 50, values, for, mice, to, be, 0, 55, mg, kg, iv, 0, 80, mg, kg, ip, and, 6, 45, mg, kg, sc, as, a, comparison, in, one, test, the, minimum, lethal, dose, of, venom, for, a, guinea, pig, was, 40, 67, mg, but, only, 1, 7, mg, was, necessary, when, daboia, russelii, venom, was, used, brown, 1973, gives, a, higher, subcutaneous, ld, 50, range, of, 1, 0, 4, 0, mg, kg, all, agree, that, the, venom, yield, is, low, minton, 1974, mentions, 10, 18, mg, for, specimens, 48, 62, cm, 19, 24, 5, in, in, length, while, brown, 1973, lists, only, 6, mg, relatively, speaking, bites, from, this, species, are, not, highly, dangerous, in, britain, there, were, only, 14, known, fatalities, between, 1876, and, 2005, the, last, a, 5, year, old, child, in, 1975, and, one, nearly, fatal, bite, of, a, 39, year, old, woman, in, essex, in, 1998, an, 82, year, old, woman, died, following, a, bite, in, germany, in, 2004, although, it, is, not, clear, whether, her, death, was, due, to, the, effect, of, the, venom, a, 44, year, old, british, man, was, left, seriously, ill, after, he, was, bitten, by, an, adder, in, the, dalby, forest, yorkshire, in, 2014, even, so, professional, medical, help, should, always, be, sought, as, soon, as, possible, after, any, bite, very, occasionally, bites, can, be, life, threatening, particularly, in, small, children, while, adults, may, experience, discomfort, and, disability, long, after, the, bite, the, length, of, recovery, varies, but, may, take, up, to, a, year, local, symptoms, include, immediate, and, intense, pain, followed, after, a, few, minutes, but, perhaps, by, as, much, as, 30, minutes, by, swelling, and, a, tingling, sensation, blisters, containing, blood, are, not, common, the, pain, may, spread, within, a, few, hours, along, with, tenderness, and, inflammation, reddish, lymphangitic, lines, and, bruising, may, appear, and, the, whole, limb, can, become, swollen, and, bruised, within, 24, hours, swelling, may, also, spread, to, the, trunk, and, with, children, throughout, the, entire, body, necrosis, and, intracompartmental, syndromes, are, very, rare, systemic, symptoms, resulting, from, anaphylaxis, can, be, dramatic, these, may, appear, within, 5, minutes, post, bite, or, can, be, delayed, for, many, hours, such, symptoms, include, nausea, retching, and, vomiting, abdominal, colic, and, diarrhoea, incontinence, of, urine, and, faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss, of, consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema, of, the, face, lips, gums, tongue, throat, and, epiglottis, urticaria, and, bronchospasm, if, left, untreated, these, symptoms, may, persist, or, fluctuate, for, up, to, 48, hours, in, severe, cases, cardiovascular, failure, may, occur, adders, were, believed, to, be, deaf, which, is, mentioned, in, psalm, 58, v, 4, but, snake, oil, made, from, them, was, used, as, a, cure, for, deafness, and, earache, females, were, thought, to, swallow, their, young, when, threatened, and, regurgitate, them, unharmed, later, it, was, believed, that, they, did, not, die, until, sunset, remedies, for, adder, stings, included, killing, the, snake, responsible, and, rubbing, the, corpse, or, its, fat, on, the, wound, also, holding, a, pigeon, or, chicken, on, the, bite, or, jumping, over, water, adders, were, thought, to, be, attracted, to, hazel, trees, and, repelled, by, ash, trees, druids, believed, that, large, frenzied, gatherings, of, adders, occurred, in, spring, at, the, centre, of, which, could, be, found, a, polished, rock, called, an, adder, stone, or, glain, neidr, in, the, welsh, language, these, stones, were, said, to, have, held, supernatural, powers
