in, cell, biology, the, meristem, is, a, type, of, tissue, found, in, plants, it, consists, of, undifferentiated, cells, meristematic, cells, capable, of, cell, division, cells, in, the, meristem, can, develop, into, all, the, other, tissues, and, organs, that, occur, in, plants, these, cells, continue, to, divide, until, they, become, differentiated, and, lose, the, ability, to, divide, differentiated, plant, cells, generally, cannot, divide, or, produce, cells, of, a, different, type, meristematic, cells, are, undifferentiated, or, incompletely, differentiated, they, are, totipotent, and, capable, of, continued, cell, division, division, of, meristematic, cells, provides, new, cells, for, expansion, and, differentiation, of, tissues, and, the, initiation, of, new, organs, providing, the, basic, structure, of, the, plant, body, the, cells, are, small, with, small, vacuoles, or, none, and, protoplasm, filling, the, cell, completely, the, plastids, chloroplasts, or, chromoplasts, are, undifferentiated, but, are, present, in, rudimentary, form, proplastids, meristematic, cells, are, packed, closely, together, without, intercellular, spaces, the, cell, wall, is, a, very, thin, primary, cell, wall, the, term, meristem, was, first, used, in, 1858, by, swiss, botanist, carl, wilhelm, von, n, geli, 1817, 1891, in, his, book, beitr, ge, zur, wissenschaftlichen, botanik, contributions, to, scientific, botany, it, is, derived, from, greek, merizein, to, divide, in, recognition, of, its, inherent, function, there, are, three, types, of, meristematic, tissues, apical, at, the, tips, intercalary, or, basal, in, the, middle, and, lateral, at, the, sides, also, known, as, cambium, at, the, meristem, summit, there, is, a, small, group, of, slowly, dividing, cells, which, is, commonly, called, the, central, zone, cells, of, this, zone, have, a, stem, cell, function, and, are, essential, for, meristem, maintenance, the, proliferation, and, growth, rates, at, the, meristem, summit, usually, differ, considerably, from, those, at, the, periphery, apical, meristems, give, rise, to, the, primary, plant, body, and, are, responsible, for, primary, growth, or, an, increase, in, length, or, height, apical, meristems, may, differentiate, into, three, kinds, of, primary, meristem, after, the, primary, growth, lateral, meristems, develop, as, secondary, plant, growth, this, growth, adds, to, the, plant, in, diameter, from, the, established, stem, but, not, all, plants, exhibit, secondary, growth, there, are, two, types, of, secondary, meristems, the, vascular, cambium, and, the, cork, cambium, apical, meristems, are, the, completely, undifferentiated, indeterminate, meristems, in, a, plant, these, differentiate, into, three, kinds, of, primary, meristems, the, primary, meristems, in, turn, produce, the, two, secondary, meristem, types, these, secondary, meristems, are, also, known, as, lateral, meristems, as, they, are, involved, in, lateral, growth, there, are, two, types, of, apical, meristem, tissue, shoot, apical, meristem, sam, which, gives, rise, to, organs, like, the, leaves, and, flowers, and, root, apical, meristem, ram, which, provides, the, meristematic, cells, for, future, root, growth, sam, and, ram, cells, divide, rapidly, and, are, considered, indeterminate, in, that, they, do, not, possess, any, defined, end, status, in, that, sense, the, meristematic, cells, are, frequently, compared, to, the, stem, cells, in, animals, which, have, an, analogous, behavior, and, function, the, apical, meristems, are, layered, where, the, number, of, layers, varies, according, to, plant, type, in, general, the, outermost, layer, is, called, the, tunica, while, the, innermost, layers, are, the, corpus, in, monocots, the, tunica, determines, the, physical, characteristics, of, the, leaf, edge, and, margin, in, dicots, layer, two, of, the, corpus, determines, the, characteristics, of, the, edge, of, the, leaf, the, corpus, and, tunica, play, a, critical, part, of, the, plant, physical, appearance, as, all, plant, cells, are, formed, from, the, meristems, apical, meristems, are, found, in, two, locations, the, root, and, the, stem, some, arctic, plants, have, an, apical, meristem, in, the, lower, middle, parts, of, the, plant, it, is, thought, that, this, kind, of, meristem, evolved, because, it, is, advantageous, in, arctic, conditions, shoot, apical, meristems, are, the, source, of, all, above, ground, organs, such, as, leaves, and, flowers, cells, at, the, shoot, apical, meristem, summit, serve, as, stem, cells, to, the, surrounding, peripheral, region, where, they, proliferate, rapidly, and, are, incorporated, into, differentiating, leaf, or, flower, primordia, the, shoot, apical, meristem, is, the, site, of, most, of, the, embryogenesis, in, flowering, plants, primordia, of, leaves, sepals, petals, stamens, and, ovaries, are, initiated, here, at, the, rate, of, one, every, time, interval, called, a, plastochron, it, is, where, the, first, indications, that, flower, development, has, been, evoked, are, manifested, one, of, these, indications, might, be, the, loss, of, apical, dominance, and, the, release, of, otherwise, dormant, cells, to, develop, as, auxiliary, shoot, meristems, in, some, species, in, axils, of, primordia, as, close, as, two, or, three, away, from, the, apical, dome, the, shoot, apical, meristem, consists, of, four, distinct, cell, groups, these, four, distinct, zones, are, maintained, by, a, complex, signalling, pathway, in, arabidopsis, thaliana, 3, interacting, clavata, genes, are, required, to, regulate, the, size, of, the, stem, cell, reservoir, in, the, shoot, apical, meristem, by, controlling, the, rate, of, cell, division, clv1, and, clv2, are, predicted, to, form, a, receptor, complex, of, the, lrr, receptor, like, kinase, family, to, which, clv3, is, a, ligand, clv3, shares, some, homology, with, the, esr, proteins, of, maize, with, a, short, 14, amino, acid, region, being, conserved, between, the, proteins, proteins, that, contain, these, conserved, regions, have, been, grouped, into, the, cle, family, of, proteins, clv1, has, been, shown, to, interact, with, several, cytoplasmic, proteins, that, are, most, likely, involved, in, downstream, signalling, for, example, the, clv, complex, has, been, found, to, be, associated, with, rho, rac, small, gtpase, related, proteins, these, proteins, may, act, as, an, intermediate, between, the, clv, complex, and, a, mitogen, activated, protein, kinase, mapk, which, is, often, involved, in, signalling, cascades, kapp, is, a, kinase, associated, protein, phosphatase, that, has, been, shown, to, interact, with, clv1, kapp, is, thought, to, act, as, a, negative, regulator, of, clv1, by, dephosphorylating, it, another, important, gene, in, plant, meristem, maintenance, is, wuschel, shortened, to, wus, which, is, a, target, of, clv, signaling, in, addition, to, positively, regulating, clv, thus, forming, a, feedback, loop, wus, is, expressed, in, the, cells, below, the, stem, cells, of, the, meristem, and, its, presence, prevents, the, differentiation, of, the, stem, cells, clv1, acts, to, promote, cellular, differentiation, by, repressing, wus, activity, outside, of, the, central, zone, containing, the, stem, cells, the, function, of, wus, in, the, shoot, apical, meristem, is, linked, to, the, phytohormone, cytokinin, cytokinin, activates, histidine, kinases, which, then, phosphorylate, histidine, phosphotransfer, proteins, subsequently, the, phosphate, groups, are, transferred, onto, two, types, of, arabidopsis, response, regulators, arrs, type, b, arrs, and, type, a, arrs, type, b, arrs, work, as, transcription, factors, to, activate, genes, downstream, of, cytokinin, including, a, arrs, a, arrs, are, similar, to, b, arrs, in, structure, however, a, arrs, do, not, contain, the, dna, binding, domains, that, b, arrs, have, and, which, are, required, to, function, as, transcription, factors, therefore, a, arrs, do, not, contribute, to, the, activation, of, transcription, and, by, competing, for, phosphates, from, phosphotransfer, proteins, inhibit, b, arrs, function, in, the, sam, b, arrs, induce, the, expression, of, wus, which, induces, stem, cell, identity, wus, then, suppresses, a, arrs, as, a, result, b, arrs, are, no, longer, inhibited, causing, sustained, cytokinin, signaling, in, the, center, of, the, shoot, apical, meristem, altogether, with, clavata, signaling, this, system, works, as, a, negative, feedback, loop, cytokinin, signaling, is, positively, reinforced, by, wus, to, prevent, the, inhibition, of, cytokinin, signaling, while, wus, promotes, its, own, inhibitor, in, the, form, of, clv3, which, ultimately, keeps, wus, and, cytokinin, signaling, in, check, unlike, the, shoot, apical, meristem, the, root, apical, meristem, produces, cells, in, two, dimensions, it, harbors, two, pools, of, stem, cells, around, an, organizing, center, called, the, quiescent, center, qc, cells, and, together, produces, most, of, the, cells, in, an, adult, root, at, its, apex, the, root, meristem, is, covered, by, the, root, cap, which, protects, and, guides, its, growth, trajectory, cells, are, continuously, sloughed, off, the, outer, surface, of, the, root, cap, the, qc, cells, are, characterized, by, their, low, mitotic, activity, evidence, suggests, that, the, qc, maintains, the, surrounding, stem, cells, by, preventing, their, differentiation, via, signal, s, that, are, yet, to, be, discovered, this, allows, a, constant, supply, of, new, cells, in, the, meristem, required, for, continuous, root, growth, recent, findings, indicate, that, qc, can, also, act, as, a, reservoir, of, stem, cells, to, replenish, whatever, is, lost, or, damaged, root, apical, meristem, and, tissue, patterns, become, established, in, the, embryo, in, the, case, of, the, primary, root, and, in, the, new, lateral, root, primordium, in, the, case, of, secondary, roots, in, angiosperms, intercalary, sometimes, called, basal, meristems, occur, in, monocot, in, particular, grass, stems, at, the, base, of, nodes, and, leaf, blades, horsetails, and, welwitschia, also, exhibit, intercalary, growth, intercalary, meristems, are, capable, of, cell, division, and, they, allow, for, rapid, growth, and, regrowth, of, many, monocots, intercalary, meristems, at, the, nodes, of, bamboo, allow, for, rapid, stem, elongation, while, those, at, the, base, of, most, grass, leaf, blades, allow, damaged, leaves, to, rapidly, regrow, this, leaf, regrowth, in, grasses, evolved, in, response, to, damage, by, grazing, herbivores, and, or, wildfires, when, plants, begin, flowering, the, shoot, apical, meristem, is, transformed, into, an, inflorescence, meristem, which, goes, on, to, produce, the, floral, meristem, which, produces, the, sepals, petals, stamens, and, carpels, of, the, flower, in, contrast, to, vegetative, apical, meristems, and, some, efflorescence, meristems, floral, meristems, cannot, continue, to, grow, indefinitely, their, growth, is, limited, to, the, flower, with, a, particular, size, and, form, the, transition, from, shoot, meristem, to, floral, meristem, requires, floral, meristem, identity, genes, that, both, specify, the, floral, organs, and, cause, the, termination, of, the, production, of, stem, cells, agamous, ag, is, a, floral, homeotic, gene, required, for, floral, meristem, termination, and, necessary, for, proper, development, of, the, stamens, and, carpels, ag, is, necessary, to, prevent, the, conversion, of, floral, meristems, to, inflorescence, shoot, meristems, but, is, identity, gene, leafy, lfy, and, wus, and, is, restricted, to, the, centre, of, the, floral, meristem, or, the, inner, two, whorls, this, way, floral, identity, and, region, specificity, is, achieved, wus, activates, ag, by, binding, to, a, consensus, sequence, in, the, ag, s, second, intron, and, lfy, binds, to, adjacent, recognition, sites, once, ag, is, activated, it, represses, expression, of, wus, leading, to, the, termination, of, the, meristem, through, the, years, scientists, have, manipulated, floral, meristems, for, economic, reasons, an, example, is, the, mutant, tobacco, plant, maryland, mammoth, in, 1936, the, department, of, agriculture, of, switzerland, performed, several, scientific, tests, with, this, plant, maryland, mammoth, is, peculiar, in, that, it, grows, much, faster, than, other, tobacco, plants, apical, dominance, is, where, one, meristem, prevents, or, inhibits, the, growth, of, other, meristems, as, a, result, the, plant, will, have, one, clearly, defined, main, trunk, for, example, in, trees, the, tip, of, the, main, trunk, bears, the, dominant, shoot, meristem, therefore, the, tip, of, the, trunk, grows, rapidly, and, is, not, shadowed, by, branches, if, the, dominant, meristem, is, cut, off, one, or, more, branch, tips, will, assume, dominance, the, branch, will, start, growing, faster, and, the, new, growth, will, be, vertical, over, the, years, the, branch, may, begin, to, look, more, and, more, like, an, extension, of, the, main, trunk, often, several, branches, will, exhibit, this, behavior, after, the, removal, of, apical, meristem, leading, to, a, bushy, growth, the, mechanism, of, apical, dominance, is, based, on, auxins, types, of, plant, growth, regulators, these, are, produced, in, the, apical, meristem, and, transported, towards, the, roots, in, the, cambium, if, apical, dominance, is, complete, they, prevent, any, branches, from, forming, as, long, as, the, apical, meristem, is, active, if, the, dominance, is, incomplete, side, branches, will, develop, recent, investigations, into, apical, dominance, and, the, control, of, branching, have, revealed, a, new, plant, hormone, family, termed, strigolactones, these, compounds, were, previously, known, to, be, involved, in, seed, germination, and, communication, with, mycorrhizal, fungi, and, are, now, shown, to, be, involved, in, inhibition, of, branching, the, sam, contains, a, population, of, stem, cells, that, also, produce, the, lateral, meristems, while, the, stem, elongates, it, turns, out, that, the, mechanism, of, regulation, of, the, stem, cell, number, might, be, evolutionarily, conserved, the, clavata, gene, clv2, responsible, for, maintaining, the, stem, cell, population, in, arabidopsis, thaliana, is, very, closely, related, to, the, maize, gene, fasciated, ear, 2, fea2, also, involved, in, the, same, function, similarly, in, rice, the, fon1, fon2, system, seems, to, bear, a, close, relationship, with, the, clv, signaling, system, in, arabidopsis, thaliana, these, studies, suggest, that, the, regulation, of, stem, cell, number, identity, and, differentiation, might, be, an, evolutionarily, conserved, mechanism, in, monocots, if, not, in, angiosperms, rice, also, contains, another, genetic, system, distinct, from, fon1, fon2, that, is, involved, in, regulating, stem, cell, number, this, example, underlines, the, innovation, that, goes, about, in, the, living, world, all, the, time, genetic, screens, have, identified, genes, belonging, to, the, knox, family, in, this, function, these, genes, essentially, maintain, the, stem, cells, in, an, undifferentiated, state, the, knox, family, has, undergone, quite, a, bit, of, evolutionary, diversification, while, keeping, the, overall, mechanism, more, or, less, similar, members, of, the, knox, family, have, been, found, in, plants, as, diverse, as, arabidopsis, thaliana, rice, barley, and, tomato, knox, like, genes, are, also, present, in, some, algae, mosses, ferns, and, gymnosperms, misexpression, of, these, genes, leads, to, the, formation, of, interesting, morphological, features, for, example, among, members, of, antirrhineae, only, the, species, of, the, genus, antirrhinum, lack, a, structure, called, spur, in, the, floral, region, a, spur, is, considered, an, evolutionary, innovation, because, it, defines, pollinator, specificity, and, attraction, researchers, carried, out, transposon, mutagenesis, in, antirrhinum, majus, and, saw, that, some, insertions, led, to, formation, of, spurs, that, were, very, similar, to, the, other, members, of, antirrhineae, indicating, that, the, loss, of, spur, in, wild, antirrhinum, majus, populations, could, probably, be, an, evolutionary, innovation, the, knox, family, has, also, been, implicated, in, leaf, shape, evolution, see, below, for, a, more, detailed, discussion, one, study, looked, at, the, pattern, of, knox, gene, expression, in, a, thaliana, that, has, simple, leaves, and, cardamine, hirsuta, a, plant, having, complex, leaves, in, a, thaliana, the, knox, genes, are, completely, turned, off, in, leaves, but, in, c, hirsuta, the, expression, continued, generating, complex, leaves, also, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, mechanism, of, knox, gene, action, is, conserved, across, all, vascular, plants, because, there, is, a, tight, correlation, between, knox, expression, and, a, complex, leaf, morphology, though, each, plant, grows, according, to, a, certain, set, of, rules, each, new, root, and, shoot, meristem, can, go, on, growing, for, as, long, as, it, is, alive, in, many, plants, meristematic, growth, is, potentially, indeterminate, making, the, overall, shape, of, the, plant, not, determinate, in, advance, this, is, the, primary, growth, primary, growth, leads, to, lengthening, of, the, plant, body, and, organ, formation, all, plant, organs, arise, ultimately, from, cell, divisions, in, the, apical, meristems, followed, by, cell, expansion, and, differentiation, primary, growth, gives, rise, to, the, apical, part, of, many, plants, the, growth, of, nitrogen, fixing, root, nodules, on, legume, plants, such, as, soybean, and, pea, is, either, determinate, or, indeterminate, thus, soybean, or, bean, and, lotus, japonicus, produce, determinate, nodules, spherical, with, a, branched, vascular, system, surrounding, the, central, infected, zone, often, rhizobium, infected, cells, have, only, small, vacuoles, in, contrast, nodules, on, pea, clovers, and, medicago, truncatula, are, indeterminate, to, maintain, at, least, for, some, time, an, active, meristem, that, yields, new, cells, for, rhizobium, infection, thus, zones, of, maturity, exist, in, the, nodule, infected, cells, usually, possess, a, large, vacuole, the, plant, vascular, system, is, branched, and, peripheral, under, appropriate, conditions, each, shoot, meristem, can, develop, into, a, complete, new, plant, or, clone, such, new, plants, can, be, grown, from, shoot, cuttings, that, contain, an, apical, meristem, root, apical, meristems, are, not, readily, cloned, however, this, cloning, is, called, asexual, reproduction, or, vegetative, reproduction, and, is, widely, practiced, in, horticulture, to, mass, produce, plants, of, a, desirable, genotype, this, process, known, as, mericloning, has, been, shown, to, reduce, or, eliminate, viruses, present, in, the, parent, plant, in, multiple, species, of, plants, propagating, through, cuttings, is, another, form, of, vegetative, propagation, that, initiates, root, or, shoot, production, from, secondary, meristematic, cambial, cells, this, explains, why, basal, wounding, of, shoot, borne, cuttings, often, aids, root, formation, meristems, may, also, be, induced, in, the, roots, of, legumes, such, as, soybean, lotus, japonicus, pea, and, medicago, truncatula, after, infection, with, soil, bacteria, commonly, called, rhizobia, cells, of, the, inner, or, outer, cortex, in, the, so, called, window, of, nodulation, just, behind, the, developing, root, tip, are, induced, to, divide, the, critical, signal, substance, is, the, lipo, oligosaccharide, nod, factor, decorated, with, side, groups, to, allow, specificity, of, interaction, the, nod, factor, receptor, proteins, nfr1, and, nfr5, were, cloned, from, several, legumes, including, lotus, japonicus, medicago, truncatula, and, soybean, glycine, max, regulation, of, nodule, meristems, utilizes, long, distance, regulation, known, as, the, autoregulation, of, nodulation, aon, this, process, involves, a, leaf, vascular, tissue, located, lrr, receptor, kinases, ljhar1, gmnark, and, mtsunn, cle, peptide, signalling, and, kapp, interaction, similar, to, that, seen, in, the, clv1, 2, 3, system, ljklavier, also, exhibits, a, nodule, regulation, phenotype, though, it, is, not, yet, known, how, this, relates, to, the, other, aon, receptor, kinases, lateral, meristems, the, form, of, secondary, plant, growth, add, growth, to, the, plants, in, their, diameter, this, is, primarily, observed, in, perennial, dicots, that, survive, from, year, to, year, there, are, two, types, of, lateral, meristems, vascular, cambium, and, cork, cambium, in, vascular, cambium, the, primary, phloem, and, xylem, are, produced, by, the, apical, meristem, after, this, initial, development, secondary, phloem, and, xylem, are, produced, by, the, lateral, meristem, the, two, are, connected, through, a, thin, layer, of, parenchymal, cells, which, are, differentiated, into, the, fascicular, cambium, the, fascicular, cambium, divides, to, create, the, new, secondary, phloem, and, xylem, following, this, the, cortical, parenchyma, between, vascular, cylinders, differentiates, interfascicular, cambium, this, process, repeats, for, indeterminate, growth, cork, cambium, creates, a, protective, covering, around, the, outside, of, a, plant, this, occurs, after, the, secondary, xylem, and, phloem, has, expanded, already, cortical, parenchymal, cells, differentiate, into, cork, cambium, near, the, epidermis, which, lays, down, new, cells, called, phelloderm, and, cork, cells, these, cork, cells, are, impermeable, to, water, and, gases, because, of, a, substance, called, suberin, that, coats, them
