breadfruit, artocarpus, altilis, is, a, species, of, flowering, tree, in, the, mulberry, and, jackfruit, family, moraceae, believed, to, be, a, domesticated, descendant, of, artocarpus, camansi, originating, in, new, guinea, the, maluku, islands, and, the, philippines, it, was, initially, spread, to, oceania, via, the, austronesian, expansion, it, was, further, spread, to, other, tropical, regions, of, the, world, during, the, colonial, era, british, and, french, navigators, introduced, a, few, polynesian, seedless, varieties, to, caribbean, islands, during, the, late, 18th, century, today, it, is, grown, in, some, 90, countries, throughout, south, and, southeast, asia, the, pacific, ocean, the, caribbean, central, america, and, africa, its, name, is, derived, from, the, texture, of, the, moderately, ripe, fruit, when, cooked, similar, to, freshly, baked, bread, and, having, a, potato, like, flavor, the, trees, have, been, widely, planted, in, tropical, regions, including, lowland, central, america, northern, south, america, and, the, caribbean, in, addition, to, the, fruit, serving, as, a, staple, food, in, many, cultures, the, light, sturdy, timber, of, breadfruit, has, been, used, for, outriggers, ships, and, houses, in, the, tropics, breadfruit, is, closely, related, to, artocarpus, camansi, breadnut, or, seeded, breadfruit, of, new, guinea, the, maluku, islands, and, the, philippines, artocarpus, blancoi, tipolo, or, antipolo, of, the, philippines, and, artocarpus, mariannensis, dugdug, of, micronesia, all, of, which, are, sometimes, also, referred, to, as, breadfruit, it, is, also, closely, related, to, the, jackfruit, breadfruit, trees, grow, to, a, height, of, 26, metres, 85, feet, the, large, and, thick, leaves, are, deeply, cut, into, pinnate, lobes, all, parts, of, the, tree, yield, latex, which, is, useful, for, boat, caulking, the, trees, are, monoecious, with, male, and, female, flowers, growing, on, the, same, tree, the, male, flowers, emerge, first, followed, shortly, afterward, by, the, female, flowers, the, latter, grow, into, capitula, which, are, capable, of, pollination, just, three, days, later, pollination, occurs, mainly, by, fruit, bats, but, cultivated, varieties, produce, fruit, without, pollination, the, compound, false, fruit, develops, from, the, swollen, perianth, and, originates, from, 1, 500, to, 2, 000, flowers, visible, on, the, skin, of, the, fruit, as, hexagon, like, disks, breadfruit, is, one, of, the, highest, yielding, food, plants, with, a, single, tree, producing, up, to, 200, or, more, grapefruit, sized, fruits, per, season, requiring, limited, care, in, the, south, pacific, the, trees, yield, 50, to, 150, fruits, per, year, usually, round, oval, or, oblong, weighing, 0, 25, to, 6, kilograms, 0, 55, to, 13, lb, productivity, varies, between, wet, and, dry, areas, studies, in, barbados, indicate, a, reasonable, potential, of, 15, to, 30, tonnes, per, hectare, 6, 7, to, 13, 4, short, ton, acre, the, ovoid, fruit, has, a, rough, surface, and, each, fruit, is, divided, into, many, achenes, each, achene, surrounded, by, a, fleshy, perianth, and, growing, on, a, fleshy, receptacle, most, selectively, bred, cultivars, have, seedless, fruit, whereas, seeded, varieties, are, grown, mainly, for, their, edible, seeds, breadfruit, is, usually, propagated, using, root, cuttings, breadfruit, is, closely, related, to, the, breadnut, it, is, similar, in, appearance, to, its, relative, of, the, same, genus, the, jackfruit, artocarpus, heterophyllus, the, closely, related, artocarpus, camansi, can, be, distinguished, from, a, altilis, by, having, spinier, fruits, with, numerous, seeds, artocarpus, mariannensis, can, be, distinguished, by, having, dark, green, elongated, fruits, with, darker, yellow, flesh, as, well, as, entire, or, shallowly, lobed, leaves, breadfruit, is, propagated, mainly, by, seeds, though, seedless, breadfruit, can, be, propagated, by, transplanting, suckers, that, grow, off, the, surface, roots, of, the, tree, the, roots, can, be, purposefully, injured, to, induce, the, growth, of, suckers, which, are, then, separated, from, the, root, and, planted, in, a, pot, or, directly, transplanted, into, the, ground, pruning, also, induces, sucker, growth, sucker, cuttings, are, placed, in, plastic, bags, containing, a, mixture, of, soil, peat, and, sand, and, kept, in, the, shade, while, moistened, with, liquid, fertilizer, when, roots, are, developed, the, transplant, is, put, in, full, sun, until, time, for, planting, in, the, orchard, for, large, scale, propagation, root, cuttings, are, preferred, using, segments, about, 10, centimetres, 2, in, thick, and, 20, centimetres, 9, in, long, rooting, may, take, up, to, 5, months, to, develop, with, the, young, trees, ready, for, planting, when, they, are, 60, centimetres, 2, ft, high, the, term, breadfruit, was, first, used, in, the, 17th, century, to, describe, the, bread, like, texture, of, the, fruit, when, baked, breadfruit, has, hundreds, of, varieties, and, numerous, common, names, varying, by, its, geographic, distribution, according, to, dna, fingerprinting, studies, the, wild, seeded, ancestor, of, breadfruit, is, the, breadnut, artocarpus, camansi, which, is, native, to, new, guinea, the, maluku, islands, and, the, philippines, it, was, one, of, the, canoe, plants, spread, by, austronesian, voyagers, around, 3, 000, years, ago, into, micronesia, melanesia, and, polynesia, where, it, was, not, native, a, camansi, was, domesticated, and, selectively, bred, in, polynesia, giving, rise, to, the, mostly, seedless, artocarpus, altilis, micronesian, breadfruit, also, show, evidence, of, hybridization, with, the, native, artocarpus, mariannensis, while, most, polynesian, and, melanesian, cultivars, do, not, this, indicates, that, micronesia, was, initially, colonized, separately, from, polynesia, and, melanesia, through, two, different, migration, events, which, later, came, into, contact, with, each, other, in, eastern, micronesia, breadfruit, is, an, equatorial, lowland, species, it, has, been, spread, from, its, pacific, source, to, many, tropical, regions, in, 1769, joseph, banks, was, stationed, in, tahiti, as, part, of, the, endeavour, expedition, commanded, by, captain, james, cook, the, late, 18th,

breadfruit, according, to, an, etiological, hawaiian, myth, the, breadfruit, originated, from, the, sacrifice, of, the, war, god, k, after, deciding, to, live, secretly, among, mortals, as, a, farmer, k, married, and, had, children, he, and, his, family, lived, happily, until, a, famine, seized, their, island, when, he, could, no, longer, bear, to, watch, his, children, suffer, k, told, his, wife, that, he, could, deliver, them, from, starvation, but, to, do, so, he, would, have, to, leave, them, reluctantly, she, agreed, and, at, her, word, k, descended, into, the, ground, right, where, he, had, stood, until, only, the, top, of, his, head, was, visible, his, family, waited, around, the, spot, he, had, last, been, day, and, night, watering, it, with, their, tears, until, suddenly, a, small, green, shoot, appeared, where, k, had, stood, quickly, the, shoot, grew, into, a, tall, and, leafy, tree, that, was, laden, with, heavy, breadfruits, that, k, s, family, and, neighbors, gratefully, ate, joyfully, saved, from, starvation, though, they, are, widely, distributed, throughout, the, pacific, many, breadfruit, hybrids, and, cultivars, are, seedless, or, otherwise, biologically, incapable, of, naturally, dispersing, long, distances, therefore, it, is, clear, that, humans, aided, distribution, of, the, plant, in, the, pacific, specifically, prehistoric, groups, who, colonized, the, pacific, islands, to, investigate, the, patterns, of, human, migration, throughout, the, pacific, scientists, have, used, molecular, dating, of, breadfruit, hybrids, and, cultivars, in, concert, with, anthropological, data, results, support, the, west, to, east, migration, hypothesis, in, which, the, lapita, people, are, thought, to, have, traveled, from, melanesia, to, numerous, polynesian, islands, the, world, s, largest, collection, of, breadfruit, varieties, was, established, by, botanist, diane, ragone, from, over, 20, years, travel, to, 50, pacific, islands, on, a, 4, hectare, 10, acre, plot, outside, of, hana, on, the, isolated, east, coast, of, maui, hawaii
