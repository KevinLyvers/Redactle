a, stem, is, one, of, two, main, structural, axes, of, a, vascular, plant, the, other, being, the, root, it, supports, leaves, flowers, and, fruits, transports, water, and, dissolved, substances, between, the, roots, and, the, shoots, in, the, xylem, and, phloem, engages, in, photosynthesis, stores, nutrients, and, produces, new, living, tissue, the, stem, can, also, be, called, the, culm, halm, haulm, or, thyrsus, the, stem, is, normally, divided, into, nodes, and, internodes, the, term, shoots, is, often, confused, with, stems, shoots, generally, refers, to, new, fresh, plant, growth, including, both, stems, and, other, structures, like, leaves, or, flowers, in, most, plants, stems, are, located, above, the, soil, surface, but, some, plants, have, underground, stems, stems, have, several, main, functions, stems, have, two, pipe, like, tissues, called, xylem, and, phloem, the, xylem, tissue, arises, from, the, cell, facing, inside, and, transports, water, by, the, action, of, transpiration, pull, capillary, action, and, root, pressure, the, phloem, tissue, arises, from, the, cell, facing, outside, and, consists, of, sieve, tubes, and, their, companion, cells, the, function, of, phloem, tissue, is, to, distribute, food, from, photosynthetic, tissue, to, other, tissues, the, two, tissues, are, separated, by, cambium, a, tissue, that, divides, to, form, xylem, or, phloem, cells, stems, are, often, specialized, for, storage, asexual, reproduction, protection, or, photosynthesis, including, the, following, stem, usually, consist, of, three, tissues, dermal, tissue, ground, tissue, and, vascular, tissue, dermal, tissue, covers, the, outer, surface, of, the, stem, and, usually, functions, to, protect, the, stem, tissue, and, control, gas, exchange, the, predominant, cells, of, dermal, tissue, are, epidermal, cells, the, dermal, tissue, of, aquatic, plants, stems, may, lack, the, waterproofing, found, in, aerial, stems, ground, tissue, usually, consists, mainly, of, parenchyma, cells, and, fills, in, around, the, vascular, tissue, it, sometimes, functions, in, photosynthesis, most, or, all, ground, tissue, may, be, lost, in, woody, stems, vascular, tissue, provides, long, distance, transport, and, structural, support, the, arrangement, of, the, vascular, tissues, varies, widely, among, plant, species, dicot, stems, with, primary, growth, have, pith, in, the, center, with, vascular, bundles, forming, a, distinct, ring, visible, when, the, stem, is, viewed, in, cross, section, the, outside, of, the, stem, is, covered, with, an, epidermis, which, is, covered, by, a, waterproof, cuticle, the, epidermis, also, may, contain, stomata, for, gas, exchange, and, multicellular, stem, hairs, called, trichomes, a, cortex, consisting, of, hypodermis, collenchyma, cells, and, endodermis, starch, containing, cells, is, present, above, the, pericycle, and, vascular, bundles, woody, dicots, and, many, nonwoody, dicots, have, secondary, growth, originating, from, their, lateral, or, secondary, meristems, the, vascular, cambium, and, the, cork, cambium, or, phellogen, the, vascular, cambium, forms, between, the, xylem, and, phloem, in, the, vascular, bundles, and, connects, to, form, a, continuous, cylinder, the, vascular, cambium, cells, divide, to, produce, secondary, xylem, to, the, inside, and, secondary, phloem, to, the, outside, as, the, stem, increases, in, diameter, due, to, production, of, secondary, xylem, and, secondary, phloem, the, cortex, and, epidermis, are, eventually, destroyed, before, the, cortex, is, destroyed, a, cork, cambium, develops, there, the, cork, cambium, divides, to, produce, waterproof, cork, cells, externally, and, sometimes, phelloderm, cells, internally, those, three, tissues, form, the, periderm, which, replaces, the, epidermis, in, function, areas, of, loosely, packed, cells, in, the, periderm, that, function, in, gas, exchange, are, called, lenticels, secondary, xylem, is, commercially, important, as, wood, the, seasonal, variation, in, growth, from, the, vascular, cambium, is, what, creates, yearly, tree, rings, in, temperate, climates, tree, rings, are, the, basis, of, dendrochronology, which, dates, wooden, objects, and, associated, artifacts, dendroclimatology, is, the, use, of, tree, rings, as, a, record, of, past, climates, the, aerial, stem, of, an, adult, tree, is, called, a, trunk, the, dead, usually, darker, inner, wood, of, a, large, diameter, trunk, is, termed, the, heartwood, and, is, the, result, of, tylosis, the, outer, living, wood, is, termed, the, sapwood, vascular, bundles, are, present, throughout, the, monocot, stem, although, concentrated, towards, the, outside, this, differs, from, the, dicot, stem, that, has, a, ring, of, vascular, bundles, and, often, none, in, the, center, the, shoot, apex, in, monocot, stems, is, more, elongated, leaf, sheathes, grow, up, around, it, protecting, it, this, is, true, to, some, extent, of, almost, all, monocots, monocots, rarely, produce, secondary, growth, and, are, therefore, seldom, woody, with, palms, and, bamboo, being, notable, exceptions, however, many, monocot, stems, increase, in, diameter, via, anomalous, secondary, growth, all, gymnosperms, are, woody, plants, their, stems, are, similar, in, structure, to, woody, dicots, except, that, most, gymnosperms, produce, only, tracheids, in, their, xylem, not, the, vessels, found, in, dicots, gymnosperm, wood, also, often, contains, resin, ducts, woody, dicots, are, called, hardwoods, e, g, oak, maple, and, walnut, in, contrast, softwoods, are, gymnosperms, such, as, pine, spruce, and, fir, most, ferns, have, rhizomes, with, no, vertical, stem, the, exception, is, tree, ferns, which, have, vertical, stems, that, can, grow, up, to, about, 20, metres, the, stem, anatomy, of, ferns, is, more, complicated, than, that, of, dicots, because, fern, stems, often, have, one, or, more, leaf, gaps, in, cross, section, a, leaf, gap, is, where, the, vascular, tissue, branches, off, to, a, frond, in, cross, section, the, vascular, tissue, does, not, form, a, complete, cylinder, where, a, leaf, gap, occurs, fern, stems, may, have, solenosteles, or, dictyosteles, or, variations, of, them, many, fern, stems, have, phloem, tissue, on, both, sides, of, the, xylem, in, cross, section, foreign, chemicals, such, as, air, pollutants, herbicides, and, pesticides, can, damage, stem, structures, there, are, thousands, of, species, whose, stems, have, economic, uses, stems, provide, a, few, major, staple, crops, such, as, potato, and, taro, sugarcane, stems, are, a, major, source, of, sugar, maple, sugar, is, obtained, from, trunks, of, maple, trees, vegetables, from, stems, are, asparagus, bamboo, shoots, cactus, pads, or, nopalitos, kohlrabi, and, water, chestnut, the, spice, cinnamon, is, bark, from, a, tree, trunk, gum, arabic, is, an, important, food, additive, obtained, from, the, trunks, of, acacia, senegal, trees, chicle, the, main, ingredient, in, chewing, gum, is, obtained, from, trunks, of, the, chicle, tree, medicines, obtained, from, stems, include, quinine, from, the, bark, of, cinchona, trees, camphor, distilled, from, wood, of, a, tree, in, the, same, genus, that, provides, cinnamon, and, the, muscle, relaxant, curare, from, the, bark, of, tropical, vines, wood, is, used, in, thousands, of, ways, it, can, be, used, to, create, buildings, furniture, boats, airplanes, wagons, car, parts, musical, instruments, sports, equipment, railroad, ties, utility, poles, fence, posts, pilings, toothpicks, matches, plywood, coffins, shingles, barrel, staves, toys, tool, handles, picture, frames, veneer, charcoal, and, firewood, wood, pulp, is, widely, used, to, make, paper, paperboard, cellulose, sponges, cellophane, and, some, important, plastics, and, textiles, such, as, cellulose, acetate, and, rayon, bamboo, stems, also, have, hundreds, of, uses, including, in, paper, buildings, furniture, boats, musical, instruments, fishing, poles, water, pipes, plant, stakes, and, scaffolding, trunks, of, palms, and, tree, ferns, are, often, used, for, building, stems, of, reed, are, an, important, building, material, for, use, in, thatching, in, some, areas, tannins, used, for, tanning, leather, are, obtained, from, the, wood, of, certain, trees, such, as, quebracho, cork, is, obtained, from, the, bark, of, the, cork, oak, rubber, is, obtained, from, the, trunks, of, hevea, brasiliensis, rattan, used, for, furniture, and, baskets, is, made, from, the, stems, of, tropical, vining, palms, bast, fibers, for, textiles, and, rope, are, obtained, from, stems, of, plants, like, flax, hemp, jute, and, ramie, the, earliest, known, paper, was, obtained, from, the, stems, of, papyrus, by, the, ancient, egyptians, amber, is, fossilized, sap, from, tree, trunks, it, is, used, for, jewelry, and, may, contain, preserved, animals, resins, from, conifer, wood, are, used, to, produce, turpentine, and, rosin, tree, bark, is, often, used, as, a, mulch, and, in, growing, media, for, container, plants, it, also, can, become, the, natural, habitat, of, lichens, some, ornamental, plants, are, grown, mainly, for, their, attractive, stems, e, g
