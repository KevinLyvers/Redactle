an, eating, disorder, is, a, mental, disorder, defined, by, abnormal, eating, behaviors, that, adversely, affect, a, person, s, physical, or, mental, health, these, behaviors, include, eating, either, too, much, or, too, little, types, of, eating, disorders, include, binge, eating, disorder, where, the, patient, keeps, eating, large, amounts, in, a, short, period, of, time, typically, while, not, being, hungry, anorexia, nervosa, where, the, person, has, an, intense, fear, of, gaining, weight, and, restricts, food, or, overexercises, to, manage, this, fear, bulimia, nervosa, where, individuals, eat, a, large, quantity, binging, then, try, to, rid, themselves, of, the, food, purging, pica, where, the, patient, eats, non, food, items, rumination, syndrome, where, the, patient, regurgitates, undigested, or, minimally, digested, food, avoidant, restrictive, food, intake, disorder, arfid, where, people, have, a, reduced, or, selective, food, intake, due, to, some, psychological, reasons, and, a, group, of, other, specified, feeding, or, eating, disorders, anxiety, disorders, depression, and, substance, abuse, are, common, among, people, with, eating, disorders, these, disorders, do, not, include, obesity, people, often, experience, comorbidity, between, an, eating, disorder, and, ocd, it, is, estimated, 20, 60, of, patients, with, an, ed, have, a, history, of, ocd, the, causes, of, eating, disorders, are, not, clear, although, both, biological, and, environmental, factors, appear, to, play, a, role, cultural, idealization, of, thinness, is, believed, to, contribute, to, some, eating, disorders, individuals, who, have, experienced, sexual, abuse, are, also, more, likely, to, develop, eating, disorders, some, disorders, such, as, pica, and, rumination, disorder, occur, more, often, in, people, with, intellectual, disabilities, treatment, can, be, effective, for, many, eating, disorders, treatment, varies, by, disorder, and, may, involve, counseling, dietary, advice, reducing, excessive, exercise, and, the, reduction, of, efforts, to, eliminate, food, medications, may, be, used, to, help, with, some, of, the, associated, symptoms, hospitalization, may, be, needed, in, more, serious, cases, about, 70, of, people, with, anorexia, and, 50, of, people, with, bulimia, recover, within, five, years, only, 10, of, people, with, eating, disorders, receive, treatment, and, of, those, approximately, 80, do, not, receive, the, proper, care, many, are, sent, home, weeks, earlier, than, the, recommended, stay, and, are, not, provided, with, the, necessary, treatment, recovery, from, binge, eating, disorder, is, less, clear, and, estimated, at, 20, to, 60, both, anorexia, and, bulimia, increase, the, risk, of, death, when, people, experience, comorbidity, with, an, eating, disorder, and, ocd, certain, aspects, of, treatment, can, be, negatively, impacted, ocd, can, make, it, harder, to, recover, from, obsession, over, weight, and, shape, body, dissatisfaction, and, body, checking, this, is, in, part, because, ed, cognitions, serve, a, similar, purpose, to, ocd, obsessions, and, compulsions, e, g, safety, behaviors, as, temporary, relief, from, anxiety, research, shows, ocd, does, not, have, an, impact, on, the, bmi, of, patients, during, treatment, estimates, of, the, prevalence, of, eating, disorders, vary, widely, reflecting, differences, in, gender, age, and, culture, as, well, as, methods, used, for, diagnosis, and, measurement, in, the, developed, world, anorexia, affects, about, 0, 4, and, bulimia, affects, about, 1, 3, of, young, women, in, a, given, year, binge, eating, disorder, affects, about, 1, 6, of, women, and, 0, 8, of, men, in, a, given, year, according, to, one, analysis, the, percent, of, women, who, will, have, anorexia, at, some, point, in, their, lives, may, be, up, to, 4, or, up, to, 2, for, bulimia, and, binge, eating, disorders, rates, of, eating, disorders, appear, to, be, lower, in, less, developed, countries, anorexia, and, bulimia, occur, nearly, ten, times, more, often, in, females, than, males, the, typical, onset, of, eating, disorders, is, in, late, childhood, to, early, adulthood, rates, of, other, eating, disorders, are, not, clear, these, eating, disorders, are, specified, as, mental, disorders, in, standard, medical, manuals, including, the, icd, 10, and, the, dsm, 5, pubertal, and, post, pubertal, females, with, anorexia, often, experience, amenorrhea, that, is, the, loss, of, menstrual, periods, due, to, the, extreme, weight, loss, these, individuals, face, although, amenorrhea, was, a, required, criterion, for, a, diagnosis, of, anorexia, in, the, dsm, iv, it, was, dropped, in, the, dsm, 5, due, to, its, exclusive, nature, as, male, post, menopause, women, or, individuals, who, do, not, menstruate, for, other, reasons, would, fail, to, meet, this, criterion, females, with, bulimia, may, also, experience, amenorrhea, although, the, cause, is, not, clear, symptoms, and, complications, vary, according, to, the, nature, and, severity, of, the, eating, disorder, associated, physical, symptoms, of, eating, disorders, include, weakness, fatigue, sensitivity, to, cold, reduced, beard, growth, in, men, reduction, in, waking, erections, reduced, libido, weight, loss, and, growth, failure, frequent, vomiting, which, may, cause, acid, reflux, or, entry, of, acidic, gastric, material, into, the, laryngoesophageal, tract, can, lead, to, unexplained, hoarseness, as, such, individuals, who, induce, vomiting, as, part, of, their, eating, disorder, such, as, those, with, anorexia, nervosa, binge, eating, purging, type, or, those, with, purging, type, bulimia, nervosa, are, at, risk, for, acid, reflux, polycystic, ovary, syndrome, pcos, is, the, most, common, endocrine, disorder, to, affect, women, though, often, associated, with, obesity, it, can, occur, in, normal, weight, individuals, pcos, has, been, associated, with, binge, eating, and, bulimic, behavior, other, possible, manifestations, are, dry, lips, burning, tongue, parotid, gland, swelling, and, temporomandibular, disorders, the, psychopathology, of, eating, disorders, centers, around, body, image, disturbance, such, as, concerns, with, weight, and, shape, self, worth, being, too, dependent, on, weight, and, shape, fear, of, gaining, weight, even, when, underweight, denial, of, how, severe, the, symptoms, are, and, a, distortion, in, the, way, the, body, is, experienced, the, main, psychopathological, features, of, anorexia, were, outlined, in, 1982, as, problems, in, body, perception, emotion, processing, and, interpersonal, relationships, women, with, eating, disorders, have, greater, body, dissatisfaction, this, impairment, of, body, perception, involves, vision, proprioception, interoception, and, tactile, perception, there, is, an, alteration, in, integration, of, signals, in, which, body, parts, are, experienced, as, dissociated, from, the, body, as, a, whole, bruch, once, theorized, that, difficult, early, relationships, were, related, to, the, cause, of, anorexia, and, how, primary, caregivers, can, contribute, to, the, onset, of, the, illness, a, prominent, feature, of, bulimia, is, dissatisfaction, with, body, shape, however, dissatisfaction, with, body, shape, is, not, of, diagnostic, significance, as, it, is, sometimes, present, in, individuals, with, no, eating, disorder, this, highly, labile, feature, can, fluctuate, depending, on, changes, in, shape, and, weight, the, degree, of, control, over, eating, and, mood, in, contrast, a, necessary, diagnostic, feature, for, anorexia, nervosa, and, bulimia, nervosa, is, having, overvalued, ideas, about, shape, and, weight, are, relatively, stable, and, partially, related, to, the, patients, low, self, esteem, pro, ana, refers, to, the, promotion, of, behaviors, related, to, the, eating, disorder, anorexia, nervosa, several, websites, promote, eating, disorders, and, can, provide, a, means, for, individuals, to, communicate, in, order, to, maintain, eating, disorders, members, of, these, websites, typically, feel, that, their, eating, disorder, is, the, only, aspect, of, a, chaotic, life, that, they, can, control, these, websites, are, often, interactive, and, have, discussion, boards, where, individuals, can, share, strategies, ideas, and, experiences, such, as, diet, and, exercise, plans, that, achieve, extremely, low, weights, a, study, comparing, the, personal, web, blogs, that, were, pro, eating, disorder, with, those, focused, on, recovery, found, that, the, pro, eating, disorder, blogs, contained, language, reflecting, lower, cognitive, processing, used, a, more, closed, minded, writing, style, contained, less, emotional, expression, and, fewer, social, references, and, focused, more, on, eating, related, contents, than, did, the, recovery, blogs, there, is, no, single, cause, of, eating, disorders, many, people, with, eating, disorders, also, have, body, image, disturbance, and, a, comorbid, body, dysmorphic, disorder, bdd, leading, them, to, an, altered, perception, of, their, body, studies, have, found, that, a, high, proportion, of, individuals, diagnosed, with, body, dysmorphic, disorder, also, had, some, type, of, eating, disorder, with, 15, of, individuals, having, either, anorexia, nervosa, or, bulimia, nervosa, this, link, between, body, dysmorphic, disorder, and, anorexia, stems, from, the, fact, that, both, bdd, and, anorexia, nervosa, are, characterized, by, a, preoccupation, with, physical, appearance, and, a, distortion, of, body, image, there, are, also, many, other, possibilities, such, as, environmental, social, and, interpersonal, issues, that, could, promote, and, sustain, these, illnesses, also, the, media, are, oftentimes, blamed, for, the, rise, in, the, incidence, of, eating, disorders, due, to, the, fact, that, media, images, of, idealized, slim, physical, shape, of, people, such, as, models, and, celebrities, motivate, or, even, force, people, to, attempt, to, achieve, slimness, themselves, the, media, are, accused, of, distorting, reality, in, the, sense, that, people, portrayed, in, the, media, are, either, naturally, thin, and, thus, unrepresentative, of, normality, or, unnaturally, thin, by, forcing, their, bodies, to, look, like, the, ideal, image, by, putting, excessive, pressure, on, themselves, to, look, a, certain, way, while, past, findings, have, described, eating, disorders, as, primarily, psychological, environmental, and, sociocultural, further, studies, have, uncovered, evidence, that, there, is, a, genetic, component, numerous, studies, show, a, genetic, predisposition, toward, eating, disorders, twin, studies, have, found, a, slight, instances, of, genetic, variance, when, considering, the, different, criterion, of, both, anorexia, nervosa, and, bulimia, nervosa, as, endophenotypes, contributing, to, the, disorders, as, a, whole, a, genetic, link, has, been, found, on, chromosome, 1, in, multiple, family, members, of, an, individual, with, anorexia, nervosa, an, individual, who, is, a, first, degree, relative, of, someone, who, has, had, or, currently, has, an, eating, disorder, is, seven, to, twelve, times, more, likely, to, have, an, eating, disorder, themselves, twin, studies, also, show, that, at, least, a, portion, of, the, vulnerability, to, develop, eating, disorders, can, be, inherited, and, there, is, evidence, to, show, that, there, is, a, genetic, locus, that, shows, susceptibility, for, developing, anorexia, nervosa, about, 50, of, eating, disorder, cases, are, attributable, to, genetics, other, cases, are, due, to, external, reasons, or, developmental, problems, there, are, also, other, neurobiological, factors, at, play, tied, to, emotional, reactivity, and, impulsivity, that, could, lead, to, binging, and, purging, behaviors, epigenetics, mechanisms, are, means, by, which, environmental, effects, alter, gene, expression, via, methods, such, as, dna, methylation, these, are, independent, of, and, do, not, alter, the, underlying, dna, sequence, they, are, heritable, but, also, may, occur, throughout, the, lifespan, and, are, potentially, reversible, dysregulation, of, dopaminergic, neurotransmission, due, to, epigenetic, mechanisms, has, been, implicated, in, various, eating, disorders, other, candidate, genes, for, epigenetic, studies, in, eating, disorders, include, leptin, pro, opiomelanocortin, pomc, and, brain, derived, neurotrophic, factor, bdnf, there, has, found, to, be, a, genetic, correlation, between, anorexia, nervosa, and, ocd, suggesting, a, strong, etiology, first, and, second, relatives, of, probands, with, ocd, have, a, greater, chance, of, developing, anorexia, nervosa, as, genetic, relatedness, increases, eating, disorders, are, classified, as, axis, i, disorders, in, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, health, disorders, dsm, iv, published, by, the, american, psychiatric, association, there, are, various, other, psychological, issues, that, may, factor, into, eating, disorders, some, fulfill, the, criteria, for, a, separate, axis, i, diagnosis, or, a, personality, disorder, which, is, coded, axis, ii, and, thus, are, considered, comorbid, to, the, diagnosed, eating, disorder, axis, ii, disorders, are, subtyped, into, 3, clusters, a, b, and, c, the, causality, between, personality, disorders, and, eating, disorders, has, yet, to, be, fully, established, some, people, have, a, previous, disorder, which, may, increase, their, vulnerability, to, developing, an, eating, disorder, some, develop, them, afterwards, the, severity, and, type, of, eating, disorder, symptoms, have, been, shown, to, affect, comorbidity, there, has, been, controversy, over, various, editions, of, the, dsm, diagnostic, criteria, including, the, latest, edition, dsm, v, published, in, 2013, attentional, bias, may, have, an, effect, on, eating, disorders, attentional, bias, is, the, preferential, attention, toward, certain, types, of, information, in, the, environment, while, simultaneously, ignoring, others, individuals, with, eating, disorders, can, be, thought, to, have, schemas, knowledge, structures, which, are, dysfunctional, as, they, may, bias, judgement, thought, behaviour, in, a, manner, that, is, self, destructive, or, maladaptive, they, may, have, developed, a, disordered, schema, which, focuses, on, body, size, and, eating, thus, this, information, is, given, the, highest, level, of, importance, and, overvalued, among, other, cognitive, structures, researchers, have, found, that, people, who, have, eating, disorders, tend, to, pay, more, attention, to, stimuli, related, to, food, for, people, struggling, to, recover, from, an, eating, disorder, or, addiction, this, tendency, to, pay, attention, to, certain, signals, while, discounting, others, can, make, recovery, that, much, more, difficult, studies, have, utilized, the, stroop, task, to, assess, the, probable, effect, of, attentional, bias, on, eating, disorders, this, may, involve, separating, food, and, eating, words, from, body, shape, and, weight, words, such, studies, have, found, that, anorexic, subjects, were, slower, to, colour, name, food, related, words, than, control, subjects, other, studies, have, noted, that, individuals, with, eating, disorders, have, significant, attentional, biases, associated, with, eating, and, weight, stimuli, there, are, various, childhood, personality, traits, associated, with, the, development, of, eating, disorders, such, as, perfectionism, and, neuroticism, these, personality, traits, are, found, to, link, eating, disorders, and, ocd, during, adolescence, these, traits, may, become, intensified, due, to, a, variety, of, physiological, and, cultural, influences, such, as, the, hormonal, changes, associated, with, puberty, stress, related, to, the, approaching, demands, of, maturity, and, socio, cultural, influences, and, perceived, expectations, especially, in, areas, that, concern, body, image, eating, disorders, have, been, associated, with, a, fragile, sense, of, self, and, with, disordered, mentalization, many, personality, traits, have, a, genetic, component, and, are, highly, heritable, maladaptive, levels, of, certain, traits, may, be, acquired, as, a, result, of, anoxic, or, traumatic, brain, injury, neurodegenerative, diseases, such, as, parkinson, s, disease, neurotoxicity, such, as, lead, exposure, bacterial, infection, such, as, lyme, disease, or, parasitic, infection, such, as, toxoplasma, gondii, as, well, as, hormonal, influences, while, studies, are, still, continuing, via, the, use, of, various, imaging, techniques, such, as, fmri, these, traits, have, been, shown, to, originate, in, various, regions, of, the, brain, such, as, the, amygdala, and, the, prefrontal, cortex, disorders, in, the, prefrontal, cortex, and, the, executive, functioning, system, have, been, shown, to, affect, eating, behavior, people, with, gastrointestinal, disorders, may, be, more, risk, of, developing, disordered, eating, practices, than, the, general, population, principally, restrictive, eating, disturbances, an, association, of, anorexia, nervosa, with, celiac, disease, has, been, found, the, role, that, gastrointestinal, symptoms, play, in, the, development, of, eating, disorders, seems, rather, complex, some, authors, report, that, unresolved, symptoms, prior, to, gastrointestinal, disease, diagnosis, may, create, a, food, aversion, in, these, persons, causing, alterations, to, their, eating, patterns, other, authors, report, that, greater, symptoms, throughout, their, diagnosis, led, to, greater, risk, it, has, been, documented, that, some, people, with, celiac, disease, irritable, bowel, syndrome, or, inflammatory, bowel, disease, who, are, not, conscious, about, the, importance, of, strictly, following, their, diet, choose, to, consume, their, trigger, foods, to, promote, weight, loss, on, the, other, hand, individuals, with, good, dietary, management, may, develop, anxiety, food, aversion, and, eating, disorders, because, of, concerns, around, cross, contamination, of, their, foods, some, authors, suggest, that, medical, professionals, should, evaluate, the, presence, of, an, unrecognized, celiac, disease, in, all, people, with, eating, disorder, especially, if, they, present, any, gastrointestinal, symptom, such, as, decreased, appetite, abdominal, pain, bloating, distension, vomiting, diarrhea, or, constipation, weight, loss, or, growth, failure, and, also, routinely, ask, celiac, patients, about, weight, or, body, shape, concerns, dieting, or, vomiting, for, weight, control, to, evaluate, the, possible, presence, of, eating, disorders, specially, in, women, child, abuse, which, encompasses, physical, psychological, and, sexual, abuse, as, well, as, neglect, has, been, shown, to, approximately, triple, the, risk, of, an, eating, disorder, sexual, abuse, appears, to, be, about, double, the, risk, of, bulimia, however, the, association, is, less, clear, for, anorexia, the, risk, for, individuals, developing, eating, disorders, increases, if, the, individual, grew, up, in, an, invalidating, environment, where, displays, of, emotions, were, often, punished, abuse, that, has, also, occurred, in, childhood, produces, intolerable, difficult, emotions, that, cannot, be, expressed, in, a, healthy, manner, eating, disorders, come, in, as, an, escape, coping, mechanism, as, a, means, to, control, and, avoid, overwhelming, negative, emotions, and, feelings, those, who, report, physical, or, sexual, maltreatment, as, a, child, are, at, an, increased, risk, of, developing, an, eating, disorder, social, isolation, has, been, shown, to, have, a, deleterious, effect, on, an, individual, s, physical, and, emotional, well, being, those, that, are, socially, isolated, have, a, higher, mortality, rate, in, general, as, compared, to, individuals, that, have, established, social, relationships, this, effect, on, mortality, is, markedly, increased, in, those, with, pre, existing, medical, or, psychiatric, conditions, and, has, been, especially, noted, in, cases, of, coronary, heart, disease, the, magnitude, of, risk, associated, with, social, isolation, is, comparable, with, that, of, cigarette, smoking, and, other, major, biomedical, and, psychosocial, risk, factors, brummett, et, al, social, isolation, can, be, inherently, stressful, depressing, and, anxiety, provoking, in, an, attempt, to, ameliorate, these, distressful, feelings, an, individual, may, engage, in, emotional, eating, in, which, food, serves, as, a, source, of, comfort, the, loneliness, of, social, isolation, and, the, inherent, stressors, thus, associated, have, been, implicated, as, triggering, factors, in, binge, eating, as, well, waller, kennerley, and, ohanian, 2007, argued, that, both, bingeing, vomiting, and, restriction, are, emotion, suppression, strategies, but, they, are, just, utilized, at, different, times, for, example, restriction, is, used, to, pre, empt, any, emotion, activation, while, bingeing, vomiting, is, used, after, an, emotion, has, been, activated, parental, influence, has, been, shown, to, be, an, intrinsic, component, in, the, development, of, eating, behaviors, of, children, this, influence, is, manifested, and, shaped, by, a, variety, of, diverse, factors, such, as, familial, genetic, predisposition, dietary, choices, as, dictated, by, cultural, or, ethnic, preferences, the, parents, own, body, shape, and, eating, patterns, the, degree, of, involvement, and, expectations, of, their, children, s, eating, behavior, as, well, as, the, interpersonal, relationship, of, parent, and, child, it, is, also, influenced, by, the, general, psychosocial, climate, of, the, home, and, whether, a, nurturing, stable, environment, is, present, it, has, been, shown, that, maladaptive, parental, behavior, has, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, eating, disorders, as, to, the, more, subtle, aspects, of, parental, influence, it, has, been, shown, that, eating, patterns, are, established, in, early, childhood, and, that, children, should, be, allowed, to, decide, when, their, appetite, is, satisfied, as, early, as, the, age, of, two, a, direct, link, has, been, shown, between, obesity, and, parental, pressure, to, eat, more, coercive, tactics, in, regard, to, diet, have, not, been, proven, to, be, efficacious, in, controlling, a, child, s, eating, behavior, affection, and, attention, have, been, shown, to, affect, the, degree, of, a, child, s, finickiness, and, their, acceptance, of, a, more, varied, diet, adams, and, crane, 1980, have, shown, that, parents, are, influenced, by, stereotypes, that, influence, their, perception, of, their, child, s, body, the, conveyance, of, these, negative, stereotypes, also, affects, the, child, s, own, body, image, and, satisfaction, hilde, bruch, a, pioneer, in, the, field, of, studying, eating, disorders, asserts, that, anorexia, nervosa, often, occurs, in, girls, who, are, high, achievers, obedient, and, always, trying, to, please, their, parents, their, parents, have, a, tendency, to, be, over, controlling, and, fail, to, encourage, the, expression, of, emotions, inhibiting, daughters, from, accepting, their, own, feelings, and, desires, adolescent, females, in, these, overbearing, families, lack, the, ability, to, be, independent, from, their, families, yet, realize, the, need, to, often, resulting, in, rebellion, controlling, their, food, intake, may, make, them, feel, better, as, it, provides, them, with, a, sense, of, control, in, various, studies, such, as, one, conducted, by, the, mcknight, investigators, peer, pressure, was, shown, to, be, a, significant, contributor, to, body, image, concerns, and, attitudes, toward, eating, among, subjects, in, their, teens, and, early, twenties, eleanor, mackey, and, co, author, annette, m, la, greca, of, the, university, of, miami, studied, 236, teen, girls, from, public, high, schools, in, southeast, florida, teen, girls, concerns, about, their, own, weight, about, how, they, appear, to, others, and, their, perceptions, that, their, peers, want, them, to, be, thin, are, significantly, related, to, weight, control, behavior, says, psychologist, eleanor, mackey, of, the, children, s, national, medical, center, in, washington, and, lead, author, of, the, study, those, are, really, important, according, to, one, study, 40, of, 9, and, 10, year, old, girls, are, already, trying, to, lose, weight, such, dieting, is, reported, to, be, influenced, by, peer, behavior, with, many, of, those, individuals, on, a, diet, reporting, that, their, friends, also, were, dieting, the, number, of, friends, dieting, and, the, number, of, friends, who, pressured, them, to, diet, also, played, a, significant, role, in, their, own, choices, elite, athletes, have, a, significantly, higher, rate, in, eating, disorders, female, athletes, in, sports, such, as, gymnastics, ballet, diving, etc, are, found, to, be, at, the, highest, risk, among, all, athletes, women, are, more, likely, than, men, to, acquire, an, eating, disorder, between, the, ages, of, 13, and, 25, about, 0, 15, of, those, with, bulimia, and, anorexia, are, men, other, psychological, problems, that, could, possibly, create, an, eating, disorder, such, as, anorexia, nervosa, are, depression, and, low, self, esteem, depression, is, a, state, of, mind, where, emotions, are, unstable, causing, a, person, s, eating, habits, to, change, due, to, sadness, and, no, interest, of, doing, anything, according, to, psycom, studies, show, that, a, high, percentage, of, people, with, an, eating, disorder, will, experience, depression, depression, is, a, state, of, mind, where, people, seem, to, refuge, without, being, able, to, get, out, of, it, a, big, factor, of, this, can, affect, people, with, their, eating, and, this, can, mostly, affect, teenagers, teenagers, are, big, candidates, for, anorexia, for, the, reason, that, during, the, teenage, years, many, things, start, changing, and, they, start, to, think, certain, ways, according, to, life, works, an, article, about, eating, disorders, people, of, any, age, can, be, affected, by, pressure, from, their, peers, the, media, and, even, their, families, but, it, is, worse, when, you, re, a, teenager, at, school, teenagers, can, develop, eating, disorder, such, as, anorexia, due, to, peer, pressure, which, can, lead, to, depression, many, teens, start, off, this, journey, by, feeling, pressure, for, wanting, to, look, a, certain, way, of, feeling, pressure, for, being, different, this, brings, them, to, finding, the, result, in, eating, less, and, soon, leading, to, anorexia, which, can, bring, big, harms, to, the, physical, state, there, is, a, cultural, emphasis, on, thinness, which, is, especially, pervasive, in, western, society, a, child, s, perception, of, external, pressure, to, achieve, the, ideal, body, that, is, represented, by, the, media, predicts, the, child, s, body, image, dissatisfaction, body, dysmorphic, disorder, and, an, eating, disorder, the, cultural, pressure, on, men, and, women, to, be, perfect, is, an, important, predisposing, factor, for, the, development, of, eating, disorders, further, when, women, of, all, races, base, their, evaluation, of, their, self, upon, what, is, considered, the, culturally, ideal, body, the, incidence, of, eating, disorders, increases, socioeconomic, status, ses, has, been, viewed, as, a, risk, factor, for, eating, disorders, presuming, that, possessing, more, resources, allows, for, an, individual, to, actively, choose, to, diet, and, reduce, body, weight, some, studies, have, also, shown, a, relationship, between, increasing, body, dissatisfaction, with, increasing, ses, however, once, high, socioeconomic, status, has, been, achieved, this, relationship, weakens, and, in, some, cases, no, longer, exists, the, media, plays, a, major, role, in, the, way, in, which, people, view, themselves, countless, magazine, ads, and, commercials, depict, thin, celebrities, society, has, taught, people, that, being, accepted, by, others, is, necessary, at, all, costs, this, has, led, to, the, belief, that, in, order, to, fit, in, one, must, look, a, certain, way, televised, beauty, competitions, such, as, the, miss, america, competition, contribute, to, the, idea, of, what, it, means, to, be, beautiful, because, competitors, are, evaluated, on, the, basis, of, their, opinion, in, addition, to, socioeconomic, status, being, considered, a, cultural, risk, factor, so, is, the, world, of, sports, athletes, and, eating, disorders, tend, to, go, hand, in, hand, especially, the, sports, where, weight, is, a, competitive, factor, gymnastics, horse, back, riding, wrestling, body, building, and, dancing, are, just, a, few, that, fall, into, this, category, of, weight, dependent, sports, eating, disorders, among, individuals, that, participate, in, competitive, activities, especially, women, often, lead, to, having, physical, and, biological, changes, related, to, their, weight, that, often, mimic, prepubescent, stages, oftentimes, as, women, s, bodies, change, they, lose, their, competitive, edge, which, leads, them, to, taking, extreme, measures, to, maintain, their, younger, body, shape, men, often, struggle, with, binge, eating, followed, by, excessive, exercise, while, focusing, on, building, muscle, rather, than, losing, fat, but, this, goal, of, gaining, muscle, is, just, as, much, an, eating, disorder, as, obsessing, over, thinness, the, following, statistics, taken, from, susan, nolen, hoeksema, s, book, ab, normal, psychology, show, the, estimated, percentage, of, athletes, that, struggle, with, eating, disorders, based, on, the, category, of, sport, although, most, of, these, athletes, develop, eating, disorders, to, keep, their, competitive, edge, others, use, exercise, as, a, way, to, maintain, their, weight, and, figure, this, is, just, as, serious, as, regulating, food, intake, for, competition, even, though, there, is, mixed, evidence, showing, at, what, point, athletes, are, challenged, with, eating, disorders, studies, show, that, regardless, of, competition, level, all, athletes, are, at, higher, risk, for, developing, eating, disorders, that, non, athletes, especially, those, that, participate, in, sports, where, thinness, is, a, factor, pressure, from, society, is, also, seen, within, the, homosexual, community, gay, men, are, at, greater, risk, of, eating, disorder, symptoms, than, heterosexual, men, within, the, gay, culture, muscularity, gives, the, advantages, of, both, social, and, sexual, desirability, and, also, power, these, pressures, and, ideas, that, another, homosexual, male, may, desire, a, mate, who, is, thinner, or, muscular, can, possibly, lead, to, eating, disorders, the, higher, eating, disorder, symptom, score, reported, the, more, concern, about, how, others, perceive, them, and, the, more, frequent, and, excessive, exercise, sessions, occur, high, levels, of, body, dissatisfaction, are, also, linked, to, external, motivation, to, working, out, and, old, age, however, having, a, thin, and, muscular, body, occurs, within, younger, homosexual, males, than, older, most, of, the, cross, cultural, studies, use, definitions, from, the, dsm, iv, tr, which, has, been, criticized, as, reflecting, a, western, cultural, bias, thus, assessments, and, questionnaires, may, not, be, constructed, to, detect, some, of, the, cultural, differences, associated, with, different, disorders, also, when, looking, at, individuals, in, areas, potentially, influenced, by, western, culture, few, studies, have, attempted, to, measure, how, much, an, individual, has, adopted, the, mainstream, culture, or, retained, the, traditional, cultural, values, of, the, area, lastly, the, majority, of, the, cross, cultural, studies, on, eating, disorders, and, body, image, disturbances, occurred, in, western, nations, and, not, in, the, countries, or, regions, being, examined, while, there, are, many, influences, to, how, an, individual, processes, their, body, image, the, media, does, play, a, major, role, along, with, the, media, parental, influence, peer, influence, and, self, efficacy, beliefs, also, play, a, large, role, in, an, individual, s, view, of, themselves, the, way, the, media, presents, images, can, have, a, lasting, effect, on, an, individual, s, perception, of, their, body, image, eating, disorders, are, a, worldwide, issue, and, while, women, are, more, likely, to, be, affected, by, an, eating, disorder, it, still, affects, both, genders, schwitzer, 2012, the, media, influences, eating, disorders, whether, shown, in, a, positive, or, negative, light, it, then, has, a, responsibility, to, use, caution, when, promoting, images, that, projects, an, ideal, that, many, turn, to, eating, disorders, to, attain, to, try, to, address, unhealthy, body, image, in, the, fashion, world, in, 2015, france, passed, a, law, requiring, models, to, be, declared, healthy, by, a, doctor, to, participate, in, fashion, shows, it, also, requires, re, touched, images, to, be, marked, as, such, in, magazines, there, is, a, relationship, between, thin, ideal, social, media, content, and, body, dissatisfaction, and, eating, disorders, among, young, adult, women, especially, in, the, western, hemisphere, new, research, points, to, an, internalization, of, distorted, images, online, as, well, as, negative, comparisons, among, young, adult, women, most, studies, have, been, based, in, the, u, s, the, u, k, and, australia, these, are, places, where, the, thin, ideal, is, strong, among, women, as, well, as, the, strive, for, the, perfect, body, in, addition, to, mere, media, exposure, there, is, an, online, pro, eating, disorder, community, through, personal, blogs, and, twitter, this, community, promotes, eating, disorders, as, a, lifestyle, and, continuously, posts, pictures, of, emaciated, bodies, and, tips, on, how, to, stay, thin, the, hashtag, proana, pro, anorexia, is, a, product, of, this, community, as, well, as, images, promoting, weight, loss, tagged, with, the, term, thinspiration, according, to, social, comparison, theory, young, women, have, a, tendency, to, compare, their, appearance, to, others, which, can, result, in, a, negative, view, of, their, own, bodies, and, altering, of, eating, behaviors, that, in, turn, can, develop, disordered, eating, behaviors, when, body, parts, are, isolated, and, displayed, in, the, media, as, objects, to, be, looked, at, it, is, called, objectification, and, women, are, affected, most, by, this, phenomenon, objectification, increases, self, objectification, where, women, judge, their, own, body, parts, as, a, mean, of, praise, and, pleasure, for, others, there, is, a, significant, link, between, self, objectification, body, dissatisfaction, and, disordered, eating, as, the, beauty, ideal, is, altered, through, social, media, although, eating, disorders, are, typically, under, diagnosed, in, people, of, color, they, still, experience, eating, disorders, in, great, numbers, it, is, thought, that, the, stress, that, those, of, color, face, in, the, united, states, from, being, multiply, marginalized, may, contribute, to, their, rates, of, eating, disorders, eating, disorders, for, these, women, may, be, a, response, to, environmental, stressors, such, as, racism, abuse, and, poverty, in, the, majority, of, many, african, communities, thinness, is, generally, not, seen, as, an, ideal, body, type, and, most, pressure, to, attain, a, slim, figure, may, stem, from, influence, or, exposure, to, western, culture, and, ideology, traditional, african, cultural, ideals, are, reflected, in, the, practice, of, some, health, professionals, in, ghana, pharmacists, sell, appetite, stimulants, to, women, who, desire, to, as, ghanaians, stated, grow, fat, girls, are, told, that, if, they, wish, to, find, a, partner, and, birth, children, they, must, gain, weight, on, the, contrary, there, are, certain, taboos, surrounding, a, slim, body, image, specifically, in, west, africa, lack, of, body, fat, is, linked, to, poverty, and, hiv, aids, however, the, emergence, of, western, and, european, influence, specifically, with, the, introduction, of, such, fashion, and, modelling, shows, and, competitions, is, changing, certain, views, among, body, acceptance, and, the, prevalence, of, eating, disorders, has, consequently, increased, this, acculturation, is, also, related, to, how, south, africa, is, concurrently, undergoing, rapid, intense, urbanization, such, modern, development, is, leading, to, cultural, changes, and, professionals, cite, rates, of, eating, disorders, in, this, region, will, increase, with, urbanization, specifically, with, changes, in, identity, body, image, and, cultural, issues, further, exposure, to, western, values, through, private, caucasian, schools, or, caretakers, is, another, possible, factor, related, to, acculturation, which, may, be, associated, with, the, onset, of, eating, disorders, other, factors, which, are, cited, to, be, related, to, the, increasing, prevalence, of, eating, disorders, in, african, communities, can, be, related, to, sexual, conflicts, such, as, psychosexual, guilt, first, sexual, intercourse, and, pregnancy, traumatic, events, which, are, related, to, both, family, i, e, parental, separation, and, eating, related, issues, are, also, cited, as, possible, effectors, religious, fasting, particularly, around, times, of, stress, and, feelings, of, self, control, are, also, cited, as, determinants, in, the, onset, of, eating, disorders, the, west, plays, a, role, in, asia, s, economic, development, via, foreign, investments, advanced, technologies, joining, financial, markets, and, the, arrival, of, american, and, european, companies, in, asia, especially, through, outsourcing, manufacturing, operations, this, exposure, to, western, culture, especially, the, media, imparts, western, body, ideals, to, asian, society, termed, westernization, in, part, westernization, fosters, eating, disorders, among, asian, populations, however, there, are, also, country, specific, influences, on, the, occurrence, of, eating, disorders, in, asia, in, china, as, well, as, other, asian, countries, westernization, migration, from, rural, to, urban, areas, after, effects, of, sociocultural, events, and, disruptions, of, social, and, emotional, support, are, implicated, in, the, emergence, of, eating, disorders, in, particular, risk, factors, for, eating, disorders, include, higher, socioeconomic, status, preference, for, a, thin, body, ideal, history, of, child, abuse, high, anxiety, levels, hostile, parental, relationships, jealousy, towards, media, idols, and, above, average, scores, on, the, body, dissatisfaction, and, interoceptive, awareness, sections, of, the, eating, disorder, inventory, similarly, to, the, west, researchers, have, identified, the, media, as, a, primary, source, of, pressures, relating, to, physical, appearance, which, may, even, predict, body, change, behaviors, in, males, and, females, while, colonised, by, the, british, in, 1874, fiji, kept, a, large, degree, of, linguistic, and, cultural, diversity, which, characterised, the, ethnic, fijian, population, though, gaining, independence, in, 1970, fiji, has, rejected, western, capitalist, values, which, challenged, its, mutual, trusts, bonds, kinships, and, identity, as, a, nation, similar, to, studies, conducted, on, polynesian, groups, ethnic, fijian, traditional, aesthetic, ideals, reflected, a, preference, for, a, robust, body, shape, thus, the, prevailing, pressure, to, be, slim, thought, to, be, associated, with, diet, and, disordered, eating, in, many, western, societies, was, absent, in, traditional, fiji, additionally, traditional, fijian, values, would, encourage, a, robust, appetite, and, a, widespread, vigilance, for, and, social, response, to, weight, loss, individual, efforts, to, reshape, the, body, by, dieting, or, exercise, thus, traditionally, was, discouraged, however, studies, conducted, in, 1995, and, 1998, both, demonstrated, a, link, between, the, introduction, of, television, in, the, country, and, the, emergence, of, eating, disorders, in, young, adolescent, ethnic, fijian, girls, through, the, quantitative, data, collected, in, these, studies, there, was, found, to, be, a, significant, increase, in, the, prevalence, of, two, key, indicators, of, disordered, eating, self, induced, vomiting, and, high, eating, attitudes, test, 26, these, results, were, recorded, following, prolonged, television, exposure, in, the, community, and, an, associated, increase, in, the, percentage, of, households, owning, television, sets, additionally, qualitative, data, linked, changing, attitudes, about, dieting, weight, loss, and, aesthetic, ideas, in, the, peer, environment, to, western, media, images, the, impact, of, television, was, especially, profound, given, the, longstanding, social, and, cultural, traditions, that, had, previously, rejected, the, notions, of, dieting, purging, and, body, dissatisfaction, in, fiji, additional, studies, in, 2011, found, that, social, network, media, exposure, independent, of, direct, media, and, other, cultural, exposures, was, also, associated, with, eating, pathology, from, the, early, to, mid, 1990s, a, variant, form, of, anorexia, nervosa, was, identified, in, hong, kong, this, variant, form, did, not, share, features, of, anorexia, in, the, west, notably, fat, phobia, and, distorted, body, image, patients, attributed, their, restrictive, food, intake, to, somatic, complaints, such, as, epigastric, bloating, abdominal, or, stomach, pain, or, a, lack, of, hunger, or, appetite, compared, to, western, patients, individuals, with, this, variant, anorexia, demonstrated, bulimic, symptoms, less, frequently, and, tended, to, have, lower, pre, morbid, body, mass, index, this, form, disapproves, the, assumption, that, a, fear, of, fatness, or, weight, gain, is, the, defining, characteristic, of, individuals, with, anorexia, nervosa, in, the, past, the, available, evidence, did, not, suggest, that, unhealthy, weight, loss, methods, and, eating, disordered, behaviors, are, common, in, india, as, proven, by, stagnant, rates, of, clinically, diagnosed, eating, disorders, however, it, appears, that, rates, of, eating, disorders, in, urban, areas, of, india, are, increasing, based, on, surveys, from, psychiatrists, who, were, asked, whether, they, perceived, eating, disorders, to, be, a, serious, clinical, issue, in, india, one, notable, indian, psychiatrist, and, eating, disorder, specialist, dr, udipi, gauthamadas, is, on, record, saying, disturbed, eating, attitudes, and, behaviours, affect, about, 25, to, 40, percent, of, adolescent, girls, and, around, 20, percent, of, adolescent, boys, while, on, one, hand, there, is, increasing, recognition, of, eating, disorders, in, the, country, there, is, also, a, persisting, belief, that, this, illness, is, alien, to, india, this, prevents, many, sufferers, from, seeking, professional, help, 23, 5, of, respondents, believed, that, rates, of, eating, disorders, were, rising, in, bangalore, 26, 5, claimed, that, rates, were, stagnant, and, 42, the, largest, percentage, expressed, uncertainty, it, has, been, suggested, that, urbanization, and, socioeconomic, status, are, associated, with, increased, risk, for, body, weight, dissatisfaction, however, due, to, the, physical, size, of, and, diversity, within, india, trends, may, vary, throughout, the, country, historically, identifying, as, african, american, has, been, considered, a, protective, factor, for, body, dissatisfaction, those, identifying, as, african, american, have, been, found, to, have, a, greater, acceptance, of, larger, body, image, ideals, and, less, internalization, of, the, thin, ideal, and, african, american, women, have, reported, the, lowest, levels, of, body, dissatisfaction, among, the, five, major, racial, ethnic, groups, in, the, us, however, recent, research, contradicts, these, findings, indicating, that, african, american, women, may, exhibit, levels, of, body, dissatisfaction, comparable, to, other, racial, ethnic, minority, groups, in, this, way, just, because, those, who, identify, as, african, american, may, not, internalize, the, thin, ideal, as, strongly, as, other, racial, and, ethnic, groups, it, does, not, mean, that, they, do, not, hold, other, appearance, ideals, that, may, promote, body, shape, concerns, similarly, recent, research, shows, that, african, americans, exhibit, rates, of, disordered, eating, that, are, similar, to, or, even, higher, than, their, white, counterparts, american, indian, and, alaska, native, women, are, more, likely, than, white, women, to, both, experience, a, fear, of, losing, control, over, their, eating, and, to, abuse, laxatives, and, diuretics, for, weight, control, purposes, they, have, comparable, rates, of, binge, eating, and, other, disordered, weight, control, behaviors, in, comparison, to, other, racial, groups, disproportionately, high, rates, of, disordered, eating, and, body, dissatisfaction, have, been, found, in, hispanics, in, comparison, to, other, racial, and, ethnic, groups, studies, have, found, significantly, more, laxative, use, in, those, identifying, as, hispanic, in, comparison, to, non, hispanic, white, counterparts, specifically, those, identifying, as, hispanic, may, be, at, heightened, risk, of, engaging, in, binge, eating, and, bingeing, purging, behaviors, food, insecurity, is, defined, as, inadequate, access, to, sufficient, food, both, in, terms, of, quantity, and, quality, in, direct, contrast, to, food, security, which, is, conceptualized, as, having, access, to, sufficient, safe, and, nutritious, food, to, meet, dietary, needs, and, preferences, notably, levels, of, food, security, exist, on, a, continuum, from, reliable, access, to, food, to, disrupted, access, to, food, multiple, studies, have, found, food, insecurity, to, be, associated, with, eating, pathology, a, study, conducted, on, individuals, visiting, a, food, bank, in, texas, found, higher, food, insecurity, to, be, correlated, with, higher, levels, of, binge, eating, overall, eating, disorder, pathology, dietary, restraint, compensatory, behaviors, and, weight, self, stigma, findings, of, a, replication, study, with, a, larger, more, diverse, sample, mirrored, these, results, and, a, study, looking, at, the, relationship, between, food, insecurity, and, bulimia, nervosa, similarly, found, greater, food, insecurity, to, be, associated, with, elevated, levels, of, eating, pathology, one, study, has, found, that, binge, eating, disorder, may, stem, from, trauma, with, some, female, patients, engaging, in, these, disorders, to, numb, pain, experienced, through, sexual, trauma, there, are, various, forms, of, trauma, that, individuals, may, have, experienced, leading, them, to, cope, through, an, eating, disorder, when, in, pain, individuals, may, attempt, to, exert, control, over, this, aspect, of, their, lives, perceiving, it, as, their, only, means, of, managing, their, life, the, brain, is, a, very, complex, organ, that, tries, its, best, to, help, us, navigate, through, the, hardships, of, life, some, eating, disorder, patients, have, implied, that, enforced, heterosexuality, and, heterosexism, led, many, to, engage, in, their, condition, to, align, with, norms, associated, with, their, gender, identity, families, may, restrict, women, s, food, intake, to, keep, them, thin, thus, increasing, their, ability, to, attain, a, male, romantic, partner, according, to, pritts, and, susman, the, medical, history, is, the, most, powerful, tool, for, diagnosing, eating, disorders, there, are, many, medical, disorders, that, mimic, eating, disorders, and, comorbid, psychiatric, disorders, early, detection, and, intervention, can, assure, a, better, recovery, and, can, improve, a, lot, the, quality, of, life, of, these, patients, in, the, past, 30, years, eating, disorders, have, become, increasingly, conspicuous, and, it, is, uncertain, whether, the, changes, in, presentation, reflect, a, true, increase, anorexia, nervosa, and, bulimia, nervosa, are, the, most, clearly, defined, subgroups, of, a, wider, range, of, eating, disorders, many, patients, present, with, subthreshold, expressions, of, the, two, main, diagnoses, others, with, different, patterns, and, symptoms, as, eating, disorders, especially, anorexia, nervosa, are, thought, of, as, being, associated, with, young, white, females, diagnosis, of, eating, disorders, in, other, races, happens, more, rarely, in, one, study, when, clinicians, were, presented, with, identical, case, studies, demonstrating, disordered, eating, symptoms, in, black, hispanic, and, white, women, 44, noted, the, white, woman, s, behavior, as, problematic, 41, identified, the, hispanic, woman, s, behavior, as, problematic, and, only, 17, of, the, clinicians, noted, the, black, woman, s, behavior, as, problematic, gordon, brattole, wingate, joiner, 2006, the, diagnostic, workup, typically, includes, complete, medical, and, psychosocial, history, and, follows, a, rational, and, formulaic, approach, to, the, diagnosis, neuroimaging, using, fmri, mri, pet, and, spect, scans, have, been, used, to, detect, cases, in, which, a, lesion, tumor, or, other, organic, condition, has, been, either, the, sole, causative, or, contributory, factor, in, an, eating, disorder, right, frontal, intracerebral, lesions, with, their, close, relationship, to, the, limbic, system, could, be, causative, for, eating, disorders, we, therefore, recommend, performing, a, cranial, mri, in, all, patients, with, suspected, eating, disorders, trummer, m, et, al, 2002, intracranial, pathology, should, also, be, considered, however, certain, is, the, diagnosis, of, early, onset, anorexia, nervosa, second, neuroimaging, plays, an, important, part, in, diagnosing, early, onset, anorexia, nervosa, both, from, a, clinical, and, a, research, prospective, o, brien, et, al, 2001, after, ruling, out, organic, causes, and, the, initial, diagnosis, of, an, eating, disorder, being, made, by, a, medical, professional,

conditions, the, clinician, conducts, a, clinical, interview, and, may, employ, various, psychometric, tests, some, are, general, in, nature, while, others, were, devised, specifically, for, use, in, the, assessment, of, eating, disorders, some, of, the, general, tests, that, may, be, used, are, the, hamilton, depression, rating, scale, and, the, beck, depression, inventory, longitudinal, research, showed, that, there, is, an, increase, in, chance, that, a, young, adult, female, would, develop, bulimia, due, to, their, current, psychological, pressure, and, as, the, person, ages, and, matures, their, emotional, problems, change, or, are, resolved, and, then, the, symptoms, decline, several, types, of, scales, are, currently, used, a, self, report, questionnaires, edi, 3, bsq, tfeq,

accurate, scales, and, telemedicine, testing, and, diagnosis, tools, are, of, high, importance, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, leti, garner, al, 2020, there, are, multiple, medical, conditions, which, may, be, misdiagnosed, as, a, primary, psychiatric, disorder, complicating, or, delaying, treatment, these, may, have, a, synergistic, effect, on, conditions, which, mimic, an, eating,

children, with, anorexia, the, only, well, established, treatment, is, the, family, treatment, behavior, for, other, eating, disorders, in, children, however, there, is, no, well, established, treatments, though, family, treatment, behavior, has, been, used, in, treating, bulimia, a, 2019, cochrane, review, examined, studies, comparing, the, effectiveness, of, inpatient, versus, outpatient, models, of, care, for, eating, disorders, four, trials, including, 511, participants, were, studied, but, the, review, was, unable, to, draw, any, definitive, conclusions, as, to, the, superiority, of, one, model, over, another, a, variety, of, barriers, to, eating, disorder, treatment, have, been, identified, typically, grouped, into, individual, and, systemic, barriers, individual, barriers, include, shame, fear, of, stigma, cultural, perceptions, minimizing, the, seriousness, of, the, problem, unfamiliarity, with, mental, health, services, and, a, lack, of, trust, in, mental, health, professionals, systemic, barriers, include, language, differences, financial, limitations, lack, of, insurance, coverage, inaccessible, health, care, facilities, time, conflicts, long, waits, lack, of, transportation, and, lack, of, child, care, these, barriers, may, be, particularly, exacerbated, for, those, who, identify, outside, of, the, skinny, white, affluent, girl, stereotype, that, dominates, in, the, field, of, eating, disorders, such, that, those, who, do, not, identify, with, this, stereotype, are, much, less, likely, to, seek, treatment, conditions, during, the, covid, 19,

and, stressful, to, obtain, needed, resources, including, food, and, medical, treatment, the, covid, 19, pandemic, in, england, exposed, a, dramatic, rise, in, demand, for, eating, disorder, services, which, the, english, nhs, struggled, to, meet, the, national, institute, for, health, and, care, excellence, and, nhs, england, both, advised, that, services, should, not, impose, thresholds, using, body, mass, index, or, duration, of, illness, to, determine, whether, treatment, for, eating, disorders, should, be, offered, but, there, were, continuing, reports, that, these, recommendations, were, not, followed, in, terms, of, access, to, treatment, therapy, sessions, have, generally, switched, from, in, person, to, video, calls, this, may, actually, help, people, who, previously, had, difficulty, finding, a, therapist, with, experience, in, treating, eating, disorders, for, example, those, who, live, in, rural, areas, studies, suggest, that, virtual, telehealth, cbt, can, be, as, effective, as, face, to, face, cbt, for, bulimia, and, other, mental, illnesses, to, help, patients, cope, with, conditions, during, the, pandemic, therapists, may, have, to, particularly, emphasize,

50, and, 85, with, larger, proportions, of, people, experiencing, at, least, partial, remission, it, can, be, a, lifelong, struggle, or, it, can, be, overcome, within, months, anorexia, symptoms, include, the, increasing, chance, of, getting, osteoporosis, thinning, of, the, hair, as, well, as, dry, hair, and, skin, are, also, very, common, the, muscles, of, the, heart, will, also, start, to,
