urology, from, greek, ouron, urine, and, logia, study, of, also, known, as, genitourinary, surgery, is, the, branch, of, medicine, that, focuses, on, surgical, and, medical, diseases, of, the, urinary, system, and, the, reproductive, organs, organs, under, the, domain, of, urology, include, the, kidneys, adrenal, glands, ureters, urinary, bladder, urethra, and, the, male, reproductive, organs, testes, epididymides, vasa, deferentia, seminal, vesicles, prostate, and, penis, the, urinary, and, reproductive, tracts, are, closely, linked, and, disorders, of, one, often, affect, the, other, thus, a, major, spectrum, of, the, conditions, managed, in, urology, exists, under, the, domain, of, genitourinary, disorders, urology, combines, the, management, of, medical, i, e, non, surgical, conditions, such, as, urinary, tract, infections, and, benign, prostatic, hyperplasia, with, the, management, of, surgical, conditions, such, as, bladder, or, prostate, cancer, kidney, stones, congenital, abnormalities, traumatic, injury, and, stress, incontinence, urological, techniques, include, minimally, invasive, robotic, and, laparoscopic, surgery, laser, assisted, surgeries, and, other, scope, guided, procedures, urologists, receive, training, in, open, and, minimally, invasive, surgical, techniques, employing, real, time, ultrasound, guidance, fiber, optic, endoscopic, equipment, and, various, lasers, in, the, treatment, of, multiple, benign, and, malignant, conditions, urology, is, closely, related, to, and, urologists, often, collaborate, with, the, practitioners, of, oncology, nephrology, gynaecology, andrology, pediatric, surgery, colorectal, surgery, gastroenterology, and, endocrinology, urology, is, one, of, the, most, competitive, and, highly, sought, surgical, specialties, for, physicians, with, new, urologists, comprising, less, than, 1, 5, of, united, states, medical, school, graduates, each, year, urologists, are, physicians, which, have, specialized, in, the, field, after, completing, their, general, degree, in, medicine, upon, successful, completion, of, a, residency, program, many, urologists, choose, to, undergo, further, advanced, training, in, a, subspecialty, area, of, expertise, through, a, fellowship, lasting, an, additional, 12, to, 36, months, subspecialties, may, include, urologic, surgery, urologic, oncology, and, urologic, oncological, surgery, endourology, and, endourologic, surgery, urogynecology, and, urogynecologic, surgery, reconstructive, urologic, surgery, a, form, of, reconstructive, surgery, minimally, invasive, urologic, surgery, pediatric, urology, and, pediatric, urologic, surgery, including, adolescent, urology, the, treatment, of, premature, or, delayed, puberty, and, the, treatment, of, congenital, urological, syndromes, malformations, and, deformations, transplant, urology, the, field, of, transplant, medicine, and, surgery, concerned, with, transplantation, of, organs, such, as, the, kidneys, bladder, tissue, ureters, and, recently, penises, voiding, dysfunction, paruresis, neurourology, and, androurology, and, sexual, medicine, additionally, some, urologists, supplement, their, fellowships, with, a, master, s, degree, 2, 3, years, or, with, a, ph, d, 4, 6, years, in, related, topics, to, prepare, them, for, academic, as, well, as, focused, clinical, employment, as, of, 2022, there, are, 146, residency, programs, that, offered, 356, categorical, positions, urology, is, one, of, the, early, match, programs, with, results, given, to, applicants, by, early, february, 6, weeks, before, nrmp, match, applications, are, accepted, starting, sep, 1, with, some, programs, accepting, applications, until, early, jan, it, is, a, relatively, competitive, specialty,

more, difficult, for, imgs, and, students, who, have, a, year, or, more, off, before, residency, match, rates, were, 27, and, 55, respectively, in, 2012, the, medical, school, environment, may, also, be, a, factor, a, study, in, 2012, also, showed, after, an, analysis, of, match, rates, from, schools, between, 2005, and, 2009, that, 20, schools, sent, more, than, 15, students, into, urology, 1, standard, deviation, above, the, median, with, northwestern, university, sending, 44, students, over, those, five, years, after, urology, residency, there, are, seven, subspecialties, recognized, by, the, aua, american, urological, association, training, is, completed, through, the, royal, australasian, college, of, surgeons, racs, the, program, requires, six, years, of, full, time, training, for,

university, and, kathmandu, university, as, well, as, two, autonomous, institutes, bp, koirala, institute, of, health, sciences, and, national, academy, of, medical, sciences, bir, hospital, run, the, mch, urology, programme, this, degree, is, equivalent, to, clinical, phd, and, called, as, chikitsa, bidhyabaridhi, by, tribhuvan, university, government, university, and, is, considered, to, be, the, highest, degree, among, the, surgical, discipline, degrees, in, ethiopia, in, 2001, there, were, only, five, qualified, urologists, all, trained, abroad, in, countries, like, india, tanzania, and, hungary, before, this, chapter, all, urology, cases, were, managed, by, general, surgeons, the, only, urological, unit, in, the, country, was, at, tikur, anbessa, tertiary, hospital, the, services, provided, included, eswl, and, endo, urology, the, urology, training, program, was, started, in, 2009, with, a, curriculum, for, general, surgeons, which, had, a, three, year, training, program, up, to, 2019, six, urologists, have, graduated, by, this, program, for, general, surgeons, the, first, residency, program, started, accepting, general, practitioners, in, 2010, for, a, five, year, program, the, first, two, years, were, trainings, in, general, surgery, the, next, three, years, were, dedicated, urology, training, program, which, included, the, same, three, year, training, as, of, the, general, surgeons, three, year, curriculum, it, started, with, two, residents, who, graduated, in, 2015, with, a, certificate, in, specialty, of, urology, up, to, 2019, seventeen, urologists, have, graduated, from, this, five, year, residency, program, from, the, start, these, programs, in, 2009, up, to, 2019, a, total, of, 23, urologists, have, been, trained, in, tikur, anbessa, tertioary, hospital, as, of, 2020, there, were, 26, trainees, in, the, programme, all, of, the, urologists, who, graduated, from, tikur, anbessa, tertioary, hospital, were, as, of, 2020, working, in, different, parts, of, the, country, as, a, medical, discipline, that, involves, the, care, of, many, organs, and, physiological, systems, urology, can, be, broken, down, into, several, subdisciplines, at, many, larger, academic, centers, and, university, hospitals, that, excel, in, patient, care, and, clinical, research, urologists, often, specialize, in, a, particular, sub, discipline, endourology, is, the, branch, of, urology, that, deals, with, the, closed, manipulation, of, the, urinary, tract, it, has, lately, grown, to, include, all, minimally, invasive, urologic, surgical, procedures, as, opposed, to, open, surgery, endourology, is, performed, using, small, cameras, and, instruments, inserted, into, the, urinary, tract, transurethral, surgery, has, been, the, cornerstone, of, endourology, most, of, the, urinary, tract, can, be, reached, via, the, urethra, enabling, prostate, surgery, surgery, of, tumors, of, the, urothelium, stone, surgery, and, simple, urethral, and, ureteral, procedures, recently, the, addition, of, laparoscopy, and, robotics, has, further, subdivided, this, branch, of, urology, laparoscopy, is, a, rapidly, evolving, branch, of, urology, and, has, replaced, some, open, surgical, procedures, robot, assisted, surgery, of, the, prostate, kidney, and, ureter, has, been, expanding, this, field, today, many, prostatectomies, in, the, united, states, are, carried, out, by, so, called, robotic, assistance, this, has, created, controversy, however, as, robotics, greatly, increase, the, cost, of, surgery, and, the, benefit, for, the, patient, may, or, may, not, be, proportional, to, the, extra, cost, moreover, current, 2011, market, situation, for, robotic, equipment, is, a, de, facto, monopoly, of, one, publicly, held, corporation, which, further, fuels, the, cost, effectiveness, controversy, urologic, oncology, concerns, the, surgical, treatment, of, malignant, genitourinary, diseases, such, as, cancer, of, the, prostate, adrenal, glands, bladder, kidneys, ureters, testicles, and, penis, as, well, as, the, skin, and, subcutaneous, tissue, and, muscle, and, fascia, of, those, areas, that, particular, subspecialty, overlaps, with, dermatological, oncology, and, related, areas, of, oncology, the, treatment, of, genitourinary, cancer, is, managed, by, either, a, urologist, or, an, oncologist, depending, on, the, treatment, type, surgical, or, medical, most, urologic, oncologists, in, western, countries, use, minimally, invasive, techniques, laparoscopy, or, endourology, robotic, assisted, surgery, to, manage, urologic, cancers, amenable, to, surgical, management, neurourology, concerns, nervous, system, control, of, the, genitourinary, system, and, of, conditions, causing, abnormal, urination, neurological, diseases, and, disorders, such, as, a, stroke, multiple, sclerosis, parkinson, s, disease, and, spinal, cord, injury, can, disrupt, the, lower, urinary, tract, and, result, in, conditions, such, as, urinary, incontinence, detrusor, overactivity, urinary, retention, and, detrusor, sphincter, dyssynergia, urodynamic, studies, play, an, important, diagnostic, role, in, neurourology, therapy, for, nervous, system, disorders, includes, clean, intermittent, self, catheterization, of, the, bladder, anticholinergic, drugs, injection, of, botulinum, toxin, into, the, bladder, wall, and, advanced, and, less, commonly, used, therapies, such, as, sacral, neuromodulation, less, marked, neurological, abnormalities, can, cause, urological, disorders, as, well, for, example, abnormalities, of, the, sensory, nervous, system, are, thought, by, many, researchers, to, play, a, role, in, disorders, of, painful, or, frequent, urination, e, g, painful, bladder, syndrome, also, known, as, interstitial, cystitis, pediatric, urology, concerns, urologic, disorders, in, children, such, disorders, include, cryptorchidism, undescended, testes, congenital, abnormalities, of, the, genitourinary, tract, enuresis, underdeveloped, genitalia, due, to, delayed, growth, or, delayed, puberty, often, an, endocrinological, problem, and, vesicoureteral, reflux, andrology, is, the, medical, specialty, that, deals, with, male, health, particularly, relating, to, the, problems, of, the, male, reproductive, system, and, urological, problems, that, are, unique, to, men, such, as, prostate, cancer, male, fertility, problems, and, surgery, of, the, male, reproductive, system, it, is, the, counterpart, to, gynaecology, which, deals, with, medical, issues, that, are, specific, to, female, health, especially, reproductive, and, urologic, health, reconstructive, urology, is, a, highly, specialized, field, of, male, urology, that, restores, both, structure, and, function, to, the, genitourinary, tract, prostate, procedures, full, or, partial, hysterectomies, trauma, auto, accidents, gunshot, wounds, industrial, accidents, straddle, injuries, etc, disease, obstructions, blockages, e, g, urethral, strictures, and, occasionally, childbirth, can, necessitate, reconstructive, surgery, the, urinary, bladder, ureters, the, tubes, that, lead, from, the, kidneys, to, the, urinary, bladder, and, genitalia, are, other, examples, of, reconstructive, urology, female, urology, is, a, branch, of, urology, dealing, with, overactive, bladder, pelvic, organ, prolapse, and, urinary, incontinence, many, of, these, physicians, also, practice, neurourology, and, reconstructive, urology, as, mentioned, above, female, urologists, many, of, whom, are, men, complete, a, 1, 3, year, fellowship, after, completion, of, a, 5, 6, year, urology, residency, thorough, knowledge, of, the, female, pelvic, floor, together, with, intimate, understanding, of, the, physiology, and, pathology, of, voiding, are, necessary, to, diagnose, and, treat, these, disorders, depending, on, the, cause, of, the, individual, problem, a, medical, or, surgical, treatment, can, be, the, solution, their, field, of, practice, heavily, overlaps, with, that, of, urogynecologists, physicians, in, a, sub, discipline, of, gynecology, who, have, done, a, three, year, fellowship, after, a, four, year, obgyn, residency, there, are, a, number, of, peer, reviewed, journals, and, publications, about, urology, including, the, journal, of, urology, european, urology, the, african, journal, of, urology, british, journal, of, urology, international, bmc, urology, indian, journal, of, urology, nature, reviews, urology, and, urology, there, are, national, organizations, such, as, the, american, urological, association, the, american, association, of, clinical, urologists, european, association, of, urology, the, large, urology, group, practice, association, lugpa, and, the, society, for, basic, urologic, research, urology, is, also, included, under, the, auspices, of, the, international, continence, society, teaching, organizations, include, the, european, board, of, urology, as, well, as, the, vattikuti, urology, institute, in, detroit, which, also, hosts, an, annual, international, robotic, urology, symposium, devoted, to, new, technologies, the, american, non, profit, ivumed, teaches, urology, in, developing, countries
