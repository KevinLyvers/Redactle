in, biology, a, nymph, from, ancient, greek, n, mph, meaning, bride, is, the, juvenile, form, of, some, invertebrates, particularly, insects, which, undergoes, gradual, metamorphosis, hemimetabolism, before, reaching, its, adult, stage, unlike, a, typical, larva, a, nymph, s, overall, form, already, resembles, that, of, the, adult, except, for, a, lack, of, wings, in, winged, species, and, the, emergence, of, genitalia, in, addition, while, a, nymph, moults, it, never, enters, a, pupal, stage, instead, the, final, moult, results, in, an, adult, insect, nymphs, undergo, multiple, stages, of, development, called, instars, many, species, of, arthropods, have, nymph, stages, this, includes, the, orders, orthoptera, crickets, grasshoppers, and, locusts, hemiptera, cicadas, shield, bugs, whiteflies, aphids, leafhoppers, froghoppers, treehoppers, mayflies, termites, cockroaches, mantises, stoneflies, and, odonata, dragonflies, and, damselflies, nymphs, of, aquatic, insects, as, in, the, odonata, ephemeroptera, and, plecoptera, orders, are, also, called, naiads, an, ancient, greek, name, for, mythological, water, nymphs, some, entomologists, have, said, that, the, terms, larva, nymph, and, naiad, should, be, used, according, to, the, developmental, mode, classification, hemimetabolous, paurometabolous, or, holometabolous, but, others, have, pointed, out, that, there, is, no, real, confusion, in, older, literature, these, were, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, heterometabolous, insects, as, their, adult, and, immature, stages, live, in, different, environments, terrestrial, vs, aquatic, in, 1628, english, physician, william, harvey, published, an, anatomical, disquisition, on, the, motion, of, the, heart, and, blood, in, animals, in, his, writing, harvey, hypothesized, that, the, pupal, stage, in, insects, was, the, result, of, imperfect, eggs, while, some, eggs, produced, smaller, versions, of, fully, matured, insects, known, as, nymphs, others, created, intermediate, forms, thus, these, intermediate, forms, must, go, through, a, second, egg, stage, to, reach, their, adult, form, this, hypothesis, attempts, to, explain, the, developmental, differences, between, hemimetabolous, and, holometabolous, metamorphosis, though, there, is, little, evidence, supporting, harvey, s, hypothesis, it, is, still, significant, to, modern, research, in, nymphs, in, fly, fishing, with, artificial, flies, this, stage, of, aquatic, insects, is, the, basis, for, an, entire, series, of, representative, patterns, for, trout, they, account, for, over, half, of, the, fishing, fly, patterns, regularly, used, in, the, united, states
