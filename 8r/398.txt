hemiptera, h, m, p, t, r, from, ancient, greek, hemipterus, half, winged, is, an, order, of, insects, commonly, called, true, bugs, comprising, over, 80, 000, species, within, groups, such, as, the, cicadas, aphids, planthoppers, leafhoppers, assassin, bugs, bed, bugs, and, shield, bugs, they, range, in, size, from, 1, mm, 0, 04, in, to, around, 15, cm, 6, in, and, share, a, common, arrangement, of, piercing, sucking, mouthparts, the, name, true, bugs, is, often, limited, to, the, suborder, heteroptera, entomologists, reserve, the, term, bug, for, hemiptera, or, heteroptera, which, does, not, include, other, arthropods, or, insects, of, other, orders, such, as, ants, bees, beetles, or, butterflies, in, some, varieties, of, english, all, terrestrial, arthropods, including, non, insect, arachnids, and, myriapods, also, fall, under, the, colloquial, understanding, of, bug, many, insects, with, bug, in, their, common, name, especially, in, american, english, belong, to, other, orders, for, example, the, lovebug, is, a, fly, and, the, maybug, and, ladybug, are, beetles, the, term, is, occasionally, extended, to, colloquial, names, for, freshwater, or, marine, crustaceans, e, g, balmain, bug, moreton, bay, bug, mudbug, and, used, by, physicians, and, bacteriologists, for, disease, causing, germs, e, g, superbugs, most, hemipterans, feed, on, plants, using, their, sucking, and, piercing, mouthparts, to, extract, plant, sap, some, are, bloodsucking, or, hematophagous, while, others, are, predators, that, feed, on, other, insects, or, small, invertebrates, they, live, in, a, wide, variety, of, habitats, generally, terrestrial, though, some, are, adapted, to, life, in, or, on, the, surface, of, fresh, water, e, g, pondskaters, water, boatmen, giant, water, bugs, hemipterans, are, hemimetabolous, with, young, nymphs, that, somewhat, resemble, adults, many, aphids, are, capable, of, parthenogenesis, producing, young, from, unfertilised, eggs, this, helps, them, to, reproduce, extremely, rapidly, in, favourable, conditions, humans, have, interacted, with, the, hemiptera, for, millennia, some, species, including, many, aphids, are, significant, agricultural, pests, damaging, crops, by, sucking, the, sap, others, harm, humans, more, directly, as, vectors, of, serious, viral, diseases, the, bed, bug, is, a, persistent, parasite, of, humans, and, some, kissing, bugs, can, transmit, chagas, disease, some, species, have, been, used, for, biological, control, of, insect, pests, or, of, invasive, plants, a, few, hemipterans, have, been, cultivated, for, the, extraction, of, dyestuffs, such, as, cochineal, and, carmine, and, for, shellac, cicadas, have, been, used, as, food, and, have, appeared, in, literature, since, the, iliad, in, ancient, greece, hemiptera, is, the, largest, order, of, hemimetabolous, insects, not, undergoing, complete, metamorphosis, though, some, examples, such, as, male, scale, insects, do, undergo, a, form, of, complete, metamorphosis, containing, over, 95, 000, named, species, other, insect, orders, with, more, species, are, all, holometabolous, meaning, they, have, a, pupal, stage, and, undergo, complete, metamorphosis, the, majority, of, species, are, terrestrial, including, a, number, of, important, agricultural, pests, but, some, are, found, in, freshwater, habitats, these, include, the, water, boatmen, backswimmers, pond, skaters, and, giant, water, bugs, hemiptera, belong, to, the, insect, superorder, paraneoptera, which, includes, lice, psocodea, thrips, thysanoptera, and, the, true, bugs, of, hemiptera, within, paraneoptera, hemiptera, is, most, closely, related, to, the, sister, clade, thysanoptera, the, fossil, record, of, hemipterans, goes, back, to, the, carboniferous, moscovian, the, oldest, fossils, are, of, the, archescytinidae, from, the, lower, permian, and, are, thought, to, be, basal, to, the, auchenorrhyncha, fulgoromorpha, and, cicadomorpha, appear, in, the, upper, permian, as, do, sternorrhyncha, of, the, psylloidea, and, aleyrodoidea, aphids, and, coccoids, appear, in, the, triassic, the, coleorrhyncha, extend, back, to, the, lower, jurassic, the, heteroptera, first, appeared, in, the, triassic, the, present, members, of, the, order, hemiptera, sometimes, referred, to, as, rhynchota, were, historically, placed, into, two, orders, the, so, called, homoptera, and, heteroptera, hemiptera, based, on, differences, in, wing, structure, and, the, position, of, the, rostrum, homoptera, was, established, as, paraphyletic, group, and, an, obsolete, name, the, order, is, now, divided, into, four, suborders, heteroptera, sternorrhyncha, auchenorrhyncha, and, coleorrhyncha, the, earlier, work, was, based, on, nuclear, dna, but, later, phylogenetic, analysis, using, mitochondrial, dna, suggests, that, homoptera, may, be, monophyletic, after, all, a, sister, group, of, heteroptera, the, cause, of, the, disparity, in, the, analyses, is, suggested, to, be, the, long, branch, attraction, effect, in, phylogenetic, analysis, due, to, rapidly, evolving, dna, regions, the, cladogram, shows, hemiptera, s, placement, within, paraneoptera, as, well, as, how, hemiptera, s, four, suborders, are, related, english, names, are, given, in, parentheses, where, possible, other, insects, trogiomorpha, granary, booklice, and, relatives, psocomorpha, barklice, amphientometae, sphaeropsocidae, liposcelididae, booklice, phthiraptera, lice, thysanoptera, thrips, sternorrhyncha, aphids, heteroptera, shield, bugs, assassin, bugs, etc, coleorrhyncha, moss, bugs, fulgoromorpha, planthoppers, cicadomorpha, cicadas, leafhoppers, spittlebugs, etc, the, defining, feature, of, hemipterans, is, their, beak, in, which, the, modified, mandibles, and, maxillae, form, a, stylet, which, is, sheathed, within, a, modified, labium, the, stylet, is, capable, of, piercing, tissues, and, sucking, liquids, while, the, labium, supports, it, the, stylet, contains, a, channel, for, the, outward, movement, of, saliva, and, another, for, the, inward, movement, of, liquid, food, a, salivary, pump, drives, saliva, into, the, prey, a, cibarial, pump, extracts, liquid, from, the, prey, both, pumps, are, powered, by, substantial, dilator, muscles, in, the, head, the, beak, is, usually, folded, under, the, body, when, not, in, use, the, diet, is, typically, plant, sap, but, some, hemipterans, such, as, assassin, bugs, are, predators, both, herbivorous, and, predatory, hemipterans, inject, enzymes, to, begin, digestion, extra, orally, before, the, food, is, taken, into, the, body, these, enzymes, include, amylase, to, hydrolyse, starch, polygalacturonase, to, weaken, the, tough, cell, walls, of, plants, and, proteinases, to, break, down, proteins, although, the, hemiptera, vary, widely, in, their, overall, form, their, mouthparts, form, a, distinctive, rostrum, other, insect, orders, with, mouthparts, modified, into, anything, like, the, rostrum, and, stylets, of, the, hemiptera, include, some, phthiraptera, but, for, other, reasons, they, generally, are, easy, to, recognize, as, non, hemipteran, similarly, the, mouthparts, of, siphonaptera, some, diptera, and, thysanoptera, superficially, resemble, the, rostrum, of, the, hemiptera, but, on, closer, inspection, the, differences, are, considerable, aside, from, the, mouthparts, various, other, insects, can, be, confused, with, hemiptera, but, they, all, have, biting, mandibles, and, maxillae, instead, of, the, rostrum, examples, include, cockroaches, and, psocids, both, of, which, have, longer, many, segmented, antennae, and, some, beetles, but, these, have, fully, hardened, forewings, which, do, not, overlap, the, forewings, of, hemiptera, are, either, entirely, membranous, as, in, the, sternorrhyncha, and, auchenorrhyncha, or, partially, hardened, as, in, most, heteroptera, the, name, hemiptera, is, from, the, greek, hemi, half, and, pteron, wing, referring, to, the, forewings, of, many, heteropterans, which, are, hardened, near, the, base, but, membranous, at, the, ends, wings, modified, in, this, manner, are, termed, hemelytra, singular, hemelytron, by, analogy, with, the, completely, hardened, elytra, of, beetles, and, occur, only, in, the, suborder, heteroptera, in, all, suborders, the, hindwings, if, present, at, all, are, entirely, membranous, and, usually, shorter, than, the, forewings, the, forewings, may, be, held, roofwise, over, the, body, typical, of, sternorrhyncha, and, auchenorrhyncha, or, held, flat, on, the, back, with, the, ends, overlapping, typical, of, heteroptera, the, antennae, in, hemiptera, typically, consist, of, four, or, five, segments, although, they, can, still, be, quite, long, and, the, tarsi, of, the, legs, have, two, or, three, segments, many, hemipterans, can, produce, sound, for, communication, the, song, of, male, cicadas, the, loudest, of, any, insect, is, produced, by, tymbal, organs, on, the, underside, of, the, abdomen, and, is, used, to, attract, mates, the, tymbals, are, drumlike, disks, of, cuticle, which, are, clicked, in, and, out, repeatedly, making, a, sound, in, the, same, way, as, popping, the, metal, lid, of, a, jam, jar, in, and, out, stridulatory, sounds, are, produced, among, the, aquatic, corixidae, and, notonectidae, backswimmers, using, tibial, combs, rubbed, across, rostral, ridges, hemipterans, are, hemimetabolous, meaning, that, they, do, not, undergo, metamorphosis, the, complete, change, of, form, between, a, larval, phase, and, an, adult, phase, instead, their, young, are, called, nymphs, and, resemble, the, adults, to, a, greater, or, lesser, degree, the, nymphs, moult, several, times, as, they, grow, and, each, instar, resembles, the, adult, more, than, the, previous, one, wing, buds, grow, in, later, stage, nymphs, the, final, transformation, involves, little, more, than, the, development, of, functional, wings, if, they, are, present, at, all, and, functioning, sexual, organs, with, no, intervening, pupal, stage, as, in, holometabolous, insects, many, aphids, are, parthenogenetic, during, part, of, the, life, cycle, such, that, females, can, produce, unfertilized, eggs, which, are, clones, of, their, mother, all, such, young, are, females, thelytoky, so, 100, of, the, population, at, these, times, can, produce, more, offspring, many, species, of, aphid, are, also, viviparous, the, young, are, born, live, rather, than, laid, as, eggs, these, adaptations, enable, aphids, to, reproduce, extremely, rapidly, when, conditions, are, suitable, hemipterans, make, use, of, a, variety, of, modes, of, locomotion, including, swimming, skating, on, a, water, surface, and, jumping, as, well, as, walking, and, flying, like, other, insects, several, families, of, heteroptera, are, water, bugs, adapted, to, an, aquatic, lifestyle, such, as, the, water, boatmen, corixidae, water, scorpions, nepidae, and, backswimmers, notonectidae, they, are, mostly, predatory, and, have, legs, adapted, as, paddles, to, help, the, animal, move, through, the, water, the, pondskaters, or, water, striders, gerridae, are, also, associated, with, water, but, use, the, surface, tension, of, standing, water, to, keep, them, above, the, surface, they, include, the, sea, skaters, in, the, genus, halobates, the, only, truly, marine, group, of, insects, marangoni, effect, propulsion, exploits, the, change, in, surface, tension, when, a, soap, like, surfactant, is, released, on, to, a, water, surface, in, the, same, way, that, a, toy, soap, boat, propels, itself, water, bugs, in, the, genus, microvelia, veliidae, can, travel, at, up, to, 17, cm, s, twice, as, fast, as, they, can, walk, by, this, means, flight, is, well, developed, in, the, hemiptera, although, mostly, used, for, short, distance, movement, and, dispersal, wing, development, is, sometimes, related, to, environmental, conditions, in, some, groups, of, hemiptera, there, are, variations, of, winged, short, winged, and, wingless, forms, within, a, single, species, this, kind, of, polymorphism, tends, to, be, helpful, when, habitats, are, temporary, with, more, energy, put, into, reproduction, when, food, is, available, and, into, dispersal, through, flight, when, food, becomes, scarce, in, aphids, both, winged, and, wingless, forms, occur, with, winged, forms, produced, in, greater, numbers, when, food, resources, are, depleted, aphids, and, whiteflies, can, sometimes, be, transported, very, long, distances, by, atmospheric, updrafts, and, high, altitude, winds, wing, length, polymorphism, is, notably, rare, in, tree, living, hemiptera, many, auchenorrhyncha, including, representatives, of, the, cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, and, froghoppers, are, adapted, for, jumping, saltation, treehoppers, for, example, jump, by, rapidly, depressing, their, hind, legs, before, jumping, the, hind, legs, are, raised, and, the, femora, are, pressed, tightly, into, curved, indentations, in, the, coxae, treehoppers, can, attain, a, take, off, velocity, of, up, to, 2, 7, metres, per, second, and, an, acceleration, of, up, to, 250, g, the, instantaneous, power, output, is, much, greater, than, that, of, normal, muscle, implying, that, energy, is, stored, and, released, to, catapult, the, insect, into, the, air, cicadas, which, are, much, larger, extend, their, hind, legs, for, a, jump, in, under, a, millisecond, again, implying, elastic, storage, of, energy, for, sudden, release, instead, of, relying, on, any, form, of, locomotion, most, sternorrhyncha, females, are, sedentary, or, completely, sessile, attached, to, their, host, plants, by, their, thin, feeding, stylets, which, cannot, be, taken, out, of, the, plant, quickly, most, hemipterans, are, phytophagous, using, their, sucking, and, piercing, mouthparts, to, feed, on, plant, sap, these, include, cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, froghoppers, aphids, whiteflies, scale, insects, and, some, other, groups, some, are, monophages, being, host, specific, and, only, found, on, one, plant, taxon, others, are, oligophages, feeding, on, a, few, plant, groups, while, others, again, are, less, discriminating, polyphages, and, feed, on, many, species, of, plant, the, relationship, between, hemipterans, and, plants, appears, to, be, ancient, with, piercing, and, sucking, of, plants, evident, in, the, early, devonian, period, hemipterans, can, dramatically, cut, the, mass, of, affected, plants, especially, in, major, outbreaks, they, sometimes, also, change, the, mix, of, plants, by, predation, on, seeds, or, feeding, on, roots, of, certain, species, some, sap, suckers, move, from, one, host, to, another, at, different, times, of, year, many, aphids, spend, the, winter, as, eggs, on, a, woody, host, plant, and, the, summer, as, parthenogenetically, reproducing, females, on, a, herbaceous, plant, phloem, sap, which, has, a, higher, concentration, of, sugars, and, nitrogen, is, under, positive, pressure, unlike, the, more, dilute, xylem, sap, most, of, the, sternorrhyncha, and, a, number, of, auchenorrhynchan, groups, feed, on, phloem, phloem, feeding, is, common, in, the, fulgoromorpha, most, cicadellidae, and, in, the, heteroptera, the, typhlocybine, cicadellids, specialize, in, feeding, on, non, vascular, mesophyll, tissue, of, leaves, which, is, more, nutritious, than, the, leaf, epidermis, most, heteroptera, also, feed, on, mesophyll, tissue, where, they, are, more, likely, to, encounter, defensive, secondary, plant, metabolites, which, often, leads, to, the, evolution, of, host, specificity, obligate, xylem, feeding, is, a, special, habit, that, is, found, in, the, auchenorrhyncha, among, cicadoidea, cercopoidea, and, in, cicadelline, cicadellids, some, phloem, feeders, may, take, to, xylem, sap, facultatively, especially, when, facing, dehydration, xylem, feeders, tend, to, be, polyphagous, to, overcome, the, negative, pressure, of, xylem, requires, a, special, cibarial, pump, phloem, feeding, hemiptera, typically, have, symbiotic, micro, organisms, in, their, gut, that, help, to, convert, amino, acids, phloem, feeders, produce, honeydew, from, their, anus, a, variety, of, organisms, that, feed, on, honeydew, form, symbiotic, associations, with, phloem, feeders, phloem, sap, is, a, sugary, liquid, low, in, amino, acids, so, insects, have, to, process, large, quantities, to, meet, their, nutritional, requirements, xylem, sap, is, even, lower, in, amino, acids, and, contains, monosaccharides, rather, than, sucrose, as, well, as, organic, acids, and, minerals, no, digestion, is, required, except, for, the, hydrolysis, of, sucrose, and, 90, of, the, nutrients, in, the, xylem, sap, can, be, utilised, some, phloem, sap, feeders, selectively, mix, phloem, and, xylem, sap, to, control, the, osmotic, potential, of, the, liquid, consumed, a, striking, adaptation, to, a, very, dilute, diet, is, found, in, many, hemipterans, a, filter, chamber, a, part, of, the, gut, looped, back, on, itself, as, a, countercurrent, exchanger, which, permits, nutrients, to, be, separated, from, excess, water, the, residue, mostly, water, with, sugars, and, amino, acids, is, quickly, excreted, as, sticky, honey, dew, notably, from, aphids, but, also, from, other, auchenorrhycha, and, sternorrhyncha, some, sternorrhyncha, including, psyllids, and, some, aphids, are, gall, formers, these, sap, sucking, hemipterans, inject, fluids, containing, plant, hormones, into, the, plant, tissues, inducing, the, production, of, tissue, that, covers, to, protects, the, insect, and, also, act, as, sinks, for, nutrition, that, they, feed, on, the, hackleberry, gall, psyllid, for, example, causes, a, woody, gall, on, the, leaf, petioles, of, the, hackleberry, tree, it, infests, and, the, nymph, of, another, psyllid, produces, a, protective, lerp, out, of, hardened, honeydew, most, other, hemipterans, are, predatory, feeding, on, other, insects, or, even, small, vertebrates, this, is, true, of, many, aquatic, species, which, are, predatory, either, as, nymphs, or, adults, the, predatory, shield, bug, for, example, stabs, caterpillars, with, its, beak, and, sucks, out, the, body, fluids, the, saliva, of, predatory, heteropterans, contains, digestive, enzymes, such, as, proteinase, and, phospholipase, and, in, some, species, also, amylase, the, mouthparts, of, these, insects, are, adapted, for, predation, there, are, toothed, stylets, on, the, mandibles, able, to, cut, into, and, abrade, tissues, of, their, prey, there, are, further, stylets, on, the, maxillae, adapted, as, tubular, canals, to, inject, saliva, and, to, extract, the, pre, digested, and, liquified, contents, of, the, prey, a, few, hemipterans, are, haematophagic, ectoparasites, feeding, on, the, blood, of, larger, animals, these, include, bedbugs, and, the, triatomine, kissing, bugs, of, the, assassin, bug, family, reduviidae, which, can, transmit, the, dangerous, chagas, disease, the, first, known, hemipteran, to, feed, in, this, way, on, vertebrates, was, the, extinct, assassin, bug, triatoma, dominicana, found, fossilized, in, amber, and, dating, back, about, twenty, million, years, faecal, pellets, fossilised, beside, it, show, that, it, transmitted, a, disease, causing, trypanosoma, and, the, amber, included, hairs, of, the, likely, host, a, bat, some, species, of, ant, protect, and, farm, aphids, sternorrhyncha, and, other, sap, sucking, hemipterans, gathering, and, eating, the, honeydew, that, these, hemipterans, secrete, the, relationship, is, mutualistic, as, both, ant, and, aphid, benefit, ants, such, as, the, yellow, anthill, ant, lasius, flavus, breed, aphids, of, at, least, four, species, geoica, utricularia, tetraneura, ulmi, forda, marginata, and, forda, formicaria, taking, eggs, with, them, when, they, found, a, new, colony, in, return, these, aphids, are, obligately, associated, with, the, ant, breeding, mainly, or, wholly, asexually, inside, anthills, ants, may, also, protect, the, plant, bugs, from, their, natural, enemies, removing, the, eggs, of, predatory, beetles, and, preventing, access, by, parasitic, wasps, some, leafhoppers, auchenorrhyncha, are, similarly, milked, by, ants, in, the, corcovado, rain, forest, of, costa, rica, wasps, compete, with, ants, to, protect, and, milk, leafhoppers, the, leafhoppers, preferentially, give, more, honeydew, more, often, to, the, wasps, which, are, larger, and, may, offer, better, protection, hemiptera, form, prey, to, predators, including, vertebrates, such, as, birds, and, other, invertebrates, such, as, ladybirds, in, response, hemipterans, have, evolved, antipredator, adaptations, ranatra, may, feign, death, thanatosis, others, such, as, carpocoris, purpureipennis, secrete, toxic, fluids, to, ward, off, arthropod, predators, some, pentatomidae, such, as, dolycoris, are, able, to, direct, these, fluids, at, an, attacker, toxic, cardenolide, compounds, are, accumulated, by, the, heteropteran, oncopeltus, fasciatus, when, it, consumes, milkweeds, while, the, coreid, stinkbug, amorbus, rubiginosus, acquires, 2, hexenal, from, its, food, plant, eucalyptus, some, long, legged, bugs, mimic, twigs, rocking, to, and, fro, to, simulate, the, motion, of, a, plant, part, in, the, wind, the, nymph, of, the, masked, hunter, bug, camouflages, itself, with, sand, grains, using, its, hind, legs, and, tarsal, fan, to, form, a, double, layer, of, grains, coarser, on, the, outside, the, amazon, rain, forest, cicada, hemisciera, maculipennis, displays, bright, red, deimatic, flash, coloration, on, its, hindwings, when, threatened, the, sudden, contrast, helps, to, startle, predators, giving, the, cicada, time, to, escape, the, coloured, patch, on, the, hindwing, is, concealed, at, rest, by, an, olive, green, patch, of, the, same, size, on, the, forewing, enabling, the, insect, to, switch, rapidly, from, cryptic, to, deimatic, behaviour, some, hemipterans, such, as, firebugs, have, bold, aposematic, warning, coloration, often, red, and, black, which, appear, to, deter, passerine, birds, many, hemipterans, including, aphids, scale, insects, and, especially, the, planthoppers, secrete, wax, to, protect, themselves, from, threats, such, as, fungi, parasitoidal, insects, and, predators, as, well, as, abiotic, factors, like, desiccation, hard, waxy, coverings, are, especially, important, in, the, sedentary, sternorrhyncha, such, as, scale, insects, which, have, no, means, of, escaping, from, predators, other, sternorrhyncha, evade, detection, and, attack, by, creating, and, living, inside, plant, galls, nymphal, cicadoidea, and, cercopoidea, have, glands, attached, to, the, malpighian, tubules, in, their, proximal, segment, that, produce, mucopolysaccharides, which, form, the, froth, around, spittlebugs, offering, a, measure, of, protection, parental, care, is, found, in, many, species, of, hemiptera, especially, in, members, of, the, membracidae, and, numerous, heteroptera, in, many, species, of, shield, bug, females, stand, guard, over, their, egg, clusters, to, protect, them, from, egg, parasitoids, and, predators, in, the, aquatic, belostomatidae, females, lay, their, eggs, on, the, back, of, the, male, which, guards, the, eggs, protection, provided, by, ants, is, common, in, the, auchenorrhyncha, although, many, species, of, hemiptera, are, significant, pests, of, crops, and, garden, plants, including, many, species, of, aphid, and, scale, insects, other, species, are, harmless, the, damage, done, is, often, not, so, much, the, deprivation, of, the, plant, of, its, sap, but, the, fact, that, they, transmit, serious, viral, diseases, between, plants, they, often, produce, copious, amounts, of, honeydew, which, encourages, the, growth, of, sooty, mould, significant, pests, include, the, cottony, cushion, scale, a, pest, of, citrus, fruit, trees, the, green, peach, aphid, and, other, aphids, which, attack, crops, worldwide, and, transmit, diseases, and, jumping, plant, lice, which, are, often, host, plant, specific, and, transmit, diseases, members, of, the, families, reduviidae, phymatidae, and, nabidae, are, obligate, predators, some, predatory, species, are, used, in, biological, pest, control, these, include, various, nabids, and, even, some, members, of, families, that, are, primarily, phytophagous, such, as, the, genus, geocoris, in, the, family, lygaeidae, other, hemipterans, are, omnivores, alternating, between, a, plant, based, and, an, animal, based, diet, for, example, dicyphus, hesperus, is, used, to, control, whitefly, on, tomatoes, but, also, sucks, sap, and, if, deprived, of, plant, tissues, will, die, even, if, in, the, presence, of, whiteflies, the, spined, soldier, bug, podisus, maculiventris, sucks, body, fluids, from, several, pests, including, the, larvae, of, the, colorado, beetle, and, the, mexican, bean, beetle, other, hemipterans, have, positive, uses, for, humans, such, as, in, the, production, of, the, dyestuff, carmine, cochineal, the, fda, has, created, guidelines, for, how, to, declare, when, it, has, been, added, to, a, product, the, scale, insect, dactylopius, coccus, produces, the, brilliant, red, coloured, carminic, acid, to, deter, predators, up, to, 100, 000, scale, insects, need, to, be, collected, and, processed, to, make, a, kilogram, 2,
