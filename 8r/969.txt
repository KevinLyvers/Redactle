see, text, taraxacum, t, r, k, s, k, m, is, a, large, genus, of, flowering, plants, in, the, family, asteraceae, which, consists, of, species, commonly, known, as, dandelions, the, scientific, and, hobby, study, of, the, genus, is, known, as, taraxacology, the, genus, is, native, to, eurasia, but, the, two, most, commonplace, species, worldwide, t, officinale, the, common, dandelion, and, t, erythrospermum, the, red, seeded, dandelion, were, introduced, from, europe, into, north, america, where, they, are, an, invasive, species, dandelions, thrive, in, temperate, regions, and, can, be, found, in, yards, gardens, sides, of, roads, among, crops, and, in, many, other, habitats, both, species, are, edible, in, their, entirety, and, have, a, long, history, of, consumption, the, common, name, dandelion, d, n, d, l, a, n, dan, d, ly, n, from, french, dent, de, lion, lion, s, tooth, referring, to, the, jagged, leaves, is, also, given, to, specific, members, of, the, genus, like, other, members, of, the, family, asteraceae, they, have, very, small, flowers, collected, together, into, a, composite, flower, head, each, single, flower, in, a, head, is, called, a, floret, in, part, due, to, their, abundance, along, with, being, a, generalist, species, dandelions, are, one, of, the, most, vital, early, spring, nectar, sources, for, a, wide, host, of, pollinators, many, taraxacum, species, produce, seeds, asexually, by, apomixis, where, the, seeds, are, produced, without, pollination, resulting, in, offspring, that, are, genetically, identical, to, the, parent, plant, in, general, the, leaves, are, 50, 250, mm, 2, 10, in, long, or, longer, simple, lobed, to, pinnatisect, and, form, a, basal, rosette, above, the, central, taproot, the, flower, heads, are, yellow, to, orange, coloured, and, are, open, in, the, daytime, but, closed, at, night, the, heads, are, borne, singly, on, a, hollow, stem, scape, that, is, usually, leafless, and, rises, 10, 100, mm, 3, 8, 3, 7, 8, in, or, more, above, the, leaves, stems, and, leaves, exude, a, white, milky, latex, when, broken, a, rosette, may, produce, several, flowering, stems, at, a, time, the, flower, heads, are, 20, 50, mm, 3, 4, 2, in, in, diameter, and, consist, entirely, of, ray, florets, the, flower, heads, mature, into, spherical, seed, heads, sometimes, called, blowballs, or, clocks, in, both, british, and, american, english, containing, many, single, seeded, fruits, called, cypselae, similar, to, achenes, each, cypsela, is, attached, to, a, pappus, of, fine, hair, like, material, which, enables, anemochorous, wind, aided, dispersal, over, long, distances, the, flower, head, is, surrounded, by, bracts, sometimes, mistakenly, called, sepals, in, two, series, the, inner, bracts, are, erect, until, the, seeds, mature, then, flex, downward, to, allow, the, seeds, to, disperse, the, outer, bracts, are, often, reflexed, downward, but, remain, appressed, in, plants, of, the, sections, palustria, and, spectabilia, between, the, pappus, and, the, achene, is, a, stalk, called, a, beak, which, elongates, as, the, fruit, matures, the, beak, breaks, off, from, the, achene, quite, easily, separating, the, seed, from, the, parachute, the, species, of, taraxacum, are, tap, rooted, perennial, herbaceous, plants, native, to, temperate, areas, of, the, northern, hemisphere, the, genus, contains, many, species, which, usually, or, in, the, case, of, triploids, obligately, reproduce, by, apomixis, resulting, in, many, local, populations, and, endemism, in, the, british, isles, alone, 234, microspecies, i, e, morphologically, distinct, clonal, populations, are, recognised, in, nine, loosely, defined, sections, of, which, 40, are, probably, endemic, a, number, of, species, of, taraxacum, are, seed, dispersed, ruderals, that, rapidly, colonize, disturbed, soil, especially, the, common, dandelion, t, officinale, which, has, been, introduced, over, much, of, the, temperate, world, after, flowering, is, finished, the, dandelion, flower, head, dries, out, for, a, day, or, two, the, dried, petals, and, stamens, drop, off, the, bracts, reflex, curve, backwards, and, the, parachute, ball, opens, into, a, full, sphere, when, development, is, complete, the, mature, seeds, are, attached, to, white, fluffy, parachutes, which, easily, detach, from, the, seedhead, and, glide, by, wind, dispersing, the, seeds, are, able, to, cover, large, distances, when, dispersed, due, to, the, unique, morphology, of, the, pappus, which, works, to, create, a, unique, type, of, vortex, ring, that, stays, attached, to, the, seed, rather, than, being, sent, downstream, in, addition, to, the, creation, of, this, vortex, ring, the, pappus, can, adjust, its, morphology, depending, on, the, moisture, in, the, air, this, allows, the, plume, of, seeds, to, close, up, and, reduce, the, chance, to, separate, from, the, stem, waiting, for, optimal, conditions, that, will, maximize, dispersal, and, germination, many, similar, plants, in, the, family, asteraceae, with, yellow, flowers, are, sometimes, known, as, false, dandelions, dandelion, flowers, are, very, similar, to, those, of, cat, s, ears, hypochaeris, both, plants, carry, similar, flowers, which, form, into, windborne, seeds, however, dandelion, flowers, are, borne, singly, on, unbranched, hairless, and, leafless, hollow, stems, while, cat, s, ear, flowering, stems, are, branched, solid, and, carry, bracts, both, plants, have, a, basal, rosette, of, leaves, and, a, central, taproot, however, the, leaves, of, dandelions, are, smooth, or, glabrous, whereas, those, of, cat, s, ears, are, coarsely, hairy, 740, early, flowering, dandelions, may, be, distinguished, from, coltsfoot, tussilago, farfara, by, their, basal, rosette, of, leaves, their, lack, of, disc, florets, and, the, absence, of, scales, on, the, flowering, stem, other, plants, with, superficially, similar, flowers, include, hawkweeds, hieracium, and, hawksbeards, crepis, these, are, readily, distinguished, by, branched, flowering, stems, which, are, usually, hairy, and, bear, leaves, 740, the, genus, is, taxonomically, complex, due, to, the, presence, of, apomixis, any, morphologically, distinct, clonal, population, would, deserve, its, own, microspecies, phylogenetic, approaches, are, also, complicated, by, the, accelerated, mutation, in, apomixic, lines, and, repeated, ancient, hybridization, events, in, the, genus, as, of, 1970, the, group, is, divided, into, about, 34, macrospecies, or, sections, and, about, 2000, microspecies, some, botanists, take, a, much, narrower, view, and, only, accept, a, total, of, about, 60, macro, species, by, 2015, the, number, has, been, revised, to, include, 60, sections, and, about, 2800, microspecies, 30, of, these, sections, are, known, to, reproduce, sexually, about, 235, apomictic, and, polyploid, microspecies, have, been, recorded, in, great, britain, and, ireland, alone, botanists, specialising, in, the, genus, taraxacum, are, sometimes, called, taraxacologists, for, example, gunnar, marklund, johannes, leendert, van, soest, or, a, j, richards, dandelions, are, thought, to, have, evolved, about, 30, million, years, ago, in, eurasia, fossil, seeds, of, taraxacum, tanaiticum, have, been, recorded, from, the, pliocene, of, southern, belarus, dandelions, have, been, used, by, humans, for, food, and, as, an, herb, for, much, of, recorded, history, they, were, well, known, to, ancient, egyptians, greeks, and, romans, and, are, recorded, to, have, been, used, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, for, over, a, thousand, years, the, plant, was, used, as, food, and, medicine, by, native, americans, dandelions, were, probably, brought, to, north, america, on, the, mayflower, for, their, supposed, medicinal, benefits, the, latin, name, taraxacum, originates, in, medieval, arabic, writings, on, pharmacy, the, scientist, al, razi, around, 900, ce, wrote, the, tarashaquq, is, like, chicory, the, scientist, and, philosopher, ibn, s, n, around, 1000, ce, wrote, a, book, chapter, on, taraxacum, gerard, of, cremona, in, translating, arabic, to, latin, around, 1170, spelled, it, tarasacon, the, english, name, dandelion, is, a, corruption, of, the, french, dent, de, lion, meaning, lion, s, tooth, referring, to, the, coarsely, toothed, leaves, the, plant, is, also, known, as, blowball, cankerwort, doon, head, clock, witch, s, gowan, milk, witch, lion, s, tooth, yellow, gowan, irish, daisy, monks, head, priest, s, crown, and, puff, ball, other, common, names, include, faceclock, pee, a, bed, wet, a, bed, swine, s, snout, white, endive, and, wild, endive, the, english, folk, name, piss, a, bed, and, indeed, the, equivalent, contemporary, french, pissenlit, refers, to, the, strong, diuretic, effect, of, the, plant, s, roots, in, various, northeastern, italian, dialects, the, plant, is, known, as, pisacan, dog, pisses, because, they, are, found, at, the, side, of, pavements, in, swedish, it, is, called, maskros, worm, rose, after, the, nymphs, of, small, insects, thrips, larvae, usually, present, in, the, flowers, raw, dandelion, greens, contain, high, amounts, of, vitamins, a, c, and, k, and, are, moderate, sources, of, calcium, potassium, iron, and, manganese, raw, dandelion, greens, are, 86, water, 9, carbohydrates, 3, protein, and, 1, fat, a, 100, gram, 3, 1, 2, oz, reference, amount, supplies, 45, calories, the, raw, flowers, contain, diverse, phytochemicals, including, polyphenols, such, as, flavonoids, apigenin, isoquercitrin, a, quercetin, like, compound, and, caffeic, acid, as, well, as, terpenoids, triterpenes, and, sesquiterpenes, the, roots, contain, a, substantial, amount, of, the, prebiotic, fiber, inulin, dandelion, greens, contain, lutein, taraxalisin, a, serine, proteinase, is, found, in, the, latex, of, dandelion, roots, maximal, activity, of, the, proteinase, in, the, roots, is, attained, in, april, at, the, beginning, of, plant, development, after, the, winter, period, each, dandelion, seed, has, a, mass, weight, of, 500, micrograms, or, 0, 0005g, 1, 125, of, a, grain, the, entire, plant, including, the, leaves, stems, flowers, and, roots, is, edible, and, nutritious, with, nutrients, such, as, vitamins, a, and, k, as, well, as, calcium, and, iron, dandelions, are, found, on, six, continents, and, have, been, gathered, for, food, since, prehistory, but, the, varieties, commercially, cultivated, for, consumption, are, mainly, native, to, eurasia, and, north, america, a, perennial, plant, its, leaves, grow, back, if, the, taproot, is, left, intact, to, make, leaves, more, palatable, they, are, often, blanched, to, remove, bitterness, or, sauteed, in, the, same, way, as, spinach, dandelion, greens, have, been, a, part, of, traditional, kashmiri, cuisine, lebanese, cuisine, spanish, cuisine, italian, cuisine, albanian, cuisine, slovenian, sephardic, jewish, chinese, greek, cuisine, and, korean, cuisines, in, crete, the, leaves, of, a, variety, called, mari, mariaki, or, koproradiko, are, eaten, by, locals, either, raw, or, boiled, in, salads, t, megalorhizon, a, species, endemic, to, crete, is, eaten, in, the, same, way, it, is, found, only, at, high, altitudes, 1, 000, 1, 600, metres, 3, 300, 5, 200, ft, and, in, fallow, sites, and, is, called, pentaramia, or, agrioradiko, the, flower, petals, along, with, other, ingredients, usually, including, citrus, are, used, to, make, dandelion, wine, its, ground, roasted, roots, can, be, used, as, a, caffeine, free, coffee, alternative, dandelion, was, also, commonly, used, to, make, the, traditional, british, soft, drink, dandelion, and, burdock, and, is, one, of, the, ingredients, of, root, beer, dandelions, were, once, considered, delicacies, by, the, victorian, gentry, who, used, them, mostly, in, salads, and, sandwiches, the, yellow, flowers, can, be, dried, and, ground, into, a, yellow, pigmented, powder, and, used, as, a, dye, dandelions, may, cause, allergic, reactions, for, sensitive, individuals, when, consumed, or, coming, into, contact, with, skin, but, the, risk, is, mild, latex, containing, sesquiterpene, lactones, are, present, in, high, concentrations, in, the, main, root, and, stems, of, the, common, dandelion, however, only, a, few, researchers, have, mentioned, the, possible, risk, of, mild, allergic, contact, dermatitis, for, people, with, lactone, hypersensitivity, dandelion, has, been, used, in, traditional, medicine, in, europe, north, america, and, china, it, s, possible, that, the, dandelion, has, physiological, effects, in, type, 2, diabetes, dandelion, components, play, a, significant, role, in, the, control, of, lipid, metabolism, and, adipogenesis, which, means, dandelion, can, potentially, be, used, to, treat, obesity, dandelion, leaves, and, dandelion, root, extracts, have, been, shown, to, possibly, decrease, growth, of, cancer, cells, dandelions, do, not, depend, on, wildlife, for, distribution, or, pollination, however, much, of, wildlife, benefits, from, the, abundance, of, the, plant, rabbits, wild, turkeys, white, tailed, deer, eastern, chipmunks, bobwhite, quail, and, many, species, of, birds, will, consume, the, seeds, and, foliage, additionally, many, insects, will, collect, nectar, from, the, flower, especially, in, early, spring, when, there, are, very, few, other, flowers, in, bloom, taraxacum, seeds, are, an, important, food, source, for, certain, birds, linnets, linaria, spp, szabo, studied, nectar, secretion, in, a, dandelion, patch, over, two, years, 59, 2, and, 8, 9, flowers, per, square, metre, 5, 50, and, 0, 83, sq, ft, in, 1981, and, 1982, he, measured, average, nectar, volume, at, 7, 4, l, flower, in, 1981, and, 3, 7, l, flower, in, 1982, the, flowers, tended, to, open, in, the, morning, and, close, in, the, afternoon, with, the, concentrations, significantly, higher, on, the, second, day, dandelions, are, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, some, species, of, lepidoptera, butterflies, and, moths, dandelions, can, cause, significant, economic, damage, as, an, invasive, species, and, infestation, of, other, crops, worldwide, in, some, jurisdictions, the, species, t, officinale, is, listed, as, a, noxious, weed, it, can, also, be, considered, invasive, in, protected, areas, such, as, national, parks, for, example, denali, national, park, and, preserve, in, alaska, lists, taraxacum, officinale, as, the, most, common, invasive, species, in, the, park, and, hosts, an, annual, dandelion, demolition, event, where, volunteers, are, trained, to, remove, the, plant, from, the, park, s, roadsides, with, a, wide, range, of, uses, the, dandelion, is, cultivated, in, small, gardens, to, massive, farms, it, is, kept, as, a, companion, plant, its, taproot, brings, up, nutrients, for, shallow, rooting, plants, it, is, also, known, to, attract, pollinating, insects, and, release, ethylene, gas, which, helps, fruit, to, ripen, it, has, been, a, western, tradition, for, someone, to, blow, out, a, dandelion, seedhead, and, think, of, a, wish, they, want, to, come, true, five, dandelion, flowers, are, the, emblem, of, white, sulphur, springs, west, virginia, the, citizens, celebrate, spring, with, an, annual, dandelion, festival, the, dandelion, is, the, official, flower, of, the, university, of, rochester, in, new, york, state, and, dandelion, yellow, is, one, of, the, school, s, official, colors, the, dandelion, yellow, is, an, official, university, of, rochester, song, the, ability, of, dandelion, seeds, to, travel, as, far, as, a, kilometer, in, dry, windy, and, warm, conditions, has, been, an, inspiration, for, designing, light, weight, passive, drones, in, 2018, researchers, discovered, that, dandelion, seeds, have, a, separated, vortex, ring, this, work, provided, evidence, that, dandelion, seeds, have, fluid, behavior, around, fluid, immersed, bodies, that, may, help, understand, locomotion, weight, reduction, and, particle, retention, in, biological, and, man, made, structures, in, 2022, researchers, at, the, university, of, washington, demonstrated, battery, free, wireless, sensors, and, computers, that, mimic, dandelion, seeds, and, can, float, in, the, wind, and, disperse, across, a, large, area, dandelions, secrete, latex, when, the, tissues, are, cut, or, broken, yet, in, the, wild, type, the, latex, content, is, low, and, varies, greatly, taraxacum, kok, saghyz, the, russian, dandelion, is, a, species, that, produced, industrially, useful, amounts, during, ww2, using, modern, cultivation, methods, and, optimization, techniques, scientists, in, the, fraunhofer, institute, for, molecular, biology, and, applied, ecology, ime, in, germany, developed, a, cultivar, of, the, russian, dandelion, that, is, suitable, for, current, commercial, production, of, natural, rubber, the, latex, produced, exhibits, the, same, quality, as, the, natural, rubber, from, rubber, trees, in, collaboration, with, continental, ag, ime, is, building, a, pilot, facility, as, of, may, 2014, the, first, prototype, test, tires, made, with, blends, from, dandelion, rubber, are, scheduled, for, testing, on, public, roads, over, the, next, few, years, in, december, 2017, linglong, group, co, ltd, a, chinese, company, invested, 450, million, into, making, commercially, viable, rubber, from, dandelions
