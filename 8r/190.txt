oxytocin, is, a, peptide, hormone, and, neuropeptide, normally, produced, in, the, hypothalamus, and, released, by, the, posterior, pituitary, present, in, animals, since, early, stages, of, evolution, in, humans, it, plays, roles, in, behavior, that, include, social, bonding, love, reproduction, childbirth, and, the, period, after, childbirth, oxytocin, is, released, into, the, bloodstream, as, a, hormone, in, response, to, sexual, activity, and, during, childbirth, it, is, also, available, in, pharmaceutical, form, in, either, form, oxytocin, stimulates, uterine, contractions, to, speed, up, the, process, of, childbirth, in, its, natural, form, it, also, plays, a, role, in, maternal, bonding, and, milk, production, production, and, secretion, of, oxytocin, is, controlled, by, a, positive, feedback, mechanism, where, its, initial, release, stimulates, production, and, release, of, further, oxytocin, for, example, when, oxytocin, is, released, during, a, contraction, of, the, uterus, at, the, start, of, childbirth, this, stimulates, production, and, release, of, more, oxytocin, and, an, increase, in, the, intensity, and, frequency, of, contractions, this, process, compounds, in, intensity, and, frequency, and, continues, until, the, triggering, activity, ceases, a, similar, process, takes, place, during, lactation, and, during, sexual, activity, oxytocin, is, derived, by, enzymatic, splitting, from, the, peptide, precursor, encoded, by, the, human, oxt, gene, the, deduced, structure, of, the, active, nonapeptide, is, the, term, oxytocin, derives, from, the, greek, kut, kos, based, on, ox, s, meaning, sharp, or, swift, and, t, kos, meaning, childbirth, the, adjective, form, is, oxytocic, which, refers, to, medicines, which, stimulate, uterine, contractions, to, speed, up, the, process, of, childbirth, colloquially, it, has, been, referred, to, as, the, cuddle, hormone, or, the, moral, molecule, which, have, been, considered, misnomers, the, uterine, contracting, properties, of, the, principle, that, would, later, be, named, oxytocin, were, discovered, by, british, pharmacologist, henry, hallett, dale, in, 1906, and, its, milk, ejection, property, was, described, by, ott, and, scott, in, 1910, and, by, schafer, and, mackenzie, in, 1911, in, 1909, the, first, clinical, use, of, oxytocin, was, performed, by, william, blair, bell, to, induce, childbirth, in, patients, with, complications, by, the, 1920s, oxytocin, and, vasopressin, had, been, isolated, from, pituitary, tissue, and, given, their, current, names, oxytocin, s, molecular, structure, was, determined, in, 1952, in, the, early, 1950s, american, biochemist, vincent, du, vigneaud, found, that, oxytocin, is, made, up, of, nine, amino, acids, and, he, identified, its, amino, acid, sequence, the, first, polypeptide, hormone, to, be, sequenced, in, 1953, du, vigneaud, carried, out, the, synthesis, of, oxytocin, the, first, polypeptide, hormone, to, be, synthesized, du, vigneaud, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, 1955, for, his, work, further, work, on, different, synthetic, routes, for, oxytocin, as, well, as, the, preparation, of, analogues, of, the, hormone, e, g, 4, deamido, oxytocin, was, performed, in, the, following, decade, by, iphigenia, photaki, 5020, 18429, ensg00000101405, ensmusg00000027301, p01178, p35454, nm, 000915, nm, 011025, np, 000906, np, 035155, estrogen, has, been, found, to, increase, the, secretion, of, oxytocin, and, to, increase, the, expression, of, its, receptor, the, oxytocin, receptor, in, the, brain, in, women, a, single, dose, of, estradiol, has, been, found, to, be, sufficient, to, increase, circulating, oxytocin, concentrations, oxytocin, and, vasopressin, are, the, only, known, hormones, released, by, the, human, posterior, pituitary, gland, to, act, at, a, distance, however, oxytocin, neurons, make, other, peptides, including, corticotropin, releasing, hormone, crh, and, dynorphin, for, example, that, act, locally, the, magnocellular, neurons, that, make, oxytocin, are, adjacent, to, magnocellular, neurons, that, make, vasopressin, and, are, similar, in, many, respects, the, oxytocin, peptide, is, synthesized, as, an, inactive, precursor, protein, from, the, oxt, gene, this, precursor, protein, also, includes, the, oxytocin, carrier, protein, neurophysin, i, the, inactive, precursor, protein, is, progressively, hydrolyzed, into, smaller, fragments, one, of, which, is, neurophysin, i, via, a, series, of, enzymes, the, last, hydrolysis, that, releases, the, active, oxytocin, nonapeptide, is, catalyzed, by, peptidylglycine, alpha, amidating, monooxygenase, pam, the, activity, of, the, pam, enzyme, system, is, dependent, upon, vitamin, c, ascorbate, which, is, a, necessary, vitamin, cofactor, by, chance, sodium, ascorbate, by, itself, was, found, to, stimulate, the, production, of, oxytocin, from, ovarian, tissue, over, a, range, of, concentrations, in, a, dose, dependent, manner, many, of, the, same, tissues, e, g, ovaries, testes, eyes, adrenals, placenta, thymus, pancreas, where, pam, and, oxytocin, by, default, is, found, are, also, known, to, store, higher, concentrations, of, vitamin, c, oxytocin, is, known, to, be, metabolized, by, the, oxytocinase, leucyl, cystinyl, aminopeptidase, other, oxytocinases, are, also, known, to, exist, amastatin, bestatin, ubenimex, leupeptin, and, puromycin, have, been, found, to, inhibit, the, enzymatic, degradation, of, oxytocin, though, they, also, inhibit, the, degradation, of, various, other, peptides, such, as, vasopressin, met, enkephalin, and, dynorphin, a, in, the, hypothalamus, oxytocin, is, made, in, magnocellular, neurosecretory, cells, of, the, supraoptic, and, paraventricular, nuclei, and, is, stored, in, herring, bodies, at, the, axon, terminals, in, the, posterior, pituitary, it, is, then, released, into, the, blood, from, the, posterior, lobe, neurohypophysis, of, the, pituitary, gland, these, axons, likely, but, dendrites, have, not, been, ruled, out, have, collaterals, that, innervate, neurons, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, a, brain, structure, where, oxytocin, receptors, are, expressed, the, endocrine, effects, of, hormonal, oxytocin, and, the, cognitive, or, behavioral, effects, of, oxytocin, neuropeptides, are, thought, to, be, coordinated, through, its, common, release, through, these, collaterals, oxytocin, is, also, produced, by, some, neurons, in, the, paraventricular, nucleus, that, project, to, other, parts, of, the, brain, and, to, the, spinal, cord, depending, on, the, species, oxytocin, receptor, expressing, cells, are, located, in, other, areas, including, the, amygdala, and, bed, nucleus, of, the, stria, terminalis, in, the, pituitary, gland, oxytocin, is, packaged, in, large, dense, core, vesicles, where, it, is, bound, to, neurophysin, i, as, shown, in, the, inset, of, the, figure, neurophysin, is, a, large, peptide, fragment, of, the, larger, precursor, protein, molecule, from, which, oxytocin, is, derived, by, enzymatic, cleavage, secretion, of, oxytocin, from, the, neurosecretory, nerve, endings, is, regulated, by, the, electrical, activity, of, the, oxytocin, cells, in, the, hypothalamus, these, cells, generate, action, potentials, that, propagate, down, axons, to, the, nerve, endings, in, the, pituitary, the, endings, contain, large, numbers, of, oxytocin, containing, vesicles, which, are, released, by, exocytosis, when, the, nerve, terminals, are, depolarised, endogenous, oxytocin, concentrations, in, the, brain, have, been, found, to, be, as, much, as, 1000, fold, higher, than, peripheral, levels, outside, the, brain, oxytocin, containing, cells, have, been, identified, in, several, diverse, tissues, including, in, females, in, the, corpus, luteum, and, the, placenta, in, males, in, the, testicles, interstitial, cells, of, leydig, and, in, both, sexes, in, the, retina, the, adrenal, medulla, the, thymus, and, the, pancreas, the, finding, of, significant, amounts, of, this, classically, neurohypophysial, hormone, outside, the, central, nervous, system, raises, many, questions, regarding, its, possible, importance, in, these, diverse, tissues, the, leydig, cells, in, some, species, have, been, shown, to, possess, the, biosynthetic, machinery, to, manufacture, testicular, oxytocin, de, novo, to, be, specific, in, rats, which, can, synthesize, vitamin, c, endogenously, and, in, guinea, pigs, which, like, humans, require, an, exogenous, source, of, vitamin, c, ascorbate, in, their, diets, oxytocin, is, synthesized, by, corpora, lutea, of, several, species, including, ruminants, and, primates, along, with, estrogen, it, is, involved, in, inducing, the, endometrial, synthesis, of, prostaglandin, f, 2, to, cause, regression, of, the, corpus, luteum, virtually, all, vertebrates, have, an, oxytocin, like, nonapeptide, hormone, that, supports, reproductive, functions, and, a, vasopressin, like, nonapeptide, hormone, involved, in, water, regulation, the, two, genes, are, usually, located, close, to, each, other, less, than, 15, 000, bases, apart, on, the, same, chromosome, and, are, transcribed, in, opposite, directions, however, in, fugu, the, homologs, are, further, apart, and, transcribed, in, the, same, direction, the, two, genes, are, believed, to, result, from, a, gene, duplication, event, the, ancestral, gene, is, estimated, to, be, about, 500, million, years, old, and, is, found, in, cyclostomata, modern, members, of, the, agnatha, a, 2023, study, found, that, zebrafish, utilize, oxytocin, in, reaction, to, the, fear, of, other, fish, it, found, that, zebrafish, that, have, had, oxytocin, production, removed, by, gene, editing, cannot, respond, to, the, fear, of, other, fish, when, oxytocin, is, injected, back, into, the, fish, they, react, again, in, a, way, that, suggests, they, may, have, empathy, in, regards, to, this, emotion, furthermore, because, the, same, regions, of, the, brain, are, involved, as, in, mammals, the, study, suggests, oxytocin, based, empathy, may, have, evolved, from, a, common, ancestor, many, millions, of, years, ago, oxytocin, has, peripheral, hormonal, actions, and, also, has, actions, in, the, brain, its, actions, are, mediated, by, specific, oxytocin, receptors, the, oxytocin, receptor, is, a, g, protein, coupled, receptor, ot, r, which, requires, magnesium, and, cholesterol, and, is, expressed, in, myometrial, cells, it, belongs, to, the, rhodopsin, type, class, i, group, of, g, protein, coupled, receptors, studies, have, looked, at, oxytocin, s, role, in, various, behaviors, including, orgasm, social, recognition, pair, bonding, anxiety, in, group, bias, situational, lack, of, honesty, autism, and, maternal, behaviors, oxytocin, is, believed, to, have, a, significant, role, in, social, learning, there, are, indicators, that, oxytocin, may, help, to, decrease, noise, in, the, brain, s, auditory, system, increase, perception, of, social, cues, and, support, more, targeted, social, behavior, it, may, also, enhance, reward, responses, however, its, effects, may, be, influenced, by, context, such, as, the, presence, of, familiar, or, unfamiliar, individuals, the, peripheral, actions, of, oxytocin, mainly, reflect, secretion, from, the, pituitary, gland, the, behavioral, effects, of, oxytocin, are, thought, to, reflect, release, from, centrally, projecting, oxytocin, neurons, different, from, those, that, project, to, the, pituitary, gland, or, that, are, collaterals, from, them, oxytocin, receptors, are, expressed, by, neurons, in, many, parts, of, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, including, the, amygdala, ventromedial, hypothalamus, septum, nucleus, accumbens, and, brainstem, although, the, distribution, differs, markedly, between, species, furthermore, the, distribution, of, these, receptors, changes, during, development, and, has, been, observed, to, change, after, parturition, in, the, montane, vole, in, the, prairie, vole, oxytocin, released, into, the, brain, of, the, female, during, sexual, activity, is, important, for, forming, a, pair, bond, with, her, sexual, partner, vasopressin, appears, to, have, a, similar, effect, in, males, oxytocin, has, a, role, in, social, behaviors, in, many, species, so, it, likely, also, does, in, humans, in, a, 2003, study, both, humans, and, dog, oxytocin, levels, in, the, blood, rose, after, a, five, to, 24, minute, petting, session, this, possibly, plays, a, role, in, the, emotional, bonding, between, humans, and, dogs, oxytocin, is, not, only, correlated, with, the, preferences, of, individuals, to, associate, with, members, of, their, own, group, but, it, is, also, evident, during, conflicts, between, members, of, different, groups, during, conflict, individuals, receiving, nasally, administered, oxytocin, demonstrate, more, frequent, defense, motivated, responses, toward, in, group, members, than, out, group, members, further, oxytocin, was, correlated, with, participant, desire, to, protect, vulnerable, in, group, members, despite, that, individual, s, attachment, to, the, conflict, similarly, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, when, oxytocin, is, administered, individuals, alter, their, subjective, preferences, in, order, to, align, with, in, group, ideals, over, out, group, ideals, these, studies, demonstrate, that, oxytocin, is, associated, with, intergroup, dynamics, further, oxytocin, influences, the, responses, of, individuals, in, a, particular, group, to, those, of, another, group, the, in, group, bias, is, evident, in, smaller, groups, however, it, can, also, be, extended, to, groups, as, large, as, one, s, entire, country, leading, toward, a, tendency, of, strong, national, zeal, a, study, done, in, the, netherlands, showed, that, oxytocin, increased, the, in, group, favoritism, of, their, nation, while, decreasing, acceptance, of, members, of, other, ethnicities, and, foreigners, people, also, show, more, affection, for, their, country, s, flag, while, remaining, indifferent, to, other, cultural, objects, when, exposed, to, oxytocin, it, has, thus, been, hypothesized, that, this, hormone, may, be, a, factor, in, xenophobic, tendencies, secondary, to, this, effect, thus, oxytocin, appears, to, affect, individuals, at, an, international, level, where, the, in, group, becomes, a, specific, home, country, and, the, out, group, grows, to, include, all, other, countries, oxytocin, is, typically, remembered, for, the, effect, it, has, on, prosocial, behaviors, such, as, its, role, in, facilitating, trust, and, attachment, between, individuals, however, oxytocin, has, a, more, complex, role, than, solely, enhancing, prosocial, behaviors, there, is, consensus, that, oxytocin, modulates, fear, and, anxiety, that, is, it, does, not, directly, elicit, fear, or, anxiety, two, dominant, theories, explain, the, role, of, oxytocin, in, fear, and, anxiety, one, theory, states, that, oxytocin, increases, approach, avoidance, to, certain, social, stimuli, and, the, second, theory, states, that, oxytocin, increases, the, salience, of, certain, social, stimuli, causing, animals, including, humans, to, pay, closer, attention, to, socially, relevant, stimuli, nasally, administered, oxytocin, has, been, reported, to, reduce, fear, possibly, by, inhibiting, the, amygdala, which, is, thought, to, be, responsible, for, fear, responses, indeed, studies, in, rodents, have, shown, oxytocin, can, efficiently, inhibit, fear, responses, by, activating, an, inhibitory, circuit, within, the, amygdala, some, researchers, have, argued, oxytocin, has, a, general, enhancing, effect, on, all, social, emotions, since, intranasal, administration, of, oxytocin, also, increases, envy, and, schadenfreude, individuals, who, receive, an, intranasal, dose, of, oxytocin, identify, facial, expressions, of, disgust, more, quickly, than, individuals, who, do, not, receive, oxytocin, facial, expressions, of, disgust, are, evolutionarily, linked, to, the, idea, of, contagion, thus, oxytocin, increases, the, salience, of, cues, that, imply, contamination, which, leads, to, a, faster, response, because, these, cues, are, especially, relevant, for, survival, in, another, study, after, administration, of, oxytocin, individuals, displayed, an, enhanced, ability, to, recognize, expressions, of, fear, compared, to, the, individuals, who, received, the, placebo, oxytocin, modulates, fear, responses, by, enhancing, the, maintenance, of, social, memories, rats, who, are, genetically, modified, to, have, a, surplus, of, oxytocin, receptors, display, a, greater, fear, response, to, a, previously, conditioned, stressor, oxytocin, enhances, the, aversive, social, memory, leading, the, rat, to, display, a, greater, fear, response, when, the, aversive, stimulus, is, encountered, again, oxytocin, produces, antidepressant, like, effects, in, animal, models, of, depression, and, a, deficit, of, it, may, be, involved, in, the, pathophysiology, of, depression, in, humans, the, antidepressant, like, effects, of, oxytocin, are, not, blocked, by, a, selective, antagonist, of, the, oxytocin, receptor, suggesting, that, these, effects, are, not, mediated, by, the, oxytocin, receptor, in, accordance, unlike, oxytocin, the, selective, non, peptide, oxytocin, receptor, agonist, way, 267, 464, does, not, produce, antidepressant, like, effects, at, least, in, the, tail, suspension, test, in, contrast, to, way, 267, 464, carbetocin, a, close, analogue, of, oxytocin, and, peptide, oxytocin, receptor, agonist, notably, does, produce, antidepressant, like, effects, in, animals, as, such, the, antidepressant, like, effects, of, oxytocin, may, be, mediated, by, modulation, of, a, different, target, perhaps, the, vasopressin, v, 1a, receptor, where, oxytocin, is, known, to, weakly, bind, as, an, agonist, oxytocin, mediates, the, antidepressant, like, effects, of, sexual, activity, a, drug, for, sexual, dysfunction, sildenafil, enhances, electrically, evoked, oxytocin, release, from, the, pituitary, gland, in, accordance, it, may, have, promise, as, an, antidepressant, it, has, been, shown, that, oxytocin, differentially, affects, males, and, females, females, who, are, administered, oxytocin, are, overall, faster, in, responding, to, socially, relevant, stimuli, than, males, who, received, oxytocin, additionally, after, the, administration, of, oxytocin, females, show, increased, amygdala, activity, in, response, to, threatening, scenes, however, males, do, not, show, increased, amygdala, activation, this, phenomenon, can, be, explained, by, looking, at, the, role, of, gonadal, hormones, specifically, estrogen, which, modulate, the, enhanced, threat, processing, seen, in, females, estrogen, has, been, shown, to, stimulate, the, release, of, oxytocin, from, the, hypothalamus, and, promote, receptor, binding, in, the, amygdala, it, has, also, been, shown, that, testosterone, directly, suppresses, oxytocin, in, mice, this, has, been, hypothesized, to, have, evolutionary, significance, with, oxytocin, suppressed, activities, such, as, hunting, and, attacking, invaders, would, be, less, mentally, difficult, as, oxytocin, is, strongly, associated, with, empathy, because, oxytocin, plays, a, role, in, social, bonding, maternal, behaviors, and, emotional, connections, between, people, it, is, also, informally, referred, to, as, the, love, hormone, this, term, is, not, a, medical, or, scientific, name, but, is, often, used, to, describe, oxytocin, s, effects, on, human, behavior, and, emotions, oxytocin, is, a, peptide, of, nine, amino, acids, a, nonapeptide, in, the, sequence, cysteine, tyrosine, isoleucine, glutamine, asparagine, cysteine, proline, leucine, glycine, amide, cys, tyr, ile, gln, asn, cys, pro, leu, gly, nh, 2, or, cyiqncplg, nh, 2, its, c, terminus, has, been, converted, to, a, primary, amide, and, a, disulfide, bridge, joins, the, cysteine, moieties, oxytocin, has, a, molecular, mass, of, 1007, da, and, one, international, unit, iu, of, oxytocin, is, the, equivalent, of, 1, 68, g, of, pure, peptide, while, the, structure, of, oxytocin, is, highly, conserved, in, placental, mammals, a, novel, structure, of, oxytocin, was, reported, in, 2011, in, marmosets, tamarins, and, other, new, world, primates, genomic, sequencing, of, the, gene, for, oxytocin, revealed, a, single, in, frame, mutation, thymine, for, cytosine, which, results, in, a, single, amino, acid, substitution, at, the, 8, position, proline, for, leucine, since, this, original, lee, et, al, paper, two, other, laboratories, have, confirmed, pro8, ot, and, documented, additional, oxytocin, structural, variants, in, this, primate, taxon, vargas, pinilla, et, al, sequenced, the, coding, regions, of, the, oxt, gene, in, other, genera, in, new, world, primates, and, identified, the, following, variants, in, addition, to, leu8, and, pro8, ot, ala8, ot, thr8, ot, and, val3, pro8, ot, ren, et, al, identified, a, variant, further, phe2, ot, in, howler, monkeys, recent, advances, in, analytical, instrumental, techniques, highlighted, the, importance, of, liquid, chromatography, lc, coupled, with, mass, spectrometry, ms, for, measuring, oxytocin, levels, in, various, samples, derived, from, biological, sources, most, of, these, studies, optimized, the, oxytocin, quantification, in, electrospray, ionization, esi, positive, mode, using, as, the, parent, ion, at, mass, to, charge, ratio, m, z, 1007, 4, and, the, fragment, ions, as, diagnostic, peaks, at, m, z, 991, 0, m, z, 723, 2, and, m, z, 504, 2, these, important, ion, selections, paved, the, way, for, the, development, of, current, methods, of, oxytocin, quantification, using, ms, instrumentation, the, structure, of, oxytocin, is, very, similar, to, that, of, vasopressin, both, are, nonapeptides, with, a, single, disulfide, bridge, differing, only, by, two, substitutions, in, the, amino, acid, sequence, differences, from, oxytocin, bolded, for, clarity, cys, tyr, phe, gln, asn, cys, pro, arg, gly, nh, 2, oxytocin, and, vasopressin, were, isolated, and, their, total, synthesis, reported, in, 1954, work, for, which, vincent, du, vigneaud, was, awarded, the, 1955, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, with, the, citation, for, his, work, on, biochemically, important, sulphur, compounds, especially, for, the, first, synthesis, of, a, polypeptide, hormone, oxytocin, and, vasopressin, are, the, only, known, hormones, released, by, the, human, posterior, pituitary, gland, to, act, at, a, distance, however, oxytocin, neurons, make, other, peptides, including, corticotropin, releasing, hormone, and, dynorphin, for, example, that, act, locally, the, magnocellular, neurosecretory, cells, that, make, oxytocin, are, adjacent, to, magnocellular, neurosecretory, cells, that, make, vasopressin, these, are, large, neuroendocrine, neurons, which, are, excitable, and, can, generate, action, potentials, oxytocin, is, the, name, of, the, fifth, song, on, billie, eilish, s, second, album, happier, than, ever, oxytocin, is, mentioned, in, the, first, lyric, of, post, malone, s, song, chemical, in, the, novel, the, fireman, by, joe, hill, the, hormone, plays, a, role, in, neutralizing, the, danger, posed, by, an, infectious, spore, that, causes, a, condition, known, as, dragonscale, if, the, spore, enters, an, oxytocin, rich, environment, it, will, enter, a, dormant, state, instead, of, causing, its, host, to, undergo, spontaneous, human, combustion, the, formula, for, oxytocin, is, displayed, as, written, on, the, fingers, of, nina, zilli, and, appears, in, the, opening, shot, of, her, video, for, sola
