traditional, phylogenetic, the, flatworms, flat, worms, platyhelminthes, or, platyhelminths, from, the, greek, platy, meaning, flat, and, root, helminth, meaning, worm, are, a, phylum, of, relatively, simple, bilaterian, unsegmented, soft, bodied, invertebrates, being, acoelomates, having, no, body, cavity, and, having, no, specialised, circulatory, and, respiratory, organs, they, are, restricted, to, having, flattened, shapes, that, allow, oxygen, and, nutrients, to, pass, through, their, bodies, by, diffusion, the, digestive, cavity, has, only, one, opening, for, both, ingestion, intake, of, nutrients, and, egestion, removal, of, undigested, wastes, as, a, result, the, food, can, not, be, processed, continuously, in, traditional, medicinal, texts, platyhelminthes, are, divided, into, turbellaria, which, are, mostly, non, parasitic, animals, such, as, planarians, and, three, entirely, parasitic, groups, cestoda, trematoda, and, monogenea, however, since, the, turbellarians, have, since, been, proven, not, to, be, monophyletic, this, classification, is, now, deprecated, free, living, flatworms, are, mostly, predators, and, live, in, water, or, in, shaded, humid, terrestrial, environments, such, as, leaf, litter, cestodes, tapeworms, and, trematodes, flukes, have, complex, life, cycles, with, mature, stages, that, live, as, parasites, in, the, digestive, systems, of, fish, or, land, vertebrates, and, intermediate, stages, that, infest, secondary, hosts, the, eggs, of, trematodes, are, excreted, from, their, main, hosts, whereas, adult, cestodes, generate, vast, numbers, of, hermaphroditic, segment, like, proglottids, that, detach, when, mature, are, excreted, and, then, release, eggs, unlike, the, other, parasitic, groups, the, monogeneans, are, external, parasites, infesting, aquatic, animals, and, their, larvae, metamorphose, into, the, adult, form, after, attaching, to, a, suitable, host, because, they, do, not, have, internal, body, cavities, platyhelminthes, were, regarded, as, a, primitive, stage, in, the, evolution, of, bilaterians, animals, with, bilateral, symmetry, and, hence, with, distinct, front, and, rear, ends, however, analyses, since, the, mid, 1980s, have, separated, out, one, subgroup, the, acoelomorpha, as, basal, bilaterians, closer, to, the, original, bilaterians, than, to, any, other, modern, groups, the, remaining, platyhelminthes, form, a, monophyletic, group, one, that, contains, all, and, only, descendants, of, a, common, ancestor, that, is, itself, a, member, of, the, group, the, redefined, platyhelminthes, is, part, of, the, lophotrochozoa, one, of, the, three, main, groups, of, more, complex, bilaterians, these, analyses, had, concluded, the, redefined, platyhelminthes, excluding, acoelomorpha, consists, of, two, monophyletic, subgroups, catenulida, and, rhabditophora, with, cestoda, trematoda, and, monogenea, forming, a, monophyletic, subgroup, within, one, branch, of, the, rhabditophora, hence, the, traditional, platyhelminth, subgroup, turbellaria, is, now, regarded, as, paraphyletic, since, it, excludes, the, wholly, parasitic, groups, although, these, are, descended, from, one, group, of, turbellarians, two, planarian, species, have, been, used, successfully, in, the, philippines, indonesia, hawaii, new, guinea, and, guam, to, control, populations, of, the, imported, giant, african, snail, achatina, fulica, which, was, displacing, native, snails, however, these, planarians, are, themselves, a, serious, threat, to, native, snails, and, should, not, be, used, for, biological, control, in, northwest, europe, there, are, concerns, about, the, spread, of, the, new, zealand, planarian, arthurdendyus, triangulatus, which, preys, on, earthworms, platyhelminthes, are, bilaterally, symmetrical, animals, their, left, and, right, sides, are, mirror, images, of, each, other, this, also, implies, they, have, distinct, top, and, bottom, surfaces, and, distinct, head, and, tail, ends, like, other, bilaterians, they, have, three, main, cell, layers, endoderm, mesoderm, and, ectoderm, while, the, radially, symmetrical, cnidarians, and, ctenophores, comb, jellies, have, only, two, cell, layers, beyond, that, they, are, defined, more, by, what, they, do, not, have, than, by, any, particular, series, of, specializations, unlike, most, other, bilaterians, platyhelminthes, have, no, internal, body, cavity, so, are, described, as, acoelomates, although, the, absence, of, a, coelom, also, occurs, in, other, bilaterians, gnathostomulids, gastrotrichs, xenacoelomorphs, cycliophorans, entoproctans, and, the, parastic, mesozoans, they, also, lack, specialized, circulatory, and, respiratory, organs, both, of, these, facts, are, defining, features, when, classifying, a, flatworm, s, anatomy, their, bodies, are, soft, and, unsegmented, the, lack, of, circulatory, and, respiratory, organs, limits, platyhelminths, to, sizes, and, shapes, that, enable, oxygen, to, reach, and, carbon, dioxide, to, leave, all, parts, of, their, bodies, by, simple, diffusion, hence, many, are, microscopic, and, the, large, species, have, flat, ribbon, like, or, leaf, like, shapes, because, there, is, no, circulatory, system, which, can, transport, nutrients, around, the, guts, of, large, species, have, many, branches, allowing, the, nutrients, to, diffuse, to, all, parts, of, the, body, respiration, through, the, whole, surface, of, the, body, makes, them, vulnerable, to, fluid, loss, and, restricts, them, to, environments, where, dehydration, is, unlikely, sea, and, freshwater, moist, terrestrial, environments, such, as, leaf, litter, or, between, grains, of, soil, and, as, parasites, within, other, animals, the, space, between, the, skin, and, gut, is, filled, with, mesenchyme, also, known, as, parenchyma, a, connective, tissue, made, of, cells, and, reinforced, by, collagen, fibers, that, act, as, a, type, of, skeleton, providing, attachment, points, for, muscles, the, mesenchyme, contains, all, the, internal, organs, and, allows, the, passage, of, oxygen, nutrients, and, waste, products, it, consists, of, two, main, types, of, cell, fixed, cells, some, of, which, have, fluid, filled, vacuoles, and, stem, cells, which, can, transform, into, any, other, type, of, cell, and, are, used, in, regenerating, tissues, after, injury, or, asexual, reproduction, most, platyhelminths, have, no, anus, and, regurgitate, undigested, material, through, the, mouth, the, genus, paracatenula, whose, members, include, tiny, flatworms, living, in, symbiosis, with, bacteria, is, even, missing, a, mouth, and, a, gut, however, some, long, species, have, an, anus, and, some, with, complex, branched, guts, have, more, than, one, anus, since, excretion, only, through, the, mouth, would, be, difficult, for, them, the, gut, is, lined, with, a, single, layer, of, endodermal, cells, that, absorb, and, digest, food, some, species, break, up, and, soften, food, first, by, secreting, enzymes, in, the, gut, or, pharynx, throat, all, animals, need, to, keep, the, concentration, of, dissolved, substances, in, their, body, fluids, at, a, fairly, constant, level, internal, parasites, and, free, living, marine, animals, live, in, environments, with, high, concentrations, of, dissolved, material, and, generally, let, their, tissues, have, the, same, level, of, concentration, as, the, environment, while, freshwater, animals, need, to, prevent, their, body, fluids, from, becoming, too, dilute, despite, this, difference, in, environments, most, platyhelminths, use, the, same, system, to, control, the, concentration, of, their, body, fluids, flame, cells, so, called, because, the, beating, of, their, flagella, looks, like, a, flickering, candle, flame, extract, from, the, mesenchyme, water, that, contains, wastes, and, some, reusable, material, and, drive, it, into, networks, of, tube, cells, which, are, lined, with, flagella, and, microvilli, the, tube, cells, flagella, drive, the, water, towards, exits, called, nephridiopores, while, their, microvilli, reabsorb, reusable, materials, and, as, much, water, as, is, needed, to, keep, the, body, fluids, at, the, right, concentration, these, combinations, of, flame, cells, and, tube, cells, are, called, protonephridia, in, all, platyhelminths, the, nervous, system, is, concentrated, at, the, head, end, other, platyhelminths, have, rings, of, ganglia, in, the, head, and, main, nerve, trunks, running, along, their, bodies, early, classification, divided, the, flatworms, in, four, groups, turbellaria, trematoda, monogenea, and, cestoda, this, classification, had, long, been, recognized, to, be, artificial, and, in, 1985, ehlers, proposed, a, phylogenetically, more, correct, classification, where, the, massively, polyphyletic, turbellaria, was, split, into, a, dozen, orders, and, trematoda, monogenea, and, cestoda, were, joined, in, the, new, order, neodermata, however, the, classification, presented, here, is, the, early, traditional, classification, as, it, still, is, the, one, used, everywhere, except, in, scientific, articles, these, have, about, 4, 500, species, are, mostly, free, living, and, range, from, 1, mm, 0, 04, in, to, 600, mm, 24, in, in, length, most, are, predators, or, scavengers, and, terrestrial, species, are, mostly, nocturnal, and, live, in, shaded, humid, locations, such, as, leaf, litter, or, rotting, wood, however, some, are, symbiotes, of, other, animals, such, as, crustaceans, and, some, are, parasites, free, living, turbellarians, are, mostly, black, brown, or, gray, but, some, larger, ones, are, brightly, colored, the, acoela, and, nemertodermatida, were, traditionally, regarded, as, turbellarians, but, are, now, regarded, as, members, of, a, separate, phylum, the, acoelomorpha, or, as, two, separate, phyla, xenoturbella, a, genus, of, very, simple, animals, has, also, been, reclassified, as, a, separate, phylum, some, turbellarians, have, a, simple, pharynx, lined, with, cilia, and, generally, feed, by, using, cilia, to, sweep, food, particles, and, small, prey, into, their, mouths, which, are, usually, in, the, middle, of, their, undersides, most, other, turbellarians, have, a, pharynx, that, is, eversible, can, be, extended, by, being, turned, inside, out, and, the, mouths, of, different, species, can, be, anywhere, along, the, underside, the, freshwater, species, microstomum, caudatum, can, open, its, mouth, almost, as, wide, as, its, body, is, long, to, swallow, prey, about, as, large, as, itself, predatory, species, in, suborder, kalyptorhynchia, often, have, a, muscular, pharynx, equipped, with, hooks, or, teeth, used, for, seizing, prey, most, turbellarians, have, pigment, cup, ocelli, little, eyes, one, pair, in, most, species, but, two, or, even, three, pairs, in, others, a, few, large, species, have, many, eyes, in, clusters, over, the, brain, mounted, on, tentacles, or, spaced, uniformly, around, the, edge, of, the, body, the, ocelli, can, only, distinguish, the, direction, from, which, light, is, coming, to, enable, the, animals, to, avoid, it, a, few, groups, have, statocysts, fluid, filled, chambers, containing, a, small, solid, particle, or, in, a, few, groups, two, these, statocysts, are, thought, to, function, as, balance, and, acceleration, sensors, as, they, perform, the, same, way, in, cnidarian, medusae, and, in, ctenophores, however, turbellarian, statocysts, have, no, sensory, cilia, so, the, way, they, sense, the, movements, and, positions, of, solid, particles, is, unknown, on, the, other, hand, most, have, ciliated, touch, sensor, cells, scattered, over, their, bodies, especially, on, tentacles, and, around, the, edges, specialized, cells, in, pits, or, grooves, on, the, head, are, most, likely, smell, sensors, planarians, a, subgroup, of, seriates, are, famous, for, their, ability, to, regenerate, if, divided, by, cuts, across, their, bodies, experiments, show, that, in, fragments, that, do, not, already, have, a, head, a, new, head, grows, most, quickly, on, those, fragments, which, were, originally, located, closest, to, the, original, head, this, suggests, the, growth, of, a, head, is, controlled, by, a, chemical, whose, concentration, diminishes, throughout, the, organism, from, head, to, tail, many, turbellarians, clone, themselves, by, transverse, or, longitudinal, division, whilst, others, reproduce, by, budding, the, vast, majority, of, turbellarians, are, hermaphrodites, they, have, both, female, and, male, reproductive, cells, which, fertilize, eggs, internally, by, copulation, some, of, the, larger, aquatic, species, mate, by, penis, fencing, a, duel, in, which, each, tries, to, impregnate, the, other, and, the, loser, adopts, the, female, role, of, developing, the, eggs, in, most, species, miniature, adults, emerge, when, the, eggs, hatch, but, a, few, large, species, produce, plankton, like, larvae, these, parasites, name, refers, to, the, cavities, in, their, holdfasts, greek, hole, which, resemble, suckers, and, anchor, them, within, their, hosts, the, skin, of, all, species, is, a, syncitium, which, is, a, layer, of, cells, that, shares, a, single, external, membrane, trematodes, are, divided, into, two, groups, digenea, and, aspidogastrea, also, known, as, aspodibothrea, these, are, often, called, flukes, as, most, have, flat, rhomboid, shapes, like, that, of, a, flounder, old, english, fl, c, there, are, about, 11, 000, species, more, than, all, other, platyhelminthes, combined, and, second, only, to, roundworms, among, parasites, on, metazoans, adults, usually, have, two, holdfasts, a, ring, around, the, mouth, and, a, larger, sucker, midway, along, what, would, be, the, underside, in, a, free, living, flatworm, although, the, name, digeneans, means, two, generations, most, have, very, complex, life, cycles, with, up, to, seven, stages, depending, on, what, combinations, of, environments, the, early, stages, encounter, the, most, important, factor, being, whether, the, eggs, are, deposited, on, land, or, in, water, the, intermediate, stages, transfer, the, parasites, from, one, host, to, another, the, definitive, host, in, which, adults, develop, is, a, land, vertebrate, the, earliest, host, of, juvenile, stages, is, usually, a, snail, that, may, live, on, land, or, in, water, whilst, in, many, cases, a, fish, or, arthropod, is, the, second, host, for, example, the, adjoining, illustration, shows, the, life, cycle, of, the, intestinal, fluke, metagonimus, which, hatches, in, the, intestine, of, a, snail, then, moves, to, a, fish, where, it, penetrates, the, body, and, encysts, in, the, flesh, then, migrating, to, the, small, intestine, of, a, land, animal, that, eats, the, fish, raw, finally, generating, eggs, that, are, excreted, and, ingested, by, snails, thereby, completing, the, cycle, a, similar, life, cycle, occurs, with, opisthorchis, viverrini, which, is, found, in, south, east, asia, and, can, infect, the, liver, of, humans, causing, cholangiocarcinoma, bile, duct, cancer, schistosomes, which, cause, the, devastating, tropical, disease, bilharzia, also, belong, to, this, group, adults, range, between, 0, 2, mm, 0, 0079, in, and, 6, mm, 0, 24, in, in, length, individual, adult, digeneans, are, of, a, single, sex, and, in, some, species, slender, females, live, in, enclosed, grooves, that, run, along, the, bodies, of, the, males, partially, emerging, to, lay, eggs, in, all, species, the, adults, have, complex, reproductive, systems, capable, of, producing, between, 10, 000, and, 100, 000, times, as, many, eggs, as, a, free, living, flatworm, in, addition, the, intermediate, stages, that, live, in, snails, reproduce, asexually, adults, of, different, species, infest, different, parts, of, the, definitive, host, for, example, the, intestine, lungs, large, blood, vessels, and, liver, the, adults, use, a, relatively, large, muscular, pharynx, to, ingest, cells, cell, fragments, mucus, body, fluids, or, blood, in, both, the, adult, and, snail, inhabiting, stages, the, external, syncytium, absorbs, dissolved, nutrients, from, the, host, adult, digeneans, can, live, without, oxygen, for, long, periods, members, of, this, small, group, have, either, a, single, divided, sucker, or, a, row, of, suckers, that, cover, the, underside, they, infest, the, guts, of, bony, or, cartilaginous, fish, turtles, or, the, body, cavities, of, marine, and, freshwater, bivalves, and, gastropods, their, eggs, produce, ciliated, swimming, larvae, and, the, life, cycle, has, one, or, two, hosts, these, parasites, attach, themselves, to, their, hosts, by, means, of, disks, that, bear, crescent, shaped, hooks, they, are, divided, into, the, monogenea, and, cestoda, groupings, of, about, 1, 100, species, of, monogeneans, most, are, external, parasites, that, require, particular, host, species, mainly, fish, but, in, some, cases, amphibians, or, aquatic, reptiles, however, a, few, are, internal, parasites, adult, monogeneans, have, large, attachment, organs, at, the, rear, known, as, haptors, greek, haptein, means, catch, which, have, suckers, clamps, and, hooks, they, often, have, flattened, bodies, in, some, species, the, pharynx, secretes, enzymes, to, digest, the, host, s, skin, allowing, the, parasite, to, feed, on, blood, and, cellular, debris, others, graze, externally, on, mucus, and, flakes, of, the, hosts, skins, the, name, monogenea, is, based, on, the, fact, that, these, parasites, have, only, one, nonlarval, generation, these, are, often, called, tapeworms, because, of, their, flat, slender, but, very, long, bodies, the, name, cestode, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, cestus, which, means, tape, the, adults, of, all, 3, 400, cestode, species, are, internal, parasites, cestodes, have, no, mouths, or, guts, and, the, syncitial, skin, absorbs, nutrients, mainly, carbohydrates, and, amino, acids, from, the, host, and, also, disguises, it, chemically, to, avoid, attacks, by, the, host, s, immune, system, shortage, of, carbohydrates, in, the, host, s, diet, stunts, the, growth, of, parasites, and, may, even, kill, them, their, metabolisms, generally, use, simple, but, inefficient, chemical, processes, compensating, for, this, inefficiency, by, consuming, large, amounts, of, food, relative, to, their, physical, size, in, the, majority, of, species, known, as, eucestodes, true, tapeworms, the, neck, produces, a, chain, of, segments, called, proglottids, via, a, process, known, as, strobilation, as, a, result, the, most, mature, proglottids, are, furthest, from, the, scolex, adults, of, taenia, saginata, which, infests, humans, can, form, proglottid, chains, over, 20, metres, 66, ft, long, although, 4, metres, 13, ft, is, more, typical, each, proglottid, has, both, male, and, female, reproductive, organs, if, the, host, s, gut, contains, two, or, more, adults, of, the, same, cestode, species, they, generally, fertilize, each, other, however, proglottids, of, the, same, worm, can, fertilize, each, other, and, even, themselves, when, the, eggs, are, fully, developed, the, proglottids, separate, and, are, excreted, by, the, host, the, eucestode, life, cycle, is, less, complex, than, that, of, digeneans, but, varies, depending, on, the, species, for, example, members, of, the, smaller, group, known, as, cestodaria, have, no, scolex, do, not, produce, proglottids, and, have, body, shapes, similar, to, those, of, diageneans, cestodarians, parasitize, fish, and, turtles, the, relationships, of, platyhelminthes, to, other, bilateria, are, shown, in, the, phylogenetic, tree, acoelomorpha, deuterostomia, ecdysozoa, gnathifera, gastrotricha, platyhelminthes, mollusca, annelida, the, internal, relationships, of, platyhelminthes, are, shown, below, the, tree, is, not, fully, resolved, catenulida, haplopharyngida, macrostomida, prorhynchida, polycladida, gnosonesimida, kalyptorhynchia, dalytyphloplanida, proseriata, prolecithophora, fecampiida, tricladida, planarians, bothrioplanida, freshwater, neodermata, flukes, tapeworms, the, oldest, confidently, identified, parasitic, flatworm, fossils, are, cestode, eggs, found, in, a, permian, shark, coprolite, but, helminth, hooks, still, attached, to, devonian, acanthodians, and, placoderms, might, also, represent, parasitic, flatworms, with, simple, life, cycles, the, oldest, known, free, living, platyhelminth, specimen, is, a, fossil, preserved, in, eocene, age, baltic, amber, and, placed, in, the, monotypic, species, micropalaeosoma, balticus, whilst, the, oldest, subfossil, specimens, are, schistosome, eggs, discovered, in, ancient, egyptian, mummies, the, platyhelminthes, have, very, few, synapomorphies, distinguishing, features, that, all, platyhelminthes, but, no, other, animals, exhibit, this, makes, it, difficult, to, work, out, their, relationships, with, other, groups, of, animals, as, well, as, the, relationships, between, different, groups, that, are, described, as, members, of, the, platyhelminthes, the, traditional, view, before, the, 1990s, was, that, platyhelminthes, formed, the, sister, group, to, all, the, other, bilaterians, which, include, for, instance, arthropods, molluscs, annelids, and, chordates, since, then, molecular, phylogenetics, which, aims, to, work, out, evolutionary, family, trees, by, comparing, different, organisms, biochemicals, such, as, dna, rna, and, proteins, has, radically, changed, scientists, view, of, evolutionary, relationships, between, animals, flatworms, are, now, recognized, as, secondarily, simplified, bilaterians, detailed, morphological, analyses, of, anatomical, features, in, the, mid, 1980s, as, well, as, molecular, phylogenetics, analyses, since, 2000, using, different, sections, of, dna, agree, that, acoelomorpha, consisting, of, acoela, traditionally, regarded, as, very, simple, turbellarians, and, nemertodermatida, another, small, group, previously, classified, as, turbellarians, are, the, sister, group, to, all, other, bilaterians, however, a, 2007, study, concluded, that, acoela, and, nemertodermatida, were, two, distinct, groups, of, bilaterians, xenoturbella, a, bilaterian, whose, only, well, defined, organ, is, a, statocyst, was, originally, classified, as, a, primitive, turbellarian, later, studies, suggested, it, may, instead, be, a, deuterostome, but, more, detailed, molecular, phylogenetics, have, led, to, its, classification, as, sister, group, to, the, acoelomorpha, the, platyhelminthes, excluding, acoelomorpha, contain, two, main, groups, catenulida, and, rhabditophora, both, of, which, are, generally, agreed, to, be, monophyletic, each, contains, all, and, only, the, descendants, of, an, ancestor, that, is, a, member, of, the, same, group, early, molecular, phylogenetics, analyses, of, the, catenulida, and, rhabditophora, left, uncertainties, about, whether, these, could, be, combined, in, a, single, monophyletic, group, a, study, in, 2008, concluded, that, they, could, therefore, platyhelminthes, could, be, redefined, as, catenulida, plus, rhabditophora, excluding, the, acoelomorpha, other, molecular, phylogenetics, analyses, agree, the, redefined, platyhelminthes, are, most, closely, related, to, gastrotricha, and, both, are, part, of, a, grouping, known, as, platyzoa, platyzoa, are, generally, agreed, to, be, at, least, closely, related, to, the, lophotrochozoa, a, super, phylum, that, includes, molluscs, and, annelid, worms, the, majority, view, is, that, platyzoa, are, part, of, lophotrochozoa, but, a, significant, minority, of, researchers, regard, platyzoa, as, a, sister, group, of, lophotrochozoa, it, has, been, agreed, since, 1985, that, each, of, the, wholly, parasitic, platyhelminth, groups, cestoda, monogenea, and, trematoda, is, monophyletic, and, that, together, these, form, a, larger, monophyletic, grouping, the, neodermata, in, which, the, adults, of, all, members, have, syncytial, skins, however, there, is, debate, about, whether, the, cestoda, and, monogenea, can, be, combined, as, an, intermediate, monophyletic, group, the, cercomeromorpha, within, the, neodermata, it, is, generally, agreed, that, the, neodermata, are, a, sub, group, a, few, levels, down, in, the, family, tree, of, the, rhabditophora, hence, the, traditional, sub, phylum, turbellaria, is, paraphyletic, since, it, does, not, include, the, neodermata, although, these, are, descendants, of, a, sub, group, of, turbellarians, an, outline, of, the, origins, of, the, parasitic, lifestyle, has, been, proposed, epithelial, feeding, monopisthocotyleans, on, fish, hosts, are, basal, in, the, neodermata, and, were, the, first, shift, to, parasitism, from, free, living, ancestors, the, next, evolutionary, step, was, a, dietary, change, from, epithelium, to, blood, the, last, common, ancestor, of, digenea, cestoda, was, monogenean, and, most, likely, sanguinivorous, in, several, members, of, the, order, rhabdocoela, an, endosymbiotic, relationship, with, microalgae, has, evolved, some, species, in, the, same, order, has, also, evolved, kleptoplasty, the, earliest, known, fossils, confidently, classified, as, tapeworms, have, been, dated, to, 270, million, years, ago, after, being, found, in, coprolites, fossilised, faeces, from, an, elasmobranch, putative, older, fossils, include, a, ribbon, shaped, bilaterally, symmetrical, organism, named, rugosusivitta, orthogonia, from, the, early, cambrian, of, china, brownish, bodies, on, the, bedding, planes, reported, from, the, late, ordovician, katian, vaur, al, formation, canada, by, knaust, desrochers, 2019, tentatively, interpreted, as, turbellarians, though, the, authors, cautioned, that, they, might, ultimately, turn, out, to, be, fossils, of, acoelomorphs, or, nemerteans, and, circlets, of, fossil, hooks, preserved, with, placoderm, and, acanthodian, fossils, from, the, devonian, of, latvia, at, least, some, of, which, might, represent, parasitic, monogeneans, cestodes, tapeworms, and, digeneans, flukes, cause, diseases, in, humans, and, their, livestock, whilst, monogeneans, can, cause, serious, losses, of, stocks, in, fish, farms, schistosomiasis, also, known, as, bilharzia, or, snail, fever, is, the, second, most, devastating, parasitic, disease, in, tropical, countries, behind, malaria, the, carter, center, estimated, 200, million, people, in, 74, countries, are, infected, with, the, disease, and, half, the, victims, live, in, africa, the, condition, has, a, low, mortality, rate, but, usually, presents, as, a, chronic, illness, that, can, damage, internal, organs, it, can, impair, the, growth, and, cognitive, development, of, children, increasing, the, risk, of, bladder, cancer, in, adults, the, disease, is, caused, by, several, flukes, of, the, genus, schistosoma, which, can, bore, through, human, skin, those, most, at, risk, use, infected, bodies, of, water, for, recreation, or, laundry, in, 2000, an, estimated, 45, million, people, were, infected, with, the, beef, tapeworm, taenia, saginata, and, 3, million, with, the, pork, tapeworm, taenia, solium, infection, of, the, digestive, system, by, adult, tapeworms, causes, abdominal, symptoms, that, whilst, unpleasant, are, seldom, disabling, or, life, threatening, however, neurocysticercosis, resulting, from, penetration, of, t, solium, larvae, into, the, central, nervous, system, is, the, major, cause, of, acquired, epilepsy, worldwide, in, 2000, about, 39, million, people, were, infected, with, trematodes, flukes, that, naturally, parasitize, fish, and, crustaceans, but, can, pass, to, humans, who, eat, raw, or, lightly, cooked, seafood, infection, of, humans, by, the, broad, fish, tapeworm, diphyllobothrium, latum, occasionally, causes, vitamin, b, 12, deficiency, and, in, severe, cases, megaloblastic, anemia, the, threat, to, humans, in, developed, countries, is, rising, as, a, result, of, social, trends, the, increase, in, organic, farming, which, uses, manure, and, sewage, sludge, rather, than, artificial, fertilizers, spreads, parasites, both, directly, and, via, the, droppings, of, seagulls, which, feed, on, manure, and, sludge, the, increasing, popularity, of, raw, or, lightly, cooked, foods, imports, of, meat, seafood, and, salad, vegetables, from, high, risk, areas, and, as, an, underlying, cause, reduced, awareness, of, parasites, compared, with, other, public, health, issues, such, as, pollution, in, less, developed, countries, inadequate, sanitation, and, the, use, of, human, feces, night, soil, as, fertilizer, or, to, enrich, fish, farm, ponds, continues, to, spread, parasitic, platyhelminths, whilst, poorly, designed, water, supply, and, irrigation, projects, have, provided, additional, channels, for, their, spread, people, in, these, countries, usually, cannot, afford, the, cost, of, fuel, required, to, cook, food, thoroughly, enough, to, kill, parasites, controlling, parasites, that, infect, humans, and, livestock, has, become, more, difficult, as, many, species, have, become, resistant, to, drugs, that, used, to, be, effective, mainly, for, killing, juveniles, in, meat, while, poorer, countries, still, struggle, with, unintentional, infection, cases, have, been, reported, of, intentional, infection, in, the, us, by, dieters, who, are, desperate, for, rapid, weight, loss, there, is, concern, in, northwest, europe, including, the, british, isles, regarding, the, possible, proliferation, of, the, new, zealand, planarian, arthurdendyus, triangulatus, and, the, australian, flatworm, australoplana, sanguinea, both, of, which, prey, on, earthworms, a, triangulatus, is, thought, to, have, reached, europe, in, containers, of, plants, imported, by, botanical, gardens, in, hawaii, the, planarian, endeavouria, septemlineata, has, been, used, to, control, the, imported, giant, african, snail, achatina, fulica, which, was, displacing, native, snails, platydemus, manokwari, another, planarian, has, been, used, for, the, same, purpose, in, philippines, indonesia, new, guinea, and, guam, although, a, fulica, has, declined, sharply, in, hawaii, there, are, doubts, about, how, much, e, septemlineata, contributed, to, this, decline, however, p, manokwari, is, given, credit, for, severely, reducing, and, in, places, exterminating, a, fulica, achieving, much, greater, success, than, most, biological, pest, control, programs, which, generally, aim, for, a, low, stable, population, of, the, pest, species, the, ability, of, planarians, to, take, different, kinds, of, prey, and, to, resist, starvation, may, account, for, their, ability, to, decimate, a, fulica, however, these, planarians, are, a, serious, threat, to, native, snails, and, should, never, be, used, for, biological, control, a, study, in, argentina, shows, the, potential, for, planarians, such, as, girardia, anceps, mesostoma, ehrenbergii, and, bothromesostoma, evelinae, to, reduce, populations, of, the, mosquito, species, aedes, aegypti, and, culex, pipiens, the, experiment, showed, that, g, anceps, can, prey, on, all, instars, of, both, mosquito, species, yet, maintain, a, steady, predation, rate, over, time, the, ability, of, these, flatworms, to, live, in, artificial, containers, demonstrated, the, potential, of, placing, these, species, in, popular, mosquito, breeding, sites, which, might, reduce, the, amount, of, mosquito, borne, disease
