anemia, or, anaemia, british, english, is, a, blood, disorder, in, which, the, blood, has, a, reduced, ability, to, carry, oxygen, this, can, be, due, to, a, lower, than, normal, number, of, red, blood, cells, a, reduction, in, the, amount, of, hemoglobin, available, for, oxygen, transport, or, abnormalities, in, hemoglobin, that, impair, its, function, the, name, is, derived, from, ancient, greek, an, not, and, haima, blood, when, anemia, comes, on, slowly, the, symptoms, are, often, vague, such, as, tiredness, weakness, shortness, of, breath, headaches, and, a, reduced, ability, to, exercise, when, anemia, is, acute, symptoms, may, include, confusion, feeling, like, one, is, going, to, pass, out, loss, of, consciousness, and, increased, thirst, anemia, must, be, significant, before, a, person, becomes, noticeably, pale, additional, symptoms, may, occur, depending, on, the, underlying, cause, anemia, can, be, temporary, or, long, term, and, can, range, from, mild, to, severe, anemia, can, be, caused, by, blood, loss, decreased, red, blood, cell, production, and, increased, red, blood, cell, breakdown, causes, of, blood, loss, include, bleeding, due, to, inflammation, of, the, stomach, or, intestines, bleeding, from, surgery, serious, injury, or, blood, donation, causes, of, decreased, production, include, iron, deficiency, folate, deficiency, vitamin, b, 12, deficiency, thalassemia, and, a, number, of, bone, marrow, tumors, causes, of, increased, breakdown, include, genetic, disorders, such, as, sickle, cell, anemia, infections, such, as, malaria, and, certain, autoimmune, diseases, anemia, can, also, be, classified, based, on, the, size, of, the, red, blood, cells, and, amount, of, hemoglobin, in, each, cell, if, the, cells, are, small, it, is, called, microcytic, anemia, if, they, are, large, it, is, called, macrocytic, anemia, and, if, they, are, normal, sized, it, is, called, normocytic, anemia, the, diagnosis, of, anemia, in, men, is, based, on, a, hemoglobin, of, less, than, 130, to, 140, g, l, 13, to, 14, g, dl, in, women, it, is, less, than, 120, to, 130, g, l, 12, to, 13, g, dl, further, testing, is, then, required, to, determine, the, cause, treatment, depends, on, the, specific, cause, certain, groups, of, individuals, such, as, pregnant, women, can, benefit, from, the, use, of, iron, pills, for, prevention, dietary, supplementation, without, determining, the, specific, cause, is, not, recommended, the, use, of, blood, transfusions, is, typically, based, on, a, person, s, signs, and, symptoms, in, those, without, symptoms, they, are, not, recommended, unless, hemoglobin, levels, are, less, than, 60, to, 80, g, l, 6, to, 8, g, dl, these, recommendations, may, also, apply, to, some, people, with, acute, bleeding, erythropoiesis, stimulating, agents, are, only, recommended, in, those, with, severe, anemia, anemia, is, the, most, common, blood, disorder, affecting, about, a, fifth, to, a, third, of, the, global, population, iron, deficiency, anemia, is, the, most, common, cause, of, anemia, worldwide, and, affects, nearly, one, billion, people, in, 2013, anemia, due, to, iron, deficiency, resulted, in, about, 183, 000, deaths, down, from, 213, 000, deaths, in, 1990, this, condition, is, most, prevalent, in, children, with, also, an, above, average, prevalence, in, elderly, and, women, of, reproductive, age, especially, during, pregnancy, anemia, is, one, of, the, six, who, global, nutrition, targets, for, 2025, and, for, diet, related, global, targets, endorsed, by, world, health, assembly, in, 2012, and, 2013, efforts, to, reach, global, targets, contribute, to, reaching, sustainable, development, goals, sdgs, with, anemia, as, one, of, the, targets, in, sdg, 2, for, achieving, zero, world, hunger, a, person, with, anemia, may, not, have, any, symptoms, depending, on, the, underlying, cause, and, no, symptoms, may, be, noticed, as, the, anemia, is, initially, mild, and, then, the, symptoms, become, worse, as, the, anemia, worsens, a, patient, with, anemia, may, report, feeling, tired, weak, decreased, ability, to, concentrate, and, sometimes, shortness, of, breath, on, exertion, these, symptoms, are, unspecific, and, none, of, the, symptoms, alone, or, in, combination, show, a, good, predictive, value, for, the, presence, of, anemia, in, non, clinical, patients, symptoms, of, anemia, can, come, on, quickly, or, slowly, early, on, there, may, be, few, or, no, symptoms, if, the, anemia, continues, slowly, chronic, the, body, may, adapt, and, compensate, for, this, change, in, this, case, no, symptoms, may, appear, until, the, anemia, becomes, more, severe, symptoms, can, include, feeling, tired, weak, dizziness, headaches, intolerance, to, physical, exertion, shortness, of, breath, difficulty, concentrating, irregular, or, rapid, heartbeat, cold, hands, and, feet, cold, intolerance, pale, or, yellow, skin, poor, appetite, easy, bruising, and, bleeding, and, muscle, weakness, anemia, that, develops, quickly, often, has, more, severe, symptoms, including, feeling, faint, chest, pain, sweating, increased, thirst, and, confusion, there, may, be, also, additional, symptoms, depending, on, the, underlying, cause, in, more, severe, anemia, the, body, may, compensate, for, the, lack, of, oxygen, carrying, capability, of, the, blood, by, increasing, cardiac, output, the, person, may, have, symptoms, related, to, this, such, as, palpitations, angina, if, pre, existing, heart, disease, is, present, intermittent, claudication, of, the, legs, and, symptoms, of, heart, failure, on, examination, the, signs, exhibited, may, include, pallor, pale, skin, mucosa, conjunctiva, and, nail, beds, but, this, is, not, a, reliable, sign, a, blue, coloration, of, the, sclera, may, be, noticed, in, some, cases, of, iron, deficiency, anemia, there, may, be, signs, of, specific, causes, of, anemia, e, g, koilonychia, in, iron, deficiency, jaundice, when, anemia, results, from, abnormal, break, down, of, red, blood, cells, in, hemolytic, anemia, nerve, cell, damage, vitamin, b, 12, deficiency, bone, deformities, found, in, thalassemia, major, or, leg, ulcers, seen, in, sickle, cell, disease, in, severe, anemia, there, may, be, signs, of, a, hyperdynamic, circulation, tachycardia, a, fast, heart, rate, bounding, pulse, flow, murmurs, and, cardiac, ventricular, hypertrophy, enlargement, there, may, be, signs, of, heart, failure, pica, the, consumption, of, non, food, items, such, as, ice, paper, wax, grass, hair, or, dirt, may, be, a, symptom, of, iron, deficiency, although, it, occurs, often, in, those, who, have, normal, levels, of, hemoglobin, chronic, anemia, may, result, in, behavioral, disturbances, in, children, as, a, direct, result, of, impaired, neurological, development, in, infants, and, reduced, academic, performance, in, children, of, school, age, restless, legs, syndrome, is, more, common, in, people, with, iron, deficiency, anemia, than, in, the, general, population, the, causes, of, anemia, may, be, classified, as, impaired, red, blood, cell, rbc, production, increased, rbc, destruction, hemolytic, anemia, blood, loss, and, fluid, overload, hypervolemia, several, of, these, may, interplay, to, cause, anemia, the, most, common, cause, of, anemia, is, blood, loss, but, this, usually, does, not, cause, any, lasting, symptoms, unless, a, relatively, impaired, rbc, production, develops, in, turn, most, commonly, by, iron, deficiency, anemias, of, increased, red, blood, cell, destruction, are, generally, classified, as, hemolytic, anemias, these, types, generally, feature, jaundice, and, elevated, levels, of, lactate, dehydrogenase, the, roots, of, the, words, anemia, and, ischemia, both, refer, to, the, basic, idea, of, lack, of, blood, but, anemia, and, ischemia, are, not, the, same, thing, in, modern, medical, terminology, the, word, anemia, used, alone, implies, widespread, effects, from, blood, that, either, is, too, scarce, e, g, blood, loss, or, is, dysfunctional, in, its, oxygen, supplying, ability, due, to, whatever, type, of, hemoglobin, or, erythrocyte, problem, in, contrast, the, word, ischemia, refers, solely, to, the, lack, of, blood, poor, perfusion, thus, ischemia, in, a, body, part, can, cause, localized, anemic, effects, within, those, tissues, fluid, overload, hypervolemia, causes, decreased, hemoglobin, concentration, and, apparent, anemia, certain, gastrointestinal, disorders, can, cause, anemia, the, mechanisms, involved, are, multifactorial, and, not, limited, to, malabsorption, but, mainly, related, to, chronic, intestinal, inflammation, which, causes, dysregulation, of, hepcidin, that, leads, to, decreased, access, of, iron, to, the, circulation, there, are, a, number, of, definitions, of, anemia, reviews, provide, comparison, and, contrast, of, them, a, strict, but, broad, definition, is, an, absolute, decrease, in, red, blood, cell, mass, however, a, broader, definition, is, a, lowered, ability, of, the, blood, to, carry, oxygen, an, operational, definition, is, a, decrease, in, whole, blood, hemoglobin, concentration, of, more, than, 2, standard, deviations, below, the, mean, of, an, age, and, sex, matched, reference, range, it, is, difficult, to, directly, measure, rbc, mass, so, the, hematocrit, amount, of, rbcs, or, the, hemoglobin, hb, in, the, blood, are, often, used, instead, to, indirectly, estimate, the, value, hematocrit, however, is, concentration, dependent, and, is, therefore, not, completely, accurate, for, example, during, pregnancy, a, woman, s, rbc, mass, is, normal, but, because, of, an, increase, in, blood, volume, the, hemoglobin, and, hematocrit, are, diluted, and, thus, decreased, another, example, would, be, bleeding, where, the, rbc, mass, would, decrease, but, the, concentrations, of, hemoglobin, and, hematocrit, initially, remains, normal, until, fluids, shift, from, other, areas, of, the, body, to, the, intravascular, space, the, anemia, is, also, classified, by, severity, into, mild, 110, g, l, to, normal, moderate, 80, g, l, to, 110, g, l, and, severe, anemia, less, than, 80, g, l, in, adults, different, values, are, used, in, pregnancy, and, children, anemia, is, typically, diagnosed, on, a, complete, blood, count, apart, from, reporting, the, number, of, red, blood, cells, and, the, hemoglobin, level, the, automatic, counters, also, measure, the, size, of, the, red, blood, cells, by, flow, cytometry, which, is, an, important, tool, in, distinguishing, between, the, causes, of, anemia, examination, of, a, stained, blood, smear, using, a, microscope, can, also, be, helpful, and, it, is, sometimes, a, necessity, in, regions, of, the, world, where, automated, analysis, is, less, accessible, a, blood, test, will, provide, counts, of, white, blood, cells, red, blood, cells, and, platelets, if, anemia, appears, further, tests, may, determine, what, type, it, is, and, whether, it, has, a, serious, cause, although, of, that, it, is, possible, to, refer, to, the, genetic, history, and, physical, diagnosis, these, tests, may, also, include, serum, ferritin, iron, studies, vitamin, b, 12, genetic, testing, and, a, bone, marrow, sample, if, needed, reticulocyte, counts, and, the, kinetic, approach, to, anemia, have, become, more, common, than, in, the, past, in, the, large, medical, centers, of, the, united, states, and, some, other, wealthy, nations, in, part, because, some, automatic, counters, now, have, the, capacity, to, include, reticulocyte, counts, a, reticulocyte, count, is, a, quantitative, measure, of, the, bone, marrow, s, production, of, new, red, blood, cells, the, reticulocyte, production, index, is, a, calculation, of, the, ratio, between, the, level, of, anemia, and, the, extent, to, which, the, reticulocyte, count, has, risen, in, response, if, the, degree, of, anemia, is, significant, even, a, normal, reticulocyte, count, actually, may, reflect, an, inadequate, response, if, an, automated, count, is, not, available, a, reticulocyte, count, can, be, done, manually, following, special, staining, of, the, blood, film, in, manual, examination, activity, of, the, bone, marrow, can, also, be, gauged, qualitatively, by, subtle, changes, in, the, numbers, and, the, morphology, of, young, rbcs, by, examination, under, a, microscope, newly, formed, rbcs, are, usually, slightly, larger, than, older, rbcs, and, show, polychromasia, even, where, the, source, of, blood, loss, is, obvious, evaluation, of, erythropoiesis, can, help, assess, whether, the, bone, marrow, will, be, able, to, compensate, for, the, loss, and, at, what, rate, when, the, cause, is, not, obvious, clinicians, use, other, tests, such, as, esr, serum, iron, transferrin, rbc, folate, level, hemoglobin, electrophoresis, renal, function, tests, e, g, serum, creatinine, although, the, tests, will, depend, on, the, clinical, hypothesis, that, is, being, investigated, when, the, diagnosis, remains, difficult, a, bone, marrow, examination, allows, direct, examination, of, the, precursors, to, red, cells, although, is, rarely, used, as, is, painful, invasive, and, is, hence, reserved, for, cases, where, severe, pathology, needs, to, be, determined, or, excluded, in, the, morphological, approach, anemia, is, classified, by, the, size, of, red, blood, cells, this, is, either, done, automatically, or, on, microscopic, examination, of, a, peripheral, blood, smear, the, size, is, reflected, in, the, mean, corpuscular, volume, mcv, if, the, cells, are, smaller, than, normal, under, 80, fl, the, anemia, is, said, to, be, microcytic, if, they, are, normal, size, 80, 100, fl, normocytic, and, if, they, are, larger, than, normal, over, 100, fl, the, anemia, is, classified, as, macrocytic, this, scheme, quickly, exposes, some, of, the, most, common, causes, of, anemia, for, instance, a, microcytic, anemia, is, often, the, result, of, iron, deficiency, in, clinical, workup, the, mcv, will, be, one, of, the, first, pieces, of, information, available, so, even, among, clinicians, who, consider, the, kinetic, approach, more, useful, philosophically, morphology, will, remain, an, important, element, of, classification, and, diagnosis, limitations, of, mcv, include, cases, where, the, underlying, cause, is, due, to, a, combination, of, factors, such, as, iron, deficiency, a, cause, of, microcytosis, and, vitamin, b12, deficiency, a, cause, of, macrocytosis, where, the, net, result, can, be, normocytic, cells, the, kinetic, approach, to, anemia, yields, arguably, the, most, clinically, relevant, classification, of, anemia, this, classification, depends, on, evaluation, of, several, hematological, parameters, particularly, the, blood, reticulocyte, precursor, of, mature, rbcs, count, this, then, yields, the, classification, of, defects, by, decreased, rbc, production, versus, increased, rbc, destruction, or, loss, clinical, signs, of, loss, or, destruction, include, abnormal, peripheral, blood, smear, with, signs, of, hemolysis, elevated, ldh, suggesting, cell, destruction, or, clinical, signs, of, bleeding, such, as, guaiac, positive, stool, radiographic, findings, or, frank, bleeding, the, following, is, a, simplified, schematic, of, this, approach, for, instance, sickle, cell, anemia, with, superimposed, iron, deficiency, chronic, gastric, bleeding, with, b, 12, and, folate, deficiency, and, other, instances, of, anemia, with, more, than, one, cause, confirm, by, repeating, reticulocyte, count, ongoing, combination, of, low, reticulocyte, production, index, normal, mcv, and, hemolysis, or, loss, may, be, seen, in, bone, marrow, failure, or, anemia, of, chronic, disease, with, superimposed, or, related, hemolysis, or, blood, loss, here, is, a, schematic, representation, of, how, to, consider, anemia, with, mcv, as, the, starting, point, other, characteristics, visible, on, the, peripheral, smear, may, provide, valuable, clues, about, a, more, specific, diagnosis, for, example, abnormal, white, blood, cells, may, point, to, a, cause, in, the, bone, marrow, microcytic, anemia, is, primarily, a, result, of, hemoglobin, synthesis, failure, insufficiency, which, could, be, caused, by, several, etiologies, iron, deficiency, anemia, is, the, most, common, type, of, anemia, overall, and, it, has, many, causes, rbcs, often, appear, hypochromic, paler, than, usual, and, microcytic, smaller, than, usual, when, viewed, with, a, microscope, the, mentzer, index, mean, cell, volume, divided, by, the, rbc, count, predicts, whether, microcytic, anemia, may, be, due, to, iron, deficiency, or, thalassemia, although, it, requires, confirmation, macrocytic, anemia, can, be, further, divided, into, megaloblastic, anemia, or, nonmegaloblastic, macrocytic, anemia, the, cause, of, megaloblastic, anemia, is, primarily, a, failure, of, dna, synthesis, with, preserved, rna, synthesis, which, results, in, restricted, cell, division, of, the, progenitor, cells, the, megaloblastic, anemias, often, present, with, neutrophil, hypersegmentation, six, to, 10, lobes, the, nonmegaloblastic, macrocytic, anemias, have, different, etiologies, i, e, unimpaired, dna, globin, synthesis, which, occur, for, example, in, alcoholism, in, addition, to, the, nonspecific, symptoms, of, anemia, specific, features, of, vitamin, b, 12, deficiency, include, peripheral, neuropathy, and, subacute, combined, degeneration, of, the, cord, with, resulting, balance, difficulties, from, posterior, column, spinal, cord, pathology, other, features, may, include, a, smooth, red, tongue, and, glossitis, the, treatment, for, vitamin, b, 12, deficient, anemia, was, first, devised, by, william, murphy, who, bled, dogs, to, make, them, anemic, and, then, fed, them, various, substances, to, see, what, if, anything, would, make, them, healthy, again, he, discovered, that, ingesting, large, amounts, of, liver, seemed, to, cure, the, disease, george, minot, and, george, whipple, then, set, about, to, isolate, the, curative, substance, chemically, and, ultimately, were, able, to, isolate, the, vitamin, b, 12, from, the, liver, all, three, shared, the, 1934, nobel, prize, in, medicine, normocytic, anemia, occurs, when, the, overall, hemoglobin, levels, are, decreased, but, the, red, blood, cell, size, mean, corpuscular, volume, remains, normal, causes, include, a, dimorphic, appearance, on, a, peripheral, blood, smear, occurs, when, there, are, two, simultaneous, populations, of, red, blood, cells, typically, of, different, size, and, hemoglobin, content, this, last, feature, affecting, the, color, of, the, red, blood, cell, on, a, stained, peripheral, blood, smear, for, example, a, person, recently, transfused, for, iron, deficiency, would, have, small, pale, iron, deficient, red, blood, cells, rbcs, and, the, donor, rbcs, of, normal, size, and, color, similarly, a, person, transfused, for, severe, folate, or, vitamin, b12, deficiency, would, have, two, cell, populations, but, in, this, case, the, patient, s, rbcs, would, be, larger, and, paler, than, the, donor, s, rbcs, a, person, with, sideroblastic, anemia, a, defect, in, heme, synthesis, commonly, caused, by, alcoholism, but, also, drugs, toxins, nutritional, deficiencies, a, few, acquired, and, rare, congenital, diseases, can, have, a, dimorphic, smear, from, the, sideroblastic, anemia, alone, evidence, for, multiple, causes, appears, with, an, elevated, rbc, distribution, width, rdw, indicating, a, wider, than, normal, range, of, red, cell, sizes, also, seen, in, common, nutritional, anemia, heinz, bodies, form, in, the, cytoplasm, of, rbcs, and, appear, as, small, dark, dots, under, the, microscope, in, animals, heinz, body, anemia, has, many, causes, it, may, be, drug, induced, for, example, in, cats, and, dogs, by, acetaminophen, paracetamol, or, may, be, caused, by, eating, various, plants, or, other, substances, hyperanemia, is, a, severe, form, of, anemia, in, which, the, hematocrit, is, below, 10, refractory, anemia, an, anemia, which, does, not, respond, to, treatment, is, often, seen, secondary, to, myelodysplastic, syndromes, iron, deficiency, anemia, may, also, be, refractory, as, a, manifestation, of, gastrointestinal, problems, which, disrupt, iron, absorption, or, cause, occult, bleeding, transfusion, dependent, anemia, is, a, form, of, anemia, where, ongoing, blood, transfusion, are, required, most, people, with, myelodysplastic, syndrome, develop, this, state, at, some, point, in, time, beta, thalassemia, may, also, result, in, transfusion, dependence, concerns, from, repeated, blood, transfusions, include, iron, overload, this, iron, overload, may, require, chelation, therapy, the, global, market, for, anemia, treatments, is, estimated, at, more, than, usd, 23, billion, per, year, and, is, fast, growing, because, of, the, rising, prevalence, and, awareness, of, anemia, the, types, of, anemia, treated, with, drugs, are, iron, deficiency, anemia, thalassemia, aplastic, anemia, hemolytic, anemia, sickle, cell, anemia, and, pernicious, anemia, the, most, important, of, them, being, deficiency, and, sickle, cell, anemia, with, together, 60, of, market, share, because, of, highest, prevalence, as, well, as, higher, treatment, costs, compared, with, other, types, treatment, for, anemia, depends, on, cause, and, severity, vitamin, supplements, given, orally, folic, acid, or, vitamin, b, 12, or, intramuscularly, vitamin, b, 12, will, replace, specific, deficiencies, apart, from, that, iron, supplements, antibiotics, immunosuppressant, bone, marrow, stimulants, corticosteroids, gene, therapy, and, iron, chelating, agents, are, forms, of, anemia, treatment, drugs, with, immunosuppressants, and, corticosteroids, accounting, for, 58, of, the, market, share, a, paradigm, shift, towards, gene, therapy, and, monoclonal, antibody, therapies, is, observed, nutritional, iron, deficiency, is, common, in, developing, nations, an, estimated, two, thirds, of, children, and, of, women, of, childbearing, age, in, most, developing, nations, are, estimated, to, have, iron, deficiency, without, anemia, with, one, third, of, them, having, an, iron, deficiency, with, anemia, iron, deficiency, due, to, inadequate, dietary, iron, intake, is, rare, in, men, and, postmenopausal, women, the, diagnosis, of, iron, deficiency, mandates, a, search, for, potential, sources, of, blood, loss, such, as, gastrointestinal, bleeding, from, ulcers, or, colon, cancer, mild, to, moderate, iron, deficiency, anemia, is, treated, by, oral, iron, supplementation, with, ferrous, sulfate, ferrous, fumarate, or, ferrous, gluconate, daily, iron, supplements, have, been, shown, to, be, effective, in, reducing, anemia, in, women, of, childbearing, age, when, taking, iron, supplements, stomach, upset, or, darkening, of, the, feces, are, commonly, experienced, the, stomach, upset, can, be, alleviated, by, taking, the, iron, with, food, however, this, decreases, the, amount, of, iron, absorbed, vitamin, c, aids, in, the, body, s, ability, to, absorb, iron, so, taking, oral, iron, supplements, with, orange, juice, is, of, benefit, in, the, anemia, of, chronic, kidney, disease, recombinant, erythropoietin, or, epoetin, alfa, is, recommended, to, stimulate, rbc, production, and, if, iron, deficiency, and, inflammation, are, also, present, concurrent, parenteral, iron, is, also, recommended, in, cases, where, oral, iron, has, either, proven, ineffective, would, be, too, slow, for, example, pre, operatively, or, where, absorption, is, impeded, for, example, in, cases, of, inflammation, parenteral, iron, preparations, can, be, used, parenteral, iron, can, improve, iron, stores, rapidly, and, is, also, effective, for, treating, people, with, postpartum, haemorrhage, inflammatory, bowel, disease, and, chronic, heart, failure, the, body, can, absorb, up, to, 6, mg, iron, daily, from, the, gastrointestinal, tract, in, many, cases, the, patient, has, a, deficit, of, over, 1, 000, mg, of, iron, which, would, require, several, months, to, replace, this, can, be, given, concurrently, with, erythropoietin, to, ensure, sufficient, iron, for, increased, rates, of, erythropoiesis, blood, transfusions, in, those, without, symptoms, is, not, recommended, until, the, hemoglobin, is, below, 60, to, 80, g, l, 6, to, 8, g, dl, in, those, with, coronary, artery, disease, who, are, not, actively, bleeding, transfusions, are, only, recommended, when, the, hemoglobin, is, below, 70, to, 80g, l, 7, to, 8, g, dl, transfusing, earlier, does, not, improve, survival, transfusions, otherwise, should, only, be, undertaken, in, cases, of, cardiovascular, instability, a, 2012, review, concluded, that, when, considering, blood, transfusions, for, anaemia, in, people, with, advanced, cancer, who, have, fatigue, and, breathlessness, not, related, to, cancer, treatment, or, haemorrhage, consideration, should, be, given, to, whether, there, are, alternative, strategies, can, be, tried, before, a, blood, transfusion, in, many, cases, vitamin, b, 12, is, used, by, intramuscular, injection, in, severe, cases, or, cases, of, malabsorption, of, dietary, b, 12, pernicious, anemia, caused, by, loss, of, intrinsic, factor, cannot, be, prevented, if, there, are, other, reversible, causes, of, low, vitamin, b, 12, levels, the, cause, must, be, treated, vitamin, b, 12, deficiency, anemia, is, usually, easily, treated, by, providing, the, necessary, level, of, vitamin, b, 12, supplementation, the, injections, are, quick, acting, and, symptoms, usually, go, away, within, one, to, two, weeks, as, the, condition, improves, doses, are, reduced, to, weeks, and, then, can, be, given, monthly, intramuscular, therapy, leads, to, more, rapid, improvement, and, should, be, considered, in, patients, with, severe, deficiency, or, severe, neurologic, symptoms, treatment, should, begin, rapidly, for, severe, neurological, symptoms, as, some, changes, can, become, permanent, in, some, individuals, lifelong, treatment, may, be, needed, the, objective, for, the, administration, of, an, erythropoiesis, stimulating, agent, esa, is, to, maintain, hemoglobin, at, the, lowest, level, that, both, minimizes, transfusions, and, meets, the, individual, person, s, needs, they, should, not, be, used, for, mild, or, moderate, anemia, they, are, not, recommended, in, people, with, chronic, kidney, disease, unless, hemoglobin, levels, are, less, than, 10, g, dl, or, they, have, symptoms, of, anemia, their, use, should, be,
