see, text, the, sticklebacks, are, a, family, of, ray, finned, fishes, the, gasterosteidae, which, have, a, holarctic, distribution, in, fresh, brackish, and, marine, waters, they, were, thought, to, be, related, to, the, pipefish, and, seahorses, but, are, now, thought, to, be, more, closely, related, to, the, eelpouts, and, sculpins, the, stickleback, family, gasterosteidae, was, first, proposed, as, a, family, by, the, french, zoologist, charles, lucien, bonaparte, in, 1831, it, was, long, thought, that, the, sticklebacks, and, their, relatives, made, up, a, suborder, the, gasterosteoidei, of, the, order, gasterostiformes, with, the, sea, horses, and, pipefishes, making, up, the, suborder, syngnathoidei, more, recent, phylogenetic, work, has, shown, that, the, gaterosteoidei, is, more, closely, related, to, the, zoarcoidei, and, the, cottoidei, which, means, that, this, taxon, would, belong, in, the, order, scorpaeniformes, but, in, other, phylogenetic, classifications, it, is, treated, as, the, infraorder, gasterosteales, within, the, suborder, cottoidei, or, as, a, sister, clade, to, the, zoarcales, in, the, order, zoarciformes, fishbase, recognises, 16, species, in, the, family, grouped, in, five, genera, however, several, of, the, species, have, a, number, of, recognised, subspecies, and, the, taxonomy, of, the, family, is, thought, to, be, in, need, of, revision, the, family, gasterosteidae, includes, the, following, genera, sticklebacks, are, endemic, to, the, temperate, zone, and, are, most, commonly, found, in, the, ocean, but, some, can, be, found, in, fresh, water, the, freshwater, taxa, were, trapped, in, europe, asia, and, north, america, after, the, ice, age, 10, 000, 20, 000, years, ago, and, have, evolved, features, different, from, those, of, the, marine, species, sticklebacks, are, carnivorous, feeding, on, small, animals, such, as, insects, crustaceans, and, fish, larvae, sticklebacks, are, characterised, by, the, presence, of, strong, and, clearly, isolated, spines, in, their, dorsal, fins, an, unusual, feature, of, sticklebacks, is, that, they, have, no, scales, although, some, species, have, bony, armour, plates, the, maximum, size, of, the, best, known, species, the, three, spined, stickleback, gasterosteus, aculeatus, is, about, 4, inches, but, few, of, them, are, more, than, 3, inches, long, they, mature, sexually, at, a, length, of, about, 2, inches, most, other, stickleback, species, are, roughly, similar, in, size, or, somewhat, smaller, the, only, exception, is, the, far, larger, fifteen, spined, stickleback, spinachia, spinachia, which, can, reach, 22, cm, approx, 8, 8, inches, body, form, varies, with, habitat, sticklebacks, in, shallow, lakes, have, developed, a, deep, body, specialized, to, enable, feeding, on, benthic, invertebrates, whilst, those, in, deep, oligotrophic, lakes, have, adapted, to, feed, on, plankton, and, have, a, more, slimlined, body, research, has, shown, that, sticklebacks, display, distinct, personality, traits, specifically, in, the, area, of, taking, a, risk, and, can, be, considered, bold, or, shy, these, personality, traits, were, determined, to, directly, influence, if, they, would, lead, and, if, discouraged, attempt, to, lead, again, all, stickleback, species, show, similar, unusual, mating, behaviour, freshwater, males, develop, a, red, colouration, and, although, this, may, be, seen, in, oceanic, and, benthic, species, these, tend, to, remain, dull, coloured, the, male, then, constructs, a, nest, from, weeds, held, together, by, spiggin, a, kidney, secretion, then, attract, females, to, the, nest, females, signal, their, readiness, to, mate, with, solitary, rather, than, shoaling, behaviour, a, head, up, posture, their, bellies, are, also, obviously, distended, with, eggs, courtship, typically, involves, a, zig, zag, dance, where, the, male, approaches, the, female, in, an, erratic, side, to, side, pattern, and, dorsal, pricking, of, the, female, s, abdomen, a, female, lays, her, eggs, inside, the, nest, where, the, male, fertilises, them, the, male, then, guards, the, eggs, until, they, hatch, 7, 14, days, later, depending, on, temperature, and, may, continue, to, guard, the, fry, after, they, hatch, this, large, investment, in, both, the, nesting, site, and, guarding, of, the, eggs, limits, the, number, of, females, a, male, can, mate, with, however, males, spawn, multiple, times, this, introduces, the, ability, for, selection, to, favor, male, mate, choice, some, males, die, following, spawning, typically, the, sex, with, the, greatest, parental, investment, has, the, strongest, mate, preferences, stickleback, species, exhibit, mutual, mate, choice, in, which, both, the, male, and, female, have, strong, mate, preferences, this, is, due, in, part, to, the, strong, parental, investment, on, behalf, of, the, male, in, guarding, the, eggs, female, sticklebacks, show, a, strong, preference, to, male, stickleback, with, bright, red, coloration, under, their, throats, females, mate, both, more, often, with, males, with, brighter, red, coloration, and, give, on, average, larger, eggs, to, be, fertilized, by, these, males, this, preference, has, led, to, brighter, red, coloring, this, association, is, possible, because, the, red, coloration, can, only, be, produced, by, males, that, are, free, of, parasites, this, is, referred, to, in, the, hamilton, zuk, hypothesis, however, there, is, also, evidence, that, attractive, male, red, coloration, may, be, a, faulty, signal, of, male, quality, male, sticklebacks, that, are, more, attractive, to, females, due, to, carotenoid, colorants, may, under, allocate, carotenoids, to, their, germline, cells, since, carotinoids, are, beneficial, antioxidants, their, under, allocation, to, germline, cells, can, lead, to, increased, oxidative, dna, damage, to, these, cells, therefore, female, sticklebacks, may, risk, fertility, and, the, viability, of, their, offspring, by, choosing, redder, but, more, deteriorated, partners, with, reduced, sperm, quality, female, mate, choice, has, also, been, seen, to, be, condition, dependent, females, are, almost, always, the, more, choosy, sex, in, most, species, female, sticklebacks, though, have, been, found, to, be, less, choosy, of, mates, when, in, poor, physical, condition, and, inversely, more, choosy, in, good, condition, in, some, species, such, as, the, three, spined, stickleback, the, large, investment, in, both, nesting, site, and, guarding, of, eggs, by, males, limits, the, number, of, females, a, male, can, mate, with, this, introduces, the, ability, for, selection, to, favor, male, mate, choice, male, mate, choice, is, rarely, studied, or, observed, in, many, species, but, multiple, studies, have, confirmed, male, mate, choice, within, stickleback, species, males, show, a, choosiness, similar, to, females, as, to, what, female, they, are, willing, to, court, and, mate, male, sticklebacks, have, been, observed, to, show, preference, towards, female, sticklebacks, that, are, larger, and, longer, this, is, believed, to, be, because, larger, females, on, average, produce, larger, eggs, which, leads, to, a, greater, offspring, survival, and, fitness, in, addition, male, sticklebacks, have, also, been, observed, to, prefer, females, with, more, distended, or, bloated, stomachs, the, benefits, of, this, is, also, due, to, larger, eggs, and, thus, offspring, survival, and, fitness, female, three, spined, sticklebacks, adjust, their, courting, behaviour, to, the, risk, of, inbreeding, when, gravid, females, are, given, the, choice, between, a, courting, unfamiliar, non, sibling, and, a, familiar, brother, they, prefer, to, mate, with, the, non, sibling, and, thus, avoid, the, disadvantages, that, accompany, incest, eggs, from, inbred, matings, compared, to, eggs, from, outbred, matings, have, a, lower, rate, of, fertilization, and, hatching, and, fewer, progeny, survive, to, reproductive, age, niko, tinbergen, s, studies, of, the, behaviour, of, this, fish, were, important, in, the, early, development, of, ethology, as, an, example, of, a, fixed, action, pattern, more, recently, the, fish, have, become, a, favourite, system, for, studying, the, molecular, genetics, of, evolutionary, change, in, wild, populations, and, a, powerful, supermodel, for, combining, evolutionary, studies, at, molecular, developmental, population, genetic, and, ecological, levels, the, nearly, complete, genome, sequence, of, a, reference, freshwater, stickleback, was, described, in, 2012, along, with, set, of, genetic, variants, commonly, found, in, 21, marine, and, freshwater, populations, around, the, world, some, variants, and, several, chromosome, inversions, consistently, distinguish, marine, and, freshwater, populations, helping, identify, a, genome, wide, set, of, changes, contributing, to, repeated, adaptation, of, sticklebacks, to, marine, and, freshwater, environments, the, adaptations, seen, in, oceanic, threespine, sticklebacks, make, them, an, ideal, organism, for, the, study, of, parallel, evolution, there, is, a, sculpture, in, kronstadt, dedicated, to, stickleback, which, saved, thousands, of, city, residents, from, starvation, during, the, leningrad, siege, of, world, war, ii
