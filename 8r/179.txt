glucose, is, a, sugar, with, the, molecular, formula, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, glucose, is, overall, the, most, abundant, monosaccharide, a, subcategory, of, carbohydrates, glucose, is, mainly, made, by, plants, and, most, algae, during, photosynthesis, from, water, and, carbon, dioxide, using, energy, from, sunlight, glucose, is, used, by, plants, to, make, cellulose, the, most, abundant, carbohydrate, in, the, world, for, use, in, cell, walls, and, by, all, living, organisms, to, make, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, which, is, used, by, the, cell, as, energy, in, energy, metabolism, glucose, is, the, most, important, source, of, energy, in, all, organisms, glucose, for, metabolism, is, stored, as, a, polymer, in, plants, mainly, as, amylose, and, amylopectin, and, in, animals, as, glycogen, glucose, circulates, in, the, blood, of, animals, as, blood, sugar, the, naturally, occurring, form, of, glucose, is, d, glucose, while, its, stereoisomer, l, glucose, is, produced, synthetically, in, comparatively, small, amounts, and, is, less, biologically, active, glucose, is, a, monosaccharide, containing, six, carbon, atoms, and, an, aldehyde, group, and, is, therefore, an, aldohexose, the, glucose, molecule, can, exist, in, an, open, chain, acyclic, as, well, as, ring, cyclic, form, glucose, is, naturally, occurring, and, is, found, in, its, free, state, in, fruits, and, other, parts, of, plants, in, animals, glucose, is, released, from, the, breakdown, of, glycogen, in, a, process, known, as, glycogenolysis, glucose, as, intravenous, sugar, solution, is, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, it, is, also, on, the, list, in, combination, with, sodium, chloride, table, salt, the, name, glucose, is, derived, from, ancient, greek, gle, kos, wine, must, from, glyk, s, sweet, the, suffix, ose, is, a, chemical, classifier, denoting, a, sugar, glucose, was, first, isolated, from, raisins, in, 1747, by, the, german, chemist, andreas, marggraf, glucose, was, discovered, in, grapes, by, another, german, chemist, johann, tobias, lowitz, in, 1792, and, distinguished, as, being, different, from, cane, sugar, sucrose, glucose, is, the, term, coined, by, jean, baptiste, dumas, in, 1838, which, has, prevailed, in, the, chemical, literature, friedrich, august, kekul, proposed, the, term, dextrose, from, the, latin, dexter, meaning, right, because, in, aqueous, solution, of, glucose, the, plane, of, linearly, polarized, light, is, turned, to, the, right, in, contrast, l, fructose, usually, referred, to, as, d, fructose, a, ketohexose, and, l, glucose, l, glucose, turn, linearly, polarized, light, to, the, left, the, earlier, notation, according, to, the, rotation, of, the, plane, of, linearly, polarized, light, d, and, l, nomenclature, was, later, abandoned, in, favor, of, the, d, and, l, notation, which, refers, to, the, absolute, configuration, of, the, asymmetric, center, farthest, from, the, carbonyl, group, and, in, concordance, with, the, configuration, of, d, or, l, glyceraldehyde, since, glucose, is, a, basic, necessity, of, many, organisms, a, correct, understanding, of, its, chemical, makeup, and, structure, contributed, greatly, to, a, general, advancement, in, organic, chemistry, this, understanding, occurred, largely, as, a, result, of, the, investigations, of, emil, fischer, a, german, chemist, who, received, the, 1902, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, findings, the, synthesis, of, glucose, established, the, structure, of, organic, material, and, consequently, formed, the, first, definitive, validation, of, jacobus, henricus, van, t, hoff, s, theories, of, chemical, kinetics, and, the, arrangements, of, chemical, bonds, in, carbon, bearing, molecules, between, 1891, and, 1894, fischer, established, the, stereochemical, configuration, of, all, the, known, sugars, and, correctly, predicted, the, possible, isomers, applying, van, t, hoff, s, theory, of, asymmetrical, carbon, atoms, the, names, initially, referred, to, the, natural, substances, their, enantiomers, were, given, the, same, name, with, the, introduction, of, systematic, nomenclatures, taking, into, account, absolute, stereochemistry, e, g, fischer, nomenclature, d, l, nomenclature, for, the, discovery, of, the, metabolism, of, glucose, otto, meyerhof, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1922, hans, von, euler, chelpin, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, along, with, arthur, harden, in, 1929, for, their, research, on, the, fermentation, of, sugar, and, their, share, of, enzymes, in, this, process, in, 1947, bernardo, houssay, for, his, discovery, of, the, role, of, the, pituitary, gland, in, the, metabolism, of, glucose, and, the, derived, carbohydrates, as, well, as, carl, and, gerty, cori, for, their, discovery, of, the, conversion, of, glycogen, from, glucose, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1970, luis, leloir, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, the, discovery, of, glucose, derived, sugar, nucleotides, in, the, biosynthesis, of, carbohydrates, glucose, forms, white, or, colorless, solids, that, are, highly, soluble, in, water, and, acetic, acid, but, poorly, soluble, in, methanol, and, ethanol, they, melt, at, 146, c, 295, f, and, 150, c, 302, f, beta, decompose, starting, at, 188, c, 370, f, with, release, of, various, volatile, products, ultimately, leaving, a, residue, of, carbon, glucose, has, a, pka, value, of, 12, 16, at, 25, c, 77, f, in, water, with, six, carbon, atoms, it, is, classed, as, a, hexose, a, subcategory, of, the, monosaccharides, d, glucose, is, one, of, the, sixteen, aldohexose, stereoisomers, the, d, isomer, d, glucose, also, known, as, dextrose, occurs, widely, in, nature, but, the, l, isomer, l, glucose, does, not, glucose, can, be, obtained, by, hydrolysis, of, carbohydrates, such, as, milk, sugar, lactose, cane, sugar, sucrose, maltose, cellulose, glycogen, etc, dextrose, is, commonly, commercially, manufactured, from, starches, such, as, corn, starch, in, the, us, and, japan, from, potato, and, wheat, starch, in, europe, and, from, tapioca, starch, in, tropical, areas, the, manufacturing, process, uses, hydrolysis, via, pressurized, steaming, at, controlled, ph, in, a, jet, followed, by, further, enzymatic, depolymerization, unbonded, glucose, is, one, of, the, main, ingredients, of, honey, the, term, dextrose, is, often, used, in, a, clinical, related, to, patient, s, health, status, or, nutritional, context, related, to, dietary, intake, such, as, food, labels, or, dietary, guidelines, while, glucose, is, used, in, a, biological, or, physiological, context, chemical, processes, and, molecular, interactions, but, both, terms, refer, to, the, same, molecule, specifically, d, glucose, dextrose, monohydrate, is, the, hydrated, form, of, d, glucose, meaning, that, it, is, a, glucose, molecule, with, an, additional, water, molecule, attached, its, chemical, formula, is, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, h, 2, o, dextrose, monohydrate, is, also, called, hydrated, d, glucose, and, commonly, manufactured, from, plant, starches, dextrose, monohydrate, is, utilized, as, the, predominant, type, of, dextrose, in, food, applications, such, as, beverage, mixes, it, is, a, common, form, of, glucose, widely, used, as, a, nutrition, supplement, in, production, of, foodstuffs, dextrose, monohydrate, is, primarily, consumed, in, north, america, as, a, corn, syrup, or, high, fructose, corn, syrup, anhydrous, dextrose, on, the, other, hand, is, glucose, that, does, not, have, any, water, molecules, attached, to, it, anhydrous, chemical, substances, are, commonly, produced, by, eliminating, water, from, a, hydrated, substance, through, methods, such, as, heating, or, drying, up, desiccation, dextrose, monohydrate, can, be, dehydrated, to, anhydrous, dextrose, in, industrial, setting, dextrose, monohydrate, is, composed, of, approximately, 9, 5, water, by, mass, through, the, process, of, dehydration, this, water, content, is, eliminated, to, yield, anhydrous, dry, dextrose, anhydrous, dextrose, has, the, chemical, formula, c, 6, h, 12, o, 6, without, any, water, molecule, attached, which, is, the, same, as, glucose, anhydrous, dextrose, on, open, air, tends, to, absorb, moisture, and, transform, to, the, monohydrate, and, it, is, more, expensive, to, produce, anhydrous, dextrose, anhydrous, d, glucose, has, increased, stability, and, increased, shelf, life, has, medical, applications, such, as, in, oral, glucose, tolerance, test, whereas, molecular, weight, molar, mass, for, d, glucose, monohydrate, is, 198, 17, g, mol, that, for, anhydrous, d, glucose, is, 180, 16, g, mol, the, density, of, these, two, forms, of, glucose, is, also, different, in, terms, of, chemical, structure, glucose, is, a, monosaccharide, that, is, a, simple, sugar, glucose, contains, six, carbon, atoms, and, an, aldehyde, group, and, is, therefore, an, aldohexose, the, glucose, molecule, can, exist, in, an, open, chain, acyclic, as, well, as, ring, cyclic, form, due, to, the, presence, of, alcohol, and, aldehyde, or, ketone, functional, groups, the, form, having, the, straight, chain, can, easily, convert, into, a, chair, like, hemiacetal, ring, structure, commonly, found, in, carbohydrates, glucose, is, present, in, solid, form, as, a, monohydrate, with, a, closed, pyran, ring, glucopyranose, monohydrate, sometimes, known, less, precisely, by, dextrose, hydrate, in, aqueous, solution, on, the, other, hand, it, is, an, open, chain, to, a, small, extent, and, is, present, predominantly, as, or, pyranose, which, interconvert, from, aqueous, solutions, the, three, known, forms, can, be, crystallized, glucopyranose, glucopyranose, and, glucopyranose, monohydrate, glucose, is, a, building, block, of, the, disaccharides, lactose, and, sucrose, cane, or, beet, sugar, of, oligosaccharides, such, as, raffinose, and, of, polysaccharides, such, as, starch, amylopectin, glycogen, and, cellulose, the, glass, transition, temperature, of, glucose, is, 31, c, 88, f, and, the, gordon, taylor, constant, an, experimentally, determined, constant, for, the, prediction, of, the, glass, transition, temperature, for, different, mass, fractions, of, a, mixture, of, two, substances, is, 4, 5, a, open, chain, form, of, glucose, makes, up, less, than, 0, 02, of, the, glucose, molecules, in, an, aqueous, solution, at, equilibrium, the, rest, is, one, of, two, cyclic, hemiacetal, forms, in, its, open, chain, form, the, glucose, molecule, has, an, open, as, opposed, to, cyclic, unbranched, backbone, of, six, carbon, atoms, where, c, 1, is, part, of, an, aldehyde, group, h, c, o, therefore, glucose, is, also, classified, as, an, aldose, or, an, aldohexose, the, aldehyde, group, makes, glucose, a, reducing, sugar, giving, a, positive, reaction, with, the, fehling, test, in, solutions, the, open, chain, form, of, glucose, either, d, or, l, exists, in, equilibrium, with, several, cyclic, isomers, each, containing, a, ring, of, carbons, closed, by, one, oxygen, atom, in, aqueous, solution, however, more, than, 99, of, glucose, molecules, exist, as, pyranose, forms, the, open, chain, form, is, limited, to, about, 0, 25, and, furanose, forms, exist, in, negligible, amounts, the, terms, glucose, and, d, glucose, are, generally, used, for, these, cyclic, forms, as, well, the, ring, arises, from, the, open, chain, form, by, an, intramolecular, nucleophilic, addition, reaction, between, the, aldehyde, group, at, c, 1, and, either, the, c, 4, or, c, 5, hydroxyl, group, forming, a, hemiacetal, linkage, c, oh, h, o, the, reaction, between, c, 1, and, c, 5, yields, a, six, membered, heterocyclic, system, called, a, pyranose, which, is, a, monosaccharide, sugar, hence, ose, containing, a, derivatised, pyran, skeleton, the, much, rarer, reaction, between, c, 1, and, c, 4, yields, a, five, membered, furanose, ring, named, after, the, cyclic, ether, furan, in, either, case, each, carbon, in, the, ring, has, one, hydrogen, and, one, hydroxyl, attached, except, for, the, last, carbon, c, 4, or, c, 5, where, the, hydroxyl, is, replaced, by, the, remainder, of, the, open, molecule, which, is, c, ch, 2, oh, hoh, h, or, choh, h, respectively, the, ring, closing, reaction, can, give, two, products, denoted, and, when, a, glucopyranose, molecule, is, drawn, in, the, haworth, projection, the, designation, means, that, the, hydroxyl, group, attached, to, c, 1, and, the, ch, 2, oh, group, at, c, 5, lies, on, opposite, sides, of, the, ring, s, plane, a, trans, arrangement, while, means, that, they, are, on, the, same, side, of, the, plane, a, cis, arrangement, therefore, the, open, chain, isomer, d, glucose, gives, rise, to, four, distinct, cyclic, isomers, d, glucopyranose, d, glucopyranose, d, glucofuranose, and, d, glucofuranose, these, five, structures, exist, in, equilibrium, and, interconvert, and, the, interconversion, is, much, more, rapid, with, acid, catalysis, the, other, open, chain, isomer, l, glucose, similarly, gives, rise, to, four, distinct, cyclic, forms, of, l, glucose, each, the, mirror, image, of, the, corresponding, d, glucose, the, glucopyranose, ring, or, can, assume, several, non, planar, shapes, analogous, to, the, chair, and, boat, conformations, of, cyclohexane, similarly, the, glucofuranose, ring, may, assume, several, shapes, analogous, to, the, envelope, conformations, of, cyclopentane, in, the, solid, state, only, the, glucopyranose, forms, are, observed, some, derivatives, of, glucofuranose, such, as, 1, 2, o, isopropylidene, d, glucofuranose, are, stable, and, can, be, obtained, pure, as, crystalline, solids, for, example, reaction, of, d, glucose, with, para, tolylboronic, acid, h, 3, c, c, 6, h, 4, b, oh, 2, reforms, the, normal, pyranose, ring, to, yield, the, 4, fold, ester, d, glucofuranose, 1, 2, 3, 5, bis, p, tolylboronate, mutarotation, consists, of, a, temporary, reversal, of, the, ring, forming, reaction, resulting, in, the, open, chain, form, followed, by, a, reforming, of, the, ring, the, ring, closure, step, may, use, a, different, oh, group, than, the, one, recreated, by, the, opening, step, thus, switching, between, pyranose, and, furanose, forms, or, the, new, hemiacetal, group, created, on, c, 1, may, have, the, same, or, opposite, handedness, as, the, original, one, thus, switching, between, the, and, forms, thus, though, the, open, chain, form, is, barely, detectable, in, solution, it, is, an, essential, component, of, the, equilibrium, the, open, chain, form, is, thermodynamically, unstable, and, it, spontaneously, isomerizes, to, the, cyclic, forms, although, the, ring, closure, reaction, could, in, theory, create, four, or, three, atom, rings, these, would, be, highly, strained, and, are, not, observed, in, practice, in, solutions, at, room, temperature, the, four, cyclic, isomers, interconvert, over, a, time, scale, of, hours, in, a, process, called, mutarotation, starting, from, any, proportions, the, mixture, converges, to, a, stable, ratio, of, 36, 64, the, ratio, would, be, 11, 89, if, it, were, not, for, the, influence, of, the, anomeric, effect, mutarotation, is, considerably, slower, at, temperatures, close, to, 0, c, 32, f, whether, in, water, or, the, solid, form, d, glucose, is, dextrorotatory, meaning, it, will, rotate, the, direction, of, polarized, light, clockwise, as, seen, looking, toward, the, light, source, the, effect, is, due, to, the, chirality, of, the, molecules, and, indeed, the, mirror, image, isomer, l, glucose, is, levorotatory, rotates, polarized, light, counterclockwise, by, the, same, amount, the, strength, of, the, effect, is, different, for, each, of, the, five, tautomers, the, d, prefix, does, not, refer, directly, to, the, optical, properties, of, the, compound, it, indicates, that, the, c, 5, chiral, centre, has, the, same, handedness, as, that, of, d, glyceraldehyde, which, was, so, labelled, because, it, is, dextrorotatory, the, fact, that, d, glucose, is, dextrorotatory, is, a, combined, effect, of, its, four, chiral, centres, not, just, of, c, 5, some, of, the, other, d, aldohexoses, are, levorotatory, the, conversion, between, the, two, anomers, can, be, observed, in, a, polarimeter, since, pure, d, glucose, has, a, specific, rotation, angle, of, 112, 2, ml, dm, g, pure, d, glucose, of, 17, 5, ml, dm, g, when, equilibrium, has, been, reached, after, a, certain, time, due, to, mutarotation, the, angle, of, rotation, is, 52, 7, ml, dm, g, by, adding, acid, or, base, this, transformation, is, much, accelerated, the, equilibration, takes, place, via, the, open, chain, aldehyde, form, in, dilute, sodium, hydroxide, or, other, dilute, bases, the, monosaccharides, mannose, glucose, and, fructose, interconvert, via, a, lobry, de, bruyn, alberda, van, ekenstein, transformation, so, that, a, balance, between, these, isomers, is, formed, this, reaction, proceeds, via, an, enediol, glucose, is, the, most, abundant, monosaccharide, glucose, is, also, the, most, widely, used, aldohexose, in, most, living, organisms, one, possible, explanation, for, this, is, that, glucose, has, a, lower, tendency, than, other, aldohexoses, to, react, nonspecifically, with, the, amine, groups, of, proteins, this, reaction, glycation, impairs, or, destroys, the, function, of, many, proteins, e, g, in, glycated, hemoglobin, glucose, s, low, rate, of, glycation, can, be, attributed, to, its, having, a, more, stable, cyclic, form, compared, to, other, aldohexoses, which, means, it, spends, less, time, than, they, do, in, its, reactive, open, chain, form, the, reason, for, glucose, having, the, most, stable, cyclic, form, of, all, the, aldohexoses, is, that, its, hydroxy, groups, with, the, exception, of, the, hydroxy, group, on, the, anomeric, carbon, of, d, glucose, are, in, the, equatorial, position, presumably, glucose, is, the, most, abundant, natural, monosaccharide, because, it, is, less, glycated, with, proteins, than, other, monosaccharides, another, hypothesis, is, that, glucose, being, the, only, d, aldohexose, that, has, all, five, hydroxy, substituents, in, the, equatorial, position, in, the, form, of, d, glucose, is, more, readily, accessible, to, chemical, reactions, 194, 199, for, example, for, esterification, 363, or, acetal, formation, for, this, reason, d, glucose, is, also, a, highly, preferred, building, block, in, natural, polysaccharides, glycans, polysaccharides, that, are, composed, solely, of, glucose, are, termed, glucans, glucose, is, produced, by, plants, through, photosynthesis, using, sunlight, water, and, carbon, dioxide, and, can, be, used, by, all, living, organisms, as, an, energy, and, carbon, source, however, most, glucose, does, not, occur, in, its, free, form, but, in, the, form, of, its, polymers, i, e, lactose, sucrose, starch, and, others, which, are, energy, reserve, substances, and, cellulose, and, chitin, which, are, components, of, the, cell, wall, in, plants, or, fungi, and, arthropods, respectively, these, polymers, when, consumed, by, animals, fungi, and, bacteria, are, degraded, to, glucose, using, enzymes, all, animals, are, also, able, to, produce, glucose, themselves, from, certain, precursors, as, the, need, arises, neurons, cells, of, the, renal, medulla, and, erythrocytes, depend, on, glucose, for, their, energy, production, in, adult, humans, there, is, about, 18, g, 0, 63, oz, of, glucose, of, which, about, 4, g, 0, 14, oz, is, present, in, the, blood, approximately, 180, 220, g, 6, 3, 7, 8, oz, of, glucose, is, produced, in, the, liver, of, an, adult, in, 24, hours, many, of, the, long, term, complications, of, diabetes, e, g, blindness, kidney, failure, and, peripheral, neuropathy, are, probably, due, to, the, glycation, of, proteins, or, lipids, in, contrast, enzyme, regulated, addition, of, sugars, to, protein, is, called, glycosylation, and, is, essential, for, the, function, of, many, proteins, ingested, glucose, initially, binds, to, the, receptor, for, sweet, taste, on, the, tongue, in, humans, this, complex, of, the, proteins, t1r2, and, t1r3, makes, it, possible, to, identify, glucose, containing, food, sources, glucose, mainly, comes, from, food, about, 300, g, 11, oz, per, day, is, produced, by, conversion, of, food, but, it, is, also, synthesized, from, other, metabolites, in, the, body, s, cells, in, humans, the, breakdown, of, glucose, containing, polysaccharides, happens, in, part, already, during, chewing, by, means, of, amylase, which, is, contained, in, saliva, as, well, as, by, maltase, lactase, and, sucrase, on, the, brush, border, of, the, small, intestine, glucose, is, a, building, block, of, many, carbohydrates, and, can, be, split, off, from, them, using, certain, enzymes, glucosidases, a, subgroup, of, the, glycosidases, first, catalyze, the, hydrolysis, of, long, chain, glucose, containing, polysaccharides, removing, terminal, glucose, in, turn, disaccharides, are, mostly, degraded, by, specific, glycosidases, to, glucose, the, names, of, the, degrading, enzymes, are, often, derived, from, the, particular, poly, and, disaccharide, inter, alia, for, the, degradation, of, polysaccharide, chains, there, are, amylases, named, after, amylose, a, component, of, starch, cellulases, named, after, cellulose, chitinases, named, after, chitin, and, more, furthermore, for, the, cleavage, of, disaccharides, there, are, maltase, lactase, sucrase, trehalase, and, others, in, humans, about, 70, genes, are, known, that, code, for, glycosidases, they, have, functions, in, the, digestion, and, degradation, of, glycogen, sphingolipids, mucopolysaccharides, and, poly, adp, ribose, humans, do, not, produce, cellulases, chitinases, or, trehalases, but, the, bacteria, in, the, gut, microbiota, do, in, order, to, get, into, or, out, of, cell, membranes, of, cells, and, membranes, of, cell, compartments, glucose, requires, special, transport, proteins, from, the, major, facilitator, superfamily, in, the, small, intestine, more, precisely, in, the, jejunum, glucose, is, taken, up, into, the, intestinal, epithelium, with, the, help, of, glucose, transporters, via, a, secondary, active, transport, mechanism, called, sodium, ion, glucose, symport, via, sodium, glucose, cotransporter, 1, sglt1, further, transfer, occurs, on, the, basolateral, side, of, the, intestinal, epithelial, cells, via, the, glucose, transporter, glut2, as, well, uptake, into, liver, cells, kidney, cells, cells, of, the, islets, of, langerhans, neurons, astrocytes, and, tanycytes, glucose, enters, the, liver, via, the, portal, vein, and, is, stored, there, as, a, cellular, glycogen, in, the, liver, cell, it, is, phosphorylated, by, glucokinase, at, position, 6, to, form, glucose, 6, phosphate, which, cannot, leave, the, cell, glucose, 6, phosphatase, can, convert, glucose, 6, phosphate, back, into, glucose, exclusively, in, the, liver, so, the, body, can, maintain, a, sufficient, blood, glucose, concentration, in, other, cells, uptake, happens, by, passive, transport, through, one, of, the, 14, glut, proteins, in, the, other, cell, types, phosphorylation, occurs, through, a, hexokinase, whereupon, glucose, can, no, longer, diffuse, out, of, the, cell, the, glucose, transporter, glut1, is, produced, by, most, cell, types, and, is, of, particular, importance, for, nerve, cells, and, pancreatic, cells, glut3, is, highly, expressed, in, nerve, cells, glucose, from, the, bloodstream, is, taken, up, by, glut4, from, muscle, cells, of, the, skeletal, muscle, and, heart, muscle, and, fat, cells, glut14, is, expressed, exclusively, in, testicles, excess, glucose, is, broken, down, and, converted, into, fatty, acids, which, are, stored, as, triglycerides, in, the, kidneys, glucose, in, the, urine, is, absorbed, via, sglt1, and, sglt2, in, the, apical, cell, membranes, and, transmitted, via, glut2, in, the, basolateral, cell, membranes, about, 90, of, kidney, glucose, reabsorption, is, via, sglt2, and, about, 3, via, sglt1, in, plants, and, some, prokaryotes, glucose, is, a, product, of, photosynthesis, glucose, is, also, formed, by, the, breakdown, of, polymeric, forms, of, glucose, like, glycogen, in, animals, and, mushrooms, or, starch, in, plants, the, cleavage, of, glycogen, is, termed, glycogenolysis, the, cleavage, of, starch, is, called, starch, degradation, the, metabolic, pathway, that, begins, with, molecules, containing, two, to, four, carbon, atoms, c, and, ends, in, the, glucose, molecule, containing, six, carbon, atoms, is, called, gluconeogenesis, and, occurs, in, all, living, organisms, the, smaller, starting, materials, are, the, result, of, other, metabolic, pathways, ultimately, almost, all, biomolecules, come, from, the, assimilation, of, carbon, dioxide, in, plants, and, microbes, during, photosynthesis, 359, the, free, energy, of, formation, of, d, glucose, is, 917, 2, kilojoules, per, mole, 59, in, humans, gluconeogenesis, occurs, in, the, liver, and, kidney, but, also, in, other, cell, types, in, the, liver, about, 150, g, 5, 3, oz, of, glycogen, are, stored, in, skeletal, muscle, about, 250, g, 8, 8, oz, however, the, glucose, released, in, muscle, cells, upon, cleavage, of, the, glycogen, can, not, be, delivered, to, the, circulation, because, glucose, is, phosphorylated, by, the, hexokinase, and, a, glucose, 6, phosphatase, is, not, expressed, to, remove, the, phosphate, group, unlike, for, glucose, there, is, no, transport, protein, for, glucose, 6, phosphate, gluconeogenesis, allows, the, organism, to, build, up, glucose, from, other, metabolites, including, lactate, or, certain, amino, acids, while, consuming, energy, the, renal, tubular, cells, can, also, produce, glucose, glucose, also, can, be, found, outside, of, living, organisms, in, the, ambient, environment, glucose, concentrations, in, the, atmosphere, are, detected, via, collection, of, samples, by, aircraft, and, are, known, to, vary, from, location, to, location, for, example, glucose, concentrations, in, atmospheric, air, from, inland, china, range, from, 0, 8, to, 20, 1, pg, l, whereas, east, coastal, china, glucose, concentrations, range, from, 10, 3, to, 142, pg, l, in, humans, glucose, is, metabolized, by, glycolysis, and, the, pentose, phosphate, pathway, glycolysis, is, used, by, all, living, organisms, 551, with, small, variations, and, all, organisms, generate, energy, from, the, breakdown, of, monosaccharides, in, the, further, course, of, the, metabolism, it, can, be, completely, degraded, via, oxidative, decarboxylation, the, citric, acid, cycle, synonym, krebs, cycle, and, the, respiratory, chain, to, water, and, carbon, dioxide, if, there, is, not, enough, oxygen, available, for, this, the, glucose, degradation, in, animals, occurs, anaerobic, to, lactate, via, lactic, acid, fermentation, and, releases, much, less, energy, muscular, lactate, enters, the, liver, through, the, bloodstream, in, mammals, where, gluconeogenesis, occurs, cori, cycle, with, a, high, supply, of, glucose, the, metabolite, acetyl, coa, from, the, krebs, cycle, can, also, be, used, for, fatty, acid, synthesis, glucose, is, also, used, to, replenish, the, body, s, glycogen, stores, which, are, mainly, found, in, liver, and, skeletal, muscle, these, processes, are, hormonally, regulated, in, other, living, organisms, other, forms, of, fermentation, can, occur, the, bacterium, escherichia, coli, can, grow, on, nutrient, media, containing, glucose, as, the, sole, carbon, source, 59, in, some, bacteria, and, in, modified, form, also, in, archaea, glucose, is, degraded, via, the, entner, doudoroff, pathway, with, glucose, a, mechanism, for, gene, regulation, was, discovered, in, e, coli, the, catabolite, repression, formerly, known, as, glucose, effect, use, of, glucose, as, an, energy, source, in, cells, is, by, either, aerobic, respiration, anaerobic, respiration, or, fermentation, the, first, step, of, glycolysis, is, the, phosphorylation, of, glucose, by, a, hexokinase, to, form, glucose, 6, phosphate, the, main, reason, for, the, immediate, phosphorylation, of, glucose, is, to, prevent, its, diffusion, out, of, the, cell, as, the, charged, phosphate, group, prevents, glucose, 6, phosphate, from, easily, crossing, the, cell, membrane, furthermore, addition, of, the, high, energy, phosphate, group, activates, glucose, for, subsequent, breakdown, in, later, steps, of, glycolysis, in, anaerobic, respiration, one, glucose, molecule, produces, a, net, gain, of, two, atp, molecules, four, atp, molecules, are, produced, during, glycolysis, through, substrate, level, phosphorylation, but, two, are, required, by, enzymes, used, during, the, process, in, aerobic, respiration, a, molecule, of, glucose, is, much, more, profitable, in, that, a, maximum, net, production, of, 30, or, 32, atp, molecules, depending, on, the, organism, is, generated, click, on, genes, proteins, and, metabolites, below, to, link, to, respective, articles, tumor, cells, often, grow, comparatively, quickly, and, consume, an, above, average, amount, of, glucose, by, glycolysis, which, leads, to, the, formation, of, lactate, the, end, product, of, fermentation, in, mammals, even, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, this, is, called, the, warburg, effect, for, the, increased, uptake, of, glucose, in, tumors, various, sglt, and, glut, are, overly, produced, in, yeast, ethanol, is, fermented, at, high, glucose, concentrations, even, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, which, normally, leads, to, respiration, rather, than, fermentation, this, is, called, the, crabtree, effect, glucose, can, also, degrade, to, form, carbon, dioxide, through, abiotic, means, this, has, been, demonstrated, to, occur, experimentally, via, oxidation, and, hydrolysis, at, 22, c, and, a, ph, of, 2, 5, glucose, is, a, ubiquitous, fuel, in, biology, it, is, used, as, an, energy, source, in, organisms, from, bacteria, to, humans, through, either, aerobic, respiration, anaerobic, respiration, in, bacteria, or, fermentation, glucose, is, the, human, body, s, key, source, of, energy, through, aerobic, respiration, providing, about, 3, 75, kilocalories, 16, kilojoules, of, food, energy, per, gram, breakdown, of, carbohydrates, e, g, starch, yields, mono, and, disaccharides, most, of, which, is, glucose, through, glycolysis, and, later, in, the, reactions, of, the, citric, acid, cycle, and, oxidative, phosphorylation, glucose, is, oxidized, to, eventually, form, carbon, dioxide, and, water, yielding, energy, mostly, in, the, form, of, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, the, insulin, reaction, and, other, mechanisms, regulate, the, concentration, of, glucose, in, the, blood, the, physiological, caloric, value, of, glucose, depending, on, the, source, is, 16, 2, kilojoules, per, gram, or, 15, 7, kj, g, 3, 74, kcal, g, the, high, availability, of, carbohydrates, from, plant, biomass, has, led, to, a, variety, of, methods, during, evolution, especially, in, microorganisms, to, utilize, glucose, for, energy, and, carbon, storage, differences, exist, in, which, end, product, can, no, longer, be, used, for, energy, production, the, presence, of, individual, genes, and, their, gene, products, the, enzymes, determine, which, reactions, are, possible, the, metabolic, pathway, of, glycolysis, is, used, by, almost, all, living, beings, an, essential, difference, in, the, use, of, glycolysis, is, the, recovery, of, nadph, as, a, reductant, for, anabolism, that, would, otherwise, have, to, be, generated, indirectly, glucose, and, oxygen, supply, almost, all, the, energy, for, the, brain, so, its, availability, influences, psychological, processes, when, glucose, is, low, psychological, processes, requiring, mental, effort, e, g, self, control, effortful, decision, making, are, impaired, in, the, brain, which, is, dependent, on, glucose, and, oxygen, as, the, major, source, of, energy, the, glucose, concentration, is, usually, 4, to, 6, mm, 5, mm, equals, 90, mg, dl, but, decreases, to, 2, to, 3, mm, when, fasting, confusion, occurs, below, 1, mm, and, coma, at, lower, levels, the, glucose, in, the, blood, is, called, blood, sugar, blood, sugar, levels, are, regulated, by, glucose, binding, nerve, cells, in, the, hypothalamus, in, addition, glucose, in, the, brain, binds, to, glucose, receptors, of, the, reward, system, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, the, binding, of, glucose, to, the, sweet, receptor, on, the, tongue, induces, a, release, of, various, hormones, of, energy, metabolism, either, through, glucose, or, through, other, sugars, leading, to, an, increased, cellular, uptake, and, lower, blood, sugar, levels, artificial, sweeteners, do, not, lower, blood, sugar, levels, the, blood, sugar, content, of, a, healthy, person, in, the, short, time, fasting, state, e, g, after, overnight, fasting, is, about, 70, to, 100, mg, dl, of, blood, 4, to, 5, 5, mm, in, blood, plasma, the, measured, values, are, about, 10, 15, higher, in, addition, the, values, in, the, arterial, blood, are, higher, than, the, concentrations, in, the, venous, blood, since, glucose, is, absorbed, into, the, tissue, during, the, passage, of, the, capillary, bed, also, in, the, capillary, blood, which, is, often, used, for, blood, sugar, determination, the, values, are, sometimes, higher, than, in, the, venous, blood, the, glucose, content, of, the, blood, is, regulated, by, the, hormones, insulin, incretin, and, glucagon, insulin, lowers, the, glucose, level, glucagon, increases, it, furthermore, the, hormones, adrenaline, thyroxine, glucocorticoids, somatotropin, and, adrenocorticotropin, lead, to, an, increase, in, the, glucose, level, there, is, also, a, hormone, independent, regulation, which, is, referred, to, as, glucose, autoregulation, after, food, intake, the, blood, sugar, concentration, increases, values, over, 180, mg, dl, in, venous, whole, blood, are, pathological, and, are, termed, hyperglycemia, values, below, 40, mg, dl, are, termed, hypoglycaemia, when, needed, glucose, is, released, into, the, bloodstream, by, glucose, 6, phosphatase, from, glucose, 6, phosphate, originating, from, liver, and, kidney, glycogen, thereby, regulating, the, homeostasis, of, blood, glucose, concentration, in, ruminants, the, blood, glucose, concentration, is, lower, 60, mg, dl, in, cattle, and, 40, mg, dl, in, sheep, because, the, carbohydrates, are, converted, more, by, their, gut, microbiota, into, short, chain, fatty, acids, some, glucose, is, converted, to, lactic, acid, by, astrocytes, which, is, then, utilized, as, an, energy, source, by, brain, cells, some, glucose, is, used, by, intestinal, cells, and, red, blood, cells, while, the, rest, reaches, the, liver, adipose, tissue, and, muscle, cells, where, it, is, absorbed, and, stored, as, glycogen, under, the, influence, of, insulin, liver, cell, glycogen, can, be, converted, to, glucose, and, returned, to, the, blood, when, insulin, is, low, or, absent, muscle, cell, glycogen, is, not, returned, to, the, blood, because, of, a, lack, of, enzymes, in, fat, cells, glucose, is, used, to, power, reactions, that, synthesize, some, fat, types, and, have, other, purposes, glycogen, is, the, body, s, glucose, energy, storage, mechanism, because, it, is, much, more, space, efficient, and, less, reactive, than, glucose, itself, as, a, result, of, its, importance, in, human, health, glucose, is, an, analyte, in, glucose, tests, that, are, common, medical, blood, tests, eating, or, fasting, prior, to, taking, a, blood, sample, has, an, effect, on, analyses, for, glucose, in, the, blood, a, high, fasting, glucose, blood, sugar, level, may, be, a, sign, of, prediabetes, or, diabetes, mellitus, the, glycemic, index, is, an, indicator, of, the, speed, of, resorption, and, conversion, to, blood, glucose, levels, from, ingested, carbohydrates, measured, as, the, area, under, the, curve, of, blood, glucose, levels, after, consumption, in, comparison, to, glucose, glucose, is, defined, as, 100, the, clinical, importance, of, the, glycemic, index, is, controversial, as, foods, with, high, fat, contents, slow, the, resorption, of, carbohydrates, and, lower, the, glycemic, index, e, g, ice, cream, an, alternative, indicator, is, the, insulin, index, measured, as, the, impact, of, carbohydrate, consumption, on, the, blood, insulin, levels, the, glycemic, load, is, an, indicator, for, the, amount, of, glucose, added, to, blood, glucose, levels, after, consumption, based, on, the, glycemic, index, and, the, amount, of, consumed, food, organisms, use, glucose, as, a, precursor, for, the, synthesis, of, several, important, substances, starch, cellulose, and, glycogen, animal, starch, are, common, glucose, polymers, polysaccharides, some, of, these, polymers, starch, or, glycogen, serve, as, energy, stores, while, others, cellulose, and, chitin, which, is, made, from, a, derivative, of, glucose, have, structural, roles, oligosaccharides, of, glucose, combined, with, other, sugars, serve, as, important, energy, stores, these, include, lactose, the, predominant, sugar, in, milk, which, is, a, glucose, galactose, disaccharide, and, sucrose, another, disaccharide, which, is, composed, of, glucose, and, fructose, glucose, is, also, added, onto, certain, proteins, and, lipids, in, a, process, called, glycosylation, this, is, often, critical, for, their, functioning, the, enzymes, that, join, glucose, to, other, molecules, usually, use, phosphorylated, glucose, to, power, the, formation, of, the, new, bond, by, coupling, it, with, the, breaking, of, the, glucose, phosphate, bond, other, than, its, direct, use, as, a, monomer, glucose, can, be, broken, down, to, synthesize, a, wide, variety, of, other, biomolecules, this, is, important, as, glucose, serves, both, as, a, primary, store, of, energy, and, as, a, source, of, organic, carbon, glucose, can, be, broken, down, and, converted, into, lipids, it, is, also, a, precursor, for, the, synthesis, of, other, important, molecules, such, as, vitamin, c, ascorbic, acid, in, living, organisms, glucose, is, converted, to, several, other, chemical, compounds, that, are, the, starting, material, for, various, metabolic, pathways, among, them, all, other, monosaccharides, such, as, fructose, via, the, polyol, pathway, mannose, the, epimer, of, glucose, at, position, 2, galactose, the, epimer, at, position, 4, fucose, various, uronic, acids, and, the,

degradation, to, glucono, 1, 5, lactone, glucose, is, used, in, some, bacteria, as, a, building, block, in, the, trehalose, or, the, dextran, biosynthesis, and, in, animals, as, a, building, block, of, glycogen, glucose, can, also, be, converted, from, bacterial, xylose, isomerase, to, fructose, in, addition, glucose, metabolites, produce, all, nonessential, amino, acids, sugar, alcohols, such, as, mannitol, and, sorbitol, fatty, acids, cholesterol, and, nucleic, acids, finally, glucose, is, used, as, a, building, block, in, the, glycosylation, of, proteins, to, glycoproteins, glycolipids, peptidoglycans, glycosides, and, other, substances, catalyzed, by, glycosyltransferases, and, can, be, cleaved, from, them, by, glycosidases, diabetes, is, a, metabolic, disorder, where, the, body, is, unable, to, regulate, levels, of, glucose, in, the, blood, either, because, of, a, lack, of, insulin, in, the, body, or, the, failure, by, cells, in, the, body, to, respond, properly, to, insulin, each, of, these, situations, can, be, caused, by, persistently, high, elevations, of, blood, glucose, levels, through, pancreatic, burnout, and, insulin, resistance, the, pancreas, is, the, organ, responsible, for, the, secretion, of, the, hormones, insulin, and, glucagon, insulin, is, a, hormone, that, regulates, glucose, levels, allowing, the, body, s, cells, to, absorb, and, use, glucose, without, it, glucose, cannot, enter, the, cell, and, therefore, cannot, be, used, as, fuel, for, the, body, s, functions, if, the, pancreas, is, exposed, to, persistently, high, elevations, of, blood, glucose, levels, the, insulin, producing, cells, in, the, pancreas, could, be, damaged, causing, a, lack, of, insulin, in, the, body, insulin, resistance, occurs, when, the, pancreas, tries, to, produce, more, and, more, insulin, in, response, to, persistently, elevated, blood, glucose, levels, eventually, the, rest, of, the, body, becomes, resistant, to, the, insulin, that, the, pancreas, is, producing, thereby, requiring, more, insulin, to, achieve, the, same, blood, glucose, lowering, effect, and, forcing, the, pancreas, to, produce, even, more, insulin, to, compete, with, the, resistance, this, negative, spiral, contributes, to, pancreatic, burnout, and, the, disease, progression, of, diabetes, to, monitor, the, body, s, response, to, blood, glucose, lowering, therapy, glucose, levels, can, be, measured, blood, glucose, monitoring, can, be, performed, by, multiple, methods, such, as, the, fasting, glucose, test, which, measures, the, level, of, glucose, in, the, blood, after, 8, hours, of, fasting, another, test, is, the, 2, hour, glucose, tolerance, test, gtt, for, this, test, the, person, has, a, fasting, glucose, test, done, then, drinks, a, 75, gram, glucose, drink, and, is, retested, this, test, measures, the, ability, of, the, person, s, body, to, process, glucose, over, time, the, blood, glucose, levels, should, decrease, as, insulin, allows, it, to, be, taken, up, by, cells, and, exit, the, blood, stream, individuals, with, diabetes, or, other, conditions, that, result, in, low, blood, sugar, often, carry, small, amounts, of, sugar, in, various, forms, one, sugar, commonly, used, is, glucose, often, in, the, form, of, glucose, tablets, glucose, pressed, into, a, tablet, shape, sometimes, with, one, or, more, other, ingredients, as, a, binder, hard, candy, or, sugar, packet, most, dietary, carbohydrates, contain, glucose, either, as, their, only, building, block, as, in, the, polysaccharides, starch, and, glycogen, or, together, with, another, monosaccharide, as, in, the, hetero, polysaccharides, sucrose, and, lactose, unbound, glucose, is, one, of, the, main, ingredients, of, honey, glucose, is, extremely, abundant, and,

called, test, strip, which, assumes, a, more, or, less, intense, color, this, can, be, measured, reflectometrically, at, 510, nm, with, the, aid, of, an, led, based, handheld, photometer, this, allows, routine, blood, sugar, determination, by, nonscientists, in, addition, to, the, reaction, of, phenol, with, 4, aminoantipyrine, new, chromogenic, reactions, have, been, developed, that, allow, photometry, at, higher, wavelengths, 550, nm, 750, nm, the, electroanalysis, of, glucose, is, also, based, on, the, enzymatic, reaction, mentioned, above, the, produced, hydrogen, peroxide, can, be, amperometrically, quantified, by, anodic, oxidation, at, a, potential, of, 600, mv, the, gox, is, immobilized, on, the, electrode, surface, or, in, a, membrane, placed, close, to, the, electrode, precious, metals, such, as, platinum, or, gold, are, used, in, electrodes, as, well, as, carbon, nanotube, electrodes, which, e, g, are, doped, with, boron, cu, cuo, nanowires, are, also, used, as, enzyme, free, amperometric, electrodes, reaching, a, detection, limit, of, 50, mol, l, a, particularly, promising, method, is, the, so, called, enzyme, wiring, where, the, electron, flowing, during, the, oxidation, is, transferred, via, a, molecular, wire, directly, from, the, enzyme, to, the, electrode, there, are, a, variety, of, other, chemical, sensors, for, measuring, glucose, given, the, importance, of, glucose, analysis, in, the, life, sciences, numerous, optical, probes, have, also, been, developed, for, saccharides, based, on, the, use, of, boronic, acids, which, are, particularly, useful, for, intracellular, sensory, applications, where, other, optical, methods, are, not, or, only, conditionally, usable, in, addition, to, the, organic, boronic, acid, derivatives, which, often, bind, highly, specifically, to, the, 1, 2, diol, groups, of, sugars, there, are, also, other, probe, concepts, classified, by, functional, mechanisms, which, use, selective, glucose, binding, proteins, e, g, concanavalin, a, as, a, receptor, furthermore, methods, were, developed, which, indirectly, detect, the, glucose, concentration, via, the, concentration, of, metabolized, products, e, g, by, the, consumption, of, oxygen, using, fluorescence, optical, sensors, finally, there, are, enzyme, based, concepts, that, use, the, intrinsic, absorbance, or, fluorescence, of, fluorescence, labeled, enzymes, as, reporters, glucose, can, be, quantified, by, copper, iodometry, in, particular, for, the, analysis, of, complex, mixtures, containing, glucose, e, g, in, honey, chromatographic, methods, such, as, high, performance, liquid, chromatography, and, gas, chromatography, are, often, used, in, combination, with, mass, spectrometry, taking, into, account, the, isotope, ratios, it, is, also, possible, to, reliably, detect, honey, adulteration, by, added, sugars, with, these, methods, derivatization, using, silylation, reagents, is, commonly, used, also, the, proportions, of, di, and, trisaccharides, can, be, quantified, glucose, uptake, in, cells, of, organisms, is, measured, with, 2, deoxy, d, glucose, or, fluorodeoxyglucose, 18, f, fluorodeoxyglucose, is, used, as, a, tracer, in, positron, emission, tomography, in, oncology, and, neurology, where, it, is, by, far, the, most, commonly, used, diagnostic, agent, glucose, hexokinase, glucose, 6, phosphate, glucose, 6,
