pharomachrus, mocinno, costaricensis, pharomachrus, mocinno, mocinno, the, resplendent, quetzal, pharomachrus, mocinno, is, a, small, bird, found, in, central, america, and, southern, mexico, that, lives, in, tropical, forests, particularly, montane, cloud, forests, they, are, part, of, the, family, trogonidae, and, have, two, recognized, subspecies, p, m, mocinno, and, p, m, costaricensis, like, other, quetzals, the, resplendent, is, mostly, omnivorous, its, diet, mainly, consists, of, fruits, of, plants, in, the, laurel, family, lauraceae, but, it, occasionally, also, preys, on, insects, lizards, frogs, and, snails, the, species, is, well, known, for, its, colorful, and, complex, plumage, that, differs, substantially, between, sexes, males, have, iridescent, green, plumes, a, red, lower, breast, and, belly, black, innerwings, and, a, white, undertail, whilst, females, are, duller, and, have, a, shorter, tail, grey, lower, breasts, bellies, and, bills, along, with, bronze, green, heads, are, characteristic, of, females, these, birds, hollow, holes, in, decaying, trees, or, use, ones, already, made, by, woodpeckers, as, a, nest, site, they, are, known, to, take, turns, while, incubating, males, throughout, the, day, and, females, at, night, the, female, usually, lays, one, to, three, eggs, which, hatch, in, 17, to, 19, days, the, quetzal, is, an, altitudinal, migrant, migrating, from, the, slopes, to, the, canopy, of, the, forest, this, occurs, during, the, breeding, season, which, varies, depending, on, the, location, but, usually, commences, in, march, and, extends, as, far, as, august, the, resplendent, quetzal, is, considered, near, threatened, on, the, iucn, red, list, with, habitat, destruction, being, the, main, threat, it, has, an, important, role, in, mesoamerican, mythology, and, is, closely, associated, with, quetzalcoatl, a, deity, it, is, the, national, animal, of, guatemala, being, pictured, on, the, flag, and, coat, of, arms, it, also, gives, its, name, to, the, country, s, currency, the, guatemalan, quetzal, the, resplendent, quetzal, was, first, described, by, mexican, naturalist, pablo, de, la, llave, in, 1832, it, is, one, of, five, species, of, the, genus, pharomachrus, commonly, known, as, quetzals, quetzal, is, usually, specifically, used, to, refer, to, the, resplendent, but, it, typically, applies, to, all, members, of, the, genera, pharomachrus, and, euptilotis, some, scholars, label, the, crested, quetzal, as, a, very, close, relative, of, the, resplendent, and, either, suggest, the, crested, quetzal, to, be, a, subspecies, of, the, resplendent, or, the, two, form, a, superspecies, the, quetzal, clade, is, thought, to, have, spread, out, from, where, it, emerged, in, the, andes, the, resplendent, quetzal, being, the, youngest, species, the, name, of, the, genus, pharomachrus, refers, to, the, physical, characteristics, of, the, bird, with, pharos, meaning, mantle, and, makros, meaning, long, in, ancient, greek, the, word, quetzal, came, from, nahuatl, aztec, where, quetzalli, from, the, root, quetza, meaning, stand, means, tall, upstanding, plume, and, then, quetzal, tail, feather, from, that, nahuatl, quetzaltot, tl, means, quetzal, feather, bird, and, thus, quetzal, two, subspecies, are, recognized, p, m, mocinno, and, p, m, costaricensis, although, there, is, an, ongoing, debate, about, whether, costaricensis, should, be, recognized, as, a, distinct, species, the, specific, epithet, mocinno, is, a, latinization, of, the, name, of, the, biologist, jos, mariano, m, moci, o, a, mentor, of, his, the, resplendent, quetzal, is, the, largest, trogon, it, is, 36, to, 40, cm, 14, 16, in, long, in, the, nominate, subspecies, the, tail, streamers, measure, between, 31, cm, 12, in, and, 100, 5, cm, 39, 6, in, with, the, median, being, 75, cm, 30, in, for, males, the, nominate, subspecies, weighs, about, 210, g, 7, 4, oz, while, the, subspecies, costaricensis, is, slightly, smaller, than, the, nominate, race, with, shorter, wings, and, bills, the, tail, plumes, are, shorter, and, narrower, measuring, between, 32, cm, 13, in, and, 86, cm, 34, in, with, the, median, being, 63, cm, 25, in, resplendent, quetzals, have, a, green, body, showing, iridescence, from, green, gold, to, blue, violet, and, a, red, lower, breast, and, belly, depending, on, the, light, quetzal, feathers, can, shine, in, a, variant, of, colors, from, green, cobalt, lime, and, yellow, to, ultramarine, their, green, upper, tail, coverts, hide, their, tails, and, are, particularly, splendid, in, breeding, males, being, longer, than, the, rest, of, the, body, though, the, quetzal, s, plumage, appears, green, they, are, actually, brown, due, to, the, pigment, melanin, the, primary, wing, coverts, are, also, unusually, long, and, have, a, fringed, appearance, the, male, has, a, helmet, like, crest, the, bill, which, is, partly, covered, by, green, filamentous, feathers, is, yellow, in, mature, males, and, grey, in, females, their, iridescent, feathers, which, cause, them, to, appear, shiny, and, green, like, the, canopy, leaves, are, a, camouflage, adaptation, to, hide, within, the, canopy, during, rainy, weather, the, quetzal, s, skin, is, very, thin, and, easily, torn, so, it, has, evolved, thick, plumage, to, protect, its, skin, it, has, large, eyes, adapted, to, see, in, the, dim, light, of, the, forest, their, song, is, an, array, of, full, toned, mellow, slurred, notes, in, plain, patterns, and, is, often, remarkably, melodious, keow, kowee, keow, k, loo, keeloo, this, species, inhabits, amidst, lush, vegetation, in, specially, moist, rainforests, at, high, elevations, 900, 3, 200, m, 3, 000, 10, 500, ft, they, populate, trees, that, make, up, the, canopy, and, subcanopy, of, the, rainforest, though, they, can, also, be, found, in, ravines, and, cliffs, it, prefers, to, live, in, decaying, trees, stumps, and, abandoned, woodpecker, hollows, the, vivid, colors, of, the, quetzal, are, disguised, by, the, rainforest, the, resplendent, quetzal, can, be, found, from, southern, mexico, southernmost, oaxaca, and, chiapas, to, western, panama, chiriqu, the, ranges, of, the, two, subspecies, differ, p, m, mocinno, is, found, in, southern, mexico, northern, el, salvador, and, northwestern, nicaragua, guatemala, and, honduras, while, p, m, costaricensis, is, found, in, costa, rica, and, western, panama, the, geographical, isolation, between, the, two, subspecies, is, caused, by, the, nicaraguan, depression, a, 50, km, 31, mi, wide, 600, km, 370, mi, long, bottomland, that, contains, the, two, largest, lakes, in, central, america, lake, managua, and, lake, nicaragua, and, the, deficiency, of, the, breeding, habitats, in, regions, adjoining, to, the, quetzal, migrates, from, its, breeding, areas, in, the, lower, montane, rainforest, to, the, pre, montane, rainforest, on, the, pacific, slopes, for, three, to, four, months, july, october, after, which, they, move, across, the, continental, divide, to, the, atlantic, slopes, quetzal, s, abundance, in, its, mating, areas, is, correlated, with, the, total, number, of, fruiting, species, although, the, correlation, between, quetzal, abundance, and, the, number, of, fruiting, lauraceae, species, is, only, marginal, resplendent, quetzals, generally, display, shy, and, quiet, behaviour, to, elude, predators, in, contrast, they, are, rather, vocal, during, the, mating, season, and, their, behavior, is, designated, to, exhibit, and, attract, mates, their, known, predators, include, the, ornate, hawk, eagle, golden, eagle, and, other, hawks, and, owls, as, adults, along, with, emerald, toucanets, brown, jays, long, tailed, weasels, squirrels, and, kinkajous, as, nestlings, or, eggs, the, resplendent, quetzal, plays, an, important, ecological, role, in, the, cloud, forests, helping, disseminate, the, seeds, of, at, least, 32, tree, species, resplendent, quetzals, are, considered, specialized, fruit, eaters, feeding, on, 41, to, 43, species, although, they, also, feed, on, insects, primarily, wasps, ants, and, larvae, frogs, lizards, and, snails, particularly, important, are, the, symplococarpon, purpusii, and, wild, avocados, as, well, as, other, fruits, of, the, laurel, family, which, the, birds, swallow, whole, before, regurgitating, the, pits, which, helps, to, disperse, these, trees, quetzals, feed, more, frequently, in, the, midday, hours, the, adults, eat, a, more, fruit, based, diet, than, the, chicks, who, eat, insects, primarily, and, some, fruits, over, fifty, percent, of, the, fruit, they, eat, are, laurels, quetzals, use, the, methods, of, hovering, and, stalling, in, order, to, selectively, pick, the, fruit, from, near, the, tips, of, the, branches, resplendent, quetzals, create, their, nests, over, 200, feet, 60, m, up, in, the, air, and, court, in, the, air, with, specific, calls, six, specific, vocal, calls, have, been, recorded, the, two, note, whistle, gee, gee, wahc, ah, wahc, wec, wec, whistle, coouee, uwac, chatter, and, buzzing, the, first, call, is, related, to, male, territorial, behavior, while, the, coouee, whistle, is, a, mating, call, resplendent, quetzals, usually, live, alone, when, not, breeding, they, are, monogamous, territorial, breeders, with, the, size, of, their, territory, in, guatemala, being, 6, 10, ha, 15, 25, acres, they, are, also, seasonal, breeders, with, the, breeding, season, lasting, from, march, to, april, in, mexico, may, to, june, in, el, salvador, and, march, to, may, in, guatemala, when, breeding, females, lay, one, to, three, pale, blue, eggs, with, a, mean, of, 38, 9, millimetres, 1, 53, in, x, 32, 4, millimetres, 1, 28, in, in, a, nest, placed, in, a, hole, which, they, carve, in, a, rotten, tree, resplendent, quetzals, tend, to, lay, two, clutches, per, year, and, are, known, to, have, a, high, rate, of, nest, failure, 67, 78, one, of, the, most, important, factors, when, choosing, a, nest, location, for, the, quetzal, is, that, the, tree, must, be, in, a, stage, of, decomposition, and, decay, they, often, reuse, their, previous, sites, the, height, of, nest, stubs, is, 41, feet, 10, m, and, the, nest, holes, 31, feet, 9, m, both, parents, take, turns, at, incubating, with, their, long, tail, coverts, folded, forwards, over, out, of, the, hole, giving, them, the, appearance, of, a, bunch, of, fern, growing, out, of, the, hole, the, incubation, period, lasts, about, 17, to, 19, days, during, which, the, male, generally, incubates, the, eggs, during, the, day, while, the, female, incubates, them, at, night, when, the, eggs, hatch, both, parents, take, care, of, the, young, feeding, them, entire, fruits, such, as, berries, and, avocados, as, early, as, the, second, day, however, chicks, are, primarily, fed, insects, lizards, snails, and, small, frogs, it, was, observed, that, males, generally, give, more, food, namely, insects, than, females, nestlings, are, often, neglected, and, even, abandoned, by, females, near, the, end, of, the, rearing, period, leaving, it, up, to, the, male, to, continue, caring, for, the, offspring, until, they, are, ready, to, survive, on, their, own, during, the, incubation, period, parents, land, and, rotate, their, heads, side, to, side, before, entering, the, nest, a, process, known, as, bowing, in, this, process, ends, when, the, chicks, hatch, young, quetzals, begin, flying, after, a, month, but, the, distinctive, long, tail, feathers, can, take, three, years, to, develop, in, males, the, population, trend, varies, between, subpopulations, but, is, generally, decreasing, although, certain, populations, may, be, increasing, or, are, at, least, stable, it, is, classified, as, being, near, threatened, on, the, iucn, red, list, with, an, estimated, population, of, 20, 000, 49, 999, individuals, due, to, the, remote, habitat, of, the, quetzal, more, monitoring, is, required, to, confirm, the, rate, of, decline, and, depending, on, the, results, it, could, lead, to, it, moving, to, a, higher, threat, category, in, 2001, the, quetzal, survived, only, in, 11, small, isolated, patches, of, forest, its, biggest, threats, are, habitat, loss, because, of, deforestation, forest, fragmentation, and, agricultural, clearing, the, quetzal, is, also, sometimes, hunted, for, food, and, trapped, for, illegal, trading, cloud, forests, the, resplendent, quetzal, s, habitat, are, one, of, the, most, threatened, ecosystems, in, the, world, but, the, species, occurs, in, several, protected, areas, and, is, a, sought, after, species, for, birdwatchers, and, ecotourists, it, was, thought, that, the, resplendent, quetzal, could, not, be, bred, or, held, for, a, long, time, in, captivity, and, was, noted, for, usually, dying, soon, after, being, captured, or, caged, as, a, result, of, assimilation, of, iron, through, water, ingestion, with, this, now, understood, they, are, now, given, tannic, acid, and, iron, is, avoided, in, their, diet, for, this, reason, it, is, a, traditional, symbol, of, liberty, the, national, anthem, of, guatemala, even, includes, the, verse, antes, muerto, que, esclavo, ser, be, rather, dead, than, a, slave, however, the, scientific, discovery, about, the, bird, s, susceptibility, to, iron, has, allowed, some, zoos, including, miguel, lvarez, del, toro, zoo, in, tuxtla, guti, rrez, chiapas, to, keep, this, species, breeding, in, captivity, was, announced, in, 2004, the, resplendent, quetzal, is, of, great, importance, to, guatemalan, culture, being, present, in, various, legends, and, myths, it, was, considered, divine, and, associated, with, quetzalcoatl, a, feathered, serpent, and, god, of, life, light, knowledge, and, the, winds, by, pre, columbian, mesoamerican, civilizations, its, scintillating, green, tail, feathers, symbolizes, spring, plant, sprout, were, venerated, by, the, aztec, and, maya, the, maya, also, regarded, the, quetzal, as, representative, of, freedom, and, wealth, on, account, of, quetzals, dying, in, captivity, and, the, worth, of, their, feathers, along, with, jade, correspondingly, mesoamerican, rulers, and, some, high, ranked, nobles, wore, diadems, created, from, quetzal, feathers, symbolically, linking, them, to, quetzalcoatl, since, the, killing, of, quetzals, was, forbidden, under, the, mayas, and, aztec, criminal, law, the, bird, was, merely, seized, its, prolonged, tail, feathers, deplumed, and, was, set, loose, in, ancient, mayan, culture, the, quetzal, feathers, were, considered, so, precious, that, they, were, even, used, as, a, medium, of, exchange, thus, the, name, of, the, guatemala, currency, the, quetzal, in, various, mesoamerican, languages, the, word, quetzal, can, as, well, mean, precious, sacred, or, king, warrior, prince, one, mayan, legend, has, it, that, a, resplendent, quetzal, accompanied, the, hero, tec, n, um, n, prince, of, the, quich, k, iche, maya, during, his, battle, against, spanish, conquistador, pedro, de, alvarado, tec, n, equipped, with, just, an, arrow, and, bow, nevertheless, is, able, to, incapacitate, alvarado, s, horse, on, the, first, strike, alvarado, was, then, given, a, second, horse, and, counter, charged, against, tec, n, running, his, chest, through, with, a, spear, a, quetzal, flew, down, and, alighted, on, tec, n, s, body, drenching, its, chest, in, his, blood, it, was, then, that, the, species, which, used, to, be, completely, green, obtained, its, characteristic, red, chest, feathers, additionally, from, that, day, on, the, quetzal, which, sang, delightfully, before, the, spanish, conquest, has, been, mute, ever, since, it, will, sing, anew, solely, when, the, land, is, fully, liberated
