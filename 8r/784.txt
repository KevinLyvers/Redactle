capra, aegagrus, hircus, linnaeus, 1758, capra, depressa, linnaeus, 1758, capra, mambrica, linnaeus, 1758, capra, reversa, linnaeus, 1758, the, goat, or, domestic, goat, capra, hircus, is, a, species, of, domesticated, goat, antelope, that, is, mostly, kept, as, livestock, it, was, domesticated, from, the, bezoar, ibex, c, aegagrus, aegagrus, of, southwest, asia, and, eastern, europe, the, goat, is, a, member, of, the, family, bovidae, meaning, it, is, closely, related, to, the, sheep, there, are, more, than, 300, distinct, breeds, of, goat, it, is, one, of, the, oldest, domesticated, species, of, animal, according, to, archaeological, evidence, its, earliest, domestication, occurred, in, iran, at, 10, 000, calibrated, calendar, years, ago, goats, have, been, used, for, milk, meat, fur, and, skins, across, much, of, the, world, milk, from, goats, is, often, turned, into, goat, cheese, in, 2011, there, were, more, than, 924, million, goats, living, in, the, world, according, to, the, un, food, and, agriculture, organization, the, modern, english, word, goat, comes, from, old, english, g, t, she, goat, goat, in, general, which, in, turn, derives, from, proto, germanic, gaitaz, cf, dutch, frisian, icelandic, norwegian, geit, german, gei, and, gothic, gaits, ultimately, from, proto, indo, european, aidos, meaning, young, goat, cf, latin, haedus, kid, to, refer, to, the, male, goat, old, english, used, bucca, cf, dutch, frisian, bok, and, giving, modern, buck, until, ousted, by, hegote, hegoote, in, the, late, 12th, century, nanny, goat, females, originated, in, the, 18th, century, and, billy, goat, for, males, originated, in, the, 19th, century, castrated, males, are, called, wethers, while, the, words, hircine, and, caprine, both, refer, to, anything, having, a, goat, like, quality, hircine, is, used, most, often, to, emphasize, the, distinct, smell, of, domestic, goats, goats, are, among, the, earliest, animals, domesticated, by, humans, the, most, recent, genetic, analysis, confirms, the, archaeological, evidence, that, the, wild, bezoar, ibex, of, the, zagros, mountains, is, the, likely, original, ancestor, of, all, or, most, domestic, goats, today, neolithic, farmers, began, to, herd, wild, goats, primarily, for, easy, access, to, milk, and, meat, as, well, as, to, their, dung, which, was, used, as, fuel, and, their, bones, hair, and, sinew, were, used, for, clothing, building, and, tools, the, earliest, remnants, of, domesticated, goats, dating, 10, 000, years, before, present, are, found, in, ganj, dareh, in, iran, goat, remains, have, been, found, at, archaeological, sites, in, jericho, choga, mami, djeitun, and, ay, n, dating, the, domestication, of, goats, in, western, asia, at, between, 8, 000, and, 9, 000, years, ago, studies, of, dna, evidence, suggests, 10, 000, years, ago, as, the, domestication, date, historically, goat, hide, has, been, used, for, water, and, wine, bottles, in, both, traveling, and, transporting, wine, for, sale, it, has, also, been, used, to, produce, parchment, each, recognized, breed, of, goat, has, specific, weight, ranges, which, vary, from, more, than, 140, kg, 300, lb, for, bucks, of, larger, breeds, such, as, the, boer, to, 20, to, 27, kg, 45, to, 60, lb, for, smaller, goat, does, within, each, breed, different, strains, or, bloodlines, may, have, different, recognized, sizes, at, the, bottom, of, the, size, range, are, miniature, breeds, such, as, the, african, pygmy, which, stand, 41, to, 58, cm, 16, to, 23, in, at, the, shoulder, as, adults, most, goats, naturally, have, two, horns, of, various, shapes, and, sizes, depending, on, the, breed, there, have, been, incidents, of, polycerate, goats, having, as, many, as, eight, horns, although, this, is, a, genetic, rarity, thought, to, be, inherited, unlike, cattle, goats, have, not, been, successfully, bred, to, be, reliably, polled, as, the, genes, determining, sex, and, those, determining, horns, are, closely, linked, breeding, together, two, genetically, polled, goats, results, in, a, high, number, of, intersex, individuals, among, the, offspring, which, are, typically, sterile, their, horns, are, made, of, living, bone, surrounded, by, keratin, and, other, proteins, and, are, used, for, defense, dominance, territoriality, and, thermoregulation, both, male, and, female, goats, may, have, beards, and, many, types, of, goat, most, commonly, dairy, goats, dairy, cross, boers, and, pygmy, goats, may, have, wattles, one, dangling, from, each, side, of, the, neck, goats, have, horizontal, slit, shaped, pupils, because, goats, irises, are, usually, pale, their, contrasting, pupils, are, much, more, noticeable, than, in, animals, such, as, cattle, deer, most, horses, and, many, sheep, whose, similarly, horizontal, pupils, blend, into, a, dark, iris, and, sclera, goats, have, no, tear, ducts, goats, are, ruminants, they, have, a, four, chambered, stomach, consisting, of, the, rumen, the, reticulum, the, omasum, and, the, abomasum, as, with, other, mammal, ruminants, they, are, even, toed, ungulates, the, females, have, an, udder, consisting, of, two, teats, in, contrast, to, cattle, which, have, four, teats, an, exception, to, this, is, the, boer, goat, which, sometimes, may, have, up, to, eight, teats, goats, expressing, the, tan, pattern, have, coats, pigmented, completely, with, pheomelanin, tan, brown, pigment, the, allele, which, codes, for, this, pattern, is, located, at, the, agouti, locus, of, the, goat, genome, it, is, completely, dominant, to, all, other, alleles, at, this, locus, there, are, multiple, modifier, genes, which, control, how, much, tan, pigment, is, actually, expressed, so, a, tan, patterned, goat, can, have, a, coat, ranging, from, pure, white, to, deep, red, goats, are, diploid, and, have, 60, chromosomes, the, slc11a1, gene, is, located, on, goat, chromosome, 2, goats, are, naturally, curious, they, are, also, agile, and, well, known, for, their, ability, to, climb, and, balance, in, precarious, places, this, makes, them, the, only, ruminant, to, regularly, climb, trees, due, to, their, agility, and, inquisitiveness, they, are, notorious, for, escaping, their, pens, by, testing, fences, and, enclosures, either, intentionally, or, simply, because, they, are, used, to, climbing, if, any, of, the, fencing, can, be, overcome, goats, will, almost, inevitably, escape, goats, have, been, found, to, be, as, intelligent, as, dogs, by, some, studies, when, handled, as, a, group, goats, tend, to, display, less, herding, behavior, than, sheep, when, grazing, undisturbed, they, tend, to, spread, across, the, field, or, range, rather, than, feed, side, by, side, as, do, sheep, when, nursing, young, goats, will, leave, their, kids, separated, lying, out, rather, than, clumped, as, do, sheep, they, will, generally, turn, and, face, an, intruder, and, bucks, are, more, likely, to, charge, or, butt, at, humans, than, are, rams, a, study, by, queen, mary, university, reports, that, goats, try, to, communicate, with, people, in, the, same, manner, as, domesticated, animals, such, as, dogs, and, horses, goats, were, first, domesticated, as, livestock, more, than, 10, 000, years, ago, research, conducted, to, test, communication, skills, found, that, the, goats, will, look, to, a, human, for, assistance, when, faced, with, a, challenge, that, had, previously, been, mastered, but, was, then, modified, specifically, when, presented, with, a, box, the, goat, was, able, to, remove, the, lid, and, retrieve, a, treat, inside, but, when, the, box, was, turned, so, the, lid, could, not, be, removed, the, goat, would, turn, and, gaze, at, the, person, and, move, toward, them, before, looking, back, toward, the, box, this, is, the, same, type, of, complex, communication, observed, by, animals, bred, as, domestic, pets, such, as, dogs, researchers, believe, that, better, understanding, of, human, goat, interaction, could, offer, overall, improvement, in, the, animals, welfare, the, field, of, anthrozoology, has, established, that, domesticated, animals, have, the, capacity, for, complex, communication, with, humans, when, in, 2015, a, japanese, scientist, determined, that, levels, of, oxytocin, did, increase, in, human, subjects, when, dogs, were, exposed, to, a, dose, of, the, love, hormone, proving, that, a, human, animal, bond, does, exist, this, is, the, same, affinity, that, was, proven, with, the, london, study, above, goats, are, intelligent, capable, of, complex, communication, and, able, to, form, bonds, goats, reach, puberty, between, three, and, 15, months, of, age, depending, on, breed, and, nutritional, status, many, breeders, prefer, to, postpone, breeding, until, the, doe, has, reached, 70, of, the, adult, weight, but, this, separation, is, rarely, possible, in, extensively, managed, open, range, herds, in, temperate, climates, and, among, the, swiss, breeds, the, breeding, season, commences, as, the, day, length, shortens, and, ends, in, early, spring, or, before, in, equatorial, regions, goats, are, able, to, breed, at, any, time, of, the, year, successful, breeding, in, these, regions, depends, more, on, available, forage, than, on, day, length, does, of, any, breed, or, region, come, into, estrus, heat, every, 21, days, for, two, to, 48, hours, a, doe, in, heat, typically, flags, vigorously, wags, her, tail, often, stays, near, the, buck, if, one, is, present, becomes, more, vocal, and, may, also, show, a, decrease, in, appetite, and, milk, production, for, the, duration, of, the, heat, bucks, intact, males, of, swiss, and, northern, breeds, come, into, rut, in, the, fall, as, with, the, does, heat, cycles, bucks, of, equatorial, breeds, may, show, seasonal, reduced, fertility, but, as, with, the, does, are, capable, of, breeding, at, all, times, rut, is, characterized, by, a, decrease, in, appetite, and, obsessive, interest, in, the, does, a, buck, in, rut, will, display, flehmen, lip, curling, and, will, urinate, on, his, forelegs, and, face, sebaceous, scent, glands, at, the, base, of, the, horns, add, to, the, male, goat, s, odor, which, is, important, to, make, him, attractive, to, the, female, some, does, will, not, mate, with, a, buck, which, has, been, descented, in, addition, to, natural, traditional, mating, artificial, insemination, has, gained, popularity, among, goat, breeders, as, it, allows, easy, access, to, a, wide, variety, of, bloodlines, gestation, length, is, approximately, 150, days, twins, are, the, usual, result, with, single, and, triplet, births, also, common, less, frequent, are, litters, of, quadruplet, quintuplet, and, even, sextuplet, kids, birthing, known, as, kidding, generally, occurs, uneventfully, just, before, kidding, the, doe, will, have, a, sunken, area, around, the, tail, and, hip, as, well, as, heavy, breathing, she, may, have, a, worried, look, become, restless, and, display, great, affection, for, her, keeper, the, mother, often, eats, the, placenta, which, gives, her, much, needed, nutrients, helps, stanch, her, bleeding, and, parallels, the, behavior, of, wild, herbivores, such, as, deer, to, reduce, the, lure, of, the, birth, scent, for, predators, freshening, coming, into, milk, production, usually, occurs, at, kidding, although, milk, production, is, also, relatively, common, in, unbred, doelings, of, dairy, breeds, milk, production, varies, with, the, breed, age, quality, and, diet, of, the, doe, dairy, goats, generally, produce, between, 680, and, 1, 810, kg, 1, 500, and, 4, 000, lb, of, milk, per, 305, day, lactation, on, average, a, good, quality, dairy, doe, will, give, at, least, 3, kg, 6, lb, of, milk, per, day, while, she, is, in, milk, a, first, time, milker, may, produce, less, or, as, much, as, 7, kg, 16, lb, or, more, of, milk, in, exceptional, cases, after, the, lactation, the, doe, will, dry, off, typically, after, she, has, been, bred, occasionally, goats, that, have, not, been, bred, and, are, continuously, milked, will, continue, lactation, beyond, the, typical, 305, days, meat, fiber, and, pet, breeds, are, not, usually, milked, and, simply, produce, enough, for, the, kids, until, weaning, male, lactation, is, also, known, to, occur, in, goats, goats, are, reputed, to, be, willing, to, eat, almost, anything, including, tin, cans, and, cardboard, boxes, while, goats, will, not, actually, eat, inedible, material, they, are, browsing, animals, not, grazers, like, cattle, and, sheep, and, coupled, with, their, highly, curious, nature, will, chew, on, and, taste, just, about, anything, remotely, resembling, plant, matter, to, decide, whether, it, is, good, to, eat, including, cardboard, clothing, and, paper, such, as, labels, from, tin, cans, aside, from, sampling, many, things, goats, are, quite, particular, in, what, they, actually, consume, preferring, to, browse, on, the, tips, of, woody, shrubs, and, trees, as, well, as, the, occasional, broad, leaved, plant, however, it, can, fairly, be, said, that, their, plant, diet, is, extremely, varied, and, includes, some, species, which, are, otherwise, toxic, they, will, seldom, consume, soiled, food, or, contaminated, water, unless, facing, starvation, this, is, one, reason, goat, rearing, is, most, often, free, ranging, since, stall, fed, goat, rearing, involves, extensive, upkeep, and, is, seldom, commercially, viable, goats, prefer, to, browse, on, vines, such, as, kudzu, on, shrubbery, and, on, weeds, more, like, deer, than, sheep, preferring, them, to, grasses, nightshade, is, poisonous, wilted, fruit, tree, leaves, can, also, kill, goats, silage, fermented, corn, stalks, and, haylage, fermented, grass, hay, can, be, used, if, consumed, immediately, after, opening, goats, are, particularly, sensitive, to, listeria, bacteria, that, can, grow, in, fermented, feeds, alfalfa, a, high, protein, plant, is, widely, fed, as, hay, fescue, is, the, least, palatable, and, least, nutritious, hay, mold, in, a, goat, s, feed, can, make, it, sick, and, possibly, kill, it, due, to, the, presence, of, mycotoxins, goats, can, contract, listeriosis, which, is, a, life, threatening, disease, often, caused, by, the, ingestion, of, moldy, hay, in, various, places, in, china, goats, are, used, in, the, production, of, tea, goats, are, released, onto, the, tea, terraces, where, they, avoid, consuming, the, green, tea, leaves, which, contain, bitter, tasting, substances, and, instead, eat, the, weeds, the, goats, droppings, fertilise, the, tea, plants, the, digestive, physiology, of, a, very, young, kid, like, the, young, of, other, ruminants, is, essentially, the, same, as, that, of, a, monogastric, animal, milk, digestion, begins, in, the, abomasum, the, milk, having, bypassed, the, rumen, via, closure, of, the, reticuloesophageal, groove, during, suckling, at, birth, the, rumen, is, undeveloped, but, as, the, kid, begins, to, consume, solid, feed, the, rumen, soon, increases, in, size, and, in, its, capacity, to, absorb, nutrients, the, adult, size, of, a, particular, goat, is, a, product, of, its, breed, genetic, potential, and, its, diet, while, growing, nutritional, potential, as, with, all, livestock, increased, protein, diets, 10, to, 14, and, sufficient, calories, during, the, prepuberty, period, yield, higher, growth, rates, and, larger, eventual, size, than, lower, protein, rates, and, limited, calories, large, framed, goats, with, a, greater, skeletal, size, reach, mature, weight, at, a, later, age, 36, to, 42, months, than, small, framed, goats, 18, to, 24, months, if, both, are, fed, to, their, full, potential, large, framed, goats, need, more, calories, than, small, framed, goats, for, maintenance, of, daily, functions, while, goats, are, generally, considered, hardy, animals, and, in, many, situations, receive, little, medical, care, they, are, subject, to, a, number, of, diseases, among, the, conditions, affecting, goats, are, respiratory, diseases, including, pneumonia, foot, rot, internal, parasites, pregnancy, toxicosis, and, feed, toxicity, feed, toxicity, can, vary, based, on, breed, and, location, certain, foreign, fruits, and, vegetables, can, be, toxic, to, different, breeds, of, goats, goats, can, become, infected, with, various, viral, and, bacterial, diseases, such, as, foot, and, mouth, disease, caprine, arthritis, encephalitis, caseous, lymphadenitis, pinkeye, mastitis, and, pseudorabies, they, can, transmit, a, number, of, zoonotic, diseases, to, people, such, as, tuberculosis, brucellosis, q, fever, and, rabies, life, expectancy, for, goats, is, between, 15, and, 18, years, an, instance, of, a, goat, reaching, the, age, of, 24, has, been, reported, several, factors, can, reduce, this, average, expectancy, problems, during, kidding, can, lower, a, doe, s, expected, life, span, to, 10, or, 11, and, stresses, of, going, into, rut, can, lower, a, buck, s, expected, life, span, to, eight, to, 10, years, a, goat, is, useful, to, humans, when, it, is, living, and, when, it, is, dead, first, as, a, renewable, provider, of, milk, manure, and, fiber, and, then, as, meat, and, hide, some, charities, provide, goats, to, impoverished, people, in, poor, countries, because, goats, are, easier, and, cheaper, to, manage, than, cattle, and, have, multiple, uses, in, addition, goats, are, used, for, driving, and, packing, purposes, the, intestine, of, goats, is, used, to, make, catgut, which, is, still, in, use, as, a, material, for, internal, human, surgical, sutures, and, strings, for, musical, instruments, the, horn, of, the, goat, which, signifies, plenty, and, wellbeing, the, cornucopia, is, also, used, to, make, spoons, goat, breeds, fall, into, overlapping, general, categories, they, are, generally, distributed, in, those, used, for, dairy, fiber, meat, skins, and, as, companion, animals, some, breeds, are, also, particularly, noted, as, pack, goats, according, to, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, the, top, producers, of, goat, milk, in, 2008, were, india, 4, million, metric, tons, bangladesh, 2, 16, million, metric, tons, and, the, sudan, 1, 47, million, metric, tons, india, slaughters, 41, of, 124, 4, million, goats, each, year, the, 0, 6, million, metric, tonnes, of, goat, meat, make, up, 8, of, india, s, annual, meat, production, approximately, 440, million, goats, are, slaughtered, each, year, for, meat, worldwide, husbandry, or, animal, care, and, use, varies, by, region, and, culture, the, particular, housing, used, for, goats, depends, not, only, on, the, intended, use, of, the, goat, but, also, on, the, region, of, the, world, where, they, are, raised, historically, domestic, goats, were, generally, kept, in, herds, that, wandered, on, hills, or, other, grazing, areas, often, tended, by, goatherds, who, were, frequently, children, or, adolescents, similar, to, the, more, widely, known, shepherd, these, methods, of, herding, are, still, used, today, in, some, parts, of, the, world, especially, europe, and, north, america, distinct, breeds, of, goats, are, kept, for, dairy, milk, and, for, meat, production, excess, male, kids, of, dairy, breeds, are, typically, slaughtered, for, meat, both, does, and, bucks, of, meat, breeds, may, be, slaughtered, for, meat, as, well, as, older, animals, of, any, breed, the, meat, of, older, bucks, more, than, one, year, old, is, generally, considered, not, desirable, for, meat, for, human, consumption, castration, at, a, young, age, prevents, the, development, of, typical, buck, odor, dairy, goats, are, generally, pastured, in, summer, and, may, be, stabled, during, the, winter, as, dairy, does, are, milked, daily, they, are, generally, kept, close, to, the, milking, shed, their, grazing, is, typically, supplemented, with, hay, and, concentrates, stabled, goats, may, be, kept, in, stalls, similar, to, horses, or, in, larger, group, pens, in, the, us, system, does, are, generally, rebred, annually, in, some, european, commercial, dairy, systems, the, does, are, bred, only, twice, and, are, milked, continuously, for, several, years, after, the, second, kidding, meat, goats, are, more, frequently, pastured, year, round, and, may, be, kept, many, miles, from, barns, angora, and, other, fiber, breeds, are, also, kept, on, pasture, or, range, range, kept, and, pastured, goats, may, be, supplemented, with, hay, or, concentrates, most, frequently, during, the, winter, or, dry, seasons, in, the, indian, subcontinent, and, much, of, asia, goats, are, kept, largely, for, milk, production, both, in, commercial, and, household, settings, the, goats, in, this, area, may, be, kept, closely, housed, or, may, be, allowed, to, range, for, fodder, the, salem, black, goat, is, herded, to, pasture, in, fields, and, along, roads, during, the, day, but, is, kept, penned, at, night, for, safe, keeping, in, africa, and, the, mideast, goats, are, typically, run, in, flocks, with, sheep, this, maximizes, the, production, per, acre, as, goats, and, sheep, prefer, different, food, plants, multiple, types, of, goat, raising, are, found, in, ethiopia, where, four, main, types, have, been, identified, pastured, in, annual, crop, systems, in, perennial, crop, systems, with, cattle, and, in, arid, areas, under, pastoral, nomadic, herding, systems, in, all, four, systems, however, goats, were, typically, kept, in, extensive, systems, with, few, purchased, inputs, household, goats, are, traditionally, kept, in, nigeria, while, many, goats, are, allowed, to, wander, the, homestead, or, village, others, are, kept, penned, and, fed, in, what, is, called, a, cut, and, carry, system, this, type, of, husbandry, is, also, used, in, parts, of, latin, america, cut, and, carry, which, refers, to, the, practice, of, cutting, down, grasses, corn, or, cane, for, feed, rather, than, allowing, the, animal, access, to, the, field, is, particularly, suited, for, types, of, feed, such, as, corn, or, cane, that, are, easily, destroyed, by, trampling, pet, goats, may, be, found, in, many, parts, of, the, world, when, a, family, keeps, one, or, more, animals, for, emotional, reasons, rather, than, as, production, animals, it, is, becoming, more, common, for, goats, to, be, kept, exclusively, as, pets, in, north, america, and, europe, the, taste, of, goat, kid, meat, is, similar, to, that, of, spring, lamb, meat, in, fact, in, the, english, speaking, islands, of, the, caribbean, and, in, some, parts, of, asia, particularly, bangladesh, pakistan, and, india, the, word, mutton, is, used, to, describe, both, goat, and, sheep, meat, however, some, compare, the, taste, of, goat, meat, to, veal, or, venison, depending, on, the, age, and, condition, of, the, goat, its, flavor, is, said, to, be, primarily, linked, to, the, presence, of, 4, methyloctanoic, and, 4, methylnonanoic, acid, it, can, be, prepared, in, a, variety, of, ways, including, stewing, baking, grilling, barbecuing, canning, and, frying, it, can, be, minced, curried, or, made, into, sausage, due, to, its, low, fat, content, the, meat, can, toughen, at, high, temperatures, if, cooked, without, additional, moisture, one, of, the, most, popular, goats, grown, for, meat, is, the, south, african, boer, introduced, into, the, united, states, in, the, early, 1990s, the, new, zealand, kiko, is, also, considered, a, meat, breed, as, is, the, myotonic, or, fainting, goat, a, breed, originating, in, tennessee, goats, produce, about, 2, of, the, world, s, total, annual, milk, supply, some, goats, are, bred, specifically, for, milk, if, the, strong, smelling, buck, is, not, separated, from, the, does, his, scent, will, affect, the, milk, goat, milk, naturally, has, small, well, emulsified, fat, globules, which, means, the, cream, remains, suspended, in, the, milk, instead, of, rising, to, the, top, as, in, raw, cow, milk, therefore, it, does, not, need, to, be, homogenized, indeed, if, the, milk, is, to, be, used, to, make, cheese, homogenization, is, not, recommended, as, this, changes, the, structure, of, the, milk, affecting, the, culture, s, ability, to, coagulate, the, milk, and, the, final, quality, and, yield, of, cheese, dairy, goats, in, their, prime, generally, around, the, third, or, fourth, lactation, cycle, average, 2, 7, to, 3, 6, kg, 6, to, 8, lb, of, milk, production, daily, roughly, 2, 8, to, 3, 8, l, 3, to, 4, u, s, qt, during, a, ten, month, lactation, producing, more, just, after, freshening, and, gradually, dropping, in, production, toward, the, end, of, their, lactation, the, milk, generally, averages, 3, 5, butterfat, goat, milk, is, commonly, processed, into, cheese, butter, ice, cream, yogurt, cajeta, and, other, products, goat, cheese, is, known, as, fromage, de, ch, vre, goat, cheese, in, france, some,

s, milk, products, have, made, claims, that, goat, s, milk, is, better, for, human, health, than, most, western, cow, s, milk, due, to, it, mostly, lacking, a, form, of, casein, proteins, called, a1, and, instead, mostly, containing, the, a2, form, which, does, not, metabolize, to, casomorphin, 7, in, the, body, these, compositions, vary, by, breed, especially, in, the, nigerian, dwarf, breed,
