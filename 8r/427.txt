see, taxonomy, section, crickets, are, orthopteran, insects, which, are, related, to, bush, crickets, and, more, distantly, to, grasshoppers, in, older, literature, such, as, imms, crickets, were, placed, at, the, family, level, i, e, gryllidae, but, contemporary, authorities, including, otte, now, place, them, in, the, superfamily, grylloidea, the, word, has, been, used, in, combination, to, describe, more, distantly, related, taxa, in, the, suborder, ensifera, such, as, king, crickets, and, mole, crickets, crickets, have, mainly, cylindrically, shaped, bodies, round, heads, and, long, antennae, behind, the, head, is, a, smooth, robust, pronotum, the, abdomen, ends, in, a, pair, of, long, cerci, females, have, a, long, cylindrical, ovipositor, diagnostic, features, include, legs, with, 3, segmented, tarsi, as, with, many, orthoptera, the, hind, legs, have, enlarged, femora, providing, power, for, jumping, the, front, wings, are, adapted, as, tough, leathery, elytra, and, some, crickets, chirp, by, rubbing, parts, of, these, together, the, hind, wings, are, membranous, and, folded, when, not, in, use, for, flight, many, species, however, are, flightless, the, largest, members, of, the, family, are, the, bull, crickets, brachytrupes, which, are, up, to, 5, cm, 2, in, long, crickets, are, distributed, all, around, the, world, except, at, latitudes, 55, or, higher, with, the, greatest, diversity, being, in, the, tropics, they, occur, in, varied, habitats, from, grassland, bushes, and, forests, to, marshes, beaches, and, caves, crickets, are, mainly, nocturnal, and, are, best, known, for, the, loud, persistent, chirping, song, of, males, trying, to, attract, females, although, some, species, are, mute, the, singing, species, have, good, hearing, via, the, tympana, on, the, tibiae, of, the, front, legs, crickets, often, appear, as, characters, in, literature, the, talking, cricket, features, in, carlo, collodi, s, 1883, children, s, book, the, adventures, of, pinocchio, and, in, films, based, on, the, book, the, insect, is, central, to, charles, dickens, s, 1845, the, cricket, on, the, hearth, and, george, selden, s, 1960, the, cricket, in, times, square, crickets, are, celebrated, in, poems, by, william, wordsworth, john, keats, du, fu, and, vladimir, nazor, they, are, kept, as, pets, in, countries, from, china, to, europe, sometimes, for, cricket, fighting, crickets, are, efficient, at, converting, their, food, into, body, mass, making, them, a, candidate, for, food, production, they, are, used, as, human, food, in, southeast, asia, where, they, are, sold, deep, fried, in, markets, as, snacks, they, are, also, used, to, feed, carnivorous, pets, and, zoo, animals, in, brazilian, folklore, crickets, feature, as, omens, of, various, events, crickets, are, small, to, medium, sized, insects, with, mostly, cylindrical, somewhat, vertically, flattened, bodies, the, head, is, spherical, with, long, slender, antennae, arising, from, cone, shaped, scapes, first, segments, and, just, behind, these, are, two, large, compound, eyes, on, the, forehead, are, three, ocelli, simple, eyes, the, pronotum, first, thoracic, segment, is, trapezoidal, in, shape, robust, and, well, sclerotized, it, is, smooth, and, has, neither, dorsal, nor, lateral, keels, ridges, at, the, tip, of, the, abdomen, is, a, pair, of, long, cerci, paired, appendages, on, rearmost, segment, and, in, females, the, ovipositor, is, cylindrical, long, and, narrow, smooth, and, shiny, the, femora, third, segments, of, the, back, pair, of, legs, are, greatly, enlarged, for, jumping, the, tibiae, fourth, segments, of, the, hind, legs, are, armed, with, a, number, of, moveable, spurs, the, arrangement, of, which, is, characteristic, of, each, species, the, tibiae, of, the, front, legs, bear, one, or, more, tympani, which, are, used, for, the, reception, of, sound, the, wings, lie, flat, on, the, body, and, are, very, variable, in, size, between, species, being, reduced, in, size, in, some, crickets, and, missing, in, others, the, fore, wings, are, elytra, made, of, tough, chitin, acting, as, a, protective, shield, for, the, soft, parts, of, the, body, and, in, males, bear, the, stridulatory, organs, for, the, production, of, sound, the, hind, pair, is, membranous, folding, fan, wise, under, the, fore, wings, in, many, species, the, wings, are, not, adapted, for, flight, the, largest, members, of, the, family, are, the, 5, cm, 2, in, long, bull, crickets, brachytrupes, which, excavate, burrows, a, metre, or, more, deep, the, tree, crickets, oecanthinae, are, delicate, white, or, pale, green, insects, with, transparent, fore, wings, while, the, field, crickets, gryllinae, are, robust, brown, or, black, insects, crickets, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, being, found, in, all, parts, of, the, world, with, the, exception, of, cold, regions, at, latitudes, higher, than, about, 55, north, and, south, they, have, colonised, many, large, and, small, islands, sometimes, flying, over, the, sea, to, reach, these, locations, or, perhaps, conveyed, on, floating, timber, or, by, human, activity, the, greatest, diversity, occurs, in, tropical, locations, such, as, in, malaysia, where, 88, species, were, heard, chirping, from, a, single, location, near, kuala, lumpur, a, greater, number, than, this, could, have, been, present, because, some, species, are, mute, crickets, are, found, in, many, habitats, members, of, several, subfamilies, are, found, in, the, upper, tree, canopy, in, bushes, and, among, grasses, and, herbs, they, also, occur, on, the, ground, and, in, caves, and, some, are, subterranean, excavating, shallow, or, deep, burrows, some, make, home, in, rotting, wood, and, certain, beach, dwelling, species, can, run, and, jump, over, the, surface, of, water, crickets, are, relatively, defenceless, soft, bodied, insects, most, species, are, nocturnal, and, spend, the, day, hidden, in, cracks, under, bark, inside, curling, leaves, under, stones, or, fallen, logs, in, leaf, litter, or, in, the, cracks, in, the, ground, that, develop, in, dry, weather, some, excavate, their, own, shallow, holes, in, rotting, wood, or, underground, and, fold, in, their, antennae, to, conceal, their, presence, some, of, these, burrows, are, temporary, shelters, used, for, a, single, day, but, others, serve, as, more, permanent, residences, and, places, for, mating, and, laying, eggs, crickets, burrow, by, loosening, the, soil, with, the, mandibles, and, then, carrying, it, with, the, limbs, flicking, it, backwards, with, the, hind, legs, or, pushing, it, with, the, head, other, defensive, strategies, are, the, use, of, camouflage, fleeing, and, aggression, some, species, have, adopted, colourings, shapes, and, patterns, that, make, it, difficult, for, predators, that, hunt, by, sight, to, detect, them, they, tend, to, be, dull, shades, of, brown, grey, and, green, that, blend, into, their, background, and, desert, species, tend, to, be, pale, some, species, can, fly, but, the, mode, of, flight, tends, to, be, clumsy, so, the, most, usual, response, to, danger, is, to, scuttle, away, to, find, a, hiding, place, while, some, crickets, have, a, weak, bite, a, member, of, the, gryllacrididae, or, raspy, crickets, from, australia, were, found, to, have, the, strongest, bite, of, any, insect, most, male, crickets, make, a, loud, chirping, sound, by, stridulation, scraping, two, specially, textured, body, parts, together, the, stridulatory, organ, is, located, on, the, tegmen, or, fore, wing, which, is, leathery, in, texture, a, large, vein, runs, along, the, centre, of, each, tegmen, with, comb, like, serrations, on, its, edge, forming, a, file, like, structure, and, at, the, rear, edge, of, the, tegmen, is, a, scraper, the, tegmina, are, held, at, an, angle, to, the, body, and, rhythmically, raised, and, lowered, which, causes, the, scraper, on, one, wing, to, rasp, on, the, file, on, the, other, the, central, part, of, the, tegmen, contains, the, harp, an, area, of, thick, sclerotized, membrane, which, resonates, and, amplifies, the, volume, of, sound, as, does, the, pocket, of, air, between, the, tegmina, and, the, body, wall, most, female, crickets, lack, the, necessary, adaptations, to, stridulate, so, make, no, sound, several, types, of, cricket, songs, are, in, the, repertoire, of, some, species, the, calling, song, attracts, females, and, repels, other, males, and, is, fairly, loud, the, courting, song, is, used, when, a, female, cricket, is, near, and, encourages, her, to, mate, with, the, caller, a, triumphal, song, is, produced, for, a, brief, period, after, a, successful, mating, and, may, reinforce, the, mating, bond, to, encourage, the, female, to, lay, some, eggs, rather, than, find, another, male, an, aggressive, song, is, triggered, by, contact, chemoreceptors, on, the, antennae, that, detect, the, presence, of, another, male, cricket, crickets, chirp, at, different, rates, depending, on, their, species, and, the, temperature, of, their, environment, most, species, chirp, at, higher, rates, the, higher, the, temperature, is, about, 62, chirps, a, minute, at, 13, c, 55, f, in, one, common, species, each, species, has, its, own, rate, the, relationship, between, temperature, and, the, rate, of, chirping, is, known, as, dolbear, s, law, according, to, this, law, counting, the, number, of, chirps, produced, in, 14, seconds, by, the, snowy, tree, cricket, common, in, the, united, states, and, adding, 40, will, approximate, the, temperature, in, degrees, fahrenheit, in, 1975, dr, william, h, cade, discovered, that, the, parasitic, tachinid, fly, ormia, ochracea, is, attracted, to, the, song, of, the, cricket, and, uses, it, to, locate, the, male, to, deposit, her, larvae, on, him, it, was, the, first, known, example, of, a, natural, enemy, that, locates, its, host, or, prey, using, the, mating, signal, since, then, many, species, of, crickets, have, been, found, to, be, carrying, the, same, parasitic, fly, or, related, species, in, response, to, this, selective, pressure, a, mutation, leaving, males, unable, to, chirp, was, observed, amongst, a, population, of, teleogryllus, oceanicus, on, the, hawaiian, island, of, kauai, enabling, these, crickets, to, elude, their, parasitoid, predators, a, different, mutation, with, the, same, effect, was, also, discovered, on, the, neighboring, island, of, oahu, ca, 100, miles, 160, km, away, recently, new, purring, males, of, the, same, species, in, hawaii, are, able, to, produce, a, novel, auditory, sexual, signal, that, can, be, used, to, attract, females, while, greatly, reducing, the, likelihood, of, parasitoid, attack, from, the, fly, some, species, such, as, the, ground, crickets, nemobiinae, are, wingless, others, have, small, fore, wings, and, no, hind, wings, copholandrevus, others, lack, hind, wings, and, have, shortened, fore, wings, in, females, only, while, others, are, macropterous, with, the, hind, wings, longer, than, the, fore, wings, in, teleogryllus, the, proportion, of, macropterous, individuals, varies, from, very, low, to, 100, probably, most, species, with, hind, wings, longer, than, fore, wings, engage, in, flight, some, species, such, as, gryllus, assimilis, take, off, fly, and, land, efficiently, and, well, while, other, species, are, clumsy, fliers, in, some, species, the, hind, wings, are, shed, leaving, wing, stumps, usually, after, dispersal, of, the, insect, by, flight, in, other, species, they, may, be, pulled, off, and, consumed, by, the, cricket, itself, or, by, another, individual, probably, providing, a, nutritional, boost, gryllus, firmus, exhibits, wing, polymorphism, some, individuals, have, fully, functional, long, hind, wings, and, others, have, short, wings, and, cannot, fly, the, short, winged, females, have, smaller, flight, muscles, greater, ovarian, development, and, produce, more, eggs, so, the, polymorphism, adapts, the, cricket, for, either, dispersal, or, reproduction, in, some, long, winged, individuals, the, flight, muscles, deteriorate, during, adulthood, and, the, insect, s, reproductive, capabilities, improve, captive, crickets, are, omnivorous, when, deprived, of, their, natural, diet, they, accept, a, wide, range, of, organic, foodstuffs, some, species, are, completely, herbivorous, feeding, on, flowers, fruit, and, leaves, with, ground, based, species, consuming, seedlings, grasses, pieces, of, leaf, and, the, shoots, of, young, plants, others, are, more, predatory, and, include, in, their, diet, invertebrate, eggs, larvae, pupae, moulting, insects, scale, insects, and, aphids, many, are, scavengers, and, consume, various, organic, remains, decaying, plants, seedlings, and, fungi, in, captivity, many, species, have, been, successfully, raised, on, a, diet, of, ground, commercial, dry, dog, food, supplemented, with, lettuce, and, aphids, crickets, have, relatively, powerful, jaws, and, several, species, have, been, known, to, bite, humans, male, crickets, establish, their, dominance, over, each, other, by, aggression, they, start, by, lashing, each, other, with, their, antennae, and, flaring, their, mandibles, unless, one, retreats, at, this, stage, they, resort, to, grappling, at, the, same, time, each, emitting, calls, that, are, quite, unlike, those, uttered, in, other, circumstances, when, one, achieves, dominance, it, sings, loudly, while, the, loser, remains, silent, females, are, generally, attracted, to, males, by, their, calls, though, in, nonstridulatory, species, some, other, mechanism, must, be, involved, after, the, pair, has, made, antennal, contact, a, courtship, period, may, occur, during, which, the, character, of, the, call, changes, the, female, mounts, the, male, and, a, single, spermatophore, is, transferred, to, the, external, genitalia, of, the, female, sperm, flows, from, this, into, the, female, s, oviduct, over, a, period, of, a, few, minutes, or, up, to, an, hour, depending, on, species, after, copulation, the, female, may, remove, or, eat, the, spermatophore, males, may, attempt, to, prevent, this, with, various, ritualised, behaviours, the, female, may, mate, on, several, occasions, with, different, males, most, crickets, lay, their, eggs, in, the, soil, or, inside, the, stems, of, plants, and, to, do, this, female, crickets, have, a, long, needle, like, or, sabre, like, egg, laying, organ, called, an, ovipositor, some, ground, dwelling, species, have, dispensed, with, this, either, depositing, their, eggs, in, an, underground, chamber, or, pushing, them, into, the, wall, of, a, burrow, the, short, tailed, cricket, anurogryllus, excavates, a, burrow, with, chambers, and, a, defecating, area, lays, its, eggs, in, a, pile, on, a, chamber, floor, and, after, the, eggs, have, hatched, feeds, the, juveniles, for, about, a, month, crickets, are, hemimetabolic, insects, whose, lifecycle, consists, of, an, egg, stage, a, larval, or, nymph, stage, that, increasingly, resembles, the, adult, form, as, the, nymph, grows, and, an, adult, stage, the, egg, hatches, into, a, nymph, about, the, size, of, a, fruit, fly, this, passes, through, about, 10, larval, stages, and, with, each, successive, moult, it, becomes, more, like, an, adult, after, the, final, moult, the, genitalia, and, wings, are, fully, developed, but, a, period, of, maturation, is, needed, before, the, cricket, is, ready, to, breed, some, species, of, cricket, are, polyandrous, in, gryllus, bimaculatus, the, females, select, and, mate, with, multiple, viable, sperm, donors, preferring, novel, mates, female, teleogryllus, oceanicus, crickets, from, natural, populations, similarly, mate, and, store, sperm, from, multiple, males, female, crickets, exert, a, postcopulatory, fertilization, bias, in, favour, of, unrelated, males, to, avoid, the, genetic, consequences, of, inbreeding, fertilization, bias, depends, on, the, control, of, sperm, transport, to, the, sperm, storage, organs, the, inhibition, of, sperm, storage, by, female, crickets, can, act, as, a, form, of, cryptic, female, choice, to, avoid, the, severe, negative, effects, of, inbreeding, controlled, breeding, experiments, with, the, cricket, gryllus, firmus, demonstrated, inbreeding, depression, as, nymphal, weight, and, early, fecundity, declined, substantially, over, the, generations, this, was, caused, as, expected, by, an, increased, frequency, of, homozygous, combinations, of, deleterious, recessive, alleles, crickets, have, many, natural, enemies, and, are, subject, to, various, pathogens, and, parasites, they, are, eaten, by, large, numbers, of, vertebrate, and, invertebrate, predators, and, their, hard, parts, are, often, found, during, the, examination, of, animal, intestines, mediterranean, house, geckos, hemidactylus, turcicus, have, learned, that, although, a, calling, decorated, cricket, gryllodes, supplicans, may, be, safely, positioned, in, an, out, of, reach, burrow, female, crickets, attracted, to, the, call, can, be, intercepted, and, eaten, the, entomopathogenic, fungus, metarhizium, anisopliae, attacks, and, kills, crickets, and, has, been, used, as, the, basis, of, control, in, pest, populations, the, insects, are, also, affected, by, the, cricket, paralysis, virus, which, has, caused, high, levels, of, fatalities, in, cricket, rearing, facilities, other, fatal, diseases, that, have, been, identified, in, mass, rearing, establishments, include, rickettsia, and, three, further, viruses, the, diseases, may, spread, more, rapidly, if, the, crickets, become, cannibalistic, and, eat, the, corpses, red, parasitic, mites, sometimes, attach, themselves, to, the, dorsal, region, of, crickets, and, may, greatly, affect, them, the, horsehair, worm, paragordius, varius, is, an, internal, parasite, and, can, control, the, behaviour, of, its, cricket, host, and, cause, it, to, enter, water, where, the, parasite, continues, its, lifecycle, and, the, cricket, likely, drowns, the, larvae, of, the, sarcophagid, fly, sarcophaga, kellyi, develop, inside, the, body, cavity, of, field, crickets, female, parasitic, wasps, of, rhopalosoma, lay, their, eggs, on, crickets, and, their, developing, larvae, gradually, devour, their, hosts, other, wasps, in, the, family, scelionidae, are, egg, parasitoids, seeking, out, batches, of, eggs, laid, by, crickets, in, plant, tissues, in, which, to, insert, their, eggs, the, fly, ormia, ochracea, has, very, acute, hearing, and, targets, calling, male, crickets, it, locates, its, prey, by, ear, and, then, lays, its, eggs, nearby, the, developing, larvae, burrow, inside, any, crickets, with, which, they, come, in, contact, and, in, the, course, of, a, week, or, so, devour, what, remains, of, the, host, before, pupating, in, florida, the, parasitic, flies, were, only, present, in, the, autumn, and, at, that, time, of, year, the, males, sang, less, but, for, longer, periods, a, trade, off, exists, for, the, male, between, attracting, females, and, being, parasitized, the, phylogenetic, relationships, of, the, gryllidae, summarized, by, darryl, gwynne, in, 1995, from, his, own, work, using, mainly, anatomical, characteristics, and, that, of, earlier, authors, are, shown, in, the, following, cladogram, with, the, orthoptera, divided, into, two, main, groups, ensifera, crickets, sensu, lato, and, caelifera, grasshoppers, fossil, ensifera, are, found, from, the, late, carboniferous, period, 300, mya, onwards, and, the, true, crickets, gryllidae, from, the, triassic, period, 250, to, 200, mya, cladogram, after, gwynne, 1995, gryllidae, true, crickets, mole, scaly, and, ant, crickets, schizodactylidae, splay, footed, crickets, tettigonioidea, katydids, bush, crickets, weta, shorthorned, grasshoppers, pygmy, mole, crickets, a, phylogenetic, study, by, jost, shaw, in, 2006, using, sequences, from, 18s, 28s, and, 16s, rrna, supported, the, monophyly, of, ensifera, most, ensiferan, families, were, also, found, to, be, monophyletic, and, the, superfamily, gryllacridoidea, was, found, to, include, stenopelmatidae, anostostomatidae, gryllacrididae, and, lezina, schizodactylidae, and, grylloidea, were, shown, to, be, sister, taxa, and, rhaphidophoridae, and, tettigoniidae, were, found, to, be, more, closely, related, to, grylloidea, than, had, previously, been, thought, the, authors, stated, that, a, high, degree, of, conflict, exists, between, the, molecular, and, morphological, data, possibly, indicating, that, much, homoplasy, is, present, in, ensifera, particularly, in, acoustic, structures, they, considered, that, tegmen, stridulation, and, tibial, tympanae, are, ancestral, to, ensifera, and, have, been, lost, on, multiple, occasions, especially, within, the, gryllidae, several, families, and, other, taxa, in, the, ensifera, may, be, called, crickets, including, the, folklore, and, mythology, surrounding, crickets, is, extensive, the, singing, of, crickets, in, the, folklore, of, brazil, and, elsewhere, is, sometimes, taken, to, be, a, sign, of, impending, rain, or, of, a, financial, windfall, in, lvar, n, ez, cabeza, de, vaca, s, chronicles, of, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, americas, the, sudden, chirping, of, a, cricket, heralded, the, sighting, of, land, for, his, crew, just, as, their, water, supply, had, run, out, in, caraguatatuba, brazil, a, black, cricket, in, a, room, is, said, to, portend, illness, a, grey, one, money, and, a, green, one, hope, in, alagoas, state, northeast, brazil, a, cricket, announces, death, thus, it, is, killed, if, it, chirps, in, a, house, in, barbados, a, loud, cricket, means, money, is, coming, in, hence, a, cricket, must, not, be, killed, or, evicted, if, it, chirps, inside, a, house, however, another, type, of, cricket, that, is, less, noisy, forebodes, illness, or, death, crickets, feature, as, major, characters, in, novels, and, children, s, books, charles, dickens, s, 1845, novella, the, cricket, on, the, hearth, divided, into, sections, called, chirps, tells, the, story, of, a, cricket, which, chirps, on, the, hearth, and, acts, as, a, guardian, angel, to, a, family, carlo, collodi,

cricket, but, also, mentions, the, italian, cricket, crickets, have, from, time, to, time, appeared, in, poetry, william, wordsworth, s, 1805, poem, the, cottager, to, her, infant, includes, the, couplet, the, kitten, sleeps, upon, the, hearth, the, crickets, long, have, ceased, their, mirth, john, keats, s, 1819, poem, ode, to, autumn, includes, the, lines, hedge, crickets, sing, and, now, with, treble, soft, the, redbreast, whistles, from, a, garden, croft, the, chinese, tang, dynasty, poet, du, fu, 712, 770, wrote, a, poem, that, in, the, translation, by, j, p, seaton, begins, house, cricket, trifling, thing, and, yet, how, his, mournful, song, moves, us, out, in, the, grass, his, cry, was, a, tremble, but, now, he, trills, beneath, our, bed, to, share, his, sorrow, crickets, are, kept, as, pets, and, are, considered, good, luck, in, some, countries, in, china, they, are, sometimes, kept, in, cages, or, in, hollowed, out, gourds, specially, created, in, novel, shapes, the, practice, was, common, in, japan, for, thousands, of, years, it, peaked, in, the, 19th, century, though, crickets, are, still, sold, at, pet, shops, it, is, also, common, to, have, them, as, caged, pets, in, some, european, countries, particularly, in, the, iberian, peninsula, cricket, fighting, is, a, traditional, chinese, pastime, that, dates, back, to, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, originally, an, indulgence, of, emperors, cricket, fighting, later, became, popular, among, commoners, the, dominance, and, fighting, ability, of, males, does, not, depend, on, strength, alone, it, has, been, found, that, they, become, more, aggressive, after, certain, pre, fight, experiences, such, as, isolation, or, when, defending, a, refuge, crickets, forced, to, fly, for, a, short, while, will, afterwards, fight, for, two, to, three, times, longer, than, they, otherwise, would, in, the, southern, part, of, asia, including, cambodia, laos, and, thailand, crickets, commonly, are, eaten, as, a, snack, prepared, by, deep, frying, soaked, and, cleaned, insects, in, thailand, there, are, 20, 000, farmers, rearing, crickets, with, an, estimated, production, of, 7, 500, tons, per, year, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, has, implemented, a, project, in, laos, to, improve, cricket, farming, and, consequently, food, security, the, food, conversion, efficiency,
