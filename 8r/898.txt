the, green, algae, sg, green, alga, are, a, group, of, chlorophyll, containing, autotrophic, eukaryotes, consisting, of, the, phylum, prasinodermophyta, and, its, unnamed, sister, group, that, contains, the, chlorophyta, and, charophyta, streptophyta, the, land, plants, embryophytes, have, emerged, deep, in, the, charophyte, alga, as, a, sister, of, the, zygnematophyceae, since, the, realization, that, the, embryophytes, emerged, within, the, green, algae, some, authors, are, starting, to, include, them, the, completed, clade, that, includes, both, green, algae, and, embryophytes, is, monophyletic, and, is, referred, to, as, the, clade, viridiplantae, and, as, the, kingdom, plantae, the, green, algae, include, unicellular, and, colonial, flagellates, most, with, two, flagella, per, cell, as, well, as, various, colonial, coccoid, spherical, and, filamentous, forms, and, macroscopic, multicellular, seaweeds, there, are, about, 22, 000, species, of, green, algae, many, of, which, live, most, of, their, lives, as, single, cells, while, other, species, form, coenobia, colonies, long, filaments, or, highly, differentiated, macroscopic, seaweeds, a, few, other, organisms, rely, on, green, algae, to, conduct, photosynthesis, for, them, the, chloroplasts, in, dinoflagellates, of, the, genus, lepidodinium, euglenids, and, chlorarachniophytes, were, acquired, from, ingested, endosymbiont, green, algae, and, in, the, latter, retain, a, nucleomorph, vestigial, nucleus, green, algae, are, also, found, symbiotically, in, the, ciliate, paramecium, and, in, hydra, viridissima, and, in, flatworms, some, species, of, green, algae, particularly, of, genera, trebouxia, of, the, class, trebouxiophyceae, and, trentepohlia, class, ulvophyceae, can, be, found, in, symbiotic, associations, with, fungi, to, form, lichens, in, general, the, fungal, species, that, partner, in, lichens, cannot, live, on, their, own, while, the, algal, species, is, often, found, living, in, nature, without, the, fungus, trentepohlia, is, a, filamentous, green, alga, that, can, live, independently, on, humid, soil, rocks, or, tree, bark, or, form, the, photosymbiont, in, lichens, of, the, family, graphidaceae, also, the, macroalga, prasiola, calophylla, trebouxiophyceae, is, terrestrial, and, prasiola, crispa, which, live, in, the, supralittoral, zone, is, terrestrial, and, can, in, the, antarctic, form, large, carpets, on, humid, soil, especially, near, bird, colonies, green, algae, have, chloroplasts, that, contain, chlorophyll, a, and, b, giving, them, a, bright, green, colour, as, well, as, the, accessory, pigments, beta, carotene, red, orange, and, xanthophylls, yellow, in, stacked, thylakoids, the, cell, walls, of, green, algae, usually, contain, cellulose, and, they, store, carbohydrate, in, the, form, of, starch, all, green, algae, have, mitochondria, with, flat, cristae, when, present, paired, flagella, are, used, to, move, the, cell, they, are, anchored, by, a, cross, shaped, system, of, microtubules, and, fibrous, strands, flagella, are, only, present, in, the, motile, male, gametes, of, charophytes, bryophytes, pteridophytes, cycads, and, ginkgo, but, are, absent, from, the, gametes, of, pinophyta, and, flowering, plants, members, of, the, class, chlorophyceae, undergo, closed, mitosis, in, the, most, common, form, of, cell, division, among, the, green, algae, which, occurs, via, a, phycoplast, by, contrast, charophyte, green, algae, and, land, plants, embryophytes, undergo, open, mitosis, without, centrioles, instead, a, raft, of, microtubules, the, phragmoplast, is, formed, from, the, mitotic, spindle, and, cell, division, involves, the, use, of, this, phragmoplast, in, the, production, of, a, cell, plate, photosynthetic, eukaryotes, originated, following, a, primary, endosymbiotic, event, where, a, heterotrophic, eukaryotic, cell, engulfed, a, photosynthetic, cyanobacterium, like, prokaryote, that, became, stably, integrated, and, eventually, evolved, into, a, membrane, bound, organelle, the, plastid, this, primary, endosymbiosis, event, gave, rise, to, three, autotrophic, clades, with, primary, plastids, the, green, plants, with, chloroplasts, the, red, algae, with, rhodoplasts, and, the, glaucophytes, with, muroplasts, green, algae, are, often, classified, with, their, embryophyte, descendants, in, the, green, plant, clade, viridiplantae, or, chlorobionta, viridiplantae, together, with, red, algae, and, glaucophyte, algae, form, the, supergroup, primoplantae, also, known, as, archaeplastida, or, plantae, sensu, lato, the, ancestral, green, alga, was, a, unicellular, flagellate, the, viridiplantae, diverged, into, two, clades, the, chlorophyta, include, the, early, diverging, prasinophyte, lineages, and, the, core, chlorophyta, which, contain, the, majority, of, described, species, of, green, algae, the, streptophyta, include, charophytes, and, land, plants, below, is, a, consensus, reconstruction, of, green, algal, relationships, mainly, based, on, molecular, data, palmophyllophyceae, prasinophyte, clade, vi, prasinodermophyceae, ulvophyceae, chlorophyceae, trebouxiophyceae, chlorodendrophyceae, pedinophyceae, prasinophytes, clade, viia, prasinophytes, clade, viic, pycnococcaceae, nephroselmidophyceae, mamiellophyceae, pyramimonadales, mesostigmatophyceae, spirotaenia, chlorokybophyceae, streptofilum, klebsormidiophyceae, charophyceae, coleochaetophyceae, zygnematophyceae, mesotaeniaceae, s, s, embryophyta, land, plants, the, basal, character, of, the, mesostigmatophyceae, chlorokybophyceae, and, spirotaenia, are, only, more, conventionally, basal, streptophytes, the, algae, of, this, paraphyletic, group, charophyta, were, previously, included, in, chlorophyta, so, green, algae, and, chlorophyta, in, this, definition, were, synonyms, as, the, green, algae, clades, get, further, resolved, the, embryophytes, which, are, a, deep, charophyte, branch, are, included, in, algae, green, algae, and, charophytes, or, these, terms, are, replaced, by, cladistic, terminology, such, as, archaeplastida, plantae, viridiplantae, and, streptophytes, respectively, green, algae, are, a, group, of, photosynthetic, eukaryotic, organisms, that, include, species, with, haplobiontic, and, diplobiontic, life, cycles, the, diplobiontic, species, such, as, ulva, follow, a, reproductive, cycle, called, alternation, of, generations, in, which, two, multicellular, forms, haploid, and, diploid, alternate, and, these, may, or, may, not, be, isomorphic, having, the, same, morphology, in, haplobiontic, species, only, the, haploid, generation, the, gametophyte, is, multicellular, the, fertilized, egg, cell, the, diploid, zygote, undergoes, meiosis, giving, rise, to, haploid, cells, which, will, become, new, gametophytes, the, diplobiontic, forms, which, evolved, from, haplobiontic, ancestors, have, both, a, multicellular, haploid, generation, and, a, multicellular, diploid, generation, here, the, zygote, divides, repeatedly, by, mitosis, and, grows, into, a, multicellular, diploid, sporophyte, the, sporophyte, produces, haploid, spores, by, meiosis, that, germinate, to, produce, a, multicellular, gametophyte, all, land, plants, have, a, diplobiontic, common, ancestor, and, diplobiontic, forms, have, also, evolved, independently, within, ulvophyceae, more, than, once, as, has, also, occurred, in, the, red, and, brown, algae, diplobiontic, green, algae, include, isomorphic, and, heteromorphic, forms, in, isomorphic, algae, the, morphology, is, identical, in, the, haploid, and, diploid, generations, in, heteromorphic, algae, the, morphology, and, size, are, different, in, the, gametophyte, and, sporophyte, reproduction, varies, from, fusion, of, identical, cells, isogamy, to, fertilization, of, a, large, non, motile, cell, by, a, smaller, motile, one, oogamy, however, these, traits, show, some, variation, most, notably, among, the, basal, green, algae, called, prasinophytes, haploid, algal, cells, containing, only, one, copy, of, their, dna, can, fuse, with, other, haploid, cells, to, form, diploid, zygotes, when, filamentous, algae, do, this, they, form, bridges, between, cells, and, leave, empty, cell, walls, behind, that, can, be, easily, distinguished, under, the, light, microscope, this, process, is, called, conjugation, and, occurs, for, example, in, spirogyra, sex, pheromone, production, is, likely, a, common, feature, of, green, algae, although, only, studied, in, detail, in, a, few, model, organisms, volvox, is, a, genus, of, chlorophytes, different, species, form, spherical, colonies, of, up, to, 50, 000, cells, one, well, studied, species, volvox, carteri, 2, 000, 6, 000, cells, occupies, temporary, pools, of, water, that, tend, to, dry, out, in, the, heat, of, late, summer, as, their, environment, dries, out, asexual, v, carteri, quickly, die, however, they, are, able, to, escape, death, by, switching, shortly, before, drying, is, complete, to, the, sexual, phase, of, their, life, cycle, that, leads, to, production, of, dormant, desiccation, resistant, zygotes, sexual, development, is, initiated, by, a, glycoprotein, pheromone, hallmann, et, al, 1998, this, pheromone, is, one, of, the, most, potent, known, biological, effector, molecules, it, can, trigger, sexual, development, at, concentrations, as, low, as, 10, 16, m, kirk, and, kirk, showed, that, sex, inducing, pheromone, production, can, be, triggered, experimentally, in, somatic, cells, by, heat, shock, thus, heat, shock, may, be, a, condition, that, ordinarily, triggers, sex, inducing, pheromone, in, nature, the, closterium, peracerosum, strigosum, littorale, c, psl, complex, is, a, unicellular, isogamous, charophycean, alga, group, that, is, the, closest, unicellular, relative, to, land, plants, heterothallic, strains, of, different, mating, type, can, conjugate, to, form, zygospores, sex, pheromones, termed, protoplast, release, inducing, proteins, glycopolypeptides, produced, by, mating, type, and, mating, type, cells, facilitate, this, process, the, green, algae, including, the, characean, algae, have, served, as, model, experimental, organisms, to, understand, the, mechanisms, of, the, ionic, and, water, permeability, of, membranes, osmoregulation, turgor, regulation, salt, tolerance, cytoplasmic, streaming, and, the, generation, of, action, potentials
