the, epidermis, from, the, greek, meaning, over, skin, is, a, single, layer, of, cells, that, covers, the, leaves, flowers, roots, and, stems, of, plants, it, forms, a, boundary, between, the, plant, and, the, external, environment, the, epidermis, serves, several, functions, it, protects, against, water, loss, regulates, gas, exchange, secretes, metabolic, compounds, and, especially, in, roots, absorbs, water, and, mineral, nutrients, the, epidermis, of, most, leaves, shows, dorsoventral, anatomy, the, upper, adaxial, and, lower, abaxial, surfaces, have, somewhat, different, construction, and, may, serve, different, functions, woody, stems, and, some, other, stem, structures, such, as, potato, tubers, produce, a, secondary, covering, called, the, periderm, that, replaces, the, epidermis, as, the, protective, covering, the, epidermis, is, the, outermost, cell, layer, of, the, primary, plant, body, in, some, older, works, the, cells, of, the, leaf, epidermis, have, been, regarded, as, specialized, parenchyma, cells, but, the, established, modern, preference, has, long, been, to, classify, the, epidermis, as, dermal, tissue, whereas, parenchyma, is, classified, as, ground, tissue, the, epidermis, is, the, main, component, of, the, dermal, tissue, system, of, leaves, diagrammed, below, and, also, stems, roots, flowers, fruits, and, seeds, it, is, usually, transparent, epidermal, cells, have, fewer, chloroplasts, or, lack, them, completely, except, for, the, guard, cells, the, cells, of, the, epidermis, are, structurally, and, functionally, variable, most, plants, have, an, epidermis, that, is, a, single, cell, layer, thick, some, plants, like, ficus, elastica, and, peperomia, which, have, a, periclinal, cellular, division, within, the, protoderm, of, the, leaves, have, an, epidermis, with, multiple, cell, layers, epidermal, cells, are, tightly, linked, to, each, other, and, provide, mechanical, strength, and, protection, to, the, plant, particularly, wavy, pavement, cells, are, suggested, to, play, a, pivotal, role, in, preventing, or, guiding, cracks, in, the, epidermis, the, walls, of, the, epidermal, cells, of, the, above, ground, parts, of, plants, contain, cutin, and, are, covered, with, a, cuticle, the, cuticle, reduces, water, loss, to, the, atmosphere, it, is, sometimes, covered, with, wax, in, smooth, sheets, granules, plates, tubes, or, filaments, the, wax, layers, give, some, plants, a, whitish, or, bluish, surface, color, surface, wax, acts, as, a, moisture, barrier, and, protects, the, plant, from, intense, sunlight, and, wind, the, epidermal, tissue, includes, several, differentiated, cell, types, epidermal, cells, guard, cells, subsidiary, cells, and, epidermal, hairs, trichomes, the, epidermal, cells, are, the, most, numerous, largest, and, least, specialized, these, are, typically, more, elongated, in, the, leaves, of, monocots, than, in, those, of, dicots, trichomes, or, hairs, grow, out, from, the, epidermis, in, many, species, in, the, root, epidermis, epidermal, hairs, termed, root, hairs, are, common, and, are, specialized, for, the, absorption, of, water, and, mineral, nutrients, in, plants, with, secondary, growth, the, epidermis, of, roots, and, stems, is, usually, replaced, by, a, periderm, through, the, action, of, a, cork, cambium, the, leaf, and, stem, epidermis, is, covered, with, pores, called, stomata, sing, stoma, part, of, a, stoma, complex, consisting, of, a, pore, surrounded, on, each, side, by, chloroplast, containing, guard, cells, and, two, to, four, subsidiary, cells, that, lack, chloroplasts, the, stomata, complex, regulates, the, exchange, of, gases, and, water, vapor, between, the, outside, air, and, the, interior, of, the, leaf, typically, the, stomata, are, more, numerous, over, the, abaxial, lower, epidermis, of, the, leaf, than, the, adaxial, upper, epidermis, an, exception, is, floating, leaves, where, most, or, all, stomata, are, on, the, upper, surface, vertical, leaves, such, as, those, of, many, grasses, often, have, roughly, equal, numbers, of, stomata, on, both, surfaces, the, stoma, is, bounded, by, two, guard, cells, the, guard, cells, differ, from, the, epidermal, cells, in, the, following, aspects, at, night, the, sugar, is, used, up, and, water, leaves, the, guard, cells, so, they, become, flaccid, and, the, stomatal, pore, closes, in, this, way, they, reduce, the, amount, of, water, vapor, escaping, from, the, leaf, the, plant, epidermis, consists, of, three, main, cell, types, pavement, cells, guard, cells, and, their, subsidiary, cells, that, surround, the, stomata, and, trichomes, otherwise, known, as, leaf, hairs, the, epidermis, of, petals, also, form, a, variation, of, trichomes, called, conical, cells, trichomes, develop, at, a, distinct, phase, during, leaf, development, under, the, control, of, two, major, trichome, specification, genes, ttg, and, gl1, the, process, may, be, controlled, by, the, plant, hormones, gibberellins, and, even, if, not, completely, controlled, gibberellins, certainly, have, an, effect, on, the, development, of, the, leaf, hairs, gl1, causes, endoreplication, the, replication, of, dna, without, subsequent, cell, division, as, well, as, cell, expansion, gl1, turns, on, the, expression, of, a, second, gene, for, trichome, formation, gl2, which, controls, the, final, stages, of, trichome, formation, causing, the, cellular, outgrowth, arabidopsis, thaliana, uses, the, products, of, inhibitory, genes, to, control, the, patterning, of, trichomes, such, as, ttg, and, try, the, products, of, these, genes, will, diffuse, into, the, lateral, cells, preventing, them, from, forming, trichomes, and, in, the, case, of, try, promoting, the, formation, of, pavement, cells, expression, of, the, gene, mixta, or, its, analogue, in, other, species, later, in, the, process, of, cellular, differentiation, will, cause, the, formation, of, conical, cells, over, trichomes, mixta, is, a, transcription, factor, stomatal, patterning, is, a, much, more, controlled, process, as, the, stoma, affects, the, plant, s, water, retention, and, respiration, capabilities, as, a, consequence, of, these, important, functions, differentiation, of, cells, to, form, stomata, is, also, subject, to, environmental, conditions, to, a, much, greater, degree, than, other, epidermal, cell, types, stomata, are, pores, in, the, plant, epidermis, that, are, surrounded, by, two, guard, cells, which, control, the, opening, and, closing, of, the, aperture, these, guard, cells, are, in, turn, surrounded, by, subsidiary, cells, which, provide, a, supporting, role, for, the, guard, cells, stomata, begin, as, stomatal, meristemoids, the, process, differs, between, dicots, and, monocots, spacing, is, thought, to, be, essentially, random, in, dicots, though, mutants, do, show, it, is, under, some, form, of, genetic, control, but, it, is, more, controlled, in, monocots, where, stomata, arise, from, specific, asymmetric, divisions, of, protoderm, cells, the, smaller, of, the, two, cells, produced, becomes, the, guard, mother, cells, adjacent, epidermal, cells, will, also, divide, asymmetrically, to, form, the, subsidiary, cells, because, stomata, play, such, an, important, role, in, the, plants, survival, collecting, information, on, their, differentiation, is, difficult, by, the, traditional, means, of, genetic, manipulation, as, stomatal, mutants, tend, to, be, unable, to, survive, thus, the, control, of, the, process, is, not, well, understood, some, genes, have, been, identified, tmm, is, thought, to, control, the, timing, of, stomatal, initiation, specification, and, flp, is, thought, to, be, involved, in, preventing, the, further, division, of, the, guard, cells, once, they, are, formed, environmental, conditions, affect, the, development, of, stomata, in, particular, their, density, on, the, leaf, surface, it, is, thought, that, plant, hormones, such, as, ethylene, and, cytokines, control, the, stomatal, developmental, response, to, the, environmental, conditions, accumulation, of, these, hormones, appears, to, cause, increased, stomatal, density, such, as, when, the, plants, are, kept, in, closed, environments
