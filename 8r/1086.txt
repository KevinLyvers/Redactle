quinoa, chenopodium, quinoa, k, i, n, w, k, i, n, o, from, quechua, kinwa, or, kinuwa, is, a, flowering, plant, in, the, amaranth, family, it, is, a, herbaceous, annual, plant, grown, as, a, crop, primarily, for, its, edible, seeds, the, seeds, are, rich, in, protein, dietary, fiber, b, vitamins, and, dietary, minerals, in, amounts, greater, than, in, many, grains, quinoa, is, not, a, grass, but, rather, a, pseudocereal, botanically, related, to, spinach, and, amaranth, amaranthus, spp, and, originated, in, the, andean, region, of, northwestern, south, america, it, was, first, used, to, feed, livestock, 5, 200, 7, 000, years, ago, and, for, human, consumption, 3, 000, 4, 000, years, ago, in, the, lake, titicaca, basin, of, peru, and, bolivia, the, plant, thrives, at, high, elevations, and, produces, seeds, that, are, rich, in, protein, almost, all, production, in, the, andean, region, is, done, by, small, farms, and, associations, its, cultivation, has, spread, to, more, than, 70, countries, including, kenya, india, the, united, states, and, european, countries, as, a, result, of, increased, popularity, and, consumption, in, north, america, europe, and, australasia, quinoa, crop, prices, tripled, between, 2006, and, 2014, the, species, chenopodium, quinoa, was, first, described, by, carl, ludwig, willdenow, 1765, 1812, a, german, botanist, who, studied, plants, from, south, america, brought, back, by, explorers, alexander, von, humboldt, and, aim, bonpland, the, genus, name, chenopodium, is, composed, of, two, words, coming, from, the, greek, goose, and, podion, little, foot, or, goose, foot, because, of, the, resemblance, of, the, leaves, with, the, trace, of, a, goose, s, foot, the, specific, epithet, quinoa, is, a, borrowing, from, the, spanish, quinua, or, quinoa, itself, derived, from, quechua, kinuwa, the, incas, nicknamed, quinoa, chisiya, mama, which, in, quechua, means, mother, of, all, grains, chenopodium, quinoa, is, a, dicotyledonous, annual, plant, usually, about, 1, 2, m, 3, 7, ft, high, it, has, broad, generally, powdery, hairy, lobed, leaves, normally, arranged, alternately, the, woody, central, stem, is, branched, or, unbranched, depending, on, the, variety, and, may, be, green, red, or, purple, the, flowering, panicles, arise, from, the, top, of, the, plant, or, from, leaf, axils, along, the, stem, each, panicle, has, a, central, axis, from, which, a, secondary, axis, emerges, either, with, flowers, amaranthiform, or, bearing, a, tertiary, axis, carrying, the, flowers, glomeruliform, these, are, small, incomplete, sessile, flowers, of, the, same, colour, as, the, sepals, and, both, pistillate, and, perfect, forms, occur, pistillate, flowers, are, generally, located, at, the, proximal, end, of, the, glomeruli, and, the, perfect, ones, at, the, distal, end, of, it, a, perfect, flower, has, five, sepals, five, anthers, and, a, superior, ovary, from, which, two, to, three, stigmatic, branches, emerge, the, green, hypogynous, flowers, have, a, simple, perianth, and, are, generally, self, fertilizing, though, cross, pollination, occurs, in, the, natural, environment, betalains, serve, to, attract, animals, to, generate, a, greater, rate, of, pollination, and, ensure, or, improve, seed, dissemination, the, fruits, seeds, are, about, 2, mm, 1, 16, in, in, diameter, and, of, various, colors, from, white, to, red, or, black, depending, on, the, cultivar, in, regards, to, the, newly, developed, salinity, resistance, of, c, quinoa, some, studies, have, concluded, that, accumulation, of, organic, osmolytes, plays, a, dual, role, for, the, species, they, provide, osmotic, adjustment, in, addition, to, protection, against, oxidative, stress, of, the, photosynthetic, structures, in, developing, leaves, studies, also, suggested, that, reduction, in, stomatal, density, in, reaction, to, salinity, levels, represents, an, essential, instrument, of, defence, to, optimize, water, use, efficiency, under, the, given, conditions, to, which, it, may, be, exposed, chenopodium, quinoa, is, believed, to, have, been, domesticated, in, the, peruvian, andes, from, wild, or, weed, populations, of, the, same, species, there, are, non, cultivated, quinoa, plants, chenopodium, quinoa, var, melanospermum, that, grow, in, the, area, it, is, cultivated, these, may, either, be, related, to, wild, predecessors, or, they, could, be, descendants, of, cultivated, plants, raw, uncooked, quinoa, is, 13, water, 64, carbohydrates, 14, protein, and, 6, fat, nutritional, evaluations, indicate, that, a, 100, g, 3, 1, 2, oz, serving, of, raw, quinoa, seeds, has, a, food, energy, of, 1, 539, kj, 368, kcal, and, is, a, rich, source, 20, or, higher, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, protein, dietary, fiber, several, b, vitamins, including, 46, dv, for, folate, and, for, several, dietary, minerals, such, as, magnesium, 55, dv, manganese, 95, dv, phosphorus, 65, dv, and, zinc, 33, dv, table, after, boiling, which, is, the, typical, preparation, for, eating, the, seeds, many, nutritional, evaluations, change, although, a, 100, g, 3, 1, 2, oz, serving, of, cooked, quinoa, increases, to, 72, water, most, nutritional, evaluations, are, reduced, such, as, 21, carbohydrates, 4, protein, and, 2, fat, and, the, food, energy, of, cooked, quinoa, is, reduced, to, 503, kj, 120, kcal, although, similarly, reduced, cooked, quinoa, remains, a, rich, source, of, the, dietary, minerals, manganese, 30, dv, and, phosphorus, 22, dv, however, cooked, quinoa, is, reduced, to, being, just, a, moderate, source, 10, 19, dv, of, dietary, fiber, and, folate, 11, as, well, as, of, the, dietary, minerals, iron, 11, magnesium, 18, and, zinc, 11, table, quinoa, is, gluten, free, because, quinoa, has, a, high, concentration, of, protein, and, is, a, good, source, of, many, micronutrients, has, versatility, in, preparation, and, a, potential, for, increased, yields, in, controlled, environments, it, has, been, selected, as, an, experimental, crop, in, nasa, s, controlled, ecological, life, support, system, for, long, duration, human, occupied, space, flights, besides, its, food, properties, quinoa, has, several, medical, uses, among, which, antimicrobial, and, anticancer, properties, are, promising, in, their, natural, state, the, seeds, have, a, coating, that, contains, bitter, tasting, saponins, making, them, unpalatable, most, of, the, grain, sold, commercially, has, been, processed, to, remove, this, coating, this, bitterness, has, beneficial, effects, during, cultivation, as, it, deters, birds, and, therefore, the, plant, requires, minimal, protection, the, genetic, control, of, bitterness, involves, quantitative, inheritance, although, lowering, the, saponin, content, through, selective, breeding, to, produce, sweeter, more, palatable, varieties, is, complicated, by, 10, cross, pollination, it, is, a, major, goal, of, quinoa, breeding, programs, which, may, include, genetic, engineering, the, toxicity, category, rating, of, the, saponins, in, quinoa, treats, them, as, mild, eye, and, respiratory, irritants, and, as, a, low, gastrointestinal, irritant, in, south, america, these, saponins, have, many, uses, including, as, a, detergent, for, clothing, and, washing, and, as, a, folk, medicine, antiseptic, for, skin, injuries, additionally, the, leaves, and, stems, of, all, species, of, the, genus, chenopodium, and, related, genera, of, the, family, amaranthaceae, including, quinoa, contain, high, levels, of, oxalic, acid, the, plant, s, growth, is, highly, variable, due, to, the, number, of, different, subspecies, varieties, and, landraces, domesticated, plants, or, animals, adapted, to, the, environment, in, which, they, originated, however, it, is, generally, undemanding, and, altitude, hardy, it, is, grown, from, coastal, regions, to, over, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, in, the, andes, near, the, equator, with, most, of, the, cultivars, being, grown, between, 2, 500, m, 8, 200, ft, and, 4, 000, m, 13, 000, ft, depending, on, the, variety, optimal, growing, conditions, are, in, cool, climates, with, temperatures, that, vary, between, 4, c, 25, f, during, the, night, to, near, 35, c, 95, f, during, the, day, some, cultivars, can, withstand, lower, temperatures, without, damage, light, frosts, normally, do, not, affect, the, plants, at, any, stage, of, development, except, during, flowering, midsummer, frosts, during, flowering, a, frequent, occurrence, in, the, andes, lead, to, sterilization, of, the, pollen, rainfall, requirements, are, highly, variable, between, the, different, cultivars, ranging, from, 300, to, 1, 000, mm, 12, to, 39, in, during, the, growing, season, growth, is, optimal, with, well, distributed, rainfall, during, early, growth, and, no, rain, during, seed, maturation, and, harvesting, quinoa, has, been, cultivated, in, the, united, states, primarily, in, the, high, elevation, san, luis, valley, of, colorado, where, it, was, introduced, in, 1983, in, this, high, altitude, desert, valley, maximum, summer, temperatures, rarely, exceed, 30, c, 86, f, and, night, temperatures, are, about, 7, c, 45, f, in, the, 2010s, experimental, production, was, attempted, in, the, palouse, region, of, eastern, washington, and, farmers, in, western, washington, began, producing, the, crop, the, washington, state, university, skagit, river, valley, research, facility, near, mount, vernon, grew, thousands, of, its, own, experimental, varieties, the, puget, sound, region, s, climate, is, similar, to, that, of, coastal, chile, where, the, crop, has, been, grown, for, centuries, due, to, the, short, growing, season, north, american, cultivation, requires, short, maturity, varieties, typically, of, bolivian, origin, quinoa, is, planted, in, idaho, where, a, variety, developed, and, bred, specifically, for, the, high, altitude, snake, river, plain, is, the, largest, planted, variety, in, north, america, several, countries, within, europe, have, successfully, grown, quinoa, on, a, commercial, scale, quinoa, plants, do, best, in, sandy, well, drained, soils, with, a, low, nutrient, content, moderate, salinity, and, a, soil, ph, of, 6, to, 8, 5, the, seedbed, must, be, well, prepared, and, drained, to, avoid, waterlogging, quinoa, has, gained, attention, for, its, adaptability, to, contrasting, environments, such, as, saline, soils, nutrient, poor, soils, and, drought, stressed, marginal, agroecosystems, yields, are, maximised, when, 170, 200, kg, ha, 150, 180, lb, acre, of, nitrogen, is, available, the, addition, of, phosphorus, does, not, improve, yield, in, eastern, north, america, it, is, susceptible, to, a, leaf, miner, that, may, reduce, crop, success, the, miner, also, affects, the, common, weed, and, close, relative, chenopodium, album, but, c, album, is, much, more, resistant, rotation, is, used, in, its, andean, native, range, rotation, is, common, with, potato, cereals, and, legumes, including, lupinus, mutabilis, the, genome, of, quinoa, was, sequenced, in, 2017, through, traditional, selective, breeding, and, potentially, genetic, engineering, the, plant, is, being, modified, to, have, higher, crop, yield, improved, tolerance, to, heat, and, biotic, stress, and, greater, sweetness, through, saponin, inhibition, traditionally, quinoa, grain, is, harvested, by, hand, and, only, rarely, by, machine, because, the, extreme, variability, of, the, maturity, period, of, most, quinoa, cultivars, complicates, mechanization, harvest, needs, to, be, precisely, timed, to, avoid, high, seed, losses, from, shattering, and, different, panicles, on, the, same, plant, mature, at, different, times, the, crop, yield, in, the, andean, region, often, around, 3, t, ha, up, to, 5, t, ha, is, comparable, to, wheat, yields, in, the, united, states, varieties, have, been, selected, for, uniformity, of, maturity, and, are, mechanically, harvested, using, conventional, small, grain, combines, the, plants, are, allowed, to, stand, until, the, stalks, and, seeds, have, dried, out, and, the, grain, has, reached, a, moisture, content, below, 10, handling, involves, threshing, the, seedheads, from, the, chaff, and, winnowing, the, seed, to, remove, the, husk, before, storage, the, seeds, need, to, be, dried, in, order, to, avoid, germination, dry, seeds, can, be, stored, raw, until, being, washed, or, mechanically, processed, to, remove, the, pericarp, to, eliminate, the, bitter, layer, containing, saponins, this, was, traditionally, done, manually, which, is, labour, intensive, the, seeds, must, be, dried, again, before, being, stored, and, sold, in, stores, in, 2020, world, production, of, quinoa, was, 175, 188, tonnes, led, by, peru, and, bolivia, with, 97, of, the, total, when, combined, table, since, the, early, 21st, century, when, quinoa, became, more, commonly, consumed, in, north, america, europe, and, australasia, where, it, was, not, typically, grown, the, crop, value, increased, between, 2006, and, 2013, quinoa, crop, prices, tripled, in, 2011, the, average, price, was, us, 3, 115, per, tonne, with, some, varieties, selling, as, high, as, 8, 000, per, tonne, this, compares, with, wheat, prices, of, about, us, 340, per, tonne, making, wheat, about, 10, of, the, value, of, quinoa, the, resulting, effect, on, traditional, production, regions, in, peru, and, bolivia, also, influenced, new, commercial, quinoa, production, elsewhere, in, the, world, such, as, the, united, states, 176, by, 2013, quinoa, was, being, cultivated, in, some, 70, countries, as, a, result, of, expanding, production, outside, the, andean, highlands, native, for, quinoa, the, price, plummeted, starting, in, early, 2015, and, remained, low, for, years, from, 2018, to, 2019, quinoa, production, in, peru, declined, by, 22, some, refer, to, this, as, the, quinoa, bust, because, of, the, devastation, the, price, fall, caused, for, farmers, and, industry, rising, quinoa, prices, over, the, period, of, 2006, to, 2017, may, have, reduced, the, affordability, of, quinoa, to, traditional, consumers, 176, 77, however, a, 2016, study, using, peru, s, encuesta, nacional, de, hogares, found, that, rising, quinoa, prices, during, 2004, 2013, led, to, net, economic, benefits, for, producers, and, other, commentary, indicated, similar, conclusions, including, for, women, specifically, impacts, of, the, price, surge, on, quinoa, consumption, in, the, andes, mainly, affected, urban, poor, rather, than, farmers, themselves, and, these, impacts, were, reduced, when, the, price, fell, in, 2015, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, as, quinoa, producers, rise, above, subsistence, level, income, they, switch, their, own, consumption, to, western, processed, foods, which, are, often, less, healthy, than, a, traditional, quinoa, based, diet, whether, because, quinoa, is, held, to, be, worth, too, much, to, keep, for, oneself, and, one, s, family, or, because, processed, foods, have, higher, status, despite, their, poorer, nutritional, value, 176, 77, efforts, are, being, made, in, some, areas, to, distribute, quinoa, more, widely, and, ensure, that, farming, and, poorer, populations, have, access, to, it, and, have, an, understanding, of, its, nutritional, importance, including, use, in, free, school, breakfasts, and, government, provisions, distributed, to, pregnant, and, nursing, women, in, need, in, terms, of, wider, social, consequences, research, on, traditional, producers, in, bolivia, has, emphasised, a, complex, picture, the, degree, to, which, individual, producers, benefit, from, the, global, quinoa, boom, depends, on, its, mode, of, production, for, example, through, producer, associations, and, co, operatives, such, as, the, asociaci, n, nacional, de, productores, de, quinua, founded, in, the, 1970s, contracting, through, vertically, integrated, private, firms, or, wage, labor, state, regulation, and, enforcement, may, promote, a, shift, to, cash, cropping, among, some, farmers, and, a, shift, toward, subsistence, production, among, others, while, enabling, many, urban, refugees, to, return, to, working, the, land, outcomes, with, complex, and, varied, social, effects, the, growth, of, quinoa, consumption, outside, of, its, indigenous, region, has, raised, concerns, over, food, security, of, the, original, consumers, unsustainably, intensive, farming, of, the, crop, expansion, of, farming, into, otherwise, marginal, agricultural, lands, with, concurrent, loss, of, the, natural, environment, threatening, both, the, sustainability, of, producer, agriculture, and, the, biodiversity, of, quinoa, world, demand, for, quinoa, is, sometimes, presented, in, the, media, particularly, as, being, caused, by, rising, veganism, but, one, academic, has, commented, that, despite, the, drawbacks, of, quinoa, meat, production, in, most, cases, is, still, less, sustainable, than, quinoa, 177, the, united, nations, general, assembly, declared, 2013, as, the, international, year, of, quinoa, in, recognition, of, the, ancestral, practices, of, the, andean, people, who, have, preserved, it, as, a, food, for, present, and, future, generations, through, knowledge, and, practices, of, living, in, harmony, with, nature, the, objective, was, to, draw, the, world, s, attention, to, the, role, that, quinoa, could, play, in, providing, food, security, nutrition, and, poverty, eradication, in, support, of, achieving, millennium, development, goals, some, academic, commentary, emphasized, that, quinoa, production, could, have, ecological, and, social, drawbacks, in, its, native, regions, and, that, these, problems, needed, to, be, tackled, quinoa, is, used, in, the, jewish, community, as, a, substitute, for, the, leavened, grains, that, are, forbidden, during, the, passover, holiday, several, kosher, certification, organizations, refuse, to, certify, it, as, being, kosher, for, passover, citing, reasons, including, its, resemblance, to, prohibited, grains, or, fear, of, cross, contamination, of, the, product, from, nearby, fields, of, prohibited, grain, or, during, packaging, however, in, december, 2013, the, orthodox, union, the, world, s, largest, kosher, certification, agency, announced, it, would, begin, certifying, quinoa, as, kosher, for, passover, quinoa, is, an, allotetraploid, plant, containing, two, full, sets, of, chromosomes, from, two, different, species, which, hybridised, with, each, other, at, one, time, according, to, a, 1979, study, its, presumed, ancestor, is, either, chenopodium, berlandieri, from, north, america, or, the, andean, species, ch, hircinum, although, more, recent, studies, in, 2011, even, suggest, old, world, relatives, on, the, other, hand, morphological, features, relate, ch, quinoa, of, the, andes, and, ch, nuttalliae, of, mexico, some, studies, have, suggested, that, both, species, may, have, been, derived, from, the, same, wild, type, a, weedy, quinoa, ch, quinoa, var, melanospermum, is, known, from, south, america, but, no, equivalent, closely, related, to, ch, nutalliae, has, been, reported, from, mexico, so, far, studies, regarding, the, genetic, diversity, of, quinoa, suggest, that, it, may, have, passed, through, at, least, three, bottleneck, genetic, events, with, a, possible, fourth, expected, over, the, last, 5, 000, years, the, biogeography, of, ch, quinoa, has, changed, greatly, mainly, by, human, influence, convenience, and, preference, it, has, changed, not, only, in, the, area, of, distribution, but, also, in, regards, to, the, climate, this, plant, was, originally, adapted, to, in, contrast, to, the, climates, on, which, it, is, able, to, successfully, grow, in, now, in, a, process, started, by, a, number, of, pre, inca, south, american, indigenous, cultures, people, in, chile, have, been, adapting, quinoa, to, salinity, and, other, forms, of, stress, over, the, last, 3, 000, years, quinoa, is, also, cultivated, since, an, early, date, near, the, coast, of, northern, chile, where, it, was, grown, by, the, chinchorro, culture, ch, quinoa, was, brought, to, the, lowlands, of, south, central, chile, at, an, early, date, from, the, andean, highlands, varieties, in, the, lowlands, of, south, central, chile, derive, directly, from, ancestral, cultivars, which, then, evolved, in, parallel, to, those, of, the, highlands, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, introduction, of, ch, quinoa, occurred, before, highland, varieties, with, floury, perisperm, emerged, there, are, wide, discrepancies, in, the, suggested, dates, of, introduction, one, study, suggests, c, 1000, bc, as, the, introduction, date, while, another, suggests, 600, 1100, ad, in, colonial, times, the, plant, is, known, to, have, been, cultivated, as, far, south, as, chilo, archipelago, and, the, shores, of, nahuel, huapi, lake, the, cuisine, of, chilo, included, bread, made, of, quinoa, until, at, least, the, mid, 19th, century, in, chile, it, had, almost, disappeared, by, the, early, 1940s, as, of, 2015, the, crop, is, mostly, grown, in, three, areas, by, only, some, 300, smallholder, farmers, each, of, these, areas, is, different, indigenous, small, scale, growers, near, the, border, with, bolivia, who, grow, many, types, of, bolivian, forms, a, few, farmers, in, the, central, region, who, exclusively, grow, a, white, seeded, variety, and, generally, market, their, crops, through, a, well, known, cooperative, and, in, the, south, by, women, in, home, gardens, in, mapuche, reserves, when, amaranthaceae, became, abundant, in, lake, pacucha, peru, the, lake, was, fresh, and, the, lack, of, amaranthaceae, taxa, strongly, indicates, droughts, which, turned, the, lake, into, a, saltmarsh, based, on, the, pollen, associated, with, soil, manipulation, this, is, an, area, of, the, andes, where, domestication, of, c, quinoa, became, popular, although, it, was, not, the, only, one, it, was, domesticated, in, various, geographical, zones, with, this, morphological, adaptations, began, to, happen, until, having, five, ecotypes, today, quinoa, s, genetic, diversity, illustrates, that, it, was, and, is, a, vital, crop, andean, agronomists, and, nutrition, scientists, began, researching, quinoa, in, the, early, twentieth, century, and, it, became, the, subject, of, much, interest, among, researchers, involved, in, neglected, and, underutilized, crop, studies, in, the, 1970s, the, grain, however, has, received, much, less, attention, than, crops, like, maize, or, wheat, particularly, for, the, high, variety, of, chilean, landraces, in, addition, to, how, the, plant, has, adapted, to, different, latitudes, this, crop, is, now, potentially, cultivable, almost, anywhere, in, the, world
