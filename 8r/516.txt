the, european, seabass, dicentrarchus, labrax, also, known, as, the, branzino, european, bass, sea, bass, common, bass, white, bass, capemouth, white, salmon, sea, perch, white, mullet, sea, dace, or, loup, de, mer, is, a, primarily, ocean, going, fish, native, to, the, waters, off, europe, s, western, and, southern, and, africa, s, northern, coasts, though, it, can, also, be, found, in, shallow, coastal, waters, and, river, mouths, during, the, summer, months, and, late, autumn, it, is, one, of, only, six, species, in, its, family, moronidae, collectively, called, the, temperate, basses, it, is, fished, and, raised, commercially, and, is, considered, the, most, important, fish, currently, cultured, in, the, mediterranean, in, ireland, and, the, united, kingdom, the, popular, restaurant, fish, sold, and, consumed, as, sea, bass, is, exclusively, the, european, bass, in, north, america, it, is, widely, known, by, one, of, its, italian, names, branzino, european, seabass, is, a, slow, growing, species, that, takes, several, years, to, reach, adulthood, an, adult, european, seabass, usually, weighs, around, 2, 5, kg, 5, 5, lb, european, seabass, can, reach, measurements, of, up, to, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, in, length, and, 12, kg, 26, lb, in, weight, though, the, most, common, size, is, only, about, half, of, that, at, 0, 5, m, 1, ft, 8, in, individuals, are, silvery, grey, and, sometimes, a, dark, bluish, color, on, the, back, juveniles, form, schools, and, feed, on, invertebrates, while, adults, are, less, social, and, prefer, to, consume, other, fish, they, are, generally, found, in, the, littoral, zone, near, the, banks, of, rivers, lagoons, and, estuaries, during, the, summer, and, migrate, offshore, during, the, winter, european, sea, bass, feed, on, prawns, crabs, and, small, fish, though, it, is, a, sought, after, gamefish, it, is, listed, as, least, concern, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, because, it, is, widespread, and, there, are, no, known, major, threats, the, european, seabass, was, first, described, in, 1758, by, swedish, zoologist, carl, linnaeus, in, his, work, systema, naturae, he, named, it, perca, labrax, in, the, century, and, a, half, following, it, was, classified, under, a, variety, of, new, synonyms, with, dicentrarchus, labrax, winning, out, as, the, accepted, name, in, 1987, its, generic, name, dicentrarchus, derives, from, greek, from, the, presence, of, two, anal, spines, di, meaning, two, kentron, meaning, sting, and, archos, meaning, anus, the, european, bass, is, sold, under, dozens, of, common, names, in, various, languages, in, the, british, isles, it, is, known, as, the, european, bass, european, seabass, common, bass, capemouth, king, of, the, mullets, sea, bass, sea, dace, sea, perch, white, mullet, white, salmon, or, simply, bass, m, mississippiensis, m, chrysops, m, americana, m, saxatillis, d, punctatus, d, labrax, there, are, two, genetically, distinct, populations, of, wild, european, seabass, the, first, is, found, in, the, northeast, atlantic, ocean, and, the, second, is, in, the, western, mediterranean, sea, the, two, populations, are, separated, by, a, relatively, narrow, distance, in, a, region, known, as, the, almeria, oran, oceanographic, front, located, east, of, the, spanish, city, of, almer, a, the, exact, reason, for, this, separation, is, unknown, as, the, geographic, divide, should, not, account, for, the, lack, of, gene, flow, between, the, two, populations, the, larval, stage, of, the, european, seabass, can, last, up, to, 3, months, during, which, it, cannot, swim, well, and, even, a, small, amount, of, water, flow, should, transport, some, individuals, between, the, two, regions, in, addition, juveniles, can, survive, temperature, and, salinity, changes, and, adults, can, migrate, hundreds, of, miles, european, seabass, habitats, include, estuaries, lagoons, coastal, waters, and, rivers, it, is, found, in, a, large, part, of, the, eastern, atlantic, ocean, from, southern, norway, to, senegal, it, can, also, be, found, in, the, entire, mediterranean, sea, and, in, the, southern, black, sea, but, is, absent, from, the, baltic, sea, it, has, entered, the, red, sea, through, the, suez, canal, as, an, anti, lessepsian, migrant, it, is, a, seasonally, migratory, species, moving, further, winter, spawning, grounds, during, at, least, one, month, before, moving, towards, their, summer, feeding, areas, the, european, seabass, hunts, as, much, during, the, day, as, it, does, at, night, feeding, on, small, fish, both, pelagic, such, as, sardines, sprats, and, sand, smelts, and, demersal, such, as, sand, eels, polychaetes, cephalopods, such, as, squid, and, crustaceans, the, big, fish, weighing, more, than, 4, kg, 8, 8, lb, are, mostly, night, hunters, they, spawn, from, february, to, june, mostly, in, inshore, waters, as, fry, they, are, pelagic, but, as, they, develop, they, move, into, estuaries, where, they, stay, for, a, year, or, two, annual, catches, of, wild, european, seabass, are, relatively, modest, fluctuating, between, 8, 500, and, 11, 900, tonnes, from, 2000, to, 2009, most, reported, catches, originate, from, the, atlantic, ocean, with, france, typically, reporting, the, highest, catches, in, the, mediterranean, italy, used, to, report, the, largest, catches, but, has, been, surpassed, by, egypt, the, fish, has, come, under, increasing, pressure, from, commercial, fishing, and, became, the, focus, in, the, united, kingdom, of, a, conservation, effort, by, recreational, anglers, the, republic, of, ireland, has, strict, laws, regarding, bass, all, commercial, fishing, for, the, species, is, banned, and, several, restrictions, are, in, place, for, recreational, anglers, a, closed, season, from, may, 15, june, 15, inclusive, every, year, a, minimum, size, of, 400, mm, 16, in, and, a, bag, limit, of, two, fish, per, day, in, a, scientific, advisory, june, 2013, it, is, stressed, that, fishing, mortality, is, increasing, the, total, biomass, has, been, declining, since, 2005, total, biomass, assumed, as, the, best, stock, size, indicator, in, the, last, two, years, 2011, 2012, was, 32, lower, than, the, total, biomass, in, the, three, previous, years, 2008, 2010, european, seabass, was, one, of, europe, s, first, fish, to, be, farmed, commercially, historically, they, were, cultured, in, coastal, lagoons, and, tidal, reservoirs, before, mass, production, techniques, were, developed, in, the, late, 1960s, it, is, the, most, important, commercial, fish, widely, cultured, in, the, mediterranean, greece, turkey, italy, spain, croatia, and, egypt, are, the, most, important, farming, countries, annual, production, was, more, than, 120, 000, tonnes, in, 2010, the, biggest, producer, in, the, world, for, european, seabass, is, turkey
