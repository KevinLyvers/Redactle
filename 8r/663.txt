habia, chlorothraupis, piranga, cardinalis, caryothraustes, periporphyrus, pheucticus, granatellus, spiza, amaurospiza, cyanoloxia, cyanocompsa, passerina, cardinalidae, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, cardinal, grosbeaks, or, simply, the, cardinals, is, a, family, of, new, world, endemic, passerine, birds, that, consists, of, cardinals, grosbeaks, and, buntings, it, also, includes, several, other, genera, such, as, the, tanager, like, piranga, and, the, warbler, like, granatellus, membership, of, this, family, is, not, easily, defined, by, a, single, or, even, a, set, of, physical, characteristics, but, instead, by, molecular, work, among, songbirds, they, range, from, average, sized, to, relatively, large, and, have, stout, features, some, species, with, large, heavy, bills, members, of, this, group, are, beloved, for, their, brilliant, red, yellow, or, blue, plumages, seen, in, many, of, the, breeding, males, in, this, family, most, species, are, monogamous, breeders, that, nest, in, open, cup, nests, with, parents, taking, turns, incubating, the, nest, and, taking, care, of, their, young, most, are, arboreal, species, although, the, dickcissel, is, a, ground, dwelling, prairie, bird, in, terms, of, conservation, most, members, of, this, family, are, considered, least, concern, by, the, iucn, red, list, though, a, few, birds, such, as, the, carrizal, seedeater, are, considered, to, be, endangered, the, grosbeaks, seedeaters, and, cardinals, have, large, bills, while, granatellus, and, buntings, have, small, bills, the, cardinalid, tanagers, have, stout, near, pointed, bills, with, some, species, of, piranga, having, serrations, along, the, edge, of, their, upper, bills, this, bill, shape, is, not, always, an, indicator, of, relationships, as, the, various, species, of, blue, cardinalid, species, like, the, blue, grosbeak, and, cyanoloxia, grosbeaks, are, related, to, the, buntings, similarly, the, cardinalid, tanagers, are, closer, to, the, cardinals, and, masked, grosbeaks, see, more, in, the, systematics, section, the, head, is, medium, to, large, in, size, with, a, medium, neck, length, the, body, of, cardinalids, ranges, from, small, to, medium, with, lengths, of, 4, 5, to, 11, in, 11, to, 28, cm, legs, are, also, short, to, medium, in, length, the, wings, are, medium, and, pointed, cardinalids, have, nine, visible, primary, feathers, with, the, tenth, primary, feather, being, short, in, comparison, the, plumages, in, cardinalids, are, sexually, dichromatic, as, many, males, of, various, species, display, bright, reds, oranges, blues, or, blacks, in, most, temperate, species, males, will, undergo, molting, between, seasons, so, that, non, breeding, males, will, somewhat, resemble, the, females, of, their, species, these, species, such, as, the, indigo, bunting, will, exhibit, a, complex, molt, cycle, going, through, four, different, stages, of, plumage, coverage, within, their, first, year, of, life, from, spring, to, summer, birds, start, with, juvenile, plumage, to, supplemental, plumage, then, changing, to, a, first, basic, nonbreeding, plumage, from, fall, to, winter, and, finally, reaching, the, first, alternate, breeding, plumage, adults, will, typically, have, the, basic, two, molt, cycle, changing, to, basic, or, partial, in, the, late, summer, or, fall, and, then, back, to, alternate, again, in, the, spring, males, of, tropical, species, will, have, the, same, coloration, year, round, females, of, all, species, are, either, drabber, in, coloration, by, comparison, often, having, a, lighter, coloration, of, the, males, the, molting, pattern, in, most, cardinalids, exhibits, delayed, plumage, maturation, causing, the, first, year, male, birds, to, often, be, in, non, breeding, plumage, or, at, an, intermediate, stage, the, molting, pattern, in, cardinalids, is, divided, into, two, types, a, preformative, molt, is, a, partial, molt, where, only, the, body, feathers, get, replaced, but, not, the, wing, and, tail, feathers, which, is, seen, in, a, lot, of, temperate, and, neotropical, species, the, second, type, is, an, eccentric, preformative, molt, when, only, the, outer, primary, and, inner, secondaries, are, replaced, this, molt, is, seen, in, some, species, of, cyanoloxia, and, passerina, traditionally, members, of, this, group, were, classified, as, a, tribe, of, the, finch, family, fringillidae, cardinalini, characterized, by, heavy, conical, seed, crushing, bills, the, group, consisted, of, the, genera, pheucticus, parkerthraustes, saltator, spiza, cyanocompsa, cyanoloxia, porphyrospiza, passerina, caryothraustes, periporphyrus, and, cardinalis, the, issue, that, taxonomists, had, faced, was, that, there, were, no, unifying, morphological, traits, that, were, in, agreement, for, various, studies, in, 2007, a, mitochondrial, dna, study, by, klicka, burns, and, spellman, sampling, all, of, the, aforementioned, genera, and, 34, of, the, total, 42, species, found, that, the, genera, parkerthraustes, saltator, and, porphyrospiza, were, not, members, of, the, cardinal, lineage, but, instead, are, found, throughout, in, the, tanager, lineage, thraupidae, interestingly, enough, the, genera, classified, as, thraupids, at, the, time, piranga, habia, chlorothraupis, and, amaurospiza, are, found, to, be, part, of, cardinalid, radiation, in, addition, the, genus, granatellus, originally, classified, as, a, parulid, warbler, are, also, found, to, be, part, of, cardinalidae, the, study, found, that, with, this, new, relationship, cardinalidae, can, be, classified, into, five, subgroups, which, have, been, supported, by, subsequent, studies, the, five, subclades, consists, of, the, habia, lineage, habia, and, chlorothraupis, the, masked, lineage, piranga, caryothraustes, periporphyrus, rhodothraupis, and, cardinalis, the, granatellus, lineage, the, blue, lineage, cyanocompsa, amaurospiza, cyanoloxia, passerina, and, spiza, and, the, pheucticus, lineage, these, subclades, and, membership, of, these, genera, have, been, widely, supported, in, subsequent, studies, a, 2021, paper, by, guallar, et, al, based, on, the, preformative, molting, pattern, of, cardinalids, suggested, the, ancestor, of, this, group, was, a, forest, dwelling, bird, that, dispersed, into, open, habitats, on, numerous, occasions, the, cardinalids, are, part, of, a, larger, grouping, of, american, endemic, songbirds, emberizoidea, which, also, includes, the, aforementioned, thraupids, and, parulids, as, well, as, icterids, new, world, blackbirds, passerellids, new, world, sparrows, and, several, families, that, contain, one, or, a, couple, of, genera, several, studies, have, placed, cardinalids, as, either, the, sister, group, to, thraupidae, mitrospingidae, a, small, family, whose, genera, were, formerly, classified, as, thraupids, or, the, sister, to, a, clade, containing, thraupids, and, mitrospingids, at, least, one, study, suggested, that, cardinalids, could, treated, as, a, subfamily, of, thraupidae, phylogeny, of, the, cardinalid, genera, after, klicka, et, al, 2007,

the, cardinalids, can, be, found, from, canada, to, northern, argentina, and, uruguay, with, central, america, having, the, most, concentrated, amount, of, species, species, are, found, year, around, in, the, central, united, states, and, the, eastern, united, states, down, to, the, neotropics, cardinalids, found, in, the, west, indies, are, non, breeding, migrants, and, those, in, the, western, united, states, and, canada, are, breeding, migrants, the, western, tanager, is, the, northernmost, species, in, the, family, with, their, breeding, ranges, occurring, in, the, southern, portions, of, the, northwest, territories, the, northern, cardinal, has, been, introduced, in, hawaii, and, bermuda, they, occupy, a, variety, of, habitats, from, forests, to, grassland, and, arid, scrubland, most, north, american, cardinalid, species, migrate, south, for, the, winter, whether, further, south, in, the, continent, or, extending, into, the, neotropics, except, the, northern, cardinal, and, pyrrhuloxia, which, stay, year, round, the, neotropical, species, are, residential, year, round, in, their, range, cardinals, the, dickcissel, seedeaters, buntings, and, grosbeaks, have, the, thicker, seed, crushing, bills, that, enabled, them, to, feed, heavily, on, fruits, and, seeds, outside, of, the, breeding, season, especially, in, the, winter, for, northern, species, like, the, aforementioned, dickcissel, and, northern, cardinal, once, their, breeding, season, begins, members, of, this, group, will, supplement, themselves, with, invertebrate, prey, vital, when, raising, their, young, and, refueling, their, energetic, costs, of, reproduction, and, other, daily, activities, the, genera, chlorothraupis, habia, piranga, and, granatellus, have, slightly, longer, and, less, deep, bills, which, their, diet, mostly, consists, of, insects, fruit, nectar, and, sap, less, so, on, seeds, cardinalids, typically, forage, alone, low, level, or, on, the, ground, though, some, like, piranga, and, grosbeaks, will, forage, high, in, the, tree, canopy, many, will, come, to, birdfeeders, especially, during, the, winter, nearly, all, cardinalids, are, monogamous, breeders, and, are, highly, territorial, despite, being, monogamous, this, is, only, during, the, breeding, season, and, each, year, the, birds, might, partner, up, with, a, different, bird, the, only, exception, is, the, dickcissel, which, is, a, polygynous, species, which, nest, in, dense, grasses, and, sedges, other, non, monogamous, species, include, the, lazuli, and, painted, buntings, which, perform, extra, copulation, with, multiple, partners, the, family, is, known, for, their, intense, brilliant, songs, in, some, species, like, the, lazuli, bunting, and, indigo, bunting, the, bird, learn, singing, by, match, based, meaning, that, first, year, breeding, males, will, learn, by, copying, the, songs, of, nearby, males, as, opposed, of, learning, it, while, they, are, in, the, nest, even, more, unusual, is, the, females, of, a, few, species, such, as, the, scarlet, tanager, northern, cardinal, pyrrhuloxia, and, black, headed, grosbeak, which, sing, as, well, in, temperate, species, the, breeding, season, occurs, annually, while, in, tropical, species, it, is, year, around, the, breeding, seasons, is, in, sync, with, the, abundance, of, insects, most, species, build, open, cup, nests, made, of, grasses, and, twigs, depending, on, the, species, these, nests, would, be, in, the, trees, often, high, up, in, the, crown, the, nest, building, is, done, by, both, partners, or, by, the, female, alone, the, male, and, female, take, turns, incubating, the, nest, often, the, male, would, feed, the, female, in, a, clutch, on, average, there, are, 1, to, 6, six, eggs, with, tropical, species, laying, the, fewest, cardinalids, produce, one, to, three, broods, per, season, as, with, other, passerines, the, young, are, born, altricial, and, fledged, between, one, and, two, weeks, as, of, 2021, the, iucn, red, list, has, nearly, 82, percent, of, cardinalids, to, be, least, concern, however, there, are, a, handful, of, species, that, are, of, conservation, concern, the, rose, bellied, bunting, is, an, endemic, near, threatened, species, as, they, are, found, in, a, small, area, of, oaxaca, and, chiapas, mexico, the, black, cheeked, ant, tanager, is, another, endemic, species, found, in, osa, peninsula, in, costa, rica, and, the, carrizal, seedeater, a, critically, endangered, species, found, in, the, spiny, bamboo, thickets, in, the, understory, of, deciduous, forest, in, a, remote, southeastern, corner, of, venezuela, all, of, these, species, are, threatened, with, habitat, loss, and, the, confinement, within, their, much, smaller, range, the, iucn, has, not, yet, reevaluate, the, other, species, of, seedeaters, in, the, genus, amaurospiza, despite, the, vast, majority, of, species, being, classified, as, least, concern, there, has, been, a, growing, concern, in, how, the, ongoing, climate, crisis, will, affect, the, distribution, and, migration, of, many, species, across, the, globe, one, study, led, by, dr, brooke, l, bateman, published, in, july, 2020, focused, on, the, risk, north, american, birds, will, face, from, climate, change, and, the, measures, needed, to, protect, them, the, first, study, assessed, 604, species, from, the, united, states, found, that, if, the, planet, warmed, by, 3, 0, degrees, celsius, many, species, especially, arctic, birds, waterbirds, and, boreal, and, western, forest, birds, will, be, highly, vulnerable, to, climate, change, and, future, conservation, efforts, will, need, to, be, in, place, among, the, species, sampled, the, north, american, species, of, piranga, and, pheucticus, are, found, to, be, most, climate, vulnerable, of, the, cardinalids, these, species, will, either, lose, some, substantial, amount, of, their, range, or, they, will, migrate, up, north, to, escape, the, sudden, change, in, their, habitat, a, possible, extinct, species, is, the, controversial, townsend, s, bunting, a, supposed, enigmatic, species, related, to, the, dickcissel, the, townsend, s, bunting, is, only, known, from, a, single, type, specimen, collected, from, chester, county, pennsylvania, by, john, kirk, townsend, and, described, by, john, james, audubon, in, 1834, the, specimen, is, housed, in, the, national, museum, of, natural, history, genetic, work, has, not, been, done, on, this, bird, but, observation, of, the, plumage, has, been, done, the, controversy, stems, from, the, uncertainty, from, authors, whether, the, bird, is, an, extinct, species, a, rare, color, variant, of, the, dickcissel, or, a, hybrid, female, dickcissel, and, male, blue, grosbeak, if, the, bird, is, indeed, simply, a, dickcissel, it, lacks, any, of, the, known, field, characteristics, seen, in, the, species, in, all, life, stages, and, sexes
