morus, papasula, sula, enkurosulidae, kashin, 1977, pseudosulidae, harrison, 1975, the, bird, family, sulidae, comprises, the, gannets, and, boobies, collectively, called, sulids, they, are, medium, large, coastal, seabirds, that, plunge, dive, for, fish, and, similar, prey, the, 10, species, in, this, family, are, often, considered, congeneric, in, older, sources, placing, all, in, the, genus, sula, however, sula, true, boobies, and, morus, gannets, can, be, readily, distinguished, by, morphological, behavioral, and, dna, sequence, characters, abbott, s, booby, papasula, is, given, its, own, genus, as, it, stands, apart, from, both, in, these, respects, it, appears, to, be, a, distinct, and, ancient, lineage, maybe, closer, to, the, gannets, than, to, the, true, boobies, sulids, measure, about, 60, to, 85, cm, 24, to, 33, in, in, length, and, have, a, wingspan, around, 140, to, 175, cm, 4, 59, to, 5, 74, ft, they, have, long, narrow, and, pointed, wings, and, a, quite, long, graduated, and, rather, lozenge, shaped, tail, whose, outer, feathers, are, shorter, than, the, central, ones, their, flight, muscles, are, rather, small, to, allow, for, the, small, cross, section, required, for, plunge, diving, as, an, adaptive, trade, off, relative, to, some, sacrifice, in, flight, performance, consequently, they, are, very, streamlined, reducing, drag, so, their, bodies, are, torpedo, shaped, and, somewhat, flat, they, have, stout, legs, and, webbed, feet, with, the, web, connecting, all, four, toes, in, some, species, the, webs, are, brightly, colored, and, used, in, courtship, displays, the, bill, is, usually, conspicuously, colored, long, deep, at, the, base, and, pointed, with, saw, like, edges, the, upper, mandible, curves, down, slightly, at, the, tip, and, can, be, moved, upward, to, accept, large, prey, to, keep, water, out, during, plunges, the, nostrils, enter, into, the, bill, rather, than, opening, to, the, outside, directly, the, eyes, are, angled, forward, and, provide, a, wider, field, of, binocular, vision, than, in, most, other, birds, their, plumage, is, either, all, white, or, light, brownish, or, greyish, with, dark, wingtips, and, usually, tail, or, at, least, some, dark, brown, or, black, above, with, white, underparts, gannets, have, a, yellowish, hue, to, their, heads, the, face, usually, has, some, sort, of, black, markings, typically, on, the, lores, unlike, their, relatives, the, darters, and, cormorants, sulids, have, a, well, developed, preen, gland, whose, waxy, secretions, they, spread, on, their, feathers, for, waterproofing, and, pest, control, they, moult, their, tail, feathers, irregularly, and, the, flight, feathers, of, their, wings, in, stages, so, that, starting, at, the, first, moult, they, always, have, some, old, feathers, some, new, ones, and, some, partly, grown, ones, moult, as, a, response, to, periods, of, stress, has, been, recorded, the, sulids, are, distributed, mainly, in, tropical, and, subtropical, waters, but, they, particularly, gannets, are, found, in, temperate, regions, too, these, birds, are, not, truly, pelagic, seabirds, like, the, related, procellariiformes, and, usually, stay, rather, close, to, the, coasts, but, the, abundant, colonies, of, sulids, that, exist, on, many, pacific, islands, suggest, that, they, are, not, infrequently, blown, away, from, their, home, range, by, storms, and, can, wander, for, long, distances, in, search, of, a, safe, place, to, land, if, need, be, all, species, feed, entirely, at, sea, mostly, on, mid, sized, fish, and, similarly, sized, marine, invertebrates, e, g, cephalopods, many, species, feed, communally, and, some, species, follow, fishing, boats, to, scavenge, discarded, bycatch, and, chum, the, typical, hunting, behavior, is, a, dive, from, midair, taking, the, bird, a, 1, 2, m, under, water, if, prey, manages, to, escape, the, diving, birds, at, first, they, may, give, chase, using, their, legs, and, wings, for, underwater, swimming, as, noted, above, the, behavioral, traits, of, gannets, and, boobies, differ, considerably, but, the, sulidae, as, a, whole, are, characterized, by, several, behavioral, synapomorphies, before, taking, off, they, point, their, bills, upwards, gannets, or, forward, boobies, after, landing, again, they, point, downwards, with, their, bills, in, response, to, a, threat, they, do, not, attack, but, shake, their, heads, and, point, their, bills, towards, the, intruders, all, sulids, breed, in, colonies, males, examine, the, colony, area, in, flight, and, then, pick, a, nest, site, which, they, defend, by, fighting, and, territorial, displays, males, then, advertise, to, females, by, a, special, display, and, call, their, display, behavior, is, characteristic, though, not, as, diverse, as, the, numerous, variations, found, among, the, cormorants, it, typically, includes, the, male, shaking, his, head, females, search, the, colony, in, flight, and, on, foot, for, a, mate, once, they, select, males, pairs, maintain, their, bonds, by, preening, each, other, and, by, frequent, copulation, the, clutch, is, typically, two, eggs, the, eggs, are, unmarked, but, may, become, stained, by, debris, in, the, nest, whitish, pale, blue, green, or, pink, and, have, a, coating, that, resembles, lime, egg, weight, ranges, from, 3, 3, to, 8, 0, of, the, female, s, weight, incubation, lasts, 42, to, 55, days, depending, on, the, species, both, sexes, incubate, like, their, relatives, they, do, not, have, brood, patches, but, their, feet, become, vascularized, and, hot, and, the, birds, place, the, eggs, under, the, webs, eggs, lost, during, the, first, half, of, incubation, are, replaced, at, hatching, parents, move, the, eggs, and, then, the, hatchlings, to, the, tops, of, their, webs, the, young, hatch, naked, but, soon, develop, white, down, they, beg, by, touching, the, parent, s, bill, and, take, regurgitated, food, straight, from, its, gape, at, first, at, least, one, parent, is, always, in, attendance, of, the, altricial, young, after, two, weeks, both, parents, leave, the, nest, unguarded, at, times, while, they, go, fishing, the, times, for, the, chicks, to, fledge, and, become, independent, of, their, parents, depend, greatly, on, the, food, supply, rarely, does, more, than, one, chick, survive, to, maturity, except, in, the, peruvian, booby, sula, variegata, which, has, the, biggest, clutch, two, to, four, eggs, and, less, often, in, the, blue, footed, booby, s, nebouxii, siblicide, by, the, stronger, of, two, chicks, is, frequent, sulids, are, related, to, a, number, of, other, aquatic, birds, which, all, lack, external, nostrils, and, a, brood, patch, but, have, all, four, toes, webbed, and, a, gular, sac, the, closest, living, relatives, of, the, sulidae, are, the, phalacrocoracidae, cormorants, and, shags, and, the, anhingidae, darters, the, latter, are, somewhat, intermediate, between, sulids, and, cormorants, but, like, many, cormorants, they, are, freshwater, birds, in, a, clade, containing, otherwise, seabirds, and, also, symplesiomorphic, with, sulids, but, synapomorphic, with, cormorants, in, some, other, respects, thus, the, sulidae, seem, to, be, the, oldest, and, most, distinct, lineage, of, those, three, which, are, united, in, a, suborder, sulae, therein, the, sulidae, are, typically, placed, simply, as, a, family, sometimes, a, superfamily, suloidea, is, recognized, wherein, some, of, the, primitive, prehistoric, forms, e, g, empheresula, eostega, and, masillastega, are, placed, as, basal, lineages, distinct, from, the, living, sulidae, however, the, proposed, family, pseudosulidae, or, enkurosulidae, is, almost, certainly, invalid, abbott, s, booby, papasula, abbotti, northern, gannet, morus, bassanus, cape, gannet, morus, capensis, australasian, gannet, morus, serrator, red, footed, booby, sula, sula, brown, booby, sula, leucogaster, masked, booby, sula, dactylatra, nazca, booby, sula, granti, blue, footed, booby, sula, nebouxii, peruvian, booby, sula, variegata, the, sulae, were, traditionally, included, in, the, pelecaniformes, in, its, obsolete, paraphyletic, circumscription, but, pelicans, the, namesake, family, of, the, pelecaniformes, are, actually, more, closely, related, to, herons, ibises, and, spoonbills, the, hamerkop, and, the, shoebill, than, to, the, sulids, and, allies, in, recognition, of, this, the, sulae, have, been, proposed, for, separation, in, a, new, order, phalacrocoraciformes, which, also, includes, the, frigatebirds, fregatidae, as, well, as, one, or, more, prehistoric, lineages, that, are, entirely, extinct, today, the, ioc, world, bird, list, uses, suliformes, as, the, proposed, order, name, within, the, family, itself, three, living, genera, sula, boobies, six, species, papasula, abbott, s, booby, and, morus, gannets, three, species, are, recognized, a, 2011, study, of, multiple, genes, found, abbott, s, booby, to, be, basal, to, all, other, gannets, and, boobies, and, likely, to, have, diverged, from, them, around, 22, million, years, ago, and, the, ancestors, of, the, gannets, and, remaining, boobies, split, around, 17, million, years, ago, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, all, boobies, lived, in, the, late, miocene, around, 6, million, years, ago, after, which, time, the, boobies, steadily, diverged, the, gannets, split, more, recently, only, around, 2, 5, million, years, ago, the, fossil, record, of, sulids, is, quite, extensive, due, to, the, many, miocene, pliocene, forms, that, have, been, recovered, but, the, lineage, of, sulids, extends, back, to, the, eocene, and, all, things, such, as, the, early, eocene, frigatebird, limnofregata, considered, the, sulids, seem, to, have, diverged, from, the, lineage, leading, to, cormorants, and, darters, around, 50, million, years, ago, mya, perhaps, a, bit, earlier, the, initial, evolutionary, radiation, formed, a, number, of, genera, that, are, now, completely, extinct, such, as, the, freshwater, masillastega, which, as, noted, above, might, not, have, been, a, modern, type, sulid, or, the, bizarre, rhamphastosula, which, had, a, bill, shaped, like, an, aracari, s, the, modern, genera, evolved, like, many, other, living, genera, of, birds, around, the, oligocene, miocene, boundary, about, 23, mya, microsula, which, lived, during, that, time, seems, to, have, been, a, primitive, booby, that, still, had, many, symplesiomorphies, with, gannets, like, the, other, phalacrocoraciformes, the, sulids, originated, probably, in, the, general, region, of, the, atlantic, or, western, tethys, sea, probably, the, latter, rather, than, the, former, given, that, their, earliest, fossils, are, abundant, in, europe, but, absent, from, the, well, studied, contemporary, american, deposits, prehistoric, sulids, or, suloids, only, known, from, fossils, are, for, prehistoric, species, of, the, extant, genera, see, the, genus, articles, the, early, oligocene, prophalacrocorax, ronzoni, of, ronzon, france, was, variously, placed, in, the, seaduck, genus, mergus, in, sula, and, after, a, distinct, genus, was, established, for, it, in, the, phalacrocoracidae, while, it, is, quite, likely, to, belong, in, the, sulae, and, may, have, been, an, ancient, sulid, or, suloid, of, the, three, placements, explicitly, proposed, none, seems, to, be, correct
