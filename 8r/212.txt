muscle, contraction, is, the, activation, of, tension, generating, sites, within, muscle, cells, in, physiology, muscle, contraction, does, not, necessarily, mean, muscle, shortening, because, muscle, tension, can, be, produced, without, changes, in, muscle, length, such, as, when, holding, something, heavy, in, the, same, position, the, termination, of, muscle, contraction, is, followed, by, muscle, relaxation, which, is, a, return, of, the, muscle, fibers, to, their, low, tension, generating, state, for, the, contractions, to, happen, the, muscle, cells, must, rely, on, the, change, in, action, of, two, types, of, filaments, thin, and, thick, filaments, the, major, constituent, of, thin, filaments, is, a, chain, formed, by, helical, coiling, of, two, strands, of, actin, and, thick, filaments, dominantly, consist, of, chains, of, the, motor, protein, myosin, together, these, two, filaments, form, myofibrils, the, basic, functional, organelles, in, the, skeletal, muscle, system, in, vertebrates, skeletal, muscle, contractions, are, neurogenic, as, they, require, synaptic, input, from, motor, neurons, a, single, motor, neuron, is, able, to, innervate, multiple, muscle, fibers, thereby, causing, the, fibers, to, contract, at, the, same, time, once, innervated, the, protein, filaments, within, each, skeletal, muscle, fiber, slide, past, each, other, to, produce, a, contraction, which, is, explained, by, the, sliding, filament, theory, the, contraction, produced, can, be, described, as, a, twitch, summation, or, tetanus, depending, on, the, frequency, of, action, potentials, in, skeletal, muscles, muscle, tension, is, at, its, greatest, when, the, muscle, is, stretched, to, an, intermediate, length, as, described, by, the, length, tension, relationship, unlike, skeletal, muscle, the, contractions, of, smooth, and, cardiac, muscles, are, myogenic, meaning, that, they, are, initiated, by, the, smooth, or, heart, muscle, cells, themselves, instead, of, being, stimulated, by, an, outside, event, such, as, nerve, stimulation, although, they, can, be, modulated, by, stimuli, from, the, autonomic, nervous, system, the, mechanisms, of, contraction, in, these, muscle, tissues, are, similar, to, those, in, skeletal, muscle, tissues, muscle, contraction, can, also, be, described, in, terms, of, two, variables, length, and, tension, in, natural, movements, that, underlie, locomotor, activity, muscle, contractions, are, multifaceted, as, they, are, able, to, produce, changes, in, length, and, tension, in, a, time, varying, manner, therefore, neither, length, nor, tension, is, likely, to, remain, the, same, in, skeletal, muscles, that, contract, during, locomotion, contractions, can, be, described, as, isometric, if, the, muscle, tension, changes, but, the, muscle, length, remains, the, same, in, contrast, a, muscle, contraction, is, described, as, isotonic, if, muscle, tension, remains, the, same, throughout, the, contraction, if, the, muscle, length, shortens, the, contraction, is, concentric, if, the, muscle, length, lengthens, the, contraction, is, eccentric, muscle, contractions, can, be, described, based, on, two, variables, force, and, length, force, itself, can, be, differentiated, as, either, tension, or, load, muscle, tension, is, the, force, exerted, by, the, muscle, on, an, object, whereas, a, load, is, the, force, exerted, by, an, object, on, the, muscle, when, muscle, tension, changes, without, any, corresponding, changes, in, muscle, length, the, muscle, contraction, is, described, as, isometric, if, the, muscle, length, changes, while, muscle, tension, remains, the, same, then, the, muscle, contraction, is, isotonic, in, an, isotonic, contraction, the, muscle, length, can, either, shorten, to, produce, a, concentric, contraction, or, lengthen, to, produce, an, eccentric, contraction, in, natural, movements, that, underlie, locomotor, activity, muscle, contractions, are, multifaceted, as, they, are, able, to, produce, changes, in, length, and, tension, in, a, time, varying, manner, therefore, neither, length, nor, tension, is, likely, to, remain, constant, when, the, muscle, is, active, during, locomotor, activity, an, isometric, contraction, of, a, muscle, generates, tension, without, changing, length, an, example, can, be, found, when, the, muscles, of, the, hand, and, forearm, grip, an, object, the, joints, of, the, hand, do, not, move, but, muscles, generate, sufficient, force, to, prevent, the, object, from, being, dropped, in, isotonic, contraction, the, tension, in, the, muscle, remains, constant, despite, a, change, in, muscle, length, this, occurs, when, a, muscle, s, force, of, contraction, matches, the, total, load, on, the, muscle, in, concentric, contraction, muscle, tension, is, sufficient, to, overcome, the, load, and, the, muscle, shortens, as, it, contracts, this, occurs, when, the, force, generated, by, the, muscle, exceeds, the, load, opposing, its, contraction, during, a, concentric, contraction, a, muscle, is, stimulated, to, contract, according, to, the, sliding, filament, theory, this, occurs, throughout, the, length, of, the, muscle, generating, a, force, at, the, origin, and, insertion, causing, the, muscle, to, shorten, and, changing, the, angle, of, the, joint, in, relation, to, the, elbow, a, concentric, contraction, of, the, biceps, would, cause, the, arm, to, bend, at, the, elbow, as, the, hand, moved, from, the, leg, to, the, shoulder, a, biceps, curl, a, concentric, contraction, of, the, triceps, would, change, the, angle, of, the, joint, in, the, opposite, direction, straightening, the, arm, and, moving, the, hand, towards, the, leg, in, eccentric, contraction, the, tension, generated, while, isometric, is, insufficient, to, overcome, the, external, load, on, the, muscle, and, the, muscle, fibers, lengthen, as, they, contract, rather, than, working, to, pull, a, joint, in, the, direction, of, the, muscle, contraction, the, muscle, acts, to, decelerate, the, joint, at, the, end, of, a, movement, or, otherwise, control, the, repositioning, of, a, load, this, can, occur, involuntarily, e, g, when, attempting, to, move, a, weight, too, heavy, for, the, muscle, to, lift, or, voluntarily, e, g, when, the, muscle, is, smoothing, out, a, movement, or, resisting, gravity, such, as, during, downhill, walking, over, the, short, term, strength, training, involving, both, eccentric, and, concentric, contractions, appear, to, increase, muscular, strength, more, than, training, with, concentric, contractions, alone, however, exercise, induced, muscle, damage, is, also, greater, during, lengthening, contractions, during, an, eccentric, contraction, of, the, biceps, muscle, the, elbow, starts, the, movement, while, bent, and, then, straightens, as, the, hand, moves, away, from, the, shoulder, during, an, eccentric, contraction, of, the, triceps, muscle, the, elbow, starts, the, movement, straight, and, then, bends, as, the, hand, moves, towards, the, shoulder, desmin, titin, and, other, z, line, proteins, are, involved, in, eccentric, contractions, but, their, mechanism, is, poorly, understood, in, comparison, to, cross, bridge, cycling, in, concentric, contractions, though, the, muscle, is, doing, a, negative, amount, of, mechanical, work, work, is, being, done, on, the, muscle, chemical, energy, of, fat, or, glucose, or, temporarily, stored, in, atp, is, nevertheless, consumed, although, less, than, would, be, consumed, during, a, concentric, contraction, of, the, same, force, for, example, one, expends, more, energy, going, up, a, flight, of, stairs, than, going, down, the, same, flight, muscles, undergoing, heavy, eccentric, loading, suffer, greater, damage, when, overloaded, such, as, during, muscle, building, or, strength, training, exercise, as, compared, to, concentric, loading, when, eccentric, contractions, are, used, in, weight, training, they, are, normally, called, negatives, during, a, concentric, contraction, contractile, muscle, myofilaments, of, myosin, and, actin, slide, past, each, other, pulling, the, z, lines, together, during, an, eccentric, contraction, the, myofilaments, slide, past, each, other, the, opposite, way, though, the, actual, movement, of, the, myosin, heads, during, an, eccentric, contraction, is, not, known, exercise, featuring, a, heavy, eccentric, load, can, actually, support, a, greater, weight, muscles, are, approximately, 40, stronger, during, eccentric, contractions, than, during, concentric, contractions, and, also, results, in, greater, muscular, damage, and, delayed, onset, muscle, soreness, one, to, two, days, after, training, exercise, that, incorporates, both, eccentric, and, concentric, muscular, contractions, i, e, involving, a, strong, contraction, and, a, controlled, lowering, of, the, weight, can, produce, greater, gains, in, strength, than, concentric, contractions, alone, while, unaccustomed, heavy, eccentric, contractions, can, easily, lead, to, overtraining, moderate, training, may, confer, protection, against, injury, eccentric, contractions, normally, occur, as, a, braking, force, in, opposition, to, a, concentric, contraction, to, protect, joints, from, damage, during, virtually, any, routine, movement, eccentric, contractions, assist, in, keeping, motions, smooth, but, can, also, slow, rapid, movements, such, as, a, punch, or, throw, part, of, training, for, rapid, movements, such, as, pitching, during, baseball, involves, reducing, eccentric, braking, allowing, a, greater, power, to, be, developed, throughout, the, movement, eccentric, contractions, are, being, researched, for, their, ability, to, speed, rehabilitation, of, weak, or, injured, tendons, achilles, tendinitis, and, patellar, tendonitis, also, known, as, jumper, s, knee, or, patellar, tendonosis, have, been, shown, to, benefit, from, high, load, eccentric, contractions, in, vertebrate, animals, there, are, three, types, of, muscle, tissues, skeletal, smooth, and, cardiac, skeletal, muscle, constitutes, the, majority, of, muscle, mass, in, the, body, and, is, responsible, for, locomotor, activity, smooth, muscle, forms, blood, vessels, the, gastrointestinal, tract, and, other, areas, in, the, body, that, produce, sustained, contractions, cardiac, muscle, makes, up, the, heart, which, pumps, blood, skeletal, and, cardiac, muscles, are, called, striated, muscle, because, of, their, striped, appearance, under, a, microscope, which, is, due, to, the, highly, organized, alternating, pattern, of, a, bands, and, i, bands, excluding, reflexes, all, skeletal, muscle, contractions, occur, as, a, result, of, signals, originating, in, the, brain, the, brain, sends, electrochemical, signals, through, the, nervous, system, to, the, motor, neuron, that, innervates, several, muscle, fibers, in, the, case, of, some, reflexes, the, signal, to, contract, can, originate, in, the, spinal, cord, through, a, feedback, loop, with, the, grey, matter, other, actions, such, as, locomotion, breathing, and, chewing, have, a, reflex, aspect, to, them, the, contractions, can, be, initiated, either, consciously, or, unconsciously, a, neuromuscular, junction, is, a, chemical, synapse, formed, by, the, contact, between, a, motor, neuron, and, a, muscle, fiber, it, is, the, site, in, which, a, motor, neuron, transmits, a, signal, to, a, muscle, fiber, to, initiate, muscle, contraction, the, sequence, of, events, that, results, in, the, depolarization, of, the, muscle, fiber, at, the, neuromuscular, junction, begins, when, an, action, potential, is, initiated, in, the, cell, body, of, a, motor, neuron, which, is, then, propagated, by, saltatory, conduction, along, its, axon, toward, the, neuromuscular, junction, once, it, reaches, the, terminal, bouton, the, action, potential, causes, a, ca, 2, ion, influx, into, the, terminal, by, way, of, the, voltage, gated, calcium, channels, the, ca, 2, influx, causes, synaptic, vesicles, containing, the, neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, to, fuse, with, the, plasma, membrane, releasing, acetylcholine, into, the, synaptic, cleft, between, the, motor, neuron, terminal, and, the, neuromuscular, junction, of, the, skeletal, muscle, fiber, acetylcholine, diffuses, across, the, synapse, and, binds, to, and, activates, nicotinic, acetylcholine, receptors, on, the, neuromuscular, junction, activation, of, the, nicotinic, receptor, opens, its, intrinsic, sodium, potassium, channel, causing, sodium, to, rush, in, and, potassium, to, trickle, out, as, a, result, the, sarcolemma, reverses, polarity, and, its, voltage, quickly, jumps, from, the, resting, membrane, potential, of, 90mv, to, as, high, as, 75mv, as, sodium, enters, the, membrane, potential, then, becomes, hyperpolarized, when, potassium, exits, and, is, then, adjusted, back, to, the, resting, membrane, potential, this, rapid, fluctuation, is, called, the, end, plate, potential, the, voltage, gated, ion, channels, of, the, sarcolemma, next, to, the, end, plate, open, in, response, to, the, end, plate, potential, they, are, sodium, and, potassium, specific, and, only, allow, one, through, this, wave, of, ion, movements, creates, the, action, potential, that, spreads, from, the, motor, end, plate, in, all, directions, if, action, potentials, stop, arriving, then, acetylcholine, ceases, to, be, released, from, the, terminal, bouton, the, remaining, acetylcholine, in, the, synaptic, cleft, is, either, degraded, by, active, acetylcholine, esterase, or, reabsorbed, by, the, synaptic, knob, and, none, is, left, to, replace, the, degraded, acetylcholine, excitation, contraction, coupling, ecc, is, the, process, by, which, a, muscular, action, potential, in, the, muscle, fiber, causes, myofibrils, to, contract, in, skeletal, muscles, excitation, contraction, coupling, relies, on, a, direct, coupling, between, two, key, proteins, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, sr, calcium, release, channel, identified, as, the, ryanodine, receptor, 1, ryr1, and, the, voltage, gated, l, type, calcium, channel, identified, as, dihydropyridine, receptors, dhprs, dhprs, are, located, on, the, sarcolemma, which, includes, the, surface, sarcolemma, and, the, transverse, tubules, while, the, ryrs, reside, across, the, sr, membrane, the, close, apposition, of, a, transverse, tubule, and, two, sr, regions, containing, ryrs, is, described, as, a, triad, and, is, predominantly, where, excitation, contraction, coupling, takes, place, excitation, contraction, coupling, ecc, occurs, when, depolarization, of, skeletal, muscles, usually, through, neural, innervation, results, in, a, muscle, action, potential, this, action, potential, spreads, across, the, muscle, s, surface, and, into, the, muscle, fiber, s, network, of, t, tubules, depolarizing, the, inner, portion, of, the, muscle, fiber, this, activates, dihydropyridine, receptors, in, the, terminal, cisternae, which, are, in, close, proximity, to, ryanodine, receptors, in, the, adjacent, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, the, activated, dihydropyridine, receptors, physically, interact, with, ryanodine, receptors, to, activate, them, via, foot, processes, involving, conformational, changes, that, allosterically, activates, the, ryanodine, receptors, as, ryanodine, receptors, open, ca, 2, is, released, from, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, into, the, local, junctional, space, and, diffuses, into, the, bulk, cytoplasm, to, cause, a, calcium, spark, the, action, potential, creates, a, near, synchronous, activation, of, thousands, of, calcium, sparks, and, causes, a, cell, wide, increase, in, calcium, giving, rise, to, the, upstroke, of, the, calcium, transient, the, ca, 2, released, into, the, cytosol, binds, to, troponin, c, by, the, actin, filaments, this, bond, allows, the, actin, filaments, to, perform, cross, bridge, cycling, producing, force, and, in, some, situations, motion, when, the, desired, motion, is, accomplished, relaxation, can, be, achieved, quickly, through, numerous, pathways, relaxation, is, quickly, achieved, through, a, ca, 2, buffer, with, various, cytoplasmic, proteins, binding, to, ca, 2, with, very, high, affinity, these, cytoplasmic, proteins, allow, for, quick, relaxation, in, fast, twitch, muscles, although, slower, the, sarco, endoplasmic, reticulum, calcium, atpase, serca, actively, pumps, ca, 2, back, into, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, resulting, in, a, permanent, relaxation, until, the, next, action, potential, arrives, mitochondria, also, participate, in, ca, 2, reuptake, ultimately, delivering, their, gathered, ca, 2, to, serca, for, storage, in, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, a, few, of, the, relaxation, mechanisms, ncx, ca2, pumps, and, ca2, leak, channels, move, ca2, completely, out, of, the, cells, as, well, as, ca, 2, concentration, declines, to, resting, levels, ca2, releases, from, troponin, c, disallowing, cross, bridge, cycling, causing, the, force, to, decline, and, relaxation, to, occur, once, relaxation, has, fully, occurred, the, muscle, is, able, to, contract, again, thus, fully, resetting, the, cycle, the, sliding, filament, theory, describes, a, process, used, by, muscles, to, contract, it, is, a, cycle, of, repetitive, events, that, cause, a, thin, filament, to, slide, over, a, thick, filament, and, generate, tension, in, the, muscle, it, was, independently, developed, by, andrew, huxley, and, rolf, niedergerke, and, by, hugh, huxley, and, jean, hanson, in, 1954, physiologically, this, contraction, is, not, uniform, across, the, sarcomere, the, central, position, of, the, thick, filaments, becomes, unstable, and, can, shift, during, contraction, but, this, is, countered, by, the, actions, of, the, elastic, myofilament, of, titin, this, fine, myofilament, maintains, uniform, tension, across, the, sarcomere, by, pulling, the, thick, filament, into, a, central, position, cross, bridge, cycling, is, a, sequence, of, molecular, events, that, underlies, the, sliding, filament, theory, a, cross, bridge, is, a, myosin, projection, consisting, of, two, myosin, heads, that, extends, from, the, thick, filaments, each, myosin, head, has, two, binding, sites, one, for, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, and, another, for, actin, the, binding, of, atp, to, a, myosin, head, detaches, myosin, from, actin, thereby, allowing, myosin, to, bind, to, another, actin, molecule, once, attached, the, atp, is, hydrolyzed, by, myosin, which, uses, the, released, energy, to, move, into, the, cocked, position, whereby, it, binds, weakly, to, a, part, of, the, actin, binding, site, the, remainder, of, the, actin, binding, site, is, blocked, by, tropomyosin, with, the, atp, hydrolyzed, the, cocked, myosin, head, now, contains, adenosine, diphosphate, adp, p, i, two, ca, 2, ions, bind, to, troponin, c, on, the, actin, filaments, the, troponin, ca, 2, complex, causes, tropomyosin, to, slide, over, and, unblock, the, remainder, of, the, actin, binding, site, unblocking, the, rest, of, the, actin, binding, sites, allows, the, two, myosin, heads, to, close, and, myosin, to, bind, strongly, to, actin, the, myosin, head, then, releases, the, inorganic, phosphate, and, initiates, a, power, stroke, which, generates, a, force, of, 2, pn, the, power, stroke, moves, the, actin, filament, inwards, thereby, shortening, the, sarcomere, myosin, then, releases, adp, but, still, remains, tightly, bound, to, actin, at, the, end, of, the, power, stroke, adp, is, released, from, the, myosin, head, leaving, myosin, attached, to, actin, in, a, rigor, state, until, another, atp, binds, to, myosin, a, lack, of, atp, would, result, in, the, rigor, state, characteristic, of, rigor, mortis, once, another, atp, binds, to, myosin, the, myosin, head, will, again, detach, from, actin, and, another, cross, bridge, cycle, occurs, cross, bridge, cycling, is, able, to, continue, as, long, as, there, are, sufficient, amounts, of, atp, and, ca, 2, in, the, cytoplasm, termination, of, cross, bridge, cycling, can, occur, when, ca, 2, is, actively, pumped, back, into, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, when, ca, 2, is, no, longer, present, on, the, thin, filament, the, tropomyosin, changes, conformation, back, to, its, previous, state, so, as, to, block, the, binding, sites, again, the, myosin, ceases, binding, to, the, thin, filament, and, the, muscle, relaxes, the, ca, 2, ions, leave, the, troponin, molecule, to, maintain, the, ca, 2, ion, concentration, in, the, sarcoplasm, the, active, pumping, of, ca, 2, ions, into, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, creates, a, deficiency, in, the, fluid, around, the, myofibrils, this, causes, the, removal, of, ca, 2, ions, from, the, troponin, thus, the, tropomyosin, troponin, complex, again, covers, the, binding, sites, on, the, actin, filaments, and, contraction, ceases, the, strength, of, skeletal, muscle, contractions, can, be, broadly, separated, into, twitch, summation, and, tetanus, a, twitch, is, a, single, contraction, and, relaxation, cycle, produced, by, an, action, potential, within, the, muscle, fiber, itself, the, time, between, a, stimulus, to, the, motor, nerve, and, the, subsequent, contraction, of, the, innervated, muscle, is, called, the, latent, period, which, usually, takes, about, 10, ms, and, is, caused, by, the, time, taken, for, nerve, action, potential, to, propagate, the, time, for, chemical, transmission, at, the, neuromuscular, junction, then, the, subsequent, steps, in, excitation, contraction, coupling, if, another, muscle, action, potential, were, to, be, produced, before, the, complete, relaxation, of, a, muscle, twitch, then, the, next, twitch, will, simply, sum, onto, the, previous, twitch, thereby, producing, a, summation, summation, can, be, achieved, in, two, ways, frequency, summation, and, multiple, fiber, summation, in, frequency, summation, the, force, exerted, by, the, skeletal, muscle, is, controlled, by, varying, the, frequency, at, which, action, potentials, are, sent, to, muscle, fibers, action, potentials, do, not, arrive, at, muscles, synchronously, and, during, a, contraction, some, fraction, of, the, fibers, in, the, muscle, will, be, firing, at, any, given, time, in, a, typical, circumstance, when, humans, are, exerting, their, muscles, as, hard, as, they, are, consciously, able, roughly, one, third, of, the, fibers, in, each, of, those, muscles, will, fire, at, once, though, this, ratio, can, be, affected, by, various, physiological, and, psychological, factors, including, golgi, tendon, organs, and, renshaw, cells, this, low, level, of, contraction, is, a, protective, mechanism, to, prevent, avulsion, of, the, tendon, the, force, generated, by, a, 95, contraction, of, all, fibers, is, sufficient, to, damage, the, body, in, multiple, fiber, summation, if, the, central, nervous, system, sends, a, weak, signal, to, contract, a, muscle, the, smaller, motor, units, being, more, excitable, than, the, larger, ones, are, stimulated, first, as, the, strength, of, the, signal, increases, more, motor, units, are, excited, in, addition, to, larger, ones, with, the, largest, motor, units, having, as, much, as, 50, times, the, contractile, strength, as, the, smaller, ones, as, more, and, larger, motor, units, are, activated, the, force, of, muscle, contraction, becomes, progressively, stronger, a, concept, known, as, the, size, principle, allows, for, a, gradation, of, muscle, force, during, weak, contraction, to, occur, in, small, steps, which, then, become, progressively, larger, when, greater, amounts, of, force, are, required, finally, if, the, frequency, of, muscle, action, potentials, increases, such, that, the, muscle, contraction, reaches, its, peak, force, and, plateaus, at, this, level, then, the, contraction, is, a, tetanus, length, tension, relationship, relates, the, strength, of, an, isometric, contraction, to, the, length, of, the, muscle, at, which, the, contraction, occurs, muscles, operate, with, greatest, active, tension, when, close, to, an, ideal, length, often, their, resting, length, when, stretched, or, shortened, beyond, this, whether, due, to, the, action, of, the, muscle, itself, or, by, an, outside, force, the, maximum, active, tension, generated, decreases, this, decrease, is, minimal, for, small, deviations, but, the, tension, drops, off, rapidly, as, the, length, deviates, further, from, the, ideal, due, to, the, presence, of, elastic, proteins, within, a, muscle, cell, such, as, titin, and, extracellular, matrix, as, the, muscle, is, stretched, beyond, a, given, length, there, is, an, entirely, passive, tension, which, opposes, lengthening, combined, there, is, a, strong, resistance, to, lengthening, an, active, muscle, far, beyond, the, peak, of, active, tension, force, velocity, relationship, relates, the, speed, at, which, a, muscle, changes, its, length, usually, regulated, by, external, forces, such, as, load, or, other, muscles, to, the, amount, of, force, that, it, generates, force, declines, in, a, hyperbolic, fashion, relative, to, the, isometric, force, as, the, shortening, velocity, increases, eventually, reaching, zero, at, some, maximum, velocity, the, reverse, holds, true, for, when, the, muscle, is, stretched, force, increases, above, isometric, maximum, until, finally, reaching, an, absolute, maximum, this, intrinsic, property, of, active, muscle, tissue, plays, a, role, in, the, active, damping, of, joints, that, are, actuated, by, simultaneously, active, opposing, muscles, in, such, cases, the, force, velocity, profile, enhances, the, force, produced, by, the, lengthening, muscle, at, the, expense, of, the, shortening, muscle, this, favoring, of, whichever, muscle, returns, the, joint, to, equilibrium, effectively, increases, the, damping, of, the, joint, moreover, the, strength, of, the, damping, increases, with, muscle, force, the, motor, system, can, thus, actively, control, joint, damping, via, the, simultaneous, contraction, co, contraction, of, opposing, muscle, groups, smooth, muscles, can, be, divided, into, two, subgroups, single, unit, and, multiunit, single, unit, smooth, muscle, cells, can, be, found, in, the, gut, and, blood, vessels, because, these, cells, are, linked, together, by, gap, junctions, they, are, able, to, contract, as, a, functional, syncytium, single, unit, smooth, muscle, cells, contract, myogenically, which, can, be, modulated, by, the, autonomic, nervous, system, unlike, single, unit, smooth, muscle, cells, multiunit, smooth, muscle, cells, are, found, in, the, muscle, of, the, eye, and, in, the, base, of, hair, follicles, multiunit, smooth, muscle, cells, contract, by, being, separately, stimulated, by, nerves, of, the, autonomic, nervous, system, as, such, they, allow, for, fine, control, and, gradual, responses, much, like, motor, unit, recruitment, in, skeletal, muscle, the, contractile, activity, of, smooth, muscle, cells, can, be, tonic, sustained, or, phasic, transient, and, is, influenced, by, multiple, inputs, such, as, spontaneous, electrical, activity, neural, and, hormonal, inputs, local, changes, in, chemical, composition, and, stretch, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, contractile, activity, of, skeletal, muscle, cells, which, relies, on, a, single, neural, input, some, types, of, smooth, muscle, cells, are, able, to, generate, their, own, action, potentials, spontaneously, which, usually, occur, following, a, pacemaker, potential, or, a, slow, wave, potential, these, action, potentials, are, generated, by, the, influx, of, extracellular, ca, 2, and, not, na, like, skeletal, muscles, cytosolic, ca, 2, ions, are, also, required, for, crossbridge, cycling, in, smooth, muscle, cells, the, two, sources, for, cytosolic, ca, 2, in, smooth, muscle, cells, are, the, extracellular, ca, 2, entering, through, calcium, channels, and, the, ca, 2, ions, that, are, released, from, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, the, elevation, of, cytosolic, ca, 2, results, in, more, ca, 2, binding, to, calmodulin, which, then, binds, and, activates, myosin, light, chain, kinase, the, calcium, calmodulin, myosin, light, chain, kinase, complex, phosphorylates, myosin, on, the, 20, kilodalton, kda, myosin, light, chains, on, amino, acid, residue, serine, 19, enabling, the, molecular, interaction, of, myosin, and, actin, and, initiating, contraction, and, activating, the, myosin, atpase, unlike, skeletal, muscle, cells, smooth, muscle, cells, lack, troponin, even, though, they, contain, the, thin, filament, protein, tropomyosin, and, other, notable, proteins, caldesmon, and, calponin, thus, smooth, muscle, contractions, are, initiated, by, the, ca, 2, activated, phosphorylation, of, myosin, rather, than, ca, 2, binding, to, the, troponin, complex, that, regulates, myosin, binding, sites, on, actin, like, in, skeletal, and, cardiac, muscles, termination, of, crossbridge, cycling, and, leaving, the, muscle, in, latch, state, occurs, when, myosin, light, chain, phosphatase, removes, the, phosphate, groups, from, the, myosin, heads, phosphorylation, of, the, 20, kda, myosin, light, chains, correlates, well, with, the, shortening, velocity, of, smooth, muscle, during, this, period, there, is, a, rapid, burst, of, energy, use, as, measured, by, oxygen, consumption, within, a, few, minutes, of, initiation, the, calcium, level, markedly, decreases, the, 20, kda, myosin, light, chains, phosphorylation, decreases, and, energy, use, decreases, however, force, in, tonic, smooth, muscle, is, maintained, during, contraction, of, muscle, rapidly, cycling, crossbridges, form, between, activated, actin, and, phosphorylated, myosin, generating, force, it, is, hypothesized, that, the, maintenance, of, force, results, from, dephosphorylated, latch, bridges, that, slowly, cycle, and, maintain, force, a, number, of, kinases, such, as, rho, kinase, dapk3, and, protein, kinase, c, are, believed, to, participate, in, the, sustained, phase, of, contraction, and, ca, 2, flux, may, be, significant, although, smooth, muscle, contractions, are, myogenic, the, rate, and, strength, of, their, contractions, can, be, modulated, by, the, autonomic, nervous, system, postganglionic, nerve, fibers, of, parasympathetic, nervous, system, release, the, neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which, binds, to, muscarinic, acetylcholine, receptors, machrs, on, smooth, muscle, cells, these, receptors, are, metabotropic, or, g, protein, coupled, receptors, that, initiate, a, second, messenger, cascade, conversely, postganglionic, nerve, fibers, of, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, release, the, neurotransmitters, epinephrine, and, norepinephrine, which, bind, to, adrenergic, receptors, that, are, also, metabotropic, the, exact, effects, on, the, smooth, muscle, depend, on, the, specific, characteristics, of, the, receptor, activated, both, parasympathetic, input, and, sympathetic, input, can, be, either, excitatory, contractile, or, inhibitory, relaxing, there, are, two, types, of, cardiac, muscle, cells, autorhythmic, and, contractile, autorhythmic, cells, do, not, contract, but, instead, set, the, pace, of, contraction, for, other, cardiac, muscle, cells, which, can, be, modulated, by, the, autonomic, nervous, system, in, contrast, contractile, muscle, cells, cardiomyocytes, constitute, the, majority, of, the, heart, muscle, and, are, able, to, contract, in, both, skeletal, and, cardiac, muscle, excitation, contraction, e, c, coupling, depolarization, conduction, and, ca, 2, release, processes, occur, however, though, the, proteins, involved, are, similar, they, are, distinct, in, structure, and, regulation, the, dihydropyridine, receptors, dhprs, are, encoded, by, different, genes, and, the, ryanodine, receptors, ryrs, are, distinct, isoforms, besides, dhpr, contacts, with, ryr1, main, ryr, isoform, in, skeletal, muscle, to, regulate, ca, 2, release, in, skeletal, muscle, while, the, l, type, calcium, channel, dhpr, on, cardiac, myocytes, and, ryr2, main, ryr, isoform, in, cardiac, muscle, are, not, physically, coupled, in, cardiac, muscle, but, face, with, each, other, by, a, junctional, coupling, unlike, skeletal, muscle, e, c, coupling, in, cardiac, muscle, is, thought, to, depend, primarily, on, a, mechanism, called, calcium, induced, calcium, release, which, is, based, on, the, junctional, structure, between, t, tubule, and, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, junctophilin, 2, jph2, is, essential, to, maintain, this, structure, as, well, as, the, integrity, of, t, tubule, another, protein, receptor, accessory, protein, 5, reep5, functions, to, keep, the, normal, morphology, of, junctional, sr, defects, of, junctional, coupling, can, result, from, deficiencies, of, either, of, the, two, proteins, during, the, process, of, calcium, induced, calcium, release, ryr2s, are, activated, by, a, calcium, trigger, which, is, brought, about, by, the, flow, of, ca, 2, through, the, l, type, calcium, channels, after, this, cardiac, muscle, tends, to, exhibit, diad, structures, rather, than, triads, excitation, contraction, coupling, in, cardiac, muscle, cells, occurs, when, an, action, potential, is, initiated, by, pacemaker, cells, in, the, sinoatrial, node, or, atrioventricular, node, and, conducted, to, all, cells, in, the, heart, via, gap, junctions, the, action, potential, travels, along, the, surface, membrane, into, t, tubules, the, latter, are, not, seen, in, all, cardiac, cell, types, and, the, depolarisation, causes, extracellular, ca, 2, to, enter, the, cell, via, l, type, calcium, channels, and, possibly, sodium, calcium, exchanger, ncx, during, the, early, part, of, the, plateau, phase, although, this, ca, 2, influx, only, count, for, about, 10, of, the, ca, 2, needed, for, activation, it, is, relatively, larger, than, that, of, skeletal, muscle, this, ca, 2, influx, causes, a, small, local, increase, in, intracellular, ca, 2, the, increase, of, intracellular, ca, 2, is, detected, by, ryr2, in, the, membrane, of, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, which, releases, ca, 2, in, a, positive, feedback, physiological, response, this, positive, feedback, is, known, as, calcium, induced, calcium, release, and, gives, rise, to, calcium, sparks, ca, 2, sparks, the, spatial, and, temporal, summation, of, 30, 000, ca, 2, sparks, gives, a, cell, wide, increase, in, cytoplasmic, calcium, concentration, the, increase, in, cytosolic, calcium, following, the, flow, of, calcium, through, the, cell, membrane, and, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, is, moderated, by, calcium, buffers, which, bind, a, large, proportion, of, intracellular, calcium, as, a, result, a, large, increase, in, total, calcium, leads, to, a, relatively, small, rise, in, free, ca, 2, the, cytoplasmic, calcium, binds, to, troponin, c, moving, the, tropomyosin, complex, off, the, actin, binding, site, allowing, the, myosin, head, to, bind, to, the, actin, filament, from, this, point, on, the, contractile, mechanism, is, essentially, the, same, as, for, skeletal, muscle, above, briefly, using, atp, hydrolysis, the, myosin, head, pulls, the, actin, filament, toward, the, centre, of, the, sarcomere, following, systole, intracellular, calcium, is, taken, up, by, the, sarco, endoplasmic, reticulum, atpase, serca, pump, back, into, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, ready, for, the, next, cycle, to, begin, calcium, is, also, ejected, from, the, cell, mainly, by, the, sodium, calcium, exchanger, ncx, and, to, a, lesser, extent, a, plasma, membrane, calcium, atpase, some, calcium, is, also, taken, up, by, the, mitochondria, an, enzyme, phospholamban, serves, as, a, brake, for, serca, at, low, heart, rates, phospholamban, is, active, and, slows, down, the, activity, of, the, atpase, so, that, ca, 2, does, not, have, to, leave, the, cell, entirely, at, high, heart, rates, phospholamban, is, phosphorylated, and, deactivated, thus, taking, most, ca, 2, from, the, cytoplasm, back, into, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, once, again, calcium, buffers, moderate, this, fall, in, ca, 2, concentration, permitting, a, relatively, small, decrease, in, free, ca, 2, concentration, in, response, to, a, large, change, in, total, calcium, the, falling, ca, 2, concentration, allows, the, troponin, complex, to, dissociate, from, the, actin, filament, thereby, ending, contraction, the, heart, relaxes, allowing, the, ventricles, to, fill, with, blood, and, begin, the, cardiac, cycle, again, in, annelids, such, as, earthworms, and, leeches, circular, and, longitudinal, muscles, cells, form, the, body, wall, of, these, animals, and, are, responsible, for, their, movement, in, an, earthworm, that, is, moving, through, a, soil, for, example, contractions, of, circular, and, longitudinal, muscles, occur, reciprocally, while, the, coelomic, fluid, serves, as, a, hydroskeleton, by, maintaining, turgidity, of, the, earthworm, when, the, circular, muscles, in, the, anterior, segments, contract, the, anterior, portion, of, animal, s, body, begins, to, constrict, radially, which, pushes, the, incompressible, coelomic, fluid, forward, and, increasing, the, length, of, the, animal, as, a, result, the, front, end, of, the, animal, moves, forward, as, the, front, end, of, the, earthworm, becomes, anchored, and, the, circular, muscles, in, the, anterior, segments, become, relaxed, a, wave, of, longitudinal, muscle, contractions, passes, backwards, which, pulls, the, rest, of, animal, s, trailing, body, forward, these, alternating, waves, of, circular, and, longitudinal, contractions, is, called, peristalsis, which, underlies, the, creeping, movement, of, earthworms, invertebrates, such, as, annelids, mollusks, and, nematodes, possess, obliquely, striated, muscles, which, contain, bands, of, thick, and, thin, filaments, that, are, arranged, helically, rather, than, transversely, like, in, vertebrate, skeletal, or, cardiac, muscles, in, bivalves, the, obliquely, striated, muscles, can, maintain, tension, over, long, periods, without, using, too, much, energy, bivalves, use, these, muscles, to, keep, their, shells, closed, advanced, insects, such, as, wasps, flies, bees, and, beetles, possess, asynchronous, muscles, that, constitute, the, flight, muscles, in, these, animals, these, flight, muscles, are, often, called, fibrillar, muscles, because, they, contain, myofibrils, that, are, thick, and, conspicuous, a, remarkable, feature, of, these, muscles, is, that, they, do, not, require, stimulation, for, each, muscle, contraction, hence, they, are, called, asynchronous, muscles, because, the, number, of, contractions, in, these, muscles, do, not, correspond, or, synchronize, with, the, number, of, action, potentials, for, example, a, wing, muscle, of, a, tethered, fly, may, receive, action, potentials, at, a, frequency, of, 3, hz, but, it, is, able, to, beat, at, a, frequency, of, 120, hz, the, high, frequency, beating, is, made, possible, because, the, muscles, are, connected, to, a, resonant, system, which, is, driven, to, a, natural, frequency, of, vibration, in, 1780, luigi, galvani, discovered, that, the, muscles, of, dead, frogs, legs, twitched, when, struck, by, an, electrical, spark, this, was, one, of, the, first, forays, into, the, study, of, bioelectricity, a, field, that, still, studies, the, electrical, patterns, and, signals, in, tissues, such, as, nerves, and, muscles, in, 1952, the, term, excitation, contraction, coupling, was, coined, to, describe, the, physiological, process, of, converting, an, electrical, stimulus, to, a, mechanical, response, this, process, is, fundamental, to, muscle, physiology, whereby, the, electrical, stimulus, is, usually, an, action, potential, and, the, mechanical, response, is, contraction, excitation, contraction, coupling, can, be, dysregulated, in, many, diseases, though, excitation, contraction, coupling, has, been, known, for, over, half, a, century, it, is, still, an, active, area, of, biomedical, research, the, general, scheme, is, that, an, action, potential, arrives, to, depolarize, the, cell, membrane, by, mechanisms, specific, to, the, muscle, type, this, depolarization, results, in, an, increase, in, cytosolic, calcium, that, is, called, a, calcium, transient, this, increase, in, calcium, activates, calcium, sensitive, contractile, proteins, that, then, use, atp, to, cause, cell, shortening, the, mechanism, for, muscle, contraction, evaded, scientists, for, years, and, requires, continued, research, and, updating, the, sliding, filament, theory, was, independently, developed, by, andrew, f, huxley, and, rolf, niedergerke, and, by, hugh, huxley, and, jean, hanson, their, findings, were, published, as, two, consecutive, papers, published, in, the, 22, may, 1954, issue, of, nature, under, the, common, theme, structural, changes, in, muscle, during, contraction
