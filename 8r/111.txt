skin, is, the, layer, of, usually, soft, flexible, outer, tissue, covering, the, body, of, a, vertebrate, animal, with, three, main, functions, protection, regulation, and, sensation, other, animal, coverings, such, as, the, arthropod, exoskeleton, have, different, developmental, origin, structure, and, chemical, composition, the, adjective, cutaneous, means, of, the, skin, from, latin, cutis, skin, in, mammals, the, skin, is, an, organ, of, the, integumentary, system, made, up, of, multiple, layers, of, ectodermal, tissue, and, guards, the, underlying, muscles, bones, ligaments, and, internal, organs, skin, of, a, different, nature, exists, in, amphibians, reptiles, and, birds, skin, including, cutaneous, and, subcutaneous, tissues, plays, crucial, roles, in, formation, structure, and, function, of, extraskeletal, apparatus, such, as, horns, of, bovids, e, g, cattle, and, rhinos, cervids, antlers, giraffids, ossicones, armadillos, osteoderm, and, os, penis, os, clitoris, all, mammals, have, some, hair, on, their, skin, even, marine, mammals, like, whales, dolphins, and, porpoises, that, appear, to, be, hairless, the, skin, interfaces, with, the, environment, and, is, the, first, line, of, defense, from, external, factors, for, example, the, skin, plays, a, key, role, in, protecting, the, body, against, pathogens, and, excessive, water, loss, its, other, functions, are, insulation, temperature, regulation, sensation, and, the, production, of, vitamin, d, folates, severely, damaged, skin, may, heal, by, forming, scar, tissue, this, is, sometimes, discoloured, and, depigmented, the, thickness, of, skin, also, varies, from, location, to, location, on, an, organism, in, humans, for, example, the, skin, located, under, the, eyes, and, around, the, eyelids, is, the, thinnest, skin, on, the, body, at, 0, 5, mm, thick, and, is, one, of, the, first, areas, to, show, signs, of, aging, such, as, crows, feet, and, wrinkles, the, skin, on, the, palms, and, the, soles, of, the, feet, is, the, thickest, skin, on, the, body, at, 4, mm, thick, the, speed, and, quality, of, wound, healing, in, skin, is, promoted, by, estrogen, fur, is, dense, hair, primarily, fur, augments, the, insulation, the, skin, provides, but, can, also, serve, as, a, secondary, sexual, characteristic, or, as, camouflage, on, some, animals, the, skin, is, very, hard, and, thick, and, can, be, processed, to, create, leather, reptiles, and, most, fish, have, hard, protective, scales, on, their, skin, for, protection, and, birds, have, hard, feathers, all, made, of, tough, beta, keratins, amphibian, skin, is, not, a, strong, barrier, especially, regarding, the, passage, of, chemicals, via, skin, and, is, often, subject, to, osmosis, and, diffusive, forces, for, example, a, frog, sitting, in, an, anesthetic, solution, would, be, sedated, quickly, as, the, chemical, diffuses, through, its, skin, amphibian, skin, plays, key, roles, in, everyday, survival, and, their, ability, to, exploit, a, wide, range, of, habitats, and, ecological, conditions, on, 11, january, 2024, biologists, reported, the, discovery, of, the, oldest, known, skin, fossilized, about, 289, million, years, ago, and, possibly, the, skin, from, an, ancient, reptile, the, word, skin, originally, only, referred, to, dressed, and, tanned, animal, hide, and, the, usual, word, for, human, skin, was, hide, skin, is, a, borrowing, from, old, norse, skinn, animal, hide, fur, ultimately, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, sek, meaning, to, cut, probably, a, reference, to, the, fact, that, in, those, times, animal, hide, was, commonly, cut, off, to, be, used, as, garment, mammalian, skin, is, composed, of, two, primary, layers, the, epidermis, is, composed, of, the, outermost, layers, of, the, skin, it, forms, a, protective, barrier, over, the, body, s, surface, responsible, for, keeping, water, in, the, body, and, preventing, pathogens, from, entering, and, is, a, stratified, squamous, epithelium, composed, of, proliferating, basal, and, differentiated, suprabasal, keratinocytes, keratinocytes, are, the, major, cells, constituting, 95, of, the, epidermis, while, merkel, cells, melanocytes, and, langerhans, cells, are, also, present, the, epidermis, can, be, further, subdivided, into, the, following, strata, or, layers, beginning, with, the, outermost, layer, keratinocytes, in, the, stratum, basale, proliferate, through, mitosis, and, the, daughter, cells, move, up, the, strata, changing, shape, and, composition, as, they, undergo, multiple, stages, of, cell, differentiation, to, eventually, become, anucleated, during, that, process, keratinocytes, will, become, highly, organized, forming, cellular, junctions, desmosomes, between, each, other, and, secreting, keratin, proteins, and, lipids, which, contribute, to, the, formation, of, an, extracellular, matrix, and, provide, mechanical, strength, to, the, skin, keratinocytes, from, the, stratum, corneum, are, eventually, shed, from, the, surface, desquamation, the, epidermis, contains, no, blood, vessels, and, cells, in, the, deepest, layers, are, nourished, by, diffusion, from, blood, capillaries, extending, to, the, upper, layers, of, the, dermis, the, epidermis, and, dermis, are, separated, by, a, thin, sheet, of, fibers, called, the, basement, membrane, which, is, made, through, the, action, of, both, tissues, the, basement, membrane, controls, the, traffic, of, the, cells, and, molecules, between, the, dermis, and, epidermis, but, also, serves, through, the, binding, of, a, variety, of, cytokines, and, growth, factors, as, a, reservoir, for, their, controlled, release, during, physiological, remodeling, or, repair, processes, the, dermis, is, the, layer, of, skin, beneath, the, epidermis, that, consists, of, connective, tissue, and, cushions, the, body, from, stress, and, strain, the, dermis, provides, tensile, strength, and, elasticity, to, the, skin, through, an, extracellular, matrix, composed, of, collagen, fibrils, microfibrils, and, elastic, fibers, embedded, in, hyaluronan, and, proteoglycans, skin, proteoglycans, are, varied, and, have, very, specific, locations, for, example, hyaluronan, versican, and, decorin, are, present, throughout, the, dermis, and, epidermis, extracellular, matrix, whereas, biglycan, and, perlecan, are, only, found, in, the, epidermis, it, harbors, many, mechanoreceptors, nerve, endings, that, provide, the, sense, of, touch, and, heat, through, nociceptors, and, thermoreceptors, it, also, contains, the, hair, follicles, sweat, glands, sebaceous, glands, apocrine, glands, lymphatic, vessels, and, blood, vessels, the, blood, vessels, in, the, dermis, provide, nourishment, and, waste, removal, from, its, own, cells, as, well, as, for, the, epidermis, dermis, and, subcutaneous, tissues, are, thought, to, contain, germinative, cells, involved, in, formation, of, horns, osteoderm, and, other, extra, skeletal, apparatus, in, mammals, the, dermis, is, tightly, connected, to, the, epidermis, through, a, basement, membrane, and, is, structurally, divided, into, two, areas, a, superficial, area, adjacent, to, the, epidermis, called, the, papillary, region, and, a, deep, thicker, area, known, as, the, reticular, region, the, papillary, region, is, composed, of, loose, areolar, connective, tissue, this, is, named, for, its, fingerlike, projections, called, papillae, that, extend, toward, the, epidermis, the, papillae, provide, the, dermis, with, a, bumpy, surface, that, interdigitates, with, the, epidermis, strengthening, the, connection, between, the, two, layers, of, skin, the, reticular, region, lies, deep, in, the, papillary, region, and, is, usually, much, thicker, it, is, composed, of, dense, irregular, connective, tissue, and, receives, its, name, from, the, dense, concentration, of, collagenous, elastic, and, reticular, fibers, that, weave, throughout, it, these, protein, fibers, give, the, dermis, its, properties, of, strength, extensibility, and, elasticity, also, located, within, the, reticular, region, are, the, roots, of, the, hair, sweat, glands, sebaceous, glands, receptors, nails, and, blood, vessels, the, subcutaneous, tissue, also, hypodermis, is, not, part, of, the, skin, and, lies, below, the, dermis, its, purpose, is, to, attach, the, skin, to, underlying, bone, and, muscle, as, well, as, supplying, it, with, blood, vessels, and, nerves, it, consists, of, loose, connective, tissue, and, elastin, the, main, cell, types, are, fibroblasts, macrophages, and, adipocytes, the, subcutaneous, tissue, contains, 50, of, body, fat, fat, serves, as, padding, and, insulation, for, the, body, microorganisms, like, staphylococcus, epidermis, colonize, the, skin, surface, the, density, of, skin, flora, depends, on, region, of, the, skin, the, disinfected, skin, surface, gets, recolonized, from, bacteria, residing, in, the, deeper, areas, of, the, hair, follicle, gut, and, urogenital, openings, the, epidermis, of, fish, and, of, most, amphibians, consists, entirely, of, live, cells, with, only, minimal, quantities, of, keratin, in, the, cells, of, the, superficial, layer, it, is, generally, permeable, and, in, the, case, of, many, amphibians, may, actually, be, a, major, respiratory, organ, the, dermis, of, bony, fish, typically, contains, relatively, little, of, the, connective, tissue, found, in, tetrapods, instead, in, most, species, it, is, largely, replaced, by, solid, protective, bony, scales, apart, from, some, particularly, large, dermal, bones, that, form, parts, of, the, skull, these, scales, are, lost, in, tetrapods, although, many, reptiles, do, have, scales, of, a, different, kind, as, do, pangolins, cartilaginous, fish, have, numerous, tooth, like, denticles, embedded, in, their, skin, in, place, of, true, scales, sweat, glands, and, sebaceous, glands, are, both, unique, to, mammals, but, other, types, of, skin, gland, are, found, in, other, vertebrates, fish, typically, have, a, numerous, individual, mucus, secreting, skin, cells, that, aid, in, insulation, and, protection, but, may, also, have, poison, glands, photophores, or, cells, that, produce, a, more, watery, serous, fluid, in, amphibians, the, mucus, cells, are, gathered, together, to, form, sac, like, glands, most, living, amphibians, also, possess, granular, glands, in, the, skin, that, secrete, irritating, or, toxic, compounds, although, melanin, is, found, in, the, skin, of, many, species, in, the, reptiles, the, amphibians, and, fish, the, epidermis, is, often, relatively, colorless, instead, the, color, of, the, skin, is, largely, due, to, chromatophores, in, the, dermis, which, in, addition, to, melanin, may, contain, guanine, or, carotenoid, pigments, many, species, such, as, chameleons, and, flounders, may, be, able, to, change, the, color, of, their, skin, by, adjusting, the, relative, size, of, their, chromatophores, amphibians, possess, two, types, of, glands, mucous, and, granular, serous, both, of, these, glands, are, part, of, the, integument, and, thus, considered, cutaneous, mucous, and, granular, glands, are, both, divided, into, three, different, sections, which, all, connect, to, structure, the, gland, as, a, whole, the, three, individual, parts, of, the, gland, are, the, duct, the, intercalary, region, and, lastly, the, alveolar, gland, sac, structurally, the, duct, is, derived, via, keratinocytes, and, passes, through, to, the, surface, of, the, epidermal, or, outer, skin, layer, thus, allowing, external, secretions, of, the, body, the, gland, alveolus, is, a, sac, shaped, structure, that, is, found, on, the, bottom, or, base, region, of, the, granular, gland, the, cells, in, this, sac, specialize, in, secretion, between, the, alveolar, gland, and, the, duct, is, the, intercalary, system, which, can, be, summed, up, as, a, transitional, region, connecting, the, duct, to, the, grand, alveolar, beneath, the, epidermal, skin, layer, in, general, granular, glands, are, larger, in, size, than, the, mucous, glands, which, are, greater, in, number, granular, glands, can, be, identified, as, venomous, and, often, differ, in, the, type, of, toxin, as, well, as, the, concentrations, of, secretions, across, various, orders, and, species, within, the, amphibians, they, are, located, in, clusters, differing, in, concentration, depending, on, amphibian, taxa, the, toxins, can, be, fatal, to, most, vertebrates, or, have, no, effect, against, others, these, glands, are, alveolar, meaning, they, structurally, have, little, sacs, in, which, venom, is, produced, and, held, before, it, is, secreted, upon, defensive, behaviors, structurally, the, ducts, of, the, granular, gland, initially, maintain, a, cylindrical, shape, when, the, ducts, mature, and, fill, with, fluid, the, base, of, the, ducts, become, swollen, due, to, the, pressure, from, the, inside, this, causes, the, epidermal, layer, to, form, a, pit, like, opening, on, the, surface, of, the, duct, in, which, the, inner, fluid, will, be, secreted, in, an, upwards, fashion, the, intercalary, region, of, granular, glands, is, more, developed, and, mature, in, comparison, with, mucous, glands, this, region, resides, as, a, ring, of, cells, surrounding, the, basal, portion, of, the, duct, which, are, argued, to, have, an, ectodermal, muscular, nature, due, to, their, influence, over, the, lumen, space, inside, the, tube, of, the, duct, with, dilation, and, constriction, functions, during, secretions, the, cells, are, found, radially, around, the, duct, and, provide, a, distinct, attachment, site, for, muscle, fibers, around, the, gland, s, body, the, gland, alveolus, is, a, sac, that, is, divided, into, three, specific, regions, layers, the, outer, layer, or, tunica, fibrosa, is, composed, of, densely, packed, connective, tissue, which, connects, with, fibers, from, the, spongy, intermediate, layer, where, elastic, fibers, as, well, as, nerves, reside, the, nerves, send, signals, to, the, muscles, as, well, as, the, epithelial, layers, lastly, the, epithelium, or, tunica, propria, encloses, the, gland, mucous, glands, are, non, venomous, and, offer, a, different, functionality, for, amphibians, than, granular, mucous, glands, cover, the, entire, surface, area, of, the, amphibian, body, and, specialize, in, keeping, the, body, lubricated, there, are, many, other, functions, of, the, mucous, glands, such, as, controlling, the, ph, thermoregulation, adhesive, properties, to, the, environment, anti, predator, behaviors, slimy, to, the, grasp, chemical, communication, even, anti, bacterial, viral, properties, for, protection, against, pathogens, the, ducts, of, the, mucous, gland, appear, as, cylindrical, vertical, tubes, that, break, through, the, epidermal, layer, to, the, surface, of, the, skin, the, cells, lining, the, inside, of, the, ducts, are, oriented, with, their, longitudinal, axis, forming, 90, degree, angles, surrounding, the, duct, in, a, helical, fashion, intercalary, cells, react, identically, to, those, of, granular, glands, but, on, a, smaller, scale, among, the, amphibians, there, are, taxa, which, contain, a, modified, intercalary, region, depending, on, the, function, of, the, glands, yet, the, majority, share, the, same, structure, the, alveolar, or, mucous, glands, are, much, more, simple, and, only, consist, of, an, epithelium, layer, as, well, as, connective, tissue, which, forms, a, cover, over, the, gland, this, gland, lacks, a, tunica, propria, and, appears, to, have, delicate, and, intricate, fibers, which, pass, over, the, gland, s, muscle, and, epithelial, layers, the, epidermis, of, birds, and, reptiles, is, closer, to, that, of, mammals, with, a, layer, of, dead, keratin, filled, cells, at, the, surface, to, help, reduce, water, loss, a, similar, pattern, is, also, seen, in, some, of, the, more, terrestrial, amphibians, such, as, toads, in, these, animals, there, is, no, clear, differentiation, of, the, epidermis, into, distinct, layers, as, occurs, in, humans, with, the, change, in, cell, type, being, relatively, gradual, the, mammalian, epidermis, always, possesses, at, least, a, stratum, germinativum, and, stratum, corneum, but, the, other, intermediate, layers, found, in, humans, are, not, always, distinguishable, hair, is, a, distinctive, feature, of, mammalian, skin, while, feathers, are, at, least, among, living, species, similarly, unique, to, birds, birds, and, reptiles, have, relatively, few, skin, glands, although, there, may, be, a, few, structures, for, specific, purposes, such, as, pheromone, secreting, cells, in, some, reptiles, or, the, uropygial, gland, of, most, birds, cutaneous, structures, arise, from, the, epidermis, and, include, a, variety, of, features, such, as, hair, feathers, claws, and, nails, during, embryogenesis, the, epidermis, splits, into, two, layers, the, periderm, which, is, lost, and, the, basal, layer, the, basal, layer, is, a, stem, cell, layer, and, through, asymmetrical, divisions, becomes, the, source, of, skin, cells, throughout, life, it, is, maintained, as, a, stem, cell, layer, through, an, autocrine, signal, tgf, alpha, and, through, paracrine, signaling, from, fgf7, keratinocyte, growth, factor, produced, by, the, dermis, below, the, basal, cells, in, mice, over, expression, of, these, factors, leads, to, an, overproduction, of, granular, cells, and, thick, skin, hair, and, feathers, are, formed, in, a, regular, pattern, and, it, is, believed, to, be, the, result, of, a, reaction, diffusion, system, this, reaction, diffusion, system, combines, an, activator, sonic, hedgehog, with, an, inhibitor, bmp4, or, bmp2, to, form, clusters, of, cells, in, a, regular, pattern, sonic, hedgehog, expressing, epidermal, cells, induce, the, condensation, of, cells, in, the, mesoderm, the, clusters, of, mesodermal, cells, signal, back, to, the, epidermis, to, form, the, appropriate, structure, for, that, position, bmp, signals, from, the, epidermis, inhibit, the, formation, of, placodes, in, nearby, ectoderm, it, is, believed, that, the, mesoderm, defines, the, pattern, the, epidermis, instructs, the, mesodermal, cells, to, condense, and, then, the, mesoderm, instructs, the, epidermis, of, what, structure, to, make, through, a, series, of, reciprocal, inductions, transplantation, experiments, involving, frog, and, newt, epidermis, indicated, that, the, mesodermal, signals, are, conserved, between, species, but, the, epidermal, response, is, species, specific, meaning, that, the, mesoderm, instructs, the, epidermis, of, its, position, and, the, epidermis, uses, this, information, to, make, a, specific, structure, skin, performs, the, following, functions, skin, is, a, soft, tissue, and, exhibits, key, mechanical, behaviors, of, these, tissues, the, most, pronounced, feature, is, the, j, curve, stress, strain, response, in, which, a, region, of, large, strain, and, minimal, stress, exists, and, corresponds, to, the, microstructural, straightening, and, reorientation, of, collagen, fibrils, in, some, cases, the, intact, skin, is, prestreched, like, wetsuits, around, the, diver, s, body, and, in, other, cases, the, intact, skin, is, under, compression, small, circular, holes, punched, on, the, skin, may, widen, or, close, into, ellipses, or, shrink, and, remain, circular, depending, on, preexisting, stresses, tissue, homeostasis, generally, declines, with, age, in, part, because, stem, progenitor, cells, fail, to, self, renew, or, differentiate, skin, aging, is, caused, in, part, by, tgf, by, blocking, the, conversion, of, dermal, fibroblasts, into, fat, cells, which, provide, support, common, changes, in, the, skin, as, a, result, of, aging, range, from, wrinkles, discoloration, and, skin, laxity, but, can, manifest, in, more, severe, forms, such, as, skin, malignancies, moreover, these, factors, may, be, worsened, by, sun, exposure, in, a, process, known, as, photoaging
