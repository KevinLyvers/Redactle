the, common, ostrich, struthio, camelus, or, simply, ostrich, is, a, species, of, flightless, bird, native, to, certain, large, areas, of, africa, it, is, one, of, two, extant, species, of, ostriches, the, only, living, members, of, the, genus, struthio, in, the, ratite, order, of, birds, the, other, is, the, somali, ostrich, struthio, molybdophanes, which, was, recognized, as, a, distinct, species, by, birdlife, international, in, 2014, having, been, previously, considered, a, distinctive, subspecies, of, ostrich, the, common, ostrich, belongs, to, the, order, struthioniformes, struthioniformes, previously, contained, all, the, ratites, such, as, the, kiwis, emus, rheas, and, cassowaries, however, recent, genetic, analysis, has, found, that, the, group, is, not, monophyletic, as, it, is, paraphyletic, with, respect, to, the, tinamous, so, the, ostriches, are, now, classified, as, the, only, members, of, the, order, phylogenetic, studies, have, shown, that, it, is, the, sister, group, to, all, other, members, of, palaeognathae, and, thus, the, flighted, tinamous, are, the, sister, group, to, the, extinct, moa, it, is, distinctive, in, its, appearance, with, a, long, neck, and, legs, and, can, run, for, a, long, time, at, a, speed, of, 55, km, h, 34, mph, with, short, bursts, up, to, about, 70, km, h, 40, mph, the, fastest, land, speed, of, any, bird, the, common, ostrich, is, the, largest, living, species, of, bird, and, largest, living, dinosaur, it, lays, the, largest, eggs, of, any, living, bird, the, extinct, giant, elephant, bird, aepyornis, maximus, of, madagascar, and, the, south, island, giant, moa, dinornis, robustus, of, new, zealand, laid, larger, eggs, ostriches, are, the, most, dangerous, birds, on, the, planet, with, an, average, of, two, to, three, deaths, being, recorded, each, year, in, south, africa, the, common, ostrich, s, diet, consists, mainly, of, plant, matter, though, it, also, eats, invertebrates, and, small, reptiles, it, lives, in, nomadic, groups, of, 5, to, 50, birds, when, threatened, the, ostrich, will, either, hide, itself, by, lying, flat, against, the, ground, or, run, away, if, cornered, it, can, attack, with, a, kick, of, its, powerful, legs, mating, patterns, differ, by, geographical, region, but, territorial, males, fight, for, a, harem, of, two, to, seven, females, the, common, ostrich, is, farmed, around, the, world, particularly, for, its, feathers, which, are, decorative, and, are, also, used, as, feather, dusters, its, skin, is, used, for, leather, products, and, its, meat, is, marketed, commercially, with, its, leanness, a, common, marketing, point, the, common, ostrich, is, the, largest, and, heaviest, living, bird, males, stand, 2, 1, to, 2, 75, m, 6, ft, 11, in, to, 9, ft, 0, in, tall, and, weigh, 100, to, 130, kilograms, 220, 290, lb, whereas, females, are, about, 1, 75, to, 1, 9, m, 5, ft, 9, in, to, 6, ft, 3, in, tall, and, weigh, 90, to, 120, kilograms, 200, 260, lb, while, exceptional, male, ostriches, in, the, nominate, subspecies, can, weigh, up, to, 156, 8, kg, 346, lb, some, specimens, in, south, africa, can, only, weigh, between, 59, 5, to, 81, 3, kilograms, 131, 179, lb, new, chicks, are, fawn, in, color, with, dark, brown, spots, after, three, months, they, start, to, gain, their, juvenile, plumage, which, is, steadily, replaced, by, adult, like, plumage, during, their, second, year, at, four, or, five, months, old, they, are, already, about, half, the, size, of, an, adult, bird, and, after, a, year, they, reach, adult, height, but, not, till, they, are, 18, months, old, will, they, be, fully, as, heavy, as, their, parents, the, feathers, of, adult, males, are, mostly, black, with, white, primaries, and, a, white, tail, however, the, tail, of, one, subspecies, is, buff, females, and, young, males, are, grayish, brown, and, white, the, head, and, neck, of, both, male, and, female, ostriches, are, nearly, bare, with, a, thin, layer, of, down, the, skin, of, the, female, s, neck, and, thighs, is, pinkish, gray, while, the, male, s, is, gray, or, pink, dependent, on, subspecies, the, long, neck, and, legs, keep, their, head, up, to, 2, 8, m, 9, ft, 2, in, above, the, ground, and, their, eyes, are, said, to, be, the, largest, of, any, land, vertebrate, 50, mm, 2, in, in, diameter, helping, them, to, see, predators, at, a, great, distance, the, eyes, are, shaded, from, sunlight, from, above, however, the, head, and, bill, are, relatively, small, for, the, birds, huge, size, with, the, bill, measuring, 12, to, 14, 3, cm, 4, 3, 4, to, 5, 3, 4, in, their, skin, varies, in, color, depending, on, the, subspecies, with, some, having, light, or, dark, gray, skin, and, others, having, pinkish, or, even, reddish, skin, the, strong, legs, of, the, common, ostrich, are, unfeathered, and, show, bare, skin, with, the, tarsus, the, lowest, upright, part, of, the, leg, being, covered, in, scales, red, in, the, male, black, in, the, female, the, tarsus, of, the, common, ostrich, is, the, largest, of, any, living, bird, measuring, 39, to, 53, cm, 15, 1, 2, to, 21, in, in, length, the, bird, is, didactyl, having, just, two, toes, on, each, foot, most, birds, have, four, with, the, nail, on, the, larger, inner, toe, resembling, a, hoof, the, outer, toe, has, no, nail, the, reduced, number, of, toes, is, an, adaptation, that, appears, to, aid, in, running, useful, for, getting, away, from, predators, common, ostriches, can, run, at, a, speed, over, 70, km, h, 40, mph, and, can, cover, 3, to, 5, m, 10, to, 15, ft, in, a, single, stride, the, wings, reach, a, span, of, about, two, metres, 6, 1, 2, ft, and, the, wing, chord, measurement, of, 90, cm, 35, in, is, around, the, same, size, as, for, the, largest, flying, birds, the, feathers, lack, the, tiny, hooks, that, lock, together, the, smooth, external, feathers, of, flying, birds, and, so, are, soft, and, fluffy, and, serve, as, insulation, common, ostriches, can, tolerate, a, wide, range, of, temperatures, in, much, of, their, habitat, temperatures, vary, as, much, as, 40, c, 70, f, between, night, and, day, their, temperature, control, relies, in, part, on, behavioral, thermoregulation, for, example, they, use, their, wings, to, cover, the, naked, skin, of, the, upper, legs, and, flanks, to, conserve, heat, or, leave, these, areas, bare, to, release, heat, the, wings, also, function, as, stabilizers, to, give, better, maneuverability, when, running, tests, have, shown, that, the, wings, are, actively, involved, in, rapid, braking, turning, and, zigzag, maneuvers, they, have, 50, 60, tail, feathers, and, their, wings, have, 16, primary, four, alular, and, 20, 23, secondary, feathers, the, common, ostrich, s, sternum, is, flat, lacking, the, keel, to, which, wing, muscles, attach, in, flying, birds, the, beak, is, flat, and, broad, with, a, rounded, tip, like, all, ratites, the, ostrich, has, no, crop, and, it, also, lacks, a, gallbladder, and, the, caecum, is, 71, cm, 28, in, unlike, all, other, living, birds, the, common, ostrich, secretes, urine, separately, from, feces, all, other, birds, store, the, urine, and, feces, combined, in, the, coprodeum, but, the, ostrich, stores, the, feces, in, the, terminal, rectum, they, also, have, unique, pubic, bones, that, are, fused, to, hold, their, gut, unlike, most, birds, the, males, have, a, copulatory, organ, which, is, retractable, and, 20, cm, 8, in, long, their, palate, differs, from, other, ratites, in, that, the, sphenoid, and, palatal, bones, are, unconnected, the, common, ostrich, was, originally, described, by, carl, linnaeus, from, sweden, in, his, 18th, century, work, systema, naturae, under, its, current, binomial, name, its, genus, is, derived, from, the, late, latin, struthio, meaning, ostrich, the, specific, name, is, an, allusion, to, strouthokamelos, the, ancient, greek, name, for, the, ostrich, meaning, camel, sparrow, the, camel, term, referring, to, its, dry, habitat, is, still, the, modern, greek, name, for, the, ostrich, the, common, ostrich, belongs, to, the, infraclass, palaeognathae, commonly, known, as, ratites, other, members, include, rheas, emus, cassowaries, moa, kiwi, elephant, birds, tinamous, four, subspecies, are, recognized, some, analyses, indicate, that, the, somali, ostrich, is, now, considered, a, full, species, the, tree, of, life, project, the, clements, checklist, of, birds, of, the, world, birdlife, international, and, the, ioc, world, bird, list, recognize, it, as, a, different, species, a, few, authorities, including, the, howard, and, moore, complete, checklist, of, the, birds, of, the, world, do, not, recognize, it, as, separate, mitochondrial, dna, haplotype, comparisons, suggest, that, it, diverged, from, the, other, ostriches, not, quite, 4, mya, due, to, formation, of, the, east, african, rift, hybridization, with, the, subspecies, that, evolved, southwestwards, of, its, range, s, c, massaicus, has, apparently, been, prevented, from, occurring, on, a, significant, scale, by, ecological, separation, the, somali, ostrich, prefers, bushland, where, it, browses, middle, height, vegetation, for, food, while, the, masai, ostrich, is, like, the, other, subspecies, a, grazing, bird, of, the, open, savanna, and, miombo, habitat, the, population, from, r, o, de, oro, was, once, separated, as, struthio, camelus, spatzi, because, its, eggshell, pores, were, shaped, like, a, teardrop, and, not, round, as, there, is, considerable, variation, of, this, character, and, there, were, no, other, differences, between, these, birds, and, adjacent, populations, of, s, c, camelus, the, separation, is, no, longer, considered, valid, however, a, study, analysing, the, postcranial, skeleton, of, all, living, and, recently, extinct, species, and, subspecies, of, ostriches, appeared, to, validate, s, c, spatzi, based, on, its, unique, skeletal, proportions, this, population, disappeared, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, there, were, 19th, century, reports, of, the, existence, of, small, ostriches, in, north, africa, these, are, referred, to, as, levaillant, s, ostrich, struthio, bidactylus, but, remain, a, hypothetical, form, not, supported, by, material, evidence, common, ostriches, formerly, occupied, africa, north, and, south, of, the, sahara, east, africa, africa, south, of, the, rainforest, belt, and, much, of, asia, minor, today, common, ostriches, prefer, open, land, and, are, native, to, the, savannas, and, sahel, of, africa, both, north, and, south, of, the, equatorial, forest, zone, in, southwest, africa, they, inhabit, the, semi, desert, or, true, desert, farmed, common, ostriches, in, australia, have, established, feral, populations, the, arabian, ostriches, in, the, near, and, middle, east, were, hunted, to, extinction, by, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, attempts, to, reintroduce, the, common, ostrich, into, israel, have, failed, common, ostriches, have, occasionally, been, seen, inhabiting, islands, on, the, dahlak, archipelago, in, the, red, sea, near, eritrea, research, conducted, by, the, birbal, sahni, institute, of, palaeobotany, in, india, found, molecular, evidence, that, ostriches, lived, in, india, 25, 000, years, ago, dna, tests, on, fossilized, eggshells, recovered, from, eight, archaeological, sites, in, the, states, of, rajasthan, gujarat, and, madhya, pradesh, found, 92, genetic, similarity, between, the, eggshells, and, the, north, african, ostrich, so, these, could, have, been, fairly, distant, relatives, ostriches, are, farmed, in, australia, many, escaped, however, and, feral, ostriches, now, roam, the, australian, outback, common, ostriches, normally, spend, the, winter, months, in, pairs, or, alone, only, 16, percent, of, common, ostrich, sightings, were, of, more, than, two, birds, during, breeding, season, and, sometimes, during, extreme, rainless, periods, ostriches, live, in, nomadic, groups, of, five, to, 100, birds, led, by, a, top, hen, that, often, travel, together, with, other, grazing, animals, such, as, zebras, or, antelopes, ostriches, are, diurnal, but, may, be, active, on, moonlit, nights, they, are, most, active, early, and, late, in, the, day, the, male, common, ostrich, territory, is, between, two, and, twenty, square, kilometres, 3, 4, and, 7, 3, 4, sq, mi, with, their, acute, eyesight, and, hearing, common, ostriches, can, sense, predators, such, as, lions, from, far, away, when, being, pursued, by, a, predator, they, have, been, known, to, reach, speeds, in, excess, of, 70, km, h, 40, mph, or, possibly, 80, km, h, 50, mph, and, can, maintain, a, steady, speed, of, 50, km, h, 30, mph, which, makes, the, common, ostrich, the, world, s, fastest, two, legged, animal, when, lying, down, and, hiding, from, predators, the, birds, lay, their, heads, and, necks, flat, on, the, ground, making, them, appear, like, a, mound, of, earth, from, a, distance, aided, by, the, heat, haze, in, their, hot, dry, habitat, when, threatened, common, ostriches, run, away, but, they, can, cause, serious, injury, and, death, with, kicks, from, their, powerful, legs, their, legs, can, only, kick, forward, the, kick, from, an, ostrich, can, yield, 225, kgf, they, mainly, feed, on, seeds, shrubs, grass, fruit, and, flowers, occasionally, they, also, eat, insects, such, as, locusts, small, reptiles, such, as, lizards, and, occasionally, animal, remains, left, by, carnivorous, predators, lacking, teeth, they, swallow, pebbles, that, act, as, gastroliths, to, grind, food, in, the, gizzard, when, eating, they, will, fill, their, gullet, with, food, which, is, in, turn, passed, down, their, esophagus, in, the, form, of, a, ball, called, a, bolus, the, bolus, may, be, as, much, as, 210, ml, 13, cu, in, after, passing, through, the, neck, there, is, no, crop, the, food, enters, the, gizzard, and, is, worked, on, by, the, aforementioned, pebbles, the, gizzard, can, hold, as, much, as, 1, 300, g, 2, lb, 14, oz, of, which, up, to, 45, may, be, sand, and, pebbles, common, ostriches, can, go, without, drinking, for, several, days, using, metabolic, water, and, moisture, in, ingested, plants, but, they, enjoy, liquid, water, and, frequently, take, baths, where, it, is, available, they, can, survive, losing, up, to, 25, of, their, body, weight, through, dehydration, common, ostriches, become, sexually, mature, when, they, are, 2, to, 4, years, old, females, mature, about, six, months, earlier, than, males, as, with, other, birds, an, individual, may, reproduce, several, times, over, its, lifetime, the, mating, season, begins, in, march, or, april, and, ends, sometime, before, september, the, mating, process, differs, in, different, geographical, regions, territorial, males, typically, boom, by, inflating, their, neck, in, defense, of, their, territory, and, harem, of, two, to, seven, hens, the, successful, male, may, then, mate, with, several, females, in, the, area, but, will, only, form, a, pair, bond, with, a, major, female, the, cock, performs, with, his, wings, alternating, wing, beats, until, he, attracts, a, mate, they, will, go, to, the, mating, area, and, he, will, maintain, privacy, by, driving, away, all, intruders, they, graze, until, their, behavior, is, synchronized, then, the, feeding, becomes, secondary, and, the, process, takes, on, a, ritualistic, appearance, the, cock, will, then, excitedly, flap, alternate, wings, again, and, start, poking, on, the, ground, with, his, bill, he, will, then, violently, flap, his, wings, to, symbolically, clear, out, a, nest, in, the, soil, then, while, the, hen, runs, a, circle, around, him, with, lowered, wings, he, will, wind, his, head, in, a, spiral, motion, she, will, drop, to, the, ground, and, he, will, mount, for, copulation, common, ostriches, raised, entirely, by, humans, may, direct, their, courtship, behavior, not, at, other, ostriches, but, toward, their, human, keepers, the, female, common, ostrich, lays, her, fertilized, eggs, in, a, single, communal, nest, a, simple, pit, 30, to, 60, cm, 12, 24, in, deep, and, 3, m, 10, ft, wide, scraped, in, the, ground, by, the, male, the, dominant, female, lays, her, eggs, first, when, it, is, time, to, cover, them, for, incubation, she, discards, extra, eggs, from, the, weaker, females, leaving, about, 20, in, most, cases, a, female, common, ostrich, can, distinguish, her, own, eggs, from, the, others, in, a, communal, nest, ostrich, eggs, are, the, largest, of, all, eggs, though, they, are, actually, the, smallest, eggs, relative, to, the, size, of, the, adult, bird, on, average, they, are, 15, cm, 6, in, long, 13, cm, 5, in, wide, and, weigh, 1, 4, kg, 3, lb, over, 20, times, the, weight, of, a, chicken, s, egg, and, only, 1, to, 4, the, size, of, the, female, they, are, glossy, cream, colored, with, thick, shells, marked, by, small, pits, the, eggs, are, incubated, by, the, females, by, day, and, by, the, males, by, night, this, uses, the, coloration, of, the, two, sexes, to, escape, detection, of, the, nest, the, drab, female, blends, in, with, the, sand, while, the, black, male, is, nearly, undetectable, in, the, night, the, incubation, period, is, 35, to, 45, days, which, is, rather, short, compared, to, other, ratites, this, is, believed, to, be, the, case, due, to, the, high, rate, of, predation, typically, the, male, defends, the, hatchlings, and, teaches, them, to, feed, although, males, and, females, cooperate, in, rearing, chicks, fewer, than, 10, of, nests, survive, the, 9, week, period, of, laying, and, incubation, and, of, the, surviving, chicks, only, 15, of, those, survive, to, 1, year, of, age, however, among, those, common, ostriches, who, survive, to, adulthood, the, species, is, one, of, the, longest, living, bird, species, common, ostriches, in, captivity, have, lived, to, 62, years, and, 7, months, as, a, flightless, species, in, the, rich, biozone, of, the, african, savanna, the, common, ostrich, faces, a, variety, of, formidable, predators, throughout, its, life, cycle, animals, that, prey, on, ostriches, of, all, ages, may, include, cheetahs, lions, leopards, african, hunting, dogs, and, spotted, hyenas, predators, of, nests, and, young, common, ostriches, include, jackals, various, birds, of, prey, warthogs, mongoose, and, egyptian, vultures, egyptian, vultures, have, been, known, to, hurl, stones, at, ostrich, eggs, to, crack, them, open, so, they, can, eat, their, contents, due, to, predation, pressure, common, ostriches, have, many, antipredator, tactics, though, they, can, deliver, formidable, kicks, they, use, their, great, eyesight, and, speed, to, run, from, most, of, their, predators, since, ostriches, that, have, detected, predators, are, almost, impossible, to, catch, most, predators, will, try, to, ambush, an, unsuspecting, bird, using, obstructing, vegetation, or, other, objects, some, ostriches, forage, with, other, ostriches, or, mammals, such, as, wildebeests, and, zebras, to, detect, predators, more, efficiently, if, the, nest, or, young, are, threatened, either, or, both, of, the, parents, may, create, a, distraction, feigning, injury, however, they, may, sometimes, fiercely, fight, predators, especially, when, chicks, are, being, defended, and, are, capable, of, killing, humans, hyenas, and, even, lions, in, such, confrontations, in, non, native, areas, especially, on, ostrich, farms, in, north, america, adult, ostriches, have, no, known, enemies, due, to, their, large, size, intimidating, presence, and, behaviour, similar, to, that, of, overgrown, guard, dogs, with, instances, of, them, attacking, and, decapitating, coyotes, on, one, occasion, usually, ostrich, hunting, is, done, by, male, cheetah, coalitions, in, the, kalahari, region, during, the, night, when, ostrich, s, vigilance, is, less, effective, cheetahs, in, other, regions, rarely, hunt, ostriches, but, an, exceptional, coalition, composed, of, three, east, african, cheetahs, has, been, reported, in, kenya, similarly, lions, hunt, ostriches, mainly, in, the, kalahari, region, and, not, in, other, regions, or, take, ostriches, as, only, a, small, percentage, of, their, prey, overall, due, to, their, speed, vigilance, and, possibly, dangerous, kick, ostriches, are, usually, avoided, by, most, predators, including, lions, leopards, wild, dogs, and, cheetahs, despite, parental, care, 90, is, typical, for, chick, mortality, most, of, it, caused, by, predation, morphology, of, the, common, ostrich, lung, indicates, that, the, structure, conforms, to, that, of, the, other, avian, species, but, still, retains, parts, of, its, primitive, avian, species, ratite, structure, the, opening, to, the, respiratory, pathway, begins, with, the, laryngeal, cavity, lying, posterior, to, the, choanae, within, the, buccal, cavity, the, tip, of, the, tongue, then, lies, anterior, to, the, choanae, excluding, the, nasal, respiratory, pathway, from, the, buccal, cavity, the, trachea, lies, ventrally, to, the, cervical, vertebrae, extending, from, the, larynx, to, the, syrinx, where, the, trachea, enters, the, thorax, dividing, into, two, primary, bronchi, one, to, each, lung, in, which, they, continue, directly, through, to, become, mesobronchi, ten, different, air, sacs, attach, to, the, lungs, to, form, areas, for, respiration, the, most, posterior, air, sacs, abdominal, and, post, thoracic, differ, in, that, the, right, abdominal, air, sac, is, relatively, small, lying, to, the, right, of, the, mesentery, and, dorsally, to, the, liver, while, the, left, abdominal, air, sac, is, large, and, lies, to, the, left, of, the, mesentery, the, connection, from, the, main, mesobronchi, to, the, more, anterior, air, sacs, including, the, interclavicular, lateral, clavicular, and, pre, thoracic, sacs, known, as, the, ventrobronchi, region, while, the, caudal, end, of, the, mesobronchus, branches, into, several, dorsobronchi, together, the, ventrobronchi, and, dorsobronchi, are, connected, by, intra, pulmonary, airways, the, parabronchi, which, form, an, arcade, structure, within, the, lung, called, the, paleopulmo, it, is, the, only, structure, found, in, primitive, birds, such, as, ratites, the, largest, air, sacs, found, within, the, respiratory, system, are, those, of, the, post, thoracic, region, while, the, others, decrease, in, size, respectively, the, interclavicular, unpaired, abdominal, pre, thoracic, and, lateral, clavicular, sacs, the, adult, common, ostrich, lung, lacks, connective, tissue, known, as, interparabronchial, septa, which, render, strength, to, the, non, compliant, avian, lung, in, other, bird, species, due, to, this, the, lack, of, connective, tissue, surrounding, the, parabronchi, and, adjacent, parabronchial, lumen, they, exchange, blood, capillaries, or, avascular, epithelial, plates, like, mammals, ostrich, lungs, contain, an, abundance, of, type, ii, cells, at, gas, exchange, sites, an, adaptation, for, preventing, lung, collapse, during, slight, volume, changes, the, common, ostrich, is, an, endotherm, and, maintains, a, body, temperature, of, 38, 1, 39, 7, c, 100, 6, 103, 5, f, in, its, extreme, living, temperature, conditions, such, as, the, heat, of, the, savanna, and, desert, regions, of, africa, the, ostrich, utilizes, its, respiratory, system, via, a, costal, pump, for, ventilation, rather, than, a, diaphragmatic, pump, as, seen, in, most, mammals, thus, they, are, able, to, use, a, series, of, air, sacs, connected, to, the, lungs, the, use, of, air, sacs, forms, the, basis, for, the, three, main, avian, respiratory, characteristics, inhalation, begins, at, the, mouth, and, the, nostrils, located, at, the, front, of, the, beak, the, air, then, flows, through, the, anatomical, dead, space, of, a, highly, vascular, trachea, c, 78, cm, or, 30, 1, 2, in, and, expansive, bronchial, system, where, it, is, further, conducted, to, the, posterior, air, sacs, air, flow, through, the, parabronchi, of, the, paleopulmo, is, in, the, same, direction, to, the, dorsobronchi, during, inspiration, and, expiration, inspired, air, moves, into, the, respiratory, system, as, a, result, of, the, expansion, of, thoraco, abdominal, cavity, controlled, by, inspiratory, muscles, during, expiration, oxygen, poor, air, flows, to, the, anterior, air, sacs, and, is, expelled, by, the, action, of, the, expiratory, muscles, the, common, ostrich, air, sacs, play, a, key, role, in, respiration, since, they, are, capacious, and, increase, surface, area, as, described, by, the, fick, principle, the, oxygen, rich, air, flows, unidirectionally, across, the, respiratory, surface, of, the, lungs, providing, the, blood, that, has, a, crosscurrent, flow, with, a, high, concentration, of, oxygen, to, compensate, for, the, large, dead, space, the, common, ostrich, trachea, lacks, valves, to, allow, faster, inspiratory, air, flow, in, addition, the, total, lung, capacity, of, the, respiratory, system, including, the, lungs, and, ten, air, sacs, of, a, 100, kg, 220, lb, ostrich, is, about, 15, l, 920, cu, in, with, a, tidal, volume, ranging, from, 1, 2, 1, 5, l, 75, 90, cu, in, the, tidal, volume, is, seen, to, double, resulting, in, a, 16, fold, increase, in, ventilation, overall, ostrich, respiration, can, be, thought, of, as, a, high, velocity, low, pressure, system, at, rest, there, is, a, small, pressure, difference, between, the, ostrich, air, sacs, and, the, atmosphere, suggesting, simultaneous, filling, and, emptying, of, the, air, sacs, the, increase, in, respiration, rate, from, the, low, range, to, the, high, range, is, sudden, and, occurs, in, response, to, hyperthermia, birds, lack, sweat, glands, so, when, placed, under, stress, due, to, heat, they, heavily, rely, upon, increased, evaporation, from, the, respiratory, system, for, heat, transfer, this, rise, in, respiration, rate, however, is, not, necessarily, associated, with, a, greater, rate, of, oxygen, consumption, therefore, unlike, most, other, birds, the, common, ostrich, is, able, to, dissipate, heat, through, panting, without, experiencing, respiratory, alkalosis, by, modifying, ventilation, of, the, respiratory, medium, during, hyperpnea, ostriches, pant, at, a, respiratory, rate, of, 40, 60, cycles, per, minute, versus, their, resting, rate, of, 6, 12, cycles, per, minute, hot, dry, and, moisture, lacking, properties, of, the, common, ostrich, respiratory, medium, affect, oxygen, s, diffusion, rate, henry, s, law, common, ostriches, develop, via, intussusceptive, angiogenesis, a, mechanism, of, blood, vessel, formation, characterizing, many, organs, it, is, not, only, involved, in, vasculature, expansion, but, also, in, angioadaptation, of, vessels, to, meet, physiological, requirements, the, use, of, such, mechanisms, demonstrates, an, increase, in, the, later, stages, of, lung, development, along, with, elaborate, parabronchial, vasculature, and, reorientation, of, the, gas, exchange, blood, capillaries, to, establish, the, crosscurrent, system, at, the, blood, gas, barrier, the, blood, gas, barrier, bgb, of, their, lung, tissue, is, thick, the, advantage, of, this, thick, barrier, may, be, protection, from, damage, by, large, volumes, of, blood, flow, in, times, of, activity, such, as, running, since, air, is, pumped, by, the, air, sacs, rather, than, the, lung, itself, as, a, result, the, capillaries, in, the, parabronchi, have, thinner, walls, permitting, more, efficient, gaseous, exchange, in, combination, with, separate, pulmonary, and, systemic, circulatory, systems, it, helps, to, reduce, stress, on, the, bgb, the, common, ostrich, heart, is, a, closed, system, contractile, chamber, it, is, composed, of, myogenic, muscular, tissue, associated, with, heart, contraction, features, there, is, a, double, circulatory, plan, in, place, possessing, both, a, pulmonary, circuit, and, systemic, circuit, the, common, ostrich, s, heart, has, similar, features, to, other, avian, species, like, having, a, conically, shaped, heart, and, being, enclosed, by, a, pericardium, layer, moreover, similarities, also, include, a, larger, right, atrium, volume, and, a, thicker, left, ventricle, to, fulfil, the, systemic, circuit, the, ostrich, heart, has, three, features, that, are, absent, in, related, birds, the, atrioventricular, node, position, differs, from, other, fowl, it, is, located, in, the, endocardium, of, the, atrial, surface, of, the, right, atrioventricular, valve, it, is, not, covered, by, connective, tissue, which, is, characteristic, of, vertebrate, heart, anatomy, it, also, contains, fewer, myofibrils, than, usual, myocardial, cells, the, av, node, connects, the, atrial, and, ventricular, chambers, it, functions, to, carry, the, electrical, impulse, from, the, atria, to, the, ventricle, upon, view, the, myocardial, cells, are, observed, to, have, large, densely, packed, chromosomes, within, the, nucleus, the, coronary, arteries, start, in, the, right, and, left, aortic, sinus, and, provide, blood, to, the, heart, muscle, in, a, similar, fashion, to, most, other, vertebrates, other, domestic, birds, capable, of, flight, have, three, or, more, coronary, arteries, that, supply, blood, to, the, heart, muscle, the, blood, supply, by, the, coronary, arteries, are, fashioned, starting, as, a, large, branch, over, the, surface, of, the, heart, it, then, moves, along, the, coronary, groove, and, continues, on, into, the, tissue, as, interventricular, branches, toward, the, apex, of, the, heart, the, atria, ventricles, and, septum, are, supplied, of, blood, by, this, modality, the, deep, branches, of, the, coronary, arteries, found, within, the, heart, tissue, are, small, and, supply, the, interventricular, and, right, atrioventricular, valve, with, blood, nutrients, for, which, to, carry, out, their, processes, the, interatrial, artery, of, the, ostrich, is, small, in, size, and, exclusively, supplies, blood, to, only, part, of, the, left, auricle, and, interatrial, septum, these, purkinje, fibers, p, fibers, found, in, the, hearts, moderator, bands, are, a, specialized, cardiac, muscle, fiber, that, causes, the, heart, to, contract, the, purkinje, cells, are, mostly, found, within, both, the, endocardium, and, the, sub, endocardium, the, sinoatrial, node, shows, a, small, concentration, of, purkinje, fibers, however, continuing, through, the, conducting, pathway, of, the, heart, the, bundle, of, his, shows, the, highest, amount, of, these, purkinje, fibers, the, red, blood, cell, count, per, unit, volume, in, the, ostrich, is, about, 40, of, that, of, a, human, however, the, red, blood, cells, of, the, ostrich, are, about, three, times, larger, than, the, red, blood, cells, of, a, human, the, blood, oxygen, affinity, known, as, p, 50, is, higher, than, that, of, both, humans, and, similar, avian, species, the, reason, for, this, decreased, oxygen, affinity, is, due, to, the, hemoglobin, configuration, found, in, common, ostrich, blood, the, common, ostrich, s, tetramer, is, composed, of, hemoglobin, type, a, and, d, compared, to, typical, mammalian, tetramers, composed, of, hemoglobin, type, a, and, b, hemoglobin, d, configuration, causes, a, decreased, oxygen, affinity, at, the, site, of, the, respiratory, surface, during, the, embryonic, stage, hemoglobin, e, is, present, this, subtype, increases, oxygen, affinity, in, order, to, transport, oxygen, across, the, allantoic, membrane, of, the, embryo, this, can, be, attributed, to, the, high, metabolic, need, of, the, developing, embryo, thus, high, oxygen, affinity, serves, to, satisfy, this, demand, when, the, chick, hatches, hemoglobin, e, diminishes, while, hemoglobin, a, and, d, increase, in, concentration, this, shift, in, hemoglobin, concentration, results, in, both, decreased, oxygen, affinity, and, increased, p, 50, value, furthermore, the, p, 50, value, is, influenced, by, differing, organic, modulators, in, the, typical, mammalian, rbc, 2, 3, dpg, causes, a, lower, affinity, for, oxygen, 2, 3, dpg, constitutes, approximately, 42, 47, of, the, cells, phosphate, of, the, embryonic, ostrich, however, the, adult, ostrich, have, no, traceable, 2, 3, dpg, in, place, of, 2, 3, dpg, the, ostrich, uses, inositol, polyphosphates, ipp, which, vary, from, 1, 6, phosphates, per, molecule, in, relation, to, the, ipp, the, ostrich, also, uses, atp, to, lower, oxygen, affinity, atp, has, a, consistent, concentration, of, phosphate, in, the, cell, around, 31, at, incubation, periods, and, dropping, to, 16, 20, in, 36, day, old, chicks, however, ipp, has, low, concentrations, around, 4, of, total, phosphate, concentration, in, embryonic, stages, but, the, ipp, concentration, jumps, to, 60, of, total, phosphate, of, the, cell, the, majority, of, phosphate, concentration, switches, from, 2, 3, dpg, to, ipp, suggesting, the, result, of, the, overall, low, oxygen, affinity, is, due, to, these, varying, polyphosphates, concerning, immunological, adaptation, it, was, discovered, that, wild, common, ostriches, have, a, pronounced, non, specific, immunity, defense, with, blood, content, reflecting, high, values, of, lysosome, and, phagocyte, cells, in, medium, this, is, in, contrast, to, domesticated, ostriches, who, in, captivity, develop, high, concentration, of, immunoglobulin, antibodies, in, their, circulation, indicating, an, acquired, immunological, response, it, is, suggested, that, this, immunological, adaptability, may, allow, this, species, to, have, a, high, success, rate, of, survival, in, variable, environmental, settings, the, common, ostrich, is, a, xeric, animal, due, to, the, fact, that, it, lives, in, habitats, that, are, both, dry, and, hot, water, is, scarce, in, dry, and, hot, environments, and, this, poses, a, challenge, to, the, ostrich, s, water, consumption, also, the, ostrich, is, a, ground, bird, and, cannot, fly, to, find, water, sources, which, poses, a, further, challenge, because, of, their, size, common, ostriches, cannot, easily, escape, the, heat, of, their, environment, however, they, dehydrate, less, than, their, small, bird, counterparts, because, of, their, small, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, hot, arid, habitats, pose, osmotic, stress, such, as, dehydration, which, triggers, the, common, ostrich, s, homeostatic, response, to, osmoregulate, the, common, ostrich, is, well, adapted, to, hot, arid, environments, through, specialization, of, excretory, organs, the, common, ostrich, has, an, extremely, long, and, developed, colon, a, length, of, approximately, 11, 13, m, 36, 43, ft, between, the, coprodeum, and, the, paired, caeca, which, are, around, 80, cm, 30, in, long, a, well, developed, caeca, is, also, found, and, in, combination, with, the, rectum, forms, the, microbial, fermentation, chambers, used, for, carbohydrate, breakdown, the, catabolism, of, carbohydrates, produces, around, 0, 56, grams, 9, grains, of, water, that, can, be, used, internally, the, majority, of, their, urine, is, stored, in, the, coprodeum, and, the, feces, are, separately, stored, in, the, terminal, colon, the, coprodeum, is, located, ventral, to, the, terminal, rectum, and, urodeum, where, the, ureters, open, found, between, the, terminal, rectum, and, coprodeum, is, a, strong, sphincter, the, coprodeum, and, cloaca, are, the, main, osmoregulatory, mechanisms, used, for, the, regulation, and, reabsorption, of, ions, and, water, or, net, water, conservation, as, expected, in, a, species, inhabiting, arid, regions, dehydration, causes, a, reduction, in, fecal, water, or, dry, feces, this, reduction, is, believed, to, be, caused, by, high, levels, of, plasma, aldosterone, which, leads, to, rectal, absorption, of, sodium, and, water, also, expected, is, the, production, of, hyperosmotic, urine, cloacal, urine, has, been, found, to, be, 800, mosm, the, u, p, urine, plasma, ratio, of, the, common, ostrich, is, therefore, greater, than, one, diffusion, of, water, to, the, coprodeum, where, urine, is, stored, from, plasma, across, the, epithelium, is, voided, this, void, is, believed, to, be, caused, by, the, thick, mucosal, layering, of, the, coprodeum, common, ostriches, have, two, kidneys, which, are, chocolate, brown, in, color, are, granular, in, texture, and, lie, in, a, depression, in, the, pelvic, cavity, of, the, dorsal, wall, they, are, covered, by, peritoneum, and, a, layer, of, fat, each, kidney, is, about, 300, mm, 12, in, long, 70, mm, 3, in, wide, and, divided, into, a, cranial, middle, and, caudal, sections, by, large, veins, the, caudal, section, is, the, largest, extending, into, the, middle, of, the, pelvis, the, ureters, leave, the, ventral, caudomedial, surface, and, continue, caudally, near, the, midline, into, the, opening, of, the, urodeum, of, the, cloaca, although, there, is, no, bladder, a, dilated, pouch, of, ureter, stores, the, urine, until, it, is, secreted, continuously, down, from, the, ureters, to, the, urodeum, until, discharged, common, ostrich, kidneys, are, fairly, large, and, so, are, able, to, hold, significant, amounts, of, solutes, hence, common, ostriches, drink, relatively, large, volumes, of, water, daily, and, excrete, generous, quantities, of, highly, concentrated, urine, it, is, when, drinking, water, is, unavailable, or, withdrawn, that, the, urine, becomes, highly, concentrated, with, uric, acid, and, urates, it, seems, that, common, ostriches, who, normally, drink, relatively, large, amounts, of, water, tend, to, rely, on, renal, conservation, of, water, within, the, kidney, system, when, drinking, water, is, scarce, though, there, have, been, no, official, detailed, renal, studies, conducted, on, the, flow, rate, poiseuille, s, law, and, composition, of, the, ureteral, urine, in, the, ostrich, knowledge, of, renal, function, has, been, based, on, samples, of, cloacal, urine, and, samples, or, quantitative, collections, of, voided, urine, studies, have, shown, that, the, amount, of, water, intake, and, dehydration, impacts, the, plasma, osmolality, and, urine, osmolality, within, various, sized, ostriches, during, a, normal, hydration, state, of, the, kidneys, young, ostriches, tend, to, have, a, measured, plasma, osmolality, of, 284, mosm, and, urine, osmolality, of, 62, mosm, adults, have, higher, rates, with, a, plasma, osmolality, of, 330, mosm, and, urine, osmolality, of, 163, mosm, the, osmolality, of, both, plasma, and, urine, can, alter, in, regards, to, whether, there, is, an, excess, or, depleted, amount, of, water, present, within, the, kidneys, an, interesting, fact, of, common, ostriches, is, that, when, water, is, freely, available, the, urine, osmolality, can, reduce, to, 60, 70, mosm, not, losing, any, necessary, solutes, from, the, kidneys, when, excess, water, is, excreted, dehydrated, or, salt, loaded, ostriches, can, reach, a, maximal, urine, osmolality, of, approximately, 800, mosm, when, the, plasma, osmolality, has, been, measured, simultaneously, with, the, maximal, osmotic, urine, it, is, seen, that, the, urine, plasma, ratio, is, 2, 6, 1, the, highest, encountered, among, avian, species, along, with, dehydration, there, is, also, a, reduction, in, flow, rate, from, 20, l, d, 1, to, only, 0, 3, 0, 5, l, d, 1, in, mammals, and, common, ostriches, the, increase, of, the, glomerular, filtration, rate, gfr, and, urine, flow, rate, ufr, is, due, to, a, high, protein, diets, as, seen, in, various, studies, scientists, have, measured, clearance, of, creatinine, a, fairly, reliable, marker, of, glomerular, filtration, rate, gfr, it, has, been, seen, that, during, normal, hydration, within, the, kidneys, the, glomerular, filtration, rate, is, approximately, 92, ml, min, however, when, an, ostrich, experiences, dehydration, for, at, least, 48, hours, 2, days, this, value, diminishes, to, only, 25, of, the, hydrated, gfr, rate, thus, in, response, to, the, dehydration, ostrich, kidneys, secrete, small, amounts, of, very, viscous, glomerular, filtrates, that, have, not, been, broken, down, and, return, them, to, the, circulatory, system, through, blood, vessels, the, reduction, of, gfr, during, dehydration, is, extremely, high, and, so, the, fractional, excretion, of, water, urine, flow, rate, as, a, percentage, of, gfr, drops, down, from, 15, at, normal, hydration, to, 1, during, dehydration, common, ostriches, employ, adaptive, features, to, manage, the, dry, heat, and, solar, radiation, in, their, habitat, ostriches, will, drink, available, water, however, they, are, limited, in, accessing, water, by, being, flightless, they, are, also, able, to, harvest, water, through, dietary, means, consuming, plants, such, as, the, euphorbia, heterochroma, that, hold, up, to, 87, water, water, mass, accounts, for, 68, of, body, mass, in, adult, common, ostriches, this, is, down, from, 84, water, mass, in, 35, day, old, chicks, the, differing, degrees, of, water, retention, are, thought, to, be, a, result, of, varying, body, fat, mass, in, comparison, to, smaller, birds, ostriches, have, a, lower, evaporative, water, loss, resulting, from, their, small, body, surface, area, per, unit, weight, when, heat, stress, is, at, its, maximum, common, ostriches, are, able, to, recover, evaporative, loss, by, using, a, metabolic, water, mechanism, to, counter, the, loss, by, urine, feces, and, respiratory, evaporation, an, experiment, to, determine, the, primary, source, of, water, intake, in, the, ostrich, indicated, that, while, the, ostrich, does, employ, a, metabolic, water, production, mechanism, as, a, source, of, hydration, the, most, important, source, of, water, is, food, when, ostriches, were, restricted, to, the, no, food, or, water, condition, the, metabolic, water, production, was, only, 0, 5, l, d, 1, while, total, water, lost, to, urine, feces, and, evaporation, was, 2, 3, l, d, 1, when, the, birds, were, given, both, water, and, food, total, water, gain, was, 8, 5, l, d, 1, in, the, food, only, condition, total, water, gain, was, 10, 1, l, d, 1, these, results, show, that, the, metabolic, water, mechanism, is, not, able, to, sustain, water, loss, independently, and, that, food, intake, specifically, of, plants, with, a, high, water, content, such, as, euphorbia, heterochroma, is, necessary, to, overcome, water, loss, challenges, in, the, common, ostrich, s, arid, habitat, in, times, of, water, deprivation, urine, electrolyte, and, osmotic, concentration, increases, while, urination, rate, decreases, under, these, conditions, urine, solute, plasma, ratio, is, approximately, 2, 5, or, hyperosmotic, that, is, to, say, that, the, ratio, of, solutes, to, water, in, the, plasma, is, shifted, down, whereby, reducing, osmotic, pressure, in, the, plasma, water, is, then, able, to, be, held, back, from, excretion, keeping, the, ostrich, hydrated, while, the, passed, urine, contains, higher, concentrations, of, solute, this, mechanism, exemplifies, how, renal, function, facilitates, water, retention, during, periods, of, dehydration, stress, a, number, of, avian, species, use, nasal, salt, glands, alongside, their, kidneys, to, control, hypertonicity, in, their, blood, plasma, however, the, common, ostrich, shows, no, nasal, glandular, function, in, regard, to, this, homeostatic, process, even, in, a, state, of, dehydration, which, increases, the, osmolality, of, the, blood, nasal, salt, glands, show, no, sizeable, contribution, of, salt, elimination, also, the, overall, mass, of, the, glands, was, less, than, that, of, the, duck, s, nasal, gland, the, common, ostrich, having, a, heavier, body, weight, should, have, larger, heavier, nasal, glands, to, more, effectively, excrete, salt, from, a, larger, volume, of, blood, but, this, is, not, the, case, these, unequal, proportions, contribute, to, the, assumption, that, the, common, ostrich, s, nasal, glands, do, not, play, any, role, in, salt, excretion, the, majority, of, the, common, ostrich, s, internal, solutes, are, made, up, of, sodium, ions, na, potassium, ions, k, chloride, ions, cl, total, short, chain, fatty, acids, scfa, and, acetate, the, caecum, contains, a, high, water, concentration, with, reduced, levels, nearing, the, terminal, colon, and, exhibits, a, rapid, fall, in, na, concentrations, and, small, changes, in, k, and, cl, the, colon, is, divided, into, three, sections, and, takes, part, in, solute, absorption, the, upper, colon, largely, absorbs, na, and, scfa, and, partially, absorbs, kcl, the, middle, colon, absorbs, na, and, scfa, with, little, net, transfer, of, k, and, cl, the, lower, colon, then, slightly, absorbs, na, and, water, and, secretes, k, there, is, no, net, movements, of, cl, and, scfa, found, in, the, lower, colon, when, the, common, ostrich, is, in, a, dehydrated, state, plasma, osmolality, na, k, and, cl, ions, all, increase, however, k, ions, return, to, controlled, concentration, the, common, ostrich, also, experiences, an, increase, in, haematocrit, resulting, in, a, hypovolemic, state, two, antidiuretic, hormones, arginine, vasotocin, avt, and, angiotensin, aii, are, increased, in, blood, plasma, as, a, response, to, hyperosmolality, and, hypovolemia, avt, triggers, antidiuretic, hormone, adh, which, targets, the, nephrons, of, the, kidney, adh, causes, a, reabsorption, of, water, from, the, lumen, of, the, nephron, to, the, extracellular, fluid, osmotically, these, extracellular, fluids, then, drain, into, blood, vessels, causing, a, rehydrating, effect, this, drainage, prevents, loss, of, water, by, both, lowering, volume, and, increasing, concentration, of, the, urine, angiotensin, on, the, other, hand, causes, vasoconstriction, on, the, systemic, arterioles, and, acts, as, a, dipsogen, for, ostriches, both, of, these, antidiuretic, hormones, work, together, to, maintain, water, levels, in, the, body, that, would, normally, be, lost, due, to, the, osmotic, stress, of, the, arid, environment, ostriches, are, uricotelic, excreting, nitrogen, in, the, form, of, uric, acid, and, related, derivatives, uric, acid, s, low, solubility, in, water, gives, a, semi, solid, paste, consistency, to, the, ostrich, s, nitrogenous, waste, common, ostriches, are, homeothermic, endotherms, they, regulate, a, constant, body, temperature, via, regulating, their, metabolic, heat, rate, they, closely, regulate, their, core, body, temperature, but, their, appendages, may, be, cooler, in, comparison, as, found, with, regulating, species, the, temperature, of, their, beak, neck, surfaces, lower, legs, feet, and, toes, are, regulated, through, heat, exchange, with, the, environment, up, to, 40, of, their, produced, metabolic, heat, is, dissipated, across, these, structures, which, account, for, about, 12, of, their, total, surface, area, total, evaporative, water, loss, tewl, is, statistically, lower, in, the, common, ostrich, than, in, membering, ratites, as, ambient, temperature, increases, dry, heat, loss, decreases, but, evaporative, heat, loss, increases, because, of, increased, respiration, as, ostriches, experience, high, ambient, temperatures, circa, 50, c, 120, f, they, become, slightly, hyperthermic, however, they, can, maintain, a, stable, body, temperature, around, 40, c, 105, f, for, up, to, 8, hours, in, these, conditions, when, dehydrated, the, common, ostrich, minimizes, water, loss, causing, the, body, temperature, to, increase, further, when, the, body, heat, is, allowed, to, increase, the, temperature, gradient, between, the, common, ostrich, and, ambient, heat, is, equilibrated, common, ostriches, have, developed, a, comprehensive, set, of, behavioral, adaptations, for, thermoregulation, such, as, altering, their, feathers, common, ostriches, display, a, feather, fluffing, behavior, that, aids, them, in, thermoregulation, by, regulating, convective, heat, loss, at, high, ambient, temperatures, they, may, also, physically, seek, out, shade, in, times, of, high, ambient, temperatures, when, feather, fluffing, they, contract, their, muscles, to, raise, their, feathers, to, increase, the, air, space, next, to, their, skin, this, air, space, provides, an, insulating, thickness, of, 7, cm, 3, in, the, ostrich, will, also, expose, the, thermal, windows, of, their, unfeathered, skin, to, enhance, convective, and, radiative, loss, in, times, of, heat, stress, at, higher, ambient, temperatures, lower, appendage, temperature, increases, to, 5, c, 9, 0, f, difference, from, ambient, temperature, neck, surfaces, are, around, 6, 7, c, 11, 13, f, difference, at, most, ambient, temperatures, except, when, temperatures, are, around, 25, c, 77, f, it, was, only, 4, c, 7, f, above, ambient, at, low, ambient, temperatures, the, common, ostrich, utilizes, feather, flattening, which, conserves, body, heat, through, insulation, the, low, conductance, coefficient, of, air, allows, less, heat, to, be, lost, to, the, environment, this, flattening, behavior, compensate, for, common, ostrich, s, rather, poor, cutaneous, evaporative, water, loss, cewl, these, feather, heavy, areas, such, as, the, body, thighs, and, wings, do, not, usually, vary, much, from, ambient, temperatures, due, to, this, behavioural, controls, this, ostrich, will, also, cover, its, legs, to, reduce, heat, loss, to, the, environment, along, with, undergoing, piloerection, and, shivering, when, faced, with, low, ambient, temperatures, the, use, of, countercurrent, heat, exchange, with, blood, flow, allows, for, regulated, conservation, elimination, of, heat, of, appendages, when, ambient, temperatures, are, low, heterotherms, will, constrict, their, arterioles, to, reduce, heat, loss, along, skin, surfaces, the, reverse, occurs, at, high, ambient, temperatures, arterioles, dilate, to, increase, heat, loss, at, ambient, temperatures, below, their, body, temperatures, thermal, neutral, zone, tnz, common, ostriches, decrease, body, surface, temperatures, so, that, heat, loss, occurs, only, across, about, 10, of, total, surface, area, this, 10, include, critical, areas, that, require, blood, flow, to, remain, high, to, prevent, freezing, such, as, their, eyes, their, eyes, and, ears, tend, to, be, the, warmest, regions, it, has, been, found, that, temperatures, of, lower, appendages, were, no, more, than, 2, 5, c, 4, 5, f, above, ambient, temperature, which, minimizes, heat, exchange, between, feet, toes, wings, and, legs, both, the, gular, and, air, sacs, being, close, to, body, temperature, are, the, main, contributors, to, heat, and, water, loss, surface, temperature, can, be, affected, by, the, rate, of, blood, flow, to, a, certain, area, and, also, by, the, surface, area, of, the, surrounding, tissue, the, ostrich, reduces, blood, flow, to, the, trachea, to, cool, itself, and, vasodilates, to, its, blood, vessels, around, the, gular, region, to, raise, the, temperature, of, the, tissue, the, air, sacs, are, poorly, vascularized, but, show, an, increased, temperature, which, aids, in, heat, loss, common, ostriches, have, evolved, a, selective, brain, cooling, mechanism, as, a, means, of, thermoregulation, this, modality, allows, the, common, ostrich, to, manage, the, temperature, of, the, blood, going, to, the, brain, in, response, to, the, extreme, ambient, temperature, of, the, surroundings, the, morphology, for, heat, exchange, occurs, via, cerebral, arteries, and, the, ophthalmic, rete, a, network, of, arteries, originating, from, the, ophthalmic, artery, the, ophthalmic, rete, is, analogous, to, the, carotid, rete, found, in, mammals, as, it, also, facilitates, transfer, of, heat, from, arterial, blood, coming, from, the, core, to, venous, blood, returning, from, the, evaporative, surfaces, at, the, head, researchers, suggest, that, common, ostriches, also, employ, a, selective, brain, warming, mechanism, in, response, to, cooler, surrounding, temperatures, in, the, evenings, the, brain, was, found, to, maintain, a, warmer, temperature, when, compared, to, carotid, arterial, blood, supply, researchers, hypothesize, three, mechanisms, that, could, explain, this, finding, further, research, will, need, to, be, done, to, find, how, this, occurs, the, common, ostrich, has, no, sweat, glands, and, under, heat, stress, they, rely, on, panting, to, reduce, their, body, temperature, panting, increases, evaporative, heat, and, water, loss, from, its, respiratory, surfaces, therefore, forcing, air, and, heat, removal, without, the, loss, of, metabolic, salts, panting, allows, the, common, ostrich, to, have, a, very, effective, respiratory, evaporative, water, loss, rewl, heat, dissipated, by, respiratory, evaporation, increases, linearly, with, ambient, temperature, matching, the, rate, of, heat, production, as, a, result, of, panting, the, common, ostrich, should, eventually, experience, alkalosis, however, the, co, 2, concentration, in, the, blood, does, not, change, when, hot, ambient, temperatures, are, experienced, this, effect, is, caused, by, a, lung, surface, shunt, the, lung, is, not, completely, shunted, allowing, enough, oxygen, to, fulfill, the, bird, s, metabolic, needs, the, common, ostrich, utilizes, gular, fluttering, rapid, rhythmic, contraction, and, relaxation, of, throat, muscles, in, a, similar, way, to, panting, both, these, behaviors, allow, the, ostrich, to, actively, increase, the, rate, of, evaporative, cooling, in, hot, temperatures, water, is, lost, via, respiration, moreover, varying, surface, temperatures, within, the, respiratory, tract, contribute, differently, to, overall, heat, and, water, loss, through, panting, the, surface, temperature, of, the, gular, area, is, 38, c, 100, f, that, of, the, tracheal, area, is, between, 34, and, 36, c, 93, and, 97, f, and, that, of, both, anterior, and, posterior, air, sacs, is, 38, c, 100, f, the, long, trachea, being, cooler, than, body, temperature, is, a, site, of, water, evaporation, as, ambient, air, becomes, hotter, additional, evaporation, can, take, place, lower, in, the, trachea, making, its, way, to, the, posterior, sacs, shunting, the, lung, surface, the, trachea, acts, as, a, buffer, for, evaporation, because, of, the, length, and, the, controlled, vascularization, the, gular, is, also, heavily, vascularized, its, purpose, is, for, cooling, blood, but, also, evaporation, as, previously, stated, air, flowing, through, the, trachea, can, be, either, laminar, or, turbulent, depending, on, the, state, of, the, bird, when, the, common, ostrich, is, breathing, normally, under, no, heat, stress, air, flow, is, laminar, when, the, common, ostrich, is, experiencing, heat, stress, from, the, environment, the, air, flow, is, considered, turbulent, this, suggests, that, laminar, air, flow, causes, little, to, no, heat, transfer, while, under, heat, stress, turbulent, airflow, can, cause, maximum, heat, transfer, within, the, trachea, common, ostriches, are, able, to, attain, their, necessary, energetic, requirements, via, the, oxidation, of, absorbed, nutrients, much, of, the, metabolic, rate, in, animals, is, dependent, upon, their, allometry, the, relationship, between, body, size, to, shape, anatomy, physiology, and, behavior, of, an, animal, hence, it, is, plausible, to, state, that, metabolic, rate, in, animals, with, larger, masses, is, greater, than, animals, with, a, smaller, mass, when, a, bird, is, inactive, and, unfed, and, the, ambient, temperature, i, e, in, the, thermo, neutral, zone, is, high, the, energy, expended, is, at, its, minimum, this, level, of, expenditure, is, better, known, as, the, basal, metabolic, rate, bmr, and, can, be, calculated, by, measuring, the, amount, of, oxygen, consumed, during, various, activities, therefore, in, common, ostriches, we, see, use, of, more, energy, when, compared, to, smaller, birds, in, absolute, terms, but, less, per, unit, mass, a, key, point, when, looking, at, the, common, ostrich, metabolism, is, to, note, that, it, is, a, non, passerine, bird, thus, bmr, in, ostriches, is, particularly, low, with, a, value, of, only, 0, 113, ml, o, 2, g, 1, h, 1, this, value, can, further, be, described, using, kleiber, s, law, which, relates, the, bmr, to, the, body, mass, of, an, animal, where, m, is, body, mass, and, metabolic, rate, is, measured, in, kcal, per, day, in, common, ostriches, a, bmr, ml, o, 2, g, 1, h, 1, 389, kg, 0, 73, describing, a, line, parallel, to, the, intercept, with, only, about, 60, in, relation, to, other, non, passerine, birds, along, with, bmr, energy, is, also, needed, for, a, range, of, other, activities, if, the, ambient, temperature, is, lower, than, the, thermo, neutral, zone, heat, is, produced, to, maintain, body, temperature, so, the, metabolic, rate, in, a, resting, unfed, bird, that, is, producing, heat, is, known, as, the, standard, metabolic, rate, smr, or, resting, metabolic, rate, rmr, the, common, ostrich, smr, has, been, seen, to, be, approximately, 0, 26, ml, o, 2, g, 1, h, 1, almost, 2, 3, times, the, bmr, on, another, note, animals, that, engage, in, extensive, physical, activity, employ, substantial, amounts, of, energy, for, power, this, is, known, as, the, maximum, metabolic, scope, in, an, ostrich, it, is, seen, to, be, at, least, 28, times, greater, than, the, bmr, likewise, the, daily, energy, turnover, rate, for, an, ostrich, with, access, to, free, water, is, 12, 700, kj, d, 1, equivalent, to, 0, 26, ml, o, 2, g, 1, h, 1, the, wild, common, ostrich, population, has, declined, drastically, in, the, last, 200, years, with, most, surviving, birds, in, reserves, or, on, farms, however, its, range, remains, very, large, 9, 800, 000, km, 2, or, 3, 800, 000, sq, mi, leading, the, iucn, and, birdlife, international, to, treat, it, as, a, species, of, least, concern, of, its, five, subspecies, the, arabian, ostrich, s, c, syriacus, became, extinct, around, 1966, north, african, ostrich, populations, are, protected, under, appendix, i, of, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, cites, meaning, commercial, international, trade, is, prohibited, and, non, commercial, trade, is, strictly, regulated, common, ostriches, have, inspired, cultures, and, civilizations, for, 5, 000, years, in, mesopotamia, and, african, centres, like, egypt, and, the, kingdom, of, kush, a, statue, of, arsinoe, ii, of, egypt, riding, a, common, ostrich, was, found, in, a, tomb, in, egypt, hunter, gatherers, in, the, kalahari, use, ostrich, eggshells, as, water, containers, punching, a, hole, in, them, they, also, produce, jewelry, from, it, the, presence, of, such, eggshells, with, engraved, hatched, symbols, dating, from, the, howiesons, poort, period, of, the, middle, stone, age, at, diepkloof, rock, shelter, in, south, africa, suggests, common, ostriches, were, an, important, part, of, human, life, as, early, as, 60, 000, bp, in, eastern, christianity, it, is, common, to, hang, decorated, common, ostrich, eggs, on, the, chains, holding, the, oil, lamps, the, initial, reason, was, probably, to, prevent, mice, and, rats, from, climbing, down, the, chain, to, eat, the, oil, another, symbolical, explanation, is, based, in, the, fictitious, tradition, that, female, common, ostriches, do, not, sit, on, their, eggs, but, stare, at, them, incessantly, until, they, hatch, out, because, if, they, stop, staring, even, for, a, second, the, egg, will, addle, this, is, equated, to, the, obligation, of, the, christian, to, direct, his, entire, attention, towards, god, during, prayer, lest, the, prayer, be, fruitless, contrary, to, popular, belief, ostriches, do, not, bury, their, heads, in, sand, to, avoid, danger, this, myth, likely, began, with, pliny, the, elder, 23, 79, ce, who, wrote, that, ostriches, imagine, when, they, have, thrust, their, head, and, neck, into, a, bush, that, the, whole, of, their, body, is, concealed, this, may, have, been, a, misunderstanding, of, their, sticking, their, heads, in, the, sand, to, swallow, sand, and, pebbles, to, help, digest, their, fibrous, food, or, as, national, geographic, suggests, of, the, defensive, behavior, of, lying, low, so, that, they, may, appear, from, a, distance, to, have, their, head, buried, another, possible, origin, for, the, myth, lies, with, the, fact, that, ostriches, keep, their, eggs, in, holes, in, the, sand, instead, of, nests, and, must, rotate, them, using, their, beaks, during, incubation, digging, the, hole, placing, the, eggs, and, rotating, them, might, each, be, mistaken, for, an, attempt, to, bury, their, heads, in, the, sand, in, roman, times, there, was, a, demand, for, common, ostriches, to, use, in, venatio, games, or, cooking, they, have, been, hunted, and, farmed, for, their, feathers, which, at, various, times, have, been, popular, for, ornamentation, in, fashionable, clothing, such, as, hats, during, the, 19th, century, their, skins, are, valued, for, their, leather, in, the, 18th, century, they, were, almost, hunted, to, extinction, farming, for, feathers, began, in, the, 19th, century, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, there, were, over, 700, 000, birds, in, captivity, the, market, for, feathers, collapsed, after, world, war, i, but, commercial, farming, for, feathers, and, later, for, skins, and, meat, became, widespread, during, the, 1970s, common, ostriches, have, been, farmed, in, south, africa, since, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, according, to, frank, g, carpenter, the, english, are, credited, with, first, taming, common, ostriches, outside, cape, town, farmers, captured, baby, common, ostriches, and, raised, them, successfully, on, their, property, and, they, were, able, to, obtain, a, crop, of, feathers, every, seven, to, eight, months, instead, of, killing, wild, common, ostriches, for, their, feathers, feathers, are, still, commercially, harvested, it, is, claimed, that, common, ostriches, produce, the, strongest, commercial, leather, common, ostrich, meat, tastes, similar, to, lean, beef, and, is, low, in, fat, and, cholesterol, as, well, as, high, in, calcium, protein, and, iron, it, is, considered, to, be, both, poultry, and, red, meat, uncooked, it, is, dark, red, or, cherry, red, a, little, darker, than, beef, ostrich, stew, is, a, dish, prepared, using, common, ostrich, meat, some, common, ostrich, farms, also, cater, to, agri, tourism, which, may, produce, a, substantial, portion, of, the, farm, s, income, this, may, include, tours, of, the, farmlands, souvenirs, or, even, ostrich, rides, common, ostriches, typically, avoid, humans, in, the, wild, since, they, correctly, assess, humans, as, potential, predators, if, approached, they, often, run, away, but, sometimes, ostriches, can, be, very, aggressive, when, threatened, especially, if, cornered, and, may, also, attack, if, they, feel, the, need, to, defend, their, territories, or, offspring, similar, behaviors, are, noted, in, captive, or, domesticated, common, ostriches, which, retain, the, same, natural, instincts, and, can, occasionally, respond, aggressively, to, stress, when, attacking, a, person, common, ostriches, deliver, slashing, kicks, with, their, powerful, feet, armed, with, long, claws, with, which, they, can, disembowel, or, kill, a, person, with, a, single, blow, in, one, study, of, common, ostrich, attacks, it, was, estimated, that, two, to, three, attacks, that, result, in, serious, injury, or, death, occur, each, year, in, the, area, of, oudtshoorn, south, africa, where, a, large, number, of, common, ostrich, farms, are, set, next, to, both, feral, and, wild, common, ostrich, populations, making, them, statistically, the, world, s, most, dangerous, bird, in, some, countries, people, race, each, other, on, the, backs, of, common, ostriches, the, practice, is, common, in, africa, and, is, relatively, unusual, elsewhere, the, common, ostriches, are, ridden, in, the, same, way, as, horses, with, special, saddles, reins, and, bits, however, they, are, harder, to, manage, than, horses, the, practice, is, becoming, less, common, due, to, ethical, concerns, and, nowadays, ostrich, farms, set, a, limit, weight, for, people, to, ride, ostriches, making, the, activity, mostly, suited, for, children, and, smaller, adults, the, racing, is, also, a, part, of, modern, south, african, culture, within, the, united, states, a, tourist, attraction, in, jacksonville, florida, called, the, ostrich, farm, opened, up, in, 1892, it, and, its, races, became, one, of, the, most, famous, early, attractions, in, the, history, of, florida, likewise, the, arts, scene, in, indio, california, consists, of, both, ostrich, and, camel, racing, chandler, arizona, hosts, the, annual, ostrich, festival, which, features, common, ostrich, races, racing, has, also, occurred, at, many, other, locations, such, as, virginia, city, in, nevada, canterbury, park, in, minnesota, prairie, meadows, in, iowa, ellis, park, in, kentucky, and, the, fairgrounds, in, new, orleans, louisiana
