agkistrodon, piscivorus, is, a, species, of, venomous, snake, a, pit, viper, in, the, subfamily, crotalinae, of, the, family, viperidae, it, is, one, of, the, world, s, few, semiaquatic, vipers, along, with, the, florida, cottonmouth, and, is, native, to, the, southeastern, united, states, as, an, adult, it, is, large, and, capable, of, delivering, a, painful, and, potentially, fatal, bite, when, threatened, it, may, respond, by, coiling, its, body, and, displaying, its, fangs, individuals, may, bite, when, feeling, threatened, or, being, handled, in, any, way, it, tends, to, be, found, in, or, near, water, particularly, in, slow, moving, and, shallow, lakes, streams, and, marshes, it, is, a, capable, swimmer, and, like, several, species, of, snakes, is, known, to, occasionally, enter, bays, and, estuaries, and, swim, between, barrier, islands, and, the, mainland, 211, p, the, generic, name, is, derived, from, the, greek, words, agkistron, fish, hook, hook, and, odon, tooth, and, the, specific, name, comes, from, the, latin, piscis, fish, and, voro, i, eat, greedily, devour, thus, the, scientific, name, translates, to, hook, toothed, fish, eater, common, names, include, cottonmouth, northern, cottonmouth, water, moccasin, swamp, moccasin, black, moccasin, and, simply, viper, many, of, the, common, names, refer, to, the, threat, display, in, which, this, species, often, stands, its, ground, and, gapes, at, an, intruder, exposing, the, white, lining, of, its, mouth, many, scientists, dislike, the, use, of, the, term, water, moccasin, since, it, can, lead, to, confusion, between, the, venomous, cottonmouth, and, nonvenomous, water, snakes, this, is, a, list, of, common, names, for, a, piscivorus, some, of, which, also, refer, to, other, species, for, many, decades, one, species, with, three, subspecies, were, formally, recognized, eastern, cottonmouth, a, p, piscivorus, lac, p, de, 1789, western, cottonmouth, a, p, leucostoma, troost, 1836, and, florida, cottonmouth, a, p, conanti, gloyd, 1969, however, a, molecular, dna, based, study, was, published, in, 2014, applying, phylogenetic, theories, one, implication, being, no, subspecies, are, recognized, changing, the, long, standing, taxonomy, the, resulting, and, current, taxonomic, arrangement, recognizes, two, species, and, no, subspecies, the, western, cottonmouth, a, p, leucostoma, was, synonymized, with, the, eastern, cottonmouth, a, p, piscivorus, into, one, species, with, the, oldest, published, name, a, p, piscivorus, having, priority, the, florida, cottonmouth, a, p, conanti, is, now, recognized, as, a, separate, species, agkistrodon, piscivorus, piscivorus, lac, p, de, 1789, agkistrodon, piscivorus, lac, p, de, 1789, agkistrodon, piscivorus, leucostoma, troost, 1836, agkistrodon, piscivorus, lac, p, de, 1789, agkistrodon, piscivorus, conanti, gloyd, 1969, agkistrodon, conanti, gloyd, 1969, agkistrodon, piscivorus, is, the, largest, species, of, the, genus, agkistrodon, adults, commonly, exceed, 80, cm, 31, in, in, total, length, including, tail, females, are, typically, smaller, than, males, total, length, per, one, study, of, adults, was, 65, to, 90, cm, 26, to, 35, in, average, body, mass, has, been, found, to, be, 292, 5, to, 579, 6, g, 10, 32, to, 20, 44, oz, in, males, and, 201, 1, to, 254, 1, g, 7, 09, to, 8, 96, oz, in, females, occasionally, individuals, may, exceed, 180, cm, 71, in, in, total, length, especially, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, range, although, larger, ones, have, purportedly, been, seen, in, the, wild, according, to, gloyd, and, conant, 1990, the, largest, recorded, specimen, of, a, p, piscivorus, was, 188, cm, 74, in, in, total, length, based, on, a, specimen, caught, in, the, dismal, swamp, region, and, given, to, the, philadelphia, zoological, garden, this, snake, had, apparently, been, injured, during, capture, died, several, days, later, and, was, measured, when, straight, and, relaxed, large, specimens, can, be, extremely, bulky, with, the, mass, of, a, specimen, of, about, 180, cm, 71, in, in, total, length, known, to, weigh, 4, 6, kg, 10, lb, interestingly, many, would, assume, that, the, morphology, of, an, aquatic, snake, should, have, a, small, narrow, head, that, tapers, towards, the, back, to, minimize, drag, in, the, water, especially, when, capturing, prey, however, the, pit, vipers, and, particularly, cottonmouths, display, a, contradicting, structure, with, its, bulky, triangular, head, which, would, be, assumed, to, be, poorly, suited, to, water, yet, it, is, not, the, case, the, broad, head, is, distinct, from, the, neck, and, the, snout, is, blunt, in, profile, with, the, rim, of, the, top, of, the, head, extending, forwards, slightly, further, than, the, mouth, substantial, cranial, plates, are, present, although, the, parietal, plates, are, often, fragmented, especially, towards, the, rear, a, loreal, scale, is, absent, six, to, 9, supralabials, and, eight, to, 12, infralabials, are, seen, at, midbody, it, has, 23, 27, rows, of, dorsal, scales, all, dorsal, scale, rows, have, keels, although, those, on, the, lowermost, scale, rows, are, weak, in, males, females, the, ventral, scales, number, 130, 145, 128, 144, and, the, subcaudals, 38, 54, 36, 50, many, of, the, latter, may, be, divided, though, most, specimens, are, almost, or, even, totally, black, with, the, exception, of, the, head, and, facial, markings, the, color, pattern, may, consist, of, a, brown, gray, tan, yellowish, olive, or, blackish, ground, color, which, is, overlaid, with, a, series, of, 10, 17, dark, brown, to, almost, black, crossbands, these, crossbands, which, usually, have, black, edges, are, sometimes, broken, along, the, dorsal, midline, to, form, a, series, of, staggered, halfbands, on, either, side, of, the, body, these, crossbands, are, visibly, lighter, in, the, center, almost, matching, the, ground, color, often, contain, irregular, dark, markings, and, extend, well, down, onto, the, ventral, scales, the, dorsal, banding, pattern, fades, with, age, so, older, individuals, are, an, almost, uniform, olive, brown, grayish, brown, or, black, the, belly, is, white, yellowish, white, or, tan, marked, with, dark, spots, and, becomes, darker, posteriorly, the, amount, of, dark, pigment, on, the, belly, varies, from, virtually, none, to, almost, completely, black, the, head, is, a, more, or, less, uniform, brown, color, especially, in, a, p, piscivorus, subadult, specimens, may, exhibit, the, same, kind, of, dark, parietal, spots, characteristic, of, a, contortrix, but, sometimes, these, are, still, visible, in, adults, eastern, populations, have, a, broad, dark, postocular, stripe, bordered, with, pale, pigment, above, and, below, that, is, faint, or, absent, in, western, populations, the, underside, of, the, head, is, generally, whitish, cream, or, tan, juvenile, and, subadult, specimens, generally, have, a, more, contrasting, color, pattern, with, dark, crossbands, on, a, lighter, ground, color, the, ground, color, is, then, tan, brown, or, reddish, brown, the, tip, of, the, tail, is, usually, yellowish, becoming, greenish, yellow, or, greenish, in, subadults, and, then, black, in, adults, on, some, juveniles, the, banding, pattern, can, also, be, seen, on, the, tail, young, snakes, wiggle, the, tips, of, their, tails, to, lure, prey, animals, this, species, is, often, confused, with, the, copperhead, a, contortrix, this, is, especially, true, for, juveniles, but, differences, exist, a, piscivorus, has, broad, dark, stripes, on, the, sides, of, its, head, that, extend, back, from, the, eyes, whereas, a, contortrix, has, only, a, thin, dark, line, that, divides, the, pale, supralabials, from, the, somewhat, darker, color, of, the, head, the, watersnakes, of, the, genus, nerodia, are, also, similar, in, appearance, being, thick, bodied, with, large, heads, but, they, have, round, pupils, no, loreal, pit, a, single, anal, plate, subcaudal, scales, that, are, divided, throughout, and, a, distinctive, overall, color, pattern, agkistrodon, piscivorus, venom, is, more, toxic, than, that, of, a, contortrix, and, is, rich, with, powerful, cytotoxic, venom, that, destroys, tissue, although, deaths, are, rare, the, bite, can, leave, scars, and, on, occasion, require, amputation, absent, an, anaphylactic, reaction, in, a, bitten, individual, however, the, venom, does, not, cause, systemic, reactions, in, victims, and, does, not, contain, neurotoxic, components, present, in, numerous, rattlesnake, species, bites, can, be, effectively, treated, with, crofab, antivenom, this, serum, is, derived, using, venom, components, from, four, species, of, american, pit, vipers, the, eastern, and, western, diamondback, rattlesnakes, the, mojave, rattlesnake, and, the, cottonmouth, bites, from, the, cottonmouth, are, relatively, frequent, in, the, lower, mississippi, river, valley, and, along, the, coast, of, the, gulf, of, mexico, although, fatalities, are, rare, allen, and, swindell, 1948, compiled, a, record, of, a, piscivorus, bites, in, florida, from, newspaper, accounts, and, data, from, the, bureau, of, vital, statistics, 1934, eight, bites, and, three, fatalities, no, further, fatalities, were, recorded, after, this, year, 1935, 10, 1936, 16, 1937, 7, 1938, 6, 1939, 5, 1940, 3, 1941, 6, 1942, 3, 1943, 1, 1944, 3, 1998, 1, wright, and, wright, 1957, report, having, encountered, these, snakes, on, countless, occasions, often, almost, stepping, on, them, but, never, being, bitten, in, addition, they, heard, of, no, reports, of, any, bites, among, 400, cypress, cutters, in, the, okefenokee, swamp, during, the, entire, summer, of, 1921, these, accounts, suggest, that, the, species, is, not, particularly, aggressive, studies, show, that, stressed, snakes, are, more, likely, to, strike, this, action, comes, as, a, predator, defense, mechanism, snakes, with, elevated, hormone, levels, are, more, likely, to, strike, additionally, larger, snakes, are, more, likely, to, strike, than, smaller, snakes, brown, 1973, gave, an, average, venom, yield, dried, of, 125, mg, with, a, range, of, 80, 237, mg, along, with, ld, 50, values, of, 4, 0, 2, 2, 2, 7, 3, 5, 2, 0, mg, kg, iv, 4, 8, 5, 1, 4, 0, 5, 5, 3, 8, 6, 8, mg, kg, ip, and, 25, 8, mg, kg, sc, for, toxicity, wolff, and, githens, 1939, described, a, 152, cm, 60, in, specimen, that, yielded, 3, 5, ml, of, venom, during, the, first, extraction, and, 4, 0, ml, five, weeks, later, 1, 094, grams, of, dried, venom, the, human, lethal, dose, is, unknown, but, has, been, estimated, at, 100, 150, mg, symptoms, commonly, include, ecchymosis, and, swelling, the, pain, is, generally, more, severe, than, bites, from, the, copperhead, but, less, so, than, those, from, rattlesnakes, crotalus, spp, the, formation, of, vesicles, and, bullae, is, less, common, than, with, rattlesnake, bites, although, necrosis, can, occur, myokymia, is, sometimes, reported, however, the, venom, has, strong, proteolytic, activity, that, can, lead, to, severe, tissue, destruction, a, piscivorus, is, found, in, the, eastern, us, from, the, great, dismal, swamp, in, southeast, virginia, south, through, the, florida, peninsula, and, west, to, arkansas, eastern, and, southern, oklahoma, and, western, and, southern, georgia, excluding, lake, lanier, and, lake, allatoona, a, few, records, exist, of, the, species, being, found, along, the, rio, grande, in, texas, but, these, are, thought, to, represent, disjunct, populations, now, possibly, eradicated, the, type, locality, given, is, carolina, although, schmidt, 1953, proposed, this, be, restricted, to, the, area, around, charleston, south, carolina, snakes, observed, in, the, northern, areas, of, this, range, are, typically, larger, older, individuals, campbell, and, lamar, 2004, mentioned, this, species, as, being, found, in, alabama, arkansas, florida, georgia, illinois, indiana, kentucky, louisiana, mississippi, missouri, north, carolina, oklahoma, south, carolina, tennessee, texas, and, virginia, maps, provided, by, campbell, and, lamar, 2004, and, wright, and, wright, 1957, also, indicate, its, presence, in, western, and, middle, tennessee, and, extreme, southeastern, kansas, and, limit, it, to, the, western, part, of, kentucky, in, georgia, it, is, found, in, the, southern, half, of, the, state, up, to, a, few, kilometers, north, of, the, fall, line, with, few, exceptions, its, range, also, includes, the, ohio, river, valley, as, far, north, as, southern, indiana, and, it, inhabits, many, barrier, islands, off, the, coasts, of, the, states, where, it, is, found, agkistrodon, piscivorus, is, the, most, aquatic, species, of, the, genus, agkistrodon, and, is, usually, associated, with, bodies, of, water, such, as, creeks, streams, marshes, swamps, and, the, shores, of, ponds, and, lakes, this, species, is, pretty, unique, from, others, of, its, commonly, confused, species, as, cottonmouths, appear, to, be, floating, on, top, of, the, water, rather, than, swimming, with, its, body, beneath, the, surface, the, u, s, navy, 1991, describes, it, as, inhabiting, swamps, shallow, lakes, and, sluggish, streams, but, it, is, usually, not, found, in, swift, deep, cool, water, behler, and, king, 1979, list, its, habitats, as, including, lowland, swamps, lakes, rivers, bayheads, sloughs, irrigation, ditches, canals, rice, fields, and, small, clear, rocky, mountain, streams, it, is, also, found, in, brackish, water, habitats, and, is, sometimes, seen, swimming, in, salt, water, it, has, been, much, more, successful, at, colonizing, atlantic, and, gulf, coast, barrier, islands, than, the, copperhead, even, on, these, islands, though, it, tends, to, favor, freshwater, marshes, a, study, by, dunson, and, freda, 1985, describes, it, as, not, being, particularly, salt, tolerant, the, snake, is, not, limited, to, aquatic, habitats, however, as, gloyd, and, conant, 1990, mentioned, large, specimens, have, been, found, more, than, a, mile, 1, 6, km, from, water, in, various, locations, the, species, is, well, adapted, to, less, moist, environments, such, as, palmetto, thickets, pine, palmetto, forest, pine, woods, in, east, texas, pine, flatwoods, in, florida, eastern, deciduous, dune, forest, dune, and, beach, areas, riparian, forest, and, prairies, in, tests, designed, to, measure, the, various, behavioral, responses, by, wild, specimens, to, encounters, with, people, 23, of, 45, 51, tried, to, escape, while, 28, of, 36, 78, resorted, to, threat, displays, and, other, defensive, tactics, only, when, they, were, picked, up, with, a, mechanical, hand, were, they, likely, to, bite, when, sufficiently, stressed, or, threatened, this, species, engages, in, a, characteristic, threat, display, that, includes, vibrating, its, tail, and, throwing, its, head, back, with, its, mouth, open, to, display, the, startlingly, white, interior, often, making, a, loud, hiss, while, the, neck, and, front, part, of, the, body, are, pulled, into, an, s, shaped, position, many, of, its, common, names, including, cottonmouth, and, gaper, refer, to, this, behavior, while, its, habit, of, snapping, its, jaws, shut, when, anything, touches, its, mouth, has, earned, it, the, name, trap, jaw, in, some, areas, other, defensive, responses, can, include, flattening, the, body, and, emitting, a, strong, pungent, secretion, from, the, anal, glands, located, at, the, base, of, the, tail, this, musk, may, be, ejected, in, thin, jets, if, the, snake, is, sufficiently, agitated, or, restrained, the, smell, has, been, likened, to, that, of, a, billy, goat, as, well, as, to, a, genus, of, common, flood, plain, weeds, pluchea, that, also, have, a, penetrating, odor, harmless, watersnakes, of, the, genus, nerodia, are, often, mistaken, for, it, these, are, also, semiaquatic, thick, bodied, snakes, with, large, heads, that, can, be, aggressive, when, provoked, but, they, behave, differently, for, example, watersnakes, usually, flee, quickly, into, the, water, while, a, piscivorus, often, stands, its, ground, with, its, threat, display, in, addition, watersnakes, do, not, vibrate, their, tails, when, excited, a, piscivorus, usually, holds, its, head, at, an, angle, around, 45, when, swimming, or, crawling, brown, 1973, considered, their, heavy, muscular, bodies, to, be, a, striking, characteristic, stating, this, made, it, difficult, to, hold, them, for, venom, extraction, owing, to, their, strength, this, species, may, be, active, during, the, day, and, at, night, but, on, bright, sunny, days, they, are, usually, found, coiled, or, stretched, out, in, the, shade, in, the, morning, and, on, cool, days, they, can, often, be, seen, basking, in, the, sunlight, they, often, emerge, at, sunset, to, warm, themselves, on, warm, ground, i, e, sidewalks, roads, and, then, become, very, active, throughout, the, night, when, they, are, usually, found, swimming, or, crawling, contrary, to, popular, belief, they, are, capable, of, biting, while, under, water, in, the, north, they, hibernate, during, the, winter, niell, 1947, 1948, made, observations, in, georgia, and, noted, they, were, one, of, the, last, species, to, seek, shelter, often, being, found, active, until, the, first, heavy, frosts, at, this, point, they, moved, to, higher, ground, and, could, be, found, in, rotting, pine, stumps, by, tearing, away, the, bark, these, snakes, could, be, quite, active, upon, discovery, and, would, then, attempt, to, burrow, more, deeply, into, the, soft, wood, or, escape, to, the, nearest, water, in, southeastern, virginia, wood, 1954, reported, seeing, migratory, behavior, in, late, october, and, early, november, during, a, period, of, three, or, four, days, as, many, as, 50, individuals, could, be, seen, swimming, across, back, bay, from, the, bayside, swamps, of, the, barrier, islands, to, the, mainland, he, suggested, this, might, have, something, to, do, with, hibernating, habits, in, the, southern, parts, of, its, range, hibernation, may, be, short, or, omitted, altogether, raymond, ditmars, 1912, described, a, piscivorus, as, carnivorous, its, diet, includes, mammals, birds, amphibians, fish, eggs, insects, other, snakes, small, turtles, and, small, alligators, cannibalism, has, also, been, reported, normally, though, the, bulk, of, its, diet, consists, of, fish, and, frogs, on, occasion, juvenile, specimens, feed, on, invertebrates, catfish, especially, of, the, genus, ictalurus, are, often, eaten, although, the, sharp, spines, sometimes, cause, injuries, toads, of, the, genus, bufo, are, apparently, avoided, common, prey, species, include, southern, leopard, frogs, bass, juvenile, black, rat, snakes, young, common, snapping, turtles, and, north, american, least, shrews, many, authors, have, described, the, prey, items, taken, under, natural, circumstances, although, fish, and, frogs, are, their, most, common, prey, they, eat, almost, any, small, vertebrate, fish, are, captured, by, cornering, them, in, shallow, water, usually, against, the, bank, or, under, logs, they, take, advantage, when, bodies, of, water, begin, to, dry, up, in, the, summer, or, early, fall, and, gorge, themselves, on, the, resulting, high, concentrations, of, fish, and, tadpoles, they, are, surprisingly, unsuccessful, at, seizing, either, live, or, dead, fish, under, water, they, are, opportunistic, hunters, and, sometimes, eat, carrion, making, them, one, of, the, few, snakes, to, do, so, campbell, and, lamar, 2004, described, having, seen, them, feeding, on, fish, heads, and, viscera, that, had, been, thrown, into, the, water, from, a, dock, heinrich, and, studenroth, 1996, reported, an, occasion, in, which, an, individual, was, seen, feeding, on, the, butchered, remains, of, a, feral, hog, sus, scrofa, that, had, been, thrown, into, cypress, creek, northern, cottonmouths, have, an, unusual, feeding, adaptation, that, allows, them, to, adhere, to, prey, through, rotation, of, their, head, during, swallowing, because, it, aids, the, jaws, in, clearing, the, prey, and, contributes, to, the, advance, of, the, jaws, along, the, prey, conant, 1929, gave, a, detailed, account, of, the, feeding, behavior, of, a, captive, specimen, from, south, carolina, when, prey, was, introduced, the, snake, quickly, became, attentive, and, made, an, attack, frogs, and, small, birds, were, seized, and, held, until, movement, stopped, larger, prey, was, approached, in, a, more, cautious, manner, a, rapid, strike, was, executed, after, which, the, snake, would, withdraw, in, 2, 5, years, the, snake, had, accepted, three, species, of, frogs, including, a, large, bullfrog, a, spotted, salamander, water, snakes, garter, snakes, sparrows, young, rats, and, three, species, of, mice, brimley, 1944, described, a, captive, specimen, that, ate, copperheads, a, contortrix, as, well, as, members, of, its, own, species, keeping, its, fangs, embedded, in, its, victims, until, they, had, been, immobilized, a, 2018, study, found, that, northern, cottonmouths, on, a, diet, of, only, fish, when, compared, to, a, diet, of, mice, had, to, eat, 20, more, to, achieve, the, same, growth, there, have, been, several, studies, focusing, on, the, types, of, prey, that, cottonmouths, consume, and, analyzing, the, differences, between, juveniles, adult, males, and, adult, females, it, has, been, found, that, adult, males, and, females, target, different, prey, types, and, sizes, observations, and, stomach, analyses, show, that, adult, males, consume, fish, whereas, adult, females, mainly, consume, other, squamates, in, particularly, snakes, in, this, same, research, it, was, concluded, that, the, prey, size, increased, with, the, size, of, the, snake, for, both, juvenile, and, adults, both, male, and, female, young, individuals, have, yellowish, or, greenish, tail, tips, and, engage, in, caudal, luring, the, tail, tip, is, wriggled, to, lure, prey, such, as, frogs, and, lizards, within, striking, distance, wharton, 1960, observed, captive, specimens, exhibiting, this, behavior, between, 07, 20, and, 19, 40, hours, which, suggests, it, is, a, daytime, activity, in, august, 2020, and, may, 2021, individuals, found, in, florida, were, observed, to, have, consumed, introduced, burmese, pythons, python, bivittatus, burmese, pythons, are, an, invasive, species, in, florida, with, the, capacity, to, inflict, great, damage, to, the, local, ecosystem, so, it, is, hoped, that, a, piscivorus, may, be, in, the, process, of, modifying, its, diet, to, enable, it, to, hunt, the, pythons, agkistrodon, piscivorus, is, preyed, upon, by, snapping, turtles, chelydra, serpentina, falcons, american, alligators, alligator, mississippiensis, horned, owls, bubo, virginianus, eagles, red, shouldered, hawks, buteo, lineatus, loggerhead, shrikes, lanius, ludovicianus, and, large, wading, birds, such, as, herons, cranes, and, egrets, it, is, also, preyed, upon, by, ophiophagous, snakes, including, their, own, species, humphreys, 1881, described, how, a, 34, inch, 86, cm, specimen, was, killed, and, eaten, by, a, 42, inch, 1, 1, m, captive, kingsnake, on, the, other, hand, neill, 1947, reported, captive, kingsnakes, lampropeltis, getula, were, loath, to, attack, them, being, successfully, repelled, with, body, blows, also, called, body, bridging, this, is, a, specific, defensive, behavior, against, ophiophagous, snakes, first, observed, in, certain, rattlesnake, crotalus, species, by, klauber, 1927, that, involves, raising, a, section, of, the, middle, of, the, body, above, the, ground, to, varying, heights, this, raised, loop, may, then, be, held, in, this, position, for, varying, amounts, of, time, shifted, in, position, or, moved, towards, the, attacker, in, the, latter, case, it, is, often, flipped, or, thrown, vigorously, in, the, direction, of, the, assailant, in, a, piscivorus, the, loop, is, raised, laterally, with, the, belly, facing, towards, the, attacker, agkistrodon, piscivorus, is, ovoviviparous, with, females, usually, giving, birth, to, one, to, 16, live, young, and, possibly, as, many, as, 20, litters, of, six, to, eight, are, the, most, common, neonates, are, 22, 35, cm, 8, 7, 13, 8, in, in, length, excluding, runts, with, the, largest, belonging, to, a, p, conanti, and, a, p, leucostoma, the, smallest, if, weather, conditions, are, favorable, and, food, is, readily, available, growth, is, rapid, and, females, may, reproduce, at, less, than, three, years, of, age, and, a, total, length, of, as, little, as, 60, cm, 24, in, they, will, also, only, reproduce, every, other, year, unless, optimal, conditions, are, met, for, them, to, go, through, the, reproduction, process, the, young, are, born, in, august, or, september, while, mating, may, occur, during, any, of, the, warmer, months, of, the, year, at, least, in, certain, parts, of, its, range, regarding, a, p, piscivorus, an, early, account, by, stejneger, 1895, described, a, pair, in, the, berlin, zoological, garden, that, mated, on, january, 21, 1873, after, which, eight, neonates, were, discovered, in, the, cage, on, july, 16, of, that, year, the, young, were, each, 26, cm, 10, in, in, length, and, 1, 5, cm, 0, 59, in, thick, they, shed, for, the, first, time, within, two, weeks, after, which, they, accepted, small, frogs, but, not, fish, combat, behavior, between, males, has, been, reported, on, a, number, of, occasions, and, is, very, similar, in, form, to, that, seen, in, many, other, viperid, species, an, important, factor, in, sexual, selection, it, allows, for, the, establishment, and, recognition, of, dominance, as, males, compete, for, access, to, sexually, active, females, a, few, accounts, exist, that, describe, females, defending, their, newborn, litters, wharten, 1960, 1966, reported, several, cases, where, females, found, near, their, young, stood, their, ground, and, considered, these, to, be, examples, of, guarding, behavior, another, case, was, described, by, walters, and, card, 1996, in, which, a, female, was, found, at, the, entrance, of, a, chamber, with, seven, neonates, crawling, on, or, around, her, when, one, of, the, young, was, moved, a, short, distance, from, the, chamber, she, seemed, to, be, agitated, and, faced, the, intruder, eventually, all, of, her, offspring, retreated, into, the, chamber, but, the, female, remained, at, the, entrance, ready, to, strike, one, study, stated, that, females, will, remain, with, their, young, for, one, to, two, weeks, until, the, young, finishes, their, first, shed, cycle, parthenogenesis, is, a, natural, form, of, reproduction, in, which, growth, and, development, of, embryos, occur, without, fertilization, a, piscivorus, can, reproduce, by, facultative, parthenogenesis, that, is, they, are, capable, of, switching, from, a, sexual, mode, of, reproduction, to, an, asexual, mode, this, likely, involves, recombination, at, the, tips, of, the, chromosomes, which, leads, to, genome, wide, homozygosity, the, result, is, the, expression, of, deleterious, recessive, alleles, and, often, to, developmental, failure, inbreeding, depression, both, captive, born, and, wild, born, a, piscivorus, specimens, appear, to, be, capable, of, this, form, of, parthenogenesis, the, species, a, piscivorus, is, classified, as, least, concern, on, the, iucn, red, list, v3, 1, 2007, species, are, listed, as, such, due, to, their, wide, distribution, presumed, large, population, or, because, they, are, unlikely, to, be, declining, fast, enough, to, qualify, for, listing, in, a, more, threatened, category, when, last, assessed, in, 2007, the, population, trend, was, stable, constant, persecution, of, the, species, and, drainage, of, wetland, habitat, prior, to, development, has, taken, a, heavy, toll, on, local, populations, despite, this, it, remains, a, common, species, in, many, areas, in, indiana, the, cottonmouth, is, listed, as, an, endangered, species
