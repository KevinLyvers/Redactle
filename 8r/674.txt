old, world, sparrows, are, a, group, of, small, passerine, birds, forming, the, family, passeridae, they, are, also, known, as, true, sparrows, a, name, also, used, for, a, particular, genus, of, the, family, passer, they, are, distinct, from, both, the, new, world, sparrows, in, the, family, passerellidae, and, from, a, few, other, birds, sharing, their, name, such, as, the, java, sparrow, of, the, family, estrildidae, many, species, nest, on, buildings, and, the, house, and, eurasian, tree, sparrows, in, particular, inhabit, cities, in, large, numbers, they, are, primarily, seed, eaters, though, they, also, consume, small, insects, some, species, scavenge, for, food, around, cities, and, like, pigeons, or, gulls, will, eat, small, quantities, of, a, diversity, of, items, generally, old, world, sparrows, are, small, plump, brown, and, grey, birds, with, short, tails, and, stubby, powerful, beaks, the, differences, between, sparrow, species, can, be, subtle, members, of, this, family, range, in, size, from, the, chestnut, sparrow, passer, eminibey, at, 11, 4, centimetres, 4, 5, in, and, 13, 4, grams, 0, 47, oz, to, the, parrot, billed, sparrow, passer, gongonensis, at, 18, centimetres, 7, 1, in, and, 42, grams, 1, 5, oz, sparrows, are, physically, similar, to, other, seed, eating, birds, such, as, finches, but, have, a, vestigial, dorsal, outer, primary, feather, and, an, extra, bone, in, the, tongue, this, bone, the, preglossale, helps, stiffen, the, tongue, when, holding, seeds, other, adaptations, for, eating, seeds, are, specialised, bills, and, elongated, and, specialised, alimentary, canals, the, family, passeridae, was, introduced, as, passernia, by, the, french, polymath, constantine, samuel, rafinesque, in, 1815, under, the, classification, used, in, the, handbook, of, the, birds, of, the, world, hbw, main, groupings, of, the, sparrows, are, the, true, sparrows, genus, passer, the, snowfinches, typically, one, genus, montifringilla, and, the, rock, sparrows, petronia, and, the, pale, rockfinch, these, groups, are, similar, to, each, other, and, are, each, fairly, homogeneous, especially, passer, some, classifications, also, include, the, sparrow, weavers, plocepasser, and, several, other, african, genera, otherwise, classified, among, the, weavers, ploceidae, which, are, morphologically, similar, to, passer, according, to, a, study, of, molecular, and, skeletal, evidence, by, jon, fjelds, and, colleagues, the, cinnamon, ibon, of, the, philippines, previously, considered, to, be, a, white, eye, is, a, sister, taxon, to, the, sparrows, as, defined, by, the, hbw, they, therefore, classify, it, as, its, own, subfamily, within, passeridae, many, early, classifications, of, the, old, world, sparrows, placed, them, as, close, relatives, of, the, weavers, among, the, various, families, of, small, seed, eating, birds, based, on, the, similarity, of, their, breeding, behaviour, bill, structure, and, moult, among, other, characters, some, starting, with, p, p, suskin, in, the, 1920s, placed, the, sparrows, in, the, weaver, family, as, the, subfamily, passerinae, and, tied, them, to, plocepasser, another, family, sparrows, were, classed, with, was, the, finches, fringillidae, some, authorities, previously, classified, the, related, estrildid, finches, of, the, old, world, tropics, and, australasia, as, members, of, the, passeridae, like, sparrows, the, estrildid, finches, are, small, gregarious, and, often, colonial, seed, eaters, with, short, thick, but, pointed, bills, they, are, broadly, similar, in, structure, and, habits, but, tend, to, be, very, colourful, and, vary, greatly, in, their, plumage, the, 2008, christidis, and, boles, taxonomic, scheme, lists, the, estrildid, finches, as, the, separate, family, estrildidae, leaving, just, the, true, sparrows, in, passeridae, despite, some, resemblance, such, as, the, seed, eater, s, bill, and, frequently, well, marked, heads, new, world, sparrows, are, members, of, a, different, family, passerellidae, with, 29, genera, recognised, several, species, in, this, family, are, notable, singers, new, world, sparrows, are, related, to, old, world, buntings, and, until, 2017, were, included, in, the, old, world, bunting, family, emberizidae, the, hedge, sparrow, or, dunnock, prunella, modularis, is, similarly, unrelated, it, is, a, sparrow, in, name, only, a, relict, of, the, old, practice, of, calling, more, types, of, small, birds, sparrows, a, few, further, bird, species, are, also, called, sparrows, such, as, the, java, sparrow, an, estrildid, finch, gymnoris, 4, species, passer, 28, species, petronia, rock, sparrow, onychostruthus, white, rumped, snowfinch, montifringilla, 3, species, pyrgilauda, 4, species, the, family, contains, 43, species, divided, into, eight, genera, the, old, world, sparrows, are, indigenous, to, europe, africa, and, asia, in, the, americas, australia, and, other, parts, of, the, world, settlers, imported, some, species, which, quickly, naturalised, particularly, in, urban, and, degraded, areas, house, sparrows, for, example, are, now, found, throughout, north, america, australia, every, state, except, western, australia, parts, of, southern, and, eastern, africa, and, over, much, of, the, heavily, populated, parts, of, south, america, the, old, world, sparrows, are, generally, birds, of, open, habitats, including, grasslands, deserts, and, scrubland, the, snowfinches, and, ground, sparrows, are, all, species, of, high, latitudes, a, few, species, like, the, eurasian, tree, sparrow, inhabit, open, woodland, the, aberrant, cinnamon, ibon, has, the, most, unusual, habitat, of, the, family, inhabiting, the, canopy, of, cloud, forest, in, the, philippines, old, world, sparrows, are, generally, social, birds, with, many, species, breeding, in, loose, colonies, and, most, species, occurring, in, flocks, during, the, non, breeding, season, the, great, sparrow, is, an, exception, breeding, in, solitary, pairs, and, remaining, only, in, small, family, groups, in, the, non, breeding, season, they, form, large, roosting, aggregations, in, the, non, breeding, seasons, that, contain, only, a, single, species, in, contrast, to, multi, species, flocks, that, might, gather, for, foraging, sites, are, chosen, for, cover, and, include, trees, thick, bushes, and, reed, beds, the, assemblages, can, be, quite, large, with, up, to, 10, 000, house, sparrows, counted, in, one, roost, in, egypt, the, old, world, sparrows, are, some, of, the, few, passerine, birds, that, engage, in, dust, bathing, they, will, first, scratch, a, hole, in, the, ground, with, their, feet, then, lie, in, it, and, fling, dirt, or, sand, over, their, bodies, with, flicks, of, their, wings, they, will, also, bathe, in, water, or, in, dry, or, melting, snow, water, bathing, is, similar, to, dust, bathing, with, the, sparrow, standing, in, shallow, water, and, flicking, water, over, its, back, with, its, wings, also, ducking, its, head, under, the, water, both, activities, are, social, with, up, to, a, hundred, birds, participating, at, once, and, is, followed, by, preening, and, sometimes, group, singing, the, house, sparrow, typically, lays, 3, 6, eggs, but, has, been, known, to, lay, as, few, as, 1, and, as, many, as, 8, greenish, white, eggs, the, incubation, period, is, typically, 10, 14, days, old, world, sparrows, may, be, the, most, familiar, of, all, wild, birds, worldwide, many, species, commonly, live, in, agricultural, areas, and, for, several, human, settlements, are, a, primary, habitat, the, eurasian, tree, and, house, sparrows, are, particularly, specialised, in, living, around, humans, and, inhabit, cities, in, large, numbers, 17, of, the, 26, species, recognised, by, the, handbook, of, the, birds, of, the, world, are, known, to, nest, on, and, feed, around, buildings, grain, eating, species, in, particular, the, house, and, sudan, golden, sparrows, can, be, significant, agricultural, pests, they, can, be, beneficial, to, humans, as, well, especially, by, eating, insect, pests, attempts, at, large, scale, control, have, failed, to, affect, populations, significantly, or, have, been, accompanied, by, major, increases, in, insect, attacks, probably, resulting, from, a, reduction, of, numbers, as, in, the, great, sparrow, campaign, in, 1950s, china, because, of, their, familiarity, the, house, sparrow, and, other, species, of, the, family, are, frequently, used, to, represent, the, common, and, vulgar, or, the, lewd, birds, usually, described, later, as, old, world, sparrows, are, referred, to, in, many, works, of, ancient, literature, and, religious, texts, in, europe, and, western, asia, these, references, may, not, always, refer, specifically, to, old, world, sparrows, or, even, to, small, seed, eating, birds, but, later, writers, who, were, inspired, by, these, texts, often, had, the, house, sparrow, and, other, members, of, the, family, in, mind, in, particular, old, world, sparrows, were, associated, by, the, ancient, greeks, with, aphrodite, the, goddess, of, love, due, to, their, perceived, lustfulness, an, association, echoed, by, later, writers, such, as, chaucer, and, shakespeare, jesus, s, use, of, sparrows, as, an, example, of, divine, providence, in, the, gospel, of, matthew, also, inspired, later, references, such, as, that, in, the, final, scene, of, shakespeare, s, hamlet, and, the, gospel, hymn, his, eye, is, on, the, sparrow, old, world, sparrows, have, been, kept, as, pets, at, many, times, in, history, even, though, most, are, not, particularly, colourful, and, their, songs, are, unremarkable, they, are, also, difficult, to, keep, as, pet, sparrows, must, be, raised, by, hand, and, a, considerable, amount, of, insects, are, required, to, feed, them, nevertheless, many, people, succeed, at, hand, raising, orphaned, or, abandoned, baby, sparrows, the, earliest, mentions, of, pet, sparrows, are, from, the, romans, not, all, the, passeri, mentioned, often, as, pets, in, roman, literature, were, necessarily, sparrows, but, some, accounts, of, them, clearly, describe, their, appearance, and, habits, the, pet, passer, of, lesbia, in, catullus, s, poems, may, not, have, been, a, sparrow, but, a, thrush, or, european, goldfinch, john, skelton, s, the, boke, of, phyllyp, sparowe, is, a, lament, for, a, pet, house, sparrow, belonging, to, a, jane, scrope, narrated, by, scrope
