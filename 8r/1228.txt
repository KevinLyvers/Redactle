vaccination, is, the, administration, of, a, vaccine, to, help, the, immune, system, develop, immunity, from, a, disease, vaccines, contain, a, microorganism, or, virus, in, a, weakened, live, or, killed, state, or, proteins, or, toxins, from, the, organism, in, stimulating, the, body, s, adaptive, immunity, they, help, prevent, sickness, from, an, infectious, disease, when, a, sufficiently, large, percentage, of, a, population, has, been, vaccinated, herd, immunity, results, herd, immunity, protects, those, who, may, be, immunocompromised, and, cannot, get, a, vaccine, because, even, a, weakened, version, would, harm, them, the, effectiveness, of, vaccination, has, been, widely, studied, and, verified, vaccination, is, the, most, effective, method, of, preventing, infectious, diseases, widespread, immunity, due, to, vaccination, is, largely, responsible, for, the, worldwide, eradication, of, smallpox, and, the, elimination, of, diseases, such, as, polio, and, tetanus, from, much, of, the, world, however, some, diseases, such, as, measles, outbreaks, in, america, have, seen, rising, cases, due, to, relatively, low, vaccination, rates, in, the, 2010s, attributed, in, part, to, vaccine, hesitancy, according, to, the, world, health, organization, vaccination, prevents, 3, 5, 5, million, deaths, per, year, the, first, disease, people, tried, to, prevent, by, inoculation, was, most, likely, smallpox, with, the, first, recorded, use, of, variolation, occurring, in, the, 16th, century, in, china, it, was, also, the, first, disease, for, which, a, vaccine, was, produced, although, at, least, six, people, had, used, the, same, principles, years, earlier, the, smallpox, vaccine, was, invented, in, 1796, by, english, physician, edward, jenner, he, was, the, first, to, publish, evidence, that, it, was, effective, and, to, provide, advice, on, its, production, louis, pasteur, furthered, the, concept, through, his, work, in, microbiology, the, immunization, was, called, vaccination, because, it, was, derived, from, a, virus, affecting, cows, latin, vacca, cow, smallpox, was, a, contagious, and, deadly, disease, causing, the, deaths, of, 20, 60, of, infected, adults, and, over, 80, of, infected, children, when, smallpox, was, finally, eradicated, in, 1979, it, had, already, killed, an, estimated, 300, 500, million, people, in, the, 20th, century, vaccination, and, immunization, have, a, similar, meaning, in, everyday, language, this, is, distinct, from, inoculation, which, uses, unweakened, live, pathogens, vaccination, efforts, have, been, met, with, some, reluctance, on, scientific, ethical, political, medical, safety, and, religious, grounds, although, no, major, religions, oppose, vaccination, and, some, consider, it, an, obligation, due, to, the, potential, to, save, lives, in, the, united, states, people, may, receive, compensation, for, alleged, injuries, under, the, national, vaccine, injury, compensation, program, early, success, brought, widespread, acceptance, and, mass, vaccination, campaigns, have, greatly, reduced, the, incidence, of, many, diseases, in, numerous, geographic, regions, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, lists, vaccination, as, one, of, the, ten, great, public, health, achievements, of, the, 20th, century, in, the, u, s, vaccines, are, a, way, of, artificially, activating, the, immune, system, to, protect, against, infectious, disease, the, activation, occurs, through, priming, the, immune, system, with, an, immunogen, stimulating, immune, responses, with, an, infectious, agent, is, known, as, immunization, vaccination, includes, various, ways, of, administering, immunogens, most, vaccines, are, administered, before, a, patient, has, contracted, a, disease, to, help, increase, future, protection, however, some, vaccines, are, administered, after, the, patient, already, has, contracted, a, disease, vaccines, given, after, exposure, to, smallpox, are, reported, to, offer, some, protection, from, disease, or, may, reduce, the, severity, of, disease, the, first, rabies, immunization, was, given, by, louis, pasteur, to, a, child, after, he, was, bitten, by, a, rabid, dog, since, its, discovery, the, rabies, vaccine, has, been, proven, effective, in, preventing, rabies, in, humans, when, administered, several, times, over, 14, days, along, with, rabies, immune, globulin, and, wound, care, other, examples, include, experimental, aids, cancer, and, alzheimer, s, disease, vaccines, such, immunizations, aim, to, trigger, an, immune, response, more, rapidly, and, with, less, harm, than, natural, infection, most, vaccines, are, given, by, injection, as, they, are, not, absorbed, reliably, through, the, intestines, live, attenuated, polio, rotavirus, some, typhoid, and, some, cholera, vaccines, are, given, orally, to, produce, immunity, in, the, bowel, while, vaccination, provides, a, lasting, effect, it, usually, takes, several, weeks, to, develop, this, differs, from, passive, immunity, the, transfer, of, antibodies, such, as, in, breastfeeding, which, has, immediate, effect, a, vaccine, failure, is, when, an, organism, contracts, a, disease, in, spite, of, being, vaccinated, against, it, primary, vaccine, failure, occurs, when, an, organism, s, immune, system, does, not, produce, antibodies, when, first, vaccinated, vaccines, can, fail, when, several, series, are, given, and, fail, to, produce, an, immune, response, the, term, vaccine, failure, does, not, necessarily, imply, that, the, vaccine, is, defective, most, vaccine, failures, are, simply, due, to, individual, variations, in, immune, response, the, term, inoculation, is, often, used, interchangeably, with, vaccination, however, while, related, the, terms, are, not, synonymous, vaccination, is, treatment, of, an, individual, with, an, attenuated, i, e, less, virulent, pathogen, or, other, immunogen, whereas, inoculation, also, called, variolation, in, the, context, of, smallpox, prophylaxis, is, treatment, with, unattenuated, variola, virus, taken, from, a, pustule, or, scab, of, a, smallpox, patient, into, the, superficial, layers, of, the, skin, commonly, the, upper, arm, variolation, was, often, done, arm, to, arm, or, less, effectively, scab, to, arm, and, often, caused, the, patient, to, become, infected, with, smallpox, which, in, some, cases, resulted, in, severe, disease, vaccinations, began, in, the, late, 18th, century, with, the, work, of, edward, jenner, and, the, smallpox, vaccine, some, vaccines, like, the, smallpox, vaccine, prevent, infection, their, use, results, in, sterilizing, immunity, and, can, help, eradicate, a, disease, if, there, is, no, animal, reserve, other, vaccines, including, those, for, covid, 19, help, to, temporarily, lower, the, chance, of, severe, disease, for, individuals, without, necessarily, reducing, the, probability, of, becoming, infected, just, like, any, medication, or, procedure, no, vaccine, can, be, 100, safe, or, effective, for, everyone, because, each, person, s, body, can, react, differently, while, minor, side, effects, such, as, soreness, or, low, grade, fever, are, relatively, common, serious, side, effects, are, very, rare, and, occur, in, about, 1, out, of, every, 100, 000, vaccinations, and, typically, involve, allergic, reactions, that, can, cause, hives, or, difficulty, breathing, however, vaccines, are, the, safest, they, ever, have, been, in, history, and, each, vaccine, undergoes, rigorous, clinical, trials, to, ensure, their, safety, and, efficacy, before, approval, by, authorities, such, as, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, prior, to, human, testing, vaccines, are, tested, on, cell, cultures, and, the, results, modelled, to, assess, how, they, will, interact, with, the, immune, system, during, the, next, round, of, testing, researchers, study, vaccines, in, animals, including, mice, rabbits, guinea, pigs, and, monkeys, vaccines, that, pass, each, of, these, stages, of, testing, are, then, approved, by, the, public, health, safety, authority, fda, in, the, united, states, to, start, a, three, phase, series, of, human, testing, advancing, to, higher, phases, only, if, they, are, deemed, safe, and, effective, at, the, previous, phase, the, people, in, these, trials, participate, voluntarily, and, are, required, to, prove, they, understand, the, purpose, of, the, study, and, the, potential, risks, during, phase, i, trials, a, vaccine, is, tested, in, a, group, of, about, 20, people, with, the, primary, goal, of, assessing, the, vaccine, s, safety, phase, ii, trials, expand, the, testing, to, include, 50, to, several, hundred, people, during, this, stage, the, vaccine, s, safety, continues, to, be, evaluated, and, researchers, also, gather, data, on, the, effectiveness, and, the, ideal, dose, of, the, vaccine, vaccines, determined, to, be, safe, and, efficacious, then, advance, to, phase, iii, trials, which, focuses, on, the, efficacy, of, the, vaccine, in, hundreds, to, thousands, of, volunteers, this, phase, can, take, several, years, to, complete, and, researchers, use, this, opportunity, to, compare, the, vaccinated, volunteers, to, those, who, have, not, been, vaccinated, to, highlight, any, true, reactions, to, the, vaccine, that, occur, if, a, vaccine, passes, all, of, the, phases, of, testing, the, manufacturer, can, then, apply, for, license, of, the, vaccine, through, the, relevant, regulatory, authorities, such, as, the, fda, in, us, before, regulatory, authorities, approve, use, in, the, general, public, they, extensively, review, the, results, of, the, clinical, trials, safety, tests, purity, tests, and, manufacturing, methods, and, establish, that, the, manufacturer, itself, is, up, to, government, standards, in, many, other, areas, after, regulatory, approval, the, regulators, continue, to, monitor, the, manufacturing, protocols, batch, purity, and, the, manufacturing, facility, itself, additionally, vaccines, also, undergo, phase, iv, trials, which, monitor, the, safety, and, efficacy, of, vaccines, in, tens, of, thousands, of, people, or, more, across, many, years, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, has, compiled, a, list, of, vaccines, and, their, possible, side, effects, the, risk, of, side, effects, varies, between, vaccines, in, 1976, in, the, united, states, a, mass, swine, flu, vaccination, programme, was, discontinued, after, 362, cases, of, guillain, barr, syndrome, among, 45, million, vaccinated, people, william, foege, of, the, cdc, estimated, that, the, incidence, of, guillain, barr, was, four, times, higher, in, vaccinated, people, than, in, those, not, receiving, the, swine, flu, vaccine, dengvaxia, the, only, approved, vaccine, for, dengue, fever, was, found, to, increase, the, risk, of, hospitalization, for, dengue, fever, by, 1, 58, times, in, children, of, 9, years, or, younger, resulting, in, the, suspension, of, a, mass, vaccination, program, in, the, philippines, in, 2017, pandemrix, a, vaccine, for, the, h1n1, pandemic, of, 2009, given, to, around, 31, million, people, was, found, to, have, a, higher, level, of, adverse, events, than, alternative, vaccines, resulting, in, legal, action, in, a, response, to, the, narcolepsy, reports, following, immunization, with, pandemrix, the, cdc, carried, out, a, population, based, study, and, found, the, fda, approved, 2009, h1n1, flu, shots, were, not, associated, with, an, increased, risk, for, the, neurological, disorder, the, ingredients, of, vaccines, can, vary, greatly, from, one, to, the, next, and, no, two, vaccines, are, the, same, the, cdc, has, compiled, a, list, of, vaccines, and, their, ingredients, that, is, readily, accessible, on, their, website, aluminium, is, an, adjuvant, ingredient, in, some, vaccines, an, adjuvant, is, a, type, of, ingredient, that, is, used, to, help, the, body, s, immune, system, create, a, stronger, immune, response, after, receiving, the, vaccination, aluminium, is, in, a, salt, form, the, ionic, version, of, an, element, and, is, used, in, the, following, compounds, aluminium, hydroxide, aluminium, phosphate, and, aluminium, potassium, sulfate, for, a, given, element, the, ion, form, has, different, properties, from, the, elemental, form, although, it, is, possible, to, have, aluminium, toxicity, aluminium, salts, have, been, used, effectively, and, safely, since, the, 1930s, when, they, were, first, used, with, the, diphtheria, and, tetanus, vaccines, although, there, is, a, small, increase, in, the, chance, of, having, a, local, reaction, to, a, vaccine, with, an, aluminium, salt, redness, soreness, and, swelling, there, is, no, increased, risk, of, any, serious, reactions, certain, vaccines, once, contained, a, compound, called, thiomersal, or, thimerosal, which, is, an, organic, compound, containing, mercury, organomercury, is, commonly, found, in, two, forms, the, methylmercury, cation, with, one, carbon, atom, is, found, in, mercury, contaminated, fish, and, is, the, form, that, people, might, ingest, in, mercury, polluted, areas, minamata, disease, whereas, the, ethylmercury, cation, with, two, carbon, atoms, is, present, in, thimerosal, linked, to, thiosalicylate, although, both, are, organomercury, compounds, they, do, not, have, the, same, chemical, properties, and, interact, with, the, human, body, differently, ethylmercury, is, cleared, from, the, body, faster, than, methylmercury, and, is, less, likely, to, cause, toxic, effects, thimerosal, was, used, as, a, preservative, to, prevent, the, growth, of, bacteria, and, fungi, in, vials, that, contain, more, than, one, dose, of, a, vaccine, this, helps, reduce, the, risk, of, potential, infections, or, serious, illness, that, could, occur, from, contamination, of, a, vaccine, vial, although, there, was, a, small, increase, in, risk, of, injection, site, redness, and, swelling, with, vaccines, containing, thimerosal, there, was, no, increased, risk, of, serious, harm, or, autism, even, though, evidence, supports, the, safety, and, efficacy, of, thimerosal, in, vaccines, thimerosal, was, removed, from, childhood, vaccines, in, the, united, states, in, 2001, as, a, precaution, cdc, immunization, safety, office,

deaths, per, year, and, up, to, 1, 5, million, children, die, each, year, due, to, diseases, that, could, have, been, prevented, by, vaccination, they, estimate, that, 29, of, deaths, of, children, under, five, years, old, in, 2013, were, vaccine, preventable, in, other, developing, parts, of, the, world, they, are, faced, with, the, challenge, of, having, a, decreased, availability, of, resources, and, vaccinations, countries, such, as, those, in, sub, saharan, africa, cannot, afford, to, provide, the, full, range, of, childhood, vaccinations, in, 2024, a, who, unicef, report, found, the, number, of, children, who, received, three, doses, of, the, vaccine, against, diphtheria, tetanus, and, pertussis, dtp, in, 2023, a, key, marker, for, global, immunization, coverage, stalled, at, 84, 108, million, however, the, number, of, children, who, did, not, receive, a, single, dose, of, the, vaccine, increased, from, 13, 9, million, in, 2022, to, 14, 5, million, in, 2023, more, than, half, of, unvaccinated, children, live, in, the, 31, countries, with, fragile, conflict, affected, and, vulnerable, settings, vaccines, have, led, to, major, decreases, in, the, prevalence, of, infectious, diseases, in, the, united, states, in, 2007, studies, regarding, the, effectiveness, of, vaccines, on, mortality, or, morbidity, rates, of, those, exposed, to, various, diseases, have, shown, almost, 100, decreases, in, death, rates, and, about, a, 90, decrease, in, exposure, rates, this, has, allowed, specific, organizations, and, states, to, adopt, standards, for, recommended, early, childhood, vaccinations, lower, income, families, who, are, unable, to, otherwise, afford, vaccinations, are, supported, by, these, organizations, and, specific, government, laws, the, vaccines, for, children, program, and, the, social, security, act, are, two, major, players, in, supporting, lower, socioeconomic, groups, in, 2000, the, cdc, declared, that, measles, had, been, eliminated, in, the, us, defined, as, no, disease, transmission, for, 12, continuous, months, however, with, the, growing, anti, vaccine, movement, the, us, has, seen, a, resurgence, of, certain, vaccine, preventable, diseases, the, measles, virus, has, now, lost, its, elimination, status, in, the, us, as, the, number, of, measles, cases, continues, to, rise, in, recent, years, with, a, total, of, 17, outbreaks, in, 2018, and, 465, outbreaks, in, 2019, as, of, 4, april, 2019, before, the, first, vaccinations, in, the, sense, of, using, cowpox, to, inoculate, people, against, smallpox, people, have, been, inoculated, in, china, and, elsewhere, before, being, copied, in, the, west, by, using, smallpox, called, variolation, the, earliest, hints, of, the, practice, of, variolation, for, smallpox, in, china, come, during, the, 10th, century, the, chinese, also, practiced, the, oldest, documented, use, of, variolation, which, comes, from, wan, quan, s, 1499, 1582, douzhen, xinfa, of, 1549, they, implemented, a, method, of, nasal, insufflation, administered, by, blowing, powdered, smallpox, material, usually, scabs, up, the, nostrils, various, insufflation, techniques, have, been, recorded, throughout, the, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, centuries, within, china, 60, two, reports, on, the, chinese, practice, of, inoculation, were, received, by, the, royal, society, in, london, in, 1700, one, by, martin, lister, who, received, a, report, by, an, employee, of, the, east, india, company, stationed, in, china, and, another, by, clopton, havers, in, france, voltaire, reports, that, the, chinese, have, practiced, variolation, these, hundred, years, in, 1796, edward, jenner, a, doctor, in, berkeley, in, gloucestershire, england, tested, a, common, theory, that, a, person, who, had, contracted, cowpox, would, be, immune, from, smallpox, to, test, the, theory, he, took, cowpox, vesicles, from, a, milkmaid, named, sarah, nelmes, with, which, he, infected, an, eight, year, old, boy, named, james, phipps, and, two, months, later, he, inoculated, the, boy, with, smallpox, and, smallpox, did, not, develop, in, 1798, jenner, published, an, inquiry, into, the, causes, and, effects, of, the, variol, vaccin, which, created, widespread, interest, he, distinguished, true, and, spurious, cowpox, which, did, not, give, the, desired, effect, and, developed, an, arm, to, arm, method, of, propagating, the, vaccine, from, the, vaccinated, individual, s, pustule, early, attempts, at, confirmation, were, confounded, by, contamination, with, smallpox, but, despite, controversy, within, the, medical, profession, and, religious, opposition, to, the, use, of, animal, material, by, 1801, his, report, was, translated, into, six, languages, and, over, 100, 000, people, were, vaccinated, the, term, vaccination, was, coined, in, 1800, by, the, surgeon, richard, dunning, in, his, text, some, observations, on, vaccination, in, 1802, the, scottish, physician, helenus, scott, vaccinated, dozens, of, children, in, bombay, against, smallpox, using, jenner, s, cowpox, vaccine, in, the, same, year, scott, penned, a, letter, to, the, editor, in, the, bombay, courier, declaring, that, we, have, it, now, in, our, power, to, communicate, the, benefits, of, this, important, discovery, to, every, part, of, india, perhaps, to, china, and, the, whole, eastern, world, 243, subsequently, vaccination, became, firmly, established, in, british, india, a, vaccination, campaign, was, started, in, the, new, british, colony, of, ceylon, in, 1803, by, 1807, the, british, had, vaccinated, more, than, a, million, indians, and, sri, lankans, against, smallpox, 244, also, in, 1803, the, spanish, balmis, expedition, launched, the, first, transcontinental, effort, to, vaccinate, people, against, smallpox, following, a, smallpox, epidemic, in, 1816, the, kingdom, of, nepal, ordered, smallpox, vaccine, and, requested, the, english, veterinarian, william, moorcroft, to, help, in, launching, a, vaccination, campaign, 265, 266, in, the, same, year, a, law, was, passed, in, sweden, to, require, the, vaccination, of, children, against, smallpox, by, the, age, of, two, prussia, briefly, introduced, compulsory, vaccination, in, 1810, and, again, in, the, 1920s, but, decided, against, a, compulsory, vaccination, law, in, 1829, a, law, on, compulsory, smallpox, vaccination, was, introduced, in, the, province, of, hanover, in, the, 1820s, in, 1826, in, kragujevac, future, prince, mihailo, of, serbia, was, the, first, person, to, be, vaccinated, against, smallpox, in, the, principality, of, serbia, following, a, smallpox, epidemic, in, 1837, that, caused, 40, 000, deaths, the, british, government, initiated, a, concentrated, vaccination, policy, starting, with, the, vaccination, act, of, 1840, which, provided, for, universal, vaccination, and, prohibited, variolation, 365, the, vaccination, act, 1853, introduced, compulsory, smallpox, vaccination, in, england, and, wales, 39, the, law, followed, a, severe, outbreak, of, smallpox, in, 1851, and, 1852, it, provided, that, the, poor, law, authorities, would, continue, to, dispense, vaccination, to, all, free, of, charge, but, that, records, were, to, be, kept, on, vaccinated, children, by, the, network, of, births, registrars, 41, it, was, accepted, at, the, time, that, voluntary, vaccination, had, not, reduced, smallpox, mortality, 43, but, the, vaccination, act, 1853, was, so, badly, implemented, that, it, had, little, impact, on, the, number, of, children, vaccinated, in, england, and, wales, 50, the, u, s, supreme, court, upheld, compulsory, vaccination, laws, in, the, 1905, landmark, case, jacobson, v, massachusetts, ruling, that, laws, could, require, vaccination, to, protect, the, public, from, dangerous, communicable, diseases, however, in, practice, the, u, s, had, the, lowest, rate, of, vaccination, among, industrialized, nations, in, the, early, 20th, century, compulsory, vaccination, laws, began, to, be, enforced, in, the, u, s, after, world, war, ii, in, 1959, the, who, called, for, the, eradication, of, smallpox, worldwide, as, smallpox, was, still, endemic, in, 33, countries, in, the, 1960s, six, to, eight, children, died, each, year, in, the, u, s, from, vaccination, related, complications, according, to, the, who, there, were, in, 1966, about, 100, million, cases, of, smallpox, worldwide, causing, an, estimated, two, million, deaths, in, the, 1970s, there, was, such, a, small, risk, of, contracting, smallpox, that, the, u, s, public, health, service, recommended, for, routine, smallpox, vaccination, to, be, ended, by, 1974, the, who, smallpox, vaccination, program, had, confined, smallpox, to, parts, of, pakistan, india, bangladesh, ethiopia, and, somalia, in, 1977, the, who, recorded, the, last, case, of, smallpox, infection, acquired, outside, a, laboratory, in, somalia, in, 1980, the, who, officially, declared, the, world, free, of, smallpox, 115, 116, in, 1974, the, who, adopted, the, goal, of, universal, vaccination, by, 1990, to, protect, children, against, six, preventable, infectious, diseases, measles, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, whooping, cough, tetanus, and, tuberculosis, 119, in, the, 1980s, only, 20, to, 40, of, children, in, developing, countries, were, vaccinated, against, these, six, diseases, in, wealthy, nations, the, number, of, measles, cases, had, dropped, dramatically, after, the, introduction, of, the, measles, vaccine, in, 1963, who, figures, demonstrate, that, in, many, countries, a, decline, in, measles, vaccination, leads, to, a, resurgence, in, measles, cases, measles, are, so, contagious, that, public, health, experts, believe, a, vaccination, rate, of, 100, is, needed, to, control, the, disease, 120, despite, decades, of, mass, vaccination, polio, remains, a, threat, in, india, nigeria, somalia, niger, afghanistan, bangladesh, and, indonesia, by, 2006, global, health, experts, concluded, that, the, eradication, of, polio, was, only, possible, if, the, supply, of, drinking, water, and, sanitation, facilities, were, improved, in, slums, 124, the, deployment, of, a, combined, dpt, vaccine, against, diphtheria, pertussis, whooping, cough, and, tetanus, in, the, 1950s, was, considered, a, major, advancement, for, public, health, but, in, the, course, of, vaccination, campaigns, that, spanned, decades, dpt, vaccines, became, associated, with, large, number, of, cases, with, side, effects, despite, improved, dpt, vaccines, coming, onto, the, market, in, the, 1990s, dpt, vaccines, became, the, focus, of, anti, vaccination, campaigns, in, wealthy, nations, as, immunization, rates, fell, outbreaks, of, pertussis, increased, in, many, countries, 128, in, 2000, the, global, alliance, for, vaccines, and, immunization, was, established, to, strengthen, routine, vaccinations, and, introduce, new, and, underused, vaccines, in, countries, with, a, per, capita, gdp, of, under, us, 1000, unicef, has, reported, on, the, extent, to, which, children, missed, out, on, vaccinations, from, 2020, onwards, due, to, the, covid, 19, pandemic, by, summer, 2023, the, organisation, described, vaccination, programs, as, getting, back, on, track, to, eliminate, the, risk, of, outbreaks, of, some, diseases, at, various, times, governments, and, other, institutions, have, employed, policies, requiring, vaccination, for, all, people, for, example, an, 1853, law, required, universal, vaccination, against, smallpox, in, england, and, wales, with, fines, levied, on, people, who, did, not, comply, common, contemporary, u, s, vaccination, policies, require, that, children, receive, recommended, vaccinations, before, entering, public, school, beginning, with, early, vaccination, in, the, nineteenth, century, these, policies, were, resisted, by, a, variety, of, groups, collectively, called, antivaccinationists, who, object, on, scientific, ethical, political, medical, safety, religious, and, other, grounds, common, objections, are, that, vaccinations, do, not, work, that, compulsory, vaccination, constitutes, excessive, government, intervention, in, personal, matters, or, that, the, proposed, vaccinations, are, not, sufficiently, safe, many, modern, vaccination, policies, allow, exemptions, for, people, who, have, compromised, immune, systems, allergies, to, the, components, used, in, vaccinations, or, strongly, held, objections, in, countries, with, limited, financial, resources, limited, vaccination, coverage, results, in, greater, morbidity, and, mortality, due, to, infectious, disease, more, affluent, countries, are, able, to, subsidize, vaccinations, for, at, risk, groups, resulting, in, more, comprehensive, and, effective, coverage, in, australia, for, example, the, government, subsidizes, vaccinations, for, seniors, and, indigenous, australians, public, health, law, research, an, independent, us, based, organization, reported, in, 2009, that, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, assess, the, effectiveness, of, requiring, vaccinations, as, a, condition, for, specified, jobs, as, a, means, of, reducing, incidence, of, specific, diseases, among, particularly, vulnerable, populations, that, there, is, sufficient, evidence, supporting, the, effectiveness, of, requiring, vaccinations, as, a, condition, for, attending, child, care, facilities, and, schools, and, that, there, is, strong, evidence, supporting, the, effectiveness, of, standing, orders, which, allow, healthcare, workers, without, prescription, authority, to, administer, vaccine, as, a, public, health, intervention, fractional, dose, vaccination, reduces, the, dose, of, a, vaccine, to, allow, more, individuals, to, be, vaccinated, with, a, given, vaccine, stock, trading, societal, benefit, for, individual, protection, based, on, the, nonlinearity, properties, of, many, vaccines, it, is, effective, in, poverty, diseases, and, promises, benefits, in, pandemic, waves, e, g, in, covid, 19, when, vaccine, supply, is, limited, allegations, of, vaccine, injuries, in, recent, decades, have, appeared, in, litigation, in, the, u, s, some, families, have, won, substantial, awards, from, sympathetic, juries, even, though, most, public, health, officials, have, said, that, the, claims, of, injuries, were, unfounded, in, response, several, vaccine, makers, stopped, production, which, the, us, government, believed, could, be, a, threat, to, public, health, so, laws, were, passed, to, shield, manufacturers, from, liabilities, stemming, from, vaccine, injury, claims, the, safety, and, side, effects, of, multiple, vaccines, have, been, tested, to, uphold, the, viability, of, vaccines, as, a, barrier, against, disease, the, influenza, vaccine, was, tested, in, controlled, trials, and, proven, to, have, negligible, side, effects, equal, to, that, of, a, placebo, some, concerns, from, families, might, have, arisen, from, social, beliefs, and, norms, that, cause, them, to, mistrust, or, refuse, vaccinations, contributing, to, this, discrepancy, in, side, effects, that, were, unfounded, opposition, to, vaccination, from, a, wide, array, of, vaccine, critics, has, existed, since, the, earliest, vaccination, campaigns, it, is, widely, accepted, that, the, benefits, of, preventing, serious, illness, and, death, from, infectious, diseases, greatly, outweigh, the, risks, of, rare, serious, adverse, effects, following, immunization, some, studies, have, claimed, to, show, that, current, vaccine, schedules, increase, infant, mortality, and, hospitalization, rates, those, studies, however, are, correlational, in, nature, and, therefore, cannot, demonstrate, causal, effects, and, the, studies, have, also, been, criticized, for, cherry, picking, the, comparisons, they, report, for, ignoring, historical, trends, that, support, an, opposing, conclusion, and, for, counting, vaccines, in, a, manner, that, is, completely, arbitrary, and, riddled, with, mistakes, various, disputes, have, arisen, over, the, morality, ethics, effectiveness, and, safety, of, vaccination, some, vaccination, critics, say, that, vaccines, are, ineffective, against, disease, or, that, vaccine, safety, studies, are, inadequate, some, religious, groups, do, not, allow, vaccination, and, some, political, groups, oppose, mandatory, vaccination, on, the, grounds, of, individual, liberty, in, response, concern, has, been, raised, that, spreading, unfounded, information, about, the, medical, risks, of, vaccines, increases, rates, of, life, threatening, infections, not, only, in, the, children, whose, parents, refused, vaccinations, but, also, in, those, who, cannot, be, vaccinated, due, to, age, or, immunodeficiency, who, could, contract, infections, from, unvaccinated, carriers, see, herd, immunity, some, parents, believe, vaccinations, cause, autism, although, there, is, no, scientific, evidence, to, support, this, idea, in, 2011, andrew, wakefield, a, leading, proponent, of, the, theory, that, mmr, vaccine, causes, autism, was, found, to, have, been, financially, motivated, to, falsify, research, data, and, was, subsequently, stripped, of, his, medical, license, in, the, united, states, people, who, refuse, vaccines, for, non, medical, reasons, have, made, up, a, large, percentage, of, the, cases, of, measles, and, subsequent, cases, of, permanent, hearing, loss, and, death, caused, by, the, disease, many, parents, do, not, vaccinate, their, children, because, they, feel, that, diseases, are, no, longer, present, due, to, vaccination, this, is, a, false, assumption, since, diseases, held, in, check, by, immunization, programs, can, and, do, still, return, if, immunization, is, dropped, these, pathogens, could, possibly, infect, vaccinated, people, due, to, the, pathogen, s, ability, to, mutate, when, it, is, able, to, live, in, unvaccinated, hosts, the, notion, of, a, connection, between, vaccines, and, autism, originated, in, a, 1998, paper, published, in, the, lancet, whose, lead, author, was, the, physician, andrew, wakefield, his, study, concluded, that, eight, of, the, 12, patients, ages, 3, years, to, 10, years, developed, behavioral, symptoms, consistent, with, autism, following, the, mmr, vaccine, an, immunization, against, measles, mumps, and, rubella, the, article, was, widely, criticized, for, lack, of, scientific, rigor, and, it, was, proven, that, wakefield, falsified, data, in, the, article, in, 2004, 10, of, the, original, 12, co, authors, not, including, wakefield, published, a, retraction, of, the, article, and, stated, the, following, we, wish, to, make, it, clear, that, in, this, paper, no, causal, link, was, established, between, mmr, vaccine, and, autism, as, the, data, were, insufficient, in, 2010, the, lancet, officially, retracted, the, article, stating, that, several, elements, of, the, article, were, incorrect, including, falsified, data, and, protocols, the, article, has, sparked, a, much, greater, anti, vaccination, movement, particularly, in, the, united, states, and, even, though, the, article, was, shown, to, be, fraudulent, and, was, heavily, retracted, one, in, four, parents, still, believe, that, vaccines, can, cause, autism, to, date, all, validated, and, definitive, studies, have, shown, that, there, is, no, correlation, between, vaccines, and, autism, one, of, the, studies, published, in, 2015, confirms, there, is, no, link, between, autism, and, the, mmr, vaccine, infants, were, given, a, health, plan, that, included, an, mmr, vaccine, and, were, continuously, studied, until, they, reached, five, years, old, there, was, no, link, between, the, vaccine, and, children, who, had, a, normally, developed, sibling, or, a, sibling, that, had, autism, making, them, a, higher, risk, for, developing, autism, themselves, it, can, be, difficult, to, correct, the, memory, of, humans, when, wrong, information, is, received, prior, to, correct, information, even, though, there, is, much, evidence, to, go, against, the, wakefield, study, and, retractions, were, published, by, most, of, the, co, authors, many, people, continue, to, believe, and, base, decisions, on, the, study, as, it, still, lingers, in, their, memory, studies, and, research, are, being, conducted, to, determine, effective, ways, to, correct, misinformation, in, the, public, memory, a, vaccine, administration, may, be, oral, by, injection, intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous, by, puncture, transdermal, or, intranasal, several, recent, clinical, trials, have, aimed, to, deliver, the, vaccines, via, mucosal, surfaces, to, be, up, taken, by, the, common, mucosal, immunity, system, thus, avoiding, the, need, for, injections, health, is, often, used, as, one, of, the, metrics, for, determining, the, economic, prosperity, of, a, country, this, is, because, healthier, individuals, are, generally, better, suited, to, contributing, to, the, economic, development, of, a, country, than, the, sick, there, are, many, reasons, for, this, for, instance, a, person, who, is, vaccinated, for, influenza, not, only, protects, themselves, from, the, risk, of, influenza, but, simultaneously, also, prevents, themselves, from, infecting, those, around, them, this, leads, to, a, healthier, society, which, allows, individuals, to, be, more, economically, productive, children, are, consequently, able, to, attend, school, more, often, and, have, been, shown, to, do, better, academically, similarly, adults, are, able, to, work, more, often, more, efficiently, and, more, effectively, on, the, whole, vaccinations, induce, a, net, benefit, to, society, vaccines, are, often, noted, for, their, high, return, on, investment, roi, values, especially, when, considering, the, long, term, effects, some, vaccines, have, much, higher, roi, values, than, others, studies, have, shown, that, the, ratios, of, vaccination, benefits, to, costs, can, differ, substantially, from, 27, 1, for, diphtheria, pertussis, to, 13, 5, 1, for, measles, 4, 76, 1, for, varicella, and, 0, 68, 1, 1, 1, for, pneumococcal, conjugate, some, governments, choose, to, subsidize, the, costs, of, vaccines, due, to, some, of, the, high, roi, values, attributed, to, vaccinations, the, united, states, subsidizes, over, half, of, all, vaccines, for, children, which, costs, between, 400, and, 600, each, although, most, children, do, get, vaccinated, the, adult, population, of, the, us, is, still, below, the, recommended, immunization, levels, many, factors, can, be, attributed, to, this, issue, many, adults, who, have, other, health, conditions, are, unable, to, be, safely, immunized, whereas, others, opt, not, to, be, immunized, for, the, sake, of, private, financial, benefits, many, americans, are, underinsured, and, as, such, are, required, to, pay, for, vaccines, out, of, pocket, others, are, responsible, for, paying, high, deductibles, and, co, pays, although, vaccinations, usually, induce, long, term, economic, benefits, many, governments, struggle, to, pay, the, high, short, term, costs, associated, with, labor, and, production, consequently, many, countries, neglect, to, provide, such, services, according, to, a, 2021, paper, vaccinations, against, haemophilus, influenzae, type, b, hepatitis, b, human, papillomavirus, japanese, encephalitis, measles, neisseria, meningitidis, serogroup, a, rotavirus, rubella, streptococcus, pneumoniae, and, yellow, fever, have, prevented, an, estimated, 50, million, deaths, from, 2000, to, 2019, the, paper, represents, the, largest, assessment, of, vaccine, impact, before, covid, 19, related, disruptions, according, to, a, june, 2022, study, covid, 19, vaccinations, prevented, an, additional, 14, 4, to, 19, 8, million, deaths, in, 185, countries, and, territories, from, 8, december, 2020, to, 8, december, 2021, they, estimated, that, it, would, cost, between, 2, 8, billion, and, 3, 7, billion, to, develop, at, least, one, vaccine, for, each, of, them, this, should, be, set, against, the, potential, cost, of, an, outbreak, the, 2003, sars, outbreak, in, east, asia, cost, 54, billion, game, theory, uses, utility, functions, to, model, costs, and, benefits, which, may, include, financial, and, non, financial, costs, and, benefits, in, recent, years, it, has, been, argued, that, game, theory, can, effectively, be, used, to, model, vaccine, uptake, in, societies, researchers, have, used, game, theory, for, this, purpose, to, analyse, vaccination, uptake, in, the, context, of, diseases, such, as, influenza, and, measles
