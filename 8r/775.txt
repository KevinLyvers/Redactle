alternate, taxonomy, the, bovidae, comprise, the, biological, family, of, cloven, hoofed, ruminant, mammals, that, includes, cattle, yaks, bison, buffalo, antelopes, including, goat, antelopes, sheep, and, goats, a, member, of, this, family, is, called, a, bovid, with, 143, extant, species, and, 300, known, extinct, species, the, family, bovidae, consists, of, 11, or, two, major, subfamilies, and, thirteen, major, tribes, the, family, evolved, 20, million, years, ago, in, the, early, miocene, the, bovids, show, great, variation, in, size, and, pelage, colouration, except, some, domesticated, forms, all, male, bovids, have, two, or, more, horns, and, in, many, species, females, possess, horns, too, the, size, and, shape, of, the, horns, vary, greatly, but, the, basic, structure, is, always, one, or, more, pairs, of, simple, bony, protrusions, without, branches, often, having, a, spiral, twisted, or, fluted, form, each, covered, in, a, permanent, sheath, of, keratin, most, bovids, bear, 30, to, 32, teeth, most, bovids, are, diurnal, social, activity, and, feeding, usually, peak, during, dawn, and, dusk, bovids, typically, rest, before, dawn, during, midday, and, after, dark, they, have, various, methods, of, social, organisation, and, social, behaviour, which, are, classified, into, solitary, and, gregarious, behaviour, bovids, use, different, forms, of, vocal, olfactory, and, tangible, communication, most, species, alternately, feed, and, ruminate, throughout, the, day, while, small, bovids, forage, in, dense, and, closed, habitat, larger, species, feed, on, high, fiber, vegetation, in, open, grasslands, most, bovids, are, polygynous, mature, bovids, mate, at, least, once, a, year, and, smaller, species, may, even, mate, twice, in, some, species, neonate, bovids, remain, hidden, for, a, week, to, two, months, regularly, nursed, by, their, mothers, in, other, species, neonates, are, followers, accompanying, their, dams, rather, than, tending, to, remain, hidden, the, greatest, diversities, of, bovids, occur, in, africa, the, maximum, concentration, of, species, is, in, the, savannas, of, eastern, africa, other, bovid, species, also, occur, in, europe, asia, and, north, america, bovidae, includes, three, of, the, five, domesticated, mammals, whose, use, has, spread, outside, their, original, ranges, namely, cattle, sheep, and, goats, dairy, products, such, as, milk, butter, and, cheese, are, manufactured, largely, from, domestic, cattle, bovids, are, also, raised, for, their, leather, meat, and, wool, the, name, bovidae, was, given, by, the, british, zoologist, john, edward, gray, in, 1821, the, word, bovidae, is, the, combination, of, the, prefix, bov, originating, from, latin, bos, ox, through, late, latin, bovinus, and, the, suffix, idae, the, family, bovidae, is, placed, in, the, order, artiodactyla, which, includes, the, even, toed, ungulates, it, includes, 143, extant, species, accounting, for, nearly, 55, of, the, ungulates, and, 300, known, extinct, species, until, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, it, was, understood, that, the, family, moschidae, musk, deer, was, sister, to, cervidae, however, a, 2003, phylogenetic, study, by, alexandre, hassanin, of, national, museum, of, natural, history, france, and, colleagues, based, on, mitochondrial, and, nuclear, analyses, revealed, that, moschidae, and, bovidae, form, a, clade, sister, to, cervidae, according, to, the, study, cervidae, diverged, from, the, bovidae, moschidae, clade, 27, to, 28, million, years, ago, the, following, cladogram, is, based, on, the, 2003, study, tragulidae, antilocapridae, giraffidae, cervidae, moschidae, bovidae, molecular, studies, have, supported, monophyly, in, the, family, bovidae, a, group, of, organisms, comprises, an, ancestral, species, and, all, their, descendants, the, number, of, subfamilies, in, bovidae, is, disputed, with, suggestions, of, as, many, as, ten, and, as, few, as, two, subfamilies, however, molecular, morphological, and, fossil, evidence, indicates, the, existence, of, eight, distinct, subfamilies, aepycerotinae, consisting, of, just, the, impala, alcelaphinae, bontebok, hartebeest, wildebeest, and, relatives, antilopinae, several, antelopes, gazelles, and, relatives, bovinae, cattle, buffaloes, bison, and, other, antelopes, caprinae, goats, sheep, ibex, serows, and, relatives, cephalophinae, duikers, hippotraginae, addax, oryx, and, relatives, and, reduncinae, reedbuck, and, kob, antelopes, in, addition, three, extinct, subfamilies, are, known, hypsodontinae, mid, miocene, oiocerinae, turolian, and, the, subfamily, tethytraginae, which, contains, tethytragus, mid, miocene, in, 1992, alan, w, gentry, of, the, natural, history, museum, london, divided, the, eight, major, subfamilies, of, bovidae, into, two, major, clades, on, the, basis, of, their, evolutionary, history, the, boodontia, which, comprised, only, the, bovinae, and, the, aegodontia, which, consisted, of, the, rest, of, the, subfamilies, boodonts, have, somewhat, primitive, teeth, resembling, those, of, oxen, whereas, aegodonts, have, more, advanced, teeth, like, those, of, goats, a, controversy, exists, about, the, recognition, of, peleinae, and, pantholopinae, comprising, the, genera, pelea, and, pantholops, respectively, as, subfamilies, in, 2000, american, biologist, george, schaller, and, palaeontologist, elisabeth, vrba, suggested, the, inclusion, of, pelea, in, reduncinae, though, the, grey, rhebok, the, sole, species, of, pelea, is, highly, different, from, kobs, and, reduncines, in, morphology, pantholops, earlier, classified, in, the, antilopinae, was, later, placed, in, its, own, subfamily, pantholopinae, however, molecular, and, morphological, analysis, supports, the, inclusion, of, pantholops, in, caprinae, below, is, a, cladogram, based, on, yang, et, al, 2013, and, calamari, 2021, bovini, bison, buffalo, cattle, etc, boselaphini, nilgai, and, four, horned, antelope, tragelaphini, kudus, nyalas, etc, aepycerotinae, impala, nesotraginae, suni, and, bates, s, antelope, antilopinae, gazelles, springbok, dik, dik, royal, antelope, saiga, etc, cephalophinae, duikers, etc, oreotraginae, klipspringer, reduncinae, kobs, reedbucks, waterbucks, etc, caprinae, chamois, sheep, ibexes, goats, muskox, etc, alcelaphinae, hartebeest, topi, wildebeest, etc, hippotraginae, sable, antelopes, oryxes, etc, alternatively, all, members, of, the, aegodontia, can, be, classified, within, the, subfamily, antilopinae, with, the, individual, subfamilies, being, tribes, in, this, treatment, in, the, early, miocene, bovids, began, diverging, from, the, cervids, deer, and, giraffids, the, earliest, bovids, whose, presence, in, africa, and, eurasia, in, the, latter, part, of, early, miocene, 20, mya, has, been, ascertained, were, small, animals, somewhat, similar, to, modern, gazelles, and, probably, lived, in, woodland, environments, eotragus, the, earliest, known, bovid, weighed, 18, kg, 40, lb, and, was, nearly, the, same, in, size, as, the, thomson, s, gazelle, early, in, their, evolutionary, history, the, bovids, split, into, two, main, clades, boodontia, of, eurasian, origin, and, aegodontia, of, african, origin, this, early, split, between, boodontia, and, aegodontia, has, been, attributed, to, the, continental, divide, between, these, land, masses, when, these, continents, were, later, rejoined, this, barrier, was, removed, and, both, groups, expanded, into, the, territory, of, the, other, the, tribes, bovini, and, tragelaphini, diverged, in, the, early, miocene, bovids, are, known, to, have, reached, the, americas, in, the, pleistocene, by, crossing, the, bering, land, bridge, the, present, genera, of, alcelaphinae, appeared, in, the, pliocene, the, extinct, alcelaphine, genus, paramularius, which, was, the, same, in, size, as, the, hartebeest, is, believed, to, have, come, into, being, in, the, pliocene, but, became, extinct, in, the, middle, pleistocene, several, genera, of, hippotraginae, are, known, since, the, pliocene, and, pleistocene, this, subfamily, appears, to, have, diverged, from, the, alcelaphinae, in, the, latter, part, of, early, miocene, the, bovinae, are, believed, to, have, diverged, from, the, rest, of, the, bovidae, in, the, early, miocene, the, boselaphini, became, extinct, in, africa, in, the, early, pliocene, their, latest, fossils, were, excavated, in, langebaanweg, south, africa, and, lothagam, kenya, the, middle, miocene, marked, the, spread, of, the, bovids, into, china, and, the, indian, subcontinent, according, to, vrba, the, radiation, of, the, subfamily, alcelaphinae, began, in, the, latter, part, of, middle, miocene, the, caprinae, tribes, probably, diverged, in, the, early, middle, miocene, the, caprini, emerged, in, the, middle, miocene, and, seem, to, have, been, replaced, by, other, bovids, and, cervids, in, eurasia, the, earliest, fossils, of, the, antilopines, are, from, the, middle, miocene, though, studies, show, the, existence, of, the, subfamily, from, the, early, miocene, speciation, occurred, in, the, tribe, antilopini, during, the, middle, or, upper, miocene, mainly, in, eurasia, tribe, neotragini, seems, to, have, appeared, in, africa, by, the, end, of, miocene, and, had, become, widespread, by, the, pliocene, by, the, late, miocene, around, 10, mya, the, bovids, rapidly, diversified, leading, to, the, creation, of, 70, new, genera, this, late, miocene, radiation, was, partly, because, many, bovids, became, adapted, to, more, open, grassland, habitats, the, aepycerotinae, first, appeared, in, the, late, miocene, and, no, significant, difference, in, the, sizes, of, the, primitive, and, modern, impala, has, been, noted, fossils, of, ovibovines, a, tribe, of, caprinae, in, africa, date, back, to, the, late, miocene, the, earliest, hippotragine, fossils, date, back, to, the, late, miocene, and, were, excavated, from, sites, such, as, lothagam, and, awash, valley, the, first, african, fossils, of, reduncinae, date, back, to, 6, 7, mya, reduncinae, and, peleinae, probably, diverged, in, the, mid, miocene, all, bovids, have, the, similar, basic, form, a, snout, with, a, blunt, end, one, or, more, pairs, of, horns, generally, present, on, males, immediately, after, the, oval, or, pointed, ears, a, distinct, neck, and, limbs, and, a, tail, varying, in, length, and, bushiness, among, the, species, most, bovids, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, with, males, usually, larger, as, well, as, heavier, than, females, sexual, dimorphism, is, more, prominent, in, medium, to, large, sized, bovids, all, bovids, have, four, toes, on, each, foot, they, walk, on, the, central, two, the, hooves, while, the, outer, two, the, dewclaws, are, much, smaller, and, rarely, touch, the, ground, the, bovids, show, great, variation, in, size, the, gaur, can, weigh, more, than, 1, 500, kg, 3, 300, lb, and, stand, 2, 2, m, 87, in, high, at, the, shoulder, the, royal, antelope, in, sharp, contrast, is, only, 25, cm, 9, 8, in, tall, and, weighs, at, most, 3, kg, 6, 6, lb, the, klipspringer, another, small, antelope, stands, 45, 60, cm, 18, 24, in, at, the, shoulder, and, weighs, just, 10, 20, kg, 22, 44, lb, differences, occur, in, pelage, colouration, ranging, from, a, pale, white, as, in, the, arabian, oryx, to, black, as, in, the, black, wildebeest, however, only, the, intermediate, shades, such, as, brown, and, reddish, brown, as, in, the, reedbuck, are, commonly, observed, in, several, species, females, and, juveniles, exhibit, a, light, coloured, coat, while, those, of, males, darken, with, age, as, in, the, wildebeest, the, coat, may, be, marked, with, prominent, or, faint, stripes, in, some, species, such, as, the, addax, the, coat, colour, can, vary, by, the, season, scent, glands, and, sebaceous, glands, are, often, present, some, species, such, as, the, gemsbok, sable, antelope, and, grant, s, gazelle, are, camouflaged, with, strongly, disruptive, facial, markings, that, conceal, the, highly, recognisable, eye, many, species, such, as, gazelles, may, be, made, to, look, flat, and, hence, to, blend, into, the, background, by, countershading, the, outlines, of, many, bovids, are, broken, up, with, bold, disruptive, colouration, the, strongly, contrasting, patterns, helping, to, delay, recognition, by, predators, however, all, the, hippotraginae, including, the, gemsbok, have, pale, bodies, and, faces, with, conspicuous, markings, the, zoologist, tim, caro, describes, this, as, difficult, to, explain, but, given, that, the, species, are, diurnal, he, suggests, that, the, markings, may, function, in, communication, strongly, contrasting, leg, colouration, is, common, only, in, the, bovidae, where, for, example, bos, ovis, bontebok, and, gemsbok, have, white, stockings, again, communication, is, the, likely, function, excepting, some, domesticated, forms, all, male, bovids, have, horns, and, in, many, species, females, too, possess, horns, the, size, and, shape, of, the, horns, vary, greatly, but, the, basic, structure, is, a, pair, of, simple, bony, protrusions, without, branches, often, having, a, spiral, twisted, or, fluted, form, each, covered, in, a, permanent, sheath, of, keratin, although, horns, occur, in, a, single, pair, on, almost, all, bovid, species, there, are, exceptions, such, as, the, four, horned, antelope, and, the, jacob, sheep, the, unique, horn, structure, is, the, only, unambiguous, morphological, feature, of, bovids, that, distinguishes, them, from, other, pecorans, a, high, correlation, exists, between, horn, morphology, and, fighting, behaviour, of, the, individual, for, instance, long, horns, are, intended, for, wrestling, and, fencing, whereas, curved, horns, are, used, in, ramming, males, with, horns, directed, inwards, are, monogamous, and, solitary, while, those, with, horns, directed, outwards, tend, to, be, polygynous, these, results, were, independent, of, body, size, male, horn, development, has, been, linked, to, sexual, selection, horns, are, small, spikes, in, the, monogamous, duikers, and, other, small, antelopes, whereas, in, the, polygynous, they, are, large, and, elaborately, formed, for, example, in, a, spiral, structure, as, in, the, giant, eland, thus, to, some, extent, horns, depict, the, degree, of, competition, among, males, in, a, species, however, the, presence, of, horns, in, females, is, likely, due, to, natural, selection, the, horns, of, females, are, usually, smaller, than, those, of, males, and, are, sometimes, of, a, different, shape, the, horns, of, female, bovids, are, believed, to, have, evolved, for, defence, against, predators, or, to, express, territoriality, as, nonterritorial, females, which, are, able, to, use, crypsis, for, predator, defence, often, do, not, have, horns, females, possess, horns, only, in, half, of, the, bovid, genera, and, females, in, these, genera, are, heavier, than, those, in, the, rest, females, use, horns, mainly, for, stabbing, in, bovids, the, third, and, fourth, metapodials, are, combined, into, the, cannon, bone, the, ulna, and, fibula, are, reduced, and, fused, with, the, radius, and, tibia, respectively, long, scapulae, are, present, whereas, the, clavicles, are, absent, being, ruminants, the, stomach, is, composed, of, four, chambers, the, rumen, 80, the, omasum, the, reticulum, and, the, abomasum, the, ciliates, and, bacteria, of, the, rumen, ferment, the, complex, cellulose, into, simpler, fatty, acids, which, are, then, absorbed, through, the, rumen, wall, bovids, have, a, long, small, intestine, the, length, of, the, small, intestine, in, cattle, is, 29, 49, m, 95, 161, ft, body, temperature, fluctuates, through, the, day, for, instance, in, goats, the, temperature, can, change, slightly, from, nearly, 37, c, 99, f, in, the, early, morning, to, 40, c, 104, f, in, the, afternoon, temperature, is, regulated, through, sweating, in, cattle, whereas, goats, use, panting, for, the, same, the, right, lung, consisting, of, four, to, five, lobes, is, around, 1, 5, times, larger, than, the, left, which, has, three, lobes, most, bovids, bear, 30, to, 32, teeth, while, the, upper, incisors, are, absent, the, upper, canines, are, either, reduced, or, absent, instead, of, the, upper, incisors, bovids, have, a, thick, and, tough, layer, of, tissue, called, the, dental, pad, that, provides, a, surface, to, grip, grasses, and, foliage, they, are, hypsodont, and, selenodont, since, the, molars, and, premolars, are, low, crowned, and, crescent, shaped, cusps, the, lower, incisors, and, canines, project, forward, the, incisors, are, followed, by, a, long, toothless, gap, known, as, the, diastema, the, general, dental, formula, for, bovids, is, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, most, members, of, the, family, are, herbivorous, but, most, duikers, are, omnivorous, like, other, ruminants, bovids, have, four, chambered, stomachs, which, allow, them, to, digest, plant, material, such, as, grass, that, cannot, be, used, by, many, other, animals, ruminants, and, some, others, like, kangaroos, rabbits, and, termites, are, able, to, use, micro, organisms, living, in, their, guts, to, break, down, cellulose, by, fermentation, the, bovids, have, various, methods, of, social, organisation, and, social, behaviour, which, are, classified, into, solitary, and, gregarious, behaviour, further, these, types, may, each, be, divided, into, territorial, and, nonterritorial, behaviour, small, bovids, such, as, the, klipspringer, oribi, and, steenbok, are, generally, solitary, and, territorial, they, hold, small, territories, into, which, other, members, of, the, species, are, not, allowed, to, enter, these, antelopes, form, monogamous, pairs, many, species, such, as, the, dik, dik, use, pheromone, secretions, from, the, preorbital, glands, and, sometimes, dung, as, well, to, mark, their, territories, the, offspring, disperse, at, the, time, of, adolescence, and, males, must, acquire, territories, prior, to, mating, the, bushbuck, is, the, only, bovid, that, is, both, solitary, and, not, territorial, this, antelope, hardly, displays, aggression, and, tends, to, isolate, itself, or, form, loose, herds, though, in, a, favourable, habitat, several, bushbuck, may, be, found, quite, close, to, one, another, excluding, the, cephalophines, duikers, tragelaphines, spiral, horned, antelopes, and, the, neotragines, most, african, bovids, are, gregarious, and, territorial, males, are, forced, to, disperse, on, attaining, sexual, maturity, and, must, form, their, own, territories, while, females, are, not, required, to, do, so, males, that, do, not, hold, territories, form, bachelor, herds, competition, takes, place, among, males, to, acquire, dominance, and, fights, tend, to, be, more, rigorous, in, limited, rutting, seasons, with, the, exception, of, migratory, males, males, generally, hold, the, same, territory, throughout, their, lives, in, the, waterbuck, some, male, individuals, known, as, satellite, males, may, be, allowed, into, the, territories, of, other, males, and, have, to, wait, till, the, owner, grows, old, so, they, may, acquire, his, territory, lek, mating, where, males, gather, together, and, competitively, display, to, potential, mates, is, known, to, exist, among, topis, kobs, and, lechwes, the, tragelaphines, cattle, sheep, and, goats, are, gregarious, and, not, territorial, in, these, species, males, must, gain, absolute, dominance, over, all, other, males, and, fights, are, not, confined, to, territories, males, therefore, spend, years, in, body, growth, most, bovids, are, diurnal, although, a, few, such, as, the, buffalo, bushbuck, reedbuck, and, grysbok, are, exceptions, social, activity, and, feeding, usually, peak, during, dawn, and, dusk, the, bovids, usually, rest, before, dawn, during, midday, and, after, dark, grooming, is, usually, by, licking, with, the, tongue, rarely, do, antelopes, roll, in, mud, or, dust, wildebeest, and, buffalo, usually, wallow, in, mud, whereas, the, hartebeest, and, topi, rub, their, heads, and, horns, in, mud, and, then, smear, it, over, their, bodies, bovids, use, different, forms, of, vocal, olfactory, and, tangible, communication, these, involve, varied, postures, of, neck, head, horns, hair, legs, and, ears, to, convey, sexual, excitement, emotional, state, or, alarm, one, such, expression, is, the, flehmen, response, bovids, usually, stand, motionless, with, the, head, high, and, an, intent, stare, when, they, sense, danger, some, like, the, impala, kudu, and, eland, can, even, leap, to, heights, of, a, few, feet, bovids, may, roar, or, grunt, to, caution, others, and, warn, off, predators, bovids, such, as, gazelles, stot, or, pronk, in, response, to, predators, making, high, leaps, on, stiff, legs, indicating, honestly, both, that, the, predator, has, been, seen, and, that, the, stotting, individual, is, strong, and, not, worth, chasing, in, the, mating, season, rutting, males, bellow, to, make, their, presence, known, to, females, muskoxen, roar, during, male, male, fights, and, male, saigas, force, air, through, their, noses, producing, a, roar, to, deter, rival, males, and, attract, females, mothers, also, use, vocal, communication, to, locate, their, calves, if, they, get, separated, during, fights, over, dominance, males, tend, to, display, themselves, in, an, erect, posture, with, a, level, muzzle, fighting, techniques, differ, amongst, the, bovid, families, and, also, depend, on, their, build, while, the, hartebeest, fight, on, knees, others, usually, fight, on, all, fours, gazelles, of, various, sizes, use, different, methods, of, combat, gazelles, usually, box, and, in, serious, fights, may, clash, and, fence, consisting, of, hard, blows, from, short, range, ibex, goat, and, sheep, males, stand, upright, and, clash, into, each, other, downwards, wildebeest, use, powerful, head, butting, in, aggressive, clashes, if, horns, become, entangled, the, opponents, move, in, a, circular, manner, to, unlock, them, muskoxen, will, ram, into, each, other, at, high, speeds, as, a, rule, only, two, bovids, of, equal, build, and, level, of, defence, engage, in, a, fight, which, is, intended, to, determine, the, superior, of, the, two, individuals, that, are, evidently, inferior, to, others, would, rather, flee, than, fight, for, example, immature, males, do, not, fight, with, the, mature, bulls, generally, bovids, direct, their, attacks, on, the, opponent, s, head, rather, than, its, body, the, s, shaped, horns, such, as, those, on, the, impala, have, various, sections, that, help, in, ramming, holding, and, stabbing, serious, fights, leading, to, injury, are, rare, most, bovids, alternately, feed, and, ruminate, throughout, the, day, while, those, that, feed, on, concentrate, feed, and, digest, in, short, intervals, the, roughage, feeders, take, longer, intervals, only, small, species, such, as, the, duiker, browse, for, a, few, hours, during, day, or, night, feeding, habits, are, related, to, body, size, while, small, bovids, forage, in, dense, and, closed, habitat, larger, species, feed, upon, high, fiber, vegetation, in, open, grasslands, subfamilies, exhibit, different, feeding, strategies, while, bovinae, species, graze, extensively, on, fresh, grass, and, diffused, forage, cephalophinae, species, with, the, exception, of, sylvicapra, primarily, consume, fruits, reduncinae, and, hippotraginae, species, depend, on, unstable, food, sources, but, the, latter, are, specially, adapted, to, arid, areas, members, of, caprinae, being, flexible, feeders, forage, even, in, areas, with, low, productivity, tribes, alcelaphini, hippotragini, and, reduncini, have, high, proportions, of, monocots, in, their, diets, on, the, contrary, tragelaphini, and, neotragini, with, the, exception, of, ourebia, feed, extensively, on, dicots, no, conspicuous, relationship, exists, between, body, size, and, consumption, of, monocots, most, bovids, are, polygynous, in, a, few, species, individuals, are, monogamous, resulting, in, minimal, male, male, aggression, and, reduced, selection, for, large, body, size, in, males, thus, sexual, dimorphism, is, almost, absent, females, may, be, slightly, larger, than, males, possibly, due, to, competition, among, females, for, the, acquisition, of, territories, this, is, the, case, in, duikers, and, other, small, bovids, the, time, taken, for, the, attainment, of, sexual, maturity, by, either, sex, varies, broadly, among, bovids, sexual, maturity, may, even, precede, or, follow, mating, for, instance, the, impala, males, though, sexually, mature, by, a, year, can, mate, only, after, four, years, of, age, on, the, contrary, barbary, sheep, females, may, give, birth, to, offspring, even, before, they, have, gained, sexual, maturity, the, delay, in, male, sexual, maturation, is, more, visible, in, sexually, dimorphic, species, particularly, the, reduncines, probably, due, to, competition, among, males, for, instance, the, blue, wildebeest, females, become, capable, of, reproduction, within, a, year, or, two, of, birth, while, the, males, become, mature, only, when, four, years, old, all, bovids, mate, at, least, once, a, year, and, smaller, species, may, even, mate, twice, mating, seasons, occur, typically, during, the, rainy, months, for, most, bovids, as, such, breeding, might, peak, twice, in, the, equatorial, regions, the, sheep, and, goats, exhibit, remarkable, seasonality, of, reproduction, in, the, determination, of, which, the, annual, cycle, of, daily, photoperiod, plays, a, pivotal, role, other, factors, that, have, a, significant, influence, on, this, cycle, include, the, temperature, of, the, surroundings, nutritional, status, social, interactions, the, date, of, parturition, and, the, lactation, period, a, study, of, this, phenomenon, concluded, that, goats, and, sheep, are, short, day, breeders, mating, in, most, sheep, breeds, begins, in, summer, or, early, autumn, mating, in, sheep, is, also, affected, by, melatonin, that, advances, the, onset, of, the, breeding, season, and, thyroxine, that, terminates, the, breeding, season, estrus, lasts, for, at, most, a, day, in, bovids, with, the, exception, of, bovines, and, tragelaphines, except, for, the, hartebeest, and, the, topi, all, bovids, can, detect, estrus, in, females, by, testing, the, urine, using, the, vomeronasal, organ, once, the, male, is, assured, that, the, female, is, in, estrus, he, begins, courtship, displays, these, displays, vary, greatly, from, the, elaborate, marches, among, gregarious, species, to, the, fervent, licking, of, female, genitalia, among, solitary, species, females, initially, not, receptive, ultimately, mates, with, the, male, which, has, achieved, dominance, over, others, receptiveness, is, expressed, by, permission, for, mounting, by, the, male, and, setting, aside, the, tail, by, the, female, copulation, generally, takes, a, few, seconds, gestational, period, varies, among, bovids, while, duiker, gestation, ranges, from, 120, to, 150, days, gestation, in, african, buffalo, ranges, from, 300, to, 330, days, usually, a, single, offspring, is, born, twins, are, less, frequent, and, it, is, able, to, stand, and, run, by, itself, within, an, hour, of, birth, in, monogamous, species, males, assist, in, defending, their, young, but, that, is, not, the, case, in, polygynous, species, most, newborn, calves, remain, hidden, for, a, week, to, two, months, regularly, nursed, by, their, mothers, in, some, bovid, species, the, neonates, start, following, about, their, mothers, immediately, or, within, a, few, days, as, in, the, impala, different, bovids, have, different, strategies, for, the, defence, of, juveniles, for, instance, while, wildebeest, mothers, solely, defend, their, young, buffaloes, exhibit, collective, defence, weaning, might, occur, as, early, as, two, months, as, in, royal, antelope, or, as, late, as, a, year, as, in, muskox, most, wild, bovids, live, for, 10, to, 15, years, larger, species, tend, to, live, longer, for, instance, american, bison, can, live, up, to, 25, years, and, gaur, up, to, 30, years, the, mean, lifespan, of, domesticated, individuals, is, nearly, ten, years, for, example, domesticated, goats, have, an, average, lifespan, of, 12, years, usually, males, mainly, in, polygynous, species, have, shorter, lifespans, than, females, this, can, be, attributed, to, several, reasons, early, dispersal, of, young, males, aggressive, male, male, fights, vulnerability, to, predation, particularly, when, males, are, less, agile, as, in, kudu, and, malnutrition, being, large, in, size, the, male, body, has, high, nutritional, requirements, which, may, not, be, satisfied, richard, despard, estes, suggested, that, females, mimic, male, secondary, sexual, characteristics, like, horns, to, protect, their, male, offspring, from, dominant, males, this, feature, seems, to, have, been, strongly, selected, to, prevent, male, mortality, and, imbalanced, sex, ratios, due, to, attacks, by, aggressive, males, and, forced, dispersal, of, young, males, during, adolescence, most, of, the, diverse, bovid, species, occur, in, africa, the, maximum, concentration, is, in, the, savannas, of, eastern, africa, depending, on, their, feeding, habits, several, species, have, radiated, over, large, stretches, of, land, and, hence, several, variations, in, dental, and, limb, morphology, are, observed, duikers, inhabit, the, equatorial, rainforests, sitatunga, and, lechwe, occur, near, swamps, eland, inhabit, grasslands, springbok, and, oryx, occur, in, deserts, bongo, and, anoa, live, in, dense, forests, and, mountain, goats, and, takin, live, at, high, altitudes, a, few, bovid, species, also, occur, in, europe, asia, and, north, america, sheep, and, goats, are, found, primarily, in, eurasia, though, the, barbary, sheep, and, the, ibex, form, part, of, the, african, fauna, the, muskox, is, confined, to, the, arctic, tundra, several, bovid, species, have, been, domesticated, by, human, beings, the, domestication, of, goats, and, sheep, began, 10, thousand, years, ago, while, cattle, were, domesticated, about, 7, 5, thousand, years, ago, the, domestication, of, bovids, has, contributed, to, shifting, the, dependence, of, human, beings, from, hunting, and, gathering, to, agriculture, the, bovidae, includes, three, of, the, six, large, domesticated, herbivores, whose, use, has, spread, outside, their, original, ranges, namely, cattle, sheep, and, goats, all, are, from, eurasia, and, are, now, found, across, the, world, the, other, three, species, are, the, horse, donkey, and, pig, other, large, bovids, that, have, been, domesticated, but, which, remain, within, the, ranges, of, their, wild, ancestors, are, the, domestic, buffalo, from, the, wild, water, buffalo, domestic, yak, from, the, wild, yak, zebu, from, the, indian, aurochs, gayal, from, the, gaur, and, bali, cattle, from, the, banteng, some, antelopes, have, been, domesticated, including, the, oryxes, addax, elands, and, the, extinct, bubal, hartebeest, in, ancient, egypt, oryxes, addaxes, and, bubal, hartebeests, are, depicted, in, carved, walls, the, earliest, evidence, of, cattle, domestication, is, from, 8000, bc, suggesting, that, the, process, began, in, cyprus, and, the, euphrates, basin, dairy, products, such, as, milk, butter, ghee, yoghurt, buttermilk, and, cheese, are, manufactured, largely, from, domestic, cattle, though, the, milk, of, sheep, goat, yak, and, buffalo, is, also, used, in, some, parts, of, the, world, and, for, gourmet, products, for, example, buffalo, milk, is, used, to, make, mozzarella, in, italy, and, gulab, jamun, dessert, in, india, while, sheep, milk, is, used, to, make, blue, roquefort, cheese, in, france, beef, is, a, food, source, high, in, zinc, selenium, phosphorus, iron, and, b, vitamins, bison, meat, is, lower, in, fat, and, cholesterol, than, beef, but, has, a, higher, protein, content, bovid, leather, is, tough, and, durable, with, the, additional, advantage, that, it, can, be, made, into, leathers, of, varying, thicknesses, from, soft, clothing, leather, to, hard, shoe, leather, while, goat, and, cattle, leather, have, a, wide, variety, of, use, sheepskin, is, suited, only, for, clothing, purposes, wool, from, merino, hoggets, is, the, finest, and, most, valuable, merino, wool, is, 3, 5, in, 7, 6, 12, 7, cm, long, and, very, soft, coarse, wools, being, durable, and, resistant, to, pilling, are, used, for, making, tough, garments, and, carpets, bone, meal, is, an, important, fertilizer, rich, in, calcium, phosphorus, and, nitrogen, effective, in, removing, soil, acidity, bovid, horns, have, been, used, as, drinking, vessels, since, antiquity, bovidae, have, featured, in, stories, since, at, least, the, time, of, aesop, s, fables, from, ancient, greece, around, 600, bc, fables, by, aesop, include, the, crow, and, the, sheep, the, frog, and, the, ox, and, the, wolf, and, the, lamb, the, mythological, creature, chimera, depicted, as, a, lion, with, the, head, of, a, goat, arising, from, its, back, and, a, tail, that, might, end, with, a, snake, s, head, was, one, of, the, offspring, of, typhon, and, echidna, and, a, sibling, of, such, monsters, as, cerberus, and, the, lernaean, hydra, the, sheep, synonymous, with, the, goat, in, chinese, mythology, is, the, eighth, animal, of, the, chinese, zodiac, and, a, symbol, of, filial, piety
