horse, flies, and, deer, flies, are, true, flies, in, the, family, tabanidae, in, the, insect, order, diptera, the, adults, are, often, large, and, agile, in, flight, only, female, horseflies, bite, land, vertebrates, including, humans, to, obtain, blood, they, prefer, to, fly, in, sunlight, avoiding, dark, and, shady, areas, and, are, inactive, at, night, they, are, found, all, over, the, world, except, for, some, islands, and, the, polar, regions, hawaii, greenland, iceland, both, horse, flies, and, botflies, oestridae, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, gadflies, adult, horse, flies, feed, on, nectar, and, plant, exudates, males, have, weak, mouthparts, but, females, have, mouthparts, strong, enough, to, bite, large, animals, this, is, for, the, purpose, of, obtaining, enough, protein, from, blood, to, produce, eggs, the, mouthparts, of, females, are, formed, into, a, stout, stabbing, organ, with, two, pairs, of, sharp, cutting, blades, and, a, spongelike, part, used, to, lap, up, the, blood, that, flows, from, the, wound, the, larvae, are, predaceous, and, grow, in, semiaquatic, habitats, female, horse, flies, can, transfer, blood, borne, diseases, from, one, animal, to, another, through, their, feeding, habit, in, areas, where, diseases, occur, they, have, been, known, to, carry, equine, infectious, anaemia, virus, some, trypanosomes, the, filarial, worm, loa, loa, anthrax, among, cattle, and, sheep, and, tularemia, they, can, reduce, growth, rates, in, cattle, and, lower, the, milk, output, of, cows, if, suitable, shelters, are, not, provided, horse, flies, have, appeared, in, literature, ever, since, aeschylus, in, ancient, greece, mentioned, them, driving, people, to, madness, through, their, persistent, pursuit, tabanidae, are, known, by, a, large, number, of, common, names, the, subfamily, chrysopsinae, is, known, as, deer, flies, perhaps, because, of, their, abundance, on, moorland, where, deer, roam, and, buffalo, flies, moose, flies, and, elephant, flies, emanate, from, other, parts, of, the, world, where, these, animals, are, found, the, term, horse, fly, refers, primarily, to, tabaninae, that, are, typically, larger, and, stouter, and, that, lack, the, banded, wings, deer, flies, have, other, common, names, include, tabanids, gadflies, green, headed, flies, and, green, flies, the, word, tabanus, was, first, recorded, by, pliny, the, younger, and, has, survived, as, the, generic, name, in, general, country, folk, did, not, distinguish, between, the, various, biting, insects, that, irritated, their, cattle, and, called, them, all, gad, flies, from, the, word, gad, meaning, spike, other, common, names, include, cleg, gleg, or, clag, which, come, from, old, norse, and, may, have, originated, from, the, vikings, other, names, such, as, stouts, refer, to, the, wide, bodies, of, the, insects, and, dun, flies, to, their, sombre, colouring, in, australia, and, the, uk, they, are, also, known, as, march, flies, a, name, used, in, other, anglophonic, countries, to, refer, to, the, non, bloodsucking, bibionidae, adult, tabanids, are, large, flies, with, prominent, compound, eyes, short, antennae, composed, of, three, segments, and, wide, bodies, in, females, the, eyes, are, widely, separated, in, males, however, they, are, almost, touching, the, eyes, are, often, patterned, and, brightly, coloured, in, living, tabanids, but, appear, dull, in, preserved, specimens, the, terminal, segment, of, the, antennae, is, pointed, and, annulated, appearing, to, be, composed, of, several, tapering, rings, there, are, no, hairs, or, arista, stemming, from, the, antennae, both, the, head, and, thorax, are, clad, in, short, hairs, but, no, bristles, are, on, the, body, the, membranous, forewings, are, clear, either, shaded, uniformly, grey, or, brown, or, patterned, in, some, species, they, have, a, basal, lobe, or, calypter, that, covers, the, modified, knob, like, hindwings, or, halteres, the, tips, of, the, legs, have, two, lobes, on, the, sides, pulvilli, and, a, central, lobe, empodium, in, addition, to, two, claws, that, enable, them, to, grip, to, surfaces, species, recognition, is, based, on, details, of, head, structures, antennae, frons, and, maxillae, wing, venation, and, body, patterning, minute, variations, of, surface, structure, cause, subtle, alterations, of, the, overlying, hairs, which, alters, the, appearance, of, the, body, tabanid, species, range, from, medium, sized, to, very, large, robust, insects, most, have, a, body, length, between, 5, and, 25, mm, 0, 2, and, 1, 0, in, with, the, largest, having, a, wingspan, of, 60, mm, 2, 4, in, deer, flies, in, the, genus, chrysops, are, up, to, 10, mm, 0, 4, in, long, have, yellow, to, black, bodies, and, striped, abdomens, and, membranous, wings, with, dark, patches, horse, flies, genus, tabanus, are, larger, up, to, 25, mm, 1, in, in, length, and, are, mostly, dark, brown, or, black, with, dark, eyes, often, with, a, metallic, sheen, yellow, flies, genus, diachlorus, are, similar, in, shape, to, deer, flies, but, have, yellowish, bodies, and, the, eyes, are, purplish, black, with, a, green, sheen, some, species, in, the, subfamily, pangoniinae, have, an, exceptionally, long, proboscis, tubular, mouthpart, the, larvae, are, long, and, cylindrical, or, spindle, shaped, with, small, heads, and, 12, body, segments, they, have, rings, of, tubercles, warty, outgrowths, known, as, pseudopods, around, the, segments, and, also, bands, of, short, setae, bristles, the, posterior, tip, of, each, larva, has, a, breathing, siphon, and, a, bulbous, area, known, as, graber, s, organ, the, outlines, of, the, adult, insect, s, head, and, wings, are, visible, through, the, pupa, which, has, seven, moveable, abdominal, segments, all, except, the, front, one, of, which, bears, a, band, of, setae, the, posterior, end, of, the, pupa, bears, a, group, of, spine, like, tubercles, some, species, such, as, deer, flies, and, the, australian, march, flies, are, known, for, being, extremely, noisy, during, flight, though, clegs, for, example, fly, quietly, and, bite, with, little, warning, tabanids, are, agile, fliers, hybomitra, species, have, been, observed, to, perform, aerial, manoeuvres, similar, to, those, performed, by, fighter, jets, such, as, the, immelmann, turn, horseflies, can, lay, claim, to, being, the, fastest, flying, insects, the, male, hybomitra, hinei, wrighti, has, been, recorded, reaching, speeds, of, up, to, 145, kilometres, per, hour, 90, mph, when, pursuing, a, female, tabanids, are, found, worldwide, except, for, the, polar, regions, but, they, are, absent, from, some, islands, such, as, greenland, iceland, and, hawaii, the, genera, tabanus, chrysops, and, haematopota, all, occur, in, temperate, subtropical, and, tropical, locations, but, haematopota, is, absent, from, australia, and, south, america, they, mostly, occur, in, warm, areas, with, suitable, moist, locations, for, breeding, but, also, occupy, a, wide, range, of, habitats, from, deserts, to, alpine, meadows, they, are, found, from, sea, level, to, at, least, 3, 300, m, 10, 800, ft, the, oldest, records, of, the, family, come, from, the, early, cretaceous, with, the, oldest, record, being, eotabanoid, known, from, wings, found, in, the, berriasian, 145, 140, million, years, ago, purbeck, group, of, england, although, the, bloodsucking, habit, is, associated, with, a, long, proboscis, a, fossil, insect, that, has, elongated, mouthparts, is, not, necessarily, a, bloodsucker, as, it, may, instead, have, fed, on, nectar, the, ancestral, tabanids, may, have, co, evolved, with, the, angiosperm, plants, on, which, they, fed, with, a, necessity, for, high, protein, food, for, egg, production, the, diet, of, early, tabanomorphs, was, probably, predatory, and, from, this, the, bloodsucking, habit, may, have, evolved, in, the, santana, formation, in, brazil, no, mammals, have, been, found, so, the, fossil, tabanids, found, there, likely, fed, on, reptiles, cold, bloodsucking, probably, preceded, warm, bloodsucking, but, some, dinosaurs, are, postulated, to, have, been, warm, blooded, and, may, have, been, early, hosts, for, the, horse, flies, the, tabanidae, are, true, flies, and, members, of, the, insect, order, diptera, with, the, families, athericidae, pelecorhynchidae, and, oreoleptidae, tabanidae, are, classified, in, the, superfamily, tabanoidea, along, with, the, rhagionoidea, this, superfamily, makes, up, the, infraorder, tabanomorpha, tabanoid, families, seem, to, be, united, by, the, presence, of, a, venom, canal, in, the, mandible, of, the, larvae, worldwide, about, 4, 455, species, of, tabanidae, have, been, described, over, 1, 300, of, them, in, the, genus, tabanus, tabanid, identification, is, based, mostly, on, adult, morphological, characters, of, the, head, wing, venation, and, sometimes, the, last, abdominal, segment, the, genitalia, are, very, simple, and, do, not, provide, clear, species, differentiation, as, in, many, other, insect, groups, in, the, past, most, taxonomic, treatments, considered, the, family, to, be, composed, of, three, subfamilies, pangoniinae, tribes, pangoniini, philolichini, scionini, chrysopsinae, tribes, bouvieromyiini, chrysopsini, rhinomyzini, and, tabaninae, tribes, diachlorini, haematopotini, tabanini, some, treatments, increased, this, to, five, subfamilies, adding, the, subfamily, adersiinae, with, the, single, genus, adersia, and, the, subfamily, scepcidinae, with, the, two, genera, braunsiomyia, and, scepsis, a, 2015, study, by, morita, et, al, using, nucleotide, data, aimed, to, clarify, the, phylogeny, of, the, tabanidae, and, supports, three, subfamilies, the, subfamilies, pangoniinae, and, tabaninae, were, shown, to, be, monophyletic, the, tribes, philolichini, chrysopsini, rhinomyzini, and, haematopotini, were, found, to, be, monophyletic, with, the, scionini, also, being, monophyletic, apart, from, the, difficult, to, place, genus, goniops, adersia, was, recovered, within, the, pangoniini, as, were, the, genera, previously, placed, in, the, scepcidinae, and, mycteromyia, and, goniops, were, recovered, within, the, chrysopsini, the, tabaninae, lack, ocelli, simple, eyes, and, have, no, spurs, on, the, tips, of, their, hind, tibiae, in, the, pangoniinae, ocelli, are, present, and, the, antennal, flagellum, whip, like, structure, usually, has, eight, annuli, or, rings, in, the, chrysopsinae, the, antennal, flagellum, has, a, basal, plate, and, the, flagellum, has, four, annuli, females, have, a, shining, callus, on, the, frons, front, of, the, head, between, the, eyes, the, adersiinae, have, a, divided, tergite, on, the, ninth, abdominal, segment, and, the, scepsidinae, have, highly, reduced, mouthparts, members, of, the, family, pelecorhynchidae, were, initially, included, in, the, tabanidae, and, moved, into, the, rhagionidae, before, being, elevated, into, a, separate, family, the, infraorder, tabanomorpha, shares, the, blood, feeding, habit, as, a, common, primitive, characteristic, although, this, is, restricted, to, the, female, two, well, known, genera, are, the, common, horse, flies, tabanus, named, by, swedish, taxonomist, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, and, the, deer, flies, chrysops, named, by, the, german, entomologist, johann, wilhelm, meigen, in, 1802, meigen, did, pioneering, research, on, flies, and, was, the, author, of, die, fliegen, the, flies, he, gave, the, name, haematopota, meaning, blood, drinker, to, another, common, genus, of, horse, flies, adult, tabanids, feed, on, nectar, and, plant, exudates, and, some, are, important, pollinators, of, certain, specialised, flowers, several, south, african, and, asian, species, in, the, pangoniinae, have, spectacularly, long, probosces, adapted, for, the, extraction, of, nectar, from, flowers, with, long, narrow, corolla, tubes, such, as, lapeirousia, and, certain, pelargonium, both, males, and, females, engage, in, nectar, feeding, but, females, of, most, species, are, anautogenous, meaning, they, require, a, blood, meal, before, they, are, able, to, reproduce, effectively, to, obtain, the, blood, the, females, but, not, the, males, bite, animals, including, humans, the, female, needs, about, six, days, to, fully, digest, her, blood, meal, and, after, that, she, needs, to, find, another, host, the, flies, seem, to, be, attracted, to, a, potential, victim, by, its, movement, warmth, and, surface, texture, and, by, the, carbon, dioxide, it, breathes, out, the, flies, mainly, choose, large, mammals, such, as, cattle, horses, camels, and, deer, but, few, are, species, specific, they, have, also, been, observed, feeding, on, smaller, mammals, birds, lizards, and, turtles, and, even, on, animals, that, have, recently, died, unlike, many, biting, insects, such, as, mosquitoes, whose, biting, mechanism, and, saliva, allow, a, bite, not, noticed, by, the, host, at, the, time, bites, from, tabanids, are, immediately, irritating, to, the, victim, so, that, they, are, often, brushed, off, and, may, have, to, visit, multiple, hosts, to, obtain, sufficient, blood, this, behaviour, means, that, they, may, carry, disease, causing, organisms, from, one, host, to, another, large, animals, and, livestock, are, generally, powerless, to, dislodge, the, fly, so, there, is, no, selective, advantage, for, the, flies, to, evolve, a, less, immediately, painful, bite, the, mouthparts, of, females, are, of, the, usual, dipteran, form, and, consist, of, a, bundle, of, six, chitinous, stylets, that, together, with, a, fold, of, the, fleshy, labium, form, the, proboscis, on, either, side, of, these, are, two, maxillary, palps, when, the, insect, lands, on, an, animal, it, grips, the, surface, with, its, clawed, feet, the, labium, is, retracted, the, head, is, thrust, downwards, and, the, stylets, slice, into, the, flesh, some, of, these, have, sawing, edges, and, muscles, can, move, them, from, side, to, side, to, enlarge, the, wound, saliva, containing, anticoagulant, is, injected, into, the, wound, to, prevent, clotting, the, blood, that, flows, from, the, wound, is, lapped, up, by, another, mouthpart, which, functions, as, a, sponge, bites, can, be, painful, for, a, day, or, more, fly, saliva, may, provoke, allergic, reactions, such, as, hives, and, difficulty, with, breathing, tabanid, bites, can, make, life, outdoors, unpleasant, for, humans, and, can, reduce, milk, output, in, cattle, they, are, attracted, by, polarized, reflections, from, water, making, them, a, particular, nuisance, near, swimming, pools, since, tabanids, prefer, to, be, in, sunshine, they, normally, avoid, shaded, places, such, as, barns, and, are, inactive, at, night, attack, patterns, vary, with, species, clegs, fly, silently, and, prefer, to, bite, humans, on, the, wrist, or, bare, leg, large, species, of, tabanus, buzz, loudly, fly, low, and, bite, ankles, legs, or, backs, of, knees, chrysops, flies, somewhat, higher, bites, the, back, of, the, neck, and, has, a, high, buzzing, note, the, striped, hides, of, zebras, may, have, evolved, to, reduce, their, attractiveness, to, horse, flies, and, tsetse, flies, the, closer, together, the, stripes, the, fewer, flies, are, visually, attracted, the, zebra, s, legs, have, particularly, fine, striping, and, this, is, the, shaded, part, of, the, body, that, is, most, likely, to, be, bitten, in, other, unstriped, equids, more, recent, research, by, the, same, lead, author, shows, that, the, stripes, were, no, less, attractive, to, tabanids, but, they, merely, touched, and, could, not, make, a, controlled, landing, to, bite, this, suggests, that, a, function, of, the, stripes, was, interfering, with, optic, flow, this, does, not, preclude, the, possible, use, of, stripes, for, other, purposes, such, as, signaling, or, camouflage, another, disruptive, mechanism, may, also, be, in, play, however, a, study, comparing, horse, fly, behaviour, when, approaching, horses, wearing, either, striped, or, check, patterned, rugs, when, compared, with, plain, rugs, found, that, both, patterns, were, equally, effective, in, deterring, the, insects, mating, often, occurs, in, swarms, generally, at, landmarks, such, as, hilltops, the, season, time, of, day, and, type, of, landmark, used, for, mating, swarms, are, specific, to, particular, species, eggs, are, laid, on, stones, or, vegetation, near, water, in, clusters, of, up, to, 1000, especially, on, emergent, water, plants, the, eggs, are, white, at, first, but, darken, with, age, they, hatch, after, about, six, days, with, the, emerging, larvae, using, a, special, hatching, spike, to, open, the, egg, case, the, larvae, fall, into, the, water, or, onto, the, moist, ground, below, chrysops, species, develop, in, particularly, wet, locations, while, tabanus, species, prefer, drier, places, the, larvae, are, legless, grubs, tapering, at, both, ends, they, have, small, heads, and, 11, or, 13, segments, and, moult, six, to, 13, times, over, the, course, of, a, year, or, more, in, temperate, species, the, larvae, have, a, quiescent, period, during, winter, diapause, while, tropical, species, breed, several, times, a, year, in, the, majority, of, species, they, are, white, but, in, some, they, are, greenish, or, brownish, and, they, often, have, dark, bands, on, each, segment, a, respiratory, siphon, at, the, hind, end, allows, the, larvae, to, obtain, air, when, submerged, in, water, larvae, of, nearly, all, species, are, carnivorous, often, cannibalistic, in, captivity, and, consume, worms, insect, larvae, and, arthropods, the, larvae, may, be, parasitized, by, nematodes, flies, of, the, families, bombyliidae, and, tachinidae, and, hymenoptera, in, the, family, pteromalidae, when, fully, developed, the, larvae, move, into, drier, soil, near, the, surface, of, the, ground, to, pupate, in, dry, places, a, remarkable, adaptation, was, discovered, in, the, 1920s, by, w, a, lamborn, in, malawi, then, nyasaland, the, larvae, were, discovered, to, tunnel, in, a, spiral, motion, while, the, mud, was, still, wet, and, plastic, forming, a, partitioned, cylinder, in, the, center, of, which, the, larva, settled, to, pupate, after, closing, the, entrance, this, adaption, protects, the, pupae, against, mudcracks, when, the, mud, dries, up, as, a, spreading, crack, would, change, direction, when, it, hit, the, wall, of, the, cylinder, the, pupae, are, brown, and, glossy, rounded, at, the, head, end, and, tapering, at, the, other, end, wing, and, limb, buds, can, be, seen, and, each, abdominal, segment, is, fringed, with, short, spines, after, about, two, weeks, metamorphosis, is, complete, the, pupal, case, splits, along, the, thorax, and, the, adult, fly, emerges, males, usually, appear, first, but, when, both, sexes, have, emerged, mating, takes, place, courtship, starting, in, the, air, and, finishing, on, the, ground, the, female, needs, to, feed, on, blood, before, depositing, her, egg, mass, eggs, are, often, attacked, by, tiny, parasitic, wasps, and, the, larvae, are, consumed, by, birds, as, well, as, being, paratised, by, tachinid, flies, fungi, and, nematodes, adults, are, eaten, by, generalized, predators, such, as, birds, and, some, specialist, predators, such, as, the, horse, guard, wasp, a, bembicinid, wasp, also, preferentially, attack, horse, flies, catching, them, to, provision, their, nests, tabanids, are, known, vectors, for, some, blood, borne, bacterial, viral, protozoan, and, worm, diseases, of, mammals, such, as, the, equine, infectious, anaemia, virus, and, various, species, of, trypanosoma, which, cause, diseases, in, animals, and, humans, species, of, the, genus, chrysops, transmit, the, parasitic, filarial, worm, loa, loa, between, humans, and, tabanids, are, known, to, transmit, anthrax, among, cattle, and, sheep, and, tularemia, between, rabbits, and, humans, blood, loss, is, a, common, problem, in, some, animals, when, large, flies, are, abundant, some, animals, have, been, known, to, lose, up, to, 300, ml, 11, imp, fl, oz, 10, us, fl, oz, of, blood, in, a, single, day, to, tabanid, flies, a, loss, which, can, weaken, or, even, kill, them, anecdotal, reports, of, bites, leading, to, fatal, anaphylaxis, in, humans, have, been, made, an, extremely, rare, occurrence, control, of, tabanid, flies, is, difficult, malaise, traps, are, most, often, used, to, capture, them, and, these, can, be, modified, with, the, use, of, baits, and, attractants, that, include, carbon, dioxide, or, octenol, a, dark, shiny, ball, suspended, below, them, that, moves, in, the, breeze, can, also, attract, them, and, forms, a, key, part, of, a, modified, manitoba, trap, that, is, used, most, often, for, trapping, and, sampling, the, tabanidae, cattle, can, be, treated, with, pour, on, pyrethroids, which, may, repel, the, flies, and, fitting, them, with, insecticide, impregnated, eartags, or, collars, has, had, some, success, in, killing, the, insects, tabanid, bites, can, be, painful, to, humans, usually, a, weal, raised, area, of, skin, occurs, around, the, site, other, symptoms, may, include, urticaria, a, rash, dizziness, weakness, wheezing, and, angioedema, a, temporary, itchy, pink, or, red, swelling, occurring, around, the, eyes, or, lips, a, few, people, experience, an, allergic, reaction, the, national, health, service, of, the, united, kingdom, recommends, that, the, site, of, the, bite, should, be, washed, and, a, cold, compress, applied, scratching, the, wound, should, be, avoided, at, all, times, and, an, antihistamine, preparation, can, be, applied, in, most, cases, the, symptoms, subside, within, a, few, hours, but, if, the, wound, becomes, infected, medical, advice, should, be, sought, in,
