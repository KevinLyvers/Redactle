arachnids, are, arthropods, in, the, class, arachnida, r, k, n, d, of, the, subphylum, chelicerata, arachnida, includes, among, others, spiders, scorpions, ticks, mites, pseudoscorpions, harvestmen, camel, spiders, whip, spiders, and, vinegaroons, adult, arachnids, have, eight, legs, attached, to, the, cephalothorax, in, some, species, the, frontmost, pair, of, legs, has, converted, to, a, sensory, function, while, in, others, different, appendages, can, grow, large, enough, to, take, on, the, appearance, of, extra, pairs, of, legs, almost, all, extant, arachnids, are, terrestrial, living, mainly, on, land, however, some, inhabit, freshwater, environments, and, with, the, exception, of, the, pelagic, zone, marine, environments, as, well, they, comprise, over, 110, 000, named, species, of, which, 51, 000, are, species, of, spiders, the, term, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, ar, chn, spider, from, the, myth, of, the, hubristic, human, weaver, arachne, who, was, turned, into, a, spider, almost, all, adult, arachnids, have, eight, legs, unlike, adult, insects, which, all, have, six, legs, however, arachnids, also, have, two, further, pairs, of, appendages, that, have, become, adapted, for, feeding, defense, and, sensory, perception, the, first, pair, the, chelicerae, serve, in, feeding, and, defense, the, next, pair, the, pedipalps, have, been, adapted, for, feeding, locomotion, and, or, reproductive, functions, in, scorpions, pseudoscorpions, and, ricinuleids, the, pedipalps, end, in, a, pair, of, pinchers, while, in, whip, scorpions, schizomida, amblypygi, and, most, harvestmen, they, are, raptorial, and, used, for, prey, capture, in, solifugae, the, palps, are, quite, leg, like, so, that, these, animals, appear, to, have, ten, legs, the, larvae, of, mites, and, ricinulei, have, only, six, legs, a, fourth, pair, usually, appears, when, they, moult, into, nymphs, however, mites, are, variable, as, well, as, eight, there, are, adult, mites, with, six, or, like, in, eriophyoidea, even, four, legs, while, the, adult, males, in, some, members, of, podapolipidae, have, six, legs, the, adult, females, have, only, a, single, pair, arachnids, are, further, distinguished, from, insects, by, the, fact, they, do, not, have, antennae, or, wings, their, body, is, organized, into, two, tagmata, called, the, prosoma, and, opisthosoma, also, referred, to, as, the, cephalothorax, and, abdomen, however, there, are, questions, about, the, validity, of, the, latter, terms, while, the, term, cephalothorax, implies, a, fused, cephalon, head, and, thorax, there, is, currently, neither, fossil, nor, embryological, evidence, that, arachnids, ever, had, a, separate, thorax, like, division, likewise, the, abdomen, of, many, arachnids, contains, organs, atypical, of, an, abdomen, such, as, a, heart, and, respiratory, organs, the, cephalothorax, is, usually, covered, by, a, single, unsegmented, carapace, the, abdomen, is, segmented, in, the, more, primitive, forms, but, varying, degrees, of, fusion, between, the, segments, occur, in, many, groups, it, is, typically, divided, into, a, preabdomen, and, postabdomen, although, this, is, only, clearly, visible, in, scorpions, and, in, some, orders, such, as, the, mites, the, abdominal, sections, are, completely, fused, a, telson, is, present, in, scorpions, where, it, has, been, modified, to, a, stinger, and, into, a, flagellum, in, the, palpigradi, schizomida, very, short, and, whip, scorpions, at, the, base, of, the, flagellum, in, the, two, latter, groups, there, are, glands, which, produce, acetic, acid, as, a, chemical, defense, except, for, a, pair, of, pectines, in, scorpions, and, the, spinnerets, in, spiders, the, abdomen, has, no, appendages, like, all, arthropods, arachnids, have, an, exoskeleton, and, they, also, have, an, internal, structure, of, cartilage, like, tissue, called, the, endosternite, to, which, certain, muscle, groups, are, attached, the, endosternite, is, even, calcified, in, some, opiliones, most, arachnids, lack, extensor, muscles, in, the, distal, joints, of, their, appendages, spiders, and, whip, scorpions, extend, their, limbs, hydraulically, using, the, pressure, of, their, hemolymph, solifuges, and, some, harvestmen, extend, their, knees, by, the, use, of, highly, elastic, thickenings, in, the, joint, cuticle, scorpions, pseudoscorpions, and, some, harvestmen, have, evolved, muscles, that, extend, two, leg, joints, the, femur, patella, and, patella, tibia, joints, at, once, the, equivalent, joints, of, the, pedipalps, of, scorpions, though, are, extended, by, elastic, recoil, there, are, characteristics, that, are, particularly, important, for, the, terrestrial, lifestyle, of, arachnids, such, as, internal, respiratory, surfaces, in, the, form, of, tracheae, or, modification, of, the, book, gill, into, a, book, lung, an, internal, series, of, vascular, lamellae, used, for, gas, exchange, with, the, air, while, the, tracheae, are, often, individual, systems, of, tubes, similar, to, those, in, insects, ricinuleids, pseudoscorpions, and, some, spiders, possess, sieve, tracheae, in, which, several, tubes, arise, in, a, bundle, from, a, small, chamber, connected, to, the, spiracle, this, type, of, tracheal, system, has, almost, certainly, evolved, from, the, book, lungs, and, indicates, that, the, tracheae, of, arachnids, are, not, homologous, with, those, of, insects, further, adaptations, to, terrestrial, life, are, appendages, modified, for, more, efficient, locomotion, on, land, internal, fertilisation, special, sensory, organs, and, water, conservation, enhanced, by, efficient, excretory, structures, as, well, as, a, waxy, layer, covering, the, cuticle, the, excretory, glands, of, arachnids, include, up, to, four, pairs, of, coxal, glands, along, the, side, of, the, prosoma, and, one, or, two, pairs, of, malpighian, tubules, emptying, into, the, gut, many, arachnids, have, only, one, or, the, other, type, of, excretory, gland, although, several, do, have, both, the, primary, nitrogenous, waste, product, in, arachnids, is, guanine, arachnid, blood, is, variable, in, composition, depending, on, the, mode, of, respiration, arachnids, with, an, efficient, tracheal, system, do, not, need, to, transport, oxygen, in, the, blood, and, may, have, a, reduced, circulatory, system, in, scorpions, and, some, spiders, however, the, blood, contains, haemocyanin, a, copper, based, pigment, with, a, similar, function, to, haemoglobin, in, vertebrates, the, heart, is, located, in, the, forward, part, of, the, abdomen, and, may, or, may, not, be, segmented, some, mites, have, no, heart, at, all, arachnids, are, mostly, carnivorous, feeding, on, the, pre, digested, bodies, of, insects, and, other, small, animals, but, ticks, and, many, mites, are, parasites, some, of, which, are, carriers, of, disease, the, diet, of, mites, also, include, tiny, animals, fungi, plant, juices, and, decomposing, matter, almost, as, varied, is, the, diet, of, harvestmen, where, we, will, find, predators, decomposers, and, omnivores, feeding, on, decaying, plant, and, animal, matter, droppings, animals, and, mushrooms, the, harvestmen, and, some, mites, such, as, the, house, dust, mite, are, also, the, only, arachnids, able, to, ingest, solid, food, which, exposes, them, to, internal, parasites, although, it, is, not, unusual, for, spiders, to, eat, their, own, silk, and, one, species, of, spider, is, mostly, herbivorous, scorpions, spiders, and, pseudoscorpions, secrete, venom, from, specialized, glands, to, kill, prey, or, defend, themselves, their, venom, also, contains, pre, digestive, enzymes, that, helps, breaking, down, the, prey, the, saliva, of, ticks, contains, anticoagulants, and, anticomplements, and, several, species, produce, a, neurotoxin, arachnids, produce, digestive, enzymes, in, their, stomachs, and, use, their, pedipalps, and, chelicerae, to, pour, them, over, their, dead, prey, the, digestive, juices, rapidly, turn, the, prey, into, a, broth, of, nutrients, which, the, arachnid, sucks, into, a, pre, buccal, cavity, located, immediately, in, front, of, the, mouth, behind, the, mouth, is, a, muscular, sclerotised, pharynx, which, acts, as, a, pump, sucking, the, food, through, the, mouth, and, on, into, the, oesophagus, and, stomach, in, some, arachnids, the, oesophagus, also, acts, as, an, additional, pump, the, stomach, is, tubular, in, shape, with, multiple, diverticula, extending, throughout, the, body, the, stomach, and, its, diverticula, both, produce, digestive, enzymes, and, absorb, nutrients, from, the, food, it, extends, through, most, of, the, body, and, connects, to, a, short, sclerotised, intestine, and, anus, in, the, hind, part, of, the, abdomen, arachnids, have, two, kinds, of, eyes, the, lateral, and, median, ocelli, the, lateral, ocelli, evolved, from, compound, eyes, and, may, have, a, tapetum, which, enhances, the, ability, to, collect, light, with, the, exception, of, scorpions, which, can, have, up, to, five, pairs, of, lateral, ocelli, there, are, never, more, than, three, pairs, present, the, median, ocelli, develop, from, a, transverse, fold, of, the, ectoderm, the, ancestors, of, modern, arachnids, probably, had, both, types, but, modern, ones, often, lack, one, type, or, the, other, the, cornea, of, the, eye, also, acts, as, a, lens, and, is, continuous, with, the, cuticle, of, the, body, beneath, this, is, a, transparent, vitreous, body, and, then, the, retina, and, if, present, the, tapetum, in, most, arachnids, the, retina, probably, does, not, have, enough, light, sensitive, cells, to, allow, the, eyes, to, form, a, proper, image, in, addition, to, the, eyes, almost, all, arachnids, have, two, other, types, of, sensory, organs, the, most, important, to, most, arachnids, are, the, fine, sensory, hairs, that, cover, the, body, and, give, the, animal, its, sense, of, touch, these, can, be, relatively, simple, but, many, arachnids, also, possess, more, complex, structures, called, trichobothria, finally, slit, sense, organs, are, slit, like, pits, covered, with, a, thin, membrane, inside, the, pit, a, small, hair, touches, the, underside, of, the, membrane, and, detects, its, motion, slit, sense, organs, are, believed, to, be, involved, in, proprioception, and, possibly, also, hearing, arachnids, may, have, one, or, two, gonads, which, are, located, in, the, abdomen, the, genital, opening, is, usually, located, on, the, underside, of, the, second, abdominal, segment, in, most, species, the, male, transfers, sperm, to, the, female, in, a, package, or, spermatophore, the, males, in, harvestmen, and, some, mites, have, a, penis, complex, courtship, rituals, have, evolved, in, many, arachnids, to, ensure, the, safe, delivery, of, the, sperm, to, the, female, members, of, many, orders, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, arachnids, usually, lay, yolky, eggs, which, hatch, into, immatures, that, resemble, adults, scorpions, however, are, either, ovoviviparous, or, viviparous, depending, on, species, and, bear, live, young, also, some, mites, are, ovoviviparous, and, viviparous, even, if, most, lay, eggs, in, most, arachnids, only, the, females, provide, parental, care, with, harvestmen, being, one, of, the, few, exceptions, the, phylogenetic, relationships, among, the, main, subdivisions, of, arthropods, have, been, the, subject, of, considerable, research, and, dispute, for, many, years, a, consensus, emerged, from, about, 2010, onwards, based, on, both, morphological, and, molecular, evidence, extant, living, arthropods, are, a, monophyletic, group, and, are, divided, into, three, main, clades, chelicerates, including, arachnids, pancrustaceans, the, paraphyletic, crustaceans, plus, insects, and, their, allies, and, myriapods, centipedes, millipedes, and, allies, the, three, groups, are, related, as, shown, in, the, cladogram, below, including, fossil, taxa, does, not, fundamentally, alter, this, view, although, it, introduces, some, additional, basal, groups, chelicerata, sea, spiders, horseshoe, crabs, and, arachnids, myriapoda, centipedes, millipedes, and, allies, pancrustacea, crustaceans, and, hexapods, the, extant, chelicerates, comprise, two, marine, groups, sea, spiders, and, horseshoe, crabs, and, the, terrestrial, arachnids, these, have, been, thought, to, be, related, as, shown, below, pycnogonida, sea, spiders, may, be, excluded, from, the, chelicerates, which, are, then, identified, as, the, group, labelled, euchelicerata, a, 2019, analysis, nests, xiphosura, deeply, within, arachnida, pycnogonida, sea, spiders, xiphosura, horseshoe, crabs, arachnida, discovering, relationships, within, the, arachnids, has, proven, difficult, as, of, march, 2016, with, successive, studies, producing, different, results, a, study, in, 2014, based, on, the, largest, set, of, molecular, data, to, date, concluded, that, there, were, systematic, conflicts, in, the, phylogenetic, information, particularly, affecting, the, orders, acariformes, parasitiformes, and, pseudoscorpiones, which, have, had, much, faster, evolutionary, rates, analyses, of, the, data, using, sets, of, genes, with, different, evolutionary, rates, produced, mutually, incompatible, phylogenetic, trees, the, authors, favoured, relationships, shown, by, more, slowly, evolving, genes, which, demonstrated, the, monophyly, of, chelicerata, euchelicerata, and, arachnida, as, well, as, of, some, clades, within, the, arachnids, the, diagram, below, summarizes, their, conclusions, based, largely, on, the, 200, most, slowly, evolving, genes, dashed, lines, represent, uncertain, placements, acariformes, opiliones, ricinulei, solifugae, parasitiformes, pseudoscorpiones, scorpiones, araneae, amblypygi, uropygi, thelyphonida, s, s, tetrapulmonata, here, consisting, of, araneae, amblypygi, and, uropygi, thelyphonida, s, s, schizomida, was, not, included, in, the, study, received, strong, support, somewhat, unexpectedly, there, was, support, for, a, clade, comprising, opiliones, ricinulei, and, solifugae, a, combination, not, found, in, most, other, studies, in, early, 2019, a, molecular, phylogenetic, analysis, placed, the, horseshoe, crabs, xiphosura, as, the, sister, group, to, ricinulei, it, also, grouped, pseudoscorpions, with, mites, and, ticks, which, the, authors, considered, may, be, due, to, long, branch, attraction, the, addition, of, scorpiones, to, produce, a, clade, called, arachnopulmonata, was, also, well, supported, pseudoscorpiones, may, also, belong, here, as, all, six, orders, share, the, same, ancient, whole, genome, duplication, and, analyses, support, pseudoscorpions, as, the, sister, group, of, scorpions, genetic, analysis, has, not, yet, been, done, for, ricinulei, palpigradi, or, solifugae, but, horseshoe, crabs, have, gone, through, two, whole, genome, duplications, which, gives, them, five, hox, clusters, with, 34, hox, genes, the, highest, number, found, in, any, invertebrate, yet, it, is, not, clear, if, the, oldest, genome, duplication, is, related, to, the, one, in, arachnopulmonata, onychophora, mandibulata, pycnogonida, chasmataspidida, eurypterida, parasitiformes, acariformes, pseudoscorpiones, opiliones, palpigradi, solifugae, ricinulei, xiphosura, scorpiones, trigonotarbida, araneae, uraraneida, haptopoda, amblypygi, schizomida, uropygi, more, recent, phylogenomic, analyses, that, have, densely, sampled, both, genomic, datasets, and, morphology, have, supported, horseshoe, crabs, as, nested, inside, arachnida, suggesting, a, complex, history, of, terrestrialization, morphological, analyses, including, fossils, tend, to, recover, the, tetrapulmonata, including, the, extinct, group, the, haptopoda, but, recover, other, ordinal, relationships, with, low, support, the, uraraneida, are, an, extinct, order, of, spider, like, arachnids, from, the, devonian, and, permian, a, fossil, arachnid, in, 100, million, year, old, mya, amber, from, myanmar, chimerarachne, yingi, has, spinnerets, to, produce, silk, it, also, has, a, tail, like, the, palaeozoic, uraraneida, some, 200, million, years, after, other, known, fossils, with, tails, the, fossil, resembles, the, most, primitive, living, spiders, the, mesotheles, the, subdivisions, of, the, arachnids, are, usually, treated, as, orders, historically, mites, and, ticks, were, treated, as, a, single, order, acari, however, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, suggest, that, the, two, groups, do, not, form, a, single, clade, with, morphological, similarities, being, due, to, convergence, they, are, now, usually, treated, as, two, separate, taxa, acariformes, mites, and, parasitiformes, ticks, which, may, be, ranked, as, orders, or, superorders, the, arachnid, subdivisions, are, listed, below, alphabetically, numbers, of, species, are, approximate, it, is, estimated, that, 110, 000, arachnid, species, have, been, described, and, that, there, may, be, over, a, million, in, total
