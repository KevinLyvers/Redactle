melanoma, is, the, most, dangerous, type, of, skin, cancer, it, develops, from, the, melanin, producing, cells, known, as, melanocytes, it, typically, occurs, in, the, skin, but, may, rarely, occur, in, the, mouth, intestines, or, eye, uveal, melanoma, in, women, melanomas, most, commonly, occur, on, the, legs, while, in, men, on, the, back, melanoma, is, frequently, referred, to, as, malignant, melanoma, however, the, medical, community, stresses, that, there, is, no, such, thing, as, a, benign, melanoma, and, recommends, that, the, term, malignant, melanoma, should, be, avoided, as, redundant, about, 25, of, melanomas, develop, from, moles, changes, in, a, mole, that, can, indicate, melanoma, include, increase, especially, rapid, increase, in, size, irregular, edges, change, in, color, itchiness, or, skin, breakdown, the, primary, cause, of, melanoma, is, ultraviolet, light, uv, exposure, in, those, with, low, levels, of, the, skin, pigment, melanin, the, uv, light, may, be, from, the, sun, or, other, sources, such, as, tanning, devices, those, with, many, moles, a, history, of, affected, family, members, and, poor, immune, function, are, at, greater, risk, a, number, of, rare, genetic, conditions, such, as, xeroderma, pigmentosum, also, increase, the, risk, diagnosis, is, by, biopsy, and, analysis, of, any, skin, lesion, that, has, signs, of, being, potentially, cancerous, avoiding, uv, light, and, using, sunscreen, in, uv, bright, sun, conditions, may, prevent, melanoma, treatment, typically, is, removal, by, surgery, of, the, melanoma, and, the, potentially, affected, adjacent, tissue, bordering, the, melanoma, in, those, with, slightly, larger, cancers, nearby, lymph, nodes, may, be, tested, for, spread, metastasis, most, people, are, cured, if, metastasis, has, not, occurred, for, those, in, whom, melanoma, has, spread, immunotherapy, biologic, therapy, radiation, therapy, or, chemotherapy, may, improve, survival, with, treatment, the, five, year, survival, rates, in, the, united, states, are, 99, among, those, with, localized, disease, 65, when, the, disease, has, spread, to, lymph, nodes, and, 25, among, those, with, distant, spread, the, likelihood, that, melanoma, will, reoccur, or, spread, depends, on, its, thickness, how, fast, the, cells, are, dividing, and, whether, or, not, the, overlying, skin, has, broken, down, melanoma, is, the, most, dangerous, type, of, skin, cancer, globally, in, 2012, it, newly, occurred, in, 232, 000, people, in, 2015, 3, 1, million, people, had, active, disease, which, resulted, in, 59, 800, deaths, australia, and, new, zealand, have, the, highest, rates, of, melanoma, in, the, world, high, rates, also, occur, in, northern, europe, and, north, america, while, it, is, less, common, in, asia, africa, and, latin, america, in, the, united, states, melanoma, occurs, about, 1, 6, times, more, often, in, men, than, women, melanoma, has, become, more, common, since, the, 1960s, in, areas, mostly, populated, by, people, of, european, descent, early, signs, of, melanoma, are, changes, to, the, shape, or, color, of, existing, moles, or, in, the, case, of, nodular, melanoma, the, appearance, of, a, new, lump, anywhere, on, the, skin, at, later, stages, the, mole, may, itch, ulcerate, or, bleed, early, signs, of, melanoma, are, summarized, by, the, mnemonic, abcdeefg, this, classification, does, not, apply, to, nodular, melanoma, which, has, its, own, classifications, metastatic, melanoma, may, cause, nonspecific, paraneoplastic, symptoms, including, loss, of, appetite, nausea, vomiting, and, fatigue, metastasis, spread, of, early, melanoma, is, possible, but, relatively, rare, less, than, a, fifth, of, melanomas, diagnosed, early, become, metastatic, brain, metastases, are, particularly, common, in, patients, with, metastatic, melanoma, it, can, also, spread, to, the, liver, bones, abdomen, or, distant, lymph, nodes, melanomas, are, usually, caused, by, dna, damage, resulting, from, exposure, to, uv, light, from, the, sun, genetics, also, play, a, role, melanoma, can, also, occur, in, skin, areas, with, little, sun, exposure, i, e, mouth, soles, of, feet, palms, of, hands, genital, areas, people, with, dysplastic, nevus, syndrome, also, known, as, familial, atypical, multiple, mole, melanoma, are, at, increased, risk, for, the, development, of, melanoma, having, more, than, 50, moles, indicates, an, increased, risk, in, melanoma, might, arise, a, weakened, immune, system, makes, cancer, development, easier, due, to, the, body, s, weakened, ability, to, fight, cancer, cells, uv, radiation, exposure, from, tanning, beds, increases, the, risk, of, melanoma, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, finds, that, tanning, beds, are, carcinogenic, to, humans, and, that, people, who, begin, using, tanning, devices, before, the, age, of, thirty, years, are, 75, more, likely, to, develop, melanoma, those, who, work, in, airplanes, also, appear, to, have, an, increased, risk, believed, to, be, due, to, greater, exposure, to, uv, uvb, light, emanating, from, the, sun, at, wavelengths, between, 315, and, 280, nm, is, absorbed, directly, by, dna, in, skin, cells, which, results, in, a, type, of, direct, dna, damage, called, cyclobutane, pyrimidine, dimers, thymine, cytosine, or, cytosine, thymine, dimers, are, formed, by, the, joining, of, two, adjacent, pyrimidine, bases, within, a, strand, of, dna, uva, light, presents, at, wavelengths, longer, than, uvb, between, 400, and, 315, nm, and, it, can, also, be, absorbed, directly, by, dna, in, skin, cells, but, at, lower, efficiencies, about, 1, 100, to, 1, 1000, of, uvb, exposure, to, radiation, uva, and, uvb, is, a, major, contributor, to, developing, melanoma, occasional, extreme, sun, exposure, that, results, in, sunburn, on, areas, of, the, human, body, is, causally, related, to, melanoma, and, such, areas, of, only, intermittent, exposure, apparently, explains, why, melanoma, is, more, common, on, the, back, in, men, and, on, the, legs, in, women, the, risk, appears, to, be, strongly, influenced, by, socioeconomic, conditions, rather, than, indoor, versus, outdoor, occupations, it, is, more, common, in, professional, and, administrative, workers, than, unskilled, workers, other, factors, are, mutations, in, or, total, loss, of, tumor, suppressor, genes, using, sunbeds, with, their, deeply, penetrating, uva, rays, has, been, linked, to, the, development, of, skin, cancers, including, melanoma, possible, significant, elements, in, determining, risk, include, the, intensity, and, duration, of, sun, exposure, the, age, at, which, sun, exposure, occurs, and, the, degree, of, skin, pigmentation, melanoma, rates, tend, to, be, highest, in, countries, settled, by, migrants, from, northern, europe, which, have, a, large, amount, of, direct, intense, sunlight, to, which, the, skin, of, the, settlers, is, not, adapted, most, notably, australia, exposure, during, childhood, is, a, more, important, risk, factor, than, exposure, in, adulthood, this, is, seen, in, migration, studies, in, australia, incurring, multiple, severe, sunburns, increases, the, likelihood, that, future, sunburns, develop, into, melanoma, due, to, cumulative, damage, uv, high, sunlight, and, tanning, beds, are, the, main, sources, of, uv, radiation, that, increase, the, risk, for, melanoma, and, living, close, to, the, equator, increases, exposure, to, uv, radiation, a, number, of, rare, mutations, which, often, run, in, families, greatly, increase, melanoma, susceptibility, several, genes, increase, risks, some, rare, genes, have, a, relatively, high, risk, of, causing, melanoma, some, more, common, genes, such, as, a, gene, called, mc1r, that, causes, red, hair, have, a, relatively, lower, elevated, risk, genetic, testing, can, be, used, to, search, for, the, mutations, one, class, of, mutations, affects, the, gene, cdkn2a, an, alternative, reading, frame, mutation, in, this, gene, leads, to, the, destabilization, of, p53, a, transcription, factor, involved, in, apoptosis, and, in, 50, of, human, cancers, another, mutation, in, the, same, gene, results, in, a, nonfunctional, inhibitor, of, cdk4, a, cyclin, dependent, kinase, that, promotes, cell, division, mutations, that, cause, the, skin, condition, xeroderma, pigmentosum, xp, also, increase, melanoma, susceptibility, scattered, throughout, the, genome, these, mutations, reduce, a, cell, s, ability, to, repair, dna, both, cdkn2a, and, xp, mutations, are, highly, penetrant, the, chances, of, a, carrier, to, express, the, phenotype, is, high, familial, melanoma, is, genetically, heterogeneous, and, loci, for, familial, melanoma, appear, on, the, chromosome, arms, 1p, 9p, and, 12q, multiple, genetic, events, have, been, related, to, melanoma, s, pathogenesis, disease, development, the, multiple, tumor, suppressor, 1, cdkn2a, mts1, gene, encodes, p16ink4a, a, low, molecular, weight, protein, inhibitor, of, cyclin, dependent, protein, kinases, cdks, which, has, been, localised, to, the, p21, region, of, human, chromosome, 9, fammm, is, typically, characterized, by, having, 50, or, more, combined, moles, in, addition, to, a, family, history, of, melanoma, it, is, transmitted, autosomal, dominantly, and, mostly, associated, with, the, cdkn2a, mutations, people, who, have, cdkn2a, mutation, associated, fammm, have, a, 38, fold, increased, risk, of, pancreatic, cancer, other, mutations, confer, lower, risk, but, are, more, common, in, the, population, people, with, mutations, in, the, mc1r, gene, are, two, to, four, times, more, likely, to, develop, melanoma, than, those, with, two, wild, type, typical, unaffected, type, copies, mc1r, mutations, are, very, common, and, all, red, haired, people, have, a, mutated, copy, mutation, of, the, mdm2, snp309, gene, is, associated, with, increased, risks, for, younger, women, fair, and, red, haired, people, persons, with, multiple, atypical, nevi, or, dysplastic, nevi, and, persons, born, with, giant, congenital, melanocytic, nevi, are, at, increased, risk, a, family, history, of, melanoma, greatly, increases, a, person, s, risk, because, mutations, in, several, genes, have, been, found, in, melanoma, prone, families, people, with, a, history, of, one, melanoma, are, at, increased, risk, of, developing, a, second, primary, tumor, fair, skin, is, the, result, of, having, less, melanin, in, the, skin, which, means, less, protection, from, uv, radiation, exists, the, earliest, stage, of, melanoma, starts, when, melanocytes, begin, out, of, control, growth, melanocytes, are, found, between, the, outer, layer, of, the, skin, the, epidermis, and, the, next, layer, the, dermis, this, early, stage, of, the, disease, is, called, the, radial, growth, phase, when, the, tumor, is, less, than, 1, mm, thick, and, spreads, at, the, level, of, the, basal, epidermis, because, the, cancer, cells, have, not, yet, reached, the, blood, vessels, deeper, in, the, skin, it, is, very, unlikely, that, this, early, stage, melanoma, will, spread, to, other, parts, of, the, body, if, the, melanoma, is, detected, at, this, stage, then, it, can, usually, be, completely, removed, with, surgery, when, the, tumor, cells, start, to, move, in, a, different, direction, vertically, up, into, the, epidermis, and, into, the, papillary, dermis, cell, behaviour, changes, dramatically, the, next, step, in, the, evolution, is, the, invasive, radial, growth, phase, in, which, individual, cells, start, to, acquire, invasive, potential, from, this, point, on, melanoma, is, capable, of, spreading, the, breslow, s, depth, of, the, lesion, is, usually, less, than, 1, mm, 0, 04, in, while, the, clark, level, is, usually, 2, the, vertical, growth, phase, vgp, following, is, invasive, melanoma, the, tumor, becomes, able, to, grow, into, the, surrounding, tissue, and, can, spread, around, the, body, through, blood, or, lymph, vessels, the, tumor, thickness, is, usually, more, than, 1, mm, 0, 04, in, and, the, tumor, involves, the, deeper, parts, of, the, dermis, the, host, elicits, an, immunological, reaction, against, the, tumor, during, the, vgp, which, is, judged, by, the, presence, and, activity, of, the, tumor, infiltrating, lymphocytes, tils, these, cells, sometimes, completely, destroy, the, primary, tumor, this, is, called, regression, which, is, the, latest, stage, of, development, in, certain, cases, the, primary, tumor, is, completely, destroyed, and, only, the, metastatic, tumor, is, discovered, about, 40, of, human, melanomas, contain, activating, mutations, affecting, the, structure, of, the, b, raf, protein, resulting, in, constitutive, signaling, through, the, raf, to, map, kinase, pathway, a, cause, common, to, most, cancers, is, damage, to, dna, uva, light, mainly, causes, thymine, dimers, uva, also, produces, reactive, oxygen, species, and, these, inflict, other, dna, damage, primarily, single, strand, breaks, oxidized, pyrimidines, and, the, oxidized, purine, 8, oxoguanine, a, mutagenic, dna, change, at, 1, 10, 1, 10, and, 1, 3rd, the, frequencies, of, uva, induced, thymine, dimers, respectively, if, unrepaired, cyclobutane, pyrimidine, dimer, cpd, photoproducts, can, lead, to, mutations, by, inaccurate, translesion, synthesis, during, dna, replication, or, repair, the, most, frequent, mutations, due, to, inaccurate, synthesis, past, cpds, are, cytosine, to, thymine, c, t, or, cc, tt, transition, mutations, these, are, commonly, referred, to, as, uv, fingerprint, mutations, as, they, are, the, most, specific, mutation, caused, by, uv, being, frequently, found, in, sun, exposed, skin, but, rarely, found, in, internal, organs, errors, in, dna, repair, of, uv, photoproducts, or, inaccurate, synthesis, past, these, photoproducts, can, also, lead, to, deletions, insertions, and, chromosomal, translocations, the, entire, genomes, of, 25, melanomas, were, sequenced, on, average, about, 80, 000, mutated, bases, mostly, c, t, transitions, and, about, 100, structural, rearrangements, were, found, per, melanoma, genome, this, is, much, higher, than, the, roughly, 70, mutations, across, generations, parent, to, child, among, the, 25, melanomas, about, 6, 000, protein, coding, genes, had, missense, nonsense, or, splice, site, mutations, the, transcriptomes, of, over, 100, melanomas, has, also, been, sequenced, and, analyzed, almost, 70, of, all, human, protein, coding, genes, are, expressed, in, melanoma, most, of, these, genes, are, also, expressed, in, other, normal, and, cancer, tissues, with, some, 200, genes, showing, a, more, specific, expression, pattern, in, melanoma, compared, to, other, forms, of, cancer, examples, of, melanoma, specific, genes, are, tyrosinase, mlana, and, pmel, uv, radiation, causes, damage, to, the, dna, of, cells, typically, thymine, dimerization, which, when, unrepaired, can, create, mutations, in, the, cell, s, genes, this, strong, mutagenic, factor, makes, cutaneous, melanoma, the, tumor, type, with, the, highest, number, of, mutations, when, the, cell, divides, these, mutations, are, propagated, to, new, generations, of, cells, if, the, mutations, occur, in, protooncogenes, or, tumor, suppressor, genes, the, rate, of, mitosis, in, the, mutation, bearing, cells, can, become, uncontrolled, leading, to, the, formation, of, a, tumor, data, from, patients, suggest, that, aberrant, levels, of, activating, transcription, factor, in, the, nucleus, of, melanoma, cells, are, associated, with, increased, metastatic, activity, of, melanoma, cells, studies, from, mice, on, skin, cancer, tend, to, confirm, a, role, for, activating, transcription, factor, 2, in, cancer, progression, cancer, stem, cells, may, also, be, involved, large, scale, studies, such, as, the, cancer, genome, atlas, have, characterized, recurrent, somatic, alterations, likely, driving, initiation, and, development, of, cutaneous, melanoma, the, cancer, genome, atlas, study, has, established, four, subtypes, braf, mutant, ras, mutant, nf1, mutant, and, triple, wild, type, the, most, frequent, mutation, occurs, in, the, 600th, codon, of, braf, 50, of, cases, braf, is, normally, involved, in, cell, growth, and, this, specific, mutation, renders, the, protein, constitutively, active, and, independent, of, normal, physiological, regulation, thus, fostering, tumor, growth, ras, genes, nras, hras, and, kras, are, also, recurrently, mutated, 30, of, tcga, cases, and, mutations, in, the, 61st, or, 12th, codons, trigger, oncogenic, activity, loss, of, function, mutations, often, affect, tumor, suppressor, genes, such, as, nf1, tp53, and, cdkn2a, other, oncogenic, alterations, include, fusions, involving, various, kinases, such, as, braf, raf1, alk, ret, ros1, ntrk1, ntrk3, and, met, braf, ras, and, nf1, mutations, and, kinase, fusions, are, remarkably, mutually, exclusive, as, they, occur, in, different, subsets, of, patients, assessment, of, mutation, status, can, therefore, improve, patient, stratification, and, inform, targeted, therapy, with, specific, inhibitors, in, some, cases, 3, 7, mutated, versions, of, braf, and, nras, undergo, copy, number, amplification, the, research, done, by, sarna, s, team, proved, that, heavily, pigmented, melanoma, cells, have, young, s, modulus, about, 4, 93, when, in, non, pigmented, ones, it, was, only, 0, 98, in, another, experiment, they, found, that, elasticity, of, melanoma, cells, is, important, for, its, metastasis, and, growth, non, pigmented, tumors, were, bigger, than, pigmented, and, it, was, much, easier, for, them, to, spread, they, shown, that, there, are, both, pigmented, and, non, pigmented, cells, in, melanoma, tumors, so, that, they, can, both, be, drug, resistant, and, metastatic, looking, at, or, visually, inspecting, the, area, in, question, is, the, most, common, method, of, suspecting, a, melanoma, moles, that, are, irregular, in, color, or, shape, are, typically, treated, as, candidates, to, detect, melanomas, and, increase, survival, rates, it, is, recommended, to, learn, to, recognize, them, see, abcde, mnemonic, to, regularly, examine, moles, for, changes, shape, size, color, itching, or, bleeding, and, to, consult, a, qualified, physician, when, a, candidate, appears, in, person, inspection, of, suspicious, skin, lesions, is, more, accurate, than, visual, inspection, of, images, of, suspicious, skin, lesions, when, used, by, trained, specialists, dermoscopy, is, more, helpful, to, identify, malignant, lesions, than, use, of, the, naked, eye, alone, reflectance, confocal, microscopy, may, have, better, sensitivity, and, specificity, than, dermoscopy, in, diagnosing, cutaneous, melanoma, but, more, studies, are, needed, to, confirm, this, result, however, many, melanomas, present, as, lesions, smaller, than, 6, mm, in, diameter, and, all, melanomas, are, malignant, when, they, first, appear, as, a, small, dot, physicians, typically, examine, all, moles, including, those, less, than, 6, mm, in, diameter, seborrheic, keratosis, may, meet, some, or, all, of, the, abcd, criteria, and, can, lead, to, false, alarms, doctors, can, generally, distinguish, seborrheic, keratosis, from, melanoma, upon, examination, or, with, dermatoscopy, some, advocate, replacing, enlarging, with, evolving, moles, that, change, and, evolve, are, a, concern, alternatively, some, practitioners, prefer, elevation, elevation, can, help, identify, a, melanoma, but, lack, of, elevation, does, not, mean, that, the, lesion, is, not, a, melanoma, most, melanomas, in, the, us, are, detected, before, they, become, elevated, by, the, time, elevation, is, visible, they, may, have, progressed, to, the, more, dangerous, invasive, stage, one, method, is, the, ugly, duckling, sign, correlation, of, common, lesion, characteristics, is, made, lesions, that, deviate, from, the, common, characteristics, are, labeled, an, ugly, duckling, and, a, further, professional, exam, is, required, the, little, red, riding, hood, sign, suggests, that, individuals, with, fair, skin, and, light, colored, hair, might, have, difficult, to, diagnose, amelanotic, melanomas, extra, care, is, required, when, examining, such, individuals, as, they, might, have, multiple, melanomas, and, severely, dysplastic, nevi, a, dermatoscope, must, be, used, to, detect, ugly, ducklings, as, many, melanomas, in, these, individuals, resemble, nonmelanomas, or, are, considered, to, be, wolves, in, sheep, s, clothing, these, fair, skinned, individuals, often, have, lightly, pigmented, or, amelanotic, melanomas, that, do, not, present, easy, to, observe, color, changes, and, variations, their, borders, are, often, indistinct, complicating, visual, identification, without, a, dermatoscope, amelanotic, melanomas, and, melanomas, arising, in, fair, skinned, individuals, are, very, difficult, to, detect, as, they, fail, to, show, many, of, the, characteristics, in, the, abcd, rule, break, the, ugly, duckling, sign, and, are, hard, to, distinguish, from, acne, scarring, insect, bites, dermatofibromas, or, lentigines, following, a, visual, examination, and, a, dermatoscopic, exam, or, in, vivo, diagnostic, tools, such, as, a, confocal, microscope, the, doctor, may, biopsy, the, suspicious, mole, a, skin, biopsy, performed, under, local, anesthesia, is, often, required, to, assist, in, making, or, confirming, the, diagnosis, and, in, defining, severity, elliptical, excisional, biopsies, may, remove, the, tumor, followed, by, histological, analysis, and, breslow, scoring, incisional, biopsies, such, as, punch, biopsies, are, usually, contraindicated, in, suspected, melanomas, because, of, the, possibility, of, sampling, error, or, local, implantation, causing, misestimation, of, tumour, thickness, however, fears, that, such, biopsies, may, increase, the, risk, of, metastatic, disease, seem, unfounded, total, body, photography, which, involves, photographic, documentation, of, as, much, body, surface, as, possible, is, often, used, during, follow, up, for, high, risk, patients, the, technique, has, been, reported, to, enable, early, detection, and, provides, a, cost, effective, approach, with, any, digital, camera, but, its, efficacy, has, been, questioned, due, to, its, inability, to, detect, macroscopic, changes, the, diagnosis, method, should, be, used, in, conjunction, with, and, not, as, a, replacement, for, dermoscopic, imaging, with, a, combination, of, both, methods, appearing, to, give, extremely, high, rates, of, detection, melanoma, is, a, type, of, neuroectodermal, neoplasm, there, are, four, main, types, of, melanoma, other, histopathologic, types, are, a, melanoma, in, situ, has, not, invaded, beyond, the, basement, membrane, whereas, an, invasive, melanoma, has, spread, beyond, it, some, histopathological, types, of, melanoma, are, inherently, invasive, including, nodular, melanoma, and, lentigo, maligna, melanoma, where, the, in, situ, counterpart, to, lentigo, maligna, melanoma, is, lentigo, maligna, lentigo, maligna, is, sometimes, classified, as, a, very, early, melanoma, and, sometimes, a, precursor, to, melanoma, superficial, spreading, melanomas, and, acral, lentiginous, melanomas, can, be, either, in, situ, or, invasive, but, acral, lentiginous, melanomas, are, almost, always, invasive, further, context, on, cancer, staging, is, available, at, tnm, metastatic, melanomas, can, be, detected, by, x, rays, ct, scans, mris, pet, and, pet, cts, ultrasound, ldh, testing, and, photoacoustic, detection, however, there, is, lack, of, evidence, in, the, accuracy, of, staging, of, people, with, melanoma, with, various, imaging, methods, melanoma, stages, according, to, ajcc, 8th, edition, stage, 1, and, 2, require, an, n, lymph, node, class, of, stage, 1, 2, and, 3, require, an, m, metastasis, status, of, older, systems, include, clark, level, and, breslow, s, depth, quantifying, microscopic, depth, of, tumor, invasion, lactate, dehydrogenase, ldh, tests, are, often, used, to, screen, for, metastases, although, many, patients, with, metastases, even, end, stage, have, a, normal, ldh, extraordinarily, high, ldh, often, indicates, the, metastatic, spread, of, the, disease, to, the, liver, it, is, common, for, patients, diagnosed, with, melanoma, to, have, chest, x, rays, and, an, ldh, test, and, in, some, cases, ct, mri, and, or, pet, scans, although, controversial, sentinel, lymph, node, biopsies, and, examination, of, the, lymph, nodes, are, also, performed, in, patients, to, assess, spread, to, the, lymph, nodes, a, diagnosis, of, melanoma, is, supported, by, the, presence, of, the, s, 100, protein, marker, hmb, 45, is, a, monoclonal, antibody, that, reacts, against, an, antigen, present, in, melanocytic, tumors, such, as, melanomas, it, is, used, in, anatomic, pathology, as, a, marker, for, such, tumors, the, antibody, was, generated, to, an, extract, of, melanoma, it, reacts, positively, against, melanocytic, tumors, but, not, other, tumors, thus, demonstrating, specificity, and, sensitivity, the, antibody, also, reacts, positively, against, junctional, nevus, cells, but, not, intradermal, nevi, and, against, fetal, melanocytes, but, not, normal, adult, melanocytes, hmb, 45, is, nonreactive, with, almost, all, non, melanoma, human, malignancies, with, the, exception, of, rare, tumors, showing, evidence, of, melanogenesis, e, g, pigmented, schwannoma, clear, cell, sarcoma, or, tumors, associated, with, tuberous, sclerosis, complex, angiomyolipoma, and, lymphangiomyoma, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, or, refute, adult, population, screening, for, melanoma, minimizing, exposure, to, sources, of, ultraviolet, radiation, the, sun, and, sunbeds, following, sun, protection, measures, and, wearing, sun, protective, clothing, long, sleeved, shirts, long, trousers, and, broad, brimmed, hats, can, offer, protection, using, artificial, light, for, tanning, was, once, believed, to, help, prevent, skin, cancers, but, it, can, actually, lead, to, an, increased, incidence, of, melanomas, uv, nail, lamps, which, are, used, in, nail, salons, to, dry, nail, polish, are, another, common, and, widespread, source, of, uv, radiation, that, could, be, avoided, although, the, risk, of, developing, skin, cancer, through, uv, nail, lamp, use, is, low, it, is, still, recommended, to, wear, fingerless, gloves, and, or, apply, spf, 30, or, greater, sunscreen, to, the, hands, before, using, a, uv, nail, lamp, the, body, uses, uv, light, to, generate, vitamin, d, so, there, is, a, need, to, balance, getting, enough, sunlight, to, maintain, healthy, vitamin, d, levels, and, reducing, the, risk, of, melanoma, it, takes, around, a, half, hour, of, sunlight, for, the, body, to, generate, its, vitamin, d, for, the, day, and, this, is, about, the, same, amount, of, time, it, takes, for, fair, skinned, people, to, get, a, sunburn, exposure, to, sunlight, can, be, intermittent, instead, of, all, at, one, time, sunscreen, appears, to, be, effective, in, preventing, melanoma, in, the, past, use, of, sunscreens, with, a, sun, protection, factor, spf, rating, of, 50, or, higher, on, exposed, areas, were, recommended, as, older, sunscreens, more, effectively, blocked, uva, with, higher, spf, currently, newer, sunscreen, ingredients, avobenzone, zinc, oxide, and, titanium, dioxide, effectively, block, both, uva, and, uvb, even, at, lower, spfs, sunscreen, also, protects, against, squamous, cell, carcinoma, another, skin, cancer, concerns, have, been, raised, that, sunscreen, might, create, a, false, sense, of, security, against, sun, damage, a, 2005, review, found, tentative, evidence, that, statin, and, fibrate, medication, may, decrease, the, risk, of, melanoma, a, 2006, review, however, did, not, support, any, benefit, confirmation, of, the, clinical, diagnosis, is, done, with, a, skin, biopsy, this, is, usually, followed, up, with, a, wider, excision, of, the, scar, or, tumor, depending, on, the, stage, a, sentinel, lymph, node, biopsy, may, be, performed, controversy, exists, around, trial, evidence, for, sentinel, lymph, node, biopsy, with, unclear, evidence, of, benefit, as, of, 2015, treatment, of, advanced, melanoma, is, performed, from, a, multidisciplinary, approach, excisional, biopsies, may, remove, the, tumor, but, further, surgery, is, often, necessary, to, reduce, the, risk, of, recurrence, complete, surgical, excision, with, adequate, surgical, margins, and, assessment, for, the, presence, of, detectable, metastatic, disease, along, with, short, and, long, term, followup, is, standard, often, this, is, done, by, a, wide, local, excision, wle, with, 1, 2, cm, 0, 4, 0, 8, in, margins, melanoma, in, situ, and, lentigo, malignas, are, treated, with, narrower, surgical, margins, usually, 0, 2, 0, 5, cm, 0, 1, 0, 2, in, many, surgeons, consider, 0, 5, cm, 0, 2, in, the, standard, of, care, for, standard, excision, of, melanoma, in, situ, but, 0, 2, cm, 0, 1, in, margin, might, be, acceptable, for, margin, controlled, surgery, mohs, surgery, or, the, double, bladed, technique, with, margin, control, the, wide, excision, aims, to, reduce, the, rate, of, tumor, recurrence, at, the, site, of, the, original, lesion, this, is, a, common, pattern, of, treatment, failure, in, melanoma, considerable, research, has, aimed, to, elucidate, appropriate, margins, for, excision, with, a, general, trend, toward, less, aggressive, treatment, during, the, last, decades, a, 2009, meta, analysis, of, randomized, controlled, trials, found, a, small, difference, in, survival, rates, favoring, wide, excision, of, primary, cutaneous, melanomas, but, these, results, were, not, statistically, significant, mohs, surgery, has, been, reported, with, cure, rate, as, low, as, 77, and, as, high, as, 98, 0, for, melanoma, in, situ, ccpdma, and, the, double, scalpel, peripheral, margin, controlled, surgery, is, equivalent, to, mohs, surgery, in, effectiveness, on, this, intra, epithelial, type, of, melanoma, melanomas, that, spread, usually, do, so, to, the, lymph, nodes, in, the, area, of, the, tumor, before, spreading, elsewhere, attempts, to, improve, survival, by, removing, lymph, nodes, surgically, lymphadenectomy, were, associated, with, many, complications, but, no, overall, survival, benefit, recently, the, technique, of, sentinel, lymph, node, biopsy, has, been, developed, to, reduce, the, complications, of, lymph, node, surgery, while, allowing, assessment, of, the, involvement, of, nodes, with, tumor, biopsy, of, sentinel, lymph, nodes, is, a, widely, used, procedure, when, treating, cutaneous, melanoma, neither, sentinel, lymph, node, biopsy, nor, other, diagnostic, tests, should, be, performed, to, evaluate, early, thin, melanoma, including, melanoma, in, situ, t1a, melanoma, or, t1b, melanoma, 0, 5mm, people, with, these, conditions, are, unlikely, to, have, the, cancer, spread, to, their, lymph, nodes, or, anywhere, else, and, have, a, 5, year, survival, rate, of, 97, because, of, these, considerations, sentinel, lymph, node, biopsy, is, considered, unnecessary, health, care, for, them, furthermore, baseline, blood, tests, and, radiographic, studies, should, not, be, performed, only, based, on, identifying, this, kind, of, melanoma, as, there, are, more, accurate, tests, for, detecting, cancer, and, these, tests, have, high, false, positive, rates, to, potentially, correct, false, positives, gene, expression, profiling, may, be, used, as, auxiliary, testing, for, ambiguous, and, small, lesions, sentinel, lymph, node, biopsy, is, often, performed, especially, for, t1b, t2, tumors, mucosal, tumors, ocular, melanoma, and, tumors, of, the, limbs, a, process, called, lymphoscintigraphy, is, performed, in, which, a, radioactive, tracer, is, injected, at, the, tumor, site, to, localize, the, sentinel, node, s, further, precision, is, provided, using, a, blue, tracer, dye, and, surgery, is, performed, to, biopsy, the, node, s, routine, hematoxylin, and, eosin, h, e, and, immunoperoxidase, staining, will, be, adequate, to, rule, out, node, involvement, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, tests, on, nodes, usually, performed, to, test, for, entry, into, clinical, trials, now, demonstrate, that, many, patients, with, a, negative, sentinel, lymph, node, actually, had, a, small, number, of, positive, cells, in, their, nodes, alternatively, a, fine, needle, aspiration, biopsy, may, be, performed, and, is, often, used, to, test, masses, if, a, lymph, node, is, positive, depending, on, the, extent, of, lymph, node, spread, a, radical, lymph, node, dissection, will, often, be, performed, if, the, disease, is, completely, resected, the, patient, will, be, considered, for, adjuvant, therapy, excisional, skin, biopsy, is, the, management, of, choice, here, the, suspect, lesion, is, totally, removed, with, an, adequate, but, minimal, usually, 1, or, 2, mm, ellipse, of, surrounding, skin, and, tissue, to, avoid, disruption, of, the, local, lymphatic, drainage, the, preferred, surgical, margin, for, the, initial, biopsy, should, be, narrow, 1, mm, the, biopsy, should, include, the, epidermal, dermal, and, subcutaneous, layers, of, the, skin, this, enables, the, histopathologist, to, determine, the, thickness, of, the, melanoma, by, microscopic, examination, this, is, described, by, breslow, s, thickness, measured, in, millimeters, however, for, large, lesions, such, as, suspected, lentigo, maligna, or, for, lesions, in, surgically, difficult, areas, face, toes, fingers, eyelids, a, small, punch, biopsy, in, representative, areas, will, give, adequate, information, and, will, not, disrupt, the, final, staging, or, depth, determination, in, no, circumstances, should, the, initial, biopsy, include, the, final, surgical, margin, 0, 5, cm, 1, 0, cm, or, 2, cm, as, a, misdiagnosis, can, result, in, excessive, scarring, and, morbidity, from, the, procedure, a, large, initial, excision, will, disrupt, the, local, lymphatic, drainage, and, can, affect, further, lymphangiogram, directed, lymphnode, dissection, a, small, punch, biopsy, can, be, used, at, any, time, where, for, logistical, and, personal, reasons, a, patient, refuses, more, invasive, excisional, biopsy, small, punch, biopsies, are, minimally, invasive, and, heal, quickly, usually, without, noticeable, scarring, adjuvant, treatment, after, surgery, may, reduce, the, risk, of, recurrence, after, surgery, especially, in, high, risk, melanomas, routines, vary, in, different, countries, but, today, 2024, the, most, common, adjuvant, treatment, is, immune, checkpoint, inhibitor, treatment, for, up, to, a, year, post, surgery, in, the, early, 2000s, a, relatively, common, strategy, was, to, treat, patients, with, high, risk, of, recurrence, with, up, to, a, year, of, high, dose, interferon, treatment, which, has, severe, side, effects, but, may, improve, the, patient, s, prognosis, slightly, a, 2013, meta, analysis, suggested, that, the, addition, of, interferon, alpha, increased, disease, free, and, overall, survival, for, people, with, ajcc, tnm, stage, ii, iii, cutaneous, melanoma, a, 2011, meta, analysis, showed, that, interferon, could, lengthen, the, time, before, a, melanoma, comes, back, but, increased, survival, by, only, 3, at, 5, years, the, unpleasant, side, effects, also, greatly, decrease, quality, of, life, in, the, european, union, interferon, is, usually, not, used, outside, the, scope, of, clinical, trials, chemotherapy, drugs, such, as, dacarbazine, have, been, the, backbone, of, metastatic, melanoma, treatment, since, fda, approval, in, 1975, however, its, efficacy, in, terms, of, survival, has, never, been, proven, in, an, rct, since, the, approval, of, immune, checkpoint, inhibitors, dacarbazine, and, its, oral, counterpart, temozolomide, constitute, potential, treatment, options, in, later, lines, of, therapy, multiple, drugs, are, available, to, patients, to, decrease, the, size, of, the, tumor, by, lessening, the, size, of, the, tumor, some, symptoms, can, be, relieved, however, this, does, not, necessarily, lead, to, remission, some, of, these, drugs, are, dacarbazine, temozolomide, and, fotemustine, combinations, of, drugs, are, also, used, and, in, some, cases, present, higher, remission, rates, these, medication, combinations, can, have, harmful, side, effects, to, maintain, quality, of, life, patients, require, assistive, treatments, and, observation, although, combinations, of, drugs, increase, remission, rates, the, survival,

does, not, prolong, survival, radioimmunotherapy, of, metastatic, melanoma, is, currently, under, investigation, radiotherapy, has, a, role, in, the, palliation, of, metastatic, melanoma, factors, that, affect, prognosis, include, certain, types, of, melanoma, have, worse, prognoses, but, this, is, explained, by, their, thickness, less, invasive, melanomas, even, with, lymph, node, metastases, carry, a, better, prognosis, than, deep, melanomas, without, regional, metastasis, at, time, of, staging, local, recurrences, tend, to, behave, similarly, to, a, primary, unless, they, are, at, the, site, of, a, wide, local, excision, as, opposed, to, a, staged, excision, or, punch, shave, excision, since, these, recurrences, tend, to, indicate, lymphatic, invasion, when, melanomas, have, spread, to, the, lymph, nodes, one, of, the, most, important, factors, is, the, number, of, nodes, with, malignancy, extent, of, malignancy, within, a, node, is, also, important, micrometastases, in, which, malignancy, is, only, microscopic, have, a, more, favorable, prognosis, than, macrometastases, in, some, cases, micrometastases, may, only, be, detected, by, special, staining, and, if, malignancy, is, only, detectable, by, a, rarely, employed, test, known, as, the, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, the, prognosis, is, better, macro, metastases, in, which, malignancy, is, clinically, apparent, in, some, cases, cancer, completely, replaces, a, node, have, a, far, worse, prognosis, and, if, nodes, are, matted, or, if, there, is, extracapsular, extension, the, prognosis, is, worse, still, in, addition, to, these, variables, expression, levels, and, copy, number, variations, of, a, number, of, relevant, genes, may, be, used, to, support, assessment, of, melanoma, prognosis, stage, iv,

cases, patients, may, live, many, months, or, even, years, with, metastatic, melanoma, depending, on, the, aggressiveness, of, the, treatment, metastases, to, skin, and, lungs, have, a, better, prognosis, metastases, to, brain, bone, and, liver, are, associated, with, a, worse, prognosis, survival, is, better, with, metastasis, in, which, the, location, of, the, primary, tumor, is, unknown, there, is, not, enough, definitive, evidence, to, adequately, stage, and, thus, give, a, prognosis, for, ocular, melanoma, and, melanoma, of, soft, parts, or, mucosal, melanoma, e, g, rectal, melanoma, although, these, tend, to, metastasize, more, easily, even, though, regression, may, increase, survival, when, a, melanoma, has, regressed, it, is, impossible, to, know, its, original, size, and, thus, the, original, tumor, is, often, worse, than, a, pathology, report, might, indicate, about, 200, genes, are, prognostic, in, melanoma, with, both, unfavorable, genes, where, high, expression, is, correlated, to, poor, survival, and, favorable, genes, where, high, expression, is, associated, with, longer, survival, times, examples, of, unfavorable, genes, are, mcm6, and, timeless, an, example, of, a, favorable, gene, is, wipi1, an, increased, neutrophil, to, lymphocyte, ratio, is, associated, with, worse, outcomes, globally, in, 2012, melanoma, occurred, in, 232, 000, people, and, resulted, in, 55, 000, deaths, australia, and, new, zealand, have, the, highest, rates, of, melanoma, in, the, world, it, has, become, more, common, in, the, last, 20, years, in, areas, that, are, mostly, caucasian, the, rate, of, melanoma, has, increased, in, the, recent, years, but, it, is, not, clear, to, what, extent, changes, in, behavior, in, the, environment, or, in, early, detection, are, involved, australia, has, a, very, high, and, increasing, rate, of, melanoma, in, 2012, deaths, from, melanoma, occurred, in, 7, 3, 9, 8, per, 100, 000, population, in, australia, melanoma, is, the, third, most, common, cancer, in, either, sex, indeed, its, incidence, is, higher, than, for, lung, cancer, although, the, latter, accounts, for, more, deaths, it, is, estimated, that, in, 2012, more, than, 12, 000, australians, were, diagnosed, with, melanoma, given, australia, s, modest, population, this, is, better, expressed, as, 59, 6, new, cases, per, 100, 000, population, per, year, 1, in, 10, of, all, new, cancer, cases, were, melanomas, melanoma, incidence, in, australia, is, matter, of, significance, for, the, following, reasons, in, the, united, states, about, 9, 000, people, die, from, melanoma, a, year, in, 2011, it, affected, 19, 7, per, 100, 000, and, resulted, in, death, in, 2, 7, per, 100, 000, in, 2013, the, american, cancer, society, s, estimates, for, melanoma, incidence, in, the, united, states, for, 2017, are, melanoma, is, more, than, 20, times, more, common, in, whites, than, in, african, americans, overall, the, lifetime, risk, of, getting, melanoma, is, about, 2, 5, 1, in, 40, for, whites, 0, 1, 1, in, 1, 000, for, african, americans, and, 0, 5, 1, in, 200, for, mexicans, the, risk, of, melanoma, increases, as, people, age, the, average, age, of, people, when, the, disease, is, diagnosed, is, 63, although, melanoma, is, not, a, new, disease, evidence, for, its, occurrence, in, antiquity, is, rather, scarce, however, one, example, lies, in, a, 1960s, examination, of, nine, peruvian, mummies, radiocarbon, dated, to, be, approximately, 2400, years, old, which, showed, apparent, signs, of, melanoma, melanotic, masses, in, the, skin, and, diffuse, metastases, to, the, bones, john, hunter, is, reported, to, be, the, first, to, operate, on, metastatic, melanoma, in, 1787, although, not, knowing, precisely, what, it, was, he, described, it, as, a, cancerous, fungous, excrescence, the, excised, tumor, was, preserved, in, the, hunterian, museum, of, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, of, england, it, was, not, until, 1968, that, microscopic, examination, of, the, specimen, revealed, it, to, be, an, example, of, metastatic, melanoma, the, french, physician, ren, laennec, was, the, first, to, describe, melanoma, as, a, disease, entity, his, report, was, initially, presented, during, a, lecture, for, the, facult, de, m, decine, de, paris, in, 1804, and, then, published, as, a, bulletin, in, 1806, the, first, english, language, report, of, melanoma, was, presented, by, an, english, general, practitioner, from, stourbridge, william, norris, in, 1820, in, his, later, work, in, 1857, he, remarked, that, there, is, a, familial, predisposition, for, development, of, melanoma, eight, cases, of, melanosis, with, pathological, and, therapeutical, remarks, on, that, disease, norris, was, also, a, pioneer, in, suggesting, a, link, between, nevi, and, melanoma, and, the, possibility, of, a, relationship, between, melanoma, and, environmental, exposures, by, observing, that, most, of, his, patients, had, pale, complexions, he, also, described, that, melanomas, could, be, amelanotic, and, later, showed, the, metastatic, nature, of, melanoma, by, observing, that, they, can, disseminate, to, other, visceral, organs, the, first, formal, acknowledgment, of, advanced, melanoma, as, untreatable, came, from, samuel, cooper, in, 1840, he, stated, that, the, only, chance, for, a, cure, depends, upon, the, early, removal, of, the, disease, i, e, early, excision, of, the, malignant, mole, more, than, one, and, a, half, centuries, later, this, situation, remains, largely, unchanged, the, word, melanoma, came, to, english, from, 19th, century, neo, latin, and, uses, combining, forms, derived, from, ancient, greek, roots, melano, denoting, melanin, oma, denoting, a, tissue, mass, and, especially, a, neoplasm, in, turn, from, greek, melas, dark, and, oma, process, the, word, melanoma, has, a, long, history, of, being, used, in, a, broader, sense, to, refer, to, any, melanocytic, tumor, typically, but, not, always, malignant, but, today, the, narrower, sense, referring, only, to, malignant, types, has, become, so, dominant, that, benign, tumors, are, usually, not, called, melanomas, anymore, and, the, word, melanoma, is, now, usually, taken, to, mean, malignant, melanoma, unless, otherwise, specified, terms, such, as, benign, melanocytic, tumor, unequivocally, label, the, benign, types, and, modern, histopathologic, tumor, classifications, used, in, medicine, do, not, use, the, word, for, benign, tumors, pharmacotherapy, research, for, un, resectable, or, metastatic, melanoma, is, ongoing, in, clinical, research, adoptive, cell, therapy, and, gene, therapy, are, being, tested, two, kinds, of, experimental, treatments, developed, at, the, national, cancer, institute, nci, have, been, used, in, metastatic, melanoma, with, tentative, success, the, first, treatment, involves, adoptive, cell, therapy, act, using, tils, immune, cells, tumor, infiltrating, lymphocytes, isolated, from, a, person, s, own, melanoma, tumor, these, cells, are, grown, in, large, numbers, in, a, laboratory, and, returned, to, the, patient, after, a, treatment, that, temporarily, reduces, normal, t, cells, in, the, patient, s, body, til, therapy, following, lymphodepletion, can, result, in, durable, complete, response, in, a, variety, of, setups, the, second, treatment, adoptive, transfer, of, genetically, altered, autologous, lymphocytes, depends, on, delivering, genes, that, encode, so, called, t, cell, receptors, tcrs, into, patient, s, lymphocytes, after, that, manipulation, lymphocytes, recognize, and, bind, to, certain, molecules, found, on, the, surface, of, melanoma, cells, and, kill, them, a, cancer, vaccine, showed, modest, benefit, in, late, stage, testing, in, 2009, against, melanoma, about, 60, of, melanomas, contain, a, mutation, in, the, b, raf, gene, early, clinical, trials, suggested, that, b, raf, inhibitors, including, plexxicon, s, vemurafenib, could, lead, to, substantial, tumor, regression, in, a, majority, of, patients, if, their, tumor, contain, the, b, raf, mutation, in, june, 2011, a, large, clinical, trial, confirmed, the, positive, findings, from, those, earlier, trials, in, august, 2011, vemurafenib, received, fda, approval, for, the, treatment, of, late, stage, melanoma, in, may, 2013, the, us, fda, approved, dabrafenib, as, a, single, agent, treatment, for, patients, with, braf, v600e, mutation, positive, advanced, melanoma, some, researchers, believe, that, combination, therapies, that, simultaneously, block, multiple, pathways, may, improve, efficacy, by, making, it, more, difficult, for, the, tumor, cells, to, mutate, before, being, destroyed, in, october, 2012, a, study, reported, that, combining, dabrafenib, with, a, mek, inhibitor, trametinib, led, to, even, better, outcomes, compared, to, dabrafenib, alone, progression, free, survival, was, increased, to, 41, from, 9, and, the, median, progression, free, survival, increased, to, 9, 4, months, versus, 5, 8, months, some, side, effects, were, however, increased, in, the, combined, study, in, january, 2014, the, fda, approved, the, combination, of, dabrafenib, and, trametinib, for, the, treatment, of, people, with, braf, v600e, k, mutant, metastatic, melanoma, in, june, 2018, the, fda, approved, the, combination, of, a, braf, inhibitor, encorafenib, and, a, mek, inhibitor, binimetinib, for, the, treatment, of, un, resectable, or, metastatic, melanoma, with, a, braf, v600e, or, v600k, mutation, eventual, resistance, to, braf, and, mek, inhibitors, may, be, due, to, a, cell, surface, protein, known, as, epha2, which, is, now, being, investigated, at, the, american, society, of, clinical, oncology, conference, in, june, 2010, the, bristol, myers, squibb, pharmaceutical, company, reported, the, clinical, findings, of, their, drug, ipilimumab, the, study, found, an, increase, in, median, survival, from, 6, 4, to, 10, months, in, patients, with, advanced, melanomas, treated, with, the, monoclonal, ipilimumab, versus, an, experimental, vaccine, it, also, found, a, one, year, survival, rate, of, 25, in, the, control, group, using, the, vaccine, 44, in, the, vaccine, and, ipilimumab, group, and, 46, in, the, group, treated, with, ipilimumab, alone, however, some, have, raised, concerns, about, this, study, for, its, use, of, the, unconventional, control, arm, rather, than, comparing, the, drug, against, a, placebo, or, standard, treatment, the, criticism, was, that, although, ipilimumab, performed, better, than, the, vaccine, the, vaccine, has, not, been, tested, before, and, may, be, causing, toxicity, making, the, drug, appear, better, by, comparison, ipilimumab, was, approved, by, the, fda, in, march, 2011, to, treat, patients, with, late, stage, melanoma, that, has, spread, or, cannot, be, removed, by, surgery, in, june, 2011, a, clinical, trial, of, ipilimumab, plus, dacarbazine, combined, this, immune, system, booster, with, the, standard, chemotherapy, drug, that, targets, cell, division, it, showed, an, increase, in, median, survival, for, these, late, stage, patients, to, 11, months, instead, of, the, 9, months, normally, seen, researchers, were, also, hopeful, of, improving, the, five, year, survival, rate, though, serious, adverse, side, effects, were, seen, in, some, patients, a, course, of, treatment, costs, 120, 000, the, drug, s, brandname, is, yervoy, advances, in, high, resolution, ultrasound, scanning, have, enabled, surveillance, of, metastatic, burden, to, the, sentinel, lymph, nodes, the, screening, and, surveillance, of, ultrasound, in, melanoma, trial, sunmel, is, evaluating, ultrasound, as, an, alternative, to, invasive, surgical, methods, in, some, countries, oncolytic, virotherapy, methods, are, studied, and, used, to, treat, melanoma, oncolytic, virotherapy, is, a, promising, branch, of, virotherapy, where, oncolytic, viruses, are, used, to, treat, diseases, viruses, can, increase, metabolism, reduce, anti, tumor, immunity, and, disorganize, vasculature, talimogene, laherparepvec, t, vec, which, is, a, herpes, simplex, virus, type, 1, derived, oncolytic, immunotherapy, was, shown, to, be, useful, against, metastatic, melanoma, in, 2015, with, an, increased, survival, of, 4, 4, months, antiretrovirals, have, been, tested, in, vitro, against, melanoma, the, rationale, behind, this, lies, in, their, potential, to, inhibit, human, endogenous, retroviruses, whose, activity, has, been, associated, with, the, development, of, melanoma, the, results, on, malignant, cells, have, shown, moderate, efficacy, and, further, developments, are, awaited, through, animal, model, testing
