the, africanized, bee, also, known, as, the, africanized, honey, bee, ahb, and, colloquially, as, the, killer, bee, is, a, hybrid, of, the, western, honey, bee, apis, mellifera, produced, originally, by, crossbreeding, of, the, east, african, lowland, honey, bee, a, m, scutellata, with, various, european, honey, bee, subspecies, such, as, the, italian, honey, bee, a, m, ligustica, and, the, iberian, honey, bee, a, m, iberiensis, the, east, african, lowland, honey, bee, was, first, introduced, to, brazil, in, 1956, in, an, effort, to, increase, honey, production, but, 26, swarms, escaped, quarantine, in, 1957, since, then, the, hybrid, has, spread, throughout, south, america, and, arrived, in, north, america, in, 1985, hives, were, found, in, south, texas, in, the, united, states, in, 1990, africanized, honey, bees, are, typically, much, more, defensive, react, to, disturbances, faster, and, chase, people, further, 400, metres, 1, 300, ft, than, other, varieties, of, honey, bees, they, have, killed, some, 1, 000, humans, with, victims, receiving, 10, times, more, stings, than, from, european, honey, bees, they, have, also, killed, horses, and, other, animals, there, are, 29, recognized, subspecies, of, apis, mellifera, based, largely, on, geographic, variations, all, subspecies, are, cross, fertile, geographic, isolation, led, to, numerous, local, adaptations, these, adaptations, include, brood, cycles, synchronized, with, the, bloom, period, of, local, flora, forming, a, winter, cluster, in, colder, climates, migratory, swarming, in, africa, enhanced, long, distance, foraging, behavior, in, desert, areas, and, numerous, other, inherited, traits, the, africanized, honey, bees, in, the, western, hemisphere, are, descended, from, hives, operated, by, biologist, warwick, e, kerr, who, had, interbred, honey, bees, from, europe, and, southern, africa, kerr, was, attempting, to, breed, a, strain, of, bees, that, would, produce, more, honey, in, tropical, conditions, than, the, european, strain, of, honey, bee, then, in, use, throughout, north, central, and, south, america, the, hives, containing, this, particular, african, subspecies, were, housed, at, an, apiary, near, rio, claro, s, o, paulo, in, the, southeast, of, brazil, and, were, noted, to, be, especially, defensive, these, hives, had, been, fitted, with, special, excluder, screens, called, queen, excluders, to, prevent, the, larger, queen, bees, and, drones, from, getting, out, and, mating, with, the, local, population, of, european, bees, according, to, kerr, in, october, 1957, a, visiting, beekeeper, noticing, that, the, queen, excluders, were, interfering, with, the, worker, bees, movement, removed, them, resulting, in, the, accidental, release, of, 26, tanganyikan, swarms, of, a, m, scutellata, following, this, accidental, release, the, africanized, honey, bee, swarms, spread, out, and, crossbred, with, local, european, honey, bee, colonies, the, descendants, of, these, colonies, have, since, spread, throughout, the, americas, moving, through, the, amazon, basin, in, the, 1970s, crossing, into, central, america, in, 1982, and, reaching, mexico, in, 1985, because, their, movement, through, these, regions, was, rapid, and, largely, unassisted, by, humans, africanized, honey, bees, have, earned, the, reputation, of, being, a, notorious, invasive, species, the, prospect, of, killer, bees, arriving, in, the, united, states, caused, a, media, sensation, in, the, late, 1970s, inspired, several, horror, movies, and, sparked, debate, about, the, wisdom, of, humans, altering, entire, ecosystems, the, first, africanized, honey, bees, in, the, u, s, were, discovered, in, 1985, at, an, oil, field, in, the, san, joaquin, valley, of, california, bee, experts, theorized, the, colony, had, not, traveled, overland, but, instead, arrived, hidden, in, a, load, of, oil, drilling, pipe, shipped, from, south, america, the, first, permanent, colonies, arrived, in, texas, from, mexico, in, 1990, in, the, tucson, region, of, arizona, a, study, of, trapped, swarms, in, 1994, found, that, only, 15, percent, had, been, africanized, this, number, had, grown, to, 90, percent, by, 1997, though, africanized, honey, bees, display, certain, behavioral, traits, that, make, them, less, than, desirable, for, commercial, beekeeping, excessive, defensiveness, and, swarming, foremost, they, have, now, become, the, dominant, type, of, honey, bee, for, beekeeping, in, central, and, south, america, due, to, their, genetic, dominance, as, well, as, ability, to, out, compete, their, european, counterpart, with, some, beekeepers, asserting, that, they, are, superior, honey, producers, and, pollinators, africanized, honey, bees, as, opposed, to, other, western, bee, types, africanized, honey, bees, are, considered, an, invasive, species, in, the, americas, as, of, 2002, the, africanized, honey, bees, had, spread, from, brazil, south, to, northern, argentina, and, north, to, central, america, trinidad, the, west, indies, mexico, texas, arizona, nevada, new, mexico, florida, and, southern, california, in, june, 2005, it, was, discovered, that, the, bees, had, spread, into, southwest, arkansas, their, expansion, stopped, for, a, time, at, eastern, texas, possibly, due, to, the, large, population, of, european, honey, bee, hives, in, the, area, however, discoveries, of, the, africanized, honey, bees, in, southern, louisiana, show, that, they, have, gotten, past, this, barrier, or, have, come, as, a, swarm, aboard, a, ship, on, 11, september, 2007, commissioner, bob, odom, of, the, louisiana, department, of, agriculture, and, forestry, said, that, africanized, honey, bees, had, established, themselves, in, the, new, orleans, area, in, february, 2009, africanized, honey, bees, were, found, in, southern, utah, the, bees, had, spread, into, eight, counties, in, utah, as, far, north, as, grand, and, emery, counties, by, may, 2017, in, october, 2010, a, 73, year, old, man, was, killed, by, a, swarm, of, africanized, honey, bees, while, clearing, brush, on, his, south, georgia, property, as, determined, by, georgia, s, department, of, agriculture, in, 2012, tennessee, state, officials, reported, that, a, colony, was, found, for, the, first, time, in, a, beekeeper, s, colony, in, monroe, county, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, state, in, june, 2013, 62, year, old, larry, goodwin, of, moody, texas, was, killed, by, a, swarm, of, africanized, honey, bees, in, may, 2014, colorado, state, university, confirmed, that, bees, from, a, swarm, which, had, aggressively, attacked, an, orchardist, near, palisade, in, west, central, colorado, were, from, an, africanized, honey, bee, hive, the, hive, was, subsequently, destroyed, in, tropical, climates, they, effectively, out, compete, european, honey, bees, and, at, their, peak, rate, of, expansion, they, spread, north, at, almost, two, kilometers, about, 1, mile, a, day, there, were, discussions, about, slowing, the, spread, by, placing, large, numbers, of, docile, european, strain, hives, in, strategic, locations, particularly, at, the, isthmus, of, panama, but, various, national, and, international, agricultural, departments, could, not, prevent, the, bees, expansion, current, knowledge, of, the, genetics, of, these, bees, suggests, that, such, a, strategy, had, it, been, tried, would, not, have, been, successful, as, the, africanized, honey, bee, migrates, further, north, colonies, continue, to, interbreed, with, european, honey, bees, in, a, study, conducted, in, arizona, in, 2004, it, was, observed, that, swarms, of, africanized, honey, bees, could, take, over, weakened, european, honey, bee, hives, by, invading, the, hive, then, killing, the, european, queen, and, establishing, their, own, queen, there, are, now, relatively, stable, geographic, zones, in, which, either, africanized, honey, bees, dominate, a, mix, of, africanized, and, european, honey, bees, is, present, or, only, non, africanized, honey, bees, are, found, as, in, the, southern, portions, of, south, america, or, northern, north, america, african, honey, bees, abscond, abandon, the, hive, and, any, food, store, to, start, over, in, a, new, location, more, readily, than, european, honeybees, this, is, not, necessarily, a, severe, loss, in, tropical, climates, where, plants, bloom, all, year, but, in, more, temperate, climates, it, can, leave, the, colony, with, not, enough, stores, to, survive, the, winter, thus, africanized, honey, bees, are, expected, to, be, a, hazard, mostly, in, the, southern, states, of, the, united, states, reaching, as, far, north, as, the, chesapeake, bay, in, the, east, the, cold, weather, limits, of, the, africanized, honey, bee, have, driven, some, professional, bee, breeders, from, southern, california, into, the, harsher, wintering, locales, of, the, northern, sierra, nevada, and, southern, cascade, range, this, is, a, more, difficult, area, to, prepare, bees, for, early, pollination, placement, in, such, as, is, required, for, the, production, of, almonds, the, reduced, available, winter, forage, in, northern, california, means, that, bees, must, be, fed, for, early, spring, buildup, the, arrival, of, the, africanized, honey, bee, in, central, america, is, threatening, the, traditional, craft, of, keeping, melipona, stingless, bees, in, log, gums, although, they, do, not, interbreed, or, directly, compete, with, each, other, the, honey, production, from, an, individual, hive, of, africanized, honey, bees, can, be, as, high, as, 100, kilograms, 220, lb, this, value, exceeds, the, much, smaller, 3, 5, kilograms, 7, 11, lb, of, the, various, melipona, stingless, bee, species, thus, economic, pressures, are, forcing, beekeepers, to, switch, from, the, traditional, stingless, bees, to, the, new, reality, of, the, africanized, honey, bee, whether, this, will, lead, to, the, extinction, of, the, former, is, unknown, but, they, are, well, adapted, to, exist, in, the, wild, and, there, are, a, number, of, indigenous, plants, that, the, africanized, honey, bees, do, not, visit, so, the, fate, of, the, melipona, bees, remains, to, be, seen, africanized, honey, bees, begin, foraging, at, young, ages, and, harvest, a, greater, quantity, of, pollen, compared, to, their, european, counterparts, apis, mellifera, ligustica, this, may, be, linked, to, the, high, reproductive, rate, of, the, africanized, honey, bee, which, requires, pollen, to, feed, its, greater, number, of, larvae, africanized, honey, bees, are, also, sensitive, to, sucrose, at, lower, concentrations, this, adaptation, causes, foragers, to, harvest, resources, with, low, concentrations, of, sucrose, that, include, water, pollen, and, unconcentrated, nectar, a, study, comparing, a, m, scutellata, and, a, m, ligustica, published, by, fewell, and, bertram, in, 2002, suggests, that, the, differential, evolution, of, this, suite, of, behaviors, is, due, to, the, different, environmental, pressures, experienced, by, african, and, european, subspecies, honey, bee, sensitivity, to, different, concentrations, of, sucrose, is, determined, by, a, reflex, known, as, the, proboscis, extension, response, per, different, species, of, honey, bees, that, employ, different, foraging, behaviors, will, vary, in, the, concentration, of, sucrose, that, elicits, their, proboscis, extension, response, for, example, european, honey, bees, apis, mellifera, ligustica, forage, at, older, ages, and, harvest, less, pollen, and, more, concentrated, nectar, the, differences, in, resources, collected, during, harvesting, are, a, result, of, the, european, honey, bee, s, sensitivity, to, sucrose, at, higher, concentrations, the, differences, in, a, variety, of, behaviors, between, different, species, of, honey, bees, are, the, result, of, a, directional, selection, that, acts, upon, several, foraging, behavior, traits, as, a, common, entity, selection, in, natural, populations, of, honey, bees, show, that, positive, selection, of, sensitivity, to, low, concentrations, of, sucrose, are, linked, to, foraging, at, younger, ages, and, collecting, resources, low, in, sucrose, positive, selection, of, sensitivity, to, high, concentrations, of, sucrose, were, linked, to, foraging, at, older, ages, and, collecting, resources, higher, in, sucrose, additionally, of, interest, change, in, one, component, of, a, suite, of, behaviors, appear, to, direct, change, in, the, entire, suite, when, resource, density, is, low, in, africanized, honey, bee, habitats, it, is, necessary, for, the, bees, to, harvest, a, greater, variety, of, resources, because, they, cannot, afford, to, be, selective, honey, bees, that, are, genetically, inclined, towards, resources, high, in, sucrose, such, as, concentrated, nectar, will, not, be, able, to, sustain, themselves, in, harsher, environments, the, noted, proboscis, extension, response, to, low, sucrose, concentration, in, africanized, honey, bees, may, be, a, result, of, selective, pressure, in, times, of, scarcity, when, their, survival, depends, on, their, attraction, to, low, quality, resources, the, popular, term, killer, bee, has, only, limited, scientific, meaning, today, because, there, is, no, generally, accepted, fraction, of, genetic, contribution, used, to, establish, a, cut, off, between, a, killer, honey, bee, and, an, ordinary, honey, bee, government, and, scientific, documents, prefer, africanized, honey, bee, as, an, accepted, scientific, taxon, although, the, native, east, african, lowland, honey, bees, apis, mellifera, scutellata, are, smaller, and, build, smaller, comb, cells, than, the, european, honey, bees, their, hybrids, are, not, smaller, africanized, honey, bees, have, slightly, shorter, wings, which, can, only, be, recognized, reliably, by, performing, a, statistical, analysis, on, micro, measurements, of, a, substantial, sample, one, of, the, problems, with, this, test, is, that, there, are, other, subspecies, such, as, a, m, iberiensis, which, also, have, shortened, wings, this, trait, is, hypothesized, to, derive, from, ancient, hybrid, haplotypes, thought, to, have, links, to, evolutionary, lineages, from, africa, some, belong, to, a, m, intermissa, but, others, have, an, indeterminate, origin, the, egyptian, honeybee, apis, mellifera, lamarckii, present, in, small, numbers, in, the, southeastern, u, s, has, the, same, morphology, currently, testing, techniques, have, moved, away, from, external, measurements, to, dna, analysis, but, this, means, the, test, can, only, be, done, by, a, sophisticated, laboratory, molecular, diagnostics, using, the, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, cytochrome, b, gene, can, differentiate, a, m, scutellata, from, other, a, mellifera, lineages, though, mtdna, only, allows, one, to, detect, africanized, colonies, that, have, africanized, queens, and, not, colonies, where, a, european, queen, has, mated, with, africanized, drones, a, test, based, on, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, was, created, in, 2015, to, detect, africanized, bees, based, on, the, proportion, of, african, and, european, ancestry, the, western, honey, bee, is, native, to, the, continents, of, europe, asia, and, africa, as, of, the, early, 1600s, it, was, introduced, to, north, america, with, subsequent, introductions, of, other, european, subspecies, 200, years, later, since, then, they, have, spread, throughout, the, americas, the, 29, subspecies, can, be, assigned, to, one, of, four, major, branches, based, on, work, by, ruttner, and, subsequently, confirmed, by, analysis, of, mitochondrial, dna, african, subspecies, are, assigned, to, branch, a, northwestern, european, subspecies, to, branch, m, southwestern, european, subspecies, to, branch, c, and, mideast, subspecies, to, branch, o, the, subspecies, are, grouped, and, listed, there, are, still, regions, with, localized, variations, that, may, become, identified, subspecies, in, the, near, future, such, as, a, m, pomonella, from, the, tian, shan, mountains, which, would, be, included, in, the, mideast, subspecies, branch, the, western, honey, bee, is, the, third, insect, whose, genome, has, been, mapped, and, is, unusual, in, having, very, few, transposons, according, to, the, scientists, who, analyzed, its, genetic, code, the, western, honey, bee, originated, in, africa, and, spread, to, eurasia, in, two, ancient, migrations, they, have, also, discovered, that, the, number, of, genes, in, the, honey, bee, related, to, smell, outnumber, those, for, taste, the, genome, sequence, revealed, several, groups, of, genes, particularly, the, genes, related, to, circadian, rhythms, were, closer, to, vertebrates, than, other, insects, genes, related, to, enzymes, that, control, other, genes, were, also, vertebrate, like, there, are, two, lineages, of, the, east, african, lowland, subspecies, apis, mellifera, scutellata, in, the, americas, actual, matrilineal, descendants, of, the, original, escaped, queens, and, a, much, smaller, number, that, are, africanized, through, hybridization, the, matrilineal, descendants, carry, african, mtdna, but, partially, european, nuclear, dna, while, the, honey, bees, that, are, africanized, through, hybridization, carry, european, mtdna, and, partially, african, nuclear, dna, the, matrilineal, descendants, are, in, the, vast, majority, this, is, supported, by, dna, analyses, performed, on, the, bees, as, they, spread, northwards, those, that, were, at, the, vanguard, were, over, 90, african, mtdna, indicating, an, unbroken, matriline, but, after, several, years, in, residence, in, an, area, interbreeding, with, the, local, european, strains, as, in, brazil, the, overall, representation, of, african, mtdna, drops, to, some, degree, however, these, latter, hybrid, lines, with, european, mtdna, do, not, appear, to, propagate, themselves, well, or, persist, population, genetics, analysis, of, africanized, honey, bees, in, the, united, states, using, a, maternally, inherited, genetic, marker, found, 12, distinct, mitotypes, and, the, amount, of, genetic, variation, observed, supports, the, idea, that, there, have, been, multiple, introductions, of, ahb, into, the, united, states, a, newer, publication, shows, the, genetic, admixture, of, the, africanized, honey, bees, in, brazil, the, small, number, of, honey, bees, with, african, ancestry, that, were, introduced, to, brazil, in, 1956, which, dispersed, and, hybridized, with, existing, managed, populations, of, european, origin, and, quickly, spread, across, much, of, the, americas, is, an, example, of, a, massive, biological, invasion, as, earlier, told, in, this, article, here, they, analysed, whole, genome, sequences, of, 32, africanized, honey, bees, sampled, from, throughout, brazil, to, study, the, effect, of, this, process, on, genome, diversity, by, comparison, with, ancestral, populations, from, europe, and, africa, they, infer, that, these, samples, had, 84, african, ancestry, with, the, remainder, from, western, european, populations, however, this, proportion, varied, across, the, genome, and, they, identified, signals, of, positive, selection, in, regions, with, high, european, ancestry, proportions, these, observations, are, largely, driven, by, one, large, gene, rich, 1, 4, mbp, segment, on, chromosome, 11, where, european, haplotypes, are, present, at, a, significantly, elevated, frequency, and, likely, confer, an, adaptive, advantage, in, the, africanized, honey, bee, population, the, chief, difference, between, the, european, subspecies, of, honey, bees, kept, by, beekeepers, and, the, african, ones, is, attributable, to, both, selective, breeding, and, natural, selection, by, selecting, only, the, most, gentle, non, defensive, subspecies, beekeepers, have, over, centuries, eliminated, the, more, defensive, ones, and, created, a, number, of, subspecies, suitable, for, apiculture, in, central, and, southern, africa, there, was, formerly, no, tradition, of, beekeeping, and, the, hive, was, destroyed, in, order, to, harvest, the, honey, pollen, and, larvae, the, bees, adapted, to, the, climate, of, sub, saharan, africa, including, prolonged, droughts, having, to, defend, themselves, against, aggressive, insects, such, as, ants, and, wasps, as, well, as, voracious, animals, like, the, honey, badger, african, honey, bees, evolved, as, a, subspecies, group, of, highly, defensive, bees, unsuitable, by, a, number, of, metrics, for, domestic, use, as, africanized, honey, bees, migrate, into, regions, hives, with, an, old, or, absent, queen, can, become, hybridized, by, crossbreeding, the, aggressive, africanized, drones, out, compete, european, drones, for, a, newly, developed, queen, of, such, a, hive, ultimately, resulting, in, hybridization, of, the, existing, colony, requeening, a, term, for, replacing, out, the, older, existing, queen, with, a, new, already, fertilized, one, can, avoid, hybridization, in, apiaries, as, a, prophylactic, measure, the, majority, of, beekeepers, in, north, america, tend, to, requeen, their, hives, annually, maintaining, strong, colonies, and, avoiding, hybridization, africanized, honey, bees, exhibit, far, greater, defensiveness, than, european, honey, bees, and, are, more, likely, to, deal, with, a, perceived, threat, by, attacking, in, large, swarms, these, hybrids, have, been, known, to, pursue, a, perceived, threat, for, a, distance, of, well, over, 500, meters, 1, 640, ft, the, venom, of, an, africanized, honey, bee, is, the, same, as, that, of, a, european, honey, bee, but, since, the, former, tends, to, sting, in, far, greater, numbers, deaths, from, them, are, naturally, more, numerous, than, from, european, honey, bees, while, allergies, to, the, european, honey, bee, may, cause, death, complications, from, africanized, honey, bee, stings, are, usually, not, caused, from, allergies, to, their, venom, humans, stung, many, times, by, the, africanized, honey, bees, can, exhibit, serious, side, effects, such, as, inflammation, of, the, skin, dizziness, headaches, weakness, edema, nausea, diarrhea, and, vomiting, some, cases, even, progress, to, affecting, different, body, systems, by, causing, increased, heart, rates, respiratory, distress, and, even, renal, failure, africanized, honey, bee, sting, cases, can, become, very, serious, but, they, remain, relatively, rare, and, are, often, limited, to, accidental, discovery, in, highly, populated, areas, the, africanized, honey, bee, is, widely, feared, by, the, public, a, reaction, that, has, been, amplified, by, sensationalist, movies, such, as, the, swarm, and, some, of, the, media, reports, stings, from, africanized, honey, bees, kill, on, average, two, or, three, people, per, year, as, the, africanized, honey, bee, spreads, through, florida, a, densely, populated, state, officials, worry, that, public, fear, may, force, misguided, efforts, to, combat, them, news, reports, of, mass, stinging, attacks, will, promote, concern, and, in, some, cases, panic, and, anxiety, and, cause, citizens, to, demand, responsible, agencies, and, organizations, to, take, action, to, help, ensure, their, safety, we, anticipate, increased, pressure, from, the, public, to, ban, beekeeping, in, urban, and, suburban, areas, this, action, would, be, counter, productive, beekeepers, maintaining, managed, colonies, of, domestic, european, bees, are, our, best, defense, against, an, area, becoming, saturated, with, ahb, these, managed, bees, are, filling, an, ecological, niche, that, would, soon, be, occupied, by, less, desirable, colonies, if, it, were, vacant, killer, bee, is, a, term, frequently, used, in, media, such, as, movies, that, portray, aggressive, behavior, or, actively, seeking, to, attack, humans, africanized, honey, bee, is, considered, a, more, descriptive, term, in, part, because, their, behavior, is, increased, defensiveness, compared, to, european, honey, bees, that, can, exhibit, similar, defensive, behaviors, when, disturbed, the, sting, of, the, africanized, honey, bee, is, no, more, potent, than, any, other, variety, of, honey, bee, and, although, they, are, similar, in, appearance, to, european, honey, bees, they, tend, to, be, slightly, smaller, and, darker, in, color, although, africanized, honey, bees, do, not, actively, search, for, humans, to, attack, they, are, more, dangerous, because, they, are, more, easily, provoked, quicker, to, attack, in, greater, numbers, and, then, pursue, the, perceived, threat, farther, for, as, much, as, a, quarter, of, a, mile, 400, metres, while, studies, have, shown, that, africanized, honey, bees, can, infiltrate, european, honey, bee, colonies, and, then, kill, and, replace, their, queen, thus, usurping, the, hive, this, is, less, common, than, other, methods, wild, and, managed, colonies, will, sometimes, be, seen, to, fight, over, honey, stores, during, the, dearth, periods, when, plants, are, not, flowering, but, this, behavior, should, not, be, confused, with, the, aforementioned, activity, the, most, common, way, that, a, european, honey, bee, hive, will, become, africanized, is, through, crossbreeding, during, a, new, queen, s, mating, flight, studies, have, consistently, shown, that, africanized, drones, are, more, numerous, stronger, and, faster, than, their, european, cousins, and, are, therefore, able, to, out, compete, them, during, these, mating, flights, the, result, of, mating, between, africanized, drones, and, european, queens, is, almost, always, africanized, offspring, in, areas, of, suitable, temperate, climate, the, survival, traits, of, africanized, honey, bee, colonies, help, them, outperform, european, honey, bee, colonies, they, also, return, later, and, work, under, conditions, that, often, keep, european, honey, bees, hive, bound, this, is, the, reason, why, they, have, gained, a, reputation, as, superior, honey, producers, and, those, beekeepers, who, have, learned, to, adapt, their, management, techniques, now, seem, to, prefer, them, to, their, european, counterparts, studies, show, that, in, areas, of, florida, that, contain, africanized, honey, bees, the, honey, production, is, higher, than, in, areas, in, which, they, do, not, live, it, is, also, becoming, apparent, that, africanized, honey, bees, have, another, advantage, over, european, honey, bees, in, that, they, seem, to, show, a, higher, resistance, to, several, health, issues, including, parasites, such, as, varroa, destructor, some, fungal, diseases, like, chalkbrood, and, even, the, mysterious, colony, collapse, disorder, which, was, plaguing, beekeepers, in, the, early, 2000, s, despite, all, its, negative, factors, it, is, possible, that, the, africanized, honey, bee, might, actually, end, up, being, a, boon, to, apiculture, in, areas, where, africanized, honey, bees, are, well, established, bought, and, pre, fertilized, i, e, mated, european, queens, can, be, used, to, maintain, a, hive, s, european, genetics, and, behavior, however, this, practice, can, be, expensive, since, these, queens, must, be, bought, and, shipped, from, breeder, apiaries, in, areas, completely, free, of, africanized, honey, bees, such, as, the, northern, u, s, states, or, hawaii, as, such, this, is, generally, not, practical, for, most, commercial, beekeepers, outside, the, u, s, and, it, is, one, of, the, main, reasons, why, central, and, south, american, beekeepers, have, had, to, learn, to, manage, and, work, with, the, existing, africanized, honey, bee, any, effort, to, crossbreed, virgin, european, queens, with, africanized, drones, will, result, in, the, offspring, exhibiting, africanized, traits, only, 26, swarms, escaped, in, 1957, and, nearly, 60, years, later, there, does, not, appear, to, be, a, noticeable, lessening, of, the, typical, africanized, characteristics, not, all, africanized, honey, bee, hives, display, the, typical, hyper, defensive, behavior, which, may, provide, bee, breeders, a, point, to, begin, breeding, a, gentler, stock, gahbs, work, has, been, done, in, brazil, towards, this, end, but, in, order, to, maintain, these, traits, it, is, necessary, to, develop, a, queen, breeding, and, mating, facility, in, order, to, requeen, colonies, and, to, prevent, reintroduction, of, unwanted, genes, or, characteristics, through, unintended, crossbreeding, with, feral, colonies, in, puerto, rico, some, bee, colonies, are, already, beginning, to, show, more, gentle, behavior, this, is, believed, to, be, because, the, more, gentle, bees, contain, genetic, material, that, is, more, similar, to, the, european, honey, bee, although, they, also, contain, africanized, honey, bee, material, this, degree, of, aggressiveness, is, surprisingly, almost, unrelated, to, individual, genetics, instead, being, almost, entirely, determined, by, the, entire, hive, s, proportion, of, aggression, genetics, while, bee, incidents, are, much, less, common, than, they, were, during, the, first, wave, of, africanized, honey, bee, colonization, this, can, be, largely, attributed, to, modified, and, improved, bee, management, techniques, prominent, among, these, are, locating, bee, yards, much, farther, away, from, human, habitation, creating, barriers, to, keep, livestock, at, enough, of, a, distance, to, prevent, interaction, and, education, of, the, general, public, to, teach, them, how, to, properly, react, when, feral, colonies, are, encountered, and, what, resources, to, contact, the, africanized, honey, bee, is, now, considered, the, honey, bee, of, choice, for, beekeeping, in, brazil, africanized, honey, bees, are, a, threat, to, outdoor, pets, especially, mammals, the, most, detailed, information, available, pertains, to, dogs, less, is, known, about, livestock, as, victims, there, is, a, widespread, consensus, that, cattle, suffer, occasional, africanized, honey, bee, attacks, in, brazil, but, there, is, little, relevant, documentation, it, appears, that, cows, sustain, hundreds, of, stings, if, they, are, attacked, but, can, survive, such, injuries
