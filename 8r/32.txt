paranthropus, is, a, genus, of, extinct, hominin, which, contains, two, widely, accepted, species, p, robustus, and, p, boisei, however, the, validity, of, paranthropus, is, contested, and, it, is, sometimes, considered, to, be, synonymous, with, australopithecus, they, are, also, referred, to, as, the, robust, australopithecines, they, lived, between, approximately, 2, 9, and, 1, 2, million, years, ago, mya, from, the, end, of, the, pliocene, to, the, middle, pleistocene, paranthropus, is, characterised, by, robust, skulls, with, a, prominent, gorilla, like, sagittal, crest, along, the, midline, which, suggest, strong, chewing, muscles, and, broad, herbivorous, teeth, used, for, grinding, however, they, likely, preferred, soft, food, over, tough, and, hard, food, typically, paranthropus, species, were, generalist, feeders, but, while, p, robustus, was, likely, an, omnivore, p, boisei, seems, to, have, been, herbivorous, possibly, preferring, abundant, bulbotubers, paranthropoids, were, bipeds, despite, their, robust, heads, they, had, comparatively, small, bodies, average, weight, and, height, are, estimated, to, be, 40, kg, 88, lb, at, 132, cm, 4, ft, for, p, robustus, males, 50, kg, 110, lb, at, 137, cm, 4, ft, 6, in, for, p, boisei, males, 32, kg, 71, lb, at, 110, cm, 3, ft, 7, in, for, p, robustus, females, and, 34, kg, 75, lb, at, 124, cm, 4, ft, 1, in, for, p, boisei, females, they, were, possibly, polygamous, and, patrilocal, but, there, are, no, modern, analogues, for, australopithecine, societies, they, are, associated, with, bone, tools, and, contested, as, the, earliest, evidence, of, fire, usage, they, typically, inhabited, woodlands, and, coexisted, with, some, early, human, species, namely, a, africanus, h, habilis, and, h, erectus, they, were, preyed, upon, by, the, large, carnivores, of, the, time, specifically, crocodiles, leopards, sabertoothed, cats, and, hyenas, the, genus, paranthropus, was, first, erected, by, scottish, south, african, palaeontologist, robert, broom, in, 1938, with, the, type, species, p, robustus, paranthropus, derives, from, ancient, greek, para, beside, or, alongside, and, nthropos, man, the, type, specimen, a, male, braincase, tm, 1517, was, discovered, by, schoolboy, gert, terblanche, at, the, kromdraai, fossil, site, about, 70, km, 43, mi, southwest, of, pretoria, south, africa, by, 1988, at, least, six, individuals, were, unearthed, in, around, the, same, area, now, known, as, the, cradle, of, humankind, in, 1948, at, swartkrans, cave, in, about, the, same, vicinity, as, kromdraai, broom, and, south, african, palaeontologist, john, talbot, robinson, described, p, crassidens, based, on, a, subadult, jaw, sk, 6, he, believed, later, paranthropus, were, morphologically, distinct, from, earlier, paranthropus, in, the, cave, that, is, the, swartkrans, paranthropus, were, reproductively, isolated, from, kromdraai, paranthropus, and, the, former, eventually, speciated, by, 1988, several, specimens, from, swartkrans, had, been, placed, into, p, crassidens, however, this, has, since, been, synonymised, with, p, robustus, as, the, two, populations, do, not, seem, to, be, very, distinct, in, 1959, p, boisei, was, discovered, by, mary, leakey, at, olduvai, gorge, tanzania, specimen, oh, 5, her, husband, louis, named, it, zinjanthropus, boisei, because, he, believed, it, differed, greatly, from, paranthropus, and, australopithecus, the, name, derives, from, zinj, an, ancient, arabic, word, for, the, coast, of, east, africa, and, boisei, referring, to, their, financial, benefactor, charles, watson, boise, however, this, genus, was, rejected, at, mr, leakey, s, presentation, before, the, 4th, pan, african, congress, on, prehistory, as, it, was, based, on, a, single, specimen, the, discovery, of, the, peninj, mandible, made, the, leakeys, reclassify, their, species, as, australopithecus, zinjanthropus, boisei, in, 1964, but, in, 1967, south, african, palaeoanthropologist, phillip, v, tobias, subsumed, it, into, australopithecus, as, a, boisei, however, as, more, specimens, were, found, the, combination, paranthropus, boisei, became, more, popular, it, is, debated, whether, the, wide, range, of, variation, in, jaw, size, indicates, simply, sexual, dimorphism, or, a, grounds, for, identifying, a, new, species, it, could, be, explained, as, groundmass, filling, in, cracks, naturally, formed, after, death, inflating, the, perceived, size, of, the, bone, p, boisei, also, has, a, notably, wide, range, of, variation, in, skull, anatomy, but, these, features, likely, have, no, taxonomic, bearing, in, 1968, french, palaeontologists, camille, arambourg, and, yves, coppens, described, paraustralopithecus, aethiopicus, based, on, a, toothless, mandible, from, the, shungura, formation, ethiopia, omo, 18, in, 1976, american, anthropologist, francis, clark, howell, and, breton, anthropologist, yves, coppens, reclassified, it, as, a, africanus, in, 1986, after, the, discovery, of, the, skull, knm, wt, 17000, by, english, anthropologist, alan, walker, and, richard, leakey, classified, it, into, paranthropus, as, p, aethiopicus, there, is, debate, whether, this, is, synonymous, with, p, boisei, the, main, argument, for, separation, being, the, skull, seems, less, adapted, for, chewing, tough, vegetation, in, 1989, palaeoartist, and, zoologist, walter, ferguson, reclassified, knm, wt, 17000, into, a, new, species, walkeri, because, he, considered, the, skull, s, species, designation, questionable, as, it, comprised, the, skull, whereas, the, holotype, of, p, aethiopicus, comprised, only, the, mandible, ferguson, s, classification, is, almost, universally, ignored, and, is, considered, to, be, synonymous, with, p, aethiopicus, in, 2015, ethiopian, palaeoanthropologist, yohannes, haile, selassie, and, colleagues, described, the, 3, 5, 3, 2, ma, a, deyiremeda, based, on, three, jawbones, from, the, afar, region, ethiopia, they, noted, that, though, it, shares, many, similarities, with, paranthropus, it, may, not, have, been, closely, related, because, it, lacked, enlarged, molars, which, characterize, the, genus, nonetheless, in, 2018, independent, researcher, johan, nygren, recommended, moving, it, to, paranthropus, based, on, dental, and, presumed, dietary, similarity, in, 1951, american, anthropologists, sherwood, washburn, and, bruce, d, patterson, were, the, first, to, suggest, that, paranthropus, should, be, considered, a, junior, synonym, of, australopithecus, as, the, former, was, only, known, from, fragmentary, remains, at, the, time, and, dental, differences, were, too, minute, to, serve, as, justification, in, face, of, calls, for, subsumation, leakey, and, robinson, continued, defending, its, validity, various, other, authors, were, still, unsure, until, more, complete, remains, were, found, paranthropus, is, sometimes, classified, as, a, subgenus, of, australopithecus, there, is, currently, no, clear, consensus, on, the, validity, of, paranthropus, the, argument, rests, upon, whether, the, genus, is, monophyletic, is, composed, of, a, common, ancestor, and, all, of, its, descendants, and, the, argument, against, monophyly, that, the, genus, is, paraphyletic, says, that, p, robustus, and, p, boisei, evolved, similar, gorilla, like, heads, independently, of, each, other, by, coincidence, convergent, evolution, as, chewing, adaptations, in, hominins, evolve, very, rapidly, and, multiple, times, at, various, points, in, the, family, tree, homoplasy, in, 1999, a, chimp, like, ulna, forearm, bone, was, assigned, to, p, boisei, the, first, discovered, ulna, of, the, species, which, was, markedly, different, from, p, robustus, ulnae, which, could, suggest, paraphyly, p, aethiopicus, is, the, earliest, member, of, the, genus, with, the, oldest, remains, from, the, ethiopian, omo, kibish, formation, dated, to, 2, 6, mya, at, the, end, of, the, pliocene, it, is, sometimes, regarded, as, the, direct, ancestor, of, p, boisei, and, p, robustus, it, is, possible, that, p, aethiopicus, evolved, even, earlier, up, to, 3, 3, mya, on, the, expansive, kenyan, floodplains, of, the, time, the, oldest, p, boisei, remains, date, to, about, 2, 3, mya, from, malema, malawi, p, boisei, changed, remarkably, little, over, its, nearly, one, million, year, existence, paranthropus, had, spread, into, south, africa, by, 2, mya, with, the, earliest, p, robustus, remains, it, is, sometimes, suggested, that, paranthropus, and, homo, are, sister, taxa, both, evolving, from, australopithecus, this, may, have, occurred, during, a, drying, trend, 2, 8, 2, 5, mya, in, the, great, rift, valley, which, caused, the, retreat, of, woodland, environments, in, favor, of, open, savanna, with, forests, growing, only, along, rivers, and, lakes, homo, evolved, in, the, former, and, paranthropus, in, the, latter, riparian, environment, however, the, classifications, of, australopithecus, species, is, problematic, evolutionary, tree, according, to, a, 2019, study, chimpanzee, ardipithecus, a, afarensis, p, aethiopicus, p, boisei, p, robustus, a, africanus, h, floresiensis, a, sediba, h, habilis, other, homo, paranthropus, had, a, massively, built, tall, and, flat, skull, with, a, prominent, gorilla, like, sagittal, crest, along, the, midline, which, anchored, large, temporalis, muscles, used, in, chewing, like, other, australopithecines, paranthropus, exhibited, sexual, dimorphism, with, males, notably, larger, than, females, they, had, large, molars, with, a, relatively, thick, tooth, enamel, coating, post, canine, megadontia, and, comparatively, small, incisors, similar, in, size, to, modern, humans, possibly, adaptations, to, processing, abrasive, foods, the, teeth, of, p, aethiopicus, developed, faster, than, those, of, p, boisei, paranthropus, had, adaptations, to, the, skull, to, resist, large, bite, loads, while, feeding, namely, the, expansive, squamosal, sutures, the, notably, thick, palate, was, once, thought, to, have, been, an, adaptation, to, resist, a, high, bite, force, but, is, better, explained, as, a, byproduct, of, facial, lengthening, and, nasal, anatomy, in, p, boisei, the, jaw, hinge, was, adapted, to, grinding, food, side, to, side, rather, than, up, and, down, in, modern, humans, which, is, better, at, processing, the, starchy, abrasive, foods, that, likely, made, up, the, bulk, of, its, diet, p, robustus, may, have, chewed, in, a, front, to, back, direction, instead, and, had, less, exaggerated, less, derived, anatomical, features, than, p, boisei, as, it, perhaps, did, not, require, them, with, this, kind, of, chewing, strategy, this, may, have, also, allowed, p, robustus, to, better, process, tougher, foods, the, braincase, volume, averaged, about, 500, cm, 3, 31, cu, in, comparable, to, gracile, australopithecines, but, smaller, than, homo, modern, human, brain, volume, averages, 1, 270, cm, 3, 78, cu, in, for, men, and, 1, 130, cm, 3, 69, cu, in, for, women, unlike, p, robustus, the, forearms, of, p, boisei, were, heavily, built, which, might, suggest, habitual, suspensory, behaviour, as, in, orangutans, and, gibbons, a, p, boisei, shoulder, blade, indicates, long, infraspinatus, muscles, which, is, also, associated, with, suspensory, behavior, a, p, aethiopicus, ulna, on, the, other, hand, shows, more, similarities, to, homo, than, p, boisei, paranthropus, were, bipeds, and, their, hips, legs, and, feet, resemble, a, afarensis, and, modern, humans, the, pelvis, is, similar, to, a, afarensis, but, the, hip, joints, are, smaller, in, p, robustus, the, physical, similarity, implies, a, similar, walking, gait, their, modern, humanlike, big, toe, indicates, a, modern, humanlike, foot, posture, and, range, of, motion, but, the, more, distal, ankle, joint, would, have, inhibited, the, modern, human, toe, off, gait, cycle, by, 1, 8, mya, paranthropus, and, h, habilis, may, have, achieved, about, the, same, grade, of, bipedality, in, comparison, to, the, large, robust, head, the, body, was, rather, small, average, weight, for, p, robustus, may, have, been, 40, kg, 88, lb, for, males, and, 32, kg, 71, lb, for, females, and, for, p, boisei, 50, kg, 110, lb, for, males, and, 34, kg, 75, lb, for, females, at, swartkrans, cave, members, 1, and, 2, about, 35, of, the, p, robustus, individuals, are, estimated, to, have, weighed, 28, kg, 62, lb, 22, about, 43, kg, 95, lb, and, the, remaining, 43, bigger, than, the, former, but, less, than, 54, kg, 119, lb, at, member, 3, all, individuals, were, about, 45, kg, 99, lb, female, weight, was, about, the, same, in, contemporaneous, h, erectus, but, male, h, erectus, were, on, average, 13, kg, 28, 7, lb, heavier, than, p, robustus, males, p, robustus, sites, are, oddly, dominated, by, small, adults, which, could, be, explained, as, heightened, predation, or, mortality, of, the, larger, males, of, a, group, the, largest, known, paranthropus, individual, was, estimated, at, 54, kg, 119, lb, according, to, a, 1991, study, based, on, femur, length, and, using, the, dimensions, of, modern, humans, male, and, female, p, robustus, are, estimated, to, have, stood, on, average, 132, and, 110, cm, 4, ft, 4, in, and, 3, ft, 7, in, respectively, and, p, boisei, 137, and, 124, cm, 4, ft, 6, in, and, 4, ft, 1, in, however, the, latter, estimates, are, problematic, as, there, were, no, positively, identified, male, p, boisei, femurs, at, the, time, in, 2013, a, 1, 34, ma, male, p, boisei, partial, skeleton, was, estimated, to, be, at, least, 156, cm, 5, ft, 1, in, and, 50, kg, 110, lb, paranthropus, seems, to, have, had, notably, high, rates, of, pitting, enamel, hypoplasia, peh, where, tooth, enamel, formation, is, spotty, instead, of, mostly, uniform, in, p, robustus, about, 47, of, baby, teeth, and, 14, of, adult, teeth, were, affected, in, comparison, to, about, 6, 7, and, 4, 3, respectively, in, any, other, tested, hominin, species, the, condition, of, these, holes, covering, the, entire, tooth, is, consistent, with, the, modern, human, ailment, amelogenesis, imperfecta, however, since, circular, holes, in, enamel, coverage, are, uniform, in, size, only, present, on, the, molar, teeth, and, have, the, same, severity, across, individuals, the, peh, may, have, been, a, genetic, condition, it, is, possible, that, the, coding, dna, concerned, with, thickening, enamel, also, left, them, more, vulnerable, to, peh, there, have, been, 10, identified, cases, of, cavities, in, p, robustus, indicating, a, rate, similar, to, modern, humans, a, molar, from, drimolen, south, africa, showed, a, cavity, on, the, tooth, root, a, rare, occurrence, in, fossil, great, apes, in, order, for, cavity, creating, bacteria, to, reach, this, area, the, individual, would, have, had, to, have, also, presented, either, alveolar, resportion, which, is, commonly, associated, with, gum, disease, or, super, eruption, of, teeth, which, occurs, when, teeth, become, worn, down, and, have, to, erupt, a, bit, more, in, order, to, maintain, a, proper, bite, and, this, exposed, the, root, the, latter, is, most, likely, and, the, exposed, root, seems, to, have, caused, hypercementosis, to, anchor, the, tooth, in, place, the, cavity, seems, to, have, been, healing, which, may, have, been, caused, by, a, change, in, diet, or, mouth, microbiome, or, the, loss, of, the, adjacent, molar, it, was, once, thought, p, boisei, cracked, open, nuts, with, its, powerful, teeth, giving, oh, 5, the, nickname, nutcracker, man, however, like, gorillas, paranthropus, likely, preferred, soft, foods, but, would, consume, tough, or, hard, food, during, leaner, times, and, the, powerful, jaws, were, used, only, in, the, latter, situation, in, p, boisei, thick, enamel, was, more, likely, used, to, resist, abrasive, gritty, particles, rather, than, to, minimize, chipping, while, eating, hard, foods, in, fact, there, is, a, distinct, lack, of, tooth, fractures, which, would, have, resulted, from, such, activity, paranthropus, were, generalist, feeders, but, diet, seems, to, have, ranged, dramatically, with, location, the, south, african, p, robustus, appears, to, have, been, an, omnivore, with, a, diet, similar, to, contemporaneous, homo, and, nearly, identical, to, the, later, h, ergaster, and, subsisted, on, mainly, c4, savanna, plants, and, c3, forest, plants, which, could, indicate, either, seasonal, shifts, in, diet, or, seasonal, migration, from, forest, to, savanna, in, leaner, times, it, may, have, fallen, back, on, brittle, food, it, likely, also, consumed, seeds, and, possibly, tubers, or, termites, a, high, cavity, rate, could, indicate, honey, consumption, the, east, african, p, boisei, on, the, other, hand, seems, to, have, been, largely, herbivorous, and, fed, on, c4, plants, its, powerful, jaws, allowed, it, to, consume, a, wide, variety, of, different, plants, though, it, may, have, largely, preferred, nutrient, rich, bulbotubers, as, these, are, known, to, thrive, in, the, well, watered, woodlands, it, is, thought, to, have, inhabited, feeding, on, these, p, boisei, may, have, been, able, to, meet, its, daily, caloric, requirements, of, approximately, 9, 700, kj, after, about, 6, hours, of, foraging, juvenile, p, robustus, may, have, relied, more, on, tubers, than, adults, given, the, elevated, levels, of, strontium, compared, to, adults, in, teeth, from, swartkrans, cave, which, in, the, area, was, most, likely, sourced, from, tubers, dentin, exposure, on, juvenile, teeth, could, indicate, early, weaning, or, a, more, abrasive, diet, than, adults, which, wore, away, the, cementum, and, enamel, coatings, or, both, it, is, also, possible, juveniles, were, less, capable, of, removing, grit, from, dug, up, food, rather, than, purposefully, seeking, out, more, abrasive, foods, oldowan, toolkits, were, uncovered, at, an, excavation, site, on, the, homa, peninsula, in, western, kenya, stone, tools, called, oldowan, toolkits, are, used, to, pound, and, shape, other, rocks, or, plant, materials, these, tools, are, thought, to, be, between, 2, 6, and, 3, million, years, old, the, stone, tools, were, found, near, paranthropus, teeth, bone, tools, dating, between, 2, 3, and, 0, 6, mya, have, been, found, in, abundance, in, swartkrans, kromdraai, and, drimolen, caves, and, are, often, associated, with, p, robustus, though, homo, is, also, known, from, these, caves, their, remains, are, comparatively, scarce, to, paranthropus, making, homo, attribution, unlikely, the, tools, also, cooccur, with, homo, associated, oldawan, and, possibly, acheulian, stone, tool, industries, the, bone, tools, were, typically, sourced, from, the, shaft, of, long, bones, from, medium, to, large, sized, mammals, but, tools, made, sourced, from, mandibles, ribs, and, horn, cores, have, also, been, found, bone, tools, have, also, been, found, at, oldawan, gorge, and, directly, associated, with, p, boisei, the, youngest, dating, to, 1, 34, mya, though, a, great, proportion, of, other, bone, tools, from, here, have, ambiguous, attribution, stone, tools, from, kromdraai, could, possibly, be, attributed, to, p, robustus, as, no, homo, have, been, found, there, yet, the, bone, tools, were, not, manufactured, or, purposefully, shaped, for, a, task, however, since, the, bones, display, no, weathering, and, were, not, scavenged, randomly, and, there, is, a, preference, displayed, for, certain, bones, raw, materials, were, likely, specifically, hand, picked, this, could, indicate, a, similar, cognitive, ability, to, contemporary, stone, age, homo, bone, tools, may, have, been, used, to, cut, or, process, vegetation, or, dig, up, tubers, or, termites, the, form, of, p, robustus, incisors, appear, to, be, intermediate, between, h, erectus, and, modern, humans, which, could, indicate, less, food, processing, done, by, the, teeth, due, to, preparation, with, simple, tools, burnt, bones, were, also, associated, with, the, inhabitants, of, swartkrans, which, could, indicate, some, of, the, earliest, fire, usage, however, these, bones, were, found, in, member, 3, where, paranthropus, remains, are, rarer, than, h, erectus, and, it, is, also, possible, the, bones, were, burned, in, a, wildfire, and, washed, into, the, cave, as, it, is, known, the, bones, were, not, burned, onsite, given, the, marked, anatomical, and, physical, differences, with, modern, great, apes, there, may, be, no, modern, analogue, for, australopithecine, societies, so, comparisons, drawn, with, modern, primates, will, not, be, entirely, accurate, paranthropus, had, pronounced, sexual, dimorphism, with, males, notably, larger, than, females, which, is, commonly, correlated, with, a, male, dominated, polygamous, society, p, robustus, may, have, had, a, harem, society, similar, to, modern, forest, dwelling, silverback, gorillas, where, one, male, has, exclusive, breeding, rights, to, a, group, of, females, as, male, female, size, disparity, is, comparable, to, gorillas, based, on, facial, dimensions, and, younger, males, were, less, robust, than, older, males, delayed, maturity, is, also, exhibited, in, gorillas, however, if, p, robustus, preferred, a, savanna, habitat, a, multi, male, society, would, have, been, more, productive, to, better, defend, the, troop, from, predators, in, the, more, exposed, environment, much, like, savanna, baboons, further, among, primates, delayed, maturity, is, also, exhibited, in, the, rhesus, monkey, which, has, a, multi, male, society, and, may, not, be, an, accurate, indicator, of, social, structure, a, 2011, strontium, isotope, study, of, p, robustus, teeth, from, the, dolomite, sterkfontein, valley, found, that, like, other, hominins, but, unlike, other, great, apes, p, robustus, females, were, more, likely, to, leave, their, place, of, birth, patrilocal, this, also, discounts, the, plausibility, of, a, harem, society, which, would, have, resulted, in, a, matrilocal, society, due, to, heightened, male, male, competition, males, did, not, seem, to, have, ventured, very, far, from, the, valley, which, could, either, indicate, small, home, ranges, or, that, they, preferred, dolomitic, landscapes, due, to, perhaps, cave, abundance, or, factors, related, to, vegetation, growth, dental, development, seems, to, have, followed, about, the, same, timeframe, as, it, does, in, modern, humans, and, most, other, hominins, but, since, paranthropus, molars, are, markedly, larger, rate, of, tooth, eruption, would, have, been, accelerated, their, life, history, may, have, mirrored, that, of, gorillas, as, they, have, the, same, brain, volume, which, depending, on, the, subspecies, reach, physical, maturity, from, 12, 18, years, and, have, birthing, intervals, of, 40, 70, months, it, is, generally, thought, that, paranthropus, preferred, to, inhabit, wooded, riverine, landscapes, the, teeth, of, paranthropus, h, habilis, and, h, erectus, are, all, known, from, various, overlapping, beds, in, east, africa, such, as, at, olduvai, gorge, and, the, turkana, basin, p, robustus, and, h, erectus, also, appear, to, have, coexisted, p, boisei, known, from, the, great, rift, valley, may, have, typically, inhabited, wetlands, along, lakes, and, rivers, wooded, or, arid, shrublands, and, semiarid, woodlands, though, their, presence, in, the, savanna, dominated, malawian, chiwondo, beds, implies, they, could, tolerate, a, range, of, habitats, during, the, pleistocene, there, seem, to, have, been, coastal, and, montane, forests, in, eastern, africa, more, expansive, river, valleys, namely, the, omo, river, valley, may, have, served, as, important, refuges, for, forest, dwelling, creatures, being, cut, off, from, the, forests, of, central, africa, by, a, savanna, corridor, these, east, african, forests, would, have, promoted, high, rates, of, endemism, especially, during, times, of, climatic, volatility, the, cradle, of, humankind, the, only, area, p,
