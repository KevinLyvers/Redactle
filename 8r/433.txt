the, subphylum, hexapoda, from, greek, for, six, legs, or, hexapods, comprises, the, largest, clade, of, arthropods, and, includes, most, of, the, extant, arthropod, species, it, includes, the, crown, group, class, insecta, true, insects, as, well, as, the, much, smaller, class, entognatha, which, includes, three, groups, of, wingless, arthropods, that, were, once, considered, insects, collembola, springtails, protura, coneheads, and, diplura, two, pronged, bristletails, the, insects, and, springtails, are, very, abundant, and, are, some, of, the, most, important, pollinators, basal, consumers, scavengers, detritivores, and, micropredators, in, terrestrial, environments, hexapods, are, named, for, their, most, distinctive, feature, a, three, part, body, plan, with, a, consolidated, thorax, and, three, pairs, of, legs, most, other, arthropods, have, more, than, three, pairs, of, legs, most, recent, studies, have, recovered, hexapoda, as, a, subgroup, of, crustacea, hexapods, have, bodies, ranging, in, length, from, 0, 5, mm, to, over, 300, mm, which, are, divided, into, an, anterior, head, thorax, and, posterior, abdomen, the, head, is, composed, of, a, presegmental, acron, that, usually, bears, eyes, absent, in, protura, and, diplura, followed, by, six, segments, all, closely, fused, together, with, the, following, appendages, the, mouth, lies, between, the, fourth, and, fifth, segments, and, is, covered, by, a, projection, from, the, sixth, called, the, labrum, upper, lip, in, true, insects, class, insecta, the, mouthparts, are, exposed, or, ectognathous, while, in, other, groups, they, are, enveloped, or, endognathous, similar, appendages, are, found, on, the, heads, of, myriapoda, and, crustacea, although, the, crustaceans, have, secondary, antennae, collembolans, and, diplurans, have, segmented, antenna, each, segment, has, its, own, set, of, muscles, the, antennea, of, insects, consist, of, just, three, segments, the, scape, the, pedicel, and, the, flagellum, muscles, occur, only, in, the, first, two, segments, the, third, segment, the, flagellum, don, t, have, any, muscles, and, is, composed, of, a, various, number, of, annuli, this, type, of, antenna, is, therefore, called, annulated, antenna, johnston, s, organ, which, is, found, on, the, pedicel, is, absent, in, the, entognatha, the, thorax, is, composed, of, three, segments, each, of, which, bears, a, single, pair, of, legs, as, is, typical, of, arthropods, adapted, to, life, on, land, each, leg, has, only, a, single, walking, branch, composed, of, five, segments, without, the, gill, branches, found, in, some, other, arthropods, and, with, gill, on, the, abdominal, segments, of, some, immature, aquatic, insects, in, most, insects, the, second, and, third, thoracic, segments, also, support, wings, it, has, been, suggested, that, these, may, be, homologous, to, the, gill, branches, of, crustaceans, or, they, may, have, developed, from, extensions, of, the, segments, themselves, the, abdomen, follow, epimorphic, development, where, all, segments, are, already, present, at, the, end, of, embryonic, development, in, all, the, hexapod, groups, except, for, protura, which, has, an, anamorphic, development, where, the, hatched, juveniles, has, an, incomplete, complement, of, segments, and, goes, through, a, post, embryonic, segment, addition, with, each, molting, before, the, final, adult, number, of, segments, is, reached, all, true, insects, have, eleven, segments, often, reduced, in, number, in, many, insect, species, but, in, protura, there, are, twelve, and, in, collembola, only, six, sometimes, reduced, to, only, four, the, appendages, on, the, abdomen, are, extremely, reduced, restricted, to, the, external, genitalia, and, sometimes, a, pair, of, sensory, cerci, on, the, last, segment, the, myriapods, have, traditionally, been, considered, the, closest, relatives, of, the, hexapods, based, on, morphological, similarity, these, were, then, considered, subclasses, of, a, subphylum, called, uniramia, or, atelocerata, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, however, this, was, called, into, question, and, it, appears, the, hexapods, closest, relatives, may, be, the, crustaceans, the, non, insect, hexapods, have, variously, been, considered, a, single, evolutionary, line, typically, treated, as, class, entognatha, or, as, several, lines, with, different, relationships, with, the, class, insecta, in, particular, the, diplura, may, be, more, closely, related, to, the, insecta, than, to, the, collembola, springtails, a, 2002, molecular, analysis, suggests, that, the, hexapods, diverged, from, their, sister, group, the, anostraca, fairy, shrimps, at, around, the, start, of, the, silurian, period, 440, million, years, ago, coinciding, with, the, appearance, of, vascular, plants, on, land, since, then, remipedians, have, been, revealed, as, closest, living, relative, of, hexapods, several, hypotheses, about, their, internal, relationships, have, been, suggested, over, the, years, with, proturans, as, the, sister, group, to, the, other, hexapods, and, collembolans, and, diplurans, belonging, together, in, antennomusculata, as, the, latest, suggestion, the, following, cladogram, is, given, by, kjer, et, al, 2016, collembola, springtails, protura, coneheads, diplura, two, pronged, bristletails, archaeognatha, jumping, bristletails, zygentoma, silverfish, pterygota, winged, insects, an, incomplete, possible, insect, fossil, strudiella, devonica, has, been, recovered, from, the, devonian, period, this, fossil, may, help, to, fill, the, arthropod, gap, from, 385, million, to, 325, million, years, ago, although, some, researchers, oppose, this, view, and, suggest, that, the, fossil, may, instead, represent, a, decomposed, crustacean, or, other, non, insect, in, 2023, a, hexapod, like, arthropod, fossil, from, the, ordovician, marine, fossil, site, castle, bank, was, reported, although, further, study, is, needed
