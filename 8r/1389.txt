mushroom, poisoning, is, poisoning, resulting, from, the, ingestion, of, mushrooms, that, contain, toxic, substances, symptoms, can, vary, from, slight, gastrointestinal, discomfort, to, death, in, about, 10, days, mushroom, toxins, are, secondary, metabolites, produced, by, the, fungus, mushroom, poisoning, is, usually, the, result, of, ingestion, of, wild, mushrooms, after, misidentification, of, a, toxic, mushroom, as, an, edible, species, the, most, common, reason, for, this, misidentification, is, a, close, resemblance, in, terms, of, color, and, general, morphology, of, the, toxic, mushrooms, species, with, edible, species, to, prevent, mushroom, poisoning, mushroom, gatherers, familiarize, themselves, with, the, mushrooms, they, intend, to, collect, as, well, as, with, any, similar, looking, toxic, species, the, safety, of, eating, wild, mushrooms, may, depend, on, methods, of, preparation, for, cooking, some, toxins, such, as, amatoxins, are, thermostable, and, mushrooms, containing, such, toxins, will, not, be, rendered, safe, to, eat, by, cooking, poisonous, mushrooms, contain, a, variety, of, different, toxins, that, can, differ, markedly, in, toxicity, symptoms, of, mushroom, poisoning, may, vary, from, gastric, upset, to, organ, failure, resulting, in, death, serious, symptoms, do, not, always, occur, immediately, after, eating, often, not, until, the, toxin, attacks, the, kidney, or, liver, sometimes, days, or, weeks, later, the, most, common, consequence, of, mushroom, poisoning, is, simply, gastrointestinal, upset, most, poisonous, mushrooms, contain, gastrointestinal, irritants, that, cause, vomiting, and, diarrhea, sometimes, requiring, hospitalization, but, usually, no, long, term, damage, however, there, are, a, number, of, recognized, mushroom, toxins, with, specific, and, sometimes, deadly, effects, the, period, between, ingestion, and, the, onset, of, symptoms, varies, dramatically, between, toxins, some, taking, days, to, show, symptoms, identifiable, as, mushroom, poisoning, new, species, of, fungi, are, continuing, to, be, discovered, with, an, estimated, number, of, 800, new, species, registered, annually, this, added, to, the, fact, that, many, investigations, have, recently, reclassified, some, species, of, mushrooms, from, edible, to, poisonous, has, made, older, classifications, insufficient, at, describing, what, now, is, known, about, the, different, species, of, fungi, that, are, harmful, to, humans, it, is, now, thought, that, of, the, approximately, 100, 000, known, fungi, species, found, worldwide, about, 100, of, them, are, poisonous, to, humans, however, by, far, the, majority, of, mushroom, poisonings, are, not, fatal, and, the, majority, of, fatal, poisonings, are, attributable, to, the, amanita, phalloides, mushroom, a, majority, of, these, cases, are, due, to, mistaken, identity, this, is, a, common, occurrence, with, a, phalloides, in, particular, due, to, its, resemblance, to, the, asian, paddy, straw, mushroom, volvariella, volvacea, both, are, light, colored, and, covered, with, a, universal, veil, when, young, amanitas, can, be, mistaken, for, other, species, as, well, in, particular, when, immature, on, at, least, one, occasion, they, have, been, mistaken, for, coprinus, comatus, in, this, case, the, victim, had, some, limited, experience, in, identifying, mushrooms, but, did, not, take, the, time, to, correctly, identify, these, particular, mushrooms, until, after, he, began, to, experience, symptoms, of, mushroom, poisoning, the, author, of, mushrooms, demystified, david, arora, cautions, puffball, hunters, to, beware, of, amanita, eggs, which, are, amanita, s, still, entirely, encased, in, their, universal, veil, amanita, s, at, this, stage, are, difficult, to, distinguish, from, puffballs, foragers, are, encouraged, to, always, cut, the, fruiting, bodies, of, suspected, puffballs, in, half, as, this, will, reveal, the, outline, of, a, developing, amanita, should, it, be, present, within, the, structure, a, majority, of, mushroom, poisonings, in, general, are, the, result, of, small, children, especially, toddlers, in, the, grazing, stage, ingesting, mushrooms, found, on, the, lawn, while, this, can, happen, with, any, mushroom, chlorophyllum, molybdites, is, often, implicated, due, to, its, preference, for, growing, in, lawns, c, molybdites, causes, severe, gastrointestinal, upset, but, is, not, considered, deadly, poisonous, a, few, poisonings, are, the, result, of, misidentification, while, attempting, to, collect, hallucinogenic, mushrooms, for, recreational, use, in, 1981, one, fatality, and, two, hospitalizations, occurred, following, consumption, of, galerina, marginata, mistaken, for, a, psilocybe, species, galerina, and, psilocybe, species, are, both, small, brown, and, sticky, and, can, be, found, growing, together, however, galerina, contains, amatoxins, the, same, poison, found, in, the, deadly, amanita, species, another, case, reports, kidney, failure, following, ingestion, of, cortinarius, orellanus, a, mushroom, containing, orellanine, it, is, natural, that, accidental, ingestion, of, hallucinogenic, species, also, occurs, but, is, rarely, harmful, when, ingested, in, small, quantities, cases, of, serious, toxicity, have, been, reported, in, small, children, amanita, pantherina, while, containing, the, same, hallucinogens, as, amanita, muscaria, e, g, ibotenic, acid, and, muscimol, has, been, more, commonly, associated, with, severe, gastrointestinal, upset, than, its, better, known, counterpart, although, usually, not, fatal, omphalotus, spp, jack, o, lantern, mushrooms, are, another, cause, of, sometimes, significant, toxicity, they, are, sometimes, mistaken, for, chanterelles, both, are, bright, orange, and, fruit, at, the, same, time, of, year, although, omphalotus, grows, on, wood, and, has, true, gills, rather, than, the, veins, of, a, cantharellus, they, contain, toxins, known, as, illudins, which, causes, gastrointestinal, symptoms, bioluminescent, species, are, generally, inedible, and, often, mildly, toxic, clitocybe, dealbata, which, is, occasionally, mistaken, for, an, oyster, mushroom, or, other, edible, species, contains, muscarine, toxicities, can, also, occur, with, collection, of, morels, even, true, morels, if, eaten, raw, will, cause, gastrointestinal, upset, typically, morels, are, thoroughly, cooked, before, eating, verpa, bohemica, although, referred, to, as, thimble, morels, or, early, morels, by, some, have, caused, toxic, effects, in, some, individuals, gyromitra, spp, false, morels, are, deadly, poisonous, if, eaten, raw, they, contain, a, toxin, called, gyromitrin, which, can, cause, neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal, toxicity, and, destruction, of, the, blood, cells, the, finns, consume, gyromitra, esculenta, after, parboiling, but, this, may, not, render, the, mushroom, entirely, safe, resulting, in, its, being, called, the, fugu, of, the, finnish, cuisine, a, more, unusual, toxin, is, coprine, a, disulfiram, like, compound, that, is, harmless, unless, ingested, within, a, few, days, of, ingesting, alcohol, it, inhibits, aldehyde, dehydrogenase, an, enzyme, required, for, breaking, down, alcohol, thus, the, symptoms, of, toxicity, are, similar, to, being, hung, over, flushing, headache, nausea, palpitations, and, in, severe, cases, trouble, breathing, coprinus, species, including, coprinopsis, atramentaria, contain, coprine, coprinus, comatus, does, not, but, it, is, best, to, avoid, mixing, alcohol, with, other, members, of, this, genus, recently, poisonings, have, also, been, associated, with, amanita, smithiana, these, poisonings, may, be, due, to, orellanine, but, the, onset, of, symptoms, occurs, in, 4, to, 11, hours, which, is, much, quicker, than, the, 3, to, 20, days, normally, associated, with, orellanine, paxillus, involutus, is, also, inedible, when, raw, but, is, eaten, in, europe, after, pickling, or, parboiling, however, after, the, death, of, the, german, mycologist, dr, julius, sch, ffer, it, was, discovered, that, the, mushroom, contains, a, toxin, that, can, stimulate, the, immune, system, to, attack, its, red, blood, cells, this, reaction, is, rare, but, can, occur, even, after, safely, eating, the, mushroom, for, many, years, similarly, tricholoma, equestre, was, widely, considered, edible, and, good, until, it, was, connected, with, rare, cases, of, rhabdomyolysis, in, the, fall, of, 2004, thirteen, deaths, were, associated, with, consumption, of, pleurocybella, porrigens, or, angel, s, wings, in, general, these, mushrooms, are, considered, edible, all, the, victims, died, of, an, acute, brain, disorder, and, all, had, pre, existing, kidney, disease, the, exact, cause, of, the, toxicity, was, not, known, at, this, time, and, the, deaths, cannot, be, definitively, attributed, to, mushroom, consumption, however, mushroom, poisoning, is, not, always, due, to, mistaken, identity, for, example, the, highly, toxic, ergot, claviceps, purpurea, which, grows, on, rye, is, sometimes, ground, up, with, rye, unnoticed, and, later, consumed, this, can, cause, devastating, even, fatal, effects, which, is, called, ergotism, cases, of, idiosyncratic, or, unusual, reactions, to, fungi, can, also, occur, some, are, probably, due, to, allergy, others, to, some, other, kind, of, sensitivity, it, is, not, uncommon, for, a, person, to, experience, gastrointestinal, upset, associated, with, one, particular, mushroom, species, or, genus, some, mushrooms, might, concentrate, toxins, from, their, growth, substrate, such, as, chicken, of, the, woods, growing, on, yew, trees, of, the, most, lethal, mushrooms, five, the, death, cap, a, phalloides, the, three, destroying, angels, a, virosa, a, bisporigera, and, a, ocreata, and, the, fool, s, mushroom, a, verna, belong, to, the, genus, amanita, and, two, more, the, deadly, webcap, c, rubellus, and, the, fool, s, webcap, c, orellanus, are, from, the, genus, cortinarius, several, species, of, galerina, lepiota, and, conocybe, also, contain, lethal, amounts, of, amatoxins, deadly, species, are, listed, in, the, list, of, deadly, fungi, the, following, species, may, cause, great, discomfort, sometimes, requiring, hospitalization, but, are, not, considered, deadly, many, different, species, of, mushrooms, are, poisonous, and, contain, differing, toxins, that, cause, different, types, of, harm, the, most, common, toxin, that, causes, severe, poisoning, is, amatoxin, found, in, various, mushroom, species, that, cause, the, most, fatalities, every, year, amanita, or, the, death, cap, is, a, type, of, mushroom, named, for, its, substantial, amount, of, amatoxin, which, has, about, 10, mg, per, mushroom, which, is, the, lethal, dose, amatoxin, blocks, the, replication, of, dna, which, leads, to, cell, death, this, can, affect, cells, that, replicate, frequently, such, as, kidneys, livers, and, eventually, the, central, nervous, system, it, can, also, cause, the, loss, of, muscle, contraction, and, liver, failure, despite, the, severe, and, dangerous, symptoms, amatoxin, poisoning, is, treatable, given, quick, professional, care, mushrooms, have, also, been, found, to, have, evolved, toxicity, independently, from, each, other, researchers, have, found, that, different, mushroom, species, share, the, same, type, of, amatoxin, called, amanitin, they, specifically, looked, at, three, of, the, deadliest, species, amanita, galerina, and, lepiota, through, genome, sequencing, a, scientific, process, that, determines, the, dna, sequence, of, an, organism, s, genome, closely, related, mushrooms, obtained, genetic, information, via, horizontal, gene, transfer, once, assimilated, it, can, then, be, passed, down, to, an, offspring, the, researchers, also, concluded, that, there, is, an, unknown, ancestral, fungal, donor, that, allowed, for, horizontal, gene, transfer, mushroom, toxins, have, appeared, and, disappeared, many, times, throughout, their, evolutionary, history, many, scientists, believe, that, the, toxins, evolved, in, mushrooms, are, used, to, deter, predation, either, from, fungivores, or, mammals, if, mushrooms, are, consumed, it, can, negatively, affect, their, ability, to, disperse, spores, survive, and, reproduce, snails, and, insects, are, fungivores, and, many, have, learned, or, evolved, to, avoid, eating, poisonous, mushrooms, however, it, is, believed, that, mammals, pose, a, higher, threat, to, mushrooms, than, fungivores, as, larger, body, sizes, mean, they, are, more, capable, of, eating, an, entire, fungus, in, one, sitting, some, phenotypes, or, observable, characteristics, may, co, occur, with, toxicity, and, therefore, act, as, a, warning, signal, the, first, potential, warning, sign, is, aposematism, which, is, an, adaptation, that, warns, off, predators, based, on, a, physical, trait, of, an, organism, in, this, case, the, researchers, were, interested, in, observing, whether, the, color, of, a, mushroom, deters, predators, this, would, suggest, that, toxic, mushrooms, are, of, different, colors, than, non, poisonous, ones, the, visual, cue, of, some, colors, should, be, enough, for, predators, to, know, not, to, consume, the, mushroom, the, second, possible, warning, sign, is, olfactory, aposematism, a, similar, concept, but, instead, of, focusing, on, color, the, odor, of, the, mushroom, would, be, what, deters, predation, this, would, again, indicate, that, poisonous, mushrooms, would, emit, a, different, odor, than, non, poisonous, ones, alternatively, is, the, ability, of, organisms, to, learn, from, other, organisms, this, would, suggest, that, avoidance, of, toxic, mushrooms, is, a, learned, behavior, organisms, may, avoid, toxic, mushrooms, if, they, observed, other, organisms, of, the, same, species, consume, the, fungus, learned, behavior, is, when, an, organism, learns, how, to, behave, based, on, previous, experiences, some, researchers, believe, that, if, an, organism, got, sick, or, observed, another, organism, get, sick, from, consuming, a, poisonous, mushroom, then, they, would, know, not, to, continue, consuming, it, for, fear, of, getting, sick, again, an, analysis, of, 245, north, american, mushroom, species, and, 265, from, europe, revealed, 21, 2, of, the, north, american, species, and, 12, 1, of, the, european, ones, as, poisonous, after, collecting, this, information, and, using, a, neural, network, to, classify, all, of, the, mushrooms, based, on, color, and, odor, the, researchers, concluded, that, there, was, no, correlation, between, cap, color, and, mushrooms, containing, toxins, the, cap, is, the, top, rounded, part, of, a, mushroom, and, comes, in, different, colors, this, proposes, that, the, cap, color, does, not, act, as, a, warning, sign, to, deter, predators, providing, no, evidence, that, poisonous, mushrooms, may, not, signal, their, toxicity, through, visual, or, chemical, traits, the, three, deadly, mushrooms, listed, above, amanita, galerina, and, lepiota, are, all, of, different, colors, consisting, of, reds, yellows, browns, and, whites, a, possible, theory, as, to, why, color, is, not, a, factor, in, determining, whether, a, mushroom, is, poisonous, is, the, fact, that, many, of, its, predators, are, nocturnal, and, have, poor, vision, therefore, viewing, the, different, colors, is, difficult, and, could, result, in, inaccurate, consumption, the, study, however, did, suggest, that, poisonous, mushrooms, do, emit, a, smell, that, is, unpleasant, and, therefore, discourages, consumption, despite, this, result, there, is, no, definitive, evidence, to, suggest, if, the, odor, is, a, result, of, the, production, of, the, toxin, or, if, it, is, intended, as, a, warning, signal, additionally, many, of, the, odors, are, not, picked, up, by, humans, this, could, suggest, that, there, is, another, characteristic, difference, between, poisonous, and, non, poisonous, mushrooms, to, avoid, predation, from, larger, mammals, or, that, there, is, another, purpose, for, some, mushrooms, being, poisonous, that, is, not, dependent, on, predators, some, mushrooms, contain, less, toxic, compounds, and, therefore, are, not, severely, poisonous, poisonings, by, these, mushrooms, may, respond, well, to, treatment, however, certain, types, of, mushrooms, contain, very, potent, toxins, and, are, very, poisonous, so, even, if, symptoms, are, treated, promptly, mortality, is, high, with, some, toxins, death, can, occur, in, a, week, or, a, few, days, although, a, liver, or, kidney, transplant, may, save, some, patients, with, complete, organ, failure, in, many, cases, there, are, no, organs, available, patients, hospitalized, and, given, aggressive, support, therapy, almost, immediately, after, ingestion, of, amanitin, containing, mushrooms, have, a, mortality, rate, of, only, 10, whereas, those, admitted, 60, or, more, hours, after, ingestion, have, a, 50, 90, mortality, rate, in, the, united, states, mushroom, poisoning, kills, an, average, of, about, 3, people, a, year, according, to, national, poison, data, system, npds, annual, reports, published, by, america, s, poison, centers, the, average, number, of, deaths, occurring, over, a, ten, year, period, 2012, 2020, sits, right, at, 3, a, year, in, 2012, 4, out, of, the, 7, total, deaths, that, occurred, that, year, were, attributed, to, a, single, event, where, a, housekeeper, at, a, board, and, care, home, for, elderly, dementia, patients, collected, and, cooked, wild, amanita, mushrooms, into, a, sauce, that, she, consumed, with, six, residents, of, the, home, over, 1, 300, emergency, room, visits, in, the, united, states, were, attributed, to, poisonous, mushroom, ingestion, in, 2016, with, about, 9, of, patients, experiencing, a, serious, adverse, outcome, many, folk, traditions, concern, the, defining, features, of, poisonous, mushrooms, however, there, are, no, general, identifiers, for, poisonous, mushrooms, so, such, traditions, are, unreliable, guidelines, to, identify, particular, mushrooms, exist, and, will, serve, only, if, one, knows, which, mushrooms, are, toxic, examples, of, erroneous, folklore, rules, include
