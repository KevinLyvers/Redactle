the, thyroid, or, thyroid, gland, is, an, endocrine, gland, in, vertebrates, in, humans, it, is, in, the, neck, and, consists, of, two, connected, lobes, the, lower, two, thirds, of, the, lobes, are, connected, by, a, thin, band, of, tissue, called, the, isthmus, pl, isthmi, the, thyroid, gland, is, a, butterfly, shaped, gland, located, in, the, neck, below, the, adam, s, apple, microscopically, the, functional, unit, of, the, thyroid, gland, is, the, spherical, thyroid, follicle, lined, with, follicular, cells, thyrocytes, and, occasional, parafollicular, cells, that, surround, a, lumen, containing, colloid, the, thyroid, gland, secretes, three, hormones, the, two, thyroid, hormones, triiodothyronine, t, 3, and, thyroxine, t, 4, and, a, peptide, hormone, calcitonin, the, thyroid, hormones, influence, the, metabolic, rate, and, protein, synthesis, and, growth, and, development, in, children, calcitonin, plays, a, role, in, calcium, homeostasis, secretion, of, the, two, thyroid, hormones, is, regulated, by, thyroid, stimulating, hormone, tsh, which, is, secreted, from, the, anterior, pituitary, gland, tsh, is, regulated, by, thyrotropin, releasing, hormone, trh, which, is, produced, by, the, hypothalamus, thyroid, disorders, include, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroid, inflammation, thyroiditis, thyroid, enlargement, goitre, thyroid, nodules, and, thyroid, cancer, hyperthyroidism, is, characterized, by, excessive, secretion, of, thyroid, hormones, the, most, common, cause, is, the, autoimmune, disorder, graves, disease, hypothyroidism, is, characterized, by, a, deficient, secretion, of, thyroid, hormones, the, most, common, cause, is, iodine, deficiency, in, iodine, deficient, regions, hypothyroidism, due, to, iodine, deficiency, is, the, leading, cause, of, preventable, intellectual, disability, in, children, in, iodine, sufficient, regions, the, most, common, cause, of, hypothyroidism, is, the, autoimmune, disorder, hashimoto, s, thyroiditis, the, thyroid, gland, is, a, butterfly, shaped, organ, composed, of, two, lobes, left, and, right, connected, by, a, narrow, tissue, band, called, an, isthmus, it, weighs, 25, grams, in, adults, with, each, lobe, being, about, 5, cm, long, 3, cm, wide, and, 2, cm, thick, and, the, isthmus, about, 1, 25, cm, in, height, and, width, the, gland, is, usually, larger, in, women, than, in, men, and, increases, in, size, during, pregnancy, the, thyroid, is, near, the, front, of, the, neck, lying, against, and, around, the, front, of, the, larynx, and, trachea, the, thyroid, cartilage, and, cricoid, cartilage, lie, just, above, the, gland, below, the, adam, s, apple, the, isthmus, extends, from, the, second, to, third, rings, of, the, trachea, with, the, uppermost, part, of, the, lobes, extending, to, the, thyroid, cartilage, and, the, lowermost, around, the, fourth, to, sixth, tracheal, rings, the, infrahyoid, muscles, lie, in, front, of, the, gland, and, the, sternocleidomastoid, muscle, to, the, side, behind, the, outer, wings, of, the, thyroid, lie, the, two, carotid, arteries, the, trachea, larynx, lower, pharynx, and, esophagus, all, lie, behind, the, thyroid, in, this, region, the, recurrent, laryngeal, nerve, and, the, inferior, thyroid, artery, pass, next, to, or, in, the, ligament, typically, four, parathyroid, glands, two, on, each, side, lie, on, each, side, between, the, two, layers, of, the, thyroid, capsule, at, the, back, of, the, thyroid, lobes, the, thyroid, gland, is, covered, by, a, thin, fibrous, capsule, which, has, an, inner, and, an, outer, layer, the, inner, layer, extrudes, into, the, gland, and, forms, the, septa, that, divide, the, thyroid, tissue, into, microscopic, lobules, the, outer, layer, is, continuous, with, the, pretracheal, fascia, attaching, the, gland, to, the, cricoid, and, thyroid, cartilages, via, a, thickening, of, the, fascia, to, form, the, posterior, suspensory, ligament, of, thyroid, gland, also, known, as, berry, s, ligament, this, causes, the, thyroid, to, move, up, and, down, with, the, movement, of, these, cartilages, when, swallowing, occurs, the, thyroid, is, supplied, with, arterial, blood, from, the, superior, thyroid, artery, a, branch, of, the, external, carotid, artery, and, the, inferior, thyroid, artery, a, branch, of, the, thyrocervical, trunk, and, sometimes, by, an, anatomical, variant, the, thyroid, ima, artery, which, has, a, variable, origin, the, superior, thyroid, artery, splits, into, anterior, and, posterior, branches, supplying, the, thyroid, and, the, inferior, thyroid, artery, splits, into, superior, and, inferior, branches, the, superior, and, inferior, thyroid, arteries, join, behind, the, outer, part, of, the, thyroid, lobes, the, venous, blood, is, drained, via, superior, and, middle, thyroid, veins, which, drain, to, the, internal, jugular, vein, and, via, the, inferior, thyroid, veins, the, inferior, thyroid, veins, originate, in, a, network, of, veins, and, drain, into, the, left, and, right, brachiocephalic, veins, both, arteries, and, veins, form, a, plexus, between, the, two, layers, of, the, capsule, of, the, thyroid, gland, lymphatic, drainage, frequently, passes, the, prelaryngeal, lymph, nodes, located, just, above, the, isthmus, and, the, pretracheal, and, paratracheal, lymph, nodes, the, gland, receives, sympathetic, nerve, supply, from, the, superior, middle, and, inferior, cervical, ganglion, of, the, sympathetic, trunk, the, gland, receives, parasympathetic, nerve, supply, from, the, superior, laryngeal, nerve, and, the, recurrent, laryngeal, nerve, there, are, many, variants, in, the, size, and, shape, of, the, thyroid, gland, and, in, the, position, of, the, embedded, parathyroid, glands, sometimes, there, is, a, third, lobe, present, called, the, pyramidal, lobe, when, present, this, lobe, often, stretches, up, to, the, hyoid, bone, from, the, thyroid, isthmus, and, may, be, one, to, several, divided, lobes, the, presence, of, this, lobe, ranges, in, reported, studies, from, 18, 3, to, 44, 6, it, was, shown, to, more, often, arise, from, the, left, side, and, occasionally, separated, the, pyramidal, lobe, is, also, known, as, lalouette, s, pyramid, the, pyramidal, lobe, is, a, remnant, of, the, thyroglossal, duct, which, usually, wastes, away, during, the, thyroid, gland, s, descent, small, accessory, thyroid, glands, may, in, fact, occur, anywhere, along, the, thyroglossal, duct, from, the, foramen, cecum, of, the, tongue, to, the, position, of, the, thyroid, in, the, adult, a, small, horn, at, the, back, of, the, thyroid, lobes, usually, close, to, the, recurrent, laryngeal, nerve, and, the, inferior, thyroid, artery, is, called, zuckerkandl, s, tubercle, other, variants, include, a, levator, muscle, of, thyroid, gland, connecting, the, isthmus, to, the, body, of, the, hyoid, bone, and, the, presence, of, the, small, thyroid, ima, artery, at, the, microscopic, level, there, are, three, primary, features, of, the, thyroid, thyroid, follicles, thyroid, follicular, cells, and, parafollicular, cells, first, discovered, by, geoffery, websterson, in, 1664, thyroid, follicles, are, small, spherical, groupings, of, cells, 0, 02, 0, 9mm, in, diameter, that, play, the, main, role, in, thyroid, function, they, consist, of, a, rim, that, has, a, rich, blood, supply, nerve, and, lymphatic, presence, that, surrounds, a, core, of, colloid, that, consists, mostly, of, thyroid, hormone, precursor, proteins, called, thyroglobulin, an, iodinated, glycoprotein, the, core, of, a, follicle, is, surrounded, by, a, single, layer, of, follicular, cells, when, stimulated, by, thyroid, stimulating, hormone, tsh, these, secrete, the, thyroid, hormones, t, 3, and, t, 4, they, do, this, by, transporting, and, metabolising, the, thyroglobulin, contained, in, the, colloid, follicular, cells, vary, in, shape, from, flat, to, cuboid, to, columnar, depending, on, how, active, they, are, the, follicular, lumen, is, the, fluid, filled, space, within, a, follicle, of, the, thyroid, gland, there, are, hundreds, of, follicles, within, the, thyroid, gland, a, follicle, is, formed, by, a, spherical, arrangement, of, follicular, cells, the, follicular, lumen, is, filled, with, colloid, a, concentrated, solution, of, thyroglobulin, and, is, the, site, of, synthesis, of, the, thyroid, hormones, thyroxine, t4, and, triiodothyronine, t3, scattered, among, follicular, cells, and, in, spaces, between, the, spherical, follicles, are, another, type, of, thyroid, cell, parafollicular, cells, these, cells, secrete, calcitonin, and, so, are, also, called, c, cells, in, the, development, of, the, embryo, at, 3, 4, weeks, gestational, age, the, thyroid, gland, appears, as, an, epithelial, proliferation, in, the, floor, of, the, pharynx, at, the, base, of, the, tongue, between, the, tuberculum, impar, and, the, copula, linguae, the, copula, soon, becomes, covered, over, by, the, hypopharyngeal, eminence, at, a, point, later, indicated, by, the, foramen, cecum, the, thyroid, then, descends, in, front, of, the, pharyngeal, gut, as, a, bilobed, diverticulum, through, the, thyroglossal, duct, over, the, next, few, weeks, it, migrates, to, the, base, of, the, neck, passing, in, front, of, the, hyoid, bone, during, migration, the, thyroid, remains, connected, to, the, tongue, by, a, narrow, canal, the, thyroglossal, duct, at, the, end, of, the, fifth, week, the, thyroglossal, duct, degenerates, and, over, the, following, two, weeks, the, detached, thyroid, migrates, to, its, final, position, the, fetal, hypothalamus, and, pituitary, start, to, secrete, thyrotropin, releasing, hormone, trh, and, thyroid, stimulating, hormone, tsh, tsh, is, first, measurable, at, 11, weeks, by, 18, 20, weeks, the, production, of, thyroxine, t, 4, reaches, a, clinically, significant, and, self, sufficient, level, fetal, triiodothyronine, t, 3, remains, low, less, than, 15, ng, dl, until, 30, weeks, and, increases, to, 50, ng, dl, at, full, term, the, fetus, needs, to, be, self, sufficient, in, thyroid, hormones, in, order, to, guard, against, neurodevelopmental, disorders, that, would, arise, from, maternal, hypothyroidism, the, presence, of, sufficient, iodine, is, essential, for, healthy, neurodevelopment, the, neuroendocrine, parafollicular, cells, also, known, as, c, cells, responsible, for, the, production, of, calcitonin, are, derived, from, foregut, endoderm, this, part, of, the, thyroid, then, first, forms, as, the, ultimopharyngeal, body, which, begins, in, the, ventral, fourth, pharyngeal, pouch, and, joins, the, primordial, thyroid, gland, during, its, descent, to, its, final, location, aberrations, in, prenatal, development, can, result, in, various, forms, of, thyroid, dysgenesis, which, can, cause, congenital, hypothyroidism, and, if, untreated, this, can, lead, to, cretinism, the, primary, function, of, the, thyroid, is, the, production, of, the, iodine, containing, thyroid, hormones, triiodothyronine, t, 3, and, thyroxine, or, tetraiodothyronine, t, 4, and, the, peptide, hormone, calcitonin, the, thyroid, hormones, are, created, from, iodine, and, tyrosine, t, 3, is, so, named, because, it, contains, three, atoms, of, iodine, per, molecule, and, t, 4, contains, four, atoms, of, iodine, per, molecule, the, thyroid, hormones, have, a, wide, range, of, effects, on, the, human, body, these, include, after, secretion, only, a, very, small, proportion, of, the, thyroid, hormones, travel, freely, in, the, blood, most, are, bound, to, thyroxine, binding, globulin, about, 70, transthyretin, 10, and, albumin, 15, only, the, 0, 03, of, t, 4, and, 0, 3, of, t, 3, traveling, freely, have, hormonal, activity, in, addition, up, to, 85, of, the, t, 3, in, blood, is, produced, following, conversion, from, t, 4, by, iodothyronine, deiodinases, in, organs, around, the, body, thyroid, hormones, act, by, crossing, the, cell, membrane, and, binding, to, intracellular, nuclear, thyroid, hormone, receptors, tr, 1, tr, 2, tr, 1, and, tr, 2, which, bind, with, hormone, response, elements, and, transcription, factors, to, modulate, dna, transcription, in, addition, to, these, actions, on, dna, the, thyroid, hormones, also, act, within, the, cell, membrane, or, within, cytoplasm, via, reactions, with, enzymes, including, calcium, atpase, adenylyl, cyclase, and, glucose, transporters, the, thyroid, hormones, are, created, from, thyroglobulin, this, is, a, protein, within, the, colloid, in, the, follicular, lumen, that, is, originally, created, within, the, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, of, follicular, cells, and, then, transported, into, the, follicular, lumen, thyroglobulin, contains, 123, units, of, tyrosine, which, reacts, with, iodine, within, the, follicular, lumen, iodine, is, essential, for, the, production, of, the, thyroid, hormones, iodine, i, 0, travels, in, the, blood, as, iodide, i, which, is, taken, up, into, the, follicular, cells, by, a, sodium, iodide, symporter, this, is, an, ion, channel, on, the, cell, membrane, which, in, the, same, action, transports, two, sodium, ions, and, an, iodide, ion, into, the, cell, iodide, then, travels, from, within, the, cell, into, the, lumen, through, the, action, of, pendrin, an, iodide, chloride, antiporter, in, the, follicular, lumen, the, iodide, is, then, oxidized, to, iodine, this, makes, it, more, reactive, and, the, iodine, is, attached, to, the, active, tyrosine, units, in, thyroglobulin, by, the, enzyme, thyroid, peroxidase, this, forms, the, precursors, of, thyroid, hormones, monoiodotyrosine, mit, and, diiodotyrosine, dit, when, the, follicular, cells, are, stimulated, by, thyroid, stimulating, hormone, the, follicular, cells, reabsorb, thyroglobulin, from, the, follicular, lumen, the, iodinated, tyrosines, are, cleaved, forming, the, thyroid, hormones, t, 4, t, 3, dit, mit, and, traces, of, reverse, triiodothyronine, t, 3, and, t, 4, are, released, into, the, blood, the, hormones, secreted, from, the, gland, are, about, 80, 90, t, 4, and, about, 10, 20, t, 3, deiodinase, enzymes, in, peripheral, tissues, remove, the, iodine, from, mit, and, dit, and, convert, t, 4, to, t, 3, and, rt, 3, this, is, a, major, source, of, both, rt, 3, 95, and, t, 3, 87, in, peripheral, tissues, the, production, of, thyroxine, and, triiodothyronine, is, primarily, regulated, by, thyroid, stimulating, hormone, tsh, released, by, the, anterior, pituitary, gland, tsh, release, in, turn, is, stimulated, by, thyrotropin, releasing, hormone, trh, released, in, a, pulsatile, manner, from, the, hypothalamus, the, thyroid, hormones, provide, negative, feedback, to, the, thyrotropes, tsh, and, trh, when, the, thyroid, hormones, are, high, tsh, production, is, suppressed, this, negative, feedback, also, occurs, when, levels, of, tsh, are, high, causing, trh, production, to, be, suppressed, trh, is, secreted, at, an, increased, rate, in, situations, such, as, cold, exposure, in, order, to, stimulate, thermogenesis, in, addition, to, being, suppressed, by, the, presence, of, thyroid, hormones, tsh, production, is, blunted, by, dopamine, somatostatin, and, glucocorticoids, the, thyroid, gland, also, produces, the, hormone, calcitonin, which, helps, regulate, blood, calcium, levels, parafollicular, cells, produce, calcitonin, in, response, to, high, blood, calcium, calcitonin, decreases, the, release, of, calcium, from, bone, by, decreasing, the, activity, of, osteoclasts, cells, which, break, down, bone, bone, is, constantly, reabsorbed, by, osteoclasts, and, created, by, osteoblasts, so, calcitonin, effectively, stimulates, movement, of, calcium, into, bone, the, effects, of, calcitonin, are, opposite, those, of, the, parathyroid, hormone, pth, produced, in, the, parathyroid, glands, however, calcitonin, seems, far, less, essential, than, pth, since, calcium, metabolism, remains, clinically, normal, after, removal, of, the, thyroid, thyroidectomy, but, not, the, parathyroid, glands, about, 20, 000, protein, coding, genes, are, expressed, in, human, cells, 70, of, these, genes, are, expressed, in, thyroid, cells, two, hundred, and, fifty, of, these, genes, are, more, specifically, expressed, in, the, thyroid, and, about, 20, genes, are, highly, thyroid, specific, in, the, follicular, cells, the, proteins, synthesized, by, these, genes, direct, thyroid, hormone, synthesis, thyroglobulin, tpo, and, iyd, while, in, the, parafollicular, c, cells, they, direct, calcitonin, synthesis, calca, and, calcb, general, practitioners, and, internal, medicine, specialists, play, a, role, in, identifying, and, monitoring, the, treatment, of, thyroid, disease, endocrinologists, and, thyroidologists, are, thyroid, specialists, thyroid, surgeons, or, otolaryngologists, are, responsible, for, the, surgical, management, of, thyroid, disease, excessive, production, of, the, thyroid, hormones, is, called, hyperthyroidism, causes, include, graves, disease, toxic, multinodular, goitre, solitary, thyroid, adenoma, inflammation, and, a, pituitary, adenoma, which, secretes, excess, tsh, another, cause, is, excess, iodine, availability, either, from, excess, ingestion, induced, by, the, drug, amiodarone, or, following, iodinated, contrast, imaging, hyperthyroidism, often, causes, a, variety, of, non, specific, symptoms, including, weight, loss, increased, appetite, insomnia, decreased, tolerance, of, heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety, and, nervousness, in, some, cases, it, can, cause, chest, pain, diarrhoea, hair, loss, and, muscle, weakness, such, symptoms, may, be, managed, temporarily, with, drugs, such, as, beta, blockers, long, term, management, of, hyperthyroidism, may, include, drugs, that, suppress, thyroid, function, such, as, propylthiouracil, carbimazole, and, methimazole, alternatively, radioactive, iodine, 131, can, be, used, to, destroy, thyroid, tissue, radioactive, iodine, is, selectively, taken, up, by, thyroid, cells, which, over, time, destroys, them, the, chosen, first, line, treatment, will, depend, on, the, individual, and, on, the, country, where, being, treated, surgery, to, remove, the, thyroid, can, sometimes, be, performed, as, a, transoral, thyroidectomy, a, minimally, invasive, procedure, surgery, does, however, carry, a, risk, of, damage, to, the, parathyroid, glands, and, the, recurrent, laryngeal, nerve, which, innervates, the, vocal, cords, if, the, entire, thyroid, gland, is, removed, hypothyroidism, will, inevitably, result, and, thyroid, hormone, substitutes, will, be, needed, an, underactive, thyroid, gland, results, in, hypothyroidism, typical, symptoms, are, abnormal, weight, gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy, menstrual, bleeding, hair, loss, cold, intolerance, and, a, slow, heart, rate, iodine, deficiency, is, the, most, common, cause, of, hypothyroidism, worldwide, and, the, autoimmune, disease, hashimoto, s, thyroiditis, is, the, most, common, cause, in, the, developed, world, other, causes, include, congenital, abnormalities, diseases, causing, transient, inflammation, surgical, removal, or, radioablation, of, the, thyroid, the, drugs, amiodarone, and, lithium, amyloidosis, and, sarcoidosis, some, forms, of, hypothyroidism, can, result, in, myxedema, and, severe, cases, can, result, in, myxedema, coma, hypothyroidism, is, managed, with, replacement, of, the, thyroid, hormones, this, is, usually, given, daily, as, an, oral, supplement, and, may, take, a, few, weeks, to, become, effective, some, causes, of, hypothyroidism, such, as, postpartum, thyroiditis, and, subacute, thyroiditis, may, be, transient, and, pass, over, time, and, other, causes, such, as, iodine, deficiency, may, be, able, to, be, rectified, with, dietary, supplementation, graves, disease, is, an, autoimmune, disorder, that, is, the, most, common, cause, of, hyperthyroidism, in, graves, disease, for, an, unknown, reason, autoantibodies, develop, against, the, thyroid, stimulating, hormone, receptor, these, antibodies, activate, the, receptor, leading, to, development, of, a, goitre, and, symptoms, of, hyperthyroidism, such, as, heat, intolerance, weight, loss, diarrhoea, and, palpitations, occasionally, such, antibodies, block, but, do, not, activate, the, receptor, leading, to, symptoms, associated, with, hypothyroidism, in, addition, gradual, protrusion, of, the, eyes, may, occur, called, graves, ophthalmopathy, as, may, swelling, of, the, front, of, the, shins, graves, disease, can, be, diagnosed, by, the, presence, of, pathomnomonic, features, such, as, involvement, of, the, eyes, and, shins, or, isolation, of, autoantibodies, or, by, results, of, a, radiolabelled, uptake, scan, graves, disease, is, treated, with, anti, thyroid, drugs, such, as, propylthiouracil, which, decrease, the, production, of, thyroid, hormones, but, hold, a, high, rate, of, relapse, if, there, is, no, involvement, of, the, eyes, then, use, of, radioactive, isotopes, to, ablate, the, gland, may, be, considered, surgical, removal, of, the, gland, with, subsequent, thyroid, hormone, replacement, may, be, considered, however, this, will, not, control, symptoms, associated, with, the, eye, or, skin, thyroid, nodules, are, often, found, on, the, gland, with, a, prevalence, of, 4, 7, the, majority, of, nodules, do, not, cause, any, symptoms, thyroid, hormone, secretion, is, normal, and, they, are, non, cancerous, non, cancerous, cases, include, simple, cysts, colloid, nodules, and, thyroid, adenomas, malignant, nodules, which, only, occur, in, about, 5, of, nodules, include, follicular, papillary, medullary, carcinomas, and, metastasis, from, other, sites, nodules, are, more, likely, in, females, those, who, are, exposed, to, radiation, and, in, those, who, are, iodine, deficient, when, a, nodule, is, present, thyroid, function, tests, determine, whether, the, nodule, is, secreting, excess, thyroid, hormones, causing, hyperthyroidism, when, the, thyroid, function, tests, are, normal, an, ultrasound, is, often, used, to, investigate, the, nodule, and, provide, information, such, as, whether, the, nodule, is, fluid, filled, or, a, solid, mass, and, whether, the, appearance, is, suggestive, of, a, benign, or, malignant, cancer, a, needle, aspiration, biopsy, may, then, be, performed, and, the, sample, undergoes, cytology, in, which, the, appearance, of, cells, is, viewed, to, determine, whether, they, resemble, normal, or, cancerous, cells, the, presence, of, multiple, nodules, is, called, a, multinodular, goitre, and, if, it, is, associated, with, hyperthyroidism, it, is, called, a, toxic, multinodular, goitre, an, enlarged, thyroid, gland, is, called, a, goitre, goitres, are, present, in, some, form, in, about, 5, of, people, and, are, the, result, of, a, large, number, of, causes, including, iodine, deficiency, autoimmune, disease, both, graves, disease, and, hashimoto, s, thyroiditis, infection, inflammation, and, infiltrative, disease, such, as, sarcoidosis, and, amyloidosis, sometimes, no, cause, can, be, found, a, state, called, simple, goitre, some, forms, of, goitre, are, associated, with, pain, whereas, many, do, not, cause, any, symptoms, enlarged, goitres, may, extend, beyond, the, normal, position, of, the, thyroid, gland, to, below, the, sternum, around, the, airway, or, esophagus, goitres, may, be, associated, with, hyperthyroidism, or, hypothyroidism, relating, to, the, underlying, cause, of, the, goitre, thyroid, function, tests, may, be, done, to, investigate, the, cause, and, effects, of, the, goitre, the, underlying, cause, of, the, goitre, may, be, treated, however, many, goitres, with, no, associated, symptoms, are, simply, monitored, inflammation, of, the, thyroid, is, called, thyroiditis, and, may, cause, symptoms, of, hyperthyroidism, or, hypothyroidism, two, types, of, thyroiditis, initially, present, with, hyperthyroidism, and, are, sometimes, followed, by, a, period, of, hypothyroidism, hashimoto, s, thyroiditis, and, postpartum, thyroiditis, there, are, other, disorders, that, cause, inflammation, of, the, thyroid, and, these, include, subacute, thyroiditis, acute, thyroiditis, silent, thyroiditis, riedel, s, thyroiditis, and, traumatic, injury, including, palpation, thyroiditis, hashimoto, s, thyroiditis, is, an, autoimmune, disorder, in, which, the, thyroid, gland, is, infiltrated, by, the, lymphocytes, b, cell, and, t, cells, these, progressively, destroy, the, thyroid, gland, in, this, way, hasimoto, s, thyroiditis, may, have, occurred, insidiously, and, only, be, noticed, when, thyroid, hormone, production, decreases, causing, symptoms, of, hypothyroidism, hashimoto, s, is, more, common, in, females, than, males, much, more, common, after, the, age, of, 60, and, has, known, genetic, risk, factors, also, more, common, in, individuals, with, hashimoto, s, thyroiditis, are, type, 1, diabetes, pernicious, anaemia, addison, s, disease, vitiligo, postpartum, thyroiditis, occurs, sometimes, following, childbirth, after, delivery, the, thyroid, becomes, inflamed, and, the, condition, initially, presents, with, a, period, of, hyperthyroidism, followed, by, hypothyroidism, and, usually, a, return, to, normal, function, the, course, of, the, illness, takes, place, over, several, months, and, is, characterised, by, a, painless, goitre, antibodies, against, thyroid, peroxidase, can, be, found, on, testing, the, inflammation, usually, resolves, without, treatment, although, thyroid, hormone, replacement, may, be, needed, during, the, period, of, hypothyroidism, the, most, common, tumor, affecting, the, thyroid, is, a, benign, adenoma, usually, presenting, as, a, painless, mass, in, the, neck, thyroid, cancers, are, most, often, carcinomas, although, cancer, can, occur, in, any, tissue, that, the, thyroid, consists, of, including, cancer, of, c, cells, and, lymphomas, cancers, from, other, sites, also, rarely, lodge, in, the, thyroid, radiation, of, the, head, and, neck, presents, a, risk, factor, for, thyroid, cancer, and, cancer, is, more, common, in, women, than, men, occurring, at, a, rate, of, about, 2, 1, in, most, cases, thyroid, cancer, presents, as, a, painless, mass, in, the, neck, it, is, very, unusual, for, thyroid, cancers, to, present, with, other, symptoms, although, in, some, cases, cancer, may, cause, hyperthyroidism, most, thyroid, cancers, are, papillary, followed, by, follicular, medullary, and, thyroid, lymphoma, because, of, the, prominence, of, the, thyroid, gland, cancer, is, often, detected, earlier, in, the, course, of, disease, as, the, cause, of, a, nodule, which, may, undergo, fine, needle, aspiration, thyroid, function, tests, will, help, reveal, whether, the, nodule, produces, excess, thyroid, hormones, a, radioactive, iodine, uptake, test, can, help, reveal, the, activity, and, location, of, the, cancer, and, metastases, thyroid, cancers, are, treated, by, removing, the, whole, or, part, of, thyroid, gland, radioactive, iodine, 131, may, be, given, to, radioablate, the, thyroid, thyroxine, is, given, to, replace, the, hormones, lost, and, to, suppress, tsh, production, as, tsh, may, stimulate, recurrence, with, the, exception, of, the, rare, anaplastic, thyroid, cancer, which, carries, a, very, poor, prognosis, most, thyroid, cancers, carry, an, excellent, prognosis, and, can, even, be, considered, curable, a, persistent, thyroglossal, duct, is, the, most, common, clinically, significant, birth, defect, of, the, thyroid, gland, a, persistent, sinus, tract, may, remain, as, a, vestigial, remnant, of, the, tubular, development, of, the, thyroid, gland, parts, of, this, tube, may, be, obliterated, leaving, small, segments, to, form, thyroglossal, cysts, preterm, neonates, are, at, risk, of, hypothyroidism, as, their, thyroid, glands, are, insufficiently, developed, to, meet, their, postnatal, needs, in, order, to, detect, hypothyroidism, in, newborn, babies, to, prevent, growth, and, development, abnormalities, in, later, life, many, countries, have, newborn, screening, programs, at, birth, infants, with, thyroid, hormone, deficiency, congenital, hypothyroidism, can, manifest, problems, of, physical, growth, and, development, as, well, as, brain, development, termed, cretinism, children, with, congenital, hypothyroidism, are, treated, supplementally, with, levothyroxine, which, facilitates, normal, growth, and, development, mucinous, clear, secretions, may, collect, within, these, cysts, to, form, either, spherical, masses, or, fusiform, swellings, rarely, larger, than, 2, to, 3, cm, in, diameter, these, are, present, in, the, midline, of, the, neck, anterior, to, the, trachea, segments, of, the, duct, and, cysts, that, occur, high, in, the, neck, are, lined, by, stratified, squamous, epithelium, which, is, essentially, identical, to, that, covering, the, posterior, portion, of, the, tongue, in, the, region, of, the, foramen, cecum, the, disorders, that, occur, in, the, lower, neck, more, proximal, to, the, thyroid, gland, are, lined, by, epithelium, resembling, the, thyroidal, acinar, epithelium, characteristically, next, to, the, lining, epithelium, there, is, an, intense, lymphocytic, infiltrate, superimposed, infection, may, convert, these, lesions, into, abscess, cavities, and, rarely, give, rise, to, cancers, another, disorder, is, that, of, thyroid, dysgenesis, which, can, result, in, various, presentations, of, one, or, more, misplaced, accessory, thyroid, glands, these, can, be, asymptomatic, iodine, deficiency, most, common, in, inland, and, mountainous, areas, can, predispose, to, goitre, if, widespread, known, as, endemic, goitre, pregnant, women, deficient, of, iodine, can, give, birth, to, infants, with, thyroid, hormone, deficiency, the, use, of, iodised, salt, to, add, iodine, to, the, diet, has, eliminated, endemic, cretinism, in, most, developed, countries, and, over, 120, countries, have, made, the, iodination, of, salt, mandatory, because, the, thyroid, concentrates, iodine, it, also, concentrates, the, various, radioactive, isotopes, of, iodine, produced, by, nuclear, fission, in, the, event, of, large, accidental, releases, of, such, material, into, the, environment, the, uptake, of, radioactive, iodine, isotopes, by, the, thyroid, can, in, theory, be, blocked, by, saturating, the, uptake, mechanism, with, a, large, surplus, of, non, radioactive, iodine, taken, in, the, form, of, potassium, iodide, tablets, one, consequence, of, the, chernobyl, disaster, was, an, increase, in, thyroid, cancers, in, children, in, the, years, following, the, accident, excessive, iodine, intake, is, uncommon, and, usually, has, no, effect, on, the, thyroid, function, sometimes, though, it, may, cause, hyperthyroidism, and, sometimes, hypothyroidism, with, a, resulting, goitre, the, thyroid, is, examined, by, observation, of, the, gland, and, surrounding, neck, for, swelling, or, enlargement, it, is, then, felt, usually, from, behind, and, a, person, is, often, asked, to, swallow, to, better, feel, the, gland, against, the, fingers, of, the, examiner, the, gland, moves, up, and, down, with, swallowing, because, of, its, attachments, to, the, thyroid, and, cricoid, cartilages, in, a, healthy, person, the, gland, is, not, visible, yet, is, palpable, as, a, soft, mass, examination, of, the, thyroid, gland, includes, the, search, for, abnormal, masses, and, the, assessment, of, overall, thyroid, size, the, character, of, the, thyroid, swellings, nodules, and, their, consistency, may, all, be, able, to, be, felt, if, a, goitre, is, present, an, examiner, may, also, feel, down, the, neck, consider, tapping, the, upper, part, of, the, chest, to, check, for, extension, further, tests, may, include, raising, the, arms, pemberton, s, sign, listening, to, the, gland, with, a, stethoscope, for, bruits, testing, of, reflexes, and, palpation, of, the, lymph, nodes, in, the, head, and, neck, an, examination, of, the, thyroid, will, also, include, observation, of, the, person, as, a, whole, to, look, for, systemic, signs, such, as, weight, gain, or, loss, hair, loss, and, signs, in, other, locations, such, as, protrusion, of, the, eyes, or, swelling, of, the, calves, in, graves, disease, thyroid, function, tests, include, a, battery, of, blood, tests, including, the, measurement, of, the, thyroid, hormones, as, well, as, the, measurement, of, thyroid, stimulating, hormone, tsh, they, may, reveal, hyperthyroidism, high, t, 3, and, t, 4, hypothyroidism, low, t, 3, t, 4, or, subclinical, hyperthyroidism, normal, t, 3, and, t, 4, with, a, low, tsh, tsh, levels, are, considered, the, most, sensitive, marker, of, thyroid, dysfunction, they, are, however, not, always, accurate, particularly, if, the, cause, of, hypothyroidism, is, thought, to, be, related, to, insufficient, thyrotropin, releasing, hormone, trh, secretion, in, which, case, it, may, be, low, or, falsely, normal, in, such, a, case, a, trh, stimulation, test, in, which, trh, is, given, and, tsh, levels, are, measured, at, 30, and, 60, minutes, after, may, be, conducted, t, 3, and, t, 4, can, be, measured, directly, however, as, the, two, thyroid, hormones, travel, bound, to, other, molecules, and, it, is, the, free, component, that, is, biologically, active, free, t, 3, and, free, t, 4, levels, can, be, measured, t, 3, is, preferred, because, in, hypothyroidism, t, 3, levels, may, be, normal, the, ratio, of, bound, to, unbound, thyroid, hormones, is, known, as, the, thyroid, hormone, binding, ratio, thbr, it, is, also, possible, to, measure, directly, the, main, carriers, of, the, thyroid, hormones, thyroglobulin, and, throxine, binding, globulin, thyroglobulin, will, also, be, measurable, in, a, healthy, thyroid, and, will, increase, with, inflammation, and, may, also, be, used, to, measure, the, success, of, thyroid, removal, or, ablation, if, successful, thyroglobulin, should, be, undetectable, lastly, antibodies, against, components, of, the, thyroid, particularly, anti, tpo, and, anti, thyroglobulin, can, be, measured, these, may, be, present, in, normal, individuals, but, are, highly, sensitive, for, autoimmune, related, disease, ultrasound, of, the, thyroid, may, be, used, to, reveal, whether, structures, are, solid, or, filled, with, fluid, helping, to, differentiate, between, nodules, and, goitres, and, cysts, it, may, also, help, differentiate, between, malignant, and, benign, lesions, when, further, imaging, is, required, a, radiolabelled, iodine, 123, or, technetium, 99, uptake, scan, may, take, place, this, can, determine, the, size, and, shape, of, lesions, reveal, whether, nodules, or, goitres, are, metabolically, active, and, reveal, and, monitor, sites, of, thyroid, disease, or, cancer, deposits, outside, the, thyroid, a, fine, needle, aspiration, of, a, sample, of, thyroid, tissue, may, be, taken, in, order, to, evaluate, a, lesion, seen, on, ultrasound, which, is, then, sent, for, histopathology, and, cytology, computed, tomography, of, the, thyroid, plays, an, important, role, in, the, evaluation, of, thyroid, cancer, ct, scans, often, incidentally, find, thyroid, abnormalities, and, thereby, practically, becomes, the, first, investigation, modality, the, thyroid, gland, received, its, modern, name, in, the, 1600s, when, the, anatomist, thomas, wharton, likened, its, shape, to, that, of, an, ancient, greek, shield, or, thyos, however, the, existence, of, the, gland, and, of, the, diseases, associated, with, it, was, known, long, before, then, the, presence, and, diseases, of, the, thyroid, have, been, noted, and, treated, for, thousands, of, years, in, 1600, bce, burnt, sponge, and, seaweed, which, contain, iodine, were, used, within, china, for, the, treatment, of, goitres, a, practice, which, has, developed, in, many, parts, of, the, world, in, ayurvedic, medicine, the, book, sushruta, samhita, written, about, 1400, bce, described, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and, goitre, aristotle, and, xenophon, in, the, fifth, century, bce, describe, cases, of, diffuse, toxic, goitre, hippocrates, and, plato, in, the, fourth, century, bce, provided, some, of, the, first, descriptions, of, the, gland, itself, proposing, its, function, as, a, salivary, gland, pliny, the, elder, in, the, first, century, bce, referred, to, epidemics, of, goitre, in, the, alps, and, proposed, treatment, with, burnt, seaweed, a, practice, also, referred, to, by, galen, in, the, second, century, referred, to, burnt, sponge, for, the, treatment, of, goitre, the, chinese, pharmacology, text, shennong, ben, cao, jing, written, ca, 200, 250, also, refers, to, goitre, in, 1500, polymath, leonardo, da, vinci, provided, the, first, illustration, of, the, thyroid, in, 1543, anatomist, andreas, vesalius, gave, the, first, anatomic, description, and, illustration, of, the, gland, in, 1656, the, thyroid, received, its, modern, name, by, the, anatomist, thomas, wharton, the, gland, was, named, thyroid, meaning, shield, as, its, shape, resembled, the, shields, commonly, used, in, ancient, greece, the, english, name, thyroid, gland, is, derived, from, the, medical, latin, used, by, wharton, glandula, thyreoidea, glandula, means, gland, in, latin, and, thyreoidea, can, be, traced, back, to, the, ancient, greek, word, meaning, shield, like, shield, shaped, french, chemist, bernard, courtois, discovered, iodine, in, 1811, and, in, 1896, eugen, baumann, documented, it, as, the, central, ingredient, in, the, thyroid, gland, he, did, this, by, boiling, the, thyroid, glands, of, a, thousand, sheep, and, named, the, precipitate, a, combination, of, the, thyroid, hormones, iodothyrin, david, marine, in, 1907, proved, that, iodine, is, necessary, for, thyroid, function, graves, disease, was, described, by, robert, james, graves, in, 1834, the, role, of, the, thyroid, gland, in, metabolism, was, demonstrated, in, 1895, by, adolf, magnus, levy, thyroxine, was, first, isolated, in, 1914, and, synthesized, in, 1927, and, triiodothyroxine, in, 1952, the, conversion, of, t, 4, to, t, 3, was, discovered, in, 1970, the, process, of, discovering, tsh, took, place, over, the, early, to, mid, twentieth, century, trh, was, discovered, by, polish, endocrinologist, andrew, schally, in, 1970, contributing, in, part, to, his, nobel, prize, in, medicine, in, 1977, in, the, nineteenth, century, numerous, authors, described, both, cretinism, and, myxedema, and, their, relationship, to, the, thyroid, charles, mayo, coined, the, term, hyperthyroidism, in, 1910, hakaru, hashimoto, documented, a, case, of, hashimoto, s, thyroiditis, in, 1912, antibodies, in, this, disease, were, demonstrated, in, 1956, knowledge, of, the, thyroid, and, its, conditions, developed, throughout, the, late, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, with, many, modern, treatments, and, investigative, modalities, evolving, throughout, the, mid, twentieth, century, including, the, use, of, radioactive, iodine, thiouracil, and, fine, needle, aspiration, either, aetius, in, the, sixth, century, ce, or, persian, ali, ibn, abbas, al, magusi, in, 990, ce, conducted, the, first, recorded, thyroidectomy, as, a, treatment, for, goitre, operations, remained, risky, and, generally, were, not, successful, until, the, 19th, century, when, descriptions, emerged, from, a, number, of, authors, including, prussian, surgeon, theodor, billroth, swiss, surgeon, and, physiologist, theodor, kocher, american, physician, charles, mayo, american, surgeons, william, halsted, and, george, crile, these, descriptions, provided, the, basis, for, modern, thyroid, surgery, theodor, kocher, went, on, to, win, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1909, for, his, work, on, the, physiology, pathology, and, surgery, of, the, thyroid, gland, the, thyroid, gland, is, found, in, all, vertebrates, in, fish, it, is, usually, located, below, the, gills, and, is, not, always, divided, into, distinct, lobes, however, in, some, teleosts, patches, of, thyroid, tissue, are, found, elsewhere, in, the, body, associated, with, the, kidneys, spleen, heart, or, eyes, in, tetrapods, the, thyroid, is, always, found, somewhere, in, the, neck, region, in, most, tetrapod, species, there, are, two, paired, thyroid, glands, that, is, the, right, and, left, lobes, are, not, joined, however, there, is, only, ever, a, single, thyroid, gland, in, most, mammals, and, the, shape, found, in, humans, is, common, to, many, other, species, in, larval, lampreys, the, thyroid, originates, as, an, exocrine, gland, secreting, its, hormones, into, the, gut, and, associated, with, the, larva, s, filter, feeding, apparatus, in, the, adult, lamprey, the, gland, separates, from, the, gut, and, becomes, endocrine, but, this, path, of, development, may, reflect, the, evolutionary, origin, of, the, thyroid, for, instance, the, closest, living, relatives, of, vertebrates, the, tunicates, and, amphioxi, lancelets, have, a, structure, very, similar, to, that, of, larval, lampreys, the, endostyle, and, this, also, secretes, iodine, containing, compounds, though, not, thyroxine, thyroxine, is, critical, to, metabolic, regulation, and, growth, throughout, the, vertebrate, clade, iodine, and, t, 4, trigger, the, change, from, a, plant, eating, water, dwelling, tadpole, into, a, meat, eating, land, dwelling, frog, with, better, neurological, visuospatial, smell, and, cognitive, abilities, for, hunting, as, seen, in, other, predatory, animals, a, similar, phenomenon, happens, in, the, neotenic, amphibian, salamanders, which, without, introducing, iodine, do, not, transform, into, land, dwelling, adults, and, live, and, reproduce, in, the, larval, form, of, aquatic, axolotl, among, amphibians, administering, a, thyroid, blocking, agent, such, as, propylthiouracil, ptu, can, prevent, tadpoles, from, metamorphosing, into, frogs, in, contrast, administering, thyroxine, will, trigger, metamorphosis, in, amphibian, metamorphosis, thyroxine, and, iodine, also, exert, a, well, studied, experimental, model, of, apoptosis, on, the, cells, of, gills, tail, and, fins, of, tadpoles, iodine, via, iodolipids, has, favored, the, evolution, of, terrestrial, animal, species, and, has, likely, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, evolution, of, the, human, brain
