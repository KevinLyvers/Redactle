whooping, cough, h, u, p, also, known, as, pertussis, or, the, 100, day, cough, is, a, highly, contagious, vaccine, preventable, bacterial, disease, initial, symptoms, are, usually, similar, to, those, of, the, common, cold, with, a, runny, nose, fever, and, mild, cough, but, these, are, followed, by, two, or, three, months, of, severe, coughing, fits, following, a, fit, of, coughing, a, high, pitched, whoop, sound, or, gasp, may, occur, as, the, person, breathes, in, the, violent, coughing, may, last, for, 10, or, more, weeks, hence, the, phrase, 100, day, cough, the, cough, may, be, so, hard, that, it, causes, vomiting, rib, fractures, and, fatigue, children, less, than, one, year, old, may, have, little, or, no, cough, and, instead, have, periods, when, they, cannot, breathe, the, incubation, period, is, usually, seven, to, ten, days, disease, may, occur, in, those, who, have, been, vaccinated, but, symptoms, are, typically, milder, pertussis, is, caused, by, the, bacterium, bordetella, pertussis, which, is, spread, easily, through, the, coughs, and, sneezes, of, an, infected, person, people, are, infectious, from, the, start, of, symptoms, until, about, three, weeks, into, the, coughing, fits, diagnosis, is, by, collecting, a, sample, from, the, back, of, the, nose, and, throat, this, sample, can, then, be, tested, either, by, culture, or, by, polymerase, chain, reaction, prevention, is, mainly, by, vaccination, with, the, pertussis, vaccine, initial, immunization, is, recommended, between, six, and, eight, weeks, of, age, with, four, doses, to, be, given, in, the, first, two, years, of, life, protection, from, pertussis, decreases, over, time, so, additional, doses, of, vaccine, are, often, recommended, for, older, children, and, adults, vaccination, during, pregnancy, is, highly, effective, at, protecting, the, infant, from, pertussis, during, their, vulnerable, early, months, of, life, and, is, recommended, in, many, countries, antibiotics, may, be, used, to, prevent, the, disease, in, those, who, have, been, exposed, and, are, at, risk, of, severe, disease, in, those, with, the, disease, antibiotics, are, useful, if, started, within, three, weeks, of, the, initial, symptoms, but, otherwise, have, little, effect, in, most, people, in, pregnant, women, and, children, less, than, one, year, old, antibiotics, are, recommended, within, six, weeks, of, symptom, onset, antibiotics, used, include, erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, or, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, evidence, to, support, interventions, for, the, cough, other, than, antibiotics, is, poor, about, 50, of, infected, children, less, than, a, year, old, require, hospitalization, and, nearly, 0, 5, 1, in, 200, die, an, estimated, 16, 3, million, people, worldwide, were, infected, in, 2015, most, cases, occur, in, the, developing, world, and, people, of, all, ages, may, be, affected, in, 2015, pertussis, resulted, in, 58, 700, deaths, down, from, 138, 000, deaths, in, 1990, outbreaks, of, the, disease, were, first, described, in, the, 16th, century, the, bacterium, that, causes, the, infection, was, discovered, in, 1906, the, pertussis, vaccine, became, available, in, the, 1940s, the, classic, symptoms, of, pertussis, are, a, paroxysmal, cough, inspiratory, whoop, and, fainting, or, vomiting, after, coughing, the, cough, from, pertussis, has, been, documented, to, cause, subconjunctival, hemorrhages, rib, fractures, urinary, incontinence, hernias, and, vertebral, artery, dissection, violent, coughing, can, cause, the, pleura, to, rupture, leading, to, a, pneumothorax, vomiting, after, a, coughing, spell, or, an, inspiratory, whooping, sound, on, coughing, almost, doubles, the, likelihood, that, the, illness, is, pertussis, the, absence, of, a, paroxysmal, cough, or, posttussive, emesis, though, makes, it, almost, half, as, likely, the, illness, usually, starts, with, mild, respiratory, symptoms, including, mild, coughing, sneezing, or, a, runny, nose, known, as, the, catarrhal, stage, after, one, or, two, weeks, the, coughing, classically, develops, into, uncontrollable, fits, sometimes, followed, by, a, high, pitched, whoop, sound, as, the, person, tries, to, inhale, about, 50, of, children, and, adults, whoop, at, some, point, in, diagnosed, pertussis, cases, during, the, paroxysmal, stage, this, stage, usually, lasts, up, to, 3, months, or, sometimes, longer, a, gradual, transition, then, occurs, to, the, convalescent, stage, which, usually, lasts, one, to, four, weeks, this, stage, is, marked, by, a, decrease, in, paroxysms, of, coughing, although, paroxysms, may, occur, with, subsequent, respiratory, infection, for, many, months, after, the, onset, of, pertussis, symptoms, of, pertussis, can, be, variable, especially, between, immunized, and, non, immunized, people, those, that, are, immunized, can, present, with, a, more, mild, infection, they, may, only, have, the, paroxysmal, cough, for, a, couple, of, weeks, and, it, may, lack, the, whooping, characteristic, although, immunized, people, have, a, milder, form, of, the, infection, they, can, spread, the, disease, to, others, who, are, not, immune, the, time, between, exposure, and, the, development, of, symptoms, is, on, average, 7, 14, days, range, 6, 20, days, rarely, as, long, as, 42, days, pertussis, is, caused, by, the, bacterium, bordetella, pertussis, it, is, an, airborne, disease, through, droplets, that, spreads, easily, through, the, coughs, and, sneezes, of, an, infected, person, humans, are, the, only, host, species, of, b, pertussis, outbreaks, of, whooping, cough, have, been, observed, among, chimpanzees, in, a, zoo, and, among, wild, gorillas, in, both, cases, it, is, considered, likely, that, the, infection, was, acquired, as, a, result, of, close, contact, with, humans, several, zoos, have, a, long, standing, custom, of, vaccinating, their, primates, against, whooping, cough, after, the, bacteria, are, inhaled, they, initially, adhere, to, the, ciliated, epithelium, in, the, nasopharynx, surface, proteins, of, b, pertussis, including, filamentous, hemaglutinin, and, pertactin, mediate, attachment, to, the, epithelium, the, bacteria, then, multiply, in, infants, who, experience, more, severe, disease, the, bacteria, spread, down, to, the, lungs, the, bacteria, secretes, a, number, of, toxins, tracheal, cytotoxin, tct, a, fragment, of, peptidoglycan, kills, ciliated, epithelial, cells, in, the, airway, and, thereby, inhibits, the, mechanism, which, clears, the, airways, of, mucus, and, debris, tct, may, contribute, to, the, cough, characteristic, of, pertussis, pertussis, toxin, causes, lymphocytosis, by, an, unknown, mechanism, the, elevated, number, of, white, blood, cells, leads, to, pulmonary, hypertension, a, major, cause, of, death, by, pertussis, in, infants, who, develop, encephalopathy, cerebral, hemorrhage, and, cortical, atrophy, occur, likely, due, to, hypoxia, a, physician, s, overall, impression, is, most, effective, in, initially, making, the, diagnosis, single, factors, are, much, less, useful, in, adults, with, a, cough, of, less, than, 8, weeks, vomiting, after, coughing, or, a, whoop, is, supportive, if, there, are, no, bouts, of, coughing, or, there, is, a, fever, the, diagnosis, is, unlikely, in, children, who, have, a, cough, of, less, than, 4, weeks, vomiting, after, coughing, is, somewhat, supportive, but, not, definitive, methods, used, in, laboratory, diagnosis, include, culturing, of, nasopharyngeal, swabs, on, a, nutrient, medium, bordet, gengou, medium, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, direct, fluorescent, antibody, dfa, and, serological, methods, e, g, complement, fixation, test, the, bacteria, can, be, recovered, from, the, person, only, during, the, first, three, weeks, of, illness, rendering, culturing, and, dfa, useless, after, this, period, although, pcr, may, have, some, limited, usefulness, for, an, additional, three, weeks, serology, may, be, used, for, adults, and, adolescents, who, have, already, been, infected, for, several, weeks, to, determine, whether, antibody, against, pertussis, toxin, or, another, virulence, factor, of, b, pertussis, is, present, at, high, levels, in, the, blood, of, the, person, a, similar, milder, disease, is, caused, by, b, parapertussis, the, primary, method, of, prevention, for, pertussis, is, vaccination, evidence, is, insufficient, to, determine, the, effectiveness, of, antibiotics, in, those, who, have, been, exposed, but, are, without, symptoms, preventive, antibiotics, however, are, still, frequently, used, in, those, who, have, been, exposed, and, are, at, high, risk, of, severe, disease, such, as, infants, pertussis, vaccines, are, effective, at, preventing, illness, and, are, recommended, for, routine, use, by, the, world, health, organization, and, the, united, states, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, the, vaccine, saved, an, estimated, half, a, million, lives, in, 2002, the, multicomponent, acellular, pertussis, vaccine, is, 71, 85, effective, with, greater, effectiveness, against, more, severe, strains, however, despite, widespread, vaccination, pertussis, has, persisted, in, vaccinated, populations, and, is, today, one, of, the, most, common, vaccine, preventable, diseases, in, western, countries, the, 21st, century, resurgences, in, pertussis, infections, is, attributed, to, a, combination, of, waning, immunity, and, bacterial, mutations, that, elude, vaccines, immunization, does, not, confer, lifelong, immunity, a, 2011, cdc, study, indicated, that, protection, may, only, last, three, to, six, years, this, covers, childhood, which, is, the, time, of, greatest, exposure, and, greatest, risk, of, death, from, pertussis, an, effect, of, widespread, immunization, on, society, has, been, the, shift, of, reported, infections, from, children, aged, 1, 9, years, to, infants, adolescents, and, adults, with, adolescents, and, adults, acting, as, reservoirs, for, b, pertussis, and, infecting, infants, who, have, had, fewer, than, three, doses, of, vaccine, infection, induces, incomplete, natural, immunity, that, wanes, over, time, a, 2005, study, said, estimates, of, the, duration, of, infection, acquired, immunity, range, from, 7, to, 20, years, and, the, different, results, could, be, the, result, of, differences, in, levels, of, circulating, b, pertussis, surveillance, systems, and, case, definitions, used, the, study, said, protective, immunity, after, vaccination, wanes, after, 4, 12, years, one, study, suggested, that, the, availability, of, vaccine, exemptions, increases, the, number, of, pertussis, cases, some, studies, have, suggested, that, while, acellular, pertussis, vaccines, are, effective, at, preventing, the, disease, they, have, a, limited, impact, on, infection, and, transmission, meaning, that, vaccinated, people, could, spread, pertussis, even, though, they, may, have, only, mild, symptoms, or, none, at, all, pertussis, infection, in, these, persons, may, be, asymptomatic, or, present, as, illness, ranging, from, a, mild, cough, to, classic, pertussis, with, persistent, cough, i, e, lasting, more, than, 7, days, even, though, the, disease, may, be, milder, in, older, persons, those, who, are, infected, may, transmit, the, disease, to, other, susceptible, persons, including, unimmunized, or, incompletely, immunized, infants, older, persons, are, often, found, to, have, the, first, case, in, a, household, with, multiple, pertussis, cases, and, are, often, the, source, of, infection, for, children, the, antibiotics, erythromycin, clarithromycin, or, azithromycin, are, typically, the, recommended, treatment, newer, macrolides, are, frequently, recommended, due, to, lower, rates, of, side, effects, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, tmp, smx, may, be, used, in, those, with, allergies, to, first, line, agents, or, in, infants, who, have, a, risk, of, pyloric, stenosis, from, macrolides, a, reasonable, guideline, is, to, treat, people, age, 1, year, within, 3, weeks, of, cough, onset, and, infants, age, 1, year, and, pregnant, women, within, 6, weeks, of, cough, onset, if, the, person, is, diagnosed, late, antibiotics, will, not, alter, the, course, of, the, illness, and, even, without, antibiotics, they, should, no, longer, be, spreading, pertussis, when, used, early, antibiotics, decrease, the, duration, of, infectiousness, and, thus, prevent, spread, short, term, antibiotics, azithromycin, for, 3, 5, days, are, as, effective, as, long, term, treatment, erythromycin, 10, 14, days, in, eliminating, b, pertussis, with, fewer, and, less, severe, side, effects, people, with, pertussis, are, most, infectious, during, the, first, two, weeks, following, the, onset, of, symptoms, effective, treatments, of, the, cough, associated, with, this, condition, have, not, been, developed, the, use, of, over, the, counter, cough, medications, is, discouraged, and, has, not, been, found, helpful, while, most, healthy, older, children, and, adults, fully, recover, infection, in, newborns, is, particularly, severe, pertussis, is, fatal, in, an, estimated, 0, 5, of, us, infants, under, one, year, of, age, first, year, infants, are, also, more, likely, to, develop, complications, such, as, apneas, 31, pneumonia, 12, seizures, 0, 6, and, encephalopathy, 0, 15, this, may, be, due, to, the, ability, of, the, bacterium, to, suppress, the, immune, system, pertussis, is, endemic, worldwide, more, than, 151, 000, cases, were, reported, globally, during, 2018, however, not, all, cases, are, reported, or, correctly, diagnosed, especially, in, developing, countries, pertussis, is, one, of, the, leading, causes, of, vaccine, preventable, deaths, worldwide, a, study, in, 2017, estimated, the, global, burden, of, the, disease, to, be, 24, million, cases, per, year, with, 160, 000, deaths, among, young, children, with, about, 90, of, all, cases, occurring, in, developing, countries, before, vaccines, an, average, of, 178, 171, cases, was, reported, in, the, u, s, with, peaks, reported, every, two, to, five, years, more, than, 93, of, reported, cases, occurred, in, children, under, 10, years, of, age, the, actual, incidence, was, likely, much, higher, after, vaccinations, were, introduced, in, the, 1940s, pertussis, incidence, fell, dramatically, to, approximately, 1, 000, by, 1976, incidence, rates, have, increased, since, 1980, in, 2015, 20, 762, people, were, reported, to, have, been, infected, in, the, united, states, pertussis, is, the, only, vaccine, preventable, disease, that, is, associated, with, increasing, deaths, in, the, u, s, the, number, of, deaths, increased, from, four, in, 1996, to, 17, in, 2001, almost, all, of, which, were, infants, under, one, year, in, the, u, s, pertussis, in, adults, has, increased, significantly, since, about, 2004, epidemics, of, the, disease, occur, cyclically, every, three, to, 5, years, both, in, areas, with, vaccination, programs, and, those, without, over, time, immunity, declines, in, those, who, have, either, been, vaccinated, or, have, recovered, from, infection, in, addition, infants, are, born, who, are, susceptible, to, infection, an, epidemic, can, occur, once, herd, immunity, reduces, below, decreases, below, a, certain, level, it, is, also, possible, that, the, bacterium, is, evolving, to, evade, vaccine, induced, immunity, b, pertussis, was, discovered, in, 1906, by, jules, bordet, and, octave, gengou, who, also, developed, the, first, serology, and, vaccine, efforts, to, develop, an, inactivated, whole, cell, vaccine, began, soon, after, b, pertussis, was, cultured, that, year, in, the, 1920s, louis, w, sauer, developed, a, weak, vaccine, for, whooping, cough, at, evanston, hospital, evanston, il, in, 1925, danish, physician, thorvald, madsen, was, the, first, to, test, a, whole, cell, vaccine, on, a, wide, scale, madsen, used, the, vaccine, to, control, outbreaks, in, the, faroe, islands, in, the, north, sea, in, 1932, an, outbreak, of, whooping, cough, hit, atlanta, georgia, prompting, pediatrician, leila, denmark, to, begin, her, study, of, the, disease, over, the, next, six, years, her, work, was, published, in, the, journal, of, the, american, medical, association, and, in, partnership, with, emory, university, and, eli, lilly, company, she, developed, the, first, pertussis, vaccine, in, 1942, american, scientists, grace, eldering, loney, gordon, and, pearl, kendrick, combined, the, whole, cell, pertussis, vaccine, with, diphtheria, and, tetanus, toxoids, to, generate, the, first, dtp, combination, vaccine, to, minimize, the, frequent, side, effects, caused, by, the, pertussis, component, japanese, scientist, yuji, sato, developed, an, acellular, vaccine, consisting, of, purified, haemagglutinins, has, filamentous, strep, throat, and, leukocytosis, promoting, factor, ha, which, are, secreted, by, b, pertussis, sato, s, acellular, pertussis, vaccine, was, used, in, japan, starting, in, 1981, later, versions, of, the, acellular, vaccine, in, other, countries, consisted, of, additional, defined, components, of, b, pertussis, and, were, often, part, of, the, dtap, combination, vaccine
