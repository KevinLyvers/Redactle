gallus, domesticus, l, the, chicken, gallus, domesticus, is, a, large, and, round, short, winged, bird, domesticated, from, the, red, junglefowl, of, southeast, asia, around, 8, 000, years, ago, most, chickens, are, raised, for, food, providing, meat, and, eggs, others, are, kept, as, pets, or, for, cockfighting, chickens, are, common, and, widespread, domestic, animals, with, a, total, population, of, 26, 5, billion, as, of, 2023, and, an, annual, production, of, more, than, 50, billion, birds, a, hen, bred, for, laying, can, produce, over, 300, eggs, per, year, there, are, numerous, cultural, references, to, chickens, in, folklore, religion, and, literature, terms, for, chickens, include, chicken, can, mean, a, chick, as, in, william, shakespeare, s, play, macbeth, where, macduff, laments, the, death, of, all, my, pretty, chickens, and, their, dam, the, usage, is, preserved, in, placenames, such, as, the, hen, and, chicken, islands, in, older, sources, and, still, often, in, trade, and, scientific, contexts, chickens, as, a, species, are, described, as, common, fowl, or, domestic, fowl, chickens, are, relatively, large, birds, active, by, day, the, body, is, round, the, legs, are, unfeathered, in, most, breeds, and, the, wings, are, short, wild, junglefowl, can, fly, chickens, and, their, flight, muscles, are, too, heavy, to, allow, them, to, fly, more, than, a, short, distance, size, and, coloration, vary, widely, between, breeds, adult, chickens, of, both, sexes, have, a, fleshy, crest, on, their, heads, called, a, comb, or, cockscomb, and, hanging, flaps, of, skin, on, either, side, under, their, beaks, called, wattles, combs, and, wattles, are, more, prominent, in, males, some, breeds, have, a, mutation, that, causes, extra, feathering, under, the, face, giving, the, appearance, of, a, beard, chickens, are, omnivores, in, the, wild, they, scratch, at, the, soil, to, search, for, seeds, insects, and, animals, as, large, as, lizards, small, snakes, and, young, mice, a, chicken, may, live, for, 5, 10, years, depending, on, the, breed, the, world, s, oldest, known, chicken, lived, for, 16, years, chickens, are, gregarious, living, in, flocks, and, incubate, eggs, and, raise, young, communally, individual, chickens, dominate, others, establishing, a, pecking, order, dominant, individuals, take, priority, for, access, to, food, and, nest, sites, the, concept, of, dominance, involving, pecking, was, described, in, female, chickens, by, thorleif, schjelderup, ebbe, in, 1921, as, the, pecking, order, male, chickens, tend, to, leap, and, use, their, claws, in, conflicts, chickens, are, capable, of, mobbing, and, killing, a, weak, or, inexperienced, predator, such, as, a, young, fox, a, male, s, crowing, is, a, loud, and, sometimes, shrill, call, serving, as, a, territorial, signal, to, other, males, and, in, response, to, sudden, disturbances, within, their, surroundings, hens, cluck, loudly, after, laying, an, egg, and, to, call, their, chicks, chickens, give, different, warning, calls, to, indicate, that, a, predator, is, approaching, from, the, air, or, on, the, ground, to, initiate, courting, some, roosters, may, dance, in, a, circle, around, or, near, a, hen, a, circle, dance, often, lowering, the, wing, which, is, closest, to, the, hen, the, dance, triggers, a, response, in, the, hen, and, when, she, responds, to, his, call, the, rooster, may, mount, the, hen, and, proceed, with, the, mating, mating, typically, involves, a, sequence, in, which, the, male, approaches, the, female, and, performs, a, waltzing, display, if, the, female, is, unreceptive, she, runs, off, otherwise, she, crouches, and, the, male, mounts, treading, with, both, feet, on, her, back, after, copulation, the, male, does, a, tail, bending, display, sperm, transfer, occurs, by, cloacal, contact, between, the, male, and, female, in, an, action, called, the, cloacal, kiss, as, with, all, birds, reproduction, is, controlled, by, a, neuroendocrine, system, the, gonadotropin, releasing, hormone, i, neurons, in, the, hypothalamus, reproductive, hormones, including, estrogen, progesterone, and, gonadotropins, luteinizing, hormone, and, follicle, stimulating, hormone, initiate, and, maintain, sexual, maturation, changes, reproduction, declines, with, age, thought, to, be, due, to, a, decline, in, gnrh, i, n, hens, often, try, to, lay, in, nests, that, already, contain, eggs, and, sometimes, move, eggs, from, neighbouring, nests, into, their, own, a, flock, thus, uses, only, a, few, preferred, locations, rather, than, having, a, different, nest, for, every, bird, under, natural, conditions, most, birds, lay, only, until, a, clutch, is, complete, they, then, incubate, all, the, eggs, this, is, called, going, broody, the, hen, sits, on, the, nest, fluffing, up, or, pecking, defensively, if, disturbed, she, rarely, leaves, the, nest, until, the, eggs, have, hatched, eggs, of, chickens, from, the, high, altitude, region, of, tibet, have, special, physiological, adaptations, that, result, in, a, higher, hatching, rate, in, low, oxygen, environments, when, eggs, are, placed, in, a, hypoxic, environment, chicken, embryos, from, these, populations, express, much, more, hemoglobin, than, embryos, from, other, chicken, populations, this, hemoglobin, has, a, greater, affinity, for, oxygen, binding, oxygen, more, readily, fertile, chicken, eggs, hatch, at, the, end, of, the, incubation, period, about, 21, days, the, chick, uses, its, egg, tooth, to, break, out, of, the, shell, hens, remain, on, the, nest, for, about, two, days, after, the, first, chick, hatches, during, this, time, the, newly, hatched, chicks, feed, by, absorbing, the, internal, yolk, sac, the, hen, guards, her, chicks, and, broods, them, to, keep, them, warm, she, leads, them, to, food, and, water, and, calls, them, towards, food, the, chicks, imprint, on, the, hen, and, subsequently, follow, her, continually, she, continues, to, care, for, them, until, they, are, several, weeks, old, inbreeding, of, white, leghorn, chickens, tends, to, cause, inbreeding, depression, expressed, as, reduced, egg, number, and, delayed, sexual, maturity, strongly, inbred, langshan, chickens, display, obvious, inbreeding, depression, in, reproduction, particularly, for, traits, such, as, age, when, the, first, egg, is, laid, and, egg, number, water, or, ground, dwelling, fowl, similar, to, modern, partridges, in, the, galliformes, the, order, of, bird, that, chickens, belong, to, survived, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, that, killed, all, tree, dwelling, birds, and, their, dinosaur, relatives, chickens, are, descended, primarily, from, the, red, junglefowl, gallus, gallus, and, are, scientifically, classified, as, the, same, species, domesticated, chickens, freely, interbreed, with, populations, of, red, junglefowl, the, domestic, chicken, has, subsequently, hybridised, with, grey, junglefowl, sri, lankan, junglefowl, and, green, junglefowl, a, gene, for, yellow, skin, for, instance, was, incorporated, into, domestic, birds, from, the, grey, junglefowl, g, sonneratii, it, is, estimated, that, chickens, share, between, 71, and, 79, of, their, genome, with, red, junglefowl, according, to, one, early, study, a, single, domestication, event, of, the, red, junglefowl, in, present, day, thailand, gave, rise, to, the, modern, chicken, with, minor, transitions, separating, the, modern, breeds, the, red, junglefowl, is, well, adapted, to, take, advantage, of, the, vast, quantities, of, seed, produced, during, the, end, of, the, multi, decade, bamboo, seeding, cycle, to, boost, its, own, reproduction, in, domesticating, the, chicken, humans, took, advantage, of, the, red, junglefowl, s, ability, to, reproduce, prolifically, when, exposed, to, a, surge, in, its, food, supply, exactly, when, and, where, the, chicken, was, domesticated, remains, controversial, genomic, studies, estimate, that, the, chicken, was, domesticated, 8, 000, years, ago, in, southeast, asia, and, spread, to, china, and, india, 2, 000, to, 3, 000, years, later, archaeological, evidence, supports, domestic, chickens, in, southeast, asia, well, before, 6000, bc, china, by, 6000, bc, and, india, by, 2000, bc, a, landmark, 2020, nature, study, that, fully, sequenced, 863, chickens, across, the, world, suggests, that, all, domestic, chickens, originate, from, a, single, domestication, event, of, red, junglefowl, whose, present, day, distribution, is, predominantly, in, southwestern, china, northern, thailand, and, myanmar, these, domesticated, chickens, spread, across, southeast, and, south, asia, where, they, interbred, with, local, wild, species, of, junglefowl, forming, genetically, and, geographically, distinct, groups, analysis, of, the, most, popular, commercial, breed, shows, that, the, white, leghorn, breed, possesses, a, mosaic, of, divergent, ancestries, inherited, from, subspecies, of, red, junglefowl, a, word, for, the, domestic, chicken, manuk, is, part, of, the, reconstructed, proto, austronesian, language, indicating, they, were, domesticated, by, the, austronesian, peoples, since, ancient, times, chickens, together, with, dogs, and, pigs, were, carried, throughout, the, entire, range, of, the, prehistoric, austronesian, maritime, migrations, to, island, southeast, asia, micronesia, island, melanesia, polynesia, and, madagascar, starting, from, at, least, 3000, bc, from, taiwan, these, chickens, might, have, been, introduced, during, pre, columbian, times, to, south, america, via, polynesian, seafarers, but, evidence, for, this, is, still, putative, the, possibility, that, domestic, chickens, were, in, the, americas, before, western, contact, is, debated, by, researchers, but, blue, egged, chickens, found, only, in, the, americas, and, asia, suggest, an, asian, origin, for, early, american, chickens, a, lack, of, data, from, thailand, russia, the, indian, subcontinent, southeast, asia, and, sub, saharan, africa, makes, it, difficult, to, lay, out, a, clear, map, of, the, spread, of, chickens, in, these, areas, better, description, and, genetic, analysis, of, local, breeds, threatened, by, extinction, may, also, help, with, research, into, this, area, chicken, bones, from, the, arauco, peninsula, in, south, central, chile, were, radiocarbon, dated, as, pre, columbian, and, dna, analysis, suggested, they, were, related, to, prehistoric, populations, in, polynesia, however, further, study, of, the, same, bones, cast, doubt, on, the, findings, chicken, remains, have, been, difficult, to, date, given, the, small, and, fragile, bird, bones, this, may, account, for, discrepancies, in, dates, given, by, different, sources, archaeological, evidence, is, supplemented, by, mentions, in, historical, texts, from, the, last, few, centuries, bc, and, by, depictions, in, prehistoric, artworks, such, as, across, central, asia, chickens, were, widespread, throughout, southern, central, asia, by, the, 4th, century, bc, middle, eastern, chicken, remains, go, back, to, a, little, earlier, than, 2000, bc, in, syria, phoenicians, spread, chickens, along, the, mediterranean, coasts, as, far, as, iberia, during, the, hellenistic, period, 4th, 2nd, centuries, bc, in, the, southern, levant, chickens, began, to, be, widely, domesticated, for, food, the, first, pictures, of, chickens, in, europe, are, found, on, corinthian, pottery, of, the, 7th, century, bc, breeding, increased, under, the, roman, empire, and, reduced, in, the, middle, ages, genetic, sequencing, of, chicken, bones, from, archaeological, sites, in, europe, revealed, that, in, the, high, middle, ages, chickens, became, less, aggressive, and, began, to, lay, eggs, earlier, in, the, breeding, season, chickens, reached, egypt, via, the, middle, east, for, purposes, of, cockfighting, about, 1400, bc, and, became, widely, bred, in, egypt, around, 300, bc, three, possible, routes, of, introduction, into, africa, around, the, early, first, millennium, ad, could, have, been, through, the, egyptian, nile, valley, the, east, africa, roman, greek, or, indian, trade, or, from, carthage, and, the, berbers, across, the, sahara, the, earliest, known, remains, are, from, mali, nubia, east, coast, and, south, africa, and, date, back, to, the, middle, of, the, first, millennium, ad, chickens, are, susceptible, both, to, parasites, such, as, mites, and, to, diseases, caused, by, pathogens, such, as, bacteria, and, viruses, the, parasite, dermanyssus, gallinae, feeds, on, blood, causing, irritation, and, reducing, egg, production, and, acts, as, a, vector, for, bacterial, diseases, such, as, salmonellosis, and, spirochaetosis, viral, diseases, include, avian, influenza, chickens, are, common, and, widespread, domestic, animals, with, a, total, population, of, 23, 7, billion, as, of, 2018, more, than, 50, billion, chickens, are, reared, annually, as, a, source, of, meat, and, eggs, in, the, united, states, alone, more, than, 8, billion, chickens, are, slaughtered, each, year, for, meat, and, more, than, 300, million, chickens, are, reared, for, egg, production, the, vast, majority, of, poultry, is, raised, in, factory, farms, according, to, the, worldwatch, institute, 74, of, the, world, s, poultry, meat, and, 68, of, eggs, are, produced, this, way, an, alternative, to, intensive, poultry, farming, is, free, range, farming, friction, between, these, two, main, methods, has, led, to, long, term, issues, of, ethical, consumerism, opponents, of, intensive, farming, argue, that, it, harms, the, environment, creates, human, health, risks, and, is, inhumane, towards, sentient, animals, advocates, of, intensive, farming, say, that, their, efficient, systems, save, land, and, food, resources, owing, to, increased, productivity, and, that, the, animals, are, looked, after, in, a, controlled, environment, chickens, farmed, for, meat, are, called, broilers, broiler, breeds, typically, take, less, than, six, weeks, to, reach, slaughter, size, some, weeks, longer, for, free, range, and, organic, broilers, chickens, farmed, primarily, for, eggs, are, called, layer, hens, the, uk, alone, consumes, more, than, 34, million, eggs, per, day, hens, of, some, breeds, can, produce, over, 300, eggs, per, year, the, highest, authenticated, rate, of, egg, laying, is, 371, eggs, in, 364, days, after, 12, months, of, laying, the, commercial, hen, s, egg, laying, ability, declines, to, the, point, where, the, flock, is, commercially, unviable, hens, particularly, from, battery, cage, systems, are, sometimes, infirm, or, have, lost, a, significant, amount, of, their, feathers, and, their, life, expectancy, has, been, reduced, from, around, seven, years, to, less, than, two, years, in, the, uk, and, europe, laying, hens, are, then, slaughtered, and, used, in, processed, foods, or, sold, as, soup, hens, in, some, other, countries, flocks, are, sometimes, force, moulted, rather, than, being, slaughtered, to, re, invigorate, egg, laying, this, involves, complete, withdrawal, of, food, and, sometimes, water, for, 7, 14, days, or, sufficiently, long, to, cause, a, body, weight, loss, of, 25, to, 35, or, up, to, 28, days, under, experimental, conditions, this, stimulates, the, hen, to, lose, her, feathers, but, also, re, invigorates, egg, production, some, flocks, may, be, force, moulted, several, times, in, 2003, more, than, 75, of, all, flocks, were, moulted, in, the, us, keeping, chickens, as, pets, became, increasingly, popular, in, the, 2000s, among, urban, and, suburban, residents, many, people, obtain, chickens, for, their, egg, production, but, often, name, them, and, treat, them, as, any, other, pet, like, cats, or, dogs, chickens, provide, companionship, and, have, individual, personalities, while, many, do, not, cuddle, much, they, will, eat, from, one, s, hand, jump, onto, one, s, lap, respond, to, and, follow, their, handlers, as, well, as, show, affection, chickens, are, social, inquisitive, intelligent, birds, and, many, people, find, their, behaviour, entertaining, certain, breeds, such, as, silkies, and, many, bantam, varieties, are, generally, docile, and, are, often, recommended, as, good, pets, around, children, with, disabilities, a, cockfight, is, a, contest, held, in, a, ring, called, a, cockpit, between, two, cocks, cockfighting, is, outlawed, in, many, countries, as, involving, cruelty, to, animals, the, activity, seems, to, have, been, practised, in, the, indus, valley, civilisation, from, 2500, to, 2100, bc, in, the, process, of, domestication, chickens, were, apparently, kept, initially, for, cockfighting, and, only, later, used, for, food, chickens, have, long, been, used, as, model, organisms, to, study, developing, embryos, large, numbers, of, embryos, can, be, provided, commercially, fertilized, eggs, can, easily, be, opened, and, used, to, observe, the, developing, embryo, equally, important, embryologists, can, carry, out, experiments, on, such, embryos, close, the, egg, again, and, study, the, effects, later, in, development, for, instance, many, important, discoveries, in, limb, development, have, been, made, using, chicken, embryos, such, as, the, discovery, of, the, apical, ectodermal, ridge, and, the, zone, of, polarizing, activity, the, chicken, was, the, first, bird, species, to, have, its, genome, sequenced, at, 1, 21, gb, the, chicken, genome, is, similarly, sized, compared, to, other, birds, but, smaller, than, nearly, all, mammals, the, human, genome, is, 3, 2, gb, the, final, gene, set, contained, 26, 640, genes, including, noncoding, genes, and, pseudogenes, with, a, total, of, 19, 119, protein, coding, genes, a, similar, number, to, the, human, genome, in, 2006, scientists, researching, the, ancestry, of, birds, switched, on, a, chicken, recessive, gene, talpid2, and, found, that, the, embryo, jaws, initiated, formation, of, teeth, like, those, found, in, ancient, bird, fossils, chickens, are, featured, widely, in, folklore, religion, literature, and, popular, culture, the, chicken, is, a, sacred, animal, in, many, cultures, and, deeply, embedded, in, belief, systems, and, religious, practices, roosters, are, sometimes, used, for, divination, a, practice, called, alectryomancy, this, involves, the, sacrifice, of, a, sacred, rooster, often, during, a, ritual, cockfight, used, as, a, form, of, communication, with, the, gods, in, gabriel, garc, a, m,
