scabies, s, k, e, b, i, z, s, k, e, b, i, i, z, also, sometimes, known, as, the, seven, year, itch, is, a, contagious, human, skin, infestation, by, the, tiny, 0, 2, 0, 45, mm, mite, sarcoptes, scabiei, variety, hominis, the, word, is, from, latin, scabere, lit, to, scratch, the, most, common, symptoms, are, severe, itchiness, and, a, pimple, like, rash, occasionally, tiny, burrows, may, appear, on, the, skin, in, a, first, ever, infection, the, infected, person, usually, develops, symptoms, within, two, to, six, weeks, during, a, second, infection, symptoms, may, begin, within, 24, hours, these, symptoms, can, be, present, across, most, of, the, body, or, just, certain, areas, such, as, the, wrists, between, fingers, or, along, the, waistline, the, head, may, be, affected, but, this, is, typically, only, in, young, children, the, itch, is, often, worse, at, night, scratching, may, cause, skin, breakdown, and, an, additional, bacterial, infection, in, the, skin, scabies, is, caused, by, infection, with, the, female, mite, sarcoptes, scabiei, var, hominis, an, ectoparasite, the, mites, burrow, into, the, skin, to, live, and, deposit, eggs, the, symptoms, of, scabies, are, due, to, an, allergic, reaction, to, the, mites, often, only, between, 10, and, 15, mites, are, involved, in, an, infection, scabies, is, most, often, spread, during, a, relatively, long, period, of, direct, skin, contact, with, an, infected, person, at, least, 10, minutes, such, as, that, which, may, occur, during, sexual, activity, or, living, together, spread, of, the, disease, may, occur, even, if, the, person, has, not, developed, symptoms, yet, crowded, living, conditions, such, as, those, found, in, child, care, facilities, group, homes, and, prisons, increase, the, risk, of, spread, areas, with, a, lack, of, access, to, water, also, have, higher, rates, of, disease, crusted, scabies, is, a, more, severe, form, of, the, disease, not, essentially, different, but, an, infestation, by, very, large, numbers, of, mites, that, typically, only, affects, those, with, a, poor, immune, system, the, number, of, mites, also, makes, them, much, more, contagious, in, these, cases, spread, of, infection, may, occur, during, brief, contact, or, by, contaminated, objects, the, mite, is, very, small, and, at, the, limit, of, detection, with, the, human, eye, it, is, not, readily, obvious, factors, that, aid, in, detection, are, good, lighting, magnification, and, knowing, what, to, look, for, diagnosis, is, based, either, on, detecting, the, mite, confirmed, scabies, detecting, typical, lesions, in, a, typical, distribution, with, typical, historical, features, clinical, scabies, or, detecting, atypical, lesions, or, atypical, distribution, of, lesions, with, only, some, historical, features, present, suspected, scabies, several, medications, are, available, to, treat, those, infected, including, oral, and, topical, ivermectin, and, permethrin, crotamiton, and, lindane, creams, sexual, contacts, within, the, last, month, and, people, who, live, in, the, same, house, should, also, be, treated, at, the, same, time, bedding, and, clothing, used, in, the, last, three, days, should, be, washed, in, hot, water, and, dried, in, a, hot, dryer, as, the, mite, does, not, live, for, more, than, three, days, away, from, human, skin, more, washing, is, not, needed, symptoms, may, continue, for, two, to, four, weeks, following, treatment, if, after, this, time, symptoms, continue, retreatment, may, be, needed, scabies, is, one, of, the, three, most, common, skin, disorders, in, children, along, with, ringworm, and, bacterial, skin, infections, as, of, 2015, it, affects, about, 204, million, people, 2, 8, of, the, world, population, it, is, equally, common, in, both, sexes, the, young, and, the, old, are, more, commonly, affected, it, also, occurs, more, commonly, in, the, developing, world, and, tropical, climates, other, animals, do, not, spread, human, scabies, similar, infection, in, other, animals, is, known, as, sarcoptic, mange, and, is, typically, caused, by, slightly, different, but, related, mites, the, characteristic, symptoms, of, a, scabies, infection, include, intense, itching, and, superficial, burrows, because, the, host, develops, the, symptoms, as, a, reaction, to, the, mites, presence, over, time, typically, a, delay, of, four, to, six, weeks, occurs, between, the, onset, of, infestation, and, the, onset, of, itching, similarly, symptoms, often, persist, for, one, to, several, weeks, after, successful, eradication, of, the, mites, as, noted, those, re, exposed, to, scabies, after, successful, treatment, may, exhibit, symptoms, of, the, new, infestation, in, a, much, shorter, period, as, little, as, one, to, four, days, in, the, classic, scenario, the, itch, is, made, worse, by, warmth, and, is, usually, experienced, as, being, worse, at, night, possibly, because, distractions, are, fewer, as, a, symptom, it, is, less, common, in, the, elderly, the, superficial, burrows, of, scabies, usually, occur, in, the, area, of, the, finger, webs, feet, ventral, wrists, elbows, back, buttocks, and, external, genitals, except, in, infants, and, the, immunosuppressed, infection, generally, does, not, occur, in, the, skin, of, the, face, or, scalp, the, burrows, are, created, by, excavation, of, the, adult, mite, in, the, epidermis, acropustulosis, or, blisters, and, pustules, on, the, palms, and, soles, of, the, feet, are, characteristic, symptoms, of, scabies, in, infants, in, most, people, the, trails, of, the, burrowing, mites, are, linear, or, s, shaped, tracks, in, the, skin, often, accompanied, by, rows, of, small, pimple, like, mosquito, or, insect, bites, lesions, are, symmetrical, and, mainly, affect, the, hands, wrists, axillae, thighs, buttocks, waist, soles, of, the, feet, areola, and, vulva, in, females, and, penis, and, scrotum, in, males, the, neck, and, above, are, usually, not, affected, except, in, cases, of, crusted, scabies, and, in, infestations, of, infants, the, elderly, and, the, immunocompromised, symptoms, typically, appear, two, to, six, weeks, after, infestation, for, individuals, never, before, exposed, to, scabies, for, those, having, been, previously, exposed, the, symptoms, can, appear, within, several, days, after, infestation, however, symptoms, may, appear, after, several, months, or, years, the, elderly, disabled, and, people, with, impaired, immune, systems, such, as, those, with, hiv, aids, cancer, or, those, on, immunosuppressive, medications, are, susceptible, to, crusted, scabies, also, called, norwegian, scabies, on, those, with, weaker, immune, systems, the, host, becomes, a, more, fertile, breeding, ground, for, the, mites, which, spread, over, the, host, s, body, except, the, face, the, mites, in, crusted, scabies, are, not, more, virulent, than, in, noncrusted, scabies, but, are, much, more, numerous, sometimes, up, to, two, million, people, with, crusted, scabies, exhibit, scaly, rashes, slight, itching, and, thick, crusts, of, skin, that, contain, large, numbers, of, scabies, mites, for, this, reason, persons, with, crusted, scabies, are, more, contagious, to, others, than, those, with, typical, scabies, such, areas, make, eradication, of, mites, particularly, difficult, as, the, crusts, protect, the, mites, from, topical, miticides, scabicides, necessitating, prolonged, treatment, of, these, areas, in, the, 18th, century, italian, biologists, giovanni, cosimo, bonomo, and, diacinto, cestoni, 1637, 1718, described, the, mite, now, called, sarcoptes, scabiei, variety, hominis, as, the, cause, of, scabies, sarcoptes, is, a, genus, of, skin, parasites, and, part, of, the, larger, family, of, mites, collectively, known, as, scab, mites, these, organisms, have, eight, legs, as, adults, and, are, placed, in, the, same, phylogenetic, class, arachnida, as, spiders, and, ticks, s, scabiei, mites, are, under, 0, 5, mm, in, size, they, are, sometimes, visible, as, pinpoints, of, white, gravid, females, tunnel, into, the, dead, outermost, layer, stratum, corneum, of, a, host, s, skin, and, deposit, eggs, in, the, shallow, burrows, the, eggs, hatch, into, larvae, in, three, to, ten, days, these, young, mites, move, about, on, the, skin, and, molt, into, a, nymphal, stage, before, maturing, as, adults, which, live, three, to, four, weeks, in, the, host, s, skin, males, roam, on, top, of, the, skin, occasionally, burrowing, into, the, skin, in, general, the, total, number, of, adult, mites, infesting, a, healthy, hygienic, person, with, non, crusted, scabies, is, small, about, 11, females, in, burrows, on, average, the, movement, of, mites, within, and, on, the, skin, produces, an, intense, itch, which, has, the, characteristics, of, a, delayed, cell, mediated, inflammatory, response, to, allergens, ige, antibodies, are, present, in, the, serum, and, the, site, of, infection, which, react, to, multiple, protein, allergens, in, the, body, of, the, mite, some, of, these, cross, react, to, allergens, from, house, dust, mites, immediate, antibody, mediated, allergic, reactions, wheals, have, been, elicited, in, infected, persons, but, not, in, those, not, infected, immediate, hypersensitivity, of, this, type, is, thought, to, explain, the, observed, far, more, rapid, allergic, skin, response, to, reinfection, seen, in, persons, who, have, been, infected, previously, especially, within, the, previous, year, or, two, scabies, is, contagious, and, can, be, contracted, through, prolonged, physical, contact, with, an, infested, person, this, includes, sexual, intercourse, although, a, majority, of, cases, are, acquired, through, other, forms, of, skin, to, skin, contact, less, commonly, scabies, infestation, can, happen, through, the, sharing, of, clothes, towels, and, bedding, but, this, is, not, a, major, mode, of, transmission, individual, mites, can, survive, for, only, two, to, three, days, at, most, away, from, human, skin, at, room, temperature, as, with, lice, a, latex, condom, is, ineffective, against, scabies, transmission, during, intercourse, because, mites, typically, migrate, from, one, individual, to, the, next, at, sites, other, than, the, sex, organs, healthcare, workers, are, at, risk, of, contracting, scabies, from, patients, because, they, may, be, in, extended, contact, with, them, the, symptoms, are, caused, by, an, allergic, reaction, of, the, host, s, body, to, mite, proteins, though, exactly, which, proteins, remains, a, topic, of, study, the, mite, proteins, are, also, present, from, the, gut, in, mite, feces, which, are, deposited, under, the, skin, the, allergic, reaction, is, both, of, the, delayed, cell, mediated, and, immediate, antibody, mediated, type, and, involves, ige, antibodies, are, presumed, to, mediate, the, very, rapid, symptoms, on, reinfection, the, allergy, type, symptoms, itching, continue, for, some, days, and, even, several, weeks, after, all, mites, are, killed, new, lesions, may, appear, for, a, few, days, after, mites, are, eradicated, nodular, lesions, from, scabies, may, continue, to, be, symptomatic, for, weeks, after, the, mites, have, been, killed, rates, of, scabies, are, negatively, related, to, temperature, and, positively, related, to, humidity, scabies, may, be, diagnosed, clinically, in, geographical, areas, where, it, is, common, when, diffuse, itching, presents, along, with, either, lesions, in, two, typical, spots, or, itchiness, is, present, in, another, household, member, the, classical, sign, of, scabies, is, the, burrow, made, by, a, mite, within, the, skin, to, detect, the, burrow, the, suspected, area, is, rubbed, with, ink, from, a, fountain, pen, or, a, topical, tetracycline, solution, which, glows, under, a, special, light, the, skin, is, then, wiped, with, an, alcohol, pad, if, the, person, is, infected, with, scabies, the, characteristic, zigzag, or, s, pattern, of, the, burrow, will, appear, across, the, skin, however, interpreting, this, test, may, be, difficult, as, the, burrows, are, scarce, and, may, be, obscured, by, scratch, marks, a, definitive, diagnosis, is, made, by, finding, either, the, scabies, mites, or, their, eggs, and, fecal, pellets, searches, for, these, signs, involve, either, scraping, a, suspected, area, mounting, the, sample, in, potassium, hydroxide, and, examining, it, under, a, microscope, or, using, dermoscopy, to, examine, the, skin, directly, symptoms, of, early, scabies, infestation, mirror, other, skin, diseases, including, dermatitis, syphilis, erythema, multiforme, various, urticaria, related, syndromes, allergic, reactions, ringworm, related, diseases, and, other, ectoparasites, such, as, lice, and, fleas, mass, treatment, programs, that, use, topical, permethrin, or, oral, ivermectin, have, been, effective, in, reducing, the, prevalence, of, scabies, in, a, number, of, populations, no, vaccine, is, available, for, scabies, the, simultaneous, treatment, of, all, close, contacts, is, recommended, even, if, they, show, no, symptoms, of, infection, asymptomatic, to, reduce, rates, of, recurrence, since, mites, can, survive, for, only, two, to, three, days, without, a, host, other, objects, in, the, environment, pose, little, risk, of, transmission, except, in, the, case, of, crusted, scabies, therefore, cleaning, is, of, little, importance, rooms, used, by, those, with, crusted, scabies, require, thorough, cleaning, several, medications, are, effective, in, treating, scabies, treatment, should, involve, the, entire, household, and, any, others, who, have, had, recent, prolonged, contact, with, the, infested, individual, in, addition, to, treating, the, infestation, options, to, control, itchiness, include, antihistamines, and, prescription, anti, inflammatory, agents, bedding, clothing, and, towels, used, during, the, previous, three, days, should, be, washed, in, hot, water, and, dried, in, a, hot, dryer, treatment, protocols, for, crusted, scabies, are, significantly, more, intense, than, for, common, scabies, permethrin, a, pyrethroid, insecticide, is, the, most, effective, treatment, for, scabies, and, remains, the, treatment, of, choice, it, is, applied, from, the, neck, down, usually, before, sleep, and, left, on, for, about, eight, to, 14, hours, then, washed, off, in, the, morning, care, should, be, taken, to, coat, the, entire, skin, surface, not, just, symptomatic, areas, any, patch, of, skin, left, untreated, can, provide, a, safe, haven, for, one, or, more, mites, to, survive, one, application, is, normally, sufficient, as, permethrin, kills, eggs, and, hatchlings, as, well, as, adult, mites, though, many, physicians, recommend, a, second, application, three, to, seven, days, later, as, a, precaution, crusted, scabies, may, require, multiple, applications, or, supplemental, treatment, with, oral, ivermectin, below, permethrin, may, cause, slight, irritation, of, the, skin, that, is, usually, tolerable, in, recent, years, concern, is, growing, about, permethrin, resistant, scabies, though, there, are, some, researchers, who, call, this, a, case, of, pseudo, resistance, oral, ivermectin, is, effective, in, eradicating, scabies, often, in, a, single, dose, it, is, the, treatment, of, choice, for, crusted, scabies, and, is, sometimes, prescribed, in, combination, with, a, topical, agent, it, has, not, been, tested, on, infants, and, is, not, recommended, for, children, under, six, years, of, age, topical, ivermectin, preparations, have, been, shown, to, be, effective, for, scabies, in, adults, it, has, also, been, useful, for, sarcoptic, mange, the, veterinary, analog, of, human, scabies, one, review, found, that, the, efficacy, of, permethrin, is, similar, to, that, of, systemic, or, topical, ivermectin, a, separate, review, found, that, although, oral, ivermectin, is, usually, effective, for, treatment, of, scabies, it, does, have, a, higher, treatment, failure, rate, than, topical, permethrin, another, review, found, that, oral, ivermectin, provided, a, reasonable, balance, between, efficacy, and, safety, a, study, has, demonstrated, that, scabies, is, markedly, reduced, in, populations, taking, ivermectin, regularly, the, drug, is, widely, used, for, treating, scabies, and, other, parasitic, diseases, particularly, among, the, poor, and, disadvantaged, in, the, tropics, beginning, with, the, developer, merck, providing, the, drug, at, no, cost, to, treat, onchocerciasis, from, 1987, other, treatments, include, lindane, benzyl, benzoate, crotamiton, malathion, and, sulfur, preparations, lindane, is, effective, but, concerns, over, potential, neurotoxicity, have, limited, its, availability, in, many, countries, it, is, banned, in, california, but, may, be, used, in, other, states, as, a, second, line, treatment, sulfur, ointments, or, benzyl, benzoate, are, often, used, in, the, developing, world, due, to, their, low, cost, some, 10, sulfur, solutions, have, been, shown, to, be, effective, and, sulfur, ointments, are, typically, used, for, at, least, a, week, though, many, people, find, the, odor, of, sulfur, products, unpleasant, crotamiton, has, been, found, to, be, less, effective, than, permethrin, in, limited, studies, crotamiton, or, sulfur, preparations, are, sometimes, recommended, instead, of, permethrin, for, children, due, to, concerns, over, dermal, absorption, of, permethrin, scabies, is, endemic, in, many, developing, countries, where, it, tends, to, be, particularly, problematic, in, rural, and, remote, areas, in, such, settings, community, wide, control, strategies, are, required, to, reduce, the, rate, of, disease, as, treatment, of, only, individuals, is, ineffective, due, to, the, high, rate, of, reinfection, large, scale, mass, drug, administration, strategies, may, be, required, where, coordinated, interventions, aim, to, treat, whole, communities, in, one, concerted, effort, although, such, strategies, have, shown, to, be, able, to, reduce, the, burden, of, scabies, in, these, kinds, of, communities, debate, remains, about, the, best, strategy, to, adopt, including, the, choice, of, drug, the, resources, required, to, implement, such, large, scale, interventions, in, a, cost, effective, and, sustainable, way, are, significant, furthermore, since, endemic, scabies, is, largely, restricted, to, poor, and, remote, areas, it, is, a, public, health, issue, that, has, not, attracted, much, attention, from, policy, makers, and, international, donors, scabies, is, one, of, the, three, most, common, skin, disorders, in, children, along, with, tinea, and, pyoderma, as, of, 2010, it, affects, about, 100, million, people, 1, 5, of, the, population, and, its, frequency, is, not, related, to, gender, the, mites, are, distributed, around, the, world, and, equally, infect, all, ages, races, and, socioeconomic, classes, in, different, climates, scabies, is, more, often, seen, in, crowded, areas, with, unhygienic, living, conditions, globally, as, of, 2009, an, estimated, 300, million, cases, of, scabies, occur, each, year, although, various, parties, claim, the, figure, is, either, over, or, underestimated, about, 1, 10, of, the, global, population, is, estimated, to, be, infected, with, scabies, but, in, certain, populations, the, infection, rate, may, be, as, high, as, 50, 80, scabies, has, been, observed, in, humans, since, ancient, times, archeological, evidence, from, egypt, and, the, middle, east, suggests, scabies, was, present, as, early, as, 494, bc, in, the, fourth, century, bc, aristotle, reported, on, lice, that, escape, from, little, pimples, if, they, are, pricked, a, description, consistent, with, scabies, arab, physician, ibn, zuhr, is, believed, to, have, been, the, first, to, provide, a, clinical, description, of, the, scabies, mites, roman, encyclopedist, and, medical, writer, aulus, cornelius, celsus, circa, 25, bc, 50, ad, is, credited, with, naming, the, disease, scabies, and, describing, its, characteristic, features, the, parasitic, etiology, of, scabies, was, documented, by, italian, physician, giovanni, cosimo, bonomo, 1663, 1696, in, his, 1687, letter, observations, concerning, the, fleshworms, of, the, human, body, bonomo, s, description, established, scabies, as, one, of, the, first, human, diseases, with, a, well, understood, cause, in, europe, in, the, late, 19th, through, mid, 20th, centuries, a, sulfur, bearing, ointment, called, by, the, medical, eponym, of, wilkinson, s, ointment, was, widely, used, for, topical, treatment, of, scabies, the, contents, and, origins, of, several, versions, of, the, ointment, were, detailed, in, correspondence, published, in, the, british, medical, journal, in, 1945, in, the, 1995, documentary, anne, frank, remembered, bloeme, evers, emden, told, of, how, she, was, selected, from, auschwitz, and, sent, to, a, work, camp, where, conditions, were, sufficiently, improved, that, she, was, able, to, survive, until, the, liberation, she, said, anne, frank, was, rejected, for, this, transfer, because, she, had, contracted, scabies, scabies, may, occur, in, a, number, of, domestic, and, wild, animals, the, mites, that, cause, these, infestations, are, of, different, subspecies, from, the, one, typically, causing, the, human, form, these, subspecies, can, infest, animals, that, are, not, their, usual, hosts, but, such, infections, do, not, last, long, scabies, infected, animals, experience, severe, itching, and, secondary, skin, infections, they, often, lose, weight, and, become, frail, the, most, frequently, diagnosed, form, of, scabies, in, domestic, animals, is, sarcoptic, mange, caused, by, the, subspecies, sarcoptes, scabiei, canis, most, commonly, in, dogs, and, cats, sarcoptic, mange, is, transmissible, to, humans, who, come, into, prolonged, contact, with, infested, animals, and, is, distinguished, from, human, scabies, by, its, distribution, on, skin, surfaces, covered, by, clothing, scabies, infected, domestic, fowl, develop, what, is, known, as, scaly, leg, domestic, animals, that, have, gone, feral, and, have, no, veterinary, care, are, frequently, affected, by, scabies, and, a, host, of, other, ailments, nondomestic, animals, have, also, been, observed, to, develop, scabies, gorillas, for, instance, are, known, to, be, susceptible, to, infection, by, contact, with, items, used, by, humans, and, it, is, a, fatal, disease, of, wombats, scabies, is, also, a, concern, for, cattle, the, international, alliance, for, the, control, of, scabies, was, started, in, 2012, and, brings, together, over, 150, researchers, clinicians, and, public, health, experts, from, more, than, 15, countries, it, has, managed, to, bring, the, global, health, implications, of, scabies, to, the, attention, of, the, world, health, organization, who, consequently, the, who, has, included, scabies, on, its, official, list, of, neglected, tropical, diseases, and, other, neglected, conditions, moxidectin, is, being, evaluated, as, a, treatment, for, scabies, it, is, established, in, veterinary, medicine, to, treat, a, range, of, parasites, including, sarcoptic, mange, its, advantage, over, ivermectin, is, its, longer, half, life, in, humans, thus, potential, duration, of, action, tea, tree, oil, tto, exhibits, scabicidal, action, in, a, laboratory, setting
