sister, cercopithecoidea, apes, collectively, hominoidea, h, m, n, d, i, are, a, clade, of, old, world, simians, native, to, sub, saharan, africa, and, southeast, asia, though, they, were, more, widespread, in, africa, most, of, asia, and, europe, in, prehistory, which, together, with, its, sister, group, cercopithecidae, form, the, catarrhine, clade, cladistically, making, them, monkeys, apes, do, not, have, tails, due, to, a, mutation, of, the, tbxt, gene, in, traditional, and, non, scientific, use, the, term, ape, can, include, tailless, primates, taxonomically, considered, cercopithecidae, such, as, the, barbary, ape, and, black, ape, and, is, thus, not, equivalent, to, the, scientific, taxon, hominoidea, there, are, two, extant, branches, of, the, superfamily, hominoidea, the, gibbons, or, lesser, apes, and, the, hominids, or, great, apes, except, for, gorillas, and, humans, hominoids, are, agile, climbers, of, trees, apes, eat, a, variety, of, plant, and, animal, foods, with, the, majority, of, food, being, plant, foods, which, can, include, fruits, leaves, stalks, roots, and, seeds, including, nuts, and, grass, seeds, human, diets, are, sometimes, substantially, different, from, that, of, other, hominoids, due, in, part, to, the, development, of, technology, and, a, wide, range, of, habitation, all, non, human, hominoids, are, rare, and, threatened, with, extinction, the, eastern, hoolock, gibbon, is, the, least, threatened, only, being, vulnerable, to, extinction, five, gibbon, species, are, critically, endangered, as, are, all, species, of, orangutan, and, gorilla, the, remaining, species, of, gibbon, the, bonobo, and, all, four, subspecies, of, chimpanzees, are, endangered, the, chief, threat, to, most, of, the, endangered, species, is, loss, of, tropical, rainforest, habitat, though, some, populations, are, further, imperiled, by, hunting, for, bushmeat, the, great, apes, of, africa, are, also, facing, threat, from, the, ebola, virus, currently, considered, to, be, the, greatest, threat, to, survival, of, african, apes, ebola, infection, is, responsible, for, the, death, of, at, least, one, third, of, all, gorillas, and, chimpanzees, since, 1990, ape, from, old, english, apa, is, a, word, of, uncertain, origin, the, term, has, a, history, of, rather, imprecise, usage, and, of, comedic, or, punning, usage, in, the, vernacular, its, earliest, meaning, was, generally, of, any, non, human, anthropoid, primate, as, is, still, the, case, for, its, cognates, in, other, germanic, languages, later, after, the, term, monkey, had, been, introduced, into, english, ape, was, specialized, to, refer, to, a, tailless, therefore, exceptionally, human, like, primate, thus, the, term, ape, obtained, two, different, meanings, as, shown, in, the, 1911, encyclop, dia, britannica, entry, it, could, be, used, as, a, synonym, for, monkey, and, it, could, denote, the, tailless, human, like, primate, in, particular, some, or, recently, all, hominoids, are, also, called, apes, but, the, term, is, used, broadly, and, has, several, different, senses, within, both, popular, and, scientific, settings, ape, has, been, used, as, a, synonym, for, monkey, or, for, naming, any, primate, with, a, human, like, appearance, particularly, those, without, a, tail, biologists, have, traditionally, used, the, term, ape, to, mean, a, member, of, the, superfamily, hominoidea, other, than, humans, but, more, recently, to, mean, all, members, of, hominoidea, so, ape, not, to, be, confused, with, great, ape, now, becomes, another, word, for, hominoid, including, humans, the, taxonomic, term, hominoid, is, derived, from, and, intended, as, encompassing, the, hominids, the, family, of, great, apes, both, terms, were, introduced, by, gray, 1825, the, term, hominins, is, also, due, to, gray, 1824, intended, as, including, the, human, lineage, see, also, hominidae, terminology, human, taxonomy, the, distinction, between, apes, and, monkeys, is, complicated, by, the, traditional, paraphyly, of, monkeys, apes, emerged, as, a, sister, group, of, old, world, monkeys, in, the, catarrhines, which, are, a, sister, group, of, new, world, monkeys, therefore, cladistically, apes, catarrhines, and, related, contemporary, extinct, groups, such, as, parapithecidae, are, monkeys, as, well, for, any, consistent, definition, of, monkey, old, world, monkey, may, also, legitimately, be, taken, to, be, meant, to, include, all, the, catarrhines, including, apes, and, extinct, species, such, as, aegyptopithecus, in, which, case, the, apes, cercopithecoidea, and, aegyptopithecus, emerged, within, the, old, world, monkeys, the, primates, called, apes, today, became, known, to, europeans, after, the, 18th, century, as, zoological, knowledge, developed, it, became, clear, that, taillessness, occurred, in, a, number, of, different, and, otherwise, distantly, related, species, sir, wilfrid, le, gros, clark, was, one, of, those, primatologists, who, developed, the, idea, that, there, were, trends, in, primate, evolution, and, that, the, extant, members, of, the, order, could, be, arranged, in, an, ascending, series, leading, from, monkeys, to, apes, to, humans, within, this, tradition, ape, came, to, refer, to, all, members, of, the, superfamily, hominoidea, except, humans, as, such, this, use, of, apes, represented, a, paraphyletic, grouping, meaning, that, even, though, all, species, of, apes, were, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, this, grouping, did, not, include, all, the, descendant, species, because, humans, were, excluded, from, being, among, the, apes, traditionally, the, english, language, vernacular, name, apes, does, not, include, humans, but, phylogenetically, humans, homo, form, part, of, the, family, hominidae, within, hominoidea, thus, there, are, at, least, three, common, or, traditional, uses, of, the, term, ape, non, specialists, may, not, distinguish, between, monkeys, and, apes, that, is, they, may, use, the, two, terms, interchangeably, or, they, may, use, ape, for, any, tailless, monkey, or, non, human, hominoid, or, they, may, use, the, term, ape, to, just, mean, the, non, human, hominoids, modern, taxonomy, aims, for, the, use, of, monophyletic, groups, for, taxonomic, classification, some, literature, may, now, use, the, common, name, ape, to, mean, all, members, of, the, superfamily, hominoidea, including, humans, for, example, in, his, 2005, book, benton, wrote, the, apes, hominoidea, today, include, the, gibbons, and, orang, utan, the, gorilla, and, chimpanzee, and, humans, modern, biologists, and, primatologists, refer, to, apes, that, are, not, human, as, non, human, apes, scientists, broadly, other, than, paleoanthropologists, may, use, the, term, hominin, to, identify, the, human, clade, replacing, the, term, hominid, see, terminology, of, primate, names, see, below, history, of, hominoid, taxonomy, for, a, discussion, of, changes, in, scientific, classification, and, terminology, regarding, hominoids, although, the, hominoid, fossil, record, is, still, incomplete, and, fragmentary, there, is, now, enough, evidence, to, provide, an, outline, of, the, evolutionary, history, of, humans, previously, the, divergence, between, humans, and, other, extant, hominoids, was, thought, to, have, occurred, 15, to, 20, million, years, ago, and, several, species, of, that, time, period, such, as, ramapithecus, were, once, thought, to, be, hominins, and, possible, ancestors, of, humans, but, later, fossil, finds, indicated, that, ramapithecus, was, more, closely, related, to, the, orangutan, and, new, biochemical, evidence, indicates, that, the, last, common, ancestor, of, humans, and, non, hominins, that, is, the, chimpanzees, occurred, between, 5, and, 10, million, years, ago, and, probably, nearer, the, lower, end, of, that, range, more, recent, see, chimpanzee, human, last, common, ancestor, chlca, genetic, analysis, combined, with, fossil, evidence, indicates, that, hominoids, diverged, from, the, old, world, monkeys, about, 25, million, years, ago, mya,

recent, evidence, has, changed, our, understanding, of, the, relationships, between, the, hominoids, especially, regarding, the, human, lineage, and, the, traditionally, used, terms, have, become, somewhat, confused, competing, approaches, to, methodology, and, terminology, are, found, among, current, scientific, sources, over, time, authorities, have, changed, the, names, and, the, meanings,

dna, sequences, has, changed, the, understanding, of, relationships, between, hominoids, there, has, been, a, gradual, demotion, of, humans, from, being, special, in, the, taxonomy, to, being, one, branch, among, many, this, recent, turmoil, of, history, illustrates, the, growing, influence, on, all, taxonomy, of, cladistics, the, science, of, classifying, living, things, strictly, according, to, their, lines, of, descent, today, there, are, eight, extant, genera, of, hominoids, they, are, the, four, genera, in, the, family, hominidae, namely, homo, pan, gorilla, and, pongo, plus, four, genera, in, the, family, hylobatidae, gibbons, hylobates, hoolock, nomascus, and, symphalangus, the, two, subspecies, of, hoolock, gibbons, were, recently, moved, from, the, genus, bunopithecus, to, the, new, genus, hoolock, and, re, ranked, as, species, a, third, species, was, described, in, january, 2017, in, 1758, carl, linnaeus, relying, on, second, or, third, hand, accounts, placed, a, second, species, in, homo, along, with, h, sapiens, homo, troglodytes, cave, dwelling, man, although, the, term, orang, outang, is, listed, as, a, variety, homo, sylvestris, under, this, species, it, is, nevertheless, not, clear, to, which, animal, this, name, refers, as, linnaeus, had, no, specimen, to, refer, to, hence, no, precise, description, linnaeus, may, have, based, homo, troglodytes, on, reports, of, mythical, creatures, then, unidentified, simians, or, asian, natives, dressed, in, animal, skins, linnaeus, named, the, orangutan, simia, satyrus, satyr, monkey, he, placed, the, three, genera, homo, simia, and, lemur, in, the, order, of, primates, the, troglodytes, name, was, used, for, the, chimpanzee, by, blumenbach, in, 1775, but, moved, to, the, genus, simia, the, orangutan, was, moved, to, the, genus, pongo, in, 1799, by, lac, p, de, linnaeus, s, inclusion, of, humans, in, the, primates, with, monkeys, and, apes, was, troubling, for, people, who, denied, a, close, relationship, between, humans, and, the, rest, of, the, animal, kingdom, linnaeus, s, lutheran, archbishop, had, accused, him, of, impiety, in, a, letter, to, johann, georg, gmelin, dated, 25, february, 1747, linnaeus, wrote, it, is, not, pleasing, to, me, that, i, must, place, humans, among, the, primates, but, man, is, intimately, familiar, with, himself, let, s, not, quibble, over, words, it, will, be, the, same, to, me, whatever, name, is, applied, but, i, desperately, seek, from, you, and, from, the, whole, world, a, general, difference, between, men, and, simians, from, the, principles, of, natural, history, i, certainly, know, of, none, if, only, someone, might, tell, me, one, if, i, called, man, a, simian, or, vice, versa, i, would, bring, together, all, the, theologians, against, me, perhaps, i, ought, to, in, accordance, with, the, law, of, natural, history, accordingly, johann, friedrich, blumenbach, in, the, first, edition, of, his, manual, of, natural, history, 1779, proposed, that, the, primates, be, divided, into, the, quadrumana, four, handed, i, e, apes, and, monkeys, and, bimana, two, handed, i, e, humans, this, distinction, was, taken, up, by, other, naturalists, most, notably, georges, cuvier, some, elevated, the, distinction, to, the, level, of, order, however, the, many, affinities, between, humans, and, other, primates, and, especially, the, great, apes, made, it, clear, that, the, distinction, made, no, scientific, sense, in, his, 1871, book, the, descent, of, man, and, selection, in, relation, to, sex, charles, darwin, wrote, the, greater, number, of, naturalists, who, have, taken, into, consideration, the, whole, structure, of, man, including, his, mental, faculties, have, followed, blumenbach, and, cuvier, and, have, placed, man, in, a, separate, order, under, the, title, of, the, bimana, and, therefore, on, an, equality, with, the, orders, of, the, quadrumana, carnivora, etc, recently, many, of, our, best, naturalists, have, recurred, to, the, view, first, propounded, by, linnaeus, so, remarkable, for, his, sagacity, and, have, placed, man, in, the, same, order, with, the, quadrumana, under, the, title, of, the, primates, the, justice, of, this, conclusion, will, be, admitted, for, in, the, first, place, we, must, bear, in, mind, the, comparative, insignificance, for, classification, of, the, great, development, of, the, brain, in, man, and, that, the, strongly, marked, differences, between, the, skulls, of, man, and, the, quadrumana, lately, insisted, upon, by, bischoff, aeby, and, others, apparently, follow, from, their, differently, developed, brains, in, the, second, place, we, must, remember, that, nearly, all, the, other, and, more, important, differences, between, man, and, the, quadrumana, are, manifestly, adaptive, in, their, nature, and, relate, chiefly, to, the, erect, position, of, man, such, as, the, structure, of, his, hand, foot, and, pelvis, the, curvature, of, his, spine, and, the, position, of, his, head, the, lesser, apes, are, the, gibbon, family, hylobatidae, of, sixteen, species, all, are, native, to, asia, their, major, differentiating, characteristic, is, their, long, arms, which, they, use, to, brachiate, through, trees, their, wrists, are, ball, and, socket, joints, as, an, evolutionary, adaptation, to, their, arboreal, lifestyle, generally, smaller, than, the, african, apes, the, largest, gibbon, the, siamang, weighs, up, to, 14, kg, 31, lb, in, comparison, the, smallest, great, ape, the, bonobo, is, 34, to, 60, kg, 75, to, 132, lb, the, superfamily, hominoidea, falls, within, the, parvorder, catarrhini, which, also, includes, the, old, world, monkeys, of, africa, and, eurasia, within, this, grouping, the, two, families, hylobatidae, and, hominidae, can, be, distinguished, from, old, world, monkeys, by, the, number, of, cusps, on, their, molars, hominoids, have, five, in, the, y, 5, molar, pattern, whereas, old, world, monkeys, have, only, four, in, a, bilophodont, pattern, further, in, comparison, with, old, world, monkeys, hominoids, are, noted, for, more, mobile, shoulder, joints, and, arms, due, to, the, dorsal, position, of, the, scapula, broader, ribcages, that, are, flatter, front, to, back, and, a, shorter, less, mobile, spine, with, greatly, reduced, caudal, tail, vertebrae, resulting, in, complete, loss, of, the, tail, in, extant, hominoid, species, these, are, anatomical, adaptations, first, to, vertical, hanging, and, swinging, locomotion, brachiation, and, later, to, developing, balance, in, a, bipedal, pose, note, there, are, primates, in, other, families, that, also, lack, tails, and, at, least, one, the, pig, tailed, langur, is, known, to, walk, significant, distances, bipedally, the, front, of, the, ape, skull, is, characterised, by, its, sinuses, fusion, of, the, frontal, bone, and, by, post, orbital, constriction, cladistically, apes, catarrhines, and, extinct, species, such, as, aegyptopithecus, and, parapithecidaea, are, monkeys, so, one, can, only, specify, ape, features, not, present, in, other, monkeys, unlike, most, monkeys, apes, do, not, possess, a, tail, monkeys, are, more, likely, to, be, in, trees, and, use, their, tails, for, balance, while, the, great, apes, are, considerably, larger, than, monkeys, gibbons, lesser, apes, are, smaller, than, some, monkeys, apes, are, considered, to, be, more, intelligent, than, monkeys, which, are, considered, to, have, more, primitive, brains, the, enzyme, urate, oxidase, has, become, inactive, in, all, apes, its, function, having, been, lost, in, two, primate, lineages, during, the, middle, miocene, first, in, the, common, ancestors, of, hominidae, and, later, in, the, common, ancestor, of, hylobatidae, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, in, both, incidents, it, was, a, mutation, that, occurred, in, apes, living, in, europe, when, the, climate, was, getting, colder, leading, to, starvation, during, winter, the, mutation, changed, the, biochemistry, of, the, apes, and, made, it, easier, to, accumulate, fat, which, allowed, the, animals, to, survive, longer, periods, of, starvation, when, they, migrated, to, asia, and, africa, this, genetic, trait, remained, major, studies, of, behaviour, in, the, field, were, completed, on, the, three, better, known, great, apes, for, example, by, jane, goodall, dian, fossey, and, birut, galdikas, these, studies, have, shown, that, in, their, natural, environments, the, non, human, hominoids, show, sharply, varying, social, structure, gibbons, are, monogamous, territorial, pair, bonders, orangutans, are, solitary, gorillas, live, in, small, troops, with, a, single, adult, male, leader, while, chimpanzees, live, in, larger, troops, with, bonobos, exhibiting, promiscuous, sexual, behaviour, their, diets, also, vary, gorillas, are, foliovores, while, the, others, are, all, primarily, frugivores, although, the, common, chimpanzee, hunts, for, meat, foraging, behaviour, is, correspondingly, variable, in, november, 2023, scientists, reported, for, the, first, time, evidence, that, groups, of, primates, including, apes, and, particularly, bonobos, are, capable, of, cooperating, with, each, other, apart, from, humans, and, gorillas, apes, eat, a, predominantly, frugivorous, diet, mostly, fruit, but, supplemented, with, a, variety, of, other, foods, gorillas, are, predominantly, folivorous, eating, mostly, stalks, shoots, roots, and, leaves, with, some, fruit, and, other, foods, non, human, apes, usually, eat, a, small, amount, of, raw, animal, foods, such, as, insects, or, eggs, in, the, case, of, humans, migration, and, the, invention, of, hunting, tools, and, cooking, has, led, to, an, even, wider, variety, of, foods, and, diets, with, many, human, diets, including, large, amounts, of, cooked, tubers, roots, or, legumes, other, food, production, and, processing, methods, including, animal, husbandry, and, industrial, refining, and, processing, have, further, changed, human, diets, humans, and, other, apes, occasionally, eat, other, primates, some, of, these, primates, are, now, close, to, extinction, with, habitat, loss, being, the, underlying, cause, all, the, non, human, hominoids, are, generally, thought, of, as, highly, intelligent, and, scientific, study, has, broadly, confirmed, that, they, perform, very, well, on, a, wide, range, of, cognitive, tests, though, there, is, relatively, little, data, on, gibbon, cognition, the, early, studies, by, wolfgang, k, hler, demonstrated, exceptional, problem, solving, abilities, in, chimpanzees, which, k, hler, attributed, to, insight, the, use, of, tools, has, been, repeatedly, demonstrated, more, recently, the, manufacture, of, tools, has, been, documented, both, in, the, wild, and, in, laboratory, tests, imitation, is, much, more, easily, demonstrated, in, great, apes, than, in, other, primate, species, almost, all, the, studies, in, animal, language, acquisition, have, been, done, with, great, apes, and, though, there, is, continuing, dispute, as, to, whether, they, demonstrate, real, language, abilities, there, is, no, doubt, that, they, involve, significant, feats, of, learning, chimpanzees, in, different, parts, of, africa, have, developed, tools, that, are, used, in, food, acquisition, demonstrating, a, form, of, animal, culture
