algae, uk, l, i, al, ghee, us, l, d, i, al, jee, sg, alga, l, al, g, are, any, of, a, large, and, diverse, group, of, photosynthetic, eukaryotic, organisms, the, name, is, an, informal, term, for, a, polyphyletic, grouping, that, includes, species, from, multiple, distinct, clades, included, organisms, range, from, unicellular, microalgae, such, as, chlorella, prototheca, and, the, diatoms, to, multicellular, forms, such, as, the, giant, kelp, a, large, brown, alga, which, may, grow, up, to, 50, metres, 160, ft, in, length, most, are, aquatic, and, lack, many, of, the, distinct, cell, and, tissue, types, such, as, stomata, xylem, and, phloem, that, are, found, in, land, plants, the, largest, and, most, complex, marine, algae, are, called, seaweeds, in, contrast, the, most, complex, freshwater, forms, are, the, charophyta, a, division, of, green, algae, which, includes, for, example, spirogyra, and, stoneworts, algae, that, are, carried, by, water, are, plankton, specifically, phytoplankton, algae, constitute, a, polyphyletic, group, since, they, do, not, include, a, common, ancestor, and, although, their, plastids, seem, to, have, a, single, origin, from, cyanobacteria, they, were, acquired, in, different, ways, green, algae, are, examples, of, algae, that, have, primary, chloroplasts, derived, from, endosymbiotic, cyanobacteria, diatoms, and, brown, algae, are, examples, of, algae, with, secondary, chloroplasts, derived, from, an, endosymbiotic, red, alga, algae, exhibit, a, wide, range, of, reproductive, strategies, from, simple, asexual, cell, division, to, complex, forms, of, sexual, reproduction, algae, lack, the, various, structures, that, characterize, land, plants, such, as, the, phyllids, leaf, like, structures, of, bryophytes, rhizoids, of, non, vascular, plants, and, the, roots, leaves, and, other, organs, found, in, tracheophytes, vascular, plants, most, are, phototrophic, although, some, are, mixotrophic, deriving, energy, both, from, photosynthesis, and, uptake, of, organic, carbon, either, by, osmotrophy, myzotrophy, or, phagotrophy, some, unicellular, species, of, green, algae, many, golden, algae, euglenids, dinoflagellates, and, other, algae, have, become, heterotrophs, also, called, colorless, or, apochlorotic, algae, sometimes, parasitic, relying, entirely, on, external, energy, sources, and, have, limited, or, no, photosynthetic, apparatus, some, other, heterotrophic, organisms, such, as, the, apicomplexans, are, also, derived, from, cells, whose, ancestors, possessed, plastids, but, are, not, traditionally, considered, as, algae, algae, have, photosynthetic, machinery, ultimately, derived, from, cyanobacteria, that, produce, oxygen, as, a, by, product, of, photosynthesis, unlike, other, photosynthetic, bacteria, such, as, purple, and, green, sulfur, bacteria, fossilized, filamentous, algae, from, the, vindhya, basin, have, been, dated, to, 1, 6, to, 1, 7, billion, years, ago, because, of, the, wide, range, of, algae, types, they, have, increasingly, different, industrial, and, traditional, applications, in, human, society, traditional, seaweed, farming, practices, have, existed, for, thousands, of, years, and, have, strong, traditions, in, east, asia, food, cultures, more, modern, algaculture, applications, extend, the, food, traditions, for, other, applications, including, cattle, feed, using, algae, for, bioremediation, or, pollution, control, transforming, sunlight, into, algae, fuels, or, other, chemicals, used, in, industrial, processes, and, in, medical, and, scientific, applications, a, 2020, review, found, that, these, applications, of, algae, could, play, an, important, role, in, carbon, sequestration, to, mitigate, climate, change, while, providing, lucrative, value, added, products, for, global, economies, the, singular, alga, is, the, latin, word, for, seaweed, and, retains, that, meaning, in, english, the, etymology, is, obscure, although, some, speculate, that, it, is, related, to, latin, alg, re, be, cold, no, reason, is, known, to, associate, seaweed, with, temperature, a, more, likely, source, is, alliga, binding, entwining, the, ancient, greek, word, for, seaweed, was, ph, kos, which, could, mean, either, the, seaweed, probably, red, algae, or, a, red, dye, derived, from, it, the, latinization, f, cus, meant, primarily, the, cosmetic, rouge, the, etymology, is, uncertain, but, a, strong, candidate, has, long, been, some, word, related, to, the, biblical, p, k, paint, if, not, that, word, itself, a, cosmetic, eye, shadow, used, by, the, ancient, egyptians, and, other, inhabitants, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, it, could, be, any, color, black, red, green, or, blue, the, study, of, algae, is, most, commonly, called, phycology, from, greek, phykos, seaweed, the, term, algology, is, falling, out, of, use, one, definition, of, algae, is, that, they, have, chlorophyll, as, their, primary, photosynthetic, pigment, and, lack, a, sterile, covering, of, cells, around, their, reproductive, cells, on, the, other, hand, the, colorless, prototheca, under, chlorophyta, are, all, devoid, of, any, chlorophyll, although, cyanobacteria, are, often, referred, to, as, blue, green, algae, most, authorities, exclude, all, prokaryotes, including, cyanobacteria, from, the, definition, of, algae, the, algae, contain, chloroplasts, that, are, similar, in, structure, to, cyanobacteria, chloroplasts, contain, circular, dna, like, that, in, cyanobacteria, and, are, interpreted, as, representing, reduced, endosymbiotic, cyanobacteria, however, the, exact, origin, of, the, chloroplasts, is, different, among, separate, lineages, of, algae, reflecting, their, acquisition, during, different, endosymbiotic, events, the, table, below, describes, the, composition, of, the, three, major, groups, of, algae, their, lineage, relationships, are, shown, in, the, figure, in, the, upper, right, many, of, these, groups, contain, some, members, that, are, no, longer, photosynthetic, some, retain, plastids, but, not, chloroplasts, while, others, have, lost, plastids, entirely, phylogeny, based, on, plastid, not, nucleocytoplasmic, genealogy, cyanobacteria, glaucophytes, rhodophytes, stramenopiles, cryptophytes, haptophytes, euglenophytes, chlorarachniophytes, chlorophytes, charophytes, land, plants, embryophyta, these, groups, have, green, chloroplasts, containing, chlorophylls, a, and, b, their, chloroplasts, are, surrounded, by, four, and, three, membranes, respectively, and, were, probably, retained, from, ingested, green, algae, chlorarachniophytes, which, belong, to, the, phylum, cercozoa, contain, a, small, nucleomorph, which, is, a, relict, of, the, algae, s, nucleus, euglenids, which, belong, to, the, phylum, euglenozoa, live, primarily, in, fresh, water, and, have, chloroplasts, with, only, three, membranes, the, endosymbiotic, green, algae, may, have, been, acquired, through, myzocytosis, rather, than, phagocytosis, another, group, with, green, algae, endosymbionts, is, the, dinoflagellate, genus, lepidodinium, which, has, replaced, its, original, endosymbiont, of, red, algal, origin, with, one, of, green, algal, origin, a, nucleomorph, is, present, and, the, host, genome, still, have, several, red, algal, genes, acquired, through, endosymbiotic, gene, transfer, also, the, euglenid, and, chlorarachniophyte, genome, contain, genes, of, apparent, red, algal, ancestry, these, groups, have, chloroplasts, containing, chlorophylls, a, and, c, and, phycobilins, the, shape, can, vary, they, may, be, of, discoid, plate, like, reticulate, cup, shaped, spiral, or, ribbon, shaped, they, have, one, or, more, pyrenoids, to, preserve, protein, and, starch, the, latter, chlorophyll, type, is, not, known, from, any, prokaryotes, or, primary, chloroplasts, but, genetic, similarities, with, red, algae, suggest, a, relationship, there, in, the, first, three, of, these, groups, chromista, the, chloroplast, has, four, membranes, retaining, a, nucleomorph, in, cryptomonads, and, they, likely, share, a, common, pigmented, ancestor, although, other, evidence, casts, doubt, on, whether, the, heterokonts, haptophyta, and, cryptomonads, are, in, fact, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, other, groups, the, typical, dinoflagellate, chloroplast, has, three, membranes, but, considerable, diversity, exists, in, chloroplasts, within, the, group, and, a, number, of, endosymbiotic, events, apparently, occurred, the, apicomplexa, a, group, of, closely, related, parasites, also, have, plastids, called, apicoplasts, which, are, not, photosynthetic, but, appear, to, have, a, common, origin, with, dinoflagellate, chloroplasts, linnaeus, in, species, plantarum, 1753, the, starting, point, for, modern, botanical, nomenclature, recognized, 14, genera, of, algae, of, which, only, four, are, currently, considered, among, algae, in, systema, naturae, linnaeus, described, the, genera, volvox, and, corallina, and, a, species, of, acetabularia, as, madrepora, among, the, animals, in, 1768, samuel, gottlieb, gmelin, 1744, 1774, published, the, historia, fucorum, the, first, work, dedicated, to, marine, algae, and, the, first, book, on, marine, biology, to, use, the, then, new, binomial, nomenclature, of, linnaeus, it, included, elaborate, illustrations, of, seaweed, and, marine, algae, on, folded, leaves, w, h, harvey, 1811, 1866, and, lamouroux, 1813, were, the, first, to, divide, macroscopic, algae, into, four, divisions, based, on, their, pigmentation, this, is, the, first, use, of, a, biochemical, criterion, in, plant, systematics, harvey, s, four, divisions, are, red, algae, rhodospermae, brown, algae, melanospermae, green, algae, chlorospermae, and, diatomaceae, at, this, time, microscopic, algae, were, discovered, and, reported, by, a, different, group, of, workers, e, g, o, f, m, ller, and, ehrenberg, studying, the, infusoria, microscopic, organisms, unlike, macroalgae, which, were, clearly, viewed, as, plants, microalgae, were, frequently, considered, animals, because, they, are, often, motile, even, the, nonmotile, coccoid, microalgae, were, sometimes, merely, seen, as, stages, of, the, lifecycle, of, plants, macroalgae, or, animals, although, used, as, a, taxonomic, category, in, some, pre, darwinian, classifications, e, g, linnaeus, 1753, de, jussieu, 1789, lamouroux, 1813, harvey, 1836, horaninow, 1843, agassiz, 1859, wilson, cassin, 1864, in, further, classifications, the, algae, are, seen, as, an, artificial, polyphyletic, group, throughout, the, 20th, century, most, classifications, treated, the, following, groups, as, divisions, or, classes, of, algae, cyanophytes, rhodophytes, chrysophytes, xanthophytes, bacillariophytes, phaeophytes, pyrrhophytes, cryptophytes, and, dinophytes, euglenophytes, and, chlorophytes, later, many, new, groups, were, discovered, e, g, bolidophyceae, and, others, were, splintered, from, older, groups, charophytes, and, glaucophytes, from, chlorophytes, many, heterokontophytes, e, g, synurophytes, from, chrysophytes, or, eustigmatophytes, from, xanthophytes, haptophytes, from, chrysophytes, and, chlorarachniophytes, from, xanthophytes, with, the, abandonment, of, plant, animal, dichotomous, classification, most, groups, of, algae, sometimes, all, were, included, in, protista, later, also, abandoned, in, favour, of, eukaryota, however, as, a, legacy, of, the, older, plant, life, scheme, some, groups, that, were, also, treated, as, protozoans, in, the, past, still, have, duplicated, classifications, see, ambiregnal, protists, some, parasitic, algae, e, g, the, green, algae, prototheca, and, helicosporidium, parasites, of, metazoans, or, cephaleuros, parasites, of, plants, were, originally, classified, as, fungi, sporozoans, or, protistans, of, incertae, sedis, while, others, e, g, the, green, algae, phyllosiphon, and, rhodochytrium, parasites, of, plants, or, the, red, algae, pterocladiophila, and, gelidiocolax, mammillatus, parasites, of, other, red, algae, or, the, dinoflagellates, oodinium, parasites, of, fish, had, their, relationship, with, algae, conjectured, early, in, other, cases, some, groups, were, originally, characterized, as, parasitic, algae, e, g, chlorochytrium, but, later, were, seen, as, endophytic, algae, some, filamentous, bacteria, e, g, beggiatoa, were, originally, seen, as, algae, furthermore, groups, like, the, apicomplexans, are, also, parasites, derived, from, ancestors, that, possessed, plastids, but, are, not, included, in, any, group, traditionally, seen, as, algae, algae, are, polyphyletic, thus, their, origin, cannot, be, traced, back, to, single, hypothetical, common, ancestor, it, is, thought, that, they, came, into, existence, when, photosynthetic, coccoid, cyanobacteria, got, phagocytized, by, a, unicellular, heterotrophic, eukaryote, a, protist, giving, rise, to, double, membranous, primary, plastids, such, symbiogenic, events, primary, symbiogenesis, are, believed, to, have, occurred, more, than, 1, 5, billion, years, ago, during, the, calymmian, period, early, in, boring, billion, but, it, is, difficult, to, track, the, key, events, because, of, so, much, time, gap, primary, symbiogenesis, gave, rise, to, three, divisions, of, archaeplastids, namely, the, viridiplantae, green, algae, and, later, plants, rhodophyta, red, algae, and, glaucophyta, grey, algae, whose, plastids, further, spread, into, other, protist, lineages, through, eukaryote, eukaryote, predation, engulfments, and, subsequent, endosymbioses, secondary, and, tertiary, symbiogenesis, this, process, of, serial, cell, capture, and, enslavement, explains, the, diversity, of, photosynthetic, eukaryotes, recent, genomic, and, phylogenomic, approaches, have, significantly, clarified, plastid, genome, evolution, the, horizontal, movement, of, endosymbiont, genes, to, the, host, nuclear, genome, and, plastid, spread, throughout, the, eukaryotic, tree, of, life, fossils, of, isolated, spores, suggest, land, plants, may, have, been, around, as, long, as, 475, million, years, ago, mya, during, the, late, cambrian, early, ordovician, period, from, sessile, shallow, freshwater, charophyte, algae, much, like, chara, which, likely, got, stranded, ashore, when, riverine, lacustrine, water, levels, dropped, during, dry, seasons, these, charophyte, algae, probably, already, developed, filamentous, thalli, and, holdfasts, that, superficially, resembled, plant, stems, and, roots, and, probably, had, an, isomorphic, alternation, of, generations, they, perhaps, evolved, some, 850, mya, and, might, even, be, as, early, as, 1, gya, during, the, late, phase, of, the, boring, billion, a, range, of, algal, morphologies, is, exhibited, and, convergence, of, features, in, unrelated, groups, is, common, the, only, groups, to, exhibit, three, dimensional, multicellular, thalli, are, the, reds, and, browns, and, some, chlorophytes, apical, growth, is, constrained, to, subsets, of, these, groups, the, florideophyte, reds, various, browns, and, the, charophytes, the, form, of, charophytes, is, quite, different, from, those, of, reds, and, browns, because, they, have, distinct, nodes, separated, by, internode, stems, whorls, of, branches, reminiscent, of, the, horsetails, occur, at, the, nodes, conceptacles, are, another, polyphyletic, trait, they, appear, in, the, coralline, algae, and, the, hildenbrandiales, as, well, as, the, browns, most, of, the, simpler, algae, are, unicellular, flagellates, or, amoeboids, but, colonial, and, nonmotile, forms, have, developed, independently, among, several, of, the, groups, some, of, the, more, common, organizational, levels, more, than, one, of, which, may, occur, in, the, lifecycle, of, a, species, are, in, three, lines, even, higher, levels, of, organization, have, been, reached, with, full, tissue, differentiation, these, are, the, brown, algae, some, of, which, may, reach, 50, m, in, length, kelps, the, red, algae, and, the, green, algae, the, most, complex, forms, are, found, among, the, charophyte, algae, see, charales, and, charophyta, in, a, lineage, that, eventually, led, to, the, higher, land, plants, the, innovation, that, defines, these, nonalgal, plants, is, the, presence, of, female, reproductive, organs, with, protective, cell, layers, that, protect, the, zygote, and, developing, embryo, hence, the, land, plants, are, referred, to, as, the, embryophytes, the, term, algal, turf, is, commonly, used, but, poorly, defined, algal, turfs, are, thick, carpet, like, beds, of, seaweed, that, retain, sediment, and, compete, with, foundation, species, like, corals, and, kelps, and, they, are, usually, less, than, 15, cm, tall, such, a, turf, may, consist, of, one, or, more, species, and, will, generally, cover, an, area, in, the, order, of, a, square, metre, or, more, some, common, characteristics, are, listed, many, algae, particularly, species, of, the, characeae, have, served, as, model, experimental, organisms, to, understand, the, mechanisms, of, the, water, permeability, of, membranes, osmoregulation, turgor, regulation, salt, tolerance, cytoplasmic, streaming, and, the, generation, of, action, potentials, phytohormones, are, found, not, only, in, higher, plants, but, in, algae, too, some, species, of, algae, form, symbiotic, relationships, with, other, organisms, in, these, symbioses, the, algae, supply, photosynthates, organic, substances, to, the, host, organism, providing, protection, to, the, algal, cells, the, host, organism, derives, some, or, all, of, its, energy, requirements, from, the, algae, examples, are, lichens, are, defined, by, the, international, association, for, lichenology, to, be, an, association, of, a, fungus, and, a, photosynthetic, symbiont, resulting, in, a, stable, vegetative, body, having, a, specific, structure, the, fungi, or, mycobionts, are, mainly, from, the, ascomycota, with, a, few, from, the, basidiomycota, in, nature, they, do, not, occur, separate, from, lichens, it, is, unknown, when, they, began, to, associate, one, mycobiont, associates, with, the, same, phycobiont, species, rarely, two, from, the, green, algae, except, that, alternatively, the, mycobiont, may, associate, with, a, species, of, cyanobacteria, hence, photobiont, is, the, more, accurate, term, a, photobiont, may, be, associated, with, many, different, mycobionts, or, may, live, independently, accordingly, lichens, are, named, and, classified, as, fungal, species, the, association, is, termed, a, morphogenesis, because, the, lichen, has, a, form, and, capabilities, not, possessed, by, the, symbiont, species, alone, they, can, be, experimentally, isolated, the, photobiont, possibly, triggers, otherwise, latent, genes, in, the, mycobiont, trentepohlia, is, an, example, of, a, common, green, alga, genus, worldwide, that, can, grow, on, its, own, or, be, lichenised, lichen, thus, share, some, of, the, habitat, and, often, similar, appearance, with, specialized, species, of, algae, aerophytes, growing, on, exposed, surfaces, such, as, tree, trunks, and, rocks, and, sometimes, discoloring, them, coral, reefs, are, accumulated, from, the, calcareous, exoskeletons, of, marine, invertebrates, of, the, order, scleractinia, stony, corals, these, animals, metabolize, sugar, and, oxygen, to, obtain, energy, for, their, cell, building, processes, including, secretion, of, the, exoskeleton, with, water, and, carbon, dioxide, as, byproducts, dinoflagellates, algal, protists, are, often, endosymbionts, in, the, cells, of, the, coral, forming, marine, invertebrates, where, they, accelerate, host, cell, metabolism, by, generating, sugar, and, oxygen, immediately, available, through, photosynthesis, using, incident, light, and, the, carbon, dioxide, produced, by, the, host, reef, building, stony, corals, hermatypic, corals, require, endosymbiotic, algae, from, the, genus, symbiodinium, to, be, in, a, healthy, condition, the, loss, of, symbiodinium, from, the, host, is, known, as, coral, bleaching, a, condition, which, leads, to, the, deterioration, of, a, reef, endosymbiontic, green, algae, live, close, to, the, surface, of, some, sponges, for, example, breadcrumb, sponges, halichondria, panicea, the, alga, is, thus, protected, from, predators, the, sponge, is, provided, with, oxygen, and, sugars, which, can, account, for, 50, to, 80, of, sponge, growth, in, some, species, rhodophyta, chlorophyta, and, heterokontophyta, the, three, main, algal, divisions, have, life, cycles, which, show, considerable, variation, and, complexity, in, general, an, asexual, phase, exists, where, the, seaweed, s, cells, are, diploid, a, sexual, phase, where, the, cells, are, haploid, followed, by, fusion, of, the, male, and, female, gametes, asexual, reproduction, permits, efficient, population, increases, but, less, variation, is, possible, commonly, in, sexual, reproduction, of, unicellular, and, colonial, algae, two, specialized, sexually, compatible, haploid, gametes, make, physical, contact, and, fuse, to, form, a, zygote, to, ensure, a, successful, mating, the, development, and, release, of, gametes, is, highly, synchronized, and, regulated, pheromones, may, play, a, key, role, in, these, processes, sexual, reproduction, allows, for, more, variation, and, provides, the, benefit, of, efficient, recombinational, repair, of, dna, damages, during, meiosis, a, key, stage, of, the, sexual, cycle, however, sexual, reproduction, is, more, costly, than, asexual, reproduction, meiosis, has, been, shown, to, occur, in, many, different, species, of, algae, the, algal, collection, of, the, us, national, herbarium, located, in, the, national, museum, of, natural, history, consists, of, approximately, 320, 500, dried, specimens, which, although, not, exhaustive, no, exhaustive, collection, exists, gives, an, idea, of, the, order, of, magnitude, of, the, number, of, algal, species, that, number, remains, unknown, estimates, vary, widely, for, example, according, to, one, standard, textbook, in, the, british, isles, the, uk, biodiversity, steering, group, report, estimated, there, to, be, 20, 000, algal, species, in, the, uk, another, checklist, reports, only, about, 5, 000, species, regarding, the, difference, of, about, 15, 000, species, the, text, concludes, it, will, require, many, detailed, field, surveys, before, it, is, possible, to, provide, a, reliable, estimate, of, the, total, number, of, species, regional, and, group, estimates, have, been, made, as, well, and, so, on, but, lacking, any, scientific, basis, or, reliable, sources, these, numbers, have, no, more, credibility, than, the, british, ones, mentioned, above, most, estimates, also, omit, microscopic, algae, such, as, phytoplankton, the, most, recent, estimate, suggests, 72, 500, algal, species, worldwide, the, distribution, of, algal, species, has, been, fairly, well, studied, since, the, founding, of, phytogeography, in, the, mid, 19th, century, algae, spread, mainly, by, the, dispersal, of, spores, analogously, to, the, dispersal, of, cryptogamic, plants, by, spores, spores, can, be, found, in, a, variety, of, environments, fresh, and, marine, waters, air, soil, and, in, or, on, other, organisms, whether, a, spore, is, to, grow, into, an, adult, organism, depends, on, the, species, and, the, environmental, conditions, where, the, spore, lands, the, spores, of, freshwater, algae, are, dispersed, mainly, by, running, water, and, wind, as, well, as, by, living, carriers, however, not, all, bodies, of, water, can, carry, all, species, of, algae, as, the, chemical, composition, of, certain, water, bodies, limits, the, algae, that, can, survive, within, them, marine, spores, are, often, spread, by, ocean, currents, ocean, water, presents, many, vastly, different, habitats, based, on, temperature, and, nutrient, availability, resulting, in, phytogeographic, zones, regions, and, provinces, to, some, degree, the, distribution, of, algae, is, subject, to, floristic, discontinuities, caused, by, geographical, features, such, as, antarctica, long, distances, of, ocean, or, general, land, masses, it, is, therefore, possible, to, identify, species, occurring, by, locality, such, as, pacific, algae, or, north, sea, algae, when, they, occur, out, of, their, localities, hypothesizing, a, transport, mechanism, is, usually, possible, such, as, the, hulls, of, ships, for, example, ulva, reticulata, and, u, fasciata, travelled, from, the, mainland, to, hawaii, in, this, manner, mapping, is, possible, for, select, species, only, there, are, many, valid, examples, of, confined, distribution, patterns, for, example, clathromorphum, is, an, arctic, genus, and, is, not, mapped, far, south, of, there, however, scientists, regard, the, overall, data, as, insufficient, due, to, the, difficulties, of, undertaking, such, studies, algae, are, prominent, in, bodies, of, water, common, in, terrestrial, environments, and, are, found, in, unusual, environments, such, as, on, snow, and, ice, seaweeds, grow, mostly, in, shallow, marine, waters, under, 100, m, 330, ft, deep, however, some, such, as, navicula, pennata, have, been, recorded, to, a, depth, of, 360, m, 1, 180, ft, a, type, of, algae, ancylonema, nordenskioeldii, was, found, in, greenland, in, areas, known, as, the, dark, zone, which, caused, an, increase, in, the, rate, of, melting, ice, sheet, same, algae, was, found, in, the, italian, alps, after, pink, ice, appeared, on, parts, of, the, presena, glacier, the, various, sorts, of, algae, play, significant, roles, in, aquatic, ecology, microscopic, forms, that, live, suspended, in, the, water, column, phytoplankton, provide, the, food, base, for, most, marine, food, chains, in, very, high, densities, algal, blooms, these, algae, may, discolor, the, water, and, outcompete, poison, or, asphyxiate, other, life, forms, algae, can, be, used, as, indicator, organisms, to, monitor, pollution, in, various, aquatic, systems, in, many, cases, algal, metabolism, is, sensitive, to, various, pollutants, due, to, this, the, species, composition, of, algal, populations, may, shift, in, the, presence, of, chemical, pollutants, to, detect, these, changes, algae, can, be, sampled, from, the, environment, and, maintained, in, laboratories, with, relative, ease, on, the, basis, of, their, habitat, algae, can, be, categorized, as, aquatic, planktonic, benthic, marine, freshwater, lentic, lotic, terrestrial, aerial, subaerial, lithophytic, halophytic, or, euryhaline, psammon, thermophilic, cryophilic, epibiont, epiphytic, epizoic, endosymbiont, endophytic, endozoic, parasitic, calcifilic, or, lichenic, phycobiont, in, classical, chinese, the, word, is, used, both, for, algae, and, in, the, modest, tradition, of, the, imperial, scholars, for, literary, talent, the, third, island, in, kunming, lake, beside, the, summer, palace, in, beijing, is, known, as, the, zaojian, tang, dao, which, thus, simultaneously, means, island, of, the, algae, viewing, hall, and, island, of, the, hall, for, reflecting, on, literary, talent, algaculture, is, a, form, of, aquaculture, involving, the, farming, of, species, of, algae, the, majority, of, algae, that, are, intentionally, cultivated, fall, into, the, category, of, microalgae, also, referred, to, as, phytoplankton, microphytes, or, planktonic, algae, macroalgae, commonly, known, as, seaweed, also, have, many, commercial, and, industrial, uses, but, due, to, their, size, and, the, specific, requirements, of, the, environment, in, which, they, need, to, grow, they, do, not, lend, themselves, as, readily, to, cultivation, this, may, change, however, with, the, advent, of, newer, seaweed, cultivators, which, are, basically, algae, scrubbers, using, upflowing, air, bubbles, in, small, containers, commercial, and, industrial, algae, cultivation, has, numerous, uses, including, production, of, nutraceuticals, such, as, omega, 3, fatty, acids, as, algal, oil, or, natural, food, colorants, and, dyes, food, fertilizers, bioplastics, chemical, feedstock, raw, material, protein, rich, animal, aquaculture, feed, pharmaceuticals, and, algal, fuel, and, can, also, be, used, as, a, means, of, pollution, control, and, natural, carbon, sequestration, seaweed, farming, or, kelp, farming, is, the, practice, of, cultivating, and, harvesting, seaweed, in, its, simplest, form, farmers, gather, from, natural, beds, while, at, the, other, extreme, farmers, fully, control, the, crop, s, life, cycle, the, seven, most, cultivated, taxa, are, eucheuma, spp, kappaphycus, alvarezii, gracilaria, spp, saccharina, japonica, undaria, pinnatifida, pyropia, spp, and, sargassum, fusiforme, eucheuma, and, k, alvarezii, are, attractive, for, carrageenan, a, gelling, agent, gracilaria, is, farmed, for, agar, the, rest, are, eaten, after, limited, processing, seaweeds, are, different, from, mangroves, and, seagrasses, as, they, are, photosynthetic, algal, organisms, and, are, non, flowering, the, largest, seaweed, producing, countries, as, of, 2022, are, china, 58, 62, and, indonesia, 28, 6, followed, by, south, korea, 5, 09, and, the, philippines, 4, 19, other, notable, producers, include, north, korea, 1, 6, japan, 1, 15, malaysia, 0, 53, zanzibar, tanzania, 0, 5, and, chile, 0, 3, seaweed, farming, has, frequently, been, developed, to, improve, economic, conditions, and, to, reduce, fishing, pressure, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, reported, that, world, production, in, 2019, was, over, 35, million, tonnes, north, america, produced, some, 23, 000, tonnes, of, wet, seaweed, alaska, maine, france, and, norway, each, more, than, doubled, their, seaweed, production, since, 2018, as, of, 2019, seaweed, represented, 30, of, marine, aquaculture, an, algae, bioreactor, is, used, for, cultivating, micro, or, macroalgae, algae, may, be, cultivated, for, the, purposes, of, biomass, production, as, in, a, seaweed, cultivator, wastewater, treatment, co, 2, fixation, or, aquarium, pond, filtration, in, the, form, of, an, algae, scrubber, algae, bioreactors, vary, widely, in, design, falling, broadly, into, two, categories, open, reactors, and, enclosed, reactors, open, reactors, are, exposed, to, the, atmosphere, while, enclosed, reactors, also, commonly, called, photobioreactors, are, isolated, to, varying, extents, from, the, atmosphere, specifically, algae, bioreactors, can, be, used, to, produce, fuels, such, as, biodiesel, and, bioethanol, to, generate, animal, feed, or, to, reduce, pollutants, such, as, no, x, and, co, 2, in, flue, agar, a, gelatinous, substance, derived, from, red, algae, has, a, number, of, commercial, uses, it, is, a, good, medium, on, which, to, grow, bacteria, and, fungi, as, most, microorganisms, cannot, digest, agar, alginic, acid, or, alginate, is, extracted, from, brown, algae, its, uses, range, from, gelling, agents, in, food, to, medical, dressings, alginic, acid, also, has, been, used, in, the, field, of, biotechnology, as, a, biocompatible, medium, for, cell, encapsulation, and, cell, immobilization, molecular, cuisine, is, also, a, user, of, the, substance, for, its, gelling, properties, by, which, it, becomes, a, delivery, vehicle, for, flavours, between, 100, 000, and, 170, 000, wet, tons, of, macrocystis, are, harvested, annually, in, new, mexico, for, alginate, extraction, and, abalone, feed, to, be, competitive, and, independent, from, fluctuating, support, from, local, policy, on, the, long, run, biofuels, should, equal, or, beat, the, cost, level, of, fossil, fuels, here, algae, based, fuels, hold, great, promise, directly, related, to, the, potential, to, produce, more, biomass, per, unit, area, in, a, year, than, any, other, form, of, biomass, the, break, even, point, for, algae, based, biofuels, is, estimated, to, occur, by, 2025, for, centuries, seaweed, has, been, used, as, a, fertilizer, george, owen, of, henllys, writing, in, the, 16th, century, referring, to, drift, weed, in, south, wales, this, kind, of, ore, they, often, gather, and, lay, on, great, heapes, where, it, heteth, and, rotteth, and, will, have, a, strong, and, loathsome, smell, when, being, so, rotten, they, cast, on, the, land, as, they, do, their, muck, and, thereof, springeth, good, corn, especially, barley, after, spring, tydes, or, great, rigs, of, the, sea, they, fetch, it, in, sacks, on, horse, backes, and, carie, the, same, three, four, or, five, miles, and, cast, it, on, the, lande, which, doth, very, much, better, the, ground, for, corn, and, grass, today, algae, are, used, by, humans, in, many, ways, for, example, as, fertilizers, soil, conditioners, and, livestock, feed, aquatic, and, microscopic, species, are, cultured, in, clear, tanks, or, ponds, and, are, either, harvested, or, used, to, treat, effluents, pumped, through, the, ponds, algaculture, on, a, large, scale, is, an, important, type, of, aquaculture, in, some, places, maerl, is, commonly, used, as, a, soil, conditioner, naturally, growing, seaweeds, are, an, important, source, of, food, especially, in, asia, leading, some, to, label, them, as, superfoods, they, provide, many, vitamins, including, a, b, 1, b, 2, b, 6, niacin, and, c, and, are, rich, in, iodine, potassium, iron, magnesium, and, calcium, in, addition, commercially, cultivated, microalgae, including, both, algae, and, cyanobacteria, are, marketed, as, nutritional, supplements, such, as, spirulina, chlorella, and, the, vitamin, c, supplement, from, dunaliella, high, in, beta, carotene, algae, are, national, foods, of, many, nations, china, consumes, more, than, 70, species, including, fat, choy, a, cyanobacterium, considered, a, vegetable, japan, over, 20, species, such, as, nori, and, aonori, ireland, dulse, chile, cochayuyo, laver, is, used, to, make, laverbread, in, wales, where, it, is, known, as, bara, lawr, in, korea, green, laver, is, used, to, make, gim, it, is, also, used, along, the, west, coast, of, north, america, from, california, to, british, columbia, in, hawaii, and, by, the, m, ori, of, new, zealand, sea, lettuce, and, badderlocks, are, salad, ingredients, in, scotland, ireland, greenland, and, iceland, algae, is, being, considered, a, potential, solution, for, world, hunger, problem, two, popular, forms, of, algae, are, used, in, cuisine, furthermore, it, contains, all, nine, of, the, essential, amino, acids, the, body, does, not, produce, on, its, own, the, oils, from, some, algae, have, high, levels, of, unsaturated, fatty, acids, for, example, parietochloris, incisa, is, high, in, arachidonic, acid, where, it, reaches, up, to, 47, of, the, triglyceride, pool, some, varieties, of, algae, favored, by, vegetarianism, and, veganism, contain, the, long, chain, essential, omega, 3, fatty, acids, docosahexaenoic, acid, dha, and, eicosapentaenoic, acid, epa, fish, oil, contains, the, omega, 3, fatty, acids, but, the, original, source, is, algae, microalgae, in, particular, which, are, eaten, by, marine, life, such, as, copepods, and, are, passed, up, the, food, chain, algae, have, emerged, in, recent, years, as, a, popular, source, of, omega, 3, fatty, acids, for, vegetarians, who, cannot, get, long, chain, epa, and, dha, from, other, vegetarian, sources, such, as, flaxseed, oil, which, only, contains, the, short, chain, alpha, linolenic, acid, ala, agricultural, research, service, scientists, found, that, 60, 90, of, nitrogen, runoff, and, 70, 100, of, phosphorus, runoff, can, be, captured, from, manure, effluents, using, a, horizontal, algae, scrubber, also, called, an, algal, turf, scrubber, ats, scientists, developed, the, ats, which, consists, of, shallow, 100, foot, raceways, of, nylon, netting, where, algae, colonies, can, form, and, studied, its, efficacy, for, three, years, they, found, that, algae, can, readily, be, used, to, reduce, the, nutrient, runoff, from, agricultural, fields, and, increase, the, quality, of, water, flowing, into, rivers, streams, and, oceans, researchers, collected, and, dried, the, nutrient, rich, algae, from, the, ats, and, studied, its, potential, as, an, organic, fertilizer, they, found, that, cucumber, and, corn, seedlings, grew, just, as, well, using, ats, organic, fertilizer, as, they, did, with, commercial, fertilizers, algae, scrubbers, using, bubbling, upflow, or, vertical, waterfall, versions, are, now, also, being, used, to, filter, aquaria, and, ponds, various, polymers, can, be, created, from, algae, which, can, be, especially, useful, in, the, creation, of, bioplastics, these, include, hybrid, plastics, cellulose, based, plastics, poly, lactic, acid, and, bio, polyethylene, several, companies, have, begun, to, produce, algae, polymers, commercially, including, for, use, in, flip, flops, and, in, surf, boards, the, alga, stichococcus, bacillaris, has, been, seen, to, colonize, silicone, resins, used, at, archaeological, sites, biodegrading, the, synthetic, substance, the, natural, pigments, carotenoids, and, chlorophylls, produced, by, algae, can, be, used, as, alternatives, to, chemical, dyes, and, coloring, agents, the, presence, of, some, individual, algal, pigments, together, with, specific, pigment, concentration, ratios, are, taxon, specific, analysis, of, their, concentrations, with, various, analytical, methods, particularly, high, performance, liquid, chromatography, can, therefore, offer, deep, insight, into, the, taxonomic, composition, and, relative, abundance, of, natural, algae, populations, in, sea, water, samples, carrageenan, from, the, red, alga, chondrus, crispus, is, used, as, a, stabilizer, in, milk, products
