poliomyelitis, p, o, l, i, o, m, a, l, a, t, s, poh, lee, oh, my, ly, tiss, commonly, shortened, to, polio, is, an, infectious, disease, caused, by, the, poliovirus, approximately, 75, of, cases, are, asymptomatic, mild, symptoms, which, can, occur, include, sore, throat, and, fever, in, a, proportion, of, cases, more, severe, symptoms, develop, such, as, headache, neck, stiffness, and, paresthesia, these, symptoms, usually, pass, within, one, or, two, weeks, a, less, common, symptom, is, permanent, paralysis, and, possible, death, in, extreme, cases, years, after, recovery, post, polio, syndrome, may, occur, with, a, slow, development, of, muscle, weakness, similar, to, what, the, person, had, during, the, initial, infection, polio, occurs, naturally, only, in, humans, it, is, highly, infectious, and, is, spread, from, person, to, person, either, through, fecal, oral, transmission, e, g, poor, hygiene, or, by, ingestion, of, food, or, water, contaminated, by, human, feces, or, via, the, oral, oral, route, those, who, are, infected, may, spread, the, disease, for, up, to, six, weeks, even, if, no, symptoms, are, present, the, disease, may, be, diagnosed, by, finding, the, virus, in, the, feces, or, detecting, antibodies, against, it, in, the, blood, poliomyelitis, has, existed, for, thousands, of, years, with, depictions, of, the, disease, in, ancient, art, the, disease, was, first, recognized, as, a, distinct, condition, by, the, english, physician, michael, underwood, in, 1789, and, the, virus, that, causes, it, was, first, identified, in, 1909, by, the, austrian, immunologist, karl, landsteiner, major, outbreaks, started, to, occur, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, europe, and, the, united, states, and, in, the, 20th, century, it, became, one, of, the, most, worrying, childhood, diseases, following, the, introduction, of, polio, vaccines, in, the, 1950s, polio, incidence, declined, rapidly, as, of, october, 2023, only, pakistan, and, afghanistan, remain, endemic, for, wild, poliovirus, wpv, once, infected, there, is, no, specific, treatment, the, disease, can, be, prevented, by, the, polio, vaccine, with, multiple, doses, required, for, lifelong, protection, there, are, two, broad, types, of, polio, vaccine, an, injected, polio, vaccine, ipv, using, inactivated, poliovirus, and, an, oral, polio, vaccine, opv, containing, attenuated, weakened, live, virus, through, the, use, of, both, types, of, vaccine, incidence, of, wild, polio, has, decreased, from, an, estimated, 350, 000, cases, in, 1988, to, 30, confirmed, cases, in, 2022, confined, to, just, three, countries, in, rare, cases, the, traditional, opv, was, able, to, revert, to, a, virulent, form, an, improved, oral, vaccine, with, greater, genetic, stability, nopv2, was, developed, and, granted, full, licensure, in, december, 2023, the, term, poliomyelitis, is, used, to, identify, the, disease, caused, by, any, of, the, three, serotypes, of, poliovirus, two, basic, patterns, of, polio, infection, are, described, a, minor, illness, that, does, not, involve, the, central, nervous, system, cns, sometimes, called, abortive, poliomyelitis, and, a, major, illness, involving, the, cns, which, may, be, paralytic, or, nonparalytic, adults, are, more, likely, to, develop, symptoms, including, severe, symptoms, than, children, in, most, people, with, a, normal, immune, system, a, poliovirus, infection, is, asymptomatic, in, about, 25, of, cases, the, infection, produces, minor, symptoms, which, may, include, sore, throat, and, low, fever, these, symptoms, are, temporary, and, full, recovery, occurs, within, one, or, two, weeks, in, about, 1, percent, of, infections, the, virus, can, migrate, from, the, gastrointestinal, tract, into, the, central, nervous, system, cns, most, patients, with, cns, involvement, develop, nonparalytic, aseptic, meningitis, with, symptoms, of, headache, neck, back, abdominal, and, extremity, pain, fever, vomiting, stomach, pain, lethargy, and, irritability, about, one, to, five, in, 1, 000, cases, progress, to, paralytic, disease, in, which, the, muscles, become, weak, floppy, and, poorly, controlled, and, finally, completely, paralyzed, this, condition, is, known, as, acute, flaccid, paralysis, the, weakness, most, often, involves, the, legs, but, may, less, commonly, involve, the, muscles, of, the, head, neck, and, diaphragm, depending, on, the, site, of, paralysis, paralytic, poliomyelitis, is, classified, as, spinal, bulbar, or, bulbospinal, in, those, who, develop, paralysis, between, 2, and, 10, percent, die, as, the, paralysis, affects, the, breathing, muscles, encephalitis, an, infection, of, the, brain, tissue, itself, can, occur, in, rare, cases, and, is, usually, restricted, to, infants, it, is, characterized, by, confusion, changes, in, mental, status, headaches, fever, and, less, commonly, seizures, and, spastic, paralysis, the, term, poliomyelitis, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, poli, s, meaning, grey, myel, s, marrow, referring, to, the, grey, matter, of, the, spinal, cord, and, the, suffix, itis, which, denotes, inflammation, i, e, inflammation, of, the, spinal, cord, s, grey, matter, the, word, was, first, used, in, 1874, and, is, attributed, to, the, german, physician, adolf, kussmaul, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, abbreviated, version, polio, was, in, the, indianapolis, star, in, 1911, poliomyelitis, does, not, affect, any, species, other, than, humans, the, disease, is, caused, by, infection, with, a, member, of, the, genus, enterovirus, known, as, poliovirus, pv, this, group, of, rna, viruses, colonize, the, gastrointestinal, tract, specifically, the, oropharynx, and, the, intestine, its, structure, is, quite, simple, composed, of, a, single, sense, rna, genome, enclosed, in, a, protein, shell, called, a, capsid, in, addition, to, protecting, the, virus, genetic, material, the, capsid, proteins, enable, poliovirus, to, infect, certain, types, of, cells, three, serotypes, of, poliovirus, have, been, identified, wild, poliovirus, type, 1, wpv1, type, 2, wpv2, and, type, 3, wpv3, each, with, a, slightly, different, capsid, protein, all, three, are, extremely, virulent, and, produce, the, same, disease, symptoms, wpv1, is, the, most, commonly, encountered, form, and, the, one, most, closely, associated, with, paralysis, wpv2, was, certified, as, eradicated, in, 2015, and, wpv3, certified, as, eradicated, in, 2019, the, incubation, period, from, exposure, to, the, first, signs, and, symptoms, ranges, from, three, to, six, days, for, nonparalytic, polio, if, the, disease, progresses, to, cause, paralysis, this, occurs, within, 7, to, 21, days, individuals, who, are, exposed, to, the, virus, either, through, infection, or, by, immunization, via, polio, vaccine, develop, immunity, in, immune, individuals, iga, antibodies, against, poliovirus, are, present, in, the, tonsils, and, gastrointestinal, tract, and, able, to, block, virus, replication, igg, and, igm, antibodies, against, pv, can, prevent, the, spread, of, the, virus, to, motor, neurons, of, the, central, nervous, system, infection, or, vaccination, with, one, serotype, of, poliovirus, does, not, provide, immunity, against, the, other, serotypes, and, full, immunity, requires, exposure, to, each, serotype, a, rare, condition, with, a, similar, presentation, nonpoliovirus, poliomyelitis, may, result, from, infections, with, enteroviruses, other, than, poliovirus, the, oral, polio, vaccine, which, has, been, in, use, since, 1961, contains, weakened, viruses, that, can, replicate, on, rare, occasions, these, may, be, transmitted, from, the, vaccinated, person, to, other, people, in, communities, with, good, vaccine, coverage, transmission, is, limited, and, the, virus, dies, out, in, communities, with, low, vaccine, coverage, this, weakened, virus, may, continue, to, circulate, and, over, time, may, mutate, and, revert, to, a, virulent, form, polio, arising, from, this, cause, is, referred, to, as, circulating, vaccine, derived, poliovirus, cvdpv, or, variant, poliovirus, in, order, to, distinguish, it, from, the, natural, or, wild, poliovirus, wpv, poliomyelitis, is, highly, contagious, the, disease, is, transmitted, primarily, via, the, fecal, oral, route, by, ingesting, contaminated, food, or, water, it, is, occasionally, transmitted, via, the, oral, oral, route, it, is, seasonal, in, temperate, climates, with, peak, transmission, occurring, in, summer, and, autumn, these, seasonal, differences, are, far, less, pronounced, in, tropical, areas, polio, is, most, infectious, between, 7, and, 10, days, before, and, after, the, appearance, of, symptoms, but, transmission, is, possible, as, long, as, the, virus, remains, in, the, saliva, or, feces, virus, particles, can, be, excreted, in, the, feces, for, up, to, six, weeks, factors, that, increase, the, risk, of, polio, infection, include, pregnancy, the, very, old, and, the, very, young, immune, deficiency, and, malnutrition, although, the, virus, can, cross, the, maternal, fetal, barrier, during, pregnancy, the, fetus, does, not, appear, to, be, affected, by, either, maternal, infection, or, polio, vaccination, maternal, antibodies, also, cross, the, placenta, providing, passive, immunity, that, protects, the, infant, from, polio, infection, during, the, first, few, months, of, life, poliovirus, enters, the, body, through, the, mouth, infecting, the, first, cells, with, which, it, comes, in, contact, the, pharynx, and, intestinal, mucosa, it, gains, entry, by, binding, to, an, immunoglobulin, like, receptor, known, as, the, poliovirus, receptor, or, cd155, on, the, cell, membrane, the, virus, then, hijacks, the, host, cell, s, own, machinery, and, begins, to, replicate, poliovirus, divides, within, gastrointestinal, cells, for, about, a, week, from, where, it, spreads, to, the, tonsils, specifically, the, follicular, dendritic, cells, residing, within, the, tonsilar, germinal, centers, the, intestinal, lymphoid, tissue, including, the, m, cells, of, peyer, s, patches, and, the, deep, cervical, and, mesenteric, lymph, nodes, where, it, multiplies, abundantly, the, virus, is, subsequently, absorbed, into, the, bloodstream, known, as, viremia, the, presence, of, a, virus, in, the, bloodstream, enables, it, to, be, widely, distributed, throughout, the, body, poliovirus, can, survive, and, multiply, within, the, blood, and, lymphatics, for, long, periods, of, time, sometimes, as, long, as, 17, weeks, in, a, small, percentage, of, cases, it, can, spread, and, replicate, in, other, sites, such, as, brown, fat, the, reticuloendothelial, tissues, and, muscle, this, sustained, replication, causes, a, major, viremia, and, leads, to, the, development, of, minor, influenza, like, symptoms, rarely, this, may, progress, and, the, virus, may, invade, the, central, nervous, system, provoking, a, local, inflammatory, response, in, most, cases, this, causes, a, self, limiting, inflammation, of, the, meninges, the, layers, of, tissue, surrounding, the, brain, which, is, known, as, nonparalytic, aseptic, meningitis, penetration, of, the, cns, provides, no, known, benefit, to, the, virus, and, is, quite, possibly, an, incidental, deviation, of, a, normal, gastrointestinal, infection, the, mechanisms, by, which, poliovirus, spreads, to, the, cns, are, poorly, understood, but, it, appears, to, be, primarily, a, chance, event, largely, independent, of, the, age, gender, or, socioeconomic, position, of, the, individual, in, around, one, percent, of, infections, poliovirus, spreads, along, certain, nerve, fiber, pathways, preferentially, replicating, in, and, destroying, motor, neurons, within, the, spinal, cord, brain, stem, or, motor, cortex, this, leads, to, the, development, of, paralytic, poliomyelitis, the, various, forms, of, which, spinal, bulbar, and, bulbospinal, vary, only, with, the, amount, of, neuronal, damage, and, inflammation, that, occurs, and, the, region, of, the, cns, affected, the, destruction, of, neuronal, cells, produces, lesions, within, the, spinal, ganglia, these, may, also, occur, in, the, reticular, formation, vestibular, nuclei, cerebellar, vermis, and, deep, cerebellar, nuclei, inflammation, associated, with, nerve, cell, destruction, often, alters, the, color, and, appearance, of, the, gray, matter, in, the, spinal, column, causing, it, to, appear, reddish, and, swollen, other, destructive, changes, associated, with, paralytic, disease, occur, in, the, forebrain, region, specifically, the, hypothalamus, and, thalamus, early, symptoms, of, paralytic, polio, include, high, fever, headache, stiffness, in, the, back, and, neck, asymmetrical, weakness, of, various, muscles, sensitivity, to, touch, difficulty, swallowing, muscle, pain, loss, of, superficial, and, deep, reflexes, paresthesia, pins, and, needles, irritability, constipation, or, difficulty, urinating, paralysis, generally, develops, one, to, ten, days, after, early, symptoms, begin, progresses, for, two, to, three, days, and, is, usually, complete, by, the, time, the, fever, breaks, the, likelihood, of, developing, paralytic, polio, increases, with, age, as, does, the, extent, of, paralysis, in, children, nonparalytic, meningitis, is, the, most, likely, consequence, of, cns, involvement, and, paralysis, occurs, in, only, one, in, 1000, cases, in, adults, paralysis, occurs, in, one, in, 75, cases, in, children, under, five, years, of, age, paralysis, of, one, leg, is, most, common, in, adults, extensive, paralysis, of, the, chest, and, abdomen, also, affecting, all, four, limbs, quadriplegia, is, more, likely, paralysis, rates, also, vary, depending, on, the, serotype, of, the, infecting, poliovirus, the, highest, rates, of, paralysis, one, in, 200, are, associated, with, poliovirus, type, 1, the, lowest, rates, one, in, 2, 000, are, associated, with, type, 2, spinal, polio, the, most, common, form, of, paralytic, poliomyelitis, results, from, viral, invasion, of, the, motor, neurons, of, the, anterior, horn, cells, or, the, ventral, front, grey, matter, section, in, the, spinal, column, which, are, responsible, for, movement, of, the, muscles, including, those, of, the, trunk, limbs, and, the, intercostal, muscles, virus, invasion, causes, inflammation, of, the, nerve, cells, leading, to, damage, or, destruction, of, motor, neuron, ganglia, when, spinal, neurons, die, wallerian, degeneration, takes, place, leading, to, weakness, of, those, muscles, formerly, innervated, by, the, now, dead, neurons, with, the, destruction, of, nerve, cells, the, muscles, no, longer, receive, signals, from, the, brain, or, spinal, cord, without, nerve, stimulation, the, muscles, atrophy, becoming, weak, floppy, and, poorly, controlled, and, finally, completely, paralyzed, maximum, paralysis, progresses, rapidly, two, to, four, days, and, usually, involves, fever, and, muscle, pain, deep, tendon, reflexes, are, also, affected, and, are, typically, absent, or, diminished, sensation, the, ability, to, feel, in, the, paralyzed, limbs, however, is, not, affected, the, extent, of, spinal, paralysis, depends, on, the, region, of, the, cord, affected, which, may, be, cervical, thoracic, or, lumbar, the, virus, may, affect, muscles, on, both, sides, of, the, body, but, more, often, the, paralysis, is, asymmetrical, any, limb, or, combination, of, limbs, may, be, affected, one, leg, one, arm, or, both, legs, and, both, arms, paralysis, is, often, more, severe, proximally, where, the, limb, joins, the, body, than, distally, the, fingertips, and, toes, making, up, about, two, percent, of, cases, of, paralytic, polio, bulbar, polio, occurs, when, poliovirus, invades, and, destroys, nerves, within, the, bulbar, region, of, the, brain, stem, the, bulbar, region, is, a, white, matter, pathway, that, connects, the, cerebral, cortex, to, the, brain, stem, the, destruction, of, these, nerves, weakens, the, muscles, supplied, by, the, cranial, nerves, producing, symptoms, of, encephalitis, and, causes, difficulty, breathing, speaking, and, swallowing, critical, nerves, affected, are, the, glossopharyngeal, nerve, which, partially, controls, swallowing, and, functions, in, the, throat, tongue, movement, and, taste, the, vagus, nerve, which, sends, signals, to, the, heart, intestines, and, lungs, and, the, accessory, nerve, which, controls, upper, neck, movement, due, to, the, effect, on, swallowing, secretions, of, mucus, may, build, up, in, the, airway, causing, suffocation, other, signs, and, symptoms, include, facial, weakness, caused, by, destruction, of, the, trigeminal, nerve, and, facial, nerve, which, innervate, the, cheeks, tear, ducts, gums, and, muscles, of, the, face, among, other, structures, double, vision, difficulty, in, chewing, and, abnormal, respiratory, rate, depth, and, rhythm, which, may, lead, to, respiratory, arrest, pulmonary, edema, and, shock, are, also, possible, and, may, be, fatal, approximately, 19, percent, of, all, paralytic, polio, cases, have, both, bulbar, and, spinal, symptoms, this, subtype, is, called, respiratory, or, bulbospinal, polio, here, the, virus, affects, the, upper, part, of, the, cervical, spinal, cord, cervical, vertebrae, c3, through, c5, and, paralysis, of, the, diaphragm, occurs, the, critical, nerves, affected, are, the, phrenic, nerve, which, drives, the, diaphragm, to, inflate, the, lungs, and, those, that, drive, the, muscles, needed, for, swallowing, by, destroying, these, nerves, this, form, of, polio, affects, breathing, making, it, difficult, or, impossible, for, the, patient, to, breathe, without, the, support, of, a, ventilator, it, can, lead, to, paralysis, of, the, arms, and, legs, and, may, also, affect, swallowing, and, heart, functions, paralytic, poliomyelitis, may, be, clinically, suspected, in, individuals, experiencing, acute, onset, of, flaccid, paralysis, in, one, or, more, limbs, with, decreased, or, absent, tendon, reflexes, in, the, affected, limbs, that, cannot, be, attributed, to, another, apparent, cause, and, without, sensory, or, cognitive, loss, a, laboratory, diagnosis, is, usually, made, based, on, the, recovery, of, poliovirus, from, a, stool, sample, or, a, swab, of, the, pharynx, rarely, it, may, be, possible, to, identify, poliovirus, in, the, blood, or, in, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, poliovirus, samples, are, further, analysed, using, reverse, transcription, polymerase, chain, reaction, rt, pcr, or, genomic, sequencing, to, determine, the, serotype, i, e, 1, 2, or, 3, and, whether, the, virus, is, a, wild, or, vaccine, derived, strain, in, 1950, william, hammon, at, the, university, of, pittsburgh, purified, the, gamma, globulin, component, of, the, blood, plasma, of, polio, survivors, hammon, proposed, the, gamma, globulin, which, contained, antibodies, to, poliovirus, could, be, used, to, halt, poliovirus, infection, prevent, disease, and, reduce, the, severity, of, disease, in, other, patients, who, had, contracted, polio, the, results, of, a, large, clinical, trial, were, promising, the, gamma, globulin, was, shown, to, be, about, 80, percent, effective, in, preventing, the, development, of, paralytic, poliomyelitis, it, was, also, shown, to, reduce, the, severity, of, the, disease, in, patients, who, developed, polio, due, to, the, limited, supply, of, blood, plasma, gamma, globulin, was, later, deemed, impractical, for, widespread, use, and, the, medical, community, focused, on, the, development, of, a, polio, vaccine, two, types, of, vaccine, are, used, throughout, the, world, to, combat, polio, an, inactivated, poliovirus, given, by, injection, and, a, weakened, poliovirus, given, by, mouth, both, types, induce, immunity, to, polio, and, are, effective, in, protecting, individuals, from, disease, the, inactivated, polio, vaccine, ipv, was, developed, in, 1952, by, jonas, salk, at, the, university, of, pittsburgh, and, announced, to, the, world, on, 12, april, 1955, the, salk, vaccine, is, based, on, poliovirus, grown, in, a, type, of, monkey, kidney, tissue, culture, vero, cell, line, which, is, chemically, inactivated, with, formalin, after, two, doses, of, ipv, given, by, injection, 90, percent, or, more, of, individuals, develop, protective, antibody, to, all, three, serotypes, of, poliovirus, and, at, least, 99, percent, are, immune, to, poliovirus, following, three, doses, subsequently, albert, sabin, developed, a, polio, vaccine, that, can, be, administered, orally, oral, polio, vaccine, opv, comprising, a, live, attenuated, virus, it, was, produced, by, the, repeated, passage, of, the, virus, through, nonhuman, cells, at, sub, physiological, temperatures, the, attenuated, poliovirus, in, the, sabin, vaccine, replicates, very, efficiently, in, the, gut, the, primary, site, of, wild, poliovirus, infection, and, replication, but, the, vaccine, strain, is, unable, to, replicate, efficiently, within, nervous, system, tissue, a, single, dose, of, sabin, s, trivalent, opv, produces, immunity, to, all, three, poliovirus, serotypes, in, about, 50, percent, of, recipients, three, doses, of, opv, produce, protective, antibody, to, all, three, poliovirus, types, in, more, than, 95, percent, of, recipients, human, trials, of, sabin, s, vaccine, began, in, 1957, and, in, 1958, it, was, selected, in, competition, with, the, live, attenuated, vaccines, of, koprowski, and, other, researchers, by, the, us, national, institutes, of, health, licensed, in, 1962, it, rapidly, became, the, only, oral, polio, vaccine, used, worldwide, opv, efficiently, blocks, person, to, person, transmission, of, wild, poliovirus, by, oral, oral, and, fecal, oral, routes, thereby, protecting, both, individual, vaccine, recipients, and, the, wider, community, the, live, attenuated, virus, may, be, transmitted, from, vaccinees, to, their, unvaccinated, contacts, resulting, in, wider, community, immunity, ipv, confers, good, immunity, but, is, less, effective, at, preventing, spread, of, wild, poliovirus, by, the, fecal, oral, route, because, the, oral, polio, vaccine, is, inexpensive, easy, to, administer, and, produces, excellent, immunity, in, the, intestine, which, helps, prevent, infection, with, wild, virus, in, areas, where, it, is, endemic, it, has, been, the, vaccine, of, choice, for, controlling, poliomyelitis, in, many, countries, on, very, rare, occasions, the, attenuated, virus, in, the, sabin, opv, can, revert, into, a, form, that, can, paralyze, in, 2017, cases, caused, by, vaccine, derived, poliovirus, cvdpv, outnumbered, wild, poliovirus, cases, for, the, first, time, due, to, wild, polio, cases, hitting, record, lows, most, industrialized, countries, have, switched, to, inactivated, polio, vaccine, which, cannot, revert, either, as, the, sole, vaccine, against, poliomyelitis, or, in, combination, with, oral, polio, vaccine, an, improved, oral, vaccine, novel, oral, polio, vaccine, type, 2, nopv2, began, development, in, 2011, and, was, granted, emergency, licencing, in, 2021, and, subsequently, full, licensure, in, december, 2023, this, has, greater, genetic, stability, than, the, traditional, oral, vaccine, and, is, less, likely, to, revert, to, a, virulent, form, there, is, no, cure, for, polio, but, there, are, treatments, the, focus, of, modern, treatment, has, been, on, providing, relief, of, symptoms, speeding, recovery, and, preventing, complications, supportive, measures, include, antibiotics, to, prevent, infections, in, weakened, muscles, analgesics, for, pain, moderate, exercise, and, a, nutritious, diet, treatment, of, polio, often, requires, long, term, rehabilitation, including, occupational, therapy, physical, therapy, braces, corrective, shoes, and, in, some, cases, orthopedic, surgery, portable, ventilators, may, be, required, to, support, breathing, historically, a, noninvasive, negative, pressure, ventilator, more, commonly, called, an, iron, lung, was, used, to, artificially, maintain, respiration, during, an, acute, polio, infection, until, a, person, could, breathe, independently, generally, about, one, to, two, weeks, the, use, of, iron, lungs, is, largely, obsolete, in, modern, medicine, as, more, modern, breathing, therapies, have, been, developed, and, due, to, the, eradication, of, polio, in, most, of, the, world, other, historical, treatments, for, polio, include, hydrotherapy, electrotherapy, massage, and, passive, motion, exercises, and, surgical, treatments, such, as, tendon, lengthening, and, nerve, grafting, patients, with, abortive, polio, infections, recover, completely, in, those, who, develop, only, aseptic, meningitis, the, symptoms, can, be, expected, to, persist, for, two, to, ten, days, followed, by, complete, recovery, in, cases, of, spinal, polio, if, the, affected, nerve, cells, are, completely, destroyed, paralysis, will, be, permanent, cells, that, are, not, destroyed, but, lose, function, temporarily, may, recover, within, four, to, six, weeks, after, onset, half, the, patients, with, spinal, polio, recover, fully, one, quarter, recover, with, mild, disability, and, the, remaining, quarter, are, left, with, severe, disability, the, degree, of, both, acute, paralysis, and, residual, paralysis, is, likely, to, be, proportional, to, the, degree, of, viremia, and, inversely, proportional, to, the, degree, of, immunity, spinal, polio, is, rarely, fatal, without, respiratory, support, consequences, of, poliomyelitis, with, respiratory, involvement, include, suffocation, or, pneumonia, from, aspiration, of, secretions, overall, 5, to, 10, percent, of, patients, with, paralytic, polio, die, due, to, the, paralysis, of, muscles, used, for, breathing, the, case, fatality, rate, cfr, varies, by, age, 2, to, 5, percent, of, children, and, up, to, 15, to, 30, percent, of, adults, die, bulbar, polio, often, causes, death, if, respiratory, support, is, not, provided, with, support, its, cfr, ranges, from, 25, to, 75, percent, depending, on, the, age, of, the, patient, when, intermittent, positive, pressure, ventilation, is, available, the, fatalities, can, be, reduced, to, 15, percent, many, cases, of, poliomyelitis, result, in, only, temporary, paralysis, generally, in, these, cases, nerve, impulses, return, to, the, paralyzed, muscle, within, a, month, and, recovery, is, complete, in, six, to, eight, months, the, neurophysiological, processes, involved, in, recovery, following, acute, paralytic, poliomyelitis, are, quite, effective, muscles, are, able, to, retain, normal, strength, even, if, half, the, original, motor, neurons, have, been, lost, paralysis, remaining, after, one, year, is, likely, to, be, permanent, although, some, recovery, of, muscle, strength, is, possible, up, to, 18, months, after, infection, one, mechanism, involved, in, recovery, is, nerve, terminal, sprouting, in, which, remaining, brainstem, and, spinal, cord, motor, neurons, develop, new, branches, or, axonal, sprouts, these, sprouts, can, reinnervate, orphaned, muscle, fibers, that, have, been, denervated, by, acute, polio, infection, restoring, the, fibers, capacity, to, contract, and, improving, strength, terminal, sprouting, may, generate, a, few, significantly, enlarged, motor, neurons, doing, work, previously, performed, by, as, many, as, four, or, five, units, a, single, motor, neuron, that, once, controlled, 200, muscle, cells, might, control, 800, to, 1000, cells, other, mechanisms, that, occur, during, the, rehabilitation, phase, and, contribute, to, muscle, strength, restoration, include, myofiber, hypertrophy, enlargement, of, muscle, fibers, through, exercise, and, activity, and, transformation, of, type, ii, muscle, fibers, to, type, i, muscle, fibers, in, addition, to, these, physiological, processes, the, body, can, compensate, for, residual, paralysis, in, other, ways, weaker, muscles, can, be, used, at, a, higher, than, usual, intensity, relative, to, the, muscle, s, maximal, capacity, little, used, muscles, can, be, developed, and, ligaments, can, enable, stability, and, mobility, residual, complications, of, paralytic, polio, often, occur, following, the, initial, recovery, process, muscle, paresis, and, paralysis, can, sometimes, result, in, skeletal, deformities, tightening, of, the, joints, and, movement, disability, once, the, muscles, in, the, limb, become, flaccid, they, may, interfere, with, the, function, of, other, muscles, a, typical, manifestation, of, this, problem, is, equinus, foot, similar, to, club, foot, this, deformity, develops, when, the, muscles, that, pull, the, toes, downward, are, working, but, those, that, pull, it, upward, are, not, and, the, foot, naturally, tends, to, drop, toward, the, ground, if, the, problem, is, left, untreated, the, achilles, tendons, at, the, back, of, the, foot, retract, and, the, foot, cannot, take, on, a, normal, position, people, with, polio, that, develop, equinus, foot, cannot, walk, properly, because, they, cannot, put, their, heels, on, the, ground, a, similar, situation, can, develop, if, the, arms, become, paralyzed, in, some, cases, the, growth, of, an, affected, leg, is, slowed, by, polio, while, the, other, leg, continues, to, grow, normally, the, result, is, that, one, leg, is, shorter, than, the, other, and, the, person, limps, and, leans, to, one, side, in, turn, leading, to, deformities, of, the, spine, such, as, scoliosis, osteoporosis, and, increased, likelihood, of, bone, fractures, may, occur, an, intervention, to, prevent, or, lessen, length, disparity, can, be, to, perform, an, epiphysiodesis, on, the, distal, femoral, and, proximal, tibial, fibular, condyles, so, that, limb, s, growth, is, artificially, stunted, and, by, the, time, of, epiphyseal, growth, plate, closure, the, legs, are, more, equal, in, length, alternatively, a, person, can, be, fitted, with, custom, made, footwear, which, corrects, the, difference, in, leg, lengths, other, surgery, to, re, balance, muscular, agonist, antagonist, imbalances, may, also, be, helpful, extended, use, of, braces, or, wheelchairs, may, cause, compression, neuropathy, as, well, as, a, loss, of, proper, function, of, the, veins, in, the, legs, due, to, pooling, of, blood, in, paralyzed, lower, limbs, complications, from, prolonged, immobility, involving, the, lungs, kidneys, and, heart, include, pulmonary, edema, aspiration, pneumonia, urinary, tract, infections, kidney, stones, paralytic, ileus, myocarditis, and, cor, pulmonale, between, 25, percent, and, 50, percent, of, individuals, who, have, recovered, from, paralytic, polio, in, childhood, can, develop, additional, symptoms, decades, after, recovering, from, the, acute, infection, notably, new, muscle, weakness, and, extreme, fatigue, this, condition, is, known, as, post, polio, syndrome, pps, or, post, polio, sequelae, the, symptoms, of, pps, are, thought, to, involve, a, failure, of, the, oversized, motor, units, created, during, the, recovery, phase, of, the, paralytic, disease, contributing, factors, that, increase, the, risk, of, pps, include, aging, with, loss, of, neuron, units, the, presence, of, a, permanent, residual, impairment, after, recovery, from, the, acute, illness, and, both, overuse, and, disuse, of, neurons, pps, is, a, slow, progressive, disease, and, there, is, no, specific, treatment, for, it, post, polio, syndrome, is, not, an, infectious, process, and, persons, experiencing, the, syndrome, do, not, shed, poliovirus, paralysis, length, differences, and, deformations, of, the, lower, extremities, can, lead, to, a, hindrance, when, walking, with, compensation, mechanisms, that, lead, to, a, severe, impairment, of, the, gait, pattern, in, order, to, be, able, to, stand, and, walk, safely, and, to, improve, the, gait, pattern, orthotics, can, be, included, in, the, therapy, concept, today, modern, materials, and, functional, elements, enable, the, orthosis, to, be, specifically, adapted, to, the, requirements, resulting, from, the, patient, s, gait, mechanical, stance, phase, control, knee, joints, may, secure, the, knee, joint, in, the, early, stance, phases, and, release, again, for, knee, flexion, when, the, swing, phase, is, initiated, with, the, help, of, an, orthotic, treatment, with, a, stance, phase, control, knee, joint, a, natural, gait, pattern, can, be, achieved, despite, mechanical, protection, against, unwanted, knee, flexion, in, these, cases, locked, knee, joints, are, often, used, which, have, a, good, safety, function, but, do, not, allow, knee, flexion, when, walking, during, swing, phase, with, such, joints, the, knee, joint, remains, mechanically, blocked, during, the, swing, phase, patients, with, locked, knee, joints, must, swing, the, leg, forward, with, the, knee, extended, even, during, the, swing, phase, this, only, works, if, the, patient, develops, compensatory, mechanisms, e, g, by, raising, the, body, s, center, of, gravity, in, the, swing, phase, duchenne, limping, or, by, swinging, the, orthotic, leg, to, the, side, circumduction, major, polio, epidemics, were, unknown, before, the, 20th, century, up, until, that, time, polio, was, an, endemic, disease, worldwide, mothers, who, had, survived, polio, infection, passed, on, temporary, immunity, to, their, babies, in, the, womb, and, through, breast, milk, as, a, result, an, infant, who, encountered, a, polio, infection, generally, suffered, only, mild, symptoms, and, acquired, a, long, term, immunity, to, the, disease, with, improvements, in, sanitation, and, hygiene, during, the, 19th, century, the, general, level, of, herd, immunity, in, the, population, declined, providing, circumstances, where, epidemics, of, polio, became, frequent, it, is, estimated, that, epidemic, polio, killed, or, paralysed, over, half, a, million, people, every, year, following, the, widespread, use, of, poliovirus, vaccine, in, the, mid, 1950s, new, cases, of, poliomyelitis, declined, dramatically, in, many, industrialized, countries, efforts, to, completely, eradicate, the, disease, started, in, 1988, and, are, ongoing, the, oral, polio, vaccine, while, highly, effective, has, the, disadvantage, that, it, contains, a, live, virus, which, has, been, attenuated, so, that, it, cannot, cause, severe, illness, the, vaccine, virus, is, excreted, in, the, stool, and, in, under, immunized, communities, it, can, spread, from, person, to, person, this, is, known, as, circulating, vaccine, derived, poliovirus, cvdpv, or, more, simply, as, variant, poliovirus, with, prolonged, transmission, of, this, kind, the, weakened, virus, can, mutate, and, revert, to, a, form, that, causes, illness, and, paralysis, cases, of, cvdpv, now, exceed, wild, type, cases, making, it, desirable, to, discontinue, the, use, of, the, oral, polio, vaccine, as, soon, as, safely, possible, and, instead, use, other, types, of, polio, vaccines, a, global, effort, to, eradicate, polio, the, global, polio, eradication, initiative, began, in, 1988, led, by, the, world, health, organization, unicef, and, the, rotary, foundation, polio, is, one, of, only, two, diseases, currently, the, subject, of, a, global, eradication, program, the, other, being, guinea, worm, disease, so, far, the, only, diseases, completely, eradicated, by, humankind, are, smallpox, declared, eradicated, in, 1980, and, rinderpest, declared, eradicated, in, 2011, in, april, 2012, the, world, health, assembly, declared, that, the, failure, to, completely, eradicate, polio, would, be, a, programmatic, emergency, for, global, public, health, and, that, it, must, not, happen, these, efforts, have, hugely, reduced, the, number, of, cases, from, an, estimated, 350, 000, cases, in, 1988, to, a, low, of, 483, cases, in, 2001, after, which, it, remained, at, a, level, of, about, 1, 000, 2000, cases, per, year, for, a, number, of, years, by, 2015, polio, was, believed, to, remain, naturally, spreading, in, only, two, countries, pakistan, and, afghanistan, although, it, continued, to, cause, outbreaks, in, other, nearby, countries, due, to, hidden, or, re, established, transmission, global, surveillance, for, polio, takes, two, forms, cases, of, acute, flaccid, paralysis, afp, are, tested, for, the, presence, and, type, of, poliovirus, in, addition, environmental, and, wastewater, samples, are, tested, for, the, presence, of, poliovirus, this, is, an, effective, method, of, detecting, circulating, virus, which, has, not, given, rise, to, severe, symptoms, here, is, a, summary, of, both, wild, polio, wpv, and, variant, polio, cvdpv, prevalence, over, the, last, 5, years, the, last, remaining, region, with, wild, polio, cases, are, the, south, asian, countries, afghanistan, and, pakistan, during, 2011, the, cia, ran, a, fake, hepatitis, vaccination, clinic, in, abbottabad, pakistan, in, an, attempt, to, locate, osama, bin, laden, this, destroyed, trust, in, vaccination, programs, in, the, region, there, were, attacks, and, deaths, among, vaccination, workers, 66, vaccinators, were, killed, in, 2013, and, 2014, in, afghanistan, the, taliban, banned, house, to, house, polio, vaccination, between, 2018, and, 2021, these, factors, have, set, back, efforts, to, eliminate, polio, by, means, of, vaccination, in, these, countries, in, afghanistan, 80, cases, of, polio, were, reported, from, 35, districts, during, 2011, incidence, over, the, subsequent, 10, years, has, declined, to, just, 4, cases, in, 2, districts, during, 2021, in, pakistan, cases, dropped, by, 97, percent, from, 2014, to, 2018, reasons, include, 440, million, dirham, support, from, the, united, arab, emirates, to, vaccinate, more, than, ten, million, children, changes, in, the, military, situation, and, arrests, of, some, of, those, who, attacked, polio, workers, the, americas, were, declared, polio, free, in, 1994, the, last, known, case, was, a, boy, in, peru, in, 1991, the, us, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, recommends, polio, vaccination, boosters, for, travelers, and, those, who, live, in, countries, where, the, disease, is, endemic, in, july, 2022, the, us, state, of, new, york, reported, a, polio, case, for, the, first, time, in, almost, a, decade, in, the, country, this, was, attributed, to, a, vaccine, derived, strain, of, the, virus, in, 2000, polio, was, declared, to, have, been, officially, eliminated, in, 37, western, pacific, countries, including, china, and, australia, despite, eradication, ten, years, earlier, an, outbreak, was, confirmed, in, china, in, september, 2011, involving, a, strain, common, in, pakistan, in, september, 2019, the, department, of, health, of, the, philippines, declared, a, polio, outbreak, in, the, country, after, a, single, case, in, a, 3, year, old, girl, in, december, 2019, acute, poliomyelitis, was, confirmed, in, an, infant, in, sabah, state, borneo, malaysia, subsequently, a, further, three, polio, cases, were, reported, with, the, last, case, reported, in, january, 2020, both, outbreaks, were, found, to, be, linked, instances, of, vaccine, derived, poliomyelitis, europe, was, declared, polio, free, in, 2002, on, 27, march, 2014, the, who, announced, the, eradication, of, poliomyelitis, in, the, south, east, asia, region, which, includes, eleven, countries, bangladesh, bhutan, north, korea, india, indonesia, maldives, myanmar, nepal, sri, lanka, thailand, and, timor, leste, with, the, addition, of, this, region, 80, per, cent, of, the, world, population, was, considered, to, be, living, in, polio, free, regions, in, syria, difficulties, in, executing, immunization, programs, in, the, ongoing, civil, war, led, to, a, return, of, polio, probably, in, 2012, acknowledged, by, the, who, in, 2013, 15, cases, were, confirmed, among, children, in, syria, between, october, and, november, 2013, in, deir, ezzor, later, two, more, cases, one, each, in, rural, damascus, and, aleppo, were, identified, it, was, the, first, outbreak, in, syria, since, 1999, doctors, and, international, public, health, agencies, report, more, than, 90, cases, of, polio, in, syria, with, fears, of, contagion, in, rebel, areas, from, lack, of, sanitation, and, safe, water, services, a, vaccination, campaign, in, syria, operated, literally, under, fire, and, led, to, the, deaths, of, several, vaccinators, but, returned, vaccination, coverage, to, pre, war, levels, syria, is, currently, free, of, polio, but, is, considered, at, risk, in, 2024, the, gaza, health, ministry, reported, that, several, children, have, shown, symptoms, consistent, with, polio, with, laboratory, tests, confirming, that, a, 10, month, old, child, is, infected, with, the, virus, prior, to, the, israel, hamas, conflict, 99, of, gaza, s, 2, 2, million, residents, were, vaccinated, against, polio, but, that, rate, has, since, fallen, to, 86, according, to, the, who, united, nations, secretary, general, ant, nio, guterres, urged, for, a, weeklong, cease, fire, in, gaza, to, facilitate, vaccinations, and, prevent, a, potential, polio, outbreak, emphasizing, the, risk, faced, by, many, children, in, 2003, in, northern, nigeria, a, country, that, at, that, time, was, considered, provisionally, polio, free, a, fatwa, was, issued, declaring, that, the, polio, vaccine, was, designed, to, render, children, sterile, subsequently, polio, reappeared, in, nigeria, and, spread, from, there, to, several, other, countries, in, 2013, nine, health, workers, administering, polio, vaccine, were, targeted, and, killed, by, gunmen, on, motorcycles, in, kano, but, this, was, the, only, attack, local, traditional, and, religious, leaders, and, polio, survivors, worked, to, revive, the, campaign, and, nigeria, was, removed, from, the, polio, endemic, list, in, september, 2015, after, more, than, a, year, without, any, cases, only, to, be, restored, to, the, list, in, 2016, when, two, cases, were, detected, africa, was, declared, free, of, wild, polio, in, august, 2020, although, cases, of, circulating, vaccine, derived, poliovirus, type, 2, continue, to, appear, in, several, countries, a, single, case, of, wild, polio, that, was, detected, in, malawi, in, february, 2022, and, another, in, mozambique, in, may, 2022, were, both, of, a, strain, imported, from, pakistan, and, do, not, affect, the, african, region, s, wild, poliovirus, free, certification, status, the, effects, of, polio, have, been, known, since, prehistory, egyptian, paintings, and, carvings, depict, otherwise, healthy, people, with, withered, limbs, and, young, children, walking, with, canes, the, earliest, known, case, of, polio, is, indicated, by, the, remains, of, a, teenage, girl, discovered, in, a, 4000, year, old, burial, site, in, the, united, arab, emirates, exhibiting, characteristic, symptoms, of, the, condition, the, first, clinical, description, was, provided, by, the, english, physician, michael, underwood, in, 1789, where, he, refers, to, polio, as, a, debility, of, the, lower, extremities, the, work, of, physicians, jakob, heine, in, 1840, and, karl, oskar, medin, in, 1890, led, to, it, being, known, as, heine, medin, disease, the, disease, was, later, called, infantile, paralysis, based, on, its, propensity, to, affect, children, before, the, 20th, century, polio, infections, were, rarely, seen, in, infants, before, six, months, of, age, most, cases, occurring, in, children, six, months, to, four, years, of, age, poorer, sanitation, of, the, time, resulted, in, constant, exposure, to, the, virus, which, enhanced, a, natural, immunity, within, the, population, in, developed, countries, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, improvements, were, made, in, community, sanitation, including, better, sewage, disposal, and, clean, water, supplies, these, changes, drastically, increased, the, proportion, of, children, and, adults, at, risk, of, paralytic, polio, infection, by, reducing, childhood, exposure, and, immunity, to, the, disease, small, localized, paralytic, polio, epidemics, began, to, appear, in, europe, and, the, united, states, around, 1900, outbreaks, reached, pandemic, proportions, in, europe, north, america, australia, and, new, zealand, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, by, 1950, the, peak, age, incidence, of, paralytic, poliomyelitis, in, the, united, states, had, shifted, from, infants, to, children, aged, five, to, nine, years, when, the, risk, of, paralysis, is, greater, about, one, third, of, the, cases, were, reported, in, persons, over, 15, years, of, age, accordingly, the, rate, of, paralysis, and, death, due, to, polio, infection, also, increased, during, this, time, in, the, united, states, the, 1952, polio, epidemic, became, the, worst, outbreak, in, the, nation, s, history, of, the, nearly, 58, 000, cases, reported, that, year, 3, 145, died, and, 21, 269, were, left, with, mild, to, disabling, paralysis, intensive, care, medicine, has, its, origin, in, the, fight, against, polio, most, hospitals, in, the, 1950s, had, limited, access, to, iron, lungs, for, patients, unable, to, breathe, without, mechanical, assistance, respiratory, centers, designed, to, assist, the, most, severe, polio, patients, first, established, in, 1952, at, the, blegdam, hospital, of, copenhagen, by, danish, anesthesiologist, bj, rn, ibsen, were, the, precursors, of, modern, intensive, care, units, icu, a, year, later, ibsen, would, establish, the, world, s, first, dedicated, icu, the, polio, epidemics, not, only, altered, the, lives, of, those, who, survived, them, but, also, brought, profound, cultural, changes, spurring, grassroots, fund, raising, campaigns, that, would, revolutionize, medical, philanthropy, and, giving, rise, to, the, modern, field, of, rehabilitation, therapy, as, one, of, the, largest, disabled, groups, in, the, world, polio, survivors, also, helped, to, advance, the, modern, disability, rights, movement, through, campaigns, for, the, social, and, civil, rights, of, the, disabled, the, world, health, organization, estimates, that, there, are, 10, to, 20, million, polio, survivors, worldwide, in, 1977, there, were, 254, 000, persons, living, in, the, united, states, who, had, been, paralyzed, by, polio, according, to, doctors, and, local, polio, support, groups, some, 40, 000, polio, survivors, with, varying, degrees, of, paralysis, were, living, in, germany, 30, 000, in, japan, 24, 000, in, france, 16, 000, in, australia, 12, 000, in, canada, and, 12, 000, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 2001, many, notable, individuals, have, survived, polio, and, often, credit, the, prolonged, immobility, and, residual, paralysis, associated, with, polio, as, a, driving, force, in, their, lives, and, careers, the, disease, was, very, well, publicized, during, the, polio, epidemics, of, the, 1950s, with, extensive, media, coverage, of, any, scientific, advancements, that, might, lead, to, a, cure, thus, the, scientists, working, on, polio, became, some, of, the, most, famous, of, the, century, fifteen, scientists, and, two, laymen, who, made, important, contributions, to, the, knowledge, and, treatment, of, poliomyelitis, are, honored, by, the, polio, hall, of, fame, which, was, dedicated, in, 1957, at, the, roosevelt, warm, springs, institute, for, rehabilitation, in, warm, springs, georgia, us, in, 2008, four, organizations, rotary, international, the, world, health, organization, the, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, and, unicef, were, added, to, the, hall, of, fame, world, polio, day, 24, october, as, an, annual, day, of, awareness, was, established, by, rotary, international, to, commemorate, the, birth, of, jonas, salk, who, led, the, first, team, to, develop, a, vaccine, against, poliomyelitis, a, global, effort, to, eradicate, polio, the, global, polio, eradication, initiative, gpei, began, in, 1988, led, by, the, world, health, organization, unicef, and, the, rotary, foundation, since, then, international, cooperation, led, by, gpei, has, reduced, polio, worldwide, by, 99, percent, and, the, campaign, is, ongoing, in, 2010, wild, poliovirus, was, discovered, through, importation, in, 13, different, countries, they, were, chad, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, the, republic, of, congo, kazakhstan, liberia, mali, nepal, niger, the, russian, federation, senegal, tajikistan, turkmenistan, and, uganda, in, 2021, types, 2, and, 3, were, fully, eradicated, from, every, country, however, type, 1, cases, still, remain, in, pakistan, and, afghanistan, a, majority, of, countries, have, successfully, eradicated, polio, with, pakistan, and, afghanistan, being, the, last, countries, with, endemic, cases, of, poliovirus, the, following, countries, have, been, considered, polio, free, but, not, confirmed, as, of, april, 2024, somalia, djibouti, sudan, egypt, libya, tunisia, morocco, palestine, lebanon, syria, jordan, saudi, arabia, bahrain, qatar, oman, yemen, the, uae, iraq, kuwait, and, iran, since, 2018, global, polio, eradication, initiative, gpei, has, coordinated, efforts, both, to, eliminate, polio, and, to, research, means, of, improving, surveillance, and, prevention, the, at, the, peak, of, its, work, the, programme, directly, employed, 4000, people, across, 75, countries, and, managed, a, budget, of, nearly, u, s, 1, billion, as, of, 2021, the, gpei, had, raised, 18, billion, dollars, in, funding, with, annual, contributions, around, 800, million, to, 1, billion, dollars, around, 30, of, the, funding, came, from, the, gates, foundation, 30, from, developed, governments, 27, from, countries, at, risk, of, polio, and, the, rest, was, made, up, of, donations, from, nonprofits, private, funders, and, other, foundations, the, gpei, has, identified, six, directions, for, continuing, research, even, if, polio, can, be, eliminated, completely, from, the, world, population, vaccination, programs, should, continue, for, at, least, ten, years, the, retention, of, live, poliovirus, samples, in, laboratories, and, vaccine, manufacturing, facilities, which, carry, a, risk, of, escape, of, the, virus, should, progressively, be, reduced, to, support, these, two, objectives, vaccines, are, under, development, which, either, utilise, a, virus, like, particle, or, which, derive, from, a, modified, virus, which, cannot, reproduce, in, a, human, host, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease
