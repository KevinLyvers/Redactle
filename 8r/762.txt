procyonidae, p, r, o, s, i, n, d, i, proh, see, on, i, dee, is, a, new, world, family, of, the, order, carnivora, it, includes, the, raccoons, ringtails, cacomistles, coatis, kinkajous, olingos, and, olinguitos, procyonids, inhabit, a, wide, range, of, environments, and, are, generally, omnivorous, procyonids, are, relatively, small, animals, with, generally, slender, bodies, and, long, tails, though, the, common, raccoon, tends, to, be, bulky, because, of, their, general, build, the, procyonidae, are, often, popularly, viewed, as, smaller, cousins, of, the, bear, family, this, is, apparent, in, their, german, name, kleinb, ren, small, bears, including, the, names, of, the, species, a, raccoon, is, called, a, waschb, r, washing, bear, as, it, washes, its, food, before, eating, a, coati, is, a, nasenb, r, nose, bear, while, a, kinkajou, is, a, honigb, r, honey, bear, dutch, follows, suit, calling, the, animals, wasbeer, neusbeer, and, rolstaartbeer, curl, tail, bear, respectively, however, it, is, now, believed, that, procyonids, are, more, closely, related, to, mustelids, than, to, bears, procyonids, share, common, morphological, characteristics, including, a, shortened, rostrum, absent, alisphenoid, canals, and, a, relatively, flat, mandibular, fossa, kinkajous, have, unique, morphological, characteristics, due, to, their, arboreally, adapted, locomotion, including, a, prehensile, tail, and, unique, femoral, structure, due, to, their, omnivorous, diet, procyonids, have, lost, some, of, the, adaptations, for, flesh, eating, found, in, their, carnivorous, relatives, while, they, do, have, carnassial, teeth, these, are, poorly, developed, in, most, species, especially, the, raccoons, apart, from, the, kinkajou, procyonids, have, the, dental, formula, 3, 1, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2, for, a, total, of, 40, teeth, the, kinkajou, has, one, fewer, premolar, in, each, row, 3, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3, 2, for, a, total, of, 36, teeth, most, members, of, procyonidae, are, solitary, however, some, species, form, groups, coati, females, will, form, bands, of, 4, to, 24, individuals, that, forage, together, while, kinkajous, have, been, found, to, form, social, groups, of, two, males, and, one, female, certain, procyonids, give, birth, to, one, offspring, like, ringtails, olingos, and, kinkajous, while, raccoons, and, coatis, give, birth, to, litters, that, range, in, size, from, 2, to, 6, offspring, procyonid, fossils, once, believed, to, belong, to, the, genus, bassariscus, which, includes, the, modern, ringtail, and, cacomistle, have, been, identified, from, the, miocene, epoch, around, 20, million, years, ma, ago, it, has, been, suggested, that, early, procyonids, were, an, offshoot, of, the, canids, that, adapted, to, a, more, omnivorous, diet, the, recent, evolution, of, procyonids, has, been, centered, on, central, america, where, their, diversity, is, greatest, they, entered, the, formerly, isolated, south, america, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, beginning, about, 7, 3, ma, ago, in, the, late, miocene, with, the, appearance, of, cyonasua, some, fossil, procyonids, such, as, stromeriella, were, also, present, in, the, old, world, before, going, extinct, in, the, pliocene, genetic, studies, have, shown, that, kinkajous, are, a, sister, group, to, all, other, extant, procyonids, they, split, off, about, 22, 6, ma, ago, the, clades, leading, to, coatis, and, olingos, on, one, branch, and, to, ringtails, and, raccoons, on, the, other, separated, about, 17, 7, ma, ago, the, divergence, between, olingos, and, coatis, is, estimated, to, have, occurred, about, 10, 2, ma, ago, at, about, the, same, time, that, ringtails, and, raccoons, parted, ways, the, separation, between, coatis, and, mountain, coatis, is, estimated, to, have, occurred, 7, 7, ma, ago, there, has, been, considerable, historical, uncertainty, over, the, correct, classification, of, several, members, the, red, panda, was, previously, classified, in, this, family, but, it, is, now, classified, in, its, own, family, the, ailuridae, based, on, molecular, biology, studies, the, status, of, the, various, olingos, was, disputed, some, regarded, them, all, as, subspecies, of, bassaricyon, gabbii, before, dna, sequence, data, demonstrated, otherwise, the, traditional, classification, scheme, shown, below, on, the, left, predates, the, recent, revolution, in, our, understanding, of, procyonid, phylogeny, based, on, genetic, sequence, analysis, this, outdated, classification, groups, kinkajous, and, olingos, together, on, the, basis, of, similarities, in, morphology, that, are, now, known, to, be, an, example, of, parallel, evolution, similarly, coatis, are, shown, as, being, most, closely, related, to, raccoons, when, in, fact, they, are, closest, to, olingos, below, right, is, a, cladogram, showing, the, results, of, molecular, studies, as, of, 2013, genus, nasuella, was, not, included, in, these, studies, but, in, a, separate, study, was, found, to, nest, within, nasua, bassaricyon, olingos, and, olinguito, nasua, and, nasuella, coatis, procyon, raccoons, bassariscus, ringtail, and, cacomistle, potos, kinkajou, several, recent, molecular, studies, have, resolved, the, phylogenetic, relationships, between, the, procyonids, as, illustrated, in, the, cladogram, below, potos, flavus,
