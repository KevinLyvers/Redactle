solidago, commonly, called, goldenrods, is, a, genus, of, about, 100, to, 120, species, of, flowering, plants, in, the, family, asteraceae, most, are, herbaceous, perennial, species, found, in, open, areas, such, as, meadows, prairies, and, savannas, they, are, mostly, native, to, north, america, including, mexico, a, few, species, are, native, to, south, america, and, eurasia, some, american, species, have, also, been, introduced, into, europe, and, other, parts, of, the, world, solidago, species, are, perennials, growing, from, woody, caudices, or, rhizomes, their, stems, range, from, decumbent, crawling, to, ascending, or, erect, with, a, range, of, heights, going, from, 5, cm, 2, 0, in, to, over, a, meter, most, species, are, unbranched, but, some, do, display, branching, in, the, upper, part, of, the, plant, both, leaves, and, stems, vary, from, glabrous, hairless, to, various, forms, of, pubescence, strigose, strigillose, hispid, stipitate, glandular, or, villous, in, some, species, the, basal, leaves, are, shed, before, flowering, the, leaf, margins, are, most, commonly, entire, but, often, display, heavier, serration, some, leaves, may, display, trinerved, venation, rather, than, the, pinnate, venation, usual, across, asteraceae, the, flower, is, also, the, state, flower, of, kentucky, the, flower, heads, are, usually, of, the, radiate, type, typical, daisy, flower, heads, with, distinct, ray, and, disc, florets, but, sometimes, discoid, with, only, disc, florets, of, mixed, sterile, male, and, types, only, ray, florets, are, female, others, are, male, hermaphroditic, or, entire, sterile, head, involucres, are, campanulate, to, cylindric, or, attenuate, floret, corollas, are, usually, yellow, but, white, in, the, ray, florets, of, a, few, species, such, as, solidago, bicolor, they, are, typically, hairless, heads, usually, include, between, 2, and, 35, disc, florets, but, in, some, species, this, may, go, up, to, 60, filaments, are, inserted, closer, to, the, base, of, the, corolla, than, its, middle, numerous, heads, are, usually, grouped, in, complex, compound, inflorescences, where, heads, are, arranged, in, multiple, racemes, panicles, corymbs, or, secund, arrays, with, florets, all, on, the, same, side, solidago, cypselae, are, narrowly, obconic, to, cylindrical, in, shape, and, they, are, sometimes, somewhat, compressed, they, have, eight, to, 10, ribs, usually, and, are, hairless, or, moderately, hispid, the, pappus, is, very, big, with, barbellate, bristles, the, many, goldenrod, species, can, be, difficult, to, distinguish, due, to, their, similar, bright, golden, yellow, flower, heads, that, bloom, in, late, summer, propagation, is, by, wind, disseminated, seeds, or, by, spreading, underground, rhizomes, which, can, form, colonies, of, vegetative, clones, of, a, single, plant, they, are, mostly, short, day, plants, and, bloom, in, late, summer, and, early, fall, some, species, produce, abundant, nectar, when, moisture, is, plentiful, or, when, the, weather, is, warm, and, sunny, the, section, ptarmicoidei, is, sometimes, treated, as, a, separate, genus, oligoneuron, and, is, dropped, by, flat, topped, to, rounded, corymbiform, flowerheads, solidago, is, in, the, family, asteraceae, formerly, known, as, compositae, a, diverse, and, widespread, clade, containing, approximately, 23, 000, species, and, 12, tribes, which, inhabit, all, continents, except, antarctica, within, asteraceae, solidago, is, in, the, tribe, astereae, and, the, subtribe, solidagininaeae, the, genus, solidago, is, monophyletic, as, indicated, by, morphological, characters, and, molecular, evidence, all, solidago, species, are, herbaceous, perennials, growing, from, approximately, 2, cm, to, 2, 5, m, tall, yellow, to, white, pistillate, ray, flowers, and, yellow, perfect, disc, florets, are, characteristic, of, solidago, inflorescences, which, have, a, wide, range, of, shapes, molecular, studies, using, nuclear, rdna, have, hypothesized, boundaries, on, the, genus, solidago, but, there, have, been, difficulties, in, parsing, out, evolutionary, relationships, at, the, sub, genus, scale, and, defining, which, should, be, included, and, separated, from, solidago, related, asteraceae, genera, such, as, chrysoma, euthamia, and, oreochrysum, have, been, included, within, solidago, at, one, point, or, another, but, morphological, evidence, has, suggested, otherwise, in, a, study, comparing, morphological, characters, of, solidago, and, related, subgroups, the, authors, consider, the, subjectivity, of, classifying, a, genus, and, how, to, define, it, within, broader, tendencies, concerning, the, taxonomy, of, north, american, asteraceae, little, to, no, differences, were, observed, between, solidago, and, the, subgroups, in, terms, of, karyotype, however, external, morphological, characters, such, as, habit, or, the, general, appearance, of, the, plant, and, how, a, suite, of, traits, contribute, to, its, phenotype, pappus, size, and, the, point, of, freeing, of, stamen, filaments, from, the, corolla, tube, are, useful, classification, schemes, for, solidago, since, they, are, applied, to, differentiating, between, asteraceae, taxa, one, school, of, asteraceae, taxonomy, thought, unites, all, taxa, sharing, similar, floral, head, structure, and, subsequently, ignores, deviation, from, this, morphology, while, another, places, greater, weight, on, these, morphological, deviations, the, authors, argue, that, the, latter, opinion, should, be, applied, since, there, is, no, theoretical, foundation, for, relative, taxonomic, importance, of, traits, they, assert, that, habit, should, be, a, central, trait, when, defining, taxa, and, subsequently, that, all, the, subgroups, considered, in, their, study, brachychaeta, chrysoma, euthamia, oligoneuron, and, petradoria, should, be, segregated, from, solidago, results, from, a, leaf, anatomy, study, comparing, differences, in, mesophyll, bundle, sheath, extensions, and, midvein, structure, among, others, in, a, suite, of, leaf, traits, are, incongruent, with, those, in, an, earlier, study, based, on, the, lack, of, bundle, sheath, extensions, it, is, suggested, that, chrysoma, euthamia, gundlachia, and, petradoria, should, be, distinct, taxa, and, outside, of, solidago, however, brachychaeta, brintonia, oligoneuron, oreochrysum, and, aster, should, be, considered, as, components, of, solidago, to, summarize, the, relation, of, brachychaeta, and, oligoneuron, to, solidago, is, inconsistent, based, on, these, results, both, support, the, separation, of, chrysoma, euthamia, and, petradoria, from, solidago, a, study, reviews, the, taxonomic, position, of, oligoneuron, relative, to, solidago, as, based, on, taxonomic, evidence, treats, it, as, separate, from, solidago, similarly, to, kapoor, beaudry, 1966, the, first, molecular, phylogeny, based, on, chloroplast, dna, treats, brachychaeta, brintonia, oligoneuron, and, oreochrysum, as, constituents, of, solidago, using, consensus, trees, from, its, data, another, study, found, support, for, oligoneuron, as, part, of, solidago, and, the, findings, of, zhang, 1996, more, recently, an, analysis, of, combined, its, and, ets, data, provided, additional, support, for, the, inclusion, of, oligoneuron, as, part, of, solidago, until, the, 1980s, the, genus, euthamia, was, largely, considered, to, be, a, part, of, solidago, due, to, morphological, similarities, between, species, in, both, genera, and, a, history, of, synonymy, of, solidago, lanceolata, and, euthamia, graminifolia, as, mentioned, the, lack, of, bundle, sheath, extensions, in, euthamia, compared, to, solidago, and, deviations, in, floral, morphology, present, evidence, for, separation, of, these, taxa, a, taxonomy, of, euthamia, as, a, genus, was, presented, providing, a, detailed, description, of, distinguishing, external, morphological, characters, such, as, fibrous, roots, sessile, leaves, and, mostly, corymbiform, inflorescences, chromosome, counts, and, advances, in, molecular, systematics, have, enabled, greater, understanding, of, evolutionary, relationships, within, solidago, at, the, time, a, taxonomy, of, solidago, was, published, related, taxa, causing, contention, such, as, chrysoma, euthamia, oligoneuron, and, petradoria, were, excluded, from, this, genus, the, number, of, solidago, species, has, remained, relatively, stable, around, 120, with, approximately, 80, in, north, america, due, to, monophyletic, support, for, the, new, world, taxa, and, taxonomic, difficulties, with, old, world, taxa, the, taxonomy, provided, in, the, 1990s, only, includes, north, american, taxa, and, thus, treats, solidago, as, non, monophyletic, existing, molecular, based, phylogenies, provide, monophyletic, support, for, solidago, given, its, inclusion, of, oligoneuron, chromosome, counts, have, proven, to, be, a, valuable, character, in, solidago, taxonomy, and, in, elucidating, the, cytogeographic, history, of, the, genus, similar, chromosome, counts, may, indicate, close, evolutionary, relationships, while, different, chromosome, numbers, may, suggest, distant, relationships, through, reproductive, isolation, chromosome, counts, have, been, studied, extensively, in, north, america, all, solidago, species, have, a, base, chromosome, number, of, x, 9, but, the, following, ploidy, levels, have, been, observed, 2x, 3x, 4x, 6x, 8x, 10x, 12x, and, 14x, though, negligible, differences, in, karyotype, among, solidago, and, related, genera, were, found, solidago, taxa, with, multiple, cytotypes, are, more, common, than, those, with, one, although, chromosome, count, is, a, useful, metric, for, differentiating, among, solidago, taxa, it, may, be, problematic, due, to, the, frequent, variation, in, ploidy, levels, cytogeographic, patterns, in, the, solidago, gigantea, complex, with, tetraploids, occurring, in, eastern, north, america, and, hexaploids, in, oregon, and, washington, were, observed, cytogeographic, patterns, are, also, observed, in, the, solidago, canadensis, complex, hexaploids, within, s, canadensis, have, been, observed, east, of, the, great, plains, and, are, treated, as, solidago, altissima, and, diploids, and, tetraploids, occurring, in, the, great, plains, are, treated, as, solidago, gilvocanescens, the, taxonomic, status, of, solidago, ptarmicoides, created, an, extensive, debate, due, to, frequency, hybridization, of, s, ptarmicoides, with, members, of, the, ptarmicoidei, section, of, solidago, it, was, asserted, that, s, ptarmicoides, should, be, united, with, solidago, rather, than, the, genus, aster, due, to, external, morphological, features, such, as, similar, pappus, length, as, well, as, the, same, chromosome, base, x, 9, information, about, chromosome, number, is, still, a, crucial, part, of, current, understanding, and, phylogenies, of, solidago, goldenrod, is, considered, a, keystone, species, and, has, been, called, the, single, most, important, plant, for, north, american, pollinator, biodiversity, goldenrod, species, are, used, as, a, food, source, by, the, larvae, of, many, lepidoptera, species, as, many, as, 104, species, of, butterflies, and, moths, use, it, as, a, host, plant, for, their, larvae, and, 42, species, of, bees, are, goldenrod, specialists, visiting, only, goldenrod, for, food, some, lepidopteran, larvae, bore, into, plant, tissues, and, form, a, bulbous, tissue, mass, called, a, gall, around, it, upon, which, the, larva, then, feeds, various, parasitoid, wasps, find, these, galls, and, lay, eggs, in, the, larvae, penetrating, the, bulb, with, their, ovipositors, woodpeckers, are, known, to, peck, open, the, galls, and, eat, the, insects, in, the, center, goldenrods, have, become, invasive, species, in, many, parts, of, the, world, outside, their, native, range, including, china, japan, europe, and, africa, solidago, canadensis, which, was, introduced, as, a, garden, plant, in, central, europe, has, become, common, in, the, wild, and, in, germany, is, considered, an, invasive, species, that, displaces, native, vegetation, from, its, natural, habitat, young, goldenrod, leaves, are, edible, traditionally, native, americans, use, the, seeds, of, some, species, for, food, herbal, teas, are, sometimes, made, with, goldenrod, goldenrod, often, is, inaccurately, said, to, cause, hay, fever, in, humans, the, pollen, causing, this, allergic, reaction, is, produced, mainly, by, ragweed, ambrosia, sp, blooming, at, the, same, time, as, the, goldenrod, and, pollinated, by, wind, goldenrod, pollen, is, too, heavy, and, sticky, to, be, blown, far, from, the, flowers, and, is, pollinated, mainly, by, insects, frequent, handling, of, goldenrod, and, other, flowers, however, can, cause, allergic, reactions, sometimes, irritating, enough, to, force, florists, to, change, occupation, goldenrods, are, attractive, sources, of, nectar, for, bees, flies, wasps, and, butterflies, honey, from, goldenrods, often, is, dark, and, strong, because, of, admixtures, of, other, nectars, however, when, honey, flow, is, strong, a, light, often, water, clear, spicy, tasting, monofloral, honey, is, produced, while, the, bees, are, ripening, the, honey, produced, from, goldenrods, it, has, a, rank, odour, and, taste, the, finished, honey, is, much, milder, goldenrods, are, in, some, places, considered, a, sign, of, good, luck, or, good, fortune, they, are, considered, weeds, by, many, in, north, america, but, they, are, seen, as, invasive, plants, in, europe, where, british, gardeners, adopted, goldenrod, as, a, garden, subject, goldenrod, began, to, gain, some, acceptance, in, u, s, gardening, other, than, wildflower, gardening, during, the, 1980s, cultivated, goldenrods, include, s, bicolor, s, caesia, s, canadensis, s, cutleri, s, riddellii, s, rigida, s, shortii, and, s, virgaurea, a, number, of, cultivars, have, been, selected, including, several, of, hybrid, origin, a, putative, hybrid, with, aster, known, as, solidaster, is, less, unruly, with, pale, yellow, flowers, equally, suitable, for, dried, arrangements, molecular, and, other, evidence, points, to, solidaster, at, least, the, cultivar, lemore, being, a, hybrid, of, solidago, ptarmicoides, and, solidago, canadensis, the, former, now, in, solidago, but, likely, the, aster, in, question, the, cultivars, goldenmosa, and, s, luteus, lemore, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, inventor, thomas, edison, experimented, with, goldenrod, to, produce, rubber, which, it, contains, naturally, edison, created, a, fertilization, and, cultivation, process, to, maximize, the, rubber, content, in, each, plant, his, experiments, produced, a, 12, ft, tall, 3, 7, m, plant, that, yielded, as, much, as, 12, rubber, the, tires, on, the, model, t, given, to, him, by, his, friend, henry, ford, were, made, from, goldenrod, like, george, washington, carver, henry, ford, was, deeply, interested, in, the, regenerative, properties, of, soil, and, the, potential, of, alternative, crops, such, as, peanuts, and, soybeans, to, produce, plastics, paint, fuel, and, other, products, ford, had, long, believed, that, the, world, would, eventually, need, a, substitute, for, gasoline, and, supported, the, production, of, ethanol, or, grain, alcohol, as, an, alternative, fuel, in, 1942, he, would, showcase, a, car, with, a, lightweight, plastic, body, made, from, soybeans, ford, and, carver, began, corresponding, via, letter, in, 1934, and, their, mutual, admiration, deepened, after, george, washington, carver, made, a, visit, to, michigan, in, 1937, as, douglas, brinkley, writes, in, wheels, for, the, world, his, history, of, ford, the, automaker, donated, generously, to, the, tuskegee, institute, helping, finance, carver, s, experiments, and, carver, in, turn, spent, a, period, of, time, helping, to, oversee, crops, at, the, ford, plantation, in, ways, georgia, by, the, time, world, war, ii, began, ford, had, made, repeated, journeys, to, tuskegee, to, convince, george, washington, carver, to, come, to, dearborn, and, help, him, develop, a, synthetic, rubber, to, help, compensate, for, wartime, rubber, shortages, carver, arrived, on, july, 19, 1942, and, set, up, a, laboratory, in, an, old, water, works, building, in, dearborn, he, and, ford, experimented, with, different, crops, including, sweet, potatoes, and, dandelions, eventually, devising, a, way, to, make, the, rubber, substitute, from, goldenrod, a, plant, weed, commercially, viable, carver, died, in, january, 1943, ford, in, april, 1947, but, the, relationship, between, their, two, institutions, continued, to, flourish, as, recently, as, the, late, 1990s, ford, awarded, grants, of, 4, million, over, two, years, to, the, george, washington, carver, school, at, tuskegee, extensive, process, development, was, conducted, during, world, war, ii, to, commercialize, goldenrod, as, a, source, of, rubber, the, rubber, is, only, contained, in, the, leaves, not, the, stems, or, blooms, typical, rubber, content, of, the, leaves, is, 7, the, resulting, rubber, is, of, low, molecular, weight, resulting, in, an, excessively, tacky, compound, with, poor, tensile, properties, solidago, virgaurea, is, used, in, a, traditional, kidney, tonic, by, practitioners, of, herbal, medicine, to, counter, inflammation, and, irritation, caused, by, bacterial, infections, or, kidney, stones, goldenrod, is, also, used, in, some, formulas, for, cleansing, of, the, kidney, or, bladder, during, a, healing, fast, in, conjunction, with, potassium, broth, and, specific, juices, some, native, american, cultures, traditionally, chew, the, leaves, to, relieve, sore, throats, and, the, roots, to, relieve, toothaches, in, various, assessments, by, the, european, medicines, agency, with, respect, to, solidago, virgaurea, non, clinical, data, shows, diuretic, anti, inflammatory, antioxidant, analgesic, and, spasmolytic, antibacterial, antifungal, anticancer, and, immunomodulatory, activity, however, as, no, single, ingredient, is, responsible, for, these, effects, the, whole, herbal, preparation, of, solidago, inflorescences, must, be, considered, as, the, active, ingredient, the, goldenrod, is, the, state, flower, of, the, u, s, states, of, kentucky, adopted, 1926, and, nebraska, adopted, 1895, solidago, altissima, tall, goldenrod, was, named, the, state, wildflower, of, south, carolina, in, 2003, the, sweet, goldenrod, solidago, odora, is, the, state, herb, of, delaware, goldenrod, was, the, state, flower, of, alabama, but, it, was, later, rejected, in, favor, of, the, camellia, source, numerous, species, formerly, considered, members, of, solidago, are, now, regarded, as, better, suited, to, other, genera, including, brintonia, duhaldea, euthamia, gundlachia, inula, jacobaea, leptostelma, olearia, psiadia, senecio, sphagneticola, symphyotrichum, and, trixis
