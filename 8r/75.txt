a, muscle, cell, also, known, as, a, myocyte, is, a, mature, contractile, cell, in, the, muscle, of, an, animal, in, humans, and, other, vertebrates, there, are, three, types, skeletal, smooth, and, cardiac, cardiomyocytes, a, skeletal, muscle, cell, is, long, and, threadlike, with, many, nuclei, and, is, called, a, muscle, fiber, muscle, cells, develop, from, embryonic, precursor, cells, called, myoblasts, skeletal, muscle, cells, form, by, fusion, of, myoblasts, to, produce, multinucleated, cells, syncytia, in, a, process, known, as, myogenesis, skeletal, muscle, cells, and, cardiac, muscle, cells, both, contain, myofibrils, and, sarcomeres, and, form, a, striated, muscle, tissue, cardiac, muscle, cells, form, the, cardiac, muscle, in, the, walls, of, the, heart, chambers, and, have, a, single, central, nucleus, cardiac, muscle, cells, are, joined, to, neighboring, cells, by, intercalated, discs, and, when, joined, in, a, visible, unit, they, are, described, as, a, cardiac, muscle, fiber, smooth, muscle, cells, control, involuntary, movements, such, as, the, peristalsis, contractions, in, the, esophagus, and, stomach, smooth, muscle, has, no, myofibrils, or, sarcomeres, and, is, therefore, non, striated, smooth, muscle, cells, have, a, single, nucleus, the, unusual, microscopic, anatomy, of, a, muscle, cell, gave, rise, to, its, terminology, the, cytoplasm, in, a, muscle, cell, is, termed, the, sarcoplasm, the, smooth, endoplasmic, reticulum, of, a, muscle, cell, is, termed, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, and, the, cell, membrane, in, a, muscle, cell, is, termed, the, sarcolemma, the, sarcolemma, receives, and, conducts, stimuli, skeletal, muscle, cells, are, the, individual, contractile, cells, within, a, muscle, and, are, more, usually, known, as, muscle, fibers, because, of, their, longer, threadlike, appearance, broadly, there, are, two, types, of, muscle, fiber, performing, in, muscle, contraction, either, as, slow, twitch, type, i, or, fast, twitch, type, ii, a, single, muscle, such, as, the, biceps, brachii, in, a, young, adult, human, male, contains, around, 253, 000, muscle, fibers, skeletal, muscle, fibers, are, the, only, muscle, cells, that, are, multinucleated, with, the, nuclei, usually, referred, to, as, myonuclei, this, occurs, during, myogenesis, with, the, fusion, of, myoblasts, each, contributing, a, nucleus, to, the, newly, formed, muscle, cell, or, myotube, fusion, depends, on, muscle, specific, proteins, known, as, fusogens, called, myomaker, and, myomerger, a, striated, muscle, fiber, contains, myofibrils, consisting, of, long, protein, chains, of, myofilaments, there, are, three, types, of, myofilaments, thin, thick, and, elastic, that, work, together, to, produce, a, muscle, contraction, the, thin, myofilaments, are, filaments, of, mostly, actin, and, the, thick, filaments, are, of, mostly, myosin, and, they, slide, over, each, other, to, shorten, the, fiber, length, in, a, muscle, contraction, the, third, type, of, myofilament, is, an, elastic, filament, composed, of, titin, a, very, large, protein, in, striations, of, muscle, bands, myosin, forms, the, dark, filaments, that, make, up, the, a, band, thin, filaments, of, actin, are, the, light, filaments, that, make, up, the, i, band, the, smallest, contractile, unit, in, the, fiber, is, called, the, sarcomere, which, is, a, repeating, unit, within, two, z, bands, the, sarcoplasm, also, contains, glycogen, which, provides, energy, to, the, cell, during, heightened, exercise, and, myoglobin, the, red, pigment, that, stores, oxygen, until, needed, for, muscular, activity, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, a, specialized, type, of, smooth, endoplasmic, reticulum, forms, a, network, around, each, myofibril, of, the, muscle, fiber, this, network, is, composed, of, groupings, of, two, dilated, end, sacs, called, terminal, cisternae, and, a, single, t, tubule, transverse, tubule, which, bores, through, the, cell, and, emerge, on, the, other, side, together, these, three, components, form, the, triads, that, exist, within, the, network, of, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, in, which, each, t, tubule, has, two, terminal, cisternae, on, each, side, of, it, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, serves, as, a, reservoir, for, calcium, ions, so, when, an, action, potential, spreads, over, the, t, tubule, it, signals, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, to, release, calcium, ions, from, the, gated, membrane, channels, to, stimulate, muscle, contraction, in, skeletal, muscle, at, the, end, of, each, muscle, fiber, the, outer, layer, of, the, sarcolemma, combines, with, tendon, fibers, at, the, myotendinous, junction, within, the, muscle, fiber, pressed, against, the, sarcolemma, are, multiply, flattened, nuclei, embryologically, this, multinucleate, condition, results, from, multiple, myoblasts, fusing, to, produce, each, muscle, fiber, where, each, myoblast, contributes, one, nucleus, the, cell, membrane, of, a, cardiac, muscle, cell, has, several, specialized, regions, which, may, include, the, intercalated, disc, and, transverse, tubules, the, cell, membrane, is, covered, by, a, lamina, coat, which, is, approximately, 50, nm, wide, the, laminar, coat, is, separable, into, two, layers, the, lamina, densa, and, lamina, lucida, in, between, these, two, layers, can, be, several, different, types, of, ions, including, calcium, cardiac, muscle, like, the, skeletal, muscle, is, also, striated, and, the, cells, contain, myofibrils, myofilaments, and, sarcomeres, as, the, skeletal, muscle, cell, the, cell, membrane, is, anchored, to, the, cell, s, cytoskeleton, by, anchor, fibers, that, are, approximately, 10, nm, wide, these, are, generally, located, at, the, z, lines, so, that, they, form, grooves, and, transverse, tubules, emanate, in, cardiac, myocytes, this, forms, a, scalloped, surface, the, cytoskeleton, is, what, the, rest, of, the, cell, builds, off, of, and, has, two, primary, purposes, the, first, is, to, stabilize, the, topography, of, the, intracellular, components, and, the, second, is, to, help, control, the, size, and, shape, of, the, cell, while, the, first, function, is, important, for, biochemical, processes, the, latter, is, crucial, in, defining, the, surface, to, volume, ratio, of, the, cell, this, heavily, influences, the, potential, electrical, properties, of, excitable, cells, additionally, deviation, from, the, standard, shape, and, size, of, the, cell, can, have, a, negative, prognostic, impact, smooth, muscle, cells, are, so, called, because, they, have, neither, myofibrils, nor, sarcomeres, and, therefore, no, striations, they, are, found, in, the, walls, of, hollow, organs, including, the, stomach, intestines, bladder, and, uterus, in, the, walls, of, blood, vessels, and, in, the, tracts, of, the, respiratory, urinary, and, reproductive, systems, in, the, eyes, the, ciliary, muscles, dilate, and, contract, the, iris, and, alter, the, shape, of, the, lens, in, the, skin, smooth, muscle, cells, such, as, those, of, the, arrector, pili, cause, hair, to, stand, erect, in, response, to, cold, temperature, or, fear, smooth, muscle, cells, are, spindle, shaped, with, wide, middles, and, tapering, ends, they, have, a, single, nucleus, and, range, from, 30, to, 200, micrometers, in, length, this, is, thousands, of, times, shorter, than, skeletal, muscle, fibers, the, diameter, of, their, cells, is, also, much, smaller, which, removes, the, need, for, t, tubules, found, in, striated, muscle, cells, although, smooth, muscle, cells, lack, sarcomeres, and, myofibrils, they, do, contain, large, amounts, of, the, contractile, proteins, actin, and, myosin, actin, filaments, are, anchored, by, dense, bodies, similar, to, the, z, discs, in, sarcomeres, to, the, sarcolemma, a, myoblast, is, an, embryonic, precursor, cell, that, differentiates, to, give, rise, to, the, different, muscle, cell, types, differentiation, is, regulated, by, myogenic, regulatory, factors, including, myod, myf5, myogenin, and, mrf4, gata4, and, gata6, also, play, a, role, in, myocyte, differentiation, skeletal, muscle, fibers, are, made, when, myoblasts, fuse, together, muscle, fibers, therefore, are, cells, with, multiple, nuclei, known, as, myonuclei, with, each, cell, nucleus, originating, from, a, single, myoblast, the, fusion, of, myoblasts, is, specific, to, skeletal, muscle, and, not, cardiac, muscle, or, smooth, muscle, myoblasts, in, skeletal, muscle, that, do, not, form, muscle, fibers, dedifferentiate, back, into, myosatellite, cells, these, satellite, cells, remain, adjacent, to, a, skeletal, muscle, fiber, situated, between, the, sarcolemma, and, the, basement, membrane, of, the, endomysium, the, connective, tissue, investment, that, divides, the, muscle, fascicles, into, individual, fibers, to, re, activate, myogenesis, the, satellite, cells, must, be, stimulated, to, differentiate, into, new, fibers, myoblasts, and, their, derivatives, including, satellite, cells, can, now, be, generated, in, vitro, through, directed, differentiation, of, pluripotent, stem, cells, kindlin, 2, plays, a, role, in, developmental, elongation, during, myogenesis, when, contracting, thin, and, thick, filaments, slide, concerning, each, other, by, using, adenosine, triphosphate, this, pulls, the, z, discs, closer, together, in, a, process, called, the, sliding, filament, mechanism, the, contraction, of, all, the, sarcomeres, results, in, the, contraction, of, the, whole, muscle, fiber, this, contraction, of, the, myocyte, is, triggered, by, the, action, potential, over, the, cell, membrane, of, the, myocyte, the, action, potential, uses, transverse, tubules, to, get, from, the, surface, to, the, interior, of, the, myocyte, which, is, continuous, within, the, cell, membrane, sarcoplasmic, reticula, are, membranous, bags, that, transverse, tubules, touch, but, remain, separate, from, these, wrap, themselves, around, each, sarcomere, and, are, filled, with, ca, 2, excitation, of, a, myocyte, causes, depolarization, at, its, synapses, the, neuromuscular, junctions, which, triggers, an, action, potential, with, a, singular, neuromuscular, junction, each, muscle, fiber, receives, input, from, just, one, somatic, efferent, neuron, action, potential, in, a, somatic, efferent, neuron, causes, the, release, of, the, neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, when, the, acetylcholine, is, released, it, diffuses, across, the, synapse, and, binds, to, a, receptor, on, the, sarcolemma, a, term, unique, to, muscle, cells, that, refers, to, the, cell, membrane, this, initiates, an, impulse, that, travels, across, the, sarcolemma, when, the, action, potential, reaches, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, it, triggers, the, release, of, ca, 2, from, the, ca, 2, channels, the, ca, 2, flows, from, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, into, the, sarcomere, with, both, of, its, filaments, this, causes, the, filaments, to, start, sliding, and, the, sarcomeres, to, become, shorter, this, requires, a, large, amount, of, atp, as, it, is, used, in, both, the, attachment, and, release, of, every, myosin, head, very, quickly, ca, 2, is, actively, transported, back, into, the, sarcoplasmic, reticulum, which, blocks, the, interaction, between, the, thin, and, thick, filament, this, in, turn, causes, the, muscle, cell, to, relax, there, are, four, main, types, of, muscle, contraction, isometric, isotonic, eccentric, and, concentric, isometric, contractions, are, skeletal, muscle, contractions, that, do, not, cause, movement, of, the, muscle, and, isotonic, contractions, are, skeletal, muscle, contractions, that, do, cause, movement, eccentric, contraction, is, when, a, muscle, moves, under, a, load, concentric, contraction, is, when, a, muscle, shortens, and, generates, force, specialized, cardiomyocytes, in, the, sinoatrial, node, generate, electrical, impulses, that, control, the, heart, rate, these, electrical, impulses, coordinate, contraction, throughout, the, remaining, heart, muscle, via, the, electrical, conduction, system, of, the, heart, sinoatrial, node, activity, is, modulated, in, turn, by, nerve, fibers, of, both, the, sympathetic, and, parasympathetic, nervous, systems, these, systems, act, to, increase, and, decrease, respectively, the, rate, of, production, of, electrical, impulses, by, the, sinoatrial, node, the, evolutionary, origin, of, muscle, cells, in, animals, is, highly, debated, one, view, is, that, muscle, cells, evolved, once, and, thus, all, muscle, cells, have, a, single, common, ancestor, another, view, is, that, muscles, cells, evolved, more, than, once, and, any, morphological, or, structural, similarities, are, due, to, convergent, evolution, and, the, development, of, shared, genes, that, predate, the, evolution, of, muscle, even, the, mesoderm, the, mesoderm, is, the, germ, layer, that, gives, rise, to, muscle, cells, in, vertebrates, schmid, seipel, 2005, argue, that, the, origin, of, muscle, cells, is, a, monophyletic, trait, that, occurred, concurrently, with, the, development, of, the, digestive, and, nervous, systems, of, all, animals, and, that, this, origin, can, be, traced, to, a, single, metazoan, ancestor, in, which, muscle, cells, are, present, they, argue, that, molecular, and, morphological, similarities, between, the, muscles, cells, in, cnidaria, and, ctenophora, are, similar, enough, to, those, of, bilaterians, that, there, would, be, one, ancestor, in, metazoans, from, which, muscle, cells, derive, in, this, case, schmid, seipel, argue, that, the, last, common, ancestor, of, bilateria, ctenophora, and, cnidaria, was, a, triploblast, an, organism, having, three, germ, layers, and, that, diploblasty, meaning, an, organism, with, two, germ, layers, evolved, secondarily, because, of, their, observation, of, the, lack, of, mesoderm, or, muscle, found, in, most, cnidarians, and, ctenophores, by, comparing, the, morphology, of, cnidarians, and, ctenophores, to, bilaterians, schmid, seipel, were, able, to, conclude, that, there, were, myoblast, like, structures, in, the, tentacles, and, gut, of, some, species, of, cnidarians, and, the, tentacles, of, ctenophores, since, this, is, a, structure, unique, to, muscle, cells, these, scientists, determined, based, on, the, data, collected, by, their, peers, that, this, is, a, marker, for, striated, muscles, similar, to, that, observed, in, bilaterians, the, authors, also, remark, that, the, muscle, cells, found, in, cnidarians, and, ctenophores, are, often, contested, due, to, the, origin, of, these, muscle, cells, being, the, ectoderm, rather, than, the, mesoderm, or, mesendoderm, the, origin, of, true, muscle, cells, is, argued, by, other, authors, to, be, the, endoderm, portion, of, the, mesoderm, and, the, endoderm, however, schmid, seipel, 2005, counter, skepticism, about, whether, the, muscle, cells, found, in, ctenophores, and, cnidarians, are, true, muscle, cells, by, considering, that, cnidarians, develop, through, a, medusa, stage, and, polyp, stage, they, note, that, in, the, hydrozoans, medusa, stage, there, is, a, layer, of, cells, that, separate, from, the, distal, side, of, the, ectoderm, which, forms, the, striated, muscle, cells, in, a, way, similar, to, that, of, the, mesoderm, they, call, this, third, separated, layer, of, cells, the, ectocodon, schmid, seipel, argue, that, even, in, bilaterians, not, all, muscle, cells, are, derived, from, the, mesendoderm, their, key, examples, are, that, in, both, the, eye, muscles, of, vertebrates, and, the, muscles, of, spiralians, these, cells, derive, from, the, ectodermal, mesoderm, rather, than, the, endodermal, mesoderm, furthermore, they, argue, that, since, myogenesis, does, occur, in, cnidarians, with, the, help, of, the, same, molecular, regulatory, elements, found, in, the, specification, of, muscle, cells, in, bilaterians, that, there, is, evidence, for, a, single, origin, for, striated, muscle, in, contrast, to, this, argument, for, a, single, origin, of, muscle, cells, steinmetz, kraus, et, al, 2012, argue, that, molecular, markers, such, as, the, myosin, ii, protein, used, to, determine, this, single, origin, of, striated, muscle, predate, the, formation, of, muscle, cells, they, use, an, example, of, the, contractile, elements, present, in, the, porifera, or, sponges, that, do, truly, lack, this, striated, muscle, containing, this, protein, furthermore, steinmetz, kraus, et, al, present, evidence, for, a, polyphyletic, origin, of, striated, muscle, cell, development, through, their, analysis, of, morphological, and, molecular, markers, that, are, present, in, bilaterians, and, absent, in, cnidarians, ctenophores, and, bilaterians, steinmetz, kraus, et, al, showed, that, the, traditional, morphological, and, regulatory, markers, such, as, actin, the, ability, to, couple, myosin, side, chains, phosphorylation, to, higher, concentrations, of, the, positive, concentrations, of, calcium, and, other, myhc, elements, are, present, in, all, metazoans, not, just, the, organisms, that, have, been, shown, to, have, muscle, cells, thus, the, usage, of, any, of, these, structural, or, regulatory, elements, in, determining, whether, or, not, the, muscle, cells, of, the, cnidarians, and, ctenophores, are, similar, enough, to, the, muscle, cells, of, the, bilaterians, to, confirm, a, single, lineage, is, questionable, according, to, steinmetz, kraus, et, al, furthermore, they, explain, that, the, orthologues, of, the, myc, genes, that, have, been, used, to, hypothesize, the, origin, of, striated, muscle, occurred, through, a, gene, duplication, event, that, predates, the, first, true, muscle, cells, meaning, striated, muscle, and, they, show, that, the, myc, genes, are, present, in, the, sponges, that, have, contractile, elements, but, no, true, muscle, cells, steinmetz, kraus, et, al, also, showed, that, the, localization, of, this, duplicated, set, of, genes, that, serve, both, the, function, of, facilitating, the, formation, of, striated, muscle, genes, and, cell, regulation, and, movement, genes, were, already, separated, into, striated, much, and, non, muscle, mhc, this, separation, of, the, duplicated, set, of, genes, is, shown, through, the, localization, of, the, striated, much, to, the, contractile, vacuole, in, sponges, while, the, non, muscle, much, was, more, diffusely, expressed, during, developmental, cell, shape, and, change, steinmetz, kraus, et, al, found, a, similar, pattern, of, localization, in, cnidarians, except, with, the, cnidarian, n, vectensis, having, this, striated, muscle, marker, present, in, the, smooth, muscle, of, the, digestive, tract, thus, they, argue, that, the, pleisiomorphic, trait, of, the, separated, orthologues, of, much, cannot, be, used, to, determine, the, monophylogeny, of, muscle, and, additionally, argue, that, the, presence, of, a, striated, muscle, marker, in, the, smooth, muscle, of, this, cnidarian, shows, a, fundamental, different, mechanism, of, muscle, cell, development, and, structure, in, cnidarians, steinmetz, kraus, et, al, 2012, further, argue, for, multiple, origins, of, striated, muscle, in, the, metazoans, by, explaining, that, a, key, set, of, genes, used, to, form, the, troponin, complex, for, muscle, regulation, and, formation, in, bilaterians, is, missing, from, the, cnidarians, and, ctenophores, and, 47, structural, and, regulatory, proteins, observed, steinmetz, kraus, et, al, were, not, able, to, find, even, on, unique, striated, muscle, cell, protein, that, was, expressed, in, both, cnidarians, and, bilaterians, furthermore, the, z, disc, seemed, to, have, evolved, differently, even, within, bilaterians, and, there, is, a, great, deal, of, diversity, of, proteins, developed, even, between, this, clade, showing, a, large, degree, of, radiation, for, muscle, cells, through, this, divergence, of, the, z, disc, steinmetz, kraus, et, al, argue, that, there, are, only, four, common, protein, components, that, were, present, in, all, bilaterians, muscle, ancestors, and, that, of, these, for, necessary, z, disc, components, only, an, actin, protein, that, they, have, already, argued, is, an, uninformative, marker, through, its, pleisiomorphic, state, is, present, in, cnidarians, through, further, molecular, marker, testing, steinmetz, et, al, observe, that, non, bilaterians, lack, many, regulatory, and, structural, components, necessary, for, bilaterians, muscle, formation, and, do, not, find, any, unique, set, of, proteins, to, both, bilaterians, and, cnidarians, and, ctenophores, that, are, not, present, in, earlier, more, primitive, animals, such, as, the, sponges, and, amoebozoans, through, this, analysis, the, authors, conclude, that, due, to, the, lack, of, elements, that, bilaterian, muscles, are, dependent, on, for, structure, and, usage, nonbilaterian, muscles, must, be, of, a, different, origin, with, a, different, set, of, regulatory, and, structural, proteins, in, another, take, on, the, argument, andrikou, arnone, 2015, use, the, newly, available, data, on, gene, regulatory, networks, to, look, at, how, the, hierarchy, of, genes, and, morphogens, and, another, mechanism, of, tissue, specification, diverge, and, are, similar, among, early, deuterostomes, and, protostomes, by, understanding, not, only, what, genes, are, present, in, all, bilaterians, but, also, the, time, and, place, of, deployment, of, these, genes, andrikou, arnone, discuss, a, deeper, understanding, of, the, evolution, of, myogenesis, in, their, paper, andrikou, arnone, 2015, argue, that, to, truly, understand, the, evolution, of, muscle, cells, the, function, of, transcriptional, regulators, must, be, understood, in, the, context, of, other, external, and, internal, interactions, through, their, analysis, andrikou, arnone, found, that, there, were, conserved, orthologues, of, the, gene, regulatory, network, in, both, invertebrate, bilaterians, and, cnidarians, they, argue, that, having, this, common, general, regulatory, circuit, allowed, for, a, high, degree, of, divergence, from, a, single, well, functioning, network, andrikou, arnone, found, that, the, orthologues, of, genes, found, in, vertebrates, had, been, changed, through, different, types, of, structural, mutations, in, the, invertebrate, deuterostomes, and, protostomes, and, they, argue, that, these, structural, changes, in, the, genes, allowed, for, a, large, divergence, of, muscle, function, and, muscle, formation, in, these, species, andrikou, arnone, were, able, to, recognize, not, only, any, difference, due, to, mutation, in, the, genes, found, in, vertebrates, and, invertebrates, but, also, the, integration, of, species, specific, genes, that, could, also, cause, divergence, from, the, original, gene, regulatory, network, function, thus, although, a, common, muscle, patterning, system, has, been, determined, they, argue, that, this, could, be, due, to, a, more, ancestral, gene, regulatory, network, being, coopted, several, times, across, lineages, with, additional, genes, and, mutations, causing, very, divergent, development, of, muscles, thus, it, seems, that, the, myogenic, patterning, framework, may, be, an, ancestral, trait, however, andrikou, arnone, explain, that, the, basic, muscle, patterning, structure, must, also, be, considered, in, combination, with, the, cis, regulatory, elements, present, at, different, times, during, development, in, contrast, with, the, high, level, of, gene, family, apparatuses, structure, andrikou, and, arnone, found, that, the, cis, regulatory, elements, were, not, well, conserved, both, in, time, and, place, in, the, network, which, could, show, a, large, degree, of, divergence, in, the, formation, of, muscle, cells, through, this, analysis, it, seems, that, the, myogenic, grn, is, an, ancestral, grn, with, actual, changes, in, myogenic, function, and, structure, possibly, being, linked, to, later, coopts, of, genes, at, different, times, and, places, evolutionarily, specialized, forms, of, skeletal, and, cardiac, muscles, predated, the, divergence, of, the, vertebrate, arthropod, evolutionary, line, this, indicates, that, these, types, of, muscle, developed, in, a, common, ancestor, sometime, before, 700, million, years, ago, mya, vertebrate, smooth, muscle, was, found, to, have, evolved, independently, from, the, skeletal, and, cardiac, muscle, types, the, properties, used, for, distinguishing, fast, intermediate, and, slow, muscle, fibers, can, be, different, for, invertebrate, flight, and, jump, muscle, to, further, complicate, this, classification, scheme, the, mitochondrial, content, and, other, morphological, properties, within, a, muscle, fiber, can, change, in, a, tsetse, fly, with, exercise, and, age
