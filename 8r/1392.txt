in, biology, a, pathogen, greek, pathos, suffering, passion, and, gen, s, producer, of, in, the, oldest, and, broadest, sense, is, any, organism, or, agent, that, can, produce, disease, a, pathogen, may, also, be, referred, to, as, an, infectious, agent, or, simply, a, germ, the, term, pathogen, came, into, use, in, the, 1880s, typically, the, term, pathogen, is, used, to, describe, an, infectious, microorganism, or, agent, such, as, a, virus, bacterium, protozoan, prion, viroid, or, fungus, small, animals, such, as, helminths, and, insects, can, also, cause, or, transmit, disease, however, these, animals, are, usually, referred, to, as, parasites, rather, than, pathogens, the, scientific, study, of, microscopic, organisms, including, microscopic, pathogenic, organisms, is, called, microbiology, while, parasitology, refers, to, the, scientific, study, of, parasites, and, the, organisms, that, host, them, there, are, several, pathways, through, which, pathogens, can, invade, a, host, the, principal, pathways, have, different, episodic, time, frames, but, soil, has, the, longest, or, most, persistent, potential, for, harboring, a, pathogen, diseases, in, humans, that, are, caused, by, infectious, agents, are, known, as, pathogenic, diseases, not, all, diseases, are, caused, by, pathogens, such, as, black, lung, from, exposure, to, the, pollutant, coal, dust, genetic, disorders, like, sickle, cell, disease, and, autoimmune, diseases, like, lupus, pathogenicity, is, the, potential, disease, causing, capacity, of, pathogens, involving, a, combination, of, infectivity, pathogen, s, ability, to, infect, hosts, and, virulence, severity, of, host, disease, koch, s, postulates, are, used, to, establish, causal, relationships, between, microbial, pathogens, and, diseases, whereas, meningitis, can, be, caused, by, a, variety, of, bacterial, viral, fungal, and, parasitic, pathogens, cholera, is, only, caused, by, some, strains, of, vibrio, cholerae, additionally, some, pathogens, may, only, cause, disease, in, hosts, with, an, immunodeficiency, these, opportunistic, infections, often, involve, hospital, acquired, infections, among, patients, already, combating, another, condition, infectivity, involves, pathogen, transmission, through, direct, contact, with, the, bodily, fluids, or, airborne, droplets, of, infected, hosts, indirect, contact, involving, contaminated, areas, items, or, transfer, by, living, vectors, like, mosquitos, and, ticks, the, basic, reproduction, number, of, an, infection, is, the, expected, number, of, subsequent, cases, it, is, likely, to, cause, through, transmission, virulence, involves, pathogens, extracting, host, nutrients, for, their, survival, evading, host, immune, systems, by, producing, microbial, toxins, and, causing, immunosuppression, optimal, virulence, describes, a, theorized, equilibrium, between, a, pathogen, spreading, to, additional, hosts, to, parasitize, resources, while, lowering, their, virulence, to, keep, hosts, living, for, vertical, transmission, to, their, offspring, algae, are, single, celled, eukaryotes, that, are, generally, non, pathogenic, green, algae, from, the, genus, prototheca, lack, chlorophyll, and, are, known, to, cause, the, disease, protothecosis, in, humans, dogs, cats, and, cattle, typically, involving, the, soil, associated, species, prototheca, wickerhami, bacteria, are, single, celled, prokaryotes, that, range, in, size, from, 0, 15, and, 700, m, while, the, vast, majority, are, either, harmless, or, beneficial, to, their, hosts, such, as, members, of, the, human, gut, microbiome, that, support, digestion, a, small, percentage, are, pathogenic, and, cause, infectious, diseases, bacterial, virulence, factors, include, adherence, factors, to, attach, to, host, cells, invasion, factors, supporting, entry, into, host, cells, capsules, to, prevent, opsonization, and, phagocytosis, toxins, and, siderophores, to, acquire, iron, the, bacterial, disease, tuberculosis, primarily, caused, by, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, has, one, of, the, highest, disease, burdens, killing, 1, 6, million, people, in, 2021, mostly, in, africa, and, southeast, asia, bacterial, pneumonia, is, primarily, caused, by, streptococcus, pneumoniae, staphylococcus, aureus, klebsiella, pneumoniae, and, haemophilus, influenzae, foodborne, illnesses, typically, involve, campylobacter, clostridium, perfringens, escherichia, coli, listeria, monocytogenes, and, salmonella, other, infectious, diseases, caused, by, pathogenic, bacteria, include, tetanus, typhoid, fever, diphtheria, and, leprosy, fungi, are, eukaryotic, organisms, that, can, function, as, pathogens, there, are, approximately, 300, known, fungi, that, are, pathogenic, to, humans, including, candida, albicans, which, is, the, most, common, cause, of, thrush, and, cryptococcus, neoformans, which, can, cause, a, severe, form, of, meningitis, typical, fungal, spores, are, 4, 7, m, long, or, smaller, prions, are, misfolded, proteins, that, transmit, their, abnormal, folding, pattern, to, other, copies, of, the, protein, without, using, nucleic, acids, besides, obtaining, prions, from, others, these, misfolded, proteins, arise, from, genetic, differences, either, due, to, family, history, or, sporadic, mutations, plants, uptake, prions, from, contaminated, soil, and, transport, them, into, their, stem, and, leaves, potentially, transmitting, the, prions, to, herbivorous, animals, additionally, wood, rocks, plastic, glass, cement, stainless, steel, and, aluminum, have, been, shown, binding, retaining, and, releasing, prions, showcasing, that, the, proteins, resist, environmental, degradation, prions, are, best, known, for, causing, transmissible, spongiform, encephalopathy, tse, diseases, like, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, cjd, variant, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, vcjd, gerstmann, str, ussler, scheinker, syndrome, gss, fatal, familial, insomnia, ffi, and, kuru, in, humans, while, prions, are, typically, viewed, as, pathogens, that, cause, protein, amyloid, fibers, to, accumulate, into, neurodegenerative, plaques, susan, lindquist, led, research, showing, that, yeast, use, prions, to, pass, on, evolutionarily, beneficial, traits, not, to, be, confused, with, virusoids, or, viruses, viroids, are, the, smallest, known, infectious, pathogens, viroids, are, small, single, stranded, circular, rna, that, are, only, known, to, cause, plant, diseases, such, as, the, potato, spindle, tuber, viroid, that, affects, various, agricultural, crops, viroid, rna, is, not, protected, by, a, protein, coat, and, it, does, not, encode, any, proteins, only, acting, as, a, ribozyme, to, catalyze, other, biochemical, reactions, viruses, are, generally, between, 20, 200, nm, in, diameter, for, survival, and, replication, viruses, inject, their, genome, into, host, cells, insert, those, genes, into, the, host, genome, and, hijack, the, host, s, machinery, to, produce, hundreds, of, new, viruses, until, the, cell, bursts, open, to, release, them, for, additional, infections, the, lytic, cycle, describes, this, active, state, of, rapidly, killing, hosts, while, the, lysogenic, cycle, describes, potentially, hundreds, of, years, of, dormancy, while, integrated, in, the, host, genome, alongside, the, taxonomy, organized, by, the, international, committee, on, taxonomy, of, viruses, ictv, the, baltimore, classification, separates, viruses, by, seven, classes, of, mrna, production, protozoans, are, single, celled, eukaryotes, that, feed, on, microorganisms, and, organic, tissues, many, protozoans, act, as, pathogenic, parasites, to, cause, diseases, like, malaria, amoebiasis, giardiasis, toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, trichomoniasis, chagas, disease, leishmaniasis, african, trypanosomiasis, sleeping, sickness, acanthamoeba, keratitis, and, primary, amoebic, meningoencephalitis, naegleriasis, parasitic, worms, helminths, are, macroparasites, that, can, be, seen, by, the, naked, eye, worms, live, and, feed, in, their, living, host, acquiring, nutrients, and, shelter, in, the, digestive, tract, or, bloodstream, of, their, host, they, also, manipulate, the, host, s, immune, system, by, secreting, immunomodulatory, products, which, allows, them, to, live, in, their, host, for, years, helminthiasis, is, the, generalized, term, for, parasitic, worm, infections, which, typically, involve, roundworms, tapeworms, and, flatworms, while, bacteria, are, typically, viewed, as, pathogens, they, serve, as, hosts, to, bacteriophage, viruses, commonly, known, as, phages, the, bacteriophage, life, cycle, involves, the, viruses, injecting, their, genome, into, bacterial, cells, inserting, those, genes, into, the, bacterial, genome, and, hijacking, the, bacteria, s, machinery, to, produce, hundreds, of, new, phages, until, the, cell, bursts, open, to, release, them, for, additional, infections, typically, bacteriophages, are, only, capable, of, infecting, a, specific, species, or, strain, streptococcus, pyogenes, uses, a, cas9, nuclease, to, cleave, foreign, dna, matching, the, clustered, regularly, interspaced, short, palindromic, repeats, crispr, associated, with, bacteriophages, removing, the, viral, genes, to, avoid, infection, this, mechanism, has, been, modified, for, artificial, crispr, gene, editing, plants, can, play, host, to, a, wide, range, of, pathogen, types, including, viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and, even, other, plants, notable, plant, viruses, include, the, papaya, ringspot, virus, which, has, caused, millions, of, dollars, of, damage, to, farmers, in, hawaii, and, southeast, asia, and, the, tobacco, mosaic, virus, which, caused, scientist, martinus, beijerinck, to, coin, the, term, virus, in, 1898, bacterial, plant, pathogens, cause, leaf, spots, blight, and, rot, in, many, plant, species, the, most, common, bacterial, pathogens, for, plants, are, pseudomonas, syringae, and, ralstonia, solanacearum, which, cause, leaf, browning, and, other, issues, in, potatoes, tomatoes, and, bananas, fungi, are, another, major, pathogen, type, for, plants, they, can, cause, a, wide, variety, of, issues, such, as, shorter, plant, height, growths, or, pits, on, tree, trunks, root, or, seed, rot, and, leaf, spots, common, and, serious, plant, fungi, include, the, rice, blast, fungus, dutch, elm, disease, chestnut, blight, and, the, black, knot, and, brown, rot, diseases, of, cherries, plums, and, peaches, it, is, estimated, that, pathogenic, fungi, alone, cause, up, to, a, 65, reduction, in, crop, yield, overall, plants, have, a, wide, array, of, pathogens, and, it, has, been, estimated, that, only, 3, of, the, disease, caused, by, plant, pathogens, can, be, managed, animals, often, get, infected, with, many, of, the, same, or, similar, pathogens, as, humans, including, prions, viruses, bacteria, and, fungi, while, wild, animals, often, get, illnesses, the, larger, danger, is, for, livestock, animals, it, is, estimated, that, in, rural, settings, 90, or, more, of, livestock, deaths, can, be, attributed, to, pathogens, animal, transmissible, spongiform, encephalopathy, tses, involving, prions, include, bovine, spongiform, encephalopathy, mad, cow, disease, chronic, wasting, disease, scrapie, transmissible, mink, encephalopathy, feline, spongiform, encephalopathy, and, ungulate, spongiform, encephalopathy, other, animal, diseases, include, a, variety, of, immunodeficiency, disorders, caused, by, viruses, related, to, human, immunodeficiency, virus, hiv, such, as, biv, and, fiv, humans, can, be, infected, with, many, types, of, pathogens, including, prions, viruses, bacteria, and, fungi, causing, symptoms, like, sneezing, coughing, fever, vomiting, and, potentially, lethal, organ, failure, while, some, symptoms, are, caused, by, the, pathogenic, infection, others, are, caused, by, the, immune, system, s, efforts, to, kill, the, pathogen, such, as, feverishly, high, body, temperatures, meant, to, denature, pathogenic, cells, despite, many, attempts, no, therapy, has, been, shown, to, halt, the, progression, of, prion, diseases, a, variety, of, prevention, and, treatment, options, exist, for, some, viral, pathogens, vaccines, are, one, common, and, effective, preventive, measure, against, a, variety, of, viral, pathogens, vaccines, prime, the, immune, system, of, the, host, so, that, when, the, potential, host, encounters, the, virus, in, the, wild, the, immune, system, can, defend, against, infection, quickly, vaccines, designed, against, viruses, include, annual, influenza, vaccines, and, the, two, dose, mmr, vaccine, against, measles, mumps, and, rubella, vaccines, are, not, available, against, the, viruses, responsible, for, hiv, aids, dengue, and, chikungunya, treatment, of, viral, infections, often, involves, treating, the, symptoms, of, the, infection, rather, than, providing, medication, to, combat, the, viral, pathogen, itself, treating, the, symptoms, of, a, viral, infection, gives, the, host, immune, system, time, to, develop, antibodies, against, the, viral, pathogen, however, for, hiv, highly, active, antiretroviral, therapy, haart, is, conducted, to, prevent, the, viral, disease, from, progressing, into, aids, as, immune, cells, are, lost, much, like, viral, pathogens, infection, by, certain, bacterial, pathogens, can, be, prevented, via, vaccines, vaccines, against, bacterial, pathogens, include, the, anthrax, vaccine, and, pneumococcal, vaccine, many, other, bacterial, pathogens, lack, vaccines, as, a, preventive, measure, but, infection, by, these, bacteria, can, often, be, treated, or, prevented, with, antibiotics, common, antibiotics, include, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and, doxycycline, each, antibiotic, has, different, bacteria, that, it, is, effective, against, and, has, different, mechanisms, to, kill, that, bacteria, for, example, doxycycline, inhibits, the, synthesis, of, new, proteins, in, both, gram, negative, and, gram, positive, bacteria, which, makes, it, a, broad, spectrum, antibiotic, capable, of, killing, most, bacterial, species, due, to, misuse, of, antibiotics, such, as, prematurely, ended, prescriptions, exposing, bacteria, to, evolutionary, pressure, under, sublethal, doses, some, bacterial, pathogens, have, developed, antibiotic, resistance, for, example, a, genetically, distinct, strain, of, staphylococcus, aureus, called, mrsa, is, resistant, to, the, commonly, prescribed, beta, lactam, antibiotics, a, 2013, report, from, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, estimated, that, in, the, united, states, at, least, 2, million, people, get, an, antibiotic, resistant, bacterial, infection, annually, with, at, least, 23, 000, of, those, patients, dying, from, the, infection, due, to, their, indispensability, in, combating, bacteria, new, antibiotics, are, required, for, medical, care, one, target, for, new, antimicrobial, medications, involves, inhibiting, dna, methyltransferases, as, these, proteins, control, the, levels, of, expression, for, other, genes, such, as, those, encoding, virulence, factors, infection, by, fungal, pathogens, is, treated, with, anti, fungal, medication, athlete, s, foot, jock, itch, and, ringworm, are, fungal, skin, infections, that, are, treated, with, topical, anti, fungal, medications, like, clotrimazole, infections, involving, the, yeast, species, candida, albicans, cause, oral, thrush, and, vaginal, yeast, infections, these, internal, infections, can, either, be, treated, with, anti, fungal, creams, or, with, oral, medication, common, anti, fungal, drugs, for, internal, infections, include, the, echinocandin, family, of, drugs, and, fluconazole, while, algae, are, commonly, not, thought, of, as, pathogens, the, genus, prototheca, causes, disease, in, humans, treatment, for, protothecosis, is, currently, under, investigation, and, there, is, no, consistency, in, clinical, treatment, many, pathogens, are, capable, of, sexual, interaction, among, pathogenic, bacteria, sexual, interaction, occurs, between, cells, of, the, same, species, by, the, process, of, genetic, transformation, transformation, involves, the, transfer, of, dna, from, a, donor, cell, to, a, recipient, cell, and, the, integration, of, the, donor, dna, into, the, recipient, genome, through, genetic, recombination, the, bacterial, pathogens, helicobacter, pylori, haemophilus, influenzae, legionella, pneumophila, neisseria, gonorrhoeae, and, streptococcus, pneumoniae, frequently, undergo, transformation, to, modify, their, genome, for, additional, traits, and, evasion, of, host, immune, cells, eukaryotic, pathogens, are, often, capable, of, sexual, interaction, by, a, process, involving, meiosis, and, fertilization, meiosis, involves, the, intimate, pairing, of, homologous, chromosomes, and, recombination, between, them, examples, of, eukaryotic, pathogens, capable, of, sex, include, the, protozoan, parasites, plasmodium, falciparum, toxoplasma, gondii, trypanosoma, brucei, giardia, intestinalis, and, the, fungi, aspergillus, fumigatus, candida, albicans, and, cryptococcus, neoformans, viruses, may, also, undergo, sexual, interaction, when, two, or, more, viral, genomes, enter, the, same, host, cell, this, process, involves, pairing, of, homologous, genomes, and, recombination, between, them, by, a, process, referred, to, as, multiplicity, reactivation, the, herpes, simplex, virus, human, immunodeficiency, virus, and, vaccinia, virus, undergo, this, form, of, sexual, interaction, these, processes, of, sexual, recombination, between, homologous, genomes, supports, repairs, to, genetic, damage, caused, by, environmental, stressors, and, host, immune, systems
