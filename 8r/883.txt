the, holstein, friesian, is, an, international, breed, or, group, of, breeds, of, dairy, cattle, it, originated, in, frisia, stretching, from, the, dutch, province, of, north, holland, to, the, german, state, of, schleswig, holstein, it, is, the, dominant, breed, in, industrial, dairy, farming, worldwide, and, is, found, in, more, than, 160, countries, it, is, known, by, many, names, among, them, holstein, friesian, and, black, and, white, with, the, growth, of, the, new, world, a, demand, for, milk, developed, in, north, america, and, south, america, and, dairy, breeders, in, those, regions, at, first, imported, their, livestock, from, the, netherlands, however, after, about, 8, 800, friesians, black, pied, german, cows, had, been, imported, europe, stopped, exporting, dairy, animals, due, to, disease, problems, today, the, breed, is, used, for, milk, in, the, north, of, europe, and, for, meat, in, the, south, of, europe, after, 1945, european, cattle, breeding, and, dairy, products, became, increasingly, confined, to, certain, regions, due, to, the, development, of, national, infrastructure, this, change, led, to, the, need, to, designate, some, animals, for, dairy, production, and, others, for, beef, production, previously, milk, and, beef, had, been, produced, from, dual, purpose, animals, today, more, than, 80, of, dairy, production, takes, place, north, of, the, line, between, bordeaux, and, venice, and, more, than, 60, of, the, cattle, in, europe, are, found, there, as, well, today, s, european, breeds, national, derivatives, of, the, dutch, friesian, have, become, very, different, animals, from, those, developed, by, breeders, in, the, united, states, who, use, holsteins, only, for, dairy, production, as, a, result, breeders, have, imported, specialized, dairy, holsteins, from, the, united, states, to, cross, breed, them, with, european, black, and, whites, today, the, term, holstein, is, used, to, describe, north, or, south, american, stock, and, the, use, of, that, stock, in, europe, particularly, in, northern, europe, friesian, is, used, to, describe, animals, of, traditional, european, ancestry, that, are, bred, for, both, dairy, and, beef, use, crosses, between, the, two, are, described, as, holstein, friesian, holsteins, have, distinctive, markings, usually, black, and, white, or, red, and, white, in, colour, typically, exhibiting, piebald, patterns, on, rare, occasions, some, have, both, black, and, red, colouring, with, white, the, red, factor, causes, this, unique, colouring, blue, is, also, a, known, colour, this, colour, is, produced, by, white, hairs, mixed, with, the, black, hairs, giving, the, cow, a, bluish, tint, this, colouring, is, also, known, as, blue, roan, in, some, farm, circles, they, are, famed, for, their, high, dairy, production, averaging, 22, 530, pounds, 10, 220, kg, of, milk, per, year, of, this, milk, 858, pounds, 3, 7, are, butterfat, and, 719, pounds, 3, 1, are, protein, a, healthy, calf, weighs, 40, to, 50, kg, 75, 110, lb, or, more, at, birth, a, mature, holstein, cow, typically, weighs, 680, 770, kg, 1500, 1700, lb, and, stands, 145, 165, cm, 58, 65, in, tall, at, the, shoulder, holstein, heifers, should, be, bred, by, 11, to, 14, months, of, age, when, they, weigh, 317, 340, kg, 700, 750, lb, or, 55, of, adult, weight, generally, breeders, plan, for, holstein, heifers, to, calve, for, the, first, time, between, 21, and, 24, months, of, age, and, 80, of, adult, body, weight, the, gestation, period, is, about, nine, and, a, half, months, near, 100, bc, a, displaced, group, of, people, from, hesse, migrated, with, their, cattle, to, the, shores, of, the, north, sea, near, the, frisii, tribe, occupying, the, island, of, batavia, between, the, rhine, maas, and, waal, historical, records, suggest, these, cattle, were, black, and, the, friesian, cattle, at, this, time, were, pure, white, and, light, coloured, crossbreeding, may, have, led, to, the, foundation, of, the, present, holstein, friesian, breed, as, the, cattle, of, these, two, tribes, from, then, are, described, identically, in, historical, records, the, portion, of, the, country, bordering, on, the, north, sea, called, frisia, was, situated, within, the, provinces, of, north, holland, friesland, and, groningen, and, in, germany, to, the, river, ems, the, people, were, known, for, their, care, and, breeding, of, cattle, the, frisii, preferring, pastoral, pursuits, to, warfare, paid, a, tax, of, ox, hides, and, ox, horns, to, the, roman, government, whereas, the, batavii, furnished, soldiers, and, officers, to, the, roman, army, these, fought, successfully, in, the, various, roman, wars, the, frisii, bred, the, same, strain, of, cattle, unadulterated, for, 2, 000, years, except, from, accidental, circumstances, in, 1282, ad, floods, produced, the, zuiderzee, a, formed, body, of, water, that, had, the, effect, of, separating, the, cattle, breeders, of, the, modern, day, frisians, into, two, groups, the, western, group, occupied, west, friesland, now, part, of, north, holland, the, eastern, occupied, the, present, provinces, of, friesland, and, groningen, also, in, the, netherlands, the, rich, polder, land, in, the, netherlands, is, unsurpassed, for, the, production, of, grass, cattle, and, dairy, products, between, the, 13th, and, 16th, centuries, the, production, of, butter, and, cheese, was, enormous, historic, records, describe, heavy, beef, cattle, weighing, from, 2, 600, to, 3, 000, pounds, each, the, breeders, had, the, goal, of, producing, as, much, milk, and, beef, as, possible, from, the, same, animal, the, selection, breeding, and, feeding, have, been, carried, out, with, huge, success, inbreeding, was, not, tolerated, and, distinct, families, never, arose, although, differences, in, soil, in, different, localities, produced, different, sizes, and, variations, a, corporate, watch, report, on, dystopian, farming, cited, a, 2004, study, from, the, journal, of, dairy, science, identified, that, between, 96, and, 98, of, uk, holsteins, were, inbred, to, some, degree, compared, with, around, 50, in, 1990, more,

after, which, there, was, an, explosion, in, its, popularity, and, additional, animals, were, imported, more, recently, the, two, societies, merged, in, 1999, to, establish, holstein, uk, records, on,

averaging, 8, 125, litres, year, over, an, average, of, 3, 43, lactations, by, adding, lifetime, production, therefore, stands, at, around, 26, 000, litres, black, and, white, cattle, from, europe, were, introduced, into, the, us, from, 1621, to, 1664, the, eastern, part, of, new, netherland, modern, day, new, york, and, connecticut, where, many, dutch, farmers, settled, along, the, hudson, and, mohawk, river, valleys, they, probably, brought, cattle, with, them, from, their, native, land, and, crossed, them, with, cattle, purchased, in, the, colony, for, many, years, afterwards, the, cattle, here, were, called, dutch, cattle, and, were, renowned, for, their, milking, qualities, the, first, recorded, imports, were, more, than, 100, years, later, consisting, of, six, cows, and, two, bulls, these, were, sent, in, 1795, by, the, holland, land, company, which, then, owned, large, tracts, in, new, york, to, their, agent, mr, john, lincklaen, of, cazenovia, a, settler, described, them, thus, the, cows, were, of, the, size, of, oxen, their, colors, clear, black, and, white, in, large, patches, very, handsome, in, 1810, a, bull, and, two, cows, were, imported, by, the, hon, william, jarvis, for, his, farm, at, wethersfield, vermont, about, the, year, 1825, another, importation, was, made, by, herman, le, roy, a, part, of, which, was, sent, into, the, genesee, river, valley, the, rest, were, kept, near, new, york, city, still, later, an, importation, was, made, into, delaware, no, records, were, kept, of, the, descendants, of, these, cattle, their, blood, was, mingled, and, lost, in, that, of, the, native, cattle, the, first, permanent, introduction, of, this, breed, was, due, to, the, perseverance, of, hon, winthrop, w, chenery, of, belmont, massachusetts, the, animals, of, his, first, two, importations, and, their, offspring, were, destroyed, by, the, government, in, massachusetts, because, of, a, contagious, disease, he, made, a, third, importation, in, 1861, this, was, followed, in, 1867, by, an, importation, for, the, hon, gerrit, s, miller, of, peterboro, new, york, made, by, his, brother, dudley, miller, who, had, been, attending, the, noted, agricultural, school, at, eldena, k, niglich, preu, ische, staats, und, landwirthschaftliche, akademie, zu, greifswald, und, eldena, the, latter, today, a, locality, of, the, former, prussia, where, this, breed, was, highly, regarded, these, two, importations, by, hon, william, a, russell, of, lawrence, mass, and, three, animals, from, east, friesland, imported, by, gen, william, s, tilton, of, the, national, military, asylum, togus, maine, formed, the, nucleus, of, the, holstein, herd, book, the, trina, holstein, breed, was, established, by, the, merrill, farming, family, in, maine, in, the, early, 20th, century, begun, by, trina, redstone, marvel, or, old, trina, and, continued, at, wilsondale, farm, in, gray, maine, trina, has, traced, back, sixteen, generations, to, one, of, the, first, cows, imported, into, the, united, states, there, are, thirty, generations, of, trina, holstein, offspring, today, after, about, 8, 800, holsteins, had, been, imported, a, cattle, disease, broke, out, in, europe, and, importation, ceased, in, the, late, 19th, century, there, was, enough, interest, among, friesian, breeders, to, form, associations, to, record, pedigrees, and, maintain, herd, books, these, associations, merged, in, 1885, to, found, the, holstein, friesian, association, of, america, in, 1994, the, name, was, changed, to, holstein, association, usa, the, 2008, average, actual, production, for, all, usa, holstein, herds, that, were, enrolled, in, production, testing, programs, and, eligible, for, genetic, evaluations, was, 23, 022, pounds, 10, 443, kg, of, milk, 840, pounds, 380, kg, of, butterfat, and, 709, pounds, 322, kg, of, protein, per, year, total, lifetime, productivity, can, be, inferred, from, the, average, lifetime, of, us, cows, this, has, been, decreasing, regularly, in, recent, years, and, now, stands, at, around, 2, 75, lactations, which, when, multiplied, by, average, lactation, yield, above, gives, around, 61, 729, pounds, 28, 000, kg, of, milk, the, current, national, holstein, milk, production, leader, is, bur, wall, buckeye, gigi, ex, 94, 3e, which, produced, 74, 650, pounds, 33, 860, kg, of, milk, in, 365, days, completing, her, record, in, 2016, the, considerable, advantage, compared, to, the, uk, for, example, can, be, explained, by, several, factors, the, golden, age, of, friesian, breeding, occurred, during, the, last, 50, years, greatly, helped, lately, by, embryo, transfer, techniques, which, permitted, a, huge, multiplication, of, bulls, entering, progeny, testing, of, elite, bull, mother, cows, friesian, bull, osborndale,

news, cameras, broadcast, this, as, breaking, news, among, many, of, the, country, s, top, news, stations, since, then, this, calf, had, been, rumored, to, have, been, put, down, to, protect, the, owners, the, eatons, from, invasions, of, the, press, while, interest, in, increasing, production, through, indexing, and, lifetime, profit, scores, had, a, huge, increase, in, holstein, bloodlines, in, the, uk, proponents, of, the, traditional, british, friesian, did, not, see, things, that, way, and, maintain, these, criteria, do, not, reflect, the, true, profitability, or, the, production, of, the, friesian, cow, friesian, breeders, say, modern, conditions, in, the, uk, similar, to, the, 1950s, through, to, the, 1980s, with, low, milk, price, and, the, need, for, extensive, low, cost, systems, for, many, farmers, may, ultimately, cause, producers, to, re, examine, the, attributes, of, the, british, friesian, this, animal, came, to, dominate, the, uk, dairy, cow, population, during, these, years, with, exports, of, stock, and, semen, to, many, countries, throughout, the, world, although, the, idea, of, dual, purpose, animals, has, arguably, become, outmoded, the, fact, remains, that, the, friesian, is, eminently, suitable, for, many, farms, particularly, where, grazing, is, a, main, feature, of, the, system, proponents, argue, that, friesians, last, for, more, lactations, through, more, robust, conformation, thus, spreading, depreciation, costs, an, added, advantage, of, income, from, the, male, calf, exists, which, can, be, placed, into, barley, beef, systems, finishing, from, 11, months, or, steers, taken, on, to, finish, at, two, years, on, a, cheap, system, of, grass, and, silage, very, respectable, grades, can, be, obtained, commensurate, with, beef, breeds, thereby, providing, extra, income, for, the, farm, such, extensive, low, cost, systems, may, imply, lower, veterinary, costs, through, good, fertility, resistance, to, lameness, and, a, tendency, to, higher, protein, percentage, and, therefore, higher, milk, price, an, 800, kg, holstein, has, a, higher, daily, maintenance, energy, requirement, than, the, 650, kg, friesian, friesians, have, also, been, disadvantaged, through, the, comparison, of, their, type, to, a, holstein, base, a, separate, index, be, composed, to, greater, has, been, suggested, to, reflect, the, aspects, of, maintenance, for, bodyweight, protein, percentage, longevity, and, calf, value, national, milk, records, figures, suggest, highest, yields, are, achieved, between, the, fifth, and, seventh, lactations, if, so, this, is, particularly, so, for, friesians, with, a, greater, lift, for, mature, cows, and, sustained, over, more, lactations, however, production, index, only, takes, the, first, five, lactations, into, account, british, friesian, breeding, has, certainly, not, stood, still, and, through, studied, evaluation, substantial, gains, in, yield, have, been, achieved, without, the,

importations, were, stopped, in, 1892, as, a, precaution, against, endemic, foot, and, mouth, disease, on, the, continent, they, were, so, few, in, number, they, were, not, included, in, the, 1908, census, in, 1909, though, the, society, was, formed, as, the, british, holstein, cattle, society, soon, to, be, changed, to, british, holstein, friesian, society, and, by, 1918, to, the, british, friesian, cattle, society, the, livestock, journal, of, 1900, referred, to, both, the, exceptionally, good, and, remarkably, inferior, dutch, cattle, the, dutch, cow, was, also, considered, to, require, more, quality, fodder, and, need, more, looking, after, than, some, english, cattle, that, could, easily, be, out, wintered, in, an, era, of, agricultural, depression, breed, societies, notably, had, flourished, as, a, valuable, export, trade, developed, for, traditional, british, breeds, of, cattle, at, the, end, of, 1912, the, herd, book, noted, 1, 000, males, and, 6, 000, females, the, stock, which, originally, formed, the, foundation, of, the, breed, in, england, and, scotland, entry, from, then, until, 1921, when, grading, up, was, introduced, was, by, pedigree, only, no, other, friesian, cattle, were, imported, until, the, official, importation, of, 1914, which, included, several, near, descendants, of, the, renowned, dairy, bull, ceres, 4497, f, r, s, these, cattle, were, successful, in, establishing, the, friesian, as, an, eminent, long, lived, dairy, breed, in, britain, this, role, was, continued, in, the, 1922, importation, from, south, africa, through, terling, marthus, and, terling, collona, which, were, also, near, descendants, of, ceres, 4497, the, 1936, importation, from, the, netherlands, introduced, a, more, dual, purpose, type, of, animal, the, dutch, having, moved, away, from, the, ceres, line, in, the, meantime, the, 1950, importation, has, a, lesser, influence, on, the, breed, today, than, the, previous, importations, although, various, adema, sons, were, used, successfully, in, some, herds, the, friesian, enjoyed, great, expansion, in, the, 1950s, through, to, the, 80s, until, the, increased, holstein, influence, on, the, national, herd, in, the, 1990s, a, trend, which, is, being, questioned, by, some, commercial, dairy, farmers, in, the, harsh, dairying, climate, that, prevails, today, with, the, need, to, exploit, grazing, potential, to, the, fullest, friesian, semen, is, once, again, being, exported, to, countries, with, grass, based, systems, of, milk, production, the, modern, friesian, is, pre, eminently, a, grazing, animal, well, able, to, sustain, itself, over, many, lactations, on, both, low, lying, and, upland, grasslands, being, developed, by, selective, breeding, over, the, last, 100, years, some, outstanding, examples, of, the, breed, have, 12, to, 15, lactations, to, their, credit, emphasising, their, inherent, natural, fecundity, in, response, to, demand, protein, percentages, have, been, raised, across, the, breed, and, herd, protein, levels, of, 3, 4, to, 3, 5, are, not, uncommon, whilst, the, british, friesian, is, first, and, foremost, a, dairy, breed, giving, high, lifetime, yields, of, quality, milk, from, home, produced, feeds, by, a, happy, coincidence, surplus, male, animals, are, highly, regarded, as, producers, of, high, quality, lean, meat, whether, crossed, with, a, beef, breed, or, not, beef, cross, heifers, have, long, been, sought, after, as, ideal, suckler, cow, replacements, although, understanding, the, need, to, change, the, society, s, name, to, include, the, word, holstein, in, 1988, british, friesian, enthusiasts, are, less, than, happy, now, that, the, word, friesian, has, been, removed, from, the, name, with, the, history, of, the, breed, spanning, 100, years, the, british, friesian, cow, is, continuing, to, prove, her, worth, the, general, robustness, and, proven, fertility, provide, an, ideal, black, and, white, cross, for, holstein, breeders, seeking, these, attributes, the, disposal, of, male, black, and, white, calves, continues, to, receive, media, attention, and, would, appear, to, be, a, waste, of, a, valuable, resource, one, of, the, great, strengths, of, the, british, friesian, is, the, ability, of, the, male, calf, to, finish, and, grade, satisfactorily, either, in, intensive, systems, or, as, steers, extensively, this, latter, system, may, become, increasingly, popular, due, to, the, prohibitive, increase, in, grain, prices, the, robustness, of, the, british, friesian, and, its, suitability, to, grazing, and, forage, systems, is, well, known, compared, to, the, holsteins, the, friesians, the, first, polled, holstein, was, identified, in, the, united, states, in, 1889, polled, holsteins, have, the, dominant, polled, gene, which, makes, them, naturally, hornless, the, polled, gene, has, historically, had, a, very, low, gene, frequency, in, the, holstein, breed, however, with, animal, welfare, concerns, surrounding, the, practice, of, dehorning, the, interest, in, polled, genetics, is, growing, rapidly, the, expression, of, red, colour, replacing, the, black, in, holsteins, is, a, function, of, a, recessive, gene, assuming, the, allele, b, stands, for, the, dominant, black, and, b, for, the, recessive, red, cattle, with, the, paired, genes, bb, bb, or, bb, would, be, black, and, white, while, bb, cattle, would, be, red, and, white, earlier, 13th, century, records, show, cattle, of, broken, colours, entered, the, netherlands, from, central, europe, most, foundation, stock, in, the, us, were, imported, between, 1869, and, 1885, a, group, of, early, breeders, decreed, that, animals, of, any, colour, other, than, black, and, white, would, not, be, accepted, in, the, herd, book, and, that, the, breed, would, be, known, as, holsteins, there, were, objections, saying, that, quality, and, not, colour, should, be, the, aim, and, that, the, cattle, should, be, called, dutch, rather, than, holsteins, only, a, small, number, of, carriers, were, identified, over, the, hundred, year, span, from, the, early, importations, until, they, were, accepted, into, the, canadian, and, american, herd, books, in, 1969, and, 1970, respectively, most, of, the, early, accounts, of, red, calves, being, born, to, black, and, white, parents, were, never, documented, a, few, stories, of, reds, born, to, elite, parents, persist, over, time, as, there, is, a, tendency, to, credit, the, ancestor, with, the, highest, closest, relationship, to, a, red, carrier, animal, as, the, one, that, transmitted, the, trait, whereas, sometimes, it, is, the, other, parental, line, that, has, passed, it, on, even, though, the, ancestor, responsible, may, have, entered, the, pedigree, several, generations, earlier, in, 1952, a, sire, in, an, artificial, insemination, ai, unit, in, the, us, was, a, carrier, of, red, coat, colour, although, the, ai, unit, reported, the, condition, and, advised, breeders, as, to, its, mode, of, inheritance, almost, a, third, of, the, breeding, unit, s, holstein, inseminations, that, year, were, to, that, red, carrier, bull, that, year, american, ai, units, had, used, 67, red, factor, bulls, that, had, sired, 8250, registered, progeny, in, spite, of, this, any, change, to, the, colour, marking, rules, was, rejected, the, red, and, white, dairy, cattle, association, rwdca, began, registry, procedures, in, 1964, in, the, united, states, its, first, members, were, milking, shorthorn, breeders, who, wanted, a, dairy, registry, for, the, cattle, they, had, bred, in, prior, years, including, some, red, and, white, holsteins, when, milking, shorthorn, breeders, were, looking, for, potential, outcrossing, individuals, to, improve, milk, production, red, and, white, holsteins, came, into, the, picture, since, the, red, colour, factor, is, the, same, for, both, breeds, the, rwdca, had, adopted, an, open, herd, book, policy, and, the, red, and, white, holstein, became, the, major, player, the, red, trait, was, thus, able, to, survive, the, attempts, to, eradicate, it, that, came, from, all, sides, of, the, holstein, industry, it, was, inevitable, that, even, when, a, red, calf, was, culled, the, herd, owner, rarely, did, anything, to, remove, the, dam, from, his, herd, and, only, hoped, she, would, not, have, another, red, calf, many, red, calves, born, in, both, countries, prior, to, the, 1970s, were, quietly, disposed, of, with, a, view, to, preserving, the, acceptance, of, their, elite, pedigrees, also, thousands, of, holsteins, were, imported, from, canada, each, year, and, many, were, carriers, more, than, 14, 000, holsteins, were, exported, to, the, united, states, in, 1964, and, again, in, 1965, this, was, at, a, time, when, both, countries, were, debating, the, red, question, while, the, united, states, was, trying, to, eliminate, the, red, trait, the, canadian, imports, simply, counterbalanced, the, us, effort, to, reduce, its, incidence, canada, s, number, one, red, carrier, sire, in, the, 1940s, was, a, b, c, reflection, sovereign, his, sons, and, grandsons, in, the, 1950s, and, 60s, spread, the, red, gene, throughout, canada, and, increased, its, frequency, in, the, united, states, three, other, big, names, siring, red, and, whites, in, the, united, states, were, rosafe, citation, r, roeland, reflection, sovereign, and, chambric, a, b, c, the, red, trait, was, readily, available, in, canadian, holstein, genetics, early, on, there, was, criticism, of, the, policy, of, the, canadian, ai, units, to, remove, bulls, found, to, carry, red, a, number, of, superior, bulls, were, slaughtered, or, exported, the, studs, were, simply, supporting, the, canadian, policy, to, prevent, the, intensification, of, the, red, recessive, in, the, breed, the, phrase, carries, the, red, factor, had, to, be, included, in, the, description, and, excessive, promotion, of, unproven, red, factor, bulls, was, discouraged, they, later, added, the, aim, of, permitting, intelligent, breeders, to, use, any, red, carrier, sire, that, had, an, outstanding, proof, for, production, and, type, it, became, obvious, that, ai, was, the, primary, way, of, finding, out, which, bulls, were, red, carriers, prior, to, ai, few, red, carrier, sires, were, uncovered, because, their, service, was, limited, to, one, or, a, few, herds, such, herds, often, had, no, carrier, females, and, there, was, only, a, 25, chance, that, a, carrier, bull, mated, to, a, carrier, female, would, produce, a, red, calf, if, a, red, and, white, calf, were, dropped, it, was, often, concealed, and, quietly, removed, from, the, herd, in, 1964, the, netherlands, herd, book, society, indicated, a, breakdown, of, 71, black, and, white, friesian, and, 28, red, and, whites, a, herd, book, that, accepted, red, and, whites, had, already, been, established, in, the, united, states, a, separate, herd, book, for, canadian, red, and, whites, was, then, established, following, which, red, and, whites, became, acceptable, to, the, major, canadian, export, markets, the, sales, ring, began, to, establish, interest, in, the, new, breed, the, us, holstein, friesian, association, and, its, membership, worked, diligently, from, its, early, days, until, 1970, to, eliminate, the, red, trait, from, the, registered, population, however, once, the, door, was, open, red, and, whites, began, to, appear, in, some, of, the, more, elite, herds, the, rush, to, get, the, best, of, canadian, breeding, even, prior, to, the, opening, of, the, herd, book, brought, red, calves, to, many, dairymen, who, had, never, even, seen, one, canadian, red, and, whites, became, eligible, for, registration, in, the, herd, book, on, july, 1, 1969, through, an, alternate, registry, red, and, whites, were, to, be, listed, with, the, suffix, red, and, black, and, whites, with, ineligible, markings, would, be, registered, with, the, suffix, alt, both, groups, and, their, progeny, would, be, listed, only, in, the, alternate, book, and, the, suffixes, had, to, be, part, of, the, name, in, the, canadian, herd, books, all, alt, and, red, animals, were, listed, in, the, regular, herd, book, in, registration, number, order, and, were, identified, with, an, a, in, front, of, their, numbers, the, alternates, were, separate, in, name, only, the, a, in, front, of, the, registration, number, was, discontinued, in, 1976, and, the, alt, suffix, was, dropped, in, 1980, but, red, was, continued, it, did, not, bar, the, registration, of, animals, whose, hair, turned, from, red, to, black, the, us, holstein, association, decided, not, to, have, a, separate, herd, book, for, red, and, whites, and, off, color, animals, the, suffixes, of, red, and, oc, would, be, used, and, numbering, would, be, consecutive, the, first, red, and, white, holsteins, were, recorded, with, an, r, in, front, of, their, numbers, 212, males, and, 1191, females, were, recorded, in, the, initial, group, of, red, registrations, red, and, whites, registered, in, the, canadian, herd, book, numbered, 281, in, 1969, and, 243, in, 1970, an, american, breeders, service, ad, in, the, canadian, holstein, journal, in, 1974, on, hanover, hill, triple, threat, mentioned, one, of, several, colour, variants, that, were, not, true, red, its, existence, was, undoubtedly, common, knowledge, among, breeders, in, both, countries, but, until, that, time, it, had, not, been, mentioned, in, print, calves, were, born, red, and, white, and, registered, as, such, but, over, the, first, six, months, of, age, turned, black, or, mostly, black, with, some, reddish, hairs, down, the, backline, around, the, muzzle, and, at, the, poll, the, hair, coat, colour, change, became, known, as, black, red, and, sometimes, as, telstar, red, since, the, condition, appeared, in, calves, sired, by, roybrook, telstar, telstar, was, the, sire, of, triple, threat, but, nothing, about, this, had, hitherto, been, in, print, about, telstar, which, was, by, then, over, 10, years, old, black, reds, were, often, discriminated, against, when, sold, and, were, barred, from, red, and, white, sponsored, shows, in, 1984, holstein, canada, considered, recoding, b, r, bulls, that, had, always, been, coded, simply, as, red, carriers, a, designation, that, was, not, acceptable, to, all, buyers, the, breed, agreed, to, change, after, checking, with, other, breed, associations, and, with, the, ai, industry, in, 1987, holstein, canada, and, the, canadian, ai, industry, modified, their, coding, procedures, to, distinguish, between, black, red, and, true, red, colour, patterns, for, bulls, holstein, canada, dropped, the, suffix, red, as, a, part, of, the, name, in, 1990, but, continued, to, carry, it, as, part, of, the, birth, date, and, other, codes, field
