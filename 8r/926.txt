philodendron, is, a, large, genus, of, flowering, plants, in, the, family, araceae, as, of, june, 2024, the, plants, of, the, world, online, accepted, 621, species, other, sources, accept, different, numbers, regardless, of, number, of, species, the, genus, is, the, second, largest, member, of, the, family, araceae, after, genus, anthurium, taxonomically, the, genus, philodendron, is, still, poorly, known, with, many, undescribed, species, many, are, grown, as, ornamental, and, indoor, plants, the, name, derives, from, the, greek, words, philo, love, affection, and, dendron, tree, the, generic, name, philodendron, is, often, used, as, the, english, name, compared, to, other, genera, of, the, family, araceae, philodendrons, have, an, extremely, diverse, array, of, growth, methods, the, habits, of, growth, can, be, epiphytic, hemiepiphytic, or, rarely, terrestrial, others, can, show, a, combination, of, these, growth, habits, depending, on, the, environment, hemiepiphytic, philodendrons, can, be, classified, into, two, types, primary, and, secondary, hemiepiphytes, a, primary, hemiepiphytic, philodendron, starts, life, high, up, in, the, canopy, where, the, seed, initially, sprouts, the, plant, then, grows, as, an, epiphyte, once, it, has, reached, a, sufficient, size, and, age, it, will, begin, producing, aerial, roots, that, grow, toward, the, forest, floor, once, they, reach, the, forest, floor, nutrients, can, be, obtained, directly, from, the, soil, in, this, manner, the, plant, s, strategy, is, to, obtain, light, early, in, its, life, at, the, expense, of, nutrients, some, primary, epiphytic, species, have, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, ants, in, these, species, the, ants, nest, is, grown, amongst, the, plant, s, roots, which, help, keep, the, nest, together, philodendrons, have, extrafloral, nectaries, glands, that, secrete, nectar, to, attract, the, ants, the, philodendron, in, turn, obtains, nutrients, from, the, surrounding, ant, nest, and, the, aggressive, nature, of, the, ants, serves, to, protect, the, plant, from, other, insects, which, would, eat, it, secondary, hemiepiphytes, start, life, on, the, ground, or, on, part, of, a, tree, trunk, very, close, to, the, ground, where, the, seeds, sprout, these, philodendrons, have, their, roots, in, the, ground, early, in, their, lives, they, then, begin, climbing, up, a, tree, and, eventually, may, become, completely, epiphytic, doing, away, with, their, subterranean, roots, secondary, hemiepiphytes, do, not, always, start, their, lives, close, to, a, tree, for, these, philodendrons, the, plant, will, grow, with, long, internodes, along, the, ground, until, a, tree, is, found, they, find, a, suitable, tree, by, growing, towards, darker, areas, such, as, the, dark, shadow, of, a, tree, this, trait, is, called, scototropism, after, a, tree, has, been, found, the, scototropic, behavior, stops, and, the, philodendron, switches, to, a, phototropic, growth, habit, and, the, internodes, shorten, and, thicken, usually, however, philodendrons, germinate, on, trees, the, leaves, are, usually, large, and, imposing, often, lobed, or, deeply, cut, and, may, be, more, or, less, pinnate, they, can, also, be, oval, philodendron, white, princess, spear, shaped, divided, philodendron, tripartitum, or, in, many, other, possible, shape, variations, the, leaves, are, borne, alternately, on, the, stem, a, quality, of, philodendrons, is, that, they, do, not, have, a, single, type, of, leaf, on, the, same, plant, instead, they, have, juvenile, leaves, and, adult, leaves, which, can, be, drastically, different, from, one, another, the, leaves, of, seedling, philodendrons, are, usually, heart, shaped, early, in, the, life, of, the, plant, but, after, it, has, matured, past, the, seedling, stage, the, leaves, will, acquire, the, typical, juvenile, leaf, s, shape, and, size, later, in, the, philodendron, s, life, it, starts, producing, adult, leaves, a, process, called, metamorphosis, most, philodendrons, go, through, metamorphosis, gradually, there, is, no, immediately, distinct, difference, between, juvenile, and, adult, leaves, aside, from, being, typically, much, bigger, than, the, juvenile, leaves, the, shape, of, adult, leaves, can, be, significantly, different, in, fact, considerable, taxonomic, difficulty, has, occurred, in, the, past, due, to, these, differences, causing, juvenile, and, adult, plants, to, mistakenly, be, classified, as, different, species, the, trigger, for, the, transformation, to, adult, leaves, can, vary, considerably, one, possible, trigger, is, the, height, of, the, plant, secondary, hemiepiphytes, start, off, on, the, dark, forest, floor, and, climb, their, way, up, a, tree, displaying, their, juvenile, type, leaves, along, the, way, once, they, reach, a, sufficient, height, they, begin, developing, adult, type, leaves, the, smaller, juvenile, leaves, are, used, for, the, darker, forest, floor, where, light, is, in, scarce, supply, but, once, they, reach, a, sufficient, height, in, the, canopy, the, light, is, bright, enough, that, the, bigger, adult, leaves, can, serve, a, useful, purpose, another, possible, trigger, occurs, in, primary, hemiepiphytes, these, philodendrons, typically, send, their, aerial, roots, downward, once, their, roots, have, reached, the, ground, below, the, plant, will, begin, taking, up, nutrients, from, the, soil, of, which, it, had, been, previously, deprived, as, a, result, the, plant, will, quickly, morph, into, its, adult, leaves, and, gain, in, size, dramatically, another, quality, of, philodendrons, leaves, is, they, are, often, quite, different, in, shape, and, size, even, between, two, plants, of, the, same, species, as, a, result, of, all, these, different, possible, leaf, shapes, it, is, often, difficult, to, differentiate, natural, variations, from, morphogenesis, philodendrons, also, produce, cataphylls, which, are, modified, leaves, that, surround, and, protect, the, newly, forming, leaves, cataphylls, are, usually, green, leaf, like, and, rigid, while, they, are, protecting, the, leaf, in, some, species, they, can, even, be, rather, succulent, once, the, leaf, has, been, fully, formed, the, cataphyll, usually, remains, attached, where, the, stem, and, base, of, the, leaf, meet, in, philodendrons, cataphylls, typically, fall, into, two, categories, deciduous, and, persistent, types, a, deciduous, cataphyll, curls, away, from, the, leaf, once, it, has, formed, eventually, turning, brown, and, drying, out, and, finally, falling, off, the, plant, leaving, a, scar, on, the, stem, where, it, was, attached, deciduous, cataphylls, are, typically, found, on, vining, philodendrons, whereas, persistent, cataphylls, are, typical, of, epiphytic, philodendrons, or, appressed, climbers, in, the, latter, the, cataphylls, are, prevented, from, falling, off, in, a, timely, manner, due, to, the, short, internodes, of, the, plant, the, cataphylls, will, remain, attached, drying, out, and, becoming, nothing, more, than, fibers, attached, at, the, nodes, in, some, philodendrons, the, cataphylls, build, up, over, time, and, eventually, form, a, wet, mass, at, the, nodes, this, may, keep, emerging, roots, moist, and, provide, some, form, of, lubrication, to, new, leaves, philodendrons, have, both, aerial, and, subterranean, roots, the, aerial, roots, occur, in, many, shapes, and, sizes, and, originate, from, most, of, the, plant, s, nodes, or, occasionally, from, an, internode, the, size, and, number, of, aerial, roots, per, node, depends, on, the, presence, of, a, suitable, substrate, for, the, roots, to, attach, themselves, aerial, roots, serve, two, primary, purposes, they, allow, the, philodendron, to, attach, itself, to, a, tree, or, other, plant, and, they, allow, it, to, collect, water, and, nutrients, as, such, the, roots, are, divided, morphologically, into, these, two, categories, aerial, roots, used, for, attaching, to, trees, tend, to, be, shorter, more, numerous, and, sometimes, have, a, layer, of, root, hairs, attached, those, used, for, collecting, water, and, nutrients, tend, to, be, thicker, and, longer, these, feeder, roots, tend, to, attach, flush, with, the, substrate, to, which, the, philodendron, is, attached, and, make, their, way, directly, downwards, in, search, of, soil, in, general, feeder, roots, tend, to, show, both, positive, hydrotropic, and, negative, heliotropic, behaviors, characteristic, of, roots, in, philodendrons, is, the, presence, of, a, sclerotic, hypodermis, which, are, cylindrical, tubes, inside, the, epidermis, that, can, be, one, to, five, cells, long, the, cells, that, line, the, sclerotic, hypodermis, are, elongated, and, tend, to, be, hardened, underneath, the, epidermis, is, a, unique, layer, of, cells, in, a, pattern, of, long, cells, followed, by, short, cells, some, philodendrons, have, extrafloral, nectaries, nectar, producing, glands, found, outside, of, the, flowers, the, nectar, attracts, ants, with, which, the, plant, enjoys, a, protective, symbiotic, relationship, nectaries, can, be, found, in, a, variety, of, locations, on, the, plant, including, the, stalks, sheaths, lower, surfaces, of, the, leaves, and, spathes, the, nectaries, produce, a, sweet, sticky, substance, the, ants, like, to, eat, and, which, provides, an, incentive, for, them, to, build, their, nests, amongst, the, roots, of, the, given, philodendron, in, some, cases, the, amount, of, nectar, produced, can, be, quite, extensive, resulting, in, the, surface, becoming, entirely, covered, with, it, when, philodendrons, are, ready, to, reproduce, they, will, produce, an, inflorescence, which, consists, of, a, leaf, like, hood, called, a, spathe, within, which, is, enclosed, a, tube, like, structure, called, a, spadix, depending, on, the, species, a, single, inflorescence, can, be, produced, or, a, cluster, of, up, to, 11, inflorescences, can, be, produced, at, a, single, time, on, short, peduncles, the, spathe, tends, to, be, waxy, and, is, usually, bicolored, in, some, philodendrons, the, color, of, the, base, of, the, spathe, contrasts, in, color, with, the, upper, part, and, in, others, the, inner, and, outer, surfaces, of, the, spathe, differ, in, coloration, the, paler, color, tends, to, be, either, white, or, green, and, the, darker, usually, red, or, crimson, pelargonidin, is, the, predominant, pigment, causing, the, red, coloration, in, the, spathes, the, upper, portion, of, the, spathe, is, called, the, limb, or, blade, while, the, lower, portion, is, called, the, convolute, tube, or, chamber, due, to, its, tubular, structure, at, the, base, the, spadix, is, more, often, than, not, white, and, shorter, than, the, spathe, on, the, spadix, are, found, fertile, female, fertile, male, and, sterile, male, flowers, the, fertile, male, and, female, flowers, are, separated, on, the, spadix, by, a, sterile, zone, or, staminodal, region, composed, of, sterile, male, flowers, this, barrier, of, sterile, male, flowers, ensures, fertile, male, flowers, do, not, fertilize, the, female, flowers, the, arrangement, tends, to, be, vertical, with, fertile, male, flowers, at, the, top, of, the, spadix, followed, by, sterile, male, flowers, and, fertile, female, flowers, very, close, to, the, bottom, in, the, region, known, as, the, spathe, tube, or, chamber, in, some, philodendrons, an, additional, region, of, sterile, male, flowers, is, found, at, the, very, top, of, the, spadix, the, fertile, female, flowers, are, often, not, receptive, to, fertilization, when, the, fertile, males, are, producing, pollen, which, again, prevents, self, pollination, the, pollen, itself, is, thread, like, and, appears, to, project, out, from, the, region, where, the, fertile, male, flowers, are, located, sexual, reproduction, is, achieved, by, means, of, beetles, with, many, philodendron, species, requiring, the, presence, of, a, specific, beetle, species, to, achieve, pollination, the, reverse, is, not, always, the, case, as, many, beetle, species, will, pollinate, more, than, one, philodendron, species, these, same, beetles, could, also, pollinate, other, genera, outside, of, philodendron, as, well, as, outside, of, the, family, araceae, the, pollinating, beetles, are, males, and, members, of, the, subfamily, rutelinae, and, dynastinae, and, to, date, the, only, beetles, seen, to, pollinate, the, inflorescence, are, in, the, genera, cyclocephala, or, erioscelis, other, smaller, types, of, beetles, in, the, genus, neelia, visit, the, inflorescences, as, well, but, they, are, not, believed, to, be, involved, in, pollinating, philodendrons, to, attract, the, beetles, the, sterile, male, flowers, give, off, pheromones, to, attract, the, male, beetles, usually, at, dusk, this, process, female, anthesis, is, followed, by, male, anthesis, in, which, the, pollen, is, produced, female, anthesis, typically, lasts, up, to, two, days, and, includes, the, gradual, opening, of, the, spathe, to, allow, the, beetles, to, enter, some, evidence, suggests, the, timing, of, opening, of, the, spathe, is, dependent, on, light, levels, where, cloudy, darker, days, result, in, the, spathe, opening, up, earlier, than, on, clear, days, during, female, anthesis, the, spadix, will, project, forward, at, roughly, 45, relative, to, the, spathe, the, spathe, provides, a, safe, breeding, area, for, the, beetles, as, such, the, male, beetles, are, often, followed, by, female, beetles, with, the, intent, of, mating, with, the, males, within, the, spathe, the, philodendrons, benefit, from, this, symbiotic, relationship, because, the, males, will, eventually, leave, the, spathe, covered, in, pollen, and, repeat, the, process, at, another, philodendron, pollinating, it, in, the, process, and, thus, providing, philodendrons, a, means, of, sexual, reproduction, in, addition, to, gaining, a, safe, location, to, mate, the, male, beetles, may, benefit, from, having, a, central, location, because, it, allows, them, to, broadcast, to, females, that, they, are, willing, and, able, to, mate, females, which, see, a, male, beetle, headed, for, a, philodendron, flower, know, he, does, so, with, intention, of, mating, and, females, which, are, sexually, receptive, and, need, to, mate, know, that, they, can, find, males, if, they, follow, the, pheromones, produced, by, the, philodendron, flowers, as, a, result, the, male, beetles, benefit, from, this, relationship, with, the, philodendrons, because, they, do, not, have, to, produce, pheromones, to, attract, females, since, the, philodendrons, do, it, for, them, additionally, male, beetles, benefit, because, they, are, ensured, of, mating, with, only, sexually, receptive, females, which, is, not, necessarily, certain, otherwise, in, doing, so, the, philodendron, provides, male, beetles, a, more, efficient, way, to, find, females, than, what, they, could, achieve, on, their, own, pheromones, produced, by, the, philodendrons, may, be, similar, to, those, produced, by, female, beetles, when, they, wish, to, attract, males, to, mate, also, the, pheromones, have, a, sweet, fruity, smell, in, many, species, and, no, noticeable, smell, for, others, not, all, beetle, behavior, directly, benefits, the, philodendrons, in, this, symbiosis, in, addition, to, the, reproductive, benefits, to, beetles, the, philodendrons, provide, food, in, two, forms, pollen, from, the, fertile, male, flowers, is, eaten, by, the, beetles, throughout, the, night, secondly, the, sterile, male, flowers, consumed, by, the, beetles, are, rich, in, lipids, the, male, beetles, will, stay, overnight, in, the, spathe, eating, and, mating, throughout, the, night, due, to, the, benefits, provided, by, the, spathe, and, spadix, typically, five, to, 12, beetles, will, be, within, the, spathe, throughout, the, night, rarely, cases, of, 200, beetles, at, a, time, have, been, observed, and, almost, always, the, beetles, are, of, the, same, species, another, feature, of, this, symbiotic, relationship, less, well, understood, is, the, series, of, events, in, which, the, spadix, begins, to, heat, up, prior, to, the, spathe, opening, up, for, the, beetles, this, process, is, known, as, thermogenesis, by, the, time, the, spathe, is, open, and, the, beetles, have, arrived, the, spadix, is, usually, quite, hot, up, to, around, 46, c, in, some, species, but, usually, around, 35, c, the, thermogenesis, coincides, with, the, arrival, of, the, beetles, and, appears, to, increase, their, presence, the, maximum, temperature, reached, by, the, spadix, remains, about, 20, c, higher, than, the, outside, ambient, temperature, the, time, dependence, of, the, temperature, can, vary, from, species, to, species, in, some, species, the, temperature, of, the, spadix, will, peak, on, the, arrival, of, the, beetles, then, decrease, and, finally, increase, reaching, a, maximum, once, again, when, the, philodendron, is, ready, for, the, beetles, to, leave, other, species, though, only, show, a, maximum, temperature, on, the, arrival, of, the, beetles, which, remains, roughly, constant, for, about, a, day, and, then, steadily, decreases, a, few, species, will, show, three, peaks, in, temperature, during, the, flowering, the, increased, temperature, increases, the, metabolism, of, the, beetles, causing, them, to, move, about, more, within, the, spathe, and, increasing, the, likelihood, they, will, be, sufficiently, coated, with, pollen, a, sticky, resin, is, also, produced, in, drops, attached, to, the, spadix, which, help, to, keep, the, pollen, attached, to, the, beetles, this, resin, producing, quality, is, unique, to, philodendron, and, monstera, as, other, genera, of, araceae, do, not, produce, it, on, their, spadices, the, resin, is, also, found, on, the, stems, leaves, and, roots, of, philodendrons, its, color, can, be, red, orange, yellow, or, colorless, when, it, is, first, produced, yet, over, time, it, will, turn, brown, as, it, is, exposed, to, air, also, some, evidence, suggests, the, thermogenesis, triggers, the, beetles, to, mate, it, also, appears, to, distribute, the, pheromones, into, the, air, the, reason, for, the, spadix, being, held, at, 45, relative, to, the, spathe, may, be, to, maximize, the, heat, s, ability, to, waft, the, pheromones, into, the, air, oxidizing, stored, carbohydrates, and, lipids, has, been, found, to, be, the, energy, source, for, thermogenesis, the, part, of, the, spadix, that, heats, up, is, the, sterile, zone, as, it, heats, up, carbohydrates, are, used, but, once, the, spadix, has, reached, its, maximum, temperature, lipids, are, oxidized, the, lipids, are, not, first, converted, to, carbohydrates, but, rather, are, directly, oxidized, the, thermogenic, reaction, is, triggered, when, concentrations, of, acetosalicytic, acid, form, in, the, sterile, zone, the, acid, sets, off, the, mitochondria, in, the, cells, that, make, up, the, sterile, zone, to, switch, to, an, electron, transport, chain, called, the, cyanide, resistant, pathway, which, results, in, the, production, of, heat, philodendrons, consume, oxygen, during, thermogenesis, the, rate, at, which, oxygen, is, used, is, remarkably, high, close, to, that, of, hummingbirds, and, sphinx, moths, the, spadix, has, been, shown, to, generate, infrared, radiation, as, the, beetles, home, in, on, the, inflorescence, they, first, move, in, a, zig, zag, pattern, until, they, get, reasonably, close, when, they, switch, to, a, straight, line, path, the, beetles, may, be, using, scent, to, find, the, inflorescence, when, they, are, far, away, but, once, within, range, they, find, it, by, means, of, the, infrared, radiation, this, would, account, for, the, two, different, types, of, paths, the, beetles, follow, once, female, anthesis, is, nearing, its, end, and, the, female, flowers, have, been, pollinated, the, spathe, will, be, fully, open, and, male, anthesis, begins, in, the, beginning, of, male, anthesis, the, fertile, male, flowers, complete, the, process, of, producing, the, pollen, and, the, female, flowers, become, unreceptive, to, further, pollination, additionally, the, spadix, moves, from, its, 45, position, and, presses, up, flush, to, the, spathe, towards, the, end, of, male, anthesis, the, spathe, begins, to, close, from, the, bottom, working, its, way, up, and, forcing, the, beetles, to, move, up, and, across, the, upper, region, of, the, spathe, where, the, fertile, male, flowers, are, located, in, doing, so, the, philodendron, controls, when, the, beetles, come, and, when, they, leave, and, forces, them, to, rub, against, the, top, of, the, spadix, where, the, pollen, is, located, as, they, exit, thus, ensuring, they, are, well, coated, with, pollen, one, would, expect, the, beetles, to, stay, indefinitely, if, they, could, due, to, the, very, favorable, conditions, the, inflorescence, provides, after, male, anthesis, the, males, will, go, off, and, find, another, philodendron, undergoing, female, anthesis, so, will, pollinate, the, female, flowers, with, the, pollen, it, had, collected, from, its, previous, night, of, mating, botanically, the, fruit, produced, is, a, berry, the, berries, develop, later, in, the, season, berry, development, time, varies, from, species, to, species, from, a, few, weeks, to, a, year, although, most, philodendrons, take, a, few, months, the, spathe, will, enlarge, to, hold, the, maturing, berries, once, the, fruit, are, mature, the, spathe, will, begin, to, open, again, but, this, time, it, will, break, off, at, the, base, and, fall, to, the, forest, floor, additionally, the, berries, are, edible, although, they, contain, calcium, oxalate, crystals, and, have, a, taste, akin, to, bananas, many, botanical, sources, will, indicate, that, the, berries, are, poisonous, probably, due, to, the, oxalate, crystals, many, tropical, plants, contain, oxalates, in, varying, amounts, sometimes, proper, preparation, can, render, these, harmless, and, in, many, cases, eating, minor, amounts, causes, most, people, no, distress, or, minor, gastric, irritation, however, care, should, be, taken, to, verify, the, toxicity, of, any, particular, species, before, ingesting, these, berries, particularly, regularly, or, in, large, amounts, the, color, of, the, berries, can, vary, depending, on, the, species, but, most, produce, a, white, berry, with, slight, tones, of, green, some, produce, orange, berries, and, others, yellow, berries, though, still, others, will, produce, berries, that, start, off, white, but, then, change, to, another, color, with, time, philodendrons, that, produce, orange, berries, tend, to, be, members, of, the, section, calostigma, contained, within, the, berries, are, the, seeds, which, are, extremely, small, compared, to, other, members, of, the, family, araceae, the, berries, often, give, off, odors, to, attract, animals, to, eat, and, disperse, them, for, example, philodendron, alliodorum, berries, are, known, to, emit, an, odor, similar, to, that, of, garlic, the, animals, that, distribute, the, seeds, depends, on, the, species, but, some, possible, dispersers, include, bats, and, monkeys, insects, also, may, be, responsible, for, dispersing, seeds, as, beetles, and, wasps, have, been, seen, feeding, on, philodendron, berries, eurytomid, wasps, also, seek, out, philodendrons, and, are, known, to, lay, their, eggs, in, the, ovaries, of, many, philodendron, species, resulting, in, galled, inflorescences, philodendrons, exhibit, extremely, few, physical, reproductive, barriers, to, prevent, hybridization, but, very, few, natural, hybrids, are, found, in, nature, this, may, be, because, philodendrons, have, many, geographic, and, time, barriers, to, prevent, any, such, cross, pollination, for, example, it, is, rare, for, more, than, one, philodendron, species, to, be, flowering, at, the, same, time, or, to, be, pollinated, by, the, same, species, of, beetles, the, beetles, have, also, been, observed, to, be, selective, to, the, height, of, the, plant, they, pollinate, which, would, serve, as, an, additional, preventive, measure, to, make, hybrids, less, likely, because, of, these, outside, barriers, philodendrons, may, not, have, had, to, evolve, physical, mechanisms, to, prevent, cross, pollination, hybrids, in, nature, are, only, rarely, reported, when, found, these, hybrids, often, can, show, remarkable, genetic, relationships, crosses, between, two, philodendrons, in, different, sections, can, occur, successfully, philodendrons, are, known, to, have, been, collected, from, the, wild, as, early, as, 1644, by, georg, marcgraf, but, the, first, partly, successful, scientific, attempt, to, collect, and, classify, the, genus, was, done, by, charles, plumier, plumier, collected, approximately, six, species, from, the, islands, of, martinique, hispaniola, and, st, thomas, since, then, many, exploration, attempts, have, been, made, to, collect, new, species, by, others, these, include, those, by, n, j, jacquin, who, collected, new, species, in, the, west, indies, colombia, and, venezuela, at, this, time, in, history, the, names, of, the, philodendrons, they, were, discovering, were, being, published, with, the, genus, name, arum, since, most, aroids, were, considered, to, belong, to, this, same, genus, the, genus, philodendron, had, not, yet, been, created, throughout, the, late, 17th, 18th, century, and, early, 19th, centuries, many, plants, were, removed, from, the, genus, arum, and, placed, into, newly, created, genera, in, an, attempt, to, improve, the, classification, heinrich, wilhelm, schott, addressed, the, problem, of, providing, improved, taxonomy, and, created, the, genus, philodendron, and, described, it, in, 1829, the, genus, was, first, spelled, as, philodendrum, but, in, 1832, schott, published, a, system, for, classifying, plants, in, the, family, araceae, titled, meletemata, botanica, in, which, he, provided, a, method, of, classifying, philodendrons, based, on, flowering, characteristics, in, 1856, schott, published, a, revision, of, his, previous, work, titled, synopsis, aroidearum, and, then, published, his, final, work, prodromus, systematis, aroidearum, in, 1860, in, which, he, provided, even, more, details, about, the, classification, of, philodendron, and, described, 135, species, philodendron, are, usually, extremely, distinctive, and, not, usually, confused, with, other, genera, although, a, few, exceptions, in, the, genera, anthurium, and, homalomena, resemble, philodendron, the, genus, philodendron, has, been, subdivided, into, three, subgenera, meconostigma, pteromischum, and, philodendron, in, 2018, it, was, proposed, that, philodendron, subg, meconostigma, be, recognized, as, a, separate, genus, thaumatophyllum, the, genus, philodendron, can, also, be, subdivided, into, several, sections, and, subsections, section, baursia, section, philopsammos, section, philodendron, subsections, achyropodium, canniphyllium, macrolonchium, philodendron, platypodium, psoropodium, and, solenosterigma, section, calostigma, subsections, bulaoana, eucardium, glossophyllum, macrobelium, and, oligocarpidium, section, tritomophyllum, section, schizophyllum, section, polytomium, section, macrogynium, and, section, camptogynium, typically, the, inflorescence, is, of, great, importance, in, determining, the, species, of, a, given, philodendron, since, it, tends, to, be, less, variable, than, the, leaves, the, genus, philodendron, could, be, classified, further, by, means, of, differentiating, them, based, on, the, pattern, of, thermogenesis, observed, although, this, is, not, currently, used, philodendron, diverged, from, adelonema, and, diversified, during, the, late, oligocene, c, 25, million, years, ago, in, the, new, world, philodendron, species, can, be, found, in, many, diverse, habitats, in, the, tropical, americas, and, the, west, indies, most, occur, in, humid, tropical, forests, but, can, also, be, found, in, swamps, and, on, river, banks, roadsides, and, rock, outcrops, they, are, also, found, throughout, the, diverse, range, of, elevations, from, sea, level, to, over, 2000, m, above, sea, level, species, of, this, genus, are, often, found, clambering, over, other, plants, or, climbing, the, trunks, of, trees, with, the, aid, of, aerial, roots, philodendrons, usually, distinguish, themselves, in, their, environment, by, their, large, numbers, compared, to, other, plants, making, them, a, highly, noticeable, component, of, the, ecosystems, in, which, they, are, found, they, are, found, in, great, numbers, in, road, clearings, philodendrons, can, also, be, found, in, australia, some, pacific, islands, africa, and, asia, although, they, are, not, indigenous, and, were, introduced, or, accidentally, escaped, philodendrons, can, be, grown, outdoors, in, mild, climates, in, shady, spots, they, thrive, in, moist, soils, with, high, organic, matter, in, milder, climates, they, can, be, grown, in, pots, of, soil, or, in, the, case, of, philodendron, oxycardium, in, containers, of, water, indoor, plants, thrive, at, temperatures, between, 15, and, 18, c, and, can, survive, at, lower, light, levels, than, other, house, plants, although, philodendrons, can, survive, in, dark, places, they, much, prefer, bright, lights, wiping, the, leaves, off, with, water, will, remove, any, dust, and, insects, plants, in, pots, with, good, root, systems, will, benefit, from, a, weak, fertilizer, solution, every, other, week, new, plants, can, be, grown, by, taking, stem, cuttings, with, at, least, two, joints, cuttings, then, can, be, rooted, in, pots, of, sand, and, peat, moss, mixtures, these, pots, are, placed, in, greenhouses, with, bottom, heat, of, 21, 24, c, during, the, rooting, cuttings, should, be, kept, out, of, direct, sunlight, once, rooted, the, plants, can, be, transplanted, to, larger, pots, or, directly, outside, in, milder, climates, stem, cuttings, particularly, from, trailing, varieties, can, be, rooted, in, water, in, four, to, five, weeks, the, plant, should, develop, roots, and, can, be, transferred, to, pots, philodendrons, can, also, propagate, through, air, layering, which, is, a, more, advanced, method, of, propagation, that, involves, creating, a, new, plant, on, the, stem, of, an, existing, plant, hybridizing, philodendrons, is, quite, easy, if, flowering, plants, are, available, because, they, have, very, few, barriers, to, prevent, hybridization, however, some, aspects, of, making, crosses, can, make, philodendron, hybridization, more, difficult, philodendrons, often, flower, at, different, times, and, the, time, when, the, spathe, opens, up, varies, from, plant, to, plant, the, pollen, and, the, inflorescence, both, have, short, lives, which, means, a, large, collection, of, philodendrons, is, necessary, if, crossbreeding, is, to, be, done, successfully, the, pollen, life, can, be, extended, to, a, few, weeks, by, storing, it, in, film, canisters, in, a, refrigerator, artificial, pollination, is, usually, achieved, by, first, mixing, the, pollen, with, water, a, window, is, then, cut, into, the, spathe, and, the, water, pollen, mixture, is, rubbed, on, the, fertile, female, flowers, the, entire, spathe, is, then, covered, in, a, plastic, bag, so, the, water, pollen, mixture, does, not, dry, out, the, bag, is, removed, a, few, days, later, if, the, inflorescence, has, not, been, fertilized, it, will, fall, off, usually, within, a, few, weeks, the, resins, produced, during, the, flowering, of, monstera, and, philodendron, are, known, to, be, used, by, trigona, bees, in, the, construction, of, their, nests, indigenous, people, from, south, america, use, the, resin, from, the, bees, nests, to, make, their, blowguns, air, and, watertight, though, they, contain, calcium, oxalate, crystals, the, berries, of, some, species, are, eaten, by, the, locals, for, example, the, sweet, white, berries, of, thaumatophyllum, bipinnatifidum, are, known, to, be, used, additionally, the, aerial, roots, are, also, used, for, rope, in, this, particular, species, the, leaves, of, philodendrons, are, also, known, to, be, eaten, by, venezuelan, red, howler, monkeys, making, up, 3, 1, of, all, the, leaves, they, eat, also, in, the, making, of, a, particular, recipe, for, curare, by, the, amazonian, taiwanos, the, leaves, and, stems, of, an, unknown, philodendron, species, are, used, the, leaves, and, stems, are, mixed, with, the, bark, of, vochysia, ferruginea, and, with, some, parts, of, a, species, in, the, genus, strychnos, yet, another, use, of, philodendrons, is, for, catching, fish, a, tribe, in, the, colombian, amazon, is, known, to, use, philodendron, craspedodromum, to, add, poison, to, the, water, temporarily, stunning, the, fish, which, rise, up, to, the, surface, where, they, can, be, easily, scooped, up, to, add, the, poison, to, the, water, the, leaves, are, cut, into, pieces, and, tied, together, to, form, bundles, which, are, allowed, to, ferment, for, a, few, days, the, bundles, are, crushed, and, added, to, the, water, into, which, the, poison, will, dissipate, although, the, toxicity, of, philodendron, craspedodromum, is, not, fully, known, active, ingredients, in, the, poisoning, of, the, fish, possibly, are, coumarins, formed, during, the, fermentation, process, some, philodendrons, are, also, used, for, ceremonial, purposes, among, the, kubeo, tribe, native, to, colombia, philodendron, insigne, is, used, by, witch, doctors, to, treat, ill, patients, they, use, the, juice, of, the, spathe, to, stain, their, hands, red, since, many, such, tribes, view, the, color, red, as, a, sign, of, power, philodendrons, can, contain, as, much, as, 0, 7, of, oxalates, in, the, form, of, calcium, oxalate, crystals, as, raphides, the, risk, of, death, if, even, possible, is, extremely, low, if, ingested, by, an, average, adult, although, its, consumption, is, generally, considered, unhealthy, in, general, the, calcium, oxalate, crystals, have, a, very, mild, effect, on, humans, and, large, quantities, have, to, be, consumed, for, symptoms, to, even, appear, possible, symptoms, include, increased, salivation, a, sensation, of, burning, of, the, mouth, swelling, of, the, tongue, stomatitis, dysphagia, an, inability, to, speak, and, edema, cases, of, mild, dermatitis, due, to, contact, with, the, leaves, have, also, been, reported, with, symptoms, including, vesiculation, and, erythema, the, chemical, derivatives, of, alkenyl, resorcinol, are, believed, to, be, responsible, for, the, dermatitis, in, some, people, contact, with, philodendron, oils, or, fluids, with, the, eyes, have, also, been, known, to, result, in, conjunctivitis, fatal, poisonings, are, extremely, rare, one, case, of, an, infant, eating, small, quantities, of, a, philodendron, resulting, in, hospitalization, and, death, has, been, reported, this, one, case, study, however, was, found, to, be, inconsistent, with, the, findings, from, a, second, study, in, this, study, 127, cases, of, children, ingesting, philodendrons, were, studied, and, they, found, only, one, child, showed, symptoms, a, 10, month, old, had, minor, upper, lip, swelling, when, he, chewed, on, a, philodendron, leaf, the, study, also, found, the, symptoms, could, subside, without, treatment, and, that, previously, reported, cases, of, severe, complications, were, exaggerated, as, to, the, toxicity, of, philodendrons, in, cats, the, evidence, is, conflicting, in, one, study, 72, cases, of, cat, poisonings, were, examined, of, which, 37, resulted, in, the, death, of, the, cat, the, symptoms, of, the, poisoned, cats, included, excitability, spasms, seizures, kidney, failure, and, encephalitis, however, in, another, study, three, cats, were, tube, fed, philodendron, cordatum, and, showed, no, signs, of, acute, poisoning, in, this, study, two, adult, cats, and, one, kitten, were, fed, a, pur, ed, leaf, and, water, mixture, observed, afterward, then, euthanized, and, finally, a, necropsy, was, performed, dosages, of, 2, 8, 5, 6, and, 9, 1, g, kg, were, used, with, the, highest, dose, administered, being, considerably, more, than, any, house, cat, could, consume, the, cats, showed, none, of, the, symptoms, found, in, past, epidemiological, studies, and, appeared, normal, necropsies, showed, nothing, that, would, suggest, toxicity, the, past, epidemiological, studies, have, been, suggested, to, be, wrong, since, sick, cats, may, be, inclined, to, eat, plants, to, alleviate, their, illnesses, if, this, were, the, case, then, such, studies, would, be, incorrectly, attributing, the, sickness, of, the, cats, to, the, philodendrons, the, forced, feeding, study, may, have, failed, to, show, signs, of, philodendron, toxicity, because, the, tube, feeding, bypassed, the, mouth, and, hence, minimized, the, typical, signs, of, irritation, some, philodendrons, are, however, known, to, be, toxic, to, mice, and, rats, in, one, study, 100, mg, of, philodendron, cordatum, leaves, suspended, in, distilled, water, were, fed, to, six, mice, three, of, the, mice, died, the, same, experiment, was, done, with, 100, mg, of, p, cordatum, stems, on, three, mice, and, none, of, them, died, leaves, and, flowers, of, philodendron, sagittifolium, were, also, orally, administered, in, 100, mg, doses, to, the, mice, three, mice, were, used, for, each, of, the, leaves, and, flowers, none, of, the, mice, died, a, similar, experiment, was, done, on, rats, with, the, leaves, and, stems, of, p, cordatum, but, instead, of, oral, administration, of, the, dose, it, was, injected, intraperitoneally, using, 3, g, of, plant, extract, from, either, the, leaves, or, stems, six, rats, were, injected, with, the, leaf, extract, and, five, of, them, died, eight, rats, were, injected, with, the, stem, extract, and, two, of, them, died
