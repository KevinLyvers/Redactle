includes, modern, humans, paranthropus, and, kenyanthropus, evolved, from, some, australopithecus, species, australopithecus, is, a, member, of, the, subtribe, australopithecina, which, sometimes, also, includes, ardipithecus, though, the, term, australopithecine, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, only, to, members, of, australopithecus, species, include, a, garhi, a, africanus, a, sediba, a, afarensis, a, anamensis, a, bahrelghazali, and, a, deyiremeda, debate, exists, as, to, whether, some, australopithecus, species, should, be, reclassified, into, new, genera, or, if, paranthropus, and, kenyanthropus, are, synonymous, with, australopithecus, in, part, because, of, the, taxonomic, inconsistency, furthermore, because, e, g, a, africanus, is, more, closely, related, to, for, instance, humans, or, their, ancestors, at, the, time, than, e, g, a, anamensis, and, many, more, australopithecus, branches, australopithecus, cannot, be, consolidated, into, a, coherent, grouping, without, also, including, the, homo, genus, and, other, genera, the, earliest, known, member, of, the, genus, a, anamensis, existed, in, eastern, africa, around, 4, 2, million, years, ago, australopithecus, fossils, become, more, widely, dispersed, throughout, eastern, and, southern, africa, the, chadian, a, bahrelghazali, indicates, the, genus, was, much, more, widespread, than, the, fossil, record, suggests, before, eventually, becoming, pseudo, extinct, 1, 9, million, years, ago, or, 1, 2, to, 0, 6, million, years, ago, if, paranthropus, is, included, while, none, of, the, groups, normally, directly, assigned, to, this, group, survived, australopithecus, gave, rise, to, living, descendants, as, the, genus, homo, emerged, from, an, australopithecus, species, at, some, time, between, 3, and, 2, million, years, ago, australopithecus, possessed, two, of, three, duplicated, genes, derived, from, srgap2, roughly, 3, 4, and, 2, 4, million, years, ago, srgap2b, and, srgap2c, the, second, of, which, contributed, to, the, increase, in, number, and, migration, of, neurons, in, the, human, brain, significant, changes, to, the, hand, first, appear, in, the, fossil, record, of, later, a, afarensis, about, 3, million, years, ago, fingers, shortened, relative, to, thumb, and, changes, to, the, joints, between, the, index, finger, and, the, trapezium, and, capitate, the, first, australopithecus, specimen, the, type, specimen, was, discovered, in, 1924, in, a, lime, quarry, by, workers, at, taung, south, africa, the, specimen, was, studied, by, the, australian, anatomist, raymond, dart, who, was, then, working, at, the, university, of, the, witwatersrand, in, johannesburg, the, fossil, skull, was, from, a, three, year, old, bipedal, primate, nicknamed, taung, child, that, he, named, australopithecus, africanus, the, first, report, was, published, in, nature, in, february, 1925, dart, realised, that, the, fossil, contained, a, number, of, humanoid, features, and, so, he, came, to, the, conclusion, that, this, was, an, early, human, ancestor, later, scottish, paleontologist, robert, broom, and, dart, set, out, to, search, for, more, early, hominin, specimens, and, several, more, a, africanus, remains, from, various, sites, initially, anthropologists, were, largely, hostile, to, the, idea, that, these, discoveries, were, anything, but, apes, though, this, changed, during, the, late, 1940s, in, 1950, evolutionary, biologist, ernst, walter, mayr, said, that, all, bipedal, apes, should, be, classified, into, the, genus, homo, and, considered, renaming, australopithecus, to, homo, transvaalensis, however, the, contrary, view, taken, by, robinson, in, 1954, excluding, australopiths, from, homo, became, the, prevalent, view, the, first, australopithecine, fossil, discovered, in, eastern, africa, was, an, a, boisei, skull, excavated, by, mary, leakey, in, 1959, in, olduvai, gorge, tanzania, since, then, the, leakey, family, has, continued, to, excavate, the, gorge, uncovering, further, evidence, for, australopithecines, as, well, as, for, homo, habilis, and, homo, erectus, the, scientific, community, took, 20, more, years, to, widely, accept, australopithecus, as, a, member, of, the, human, family, tree, in, 1997, an, almost, complete, australopithecus, skeleton, with, skull, was, found, in, the, sterkfontein, caves, of, gauteng, south, africa, it, is, now, called, little, foot, and, it, is, around, 3, 7, million, years, old, it, was, named, australopithecus, prometheus, which, has, since, been, placed, within, a, africanus, other, fossil, remains, found, in, the, same, cave, in, 2008, were, named, australopithecus, sediba, which, lived, 1, 9, million, years, ago, a, africanus, probably, evolved, into, a, sediba, which, some, scientists, think, may, have, evolved, into, h, erectus, though, this, is, heavily, disputed, in, 2003, spanish, writer, camilo, jos, cela, conde, and, evolutionary, biologist, francisco, j, ayala, proposed, resurrecting, the, genus, praeanthropus, to, house, orrorin, a, afarensis, a, anamensis, a, bahrelghazali, and, a, garhi, but, this, genus, has, been, largely, dismissed, with, the, apparent, emergence, of, the, genera, homo, kenyanthropus, and, paranthropus, in, the, genus, australopithecus, taxonomy, runs, into, some, difficulty, as, the, name, of, species, incorporates, their, genus, according, to, cladistics, groups, should, not, be, left, paraphyletic, where, it, is, kept, not, consisting, of, a, common, ancestor, and, all, of, its, descendants, resolving, this, problem, would, cause, major, ramifications, in, the, nomenclature, of, all, descendent, species, possibilities, suggested, have, been, to, rename, homo, sapiens, to, australopithecus, sapiens, or, even, pan, sapiens, or, to, move, some, australopithecus, species, into, new, genera, in, 2002, and, again, in, 2007, camilo, jos, cela, conde, et, al, suggested, that, a, africanus, be, moved, to, paranthropus, on, the, basis, of, craniodental, evidence, strait, and, grine, 2004, suggest, that, a, anamensis, and, a, garhi, should, be, assigned, to, new, genera, it, is, debated, whether, or, not, a, bahrelghazali, should, be, considered, simply, a, western, variant, of, a, afarensis, instead, of, a, separate, species, a, anamensis, may, have, descended, from, or, was, closely, related, to, ardipithecus, ramidus, a, anamensis, shows, some, similarities, to, both, ar, ramidus, and, sahelanthropus, australopiths, shared, several, traits, with, modern, apes, and, humans, and, were, widespread, throughout, eastern, and, northern, africa, by, 3, 5, million, years, ago, mya, the, earliest, evidence, of, fundamentally, bipedal, hominins, is, a, 3, 6, mya, fossil, trackway, in, laetoli, tanzania, which, bears, a, remarkable, similarity, to, those, of, modern, humans, the, footprints, have, generally, been, classified, as, australopith, as, they, are, the, only, form, of, prehuman, hominins, known, to, have, existed, in, that, region, at, that, time, according, to, the, chimpanzee, genome, project, the, human, chimpanzee, last, common, ancestor, existed, about, five, to, six, million, years, ago, assuming, a, constant, rate, of, mutation, however, hominin, species, dated, to, earlier, than, the, date, could, call, this, into, question, sahelanthropus, tchadensis, commonly, called, toumai, is, about, seven, million, years, old, and, orrorin, tugenensis, lived, at, least, six, million, years, ago, since, little, is, known, of, them, they, remain, controversial, among, scientists, since, the, molecular, clock, in, humans, has, determined, that, humans, and, chimpanzees, had, a, genetic, split, at, least, a, million, years, later, one, theory, suggests, that, the, human, and, chimpanzee, lineages, diverged, somewhat, at, first, then, some, populations, interbred, around, one, million, years, after, diverging, the, brains, of, most, species, of, australopithecus, were, roughly, 35, of, the, size, of, a, modern, human, brain, with, an, endocranial, volume, average, of, 466, cc, 28, 4, cu, in, although, this, is, more, than, the, average, endocranial, volume, of, chimpanzee, brains, at, 360, cc, 22, cu, in, the, earliest, australopiths, a, anamensis, appear, to, have, been, within, the, chimpanzee, range, whereas, some, later, australopith, specimens, have, a, larger, endocranial, volume, than, that, of, some, early, homo, fossils, most, species, of, australopithecus, were, diminutive, and, gracile, usually, standing, 1, 2, to, 1, 4, m, 3, ft, 11, in, to, 4, ft, 7, in, tall, it, is, possible, that, they, exhibited, a, considerable, degree, of, sexual, dimorphism, males, being, larger, than, females, in, modern, populations, males, are, on, average, a, mere, 15, larger, than, females, while, in, australopithecus, males, could, be, up, to, 50, larger, than, females, by, some, estimates, however, the, degree, of, sexual, dimorphism, is, debated, due, to, the, fragmentary, nature, of, australopith, remains, one, paper, finds, that, a, afarensis, had, a, level, of, dimorphism, close, to, modern, humans, according, to, a, zihlman, australopithecus, body, proportions, closely, resemble, those, of, bonobos, pan, paniscus, leading, evolutionary, biologist, jeremy, griffith, to, suggest, that, bonobos, may, be, phenotypically, similar, to, australopithecus, furthermore, thermoregulatory, models, suggest, that, australopiths, were, fully, hair, covered, more, like, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, and, unlike, humans, the, fossil, record, seems, to, indicate, that, australopithecus, is, ancestral, to, homo, and, modern, humans, it, was, once, assumed, that, large, brain, size, had, been, a, precursor, to, bipedalism, but, the, discovery, of, australopithecus, with, a, small, brain, but, developed, bipedality, upset, this, theory, nonetheless, it, remains, a, matter, of, controversy, as, to, how, bipedalism, first, emerged, the, advantages, of, bipedalism, were, that, it, left, the, hands, free, to, grasp, objects, e, g, carry, food, and, young, and, allowed, the, eyes, to, look, over, tall, grasses, for, possible, food, sources, or, predators, but, it, is, also, argued, that, these, advantages, were, not, significant, enough, to, cause, the, emergence, of, bipedalism, earlier, fossils, such, as, orrorin, tugenensis, indicate, bipedalism, around, six, million, years, ago, around, the, time, of, the, split, between, humans, and, chimpanzees, indicated, by, genetic, studies, this, suggests, that, erect, straight, legged, walking, originated, as, an, adaptation, to, tree, dwelling, major, changes, to, the, pelvis, and, feet, had, already, taken, place, before, australopithecus, it, was, once, thought, that, humans, descended, from, a, knuckle, walking, ancestor, but, this, is, not, well, supported, australopithecines, have, thirty, two, teeth, like, modern, humans, their, molars, were, parallel, like, those, of, great, apes, and, they, had, a, slight, pre, canine, gap, diastema, their, canines, were, smaller, like, modern, humans, and, with, the, teeth, less, interlocked, than, in, previous, hominins, in, fact, in, some, australopithecines, the, canines, are, shaped, more, like, incisors, the, molars, of, australopithecus, fit, together, in, much, the, same, way, those, of, humans, do, with, low, crowns, and, four, low, rounded, cusps, used, for, crushing, they, have, cutting, edges, on, the, crests, however, australopiths, generally, evolved, a, larger, postcanine, dentition, with, thicker, enamel, australopiths, in, general, had, thick, enamel, like, homo, while, other, great, apes, have, markedly, thinner, enamel, robust, australopiths, wore, their, molar, surfaces, down, flat, unlike, the, more, gracile, species, who, kept, their, crests, australopithecus, species, are, thought, to, have, eaten, mainly, fruit, vegetables, and, tubers, and, perhaps, easy, to, catch, animals, such, as, small, lizards, much, research, has, focused, on, a, comparison, between, the, south, african, species, a, africanus, and, paranthropus, robustus, early, analyses, of, dental, microwear, in, these, two, species, showed, compared, to, p, robustus, a, africanus, had, fewer, microwear, features, and, more, scratches, as, opposed, to, pits, on, its, molar, wear, facets, microwear, patterns, on, the, cheek, teeth, of, a, afarensis, and, a, anamensis, indicate, that, a, afarensis, predominantly, ate, fruits, and, leaves, whereas, a, anamensis, included, grasses, and, seeds, in, addition, to, fruits, and, leaves, the, thickening, of, enamel, in, australopiths, may, have, been, a, response, to, eating, more, ground, bound, foods, such, as, tubers, nuts, and, cereal, grains, with, gritty, dirt, and, other, small, particulates, which, would, wear, away, enamel, gracile, australopiths, had, larger, incisors, which, indicates, tearing, food, was, important, perhaps, eating, scavenged, meat, nonetheless, the, wearing, patterns, on, the, teeth, support, a, largely, herbivorous, diet, in, 1992, trace, element, studies, of, the, strontium, calcium, ratios, in, robust, australopith, fossils, suggested, the, possibility, of, animal, consumption, as, they, did, in, 1994, using, stable, carbon, isotopic, analysis, in, 2005, fossil, animal, bones, with, butchery, marks, dating, to, 2, 6, million, years, old, were, found, at, the, site, of, gona, ethiopia, this, implies, meat, consumption, by, at, least, one, of, three, species, of, hominins, occurring, around, that, time, a, africanus, a, garhi, and, or, p, aethiopicus, in, 2010, fossils, of, butchered, animal, bones, dated, 3, 4, million, years, old, were, found, in, ethiopia, close, to, regions, where, australopith, fossils, were, found, robust, australopithecines, paranthropus, had, larger, cheek, teeth, than, gracile, australopiths, possibly, because, robust, australopithecines, had, more, tough, fibrous, plant, material, in, their, diets, whereas, gracile, australopiths, ate, more, hard, and, brittle, foods, however, such, divergence, in, chewing, adaptations, may, instead, have, been, a, response, to, fallback, food, availability, in, leaner, times, robust, and, gracile, australopithecines, may, have, turned, to, different, low, quality, foods, fibrous, plants, for, the, former, and, hard, food, for, the, latter, but, in, more, bountiful, times, they, had, more, variable, and, overlapping, diets, in, a, 1979, preliminary, microwear, study, of, australopithecus, fossil, teeth, anthropologist, alan, walker, theorized, that, robust, australopiths, ate, predominantly, fruit, frugivory, a, study, in, 2018, found, non, carious, cervical, lesions, caused, by, acid, erosion, on, the, teeth, of, a, africanus, probably, caused, by, consumption, of, acidic, fruit, it, is, debated, if, the, australopithecus, hand, was, anatomically, capable, of, producing, stone, tools, a, garhi, was, associated, with, large, mammal, bones, bearing, evidence, of, processing, by, stone, tools, which, may, indicate, australopithecine, tool, production, stone, tools, dating, to, roughly, the, same, time, as, a, garhi, about, 2, 6, mya, were, later, discovered, at, the, nearby, gona, and, ledi, geraru, sites, but, the, appearance, of, homo, at, ledi, geraru, ld, 350, 1, casts, doubt, on, australopithecine, authorship, in, 2010, cut, marks, dating, to, 3, 4, mya, on, a, bovid, leg, were, found, at, the, dikaka, site, which, were, at, first, attributed, to, butchery, by, a, afarensis, but, because, the, fossil, came, from, a, sandstone, unit, and, were, modified, by, abrasive, sand, and, gravel, particles, during, the, fossilisation, process, the, attribution, to, butchery, is, dubious, in, 2015, the, lomekwi, culture, was, discovered, at, lake, turkana, dating, to, 3, 3, mya, possibly, attributable, to, kenyanthropus, or, a, deyiremeda
