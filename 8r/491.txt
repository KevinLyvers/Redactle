herring, are, forage, fish, mostly, belonging, to, the, family, of, clupeidae, herring, often, move, in, large, schools, around, fishing, banks, and, near, the, coast, found, particularly, in, shallow, temperate, waters, of, the, north, pacific, and, north, atlantic, oceans, including, the, baltic, sea, as, well, as, off, the, west, coast, of, south, america, three, species, of, clupea, the, type, genus, of, the, herring, family, clupeidae, are, recognised, and, comprise, about, 90, of, all, herrings, captured, in, fisheries, the, most, abundant, of, these, species, is, the, atlantic, herring, which, comprises, over, half, of, all, herring, capture, fish, called, herring, are, also, found, in, the, arabian, sea, indian, ocean, and, bay, of, bengal, herring, played, an, important, role, in, the, history, of, marine, fisheries, in, europe, and, early, in, the, 20th, century, their, study, was, fundamental, to, the, development, of, fisheries, science, these, oily, fish, also, have, a, long, history, as, an, important, food, fish, and, are, often, salted, smoked, or, pickled, herring, were, also, known, as, silver, darlings, in, the, united, kingdom, a, number, of, different, species, most, belonging, to, the, family, clupeidae, are, commonly, referred, to, as, herrings, the, origins, of, the, term, herring, is, somewhat, unclear, though, it, may, derive, from, the, same, source, as, the, old, high, german, heri, meaning, a, host, multitude, in, reference, to, the, large, schools, they, form, the, type, genus, of, the, herring, family, clupeidae, is, clupea, clupea, contains, only, two, species, the, atlantic, herring, the, type, species, found, in, the, north, atlantic, and, the, pacific, herring, mainly, found, in, the, north, pacific, subspecific, divisions, have, been, suggested, for, both, the, atlantic, and, pacific, herrings, but, their, biological, basis, remains, unclear, in, addition, a, number, of, related, species, all, in, the, clupeidae, are, commonly, referred, to, as, herrings, the, table, immediately, below, includes, those, members, of, the, family, clupeidae, referred, to, by, fishbase, as, herrings, which, have, been, assessed, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, also, a, number, of, other, species, are, called, herrings, which, may, be, related, to, clupeids, or, just, share, some, characteristics, of, herrings, such, as, the, lake, herring, which, is, a, salmonid, just, which, of, these, species, are, called, herrings, can, vary, with, locality, so, what, might, be, called, a, herring, in, one, locality, might, be, called, something, else, in, another, locality, some, examples, the, species, of, clupea, belong, to, the, larger, family, clupeidae, herrings, shads, sardines, menhadens, which, comprises, some, 200, species, that, share, similar, features, these, silvery, coloured, fish, have, a, single, dorsal, fin, which, is, soft, without, spines, they, have, no, lateral, line, and, have, a, protruding, lower, jaw, their, size, varies, between, subspecies, the, baltic, herring, clupea, harengus, membras, is, small, 14, to, 18, cm, about, 5, 5, to, 7, inches, the, proper, atlantic, herring, clupea, harengus, harengus, can, grow, to, about, 46, cm, 18, in, and, weigh, up, 700, g, 1, 5, lb, and, pacific, herring, grow, to, about, 38, cm, 15, in, at, least, one, stock, of, atlantic, herring, spawns, in, every, month, of, the, year, each, spawns, at, a, different, time, and, place, spring, summer, autumn, and, winter, herrings, greenland, populations, spawn, in, 0, 5, metres, 0, 16, feet, of, water, while, north, sea, bank, herrings, spawn, at, down, to, 200, m, 660, ft, in, autumn, eggs, are, laid, on, the, sea, bed, on, rock, stones, gravel, sand, or, beds, of, algae, females, may, deposit, from, 20, 000, to, 40, 000, eggs, according, to, age, and, size, averaging, about, 30, 000, in, sexually, mature, herring, the, genital, organs, grow, before, spawning, reaching, about, one, fifth, of, its, total, weight, the, eggs, sink, to, the, bottom, where, they, stick, in, layers, or, clumps, to, gravel, seaweed, or, stones, by, means, of, their, mucous, coating, or, to, any, other, objects, on, which, they, chance, to, settle, if, the, egg, layers, are, too, thick, they, suffer, from, oxygen, depletion, and, often, die, entangled, in, a, maze, of, mucus, they, need, substantial, water, microturbulence, generally, provided, by, wave, action, or, coastal, currents, survival, is, highest, in, crevices, and, behind, solid, structures, because, predators, feast, on, openly, exposed, eggs, the, individual, eggs, are, 1, to, 1, 4, mm, 3, 64, to, 1, 16, in, in, diameter, depending, on, the, size, of, the, parent, fish, and, also, on, the, local, race, incubation, time, is, about, 40, days, at, 3, c, 37, f, 15, days, at, 7, c, 45, f, or, 11, days, at, 10, c, 50, f, eggs, die, at, temperatures, above, 19, c, 66, f, the, larvae, are, 5, to, 6, mm, 3, 16, to, 1, 4, in, long, at, hatching, with, a, small, yolk, sac, that, is, absorbed, by, the, time, the, larvae, reach, 10, mm, 13, 32, in, only, the, eyes, are, well, pigmented, the, rest, of, the, body, is, nearly, transparent, virtually, invisible, under, water, and, in, natural, lighting, conditions, the, dorsal, fin, forms, at, 15, to, 17, mm, 19, 32, to, 21, 32, in, the, anal, fin, at, about, 30, mm, 1, 3, 16, in, the, ventral, fins, are, visible, and, the, tail, becomes, well, forked, at, 30, to, 35, mm, 1, 3, 8, in, at, about, 40, mm, 1, 9, 16, in, the, larva, begins, to, look, like, a, herring, herring, larvae, are, very, slender, and, can, easily, be, distinguished, from, all, other, young, fish, of, their, range, by, the, location, of, the, vent, which, lies, close, to, the, base, of, the, tail, however, distinguishing, clupeoids, one, from, another, in, their, early, stages, requires, critical, examination, especially, telling, herring, from, sprats, at, one, year, they, are, about, 10, cm, 4, in, long, and, they, first, spawn, at, three, years, herrings, consume, copepods, arrow, worms, pelagic, amphipods, mysids, and, krill, in, the, pelagic, zone, conversely, they, are, a, central, prey, item, or, forage, fish, for, higher, trophic, levels, the, reasons, for, this, success, are, still, enigmatic, one, speculation, attributes, their, dominance, to, the, huge, extremely, fast, cruising, schools, they, inhabit, herring, feed, on, phytoplankton, and, as, they, mature, they, start, to, consume, larger, organisms, they, also, feed, on, zooplankton, tiny, animals, found, in, oceanic, surface, waters, and, small, fish, and, fish, larvae, copepods, and, other, tiny, crustaceans, are, the, most, common, zooplankton, eaten, by, herring, during, daylight, herring, stay, in, the, safety, of, deep, water, feeding, at, the, surface, only, at, night, when, the, chance, of, being, seen, by, predators, is, less, they, swim, along, with, their, mouths, open, filtering, the, plankton, from, the, water, as, it, passes, through, their, gills, young, herring, mostly, hunt, copepods, individually, by, means, of, particulate, feeding, or, raptorial, feeding, a, feeding, method, also, used, by, adult, herring, on, larger, prey, items, like, krill, if, prey, concentrations, reach, very, high, levels, as, in, microlayers, at, fronts, or, directly, below, the, surface, herring, become, filter, feeders, driving, several, meters, forward, with, wide, open, mouth, and, far, expanded, opercula, then, closing, and, cleaning, the, gill, rakers, for, a, few, milliseconds, copepods, the, primary, zooplankton, are, a, major, item, on, the, forage, fish, menu, copepods, are, typically, 1, 2, mm, 1, 32, 3, 32, in, long, with, a, teardrop, shaped, body, some, scientists, say, they, form, the, largest, animal, biomass, on, the, planet, copepods, are, very, alert, and, evasive, they, have, large, antennae, see, photo, below, left, when, they, spread, their, antennae, they, can, sense, the, pressure, wave, from, an, approaching, fish, and, jump, with, great, speed, over, a, few, centimetres, if, copepod, concentrations, reach, high, levels, schooling, herrings, adopt, a, method, called, ram, feeding, in, the, photo, below, herring, ram, feed, on, a, school, of, copepods, they, swim, with, their, mouths, wide, open, and, their, operculae, fully, expanded, the, fish, swim, in, a, grid, where, the, distance, between, them, is, the, same, as, the, jump, length, of, their, prey, as, indicated, in, the, animation, above, right, in, the, animation, juvenile, herring, hunt, the, copepods, in, this, synchronised, way, the, copepods, sense, with, their, antennae, the, pressure, wave, of, an, approaching, herring, and, react, with, a, fast, escape, jump, the, length, of, the, jump, is, fairly, constant, the, fish, align, themselves, in, a, grid, with, this, characteristic, jump, length, a, copepod, can, dart, about, 80, times, before, it, tires, after, a, jump, it, takes, it, 60, milliseconds, to, spread, its, antennae, again, and, this, time, delay, becomes, its, undoing, as, the, almost, endless, stream, of, herring, allows, a, herring, to, eventually, snap, up, the, copepod, a, single, juvenile, herring, could, never, catch, a, large, copepod, other, pelagic, prey, eaten, by, herring, includes, fish, eggs, larval, snails, diatoms, by, herring, larvae, below, 20, mm, 13, 16, in, tintinnids, by, larvae, below, 45, mm, 1, 3, 4, in, molluscan, larvae, menhaden, larvae, krill, mysids, smaller, fishes, pteropods, annelids, calanus, spp, centropagidae, and, meganyctiphanes, norvegica, herrings, along, with, atlantic, cod, and, sprat, are, the, most, important, commercial, species, to, humans, in, the, baltic, sea, the, analysis, of, the, stomach, contents, of, these, fish, indicate, atlantic, cod, is, the, top, predator, preying, on, the, herring, and, sprat, sprat, are, competitive, with, herring, for, the, same, food, resources, this, is, evident, in, the, two, species, vertical, migration, in, the, baltic, sea, where, they, compete, for, the, limited, zooplankton, available, and, necessary, for, their, survival, sprat, are, highly, selective, in, their, diet, and, eat, only, zooplankton, while, herring, are, more, eclectic, adjusting, their, diet, as, they, grow, in, size, in, the, baltic, copepods, of, the, genus, acartia, can, be, present, in, large, numbers, however, they, are, small, in, size, with, a, high, escape, response, so, herring, and, sprat, avoid, trying, to, catch, them, these, copepods, also, tend, to, dwell, more, in, surface, waters, whereas, herring, and, sprat, especially, during, the, day, tend, to, dwell, in, deeper, waters, predators, of, herring, include, seabirds, marine, mammals, such, as, dolphins, porpoises, whales, seals, and, sea, lions, predatory, fish, such, as, sharks, billfish, tuna, salmon, striped, bass, cod, and, halibut, fishermen, also, catch, and, eat, herring, the, predators, often, cooperate, in, groups, using, different, techniques, to, panic, or, herd, a, school, of, herring, into, a, tight, bait, ball, different, predatory, species, then, use, different, techniques, to, pick, the, fish, off, in, the, bait, ball, the, sailfish, raises, its, sail, to, make, it, appear, much, larger, swordfish, charge, at, high, speed, through, the, bait, balls, slashing, with, their, swords, to, kill, or, stun, prey, they, then, turn, and, return, to, consume, their, catch, thresher, sharks, use, their, long, tails, to, stun, the, shoaling, fish, these, sharks, compact, their, prey, school, by, swimming, around, them, and, splashing, the, water, with, their, tails, often, in, pairs, or, small, groups, they, then, strike, them, sharply, with, the, upper, lobe, of, their, tails, to, stun, them, spinner, sharks, charge, vertically, through, the, school, spinning, on, their, axes, with, their, mouths, open, and, snapping, all, around, the, sharks, momentum, at, the, end, of, these, spiraling, runs, often, carries, them, into, the, air, some, whales, lunge, feed, on, bait, balls, lunge, feeding, is, an, extreme, feeding, method, where, the, whale, accelerates, from, below, the, bait, ball, to, a, high, velocity, and, then, opens, its, mouth, to, a, large, gape, angle, this, generates, the, water, pressure, required, to, expand, its, mouth, and, engulf, and, filter, a, huge, amount, of, water, and, fish, lunge, feeding, by, rorquals, a, family, of, huge, baleen, whales, that, includes, the, blue, whale, is, said, to, be, the, largest, biomechanical, event, on, earth, adult, herring, are, harvested, for, their, flesh, and, eggs, and, they, are, often, used, as, baitfish, the, trade, in, herring, is, an, important, sector, of, many, economies, around, the, world, in, europe, the, fish, has, been, called, the, silver, of, the, sea, and, its, trade, has, been, so, significant, to, many, countries, that, it, has, been, regarded, as, the, most, commercially, important, fishery, in, history, herring, has, been, a, staple, food, source, since, at, least, 3000, bc, the, fish, is, served, numerous, ways, and, many, regional, recipes, are, used, eaten, raw, fermented, pickled, or, cured, by, other, techniques, such, as, being, smoked, as, kippers, herring, are, very, high, in, the, long, chain, omega, 3, fatty, acids, epa, and, dha, they, are, a, source, of, vitamin, d, water, pollution, influences, the, amount, of, herring, that, may, be, safely, consumed, for, example, large, baltic, herring, slightly, exceeds, recommended, limits, with, respect, to, pcb, and, dioxin, although, some, sources, point, out, that, the, cancer, reducing, effect, of, omega, 3, fatty, acids, is, statistically, stronger, than, the, carcinogenic, effect, of, pcbs, and, dioxins, the, contaminant, levels, depend, on, the, age, of, the, fish, which, can, be, inferred, from, their, size, baltic, herrings, larger, than, 17, cm, 6, 7, in, may, be, eaten, twice, a, month, while, herrings, smaller, than, 17, cm, can, be, eaten, freely, mercury, in, fish, also, influences, the, amount, of, fish, that, women, who, are, pregnant, or, planning, to, be, pregnant, within, the, next, one, or, two, years, may, safely, eat, the, herring, has, played, a, highly, significant, role, in, history, both, socially, and, economically, during, the, middle, ages, herring, prompted, the, founding, of, great, yarmouth, and, copenhagen, and, played, a, critical, role, in, the, medieval, development, of, amsterdam, in, 1274, while, on, his, deathbed, at, the, monastery, of, fossanova, south, of, rome, italy, when, encouraged, to, eat, something, to, regain, his, strength, thomas, aquinas, asked, for, fresh, herring
