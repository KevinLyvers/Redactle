superficially, resembles, its, namesake, the, lichen, usnea, it, is, neither, a, lichen, nor, a, moss, instead, being, a, member, of, the, bromeliad, family, and, it, is, not, native, to, spain, spanish, moss, consists, of, one, or, more, slender, stems, bearing, alternate, thin, curved, or, curly, and, heavily, scaled, leaves, 2, 6, cm, 0, 8, 2, 4, inches, long, and, 1, mm, 0, 04, inches, broad, that, grow, vegetatively, in, a, chain, like, fashion, pendant, forming, hanging, structures, of, up, to, 6, m, 20, feet, the, plant, has, no, roots, its, flowers, are, yellow, green, and, small, with, spreading, petals, the, scape, is, partly, hidden, within, the, leaf, sheath, spanish, moss, propagates, both, by, seed, and, vegetatively, by, fragments, that, are, carried, on, the, wind, and, stick, to, tree, limbs, or, that, are, carried, to, other, locations, by, birds, as, nesting, material, spanish, moss, is, in, the, family, bromeliaceae, the, bromeliads, formerly, it, was, placed, in, the, genera, anoplophytum, caraguata, and, renealmia, the, specific, name, of, the, plant, usneoides, means, resembling, usnea, a, lichen, spanish, moss, primary, range, is, in, the, southeastern, united, states, including, puerto, rico, and, the, u, s, virgin, islands, to, argentina, where, the, climate, is, warm, enough, and, a, relatively, high, average, humidity, occurs, in, north, america, it, occurs, in, a, broad, band, following, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, the, southern, atlantic, coast, the, northern, limit, of, its, natural, range, is, northampton, county, virginia, with, colonial, era, reports, of, it, in, southern, maryland, where, no, populations, are, now, known, to, exist, it, has, been, introduced, to, locations, around, the, world, with, similar, conditions, including, hawaii, where, it, first, established, itself, in, the, nineteenth, century, spanish, moss, is, not, parasitic, it, is, an, epiphyte, that, absorbs, nutrients, and, water, through, its, own, leaves, from, the, air, and, rain, falling, upon, it, while, its, presence, rarely, kills, the, trees, on, which, it, grows, it, occasionally, becomes, so, thick, that, by, shading, the, leaves, of, the, tree, it, slows, the, growth, rate, of, the, tree, it, can, use, the, water, conserving, strategy, of, crassulacean, acid, metabolism, for, photosynthesis, in, the, southern, u, s, the, plant, seems, to, show, preferences, for, southern, live, oak, quercus, virginiana, and, bald, cypress, taxodium, distichum, because, of, their, high, rates, of, foliar, mineral, leaching, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and, phosphorus, that, provides, an, abundant, supply, of, nutrients, to, the, epiphytic, plant, it, can, also, colonize, other, tree, species, such, as, sweetgum, liquidambar, styraciflua, crepe, myrtles, lagerstroemia, spp, other, oaks, and, even, pines, it, also, grows, more, uncommonly, on, artificial, structures, such, as, fencing, and, telephone, lines, spanish, moss, shelters, a, number, of, creatures, including, rat, snakes, and, three, species, of, bats, one, species, of, jumping, spider, pelegrina, tillandsiae, has, been, found, only, on, spanish, moss, although, widely, presumed, to, infest, spanish, moss, in, one, study, of, the, ecology, of, the, plant, chiggers, were, not, present, among, thousands, of, other, arthropods, identified, on, the, plant, spanish, moss, is, sensitive, to, airborne, contaminants, it, does, not, grow, in, areas, where, smoke, is, common, such, as, near, chimneys, it, has, receded, from, urban, areas, due, to, increasing, air, pollution, spanish, moss, is, often, associated, with, southern, gothic, imagery, and, deep, south, culture, due, to, its, propensity, for, growing, in, subtropical, humid, southern, locales, such, as, alabama, southern, arkansas, florida, georgia, louisiana, mississippi, north, carolina, south, carolina, east, and, south, texas, and, extreme, southern, virginia, one, anecdote, about, the, origin, of, spanish, moss, is, called, the, meanest, man, who, ever, lived, in, which, the, man, s, white, hair, grew, very, long, and, got, caught, on, trees, spanish, moss, was, introduced, to, hawaii, in, the, nineteenth, century, it, became, a, popular, ornamental, and, lei, plant, in, hawaii, it, was, named, umi, umi, o, dole, after, the, beard, of, sanford, b, dole, the, first, president, of, the, provisional, government, of, hawaii, it, is, also, known, as, hinahina, silvery, borrowing, the, name, of, the, native, heliotrope, used, in, lei, until, shoreline, development, made, access, difficult, it, has, become, a, substitute, for, the, native, hinahina, in, lei, used, for, pageantry, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, plant, was, heavily, marketed, as, pele, s, hair, lauoho, o, pele, which, actually, refers, to, a, type, of, filamentous, volcanic, glass, spanish, moss, has, been, used, for, various, purposes, including, building, insulation, mulch, packing, material, mattress, stuffing, and, fiber, in, the, early, 1900s, it, was, used, commercially, in, the, padding, of, car, seats, more, than, 10, 000, tons, of, processed, spanish, moss, was, produced, in, 1939, today, it, is, collected, in, smaller, quantities, for, use, in, arts, and, crafts, as, bedding, for, flower, gardens, and, as, an, ingredient, in, bousillage, a, traditional, wall, covering, material, in, some, parts, of, latin, america, and, louisiana, it, is, used, in, nativity, scenes, in, the, desert, regions, of, southwestern, united, states, dried, spanish, moss, is, sometimes, used, in, the, manufacture, of, evaporative, coolers, colloquially, known, as, swamp, coolers, and, in, some, areas, as, desert, coolers, which, are, used, to, cool, homes, and, offices, much, less, expensively, than, air, conditioners, the, cooling, technology, uses, a, pump, that, squirts, water, onto, a, pad, made, of, spanish, moss, plants, a, fan, then, pulls, air, through, the, pad, and, into, the, building, evaporation, of, the, water, on, the, pads, serves, to, reduce, air, temperature, cooling, the, building
