lymphoma, is, a, group, of, blood, and, lymph, tumors, that, develop, from, lymphocytes, a, type, of, white, blood, cell, the, name, typically, refers, to, just, the, cancerous, versions, rather, than, all, such, tumours, signs, and, symptoms, may, include, enlarged, lymph, nodes, fever, drenching, sweats, unintended, weight, loss, itching, and, constantly, feeling, tired, the, enlarged, lymph, nodes, are, usually, painless, the, sweats, are, most, common, at, night, many, subtypes, of, lymphomas, are, known, the, two, main, categories, of, lymphomas, are, the, non, hodgkin, lymphoma, nhl, 90, of, cases, and, hodgkin, lymphoma, hl, 10, lymphomas, leukemias, and, myelomas, are, a, part, of, the, broader, group, of, tumors, of, the, hematopoietic, and, lymphoid, tissues, risk, factors, for, hodgkin, lymphoma, include, infection, with, epstein, barr, virus, and, a, history, of, the, disease, in, the, family, risk, factors, for, common, types, of, non, hodgkin, lymphomas, include, autoimmune, diseases, hiv, aids, infection, with, human, t, lymphotropic, virus, immunosuppressant, medications, and, some, pesticides, eating, large, amounts, of, red, meat, and, tobacco, smoking, may, also, increase, the, risk, diagnosis, if, enlarged, lymph, nodes, are, present, is, usually, by, lymph, node, biopsy, blood, urine, and, bone, marrow, testing, may, also, be, useful, in, the, diagnosis, medical, imaging, may, then, be, done, to, determine, if, and, where, the, cancer, has, spread, lymphoma, most, often, spreads, to, the, lungs, liver, and, brain, treatment, may, involve, one, or, more, of, the, following, chemotherapy, radiation, therapy, proton, therapy, targeted, therapy, and, surgery, in, some, non, hodgkin, lymphomas, an, increased, amount, of, protein, produced, by, the, lymphoma, cells, causes, the, blood, to, become, so, thick, that, plasmapheresis, is, performed, to, remove, the, protein, watchful, waiting, may, be, appropriate, for, certain, types, the, outcome, depends, on, the, subtype, with, some, being, curable, and, treatment, prolonging, survival, in, most, the, five, year, survival, rate, in, the, united, states, for, all, hodgkin, lymphoma, subtypes, is, 85, while, that, for, non, hodgkin, lymphomas, is, 69, worldwide, lymphomas, developed, in, 566, 000, people, in, 2012, and, caused, 305, 000, deaths, they, make, up, 3, 4, of, all, cancers, making, them, as, a, group, the, seventh, most, common, form, in, children, they, are, the, third, most, common, cancer, they, occur, more, often, in, the, developed, world, than, the, developing, world, lymphoma, may, present, with, certain, nonspecific, symptoms, if, the, symptoms, are, persistent, an, evaluation, to, determine, their, cause, including, possible, lymphoma, should, be, undertaken, lymphoma, is, definitively, diagnosed, by, a, lymph, node, biopsy, meaning, a, partial, or, total, excision, of, a, lymph, node, examined, under, the, microscope, this, examination, reveals, histopathological, features, that, may, indicate, lymphoma, after, lymphoma, is, diagnosed, a, variety, of, tests, may, be, carried, out, to, look, for, specific, features, characteristic, of, different, types, of, lymphoma, these, include, according, to, the, world, health, organization, who, lymphoma, classification, should, reflect, in, which, lymphocyte, population, the, neoplasm, arises, thus, neoplasms, that, arise, from, precursor, lymphoid, cells, are, distinguished, from, those, that, arise, from, mature, lymphoid, cells, most, mature, lymphoid, neoplasms, comprise, the, non, hodgkin, lymphomas, historically, mature, histiocytic, and, dendritic, cell, hdc, neoplasms, have, been, considered, mature, lymphoid, neoplasms, since, these, often, involve, lymphoid, tissue, lymphoma, can, also, spread, to, the, central, nervous, system, often, around, the, brain, in, the, meninges, known, as, lymphomatous, meningitis, lm, hodgkin, lymphoma, accounts, for, about, 15, of, lymphomas, it, differs, from, other, forms, of, lymphomas, in, its, prognosis, and, several, pathological, characteristics, a, division, into, hodgkin, and, non, hodgkin, lymphomas, is, used, in, several, of, the, older, classification, systems, a, hodgkin, lymphoma, is, marked, by, the, presence, of, a, type, of, cell, called, the, reed, sternberg, cell, non, hodgkin, lymphomas, which, are, defined, as, being, all, lymphomas, except, hodgkin, lymphoma, are, more, common, than, hodgkin, lymphoma, a, wide, variety, of, lymphomas, are, in, this, class, and, the, causes, the, types, of, cells, involved, and, the, prognoses, vary, by, type, the, number, of, cases, per, year, of, non, hodgkin, lymphoma, increases, with, age, it, is, further, divided, into, several, subtypes, epstein, barr, virus, associated, lymphoproliferative, diseases, are, a, group, of, benign, premalignant, and, malignant, diseases, of, lymphoid, cells, i, e, b, cells, t, cells, nk, cells, and, histiocytic, dendritic, cells, in, which, one, or, more, of, these, cell, types, is, infected, with, the, epstein, barr, virus, ebv, the, virus, may, be, responsible, for, the, development, and, or, progression, of, these, diseases, in, addition, to, ebv, positive, hodgkin, lymphomas, the, world, health, organization, 2016, includes, the, following, lymphomas, when, associated, with, ebv, infection, in, this, group, of, diseases, burkitt, lymphoma, large, b, cell, lymphoma, not, otherwise, specified, diffuse, large, b, cell, lymphoma, associated, with, chronic, inflammation, fibrin, associated, diffuse, large, b, cell, lymphoma, primary, effusion, lymphoma, plasmablastic, lymphoma, extranodal, nk, t, cell, lymphoma, nasal, type, peripheral, t, cell, lymphoma, not, otherwise, specified, angioimmunoblastic, t, cell, lymphoma, follicular, t, cell, lymphoma, and, systemic, t, cell, lymphoma, of, childhood, the, who, classification, published, in, 2001, and, updated, in, 2008, 2017, and, 2022, is, based, upon, the, foundations, laid, within, the, revised, european, american, lymphoma, classification, real, this, system, groups, lymphomas, by, cell, type, i, e, the, normal, cell, type, that, most, resembles, the, tumor, and, defining, phenotypic, molecular, or, cytogenetic, characteristics, the, five, groups, are, shown, in, the, table, hodgkin, lymphoma, is, considered, separately, within, the, who, and, preceding, classifications, although, it, is, recognized, as, being, a, tumor, albeit, markedly, abnormal, of, lymphocytes, of, mature, b, cell, lineage, of, the, many, forms, of, lymphoma, some, are, categorized, as, indolent, e, g, small, lymphocytic, lymphoma, compatible, with, a, long, life, even, without, treatment, whereas, other, forms, are, aggressive, e, g, burkitt, s, lymphoma, causing, rapid, deterioration, and, death, however, most, of, the, aggressive, lymphomas, respond, well, to, treatment, and, are, curable, the, prognosis, therefore, depends, on, the, correct, diagnosis, and, classification, of, the, disease, which, is, established, after, examination, of, a, biopsy, by, a, pathologist, usually, a, hematopathologist, several, previous, classifications, have, been, used, including, rappaport, 1956, lennert, kiel, 1974, bnli, working, formulation, 1982, and, real, 1994, the, working, formulation, of, 1982, was, a, classification, of, non, hodgkin, lymphoma, it, excluded, the, hodgkin, lymphomas, and, divided, the, remaining, lymphomas, into, four, grades, low, intermediate, high, and, miscellaneous, related, to, prognosis, with, some, further, subdivisions, based, on, the, size, and, shape, of, affected, cells, this, purely, histological, classification, included, no, information, about, cell, surface, markers, or, genetics, and, made, no, distinction, between, t, cell, lymphomas, and, b, cell, lymphomas, it, was, widely, accepted, at, the, time, of, its, publication, but, by, 2004, was, obsolete, in, 1994, the, revised, european, american, lymphoma, real, classification, applied, immunophenotypic, and, genetic, features, in, identifying, distinct, clinicopathologic, entities, among, all, the, lymphomas, except, hodgkin, lymphoma, for, coding, purposes, the, icd, o, codes, 9590, 9999, and, icd, 10, codes, c81, c96, are, available, after, a, diagnosis, and, before, treatment, cancer, is, staged, this, refers, to, determining, if, the, cancer, has, spread, and, if, so, whether, locally, or, to, distant, sites, staging, is, reported, as, a, grade, between, i, confined, and, iv, spread, the, stage, of, a, lymphoma, helps, predict, a, patient, s, prognosis, and, is, used, to, help, select, the, appropriate, therapy, the, ann, arbor, staging, system, is, routinely, used, for, staging, of, both, hl, and, nhl, in, this, staging, system, stage, i, represents, localized, disease, contained, within, a, lymph, node, group, ii, represents, the, presence, of, lymphoma, in, two, or, more, lymph, nodes, groups, iii, represents, spread, of, the, lymphoma, to, lymph, nodes, groups, on, both, sides, of, the, diaphragm, and, iv, indicates, spread, to, tissue, outside, the, lymphatic, system, different, suffixes, imply, the, involvement, of, different, organs, for, example, s, for, the, spleen, and, h, for, the, liver, extra, lymphatic, involvement, is, expressed, with, the, letter, e, in, addition, the, presence, of, b, symptoms, one, or, more, of, the, following, unintentional, loss, of, 10, body, weight, in, the, last, 6, months, night, sweats, or, persistent, fever, of, 38, c, or, more, or, their, absence, is, expressed, with, b, or, a, respectively, ct, scan, or, pet, scan, imaging, modalities, are, used, to, stage, cancer, pet, scanning, is, advised, for, fluorodeoxyglucose, avid, lymphomas, such, as, hodgkin, lymphoma, as, a, staging, tool, that, can, even, replace, bone, marrow, biopsy, for, other, lymphomas, ct, scanning, is, recommended, for, staging, age, and, poor, performance, status, are, other, established, poor, prognostic, factors, this, means, that, people, who, are, elderly, or, too, sick, to, take, care, of, themselves, are, more, likely, to, be, killed, by, lymphoma, than, others, certain, lymphomas, extranodal, nk, t, cell, lymphoma, nasal, type, and, type, ii, enteropathy, associated, t, cell, lymphoma, can, be, mimicked, by, two, benign, diseases, that, involve, the, excessive, proliferation, of, nonmalignant, nk, cells, in, the, gi, tract, natural, killer, cell, enteropathy, a, disease, wherein, nk, cell, infiltrative, lesions, occur, in, the, intestine, colon, stomach, or, esophagus, and, lymphomatoid, gastropathy, a, disease, wherein, these, cells, infiltrative, lesions, are, limited, to, the, stomach, these, diseases, do, not, progress, to, cancer, may, regress, spontaneously, and, do, not, respond, to, and, do, not, require, chemotherapy, or, other, lymphoma, treatments, prognoses, and, treatments, are, different, for, hl, and, between, all, the, different, forms, of, nhl, and, also, depend, on, the, grade, of, tumour, referring, to, how, quickly, a, cancer, replicates, paradoxically, high, grade, lymphomas, are, more, readily, treated, and, have, better, prognoses, burkitt, lymphoma, for, example, is, a, high, grade, tumour, known, to, double, within, days, and, is, highly, responsive, to, treatment, many, low, grade, lymphomas, remain, indolent, growing, slowly, or, not, at, all, for, many, years, sometimes, for, the, rest, of, the, person, s, life, with, an, indolent, lymphoma, such, as, follicular, lymphoma, watchful, waiting, is, often, the, initial, course, of, action, because, monitoring, is, less, risky, and, less, harmful, than, early, treatment, if, a, low, grade, lymphoma, becomes, symptomatic, radiotherapy, or, chemotherapy, are, the, treatments, of, choice, although, these, treatments, do, not, permanently, cure, the, lymphoma, they, can, alleviate, the, symptoms, particularly, painful, lymphadenopathy, people, with, these, types, of, lymphoma, can, live, near, normal, lifespans, even, though, the, disease, is, technically, incurable, some, centers, advocate, the, use, of, single, agent, rituximab, in, the, treatment, of, follicular, lymphoma, rather, than, the, wait, and, watch, approach, watchful, waiting, is, not, a, desirable, strategy, for, everyone, as, it, leads, to, significant, distress, and, anxiety, in, some, people, it, has, been, called, watch, and, worry, treatment, of, some, other, more, aggressive, forms, of, lymphoma, can, result, in, a, cure, in, the, majority, of, cases, but, the, prognosis, for, people, with, a, poor, response, to, therapy, is, worse, treatment, for, these, types, of, lymphoma, typically, consists, of, aggressive, chemotherapy, including, the, chop, or, r, chop, regimen, a, number, of, people, are, cured, with, first, line, chemotherapy, most, relapses, occur, within, the, first, two, years, and, the, relapse, risk, drops, significantly, thereafter, for, people, who, relapse, high, dose, chemotherapy, followed, by, autologous, stem, cell, transplantation, is, a, proven, approach, the, treatment, of, side, effects, is, also, important, as, they, can, occur, due, to, the, chemotherapy, or, the, stem, cell, transplantation, it, was, evaluated, whether, mesenchymal, stromal, cells, can, be, used, for, the, treatment, and, prophylaxis, of, graft, versus, host, diseases, the, evidence, is, very, uncertain, about, the, therapeutic, effect, of, mesenchymal, stromal, cells, to, treat, graft, versus, host, diseases, on, the, all, cause, mortality, and, complete, disappear, of, chronic, acute, graft, versus, host, diseases, mesenchymal, stromal, cells, may, result, in, little, to, no, difference, in, the, all, cause, mortality, relapse, of, malignant, disease, and, incidence, of, acute, and, chronic, graft, versus, host, diseases, if, they, are, used, for, prophylactic, reason, moreover, it, was, seen, that, platelet, transfusions, for, people, undergoing, a, chemotherapy, or, a, stem, cell, transplantation, for, the, prevention, of, bleeding, events, had, different, effects, on, the, number, of, participants, with, a, bleeding, event, the, number, of, days, on, which, a, bleeding, occurred, the, mortality, secondary, to, bleeding, and, the, number, of, platelet, transfusions, depending, on, the, way, they, were, used, therapeutic, depending, on, a, threshold, different, dose, schedules, or, prophylactic, four, chimeric, antigen, receptor, t, cell, therapies, are, fda, approved, for, non, hodgkin, lymphoma, including, lisocabtagene, maraleucel, for, relapsed, or, refractory, large, b, cell, lymphoma, with, two, failed, systemic, treatments, axicabtagene, ciloleucel, tisagenlecleucel, for, large, b, cell, lymphoma, and, brexucabtagene, autoleucel, for, mantle, cell, lymphoma, these, therapies, come, with, certification, and, other, restrictions, hodgkin, lymphoma, typically, is, treated, with, radiotherapy, alone, as, long, as, it, is, localized, advanced, hodgkin, disease, requires, systemic, chemotherapy, sometimes, combined, with, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, used, includes, the, abvd, regimen, which, is, commonly, used, in, the, united, states, other, regimens, used, in, the, management, of, hodgkin, lymphoma, include, beacopp, and, stanford, v, considerable, controversy, exists, regarding, the, use, of, abvd, or, beacopp, briefly, both, regimens, are, effective, but, beacopp, is, associated, with, more, toxicity, encouragingly, a, significant, number, of, people, who, relapse, after, abvd, can, still, be, salvaged, by, stem, cell, transplant, scientists, evaluated, whether, positron, emission, tomography, scans, between, the, chemotherapy, cycles, can, be, used, to, make, assumptions, about, the, survival, the, evidence, is, very, uncertain, about, the, effect, of, negative, good, prognosis, or, positive, bad, prognosis, interim, pet, scan, results, on, the, progression, free, survival, negative, interim, pet, scan, results, may, result, in, an, increase, in, progression, free, survival, compared, if, the, adjusted, result, was, measured, negative, interim, pet, scan, results, probably, result, in, a, large, increase, in, the, overall, survival, compared, to, those, with, a, positive, interim, pet, scan, result, current, research, evaluated, whether, nivolumab, can, be, used, for, the, treatment, of, a, hodgkin, s, lymphoma, the, evidence, is, very, uncertain, about, the, effect, of, nivolumab, for, patients, with, a, hodgkin, s, lymphoma, on, the, overall, survival, the, quality, of, life, the, survival, without, a, progression, the, response, rate, complete, disappear, and, grade, 3, or, 4, serious, adverse, events, palliative, care, a, specialized, medical, care, focused, on, the, symptoms, pain, and, stress, of, a, serious, illness, is, recommended, by, multiple, national, cancer, treatment, guidelines, as, an, accompaniment, to, curative, treatments, for, people, with, lymphoma, it, is, used, to, address, both, the, direct, symptoms, of, lymphoma, and, many, unwanted, side, effects, that, arise, from, treatments, palliative, care, can, be, especially, helpful, for, children, who, develop, lymphoma, helping, both, children, and, their, families, deal, with, the, physical, and, emotional, symptoms, of, the, disease, for, these, reasons, palliative, care, is, especially, important, for, people, requiring, bone, marrow, transplants, adding, physical, exercises, to, the, standard, treatment, for, adult, patients, with, haematological, malignancies, like, lymphomas, may, result, in, little, to, no, difference, in, the, mortality, the, quality, of, life, and, the, physical, functioning, these, exercises, may, result, in, a, slight, reduction, in, depression, furthermore, aerobic, physical, exercises, probably, reduce, fatigue, the, evidence, is, very, uncertain, about, the, effect, on, anxiety, and, serious, adverse, events, lymphoma, is, the, most, common, form, of, hematological, malignancy, or, blood, cancer, in, the, developed, world, taken, together, lymphomas, represent, 5, 3, of, all, cancers, excluding, simple, basal, cell, and, squamous, cell, skin, cancers, in, the, united, states, and, 55, 6, of, all, blood, cancers, according, to, the, u, s, national, institutes, of, health, lymphomas, account, for, about, 5, and, hodgkin, lymphoma, in, particular, accounts, for, less, than, 1, of, all, cases, of, cancer, in, the, united, states, because, the, whole, lymphatic, system, is, part, of, the, body, s, immune, system, people, with, a, weakened, immune, system, such, as, from, hiv, infection, or, from, certain, drugs, or, medication, also, have, a, higher, number, of, cases, of, lymphoma, thomas, hodgkin, published, the, first, description, of, lymphoma, in, 1832, specifically, of, the, form, named, after, him, since, then, many, other, forms, of, lymphoma, have, been, described, the, term, lymphoma, is, from, latin, lympha, water, and, from, greek, oma, morbid, growth, tumor, the, two, types, of, lymphoma, research, are, clinical, or, translational, research, and, basic, research, clinical, translational, research, focuses, on, studying, the, disease, in, a, defined, and, generally, immediately, applicable, way, such, as, testing, a, new, drug, in, people, studies, may, focus, on, effective, means, of, treatment, better, ways, of, treating, the, disease, improving, the, quality, of, life, for, people, or, appropriate, care, in, remission, or, after, cures, hundreds, of, clinical, trials, are, being, planned, or, conducted, at, any, given, time, basic, science, research, studies, the, disease, process, at, a, distance, such, as, seeing, whether, a, suspected, carcinogen, can, cause, healthy, cells, to, turn, into, lymphoma, cells, in, the, laboratory, or, how, the, dna, changes, inside, lymphoma, cells, as, the, disease, progresses, the, results, from, basic, research, studies, are, generally, less, immediately, useful, to, people, with, the, disease, but, can, improve, scientists, understanding, of, lymphoma, and, form, the, foundation, for, future, more, effective, treatments
