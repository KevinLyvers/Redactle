suborder, ensifera, suborder, caelifera, orthoptera, from, ancient, greek, orth, s, straight, and, pter, wings, is, an, order, of, insects, that, comprises, the, grasshoppers, locusts, and, crickets, including, closely, related, insects, such, as, the, bush, crickets, or, katydids, and, w, t, the, order, is, subdivided, into, two, suborders, caelifera, grasshoppers, locusts, and, close, relatives, and, ensifera, crickets, and, close, relatives, more, than, 20, 000, species, are, distributed, worldwide, the, insects, in, the, order, have, incomplete, metamorphosis, and, produce, sound, known, as, a, stridulation, by, rubbing, their, wings, against, each, other, or, their, legs, the, wings, or, legs, containing, rows, of, corrugated, bumps, the, tympanum, or, ear, is, located, in, the, front, tibia, in, crickets, mole, crickets, and, bush, crickets, or, katydids, and, on, the, first, abdominal, segment, in, the, grasshoppers, and, locusts, these, organisms, use, vibrations, to, locate, other, individuals, grasshoppers, and, other, orthopterans, are, able, to, fold, their, wings, i, e, they, are, members, of, neoptera, the, name, is, derived, from, the, greek, orthos, meaning, straight, and, pteron, meaning, wing, orthopterans, have, a, generally, cylindrical, body, with, elongated, hindlegs, and, musculature, adapted, for, jumping, they, have, mandibulate, mouthparts, for, biting, and, chewing, and, large, compound, eyes, and, may, or, may, not, have, ocelli, depending, on, the, species, the, antennae, have, multiple, joints, and, filiform, type, and, are, of, variable, length, the, first, and, third, segments, on, the, thorax, are, larger, while, the, second, segment, is, much, smaller, they, have, two, pairs, of, wings, which, are, held, overlapping, the, abdomen, at, rest, the, forewings, or, tegmina, are, narrower, than, the, hindwings, and, hardened, at, the, base, while, the, hindwings, are, membranous, with, straight, veins, and, numerous, cross, veins, at, rest, the, hindwings, are, held, folded, fan, like, under, the, forewings, the, final, two, to, three, segments, of, the, abdomen, are, reduced, and, have, single, segmented, cerci, orthopterans, have, a, paurometabolous, lifecycle, or, incomplete, metamorphosis, the, use, of, sound, is, generally, crucial, in, courtship, and, most, species, have, distinct, songs, most, grasshoppers, lay, their, eggs, in, the, ground, or, on, vegetation, the, eggs, hatch, and, the, young, nymphs, resemble, adults, but, lack, wings, and, at, this, stage, are, often, called, hoppers, they, may, often, also, have, a, radically, different, coloration, from, the, adults, through, successive, moults, the, nymphs, develop, wings, until, their, final, moult, into, a, mature, adult, with, fully, developed, wings, the, number, of, moults, varies, between, species, growth, is, also, very, variable, and, may, take, a, few, weeks, to, some, months, depending, on, food, availability, and, weather, conditions, this, order, evolved, 300, million, years, ago, with, a, division, into, two, suborders, caelifera, and, ensifera, occurring, 256, million, years, ago, the, orthoptera, are, divided, into, two, suborders, caelifera, and, ensifera, that, have, been, shown, to, be, monophyletic, grylloidea, crickets, rhaphidophoroidea, cave, weta, cave, crickets, tettigoniidea, grigs, weta, katydids, etc, schizodactyloidea, dune, crickets, tridactyloidea, tetrigoidea, eumastacoidea, pneumoroidea, pyrgomorphoidea, acridoidea, etc, taxonomists, classify, members, of, the, caelifera, and, ensifera, into, infraorders, and, superfamilies, as, follows, several, species, of, orthoptera, are, considered, pests, of, crops, and, rangelands, or, seeking, warmth, in, homes, by, humans, the, two, groups, of, orthoptera, that, cause, the, most, damage, are, grasshoppers, and, locusts, locust, are, historically, known, for, wiping, out, fields, of, crops, in, a, day, locust, have, the, ability, to, eat, up, to, their, own, body, weight, in, a, single, day, individuals, gather, in, large, groups, called, swarms, these, swarms, can, range, up, to, 80, million, individuals, that, stretch, 460, square, miles, grasshoppers, can, cause, major, agricultural, damage, but, not, to, the, documented, extent, as, locust, historically, have, these, insects, mainly, feed, on, weeds, and, grasses, however, during, times, of, drought, and, high, population, density, they, will, feed, on, crops, they, are, a, known, pest, in, soybean, fields, and, will, likely, feed, on, these, crops, once, preferred, food, sources, have, become, scarce, most, orthopterans, are, edible, making, up, 13, of, all, insects, including, some, 80, species, of, grasshoppers, being, regularly, consumed, worldwide, in, madagascar, and, oaxaca, grasshoppers, and, locusts, are, usually, collected, early, in, the, morning, when, it, is, cooler, as, the, orthopterans, are, less, mobile, due, to, being, cold, blooded, in, thailand, house, crickets, are, commonly, reared, and, eaten, as, of, 2012, around, 20, 000, cricket, farmers, had, farms, in, 53, of, their, 76, provinces, in, the, second, century, bce, in, ancient, greece, diodorus, siculus, is, known, to, have, called, people, from, ethiopia, acridophagi, meaning, eaters, of, locusts, in, judaism, the, orthoptera, include, the, only, insects, considered, kosher, the, list, of, dietary, laws, in, the, book, of, leviticus, forbids, all, flying, insects, that, walk, but, makes, an, exception, for, certain, locusts, the, torah, states, the, only, kosher, flying, insects, with, four, walking, legs, have, knees, that, extend, above, their, feet, so, that, they, hop, with, new, research, showing, promise, in, locating, alternative, biofuel, sources, in, the, gut, of, insects, grasshoppers, are, one, species, of, interest, the, insect, s, ability, to, break, down, cellulose, and, lignin, without, producing, greenhouse, gases, has, aroused, scientific, interest
