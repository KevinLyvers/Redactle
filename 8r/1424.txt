scarlet, fever, also, known, as, scarlatina, is, an, infectious, disease, caused, by, streptococcus, pyogenes, a, group, a, streptococcus, gas, it, most, commonly, affects, children, between, five, and, 15, years, of, age, the, signs, and, symptoms, include, a, sore, throat, fever, headache, swollen, lymph, nodes, and, a, characteristic, rash, the, face, is, flushed, and, the, rash, is, red, and, blanching, it, typically, feels, like, sandpaper, and, the, tongue, may, be, red, and, bumpy, the, rash, occurs, as, a, result, of, capillary, damage, by, exotoxins, produced, by, s, pyogenes, on, darker, pigmented, skin, the, rash, may, be, hard, to, discern, scarlet, fever, develops, in, a, small, number, of, people, who, have, strep, throat, or, streptococcal, skin, infections, the, bacteria, are, usually, spread, by, people, coughing, or, sneezing, it, can, also, be, spread, when, a, person, touches, an, object, that, has, the, bacteria, on, it, and, then, touches, their, mouth, or, nose, the, diagnosis, is, typically, confirmed, by, culturing, swabs, of, the, throat, there, is, no, vaccine, for, scarlet, fever, prevention, is, by, frequent, handwashing, not, sharing, personal, items, and, staying, away, from, other, people, when, sick, the, disease, is, treatable, with, antibiotics, which, reduce, symptoms, and, spread, and, prevent, most, complications, outcomes, with, scarlet, fever, are, typically, good, if, treated, long, term, complications, as, a, result, of, scarlet, fever, include, kidney, disease, rheumatic, fever, and, arthritis, in, the, early, 20th, century, it, was, a, leading, cause, of, death, in, children, but, even, before, world, war, ii, and, the, introduction, of, antibiotics, its, severity, was, already, declining, perhaps, due, to, better, living, conditions, the, introduction, of, better, control, measures, or, a, decline, in, the, virulence, of, the, bacteria, in, recent, years, there, have, been, signs, of, antibiotic, resistance, there, was, an, outbreak, in, hong, kong, in, 2011, and, in, the, uk, in, 2014, and, occurrence, of, the, disease, rose, by, 68, in, the, uk, between, 2014, and, 2018, research, published, in, october, 2020, showed, that, infection, of, the, bacterium, by, three, viruses, has, led, to, more, virulent, strains, of, the, bacterium, scarlet, fever, typically, presents, with, a, sudden, onset, of, sore, throat, fever, and, malaise, headache, nausea, vomiting, and, abdominal, pain, may, also, be, present, scarlet, fever, usually, follows, from, a, group, a, streptococcal, infection, that, involves, a, strep, throat, such, as, streptococcal, tonsillitis, or, more, usually, streptococcal, pharyngitis, often, these, can, present, together, known, as, pharyngotonsillitis, the, signs, and, symptoms, are, therefore, those, of, a, strep, throat, but, these, are, followed, by, the, inclusion, of, the, characteristic, widespread, rash, the, rash, usually, appears, one, to, two, days, later, but, may, appear, before, or, up, to, seven, days, following, feeling, ill, it, generally, hurts, to, swallow, however, not, all, cases, present, with, a, fever, the, degree, of, tiredness, may, vary, the, sore, throat, and, tongue, changes, might, be, slight, or, absent, and, the, rash, can, be, patchy, rather, than, diffuse, in, some, cough, hoarseness, runny, nose, diarrhea, and, conjunctivitis, are, typically, absent, in, scarlet, fever, such, symptoms, indicate, what, is, more, likely, a, viral, infection, strep, throat, is, usually, associated, with, fatigue, and, a, fever, of, over, 39, c, 102, 2, f, the, tonsils, may, appear, red, and, enlarged, and, are, typically, covered, in, exudate, the, throat, may, be, red, with, small, red, spots, on, the, roof, of, the, mouth, the, uvula, can, look, red, and, swollen, 30, to, 60, of, cases, have, associated, enlarged, and, tender, lymph, nodes, in, the, neck, during, the, first, two, days, of, illness, the, tongue, may, have, a, whitish, coating, from, which, red, swollen, papillae, protrude, giving, the, appearance, of, a, white, strawberry, tongue, after, four, to, five, days, when, the, white, coating, sheds, it, becomes, a, red, strawberry, tongue, the, symptomatic, appearance, of, the, tongue, is, part, of, the, rash, that, is, characteristic, of, scarlet, fever, the, characteristic, rash, has, been, denoted, as, scarlatiniform, and, it, appears, as, a, diffuse, redness, of, the, skin, with, small, bumps, resembling, goose, bumps, it, typically, appears, as, small, flat, spots, on, the, neck, or, torso, before, developing, into, small, bumps, that, spread, to, the, arms, and, legs, it, tends, to, feel, rough, like, sandpaper, the, cheeks, might, look, flushed, with, a, pale, area, around, the, mouth, the, scarlet, fever, rash, generally, looks, red, on, white, and, pale, skin, and, might, be, difficult, to, visualise, on, brown, or, black, skin, in, whom, the, bumps, are, typically, larger, the, skin, less, like, sandpaper, and, the, perioral, pallor, less, obvious, the, palms, and, soles, are, spared, the, reddened, skin, blanches, when, pressure, is, applied, to, it, the, skin, may, feel, itchy, but, is, not, painful, a, more, intense, redness, on, the, inside, of, skin, folds, and, creases, might, be, noticed, these, are, lines, of, petechiae, appearing, as, pink, red, areas, located, in, arm, pits, and, elbow, pits, it, takes, around, a, week, for, the, main, rash, to, disappear, this, may, be, followed, by, several, weeks, of, peeling, of, the, skin, of, typically, fingers, and, toes, the, desquamation, process, usually, begins, on, the, face, and, progresses, downward, on, the, body, sometimes, this, peeling, is, the, only, sign, that, scarlet, fever, occurred, if, the, case, of, scarlet, fever, is, uncomplicated, recovery, from, the, fever, and, clinical, symptoms, other, than, the, process, of, desquamation, occurs, in, 5, 10, days, after, the, desquamation, the, skin, will, be, left, with, a, sunburned, appearance, children, younger, than, five, years, old, may, have, atypical, presentations, children, younger, than, 3, years, old, can, present, with, nasal, congestion, and, a, lower, grade, fever, infants, may, present, with, symptoms, of, increased, irritability, and, decreased, appetite, the, complications, which, can, arise, from, scarlet, fever, when, left, untreated, or, inadequately, treated, can, be, divided, into, two, categories, suppurative, and, nonsuppurative, suppurative, complications, these, are, rare, complications, that, arise, either, from, direct, spread, to, structures, that, are, close, to, the, primary, site, of, infection, or, spread, through, the, lymphatic, system, or, blood, in, the, first, case, scarlet, fever, may, spread, to, the, pharynx, possible, problems, from, this, method, of, spread, include, peritonsillar, or, retropharyngeal, abscesses, cellulitis, mastoiditis, or, sinusitis, in, the, second, case, the, streptococcal, infection, may, spread, through, the, lymphatic, system, or, the, blood, to, areas, of, the, body, further, away, from, the, pharynx, a, few, examples, of, the, many, complications, that, can, arise, from, those, methods, of, spread, include, endocarditis, pneumonia, or, meningitis, nonsuppurative, complications, these, complications, arise, from, certain, subtypes, of, group, a, streptococci, that, cause, an, autoimmune, response, in, the, body, through, what, has, been, termed, molecular, mimicry, in, these, cases, the, antibodies, which, the, person, s, immune, system, developed, to, attack, the, group, a, streptococci, are, also, able, to, attack, the, person, s, own, tissues, the, following, complications, result, depending, on, which, tissues, in, the, person, s, body, are, targeted, by, those, antibodies, strep, throat, spreads, by, close, contact, among, people, via, respiratory, droplets, for, example, saliva, or, nasal, discharge, a, person, in, close, contact, with, another, person, infected, with, group, a, streptococcal, pharyngitis, has, a, 35, chance, of, becoming, infected, one, in, ten, children, who, are, infected, with, group, a, streptococcal, pharyngitis, will, develop, scarlet, fever, the, rash, of, scarlet, fever, which, is, what, differentiates, this, disease, from, an, isolated, group, a, strep, pharyngitis, or, strep, throat, is, caused, by, specific, strains, of, group, a, streptococcus, that, produce, a, streptococcal, pyrogenic, exotoxin, which, is, mainly, responsible, for, the, skin, manifestation, of, the, infection, these, toxin, producing, strains, cause, scarlet, fever, in, people, who, do, not, already, have, antitoxin, antibodies, streptococcal, pyrogenic, exotoxins, spes, a, b, c, and, f, have, been, identified, the, pyrogenic, exotoxins, also, called, erythrogenic, toxins, cause, the, erythematous, rash, of, scarlet, fever, the, strains, of, group, a, streptococcus, that, cause, scarlet, fever, need, specific, bacteriophages, for, there, to, be, pyrogenic, exotoxin, production, specifically, bacteriophage, t12, is, responsible, for, the, production, of, spea, streptococcal, pyrogenic, exotoxin, a, spea, is, the, one, most, commonly, associated, with, cases, of, scarlet, fever, that, are, complicated, by, the, immune, mediated, sequelae, of, acute, rheumatic, fever, and, post, streptococcal, glomerulonephritis, these, toxins, are, also, known, as, superantigens, because, they, can, cause, an, extensive, immune, response, by, activating, some, of, the, cells, that, are, mainly, responsible, for, the, person, s, immune, system, although, the, body, responds, to, the, toxins, it, encounters, by, making, antibodies, those, antibodies, will, only, protect, against, that, particular, subset, of, toxins, they, will, not, necessarily, completely, protect, a, person, from, future, group, a, streptococcal, infections, because, there, are, 12, different, pyrogenic, exotoxins, that, may, be, produced, by, the, disease, and, future, infections, may, produce, a, different, subset, of, those, toxins, the, disease, is, caused, by, secretion, of, pyrogenic, exotoxins, by, the, infecting, streptococcus, bacteria, streptococcal, pyrogenic, exotoxin, a, spea, is, probably, the, best, studied, of, these, toxins, it, is, carried, by, the, bacteriophage, t12, which, integrates, into, the, streptococcal, genome, from, where, the, toxin, is, transcribed, the, phage, itself, integrates, into, a, serine, trna, gene, on, the, chromosome, the, t12, virus, itself, has, not, been, placed, into, a, taxon, by, the, international, committee, on, taxonomy, of, viruses, it, has, a, double, stranded, dna, genome, and, on, morphological, grounds, appears, to, be, a, member, of, the, siphoviridae, the, spea, gene, was, cloned, and, sequenced, in, 1986, it, is, 753, base, pairs, in, length, and, encodes, a, 29, 244, kilodalton, kda, protein, the, protein, contains, a, putative, 30, amino, acid, signal, peptide, removal, of, the, signal, sequence, gives, a, predicted, molecular, weight, of, 25, 787, kda, for, the, secreted, protein, both, a, promoter, and, a, ribosome, binding, site, shine, dalgarno, sequence, are, present, upstream, of, the, gene, a, transcriptional, terminator, is, located, 69, bases, downstream, from, the, translational, termination, codon, the, carboxy, terminal, portion, of, the, protein, exhibits, extensive, homology, with, the, carboxy, terminus, of, staphylococcus, aureus, enterotoxins, b, and, c1, streptococcal, phages, other, than, t12, may, also, carry, the, spea, gene, although, the, presentation, of, scarlet, fever, can, be, clinically, diagnosed, further, testing, may, be, required, to, distinguish, it, from, other, illnesses, also, history, of, a, recent, exposure, to, someone, with, strep, throat, can, be, useful, in, diagnosis, there, are, two, methods, used, to, confirm, suspicion, of, scarlet, fever, rapid, antigen, detection, test, and, throat, culture, the, rapid, antigen, detection, test, is, a, very, specific, test, but, not, very, sensitive, this, means, that, if, the, result, is, positive, indicating, that, the, group, a, strep, antigen, was, detected, and, therefore, confirming, that, the, person, has, a, group, a, strep, pharyngitis, then, it, is, appropriate, to, treat, the, people, with, scarlet, fever, with, antibiotics, but, if, the, rapid, antigen, detection, test, is, negative, indicating, that, they, do, not, have, group, a, strep, pharyngitis, then, a, throat, culture, is, required, to, confirm, as, the, first, test, could, have, yielded, a, false, negative, result, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, throat, culture, is, the, current, gold, standard, for, diagnosis, serologic, testing, seeks, evidence, of, the, antibodies, that, the, body, produces, against, the, streptococcal, infection, including, antistreptolysin, o, and, antideoxyribonuclease, b, it, takes, the, body, 2, 3, weeks, to, make, these, antibodies, so, this, type, of, testing, is, not, useful, for, diagnosing, a, current, infection, but, it, is, useful, when, assessing, a, person, who, may, have, one, of, the, complications, from, a, previous, streptococcal, infection, throat, cultures, done, after, antibiotic, therapy, can, show, if, the, infection, has, been, removed, these, throat, swabs, however, are, not, indicated, because, up, to, 25, of, properly, treated, individuals, can, continue, to, carry, the, streptococcal, infection, while, being, asymptomatic, scarlet, fever, might, appear, similar, to, kawasaki, disease, which, has, a, characteristic, red, but, not, white, strawberry, tongue, and, staphylococcal, scarlatina, which, does, not, have, the, strawberry, tongue, at, all, other, conditions, that, might, appear, similar, include, impetigo, erysipelas, measles, chickenpox, and, hand, foot, and, mouth, disease, and, may, be, distinguished, by, the, pattern, of, symptoms, one, method, is, long, term, use, of, antibiotics, to, prevent, future, group, a, streptococcal, infections, this, method, is, only, indicated, for, people, who, have, had, complications, like, recurrent, attacks, of, acute, rheumatic, fever, or, rheumatic, heart, disease, antibiotics, are, limited, in, their, ability, to, prevent, these, infections, since, there, are, a, variety, of, subtypes, of, group, a, streptococci, that, can, cause, the, infection, although, there, are, currently, no, vaccines, available, the, vaccine, approach, has, a, greater, likelihood, of, effectively, preventing, group, a, streptococcal, infections, in, the, future, because, vaccine, formulations, can, target, multiple, subtypes, of, the, bacteria, a, vaccine, developed, by, george, and, gladys, dick, in, 1924, was, discontinued, due, to, poor, efficacy, and, the, introduction, of, antibiotics, difficulties, in, vaccine, development, include, the, considerable, strain, variety, of, group, a, streptococci, present, in, the, environment, and, the, amount, of, time, and, number, of, people, needed, for, appropriate, trials, for, safety, and, efficacy, of, any, potential, vaccine, there, have, been, several, attempts, to, create, a, vaccine, in, the, past, few, decades, these, vaccines, which, are, still, in, the, development, phase, expose, the, person, to, proteins, present, on, the, surface, of, the, group, a, streptococci, to, activate, an, immune, response, that, will, prepare, the, person, to, fight, and, prevent, future, infections, there, used, to, be, a, diphtheria, scarlet, fever, vaccine, it, was, however, found, not, to, be, effective, this, product, was, discontinued, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, antibiotics, to, combat, the, streptococcal, infection, are, the, mainstay, of, treatment, for, scarlet, fever, prompt, administration, of, appropriate, antibiotics, decreases, the, length, of, illness, peeling, of, the, outer, layer, of, skin, however, will, happen, despite, treatment, one, of, the, main, goals, of, treatment, is, to, prevent, the, child, from, developing, one, of, the, suppurative, or, nonsuppurative, complications, especially, acute, rheumatic, fever, as, long, as, antibiotics, are, started, within, nine, days, it, is, very, unlikely, for, the, child, to, develop, acute, rheumatic, fever, antibiotic, therapy, has, not, been, shown, to, prevent, the, development, of, post, streptococcal, glomerulonephritis, another, important, reason, for, prompt, treatment, with, antibiotics, is, the, ability, to, prevent, transmission, of, the, infection, between, children, an, infected, individual, is, most, likely, to, pass, on, the, infection, to, another, person, during, the, first, two, weeks, a, child, is, no, longer, contagious, able, to, pass, the, infection, to, another, child, after, 24, hours, of, antibiotics, the, antibiotic, of, choice, is, penicillin, v, which, is, taken, by, mouth, in, countries, without, a, liquid, penicillin, v, product, children, unable, to, take, tablets, can, be, given, amoxicillin, which, comes, in, a, liquid, form, and, is, equally, effective, duration, of, treatment, is, 10, days, benzathine, penicillin, g, can, be, given, as, a, one, time, intramuscular, injection, as, another, alternative, if, swallowing, pills, is, not, possible, if, the, person, is, allergic, to, the, family, of, antibiotics, which, both, penicillin, and, amoxicillin, are, a, part, of, beta, lactam, antibiotics, a, first, generation, cephalosporin, is, used, cephalosporin, antibiotics, however, can, still, cause, adverse, reactions, in, people, whose, allergic, reaction, to, penicillin, is, a, type, 1, hypersensitivity, reaction, in, those, cases, it, is, appropriate, to, choose, clindamycin, or, erythromycin, instead, tonsillectomy, although, once, a, reasonable, treatment, for, recurrent, streptococcal, pharyngitis, is, not, indicated, as, a, person, can, still, be, infected, with, group, a, streptococcus, without, their, tonsils, a, drug, resistant, strain, of, scarlet, fever, resistant, to, macrolide, antibiotics, such, as, erythromycin, but, retaining, drug, sensitivity, to, beta, lactam, antibiotics, such, as, penicillin, emerged, in, hong, kong, in, 2011, accounting, for, at, least, two, deaths, in, that, city, the, first, such, in, over, a, decade, about, 60, of, circulating, strains, of, the, group, a, streptococcus, that, cause, scarlet, fever, in, hong, kong, are, resistant, to, macrolide, antibiotics, according, to, professor, yuen, kwok, yung, head, of, hong, kong, university, s, microbiology, department, previously, observed, resistance, rates, had, been, 10, 30, the, increase, is, likely, the, result, of, overuse, of, macrolide, antibiotics, in, recent, years, there, was, also, an, outbreak, in, the, uk, in, 2014, and, the, national, health, service, reported, a, 68, increase, in, the, number, of, s, pyogenes, identified, in, laboratory, reports, between, 2014, and, 2018, new, research, published, in, october, 2020, indicates, that, the, bacterium, appears, to, be, getting, more, robust, after, being, infected, with, viruses, specifically, the, north, east, asian, serotype, m12, emm12, group, a, streptococcus, gas, they, found, three, new, genes, acquired, from, viruses, which, cause, development, of, superantigens, targeting, white, blood, cells, resulting, in, a, more, virulent, strain, of, the, bacterium, a, vaccine, that, will, protect, against, the, 180, to, 200, types, of, bacteria, causing, the, disease, has, been, worked, on, for, over, 20, years, but, as, of, 2020, a, safe, one, had, not, yet, been, developed, scarlet, fever, occurs, equally, in, both, males, and, females, children, are, most, commonly, infected, typically, between, 5, 15, years, old, although, streptococcal, infections, can, happen, at, any, time, of, year, infection, rates, peak, in, the, winter, and, spring, months, typically, in, colder, climates, the, morbidity, and, mortality, of, scarlet, fever, has, declined, since, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, when, there, were, epidemics, of, this, disease, around, 1900, the, mortality, rate, in, multiple, places, reached, 25, the, improvement, in, prognosis, can, be, attributed, to, the, use, of, penicillin, in, the, treatment, of, this, disease, the, frequency, of, scarlet, fever, cases, has, also, been, declining, over, the, past, century, there, have, been, several, reported, outbreaks, of, the, disease, in, various, countries, in, the, past, decade, the, reason, for, these, increases, remains, unclear, in, the, medical, community, between, 2013, and, 2016, population, rates, of, scarlet, fever, in, england, increased, from, 8, 2, to, 33, 2, per, 100, 000, and, hospital, admissions, for, scarlet, fever, increased, by, 97, further, increases, in, the, reporting, of, scarlet, fever, cases, have, been, noted, in, england, during, the, 2021, 2022, season, september, to, september, and, so, far, also, in, the, season, 2022, 2023, the, world, health, organization, has, reported, an, increase, in, scarlet, fever, and, igas, invasive, gas, cases, in, england, and, other, european, countries, during, this, time, increases, have, been, reported, in, france, and, ireland, in, the, us, cases, of, scarlet, fever, are, not, reported, but, as, of, december, 2022, the, cdc, was, looking, at, a, possible, increase, in, the, numbers, of, invasive, gas, infections, reported, in, children, in, late, december, 2022, the, cdc, s, health, alert, network, issued, an, advisory, on, the, reported, increases, in, invasive, gas, infections, it, is, unclear, when, a, description, of, this, disease, was, first, recorded, hippocrates, writing, around, 400, bc, described, the, condition, of, a, person, with, a, reddened, skin, and, fever, the, first, unambiguous, description, of, the, disease, in, the, medical, literature, appeared, in, the, 1553, book, de, tumoribus, praeter, naturam, by, the, sicilian, anatomist, and, physician, giovanni, filippo, ingrassia, where, he, referred, to, it, as, rossalia, he, also, made, a, point, to, distinguish, that, this, presentation, had, different, characteristics, from, measles, it, was, redescribed, by, johann, weyer, during, an, epidemic, in, lower, germany, between, 1564, and, 1565, he, referred, to, it, as, scarlatina, anginosa, the, first, unequivocal, description, of, scarlet, fever, appeared, in, a, book, by, joannes, coyttarus, of, poitiers, de, febre, purpura, epidemiale, et, contagiosa, libri, duo, which, was, published, in, 1578, in, paris, daniel, sennert, of, wittenberg, described, the, classical, scarlatinal, desquamation, in, 1572, and, was, also, the, first, to, describe, the, early, arthritis, scarlatinal, dropsy, and, ascites, associated, with, the, disease, in, 1675, the, term, that, has, been, commonly, used, to, refer, to, scarlet, fever, scarlatina, was, written, by, thomas, sydenham, an, english, physician, in, 1827, richard, bright, was, the, first, to, recognize, the, involvement, of, the, renal, system, in, scarlet, fever, the, association, between, streptococci, and, disease, was, first, described, in, 1874, by, theodor, billroth, discussing, people, with, skin, infections, billroth, also, coined, the, genus, name, streptococcus, in, 1884, friedrich, julius, rosenbach, edited, the, name, to, its, current, one, streptococcus, pyogenes, after, further, looking, at, the, bacteria, in, the, skin, lesions, the, organism, was, first, cultured, in, 1883, by, the, german, surgeon, friedrich, fehleisen, from, erysipelas, lesions, also, in, 1884, the, german, physician, friedrich, loeffler, was, the, first, to, show, the, presence, of, streptococci, in, the, throats, of, people, with, scarlet, fever, because, not, all, people, with, pharyngeal, streptococci, developed, scarlet, fever, these, findings, remained, controversial, for, some, time, the, association, between, streptococci, and, scarlet, fever, was, confirmed, by, alphonse, dochez, and, george, and, gladys, dick, in, the, early, 1900s, also, in, 1884, the, world, s, first, convalescent, home, for, people, with, scarlet, fever, was, opened, at, brockley, hill, stanmore, founded, by, mary, wardell, nil, filatov, in, 1895, and, clement, dukes, in, 1894, described, an, exanthematous, disease, which, they, thought, was, a, form, of, rubella, but, in, 1900, dukes, described, it, as, a, separate, illness, which, came, to, be, known, as, dukes, disease, filatov, s, disease, or, fourth, disease, however, in, 1979, keith, powell, identified, it, as, in, fact, the, same, illness, as, the, form, of, scarlet, fever, which, is, caused, by, staphylococcal, exotoxin, and, is, known, as, staphylococcal, scalded, skin, syndrome, scarlet, fever, serum, from, horses, blood, was, used, in, the, treatment, of, children, beginning, in, 1900, and, reduced, mortality, rates, significantly, in, 1906, austrian, pediatrician, clemens, von, pirquet, postulated, that, disease, causing, immune, complexes, were, responsible, for, the, nephritis, that, followed, scarlet, fever, bacteriophages, were, discovered, in, 1915, by, frederick, twort, his, work, was, overlooked, and, bacteriophages, were, later, rediscovered, by, felix, d, herelle, in, 1917, the, specific, association, of, scarlet, fever, with, the, group, a, streptococci, had, to, await, the, development, of, rebecca, lancefield, s, streptococcal, grouping, scheme, in, the, 1920s, george, and, gladys, dick, showed, that, cell, free, filtrates, could, induce, the,
