proboscidea, p, r, b, s, k, d, i, from, latin, proboscis, from, ancient, greek, probosk, s, elephant, s, trunk, is, a, taxonomic, order, of, afrotherian, mammals, containing, one, living, family, elephantidae, and, several, extinct, families, first, described, by, j, illiger, in, 1811, it, encompasses, the, elephants, and, their, close, relatives, three, species, of, elephant, are, currently, recognised, the, african, bush, elephant, the, african, forest, elephant, and, the, asian, elephant, extinct, members, of, proboscidea, include, the, deinotheres, mastodons, gomphotheres, and, stegodonts, the, family, elephantidae, also, contains, several, extinct, groups, including, mammoths, and, palaeoloxodon, proboscideans, include, some, of, the, largest, known, land, mammals, with, the, elephant, palaeoloxodon, namadicus, and, mastodon, mammut, borsoni, suggested, to, have, body, masses, surpassing, 16, tonnes, 35, 000, lb, rivalling, or, exceeding, paraceratheres, the, otherwise, largest, known, land, mammals, in, size, the, largest, extant, proboscidean, is, the, african, bush, elephant, with, a, world, record, of, size, of, 4, m, 13, 1, ft, at, the, shoulder, and, 10, 4, t, 11, 5, short, tons, in, addition, to, their, enormous, size, later, proboscideans, are, distinguished, by, tusks, and, long, muscular, trunks, which, were, less, developed, or, absent, in, early, proboscideans, over, 180, extinct, members, of, proboscidea, have, been, described, the, earliest, proboscideans, eritherium, and, phosphatherium, are, known, from, the, late, paleocene, of, africa, the, eocene, included, numidotherium, moeritherium, and, barytherium, from, africa, these, animals, were, relatively, small, and, some, like, moeritherium, and, barytherium, were, probably, amphibious, a, major, event, in, proboscidean, evolution, was, the, collision, of, afro, arabia, with, eurasia, during, the, early, miocene, around, 18, 19, million, years, ago, allowing, proboscideans, to, disperse, from, their, african, homeland, across, eurasia, and, later, around, 16, 15, million, years, ago, into, north, america, across, the, bering, land, bridge, proboscidean, groups, prominent, during, the, miocene, include, the, deinotheres, along, with, the, more, advanced, elephantimorphs, including, mammutids, mastodons, gomphotheres, amebelodontids, which, includes, the, shovel, tuskers, like, platybelodon, choerolophodontids, and, stegodontids, around, 10, million, years, ago, the, earliest, members, of, the, family, elephantidae, emerged, in, africa, having, originated, from, gomphotheres, the, late, miocene, saw, major, climatic, changes, which, resulted, in, the, decline, and, extinction, of, many, proboscidean, groups, such, as, amebelodontids, and, choerolophodontids, the, earliest, members, of, modern, genera, of, elephantidae, appeared, during, the, latest, miocene, early, pliocene, around, 6, 5, million, years, ago, the, elephantid, genera, elephas, which, includes, the, living, asian, elephant, and, mammuthus, mammoths, migrated, out, of, africa, during, the, late, pliocene, around, 3, 6, to, 3, 2, million, years, ago, over, the, course, of, the, early, pleistocene, all, non, elephantid, probobscideans, outside, of, the, americas, became, extinct, including, mammutids, gomphotheres, and, deinotheres, with, the, exception, of, stegodon, gomphotheres, dispersed, into, south, america, during, this, era, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, and, mammoths, migrating, into, north, america, around, 1, 5, million, years, ago, at, the, end, of, the, early, pleistocene, around, 800, 000, years, ago, the, elephantid, genus, palaeoloxodon, dispersed, outside, of, africa, becoming, widely, distributed, in, eurasia, by, the, beginning, of, the, late, pleistocene, proboscideans, were, represented, by, around, 23, species, proboscideans, underwent, a, dramatic, decline, during, the, late, pleistocene, as, part, of, the, late, pleistocene, megafauna, extinctions, with, all, remaining, non, elephantid, proboscideans, including, stegodon, mastodons, and, the, american, gomphotheres, cuvieronius, and, notiomastodon, and, palaeoloxodon, becoming, extinct, with, mammoths, only, surviving, in, relict, populations, on, islands, around, the, bering, strait, into, the, holocene, with, their, latest, survival, being, on, wrangel, island, around, 4, 000, years, ago, the, following, cladogram, is, based, on, endocasts, phosphatherium, esculliei, numidotherium, koholense, moeritherium, lyonsi, deinotheriidae, palaeomastodon, beadnelli, mammut, americanum, zygolophodon, borsoni, choerolophodon, pentelici, gomphotherium, augustidens, cuvieronius, andium, stegomastodon, humboldti, stegodon, insignis, mammuthus, meridionalis, mammuthus, primigenius, mammuthus, columbi, elephas, maximus, loxodonta, africana, palaeoloxodon, antiquus, palaeoloxodon, falconeri, over, the, course, of, their, evolution, proboscideans, experienced, a, significant, increase, in, body, size, some, members, of, the, families, deinotheriidae, mammutidae, stegodontidae, and, elephantidae, are, thought, to, have, exceeded, modern, elephants, in, size, with, shoulder, heights, over, 4, metres, 13, ft, and, masses, over, 10, tonnes, 22, 000, lb, with, average, fully, grown, males, of, the, mammutid, mammut, borsoni, having, an, estimated, body, mass, of, 16, tonnes, 35, 000, lb, making, it, one, the, largest, and, perhaps, the, largest, land, mammal, ever, with, a, fragmentary, specimen, of, the, indian, elephant, species, palaeoloxodon, namadicus, only, known, from, a, partial, femur, being, speculatively, estimated, in, the, same, study, to, have, possibly, reached, a, body, mass, of, 22, tonnes, 49, 000, lb, as, with, other, megaherbivores, including, the, extinct, sauropod, dinosaurs, the, large, size, of, proboscideans, likely, developed, to, allow, them, to, survive, on, vegetation, with, low, nutritional, value, their, limbs, grew, longer, and, the, feet, shorter, and, broader, the, feet, were, originally, plantigrade, and, developed, into, a, digitigrade, stance, with, cushion, pads, and, the, sesamoid, bone, providing, support, with, this, change, developing, around, the, common, ancestor, of, deinotheriidae, and, elephantiformes, members, of, elephantiformes, which, have, retracted, nasal, regions, of, the, skull, indicating, the, development, of, a, trunk, as, well, as, well, developed, tusks, on, the, upper, and, lower, jaws, the, skull, grew, larger, especially, the, cranium, while, the, neck, shortened, to, provide, better, support, for, the, skull, the, increase, in, size, led, to, the, development, and, elongation, of, the, mobile, trunk, to, provide, reach, the, number, of, premolars, incisors, and, canines, decreased, the, cheek, teeth, molars, and, premolars, became, larger, and, more, specialised, in, elephantiformes, the, second, upper, incisor, and, lower, incisor, were, transformed, into, ever, growing, tusks, the, tusks, are, proportionally, heavy, for, their, size, being, primarily, composed, of, dentine, in, primitive, proboscideans, a, band, of, enamel, covers, part, of, the, tusk, surface, though, in, many, later, groups, including, modern, elephants, the, band, is, lost, with, elephants, only, having, enamel, on, the, tusk, tips, of, juveniles, the, upper, tusks, were, initially, modest, in, size, but, from, the, late, miocene, onwards, proboscideans, developed, increasingly, large, tusks, with, the, longest, ever, recorded, tusk, being, 5, 02, metres, 16, 5, ft, long, belonging, to, the, mammutid, mammut, borsoni, found, in, greece, with, some, mammoth, tusks, likely, weighing, over, 200, kilograms, 440, lb, the, lower, tusks, are, generally, smaller, than, the, upper, tusks, but, could, grow, to, large, sizes, in, some, species, like, in, deinotherium, which, lacks, upper, tusks, where, they, could, grow, over, 1, 5, metres, 4, 9, ft, long, the, amebelodontid, konobelodon, has, lower, tusks, 1, 61, metres, 5, 3, ft, long, with, the, longest, lower, tusks, ever, recorded, being, from, the, primitive, elephantid, stegotetrabelodon, which, are, around, 2, 2, metres, 7, 2, ft, long, the, molar, teeth, changed, from, being, replaced, vertically, as, in, other, mammals, to, being, replaced, horizontally, in, the, clade, elephantimorpha, while, early, elephantimorpha, generally, had, lower, jaws, with, an, elongated, mandibular, symphysis, at, the, front, of, the, jaw, with, well, developed, lower, tusks, incisors, from, the, late, miocene, onwards, many, groups, convergently, developed, brevirostrine, shortened, lower, jaws, with, vestigial, or, no, lower, tusks, elephantids, are, distinguished, from, other, proboscideans, by, a, major, shift, in, the, molar, morphology, to, parallel, lophs, rather, than, the, cusps, of, earlier, proboscideans, allowing, them, to, become, higher, crowned, hypsodont, and, more, efficient, in, consuming, grass, several, species, of, proboscideans, lived, on, islands, and, experienced, insular, dwarfism, this, occurred, primarily, during, the, pleistocene, when, some, elephant, populations, became, isolated, by, fluctuating, sea, levels, although, dwarf, elephants, did, exist, earlier, in, the, pliocene, these, elephants, likely, grew, smaller, on, islands, due, to, a, lack, of, large, or, viable, predator, populations, and, limited, resources, by, contrast, small, mammals, such, as, rodents, develop, gigantism, in, these, conditions, dwarf, proboscideans, are, known, to, have, lived, in, indonesia, the, channel, islands, of, california, and, several, islands, of, the, mediterranean, elephas, celebensis, of, sulawesi, is, believed, to, have, descended, from, elephas, planifrons, elephas, falconeri, of, malta, and, sicily, was, only, 1, m, 3, ft, and, had, probably, evolved, from, the, straight, tusked, elephant, other, descendants, of, the, straight, tusked, elephant, existed, in, cyprus, dwarf, elephants, of, uncertain, descent, lived, in, crete, cyclades, and, dodecanese, while, dwarf, mammoths, are, known, to, have, lived, in, sardinia, the, columbian, mammoth, colonised, the, channel, islands, and, evolved, into, the, pygmy, mammoth, this, species, reached, a, height, of, 1, 2, 1, 8, m, 4, 6, ft, and, weighed, 200, 2, 000, kg, 440, 4, 410, lb, a, population, of, small, woolly, mammoths, survived, on, wrangel, island, as, recently, as, 4, 000, years, ago, after, their, discovery, in, 1993, they, were, considered, dwarf, mammoths, this, classification, has, been, re, evaluated, and, since, the, second, international, mammoth, conference, in, 1999, these, animals, are, no, longer, considered, to, be, true, dwarf, mammoths, it, has, been, suggested, that, members, of, elephantimorpha, including, mammutids, gomphotheres, and, stegodontids, lived, in, herds, like, modern, elephants, analysis, of, remains, of, the, american, mastodon, mammut, americanum, suggest, that, like, modern, elephants, that, herds, consisted, of, females, and, juveniles, and, that, adult, males, lived, solitarily, or, in, small, groups, and, that, adult, males, periodically, engaged, in, fights, with, other, males, during, periods, similar, to, musth, found, in, living, elephants, these, traits, are, suggested, to, be, inherited, from, the, last, common, ancestor, of, elephantimorphs, with, musth, like, behaviour, also, suggested, to, have, occurred, in, gomphotheres, all, elephantimorphs, are, suggested, to, have, been, capable, of, communication, via, infrasound, as, found, in, living, elephants, deinotheres, may, have, also, lived, in, herds, based, on, tracks, found, in, the, late, miocene, of, romania, over, the, course, of, the, neogene, and, pleistocene, various, members, of, elephantida, shifted, from, a, browse, dominated, diet, towards, mixed, feeding, or, grazing, below, is, an, unranked, taxonomy, of, proboscidean, genera, as, of, 2019
