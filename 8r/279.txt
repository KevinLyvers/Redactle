a, flagellum, f, l, d, l, m, pl, flagella, latin, for, whip, or, scourge, is, a, hairlike, appendage, that, protrudes, from, certain, plant, and, animal, sperm, cells, from, fungal, spores, zoospores, and, from, a, wide, range, of, microorganisms, to, provide, motility, many, protists, with, flagella, are, known, as, flagellates, a, microorganism, may, have, from, one, to, many, flagella, a, gram, negative, bacterium, helicobacter, pylori, for, example, uses, its, flagella, to, propel, itself, through, the, stomach, to, reach, the, mucus, lining, where, it, may, colonise, the, epithelium, and, potentially, cause, gastritis, and, ulcers, a, risk, factor, for, stomach, cancer, in, some, swarming, bacteria, the, flagellum, can, also, function, as, a, sensory, organelle, being, sensitive, to, wetness, outside, the, cell, across, the, three, domains, of, bacteria, archaea, and, eukaryota, the, flagellum, has, a, different, structure, protein, composition, and, mechanism, of, propulsion, but, shares, the, same, function, of, providing, motility, the, latin, word, flagellum, means, whip, to, describe, its, lash, like, swimming, motion, the, flagellum, in, archaea, is, called, the, archaellum, to, note, its, difference, from, the, bacterial, flagellum, eukaryotic, flagella, and, cilia, are, identical, in, structure, but, have, different, lengths, and, functions, prokaryotic, fimbriae, and, pili, are, smaller, and, thinner, appendages, with, different, functions, the, three, types, of, flagella, are, bacterial, archaeal, and, eukaryotic, the, flagella, in, eukaryotes, have, dynein, and, microtubules, that, move, with, a, bending, mechanism, bacteria, and, archaea, do, not, have, dynein, or, microtubules, in, their, flagella, and, they, move, using, a, rotary, mechanism, other, differences, among, these, three, types, are, the, bacterial, flagellum, is, made, up, of, protein, subunits, of, flagellin, its, shape, is, a, 20, nanometer, thick, hollow, tube, it, is, helical, and, has, a, sharp, bend, just, outside, the, outer, membrane, this, hook, allows, the, axis, of, the, helix, to, point, directly, away, from, the, cell, a, shaft, runs, between, the, hook, and, the, basal, body, passing, through, protein, rings, in, the, cell, s, membrane, that, act, as, bearings, gram, positive, organisms, have, two, of, these, basal, body, rings, one, in, the, peptidoglycan, layer, and, one, in, the, plasma, membrane, gram, negative, organisms, have, four, such, rings, the, l, ring, associates, with, the, lipopolysaccharides, the, p, ring, associates, with, peptidoglycan, layer, the, m, ring, is, embedded, in, the, plasma, membrane, and, the, s, ring, is, directly, attached, to, the, cytoplasm, the, filament, ends, with, a, capping, protein, the, flagellar, filament, is, the, long, helical, screw, that, propels, the, bacterium, when, rotated, by, the, motor, through, the, hook, in, most, bacteria, that, have, been, studied, including, the, gram, negative, escherichia, coli, salmonella, typhimurium, caulobacter, crescentus, and, vibrio, alginolyticus, the, filament, is, made, up, of, 11, protofilaments, approximately, parallel, to, the, filament, axis, each, protofilament, is, a, series, of, tandem, protein, chains, however, campylobacter, jejuni, has, seven, protofilaments, the, basal, body, has, several, traits, in, common, with, some, types, of, secretory, pores, such, as, the, hollow, rod, like, plug, in, their, centers, extending, out, through, the, plasma, membrane, the, similarities, between, bacterial, flagella, and, bacterial, secretory, system, structures, and, proteins, provide, scientific, evidence, supporting, the, theory, that, bacterial, flagella, evolved, from, the, type, three, secretion, system, ttss, the, atomic, structure, of, both, bacterial, flagella, as, well, as, the, ttss, injectisome, have, been, elucidated, in, great, detail, especially, with, the, development, of, cryo, electron, microscopy, the, best, understood, parts, are, the, parts, between, the, inner, and, outer, membrane, that, is, the, scaffolding, rings, of, the, inner, membrane, im, the, scaffolding, pairs, of, the, outer, membrane, om, and, the, rod, needle, injectisome, or, rod, hook, flagellum, sections, the, bacterial, flagellum, is, driven, by, a, rotary, engine, mot, complex, made, up, of, protein, located, at, the, flagellum, s, anchor, point, on, the, inner, cell, membrane, the, engine, is, powered, by, proton, motive, force, i, e, by, the, flow, of, protons, hydrogen, ions, across, the, bacterial, cell, membrane, due, to, a, concentration, gradient, set, up, by, the, cell, s, metabolism, vibrio, species, have, two, kinds, of, flagella, lateral, and, polar, and, some, are, driven, by, a, sodium, ion, pump, rather, than, a, proton, pump, the, rotor, transports, protons, across, the, membrane, and, is, turned, in, the, process, the, rotor, alone, can, operate, at, 6, 000, to, 100, 000, rpm, but, with, the, flagellar, filament, attached, usually, only, reaches, 200, to, 1000, rpm, the, direction, of, rotation, can, be, changed, by, the, flagellar, motor, switch, almost, instantaneously, caused, by, a, slight, change, in, the, position, of, a, protein, flig, in, the, rotor, the, flagellum, is, highly, energy, efficient, and, uses, very, little, energy, the, torque, is, transferred, from, the, motab, to, the, torque, helix, on, flig, s, d5, domain, and, with, the, increase, in, the, requirement, of, the, torque, or, speed, more, motab, are, employed, because, the, flagellar, motor, has, no, on, off, switch, the, protein, epse, is, used, as, a, mechanical, clutch, to, disengage, the, motor, from, the, rotor, thus, stopping, the, flagellum, and, allowing, the, bacterium, to, remain, in, one, place, the, cylindrical, shape, of, flagella, is, suited, to, locomotion, of, microscopic, organisms, these, organisms, operate, at, a, low, reynolds, number, where, the, viscosity, of, the, surrounding, water, is, much, more, important, than, its, mass, or, inertia, the, rotational, speed, of, flagella, varies, in, response, to, the, intensity, of, the, proton, motive, force, thereby, permitting, certain, forms, of, speed, control, and, also, permitting, some, types, of, bacteria, to, attain, remarkable, speeds, in, proportion, to, their, size, some, achieve, roughly, 60, cell, lengths, per, second, at, such, a, speed, a, bacterium, would, take, about, 245, days, to, cover, 1, km, although, that, may, seem, slow, the, perspective, changes, when, the, concept, of, scale, is, introduced, in, comparison, to, macroscopic, life, forms, it, is, very, fast, indeed, when, expressed, in, terms, of, number, of, body, lengths, per, second, a, cheetah, for, example, only, achieves, about, 25, body, lengths, per, second, through, use, of, their, flagella, bacteria, are, able, to, move, rapidly, towards, attractants, and, away, from, repellents, by, means, of, a, biased, random, walk, with, runs, and, tumbles, brought, about, by, rotating, its, flagellum, counterclockwise, and, clockwise, respectively, the, two, directions, of, rotation, are, not, identical, with, respect, to, flagellum, movement, and, are, selected, by, a, molecular, switch, clockwise, rotation, is, called, the, traction, mode, with, the, body, following, the, flagella, counterclockwise, rotation, is, called, the, thruster, mode, with, the, flagella, lagging, behind, the, body, during, flagellar, assembly, components, of, the, flagellum, pass, through, the, hollow, cores, of, the, basal, body, and, the, nascent, filament, during, assembly, protein, components, are, added, at, the, flagellar, tip, rather, than, at, the, base, in, vitro, flagellar, filaments, assemble, spontaneously, in, a, solution, containing, purified, flagellin, as, the, sole, protein, at, least, 10, protein, components, of, the, bacterial, flagellum, share, homologous, proteins, with, the, type, three, secretion, system, t3ss, found, in, many, gram, negative, bacteria, hence, one, likely, evolved, from, the, other, because, the, t3ss, has, a, similar, number, of, components, as, a, flagellar, apparatus, about, 25, proteins, which, one, evolved, first, is, difficult, to, determine, however, the, flagellar, system, appears, to, involve, more, proteins, overall, including, various, regulators, and, chaperones, hence, it, has, been, argued, that, flagella, evolved, from, a, t3ss, however, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, flagellum, may, have, evolved, first, or, the, two, structures, evolved, in, parallel, early, single, cell, organisms, need, for, motility, mobility, support, that, the, more, mobile, flagella, would, be, selected, by, evolution, first, but, the, t3ss, evolving, from, the, flagellum, can, be, seen, as, reductive, evolution, and, receives, no, topological, support, from, the, phylogenetic, trees, the, hypothesis, that, the, two, structures, evolved, separately, from, a, common, ancestor, accounts, for, the, protein, similarities, between, the, two, structures, as, well, as, their, functional, diversity, some, authors, have, argued, that, flagella, cannot, have, evolved, assuming, that, they, can, only, function, properly, when, all, proteins, are, in, place, in, other, words, the, flagellar, apparatus, is, irreducibly, complex, however, many, proteins, can, be, deleted, or, mutated, and, the, flagellum, still, works, though, sometimes, at, reduced, efficiency, moreover, with, many, proteins, unique, to, some, number, across, species, diversity, of, bacterial, flagella, composition, was, higher, than, expected, hence, the, flagellar, apparatus, is, clearly, very, flexible, in, evolutionary, terms, and, perfectly, able, to, lose, or, gain, protein, components, for, instance, a, number, of, mutations, have, been, found, that, increase, the, motility, of, e, coli, additional, evidence, for, the, evolution, of, bacterial, flagella, includes, the, existence, of, vestigial, flagella, intermediate, forms, of, flagella, and, patterns, of, similarities, among, flagellar, protein, sequences, including, the, observation, that, almost, all, of, the, core, flagellar, proteins, have, known, homologies, with, non, flagellar, proteins, furthermore, several, processes, have, been, identified, as, playing, important, roles, in, flagellar, evolution, including, self, assembly, of, simple, repeating, subunits, gene, duplication, with, subsequent, divergence, recruitment, of, elements, from, other, systems, molecular, bricolage, and, recombination, different, species, of, bacteria, have, different, numbers, and, arrangements, of, flagella, named, using, the, term, tricho, from, the, greek, trichos, meaning, hair, counterclockwise, rotation, of, a, monotrichous, polar, flagellum, pushes, the, cell, forward, with, the, flagellum, trailing, behind, much, like, a, corkscrew, moving, inside, cork, water, on, the, microscopic, scale, is, highly, viscous, unlike, usual, water, spirochetes, in, contrast, have, flagella, called, endoflagella, arising, from, opposite, poles, of, the, cell, and, are, located, within, the, periplasmic, space, as, shown, by, breaking, the, outer, membrane, and, also, by, electron, cryotomography, microscopy, the, rotation, of, the, filaments, relative, to, the, cell, body, causes, the, entire, bacterium, to, move, forward, in, a, corkscrew, like, motion, even, through, material, viscous, enough, to, prevent, the, passage, of, normally, flagellated, bacteria, in, certain, large, forms, of, selenomonas, more, than, 30, individual, flagella, are, organized, outside, the, cell, body, helically, twining, about, each, other, to, form, a, thick, structure, easily, visible, with, the, light, microscope, called, a, fascicle, in, some, vibrio, spp, particularly, vibrio, parahaemolyticus, and, related, bacteria, such, as, aeromonas, two, flagellar, systems, co, exist, using, different, sets, of, genes, and, different, ion, gradients, for, energy, the, polar, flagella, are, constitutively, expressed, and, provide, motility, in, bulk, fluid, while, the, lateral, flagella, are, expressed, when, the, polar, flagella, meet, too, much, resistance, to, turn, these, provide, swarming, motility, on, surfaces, or, in, viscous, fluids, bundling, is, an, event, that, can, happen, in, multi, flagellated, cells, bundling, the, flagella, together, and, causing, them, to, rotate, in, a, coordinated, manner, flagella, are, left, handed, helices, and, when, rotated, counter, clockwise, by, their, rotors, they, can, bundle, and, rotate, together, when, the, rotors, reverse, direction, thus, rotating, clockwise, the, flagellum, unwinds, from, the, bundle, this, may, cause, the, cell, to, stop, its, forward, motion, and, instead, start, twitching, in, place, referred, to, as, tumbling, tumbling, results, in, a, stochastic, reorientation, of, the, cell, causing, it, to, change, the, direction, of, its, forward, swimming, it, is, not, known, which, stimuli, drive, the, switch, between, bundling, and, tumbling, but, the, motor, is, highly, adaptive, to, different, signals, in, the, model, describing, chemotaxis, movement, on, purpose, the, clockwise, rotation, of, a, flagellum, is, suppressed, by, chemical, compounds, favorable, to, the, cell, e, g, food, when, moving, in, a, favorable, direction, the, concentration, of, such, chemical, attractants, increases, and, therefore, tumbles, are, continually, suppressed, allowing, forward, motion, likewise, when, the, cell, s, direction, of, motion, is, unfavorable, e, g, away, from, a, chemical, attractant, tumbles, are, no, longer, suppressed, and, occur, much, more, often, with, the, chance, that, the, cell, will, be, thus, reoriented, in, the, correct, direction, even, if, all, flagella, would, rotate, clockwise, however, they, often, cannot, form, a, bundle, due, to, geometrical, and, hydrodynamic, reasons, aiming, to, emphasize, the, distinction, between, the, bacterial, flagella, and, the, eukaryotic, cilia, and, flagella, some, authors, attempted, to, replace, the, name, of, these, two, eukaryotic, structures, with, undulipodia, e, g, all, papers, by, margulis, since, the, 1970s, or, cilia, for, both, e, g, h, lsmann, 1992, adl, et, al, 2012, most, papers, of, cavalier, smith, preserving, flagella, for, the, bacterial, structure, however, the, discriminative, usage, of, the, terms, cilia, and, flagella, for, eukaryotes, adopted, in, this, article, see, flagella, versus, cilia, below, is, still, common, e, g, andersen, et, al, 1991, leadbeater, et, al, 2000, the, core, of, a, eukaryotic, flagellum, known, as, the, axoneme, is, a, bundle, of, nine, fused, pairs, of, microtubules, known, as, doublets, surrounding, two, central, single, microtubules, singlets, this, 9, 2, axoneme, is, characteristic, of, the, eukaryotic, flagellum, at, the, base, of, a, eukaryotic, flagellum, is, a, basal, body, blepharoplast, or, kinetosome, which, is, the, microtubule, organizing, center, for, flagellar, microtubules, and, is, about, 500, nanometers, long, basal, bodies, are, structurally, identical, to, centrioles, the, flagellum, is, encased, within, the, cell, s, plasma, membrane, so, that, the, interior, of, the, flagellum, is, accessible, to, the, cell, s, cytoplasm, besides, the, axoneme, and, basal, body, relatively, constant, in, morphology, other, internal, structures, of, the, flagellar, apparatus, are, the, transition, zone, where, the, axoneme, and, basal, body, meet, and, the, root, system, microtubular, or, fibrilar, structures, that, extend, from, the, basal, bodies, into, the, cytoplasm, more, variable, and, useful, as, indicators, of, phylogenetic, relationships, of, eukaryotes, other, structures, more, uncommon, are, the, paraflagellar, or, paraxial, paraxonemal, rod, the, r, fiber, and, the, s, fiber, 63, 84, for, surface, structures, see, below, each, of, the, outer, 9, doublet, microtubules, extends, a, pair, of, dynein, arms, an, inner, and, an, outer, arm, to, the, adjacent, microtubule, these, produce, force, through, atp, hydrolysis, the, flagellar, axoneme, also, contains, radial, spokes, polypeptide, complexes, extending, from, each, of, the, outer, nine, microtubule, doublets, towards, the, central, pair, with, the, head, of, the, spoke, facing, inwards, the, radial, spoke, is, thought, to, be, involved, in, the, regulation, of, flagellar, motion, although, its, exact, function, and, method, of, action, are, not, yet, understood, the, regular, beat, patterns, of, eukaryotic, cilia, and, flagella, generate, motion, on, a, cellular, level, examples, range, from, the, propulsion, of, single, cells, such, as, the, swimming, of, spermatozoa, to, the, transport, of, fluid, along, a, stationary, layer, of, cells, such, as, in, the, respiratory, tract, although, eukaryotic, cilia, and, flagella, are, ultimately, the, same, they, are, sometimes, classed, by, their, pattern, of, movement, a, tradition, from, before, their, structures, have, been, known, in, the, case, of, flagella, the, motion, is, often, planar, and, wave, like, whereas, the, motile, cilia, often, perform, a, more, complicated, three, dimensional, motion, with, a, power, and, recovery, stroke, yet, another, traditional, form, of, distinction, is, by, the, number, of, 9, 2, organelles, on, the, cell, intraflagellar, transport, the, process, by, which, axonemal, subunits, transmembrane, receptors, and, other, proteins, are, moved, up, and, down, the, length, of, the, flagellum, is, essential, for, proper, functioning, of, the, flagellum, in, both, motility, and, signal, transduction, eukaryotic, flagella, or, cilia, probably, an, ancestral, characteristic, are, widespread, in, almost, all, groups, of, eukaryotes, as, a, relatively, perennial, condition, or, as, a, flagellated, life, cycle, stage, e, g, zoids, gametes, zoospores, which, may, be, produced, continually, or, not, the, first, situation, is, found, either, in, specialized, cells, of, multicellular, organisms, e, g, the, choanocytes, of, sponges, or, the, ciliated, epithelia, of, metazoans, as, in, ciliates, and, many, eukaryotes, with, a, flagellate, condition, or, monadoid, level, of, organization, see, flagellata, an, artificial, group, flagellated, lifecycle, stages, are, found, in, many, groups, e, g, many, green, algae, zoospores, and, male, gametes, bryophytes, male, gametes, pteridophytes, male, gametes, some, gymnosperms, cycads, and, ginkgo, as, male, gametes, centric, diatoms, male, gametes, brown, algae, zoospores, and, gametes, oomycetes, assexual, zoospores, and, gametes, hyphochytrids, zoospores, labyrinthulomycetes, zoospores, some, apicomplexans, gametes, some, radiolarians, probably, gametes, foraminiferans, gametes, plasmodiophoromycetes, zoospores, and, gametes, myxogastrids, zoospores, metazoans, male, gametes, and, chytrid, fungi, zoospores, and, gametes, flagella, or, cilia, are, completely, absent, in, some, groups, probably, due, to, a, loss, rather, than, being, a, primitive, condition, the, loss, of, cilia, occurred, in, red, algae, some, green, algae, zygnematophyceae, the, gymnosperms, except, cycads, and, ginkgo, angiosperms, pennate, diatoms, some, apicomplexans, some, amoebozoans, in, the, sperm, of, some, metazoans, and, in, fungi, except, chytrids, a, number, of, terms, related, to, flagella, or, cilia, are, used, to, characterize, eukaryotes, 60, 63, according, to, surface, structures, present, flagella, may, be, according, to, the, number, of, flagella, cells, may, be, remembering, that, some, authors, use, ciliated, instead, of, flagellated, according, to, the, place, of, insertion, of, the, flagella, according, to, the, beating, pattern, other, terms, related, to, the, flagellar, type, the, archaellum, possessed, by, some, species, of, archaea, is, superficially, similar, to, the, bacterial, flagellum, in, the, 1980s, they, were, thought, to, be, homologous, on, the, basis, of, gross, morphology, and, behavior, both, flagella, and, archaella, consist, of, filaments, extending, outside, the, cell, and, rotate, to, propel, the, cell, archaeal, flagella, have, a, unique, structure, which, lacks, a, central, channel, similar, to, bacterial, type, iv, pilins, the, archaeal, proteins, archaellins, are, made, with, class, 3, signal, peptides, and, they, are, processed, by, a, type, iv, prepilin, peptidase, like, enzyme, the, archaellins, are, typically, modified, by, the, addition, of, n, linked, glycans, which, are, necessary, for, proper, assembly, or, function, discoveries, in, the, 1990s, revealed, numerous, detailed, differences, between, the, archaeal, and, bacterial, flagella, these, include, these, differences, support, the, theory, that, the, bacterial, flagella, and, archaella, are, a, classic, case, of, biological, analogy, or, convergent, evolution, rather, than, homology, research, into, the, structure, of, archaella, made, significant, progress, beginning, in, the, early, 2010s, with, the, first, atomic, resolution, structure, of, an, archaella, protein, the, discovery, of, additional, functions, of, archaella, and, the, first, reports, of, archaella, in, nanoarchaeota, and, thaumarchaeota, the, only, fungi, to, have, a, single, flagellum, on, their, spores, are, the, chytrids, in, batrachochytrium, dendrobatidis, the, flagellum, is, 19, 20, m, long, a, nonfunctioning, centriole, lies, adjacent, to, the, kinetosome, nine, interconnected, props, attach, the, kinetosome, to, the, plasmalemma, and, a, terminal, plate, is, present, in, the, transitional, zone, an,
