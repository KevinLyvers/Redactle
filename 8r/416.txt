butterflies, are, winged, insects, from, the, lepidopteran, suborder, rhopalocera, characterized, by, large, often, brightly, coloured, wings, that, often, fold, together, when, at, rest, and, a, conspicuous, fluttering, flight, the, group, comprises, the, superfamilies, hedyloidea, moth, butterflies, in, the, americas, and, papilionoidea, all, others, the, oldest, butterfly, fossils, have, been, dated, to, the, paleocene, about, 56, million, years, ago, though, they, likely, originated, in, the, late, cretaceous, about, 101, million, years, ago, butterflies, have, a, four, stage, life, cycle, and, like, other, holometabolous, insects, they, undergo, complete, metamorphosis, winged, adults, lay, eggs, on, the, food, plant, on, which, their, larvae, known, as, caterpillars, will, feed, the, caterpillars, grow, sometimes, very, rapidly, and, when, fully, developed, pupate, in, a, chrysalis, when, metamorphosis, is, complete, the, pupal, skin, splits, the, adult, insect, climbs, out, expands, its, wings, to, dry, and, flies, off, some, butterflies, especially, in, the, tropics, have, several, generations, in, a, year, while, others, have, a, single, generation, and, a, few, in, cold, locations, may, take, several, years, to, pass, through, their, entire, life, cycle, butterflies, are, often, polymorphic, and, many, species, make, use, of, camouflage, mimicry, and, aposematism, to, evade, their, predators, some, like, the, monarch, and, the, painted, lady, migrate, over, long, distances, many, butterflies, are, attacked, by, parasites, or, parasitoids, including, wasps, protozoans, flies, and, other, invertebrates, or, are, preyed, upon, by, other, organisms, some, species, are, pests, because, in, their, larval, stages, they, can, damage, domestic, crops, or, trees, other, species, are, agents, of, pollination, of, some, plants, larvae, of, a, few, butterflies, e, g, harvesters, eat, harmful, insects, and, a, few, are, predators, of, ants, while, others, live, as, mutualists, in, association, with, ants, culturally, butterflies, are, a, popular, motif, in, the, visual, and, literary, arts, the, smithsonian, institution, says, butterflies, are, certainly, one, of, the, most, appealing, creatures, in, nature, the, oxford, english, dictionary, derives, the, word, straightforwardly, from, old, english, butorfl, oge, butter, fly, similar, names, in, old, dutch, and, old, high, german, show, that, the, name, is, ancient, but, modern, dutch, and, german, use, different, words, vlinder, and, schmetterling, and, the, common, name, often, varies, substantially, between, otherwise, closely, related, languages, a, possible, source, of, the, name, is, the, bright, yellow, male, of, the, brimstone, gonepteryx, rhamni, another, is, that, butterflies, were, on, the, wing, in, meadows, during, the, spring, and, summer, butter, season, while, the, grass, was, growing, the, earliest, lepidoptera, fossils, date, to, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, around, 200, million, years, ago, butterflies, evolved, from, moths, so, while, the, butterflies, are, monophyletic, forming, a, single, clade, the, moths, are, not, the, oldest, known, butterfly, is, protocoeliades, kristenseni, from, the, palaeocene, aged, fur, formation, of, denmark, approximately, 55, million, years, old, which, belongs, to, the, family, hesperiidae, skippers, molecular, clock, estimates, suggest, that, butterflies, originated, sometime, in, the, late, cretaceous, but, only, significantly, diversified, during, the, cenozoic, with, one, study, suggesting, a, north, american, origin, for, the, group, the, oldest, american, butterfly, is, the, late, eocene, prodryas, persephone, from, the, florissant, fossil, beds, approximately, 34, million, years, old, butterflies, are, scientifically, classified, in, the, macrolepidopteran, suborder, clade, rhopalocera, from, the, order, lepidoptera, which, also, includes, moths, traditionally, butterflies, have, been, divided, into, the, superfamily, papilionoidea, excluding, the, smaller, groups, of, the, hesperiidae, skippers, and, the, more, moth, like, hedylidae, of, america, phylogenetic, analysis, suggests, that, the, traditional, papilionoidea, is, paraphyletic, with, respect, to, the, other, two, groups, so, they, should, both, be, included, within, papilionoidea, to, form, a, single, butterfly, group, thereby, synonymous, with, the, clade, rhopalocera, butterfly, adults, are, characterized, by, their, four, scale, covered, wings, which, give, the, lepidoptera, their, name, ancient, greek, lep, s, scale, pter, n, wing, these, scales, give, butterfly, wings, their, colour, they, are, pigmented, with, melanins, that, give, them, blacks, and, browns, as, well, as, uric, acid, derivatives, and, flavones, that, give, them, yellows, but, many, of, the, blues, greens, reds, and, iridescent, colours, are, created, by, structural, coloration, produced, by, the, micro, structures, of, the, scales, and, hairs, as, in, all, insects, the, body, is, divided, into, three, sections, the, head, thorax, and, abdomen, the, thorax, is, composed, of, three, segments, each, with, a, pair, of, legs, in, most, families, of, butterfly, the, antennae, are, clubbed, unlike, those, of, moths, which, may, be, threadlike, or, feathery, the, long, proboscis, can, be, coiled, when, not, in, use, for, sipping, nectar, from, flowers, nearly, all, butterflies, are, diurnal, have, relatively, bright, colours, and, hold, their, wings, vertically, above, their, bodies, when, at, rest, unlike, the, majority, of, moths, which, fly, by, night, are, often, cryptically, coloured, well, camouflaged, and, either, hold, their, wings, flat, touching, the, surface, on, which, the, moth, is, standing, or, fold, them, closely, over, their, bodies, some, day, flying, moths, such, as, the, hummingbird, hawk, moth, are, exceptions, to, these, rules, butterfly, larvae, caterpillars, have, a, hard, sclerotised, head, with, strong, mandibles, used, for, cutting, their, food, most, often, leaves, they, have, cylindrical, bodies, with, ten, segments, to, the, abdomen, generally, with, short, prolegs, on, segments, 3, 6, and, 10, the, three, pairs, of, true, legs, on, the, thorax, have, five, segments, each, many, are, well, camouflaged, others, are, aposematic, with, bright, colours, and, bristly, projections, containing, toxic, chemicals, obtained, from, their, food, plants, the, pupa, or, chrysalis, unlike, that, of, moths, is, not, wrapped, in, a, cocoon, many, butterflies, are, sexually, dimorphic, most, butterflies, have, the, zw, sex, determination, system, where, females, are, the, heterogametic, sex, zw, and, males, homogametic, zz, butterflies, are, distributed, worldwide, except, antarctica, totalling, some, 18, 500, species, of, these, 775, are, nearctic, 7, 700, neotropical, 1, 575, palearctic, 3, 650, afrotropical, and, 4, 800, are, distributed, across, the, combined, oriental, and, australian, oceania, regions, the, monarch, butterfly, is, native, to, the, americas, but, in, the, nineteenth, century, or, before, spread, across, the, world, and, is, now, found, in, australia, new, zealand, other, parts, of, oceania, and, the, iberian, peninsula, it, is, not, clear, how, it, dispersed, adults, may, have, been, blown, by, the, wind, or, larvae, or, pupae, may, have, been, accidentally, transported, by, humans, but, the, presence, of, suitable, host, plants, in, their, new, environment, was, a, necessity, for, their, successful, establishment, many, butterflies, such, as, the, painted, lady, monarch, and, several, danaine, migrate, for, long, distances, these, migrations, take, place, over, a, number, of, generations, and, no, single, individual, completes, the, whole, trip, the, eastern, north, american, population, of, monarchs, can, travel, thousands, of, miles, south, west, to, overwintering, sites, in, mexico, there, is, a, reverse, migration, in, the, spring, it, has, recently, been, shown, that, the, british, painted, lady, undertakes, a, 9, 000, mile, round, trip, in, a, series, of, steps, by, up, to, six, successive, generations, from, tropical, africa, to, the, arctic, circle, almost, double, the, length, of, the, famous, migrations, undertaken, by, monarch, spectacular, large, scale, migrations, associated, with, the, monsoon, are, seen, in, peninsular, india, migrations, have, been, studied, in, more, recent, times, using, wing, tags, and, also, using, stable, hydrogen, isotopes, butterflies, navigate, using, a, time, compensated, sun, compass, they, can, see, polarized, light, and, therefore, orient, even, in, cloudy, conditions, the, polarized, light, near, the, ultraviolet, spectrum, appears, to, be, particularly, important, many, migratory, butterflies, live, in, semi, arid, areas, where, breeding, seasons, are, short, the, life, histories, of, their, host, plants, also, influence, butterfly, behaviour, butterflies, in, their, adult, stage, can, live, from, a, week, to, nearly, a, year, depending, on, the, species, many, species, have, long, larval, life, stages, while, others, can, remain, dormant, in, their, pupal, or, egg, stages, and, thereby, survive, winters, the, melissa, arctic, oeneis, melissa, overwinters, twice, as, a, caterpillar, butterflies, may, have, one, or, more, broods, per, year, the, number, of, generations, per, year, varies, from, temperate, to, tropical, regions, with, tropical, regions, showing, a, trend, towards, multivoltinism, courtship, is, often, aerial, and, often, involves, pheromones, butterflies, then, land, on, the, ground, or, on, a, perch, to, mate, copulation, takes, place, tail, to, tail, and, may, last, from, minutes, to, hours, simple, photoreceptor, cells, located, at, the, genitals, are, important, for, this, and, other, adult, behaviours, the, male, passes, a, spermatophore, to, the, female, to, reduce, sperm, competition, he, may, cover, her, with, his, scent, or, in, some, species, such, as, the, apollos, parnassius, plugs, her, genital, opening, to, prevent, her, from, mating, again, the, vast, majority, of, butterflies, have, a, four, stage, life, cycle, egg, larva, caterpillar, pupa, chrysalis, and, imago, adult, in, the, genera, colias, erebia, euchloe, and, parnassius, a, small, number, of, species, are, known, that, reproduce, semi, parthenogenetically, when, the, female, dies, a, partially, developed, larva, emerges, from, her, abdomen, butterfly, eggs, are, protected, by, a, hard, ridged, outer, layer, of, shell, called, the, chorion, this, is, lined, with, a, thin, coating, of, wax, which, prevents, the, egg, from, drying, out, before, the, larva, has, had, time, to, fully, develop, each, egg, contains, a, number, of, tiny, funnel, shaped, openings, at, one, end, called, micropyles, the, purpose, of, these, holes, is, to, allow, sperm, to, enter, and, fertilize, the, egg, butterfly, eggs, vary, greatly, in, size, and, shape, between, species, but, are, usually, upright, and, finely, sculptured, some, species, lay, eggs, singly, others, in, batches, many, females, produce, between, one, hundred, and, two, hundred, eggs, butterfly, eggs, are, fixed, to, a, leaf, with, a, special, glue, which, hardens, rapidly, as, it, hardens, it, contracts, deforming, the, shape, of, the, egg, this, glue, is, easily, seen, surrounding, the, base, of, every, egg, forming, a, meniscus, the, nature, of, the, glue, has, been, little, researched, but, in, the, case, of, pieris, brassicae, it, begins, as, a, pale, yellow, granular, secretion, containing, acidophilic, proteins, this, is, viscous, and, darkens, when, exposed, to, air, becoming, a, water, insoluble, rubbery, material, which, soon, sets, solid, butterflies, in, the, genus, agathymus, do, not, fix, their, eggs, to, a, leaf, instead, the, newly, laid, eggs, fall, to, the, base, of, the, plant, eggs, are, almost, invariably, laid, on, plants, each, species, of, butterfly, has, its, own, host, plant, range, and, while, some, species, of, butterfly, are, restricted, to, just, one, species, of, plant, others, use, a, range, of, plant, species, often, including, members, of, a, common, family, in, some, species, such, as, the, great, spangled, fritillary, the, eggs, are, deposited, close, to, but, not, on, the, food, plant, this, most, likely, happens, when, the, egg, overwinters, before, hatching, and, where, the, host, plant, loses, its, leaves, in, winter, as, do, violets, in, this, example, the, egg, stage, lasts, a, few, weeks, in, most, butterflies, but, eggs, laid, close, to, winter, especially, in, temperate, regions, go, through, a, diapause, resting, stage, and, the, hatching, may, take, place, only, in, spring, some, temperate, region, butterflies, such, as, the, camberwell, beauty, lay, their, eggs, in, the, spring, and, have, them, hatch, in, the, summer, butterfly, larvae, or, caterpillars, consume, plant, leaves, and, spend, practically, all, of, their, time, searching, for, and, eating, food, although, most, caterpillars, are, herbivorous, a, few, species, are, predators, spalgis, epius, eats, scale, insects, while, lycaenids, such, as, liphyra, brassolis, are, myrmecophilous, eating, ant, larvae, some, larvae, especially, those, of, the, lycaenidae, form, mutual, associations, with, ants, they, communicate, with, the, ants, using, vibrations, that, are, transmitted, through, the, substrate, as, well, as, using, chemical, signals, the, ants, provide, some, degree, of, protection, to, these, larvae, and, they, in, turn, gather, honeydew, secretions, large, blue, phengaris, arion, caterpillars, trick, myrmica, ants, into, taking, them, back, to, the, ant, colony, where, they, feed, on, the, ant, eggs, and, larvae, in, a, parasitic, relationship, caterpillars, mature, through, a, series, of, developmental, stages, known, as, instars, near, the, end, of, each, stage, the, larva, undergoes, a, process, called, apolysis, mediated, by, the, release, of, a, series, of, neurohormones, during, this, phase, the, cuticle, a, tough, outer, layer, made, of, a, mixture, of, chitin, and, specialized, proteins, is, released, from, the, softer, epidermis, beneath, and, the, epidermis, begins, to, form, a, new, cuticle, at, the, end, of, each, instar, the, larva, moults, the, old, cuticle, splits, and, the, new, cuticle, expands, rapidly, hardening, and, developing, pigment, development, of, butterfly, wing, patterns, begins, by, the, last, larval, instar, caterpillars, have, short, antennae, and, several, simple, eyes, the, mouthparts, are, adapted, for, chewing, with, powerful, mandibles, and, a, pair, of, maxillae, each, with, a, segmented, palp, adjoining, these, is, the, labium, hypopharynx, which, houses, a, tubular, spinneret, which, is, able, to, extrude, silk, caterpillars, such, as, those, in, the, genus, calpodes, family, hesperiidae, have, a, specialized, tracheal, system, on, the, 8th, segment, that, function, as, a, primitive, lung, butterfly, caterpillars, have, three, pairs, of, true, legs, on, the, thoracic, segments, and, up, to, six, pairs, of, prolegs, arising, from, the, abdominal, segments, these, prolegs, have, rings, of, tiny, hooks, called, crochets, that, are, engaged, hydrostatically, and, help, the, caterpillar, grip, the, substrate, the, epidermis, bears, tufts, of, setae, the, position, and, number, of, which, help, in, identifying, the, species, there, is, also, decoration, in, the, form, of, hairs, wart, like, protuberances, horn, like, protuberances, and, spines, internally, most, of, the, body, cavity, is, taken, up, by, the, gut, but, there, may, also, be, large, silk, glands, and, special, glands, which, secrete, distasteful, or, toxic, substances, the, developing, wings, are, present, in, later, stage, instars, and, the, gonads, start, development, in, the, egg, stage, when, the, larva, is, fully, grown, hormones, such, as, prothoracicotropic, hormone, ptth, are, produced, at, this, point, the, larva, stops, feeding, and, begins, wandering, in, the, quest, for, a, suitable, pupation, site, often, the, underside, of, a, leaf, or, other, concealed, location, there, it, spins, a, button, of, silk, which, it, uses, to, fasten, its, body, to, the, surface, and, moults, for, a, final, time, while, some, caterpillars, spin, a, cocoon, to, protect, the, pupa, most, species, do, not, the, naked, pupa, often, known, as, a, chrysalis, usually, hangs, head, down, from, the, cremaster, a, spiny, pad, at, the, posterior, end, but, in, some, species, a, silken, girdle, may, be, spun, to, keep, the, pupa, in, a, head, up, position, most, of, the, tissues, and, cells, of, the, larva, are, broken, down, inside, the, pupa, as, the, constituent, material, is, rebuilt, into, the, imago, the, structure, of, the, transforming, insect, is, visible, from, the, exterior, with, the, wings, folded, flat, on, the, ventral, surface, and, the, two, halves, of, the, proboscis, with, the, antennae, and, the, legs, between, them, the, pupal, transformation, into, a, butterfly, through, metamorphosis, has, held, great, appeal, to, mankind, to, transform, from, the, miniature, wings, visible, on, the, outside, of, the, pupa, into, large, structures, usable, for, flight, the, pupal, wings, undergo, rapid, mitosis, and, absorb, a, great, deal, of, nutrients, if, one, wing, is, surgically, removed, early, on, the, other, three, will, grow, to, a, larger, size, in, the, pupa, the, wing, forms, a, structure, that, becomes, compressed, from, top, to, bottom, and, pleated, from, proximal, to, distal, ends, as, it, grows, so, that, it, can, rapidly, be, unfolded, to, its, full, adult, size, several, boundaries, seen, in, the, adult, colour, pattern, are, marked, by, changes, in, the, expression, of, particular, transcription, factors, in, the, early, pupa, the, reproductive, stage, of, the, insect, is, the, winged, adult, or, imago, the, surface, of, both, butterflies, and, moths, is, covered, by, scales, each, of, which, is, an, outgrowth, from, a, single, epidermal, cell, the, head, is, small, and, dominated, by, the, two, large, compound, eyes, these, are, capable, of, distinguishing, flower, shapes, or, motion, but, cannot, view, distant, objects, clearly, colour, perception, is, good, especially, in, some, species, in, the, blue, violet, range, the, antennae, are, composed, of, many, segments, and, have, clubbed, tips, unlike, moths, that, have, tapering, or, feathery, antennae, the, sensory, receptors, are, concentrated, in, the, tips, and, can, detect, odours, taste, receptors, are, located, on, the, palps, and, on, the, feet, the, mouthparts, are, adapted, to, sucking, and, the, mandibles, are, usually, reduced, in, size, or, absent, the, first, maxillae, are, elongated, into, a, tubular, proboscis, which, is, curled, up, at, rest, and, expanded, when, needed, to, feed, the, first, and, second, maxillae, bear, palps, which, function, as, sensory, organs, some, species, have, a, reduced, proboscis, or, maxillary, palps, and, do, not, feed, as, adults, many, heliconius, butterflies, also, use, their, proboscis, to, feed, on, pollen, in, these, species, only, 20, of, the, amino, acids, used, in, reproduction, come, from, larval, feeding, which, allow, them, to, develop, more, quickly, as, caterpillars, and, gives, them, a, longer, lifespan, of, several, months, as, adults, the, thorax, of, the, butterfly, is, devoted, to, locomotion, each, of, the, three, thoracic, segments, has, two, legs, among, nymphalids, the, first, pair, is, reduced, and, the, insects, walk, on, four, legs, the, second, and, third, segments, of, the, thorax, bear, the, wings, the, leading, edges, of, the, forewings, have, thick, veins, to, strengthen, them, and, the, hindwings, are, smaller, and, more, rounded, and, have, fewer, stiffening, veins, the, forewings, and, hindwings, are, not, hooked, together, as, they, are, in, moths, but, are, coordinated, by, the, friction, of, their, overlapping, parts, the, front, two, segments, have, a, pair, of, spiracles, which, are, used, in, respiration, the, abdomen, consists, of, ten, segments, and, contains, the, gut, and, genital, organs, the, front, eight, segments, have, spiracles, and, the, terminal, segment, is, modified, for, reproduction, the, male, has, a, pair, of, clasping, organs, attached, to, a, ring, structure, and, during, copulation, a, tubular, structure, is, extruded, and, inserted, into, the, female, s, vagina, a, spermatophore, is, deposited, in, the, female, following, which, the, sperm, make, their, way, to, a, seminal, receptacle, where, they, are, stored, for, later, use, in, both, sexes, the, genitalia, are, adorned, with, various, spines, teeth, scales, and, bristles, which, act, to, prevent, the, butterfly, from, mating, with, an, insect, of, another, species, after, it, emerges, from, its, pupal, stage, a, butterfly, cannot, fly, until, the, wings, are, unfolded, a, newly, emerged, butterfly, needs, to, spend, some, time, inflating, its, wings, with, hemolymph, and, letting, them, dry, during, which, time, it, is, extremely, vulnerable, to, predators, the, colourful, patterns, on, many, butterfly, wings, tell, potential, predators, that, they, are, toxic, hence, the, genetic, basis, of, wing, pattern, formation, can, illuminate, both, the, evolution, of, butterflies, as, well, as, their, developmental, biology, the, colour, of, butterfly, wings, is, derived, from, tiny, structures, called, scales, each, of, which, have, their, own, pigments, in, heliconius, butterflies, there, are, three, types, of, scales, yellow, white, black, and, red, orange, brown, scales, some, mechanism, of, wing, pattern, formation, are, now, being, solved, using, genetic, techniques, for, instance, a, gene, called, cortex, determines, the, colour, of, scales, deleting, cortex, turned, black, and, red, scales, yellow, mutations, e, g, transposon, insertions, of, the, non, coding, dna, around, the, cortex, gene, can, turn, a, black, winged, butterfly, into, a, butterfly, with, a, yellow, wing, band, when, the, butterfly, bicyclus, anynana, is, subjected, to, repeated, inbreeding, in, the, laboratory, there, is, a, dramatic, decrease, in, egg, hatching, this, severe, inbreeding, depression, is, considered, to, be, likely, due, to, a, relatively, high, mutation, rate, to, recessive, alleles, with, substantial, damaging, effects, and, infrequent, episodes, of, inbreeding, in, nature, that, might, otherwise, purge, such, mutations, although, b, anynana, experiences, inbreeding, depression, when, forcibly, inbred, in, the, laboratory, it, recovers, within, a, few, generation, when, allowed, to, breed, freely, during, mate, selection, adult, females, do, not, innately, avoid, or, learn, to, avoid, siblings, implying, that, such, detection, may, not, be, critical, to, reproductive, fitness, inbreeding, may, persist, in, b, anynana, because, the, probability, of, encountering, close, relatives, is, rare, in, nature, that, is, movement, ecology, may, mask, the, deleterious, effect, of, inbreeding, resulting, in, relaxation, of, selection, for, active, inbreeding, avoidance, behaviors, butterflies, feed, primarily, on, nectar, from, flowers, some, also, derive, nourishment, from, pollen, tree, sap, rotting, fruit, dung, decaying, flesh, and, dissolved, minerals, in, wet, sand, or, dirt, butterflies, are, important, as, pollinators, for, some, species, of, plants, in, general, they, do, not, carry, as, much, pollen, load, as, bees, but, they, are, capable, of, moving, pollen, over, greater, distances, flower, constancy, has, been, observed, for, at, least, one, species, of, butterfly, adult, butterflies, consume, only, liquids, ingested, through, the, proboscis, they, sip, water, from, damp, patches, for, hydration, and, feed, on, nectar, from, flowers, from, which, they, obtain, sugars, for, energy, and, sodium, and, other, minerals, vital, for, reproduction, several, species, of, butterflies, need, more, sodium, than, that, provided, by, nectar, and, are, attracted, by, sodium, in, salt, they, sometimes, land, on, people, attracted, by, the, salt, in, human, sweat, some, butterflies, also, visit, dung, and, scavenge, rotting, fruit, or, carcasses, to, obtain, minerals, and, nutrients, in, many, species, this, mud, puddling, behaviour, is, restricted, to, the, males, and, studies, have, suggested, that, the, nutrients, collected, may, be, provided, as, a, nuptial, gift, along, with, the, spermatophore, during, mating, in, hilltopping, males, of, some, species, seek, hilltops, and, ridge, tops, which, they, patrol, in, search, for, females, since, it, usually, occurs, in, species, with, low, population, density, it, is, assumed, these, landscape, points, are, used, as, meeting, places, to, find, mates, butterflies, use, their, antennae, to, sense, the, air, for, wind, and, scents, the, antennae, come, in, various, shapes, and, colours, the, hesperiids, have, a, pointed, angle, or, hook, to, the, antennae, while, most, other, families, show, knobbed, antennae, the, antennae, are, richly, covered, with, sensory, organs, known, as, sensillae, a, butterfly, s, sense, of, taste, is, coordinated, by, chemoreceptors, on, the, tarsi, or, feet, which, work, only, on, contact, and, are, used, to, determine, whether, an, egg, laying, insect, s, offspring, will, be, able, to, feed, on, a, leaf, before, eggs, are, laid, on, it, many, butterflies, use, chemical, signals, pheromones, some, have, specialized, scent, scales, androconia, or, other, structures, coremata, or, hair, pencils, in, the, danaidae, vision, is, well, developed, in, butterflies, and, most, species, are, sensitive, to, the, ultraviolet, spectrum, many, species, show, sexual, dimorphism, in, the, patterns, of, uv, reflective, patches, colour, vision, may, be, widespread, but, has, been, demonstrated, in, only, a, few, species, some, butterflies, have, organs, of, hearing, and, some, species, make, stridulatory, and, clicking, sounds, many, species, of, butterfly, maintain, territories, and, actively, chase, other, species, or, individuals, that, may, stray, into, them, some, species, will, bask, or, perch, on, chosen, perches, the, flight, styles, of, butterflies, are, often, characteristic, and, some, species, have, courtship, flight, displays, butterflies, can, only, fly, when, their, temperature, is, above, 27, c, 81, f, when, it, is, cool, they, can, position, themselves, to, expose, the, underside, of, the, wings, to, the, sunlight, to, heat, themselves, up, if, their, body, temperature, reaches, 40, c, 104, f, they, can, orientate, themselves, with, the, folded, wings, edgewise, to, the, sun, basking, is, an, activity, which, is, more, common, in, the, cooler, hours, of, the, morning, some, species, have, evolved, dark, wingbases, to, help, in, gathering, more, heat, and, this, is, especially, evident, in, alpine, forms, as, in, many, other, insects, the, lift, generated, by, butterflies, is, more, than, can, be, accounted, for, by, steady, state, non, transitory, aerodynamics, studies, using, vanessa, atalanta, in, a, wind, tunnel, show, that, they, use, a, wide, variety, of, aerodynamic, mechanisms, to, generate, force, these, include, wake, capture, vortices, at, the, wing, edge, rotational, mechanisms, and, the, weis, fogh, clap, and, fling, mechanism,

environmental, factors, braconid, and, other, parasitic, wasps, lay, their, eggs, in, lepidopteran, eggs, or, larvae, and, the, wasps, parasitoid, larvae, devour, their, hosts, usually, pupating, inside, or, outside, the, desiccated, husk, most, wasps, are, very, specific, about, their, host, species, and, some, have, been, used, as, biological, controls, of, pest, butterflies, like, the, large, white, butterfly, when, the, small, cabbage, white, was, accidentally, introduced, to, new, zealand, it, had, no, natural, enemies, in, order, to, control, it, some, pupae, that, had, been, parasitised, by, a, chalcid, wasp, were, imported, and, natural, control, was, thus, regained, some, flies, lay, their, eggs, on, the, outside, of, caterpillars, and, the, newly, hatched, fly, larvae, bore, their, way, through, the, skin, and, feed, in, a, similar, way, to, the, parasitoid, wasp, larvae, predators, of, butterflies, include, ants, spiders, wasps, and, birds, caterpillars, are, also, affected, by, a, range, of, bacterial, viral, and, fungal, diseases, and, only, a, small, percentage, of, the, butterfly, eggs, laid, ever, reach, adulthood, the, bacterium, bacillus, thuringiensis, has, been, used, in, sprays, to, reduce, damage, to, crops, by, the, caterpillars, of, the, large, white, butterfly, and, the, entomopathogenic, fungus, beauveria, bassiana, has, proved, effective, for, the, same, purpose, queen, alexandra, s, birdwing, found, in, papua, new, guinea, is, the, largest, butterfly, in, the, world, the, species, is, endangered, and, is, one, of, only, three, insects, the, other, two, being, butterflies, as, well, to, be, listed, on, appendix, i, of, cites, making, international, trade, illegal, black, grass, dart, butterfly, ocybadistes, knightorum, is, a, butterfly, of, the, family, hesperiidae, it, is, endemic, to, new, south, wales, it, has, a, very, limited, distribution, in, the, boambee, area, butterflies, protect, themselves, from, predators, by, a, variety, of, means, chemical, defences, are, widespread, and, are, mostly, based, on, chemicals, of, plant, origin, in, many, cases, the, plants, themselves, evolved, these, toxic, substances, as, protection, against, herbivores, butterflies, have, evolved, mechanisms, to, sequester, these, plant, toxins, and, use, them, instead, in, their, own, defence, these, defence, mechanisms, are, effective, only, if, they, are, well, advertised, this, has, led, to, the, evolution, of, bright, colours, in, unpalatable, butterflies, aposematism, this, signal, is, commonly, mimicked, by, other, butterflies, usually, only, females, a, batesian, mimic, imitates, another, species, to, enjoy, the, protection, of, that, species, aposematism, the, common, mormon, of, india, has, female, morphs, which, imitate, the, unpalatable, red, bodied, swallowtails, the, common, rose, and, the, crimson, rose, m, llerian, mimicry, occurs, when, aposematic, species, evolve, to, resemble, each, other, presumably, to, reduce, predator, sampling, rates, heliconius, butterflies, from, the, americas, are, a, good, example, camouflage, is, found, in, many, butterflies, some, like, the, oakleaf, butterfly, and, autumn, leaf, are, remarkable, imitations, of, leaves, as, caterpillars, many, defend, themselves, by, freezing, and, appearing, like, sticks, or, branches, others, have, deimatic, behaviours, such, as, rearing, up, and, waving, their, front, ends, which, are, marked, with, eyespots, as, if, they, were, snakes, some, papilionid, caterpillars, such, as, the, giant, swallowtail, papilio, cresphontes, resemble, bird, droppings, so, as, to, be, passed, over, by, predators, some, caterpillars, have, hairs, and, bristly, structures, that, provide, protection, while, others, are, gregarious, and, form, dense, aggregations, some, species, are, myrmecophiles, forming, mutualistic, associations, with, ants, and, gaining, their, protection, behavioural, defences, include, perching, and, angling, the, wings, to, reduce, shadow, and, avoid, being, conspicuous, some, female, nymphalid, butterflies, guard, their, eggs, from, parasitoidal, wasps, the, lycaenidae, have, a, false, head, consisting, of, eyespots, and, small, tails, false, antennae, to, deflect, attack, from, the, more, vital, head, region, these, may, also, cause, ambush, predators, such, as, spiders, to, approach, from, the, wrong, end, enabling, the, butterflies, to, detect, attacks, promptly, many, butterflies, have, eyespots, on, the, wings, these, too, may, deflect, attacks, or, may, serve, to, attract, mates, auditory, defences, can, also, be, used, which, in, the, case, of, the, grizzled, skipper, refers, to, vibrations, generated, by, the, butterfly, upon, expanding, its, wings, in, an, attempt, to, communicate, with, ant, predators, many, tropical, butterflies, have, seasonal, forms, for, dry, and, wet, seasons, these, are, switched, by, the, hormone, ecdysone, the, dry, season, forms, are, usually, more, cryptic, perhaps, offering, better, camouflage, when, vegetation, is, scarce, dark, colours, in, wet, season, forms, may, help, to, absorb, solar, radiation, butterflies, without, defences, such, as, toxins, or, mimicry, protect, themselves, through, a, flight, that, is, more, bumpy, and, unpredictable, than, in, other, species, it, is, assumed, this, behavior, makes, it, more, difficult, for, predators, to, catch, them, and, is, caused, by, the, turbulence, created, by, the, small, whirlpools, formed, by, the, wings, during, flight, declining, butterfly, populations, have, been, noticed, in, many, areas, of, the, world, and, this, phenomenon, is, consistent, with, the, rapidly, decreasing, insect, populations, around, the, world, at, least, in, the, western, united, states, this, collapse, in, the, number, of, most, species, of, butterflies, has, been, determined, to, be, driven, by, global, climate, change, specifically, by, warmer, autumns, butterflies, have, appeared, in, art, from, 3500, years, ago, in, ancient, egypt, in, hunting, scenes, butterflies, were, sometimes, included, in, a, way, that, suggested, life, freedom, and, the, strength, to, escape, capture, creating, a, balance, to, scenes, concerned, with, death, and, upholding, ma, at, they, also, were, suggestive, of, regeneration, or, rebirth, and, protection, certain, butterflies, such, as, the, tiger, butterfly, may, have, been, associated, with, solar, deities, particularly, ra, the, tiger, butterfly, also, would, have, a, particular, resemblance, to, the, ankh, due, to, its, black, body, and, wingtips, that, was, likely, noted, by, the, ancient, egyptians, butterflies, may, also, have, been, understood, as, one, of, the, deceased, s, guides, in, the, afterlife, in, the, ancient, mesoamerican, city, of, teotihuacan, the, brilliantly, coloured, image, of, the, butterfly, was, carved, into, many, temples, buildings, jewellery, and, emblazoned, on, incense, burners, the, butterfly, was, sometimes, depicted, with, the, maw, of, a, jaguar, and, some, species, were, considered, to, be, the, reincarnations, of, the, souls, of, dead, warriors, the, close, association, of, butterflies, with, fire, and, warfare, persisted, into, the, aztec, civilisation, evidence, of, similar, jaguar, butterfly, images, has, been, found, among, the, zapotec, and, maya, civilisations, butterflies, are, widely, used, in, objects, of, art, and, jewellery, mounted, in, frames, embedded, in, resin, displayed, in, bottles, laminated, in, paper, and, used, in, some, mixed, media, artworks, and, furnishings, the, norwegian, naturalist, kjell, sandved, compiled, a, photographic, butterfly, alphabet, containing, all, 26, letters, and, the, numerals, 0, to, 9, from, the, wings, of, butterflies, sir, john, tenniel, drew, a, famous, illustration, of, alice, meeting, a, caterpillar, for, lewis, carroll, s, alice, in, wonderland, c, 1865, the, caterpillar, is, seated, on, a, toadstool, and, is, smoking, a, hookah, the, image, can, be, read, as, showing, either, the, forelegs, of, the, larva, or, as, suggesting, a, face, with, protruding, nose, and, chin,
