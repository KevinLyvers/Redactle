connochaetes, gnou, black, wildebeest, connochaetes, taurinus, blue, wildebeest, wildebeest, w, l, d, b, i, s, t, wil, dib, eest, v, l, vil, also, called, gnu, n, u, noo, or, nj, u, new, are, antelopes, of, the, genus, connochaetes, and, native, to, eastern, and, southern, africa, they, belong, to, the, family, bovidae, which, includes, true, antelopes, cattle, goats, sheep, and, other, even, toed, horned, ungulates, there, are, two, species, of, wildebeest, the, black, wildebeest, or, white, tailed, gnu, c, gnou, and, the, blue, wildebeest, or, brindled, gnu, c, taurinus, fossil, records, suggest, these, two, species, diverged, about, one, million, years, ago, resulting, in, a, northern, and, a, southern, species, the, blue, wildebeest, remained, in, its, original, range, and, changed, very, little, from, the, ancestral, species, while, the, black, wildebeest, changed, more, as, adaptation, to, its, open, grassland, habitat, in, the, south, the, most, obvious, ways, of, telling, the, two, species, apart, are, the, differences, in, their, colouring, and, in, the, way, their, horns, are, oriented, in, east, africa, the, blue, wildebeest, is, the, most, abundant, big, game, species, some, populations, perform, an, annual, migration, to, new, grazing, grounds, but, the, black, wildebeest, is, merely, nomadic, breeding, in, both, takes, place, over, a, short, period, of, time, at, the, end, of, the, rainy, season, and, the, calves, are, soon, active, and, are, able, to, move, with, the, herd, a, fact, necessary, for, their, survival, nevertheless, some, fall, prey, to, large, carnivores, especially, the, spotted, hyena, wildebeest, often, graze, in, mixed, herds, with, zebra, which, gives, heightened, awareness, of, potential, predators, they, are, also, alert, to, the, warning, signals, emitted, by, other, animals, such, as, baboons, wildebeest, are, a, tourist, attraction, but, compete, with, domesticated, livestock, for, pasture, and, are, sometimes, blamed, by, farmers, for, transferring, diseases, and, parasites, to, their, cattle, illegal, hunting, does, take, place, but, the, population, trend, is, fairly, stable, wildebeest, can, also, be, found, in, national, parks, or, on, private, land, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, lists, both, kinds, of, wildebeest, as, least, concern, species, wildebeest, is, dutch, for, wild, beast, wild, ox, or, wild, cattle, in, afrikaans, bees, cattle, the, name, was, given, by, dutch, settlers, who, saw, them, on, their, way, to, the, interior, of, south, africa, in, about, 1700, because, they, resemble, wild, ox, the, blue, wildebeest, was, first, known, to, westerners, in, the, northern, part, of, south, africa, a, century, later, in, the, 1800s, some, sources, claim, the, name, gnu, originates, from, the, khoekhoe, name, for, these, animals, t, gnu, others, contend, the, name, and, its, pronunciation, in, english, go, back, to, the, word, nu, used, for, the, black, wildebeest, by, the, san, people, the, genus, name, connochaetes, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, words, k, nnos, beard, and, kha, t, flowing, hair, mane, it, is, placed, under, the, family, bovidae, and, subfamily, alcelaphinae, where, its, closest, relatives, are, the, hartebeest, alcelaphus, spp, the, hirola, beatragus, hunteri, and, species, in, the, genus, damaliscus, such, as, the, topi, the, tsessebe, the, blesbok, and, the, bontebok, the, name, connochaetes, was, given, by, german, zoologist, hinrich, lichtenstein, in, 1812, in, the, early, 20th, century, one, species, of, the, wildebeest, c, albojubatus, was, identified, in, eastern, africa, in, 1914, two, separate, races, of, the, wildebeest, were, introduced, namely, gorgon, a, albojubatus, athi, white, bearded, wildebeest, and, g, a, mearnsi, loita, white, bearded, wildebeest, however, in, 1939, the, two, were, once, again, merged, into, a, single, race, connochaetes, taurinus, albojubatus, in, the, mid, 20th, century, two, separate, forms, were, recognised, gorgon, taurinus, hecki, and, g, t, albojubatus, finally, two, distinct, types, of, wildebeest, the, blue, and, black, wildebeest, were, identified, the, blue, wildebeest, was, at, first, placed, under, a, separate, genus, gorgon, while, the, black, wildebeest, belonged, to, the, genus, connochaetes, today, they, are, united, in, the, single, genus, connochaetes, with, the, black, wildebeest, being, named, c, gnou, and, the, blue, wildebeest, c, taurinus, according, to, a, mitochondrial, dna, analysis, the, black, wildebeest, are, estimated, to, have, diverged, from, the, main, lineage, during, the, middle, pleistocene, and, became, a, distinct, species, around, a, million, years, ago, a, divergence, rate, around, 2, has, been, calculated, the, split, does, not, seem, to, have, been, driven, by, competition, for, resources, but, instead, because, each, species, adopted, a, different, ecological, niche, and, occupied, a, different, trophic, level, blue, wildebeest, fossils, dating, back, some, 2, 5, million, years, ago, are, common, and, widespread, they, have, been, found, in, the, fossil, bearing, caves, at, the, cradle, of, humankind, north, of, johannesburg, elsewhere, in, south, africa, they, are, plentiful, at, such, sites, as, elandsfontein, cornelia, and, florisbad, the, earliest, fossils, of, the, black, wildebeest, were, found, in, sedimentary, rock, in, cornelia, in, the, free, state, and, dated, back, about, 800, 000, years, today, five, subspecies, of, the, blue, wildebeest, are, recognised, while, the, black, wildebeest, has, no, named, subspecies, the, diploid, number, of, chromosomes, in, the, wildebeest, is, 58, chromosomes, were, studied, in, a, male, and, a, female, wildebeest, in, the, female, all, except, a, pair, of, very, large, submetacentric, chromosomes, were, found, to, be, acrocentric, metaphases, were, studied, in, the, male, s, chromosomes, and, very, large, submetacentric, chromosomes, were, found, there, as, well, similar, to, those, in, the, female, both, in, size, and, morphology, other, chromosomes, were, acrocentric, the, x, chromosome, is, a, large, acrocentric, and, the, y, chromosome, a, minute, one, the, two, species, of, the, wildebeest, are, known, to, hybridise, male, black, wildebeest, have, been, reported, to, mate, with, female, blue, wildebeest, and, vice, versa, the, differences, in, social, behaviour, and, habitats, have, historically, prevented, interspecific, hybridisation, between, the, species, but, hybridisation, may, occur, when, they, are, both, confined, within, the, same, area, the, resulting, offspring, are, usually, fertile, a, study, of, these, hybrid, animals, at, spioenkop, dam, nature, reserve, in, south, africa, revealed, that, many, had, disadvantageous, abnormalities, relating, to, their, teeth, horns, and, the, wormian, bones, in, the, skull, another, study, reported, an, increase, in, the, size, of, the, hybrid, as, compared, to, either, of, its, parents, in, some, animals, the, tympanic, part, of, the, temporal, bone, is, highly, deformed, and, in, others, the, radius, and, ulna, are, fused, both, species, of, wildebeest, are, even, toed, horned, greyish, brown, ungulates, resembling, cattle, males, are, larger, than, females, and, both, have, heavy, forequarters, compared, to, their, hindquarters, they, have, broad, muzzles, roman, noses, and, shaggy, manes, and, tails, the, most, striking, morphological, differences, between, the, black, and, blue, wildebeest, are, the, orientation, and, curvature, of, their, horns, and, the, colour, of, their, coats, the, blue, wildebeest, is, the, bigger, of, the, two, species, in, males, blue, wildebeest, stand, 150, cm, 59, in, tall, at, the, shoulder, and, weigh, around, 250, kg, 550, lb, while, the, black, wildebeest, stands, 111, 120, cm, 44, 47, in, tall, and, weighs, about, 180, kg, 400, lb, in, females, blue, wildebeest, have, a, shoulder, height, of, 135, cm, 53, in, and, weigh, 180, kg, 400, lb, while, black, wildebeest, females, stand, 108, cm, 43, in, at, the, shoulder, and, weigh, 155, kg, 342, lb, the, horns, of, blue, wildebeest, protrude, to, the, side, then, curve, downwards, before, curving, up, back, towards, the, skull, while, the, horns, of, the, black, wildebeest, curve, forward, then, downward, before, curving, upwards, at, the, tips, blue, wildebeest, tend, to, be, a, dark, grey, colour, with, stripes, but, may, have, a, bluish, sheen, the, black, wildebeest, has, brown, coloured, hair, with, a, mane, that, ranges, in, colour, from, cream, to, black, and, a, cream, coloured, tail, the, blue, wildebeest, lives, in, a, wide, variety, of, habitats, including, woodlands, and, grasslands, while, the, black, wildebeest, tends, to, reside, exclusively, in, open, grassland, areas, in, some, areas, the, blue, wildebeest, migrates, over, long, distances, in, the, winter, whereas, the, black, wildebeest, does, not, the, milk, of, the, black, wildebeest, contains, a, higher, protein, lower, fat, and, lower, lactose, content, than, the, milk, of, the, blue, wildebeest, wildebeest, can, live, more, than, 40, years, though, their, average, lifespan, is, around, 20, years, wildebeest, inhabit, the, plains, and, open, woodlands, of, parts, of, africa, south, of, the, sahara, the, black, wildebeest, is, native, to, the, southernmost, parts, of, the, continent, its, historical, range, included, south, africa, eswatini, and, lesotho, but, in, the, latter, two, countries, it, was, hunted, to, extinction, in, the, 19th, century, it, has, now, been, reintroduced, to, them, and, also, introduced, to, namibia, where, it, has, become, well, established, it, inhabits, open, plains, grasslands, and, karoo, shrublands, in, both, steep, mountainous, regions, and, lower, undulating, hills, at, altitudes, varying, between, 1, 350, and, 2, 150, m, 4, 430, and, 7, 050, ft, in, the, past, it, inhabited, the, highveld, temperate, grasslands, during, the, dry, winter, season, and, the, arid, karoo, region, during, the, rains, however, as, a, result, of, widespread, hunting, the, black, wildebeest, no, longer, occupies, its, historical, range, or, makes, migrations, and, is, now, largely, limited, to, game, farms, and, protected, reserves, the, blue, wildebeest, is, native, to, eastern, and, southern, africa, its, range, includes, kenya, tanzania, botswana, zambia, zimbabwe, mozambique, south, africa, eswatini, and, angola, it, is, no, longer, found, in, malawi, but, has, been, successfully, reintroduced, into, namibia, blue, wildebeest, are, mainly, found, in, short, grass, plains, bordering, bush, covered, acacia, savannas, thriving, in, areas, that, are, neither, too, wet, nor, too, dry, they, can, be, found, in, habitats, that, vary, from, overgrazed, areas, with, dense, bush, to, open, woodland, floodplains, in, east, africa, the, blue, wildebeest, is, the, most, abundant, big, game, species, both, in, population, and, biomass, it, is, a, notable, feature, of, the, serengeti, national, park, in, tanzania, the, maasai, mara, national, reserve, in, kenya, and, the, liuwa, plain, national, park, in, zambia, not, all, wildebeest, are, migratory, black, wildebeest, herds, are, often, nomadic, or, may, have, a, regular, home, range, of, 1, km, 2, 0, 39, sq, mi, bulls, may, occupy, territories, usually, about, 100, to, 400, m, 300, to, 1, 300, ft, apart, but, this, spacing, varies, according, to, the, quality, of, the, habitat, in, favourable, conditions, they, may, be, as, close, as, 9, m, 30, ft, or, they, may, be, as, far, apart, as, 1, 600, m, 5, 200, ft, in, poor, habitat, female, herds, have, home, ranges, of, about, 250, acres, 100, ha, 0, 39, sq, mi, in, size, herds, of, nonterritorial, bachelor, males, roam, at, will, and, do, not, seem, to, have, any, restrictions, on, where, they, wander, blue, wildebeest, have, both, migratory, and, sedentary, populations, in, the, ngorongoro, most, animals, are, sedentary, and, males, maintain, a, network, of, territories, throughout, the, year, though, breeding, is, seasonal, in, nature, females, and, young, form, groups, of, about, 10, individuals, or, join, in, larger, aggregations, and, nonterritorial, males, form, bachelor, groups, in, the, serengeti, and, tarangire, ecosystems, populations, are, mostly, migratory, with, herds, consisting, of, both, sexes, frequently, moving, but, resident, subpopulations, also, exist, during, the, rutting, season, the, males, may, form, temporary, territories, for, a, few, hours, or, a, day, or, so, and, attempt, to, gather, together, a, few, females, with, which, to, mate, but, soon, they, have, to, move, on, often, moving, ahead, to, set, up, another, temporary, territory, in, the, maasai, mara, game, reserve, a, non, migratory, population, of, blue, wildebeest, had, dwindled, from, about, 119, 000, animals, in, 1977, to, about, 22, 000, in, 1997, the, reason, for, the, decline, is, thought, to, be, the, increasing, competition, between, cattle, and, wildebeest, for, a, diminishing, area, of, grazing, land, as, a, result, of, changes, in, agricultural, practices, and, possibly, fluctuations, in, rainfall, each, year, some, east, african, populations, of, blue, wildebeest, have, a, long, distance, migration, seemingly, timed, to, coincide, with, the, annual, pattern, of, rainfall, and, grass, growth, the, timing, of, their, migrations, in, both, the, rainy, and, dry, seasons, can, vary, considerably, by, months, from, year, to, year, at, the, end, of, the, wet, season, may, or, june, in, east, africa, wildebeest, migrate, to, dry, season, areas, in, response, to, a, lack, of, surface, drinking, water, when, the, rainy, season, begins, again, months, later, animals, quickly, move, back, to, their, wet, season, ranges, factors, suspected, to, affect, migration, include, food, abundance, surface, water, availability, predators, and, phosphorus, content, in, grasses, phosphorus, is, a, crucial, element, for, all, life, forms, particularly, for, lactating, female, bovids, as, a, result, during, the, rainy, season, wildebeest, select, grazing, areas, that, contain, particularly, high, phosphorus, levels, one, study, found, in, addition, to, phosphorus, wildebeest, select, ranges, containing, grass, with, relatively, high, nitrogen, content, aerial, photography, has, revealed, that, a, level, of, organisation, occurs, in, the, movement, of, the, herd, that, cannot, be, apparent, to, each, individual, animal, for, example, the, migratory, herd, exhibits, a, wavy, front, and, this, suggests, that, some, degree, of, local, decision, making, is, taking, place, numerous, documentaries, feature, wildebeest, crossing, rivers, with, many, being, eaten, by, crocodiles, or, drowning, in, the, attempt, while, having, the, appearance, of, a, frenzy, recent, research, has, shown, a, herd, of, wildebeest, possesses, what, is, known, as, a, swarm, intelligence, whereby, the, animals, systematically, explore, and, overcome, the, obstacle, as, one, the, wildebeest, only, has, interdigital, hoof, glands, in, its, fore, legs, analysis, of, chemical, constituents, from, a, free, ranging, blue, wildebeest, from, zimbabwe, cawston, block, showed, this, gland, contains, cyclohexanecarboxylic, acid, phenol, 2, phenolethanol, and, six, short, chain, carboxylic, acids, major, predators, that, feed, on, wildebeest, include, the, lion, hyena, african, wild, dog, cheetah, leopard, and, nile, crocodile, which, seem, to, favour, the, wildebeest, over, other, prey, wildebeest, however, are, very, strong, and, can, inflict, considerable, injury, even, to, a, lion, wildebeest, have, a, maximum, running, speed, of, around, 80, km, h, 50, mph, the, primary, defensive, tactic, is, herding, where, the, young, animals, are, protected, by, the, older, larger, ones, while, the, herd, runs, as, a, group, typically, the, predators, attempt, to, isolate, a, young, or, ill, animal, and, attack, without, having, to, worry, about, the, herd, wildebeest, have, developed, additional, sophisticated, cooperative, behaviours, such, as, animals, taking, turns, sleeping, while, others, stand, guard, against, a, night, attack, by, invading, predators, wildebeest, migrations, are, closely, followed, by, vultures, as, wildebeest, carcasses, are, an, important, source, of, food, for, these, scavengers, the, vultures, consume, about, 70, of, the, wildebeest, carcasses, available, decreases, in, the, number, of, migrating, wildebeest, have, also, had, a, negative, effect, on, the, vultures, in, the, serengeti, ecosystem, tanzania, wildebeest, may, help, facilitate, the, migration, of, other, smaller, bodied, grazers, such, as, thomson, s, gazelles, eudorcas, thomsonii, which, eat, the, new, growth, grasses, stimulated, by, wildebeest, foraging, zebras, and, wildebeest, group, together, in, open, savannah, environments, with, high, chances, of, predation, this, grouping, strategy, reduces, predation, risk, because, larger, groups, decrease, each, individual, s, chance, of, being, hunted, and, predators, are, more, easily, seen, in, open, areas, the, seasonal, presence, of, thousands, of, migratory, wildebeests, reduces, local, lion, predation, on, giraffe, calves, resulting, in, greater, survival, of, giraffes, wildebeest, can, also, listen, in, on, the, alarm, calls, of, other, species, and, by, doing, so, can, reduce, their, risk, of, predation, one, study, showed, along, with, other, ungulates, wildebeests, responded, more, strongly, to, the, baboon, alarm, calls, compared, to, the, baboon, contest, calls, though, both, types, of, calls, had, similar, patterns, amplitudes, and, durations, the, alarm, calls, were, a, response, of, the, baboons, to, lions, and, the, contest, calls, were, recorded, when, a, dispute, between, two, males, occurred, wildebeest, compete, with, domesticated, livestock, for, pasture, and, are, sometimes, blamed, by, farmers, for, transferring, diseases, and, parasites, to, their, cattle, wildebeest, do, not, form, permanent, pair, bonds, and, during, the, mating, season, or, rut, the, males, establish, temporary, territories, and, try, to, attract, females, into, them, these, small, territories, are, about, 3, 000, square, metres, 32, 000, sq, ft, 0, 74, acres, with, up, to, 300, territories, per, 1, square, kilometre, 0, 39, sq, mi, 250, acres, the, males, defend, these, territories, from, other, males, while, competing, for, females, that, are, coming, into, oestrus, the, males, use, grunts, and, distinctive, behaviour, to, entice, females, into, their, territories, wildebeest, usually, breed, at, the, end, of, the, rainy, season, when, the, animals, are, well, fed, and, at, their, peak, of, fitness, this, usually, occurs, between, may, and, july, and, birthing, usually, takes, place, between, january, and, march, at, the, start, of, the, wet, season, wildebeest, females, breed, seasonally, and, ovulate, spontaneously, the, estrous, cycle, is, about, 23, days, and, the, gestation, period, lasts, 250, to, 260, days, the, calves, weigh, about, 21, kg, 46, lb, at, birth, and, scramble, to, their, feet, within, minutes, being, able, to, move, with, the, herd, soon, afterwards, a, fact, on, which, their, survival, relies, the, main, predator, of, the, calves, is, the, spotted, hyena, the, calving, peak, period, lasts, for, 2, 3, weeks, and, in, small, subpopulations, and, isolated, groups, mortality, of, calves, may, be, as, high, as, 50, however, in, larger, aggregations, or, small, groups, living, near, large, herds, mortality, rates, may, be, under, 20, groups, of, wildebeest, females, and, young, live, in, the, small, areas, established, by, the, male, when, groups, of, wildebeest, join, the, female, to, male, ratio, is, higher, because, the, females, choose, to, move, to, the, areas, held, by, a, smaller, number, of, males, this, female, dominated, sex, ratio, may, be, due, to, illegal, hunting, and, human, disturbance, with, higher, male, mortality, having, been, attributed, to, hunting, the, black, wildebeest, has, been, classified, as, a, least, concern, species, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, in, the, iucn, red, list, the, populations, of, this, species, are, on, an, increase, now, more, than, 18, 000, individuals, are, believed, to, remain, 7, 000, of, which, are, in, namibia, outside, their, natural, range, and, where, it, is, farmed, around, 80, of, the, wildebeest, occurs, in, private, areas, while, the, other, 20, is, confined, in, protected, areas, its, introduction, into, namibia, has, been, a, success, and, numbers, have, increased, substantially, there, from, 150, in, 1982, to, 7, 000, in, 1992, the, blue, wildebeest, has, also, been, rated, as, of, least, concern, the, population, trend, is, stable, and, their, numbers, are, estimated, to, be, around, 1, 500, 000, mainly, due, to, the, increase, of, the, populations, in, serengeti, national, park, tanzania, to, 1, 300, 000, as, of, 1998, however, the, numbers, of, one, of, the, subspecies, the, eastern, white, bearded, wildebeest, c, t, albojubatus, have, seen, a, steep, decline, population, density, ranges, from, 0, 15, km, 2, in, hwange, and, etosha, national, parks, to, 35, km, 2, in, ngorongoro, conservation, area, and, serengeti, national, park, overland, migration, as, a, biological, process, requires, large, connected, landscapes, which, are, increasingly, difficult, to, maintain, particularly, over, the, long, term, when, human, demands, on, the, landscape, compete, the, most, acute, threat, comes, from, migration, barriers, such, as, fences, and, roads, in, one, of, the, more, striking, examples, of, the, consequences, of, fence, building, on, terrestrial, migrations, botswanan, authorities, placed, thousands, of, kilometres, of, fences, across, the, kalahari, that, prevented, wildebeests, from, reaching, watering, holes, and, grazing, grounds, resulting, in, the, deaths, of, tens, of, thousands, of, individuals, reducing, the, wildebeest, population, to, less, than, 10, of, its, previous, size, illegal, hunting, is, a, major, conservation, concern, in, many, areas, along, with, natural, threats, posed, by, main, predators, which, include, lions, leopards, african, hunting, dogs, cheetahs, and, hyenas, where, the, black, and, blue, wildebeest, share, a, common, range, the, two, can, hybridise, and, this, is, regarded, as, a, potential, threat, to, the, black, wildebeest, wildebeest, provide, several, useful, animal, products, the, hide, makes, good, quality, leather, and, the, flesh, is, coarse, dry, and, rather, hard, wildebeest, are, killed, for, food, especially, to, make, biltong, in, southern, africa, this, dried, game, meat, is, a, delicacy, and, an, important, food, item, in, africa, the, meat, of, females, is, more, tender, than, that, of, males, and, is, the, most, tender, during, the, autumn, season, wildebeest, are, a, regular, target, for, illegal, meat, hunters, because, their, numbers, make, them, easy, to, find, cooks, preparing, the, wildebeest, carcass, usually, cut, it, into, 11, pieces, the, estimated, price, for, wildebeest, meat, was, about, us, 0, 47, per, 1, kilogram, 2, 2, lb, around, 2008, the, silky, flowing, tail, of, the, black, wildebeest, is, used, to, make, fly, whisks, or, chowries, wildebeest, benefit, the, ecosystem, by, increasing, soil, fertility, with, their, excreta, they, are, economically, important, for, human, beings, as, they, are, a, major, tourist, attraction, they, also, provide, important, products, such, as, leather, to, humans, wildebeest, however, can, also, have, a, negative, impact, on, humans, wild, individuals, can, be, competitors, of, commercial, livestock, and, can, transmit, diseases, and, cause, epidemics, among, animals, particularly, domestic, cattle, they, can, also, spread, ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies, and, paramphistome, flukes, the, wildebeest, is, depicted, on, the, coat, of, arms, of, the, province, of, natal, and, later, kwazulu, natal, in, south, africa, over, the, years, the, south, african, authorities, have, issued, several, stamps, displaying, the, animal, and, the, south, african, mint, has, struck, a, two, cent, piece, with, a,
