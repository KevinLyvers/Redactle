sturgeon, from, old, english, styr, a, ultimately, from, proto, indo, european, str, hx, y, n, is, the, common, name, for, the, 28, species, of, fish, belonging, to, the, family, acipenseridae, the, earliest, sturgeon, fossils, date, to, the, late, cretaceous, and, are, descended, from, other, earlier, acipenseriform, fish, which, date, back, to, the, early, jurassic, period, some, 174, to, 201, million, years, ago, they, are, one, of, two, living, families, of, the, acipenseriformes, alongside, paddlefish, polyodontidae, the, family, is, grouped, into, four, genera, acipenser, which, is, paraphyletic, containing, many, distantly, related, sturgeon, species, huso, scaphirhynchus, and, pseudoscaphirhynchus, two, species, a, naccarii, and, a, dabryanus, may, be, extinct, in, the, wild, and, one, p, fedtschenkoi, may, be, entirely, extinct, sturgeons, are, native, to, subtropical, temperate, and, sub, arctic, rivers, lakes, and, coastlines, of, eurasia, and, north, america, a, maastrichtian, age, fossil, found, in, morocco, shows, that, they, also, once, lived, in, africa, sturgeons, are, long, lived, late, maturing, fishes, with, distinctive, characteristics, such, as, a, heterocercal, caudal, fin, similar, to, those, of, sharks, and, an, elongated, spindle, like, body, that, is, smooth, skinned, scaleless, and, armored, with, five, lateral, rows, of, bony, plates, called, scutes, several, species, can, grow, quite, large, typically, ranging, 2, 3, 5, m, 7, 12, ft, in, length, the, largest, sturgeon, on, record, was, a, beluga, female, captured, in, the, volga, delta, in, 1827, measuring, 7, 2, m, 23, ft, 7, in, long, and, weighing, 1, 571, kg, 3, 463, lb, most, sturgeons, are, anadromous, bottom, feeders, migrating, upstream, to, spawn, but, spending, most, of, their, lives, feeding, in, river, deltas, and, estuaries, some, species, inhabit, freshwater, environments, exclusively, while, others, primarily, inhabit, marine, environments, near, coastal, areas, and, are, known, to, venture, into, open, ocean, several, species, of, sturgeon, are, harvested, for, their, roe, which, is, processed, into, the, luxury, food, caviar, this, has, led, to, serious, overexploitation, which, combined, with, other, conservation, threats, has, brought, most, of, the, species, to, critically, endangered, status, at, the, edge, of, extinction, acipenseriform, fishes, appeared, in, the, fossil, record, some, 174, to, 201, million, years, ago, during, the, early, jurassic, making, them, some, of, the, earliest, extant, actinopterygian, fishes, true, sturgeons, appear, in, the, fossil, record, during, the, upper, cretaceous, with, amongst, the, oldest, known, remains, being, a, partial, skull, from, the, cenomanian, 100, 94, million, years, ago, of, alberta, canada, in, that, time, sturgeons, have, undergone, remarkably, little, morphological, change, indicating, their, evolution, has, been, exceptionally, slow, and, earning, them, informal, status, as, living, fossils, this, is, explained, in, part, by, the, long, generation, interval, tolerance, for, wide, ranges, of, temperature, and, salinity, lack, of, predators, due, to, size, and, bony, plated, armor, or, scutes, and, the, abundance, of, prey, items, in, the, benthic, environment, they, do, however, still, share, several, primitive, characteristics, such, as, heterocercal, tail, reduced, squamation, more, fin, rays, than, supporting, bony, elements, and, unique, jaw, suspension, despite, the, existence, of, a, fossil, record, full, classification, and, phylogeny, of, the, sturgeon, species, has, been, difficult, to, determine, in, part, due, to, the, high, individual, and, ontogenic, variation, including, geographical, clines, in, certain, features, such, as, rostrum, shape, number, of, scutes, and, body, length, a, further, confounding, factor, is, the, peculiar, ability, of, sturgeons, to, produce, reproductively, viable, hybrids, even, between, species, assigned, to, different, genera, while, ray, finned, fishes, actinopterygii, have, a, long, evolutionary, history, culminating, in, the, most, familiar, fishes, past, adaptive, evolutionary, radiations, have, left, only, a, few, survivors, such, as, sturgeons, and, gars, the, wide, range, of, the, acipenserids, and, their, endangered, status, have, made, collection, of, systematic, materials, difficult, the, factors, have, led, researchers, in, the, past, to, identify, over, 40, additional, species, that, were, rejected, by, later, scientists, whether, the, species, in, the, acipenser, and, huso, genera, are, monophyletic, descended, from, one, ancestor, or, paraphyletic, descended, from, many, ancestors, is, still, unclear, though, the, morphologically, motivated, division, between, these, two, genera, clearly, is, not, supported, by, the, genetic, evidence, an, effort, is, ongoing, to, resolve, the, taxonomic, confusion, using, a, continuing, synthesis, of, systematic, data, and, molecular, techniques, the, phylogeny, of, acipenseridae, as, in, the, cladogram, shows, that, they, evolved, from, the, bony, fishes, approximate, dates, are, from, near, et, al, 2012, coelacanths, lungfish, tetrapods, polypteriformes, bichirs, reedfishes, acipenseridae, polyodontidae, lepisosteiformes, gars, amiiformes, bowfins, teleostei, in, currently, accepted, taxonomy, the, class, actinopterygii, and, the, order, acipenseriformes, are, both, clades, the, family, acipenseridae, is, subdivided, into, 2, subfamilies, acipenserinae, including, the, genera, acipenser, and, huso, and, scaphirhynchinae, including, the, genera, scaphirhynchus, and, pseudoscaphirhynchus, however, multiple, recent, studies, have, recovered, this, arrangement, as, paraphyletic, instead, finding, a, oxyrhinchus, and, a, sturio, to, form, the, most, basal, clade, among, sturgeons, and, all, other, species, being, in, a, separate, clade, with, the, various, other, species, of, acipenser, scaphirhynchus, pseudoscaphirhynchus, and, huso, to, have, varying, levels, of, relationship, with, one, another, a, potential, taxonomy, of, acipenseridae, is, shown, here, based, on, luo, et, al, 2019, nedoluzhko, et, al, 2020, and, shen, et, al, 2020, note, the, paraphyletic, relationships, among, genera, a, oxyrhinchus, a, sturio, a, dabryanus, a, schrenckii, a,

ruthenus, a, nudiventris, a, fulvescens, a, brevirostrum, a, baerii, a, sinensis, a, gueldenstaedtii, the, exact, placement, of, scaphirhynchus, varies, depending, on, the, study, and, the, methods, used, with, some, placing, it, within, the, second, most, basal, clade, comprising, primarily, pacific, species, shown, above, whereas, others, place, it, in, its, own, clade, that, is, more, derived, than, the, secondmost, basal, clade, but, less, derived, than, the, most, derived, atlantic, and, central, asian, clade, no, studies, have, yet, delineated, a, relationship, between, it, and, pseudoscaphirhynchus, in, addition, the, exact, relationships, of, the, members, of, the, most, derived, primarily, atlantic, clade, vary, although, most, analyses, at, least, find, all, the, species, in, it, to, form, a, monophyletic, clade, the, placement, of, a, sinensis, also, varies, by, the, study, with, some, placing, it, as, the, only, pacific, member, of, the, otherwise, atlantic, based, most, derived, clade, whereas, others, place, it, with, the, rest, of, the, pacific, sturgeons, as, a, sister, to, a, dabryanus, the, family, contains, 8, extinct, fossil, species, and, 28, extant, species, subspecies, include, 1, species, of, sterlet, and, 2, species, of, living, fossils, in, 4, genera, this, list, uses, the, original, classification, scheme, family, acipenseridae, sturgeon, range, from, subtropical, to, subarctic, waters, in, north, america, and, eurasia, in, north, america, they, range, along, the, atlantic, coast, from, the, gulf, of, mexico, to, newfoundland, including, the, great, lakes, and, the, st, lawrence, missouri, and, mississippi, rivers, as, well, as, along, the, west, coast, in, major, rivers, from, california, and, idaho, to, british, columbia, they, occur, along, the, european, atlantic, coast, including, the, mediterranean, basin, especially, in, the, adriatic, sea, and, the, rivers, of, north, italy, in, the, rivers, that, flow, into, the, black, azov, and, caspian, seas, danube, dnepr, volga, ural, and, don, the, north, flowing, rivers, of, russia, that, feed, the, arctic, ocean, ob, yenisei, lena, kolyma, in, the, rivers, of, central, asia, amu, darya, and, syr, darya, and, lake, baikal, in, the, pacific, ocean, they, are, found, in, the, amur, river, along, the, russian, chinese, border, on, sakhalin, island, and, some, rivers, in, northeast, china, throughout, this, extensive, range, almost, all, species, are, highly, threatened, or, vulnerable, to, extinction, due, to, a, combination, of, habitat, destruction, overfishing, and, pollution, no, species, is, known, to, naturally, occur, south, of, the, equator, though, attempts, at, sturgeon, aquaculture, are, being, made, in, uruguay, south, africa, and, other, places, most, species, are, at, least, partially, anadromous, spawning, in, fresh, water, and, feeding, in, nutrient, rich, brackish, waters, of, estuaries, or, undergoing, significant, migrations, along, coastlines, however, some, species, have, evolved, purely, freshwater, existences, such, as, the, lake, sturgeon, acipenser, fulvescens, and, the, baikal, sturgeon, a, baerii, baicalensis, or, have, been, forced, into, them, by, human, or, natural, impoundment, of, their, native, rivers, as, in, the, case, of, some, subpopulations, of, white, sturgeon, a, transmontanus, in, the, columbia, river, and, siberian, sturgeon, a, baerii, in, the, ob, basin, sturgeons, retain, several, primitive, characteristics, from, the, bony, fishes, along, with, other, members, of, the, subclass, chondrostei, they, are, unique, among, bony, fishes, because, their, skeletons, are, almost, entirely, cartilaginous, to, maintain, structure, sturgeons, are, one, of, few, organisms, to, retain, a, post, embryonic, notochord, that, acts, like, a, soft, spine, running, through, the, body, notably, however, the, cartilaginous, skeleton, is, not, a, primitive, character, but, a, derived, one, sturgeon, ancestors, had, bony, skeletons, they, also, lack, vertebral, centra, and, are, partially, covered, with, five, lateral, rows, of, scutes, rather, than, scales, they, also, have, four, barbels, sensory, organs, that, precede, their, wide, toothless, mouths, they, navigate, their, riverine, habitats, traveling, just, off, the, bottom, with, their, barbels, dragging, along, gravel, or, murky, substrate, sturgeon, are, recognizable, for, their, elongated, bodies, flattened, rostra, distinctive, scutes, and, barbels, and, elongated, upper, tail, lobes, the, skeletal, support, for, the, paired, fins, of, ray, finned, fish, is, inside, the, body, wall, although, the, ray, like, structures, in, the, webbing, of, the, fins, can, be, seen, externally, sturgeons, are, among, the, largest, fish, some, beluga, huso, huso, in, the, caspian, sea, reportedly, attain, over, 5, 5, metres, 18, ft, and, 2, 000, kilograms, 4, 400, lb, while, for, kaluga, h, dauricus, in, the, amur, river, similar, lengths, and, over, 1, 000, kg, 2, 200, lb, weights, have, been, reported, they, are, also, among, the, longest, lived, of, the, fishes, some, living, well, over, 100, years, and, attaining, sexual, maturity, at, 20, years, or, more, the, combination, of, slow, growth, and, reproductive, rates, and, the, extremely, high, value, placed, on, mature, egg, bearing, females, make, sturgeon, particularly, vulnerable, to, overfishing, sturgeons, are, polyploid, some, species, have, four, eight, or, 16, sets, of, chromosomes, sturgeons, are, long, lived, late, maturing, fishes, their, average, lifespan, is, 50, to, 60, years, and, their, first, spawn, does, not, occur, until, they, are, around, 15, to, 20, years, old, sturgeons, are, broadcast, spawners, and, do, not, spawn, every, year, because, they, require, specific, conditions, those, requirements, may, or, may, not, be, met, every, year, due, to, varying, environmental, conditions, such, as, the, proper, photoperiod, in, spring, clear, water, with, shallow, rock, or, gravel, substrate, where, the, eggs, can, adhere, and, proper, water, temperature, and, flow, for, oxygenation, of, the, eggs, a, single, female, may, release, 100, 000, to, 3, million, eggs, but, not, all, will, be, fertilized, the, fertilized, eggs, become, sticky, and, adhere, to, the, bottom, substrate, upon, contact, eight, to, 15, days, are, needed, for, the, embryos, to, mature, into, larval, fish, during, that, time, they, are, dependent, on, their, yolk, sacs, for, nourishment, river, currents, carry, the, larvae, downstream, into, backwater, areas, such, as, oxbows, and, sloughs, where, the, free, swimming, fry, spend, their, first, year, feeding, on, insect, larvae, and, crustacea, during, their, first, year, of, growth, they, reach, 18, to, 20, cm, 7, to, 8, in, in, length, and, migrate, back, into, the, swift, flowing, currents, in, the, main, stem, river, sturgeons, are, primarily, benthic, feeders, with, a, diet, of, shellfish, crustaceans, and, small, fish, exceptionally, both, huso, species, the, white, sturgeon, and, the, pallid, sturgeon, feed, primarily, on, other, fish, as, adults, they, feed, by, extending, their, siphon, like, mouths, to, suck, food, from, the, benthos, having, no, teeth, they, are, unable, to, seize, prey, though, larger, individuals, and, more, predatory, species, can, swallow, very, large, prey, items, including, whole, salmon, sturgeons, feed, non, visually, they, are, believed, to, use, a, combination, of, sensors, including, olfactory, tactile, and, chemosensory, cues, detected, by, the, four, barbels, and, electroreception, using, their, ampullae, of, lorenzini, the, sturgeons, electroreceptors, are, located, on, the, head, and, are, sensitive, to, weak, electric, fields, generated, by, other, animals, or, geoelectric, sources, the, electroreceptors, are, thought, to, be, used, in, various, behaviors, such, as, feeding, mating, and, migration, many, sturgeons, leap, completely, out, of, the, water, usually, making, a, loud, splash, which, can, be, heard, half, a, mile, away, on, the, surface, and, probably, further, under, water, why, they, do, this, is, not, known, but, suggested, functions, include, group, communication, to, maintain, group, cohesion, catching, airborne, prey, courtship, display, or, to, help, shed, eggs, during, spawning, other, plausible, explanations, include, escape, from, predators, shedding, parasites, or, to, gulp, or, expel, air, another, explanation, is, that, it, simply, feels, good, there, have, been, some, incidents, of, leaping, sturgeon, landing, in, boats, and, causing, injuries, to, humans, in, 2015, a, 5, year, old, girl, was, fatally, injured, after, a, sturgeon, leapt, from, the, suwannee, river, and, struck, her, in, 1731, an, observer, of, leaping, sturgeon, wrote, in, may, june, and, july, the, rivers, abound, with, them, at, which, time, it, is, surprising, though, very, common, to, see, such, large, fish, elated, in, the, air, by, their, leaping, some, yards, out, of, the, water, this, they, do, in, an, erect, posture, and, fall, on, their, sides, which, repeated, percussions, are, loudly, heard, some, miles, distance, globally, sturgeon, fisheries, are, of, great, value, primarily, as, a, source, for, caviar, but, also, for, flesh, several, species, of, sturgeon, are, harvested, for, their, roe, which, is, processed, into, caviar, a, delicacy, and, the, reason, why, caviar, producing, sturgeons, are, among, the, most, valuable, and, endangered, of, all, wildlife, resources, during, the, 19th, century, the, us, was, the, global, leader, in, caviar, production, having, cornered, 90, of, the, world, s, caviar, trade, atlantic, sturgeon, once, thrived, along, the, east, coast, from, canada, down, to, florida, they, were, in, such, abundance, in, the, hudson, river, that, they, were, humorously, called, albany, beef, and, sturgeon, eggs, were, given, away, at, local, bars, as, an, accompaniment, to, 5, beer, white, sturgeon, populations, along, the, us, west, coast, declined, simultaneously, under, the, pressure, of, commercial, fishing, and, human, encroachment, within, the, course, of, a, century, the, once, abundant, sturgeon, fisheries, in, the, us, and, canada, had, drastically, declined, and, in, some, areas, had, been, extirpated, under, the, pressure, of, commercial, overharvesting, pollution, human, encroachment, habitat, loss, and, the, damming, of, rivers, that, blocked, their, ancestral, migration, to, spawning, grounds, by, the, turn, of, the, century, commercial, production, of, sturgeon, caviar, in, the, us, and, canada, had, come, to, an, end, regulatory, protections, and, conservation, efforts, were, put, in, place, by, state, and, federal, resource, agencies, in, the, us, and, canada, such, as, the, 1998, us, federal, moratorium, that, closed, all, commercial, fishing, for, atlantic, sturgeon, it, was, during, the, 20th, century, that, russia, grew, to, become, the, global, leader, as, the, largest, producer, and, exporter, of, caviar, as, with, the, decline, in, sturgeon, populations, in, the, us, and, canada, the, same, occurred, with, sturgeon, populations, in, the, caspian, sea, beginning, with, the, 1979, us, embargo, on, iran, poaching, and, smuggling, sturgeon, caviar, was, big, business, but, an, illegal, and, dangerous, one, officers, with, the, washington, department, of, fish, and, wildlife, wdfw, busted, a, poaching, ring, that, was, based, in, vancouver, washington, the, poachers, had, harvested, 1, 65, tons, of, caviar, from, nearly, 2, 000, white, sturgeon, that, were, poached, from, the, columbia, river, the, caviar, was, estimated, to, be, worth, around, 2, million, wdfw, busted, another, ring, in, 2003, and, conducted, an, undercover, sting, operation, in, 2006, 2007, that, resulted, in, 17, successful, attempts, out, of, a, total, of, 19, in, response, to, concerns, over, the, future, of, sturgeons, and, associated, commercial, products, international, trade, for, all, species, of, sturgeons, has, been, regulated, under, cites, since, 1998, sturgeons, are, threatened, by, the, negative, impacts, of, overfishing, poaching, habitat, destruction, and, the, construction, of, dams, that, have, altered, or, blocked, their, annual, migration, to, ancestral, spawning, grounds, some, species, of, sturgeon, are, extinct, and, several, are, on, the, verge, of, extinction, including, the, chinese, sturgeon, the, highly, prized, beluga, sturgeon, and, the, alabama, sturgeon, many, species, are, classified, as, threatened, or, endangered, with, noticeable, declines, in, sturgeon, populations, as, the, demand, for, caviar, increases, iucn, data, indicates, that, over, 85, of, sturgeon, species, are, at, risk, of, extinction, making, them, more, critically, endangered, than, any, other, group, of, animal, species, in, addition, to, global, restocking, efforts, the, monitoring, of, populations, and, habitat, and, various, other, conservation, efforts, by, national, and, state, resource, agencies, as, applicable, to, their, respective, countries, several, conservation, organizations, have, been, formed, to, assist, in, the, preservation, of, sturgeons, around, the, world, on, a, global, scale, one, such, organization, is, the, world, sturgeon, conservation, society, wscs, whose, primary, objectives, include, fostering, the, conservation, of, sturgeon, species, and, restoration, of, sturgeon, stocks, world, wide, and, supporting, the, information, exchange, among, all, persons, interested, in, sturgeons, the, north, american, sturgeon, and, paddlefish, society, nasps, and, gesellschaft, zur, rettung, des, st, rs, e, v, are, wscs, affiliates, wscs, has, been, instrumental, in, organizing, global, conferences, where, scientists, and, researchers, can, exchange, information, and, address, the, various, conservation, challenges, that, threaten, the, future, of, sturgeons, conservation, efforts, at, the, grass, roots, level, are, also, instrumental, in, helping, to, preserve, sturgeon, populations, such, as, sturgeon, for, tomorrow, which, was, founded, in, 1977, consists, of, volunteers, and, a, sturgeon, guarding, program, to, monitor, known, spawning, sites, the, organization, has, grown, exponentially, over, the, years, and, has, become, the, largest, citizen, advocacy, group, for, sturgeon, in, the, world, and, has, expanded, with, affiliate, chapters, in, other, states, that, have, sturgeon, populations, other, projects, focus, on, specific, local, issues, such, as, the, we, pass, project, seeking, a, solution, to, the, migratory, impasse, represented, by, the, iron, gates, in, the, danube, river, basin, for, example, currently, all, anadromous, danube, sturgeon, all, species, except, the, predominantly, freshwater, sterlet, are, now, classed, as, critically, endangered, or, extirpated, from, the, upper, and, middle, reaches, of, the, danube, river, above, the, dams, before, 1800, swim, bladders, of, sturgeon, primarily, beluga, sturgeon, from, russia, were, used, as, a, source, of, isinglass, a, form, of, collagen, used, historically, for, the, clarification, of, wine, and, beer, as, a, predecessor, for, gelatin, and, to, preserve, parchments, the, jewish, laws, of, kashrut, which, only, permit, the, consumption, of, fish, with, both, scales, and, fins, forbids, sturgeon, as, they, have, ganoid, scales, instead, of, the, permitted, ctenoid, and, cycloid, scales, while, all, orthodox, groups, forbid, the, consumption, of, sturgeon, some, conservative, groups, do, allow, it, the, theological, debate, over, its, kosher, status, can, be, traced, back, to, such, 19th, century, reformers, as, aron, chorin, though, its, consumption, was, already, common, in, european, jewish, communities, sturgeons, were, declared, to, be, a, royal, fish, under, a, statute, dating, back, to, 1324, by, king, edward, ii, of, england, technically, the, british, monarchy, still, owns, all, sturgeons, whales, and, dolphins, that, inhabit, the, waters, around, england, and, wales, under, the, law, of, the, united, kingdom, any, sturgeons, captured, within, the, realm, are, personal, property, of, the, monarch, similar, laws, reserving, sturgeon, for, the, king, were, enforced, in, late, medieval, denmark, an, archaeological, example, of, sturgeon, in, a, royal, context, comes, from, the, wreck, of, the, danish, norwegian, flagship, gribshunden, which, sank, in, june, 1495, while, king, hans, sailed, from, copenhagen, to, kalmar, sweden, for, a, diplomatic, summit, archaeologists, recovered, from, the, wreck, a, cask, containing, a, butchered, sturgeon, probably, intended, for, the, king, s, table, during, feasts, in, kalmar, in, heraldry, a, sturgeon, is, the, symbol, on, the, coat, of, arms, for, saint, amalberga, of, temse
