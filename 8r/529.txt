salmonidae, s, l, m, n, d, i, lit, salmon, like, is, a, family, of, ray, finned, fish, that, constitutes, the, only, currently, extant, family, in, the, order, salmoniformes, s, l, m, n, f, r, m, i, z, lit, salmon, shaped, consisting, of, 11, extant, genera, and, over, 200, species, collectively, known, as, salmonids, or, salmonoids, the, family, includes, salmon, both, atlantic, and, pacific, species, trout, both, ocean, going, and, landlocked, char, graylings, freshwater, whitefishes, taimens, and, lenoks, all, coldwater, mid, level, predatory, fish, that, inhabit, the, subarctic, and, cool, temperate, waters, of, the, northern, hemisphere, the, atlantic, salmon, salmo, salar, whose, latin, name, became, that, of, its, genus, salmo, is, also, the, eponym, of, the, family, and, order, names, salmonids, have, a, relatively, primitive, appearance, among, teleost, fish, with, the, pelvic, fins, being, placed, far, back, and, an, adipose, fin, towards, the, rear, of, the, back, they, have, slender, bodies, with, rounded, scales, and, forked, tail, fins, and, their, mouths, contain, a, single, row, of, sharp, teeth, although, the, smallest, salmonid, species, is, just, 13, cm, 5, 1, in, long, for, adults, most, salmonids, are, much, larger, with, the, largest, reaching, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, all, salmonids, are, migratory, fish, that, spawn, in, the, shallow, gravel, beds, of, freshwater, headstreams, spend, the, growing, juvenile, years, in, rivers, creeks, small, lakes, and, wetlands, but, migrate, downstream, upon, maturity, and, spend, most, of, their, adult, lives, at, much, larger, waterbodies, many, salmonid, species, are, euryhaline, and, migrate, to, the, sea, or, brackish, estuaries, as, soon, as, they, approach, adulthood, returning, to, the, upper, streams, only, to, reproduce, such, sea, run, life, cycle, is, described, as, anadromous, and, other, freshwater, salmonids, that, migrate, purely, between, lakes, and, rivers, are, considered, potamodromous, salmonids, are, carnivorous, predators, of, the, middle, food, chain, feeding, on, smaller, fish, crustaceans, aquatic, insects, and, larvae, tadpoles, and, sometimes, fish, eggs, even, those, of, their, own, kind, and, in, turn, being, preyed, upon, by, larger, predators, many, species, of, salmonids, are, thus, considered, keystone, organisms, important, for, both, freshwater, and, terrestrial, ecosystems, due, to, the, biomass, transfer, provided, by, their, mass, migration, from, oceanic, to, inland, waterbodies, current, salmonids, comprise, three, main, clades, taxonomically, treated, as, subfamilies, coregoninae, freshwater, whitefishes, thymallinae, graylings, and, salmoninae, trout, salmon, char, taimens, and, lenoks, generally, all, three, lineages, are, accepted, to, allocate, a, suite, of, derived, traits, indicating, a, monophyletic, group, the, order, salmoniformes, first, appeared, during, the, santonian, and, campanian, stages, of, the, late, cretaceous, and, is, most, closely, related, to, pike, and, mudminnows, in, the, order, esociformes, to, the, extent, that, some, authors, have, grouped, the, esociformes, within, the, salmoniformes, although, it, is, assumed, that, salmon, and, pike, diverged, from, one, another, during, the, cretaceous, no, definitive, salmonids, appear, before, the, eocene, the, salmonidae, first, appear, in, the, fossil, record, in, the, early, eocene, with, eosalmo, driftwoodensis, a, stem, salmonine, which, was, first, described, from, fossils, found, at, driftwood, creek, central, british, columbia, and, has, been, recovered, from, most, sites, in, the, eocene, okanagan, highlands, this, genus, shares, traits, found, in, all, three, subfamily, lineages, hence, e, driftwoodensis, is, an, archaic, salmonid, representing, an, important, stage, in, salmonid, evolution, fossil, scales, of, coregonines, are, known, from, the, late, eocene, or, early, oligocene, of, california, a, gap, appears, in, the, salmonine, fossil, record, after, e, driftwoodensis, until, about, 7, million, years, ago, mya, in, the, late, miocene, when, trout, like, fossils, appear, in, idaho, in, the, clarkia, lake, beds, several, of, these, species, appear, to, be, oncorhynchus, the, current, genus, for, pacific, salmon, and, pacific, trout, the, presence, of, these, species, so, far, inland, established, that, oncorhynchus, was, not, only, present, in, the, pacific, drainages, before, the, beginning, of, the, pliocene, 5, 6, mya, but, also, that, rainbow, and, cutthroat, trout, and, pacific, salmon, lineages, had, diverged, before, the, beginning, of, the, pliocene, consequently, the, split, between, oncorhynchus, and, salmo, atlantic, salmon, and, european, trout, must, have, occurred, well, before, the, pliocene, suggestions, have, gone, back, as, far, as, the, early, miocene, about, 20, mya, based, on, the, most, current, evidence, salmonids, diverged, from, the, rest, of, teleost, fish, no, later, than, 88, million, years, ago, during, the, late, cretaceous, this, divergence, was, marked, by, a, whole, genome, duplication, event, in, the, ancestral, salmonid, where, the, diploid, ancestor, became, tetraploid, this, duplication, is, the, fourth, of, its, kind, to, happen, in, the, evolutionary, lineage, of, the, salmonids, with, two, having, occurred, commonly, to, all, bony, vertebrates, and, another, specifically, in, the, teleost, fishes, extant, salmonids, all, show, evidence, of, partial, tetraploidy, as, studies, show, the, genome, has, undergone, selection, to, regain, a, diploid, state, work, done, in, the, rainbow, trout, onchorhynchus, mykiss, has, shown, that, the, genome, is, still, partially, tetraploid, around, half, of, the, duplicated, protein, coding, genes, have, been, deleted, but, all, apparent, mirna, sequences, still, show, full, duplication, with, potential, to, influence, regulation, of, the, rainbow, trout, s, genome, this, pattern, of, partial, tetraploidy, is, thought, to, be, reflected, in, the, rest, of, extant, salmonids, the, first, fossil, species, representing, a, true, salmonid, fish, e, driftwoodensis, does, not, appear, until, the, middle, eocene, this, fossil, already, displays, traits, associated, with, extant, salmonids, but, as, the, genome, of, e, driftwoodensis, cannot, be, sequenced, it, cannot, be, confirmed, if, polyploidy, was, present, in, this, animal, at, this, point, in, time, this, fossil, is, also, significantly, younger, than, the, proposed, salmonid, divergence, from, the, rest, of, the, teleost, fishes, and, is, the, earliest, confirmed, salmonid, currently, known, this, means, that, the, salmonids, have, a, ghost, lineage, of, approximately, 33, million, years, given, a, lack, of, earlier, transition, fossils, and, the, inability, to, extract, genomic, data, from, specimens, other, than, extant, species, the, dating, of, the, whole, genome, duplication, event, in, salmonids, was, historically, a, very, broad, categorization, of, times, ranging, from, 25, to, 100, million, years, in, age, new, advances, in, calibrated, relaxed, molecular, clock, analyses, have, allowed, for, a, closer, examination, of, the, salmonid, genome, and, has, allowed, for, a, more, precise, dating, of, the, whole, genome, duplication, of, the, group, that, places, the, latest, possible, date, for, the, event, at, 88, million, years, ago, this, more, precise, dating, and, examination, of, the, salmonid, whole, genome, duplication, event, has, allowed, more, speculation, on, the, radiation, of, species, within, the, group, historically, the, whole, genome, duplication, event, was, thought, to, be, the, reason, for, the, variation, within, salmonidae, current, evidence, done, with, molecular, clock, analyses, revealed, that, much, of, the, speciation, of, the, group, occurred, during, periods, of, intense, climate, change, associated, with, the, last, ice, ages, with, especially, high, speciation, rates, being, observed, in, salmonids, that, developed, an, anadromous, lifestyle, together, with, the, closely, related, orders, esociformes, pikes, and, mudminnows, osmeriformes, true, smelts, and, argentiniformes, marine, smelts, and, barreleyes, salmoniformes, comprise, the, superorder, protacanthopterygii, the, only, extant, family, within, salmoniformes, salmonidae, is, divided, into, three, subfamilies, and, around, 10, genera, containing, about, 220, species, the, concepts, of, the, number, of, species, recognised, vary, among, researchers, and, authorities, the, numbers, presented, below, represent, the, higher, estimates, of, diversity, prosopium, stenodus, coregonus, thymallus, salmo, salvelinus,
