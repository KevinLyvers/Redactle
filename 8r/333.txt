a, craniate, is, a, member, of, the, craniata, sometimes, called, the, craniota, a, proposed, clade, of, chordate, animals, with, a, skull, of, hard, bone, or, cartilage, living, representatives, are, the, myxini, hagfishes, hyperoartia, including, lampreys, and, the, much, more, numerous, gnathostomata, jawed, vertebrates, formerly, distinct, from, vertebrates, by, excluding, hagfish, molecular, and, anatomical, research, in, the, 21st, century, has, led, to, the, reinclusion, of, hagfish, as, vertebrates, making, living, craniates, synonymous, with, living, vertebrates, the, clade, was, conceived, largely, on, the, basis, of, the, hyperoartia, lampreys, and, kin, being, more, closely, related, to, the, gnathostomata, jawed, vertebrates, than, the, myxini, hagfishes, this, combined, with, an, apparent, lack, of, vertebral, elements, within, the, myxini, suggested, that, the, myxini, were, descended, from, a, more, ancient, lineage, than, the, vertebrates, and, that, the, skull, developed, before, the, vertebral, column, the, clade, was, thus, composed, of, the, hyperoartia, and, the, vertebrates, and, any, extinct, chordates, with, skulls, however, recent, studies, using, molecular, phylogenetics, have, contradicted, this, view, with, evidence, that, the, cyclostomata, hyperoartia, and, myxini, is, monophyletic, this, suggests, that, the, myxini, are, degenerate, vertebrates, and, therefore, the, vertebrates, and, craniates, are, cladistically, equivalent, at, least, for, the, living, representatives, the, placement, of, the, myxini, within, the, vertebrates, has, been, further, strengthened, by, recent, anatomical, analysis, with, vestiges, of, a, vertebral, column, being, discovered, in, the, myxini, in, the, simplest, sense, craniates, are, chordates, with, well, defined, heads, thus, excluding, members, of, the, chordate, subphyla, tunicata, tunicates, and, cephalochordata, lancelets, but, including, myxini, which, have, cartilaginous, crania, and, tooth, like, structures, composed, of, keratin, craniata, also, includes, all, lampreys, and, armoured, jawless, fishes, armoured, jawed, fish, sharks, skates, and, rays, and, teleostomians, spiny, sharks, bony, fish, lissamphibians, temnospondyls, and, protoreptiles, sauropsids, and, mammals, the, craniate, head, consists, of, a, three, part, brain, neural, crest, which, gives, rise, to, many, cell, lineages, and, a, cranium, in, addition, to, distinct, crania, sing, cranium, craniates, possess, many, derived, characteristics, which, have, allowed, for, more, complexity, to, follow, molecular, genetic, analysis, of, craniates, reveals, that, compared, to, less, complex, animals, they, developed, duplicate, sets, of, many, gene, families, that, are, involved, in, cell, signaling, transcription, and, morphogenesis, see, homeobox, in, general, craniates, are, much, more, active, than, tunicates, and, lancelets, and, as, a, result, have, greater, metabolic, demands, as, well, as, several, anatomical, adaptations, aquatic, craniates, have, gill, slits, which, are, connected, to, muscles, to, pump, water, through, the, slits, engaging, in, both, feeding, and, gas, exchange, as, opposed, to, lancelets, whose, pharyngeal, slits, are, used, only, for, suspension, feeding, chiefly, by, cilia, mucus, rather, than, muscles, muscles, line, the, alimentary, canal, moving, food, through, the, canal, allowing, higher, craniates, such, as, mammals, to, develop, more, complex, digestive, systems, for, optimal, food, processing, craniates, have, cardiovascular, systems, that, include, a, heart, with, at, least, two, chambers, red, blood, cells, oxygen, transporting, hemoglobin, as, well, as, myoglobin, livers, and, kidneys, linnaeus, 1758, classified, hagfishes, as, vermes, a, class, for, non, arthropod, invertebrates, in, modern, nomenclature, dumeril, 1806, grouped, hagfishes, and, lampreys, in, the, taxon, cyclostomi, characterized, by, horny, teeth, borne, on, a, tongue, like, apparatus, a, large, notochord, as, adults, and, pouch, shaped, gills, marspibranchii, cyclostomes, were, regarded, as, either, degenerate, cartilaginous, fishes, or, primitive, vertebrates, cope, 1889, coined, the, name, agnatha, jawless, for, a, group, that, included, the, cyclostomes, and, a, number, of, fossil, groups, in, which, jaws, could, not, be, observed, vertebrates, were, subsequently, divided, into, two, major, sister, groups, the, agnatha, and, the, gnathostomata, jawed, vertebrates, stensi, 1927, suggested, that, the, two, groups, of, living, agnathans, i, e, the, cyclostomes, arose, independently, from, different, groups, of, fossil, agnathans, l, vtrup, 1977, argued, that, lampreys, are, more, closely, related, to, gnathostomes, based, on, a, number, of, uniquely, derived, characters, including, in, other, words, the, cyclostome, characteristics, e, g, horny, teeth, on, a, tongue, gill, pouches, are, either, instances, of, convergent, evolution, for, feeding, and, gill, ventilation, in, animals, with, an, eel, like, body, shape, or, represent, primitive, craniate, characteristics, subsequently, lost, or, modified, in, gnathostomes, on, this, basis, janvier, 1978, proposed, to, use, the, names, vertebrata, and, craniata, as, two, distinct, and, nested, taxa, the, validity, of, the, taxon, craniata, was, recently, examined, by, delarbre, et, al, 2002, using, mtdna, sequence, data, concluding, that, myxini, is, more, closely, related, to, hyperoartia, than, to, gnathostomata, i, e, that, modern, jawless, fishes, form, a, clade, called, cyclostomata, the, argument, is, that, if, cyclostomata, is, indeed, monophyletic, vertebrata, would, return, to, its, old, content, gnathostomata, cyclostomata, and, the, name, craniata, being, superfluous, would, become, a, junior, synonym, the, new, evidence, removes, support, for, the, hypothesis, for, the, evolutionary, sequence, by, which, from, among, tunicate, like, chordates, first, the, hard, cranium, arose, as, it, is, exhibited, by, the, hagfishes, then, the, backbone, as, exhibited, by, the, lampreys, and, then, finally, the, hinged, jaw, that, is, now, ubiquitous, in, 2010, philippe, janvier, stated, although, i, was, among, the, early, supporters, of, vertebrate, paraphyly, i, am, impressed, by, the, evidence, provided, by, heimberg, et, al, and, prepared, to, admit, that, cyclostomes, are, in, fact, monophyletic, the, consequence, is, that, they, may, tell, us, little, if, anything, about, the, dawn, of, vertebrate, evolution, except, that, the, intuitions, of, 19th, century, zoologists, were, correct, in, assuming, that, these, odd, vertebrates, notably, hagfishes, are, strongly, degenerate, and, have, lost, many, characters, over, time, phylogenetic, tree, of, the, chordate, phylum, lines, show, probable, evolutionary, relationships, including, extinct, taxa, which, are, denoted, with, a, dagger, some, are, invertebrates,
