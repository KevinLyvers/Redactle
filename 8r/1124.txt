the, sweet, potato, ipomoea, batatas, is, a, dicotyledonous, plant, that, belongs, to, the, bindweed, or, morning, glory, family, convolvulaceae, its, large, starchy, sweet, tasting, tuberous, roots, are, used, as, a, root, vegetable, the, young, shoots, and, leaves, are, sometimes, eaten, as, greens, cultivars, of, the, sweet, potato, have, been, bred, to, bear, tubers, with, flesh, and, skin, of, various, colors, sweet, potato, is, only, distantly, related, to, the, common, potato, solanum, tuberosum, both, being, in, the, order, solanales, although, darker, sweet, potatoes, are, often, referred, to, as, yams, in, parts, of, north, america, the, species, is, even, more, distant, from, the, true, yams, which, are, monocots, in, the, order, dioscoreales, the, sweet, potato, is, native, to, the, tropical, regions, of, south, america, in, what, is, present, day, ecuador, of, the, approximately, 50, genera, and, more, than, 1, 000, species, of, convolvulaceae, i, batatas, is, the, only, crop, plant, of, major, importance, some, others, are, used, locally, e, g, i, aquatica, kangkong, as, a, green, vegetable, but, many, are, poisonous, the, genus, ipomoea, that, contains, the, sweet, potato, also, includes, several, garden, flowers, called, morning, glories, but, that, term, is, not, usually, extended, to, i, batatas, some, cultivars, of, i, batatas, are, grown, as, ornamental, plants, under, the, name, tuberous, morning, glory, and, used, in, a, horticultural, context, sweet, potatoes, can, also, be, called, yams, in, north, america, when, soft, varieties, were, first, grown, commercially, there, there, was, a, need, to, differentiate, between, the, two, enslaved, africans, had, already, been, calling, the, soft, sweet, potatoes, yams, because, they, resembled, the, unrelated, yams, in, africa, thus, soft, sweet, potatoes, were, referred, to, as, yams, to, distinguish, them, from, the, firm, varieties, the, plant, is, a, herbaceous, perennial, vine, bearing, alternate, triangle, shaped, or, palmately, lobed, leaves, and, medium, sized, sympetalous, flowers, the, stems, are, usually, crawling, on, the, ground, and, form, adventitious, roots, at, the, nodes, the, leaves, are, screwed, along, the, stems, the, leaf, stalk, is, 13, to, 51, centimetres, 5, to, 20, inches, long, the, leaf, blades, are, very, variable, 5, to, 13, cm, 2, to, 5, in, long, the, shape, is, heart, kidney, to, egg, shaped, rounded, or, triangular, and, spear, shaped, the, edge, can, be, entire, toothed, or, often, three, to, seven, times, lobed, cut, or, divided, most, of, the, leaf, surfaces, are, bare, rarely, hairy, and, the, tip, is, rounded, to, pointed, the, leaves, are, mostly, green, in, color, but, the, accumulation, of, anthocyanins, especially, along, the, leaf, veins, can, make, them, purple, depending, on, the, variety, the, total, length, of, a, stem, can, be, between, 0, 5, and, 4, metres, 1, 1, 2, and, 13, feet, some, cultivars, also, form, shoots, up, to, 16, m, 52, ft, in, length, however, these, do, not, form, underground, storage, organs, the, hermaphrodite, five, fold, and, short, stalked, flowers, are, single, or, few, in, stalked, zymous, inflorescences, that, arise, from, the, leaf, axils, and, stand, upright, it, produces, flowers, when, the, day, is, short, the, small, sepals, are, elongated, and, tapering, to, a, point, and, spiky, and, rarely, only, 7, 10, to, 15, millimetres, 3, 8, to, 5, 8, in, long, usually, finely, haired, or, ciliate, the, inner, three, are, a, little, longer, the, 4, to, 7, cm, 1, 1, 2, to, 2, 3, 4, in, long, overgrown, and, funnel, shaped, folded, crown, with, a, shorter, hem, can, be, lavender, to, purple, lavender, in, color, the, throat, is, usually, darker, in, color, but, white, crowns, can, also, appear, the, enclosed, stamens, are, of, unequal, length, with, glandular, filaments, the, two, chamber, ovary, is, upper, constant, with, a, relatively, short, stylus, seeds, are, only, produced, from, cross, pollination, the, flowers, open, before, sunrise, and, stay, open, for, a, few, hours, they, close, again, in, the, morning, and, begin, to, wither, the, edible, tuberous, root, is, long, and, tapered, with, a, smooth, skin, whose, color, ranges, between, yellow, orange, red, brown, purple, and, beige, its, flesh, ranges, from, beige, through, white, red, pink, violet, yellow, orange, and, purple, sweet, potato, cultivars, with, white, or, pale, yellow, flesh, are, less, sweet, and, moist, than, those, with, red, pink, or, orange, flesh, the, sweet, potato, originates, in, south, america, in, what, is, present, day, ecuador, the, domestication, of, sweet, potato, occurred, in, either, central, or, south, america, in, central, america, domesticated, sweet, potatoes, were, present, at, least, 5, 000, years, ago, with, the, origin, of, i, batatas, possibly, between, the, yucat, n, peninsula, of, mexico, and, the, mouth, of, the, orinoco, river, in, venezuela, the, cultigen, was, most, likely, spread, by, local, people, to, the, caribbean, and, south, america, by, 2500, bce, i, trifida, a, diploid, is, the, closest, wild, relative, of, the, sweet, potato, which, originated, with, an, initial, cross, between, a, tetraploid, and, another, diploid, parent, followed, by, a, second, complete, genome, duplication, event, the, oldest, radiocarbon, dating, remains, of, the, sweet, potato, known, today, were, discovered, in, caves, from, the, chilca, canyon, in, the, south, central, zone, of, peru, and, yield, an, age, of, 8080, 170, bc, the, genome, of, cultivated, sweet, potatoes, contains, sequences, of, dna, from, agrobacterium, sensu, lato, specifically, one, related, to, rhizobium, rhizogenes, with, genes, actively, expressed, by, the, plants, the, t, dna, transgenes, were, not, observed, in, closely, related, wild, relatives, of, the, sweet, potato, studies, indicated, that, the, sweet, potato, genome, evolved, over, millennia, with, eventual, domestication, of, the, crop, taking, advantage, of, natural, genetic, modifications, these, observations, make, sweet, potatoes, the, first, known, example, of, a, naturally, transgenic, food, crop, 141, before, the, arrival, of, europeans, to, the, americas, sweet, potato, was, grown, in, polynesia, generally, spread, by, vine, cuttings, rather, than, by, seeds, sweet, potato, has, been, radiocarbon, dated, in, the, cook, islands, to, 1210, 1400, ce, a, common, hypothesis, is, that, a, vine, cutting, was, brought, to, central, polynesia, by, polynesians, who, had, traveled, to, south, america, and, back, and, spread, from, there, across, polynesia, to, easter, island, hawaii, and, new, zealand, genetic, similarities, have, been, found, between, polynesian, peoples, and, indigenous, americans, including, the, zen, a, people, inhabiting, the, pacific, coast, of, present, day, colombia, indicating, that, polynesians, could, have, visited, south, america, and, taken, sweet, potatoes, prior, to, european, contact, dutch, linguists, and, specialists, in, amerindian, languages, willem, adelaar, and, pieter, muysken, have, suggested, that, the, word, for, sweet, potato, is, shared, by, polynesian, languages, and, languages, of, south, america, proto, polynesian, kumala, compare, rapa, nui, kumara, hawaiian, uala, m, ori, k, mara, may, be, connected, with, quechua, and, aymara, k, umar, k, umara, adelaar, and, muysken, assert, that, the, similarity, in, the, word, for, sweet, potato, is, proof, of, either, incidental, contact, or, sporadic, contact, between, the, central, andes, and, polynesia, some, researchers, citing, divergence, time, estimates, suggest, that, sweet, potatoes, might, have, been, present, in, polynesia, thousands, of, years, before, humans, arrived, there, however, the, present, scholarly, consensus, favours, the, pre, columbian, contact, model, the, sweet, potato, arrived, in, europe, with, the, columbian, exchange, it, is, recorded, for, example, in, elinor, fettiplace, s, receipt, book, compiled, in, england, in, 1604, sweet, potatoes, were, first, introduced, to, the, philippines, during, the, spanish, colonial, period, 1521, 1898, via, the, manila, galleons, along, with, other, new, world, crops, it, was, introduced, to, the, fujian, province, of, china, in, about, 1594, from, luzon, in, response, to, a, major, crop, failure, the, growing, of, sweet, potatoes, was, encouraged, by, the, governor, chin, hs, eh, tseng, jin, xuezeng, sweet, potatoes, were, also, introduced, to, the, ryukyu, kingdom, present, day, okinawa, japan, in, the, early, 1600s, by, the, portuguese, sweet, potatoes, became, a, staple, in, japan, because, they, were, important, in, preventing, famine, when, rice, harvests, were, poor, aoki, kony, helped, popularize, the, cultivation, of, the, sweet, potato, in, japan, and, the, tokugawa, bakufu, sponsored, published, and, disseminated, a, vernacular, japanese, translation, of, his, research, monograph, on, sweet, potatoes, to, encourage, their, growth, more, broadly, sweet, potatoes, were, planted, in, sh, gun, tokugawa, yoshimune, s, private, garden, it, was, first, introduced, to, korea, in, 1764, kang, p, il, ri, and, yi, kwang, ry, embarked, on, a, project, to, grow, sweet, potatoes, in, seoul, in, 1766, using, the, knowledge, of, japanese, cultivators, they, learned, in, tongnae, starting, in, 1764, the, project, succeeded, for, a, year, but, ultimately, failed, in, winter, 1767, after, kang, s, unexpected, death, although, the, soft, orange, sweet, potato, is, often, called, a, yam, in, parts, of, north, america, the, sweet, potato, is, very, distinct, from, the, botanical, yam, dioscorea, which, has, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, and, belongs, to, the, monocot, family, dioscoreaceae, a, different, crop, plant, the, oca, oxalis, tuberosa, a, species, of, wood, sorrel, is, called, a, yam, in, many, parts, of, the, world, although, the, sweet, potato, is, not, closely, related, botanically, to, the, common, potato, they, have, a, shared, etymology, the, first, europeans, to, taste, sweet, potatoes, were, members, of, christopher, columbus, s, expedition, in, 1492, later, explorers, found, many, cultivars, under, an, assortment, of, local, names, but, the, name, which, stayed, was, the, indigenous, ta, no, name, of, batata, the, spanish, combined, this, with, the, quechua, word, for, potato, papa, to, create, the, word, patata, for, the, common, potato, though, the, sweet, potato, is, also, called, batata, in, hebrew, this, is, not, a, direct, loan, of, the, ta, no, word, rather, the, spanish, patata, was, loaned, into, arabic, as, batata, owing, to, the, lack, of, a, p, sound, in, arabic, while, the, sweet, potato, was, called, batata, ilwa, literally, sweet, potato, the, arabic, batata, was, loaned, into, hebrew, as, designating, the, sweet, potato, only, as, hebrew, had, its, own, word, for, the, common, potato, tapuakh, adama, literally, earth, apple, compare, french, pomme, de, terre, some, organizations, and, researchers, advocate, for, the, styling, of, the, name, as, one, word, sweetpotato, instead, of, two, to, emphasize, the, plant, s, genetic, uniqueness, from, both, common, potatoes, and, yams, and, to, avoid, confusion, of, it, being, classified, as, a, type, of, common, potato, in, its, current, usage, in, american, english, the, styling, of, the, name, as, two, words, is, still, preferred, in, argentina, colombia, venezuela, puerto, rico, and, the, dominican, republic, the, sweet, potato, is, called, batata, in, brazil, the, sweet, potato, is, called, batata, doce, in, mexico, bolivia, peru, chile, central, america, and, the, philippines, the, sweet, potato, is, known, as, camote, alternatively, spelled, kamote, in, the, philippines, derived, from, the, nahuatl, word, camotli, in, peru, and, bolivia, the, general, word, in, quechua, for, the, sweet, potato, is, apichu, but, there, are, variants, used, such, as, khumara, kumar, ayacucho, quechua, and, kumara, bolivian, quechua, strikingly, similar, to, the, polynesian, name, kumara, and, its, regional, oceanic, cognates, kumala, umala, uala, etc, which, has, led, some, scholars, to, suspect, an, instance, of, pre, columbian, trans, oceanic, contact, this, theory, is, also, supported, by, genetic, evidence, in, australia, about, 90, of, production, is, devoted, to, the, orange, cultivar, beauregard, which, was, originally, developed, by, the, louisiana, agricultural, experiment, station, in, 1981, in, new, zealand, the, m, ori, varieties, bore, elongated, tubers, with, white, skin, and, a, whitish, flesh, which, points, to, pre, european, cross, pacific, travel, known, as, kumara, from, the, m, ori, language, k, mara, the, most, common, cultivar, now, is, the, red, owairaka, but, orange, beauregard, gold, purple, and, other, cultivars, are, also, grown, the, plant, does, not, tolerate, frost, it, grows, best, at, an, average, temperature, of, 24, c, 75, f, with, abundant, sunshine, and, warm, nights, annual, rainfalls, of, 750, 1, 000, mm, 30, 39, in, are, considered, most, suitable, with, a, minimum, of, 500, mm, 20, in, in, the, growing, season, the, crop, is, sensitive, to, drought, at, the, tuber, initiation, stage, 50, 60, days, after, planting, and, it, is, not, tolerant, to, waterlogging, which, may, cause, tuber, rots, and, reduce, the, growth, of, storage, roots, if, aeration, is, poor, depending, on, the, cultivar, and, conditions, tuberous, roots, mature, in, two, to, nine, months, with, care, early, maturing, cultivars, can, be, grown, as, an, annual, summer, crop, in, temperate, areas, such, as, the, eastern, united, states, and, china, sweet, potatoes, rarely, flower, when, the, daylight, is, longer, than, 11, hours, as, is, normal, outside, of, the, tropics, they, are, mostly, propagated, by, stem, or, root, cuttings, or, by, adventitious, shoots, called, slips, that, grow, out, from, the, tuberous, roots, during, storage, true, seeds, are, used, for, breeding, only, they, grow, well, in, many, farming, conditions, and, have, few, natural, enemies, pesticides, are, rarely, needed, sweet, potatoes, are, grown, on, a, variety, of, soils, but, well, drained, light, and, medium, textured, soils, with, a, ph, range, of, 4, 5, 7, 0, are, more, favorable, for, the, plant, they, can, be, grown, in, poor, soils, with, little, fertilizer, however, sweet, potatoes, are, very, sensitive, to, aluminum, toxicity, and, will, die, about, six, weeks, after, planting, if, lime, is, not, applied, at, planting, in, this, type, of, soil, because, they, are, sown, by, vine, cuttings, rather, than, seeds, sweet, potatoes, are, relatively, easy, to, plant, because, the, rapidly, growing, vines, shade, out, weeds, little, weeding, is, needed, a, commonly, used, herbicide, to, rid, the, soil, of, any, unwelcome, plants, that, may, interfere, with, growth, is, dcpa, also, known, as, dacthal, in, the, tropics, the, crop, can, be, maintained, in, the, ground, and, harvested, as, needed, for, market, or, home, consumption, in, temperate, regions, sweet, potatoes, are, most, often, grown, on, larger, farms, and, are, harvested, before, first, frosts, sweet, potatoes, are, cultivated, throughout, tropical, and, warm, temperate, regions, wherever, there, is, sufficient, water, to, support, their, growth, sweet, potatoes, became, common, as, a, food, crop, in, the, islands, of, the, pacific, ocean, south, india, uganda, and, other, african, countries, a, cultivar, of, the, sweet, potato, called, the, boniato, is, grown, in, the, caribbean, its, flesh, is, cream, colored, unlike, the, more, common, orange, hue, seen, in, other, cultivars, boniatos, are, not, as, sweet, and, moist, as, other, sweet, potatoes, but, their, consistency, and, delicate, flavor, are, different, from, the, common, orange, colored, sweet, potato, sweet, potatoes, have, been, a, part, of, the, diet, in, the, u, s, for, most, of, its, history, especially, in, the, southeast, the, average, per, capita, consumption, of, sweet, potatoes, in, the, united, states, is, only, about, 1, 5, 2, kg, 3, 3, 4, 4, lb, per, year, down, from, 13, kg, 29, lb, in, 1920, orange, sweet, potatoes, the, most, common, type, encountered, in, the, us, received, higher, appearance, liking, scores, compared, with, yellow, or, purple, cultivars, purple, and, yellow, sweet, potatoes, were, not, as, well, liked, by, consumers, compared, to, orange, sweet, potatoes, possibly, because, of, the, familiarity, of, orange, color, that, is, associated, with, sweet, potatoes, in, the, southeastern, u, s, sweet, potatoes, are, traditionally, cured, to, improve, storage, flavor, and, nutrition, and, to, allow, wounds, on, the, periderm, of, the, harvested, root, to, heal, proper, curing, requires, drying, the, freshly, dug, roots, on, the, ground, for, two, to, three, hours, then, storage, at, 29, 32, c, 85, 90, f, with, 90, to, 95, relative, humidity, from, five, to, fourteen, days, cured, sweet, potatoes, can,
