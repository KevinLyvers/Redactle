animal, migration, is, the, relatively, long, distance, movement, of, individual, animals, usually, on, a, seasonal, basis, it, is, the, most, common, form, of, migration, in, ecology, it, is, found, in, all, major, animal, groups, including, birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and, crustaceans, the, cause, of, migration, may, be, local, climate, local, availability, of, food, the, season, of, the, year, or, for, mating, to, be, counted, as, a, true, migration, and, not, just, a, local, dispersal, or, irruption, the, movement, of, the, animals, should, be, an, annual, or, seasonal, occurrence, or, a, major, habitat, change, as, part, of, their, life, an, annual, event, could, include, northern, hemisphere, birds, migrating, south, for, the, winter, or, wildebeest, migrating, annually, for, seasonal, grazing, a, major, habitat, change, could, include, young, atlantic, salmon, or, sea, lamprey, leaving, the, river, of, their, birth, when, they, have, reached, a, few, inches, in, size, some, traditional, forms, of, human, migration, fit, this, pattern, migrations, can, be, studied, using, traditional, identification, tags, such, as, bird, rings, or, tracked, directly, with, electronic, tracking, devices, before, animal, migration, was, understood, folklore, explanations, were, formulated, for, the, appearance, and, disappearance, of, some, species, such, as, that, barnacle, geese, grew, from, goose, barnacles, migration, can, take, very, different, forms, in, different, species, and, has, a, variety, of, causes, as, such, there, is, no, simple, accepted, definition, of, migration, one, of, the, most, commonly, used, definitions, proposed, by, the, zoologist, j, s, kennedy, is, migratory, behavior, is, persistent, and, straightened, out, movement, effected, by, the, animal, s, own, locomotory, exertions, or, by, its, active, embarkation, on, a, vehicle, it, depends, on, some, temporary, inhibition, of, station, keeping, responses, but, promotes, their, eventual, disinhibition, and, recurrence, migration, encompasses, four, related, concepts, persistent, straight, movement, relocation, of, an, individual, on, a, greater, scale, in, both, space, and, time, than, its, normal, daily, activities, seasonal, to, and, fro, movement, of, a, population, between, two, areas, and, movement, leading, to, the, redistribution, of, individuals, within, a, population, migration, can, be, either, obligate, meaning, individuals, must, migrate, or, facultative, meaning, individuals, can, choose, to, migrate, or, not, within, a, migratory, species, or, even, within, a, single, population, often, not, all, individuals, migrate, complete, migration, is, when, all, individuals, migrate, partial, migration, is, when, some, individuals, migrate, while, others, do, not, and, differential, migration, is, when, the, difference, between, migratory, and, non, migratory, individuals, is, based, on, discernible, characteristics, like, age, or, sex, irregular, non, cyclical, migrations, such, as, irruptions, can, occur, under, pressure, of, famine, overpopulation, of, a, locality, or, some, more, obscure, influence, seasonal, migration, is, the, movement, of, various, species, from, one, habitat, to, another, during, the, year, resource, availability, changes, depending, on, seasonal, fluctuations, which, influence, migration, patterns, some, species, such, as, pacific, salmon, migrate, to, reproduce, every, year, they, swim, upstream, to, mate, and, then, return, to, the, ocean, temperature, is, a, driving, factor, of, migration, that, is, dependent, on, the, time, of, year, many, species, especially, birds, migrate, to, warmer, locations, during, the, winter, to, escape, poor, environmental, conditions, circadian, migration, is, where, birds, utilise, circadian, rhythm, cr, to, regulate, migration, in, both, fall, and, spring, in, circadian, migration, clocks, of, both, circadian, daily, and, circannual, annual, patterns, are, used, to, determine, the, birds, orientation, in, both, time, and, space, as, they, migrate, from, one, destination, to, the, next, this, type, of, migration, is, advantageous, in, birds, that, during, the, winter, remain, close, to, the, equator, and, also, allows, the, monitoring, of, the, auditory, and, spatial, memory, of, the, bird, s, brain, to, remember, an, optimal, site, of, migration, these, birds, also, have, timing, mechanisms, that, provide, them, with, the, distance, to, their, destination, tidal, migration, is, the, use, of, tides, by, organisms, to, move, periodically, from, one, habitat, to, another, this, type, of, migration, is, often, used, in, order, to, find, food, or, mates, tides, can, carry, organisms, horizontally, and, vertically, for, as, little, as, a, few, nanometres, to, even, thousands, of, kilometres, the, most, common, form, of, tidal, migration, is, to, and, from, the, intertidal, zone, during, daily, tidal, cycles, these, zones, are, often, populated, by, many, different, species, and, are, rich, in, nutrients, organisms, like, crabs, nematodes, and, small, fish, move, in, and, out, of, these, areas, as, the, tides, rise, and, fall, typically, about, every, twelve, hours, the, cycle, movements, are, associated, with, foraging, of, marine, and, bird, species, typically, during, low, tide, smaller, or, younger, species, will, emerge, to, forage, because, they, can, survive, in, the, shallower, water, and, have, less, chance, of, being, preyed, upon, during, high, tide, larger, species, can, be, found, due, to, the, deeper, water, and, nutrient, upwelling, from, the, tidal, movements, tidal, migration, is, often, facilitated, by, ocean, currents, while, most, migratory, movements, occur, on, an, annual, cycle, some, daily, movements, are, also, described, as, migration, many, aquatic, animals, make, a, diel, vertical, migration, travelling, a, few, hundred, metres, up, and, down, the, water, column, while, some, jellyfish, make, daily, horizontal, migrations, of, a, few, hundred, metres, different, kinds, of, animals, migrate, in, different, ways, approximately, 1, 800, of, the, world, s, 10, 000, bird, species, migrate, long, distances, each, year, in, response, to, the, seasons, many, of, these, migrations, are, north, south, with, species, feeding, and, breeding, in, high, northern, latitudes, in, the, summer, and, moving, some, hundreds, of, kilometres, south, for, the, winter, some, species, extend, this, strategy, to, migrate, annually, between, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, the, arctic, tern, has, the, longest, migration, journey, of, any, bird, it, flies, from, its, arctic, breeding, grounds, to, the, antarctic, and, back, again, each, year, a, distance, of, at, least, 19, 000, km, 12, 000, mi, giving, it, two, summers, every, year, bird, migration, is, controlled, primarily, by, day, length, signalled, by, hormonal, changes, in, the, bird, s, body, on, migration, birds, navigate, using, multiple, senses, many, birds, use, a, sun, compass, requiring, them, to, compensate, for, the, sun, s, changing, position, with, time, of, day, navigation, involves, the, ability, to, detect, magnetic, fields, most, fish, species, are, relatively, limited, in, their, movements, remaining, in, a, single, geographical, area, and, making, short, migrations, to, overwinter, to, spawn, or, to, feed, a, few, hundred, species, migrate, long, distances, in, some, cases, of, thousands, of, kilometres, about, 120, species, of, fish, including, several, species, of, salmon, migrate, between, saltwater, and, freshwater, they, are, diadromous, forage, fish, such, as, herring, and, capelin, migrate, around, substantial, parts, of, the, north, atlantic, ocean, the, capelin, for, example, spawn, around, the, southern, and, western, coasts, of, iceland, their, larvae, drift, clockwise, around, iceland, while, the, fish, swim, northwards, towards, jan, mayen, island, to, feed, and, return, to, iceland, parallel, with, greenland, s, east, coast, in, the, sardine, run, billions, of, southern, african, pilchard, sardinops, sagax, spawn, in, the, cold, waters, of, the, agulhas, bank, and, move, northward, along, the, east, coast, of, south, africa, between, may, and, july, some, winged, insects, such, as, locusts, and, certain, butterflies, and, dragonflies, with, strong, flight, migrate, long, distances, among, the, dragonflies, species, of, libellula, and, sympetrum, are, known, for, mass, migration, while, pantala, flavescens, known, as, the, globe, skimmer, or, wandering, glider, dragonfly, makes, the, longest, ocean, crossing, of, any, insect, between, india, and, africa, exceptionally, swarms, of, the, desert, locust, schistocerca, gregaria, flew, westwards, across, the, atlantic, ocean, for, 4, 500, kilometres, 2, 800, mi, during, october, 1988, using, air, currents, in, the, inter, tropical, convergence, zone, in, some, migratory, butterflies, such, as, the, monarch, butterfly, and, the, painted, lady, no, individual, completes, the, whole, migration, instead, the, butterflies, mate, and, reproduce, on, the, journey, and, successive, generations, continue, the, migration, some, mammals, undertake, exceptional, migrations, reindeer, have, one, of, the, longest, terrestrial, migrations, on, the, planet, reaching, as, much, as, 4, 868, kilometres, 3, 025, mi, per, year, in, north, america, however, over, the, course, of, a, year, grey, wolves, move, the, most, one, grey, wolf, covered, a, total, cumulative, annual, distance, of, 7, 247, kilometres, 4, 503, mi, mass, migration, occurs, in, mammals, such, as, the, serengeti, great, migration, an, annual, circular, pattern, of, movement, with, some, 1, 7, million, wildebeest, and, hundreds, of, thousands, of, other, large, game, animals, including, gazelles, and, zebra, more, than, 20, such, species, engage, or, used, to, engage, in, mass, migrations, of, these, migrations, those, of, the, springbok, black, wildebeest, blesbok, scimitar, horned, oryx, and, kulan, have, ceased, long, distance, migrations, occur, in, some, bats, notably, the, mass, migration, of, the, mexican, free, tailed, bat, between, oregon, and, southern, mexico, migration, is, important, in, cetaceans, including, whales, dolphins, and, porpoises, some, species, travel, long, distances, between, their, feeding, and, their, breeding, areas, humans, are, mammals, but, human, migration, as, commonly, defined, is, when, individuals, often, permanently, change, where, they, live, which, does, not, fit, the, patterns, described, here, an, exception, is, some, traditional, migratory, patterns, such, as, transhumance, in, which, herders, and, their, animals, move, seasonally, between, mountains, and, valleys, and, the, seasonal, movements, of, nomads, among, the, reptiles, adult, sea, turtles, migrate, long, distances, to, breed, as, do, some, amphibians, hatchling, sea, turtles, too, emerge, from, underground, nests, crawl, down, to, the, water, and, swim, offshore, to, reach, the, open, sea, juvenile, green, sea, turtles, make, use, of, earth, s, magnetic, field, to, navigate, some, crustaceans, migrate, such, as, the, largely, terrestrial, christmas, island, red, crab, which, moves, en, masse, each, year, by, the, millions, like, other, crabs, they, breathe, using, gills, which, must, remain, wet, so, they, avoid, direct, sunlight, digging, burrows, to, shelter, from, the, sun, they, mate, on, land, near, their, burrows, the, females, incubate, their, eggs, in, their, abdominal, brood, pouches, for, two, weeks, then, they, return, to, the, sea, to, release, their, eggs, at, high, tide, in, the, moon, s, last, quarter, the, larvae, spend, a, few, weeks, at, sea, and, then, return, to, land, scientists, gather, observations, of, animal, migration, by, tracking, their, movements, animals, were, traditionally, tracked, with, identification, tags, such, as, bird, rings, for, later, recovery, however, no, information, was, obtained, about, the, actual, route, followed, between, release, and, recovery, and, only, a, fraction, of, tagged, individuals, were, recovered, more, convenient, therefore, are, electronic, devices, such, as, radio, tracking, collars, that, can, be, followed, by, radio, whether, handheld, in, a, vehicle, or, aircraft, or, by, satellite, gps, animal, tracking, enables, accurate, positions, to, be, broadcast, at, regular, intervals, but, the, devices, are, inevitably, heavier, and, more, expensive, than, those, without, gps, an, alternative, is, the, argos, doppler, tag, also, called, a, platform, transmitter, terminal, ptt, which, sends, regularly, to, the, polar, orbiting, argos, satellites, using, doppler, shift, the, animal, s, location, can, be, estimated, relatively, roughly, compared, to, gps, but, at, a, lower, cost, and, weight, a, technology, suitable, for, small, birds, which, cannot, carry, the, heavier, devices, is, the, geolocator, which, logs, the, light, level, as, the, bird, flies, for, analysis, on, recapture, there, is, scope, for, further, development, of, systems, able, to, track, small, animals, globally, radio, tracking, tags, can, be, fitted, to, insects, including, dragonflies, and, bees, before, animal, migration, was, understood, various, folklore, and, erroneous, explanations, were, formulated, to, account, for, the, disappearance, or, sudden, arrival, of, birds, in, an, area, in, ancient, greece, aristotle, proposed, that, robins, turned, into, redstarts, when, summer, arrived, the, barnacle, goose, was, explained, in, european, medieval, bestiaries, and, manuscripts, as, either, growing, like, fruit, on, trees, or, developing, from, goose, barnacles, on, pieces, of, driftwood, another, example, is, the, swallow, which, was, once, thought, even, by, naturalists, such, as, gilbert, white, to, hibernate, either, underwater, buried, in, muddy, riverbanks, or, in, hollow, trees
