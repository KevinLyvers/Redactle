a, model, organism, is, a, non, human, species, that, is, extensively, studied, to, understand, particular, biological, phenomena, with, the, expectation, that, discoveries, made, in, the, model, organism, will, provide, insight, into, the, workings, of, other, organisms, model, organisms, are, widely, used, to, research, human, disease, when, human, experimentation, would, be, unfeasible, or, unethical, this, strategy, is, made, possible, by, the, common, descent, of, all, living, organisms, and, the, conservation, of, metabolic, and, developmental, pathways, and, genetic, material, over, the, course, of, evolution, research, using, animal, models, has, been, central, to, most, of, the, achievements, of, modern, medicine, it, has, contributed, most, of, the, basic, knowledge, in, fields, such, as, human, physiology, and, biochemistry, and, has, played, significant, roles, in, fields, such, as, neuroscience, and, infectious, disease, the, results, have, included, the, near, eradication, of, polio, and, the, development, of, organ, transplantation, and, have, benefited, both, humans, and, animals, from, 1910, to, 1927, thomas, hunt, morgan, s, work, with, the, fruit, fly, drosophila, melanogaster, identified, chromosomes, as, the, vector, of, inheritance, for, genes, and, eric, kandel, wrote, that, morgan, s, discoveries, helped, transform, biology, into, an, experimental, science, research, in, model, organisms, led, to, further, medical, advances, such, as, the, production, of, the, diphtheria, antitoxin, and, the, 1922, discovery, of, insulin, and, its, use, in, treating, diabetes, which, had, previously, meant, death, modern, general, anaesthetics, such, as, halothane, were, also, developed, through, studies, on, model, organisms, and, are, necessary, for, modern, complex, surgical, operations, other, 20th, century, medical, advances, and, treatments, that, relied, on, research, performed, in, animals, include, organ, transplant, techniques, the, heart, lung, machine, antibiotics, and, the, whooping, cough, vaccine, in, researching, human, disease, model, organisms, allow, for, better, understanding, the, disease, process, without, the, added, risk, of, harming, an, actual, human, the, species, of, the, model, organism, is, usually, chosen, so, that, it, reacts, to, disease, or, its, treatment, in, a, way, that, resembles, human, physiology, even, though, care, must, be, taken, when, generalizing, from, one, organism, to, another, however, many, drugs, treatments, and, cures, for, human, diseases, are, developed, in, part, with, the, guidance, of, animal, models, treatments, for, animal, diseases, have, also, been, developed, including, for, rabies, anthrax, glanders, feline, immunodeficiency, virus, fiv, tuberculosis, texas, cattle, fever, classical, swine, fever, hog, cholera, heartworm, and, other, parasitic, infections, animal, experimentation, continues, to, be, required, for, biomedical, research, and, is, used, with, the, aim, of, solving, medical, problems, such, as, alzheimer, s, disease, aids, multiple, sclerosis, spinal, cord, injury, many, headaches, and, other, conditions, in, which, there, is, no, useful, in, vitro, model, system, available, model, organisms, are, drawn, from, all, three, domains, of, life, as, well, as, viruses, one, of, the, first, model, systems, for, molecular, biology, was, the, bacterium, escherichia, coli, e, coli, a, common, constituent, of, the, human, digestive, system, the, mouse, mus, musculus, has, been, used, extensively, as, a, model, organism, and, is, associated, with, many, important, biological, discoveries, of, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, other, examples, include, baker, s, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, the, t4, phage, virus, the, fruit, fly, drosophila, melanogaster, the, flowering, plant, arabidopsis, thaliana, and, guinea, pigs, cavia, porcellus, several, of, the, bacterial, viruses, bacteriophage, that, infect, e, coli, also, have, been, very, useful, for, the, study, of, gene, structure, and, gene, regulation, e, g, phages, lambda, and, t4, disease, models, are, divided, into, three, categories, homologous, animals, have, the, same, causes, symptoms, and, treatment, options, as, would, humans, who, have, the, same, disease, isomorphic, animals, share, the, same, symptoms, and, treatments, and, predictive, models, are, similar, to, a, particular, human, disease, in, only, a, couple, of, aspects, but, are, useful, in, isolating, and, making, predictions, about, mechanisms, of, a, set, of, disease, features, the, use, of, animals, in, research, dates, back, to, ancient, greece, with, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, and, erasistratus, 304, 258, bce, among, the, first, to, perform, experiments, on, living, animals, discoveries, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, included, antoine, lavoisier, s, use, of, a, guinea, pig, in, a, calorimeter, to, prove, that, respiration, was, a, form, of, combustion, and, louis, pasteur, s, demonstration, of, the, germ, theory, of, disease, in, the, 1880s, using, anthrax, in, sheep, research, using, animal, models, has, been, central, to, most, of, the, achievements, of, modern, medicine, it, has, contributed, most, of, the, basic, knowledge, in, fields, such, as, human, physiology, and, biochemistry, and, has, played, significant, roles, in, fields, such, as, neuroscience, and, infectious, disease, for, example, the, results, have, included, the, near, eradication, of, polio, and, the, development, of, organ, transplantation, and, have, benefited, both, humans, and, animals, from, 1910, to, 1927, thomas, hunt, morgan, s, work, with, the, fruit, fly, drosophila, melanogaster, identified, chromosomes, as, the, vector, of, inheritance, for, genes, drosophila, became, one, of, the, first, and, for, some, time, the, most, widely, used, model, organisms, and, eric, kandel, wrote, that, morgan, s, discoveries, helped, transform, biology, into, an, experimental, science, d, melanogaster, remains, one, of, the, most, widely, used, eukaryotic, model, organisms, during, the, same, time, period, studies, on, mouse, genetics, in, the, laboratory, of, william, ernest, castle, in, collaboration, with, abbie, lathrop, led, to, generation, of, the, dba, dilute, brown, and, non, agouti, inbred, mouse, strain, and, the, systematic, generation, of, other, inbred, strains, the, mouse, has, since, been, used, extensively, as, a, model, organism, and, is, associated, with, many, important, biological, discoveries, of, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, in, the, late, 19th, century, emil, von, behring, isolated, the, diphtheria, toxin, and, demonstrated, its, effects, in, guinea, pigs, he, went, on, to, develop, an, antitoxin, against, diphtheria, in, animals, and, then, in, humans, which, resulted, in, the, modern, methods, of, immunization, and, largely, ended, diphtheria, as, a, threatening, disease, the, diphtheria, antitoxin, is, famously, commemorated, in, the, iditarod, race, which, is, modeled, after, the, delivery, of, antitoxin, in, the, 1925, serum, run, to, nome, the, success, of, animal, studies, in, producing, the, diphtheria, antitoxin, has, also, been, attributed, as, a, cause, for, the, decline, of, the, early, 20th, century, opposition, to, animal, research, in, the, united, states, subsequent, research, in, model, organisms, led, to, further, medical, advances, such, as, frederick, banting, s, research, in, dogs, which, determined, that, the, isolates, of, pancreatic, secretion, could, be, used, to, treat, dogs, with, diabetes, this, led, to, the, 1922, discovery, of, insulin, with, john, macleod, and, its, use, in, treating, diabetes, which, had, previously, meant, death, john, cade, s, research, in, guinea, pigs, discovered, the, anticonvulsant, properties, of, lithium, salts, which, revolutionized, the, treatment, of, bipolar, disorder, replacing, the, previous, treatments, of, lobotomy, or, electroconvulsive, therapy, modern, general, anaesthetics, such, as, halothane, and, related, compounds, were, also, developed, through, studies, on, model, organisms, and, are, necessary, for, modern, complex, surgical, operations, in, the, 1940s, jonas, salk, used, rhesus, monkey, studies, to, isolate, the, most, virulent, forms, of, the, polio, virus, which, led, to, his, creation, of, a, polio, vaccine, the, vaccine, which, was, made, publicly, available, in, 1955, reduced, the, incidence, of, polio, 15, fold, in, the, united, states, over, the, following, five, years, albert, sabin, improved, the, vaccine, by, passing, the, polio, virus, through, animal, hosts, including, monkeys, the, sabin, vaccine, was, produced, for, mass, consumption, in, 1963, and, had, virtually, eradicated, polio, in, the, united, states, by, 1965, it, has, been, estimated, that, developing, and, producing, the, vaccines, required, the, use, of, 100, 000, rhesus, monkeys, with, 65, doses, of, vaccine, produced, from, each, monkey, sabin, wrote, in, 1992, without, the, use, of, animals, and, human, beings, it, would, have, been, impossible, to, acquire, the, important, knowledge, needed, to, prevent, much, suffering, and, premature, death, not, only, among, humans, but, also, among, animals, other, 20th, century, medical, advances, and, treatments, that, relied, on, research, performed, in, animals, include, organ, transplant, techniques, the, heart, lung, machine, antibiotics, and, the, whooping, cough, vaccine, treatments, for, animal, diseases, have, also, been, developed, including, for, rabies, anthrax, glanders, feline, immunodeficiency, virus, fiv, tuberculosis, texas, cattle, fever, classical, swine, fever, hog, cholera, heartworm, and, other, parasitic, infections, animal, experimentation, continues, to, be, required, for, biomedical, research, and, is, used, with, the, aim, of, solving, medical, problems, such, as, alzheimer, s, disease, aids, multiple, sclerosis, spinal, cord, injury, many, headaches, and, other, conditions, in, which, there, is, no, useful, in, vitro, model, system, available, models, are, those, organisms, with, a, wealth, of, biological, data, that, make, them, attractive, to, study, as, examples, for, other, species, and, or, natural, phenomena, that, are, more, difficult, to, study, directly, continual, research, on, these, organisms, focuses, on, a, wide, variety, of, experimental, techniques, and, goals, from, many, different, levels, of, biology, from, ecology, behavior, and, biomechanics, down, to, the, tiny, functional, scale, of, individual, tissues, organelles, and, proteins, inquiries, about, the, dna, of, organisms, are, classed, as, genetic, models, with, short, generation, times, such, as, the, fruitfly, and, nematode, worm, experimental, models, and, genomic, parsimony, models, investigating, pivotal, position, in, the, evolutionary, tree, historically, model, organisms, include, a, handful, of, species, with, extensive, genomic, research, data, such, as, the, nih, model, organisms, often, model, organisms, are, chosen, on, the, basis, that, they, are, amenable, to, experimental, manipulation, this, usually, will, include, characteristics, such, as, short, life, cycle, techniques, for, genetic, manipulation, inbred, strains, stem, cell, lines, and, methods, of, transformation, and, non, specialist, living, requirements, sometimes, the, genome, arrangement, facilitates, the, sequencing, of, the, model, organism, s, genome, for, example, by, being, very, compact, or, having, a, low, proportion, of, junk, dna, e, g, yeast, arabidopsis, or, pufferfish, when, researchers, look, for, an, organism, to, use, in, their, studies, they, look, for, several, traits, among, these, are, size, generation, time, accessibility, manipulation, genetics, conservation, of, mechanisms, and, potential, economic, benefit, as, comparative, molecular, biology, has, become, more, common, some, researchers, have, sought, model, organisms, from, a, wider, assortment, of, lineages, on, the, tree, of, life, the, primary, reason, for, the, use, of, model, organisms, in, research, is, the, evolutionary, principle, that, all, organisms, share, some, degree, of, relatedness, and, genetic, similarity, due, to, common, ancestry, the, study, of, taxonomic, human, relatives, then, can, provide, a, great, deal, of, information, about, mechanism, and, disease, within, the, human, body, that, can, be, useful, in, medicine, various, phylogenetic, trees, for, vertebrates, have, been, constructed, using, comparative, proteomics, genetics, genomics, as, well, as, the, geochemical, and, fossil, record, these, estimations, tell, us, that, humans, and, chimpanzees, last, shared, a, common, ancestor, about, 6, million, years, ago, mya, as, our, closest, relatives, chimpanzees, have, a, lot, of, potential, to, tell, us, about, mechanisms, of, disease, and, what, genes, may, be, responsible, for, human, intelligence, however, chimpanzees, are, rarely, used, in, research, and, are, protected, from, highly, invasive, procedures, rodents, are, the, most, common, animal, models, phylogenetic, trees, estimate, that, humans, and, rodents, last, shared, a, common, ancestor, 80, 100mya, despite, this, distant, split, humans, and, rodents, have, far, more, similarities, than, they, do, differences, this, is, due, to, the, relative, stability, of, large, portions, of, the, genome, making, the, use, of, vertebrate, animals, particularly, productive, genomic, data, is, used, to, make, close, comparisons, between, species, and, determine, relatedness, humans, share, about, 99, of, their, genome, with, chimpanzees, 98, 7, with, bonobos, and, over, 90, with, the, mouse, with, so, much, of, the, genome, conserved, across, species, it, is, relatively, impressive, that, the, differences, between, humans, and, mice, can, be, accounted, for, in, approximately, six, thousand, genes, of, 30, 000, total, scientists, have, been, able, to, take, advantage, of, these, similarities, in, generating, experimental, and, predictive, models, of, human, disease, there, are, many, model, organisms, one, of, the, first, model, systems, for, molecular, biology, was, the, bacterium, escherichia, coli, a, common, constituent, of, the, human, digestive, system, several, of, the, bacterial, viruses, bacteriophage, that, infect, e, coli, also, have, been, very, useful, for, the, study, of, gene, structure, and, gene, regulation, e, g, phages, lambda, and, t4, however, it, is, debated, whether, bacteriophages, should, be, classified, as, organisms, because, they, lack, metabolism, and, depend, on, functions, of, the, host, cells, for, propagation, in, eukaryotes, several, yeasts, particularly, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, baker, s, or, budding, yeast, have, been, widely, used, in, genetics, and, cell, biology, largely, because, they, are, quick, and, easy, to, grow, the, cell, cycle, in, a, simple, yeast, is, very, similar, to, the, cell, cycle, in, humans, and, is, regulated, by, homologous, proteins, the, fruit, fly, drosophila, melanogaster, is, studied, again, because, it, is, easy, to, grow, for, an, animal, has, various, visible, congenital, traits, and, has, a, polytene, giant, chromosome, in, its, salivary, glands, that, can, be, examined, under, a, light, microscope, the, roundworm, caenorhabditis, elegans, is, studied, because, it, has, very, defined, development, patterns, involving, fixed, numbers, of, cells, and, it, can, be, rapidly, assayed, for, abnormalities, animal, models, serving, in, research, may, have, an, existing, inbred, or, induced, disease, or, injury, that, is, similar, to, a, human, condition, these, test, conditions, are, often, termed, as, animal, models, of, disease, the, use, of, animal, models, allows, researchers, to, investigate, disease, states, in, ways, which, would, be, inaccessible, in, a, human, patient, performing, procedures, on, the, non, human, animal, that, imply, a, level, of, harm, that, would, not, be, considered, ethical, to, inflict, on, a, human, the, best, models, of, disease, are, similar, in, etiology, mechanism, of, cause, and, phenotype, signs, and, symptoms, to, the, human, equivalent, however, complex, human, diseases, can, often, be, better, understood, in, a, simplified, system, in, which, individual, parts, of, the, disease, process, are, isolated, and, examined, for, instance, behavioral, analogues, of, anxiety, or, pain, in, laboratory, animals, can, be, used, to, screen, and, test, new, drugs, for, the, treatment, of, these, conditions, in, humans, a, 2000, study, found, that, animal, models, concorded, coincided, on, true, positives, and, false, negatives, with, human, toxicity, in, 71, of, cases, with, 63, for, nonrodents, alone, and, 43, for, rodents, alone, in, 1987, davidson, et, al, suggested, that, selection, of, an, animal, model, for, research, be, based, on, nine, considerations, these, include, 1, appropriateness, as, an, analog, 2, transferability, of, information, 3, genetic, uniformity, of, organisms, where, applicable, 4, background, knowledge, of, biological, properties, 5, cost, and, availability, 6, generalizability, of, the, results, 7, ease, of, and, adaptability, to, experimental, manipulation, 8, ecological, consequences, and, 9, ethical, implications, animal, models, can, be, classified, as, homologous, isomorphic, or, predictive, animal, models, can, also, be, more, broadly, classified, into, four, categories, 1, experimental, 2, spontaneous, 3, negative, 4, orphan, experimental, models, are, most, common, these, refer, to, models, of, disease, that, resemble, human, conditions, in, phenotype, or, response, to, treatment, but, are, induced, artificially, in, the, laboratory, some, examples, include, spontaneous, models, refer, to, diseases, that, are, analogous, to, human, conditions, that, occur, naturally, in, the, animal, being, studied, these, models, are, rare, but, informative, negative, models, essentially, refer, to, control, animals, which, are, useful, for, validating, an, experimental, result, orphan, models, refer, to, diseases, for, which, there, is, no, human, analog, and, occur, exclusively, in, the, species, studied, the, increase, in, knowledge, of, the, genomes, of, non, human, primates, and, other, mammals, that, are, genetically, close, to, humans, is, allowing, the, production, of, genetically, engineered, animal, tissues, organs, and, even, animal, species, which, express, human, diseases, providing, a, more, robust, model, of, human, diseases, in, an, animal, model, animal, models, observed, in, the, sciences, of, psychology, and, sociology, are, often, termed, animal, models, of, behavior, it, is, difficult, to, build, an, animal, model, that, perfectly, reproduces, the, symptoms, of, depression, in, patients, depression, as, other, mental, disorders, consists, of, endophenotypes, that, can, be, reproduced, independently, and, evaluated, in, animals, an, ideal, animal, model, offers, an, opportunity, to, understand, molecular, genetic, and, epigenetic, factors, that, may, lead, to, depression, by, using, animal, models, the, underlying, molecular, alterations, and, the, causal, relationship, between, genetic, or, environmental, alterations, and, depression, can, be, examined, which, would, afford, a, better, insight, into, pathology, of, depression, in, addition, animal, models, of, depression, are, indispensable, for, identifying, novel, therapies, for, depression, model, organisms, are, drawn, from, all, three, domains, of, life, as, well, as, viruses, the, most, widely, studied, prokaryotic, model, organism, is, escherichia, coli, e, coli, which, has, been, intensively, investigated, for, over, 60, years, it, is, a, common, gram, negative, gut, bacterium, which, can, be, grown, and, cultured, easily, and, inexpensively, in, a, laboratory, setting, it, is, the, most, widely, used, organism, in, molecular, genetics, and, is, an, important, species, in, the, fields, of, biotechnology, and, microbiology, where, it, has, served, as, the, host, organism, for, the, majority, of, work, with, recombinant, dna, simple, model, eukaryotes, include, baker, s, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, and, fission, yeast, schizosaccharomyces, pombe, both, of, which, share, many, characters, with, higher, cells, including, those, of, humans, for, instance, many, cell, division, genes, that, are, critical, for, the, development, of, cancer, have, been, discovered, in, yeast, chlamydomonas, reinhardtii, a, unicellular, green, alga, with, well, studied, genetics, is, used, to, study, photosynthesis, and, motility, c, reinhardtii, has, many, known, and, mapped, mutants, and, expressed, sequence, tags, and, there, are, advanced, methods, for, genetic, transformation, and, selection, of, genes, dictyostelium, discoideum, is, used, in, molecular, biology, and, genetics, and, is, studied, as, an, example, of, cell, communication, differentiation, and, programmed, cell, death, among, invertebrates, the, fruit, fly, drosophila, melanogaster, is, famous, as, the, subject, of, genetics, experiments, by, thomas, hunt, morgan, and, others, they, are, easily, raised, in, the, lab, with, rapid, generations, high, fecundity, few, chromosomes, and, easily, induced, observable, mutations, the, nematode, caenorhabditis, elegans, is, used, for, understanding, the, genetic, control, of, development, and, physiology, it, was, first, proposed, as, a, model, for, neuronal, development, by, sydney, brenner, in, 1963, and, has, been, extensively, used, in, many, different, contexts, since, then, c, elegans, was, the, first, multicellular, organism, whose, genome, was, completely, sequenced, and, as, of, 2012, the, only, organism, to, have, its, connectome, neuronal, wiring, diagram, completed, arabidopsis, thaliana, is, currently, the, most, popular, model, plant, its, small, stature, and, short, generation, time, facilitates, rapid, genetic, studies, and, many, phenotypic, and, biochemical, mutants, have, been, mapped, a, thaliana, was, the, first, plant, to, have, its, genome, sequenced, among, vertebrates, guinea, pigs, cavia, porcellus, were, used, by, robert, koch, and, other, early, bacteriologists, as, a, host, for, bacterial, infections, becoming, a, byword, for, laboratory, animal, but, are, less, commonly, used, today, the, classic, model, vertebrate, is, currently, the, mouse, mus, musculus, many, inbred, strains, exist, as, well, as, lines, selected, for, particular, traits, often, of, medical, interest, e, g, body, size, obesity, muscularity, and, voluntary, wheel, running, behavior, the, rat, rattus, norvegicus, is, particularly, useful, as, a, toxicology, model, and, as, a, neurological, model, and, source, of, primary, cell, cultures, owing, to, the, larger, size, of, organs, and, suborganellar, structures, relative, to, the, mouse, while, eggs, and, embryos, from, xenopus, tropicalis, and, xenopus, laevis, african, clawed, frog, are, used, in, developmental, biology, cell, biology, toxicology, and, neuroscience, likewise, the, zebrafish, danio, rerio, has, a, nearly, transparent, body, during, early, development, which, provides, unique, visual, access, to, the, animal, s, internal, anatomy, during, this, time, period, zebrafish, are, used, to, study, development, toxicology, and, toxicopathology, specific, gene, function, and, roles, of, signaling, pathways, other, important, model, organisms, and, some, of, their, uses, include, t4, phage, viral, infection, tetrahymena, thermophila, intracellular, processes, maize, transposons, hydras, regeneration, and, morphogenesis, cats, neurophysiology, chickens, development, dogs, respiratory, and, cardiovascular, systems, nothobranchius, furzeri, aging, non, human, primates, such, as, the, rhesus, macaque, and, chimpanzee, hepatitis, hiv, parkinson, s, disease, cognition, and, vaccines, and, ferrets, sars, cov, 2, the, organisms, below, have, become, model, organisms, because, they, facilitate, the, study, of, certain, characters, or, because, of, their, genetic, accessibility, for, example, e, coli, was, one, of, the, first, organisms, for, which, genetic, techniques, such, as, transformation, or, genetic, manipulation, has, been, developed, the, genomes, of, all, model, species, have, been, sequenced, including, their, mitochondrial, chloroplast, genomes, model, organism, databases, exist, to, provide, researchers, with, a, portal, from, which, to, download, sequences, dna, rna, or, protein, or, to, access, functional, information, on, specific, genes, for, example, the, sub, cellular, localization, of, the, gene, product, or, its, physiological, role, many, animal, models, serving, as, test, subjects, in, biomedical, research, such, as, rats, and, mice, may, be, selectively, sedentary, obese, and, glucose, intolerant, this, may, confound, their, use, to, model, human, metabolic, processes, and, diseases, as, these, can, be, affected, by, dietary, energy, intake, and, exercise, similarly, there, are, differences, between, the, immune, systems, of, model, organisms, and, humans, that, lead, to, significantly, altered, responses, to, stimuli, although, the, underlying, principles, of, genome, function, may, be, the, same, the, impoverished, environments, inside, standard, laboratory, cages, deny, research, animals, of, the, mental, and, physical, challenges, are, necessary, for, healthy, emotional, development, without, day, to, day, variety, risks, and, rewards, and, complex, environments, some, have, argued, that, animal, models, are, irrelevant, models, of, human, experience, mice, differ, from, humans, in, several, immune, properties, mice, are, more, resistant, to, some, toxins, than, humans, have, a, lower, total, neutrophil, fraction, in, the, blood, a, lower, neutrophil, enzymatic, capacity, lower, activity, of, the, complement, system, and, a, different, set, of, pentraxins, involved, in, the, inflammatory, process, and, lack, genes, for, important, components, of, the, immune, system, such, as, il, 8, il, 37, tlr10, icam, 3, etc, laboratory, mice, reared, in, specific, pathogen, free, spf, conditions, usually, have, a, rather, immature, immune, system, with, a, deficit, of, memory, t, cells, these, mice, may, have, limited, diversity, of, the, microbiota, which, directly, affects, the, immune, system, and, the, development, of, pathological, conditions, moreover, persistent, virus, infections, for, example, herpesviruses, are, activated, in, humans, but, not, in, spf, mice, with, septic, complications, and, may, change, the, resistance, to, bacterial, coinfections, dirty, mice, are, possibly, better, suitable, for, mimicking, human, pathologies, in, addition, inbred, mouse, strains, are, used, in, the, overwhelming, majority, of, studies, while, the, human, population, is, heterogeneous, pointing, to, the, importance, of, studies, in, interstrain, hybrid, outbred, and, nonlinear, mice, some, studies, suggests, that, inadequate, published, data, in, animal, testing, may, result, in, irreproducible, research, with, missing, details, about, how, experiments, are, done, omitted, from, published, papers, or, differences, in, testing, that, may, introduce, bias, examples, of, hidden, bias, include, a, 2014, study, from, mcgill, university, in, montreal, canada, which, suggests, that, mice, handled, by, men, rather, than, women, showed, higher, stress, levels, another, study, in, 2016, suggested, that, gut, microbiomes, in, mice, may, have, an, impact, upon, scientific, research, ethical, concerns, as, well, as, the, cost, maintenance, and, relative, inefficiency, of, animal, research, has, encouraged, development, of, alternative, methods, for, the, study, of, disease, cell, culture, or, in, vitro, studies, provide, an, alternative, that, preserves, the, physiology, of, the, living, cell, but, does, not, require, the, sacrifice, of, an, animal, for, mechanistic, studies, human, inducible, pluripotent, stem, cells, can, also, elucidate, new, mechanisms, for, understanding, cancer, and, cell, regeneration, imaging, studies, such, as, mri, or, pet, scans, enable, non, invasive, study, of, human, subjects, recent, advances, in, genetics, and, genomics, can, identify, disease, associated, genes, which, can, be, targeted, for, therapies, many, biomedical, researchers, argue, that, there, is, no, substitute, for, a, living, organism, when, studying, complex, interactions, in, disease, pathology, or, treatments, debate, about, the, ethical, use, of, animals, in, research, dates, at, least, as, far, back, as, 1822, when, the, british, parliament, under, pressure, from, british, and, indian, intellectuals, enacted, the, first, law, for, animal, protection, preventing, cruelty, to, cattle, this, was, followed, by, the, cruelty, to, animals, act, of, 1835, and, 1849, which, criminalized, ill, treating, over, driving, and, torturing, animals, in, 1876, under, pressure, from, the, national, anti, vivisection, society, the, cruelty, to, animals, act, was, amended, to, include, regulations, governing, the, use, of, animals, in, research, this, new, act, stipulated, that, 1, experiments, must, be, proven, absolutely, necessary, for, instruction, or, to, save, or, prolong, human, life, 2, animals, must, be, properly, anesthetized, and, 3, animals, must, be, killed, as, soon, as, the, experiment, is, over, today, these, three, principles, are, central, to, the, laws, and, guidelines, governing, the, use, of, animals, and, research, in, the, u, s, the, animal, welfare, act, of, 1970, see, also, laboratory, animal, welfare, act, set, standards, for, animal, use, and, care, in, research, this, law, is, enforced, by, aphis, s, animal, care, program, in, academic, settings, in, which, nih, funding, is, used, for, animal, research, institutions, are, governed, by, the, nih, office, of, laboratory, animal, welfare, olaw, at, each, site, olaw, guidelines, and, standards, are, upheld, by, a, local, review, board, called, the, institutional, animal, care, and, use, committee, iacuc, all, laboratory, experiments, involving, living, animals, are, reviewed, and, approved, by, this, committee, in, addition, to, proving, the, potential, for, benefit, to, human, health, minimization, of, pain, and, distress, and, timely, and, humane, euthanasia, experimenters, must, justify, their, protocols, based, on, the, principles, of, replacement, reduction, and, refinement, replacement, refers, to, efforts, to, engage, alternatives, to, animal, use, this, includes, the, use, of, computer, models, non, living, tissues, and, cells, and, replacement, of, higher, order, animals, primates, and, mammals, with, lower, order, animals, e, g, cold, blooded, animals, invertebrates, wherever, possible, reduction, refers, to, efforts, to, minimize, number, of, animals, used, during, the, course, of, an, experiment, as, well, as, prevention, of, unnecessary, replication, of, previous, experiments, to, satisfy, this, requirement, mathematical, calculations, of, statistical, power, are, employed, to, determine, the, minimum, number, of, animals, that, can, be, used, to, get, a, statistically, significant, experimental, result, refinement, refers, to, efforts, to, make, experimental, design, as, painless, and, efficient, as, possible, in, order, to, minimize, the, suffering, of, each, animal, subject
