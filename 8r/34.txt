a, sense, is, a, biological, system, used, by, an, organism, for, sensation, the, process, of, gathering, information, about, the, surroundings, through, the, detection, of, stimuli, although, in, some, cultures, five, human, senses, were, traditionally, identified, as, such, namely, sight, smell, touch, taste, and, hearing, many, more, are, now, recognized, senses, used, by, non, human, organisms, are, even, greater, in, variety, and, number, during, sensation, sense, organs, collect, various, stimuli, such, as, a, sound, or, smell, for, transduction, meaning, transformation, into, a, form, that, can, be, understood, by, the, brain, sensation, and, perception, are, fundamental, to, nearly, every, aspect, of, an, organism, s, cognition, behavior, and, thought, in, organisms, a, sensory, organ, consists, of, a, group, of, interrelated, sensory, cells, that, respond, to, a, specific, type, of, physical, stimulus, via, cranial, and, spinal, nerves, nerves, of, the, central, and, peripheral, nervous, systems, that, relay, sensory, information, to, and, from, the, brain, and, body, the, different, types, of, sensory, receptor, cells, such, as, mechanoreceptors, photoreceptors, chemoreceptors, thermoreceptors, in, sensory, organs, transduct, sensory, information, from, these, organs, towards, the, central, nervous, system, finally, arriving, at, the, sensory, cortices, in, the, brain, where, sensory, signals, are, processed, and, interpreted, perceived, sensory, systems, or, senses, are, often, divided, into, external, exteroception, and, internal, interoception, sensory, systems, human, external, senses, are, based, on, the, sensory, organs, of, the, eyes, ears, skin, nose, mouth, and, the, vestibular, system, internal, sensation, detects, stimuli, from, internal, organs, and, tissues, internal, senses, possessed, by, humans, include, spatial, orientation, proprioception, body, position, and, nociception, pain, further, internal, senses, lead, to, signals, such, as, hunger, thirst, suffocation, and, nausea, or, different, involuntary, behaviors, such, as, vomiting, some, animals, are, able, to, detect, electrical, and, magnetic, fields, air, moisture, or, polarized, light, while, others, sense, and, perceive, through, alternative, systems, such, as, echolocation, sensory, modalities, or, sub, modalities, are, different, ways, sensory, information, is, encoded, or, transduced, multimodality, integrates, different, senses, into, one, unified, perceptual, experience, for, example, information, from, one, sense, has, the, potential, to, influence, how, information, from, another, is, perceived, sensation, and, perception, are, studied, by, a, variety, of, related, fields, most, notably, psychophysics, neurobiology, cognitive, psychology, and, cognitive, science, sensory, organs, are, organs, that, sense, and, transduce, stimuli, humans, have, various, sensory, organs, i, e, eyes, ears, skin, nose, and, mouth, that, correspond, to, a, respective, visual, system, sense, of, vision, auditory, system, sense, of, hearing, somatosensory, system, sense, of, touch, olfactory, system, sense, of, smell, and, gustatory, system, sense, of, taste, those, systems, in, turn, contribute, to, vision, hearing, touch, smell, and, the, ability, to, taste, internal, sensation, or, interoception, detects, stimuli, from, internal, organs, and, tissues, many, internal, sensory, and, perceptual, systems, exist, in, humans, including, the, vestibular, system, sense, of, balance, sensed, by, the, inner, ear, and, providing, the, perception, of, spatial, orientation, proprioception, body, position, and, nociception, pain, further, internal, chemoreception, and, osmoreception, based, sensory, systems, lead, to, various, perceptions, such, as, hunger, thirst, suffocation, and, nausea, or, different, involuntary, behaviors, such, as, vomiting, nonhuman, animals, experience, sensation, and, perception, with, varying, levels, of, similarity, to, and, difference, from, humans, and, other, animal, species, for, example, other, mammals, in, general, have, a, stronger, sense, of, smell, than, humans, some, animal, species, lack, one, or, more, human, sensory, system, analogues, and, some, have, sensory, systems, that, are, not, found, in, humans, while, others, process, and, interpret, the, same, sensory, information, in, very, different, ways, for, example, some, animals, are, able, to, detect, electrical, fields, and, magnetic, fields, air, moisture, or, polarized, light, others, sense, and, perceive, through, alternative, systems, such, as, echolocation, recent, theory, suggests, that, plants, and, artificial, agents, such, as, robots, may, be, able, to, detect, and, interpret, environmental, information, in, an, analogous, manner, to, animals, sensory, modality, refers, to, the, way, that, information, is, encoded, which, is, similar, to, the, idea, of, transduction, the, main, sensory, modalities, can, be, described, on, the, basis, of, how, each, is, transduced, listing, all, the, different, sensory, modalities, which, can, number, as, many, as, 17, involves, separating, the, major, senses, into, more, specific, categories, or, submodalities, of, the, larger, sense, an, individual, sensory, modality, represents, the, sensation, of, a, specific, type, of, stimulus, for, example, the, general, sensation, and, perception, of, touch, which, is, known, as, somatosensation, can, be, separated, into, light, pressure, deep, pressure, vibration, itch, pain, temperature, or, hair, movement, while, the, general, sensation, and, perception, of, taste, can, be, separated, into, submodalities, of, sweet, salty, sour, bitter, spicy, and, umami, all, of, which, are, based, on, different, chemicals, binding, to, sensory, neurons, sensory, receptors, are, the, cells, or, structures, that, detect, sensations, stimuli, in, the, environment, activate, specialized, receptor, cells, in, the, peripheral, nervous, system, during, transduction, physical, stimulus, is, converted, into, action, potential, by, receptors, and, transmitted, towards, the, central, nervous, system, for, processing, different, types, of, stimuli, are, sensed, by, different, types, of, receptor, cells, receptor, cells, can, be, classified, into, types, on, the, basis, of, three, different, criteria, cell, type, position, and, function, receptors, can, be, classified, structurally, on, the, basis, of, cell, type, and, their, position, in, relation, to, stimuli, they, sense, receptors, can, further, be, classified, functionally, on, the, basis, of, the, transduction, of, stimuli, or, how, the, mechanical, stimulus, light, or, chemical, changed, the, cell, membrane, potential, one, way, to, classify, receptors, is, based, on, their, location, relative, to, the, stimuli, an, exteroceptor, is, a, receptor, that, is, located, near, a, stimulus, of, the, external, environment, such, as, the, somatosensory, receptors, that, are, located, in, the, skin, an, interoceptor, is, one, that, interprets, stimuli, from, internal, organs, and, tissues, such, as, the, receptors, that, sense, the, increase, in, blood, pressure, in, the, aorta, or, carotid, sinus, the, cells, that, interpret, information, about, the, environment, can, be, either, 1, a, neuron, that, has, a, free, nerve, ending, with, dendrites, embedded, in, tissue, that, would, receive, a, sensation, 2, a, neuron, that, has, an, encapsulated, ending, in, which, the, sensory, nerve, endings, are, encapsulated, in, connective, tissue, that, enhances, their, sensitivity, or, 3, a, specialized, receptor, cell, which, has, distinct, structural, components, that, interpret, a, specific, type, of, stimulus, the, pain, and, temperature, receptors, in, the, dermis, of, the, skin, are, examples, of, neurons, that, have, free, nerve, endings, 1, also, located, in, the, dermis, of, the, skin, are, lamellated, corpuscles, neurons, with, encapsulated, nerve, endings, that, respond, to, pressure, and, touch, 2, the, cells, in, the, retina, that, respond, to, light, stimuli, are, an, example, of, a, specialized, receptor, 3, a, photoreceptor, a, transmembrane, protein, receptor, is, a, protein, in, the, cell, membrane, that, mediates, a, physiological, change, in, a, neuron, most, often, through, the, opening, of, ion, channels, or, changes, in, the, cell, signaling, processes, transmembrane, receptors, are, activated, by, chemicals, called, ligands, for, example, a, molecule, in, food, can, serve, as, a, ligand, for, taste, receptors, other, transmembrane, proteins, which, are, not, accurately, called, receptors, are, sensitive, to, mechanical, or, thermal, changes, physical, changes, in, these, proteins, increase, ion, flow, across, the, membrane, and, can, generate, an, action, potential, or, a, graded, potential, in, the, sensory, neurons, a, third, classification, of, receptors, is, by, how, the, receptor, transduces, stimuli, into, membrane, potential, changes, stimuli, are, of, three, general, types, some, stimuli, are, ions, and, macromolecules, that, affect, transmembrane, receptor, proteins, when, these, chemicals, diffuse, across, the, cell, membrane, some, stimuli, are, physical, variations, in, the, environment, that, affect, receptor, cell, membrane, potentials, other, stimuli, include, the, electromagnetic, radiation, from, visible, light, for, humans, the, only, electromagnetic, energy, that, is, perceived, by, our, eyes, is, visible, light, some, other, organisms, have, receptors, that, humans, lack, such, as, the, heat, sensors, of, snakes, the, ultraviolet, light, sensors, of, bees, or, magnetic, receptors, in, migratory, birds, receptor, cells, can, be, further, categorized, on, the, basis, of, the, type, of, stimuli, they, transduce, the, different, types, of, functional, receptor, cell, types, are, mechanoreceptors, photoreceptors, chemoreceptors, osmoreceptor, thermoreceptors, electroreceptors, in, certain, mammals, and, fish, and, nociceptors, physical, stimuli, such, as, pressure, and, vibration, as, well, as, the, sensation, of, sound, and, body, position, balance, are, interpreted, through, a, mechanoreceptor, photoreceptors, convert, light, visible, electromagnetic, radiation, into, signals, chemical, stimuli, can, be, interpreted, by, a, chemoreceptor, that, interprets, chemical, stimuli, such, as, an, object, s, taste, or, smell, while, osmoreceptors, respond, to, a, chemical, solute, concentrations, of, body, fluids, nociception, pain, interprets, the, presence, of, tissue, damage, from, sensory, information, from, mechano, chemo, and, thermoreceptors, another, physical, stimulus, that, has, its, own, type, of, receptor, is, temperature, which, is, sensed, through, a, thermoreceptor, that, is, either, sensitive, to, temperatures, above, heat, or, below, cold, normal, body, temperature, each, sense, organ, eyes, or, nose, for, instance, requires, a, minimal, amount, of, stimulation, in, order, to, detect, a, stimulus, this, minimum, amount, of, stimulus, is, called, the, absolute, threshold, the, absolute, threshold, is, defined, as, the, minimum, amount, of, stimulation, necessary, for, the, detection, of, a, stimulus, 50, of, the, time, absolute, threshold, is, measured, by, using, a, method, called, signal, detection, this, process, involves, presenting, stimuli, of, varying, intensities, to, a, subject, in, order, to, determine, the, level, at, which, the, subject, can, reliably, detect, stimulation, in, a, given, sense, differential, threshold, or, just, noticeable, difference, jds, is, the, smallest, detectable, difference, between, two, stimuli, or, the, smallest, difference, in, stimuli, that, can, be, judged, to, be, different, from, each, other, weber, s, law, is, an, empirical, law, that, states, that, the, difference, threshold, is, a, constant, fraction, of, the, comparison, stimulus, according, to, weber, s, law, bigger, stimuli, require, larger, differences, to, be, noticed, magnitude, estimation, is, a, psychophysical, method, in, which, subjects, assign, perceived, values, of, given, stimuli, the, relationship, between, stimulus, intensity, and, perceptive, intensity, is, described, by, steven, s, power, law, signal, detection, theory, quantifies, the, experience, of, the, subject, to, the, presentation, of, a, stimulus, in, the, presence, of, noise, there, is, internal, noise, and, there, is, external, noise, when, it, comes, to, signal, detection, the, internal, noise, originates, from, static, in, the, nervous, system, for, example, an, individual, with, closed, eyes, in, a, dark, room, still, sees, something, a, blotchy, pattern, of, grey, with, intermittent, brighter, flashes, this, is, internal, noise, external, noise, is, the, result, of, noise, in, the, environment, that, can, interfere, with, the, detection, of, the, stimulus, of, interest, noise, is, only, a, problem, if, the, magnitude, of, the, noise, is, large, enough, to, interfere, with, signal, collection, the, nervous, system, calculates, a, criterion, or, an, internal, threshold, for, the, detection, of, a, signal, in, the, presence, of, noise, if, a, signal, is, judged, to, be, above, the, criterion, thus, the, signal, is, differentiated, from, the, noise, the, signal, is, sensed, and, perceived, errors, in, signal, detection, can, potentially, lead, to, false, positives, and, false, negatives, the, sensory, criterion, might, be, shifted, based, on, the, importance, of, the, detecting, the, signal, shifting, of, the, criterion, may, influence, the, likelihood, of, false, positives, and, false, negatives, subjective, visual, and, auditory, experiences, appear, to, be, similar, across, humans, subjects, the, same, cannot, be, said, about, taste, for, example, there, is, a, molecule, called, propylthiouracil, prop, that, some, humans, experience, as, bitter, some, as, almost, tasteless, while, others, experience, it, as, somewhere, between, tasteless, and, bitter, there, is, a, genetic, basis, for, this, difference, between, perception, given, the, same, sensory, stimulus, this, subjective, difference, in, taste, perception, has, implications, for, individuals, food, preferences, and, consequently, health, when, a, stimulus, is, constant, and, unchanging, perceptual, sensory, adaptation, occurs, during, that, process, the, subject, becomes, less, sensitive, to, the, stimulus, biological, auditory, hearing, vestibular, and, spatial, and, visual, systems, vision, appear, to, break, down, real, world, complex, stimuli, into, sine, wave, components, through, the, mathematical, process, called, fourier, analysis, many, neurons, have, a, strong, preference, for, certain, sine, frequency, components, in, contrast, to, others, the, way, that, simpler, sounds, and, images, are, encoded, during, sensation, can, provide, insight, into, how, perception, of, real, world, objects, happens, perception, occurs, when, nerves, that, lead, from, the, sensory, organs, e, g, eye, to, the, brain, are, stimulated, even, if, that, stimulation, is, unrelated, to, the, target, signal, of, the, sensory, organ, for, example, in, the, case, of, the, eye, it, does, not, matter, whether, light, or, something, else, stimulates, the, optic, nerve, that, stimulation, will, results, in, visual, perception, even, if, there, was, no, visual, stimulus, to, begin, with, to, prove, this, point, to, yourself, and, if, you, are, a, human, close, your, eyes, preferably, in, a, dark, room, and, press, gently, on, the, outside, corner, of, one, eye, through, the, eyelid, you, will, see, a, visual, spot, toward, the, inside, of, your, visual, field, near, your, nose, all, stimuli, received, by, the, receptors, are, transduced, to, an, action, potential, which, is, carried, along, one, or, more, afferent, neurons, towards, a, specific, area, cortex, of, the, brain, just, as, different, nerves, are, dedicated, to, sensory, and, motors, tasks, different, areas, of, the, brain, cortices, are, similarly, dedicated, to, different, sensory, and, perceptual, tasks, more, complex, processing, is, accomplished, across, primary, cortical, regions, that, spread, beyond, the, primary, cortices, every, nerve, sensory, or, motor, has, its, own, signal, transmission, speed, for, example, nerves, in, the, frog, s, legs, have, a, 90, ft, s, 99, km, h, signal, transmission, speed, while, sensory, nerves, in, humans, transmit, sensory, information, at, speeds, between, 165, ft, s, 181, km, h, and, 330, ft, s, 362, km, h, perceptual, experience, is, often, multimodal, multimodality, integrates, different, senses, into, one, unified, perceptual, experience, information, from, one, sense, has, the, potential, to, influence, how, information, from, another, is, perceived, multimodal, perception, is, qualitatively, different, from, unimodal, perception, there, has, been, a, growing, body, of, evidence, since, the, mid, 1990s, on, the, neural, correlates, of, multimodal, perception, the, philosophy, of, perception, is, concerned, with, the, nature, of, perceptual, experience, and, the, status, of, perceptual, data, in, particular, how, they, relate, to, beliefs, about, or, knowledge, of, the, world, historical, inquiries, into, the, underlying, mechanisms, of, sensation, and, perception, have, led, early, researchers, to, subscribe, to, various, philosophical, interpretations, of, perception, and, the, mind, including, panpsychism, dualism, and, materialism, the, majority, of, modern, scientists, who, study, sensation, and, perception, take, on, a, materialistic, view, of, the, mind, some, examples, of, human, absolute, thresholds, for, the, nine, to, 21, external, senses, humans, respond, more, strongly, to, multimodal, stimuli, compared, to, the, sum, of, each, single, modality, together, an, effect, called, the, superadditive, effect, of, multisensory, integration, neurons, that, respond, to, both, visual, and, auditory, stimuli, have, been, identified, in, the, superior, temporal, sulcus, additionally, multimodal, what, and, where, pathways, have, been, proposed, for, auditory, and, tactile, stimuli, external, receptors, that, respond, to, stimuli, from, outside, the, body, are, called, exteroceptors, human, external, sensation, is, based, on, the, sensory, organs, of, the, eyes, ears, skin, vestibular, system, nose, and, mouth, which, contribute, respectively, to, the, sensory, perceptions, of, vision, hearing, touch, balance, smell, and, taste, smell, and, taste, are, both, responsible, for, identifying, molecules, and, thus, both, are, types, of, chemoreceptors, both, olfaction, smell, and, gustation, taste, require, the, transduction, of, chemical, stimuli, into, electrical, potentials, the, visual, system, or, sense, of, sight, is, based, on, the, transduction, of, light, stimuli, received, through, the, eyes, and, contributes, to, visual, perception, the, visual, system, detects, light, on, photoreceptors, in, the, retina, of, each, eye, that, generates, electrical, nerve, impulses, for, the, perception, of, varying, colors, and, brightness, there, are, two, types, of, photoreceptors, rods, and, cones, rods, are, very, sensitive, to, light, but, do, not, distinguish, colors, cones, distinguish, colors, but, are, less, sensitive, to, dim, light, at, the, molecular, level, visual, stimuli, cause, changes, in, the, photopigment, molecule, that, lead, to, changes, in, membrane, potential, of, the, photoreceptor, cell, a, single, unit, of, light, is, called, a, photon, which, is, described, in, physics, as, a, packet, of, energy, with, properties, of, both, a, particle, and, a, wave, the, energy, of, a, photon, is, represented, by, its, wavelength, with, each, wavelength, of, visible, light, corresponding, to, a, particular, color, visible, light, is, electromagnetic, radiation, with, a, wavelength, between, 380, and, 720, nm, wavelengths, of, electromagnetic, radiation, longer, than, 720, nm, fall, into, the, infrared, range, whereas, wavelengths, shorter, than, 380, nm, fall, into, the, ultraviolet, range, light, with, a, wavelength, of, 380, nm, is, blue, whereas, light, with, a, wavelength, of, 720, nm, is, dark, red, all, other, colors, fall, between, red, and, blue, at, various, points, along, the, wavelength, scale, the, three, types, of, cone, opsins, being, sensitive, to, different, wavelengths, of, light, provide, us, with, color, vision, by, comparing, the, activity, of, the, three, different, cones, the, brain, can, extract, color, information, from, visual, stimuli, for, example, a, bright, blue, light, that, has, a, wavelength, of, approximately, 450, nm, would, activate, the, red, cones, minimally, the, green, cones, marginally, and, the, blue, cones, predominantly, the, relative, activation, of, the, three, different, cones, is, calculated, by, the, brain, which, perceives, the, color, as, blue, however, cones, cannot, react, to, low, intensity, light, and, rods, do, not, sense, the, color, of, light, therefore, our, low, light, vision, is, in, essence, in, grayscale, in, other, words, in, a, dark, room, everything, appears, as, a, shade, of, gray, if, you, think, that, you, can, see, colors, in, the, dark, it, is, most, likely, because, your, brain, knows, what, color, something, is, and, is, relying, on, that, memory, there, is, some, disagreement, as, to, whether, the, visual, system, consists, of, one, two, or, three, submodalities, neuroanatomists, generally, regard, it, as, two, submodalities, given, that, different, receptors, are, responsible, for, the, perception, of, color, and, brightness, some, argue, that, stereopsis, the, perception, of, depth, using, both, eyes, also, constitutes, a, sense, but, it, is, generally, regarded, as, a, cognitive, that, is, post, sensory, function, of, the, visual, cortex, of, the, brain, where, patterns, and, objects, in, images, are, recognized, and, interpreted, based, on, previously, learned, information, this, is, called, visual, memory, the, inability, to, see, is, called, blindness, blindness, may, result, from, damage, to, the, eyeball, especially, to, the, retina, damage, to, the, optic, nerve, that, connects, each, eye, to, the, brain, and, or, from, stroke, infarcts, in, the, brain, temporary, or, permanent, blindness, can, be, caused, by, poisons, or, medications, people, who, are, blind, from, degradation, or, damage, to, the, visual, cortex, but, still, have, functional, eyes, are, actually, capable, of, some, level, of, vision, and, reaction, to, visual, stimuli, but, not, a, conscious, perception, this, is, known, as, blindsight, people, with, blindsight, are, usually, not, aware, that, they, are, reacting, to, visual, sources, and, instead, just, unconsciously, adapt, their, behavior, to, the, stimulus, on, february, 14, 2013, researchers, developed, a, neural, implant, that, gives, rats, the, ability, to, sense, infrared, light, which, for, the, first, time, provides, living, creatures, with, new, abilities, instead, of, simply, replacing, or, augmenting, existing, abilities, according, to, gestalt, psychology, people, perceive, the, whole, of, something, even, if, it, is, not, there, the, gestalt, s, law, of, organization, states, that, people, have, seven, factors, that, help, to, group, what, is, seen, into, patterns, or, groups, common, fate, similarity, proximity, closure, symmetry, continuity, and, past, experience, the, law, of, common, fate, says, that, objects, are, led, along, the, smoothest, path, people, follow, the, trend, of, motion, as, the, lines, dots, flow, the, law, of, similarity, refers, to, the, grouping, of, images, or, objects, that, are, similar, to, each, other, in, some, aspect, this, could, be, due, to, shade, colour, size, shape, or, other, qualities, you, could, distinguish, the, law, of, proximity, states, that, our, minds, like, to, group, based, on, how, close, objects, are, to, each, other, we, may, see, 42, objects, in, a, group, but, we, can, also, perceive, three, groups, of, two, lines, with, seven, objects, in, each, line, the, law, of, closure, is, the, idea, that, we, as, humans, still, see, a, full, picture, even, if, there, are, gaps, within, that, picture, there, could, be, gaps, or, parts, missing, from, a, section, of, a, shape, but, we, would, still, perceive, the, shape, as, whole, the, law, of, symmetry, refers, to, a, person, s, preference, to, see, symmetry, around, a, central, point, an, example, would, be, when, we, use, parentheses, in, writing, we, tend, to, perceive, all, of, the, words, in, the, parentheses, as, one, section, instead, of, individual, words, within, the, parentheses, the, law, of, continuity, tells, us, that, objects, are, grouped, together, by, their, elements, and, then, perceived, as, a, whole, this, usually, happens, when, we, see, overlapping, objects, we, will, see, the, overlapping, objects, with, no, interruptions, the, law, of, past, experience, refers, to, the, tendency, humans, have, to, categorize, objects, according, to, past, experiences, under, certain, circumstances, if, two, objects, are, usually, perceived, together, or, within, close, proximity, of, each, other, the, law, of, past, experience, is, usually, seen, hearing, or, audition, is, the, transduction, of, sound, waves, into, a, neural, signal, that, is, made, possible, by, the, structures, of, the, ear, the, large, fleshy, structure, on, the, lateral, aspect, of, the, head, is, known, as, the, auricle, at, the, end, of, the, auditory, canal, is, the, tympanic, membrane, or, ear, drum, which, vibrates, after, it, is, struck, by, sound, waves, the, auricle, ear, canal, and, tympanic, membrane, are, often, referred, to, as, the, external, ear, the, middle, ear, consists, of, a, space, spanned, by, three, small, bones, called, the, ossicles, the, three, ossicles, are, the, malleus, incus, and, stapes, which, are, latin, names, that, roughly, translate, to, hammer, anvil, and, stirrup, the, malleus, is, attached, to, the, tympanic, membrane, and, articulates, with, the, incus, the, incus, in, turn, articulates, with, the, stapes, the, stapes, is, then, attached, to, the, inner, ear, where, the, sound, waves, will, be, transduced, into, a, neural, signal, the, middle, ear, is, connected, to, the, pharynx, through, the, eustachian, tube, which, helps, equilibrate, air, pressure, across, the, tympanic, membrane, the, tube, is, normally, closed, but, will, pop, open, when, the, muscles, of, the, pharynx, contract, during, swallowing, or, yawning, mechanoreceptors, turn, motion, into, electrical, nerve, pulses, which, are, located, in, the, inner, ear, since, sound, is, vibration, propagating, through, a, medium, such, as, air, the, detection, of, these, vibrations, that, is, the, sense, of, the, hearing, is, a, mechanical, sense, because, these, vibrations, are, mechanically, conducted, from, the, eardrum, through, a, series, of, tiny, bones, to, hair, like, fibers, in, the, inner, ear, which, detect, mechanical, motion, of, the, fibers, within, a, range, of, about, 20, to, 20, 000, hertz, with, substantial, variation, between, individuals, hearing, at, high, frequencies, declines, with, an, increase, in, age, inability, to, hear, is, called, deafness, or, hearing, impairment, sound, can, also, be, detected, as, vibrations, conducted, through, the, body, lower, frequencies, that, can, be, heard, are, detected, this, way, some, deaf, people, are, able, to, determine, the, direction, and, location, of, vibrations, picked, up, through, the, feet, studies, pertaining, to, audition, started, to, increase, in, number, towards, the, latter, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, during, this, time, many, laboratories, in, the, united, states, began, to, create, new, models, diagrams, and, instruments, that, all, pertained, to, the, ear, auditory, cognitive, psychology, is, a, branch, of, cognitive, psychology, that, is, dedicated, to, the, auditory, system, the, main, point, is, to, understand, why, humans, are, able, to, use, sound, in, thinking, outside, of, actually, saying, it, relating, to, auditory, cognitive, psychology, is, psychoacoustics, psychoacoustics, is, more, directed, at, people, interested, in, music, haptics, a, word, used, to, refer, to, both, taction, and, kinesthesia, has, many, parallels, with, psychoacoustics, most, research, around, these, two, are, focused, on, the, instrument, the, listener, and, the, player, of, the, instrument, somatosensation, is, considered, a, general, sense, as, opposed, to, the, special, senses, discussed, in, this, section, somatosensation, is, the, group, of, sensory, modalities, that, are, associated, with, touch, and, interoception, the, modalities, of, somatosensation, include, pressure, vibration, light, touch, tickle, itch, temperature, pain, kinesthesia, somatosensation, also, called, tactition, adjectival, form, tactile, is, a, perception, resulting, from, activation, of, neural, receptors, generally, in, the, skin, including, hair, follicles, but, also, in, the, tongue, throat, and, mucosa, a, variety, of, pressure, receptors, respond, to, variations, in, pressure, firm, brushing, sustained, etc, the, touch, sense, of, itching, caused, by, insect, bites, or, allergies, involves, special, itch, specific, neurons, in, the, skin, and, spinal, cord, the, loss, or, impairment, of, the, ability, to, feel, anything, touched, is, called, tactile, anesthesia, paresthesia, is, a, sensation, of, tingling, pricking, or, numbness, of, the, skin, that, may, result, from, nerve, damage, and, may, be, permanent, or, temporary, two, types, of, somatosensory, signals, that, are, transduced, by, free, nerve, endings, are, pain, and, temperature, these, two, modalities, use, thermoreceptors, and, nociceptors, to, transduce, temperature, and, pain, stimuli, respectively, temperature, receptors, are, stimulated, when, local, temperatures, differ, from, body, temperature, some, thermoreceptors, are, sensitive, to, just, cold, and, others, to, just, heat, nociception, is, the, sensation, of, potentially, damaging, stimuli, mechanical, chemical, or, thermal, stimuli, beyond, a, set, threshold, will, elicit, painful, sensations, stressed, or, damaged, tissues, release, chemicals, that, activate, receptor, proteins, in, the, nociceptors, for, example, the, sensation, of, heat, associated, with, spicy, foods, involves, capsaicin, the, active, molecule, in, hot, peppers, low, frequency, vibrations, are, sensed, by, mechanoreceptors, called, merkel, cells, also, known, as, type, i, cutaneous, mechanoreceptors, merkel, cells, are, located, in, the, stratum, basale, of, the, epidermis, deep, pressure, and, vibration, is, transduced, by, lamellated, pacinian, corpuscles, which, are, receptors, with, encapsulated, endings, found, deep, in, the, dermis, or, subcutaneous, tissue, light, touch, is, transduced, by, the, encapsulated, endings, known, as, tactile, meissner, corpuscles, follicles, are, also, wrapped, in, a, plexus, of, nerve, endings, known, as, the, hair, follicle, plexus, these, nerve, endings, detect, the, movement, of, hair, at, the, surface, of, the, skin, such, as, when, an, insect, may, be, walking, along, the, skin, stretching, of, the, skin, is, transduced, by, stretch, receptors, known, as, bulbous, corpuscles, bulbous, corpuscles, are, also, known, as, ruffini, corpuscles, or, type, ii, cutaneous, mechanoreceptors, the, heat, receptors, are, sensitive, to, infrared, radiation, and, can, occur, in, specialized, organs, for, instance, in, pit, vipers, the, thermoceptors, in, the, skin, are, quite, different, from, the, homeostatic, thermoceptors, in, the, brain, hypothalamus, which, provide, feedback, on, internal, body, temperature, the, gustatory, system, or, the, sense, of, taste, is, the, sensory, system, that, is, partially, responsible, for, the, perception, of, taste, flavor, a, few, recognized, submodalities, exist, within, taste, sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and, umami, very, recent, research, has, suggested, that, there, may, also, be, a, sixth, taste, submodality, for, fats, or, lipids, the, sense, of, taste, is, often, confused, with, the, perception, of, flavor, which, is, the, results, of, the, multimodal, integration, of, gustatory, taste, and, olfactory, smell, sensations, within, the, structure, of, the, lingual, papillae, are, taste, buds, that, contain, specialized, gustatory, receptor, cells, for, the, transduction, of, taste, stimuli, these, receptor, cells, are, sensitive, to, the, chemicals, contained, within, foods, that, are, ingested, and, they, release, neurotransmitters, based, on, the, amount, of, the, chemical, in, the, food, neurotransmitters, from, the, gustatory, cells, can, activate, sensory, neurons, in, the, facial, glossopharyngeal, and, vagus, cranial, nerves, salty, and, sour, taste, submodalities, are, triggered, by, the, cations, na, and, h, respectively, the, other, taste, modalities, result, from, food, molecules, binding, to, a, g, protein, coupled, receptor, a, g, protein, signal, transduction, system, ultimately, leads, to, depolarization, of, the, gustatory, cell, the, sweet, taste, is, the, sensitivity, of, gustatory, cells, to, the, presence, of, glucose, or, sugar, substitutes, dissolved, in, the, saliva, bitter, taste, is, similar, to, sweet, in, that, food, molecules, bind, to, g, protein, coupled, receptors, the, taste, known, as, umami, is, often, referred, to, as, the, savory, taste, like, sweet, and, bitter, it, is, based, on, the, activation, of, g, protein, coupled, receptors, by, a, specific, molecule, once, the, gustatory, cells, are, activated, by, the, taste, molecules, they, release, neurotransmitters, onto, the, dendrites, of, sensory, neurons, these, neurons, are, part, of, the, facial, and, glossopharyngeal, cranial, nerves, as, well, as, a, component, within, the, vagus, nerve, dedicated, to, the, gag, reflex, the, facial, nerve, connects, to, taste, buds, in, the, anterior, third, of, the, tongue, the, glossopharyngeal, nerve, connects, to, taste, buds, in, the, posterior, two, thirds, of, the, tongue, the, vagus, nerve, connects, to, taste, buds, in, the, extreme, posterior, of, the, tongue, verging, on, the, pharynx, which, are, more, sensitive, to, noxious, stimuli, such, as, bitterness, flavor, depends, on, odor, texture, and, temperature, as, well, as, on, taste, humans, receive, tastes, through, sensory, organs, called, taste, buds, or, gustatory, calyculi, concentrated, on, the, upper, surface, of, the, tongue, other, tastes, such, as, calcium, and, free, fatty, acids, may, also, be, basic, tastes, but, have, yet, to, receive, widespread, acceptance, the, inability, to, taste, is, called, ageusia, there, is, a, rare, phenomenon, when, it, comes, to, the, gustatory, sense, it, is, called, lexical, gustatory, synesthesia, lexical, gustatory, synesthesia, is, when, people, can, taste, words, they, have, reported, having, flavor, sensations, they, are, not, actually, eating, when, they, read, words, hear, words, or, even, imagine, words, they, have, reported, not, only, simple, flavors, but, textures, complex, flavors, and, temperatures, as, well, like, the, sense, of, taste, the, sense, of, smell, or, the, olfactory, system, is, also, responsive, to, chemical, stimuli, unlike, taste, there, are, hundreds, of, olfactory, receptors, 388, functional, ones, according, to, one, 2003, study, each, binding, to, a, particular, molecular, feature, odor, molecules, possess, a, variety, of, features, and, thus, excite, specific, receptors, more, or, less, strongly, this, combination, of, excitatory, signals, from, different, receptors, makes, up, what, humans, perceive, as, the, molecule, s, smell, the, olfactory, receptor, neurons, are, located, in, a, small, region, within, the, superior, nasal, cavity, this, region, is, referred, to, as, the, olfactory, epithelium, and, contains, bipolar, sensory, neurons, each, olfactory, sensory, neuron, has, dendrites, that, extend, from, the, apical, surface, of, the, epithelium, into, the, mucus, lining, the, cavity, as, airborne, molecules, are, inhaled, through, the, nose, they, pass, over, the, olfactory, epithelial, region, and, dissolve, into, the, mucus, these, odorant, molecules, bind, to, proteins, that, keep, them, dissolved, in, the, mucus, and, help, transport, them, to, the, olfactory, dendrites, the, odorant, protein, complex, binds, to, a, receptor, protein, within, the, cell, membrane, of, an, olfactory, dendrite, these, receptors, are, g, protein, coupled, and, will, produce, a, graded, membrane, potential, in, the, olfactory, neurons, in, the, brain, olfaction, is, processed, by, the, olfactory, cortex, olfactory, receptor, neurons, in, the, nose, differ, from, most, other, neurons, in, that, they, die, and, regenerate, on, a, regular, basis, the, inability, to, smell, is, called, anosmia, some, neurons, in, the, nose, are, specialized, to, detect, pheromones, loss, of, the, sense, of, smell, can, result, in, food, tasting, bland, a, person, with, an, impaired, sense, of, smell, may, require, additional, spice, and, seasoning, levels, for, food, to, be, tasted, anosmia, may, also, be, related, to, some, presentations, of, mild, depression, because, the, loss, of, enjoyment, of, food, may, lead, to, a, general, sense, of, despair, the, ability, of, olfactory, neurons, to, replace, themselves, decreases, with, age, leading, to, age, related, anosmia, this, explains, why, some, elderly, people, salt, their, food, more, than, younger, people, do, the, vestibular, sense, or, sense, of, balance, equilibrium, is, the, sense, that, contributes, to, the, perception, of, balance, equilibrium, spatial, orientation, direction, or, acceleration, equilibrioception, along, with, audition, the, inner, ear, is, responsible, for, encoding, information, about, equilibrium, a, similar, mechanoreceptor, a, hair, cell, with, stereocilia, senses, head, position, head, movement, and, whether, our, bodies, are, in, motion, these, cells, are, located, within, the, vestibule, of, the, inner, ear, head, position, is, sensed, by, the, utricle, and, saccule, whereas, head, movement, is, sensed, by, the, semicircular, canals, the, neural, signals, generated, in, the, vestibular, ganglion, are, transmitted, through, the, vestibulocochlear, nerve, to, the, brain, stem, and, cerebellum, the, semicircular, canals, are, three, ring, like, extensions, of, the, vestibule, one, is, oriented, in, the, horizontal, plane, whereas, the, other, two, are, oriented, in, the, vertical, plane, the, anterior, and, posterior, vertical, canals, are, oriented, at, approximately, 45, degrees, relative, to, the, sagittal, plane, the, base, of, each, semicircular, canal, where, it, meets, with, the, vestibule, connects, to, an, enlarged, region, known, as, the, ampulla, the, ampulla, contains, the, hair, cells, that, respond, to, rotational, movement, such, as, turning, the, head, while, saying, no, the, stereocilia, of, these, hair, cells, extend, into, the, cupula, a, membrane, that, attaches, to, the, top, of, the, ampulla, as, the, head, rotates, in, a, plane, parallel, to, the, semicircular, canal, the, fluid, lags, deflecting, the, cupula, in, the, direction, opposite, to, the, head, movement, the, semicircular, canals, contain, several, ampullae, with, some, oriented, horizontally, and, others, oriented, vertically, by, comparing, the, relative, movements, of, both, the, horizontal, and, vertical, ampullae, the, vestibular, system, can, detect, the, direction, of, most, head, movements, within, three, dimensional, 3d, space, the, vestibular, nerve, conducts, information, from, sensory, receptors, in, three, ampullae, that, sense, motion, of, fluid, in, three, semicircular, canals, caused, by, three, dimensional, rotation, of, the, head, the, vestibular, nerve, also, conducts, information, from, the, utricle, and, the, saccule, which, contain, hair, like, sensory, receptors, that, bend, under, the, weight, of, otoliths, which, are, small, crystals, of, calcium, carbonate, that, provide, the, inertia, needed, to, detect, head, rotation, linear, acceleration, and, the, direction, of, gravitational, force, an, internal, sensation, and, perception, also, known, as, interoception, is, any, sense, that, is, normally, stimulated, from, within, the, body, these, involve, numerous, sensory, receptors, in, internal, organs, interoception, is, thought, to, be, atypical, in, clinical, conditions, such, as, alexithymia, specific, receptors, include, the, perception, of, time, is, also, sometimes, called, a, sense, though, not, tied, to, a, specific, receptor, other, living, organisms, have, receptors, to, sense, the, world, around, them, including, many, of, the, senses, listed, above, for, humans, however, the, mechanisms, and, capabilities, vary, widely, an, example, of, smell, in, non, mammals, is, that, of, sharks, which, combine, their, keen, sense, of, smell, with, timing, to, determine, the, direction, of, a, smell, they, follow, the, nostril, that, first, detected, the, smell, insects, have, olfactory, receptors, on, their, antennae, although, it, is, unknown, to, the, degree, and, magnitude, which, non, human, mammals, can, smell, better, than, humans, humans, are, known, to, have, far, fewer, olfactory, receptors, than, mice, and, humans, have, also, accumulated, more, genetic, mutations, in, their, olfactory, receptors, than, other, primates, many, animals, salamanders, reptiles, mammals, have, a, vomeronasal, organ, that, is, connected, with, the, mouth, cavity, in, mammals, it, is, mainly, used, to, detect, pheromones, of, marked, territory, trails, and, sexual, state, reptiles, like, snakes, and, monitor, lizards, make, extensive, use, of, it, as, a, smelling, organ, by, transferring, scent, molecules, to, the, vomeronasal, organ, with, the, tips, of, the, forked, tongue, in, reptiles, the, vomeronasal, organ, is, commonly, referred, to, as, jacobson, s, organ, in, mammals, it, is, often, associated, with, a, special, behavior, called, flehmen, characterized, by, uplifting, of, the, lips, the, organ, is, vestigial, in, humans, because, associated, neurons, have, not, been, found, that, give, any, sensory, input, in, humans, flies, and, butterflies, have, taste, organs, on, their, feet, allowing, them, to, taste, anything, they, land, on, catfish, have, taste, organs, across, their, entire, bodies, and, can, taste, anything, they, touch, including, chemicals, in, the, water, cats, have, the, ability, to, see, in, low, light, which, is, due, to, muscles, surrounding, their, irides, which, contract, and, expand, their, pupils, as, well, as, to, the, tapetum, lucidum, a, reflective, membrane, that, optimizes, the, image, pit, vipers, pythons, and, some, boas, have, organs, that, allow, them, to, detect, infrared, light, such, that, these, snakes, are, able, to, sense, the, body, heat, of, their, prey, the, common, vampire, bat, may, also, have, an, infrared, sensor, on, its, nose, it, has, been, found, that, birds, and, some, other, animals, are, tetrachromats, and, have, the, ability, to, see, in, the, ultraviolet, down, to, 300, nanometers, bees, and, dragonflies, are, also, able, to, see, in, the, ultraviolet, mantis, shrimps, can, perceive, both, polarized, light, and, multispectral, images, and, have, twelve, distinct, kinds, of, color, receptors, unlike, humans, which, have, three, kinds, and, most, mammals, which, have, two, kinds, cephalopods, have, the, ability, to, change, color, using, chromatophores, in, their, skin, researchers, believe, that, opsins, in, the, skin, can, sense, different, wavelengths, of, light, and, help, the, creatures, choose, a, coloration, that, camouflages, them, in, addition, to, light, input, from, the, eyes, other, researchers, hypothesize, that, cephalopod, eyes, in, species, which, only, have, a, single, photoreceptor, protein, may, use, chromatic, aberration, to, turn, monochromatic, vision, into, color, vision, explaining, pupils, shaped, like, the, letter, u, the, letter, w, or, a, dumbbell, as, well, as, explaining, the, need, for, colorful, mating, displays, some, cephalopods, can, distinguish, the, polarization, of, light, many, invertebrates, have, a, statocyst, which, is, a, sensor, for, acceleration, and, orientation, that, works, very, differently, from, the, mammalian, s, semi, circular, canals, in, addition, some, animals, have, senses, that, humans, lack, magnetoception, or, magnetoreception, is, the, ability, to, detect, the, direction, one, is, facing, based, on, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, directional, awareness, is, most, commonly, observed, in, birds, which, rely, on, their, magnetic, sense, to, navigate, during, migration, it, has, also, been, observed, in, insects, such, as, bees, cattle, make, use, of, magnetoception, to, align, themselves, in, a, north, south, direction, magnetotactic, bacteria, build, miniature, magnets, inside, themselves, and, use, them, to, determine, their, orientation, relative, to, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, there, has, been, some, recent, tentative, research, suggesting, that, the, rhodopsin, in, the, human, eye, which, responds, particularly, well, to, blue, light, can, facilitate, magnetoception, in, humans, certain, animals, including, bats, and, cetaceans, have, the, ability, to, determine, orientation, to, other, objects, through, interpretation, of, reflected, sound, like, sonar, they, most, often, use, this, to, navigate, through, poor, lighting, conditions, or, to, identify, and, track, prey, there, is, currently, an, uncertainty, whether, this, is, simply, an, extremely, developed, post, sensory, interpretation, of, auditory, perceptions, or, it, actually, constitutes, a, separate, sense, resolution, of, the, issue, will, require, brain, scans, of, animals, while, they, actually, perform, echolocation, a, task, that, has, proven, difficult, in, practice, blind, people, report, they, are, able, to, navigate, and, in, some, cases, identify, an, object, by, interpreting, reflected, sounds, especially, their, own, footsteps, a, phenomenon, known, as, human, echolocation, electroreception, or, electroception, is, the, ability, to, detect, electric, fields, several, species, of, fish, sharks, and, rays, have, the, capacity, to, sense, changes, in, electric, fields, in, their, immediate, vicinity, for, cartilaginous, fish, this, occurs, through, a, specialized, organ, called, the, ampullae, of, lorenzini, some, fish, passively, sense, changing, nearby, electric, fields, some, generate, their, own, weak, electric, fields, and, sense, the, pattern, of, field, potentials, over, their, body, surface, and, some, use, these, electric, field, generating, and, sensing, capacities, for, social, communication, the, mechanisms, by, which, electroceptive, fish, construct, a, spatial, representation, from, very, small, differences, in, field, potentials, involve, comparisons, of, spike, latencies, from, different, parts, of, the, fish, s, body, the, only, orders, of, mammals, that, are, known, to, demonstrate, electroception, are, the, dolphin, and, monotreme, orders, among, these, mammals, the, platypus, has, the, most, acute, sense, of, electroception, a, dolphin, can, detect, electric, fields, in, water, using, electroreceptors, in, vibrissal, crypts, arrayed, in, pairs, on, its, snout, and, which, evolved, from, whisker, motion, sensors, these, electroreceptors, can, detect, electric, fields, as, weak, as, 4, 6, microvolts, per, centimeter, such, as, those, generated, by, contracting, muscles, and, pumping, gills, of, potential, prey, this, permits, the, dolphin, to, locate, prey, from, the, seafloor, where, sediment, limits, visibility, and, echolocation, spiders, have, been, shown, to, detect, electric, fields, to, determine, a, suitable, time, to, extend, web, for, ballooning, body, modification, enthusiasts, have, experimented, with, magnetic, implants, to, attempt, to, replicate, this, sense, however, in, general, humans, and, it, is, presumed, other, mammals, can, detect, electric, fields, only, indirectly, by, detecting, the, effect, they, have, on, hairs, an, electrically, charged, balloon, for, instance, will, exert, a, force, on, human, arm, hairs, which, can, be, felt, through, tactition, and, identified, as, coming, from, a, static, charge, and, not, from, wind, or, the, like, this, is, not, electroreception, as, it, is, a, post, sensory, cognitive, action, hygroreception, is, the, ability, to, detect, changes, in, the, moisture, content, of, the, environment, the, ability, to, sense, infrared, thermal, radiation, evolved, independently, in, various, families, of, snakes, essentially, it, allows, these, reptiles, to, see, radiant, heat, at, wavelengths, between, 5, and, 30, m, to, a, degree, of, accuracy, such, that, a, blind, rattlesnake, can, target, vulnerable, body, parts, of, the, prey, at, which, it, strikes, it, was, previously, thought, that, the, organs, evolved, primarily, as, prey, detectors, but, it, is, now, believed, that, it, may, also, be, used, in, thermoregulatory, decision, making, the, facial, pit, underwent, parallel, evolution, in, pitvipers, and, some, boas, and, pythons, having, evolved, once, in, pitvipers, and, multiple, times, in, boas, and, pythons, the, electrophysiology, of, the, structure, is, similar, between, the, two, lineages, but, they, differ, in, gross, structural, anatomy, most, superficially, pitvipers, possess, one, large, pit, organ, on, either, side, of, the, head, between, the, eye, and, the, nostril, loreal, pit, while, boas, and, pythons, have, three, or, more, comparatively, smaller, pits, lining, the, upper, and, sometimes, the, lower, lip, in, or, between, the, scales, those, of, the, pitvipers, are, the, more, advanced, having, a, suspended, sensory, membrane, as, opposed, to, a, simple, pit, structure, within, the, family, viperidae, the, pit, organ, is, seen, only, in, the, subfamily, crotalinae, the, pitvipers, the, organ, is, used, extensively, to, detect, and, target, endothermic, prey, such, as, rodents, and, birds, and, it, was, previously, assumed, that, the, organ, evolved, specifically, for, that, purpose, however, recent, evidence, shows, that, the, pit, organ, may, also, be, used, for, thermoregulation, according, to, krochmal, et, al, pitvipers, can, use, their, pits, for, thermoregulatory, decision, making, while, true, vipers, vipers, who, do, not, contain, heat, sensing, pits, cannot, in, spite, of, its, detection, of, ir, light, the, pits, ir, detection, mechanism, is, not, similar, to, photoreceptors, while, photoreceptors, detect, light, via, photochemical, reactions, the, protein, in, the, pits, of, snakes, is, in, fact, a, temperature, sensitive, ion, channel, it, senses, infrared, signals, through, a, mechanism, involving, warming, of, the, pit, organ, rather, than, a, chemical, reaction, to, light, this, is, consistent, with, the, thin, pit, membrane, which, allows, incoming, ir, radiation, to, quickly, and, precisely, warm, a, given, ion, channel, and, trigger, a, nerve, impulse, as, well, as, vascularize, the, pit, membrane, in, order, to, rapidly, cool, the, ion, channel, back, to, its, original, resting, or, inactive, temperature, pressure, detection, uses, the, organ, of, weber, a, system, consisting, of, three, appendages, of, vertebrae, transferring, changes, in, shape, of, the, gas, bladder, to, the, middle, ear, it, can, be, used, to, regulate, the, buoyancy, of, the, fish, fish, like, the, weather, fish, and, other, loaches, are, also, known, to, respond, to, low, pressure, areas, but, they, lack, a, swim, bladder, current, detection, is, a, detection, system, of, water, currents, consisting, mostly, of, vortices, found, in, the, lateral, line, of, fish, and, aquatic, forms, of, amphibians, the, lateral, line, is, also, sensitive, to, low, frequency, vibrations, the, mechanoreceptors, are, hair, cells, the, same, mechanoreceptors, for, vestibular, sense, and, hearing, it, is, used, primarily, for, navigation, hunting, and, schooling, the, receptors, of, the, electrical, sense, are, modified, hair, cells, of, the, lateral, line, system, polarized, light, direction, detection, is, used, by, bees, to, orient, themselves, especially, on, cloudy, days, cuttlefish, some, beetles, and, mantis, shrimp, can, also, perceive, the, polarization, of, light, most, sighted, humans, can, in, fact, learn, to, roughly, detect, large, areas, of, polarization, by, an, effect, called, haidinger, s, brush, however, this, is, considered, an, entoptic, phenomenon, rather, than, a, separate, sense, slit, sensillae, of, spiders, detect, mechanical, strain, in, the, exoskeleton, providing, information, on, force, and, vibrations, by, using, a, variety, of, sense, receptors, plants, sense, light, temperature, humidity, chemical, substances, chemical, gradients, reorientation, magnetic, fields, infections, tissue, damage, and, mechanical, pressure, the, absence, of, a, nervous, system, notwithstanding, plants, interpret, and, respond, to, these, stimuli, by, a, variety, of, hormonal, and, cell, to, cell, communication, pathways, that, result, in, movement, morphological, changes, and, physiological, state, alterations, at, the, organism, level, that, is, result, in, plant, behavior, such, physiological, and, cognitive, functions, are, generally, not, believed, to, give, rise, to, mental, phenomena, or, qualia, however, as, these, are, typically, considered, the, product, of, nervous, system, activity, the, emergence, of, mental, phenomena, from, the, activity, of, systems, functionally, or, computationally, analogous, to, that, of, nervous, systems, is, however, a, hypothetical, possibility, explored, by, some, schools, of, thought, in, the, philosophy, of, mind, field, such, as, functionalism, and, computationalism, however, plants, can, perceive, the, world, around, them, and, might, be, able, to, emit, airborne, sounds, similar, to, screaming, when, stressed, those, noises, could, not, be, detectable, by, human, ears, but, organisms, with, a,
