a, pupa, from, latin, pupa, doll, pl, pupae, is, the, life, stage, of, some, insects, undergoing, transformation, between, immature, and, mature, stages, insects, that, go, through, a, pupal, stage, are, holometabolous, they, go, through, four, distinct, stages, in, their, life, cycle, the, stages, thereof, being, egg, larva, pupa, and, imago, the, processes, of, entering, and, completing, the, pupal, stage, are, controlled, by, the, insect, s, hormones, especially, juvenile, hormone, prothoracicotropic, hormone, and, ecdysone, the, act, of, becoming, a, pupa, is, called, pupation, and, the, act, of, emerging, from, the, pupal, case, is, called, eclosion, or, emergence, the, pupae, of, different, groups, of, insects, have, different, names, such, as, chrysalis, for, the, pupae, of, butterflies, and, tumbler, for, those, of, the, mosquito, family, pupae, may, further, be, enclosed, in, other, structures, such, as, cocoons, nests, or, shells, the, pupal, stage, follows, the, larval, stage, or, in, some, cases, a, prepupal, stage, and, precedes, adulthood, imago, in, insects, with, complete, metamorphosis, the, pupa, is, a, non, feeding, usually, sessile, stage, or, highly, active, as, in, mosquitoes, it, is, during, the, pupal, stage, that, the, adult, structures, of, the, insect, are, formed, while, the, larval, structures, are, broken, down, the, adult, structures, grow, from, imaginal, discs, the, pupal, stage, may, last, weeks, months, or, even, years, depending, on, temperature, and, the, species, of, insect, for, example, the, pupal, stage, lasts, eight, to, fifteen, days, in, monarch, butterflies, the, pupa, may, enter, dormancy, or, diapause, until, the, appropriate, season, to, emerge, as, an, adult, insect, in, temperate, climates, pupae, usually, stay, dormant, during, winter, while, in, the, tropics, pupae, usually, do, so, during, the, dry, season, insects, emerge, eclose, from, pupae, by, splitting, the, pupal, case, most, butterflies, emerge, in, the, morning, in, mosquitoes, the, emergence, is, in, the, evening, or, night, in, fleas, the, process, is, triggered, by, vibrations, that, indicate, the, possible, presence, of, a, suitable, host, prior, to, emergence, the, adult, inside, the, pupal, exoskeleton, is, termed, pharate, once, the, pharate, adult, has, eclosed, from, the, pupa, the, empty, pupal, exoskeleton, is, called, an, exuvia, in, most, hymenopterans, ants, bees, and, wasps, the, exuvia, is, so, thin, and, membranous, that, it, becomes, crumpled, as, it, is, shed, measuring, the, timing, of, this, emergence, is, of, interest, to, chronobiologists, because, the, process, is, regulated, by, circadian, clocks, in, many, species, necessitating, different, assays, to, measure, eclosion, timing, in, a, few, taxa, of, the, lepidoptera, especially, heliconius, pupal, mating, is, an, extreme, form, of, reproductive, strategy, in, which, the, adult, male, mates, with, a, female, pupa, about, to, emerge, or, with, the, newly, moulted, female, this, is, accompanied, by, other, actions, such, as, capping, of, the, reproductive, system, of, the, female, with, the, sphragis, denying, access, to, other, males, or, by, exuding, an, anti, aphrodisiac, pheromone, pupae, are, usually, immobile, and, are, largely, defenseless, to, overcome, this, pupae, often, are, covered, with, a, cocoon, conceal, themselves, in, the, environment, or, form, underground, some, species, of, lycaenid, butterflies, are, protected, in, their, pupal, stage, by, ants, another, means, of, defense, by, pupae, of, other, species, is, the, capability, of, making, sounds, or, vibrations, to, scare, potential, predators, a, few, species, use, chemical, defenses, including, toxic, secretions, the, pupae, of, social, hymenopterans, are, protected, by, adult, members, of, the, hive, based, on, the, presence, or, absence, of, articulated, mandibles, that, are, employed, in, emerging, from, a, cocoon, or, pupal, case, the, pupae, can, be, classified, in, to, two, types, based, on, whether, the, pupal, appendages, are, free, or, attached, to, the, body, the, pupae, can, be, classified, as, one, of, three, types, a, chrysalis, latin, chrysallis, from, ancient, greek, chrysall, s, plural, chrysalides, also, known, as, an, aurelia, or, nympha, is, the, pupal, stage, of, butterflies, the, term, is, derived, from, the, metallic, gold, coloration, found, in, the, pupae, of, many, butterflies, referred, to, by, the, ancient, greek, term, chrys, s, for, gold, when, the, caterpillar, is, fully, grown, it, makes, a, button, of, silk, which, it, uses, to, fasten, its, body, to, a, leaf, or, a, twig, then, the, caterpillar, s, skin, comes, off, for, the, final, time, under, this, old, skin, is, a, hard, skin, called, a, chrysalis, because, chrysalises, are, often, showy, and, are, formed, in, the, open, they, are, the, most, familiar, examples, of, pupae, most, chrysalides, are, attached, to, a, surface, by, a, velcro, like, arrangement, of, a, silken, pad, spun, by, the, caterpillar, usually, cemented, to, the, underside, of, a, perch, and, the, cremastral, hook, or, hooks, protruding, from, the, rear, of, the, chrysalis, or, cremaster, at, the, tip, of, the, pupal, abdomen, by, which, the, caterpillar, fixes, itself, to, the, pad, of, silk, gr, kremastos, suspended, like, other, types, of, pupae, the, chrysalis, stage, in, most, butterflies, is, one, in, which, there, is, little, movement, however, some, butterfly, pupae, are, capable, of, moving, the, abdominal, segments, to, produce, sounds, or, to, scare, away, potential, predators, within, the, chrysalis, growth, and, differentiation, occur, the, adult, butterfly, emerges, ecloses, from, this, and, expands, its, wings, by, pumping, haemolymph, into, the, wing, veins, although, this, sudden, and, rapid, change, from, pupa, to, imago, is, often, called, metamorphosis, metamorphosis, is, really, the, whole, series, of, changes, that, an, insect, undergoes, from, egg, to, adult, when, emerging, the, butterfly, uses, a, liquid, sometimes, called, cocoonase, which, softens, the, shell, of, the, chrysalis, additionally, it, uses, two, sharp, claws, located, on, the, thick, joints, at, the, base, of, the, forewings, to, help, make, its, way, out, having, emerged, from, the, chrysalis, the, butterfly, will, usually, sit, on, the, empty, shell, in, order, to, expand, and, harden, its, wings, however, if, the, chrysalis, was, near, the, ground, such, as, if, it, fell, off, from, its, silk, pad, the, butterfly, would, find, another, vertical, surface, to, rest, upon, and, harden, its, wings, such, as, a, wall, or, fence, moth, pupae, are, usually, dark, in, color, and, either, formed, in, underground, cells, loose, in, the, soil, or, their, pupa, is, contained, in, a, protective, silk, case, called, a, cocoon, the, pupa, of, some, species, such, as, the, hornet, moth, develops, sharp, ridges, around, the, outside, called, adminicula, that, allow, the, pupa, to, move, from, its, place, of, concealment, inside, a, tree, trunk, when, it, is, time, for, the, adult, to, emerge, pupa, chrysalis, and, cocoon, are, frequently, confused, but, are, quite, distinct, from, each, other, the, pupa, is, the, stage, between, the, larva, and, adult, stages, the, chrysalis, generally, refers, to, a, butterfly, pupa, although, the, term, may, be, misleading, as, there, are, some, moths, whose, pupae, resembles, a, chrysalis, e, g, the, plume, winged, moths, of, the, family, pterophoridae, and, some, geometrid, moths, a, cocoon, is, a, silk, case, that, the, larvae, of, moths, and, sometimes, other, insects, spin, around, the, pupa, a, cocoon, is, a, casing, spun, of, silk, by, many, moths, and, caterpillars, and, numerous, other, holometabolous, insect, larvae, as, a, protective, covering, for, the, pupa, cocoons, may, be, tough, or, soft, opaque, or, translucent, solid, or, meshlike, of, various, colors, or, composed, of, multiple, layers, depending, on, the, type, of, insect, larva, producing, it, many, moth, caterpillars, shed, the, larval, hairs, setae, and, incorporate, them, into, the, cocoon, if, these, are, urticating, hairs, then, the, cocoon, is, also, irritating, to, the, touch, some, larvae, attach, small, twigs, fecal, pellets, or, pieces, of, vegetation, to, the, outside, of, their, cocoon, in, an, attempt, to, disguise, it, from, predators, others, spin, their, cocoon, in, a, concealed, location, on, the, underside, of, a, leaf, in, a, crevice, down, near, the, base, of, a, tree, trunk, suspended, from, a, twig, or, concealed, in, the, leaf, litter, contrary, to, popular, belief, larvae, do, not, completely, liquify, inside, the, cocoon, the, silk, in, the, cocoon, of, the, silk, moth, can, be, unraveled, to, harvest, silk, fibre, which, makes, this, moth, the, most, economically, important, of, all, lepidopterans, the, silk, moth, is, the, only, completely, domesticated, lepidopteran, it, does, not, exist, in, the, wild, insects, that, pupate, in, a, cocoon, must, escape, from, it, and, they, do, this, either, by, the, pupa, cutting, its, way, out, or, by, secreting, enzymes, sometimes, called, cocoonase, that, soften, the, cocoon, some, cocoons, are, constructed, with, built, in, lines, of, weakness, along, which, they, will, tear, easily, from, inside, or, with, exit, holes, that, only, allow, a, one, way, passage, out, such, features, facilitate, the, escape, of, the, adult, insect, after, it, emerges, from, the, pupal, skin, some, pupae, remain, inside, the, exoskeleton, of, the, final, larval, instar, and, this, last, larval, shell, is, called, a, puparium, plural, puparia, flies, of, the, group, muscomorpha, have, puparia, as, do, members, of, the, order, strepsiptera, and, the, hemipteran, family, aleyrodidae
