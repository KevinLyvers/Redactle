https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirenia
the, sirenia, s, a, r, i, n, i, commonly, referred, to, as, sea, cows, or, sirenians, are, an, order, of, fully, aquatic, herbivorous, mammals, that, inhabit, swamps, rivers, estuaries, marine, wetlands, and, coastal, marine, waters, the, extant, sirenia, comprise, two, distinct, families, dugongidae, the, dugong, and, the, now, extinct, steller, s, sea, cow, and, trichechidae, manatees, namely, the, amazonian, manatee, west, indian, manatee, and, west, african, manatee, with, a, total, of, four, species, the, protosirenidae, eocene, sirenians, and, prorastomidae, terrestrial, sirenians, families, are, extinct, sirenians, are, classified, in, the, clade, paenungulata, alongside, the, elephants, and, the, hyraxes, and, evolved, in, the, eocene, 50, million, years, ago, mya, the, dugongidae, diverged, from, the, trichechidae, in, the, late, eocene, or, early, oligocene, 30, 35, mya, sirenians, grow, to, between, 2, 5, and, 4, metres, 8, 2, and, 13, 1, feet, in, length, and, 1, 500, kilograms, 3, 300, pounds, in, weight, the, recently, extinct, steller, s, sea, cow, was, the, largest, known, sirenian, to, have, lived, reaching, lengths, of, 10, metres, 33, feet, and, weights, of, 5, to, 10, tonnes, 5, 5, to, 11, 0, short, tons, sirenians, have, a, large, fusiform, body, which, reduces, drag, through, the, water, and, heavy, bones, that, act, as, ballast, to, counteract, the, buoyancy, of, their, blubber, they, have, a, thin, layer, of, blubber, and, consequently, are, sensitive, to, temperature, fluctuations, which, cause, migrations, when, water, temperatures, dip, too, low, sirenians, are, slow, moving, typically, coasting, at, 8, kilometres, per, hour, 5, 0, miles, per, hour, but, they, can, reach, 24, kilometres, per, hour, 15, miles, per, hour, in, short, bursts, they, use, their, strong, lips, to, pull, out, seagrasses, consuming, 10, 15, of, their, body, weight, per, day, while, breathing, sirenians, hold, just, their, nostrils, above, the, surface, sometimes, standing, on, their, tails, to, do, so, they, typically, inhabit, warm, shallow, coastal, waters, or, rivers, they, are, mainly, herbivorous, but, have, been, known, to, consume, animals, such, as, birds, and, jellyfish, males, typically, mate, with, more, than, one, female, and, may, gather, in, leks, to, mate, sirenians, are, k, selected, displaying, parental, care, the, meat, oil, bones, and, skins, are, commercially, valuable, mortality, is, often, caused, by, direct, hunting, by, humans, or, other, human, induced, causes, such, as, habitat, destruction, entanglement, in, fishing, gear, and, watercraft, collisions, steller, s, sea, cow, was, driven, to, extinction, due, to, overhunting, in, 1768, sirenia, commonly, sirenians, are, also, referred, to, by, the, common, name, sirens, deriving, from, the, sirens, of, greek, mythology, sirenians, are, classified, within, the, cohort, afrotheria, in, the, clade, paenungulata, alongside, proboscidea, elephants, hyracoidea, hyraxes, embrithopoda, desmostylia, and, afroinsectiphilia, this, clade, was, first, established, by, george, gaylord, simpson, in, 1945, on, the, basis, of, anatomical, evidence, such, as, testicondy, and, similar, fetal, development, the, paenungulata, along, with, the, afrotheria, are, one, of, the, most, well, supported, mammalian, clades, in, molecular, phylogeny, sirenia, proboscidae, and, desmotylia, are, grouped, together, in, the, clade, tethytheria, on, the, basis, of, morphological, similarities, tethytheria, perissodactyla, and, hyracoidea, were, previously, thought, to, be, grouped, together, as, the, altungulata, but, this, has, been, invalidated, by, molecular, data, procaviidae, trichechidae, dugongidae, elephantidae, orycteropodidae, macroscelididae, chrysochloridae, potamogalidae, tenrecidae, extinct, family, dugongidae, family, trichechidae, family, protosirenidae, family, prorastomidae, distribution, the, warm, shallow, waters, of, the, equator, have, been, the, center, of, sirenian, habitation, the, northernmost, living, population, the, florida, subspecies, of, the, west, indian, manatee, t, manatus, latirostris, inhabits, the, coast, and, frequents, freshwater, springs, power, plants, and, canals, in, florida, to, stay, warm, during, the, winter, individuals, may, migrate, north, in, the, warm, summer, months, some, up, to, 1, 000, kilometers, about, 621, 37, mi, from, their, winter, range, the, antillean, subspecies, t, manatus, manatus, occurs, in, the, caribbean, south, america, and, central, america, and, frequent, drowned, cays, mangroves, lagoons, and, sea, grass, beds, the, amazonian, manatee, t, inunguis, has, been, documented, in, all, parts, of, the, amazon, river, basin, in, south, america, river, channels, that, connect, allow, easy, travel, to, other, waterways, where, food, may, be, plentiful, the, amazonian, manatee, lives, only, in, freshwater, the, west, african, manatee, t, senegalensis, lives, in, murky, isolated, inland, mangroves, and, coastal, flats, in, west, africa, it, is, found, in, waters, above, 18, c, and, its, range, spans, senegal, to, angola, the, dugong, dugong, dugong, the, closest, living, relative, of, steller, s, sea, cow, lives, in, the, indo, west, pacific, ocean, in, more, than, 40, different, countries, they, are, coastal, animals, supported, by, wide, protected, sea, grass, meadows, steller, s, sea, cow, was, discovered, in, 1741, around, islands, in, the, bering, sea, and, was, specialized, for, cold, subarctic, temperatures, it, ranged, from, alaska, through, the, amchitka, and, aleutian, islands, and, even, to, japan, steller, s, sea, cow, was, reported, to, have, congregated, in, shallow, sandy, areas, along, coastline, and, mouths, of, rivers, and, creeks, to, feed, on, kelp, the, evolution, of, sirenians, is, characterized, by, the, appearance, of, several, traits, that, are, found, in, all, sirenians, the, nostrils, are, large, and, retracted, the, upper, jaw, bone, contacts, the, frontal, bone, the, sagittal, crest, is, missing, the, mastoid, fills, the, supratemporal, fenestra, an, opening, on, the, top, of, the, skull, there, is, a, drop, like, ectotympanic, a, bony, ring, that, holds, the, ear, drum, and, the, bones, are, pachyosteosclerotic, dense, and, bulky, sirenians, first, appeared, in, the, fossil, record, in, the, early, eocene, and, diversified, throughout, the, epoch, they, inhabited, rivers, estuaries, and, nearshore, marine, waters, sirenians, unlike, other, marine, mammals, such, as, cetaceans, lived, in, the, new, world, in, western, europe, the, first, and, oldest, sirenian, remains, have, been, found, in, a, new, paleontological, site, in, santa, br, gida, amer, la, selva, catalonia, spain, one, of, the, earliest, aquatic, sirenians, discovered, is, prorastomus, which, dates, back, to, 40, million, years, ago, and, the, first, known, sirenian, the, quadruped, pezosiren, lived, 50, million, years, ago, an, ancient, sirenian, fossil, of, a, petrosal, bone, was, found, in, tunisia, dating, back, to, approximately, the, same, time, as, prorastomus, this, is, the, oldest, sirenian, fossil, to, be, found, in, africa, and, supports, molecular, data, suggesting, that, sirenians, may, have, originated, in, africa, prorastomidae, and, protosirenidae, the, earliest, sirenian, families, consisted, of, pig, like, amphibious, creatures, who, died, out, at, the, end, of, the, eocene, with, the, appearance, of, the, dugongidae, at, this, time, sirenians, had, evolved, the, characteristics, of, the, modern, order, including, an, aquatic, streamlined, body, with, flipper, like, fore, limbs, and, no, hind, limbs, and, a, powerful, tail, with, horizontal, caudal, fins, which, uses, an, up, and, down, motion, to, move, them, through, the, water, the, last, of, the, sirenian, families, to, appear, trichechidae, apparently, arose, from, early, dugongids, in, the, late, eocene, or, early, oligocene, in, 1994, the, family, was, expanded, to, include, not, only, the, subfamily, trichechinae, potamosiren, ribodon, and, trichechus, but, also, miosireninae, anomotherium, and, miosiren, the, african, manatee, and, the, west, indian, manatee, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, the, amazonian, manatee, dugongidae, comprises, the, subfamilies, dugonginae, and, hydrodamalinae, and, the, paraphyletic, halitheriinae, the, tusks, of, modern, day, dugongs, may, have, originally, been, used, for, digging, but, they, are, now, used, for, social, interaction, the, genus, dugong, probably, originated, in, the, indo, pacific, the, tail, fluke, of, a, dugong, is, notched, and, similar, to, those, of, dolphins, whereas, the, tail, fluke, of, manatee, is, paddle, shaped, the, fluke, is, pumped, up, and, down, in, long, strokes, to, move, the, animal, forward, or, twisted, to, turn, the, forelimbs, are, paddle, like, flippers, which, aid, in, turning, and, slowing, unlike, manatees, the, dugong, lacks, nails, on, its, flippers, which, are, only, 15, of, a, dugong, s, body, length, manatees, generally, glide, at, speeds, of, 8, kilometres, per, hour, 5, mph, but, can, reach, speeds, of, 24, kilometres, per, hour, 15, mph, in, short, bursts, the, body, is, fusiform, to, reduce, drag, in, the, water, like, those, of, cetaceans, the, hind, limbs, are, internal, and, vestigial, the, snout, is, angled, downwards, to, aid, in, bottom, feeding, sirenians, typically, make, two, to, three, minute, dives, but, manatees, can, hold, their, breath, for, up, to, 15, minutes, while, resting, and, dugongs, up, to, six, minutes, they, may, stand, on, their, tails, to, hold, their, heads, above, water, much, like, elephants, manatees, are, polyphyodonts, continuously, replacing, their, teeth, from, the, back, of, the, jaw, adults, lack, incisors, canines, and, premolars, and, instead, have, 8, to, 10, cheek, teeth, manatees, have, an, unlimited, supply, of, teeth, moving, in, from, the, back, and, shedding, in, the, front, these, are, continuously, formed, by, a, dental, capsule, behind, the, tooth, row, these, teeth, are, constantly, worn, down, by, the, abrasive, vascular, plants, they, forage, particularly, aquatic, grasses, unlike, those, of, manatees, the, dugong, s, teeth, do, not, continually, grow, back, via, horizontal, tooth, replacement, the, dugong, has, two, tusks, which, emerge, in, males, during, puberty, and, sometime, later, in, life, for, females, after, reaching, the, base, of, the, premaxilla, the, number, of, growth, layer, groups, in, a, tusk, indicates, the, age, of, a, dugong, sirenians, exhibit, pachyostosis, a, condition, in, which, the, ribs, and, other, long, bones, are, solid, and, contain, little, or, no, bone, marrow, they, have, among, the, densest, bones, in, the, animal, kingdom, these, may, act, as, ballast, countering, the, buoyancy, of, their, blubber, and, helping, them, remain, suspended, slightly, below, the, water, s, surface, manatees, do, not, possess, blubber, per, se, but, rather, have, thick, skin, and, consequently, are, sensitive, to, temperature, changes, they, often, migrate, to, warmer, waters, whenever, the, water, temperature, dips, below, 20, c, 68, f, the, lungs, of, sirenians, are, unlobed, along, with, the, diaphragm, these, extend, the, entire, length, of, the, vertebral, column, helping, the, animals, control, their, buoyancy, and, reducing, tipping, in, the, water, extant, sirenians, grow, to, between, 2, 5, and, 4, metres, 8, 2, and, 13, 1, ft, in, length, and, can, weigh, up, to, 1, 500, kilograms, 3, 300, lb, steller, s, sea, cow, was, the, largest, known, sirenian, to, have, lived, and, could, reach, lengths, of, 9, metres, 30, ft, and, weight, of, 8, to, 10, tonnes, 8, 8, to, 11, 0, short, tons, a, dugong, s, brain, weighs, a, maximum, of, 300, grams, 11, ounces, about, 0, 1, of, the, animal, s, body, weight, the, bodies, of, sirenians, are, sparsely, covered, in, short, hair, vibrissae, except, that, it, becomes, denser, on, the, muzzle, which, may, allow, for, tactile, interpretation, of, their, environment, manatees, are, the, only, known, organism, with, uniformly, vascularized, corneas, this, may, be, the, result, of, irritation, from, or, protection, against, their, hypotonic, freshwater, environment, sirenians, are, referred, to, as, sea, cows, because, their, diet, consists, mainly, of, seagrass, dugongs, sift, through, the, seafloor, in, search, of, seagrasses, using, their, sense, of, smell, because, their, eyesight, is, poor, they, ingest, the, whole, plant, including, the, roots, although, they, will, feed, on, just, the, leaves, if, this, is, not, possible, using, its, divided, upper, lip, the, west, indian, manatee, is, known, to, consume, over, 60, different, freshwater, and, saltwater, plants, such, as, shoalweed, water, lettuce, muskgrass, manatee, grass, and, turtle, grass, an, adult, manatee, will, commonly, eat, up, to, 10, 15, of, its, body, weight, or, 50, kilograms, 110, lb, per, day, which, requires, the, manatee, to, graze, for, several, hours, per, day, by, contrast, 10, of, the, diet, of, the, african, manatee, is, fish, and, mollusks, manatees, have, been, known, to, eat, small, amounts, of, fish, from, nets, as, opposed, to, bulk, feeding, dugongs, target, high, nitrogen, grasses, to, maximize, nutrient, intake, and, although, predominantly, herbivorous, dugongs, will, occasionally, eat, invertebrates, such, as, jellyfish, sea, squirts, and, shellfish, some, populations, of, dugongs, such, as, the, one, in, moreton, bay, australia, are, omnivorous, feeding, on, invertebrates, such, as, polychaetes, or, marine, algae, when, their, supply, of, seagrasses, is, low, in, other, dugong, populations, in, western, and, eastern, australia, there, is, evidence, that, dugongs, actively, seek, out, large, invertebrates, populations, of, amazonian, manatees, become, restricted, to, lakes, during, the, july, august, dry, season, when, water, levels, begin, to, fall, and, are, thought, to, fast, during, this, period, their, large, fat, reserves, and, low, metabolic, rates, only, 36, of, the, usual, placental, mammal, metabolic, rate, allow, them, to, survive, for, up, to, seven, months, with, little, or, no, food, perioral, bristles, are, not, only, used, to, sense, things, but, can, be, used, to, grasp, and, manipulate, food, of, the, 6, distinct, fields, of, bristles, on, upper, and, lower, lips, the, perioral, fields, have, distinct, length, to, diameter, ratios, defining, their, boundaries, macrovibrissae, are, used, to, detect, food, by, its, size, and, microvibrissae, to, manipulate, food, they, can, be, used, to, break, off, leaves, and, undesirable, parts, while, feeding, sirenians, use, their, elaborate, facial, musculature, along, with, perioral, bristles, to, acquire, manipulate, and, ingest, aquatic, vegetation, the, snout, makes, up, a, muscular, hydrostat, a, biological, structure, that, relies, on, muscular, pressure, and, muscle, contractions, to, manipulate, and, move, food, the, manatee, uses, its, large, upper, perioral, bristles, to, carry, out, a, grasping, motion, it, performs, a, flare, that, tightens, the, muscular, hydrostat, while, the, large, upper, bristles, get, pushed, out, and, the, lower, jaw, drops, and, sweeps, the, vegetation, in, by, closing, the, primary, bristles, used, for, vegetation, ingestion, are, the, u2, and, l1, fields, dugongs, and, trichechids, differ, in, how, they, use, the, u1, and, u2, bristle, fields, during, feeding, dugongs, use, a, medial, to, lateral, motion, for, u2, bristles, while, trichechids, use, a, prehensile, lateral, to, medial, grasping, motion, these, divergent, feeding, behaviors, allow, dugongs, to, exploit, benthic, foraging, including, rhizome, consumption, more, effectively, than, trichechids, food, handling, was, measured, by, observing, the, length, of, cyclic, movements, feeding, cycles, of, the, manatees, perioral, bristles, used, to, introduce, food, into, their, mouths, mean, feeding, cycle, lengths, varied, based, on, the, manatees, body, size, and, the, species, of, plant, being, consumed, rates, of, food, introduction, derived, from, mean, feeding, cycle, lengths, were, comparable, to, chewing, rates, reported, in, other, studies, manatees, consumed, plants, with, tubular, stems, and, numerous, branches, more, quickly, than, plants, with, flat, blades, food, handling, time, using, perioral, bristles, differed, depending, on, the, species, of, plants, consumed, as, reflected, in, the, mean, feeding, cycle, length, thus, florida, manatees, adapt, their, feeding, behavior, depending, on, the, characteristics, of, the, plants, they, consume, they, exhibit, different, food, handling, strategies, and, efficiencies, based, on, the, plant, species, with, faster, consumption, observed, for, plants, with, tubular, stems, and, numerous, branches, this, research, provides, valuable, insights, into, the, feeding, ecology, dugongs, are, constrained, in, their, feeding, by, their, rudimentary, dentition, and, limited, nitrogen, abundance, in, seagrasses, to, counter, this, they, use, a, strategy, called, cultivation, grazing, this, grazing, can, alter, the, composition, of, seagrass, communities, and, favor, species, early, and, rapidly, growing, species, will, succeed, over, slow, growing, species, oftentimes, these, pioneer, species, can, be, high, in, nitrogen, and, low, in, fibre, making, them, a, preferred, diet, for, the, dugongs, to, ensure, the, abundance, of, favored, seagrasses, dugongs, exhibit, sustained, grazing, pressure, on, seagrass, patches, up, to, a, month, or, more, the, grazing, maximizes, the, presence, of, species, preferred, by, the, dugongs, at, the, expense, of, less, nutritious, and, less, favored, species, this, grazing, method, also, encourages, rapid, recovery, of, seagrass, meadows, the, dugongs, graze, in, meandering, single, trails, that, leave, uncropped, patches, of, seagrass, this, ungrazed, reserve, with, their, surviving, rhizomes, are, key, to, the, expansion, and, restoration, of, seagrasses, seagrasses, respond, to, cropping, by, increasing, nitrogen, levels, and, decreasing, lignin, cultivation, grazing, allows, dugongs, to, increase, both, nutritionally, superior, seagrasses, but, the, overall, nutritional, quality, of, the, seagrasses, by, maintaining, the, seagrasses, in, an, immature, state, dugongs, ensure, the, highest, level, of, nutrition, despite, being, mostly, solitary, sirenians, congregate, in, groups, while, females, are, in, estrus, these, groups, usually, include, one, female, with, multiple, males, sirenians, are, k, selectors, despite, their, longevity, females, give, birth, only, a, few, times, during, their, lives, and, invest, considerable, parental, care, in, their, young, dugongs, generally, gather, in, groups, of, less, than, a, dozen, individuals, for, one, to, two, days, since, they, congregate, in, turbid, waters, little, is, known, about, their, reproductive, behavior, the, males, are, often, seen, with, scars, and, the, tusks, on, dugongs, grow, in, first, for, males, suggesting, they, are, important, in, lekking, they, have, also, been, known, to, lunge, at, each, other, the, age, when, a, female, first, gives, birth, is, disputed, ranging, anywhere, from, 6, to, 17, years, the, time, between, births, is, unclear, with, estimates, ranging, from, 2, to, 7, years, in, sarasota, florida, 53, females, under, observation, produced, at, least, 55, calves, during, a, five, year, period, manatees, can, reach, sexual, maturity, as, early, as, two, to, five, years, of, age, manatee, gestation, is, around, one, year, and, then, they, lactate, for, one, to, two, years, west, indian, manatees, and, african, manatees, can, breed, year, round, and, a, female, will, mate, with, multiple, males, amazonian, manatees, have, a, breeding, season, usually, mating, when, the, river, levels, begin, to, rise, which, varies, from, place, to, place, manatees, may, be, taken, into, captivity, after, being, found, stranded, to, facilitate, their, recovery, and, there, are, many, instances, of, manatees, being, successfully, rehabilitated, and, released, into, the, wild, as, all, extant, sirenian, species, are, rated, as, vulnerable, these, rehabilitation, programs, present, a, useful, means, to, support, these, species, however, the, vulnerability, of, these, animals, also, means, that, the, taking, of, manatees, from, the, wild, for, commercial, purposes, is, a, conservation, issue, manatees, tend, to, do, well, in, a, captive, environment, and, have, been, known, to, thrive, however, it, can, be, difficult, to, replicate, the, conditions, of, their, natural, environment, to, the, extent, necessary, to, maintain, a, manatee, at, its, healthiest, the, typical, diet, fed, to, captive, manatee, populations, may, contain, insufficient, quantities, of, the, nutrients, they, need, manatee, captive, fed, diets, vary, greatly, from, the, manatee, s, diet, in, the, wild, in, captivity, manatees, are, fed, 70, 80, leafy, green, vegetables, 10, 20, dried, forage, and, 5, vegetables, and, fruits, dried, forage, is, foods, such, as, hay, and, timothy, grass, which, are, often, used, as, horse, and, cattle, feed, the, vegetables, and, fruits, that, are, fed, to, manatees, include, romaine, lettuce, carrots, and, apples, in, their, natural, habitat, approximately, half, of, the, manatee, s, diet, is, marine, or, estuarine, plants, when, compared, to, the, captive, diet, aquatic, plants, have, more, dry, matter, and, soluble, neutral, detergent, fiber, and, less, digestible, nutrients, although, more, easily, digestible, nutrients, may, seem, to, represent, a, better, diet, a, manatee, s, gastrointestinal, tract, is, adapted, to, the, wild, diet, through, microbial, processes, of, fermentation, rescue, and, rehabilitation, efforts, often, involve, orphaned, infant, manatees, in, captivity, young, manatees, will, be, bottle, fed, an, amino, acid, based, milk, formula, that, includes, a, protein, source, oils, and, a, stabilizing, agent, this, concoction, is, supplemented, with, vitamins, during, intake, young, manatees, might, require, electrolytes, via, intravenous, hydration, or, even, tube, feeding, if, they, continuously, reject, the, bottle, after, six, months, they, will, be, introduced, to, solid, foods, like, romaine, and, iceberg, lettuce, pumpkin, and, root, vegetables, after, a, year, and, a, half, the, weaning, process, will, begin, and, the, juvenile, manatees, will, be, offered, less, and, less, milk, during, feeding, times, slowly, transitioning, to, a, completely, solid, food, diet, the, three, extant, manatee, species, family, trichechidae, and, the, dugong, family, dugongidae, are, rated, as, vulnerable, on, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, all, four, are, vulnerable, to, extinction, from, habitat, loss, and, other, negative, impacts, related, to, human, population, growth, and, coastal, development, steller, s, sea, cow, extinct, since, 1768, was, hunted, to, extinction, by, humans, the, meat, oil, bones, and, skin, of, manatees, have, commercial, value, in, some, countries, such, as, nigeria, and, cameroon, african, manatees, are, sold, to, zoos, aquariums, and, online, as, pets, sometimes, being, shipped, internationally, though, hunting, of, them, is, illegal, lack, of, law, enforcement, in, these, areas, allows, poaching, some, residents, of, west, african, countries, such, as, mali, and, chad, believe, that, the, oil, of, the, african, manatee, can, cure, ailments, such, as, ear, infections, rheumatism, and, skin, conditions, hunting, is, the, largest, source, of, mortality, in, amazonian, manatees, and, there, are, no, management, plans, except, in, colombia, amazonian, manatees, especially, calves, are, sometimes, illegally, sold, as, pets, but, there, are, several, institutions, that, care, for, and, rescue, these, orphans, with, the, possibility, of, releasing, them, into, the, wild, the, body, parts, of, dugongs, are, used, as, medicinal, remedies, across, the, indian, ocean, manatees, in, cuba, have, faced, poaching, entanglement, and, pollution, the, area, has, some, of, the, most, extensive, and, best, manatee, habitat, in, the, caribbean, but, the, population, has, been, unable, to, thrive, there, existing, information, about, manatees, in, cuba, is, limited, this, makes, it, difficult, to, spread, awareness, which, therefore, enhances, the, risks, of, poaching, and, entanglement, in, fishing, nets, in, coastal, communities, poaching, of, the, manatees, has, been, a, significant, issue, since, the, 1970s, when, it, was, initially, reported, that, the, hunting, was, taking, its, toll, on, the, manatee, population, in, cuba, in, 1975, it, was, reported, that, the, manatees, population, in, cuba, was, rare, and, declining, at, an, alarming, rate, due, to, pollution, and, hunting, in, 1996, manatees, were, placed, under, protection, through, fishery, decree, law, 164, this, law, provided, penalties, against, those, who, manipulate, harm, or, injure, manatees, the, hunting, of, manatees, in, cuba, in, the, 1990s, may, have, been, the, result, of, economic, hardship, with, the, manatees, being, seen, as, a, source, of, protein, although, there, have, been, efforts, made, to, protect, the, population, of, manatees, in, cuba, it, has, not, proven, to, be, effective, as, those, working, to, protect, the, population, had, hoped, many, of, these, areas, are, seen, as, parks, that, exist, only, on, paper, and, they, do, not, have, a, significant, impact, on, conversation, and, protection, environmental, hazards, induced, by, humans, also, puts, sirenians, at, risk, sirenians, especially, the, west, indian, manatee, face, high, mortality, from, watercraft, collision, and, about, half, of, all, west, indian, manatee, deaths, are, caused, by, watercraft, collisions, an, increased, use, of, hydroelectric, power, and, consequent, damming, of, rivers, increase, waterway, traffic, which, can, lead, to, vessel, collisions, and, manatees, may, become, entrapped, in, navigational, locks, the, urbanization, of, the, coastline, of, areas, such, as, the, caribbean, florida, and, australia, can, result, in, a, decline, in, seagrass, populations, seagrass, meadows, are, also, highly, susceptible, to, pollution, and, are, currently, among, the, top, threatened, ecosystems, on, earth, reliable, areas, of, warm, water, in, florida, are, generally, the, result, of, discharge, from, power, plants, but, newer, plants, with, more, efficient, cooling, systems, may, disrupt, the, pattern, of, warm, water, refuges, and, an, increased, demand, on, artesian, springs, the, animals, natural, source, of, warm, water, for, human, use, decreases, the, number, of, warm, water, refuges, congregating, in, the, warm, waters, of, industrial, areas, of, florida, can, expose, manatees, to, pollutants, and, toxins, at, a, time, of, year, when, their, immune, systems, are, already, compromised, sirenians, can, be, caught, as, bycatch, from, fisheries, and, they, can, be, seen, as, pests, that, interfere, with, local, fishermen, and, damage, their, nets, african, manatees, have, also, been, known, to, venture, into, rice, paddies, and, destroy, the, crops, during, the, rainy, season, and, these, confrontations, with, locals, may, lead, to, intentional, killing, of, the, manatees, red, tide, a, harmful, algae, bloom, of, karenia, brevis, that, releases, toxins, into, the, water, kills, many, marine, species, in, 1982, many, manatees, were, sickened, by, consuming, brevetoxins, that, had, accumulated, in, filter, feeding, organisms, attached, to, seagrass, blades, manatees, can, also, inhale, these, brevotoxins, from, the, surface, of, the, water, as, they, come, up, for, air, leading, to, respiratory, symptoms, and, even, drowning, manatee, die, offs, from, exposure, to, red, tide, toxins, were, recorded, by, the, florida, fish, and, wildlife, conservation, commission, in, southwest, florida, in, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, and, 2013, a, 2018, red, tide, bloom, spread, from, pasco, county, to, collier, county, off, the, west, coast, of, florida, as, of, january, 2018, there, were, a, total, of, 472, manatee, deaths, caused, by, this, red, tide, along, with, watercraft, cold, stress, and, other, factors, manatees, have, been, negatively, impacted, by, plastics, and, other, debris, that, makes, its, way, into, the, ocean, and, other, waterways, plastic, and, debris, can, result, in, manatee, entanglement, ingestion, amputation, or, even, death, when, a, manatee, ingests, plastic, it, is, often, not, known, until, after, death, when, a, necropsy, is, conducted, and, debris, is, found, in, the, manatee, s, gi, tract, of, the, 40, antillean, manatees, that, were, rescued, rehabilitated, and, released, by, the, clearwater, marine, aquarium, manatee, reintroduction, program, along, the, central, and, south, american, coast, four, were, found, to, have, plastic, in, their, gi, tract, treatment, was, completed, and, the, manatees, were, released, later, three, of, the, four, were, found, dead, two, as, a, direct, result, of, plastic, ingestion, and, the, third, with, plastic, pieces, in, its, gi, tract, items, found, in, the, deceased, manatees, gi, tracts, included, condoms, plastic, bags, raschel, knit, polyester, unknown, plastic, debris, and, ice, cream, and, sanitary, product, wrappers, a, study, at, the, university, of, miami, in, florida, assessed, 439, manatee, carcasses, that, were, recovered, and, necropsied, between, 1978, and, 1986, of, these, 63, 14, 4, had, ingested, debris, 4, of, the, animals, died, as, a, direct, result, of, ingestion, of, plastic, or, other, debris, some, of, the, debris, that, was, found, in, the, animals, gi, tracts, included, monofilament, fishing, line, the, most, common, item, found, plastic, bags, string, twine, rope, fishhooks, wire, paper, cellophane, synthetic, sponges, rubber, bands, and, stockings, infectious, diseases, may, also, play, an, important, role, in, morbidity, and, mortality, although, viruses, have, been, identified, only, from, florida, manatees, parasites, and, bacteria, have, been, observed, in, at, least, three, of, the, four, sirenian, species, the, viruses, that, have, been, detected, in, florida, manatees, include, trichechid, herpesvirus, 1, trhv, 1, and, manatee, papillomaviruses, tmpv, 1, through, 4, mycobacteriosis, has, reportedly, led, to, mortality, in, captive, florida, manatees, and, illness, in, amazonian, manatees, while, bacteria, such, as, vibrio, pasteurella, pseudomonas, streptococcus, and, clostridium, have, been, cultured, from, dead, dugongs, in, australia, salmonellosis, has, been, associated, with, mortality, in, dugongs, since, at, least, 1981, although, not, well, studied, the, senegal, manatee, is, known, to, host, the, nematode, heterocheilus, tunicatus, just, as, its, sister, species, the, west, indian, manatee, does, there, is, still, a, great, deal, to, learn, about, the, threat, that, infectious, diseases, pose, to, both, wild, and, captive, populations, of, manatees, the, relationship, between, the, presence, of, certain, potential, pathogens, including, those, listed, above, and, their, effect, on, disease, in, individuals, is, still, largely, unknown, although, many, wild, manatees, are, found, to, be, positive, for, papillomavirus, with, no, known, negative, health, effects, immunosuppressed, individuals, that, test, positive, for, papillomavirus, can, sometimes, develop, cutaneous, lesions, however, cutaneous, papillomatosis, is, not, always, correlated, with, a, papillomavirus, infection, and, further, study, is, warranted, in, florida, agricultural, runoff, can, negatively, affect, the, manatee, habitat, and, during, the, rainy, season, over, 50, counties, practice, fertilizer, bans, to, try, to, limit, the, pollutants, that, end, up, in, waterways, weather, disasters, and, other, natural, occurrences, are, also, sources, of, mortality, the, west, indian, manatee, and, dugong, face, risks, from, hurricanes, and, cyclones, which, are, predicted, to, increase, in, the, future, these, storms, can, spread, pollutants, and, may, damage, seagrass, populations, african, manatees, can, become, stranded, during, the, dry, season, when, rivers, and, lakes, become, too, small, or, dry, up, completely, climate, change, is, a, growing, concern, for, manatees, as, changes, in, temperature, can, affect, sea, levels, ph, precipitation, salinity, and, the, circulation, patterns, of, coastal, ecosystems, climate, change, is, also, predicted, to, make, winter, months, even, colder, leading, to, increased, instances, of, cold, stress, in, manatees, manatees, are, known, to, have, an, incredibly, low, metabolic, rate, and, poor, insulation, therefore, it, is, harder, for, them, to, thermoregulate, in, cold, water, conditions, they, typically, will, migrate, to, warmer, waters, once, water, temperatures, start, to, drop, below, 20, degrees, celsius, this, can, include, naturally, warmer, waters, or, artificial, warm, water, habitats, produced, by, power, plants, energy, center, outfalls, manatee, cold, stress, syndrome, can, occur, when, there, is, prolonged, exposure, to, water, temperatures, below, the, 20, degrees, celsius, threshold, which, can, ultimately, result, in, frostbite, like, skin, lesions, anorexia, fat, atrophy, lymphoid, depletion, and, secondary, infections, and, diseases, according, to, the, florida, fish, and, wildlife, conservation, commission, over, the, past, three, years, they, have, documented, the, highest, number, of, cold, related, deaths, to, date, this, a, common, disease, that, is, treated, through, the, manatee, rehabilitation, facilities, in, the, state, of, florida, like, seaworld, orlando, zoo, tampa, at, lowry, park, miami, seaquarium, and, the, jacksonville, zoo, and, gardens, manatee, rehabilitation, for, diseases, like, cold, stress, syndrome, is, possible, through, the, support, of, veterinary, staff, zookeepers, researchers, and, volunteers, in, the, field, the, number, of, manatees, needing, intervention, is, likely, to, rise, as, the, number, of, warm, water, habitats, decrease, due, to, declining, spring, discharges, and, retirement, of, power, plants, common, treatment, therapies, for, manatee, cold, stress, syndrome, can, include, warm, clean, water, antibiotics, rehydration, enemas, and, mineral, oil, for, constipation, and, foreign, debris, and, most, importantly, nutritional, supplementation, for, some, manatee, patients, experiencing, frostbite, like, lesions, long, term, supplementation, may, be, recommended, for, optimal, recovery, those, most, affected, by, cold, stress, syndrome, are, those, recently, weaned, which, can, be, trickier, to, treat, because, of, concerns, surrounding, hypothermia, warming, ocean, temperatures, can, cause, harmful, algal, blooms, which, can, choke, out, the, light, needed, for, growth, of, seagrass, reduced, seagrass, beds, means, that, more, manatees, end, up, congregating, in, smaller, areas, to, feed, increasing, competition, for, resources, and, the, spread, of, pathogens, exposure, to, brevetoxin, during, a, red, tide, event, is, also, a, source, of, mortality, manatees, may, be, exposed, to, brevetoxin, after, a, red, tide, has, subsided, as, it, can, accumulate, on, seagrasses, the, act, of, eating, vegetation, also, stirs, up, sediment, resulting, in, the, ingestion, of, contaminants, trapped, in, the, mud, all, sirenians, are, protected, by, the, us, marine, mammal, protection, act, of, 1972, the, us, endangered, species, act, of, 1973, and, the, convention, on, the, international, trade, in, endangered, species, of, wild, fauna, and, flora, cites, in, addition, to, this, the, four, species, are, further, protected, by, various, specialty, organizations, the, dugong, is, listed, in, the, convention, on, biological, diversity, the, convention, on, migratory, species, and, the, coral, triangle, initiative, in, florida, manatees, are, protected, by, the, florida, manatee, sanctuary, act, of, 1978, which, implements, actions, such, as, the, prohibition, of, watercraft, or, limits, on, their, speeds, where, manatees, exist, marine, mammal, rehabilitation, programs, have, been, underway, and, regulated, in, the, united, states, for, more, than, 40, years, in, 1973, injured, and, distressed, manatees, were, rescued, or, aided, in, florida, eventually, the, program, was, formalized, into, the, manatee, rescue, rehabilitation, and, release, program, managed, by, the, us, fish, and, wildlife, service, in, 2012, the, program, became, the, manatee, rescue, rehabilitation, partnership, with, permitting, and, oversight, by, the, usfws, from, 1973, through, 2014, this, program, rescued, 1, 619, manatees, and, released, 526
