cassowaries, tok, pisin, muruk, indonesian, kasuari, biak, man, suar, bird, strong, papuan, kasu, weri, horned, head, are, flightless, birds, of, the, genus, casuarius, in, the, order, casuariiformes, they, are, classified, as, ratites, flightless, birds, without, a, keel, on, their, sternum, bones, cassowaries, are, native, to, the, tropical, forests, of, new, guinea, western, new, guinea, and, papua, new, guinea, the, moluccas, seram, and, aru, islands, and, northeastern, australia, three, cassowary, species, are, extant, the, most, common, the, southern, cassowary, is, the, third, tallest, and, second, heaviest, living, bird, smaller, only, than, the, ostrich, and, emu, the, other, two, species, are, represented, by, the, northern, cassowary, and, the, dwarf, cassowary, the, northern, cassowary, is, the, most, recently, discovered, and, the, most, threatened, a, fourth, but, extinct, species, is, represented, by, the, pygmy, cassowary, around, 90, of, the, cassowary, diet, consists, of, fruit, although, all, species, are, opportunistic, omnivores, and, take, a, range, of, other, plant, foods, including, shoots, and, grass, seeds, in, addition, to, fungi, eggs, invertebrates, carrion, and, small, vertebrates, like, fish, rodents, small, birds, frogs, lizards, and, snakes, although, all, ratites, can, eat, meat, cassowaries, by, definition, are, the, most, omnivorous, and, predatory, owing, to, having, the, smallest, and, least, herbivorous, gastrointestinal, tract, out, of, any, ratites, that, is, akin, to, true, omnivores, as, well, as, the, fact, that, they, are, one, of, the, only, two, ratites, with, a, recorded, hunting, behaviour, that, is, not, mere, foraging, therefore, despite, being, considered, an, obligate, frugivore, cassowaries, consume, a, considerable, amount, of, protein, throughout, its, life, stages, and, throughout, the, year, hence, cassowaries, are, both, the, largest, fruit, eating, bird, the, largest, omnivorous, bird, and, the, largest, opportunistically, predatory, avian, cassowaries, are, very, wary, of, humans, but, if, provoked, they, are, capable, of, inflicting, serious, even, fatal, injuries, upon, both, dogs, and, people, the, cassowary, has, often, been, labelled, the, world, s, most, dangerous, bird, although, in, terms, of, recorded, statistics, it, pales, in, comparison, to, the, common, ostrich, which, is, recorded, to, kill, two, to, three, humans, per, year, in, south, africa, the, genus, casuarius, was, erected, by, french, scientist, mathurin, jacques, brisson, in, his, ornithologie, published, in, 1760, the, type, species, is, the, southern, cassowary, casuarius, casuarius, the, swedish, naturalist, carl, linnaeus, had, introduced, the, genus, casuarius, in, the, sixth, edition, of, his, systema, naturae, published, in, 1748, but, linnaeus, dropped, the, genus, in, the, important, tenth, edition, of, 1758, and, put, the, southern, cassowary, together, with, the, common, ostrich, and, the, greater, rhea, in, the, genus, struthio, as, the, publication, date, of, linnaeus, s, sixth, edition, was, before, the, 1758, starting, point, of, the, international, commission, on, zoological, nomenclature, brisson, and, not, linnaeus, is, considered, the, authority, for, the, genus, cassowaries, from, malay, kasuari, cognate, of, several, related, languages, spoken, around, the, moluccas, and, new, guinea, are, part, of, the, ratite, group, which, also, includes, the, emu, rheas, ostriches, and, kiwi, as, well, as, the, extinct, moas, and, elephant, birds, these, species, are, recognised, most, authorities, consider, the, taxonomic, classification, above, to, be, monotypic, but, several, subspecies, of, each, have, been, described, and, some, of, them, have, even, been, suggested, as, separate, species, e, g, c, b, papuanus, the, taxonomic, name, c, b, papuanus, also, may, be, in, need, of, revision, to, casuarius, bennetti, westermanni, validation, of, these, subspecies, has, proven, difficult, due, to, individual, variations, age, related, variations, the, scarcity, of, specimens, the, stability, of, specimens, the, bright, skin, of, the, head, and, neck, the, basis, of, describing, several, subspecies, fades, in, specimens, and, the, practice, of, trading, live, cassowaries, for, thousands, of, years, some, of, which, are, likely, to, have, escaped, or, been, deliberately, introduced, to, regions, away, from, their, origin, the, evolutionary, history, of, cassowaries, as, of, all, ratites, is, not, well, known, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, their, closest, living, relatives, are, emus, and, that, the, dwarf, cassowary, is, more, closely, related, to, the, northern, cassowary, than, either, is, to, the, southern, cassowary, a, fossil, species, was, reported, from, australia, but, for, reasons, of, biogeography, this, assignment, is, not, certain, and, it, might, belong, to, the, prehistoric, emuarius, which, was, a, genus, of, cassowary, like, primitive, emus, typically, all, cassowaries, are, shy, birds, that, are, found, in, the, deep, forest, they, are, adept, at, disappearing, long, before, a, human, knows, they, are, there, the, southern, cassowary, of, the, far, north, queensland, rain, forests, is, not, well, studied, and, the, northern, and, dwarf, cassowaries, even, less, so, females, are, larger, and, more, brightly, coloured, than, the, males, adult, southern, cassowaries, are, 1, 5, to, 1, 8, m, 4, ft, 11, in, to, 5, ft, 11, in, tall, although, some, females, may, reach, 2, m, 6, ft, 6, 1, 2, in, and, weigh, 58, 5, kg, 130, lb, however, it, is, not, uncommon, to, see, exceptionally, large, females, topping, the, scales, beyond, 70, kg, 150, lb, with, the, largest, maximum, recorded, being, a, southern, cassowary, at, 85, kg, 187, lb, and, 190, cm, 6, ft, 3, in, tall, hence, by, technicality, all, three, species, of, cassowaries, are, considered, as, asia, s, largest, bird, since, the, extinction, of, the, arabian, ostrich, moreover, not, only, is, the, cassowary, asia, s, largest, bird, within, new, guinea, the, cassowary, is, the, island, s, second, largest, terrestrial, animal, after, the, introduction, of, cervidaes, such, as, the, rusa, deer, chital, and, fallow, deer, all, cassowaries, feathers, consist, of, a, shaft, and, loose, barbules, they, do, not, have, rectrices, tail, feathers, or, a, preen, gland, cassowaries, have, small, wings, with, five, or, six, large, remiges, these, are, reduced, to, stiff, keratinous, quills, resembling, porcupine, quills, with, no, barbs, the, furcula, and, coracoid, are, degenerate, and, their, palatal, bones, and, sphenoid, bones, touch, each, other, these, along, with, their, wedge, shaped, body, are, thought, to, be, adaptations, to, ward, off, vines, thorns, and, saw, edged, leaves, allowing, them, to, run, quickly, through, the, rainforest, unlike, the, majority, of, birds, cassowaries, lack, a, tongue, their, beaks, are, pointed, sharp, and, robust, but, not, serrated, which, allows, them, to, pick, up, fruit, or, small, animals, much, easier, than, the, short, bills, of, an, emu, or, an, ostrich, cassowaries, have, three, toed, feet, with, sharp, claws, the, inner, first, toe, has, a, dagger, like, claw, that, may, be, 125, mm, 5, in, long, this, claw, is, particularly, fearsome, since, cassowaries, sometimes, kick, humans, and, other, animals, with, their, powerful, legs, cassowaries, can, run, at, up, to, 50, km, h, 30, mph, through, the, dense, forest, and, can, jump, up, to, 1, 5, m, 4, ft, 11, in, they, are, good, swimmers, crossing, wide, rivers, and, swimming, in, the, sea, all, three, species, have, a, keratinous, skin, covered, casque, on, their, heads, that, grows, with, age, the, casque, s, shape, and, size, up, to, 18, cm, 7, in, is, species, dependent, c, casuarius, has, the, largest, and, c, bennetti, the, smallest, tricorn, shape, with, c, unappendiculatus, having, variations, in, between, contrary, to, earlier, findings, the, hollow, inside, of, the, casque, is, spanned, with, fine, fibres, several, functions, for, the, casque, have, been, proposed, one, is, that, they, are, a, secondary, sexual, characteristic, other, suggested, functions, include, batting, through, the, underbrush, as, a, weapon, in, dominance, disputes, or, pushing, aside, leaf, litter, during, foraging, the, latter, three, are, disputed, by, biologist, andrew, mack, whose, personal, observation, suggests, that, the, casque, amplifies, deep, sounds, this, is, related, to, a, discovery, that, at, least, the, dwarf, cassowary, and, southern, cassowary, produce, very, low, frequency, sounds, which, may, aid, in, communication, in, dense, rainforests, the, boom, vocalization, that, cassowaries, produce, is, the, lowest, frequency, bird, call, known, and, is, at, the, lower, limit, of, human, hearing, recent, study, suggests, that, casque, acts, as, a, thermal, radiator, offloading, heat, at, high, temperatures, and, restricting, heat, loss, at, low, temperatures, the, average, lifespan, of, wild, cassowaries, is, approximately, 18, 20, years, with, those, held, in, captivity, living, up, to, 40, years, cassowaries, are, solitary, birds, except, during, courtship, egg, laying, and, sometimes, around, ample, food, supplies, males, and, females, each, maintain, separate, territories, that, overlap, of, a, size, of, approximately, 3, square, kilometres, in, one, study, while, females, move, among, satellite, territories, of, different, males, they, appear, to, remain, within, the, same, territories, for, most, of, their, lives, mating, with, the, same, or, closely, related, males, over, the, course, of, their, lives, courtship, and, pair, bonding, rituals, begin, with, the, vibratory, sounds, broadcast, by, females, males, approach, and, run, with, their, necks, parallel, to, the, ground, while, making, dramatic, movements, of, their, heads, which, accentuate, the, frontal, neck, region, the, female, approaches, drumming, slowly, the, male, crouches, on, the, ground, and, the, female, either, steps, on, the, male, s, back, for, a, moment, before, crouching, beside, him, in, preparation, for, copulation, or, she, may, attack, this, is, often, the, case, with, the, females, pursuing, the, males, in, ritualistic, chasing, behaviours, that, generally, terminate, in, water, the, male, cassowary, dives, into, water, and, submerges, himself, up, to, his, upper, neck, and, head, the, female, pursues, him, into, the, water, where, he, eventually, drives, her, to, the, shallows, where, she, crouches, making, ritualistic, motions, of, her, head, the, two, may, remain, in, copulation, for, extended, periods, of, time, in, some, cases, another, male, may, approach, and, run, off, the, first, male, he, will, climb, onto, her, to, copulate, as, well, both, male, and, female, cassowaries, do, not, tolerate, the, presence, of, others, of, the, same, sex, but, females, are, more, prone, to, fight, than, males, which, will, generally, flee, when, encountering, another, male, while, males, and, females, may, also, be, territorial, and, confrontational, this, decreases, during, the, mating, season, the, cassowary, breeding, season, starts, in, may, to, june, females, lay, three, to, eight, large, bright, green, or, pale, green, blue, eggs, in, each, clutch, into, a, heap, of, leaf, litter, prepared, by, the, male, the, eggs, measure, about, 9, by, 14, cm, 3, 5, by, 5, 5, in, only, ostrich, and, emu, eggs, are, larger, the, male, incubates, those, eggs, for, 50, 52, days, removing, or, adding, litter, to, regulate, the, temperature, then, protects, the, chicks, which, stay, in, the, nest, for, about, 9, months, he, defends, them, fiercely, against, all, potential, predators, including, humans, the, young, males, later, go, off, to, find, a, territory, of, their, own, the, female, does, not, care, for, the, eggs, or, the, chicks, but, rather, moves, on, within, her, territory, to, lay, eggs, in, the, nests, of, several, other, males, young, cassowaries, are, brown, and, have, buffy, stripes, they, are, often, kept, as, pets, in, native, villages, in, new, guinea, where, they, are, permitted, to, roam, like, barnyard, fowl, until, nearing, maturity, caged, birds, are, regularly, bereft, of, their, fresh, plumes, cassowaries, as, aforementioned, are, predominantly, frugivorous, but, omnivorous, opportunistically, when, small, prey, is, available, besides, fruits, their, diet, includes, flowers, fungi, snails, insects, frogs, lizards, snakes, birds, fish, rats, mice, small, marsupials, and, carrion, although, their, hunting, of, small, prey, is, more, akin, to, foraging, if, they, could, catch, them, their, diverse, diet, allows, the, cassowary, to, adapt, to, the, availability, of, different, food, sources, in, their, environment, in, case, of, ecological, disruption, despite, their, similar, omnivorous, foraging, behaviour, cassowaries, and, introduced, wild, boars, had, co, existed, for, thousands, of, years, in, new, guinea, even, though, it, should, have, dictated, that, both, species, should, be, in, direct, competition, such, as, in, the, case, in, the, cassowary, population, in, queensland, australia, fruit, from, at, least, 26, plant, families, has, been, documented, in, the, diet, of, cassowaries, fruits, from, the, laurel, podocarp, palm, wild, grape, nightshade, and, myrtle, families, are, important, items, in, the, diet, the, poisonous, cassowary, plum, takes, its, name, from, the, bird, the, bird, avoids, the, poisons, of, these, fruits, due, to, the, presence, of, their, incredibly, short, gastrointestinal, tract, the, shortest, of, all, ratites, in, relation, to, their, size, the, cassowary, s, incredibly, short, and, simple, digestive, tract, leads, to, a, short, gut, retention, time, which, allow, seeds, to, remain, unharmed, during, the, comparatively, soft, digestion, process, and, allows, them, to, consume, fruits, that, contain, toxins, such, as, cyanogens, this, short, gut, length, also, allows, the, birds, to, eat, a, wider, variety, of, protein, source, which, is, unsurprising, given, their, omnivorous, diet, where, trees, are, dropping, fruit, cassowaries, come, in, and, feed, with, each, bird, defending, a, tree, from, others, for, a, few, days, they, move, on, when, the, fruit, is, depleted, fruit, even, items, as, large, as, bananas, and, apples, is, swallowed, whole, cassowaries, are, a, keystone, species, of, rain, forests, because, they, eat, fallen, fruit, whole, and, distribute, seeds, across, the, jungle, floor, via, excrement, adult, and, young, cassowaries, also, practice, corprophagy, as, adult, waste, often, contain, half, digested, fruit, which, still, has, nutritional, value, so, the, birds, would, devour, each, other, s, as, well, as, their, own, droppings, in, more, urbanised, areas, especially, in, queensland, australia, urbanised, cassowaries, have, adopted, to, also, feed, on, picnic, blankets, tables, and, baskets, or, backyard, bird, feeders, and, compost, heaps, thereby, consuming, a, wide, range, of, non, natural, and, non, native, foods, as, well, in, fact, cassowaries, are, known, to, eat, non, edible, items, in, one, case, collection, of, urban, cassowary, droppings, resulted, in, many, unusual, items, outside, of, the, skeletal, remains, of, a, honeyeater, which, was, likely, preyed, by, the, cassowary, researchers, also, found, remains, of, a, child, s, coloured, building, blocks, various, sized, marbles, and, a, very, small, plastic, car, that, came, from, a, cereal, packet, in, terms, of, roadkill, discarded, fish, was, reported, but, the, most, common, type, of, roadkill, eaten, by, cassowaries, are, bandicoots, which, potentially, represent, the, largest, prey, item, consumed, by, the, birds, in, captivity, cassowaries, get, the, majority, of, their, protein, source, from, dog, or, monkey, food, in, fact, captive, cassowaries, consume, almost, a, liter, of, a, protein, source, such, as, dog, food, in, conjunction, with, 19, liters, of, fruit, a, day, which, results, in, 5, of, their, overall, diet, despite, their, largely, frugivorous, lifestyle, some, consider, cassowaries, as, an, apex, species, due, to, the, lack, of, large, terrestrial, predators, in, either, australia, or, new, guinea, forcing, the, birds, to, necessitate, the, role, in, controlling, the, population, of, small, prey, animals, including, other, small, mesopredators, such, as, snakes, and, lizards, if, so, it, would, make, cassowaries, one, of, new, guinea, s, three, terrestrial, apex, predators, with, the, other, two, being, the, crocodile, monitor, and, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, this, would, technically, make, the, cassowary, the, largest, bird, with, minor, predatory, behaviour, since, if, fruit, forms, 90, of, their, diet, or, 5, kg, per, day, in, the, wild, than, the, remaining, 10, or, 500, grams, would, largely, consist, of, prey, material, for, protein, supplementation, in, fact, recent, studies, in, 2013, stated, that, protein, consumption, from, predated, vertebrates, and, invertebrates, was, underestimated, from, previous, investigations, and, that, the, percentage, of, animal, predation, as, part, of, the, cassowary, s, diet, might, be, higher, than, initially, understood, this, underestimation, is, due, to, a, significant, breakdown, of, protein, being, observed, in, the, scat, of, captive, birds, for, example, the, only, remains, of, day, old, chickens, were, body, parts, composed, of, keratin, such, as, feathers, leg, scaling, and, claws, indeed, in, times, of, food, shortage, storm, disruptions, or, changing, seasons, which, result, in, lower, fruit, yield, i, e, winter, and, autumn, the, birds, turn, from, primary, consumer, to, generalist, opportunistic, predators, as, frequent, fecal, examinations, revealed, the, skeletal, remains, of, entire, birds, rodents, and, fish, scales, on, a, constant, basis, new, surveys, and, observations, in, 2019, has, also, shown, that, cassowaries, are, one, of, the, few, ratites, the, other, being, the, equally, elusive, kiwi, with, a, recorded, predator, prey, hunting, behaviour, according, to, ecologists, wren, mclean, when, hunting, for, fish, cassowaries, are, known, to, lower, themselves, in, a, freshwater, pool, and, open, up, their, feathers, they, allow, small, fish, to, come, and, eat, their, dead, skin, cells, once, the, fish, has, been, baited, they, close, their, feathers, which, acts, like, a, net, step, out, of, the, water, shake, themselves, and, then, consume, their, prey, outside, of, fish, the, remains, of, crustaceans, such, as, crabs, are, also, found, in, their, feces, suggesting, that, the, birds, also, actively, hunt, these, animals, as, well, on, occasion, likewise, reports, of, cassowaries, hunting, and, killing, small, mammals, and, lizards, are, quite, common, with, the, birds, often, using, their, feet, to, dig, and, scour, the, forest, floor, for, a, meal, whether, it, is, prey, or, fruit, before, snatching, it, up, with, their, beaks, and, swallowing, them, whole, as, far, as, larger, animals, go, such, as, road, kill, cassowary, beaks, whilst, sharp, aren, t, serrated, like, those, of, a, true, predatory, bird, so, they, can, t, properly, butcher, their, prey, as, such, they, compensate, by, using, their, feet, as, an, anchor, before, grabbing, a, morsel, and, tearing, it, off, with, their, neck, muscles, even, so, cassowaries, will, hunt, larger, prey, if, given, the, opportunity, such, as, in, one, incident, where, an, adult, rooster, killed, an, emerald, dove, by, using, his, sharp, beak, as, a, spear, to, peck, it, to, death, before, butchering, the, remains, for, his, chicks, cassowaries, are, also, known, to, fight, one, another, over, the, opportunity, to, eat, a, dead, animal, suggesting, that, resource, competition, behaviour, between, the, birds, are, common, their, cravings, for, a, high, protein, diet, are, such, that, adult, roosters, with, chicks, are, known, to, supply, their, young, with, a, surprisingly, high, protein, diet, such, as, insects, and, small, birds, such, as, honeyeaters, and, red, browed, finches, with, the, rooster, teaching, their, young, how, to, properly, hunt, and, consume, these, animals, suggesting, that, protein, forms, an, important, dietary, supplement, for, young, cassowaries, nevertheless, cassowary, predatory, behaviour, seem, to, be, seasonal, with, females, expressing, higher, desires, for, meat, during, egg, production, i, e, autumn, and, winter, and, males, expressing, the, same, desires, during, the, pre, breeding, season, and, post, incubation, i, e, autumn, and, spring, this, seasonal, behaviour, changes, allows, the, cassowaries, to, niche, partition, with, new, guinea, s, other, apex, predators, that, also, controls, the, population, of, small, animals, such, as, the, crocodile, monitor, and, the, new, guinea, harpy, eagle, with, the, latter, further, partitioning, by, targeting, arboreal, prey, medium, sized, animals, and, imported, megafauna, on, the, other, hand, like, the, rusa, deer, are, avoided, by, the, birds, as, they, are, completely, incapable, nor, interested, in, hunting, them, instead, larger, prey, animals, are, controlled, by, the, new, guinea, singing, dogs, the, saltwater, crocodile, and, the, new, guinea, crocodile, in, captivity, outside, of, available, hand, fed, processed, protein, source, captive, cassowaries, are, known, to, predate, on, either, live, or, dead, mice, as, well, as, actively, hunt, for, small, birds, and, their, eggs, that, flew, into, their, enclosure, cassowaries, from, the, garner, s, beach, rehabilitation, centre, are, unusually, predatory, beyond, even, non, captive, observations, and, will, eat, protein, almost, exclusively, if, given, the, chance, an, odd, inversion, of, the, usual, frugivorous, lifestyle, in, terms, of, hunting, domesticated, farm, animals, it, is, rare, although, one, was, reported, eating, a, baby, chicken, nevertheless, captive, birds, are, known, to, consume, day, old, chicks, and, butchered, domestic, fowls, from, time, to, time, cassowaries, feed, on, the, fruit, of, several, hundred, rainforest, species, and, usually, pass, viable, seeds, in, large, dense, scats, they, are, known, to, disperse, seeds, over, distances, greater, than, a, kilometre, thus, playing, an, important, role, in, the, ecosystem, germination, rates, for, seeds, of, the, rare, australian, rainforest, tree, ryparosa, were, found, to, be, much, higher, after, passing, through, a, cassowary, s, gut, 92, versus, 4, in, its, main, home, of, new, guinea, cassowaries, are, the, island, s, largest, and, most, dominant, and, formidable, bird, as, well, as, being, one, of, the, largest, terrestrial, endemic, animals, in, new, guinea, as, such, adult, cassowaries, have, no, natural, enemies, other, than, humans, and, even, then, the, birds, are, rarely, hunted, due, to, their, reputation, speed, wariness, and, self, defence, with, juveniles, being, preferred, over, adults, for, ceremonial, purposes, on, average, it, is, considered, very, fortunate, for, a, human, hunter, to, kill, one, in, every, five, years, with, regards, to, their, relationship, with, the, new, guinea, singing, dogs, one, of, papua, s, only, obligate, terrestrial, apex, predator, with, the, other, being, the, crocodile, monitor, adult, birds, generally, ignore, them, with, some, even, believing, that, the, dogs, take, full, advantage, of, the, birds, foraging, behaviour, as, both, species, share, and, use, the, same, feeding, trail, through, the, forests, it, was, believed, that, these, dogs, follow, adult, birds, to, catch, small, prey, attracted, to, the, dropped, fruits, on, the, rainforest, floor, nevertheless, there, was, a, report, from, a, native, hunter, of, an, exceptionally, rare, case, of, a, singing, dog, attacking, the, dwarf, species, the, incident, ended, with, the, singing, dog, being, disemboweled, and, ripped, open, by, the, bird, but, generally, speaking, both, apex, animals, mutually, keep, their, distance, and, avoid, one, another, the, same, cannot, be, said, with, their, chicks, however, as, they, are, vulnerable, to, large, pythons, monitor, lizards, new, guinea, singing, dogs, and, papuan, eagles, when, threaten, it, is, known, that, cassowary, chicks, emit, different, vocalisation, calls, to, indicate, the, specific, threat, such, as, a, hawk, for, example, before, running, underneath, their, father, adult, males, aggressively, defend, their, chicks, while, adult, males, usually, scare, off, or, kill, most, predators, a, chick, will, occasionally, be, separated, in, the, chaos, and, become, a, potential, target, however, in, the, relic, populations, of, north, eastern, australia, the, cassowary, population, faces, threats, from, vehicles, and, are, in, danger, of, being, outcompeted, by, wild, boars, with, their, eggs, being, most, vulnerable, to, boar, predation, their, chicks, also, face, dangers, and, predation, from, domesticated, dogs, which, results, in, a, widespread, decline, in, the, australian, mainland, because, of, such, frequent, inter, species, conflicts, hunting, dogs, are, one, of, the, biggest, enemies, for, cassowaries, and, it, is, not, unheard, of, for, hunting, dogs, to, accidentally, kill, cassowary, chicks, instead, of, feral, pigs, with, the, dogs, in, turn, being, killed, by, the, nearby, adult, rooster, outside, of, threats, from, invasive, species, the, birds, are, also, vulnerable, to, being, unintentionally, poisoned, as, well, rodents, are, a, popular, prey, item, for, the, birds, due, to, their, commonality, ease, of, catch, and, being, a, good, protein, source, however, rodents, that, died, from, rat, poisoning, would, themselves, become, lethal, poison, to, the, birds, which, are, unaware, from, this, contaminated, danger, it, is, unknown, why, the, cassowary, population, in, australia, is, in, decline, as, the, new, guinea, population, has, dealt, with, introduced, wild, boars, dogs, and, feral, cats, for, thousands, of, years, longer, with, little, to, no, impact, on, its, population, suggesting, that, either, the, cassowaries, of, new, guinea, had, long, adapted, to, human, introduced, species, or, that, the, rich, biodiversity, of, new, guinea, allowed, for, additional, niche, partitioning, as, for, eating, the, cassowary, it, is, supposed, to, be, quite, tough, australian, administrative, officers, stationed, in, new, guinea, were, advised, that, it, should, be, cooked, with, a, stone, in, the, pot, when, the, stone, is, ready, to, eat, so, is, the, cassowary, cassowaries, are, native, to, the, humid, rainforests, of, new, guinea, nearby, smaller, islands, east, nusa, tenggara, the, maluku, islands, and, northeastern, australia, they, do, however, venture, out, into, palm, scrub, grassland, savanna, and, swamp, forest, whether, some, island, populations, are, natural, or, the, result, of, human, trade, in, young, birds, is, unclear, they, can, also, be, easily, spotted, in, some, national, parks, such, as, mellwraith, range, national, park, paluma, range, national, park, and, jardine, national, park, in, australia, the, southern, cassowary, is, endangered, in, queensland, kofron, and, chapman, when, they, assessed, the, decline, of, this, species, found, that, of, the, former, cassowary, habitat, only, 20, 25, remains, habitat, loss, and, fragmentation, is, the, primary, cause, of, decline, they, then, studied, 140, cases, of, cassowary, mortality, and, found, that, motor, vehicle, strikes, accounted, for, 55, of, the, deaths, and, dog, attacks, produced, another, 18, remaining, causes, of, death, included, hunting, five, cases, entanglement, in, wire, one, case, the, removal, of, cassowaries, that, attacked, humans, four, cases, and, natural, causes, 18, cases, including, tuberculosis, four, cases, the, cause, for, 14, cases, was, indicated, as, for, unknown, reasons, hand, feeding, cassowaries, poses, a, significant, threat, to, their, survival, because, it, lures, them, into, suburban, areas, there, the, birds, are, more, susceptible, to, encounters, with, vehicles, and, dogs, contact, with, humans, encourages, cassowaries, to, take, food, from, picnic, tables, feral, pigs, also, are, a, significant, threat, to, their, survival, they, destroy, nests, and, eggs, of, cassowaries, but, their, worst, effect, is, as, competitors, for, food, which, may, be, catastrophic, for, the, cassowaries, during, lean, times, in, february, 2011, cyclone, yasi, destroyed, a, large, area, of, cassowary, habitat, endangering, 200, of, the, birds, about, 10, of, the, total, australian, population, the, mission, beach, community, in, far, north, queensland, holds, an, annual, cassowary, festival, in, september, where, funds, are, raised, to, map, the, bird, s, habitat, ironically, despite, being, a, threatened, species, in, queensland, concerns, also, mount, on, cassowaries, being, itself, a, potential, invasive, species, on, the, island, of, tasmania, according, to, the, department, of, primary, industries, parks, water, and, environment, from, hobart, risk, assessments, on, the, cassowary, as, a, potential, invasive, pest, states, that, whilst, the, birds, may, have, trouble, establishing, a, stable, population, on, the, island, they, would, nonetheless, be, considered, a, destructive, element, to, tasmania, s, ecological, diversity, and, recommends, strict, imports, on, these, birds, reasons, are, many, the, most, notable, are, the, birds, size, cassowaries, would, automatically, become, the, island, s, largest, and, most, dominant, terrestrial, animal, that, could, bully, smaller, animals, in, the, same, ecological, niche, frugivores, such, as, the, common, brushtail, possum, common, ringtail, possum, eastern, pygmy, possum, and, the, little, pygmy, possum, would, be, denied, access, to, fruit, of, which, they, depend, upon, however, since, tasmania, lack, the, same, levels, of, fruit, diversity, as, queensland, and, new, guinea, assessments, believe, that, the, birds, would, adapt, by, also, eating, invertebrates, and, small, vertebrates, this, may, lead, to, some, competition, with, the, island, s, endemic, insectivores, such, as, the, eastern, quoll, southern, brown, bandicoot, and, eastern, barred, bandicoot, the, cassowary, has, solitary, habits, and, breeds, less, frequently, in, zoos, than, other, ratites, such, as, ostrich, and, emu, unlike, other, ratites, it, lives, exclusively, in, tropical, rainforest, and, reproducing, this, habitat, carefully, is, essential, unlike, the, emu, which, will, live, with, other, sympatric, species, such, as, kangaroos, in, mixed, australian, fauna, displays, the, cassowary, does, not, cohabit, well, among, its, own, kind, individual, specimens, must, even, be, kept, in, separate, enclosures, due, to, their, solitary, and, aggressive, nature, territoriality, is, one, of, their, most, important, characteristics, the, double, wattled, cassowary, c, casuarius, is, the, most, popular, species, in, captivity, and, it, is, fairly, common, in, european, and, american, zoos, where, it, is, known, for, its, unmistakable, appearance, as, of, 2019, only, weltvogelpark, walsrode, in, germany, has, all, three, species, of, cassowaries, in, its, collection, single, wattled, cassowary, casuarius, unappendiculatus, and, bennett, s, cassowary, casuarius, bennetti, if, subspecies, are, recognised, weltvogelpark, walsrode, has, c, b, westermanni, and, c, u, rufotinctus, there, is, evidence, that, the, cassowary, may, have, been, domesticated, by, humans, thousands, of, years, before, the, chicken, some, new, guinea, highlands, societies, capture, cassowary, chicks, and, raise, them, as, semi, tame, poultry, for, use, in, ceremonial, gift, exchanges, and, as, food, they, are, the, only, indigenous, australasian, animal, known, to, have, been, partly, domesticated, by, people, prior, to, european, arrival, and, colonization, and, by, definition, the, oldest, form, of, domesticated, animal, and, the, largest, domesticated, bird, the, maring, people, of, kundagai, sacrificed, cassowaries, c, bennetti, in, certain, rituals, the, kalam, people, considered, themselves, related, to, cassowaries, and, did, not, classify, them, as, birds, but, as, kin, consequently, they, use, the, pandanus, register, of, the, kalam, language, when, eating, cassowary, meat, studies, on, pleistocene, early, holocene, cassowary, remains, in, papua, suggest, that, indigenous, people, at, the, time, preferred, to, harvest, eggs, rather, than, adults, they, seem, to, have, regulated, their, consumption, of, these, birds, possibly, even, collecting, eggs, and, rearing, young, birds, as, one, of, the, earliest, forms, of, domestication, in, extremely, urbanised, areas, where, cassowaries, used, to, naturally, live, such, as, in, queensland, australia, or, in, port, moresby, papua, new, guinea, the, local, cassowary, population, had, adapted, to, its, less, forested, grounds, increasing, urbanisation, has, increased, the, likelihood, of, human, cassowary, interaction, a, potentially, dangerous, mix, although, cassowary, populations, have, faced, challenges, in, these, urban, areas, in, northeastern, australia, and, parts, of, new, guinea, the, cassowaries, have, proven, to, be, surprisingly, quite, adaptable, in, contrast, to, the, kiwis, of, new, zealand, potentially, making, them, the, largest, urbanised, birds, in, the, world, it, was, found, that, cassowaries, in, these, urban, environments, changed, their, diets, accordingly, with, urbanised, cassowaries, actually, consuming, an, even, greater, proportion, of, fruits, from, exotic, plants, 30, but, still, incorporating, a, significant, proportion, of, fruits, from, native, plants, in, their, diet, likewise, as, aforementioned, the, high, concentration, of, human, activity, in, the, urban, ecology, also, equates, to, a, higher, concentration, of, food, diversity, and, food, waste, with, these, urbanised, cassowaries, foraging, for, food, scraps, bird, feeders, and, outdoor, picnic, food, venues, without, fear, from, humans, or, domesticated, animals, due, to, the, birds, size, and, reputation, due, to, their, omnivorous, nature, cassowaries, are, able, to, eat, all, types, of, human, food, including, processed, ones, if, they, feel, like, it, although, fruit, still, remains, their, favourite, choosings, a, 2013, study, from, post, mortem, investigations, found, that, a, combination, of, fruit, scarcity, and, abundancy, in, human, waste, saw, the, diet, of, the, cassowary, intaking, vast, quantities, of, non, fruit, items, this, include, fungus, carrion, meat, cheese, bones, pasta, chilli, and, tomato, the, high, concentration, of, human, activity, as, well, as, vehicles, mixed, with, domesticated, animals, and, less, forest, coverage, had, also, changed, their, behaviours, these, city, cassowaries, were, shown, to, exist, in, a, higher, state, of, activity, and, rested, less, than, individuals, inhabiting, more, intact, swathes, of, rainforest, actively, moving, between, urban, gardens, and, the, rainforest, the, study, give, evidence, that, these, birds, showed, a, surprising, amount, of, flexible, foraging, strategy, that, has, enabled, them, to, persist, in, rainforest, fragmented, landscapes, cassowaries, have, a, reputation, for, being, dangerous, to, people, and, domestic, animals, during, world, war, ii, american, and, australian, troops, stationed, in, new, guinea, were, warned, to, steer, clear, of, them, in, his, 1958, book, living, birds, of, the, world, ornithologist, ernest, thomas, gilliard, wrote, the, inner, or, second, of, the, three, toes, is, fitted, with, a, long, straight, murderous, nail, which, can, sever, an, arm, or, eviscerate, an, abdomen, with, ease, there, are, many, records, of, natives, being, killed, by, this, bird, this, assessment, of, the, danger, posed, by, cassowaries, has, been, repeated, in, print, by, authors, including, gregory, s, paul, and, jared, diamond, a, 2003, historical, study, of, 221, cassowary, attacks, showed, that, 150, had, been, against, humans, 75, of, these, had, been, from, cassowaries, that, had, been, fed, by, people, 71, of, the, time, the, bird, had, chased, or, charged, the, victim, and, 15, of, the, time, they, kicked, of, the, attacks, 73, involved, the, birds, expecting, or, snatching, food, 5, involved, defending, their, natural, food, sources, 15, involved, defending, themselves, and, 7, involved, defending, their, chicks, or, eggs, only, one, human, death, was, reported, among, those, 150, attacks, the, first, documented, human, death, caused, by, a, cassowary, was, on, april, 6, 1926, in, australia, 16, year, old, phillip, mcclean, and, his, brother, age, 13, came, across, a, cassowary, on, their, property, and, decided, to, try, to, kill, it, by, striking, it, with, clubs, the, bird, kicked, the, younger, boy, who, fell, and, ran, away, as, his, older, brother, struck, the, bird, the, older, mcclean, then, tripped, and, fell, to, the, ground, while, he, was, on, the, ground, the, cassowary, kicked, him, in, the, neck, opening, a, 1, 25, centimetre, 0, 49, in, wound, that, severed, his, jugular, vein, the, boy, died, of, his, injuries, shortly, thereafter, cassowary, strikes, to, the, abdomen, are, among, the, rarest, of, all, but, in, one, case, in, 1995, a, dog, was, kicked, in, the, belly, the, blow, left, no, puncture, but, severe, bruising, occurred, the, dog, later, died, from, an, apparent, intestinal, rupture, another, human, death, due, to, a, cassowary, was, recorded, in, florida, on, april, 12, 2019, the, bird, s, owner, a, 75, year, old, man, who, had, raised, the, animal, was, apparently, clawed, to, death, after, he, fell, to, the, ground
