trilobites, t, r, a, l, b, a, t, s, t, r, l, meaning, three, lobes, are, extinct, marine, arthropods, that, form, the, class, trilobita, trilobites, form, one, of, the, earliest, known, groups, of, arthropods, the, first, appearance, of, trilobites, in, the, fossil, record, defines, the, base, of, the, atdabanian, stage, of, the, early, cambrian, period, 521, million, years, ago, and, they, flourished, throughout, the, lower, paleozoic, before, slipping, into, a, long, decline, when, during, the, devonian, all, trilobite, orders, except, the, proetida, died, out, the, last, trilobites, disappeared, in, the, mass, extinction, at, the, end, of, the, permian, about, 251, 9, million, years, ago, trilobites, were, among, the, most, successful, of, all, early, animals, existing, in, oceans, for, almost, 270, million, years, with, over, 22, 000, species, having, been, described, by, the, time, trilobites, first, appeared, in, the, fossil, record, they, were, already, highly, diversified, and, geographically, dispersed, because, trilobites, had, wide, diversity, and, an, easily, fossilized, mineralised, exoskeleton, they, left, an, extensive, fossil, record, the, study, of, their, fossils, has, facilitated, important, contributions, to, biostratigraphy, paleontology, evolutionary, biology, and, plate, tectonics, trilobites, are, placed, within, the, clade, artiopoda, which, includes, many, organisms, that, are, morphologically, similar, to, trilobites, but, are, largely, unmineralised, the, relationship, of, artiopoda, to, other, arthropods, is, uncertain, trilobites, evolved, into, many, ecological, niches, some, moved, over, the, seabed, as, predators, scavengers, or, filter, feeders, and, some, swam, feeding, on, plankton, some, even, crawled, onto, land, most, lifestyles, expected, of, modern, marine, arthropods, are, seen, in, trilobites, with, the, possible, exception, of, parasitism, where, scientific, debate, continues, some, trilobites, particularly, the, family, olenidae, are, even, thought, to, have, evolved, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, sulfur, eating, bacteria, from, which, they, derived, food, the, largest, trilobites, were, more, than, 70, centimetres, 28, in, long, and, may, have, weighed, as, much, as, 4, 5, kilograms, 9, 9, lb, trilobites, belong, to, the, artiopoda, a, group, of, extinct, arthropods, morphologically, similar, to, trilobites, though, only, the, trilobites, had, mineralised, exoskeletons, thus, other, artiopodans, are, typically, only, found, in, exceptionally, preserved, deposits, mostly, during, the, cambrian, period, the, exact, relationships, of, artiopods, to, other, arthropods, is, uncertain, they, have, been, considered, closely, related, to, chelicerates, which, include, horseshoe, crabs, and, arachnids, as, part, of, a, clade, called, arachnomorpha, while, others, consider, them, to, be, more, closely, related, to, mandibulata, which, contains, insects, crustaceans, and, myriapods, as, part, of, a, clade, called, antennulata, the, earliest, trilobites, known, from, the, fossil, record, are, redlichiids, and, ptychopariid, bigotinids, dated, to, around, 520, million, years, ago, contenders, for, the, earliest, trilobites, include, profallotaspis, jakutensis, siberia, fritzaspis, spp, western, usa, hupetina, antiqua, morocco, and, serrania, gordaensis, spain, trilobites, appeared, at, a, roughly, equivalent, time, in, laurentia, siberia, and, west, gondwana, all, olenellina, lack, facial, sutures, see, below, and, this, is, thought, to, represent, the, original, state, the, earliest, sutured, trilobite, found, so, far, lemdadella, occurs, almost, at, the, same, time, as, the, earliest, olenellina, suggesting, the, trilobites, origin, lies, before, the, start, of, the, atdabanian, but, without, leaving, fossils, other, groups, show, secondary, lost, facial, sutures, such, as, all, agnostina, and, some, phacopina, another, common, feature, of, the, olenellina, also, suggests, this, suborder, to, be, the, ancestral, trilobite, stock, early, protaspid, stages, have, not, been, found, supposedly, because, these, were, not, calcified, and, this, also, is, supposed, to, represent, the, original, state, earlier, trilobites, may, be, found, and, could, shed, more, light, on, their, origins, three, specimens, of, a, trilobite, from, morocco, megistaspis, hammondi, dated, 478, million, years, old, contain, fossilized, soft, parts, in, 2024, researchers, discovered, soft, tissues, and, other, structures, including, the, labrum, in, well, preserved, trilobite, specimens, from, cambrian, stage, 4, of, morocco, providing, new, anatomical, information, regarding, the, external, and, internal, morphology, of, trilobites, and, the, cause, of, such, extraordinary, preservation, is, probably, due, to, their, rapid, death, after, an, underwater, pyroclastic, flow, trilobites, saw, great, diversification, over, time, for, such, a, long, lasting, group, of, animals, it, is, no, surprise, that, trilobite, evolutionary, history, is, marked, by, a, number, of, extinction, events, where, some, groups, perished, and, surviving, groups, diversified, to, fill, ecological, niches, with, comparable, or, unique, adaptations, generally, trilobites, maintained, high, diversity, levels, throughout, the, cambrian, and, ordovician, periods, before, entering, a, drawn, out, decline, in, the, devonian, culminating, in, the, final, extinction, of, the, last, few, survivors, at, the, end, of, the, permian, period, principal, evolutionary, trends, from, primitive, morphologies, such, as, exemplified, by, eoredlichia, include, the, origin, of, new, types, of, eyes, improvement, of, enrollment, and, articulation, mechanisms, increased, size, of, pygidium, micropygy, to, isopygy, and, development, of, extreme, spinosity, in, certain, groups, changes, also, included, narrowing, of, the, thorax, and, increasing, or, decreasing, numbers, of, thoracic, segments, specific, changes, to, the, cephalon, are, also, noted, variable, glabella, size, and, shape, position, of, eyes, and, facial, sutures, and, hypostome, specialization, several, morphologies, appeared, independently, within, different, major, taxa, e, g, eye, reduction, or, miniaturization, effacement, the, loss, of, surface, detail, in, the, cephalon, pygidium, or, the, thoracic, furrows, is, also, a, common, evolutionary, trend, notable, examples, of, this, were, the, orders, agnostida, and, asaphida, and, the, suborder, illaenina, of, the, corynexochida, effacement, is, believed, to, be, an, indication, of, either, a, burrowing, lifestyle, or, a, pelagic, one, effacement, poses, a, problem, for, taxonomists, since, the, loss, of, details, particularly, of, the, glabella, can, make, the, determination, of, phylogenetic, relationships, difficult, although, it, has, historically, been, suggested, that, trilobites, originated, during, the, precambrian, this, is, no, longer, supported, and, it, is, thought, that, trilobites, originated, shortly, before, they, appeared, in, the, fossil, record, very, shortly, after, trilobite, fossils, appeared, in, the, lower, cambrian, they, rapidly, diversified, into, the, major, orders, that, typified, the, cambrian, redlichiida, ptychopariida, agnostida, and, corynexochida, the, first, major, crisis, in, the, trilobite, fossil, record, occurred, in, the, middle, cambrian, surviving, orders, developed, isopygius, or, macropygius, bodies, and, developed, thicker, cuticles, allowing, better, defense, against, predators, see, thorax, below, the, end, cambrian, mass, extinction, event, marked, a, major, change, in, trilobite, fauna, almost, all, redlichiida, including, the, olenelloidea, and, most, late, cambrian, stocks, became, extinct, a, continuing, decrease, in, laurentian, continental, shelf, area, is, recorded, at, the, same, time, as, the, extinctions, suggesting, major, environmental, upheaval, notable, trilobite, genera, appearing, in, the, cambrian, include, the, early, ordovician, is, marked, by, vigorous, radiations, of, articulate, brachiopods, bryozoans, bivalves, echinoderms, and, graptolites, with, many, groups, appearing, in, the, fossil, record, for, the, first, time, although, intra, species, trilobite, diversity, seems, to, have, peaked, during, the, cambrian, trilobites, were, still, active, participants, in, the, ordovician, radiation, event, with, a, new, fauna, taking, over, from, the, old, cambrian, one, phacopida, and, trinucleioidea, are, characteristic, forms, highly, differentiated, and, diverse, most, with, uncertain, ancestors, the, phacopida, and, other, new, clades, almost, certainly, had, cambrian, forebears, but, the, fact, that, they, have, avoided, detection, is, a, strong, indication, that, novel, morphologies, were, developing, very, rapidly, changes, within, the, trilobite, fauna, during, the, ordovician, foreshadowed, the, mass, extinction, at, the, end, of, the, ordovician, allowing, many, families, to, continue, into, the, silurian, with, little, disturbance, ordovician, trilobites, were, successful, at, exploiting, new, environments, notably, reefs, the, ordovician, mass, extinction, did, not, leave, the, trilobites, unscathed, some, distinctive, and, previously, successful, forms, such, as, the, telephinidae, and, agnostida, became, extinct, the, ordovician, marks, the, last, great, diversification, period, amongst, the, trilobites, very, few, entirely, new, patterns, of, organisation, arose, post, ordovician, later, evolution, in, trilobites, was, largely, a, matter, of, variations, upon, the, ordovician, themes, by, the, ordovician, mass, extinction, vigorous, trilobite, radiation, has, stopped, and, gradual, decline, is, foreshadowed, some, of, the, genera, of, trilobites, appearing, in, the, ordovician, include, most, early, silurian, families, constitute, a, subgroup, of, the, late, ordovician, fauna, few, if, any, of, the, dominant, early, ordovician, fauna, survived, to, the, end, of, the, ordovician, yet, 74, of, the, dominant, late, ordovician, trilobite, fauna, survived, the, ordovician, late, ordovician, survivors, account, for, all, post, ordovician, trilobite, groups, except, the, harpetida, silurian, and, devonian, trilobite, assemblages, are, superficially, similar, to, ordovician, assemblages, dominated, by, lichida, and, phacopida, including, the, well, known, calymenina, a, number, of, characteristic, forms, do, not, extend, far, into, the, devonian, and, almost, all, the, remainder, were, wiped, out, by, a, series, of, dramatic, middle, and, late, devonian, extinctions, three, orders, and, all, but, five, families, were, exterminated, by, the, combination, of, sea, level, changes, and, a, break, in, the, redox, equilibrium, a, meteorite, impact, has, also, been, suggested, as, a, cause, only, a, single, order, the, proetida, survived, into, the, carboniferous, genera, of, trilobites, during, the, silurian, and, devonian, periods, include, the, proetida, survived, for, millions, of, years, continued, through, the, carboniferous, period, and, lasted, until, the, end, of, the, permian, when, the, vast, majority, of, species, on, earth, were, wiped, out, it, is, unknown, why, the, order, proetida, alone, survived, the, devonian, the, proetida, maintained, relatively, diverse, faunas, in, both, deep, and, shallow, water, shelf, environments, throughout, the, carboniferous, for, many, millions, of, years, the, proetida, existed, untroubled, in, their, ecological, niche, an, analogy, would, be, today, s, crinoids, which, mostly, exist, as, deep, water, species, in, the, paleozoic, era, vast, forests, of, crinoids, lived, in, shallow, near, shore, environments, some, of, the, genera, of, trilobites, during, the, carboniferous, and, permian, periods, include, exactly, why, the, trilobites, became, extinct, is, not, clear, with, repeated, extinction, events, often, followed, by, apparent, recovery, throughout, the, trilobite, fossil, record, a, combination, of, causes, is, likely, after, the, extinction, event, at, the, end, of, the, devonian, period, what, trilobite, diversity, remained, was, bottlenecked, into, the, order, proetida, decreasing, diversity, of, genera, limited, to, shallow, water, shelf, habitats, coupled, with, a, drastic, lowering, of, sea, level, regression, meant, that, the, final, decline, of, trilobites, happened, shortly, before, the, end, permian, mass, extinction, event, with, so, many, marine, species, involved, in, the, permian, extinction, the, end, of, nearly, 300, million, successful, years, for, the, trilobites, would, not, have, been, unexpected, at, the, time, trilobites, appear, to, have, been, primarily, marine, organisms, since, the, fossilized, remains, of, trilobites, are, always, found, in, rocks, containing, fossils, of, other, salt, water, animals, such, as, brachiopods, crinoids, and, corals, some, trackways, suggest, trilobites, made, at, least, temporary, excursions, unto, land, within, the, marine, paleoenvironment, trilobites, were, found, in, a, broad, range, from, extremely, shallow, water, to, very, deep, water, trilobites, like, brachiopods, crinoids, and, corals, are, found, on, all, modern, continents, and, occupied, every, ancient, ocean, from, which, paleozoic, fossils, have, been, collected, the, remnants, of, trilobites, can, range, from, the, preserved, body, to, pieces, of, the, exoskeleton, which, it, shed, in, the, process, known, as, ecdysis, in, addition, the, tracks, left, behind, by, trilobites, living, on, the, sea, floor, are, often, preserved, as, trace, fossils, there, are, three, main, forms, of, trace, fossils, associated, with, trilobites, rusophycus, cruziana, and, diplichnites, such, trace, fossils, represent, the, preserved, life, activity, of, trilobites, active, upon, the, sea, floor, rusophycus, the, resting, trace, are, trilobite, excavations, involving, little, or, no, forward, movement, and, ethological, interpretations, suggest, resting, protection, and, hunting, cruziana, the, feeding, trace, are, furrows, through, the, sediment, which, are, believed, to, represent, the, movement, of, trilobites, while, deposit, feeding, many, of, the, diplichnites, fossils, are, believed, to, be, traces, made, by, trilobites, walking, on, the, sediment, surface, care, must, be, taken, as, similar, trace, fossils, are, recorded, in, freshwater, and, post, paleozoic, deposits, representing, non, trilobite, origins, trilobite, fossils, are, found, worldwide, with, thousands, of, known, species, because, they, appeared, quickly, in, geological, time, and, moulted, like, other, arthropods, trilobites, serve, as, excellent, index, fossils, enabling, geologists, to, date, the, age, of, the, rocks, in, which, they, are, found, they, were, among, the, first, fossils, to, attract, widespread, attention, and, new, species, are, being, discovered, every, year, in, the, united, states, the, best, open, to, the, public, collection, of, trilobites, is, located, in, hamburg, new, york, the, shale, quarry, informally, known, as, penn, dixie, stopped, mining, in, the, 1960s, the, large, amounts, of, trilobites, were, discovered, in, the, 1970s, by, dan, cooper, as, a, well, known, rock, collector, he, incited, scientific, and, public, interest, in, the, location, the, fossils, are, dated, to, the, givetian, 387, 2, 382, 7, million, years, ago, when, the, western, new, york, region, was, 30, degrees, south, of, the, equator, and, completely, covered, in, water, the, site, was, purchased, from, vincent, c, bonerb, by, the, town, of, hamburg, with, the, cooperation, of, the, hamburg, natural, history, society, to, protect, the, land, from, development, in, 1994, the, quarry, became, penn, dixie, fossil, park, nature, reserve, when, they, received, 501, c, 3, status, and, was, opened, for, visitation, and, collection, of, trilobite, samples, the, two, most, common, found, samples, are, eldredgeops, rana, and, greenops, a, famous, location, for, trilobite, fossils, in, the, united, kingdom, is, wren, s, nest, dudley, in, the, west, midlands, where, calymene, blumenbachii, is, found, in, the, silurian, wenlock, group, this, trilobite, is, featured, on, the, town, s, coat, of, arms, and, was, named, the, dudley, bug, or, dudley, locust, by, quarrymen, who, once, worked, the, now, abandoned, limestone, quarries, llandrindod, wells, powys, wales, is, another, famous, trilobite, location, the, well, known, elrathia, kingi, trilobite, is, found, in, abundance, in, the, cambrian, wheeler, shale, of, utah, spectacularly, preserved, trilobite, fossils, often, showing, soft, body, parts, legs, gills, antennae, etc, have, been, found, in, british, columbia, canada, the, cambrian, burgess, shale, and, similar, localities, new, york, u, s, a, ordovician, walcott, rust, quarry, near, russia, and, beecher, s, trilobite, bed, near, rome, china, lower, cambrian, maotianshan, shales, near, chengjiang, germany, the, devonian, hunsr, ck, slates, near, bundenbach, and, much, more, rarely, in, trilobite, bearing, strata, in, utah, wheeler, shale, and, other, formations, ontario, and, manuels, river, newfoundland, and, labrador, sites, in, morocco, also, yield, very, well, preserved, trilobites, many, buried, in, mudslides, alive, and, so, perfectly, preserved, an, industry, has, developed, around, their, recovery, leading, to, controversies, about, practices, in, restoral, the, variety, of, eye, and, upper, body, forms, and, fragile, protuberances, is, best, known, from, these, samples, preserved, similarly, to, bodies, in, pompeii, the, french, palaeontologist, joachim, barrande, 1799, 1883, carried, out, his, landmark, study, of, trilobites, in, the, cambrian, ordovician, and, silurian, of, bohemia, publishing, the, first, volume, of, syst, me, silurien, du, centre, de, la, boh, me, in, 1852, the, study, of, paleozoic, trilobites, in, the, welsh, english, borders, by, niles, eldredge, was, fundamental, in, formulating, and, testing, punctuated, equilibrium, as, a, mechanism, of, evolution, identification, of, the, atlantic, and, pacific, trilobite, faunas, in, north, america, and, europe, implied, the, closure, of, the, iapetus, ocean, producing, the, iapetus, suture, thus, providing, important, supporting, evidence, for, the, theory, of, continental, drift, trilobites, have, been, important, in, estimating, the, rate, of, speciation, during, the, period, known, as, the, cambrian, explosion, because, they, are, the, most, diverse, group, of, metazoans, known, from, the, fossil, record, of, the, early, cambrian, trilobites, are, excellent, stratigraphic, markers, of, the, cambrian, period, researchers, who, find, trilobites, with, alimentary, prosopon, and, a, micropygium, have, found, early, cambrian, strata, most, of, the, cambrian, stratigraphy, is, based, on, the, use, of, trilobite, marker, fossils, trilobites, are, the, state, fossils, of, ohio, isotelus, wisconsin, calymene, celebra, and, pennsylvania, phacops, rana, the, 10, most, commonly, recognized, trilobite, orders, are, agnostida, redlichiida, corynexochida, lichida, odontopleurida, phacopida, proetida, asaphida, harpetida, and, ptychopariida, in, 2020, an, 11th, order, trinucleida, was, proposed, to, be, elevated, out, of, the, asaphid, superfamily, trinucleioidea, sometimes, the, nektaspida, are, considered, trilobites, but, these, lack, a, calcified, exoskeleton, and, eyes, some, scholars, have, proposed, that, the, order, agnostida, is, polyphyletic, with, the, suborder, agnostina, representing, non, trilobite, arthropods, unrelated, to, the, suborder, eodiscina, under, this, hypothesis, eodiscina, would, be, elevated, to, a, new, order, eodiscida, over, 20, 000, species, of, trilobite, have, been, described, despite, their, rich, fossil, record, with, thousands, of, described, genera, found, throughout, the, world, the, taxonomy, and, phylogeny, of, trilobites, have, many, uncertainties, except, possibly, for, the, members, of, the, orders, phacopida, and, lichida, which, first, appear, during, the, early, ordovician, nine, of, the, eleven, trilobite, orders, appear, prior, to, the, end, of, the, cambrian, most, scientists, believe, that, order, redlichiida, more, specifically, its, suborder, redlichiina, contains, a, common, ancestor, of, all, other, orders, with, the, possible, exception, of, the, agnostina, while, many, potential, phylogenies, are, found, in, the, literature, most, have, suborder, redlichiina, giving, rise, to, orders, corynexochida, and, ptychopariida, during, the, lower, cambrian, and, the, lichida, descending, from, either, the, redlichiida, or, corynexochida, in, the, middle, cambrian, order, ptychopariida, is, the, most, problematic, order, for, trilobite, classification, in, the, 1959, treatise, on, invertebrate, paleontology, what, are, now, members, of, orders, ptychopariida, asaphida, proetida, and, harpetida, were, grouped, together, as, order, ptychopariida, subclass, librostoma, was, erected, in, 1990, to, encompass, all, of, these, orders, based, on, their, shared, ancestral, character, of, a, natant, unattached, hypostome, the, most, recently, recognized, of, the, nine, trilobite, orders, harpetida, was, erected, in, 2002, the, progenitor, of, order, phacopida, is, unclear, when, trilobites, are, found, only, the, exoskeleton, is, preserved, often, in, an, incomplete, state, in, all, but, a, handful, of, locations, a, few, locations, lagerst, tten, preserve, identifiable, soft, body, parts, legs, gills, musculature, digestive, tract, and, enigmatic, traces, of, other, structures, e, g, fine, details, of, eye, structure, as, well, as, the, exoskeleton, of, the, 20, 000, known, species, only, 38, have, fossils, with, preserved, appendages, trilobites, range, in, length, from, minute, less, than, 1, millimetre, 0, 039, in, to, very, large, over, 70, centimetres, 28, in, with, an, average, size, range, of, 3, 10, cm, 1, 2, 3, 9, in, supposedly, the, smallest, species, is, acanthopleurella, stipulae, with, a, maximum, of, 1, 5, millimetres, 0, 059, in, the, world, s, largest, known, trilobite, specimen, assigned, to, isotelus, rex, is, 72, cm, 28, in, in, length, it, was, found, in, 1998, by, canadian, scientists, in, ordovician, rocks, on, the, shores, of, hudson, bay, however, a, partial, specimen, of, the, ordovician, trilobite, hungioides, bohemicus, found, in, 2009, in, arouca, portugal, is, estimated, to, have, measured, when, complete, 86, 5, cm, 34, 1, in, in, length, only, the, upper, dorsal, part, of, their, exoskeleton, is, mineralized, composed, of, calcite, and, calcium, phosphate, minerals, in, a, lattice, of, chitin, and, is, curled, round, the, lower, edge, to, produce, a, small, fringe, called, the, doublure, their, appendages, and, soft, underbelly, were, non, mineralized, three, distinctive, tagmata, sections, are, present, cephalon, head, thorax, body, and, pygidium, tail, as, might, be, expected, for, a, group, of, animals, comprising, c, 5, 000, genera, the, morphology, and, description, of, trilobites, can, be, complex, despite, morphological, complexity, and, an, unclear, position, within, higher, classifications, there, are, a, number, of, characteristics, which, distinguish, the, trilobites, from, other, arthropods, a, generally, sub, elliptical, dorsal, chitinous, exoskeleton, divided, longitudinally, into, three, distinct, lobes, from, which, the, group, gets, its, name, having, a, distinct, relatively, large, head, shield, cephalon, articulating, axially, with, a, thorax, comprising, articulated, transverse, segments, the, hindmost, of, which, are, almost, invariably, fused, to, form, a, tail, shield, pygidium, when, describing, differences, between, trilobite, taxa, the, presence, size, and, shape, of, the, cephalic, features, are, often, mentioned, during, moulting, the, exoskeleton, generally, splits, between, the, head, and, thorax, which, is, why, so, many, trilobite, fossils, are, missing, one, or, the, other, in, most, groups, facial, sutures, on, the, cephalon, helped, facilitate, moulting, similar, to, lobsters, and, crabs, trilobites, would, have, physically, grown, between, the, moult, stage, and, the, hardening, of, the, new, exoskeleton, a, trilobite, s, cephalon, or, head, section, is, highly, variable, with, a, lot, of, morphological, complexity, the, glabella, forms, a, dome, underneath, which, sat, the, crop, or, stomach, generally, the, exoskeleton, has, few, distinguishing, ventral, features, but, the, cephalon, often, preserves, muscle, attachment, scars, and, occasionally, the, hypostome, a, small, rigid, plate, comparable, to, the, ventral, plate, in, other, arthropods, a, toothless, mouth, and, stomach, sat, upon, the, hypostome, with, the, mouth, facing, backward, at, the, rear, edge, of, the, hypostome, hypostome, morphology, is, highly, variable, sometimes, supported, by, an, un, mineralised, membrane, natant, sometimes, fused, onto, the, anterior, doublure, with, an, outline, very, similar, to, the, glabella, above, conterminant, or, fused, to, the, anterior, doublure, with, an, outline, significantly, different, from, the, glabella, impendent, many, variations, in, shape, and, placement, of, the, hypostome, have, been, described, the, size, of, the, glabella, and, the, lateral, fringe, of, the, cephalon, together, with, hypostome, variation, have, been, linked, to, different, lifestyles, diets, and, specific, ecological, niches, the, anterior, and, lateral, fringe, of, the, cephalon, is, greatly, enlarged, in, the, harpetida, in, other, species, a, bulge, in, the, pre, glabellar, area, is, preserved, that, suggests, a, brood, pouch, highly, complex, compound, eyes, are, another, obvious, feature, of, the, cephalon, facial, or, cephalic, sutures, are, the, natural, fracture, lines, in, the, cephalon, of, trilobites, their, function, was, to, assist, the, trilobite, in, shedding, its, old, exoskeleton, during, ecdysis, or, molting, all, species, assigned, to, the, suborder, olenellina, that, became, extinct, at, the, very, end, of, the, early, cambrian, like, fallotaspis, nevadia, judomia, and, olenellus, lacked, facial, sutures, they, are, believed, to, have, never, developed, facial, sutures, having, pre, dated, their, evolution, because, of, this, along, with, other, primitive, characteristics, they, are, thought, to, be, the, earliest, ancestors, of, later, trilobites, some, other, later, trilobites, also, lost, facial, sutures, secondarily, the, type, of, sutures, found, in, different, species, are, used, extensively, in, the, taxonomy, and, phylogeny, of, trilobites, the, dorsal, surface, of, the, trilobite, cephalon, the, frontmost, tagma, or, the, head, can, be, divided, into, two, regions, the, cranidium, and, the, librigena, free, cheeks, the, cranidium, can, be, further, divided, into, the, glabella, the, central, lobe, in, the, cephalon, and, the, fixigena, fixed, cheeks, the, facial, sutures, lie, along, the, anterior, edge, at, the, division, between, the, cranidium, and, the, librigena, trilobite, facial, sutures, on, the, dorsal, side, can, be, roughly, divided, into, five, main, types, according, to, where, the, sutures, end, relative, to, the, genal, angle, the, edges, where, the, side, and, rear, margins, of, the, cephalon, converge, the, primitive, state, of, the, dorsal, sutures, is, proparian, opisthoparian, sutures, have, developed, several, times, independently, there, are, no, examples, of, proparian, sutures, developing, in, taxa, with, opisthoparian, ancestry, trilobites, that, exhibit, opisthoparian, sutures, as, adults, commonly, have, proparian, sutures, as, instars, known, exceptions, being, yunnanocephalus, and, duyunaspis, hypoparian, sutures, have, also, arisen, independently, in, several, groups, of, trilobites, the, course, of, the, facial, sutures, from, the, front, of, the, visual, surface, varies, at, least, as, strongly, as, it, does, in, the, rear, but, the, lack, of, a, clear, reference, point, similar, to, the, genal, angle, makes, it, difficult, to, categorize, one, of, the, more, pronounced, states, is, that, the, front, of, the, facial, sutures, do, not, cut, the, lateral, or, frontal, border, on, its, own, but, coincide, in, front, of, the, glabella, and, cut, the, frontal, border, at, the, midline, this, is, inter, alia, the, case, in, the, asaphida, even, more, pronounced, is, the, situation, that, the, frontal, branches, of, the, facial, sutures, end, in, each, other, resulting, in, yoked, free, cheeks, this, is, known, in, triarthrus, and, in, the, phacopidae, but, in, that, family, the, facial, sutures, are, not, functional, as, can, be, concluded, from, the, fact, that, free, cheeks, are, not, found, separated, from, the, cranidium, there, are, also, two, types, of, sutures, in, the, dorsal, surface, connected, to, the, compound, eyes, of, trilobites, they, are, dorsal, facial, sutures, continue, downward, to, the, ventral, side, of, the, cephalon, where, they, become, the, connective, sutures, that, divide, the, doublure, the, following, are, the, types, of, ventral, sutures, the, rostrum, or, the, rostral, plate, is, a, distinct, part, of, the, doublure, located, at, the, front, of, the, cephalon, it, is, separated, from, the, rest, of, the, doublure, by, the, rostral, suture, during, molting, in, trilobites, like, paradoxides, the, rostrum, is, used, to, anchor, the, front, part, of, the, trilobite, as, the, cranidium, separates, from, the, librigena, the, opening, created, by, the, arching, of, the, body, provides, an, exit, for, the, molting, trilobite, it, is, absent, in, some, trilobites, like, lachnostoma, the, hypostome, is, the, hard, mouthpart, of, the, trilobite, found, on, the, ventral, side, of, the, cephalon, typically, below, the, glabella, the, hypostome, can, be, classified, into, three, types, based, on, whether, they, are, permanently, attached, to, the, rostrum, or, not, and, whether, they, are, aligned, to, the, anterior, dorsal, tip, of, the, glabella, the, thorax, is, a, series, of, articulated, segments, that, lie, between, the, cephalon, and, pygidium, the, number, of, segments, varies, between, 2, and, 103, with, most, species, in, the, 2, to, 16, range, each, segment, consists, of, the, central, axial, ring, and, the, outer, pleurae, which, protected, the, limbs, and, gills, the, pleurae, are, sometimes, abbreviated, or, extended, to, form, long, spines, apodemes, are, bulbous, projections, on, the, ventral, surface, of, the, exoskeleton, to, which, most, leg, muscles, attached, although, some, leg, muscles, attached, directly, to, the, exoskeleton, determining, a, junction, between, thorax, and, pygidium, can, be, difficult, and, many, segment, counts, suffer, from, this, problem, trilobite, fossils, are, often, found, enrolled, curled, up, like, modern, pill, bugs, for, protection, evidence, suggests, enrollment, volvation, helped, protect, against, the, inherent, weakness, of, the, arthropod, cuticle, that, was, exploited, by, anomalocarid, predators, the, earliest, evidence, of, volvation, is, a, little, over, 510, million, years, old, and, has, been, found, in, olenellidae, but, these, forms, didn, t, have, any, of, the, interlocking, mechanisms, found, in, later, trilobites, some, trilobites, achieved, a, fully, closed, capsule, e, g, phacops, while, others, with, long, pleural, spines, e, g, selenopeltis, left, a, gap, at, the, sides, or, those, with, a, small, pygidium, e, g, paradoxides, left, a, gap, between, the, cephalon, and, pygidium, in, phacops, the, pleurae, overlap, a, smooth, bevel, facet, allowing, a, close, seal, with, the, doublure, the, doublure, carries, a, panderian, notch, or, protuberance, on, each, segment, to, prevent, over, rotation, and, achieve, a, good, seal, even, in, an, agnostid, with, only, 2, articulating, thoracic, segments, the, process, of, enrollment, required, a, complex, musculature, to, contract, the, exoskeleton, and, return, to, the, flat, condition, the, pygidium, is, formed, from, a, number, of, segments, and, the, telson, fused, together, segments, in, the, pygidium, are, similar, to, the, thoracic, segments, bearing, biramous, limbs, but, are, not, articulated, trilobites, can, be, described, based, on, the, pygidium, being, micropygous, pygidium, smaller, than, cephalon, subisopygous, pygidium, sub, equal, to, cephalon, isopygous, pygidium, equal, in, size, to, cephalon, or, macropygous, pygidium, larger, than, cephalon, trilobite, exoskeletons, show, a, variety, of, small, scale, structures, collectively, called, prosopon, prosopon, does, not, include, large, scale, extensions, of, the, cuticle, e, g, hollow, pleural, spines, but, to, finer, scale, features, such, as, ribbing, domes, pustules, pitting, ridging, and, perforations, the, exact, purpose, of, the, prosopon, is, not, resolved, but, suggestions, include, structural, strengthening, sensory, pits, or, hairs, preventing, predator, attacks, and, maintaining, aeration, while, enrolled, in, one, example, alimentary, ridge, networks, easily, visible, in, cambrian, trilobites, might, have, been, either, digestive, or, respiratory, tubes, in, the, cephalon, and, other, regions, some, trilobites, such, as, those, of, the, order, lichida, evolved, elaborate, spiny, forms, from, the, ordovician, until, the, end, of, the, devonian, period, examples, of, these, specimens, have, been, found, in, the, hamar, laghdad, formation, of, alnif, in, morocco, there, is, a, serious, counterfeiting, and, fakery, problem, with, much, of, the, moroccan, material, that, is, offered, commercially, spectacular, spined, trilobites, have, also, been, found, in, western, russia, oklahoma, usa, and, ontario, canada, some, trilobites, had, horns, on, their, heads, similar, to, several, modern, beetles, based, on, the, size, location, and, shape, of, the, horns, it, has, been, suggested, that, these, horns, may, have, been, used, to, combat, for, mates, horns, were, widespread, in, the, family, raphiophoridae, asaphida, another, function, of, these, spines, was, protection, from, predators, when, enrolled, trilobite, spines, offered, additional, protection, this, conclusion, is, likely, to, be, applicable, to, other, trilobites, as, well, such, as, in, the, phacopid, trilobite, genus, walliserops, that, developed, spectacular, tridents, only, 21, or, so, species, are, described, from, which, soft, body, parts, are, preserved, so, some, features, e, g, the, posterior, antenniform, cerci, preserved, only, in, olenoides, serratus, remain, difficult, to, assess, in, the, wider, picture, trilobites, had, a, single, pair, of, preoral, antennae, and, otherwise, undifferentiated, biramous, limbs, 2, 3, or, 4, cephalic, pairs, followed, by, one, pair, per,

also, bore, a, feather, like, exopodite, or, gill, branch, which, was, used, for, respiration, and, in, some, species, swimming, a, 2021, study, found, that, the, upper, limb, branch, of, trilobites, is, a, well, developed, gill, that, oxygenates, the, hemolymph, comparable, to, the, book, gill, in, modern, horseshoe, crab, limulus, in, olenoides, the, partially, articulated, junction, with, the,

such, they, became, secondarily, blind, in, this, branch, of, trilobite, evolution, other, trilobites, e, g, phacops, rana, and, erbenochile, erbeni, had, large, eyes, that, were, for, use, in, well, lit, predator, filled, waters, the, pair, of, antennae, suspected, in, most, trilobites, and, preserved, in, a, few, examples, were, highly, flexible, to, allow, them, to, be, retracted, when, the,

before, the, cambrian, improving, eyesight, of, both, predator, and, prey, in, marine, environments, has, been, suggested, as, one, of, the, evolutionary, pressures, furthering, an, apparent, rapid, development, of, new, life, forms, during, what, is, known, as, the, cambrian, explosion, trilobite, eyes, were, typically, compound, with, each, lens, being, an, elongated, prism, the, number, of, lenses, in, such, an, eye, varied, some, trilobites, had, only, one, while, some, had, thousands, of, lenses, in, a, single, eye, in, compound, eyes, the, lenses, were, typically, arranged, hexagonally, the, fossil, record, of, trilobite, eyes, is, complete, enough, that, their, evolution, can, be, studied, through, time, which, compensates, to, some, extent, for, the, lack, of, preservation, of, soft, internal, parts, lenses, of, trilobites, eyes, were, made, of, calcite, calcium, carbonate, caco, 3, pure, forms, of, calcite, are, transparent, and, some, trilobites, used, crystallographically, oriented, clear, calcite, crystals, to, form, each, lens, of, each, eye, rigid, calcite, lenses, would, have, been, unable, to, accommodate, to, a, change, of, focus, like, the, soft, lens, in, a, human, eye, would, in, some, trilobites, the, calcite, formed, an, internal, doublet, structure, giving, superb, depth, of, field, and, minimal, spherical, aberration, according, to, optical, principles, discovered, by, french, scientist, ren, descartes, and, dutch, physicist, christiaan, huygens, in, the, 17th, century, a, living, species, with, similar, lenses, is, the,

horseshoe, crabs, secondary, blindness, is, not, uncommon, particularly, in, long, lived, groups, such, as, the, agnostida, and, trinucleioidea, in, proetida, and, phacopina, from, western, europe, and, particularly, tropidocoryphinae, from, france, where, there, is, good, stratigraphic, control, there, are, well, studied, trends, showing, progressive, eye, reduction, between, closely, related, species, that, eventually, leads, to, blindness, several, other, structures, on, trilobites, have, been, explained, as, photo, receptors, of, particular, interest, are, macula, the, small, areas, of, thinned, cuticle, on, the, underside, of, the, hypostome, in, some, trilobites, macula, are, suggested, to, function, as, simple, ventral, eyes, that, could, have, detected, night, and, day, or, allowed, a, trilobite, to, navigate, while, swimming, or, turned, upside, down, there, are, several, types, of, prosopon, that, have, been, suggested, as, sensory, apparatus, collecting, chemical, or, vibrational, signals, the, connection, between, large, pitted, fringes, on, the, cephalon, of, harpetida, and, trinucleoidea, with, corresponding, small, or, absent, eyes, makes, for, an, interesting, possibility, of, the, fringe, as, a, compound, ear, trilobites, grew, through, successive, moult, stages, called, instars, in, which, existing, segments, increased, in, size, and, new, trunk, segments, appeared, at, a, sub, terminal, generative, zone, during, the, anamorphic, phase, of, development, this, was, followed, by, the, epimorphic, developmental, phase, in, which, the, animal, continued, to, grow, and, moult, but, no, new, trunk, segments, were, expressed, in, the, exoskeleton, the, combination, of, anamorphic, and, epimorphic, growth, constitutes, the, hemianamorphic, developmental, mode, that, is, common, among, many, living, arthropods, trilobite, development, was, unusual, in, the, way, in, which, articulations, developed, between, segments, and, changes, in, the, development, of, articulation, gave, rise, to, the, conventionally, recognized, developmental, phases, of, the, trilobite, life, cycle, divided, into, 3, stages, which, are, not, readily, comparable, with, those, of, other, arthropods, actual, growth, and, change, in, external, form, of, the, trilobite, would, have, occurred, when, the, trilobite, was, soft, shelled, following, moulting, and, before, the, next, exoskeleton, hardened, trilobite, larvae, are, known, from, the, cambrian, to, the, carboniferous, and, from, all, sub, orders, as, instars, from, closely, related, taxa, are, more, similar, than, instars, from, distantly, related, taxa, trilobite, larvae, provide, morphological, information, important, in, evaluating, high, level, phylogenetic, relationships, among, trilobites, despite, the, absence, of, supporting, fossil, evidence, their, similarity, to, living, arthropods, has, led, to, the, belief, that, trilobites, multiplied, sexually, and, produced, eggs, some, species, may, have, kept, eggs, or, larvae, in, a, brood, pouch, forward, of, the, glabella, particularly, when, the, ecological, niche, was, challenging, to, larvae, size, and, morphology, of, the, first, calcified, stage, are, highly, variable, between, but, not, within, trilobite, taxa, suggesting, some, trilobites, passed, through, more, growth, within, the, egg, than, others, early, developmental, stages, prior, to, calcification, of, the, exoskeleton, are, a, possibility, suggested, for, fallotaspids, but, so, is, calcification, and, hatching, coinciding, the, earliest, post, embryonic, trilobite, growth, stage, known, with, certainty, are, the, protaspid, stages, anamorphic, phase, starting, with, an, indistinguishable, proto, cephalon, and, proto, pygidium, anaprotaspid, a, number, of, changes, occur, ending, with, a, transverse, furrow, separating, the, proto, cephalon, and, proto, pygidium, metaprotaspid, that, can, continue, to, add, segments, segments, are, added, at, the, posterior, part, of, the, pygidium, but, all, segments, remain, fused, together, the, meraspid, stages, anamorphic, phase, are, marked, by, the, appearance, of, an, articulation, between, the, head, and, the, fused, trunk, prior, to, the, onset, of, the, first, meraspid, stage, the, animal, had, a, two, part, structure, the, head, and, the, plate, of, fused, trunk, segments, the, pygidium, during, the, meraspid, stages, new, segments, appeared, near, the, rear, of, the, pygidium, as, well, as, additional, articulations, developing, at, the, front, of, the, pygidium, releasing, freely, articulating, segments, into, the, thorax, segments, are, generally, added, one, per, moult, although, two, per, moult, and, one, every, alternate, moult, are, also, recorded, with, number, of, stages, equal, to, the, number, of, thoracic, segments, a, substantial, amount, of, growth, from, less, than, 25, up, to, 30, 40, probably, took, place, in, the, meraspid, stages, the, holaspid, stages, epimorphic, phase, commence, when, a, stable, mature, number, of, segments, has, been, released, into, the, thorax, moulting, continued, during, the, holaspid, stages, with, no, changes, in, thoracic, segment, number, some, trilobites, are, suggested, to, have, continued, moulting, and, growing, throughout, the, life, of, the, individual, albeit, at, a, slower, rate, on, reaching, maturity, some, trilobites, showed, a, marked, transition, in, morphology, at, one, particular, instar, which, has, been, called, trilobite, metamorphosis, radical, change, in, morphology, is, linked, to, the, loss, or, gain, of, distinctive, features, that, mark, a, change, in, mode, of, life, a, change, in, lifestyle, during, development, has, significance, in, terms, of, evolutionary, pressure, as, the, trilobite, could, pass, through, several, ecological, niches, on, the, way, to, adult, development, and, changes, would, strongly, affect, survivorship, and, dispersal, of, trilobite, taxa, it, is, worth, noting, that, trilobites, with, all, protaspid, stages, solely, planktonic, and, later, meraspid, stages, benthic, e, g, asaphids, failed, to, last, through, the, ordovician, extinctions, while, trilobites, that, were, planktonic, for, only, the, first, protaspid, stage, before, metamorphosing, into, benthic, forms, survived, e, g, lichids, phacopids, pelagic, larval, life, style, proved, ill, adapted, to, the, rapid, onset, of, global, climatic, cooling, and, loss, of, tropical, shelf, habitats, during, the, ordovician, there, is, no, evidence, that, trilobites, reabsorbed, their, exoskeletons, during, moulting, some, authors, have, argued, that, the, failure, of, trilobites, to, reabsorb, their, mineralised, exoskeletons, when, they, moulted, was, a, functional, disadvantage, when, compared, to, modern, arthropods, that, generally, do, reabsorb, their, cuticles, as, it, took, substantially, longer, to, reconstruct, their, exoskeletons, making, them, more, vulnerable, to, predators, rev, edward, lhwyd, published, in, 1698, in, the, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, the, oldest, scientific, journal,
