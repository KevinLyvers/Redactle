horned, from, rhis, nose, and, k, ras, horn, pl, rhinoceros, or, rhinoceroses, commonly, abbreviated, to, rhino, is, a, member, of, any, of, the, five, extant, species, or, numerous, extinct, species, of, odd, toed, ungulates, in, the, family, rhinocerotidae, it, can, also, refer, to, a, member, of, any, of, the, extinct, species, of, the, superfamily, rhinocerotoidea, two, of, the, extant, species, are, native, to, africa, and, three, to, south, and, southeast, asia, rhinoceroses, are, some, of, the, largest, remaining, megafauna, all, weigh, at, least, one, tonne, in, adulthood, they, have, a, herbivorous, diet, small, brains, 400, 600, g, 14, 21, oz, for, mammals, of, their, size, one, or, two, horns, and, a, thick, 1, 5, 5, cm, 0, 59, 1, 97, in, protective, skin, formed, from, layers, of, collagen, positioned, in, a, lattice, structure, they, generally, eat, leafy, material, although, their, ability, to, ferment, food, in, their, hindgut, allows, them, to, subsist, on, more, fibrous, plant, matter, when, necessary, unlike, other, perissodactyls, the, two, african, species, of, rhinoceros, lack, teeth, at, the, front, of, their, mouths, they, rely, instead, on, their, lips, to, pluck, food, rhinoceroses, are, killed, by, poachers, for, their, horns, which, are, bought, and, sold, on, the, black, market, for, high, prices, leading, to, most, living, rhinoceros, species, being, considered, endangered, the, contemporary, market, for, rhino, horn, is, overwhelmingly, driven, by, china, and, vietnam, where, it, is, bought, by, wealthy, consumers, to, use, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, among, other, uses, rhino, horns, are, made, of, keratin, the, same, material, as, hair, and, fingernails, and, there, is, no, good, evidence, of, any, health, benefits, a, market, also, exists, for, rhino, horn, dagger, handles, in, yemen, which, was, the, major, source, of, demand, for, rhino, horn, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, ceratotherium, simum, diceros, bicornis, dicerorhinus, sumatrensis, rhinoceros, sondaicus, rhinoceros, unicornis, the, word, rhinoceros, is, derived, through, latin, from, the, ancient, greek, which, is, composed, of, rhino, of, the, nose, and, keras, horn, with, a, horn, on, the, nose, the, name, has, been, in, use, since, the, 14th, century, the, family, rhinocerotidae, consists, of, only, four, extant, genera, ceratotherium, white, rhinoceros, diceros, black, rhinoceros, dicerorhinus, sumatran, rhinoceros, and, rhinoceros, indian, and, javan, rhinoceros, the, living, species, fall, into, three, categories, the, two, african, species, the, white, rhinoceros, and, the, black, rhinoceros, belong, to, the, tribe, dicerotini, which, originated, in, the, middle, miocene, about, 14, 2, million, years, ago, the, species, diverged, during, the, early, pliocene, about, 5, million, years, ago, the, main, difference, between, black, and, white, rhinos, is, the, shape, of, their, mouths, white, rhinos, have, broad, flat, lips, for, grazing, whereas, black, rhinos, have, long, pointed, lips, for, eating, foliage, there, are, two, living, rhinocerotini, species, the, indian, rhinoceros, and, the, javan, rhinoceros, which, diverged, from, one, another, about, 10, million, years, ago, the, sumatran, rhinoceros, is, the, only, surviving, representative, of, the, dicerorhinini, a, subspecific, hybrid, white, rhino, ceratotherium, s, simum, c, s, cottoni, was, bred, at, the, dv, r, kr, lov, zoo, zoological, garden, dvur, kralove, nad, labem, in, the, czech, republic, in, 1977, interspecific, hybridisation, of, black, and, white, rhinoceroses, has, also, been, confirmed, while, the, black, rhinoceros, has, 84, chromosomes, diploid, number, 2n, per, cell, all, other, rhinoceros, species, have, 82, chromosomes, chromosomal, polymorphism, might, lead, to, varying, chromosome, counts, for, instance, in, a, study, there, were, three, northern, white, rhinoceroses, with, 81, chromosomes, there, are, two, subspecies, of, white, rhinoceros, the, southern, white, rhinoceros, ceratotherium, simum, simum, and, the, northern, white, rhinoceros, ceratotherium, simum, cottoni, as, of, 2013, the, southern, subspecies, has, a, wild, population, of, 20, 405, making, them, the, most, abundant, rhino, subspecies, in, the, world, the, northern, subspecies, is, critically, endangered, with, all, that, is, known, to, remain, being, two, captive, females, there, is, no, conclusive, explanation, of, the, name, white, rhinoceros, a, popular, idea, that, white, is, a, distortion, of, either, the, afrikaans, word, wyd, or, the, dutch, word, wijd, or, its, other, possible, spellings, whyde, weit, etc, meaning, wide, and, referring, to, the, rhino, s, square, lips, is, not, supported, by, linguistic, studies, the, white, rhino, has, an, immense, body, and, large, head, a, short, neck, and, broad, chest, females, weigh, 1, 600, kg, 3, 500, lb, and, males, 2, 400, kg, 5, 300, lb, the, head, and, body, length, is, 3, 5, 4, 6, m, 11, 15, ft, and, the, shoulder, height, is, 1, 8, 2, m, 5, 9, 6, 6, ft, on, its, snout, it, has, two, horns, the, front, horn, is, larger, than, the, other, horn, and, averages, 90, cm, 35, in, in, length, and, can, reach, 150, cm, 59, in, the, white, rhinoceros, also, has, a, prominent, muscular, hump, that, supports, its, relatively, large, head, the, colour, of, this, animal, can, range, from, yellowish, brown, to, slate, grey, most, of, its, body, hair, is, found, on, the, ear, fringes, and, tail, bristles, with, the, rest, distributed, rather, sparsely, over, the, rest, of, the, body, white, rhinos, have, the, distinctive, flat, broad, mouth, that, is, used, for, grazing, the, name, black, rhinoceros, diceros, bicornis, was, chosen, to, distinguish, this, species, from, the, white, rhinoceros, ceratotherium, simum, this, can, be, confusing, as, the, two, species, are, not, truly, distinguishable, by, color, there, are, four, subspecies, of, black, rhino, south, central, diceros, bicornis, minor, the, most, numerous, which, once, ranged, from, central, tanzania, south, through, zambia, zimbabwe, and, mozambique, to, northern, and, eastern, south, africa, south, western, diceros, bicornis, occidentalis, which, are, better, adapted, to, the, arid, and, semi, arid, savannas, of, namibia, southern, angola, western, botswana, and, western, south, africa, east, african, diceros, bicornis, michaeli, primarily, in, tanzania, and, west, african, diceros, bicornis, longipes, which, was, declared, extinct, in,

which, by, 2011, had, dwindled, to, 216, it, has, been, found, through, dna, comparison, that, the, sumatran, rhinoceros, is, the, most, ancient, extant, rhinoceros, and, related, to, the, extinct, eurasian, woolly, rhino, species, coelodonta, in, 1994, alan, rabinowitz, publicly, denounced, governments, non, governmental, organizations, and, other, institutions, for, lacking, in, their, attempts, to, conserve, the, sumatran, rhinoceros, to, conserve, it, they, would, have, to, relocate, them, from, small, forests, to, breeding, programs, that, could, monitor, their, breeding, success, to, boost, reproduction, the, malaysian, and, indonesian, governments, could, also, agree, to, exchange, the, gametes, of, the, sumatran, and, smaller, bornean, subspecies, the, indonesian, and, malaysian, governments, have, also, proposed, a, single, management, unit, for, these, two, ancient, subspecies, plantations, for, palm, oil, have, taken, out, the, living, areas, and, led, to,

the, late, eocene, namely, the, hyracodontidae, amynodontidae, paraceratheriidae, and, rhinocerotidae, hyracodontidae, also, known, as, running, rhinos, showed, adaptations, for, speed, and, would, have, looked, more, like, horses, than, modern, rhinos, the, smallest, hyracodontids, were, dog, sized, hyracodontids, spread, across, eurasia, from, the, mid, eocene, to, early, oligocene, the, amynodontidae, also, known, as, aquatic, rhinos, dispersed, across, north, america, and, eurasia, from, the, late, eocene, to, early, oligocene, the, amynodontids, were, hippopotamus, like, in, their, ecology, and, appearance, inhabiting, rivers, and, lakes, and, sharing, many, of, the, same, adaptations, to, aquatic, life, as, hippos, the, paraceratheriidae, also, known, as, paraceratheres, or, indricotheres, originated, in, the, eocene, epoch, and, lived, until, the, early, miocene, the, first, paraceratheres, were, only, about, the, size, of, large, dogs, growing, progressively, larger, in, the, late, eocene, and, oligocene, the, largest, genus, of, the, family, was, paraceratherium, which, was, more, than, twice, as, heavy, as, a, bull, african, elephant, and, was, one, of, the, largest, land, mammals, that, ever, lived, the, family, of, all, modern, rhinoceroses, the, rhinocerotidae, first, appeared, in, the, late, eocene, in, eurasia, the, earliest, members, of, rhinocerotidae, were, small, and, numerous, at, least, 26, genera, lived, in, eurasia, and, north, america, until, a, wave, of, extinctions, in, the, middle, oligocene, wiped, out, most, of, the,

method, consisting, of, infusing, the, horns, of, living, rhinos, with, a, mixture, of, a, pink, dye, and, an, acaricide, to, kill, ticks, which, is, safe, for, rhinos, but, toxic, to, humans, the, procedure, also, includes, inserting, three, rfid, identification, chips, and, taking, dna, samples, because, of, the, fibrous, nature, of, rhino, horn, the, pressurized, dye, infuses, the, interior, of, the, horn, but, does, not, color, the, surface, or, affect, rhino, behavior, depending, on, the, quantity, of, horn, a, person, consumes, experts, believe, the, acaricide, would, cause, nausea, stomach, ache, and, diarrhea, and, possibly, convulsions, it, would, not, be, fatal, the, primary, deterrent, is, the, knowledge, that, the, treatment, has, been, applied, communicated, by, signs, posted, at, the, refuges, the, original, idea, grew, out, of, research, into, the, horn, as, a, reservoir, for, one, time, tick, treatments, and, experts, selected, an, acaricide, they, think, is, safe, for, the, rhino, oxpeckers, vultures, and, other, animals, in, the, preserve, s, ecosystem, proponents, claim, that, the, dye, cannot, be, removed, from, the, horns, and, remains, visible, on, x, ray, scanners, even, when, the, horn, is, ground, to, a, fine, powder, the, uk, charity, organization, save, the, rhino, has, criticized, horn, poisoning, on, moral, and, practical, grounds, the, organization, questions, the, assumptions, that, the, infusion, technique, works, as, intended, and, that, even, if, the, poison, were, effective, whether, middlemen, in, a, lucrative, illegal, trade, would, care, much, about, the, effect, it, would, have, on, buyers, additionally, rhino, horn, is, increasingly, purchased, for, decorative, use, rather, than, for, use, in, traditional, medicine, save, the, rhino, questions, the, feasibility, of, applying, the, technique, to, all, african, rhinos, since, workers, would, have, to, reapply, the, acaricide, every, four, years, it, was, also, reported, that, one, out, of, 150, rhinos, treated, did, not, survive, the, anesthesia, another, way, to, undercut, the, rhinoceros, horn, market, has, been, suggested, by, matthew, markus, of, pembient, a, biotechnology, firm, he, proposes, the, synthesis, of, an, artificial, substitute, for, rhinoceros, horn, to, enable, authorities, to, distinguish, the, bioengineered, horn, from, real, rhinoceros, horn, the, genetic, code, of, the, bioengineered, horn, could, be, registered, similar, to, the, dna, of, living, rhinoceros, in, the, rhodis, rhino, dna, index, system, initial, responses, from, many, conservationists, were, negative, but, a, 2016, report, from, traffic, which, monitors, trade, in, wildlife, and, animal, parts, conceded, that, it, would, be, rash, to, rule, out, the, possibility, that, trade, in, synthetic, rhinoceros, horn, could, play, a, role, in, future, conservation, strategies, greek, historian, and, geographer, agatharchides, 2nd, century, bc, mentions, the, rhinoceros, in, his, book, on, the, erythraean, sea, in, khmer, art, the, hindu, god, agni, is, depicted, with, a, rhinoceros, as, his, vahana, similarly, in, medieval, era, thai,

description, and, brief, sketch, by, valentim, fernandes, a, german, printer, resident, in, lisbon, he, never, saw, the, animal, itself, so, d, rer, s, rhinoceros, is, a, somewhat, inaccurate,
