exercise, is, physical, activity, that, enhances, or, maintains, fitness, and, overall, health, it, is, performed, for, various, reasons, including, weight, loss, or, maintenance, to, aid, growth, and, improve, strength, develop, muscles, and, the, cardiovascular, system, hone, athletic, skills, improve, health, or, simply, for, enjoyment, many, individuals, choose, to, exercise, outdoors, where, they, can, congregate, in, groups, socialize, and, improve, well, being, as, well, as, mental, health, in, terms, of, health, benefits, usually, 2, 5, hours, of, moderate, intensity, exercise, per, week, is, recommended, for, reducing, the, risk, of, health, problems, at, the, same, time, even, doing, a, small, amount, of, exercise, is, healthier, than, doing, none, only, doing, an, hour, and, a, quarter, 11, minutes, day, of, exercise, could, reduce, the, risk, of, early, death, cardiovascular, disease, stroke, and, cancer, physical, exercises, are, generally, grouped, into, three, types, depending, on, the, overall, effect, they, have, on, the, human, body, physical, exercise, can, also, include, training, that, focuses, on, accuracy, agility, power, and, speed, types, of, exercise, can, also, be, classified, as, dynamic, or, static, dynamic, exercises, such, as, steady, running, tend, to, produce, a, lowering, of, the, diastolic, blood, pressure, during, exercise, due, to, the, improved, blood, flow, conversely, static, exercise, such, as, weight, lifting, can, cause, the, systolic, pressure, to, rise, significantly, albeit, transiently, during, the, performance, of, the, exercise, physical, exercise, is, important, for, maintaining, physical, fitness, and, can, contribute, to, maintaining, a, healthy, weight, regulating, the, digestive, system, building, and, maintaining, healthy, bone, density, muscle, strength, and, joint, mobility, promoting, physiological, well, being, reducing, surgical, risks, and, strengthening, the, immune, system, some, studies, indicate, that, exercise, may, increase, life, expectancy, and, the, overall, quality, of, life, people, who, participate, in, moderate, to, high, levels, of, physical, exercise, have, a, lower, mortality, rate, compared, to, individuals, who, by, comparison, are, not, physically, active, moderate, levels, of, exercise, have, been, correlated, with, preventing, aging, by, reducing, inflammatory, potential, the, majority, of, the, benefits, from, exercise, are, achieved, with, around, 3500, metabolic, equivalent, met, minutes, per, week, with, diminishing, returns, at, higher, levels, of, activity, for, example, climbing, stairs, 10, minutes, vacuuming, 15, minutes, gardening, 20, minutes, running, 20, minutes, and, walking, or, bicycling, for, transportation, 25, minutes, on, a, daily, basis, would, together, achieve, about, 3000, met, minutes, a, week, a, lack, of, physical, activity, causes, approximately, 6, of, the, burden, of, disease, from, coronary, heart, disease, 7, of, type, 2, diabetes, 10, of, breast, cancer, and, 10, of, colon, cancer, worldwide, overall, physical, inactivity, causes, 9, of, premature, mortality, worldwide, the, american, british, writer, bill, bryson, wrote, if, someone, invented, a, pill, that, could, do, for, us, all, that, a, moderate, amount, of, exercise, achieves, it, would, instantly, become, the, most, successful, drug, in, history, most, people, can, increase, fitness, by, increasing, physical, activity, levels, increases, in, muscle, size, from, resistance, training, are, primarily, determined, by, diet, and, testosterone, this, genetic, variation, in, improvement, from, training, is, one, of, the, key, physiological, differences, between, elite, athletes, and, the, larger, population, there, is, evidence, that, exercising, in, middle, age, may, lead, to, better, physical, ability, later, in, life, early, motor, skills, and, development, is, also, related, to, physical, activity, and, performance, later, in, life, children, who, are, more, proficient, with, motor, skills, early, on, are, more, inclined, to, be, physically, active, and, thus, tend, to, perform, well, in, sports, and, have, better, fitness, levels, early, motor, proficiency, has, a, positive, correlation, to, childhood, physical, activity, and, fitness, levels, while, less, proficiency, in, motor, skills, results, in, a, more, sedentary, lifestyle, the, type, and, intensity, of, physical, activity, performed, may, have, an, effect, on, a, person, s, fitness, level, there, is, some, weak, evidence, that, high, intensity, interval, training, may, improve, a, person, s, vo2, max, slightly, more, than, lower, intensity, endurance, training, however, unscientific, fitness, methods, could, lead, to, sports, injuries, the, beneficial, effect, of, exercise, on, the, cardiovascular, system, is, well, documented, there, is, a, direct, correlation, between, physical, inactivity, and, cardiovascular, disease, and, physical, inactivity, is, an, independent, risk, factor, for, the, development, of, coronary, artery, disease, low, levels, of, physical, exercise, increase, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, diseases, mortality, children, who, participate, in, physical, exercise, experience, greater, loss, of, body, fat, and, increased, cardiovascular, fitness, studies, have, shown, that, academic, stress, in, youth, increases, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, in, later, years, however, these, risks, can, be, greatly, decreased, with, regular, physical, exercise, there, is, a, dose, response, relationship, between, the, amount, of, exercise, performed, from, approximately, 700, 2000, kcal, of, energy, expenditure, per, week, and, all, cause, mortality, and, cardiovascular, disease, mortality, in, middle, aged, and, elderly, men, the, greatest, potential, for, reduced, mortality, is, seen, in, sedentary, individuals, who, become, moderately, active, studies, have, shown, that, since, heart, disease, is, the, leading, cause, of, death, in, women, regular, exercise, in, aging, women, leads, to, healthier, cardiovascular, profiles, most, beneficial, effects, of, physical, activity, on, cardiovascular, disease, mortality, can, be, attained, through, moderate, intensity, activity, 40, 60, of, maximal, oxygen, uptake, depending, on, age, persons, who, modify, their, behavior, after, myocardial, infarction, to, include, regular, exercise, have, improved, rates, of, survival, persons, who, remain, sedentary, have, the, highest, risk, for, all, cause, and, cardiovascular, disease, mortality, according, to, the, american, heart, association, exercise, reduces, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, diseases, including, heart, attack, and, stroke, some, have, suggested, that, increases, in, physical, exercise, might, decrease, healthcare, costs, increase, the, rate, of, job, attendance, as, well, as, increase, the, amount, of, effort, women, put, into, their, jobs, although, there, have, been, hundreds, of, studies, on, physical, exercise, and, the, immune, system, there, is, little, direct, evidence, on, its, connection, to, illness, epidemiological, evidence, suggests, that, moderate, exercise, has, a, beneficial, effect, on, the, human, immune, system, an, effect, which, is, modeled, in, a, j, curve, moderate, exercise, has, been, associated, with, a, 29, decreased, incidence, of, upper, respiratory, tract, infections, urti, but, studies, of, marathon, runners, found, that, their, prolonged, high, intensity, exercise, was, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, infection, occurrence, however, another, study, did, not, find, the, effect, immune, cell, functions, are, impaired, following, acute, sessions, of, prolonged, high, intensity, exercise, and, some, studies, have, found, that, athletes, are, at, a, higher, risk, for, infections, studies, have, shown, that, strenuous, stress, for, long, durations, such, as, training, for, a, marathon, can, suppress, the, immune, system, by, decreasing, the, concentration, of, lymphocytes, the, immune, systems, of, athletes, and, nonathletes, are, generally, similar, athletes, may, have, a, slightly, elevated, natural, killer, cell, count, and, cytolytic, action, but, these, are, unlikely, to, be, clinically, significant, vitamin, c, supplementation, has, been, associated, with, a, lower, incidence, of, upper, respiratory, tract, infections, in, marathon, runners, biomarkers, of, inflammation, such, as, c, reactive, protein, which, are, associated, with, chronic, diseases, are, reduced, in, active, individuals, relative, to, sedentary, individuals, and, the, positive, effects, of, exercise, may, be, due, to, its, anti, inflammatory, effects, in, individuals, with, heart, disease, exercise, interventions, lower, blood, levels, of, fibrinogen, and, c, reactive, protein, an, important, cardiovascular, risk, marker, the, depression, in, the, immune, system, following, acute, bouts, of, exercise, may, be, one, of, the, mechanisms, for, this, anti, inflammatory, effect, a, systematic, review, evaluated, 45, studies, that, examined, the, relationship, between, physical, activity, and, cancer, survival, rates, according, to, the, review, was, consistent, evidence, from, 27, observational, studies, that, physical, activity, is, associated, with, reduced, all, cause, breast, cancer, specific, and, colon, cancer, specific, mortality, there, is, currently, insufficient, evidence, regarding, the, association, between, physical, activity, and, mortality, for, survivors, of, other, cancers, evidence, suggests, that, exercise, may, positively, affect, the, quality, of, life, in, cancer, survivors, including, factors, such, as, anxiety, self, esteem, and, emotional, well, being, for, people, with, cancer, undergoing, active, treatment, exercise, may, also, have, positive, effects, on, health, related, quality, of, life, such, as, fatigue, and, physical, functioning, this, is, likely, to, be, more, pronounced, with, higher, intensity, exercise, exercise, may, contribute, to, a, reduction, of, cancer, related, fatigue, in, survivors, of, breast, cancer, although, there, is, only, limited, scientific, evidence, on, the, subject, people, with, cancer, cachexia, are, encouraged, to, engage, in, physical, exercise, due, to, various, factors, some, individuals, with, cancer, cachexia, have, a, limited, capacity, for, physical, exercise, compliance, with, prescribed, exercise, is, low, in, individuals, with, cachexia, and, clinical, trials, of, exercise, in, this, population, often, have, high, drop, out, rates, there, is, low, quality, evidence, for, an, effect, of, aerobic, physical, exercises, on, anxiety, and, serious, adverse, events, in, adults, with, hematological, malignancies, aerobic, physical, exercise, may, result, in, little, to, no, difference, in, the, mortality, quality, of, life, or, physical, functioning, these, exercises, may, result, in, a, slight, reduction, in, depression, and, reduction, in, fatigue, the, neurobiological, effects, of, physical, exercise, involve, possible, interrelated, effects, on, brain, structure, brain, function, and, cognition, research, in, humans, has, demonstrated, that, consistent, aerobic, exercise, e, g, 30, minutes, every, day, may, induce, improvements, in, certain, cognitive, functions, neuroplasticity, and, behavioral, plasticity, some, of, these, long, term, effects, may, include, increased, neuron, growth, increased, neurological, activity, e, g, c, fos, and, bdnf, signaling, improved, stress, coping, enhanced, cognitive, control, of, behavior, improved, declarative, spatial, and, working, memory, and, structural, and, functional, improvements, in, brain, structures, and, pathways, associated, with, cognitive, control, and, memory, the, effects, of, exercise, on, cognition, may, affect, academic, performance, in, children, and, college, students, improve, adult, productivity, preserve, cognitive, function, in, old, age, preventing, or, treating, certain, neurological, disorders, and, improving, overall, quality, of, life, in, healthy, adults, aerobic, exercise, has, been, shown, to, induce, transient, effects, on, cognition, after, a, single, exercise, session, and, persistent, effects, on, cognition, following, consistent, exercise, over, the, course, of, several, months, people, who, regularly, perform, an, aerobic, exercise, e, g, running, jogging, brisk, walking, swimming, and, cycling, have, greater, scores, on, neuropsychological, function, and, performance, tests, that, measure, certain, cognitive, functions, such, as, attentional, control, inhibitory, control, cognitive, flexibility, working, memory, updating, and, capacity, declarative, memory, spatial, memory, and, information, processing, speed, aerobic, exercise, has, both, short, and, long, term, effects, on, mood, and, emotional, states, by, promoting, positive, affect, inhibiting, negative, affect, and, decreasing, the, biological, response, to, acute, psychological, stress, aerobic, exercise, may, affect, both, self, esteem, and, overall, well, being, including, sleep, patterns, with, consistent, long, term, participation, regular, aerobic, exercise, may, improve, symptoms, associated, with, central, nervous, system, disorders, and, may, be, used, as, adjunct, therapy, for, these, disorders, there, is, some, evidence, of, exercise, treatment, efficacy, for, major, depressive, disorder, and, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, the, american, academy, of, neurology, s, clinical, practice, guideline, for, mild, cognitive, impairment, indicates, that, clinicians, should, recommend, regular, exercise, two, times, per, week, to, individuals, who, have, been, diagnosed, with, this, condition, some, preclinical, evidence, and, emerging, clinical, evidence, supports, the, use, of, exercise, as, an, adjunct, therapy, for, the, treatment, and, prevention, of, drug, addictions, a, number, of, medical, reviews, have, indicated, that, exercise, has, a, marked, and, persistent, antidepressant, effect, in, humans, an, effect, believed, to, be, mediated, through, enhanced, bdnf, signaling, in, the, brain, several, systematic, reviews, have, analyzed, the, potential, for, physical, exercise, in, the, treatment, of, depressive, disorders, the, 2013, cochrane, collaboration, review, on, physical, exercise, for, depression, noted, that, based, upon, limited, evidence, it, is, more, effective, than, a, control, intervention, and, comparable, to, psychological, or, antidepressant, drug, therapies, three, subsequent, 2014, systematic, reviews, that, included, the, cochrane, review, in, their, analysis, concluded, with, similar, findings, one, indicated, that, physical, exercise, is, effective, as, an, adjunct, treatment, i, e, treatments, that, are, used, together, with, antidepressant, medication, the, other, two, indicated, that, physical, exercise, has, marked, antidepressant, effects, and, recommended, the, inclusion, of, physical, activity, as, an, adjunct, treatment, for, mild, moderate, depression, and, mental, illness, in, general, one, systematic, review, noted, that, yoga, may, be, effective, in, alleviating, symptoms, of, prenatal, depression, another, review, asserted, that, evidence, from, clinical, trials, supports, the, efficacy, of, physical, exercise, as, a, treatment, for, depression, over, a, 2, 4, month, period, these, benefits, have, also, been, noted, in, old, age, with, a, review, conducted, in, 2019, finding, that, exercise, is, an, effective, treatment, for, clinically, diagnosed, depression, in, older, adults, continuous, aerobic, exercise, can, induce, a, transient, state, of, euphoria, colloquially, known, as, a, runner, s, high, in, distance, running, or, a, rower, s, high, in, crew, through, the, increased, biosynthesis, of, at, least, three, euphoriant, neurochemicals, anandamide, an, endocannabinoid, endorphin, an, endogenous, opioid, and, phenethylamine, a, trace, amine, and, amphetamine, analog, preliminary, evidence, from, a, 2012, review, indicated, that, physical, training, for, up, to, four, months, may, increase, sleep, quality, in, adults, over, 40, years, of, age, a, 2010, review, suggested, that, exercise, generally, improved, sleep, for, most, people, and, may, help, with, insomnia, but, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, draw, detailed, conclusions, about, the, relationship, between, exercise, and, sleep, a, 2018, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, suggested, that, exercise, can, improve, sleep, quality, in, people, with, insomnia, one, 2013, study, found, that, exercising, improved, sexual, arousal, problems, related, to, antidepressant, use, people, who, participate, in, physical, exercise, experience, increased, cardiovascular, fitness, there, is, some, level, of, concern, about, additional, exposure, to, air, pollution, when, exercising, outdoors, especially, near, traffic, resistance, training, and, subsequent, consumption, of, a, protein, rich, meal, promotes, muscle, hypertrophy, and, gains, in, muscle, strength, by, stimulating, myofibrillar, muscle, protein, synthesis, mps, and, inhibiting, muscle, protein, breakdown, mpb, the, stimulation, of, muscle, protein, synthesis, by, resistance, training, occurs, via, phosphorylation, of, the, mechanistic, target, of, rapamycin, mtor, and, subsequent, activation, of, mtorc1, which, leads, to, protein, biosynthesis, in, cellular, ribosomes, via, phosphorylation, of, mtorc1, s, immediate, targets, the, p70s6, kinase, and, the, translation, repressor, protein, 4ebp1, the, suppression, of, muscle, protein, breakdown, following, food, consumption, occurs, primarily, via, increases, in, plasma, insulin, similarly, increased, muscle, protein, synthesis, via, activation, of, mtorc1, and, suppressed, muscle, protein, breakdown, via, insulin, independent, mechanisms, has, also, been, shown, to, occur, following, ingestion, of, hydroxy, methylbutyric, acid, aerobic, exercise, induces, mitochondrial, biogenesis, and, an, increased, capacity, for, oxidative, phosphorylation, in, the, mitochondria, of, skeletal, muscle, which, is, one, mechanism, by, which, aerobic, exercise, enhances, submaximal, endurance, performance, these, effects, occur, via, an, exercise, induced, increase, in, the, intracellular, amp, atp, ratio, thereby, triggering, the, activation, of, amp, activated, protein, kinase, ampk, which, subsequently, phosphorylates, peroxisome, proliferator, activated, receptor, gamma, coactivator, 1, pgc, 1, the, master, regulator, of, mitochondrial, biogenesis, developing, research, has, demonstrated, that, many, of, the, benefits, of, exercise, are, mediated, through, the, role, of, skeletal, muscle, as, an, endocrine, organ, that, is, contracting, muscles, release, multiple, substances, known, as, myokines, which, promote, the, growth, of, new, tissue, tissue, repair, and, multiple, anti, inflammatory, functions, which, in, turn, reduce, the, risk, of, developing, various, inflammatory, diseases, exercise, reduces, levels, of, cortisol, which, causes, many, health, problems, both, physical, and, mental, endurance, exercise, before, meals, lowers, blood, glucose, more, than, the, same, exercise, after, meals, there, is, evidence, that, vigorous, exercise, 90, 95, of, vo, 2, max, induces, a, greater, degree, of, physiological, cardiac, hypertrophy, than, moderate, exercise, 40, to, 70, of, vo, 2, max, but, it, is, unknown, whether, this, has, any, effects, on, overall, morbidity, and, or, mortality, both, aerobic, and, anaerobic, exercise, work, to, increase, the, mechanical, efficiency, of, the, heart, by, increasing, cardiac, volume, aerobic, exercise, or, myocardial, thickness, strength, training, ventricular, hypertrophy, the, thickening, of, the, ventricular, walls, is, generally, beneficial, and, healthy, if, it, occurs, in, response, to, exercise, the, effects, of, physical, exercise, on, the, central, nervous, system, may, be, mediated, in, part, by, specific, neurotrophic, factor, hormones, released, into, the, blood, by, muscles, including, bdnf, igf, 1, and, vegf, community, wide, and, school, campaigns, are, often, used, in, an, attempt, to, increase, a, population, s, level, of, physical, activity, studies, to, determine, the, effectiveness, of, these, types, of, programs, need, to, be, interpreted, cautiously, as, the, results, vary, there, is, some, evidence, that, certain, types, of, exercise, programmes, for, older, adults, such, as, those, involving, gait, balance, co, ordination, and, functional, tasks, can, improve, balance, following, progressive, resistance, training, older, adults, also, respond, with, improved, physical, function, brief, interventions, promoting, physical, activity, may, be, cost, effective, however, this, evidence, is, weak, and, there, are, variations, between, studies, environmental, approaches, appear, promising, signs, that, encourage, the, use, of, stairs, as, well, as, community, campaigns, may, increase, exercise, levels, the, city, of, bogot, colombia, for, example, blocks, off, 113, kilometers, 70, mi, of, roads, on, sundays, and, holidays, to, make, it, easier, for, its, citizens, to, get, exercise, such, pedestrian, zones, are, part, of, an, effort, to, combat, chronic, diseases, and, to, maintain, a, healthy, bmi, parents, can, promote, physical, activity, by, modelling, healthy, levels, of, physical, activity, or, by, encouraging, physical, activity, according, to, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, in, the, united, states, children, and, adolescents, should, do, 60, minutes, or, more, of, physical, activity, each, day, implementing, physical, exercise, in, the, school, system, and, ensuring, an, environment, in, which, children, can, reduce, barriers, to, maintain, a, healthy, lifestyle, is, essential, the, european, commission, s, directorate, general, for, education, and, culture, dg, eac, has, dedicated, programs, and, funds, for, health, enhancing, physical, activity, hepa, projects, within, its, horizon, 2020, and, erasmus, program, as, research, showed, that, too, many, europeans, are, not, physically, active, enough, financing, is, available, for, increased, collaboration, between, players, active, in, this, field, across, the, eu, and, around, the, world, the, promotion, of, hepa, in, the, eu, and, its, partner, countries, and, the, european, sports, week, the, dg, eac, regularly, publishes, a, eurobarometer, on, sport, and, physical, activity, worldwide, there, has, been, a, large, shift, toward, less, physically, demanding, work, this, has, been, accompanied, by, increasing, use, of, mechanized, transportation, a, greater, prevalence, of, labor, saving, technology, in, the, home, and, fewer, active, recreational, pursuits, personal, lifestyle, changes, however, can, correct, the, lack, of, physical, exercise, research, published, in, 2015, suggests, that, incorporating, mindfulness, into, physical, exercise, interventions, increases, exercise, adherence, and, self, efficacy, and, also, has, positive, effects, both, psychologically, and, physiologically, exercising, looks, different, in, every, country, as, do, the, motivations, behind, exercising, in, some, countries, people, exercise, primarily, indoors, such, as, at, home, or, health, clubs, while, in, others, people, primarily, exercise, outdoors, people, may, exercise, for, personal, enjoyment, health, and, well, being, social, interactions, competition, or, training, etc, these, differences, could, potentially, be, attributed, to, a, variety, of, reasons, including, geographic, location, and, social, tendencies, in, colombia, for, example, citizens, value, and, celebrate, the, outdoor, environments, of, their, country, in, many, instances, they, use, outdoor, activities, as, social, gatherings, to, enjoy, nature, and, their, communities, in, bogot, colombia, a, 70, mile, stretch, of, road, known, as, the, ciclov, a, is, shut, down, each, sunday, for, bicyclists, runners, rollerbladers, skateboarders, and, other, exercisers, to, work, out, and, enjoy, their, surroundings, similarly, to, colombia, citizens, of, cambodia, tend, to, exercise, socially, outside, in, this, country, public, gyms, have, become, quite, popular, people, will, congregate, at, these, outdoor, gyms, not, only, to, use, the, public, facilities, but, also, to, organize, aerobics, and, dance, sessions, which, are, open, to, the, public, sweden, has, also, begun, developing, outdoor, gyms, called, utegym, these, gyms, are, free, to, the, public, and, are, often, placed, in, beautiful, picturesque, environments, people, will, swim, in, rivers, use, boats, and, run, through, forests, to, stay, healthy, and, enjoy, the, natural, world, around, them, this, works, particularly, well, in, sweden, due, to, its, geographical, location, exercise, in, some, areas, of, china, particularly, among, those, who, are, retired, seems, to, be, socially, grounded, in, the, mornings, square, dances, are, held, in, public, parks, these, gatherings, may, include, latin, dancing, ballroom, dancing, tango, or, even, the, jitterbug, dancing, in, public, allows, people, to, interact, with, those, with, whom, they, would, not, normally, interact, allowing, for, both, health, and, social, benefits, these, sociocultural, variations, in, physical, exercise, show, how, people, in, different, geographic, locations, and, social, climates, have, varying, motivations, and, methods, of, exercising, physical, exercise, can, improve, health, and, well, being, as, well, as, enhance, community, ties, and, appreciation, of, natural, beauty, proper, nutrition, is, as, important, to, health, as, exercise, when, exercising, it, becomes, even, more, important, to, have, a, good, diet, to, ensure, that, the, body, has, the, correct, ratio, of, macronutrients, while, providing, ample, micronutrients, to, aid, the, body, with, the, recovery, process, following, strenuous, exercise, active, recovery, is, recommended, after, participating, in, physical, exercise, because, it, removes, lactate, from, the, blood, more, quickly, than, inactive, recovery, removing, lactate, from, circulation, allows, for, an, easy, decline, in, body, temperature, which, can, also, benefit, the, immune, system, as, an, individual, may, be, vulnerable, to, minor, illnesses, if, the, body, temperature, drops, too, abruptly, after, physical, exercise, exercise, physiologists, recommend, the, 4, rs, framework, exercise, has, an, effect, on, appetite, but, whether, it, increases, or, decreases, appetite, varies, from, individual, to, individual, and, is, affected, by, the, intensity, and, duration, of, the, exercise, the, benefits, of, exercise, have, been, known, since, antiquity, dating, back, to, 65, bce, it, was, marcus, cicero, roman, politician, and, lawyer, who, stated, it, is, exercise, alone, that, supports, the, spirits, and, keeps, the, mind, in, vigor, exercise, was, also, seen, to, be, valued, later, in, history, during, the, early, middle, ages, as, a, means, of, survival, by, the, germanic, peoples, of, northern, europe, more, recently, exercise, was, regarded, as, a, beneficial, force, in, the, 19th, century, in, 1858, archibald, maclaren, opened, a, gymnasium, at, the, university, of, oxford, and, instituted, a, training, regimen, for, major, frederick, hammersley, and, 12, non, commissioned, officers, this, regimen, was, assimilated, into, the, training, of, the, british, army, which, formed, the, army, gymnastic, staff, in, 1860, and, made, sport, an, important, part, of, military, life, several, mass, exercise, movements, were, started, in, the, early, twentieth, century, as, well, the, first, and, most, significant, of, these, in, the, uk, was, the, women, s, league, of, health, and, beauty, founded, in, 1930, by, mary, bagot, stack, that, had, 166, 000, members, in, 1937, the, link, between, physical, health, and, exercise, or, lack, of, it, was, further, established, in, 1949, and, reported, in, 1953, by, a, team, led, by, jerry, morris, morris, noted, that, men, of, similar, social, class, and, occupation, bus, conductors, versus, bus, drivers, had, markedly, different, rates, of, heart, attacks, depending, on, the, level, of, exercise, they, got, bus, drivers, had, a, sedentary, occupation, and, a, higher, incidence, of, heart, disease, while,
