the, somatosensory, system, or, somatic, sensory, system, is, a, subset, of, the, sensory, nervous, system, it, has, two, subdivisions, one, for, the, detection, of, mechanosensory, information, related, to, touch, and, the, other, for, the, nociception, detection, of, pain, and, temperature, the, main, functions, of, the, somatosensory, system, are, the, perception, of, external, stimuli, the, perception, of, internal, stimuli, and, the, regulation, of, body, position, and, balance, proprioception, mechanosensory, information, includes, that, of, light, touch, vibration, pressure, and, tension, in, the, skin, much, of, this, information, belongs, to, the, sense, of, touch, which, is, a, general, somatic, sense, in, contrast, to, the, special, senses, of, sight, smell, taste, hearing, and, balance, nociceptory, information, is, that, received, from, pain, and, temperature, that, is, deemed, as, harmful, noxious, thermoreceptors, relay, temperature, information, in, normal, circumstances, nociceptors, are, specialised, receptors, for, signals, of, pain, the, sense, of, touch, in, perceiving, the, environment, uses, special, sensory, receptors, in, the, skin, called, cutaneous, receptors, they, include, mechanoreceptors, such, as, tactile, corpuscles, that, relay, information, about, pressure, and, vibration, nociceptors, and, thermoreceptors, for, temperature, perception, stimulation, of, the, receptors, activate, peripheral, sensory, neurons, that, convey, signals, to, the, spinal, cord, that, may, drive, a, responsive, reflex, and, may, also, be, conveyed, to, the, brain, for, conscious, perception, somatosensory, information, from, the, face, and, head, enter, the, brain, via, cranial, nerves, such, as, the, trigeminal, nerve, the, neural, pathways, that, go, to, the, brain, are, structured, such, that, information, about, the, location, of, the, physical, stimulus, is, preserved, in, this, way, neighboring, neurons, in, the, somatosensory, cortex, represent, nearby, locations, on, the, skin, or, in, the, body, creating, a, map, or, sensory, homunculus, tactile, signing, is, a, common, means, of, communication, used, by, people, with, deafblindness, it, is, based, on, a, sign, language, or, another, system, of, manual, communication, humans, can, communicate, specific, emotions, through, touch, alone, including, anger, fear, disgust, love, gratitude, and, sympathy, via, touch, at, much, better, than, chance, levels, the, two, different, types, of, mechanoreceptor, in, the, skin, are, termed, low, threshold, mechanoreceptors, and, high, threshold, mechanoreceptors, the, four, mechanoreceptors, in, glabrous, skin, are, low, threshold, that, respond, to, harmless, stimuli, they, are, innervated, by, four, different, afferent, fibers, high, threshold, mechanoreceptors, respond, to, harmful, stimuli, merkel, cell, nerve, endings, are, found, in, the, basal, epidermis, and, hair, follicles, they, react, to, low, vibrations, 5, 15, hz, and, deep, static, touch, such, as, shapes, and, edges, due, to, having, a, small, receptive, field, extremely, detailed, information, they, are, used, in, areas, like, fingertips, the, most, they, are, not, covered, shelled, and, thus, respond, to, pressures, over, long, periods, tactile, corpuscles, react, to, moderate, vibration, 10, 50, hz, and, light, touch, they, are, located, in, the, dermal, papillae, due, to, their, reactivity, they, are, primarily, located, in, fingertips, and, lips, they, respond, in, quick, action, potentials, unlike, merkel, nerve, endings, they, are, responsible, for, the, ability, to, read, braille, and, feel, gentle, stimuli, pacinian, corpuscles, determine, gross, touch, and, distinguish, rough, and, soft, substances, they, react, in, quick, action, potentials, especially, to, vibrations, around, 250, hz, even, up, to, centimeters, away, they, are, the, most, sensitive, to, vibrations, and, have, large, receptor, fields, pacinian, corpuscles, react, only, to, sudden, stimuli, so, pressures, like, clothes, that, are, always, compressing, their, shape, are, quickly, ignored, they, have, also, been, implicated, in, detecting, the, location, of, touch, sensations, on, handheld, tools, bulbous, corpuscles, react, slowly, and, respond, to, sustained, skin, stretch, they, are, responsible, for, the, feeling, of, object, slippage, and, play, a, major, role, in, the, kinesthetic, sense, and, control, of, finger, position, and, movement, merkel, and, bulbous, cells, slow, response, are, myelinated, the, rest, fast, response, are, not, all, of, these, receptors, are, activated, upon, pressures, that, distort, their, shape, causing, an, action, potential, the, postcentral, gyrus, is, in, the, parietal, lobe, and, its, cortex, is, the, primary, somatosensory, cortex, brodmann, areas, 3, 2, and, 1, collectively, referred, to, as, s1, ba3, receives, the, densest, projections, from, the, thalamus, ba3a, is, involved, with, the, sense, of, relative, position, of, neighboring, body, parts, and, amount, of, effort, being, used, during, movement, ba3b, is, responsible, for, distributing, somatosensory, information, it, projects, texture, information, to, ba1, and, shape, and, size, information, to, ba2, region, s2, secondary, somatosensory, cortex, divides, into, area, s2, and, parietal, ventral, area, area, s2, is, involved, with, specific, touch, perception, and, is, thus, integrally, linked, with, the, amygdala, and, hippocampus, to, encode, and, reinforce, memories, parietal, ventral, area, is, the, somatosensory, relay, to, the, premotor, cortex, and, somatosensory, memory, hub, ba5, ba5, is, the, topographically, organized, somato, memory, field, and, association, area, ba1, processes, texture, info, while, ba2, processes, size, and, shape, information, area, s2, processes, light, touch, pain, visceral, sensation, and, tactile, attention, s1, processes, the, remaining, info, crude, touch, pain, temperature, ba7, integrates, visual, and, proprioceptive, info, to, locate, objects, in, space, the, insular, cortex, insula, plays, a, role, in, the, sense, of, bodily, ownership, bodily, self, awareness, and, perception, insula, also, plays, a, role, in, conveying, info, about, sensual, touch, pain, temperature, itch, and, local, oxygen, status, insula, is, a, highly, connected, relay, and, thus, is, involved, in, numerous, functions, the, somatosensory, system, is, spread, through, all, major, parts, of, the, vertebrate, body, it, consists, both, of, sensory, receptors, and, sensory, neurons, in, the, periphery, skin, muscle, and, organs, for, example, to, deeper, neurons, within, the, central, nervous, system, all, afferent, touch, vibration, info, ascends, the, spinal, cord, via, the, dorsal, column, medial, lemniscus, pathway, via, gracilis, t7, and, below, or, cuneatus, t6, and, above, cuneatus, sends, signals, to, the, cochlear, nucleus, indirectly, via, spinal, grey, matter, this, info, is, used, in, determining, if, a, perceived, sound, is, just, villi, noise, irritation, all, fibers, cross, left, becomes, right, in, the, medulla, a, somatosensory, pathway, will, typically, have, three, neurons, first, order, second, order, and, third, order, photoreceptors, similar, to, those, found, in, the, retina, of, the, eye, detect, potentially, damaging, ultraviolet, radiation, ultraviolet, a, specifically, inducing, increased, production, of, melanin, by, melanocytes, thus, tanning, potentially, offers, the, skin, rapid, protection, from, dna, damage, and, sunburn, caused, by, ultraviolet, radiation, dna, damage, caused, by, ultraviolet, b, however, whether, this, offers, protection, is, debatable, because, the, amount, of, melanin, released, by, this, process, is, modest, in, comparison, to, the, amounts, released, in, response, to, dna, damage, caused, by, ultraviolet, b, radiation, the, tactile, feedback, from, proprioception, is, derived, from, the, proprioceptors, in, the, skin, muscles, and, joints, the, receptor, for, the, sense, of, balance, resides, in, the, vestibular, system, in, the, ear, for, the, three, dimensional, orientation, of, the, head, and, by, inference, the, rest, of, the, body, balance, is, also, mediated, by, the, kinesthetic, reflex, fed, by, proprioception, which, senses, the, relative, location, of, the, rest, of, the, body, to, the, head, in, addition, proprioception, estimates, the, location, of, objects, which, are, sensed, by, the, visual, system, which, provides, confirmation, of, the, place, of, those, objects, relative, to, the, body, as, input, to, the, mechanical, reflexes, of, the, body, fine, touch, or, discriminative, touch, is, a, sensory, modality, that, allows, a, subject, to, sense, and, localize, touch, the, form, of, touch, where, localization, is, not, possible, is, known, as, crude, touch, the, dorsal, column, medial, lemniscus, pathway, is, the, pathway, responsible, for, the, sending, of, fine, touch, information, to, the, cerebral, cortex, of, the, brain, crude, touch, non, discriminating, is, a, sensory, modality, that, allows, the, subject, to, sense, that, something, has, touched, them, without, being, able, to, localize, where, they, were, touched, contrasting, fine, touch, its, fibres, are, carried, in, the, spinothalamic, tract, unlike, the, fine, touch, which, is, carried, in, the, dorsal, column, as, fine, touch, normally, works, in, parallel, to, crude, touch, a, person, will, be, able, to, localize, touch, until, fibres, carrying, fine, touch, in, the, dorsal, column, medial, lemniscus, pathway, have, been, disrupted, then, the, subject, will, feel, the, touch, but, be, unable, to, identify, where, they, were, touched, the, somatosensory, cortex, encodes, incoming, sensory, information, from, receptors, all, over, the, body, affective, touch, is, a, type, of, sensory, information, that, elicits, an, emotional, reaction, and, is, usually, social, in, nature, such, as, a, physical, human, touch, this, type, of, information, is, actually, coded, differently, than, other, sensory, information, intensity, of, affective, touch, is, still, encoded, in, the, primary, somatosensory, cortex, and, is, processed, in, a, similar, way, to, emotions, invoked, by, sight, and, sound, as, exemplified, by, the, increase, of, adrenaline, caused, by, the, social, touch, of, a, loved, one, as, opposed, to, the, physical, inability, to, touch, someone, you, do, not, love, meanwhile, the, feeling, of, pleasantness, associated, with, affective, touch, activates, the, anterior, cingulate, cortex, more, than, the, primary, somatosensory, cortex, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, data, shows, that, increased, blood, oxygen, level, contrast, bold, signal, in, the, anterior, cingulate, cortex, as, well, as, the, prefrontal, cortex, is, highly, correlated, with, pleasantness, scores, of, an, affective, touch, inhibitory, transcranial, magnetic, stimulation, tms, of, the, primary, somatosensory, cortex, inhibits, the, perception, of, affective, touch, intensity, but, not, affective, touch, pleasantness, therefore, the, s1, is, not, directly, involved, in, processing, socially, affective, touch, pleasantness, but, still, plays, a, role, in, discriminating, touch, location, and, intensity, tactile, interaction, is, important, amongst, some, animals, usually, tactile, contact, between, two, animals, occurs, through, stroking, licking, or, grooming, these, behaviours, are, essential, for, the, individual, s, social, healthcare, as, in, the, hypothalamus, they, induce, the, release, of, oxytocin, a, hormone, that, decreases, stress, and, anxiety, and, increases, social, bonding, between, animals, more, precisely, the, consistency, of, oxytocin, neuron, activation, in, rats, stroked, by, humans, has, been, observed, especially, in, the, caudal, paraventricular, nucleus, it, was, found, that, this, affiliative, relationship, induced, by, tactile, contact, is, common, no, matter, the, relationship, between, the, two, individuals, mother, infant, male, female, human, animal, it, has, also, been, discovered, that, the, level, of, oxytocin, release, through, this, behaviour, correlates, with, the, time, course, of, social, interaction, as, longer, stroking, induced, a, greater, release, of, the, hormone, the, importance, of, somatosensory, stimulation, in, social, animals, such, as, primates, has, also, been, observed, grooming, is, part, of, the, social, interaction, primates, exert, on, their, conspecifics, this, interaction, is, required, between, individuals, to, maintain, the, affiliative, relationship, within, the, group, avoid, internal, conflict, and, increase, group, bonding, however, such, social, interaction, requires, the, recognition, of, every, member, in, the, group, as, such, it, has, been, observed, that, the, size, of, the, neocortex, is, positively, correlated, with, the, size, of, the, group, reflecting, a, limit, to, the, number, of, recognizable, members, amongst, which, grooming, can, occur, furthermore, the, time, course, of, grooming, is, related, to, vulnerability, due, to, predation, to, which, animals, are, exposed, to, whilst, performing, such, social, interaction, the, relationship, between, tactile, interaction, stress, reduction, and, social, bonding, depends, on, the, evaluation, of, risks, that, occur, during, conducting, such, behaviours, in, the, wild, life, and, further, research, is, required, to, unveil, the, connection, between, tactile, caring, and, fitness, level, studies, show, a, correlation, between, touching, a, soft, or, hard, object, and, how, a, person, thinks, or, even, makes, decisions, further, between, the, firmness, of, a, touch, and, the, evoking, of, gender, stereotyping, tactile, memories, as, part, of, haptic, memory, are, organized, somatotopically, following, the, organization, of, the, somatosensory, cortex, a, variety, of, studies, have, measured, and, investigated, the, causes, for, differences, between, individuals, in, the, sense, of, fine, touch, one, well, studied, area, is, passive, tactile, spatial, acuity, the, ability, to, resolve, the, fine, spatial, details, of, an, object, pressed, against, the, stationary, skin, a, variety, of, methods, have, been, used, to, measure, passive, tactile, spatial, acuity, perhaps, the, most, rigorous, being, the, grating, orientation, task, in, this, task, subjects, identify, the, orientation, of, a, grooved, surface, presented, in, two, different, orientations, which, can, be, applied, manually, or, with, automated, equipment, many, studies, have, shown, a, decline, in, passive, tactile, spatial, acuity, with, age, the, reasons, for, this, decline, are, unknown, but, may, include, loss, of, tactile, receptors, during, normal, aging, remarkably, index, finger, passive, tactile, spatial, acuity, is, better, among, adults, with, smaller, index, fingertips, this, effect, of, finger, size, has, been, shown, to, underlie, the, better, passive, tactile, spatial, acuity, of, women, on, average, compared, to, men, the, density, of, tactile, corpuscles, a, type, of, mechanoreceptor, that, detects, low, frequency, vibrations, is, greater, in, smaller, fingers, the, same, may, hold, for, merkel, cells, which, detect, the, static, indentations, important, for, fine, spatial, acuity, among, children, of, the, same, age, those, with, smaller, fingers, also, tend, to, have, better, tactile, acuity, many, studies, have, shown, that, passive, tactile, spatial, acuity, is, enhanced, among, blind, individuals, compared, to, sighted, individuals, of, the, same, age, possibly, because, of, cross, modal, plasticity, in, the, cerebral, cortex, of, blind, individuals, perhaps, also, due, to, cortical, plasticity, individuals, who, have, been, blind, since, birth, reportedly, consolidate, tactile, information, more, rapidly, than, sighted, people, a, somatosensory, deficiency, may, be, caused, by, a, peripheral, neuropathy, involving, peripheral, nerves, of, the, somatosensory, system, this, may, present, as, numbness, or, paresthesia, haptic, technology, can, provide, touch, sensation, in, virtual, and, real, environments, in, the, field, of, speech, therapy, tactile, feedback, can, be, used, to, treat, speech, disorders, affectionate, touch, is, present, in, everyday, life, and, can, take, multiple, forms, these, actions, however, seem, to, carry, specific, functions, even, though, the, evolutionary, benefit, from, such, a, wide, range, of, behaviours, is, not, entirely, understood, researchers, investigated, the, expression, patterns, and, characteristics, of, 8, different, affectionate, touch, actions, embracing, holding, kissing, leaning, petting, squeezing, stroking, and, tickling, in, a, self, report, study, it, was, found, that, the, affectionate, touch, has, distinct, target, areas, on, the, body, different, associated, affect, comfort, value, and, expression, frequency, based, on, the, type, of, touch, action, that, is, performed, besides, the, rather, obvious, sensory, consequences, of, touch, it, can, also, affect, higher, level, aspects, of, cognition, such, as, social, judgements, and, decision, making, this, effect, might, arise, due, to, a, physical, to, mental, scaffolding, process, in, early, development, whereby, sensorimotor, experiences, are, linked, to, the, emergence, of, conceptual, knowledge, such, links, might, be, maintained, throughout, life, and, so, touching, an, object, may, cue, the, physical, sensation, to, its, related, conceptual, processing, indeed, it, was, found, that, different, physical, properties, weight, texture, and, hardness, of, a, touched, object, can, influence, social, judgement, and, decision, making, for, example, participants, described, a, passage, of, a, social, interaction, to, be, harsher, when, they, touched, a, hard, wooden, block, instead, of, a, soft, blanket, prior, to, the, task, building, on, these, findings, the, ability, of, touch, to, have, an, unconscious, influence, on, such, higher, order, thoughts, may, provide, a, novel, tool, for, marketing, and, communication, strategies
