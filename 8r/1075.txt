maize, m, e, z, zea, mays, also, known, as, corn, in, north, american, english, is, a, tall, stout, grass, that, produces, cereal, grain, it, was, domesticated, by, indigenous, peoples, in, southern, mexico, about, 9, 000, years, ago, from, wild, teosinte, native, americans, planted, it, alongside, beans, and, squashes, in, the, three, sisters, polyculture, the, leafy, stalk, of, the, plant, gives, rise, to, male, inflorescences, or, tassels, which, produce, pollen, and, female, inflorescences, called, ears, the, ears, yield, grain, known, as, kernels, or, seeds, in, modern, commercial, varieties, these, are, usually, yellow, or, white, other, varieties, can, be, of, many, colors, maize, relies, on, humans, for, its, propagation, since, the, columbian, exchange, it, has, become, a, staple, food, in, many, parts, of, the, world, with, the, total, production, of, maize, surpassing, that, of, wheat, and, rice, much, maize, is, used, for, animal, feed, whether, as, grain, or, as, the, whole, plant, which, can, either, be, baled, or, made, into, the, more, palatable, silage, sugar, rich, varieties, called, sweet, corn, are, grown, for, human, consumption, while, field, corn, varieties, are, used, for, animal, feed, for, uses, such, as, cornmeal, or, masa, corn, starch, corn, syrup, pressing, into, corn, oil, alcoholic, beverages, like, bourbon, whiskey, and, as, chemical, feedstocks, including, ethanol, and, other, biofuels, maize, is, cultivated, throughout, the, world, a, greater, weight, of, maize, is, produced, each, year, than, any, other, grain, in, 2020, world, production, was, 1, 1, billion, tonnes, it, is, afflicted, by, many, pests, and, diseases, two, major, insect, pests, european, corn, borer, and, corn, rootworms, have, each, caused, annual, losses, of, a, billion, dollars, in, the, us, modern, plant, breeding, has, greatly, increased, output, and, qualities, such, as, nutrition, drought, tolerance, and, tolerance, of, pests, and, diseases, much, maize, is, now, genetically, modified, as, a, food, maize, is, used, to, make, a, wide, variety, of, dishes, including, mexican, tortillas, and, tamales, italian, polenta, and, american, hominy, grits, maize, protein, is, low, in, some, essential, amino, acids, and, the, niacin, it, contains, only, becomes, available, if, freed, by, alkali, treatment, in, mesoamerica, maize, is, deified, as, a, maize, god, and, depicted, in, sculptures, maize, requires, human, intervention, for, it, to, propagate, the, kernels, of, its, naturally, propagating, teosinte, ancestor, fall, off, the, cob, on, their, own, while, those, of, domesticated, maize, do, not, all, maize, arose, from, a, single, domestication, in, southern, mexico, about, 9, 000, years, ago, the, oldest, surviving, maize, types, are, those, of, the, mexican, highlands, maize, spread, from, this, region, to, the, lowlands, and, over, the, americas, along, two, major, paths, the, centre, of, domestication, was, most, likely, the, balsas, river, valley, of, south, central, mexico, maize, reached, highland, ecuador, at, least, 8000, years, ago, it, reached, lower, central, america, by, 7600, years, ago, and, the, valleys, of, the, colombian, andes, between, 7000, and, 6000, years, ago, the, earliest, maize, plants, grew, a, single, small, ear, per, plant, the, olmec, and, maya, cultivated, maize, in, numerous, varieties, throughout, mesoamerica, they, cooked, ground, and, processed, it, through, nixtamalization, by, 3000, years, ago, maize, was, central, to, olmec, culture, including, their, calendar, language, and, myths, the, mapuche, people, of, south, central, chile, cultivated, maize, along, with, quinoa, and, potatoes, in, pre, hispanic, times, before, the, expansion, of, the, inca, empire, maize, was, traded, and, transported, as, far, south, as, 40, s, in, melinquina, l, car, department, argentina, probably, brought, across, the, andes, from, chile, after, the, arrival, of, europeans, in, 1492, spanish, settlers, consumed, maize, and, explorers, and, traders, carried, it, back, to, europe, spanish, settlers, much, preferred, wheat, bread, to, maize, maize, flour, could, not, be, substituted, for, wheat, for, communion, bread, since, in, christian, belief, at, that, time, only, wheat, could, undergo, transubstantiation, and, be, transformed, into, the, body, of, christ, maize, spread, to, the, rest, of, the, world, because, of, its, ability, to, grow, in, diverse, climates, it, was, cultivated, in, spain, just, a, few, decades, after, columbus, s, voyages, and, then, spread, to, italy, west, africa, and, elsewhere, by, the, 17th, century, it, was, a, common, peasant, food, in, southern, europe, by, the, 18th, century, it, was, the, chief, food, of, the, southern, french, and, italian, peasantry, especially, as, polenta, in, italy, when, maize, was, introduced, into, western, farming, systems, it, was, welcomed, for, its, productivity, however, a, widespread, problem, of, malnutrition, soon, arose, wherever, it, had, become, a, staple, food, indigenous, americans, had, learned, to, soak, maize, in, alkali, water, made, with, ashes, and, lime, since, at, least, 1200, 1500, bc, creating, the, process, of, nixtamalization, they, did, this, to, liberate, the, corn, hulls, but, coincidentally, it, also, liberated, the, b, vitamin, niacin, the, lack, of, which, caused, pellagra, once, alkali, processing, and, dietary, variety, were, understood, and, applied, pellagra, disappeared, in, the, developed, world, the, development, of, high, lysine, maize, and, the, promotion, of, a, more, balanced, diet, have, contributed, to, its, demise, pellagra, still, exists, in, food, poor, areas, and, refugee, camps, where, people, survive, on, donated, maize, the, name, maize, derives, from, the, spanish, form, ma, z, of, the, ta, no, mahis, the, swedish, botanist, carl, linnaeus, used, the, common, name, maize, as, the, species, epithet, in, zea, mays, the, name, maize, is, preferred, in, formal, scientific, and, international, usage, as, a, common, name, because, it, refers, specifically, to, this, one, grain, unlike, corn, which, has, a, complex, variety, of, meanings, that, vary, by, context, and, geographic, region, most, countries, primarily, use, the, term, maize, and, the, name, corn, is, used, mainly, in, the, united, states, and, a, handful, of, other, english, speaking, countries, in, countries, that, primarily, use, the, term, maize, the, word, corn, may, denote, any, cereal, crop, varying, geographically, with, the, local, staple, such, as, wheat, in, england, and, oats, in, scotland, or, ireland, the, usage, of, corn, for, maize, started, as, a, shortening, of, indian, corn, in, 18th, century, north, america, the, historian, of, food, betty, fussell, writes, in, an, article, on, the, history, of, the, word, corn, in, north, america, that, o, say, the, word, corn, is, to, plunge, into, the, tragi, farcical, mistranslations, of, language, and, history, similar, to, the, british, usage, the, spanish, referred, to, maize, as, panizo, a, generic, term, for, cereal, grains, as, did, italians, with, the, term, polenta, the, british, later, referred, to, maize, as, turkey, wheat, turkey, corn, or, indian, corn, fussell, comments, that, they, meant, not, a, place, but, a, condition, a, savage, rather, than, a, civilized, grain, international, groups, such, as, the, centre, for, agriculture, and, bioscience, international, consider, maize, the, preferred, common, name, the, word, maize, is, used, by, the, un, s, food, and, agriculture, organization, and, in, the, names, of, the, international, maize, and, wheat, improvement, center, of, mexico, the, indian, institute, of, maize, research, the, maize, association, of, australia, the, national, maize, association, of, nigeria, the, national, maize, association, of, ghana, the, maize, trust, of, south, africa, and, the, zimbabwe, seed, maize, association, maize, is, a, tall, annual, grass, with, a, single, stem, ranging, in, height, from, 1, 2, m, 4, ft, to, 4, m, 13, ft, the, long, narrow, leaves, arise, from, the, nodes, or, joints, alternately, on, opposite, sides, on, the, stalk, maize, is, monoecious, with, separate, male, and, female, flowers, on, the, same, plant, at, the, top, of, the, stem, is, the, tassel, an, inflorescence, of, male, flowers, their, anthers, release, pollen, which, is, dispersed, by, wind, like, other, pollen, it, is, an, allergen, but, most, of, it, falls, within, a, few, meters, of, the, tassel, and, the, risk, is, largely, restricted, to, farm, workers, the, female, inflorescence, some, way, down, the, stem, from, the, tassel, is, first, seen, as, a, silk, a, bundle, of, soft, tubular, hairs, one, for, the, carpel, in, each, female, flower, which, develops, into, a, kernel, often, called, a, seed, botanically, as, in, all, grasses, it, is, a, fruit, fused, with, the, seed, coat, to, form, a, caryopsis, when, it, is, pollinated, a, whole, female, inflorescence, develops, into, an, ear, or, corncob, enveloped, by, multiple, leafy, layers, or, husks, the, ear, leaf, is, the, leaf, most, closely, associated, with, a, particular, developing, ear, this, leaf, and, those, above, it, contribute, over, three, quarters, of, the, carbohydrate, starch, that, fills, the, grain, the, grains, are, usually, yellow, or, white, in, modern, varieties, other, varieties, have, orange, red, brown, blue, purple, or, black, grains, they, are, arranged, in, 8, to, 32, rows, around, the, cob, there, can, be, up, to, 1200, grains, on, a, large, cob, yellow, maizes, derive, their, color, from, carotenoids, red, maizes, are, colored, by, anthocyanins, and, phlobaphenes, and, orange, and, green, varieties, may, contain, combinations, of, these, pigments, maize, has, short, day, photoperiodism, meaning, that, it, requires, nights, of, a, certain, length, to, flower, flowering, further, requires, enough, warm, days, above, 10, c, 50, f, the, control, of, flowering, is, set, genetically, the, physiological, mechanism, involves, the, phytochrome, system, tropical, cultivars, can, be, problematic, if, grown, in, higher, latitudes, as, the, longer, days, can, make, the, plants, grow, tall, instead, of, setting, seed, before, winter, comes, on, the, other, hand, growing, tall, rapidly, could, be, convenient, for, producing, biofuel, immature, maize, shoots, accumulate, a, powerful, antibiotic, substance, 2, 4, dihydroxy, 7, methoxy, 1, 4, benzoxazin, 3, one, dimboa, which, provides, a, measure, of, protection, against, a, wide, range, of, pests, because, of, its, shallow, roots, maize, is, susceptible, to, droughts, intolerant, of, nutrient, deficient, soils, and, prone, to, being, uprooted, by, severe, winds, maize, is, diploid, with, 20, chromosomes, 83, of, allelic, variation, within, the, genome, derives, from, its, teosinte, ancestors, primarily, due, to, the, freedom, of, zea, species, to, outcross, barbara, mcclintock, used, maize, to, validate, her, transposon, theory, of, jumping, genes, for, which, she, won, the, 1983, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, maize, remains, an, important, model, organism, for, genetics, and, developmental, biology, the, mads, box, motif, is, involved, in, the, development, of, maize, flowers, the, maize, genetics, and, genomics, database, is, funded, by, the, us, department, of, agriculture, to, support, maize, research, the, international, maize, and, wheat, improvement, center, maintains, a, large, collection, of, maize, accessions, tested, and, cataloged, for, insect, resistance, in, 2005, the, us, national, science, foundation, department, of, agriculture, and, the, department, of, energy, formed, a, consortium, to, sequence, the, maize, genome, the, resulting, dna, sequence, data, was, deposited, immediately, into, genbank, a, public, repository, for, genome, sequence, data, sequencing, of, the, maize, genome, was, completed, in, 2008, in, 2009, the, consortium, published, results, of, its, sequencing, effort, the, genome, 85, of, which, is, composed, of, transposons, contains, 32, 540, genes, much, of, it, has, been, duplicated, and, reshuffled, by, helitrons, a, group, of, transposable, elements, within, maize, s, dna, maize, breeding, in, prehistory, resulted, in, large, plants, producing, large, ears, modern, breeding, began, with, individuals, who, selected, highly, productive, varieties, in, their, fields, and, then, sold, seed, to, other, farmers, james, l, reid, was, one, of, the, earliest, and, most, successful, developing, reid, s, yellow, dent, in, the, 1860s, these, early, efforts, were, based, on, mass, selection, a, row, of, plants, is, grown, from, seeds, of, one, parent, and, the, choosing, of, plants, after, pollination, which, means, that, only, the, female, parents, are, known, later, breeding, efforts, included, ear, to, row, selection, c, g, hopkins, c, 1896, hybrids, made, from, selected, inbred, lines, g, h, shull, 1909, and, the, highly, successful, double, cross, hybrids, using, four, inbred, lines, d, f, jones, c, 1918, 1922, university, supported, breeding, programs, were, especially, important, in, developing, and, introducing, modern, hybrids, since, the, 1940s, the, best, strains, of, maize, have, been, first, generation, hybrids, made, from, inbred, strains, that, have, been, optimized, for, specific, traits, such, as, yield, nutrition, drought, pest, and, disease, tolerance, both, conventional, cross, breeding, and, genetic, engineering, have, succeeded, in, increasing, output, and, reducing, the, need, for, cropland, pesticides, water, and, fertilizer, there, is, conflicting, evidence, to, support, the, hypothesis, that, maize, yield, potential, has, increased, over, the, past, few, decades, this, suggests, that, changes, in, yield, potential, are, associated, with, leaf, angle, lodging, resistance, tolerance, of, high, plant, density, disease, pest, tolerance, and, other, agronomic, traits, rather, than, increase, of, yield, potential, per, individual, plant, certain, varieties, of, maize, have, been, bred, to, produce, many, ears, these, are, the, source, of, the, baby, corn, used, as, a, vegetable, in, asian, cuisine, a, fast, flowering, variety, named, mini, maize, was, developed, to, aid, scientific, research, as, multiple, generations, can, be, obtained, in, a, single, year, one, strain, called, olot, n, has, evolved, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, nitrogen, fixing, microbes, which, provides, the, plant, with, 29, 82, of, its, nitrogen, the, international, maize, and, wheat, improvement, center, cimmyt, operates, a, conventional, breeding, program, to, provide, optimized, strains, the, program, began, in, the, 1980s, hybrid, seeds, are, distributed, in, africa, by, its, drought, tolerant, maize, for, africa, project, tropical, landraces, remain, an, important, and, underused, source, of, resistance, alleles, both, those, for, disease, and, for, herbivores, such, alleles, can, then, be, introgressed, into, productive, varieties, rare, alleles, for, this, purpose, were, discovered, by, dao, and, sood, both, in, 2014, in, 2018, zerka, rashid, of, cimmyt, used, its, association, mapping, panel, developed, for, tropical, drought, tolerance, traits, to, find, new, genomic, regions, providing, sorghum, downy, mildew, resistance, and, to, further, characterize, known, differentially, methylated, regions, genetically, modified, maize, was, one, of, the, 26, genetically, engineered, food, crops, grown, commercially, in, 2016, the, vast, majority, of, this, is, bt, maize, genetically, modified, maize, has, been, grown, since, 1997, in, the, united, states, and, canada, by, 2016, 92, of, the, us, maize, crop, was, genetically, modified, as, of, 2011, herbicide, tolerant, maize, and, insect, resistant, maize, varieties, were, each, grown, in, over, 20, countries, in, september, 2000, up, to, 50, million, worth, of, food, products, were, recalled, due, to, the, presence, of, starlink, genetically, modified, corn, which, had, been, approved, only, for, animal, consumption, the, maize, genus, zea, is, relatively, closely, related, to, sorghum, both, being, in, the, pacmad, clade, of, old, world, grasses, and, much, more, distantly, to, rice, and, wheat, which, are, in, the, other, major, group, of, grasses, the, bop, clade, it, is, closely, related, to, tripsacum, gamagrass, various, grasses, e, g, fescue, ryegrass, hordeum, barley, triticum, wheat, oryza, rice, pennisetum, fountaingrasses, sorghum, sorghum, tripsacum, gamagrass, zea, mays, maize, other, zea, species, teosintes, maize, is, the, domesticated, variant, of, the, four, species, of, teosintes, which, are, its, crop, wild, relatives, the, teosinte, origin, theory, was, proposed, by, the, russian, botanist, nikolai, ivanovich, vavilov, in, 1931, and, the, american, nobel, prize, winner, george, beadle, in, 1932, 10, the, two, plants, have, dissimilar, appearance, maize, having, a, single, tall, stalk, with, multiple, leaves, and, teosinte, being, a, short, bushy, plant, the, difference, between, the, two, is, largely, controlled, by, differences, in, just, two, genes, called, grassy, tillers, 1, gt1, a0a317yez1, and, teosinte, branched, 1, tb1, q93wi2, in, the, late, 1930s, paul, mangelsdorf, suggested, that, domesticated, maize, was, the, result, of, a, hybridization, event, between, an, unknown, wild, maize, and, a, species, of, tripsacum, a, related, genus, this, has, been, refuted, by, modern, genetic, testing, in, 2004, john, doebley, identified, balsas, teosinte, zea, mays, subsp, parviglumis, native, to, the, balsas, river, valley, in, mexico, s, southwestern, highlands, as, the, crop, wild, relative, genetically, most, similar, to, modern, maize, the, middle, part, of, the, short, balsas, river, valley, is, the, likely, location, of, early, domestication, stone, milling, tools, with, maize, residue, have, been, found, in, an, 8, 700, year, old, layer, of, deposits, in, a, cave, not, far, from, iguala, guerrero, doebley, and, colleagues, showed, in, 2002, that, maize, had, been, domesticated, only, once, about, 9, 000, years, ago, and, then, spread, throughout, the, americas, maize, pollen, dated, to, 7, 300, years, ago, from, san, andres, tabasco, has, been, found, on, the, caribbean, coast, a, primitive, corn, was, being, grown, in, southern, mexico, central, america, and, northern, south, america, 7, 000, years, ago, archaeological, remains, of, early, maize, ears, found, at, guila, naquitz, cave, in, the, oaxaca, valley, are, roughly, 6, 250, years, old, the, oldest, ears, from, caves, near, tehuacan, puebla, are, 5, 450, years, old, around, 4, 500, years, ago, maize, began, to, spread, to, the, north, in, the, united, states, maize, was, first, cultivated, at, several, sites, in, new, mexico, and, arizona, about, 4, 100, years, ago, during, the, first, millennium, ad, maize, cultivation, spread, more, widely, in, the, areas, north, in, particular, the, large, scale, adoption, of, maize, agriculture, and, consumption, in, eastern, north, america, took, place, about, a, d, 900, native, americans, cleared, large, forest, and, grassland, areas, for, the, new, crop, the, rise, in, maize, cultivation, 500, to, 1, 000, years, ago, in, what, is, now, the, southeastern, united, states, corresponded, with, a, decline, of, freshwater, mussels, which, are, very, sensitive, to, environmental, changes, because, it, is, cold, intolerant, in, the, temperate, zones, maize, must, be, planted, in, the, spring, its, root, system, is, generally, shallow, so, the, plant, is, dependent, on, soil, moisture, as, a, plant, that, uses, c, 4, carbon, fixation, maize, is, a, considerably, more, water, efficient, crop, than, plants, that, use, c, 3, carbon, fixation, such, as, alfalfa, and, soybeans, maize, is, most, sensitive, to, drought, at, the, time, of, silk, emergence, when, the, flowers, are, ready, for, pollination, in, the, united, states, a, good, harvest, was, traditionally, predicted, if, the, maize, was, knee, high, by, the, fourth, of, july, although, modern, hybrids, generally, exceed, this, growth, rate, maize, used, for, silage, is, harvested, while, the, plant, is, green, and, the, fruit, immature, sweet, corn, is, harvested, in, the, milk, stage, after, pollination, but, before, starch, has, formed, between, late, summer, and, early, to, mid, autumn, field, maize, is, left, in, the, field, until, very, late, in, the, autumn, to, thoroughly, dry, the, grain, and, may, in, fact, sometimes, not, be, harvested, until, winter, or, even, early, spring, the, importance, of, sufficient, soil, moisture, is, shown, in, many, parts, of, africa, where, periodic, drought, regularly, causes, maize, crop, failure, and, consequent, famine, although, it, is, grown, mainly, in, wet, hot, climates, it, can, thrive, in, cold, hot, dry, or, wet, conditions, meaning, that, it, is, an, extremely, versatile, crop, maize, was, planted, by, the, native, americans, in, small, hills, of, soil, in, the, polyculture, system, called, the, three, sisters, maize, provided, support, for, beans, the, beans, provided, nitrogen, derived, from, nitrogen, fixing, rhizobia, bacteria, which, live, on, the, roots, of, beans, and, other, legumes, and, squashes, provided, ground, cover, to, stop, weeds, and, inhibit, evaporation, by, providing, shade, over, the, soil, sweet, corn, harvested, earlier, than, maize, grown, for, grain, grows, to, maturity, in, a, period, of, from, 60, to, 100, days, according, to, variety, an, extended, sweet, corn, harvest, picked, at, the, milk, stage, can, be, arranged, either, by, planting, a, selection, of, varieties, which, ripen, earlier, and, later, or, by, planting, different, areas, at, fortnightly, intervals, maize, harvested, as, a, grain, crop, can, be, kept, in, the, field, a, relatively, long, time, even, months, after, the, crop, is, ready, to, harvest, it, can, be, harvested, and, stored, in, the, husk, leaves, if, kept, dry, before, world, war, ii, most, maize, in, north, america, was, harvested, by, hand, this, involved, a, large, number, of, workers, and, associated, social, events, husking, or, shucking, bees, from, the, 1890s, onward, some, machinery, became, available, to, partially, mechanize, the, processes, such, as, one, and, two, row, mechanical, pickers, picking, the, ear, leaving, the, stover, and, corn, binders, which, are, reaper, binders, designed, specifically, for, maize, the, latter, produce, sheaves, that, can, be, shocked, by, hand, or, mechanical, picker, the, entire, ear, is, harvested, which, requires, a, separate, operation, of, a, maize, sheller, to, remove, the, kernels, from, the, ear, whole, ears, of, maize, were, often, stored, in, corn, cribs, sufficient, for, some, livestock, feeding, uses, today, corn, cribs, with, whole, ears, and, corn, binders, are, less, common, because, most, modern, farms, harvest, the, grain, from, the, field, with, a, combine, harvester, and, store, it, in, bins, the, combine, with, a, corn, head, with, points, and, snap, rolls, instead, of, a, reel, does, not, cut, the, stalk, it, simply, pulls, the, stalk, down, the, stalk, continues, downward, and, is, crumpled, into, a, mangled, pile, on, the, ground, where, it, usually, is, left, to, become, organic, matter, for, the, soil, the, ear, of, maize, is, too, large, to, pass, between, slots, in, a, plate, as, the, snap, rolls, pull, the, stalk, away, leaving, only, the, ear, and, husk, to, enter, the, machinery, the, combine, separates, the, husk, and, the, cob, keeping, only, the, kernels, drying, is, vital, to, prevent, or, at, least, reduce, damage, by, mould, fungi, which, contaminate, the, grain, with, mycotoxins, aspergillus, and, fusarium, spp, are, the, most, common, mycotoxin, sources, and, accordingly, important, in, agriculture, if, the, moisture, content, of, the, harvested, grain, is, too, high, grain, dryers, are, used, to, reduce, the, moisture, content, by, blowing, heated, air, through, the, grain, this, can, require, large, amounts, of, energy, in, the, form, of, combustible, gases, propane, or, natural, gas, and, electricity, to, power, the, blowers, maize, is, widely, cultivated, throughout, the, world, and, a, greater, weight, of, maize, is, produced, each, year, than, any, other, grain, in, 2020, total, world, production, was, 1, 16, billion, tonnes, led, by, the, united, states, with, 31, 0, of, the, total, table, china, produced, 22, 4, of, the, global, total, many, pests, can, affect, maize, growth, and, development, including, invertebrates, weeds, and, pathogens, maize, is, susceptible, to, a, large, number, of, fungal, bacterial, and, viral, plant, diseases, those, of, economic, importance, include, diseases, of, the, leaf, smuts, such, as, corn, smut, ear, rots, and, stalk, rots, northern, corn, leaf, blight, damages, maize, throughout, its, range, whereas, banded, leaf, and, sheath, blight, is, a, problem, in, asia, some, fungal, diseases, of, maize, produce, potentially, dangerous, mycotoxins,

crop, sweet, corn, a, genetic, variety, that, is, high, in, sugars, and, low, in, starch, is, eaten, in, the, unripe, state, as, corn, on, the, cob, raw, yellow, sweet, maize, kernels, are, composed, of, 76, water, 19, carbohydrates, 3, protein, and, 1, fat, table, in, a, 100, gram, serving, maize, kernels, provide, 86, calories, and, are, a, good, source, 10, 19, of, the, daily, value, of, the, b, vitamins, thiamin, niacin, if, freed, pantothenic, acid, b5, and, folate, maize, has, suboptimal, amounts, of, the, essential, amino, acids, tryptophan, and, lysine, which, accounts, for, its, lower, status, as, a, protein, source, the, proteins, of, beans, and, legumes, complement, those, of, maize, maize, is, a, major, source, of, animal, feed, as, a, grain, crop, the, dried, kernels, are, used, as, feed, they, are, often, kept, on, the, cob, for, storage, in, a, corn, crib, or, they, may, be, shelled, off, for, storage, in, a, grain, bin, when, the, grain, is, used, for, feed, the, rest, of, the, plant, the, corn, stover, can, be, used, later, as, fodder, bedding, litter, or, soil, conditioner, when, the, whole, maize, plant, grain, plus, stalks, and, leaves, is, used, for, fodder, it, is, usually, chopped, and, made, into, silage, as, this, is, more, digestible, and, more, palatable, to, ruminants, than, the, dried, form, traditionally, maize, was, gathered, into, shocks, after, harvesting, where, it, dried, further, it, could, then, be, stored, for, months, until, fed, to, livestock, silage, can, be, made, in, silos, or, in, silage, wrappers, in, the, tropics, maize, is, harvested, year, round, and, fed, as, green, forage, to, the, animals, baled, cornstalks, offer, an, alternative, to, hay, for, animal, feed, alongside, direct, grazing, of, maize, grown, for, this, purpose, starch, from, maize, can, be, made, into, plastics, fabrics, adhesives, and, many, other, chemical, products, corn, steep, liquor, a, plentiful, watery, byproduct, of, maize, wet,
