the, american, bullfrog, lithobates, catesbeianus, often, simply, known, as, the, bullfrog, in, canada, and, the, united, states, is, a, large, true, frog, native, to, eastern, north, america, it, typically, inhabits, large, permanent, water, bodies, such, as, swamps, ponds, and, lakes, bullfrogs, can, also, be, found, in, manmade, habitats, such, as, pools, koi, ponds, canals, ditches, and, culverts, the, bullfrog, gets, its, name, from, the, sound, the, male, makes, during, the, breeding, season, which, sounds, similar, to, a, bull, bellowing, the, bullfrog, is, large, and, is, commonly, eaten, throughout, its, range, especially, in, the, southern, united, states, where, they, are, plentiful, their, presence, as, a, food, source, has, led, to, bullfrogs, being, distributed, around, the, world, outside, of, their, native, range, bullfrogs, have, been, introduced, into, the, western, united, states, south, america, western, europe, china, japan, and, southeast, asia, in, these, places, they, are, invasive, species, due, to, their, voracious, appetite, and, the, large, number, of, eggs, they, produce, which, has, a, negative, effect, on, native, amphibians, and, other, fauna, bullfrogs, are, very, skittish, which, makes, capture, difficult, and, so, they, often, become, established, other, than, for, food, bullfrogs, are, also, used, for, dissection, in, science, classes, albino, bullfrogs, are, sometimes, kept, as, pets, and, bullfrog, tadpoles, are, often, sold, at, ponds, or, fish, stores, some, authorities, use, the, scientific, name, lithobates, catesbeiana, although, others, prefer, rana, catesbeiana, the, nuclear, genome, 5, 8gbp, of, the, north, american, bullfrog, rana, catesbeiana, was, published, in, 2017, and, provides, a, resource, for, future, ranidae, research, the, specific, name, catesbeiana, feminine, or, catesbeianus, masculine, is, in, honor, of, english, naturalist, mark, catesby, the, dorsal, upper, surface, of, the, bullfrog, has, an, olive, green, basal, color, either, plain, or, with, mottling, and, banding, of, grayish, brown, the, ventral, under, surface, is, off, white, blotched, with, yellow, or, gray, often, a, marked, contrast, in, color, is, seen, between, the, green, upper, lip, and, the, pale, lower, lip, the, teeth, are, tiny, and, are, useful, only, in, grasping, the, eyes, are, prominent, with, brown, irises, and, horizontal, almond, shaped, pupils, the, tympana, eardrums, are, easily, seen, just, behind, the, eyes, and, the, dorsolateral, folds, of, skin, enclose, them, the, limbs, are, blotched, or, banded, with, gray, the, fore, legs, are, short, and, sturdy, and, the, hind, legs, are, long, the, front, toes, are, not, webbed, but, the, back, toes, have, webbing, between, the, digits, with, the, exception, of, the, fourth, toe, which, is, unwebbed, bullfrogs, are, sexually, dimorphic, with, males, being, smaller, than, females, and, having, yellow, throats, males, have, tympana, larger, than, their, eyes, whereas, the, tympana, in, females, are, about, the, same, size, as, the, eyes, bullfrogs, measure, about, 3, 6, to, 6, in, 9, to, 15, cm, in, snout, to, vent, length, they, grow, fast, in, the, first, eight, months, of, life, typically, increasing, in, weight, from, 5, to, 175, g, 0, 18, to, 6, 17, oz, and, large, mature, individuals, can, weigh, up, to, 500, g, 1, 1, lb, in, some, cases, bullfrogs, have, been, recorded, as, attaining, 800, g, 1, 8, lb, and, measuring, up, to, 8, in, 20, cm, from, snout, to, vent, the, american, bullfrog, is, the, largest, species, of, true, frog, in, north, america, xenbase, provides, limited, support, blast, jbrowse, tracks, genome, download, for, the, bullfrog, the, bullfrog, is, originally, native, to, eastern, north, america, where, it, is, commonly, found, in, every, u, s, state, east, of, the, mississippi, river, its, natural, range, extends, from, the, eastern, canadian, maritime, provinces, to, as, far, west, as, idaho, and, texas, and, as, far, north, as, michigan, including, the, upper, peninsula, minnesota, and, montana, it, is, largely, absent, in, north, dakota, the, bullfrog, has, also, been, introduced, onto, nantucket, island, as, well, as, portions, of, the, western, u, s, including, arizona, colorado, hawaii, idaho, nevada, new, mexico, oregon, utah, washington, and, wyoming, in, these, states, it, is, considered, to, be, an, invasive, species, as, concerns, exist, that, it, may, outcompete, or, prey, upon, native, species, of, reptiles, and, amphibians, disrupting, the, delicate, ecological, balance, of, certain, areas, the, bullfrog, has, been, introduced, in, hawaii, south, america, asia, the, caribbean, and, europe, for, various, purposes, including, frog, farming, and, population, control, of, other, species, it, is, very, common, on, the, west, coast, especially, in, california, where, it, is, believed, to, pose, a, threat, to, the, california, red, legged, frog, and, is, considered, to, be, a, factor, in, the, decline, of, that, vulnerable, species, bullfrogs, have, been, found, to, feed, on, the, young, of, several, snakes, including, the, california, endemic, giant, garter, snake, a, threatened, species, in, early, 2023, the, utah, department, of, natural, resources, began, tweeting, tips, on, how, to, catch, and, cook, bullfrogs, in, an, effort, to, encourage, residents, to, help, control, the, growing, population, by, catching, the, invasive, frogs, for, food, other, countries, and, regions, into, which, the, bullfrog, has, been, introduced, include, the, extreme, south, of, british, columbia, canada, nearly, every, state, in, mexico, as, well, as, belgium, cuba, the, dominican, republic, haiti, italy, jamaica, the, netherlands, and, puerto, rico, it, is, also, found, in, argentina, brazil, china, colombia, japan, south, korea, uruguay, and, venezuela, the, reasons, for, introducing, the, bullfrog, to, these, areas, have, largely, been, intentional, either, to, provide, humans, with, a, source, of, food, or, as, biological, control, agents, in, addition, to, the, unintended, escape, of, frogs, from, breeding, establishments, or, scientific, research, facilities, captive, escapees, or, released, pets, are, also, a, possibility, conservationists, are, concerned, that, the, bullfrog, is, relatively, immune, to, the, fungal, infection, chytridiomycosis, also, called, chytrid, fungus, which, has, been, ravaging, numerous, frog, species, and, as, it, invades, new, territories, it, may, assist, in, the, spread, of, this, lethal, fungus, as, an, asymptomatic, carrier, to, the, more, susceptible, native, species, of, frog, it, encounters, the, bullfrog, breeding, season, typically, lasts, two, to, three, months, a, study, of, bullfrogs, in, michigan, showed, the, males, arriving, at, the, breeding, site, in, late, may, or, early, june, and, remaining, in, the, area, into, july, the, territorial, males, that, occupy, sites, are, usually, spaced, some, 3, to, 6, m, 9, 8, to, 19, 7, ft, apart, and, call, loudly, at, least, three, different, types, of, calls, have, been, noted, in, male, bullfrogs, under, different, circumstances, these, distinctive, calls, include, territorial, calls, made, as, threats, to, other, males, advertisement, calls, made, to, attract, females, and, encounter, calls, which, precede, combat, the, bullfrogs, have, a, prolonged, breeding, season, with, the, males, continuously, engaging, in, sexual, activity, throughout, males, are, present, at, the, breeding, pond, for, longer, periods, than, females, during, the, entire, season, increasing, their, chances, of, multiple, matings, the, sex, ratio, is, typically, skewed, toward, males, conversely, females, have, brief, periods, of, sexual, receptivity, during, the, season, in, one, study, female, sexual, activity, typically, lasted, for, a, single, night, and, mating, did, not, occur, unless, the, females, initiated, the, physical, contact, males, only, clasp, females, after, they, have, indicated, their, willingness, to, mate, this, finding, refutes, previous, claims, that, a, male, frog, will, clasp, any, proximate, female, with, no, regard, to, whether, the, female, has, consented, once, a, male, finds, a, receptive, female, he, will, clasp, onto, her, and, undergo, amplexus, reproductive, position, by, utilization, of, the, males, forelimbs, the, enlargement, of, forelimb, muscles, is, a, sexually, dimorphic, trait, seen, in, the, male, bullfrog, one, study, investigating, male, and, female, bullfrog, forelimbs, muscles, found, males, had, significantly, stronger, muscles, that, could, undergo, longer, durations, of, activity, before, the, onset, of, fatigue, the, significance, of, forelimb, sexual, dimorphism, allow, males, to, remain, in, amplexus, with, the, female, for, longer, durations, increasing, their, chance, at, reproductive, success, in, the, highly, competitive, mating, environment, these, male, and, female, behaviors, cause, male, to, male, competition, to, be, high, within, the, bullfrog, population, and, sexual, selection, for, the, females, to, be, an, intense, process, kentwood, wells, postulated, leks, territorial, polygyny, and, harems, are, the, most, likely, classifications, for, the, bullfrog, mating, system, leks, would, be, a, valid, description, because, males, congregate, to, attract, females, and, the, females, arrive, to, the, site, for, the, purpose, of, copulation, in, a, 1980, study, on, bullfrogs, in, new, jersey, the, mating, system, was, classified, as, resource, defense, polygyny, the, males, defended, territories, within, the, group, and, demonstrated, typical, physical, forms, of, defense, male, bullfrogs, aggregate, into, groups, called, choruses, the, male, chorus, behavior, is, analogous, to, the, lek, formation, of, birds, mammals, and, other, vertebrates, choruses, are, dynamic, forming, and, remaining, associated, for, a, few, days, breaking, down, temporarily, and, then, forming, again, in, a, new, area, with, a, different, group, of, males, male, movement, has, experimentally, been, noted, to, be, dynamic, in, the, michigan, study, the, choruses, were, described, as, centers, of, attraction, in, which, their, larger, numbers, enhanced, the, males, overall, acoustical, displays, this, is, more, attractive, to, females, and, also, attractive, to, other, sexually, active, males, choruses, in, this, study, were, dynamic, constantly, forming, and, breaking, up, new, choruses, were, formed, in, other, areas, of, the, site, males, moved, around, and, were, highly, mobile, within, the, choruses, a, review, of, multiple, studies, on, bullfrogs, and, other, anurans, noted, male, behavior, within, the, groups, changes, according, to, the, population, density, of, the, leks, at, higher, population, densities, leks, are, favored, due, to, the, difficulty, in, defending, individual, territories, among, a, large, population, of, males, this, variance, causes, differences, in, how, females, choose, their, mates, when, the, male, population, density, is, low, and, males, maintain, clearer, more, distinct, territories, female, choice, is, mostly, determined, by, territory, quality, when, male, population, density, is, higher, females, depend, on, other, cues, to, select, their, mates, these, cues, include, the, males, positions, within, the, chorus, and, differences, in, male, display, behaviors, among, other, determinants, social, dominance, within, the, choruses, is, established, through, challenges, threats, and, other, physical, displays, older, males, tend, to, acquire, more, central, locations, while, younger, males, were, restricted, to, the, periphery, chorus, tenure, is, the, number, of, nights, that, a, male, participates, in, the, breeding, chorus, one, study, distinguishes, between, chorus, tenure, and, dominant, tenure, dominant, tenure, is, more, strictly, defined, as, the, amount, of, time, a, male, maintains, a, dominant, status, chorus, tenure, is, restricted, due, to, increased, risk, of, predation, lost, foraging, opportunities, and, higher, energy, consumption, calling, is, postulated, to, be, energetically, costly, to, anurans, in, general, energy, is, also, expended, through, locomotion, and, aggressive, interactions, of, male, bullfrogs, within, the, chorus, to, establish, social, dominance, within, choruses, bullfrogs, demonstrate, various, forms, of, aggression, especially, through, visual, displays, posture, is, a, key, factor, in, establishing, social, position, and, threatening, challengers, territorial, males, have, inflated, postures, while, non, territorial, males, remain, in, the, water, with, only, their, heads, showing, for, dominant, territorial, males, their, elevated, posture, reveals, their, yellow, colored, throats, when, two, dominant, males, encounter, each, other, they, engage, in, a, wrestling, bout, the, males, have, their, venters, clasped, each, individual, in, an, erect, position, rising, to, well, above, water, level, the, new, jersey, study, noted, the, males, would, approach, each, other, to, within, a, few, centimeters, and, then, tilt, back, their, heads, displaying, their, brilliantly, colored, gular, sacs, the, gular, is, dichromatic, in, bullfrogs, with, dominant, and, fitter, males, displaying, yellow, gulars, the, new, jersey, study, also, reported, low, posture, with, only, the, head, exposed, above, the, water, surface, was, typical, of, subordinate, or, non, territorial, males, and, females, high, posture, was, demonstrated, by, territorial, males, which, floated, on, the, surface, of, the, water, with, their, lungs, inflated, displaying, their, yellow, gulars, males, optimize, their, reproductive, fitness, in, a, number, of, ways, early, arrival, at, the, breeding, site, prolonged, breeding, with, continuous, sexual, activity, throughout, the, season, ownership, of, a, centrally, located, territory, within, the, chorus, and, successful, movement, between, the, dynamically, changing, choruses, are, all, common, ways, for, males, to, maintain, dominant, or, territorial, status, within, the, chorus, older, males, have, greater, success, in, all, of, these, areas, than, younger, males, some, of, the, males, display, a, more, inferior, role, termed, by, many, researchers, as, the, silent, male, status, these, silent, males, adopt, a, submissive, posture, sit, near, resident, males, and, make, no, attempt, to, displace, them, the, silent, males, do, not, attempt, to, intercept, females, but, are, waiting, for, the, territories, to, become, vacant, this, has, also, been, called, the, alternate, or, satellite, male, strategy, after, selecting, a, male, the, female, deposits, eggs, in, his, territory, during, the, mating, grasp, or, amplexus, the, male, rides, on, top, of, the, female, grasping, her, just, behind, her, fore, limbs, the, female, chooses, a, site, in, shallow, water, among, vegetation, and, lays, a, batch, of, up, to, 20, 000, eggs, and, the, male, simultaneously, releases, sperm, resulting, in, external, fertilization, the, eggs, form, a, thin, floating, sheet, which, may, cover, an, area, of, 0, 5, to, 1, 0, m, 2, 5, 4, to, 10, 8, sq, ft, the, embryos, develop, best, at, water, temperatures, between, 24, and, 30, c, 75, and, 86, f, and, hatch, in, three, to, five, days, if, the, water, temperature, rises, above, 32, c, 90, f, developmental, abnormalities, occur, and, if, it, falls, below, 15, c, 59, f, normal, development, ceases, newly, hatched, tadpoles, show, a, preference, for, living, in, shallow, water, on, fine, gravel, bottoms, american, bullfrog, tadpoles, have, also, showed, a, preference, for, habitats, containing, structure, this, may, reflect, a, lesser, number, of, predators, in, these, locations, as, they, grow, they, tend, to, move, into, deeper, water, the, tadpoles, initially, have, three, pairs, of, external, gills, and, several, rows, of, labial, teeth, they, pump, water, through, their, gills, by, movements, of, the, floor, of, their, mouths, trapping, bacteria, single, celled, algae, protozoans, pollen, grains, and, other, small, particles, on, mucus, in, a, filtration, organ, in, their, pharynges, as, they, grow, they, begin, to, ingest, larger, particles, and, use, their, teeth, for, rasping, they, have, downward, facing, mouths, deep, bodies, and, tails, with, broad, dorsal, and, ventral, fins, time, to, metamorphosis, ranges, from, a, few, months, in, the, southern, part, of, the, range, to, 3, years, in, the, north, where, the, colder, water, slows, development, maximum, lifespan, in, the, wild, is, estimated, to, be, 8, to, 10, years, but, one, frog, lived, for, almost, 16, years, in, captivity, bullfrogs, are, voracious, opportunistic, ambush, predators, that, prey, on, any, small, animal, they, can, overpower, and, consume, bullfrog, stomachs, have, been, found, to, contain, rodents, small, lizards, and, snakes, other, frogs, and, toads, other, amphibians, crayfish, other, crustaceans, small, birds, scorpions, tarantulas, and, bats, as, well, as, the, many, types, of, invertebrates, such, as, snails, worms, and, insects, which, are, the, usual, food, of, ranid, frogs, these, studies, revealed, the, bullfrog, s, diet, to, be, unique, among, north, american, ranids, in, the, inclusion, of, a, large, percentage, of, aquatic, animals, such, as, fish, tadpoles, ram, s, horn, snails, and, dytiscid, beetles, as, well, as, the, aquatic, eggs, of, fish, frogs, insects, or, salamanders, cannibalism, has, been, observed, in, bullfrog, populations, in, resource, limited, environments, bullfrogs, are, able, to, capture, large, strong, prey, because, of, the, powerful, grip, of, their, jaws, after, the, initial, ranid, tongue, strike, however, there, is, a, correlation, found, with, size, of, prey, relative, to, body, size, of, the, bullfrog, juveniles, and, adults, typically, go, after, prey, that, is, relative, to, their, own, body, size, the, bullfrog, is, able, to, make, allowance, for, light, refraction, at, the, water, air, interface, by, striking, at, a, position, posterior, to, the, target, s, perceived, location, the, comparative, ability, of, bullfrogs, to, capture, submerged, prey, compared, to, that, of, the, green, frog, leopard, frog, and, wood, frog, l, clamitans, l, pipiens, and, l, sylvaticus, respectively, was, also, demonstrated, in, laboratory, experiments, prey, motion, elicits, feeding, behavior, first, if, necessary, the, frog, performs, a, single, orienting, bodily, rotation, ending, with, the, frog, aimed, towards, the, prey, followed, by, approaching, leaps, if, necessary, once, within, striking, distance, the, bullfrog, begins, its, feeding, strike, which, consists, of, a, ballistic, lunge, eyes, closed, as, during, all, leaps, that, ends, with, the, mouth, opening, at, this, stage, the, fleshy, mucus, coated, tongue, is, extended, towards, the, prey, often, engulfing, it, while, the, jaws, continue, their, forward, travel, to, close, bite, just, as, the, tongue, is, retracted, large, prey, that, do, not, fit, entirely, into, the, mouth, are, stuffed, in, with, the, hands, in, laboratory, observations, bullfrogs, taking, mice, usually, swam, underwater, with, prey, in, mouth, apparently, with, the, advantageous, result, of, altering, the, mouse, s, defense, from, counter, attack, to, struggling, for, air, asphyxiation, is, the, most, likely, cause, of, death, of, warm, blooded, prey, the, speed, of, a, bullfrog, s, tongue, strike, is, much, faster, than, it, should, be, if, muscles, were, the, only, force, behind, it, similar, to, the, tension, on, a, slingshot, pulled, all, the, way, back, when, the, frog, s, mouth, is, closed, tension, is, put, into, the, elastic, tissues, of, the, tongue, and, also, into, the, elastic, tendons, of, the, lower, jaw, when, the, frog, attacks, prey, opening, its, mouth, is, like, letting, go, of, the, slingshot, the, elastic, force, stored, up, in, both, the, tongue, and, the, jaw, are, combined, to, shoot, the, tip, of, the, tongue, toward, the, prey, much, faster, than, the, prey, s, ability, to, see, the, strike, and, evade, capture, completing, the, strike, and, retrieval, in, approximately, 0, 07, seconds, another, benefit, of, this, elastic, force, based, attack, is, that, it, is, not, dependent, on, background, temperature, a, frog, with, a, cold, body, temperature, has, muscles, that, move, more, slowly, but, it, can, still, attack, prey, with, the, same, speed, as, if, its, body, was, warm, ballistic, tongue, projection, of, the, related, leopard, frog, is, possible, due, to, the, presence, of, elastic, structures, that, allow, storage, and, subsequent, release, of, elastic, recoil, energy, this, accounts, for, the, tongue, projecting, with, higher, power, output, than, would, develop, by, muscular, action, alone, also, such, mechanism, relieves, the, tongue, s, musculature, from, physiological, constraints, such, as, limited, peak, power, output, mechanical, efficiency, and, thermal, dependence, by, uncoupling, the, activation, of, the, depressor, mandibulae, s, contractile, units, from, actual, muscular, movement, in, other, words, the, kinematic, parameters, developed, by, contribution, of, the, elastic, structures, differ, from, those, developed, by, muscular, projection, accounting, for, the, difference, in, velocity, power, output, and, thermal, dependence, bullfrogs, are, an, important, item, of, prey, to, many, birds, especially, large, herons, north, american, river, otters, lontra, canadensis, predatory, fish, and, occasionally, other, amphibians, predators, of, american, bullfrogs, once, in, their, adult, stages, can, range, from, 150, g, 5, 3, oz, belted, kingfishers, megaceryle, alcyon, to, 1, 100, lb, 500, kg, american, alligators, alligator, mississippiensis, the, eggs, and, larvae, are, unpalatable, to, many, salamanders, and, fish, but, the, high, levels, of, activity, of, the, tadpoles, may, make, them, more, noticeable, to, a, predator, not, deterred, by, their, unpleasant, taste, humans, hunt, bullfrogs, as, game, and, consume, their, legs, adult, frogs, try, to, escape, by, splashing, and, leaping, into, deep, water, a, trapped, individual, may, squawk, or, emit, a, piercing, scream, which, may, surprise, the, attacker, sufficiently, for, the, frog, to, escape, an, attack, on, one, bullfrog, is, likely, to, alert, others, in, the, vicinity, to, danger, and, they, will, all, retreat, into, the, safety, of, deeper, water, bullfrogs, may, be, at, least, partially, resistant, to, the, venom, of, copperhead, agkistrodon, contortrix, and, cottonmouth, agkistrodon, piscivorus, snakes, though, these, species, are, known, natural, predators, of, bullfrogs, as, are, northern, water, snakes, nerodia, sipedon, considering, the, invasive, nature, of, the, l, catesbeianus, multiple, traits, within, the, species, contribute, to, its, competitive, ability, the, generalist, diet, of, the, american, bullfrog, allows, for, it, to, consume, food, in, different, environments, when, observing, the, contents, of, american, bullfrog, stomachs, it, was, discovered, that, adult, bullfrogs, regularly, consume, predators, of, bullfrog, young, including, dragonfly, nymphs, garter, snakes, and, giant, water, bugs, thus, the, ecological, check, on, american, bullfrog, juveniles, in, invaded, areas, become, less, effective, l, catesbeianus, seems, to, exhibit, traits, of, immunity, or, resistance, against, the, antipredator, defenses, of, other, organisms, analysis, of, stomach, contents, from, bullfrog, populations, in, new, mexico, show, the, regular, consumption, of, wasps, with, no, conditioned, avoidance, due, to, the, wasps, stingers, along, the, colorado, river, l, catesbeianus, stomach, contents, indicate, the, ability, to, withstand, the, discomforting, spines, of, the, stickleback, fish, reports, of, american, bullfrogs, eating, scorpions, and, rattlesnakes, also, exist, analysis, of, the, american, bullfrog, s, realized, niche, at, various, sites, in, mexico, and, comparisons, with, the, niches, of, endemic, frogs, show, that, it, is, possible, that, the, american, bullfrog, capable, of, niche, shift, and, pose, a, threat, to, many, endemic, mexican, frog, species, even, those, that, are, not, currently, in, competition, with, the, american, bullfrog, in, areas, where, the, american, bullfrog, is, introduced, the, population, can, be, controlled, by, various, means, one, project, 3n, bullfrog, project, uses, sterile, triplo, d, 3n, bullfrogs, in, europe, the, american, bullfrog, is, included, since, 2016, in, the, list, of, invasive, alien, species, of, union, concern, the, union, list, this, implies, that, this, species, cannot, under, any, circumstances, be, imported, bred, transported, commercialized, or, intentionally, released, into, the, environment, in, the, whole, of, the, european, union, the, american, bullfrog, has, been, known, to, spread, the, amphibian, pathogen, batrachochytrium, dendrobatidis, among, populations, that, it, has, been, introduced, to, the, american, bullfrog, provides, a, food, source, especially, in, the, southern, and, some, areas, of, the, midwestern, united, states, the, traditional, way, of, hunting, them, is, to, paddle, or, pole, silently, by, canoe, or, flatboat, in, ponds, or, swamps, at, night, when, the, frog, s, call, is, heard, a, light, is, shone, at, the, frog, which, temporarily, inhibits, its, movement, the, frog, will, not, jump, into, deeper, water, as, long, as, it, is, approached, slowly, and, steadily, when, close, enough, the, frog, is, gigged, with, a, multiple, tined, spear, and, brought, into, the, boat, bullfrogs, can, also, be, stalked, on, land, by, again, taking, great, care, not, to, startle, them, in, some, states, breaking, the, skin, while, catching, them, is,
