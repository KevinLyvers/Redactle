the, biosphere, from, ancient, greek, b, os, life, and, spha, ra, sphere, also, called, the, ecosphere, from, ancient, greek, o, kos, settlement, house, and, spha, ra, sphere, is, the, worldwide, sum, of, all, ecosystems, it, can, also, be, termed, the, zone, of, life, on, earth, the, biosphere, which, is, technically, a, spherical, shell, is, virtually, a, closed, system, with, regard, to, matter, with, minimal, inputs, and, outputs, regarding, energy, it, is, an, open, system, with, photosynthesis, capturing, solar, energy, at, a, rate, of, around, 100, terawatts, by, the, most, general, biophysiological, definition, the, biosphere, is, the, global, ecological, system, integrating, all, living, beings, and, their, relationships, including, their, interaction, with, the, elements, of, the, lithosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere, and, atmosphere, the, biosphere, is, postulated, to, have, evolved, beginning, with, a, process, of, biopoiesis, life, created, naturally, from, non, living, matter, such, as, simple, organic, compounds, or, biogenesis, life, created, from, living, matter, at, least, some, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, in, a, general, sense, biospheres, are, any, closed, self, regulating, systems, containing, ecosystems, this, includes, artificial, biospheres, such, as, biosphere, 2, and, bios, 3, and, potentially, ones, on, other, planets, or, moons, the, term, biosphere, was, coined, in, 1875, by, geologist, eduard, suess, who, defined, it, as, the, place, on, earth, s, surface, where, life, dwells, while, the, concept, has, a, geological, origin, it, is, an, indication, of, the, effect, of, both, charles, darwin, and, matthew, f, maury, on, the, earth, sciences, the, biosphere, s, ecological, context, comes, from, the, 1920s, see, vladimir, i, vernadsky, preceding, the, 1935, introduction, of, the, term, ecosystem, by, sir, arthur, tansley, see, ecology, history, vernadsky, defined, ecology, as, the, science, of, the, biosphere, it, is, an, interdisciplinary, concept, for, integrating, astronomy, geophysics, meteorology, biogeography, evolution, geology, geochemistry, hydrology, and, generally, speaking, all, life, and, earth, sciences, geochemists, define, the, biosphere, as, being, the, total, sum, of, living, organisms, the, biomass, or, biota, as, referred, to, by, biologists, and, ecologists, in, this, sense, the, biosphere, is, but, one, of, four, separate, components, of, the, geochemical, model, the, other, three, being, geosphere, hydrosphere, and, atmosphere, when, these, four, component, spheres, are, combined, into, one, system, it, is, known, as, the, ecosphere, this, term, was, coined, during, the, 1960s, and, encompasses, both, biological, and, physical, components, of, the, planet, the, second, international, conference, on, closed, life, systems, defined, biospherics, as, the, science, and, technology, of, analogs, and, models, of, earth, s, biosphere, i, e, artificial, earth, like, biospheres, others, may, include, the, creation, of, artificial, non, earth, biospheres, for, example, human, centered, biospheres, or, a, native, martian, biosphere, as, part, of, the, topic, of, biospherics, currently, the, total, number, of, living, cells, on, the, earth, is, estimated, to, be, 10, 30, the, total, number, since, the, beginning, of, earth, as, 10, 40, and, the, total, number, for, the, entire, time, of, a, habitable, planet, earth, as, 10, 41, this, is, much, larger, than, the, total, number, of, estimated, stars, and, earth, like, planets, in, the, observable, universe, as, 10, 24, a, number, which, is, more, than, all, the, grains, of, beach, sand, on, planet, earth, but, less, than, the, total, number, of, atoms, estimated, in, the, observable, universe, as, 10, 82, and, the, estimated, total, number, of, stars, in, an, inflationary, universe, observed, and, unobserved, as, 10, 100, the, earliest, evidence, for, life, on, earth, includes, biogenic, graphite, found, in, 3, 7, billion, year, old, metasedimentary, rocks, from, western, greenland, and, microbial, mat, fossils, found, in, 3, 48, billion, year, old, sandstone, from, western, australia, more, recently, in, 2015, remains, of, biotic, life, were, found, in, 4, 1, billion, year, old, rocks, in, western, australia, in, 2017, putative, fossilized, microorganisms, or, microfossils, were, announced, to, have, been, discovered, in, hydrothermal, vent, precipitates, in, the, nuvvuagittuq, belt, of, quebec, canada, that, were, as, old, as, 4, 28, billion, years, the, oldest, record, of, life, on, earth, suggesting, an, almost, instantaneous, emergence, of, life, after, ocean, formation, 4, 4, billion, years, ago, and, not, long, after, the, formation, of, the, earth, 4, 54, billion, years, ago, according, to, biologist, stephen, blair, hedges, if, life, arose, relatively, quickly, on, earth, then, it, could, be, common, in, the, universe, every, part, of, the, planet, from, the, polar, ice, caps, to, the, equator, features, life, of, some, kind, recent, advances, in, microbiology, have, demonstrated, that, microbes, live, deep, beneath, the, earth, s, terrestrial, surface, and, that, the, total, mass, of, microbial, life, in, so, called, uninhabitable, zones, may, in, biomass, exceed, all, animal, and, plant, life, on, the, surface, the, actual, thickness, of, the, biosphere, on, earth, is, difficult, to, measure, birds, typically, fly, at, altitudes, as, high, as, 1, 800, m, 5, 900, ft, 1, 1, mi, and, fish, live, as, much, as, 8, 372, m, 27, 467, ft, 5, 202, mi, underwater, in, the, puerto, rico, trench, there, are, more, extreme, examples, for, life, on, the, planet, r, ppell, s, vulture, has, been, found, at, altitudes, of, 11, 300, metres, 37, 100, feet, 7, 0, miles, bar, headed, geese, migrate, at, altitudes, of, at, least, 8, 300, m, 27, 200, ft, 5, 2, mi, yaks, live, at, elevations, as, high, as, 5, 400, m, 17, 700, ft, 3, 4, mi, above, sea, level, mountain, goats, live, up, to, 3, 050, m, 10, 010, ft, 1, 90, mi, herbivorous, animals, at, these, elevations, depend, on, lichens, grasses, and, herbs, life, forms, live, in, every, part, of, the, earth, s, biosphere, including, soil, hot, springs, inside, rocks, at, least, 19, km, 12, mi, deep, underground, and, at, least, 64, km, 40, mi, high, in, the, atmosphere, marine, life, under, many, forms, has, been, found, in, the, deepest, reaches, of, the, world, ocean, while, much, of, the, deep, sea, remains, to, be, explored, under, certain, test, conditions, microorganisms, have, been, observed, to, survive, the, vacuum, of, outer, space, the, total, amount, of, soil, and, subsurface, bacterial, carbon, is, estimated, as, 5, 10, 17, g, the, mass, of, prokaryote, microorganisms, which, includes, bacteria, and, archaea, but, not, the, nucleated, eukaryote, microorganisms, may, be, as, much, as, 0, 8, trillion, tons, of, carbon, of, the, total, biosphere, mass, estimated, at, between, 1, and, 4, trillion, tons, barophilic, marine, microbes, have, been, found, at, more, than, a, depth, of, 10, 000, m, 33, 000, ft, 6, 2, mi, in, the, mariana, trench, the, deepest, spot, in, the, earth, s, oceans, in, fact, single, celled, life, forms, have, been, found, in, the, deepest, part, of, the, mariana, trench, by, the, challenger, deep, at, depths, of, 11, 034, m, 36, 201, ft, 6, 856, mi, other, researchers, reported, related, studies, that, microorganisms, thrive, inside, rocks, up, to, 580, m, 1, 900, ft, 0, 36, mi, below, the, sea, floor, under, 2, 590, m, 8, 500, ft, 1, 61, mi, of, ocean, off, the, coast, of, the, northwestern, united, states, as, well, as, 2, 400, m, 7, 900, ft, 1, 5, mi, beneath, the, seabed, off, japan, culturable, thermophilic, microbes, have, been, extracted, from, cores, drilled, more, than, 5, 000, m, 16, 000, ft, 3, 1, mi, into, the, earth, s, crust, in, sweden, from, rocks, between, 65, 75, c, 149, 167, f, temperature, increases, with, increasing, depth, into, the, earth, s, crust, the, rate, at, which, the, temperature, increases, depends, on, many, factors, including, the, type, of, crust, continental, vs, oceanic, rock, type, geographic, location, etc, the, greatest, known, temperature, at, which, microbial, life, can, exist, is, 122, c, 252, f, methanopyrus, kandleri, strain, 116, it, is, likely, that, the, limit, of, life, in, the, deep, biosphere, is, defined, by, temperature, rather, than, absolute, depth, on, 20, august, 2014, scientists, confirmed, the, existence, of, microorganisms, living, 800, m, 2, 600, ft, 0, 50, mi, below, the, ice, of, antarctica, earth, s, biosphere, is, divided, into, several, biomes, inhabited, by, fairly, similar, flora, and, fauna, on, land, biomes, are, separated, primarily, by, latitude, terrestrial, biomes, lying, within, the, arctic, and, antarctic, circles, are, relatively, barren, of, plant, and, animal, life, in, contrast, most, of, the, more, populous, biomes, lie, near, the, equator, experimental, biospheres, also, called, closed, ecological, systems, have, been, created, to, study, ecosystems, and, the, potential, for, supporting, life, outside, the, earth, these, include, spacecraft, and, the, following, terrestrial, laboratories, no, biospheres, have, been, detected, beyond, the, earth, therefore, the, existence, of, extraterrestrial, biospheres, remains, hypothetical, the, rare, earth, hypothesis, suggests, they, should, be, very, rare, save, ones, composed, of, microbial, life, only, on, the, other, hand, earth, analogs, may, be, quite, numerous, at, least, in, the, milky, way, galaxy, given, the, large, number, of, planets, three, of, the, planets, discovered, orbiting, trappist, 1, could, possibly, contain, biospheres, given, limited, understanding, of, abiogenesis, it, is, currently, unknown, what, percentage, of, these, planets, actually, develop, biospheres, based, on, observations, by, the, kepler, space, telescope, team, it, has, been, calculated, that, provided, the, probability, of, abiogenesis, is, higher, than, 1, to, 1000, the, closest, alien, biosphere, should, be, within, 100, light, years, from, the, earth, it, is, also, possible, that, artificial, biospheres, will, be, created, in, the, future, for, example, with, the, terraforming, of, mars
