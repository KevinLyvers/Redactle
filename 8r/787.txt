ovis, guineensis, linnaeus, 1758, ovis, strepsiceros, linnaeus, 1758, sheep, pl, sheep, or, domestic, sheep, ovis, aries, are, a, domesticated, ruminant, mammal, typically, kept, as, livestock, although, the, term, sheep, can, apply, to, other, species, in, the, genus, ovis, in, everyday, usage, it, almost, always, refers, to, domesticated, sheep, like, all, ruminants, sheep, are, members, of, the, order, artiodactyla, the, even, toed, ungulates, numbering, a, little, over, one, billion, domestic, sheep, are, also, the, most, numerous, species, of, sheep, an, adult, female, is, referred, to, as, a, ewe, j, u, yoo, an, intact, male, as, a, ram, occasionally, a, tup, a, castrated, male, as, a, wether, and, a, young, sheep, as, a, lamb, sheep, are, most, likely, descended, from, the, wild, mouflon, of, europe, and, asia, with, iran, being, a, geographic, envelope, of, the, domestication, center, one, of, the, earliest, animals, to, be, domesticated, for, agricultural, purposes, sheep, are, raised, for, fleeces, meat, lamb, hogget, or, mutton, and, milk, a, sheep, s, wool, is, the, most, widely, used, animal, fiber, and, is, usually, harvested, by, shearing, in, commonwealth, countries, ovine, meat, is, called, lamb, when, from, younger, animals, and, mutton, when, from, older, ones, in, the, united, states, meat, from, both, older, and, younger, animals, is, usually, called, lamb, sheep, continue, to, be, important, for, wool, and, meat, today, and, are, also, occasionally, raised, for, pelts, as, dairy, animals, or, as, model, organisms, for, science, sheep, husbandry, is, practised, throughout, the, majority, of, the, inhabited, world, and, has, been, fundamental, to, many, civilizations, in, the, modern, era, australia, new, zealand, the, southern, and, central, south, american, nations, and, the, british, isles, are, most, closely, associated, with, sheep, production, there, is, a, large, lexicon, of, unique, terms, for, sheep, husbandry, which, vary, considerably, by, region, and, dialect, use, of, the, word, sheep, began, in, middle, english, as, a, derivation, of, the, old, english, word, sc, ap, a, group, of, sheep, is, called, a, flock, many, other, specific, terms, for, the, various, life, stages, of, sheep, exist, generally, related, to, lambing, shearing, and, age, as, a, key, animal, in, the, history, of, farming, sheep, have, a, deeply, entrenched, place, in, human, culture, and, are, represented, in, much, modern, language, and, symbolism, as, livestock, sheep, are, most, often, associated, with, pastoral, arcadian, imagery, sheep, figure, in, many, mythologies, such, as, the, golden, fleece, and, major, religions, especially, the, abrahamic, traditions, in, both, ancient, and, modern, religious, ritual, sheep, are, used, as, sacrificial, animals, the, exact, line, of, descent, from, wild, ancestors, to, domestic, sheep, is, unclear, the, most, common, hypothesis, states, that, ovis, aries, is, descended, from, the, asiatic, o, gmelini, species, of, mouflon, the, european, mouflon, ovis, aries, musimon, is, a, direct, descendant, of, this, population, sheep, were, among, the, first, animals, to, be, domesticated, by, humankind, although, the, domestication, of, dogs, probably, took, place, 10, to, 20, thousand, years, earlier, the, domestication, date, is, estimated, to, fall, between, 11, 000, and, 9000, bc, in, mesopotamia, and, possibly, around, 7000, bc, in, mehrgarh, in, the, indus, valley, the, rearing, of, sheep, for, secondary, products, and, the, resulting, breed, development, began, in, either, southwest, asia, or, western, europe, initially, sheep, were, kept, solely, for, meat, milk, and, skins, archaeological, evidence, from, statuary, found, at, sites, in, iran, suggests, that, selection, for, woolly, sheep, may, have, begun, around, 6000, bc, and, the, earliest, woven, wool, garments, have, been, dated, to, two, to, three, thousand, years, later, sheep, husbandry, spread, quickly, in, europe, excavations, show, that, in, about, 6000, bc, during, the, neolithic, period, of, prehistory, the, castelnovien, people, living, around, ch, teauneuf, les, martigues, near, present, day, marseille, in, the, south, of, france, were, among, the, first, in, europe, to, keep, domestic, sheep, practically, from, its, inception, ancient, greek, civilization, relied, on, sheep, as, primary, livestock, and, were, even, said, to, name, individual, animals, ancient, romans, kept, sheep, on, a, wide, scale, and, were, an, important, agent, in, the, spread, of, sheep, raising, pliny, the, elder, in, his, natural, history, naturalis, historia, speaks, at, length, about, sheep, and, wool, european, colonists, spread, the, practice, to, the, new, world, from, 1493, onwards, domestic, sheep, are, relatively, small, ruminants, usually, with, a, crimped, hair, called, wool, and, often, with, horns, forming, a, lateral, spiral, they, differ, from, their, wild, relatives, and, ancestors, in, several, respects, having, become, uniquely, neotenic, as, a, result, of, selective, breeding, by, humans, a, few, primitive, breeds, of, sheep, retain, some, of, the, characteristics, of, their, wild, cousins, such, as, short, tails, depending, on, breed, domestic, sheep, may, have, no, horns, at, all, i, e, polled, or, horns, in, both, sexes, or, in, males, only, most, horned, breeds, have, a, single, pair, but, a, few, breeds, may, have, several, another, trait, unique, to, domestic, sheep, as, compared, to, wild, ovines, is, their, wide, variation, in, color, wild, sheep, are, largely, variations, of, brown, hues, and, variation, within, species, is, extremely, limited, colors, of, domestic, sheep, range, from, pure, white, to, dark, chocolate, brown, and, even, spotted, or, piebald, sheep, keepers, also, sometimes, artificially, paint, smit, marks, onto, their, sheep, in, any, pattern, or, color, for, identification, selection, for, easily, dyeable, white, fleeces, began, early, in, sheep, domestication, and, as, white, wool, is, a, dominant, trait, it, spread, quickly, however, colored, sheep, do, appear, in, many, modern, breeds, and, may, even, appear, as, a, recessive, trait, in, white, flocks, while, white, wool, is, desirable, for, large, commercial, markets, there, is, a, niche, market, for, colored, fleeces, mostly, for, handspinning, the, nature, of, the, fleece, varies, widely, among, the, breeds, from, dense, and, highly, crimped, to, long, and, hairlike, there, is, variation, of, wool, type, and, quality, even, among, members, of, the, same, flock, so, wool, classing, is, a, step, in, the, commercial, processing, of, the, fibre, depending, on, breed, sheep, show, a, range, of, heights, and, weights, their, rate, of, growth, and, mature, weight, is, a, heritable, trait, that, is, often, selected, for, in, breeding, ewes, typically, weigh, between, 45, and, 100, kilograms, 100, and, 220, lb, and, rams, between, 45, and, 160, kilograms, 100, and, 350, lb, when, all, deciduous, teeth, have, erupted, the, sheep, has, 20, teeth, mature, sheep, have, 32, teeth, as, with, other, ruminants, the, front, teeth, in, the, lower, jaw, bite, against, a, hard, toothless, pad, in, the, upper, jaw, these, are, used, to, pick, off, vegetation, then, the, rear, teeth, grind, it, before, it, is, swallowed, there, are, eight, lower, front, teeth, in, ruminants, but, there, is, some, disagreement, as, to, whether, these, are, eight, incisors, or, six, incisors, and, two, incisor, shaped, canines, this, means, that, the, dental, formula, for, sheep, is, either, 0, 0, 3, 3, 4, 0, 3, 3, or, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, there, is, a, large, diastema, between, the, incisors, and, the, molars, in, the, first, few, years, of, life, one, can, calculate, the, age, of, sheep, from, their, front, teeth, as, a, pair, of, milk, teeth, is, replaced, by, larger, adult, teeth, each, year, the, full, set, of, eight, adult, front, teeth, being, complete, at, about, four, years, of, age, the, front, teeth, are, then, gradually, lost, as, sheep, age, making, it, harder, for, them, to, feed, and, hindering, the, health, and, productivity, of, the, animal, for, this, reason, domestic, sheep, on, normal, pasture, begin, to, slowly, decline, from, four, years, on, and, the, life, expectancy, of, a, sheep, is, 10, to, 12, years, though, some, sheep, may, live, as, long, as, 20, years, sheep, have, good, hearing, and, are, sensitive, to, noise, when, being, handled, sheep, have, horizontal, slit, shaped, pupils, with, excellent, peripheral, vision, with, visual, fields, of, about, 270, to, 320, sheep, can, see, behind, themselves, without, turning, their, heads, many, breeds, have, only, short, hair, on, the, face, and, some, have, facial, wool, if, any, confined, to, the, poll, and, or, the, area, of, the, mandibular, angle, the, wide, angles, of, peripheral, vision, apply, to, these, breeds, a, few, breeds, tend, to, have, considerable, wool, on, the, face, for, some, individuals, of, these, breeds, peripheral, vision, may, be, greatly, reduced, by, wool, blindness, unless, recently, shorn, about, the, face, sheep, have, poor, depth, perception, shadows, and, dips, in, the, ground, may, cause, sheep, to, baulk, in, general, sheep, have, a, tendency, to, move, out, of, the, dark, and, into, well, lit, areas, and, prefer, to, move, uphill, when, disturbed, sheep, also, have, an, excellent, sense, of, smell, and, like, all, species, of, their, genus, have, scent, glands, just, in, front, of, the, eyes, and, interdigitally, on, the, feet, the, purpose, of, these, glands, is, uncertain, but, those, on, the, face, may, be, used, in, breeding, behaviors, the, foot, glands, might, also, be, related, to, reproduction, but, alternative, functions, such, as, secretion, of, a, waste, product, or, a, scent, marker, to, help, lost, sheep, find, their, flock, have, also, been, proposed, sheep, and, goats, are, closely, related, both, are, in, the, subfamily, caprinae, however, they, are, separate, species, so, hybrids, rarely, occur, and, are, always, infertile, a, hybrid, of, a, ewe, and, a, buck, a, male, goat, is, called, a, sheep, goat, hybrid, known, as, geep, visual, differences, between, sheep, and, goats, include, the, beard, of, goats, and, divided, upper, lip, of, sheep, sheep, tails, also, hang, down, even, when, short, or, docked, while, the, short, tails, of, goats, are, held, upwards, also, sheep, breeds, are, often, naturally, polled, either, in, both, sexes, or, just, in, the, female, while, naturally, polled, goats, are, rare, though, many, are, polled, artificially, males, of, the, two, species, differ, in, that, buck, goats, acquire, a, unique, and, strong, odor, during, the, rut, whereas, rams, do, not, the, domestic, sheep, is, a, multi, purpose, animal, and, the, more, than, 200, breeds, now, in, existence, were, created, to, serve, these, diverse, purposes, some, sources, give, a, count, of, a, thousand, or, more, breeds, but, these, numbers, cannot, be, verified, according, to, some, sources, however, several, hundred, breeds, of, sheep, have, been, identified, by, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, of, the, un, fao, with, the, estimated, number, varying, somewhat, from, time, to, time, e, g, 863, breeds, as, of, 1993, 1314, breeds, as, of, 1995, and, 1229, breeds, as, of, 2006, these, numbers, exclude, extinct, breeds, which, are, also, tallied, by, the, fao, for, the, purpose, of, such, tallies, the, fao, definition, of, a, breed, is, either, a, subspecific, group, of, domestic, livestock, with, definable, and, identifiable, external, characteristics, that, enable, it, to, be, separated, by, visual, appraisal, from, other, similarly, defined, groups, within, the, same, species, or, a, group, for, which, geographical, and, or, cultural, separation, from, phenotypically, similar, groups, has, led, to, acceptance, of, its, separate, identity, almost, all, sheep, are, classified, as, being, best, suited, to, furnishing, a, certain, product, wool, meat, milk, hides, or, a, combination, in, a, dual, purpose, breed, other, features, used, when, classifying, sheep, include, face, color, generally, white, or, black, tail, length, presence, or, lack, of, horns, and, the, topography, for, which, the, breed, has, been, developed, this, last, point, is, especially, stressed, in, the, uk, where, breeds, are, described, as, either, upland, hill, or, mountain, or, lowland, breeds, a, sheep, may, also, be, of, a, fat, tailed, type, which, is, a, dual, purpose, sheep, common, in, africa, and, asia, with, larger, deposits, of, fat, within, and, around, its, tail, breeds, are, often, categorized, by, the, type, of, their, wool, fine, wool, breeds, are, those, that, have, wool, of, great, crimp, and, density, which, are, preferred, for, textiles, most, of, these, were, derived, from, merino, sheep, and, the, breed, continues, to, dominate, the, world, sheep, industry, downs, breeds, have, wool, between, the, extremes, and, are, typically, fast, growing, meat, and, ram, breeds, with, dark, faces, some, major, medium, wool, breeds, such, as, the, corriedale, are, dual, purpose, crosses, of, long, and, fine, wooled, breeds, and, were, created, for, high, production, commercial, flocks, long, wool, breeds, are, the, largest, of, sheep, with, long, wool, and, a, slow, rate, of, growth, long, wool, sheep, are, most, valued, for, crossbreeding, to, improve, the, attributes, of, other, sheep, types, for, example, the, american, columbia, breed, was, developed, by, crossing, lincoln, rams, a, long, wool, breed, with, fine, wooled, rambouillet, ewes, coarse, or, carpet, wool, sheep, are, those, with, a, medium, to, long, length, wool, of, characteristic, coarseness, breeds, traditionally, used, for, carpet, wool, show, great, variability, but, the, chief, requirement, is, a, wool, that, will, not, break, down, under, heavy, use, as, would, that, of, the, finer, breeds, as, the, demand, for, carpet, quality, wool, declines, some, breeders, of, this, type, of, sheep, are, attempting, to, use, a, few, of, these, traditional, breeds, for, alternative, purposes, others, have, always, been, primarily, meat, class, sheep, a, minor, class, of, sheep, are, the, dairy, breeds, dual, purpose, breeds, that, may, primarily, be, meat, or, wool, sheep, are, often, used, secondarily, as, milking, animals, but, there, are, a, few, breeds, that, are, predominantly, used, for, milking, these, sheep, produce, a, higher, quantity, of, milk, and, have, slightly, longer, lactation, curves, in, the, quality, of, their, milk, the, fat, and, protein, content, percentages, of, dairy, sheep, vary, from, non, dairy, breeds, but, lactose, content, does, not, a, last, group, of, sheep, breeds, is, that, of, fur, or, hair, sheep, which, do, not, grow, wool, at, all, hair, sheep, are, similar, to, the, early, domesticated, sheep, kept, before, woolly, breeds, were, developed, and, are, raised, for, meat, and, pelts, some, modern, breeds, of, hair, sheep, such, as, the, dorper, result, from, crosses, between, wool, and, hair, breeds, for, meat, and, hide, producers, hair, sheep, are, cheaper, to, keep, as, they, do, not, need, shearing, hair, sheep, are, also, more, resistant, to, parasites, and, hot, weather, with, the, modern, rise, of, corporate, agribusiness, and, the, decline, of, localized, family, farms, many, breeds, of, sheep, are, in, danger, of, extinction, the, rare, breeds, survival, trust, of, the, uk, lists, 22, native, breeds, as, having, only, 3, 000, registered, animals, each, and, the, livestock, conservancy, lists, 14, as, either, critical, or, threatened, preferences, for, breeds, with, uniform, characteristics, and, fast, growth, have, pushed, heritage, or, heirloom, breeds, to, the, margins, of, the, sheep, industry, those, that, remain, are, maintained, through, the, efforts, of, conservation, organizations, breed, registries, and, individual, farmers, dedicated, to, their, preservation, sheep, are, herbivorous, most, breeds, prefer, to, graze, on, grass, and, other, short, roughage, avoiding, the, taller, woody, parts, of, plants, that, goats, readily, consume, both, sheep, and, goats, use, their, lips, and, tongues, to, select, parts, of, the, plant, that, are, easier, to, digest, or, higher, in, nutrition, sheep, however, graze, well, in, monoculture, pastures, where, most, goats, fare, poorly, like, all, ruminants, sheep, have, a, complex, digestive, system, composed, of, four, chambers, allowing, them, to, break, down, cellulose, from, stems, leaves, and, seed, hulls, into, simpler, carbohydrates, when, sheep, graze, vegetation, is, chewed, into, a, mass, called, a, bolus, which, is, then, passed, into, the, rumen, via, the, reticulum, the, rumen, is, a, 19, to, 38, liter, 5, to, 10, gallon, organ, in, which, feed, is, fermented, the, fermenting, organisms, include, bacteria, fungi, and, protozoa, other, important, rumen, organisms, include, some, archaea, which, produce, methane, from, carbon, dioxide, the, bolus, is, periodically, regurgitated, back, to, the, mouth, as, cud, for, additional, chewing, and, salivation, after, fermentation, in, the, rumen, feed, passes, into, the, reticulum, and, the, omasum, special, feeds, such, as, grains, may, bypass, the, rumen, altogether, after, the, first, three, chambers, food, moves, into, the, abomasum, for, final, digestion, before, processing, by, the, intestines, the, abomasum, is, the, only, one, of, the, four, chambers, analogous, to, the, human, stomach, and, is, sometimes, called, the, true, stomach, other, than, forage, the, other, staple, feed, for, sheep, is, hay, often, during, the, winter, months, the, ability, to, thrive, solely, on, pasture, even, without, hay, varies, with, breed, but, all, sheep, can, survive, on, this, diet, also, included, in, some, sheep, s, diets, are, minerals, either, in, a, trace, mix, or, in, licks, feed, provided, to, sheep, must, be, specially, formulated, as, most, cattle, poultry, pig, and, even, some, goat, feeds, contain, levels, of, copper, that, are, lethal, to, sheep, the, same, danger, applies, to, mineral, supplements, such, as, salt, licks, sheep, follow, a, diurnal, pattern, of, activity, feeding, from, dawn, to, dusk, stopping, sporadically, to, rest, and, chew, their, cud, ideal, pasture, for, sheep, is, not, lawnlike, grass, but, an, array, of, grasses, legumes, and, forbs, types, of, land, where, sheep, are, raised, vary, widely, from, pastures, that, are, seeded, and, improved, intentionally, to, rough, native, lands, common, plants, toxic, to, sheep, are, present, in, most, of, the, world, and, include, but, are, not, limited, to, cherry, some, oaks, and, acorns, tomato, yew, rhubarb, potato, and, rhododendron, sheep, are, largely, grazing, herbivores, unlike, browsing, animals, such, as, goats, and, deer, that, prefer, taller, foliage, with, a, much, narrower, face, sheep, crop, plants, very, close, to, the, ground, and, can, overgraze, a, pasture, much, faster, than, cattle, for, this, reason, many, shepherds, use, managed, intensive, rotational, grazing, where, a, flock, is, rotated, through, multiple, pastures, giving, plants, time, to, recover, paradoxically, sheep, can, both, cause, and, solve, the, spread, of, invasive, plant, species, by, disturbing, the, natural, state, of, pasture, sheep, and, other, livestock, can, pave, the, way, for, invasive, plants, however, sheep, also, prefer, to, eat, invasives, such, as, cheatgrass, leafy, spurge, kudzu, and, spotted, knapweed, over, native, species, such, as, sagebrush, making, grazing, sheep, effective, for, conservation, grazing, research, conducted, in, imperial, county, california, compared, lamb, grazing, with, herbicides, for, weed, control, in, seedling, alfalfa, fields, three, trials, demonstrated, that, grazing, lambs, were, just, as, effective, as, herbicides, in, controlling, winter, weeds, entomologists, also, compared, grazing, lambs, to, insecticides, for, insect, control, in, winter, alfalfa, in, this, trial, lambs, provided, insect, control, as, effectively, as, insecticides, sheep, are, flock, animals, and, strongly, gregarious, much, sheep, behavior, can, be, understood, on, the, basis, of, these, tendencies, the, dominance, hierarchy, of, sheep, and, their, natural, inclination, to, follow, a, leader, to, new, pastures, were, the, pivotal, factors, in, sheep, being, one, of, the, first, domesticated, livestock, species, furthermore, in, contrast, to, the, red, deer, and, gazelle, two, other, ungulates, of, primary, importance, to, meat, production, in, prehistoric, times, sheep, do, not, defend, territories, although, they, do, form, home, ranges, all, sheep, have, a, tendency, to, congregate, close, to, other, members, of, a, flock, although, this, behavior, varies, with, breed, and, sheep, can, become, stressed, when, separated, from, their, flock, members, during, flocking, sheep, have, a, strong, tendency, to, follow, and, a, leader, may, simply, be, the, first, individual, to, move, relationships, in, flocks, tend, to, be, closest, among, related, sheep, in, mixed, breed, flocks, subgroups, of, the, same, breed, tend, to, form, and, a, ewe, and, her, direct, descendants, often, move, as, a, unit, within, large, flocks, sheep, can, become, hefted, to, one, particular, local, pasture, heft, so, they, do, not, roam, freely, in, unfenced, landscapes, lambs, learn, the, heft, from, ewes, and, if, whole, flocks, are, culled, it, must, be, retaught, to, the, replacement, animals, flock, behaviour, in, sheep, is, generally, only, exhibited, in, groups, of, four, or, more, sheep, fewer, sheep, may, not, react, as, expected, when, alone, or, with, few, other, sheep, being, a, prey, species, the, primary, defense, mechanism, of, sheep, is, to, flee, from, danger, when, their, flight, zone, is, entered, cornered, sheep, may, charge, and, butt, or, threaten, by, hoof, stamping, and, adopting, an, aggressive, posture, this, is, particularly, true, for, ewes, with, newborn, lambs, in, regions, where, sheep, have, no, natural, predators, none, of, the, native, breeds, of, sheep, exhibit, a, strong, flocking, behavior, farmers, exploit, flocking, behavior, to, keep, sheep, together, on, unfenced, pastures, such, as, hill, farming, and, to, move, them, more, easily, for, this, purpose, shepherds, may, use, herding, dogs, in, this, effort, with, a, highly, bred, herding, ability, sheep, are, food, oriented, and, association, of, humans, with, regular, feeding, often, results, in, sheep, soliciting, people, for, food, those, who, are, moving, sheep, may, exploit, this, behavior, by, leading, sheep, with, buckets, of, feed, sheep, establish, a, dominance, hierarchy, through, fighting, threats, and, competitiveness, dominant, animals, are, inclined, to, be, more, aggressive, with, other, sheep, and, usually, feed, first, at, troughs, primarily, among, rams, horn, size, is, a, factor, in, the, flock, hierarchy, rams, with, different, size, horns, may, be, less, inclined, to, fight, to, establish, the, dominance, order, while, rams, with, similarly, sized, horns, are, more, so, merinos, have, an, almost, linear, hierarchy, whereas, there, is, a, less, rigid, structure, in, border, leicesters, when, a, competitive, feeding, situation, arises, in, sheep, position, in, a, moving, flock, is, highly, correlated, with, social, dominance, but, there, is, no, definitive, study, to, show, consistent, voluntary, leadership, by, an, individual, sheep, sheep, are, frequently, thought, of, as, unintelligent, animals, their, flocking, behavior, and, quickness, to, flee, and, panic, can, make, shepherding, a, difficult, endeavor, for, the, uninitiated, despite, these, perceptions, a, university, of, illinois, monograph, on, sheep, reported, their, intelligence, to, be, just, below, that, of, pigs, and, on, par, with, that, of, cattle, in, a, study, published, in, nature, in, 2001, kenneth, m, kendrick, and, others, reported, sheep, recognize, and, are, attracted, to, individual, sheep, and, humans, by, their, faces, as, they, possess, similar, specialized, neural, systems, in, the, temporal, and, frontal, lobes, individual, sheep, can, remember, 50, other, different, sheep, faces, for, over, 2, years, in, addition, to, long, term, facial, recognition, of, individuals, sheep, can, also, differentiate, emotional, states, through, facial, characteristics, if, worked, with, patiently, sheep, may, learn, their, names, and, many, sheep, are, trained, to, be, led, by, halter, for, showing, and, other, purposes, sheep, have, also, responded, well, to, clicker, training, sheep, have, been, used, as, pack, animals, tibetan, nomads, distribute, baggage, equally, throughout, a, flock, as, it, is, herded, between, living, sites, it, has, been, reported, that, some, sheep, have, apparently, shown, problem, solving, abilities, a, flock, in, west, yorkshire, england, allegedly, found, a, way, to, get, over, cattle, grids, by, rolling, on, their, backs, although, documentation, of, this, has, relied, on, anecdotal, accounts, sounds, made, by, domestic, sheep, include, bleats, grunts, rumbles, and, snorts, bleating, baaing, is, used, mostly, for, contact, communication, especially, between, dam, and, lambs, but, also, at, times, between, other, flock, members, the, bleats, of, individual, sheep, are, distinctive, enabling, the, ewe, and, her, lambs, to, recognize, each, other, s, vocalizations, vocal, communication, between, lambs, and, their, dam, declines, to, a, very, low, level, within, several, weeks, after, parturition, a, variety, of, bleats, may, be, heard, depending, on, sheep, age, and, circumstances, apart, from, contact, communication, bleating, may, signal, distress, frustration, or, impatience, however, sheep, are, usually, silent, when, in, pain, isolation, commonly, prompts, bleating, by, sheep, pregnant, ewes, may, grunt, when, in, labor, rumbling, sounds, are, made, by, the, ram, during, courting, somewhat, similar, rumbling, sounds, may, be, made, by, the, ewe, especially, when, with, her, neonate, lambs, a, snort, explosive, exhalation, through, the, nostrils, may, signal, aggression, or, a, warning, and, is, often, elicited, from, startled, sheep, in, sheep, breeds, lacking, facial, wool, the, visual, field, is, wide, in, 10, sheep, cambridge, lleyn, and, welsh, mountain, breeds, which, lack, facial, wool, the, visual, field, ranged, from, 298, to, 325, averaging, 313, 1, with, binocular, overlap, ranging, from, 44, 5, to, 74, averaging, 61, 7, in, some, breeds, unshorn, facial, wool, can, limit, the, visual, field, in, some, individuals, this, may, be, enough, to, cause, wool, blindness, in, 60, merinos, visual, fields, ranged, from, 219, 1, to, 303, 0, averaging, 269, 9, and, the, binocular, field, ranged, from, 8, 9, to, 77, 7, averaging, 47, 5, 36, of, the, measurements, were, limited, by, wool, although, photographs, of, the, experiments, indicate, that, only, limited, facial, wool, regrowth, had, occurred, since, shearing, in, addition, to, facial, wool, in, some, breeds, visual, field, limitations, can, include, ears, and, in, some, breeds, horns, so, the, visual, field, can, be, extended, by, tilting, the, head, sheep, eyes, exhibit, very, low, hyperopia, and, little, astigmatism, such, visual, characteristics, are, likely, to, produce, a, well, focused, retinal, image, of, objects, in, both, the, middle, and, long, distance, because, sheep, eyes, have, no, accommodation, one, might, expect, the, image, of, very, near, objects, to, be, blurred, but, a, rather, clear, near, image, could, be, provided, by, the, tapetum, and, large, retinal, image, of, the, sheep, s, eye, and, adequate, close, vision, may, occur, at, muzzle, length, good, depth, perception, inferred, from, the, sheep, s, sure, footedness, was, confirmed, in, visual, cliff, experiments, behavioral, responses, indicating, depth, perception, are, seen, in, lambs, at, one, day, old, sheep, are, thought, to, have, colour, vision, and, can, distinguish, between, a, variety, of, colours, black, red, brown, green, yellow, and, white, sight, is, a, vital, part, of, sheep, communication, and, when, grazing, they, maintain, visual, contact, with, each, other, each, sheep, lifts, its, head, upwards, to, check, the, position, of, other, sheep, in, the, flock, this, constant, monitoring, is, probably, what, keeps, the, sheep, in, a, flock, as, they, move, along, grazing, sheep, become, stressed, when, isolated, this, stress, is, reduced, if, they, are, provided, with, a, mirror, indicating, that, the, sight, of, other, sheep, reduces, stress, taste, is, the, most, important, sense, in, sheep, establishing, forage, preferences, with, sweet, and, sour, plants, being, preferred, and, bitter, plants, being, more, commonly, rejected, touch, and, sight, are, also, important, in, relation, to, specific, plant, characteristics, such, as, succulence, and, growth, form, the, ram, uses, his, vomeronasal, organ, sometimes, called, the, jacobson, s, organ, to, sense, the, pheromones, of, ewes, and, detect, when, they, are, in, estrus, the, ewe, uses, her, vomeronasal, organ, for, early, recognition, of, her, neonate, lamb, sheep, follow, a, similar, reproductive, strategy, to, other, herd, animals, a, group, of, ewes, is, generally, mated, by, a, single, ram, who, has, either, been, chosen, by, a, breeder, or, in, feral, populations, has, established, dominance, through, physical, contest, with, other, rams, most, sheep, are, seasonal, breeders, although, some, are, able, to, breed, year, round, ewes, generally, reach, sexual, maturity, at, six, to, eight, months, old, and, rams, generally, at, four, to, six, months, however, there, are, exceptions, for, example, finnsheep, ewe, lambs, may, reach, puberty, as, early, as, 3, to, 4, months, and, merino, ewes, sometimes, reach, puberty, at, 18, to, 20, months, ewes, have, estrus, cycles, about, every, 17, days, during, which, they, emit, a, scent, and, indicate, readiness, through, physical, displays, towards, rams, in, feral, sheep, rams, may, fight, during, the, rut, to, determine, which, individuals, may, mate, with, ewes, rams, especially, unfamiliar, ones, will, also, fight, outside, the, breeding, period, to, establish, dominance, rams, can, kill, one, another, if, allowed, to, mix, freely, during, the, rut, even, usually, friendly, rams, may, become, aggressive, towards, humans, due, to, increases, in, their, hormone, levels, after, mating, sheep, have, a, gestation, period, of, about, five, months, and, normal, labor, takes, one, to, three, hours, although, some, breeds, regularly, throw, larger, litters, of, lambs, most, produce, single, or, twin, lambs, during, or, soon, after, labor, ewes, and, lambs, may, be, confined, to, small, lambing, jugs, small, pens, designed, to, aid, both, careful, observation, of, ewes, and, to, cement, the, bond, between, them, and, their, lambs, ovine, obstetrics, can, be, problematic, by, selectively, breeding, ewes, that, produce, multiple, offspring, with, higher, birth, weights, for, generations, sheep, producers, have, inadvertently, caused, some, domestic, sheep, to, have, difficulty, lambing, balancing, ease, of, lambing, with, high, productivity, is, one, of, the, dilemmas, of, sheep, breeding, in, the, case, of, any, such, problems, those, present, at, lambing, may, assist, the, ewe, by, extracting, or, repositioning, lambs, after, the, birth, ewes, ideally, break, the, amniotic, sac, if, it, is, not, broken, during, labor, and, begin, licking, clean, the, lamb, most, lambs, will, begin, standing, within, an, hour, of, birth, in, normal, situations, lambs, nurse, after, standing, receiving, vital, colostrum, milk, lambs, that, either, fail, to, nurse, or, are, rejected, by, the, ewe, require, help, to, survive, such, as, bottle, feeding, or, fostering, by, another, ewe, most, lambs, begin, life, being, born, outdoors, after, lambs, are, several, weeks, old, lamb, marking, ear, tagging, docking, mulesing, and, castrating, is, carried, out, vaccinations, are, usually, carried, out, at, this, point, as, well, ear, tags, with, numbers, are, attached, or, ear, marks, are, applied, for, ease, of, later, identification, of, sheep, docking, and, castration, are, commonly, done, after, 24, hours, to, avoid, interference, with, maternal, bonding, and, consumption, of, colostrum, and, are, often, done, not, later, than, one, week, after, birth, to, minimize, pain, stress, recovery, time, and, complications, the, first, course, of, vaccinations, commonly, anti, clostridial, is, commonly, given, at, an, age, of, about, 10, to, 12, weeks, i, e, when, the, concentration, of, maternal, antibodies, passively, acquired, via, colostrum, is, expected, to, have, fallen, low, enough, to, permit, development, of, active, immunity, ewes, are, often, revaccinated, annually, about, 3, weeks, before, lambing, to, provide, high, antibody, concentrations, in, colostrum, during, the, first, several, hours, after, lambing, ram, lambs, that, will, either, be, slaughtered, or, separated, from, ewes, before, sexual, maturity, are, not, usually, castrated, objections, to, all, these, procedures, have, been, raised, by, animal, rights, groups, but, farmers, defend, them, by, saying, they, save, money, and, inflict, only, temporary, pain, sheep, are, the, only, species, of, mammal, except, for, humans, which, exhibit, exclusive, homosexual, behavior, about, 10, of, rams, refuse, to, mate, with, ewes, but, readily, mate, with, other, rams, and, thirty, percent, of, all, rams, demonstrate, at, least, some, homosexual, behavior, additionally, a, small, number, of, females, that, were, accompanied, by, a, male, fetus, in, utero, i, e, as, fraternal, twins, are, freemartins, female, animals, that, are, behaviorally, masculine, and, lack, functioning, ovaries, sheep, may, fall, victim, to, poisons, infectious, diseases, and, physical, injuries, as, a, prey, species, a, sheep, s, system, is, adapted, to, hide, the, obvious, signs, of, illness, to, prevent, being, targeted, by, predators, however, some, signs, of, ill, health, are, obvious, with, sick, sheep, eating, little, vocalizing, excessively, and, being, generally, listless, throughout, history, much, of, the, money, and, labor, of, sheep, husbandry, has, aimed, to, prevent, sheep, ailments, historically, shepherds, often, created, remedies, by, experimentation, on, the, farm, in, some, developed, countries, including, the, united, states, sheep, lack, the, economic, importance, for, drug, companies, to, perform, expensive, clinical, trials, required, to, approve, more, than, a, relatively, limited, number, of, drugs, for, ovine, use, however, extra, label, drug, use, in, sheep, production, is, permitted, in, many, jurisdictions, subject, to, certain, restrictions, in, the, us, for, example, regulations, governing, extra, label, drug, use, in, animals, are, found, in, 21, cfr, code, of, federal, regulations, part, 530, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, a, minority, of, sheep, owners, have, turned, to, alternative, treatments, such, as, homeopathy, herbalism, and, even, traditional, chinese, medicine, to, treat, sheep, veterinary, problems, despite, some, favorable, anecdotal, evidence, the, effectiveness, of, alternative, veterinary, medicine, has, been, met, with, skepticism, in, scientific, journals, the, need, for, traditional, anti, parasite, drugs, and, antibiotics, is, widespread, and, is, the, main, impediment, to, certified, organic, farming, with, sheep, many, breeders, take, a, variety, of, preventive, measures, to, ward, off, problems, the, first, is, to, ensure, all, sheep, are, healthy, when, purchased, many, buyers, avoid, outlets, known, to, be, clearing, houses, for, animals, culled, from, healthy, flocks, as, either, sick, or, simply, inferior, this, can, also, mean, maintaining, a, closed, flock, and, quarantining, new, sheep, for, a, month, two, fundamental, preventive, programs, are, maintaining, good, nutrition, and, reducing, stress, in, the, sheep, restraint, isolation, loud, noises, novel, situations, pain, heat, extreme, cold, fatigue, and, other, stressors, can, lead, to, secretion, of, cortisol, a, stress, hormone, in, amounts, that, may, indicate, welfare, problems, excessive, stress, can, compromise, the, immune, system, shipping, fever, pneumonic, mannheimiosis, formerly, called, pasteurellosis, is, a, disease, of, particular, concern, that, can, occur, as, a, result, of, stress, notably, during, transport, and, or, handling, pain, fear, and, several, other, stressors, can, cause, secretion, of, epinephrine, adrenaline, considerable, epinephrine, secretion, in, the, final, days, before, slaughter, can, adversely, affect, meat, quality, by, causing, glycogenolysis, removing, the, substrate, for, normal, post, slaughter, acidification, of, meat, and, result, in, meat, becoming, more, susceptible, to, colonization, by, spoilage, bacteria, because, of, such, issues, low, stress, handling, is, essential, in, sheep, management, avoiding, poisoning, is, also, important, common, poisons, are, pesticide, sprays, inorganic, fertilizer, motor, oil, as, well, as, radiator, coolant, containing, ethylene, glycol, common, forms, of, preventive, medication, for, sheep, are, vaccinations, and, treatments, for, parasites, both, external, and, internal, parasites, are, the, most, prevalent, malady, in, sheep, and, are, either, fatal, or, reduce, the, productivity, of, flocks, worms, are, the, most, common, internal, parasites, they, are, ingested, during, grazing, incubate, within, the, sheep, and, are, expelled, through, the, digestive, system, beginning, the, cycle, again, oral, anti, parasitic, medicines, known, as, drenches, are, given, to, a, flock, to, treat, worms, sometimes, after, worm, eggs, in, the, feces, has, been, counted, to, assess, infestation, levels, afterwards, sheep, may, be, moved, to, a, new, pasture, to, avoid, ingesting, the, same, parasites, external, sheep, parasites, include, lice, for, different, parts, of, the, body, sheep, keds, nose, bots, sheep, itch, mites, and, maggots, keds, are, blood, sucking, parasites, that, cause, general, malnutrition, and, decreased, productivity, but, are, not, fatal, maggots, are, those, of, the, bot, fly, and, the, blow, fly, commonly, lucilia, sericata, or, its, relative, l, cuprina, fly, maggots, cause, the, extremely, destructive, condition, of, flystrike, flies, lay, their, eggs, in, wounds, or, wet, manure, soiled, wool, when, the, maggots, hatch, they, burrow, into, a, sheep, s, flesh, eventually, causing, death, if, untreated, in, addition, to, other, treatments, crutching, shearing, wool, from, a, sheep, s, rump, is, a, common, preventive, method, some, countries, allow, mulesing, a, practice, that, involves, stripping, away, the, skin, on, the, rump, to, prevent, fly, strike, normally, performed, when, the, sheep, is, a, lamb, nose, bots, are, fly, larvae, that, inhabit, a, sheep, s, sinuses, causing, breathing, difficulties, and, discomfort, common, signs, are, a, discharge, from, the, nasal, passage, sneezing, and, frantic, movement, such, as, head, shaking, external, parasites, may, be, controlled, through, the, use, of, backliners, sprays, or, immersive, sheep, dips, a, wide, array, of, bacterial, and, viral, diseases, affect, sheep, diseases, of, the, hoof, such, as, foot, rot, and, foot, scald, may, occur, and, are, treated, with, footbaths, and, other, remedies, foot, rot, is, present, in, over, 97, of, flocks, in, the, uk, these, painful, conditions, cause, lameness, and, hinder, feeding, ovine, johne, s, disease, is, a, wasting, disease, that, affects, young, sheep, bluetongue, disease, is, an, insect, borne, illness, causing, fever, and, inflammation, of, the, mucous, membranes, ovine, rinderpest, or, peste, des, petits, ruminants, is, a, highly, contagious, and, often, fatal, viral, disease, affecting, sheep, and, goats, sheep, may, also, be, affected, by, primary, or, secondary, photosensitization, tetanus, can, also, afflict, sheep, through, wounds, from, shearing, docking, castration, or, vaccination, the, organism, also, can, be, introduced, into, the, reproductive, tract, by, unsanitary, humans, who, assist, ewes, during, lambing, a, few, sheep, conditions, are, transmissible, to, humans, orf, also, known, as, scabby, mouth, contagious, ecthyma, or, soremouth, is, a, skin, disease, leaving, lesions, that, is, transmitted, through, skin, to, skin, contact, cutaneous, anthrax, is, also, called, woolsorter, s, disease, as, the, spores, can, be, transmitted, in, unwashed, wool, more, seriously, the, organisms, that, can, cause, spontaneous, enzootic, abortion, in, sheep, are, easily, transmitted, to, pregnant, women, also, of, concern, are, the, prion, disease, scrapie, and, the, virus, that, causes, foot, and, mouth, disease, fmd, as, both, can, devastate, flocks, the, latter, poses, a, slight, risk, to, humans, during, the, 2001, fmd, pandemic, in, the, uk, hundreds, of, sheep, were, culled, and, some, rare, british, breeds, were, at, risk, of, extinction, due, to, this, of, the, 600, 300, sheep, lost, to, the, us, economy, in, 2004, 37, 3, were, lost, to, predators, while, 26, 5, were, lost, to, some, form, of, disease, poisoning, accounted, for, 1, 7, of, non, productive, deaths, other, than, parasites, and, disease, predation, is, a, threat, to, sheep, and, the, profitability, of, sheep, raising, sheep, have, little, ability, to, defend, themselves, compared, with, other, species, kept, as, livestock, even, if, sheep, survive, an, attack, they, may, die, from, their, injuries, or, simply, from, panic, however, the, impact, of, predation, varies, dramatically, with, region, in, africa, australia, the, americas, and, parts, of, europe, and, asia, predators, are, a, serious, problem, in, the, united, states, for, instance, over, one, third, of, sheep, deaths, in, 2004, were, caused, by, predation, in, contrast, other, nations, are, virtually, devoid, of, sheep, predators, particularly, islands, known, for, extensive, sheep, husbandry, worldwide, canids, including, the, domestic, dog, are, responsible, for, most, sheep, deaths, other, animals, that, occasionally, prey, on, sheep, include, felines, bears, birds, of, prey, ravens, and, feral, hogs, sheep, producers, have, used, a, wide, variety, of, measures, to, combat, predation, pre, modern, shepherds, used, their, own, presence, livestock, guardian, dogs, and, protective, structures, such, as, barns, and, fencing, fencing, both, regular, and, electric, penning, sheep, at, night, and, lambing, indoors, all, continue, to, be, widely, used, more, modern, shepherds, used, guns, traps, and, poisons, to, kill, predators, causing, significant, decreases, in, predator, populations, in, the, wake, of, the, environmental, and, conservation, movements, the, use, of, these, methods, now, usually, falls, under, the, purview, of, specially, designated, government, agencies, in, most, developed, countries, the, 1970s, saw, a, resurgence, in, the, use, of, livestock, guardian, dogs, and, the, development, of, new, methods, of, predator, control, by, sheep, producers, many, of, them, non, lethal, donkeys, and, guard, llamas, have, been, used, since, the, 1980s, in, sheep, operations, using, the, same, basic, principle, as, livestock, guardian, dogs, interspecific, pasturing, usually, with, larger, livestock, such, as, cattle, or, horses, may, help, to, deter, predators, even, if, such, species, do, not, actively, guard, sheep, in, addition, to, animal, guardians, contemporary, sheep, operations, may, use, non, lethal, predator, deterrents, such, as, motion, activated, lights, and, noisy, alarms, sheep, are, an, important, part, of, the, global, agricultural, economy, however, their, once, vital, status, has, been, largely, replaced, by, other, livestock, species, especially, the, pig, chicken, and, cow, china, australia, india, and, iran, have, the, largest, modern, flocks, and, serve, both, local, and, exportation, needs, for, wool, and, mutton, other, countries, such, as, new, zealand, have, smaller, flocks, but, retain, a, large, international, economic, impact, due, to, their, export, of, sheep, products, sheep, also, play, a, major, role, in, many, local, economies, which, may, be, niche, markets, focused, on, organic, or, sustainable, agriculture, and, local, food, customers, especially, in, developing, countries, such, flocks, may, be, a, part, of, subsistence, agriculture, rather, than, a, system, of, trade, sheep, themselves, may, be, a, medium, of, trade, in, barter, economies, domestic, sheep, provide, a, wide, array, of, raw, materials, wool, was, one, of, the, first, textiles, although, in, the, late, 20th, century, wool, prices, began, to, fall, dramatically, as, the, result, of, the, popularity, and, cheap, prices, for, synthetic, fabrics, for, many, sheep, owners, the, cost, of, shearing, is, greater, than, the, possible, profit, from, the, fleece, making, subsisting, on, wool, production, alone, practically, impossible, without, farm, subsidies, fleeces, are, used, as, material, in, making, alternative, products, such, as, wool, insulation, in, the, 21st, century, the, sale, of, meat, is, the, most, profitable, enterprise, in, the, sheep, industry, even, though, far, less, sheep, meat, is, consumed, than, chicken, pork, or, beef, sheepskin, is, likewise, used, for, making, clothes, footwear, rugs, and, other, products, byproducts, from, the, slaughter, of, sheep, are, also, of, value, sheep, tallow, can, be, used, in, candle, and, soap, making, sheep, bone, and, cartilage, has, been, used, to, furnish, carved, items, such, as, dice, and, buttons, as, well, as, rendered, glue, and, gelatin, sheep, intestine, can, be, formed, into, sausage, casings, and, lamb, intestine, has, been, formed, into, surgical, sutures, as, well, as, strings, for, musical, instruments, and, tennis, rackets, sheep, droppings, which, are, high, in, cellulose, have, even, been, sterilized, and, mixed, with, traditional, pulp, materials, to, make, paper, of, all, sheep, byproducts, perhaps, the, most, valuable, is, lanolin, the, waterproof, fatty, substance, found, naturally, in, sheep, s, wool, and, used, as, a, base, for, innumerable, cosmetics, and, other, products, some, farmers, who, keep, sheep, also, make, a, profit, from, live, sheep, providing, lambs, for, youth, programs, such, as, 4, h, and, competition, at, agricultural, shows, is, often, a, dependable, avenue, for, the, sale, of, sheep, farmers, may, also, choose, to, focus, on, a, particular, breed, of, sheep, in, order, to, sell, registered, purebred, animals, as, well, as, provide, a, ram, rental, service, for, breeding, a, new, option, for, deriving, profit, from, live, sheep, is, the, rental, of, flocks, for, grazing, these, mowing, services, are, hired, in, order, to, keep, unwanted, vegetation, down, in, public, spaces, and, to, lessen, fire, hazard, despite, the, falling, demand, and, price, for, sheep, products, in, many, markets, sheep, have, distinct, economic, advantages, when, compared, with, other, livestock, they, do, not, require, expensive, housing, such, as, that, used, in, the, intensive, farming, of, chickens, or, pigs, they, are, an, efficient, use, of, land, roughly, six, sheep, can, be, kept, on, the, amount, that, would, suffice, for, a, single, cow, or, horse, sheep, can, also, consume, plants, such, as, noxious, weeds, that, most, other, animals, will, not, touch, and, produce, more, young, at, a, faster, rate, also, in, contrast, to, most, livestock, species, the, cost, of, raising, sheep, is, not, necessarily, tied, to, the, price, of, feed, crops, such, as, grain, soybeans, and, corn, combined, with, the, lower, cost, of, quality, sheep, all, these, factors, combine, to, equal, a, lower, overhead, for, sheep, producers, thus, entailing, a, higher, profitability, potential, for, the, small, farmer, sheep, are, especially, beneficial, for, independent, producers, including, family, farms, with, limited, resources, as, the, sheep, industry, is, one, of, the, few, types, of, animal, agriculture, that, has, not, been, vertically, integrated, by, agribusiness, however, small, flocks, from, 10, to, 50, ewes, often, are, not, profitable, because, they, tend, to, be, poorly, managed, the, primary, reason, is, that, mechanization, is, not, feasible, so, return, per, hour, of, labor, is, not, maximized, small, farm, flocks, generally, are, used, simply, to, control, weeds, on, irrigation, ditches, or, maintained, as, a, hobby, sheep, meat, and, milk, were, one, of, the, earliest, staple, proteins, consumed, by, human, civilization, after, the, transition, from, hunting, and, gathering, to, agriculture, sheep, meat, prepared, for, food, is, known, as, either, mutton, or, lamb, and, approximately, 540, million, sheep, are, slaughtered, each, year, for, meat, worldwide, mutton, is, derived, from, the, old, french, moton, which, was, the, word, for, sheep, used, by, the, anglo, norman, rulers, of, much, of, the, british, isles, in, the, middle, ages, this, became, the, name, for, sheep, meat, in, english, while, the, old, english, word, sceap, was, kept, for, the, live, animal, throughout, modern, history, mutton, has, been, limited, to, the, meat, of, mature, sheep, usually, at, least, two, years, of, age, lamb, is, used, for, that, of, immature, sheep, less, than, a, year, in, the, 21st, century, the, nations, with, the, highest, consumption, of, sheep, meat, are, the, arab, states, of, the, persian, gulf, new, zealand, australia, greece, uruguay, the, united, kingdom, and, ireland, these, countries, eat, 14, 40, lbs, 3, 18, kg, of, sheep, meat, per, capita, per, annum, sheep, meat, is, also, popular, in, france, africa, especially, the, arab, world, the, caribbean, the, rest, of, the, middle, east, india, and, parts, of, china, this, often, reflects, a, history, of, sheep, production, in, these, countries, in, particular, dishes, comprising, alternative, cuts, and, offal, may, be, popular, or, traditional, sheep, testicles, called, animelles, or, lamb, fries, are, considered, a, delicacy, in, many, parts, of, the, world, perhaps, the, most, unusual, dish, of, sheep, meat, is, the, scottish, haggis, composed, of, various, sheep, innards, cooked, along, with, oatmeal, and, chopped, onions, inside, its, stomach, in, comparison, countries, such, as, the, u, s, consume, only, a, pound, or, less, under, 0, 5, kg, with, americans, eating, 50, pounds, 22, kg, of, pork, and, 65, pounds, 29, kg, of, beef, in, addition, such, countries, rarely, eat, mutton, and, may, favor, the, more, expensive, cuts, of, lamb, mostly, lamb, chops, and, leg, of, lamb, though, sheep, s, milk, may, be, drunk, rarely, in, fresh, form, today, it, is, used, predominantly, in, cheese, and, yogurt, making, sheep, have, only, two, teats, and, produce, a, far, smaller, volume, of, milk, than, cows, however, as, sheep, s, milk, contains, far, more, fat, solids, and, minerals, than, cow, s, milk, it, is, ideal, for, the, cheese, making, process, it, also, resists, contamination, during, cooling, better, because, of, its, much, higher, calcium, content, well, known, cheeses, made, from, sheep, milk, include, the, feta, of, bulgaria, and, greece, roquefort, of, france,
