in, agriculture, grazing, is, a, method, of, animal, husbandry, whereby, domestic, livestock, are, allowed, outdoors, to, free, range, roam, around, and, consume, wild, vegetations, in, order, to, convert, the, otherwise, indigestible, by, human, gut, cellulose, within, grass, and, other, forages, into, meat, milk, wool, and, other, animal, products, often, on, land, that, is, unsuitable, for, arable, farming, farmers, may, employ, many, different, strategies, of, grazing, for, optimum, production, grazing, may, be, continuous, seasonal, or, rotational, within, a, grazing, period, longer, rotations, are, found, in, ley, farming, alternating, arable, and, fodder, crops, in, rest, rotation, deferred, rotation, and, mob, grazing, giving, grasses, a, longer, time, to, recover, or, leaving, land, fallow, patch, burn, sets, up, a, rotation, of, fresh, grass, after, burning, with, two, years, of, rest, conservation, grazing, proposes, to, use, grazing, animals, to, improve, the, biodiversity, of, a, site, grazing, has, existed, since, the, beginning, of, agriculture, sheep, and, goats, were, domesticated, by, nomads, before, the, first, permanent, settlements, were, constructed, around, 7000, bc, enabling, cattle, and, pigs, to, be, kept, livestock, grazing, contributes, to, many, negative, effects, on, the, environment, including, deforestation, extinction, of, native, wildlife, pollution, of, streams, and, rivers, overgrazing, soil, degradation, ecological, disturbance, desertification, and, ecosystem, stability, sheep, goats, cattle, and, pigs, were, domesticated, early, in, the, history, of, agriculture, sheep, were, domesticated, first, soon, followed, by, goats, both, species, were, suitable, for, nomadic, peoples, cattle, and, pigs, were, domesticated, somewhat, later, around, 7000, bc, once, people, started, to, live, in, fixed, settlements, in, america, livestock, were, grazed, on, public, land, from, the, civil, war, the, taylor, grazing, act, of, 1934, was, enacted, after, the, great, depression, to, regulate, the, use, of, public, land, for, grazing, purposes, according, to, a, report, by, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, about, 60, of, the, world, s, grassland, just, less, than, half, of, the, world, s, usable, surface, is, covered, by, grazing, systems, it, states, that, grazing, systems, supply, about, 9, percent, of, the, world, s, production, of, beef, and, about, 30, percent, of, the, world, s, production, of, sheep, and, goat, meat, for, an, estimated, 100, million, people, in, arid, areas, and, probably, a, similar, number, in, other, zones, grazing, livestock, is, the, only, possible, source, of, livelihood, grazing, management, has, two, overall, goals, a, proper, land, use, and, grazing, management, technique, balances, it, does, this, by, allowing, sufficient, recovery, periods, for, regrowth, producers, can, keep, a, low, density, on, a, pasture, so, as, not, to, overgraze, controlled, burning, of, the, land, can, help, in, the, regrowth, of, plants, although, grazing, can, be, problematic, for, the, ecosystem, well, managed, grazing, techniques, can, reverse, damage, and, improve, the, land, on, commons, in, england, and, wales, rights, of, pasture, grassland, grazing, and, pannage, forest, grazing, for, each, commoner, are, tightly, defined, by, number, and, type, of, animal, and, by, the, time, of, year, when, certain, rights, can, be, exercised, for, example, the, occupier, of, a, particular, cottage, might, be, allowed, to, graze, fifteen, cattle, four, horses, ponies, or, donkeys, and, fifty, geese, while, the, numbers, allowed, for, their, neighbours, would, probably, be, different, on, some, commons, such, as, the, new, forest, and, adjoining, commons, the, rights, are, not, limited, by, numbers, and, instead, a, marking, fee, is, paid, each, year, for, each, animal, turned, out, however, if, excessive, use, was, made, of, the, common, for, example, in, overgrazing, a, common, would, be, stinted, that, is, a, limit, would, be, put, on, the, number, of, animals, each, commoner, was, allowed, to, graze, these, regulations, were, responsive, to, demographic, and, economic, pressure, thus, rather, than, let, a, common, become, degraded, access, was, restricted, even, further, ranchers, and, range, science, researchers, have, developed, grazing, systems, to, improve, sustainable, forage, production, for, livestock, these, can, be, contrasted, with, intensive, animal, farming, on, feedlots, with, continuous, grazing, livestock, is, allowed, access, to, the, same, grazing, area, throughout, the, year, seasonal, grazing, incorporates, grazing, animals, on, a, particular, area, for, only, part, of, the, year, this, allows, the, land, that, is, not, being, grazed, to, rest, and, allow, for, new, forage, to, grow, rotational, grazing, involves, dividing, the, range, into, several, pastures, and, then, grazing, each, in, sequence, throughout, the, grazing, period, utilizing, rotational, grazing, can, improve, livestock, distribution, while, incorporating, rest, period, for, new, forage, in, ley, farming, pastures, are, not, permanently, planted, but, alternated, between, fodder, crops, and, arable, crops, rest, rotation, grazing, divides, the, range, into, at, least, four, pastures, one, pasture, remains, rested, throughout, the, year, and, grazing, is, rotated, amongst, the, residual, pastures, this, grazing, system, can, be, especially, beneficial, when, using, sensitive, grass, that, requires, time, for, rest, and, regrowth, deferred, rotation, involves, at, least, two, pastures, with, one, not, grazed, until, after, seed, set, by, using, deferred, rotation, grasses, can, achieve, maximum, growth, during, the, period, when, no, grazing, occurs, patch, burn, grazing, burns, a, third, of, a, pasture, each, year, no, matter, the, size, of, the, pasture, this, burned, patch, attracts, grazers, cattle, or, bison, that, graze, the, area, heavily, because, of, the, fresh, grasses, that, grow, as, a, result, the, other, patches, receive, little, to, no, grazing, during, the, next, two, years, the, next, two, patches, are, burned, consecutively, then, the, cycle, begins, anew, in, this, way, patches, receive, two, years, of, rest, and, recovery, from, the, heavy, grazing, this, technique, results, in, a, diversity, of, habitats, that, different, prairie, plants, and, birds, can, utilize, mimicking, the, effects, of, the, pre, historical, relationship, between, bison, and, fire, whereby, bison, heavily, graze, one, area, and, other, areas, have, opportunity, to, rest, based, on, the, concept, of, pyric, herbivory, the, tallgrass, prairie, preserve, in, northeastern, oklahoma, has, been, patch, burn, grazed, with, bison, herds, for, over, ten, years, these, efforts, have, effectively, restored, the, bison, fire, relationship, on, a, large, landscape, scale, of, 30, 000, acres, 12, 000, ha, in, the, grazed, heathland, of, devon, the, periodic, burning, is, known, as, swailing, riparian, area, grazing, is, intended, to, improve, wildlife, and, their, habitats, it, uses, fencing, to, keep, livestock, off, ranges, near, streams, or, water, areas, until, after, wildlife, or, waterfowl, periods, or, to, limit, the, amount, of, grazing, to, a, short, period, of, time, conservation, grazing, is, the, use, of, grazing, animals, to, help, improve, the, biodiversity, of, a, site, due, to, their, hardy, nature, rare, and, native, breeds, are, often, used, in, conservation, grazing, in, some, cases, to, re, establish, traditional, hay, meadows, cattle, such, as, the, english, longhorn, and, highland, are, used, to, provide, grazing, a, form, of, rotational, grazing, using, as, many, small, paddocks, as, fencing, allows, said, to, be, more, sustainable, mob, grazing, is, a, system, said, to, be, more, sustainable, invented, in, 2002, it, uses, very, large, herds, on, land, left, fallow, longer, than, usual, a, number, of, ecological, effects, derive, from, grazing, and, these, may, be, either, positive, or, negative, negative, effects, of, grazing, may, include, overgrazing, increased, soil, erosion, compaction, and, degradation, deforestation, biodiversity, loss, and, adverse, water, quality, impacts, from, run, off, sometimes, grazers, can, have, beneficial, environmental, effects, such, as, improving, the, soil, with, nutrient, redistribution, and, aerating, the, soil, by, trampling, and, by, controlling, fire, and, increasing, biodiversity, by, removing, biomass, controlling, shrub, growth, and, dispersing, seeds, in, some, habitats, appropriate, levels, of, grazing, may, be, effective, in, restoring, or, maintaining, native, grass, and, herb, diversity, in, rangeland, that, has, been, disturbed, by, overgrazing, lack, of, grazing, such, as, by, the, removal, of, wild, grazing, animals, or, by, other, human, disturbance, conservation, grazing, is, the, use, of, grazers, to, manage, such, habitats, often, to, replicate, the, ecological, effects, of, the, wild, relatives, of, domestic, livestock, or, those, of, other, species, now, absent, or, extinct, grazer, urine, and, faeces, recycle, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and, other, plant, nutrients, and, return, them, to, the, soil, grazing, can, reduce, the, accumulation, of, litter, organic, matter, in, some, seasons, and, areas, but, can, also, increase, it, which, may, help, to, combat, soil, erosion, this, acts, as, nutrition, for, insects, and, organisms, found, within, the, soil, these, organisms, aid, in, carbon, sequestration, and, water, filtration, when, grass, is, grazed, dead, grass, and, litter, are, reduced, which, is, advantageous, for, birds, such, as, waterfowl, grazing, can, increase, biodiversity, without, grazing, many, of, the, same, grasses, grow, for, example, brome, and, bluegrass, consequently, producing, a, monoculture, the, ecosystems, of, north, american, tallgrass, prairies, are, controlled, to, a, large, extent, by, nitrogen, availability, which, is, itself, controlled, by, interactions, between, fires, and, grazing, by, large, herbivores, fires, in, spring, enhance, growth, of, certain, grasses, and, herbivores, preferentially, graze, these, grasses, producing, a, system, of, checks, and, balances, and, allowing, higher, plant, biodiversity, in, europe, heathland, is, a, cultural, landscape, which, requires, grazing, by, cattle, sheep, or, other, grazers, to, be, maintained, an, author, of, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, report, livestock, s, long, shadow, stated, in, an, interview, grazing, occupies, 26, percent, of, earth, s, terrestrial, surface, feed, crop, production, requires, about, a, third, of, all, arable, land, expansion, of, grazing, land, for, livestock, is, also, a, leading, cause, of, deforestation, especially, in, latin, america, in, the, amazon, basin, alone, about, 70, percent, of, previously, forested, land, is, used, as, pasture, while, feed, crops, cover, a, large, part, of, the, remainder, much, grazing, land, has, resulted, from, a, process, of, clearance, or, drainage, of, other, habitats, such, as, woodland, or, wetland, according, to, the, opinion, of, the, center, for, biological, diversity, extensive, grazing, of, livestock, in, the, arid, lands, of, the, southwestern, united, states, has, many, negative, impacts, on, the, local, biodiversity, there, cattle, destroy, native, vegetation, damage, soils, and, stream, banks, and, contaminate, waterways, with, fecal, waste, after, decades, of, livestock, grazing, once, lush, streams, and, riparian, forests, have, been, reduced, to, flat, dry, wastelands, once, rich, topsoil, has, been, turned, to, dust, causing, soil, erosion, stream, sedimentation, and, wholesale, elimination, of, some, aquatic, habitats, in, arid, climates, such, as, the, southwestern, united, states, livestock, grazing, has, severely, degraded, riparian, areas, the, wetland, environment, adjacent, to, rivers, or, streams, the, environmental, protection, agency, states, that, agriculture, has, a, greater, impact, on, stream, and, river, contamination, than, any, other, nonpoint, source, improper, grazing, of, riparian, areas, can, contribute, to, nonpoint, source, pollution, of, riparian, areas, riparian, zones, in, arid, and, semiarid, environments, have, been, called, biodiversity, hotspots, the, water, higher, biomass, favorable, microclimate, and, periodic, flood, events, together, produce, higher, biological, diversity, than, in, the, surrounding, uplands, in, 1990, according, to, the, arizona, state, park, department, over, 90, of, the, original, riparian, zones, of, arizona, and, new, mexico, are, gone, a, 1988, report, of, the, government, accountability, office, estimated, that, 90, of, the, 5, 300, miles, of, riparian, habitat, managed, by, the, bureau, of, land, management, in, colorado, was, in, unsatisfactory, condition, as, was, 80, of, idaho, s, riparian, zones, concluding, that, poorly, managed, livestock, grazing, is, the, major, cause, of, degraded, riparian, habitat, on, federal, rangelands, a, 2013, fao, report, estimated, livestock, were, responsible, for, 14, 5, of, anthropogenic, greenhouse, gas, emissions, grazing, is, common, in, new, zealand, in, 2004, methane, and, nitrous, oxide, from, agriculture, made, up, somewhat, less, than, half, of, new, zealand, s, greenhouse, gas, emissions, of, which, most, is, attributable, to, livestock, a, 2008, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, report, on, emissions, found, agriculture, was, responsible, for, 6, of, total, united, states, greenhouse, gas, emissions, in, 2006, this, included, rice, production, enteric, fermentation, in, domestic, livestock, livestock, manure, management, and, agricultural, soil, management, but, omitted, some, things, which, might, be, attributable, to, agriculture, studies, comparing, the, methane, emissions, from, grazing, and, feedlot, cattle, concluded, that, grass, fed, cattle, produce, much, more, methane, than, grain, fed, cattle, one, study, in, the, journal, of, animal, science, found, four, times, as, much, and, stated, these, measurements, clearly, document, higher, ch, 4,
