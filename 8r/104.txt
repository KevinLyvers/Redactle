the, breasts, are, two, prominences, located, on, the, upper, ventral, region, of, the, torso, among, humans, and, other, primates, both, sexes, develop, breasts, from, the, same, embryological, tissues, the, relative, size, and, development, of, the, breasts, is, a, major, secondary, sex, distinction, between, females, and, males, there, is, also, considerable, variation, in, size, between, individuals, female, humans, are, the, only, mammals, which, permanently, develop, breasts, at, puberty, all, other, mammals, develop, their, mammary, tissue, during, the, latter, period, of, pregnancy, at, puberty, estrogens, in, conjunction, with, growth, hormone, cause, permanent, breast, growth, in, females, the, breast, serves, as, the, mammary, gland, which, produces, and, secretes, milk, to, feed, infants, subcutaneous, fat, covers, and, envelops, a, network, of, ducts, that, converge, on, the, nipple, and, these, tissues, give, the, breast, its, distinct, size, and, globular, shape, at, the, ends, of, the, ducts, are, lobules, or, clusters, of, alveoli, where, milk, is, produced, and, stored, in, response, to, hormonal, signals, during, pregnancy, the, breast, responds, to, a, complex, interaction, of, hormones, including, estrogens, progesterone, and, prolactin, that, mediate, the, completion, of, its, development, namely, lobuloalveolar, maturation, in, preparation, of, lactation, and, breastfeeding, along, with, their, major, function, in, providing, nutrition, for, infants, several, cultures, ascribe, social, and, sexual, characteristics, to, female, breasts, and, may, regard, bare, breasts, in, public, as, immodest, or, indecent, breasts, have, been, featured, in, ancient, and, modern, sculpture, art, and, photography, breasts, can, represent, fertility, femininity, or, abundance, they, can, figure, prominently, in, the, perception, of, a, woman, s, body, and, sexual, attractiveness, breasts, especially, the, nipples, can, be, an, erogenous, zone, the, english, word, breast, derives, from, the, old, english, word, br, ost, breast, bosom, from, proto, germanic, breustam, breast, from, the, proto, indo, european, base, bhreus, to, swell, to, sprout, the, breast, spelling, conforms, to, the, scottish, and, north, english, dialectal, pronunciations, the, merriam, webster, dictionary, states, that, middle, english, brest, from, old, english, br, ost, akin, to, old, high, german, brust, old, irish, br, russian, bryukho, the, first, known, usage, of, the, term, was, before, the, 12th, century, breasts, is, often, used, to, refer, to, female, breasts, in, particular, though, the, stricter, anatomical, term, refers, to, the, same, region, on, members, of, either, sex, male, breasts, are, sometimes, referred, to, in, the, singular, to, mean, the, collective, upper, chest, area, whereas, female, breasts, are, referred, to, in, the, plural, unless, speaking, of, a, specific, left, or, right, breast, a, large, number, of, colloquial, terms, for, female, breasts, are, used, in, english, ranging, from, fairly, polite, terms, to, vulgar, or, slang, some, vulgar, slang, expressions, may, be, considered, to, be, derogatory, or, sexist, to, women, humans, are, the, only, mammals, whose, breasts, become, permanently, enlarged, after, sexual, maturity, known, in, humans, as, puberty, the, reason, for, this, evolutionary, change, is, unknown, several, hypotheses, have, been, put, forward, a, link, has, been, proposed, to, processes, for, synthesizing, the, endogenous, steroid, hormone, precursor, dehydroepiandrosterone, which, takes, place, in, fat, rich, regions, of, the, body, like, the, buttocks, and, breasts, these, contributed, to, human, brain, development, and, played, a, part, in, increasing, brain, size, breast, enlargement, may, for, this, purpose, have, occurred, as, early, as, homo, ergaster, 1, 7, 1, 4, mya, other, breast, formation, hypotheses, may, have, then, taken, over, as, principal, drivers, it, has, been, suggested, by, zoologists, avishag, and, amotz, zahavi, that, the, size, of, the, human, breasts, can, be, explained, by, the, handicap, theory, of, sexual, dimorphism, this, would, see, the, explanation, for, larger, breasts, as, them, being, an, honest, display, of, the, women, s, health, and, ability, to, grow, and, carry, them, in, her, life, prospective, mates, can, then, evaluate, the, genes, of, a, potential, mate, for, their, ability, to, sustain, her, health, even, with, the, additional, energy, demanding, burden, she, is, carrying, the, zoologist, desmond, morris, describes, a, sociobiological, approach, in, his, science, book, the, naked, ape, he, suggests, by, making, comparisons, with, the, other, primates, that, breasts, evolved, to, replace, swelling, buttocks, as, a, sex, signal, of, ovulation, he, notes, how, humans, have, relatively, speaking, large, penises, as, well, as, large, breasts, furthermore, early, humans, adopted, bipedalism, and, face, to, face, coitus, he, therefore, suggested, enlarged, sexual, signals, helped, maintain, the, bond, between, a, mated, male, and, female, even, though, they, performed, different, duties, and, therefore, were, separated, for, lengths, of, time, a, 2001, study, proposed, that, the, rounded, shape, of, a, woman, s, breast, evolved, to, prevent, the, sucking, infant, offspring, from, suffocating, while, feeding, at, the, teat, that, is, because, of, the, human, infant, s, small, jaw, which, did, not, project, from, the, face, to, reach, the, nipple, they, might, block, the, nostrils, against, the, mother, s, breast, if, it, were, of, a, flatter, form, compare, with, the, common, chimpanzee, theoretically, as, the, human, jaw, receded, into, the, face, the, woman, s, body, compensated, with, round, breasts, ashley, montague, 1965, proposed, that, breasts, came, about, as, an, adaptation, for, infant, feeding, for, a, different, reason, as, early, human, ancestors, adopted, bipedalism, and, the, loss, of, body, hair, human, upright, stance, meant, infants, must, be, carried, at, the, hip, or, shoulder, instead, of, on, the, back, as, in, the, apes, this, gives, the, infant, less, opportunity, to, find, the, nipple, or, the, purchase, to, cling, on, to, the, mother, s, body, hair, the, mobility, of, the, nipple, on, a, large, breast, in, most, human, females, gives, the, infant, more, ability, to, find, it, grasp, it, and, feed, other, suggestions, include, simply, that, permanent, breasts, attracted, mates, that, pendulous, breasts, gave, infants, something, to, cling, to, or, that, permanent, breasts, shared, the, function, of, a, camel, s, hump, to, store, fat, as, an, energy, reserve, in, women, the, breasts, overlie, the, pectoralis, major, muscles, and, extend, on, average, from, the, level, of, the, second, rib, to, the, level, of, the, sixth, rib, in, the, front, of, the, rib, cage, thus, the, breasts, cover, much, of, the, chest, area, and, the, chest, walls, at, the, front, of, the, chest, the, breast, tissue, can, extend, from, the, clavicle, collarbone, to, the, middle, of, the, sternum, breastbone, at, the, sides, of, the, chest, the, breast, tissue, can, extend, into, the, axilla, armpit, and, can, reach, as, far, to, the, back, as, the, latissimus, dorsi, muscle, extending, from, the, lower, back, to, the, humerus, bone, the, bone, of, the, upper, arm, as, a, mammary, gland, the, breast, is, composed, of, differing, layers, of, tissue, predominantly, two, types, adipose, tissue, and, glandular, tissue, which, affects, the, lactation, functions, of, the, breasts, 115, the, natural, resonant, frequency, of, the, human, breast, is, about, 2, hertz, morphologically, the, breast, is, tear, shaped, the, superficial, tissue, layer, superficial, fascia, is, separated, from, the, skin, by, 0, 5, 2, 5, cm, of, subcutaneous, fat, adipose, tissue, the, suspensory, cooper, s, ligaments, are, fibrous, tissue, prolongations, that, radiate, from, the, superficial, fascia, to, the, skin, envelope, the, female, adult, breast, contains, 14, 18, irregular, lactiferous, lobes, that, converge, at, the, nipple, the, 2, 0, 4, 5, mm, milk, ducts, are, immediately, surrounded, with, dense, connective, tissue, that, support, the, glands, milk, exits, the, breast, through, the, nipple, which, is, surrounded, by, a, pigmented, area, of, skin, called, the, areola, the, size, of, the, areola, can, vary, widely, among, women, the, areola, contains, modified, sweat, glands, known, as, montgomery, s, glands, these, glands, secrete, oily, fluid, that, lubricate, and, protect, the, nipple, during, breastfeeding, volatile, compounds, in, these, secretions, may, also, serve, as, an, olfactory, stimulus, for, the, newborn, s, appetite, the, dimensions, and, weight, of, the, breast, vary, widely, among, women, a, small, to, medium, sized, breast, weighs, 500, grams, 1, 1, pounds, or, less, and, a, large, breast, can, weigh, approximately, 750, to, 1, 000, grams, 1, 7, to, 2, 2, pounds, or, more, in, terms, of, composition, the, breasts, are, about, 80, to, 90, stromal, tissue, fat, and, connective, tissue, while, epithelial, or, glandular, tissue, only, accounts, for, about, 10, to, 20, of, the, volume, of, the, breasts, the, tissue, composition, ratios, of, the, breast, also, vary, among, women, some, women, s, breasts, have, a, higher, proportion, of, glandular, tissue, than, of, adipose, or, connective, tissues, the, fat, to, connective, tissue, ratio, determines, the, density, or, firmness, of, the, breast, during, a, woman, s, life, her, breasts, change, size, shape, and, weight, due, to, hormonal, changes, during, puberty, the, menstrual, cycle, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and, menopause, the, breast, is, an, apocrine, gland, that, produces, the, milk, used, to, feed, an, infant, the, nipple, of, the, breast, is, surrounded, by, the, areola, nipple, areola, complex, the, areola, has, many, sebaceous, glands, and, the, skin, color, varies, from, pink, to, dark, brown, the, basic, units, of, the, breast, are, the, terminal, duct, lobular, units, tdlus, which, produce, the, fatty, breast, milk, they, give, the, breast, its, offspring, feeding, functions, as, a, mammary, gland, they, are, distributed, throughout, the, body, of, the, breast, approximately, two, thirds, of, the, lactiferous, tissue, is, within, 30, mm, of, the, base, of, the, nipple, the, terminal, lactiferous, ducts, drain, the, milk, from, tdlus, into, 4, 18, lactiferous, ducts, which, drain, to, the, nipple, the, milk, glands, to, fat, ratio, is, 2, 1, in, a, lactating, woman, and, 1, 1, in, a, non, lactating, woman, in, addition, to, the, milk, glands, the, breast, is, also, composed, of, connective, tissues, collagen, elastin, white, fat, and, the, suspensory, cooper, s, ligaments, sensation, in, the, breast, is, provided, by, the, peripheral, nervous, system, innervation, by, means, of, the, front, anterior, and, side, lateral, cutaneous, branches, of, the, fourth, fifth, and, sixth, intercostal, nerves, the, t, 4, nerve, thoracic, spinal, nerve, 4, which, innervates, the, dermatomic, area, supplies, sensation, to, the, nipple, areola, complex, approximately, 75, of, the, lymph, from, the, breast, travels, to, the, axillary, lymph, nodes, on, the, same, side, of, the, body, whilst, 25, of, the, lymph, travels, to, the, parasternal, nodes, beside, the, sternum, bone, 116, a, small, amount, of, remaining, lymph, travels, to, the, other, breast, and, to, the, abdominal, lymph, nodes, the, subareolar, region, has, a, lymphatic, plexus, known, as, the, subareolar, plexus, of, sappey, the, axillary, lymph, nodes, include, the, pectoral, chest, subscapular, under, the, scapula, and, humeral, humerus, bone, area, lymph, node, groups, which, drain, to, the, central, axillary, lymph, nodes, and, to, the, apical, axillary, lymph, nodes, the, lymphatic, drainage, of, the, breasts, is, especially, relevant, to, oncology, because, breast, cancer, is, common, to, the, mammary, gland, and, cancer, cells, can, metastasize, break, away, from, a, tumour, and, be, dispersed, to, other, parts, of, the, body, by, means, of, the, lymphatic, system, the, morphologic, variations, in, the, size, shape, volume, tissue, density, pectoral, locale, and, spacing, of, the, breasts, determine, their, natural, shape, appearance, and, position, on, a, woman, s, chest, breast, size, and, other, characteristics, do, not, predict, the, fat, to, milk, gland, ratio, or, the, potential, for, the, woman, to, nurse, an, infant, the, size, and, the, shape, of, the, breasts, are, influenced, by, normal, life, hormonal, changes, thelarche, menstruation, pregnancy, menopause, and, medical, conditions, e, g, virginal, breast, hypertrophy, the, shape, of, the, breasts, is, naturally, determined, by, the, support, of, the, suspensory, cooper, s, ligaments, the, underlying, muscle, and, bone, structures, of, the, chest, and, by, the, skin, envelope, the, suspensory, ligaments, sustain, the, breast, from, the, clavicle, collarbone, and, the, clavico, pectoral, fascia, collarbone, and, chest, by, traversing, and, encompassing, the, fat, and, milk, gland, tissues, the, breast, is, positioned, affixed, to, and, supported, upon, the, chest, wall, while, its, shape, is, established, and, maintained, by, the, skin, envelope, in, most, women, one, breast, is, slightly, larger, than, the, other, more, obvious, and, persistent, asymmetry, in, breast, size, occurs, in, up, to, 25, of, women, while, it, is, a, common, belief, that, breastfeeding, causes, breasts, to, sag, researchers, have, found, that, a, woman, s, breasts, sag, due, to, four, key, factors, cigarette, smoking, number, of, pregnancies, gravity, and, weight, loss, or, gain, women, sometimes, wear, bras, because, they, mistakenly, believe, they, prevent, breasts, from, sagging, as, they, get, older, physicians, lingerie, retailers, teenagers, and, adult, women, used, to, believe, that, bras, were, medically, required, to, support, breasts, in, a, 1952, article, in, parents, magazine, frank, h, crowell, erroneously, reported, that, it, was, important, for, teen, girls, to, begin, wearing, bras, early, according, to, crowell, this, would, prevent, sagging, breasts, stretched, blood, vessels, and, poor, circulation, later, on, this, belief, was, based, on, the, false, idea, that, breasts, cannot, anatomically, support, themselves, the, base, of, each, breast, is, attached, to, the, chest, by, the, deep, fascia, over, the, pectoralis, major, muscles, the, space, between, the, breast, and, the, pectoralis, major, muscle, called, retromammary, space, gives, mobility, to, the, breast, the, chest, thoracic, cavity, progressively, slopes, outwards, from, the, thoracic, inlet, atop, the, breastbone, and, above, to, the, lowest, ribs, that, support, the, breasts, the, inframammary, fold, where, the, lower, portion, of, the, breast, meets, the, chest, is, an, anatomic, feature, created, by, the, adherence, of, the, breast, skin, and, the, underlying, connective, tissues, of, the, chest, the, imf, is, the, lower, most, extent, of, the, anatomic, breast, normal, breast, tissue, typically, has, a, texture, that, feels, nodular, or, granular, to, an, extent, that, varies, considerably, from, woman, to, woman, the, breasts, are, principally, composed, of, adipose, glandular, and, connective, tissues, because, these, tissues, have, hormone, receptors, their, sizes, and, volumes, fluctuate, according, to, the, hormonal, changes, particular, to, thelarche, sprouting, of, breasts, menstruation, egg, production, pregnancy, reproduction, lactation, feeding, of, offspring, and, menopause, end, of, menstruation, the, morphological, structure, of, the, human, breast, is, identical, in, males, and, females, until, puberty, for, pubescent, girls, in, thelarche, the, breast, development, stage, the, female, sex, hormones, principally, estrogens, in, conjunction, with, growth, hormone, promote, the, sprouting, growth, and, development, of, the, breasts, during, this, time, the, mammary, glands, grow, in, size, and, volume, and, begin, resting, on, the, chest, these, development, stages, of, secondary, sex, characteristics, breasts, pubic, hair, etc, are, illustrated, in, the, five, stage, tanner, scale, during, thelarche, the, developing, breasts, are, sometimes, of, unequal, size, and, usually, the, left, breast, is, slightly, larger, this, condition, of, asymmetry, is, transitory, and, statistically, normal, in, female, physical, and, sexual, development, medical, conditions, can, cause, overdevelopment, e, g, virginal, breast, hypertrophy, macromastia, or, underdevelopment, e, g, tuberous, breast, deformity, micromastia, in, girls, and, women, approximately, two, years, after, the, onset, of, puberty, a, girl, s, first, menstrual, cycle, estrogen, and, growth, hormone, stimulate, the, development, and, growth, of, the, glandular, fat, and, suspensory, tissues, that, compose, the, breast, this, continues, for, approximately, four, years, until, the, final, shape, of, the, breast, size, volume, density, is, established, at, about, the, age, of, 21, mammoplasia, breast, enlargement, in, girls, begins, at, puberty, unlike, all, other, primates, in, which, breasts, enlarge, only, during, lactation, during, the, menstrual, cycle, the, breasts, are, enlarged, by, premenstrual, water, retention, and, temporary, growth, the, breasts, reach, full, maturity, only, when, a, woman, s, first, pregnancy, occurs, changes, to, the, breasts, are, among, the, first, signs, of, pregnancy, the, breasts, become, larger, the, nipple, areola, complex, becomes, larger, and, darker, the, montgomery, s, glands, enlarge, and, veins, sometimes, become, more, visible, breast, tenderness, during, pregnancy, is, common, especially, during, the, first, trimester, by, mid, pregnancy, the, breast, is, physiologically, capable, of, lactation, and, some, women, can, express, colostrum, a, form, of, breast, milk, pregnancy, causes, elevated, levels, of, the, hormone, prolactin, which, has, a, key, role, in, the, production, of, milk, however, milk, production, is, blocked, by, the, hormones, progesterone, and, estrogen, until, after, delivery, when, progesterone, and, estrogen, levels, plummet, at, menopause, breast, atrophy, occurs, the, breasts, can, decrease, in, size, when, the, levels, of, circulating, estrogen, decline, the, adipose, tissue, and, milk, glands, also, begin, to, wither, the, breasts, can, also, become, enlarged, from, adverse, side, effects, of, combined, oral, contraceptive, pills, the, size, of, the, breasts, can, also, increase, and, decrease, in, response, to, weight, fluctuations, physical, changes, to, the, breasts, are, often, recorded, in, the, stretch, marks, of, the, skin, envelope, they, can, serve, as, historical, indicators, of, the, increments, and, the, decrements, of, the, size, and, volume, of, a, woman, s, breasts, throughout, the, course, of, her, life, breast, cancer, is, a, cancer, that, develops, from, breast, tissue, signs, of, breast, cancer, may, include, a, lump, in, the, breast, a, change, in, breast, shape, dimpling, of, the, skin, milk, rejection, fluid, coming, from, the, nipple, a, newly, inverted, nipple, or, a, red, or, scaly, patch, of, skin, in, those, with, distant, spread, of, the, disease, there, may, be, bone, pain, swollen, lymph, nodes, shortness, of, breath, or, yellow, skin, risk, factors, for, developing, breast, cancer, include, obesity, a, lack, of, physical, exercise, alcohol, consumption, hormone, replacement, therapy, during, menopause, ionizing, radiation, an, early, age, at, first, menstruation, having, children, late, in, life, or, not, at, all, older, age, having, a, prior, history, of, breast, cancer, and, a, family, history, of, breast, cancer, about, five, to, ten, percent, of, cases, are, the, result, of, an, inherited, genetic, predisposition, including, brca, mutations, among, others, breast, cancer, most, commonly, develops, in, cells, from, the, lining, of, milk, ducts, and, the, lobules, that, supply, these, ducts, with, milk, cancers, developing, from, the, ducts, are, known, as, ductal, carcinomas, while, those, developing, from, lobules, are, known, as, lobular, carcinomas, there, are, more, than, 18, other, sub, types, of, breast, cancer, some, such, as, ductal, carcinoma, in, situ, develop, from, pre, invasive, lesions, the, diagnosis, of, breast, cancer, is, confirmed, by, taking, a, biopsy, of, the, concerning, tissue, once, the, diagnosis, is, made, further, tests, are, carried, out, to, determine, if, the, cancer, has, spread, beyond, the, breast, and, which, treatments, are, most, likely, to, be, effective, the, primary, function, of, the, breasts, as, mammary, glands, is, the, nourishing, of, an, infant, with, breast, milk, milk, is, produced, in, milk, secreting, cells, in, the, alveoli, when, the, breasts, are, stimulated, by, the, suckling, of, her, baby, the, mother, s, brain, secretes, oxytocin, high, levels, of, oxytocin, trigger, the, contraction, of, muscle, cells, surrounding, the, alveoli, causing, milk, to, flow, along, the, ducts, that, connect, the, alveoli, to, the, nipple, full, term, newborns, have, an, instinct, and, a, need, to, suck, on, a, nipple, and, breastfed, babies, nurse, for, both, nutrition, and, for, comfort, breast, milk, provides, all, necessary, nutrients, for, the, first, six, months, of, life, and, then, remains, an, important, source, of, nutrition, alongside, solid, foods, until, at, least, one, or, two, years, of, age, biomechanical, studies, have, demonstrated, that, depending, on, the, activity, and, the, size, of, a, woman, s, breast, when, she, walks, or, runs, braless, her, breasts, may, move, up, and, down, by, 4, to, 18, centimetres, 1, 6, to, 7, 1, in, or, more, and, also, oscillate, side, to, side, researchers, have, also, found, that, as, women, s, breast, size, increased, they, took, part, in, less, physical, activity, especially, vigorous, exercise, few, very, large, breasted, women, jogged, for, example, to, avoid, exercise, related, discomfort, and, pain, medical, experts, suggest, women, wear, a, well, fitted, sports, bra, during, activity, the, breast, is, susceptible, to, numerous, benign, and, malignant, conditions, the, most, frequent, benign, conditions, are, puerperal, mastitis, fibrocystic, breast, changes, and, mastalgia, lactation, unrelated, to, pregnancy, is, known, as, galactorrhea, it, can, be, caused, by, certain, drugs, such, as, antipsychotic, medications, extreme, physical, stress, or, endocrine, disorders, lactation, in, newborns, is, caused, by, hormones, from, the, mother, that, crossed, into, the, baby, s, bloodstream, during, pregnancy, breast, cancer, is, the, most, common, cause, of, cancer, death, among, women, and, it, is, one, of, the, leading, causes, of, death, among, women, factors, that, appear, to, be, implicated, in, decreasing, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, are, regular, breast, examinations, by, health, care, professionals, regular, mammograms, self, examination, of, breasts, healthy, diet, exercise, to, decrease, excess, body, fat, and, breastfeeding, both, females, and, males, develop, breasts, from, the, same, embryological, tissues, anatomically, male, breasts, do, not, normally, contain, lobules, and, acini, that, are, present, in, females, in, rare, instances, it, is, possible, for, very, few, lobules, to, be, present, this, makes, it, possible, for, some, men, to, develop, lobular, carcinoma, of, the, breast, normally, males, produce, lower, levels, of, estrogens, and, higher, levels, of, androgens, namely, testosterone, which, suppress, the, effects, of, estrogens, in, developing, excessive, breast, tissue, in, boys, and, men, abnormal, breast, development, is, manifested, as, gynecomastia, the, consequence, of, a, biochemical, imbalance, between, the, normal, levels, of, estrogen, and, testosterone, in, the, male, body, around, 70, of, boys, temporarily, develop, breast, tissue, during, adolescence, the, condition, usually, resolves, by, itself, within, two, years, when, male, lactation, occurs, it, is, considered, a, symptom, of, a, disorder, of, the, pituitary, gland, plastic, surgery, can, be, performed, to, augment, or, reduce, the, size, of, breasts, or, reconstruct, the, breast, in, cases, of, deformative, disease, such, as, breast, cancer, breast, augmentation, and, breast, lift, mastopexy, procedures, are, done, only, for, cosmetic, reasons, whereas, breast, reduction, is, sometimes, medically, indicated, in, cases, where, a, woman, s, breasts, are, severely, asymmetrical, surgery, can, be, performed, to, either, enlarge, the, smaller, breast, reduce, the, size, of, the, larger, breast, or, both, breast, augmentation, surgery, generally, does, not, interfere, with, future, ability, to, breastfeed, breast, reduction, surgery, more, frequently, leads, to, decreased, sensation, in, the, nipple, areola, complex, and, to, low, milk, supply, in, women, who, choose, to, breastfeed, implants, can, interfere, with, mammography, breast, x, rays, images, in, christian, iconography, some, works, of, art, depict, women, with, their, breasts, in, their, hands, or, on, a, platter, signifying, that, they, died, as, a, martyr, by, having, their, breasts, severed, one, example, of, this, is, saint, agatha, of, sicily, femen, is, a, feminist, activist, group, which, uses, topless, protests, as, part, of, their, campaigns, against, sex, tourism, religious, institutions, sexism, and, homophobia, femen, activists, have, been, regularly, detained, by, police, in, response, to, their, protests, there, is, a, long, history, of, female, breasts, being, used, by, comedians, as, a, subject, for, comedy, fodder, e, g, british, comic, benny, hill, s, burlesque, slapstick, routines, in, european, pre, historic, societies, sculptures, of, female, figures, with, pronounced, or, highly, exaggerated, breasts, were, common, a, typical, example, is, the, so, called, venus, of, willendorf, one, of, many, paleolithic, venus, figurines, with, ample, hips, and, bosom, artifacts, such, as, bowls, rock, carvings, and, sacred, statues, with,
