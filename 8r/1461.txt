a, phobia, is, an, anxiety, disorder, defined, by, an, irrational, unrealistic, persistent, and, excessive, fear, of, an, object, or, situation, phobias, typically, result, in, a, rapid, onset, of, fear, and, are, usually, present, for, more, than, six, months, those, affected, go, to, great, lengths, to, avoid, the, situation, or, object, to, a, degree, greater, than, the, actual, danger, posed, if, the, object, or, situation, cannot, be, avoided, they, experience, significant, distress, other, symptoms, can, include, fainting, which, may, occur, in, blood, or, injury, phobia, and, panic, attacks, often, found, in, agoraphobia, and, emetophobia, around, 75, of, those, with, phobias, have, multiple, phobias, phobias, can, be, divided, into, specific, phobias, social, anxiety, disorder, and, agoraphobia, specific, phobias, are, further, divided, to, include, certain, animals, natural, environment, blood, or, injury, and, particular, situations, the, most, common, are, fear, of, spiders, fear, of, snakes, and, fear, of, heights, specific, phobias, may, be, caused, by, a, negative, experience, with, the, object, or, situation, in, early, childhood, social, phobia, is, when, a, person, fears, a, situation, due, to, worries, about, others, judging, them, agoraphobia, is, a, fear, of, a, situation, due, to, perceived, difficulty, or, inability, to, escape, it, is, recommended, that, specific, phobias, be, treated, with, exposure, therapy, in, which, the, person, is, introduced, to, the, situation, or, object, in, question, until, the, fear, resolves, medications, are, not, helpful, for, specific, phobias, social, phobia, and, agoraphobia, may, be, treated, with, counseling, medications, or, a, combination, of, both, medications, used, include, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or, beta, blockers, specific, phobias, affect, about, 6, 8, of, people, in, the, western, world, and, 2, 4, in, asia, africa, and, latin, america, in, a, given, year, social, phobia, affects, about, 7, of, people, in, the, united, states, and, 0, 5, 2, 5, of, people, in, the, rest, of, the, world, agoraphobia, affects, about, 1, 7, of, people, women, are, affected, by, phobias, about, twice, as, often, as, men, the, typical, onset, of, a, phobia, is, around, 10, 17, and, rates, are, lower, with, increasing, age, those, with, phobias, are, more, likely, to, attempt, suicide, fear, is, an, emotional, response, to, a, current, perceived, danger, this, differs, from, anxiety, which, is, a, response, in, preparation, of, a, future, threat, fear, and, anxiety, often, can, overlap, but, this, distinction, can, help, identify, subtle, differences, between, disorders, as, well, as, differentiate, between, a, response, that, would, be, expected, given, a, person, s, developmental, stage, and, culture, the, international, classification, of, diseases, 11th, version, icd, 11, is, a, globally, used, diagnostic, tool, for, epidemiology, health, management, and, clinical, purposes, maintained, by, the, world, health, organization, who, the, icd, classifies, phobic, disorders, under, the, category, of, mental, behavioural, or, neurodevelopmental, disorders, the, icd, 10, differentiates, between, phobic, anxiety, disorders, such, as, agoraphobia, and, other, anxiety, disorders, such, as, generalized, anxiety, disorder, the, icd, 11, merges, both, groups, together, as, anxiety, or, fear, related, disorders, most, phobias, are, classified, into, 3, categories, according, to, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, fifth, edition, dsm, 5, such, phobias, are, considered, subtypes, of, anxiety, disorder, the, categories, are, phobias, vary, in, severity, among, individuals, some, individuals, can, avoid, the, subject, and, experience, relatively, mild, anxiety, over, that, fear, others, experience, full, fledged, panic, attacks, with, all, the, associated, impairing, symptoms, most, individuals, understand, that, their, fear, is, irrational, but, cannot, override, their, panic, response, these, individuals, often, report, dizziness, loss, of, bladder, or, bowel, control, tachypnea, feelings, of, pain, and, shortness, of, breath, phobias, may, develop, for, a, variety, of, reasons, childhood, experiences, past, traumatic, experiences, brain, chemistry, genetics, or, learned, behavior, can, all, be, reasons, why, phobias, develop, there, are, even, phobias, that, may, run, in, families, and, be, passed, down, from, one, generation, to, another, there, are, multiple, theories, about, how, phobias, develop, and, likely, occur, due, to, a, combination, of, environmental, and, genetic, factors, the, degree, to, whether, environment, or, genetic, influences, have, a, more, significant, role, varies, by, condition, with, social, anxiety, disorder, and, agoraphobia, having, around, a, 50, heritability, rate, rachman, proposed, three, pathways, for, the, development, of, phobias, direct, or, classical, conditioning, exposure, to, phobic, stimulus, vicarious, acquisition, seeing, others, experience, phobic, stimulus, and, informational, instructional, acquisition, learning, about, phobic, stimulus, from, others, much, of, the, progress, in, understanding, the, acquisition, of, fear, responses, in, phobias, can, be, attributed, to, classical, conditioning, pavlovian, model, when, an, aversive, stimulus, and, a, neutral, one, are, paired, together, for, instance, when, an, electric, shock, is, given, in, a, specific, room, the, subject, can, start, to, fear, not, only, the, shock, but, the, room, as, well, in, behavioral, terms, the, room, is, a, conditioned, stimulus, cs, when, paired, with, an, aversive, unconditioned, stimulus, ucs, the, shock, it, creates, a, conditioned, response, cr, fear, for, the, room, cs, ucs, cr, for, example, in, case, of, the, fear, of, heights, acrophobia, the, cs, is, heights, such, as, a, balcony, on, the, top, floors, of, a, high, rise, building, the, ucs, can, originate, from, an, aversive, or, traumatizing, event, in, the, person, s, life, such, as, almost, falling, from, a, great, height, the, original, fear, of, nearly, falling, is, associated, with, being, high, leading, to, a, fear, of, heights, in, other, words, the, cs, heights, associated, with, the, aversive, ucs, almost, falling, leads, to, the, cr, fear, the, conditioned, response, cr, however, can, also, be, removed, or, extinguished, it, is, quite, fascinating, that, we, can, reverse, the, effects, of, the, conditioned, stimulus, cs, and, unconditioned, stimulus, ucs, repeatedly, presenting, the, conditioned, stimulus, alone, that, is, without, the, unconditioned, stimulus, ucs, can, extinguish, the, conditioned, response, cr, though, historically, influential, in, the, theory, of, fear, acquisition, this, direct, conditioning, model, is, not, the, only, proposed, way, to, acquire, a, phobia, this, theory, in, fact, has, limitations, as, not, everyone, that, has, experienced, a, traumatic, event, develops, a, phobia, and, vice, versa, vicarious, fear, acquisition, is, learning, to, fear, something, not, by, a, subject, s, own, experience, of, fear, but, by, watching, others, oftentimes, a, parent, observational, learning, for, instance, when, a, child, sees, a, parent, reacting, fearfully, to, an, animal, the, child, can, also, become, afraid, of, the, animal, through, observational, learning, humans, can, learn, to, fear, potentially, dangerous, objects, a, reaction, observed, in, other, primates, a, study, on, non, human, primates, showed, that, the, primates, learned, to, fear, snakes, at, a, fast, rate, after, watching, parents, fearful, reactions, an, increase, in, fearful, behaviours, was, observed, as, the, non, human, primates, observed, their, parents, fearful, reactions, although, observational, learning, has, proven, effective, in, creating, reactions, of, fear, and, phobias, it, has, also, been, shown, that, by, physically, experiencing, an, event, increases, the, chance, of, fearful, and, phobic, behaviours, in, some, cases, physically, experiencing, an, event, may, increase, the, fear, and, phobia, more, than, observing, a, fearful, reaction, of, another, human, or, non, human, primate, informational, instructional, fear, acquisition, is, learning, to, fear, something, by, getting, information, for, instance, fearing, electrical, wire, after, hearing, that, touching, it, causes, an, electric, shock, a, conditioned, fear, response, to, an, object, or, situation, is, not, always, a, phobia, there, must, also, be, symptoms, of, impairment, and, avoidance, impairment, is, defined, as, an, inability, to, complete, routine, tasks, whether, occupational, academic, or, social, for, example, an, occupational, impairment, can, result, from, acrophobia, from, not, taking, a, job, solely, because, of, its, location, on, the, top, floor, of, a, building, or, socially, not, participating, in, an, event, at, a, theme, park, the, avoidance, aspect, is, defined, as, behaviour, that, results, in, the, omission, of, an, aversive, event, that, would, otherwise, occur, intending, to, prevent, anxiety, with, the, completion, of, the, human, genome, project, in, 2003, much, research, has, been, completed, looking, at, specific, genes, that, may, cause, or, contribute, to, medical, conditions, candidate, genes, were, the, focus, of, most, of, these, studies, until, the, past, decade, when, the, cost, and, ability, to, perform, genome, wide, analyses, became, more, available, the, glrb, gene, was, identified, as, a, possible, target, for, agoraphobia, an, area, still, in, development, is, reviewing, epigenetic, components, or, the, interaction, of, the, environment, on, genes, through, methylation, a, number, of, genes, are, being, examined, through, this, epigenetic, lens, which, may, be, linked, with, social, anxiety, disorder, including, maoa, crhr1, and, oxtr, each, phobia, related, disorder, has, some, degree, of, genetic, susceptibility, those, with, specific, phobias, are, more, likely, to, have, first, degree, relatives, with, the, same, specific, phobia, similarly, social, anxiety, disorder, is, found, two, to, six, times, more, frequently, in, those, with, first, degree, relatives, that, have, it, versus, those, that, do, not, agoraphobia, is, believed, to, have, the, strongest, genetic, association, beneath, the, lateral, fissure, in, the, cerebral, cortex, the, insula, or, insular, cortex, of, the, brain, has, been, identified, as, part, of, the, limbic, system, along, with, the, cingulated, gyrus, hippocampus, corpus, callosum, and, other, nearby, cortices, this, system, has, been, found, to, play, a, role, in, emotion, processing, and, the, insula, in, particular, may, contribute, to, maintaining, autonomic, functions, studies, by, critchley, et, al, indicate, the, insula, as, being, involved, in, the, experience, of, emotion, by, detecting, and, interpreting, threatening, stimuli, similar, studies, monitoring, insula, activity, have, shown, a, correlation, between, increased, insular, activation, and, anxiety, in, the, frontal, lobes, other, cortices, involved, with, phobia, and, fear, are, the, anterior, cingulate, cortex, and, the, medial, prefrontal, cortex, in, the, processing, of, emotional, stimuli, studies, on, phobic, reactions, to, facial, expressions, have, indicated, that, these, areas, are, involved, in, the, processing, and, responding, to, negative, stimuli, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, has, been, said, to, influence, the, amygdala, by, monitoring, its, reaction, to, emotional, stimuli, or, even, fearful, memories, most, specifically, the, medial, prefrontal, cortex, is, active, during, the, extinction, of, fear, and, is, responsible, for, long, term, extinction, stimulation, of, this, area, decreases, conditioned, fear, responses, so, its, role, may, be, in, inhibiting, the, amygdala, and, its, reaction, to, fearful, stimuli, the, hippocampus, is, a, horseshoe, shaped, structure, that, plays, an, essential, part, in, the, brain, s, limbic, system, this, is, because, it, forms, memories, and, connects, them, with, emotions, and, the, senses, when, dealing, with, fear, the, hippocampus, receives, impulses, from, the, amygdala, that, allow, it, to, connect, the, fear, with, a, certain, sense, such, as, a, smell, or, sound, the, amygdala, is, an, almond, shaped, mass, of, nuclei, located, deep, in, the, brain, s, medial, temporal, lobe, it, processes, the, events, associated, with, fear, and, is, linked, to, social, phobia, and, other, anxiety, disorders, the, amygdala, s, ability, to, respond, to, fearful, stimuli, occurs, through, fear, conditioning, like, classical, conditioning, the, amygdala, learns, to, associate, a, conditioned, stimulus, with, a, negative, or, avoidant, stimulus, creating, a, conditioned, fear, response, often, seen, in, phobic, individuals, the, amygdala, is, responsible, for, recognizing, certain, stimuli, or, cues, as, dangerous, and, plays, a, role, in, the, storage, of, threatening, stimuli, to, memory, the, basolateral, nuclei, or, basolateral, amygdala, and, the, hippocampus, interact, with, the, amygdala, in, memory, storage, this, connection, suggests, why, memories, are, often, remembered, more, vividly, if, they, have, emotional, significance, in, addition, to, memory, the, amygdala, also, triggers, the, secretion, of, hormones, that, affect, fear, and, aggression, when, the, fear, or, aggression, response, is, initiated, the, amygdala, releases, hormones, into, the, body, to, put, the, human, body, into, an, alert, state, which, prepares, the, individual, to, move, run, fight, etc, this, defensive, alert, state, and, response, are, known, as, the, fight, or, flight, response, however, inside, the, brain, this, stress, response, can, be, observed, in, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, hpa, this, circuit, incorporates, the, process, of, receiving, stimuli, interpreting, them, and, releasing, certain, hormones, into, the, bloodstream, the, parvocellular, neurosecretory, neurons, of, the, hypothalamus, release, corticotropin, releasing, hormone, crh, which, is, sent, to, the, anterior, pituitary, here, the, pituitary, releases, adrenocorticotropic, hormone, acth, which, ultimately, stimulates, the, release, of, cortisol, in, relation, to, anxiety, the, amygdala, activates, this, circuit, while, the, hippocampus, is, responsible, for, suppressing, it, glucocorticoid, receptors, in, the, hippocampus, monitor, the, amount, of, cortisol, in, the, system, and, through, negative, feedback, can, tell, the, hypothalamus, to, stop, releasing, crh, studies, on, mice, engineered, to, have, high, concentrations, of, crh, showed, higher, levels, of, anxiety, while, those, engineered, to, have, no, or, low, amounts, of, crh, receptors, were, less, anxious, in, people, with, phobias, therefore, high, amounts, of, cortisol, may, be, present, or, there, may, be, low, levels, of, glucocorticoid, receptors, or, even, serotonin, 5, ht, for, the, areas, in, the, brain, involved, in, emotion, most, specifically, fear, the, processing, and, response, to, emotional, stimuli, can, be, altered, when, one, of, these, regions, is, damaged, damage, to, the, cortical, areas, involved, in, the, limbic, system, such, as, the, cingulate, cortex, or, frontal, lobes, has, resulted, in, extreme, emotion, changes, other, types, of, damage, include, kl, ver, bucy, syndrome, and, urbach, wiethe, disease, in, kl, ver, bucy, syndrome, a, temporal, lobectomy, or, removal, of, the, temporal, lobes, results, in, changes, involving, fear, and, aggression, specifically, the, removal, of, these, lobes, results, in, decreased, fear, confirming, its, role, in, fear, recognition, and, response, damage, to, both, side, bilateral, damage, of, the, medial, temporal, lobes, is, known, as, urbach, wiethe, disease, it, presents, with, similar, symptoms, of, decreased, fear, and, aggression, but, with, the, addition, of, the, inability, to, recognize, emotional, expressions, especially, angry, or, fearful, faces, the, amygdala, s, role, in, learned, fear, includes, interactions, with, other, brain, regions, in, the, neural, circuit, of, fear, while, damage, in, the, amygdala, can, inhibit, its, ability, to, recognize, fearful, stimuli, other, areas, such, as, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, and, the, basolateral, nuclei, of, the, amygdala, can, affect, the, region, s, ability, to, not, only, become, conditioned, to, fearful, stimuli, but, to, extinguish, them, eventually, through, receiving, stimulus, info, the, basolateral, nuclei, undergo, synaptic, changes, that, allow, the, amygdala, to, develop, a, conditioned, response, to, fearful, stimuli, damage, to, this, area, therefore, have, been, shown, to, disrupt, the, acquisition, of, learned, responses, to, fear, likewise, damage, in, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, the, area, responsible, for, monitoring, the, amygdala, has, been, shown, to, slow, down, the, speed, of, extinguishing, a, learned, fear, response, and, how, effective, the, extinction, is, this, suggests, there, is, a, pathway, or, circuit, among, the, amygdala, and, nearby, cortical, areas, that, process, emotional, stimuli, and, influence, emotional, expression, all, of, which, can, be, disrupted, when, damage, occurs, it, is, recommended, that, the, terms, distress, and, impairment, take, into, account, the, context, of, the, person, s, environment, during, diagnosis, the, dsm, iv, tr, states, that, if, a, feared, stimulus, whether, it, be, an, object, or, a, situation, is, absent, entirely, in, an, environment, a, diagnosis, cannot, be, made, an, example, of, this, situation, would, be, an, individual, who, has, a, fear, of, mice, but, lives, in, an, area, without, mice, even, though, the, concept, of, mice, causes, marked, distress, and, impairment, within, the, individual, because, the, individual, does, not, usually, encounter, mice, no, actual, distress, or, impairment, is, ever, experienced, it, is, recommended, that, proximity, to, and, ability, to, escape, from, the, stimulus, also, be, considered, as, the, phobic, person, approaches, a, feared, stimulus, anxiety, levels, increase, and, the, degree, to, which, the, person, perceives, they, might, escape, from, the, stimulus, affects, the, intensity, of, fear, in, instances, such, as, riding, an, elevator, e, g, anxiety, increases, at, the, midway, point, between, floors, and, decreases, when, the, floor, is, reached, and, the, doors, open, the, dsm, v, has, been, updated, to, reflect, that, an, individual, may, have, changed, their, daily, activities, around, the, feared, stimulus, in, such, a, way, that, they, may, avoid, it, altogether, the, person, may, still, meet, criteria, for, the, diagnosis, if, they, continue, to, avoid, or, refuse, to, participate, in, activities, they, would, involve, possible, exposure, to, the, phobic, stimulus, a, specific, phobia, is, a, marked, and, persistent, fear, of, an, object, or, situation, specific, phobias, may, also, include, fear, of, losing, control, panicking, and, fainting, from, an, encounter, with, the, phobia, specific, phobias, are, defined, concerning, objects, or, situations, whereas, social, phobias, emphasize, social, fear, and, the, evaluations, that, might, accompany, them, the, dsm, breaks, specific, phobias, into, five, subtypes, animal, natural, environment, blood, injection, injury, situational, and, other, in, children, blood, injection, injury, phobia, animal, phobias, and, natural, environment, phobias, usually, develop, between, the, ages, of, 7, and, 9, reflective, of, normal, development, additionally, specific, phobias, are, most, prevalent, in, children, between, the, ages, 10, and, 13, situational, phobias, are, typically, found, in, older, children, and, adults, there, are, various, methods, used, to, treat, phobias, these, methods, include, systematic, desensitization, progressive, relaxation, virtual, reality, modeling, medication, and, hypnotherapy, over, the, past, several, decades, psychologists, and, other, researchers, have, developed, effective, behavioral, pharmacological, and, technological, interventions, for, the, treatment, of, phobia, virtual, reality, treatments, produce, similar, effects, to, in, vivo, exposure, another, efficacious, therapy, great, for, treating, phobias, although, virtual, reality, is, great, for, treating, phobias, the, treatment, will, not, work, for, every, phobia, the, treatment, has, positive, effects, but, depending, on, the, phobia, in, vivo, would, be, another, ideal, treatment, to, use, over, virtual, reality, in, vivo, exposure, is, a, great, way, to, reduce, fear, over, time, and, is, actually, more, preferred, when, trying, to, treat, anxiety, and, fear, related, problems, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, is, an, evidence, based, treatment, that, can, help, with, phobias, it, is, a, talk, therapy, that, can, be, used, alone, or, along, with, other, therapies, cbt, is, there, to, help, manage, stressful, situations, and, respond, better, this, therapy, requires, the, person, to, be, honest, with, themselves, and, confront, their, feelings, and, phobias, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, can, be, beneficial, by, allowing, the, person, to, challenge, dysfunctional, thoughts, or, beliefs, by, being, mindful, of, their, feelings, to, recognize, that, their, fear, is, irrational, cbt, may, occur, in, a, group, setting, gradual, desensitization, treatment, and, cbt, are, often, successful, provided, the, person, is, willing, to, endure, some, discomfort, in, one, clinical, trial, 90, of, people, no, longer, had, a, phobic, reaction, after, successful, cbt, treatment, research, in, the, uk, has, suggested, that, for, childhood, phobias, a, single, session, of, cbt, can, be, effective, evidence, supports, that, eye, movement, desensitization, and, reprocessing, emdr, is, effective, in, treating, some, phobias, its, effectiveness, in, treating, complex, or, trauma, related, phobias, has, not, been, empirically, established, primarily, used, to, treat, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, emdr, has, been, demonstrated, to, ease, phobia, symptoms, following, a, specific, trauma, such, as, a, fear, of, dogs, following, a, dog, bite, systematic, desensitization, is, a, process, in, which, people, seeking, help, slowly, become, accustomed, to, their, phobia, and, ultimately, overcome, it, traditional, systematic, desensitization, involves, a, person, being, exposed, to, the, object, they, are, afraid, of, over, time, so, that, the, fear, and, discomfort, do, not, become, overwhelming, this, controlled, exposure, to, the, anxiety, provoking, stimulus, is, key, to, the, effectiveness, of, exposure, therapy, in, the, treatment, of, specific, phobias, it, has, been, shown, that, humor, is, an, excellent, alternative, when, traditional, systematic, desensitization, is, ineffective, humor, systematic, desensitization, involves, a, series, of, treatment, activities, that, elicit, humor, with, the, feared, object, previously, learned, progressive, muscle, relaxation, procedures, can, be, used, as, the, activities, become, more, difficult, progressive, muscle, relaxation, helps, people, relax, before, and, during, exposure, to, the, feared, stimulus, virtual, reality, therapy, is, another, technique, that, helps, phobic, people, confront, a, feared, object, it, uses, virtual, reality, to, generate, scenes, that, may, not, have, been, possible, or, ethical, in, the, physical, world, it, is, equally, as, effective, as, traditional, exposure, therapy, and, offers, additional, advantages, these, include, controlling, the, scenes, and, having, the, phobic, person, endure, more, exposure, than, they, might, handle, in, reality, medications, are, a, treatment, option, often, utilized, in, combination, with, cbt, or, if, cbt, was, not, tolerated, or, effective, medications, can, help, regulate, apprehension, and, fear, of, a, particular, fearful, object, or, situation, there, are, various, medication, options, available, for, both, social, anxiety, disorder, and, agoraphobia, the, use, of, medications, for, specific, phobias, besides, the, limited, role, of, benzodiazepines, do, not, currently, have, established, guidelines, due, to, minimal, supporting, evidence, antidepressant, medications, such, as, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitors, ssris, serotonin, norepinephrine, reuptake, inhibitors, snris, or, monoamine, oxidase, inhibitors, maois, may, be, helpful, in, some, cases, ssris, snris, act, on, serotonin, a, neurotransmitter, in, the, brain, because, of, serotonin, s, positive, impacts, on, mood, an, antidepressant, may, be, offered, and, prescribed, as, a, treatment, option, for, social, anxiety, the, ssris, sertraline, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, and, the, snri, venlafaxine, have, fda, approval, similar, medications, may, be, offered, for, agoraphobia, sedatives, such, as, benzodiazepines, clonazepam, alprazolam, are, another, therapeutic, option, which, can, help, people, relax, by, reducing, the, amount, of, anxiety, they, feel, benzodiazepines, may, be, useful, in, the, acute, treatment, of, severe, symptoms, but, the, risk, benefit, ratio, usually, goes, against, their, long, term, use, in, phobic, disorders, this, class, of, medication, has, recently, been, shown, as, effective, if, used, with, negative, behaviours, such, as, excessive, alcohol, use, despite, this, positive, finding, benzodiazepines, are, used, with, caution, due, to, side, effects, and, risk, of, developing, dependence, or, withdrawal, symptoms, in, specific, phobia, for, example, if, the, phobic, stimulus, is, one, that, is, not, regularly, encountered, such, as, flying, a, short, course, may, be, provided, beta, blockers, propranolol, are, another, therapeutic, option, particularly, for, those, with, the, performance, only, subtype, of, social, anxiety, disorder, they, may, stop, the, stimulating, effects, of, adrenaline, such, as, sweating, increased, heart, rate, elevated, blood, pressure, tremors, and, the, feeling, of, a, pounding, heart, by, taking, beta, blockers, before, a, phobic, event, these, symptoms, are, decreased, making, the, event, less, frightening, beta, blockers, are, not, effective, for, generalized, social, anxiety, disorder, hypnotherapy, is, another, effective, therapy, that, uses, hypnosis, to, help, manage, anxiety, and, stress, this, therapy, can, help, people, gain, control, over, their, phobias, hypnotherapy, can, be, used, alone, and, in, conjunction, with, systematic, desensitization, to, treat, phobias, through, hypnotherapy, the, underlying, cause, of, the, phobia, may, be, uncovered, the, phobia, may, be, caused, by, a, past, event, that, the, person, does, not, remember, a, phenomenon, known, as, repression, the, mind, represses, traumatic, memories, from, the, conscious, mind, until, the, person, is, ready, to, deal, with, them, hypnotherapy, may, also, eliminate, the, conditioned, responses, that, occur, during, different, situations, people, are, first, placed, into, a, hypnotic, trance, an, extremely, relaxed, state, in, which, the, unconscious, can, be, retrieved, this, state, makes, people, more, open, to, suggestion, which, helps, bring, about, desired, change, consciously, addressing, old, memories,
