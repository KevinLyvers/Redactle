snakebirds, are, mainly, tropical, waterbirds, in, the, family, anhingidae, which, contains, a, single, genus, anhinga, there, are, four, living, species, three, of, which, are, very, common, and, widespread, while, the, fourth, is, rarer, and, classified, as, near, threatened, by, the, iucn, the, term, snakebird, is, usually, used, without, any, additions, to, signify, whichever, of, the, completely, allopatric, species, occurs, in, any, one, region, it, refers, to, their, long, thin, neck, which, has, a, snake, like, appearance, when, they, swim, with, their, bodies, submerged, or, when, mated, pairs, twist, it, during, their, bonding, displays, darter, is, used, with, a, geographical, term, when, referring, to, particular, species, it, alludes, to, their, manner, of, procuring, food, as, they, impale, fishes, with, their, thin, pointed, beak, the, american, darter, a, anhinga, is, more, commonly, known, as, the, anhinga, it, is, sometimes, called, water, turkey, in, the, southern, united, states, though, the, anhinga, is, quite, unrelated, to, the, wild, turkey, they, are, both, large, blackish, birds, with, long, tails, that, are, sometimes, hunted, for, food, anhingidae, are, large, birds, with, sexually, dimorphic, plumage, they, measure, about, 80, to, 100, cm, 2, 6, to, 3, 3, ft, in, length, with, a, wingspan, around, 120, cm, 3, 9, ft, and, weigh, some, 1, 050, to, 1, 350, grams, 37, to, 48, oz, the, males, have, black, and, dark, brown, plumage, a, short, erectile, crest, on, the, nape, and, a, larger, bill, than, the, female, the, females, have, much, paler, plumage, especially, on, the, neck, and, underparts, and, are, a, bit, larger, overall, both, have, grey, stippling, on, long, scapulars, and, upper, wing, coverts, the, sharply, pointed, bill, has, serrated, edges, a, desmognathous, palate, and, no, external, nostrils, the, darters, have, completely, webbed, feet, and, their, legs, are, short, and, set, far, back, on, the, body, there, is, no, eclipse, plumage, but, the, bare, parts, vary, in, color, around, the, year, during, breeding, however, their, small, gular, sac, changes, from, pink, or, yellow, to, black, and, the, bare, facial, skin, otherwise, yellow, or, yellow, green, turns, turquoise, the, iris, changes, in, color, between, yellow, red, or, brown, seasonally, the, young, hatch, naked, but, soon, grow, white, or, tan, down, darter, vocalizations, include, a, clicking, or, rattling, when, flying, or, perching, in, the, nesting, colonies, adults, communicate, with, croaks, grunts, or, rattles, during, breeding, adults, sometimes, give, a, caw, or, sighing, or, hissing, calls, nestlings, communicate, with, squealing, or, squawking, calls, darters, are, mostly, tropical, in, distribution, ranging, into, subtropical, and, barely, into, warm, temperate, regions, they, typically, inhabit, fresh, water, lakes, rivers, marshes, swamps, and, are, less, often, found, along, the, seashore, in, brackish, estuaries, bays, lagoons, and, mangrove, most, are, sedentary, and, do, not, migrate, the, populations, in, the, coolest, parts, of, the, range, may, migrate, however, their, preferred, mode, of, flight, is, soaring, and, gliding, in, flapping, flight, they, are, rather, cumbersome, on, dry, land, darters, walk, with, a, high, stepped, gait, wings, often, spread, for, balance, just, like, pelicans, do, they, tend, to, gather, in, flocks, sometimes, up, to, about, 100, birds, and, frequently, associate, with, storks, herons, or, ibises, but, are, highly, territorial, on, the, nest, despite, being, a, colonial, nester, breeding, pairs, especially, males, will, stab, at, any, other, bird, that, ventures, within, reach, of, their, long, neck, and, bill, the, oriental, darter, a, melanogaster, sensu, stricto, is, a, near, threatened, species, habitat, destruction, along, with, other, human, interferences, such, as, egg, collection, and, pesticide, overuse, are, the, main, reasons, for, declining, darter, populations, darters, feed, mainly, on, mid, sized, fish, far, more, rarely, they, eat, other, aquatic, vertebrates, and, large, invertebrates, of, comparable, size, these, birds, are, foot, propelled, divers, which, quietly, stalk, and, ambush, their, prey, then, they, use, their, sharply, pointed, bill, to, impale, the, food, animal, they, do, not, dive, deep, but, make, use, of, their, low, buoyancy, made, possible, by, wettable, plumage, small, air, sacs, and, denser, bones, on, the, underside, of, the, cervical, vertebrae, 5, 7, is, a, keel, which, allows, for, muscles, to, attach, to, form, a, hinge, like, mechanism, that, can, project, the, neck, head, and, bill, forward, like, a, throwing, spear, after, they, have, stabbed, the, prey, they, return, to, the, surface, where, they, toss, their, food, into, the, air, and, catch, it, again, so, that, they, can, swallow, it, head, first, like, cormorants, they, have, a, vestigial, preen, gland, and, their, plumage, gets, wet, during, diving, to, dry, their, feathers, after, diving, darters, move, to, a, safe, location, and, spread, their, wings, darters, go, through, a, synchronous, moult, of, all, their, primaries, and, secondaries, making, them, temporarily, flightless, although, it, is, possible, that, some, individuals, go, through, incomplete, moults, predators, of, darters, are, mainly, large, carnivorous, birds, including, passerines, like, the, australian, raven, corvus, coronoides, and, house, crow, corvus, splendens, and, birds, of, prey, such, as, marsh, harriers, circus, aeruginosus, complex, or, pallas, s, fish, eagle, haliaeetus, leucoryphus, predation, by, crocodylus, crocodiles, has, also, been, noted, but, many, would, be, predators, know, better, than, to, try, to, catch, a, darter, the, long, neck, and, pointed, bill, in, combination, with, the, darting, mechanism, make, the, birds, dangerous, even, to, larger, carnivorous, mammals, and, they, will, actually, move, toward, an, intruder, to, attack, rather, than, defending, passively, or, fleeing, they, usually, breed, in, colonies, occasionally, mixed, with, cormorants, or, herons, the, darters, pair, bond, monogamously, at, least, for, a, breeding, season, there, are, many, different, types, of, displays, used, for, mating, males, display, to, attract, females, by, raising, but, not, stretching, their, wings, to, wave, them, in, an, alternating, fashion, bowing, and, snapping, the, bill, or, giving, twigs, to, potential, mates, to, strengthen, the, pair, bond, partners, rub, their, bills, or, wave, point, upwards, or, bow, their, necks, in, unison, when, one, partner, comes, to, relieve, the, other, at, the, nest, males, and, females, use, the, same, display, the, male, employs, during, courtship, during, changeovers, the, birds, may, also, yawn, at, each, other, breeding, is, seasonal, peaking, in, march, april, at, the, northern, end, of, their, range, elsewhere, they, can, be, found, breeding, all, year, round, the, nests, are, made, of, twigs, and, lined, with, leaves, they, are, built, in, trees, or, reeds, usually, near, water, typically, the, male, gathers, nesting, material, and, brings, it, to, the, female, which, does, most, of, the, actual, construction, work, nest, construction, takes, only, a, few, days, about, three, at, most, and, the, pairs, copulate, at, the, nest, site, the, clutch, size, is, two, to, six, eggs, usually, about, four, which, have, a, pale, green, color, the, eggs, are, laid, within, 24, 48, hours, and, incubated, for, 25, to, 30, days, starting, after, the, first, has, been, laid, they, hatch, asynchronously, to, provide, warmth, to, the, eggs, the, parents, will, cover, them, with, their, large, webbed, feet, because, like, their, relatives, they, lack, a, brood, patch, the, last, young, to, hatch, will, usually, starve, in, years, with, little, food, available, bi, parental, care, is, given, and, the, young, are, considered, altricial, they, are, fed, by, regurgitation, of, partly, digested, food, when, young, switching, to, entire, food, items, as, they, grow, older, after, fledging, the, young, are, fed, for, about, two, more, weeks, while, they, learn, to, hunt, for, themselves, these, birds, reach, sexual, maturity, by, about, two, years, and, generally, live, to, around, nine, years, the, maximum, possible, lifespan, of, darters, seems, to, be, about, sixteen, years, darter, eggs, are, edible, and, considered, delicious, by, some, they, are, locally, collected, by, humans, as, food, the, adults, are, also, eaten, occasionally, as, they, are, rather, meaty, birds, comparable, to, a, domestic, duck, like, other, fish, eating, birds, such, as, cormorants, or, seaducks, they, do, not, taste, particularly, good, though, darter, eggs, and, nestlings, are, also, collected, in, a, few, places, to, raise, the, young, sometimes, this, is, done, for, food, but, some, nomads, in, assam, and, bengal, train, tame, darters, to, be, employed, as, in, cormorant, fishing, with, an, increasing, number, of, nomads, settling, down, in, recent, decades, this, cultural, heritage, is, in, danger, of, being, lost, on, the, other, hand, as, evidenced, by, the, etymology, of, anhinga, detailed, below, the, tupi, seem, to, have, considered, the, anhinga, a, kind, of, bird, of, ill, omen, the, genus, anhinga, was, introduced, by, the, french, zoologist, mathurin, jacques, brisson, in, 1760, with, the, anhinga, or, american, darter, anhinga, anhinga, as, the, type, species, anhinga, is, derived, from, the, tupi, aj, a, also, transcribed, yinga, or, aying, which, in, local, mythology, refers, to, a, malevolent, demonic, forest, spirit, it, is, often, translated, as, devil, bird, the, name, changed, to, anhing, or, anhang, as, it, was, transferred, to, the, tupi, portuguese, l, ngua, geral, however, in, its, first, documented, use, as, an, english, term, in, 1818, it, referred, to, an, old, world, darter, ever, since, it, has, also, been, used, for, the, modern, genus, anhinga, as, a, whole, this, family, is, very, closely, related, to, the, other, families, in, the, suborder, sulae, i, e, the, phalacrocoracidae, cormorants, and, shags, and, the, sulidae, gannets, and, boobies, cormorants, and, darters, are, extremely, similar, as, regards, their, body, and, leg, skeletons, and, may, be, sister, taxa, in, fact, several, darter, fossils, were, initially, believed, to, be, cormorants, or, shags, see, below, some, earlier, authors, included, the, darters, in, the, phalacrocoracidae, as, subfamily, anhingina, but, this, is, nowadays, generally, considered, overlumping, however, as, this, agrees, quite, well, with, the, fossil, evidence, some, unite, the, anhingidae, and, phalacrocoracidae, in, a, superfamily, phalacrocoracoidea, the, sulae, are, also, united, by, their, characteristic, display, behavior, which, agrees, with, the, phylogeny, as, laid, out, by, anatomical, and, dna, sequence, data, while, the, darters, lack, of, many, display, behaviors, is, shared, with, gannets, and, that, of, a, few, with, cormorants, these, are, all, symplesiomorphies, that, are, absent, in, frigatebirds, tropicbirds, and, pelicans, also, like, cormorants, but, unlike, other, birds, darters, use, their, hyoid, bone, to, stretch, the, gular, sac, in, display, whether, the, pointing, display, of, mates, is, another, synapomorphy, of, darters, and, cormorants, that, was, dropped, again, in, some, of, the, latter, or, whether, it, evolved, independently, in, darters, and, those, cormorants, that, do, it, is, not, clear, the, male, raised, wing, display, seems, to, be, a, synapomorphy, of, the, sulae, like, almost, all, cormorants, and, shags, but, unlike, almost, all, gannets, and, boobies, darters, keep, their, wrists, bent, as, they, lift, the, wings, in, display, but, their, alternating, wing, waving, which, they, also, show, before, take, off, is, unique, that, they, often, balance, with, their, outstretched, wings, during, walking, is, probably, an, autapomorphy, of, darters, necessitated, by, their, being, plumper, than, the, other, sulae, the, sulae, were, traditionally, included, in, the, pelecaniformes, then, a, paraphyletic, group, of, higher, waterbirds, the, supposed, traits, uniting, them, like, all, webbed, toes, and, a, bare, gular, sac, are, now, known, to, be, convergent, and, pelicans, are, apparently, closer, relatives, of, storks, than, of, the, sulae, hence, the, sulae, and, the, frigatebirds, and, some, prehistoric, relatives, are, increasingly, separated, as, the, suliformes, which, is, sometimes, dubbed, phalacrocoraciformes, there, are, four, living, species, of, darters, recognized, all, in, the, genus, anhinga, although, the, old, world, ones, were, often, lumped, together, as, subspecies, of, a, melanogaster, they, may, form, a, superspecies, with, regard, to, the, more, distinct, anhinga, extinct, darters, from, mauritius, and, australia, known, only, from, bones, were, described, as, anhinga, nana, mauritian, darter, and, anhinga, parva, but, these, are, actually, misidentified, bones, of, the, long, tailed, cormorant, microcarbo, phalacrocorax, africanus, and, the, little, pied, cormorant, m, p, melanoleucos, respectively, in, the, former, case, however, the, remains, are, larger, than, those, of, the, geographically, closest, extant, population, of, long, tailed, cormorants, on, madagascar, they, thus, might, belong, to, an, extinct, subspecies, mauritian, cormorant, which, would, have, to, be, called, microcarbo, africanus, nanus, or, phalacrocorax, a, nanus, quite, ironically, as, the, latin, term, nanus, means, dwarf, the, late, pleistocene, anhinga, laticeps, is, not, specifically, distinct, from, the, australasian, darter, it, might, have, been, a, large, paleosubspecies, of, the, last, ice, age, the, fossil, record, of, the, anhingidae, is, rather, dense, but, very, apomorphic, already, and, appears, to, be, lacking, its, base, the, other, families, placed, in, the, phalacrocoraciformes, sequentially, appear, throughout, the, eocene, the, most, distinct, frigatebirds, being, known, since, almost, 50, ma, million, years, ago, and, probably, of, paleocene, origin, with, fossil, gannets, being, known, since, the, mid, eocene, c, 40, ma, and, fossil, cormorants, appearing, soon, thereafter, the, origin, of, the, darters, as, a, distinct, lineage, was, presumably, around, 50, 40, ma, maybe, a, bit, earlier, fossil, anhingidae, are, known, since, the, early, miocene, a, number, of, prehistoric, darters, similar, to, those, still, alive, have, been, described, as, well, as, some, more, distinct, genera, now, extinct, the, diversity, was, highest, in, south, america, and, thus, it, is, likely, that, the, family, originated, there, some, of, the, genera, which, ultimately, became, extinct, were, very, large, and, a, tendency, to, become, flightless, has, been, noted, in, prehistoric, darters, their, distinctness, has, been, doubted, but, this, was, due, to, the, supposed, anhinga, fraileyi, being, rather, similar, to, macranhinga, rather, than, due, to, them, resembling, the, living, species, prehistoric, members, of, anhinga, were, presumably, distributed, in, similar, climates, as, today, ranging, into, europe, in, the, hotter, and, wetter, miocene, with, their, considerable, stamina, and, continent, wide, distribution, abilities, as, evidenced, by, the, anhinga, and, the, old, world, superspecies, the, smaller, lineage, has, survived, for, over, 20, ma, as, evidenced, by, the, fossil, species, biogeography, centered, around, the, equator, with, the, younger, species, ranging, eastwards, out, of, the, americas, the, hadley, cell, seems, to, have, been, the, main, driver, of, the, genus, success, and, survival, protoplotus, a, small, paleogene, phalacrocoraciform, from, sumatra, was, in, old, times, considered, a, primitive, darter, however, it, is, also, placed, in, its, own, family, protoplotidae, and, might, be, a, basal, member, of, the, sulae, and, or, close, to, the, common, ancestor, of, cormorants, and, darters
