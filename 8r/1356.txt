chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, is, a, type, of, progressive, lung, disease, characterized, by, long, term, respiratory, symptoms, and, airflow, limitation, gold, 2024, defined, copd, as, a, heterogeneous, lung, condition, characterized, by, chronic, respiratory, symptoms, dyspnea, or, shortness, of, breath, cough, sputum, production, and, or, exacerbations, due, to, abnormalities, of, the, airways, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and, or, alveoli, emphysema, that, cause, persistent, often, progressive, airflow, obstruction, the, main, symptoms, of, copd, include, shortness, of, breath, and, a, cough, which, may, or, may, not, produce, mucus, copd, progressively, worsens, with, everyday, activities, such, as, walking, or, dressing, becoming, difficult, while, copd, is, incurable, it, is, preventable, and, treatable, the, two, most, common, types, of, copd, are, emphysema, and, chronic, bronchitis, and, have, been, the, two, classic, copd, phenotypes, however, this, basic, dogma, has, been, challenged, as, varying, degrees, of, co, existing, emphysema, chronic, bronchitis, and, potentially, significant, vascular, diseases, have, all, been, acknowledged, in, those, with, copd, giving, rise, to, the, classification, of, other, phenotypes, or, subtypes, emphysema, is, defined, as, enlarged, airspaces, alveoli, whose, walls, have, broken, down, resulting, in, permanent, damage, to, the, lung, tissue, chronic, bronchitis, is, defined, as, a, productive, cough, that, is, present, for, at, least, three, months, each, year, for, two, years, both, of, these, conditions, can, exist, without, airflow, limitation, when, they, are, not, classed, as, copd, emphysema, is, just, one, of, the, structural, abnormalities, that, can, limit, airflow, and, can, exist, without, airflow, limitation, in, a, significant, number, of, people, chronic, bronchitis, does, not, always, result, in, airflow, limitation, however, in, young, adults, with, chronic, bronchitis, who, smoke, the, risk, of, developing, copd, is, high, many, definitions, of, copd, in, the, past, included, emphysema, and, chronic, bronchitis, but, these, have, never, been, included, in, gold, report, definitions, emphysema, and, chronic, bronchitis, remain, the, predominant, phenotypes, of, copd, but, there, is, often, overlap, between, them, and, a, number, of, other, phenotypes, have, also, been, described, copd, and, asthma, may, coexist, and, converge, in, some, individuals, copd, is, associated, with, low, grade, systemic, inflammation, the, most, common, cause, of, copd, is, tobacco, smoking, other, risk, factors, include, indoor, and, outdoor, air, pollution, including, dust, exposure, to, occupational, irritants, such, as, dust, from, grains, cadmium, dust, or, fumes, and, genetics, such, as, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, deficiency, in, developing, countries, common, sources, of, household, air, pollution, are, the, use, of, coal, and, biomass, such, as, wood, and, dry, dung, as, fuel, for, cooking, and, heating, the, diagnosis, is, based, on, poor, airflow, as, measured, by, spirometry, most, cases, of, copd, can, be, prevented, by, reducing, exposure, to, risk, factors, such, as, smoking, and, indoor, and, outdoor, pollutants, while, treatment, can, slow, worsening, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, that, any, medications, can, change, the, long, term, decline, in, lung, function, copd, treatments, include, smoking, cessation, vaccinations, pulmonary, rehabilitation, inhaled, bronchodilators, and, corticosteroids, some, people, may, benefit, from, long, term, oxygen, therapy, lung, volume, reduction, and, lung, transplantation, in, those, who, have, periods, of, acute, worsening, increased, use, of, medications, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and, hospitalization, may, be, needed, as, of, 2015, copd, affected, about, 174, 5, million, people, 2, 4, of, the, global, population, it, typically, occurs, in, males, and, females, over, the, age, of, 35, 40, in, 2019, it, caused, 3, 2, million, deaths, 80, occurring, in, lower, and, middle, income, countries, up, from, 2, 4, million, deaths, in, 1990, in, 2021, it, was, the, fourth, biggest, cause, of, death, responsible, for, approximately, 5, of, total, deaths, the, number, of, deaths, is, projected, to, increase, further, because, of, continued, exposure, to, risk, factors, and, an, aging, population, in, the, united, states, in, 2010, the, economic, cost, was, put, at, us, 32, 1, billion, and, projected, to, rise, to, us, 49, billion, in, 2020, in, the, united, kingdom, this, cost, is, estimated, at, 3, 8, billion, annually, a, cardinal, symptom, of, copd, is, the, chronic, and, progressive, shortness, of, breath, which, is, most, characteristic, of, the, condition, shortness, of, breath, breathlessness, is, often, the, most, distressing, symptom, responsible, for, the, associated, anxiety, and, level, of, disability, experienced, symptoms, of, wheezing, and, chest, tightness, associated, with, breathlessness, can, be, variable, over, the, course, of, a, day, or, between, days, and, are, not, always, present, chest, tightness, often, follows, exertion, many, people, with, more, advanced, copd, breathe, through, pursed, lips, which, can, improve, shortness, of, breath, shortness, of, breath, is, often, responsible, for, reduced, physical, activity, and, low, levels, of, physical, activity, are, associated, with, worse, outcomes, in, severe, and, very, severe, cases, there, may, be, constant, tiredness, weight, loss, muscle, loss, and, anorexia, people, with, copd, often, have, increased, breathlessness, and, frequent, colds, before, seeking, treatment, the, most, often, first, symptom, of, copd, is, a, chronic, cough, which, may, or, may, not, be, productive, of, mucus, as, phlegm, phlegm, coughed, up, as, sputum, can, be, intermittent, and, may, be, swallowed, or, spat, out, depending, on, social, or, cultural, factors, and, is, therefore, not, always, easy, to, evaluate, however, an, accompanying, productive, cough, is, only, seen, in, up, to, 30, of, cases, sometimes, limited, airflow, may, develop, in, the, absence, of, a, cough, symptoms, are, usually, worse, in, the, morning, a, chronic, productive, cough, is, the, result, of, mucus, hypersecretion, and, when, it, persists, for, more, than, three, months, each, year, for, at, least, two, years, it, is, defined, as, chronic, bronchitis, chronic, bronchitis, can, occur, before, the, restricted, airflow, diagnostic, of, copd, some, people, with, copd, attribute, the, symptoms, to, the, consequences, of, smoking, in, severe, copd, vigorous, coughing, may, lead, to, rib, fractures, or, to, a, brief, loss, of, consciousness, an, acute, exacerbation, is, a, sudden, worsening, of, signs, and, symptoms, that, lasts, for, several, days, the, key, symptom, is, increased, breathlessness, other, more, pronounced, symptoms, are, of, excessive, mucus, increased, cough, and, wheeze, a, commonly, found, sign, is, air, trapping, giving, a, difficulty, in, complete, exhalation, the, usual, cause, of, an, exacerbation, is, a, viral, infection, most, often, the, common, cold, the, common, cold, is, usually, associated, with, the, winter, months, but, can, occur, at, any, time, other, respiratory, infections, may, be, bacterial, or, in, combination, sometimes, secondary, to, a, viral, infection, the, most, common, bacterial, infection, is, caused, by, haemophilus, influenzae, other, risks, include, exposure, to, tobacco, smoke, active, and, passive, and, environmental, pollutants, both, indoor, and, outdoor, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, hospital, admissions, for, copd, exacerbations, sharply, decreased, which, may, be, attributable, to, reduction, of, emissions, and, cleaner, air, there, has, also, been, a, marked, decrease, in, the, number, of, cold, and, flu, infections, during, this, time, smoke, from, wildfires, is, proving, an, increasing, risk, in, many, parts, of, the, world, and, government, agencies, have, published, protective, advice, on, their, websites, in, the, us, the, epa, advises, that, the, use, of, dust, masks, do, not, give, protection, from, the, fine, particles, in, wildfires, and, instead, advise, the, use, of, well, fitting, particulate, masks, this, same, advice, is, offered, in, canada, and, australia, to, the, effects, of, their, forest, fires, the, number, of, exacerbations, is, not, seen, to, relate, to, any, stage, of, the, disease, those, with, two, or, more, a, year, are, classed, as, frequent, exacerbators, and, these, lead, to, a, worsening, in, the, disease, progression, frailty, in, ageing, increases, exacerbations, and, hospitalization, acute, exacerbations, in, copd, are, often, unexplained, and, thought, to, have, many, causes, other, than, infections, a, study, has, emphasized, the, possibility, of, a, pulmonary, embolism, as, sometimes, being, responsible, in, these, cases, signs, can, include, pleuritic, chest, pain, and, heart, failure, without, signs, of, infection, such, emboli, could, respond, to, anticoagulants, copd, often, occurs, along, with, a, number, of, other, conditions, comorbidities, due, in, part, to, shared, risk, factors, common, comorbidities, include, cardiovascular, disease, skeletal, muscle, dysfunction, metabolic, syndrome, osteoporosis, depression, anxiety, asthma, and, lung, cancer, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, deficiency, a1ad, is, an, important, risk, factor, for, copd, it, is, advised, that, everybody, with, copd, be, screened, for, a1ad, metabolic, syndrome, has, been, seen, to, affect, up, to, fifty, percent, of, those, with, copd, and, significantly, affects, the, outcomes, when, comorbid, with, copd, there, is, more, systemic, inflammation, it, is, not, known, if, it, co, exists, with, copd, or, develops, as, a, consequence, of, the, pathology, metabolic, syndrome, on, its, own, has, a, high, rate, of, morbidity, and, mortality, and, this, rate, is, amplified, when, comorbid, with, copd, tuberculosis, is, a, risk, factor, for, the, development, of, copd, and, is, also, a, potential, comorbidity, most, people, with, copd, die, from, comorbidities, and, not, from, respiratory, problems, anxiety, and, depression, are, often, complications, of, copd, other, complications, include, a, reduced, quality, of, life, and, increased, disability, cor, pulmonale, frequent, chest, infections, including, pneumonia, secondary, polycythemia, respiratory, failure, pneumothorax, lung, cancer, and, cachexia, muscle, wasting, cognitive, impairment, is, common, in, those, with, copd, as, it, is, for, other, lung, conditions, that, affect, airflow, cognitive, impairment, is, associated, with, the, declining, ability, to, cope, with, the, basic, activities, of, daily, living, it, is, unclear, if, those, with, copd, are, at, greater, risk, of, contracting, covid, 19, though, if, infected, they, are, at, risk, of, hospitalization, and, developing, severe, covid, 19, however, there, are, laboratory, and, clinical, studies, showing, a, possibility, of, certain, inhaled, corticosteroids, for, copd, providing, a, protective, role, against, covid, 19, differentiating, covid, 19, symptoms, from, an, exacerbation, is, difficult, mild, prodromal, symptoms, may, delay, its, recognition, and, where, they, include, loss, of, taste, or, smell, covid, 19, is, to, be, suspected, many, definitions, of, copd, in, the, past, included, chronic, bronchitis, and, emphysema, but, these, have, never, been, included, in, gold, report, definitions, emphysema, is, defined, as, enlarged, airspaces, alveoli, whose, walls, break, down, resulting, in, permanent, damage, to, the, lung, tissue, and, is, just, one, of, the, structural, abnormalities, that, can, limit, airflow, the, condition, can, exist, without, airflow, limitation, but, commonly, it, does, chronic, bronchitis, is, defined, as, a, productive, cough, that, is, present, for, at, least, three, months, each, year, for, two, years, but, does, not, always, result, in, airflow, limitation, although, the, risk, of, developing, copd, is, great, these, older, definitions, grouped, the, two, types, as, type, a, and, type, b, type, a, were, emphysema, types, known, as, pink, puffers, due, to, their, pink, complexion, fast, breathing, rate, and, pursed, lips, type, b, were, chronic, bronchitic, types, referred, to, as, blue, bloaters, due, to, low, oxygen, levels, causing, a, bluish, color, to, the, skin, and, lips, and, swollen, ankles, these, differences, were, suggested, to, be, due, to, the, presence, or, not, of, collateral, ventilation, evident, in, emphysema, and, lacking, in, chronic, bronchitis, this, terminology, was, no, longer, accepted, as, useful, as, most, people, with, copd, have, a, combination, of, both, emphysema, and, airway, disease, these, are, now, recognized, as, the, two, major, phenotypes, of, copd, emphysematous, phenotype, and, chronic, bronchitic, phenotype, it, has, since, been, recognized, that, copd, is, more, complex, with, a, diverse, group, of, disorders, of, differing, risk, factors, and, clinical, courses, that, has, resulted, in, a, number, of, subtypes, or, phenotypes, of, copd, being, accepted, and, proposed, the, two, classic, emphysematous, and, chronic, bronchitic, phenotypes, are, fundamentally, different, conditions, with, unique, underlying, mechanisms, another, subtype, of, copd, categorized, by, some, as, a, separate, clinical, entity, is, asthma, copd, overlap, which, is, a, condition, sharing, clinical, features, of, both, asthma, and, copd, spirometry, measures, are, inadequate, for, defining, phenotypes, and, chest, x, ray, ct, and, mri, scans, have, been, mostly, employed, most, cases, of, copd, are, diagnosed, at, a, late, stage, and, the, use, of, imaging, methods, would, allow, earlier, detection, and, treatment, the, identification, and, recognition, of, different, phenotypes, can, guide, appropriate, treatment, approaches, for, example, the, pde4, inhibitor, roflumilast, is, targeted, at, the, chronic, bronchitic, phenotype, two, inflammatory, phenotypes, show, a, phenotype, stability, the, neutrophilic, inflammatory, phenotype, and, the, eosinophilic, inflammatory, phenotype, mepolizumab, a, monoclonal, antibody, has, been, shown, to, have, benefit, in, treating, the, eosinophilic, inflammatory, type, rather, than, the, use, of, oral, corticosteroids, but, further, studies, have, been, called, for, another, recognized, phenotype, is, the, frequent, exacerbator, the, frequent, exacerbator, has, two, or, more, exacerbations, a, year, has, a, poor, prognosis, and, is, described, as, a, moderately, stable, phenotype, a, pulmonary, vascular, copd, phenotype, has, been, described, due, to, cardiovascular, dysfunction, a, molecular, phenotype, of, cftr, dysfunction, is, shared, with, cystic, fibrosis, a, combined, phenotype, of, chronic, bronchitis, and, bronchiectasis, has, been, described, with, a, difficulty, noted, of, determining, the, best, treatment, the, only, genotype, is, the, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, deficiency, aatd, genetic, subtype, and, this, has, a, specific, treatment, the, cause, of, the, development, of, copd, is, the, exposure, to, harmful, particles, or, gases, including, tobacco, smoke, that, irritate, the, lung, causing, inflammation, that, interacts, with, a, number, of, host, factors, such, exposure, needs, to, be, significant, or, long, term, the, greatest, risk, factor, for, the, development, of, copd, is, tobacco, smoke, however, less, than, 50, percent, of, heavy, smokers, develop, copd, so, other, factors, need, to, be, considered, including, exposure, to, indoor, and, outdoor, pollutants, allergens, occupational, exposure, and, host, factors, one, of, the, known, causes, of, copd, is, the, exposure, to, construction, dust, the, three, main, types, of, construction, dust, are, silica, dust, non, silica, dust, e, g, dust, from, gypsum, cement, limestone, marble, and, dolomite, and, wood, dust, host, factors, include, a, genetic, susceptibility, factors, associated, with, poverty, aging, and, physical, inactivity, asthma, and, tuberculosis, are, also, recognized, as, risk, factors, as, the, comorbidity, of, copd, is, reported, to, be, 12, times, higher, in, patients, with, asthma, after, adjusting, for, smoking, history, in, europe, airway, hyperresponsiveness, is, rated, as, the, second, most, important, risk, factor, after, smoking, a, host, factor, of, an, airway, branching, variation, arising, during, development, has, been, described, the, respiratory, tree, is, a, filter, for, harmful, substances, and, any, variant, has, the, potential, to, disrupt, this, a, variation, has, been, found, to, be, associated, with, the, development, of, chronic, bronchitis, and, another, with, the, development, of, emphysema, a, branch, variant, in, the, central, airway, is, specifically, associated, with, an, increased, susceptibility, for, the, later, development, of, copd, a, genetic, association, for, the, variants, has, been, sometimes, found, with, fgf10, alcohol, abuse, can, lead, to, alcoholic, lung, disease, and, is, seen, to, be, an, independent, risk, factor, for, copd, mucociliary, clearance, is, disrupted, by, chronic, exposure, to, alcohol, macrophage, activity, is, diminished, and, an, inflammatory, response, promoted, the, damage, leads, to, a, susceptibility, for, infection, including, covid, 19, more, so, when, combined, with, smoking, smoking, induces, the, upregulation, of, the, expression, of, ace2, a, receptor, for, the, sars, cov, 2, virus, the, primary, risk, factor, for, copd, globally, is, tobacco, smoking, with, an, increased, rate, of, developing, copd, shown, in, smokers, and, ex, smokers, of, those, who, smoke, about, 20, will, get, copd, increasing, to, less, than, 50, in, heavy, smokers, in, the, united, states, and, united, kingdom, of, those, with, copd, 80, 95, are, either, current, or, previous, smokers, several, studies, indicate, that, women, are, more, susceptible, than, men, to, the, harmful, effects, of, tobacco, smoke, for, the, same, amount, of, cigarette, smoking, women, have, a, higher, risk, of, copd, than, men, in, non, smokers, exposure, to, second, hand, smoke, passive, smoking, is, the, cause, of, 1, 2, million, deaths, from, the, more, than, 8, million, deaths, worldwide, each, year, due, to, tobacco, smoke, women, who, smoke, during, pregnancy, and, during, the, early, life, of, the, child, is, a, risk, factor, for, the, later, development, of, copd, in, their, child, inhaled, smoke, triggers, the, release, of, excessive, proteases, in, lungs, which, then, degrades, elastin, the, major, component, of, alveoli, smoke, also, impairs, the, action, of, cilia, inhibiting, mucociliary, clearance, that, clears, the, bronchi, of, mucus, cellular, debris, and, unwanted, fluid, other, types, of, tobacco, smoke, such, as, from, cigar, pipe, water, pipe, and, hookah, use, also, confer, a, risk, water, pipe, or, hookah, smoke, appears, to, be, as, harmful, or, even, more, harmful, than, smoking, cigarettes, marijuana, is, the, second, most, commonly, smoked, substance, but, evidence, linking, its, use, to, copd, is, very, limited, limited, evidence, shows, that, marijuana, does, not, accelerate, lung, function, decline, a, low, use, of, marijuana, gives, a, bronchodilatory, effect, rather, than, the, bronchoconstrictive, effect, from, tobacco, use, but, it, is, often, smoked, in, combination, with, tobacco, or, on, its, own, by, tobacco, smokers, higher, use, however, has, shown, a, decline, in, the, fev1, there, is, evidence, of, it, causing, some, respiratory, problems, and, its, use, in, combination, may, have, a, cumulative, toxic, effect, suggesting, it, as, a, risk, factor, for, spontaneous, pneumothorax, bullous, emphysema, copd, and, lung, cancer, a, noted, difference, between, marijuana, use, and, tobacco, was, that, respiratory, problems, were, resolved, with, stopping, usage, unlike, the, continued, decline, with, stopping, tobacco, smoking, respiratory, symptoms, reported, with, marijuana, use, included, chronic, cough, increased, sputum, production, and, wheezing, but, not, shortness, of, breath, also, these, symptoms, were, typically, reported, ten, years, ahead, of, their, affecting, tobacco, smokers, another, study, found, that, chronic, marijuana, smokers, even, with, the, additional, use, of, tobacco, developed, similar, respiratory, problems, but, did, not, seem, to, develop, airflow, limitation, and, copd, exposure, to, particulates, can, bring, about, the, development, of, copd, or, its, exacerbations, those, with, copd, are, more, susceptible, to, the, harmful, effects, of, particulate, exposure, that, can, cause, acute, exacerbations, brought, about, by, infections, black, carbon, also, known, as, soot, is, an, air, pollutant, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, hospitalization, due, to, the, exacerbations, caused, long, term, exposure, is, indicated, as, an, increased, rate, of, mortality, in, copd, studies, have, shown, that, people, who, live, in, large, cities, have, a, higher, rate, of, copd, compared, to, people, who, live, in, rural, areas, areas, with, poor, outdoor, air, quality, including, that, from, exhaust, gas, generally, have, higher, rates, of, copd, urban, air, pollution, significantly, effects, the, developing, lung, and, its, maturation, and, contributes, a, potential, risk, factor, for, the, later, development, of, copd, the, overall, effect, in, relation, to, smoking, is, believed, to, be, small, poorly, ventilated, fires, used, for, cooking, and, heating, are, often, fueled, by, coal, or, biomass, such, as, wood, and, dry, dung, leading, to, indoor, air, pollution, and, are, one, of, the, most, common, causes, of, copd, in, developing, countries, women, are, affected, more, as, they, have, a, greater, exposure, these, fuels, are, used, as, the, main, source, of, energy, in, 80, of, homes, in, india, china, and, sub, saharan, africa, intense, and, prolonged, exposure, to, workplace, dusts, chemicals, and, fumes, increases, the, risk, of, copd, in, smokers, nonsmokers, and, never, smokers, substances, implicated, in, occupational, exposure, and, listed, in, the, uk, include, organic, and, inorganic, dusts, such, as, cadmium, silica, dust, from, grains, and, flour, and, fumes, from, cadmium, and, welding, that, promote, respiratory, symptoms, workplace, exposure, is, believed, to, be, the, cause, in, 10, 20, of, cases, and, in, the, united, states, it, is, believed, to, be, related, to, around, 30, of, cases, among, never, smokers, and, probably, represents, a, greater, risk, in, countries, without, sufficient, regulations, the, negative, effects, of, dust, exposure, and, cigarette, smoke, exposure, appear, to, be, cumulative, genetics, play, a, role, in, the, development, of, copd, it, is, more, common, among, relatives, of, those, with, copd, who, smoke, than, unrelated, smokers, the, most, well, known, genetic, risk, factor, is, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, deficiency, aatd, and, this, is, the, only, genotype, genetic, subtype, with, a, specific, treatment, this, risk, is, particularly, high, if, someone, deficient, in, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, aat, also, smokes, it, is, responsible, for, about, 1, 5, of, cases, and, the, condition, is, present, in, about, three, to, four, in, 10, 000, people, mutations, in, mmp1, gene, that, encodes, for, interstitial, collagenase, are, associated, with, copd, the, copdgene, study, is, an, ongoing, longitudinal, study, into, the, epidemiology, of, copd, identifying, phenotypes, and, looking, for, their, likely, association, with, susceptible, genes, genome, wide, analyses, in, concert, with, the, international, copd, genetics, consortium, has, identified, more, than, 80, genome, regions, associated, with, copd, and, further, studies, in, these, regions, has, been, called, for, whole, genome, sequencing, is, an, ongoing, collaboration, 2019, with, the, national, heart, lung, and, blood, institute, nhlbi, to, identify, rare, genetic, determinants, copd, is, a, progressive, lung, disease, in, which, chronic, incompletely, reversible, poor, airflow, airflow, limitation, and, an, inability, to, breathe, out, fully, air, trapping, exist, the, poor, airflow, is, the, result, of, small, airways, disease, and, emphysema, the, breakdown, of, lung, tissue, the, relative, contributions, of, these, two, factors, vary, between, people, air, trapping, precedes, lung, hyperinflation, copd, develops, as, a, significant, and, chronic, inflammatory, response, to, inhaled, irritants, which, ultimately, leads, to, bronchial, and, alveolar, remodelling, in, the, lung, known, as, small, airways, disease, thus, airway, remodelling, with, narrowing, of, peripheral, airway, and, emphysema, are, responsible, for, the, alteration, of, lung, function, mucociliary, clearance, is, particularly, altered, with, a, dysregulation, of, cilia, and, mucus, production, small, airway, disease, sometimes, called, chronic, bronchiolitis, appears, to, be, the, precursor, for, the, development, of, emphysema, the, inflammatory, cells, involved, include, neutrophils, and, macrophages, two, types, of, white, blood, cells, those, who, smoke, additionally, have, cytotoxic, t, cell, involvement, and, some, people, with, copd, have, eosinophil, involvement, similar, to, that, in, asthma, part, of, this, cell, response, is, brought, on, by, inflammatory, mediators, such, as, chemotactic, factors, other, processes, involved, with, lung, damage, include, oxidative, stress, produced, by, high, concentrations, of, free, radicals, in, tobacco, smoke, and, released, by, inflammatory, cells, and, breakdown, of, the, connective, tissue, of, the, lungs, by, proteases, particularly, elastase, that, are, insufficiently, inhibited, by, protease, inhibitors, the, destruction, of, the, connective, tissue, of, the, lungs, leads, to, emphysema, which, then, contributes, to, the, poor, airflow, and, finally, poor, absorption, and, release, of, respiratory, gases, general, muscle, wasting, that, often, occurs, in, copd, may, be, partly, due, to, inflammatory, mediators, released, by, the, lungs, into, the, blood, narrowing, of, the, airways, occurs, due, to, inflammation, and, subsequent, scarring, within, them, this, contributes, to, the, inability, to, breathe, out, fully, the, greatest, reduction, in, air, flow, occurs, when, breathing, out, as, the, pressure, in, the, chest, is, compressing, the, airways, at, this, time, this, can, result, in, more, air, from, the, previous, breath, remaining, within, the, lungs, when, the, next, breath, is, started, resulting, in, an, increase, in, the, total, volume, of, air, in, the, lungs, at, any, given, time, a, process, called, air, trapping, which, is, closely, followed, by, hyperinflation, hyperinflation, from, exercise, is, linked, to, shortness, of, breath, in, copd, as, breathing, in, is, less, comfortable, when, the, lungs, are, already, partly, filled, hyperinflation, may, also, worsen, during, an, exacerbation, there, may, also, be, a, degree, of, airway, hyperresponsiveness, to, irritants, similar, to, those, found, in, asthma, low, oxygen, levels, and, eventually, high, carbon, dioxide, levels, in, the, blood, can, occur, from, poor, gas, exchange, due, to, decreased, ventilation, from, airway, obstruction, hyperinflation, and, a, reduced, desire, to, breathe, during, exacerbations, airway, inflammation, is, also, increased, resulting, in, increased, hyperinflation, reduced, expiratory, airflow, and, worsening, of, gas, transfer, this, can, lead, to, low, blood, oxygen, levels, which, if, present, for, a, prolonged, period, can, result, in, narrowing, of, the, arteries, in, the, lungs, while, emphysema, leads, to, the, breakdown, of, capillaries, in, the, lungs, both, of, these, conditions, may, result, in, pulmonary, heart, disease, also, classically, known, as, cor, pulmonale, the, diagnosis, of, copd, should, be, considered, in, anyone, over, the, age, of, 35, to, 40, who, has, shortness, of, breath, a, chronic, cough, sputum, production, or, frequent, winter, colds, and, a, history, of, exposure, to, risk, factors, for, the, disease, spirometry, is, then, used, to, confirm, the, diagnosis, spirometry, measures, the, amount, of, airflow, obstruction, present, and, is, generally, carried, out, after, the, use, of, a, bronchodilator, a, medication, to, open, up, the, airways, two, main, components, are, measured, to, make, the, diagnosis, the, forced, expiratory, volume, in, one, second, fev1, which, is, the, greatest, volume, of, air, that, can, be, breathed, out, in, the, first, second, of, a, breath, and, the, forced, vital, capacity, fvc, which, is, the, greatest, volume, of, air, that, can, be, breathed, out, in, a, single, large, breath, normally, 75, 80, of, the, fvc, comes, out, in, the, first, second, and, a, fev1, fvc, ratio, less, than, 70, in, someone, with, symptoms, of, copd, defines, a, person, as, having, the, disease, based, on, these, measurements, spirometry, would, lead, to, over, diagnosis, of, copd, in, the, elderly, the, national, institute, for, health, and, care, excellence, criteria, additionally, require, a, fev1, less, than, 80, of, predicted, people, with, copd, also, exhibit, a, decrease, in, diffusing, capacity, of, the, lung, for, carbon, monoxide, due, to, decreased, surface, area, in, the, alveoli, as, well, as, damage, to, the, capillary, bed, testing, the, peak, expiratory, flow, the, maximum, speed, of, expiration, commonly, used, in, asthma, diagnosis, is, not, sufficient, for, the, diagnosis, of, copd, screening, using, spirometry, in, those, without, symptoms, has, uncertain, effect, and, is, generally, not, recommended, however, it, is, recommended, for, those, without, symptoms, but, with, a, known, risk, factor, a, number, of, methods, can, be, used, to, assess, the, affects, and, severity, of, copd, the, mrc, breathlessness, scale, or, the, copd, assessment, test, cat, are, simple, questionnaires, that, may, be, used, gold, refers, to, a, modified, mrc, scale, that, if, used, needs, to, include, other, tests, since, it, is, simply, a, test, of, breathlessness, experienced, scores, on, cat, range, from, 0, 40, with, the, higher, the, score, the, more, severe, the, disease, spirometry, may, help, to, determine, the, severity, of, airflow, limitation, this, is, typically, based, on, the, fev1, expressed, as, a, percentage, of, the, predicted, normal, for, the, person, s, age, gender, height, and, weight, guidelines, published, in, 2011, by, american, and, european, medical, societies, recommend, partly, basing, treatment, recommendations, on, the, fev1, the, gold, guidelines, group, people, into, four, categories, based, on, symptoms, assessment, degree, of, airflow, limitation, and, history, of, exacerbations, weight, loss, muscle, loss, and, fatigue, are, seen, in, severe, and, very, severe, cases, use, of, screening, questionnaires, such, as, copd, diagnostic, questionnaire, cdq, alone, or, in, combination, with, hand, held, flow, meters, is, appropriate, for, screening, of, copd, in, primary, care, a, chest, x, ray, is, not, useful, to, establish, a, diagnosis, of, copd, but, it, is, of, use, in, either, excluding, other, conditions, or, including, comorbidities, such, as, pulmonary, fibrosis, and, bronchiectasis, characteristic, signs, of, copd, on, x, ray, include, hyperinflation, shown, by, a, flattened, diaphragm, and, an, increased, retrosternal, air, space, and, lung, hyperlucency, a, saber, sheath, trachea, may, also, be, shown, that, is, indicative, of, copd, a, ct, scan, is, not, routinely, used, except, for, the, exclusion, of, bronchiectasis, an, analysis, of, arterial, blood, is, used, to, determine, the, need, for, oxygen, supplementation, and, assess, for, high, levels, of, carbon, dioxide, in, the, blood, this, is, recommended, in, those, with, an, fev1, less, than, 35, predicted, those, with, a, peripheral, oxygen, saturation, less, than, 92, and, those, with, symptoms, of, congestive, heart, failure, who, recommends, that, all, those, diagnosed, with, copd, be, screened, for, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, deficiency, copd, may, need, to, be, differentiated, from, other, conditions, such, as, congestive, heart, failure, asthma, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, obliterative, bronchiolitis, and, diffuse, panbronchiolitis, the, distinction, between, asthma, and, copd, is, made, on, the, basis, of, the, symptoms, smoking, history, and, whether, airflow, limitation, is, reversible, with, bronchodilators, at, spirometry, chronic, bronchitis, with, normal, airflow, is, not, classified, as, copd, most, cases, of, copd, are, potentially, preventable, through, decreasing, exposure, to, tobacco, smoke, and, other, indoor, and, outdoor, pollutants, the, policies, of, governments, public, health, agencies, and, antismoking, organizations, can, reduce, smoking, rates, by, discouraging, people, from, starting, and, encouraging, people, to, stop, smoking, smoking, bans, in, public, areas, and, places, of, work, are, important, measures, to, decrease, exposure, to, secondhand, smoke, and, while, many, places, have, instituted, bans, more, are, recommended, in, those, who, smoke, stopping, smoking, is, the, only, measure, shown, to, slow, down, the, worsening, of, copd, even, at, a, late, stage, of, the, disease, it, can, reduce, the, rate, of, worsening, lung, function, and, delay, the, onset, of, disability, and, death, often, several, attempts, are, required, before, long, term, abstinence, is, achieved, attempts, over, 5, years, lead, to, success, in, nearly, 40, of, people, some, smokers, can, achieve, long, term, smoking, cessation, through, willpower, alone, smoking, however, is, highly, addictive, and, many, smokers, need, further, support, the, chance, of, quitting, is, improved, with, social, support, engagement, in, a, smoking, cessation, program, and, the, use, of, medications, such, as, nicotine, replacement, therapy, bupropion, or, varenicline, combining, smoking, cessation, medication, with, behavioral, therapy, is, more, than, twice, as, likely, to, be, effective, in, helping, people, with, copd, stop, smoking, compared, with, behavioral, therapy, alone, a, number, of, measures, have, been, taken, to, reduce, the, likelihood, that, workers, in, at, risk, industries, such, as, coal, mining, construction, and, stonemasonry, will, develop, copd, examples, of, these, measures, include, the, creation, of, public, policy, education, of, workers, and, management, about, the, risks, promoting, smoking, cessation, checking, workers, for, early, signs, of, copd, use, of, respirators, and, dust, control, effective, dust, control, can, be, achieved, by, improving, ventilation, using, water, sprays, and, by, using, mining, techniques, that, minimize, dust, generation, if, a, worker, develops, copd, further, lung, damage, can, be, reduced, by, avoiding, ongoing, dust, exposure, for, example, by, changing, their, work, role, both, indoor, and, outdoor, air, quality, can, be, improved, which, may, prevent, copd, or, slow, the, worsening, of, existing, disease, this, may, be, achieved, by, public, policy, efforts, cultural, changes, and, personal, involvement, many, developed, countries, have, successfully, improved, outdoor, air, quality, through, regulations, which, has, resulted, in, improvements, in, the, lung, function, of, their, populations, individuals, are, also, advised, to, avoid, irritants, of, indoor, and, outdoor, pollution, in, developing, countries, one, key, effort, is, to, reduce, exposure, to, smoke, from, cooking, and, heating, fuels, through, improved, ventilation, of, homes, and, better, stoves, and, chimneys, proper, stoves, may, improve, indoor, air, quality, by, 85, using, alternative, energy, sources, such, as, solar, cooking, and, electrical, heating, is, also, effective, using, fuels, such, as, kerosene, or, coal, might, produce, less, household, particulate, matter, than, traditional, biomass, such, as, wood, or, dung, but, whether, this, is, better, health, wise, is, unclear, copd, currently, has, no, cure, but, the, symptoms, are, treatable, and, its, progression, can, be, delayed, particularly, by, stopping, smoking, the, major, goals, of, management, are, to, reduce, exposure, to, risk, factors, including, offering, non, pharmacological, treatments, such, as, help, with, stopping, smoking, stopping, smoking, can, reduce, the, rate, of, lung, function, decline, and, also, reduce, mortality, from, smoking, related, diseases, such, as, lung, cancer, and, cardiovascular, disease, other, recommendations, include, annual, influenza, vaccinations, and, pneumococcal, vaccination, to, help, reduce, the, risk, of, exacerbations, cdc, and, gold, 2024, also, recommends, rsv, vaccine, for, individuals, above, 60, years, giving, advice, as, to, healthy, eating, and, encouraging, physical, exercise,

its, own, which, type, of, long, acting, agent, long, acting, muscarinic, antagonist, lama, such, as, tiotropium, or, long, acting, beta, agonist, laba, is, better, is, unclear, and, trying, each, and, continuing, with, the, one, that, works, best, may, be, advisable, both, types, of, agent, appear, to, reduce, the, risk, of, acute, exacerbations, by, 15, 25, the, combination, of, laba, lama, may, reduce, copd, exacerbations, and, improve, quality, of, life, compared, to, long, acting, bronchodilators, alone, the, 2018, nice, guideline, recommends, use, of, dual, long, acting,

there, are, a, number, of, procedures, to, reduce, the, volume, of, a, lung, in, cases, of, severe, emphysema, with, hyperinflation, for, severe, emphysema, that, has, proved, unresponsive, to, other, therapies, lung, volume, reduction, surgery, lvrs, may, be, an, option, lvrs, involves, the, removal, of, damaged, tissue, which, improves, lung, function, by, allowing, the, rest, of, the, lungs, to, expand, it, is, considered, when, the, emphysema, is, in, the, upper, lobes, and, when, there, are, no, comorbidities, minimally, invasive, bronchoscopic, procedures, may, be, carried, out, to, reduce, lung, volume, these, include, the, use, of, valves, coils, or, thermal, ablation, endobronchial, valves, are, one, way, valves, that, may, be, used, in, those, with, severe, hyperinflation, resulting, from, advanced, emphysema, a, suitable, target, lobe, and, no, collateral, ventilation, are, required, for, this, procedure, the, placement, of, one, or, more, valves, in, the, lobe, induces, a, partial, collapse, of, the, lobe, that, ensures, a, reduction, in, residual, volume, that, improves, lung, function, the, capacity, for, exercise, and, quality, of, life, the, placement, of, nitinol, coils, instead, of, valves, is, recommended, where, there, is, collateral, ventilation, that, would, prevent, the, use, of, valves, nitinol, is, a, biocompatible, alloy, both, of, these, techniques, are, associated, with, adverse, effects, including, persistent, air, leaks, and, cardiovascular, complications, thermal, vapor, ablation, has, an, improved, profile, heated, water, vapor, is, used, to, target, lobe, regions, which, leads, to, permanent, fibrosis, and, volume, reduction, the, procedure, is, able, to, target, individual, lobe, segments, can, be, carried, out, regardless, of, collateral, ventilation, and, can, be, repeated, with, the, natural, advance, of, emphysema, in, very, severe, cases, lung, transplantation, might, be, considered, a, ct, scan, may, be, useful, in, surgery, considerations, ventilation, perfusion, scintigraphy, is, another, imaging, method, that, may, be, used, to, evaluate, cases, for, surgical, interventions, and, also, to, evaluate, post, surgery, responses, a, bullectomy, may, be, carried, out, when, a, giant, bulla, occupies, more, than, a, third, of, a, hemithorax, copd, is, progressive, and, can, lead, to, premature, death, it, is, estimated, that, 3, of, all, disability, is, related, to, copd, the, proportion, of, disability, from, copd, globally, has, decreased, from, 1990, to, 2010, due, to, improved, indoor, air, quality, primarily, in, asia, the, overall, number, of, years, lived, with, disability, from, copd, however, has, increased, there, are, many, variables, affecting, the, long, term, outcome, in, copd, and, gold, recommends, the, use, of, a, composite, test, bode, that, includes, the, main, variables, of, body, mass, index, obstruction, of, airways, dyspnea, breathlessness, and, exercise, and, not, just, spirometry, results, nice, recommends, against, the, use, of, bode, for, the, prognosis, assessment, in, stable, copd, factors, such, as, exacerbations, and, frailty, need, to, be, considered, other, factors, that, contribute, to, a, poor, outcome, include, older, age, comorbidities, such, as, lung, cancer, and, cardiovascular, disease, and, the, number, and, severity, of, exacerbations, needing, hospital, admittance, estimates, of, prevalence, have, considerable, variation, due, to, differences, in, analytical, and, surveying, approach, and, the, choice, of, diagnostic, criteria, an, estimated, 384, million, people, aged, 30, years, or, more, had, copd, in, 2010, corresponding, to, a, global, prevalence, of, 12, the, disease, affects, men, and, women, the, increase, in, the, developing, world, between, 1970, and, the, 2000s, is, believed, to, be, related, to, increasing, rates, of, smoking, in, this, region, an, increasing, population, and, an, aging, population, due, to, fewer, deaths, from, other, causes, such, as, infectious, diseases, some, developed, countries, have, seen, increased, rates, some, have, remained, stable, and, some, have, seen, a, decrease, in, copd, prevalence, around, three, million, people, die, of, copd, each, year, in, some, countries, mortality, has, decreased, in, men, but, increased, in, women, this, is, most, likely, due, to, rates, of, smoking, in, women, and, men, becoming, more, similar, a, higher, rate, of, copd, is, found, in, those, over, 40, years, and, this, increases, greatly, with, advancing, age, with, the, highest, rate, found, in, those, over, 60, years, sex, differences, in, the, anatomy, of, the, respiratory, system, include, smaller, airway, lumens, and, thicker, airway, walls, in, women, which, contribute, to, a, greater, severity, of, copd, symptoms, like, dyspnea, and, frequency, of, copd, exacerbation, in, the, uk, three, million, people, are, reported, to, be, affected, by, copd, two, million, of, these, being, undiagnosed, on, average, the, number, of, copd, related, deaths, between, 2007, and, 2016, was, 28, 600, the, estimated, number, of, deaths, due, to, occupational, exposure, was, estimated, to, be, about, 15, at, around, 4, 000, in, the, united, states, in, 2018, almost, 15, 7, million, people, had, been, diagnosed, with, copd, and, it, is, estimated, that, millions, more, have, not, been, diagnosed, in, 2011, there, were, approximately, 730, 000, hospitalizations, in, the, united, states, for, copd, globally, copd, in, 2019, was, the, third, leading, cause, of, death, in, low, income, countries, copd, does, not, appear, in, the, top, 10, causes, of, death, in, other, income, groups, it, is, in, the, top, 5, the, name, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, is, believed, to, have, first, been, used, in, 1965, previously, it, has, been, known, by, a, number, of, different, names, including, chronic, obstructive, bronchopulmonary, disease, chronic, airflow, obstruction, chronic, obstructive, lung, disease, nonspecific, chronic, pulmonary, disease, diffuse, obstructive, pulmonary, syndrome, the, terms, emphysema, and, chronic, bronchitis, were, formally, defined, as, components, of, copd, in, 1959, at, the, ciba, guest, symposium, and, in, 1962, at, the, american, thoracic, society, committee, meeting, on, diagnostic, standards, early, descriptions, of, probable, emphysema, began, in, 1679, by, t, bonet, of, a, condition, of, voluminous, lungs, and, in, 1769, by, giovanni, morgagni, of, lungs, which, were, turgid, particularly, from, air, in, 1721, the, first, drawings, of, emphysema, were, made, by, ruysh, ren, laennec, used, the, term, emphysema, in, his, book, a, treatise, on, the, diseases, of, the, chest, and, of, mediate, auscultation, 1837, to, describe, lungs, that, did, not, collapse, when, he, opened, the, chest, during, an, autopsy, he, noted, that, they, did, not, collapse, as, usual, because, they, were, full, of, air, and, the, airways, were, filled, with, mucus, in, 1842, john, hutchinson, invented, the, spirometer, which, allowed, the, measurement, of, vital, capacity, of, the, lungs, however, his, spirometer, could, only, measure, volume, not, airflow, tiffeneau, and, pinelli, in, 1947, described, the, principles, of, measuring, airflow, air, pollution, and, the, increase, in, cigarette, smoking, in, great, britain, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, led, to, high, rates, of, chronic, lung, disease, though, it, received, little, attention, until, the, great, smog, of, london, in, december, 1952, this, spurred, epidemiological, research, in, the, united, kingdom, holland, and, elsewhere, in, 1953, george, l, waldbott, an, american, allergist, first, described, a, new, disease, he, named, smoker, s, respiratory, syndrome, in, the, 1953, journal, of, the, american, medical, association, this, was, the, first, association, between, tobacco, smoking, and, chronic, respiratory, disease, modern, treatments, were, developed, during, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, evidence, supporting, the, use, of, steroids, in, copd, was, published, in, the, late, 1950s, bronchodilators, came, into, use, in, the, 1960s, following, a, promising, trial, of, isoprenaline, further, bronchodilators, such, as, short, acting, salbutamol, were, developed, in, the, 1970s, and, the, use, of, long, acting, bronchodilators, began, in, the, mid, 1990s, it, is, generally, accepted, that, copd, is, widely, underdiagnosed, and, many, people, remain, untreated, in, the, us, the, nih, has, promoted, november, as, copd, awareness, month, to, be, an, annual, focus, on, increasing, awareness, of, the, condition, globally, as, of, 2010, copd, is, estimated, to, result, in, economic, costs, of, 2, 1, trillion, half, of, which, occurring, in, the, developing, world, of, this, total, an, estimated, 1, 9, trillion, are, direct, costs, such, as, medical, care, while, 0, 2, trillion, are, indirect, costs, such, as, missed, work, this, is, expected, to, more, than, double, by, 2030, in, europe, copd, represents, 3, of, healthcare, spending, in, the, united, states, costs, of, the, disease, are, estimated, at, 50, billion, most, of, which, is, due, to, exacerbation, copd, was, among, the, most, expensive, conditions, seen, in, u, s, hospitals, in, 2011, with, a, total, cost, of, about, 5, 7, billion, hyaluronan, is, a, natural, sugar, in, the, extracellular, matrix, that, provides, a, protective, coating, for, cells, it, has, been, shown, that, on, exposure, to, pollution, the, hyaluronan, in, the, lungs, breaks, down, into, fragments, causing, irritation, and, activation, of, the, immune, system, there, follows, subsequent, airway, constriction, and, inflammation, the, study, showed, that, the, inhalation, of, unfragmented, hyaluronan, overcame, the, effects, of, fragmented, ha, and, reduced, inflammation, inhaled, ha, only, acts, locally, in, the, bronchial, tree, and, does, not, interfere, with, any, drug, it, improves, mucus, clearance, by, allowing, it, to, move, more, freely, further, studies, are, to, be, carried, out, in, the, us, to, determine, optimum, dosage, levels, a, new, cryogenic, treatment, aimed, at, the, chronic, bronchitic, subtype, using, a, liquid, nitrogen, metered, cryospray, is, being, trialed, and, was, due, to, complete, in, september, 2021, stem, cell, therapy, using, mesenchymal, stem, cells, has, the, potential, to, restore, lung, function, and, thereby, improve, quality, of, life, in, june, 2021, eight, clinical, trials, had, been, completed, and, seventeen, were, underway, overall, stem, cell, therapy, has, proved, to, be, safe, the, trials, include, the, use, of, stem, cells, from, different, sources, such, as, adipose, tissue, bone, marrow, and, umbilical, cord, blood, a, procedure, known, as, targeted, lung, denervation, is, being, trialed, and, has, been, used, as, part, of, a, clinical, trial, 2021, in, a, hospital, in, the, uk, the, new, minimally, invasive, procedure, which, takes, about, an, hour, to, carry, out, places, electrodes, to, destroy, branches, of, the, vagus, nerve, in, the, lungs, the, vagus, nerve, is, responsible, for, both, muscle, contraction, and, mucus, secretion, which, results, in, narrowing, the, airways, in, those, with, copd, these, nerves, are, overactive, usually, as, a, result, of, smoking, damage, and, the, constant, mucus, secretion, and, airway, constriction, leads, to, the, symptoms, of, cough, shortness, of, breath, wheeze, and, tightness, of, the, chest, the, effectiveness, of, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, augmentation, treatment, for, people, who, have, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, deficiency, is, unclear, a, later, clinical, trial, of, double, dosing, has, shown, some, improvements, in, slowing, the, breakdown, of, elastin, and, the, progression, of, emphysema, with, further, studies, being, called, for, mass, spectrometry, is, being, studied, as, a, diagnostic, tool, in, copd, research, continues, into, the, use, of, telehealthcare, to, treat, people, with, copd, when, they, experience, episodes, of, shortness, of, breath, treating, people, remotely, may, reduce, the, number, of, emergency, room, visits, and, improve, the, person, s, quality, of, life, evidence, is, growing, for, the, effectiveness, of, astaxanthin, against, lung, disease, including, copd, astaxanthin, is, a, potent, antioxidant, with, anti, inflammatory, properties, and, more, trials, are, said, to, be, needed, into, its, use, american, copd, patients, and, their, caregivers, consider, the, following, copd, related, research, areas, as, the, most, important, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, may, occur, in, a, number, of, other, animals, and, may, be, caused, by, exposure, to, tobacco, smoke, most, cases, of, the, disease, however, are, relatively, mild, in, horses, it, is, known, as, recurrent, airway, obstruction, rao, or, heaves, rao, can, be, quite, severe, and, most, often, is, linked, to, exposure, to, common, allergens, copd, is, also, commonly, found, in, old, dogs
