are, great, apes, native, to, the, rainforests, of, indonesia, and, malaysia, they, are, now, found, only, in, parts, of, borneo, and, sumatra, but, during, the, pleistocene, they, ranged, throughout, southeast, asia, and, south, china, classified, in, the, genus, pongo, orangutans, were, originally, considered, to, be, one, species, from, 1996, they, were, divided, into, two, species, the, bornean, orangutan, p, pygmaeus, with, three, subspecies, and, the, sumatran, orangutan, p, abelii, a, third, species, the, tapanuli, orangutan, p, tapanuliensis, was, identified, definitively, in, 2017, the, orangutans, are, the, only, surviving, species, of, the, subfamily, ponginae, which, diverged, genetically, from, the, other, hominids, gorillas, chimpanzees, and, humans, between, 19, 3, and, 15, 7, million, years, ago, the, most, arboreal, of, the, great, apes, orangutans, spend, most, of, their, time, in, trees, they, have, proportionally, long, arms, and, short, legs, and, have, reddish, brown, hair, covering, their, bodies, adult, males, weigh, about, 75, kg, 165, lb, while, females, reach, about, 37, kg, 82, lb, dominant, adult, males, develop, distinctive, cheek, pads, or, flanges, and, make, long, calls, that, attract, females, and, intimidate, rivals, younger, subordinate, males, do, not, and, more, resemble, adult, females, orangutans, are, the, most, solitary, of, the, great, apes, social, bonds, occur, primarily, between, mothers, and, their, dependent, offspring, fruit, is, the, most, important, component, of, an, orangutan, s, diet, but, they, will, also, eat, vegetation, bark, honey, insects, and, bird, eggs, they, can, live, over, 30, years, both, in, the, wild, and, in, captivity, orangutans, are, among, the, most, intelligent, primates, they, use, a, variety, of, sophisticated, tools, and, construct, elaborate, sleeping, nests, each, night, from, branches, and, foliage, the, apes, learning, abilities, have, been, studied, extensively, there, may, be, distinctive, cultures, within, populations, orangutans, have, been, featured, in, literature, and, art, since, at, least, the, 18th, century, particularly, in, works, that, comment, on, human, society, field, studies, of, the, apes, were, pioneered, by, primatologist, birut, galdikas, and, they, have, been, kept, in, captive, facilities, around, the, world, since, at, least, the, early, 19th, century, all, three, orangutan, species, are, considered, critically, endangered, human, activities, have, caused, severe, declines, in, populations, and, ranges, threats, to, wild, orangutan, populations, include, poaching, for, bushmeat, and, retaliation, for, consuming, crops, habitat, destruction, and, deforestation, for, palm, oil, cultivation, and, logging, and, the, illegal, pet, trade, several, conservation, and, rehabilitation, organisations, are, dedicated, to, the, survival, of, orangutans, in, the, wild, the, name, orangutan, also, written, orang, utan, orang, utan, orangutang, and, ourang, outang, is, derived, from, the, malay, words, orang, meaning, person, and, hutan, meaning, forest, the, locals, originally, used, the, term, for, actual, forest, dwelling, humans, but, the, word, underwent, a, semantic, extension, to, include, apes, of, the, pongo, genus, at, an, early, stage, in, the, development, of, malay, the, word, orangutan, appears, in, its, older, form, urangutan, in, a, variety, of, premodern, sources, in, the, old, javanese, language, the, earliest, of, these, is, the, kakawin, ramayana, a, ninth, or, early, tenth, century, javanese, adaption, of, the, sanskrit, ramayana, in, these, old, javanese, texts, the, word, urangutan, refers, only, to, the, apes, and, not, forest, dwelling, humans, the, word, is, not, originally, javanese, but, was, borrowed, from, an, early, malayic, language, at, least, a, thousand, years, ago, hence, the, ultimate, origin, of, the, term, orangutan, as, denoting, the, pongo, ape, was, most, likely, old, malay, in, western, sources, the, first, printed, attestation, of, the, word, for, the, apes, is, in, dutch, physician, jacobus, bontius, 1631, historiae, naturalis, et, medicae, indiae, orientalis, he, reported, that, malays, claimed, the, ape, could, talk, but, preferred, not, to, lest, he, be, compelled, to, labour, the, word, appeared, in, several, german, language, descriptions, of, indonesian, zoology, in, the, 17th, century, it, has, been, argued, that, the, word, comes, specifically, from, the, banjarese, variety, of, malay, but, the, age, of, the, old, javanese, sources, mentioned, above, make, old, malay, a, more, likely, origin, for, the, term, cribb, and, colleagues, 2014, suggest, that, bontius, account, referred, not, to, apes, as, this, description, was, from, java, where, the, apes, were, not, known, to, be, from, but, to, humans, suffering, some, serious, medical, condition, most, likely, cretinism, and, that, his, use, of, the, word, was, misunderstood, by, nicolaes, tulp, who, was, the, first, to, use, the, term, in, a, publication, a, decade, later, 10, 18, the, word, was, first, attested, in, english, in, 1693, by, physician, john, bulwer, in, the, form, orang, outang, and, variants, ending, with, ng, are, found, in, many, languages, this, spelling, and, pronunciation, has, remained, in, use, in, english, up, to, the, present, but, has, come, to, be, regarded, as, incorrect, the, loss, of, h, in, hutan, and, the, shift, from, ng, to, n, has, been, taken, to, suggest, the, term, entered, english, through, portuguese, in, malay, the, term, was, first, attested, in, 1840, not, as, an, indigenous, name, but, referring, to, how, the, english, called, the, animal, the, word, orangutan, in, modern, malay, and, indonesian, was, borrowed, from, english, or, dutch, in, the, 20th, century, explaining, the, missing, initial, h, of, hutan, the, name, of, the, genus, pongo, comes, from, a, 16th, century, account, by, andrew, battel, an, english, sailor, held, prisoner, by, the, portuguese, in, angola, which, describes, two, anthropoid, monsters, named, pongo, and, engeco, he, is, now, believed, to, have, been, describing, gorillas, but, in, the, 18th, century, the, terms, orangutan, and, pongo, were, used, for, all, great, apes, french, naturalist, bernard, germain, de, lac, p, de, used, the, term, pongo, for, the, genus, in, 1799, 24, 25, battel, s, pongo, in, turn, is, from, the, kongo, word, mpongi, or, other, cognates, from, the, region, lumbu, pungu, vili, mpungu, or, yombi, yimpungu, the, orangutan, was, first, described, scientifically, in, 1758, in, the, systema, naturae, of, carl, linnaeus, as, homo, troglodytes, 20, it, was, renamed, simia, pygmaeus, in, 1760, by, his, student, christian, emmanuel, hopp, and, given, the, name, pongo, by, lac, p, de, in, 1799, 24, 25, the, populations, on, the, two, islands, were, suggested, to, be, separate, species, when, p, abelii, was, described, by, french, naturalist, ren, lesson, in, 1827, in, 2001, p, abelii, was, confirmed, as, a, full, species, based, on, molecular, evidence, published, in, 1996, 53, and, three, distinct, populations, on, borneo, were, elevated, to, subspecies, p, p, pygmaeus, p, p, morio, and, p, p, wurmbii, the, description, in, 2017, of, a, third, species, p, tapanuliensis, from, sumatra, south, of, lake, toba, came, with, a, surprising, twist, it, is, more, closely, related, to, the, bornean, species, p, pygmaeus, than, to, its, fellow, sumatran, species, p, abelii, the, sumatran, orangutan, genome, was, sequenced, in, january, 2011, following, humans, and, chimpanzees, the, sumatran, orangutan, became, the, third, species, of, great, ape, to, have, its, genome, sequenced, subsequently, the, bornean, species, had, its, genome, sequenced, bornean, orangutans, p, pygmaeus, have, less, genetic, diversity, than, in, sumatran, ones, p, abelii, despite, populations, being, six, to, seven, times, higher, in, borneo, the, researchers, hope, these, data, may, help, conservationists, preserve, the, endangered, ape, as, well, as, learn, more, about, human, genetic, diseases, similarly, to, gorillas, and, chimpanzees, orangutans, have, 48, diploid, chromosomes, in, contrast, to, humans, which, have, 46, 30, according, to, molecular, evidence, within, apes, superfamily, hominoidea, the, gibbons, diverged, during, the, early, miocene, between, 24, 1, and, 19, 7, million, years, ago, mya, and, the, orangutans, diverged, from, the, african, great, ape, lineage, between, 19, 3, and, 15, 7, mya, israfil, and, colleagues, 2011, estimated, based, on, mitochondrial, y, linked, and, x, linked, loci, that, the, sumatran, and, bornean, species, diverged, 4, 9, to, 2, 9, mya, fig, 4, by, contrast, the, 2011, genome, study, suggested, that, these, two, species, diverged, as, recently, as, circa, 400, 000, years, ago, the, study, also, found, that, orangutans, evolved, at, a, slower, pace, than, both, chimpanzees, and, humans, a, 2017, genome, study, found, that, the, bornean, and, tapanuli, orangutans, diverged, from, sumatran, orangutans, about, 3, 4, mya, and, from, each, other, around, 2, 4, mya, millions, of, years, ago, orangutans, travelled, from, mainland, asia, to, sumatra, and, then, borneo, as, the, islands, were, connected, by, land, bridges, during, the, recent, glacial, periods, when, sea, levels, were, much, lower, the, present, range, of, tapanuli, orangutans, is, thought, to, be, close, to, where, ancestral, orangutans, first, entered, what, is, now, indonesia, from, mainland, asia, gibbons, family, hylobatidae, orangutans, genus, pongo, gorillas, genus, gorilla, chimpanzees, genus, pan, humans, genus, homo, the, three, orangutan, species, are, the, only, extant, members, of, the, subfamily, ponginae, this, subfamily, also, includes, extinct, apes, such, as, lufengpithecus, which, occurred, 8, 2, mya, in, southern, china, and, thailand, 50, indopithecus, which, lived, in, india, from, 9, 2, to, 8, 6, mya, and, sivapithecus, which, lived, in, india, and, pakistan, from, 12, 5, mya, until, 8, 5, mya, these, animals, likely, lived, in, drier, and, cooler, environments, than, orangutans, do, today, khoratpithecus, piriyai, which, lived, 5, 7, mya, in, thailand, is, believed, to, be, the, closest, known, relative, of, the, living, orangutans, and, inhabited, similar, environments, 50, the, largest, known, primate, gigantopithecus, was, also, a, member, of, ponginae, and, lived, in, china, from, 2, mya, to, 300, 000, years, ago, 50, the, oldest, known, record, of, pongo, is, from, the, early, pleistocene, of, chongzuo, consisting, of, teeth, ascribed, to, extinct, species, p, weidenreichi, pongo, is, found, as, part, of, the, faunal, complex, in, the, pleistocene, cave, assemblage, in, vietnam, alongside, giganopithecus, though, it, is, known, only, from, teeth, some, fossils, described, under, the, name, p, hooijeri, have, been, found, in, vietnam, and, multiple, fossil, subspecies, have, been, described, from, several, parts, of, southeastern, asia, it, is, unclear, if, these, belong, to, p, pygmaeus, or, p, abelii, or, in, fact, represent, distinct, species, during, the, pleistocene, pongo, had, a, far, more, extensive, range, than, at, present, extending, throughout, sundaland, and, mainland, southeast, asia, and, south, china, teeth, of, orangutans, are, known, from, peninsular, malaysia, that, date, to, 60, 000, years, ago, the, youngest, remains, from, south, china, which, are, teeth, assigned, to, p, weidenreichi, date, to, between, 66, and, 57, 000, years, ago, the, range, of, orangutans, had, contracted, significantly, by, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, most, likely, because, of, the, reduction, of, forest, habitat, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, though, they, may, have, survived, into, the, holocene, in, cambodia, and, vietnam, orangutans, display, significant, sexual, dimorphism, females, typically, stand, 115, cm, 45, in, tall, and, weigh, around, 37, kg, 82, lb, while, adult, males, stand, 137, cm, 54, in, tall, and, weigh, 75, kg, 165, lb, compared, to, humans, they, have, proportionally, long, arms, a, male, orangutan, having, an, arm, span, of, about, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, and, short, legs, they, are, covered, in, long, reddish, hair, that, starts, out, bright, orange, and, darkens, to, maroon, or, chocolate, with, age, while, the, skin, is, grey, black, though, largely, hairless, males, faces, can, develop, some, hair, giving, them, a, beard, 13, 15, orangutans, have, small, ears, and, noses, the, ears, are, unlobed, the, mean, endocranial, volume, is, 397, cm, 3, the, cranium, is, elevated, relative, to, the, face, which, is, incurved, and, prognathous, compared, to, chimpanzees, and, gorillas, the, brow, ridge, of, an, orangutan, is, underdeveloped, females, and, juveniles, have, relatively, circular, skulls, and, thin, faces, while, mature, males, have, a, prominent, sagittal, crest, large, cheek, pads, or, flanges, extensive, throat, pouches, and, long, canines, 14, the, cheek, pads, are, made, mostly, of, fatty, tissue, and, are, supported, by, the, musculature, of, the, face, the, throat, pouches, act, as, resonance, chambers, for, making, long, calls, orangutan, hands, have, four, long, fingers, but, a, dramatically, shorter, opposable, thumb, for, a, strong, grip, on, branches, as, they, travel, high, in, the, trees, the, resting, configuration, of, the, fingers, is, curved, creating, a, suspensory, hook, grip, with, the, thumb, out, of, the, way, the, fingers, and, hands, can, grip, securely, around, objects, with, a, small, diameter, by, resting, the, tops, of, the, fingers, against, the, inside, of, the, palm, thus, creating, a, double, locked, grip, their, feet, have, four, long, toes, and, an, opposable, big, toe, giving, them, hand, like, dexterity, the, hip, joints, also, allow, for, their, legs, to, rotate, similarly, to, their, arms, and, shoulders, 15, orangutans, move, through, the, trees, by, both, vertical, climbing, and, suspension, compared, to, other, great, apes, they, infrequently, descend, to, the, ground, where, they, are, more, cumbersome, unlike, gorillas, and, chimpanzees, orangutans, are, not, true, knuckle, walkers, instead, bending, their, digits, and, walking, on, the, sides, of, their, hands, and, feet, compared, to, their, relatives, in, borneo, sumatran, orangutans, are, more, slender, with, paler, and, longer, hair, and, a, longer, face, tapanuli, orangutans, resemble, sumatran, orangutans, more, than, bornean, orangutans, in, body, build, and, hair, colour, they, have, shaggier, hair, smaller, skulls, and, flatter, faces, than, the, other, two, species, orangutans, are, mainly, arboreal, and, inhabit, tropical, rainforest, particularly, lowland, dipterocarp, and, old, secondary, forest, populations, are, more, concentrated, near, riverside, habitats, such, as, freshwater, and, peat, swamp, forest, while, drier, forests, away, from, the, flooded, areas, have, fewer, apes, population, density, also, decreases, at, higher, elevations, 92, orangutans, occasionally, enter, grasslands, cultivated, fields, gardens, young, secondary, forest, and, shallow, lakes, most, of, the, day, is, spent, feeding, resting, and, travelling, they, start, the, day, feeding, for, two, to, three, hours, in, the, morning, they, rest, during, midday, then, travel, in, the, late, afternoon, when, evening, arrives, they, prepare, their, nests, for, the, night, potential, predators, of, orangutans, include, tigers, clouded, leopards, and, wild, dogs, 91, the, most, common, orangutan, parasites, are, nematodes, of, the, genus, strongyloides, and, the, ciliate, balantidium, coli, among, strongyloides, the, species, s, fuelleborni, and, s, stercoralis, are, reported, in, young, individuals, orangutans, also, use, the, plant, species, dracaena, cantleyi, as, an, anti, inflammatory, balm, captive, animals, may, suffer, an, upper, respiratory, tract, disease, orangutans, are, primarily, fruit, eaters, which, can, take, up, 57, 80, of, their, foraging, time, even, during, times, of, scarcity, fruit, is, 16, of, their, feeding, time, fruits, with, soft, pulp, arils, or, seed, walls, are, consumed, the, most, particularly, figs, but, also, drupes, and, berries, 65, orangutans, are, thought, to, be, the, sole, fruit, disperser, for, some, plant, species, including, the, vine, species, strychnos, ignatii, which, contains, the, toxic, alkaloid, strychnine, orangutans, also, include, leaves, in, their, diet, which, take, up, 25, of, their, average, foraging, time, leaves, are, eaten, more, when, fruit, is, less, available, but, even, during, times, of, fruit, abundance, orangutans, will, eat, leaves, 11, 20, of, the, time, they, appear, to, depend, on, the, leaf, and, stem, material, of, borassodendron, borneensis, during, times, of, low, fruit, abundance, other, food, items, consumed, by, the, apes, include, bark, honey, bird, eggs, insects, and, small, vertebrates, including, slow, lorises, 65, 66, in, some, areas, orangutans, may, practise, geophagy, which, involves, consuming, soil, and, other, earth, substances, they, will, uproot, soil, from, the, ground, as, well, as, eat, shelter, tubes, from, tree, trunks, orangutans, also, visit, the, sides, of, cliffs, or, earth, depressions, for, their, mineral, licks, orangutans, may, eat, soils, for, their, anti, toxic, kaolin, minerals, since, their, diet, contains, toxic, tannins, and, phenolic, acids, 67, the, social, structure, of, the, orangutan, can, be, best, described, as, solitary, but, social, they, live, a, more, solitary, lifestyle, than, the, other, great, apes, bornean, orangutans, are, generally, more, solitary, than, sumatran, orangutans, most, social, bonds, occur, between, adult, females, and, their, dependent, and, weaned, offspring, resident, females, live, with, their, offspring, in, defined, home, ranges, that, overlap, with, those, of, other, adult, females, which, may, be, their, immediate, relatives, one, to, several, resident, female, home, ranges, are, encompassed, within, the, home, range, of, a, resident, male, who, is, their, main, mating, partner, interactions, between, adult, females, range, from, friendly, to, avoidance, to, antagonistic, flanged, males, are, hostile, to, both, other, flanged, males, and, unflanged, males, while, unflanged, males, are, more, peaceful, towards, each, other, orangutans, disperse, and, establish, their, home, ranges, by, age, 11, females, tend, to, live, near, their, birth, range, while, males, disperse, farther, but, may, still, visit, their, birth, range, within, their, larger, home, range, they, enter, a, transient, phase, which, lasts, until, a, male, can, challenge, and, displace, a, dominant, resident, male, from, his, home, range, both, resident, and, transient, orangutans, aggregate, on, large, fruiting, trees, to, feed, the, fruits, tend, to, be, abundant, so, competition, is, low, and, individuals, may, engage, in, social, interactions, orangutans, will, also, form, travelling, groups, with, members, moving, between, different, food, sources, they, are, often, consortships, between, an, adult, male, and, a, female, social, grooming, is, uncommon, among, orangutans, orangutans, communicate, with, various, vocals, and, sounds, males, will, make, long, calls, both, to, attract, females, and, to, advertise, themselves, to, other, males, these, calls, have, three, components, they, begin, with, grumbles, peak, with, pulses, and, end, with, bubbles, both, sexes, will, try, to, intimidate, conspecifics, with, a, series, of, low, frequency, noises, known, collectively, as, the, rolling, call, when, uncomfortable, an, orangutan, will, produce, a, kiss, squeak, which, involves, sucking, in, air, through, pursed, lips, mothers, produce, throatscrapes, to, keep, in, contact, with, their, offspring, infants, make, soft, hoots, when, distressed, when, building, a, nest, orangutans, will, produce, smacks, or, blow, raspberries, orangutan, calls, display, consonant, and, vowel, like, components, and, they, maintain, their, meaning, over, great, distances, mother, orangutans, and, offspring, also, use, several, different, gestures, and, expressions, such, as, beckoning, stomping, lower, lip, pushing, object, shaking, and, presenting, a, body, part, these, communicate, goals, such, as, acquire, object, climb, on, me, climb, on, you, climb, over, move, away, play, change, decrease, intensity, resume, play, and, stop, that, males, become, sexually, mature, at, around, age, 15, they, may, exhibit, arrested, development, by, not, developing, the, distinctive, cheek, pads, pronounced, throat, pouches, long, fur, or, long, calls, until, a, resident, dominant, male, is, absent, the, transformation, from, unflanged, to, flanged, can, occur, quickly, flanged, males, attract, females, in, oestrous, with, their, characteristic, long, calls, which, may, also, suppress, development, in, younger, males, 100, unflanged, males, wander, widely, in, search, of, oestrous, females, and, upon, finding, one, will, force, copulation, on, her, the, occurrence, of, which, is, unusually, high, among, mammals, females, prefer, to, mate, with, the, fitter, flanged, males, forming, pairs, with, them, and, benefiting, from, their, protection, non, ovulating, females, do, not, usually, resist, copulation, with, unflanged, males, as, the, chance, of, conception, is, low, homosexual, behaviour, has, been, recorded, in, the, context, of, both, affiliative, and, aggressive, interactions, unlike, females, of, other, non, human, great, ape, species, orangutans, do, not, exhibit, sexual, swellings, to, signal, fertility, a, female, first, gives, birth, around, 15, years, of, age, and, they, have, a, six, to, nine, year, interbirth, interval, the, longest, among, the, great, apes, gestation, is, around, nine, months, long, and, infants, are, born, at, a, weight, of, 1, 5, 2, kg, 3, 3, 4, 4, lb, 99, usually, only, a, single, infant, is, born, twins, are, a, rare, occurrence, unlike, many, other, primates, male, orangutans, do, not, seem, to, practise, infanticide, this, may, be, because, they, cannot, ensure, they, will, sire, a, female, s, next, offspring, because, she, does, not, immediately, begin, ovulating, again, after, her, infant, dies, there, is, evidence, that, females, with, offspring, under, six, years, old, generally, avoid, adult, males, females, do, most, of, the, caring, of, the, young, the, mother, will, carry, the, infant, while, travelling, suckle, it, and, sleep, with, it, 100, during, its, first, four, months, the, infant, is, almost, never, without, physical, contact, and, clings, to, its, mother, s, belly, in, the, following, months, the, amount, of, physical, contact, the, infant, has, with, its, mother, declines, when, an, orangutan, reaches, the, age, of, one, and, a, half, years, its, climbing, skills, improve, and, it, will, travel, through, the, canopy, holding, hands, with, other, orangutans, a, behaviour, known, as, buddy, travel, after, two, years, of, age, juvenile, orangutans, will, begin, to, move, away, from, their, mothers, temporarily, they, reach, adolescence, at, six, or, seven, years, of, age, and, are, able, to, live, alone, but, retain, some, connections, with, their, mothers, 100, females, may, nurse, their, offspring, for, up, to, eight, years, which, is, more, than, any, other, mammal, typically, orangutans, live, over, 30, years, both, in, the, wild, and, in, captivity, 15, orangutans, build, nests, specialised, for, either, day, or, night, use, these, are, carefully, constructed, young, orangutans, learn, from, observing, their, mother, s, nest, building, behaviour, in, fact, nest, building, allows, young, orangutans, to, become, less, dependent, on, their, mother, from, six, months, of, age, onwards, orangutans, practise, nest, building, and, gain, proficiency, by, the, time, they, are, three, years, old, construction, of, a, night, nest, is, done, by, following, a, sequence, of, steps, initially, a, suitable, tree, is, located, orangutans, are, choosy, about, sites, though, nests, can, be, found, in, many, tree, species, to, establish, a, foundation, the, ape, grabs, the, large, branches, under, it, and, bends, them, so, they, join, the, orangutan,

orangutans, play, games, a, 2008, study, of, two, orangutans, at, the, leipzig, zoo, showed, orangutans, may, practise, calculated, reciprocity, which, involves, an, individual, aiding, another, with, the, expectation, of, being, paid, back, orangutans, are, the, first, nonhuman, species, documented, to, do, so, in, a, 1997, study, two, captive, adult, orangutans, were, tested, with, the, cooperative, pulling, paradigm, without, any, training, the, orangutans, succeeded, in, pulling, off, an, object, to, get, food, in, the, first, session, over, the, course, of, 30, sessions, the, apes, succeeded, more, quickly, having, learned, to, coordinate, an, adult, orangutan, has, been, documented, to, pass, the, mirror, test, indicating, self, awareness, mirror, tests, with, a, 2, year, old, orangutan, failed, to, reveal, self, recognition, studies, in, the, wild, indicate, that, flanged, male, orangutans, plan, their, movements, in, advance, and, signal, them, to, other, individuals, experiments, have, also, suggested, that, orangutans, can, communicate, about, things, that, are, not, present, mother, orangutans, remain, silent, in, the, presence, of, a, perceived, threat, but, when, it, passes, the, mother, produces, an, alarm, call, to, their, offspring, to, teach, them, about, the, danger, orangutans, and, other, great, apes, show, laughter, like, vocalisations, in, response, to, physical, contact, such, as, wrestling, play, chasing, or, tickling, this, suggests, that, laughter, derived, from, a, common, origin, among, primate, species, and, therefore, evolved, before, the, origin, of, humans, orangutans, can, learn, to, mimic, new, sounds, by, purposely, controlling, the, vibrations, of, their, vocal, folds, a, trait, that, led, to, speech, in, humans, bonnie, an, orangutan, at, the, us, national, zoo, was, recorded, spontaneously, whistling, after, hearing, a, caretaker, she, appears, to, whistle, without, expecting, a, food, reward, tool, use, in, orangutans, was, observed, by, primatologist, birut, galdikas, in, ex, captive, populations, orangutans, in, suaq, balimbing, were, recorded, to, develop, a, tool, kit, for, use, in, foraging, which, consisted, of, both, insect, extraction, sticks, for, use, in, the, hollows, of, trees, and, seed, extraction, sticks, for, harvesting, seeds, from, hard, husked, fruit, the, orangutans, adjusted, their, tools, according, to, the, task, at, hand, and, preference, was, given, to, oral, tool, use, this, preference, was, also, found, in, an, experimental, study, of, captive, orangutans, orangutans, have, been, observed, to, use, sticks, to, poke, at, catfish, causing, them, to, leap, out, of, the, water, so, the, orangutan, can, grab, them, orangutan, have, also, been, documented, to, keep, tools, for, later, when, building, a, nest, orangutans, appear, to, be, able, to, determine, which, branches, would, better, support, their, body, weight, primatologist, carel, p, van, schaik, and, biological, anthropologist, cheryl, d, knott, further, investigated, tool, use, in, different, wild, orangutan, populations, they, compared, geographic, variations, in, tool, use, related, to, the, processing, of, neesia, fruit, the, orangutans, of, suaq, balimbing, were, found, to, be, avid, users, of, insect, and, seed, extraction, tools, when, compared, to, other, wild, orangutans, the, scientists, suggested, these, differences, are, cultural, as, they, do, not, correlate, with, habitat, the, orangutans, at, suaq, balimbing, are, closely, spaced, and, relatively, tolerant, of, each, other, this, creates, favourable, conditions, for, the, spreading, of, new, behaviours, further, evidence, that, highly, social, orangutans, are, more, likely, to, exhibit, cultural, behaviours, came, from, a, study, of, leaf, carrying, behaviours, of, formerly, captive, orangutans, that, were, being, rehabilitated, on, the, island, of, kaja, in, borneo, wild, orangutans, in, tuanan, borneo, were, reported, to, use, tools, in, acoustic, communication, they, use, leaves, to, amplify, the, kiss, squeak, sounds, they, produce, the, apes, may, employ, this, method, of, amplification, to, deceive, the, listener, into, believing, they, are, larger, animals, in, 2003, researchers, from, six, different, orangutan, field, sites, who, used, the, same, behavioural, coding, scheme, compared, the, behaviours, of, the, animals, from, each, site, they, found, each, orangutan, population, used, different, tools, the, evidence, suggested, the, differences, were, cultural, first, the, extent, of, the, differences, increased, with, distance, suggesting, cultural, diffusion, was, occurring, and, second, the, size, of, the, orangutans, cultural, repertoire, increased, according, to, the, amount, of, social, contact, present, within, the, group, social, contact, facilitates, cultural, transmission, during, a, field, observation, in, 2022, a, male, sumatran, orangutan, known, to, researchers, as, rakus, chewed, fibraurea, tinctoria, vine, leaves, and, applied, the, mashed, plant, material, to, an, open, wound, on, his, face, according, to, primatologists, who, had, been, observing, rakus, at, a, nature, preserve, five, days, later, the, facial, wound, was, closed, while, within, a, few, weeks, it, had, healed, leaving,
