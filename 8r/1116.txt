manihot, esculenta, commonly, called, cassava, manioc, or, yuca, among, numerous, regional, names, is, a, woody, shrub, of, the, spurge, family, euphorbiaceae, native, to, south, america, from, brazil, paraguay, and, parts, of, the, andes, although, a, perennial, plant, cassava, is, extensively, cultivated, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, as, an, annual, crop, for, its, edible, starchy, tuberous, root, cassava, is, predominantly, consumed, in, boiled, form, but, substantial, quantities, are, processed, to, extract, cassava, starch, called, tapioca, which, is, used, for, food, animal, feed, and, industrial, purposes, the, brazilian, farofa, and, the, related, garri, of, west, africa, is, an, edible, coarse, flour, obtained, by, grating, cassava, roots, pressing, moisture, off, the, obtained, grated, pulp, and, finally, drying, it, and, roasting, in, the, case, of, both, farofa, and, garri, cassava, is, the, third, largest, source, of, carbohydrates, in, food, in, the, tropics, after, rice, and, maize, making, it, an, important, staple, more, than, 500, million, people, depend, on, it, it, offers, the, advantage, of, being, exceptionally, drought, tolerant, and, able, to, grow, productively, on, poor, soil, the, largest, producer, is, nigeria, while, thailand, is, the, largest, exporter, of, cassava, starch, cassava, is, grown, in, sweet, and, bitter, varieties, both, contain, toxins, but, the, bitter, varieties, have, them, in, much, larger, amounts, cassava, has, to, be, prepared, carefully, for, consumption, as, improperly, prepared, material, can, contain, sufficient, cyanide, to, cause, poisoning, the, more, toxic, varieties, of, cassava, have, been, used, in, some, places, as, famine, food, during, times, of, food, insecurity, farmers, may, however, choose, bitter, cultivars, to, minimise, crop, losses, the, generic, name, manihot, and, the, common, name, manioc, both, derive, from, the, guarani, tupi, name, mandioca, or, manioca, for, the, plant, the, specific, name, esculenta, is, latin, for, edible, the, common, name, cassava, is, a, 16th, century, word, from, the, french, or, portuguese, cassave, in, turn, from, ta, no, ca, abi, the, common, name, yuca, or, yucca, is, most, likely, also, from, ta, no, via, spanish, yuca, or, juca, the, harvested, part, of, a, cassava, plant, is, the, root, this, is, long, and, tapered, with, an, easily, detached, rough, brown, rind, the, white, or, yellowish, flesh, is, firm, and, even, in, texture, commercial, cultivars, can, be, 5, to, 10, centimetres, 2, to, 4, in, wide, at, the, top, and, some, 15, to, 30, cm, 6, to, 12, in, long, with, a, woody, vascular, bundle, running, down, the, middle, the, tuberous, roots, are, largely, starch, with, small, amounts, of, calcium, 16, milligrams, per, 100, grams, phosphorus, 27, mg, 100, g, and, vitamin, c, 20, 6, mg, 100, g, cassava, roots, contains, little, protein, whereas, the, leaves, are, rich, in, it, except, for, being, low, in, methionine, an, essential, amino, acid, the, complete, and, haplotype, resolved, african, cassava, tme204, genome, has, been, reconstructed, and, made, available, using, the, hi, c, technology, the, genome, shows, abundant, novel, gene, loci, with, enriched, functionality, related, to, chromatin, organization, meristem, development, and, cell, responses, differentially, expressed, transcripts, of, different, haplotype, origins, were, enriched, for, different, functionality, during, tissue, development, in, each, tissue, 20, 30, of, transcripts, showed, allele, specific, expression, differences, with, 2, of, direction, shifting, despite, high, gene, synteny, the, hifi, genome, assembly, revealed, extensive, chromosome, rearrangements, and, abundant, intra, genomic, and, inter, genomic, divergent, sequences, with, significant, structural, variations, mostly, related, to, long, terminal, repeat, retrotransposons, although, smallholders, are, otherwise, economically, inefficient, producers, they, are, vital, to, productivity, at, particular, times, small, cassava, farmers, are, no, exception, genetic, diversity, is, vital, when, productivity, has, declined, due, to, pests, and, diseases, and, smallholders, tend, to, retain, less, productive, but, more, diverse, gene, pools, meft1, ft, is, a, gene, producing, ft, proteins, which, affect, the, formation, of, storage, roots, in, many, plants, including, this, one, alleles, in, cassava, include, meft1, and, meft2, meft1, expression, in, leaves, seems, to, not, be, photoperiodic, while, meft2, clearly, is, meft1, expression, encourages, motivation, of, sucrose, towards, the, reproductive, organs, as, shown, by, experimental, overexpression, reducing, storage, root, accumulation, wild, populations, of, m, esculenta, subspecies, flabellifolia, shown, to, be, the, progenitor, of, domesticated, cassava, are, centered, in, west, central, brazil, where, it, was, likely, first, domesticated, no, more, than, 10, 000, years, ago, forms, of, the, modern, domesticated, species, can, also, be, found, growing, in, the, wild, in, the, south, of, brazil, by, 4600, bc, cassava, pollen, appears, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, lowlands, at, the, san, andr, s, archaeological, site, the, oldest, direct, evidence, of, cassava, cultivation, comes, from, a, 1, 400, year, old, maya, site, joya, de, cer, n, in, el, salvador, it, became, a, staple, food, of, the, native, populations, of, northern, south, america, southern, mesoamerica, and, the, taino, people, in, the, caribbean, islands, who, grew, it, using, a, high, yielding, form, of, shifting, agriculture, by, the, time, of, european, contact, in, 1492, cassava, was, a, staple, food, of, pre, columbian, peoples, in, the, americas, and, is, often, portrayed, in, indigenous, art, the, moche, people, often, depicted, cassava, in, their, ceramics, spaniards, in, their, early, occupation, of, caribbean, islands, did, not, want, to, eat, cassava, or, maize, which, they, considered, insubstantial, dangerous, and, not, nutritious, they, much, preferred, foods, from, spain, specifically, wheat, bread, olive, oil, red, wine, and, meat, and, considered, maize, and, cassava, damaging, to, europeans, the, cultivation, and, consumption, of, cassava, were, nonetheless, continued, in, both, portuguese, and, spanish, america, mass, production, of, cassava, bread, became, the, first, cuban, industry, established, by, the, spanish, ships, departing, to, europe, from, cuban, ports, such, as, havana, santiago, bayamo, and, baracoa, carried, goods, to, spain, but, sailors, needed, to, be, provisioned, for, the, voyage, the, spanish, also, needed, to, replenish, their, boats, with, dried, meat, water, fruit, and, large, amounts, of, cassava, bread, sailors, complained, that, it, caused, them, digestive, problems, portuguese, traders, introduced, cassava, to, africa, from, brazil, in, the, 16th, century, around, the, same, period, it, was, introduced, to, asia, through, columbian, exchange, by, portuguese, and, spanish, traders, who, planted, it, in, their, colonies, in, goa, malacca, eastern, indonesia, timor, and, the, philippines, cassava, has, also, become, an, important, crop, in, asia, while, it, is, a, valued, food, staple, in, parts, of, eastern, indonesia, it, is, primarily, cultivated, for, starch, extraction, and, bio, fuel, production, in, thailand, cambodia, and, vietnam, cassava, is, sometimes, described, as, the, bread, of, the, tropics, but, should, not, be, confused, with, the, tropical, and, equatorial, bread, tree, encephalartos, the, breadfruit, artocarpus, altilis, or, the, african, breadfruit, treculia, africana, this, description, definitely, holds, in, africa, and, parts, of, south, america, in, asian, countries, such, as, vietnam, fresh, cassava, barely, features, in, human, diets, there, is, a, legend, that, cassava, was, introduced, in, 1880, 1885, ce, to, the, south, indian, state, of, kerala, by, the, king, of, travancore, vishakham, thirunal, maharaja, after, a, great, famine, hit, the, kingdom, as, a, substitute, for, rice, however, there, are, documented, cases, of, cassava, cultivation, in, parts, of, the, state, before, the, time, of, vishakham, thirunal, maharaja, cassava, is, called, kappa, or, maricheeni, in, malayalam, and, tapioca, in, indian, english, usage, optimal, conditions, for, cassava, cultivation, are, mean, annual, temperatures, between, 20, and, 29, c, 68, and, 84, f, annual, precipitation, between, 1, 000, and, 2, 500, mm, 39, and, 98, in, and, an, annual, growth, period, of, no, less, than, 240, days, cassava, is, propagated, by, cutting, the, stem, into, sections, of, approximately, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, these, being, planted, prior, to, the, wet, season, cassava, growth, is, favorable, under, temperatures, ranging, from, 25, to, 29, c, 77, to, 84, f, but, it, can, tolerate, temperatures, as, low, as, 12, c, 54, f, and, as, high, as, 40, c, 104, f, these, conditions, are, found, among, other, places, in, the, northern, part, of, the, gulf, coastal, plain, in, mexico, in, this, part, of, mexico, the, following, soil, types, have, been, shown, to, be, good, for, cassava, cultivation, phaeozem, regosol, arenosol, andosol, and, luvisol, cassava, is, subject, to, pests, from, multiple, taxonomic, groups, including, viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, and, insects, all, cause, reductions, in, yield, and, some, cause, serious, losses, of, crops, several, viruses, cause, enough, damage, to, cassava, crops, to, be, of, economic, importance, the, african, cassava, mosaic, virus, causes, the, leaves, of, the, cassava, plant, to, wither, limiting, the, growth, of, the, root, an, outbreak, of, the, virus, in, africa, in, the, 1920s, led, to, a, major, famine, the, virus, is, spread, by, the, whitefly, and, by, the, transplanting, of, diseased, plants, into, new, fields, sometime, in, the, late, 1980s, a, mutation, occurred, in, uganda, that, made, the, virus, even, more, harmful, causing, the, complete, loss, of, leaves, this, mutated, virus, spread, at, a, rate, of, 80, kilometres, 50, miles, per, year, and, as, of, 2005, was, found, throughout, uganda, rwanda, burundi, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, and, the, republic, of, the, congo, viruses, are, a, severe, production, limitation, in, the, tropics, they, are, the, primary, reason, for, the, complete, lack, of, yield, increases, in, the, 25, years, up, to, 2021, cassava, brown, streak, virus, disease, is, a, major, threat, to, cultivation, worldwide, cassava, mosaic, virus, cmv, is, widespread, in, africa, causing, cassava, mosaic, disease, cmd, bredeson, et, al, 2016, find, the, m, esculenta, cultivars, most, widely, used, on, that, continent, have, m, carthaginensis, subsp, glaziovii, genes, of, which, some, appear, to, be, cmd, resistance, genes, although, the, ongoing, cmd, pandemic, affects, both, east, and, central, africa, legg, et, al, found, that, these, two, areas, have, two, distinct, subpopulations, of, the, vector, bemisia, tabaci, whiteflies, genetically, engineered, cassava, offers, opportunities, for, the, improvement, of, virus, resistance, including, cmv, and, cbsd, resistance, among, the, most, serious, bacterial, pests, is, xanthomonas, axonopodis, pv, manihotis, which, causes, bacterial, blight, of, cassava, this, disease, originated, in, south, america, and, has, followed, cassava, around, the, world, bacterial, blight, has, been, responsible, for, near, catastrophic, losses, and, famine, in, past, decades, and, its, mitigation, requires, active, management, practices, several, other, bacteria, attack, cassava, including, the, related, xanthomonas, campestris, pv, cassavae, which, causes, bacterial, angular, leaf, spot, several, fungi, bring, about, significant, crop, losses, one, of, the, most, serious, being, cassava, root, rot, the, pathogens, involved, are, species, of, phytophthora, the, genus, which, causes, potato, blight, cassava, root, rot, can, result, in, losses, of, as, much, as, 80, percent, of, the, crop, a, major, pest, is, a, rust, caused, by, uromyces, manihotis, superelongation, disease, caused, by, elsino, brasiliensis, can, cause, losses, of, over, 80, percent, of, young, cassava, in, latin, america, when, temperature, and, rainfall, are, high, nematode, pests, of, cassava, are, thought, to, cause, harms, ranging, from, negligible, to, seriously, damaging, making, the, choice, of, management, methods, difficult, a, wide, range, of, plant, parasitic, nematodes, have, been, reported, associated, with, cassava, worldwide, these, include, pratylenchus, brachyurus, rotylenchulus, reniformis, helicotylenchus, spp, scutellonema, spp, and, meloidogyne, spp, of, which, meloidogyne, incognita, and, meloidogyne, javanica, are, the, most, widely, reported, and, economically, important, meloidogyne, spp, feeding, produces, physically, damaging, galls, with, eggs, inside, them, galls, later, merge, as, the, females, grow, and, enlarge, and, they, interfere, with, water, and, nutrient, supply, cassava, roots, become, tough, with, age, and, restrict, the, movement, of, the, juveniles, and, the, egg, release, it, is, therefore, possible, that, extensive, galling, can, be, observed, even, at, low, densities, following, infection, other, pests, and, diseases, can, gain, entry, through, the, physical, damage, caused, by, gall, formation, leading, to, rots, they, have, not, been, shown, to, cause, direct, damage, to, the, enlarged, tuberous, roots, but, plant, height, can, be, reduced, if, the, root, system, is, reduced, nematicides, reduce, the, numbers, of, galls, per, feeder, root, along, with, fewer, rots, in, the, tuberous, roots, the, organophosphorus, nematicide, femaniphos, does, not, reduce, crop, growth, or, harvest, yield, nematicide, use, in, cassava, is, not, terribly, effective, at, increasing, harvested, yield, but, lower, infestation, at, harvest, and, lower, subsequent, storage, loss, provide, a, higher, effective, yield, the, use, of, tolerant, and, resistant, cultivars, is, the, most, practical, management, method, in, most, locales, insects, such, as, stem, borers, and, other, beetles, moths, including, chilomima, clarkei, scale, insects, fruit, flies, shootflies, burrower, bugs, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, gall, midges, leafcutter, ants, and, termites, contribute, to, losses, of, cassava, in, the, field, while, others, contribute, to, serious, losses, between, 19, and, 30, of, dried, cassava, in, storage, in, africa, a, previous, issue, was, the, cassava, mealybug, phenacoccus, manihoti, and, cassava, green, mite, mononychellus, tanajoa, these, pests, can, cause, up, to, 80, percent, crop, loss, which, is, extremely, detrimental, to, the, production, of, subsistence, farmers, these, pests, were, rampant, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, but, were, brought, under, control, following, the, establishment, of, the, biological, control, centre, for, africa, of, the, international, institute, of, tropical, agriculture, iita, under, the, leadership, of, hans, rudolf, herren, the, centre, investigated, biological, control, for, cassava, pests, two, south, american, natural, enemies, anagyrus, lopezi, a, parasitoid, wasp, and, typhlodromalus, aripo, a, predatory, mite, were, found, to, effectively, control, the, cassava, mealybug, and, the, cassava, green, mite, respectively, before, harvest, the, leafy, stems, are, removed, the, harvest, is, gathered, by, pulling, up, the, base, of, the, stem, and, cutting, off, the, tuberous, roots, cassava, deteriorates, after, harvest, when, the, tuberous, roots, are, first, cut, the, healing, mechanism, produces, coumaric, acid, which, oxidizes, and, blackens, the, roots, making, them, inedible, after, a, few, days, this, deterioration, is, related, to, the, accumulation, of, reactive, oxygen, species, initiated, by, cyanide, release, during, mechanical, harvesting, cassava, shelf, life, may, be, increased, up, to, three, weeks, by, overexpressing, a, cyanide, insensitive, alternative, oxidase, which, suppressed, ros, by, 10, fold, post, harvest, deterioration, is, a, major, obstacle, to, the, export, of, cassava, fresh, cassava, can, be, preserved, like, potato, using, thiabendazole, or, bleach, as, a, fungicide, then, wrapping, in, plastic, freezing, or, applying, a, wax, coating, while, alternative, methods, for, controlling, post, harvest, deterioration, have, been, proposed, such, as, preventing, reactive, oxygen, species, effects, by, using, plastic, bags, during, storage, and, transport, coating, the, roots, with, wax, or, freezing, roots, such, strategies, have, proved, to, be, economically, or, technically, impractical, leading, to, breeding, of, cassava, varieties, with, improved, durability, after, harvest, achieved, by, different, mechanisms, one, approach, used, gamma, rays, to, try, to, silence, a, gene, involved, in, triggering, deterioration, another, strategy, selected, for, plentiful, carotenoids, antioxidants, which, may, help, to, reduce, oxidization, after, harvest, in, 2022, world, production, of, cassava, root, was, 330, million, tonnes, led, by, nigeria, with, 18, of, the, total, table, other, major, growers, were, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, and, thailand, cassava, is, the, third, largest, source, of, carbohydrates, in, food, in, the, tropics, after, rice, and, maize, making, it, an, important, staple, more, than, 500, million, people, depend, on, it, it, offers, the, advantage, of, being, exceptionally, drought, tolerant, and, able, to, grow, productively, on, poor, soil, cassava, grows, well, within, 30, of, the, equator, where, it, can, be, produced, at, up, to, 2, 000, m, 7, 000, ft, above, sea, level, and, with, 50, to, 5, 000, mm, 2, to, 200, in, of, rain, per, year, these, environmental, tolerances, suit, it, to, conditions, across, much, of, south, america, and, africa, cassava, yields, a, large, amount, of, food, energy, per, unit, area, of, land, per, day, 1, 000, 000, kj, ha, 250, 000, kcal, ha, as, compared, with, 650, 000, kj, ha, 156, 000, kcal, ha, for, rice, 460, 000, kj, ha, 110, 000, kcal, ha, for, wheat, and, 840, 000, kj, ha, 200, 000, kcal, ha, for, maize, cassava, yams, dioscorea, spp, and, sweet, potatoes, ipomoea, batatas, are, important, sources, of, food, in, the, tropics, the, cassava, plant, gives, the, third, highest, yield, of, carbohydrates, per, cultivated, area, among, crop, plants, after, sugarcane, and, sugar, beets, cassava, plays, a, particularly, important, role, in, agriculture, in, developing, countries, especially, in, sub, saharan, africa, because, it, does, well, on, poor, soils, and, with, low, rainfall, and, because, it, is, a, perennial, that, can, be, harvested, as, required, its, wide, harvesting, window, allows, it, to, act, as, a, famine, reserve, and, is, invaluable, in, managing, labor, schedules, it, offers, flexibility, to, resource, poor, farmers, because, it, serves, as, either, a, subsistence, or, a, cash, crop, worldwide, 800, million, people, depend, on, cassava, as, their, primary, food, staple, cassava, roots, peels, and, leaves, are, dangerous, to, eat, raw, because, they, contain, linamarin, and, lotaustralin, which, are, toxic, cyanogenic, glycosides, these, are, decomposed, by, the, cassava, enzyme, linamarase, releasing, poisonous, hydrogen, cyanide, cassava, varieties, are, often, categorized, as, either, bitter, high, in, cyanogenic, glycosides, or, sweet, low, in, those, bitter, compounds, sweet, cultivars, can, contain, as, little, as, 20, milligrams, of, cyanide, per, kilogram, of, fresh, roots, whereas, bitter, cultivars, may, contain, as, much, as, 1000, milligrams, per, kilogram, cassavas, grown, during, drought, are, especially, high, in, these, toxins, a, dose, of, 25, mg, of, pure, cassava, cyanogenic, glucoside, which, contains, 2, 5, mg, of, cyanide, is, sufficient, to, kill, a, rat, excess, cyanide, residue, from, improper, preparation, causes, goiters, and, acute, cyanide, poisoning, and, is, linked, to, ataxia, a, neurological, disorder, affecting, the, ability, to, walk, also, known, as, konzo, it, has, also, been, linked, to, tropical, fibrocalcific, pancreatitis, in, humans, leading, to, chronic, pancreatitis, symptoms, of, acute, cyanide, intoxication, appear, four, or, more, hours, after, ingesting, raw, or, poorly, processed, cassava, vertigo, vomiting, goiter, ataxia, partial, paralysis, collapse, and, death, it, can, be, treated, easily, with, an, injection, of, thiosulfate, which, makes, sulfur, available, for, the, patient, s, body, to, detoxify, by, converting, the, poisonous, cyanide, into, thiocyanate, chronic, low, level, exposure, to, cyanide, may, contribute, to, both, goiter, and, tropical, ataxic, neuropathy, also, called, konzo, which, can, be, fatal, the, risk, is, highest, in, famines, when, as, many, as, 3, percent, of, the, population, may, be, affected, like, many, other, roots, and, tubers, both, bitter, and, sweet, varieties, of, cassava, contain, antinutritional, factors, and, toxins, with, the, bitter, varieties, containing, much, larger, amounts, the, more, toxic, varieties, of, cassava, have, been, used, in, some, places, as, famine, food, during, times, of, food, insecurity, for, example, during, the, shortages, in, venezuela, in, the, late, 2010s, dozens, of, deaths, were, reported, due, to, venezuelans, resorting, to, eating, bitter, cassava, in, order, to, curb, starvation, cases, of, cassava, poisoning, were, also, documented, during, the, famine, accompanying, the, great, leap, forward, 1958, 1962, in, china, farmers, may, select, bitter, cultivars, to, reduce, crop, losses, societies, that, traditionally, eat, cassava, generally, understand, that, processing, soaking, cooking, fermentation, etc, is, necessary, to, avoid, getting, sick, brief, soaking, four, hours, of, cassava, is, not, sufficient, but, soaking, for, 18, 24, hours, can, remove, up, to, half, the, level, of, cyanide, drying, may, not, be, sufficient, either, for, some, smaller, rooted, sweet, varieties, cooking, is, sufficient, to, eliminate, all, toxicity, the, cyanide, is, carried, away, in, the, processing, water, and, the, amounts, produced, in, domestic, consumption, are, too, small, to, have, environmental, impact, the, larger, rooted, bitter, varieties, used, for, production, of, flour, or, starch, must, be, processed, to, remove, the, cyanogenic, glucosides, the, large, roots, are, peeled, and, then, ground, into, flour, which, is, then, soaked, in, water, squeezed, dry, several, times, and, toasted, the, starch, grains, that, flow, with, the, water, during, the, soaking, process, are, also, used, in, cooking, the, flour, is, used, throughout, south, america, and, the, caribbean, industrial, production, of, cassava, flour, even, at, the, cottage, level, may, generate, enough, cyanide, and, cyanogenic, glycosides, in, the, effluents, to, have, a, severe, environmental, impact, there, are, many, ways, of, cooking, cassava, it, has, to, be, prepared, correctly, to, remove, its, toxicity, the, root, of, the, sweet, variety, is, mild, to, the, taste, like, potatoes, jewish, households, sometimes, use, it, in, cholent, it, can, be, made, into, a, flour, that, is, used, in, breads, cakes, and, cookies, in, brazil, farofa, a, dry, meal, made, from, cooked, powdered, cassava, is, roasted, in, butter, eaten, as, a, side, dish, or, sprinkled, on, other, food, alcoholic, beverages, made, from, cassava, include, cauim, brazil, kasiri, venezuela, guyana, suriname, parakari, or, kari, venezuela, guyana, surinam, and, nihamanchi, south, america, a, safe, processing, method, known, as, the, wetting, method, is, to, mix, the, cassava, flour, with, water, into, a, thick, paste, spread, it, in, a, thin, layer, over, a, basket, and, then, let, it, stand, for, five, hours, at, 30, c, in, the, shade, in, that, time, about, 83, of, the, cyanogenic, glycosides, are, broken, down, by, linamarase, the, resulting, hydrogen, cyanide, escapes, to, the, atmosphere, making, the, flour, safe, for, consumption, the, same, evening, the, traditional, method, used, in, west, africa, is, to, peel, the, roots, and, put, them, into, water, for, three, days, to, ferment, the, roots, are, then, dried, or, cooked, in, nigeria, and, several, other, west, african, countries, including, ghana, cameroon, benin, togo, ivory, coast, and, burkina, faso, they, are, usually, grated, and, lightly, fried, in, palm, oil, to, preserve, them, the, result, is, a, foodstuff, called, garri, fermentation, is, also, used, in, other, places, such, as, indonesia, such, as, tapai, the, fermentation, process, also, reduces, the, level, of, antinutrients, making, the, cassava, a, more, nutritious, food, the, reliance, on, cassava, as, a, food, source, and, the, resulting, exposure, to, the, goitrogenic, effects, of, thiocyanate, has, been, responsible, for, the, endemic, goiters, seen, in, the, akoko, area, of, southwestern, nigeria, a, traditional, method, used, by, the, lucayans, to, detoxify, cassava, is, by, peeling, grinding, and, mashing, filtering, the, mash, through, a, basket, tube, to, remove, the, hydrogen, cyanide, and, drying, and, sieving, the, mash, for, flour, the, poisonous, filtrate, water, was, boiled, to, release, the, hydrogen, cyanide, and, used, as, a, base, for, stews, bioengineering, has, been, applied, to, grow, cassava, with, lower, cyanogenic,
