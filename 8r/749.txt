the, snow, leopard, panthera, uncia, is, a, species, of, large, cat, in, the, genus, panthera, of, the, family, felidae, the, species, is, native, to, the, mountain, ranges, of, central, and, south, asia, it, is, listed, as, vulnerable, on, the, iucn, red, list, because, the, global, population, is, estimated, to, number, fewer, than, 10, 000, mature, individuals, and, is, expected, to, decline, about, 10, by, 2040, it, is, mainly, threatened, by, poaching, and, habitat, destruction, following, infrastructural, developments, it, inhabits, alpine, and, subalpine, zones, at, elevations, of, 3, 000, 4, 500, m, 9, 800, 14, 800, ft, ranging, from, eastern, afghanistan, the, himalayas, and, the, tibetan, plateau, to, southern, siberia, mongolia, and, western, china, in, the, northern, part, of, its, range, it, also, lives, at, lower, elevations, taxonomically, the, snow, leopard, was, long, classified, in, the, monotypic, genus, uncia, since, phylogenetic, studies, revealed, the, relationships, among, panthera, species, it, has, since, been, considered, a, member, of, that, genus, two, subspecies, were, described, based, on, morphological, differences, but, genetic, differences, between, the, two, have, not, yet, been, confirmed, it, is, therefore, regarded, as, a, monotypic, species, the, species, is, widely, depicted, in, kyrgyz, culture, the, old, french, word, once, which, was, intended, to, be, used, for, the, eurasian, lynx, lynx, lynx, is, where, the, latin, name, uncia, and, the, english, word, ounce, both, originate, once, is, believed, to, have, originated, from, a, previous, form, of, the, word, lynx, through, a, process, known, as, false, splitting, the, word, once, was, originally, considered, to, be, pronounced, as, l, once, where, l, stands, for, the, elided, form, of, the, word, la, the, in, french, once, was, then, understood, to, be, the, name, of, the, animal, the, word, panther, derives, from, the, classical, latin, panth, ra, itself, from, the, ancient, greek, p, nth, r, which, was, used, for, spotted, cats, felis, uncia, was, the, scientific, name, used, by, johann, christian, daniel, von, schreber, in, 1777, who, described, a, snow, leopard, based, on, an, earlier, description, by, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, assuming, that, the, cat, occurred, along, the, barbary, coast, in, persia, east, india, and, china, the, genus, name, uncia, was, proposed, by, john, edward, gray, in, 1854, for, asian, cats, with, a, long, and, thick, tail, felis, irbis, proposed, by, christian, gottfried, ehrenberg, in, 1830, was, a, skin, of, a, female, snow, leopard, collected, in, the, altai, mountains, he, also, clarified, that, several, leopard, p, pardus, skins, were, previously, misidentified, as, snow, leopard, skins, felis, uncioides, proposed, by, thomas, horsfield, in, 1855, was, a, snow, leopard, skin, from, nepal, in, the, collection, of, the, museum, of, the, east, india, company, uncia, uncia, was, used, by, reginald, innes, pocock, in, 1930, when, he, reviewed, skins, and, skulls, of, panthera, species, from, asia, he, also, described, morphological, differences, between, snow, leopard, and, leopard, skins, panthera, baikalensis, romanii, proposed, by, a, russian, scientist, in, 2000, was, a, dark, brown, snow, leopard, skin, from, the, petrovsk, zabaykalsky, district, in, southern, transbaikal, the, snow, leopard, was, long, classified, in, the, monotypic, genus, uncia, they, were, subordinated, to, the, genus, panthera, based, on, results, of, phylogenetic, studies, until, spring, 2017, there, was, no, evidence, available, for, the, recognition, of, subspecies, results, of, a, phylogeographic, analysis, indicate, that, three, subspecies, should, be, recognised, this, view, has, been, both, contested, and, supported, by, different, researchers, additionally, an, extinct, subspecies, panthera, uncia, pyrenaica, was, described, in, 2022, based, on, material, found, in, france, its, fossil, was, dated, to, the, early, middle, pleistocene, around, 0, 57, to, 0, 53, million, years, ago, based, on, the, phylogenetic, analysis, of, the, dna, sequence, sampled, across, the, living, felidae, the, snow, leopard, forms, a, sister, group, with, the, tiger, p, tigris, the, genetic, divergence, time, of, this, group, is, estimated, at, 4, 62, to, 1, 82, million, years, ago, the, snow, leopard, and, the, tiger, probably, diverged, between, 3, 7, to, 2, 7, million, years, ago, panthera, originates, most, likely, in, northern, central, asia, panthera, blytheae, excavated, in, western, tibet, s, ngari, prefecture, has, been, initially, described, the, oldest, known, panthera, species, and, exhibits, skull, characteristics, similar, to, the, snow, leopard, though, its, taxonomic, placement, has, been, disputed, by, other, researchers, who, suggest, that, the, species, likely, belongs, to, a, different, genus, the, mitochondrial, genomes, of, the, snow, leopard, the, leopard, and, the, lion, p, leo, are, more, similar, to, each, other, than, their, nuclear, genomes, indicating, that, their, ancestors, hybridised, at, some, point, in, their, evolution, the, snow, leopard, s, fur, is, whitish, to, grey, with, black, spots, on, the, head, and, neck, with, larger, rosettes, on, the, back, flanks, and, bushy, tail, its, muzzle, is, short, its, forehead, domed, and, its, nasal, cavities, are, large, the, fur, is, thick, with, hairs, measuring, 5, to, 12, cm, 2, 0, to, 4, 7, in, in, length, and, its, underbelly, is, whitish, they, are, stocky, short, legged, and, slightly, smaller, than, other, cats, of, the, genus, panthera, reaching, a, shoulder, height, of, 56, cm, 22, in, and, ranging, in, head, to, body, size, from, 75, to, 150, cm, 30, to, 59, in, its, tail, is, 80, to, 105, cm, 31, to, 41, in, long, males, average, 45, to, 55, kg, 99, to, 121, lb, and, females, 35, to, 40, kg, 77, to, 88, lb, occasionally, large, males, reaching, 75, kg, 165, lb, have, been, recorded, and, small, females, under, 25, kg, 55, lb, its, canine, teeth, are, 28, 6, mm, 1, 13, in, long, and, are, more, slender, than, those, of, the, other, panthera, species, the, snow, leopard, shows, several, adaptations, for, living, in, cold, mountainous, environments, its, small, rounded, ears, help, to, minimize, heat, loss, and, its, broad, paws, effectively, distribute, the, body, weight, for, walking, on, snow, fur, on, the, undersides, of, the, paws, enhances, its, grip, on, steep, and, unstable, surfaces, and, helps, to, minimize, heat, loss, its, long, and, flexible, tail, helps, the, cat, to, balance, in, rocky, terrain, the, tail, is, very, thick, due, to, fat, storage, and, is, covered, in, a, thick, layer, of, fur, which, allows, the, cat, to, use, it, like, a, blanket, to, protect, its, face, when, asleep, the, snow, leopard, differs, from, the, other, panthera, species, by, a, shorter, muzzle, an, elevated, forehead, a, vertical, chin, and, a, less, developed, posterior, process, of, the, lower, jaw, despite, its, partly, ossified, hyoid, bone, a, snow, leopard, cannot, roar, as, its, 9, mm, 0, 35, in, short, vocal, folds, provide, little, resistance, to, airflow, its, nasal, openings, are, large, in, relation, to, the, length, of, its, skull, and, width, of, its, palate, thanks, to, their, size, the, volume, of, air, inhaled, with, each, breath, is, optimised, and, the, cold, dry, air, becomes, warmer, it, is, not, especially, adapted, to, high, altitude, hypoxia, the, snow, leopard, is, distributed, from, the, west, of, lake, baikal, through, southern, siberia, in, the, kunlun, mountains, altai, mountains, sayan, and, tannu, ola, mountains, in, the, tian, shan, through, tajikistan, kyrgyzstan, uzbekistan, and, kazakhstan, to, the, hindu, kush, in, eastern, afghanistan, karakoram, in, northern, pakistan, in, the, pamir, mountains, the, tibetan, plateau, and, in, the, high, elevations, of, the, himalayas, in, india, nepal, and, bhutan, in, mongolia, they, inhabit, the, mongolian, and, gobi, altai, mountains, and, the, khangai, mountains, in, tibet, they, occur, up, to, the, altyn, tagh, in, the, north, they, inhabit, alpine, and, subalpine, zones, at, elevations, of, 3, 000, to, 4, 500, m, 9, 800, to, 14, 800, ft, but, also, lives, at, lower, elevations, in, the, northern, part, of, their, range, potential, snow, leopard, habitat, in, the, indian, himalayas, is, estimated, at, less, than, 90, 000, km, 2, 35, 000, sq, mi, in, jammu, and, kashmir, ladakh, uttarakhand, himachal, pradesh, sikkim, and, arunachal, pradesh, of, which, about, 34, 000, km, 2, 13, 000, sq, mi, is, considered, good, habitat, and, 14, 4, is, protected, in, the, beginning, of, the, 1990s, the, indian, snow, leopard, population, was, estimated, at, 200, 600, individuals, living, across, about, 25, protected, areas, the, snow, leopard, population, assessment, in, india, spai, programme, counted, the, number, of, snow, leopards, between, 2019, and, 2023, and, found, their, number, to, be, 718, with, 477, in, ladakh, 124, in, uttarakhand, 51, in, himachal, pradesh, 36, in, arunachal, pradesh, 21, in, sikkim, and, nine, in, jammu, and, kashmir, in, summer, the, snow, leopard, usually, lives, above, the, tree, line, on, alpine, meadows, and, in, rocky, regions, at, elevations, of, 2, 700, to, 6, 000, m, 8, 900, to, 19, 700, ft, in, winter, they, descend, to, elevations, around, 1, 200, to, 2, 000, m, 3, 900, to, 6, 600, ft, they, prefer, rocky, broken, terrain, and, can, move, in, 85, cm, 33, in, deep, snow, but, prefers, to, use, existing, trails, made, by, other, animals, snow, leopards, were, recorded, by, camera, traps, at, 16, locations, in, northeastern, afghanistan, s, isolated, wakhan, corridor, the, snow, leopard, s, vocalizations, include, meowing, grunting, prusten, and, moaning, they, can, purr, when, exhaling, it, is, solitary, and, mostly, active, at, dawn, till, early, morning, and, again, in, afternoons, and, early, evenings, they, mostly, rest, near, cliffs, and, ridges, that, provide, vantage, points, and, shade, in, nepal, s, shey, phoksundo, national, park, the, home, ranges, of, five, adult, radio, collared, snow, leopards, largely, overlapped, though, they, rarely, met, their, individual, home, ranges, ranged, from, 12, to, 39, km, 2, 4, 6, to, 15, 1, sq, mi, males, moved, between, 0, 5, and, 5, 45, km, 0, 31, and, 3, 39, mi, per, day, and, females, between, 0, 2, and, 2, 25, km, 0, 12, and, 1, 40, mi, measured, in, straight, lines, between, survey, points, since, they, often, zigzagged, in, the, precipitous, terrain, they, actually, moved, up, to, 7, km, 4, 3, mi, in, a, single, night, up, to, 10, individuals, inhabit, an, area, of, 100, km, 2, 39, sq, mi, in, habitats, with, sparse, prey, an, area, of, 1, 000, km, 2, 390, sq, mi, usually, supports, only, five, individuals, a, study, in, the, gobi, desert, from, 2008, to, 2014, revealed, that, adult, males, used, a, mean, home, range, of, 144, 270, km, 2, 56, 104, sq, mi, while, adult, females, ranged, in, areas, of, 83, 165, km, 2, 32, 64, sq, mi, their, home, ranges, overlapped, less, than, 20, these, results, indicate, that, about, 40, of, the, 170, protected, areas, in, their, range, countries, are, smaller, than, the, home, range, of, a, single, male, snow, leopard, snow, leopards, leave, scent, marks, to, indicate, their, territories, and, common, travel, routes, they, scrape, the, ground, with, the, hind, feet, before, depositing, urine, or, feces, but, also, spray, urine, onto, rocks, their, urine, contains, many, characteristic, low, molecular, weight, compounds, with, diverse, functional, groups, including, pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, 3, octanone, nonanal, and, indole, which, possibly, play, a, role, in, chemical, communication, the, snow, leopard, is, a, carnivore, and, actively, hunts, its, prey, its, preferred, wild, prey, species, are, himalayan, blue, sheep, pseudois, nayaur, himalayan, tahr, hemitragus, jemlahicus, argali, ovis, ammon, markhor, capra, falconeri, and, wild, goat, c, aegagrus, it, also, preys, on, domestic, livestock, it, prefers, prey, ranging, in, weight, from, 36, to, 76, kg, 79, to, 168, lb, but, also, hunts, smaller, mammals, such, as, himalayan, marmot, marmota, himalayana, pika, and, vole, species, its, diet, depends, on, prey, availability, and, varies, across, its, range, and, season, in, the, himalayas, it, preys, mostly, on, himalayan, blue, sheep, siberian, ibex, c, sibirica, white, bellied, musk, deer, moschus, leucogaster, and, wild, boar, sus, scrofa, in, the, karakoram, tian, shan, altai, and, mongolia, s, tost, mountains, its, main, prey,

near, gangotri, national, park, in, mongolia, domestic, sheep, comprises, less, than, 20, of, its, diet, although, wild, prey, has, been, reduced, and, interactions, with, people, are, common, it, is, capable, of, killing, most, ungulates, in, its, habitat, with, the, probable, exception, of, the, adult, male, wild, yak, it, also, eats, grass, and, twigs, the, snow, leopard, actively, pursues, prey, down, steep, mountainsides, using, the, momentum, of, its, initial, leap, to, chase, animals, for, up, to, 300, m, 980, ft, then, it, drags, the, prey, to, a, safe, location, and, consumes, all, edible, parts, of, the, carcass, it, can, survive, on, a, single, himalayan, blue, sheep, for, two, weeks, before, hunting, again, and, one, adult, individual, apparently, needs, 20, 30, adult, blue, sheep, per, year, snow, leopards, have, been, recorded, to, hunt, successfully, in, pairs, especially, mating, pairs, the, snow, leopard, is, easily, driven, away, from, livestock, and, readily, abandons, kills, often, without, defending, itself, only, two, attacks, on, humans, have, been, reported, both, near, almaty, in, kazakhstan, and, neither, were, fatal, in, 1940, a, rabid, snow, leopard, attacked, two, men, and, an, old, toothless, emaciated, individual, attacked, a, person, passing, by, snow, leopards, become, sexually, mature, at, two, to, three, years, and, normally, live, for, 15, 18, years, in, the, wild, in, captivity, they, can, live, for, up, to, 25, years, oestrus, typically, lasts, five, to, eight, days, and, males, tend, not, to, seek, out, another, partner, after, mating, probably, because, the, short, mating, season, does, not, allow, sufficient, time, paired, snow, leopards, mate, in, the, usual, felid, posture, from, 12, to, 36, times, a, day, they, are, unusual, among, large, cats, in, that, they, have, a, well, defined, birth, peak, they, usually, mate, in, late, winter, marked, by, a, noticeable, increase, in, marking, and, calling, females, have, a, gestation, period, of, 90, 100, days, and, the, cubs, are, born, between, april, and, june, a, litter, usually, consists, of, two, to, three, cubs, in, exceptional, cases, there, can, be, up, to, seven, the, female, gives, birth, in, a, rocky, den, or, crevice, lined, with, fur, shed, from, her, underside, the, cubs, are, born, blind, and, helpless, although, already, with, a, thick, coat,
