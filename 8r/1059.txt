the, garden, strawberry, or, simply, strawberry, fragaria, ananassa, is, a, widely, grown, hybrid, species, of, the, genus, fragaria, in, the, rose, family, rosaceae, collectively, known, as, the, strawberries, which, are, cultivated, worldwide, for, their, fruit, the, fruit, is, widely, appreciated, for, its, characteristic, aroma, bright, red, color, juicy, texture, and, sweetness, it, is, consumed, in, large, quantities, either, fresh, or, in, such, prepared, foods, as, jam, juice, pies, ice, cream, milkshakes, and, chocolates, artificial, strawberry, flavorings, and, aromas, are, also, widely, used, in, products, such, as, confectionery, soap, lip, gloss, perfume, and, many, others, the, garden, strawberry, was, first, bred, in, brittany, france, in, the, 1750s, via, a, cross, of, fragaria, virginiana, from, eastern, north, america, and, fragaria, chiloensis, which, was, brought, from, chile, by, am, d, e, fran, ois, fr, zier, in, 1714, cultivars, of, fragaria, ananassa, have, replaced, in, commercial, production, the, woodland, strawberry, fragaria, vesca, which, was, the, first, strawberry, species, cultivated, in, the, early, 17th, century, from, a, botanical, point, of, view, the, strawberry, is, not, a, berry, but, an, aggregate, accessory, fruit, meaning, that, the, fleshy, part, is, derived, not, from, the, plant, s, ovaries, but, from, the, receptacle, that, holds, the, ovaries, each, apparent, seed, achene, on, the, outside, of, the, fruit, is, actually, one, of, the, ovaries, of, the, flower, with, a, seed, inside, it, in, 2019, world, production, of, strawberries, was, nine, million, tons, led, by, china, with, 40, of, the, total, the, first, garden, strawberry, was, grown, in, brittany, france, during, the, late, 18th, century, prior, to, this, wild, strawberries, and, cultivated, selections, from, wild, strawberry, species, were, the, common, source, of, the, fruit, the, strawberry, fruit, was, mentioned, in, ancient, roman, literature, in, reference, to, its, medicinal, use, the, french, began, taking, the, strawberry, from, the, forest, to, their, gardens, for, harvest, in, the, 14th, century, charles, v, of, france, r, 1364, 1380, had, 1, 200, strawberry, plants, in, his, royal, garden, in, the, early, 15th, century, western, european, monks, were, using, the, wild, strawberry, in, their, illuminated, manuscripts, the, strawberry, is, found, in, italian, flemish, and, german, art, and, in, english, miniatures, the, entire, strawberry, plant, was, used, to, treat, depressive, illnesses, by, the, 16th, century, references, of, cultivation, of, the, strawberry, became, more, common, people, began, using, it, for, its, supposed, medicinal, properties, and, botanists, began, naming, the, different, species, in, england, the, demand, for, regular, strawberry, farming, had, increased, by, the, mid, 16th, century, the, combination, of, strawberries, and, cream, was, created, by, thomas, wolsey, in, the, court, of, king, henry, viii, instructions, for, growing, and, harvesting, strawberries, showed, up, in, writing, in, 1578, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, three, european, species, had, been, cited, f, vesca, f, moschata, and, f, viridis, the, garden, strawberry, was, transplanted, from, the, forests, and, then, the, plants, would, be, propagated, asexually, by, cutting, off, the, runners, two, subspecies, of, f, vesca, were, identified, f, sylvestris, alba, and, f, sylvestris, semperflorens, the, introduction, of, f, virginiana, from, eastern, north, america, to, europe, in, the, 17th, century, is, an, important, part, of, history, because, it, is, one, of, the, two, species, that, gave, rise, to, the, modern, strawberry, the, new, species, gradually, spread, through, the, continent, and, did, not, become, completely, appreciated, until, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, a, french, excursion, journeyed, to, chile, in, 1712, which, led, to, the, introduction, of, a, strawberry, plant, with, female, flowers, that, resulted, in, the, common, strawberry, the, mapuche, and, huilliche, indians, of, chile, cultivated, the, female, strawberry, species, until, 1551, when, the, spanish, came, to, conquer, the, land, in, 1765, a, european, explorer, recorded, the, cultivation, of, f, chiloensis, the, chilean, strawberry, at, first, introduction, to, europe, the, plants, grew, vigorously, but, produced, no, fruit, french, gardeners, in, brest, and, cherbourg, around, the, mid, 18th, century, first, noticed, that, when, f, moschata, and, f, virginiana, were, planted, in, between, rows, of, f, chiloensis, the, chilean, strawberry, would, bear, abundant, and, unusually, large, fruits, soon, after, antoine, nicolas, duchesne, began, to, study, the, breeding, of, strawberries, and, made, several, discoveries, crucial, to, the, science, of, plant, breeding, such, as, the, sexual, reproduction, of, the, strawberry, which, he, published, in, 1766, duchesne, discovered, that, the, female, f, chiloensis, plants, could, only, be, pollinated, by, male, f, moschata, or, f, virginiana, plants, this, is, when, the, europeans, became, aware, that, plants, had, the, ability, to, produce, male, only, or, female, only, flowers, duchesne, determined, f, ananassa, to, be, a, hybrid, of, f, chiloensis, and, f, virginiana, f, ananassa, which, produces, large, fruits, is, so, named, because, it, resembles, the, pineapple, in, smell, taste, and, berry, shape, in, england, many, varieties, of, f, ananassa, were, produced, and, they, form, the, basis, of, modern, varieties, of, strawberries, currently, cultivated, and, consumed, further, breeding, was, also, conducted, in, europe, and, america, to, improve, the, hardiness, disease, resistance, size, and, taste, during, the, green, revolution, of, the, 1950s, agronomists, used, selective, breeding, to, expand, phenotypic, diversity, of, the, garden, strawberry, adoption, of, perpetual, flowering, hybrids, not, sensitive, to, changes, in, photoperiod, gave, higher, yields, and, expansion, of, production, in, california, raw, strawberries, are, 91, water, 8, carbohydrates, 1, protein, and, contain, negligible, fat, table, a, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, reference, amount, of, strawberries, supplies, 33, kilocalories, is, a, rich, source, of, vitamin, c, 71, of, the, daily, value, dv, a, good, source, of, manganese, 18, dv, and, provides, several, other, vitamins, and, dietary, minerals, in, small, amounts, strawberries, contain, a, modest, amount, of, essential, unsaturated, fatty, acids, in, the, achene, seed, oil, garden, strawberries, contain, the, dimeric, ellagitannin, agrimoniin, which, is, an, isomer, of, sanguiin, h, 6, other, polyphenols, present, include, flavonoids, such, as, anthocyanins, flavanols, flavonols, and, phenolic, acids, such, as, hydroxybenzoic, acid, and, hydroxycinnamic, acid, strawberries, contain, fisetin, and, possess, higher, levels, of, this, flavonoid, than, other, fruits, although, achenes, comprise, only, about, 1, of, total, fresh, weight, of, a, strawberry, they, contribute, 11, of, the, total, polyphenol, in, the, whole, fruit, achene, phytochemicals, include, ellagic, acid, ellagic, acid, glycosides, and, ellagitannins, pelargonidin, 3, glucoside, is, the, major, anthocyanin, in, strawberries, and, cyanidin, 3, glucoside, is, found, in, smaller, proportions, although, glucose, seems, to, be, the, most, common, substituting, sugar, in, strawberry, anthocyanins, rutinose, arabinose, and, rhamnose, conjugates, have, been, found, in, some, strawberry, cultivars, purple, minor, pigments, consisting, of, dimeric, anthocyanins, flavanol, anthocyanin, adducts, catechin, 4, 8, pelargonidin, 3, o, glucopyranoside, epicatechin, 4, 8, pelargonidin, 3, o, glucopyranoside, afzelechin, 4, 8, pelargonidin, 3, o, glucopyranoside, and, epiafzelechin, 4, 8, pelargonidin, 3, o, glucopyranoside, can, also, be, found, in, strawberries, sweetness, fragrance, and, complex, flavor, are, favorable, attributes, in, plant, breeding, and, farming, emphasis, is, placed, on, sugars, acids, and, volatile, compounds, which, improve, the, taste, and, fragrance, of, a, ripe, strawberry, although, often, sweet, tasting, strawberries, actually, have, relatively, low, sugar, levels, compared, to, other, fruits, esters, terpenes, and, furans, are, the, chemical, compounds, having, the, strongest, relationships, to, strawberry, flavor, sweetness, and, fragrance, with, a, total, of, 31, out, of, some, 360, volatile, compounds, significantly, correlated, to, favorable, flavor, and, fragrance, in, breeding, strawberries, for, the, commercial, market, in, the, united, states, the, volatile, compounds, methyl, anthranilate, and, gamma, decalactone, prominent, in, aromatic, wild, strawberries, are, especially, desired, for, their, sweet, and, fruity, aroma, characteristics, as, strawberry, flavor, and, fragrance, are, characteristics, that, may, appeal, to, consumers, they, are, used, widely, in, a, variety, of, manufacturing, including, foods, beverages, confections, perfumes, and, cosmetics, modern, strawberries, are, octoploid, 8, sets, of, chromosomes, the, genome, sequence, of, the, garden, strawberry, was, published, in, 2019, some, people, experience, an, anaphylactoid, reaction, to, eating, strawberries, the, most, common, form, of, this, reaction, is, oral, allergy, syndrome, but, symptoms, may, also, mimic, hay, fever, or, include, dermatitis, or, hives, and, in, severe, cases, may, cause, breathing, problems, proteomic, studies, indicate, that, the, allergen, may, be, tied, to, a, protein, for, the, red, anthocyanin, biosynthesis, expressed, in, strawberry, ripening, named, fra, a1, fragaria, allergen1, homologous, proteins, are, found, in, birch, pollen, and, apple, suggesting, that, people, may, develop, cross, reactivity, to, all, three, species, white, fruited, strawberry, cultivars, lacking, fra, a1, may, be, an, option, for, strawberry, allergy, sufferers, since, they, lack, a, protein, necessary, for, normal, ripening, by, anthocyanin, synthesis, of, red, pigments, the, mature, berries, do, not, turn, red, like, other, cultivars, they, ripen, but, remain, white, pale, yellow, or, golden, appearing, like, immature, berries, this, also, has, the, advantage, of, making, them, less, attractive, to, birds, a, virtually, allergen, free, cultivar, named, sofar, is, available, strawberries, are, often, grouped, according, to, their, flowering, habit, traditionally, this, has, consisted, of, a, division, between, june, bearing, strawberries, which, bear, their, fruit, in, the, early, summer, and, ever, bearing, strawberries, which, often, bear, several, crops, of, fruit, throughout, the, season, one, plant, throughout, a, season, may, produce, 50, to, 60, times, or, roughly, once, every, three, days, strawberries, occur, in, three, basic, flowering, habits, short, day, long, day, and, day, neutral, these, describe, the, day, length, sensitivity, of, the, plant, and, the, type, of, photoperiod, that, induces, flower, formation, day, neutral, cultivars, produce, flowers, regardless, of, the, photoperiod, strawberry, cultivars, vary, widely, in, size, color, flavor, shape, degree, of, fertility, season, of, ripening, liability, to, disease, and, constitution, of, plant, on, average, a, strawberry, has, about, 200, seeds, on, its, external, membrane, some, vary, in, foliage, while, others, vary, materially, in, the, development, of, their, sexual, organs, in, most, cases, the, flowers, appear, hermaphroditic, in, structure, but, function, as, either, male, or, female, in, addition, to, being, consumed, fresh, strawberries, can, be, frozen, or, made, into, jam, or, preserves, as, well, as, dried, and, used, in, prepared, foods, such, as, cereal, bars, strawberries, and, strawberry, flavorings, are, a, popular, addition, to, dairy, products, such, as, strawberry, milk, strawberry, ice, cream, strawberry, milkshakes, smoothies, and, strawberry, yogurts, in, the, united, kingdom, strawberries, and, cream, is, a, popular, dessert, consumed, at, the, wimbledon, tennis, tournament, strawberries, and, cream, is, also, a, staple, snack, in, mexico, usually, available, at, ice, cream, parlors, in, sweden, strawberries, are, a, traditional, dessert, served, on, midsummer, s, eve, depending, on, area, strawberry, pie, strawberry, rhubarb, pie, or, strawberry, shortcake, are, also, common, in, greece, strawberries, may, be, sprinkled, with, sugar, and, then, dipped, in, metaxa, a, brandy, and, served, as, a, dessert, in, italy, strawberries, are, used, for, various, desserts, and, as, a, common, flavoring, for, gelato, gelato, alla, fragola, fresh, strawberries, are, used, as, cocktail, garnishes, to, add, flavor, and, texture, to, a, drink, polyphenol, extracted, from, strawberries, have, been, used, in, kanazawa, japan, to, create, melting, resistant, popsicles, in, 2022, world, production, of, strawberries, was, 9, 6, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 35, of, the, total, and, the, united, states, and, turkey, as, other, significant, producers, table, due, to, the, relatively, fragile, nature, of, the, strawberry, approximately, 35, percent, of, the, 2, 2, billion, united, states, crop, was, spoiled, in, 2020, this, led, to, an, idaho, company, planning, to, launch, gene, edited, strawberries, in, the, near, future, in, an, effort, to, make, them, more, durable, in, the, u, s, as, of, 2021, it, cost, growers, around, 35, 000, per, acre, to, plant, and, 35, 000, per, acre, to, harvest, strawberries, with, more, durable, berries, potentially, reducing, the, rate, of, spoilage, for, purposes, of, commercial, production, plants, are, propagated, from, runners, and, in, general, distributed, as, either, bare, root, plants, or, plugs, cultivation, follows, one, of, two, general, models, annual, plasticulture, or, a, perennial, system, of, matted, rows, or, mounds, greenhouses, produce, a, small, amount, of, strawberries, during, the, off, season, the, bulk, of, modern, commercial, production, uses, the, plasticulture, system, in, this, method, raised, beds, are, formed, each, year, fumigated, and, covered, with, plastic, to, prevent, weed, growth, and, erosion, plants, usually, obtained, from, northern, nurseries, are, planted, through, holes, punched, in, this, covering, and, irrigation, tubing, is, run, underneath, runners, are, removed, from, the, plants, as, they, appear, to, encourage, the, plants, to, put, most, of, their, energy, into, fruit, development, after, harvesting, the, plastic, is, removed, and, the, plants, are, plowed, into, the, ground, strawberry, plants, produce, more, and, better, fruit, when, they, are, young, after, a, year, or, two, they, decline, replacing, them, annually, improves, yields, and, enables, denser, planting, however, this, necessitates, a, longer, growing, season, for, the, plants, to, establish, themselves, it, also, costs, more, to, annually, purchase, plants, form, new, mounds, and, cover, them, with, new, plastic, the, other, major, method, retains, plants, for, multiple, years, this, is, most, common, in, colder, climates, the, plants, are, grown, in, rows, or, on, mounds, this, method, requires, lower, investment, and, lower, maintenance, overall, yields, are, typically, lower, than, in, plasticulture, another, method, uses, a, compost, sock, plants, grown, in, compost, socks, have, been, shown, to, produce, significantly, more, flavonoids, anthocyanins, fructose, glucose, sucrose, malic, acid, and, citric, acid, than, fruit, produced, in, the, black, plastic, mulch, or, matted, row, systems, similar, results, in, an, earlier, study, conducted, by, usda, confirms, how, compost, plays, a, role, in, the, bioactive, qualities, of, two, strawberry, cultivars, strawberries, may, also, be, propagated, by, seed, though, this, is, primarily, a, hobby, activity, and, is, not, widely, practiced, commercially, a, few, seed, propagated, cultivars, have, been, developed, for, home, use, and, research, into, growing, from, seed, commercially, is, ongoing, seeds, achenes, are, acquired, either, via, commercial, seed, suppliers, or, by, collecting, and, saving, them, from, the, fruit, strawberries, can, also, be, grown, indoors, in, strawberry, pots, strawberries, will, not, grow, indoors, in, winter, unless, aided, by, a, combination, of, blue, and, red, led, lights, in, florida, winter, is, the, natural, growing, season, and, harvesting, begins, in, mid, november, the, kashubian, strawberry, truskawka, kaszubska, or, kasz, bsk, mal, na, is, the, first, polish, fruit, to, be, given, commercial, protection, under, eu, law, it, is, produced, in, kartuzy, ko, cierzyna, and, byt, w, counties, and, in, the, municipalities, of, przywidz, wejherowo, luzino, szemud, linia, czyce, and, cewice, in, kashubia, only, the, following, varieties, may, be, sold, as, kasz, bsk, mal, na, senga, sengana, elsanta, honeoye, that, have, been, graded, as, extra, or, class, i, most, strawberry, plants, are, now, fed, with, artificial, fertilizers, both, before, and, after, harvesting, and, often, before, planting, in, plasticulture, to, maintain, top, quality, berries, are, harvested, at, least, every, other, day, the, berries, are, picked, with, the, caps, still, attached, and, with, at, least, half, an, inch, of, stem, left, strawberries, need, to, remain, on, the, plant, to, fully, ripen, because, they, do, not, continue, to, ripen, after, being, picked, rotted, and, overripe, berries, are, removed, to, minimize, insect, and, disease, problems, the, berries, do, not, get, washed, until, just, before, consumption, soil, test, information, and, plant, analysis, results, are, used, to, determine, fertility, practices, nitrogen, fertilizer, is, needed, at, the, beginning, of, every, planting, year, there, are, normally, adequate, levels, of, phosphorus, and, potash, when, fields, have, been, fertilized, for, top, yields, to, provide, more, organic, matter, a, cover, crop, of, wheat, or, rye, is, planted, in, the, winter, before, planting, the, strawberries, strawberries, prefer, a, ph, from, 5, 5, to, 6, 5, so, lime, is, usually, not, applied, the, harvesting, and, cleaning, process, has, not, changed, substantially, over, time, as, they, are, delicate, strawberries, are, still, harvested, by, hand, grading, and, packing, often, occurs, in, the, field, rather, than, in, a, processing, facility, in, large, operations, strawberries, are, cleaned, by, means, of, water, streams, and, shaking, conveyor, belts, strawberries, are, popular, in, home, gardens, and, numerous, cultivars, have, been, selected, for, consumption, and, for, exhibition, purposes, the, following, cultivars, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, in, the, united, states, in, 2017, the, collective, commercial, production, of, strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and, blackberries, was, a, 6, billion, industry, dominated, by, the, california, growing, and, marketing, company, driscoll, s, in, 2017, strawberries, alone, were, a, 3, 5, billion, market, of, which, 82, was, for, fresh, fruit, to, increase, consumer, demand, in, the, 21st, century, commercial, producers, of, strawberries, cultivated, them, mainly, for, favorable, aroma, characteristics, similar, to, those, of, wild, strawberries, in, addition, to, having, large, size, heart, shape, glossy, red, exterior, firmness, and, slow, ripening, for, long, shelf, life, favorable, to, ship, by, ground, transportation, from, farms, to, stores, nationwide, for, consumption, within, two, weeks, of, harvest, in, us, and, canadian, grocery, stores, fresh, strawberries, are, typically, sold, in, plastic, clamshells, and, are, among, the, top, fresh, produce, items, in, grocery, revenues, one, marketing, analysis, identified, strawberries, and, other, berries, as, a, source, of, happiness, for, consumers, around, 200, species, of, pests, are, known, to, attack, strawberries, both, directly, and, indirectly, these, pests, include, slugs, moths, fruit, flies, chafers, strawberry, root, weevils, strawberry, thrips, strawberry, sap, beetles, strawberry, crown, moth, mites, aphids, and, others, the, caterpillars, of, a, number, of, species, of, lepidoptera, feed, on, strawberry, plants, for, example, the, ghost, moth, is, known, to, be, a, pest, of, the, strawberry, plant, the, strawberry, aphid, chaetosiphon, fragaefolii, is, a, bug, species, found, in, the, united, states, arizona, argentina, and, chile, it, is, a, vector, of, the, strawberry, mild, yellow, edge, virus, the, amounts, of, pesticides, required, for, industrial, production, of, strawberries, 300, pounds, 140, kg, in, california, per, acre, have, led, to, the, strawberry, leading, the, list, of, ewg, s, dirty, dozen, of, pesticide, contaminated, produce, strawberry, plants, can, fall, victim, to, a, number, of, diseases, especially, when, subjected, to, stress, the, leaves, may, be, infected, by, powdery, mildew, leaf, spot, caused, by, the, fungus, sphaerella, fragariae, leaf, blight, caused, by, the, fungus, phomopsis, obscurans, and, by, a, variety, of, slime, molds, the, crown, and, roots, may, fall, victim, to, red, stele, verticillium, wilt, black, root, rot, and, nematodes, the, fruits, are, subject, to, damage, from, gray, mold, botrytis, cinerea, rhizopus, rot, and, leather, rot, to, prevent, root, rotting, strawberries, should, be, planted, every, four, to, five, years, in, a, new, bed, at, a, different, site, the, npr1, gene, from, arabidopsis, thaliana, atnpr1, confers, a, thaliana, s, broad, spectrum, resistance, when, transexpressed, in, f, ananassa, this, resistance, includes,
