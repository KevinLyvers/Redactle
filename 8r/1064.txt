chili, peppers, also, spelled, chile, or, chilli, from, classical, nahuatl, ch, lli, are, varieties, of, the, berry, fruit, of, plants, from, the, genus, capsicum, which, are, members, of, the, nightshade, family, solanaceae, cultivated, for, their, pungency, chili, peppers, are, widely, used, in, many, cuisines, as, a, spice, to, add, heat, to, dishes, capsaicin, and, related, compounds, known, as, capsaicinoids, are, the, substances, that, give, chili, peppers, their, intensity, when, ingested, or, applied, topically, chili, peppers, exhibit, a, range, of, heat, and, flavors, this, diversity, is, the, reason, behind, the, availability, of, different, types, of, paprika, and, chili, powder, each, offering, its, own, taste, and, heat, level, chili, peppers, are, believed, to, have, originated, in, central, or, south, america, and, were, first, cultivated, in, mexico, european, explorers, brought, chili, peppers, back, to, the, old, world, in, the, late, 16th, century, as, part, of, the, columbian, exchange, which, led, to, the, cultivation, of, multiple, varieties, across, the, world, for, food, and, traditional, medicine, five, capsicum, species, have, been, widely, cultivated, annuum, baccatum, chinense, frutescens, and, pubescens, in, 2019, the, world, s, production, of, raw, green, chili, peppers, amounted, to, 38, million, tons, with, china, producing, half, capsicum, plants, originated, in, modern, day, peru, and, bolivia, and, have, been, a, part, of, human, diets, since, about, 7, 500, bc, they, are, one, of, the, oldest, cultivated, crops, in, the, americas, origins, of, cultivating, chili, peppers, have, been, traced, to, east, central, mexico, some, 6, 000, years, ago, although, according, to, researchers, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, in, 2014, chili, plants, were, first, cultivated, independently, across, different, locations, in, the, americas, including, highland, peru, and, bolivia, central, mexico, and, the, amazon, they, were, one, of, the, first, self, pollinating, crops, cultivated, in, mexico, central, america, and, parts, of, south, america, peru, has, the, highest, variety, of, cultivated, capsicum, diversity, because, it, is, a, center, of, diversification, where, varieties, of, all, five, domesticates, were, introduced, grown, and, consumed, in, pre, columbian, times, the, largest, diversity, of, wild, capsicum, peppers, is, consumed, in, bolivia, bolivian, consumers, distinguish, two, basic, forms, ulupicas, species, with, small, round, fruits, including, c, eximium, c, cardenasii, c, eshbaughii, and, c, caballeroi, landraces, and, arivivis, with, small, elongated, fruits, including, c, baccatum, var, baccatum, and, c, chacoense, varieties, when, christopher, columbus, and, his, crew, reached, the, caribbean, they, were, the, first, europeans, to, encounter, capsicum, they, called, the, fruits, peppers, because, like, black, pepper, piper, nigrum, which, had, long, been, known, in, europe, they, have, a, spicy, hot, taste, unlike, other, foods, chilies, were, first, brought, back, to, europe, by, the, spanish, who, financed, columbus, s, voyages, appearing, in, spanish, records, by, 1493, unlike, true, pepper, vines, of, genus, piper, which, grow, naturally, only, in, the, tropics, chilies, could, be, grown, in, temperate, climates, by, the, mid, 1500s, they, had, become, a, common, garden, plant, in, spain, and, were, incorporated, into, numerous, dishes, by, 1526, they, also, appeared, in, italy, in, 1543, in, germany, and, by, 1569, in, the, balkans, where, they, came, to, be, processed, into, paprika, the, rapid, introduction, of, chilis, to, africa, and, asia, was, likely, through, the, portuguese, and, spanish, traders, in, the, 16th, century, though, the, details, are, unrecorded, the, portuguese, introduced, it, first, to, africa, and, arabia, and, then, to, their, colonies, and, trading, posts, in, asia, including, goa, sri, lanka, and, malacca, from, there, it, spread, to, neighboring, regions, in, south, asia, and, western, southeast, asia, via, local, trade, and, natural, dispersal, at, around, the, same, time, the, spanish, also, introduced, chilis, to, the, philippines, where, it, spread, to, melanesia, micronesia, and, other, pacific, islands, via, their, monopoly, of, the, manila, galleons, their, spread, to, east, asia, in, the, late, 16th, century, is, less, clear, but, was, likely, also, through, local, trade, or, through, portuguese, and, spanish, trading, ports, in, canton, china, and, nagasaki, japan, the, earliest, known, mention, of, the, chili, pepper, in, chinese, writing, dates, to, 1591, though, the, pepper, is, thought, to, have, entered, the, country, in, the, 1570s, in, 2020, 36, million, tonnes, of, green, chilies, and, peppers, counted, as, any, capsicum, or, pimenta, fruits, were, produced, worldwide, with, china, producing, 46, of, the, total, there, are, five, domesticated, species, of, chili, peppers, though, there, are, only, a, few, commonly, used, species, there, are, many, cultivars, and, methods, of, preparing, chili, peppers, that, have, different, names, for, culinary, use, green, and, red, bell, peppers, for, example, are, the, same, cultivar, of, c, annuum, unripe, peppers, are, green, although, peppers, that, do, not, turn, red, on, ripening, have, been, bred, in, the, same, species, are, the, jalape, o, the, poblano, which, when, dried, is, referred, to, as, ancho, new, mexico, serrano, and, other, cultivars, peppers, are, commonly, broken, down, into, two, groupings, bell, peppers, uk, sweet, peppers, and, hot, peppers, most, popular, pepper, varieties, are, seen, as, falling, into, one, of, these, categories, or, a, cross, between, them, the, substances, that, give, chili, peppers, their, pungency, spicy, heat, when, ingested, or, applied, topically, are, capsaicin, 8, methyl, n, vanillyl, 6, nonenamide, and, several, related, chemicals, collectively, called, capsaicinoids, the, quantity, of, capsaicin, varies, by, variety, and, depends, on, growing, conditions, water, stressed, peppers, usually, produce, stronger, pods, when, a, habanero, plant, is, stressed, by, absorbing, low, water, for, example, the, concentration, of, capsaicin, increases, in, some, parts, of, the, fruit, when, peppers, are, consumed, by, mammals, such, as, humans, capsaicin, binds, with, pain, receptors, in, the, mouth, and, throat, potentially, evoking, pain, via, spinal, relays, to, the, brainstem, and, thalamus, where, heat, and, discomfort, are, perceived, however, birds, are, unable, to, perceive, the, hotness, and, so, they, can, eat, some, of, the, hottest, peppers, the, intensity, of, the, heat, of, chili, peppers, is, commonly, reported, in, scoville, heat, units, shu, invented, by, american, pharmacist, wilbur, scoville, in, 1912, historically, it, was, a, measure, of, the, dilution, of, an, amount, of, chili, extract, added, to, sugar, syrup, before, its, heat, becomes, undetectable, to, a, panel, of, tasters, the, more, it, has, to, be, diluted, to, be, undetectable, the, more, powerful, the, variety, and, therefore, the, higher, the, rating, the, modern, method, is, a, quantitative, analysis, of, shu, using, high, performance, liquid, chromatography, hplc, to, directly, measure, the, capsaicinoid, content, of, a, chili, pepper, variety, pure, capsaicin, is, a, hydrophobic, colorless, odorless, and, crystalline, to, waxy, solid, at, room, temperature, and, measures, 16, 000, 000, shu, capsaicin, is, produced, by, the, plant, as, a, defense, against, mammalian, predators, and, microbes, in, particular, a, fusarium, fungus, carried, by, hemipteran, insects, that, attack, certain, species, of, chili, peppers, according, to, one, study, peppers, increased, the, quantity, of, capsaicin, in, proportion, to, the, damage, caused, by, fungal, predation, on, the, plant, s, seeds, a, wide, range, of, intensity, is, found, in, commonly, used, peppers, the, top, 8, world, s, hottest, chili, peppers, by, country, are, note, shu, claims, marked, with, an, asterisk, have, not, been, confirmed, by, guinness, world, records, due, to, their, unique, pungency, chili, peppers, constitute, a, crucial, part, of, many, cuisines, around, the, world, particularly, in, chinese, especially, in, sichuanese, food, mexican, thai, indian, new, mexican, cuisine, and, many, other, south, american, caribbean, and, east, asian, cuisines, in, 21st, century, asian, cuisine, chili, peppers, are, commonly, used, across, many, regions, chili, pepper, pods, are, botanically, berries, when, used, fresh, they, are, most, often, prepared, and, eaten, like, a, vegetable, whole, pods, can, be, dried, and, then, crushed, or, ground, into, chili, powder, that, is, used, as, a, spice, or, seasoning, chilies, can, be, dried, to, prolong, their, shelf, life, chili, peppers, can, also, be, preserved, by, brining, immersing, the, pods, in, oil, or, by, pickling, many, fresh, chilies, such, as, poblano, have, a, tough, outer, skin, that, does, not, break, down, on, cooking, chilies, are, sometimes, used, whole, or, in, large, slices, by, roasting, or, other, means, of, blistering, or, charring, the, skin, so, as, not, to, entirely, cook, the, flesh, beneath, when, cooled, the, skins, will, usually, slip, off, easily, the, leaves, of, every, species, of, capsicum, are, edible, though, almost, all, other, solanaceous, crops, have, toxins, in, their, leaves, chili, peppers, do, not, the, leaves, which, are, mildly, bitter, and, nowhere, near, as, hot, as, the, fruit, are, cooked, as, greens, in, filipino, cuisine, where, they, are, called, dahon, ng, sili, literally, chili, leaves, they, are, used, in, the, chicken, soup, tinola, in, korean, cuisine, the, leaves, may, be, used, in, kimchi, in, japanese, cuisine, the, leaves, are, cooked, as, greens, and, also, cooked, in, tsukudani, style, for, preservation, many, mexican, dishes, including, variations, on, chiles, rellenos, use, the, entire, chili, dried, whole, chilies, may, be, reconstituted, before, grinding, to, a, paste, the, chipotle, is, the, smoked, dried, ripe, jalape, o, in, the, northern, mexican, states, of, sinaloa, and, sonora, chiltepin, peppers, a, wild, pepper, are, used, in, cheeses, and, soups, to, add, spiciness, to, dishes, in, southern, mexico, mole, sauce, is, made, with, dried, chiles, such, as, ancho, and, chipotle, peppers, chiles, are, used, in, salsas, mexican, households, usually, grow, chile, plants, to, use, in, cooking, in, india, most, households, always, keep, a, stock, of, fresh, hot, green, chilies, at, hand, and, use, them, to, flavor, most, curries, and, dry, dishes, chili, is, a, staple, fruit, in, bhutan, bhutanese, call, this, crop, ema, in, dzongkha, or, solo, in, sharchop, the, ema, datshi, recipe, is, entirely, made, of, chili, mixed, with, local, cheese, chilies, are, present, in, many, cuisines, some, notable, chili, dishes, include, arrabbiata, sauce, paprikash, chiles, en, nogada, jerk, chicken, mole, poblano, nam, phrik, nduja, sambal, and, som, tam, fresh, or, dried, chilies, are, often, used, to, make, hot, sauce, a, liquid, condiment, usually, bottled, when, commercially, available, that, adds, spice, to, other, dishes, hot, sauces, are, found, in, many, cuisines, including, harissa, from, north, africa, chili, oil, from, china, known, as, r, yu, in, japan, and, sriracha, from, thailand, dried, chilies, are, also, used, to, infuse, cooking, oil, the, contrast, in, color, and, appearance, makes, chili, plants, interesting, to, some, as, a, purely, decorative, garden, plant, psychologist, paul, rozin, suggests, that, eating, chilies, is, an, example, of, a, constrained, risk, like, riding, a, roller, coaster, in, which, extreme, sensations, like, pain, and, fear, can, be, enjoyed, because, individuals, know, that, these, sensations, are, not, actually, harmful, this, method, lets, people, experience, extreme, feelings, without, any, significant, risk, of, bodily, harm, capsaicin, the, pungent, chemical, in, chili, peppers, is, used, as, an, analgesic, in, topical, ointments, nasal, sprays, and, dermal, patches, to, relieve, pain, a, 2022, review, of, preliminary, research, indicated, that, regular, consumption, of, chili, peppers, was, associated, with, weak, evidence, for, a, lower, risk, of, death, from, cardiovascular, diseases, and, cancer, capsaicin, extracted, from, chilies, is, used, in, pepper, sprays, and, some, tear, gas, formulations, as, a, chemical, irritant, for, use, as, less, lethal, weapons, for, control, of, unruly, individuals, or, crowds, such, products, have, considerable, potential, for, misuse, and, may, cause, injury, or, death, conflicts, between, farmers, and, elephants, have, long, been, widespread, in, african, and, asian, countries, where, elephants, nightly, destroy, crops, raid, grain, houses, and, sometimes, kill, people, farmers, have, found, the, use, of, chilies, effective, in, crop, defense, against, elephants, elephants, do, not, like, capsaicin, because, the, elephants, have, a, large, and, sensitive, olfactory, and, nasal, system, the, smell, of, the, chili, causes, them, discomfort, and, deters, them, from, feeding, on, the, crops, by, planting, a, few, rows, of, the, fruit, around, valuable, crops, farmers, create, a, buffer, zone, through, which, the, elephants, are, reluctant, to, pass, chili, dung, bombs, are, also, used, for, this, purpose, they, are, bricks, made, of, mixing, dung, and, chili, and, are, burned, creating, a, noxious, smoke, that, keeps, hungry, elephants, out, of, farmers, fields, this, can, lessen, dangerous, physical, confrontation, between, people, and, elephants, birds, do, not, have, the, same, sensitivity, to, capsaicin, because, it, targets, a, specific, pain, receptor, in, mammals, chili, peppers, are, eaten, by, birds, living, in, the, chili, peppers, natural, range, possibly, contributing, to, seed, dispersal, and, evolution, of, the, protective, capsaicin, in, chili, peppers, as, a, bird, in, flight, can, spread, the, seeds, further, away, from, the, parent, plant, after, they, pass, through, its, digestive, system, than, any,
