stegosaurus, s, t, s, r, s, lit, roof, lizard, is, a, genus, of, herbivorous, four, legged, armored, dinosaur, from, the, late, jurassic, characterized, by, the, distinctive, kite, shaped, upright, plates, along, their, backs, and, spikes, on, their, tails, fossils, of, the, genus, have, been, found, in, the, western, united, states, and, in, portugal, where, they, are, found, in, kimmeridgian, to, tithonian, aged, strata, dating, to, between, 155, and, 145, million, years, ago, of, the, species, that, have, been, classified, in, the, upper, morrison, formation, of, the, western, us, only, three, are, universally, recognized, s, stenops, s, ungulatus, and, s, sulcatus, the, remains, of, over, 80, individual, animals, of, this, genus, have, been, found, stegosaurus, would, have, lived, alongside, dinosaurs, such, as, apatosaurus, diplodocus, camarasaurus, and, allosaurus, the, latter, of, which, may, have, preyed, on, it, they, were, large, heavily, built, herbivorous, quadrupeds, with, rounded, backs, short, fore, limbs, long, hind, limbs, and, tails, held, high, in, the, air, due, to, their, distinctive, combination, of, broad, upright, plates, and, tail, tipped, with, spikes, stegosaurus, is, one, of, the, most, recognizable, kinds, of, dinosaurs, the, function, of, this, array, of, plates, and, spikes, has, been, the, subject, of, much, speculation, among, scientists, today, it, is, generally, agreed, that, their, spiked, tails, were, most, likely, used, for, defense, against, predators, while, their, plates, may, have, been, used, primarily, for, display, and, secondarily, for, thermoregulatory, functions, stegosaurus, had, a, relatively, low, brain, to, body, mass, ratio, it, had, a, short, neck, and, a, small, head, meaning, it, most, likely, ate, low, lying, bushes, and, shrubs, one, species, stegosaurus, ungulatus, is, one, of, the, largest, known, of, all, the, stegosaurians, with, the, largest, known, specimens, measuring, about, 7, 5, metres, 25, ft, long, and, weighing, over, 5, metric, tons, 5, 5, short, tons, stegosaurus, remains, were, first, identified, during, the, bone, wars, by, othniel, charles, marsh, at, dinosaur, ridge, national, landmark, the, first, known, skeletons, were, fragmentary, and, the, bones, were, scattered, and, it, would, be, many, years, before, the, true, appearance, of, these, animals, including, their, posture, and, plate, arrangement, became, well, understood, despite, its, popularity, in, books, and, film, mounted, skeletons, of, stegosaurus, did, not, become, a, staple, of, major, natural, history, museums, until, the, mid, 20th, century, and, many, museums, have, had, to, assemble, composite, displays, from, several, different, specimens, due, to, a, lack, of, complete, skeletons, stegosaurus, is, one, of, the, better, known, dinosaurs, and, has, been, featured, in, film, on, postal, stamps, and, in, many, other, types, of, media, stegosaurus, one, of, the, many, dinosaurs, described, in, the, bone, wars, was, first, collected, by, arthur, lakes, and, consisted, of, several, caudal, vertebrae, a, dermal, plate, and, several, additional, postcranial, elements, that, were, collected, north, of, morrison, colorado, at, lakes, ypm, quarry, 5, these, first, fragmented, bones, ypm, 1850, became, the, holotype, of, stegosaurus, armatus, when, yale, paleontologist, othniel, charles, marsh, described, them, in, 1877, marsh, initially, believed, the, remains, were, from, an, aquatic, turtle, like, animal, and, the, basis, for, its, scientific, name, roof, ed, lizard, was, due, to, his, early, belief, that, the, plates, lay, flat, over, the, animal, s, back, overlapping, like, the, shingles, tiles, on, a, roof, though, several, more, complete, specimens, have, been, attributed, to, stegosaurus, armatus, preparation, of, the, bones, and, analysis, has, discovered, that, this, type, specimen, is, actually, dubious, which, is, not, an, ideal, situation, for, the, type, species, of, a, well, known, genus, like, stegosaurus, because, of, this, the, international, code, of, zoological, nomenclature, decided, to, replace, the, type, species, with, the, more, well, known, species, stegosaurus, stenops, marsh, also, incorrectly, referred, several, fossils, to, s, armatus, including, the, dentary, and, teeth, of, the, sauropod, diplodocus, and, putting, sauropod, limb, bones, and, an, allosaurus, tibia, under, ypm, 1850, on, the, other, side, of, the, bone, wars, edward, drinker, cope, named, hypsirhophus, discurus, as, another, stegosaurian, based, on, fragmentary, fossils, from, cope, s, quarry, 3, near, the, cope, s, nipple, site, in, garden, park, colorado, in, 1878, many, later, researchers, have, considered, hypsirhophus, to, be, a, synonym, of, stegosaurus, though, peter, galton, 2010, suggested, that, it, is, distinct, based, on, differences, in, the, vertebrae, f, f, hubbell, a, collector, for, cope, also, found, a, partial, stegosaurus, skeleton, while, digging, at, como, bluff, in, 1877, or, 78, that, are, now, part, of, the, stegosaurus, mount, amnh, 5752, at, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, arthur, lakes, made, another, discovery, later, in, 1879, at, como, bluff, in, albany, county, wyoming, the, site, also, dating, to, the, upper, jurassic, of, the, morrison, formation, when, he, found, several, large, stegosaurus, fossils, in, august, of, that, year, the, majority, of, the, fossils, came, from, quarry, 13, including, the, type, specimen, of, stegosaurus, ungulatus, ypm, 1853, which, was, collected, by, lakes, and, william, harlow, reed, the, same, year, and, named, by, marsh, the, specimen, was, one, of, many, found, at, the, quarry, the, specimen, consisting, of, a, partial, skull, several, vertebrae, an, ischium, partial, limbs, several, plates, and, four, thagomizers, though, eight, thagomizers, were, referred, based, on, a, specimen, preserved, alongside, the, type, the, type, specimen, also, preserved, the, pes, which, was, the, namesake, of, the, species, meaning, hoofed, roofed, lizard, in, 1881, he, named, a, third, species, stegosaurus, affinis, based, only, on, a, hip, bone, though, the, fossil, has, since, been, lost, and, the, species, declared, a, nomen, nudum, later, in, 1887, marsh, described, two, more, species, of, stegosaurus, from, como, bluff, stegosaurus, duplex, based, on, a, partial, vertebral, column, partial, pelvis, and, partial, left, hindlimb, ypm, 1858, from, reed, s, quarry, 11, though, the, species, is, now, seen, as, synonymous, with, stegosaurus, ungulatus, the, other, stegosaurus, sulcatus, was, named, based, on, a, left, forelimb, scapula, left, femur, several, vertebrae, and, several, plates, and, dermal, armor, elements, usnm, v, 4937, collected, in, 1883, stegosaurus, sulcatus, most, notably, preserves, a, large, spike, that, has, been, speculated, to, have, been, a, shoulder, spike, that, is, used, to, diagnose, the, species, the, greatest, stegosaurus, discovery, came, in, 1885, with, the, discovery, of, a, nearly, complete, articulated, skeleton, of, a, subadult, that, included, previously, undiscovered, elements, like, a, complete, skull, throat, ossicles, and, articulated, plates, marshall, p, felch, collected, the, skeleton, throughout, 1885, and, 1886, from, morrison, formation, strata, at, his, quarry, in, garden, park, a, town, near, ca, on, city, colorado, the, skeleton, was, expertly, unearthed, by, felch, who, first, divided, the, skeleton, into, labeled, blocks, and, prepared, them, separately, the, skeleton, was, shipped, to, marsh, in, 1887, who, named, it, stegosaurus, stenops, narrow, faced, roof, lizard, that, year, though, it, had, not, yet, been, completely, prepared, the, nearly, complete, and, articulated, type, specimen, of, stegosaurus, stenops, allowed, marsh, to, complete, the, first, attempt, at, a, reconstructed, stegosaurus, skeleton, this, first, reconstruction, of, s, ungulatus, with, missing, parts, filled, in, from, s, stenops, was, published, by, marsh, in, 1891, in, 1893, richard, lydekker, mistakenly, re, published, marsh, s, drawing, under, the, label, hypsirhophus, the, skeleton, of, s, stenops, has, since, been, deposited, at, the, national, museum, of, natural, history, in, washington, d, c, where, it, has, been, on, display, since, 1915, another, mount, was, made, for, the, nmnh, in, the, form, of, a, mounted, composite, skeleton, consisting, of, several, specimens, referred, to, s, stenops, that, were, collected, at, quarry, 13, at, como, bluff, in, 1887, the, most, complete, being, usnm, 6531, the, type, specimen, of, s, ungulatus, ypm, 1853, was, incorporated, into, the, first, ever, mounted, skeleton, of, a, stegosaur, at, the, peabody, museum, of, natural, history, in, 1910, by, richard, swann, lull, it, was, initially, mounted, with, paired, plates, set, wide, above, the, base, of, the, ribs, but, was, remounted, in, 1924, with, two, staggered, rows, of, plates, along, the, midline, of, the, back, additional, specimens, recovered, from, the, same, quarry, by, the, united, states, national, museum, of, natural, history, including, tail, vertebrae, and, an, additional, large, plate, usnm, 7414, belong, to, the, same, individual, as, ypm, 1853, the, next, species, of, stegosaurus, to, be, named, was, s, marshi, by, frederick, lucas, in, 1901, lucas, reclassified, this, species, in, the, new, genus, hoplitosaurus, later, that, year, lucas, also, re, examined, the, issue, of, the, life, appearance, of, stegosaurus, coming, to, the, conclusion, that, the, plates, were, arranged, in, pairs, in, two, rows, along, the, back, arranged, above, the, bases, of, the, ribs, lucas, commissioned, charles, r, knight, to, produce, a, life, restoration, of, s, ungulatus, based, on, his, new, interpretation, however, the, following, year, lucas, wrote, that, he, now, believed, the, plates, were, probably, attached, in, staggered, rows, in, 1910, richard, swann, lull, wrote, that, the, alternating, pattern, seen, in, s, stenops, was, probably, due, to, shifting, of, the, skeleton, after, death, he, led, the, construction, of, the, first, ever, stegosaurus, skeletal, mount, at, the, peabody, museum, of, natural, history, which, was, depicted, with, paired, plates, in, 1914, charles, gilmore, argued, against, lull, s, interpretation, noting, that, several, specimens, of, s, stenops, including, the, now, completely, prepared, holotype, preserved, the, plates, in, alternating, rows, near, the, peak, of, the, back, and, that, there, was, no, evidence, of, the, plates, having, shifted, relative, to, the, body, during, fossilization, gilmore, and, lucas, interpretation, became, the, generally, accepted, standard, and, lull, s, mount, at, the, peabody, museum, was, changed, to, reflect, this, in, 1924, though, considered, one, of, the, most, distinctive, types, of, dinosaur, stegosaurus, displays, were, missing, from, a, majority, of, museums, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, due, largely, to, the, disarticulated, nature, of, most, fossil, specimens, until, 1918, the, only, mounted, skeleton, of, stegosaurus, in, the, world, was, o, c, marsh, s, type, specimen, of, s, ungulatus, at, the, peabody, museum, of, natural, history, which, was, put, on, display, in, 1910, however, this, mount, was, dismantled, in, 1917, when, the, old, peabody, museum, building, was, demolished, this, historically, significant, specimen, was, re, mounted, ahead, of, the, opening, of, the, new, peabody, museum, building, in, 1925, 1918, saw, the, completion, of, the, second, stegosaurus, mount, and, the, first, depicting, s, stenops, this, mount, was, created, under, the, direction, of, charles, gilmore, at, the, u, s, national, museum, of, natural, history, it, was, a, composite, of, several, skeletons, primarily, usnm, 6531, with, proportions, designed, to, closely, follow, the, s, stenops, type, specimen, which, had, been, on, display, in, relief, nearby, since, 1918, the, aging, mount, was, dismantled, in, 2003, and, replaced, with, a, cast, in, an, updated, pose, in, 2004, a, third, mounted, skeleton, of, stegosaurus, referred, to, s, stenops, was, put, on, display, at, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, in, 1932, mounted, under, the, direction, of, charles, j, long, the, american, museum, mount, was, a, composite, consisting, of, partial, remains, filled, in, with, replicas, based, on, other, specimens, in, his, article, about, the, new, mount, for, the, museum, s, journal, barnum, brown, described, and, disputed, the, popular, misconception, that, the, stegosaurus, had, a, second, brain, in, its, hips, another, composite, mount, using, specimens, referred, to, s, ungulatus, collected, from, dinosaur, national, monument, between, 1920, and, 1922, was, put, on, display, at, the, carnegie, museum, of, natural, history, in, 1940, one, of, the, major, subjects, of, books, and, articles, about, stegosaurus, is, the, plate, arrangement, the, argument, has, been, a, major, one, in, the, history, of, dinosaur, reconstruction, four, possible, plate, arrangements, have, been, proposed, over, the, years, after, the, end, of, the, bone, wars, many, major, institutions, in, the, eastern, united, states, were, inspired, by, the, depictions, and, finds, by, marsh, and, cope, to, assemble, their, own, dinosaur, fossil, collections, the, competition, was, foremost, started, by, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, the, carnegie, museum, of, natural, history, and, the, field, museum, of, natural, history, which, all, sent, expeditions, to, the, west, to, make, their, own, dinosaur, collections, and, mount, skeletons, in, their, fossil, halls, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, was, the, first, to, launch, an, expedition, in, 1897, finding, several, assorted, but, incomplete, stegosaurus, specimens, at, bone, cabin, quarry, in, como, bluff, these, remains, haven, t, been, described, and, were, mounted, in, 1932, the, mount, being, a, composite, primarily, of, specimens, amnh, 650, 470, from, bone, cabin, quarry, the, amnh, mount, is, cast, and, on, display, at, the, field, museum, which, didn, t, collect, any, stegosaurus, skeletons, during, the, second, dinosaur, rush, the, carnegie, museum, in, pittsburgh, on, the, other, hand, collected, many, stegosaurus, specimens, first, at, freezout, hills, in, carbon, county, wyoming, in, 1902, 03, the, fossils, included, only, a, couple, postcranial, remains, though, in, the, 1900s, 1920s, carnegie, crews, at, dinosaur, national, monument, discovered, dozens, of, stegosaurus, specimens, in, one, of, the, greatest, single, sites, for, the, taxon, cm, 11341, the, most, complete, skeleton, found, at, the, quarry, was, used, for, the, basis, of, a, composite, stegosaurus, mount, in, 1940, along, with, several, other, specimens, to, finish, the, mount, a, cranium, cm, 12000, was, also, found, by, carnegie, crews, one, of, the, few, known, both, the, amnh, and, cm, material, has, been, referred, to, stegosaurus, ungulatus, as, part, of, the, dinosaur, renaissance, and, the, resurgent, interest, in, dinosaurs, by, museums, and, the, public, fossils, of, stegosaurus, were, once, again, being, collected, though, few, have, been, fully, described, an, important, discovery, came, in, 1937, again, at, garden, park, by, a, high, school, teacher, named, frank, kessler, in, while, leading, a, nature, hike, kessler, contacted, the, denver, museum, of, nature, and, science, who, sent, paleontologist, robert, landberg, landberg, excavated, the, skeleton, with, the, dmns, crews, recovering, a, 70, complete, stegosaurus, skeleton, along, with, turtles, crocodiles, and, isolated, dinosaur, fossils, at, the, quarry, that, would, be, nicknamed, the, kessler, site, phillip, reinheimer, a, steel, worker, mounted, the, stegosaurus, skeleton, at, the, dmns, in, 1938, the, skeleton, remained, mounted, until, 1989, when, the, museum, curator, of, the, dmns, began, a, revision, of, the, museum, s, fossil, hall, and, dispatched, an, expedition, to, find, additional, stegosaurus, remains, the, expedition, was, successful, in, finding, a, nearly, complete, stegosaurus, near, the, kessler, site, by, bryan, small, who, would, become, the, eponym, of, the, new, site, the, small, quarry, stegosaurus, articulation, and, completeness, clarified, the, position, of, plates, and, spikes, on, the, back, of, stegosaurus, and, the, position, and, size, of, the, throat, ossicles, found, earlier, first, by, felch, with, the, stegosaurus, stenops, holotype, though, like, the, s, stenops, type, the, fossils, were, flattened, in, a, roadkill, condition, the, stegosaurus, skeletons, have, been, mounted, alongside, an, allosaurus, skeleton, collected, in, moffat, county, colorado, originally, in, 1979, 1987, saw, the, discovery, of, a, 40, complete, stegosaurus, skeleton, in, rabbit, valley, in, mesa, county, colorado, by, harold, bollan, near, the, dinosaur, journey, museum, the, skeleton, was, nicknamed, the, bollan, stegosaurus, and, is, in, the, collections, of, the, dinosaur, journey, museum, at, jensen, jensen, quarry, an, articulated, torso, including, several, dorsal, plates, from, a, small, individual, were, collected, and, briefly, described, in, 2014, though, the, specimen, was, collected, years, before, and, is, still, in, preparation, at, brigham, young, university, 2007, saw, the, description, of, a, stegosaurus, specimen, from, the, upper, jurassic, lourinha, formation, of, portugal, the, specimen, was, placed, as, cf, stegosaurus, ungulatus, by, the, describers, the, specimen, is, one, of, the, few, associated, stegosaurus, skeletons, known, though, it, only, contains, a, tooth, 13, vertebrae, partial, limbs, a, cervical, plate, and, several, assorted, postcranial, elements, sophie, the, stegosaurus, is, the, best, preserved, stegosaurus, specimen, being, 85, intact, and, containing, 360, bones, sophie, was, first, discovered, by, bob, simon, in, 2003, at, a, quarry, on, the, red, canyon, ranch, near, shell, wyoming, and, was, excavated, by, crews, from, the, swiss, sauriermuseum, in, 2004, and, later, prepared, by, museum, staff, who, gave, it, the, nickname, sarah, after, the, landowner, s, daughter, the, skeleton, had, been, excavated, on, private, land, and, was, available, for, purchase, the, natural, history, museum, london, worked, with, private, donors, most, notably, jeremy, herrmann, to, find, the, funding, and, then, arranged, to, purchase, the, specimen, which, was, given, the, new, official, museum, collection, specimen, designation, nhmuk, pv, r36730, and, re, nicknamed, sophie, after, jeremy, herrmann, s, daughter, the, mounted, skeleton, went, on, display, in, december, 2014, and, was, scientifically, described, in, 2015, it, is, a, young, adult, of, undetermined, sex, 5, 8, m, 19, ft, long, and, 2, 9, m, 9, 5, ft, tall, the, sauriermuseum, found, several, partial, stegosaurid, skeletons, throughout, their, excavations, at, howe, quarry, wyoming, in, the, 1990s, though, only, sophie, has, been, described, in, detail, one, skeleton, collected, at, the, site, known, as, victoria, is, very, well, preserved, including, many, of, the, vertebrae, preserved, in, semi, articulation, and, next, to, an, allosaurus, skeleton, found, nicknamed, big, al, ii, the, quadrupedal, stegosaurus, is, one, of, the, most, easily, identifiable, dinosaur, genera, due, to, the, distinctive, double, row, of, kite, shaped, plates, rising, vertically, along, the, rounded, back, and, the, two, pairs, of, long, spikes, extending, horizontally, near, the, end, of, the, tail, s, stenops, reached, 6, 5, m, 21, 3, ft, in, length, and, 3, 5, metric, tons, 3, 9, short, tons, in, body, mass, while, s, ungulatus, reached, 7, m, 23, 0, ft, in, length, and, 3, 8, metric, tons, 4, 2, short, tons, in, body, mass, some, large, individuals, may, have, reached, 7, 5, m, 25, ft, in, length, and, 5, 0, 5, 3, metric, tons, 5, 5, 5, 8, short, tons, in, body, mass, most, of, the, information, known, about, stegosaurus, comes, from, the, remains, of, mature, animals, more, recently, though, juvenile, remains, of, stegosaurus, have, been, found, one, subadult, specimen, discovered, in, 1994, in, wyoming, is, 4, 6, m, 15, 1, ft, long, and, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, high, and, is, estimated, to, have, weighed, 1, 5, 2, 2, metric, tons, 1, 6, 2, 4, short, tons, while, alive, it, is, on, display, in, the, university, of, wyoming, geological, museum, the, long, and, narrow, skull, was, small, in, proportion, to, the, body, it, had, a, small, antorbital, fenestra, the, hole, between, the, nose, and, eye, common, to, most, archosaurs, including, modern, birds, though, lost, in, extant, crocodylians, the, skull, s, low, position, suggests, that, stegosaurus, may, have, been, a, browser, of, low, growing, vegetation, this, interpretation, is, supported, by, the, absence, of, front, teeth, and, their, likely, replacement, by, a, horny, beak, or, rhamphotheca, the, lower, jaw, had, flat, downward, and, upward, extensions, that, would, have, completely, hidden, the, teeth, when, viewed, from, the, side, and, these, probably, supported, a, turtle, like, beak, in, life, the, presence, of, a, beak, extended, along, much, of, the, jaws, may, have, precluded, the, presence, of, cheeks, in, these, species, such, an, extensive, beak, was, probably, unique, to, stegosaurus, and, some, other, advanced, stegosaurids, among, ornithischians, which, usually, had, beaks, restricted, to, the, jaw, tips, other, researchers, have, interpreted, these, ridges, as, modified, versions, of, similar, structures, in, other, ornithischians, which, might, have, supported, fleshy, cheeks, rather, than, beaks, stegosaurian, teeth, were, small, triangular, and, flat, wear, facets, show, that, they, did, grind, their, food, despite, the, animal, s, overall, size, the, braincase, of, stegosaurus, was, small, being, no, larger, than, that, of, a, dog, a, well, preserved, stegosaurus, braincase, allowed, othniel, charles, marsh, to, obtain, in, the, 1880s, a, cast, of, the, brain, cavity, or, endocast, of, the, animal, which, gave, an, indication, of, the, brain, size, the, endocast, showed, the, brain, was, indeed, very, small, the, smallest, proportionally, of, all, dinosaur, endocasts, then, known, the, fact, that, an, animal, weighing, over, 4, 5, metric, tons, 5, short, tons, could, have, a, brain, of, no, more, than, 80, g, 2, 8, oz, contributed, to, the, popular, old, idea, that, all, dinosaurs, were, unintelligent, an, idea, now, largely, rejected, actual, brain, anatomy, in, stegosaurus, is, poorly, known, but, the, brain, itself, was, small, even, for, a, dinosaur, in, stegosaurus, stenops, there, are, 27, bones, in, the, vertebral, column, anterior, to, the, sacrum, a, varying, number, of, vertebrae, in, the, sacrum, with, four, in, most, subadults, and, around, 46, caudal, tail, vertebrae, the, presacrals, are, divided, into, cervical, neck, and, dorsal, back, vertebrae, with, around, 10, cervicals, and, 17, dorsals, the, total, number, being, one, greater, than, in, hesperosaurus, two, greater, than, huayangosaurus, although, miragaia, preserves, 17, cervicals, and, an, unknown, number, of, dorsals, the, first, cervical, vertebra, is, the, axis, bone, which, is, connected, and, often, fused, to, the, atlas, bone, farther, posteriorly, the, proportionately, larger, the, cervicals, become, although, they, do, not, change, greatly, in, anything, other, than, size, past, the, first, few, dorsals, the, centrum, of, the, bones, become, more, elongate, front, to, back, and, the, transverse, processes, become, more, elevated, dorsal, the, sacrum, of, s, stenops, includes, four, sacral, vertebrae, but, one, of, the, dorsals, is, also, incorporated, into, the, structure, in, some, specimens, of, s, stenops, a, caudal, is, also, incorporated, as, a, caudosacral, in, hesperosaurus, there, are, two, dorsosacrals, and, only, four, fused, sacrals, but, in, kentrosaurus, there, may, be, as, many, as, seven, vertebrae, in, the, sacrum, with, both, dorsosacrals, and, caudosacrals, s, stenops, preserves, 46, caudal, vertebrae, and, up, to, 49, and, along, the, series, both, the, centrums, and, the, neural, spines, become, smaller, until, the, neural, spines, disappear, at, caudal, 35, around, the, middle, of, the, tail, the, neural, spines, become, bifurcated, meaning, they, are, divided, near, the, top, with, multiple, well, preserved, skeletons, s, stenops, preserves, all, regions, of, the, body, including, the, limbs, the, scapula, shoulder, blade, is, sub, rectangular, with, a, robust, blade, though, it, is, not, always, perfectly, preserved, the, acromion, ridge, is, slightly, larger, than, in, kentrosaurus, the, blade, is, relatively, straight, although, it, curves, towards, the, back, there, is, a, small, bump, on, the, back, of, the, blade, that, would, have, served, as, the, base, of, the, triceps, muscle, articulated, with, the, scapula, the, coracoid, is, sub, circular, the, hind, feet, each, had, three, short, toes, while, each, fore, foot, had, five, toes, only, the, inner, two, toes, had, a, blunt, hoof, the, phalangeal, formula, is, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, meaning, the, innermost, finger, of, the, fore, limb, has, two, bones, the, next, has, two, etc, all, four, limbs, were, supported, by, pads, behind, the, toes, the, fore, limbs, were, much, shorter, than, the, stocky, hind, limbs, which, resulted, in, an, unusual, posture, the, tail, appears, to, have, been, held, well, clear, of, the, ground, while, the, head, of, stegosaurus, was, positioned, relatively, low, down, probably, no, higher, than, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, above, the, ground, the, most, recognizable, features, of, stegosaurus, are, its, dermal, plates, which, consisted, of, between, 17, and, 22, separate, plates, and, flat, spines, these, were, highly, modified, osteoderms, bony, cored, scales, similar, to, those, seen, in, crocodiles, and, many, lizards, today, they, were, not, directly, attached, to, the, animal, s, skeleton, instead, arising, from, the, skin, the, largest, plates, were, found, over, the, hips, and, could, measure, over, 60, cm, 24, in, wide, and, 60, cm, 24, in, tall, in, a, 2010, review, of, stegosaurus, species, peter, galton, suggested, that, the, arrangement, of, the, plates, on, the, back, may, have, varied, between, species, and, that, the, pattern, of, plates, as, viewed, in, profile, may, have, been, important, for, species, recognition, galton, noted, that, the, plates, in, s, stenops, have, been, found, articulated, in, two, staggered, rows, rather, than, paired, fewer, s, ungulatus, plates, have, been, found, and, none, articulated, making, the, arrangement, in, this, species, more, difficult, to, determine, however, the, type, specimen, of, s, ungulatus, preserves, two, flattened, spine, like, plates, from, the, tail, that, are, nearly, identical, in, shape, and, size, but, are, mirror, images, of, each, other, suggesting, that, at, least, these, were, arranged, in, pairs, many, of, the, plates, are, manifestly, chiral, and, no, two, plates, of, the, same, size, and, shape, have, been, found, for, an, individual, however, plates, have, been, correlated, between, individuals, well, preserved, integumentary, impressions, of, the, plates, of, hesperosaurus, show, a, smooth, surface, with, long, and, parallel, shallow, grooves, this, indicates, that, the, plates, were, covered, in, keratinous, sheaths, like, the, spikes, and, shields, of, ankylosaurs, the, bony, plates, and, spines, of, stegosaurians, evolved, from, the, low, keeled, osteoderms, characteristic, of, basal, thyreophorans, galton, 2019, interpreted, plates, of, an, armored, dinosaur, from, the, lower, jurassic, sinemurian, pliensbachian, lower, kota, formation, of, india, as, fossils, of, a, member, of, ankylosauria, the, author, argued, that, this, finding, indicates, a, probable, early, early, jurassic, origin, for, both, ankylosauria, and, its, sister, group, stegosauria, the, vast, majority, of, stegosaurian, dinosaurs, thus, far, recovered, belong, to, the, stegosauridae, which, lived, in, the, later, part, of, the, jurassic, and, early, cretaceous, and, which, were, defined, by, paul, sereno, as, all, stegosaurians, more, closely, related, to, stegosaurus, than, to, huayangosaurus, this, group, is, widespread, with, members, across, the, northern, hemisphere, africa, and, possibly, south, america, stegosaurus, frequently, is, discovered, in, a, clade, within, the, stegosauridae, called, stegosaurinae, usually, including, the, taxa, wuerhosaurus, and, hesperosaurus, the, cladogram, below, displays, the, results, of, the, preferred,

from, stratigraphic, zone, 1, susannah, maidment, and, colleagues, in, 2008, proposed, extensive, alterations, to, the, taxonomy, of, stegosaurus, they, advocated, synonymizing, s, stenops, and, s, ungulatus, with, s, armatus, and, sinking, hesperosaurus, and, wuerhosaurus, into, stegosaurus, with, their, type, species, becoming, stegosaurus, mjosi, and, stegosaurus, homheni, respectively, they, regarded, s, longispinus, as, dubious, thus, their, conception, of, stegosaurus, would, include, three, valid, species, s, armatus, s, homheni, and, s, mjosi, and, would, range, from, the, late, jurassic, of, north, america, and, europe, to, the, early, cretaceous, of, asia, however, this, classification, scheme, was, not, followed, by, other, researchers, and, a, 2017, cladistic, analysis, co, authored, by, maidment, with, thomas, raven, rejects, the, synonymy, of, hesperosaurus, with, stegosaurus, in, 2015, maidment, et, al, revised, their, suggestion, due, to, the, recognition, by, galton, of, s, armatus, as, a, nomen, dubium, and, its, replacement, by, s, stenops, as, type, species, in, 2024, li, and, colleagues, described, specimen, gsau, 201201, a, partial, skeleton, of, a, stegosaur, from, the, upper, hekou, group, of, gansu, province, china, discovered, in, c, 2000, 04, which, dates, to, the, aptian, albian, ages, of, the, early, cretaceous, the, specimen, consists, of, three, articulated, cervical, vertebrae, with, associated, ribs, three, dorsal, vertebrae, thirteen, ribs, a, right, forelimb, including, a, partial, humerus, ulna, and, radius, and, one, dermal, plate, although, certain, features, of, the, fossil, material, are, different, when, compared, to, wuerhosaurus, and, stegosaurus, stenops, li, et, al, considered, the, new, specimen, as, stegosaurus, sp, fossils, of, the, ankylosaur, taohelong, were, also, found, in, the, same, layers, of, the, hekou, group, soon, after, its, discovery, marsh, considered, stegosaurus, to, have, been, bipedal, due, to, its, short, forelimbs, he, had, changed, his, mind, however, by, 1891, after, considering, the, heavy, build, of, the, animal, although, stegosaurus, is, undoubtedly, now, considered, to, have, been, quadrupedal, some, discussion, has, occurred, over, whether, it, could, have, reared, up, on, its, hind, legs, using, its, tail, to, form, a, tripod, with, its, hind, limbs, to, browse, for, higher, foliage, this, has, been, proposed, by, bakker, and, opposed, by, carpenter, a, study, by, mallison, 2010, found, support, for, a, rearing, up, posture, in, kentrosaurus, though, not, for, ability, for, the, tail, to, act, as, a, tripod, stegosaurus, had, short, fore, limbs, in, relation, to, its, hind, limbs, furthermore, within, the, hind, limbs, the, lower, section, comprising, the, tibia, and, fibula, was, short, compared, with, the, femur, this, suggests, it, could, not, walk, very, fast, as, the, stride, of, the, back, legs, at, speed, would, have, overtaken, the, front, legs, giving, a, maximum, speed, of, 15, 3, 17, 9, km, h, 9, 5, 11, 1, mph, tracks, discovered, by, matthew, mossbrucker, morrison, natural, history, museum, colorado, suggest, that, stegosaurus, lived, and, traveled, in, multiple, age, herds, one, group, of, tracks, is, interpreted, as, showing, four, or, five, baby, stegosaurs, moving, in, the, same, direction, while, another, has, a, juvenile, stegosaur, track, with, an, adult, track, overprinting, it, as, the, plates, would, have, been, obstacles, during, copulation, it, is, possible, the, female, stegosaur, laid, on, her, side, as, the, male, entered, her, from, above, and, behind, another, suggestion, is, that, the, female, would, stand, on, all, fours, but, squat, down, the, fore, limbs, and, raise, the, tail, up, and, out, of, the, male, s, way, as, he, supports, his, fore, limbs, on, her, hips, however, their, reproductive, organs, still, could, not, touch, as, there, is, no, evidence, of, muscle, attachments, for, a, mobile, penis, nor, a, baculum, in, male, dinosaurs, the, function, of, stegosaurus, plates, has, been, much, debated, marsh, suggested, that, they, functioned, as, some, form, of, armor, though, davitashvili, 1961, disputed, this, claiming, that, they, were, too, fragile, and, ill, placed, for, defensive, purposes, leaving, the, animal, s, sides, unprotected, nevertheless, others, have, continued, to, support, a, defensive, function, bakker, suggested, in, 1986, that, the, plates, were, covered, in, horn, comparing, the, surface, of, the, fossilized, plates, to, the, bony, cores, of, horns, in, other, animals, known, or, thought, to, bear, horns, christiansen, and, tschopp, 2010, having, studied, a, well, preserved, specimen, of, hesperosaurus, with, skin, impressions, concluded, that, the, plates, were, covered, in, a, keratin, sheath, which, would, have, strengthened, the, plate, as, a, whole, and, provided, it, with, sharp, cutting, edges, bakker, stated, that, stegosaurus, could, flip, its, osteoderms, from, one, side, to, another, to, present, a, predator, with, an, array, of, spikes, and, blades, that, would, impede, it, from, closing, sufficiently, to, attack, the, stegosaurus, effectively, he, contends, that, they, had, insufficient, width, for, them, to, stand, erect, easily, in, such, a, manner, as, to, be, useful, in, display, without, continuous, muscular, effort, mobility, of, the, plates, however, has, been, disputed, by, other, paleontologists, another, possible, function, of, the, plates, is, they, may, have, helped, to, control, the, body, temperature, of, the, animal, in, a, similar, way, to, the, sails, of, the, pelycosaurs, dimetrodon, and, edaphosaurus, and, modern, elephant, and, rabbit, ears, the, plates, had, blood, vessels, running, through, grooves, and, air, flowing, around, the, plates, would, have, cooled, the, blood, buffr, nil, et, al, 1986, found, extreme, vascularization, of, the, outer, layer, of, bone, which, was, seen, as, evidence, that, the, plates, acted, as, thermoregulatory, devices, likewise, 2010, structural, comparisons, of, stegosaurus, plates, to, alligator, osteoderms, seem, to, support, the, conclusion, that, the, potential, for, a, thermoregulatory, role, in, the, plates, of, stegosaurus, definitely, exists, the, thermoregulation, hypothesis, has, been, seriously, questioned, since, other, stegosaurs, such, as, kentrosaurus, had, more, low, surface, area, spikes, than, plates, implying, that, cooling, was, not, important, enough, to, require, specialized, structural, formations, such, as, plates, however, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, plates, could, have, helped, the, animal, increase, heat, absorption, from, the, sun, since, a, cooling, trend, occurred, towards, the, end, of, the, jurassic, a, large, ectothermic, reptile, might, have, used, the, increased, surface, area, afforded, by, the, plates, to, absorb, radiation, from, the, sun, christiansen, and, tschopp, 2010, state, that, the, presence, of, a, smooth, insulating, keratin, covering, would, have, hampered, thermoregulation, but, such, a, function, cannot, be, entirely, ruled, out, as, extant, cattle, and, ducks, use, horns, and, beaks, to, dump, excess, heat, despite, the, keratin, covering, histological, surveys, of, plate, microstructure, attributed, the, vascularization, to, the, need, to, transport, nutrients, for, rapid, plate, growth, the, vascular, system, of, the, plates, have, been, theorized, to, have, played, a, role, in, threat, displaying, as, stegosaurus, could, have, pumped, blood, into, them, causing, them, to, blush, and, give, a, colorful, red, warning, however, the, stegosaur, plates, were, covered, in, horn, rather, than, skin, the, plates, large, size, suggests, that, they, may, have, served, to, increase, the, apparent, height, of, the, animal, either, to, intimidate, enemies, or, to, impress, other, members, of, the, same, species, in, some, form, of, sexual, display, a, 2015, study, of, the, shapes, and, sizes, of, hesperosaurus, plates, suggested, that, they, were, sexually, dimorphic, with, wide, plates, belonging, to, males, and, taller, plates, belonging, to, females, christiansen, and, tschopp, 2010, proposed, that, the, display, function, would, have, been, reinforced, by, the, horny, sheath, which, would, have, increased, the, visible, surface, and, such, horn, structures, are, often, brightly, colored, some, have, suggested, that, plates, in, stegosaurs, were, used, to, allow, individuals, to, identify, members, of, their, species, the, use, of, exaggerated, structures, in, dinosaurs, as, species, identification, has, been, questioned, as, no, such, function, exists, in, modern, species, there, has, been, debate, about, whether, the, tail, spikes, were, only, used, for, display, as, posited, by, gilmore, in, 1914, or, used, as, a, weapon, robert, bakker, noted, the, tail, was, likely, to, have, been, much, more, flexible, than, that, of, other, dinosaurs, as, it, lacked, ossified, tendons, thus, lending, credence, to, the, idea, of, the, tail, as, a, weapon, however, as, carpenter, has, noted, the, plates, overlap, so, many, tail, vertebrae, movement, would, be, limited, bakker, also, observed, that, stegosaurus, could, have, maneuvered, its, rear, easily, by, keeping, its, large, hind, limbs, stationary, and, pushing, off, with, its, very, powerfully, muscled, but, short, forelimbs, allowing, it, to, swivel, deftly, to, deal, with, attack, more, recently, a, study, of, the, tail, spikes, by, mcwhinney, et, al, which, showed, a, high, incidence, of, trauma, related, damage, lends, more, weight, to, the, position, that, the, spikes, were, indeed, used, in, combat, this, study, showed, that, 9, 8, of, stegosaurus, specimens, examined, had, injuries, to, their, tail, spikes, additional, support, for, this, idea, was, a, punctured, tail, vertebra, of, an, allosaurus, into, which, a, tail, spike, fits, perfectly, the, damage, shows, that, the, spike, entered, at, an, angle, from, below, and, displaced, a, piece, of, the, process, upward, remodeled, bone, on, the, underside, of, the, process, shows, that, an, infection, developed, s, stenops, had, four, dermal, spikes, each, about, 60, 90, cm, 2, 0, 3, 0, ft, long, discoveries, of, articulated, stegosaur, armor, show, at, least, in, some, species, these, spikes, protruded, horizontally, from, the, tail, not, vertically, as, is, often, depicted, initially, marsh, described, s, ungulatus, as, having, eight, spikes, in, its, tail, unlike, s, stenops, however, recent, research, re, examined, this, and, concluded, this, species, also, had, four, juveniles, of, stegosaurus, have, been, preserved, probably, showing, the, growth, of, the, genus, the, two, juveniles, are, both, relatively, small, with, the, smaller, individual, being, 1, 5, m, 4, 9, ft, long, and, the, larger, having, a, length, of, 2, 6, m, 8, 5, ft, the, specimens, can, be, identified, as, not, mature, because, they, lack, the, fusion, of, the, scapula, and, coracoid, and, the, lower, hind, limbs, also, the, pelvic, region, of, the, specimens, are, similar, to, kentrosaurus, juveniles, one, 2009, study, of, stegosaurus, specimens, of, various, sizes, found, that, the, plates, and, spikes, had, slower, histological, growth, than, the, skeleton, at, least, until, the, dinosaur, reached, its, mature, size, a, 2013, study, concluded, based, on, the, rapid, deposition, of, highly, vascularised, fibrolamellar, bone, that, kentrosaurus, had, a, quicker, growth, rate, than, stegosaurus, contradicting, the, general, rule, that, larger, dinosaurs, grew, faster, than, smaller, ones, a, 2022, study, by, wiemann, and, colleagues, of, various, dinosaur, genera, including, stegosaurus, suggests, that, it, had, an, ectothermic, cold, blooded, or, gigantothermic, metabolism, on, par, with, that, of, modern, reptiles, this, was, uncovered, using, the, spectroscopy, of, lipoxidation, signals, which, are, byproducts, of, oxidative, phosphorylation, and, correlate, with, metabolic, rates, they, suggested, that, such, metabolisms, may, have, been, common, for, ornithischian, dinosaurs, in, general, with, the, group, evolving, towards, ectothermy, from, an, ancestor, with, an, endothermic, warm, blooded, metabolism, stegosaurus, and, related, genera, were, herbivores, however, their, teeth, and, jaws, are, very, different, from, those, of, other, herbivorous, ornithischian, dinosaurs, suggesting, a, different, feeding, strategy, that, is, not, yet, well, understood, the, other, ornithischians, possessed, teeth, capable, of, grinding, plant, material, and, a, jaw, structure, capable, of, movements, in, planes, other, than, simply, orthal, i, e, not, only, the, fused, up, down, motion, to, which, stegosaur, jaws, were, likely, limited, unlike, the, sturdy, jaws, and, grinding, teeth, common, to, its, fellow, ornithischians, stegosaurus, and, all, stegosaurians, had, small, peg, shaped, teeth, that, have, been, observed, with, horizontal, wear, facets, associated, with, tooth, food, contact, and, their, unusual, jaws, were, probably, capable, of, only, orthal, up, down, movements, their, teeth, were, not, tightly, pressed, together, in, a, block, for, efficient, grinding, and, no, evidence, in, the, fossil, record, of, stegosaurians, indicates, use, of, gastroliths, the, stone, s, some, dinosaurs, and, some, present, day, bird, species, ingested, to, aid, the, grinding, process, so, how, exactly, stegosaurus, obtained, and, processed, the, amount, of, plant, material, required, to, sustain, its, size, remains, poorly, understood, the, stegosaurians, were, widely, distributed, geographically, in, the, late, jurassic, palaeontologists, believe, it, would, have, eaten, plants, such, as, mosses, ferns, horsetails, cycads, and, conifers, one, hypothesized, feeding, behavior, strategy, considers, them, to, be, low, level, browsers, eating, low, growing, foliage, of, various, nonflowering, plants, this, scenario, has, stegosaurus, foraging, at, most, 1, m, above, the, ground, conversely, if, stegosaurus, could, have, raised, itself, on, two, legs, as, suggested, by, bakker, then, it, could, have, browsed, on, vegetation, quite, high, up, with, adults, being, able, to, forage, up, to, 6, m, 20, ft, above, the, ground, a, detailed, computer, analysis, of, the, biomechanics, of, stegosaurus, s, feeding, behavior, was, performed, in, 2010, using, two, different, three, dimensional, models, of, stegosaurus, teeth, given, realistic, physics, and, properties, bite, force, was, also, calculated, using, these, models, and, the, known, skull, proportions, of, the, animal, as, well, as, simulated, tree, branches, of, different, size, and, hardness, the, resultant, bite, forces, calculated, for, stegosaurus, were, 140, 1, newtons, n, 183, 7, n, and, 275, n, for, anterior, middle, and, posterior, teeth, respectively, which, means, its, bite, force, was, less, than, half, that, of, a, labrador, retriever, stegosaurus, could, have, easily, bitten, through, smaller, green, branches, but, would, have, had, difficulty, with, anything, over, 12, mm, in, diameter, stegosaurus, therefore, probably, browsed, primarily, among, smaller, twigs, and, foliage, and, would, have, been, unable, to, handle, larger, plant, parts, unless, the, animal, was, capable, of, biting, much, more, efficiently, than, predicted, in, this, study, however, a, 2016, study, indicates, that, stegosaurus, s, bite, strength, was, stronger, than, previously, believed, comparisons, were, made, between, it, represented, by, a, specimen, known, as, sophie, from, the, united, kingdom, s, natural, history, museum, and, two, other, herbivorous, dinosaurs, erlikosaurus, and, plateosaurus, to, determine, if, all, three, had, similar, bite, forces, and, similar, niches, based, on, the, results, of, the, study, it, was, revealed, that, the, subadult, stegosaurus, specimen, had, a, bite, similar, in, strength, to, that, of, modern, herbivorous, mammals, in, particular, cattle, and, sheep, based, on, this, data, it, is, likely, stegosaurus, also, ate, woodier, tougher, plants, such, as, cycads, perhaps, even, acting, as, a, means, of, spreading, cycad, seeds, at, one, time, stegosaurs, were, described, as, having, a, second, brain, in, their, hips, soon, after, describing, stegosaurus, marsh, noted, a, large, canal, in, the, hip, region, of, the, spinal, cord, which, could, have, accommodated, a, structure, up, to, 20, times, larger, than, the, famously, small, brain, this, has, led, to, the, influential, idea, that, dinosaurs, like, stegosaurus, had, a, second, brain, in, the, tail, which, may, have, been, responsible, for, controlling, reflexes, in, the, rear, portion, of, the, body, this, brain, was, proposed, to, have, given, a, stegosaurus, a, temporary, boost, when, it, was, under, threat, from, predators, this, space, however, is, more, likely, to, have, served, other, purposes, the, sacro, lumbar, expansion, is, not, unique, to, stegosaurs, nor, even, ornithischians, it, is, also, present, in, birds, in, their, case, it, contains, what, is, called, the, glycogen, body, a, structure, whose, function, is, not, definitely, known, but, which, is, postulated, to, facilitate, the, supply, of, glycogen, to, the, animal, s, nervous, system, it, also, may, function, as, a, balance, organ, or, reservoir, of, compounds, to, support, the, nervous, system, the, morrison, formation, is, interpreted, as, a, semiarid, environment, with, distinct, wet, and, dry, seasons, and, flat, floodplains, vegetation, varied, from, river, lining, forests, of, conifers, tree, ferns, and, ferns, gallery, forests, to, fern, savannas, with, occasional, trees, such, as, the, araucaria, like, conifer, brachyphyllum, the, flora, of, the, period, has, been, revealed, by, fossils, of, green, algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, ferns, cycads, ginkoes, and, several, families, of, conifers, animal, fossils, discovered, include, bivalves, snails, ray, finned, fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, like, glyptops, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial, and, aquatic, crocodylomorphs, like, hoplosuchus, several, species, of, pterosaurs, such, as, harpactognathus, and, mesadactylus, numerous, dinosaur, species, and, early, mammals, such, as, docodonts, like, docodon, multituberculates, symmetrodonts, and, triconodonts, dinosaurs, that, lived, alongside, stegosaurus, included, theropods, allosaurus, saurophaganax, torvosaurus, ceratosaurus, marshosaurus, stokesosaurus, ornitholestes, coelurus, and, tanycolagreus, sauropods, dominated, the, region, and, included, brontosaurus, brachiosaurus, apatosaurus, diplodocus, camarasaurus, and, barosaurus, other, ornithischians, included, camptosaurus, gargoyleosaurus, dryosaurus, and, nanosaurus, stegosaurus, is, commonly, found, at, the, same, sites, as, allosaurus, apatosaurus, camarasaurus, and, diplodocus, stegosaurus, may, have, preferred, drier, settings, than, these, other, dinosaurs, one, of, the, most, recognizable, of, all, dinosaurs, stegosaurus, has, been, depicted, on, film, in, cartoons, and, comics, and, as, children, s, toys, due, to, the, fragmentary,
