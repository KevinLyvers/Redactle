also, see, text, the, cougar, puma, concolor, k, u, r, koo, g, r, also, known, as, the, panther, mountain, lion, catamount, and, puma, is, a, large, cat, native, to, the, americas, it, inhabits, north, central, and, south, america, making, it, the, most, widely, distributed, wild, terrestrial, mammal, in, the, western, hemisphere, and, one, of, the, most, widespread, in, the, world, its, range, spans, the, yukon, british, columbia, and, alberta, provinces, of, canada, the, rocky, mountains, and, areas, in, the, western, united, states, further, south, its, range, extends, through, mexico, to, the, amazon, rainforest, and, the, southern, andes, mountains, in, patagonia, it, is, an, adaptable, generalist, species, occurring, in, most, american, habitat, types, it, prefers, habitats, with, dense, underbrush, and, rocky, areas, for, stalking, but, also, lives, in, open, areas, the, cougar, is, largely, solitary, its, activity, pattern, varies, from, diurnality, and, cathemerality, to, crepuscularity, and, nocturnality, between, protected, and, non, protected, areas, and, is, apparently, correlated, with, the, presence, of, other, predators, prey, species, livestock, and, humans, it, is, an, ambush, predator, that, pursues, a, wide, variety, of, prey, ungulates, particularly, deer, are, its, primary, prey, but, it, also, hunts, rodents, it, is, territorial, and, lives, at, low, population, densities, individual, home, ranges, depend, on, terrain, vegetation, and, abundance, of, prey, while, large, it, is, not, always, the, dominant, apex, predator, in, its, range, yielding, prey, to, other, predators, it, is, reclusive, and, mostly, avoids, people, fatal, attacks, on, humans, are, rare, but, increased, in, north, america, as, more, people, entered, cougar, habitat, and, built, farms, the, cougar, is, listed, as, least, concern, on, the, iucn, red, list, intensive, hunting, following, european, colonization, of, the, americas, and, ongoing, human, development, into, cougar, habitat, has, caused, populations, to, decline, in, most, parts, of, its, historical, range, in, particular, the, eastern, cougar, population, is, considered, to, be, mostly, locally, extinct, in, eastern, north, america, since, the, early, 20th, century, with, the, exception, of, the, isolated, florida, panther, subpopulation, the, word, cougar, is, borrowed, from, the, portuguese, u, uarana, via, french, it, was, originally, derived, from, the, tupi, language, a, current, form, in, brazil, is, su, uarana, in, the, 17th, century, georg, marcgrave, named, it, cuguacu, ara, marcgrave, s, rendering, was, reproduced, in, 1648, by, his, associate, willem, piso, cuguacu, ara, was, then, adopted, by, john, ray, in, 1693, in, 1774, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, converted, cuguacu, ara, to, cuguar, which, was, later, modified, to, cougar, in, english, the, cougar, holds, the, guinness, record, for, the, animal, with, the, greatest, number, of, names, with, over, 40, in, english, alone, puma, is, the, common, name, used, in, latin, america, and, most, parts, of, europe, the, term, puma, is, also, sometimes, used, in, the, united, states, the, first, use, of, puma, in, english, dates, to, 1777, introduced, from, spanish, from, the, quechua, language, in, the, western, united, states, and, canada, it, is, also, called, mountain, lion, a, name, first, used, in, writing, in, 1858, other, names, include, panther, although, it, does, not, belong, to, the, genus, panthera, and, catamount, meaning, cat, of, the, mountains, felis, concolor, was, the, scientific, name, proposed, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1771, for, a, cat, with, a, long, tail, from, brazil, the, specific, epithet, of, the, name, concolor, is, latin, for, of, uniform, color, it, was, placed, in, the, genus, puma, by, william, jardine, in, 1834, this, genus, is, part, of, the, felinae, the, cougar, is, most, closely, related, to, the, jaguarundi, and, the, cheetah, following, linnaeus, s, first, scientific, description, of, the, cougar, 32, cougar, zoological, specimens, were, described, and, proposed, as, subspecies, until, the, late, 1980s, genetic, analysis, of, cougar, mitochondrial, dna, indicates, that, many, of, these, are, too, similar, to, be, recognized, as, distinct, at, a, molecular, level, but, that, only, six, phylogeographic, groups, exist, the, florida, panther, samples, showed, a, low, microsatellite, variation, possibly, due, to, inbreeding, following, this, research, the, authors, of, mammal, species, of, the, world, recognized, the, following, six, subspecies, in, 2005, in, 2006, the, florida, panther, was, still, referred, to, as, a, distinct, subspecies, p, c, coryi, in, research, works, as, of, 2017, the, cat, classification, taskforce, of, the, cat, specialist, group, recognizes, only, two, subspecies, as, valid, lynx, cheetah, a, jubatus, cougar, jaguarundi, h, yagouaroundi, felis, otocolobus, prionailurus, the, family, felidae, is, believed, to, have, originated, in, asia, about, 11, million, years, ago, mya, taxonomic, research, on, felids, remains, partial, and, much, of, what, is, known, about, their, evolutionary, history, is, based, on, mitochondrial, dna, analysis, significant, confidence, intervals, exist, with, suggested, dates, in, the, latest, genomic, study, of, the, felidae, the, common, ancestor, of, today, s, leopardus, lynx, puma, prionailurus, and, felis, lineages, migrated, across, the, bering, land, bridge, into, the, americas, 8, 0, to, 8, 5, million, years, ago, the, lineages, subsequently, diverged, in, that, order, north, american, felids, then, invaded, south, america, 2, 4, mya, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, following, the, formation, of, the, isthmus, of, panama, the, cheetah, lineage, is, suggested, by, some, studies, to, have, diverged, from, the, puma, lineage, in, the, americas, and, migrated, back, to, asia, and, africa, while, other, research, suggests, the, cheetah, diverged, in, the, old, world, itself, a, high, level, of, genetic, similarity, has, been, found, among, north, american, cougar, populations, suggesting, they, are, all, fairly, recent, descendants, of, a, small, ancestral, group, culver, et, al, propose, the, original, north, american, cougar, population, was, extirpated, during, the, pleistocene, extinctions, some, 10, 000, years, ago, when, other, large, mammals, such, as, smilodon, also, disappeared, north, america, was, then, repopulated, by, south, american, cougars, a, coprolite, identified, as, from, a, cougar, was, excavated, in, argentina, s, catamarca, province, and, dated, to, 17, 002, 16, 573, years, old, it, contained, toxascaris, leonina, eggs, this, finding, indicates, that, the, cougar, and, the, parasite, existed, in, south, america, since, at, least, the, late, pleistocene, the, oldest, fossil, record, of, a, cougar, puma, concolor, in, south, america, argentina, is, a, partial, skull, from, the, late, calabrian, ensenadan, age, the, head, of, the, cougar, is, round, and, the, ears, are, erect, its, powerful, forequarters, neck, and, jaw, serve, to, grasp, and, hold, large, prey, it, has, four, retractile, claws, on, its, hind, paws, and, five, on, its, forepaws, of, which, one, is, a, dewclaw, the, larger, front, feet, and, claws, are, adaptations, for, clutching, prey, cougars, are, slender, and, agile, members, of, the, felidae, they, are, the, fourth, largest, cat, species, worldwide, adults, stand, about, 60, to, 90, cm, 24, to, 35, in, tall, at, the, shoulders, adult, males, are, around, 2, 4, m, 7, ft, 10, in, long, from, nose, to, tail, tip, and, females, average, 2, 05, m, 6, ft, 9, in, with, overall, ranges, between, 1, 50, to, 2, 75, m, 4, ft, 11, in, to, 9, ft, 0, in, nose, to, tail, suggested, for, the, species, in, general, of, this, length, the, tail, typically, accounts, for, 63, to, 95, cm, 25, to, 37, in, males, generally, weigh, 53, to, 72, kg, 117, to, 159, lb, females, typically, weigh, between, 34, and, 48, kg, 75, and, 106, lb, cougar, size, is, smallest, close, to, the, equator, and, larger, towards, the, poles, the, largest, recorded, cougar, shot, in, 1901, weighed, 105, 2, kg, 232, lb, claims, of, 125, 2, kg, 276, lb, and, 118, kg, 260, lb, have, been, reported, though, they, were, probably, exaggerated, male, cougars, in, north, america, average, 62, kg, 137, lb, while, the, average, female, in, the, same, region, averages, about, 42, kg, 93, lb, on, average, adult, male, cougars, in, british, columbia, weigh, 56, 7, kg, 125, lb, and, adult, females, 45, 4, kg, 100, lb, though, several, male, cougars, in, british, columbia, weighed, between, 86, 4, and, 95, 5, kg, 190, and, 211, lb, depending, on, the, locality, cougars, can, be, smaller, or, bigger, than, jaguars, but, are, less, muscular, and, not, as, powerfully, built, so, on, average, their, weight, is, less, whereas, the, size, of, cougars, tends, to, increase, as, much, as, distance, from, the, equator, increases, which, crosses, the, northern, portion, of, south, america, jaguars, are, generally, smaller, north, of, the, amazon, river, in, south, america, and, larger, south, of, it, for, example, while, south, american, jaguars, are, comparatively, large, and, may, exceed, 90, kg, 200, lb, north, american, jaguars, in, mexico, s, chamela, cuixmala, biosphere, reserve, weigh, approximately, 50, kg, 110, lb, about, the, same, as, female, cougars, cougar, coloring, is, plain, hence, the, latin, concolor, in, the, scientific, name, but, can, vary, greatly, across, individuals, and, even, siblings, the, coat, is, typically, tawny, but, it, ranges, from, silvery, grey, to, reddish, with, lighter, patches, on, the, underbody, including, the, jaws, chin, and, throat, infants, are, spotted, and, born, with, blue, eyes, and, rings, on, their, tails, juveniles, are, pale, and, dark, spots, remain, on, their, flanks, a, leucistic, individual, was, seen, in, serra, dos, rg, os, national, park, in, rio, de, janeiro, in, 2013, when, it, was, recorded, by, a, camera, trap, indicating, that, pure, white, individuals, do, exist, within, the, species, though, they, are, extremely, rare, the, cougar, has, large, paws, and, proportionally, the, largest, hind, legs, in, the, felidae, allowing, for, great, leaping, and, powerful, short, sprints, it, can, leap, from, the, ground, up, to, 5, 5, m, 18, ft, high, into, a, tree, the, cougar, has, the, most, extensive, range, of, any, wild, land, animal, in, the, americas, spanning, 110, degrees, of, latitude, from, the, yukon, in, canada, to, the, southern, andes, in, chile, the, species, was, extirpated, from, eastern, north, america, aside, from, florida, but, they, may, be, recolonizing, their, former, range, and, isolated, populations, have, been, documented, east, of, their, contemporary, ranges, in, both, the, midwestern, us, and, canada, the, cougar, lives, in, all, forest, types, lowland, and, mountainous, deserts, and, in, open, areas, with, little, vegetation, up, to, an, elevation, of, 5, 800, m, 19, 000, ft, in, the, santa, ana, mountains, it, prefers, steep, canyons, escarpments, rim, rocks, and, dense, brush, in, mexico, it, was, recorded, in, the, sierra, de, san, carlos, in, the, yucat, n, peninsula, it, inhabits, secondary, and, semi, deciduous, forests, in, el, eden, ecological, reserve, in, el, salvador, it, was, recorded, in, the, lower, montane, forest, in, montecristo, national, park, and, in, a, river, basin, in, the, moraz, n, department, above, 700, m, 2, 300, ft, in, 2019, in, colombia, it, was, recorded, in, a, palm, oil, plantation, close, to, a, riparian, forest, in, the, llanos, basin, and, close, to, water, bodies, in, the, magdalena, river, valley, in, the, human, modified, landscape, of, central, argentina, it, inhabits, bushland, with, abundant, vegetation, cover, and, prey, species, cougars, are, an, important, keystone, species, in, western, hemisphere, ecosystems, linking, numerous, species, at, many, trophic, levels, in, a, comprehensive, literature, review, of, more, than, 160, studies, on, cougar, ecology, ecological, interactions, with, 485, other, species, in, cougar, inhabited, ecosystems, have, been, shown, to, involve, different, areas, of, interaction, ranging, from, the, use, of, other, species, as, food, sources, and, prey, fear, effects, on, potential, prey, effects, from, carcass, remains, left, behind, to, competitive, effects, on, other, predator, species, in, shared, habitat, the, most, common, research, topic, in, the, literature, used, here, was, the, cougar, s, diet, and, its, prey, s, regulation, the, cougar, is, a, generalist, hypercarnivore, it, prefers, large, mammals, such, as, mule, deer, white, tailed, deer, elk, moose, mountain, goat, and, bighorn, sheep, it, opportunistically, takes, smaller, prey, such, as, rodents, lagomorphs, smaller, carnivores, birds, and, even, domestic, animals, including, pets, the, mean, weight, of, cougar, vertebrate, prey, increases, with, its, body, weight, and, is, lower, in, areas, closer, to, the, equator, a, survey, of, north, america, research, found, 68, of, prey, items, were, ungulates, especially, deer, only, the, florida, panther, showed, variation, often, preferring, feral, hogs, and, armadillos, cougars, have, been, known, to, prey, on, introduced, gemsbok, populations, in, new, mexico, one, individual, cougar, was, recorded, as, hunting, 29, gemsbok, which, made, up, 58, of, its, recorded, kills, most, gemsbok, kills, were, neonates, but, some, adults, were, also, known, to, have, been, taken, elsewhere, in, the, southwestern, united, states, they, have, been, recorded, to, also, prey, on, feral, horses, in, the, great, basin, as, well, as, feral, donkeys, in, the, sonoran, and, mojave, deserts, investigations, at, yellowstone, national, park, showed, that, elk, and, mule, deer, were, the, cougar, s, primary, prey, the, prey, base, is, shared, with, the, park, s, wolves, with, which, the, cougar, competes, for, resources, a, study, on, winter, kills, from, november, to, april, in, alberta, showed, that, ungulates, accounted, for, greater, than, 99, of, the, cougar, diet, learned, individual, prey, recognition, was, observed, as, some, cougars, rarely, killed, bighorn, sheep, while, others, relied, heavily, on, the, species, in, the, central, and, south, american, cougar, range, area, the, ratio, of, deer, in, the, diet, declines, small, to, mid, sized, mammals, including, large, rodents, such, as, the, capybara, are, preferred, ungulates, accounted, for, only, 35, of, prey, items, in, one, survey, about, half, that, of, north, america, competition, with, the, larger, jaguar, in, south, america, has, been, suggested, for, the, decline, in, the, size, of, prey, items, in, central, or, north, america, the, cougar, and, jaguar, share, the, same, prey, depending, on, its, abundance, other, listed, prey, species, of, the, cougar, include, mice, porcupines, american, beavers, raccoons, hares, guanacoes, peccaries, vicu, as, rheas, and, wild, turkeys, birds, and, small, reptiles, are, sometimes, preyed, upon, in, the, south, but, this, is, rarely, recorded, in, north, america, magellanic, penguins, spheniscus, magellanicus, constitute, the, majority, of, prey, items, in, cougar, diet, in, patagonia, s, bosques, petrificados, de, jaramillo, national, park, and, monte, le, n, national, park, although, capable, of, sprinting, the, cougar, is, typically, an, ambush, predator, it, stalks, through, brush, and, trees, across, ledges, or, other, covered, spots, before, delivering, a, powerful, leap, onto, the, back, of, its, prey, and, a, suffocating, neck, bite, the, cougar, can, break, the, neck, of, some, of, its, smaller, prey, with, a, strong, bite, and, momentum, bearing, the, animal, to, the, ground, kills, are, generally, estimated, around, one, large, ungulate, every, two, weeks, the, period, shrinks, for, females, raising, young, and, may, be, as, short, as, one, kill, every, three, days, when, cubs, are, nearly, mature, around, 15, months, the, cat, drags, a, kill, to, a, preferred, spot, covers, it, with, brush, and, returns, to, feed, over, a, period, of, days, the, cougar, is, generally, reported, to, not, be, a, scavenger, but, deer, carcasses, left, exposed, for, study, were, scavenged, by, cougars, in, california, suggesting, more, opportunistic, behavior, aside, from, humans, no, species, preys, upon, mature, cougars, in, the, wild, although, conflicts, with, other, predators, or, scavengers, occur, of, the, large, predators, in, yellowstone, national, park, the, grizzly, and, black, bears, gray, wolf, and, cougar, the, massive, grizzly, bear, appears, dominant, often, though, not, always, able, to, drive, a, gray, wolf, pack, black, bear, or, cougar, off, their, kills, one, study, found, that, grizzlies, and, american, black, bears, visited, 24, of, cougar, kills, in, yellowstone, and, glacier, national, parks, usurping, 10, of, carcasses, bears, gained, up, to, 113, and, cougars, lost, up, to, 26, of, their, daily, energy, requirements, from, these, encounters, in, colorado, and, california, black, bears, were, found, to, visit, 48, and, 77, of, kills, respectively, in, general, cougars, are, subordinate, to, black, bears, when, it, comes, to, killing, and, when, bears, are, most, active, the, cats, take, prey, more, frequently, and, spend, less, time, feeding, on, each, kill, unlike, several, subordinate, predators, from, other, ecosystems, cougars, do, not, appear, to, exploit, spatial, or, temporal, refuges, to, avoid, competitors, the, gray, wolf, and, the, cougar, compete, more, directly, for, prey, mostly, in, winter, packs, of, wolves, can, steal, cougars, kills, and, there, are, some, documented, cases, of, cougars, being, killed, by, them, one, report, describes, a, large, pack, of, seven, to, 11, wolves, killing, a, female, cougar, and, her, kittens, while, in, nearby, sun, valley, idaho, a, 2, year, old, male, cougar, was, found, dead, apparently, killed, by, a, wolf, pack, conversely, one, to, one, confrontations, tend, to, be, dominated, by, the, cat, and, there, are, various, documented, accounts, where, wolves, have, been, ambushed, and, killed, including, adult, male, specimens, wolves, more, broadly, affect, cougar, population, dynamics, and, distribution, by, dominating, territory, and, prey, opportunities, and, disrupting, the, feline, s, behavior, preliminary, research, in, yellowstone, for, instance, has, shown, displacement, of, the, cougar, by, wolves, one, researcher, in, oregon, noted, when, there, is, a, pack, around, cougars, are, not, comfortable, around, their, kills, or, raising, kittens, a, lot, of, times, a, big, cougar, will, kill, a, wolf, but, the, pack, phenomenon, changes, the, table, both, species, are, capable, of, killing, mid, sized, predators, such, as, bobcats, canada, lynxes, wolverines, and, coyotes, and, tend, to, suppress, their, numbers, although, cougars, can, kill, coyotes, the, latter, have, been, documented, attempting, to, prey, on, cougar, cubs, the, cougar, and, jaguar, share, overlapping, territory, in, the, southern, portion, of, its, range, the, jaguar, tends, to, take, the, larger, prey, where, ranges, overlap, reducing, both, the, cougar, s, potential, size, and, the, likelihood, of, direct, competition, between, the, two, cats, cougars, appear, better, than, jaguars, at, exploiting, a, broader, prey, niche, and, smaller, prey, the, cougar, is, a, mostly, solitary, animal, only, mothers, and, kittens, live, in, groups, with, adults, meeting, rarely, while, generally, loners, cougars, will, reciprocally, share, kills, and, seem, to, organize, themselves, into, small, communities, defined, by, the, territories, of, dominant, males, cats, within, these, areas, socialize, more, frequently, with, each, other, than, with, outsiders, in, the, vicinity, of, a, cattle, ranch, in, northern, mexico, cougars, exhibited, nocturnal, activity, that, overlapped, foremost, with, the, activity, of, calves, in, a, nature, reserve, in, central, mexico, the, activity, of, cougars, was, crepuscular, and, nocturnal, overlapping, largely, with, the, activity, of, the, nine, banded, armadillo, dasypus, novemcinctus, cougars, in, the, montane, abra, tanchipa, biosphere, reserve, in, southeastern, mexico, displayed, a, cathemeral, activity, pattern, data, from, 12, years, of, camera, trapping, in, the, pacific, slope, and, talamanca, cordillera, of, costa, rica, showed, cougars, as, cathemeral, both, cougars, and, jaguars, in, the, cockscomb, basin, of, belize, were, nocturnal, but, avoided, each, other, in, a, protected, cloud, forest, in, the, central, andes, of, colombia, cougars, were, active, from, late, afternoon, to, shortly, before, sunrise, and, sometimes, during, noon, and, early, afternoon, in, protected, areas, of, the, madidi, tambopata, landscape, in, bolivia, and, peru, cougars, were, active, throughout, the, day, but, with, a, tendency, to, nocturnal, activity, that, overlapped, with, the, activity, of, main, prey, species, during, an, 8, year, long, study, in, a, modified, landscape, in, southeastern, brazil, male, cougars, were, primarily, nocturnal, but, females, were, active, at, night, and, day, cougars, were, diurnal, in, the,

protecting, sufficient, range, areas, are, critical, for, the, sustainability, of, cougar, populations, research, simulations, showed, that, it, faces, a, low, extinction, risk, in, areas, larger, than, 2, 200, km, 2, 850, sq, mi, between, one, and, four, new, individuals, entering, a, population, per, decade, markedly, increases, persistence, thus, highlighting, the, importance, of, habitat,

accidents, involving, cougars, highways, are, a, major, barrier, to, the, dispersal, of, cougars, the, cougar, populations, in, california, are, becoming, fragmented, with, the, increase, in, human, population, and, infrastructure, growth, in, the, state, human, wildlife, conflict, in, proximity, of, 5, km, 2, 1, 9, sq, mi, of, cougar, habitat, is, pronounced, in, areas, with, a, median, human,

areas, more, than, 16, 1, km, 10, 0, mi, away, from, roads, and, 27, 8, km, 17, 3, mi, away, from, settlements, due, to, the, expanding, human, population, cougar, ranges, increasingly, overlap, with, areas, inhabited, by, humans, attacks, on, humans, are, very, rare, as, cougar, prey, recognition, is, a, learned, behavior, and, they, do, not, generally, recognize, humans, as, prey, in, a, 10, year, study, in, new, mexico, of, wild, cougars, who, were, not, habituated, to, humans, the, animals, did, not, exhibit, threatening, behavior, to, researchers, who, approached, closely, median, distance, 18, 5, m, 61, feet, except, in, 6, of, cases, 14, 16, of, those, were, females, with, cubs, attacks, on, people, livestock, and, pets, may, occur, when, a, puma, habituates, to, humans, or, is, in, a, condition, of, severe, starvation, attacks, are, most, frequent, during, late, spring, and, summer, when, juvenile, cougars, leave, their, mothers, and, search, for, new, territory, between, 1890, and, 1990, in, north, america, there, were, 53, reported, confirmed, attacks, on, humans, resulting, in, 48, nonfatal, injuries, and, 10, deaths, of, humans, the, total, is, greater, than, 53, because, some, attacks, had, more, than, one, victim, by, 2004, the, count, had, climbed, to, 88, attacks, and, 20, deaths, within, north, america, the, distribution, of, attacks, is, not, uniform, the, heavily, populated, state, of, california, saw, a, dozen, attacks, from, 1986, to, 2004, after, just, three, from, 1890, to, 1985, including, three, fatalities, in, march, 2024, two, brothers, in, california, were, attacked, by, a, male, cougar, with, one, being, fatally, wounded, it, was, the, state, s, first, fatal, attack, in, 20, years, washington, state, was, the, site, of, a, fatal, attack, in, 2018, its, first, since, 1924, lightly, populated, new, mexico, reported, an, attack, in, 2008, the, first, there, since, 1974, as, with, many, predators, a, cougar, may, attack, if, cornered, if, a, fleeing, human, stimulates, their, instinct, to, chase, or, if, a, person, plays, dead, standing, still, may, cause, the, cougar, to, consider, a, person, easy, prey, exaggerating, the, threat, to, the, animal, through, intense, eye, contact, loud, shouting, and, any, other, action, to, appear, larger, and, more, menacing, may, make, the, animal, retreat, fighting, back, with, sticks, and, rocks, or, even, bare, hands, is, often, effective, in, persuading, an, attacking, cougar, to, disengage, when, cougars, do, attack, they, usually, employ, their, characteristic, neck, bite, attempting, to, position, their, teeth, between, the, vertebrae, and, into, the, spinal, cord, neck, head, and, spinal, injuries, are, common, and, sometimes, fatal, children, are, at, greatest, risk, of, attack, and, least, likely, to, survive, an, encounter, detailed, research, into, attacks, before, 1991, showed, that, 64, of, all, victims, and, almost, all, fatalities, were, children, the, same, study, showed, the, highest, proportion, of, attacks, to, have, occurred, in, british, columbia, particularly, on, vancouver, island, where, cougar, populations, are, especially, dense, preceding, attacks, on, humans, cougars, display, aberrant, behavior, such, as, activity, during, daylight, hours, a, lack, of, fear, of, humans, and, stalking, humans, there, have, sometimes, been, incidents, of, pet, cougars, mauling, people, research, on, new, wildlife, collars, may, reduce, human, animal, conflicts, by, predicting, when, and, where, predatory, animals, hunt, this, may, save, the, lives, of, humans, pets, and, livestock, as, well, as, the, lives, of, these, large, predatory, mammals, that, are, important, to, the, balance, of, ecosystems, cougars, in, the, southern, cone, of, south, america, are, reputed, to, be, extremely, reluctant, to, attack, people, in, legend, they, defended, people, against, jaguars, the, nineteenth, century, naturalists, f, lix, de, azara, and, william, henry, hudson, thought, that, attacks, on, people, even, children, or, sleeping, adults, did, not, happen, hudson, citing, anecdotal, evidence, from, hunters, claimed, that, pumas, were, positively, inhibited, from, attacking, people, even, in, self, defense, attacks, on, humans, although, exceedingly, rare, have, occurred, an, early, authenticated, non, fatal, case, occurred, near, lake, viedma, patagonia, in, 1877, when, a, female, mauled, the, argentine, scientist, francisco, p, moreno, moreno, afterward, showed, the, scars, to, theodore, roosevelt, in, this, instance, however, moreno, had, been, wearing, a, guanaco, hide, poncho, round, his, neck, and, head, as, protection, against, the, cold, in, patagonia, the, guanaco, is, the, puma, s, chief, prey, animal, another, authenticated, case, occurred, in, 1997, in, iguaz, national, park, in, northeastern, argentina, when, the, 20, month, old, son, of, a, ranger, was, killed, by, a, female, puma, forensic, analysis, found, specimens, of, the, child, s, hair, and, clothing, fibers, in, the, animal, s, stomach, the, coat, is, the, puma, s, chief, prey, in, this, area, despite, prohibitory, signs, coatis, are, hand, fed, by, tourists, in, the, park, causing, unnatural, approximation, between, cougars, and, humans, this, particular, puma, had, been, raised, in, captivity, and, released, into, the, wild, on, march, 13, 2012, erica, cruz, a, 23, year, old, shepherdess, was, found, dead, in, a, mountainous, area, near, rosario, de, lerma, salta, province, in, northwestern, argentina, claw, incisions, which, severed, a, jugular, vein, indicated, that, the, attacker, was, a, felid, differential, diagnosis, ruled, out, other, possible, perpetrators, there, were, no, bite, marks, on, the, victim, who, had, been, herding, goats, in, 2019, in, c, rdoba, province, argentina, an, elderly, man, was, badly, injured, by, a, cougar, after, he, attempted, to, defend, his, dog, from, it, while, in, neighboring, chile, a, 28, year, old, woman, was, attacked, and, killed, in, corral, in, los, r, os, region, on, october, 20, 2020, fatal, attacks, by, other, carnivores, such, as, feral, dogs, can, be, misattributed, to, cougars, without, appropriate, forensic, knowledge, during, the, early, years, of, ranching, cougars, were, considered, on, par, with, wolves, in, destructiveness, according, to, figures, in, texas, in, 1990, 86, calves, 0, 0006, of, texas, s, 13, 4, million, cattle, and, calves, 253, mohair, goats, 302, mohair, kids, 445, sheep, 0, 02, of, texas, s, 2, million, sheep, and, lambs, and, 562, lambs, 0, 04, of, texas, s, 1, 2, million, lambs, were, confirmed, to, have, been, killed, by, cougars, that, year, in, nevada, in, 1992, cougars, were, confirmed, to, have, killed, nine, calves, one, horse, four, foals, five, goats, 318, sheep, and, 400, lambs, in, both, reports, sheep, were, the, most, frequently, attacked, some, instances, of, surplus, killing, have, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, 20, sheep, in, one, attack, a, cougar, s, killing, bite, is, applied, to, the, back, of, the, neck, head, or, throat, and, the, cat, inflicts, puncture, marks, with, its, claws, usually, seen, on, the, sides, and, underside, of, the, prey, sometimes, also, shredding, the, prey, as, it, holds, on, coyotes, also, typically, bite, the, throat, but, the, work, of, a, cougar, is, generally, clean, while, bites, inflicted, by, coyotes, and, dogs, leave, ragged, edges, the, size, of, the, tooth, puncture, marks, also, helps, distinguish, kills, made, by, cougars, from, those, made, by, smaller, predators, remedial, hunting, appears, to, have, the, paradoxical, effect, of, increased, livestock, predation, and, complaints, of, human, cougar, conflicts, in, a, 2013, study, the, most, important, predictor, of, cougar, problems, was, the, remedial, hunting, of, cougars, the, previous, year, each, additional, cougar, on, the, landscape, increased, predation, and, human, cougar, complaints, by, 5, but, each, animal, killed, during, the, previous, year, increased, complaints, by, 50, the, effect, had, a, dose, response, relationship, with, very, heavy, 100, removal, of, adult, cougars, remedial, hunting, leading, to, a, 150, 340, increase, in, livestock, and, human, conflicts, this, effect, is, attributed, to, the, removal, of, older, cougars, that, have, learned, to, avoid, people, and, their, replacement, by, younger, males, that, react, differently, to, humans, remedial, hunting, enables, younger, males, to, enter, the, former, territories, of, the, older, animals, predation, by, cougars, on, dogs, is, widespread, but, occurs, at, low, frequencies, the, grace, and, power, of, the, cougar, have, been, widely, admired, in, the, cultures, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, the, inca, city, of, cusco, is, reported, to, have, been, designed, in, the, shape, of, a, cougar, and, the, animal, also, gave, its, name, to, both, inca, regions, and, people, the, moche, people, often, represented, the, cougar, in, their, ceramics, the, sky, and, thunder, god, of, the, inca, viracocha, has, been, associated, with, the, animal, in, north, america, mythological, descriptions, of, the, cougar, have, appeared, in, the, stories, of, the, hoc, k, language, ho, chunk, or, winnebago, of, wisconsin, and, illinois, and, the, cheyenne, among, others, to, the, apache, and, walapai, of, the, southwestern, united, states, the, wail, of, the, cougar, was, a, harbinger, of, death, the, algonquins, and, ojibwe, believe, that, the, cougar, lived, in, the, underworld, and, was, wicked, whereas, it, was, a, sacred, animal, among, the, cherokee
