leprosy, also, known, as, hansen, s, disease, hd, is, a, long, term, infection, by, the, bacteria, mycobacterium, leprae, or, mycobacterium, lepromatosis, infection, can, lead, to, damage, of, the, nerves, respiratory, tract, skin, and, eyes, this, nerve, damage, may, result, in, a, lack, of, ability, to, feel, pain, which, can, lead, to, the, loss, of, parts, of, a, person, s, extremities, from, repeated, injuries, or, infection, through, unnoticed, wounds, an, infected, person, may, also, experience, muscle, weakness, and, poor, eyesight, leprosy, symptoms, may, begin, within, one, year, but, for, some, people, symptoms, may, take, 20, years, or, more, to, occur, leprosy, is, spread, between, people, although, extensive, contact, is, necessary, leprosy, has, a, low, pathogenicity, and, 95, of, people, who, contract, m, leprae, do, not, develop, the, disease, spread, is, thought, to, occur, through, a, cough, or, contact, with, fluid, from, the, nose, of, a, person, infected, by, leprosy, genetic, factors, and, immune, function, play, a, role, in, how, easily, a, person, catches, the, disease, leprosy, does, not, spread, during, pregnancy, to, the, unborn, child, or, through, sexual, contact, leprosy, occurs, more, commonly, among, people, living, in, poverty, there, are, two, main, types, of, the, disease, paucibacillary, and, multibacillary, which, differ, in, the, number, of, bacteria, present, a, person, with, paucibacillary, disease, has, five, or, fewer, poorly, pigmented, numb, skin, patches, while, a, person, with, multibacillary, disease, has, more, than, five, skin, patches, the, diagnosis, is, confirmed, by, finding, acid, fast, bacilli, in, a, biopsy, of, the, skin, leprosy, is, curable, with, multidrug, therapy, treatment, of, paucibacillary, leprosy, is, with, the, medications, dapsone, rifampicin, and, clofazimine, for, six, months, treatment, for, multibacillary, leprosy, uses, the, same, medications, for, 12, months, a, number, of, other, antibiotics, may, also, be, used, these, treatments, are, provided, free, of, charge, by, the, world, health, organization, leprosy, is, not, highly, contagious, people, with, leprosy, can, live, with, their, families, and, go, to, school, and, work, in, the, 1980s, there, were, 5, 2, million, cases, globally, but, by, 2020, this, decreased, to, fewer, than, 200, 000, most, new, cases, occur, in, 14, countries, with, india, accounting, for, more, than, half, in, the, 20, years, from, 1994, to, 2014, 16, million, people, worldwide, were, cured, of, leprosy, about, 200, cases, per, year, are, reported, in, the, united, states, central, florida, accounted, for, 81, of, cases, in, florida, and, nearly, 1, out, of, 5, leprosy, cases, nationwide, separating, people, affected, by, leprosy, by, placing, them, in, leper, colonies, still, occurs, in, some, areas, of, india, china, africa, and, thailand, leprosy, has, affected, humanity, for, thousands, of, years, the, disease, takes, its, name, from, the, greek, word, l, pra, from, lep, s, scale, while, the, term, hansen, s, disease, is, named, after, the, norwegian, physician, gerhard, armauer, hansen, leprosy, has, historically, been, associated, with, social, stigma, which, continues, to, be, a, barrier, to, self, reporting, and, early, treatment, leprosy, is, classified, as, a, neglected, tropical, disease, world, leprosy, day, was, started, in, 1954, to, draw, awareness, to, those, affected, by, leprosy, common, symptoms, present, in, the, different, types, of, leprosy, include, a, runny, nose, dry, scalp, eye, problems, skin, lesions, muscle, weakness, reddish, skin, smooth, shiny, diffuse, thickening, of, facial, skin, ear, and, hand, loss, of, sensation, in, fingers, and, toes, thickening, of, peripheral, nerves, a, flat, nose, from, destruction, of, nasal, cartilages, and, changes, in, phonation, and, other, aspects, of, speech, production, in, addition, atrophy, of, the, testes, and, impotence, may, occur, leprosy, can, affect, people, in, different, ways, the, average, incubation, period, is, five, years, people, may, begin, to, notice, symptoms, within, the, first, year, or, up, to, 20, years, after, infection, the, first, noticeable, sign, of, leprosy, is, often, the, development, of, pale, or, pink, coloured, patches, of, skin, that, may, be, insensitive, to, temperature, or, pain, patches, of, discolored, skin, are, sometimes, accompanied, or, preceded, by, nerve, problems, including, numbness, or, tenderness, in, the, hands, or, feet, secondary, infections, additional, bacterial, or, viral, infections, can, result, in, tissue, loss, causing, fingers, and, toes, to, become, shortened, and, deformed, as, cartilage, is, absorbed, into, the, body, a, person, s, immune, response, differs, depending, on, the, form, of, leprosy, approximately, 30, of, people, affected, with, leprosy, experience, nerve, damage, the, nerve, damage, sustained, is, reversible, when, treated, early, but, becomes, permanent, when, appropriate, treatment, is, delayed, by, several, months, damage, to, nerves, may, cause, loss, of, muscle, function, leading, to, paralysis, it, may, also, lead, to, sensation, abnormalities, or, numbness, which, may, lead, to, additional, infections, ulcerations, and, joint, deformities, m, leprae, and, m, lepromatosis, are, the, mycobacteria, that, cause, leprosy, m, lepromatosis, is, a, relatively, newly, identified, mycobacterium, isolated, from, a, fatal, case, of, diffuse, lepromatous, leprosy, in, 2008, m, lepromatosis, is, indistinguishable, clinically, from, m, leprae, m, leprae, is, an, intracellular, acid, fast, bacterium, that, is, aerobic, and, rod, shaped, m, leprae, is, surrounded, by, the, waxy, cell, envelope, coating, characteristic, of, the, genus, mycobacterium, genetically, m, leprae, and, m, lepromatosis, lack, the, genes, that, are, necessary, for, independent, growth, m, leprae, and, m, lepromatosis, are, obligate, intracellular, pathogens, and, cannot, be, grown, cultured, in, the, laboratory, the, inability, to, culture, m, leprae, and, m, lepromatosis, creates, difficulty, definitively, identifying, the, bacterial, organism, under, a, strict, interpretation, of, koch, s, postulates, while, the, causative, organisms, have, to, date, been, impossible, to, culture, in, vitro, it, has, been, possible, to, grow, them, in, animals, such, as, mice, and, armadillos, naturally, occurring, infection, has, been, reported, in, nonhuman, primates, including, the, african, chimpanzee, the, sooty, mangabey, and, the, cynomolgus, macaque, armadillos, and, red, squirrels, multilocus, sequence, typing, of, the, armadillo, m, leprae, strains, suggests, that, they, were, of, human, origin, for, at, most, a, few, hundred, years, thus, it, is, suspected, that, armadillos, first, acquired, the, organism, incidentally, from, early, european, explorers, of, the, americas, this, incidental, transmission, was, sustained, in, the, armadillo, population, and, it, may, be, transmitted, back, to, humans, making, leprosy, a, zoonotic, disease, spread, between, humans, and, animals, red, squirrels, sciurus, vulgaris, a, threatened, species, in, great, britain, were, found, to, carry, leprosy, in, november, 2016, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, trade, in, red, squirrel, fur, highly, prized, in, the, medieval, period, and, intensively, traded, may, have, been, responsible, for, the, leprosy, epidemic, in, medieval, europe, a, pre, norman, era, skull, excavated, in, hoxne, suffolk, in, 2017, was, found, to, carry, dna, from, a, strain, of, mycobacterium, leprae, which, closely, matched, the, strain, carried, by, modern, red, squirrels, on, brownsea, island, uk, the, greatest, risk, factor, for, developing, leprosy, is, contact, with, another, person, infected, by, leprosy, people, who, are, exposed, to, a, person, who, has, leprosy, are, 5, 8, times, more, likely, to, develop, leprosy, than, members, of, the, general, population, leprosy, also, occurs, more, commonly, among, those, living, in, poverty, not, all, people, who, are, infected, with, m, leprae, develop, symptoms, conditions, that, reduce, immune, function, such, as, malnutrition, other, illnesses, or, genetic, mutations, may, increase, the, risk, of, developing, leprosy, infection, with, hiv, does, not, appear, to, increase, the, risk, of, developing, leprosy, certain, genetic, factors, in, the, person, exposed, have, been, associated, with, developing, lepromatous, or, tuberculoid, leprosy, transmission, of, leprosy, occurs, during, close, contact, with, those, who, are, infected, transmission, of, leprosy, is, through, the, upper, respiratory, tract, older, research, suggested, the, skin, as, the, main, route, of, transmission, but, research, has, increasingly, favored, the, respiratory, route, transmission, occurs, through, inhalation, of, bacilli, present, in, upper, airway, secretion, leprosy, is, not, sexually, transmitted, and, is, not, spread, through, pregnancy, to, the, unborn, child, the, majority, 95, of, people, who, are, exposed, to, m, leprae, do, not, develop, leprosy, casual, contact, such, as, shaking, hands, and, sitting, next, to, someone, with, leprosy, does, not, lead, to, transmission, people, are, considered, non, infectious, 72, hours, after, starting, appropriate, multi, drug, therapy, two, exit, routes, of, m, leprae, from, the, human, body, often, described, are, the, skin, and, the, nasal, mucosa, although, their, relative, importance, is, not, clear, lepromatous, cases, show, large, numbers, of, organisms, deep, in, the, dermis, but, whether, they, reach, the, skin, surface, in, sufficient, numbers, is, doubtful, leprosy, may, also, be, transmitted, to, humans, by, armadillos, although, the, mechanism, is, not, fully, understood, not, all, people, who, are, infected, or, exposed, to, m, leprae, develop, leprosy, and, genetic, factors, are, suspected, to, play, a, role, in, susceptibility, to, an, infection, cases, of, leprosy, often, cluster, in, families, and, several, genetic, variants, have, been, identified, in, many, people, who, are, exposed, the, immune, system, is, able, to, eliminate, the, leprosy, bacteria, during, the, early, infection, stage, before, severe, symptoms, develop, a, genetic, defect, in, cell, mediated, immunity, may, cause, a, person, to, be, susceptible, to, develop, leprosy, symptoms, after, exposure, to, the, bacteria, the, region, of, dna, responsible, for, this, variability, is, also, involved, in, parkinson, s, disease, giving, rise, to, current, speculation, that, the, two, disorders, may, be, linked, at, the, biochemical, level, most, leprosy, complications, are, the, result, of, nerve, damage, the, nerve, damage, occurs, from, direct, invasion, by, the, m, leprae, bacteria, and, a, person, s, immune, response, resulting, in, inflammation, the, molecular, mechanism, underlying, how, m, leprae, produces, the, symptoms, of, leprosy, is, not, clear, but, m, leprae, has, been, shown, to, bind, to, schwann, cells, which, may, lead, to, nerve, injury, including, demyelination, and, a, loss, of, nerve, function, specifically, a, loss, of, axonal, conductance, numerous, molecular, mechanisms, have, been, associated, with, this, nerve, damage, including, the, presence, of, a, laminin, binding, protein, and, the, glycoconjugate, pgl, 1, on, the, surface, of, m, leprae, that, can, bind, to, laminin, on, peripheral, nerves, as, part, of, the, human, immune, response, white, blood, cell, derived, macrophages, may, engulf, m, leprae, by, phagocytosis, in, the, initial, stages, small, sensory, and, autonomic, nerve, fibers, in, the, skin, of, a, person, with, leprosy, are, damaged, this, damage, usually, results, in, hair, loss, to, the, area, a, loss, of, the, ability, to, sweat, and, numbness, decreased, ability, to, detect, sensations, such, as, temperature, and, touch, further, peripheral, nerve, damage, may, result, in, skin, dryness, more, numbness, and, muscle, weaknesses, or, paralysis, in, the, area, affected, the, skin, can, crack, and, if, the, skin, injuries, are, not, carefully, cared, for, there, is, a, risk, for, a, secondary, infection, that, can, lead, to, more, severe, damage, in, countries, where, people, are, frequently, infected, a, person, is, considered, to, have, leprosy, if, they, have, one, of, the, following, two, signs, skin, lesions, can, be, single, or, many, and, usually, hypopigmented, although, occasionally, reddish, or, copper, colored, the, lesions, may, be, flat, macules, raised, papules, or, solid, elevated, areas, nodular, experiencing, sensory, loss, at, the, skin, lesion, is, a, feature, that, can, help, determine, if, the, lesion, is, caused, by, leprosy, or, by, another, disorder, such, as, tinea, versicolor, thickened, nerves, are, associated, with, leprosy, and, can, be, accompanied, by, loss, of, sensation, or, muscle, weakness, but, muscle, weakness, without, the, characteristic, skin, lesion, and, sensory, loss, is, not, considered, a, reliable, sign, of, leprosy, in, some, cases, acid, fast, leprosy, bacilli, in, skin, smears, are, considered, diagnostic, however, the, diagnosis, is, typically, made, without, laboratory, tests, based, on, symptoms, if, a, person, has, a, new, leprosy, diagnosis, and, already, has, a, visible, disability, caused, by, leprosy, the, diagnosis, is, considered, late, in, countries, or, areas, where, leprosy, is, uncommon, such, as, the, united, states, diagnosis, of, leprosy, is, often, delayed, because, healthcare, providers, are, unaware, of, leprosy, and, its, symptoms, early, diagnosis, and, treatment, prevent, nerve, involvement, the, hallmark, of, leprosy, and, the, disability, it, causes, there, is, no, recommended, test, to, diagnose, latent, leprosy, in, people, without, symptoms, few, people, with, latent, leprosy, test, positive, for, anti, pgl, 1, the, presence, of, m, leprae, bacterial, dna, can, be, identified, using, a, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, based, technique, this, molecular, test, alone, is, not, sufficient, to, diagnose, a, person, but, this, approach, may, be, used, to, identify, someone, who, is, at, high, risk, of, developing, or, transmitting, leprosy, such, as, those, with, few, lesions, or, an, atypical, clinical, presentation, new, approaches, propose, tools, to, diagnose, leprosy, through, artificial, intelligence, several, different, approaches, for, classifying, leprosy, exist, there, are, similarities, between, the, classification, approaches, leprosy, may, also, occur, with, only, neural, involvement, without, skin, lesions, leprosy, may, cause, the, victim, to, lose, limbs, and, digits, but, not, directly, m, leprae, attacks, nerve, endings, and, destroys, the, body, s, ability, to, feel, pain, and, injury, without, feeling, pain, people, with, leprosy, have, an, increased, risk, of, injuring, themselves, injuries, become, infected, and, result, in, tissue, loss, fingers, toes, and, limbs, become, shortened, and, deformed, as, the, tissue, is, absorbed, into, the, body, early, detection, of, the, disease, is, important, since, physical, and, neurological, damage, may, be, irreversible, even, if, cured, medications, can, decrease, the, risk, of, those, living, with, people, who, have, leprosy, from, acquiring, the, disease, and, likely, those, with, whom, people, with, leprosy, come, into, contact, outside, the, home, the, who, recommends, that, preventive, medicine, be, given, to, people, who, are, in, close, contact, with, someone, who, has, leprosy, the, suggested, preventive, treatment, is, a, single, dose, of, rifampicin, sdr, in, adults, and, children, over, 2, years, old, who, do, not, already, have, leprosy, or, tuberculosis, preventive, treatment, is, associated, with, a, 57, reduction, in, infections, within, 2, years, and, a, 30, reduction, in, infections, within, 6, years, the, bacillus, calmette, gu, rin, bcg, vaccine, offers, a, variable, amount, of, protection, against, leprosy, in, addition, to, its, closely, related, target, of, tuberculosis, it, appears, to, be, 26, to, 41, effective, based, on, controlled, trials, and, about, 60, effective, based, on, observational, studies, with, two, doses, possibly, working, better, than, one, the, who, concluded, in, 2018, that, the, bcg, vaccine, at, birth, reduces, leprosy, risk, and, is, recommended, in, countries, with, high, incidence, of, tb, and, people, who, have, leprosy, people, living, in, the, same, home, as, a, person, with, leprosy, are, suggested, to, take, a, bcg, booster, which, may, improve, their, immunity, by, 56, development, of, a, more, effective, vaccine, is, ongoing, a, novel, vaccine, called, lepvax, entered, clinical, trials, in, 2017, with, the, first, encouraging, results, reported, on, 24, participants, published, in, 2020, if, successful, this, would, be, the, first, leprosy, specific, vaccine, available, a, number, of, leprostatic, agents, are, available, for, treatment, a, three, drug, regimen, of, rifampicin, dapsone, and, clofazimine, is, recommended, for, all, people, with, leprosy, for, six, months, for, paucibacillary, leprosy, and, 12, months, for, multibacillary, leprosy, multidrug, therapy, mdt, remains, highly, effective, and, people, are, no, longer, infectious, after, the, first, monthly, dose, it, is, safe, and, easy, to, use, under, field, conditions, because, of, its, presentation, in, calendar, blister, packs, post, treatment, relapse, rates, remain, low, resistance, has, been, reported, in, several, countries, although, the, number, of, cases, is, small, people, with, rifampicin, resistant, leprosy, may, be, treated, with, second, line, drugs, such, as, fluoroquinolones, minocycline, or, clarithromycin, but, the, treatment, duration, is, 24, months, because, of, their, lower, bactericidal, activity, evidence, on, the, potential, benefits, and, harms, of, alternative, regimens, for, drug, resistant, leprosy, is, not, available, for, people, with, nerve, damage, protective, footwear, may, help, prevent, ulcers, and, secondary, infection, canvas, shoes, may, be, better, than, pvc, boots, there, may, be, no, difference, between, double, rocker, shoes, and, below, knee, plaster, topical, ketanserin, seems, to, have, a, better, effect, on, ulcer, healing, than, clioquinol, cream, or, zinc, paste, but, the, evidence, for, this, is, weak, phenytoin, applied, to, the, skin, improves, skin, changes, to, a, greater, degree, when, compared, to, saline, dressings, although, leprosy, has, been, curable, since, the, mid, 20th, century, left, untreated, it, can, cause, permanent, physical, impairments, and, damage, to, a, person, s, nerves, skin, eyes, and, limbs, despite, leprosy, not, being, very, infectious, and, having, a, low, pathogenicity, there, is, still, significant, stigma, and, prejudice, associated, with, the, disease, because, of, this, stigma, leprosy, can, affect, a, person, s, participation, in, social, activities, and, may, also, affect, the, lives, of, their, family, and, friends, people, with, leprosy, are, also, at, a, higher, risk, for, problems, with, their, mental, well, being, the, social, stigma, may, contribute, to, problems, obtaining, employment, financial, difficulties, and, social, isolation, efforts, to, reduce, discrimination, and, reduce, the, stigma, surrounding, leprosy, may, help, improve, outcomes, for, people, with, leprosy, in, 2018, there, were, 208, 619, new, cases, of, leprosy, recorded, a, slight, decrease, from, 2017, in, 2015, 94, of, the, new, leprosy, cases, were, confined, to, 14, countries, india, reported, the, greatest, number, of, new, cases, 60, of, reported, cases, followed, by, brazil, 13, and, indonesia, 8, although, the, number, of, cases, worldwide, continues, to, fall, there, are, parts, of, the, world, where, leprosy, is, more, common, including, brazil, south, asia, india, nepal, bhutan, some, parts, of, africa, tanzania, madagascar, mozambique, and, the, western, pacific, about, 150, to, 250, cases, are, diagnosed, in, the, united, states, each, year, in, the, 1960s, there, were, tens, of, millions, of, leprosy, cases, recorded, when, the, bacteria, started, to, develop, resistance, to, dapsone, the, most, common, treatment, option, at, the, time, international, e, g, the, who, s, global, strategy, for, reducing, disease, burden, due, to, leprosy, and, national, e, g, the, international, federation, of, anti, leprosy, associations, initiatives, have, reduced, the, total, number, and, the, number, of, new, cases, of, the, disease, the, number, of, new, leprosy, cases, is, difficult, to, measure, and, monitor, because, of, leprosy, s, long, incubation, period, delays, in, diagnosis, after, onset, of, the, disease, and, lack, of, medical, care, in, affected, areas, the, registered, prevalence, of, the, disease, is, used, to, determine, disease, burden, registered, prevalence, is, a, useful, proxy, indicator, of, the, disease, burden, as, it, reflects, the, number, of, active, leprosy, cases, diagnosed, with, the, disease, and, receiving, treatment, with, mdt, at, a, given, point, in, time, the, prevalence, rate, is, defined, as, the, number, of, cases, registered, for, mdt, treatment, among, the, population, in, which, the, cases, have, occurred, again, at, a, given, point, in, time, using, comparative, genomics, in, 2005, geneticists, traced, the, origins, and, worldwide, distribution, of, leprosy, from, east, africa, or, the, near, east, along, human, migration, routes, they, found, four, strains, of, m, leprae, with, specific, regional, locations, monot, et, al, 2005, determined, that, leprosy, originated, in, east, africa, or, the, near, east, and, traveled, with, humans, along, their, migration, routes, including, those, of, trade, in, goods, and, slaves, the, four, strains, of, m, leprae, are, based, in, specific, geographic, regions, where, each, predominantly, occurs, this, confirms, the, spread, of, the, disease, along, the, migration, colonisation, and, slave, trade, routes, taken, from, east, africa, to, india, west, africa, to, the, new, world, and, from, africa, into, europe, and, vice, versa, skeletal, remains, discovered, in, 2009, represent, the, oldest, documented, evidence, for, leprosy, dating, to, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, located, at, balathal, rajasthan, in, northwest, india, the, discoverers, suggest, that, if, the, disease, did, migrate, from, africa, to, india, during, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, at, a, time, when, there, was, substantial, interaction, among, the, indus, civilization, mesopotamia, and, egypt, there, needs, to, be, additional, skeletal, and, molecular, evidence, of, leprosy, in, india, and, africa, to, confirm, the, african, origin, of, the, disease, a, proven, human, case, was, verified, by, dna, taken, from, the, shrouded, remains, of, a, man, discovered, by, researchers, from, the, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, in, a, tomb, in, akeldama, next, to, the, old, city, of, jerusalem, israel, dated, by, radiocarbon, methods, to, the, first, half, of, the, 1st, century, the, oldest, strains, of, leprosy, known, from, europe, are, from, great, chesterford, in, southeast, england, and, dating, back, to, ad, 415, 545, these, findings, suggest, a, different, path, for, the, spread, of, leprosy, meaning, it, may, have, originated, in, western, eurasia, this, study, also, indicates, that, there, were, more, strains, in, europe, at, the, time, than, previously, determined, literary, attestation, of, leprosy, is, unclear, because, of, the, ambiguity, of, many, early, sources, including, the, indian, atharvaveda, and, kausika, sutra, the, egyptian, ebers, papyrus, and, the, hebrew, bible, s, various, sections, regarding, signs, of, impurity, tzaraath, clearly, leprotic, symptoms, are, attested, in, the, indian, doctor, sushruta, s, compendium, originally, dating, to, c, 600, bc, but, only, surviving, in, emended, texts, no, earlier, than, the, 5th, century, they, were, separately, described, by, hippocrates, in, 460, bc, however, hansen, s, disease, probably, did, not, exist, in, greece, or, the, middle, east, before, the, common, era, in, 1846, francis, adams, produced, the, seven, books, of, paulus, aegineta, which, included, a, commentary, on, all, medical, and, surgical, knowledge, and, descriptions, and, remedies, to, do, with, leprosy, from, the, romans, greeks, and, arabs, leprosy, did, not, exist, in, the, americas, before, colonization, by, modern, europeans, nor, did, it, exist, in, polynesia, until, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, the, causative, agent, of, leprosy, m, leprae, was, discovered, by, gerhard, armauer, hansen, in, norway, in, 1873, making, it, the, first, bacterium, to, be, identified, as, causing, disease, in, humans, chaulmoogra, tree, oil, was, used, topically, to, manage, hansen, s, disease, for, centuries, chaulmoogra, oil, could, not, be, taken, orally, without, causing, nausea, or, injected, without, forming, an, abscess, in, 1915, alice, ball, the, first, black, woman, to, graduate, from, the, university, of, hawai, i, with, a, masters, in, chemistry, discovered, how, to, make, the, oil, water, soluble, this, technique, led, to, marked, improvements, in, patients, with, hansen, s, disease, who, were, treated, in, hawai, i, the, first, effective, drug, promin, became, available, in, the, 1940s, in, the, 1950s, dapsone, was, introduced, the, search, for, further, effective, antileprosy, drugs, led, to, the, use, of, clofazimine, and, rifampicin, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, later, indian, scientist, shantaram, yawalkar, and, his, colleagues, formulated, a, combined, therapy, using, rifampicin, and, dapsone, intended, to, mitigate, bacterial, resistance, multi, drug, therapy, mdt, combining, all, three, drugs, was, first, recommended, by, the, who, in, 1981, these, three, antileprosy, drugs, are, still, used, in, the, standard, mdt, regimens, leprosy, was, once, believed, to, be, highly, contagious, and, was, treated, with, mercury, as, was, syphilis, which, was, first, described, in, 1530, many, early, cases, thought, to, be, leprosy, could, actually, have, been, syphilis, resistance, has, developed, to, initial, treatment, until, the, introduction, of, mdt, in, the, early, 1980s, leprosy, could, not, be, diagnosed, and, treated, successfully, within, the, community, japan, still, has, sanatoriums, although, japan, s, sanatoriums, no, longer, have, active, leprosy, cases, nor, are, survivors, held, in, them, by, law, the, importance, of, the, nasal, mucosa, in, the, transmission, of, m, leprae, was, recognized, as, early, as, 1898, by, sch, ffer, in, particular, that, of, the, ulcerated, mucosa, the, mechanism, of, plantar, ulceration, in, leprosy, and, its, treatment, was, first, described, by, ernest, w, price, the, word, leprosy, comes, from, the, greek, word, l, pos, skin, and, leper, s, scaly, man, between, 1995, and, 1999, the, who, with, the, aid, of, the, nippon, foundation, supplied, all, endemic, countries, with, free, multidrug, therapy, in, blister, packs, channeled, through, ministries, of, health, this, free, provision, was, extended, in, 2000, and, again, in, 2005, 2010, and, 2015, with, donations, by, the, multidrug, therapy, manufacturer, novartis, through, the, who, in, the, latest, agreement, signed, between, the, company, and, the, who, in, october, 2015, the, provision, of, free, multidrug, therapy, by, the, who, to, all, endemic, countries, will, run, until, the, end, of, 2025, at, the, national, level, nongovernment, organizations, affiliated, with, the, national, program, will, continue, to, be, provided, with, an, appropriate, free, supply, of, multidrug, therapy, by, the, who, written, accounts, of, leprosy, date, back, thousands, of, years, various, skin, diseases, translated, as, leprosy, appear, in, the, ancient, indian, text, the, atharava, veda, by, 600, bc, another, indian, text, the, manusmriti, 200, bc, prohibited, contact, with, those, infected, with, the, disease, and, made, marriage, to, a, person, infected, with, leprosy, punishable, the, hebraic, root, tsara, or, tsaraath, tsaw, rah, to, be, struck, with, leprosy, to, be, leprous, and, the, greek, lepros, are, of, broader, classification, than, the, more, narrow, use, of, the, term, related, to, hansen, s, disease, any, progressive, skin, disease, a, whitening, or, splotchy, bleaching, of, the, skin, raised, manifestations, of, scales, scabs, infections, rashes, etc, as, well, as, generalized, molds, and, surface, discoloration, of, any, clothing, leather, or, discoloration, on, walls, or, surfaces, throughout, homes, all, came, under, the, law, of, leprosy, leviticus, 14, 54, 57, ancient, sources, such, as, the, talmud, sifra, 63, make, clear, that, tzaraath, refers, to, various, types, of, lesions, or, stains, associated, with, ritual, impurity, and, occurring, on, cloth, leather, or, houses, as, well, as, skin, traditional, judaism, and, jewish, rabbinical, authorities, both, historical, and, modern, emphasize, that, the, tsaraath, of, leviticus, is, a, spiritual, ailment, with, no, direct, relationship, to, hansen, s, disease, or, physical, contagions, the, relation, of, tsaraath, to, leprosy, comes, from, translations, of, hebrew, biblical, texts, into, greek, and, ensuing, misconceptions, all, three, synoptic, gospels, of, the, new, testament, describe, instances, of, jesus, healing, people, with, leprosy, matthew, 8, 1, 4, mark, 1, 40, 45, and, luke, 5, 12, 16, the, bible, s, description, of, leprosy, is, congruous, if, lacking, detail, with, the, symptoms, of, modern, leprosy, but, the, relationship, between, this, disease, tzaraath, and, hansen, s, disease, has, been, disputed, the, biblical, perception, that, people, with, leprosy, were, unclean, can, be, found, in, a, passage, from, leviticus, 13, 44, 46, while, this, text, defines, the, leper, as, impure, it, did, not, explicitly, make, a, moral, judgement, on, those, with, leprosy, some, early, christians, believed, that, those, affected, by, leprosy, were, being, punished, by, god, for, sinful, behavior, moral, associations, have, persisted, throughout, history, pope, gregory, the, great, 540, 604, and, isidore, of, seville, 560, 636, considered, people, with, the, disease, to, be, heretics, the, social, perception, of, leprosy, in, the, general, population, was, in, general, mixed, on, one, hand, people, feared, getting, infected, with, the, disease, and, thought, of, people, suspected, of, leprosy, to, be, unclean, untrustworthy, and, occasionally, morally, corrupt, on, the, other, hand, jesus, interaction, with, lepers, the, writing, of, church, leaders, and, the, christian, focus, on, charitable, works, led, to, viewing, the, lepers, as, chosen, by, god, or, seeing, the, disease, as, a, means, of, obtaining, access, to, heaven, early, medieval, understanding, of, leprosy, was, influenced, by, early, christian, writers, such, as, gregory, of, nazianzus, and, john, chrysostom, whose, writings, were, later, embraced, by, byzantine, and, latin, writers, gregory, for, example, did, not, only, compose, sermons, urging, christians, to, assist, victims, of, the, disease, but, also, condemned, pagans, or, christians, who, justified, rejecting, lepers, on, the, allegation, that, god, had, sent, them, the, disease, to, punish, them, as, cases, of, leprosy, increased, during, these, years, in, the, eastern, roman, empire, becoming, a, major, health, issue, the, ecclesiastic, leaders, of, the, time, discussed, how, to, assist, those, affected, as, well, as, change, the, attitude, of, society, towards, them, they, also, tried, this, by, using, the, name, holy, disease, instead, of, the, commonly, used, elephant, s, disease, elephantiasis, implying, that, god, did, not, create, this, disease, to, punish, people, but, to, purify, them, for, heaven, although, not, always, successful, in, persuading, the, public, and, a, cure, was, never, found, by, greek, medicians, they, created, an, environment, where, victims, could, get, palliative, care, and, were, never, expressly, banned, from, society, as, sometimes, happened, in, western, europe, theodore, balsamon, a, 12th, century, jurist, in, constantinople, noted, that, lepers, were, allowed, to, enter, the, same, churches, cities, and, assemblies, that, healthy, people, attended, as, the, disease, became, more, prevalent, in, western, europe, in, the, fifth, century, efforts, began, to, set, up, permanent, institutions, to, house, and, feed, lepers, these, efforts, were, inclusively, the, work, of, bishops, in, france, at, the, end, of, the, sixth, century, such, as, in, chalon, sur, sa, ne, the, increase, in, hospitals, or, leprosaria, sing, leprosarium, that, treated, people, with, leprosy, in, the, 12th, and, 13th, century, seems, to, indicate, a, rise, in, cases, possibly, in, connection, with, the, increase, in, urbanisation, as, well, as, returning, crusaders, from, the, middle, east, france, alone, had, nearly, 2, 000, leprosaria, during, this, period, additionally, to, the, new, leprosia, further, steps, were, taken, by, secular, and, religious, leaders, to, prevent, further, spread, of, the, disease, the, third, lateran, council, of, 1179, required, lepers, to, have, their, own, priests, and, churches, and, a, 1346, edict, by, king, edward, expelled, lepers, from, city, limits, segregation, from, mainstream, society, became, common, and, people, with, leprosy, were, often, required, to, wear, clothing, that, identified, them, as, such, or, carry, a, bell, announcing, their, presence, as, in, the, east, it, was, the, church, who, took, care, of, the, lepers, due, to, the, still, persisting, moral, stigma, and, who, ran, the, leprosaria, although, the, leprosaria, in, western, europe, removed, the, sick, from, society, they, were, never, a, place, to, quarantine, them, or, from, which, they, could, not, leave, lepers, would, go, beg, for, alms, for, the, upkeep, of, the, leprosaria, or, meet, with, their, families, multiple, groups, in, western, europe, from, the, middle, ages, faced, social, ostracization, and, discrimination, that, was, justified, in, part, due, to, claims, that, they, were, the, descendants, of, lepers, these, groups, included, the, cagots, and, the, caquins, norway, was, the, location, of, a, progressive, stance, on, leprosy, tracking, and, treatment, and, played, an, influential, role, in, european, understanding, of, the, disease, in, 1832, dr, jj, hjort, conducted, the, first, leprosy, survey, thus, establishing, a, basis, for, epidemiological, surveys, subsequent, surveys, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, a, national, leprosy, registry, to, study, the, causes, of, leprosy, and, for, tracking, the, rate, of, infection, early, leprosy, research, throughout, europe, was, conducted, by, norwegian, scientists, daniel, cornelius, danielssen, and, carl, wilhelm, boeck, their, work, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, the, national, leprosy, research, and, treatment, center, danielssen, and, boeck, believed, the, cause, of, leprosy, transmission, was, hereditary, this, stance, was, influential, in, advocating, for, the, isolation, of, those, infected, by, sex, to, prevent, reproduction, though, leprosy, rates, were, again, on, the, decline, in, the, western, world, by, the, 1860s, authorities, in, the, west, frequently, embraced, isolation, treatment, due, to, a, combination, of, reasons, including, fears, of, the, disease, spreading, from, the, global, south, efforts, by, christian, missionaries, and, a, lack, of, understanding, concerning, bacteriology, medical, diagnosis, and, how, contagious, the, disease, was, the, rapid, expansion, of, western, imperialism, during, the, victorian, era, resulted, in, westerners, coming, into, increasing, contact, with, regions, where, the, disease, was, endemic, including, british, india, english, surgeon, henry, vandyke, carter, observed, isolation, treatment, for, leprosy, patients, first, hand, while, visiting, norway, applying, these, methods, in, british, india, with, the, financial, and, logistical, assistance, of, protestant, missionaries, colonialist, and, religious, viewpoints, of, the, disease, continued, to, be, a, major, factor, in, the, treatment, and, public, perception, of, the, disease, in, the, global, south, until, decolonization, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, in, 1898, the, colonial, government, in, british, india, enacted, the, leprosy, act, of, 1898, which, mandated, the, compulsory, segregation, of, people, with, leprosy, by, authorities, in, newly, established, leper, asylums, where, they, were, segregated, by, sex, to, prevent, sexual, activity, the, act, which, proved, difficult, to, enforce, was, repealed, in, 1983, by, the, indian, government, after, multidrug, therapy, had, become, widely, available, in, india, in, 1983, the, national, leprosy, elimination, programme, previously, the, national, leprosy, control, programme, changed, its, methods, from, surveillance, to, the, treatment, of, people, with, leprosy, india, still, accounts, for, over, half, of, the, global, disease, burden, according, to, who, new, cases, in, india, during, 2019, diminished, to, 114, 451, patients, 57, of, the, world, s, total, new, cases, until, 2019, indians, could, justify, a, petition, for, divorce, with, their, spouse, s, diagnosis, of, leprosy, the, national, leprosarium, at, carville, louisiana, known, in, 1955, as, the, louisiana, leper, home, was, the, only, leprosy, hospital, on, the, mainland, united, states, leprosy, patients, from, all, over, the, united, states, were, sent, to, carville, in, order, to, be, kept, in, isolation, away, from, the, public, as, not, much, about, leprosy, transmission, was, known, at, the, time, and, stigma, against, those, with, leprosy, was, high, see, leprosy, stigma, the, carville, leprosarium, was, known, for, its, innovations, in, reconstructive, surgery, for, those, with, leprosy, in, 1941, 22, patients, at, carville, underwent, trials, for, a, new, drug, called, promin, the, results, were, described, as, miraculous, and, soon, after, the, success, of, promin, came, dapsone, a, medicine, even, more, effective, in, the, fight, against, leprosy, leprosy, incidence, peaked, in, the, united, states, in, 1983, followed, by, a, steep, decline, however, case, numbers, have, been, slowly, rising, again, since, 2000, in, 2020, 159, cases, of, leprosy, were, reported, in, the, country, despite, now, effective, treatment, and, education, efforts, leprosy, stigma, continues, to, be, problematic, in, developing, countries, where, the, disease, is, common, leprosy, is, most, common, amongst, impoverished, populations, where, social, stigma, is, likely, to, be, compounded, by, poverty, fears, of, ostracism, loss, of, employment, or, expulsion, from, family, and, society, may, contribute, to, a, delayed, diagnosis, and, treatment, folk, beliefs, lack, of, education, and, religious, connotations, of, the, disease, continue, to, influence, social, perceptions, of, those, affected, in, many, parts, of, the, world, in, brazil, for, example, folklore, holds, that, leprosy, is, a, disease, transmitted, by, dogs, or, that, it, is, associated, with, sexual, promiscuity, or, that, it, is, a, punishment, for, sins, or, moral, transgressions, distinct, from, other, diseases, and, misfortunes, which, are, in, general, thought, of, as, being, according, to, the, will, of, god, socioeconomic, factors, also, have, a, direct, impact, lower, class, domestic, workers, who, are, often, employed, by, those, in, a, higher, socioeconomic, class, may, find, their, employment, in, jeopardy, as, physical, manifestations, of, the, disease, become, apparent, skin, discoloration, and, darker, pigmentation, resulting, from, the, disease, also, have, social, repercussions, in, extreme, cases, in, northern, india, leprosy, is, equated, with, an, untouchable, status, that, often, persists, long, after, individuals, with, leprosy, have, been, cured, of, the, disease, creating, lifelong, prospects, of, divorce, eviction, loss, of, employment, and, ostracism, from, family, and, social, networks, a, goal, of, the, world, health, organization, is, to, eliminate, leprosy, and, in, 2016, the, organization, launched, global, leprosy, strategy, 2016, 2020, accelerating, towards, a, leprosy, free, world, elimination, of, leprosy, is, defined, as, reducing, the, proportion, of, leprosy, patients, in, the, community, to, very, low, levels, specifically, to, below, one, case, per, 10, 000, population, diagnosis, and, treatment, with, multidrug, therapy, are, effective, and, a, 45, decline, in, disease, burden, has, occurred, since, multidrug, therapy, has, become, more, widely, available, the, organization, emphasizes, the, importance, of, fully, integrating, leprosy, treatment, into, public, health, services, effective, diagnosis, and, treatment, and, access, to, information, the, approach, includes, supporting, an, increase, in, health, care, professionals, who, understand, the, disease, and, a, coordinated, and, renewed, political, commitment, that, includes, coordination, between, countries, and, improvements, in, the, methodology, for, collecting, and, analysing, data, interventions, in, the, global, leprosy, strategy, 2016, 2020, accelerating, towards, a, leprosy, free, world, in, some, instances, in, india, community, based, rehabilitation, is, embraced, by, local, governments, and, ngos, alike, often, the, identity, cultivated, by, a, community, environment, is, preferable, to, reintegration, and, models, of, self, management, and, collective, agency, independent, of, ngos, and, government, support, have, been, desirable, and, successful, wild, nine, banded, armadillos, dasypus, novemcinctus, in, south, central, united, states, often, carry, mycobacterium, leprae, this, is, believed, to, be, because, armadillos, have, a, low, body, temperature, leprosy, lesions, appear, mainly, in, cooler, body, regions, such, as, the, skin, and, mucous, membranes, of, the, upper, respiratory, tract, because, of, armadillos, armor, skin, lesions, are, hard, to, see, abrasions, around, the, eyes, nose, and, feet, are, the, most, common, signs, infected, armadillos, make, up, a, large, reservoir, of, m, leprae, and, may, be, a, source, of, infection, for, some, humans, in, the, united, states, or, other, locations, in, the, armadillos, home, range, in, armadillo, leprosy, lesions, do, not, persist, at, the, site, of, entry, in, animals, m, leprae, multiply, in, macrophages, at, the, site, of, inoculation, and, lymph, nodes, an, outbreak, in, chimpanzees, in, west, africa, is, showing, that, the, bacteria, can, infect, another, species, and, also, possibly, have, additional, rodent, hosts, studies, have, demonstrated, that, the, disease, is, endemic, in, the, uk, red, eurasian, squirrel, population, with, mycobacterium, leprae, and, mycobacterium, lepromatosis, appearing, in, different, populations, the, mycobacteria, leprae, strain, discovered, on, brownsea, island, is, equated, to, one, thought, to, have, died, out, in, the, human, population, in, mediaeval, times, despite, this, and, speculation, regarding, past, transmission, through, trade, in, squirrel, furs, there, does, not, seem, to, be, a, high, risk, of, squirrel, to, human, transmission, from, the, wild, population, although, leprosy, continues, to, be, diagnosed, in, immigrants, to, the, uk, the, last, known, human, case, of, leprosy, arising, in, the, uk, was, recorded, over, 200, years, ago, it, has, been, shown, that, leprosy, can, reprogram, cells, in, mouse, and, armadillo, models, similar, to, how, induced, pluripotent, stem, cells, are, generated, by, the, transcription, factors, myc, oct3, 4, sox2, and, klf4
