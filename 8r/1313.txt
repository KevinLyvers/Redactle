pulmonology, p, l, m, n, l, d, i, p, l, m, n, l, d, i, from, latin, pulm, nis, lung, and, the, greek, suffix, log, a, study, of, pneumology, n, m, l, d, i, n, j, built, on, greek, pne, m, n, lung, or, pneumonology, n, m, n, l, d, i, n, j, is, a, medical, specialty, that, deals, with, diseases, involving, the, respiratory, tract, it, is, also, known, as, respirology, respiratory, medicine, or, chest, medicine, in, some, countries, and, areas, pulmonology, is, considered, a, branch, of, internal, medicine, and, is, related, to, intensive, care, medicine, pulmonology, often, involves, managing, patients, who, need, life, support, and, mechanical, ventilation, pulmonologists, are, specially, trained, in, diseases, and, conditions, of, the, chest, particularly, pneumonia, asthma, tuberculosis, emphysema, and, complicated, chest, infections, pulmonology, respirology, departments, work, especially, closely, with, certain, other, specialties, cardiothoracic, surgery, departments, and, cardiology, departments, one, of, the, first, major, discoveries, relevant, to, the, field, of, pulmonology, was, the, discovery, of, pulmonary, circulation, originally, it, was, thought, that, blood, reaching, the, right, side, of, the, heart, passed, through, small, pores, in, the, septum, into, the, left, side, to, be, oxygenated, as, theorized, by, galen, however, the, discovery, of, pulmonary, circulation, disproves, this, theory, which, had, previously, been, accepted, since, the, 2nd, century, thirteenth, century, anatomist, and, physiologist, ibn, al, nafis, accurately, theorized, that, there, was, no, direct, passage, between, the, two, sides, ventricles, of, the, heart, he, believed, that, the, blood, must, have, passed, through, the, pulmonary, artery, through, the, lungs, and, back, into, the, heart, to, be, pumped, around, the, body, this, is, believed, by, many, to, be, the, first, scientific, description, of, pulmonary, circulation, although, pulmonary, medicine, only, began, to, evolve, as, a, medical, specialty, in, the, 1950s, william, welch, and, william, osler, founded, the, parent, organization, of, the, american, thoracic, society, the, national, association, for, the, study, and, prevention, of, tuberculosis, the, care, treatment, and, study, of, tuberculosis, of, the, lung, is, recognised, as, a, discipline, in, its, own, right, phthisiology, when, the, specialty, did, begin, to, evolve, several, discoveries, were, being, made, linking, the, respiratory, system, and, the, measurement, of, arterial, blood, gases, attracting, more, and, more, physicians, and, researchers, to, the, developing, field, surgery, of, the, respiratory, tract, is, generally, performed, by, specialists, in, cardiothoracic, surgery, or, thoracic, surgery, though, minor, procedures, may, be, performed, by, pulmonologists, pulmonology, is, closely, related, to, critical, care, medicine, when, dealing, with, patients, who, require, mechanical, ventilation, as, a, result, many, pulmonologists, are, certified, to, practice, critical, care, medicine, in, addition, to, pulmonary, medicine, there, are, fellowship, programs, that, allow, physicians, to, become, board, certified, in, pulmonary, and, critical, care, medicine, simultaneously, interventional, pulmonology, is, a, relatively, new, field, within, pulmonary, medicine, that, deals, with, the, use, of, procedures, such, as, bronchoscopy, and, pleuroscopy, to, treat, several, pulmonary, diseases, interventional, pulmonology, is, increasingly, recognized, as, a, specific, medical, specialty, the, pulmonologist, begins, the, diagnostic, process, with, a, general, review, focusing, on, physical, diagnostics, are, as, important, as, in, other, fields, of, medicine, as, many, heart, diseases, can, give, pulmonary, signs, a, thorough, cardiac, investigation, is, usually, included, pulmonary, clinical, procedures, include, the, following, pulmonary, tests, and, procedures, major, surgical, procedures, on, the, heart, and, lungs, are, performed, by, a, thoracic, surgeon, pulmonologists, often, perform, specialized, procedures, to, get, samples, from, the, inside, of, the, chest, or, inside, of, the, lung, they, use, radiographic, techniques, to, view, vasculature, of, the, lungs, and, heart, to, assist, with, diagnosis, medication, is, the, most, important, treatment, of, most, diseases, of, pulmonology, either, by, inhalation, bronchodilators, and, steroids, or, in, oral, form, antibiotics, leukotriene, antagonists, a, common, example, being, the, usage, of, inhalers, in, the, treatment, of, inflammatory, lung, conditions, such, as, asthma, or, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, oxygen, therapy, is, often, necessary, in, severe, respiratory, disease, emphysema, and, pulmonary, fibrosis, when, this, is, insufficient, the, patient, might, require, mechanical, ventilation, pulmonary, rehabilitation, has, been, defined, as, a, multidimensional, continuum, of, services, directed, to, persons, with, pulmonary, disease, and, their, families, usually, by, an, interdisciplinary, team, of, specialists, with, the, goal, of, achieving, and, maintaining, the, individual, s, maximum, level, of, independence, and, functioning, in, the, community, pulmonary, rehabilitation, is, intended, to, educate, the, patient, the, family, and, improve, the, overall, quality, of, life, and, prognosis, for, the, patient, interventions, can, include, exercise, education, emotional, support, oxygen, noninvasive, mechanical, ventilation, optimization, of, airway, secretion, clearance, promoting, compliance, with, medical, care, to, reduce, numbers, of, exacerbations, and, hospitalizations, and, returning, to, work, and, or, a, more, active, and, emotionally, satisfying, life, these, goals, are, appropriate, for, any, patients, with, diminished, respiratory, reserve, whether, due, to, obstructive, or, intrinsic, pulmonary, diseases, oxygenation, impairment, or, neuromuscular, weakness, ventilatory, impairment, a, pulmonary, rehabilitation, team, may, include, a, rehabilitation, physician, a, pulmonary, medicine, specialist, physician, assistant, and, allied, health, professionals, including, a, rehabilitation, nurse, a, respiratory, therapist, a, speech, language, pathologist, a, physical, therapist, an, occupational, therapist, a, psychologist, and, a, social, worker, among, others, additionally, breathing, games, are, used, to, motivate, children, to, perform, pulmonary, rehabilitation, in, the, united, states, pulmonologists, are, physicians, who, after, receiving, a, medical, degree, md, or, do, complete, residency, training, in, internal, medicine, followed, by, at, least, two, additional, years, of, subspeciality, fellowship, training, in, pulmonology, after, satisfactorily, completing, a, fellowship, in, pulmonary, medicine, the, physician, is, permitted, to, take, the, board, certification, examination, in, pulmonary, medicine, after, passing, this, exam, the, physician, is, then, board, certified, as, a, pulmonologist, most, pulmonologists, complete, three, years, of, combined, subspecialty, fellowship, training, in, pulmonary, medicine, and, critical, care, medicine, in, the, united, states, pediatric, pulmonologists, are, physicians, who, after, receiving, a, medical, degree, md, do, mbbs, mbbch, etc, complete, residency, training, in, pediatrics, followed, by, at, least, three, additional, years, of, subspeciality, fellowship, training, in, pulmonology, pediatric, pulmonologists, treat, diseases, of, the, airways, lungs, respiratory, mechanics, and, aerodigestive, system, pulmonologists, are, involved, in, both, clinical, and, basic, research, of, the, respiratory, system, ranging, from, the, anatomy, of, the, respiratory, epithelium, to, the, most, effective, treatment, of, pulmonary, hypertension, scientific, research, also, takes, place, to, look, for, causes, and, possible, treatment, in, diseases, such, as, pulmonary, tuberculosis, and, lung, cancer
