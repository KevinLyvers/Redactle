honeyguides, family, indicatoridae, are, a, family, birds, in, the, order, piciformes, they, are, also, known, as, indicator, birds, or, honey, birds, although, the, latter, term, is, also, used, more, narrowly, to, refer, to, species, of, the, genus, prodotiscus, they, have, an, old, world, tropical, distribution, with, the, greatest, number, of, species, in, africa, and, two, in, asia, these, birds, are, best, known, for, their, interaction, with, humans, honeyguides, are, noted, and, named, for, one, or, two, species, that, will, deliberately, lead, humans, but, contrary, to, popular, claims, most, likely, not, honey, badgers, directly, to, bee, colonies, so, that, they, can, feast, on, the, grubs, and, beeswax, that, are, left, behind, the, indicatoridae, were, noted, for, their, barbet, like, structure, and, brood, parasitic, behavior, and, morphologically, considered, unique, among, the, non, passerines, in, having, nine, primaries, the, phylogenetic, relationship, between, the, honeyguides, and, the, eight, other, families, that, make, up, the, order, piciformes, is, shown, in, the, cladogram, below, the, number, of, species, in, each, family, is, taken, from, the, list, maintained, by, frank, gill, pamela, c, rasmussen, and, david, donsker, on, behalf, of, the, international, ornithological, committee, ioc, galbulidae, jacamars, 18, species, bucconidae, puffbirds, 38, species, indicatoridae, honeyguides, 16, species, picidae, woodpeckers, 240, species, megalaimidae, asian, barbets, 35, species, lybiidae, african, barbets, 42, species, capitonidae, new, world, barbets, 15, species, semnornithidae, toucan, barbets, 2, species, ramphastidae, toucans, 43, species, most, honeyguides, are, dull, colored, though, some, have, bright, yellow, coloring, in, the, plumage, all, have, light, outer, tail, feathers, which, are, white, in, all, the, african, species, the, smallest, species, by, body, mass, appears, to, be, the, green, backed, honeyguide, at, an, average, of, 10, 2, g, 0, 36, oz, and, by, length, appears, to, be, the, cassin, s, honeyguide, at, an, average, of, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, while, the, largest, species, by, weight, is, the, lyre, tailed, honeyguide, at, 54, 2, g, 1, 91, oz, and, by, length, is, the, greater, honeyguide, at, 19, 5, cm, 7, 7, in, they, are, among, the, few, birds, that, feed, regularly, on, wax, beeswax, in, most, species, and, presumably, the, waxy, secretions, of, scale, insects, in, the, genus, prodotiscus, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, melignomon, and, the, smaller, species, of, indicator, they, also, feed, on, waxworms, which, are, the, larvae, of, the, waxmoth, galleria, mellonella, on, bee, colonies, and, on, flying, and, crawling, insects, spiders, and, occasional, fruits, many, species, join, mixed, species, feeding, flocks, honeyguides, are, named, for, a, remarkable, habit, seen, in, one, or, two, species, guiding, humans, to, bee, colonies, once, the, hive, is, open, and, the, honey, is, taken, the, bird, feeds, on, larvae, and, wax, this, behavior, has, been, studied, in, the, greater, honeyguide, some, authorities, following, friedmann, 1955, state, that, it, also, occurs, in, the, scaly, throated, honeyguide, while, others, disagree, wild, honeyguides, understand, various, types, of, human, calls, that, attract, them, to, engage, in, the, foraging, mutualism, in, northern, tanzania, honeyguides, partner, with, hadza, hunter, gatherers, and, the, bird, assistance, has, been, shown, to, increase, honey, hunters, rates, of, finding, bee, colonies, by, 560, and, led, men, to, significantly, higher, yielding, nests, than, those, found, without, honeyguides, contrary, to, most, depictions, of, the, human, honeyguide, relationship, the, hadza, did, not, actively, repay, honeyguides, but, instead, hid, buried, and, burned, honeycomb, with, the, intent, of, keeping, the, bird, hungry, and, thus, more, likely, to, guide, again, some, experts, believe, that, honeyguide, co, evolution, with, humans, goes, back, to, the, stone, tool, making, human, ancestor, homo, erectus, about, 1, 9, million, years, ago, despite, popular, belief, no, evidence, indicates, that, honeyguides, guide, the, honey, badger, though, videos, about, this, exist, there, have, been, accusations, that, they, were, staged, although, most, members, of, the, family, are, not, known, to, recruit, followers, in, their, quest, for, wax, they, are, also, referred, to, as, honeyguides, by, linguistic, extrapolation, the, breeding, behavior, of, eight, species, in, indicator, and, prodotiscus, is, known, they, are, all, brood, parasites, that, lay, one, egg, in, a, nest, of, another, species, laying, eggs, in, series, of, about, five, during, a, period, of, 5, 7, days, most, favor, hole, nesting, species, often, the, related, barbets, and, woodpeckers, but, prodotiscus, parasitizes, cup, nesters, such, as, white, eyes, and, warblers, honeyguide, nestlings, have, been, known, to, physically, eject, their, hosts, chicks, from, the, nests, and, they, have, needle, sharp, hooks, on, their, beaks, with, which, they, puncture, the, hosts, eggs, or, kill, the, nestlings, african, honeyguide, birds, are, known, to, lay, their, eggs, in, underground, nests, of, other, bee, eating, bird, species, the, honeyguide, chicks, kill, the, hatchlings, of, the, host, using, their, needle, sharp, beaks, just, after, hatching, much, as, cuckoo, hatchlings, do, the, honeyguide, mother, ensures, her, chick, hatches, first, by, internally, incubating, the, egg, for, an, extra, day, before, laying, it, so, that, it, has, a, head, start, in, development, compared, to, the, hosts, offspring
