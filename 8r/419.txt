lymantria, dispar, dispar, commonly, known, as, the, gypsy, moth, european, gypsy, moth, ldd, moth, or, in, north, america, north, american, gypsy, moth, or, spongy, moth, is, a, species, of, moth, in, the, family, erebidae, it, has, a, native, range, that, extends, over, europe, and, parts, of, africa, and, is, an, invasive, species, in, north, america, its, larvae, are, polyphagous, consuming, the, leaves, of, over, 500, species, of, trees, shrubs, and, plants, in, its, invasive, range, it, is, classified, as, a, pest, notably, one, of, the, most, destructive, pests, of, hardwood, trees, in, the, eastern, united, states, it, is, listed, as, one, of, the, 100, most, destructive, invasive, species, worldwide, carl, linnaeus, first, described, the, species, as, phalaena, dispar, in, 1758, 2, the, subject, of, classification, has, changed, throughout, the, years, resulting, in, confusion, surrounding, the, species, taxonomy, this, caused, many, references, to, describe, this, one, species, in, different, ways, the, family, has, jumped, between, lymantriidae, noctuidae, and, erebidae, lymantria, dispar, dispar, is, designated, the, nominate, subspecies, of, lymantria, dispar, the, species, l, dispar, has, been, split, into, several, subspecies, including, l, d, subsp, asiatica, and, l, d, subsp, japonica, the, family, is, erebidae, subfamily, lymantriinae, 9, lymantriid, larvae, are, commonly, called, tussock, moths, because, of, the, tufts, of, hair, on, the, larvae, 9, the, name, lymantria, dispar, is, composed, of, two, latin, derived, words, lymantria, means, destroyer, the, word, dispar, is, derived, from, the, latin, for, unequal, and, it, depicts, the, differing, characteristics, between, the, sexes, 9, for, the, purposes, of, taxonomy, the, common, names, european, gypsy, moth, and, north, american, gypsy, moth, represent, the, same, subspecies, lymantria, dispar, dispar, as, opposed, to, subspecies, of, l, dispar, from, asia, 6, confusion, over, the, species, and, subspecies, is, widespread, for, regulatory, purposes, the, u, s, department, of, agriculture, has, defined, asian, gypsy, moth, as, any, biotype, of, lymantria, dispar, sensu, lato, possessing, female, flight, capability, 5, despite, lymantria, dispar, asiatica, not, being, the, only, classified, subspecies, that, is, capable, of, flight, 6, even, females, of, l, d, dispar, can, fly, if, only, very, weakly, traditionally, all, l, dispar, have, been, referred, to, as, gypsy, moth, including, when, referring, to, japanese, indian, and, asiatic, subspecies, 5, in, the, species, native, area, the, english, common, name, is, and, remains, gypsy, moth, in, north, america, in, july, 2021, the, entomological, society, of, america, announced, it, was, delisting, the, common, name, gypsy, moth, as, part, of, an, effort, to, replace, racist, or, otherwise, offensive, names, as, gypsy, is, considered, an, offensive, slur, by, some, in, the, north, american, romani, community, this, led, the, society, to, select, a, replacement, name, through, a, consultative, process, in, january, 2022, they, proposed, the, name, spongy, moth, in, reference, to, the, spongy, mass, of, the, egg, casing, this, new, common, name, was, formally, adopted, in, north, america, in, march, 2022, lymantria, dispar, dispar, is, indigenous, to, europe, in, southeastern, england, it, was, widespread, in, the, 19th, century, but, became, extinct, except, for, occasional, migrants, soon, after, 1900, it, then, recolonised, naturally, from, the, 1990s, colonies, were, found, in, london, from, 1995, and, buckinghamshire, from, 2005, and, more, widely, since, lymantria, dispar, dispar, was, first, brought, to, north, america, in, 1869, 5, 9, and, rapidly, became, an, invasive, species, tienne, l, opold, trouvelot, imported, the, moths, with, the, intent, of, interbreeding, them, with, silk, moths, in, order, to, establish, a, new, silkworm, industry, in, the, west, 10, the, moths, were, accidentally, released, from, his, residence, in, medford, massachusetts, 10, there, are, conflicting, reports, on, the, resulting, actions, one, states, that, despite, issuing, oral, and, written, warnings, of, possible, consequences, no, officials, were, willing, to, assist, in, searching, out, and, destroying, the, moths, 10, the, other, notes, that, trouvelot, was, in, fact, well, aware, of, the, risk, and, there, is, no, direct, evidence, that, he, contacted, any, government, officials, about, the, moths, release, 1, though, the, asiatic, and, the, eurasian, moths, were, not, classified, as, different, subspecies, in, the, 1980s, the, differences, were, already, notable, 9, as, noted, in, the, gypsy, moth, 1896, by, forbush, and, fernald, the, moth, was, considered, a, nuisance, just, ten, years, after, their, release, 10, the, first, major, outbreak, occurred, in, 1889, and, forbush, and, fernald, recount, the, extent, of, devastation, all, the, trees, being, defoliated, and, caterpillars, covering, houses, and, sidewalks, and, raining, down, upon, residents, 1, 10, at, first, it, was, uncertain, what, species, was, responsible, for, the, outbreak, but, after, the, caterpillar, was, identified, by, entomologist, maria, elizabeth, fernald, an, eradication, program, began, in, 1890, 1, eventually, they, would, reach, the, pacific, northwest, sporadically, invading, but, so, far, not, becoming, established, there, due, to, successful, eradication, campaigns, the, small, larvae, of, the, moth, take, to, the, air, and, are, carried, by, the, wind, 10, the, larvae, spin, silken, threads, and, hang, from, them, waiting, for, the, wind, to, blow, 10, the, light, larvae, have, long, hairs, that, increase, their, surface, area, which, are, suitable, for, being, carried, aloft, 10, the, natural, spread, is, slow, but, transportation, of, the, moth, has, led, to, isolated, populations, with, accidental, transport, of, the, eggs, being, noted, 10, according, to, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, without, intervention, this, pest, spreads, about, 13, miles, 21, km, per, year, a, study, published, in, 2012, suggests, that, storms, can, accelerate, the, spread, hypothesizing, that, strong, easterly, winds, carried, larvae, across, lake, michigan, to, wisconsin, a, distance, of, at, least, 50, miles, 80, km, firewood, transport, is, a, common, way, for, the, eggs, to, spread, since, the, moths, will, lay, their, eggs, on, dead, wood, attempts, have, been, made, to, limit, the, movement, of, firewood, to, reduce, the, moth, s, spread, egg, masses, are, typically, laid, on, branches, and, trunks, of, trees, but, may, be, found, in, any, sheltered, location, including, rocks, foliage, and, vehicles, 12, females, are, flightless, so, they, lay, eggs, on, a, surface, near, where, they, emerged, from, their, pupa, 12, the, eggs, are, covered, in, a, coating, of, hairs, 12, the, covering, provides, protection, from, predators, and, parasites, and, may, be, important, for, insulating, the, eggs, from, cold, and, for, sealing, in, moisture, 12, the, larva, inside, the, egg, becomes, fully, developed, in, about, one, month, after, being, laid, and, then, enters, diapause, to, overwinter, 13, the, egg, is, in, the, overwintering, stage, lasting, for, eight, or, nine, months, 13, development, ceases, in, preparation, for, the, winter, 13, after, an, acclimation, stage, during, which, the, larva, inside, the, egg, reduces, its, water, content, eggs, can, withstand, freezing, temperatures, 13, the, larva, inside, the, egg, resumes, activity, in, the, spring, and, reabsorbs, water, 13, the, larva, will, then, chew, through, the, chorion, of, the, egg, and, the, protective, hair, of, the, egg, cluster, in, the, spring, 13, egg, clusters, are, usually, an, oval, about, 19, millimetres, 3, 4, in, wide, and, 38, millimetres, 1, 1, 2, in, long, the, egg, masses, are, buff, yellow, brown, likened, to, a, manila, folder, but, may, bleach, out, over, the, winter, months, as, the, female, lays, them, she, covers, them, with, hair, like, setae, from, her, abdomen, egg, clusters, contain, from, 100, to, 1000, eggs, 12, due, to, the, appearance, of, the, eggs, several, common, names, have, emerged, the, german, schwammspinner, literally, sponge, spinner, and, french, la, spongieuse, refer, to, the, spongy, texture, of, the, egg, cluster, 12, larvae, caterpillars, emerge, from, egg, masses, in, the, spring, 13, most, larvae, hatch, within, a, week, but, can, take, as, long, as, a, month, 13, the, new, larvae, remain, on, or, near, the, egg, cluster, if, they, hatch, in, rainy, weather, or, if, the, temperature, is, below, 7, c, 45, f, 13, the, larvae, will, disperse, even, if, there, is, enough, foliage, for, growth, hanging, from, silk, threads, and, waiting, for, the, wind, to, send, them, aloft, 13, the, larvae, are, about, 3, millimetres, 15, 128, in, long, when, they, first, hatch, and, will, grow, to, 50, or, 90, millimetres, 1, 15, 16, or, 3, 9, 16, in, 14, the, larva, will, first, feed, on, the, leaf, hairs, and, then, move, onto, the, leaf, epidermis, 14, feeding, occurs, in, the, daytime, primarily, in, the, morning, and, late, afternoon, 14, as, the, larva, grow, the, feeding, becomes, a, nocturnal, activity, 14, when, not, eating, the, larva, will, remain, on, the, underside, of, the, leaf, and, make, a, mat, of, silk, for, attachment, 14, to, grow, the, larva, must, molt, 14, larvae, are, characterized, by, the, term, instar, which, refers, to, the, number, of, times, a, larva, has, molted, a, first, instar, larva, has, not, yet, molted, a, second, instar, has, molted, once, a, third, instar, twice, etc, 15, males, typically, are, five, instars, and, females, are, six, instars, 15, when, the, larvae, reach, the, fourth, instar, they, become, nocturnal, feeders, and, will, return, to, their, resting, places, at, dawn, hiding, under, flaps, of, bark, in, crevices, or, under, branches, any, place, that, provides, protection, 15, newly, hatched, larvae, are, black, with, long, hair, like, setae, older, larvae, have, five, pairs, of, raised, blue, spots, and, six, pairs, of, raised, brick, red, spots, along, their, backs, and, a, sprinkling, of, setae, 15, as, the, larval, stage, comes, to, an, end, they, cease, feeding, and, surround, themselves, in, a, silken, net, 15, larvae, can, be, distinguished, from, other, species, of, caterpillar, by, its, spots, close, to, the, head, five, pairs, of, blue, spots, and, six, pairs, of, red, spots, towards, its, tail, this, distinction, will, prevent, confusion, with, the, spiny, elm, caterpillar, and, other, caterpillars, eastern, tent, caterpillars, can, be, distinguished, by, their, silky, tents, in, trees, the, presence, of, a, back, stripe, and, their, preference, for, cherry, trees, the, larvae, reach, maturity, between, mid, june, and, early, july, then, enter, the, pupal, stage, during, which, larvae, change, into, adult, moths, pupation, lasts, from, 14, 17, days, 16, the, adult, moth, will, emerge, fully, developed, by, splitting, the, pupal, skin, 16, when, the, population, is, spread, out, and, running, low, pupation, can, take, place, under, flaps, of, bark, in, crevices, under, branches, on, the, ground, and, in, other, places, where, larvae, rested, during, periods, when, population, numbers, are, dense, pupation, is, not, restricted, to, these, locations, but, can, take, place, in, sheltered, and, open, locations, even, exposed, on, the, trunks, of, trees, or, on, foliage, of, nonhost, trees, usually, the, caterpillars, create, flimsy, cocoons, made, of, silk, strands, holding, the, leaf, together, while, others, do, not, cover, their, pupae, in, cocoons, but, rather, hang, from, a, twig, or, tree, bark, like, butterfly, pupae, do, the, males, have, feathery, antennae, versus, the, thin, antennae, of, females, 11, size, differences, are, also, noted, with, the, forewing, of, the, male, moth, being, 20, 24, millimetres, 101, 128, 121, 128, in, long, and, that, of, the, female, 31, 35, millimetres, 1, 7, 32, 1, 3, 8, in, the, females, are, bigger, than, the, males, another, important, difference, between, the, sexes, is, that, females, possess, fully, formed, wings, but, do, not, fly, 11, 12, female, flight, is, common, in, eurasia, but, these, moths, may, be, of, a, different, species, 11, 12, moths, usually, emerge, from, pupae, in, july, but, it, can, vary, with, population, density, and, climate, 11, the, brown, male, gypsy, moth, emerges, first, usually, one, or, two, days, before, the, females, do, 11, the, males, fly, in, rapid, zigzag, patterns, but, are, capable, of, direct, flight, 11, like, most, moths, the, males, are, typically, nocturnal, but, can, sometimes, be, seen, flying, during, the, day, as, well, the, males, fly, up, and, down, tree, trunks, or, other, vertical, objects, in, search, of, females, 11, when, heavy, black, and, white, egg, laden, females, emerge, they, emit, a, pheromone, that, attracts, the, males, 12, the, female, has, a, small, gland, near, the, tip, of, the, abdomen, that, releases, the, pheromone, with, a, pumping, motion, termed, calling, 12, it, can, attract, males, from, long, distances, tracking, the, scent, through, its, erratic, flight, pattern, 12, the, sex, pheromone, of, female, gypsy, moths, is, 7, r, 8, s, 7, 8, epoxy, 2, methyloctadecane, a, previous, failed, identification, of, this, pheromone, 10, acetoxy, cis, 7, hexadec, 1, ol, was, given, the, trivial, name, of, gyptol, it, was, found, in, female, moth, extracts, but, was, later, shown, to, be, inactive, the, structure, determination, of, this, pheromone, was, an, eventful, chapter, in, the, history, of, pheromone, chemistry, courtship, is, not, elaborate, the, female, must, raise, her, wing, to, allow, the, male, to, couple, with, her, 12, the, moths, remain, in, copula, for, up, to, an, hour, but, the, transfer, of, the, spermatophore, is, usually, accomplished, within, 10, minutes, 12, a, male, moth, can, inseminate, more, than, one, female, 12, multiple, mating, in, females, is, possible, but, uncommon, as, the, female, stops, releasing, the, attracting, pheromone, after, mating, 12, after, mating, the, females, begin, depositing, the, eggs, 12, adult, moths, live, about, one, week, 12, they, do, not, possess, an, active, digestive, system, and, cannot, feed, but, they, can, drink, in, moisture, 12, the, reproductive, chance, for, females, lasts, about, two, days, with, the, pheromone, for, attracting, males, being, diminished, by, the, third, day, 12, due, to, the, pheromone, s, potency, most, females, will, mate, 12, females, lay, their, eggs, on, trees, shrubs, rocks, vehicles, and, plants, of, many, types, each, of, them, typically, lays, about, 500, eggs, the, eggs, are, covered, with, a, peachy, fuzz, that, can, cause, serious, rashes, if, touched, by, bare, skin, or, fur, 12, many, environmental, factors, such, as, resource, availability, predator, density, and, sexual, competition, are, known, to, affect, behavior, from, its, larval, stage, to, adult, stage, a, population, will, exist, for, many, years, in, low, densities, when, the, population, enters, the, release, phase, it, rapidly, expands, to, the, outbreak, phase, where, the, population, size, will, rise, several, orders, of, magnitude, and, fall, back, within, only, a, few, generations, the, gypsy, moth, brings, one, of, the, largest, impacts, in, defoliation, of, deciduous, trees, in, the, northern, hemisphere, since, its, introduction, into, the, united, states, in, 1868, or, 1869, it, has, spread, both, west, and, south, now, taking, over, most, of, the, hardwood, forests, in, the, eastern, united, states, and, canada, over, three, hundred, species, of, trees, and, shrubs, are, hosts, 16, larvae, will, climb, up, any, object, in, their, path, in, search, of, food, 16, larvae, prefer, oak, trees, but, may, feed, on, many, species, of, trees, and, shrubs, both, hardwood, and, conifer, 16, in, the, eastern, us, the, gypsy, moth, prefers, leaves, of, oaks, aspen, apple, sweetgum, speckled, alder, basswood, gray, birch, paper, birch, poplar, willow, and, hawthorns, among, other, species, older, larvae, feed, on, several, species, of, softwood, that, younger, larvae, avoid, including, cottonwood, hemlock, atlantic, white, cypress, and, pine, and, spruce, species, native, to, the, east, the, gypsy, moth, avoids, ash, trees, tulip, tree, american, sycamore, butternut, black, walnut, catalpa, flowering, dogwood, balsam, fir, arborvitae, american, holly, and, mountain, laurel, and, rhododendron, shrubs, but, will, feed, on, these, in, late, instars, when, densities, are, extremely, high, many, species, have, been, identified, as, preying, on, l, dispar, some, species, such, as, the, white, footed, mouse, or, anastaus, disparis, have, a, significant, impact, on, the, population, dynamics, of, the, moth, on, the, other, hand, avian, predation, and, invertebrate, predation, show, only, small, effects, on, population, dynamics, the, white, footed, mouse, peromyscus, leucopus, is, considered, important, for, regulating, sparse, moth, populations, 21, rodents, consume, larvae, and, pupae, that, seek, resting, sites, near, or, on, the, ground, 21, the, white, footed, mouse, is, the, most, common, and, widely, distributed, small, mammal, in, the, northeastern, united, states, 108, the, northern, short, tailed, shrew, is, common, east, of, the, rocky, mountains, and, will, consume, the, larva, and, pupa, 108, insectivorous, birds, prey, upon, the, larva, of, the, gypsy, moth, but, the, egg, clusters, are, protected, by, their, hair, coverings, 21, the, effects, of, bird, predation, have, not, been, fully, studied, in, north, america, 21, but, it, has, been, well, documented, in, japan, and, eurasia, 21, when, outbreaks, of, gypsy, moths, occur, bird, predation, has, no, significant, effect, on, the, population, 105, birds, that, consume, gypsy, moth, larvae, pupae, and, adults, include, the, blue, jay, red, eyed, vireo, eastern, towhee, northern, oriole, catbird, and, the, european, robin, 105, the, black, capped, chickadee, feeds, on, the, moth, throughout, its, entire, life, cycle, including, the, eggs, 105, many, bird, species, feed, on, gypsy, moth, larvae, but, they, are, not, a, major, food, source, for, any, common, bird, species, although, a, few, european, studies, cite, avian, predation, as, a, large, influence, in, keeping, the, gypsy, moth, population, in, control, few, studies, exist, to, prove, this, calosoma, sycophanta, is, a, beetle, that, preys, upon, the, gypsy, moth, larvae, and, pupae, larvae, and, adults, of, the, species, tear, open, their, prey, and, feed, upon, them, 21, in, low, density, populations, there, is, a, positive, correlation, between, larval, mortality, and, predation, rates, on, pupae, gypsy, moth, parasitoids, have, been, widely, studied, but, they, do, not, seem, to, have, major, effects, on, the, population, four, species, of, parasitic, flies, prey, on, gypsy, moth, larva, 20, parasetigana, silvestris, and, exorista, larvarum, lay, an, egg, on, the, gypsy, moth, larva, if, that, egg, hatches, before, the, gypsy, moth, larva, molts, the, fly, larva, will, penetrate, the, host, 20, compsilura, concinnata, pierces, the, gypsy, moth, larva, and, deposits, its, own, larva, inside, 20, blepharipa, pratensis, lays, its, eggs, on, leaves, the, gypsy, moth, larva, will, consume, the, egg, and, the, fly, larva, will, hatch, inside, its, gut, 20, eight, species, of, parasitic, wasps, attack, the, gypsy, moth, ooencyrtus, kuvanae, and, anastatus, disparis, attack, the, eggs, 20, o, kuvanae, attacks, the, eggs, but, the, effectiveness, is, limited, by, the, ovipositor, which, can, only, penetrate, the, surface, layer, of, the, egg, cluster, 20, a, disparis, has, limited, success, as, a, predator, because, it, can, only, attack, unembroyonated, eggs, and, the, female, wasps, do, not, have, wings, 20, even, so, a, disparis, is, the, only, species, that, is, known, to, occasionally, affect, the, population, dynamics, of, the, gypsy, moth, apanteles, melanoscelus, and, phobocampe, disparis, parasitize, the, early, larva, stages, 20, intermedia, and, monodontomerus, aureus, parasitize, the, gypsy, moth, pupae, 20, a, parasite, native, to, north, america, itoplectes, conquisitor, attacks, and, kills, gypsy, moth, pupae, but, development, of, the, larva, is, rare, within, the, host, and, the, number, of, attacks, themselves, is, also, low, 20, glyptapanteles, portheriae, and, g, liparidis, are, both, wasps, that, lay, eggs, on, the, gypsy, moth, larva, study, of, g, liparidis, showed, almost, 90, success, when, the, host, is, parasitized, during, premolt, to, the, third, instar, most, invertebrate, predation, occurred, when, larvae, were, in, the, litter, the, population, in, austria, suffered, high, parasitism, by, the, tachinids, parasetigena, silvestris, which, may, have, contributed, in, prevention, of, further, increase, in, l, dispar, in, this, locality, gypsy, moth, populations, in, different, locations, show, vulnerability, to, different, viral, species, nuclear, polyhedrosis, virus, caused, significant, mortality, in, some, cases, the, most, important, pathogen, is, the, lymantria, dispar, multicapsid, nuclear, polyhedrosis, virus, ldmnpv, sometimes, referred, to, as, npv, or, borralinivirus, reprimens, 21, viral, particles, consumed, by, the, larva, when, eating, through, the, egg, chorion, will, kill, them, during, the, first, instar, 21, the, bodies, disintegrate, spreading, the, virus, on, the, foliage, which, will, then, be, consumed, by, other, larvae, 21, outbreaks, of, the, virus, result, in, high, larva, mortality, 21, and, the, odor, of, the, decaying, larvae, permeates, the, area, 19, the, pathogen, is, used, as, an, insecticide, under, the, name, gypchek, 21, streptococcus, faecalis, is, another, pathogen, that, is, notable, for, its, mortality, 21, larva, killed, by, the, pathogen, have, a, shriveled, appearance, 21, entomophaga, maimaiga, is, a, japanese, fungus, that, helps, control, the, population, of, gypsy, moths, it, was, first, introduced, to, north, america, around, 1910, though, was, not, an, effective, control, until, the, 1980s, population, density, of, larvae, plays, a, major, role, in, their, behavior, at, low, density, larvae, remain, inactive, during, the, day, but, in, high, populations, become, hyperactive, 16, interbreeding, produces, deleterious, genetic, effects, and, dispersal, serves, to, reduce, this, effect, 23, temperature, is, important, to, the, gypsy, moth, low, temperatures, are, fatal, temperatures, of, 9, c, 16, f, can, be, withstood, during, the, winter, an, extended, period, will, kill, the, larvae, inside, and, 23, c, 9, f, even, for, a, short, time, is, lethal, 22, egg, deposits, that, are, low, or, on, the, ground,
