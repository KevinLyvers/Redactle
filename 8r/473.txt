the, northern, pike, esox, lucius, is, a, species, of, carnivorous, fish, of, the, genus, esox, pikes, they, are, commonly, found, in, moderately, salty, and, fresh, waters, of, the, northern, hemisphere, i, e, holarctic, in, distribution, they, are, known, simply, as, a, pike, pl, pike, in, great, britain, ireland, most, of, eastern, europe, canada, and, the, u, s, although, in, the, midwest, they, may, be, called, a, northern, pike, can, grow, to, a, relatively, large, size, their, average, length, is, about, 40, 55, cm, 16, 22, in, with, maximum, recorded, lengths, of, up, to, 150, cm, 59, in, and, maximum, weights, of, 28, 4, kg, 63, lb, the, igfa, currently, recognises, a, 25, kg, 55, lb, pike, caught, by, lothar, louis, on, greffern, lake, germany, on, 16, october, 1986, as, the, all, tackle, world, record, holding, northern, pike, northern, pike, grow, to, larger, sizes, in, eurasia, than, in, north, america, and, in, coastal, eurasian, regions, than, inland, ones, the, northern, pike, gets, its, common, name, from, its, resemblance, to, the, pole, weapon, known, as, the, pike, from, the, middle, english, for, pointed, various, other, unofficial, trivial, names, are, common, pike, lakes, pike, great, northern, pike, great, northern, northern, in, the, u, s, upper, midwest, and, in, the, canadian, provinces, of, alberta, manitoba, and, saskatchewan, jackfish, jack, slough, shark, snake, slimer, slough, snake, gator, due, to, a, head, similar, in, shape, to, that, of, an, alligator, hammer, handle, and, other, such, names, as, long, head, or, pointy, nose, numerous, other, names, can, be, found, in, field, museum, zool, leaflet, number, 9, its, earlier, common, name, the, luci, now, lucy, or, luce, when, fully, grown, was, used, to, form, its, taxonomic, name, esox, lucius, and, is, used, in, heraldry, northern, pike, are, most, often, olive, green, shading, from, yellow, to, white, along, the, belly, the, flank, is, marked, with, short, light, bar, like, spots, and, a, few, to, many, dark, spots, on, the, fins, sometimes, the, fins, are, reddish, younger, pike, have, yellow, stripes, along, a, green, body, later, the, stripes, divide, into, light, spots, and, the, body, turns, from, green, to, olive, green, the, lower, half, of, the, gill, cover, lacks, scales, and, it, has, large, sensory, pores, on, its, head, and, on, the, underside, of, its, lower, jaw, which, are, part, of, the, lateral, line, system, unlike, the, similar, looking, and, closely, related, muskellunge, the, northern, pike, has, light, markings, on, a, dark, body, background, and, fewer, than, six, sensory, pores, on, the, underside, of, each, side, of, the, lower, jaw, a, hybrid, between, northern, pike, and, muskellunge, is, known, as, a, tiger, muskellunge, esox, masquinongy, lucius, or, esox, lucius, masquinongy, depending, on, the, sex, of, each, of, the, contributing, species, in, the, hybrids, the, males, are, invariably, sterile, while, females, are, often, fertile, and, may, back, cross, with, the, parent, species, another, form, of, northern, pike, the, silver, pike, is, not, a, subspecies, but, rather, a, mutation, that, occurs, in, scattered, populations, silver, pike, sometimes, called, silver, muskellunge, lack, the, rows, of, spots, and, appear, silver, white, or, silvery, blue, in, color, when, ill, silver, pike, have, been, known, to, display, a, somewhat, purplish, hue, long, illness, is, also, the, most, common, cause, of, male, sterility, in, italy, the, newly, identified, species, esox, cisalpinus, southern, pike, was, long, thought, to, be, a, color, variation, of, the, northern, pike, but, was, in, 2011, announced, to, be, a, species, of, its, own, northern, pike, in, north, america, seldom, reach, the, size, of, their, european, counterparts, one, of, the, largest, specimens, known, was, a, 21, kg, 46, lb, specimen, from, new, york, it, was, caught, in, great, sacandaga, lake, on, 15, september, 1940, by, peter, dubuc, reports, of, far, larger, pike, have, been, made, but, these, are, either, misidentifications, of, the, pike, s, larger, relative, the, muskellunge, or, simply, have, not, been, properly, documented, and, belong, in, the, realm, of, legend, as, northern, pike, grow, longer, they, increase, in, weight, and, the, relationship, between, length, and, weight, is, not, linear, the, relationship, between, total, length, l, in, inches, and, total, weight, w, in, pounds, for, nearly, all, species, of, fish, can, be, expressed, by, an, equation, of, the, form, invariably, b, is, close, to, 3, 0, for, all, species, and, c, is, a, constant, that, varies, among, species, for, northern, pike, b, 3, 096, and, c, 0, 000180, c, 7, 089, enables, one, to, put, length, in, meters, and, weight, in, kilograms, the, relationship, described, in, this, section, suggests, a, 50, centimetre, 20, in, northern, pike, will, weigh, about, 0, 9, kg, 2, lb, while, a, 65, centimetre, 26, in, northern, pike, will, weigh, about, 1, 8, kg, 4, lb, northern, pike, typically, live, to, 10, 15, years, but, sometimes, up, to, 25, years, pike, are, found, in, sluggish, streams, and, shallow, weedy, places, in, lakes, and, reservoirs, as, well, as, in, cold, clear, rocky, waters, they, are, typical, ambush, predators, they, lie, in, wait, for, prey, holding, perfectly, still, for, long, periods, and, then, exhibit, remarkable, acceleration, as, they, strike, they, inhabit, any, water, body, that, contains, fish, but, suitable, places, for, spawning, are, also, essential, because, of, their, cannibalistic, nature, young, pike, need, places, where, they, can, take, shelter, between, plants, so, they, are, not, eaten, in, both, cases, rich, submerged, vegetation, is, needed, pike, are, seldom, found, in, brackish, water, except, for, the, baltic, sea, area, here, they, can, be, found, spending, time, both, in, the, mouths, of, rivers, and, in, the, open, brackish, waters, of, the, baltic, sea, it, is, normal, for, pike, to, return, to, fresh, water, after, a, period, in, these, brackish, waters, they, seem, to, prefer, water, with, less, turbidity, but, that, is, likely, related, to, their, dependence, on, the, presence, of, vegetation, esox, lucius, is, found, in, fresh, water, throughout, the, northern, hemisphere, including, russia, europe, and, north, america, it, has, also, been, introduced, to, lakes, in, morocco, and, is, even, found, in, brackish, water, of, the, baltic, sea, but, they, are, confined, to, the, low, salinity, water, at, the, surface, of, the, sea, and, are, seldom, seen, in, brackish, water, elsewhere, within, north, america, northern, pike, populations, are, found, in, maine, new, hampshire, vermont, massachusetts, rhode, island, connecticut, new, york, new, jersey, pennsylvania, maryland, west, virginia, ohio, michigan, indiana, illinois, wisconsin, minnesota, iowa, missouri, north, dakota, south, dakota, nebraska, kansas, montana, idaho, utah, colorado, oklahoma, northern, texas, northern, new, mexico, northern, arizona, alaska, the, yukon, the, northwest, territories, alberta, saskatchewan, manitoba, ontario, and, qu, bec, pike, are, rare, in, british, columbia, and, east, coast, provinces, watersheds, in, which, pike, are, found, include, the, ohio, valley, the, upper, mississippi, river, and, its, tributaries, and, the, great, lakes, basin, they, are, also, stocked, in, or, have, been, introduced, to, some, western, lakes, and, reservoirs, for, sport, fishing, although, some, fisheries, managers, believe, this, practice, often, threatens, other, species, of, fish, such, as, bass, trout, and, salmon, causing, government, agencies, to, attempt, to, exterminate, the, pike, by, poisoning, lakes, such, as, stormy, lake, alaska, e, lucius, is, a, severe, invasive, predator, in, box, canyon, reservoir, on, the, pend, oreille, river, in, northeastern, washington, the, northern, pike, is, a, relatively, aggressive, species, especially, with, regard, to, feeding, for, example, when, food, sources, are, scarce, cannibalism, develops, starting, around, five, weeks, in, a, small, percentage, of, populations, this, cannibalism, occurs, when, the, ratio, of, predator, to, prey, is, two, to, one, one, can, expect, this, because, when, food, is, scarce, northern, pike, fight, for, survival, such, as, turning, on, smaller, pike, to, feed, this, is, seen, in, other, species, such, as, tiger, salamanders, usually, pike, tend, to, feed, on, smaller, fish, such, as, the, banded, killifish, however, when, pike, exceed, 700, mm, 28, in, long, they, feed, on, larger, fish, because, of, cannibalism, when, food, is, short, pike, suffer, a, fairly, high, young, mortality, rate, cannibalism, is, more, prevalent, in, cool, summers, as, the, upcoming, pike, have, slow, growth, rates, in, that, season, and, might, not, be, able, to, reach, a, size, to, deter, the, larger, pike, cannibalism, is, likely, to, arise, in, low, growth, and, low, food, conditions, pike, do, not, discriminate, siblings, well, so, cannibalism, between, siblings, is, likely, aggression, also, arises, from, a, need, for, space, young, pike, tend, to, have, their, food, stolen, by, larger, pike, pike, are, aggressive, if, not, given, enough, space, because, they, are, territorial, they, use, a, form, of, foraging, known, as, ambush, foraging, unlike, species, such, as, perch, pike, undergo, bursts, of, energy, instead, of, actively, chasing, down, prey, as, such, a, fair, amount, of, inactive, time, occurs, until, they, find, prey, hunting, efficiency, decreases, with, competition, the, larger, the, pike, the, larger, the, area, controlled, by, that, particular, pike, an, inverse, relation, to, vegetation, density, and, pike, size, exists, which, is, due, to, the, possibility, of, cannibalism, from, the, largest, pike, this, makes, sense, as, the, smaller, pike, need, more, vegetation, to, avoid, being, eaten, large, pike, do, not, have, this, worry, and, can, afford, the, advantage, of, a, large, line, of, sight, they, prefer, a, tree, structure, habitat, there, has, been, at, least, one, instance, of, a, pike, attacking, a, dog, pike, are, occasionally, preyed, upon, by, otters, pike, are, capable, of, fast, start, movements, which, are, sudden, high, energy, bursts, of, unsteady, swimming, many, other, fish, exhibit, this, movement, as, well, most, fish, use, this, mechanism, to, avoid, life, threatening, situations, for, the, pike, however, it, is, a, tool, used, to, capture, prey, from, their, sedentary, positions, they, flash, out, in, such, bursts, and, capture, their, prey, these, fast, starts, terminate, when, the, pike, has, reached, maximum, velocity, during, such, motions, pike, make, s, conformations, while, swimming, at, high, rates, to, decelerate, they, simply, make, a, c, conformation, exponentially, slowing, down, their, speed, so, that, they, can, stop, an, interesting, behavioural, trait, that, pike, have, is, that, they, have, short, digestion, times, and, long, feeding, periods, they, can, undergo, many, of, these, fast, bursts, to, collect, as, much, prey, as, they, can, pike, are, least, active, during, the, night, pike, have, a, strong, homing, behaviour, they, inhabit, certain, areas, by, nature, during, the, summer, they, tend, to, group, closer, to, vegetation, than, during, the, winter, the, exact, reason, is, not, clear, but, likely, is, a, result, of, foraging, or, possibly, reproductive, needs, to, safeguard, young, pike, diel, rhythm, changes, significantly, over, the, year, on, sunny, days, pike, stay, closer, to, the, shallow, shore, on, windy, days, they, are, further, from, shore, when, close, to, the, shore, pike, have, a, preference, for, shallow, vegetated, areas, pike, are, more, stationary, in, reservoirs, than, lakes, a, possibility, is, that, lakes, have, more, prey, to, feed, upon, or, possibly, in, reservoirs, prey, will, ultimately, cross, paths, with, the, pike, as, such, this, could, be, a, form, of, energy, conservation, pike, breed, in, the, spring, pike, are, physically, capable, of, breeding, at, an, age, of, about, two, years, spawning, in, spring, when, the, water, temperature, first, reaches, about, 9, c, 48, f, they, have, a, tendency, to, lay, a, large, number, of, eggs, a, likely, explanation, for, such, actions, is, to, produce, as, many, surviving, offspring, as, possible, as, many, most, likely, die, early, in, life, in, females, the, gonads, enlarge, when, it, is, time, to, shed, her, eggs, however, after, they, are, shed, these, eggs, will, not, hatch, if, the, water, is, below, 6, c, 43, f, male, pike, arrive, at, the, breeding, grounds, before, females, do, preceding, them, by, a, few, weeks, in, addition, the, males, stay, after, the, spawning, is, finished, parental, stock, is, vital, for, pike, success, egg, survival, has, been, shown, to, be, positively, correlated, with, number, of, eggs, laid, for, breeding, the, more, stable, the, water, the, greater, the, fitness, of, the, pike, mortality, results, from, toxic, concentrations, of, iron, or, rapid, temperature, changes, and, adult, abundance, and, the, strength, of, the, resulting, year, classes, are, not, related, it, is, based, upon, two, points, of, development, one, during, embryo, stage, between, fertilization, and, closure, of, the, blastopore, and, the, second, between, hatching, and, the, termination, of, the, alevin, stage, the, colour, of, the, sticky, eggs, is, yellow, to, orange, the, diameter, is, 2, 5, to, 3, mm, 0, 098, to, 0, 118, in, the, embryos, are, 7, 5, to, 10, mm, 0, 30, to, 0, 39, in, in, length, and, able, to, swim, after, hatching, but, stay, on, the, bottom, for, some, time, the, embryonic, stage, is, five, to, 16, days, dependent, on, water, temperature, at, 19, c, 66, f, and, 10, c, 50, f, respectively, under, natural, circumstances, the, survival, from, free, swimming, larva, to, 75, mm, pike, is, around, 5, the, young, free, swimming, pike, feed, on, small, invertebrates, starting, with, daphnia, and, quickly, move, on, to, bigger, prey, such, as, asellus, and, gammarus, when, the, body, length, is, 4, to, 8, cm, 1, 6, to, 3, 1, in, they, start, feeding, on, small, fish, a, pike, has, a, very, typical, hunting, behaviour, it, is, able, to, remain, stationary, in, the, water, by, moving, the, last, fin, rays, of, the, dorsal, fins, and, the, pectoral, fins, before, striking, it, bends, its, body, and, darts, out, to, the, prey, using, the, large, surface, of, its, caudal, fin, dorsal, fin, and, anal, fin, to, propel, itself, the, fish, has, a, distinctive, habit, of, catching, its, prey, sideways, in, the, mouth, immobilising, it, with, its, sharp, backward, pointing, teeth, and, then, turning, the, prey, headfirst, to, swallow, it, for, larger, prey, the, pike, will, usually, attempt, to, drown, the, prey, before, carrying, it, off, to, be, consumed, it, eats, mainly, fish, and, frogs, but, also, small, mammals, and, birds, fall, prey, to, pike, young, pike, have, been, found, dead, from, choking, on, a, pike, of, a, similar, size, an, observation, referred, to, by, the, renowned, english, poet, ted, hughes, in, his, famous, poem, pike, northern, pike, also, feed, on, insects, crayfish, and, leeches, they, are, not, very, particular, and, eat, spiny, fish, like, perch, and, will, even, take, fish, as, small, as, sticklebacks, if, they, are, the, only, available, prey, pike, are, known, to, occasionally, hunt, and, consume, larger, water, birds, such, as, an, incident, in, 2016, when, an, individual, was, observed, trying, to, drown, and, eat, a, great, crested, grebe, an, incident, in, which, a, pike, choked, to, death, after, killing, and, attempting, to, eat, a, tufted, duck, as, well, as, an, incident, in, 2015, where, an, attack, by, a, large, pike, between, three, and, four, feet, long, was, implicated, as, a, possible, cause, for, the, injury, and, death, of, an, adult, mute, swan, on, lower, lough, erne, northern, ireland, but, it, is, generally, believed, that, such, attacks, are, only, rare, occurrences, the, northern, pike, is, a, largely, solitary, predator, it, migrates, during, a, spawning, season, and, it, follows, prey, fish, like, common, roaches, to, their, deeper, winter, quarters, sometimes, divers, observe, groups, of, similar, sized, pike, that, cooperate, some, to, start, hunting, at, the, same, time, so, wolfpack, theories, are, given, large, pike, can, be, caught, on, dead, immobile, fish, so, these, pike, are, thought, to, move, about, in, a, rather, large, territory, to, find, food, large, pike, are, also, known, to, cruise, large, water, bodies, at, a, few, metres, deep, probably, pursuing, schools, of, prey, fish, smaller, pike, are, more, of, ambush, predators, probably, because, of, their, vulnerability, to, cannibalism, pike, are, often, found, near, the, exit, of, culverts, which, can, be, attributed, to, the, presence, of, schools, of, prey, fish, and, the, opportunity, for, ambush, being, potamodromous, all, esocids, tend, to, display, limited, migration, although, some, local, movement, may, be, of, key, significance, for, population, dynamics, in, the, baltic, they, are, known, to, follow, herring, schools, so, have, some, seasonal, migration, although, it, is, generally, known, as, a, sporting, quarry, some, anglers, release, pike, they, have, caught, because, the, flesh, is, considered, bony, especially, due, to, the, substantial, epipleural, y, bones, the, white, and, mild, tasting, flesh, of, pikes, nonetheless, has, a, long, and, distinguished, history, in, cuisine, and, is, popular, fare, in, europe, and, parts, of, north, america, among, fishing, communities, where, pike, is, popular, fare, the, ability, of, a, filleter, to, effectively, remove, the, bones, from, the, fillets, while, minimizing, the, amount, of, flesh, lost, in, the, process, known, as, de, boning, is, a, highly, valued, skill, there, are, methods, for, filleting, pike, and, leaving, the, y, bones, in, the, fish, s, body, this, does, leave, some, flesh, on, the, fish, but, avoids, the, sometimes, difficult, process, of, de, boning, larger, fish, are, more, easily, filleted, and, much, easier, to, de, bone, while, smaller, ones, are, often, processed, as, forcemeat, to, eliminate, their, many, small, bones, and, then, used, in, preparations, such, as, quenelles, and, fish, mousses, historical, references, to, cooking, pike, go, as, far, back, as, the, romans, fishing, for, pike, is, said, to, be, very, exciting, with, their, aggressive, hits, and, aerial, acrobatics, pike, are, among, the, largest, north, american, freshwater, game, fish, because, of, their, prolific, and, predatory, nature, laws, have, been, enacted, in, some, places, to, help, stop, the, spread, of, northern, pike, outside, of, their, native, range, for, instance, in, california, anglers, are, required, by, law, to, remove, the, head, from, a, pike, once, it, has, been, caught, in, alaska, pike, are, native, north, and, west, of, the, alaska, range, but, have, been, illegally, introduced, to, south, central, alaska, by, game, fishermen, in, south, central, alaska, no, limit, is, imposed, in, most, areas, pike, are, seen, as, a, threat, to, native, wild, stocks, of, salmon, by, some, fishery, managers, notably, in, britain, and, ireland, pike, are, greatly, admired, as, a, sporting, fish, and, they, are, returned, alive, to, the, water, to, safeguard, future, sport, and, maintain, the, balance, of, a, fishery, the, pike, anglers, club, has, campaigned, to, preserve, pike, since, 1977, arguing, that, the, removal, of, pike, from, waters, can, lead, to, an, explosion, of, smaller, fish, and, to, ensure, pike, removal, stops, which, is, damaging, to, both, the, sport, fishery, and, the, environment, pike, angling, is, becoming, an, increasingly, popular, pastime, in, europe, effective, methods, for, catching, include, dead, baits, lure, fishing, and, jerk, baiting, they, are, prized, as, game, fish, for, their, large, size, and, aggressive, nature, lake, fishing, for, pike, from, the, shore, is, especially, effective, during, spring, when, the, big, pike, move, into, the, shallows, to, spawn, in, weedy, areas, and, later, many, remain, there, to, feed, on, other, spawning, coarse, fish, species, to, regain, their, condition, after, spawning, smaller, jack, pike, often, remain, in, the, shallows, for, their, own, protection, and, for, the, small, fish, food, available, there, for, the, hot, summer, and, during, inactive, phases, the, larger, female, pike, tend, to, retire, to, deeper, water, and, or, places, with, better, cover, this, gives, the, boat, angler, good, fishing, during, the, summer, and, winter, seasons, trolling, towing, a, fairy, or, bait, behind, a, moving, boat, is, a, popular, technique, the, use, of, float, tubes, is, another, method, of, fishing, for, pike, on, small, to, medium, sized, still, waters, fly, fishing, for, pike, is, another, eligible, way, of, catching, these, fish, and, the, float, tube, is, now, recognized, as, an, especially, suitable, water, craft, for, pike, fly, fishing, also, they, have, been, caught, this, way, by, using, patterns, that, imitate, small, fry, or, invertebrates, in, recent, decades, more, pike, are, released, back, to, the, water, after, catching, catch, and, release, but, they, can, easily, be, damaged, when, handled, handling, those, fish, with, dry, hands, can, easily, damage, their, mucus, covered, skin, and, possibly, lead, to, their, deaths, from, infections, since, they, have, very, sharp, and, numerous, teeth, care, is, required, in, unhooking, a, pike, barbless, trebles, are, recommended, when, angling, for, this, species, as, they, simplify, unhooking, this, is, undertaken, using, long, forceps, with, 30, cm, artery, clamps, the, ideal, tool, when, holding, the, pike, from, below, on, the, lower, jaw, it, will, open, its, mouth, it, should, be, kept, out, of, the, water, for, the, minimum, amount, of, time, possible, and, should, be, given, extra, time, to, recover, if, being, weighed, and, photographed, before, release, it, s, also, recommended, that, anglers, use, an, unhooking, mat, to, prevent, it, from, harm, if, practicing, live, release, calling, the, fish, caught, when, it, is, alongside, a, boat, is, recommended, remove, the, hook, by, grabbing, it, with, needle, nosed, pliers, while, the, fish, is, still, submerged, and, giving, it, a, flip, in, the, direction, that, turns, the, hook, out, of, the, mouth, this, avoids, damage, to, the, fish, and, the, stress, of, being, out, of, water, in, finland, catching, a, kymppihauki, a, pike, weighing, at, least, 10, kg, 22, lb, is, considered, the, qualification, as, a, master, fisherman, many, countries, have, banned, the, use, of, live, fish, for, bait, but, pike, can, be, caught, with, dead, fish, which, they, locate, by, smell, for, this, technique, fat, marine, fish, like, herring, sardines, and, mackerel, are, often, used, compared, to, other, fish, like, the, eel, the, pike, does, not, have, a, good, sense, of, smell, but, it, is, still, more, than, adequate, to, find, the, baitfish, baitfish, can, be, used, as, groundbait, but, also, below, a, float, carried, by, the, wind, this, method, is, often, used, in, wintertime, and, best, done, in, lakes, near, schools, of, preyfish, or, at, the, deeper, parts, of, shallow, water, bodies, where, pike, and, preyfish, tend, to, gather, in, great, numbers, pike, make, use, of, the, lateral, line, system, to, follow, the, vortices, produced, by, the, perceived, prey, and, the, whirling, movement, of, the, spinner, is, probably, a, good, way, to, imitate, or, exaggerate, these, jerkbaits, are, also, effective, and, can, produce, spectacular, bites, with, pike, attacking, these, erratic, moving, lures, at, full, speed, for, trolling, big, plugs, or, softbaits, can, be, used, spoons, with, mirror, finishes, are, very, effective, when, the, sun, is, at, a, sharp, angle, to, the, water, in, the, mornings, or, evenings, because, they, generate, the, vibrations, previously, discussed, and, cause, a, glint, of, reflective, sunlight, that, mimics, the, flash, of, white, bellied, prey, when, fishing, in, shallow, water, for, smaller, pike, lighter, and, smaller, lures, are, frequently, used, the, humble, woolly, bugger, fly, is, a, favourite, lure, among, keen, fly, fisherman, of, the, southern, hemisphere, fly, fishing, for, pike, is, an, established, aspect, of, the, sport, and, there, are, now, numerous, dedicated, products, to, use, specifically, to, target, these, fish, in, the, finnish, epic, poetry, kalevala, wise, demigod, v, in, m, inen, creates, a,
