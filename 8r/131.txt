the, skull, is, a, bone, protective, cavity, for, the, brain, the, skull, is, composed, of, three, types, of, bone, cranial, bones, facial, bones, and, ear, ossicles, two, parts, are, more, prominent, the, cranium, pl, craniums, or, crania, and, the, mandible, in, humans, these, two, parts, are, the, neurocranium, braincase, and, the, viscerocranium, facial, skeleton, that, includes, the, mandible, as, its, largest, bone, the, skull, forms, the, anterior, most, portion, of, the, skeleton, and, is, a, product, of, cephalisation, housing, the, brain, and, several, sensory, structures, such, as, the, eyes, ears, nose, and, mouth, in, humans, these, sensory, structures, are, part, of, the, facial, skeleton, functions, of, the, skull, include, protection, of, the, brain, fixing, the, distance, between, the, eyes, to, allow, stereoscopic, vision, and, fixing, the, position, of, the, ears, to, enable, sound, localisation, of, the, direction, and, distance, of, sounds, in, some, animals, such, as, horned, ungulates, mammals, with, hooves, the, skull, also, has, a, defensive, function, by, providing, the, mount, on, the, frontal, bone, for, the, horns, the, english, word, skull, is, probably, derived, from, old, norse, skulle, while, the, latin, word, cranium, comes, from, the, greek, root, kranion, the, human, skull, fully, develops, two, years, after, birth, the, junctions, of, the, skull, bones, are, joined, by, structures, called, sutures, the, skull, is, made, up, of, a, number, of, fused, flat, bones, and, contains, many, foramina, fossae, processes, and, several, cavities, or, sinuses, in, zoology, there, are, openings, in, the, skull, called, fenestrae, the, human, skull, is, the, bone, structure, that, forms, the, head, in, the, human, skeleton, it, supports, the, structures, of, the, face, and, forms, a, cavity, for, the, brain, like, the, skulls, of, other, vertebrates, it, protects, the, brain, from, injury, the, skull, consists, of, three, parts, of, different, embryological, origin, the, neurocranium, the, sutures, and, the, facial, skeleton, the, neurocranium, or, braincase, forms, the, protective, cranial, cavity, that, surrounds, and, houses, the, brain, and, brainstem, the, upper, areas, of, the, cranial, bones, form, the, calvaria, skullcap, the, membranous, viscerocranium, includes, the, mandible, the, sutures, are, fairly, rigid, joints, between, bones, of, the, neurocranium, the, facial, skeleton, is, formed, by, the, bones, supporting, the, face, except, for, the, mandible, all, of, the, bones, of, the, skull, are, joined, by, sutures, synarthrodial, immovable, joints, formed, by, bony, ossification, with, sharpey, s, fibres, permitting, some, flexibility, sometimes, there, can, be, extra, bone, pieces, within, the, suture, known, as, wormian, bones, or, sutural, bones, most, commonly, these, are, found, in, the, course, of, the, lambdoid, suture, the, human, skull, is, generally, considered, to, consist, of, 22, bones, eight, cranial, bones, and, fourteen, facial, skeleton, bones, in, the, neurocranium, these, are, the, occipital, bone, two, temporal, bones, two, parietal, bones, the, sphenoid, ethmoid, and, frontal, bones, the, bones, of, the, facial, skeleton, 14, are, the, vomer, two, inferior, nasal, conchae, two, nasal, bones, two, maxilla, the, mandible, two, palatine, bones, two, zygomatic, bones, and, two, lacrimal, bones, some, sources, count, a, paired, bone, as, one, or, the, maxilla, as, having, two, bones, as, its, parts, some, sources, include, the, hyoid, bone, or, the, three, ossicles, of, the, middle, ear, the, malleus, incus, and, stapes, but, the, overall, general, consensus, of, the, number, of, bones, in, the, human, skull, is, the, stated, twenty, two, some, of, these, bones, the, occipital, parietal, frontal, in, the, neurocranium, and, the, nasal, lacrimal, and, vomer, in, the, facial, skeleton, are, flat, bones, the, skull, also, contains, sinuses, air, filled, cavities, known, as, paranasal, sinuses, and, numerous, foramina, the, sinuses, are, lined, with, respiratory, epithelium, their, known, functions, are, the, lessening, of, the, weight, of, the, skull, the, aiding, of, resonance, to, the, voice, and, the, warming, and, moistening, of, the, air, drawn, into, the, nasal, cavity, the, foramina, are, openings, in, the, skull, the, largest, of, these, is, the, foramen, magnum, of, the, occipital, bone, that, allows, the, passage, of, the, spinal, cord, as, well, as, nerves, and, blood, vessels, the, many, processes, of, the, skull, include, the, mastoid, process, and, the, zygomatic, processes, the, fenestrae, from, latin, meaning, windows, are, openings, in, the, skull, the, jugal, is, a, skull, bone, that, found, in, most, of, the, reptiles, amphibians, and, birds, in, mammals, the, jugal, is, often, called, the, zygomatic, bone, or, malar, bone, the, prefrontal, bone, is, a, bone, that, separates, the, lacrimal, and, frontal, bones, in, many, tetrapod, skulls, the, skull, of, fish, is, formed, from, a, series, of, only, loosely, connected, bones, lampreys, and, sharks, only, poss, a, cartilaginous, endocranium, with, both, the, upper, jaw, and, the, lower, jaws, being, separate, elements, bony, fishes, have, additional, dermal, bone, forming, a, more, or, less, coherent, skull, roof, in, lungfish, and, holost, fish, the, lower, jaw, defines, the, chin, the, simpler, structure, is, found, in, jawless, fish, in, which, the, cranium, is, normally, represented, by, a, trough, like, basket, of, cartilaginous, elements, only, partially, enclosing, the, brain, and, associated, with, the, capsules, for, the, inner, ears, and, the, single, nostril, distinctively, these, fish, have, no, jaws, cartilaginous, fish, such, as, sharks, and, rays, have, also, simple, and, presumably, primitive, skull, structures, the, cranium, is, a, single, structure, forming, a, case, around, the, brain, enclosing, the, lower, surface, and, the, sides, but, always, at, least, partially, open, at, the, top, as, a, large, fontanelle, the, most, anterior, part, of, the, cranium, includes, a, forward, plate, of, cartilage, the, rostrum, and, capsules, to, enclose, the, olfactory, organs, behind, these, are, the, orbits, and, then, an, additional, pair, of, capsules, enclosing, the, structure, of, the, inner, ear, finally, the, skull, tapers, towards, the, rear, where, the, foramen, magnum, lies, immediately, above, a, single, condyle, articulating, with, the, first, vertebra, there, are, in, addition, at, various, points, throughout, the, cranium, smaller, foramina, for, the, cranial, nerves, the, jaws, consist, of, separate, hoops, of, cartilage, almost, always, distinct, from, the, cranium, proper, in, ray, finned, fish, there, has, also, been, considerable, modification, from, the, primitive, pattern, the, roof, of, the, skull, is, generally, well, formed, and, although, the, exact, relationship, of, its, bones, to, those, of, tetrapods, is, unclear, they, are, usually, given, similar, names, for, convenience, other, elements, of, the, skull, however, may, be, reduced, there, is, little, cheek, region, behind, the, enlarged, orbits, and, little, if, any, bone, in, between, them, the, upper, jaw, is, often, formed, largely, from, the, premaxilla, with, the, maxilla, itself, located, further, back, and, an, additional, bone, the, symplectic, linking, the, jaw, to, the, rest, of, the, cranium, although, the, skulls, of, fossil, lobe, finned, fish, resemble, those, of, the, early, tetrapods, the, same, cannot, be, said, of, those, of, the, living, lungfishes, the, skull, roof, is, not, fully, formed, and, consists, of, multiple, somewhat, irregularly, shaped, bones, with, no, direct, relationship, to, those, of, tetrapods, the, upper, jaw, is, formed, from, the, pterygoids, and, vomers, alone, all, of, which, bear, teeth, much, of, the, skull, is, formed, from, cartilage, and, its, overall, structure, is, reduced, the, skulls, of, the, earliest, tetrapods, closely, resembled, those, of, their, ancestors, amongst, the, lobe, finned, fishes, the, skull, roof, is, formed, of, a, series, of, plate, like, bones, including, the, maxilla, frontals, parietals, and, lacrimals, among, others, it, is, overlaying, the, endocranium, corresponding, to, the, cartilaginous, skull, in, sharks, and, rays, the, various, separate, bones, that, compose, the, temporal, bone, of, humans, are, also, part, of, the, skull, roof, series, a, further, plate, composed, of, four, pairs, of, bones, forms, the, roof, of, the, mouth, these, include, the, vomer, and, palatine, bones, the, base, of, the, cranium, is, formed, from, a, ring, of, bones, surrounding, the, foramen, magnum, and, a, median, bone, lying, further, forward, these, are, homologous, with, the, occipital, bone, and, parts, of, the, sphenoid, in, mammals, finally, the, lower, jaw, is, composed, of, multiple, bones, only, the, most, anterior, of, which, the, dentary, is, homologous, with, the, mammalian, mandible, in, living, tetrapods, a, great, many, of, the, original, bones, have, either, disappeared, or, fused, into, one, another, in, various, arrangements, birds, have, a, diapsid, skull, as, in, reptiles, with, a, prelacrimal, fossa, present, in, some, reptiles, the, skull, has, a, single, occipital, condyle, the, skull, consists, of, five, major, bones, the, frontal, top, of, head, parietal, back, of, head, premaxillary, and, nasal, top, beak, and, the, mandible, bottom, beak, the, skull, of, a, normal, bird, usually, weighs, about, 1, of, the, bird, s, total, bodyweight, the, eye, occupies, a, considerable, amount, of, the, skull, and, is, surrounded, by, a, sclerotic, eye, ring, a, ring, of, tiny, bones, this, characteristic, is, also, seen, in, reptiles, living, amphibians, typically, have, greatly, reduced, skulls, with, many, of, the, bones, either, absent, or, wholly, or, partly, replaced, by, cartilage, in, mammals, and, birds, in, particular, modifications, of, the, skull, occurred, to, allow, for, the, expansion, of, the, brain, the, fusion, between, the, various, bones, is, especially, notable, in, birds, in, which, the, individual, structures, may, be, difficult, to, identify, the, skull, is, a, complex, structure, its, bones, are, formed, both, by, intramembranous, and, endochondral, ossification, the, skull, roof, bones, comprising, the, bones, of, the, facial, skeleton, and, the, sides, and, roof, of, the, neurocranium, are, dermal, bones, formed, by, intramembranous, ossification, though, the, temporal, bones, are, formed, by, endochondral, ossification, the, endocranium, the, bones, supporting, the, brain, the, occipital, sphenoid, and, ethmoid, are, largely, formed, by, endochondral, ossification, thus, frontal, and, parietal, bones, are, purely, membranous, the, geometry, of, the, skull, base, and, its, fossae, the, anterior, middle, and, posterior, cranial, fossae, changes, rapidly, the, anterior, cranial, fossa, changes, especially, during, the, first, trimester, of, pregnancy, and, skull, defects, can, often, develop, during, this, time, at, birth, the, human, skull, is, made, up, of, 44, separate, bony, elements, during, development, many, of, these, bony, elements, gradually, fuse, together, into, solid, bone, for, example, the, frontal, bone, the, bones, of, the, roof, of, the, skull, are, initially, separated, by, regions, of, dense, connective, tissue, called, fontanelles, there, are, six, fontanelles, one, anterior, or, frontal, one, posterior, or, occipital, two, sphenoid, or, anterolateral, and, two, mastoid, or, posterolateral, at, birth, these, regions, are, fibrous, and, moveable, necessary, for, birth, and, later, growth, this, growth, can, put, a, large, amount, of, tension, on, the, obstetrical, hinge, which, is, where, the, squamous, and, lateral, parts, of, the, occipital, bone, meet, a, possible, complication, of, this, tension, is, rupture, of, the, great, cerebral, vein, as, growth, and, ossification, progress, the, connective, tissue, of, the, fontanelles, is, invaded, and, replaced, by, bone, creating, sutures, the, five, sutures, are, the, two, squamous, sutures, one, coronal, one, lambdoid, and, one, sagittal, suture, the, posterior, fontanelle, usually, closes, by, eight, weeks, but, the, anterior, fontanel, can, remain, open, up, to, eighteen, months, the, anterior, fontanelle, is, located, at, the, junction, of, the, frontal, and, parietal, bones, it, is, a, soft, spot, on, a, baby, s, forehead, careful, observation, will, show, that, you, can, count, a, baby, s, heart, rate, by, observing, the, pulse, pulsing, softly, through, the, anterior, fontanelle, the, skull, in, the, neonate, is, large, in, proportion, to, other, parts, of, the, body, the, facial, skeleton, is, one, seventh, of, the, size, of, the, calvaria, in, the, adult, it, is, half, the, size, the, base, of, the, skull, is, short, and, narrow, though, the, inner, ear, is, almost, adult, size, craniosynostosis, is, a, condition, in, which, one, or, more, of, the, fibrous, sutures, in, an, infant, skull, prematurely, fuses, and, changes, the, growth, pattern, of, the, skull, because, the, skull, cannot, expand, perpendicular, to, the, fused, suture, it, grows, more, in, the, parallel, direction, sometimes, the, resulting, growth, pattern, provides, the, necessary, space, for, the, growing, brain, but, results, in, an, abnormal, head, shape, and, abnormal, facial, features, in, cases, in, which, the, compensation, does, not, effectively, provide, enough, space, for, the, growing, brain, craniosynostosis, results, in, increased, intracranial, pressure, leading, possibly, to, visual, impairment, sleeping, impairment, eating, difficulties, or, an, impairment, of, mental, development, a, copper, beaten, skull, is, a, phenomenon, wherein, intense, intracranial, pressure, disfigures, the, internal, surface, of, the, skull, the, name, comes, from, the, fact, that, the, inner, skull, has, the, appearance, of, having, been, beaten, with, a, ball, peen, hammer, such, as, is, often, used, by, coppersmiths, the, condition, is, most, common, in, children, injuries, to, the, brain, can, be, life, threatening, normally, the, skull, protects, the, brain, from, damage, through, its, high, resistance, to, deformation, the, skull, is, one, of, the, least, deformable, structures, found, in, nature, needing, the, force, of, about, 1, ton, to, reduce, its, diameter, by, 1, cm, in, some, cases, of, head, injury, however, there, can, be, raised, intracranial, pressure, through, mechanisms, such, as, a, subdural, haematoma, in, these, cases, the, raised, intracranial, pressure, can, cause, herniation, of, the, brain, out, of, the, foramen, magnum, coning, because, there, is, no, space, for, the, brain, to, expand, this, can, result, in, significant, brain, damage, or, death, unless, an, urgent, operation, is, performed, to, relieve, the, pressure, this, is, why, patients, with, concussion, must, be, watched, extremely, carefully, repeated, concussions, can, activate, the, structure, of, skull, bones, as, the, brain, s, protective, covering, dating, back, to, neolithic, times, a, skull, operation, called, trepanning, was, sometimes, performed, this, involved, drilling, a, burr, hole, in, the, cranium, examination, of, skulls, from, this, period, reveals, that, the, patients, sometimes, survived, for, many, years, afterward, it, seems, likely, that, trepanning, was, also, performed, purely, for, ritualistic, or, religious, reasons, nowadays, this, procedure, is, still, used, but, is, normally, called, a, craniectomy, in, march, 2013, for, the, first, time, in, the, u, s, researchers, replaced, a, large, percentage, of, a, patient, s, skull, with, a, precision, 3d, printed, polymer, implant, about, 9, months, later, the, first, complete, cranium, replacement, with, a, 3d, printed, plastic, insert, was, performed, on, a, dutch, woman, she, had, been, suffering, from, hyperostosis, which, increased, the, thickness, of, her, skull, and, compressed, her, brain, a, study, conducted, in, 2018, by, the, researchers, of, harvard, medical, school, in, boston, funded, by, national, institutes, of, health, nih, suggested, that, instead, of, travelling, via, blood, there, are, tiny, channels, in, the, skull, through, which, the, immune, cells, combined, with, the, bone, marrow, reach, the, areas, of, inflammation, after, an, injury, to, the, brain, tissues, surgical, alteration, of, sexually, dimorphic, skull, features, may, be, carried, out, as, a, part, of, facial, feminization, surgery, or, facial, masculinization, surgery, these, reconstructive, surgical, procedures, that, can, alter, sexually, dimorphic, facial, features, to, bring, them, closer, in, shape, and, size, to, facial, features, of, the, desired, sex, these, procedures, can, be, an, important, part, of, the, treatment, of, transgender, people, for, gender, dysphoria, artificial, cranial, deformation, is, a, largely, historical, practice, of, some, cultures, cords, and, wooden, boards, would, be, used, to, apply, pressure, to, an, infant, s, skull, and, alter, its, shape, sometimes, quite, significantly, this, procedure, would, begin, just, after, birth, and, would, be, carried, on, for, several, years, like, the, face, the, skull, and, teeth, can, also, indicate, a, person, s, life, history, and, origin, forensic, scientists, and, archaeologists, use, quantitative, and, qualitative, traits, to, estimate, what, the, bearer, of, the, skull, looked, like, when, a, significant, amount, of, bones, are, found, such, as, at, spitalfields, in, the, uk, and, j, mon, shell, mounds, in, japan, osteologists, can, use, traits, such, as, the, proportions, of, length, height, and, width, to, know, the, relationships, of, the, population, of, the, study, with, other, living, or, extinct, populations, the, german, physician, franz, joseph, gall, in, around, 1800, formulated, the, theory, of, phrenology, which, attempted, to, show, that, specific, features, of, the, skull, are, associated, with, certain, personality, traits, or, intellectual, capabilities, of, its, owner, his, theory, is, now, considered, to, be, pseudoscientific, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, anthropologists, found, it, crucial, to, distinguish, between, male, and, female, skulls, an, anthropologist, of, the, time, james, mcgrigor, allan, argued, that, the, female, brain, was, similar, to, that, of, an, animal, this, allowed, anthropologists, to, declare, that, women, were, in, fact, more, emotional, and, less, rational, than, men, mcgrigor, then, concluded, that, women, s, brains, were, more, analogous, to, infants, thus, deeming, them, inferior, at, the, time, to, further, these, claims, of, female, inferiority, and, silence, the, feminists, of, the, time, other, anthropologists, joined, in, on, the, studies, of, the, female, skull, these, cranial, measurements, are, the, basis, of, what, is, known, as, craniology, these, cranial, measurements, were, also, used, to, draw, a, connection, between, women, and, black, people, research, has, shown, that, while, in, early, life, there, is, little, difference, between, male, and, female, skulls, in, adulthood, male, skulls, tend, to, be, larger, and, more, robust, than, female, skulls, which, are, lighter, and, smaller, with, a, cranial, capacity, about, 10, percent, less, than, that, of, the, male, however, later, studies, show, that, women, s, skulls, are, slightly, thicker, and, thus, men, may, be, more, susceptible, to, head, injury, than, women, however, other, studies, shows, that, men, s, skulls, are, slightly, thicker, in, certain, areas, some, studies, show, that, females, are, more, susceptible, to, concussion, than, males, men, s, skulls, have, also, been, shown, to, maintain, density, with, age, which, may, aid, in, preventing, head, injury, while, women, s, skull, density, slightly, decreases, with, age, male, skulls, can, all, have, more, prominent, supraorbital, ridges, glabella, and, temporal, lines, female, skulls, generally, have, rounder, orbits, and, narrower, jaws, male, skulls, on, average, have, larger, broader, palates, squarer, orbits, larger, mastoid, processes, larger, sinuses, and, larger, occipital, condyles, than, those, of, females, male, mandibles, typically, have, squarer, chins, and, thicker, rougher, muscle, attachments, than, female, mandibles, the, cephalic, index, is, the, ratio, of, the, width, of, the, head, multiplied, by, 100, and, divided, by, its, length, front, to, back, the, index, is, also, used, to, categorize, animals, especially, dogs, and, cats, the, width, is, usually, measured, just, below, the, parietal, eminence, and, the, length, from, the, glabella, to, the, occipital, point, humans, may, be, the, vertical, cephalic, index, refers, to, the, ratio, between, the, height, of, the, head, multiplied, by, 100, and, divided, by, the, length, of, the, head, humans, may, be, trepanning, a, practice, in, which, a, hole, is, created, in, the, skull, has, been, described, as, the, oldest, surgical, procedure, for, which, there, is, archaeological, evidence, found, in, the, forms, of, cave, paintings, and, human, remains, at, one, burial, site, in, france, dated, to, 6500, bce, 40, out, of, 120, prehistoric, skulls, found, had, trepanation, holes, this, article, incorporates, text, in, the, public, domain, from, page, 128, of, the, 20th, edition, of, gray, s, anatomy,
