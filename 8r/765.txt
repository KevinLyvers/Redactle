whales, are, a, widely, distributed, and, diverse, group, of, fully, aquatic, placental, marine, mammals, as, an, informal, and, colloquial, grouping, they, correspond, to, large, members, of, the, infraorder, cetacea, i, e, all, cetaceans, apart, from, dolphins, and, porpoises, dolphins, and, porpoises, may, be, considered, whales, from, a, formal, cladistic, perspective, whales, dolphins, and, porpoises, belong, to, the, order, cetartiodactyla, which, consists, of, even, toed, ungulates, their, closest, non, cetacean, living, relatives, are, the, hippopotamuses, from, which, they, and, other, cetaceans, diverged, about, 54, million, years, ago, the, two, parvorders, of, whales, baleen, whales, mysticeti, and, toothed, whales, odontoceti, are, thought, to, have, had, their, last, common, ancestor, around, 34, million, years, ago, mysticetes, include, four, extant, living, families, balaenopteridae, the, rorquals, balaenidae, right, whales, cetotheriidae, the, pygmy, right, whale, and, eschrichtiidae, the, grey, whale, odontocetes, include, the, monodontidae, belugas, and, narwhals, physeteridae, the, sperm, whale, kogiidae, the, dwarf, and, pygmy, sperm, whale, and, ziphiidae, the, beaked, whales, as, well, as, the, six, families, of, dolphins, and, porpoises, which, are, not, considered, whales, in, the, informal, sense, whales, are, fully, aquatic, open, ocean, animals, they, can, feed, mate, give, birth, suckle, and, raise, their, young, at, sea, whales, range, in, size, from, the, 2, 6, metres, 8, 5, ft, and, 135, kilograms, 298, lb, dwarf, sperm, whale, to, the, 29, 9, metres, 98, ft, and, 190, tonnes, 210, short, tons, blue, whale, which, is, the, largest, known, animal, that, has, ever, lived, the, sperm, whale, is, the, largest, toothed, predator, on, earth, several, whale, species, exhibit, sexual, dimorphism, in, that, the, females, are, larger, than, males, baleen, whales, have, no, teeth, instead, they, have, plates, of, baleen, fringe, like, structures, that, enable, them, to, expel, the, huge, mouthfuls, of, water, they, take, in, while, retaining, the, krill, and, plankton, they, feed, on, because, their, heads, are, enormous, making, up, as, much, as, 40, of, their, total, body, mass, and, they, have, throat, pleats, that, enable, them, to, expand, their, mouths, they, are, able, to, take, huge, quantities, of, water, into, their, mouth, at, a, time, baleen, whales, also, have, a, well, developed, sense, of, smell, toothed, whales, in, contrast, have, conical, teeth, adapted, to, catching, fish, or, squid, they, also, have, such, keen, hearing, whether, above, or, below, the, surface, of, the, water, that, some, can, survive, even, if, they, are, blind, some, species, such, as, sperm, whales, are, particularly, well, adapted, for, diving, to, great, depths, to, catch, squid, and, other, favoured, prey, whales, evolved, from, land, living, mammals, and, must, regularly, surface, to, breathe, air, although, they, can, remain, underwater, for, long, periods, of, time, some, species, such, as, the, sperm, whale, can, stay, underwater, for, up, to, 90, minutes, they, have, blowholes, modified, nostrils, located, on, top, of, their, heads, through, which, air, is, taken, in, and, expelled, they, are, warm, blooded, and, have, a, layer, of, fat, or, blubber, under, the, skin, with, streamlined, fusiform, bodies, and, two, limbs, that, are, modified, into, flippers, whales, can, travel, at, speeds, of, up, to, 20, knots, though, they, are, not, as, flexible, or, agile, as, seals, whales, produce, a, great, variety, of, vocalizations, notably, the, extended, songs, of, the, humpback, whale, although, whales, are, widespread, most, species, prefer, the, colder, waters, of, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, and, migrate, to, the, equator, to, give, birth, species, such, as, humpbacks, and, blue, whales, are, capable, of, travelling, thousands, of, miles, without, feeding, males, typically, mate, with, multiple, females, every, year, but, females, only, mate, every, two, to, three, years, calves, are, typically, born, in, the, spring, and, summer, females, bear, all, the, responsibility, for, raising, them, mothers, in, some, species, fast, and, nurse, their, young, for, one, to, two, years, once, relentlessly, hunted, for, their, products, whales, are, now, protected, by, international, law, the, north, atlantic, right, whales, nearly, became, extinct, in, the, twentieth, century, with, a, population, low, of, 450, and, the, north, pacific, grey, whale, population, is, ranked, critically, endangered, by, the, iucn, besides, the, threat, from, whalers, they, also, face, threats, from, bycatch, and, marine, pollution, the, meat, blubber, and, baleen, of, whales, have, traditionally, been, used, by, indigenous, peoples, of, the, arctic, whales, have, been, depicted, in, various, cultures, worldwide, notably, by, the, inuit, and, the, coastal, peoples, of, vietnam, and, ghana, who, sometimes, hold, whale, funerals, whales, occasionally, feature, in, literature, and, film, a, famous, example, is, the, great, white, whale, in, herman, melville, s, novel, moby, dick, small, whales, such, as, belugas, are, sometimes, kept, in, captivity, and, trained, to, perform, tricks, but, breeding, success, has, been, poor, and, the, animals, often, die, within, a, few, months, of, capture, whale, watching, has, become, a, form, of, tourism, around, the, world, the, word, whale, comes, from, the, old, english, hw, l, from, proto, germanic, hwalaz, from, proto, indo, european, s, kwal, o, meaning, large, sea, fish, the, proto, germanic, hwalaz, is, also, the, source, of, old, saxon, hwal, old, norse, hvalr, hvalfiskr, swedish, val, middle, dutch, wal, walvisc, dutch, walvis, old, high, german, wal, and, german, wal, other, archaic, english, forms, include, wal, wale, whal, whalle, whaille, wheal, etc, the, term, whale, is, sometimes, used, interchangeably, with, dolphins, and, porpoises, acting, as, a, synonym, for, cetacea, six, species, of, dolphins, have, the, word, whale, in, their, name, collectively, known, as, blackfish, the, orca, or, killer, whale, the, melon, headed, whale, the, pygmy, killer, whale, the, false, killer, whale, and, the, two, species, of, pilot, whales, all, of, which, are, classified, under, the, family, delphinidae, oceanic, dolphins, each, species, has, a, different, reason, for, it, for, example, the, killer, whale, was, named, ballena, asesina, killer, whale, by, spanish, sailors, the, term, great, whales, covers, those, currently, regulated, by, the, international, whaling, commission, the, odontoceti, family, physeteridae, sperm, whales, and, the, mysticeti, families, balaenidae, right, and, bowhead, whales, eschrichtiidae, grey, whales, and, some, of, the, balaenopteridae, minke, bryde, s, sei, blue, and, fin, not, eden, s, and, omura, s, whales, the, whales, are, part, of, the, largely, terrestrial, mammalian, clade, laurasiatheria, whales, do, not, form, a, clade, or, order, the, infraorder, cetacea, includes, dolphins, and, porpoises, which, are, not, considered, whales, in, the, informal, sense, the, phylogenetic, tree, shows, the, relationships, of, whales, and, other, mammals, with, whale, groups, marked, in, green, carnivorans, and, allies, horses, rhinos, tapirs, camels, llamas, pigs, hogs, peccaries, cattle, sheep, antelopes, hippos, ambulocetus, protocetus, basilosaurus, right, whales, grey, whales, rorquals, dolphins, porpoises, beluga, whales, narwhals, river, dolphins, sperm, whales, beaked, whales, cetaceans, are, divided, into, two, parvorders, the, larger, parvorder, mysticeti, baleen, whales, is, characterized, by, the, presence, of, baleen, a, sieve, like, structure, in, the, upper, jaw, made, of, keratin, which, it, uses, to, filter, plankton, among, others, from, the, water, odontocetes, toothed, whales, are, characterized, by, bearing, sharp, teeth, for, hunting, as, opposed, to, their, counterparts, baleen, cetaceans, and, artiodactyls, now, are, classified, under, the, order, cetartiodactyla, often, still, referred, to, as, artiodactyla, which, includes, both, whales, and, hippopotamuses, the, hippopotamus, and, pygmy, hippopotamus, are, the, whales, closest, terrestrial, living, relatives, mysticetes, are, also, known, as, baleen, whales, they, have, a, pair, of, blowholes, side, by, side, and, lack, teeth, instead, they, have, baleen, plates, which, form, a, sieve, like, structure, in, the, upper, jaw, made, of, keratin, which, they, use, to, filter, plankton, from, the, water, some, whales, such, as, the, humpback, reside, in, the, polar, regions, where, they, feed, on, a, reliable, source, of, schooling, fish, and, krill, these, animals, rely, on, their, well, developed, flippers, and, tail, fin, to, propel, themselves, through, the, water, they, swim, by, moving, their, fore, flippers, and, tail, fin, up, and, down, whale, ribs, loosely, articulate, with, their, thoracic, vertebrae, at, the, proximal, end, but, do, not, form, a, rigid, rib, cage, this, adaptation, allows, the, chest, to, compress, during, deep, dives, as, the, pressure, increases, mysticetes, consist, of, four, families, rorquals, balaenopterids, cetotheriids, right, whales, balaenids, and, grey, whales, eschrichtiids, the, main, difference, between, each, family, of, mysticete, is, in, their, feeding, adaptations, and, subsequent, behaviour, balaenopterids, are, the, rorquals, these, animals, along, with, the, cetotheriids, rely, on, their, throat, pleats, to, gulp, large, amounts, of, water, while, feeding, the, throat, pleats, extend, from, the, mouth, to, the, navel, and, allow, the, mouth, to, expand, to, a, large, volume, for, more, efficient, capture, of, the, small, animals, they, feed, on, balaenopterids, consist, of, two, genera, and, eight, species, balaenids, are, the, right, whales, these, animals, have, very, large, heads, which, can, make, up, as, much, as, 40, of, their, body, mass, and, much, of, the, head, is, the, mouth, this, allows, them, to, take, in, large, amounts, of, water, into, their, mouths, letting, them, feed, more, effectively, eschrichtiids, have, one, living, member, the, grey, whale, they, are, bottom, feeders, mainly, eating, crustaceans, and, benthic, invertebrates, they, feed, by, turning, on, their, sides, and, taking, in, water, mixed, with, sediment, which, is, then, expelled, through, the, baleen, leaving, their, prey, trapped, inside, this, is, an, efficient, method, of, hunting, in, which, the, whale, has, no, major, competitors, odontocetes, are, known, as, toothed, whales, they, have, teeth, and, only, one, blowhole, they, rely, on, their, well, developed, sonar, to, find, their, way, in, the, water, toothed, whales, send, out, ultrasonic, clicks, using, the, melon, sound, waves, travel, through, the, water, upon, striking, an, object, in, the, water, the, sound, waves, bounce, back, at, the, whale, these, vibrations, are, received, through, fatty, tissues, in, the, jaw, which, is, then, rerouted, into, the, ear, bone, and, into, the, brain, where, the, vibrations, are, interpreted, all, toothed, whales, are, opportunistic, meaning, they, will, eat, anything, they, can, fit, in, their, throat, because, they, are, unable, to, chew, these, animals, rely, on, their, well, developed, flippers, and, tail, fin, to, propel, themselves, through, the, water, they, swim, by, moving, their, fore, flippers, and, tail, fin, up, and, down, whale, ribs, loosely, articulate, with, their, thoracic, vertebrae, at, the, proximal, end, but, they, do, not, form, a, rigid, rib, cage, this, adaptation, allows, the, chest, to, compress, during, deep, dives, as, opposed, to, resisting, the, force, of, water, pressure, excluding, dolphins, and, porpoises, odontocetes, consist, of, four, families, belugas, and, narwhals, monodontids, sperm, whales, physeterids, dwarf, and, pygmy, sperm, whales, kogiids, and, beaked, whales, ziphiids, the, differences, between, families, of, odontocetes, include, size, feeding, adaptations, and, distribution, monodontids, consist, of, two, species, the, beluga, and, the, narwhal, they, both, reside, in, the, frigid, arctic, and, both, have, large, amounts, of, blubber, belugas, being, white, hunt, in, large, pods, near, the, surface, and, around, pack, ice, their, coloration, acting, as, camouflage, narwhals, being, black, hunt, in, large, pods, in, the, aphotic, zone, but, their, underbelly, still, remains, white, to, remain, camouflaged, when, something, is, looking, directly, up, or, down, at, them, they, have, no, dorsal, fin, to, prevent, collision, with, pack, ice, physeterids, and, kogiids, consist, of, sperm, whales, sperm, whales, consist, the, largest, and, smallest, odontocetes, and, spend, a, large, portion, of, their, life, hunting, squid, p, macrocephalus, spends, most, of, its, life, in, search, of, squid, in, the, depths, these, animals, do, not, require, any, degree, of, light, at, all, in, fact, blind, sperm, whales, have, been, caught, in, perfect, health, the, behaviour, of, kogiids, remains, largely, unknown, but, due, to, their, small, lungs, they, are, thought, to, hunt, in, the, photic, zone, ziphiids, consist, of, 22, species, of, beaked, whale, these, vary, from, size, to, coloration, to, distribution, but, they, all, share, a, similar, hunting, style, they, use, a, suction, technique, aided, by, a, pair, of, grooves, on, the, underside, of, their, head, not, unlike, the, throat, pleats, on, the, rorquals, to, feed, as, a, formal, clade, a, group, which, does, not, exclude, any, descendant, taxon, odontocetes, also, contains, the, porpoises, phocoenidae, and, four, or, five, living, families, of, dolphins, oceanic, dolphins, delphinidae, south, asian, river, dolphins, platanistidae, the, possibly, extinct, yangtze, river, dolphin, lipotidae, south, american, river, dolphins, iniidae, and, la, plata, dolphin, pontoporiidae, whales, are, descendants, of, land, dwelling, mammals, of, the, artiodactyl, order, even, toed, ungulates, they, are, related, to, the, indohyus, an, extinct, chevrotain, like, ungulate, from, which, they, split, approximately, 48, million, years, ago, primitive, cetaceans, or, archaeocetes, first, took, to, the, sea, approximately, 49, million, years, ago, and, became, fully, aquatic, 5, 10, million, years, later, what, defines, an, archaeocete, is, the, presence, of, anatomical, features, exclusive, to, cetaceans, alongside, other, primitive, features, not, found, in, modern, cetaceans, such, as, visible, legs, or, asymmetrical, teeth, their, features, became, adapted, for, living, in, the, marine, environment, major, anatomical, changes, included, their, hearing, set, up, that, channeled, vibrations, from, the, jaw, to, the, earbone, ambulocetus, 49, mya, a, streamlined, body, and, the, growth, of, flukes, on, the, tail, protocetus, 43, mya, the, migration, of, the, nostrils, toward, the, top, of, the, cranium, blowholes, and, the, modification, of, the, forelimbs, into, flippers, basilosaurus, 35, mya, and, the, shrinking, and, eventual, disappearance, of, the, hind, limbs, the, first, odontocetes, and, mysticetes, 34, mya, whale, morphology, shows, several, examples, of, convergent, evolution, the, most, obvious, being, the, streamlined, fish, like, body, shape, other, examples, include, the, use, of, echolocation, for, hunting, in, low, light, conditions, which, is, the, same, hearing, adaptation, used, by, bats, and, in, the, rorqual, whales, jaw, adaptations, similar, to, those, found, in, pelicans, that, enable, engulfment, feeding, today, the, closest, living, relatives, of, cetaceans, are, the, hippopotamuses, these, share, a, semi, aquatic, ancestor, that, branched, off, from, other, artiodactyls, some, 60, mya, around, 40, mya, a, common, ancestor, between, the, two, branched, off, into, cetacea, and, anthracotheres, nearly, all, anthracotheres, became, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, 2, 5, mya, eventually, leaving, only, one, surviving, lineage, the, hippopotamus, whales, split, into, two, separate, parvorders, around, 34, mya, the, baleen, whales, mysticetes, and, the, toothed, whales, odontocetes, whales, have, torpedo, shaped, bodies, with, non, flexible, necks, limbs, modified, into, flippers, non, existent, external, ear, flaps, a, large, tail, fin, and, flat, heads, with, the, exception, of, monodontids, and, ziphiids, whale, skulls, have, small, eye, orbits, long, snouts, with, the, exception, of, monodontids, and, ziphiids, and, eyes, placed, on, the, sides, of, its, head, whales, range, in, size, from, the, 2, 6, metre, 8, 5, ft, and, 135, kilogram, 298, lb, dwarf, sperm, whale, to, the, 34, metre, 112, ft, and, 190, metric, ton, 210, short, ton, blue, whale, overall, they, tend, to, dwarf, other, cetartiodactyls, the, blue, whale, is, the, largest, creature, on, earth, several, species, have, female, biased, sexual, dimorphism, with, the, females, being, larger, than, the, males, one, exception, is, with, the, sperm, whale, which, has, males, larger, than, the, females, odontocetes, such, as, the, sperm, whale, possess, teeth, with, cementum, cells, overlying, dentine, cells, unlike, human, teeth, which, are, composed, mostly, of, enamel, on, the, portion, of, the, tooth, outside, of, the, gum, whale, teeth, have, cementum, outside, the, gum, only, in, larger, whales, where, the, cementum, is, worn, away, on, the, tip, of, the, tooth, does, enamel, show, mysticetes, have, large, whalebone, as, opposed, to, teeth, made, of, keratin, mysticetes, have, two, blowholes, whereas, odontocetes, contain, only, one, breathing, involves, expelling, stale, air, from, the, blowhole, forming, an, upward, steamy, spout, followed, by, inhaling, fresh, air, into, the, lungs, a, humpback, whale, s, lungs, can, hold, about, 5, 000, litres, 1, 300, us, gal, of, air, spout, shapes, differ, among, species, which, facilitates, identification, all, whales, have, a, thick, layer, of, blubber, in, species, that, live, near, the, poles, the, blubber, can, be, as, thick, as, 11, inches, 28, cm, this, blubber, can, help, with, buoyancy, which, is, helpful, for, a, 100, ton, whale, protection, to, some, extent, as, predators, would, have, a, hard, time, getting, through, a, thick, layer, of, fat, and, energy, for, fasting, when, migrating, to, the, equator, the, primary, usage, for, blubber, is, insulation, from, the, harsh, climate, it, can, constitute, as, much, as, 50, of, a, whale, s, body, weight, calves, are, born, with, only, a, thin, layer, of, blubber, but, some, species, compensate, for, this, with, thick, lanugos, whales, have, a, two, to, three, chambered, stomach, that, is, similar, in, structure, to, those, of, terrestrial, carnivores, mysticetes, contain, a, proventriculus, as, an, extension, of, the, oesophagus, this, contains, stones, that, grind, up, food, they, also, have, fundic, and, pyloric, chambers, whales, have, two, flippers, on, the, front, and, a, tail, fin, these, flippers, contain, four, or, five, digits, though, some, are, polydactyls, although, whales, do, not, possess, fully, developed, hind, limbs, some, such, as, the, sperm, whale, and, bowhead, whale, possess, discrete, rudimentary, appendages, which, may, contain, feet, and, digits, whales, are, fast, swimmers, in, comparison, to, seals, which, typically, cruise, at, 5, 15, kn, or, 9, 28, kilometres, per, hour, 5, 6, 17, 4, mph, the, fin, whale, in, comparison, can, travel, at, speeds, up, to, 47, kilometres, per, hour, 29, mph, and, the, sperm, whale, can, reach, speeds, of, 35, kilometres, per, hour, 22, mph, the, fusing, of, the, neck, vertebrae, while, increasing, stability, when, swimming, at, high, speeds, decreases, flexibility, whales, are, unable, to, turn, their, heads, when, swimming, whales, rely, on, their, tail, fin, to, propel, them, through, the, water, flipper, movement, is, continuous, whales, swim, by, moving, their, tail, fin, and, lower, body, up, and, down, propelling, themselves, through, vertical, movement, while, their, flippers, are, mainly, used, for, steering, some, species, log, out, of, the, water, which, may, allow, them, to, travel, faster, their, skeletal, anatomy, allows, them, to, be, fast, swimmers, most, species, have, a, dorsal, fin, whales, are, adapted, for, diving, to, great, depths, in, addition, to, their, streamlined, bodies, they, can, slow, their, heart, rate, to, conserve, oxygen, blood, is, rerouted, from, tissue, tolerant, of, water, pressure, to, the, heart, and, brain, among, other, organs, haemoglobin, and, myoglobin, store, oxygen, in, body, tissue, and, they, have, twice, the, concentration, of, myoglobin, than, haemoglobin, before, going, on, long, dives, many, whales, exhibit, a, behaviour, known, as, sounding, they, stay, close, to, the, surface, for, a, series, of, short, shallow, dives, while, building, their, oxygen, reserves, and, then, make, a, sounding, dive, the, whale, ear, has, specific, adaptations, to, the, marine, environment, in, humans, the, middle, ear, works, as, an, impedance, equalizer, between, the, outside, air, s, low, impedance, and, the, cochlear, fluid, s, high, impedance, in, whales, and, other, marine, mammals, there, is, no, great, difference, between, the, outer, and, inner, environments, instead, of, sound, passing, through, the, outer, ear, to, the, middle, ear, whales, receive, sound, through, the, throat, from, which, it, passes, through, a, low, impedance, fat, filled, cavity, to, the, inner, ear, the, whale, ear, is, acoustically, isolated, from, the, skull, by, air, filled, sinus, pockets, which, allow, for, greater, directional, hearing, underwater, odontocetes, send, out, high, frequency, clicks, from, an, organ, known, as, a, melon, this, melon, consists, of, fat, and, the, skull, of, any, such, creature, containing, a, melon, will, have, a, large, depression, the, melon, size, varies, between, species, the, bigger, the, more, dependent, they, are, on, it, a, beaked, whale, for, example, has, a, small, bulge, sitting, on, top, of, its, skull, whereas, a, sperm, whale, s, head, is, filled, up, mainly, with, the, melon, the, whale, eye, is, relatively, small, for, its, size, yet, they, do, retain, a, good, degree, of, eyesight, as, well, as, this, the, eyes, of, a, whale, are, placed, on, the, sides, of, its, head, so, their, vision, consists, of, two, fields, rather, than, a, binocular, view, like, humans, have, when, belugas, surface, their, lens, and, cornea, correct, the, nearsightedness, that, results, from, the, refraction, of, light, they, contain, both, rod, and, cone, cells, meaning, they, can, see, in, both, dim, and, bright, light, but, they, have, far, more, rod, cells, than, they, do, cone, cells, whales, do, however, lack, short, wavelength, sensitive, visual, pigments, in, their, cone, cells, indicating, a, more, limited, capacity, for, colour, vision, than, most, mammals, most, whales, have, slightly, flattened, eyeballs, enlarged, pupils, which, shrink, as, they, surface, to, prevent, damage, slightly, flattened, corneas, and, a, tapetum, lucidum, these, adaptations, allow, for, large, amounts, of, light, to, pass, through, the, eye, and, therefore, a, very, clear, image, of, the, surrounding, area, they, also, have, glands, on, the, eyelids, and, outer, corneal, layer, that, act, as, protection, for, the, cornea, the, olfactory, lobes, are, absent, in, toothed, whales, suggesting, that, they, have, no, sense, of, smell, some, whales, such, as, the, bowhead, whale, possess, a, vomeronasal, organ, which, does, mean, that, they, can, sniff, out, krill, whales, are, not, thought, to, have, a, good, sense, of, taste, as, their, taste, buds, are, atrophied, or, missing, altogether, however, some, toothed, whales, have, preferences, between, different, kinds, of, fish, indicating, some, sort, of, attachment, to, taste, the, presence, of, the, jacobson, s, organ, indicates, that, whales, can, smell, food, once, inside, their, mouth, which, might, be, similar, to, the, sensation, of, taste, whale, vocalization, is, likely, to, serve, several, purposes, some, species, such, as, the, humpback, whale, communicate, using, melodic, sounds, known, as, whale, song, these, sounds, may, be, extremely, loud, depending, on, the, species, humpback, whales, only, have, been, heard, making, clicks, while, toothed, whales, use, sonar, that, may, generate, up, to, 20, 000, watts, of, sound, 73, dbm, or, 43, dbw, and, be, heard, for, many, miles, captive, whales, have, occasionally, been, known, to, mimic, human, speech, scientists, have, suggested, this, indicates, a, strong, desire, on, behalf, of, the, whales, to, communicate, with, humans, as, whales, have, a, very, different, vocal, mechanism, so, imitating, human, speech, likely, takes, considerable, effort, whales, emit, two, distinct, kinds, of, acoustic, signals, which, are, called, whistles, and, clicks, clicks, are, quick, broadband, burst, pulses, used, for, sonar, although, some, lower, frequency, broadband, vocalizations, may, serve, a, non, echolocative, purpose, such, as, communication, for, example, the, pulsed, calls, of, belugas, pulses, in, a, click, train, are, emitted, at, intervals, of, 35, 50, milliseconds, and, in, general, these, inter, click, intervals, are, slightly, greater, than, the, round, trip, time, of, sound, to, the, target, whistles, are, narrow, band, frequency, modulated, fm, signals, used, for, communicative, purposes, such, as, contact, calls, whales, are, known, to, teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and, grieve, the, neocortex, of, many, species, of, whale, is, home, to, elongated, spindle, neurons, that, prior, to, 2007, were, known, only, in, hominids, in, humans, these, cells, are, involved, in, social, conduct, emotions, judgement, and, theory, of, mind, whale, spindle, neurons, are, found, in, areas, of, the, brain, that, are, homologous, to, where, they, are, found, in, humans, suggesting, that, they, perform, a, similar, function, brain, size, was, previously, considered, a, major, indicator, of, the, intelligence, of, an, animal, since, most, of, the, brain, is, used, for, maintaining, bodily, functions, greater, ratios, of, brain, to, body, mass, may, increase, the, amount, of, brain, mass, available, for, more, complex, cognitive, tasks, allometric, analysis, indicates, that, mammalian, brain, size, scales, at, approximately, the, or, exponent, of, the, body, mass, comparison, of, a, particular, animal, s, brain, size, with, the, expected, brain, size, based, on, such, allometric, analysis, provides, an, encephalisation, quotient, that, can, be, used, as, another, indication, of, animal, intelligence, sperm, whales, have, the, largest, brain, mass, of, any, animal, on, earth, averaging, 8, 000, cubic, centimetres, 490, in, 3, and, 7, 8, kilograms, 17, lb, in, mature, males, in, comparison, to, the, average, human, brain, which, averages, 1, 450, cubic, centimetres, 88, in, 3, in, mature, males, the, brain, to, body, mass, ratio, in, some, odontocetes, such, as, belugas, and, narwhals, is, second, only, to, humans, small, whales, are, known, to, engage, in, complex, play, behaviour, which, includes, such, things, as, producing, stable, underwater, toroidal, air, core, vortex, rings, or, bubble, rings, there, are, two, main, methods, of, bubble, ring, production, rapid, puffing, of, a, burst, of, air, into, the, water, and, allowing, it, to, rise, to, the, surface, forming, a, ring, or, swimming, repeatedly, in, a, circle, and, then, stopping, to, inject, air, into, the, helical, vortex, currents, thus, formed, they, also, appear, to, enjoy, biting, the, vortex, rings, so, that, they, burst, into, many, separate, bubbles, and, then, rise, quickly, to, the, surface, some, believe, this, is, a, means, of, communication, whales, are, also, known, to, produce, bubble, nets, for, the, purpose, of, foraging, larger, whales, are, also, thought, to, some, degree, to, engage, in, play, the, southern, right, whale, for, example, elevates, their, tail, fluke, above, the, water, remaining, in, the, same, position, for, a, considerable, amount, of, time, this, is, known, as, sailing, it, appears, to, be, a, form, of, play, and, is, most, commonly, seen, off, the, coast, of, argentina, and, south, africa, humpback, whales, among, others, are, also, known, to, display, this, behaviour, whales, are, fully, aquatic, creatures, which, means, that, birth, and, courtship, behaviours, are, very, different, from, terrestrial, and, semi, aquatic, creatures, since, they, are, unable, to, go, onto, land, to, calve, they, deliver, the, baby, with, the, fetus, positioned, for, tail, first, delivery, this, prevents, the, baby, from, drowning, either, upon, or, during, delivery, to, feed, the, newborn, whales, being, aquatic, must, squirt, the, milk, into, the, mouth, of, the, calf, nursing, can, occur, while, the, mother, whale, is, in, the, vertical, or, horizontal, position, while, nursing, in, the, vertical, position, a, mother, whale, may, sometimes, rest, with, her, tail, flukes, remaining, stationary, above, the, water, this, position, with, the, flukes, above, the, water, is, known, as, whale, tail, sailing, not, all, whale, tail, sailing, includes, nursing, of, the, young, as, whales, have, also, been, observed, tail, sailing, while, no, calves, were, present, being, mammals, they, have, mammary, glands, used, for, nursing, calves, weaning, occurs, at, about, 11, months, of, age, this, milk, contains, high, amounts, of, fat, which, is, meant, to, hasten, the, development, of, blubber, it, contains, so, much, fat, that, it, has, the, consistency, of, toothpaste, like, humans, female, whales, typically, deliver, a, single, offspring, whales, have, a, typical, gestation, period, of, 12, months, once, born, the, absolute, dependency, of, the, calf, upon, the, mother, lasts, from, one, to, two, years, sexual, maturity, is, achieved, at, around, seven, to, ten, years, of, age, the, length, of, the, developmental, phases, of, a, whale, s, early, life, varies, between, different, whale, species, as, with, humans, the, whale, mode, of, reproduction, typically, produces, but, one, offspring, approximately, once, each, year, while, whales, have, fewer, offspring, over, time, than, most, species, the, probability, of, survival, for, each, calf, is, also, greater, than, for, most, other, species, female, whales, are, referred, to, as, cows, cows, assume, full, responsibility, for, the, care, and, training, of, their, young, male, whales, referred, to, as, bulls, typically, play, no, role, in, the, process, of, calf, rearing, most, baleen, whales, reside, at, the, poles, to, prevent, the, unborn, baleen, whale, calves, from, dying, of, frostbite, the, baleen, mother, must, migrate, to, warmer, calving, mating, grounds, they, will, then, stay, there, for, a, matter, of, months, until, the, calf, has, developed, enough, blubber, to, survive, the, bitter, temperatures, of, the, poles, until, then, the, baleen, calves, will, feed, on, the, mother, s, fatty, milk, with, the, exception, of, the, humpback, whale, it, is, largely, unknown, when, whales, migrate, most, will, travel, from, the, arctic, or, antarctic, into, the, tropics, to, mate, calve, and, raise, their, young, during, the, winter, and, spring, they, will, migrate, back, to, the, poles, in, the, warmer, summer, months, so, the, calf, can, continue, growing, while, the, mother, can, continue, eating, as, they, fast, in, the, breeding, grounds, one, exception, to, this, is, the, southern, right, whale, which, migrates, to, patagonia, and, western, new, zealand, to, calve, both, are, well, out, of, the, tropic, zone, unlike, most, animals, whales, are, conscious, breathers, all, mammals, sleep, but, whales, cannot, afford, to, become, unconscious, for, long, because, they, may, drown, while, knowledge, of, sleep, in, wild, cetaceans, is, limited, toothed, cetaceans, in, captivity, have, been, recorded, to, sleep, with, one, side, of, their, brain, at, a, time, so, that, they, may, swim, breathe, consciously, and, avoid, both, predators, and, social, contact, during, their, period, of, rest, a, 2008, study, found, that, sperm, whales, sleep, in, vertical, postures, just, under, the, surface, in, passive, shallow, drift, dives, generally, during, the, day, during, which, whales, do, not, respond, to, passing, vessels, unless, they, are, in, contact, leading, to, the, suggestion, that, whales, possibly, sleep, during, such, dives, all, whales, are, carnivorous, and, predatory, odontocetes, as, a, whole, mostly, feed, on, fish, and, cephalopods, and, then, followed, by, crustaceans, and, bivalves, all, species, are, generalist, and, opportunistic, feeders, mysticetes, as, a, whole, mostly, feed, on, krill, and, plankton, followed, by, crustaceans, and, other, invertebrates, a, few, are, specialists, examples, include, the, blue, whale, which, eats, almost, exclusively, krill, the, minke, whale, which, eats, mainly, schooling, fish, the, sperm, whale, which, specialize, on, squid, and, the, grey, whale, which, feed, on, bottom, dwelling, invertebrates, the, elaborate, baleen, teeth, of, filter, feeding, species, mysticetes, allow, them, to, remove, water, before, they, swallow, their, planktonic, food, by, using, the, teeth, as, a, sieve, usually, whales, hunt, solitarily, but, they, do, sometimes, hunt, cooperatively, in, small, groups, the, former, behaviour, is, typical, when, hunting, non, schooling, fish, slow, moving, or, immobile, invertebrates, or, endothermic, prey, when, large, amounts, of, prey, are, available, whales, such, as, certain, mysticetes, hunt, cooperatively, in, small, groups, some, cetaceans, may, forage, with, other, kinds, of, animals, such, as, other, species, of, whales, or, certain, species, of, pinnipeds, large, whales, such, as, mysticetes, are, not, usually, subject, to, predation, but, smaller, whales, such, as, monodontids, or, ziphiids, are, these, species, are, preyed, on, by, the, orca, to, subdue, and, kill, whales, orcas, continuously, ram, them, with, their, heads, this, can, sometimes, kill, bowhead, whales, or, severely, injure, them, other, times, they, corral, the, narwhals, or, belugas, before, striking, they, are, typically, hunted, by, groups, of, 10, or, fewer, orcas, but, they, are, seldom, attacked, by, an, individual, calves, are, more, commonly, taken, by, orcas, but, adults, can, be, targeted, as, well, these, small, whales, are, also, targeted, by, terrestrial, and, pagophilic, predators, the, polar, bear, is, well, adapted, for, hunting, arctic, whales, and, calves, bears, are, known, to, use, sit, and, wait, tactics, as, well, as, active, stalking, and, pursuit, of, prey, on, ice, or, water, whales, lessen, the, chance, of, predation, by, gathering, in, groups, this, however, means, less, room, around, the, breathing, hole, as, the, ice, slowly, closes, the, gap, when, out, at, sea, whales, dive, out, of, the, reach, of, surface, hunting, orcas, polar, bear, attacks, on, belugas, and, narwhals, are, usually, successful, in, winter, but, rarely, inflict, any, damage, in, summer, a, 2010, study, considered, whales, to, be, a, positive, influence, to, the, productivity, of, ocean, fisheries, in, what, has, been, termed, a, whale, pump, whales, carry, nutrients, such, as, nitrogen, from, the, depths, back, to, the, surface, this, functions, as, an, upward, biological, pump, reversing, an, earlier, presumption, that, whales, accelerate, the, loss, of, nutrients, to, the, bottom, this, nitrogen, input, in, the, gulf, of, maine, is, more, than, the, input, of, all, rivers, combined, emptying, into, the, gulf, some, 23, 000, metric, tons, 25, 000, short, tons, each, year, whales, defecate, at, the, ocean, s, surface, their, excrement, is, important, for, fisheries, because, it, is, rich, in, iron, and, nitrogen, the, whale, faeces, are, liquid, and, instead, of, sinking, they, stay, at, the, surface, where, phytoplankton, feed, off, it, upon, death, whale, carcasses, fall, to, the, deep, ocean, and, provide, a, substantial, habitat, for, marine, life, evidence, of, whale, falls, in, present, day, and, fossil, records, shows, that, deep, sea, whale, falls, support, a, rich, assemblage, of, creatures, with, a, global, diversity, of, 407, species, comparable, to, other, neritic, biodiversity, hotspots, such, as, cold, seeps, and, hydrothermal, vents, deterioration, of, whale, carcasses, happens, though, a, series, of, three, stages, initially, moving, organisms, such, as, sharks, and, hagfish, scavenge, the, soft, tissues, at, a, rapid, rate, over, a, period, of, months, and, as, long, as, two, years, this, is, followed, by, the, colonization, of, bones, and, surrounding, sediments, which, contain, organic, matter, by, enrichment, opportunists, such, as, crustaceans, and, polychaetes, throughout, a, period, of, years, finally, sulfophilic, bacteria, reduce, the, bones, releasing, hydrogen, sulfide, enabling, the, growth, of, chemoautotrophic, organisms, which, in, turn, support, other, organisms, such, as, mussels, clams, limpets, and, sea, snails, this, stage, may, last, for, decades, and, supports, a, rich, assemblage, of, species, averaging, 185, species, per, site, whaling, by, humans, has, existed, since, the, stone, age, ancient, whalers, used, harpoons, to, spear, the, bigger, animals, from, boats, out, at, sea, people, from, norway, and, japan, started, hunting, whales, around, 2000, b, c, whales, are, typically, hunted, for, their, meat, and, blubber, by, aboriginal, groups, they, used, baleen, for, baskets, or, roofing, and, made, tools, and, masks, out, of, bones, the, inuit, hunted, whales, in, the, arctic, ocean, the, basques, started, whaling, as, early, as, the, 11th, century, sailing, as, far, as, newfoundland, in, the, 16th, century, in, search, of, right, whales, 18th, and, 19th, century, whalers, hunted, whales, mainly, for, their, oil, which, was, used, as, lamp, fuel, and, a, lubricant, baleen, or, whalebone, which, was, used, for, items, such, as, corsets, and, skirt, hoops, and, ambergris, which, was, used, as, a, fixative, for, perfumes, the, most, successful, whaling, nations, at, this, time, were, the, netherlands, japan, and, the, united, states, commercial, whaling, was, historically, important, as, an, industry, well, throughout, the, 17th, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, whaling, was, at, that, time, a, sizeable, european, industry, with, ships, from, britain, france, spain, denmark, the, netherlands, and, germany, sometimes, collaborating, to, hunt, whales, in, the, arctic, sometimes, in, competition, leading, even, to, war, by, the, early, 1790s, whalers, namely, the, americans, and, australians, focused, efforts, in, the, south, pacific, where, they, mainly, hunted, sperm, whales, and, right, whales, with, catches, of, up, to, 39, 000, right, whales, by, americans, alone, by, 1853, us, profits, reached, us, 11, 000, 000, 6, 5m, equivalent, to, us, 348, 000, 000, 230m, today, the, most, profitable, year, for, the, american, whaling, industry, commonly, exploited, species, included, north, atlantic, right, whales, sperm, whales, which, were, mainly, hunted, by, americans, bowhead, whales, which, were, mainly, hunted, by, the, dutch, common, minke, whales, blue, whales, and, grey, whales, the, scale, of, whale, harvesting, decreased, substantially, after, 1982, when, the, international, whaling, commission, iwc, placed, a, moratorium, which, set, a, catch, limit, for, each, country, excluding, aboriginal, groups, until, 2004, current, whaling, nations, are, norway, iceland, and, japan, despite, their, joining, to, the, iwc, as, well, as, the, aboriginal, communities, of, siberia, alaska, and, northern, canada, subsistence, hunters, typically, use, whale, products, for, themselves, and, depend, on, them, for, survival, national, and, international, authorities, have, given, special, treatment, to, aboriginal, hunters, since, their, methods, of, hunting, are, seen, as, less, destructive, and, wasteful, this, distinction, is, being, questioned, as, these, aboriginal, groups, are, using, more, modern, weaponry, and, mechanized, transport, to, hunt, with, and, are, selling, whale, products, in, the, marketplace, some, anthropologists, argue, that, the, term, subsistence, should, also, apply, to, these, cash, based, exchanges, as, long, as, they, take, place, within, local, production, and, consumption, in, 1946, the, iwc, placed, a, moratorium, limiting, the, annual, whale, catch, since, then, yearly, profits, for, these, subsistence, hunters, have, been, close, to, us, 31, million, 20m, per, year, whales, can, also, be, threatened, by, humans, more, indirectly, they, are, unintentionally, caught, in, fishing, nets, by, commercial, fisheries, as, bycatch, and, accidentally, swallow, fishing, hooks, gillnetting, and, seine, netting, is, a, significant, cause, of, mortality, in, whales, and, other, marine, mammals, species, commonly, entangled, include, beaked, whales, whales, are, also, affected, by, marine, pollution, high, levels, of, organic, chemicals, accumulate, in, these, animals, since, they, are, high, in, the, food, chain, they, have, large, reserves, of, blubber, more, so, for, toothed, whales, as, they, are, higher, up, the, food, chain, than, baleen, whales, lactating, mothers, can, pass, the, toxins, on, to, their, young, these, pollutants, can, cause, gastrointestinal, cancers, and, greater, vulnerability, to, infectious, diseases, they, can, also, be, poisoned, by, swallowing, litter, such, as, plastic, bags, advanced, military, sonar, harms, whales, sonar, interferes, with, the, basic, biological, functions, of, whales, such, as, feeding, and, mating, by, impacting, their, ability, to, echolocate, whales, swim, in, response, to, sonar, and, sometimes, experience, decompression, sickness, due, to, rapid, changes, in, depth, mass, strandings, have, been, triggered, by, sonar, activity, resulting, in, injury, or, death, whales, are, sometimes, killed, or, injured, during, collisions, with, ships, or, boats, this, is, considered, to, be, a, significant, threat, to, vulnerable, whale, populations, such, as, the, north, atlantic, right, whale, whose, total, population, numbers, less, than, 500, whaling, decreased, substantially, after, 1946, when, in, response, to, the, steep, decline, in, whale, populations, the, international, whaling, commission, placed, a, moratorium, which, set, a, catch, limit, for, each, country, this, excluded, aboriginal, groups, up, until, 2004, as, of, 2015, aboriginal, communities, are, allowed, to, take, 280, bowhead, whales, off, alaska, and, two, from, the, western, coast, of, greenland, 620, grey, whales, off, washington, state, three, common, minke, whales, off, the, eastern, coast, of, greenland, and, 178, on, their, western, coast, 10, fin, whales, from, the, west, coast, of, greenland, nine, humpback, whales, from, the, west, coast, of, greenland, and, 20, off, st, vincent, and, the, grenadines, each, year, several, species, that, were, commercially, exploited, have, rebounded, in, numbers, for, example, grey, whales, may, be, as, numerous, as, they, were, prior, to, harvesting, but, the, north, atlantic, population, is, functionally, extinct, conversely, the, north, atlantic, right, whale, was, extirpated, from, much, of, its, former, range, which, stretched, across, the, north, atlantic, and, only, remains, in, small, fragments, along, the, coast, of, canada, greenland, and, is, considered, functionally, extinct, along, the, european, coastline, the, iwc, has, designated, two, whale, sanctuaries, the, southern, ocean, whale, sanctuary, and, the, indian, ocean, whale, sanctuary, the, southern, ocean, whale, sanctuary, spans, 30, 560, 860, square, kilometres, 11, 799, 610, sq, mi, and, envelopes, antarctica, the, indian, ocean, whale,

have, been, created, to, minimize, harassment, of, the, whales, iceland, japan, and, norway, have, both, whaling, and, whale, watching, industries, whale, watching, lobbyists, are, concerned, that, the, most, inquisitive, whales, which, approach, boats, closely, and, provide, much, of, the, entertainment, on, whale, watching, trips, will, be, the, first, to, be, taken, if, whaling, is, resumed, in, the, same, areas, whale, watching, generated, us, 2, 1, billion, 1, 4, billion, per, annum, in, tourism, revenue, worldwide, employing, around, 13, 000, workers, in, contrast, the, whaling, industry, with, the, moratorium, in, place, generates, us, 31, million, 20, million, per, year, the, size, and, rapid, growth, of, the, industry, has, led, to, complex, and, continuing, debates, with, the, whaling, industry, about, the, best, use, of, whales, as, a, natural, resource, as, marine, creatures, that, reside, in, either, the, depths, or, the, poles, humans, knew, very, little, about, whales, over, the, course, of, human, history, many, feared, or, revered, them, the, vikings, and, various, arctic, tribes, revered, the, whale, as, they, were, important, pieces, of, their, lives, in, inuit, creation, myths, when, big, raven, a, deity, in, human, form, found, a, stranded, whale, he, was, told, by, the, great, spirit, where, to, find, special, mushrooms, that, would, give, him, the, strength, to, drag, the, whale, back, to, the, sea, and, thus, return, order, to, the, world, in, an, icelandic, legend, a, man, threw, a, stone, at, a, fin, whale, and, hit, the, blowhole, causing, the, whale, to, burst, the, man, was, told, not, to, go, to, sea, for, twenty, years, but, during, the, nineteenth, year, he, went, fishing, and, a, whale, came, and, killed, him, whales, played, a, major, part, in, shaping, the, art, forms, of, many, coastal, civilizations, such, as, the, norse, with, some, dating, to, the, stone, age, petroglyphs, off, a, cliff, face, in, bangudae, south, korea, show, 300, depictions, of, various, animals, a, third, of, which, are, whales, some, show, particular, detail, in, which, there, are, throat, pleats, typical, of, rorquals, these, petroglyphs, show, these, people, of, around, 7, 000, to, 3, 500, b, c, e, in, south, korea, had, a, very, high, dependency, on, whales, the, pacific, islanders, and, australian, aborigines, viewed, whales, as, bringers, of, good, and, joy, one, exception, is, french, polynesia, where, in, many, parts, cetaceans, are, met, with, great, brutality, in, coastal, regions, of, china, korea, and, vietnam, the, worship, of, whale, gods, who, were, associated, with, dragon, kings, after, the, arrival, of, buddhism, was, present, along, with, related, legends, the, god, of, the, seas, according, to, chinese, folklore, was, a, large, whale, with, human, limbs, in, vietnam, whales, hold, a, sense, of, divinity, they, are, so, respected, in, their, cultures, that, they, occasionally, hold, funerals, for, beached, whales, a, custom, deriving, from, vietnam, s, ancient, sea, based, champa, kingdom, whales, have, also, played, a, role, in, sacred, texts, the, story, of, jonah, being, swallowed, by, a, great, fish, is, told, both, in, the, qur, an, and, in, the, biblical, book, of, jonah, and, is, mentioned, by, jesus, in, the, new, testament, matthew, 12, 40, this, episode, was, frequently, depicted, in, medieval, art, for, example, on, a, 12th, century, column, capital, at, the, abbey, church, of, mozac, france, the, bible, also, mentions, whales, in, genesis, 1, 21, job, 7, 12, and, ezekiel, 32, 2, the, leviathan, described, at, length, in, job, 41, 1, 34, is, generally, understood, to, refer, to, a, whale, the, sea, monsters, in, lamentations, 4, 3, have, been, taken, by, some, to, refer, to, marine, mammals, in, particular, whales, although, most, modern, versions, use, the, word, jackals, instead, in, 1585, alessandro, farnese, 1585, and, francois, duke, of, anjou, 1582, were, greeted, on, his, ceremonial, entry, into, the, port, city, of, antwerp, by, floats, including, neptune, and, the, whale, indicating, at, least, the, city, s, dependence, on, the, sea, for, its, wealth, in, 1896, an, article, in, the, pall, mall, gazette, popularised, a, practice, of, alternative, medicine, that, probably, began, in, the, whaling, town, of, eden, australia, two, or, three, years, earlier, it, was, believed, that, climbing, inside, a, whale, carcass, and, remaining, there, for, a, few, hours, would, relieve, symptoms, of, rheumatism, whales, continue, to, be, prevalent, in, modern, literature, for, example, herman, melville, s, moby, dick, features, a, great, white, whale, as, the, main, antagonist, for, ahab, the, whale, is, an, albino, sperm, whale, considered, by, melville, to, be, the, largest, type, of, whale, and, is, partly, based, on, the, historically, attested, bull, whale, mocha, dick, rudyard, kipling, s, just, so, stories, includes,
