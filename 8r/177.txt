a, carbohydrate, k, r, b, o, h, a, d, r, e, t, is, a, biomolecule, consisting, of, carbon, c, hydrogen, h, and, oxygen, o, atoms, usually, with, a, hydrogen, oxygen, atom, ratio, of, 2, 1, as, in, water, and, thus, with, the, empirical, formula, c, m, h, 2, o, n, where, m, may, or, may, not, be, different, from, n, which, does, not, mean, the, h, has, covalent, bonds, with, o, for, example, with, ch, 2, o, h, has, a, covalent, bond, with, c, but, not, with, o, however, not, all, carbohydrates, conform, to, this, precise, stoichiometric, definition, e, g, uronic, acids, deoxy, sugars, such, as, fucose, nor, are, all, chemicals, that, do, conform, to, this, definition, automatically, classified, as, carbohydrates, e, g, formaldehyde, and, acetic, acid, the, term, is, most, common, in, biochemistry, where, it, is, a, synonym, of, saccharide, from, ancient, greek, s, kkharon, sugar, a, group, that, includes, sugars, starch, and, cellulose, the, saccharides, are, divided, into, four, chemical, groups, monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and, polysaccharides, monosaccharides, and, disaccharides, the, smallest, lower, molecular, weight, carbohydrates, are, commonly, referred, to, as, sugars, while, the, scientific, nomenclature, of, carbohydrates, is, complex, the, names, of, the, monosaccharides, and, disaccharides, very, often, end, in, the, suffix, ose, which, was, originally, taken, from, the, word, glucose, from, ancient, greek, gle, kos, wine, must, and, is, used, for, almost, all, sugars, e, g, fructose, fruit, sugar, sucrose, cane, or, beet, sugar, ribose, lactose, milk, sugar, carbohydrates, perform, numerous, roles, in, living, organisms, polysaccharides, serve, as, an, energy, store, e, g, starch, and, glycogen, and, as, structural, components, e, g, cellulose, in, plants, and, chitin, in, arthropods, and, fungi, the, 5, carbon, monosaccharide, ribose, is, an, important, component, of, coenzymes, e, g, atp, fad, and, nad, and, the, backbone, of, the, genetic, molecule, known, as, rna, the, related, deoxyribose, is, a, component, of, dna, saccharides, and, their, derivatives, include, many, other, important, biomolecules, that, play, key, roles, in, the, immune, system, fertilization, preventing, pathogenesis, blood, clotting, and, development, carbohydrates, are, central, to, nutrition, and, are, found, in, a, wide, variety, of, natural, and, processed, foods, starch, is, a, polysaccharide, and, is, abundant, in, cereals, wheat, maize, rice, potatoes, and, processed, food, based, on, cereal, flour, such, as, bread, pizza, or, pasta, sugars, appear, in, human, diet, mainly, as, table, sugar, sucrose, extracted, from, sugarcane, or, sugar, beets, lactose, abundant, in, milk, glucose, and, fructose, both, of, which, occur, naturally, in, honey, many, fruits, and, some, vegetables, table, sugar, milk, or, honey, is, often, added, to, drinks, and, many, prepared, foods, such, as, jam, biscuits, and, cakes, cellulose, a, polysaccharide, found, in, the, cell, walls, of, all, plants, is, one, of, the, main, components, of, insoluble, dietary, fiber, although, it, is, not, digestible, by, humans, cellulose, and, insoluble, dietary, fiber, generally, help, maintain, a, healthy, digestive, system, by, facilitating, bowel, movements, other, polysaccharides, contained, in, dietary, fiber, include, resistant, starch, and, inulin, which, feed, some, bacteria, in, the, microbiota, of, the, large, intestine, and, are, metabolized, by, these, bacteria, to, yield, short, chain, fatty, acids, in, scientific, literature, the, term, carbohydrate, has, many, synonyms, like, sugar, in, the, broad, sense, saccharide, ose, glucide, hydrate, of, carbon, or, polyhydroxy, compounds, with, aldehyde, or, ketone, some, of, these, terms, especially, carbohydrate, and, sugar, are, also, used, with, other, meanings, in, food, science, and, in, many, informal, contexts, the, term, carbohydrate, often, means, any, food, that, is, particularly, rich, in, the, complex, carbohydrate, starch, such, as, cereals, bread, and, pasta, or, simple, carbohydrates, such, as, sugar, found, in, candy, jams, and, desserts, this, informality, is, sometimes, confusing, since, it, confounds, chemical, structure, and, digestibility, in, humans, often, in, lists, of, nutritional, information, such, as, the, usda, national, nutrient, database, the, term, carbohydrate, or, carbohydrate, by, difference, is, used, for, everything, other, than, water, protein, fat, ash, and, ethanol, this, includes, chemical, compounds, such, as, acetic, or, lactic, acid, which, are, not, normally, considered, carbohydrates, it, also, includes, dietary, fiber, which, is, a, carbohydrate, but, which, does, not, contribute, food, energy, in, humans, even, though, it, is, often, included, in, the, calculation, of, total, food, energy, just, as, though, it, did, i, e, as, if, it, were, a, digestible, and, absorbable, carbohydrate, such, as, a, sugar, in, the, strict, sense, sugar, is, applied, for, sweet, soluble, carbohydrates, many, of, which, are, used, in, human, food, the, history, of, the, discovery, regarding, carbohydrates, dates, back, around, 10, 000, years, ago, in, papua, new, guinea, during, the, cultivation, of, sugarcane, during, the, neolithic, agricultural, revolution, the, term, carbohydrate, was, first, proposed, by, german, chemist, carl, schmidt, chemist, in, 1844, in, 1856, glycogen, a, form, of, carbohydrate, storage, in, animal, livers, was, discovered, by, french, physiologist, claude, bernard, formerly, the, name, carbohydrate, was, used, in, chemistry, for, any, compound, with, the, formula, c, m, h, 2, o, n, following, this, definition, some, chemists, considered, formaldehyde, ch, 2, o, to, be, the, simplest, carbohydrate, while, others, claimed, that, title, for, glycolaldehyde, today, the, term, is, generally, understood, in, the, biochemistry, sense, which, excludes, compounds, with, only, one, or, two, carbons, and, includes, many, biological, carbohydrates, which, deviate, from, this, formula, for, example, while, the, above, representative, formulas, would, seem, to, capture, the, commonly, known, carbohydrates, ubiquitous, and, abundant, carbohydrates, often, deviate, from, this, for, example, carbohydrates, often, display, chemical, groups, such, as, n, acetyl, e, g, chitin, sulfate, e, g, glycosaminoglycans, carboxylic, acid, and, deoxy, modifications, e, g, fucose, and, sialic, acid, natural, saccharides, are, generally, built, of, simple, carbohydrates, called, monosaccharides, with, general, formula, ch, 2, o, n, where, n, is, three, or, more, a, typical, monosaccharide, has, the, structure, h, choh, x, c, o, choh, y, h, that, is, an, aldehyde, or, ketone, with, many, hydroxyl, groups, added, usually, one, on, each, carbon, atom, that, is, not, part, of, the, aldehyde, or, ketone, functional, group, examples, of, monosaccharides, are, glucose, fructose, and, glyceraldehydes, however, some, biological, substances, commonly, called, monosaccharides, do, not, conform, to, this, formula, e, g, uronic, acids, and, deoxy, sugars, such, as, fucose, and, there, are, many, chemicals, that, do, conform, to, this, formula, but, are, not, considered, to, be, monosaccharides, e, g, formaldehyde, ch, 2, o, and, inositol, ch, 2, o, 6, the, open, chain, form, of, a, monosaccharide, often, coexists, with, a, closed, ring, form, where, the, aldehyde, ketone, carbonyl, group, carbon, c, o, and, hydroxyl, group, oh, react, forming, a, hemiacetal, with, a, new, c, o, c, bridge, monosaccharides, can, be, linked, together, into, what, are, called, polysaccharides, or, oligosaccharides, in, a, large, variety, of, ways, many, carbohydrates, contain, one, or, more, modified, monosaccharide, units, that, have, had, one, or, more, groups, replaced, or, removed, for, example, deoxyribose, a, component, of, dna, is, a, modified, version, of, ribose, chitin, is, composed, of, repeating, units, of, n, acetyl, glucosamine, a, nitrogen, containing, form, of, glucose, carbohydrates, are, polyhydroxy, aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, acids, their, simple, derivatives, and, their, polymers, having, linkages, of, the, acetal, type, they, may, be, classified, according, to, their, degree, of, polymerization, and, may, be, divided, initially, into, three, principal, groups, namely, sugars, oligosaccharides, and, polysaccharides, monosaccharides, are, the, simplest, carbohydrates, in, that, they, cannot, be, hydrolyzed, to, smaller, carbohydrates, they, are, aldehydes, or, ketones, with, two, or, more, hydroxyl, groups, the, general, chemical, formula, of, an, unmodified, monosaccharide, is, c, h, 2, o, n, literally, a, carbon, hydrate, monosaccharides, are, important, fuel, molecules, as, well, as, building, blocks, for, nucleic, acids, the, smallest, monosaccharides, for, which, n, 3, are, dihydroxyacetone, and, d, and, l, glyceraldehydes, the, and, anomers, of, glucose, note, the, position, of, the, hydroxyl, group, red, or, green, on, the, anomeric, carbon, relative, to, the, ch, 2, oh, group, bound, to, carbon, 5, they, either, have, identical, absolute, configurations, r, r, or, s, s, or, opposite, absolute, configurations, r, s, or, s, r, monosaccharides, are, classified, according, to, three, different, characteristics, the, placement, of, its, carbonyl, group, the, number, of, carbon, atoms, it, contains, and, its, chiral, handedness, if, the, carbonyl, group, is, an, aldehyde, the, monosaccharide, is, an, aldose, if, the, carbonyl, group, is, a, ketone, the, monosaccharide, is, a, ketose, monosaccharides, with, three, carbon, atoms, are, called, trioses, those, with, four, are, called, tetroses, five, are, called, pentoses, six, are, hexoses, and, so, on, these, two, systems, of, classification, are, often, combined, for, example, glucose, is, an, aldohexose, a, six, carbon, aldehyde, ribose, is, an, aldopentose, a, five, carbon, aldehyde, and, fructose, is, a, ketohexose, a, six, carbon, ketone, each, carbon, atom, bearing, a, hydroxyl, group, oh, with, the, exception, of, the, first, and, last, carbons, are, asymmetric, making, them, stereo, centers, with, two, possible, configurations, each, r, or, s, because, of, this, asymmetry, a, number, of, isomers, may, exist, for, any, given, monosaccharide, formula, using, le, bel, van, t, hoff, rule, the, aldohexose, d, glucose, for, example, has, the, formula, c, h, 2, o, 6, of, which, four, of, its, six, carbons, atoms, are, stereogenic, making, d, glucose, one, of, 2, 4, 16, possible, stereoisomers, in, the, case, of, glyceraldehydes, an, aldotriose, there, is, one, pair, of, possible, stereoisomers, which, are, enantiomers, and, epimers, 1, 3, dihydroxyacetone, the, ketose, corresponding, to, the, aldose, glyceraldehydes, is, a, symmetric, molecule, with, no, stereo, centers, the, assignment, of, d, or, l, is, made, according, to, the, orientation, of, the, asymmetric, carbon, furthest, from, the, carbonyl, group, in, a, standard, fischer, projection, if, the, hydroxyl, group, is, on, the, right, the, molecule, is, a, d, sugar, otherwise, it, is, an, l, sugar, the, d, and, l, prefixes, should, not, be, confused, with, d, or, l, which, indicate, the, direction, that, the, sugar, rotates, plane, polarized, light, this, usage, of, d, and, l, is, no, longer, followed, in, carbohydrate, chemistry, the, aldehyde, or, ketone, group, of, a, straight, chain, monosaccharide, will, react, reversibly, with, a, hydroxyl, group, on, a, different, carbon, atom, to, form, a, hemiacetal, or, hemiketal, forming, a, heterocyclic, ring, with, an, oxygen, bridge, between, two, carbon, atoms, rings, with, five, and, six, atoms, are, called, furanose, and, pyranose, forms, respectively, and, exist, in, equilibrium, with, the, straight, chain, form, during, the, conversion, from, straight, chain, form, to, the, cyclic, form, the, carbon, atom, containing, the, carbonyl, oxygen, called, the, anomeric, carbon, becomes, a, stereogenic, center, with, two, possible, configurations, the, oxygen, atom, may, take, a, position, either, above, or, below, the, plane, of, the, ring, the, resulting, possible, pair, of, stereoisomers, is, called, anomers, in, the, anomer, the, oh, substituent, on, the, anomeric, carbon, rests, on, the, opposite, side, trans, of, the, ring, from, the, ch, 2, oh, side, branch, the, alternative, form, in, which, the, ch, 2, oh, substituent, and, the, anomeric, hydroxyl, are, on, the, same, side, cis, of, the, plane, of, the, ring, is, called, the, anomer, monosaccharides, are, the, major, fuel, source, for, metabolism, being, used, both, as, an, energy, source, glucose, being, the, most, important, in, nature, as, it, is, the, product, of, photosynthesis, in, plants, and, in, biosynthesis, when, monosaccharides, are, not, immediately, needed, they, are, often, converted, to, more, space, efficient, i, e, less, water, soluble, forms, often, polysaccharides, in, many, animals, including, humans, this, storage, form, is, glycogen, especially, in, liver, and, muscle, cells, in, plants, starch, is, used, for, the, same, purpose, the, most, abundant, carbohydrate, cellulose, is, a, structural, component, of, the, cell, wall, of, plants, and, many, forms, of, algae, ribose, is, a, component, of, rna, deoxyribose, is, a, component, of, dna, lyxose, is, a, component, of, lyxoflavin, found, in, the, human, heart, ribulose, and, xylulose, occur, in, the, pentose, phosphate, pathway, galactose, a, component, of, milk, sugar, lactose, is, found, in, galactolipids, in, plant, cell, membranes, and, in, glycoproteins, in, many, tissues, mannose, occurs, in, human, metabolism, especially, in, the, glycosylation, of, certain, proteins, fructose, or, fruit, sugar, is, found, in, many, plants, and, humans, it, is, metabolized, in, the, liver, absorbed, directly, into, the, intestines, during, digestion, and, found, in, semen, trehalose, a, major, sugar, of, insects, is, rapidly, hydrolyzed, into, two, glucose, molecules, to, support, continuous, flight, two, joined, monosaccharides, are, called, a, disaccharide, the, simplest, kind, of, polysaccharide, examples, include, sucrose, and, lactose, they, are, composed, of, two, monosaccharide, units, bound, together, by, a, covalent, bond, known, as, a, glycosidic, linkage, formed, via, a, dehydration, reaction, resulting, in, the, loss, of, a, hydrogen, atom, from, one, monosaccharide, and, a, hydroxyl, group, from, the, other, the, formula, of, unmodified, disaccharides, is, c, 12, h, 22, o, 11, although, there, are, numerous, kinds, of, disaccharides, a, handful, of, disaccharides, are, particularly, notable, sucrose, pictured, to, the, right, is, the, most, abundant, disaccharide, and, the, main, form, in, which, carbohydrates, are, transported, in, plants, it, is, composed, of, one, d, glucose, molecule, and, one, d, fructose, molecule, the, systematic, name, for, sucrose, o, d, glucopyranosyl, 1, 2, d, fructofuranoside, indicates, four, things, lactose, a, disaccharide, composed, of, one, d, galactose, molecule, and, one, d, glucose, molecule, occurs, naturally, in, mammalian, milk, the, systematic, name, for, lactose, is, o, d, galactopyranosyl, 1, 4, d, glucopyranose, other, notable, disaccharides, include, maltose, two, d, glucoses, linked, 1, 4, and, cellobiose, two, d, glucoses, linked, 1, 4, disaccharides, can, be, classified, into, two, types, reducing, and, non, reducing, disaccharides, if, the, functional, group, is, present, in, bonding, with, another, sugar, unit, it, is, called, a, reducing, disaccharide, or, biose, oligosaccharides, are, saccharide, polymers, composed, of, three, to, ten, units, of, monosaccharides, connected, via, glycosidic, linkages, similar, to, disaccharides, they, are, usually, linked, to, lipids, or, amino, acids, glycosic, linkage, with, oxygen, or, nitrogen, to, form, glygolipids, and, glycoproteins, though, some, like, the, raffinose, series, and, the, fructooligosaccharides, do, not, they, have, roles, in, cell, recognition, and, cell, adhesion, carbohydrate, consumed, in, food, yields, 3, 87, kilocalories, of, energy, per, gram, for, simple, sugars, and, 3, 57, to, 4, 12, kilocalories, per, gram, for, complex, carbohydrate, in, most, other, foods, relatively, high, levels, of, carbohydrate, are, associated, with, processed, foods, or, refined, foods, made, from, plants, including, sweets, cookies, and, candy, table, sugar, honey, soft, drinks, breads, and, crackers, jams, and, fruit, products, pastas, and, breakfast, cereals, lower, amounts, of, digestible, carbohydrate, are, usually, associated, with, unrefined, foods, as, these, foods, have, more, fiber, including, beans, tubers, rice, and, unrefined, fruit, animal, based, foods, generally, have, the, lowest, carbohydrate, levels, although, milk, does, contain, a, high, proportion, of, lactose, organisms, typically, cannot, metabolize, all, types, of, carbohydrate, to, yield, energy, glucose, is, a, nearly, universal, and, accessible, source, of, energy, many, organisms, also, have, the, ability, to, metabolize, other, monosaccharides, and, disaccharides, but, glucose, is, often, metabolized, first, in, escherichia, coli, for, example, the, lac, operon, will, express, enzymes, for, the, digestion, of, lactose, when, it, is, present, but, if, both, lactose, and, glucose, are, present, the, lac, operon, is, repressed, resulting, in, the, glucose, being, used, first, see, diauxie, polysaccharides, are, also, common, sources, of, energy, many, organisms, can, easily, break, down, starches, into, glucose, most, organisms, however, cannot, metabolize, cellulose, or, other, polysaccharides, like, chitin, and, arabinoxylans, these, carbohydrate, types, can, be, metabolized, by, some, bacteria, and, protists, ruminants, and, termites, for, example, use, microorganisms, to, process, cellulose, even, though, these, complex, carbohydrates, are, not, very, digestible, they, represent, an, important, dietary, element, for, humans, called, dietary, fiber, fiber, enhances, digestion, among, other, benefits, the, institute, of, medicine, recommends, that, american, and, canadian, adults, get, between, 45, and, 65, of, dietary, energy, from, whole, grain, carbohydrates, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, and, world, health, organization, jointly, recommend, that, national, dietary, guidelines, set, a, goal, of, 55, 75, of, total, energy, from, carbohydrates, but, only, 10, directly, from, sugars, their, term, for, simple, carbohydrates, a, 2017, cochrane, systematic, review, concluded, that, there, was, insufficient, evidence, to, support, the, claim, that, whole, grain, diets, can, affect, cardiovascular, disease, nutritionists, often, refer, to, carbohydrates, as, either, simple, or, complex, however, the, exact, distinction, between, these, groups, can, be, ambiguous, the, term, complex, carbohydrate, was, first, used, in, the, u, s, senate, select, committee, on, nutrition, and, human, needs, publication, dietary, goals, for, the, united, states, 1977, where, it, was, intended, to, distinguish, sugars, from, other, carbohydrates, which, were, perceived, to, be, nutritionally, superior, however, the, report, put, fruit, vegetables, and, whole, grains, in, the, complex, carbohydrate, column, despite, the, fact, that, these, may, contain, sugars, as, well, as, polysaccharides, this, confusion, persists, as, today, some, nutritionists, use, the, term, complex, carbohydrate, to, refer, to, any, sort, of, digestible, saccharide, present, in, a, whole, food, where, fiber, vitamins, and, minerals, are, also, found, as, opposed, to, processed, carbohydrates, which, provide, energy, but, few, other, nutrients, the, standard, usage, however, is, to, classify, carbohydrates, chemically, simple, if, they, are, sugars, monosaccharides, and, disaccharides, and, complex, if, they, are, polysaccharides, or, oligosaccharides, in, any, case, the, simple, vs, complex, chemical, distinction, has, little, value, for, determining, the, nutritional, quality, of, carbohydrates, some, simple, carbohydrates, e, g, fructose, raise, blood, glucose, rapidly, while, some, complex, carbohydrates, starches, raise, blood, sugar, slowly, the, speed, of, digestion, is, determined, by, a, variety, of, factors, including, which, other, nutrients, are, consumed, with, the, carbohydrate, how, the, food, is, prepared, individual, differences, in, metabolism, and, the, chemistry, of, the, carbohydrate, carbohydrates, are, sometimes, divided, into, available, carbohydrates, which, are, absorbed, in, the, small, intestine, and, unavailable, carbohydrates, which, pass, to, the, large, intestine, where, they, are, subject, to, fermentation, by, the, gastrointestinal, microbiota, the, usda, s, dietary, guidelines, for, americans, 2010, call, for, moderate, to, high, carbohydrate, consumption, from, a, balanced, diet, that, includes, six, one, ounce, servings, of, grain, foods, each, day, at, least, half, from, whole, grain, sources, and, the, rest, are, from, enriched, the, glycemic, index, gi, and, glycemic, load, concepts, have, been, developed, to, characterize, food, behavior, during, human, digestion, they, rank, carbohydrate, rich, foods, based, on, the, rapidity, and, magnitude, of, their, effect, on, blood, glucose, levels, glycemic, index, is, a, measure, of, how, quickly, food, glucose, is, absorbed, while, glycemic, load, is, a, measure, of, the, total, absorbable, glucose, in, foods, the, insulin, index, is, a, similar, more, recent, classification, method, that, ranks, foods, based, on, their, effects, on, blood, insulin, levels, which, are, caused, by, glucose, or, starch, and, some, amino, acids, in, food, low, carbohydrate, diets, may, miss, the, health, advantages, such, as, increased, intake, of, dietary, fiber, afforded, by, high, quality, carbohydrates, found, in, legumes, and, pulses, whole, grains, fruits, and, vegetables, a, meta, analysis, of, moderate, quality, included, as, adverse, effects, of, the, diet, halitosis, headache, and, constipation, carbohydrate, restricted, diets, can, be, as, effective, as, low, fat, diets, in, helping, achieve, weight, loss, over, the, short, term, when, overall, calorie, intake, is, reduced, an, endocrine, society, scientific, statement, said, that, when, calorie, intake, is, held, constant, body, fat, accumulation, does, not, appear, to, be, affected, by, even, very, pronounced, changes, in, the, amount, of, fat, vs, carbohydrate, in, the, diet, in, the, long, term, effective, weight, loss, or, maintenance, depends, on, calorie, restriction, not, the, ratio, of, macronutrients, in, a, diet, the, reasoning, of, diet, advocates, that, carbohydrates, cause, undue, fat, accumulation, by, increasing, blood, insulin, levels, and, that, low, carbohydrate, diets, have, a, metabolic, advantage, is, not, supported, by, clinical, evidence, further, it, is, not, clear, how, low, carbohydrate, dieting, affects, cardiovascular, health, although, two, reviews, showed, that, carbohydrate, restriction, may, improve, lipid, markers, of, cardiovascular, disease, risk, carbohydrate, restricted, diets, are, no, more, effective, than, a, conventional, healthy, diet, in, preventing, the, onset, of, type, 2, diabetes, but, for, people, with, type, 2, diabetes, they, are, a, viable, option, for, losing, weight, or, helping, with, glycemic, control, there, is, limited, evidence, to, support, routine, use, of, low, carbohydrate, dieting, in, managing, type, 1, diabetes, the, american, diabetes, association, recommends, that, people, with, diabetes, should, adopt, a, generally, healthy, diet, rather, than, a, diet, focused, on, carbohydrate, or, other, macronutrients, an, extreme, form, of, low, carbohydrate, diet, the, ketogenic, diet, is, established, as, a, medical, diet, for, treating, epilepsy, through, celebrity, endorsement, during, the, early, 21st, century, it, became, a, fad, diet, as, a, means, of, weight, loss, but, with, risks, of, undesirable, side, effects, such, as, low, energy, levels, and, increased, hunger, insomnia, nausea, and, gastrointestinal, discomfort, the, british, dietetic, association, named, it, one, of, the, top, 5, worst, celeb, diets, to, avoid, in, 2018, most, dietary, carbohydrates, contain, glucose, either, as, their, only, building, block, as, in, the, polysaccharides, starch, and, glycogen, or, together, with, another, monosaccharide, as, in, the, hetero, polysaccharides, sucrose, and, lactose, unbound, glucose, is, one, of, the, main, ingredients, of, honey, glucose, is, extremely, abundant, and, has, been, isolated, from, a, variety, of, natural, sources, across, the, world, including, male, cones, of, the, coniferous, tree, wollemia, nobilis, in, rome, the, roots, of, ilex, asprella, plants, in, china, and, straws, from, rice, in, california, a, the, carbohydrate, value, is, calculated, in, the, usda, database, and, does, not, always, correspond, to, the, sum, of, the, sugars, the, starch, and, the, dietary, fiber, carbohydrate, metabolism, is, the, series, of, biochemical, processes, responsible, for, the, formation, breakdown, and, interconversion, of, carbohydrates, in, living, organisms, the, most, important, carbohydrate, is, glucose, a, simple, sugar, monosaccharide, that, is, metabolized, by, nearly, all, known, organisms, glucose, and, other, carbohydrates, are, part, of, a, wide, variety, of, metabolic, pathways, across, species, plants, synthesize, carbohydrates, from, carbon, dioxide, and, water, by, photosynthesis, storing, the, absorbed, energy, internally, often, in, the, form, of, starch, or, lipids, plant, components, are, consumed, by, animals, and, fungi, and, used, as, fuel, for, cellular, respiration, oxidation, of, one, gram, of, carbohydrate, yields, approximately, 16, kj, 4, kcal, of, energy, while, the, oxidation, of, one, gram, of, lipids, yields, about, 38, kj, 9, kcal, the, human, body, stores, between, 300, and, 500, g, of, carbohydrates, depending, on, body, weight, with, the, skeletal, muscle, contributing, to, a, large, portion, of, the, storage, energy, obtained, from, metabolism, e, g, oxidation, of, glucose, is, usually, stored, temporarily, within, cells, in, the, form, of, atp, organisms, capable, of, anaerobic, and, aerobic, respiration, metabolize, glucose, and, oxygen, aerobic, to, release, energy, with, carbon, dioxide, and, water, as, byproducts, catabolism, is, the, metabolic, reaction, which, cells, undergo, to, break, down, larger, molecules, extracting, energy, there, are, two, major, metabolic, pathways, of, monosaccharide, catabolism, glycolysis, and, the, citric, acid, cycle, in, glycolysis, oligo, and, polysaccharides, are, cleaved, first, to, smaller, monosaccharides, by, enzymes, called, glycoside, hydrolases, the, monosaccharide, units, can, then, enter, into, monosaccharide, catabolism, a, 2, atp, investment, is, required, in, the, early, steps, of, glycolysis, to, phosphorylate, glucose, to, glucose, 6, phosphate, g6p, and, fructose, 6, phosphate, f6p, to, fructose, 1, 6, biphosphate, fbp, thereby, pushing, the, reaction, forward, irreversibly, in, some, cases, as, with, humans, not, all, carbohydrate, types, are, usable, as, the, digestive, and, metabolic, enzymes, necessary, are, not, present, carbohydrate, chemistry, is, a, large, and, economically, important, branch, of, organic, chemistry, some, of, the, main, organic, reactions, that, involve, carbohydrates, are, carbohydrate, synthesis, is, a, sub, field, of, organic, chemistry, concerned, specifically, with, the, generation, of, natural, and, unnatural, carbohydrate, structures, this, can, include, the, synthesis, of, monosaccharide, residues, or, structures, containing, more, than, one, monosaccharide, known, as, oligosaccharides, selective, formation, of, glycosidic, linkages, and, selective, reactions, of, hydroxyl, groups, are, very, important, and, the, usage, of, protecting, groups, is, extensive, common, reactions, for, glycosidic, bond, formation, are, as, follows, while, some, common, protection, methods, are, as, below
