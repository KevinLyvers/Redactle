traditional, but, see, below, coccinellidae, k, k, s, n, l, d, i, is, a, widespread, family, of, small, beetles, they, are, commonly, known, as, ladybugs, in, north, america, and, ladybirds, in, the, united, kingdom, lady, refers, to, mother, mary, entomologists, use, the, names, ladybird, beetles, or, lady, beetles, to, avoid, confusion, with, true, bugs, the, more, than, 6, 000, described, species, have, a, global, distribution, and, are, found, in, a, variety, of, habitats, they, are, oval, beetles, with, a, domed, back, and, flat, underside, many, of, the, species, have, conspicuous, aposematic, warning, colours, and, patterns, such, as, red, with, black, spots, that, warn, potential, predators, that, they, taste, bad, most, coccinellid, species, are, carnivorous, predators, preying, on, insects, such, as, aphids, and, scale, insects, other, species, are, known, to, consume, non, animal, matter, including, plants, and, fungi, they, are, promiscuous, breeders, reproducing, in, spring, and, summer, in, temperate, regions, and, during, the, wet, season, in, tropical, regions, many, predatory, species, lay, their, eggs, near, colonies, of, prey, providing, their, larvae, with, a, food, source, like, most, insects, they, develop, from, larva, to, pupa, to, adult, temperate, species, hibernate, and, diapause, during, the, winter, tropical, species, are, dormant, during, the, dry, season, coccinellids, migrate, between, dormancy, and, breeding, sites, species, that, prey, on, agricultural, pests, are, considered, beneficial, insects, several, species, have, been, introduced, outside, their, range, as, biological, control, agents, with, varying, degrees, of, success, some, species, are, pests, themselves, and, attack, agricultural, crops, or, can, infest, people, s, homes, particularly, in, winter, invasive, species, like, harmonia, axyridis, can, pose, an, ecological, threat, to, native, coccinellid, species, other, threats, to, coccinellids, include, climate, change, and, habitat, destruction, these, insects, have, played, roles, in, folklore, religion, and, poetry, and, are, particularly, popular, in, nursery, rhymes, the, name, coccinellidae, created, by, pierre, andr, latreille, in, 1807, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, coccineus, meaning, scarlet, the, common, english, name, ladybird, originated, in, britain, where, the, insects, became, known, as, our, lady, s, birds, mary, our, lady, was, often, depicted, wearing, a, red, cloak, in, early, art, and, the, seven, spots, of, the, species, coccinella, septempunctata, the, most, common, in, europe, were, said, to, represent, her, seven, joys, and, seven, sorrows, in, the, united, states, the, name, was, popularly, adapted, to, ladybug, entomologists, prefer, the, names, ladybird, beetles, or, lady, beetles, to, avoid, confusion, with, true, bugs, names, in, some, other, countries, may, be, similar, for, example, in, germany, they, are, known, as, marienk, fer, meaning, marybeetle, or, ladybeetle, coccinellids, range, in, size, from, 0, 8, to, 18, mm, 0, 03, 0, 7, in, they, are, sexually, dimorphic, adult, females, tend, to, be, slightly, larger, than, males, they, are, generally, oval, with, domed, backs, and, flattened, undersides, they, have, large, compound, eyes, and, clubbed, antennae, with, seven, to, eleven, segments, the, powerful, mandibles, equivalent, to, jaws, typically, have, pairs, of, teeth, which, face, each, other, the, coccinellid, prothorax, front, of, thorax, is, broad, and, convex, and, can, cover, the, back, of, the, head, being, beetles, they, have, hardened, non, overlapping, forewings, known, as, elytra, which, cover, up, the, more, fragile, hindwings, when, the, insects, are, not, in, flight, their, legs, are, relatively, short, with, a, tarsal, formula, of, 4, 4, 4, or, 3, 3, 3, the, tarsus, end, of, leg, has, two, claws, at, the, tip, as, adults, these, beetles, differ, from, their, closest, relatives, with, the, following, morphological, characteristics, coccinellids, are, often, distinctively, coloured, and, patterned, the, elytron, may, be, light, with, dark, spots, or, dark, with, light, spots, light, areas, are, typically, yellow, red, orange, or, brown, and, the, spots, vary, in, size, and, shape, and, numbers, some, species, have, striped, or, checkered, patterns, the, pigment, carotene, creates, the, lighter, colours, and, melanins, create, darker, colours, other, parts, of, the, body, also, vary, in, colouration, these, colour, patterns, typically, serve, as, warning, colouration, but, some, can, act, as, camouflage, attract, mates, or, even, regulate, heat, several, individual, species, may, display, polymorphism, and, even, change, colour, between, seasons, coccinellid, larvae, are, elongated, with, square, heads, they, are, covered, in, hairs, or, setae, the, abdominal, segments, in, particular, each, having, six, divided, into, pairs, and, one, to, three, segmented, antennae, their, colouration, varies, from, grey, blue, grey, grey, brown, or, brown, and, spotted, with, white, yellow, red, or, orange, they, tend, to, brighten, as, they, get, closer, to, adulthood, over, 6, 000, living, species, of, coccinellidae, have, been, described, they, are, sparsely, preserved, in, the, fossil, record, although, molecular, clock, estimates, have, placed, their, origin, in, the, cretaceous, the, oldest, fossils, of, the, group, are, known, from, the, oise, amber, of, france, dating, to, the, early, eocene, ypresian, around, 53, million, years, ago, which, belong, to, the, extant, genera, rhyzobius, and, nephus, the, greatest, number, of, fossils, comes, from, the, younger, eocene, baltic, amber, including, members, of, the, extant, genera, serangium, and, rhyzobius, as, well, as, extinct, genera, belonging, to, the, tribes, microweiseini, baltosidis, and, sticholotidini, electrolotis, the, coccinellidae, are, within, the, superfamily, coccinelloidea, which, in, turn, is, part, of, the, infraorder, cucujiformia, a, group, containing, most, of, the, plant, eating, beetles, the, ladybirds, form, the, majority, of, the, species, in, the, coccinelloidea, many, of, the, rest, are, fungus, feeding, beetles, or, scavengers, lymexyloidea, tenebrionoidea, cleroidea, chrysomeloidea, curculionoidea, cucujoidea, bothrideridae, and, allies, latridiidae, akalyptoischiidae, alexiidae, corylophidae, and, allies, endomychidae, coccinellidae, coccinellidae, have, historically, been, divided, into, up, seven, subfamilies, chilocorinae, coccidulinae, coccinellinae, epilachninae, microweiseinae, scymninae, and, sticholotidinae, and, 35, tribes, based, on, morphology, however, genetics, studies, have, called, into, question, the, monophyly, single, ancestry, of, most, of, these, subfamilies, the, monophyly, of, coccinellinae, has, the, most, support, a, 2021, genetic, study, sampling, many, species, identified, three, subfamilies, microweiseinae, with, three, tribes, coccinellinae, 26, tribes, and, a, newly, identified, group, the, monocoryninae, one, tribe, all, three, subfamilies, were, strongly, supported, but, the, study, noted, that, although, the, tribes, are, mostly, monophyletic, their, relationships, are, only, weakly, supported, the, study, suggests, that, the, crown, group, appeared, some, 143, mya, in, the, early, cretaceous, and, that, the, group, diversified, rapidly, during, the, late, cretaceous, perhaps, because, the, growth, in, diversity, of, angiosperm, plants, then, encouraged, the, radiation, of, insects, of, the, clade, sternorrhyncha, such, as, aphids, on, which, ladybirds, could, feed, microweiseinae, monocoryninae, stethorini, coccinellini, other, tribes, an, earlier, 2009, study, concluded, that, consumption, of, scale, insects, is, the, most, basal, diet, of, coccinellidae, aphid, eating, evolved, three, separate, times, and, leaf, eating, evolved, twice, one, of, which, evolved, from, a, clade, that, contains, both, aphid, eating, and, pollen, eating, the, fungi, eating, also, evolved, from, aphid, eating, coccinellids, mostly, fly, during, the, day, springy, cylindrical, veins, in, the, hindwings, stiffen, when, in, flight, and, bend, when, folding, folding, of, the, wings, is, further, aided, by, creases, in, the, membrane, these, beetles, may, migrate, long, distances, to, hibernation, and, breeding, sites, and, areas, with, more, food, they, appear, to, be, drawn, to, recognisable, landmarks, the, more, crowded, an, area, is, the, more, individuals, leave, but, will, remain, if, there, are, enough, prey, species, to, feed, on, trivial, flights, refer, to, flying, while, foraging, or, when, finding, a, place, to, lay, eggs, one, study, of, species, in, britain, found, that, coccinellids, can, fly, as, far, as, 120, km, 75, mi, they, flew, at, speeds, of, 30, km, h, 19, mph, and, could, reach, altitudes, close, to, 1, 100, m, 3, 600, ft, in, temperate, climates, coccinellids, typically, breed, from, late, spring, to, early, summer, in, warmer, temperate, regions, reproduction, may, occur, in, spring, fall, and, winter, tropical, species, reproduce, during, the, wet, season, mating, is, promiscuous, in, some, species, females, appear, to, be, selective, in, their, partners, preferring, males, of, a, certain, size, and, colour, males, produce, sperm, packets, each, with, 14, 000, sperm, and, insert, three, of, them, into, the, female, even, though, she, can, only, hold, 18, 000, sperm, this, is, likely, a, form, of, sperm, competition, like, other, insects, coccinellids, develop, from, egg, to, larva, to, pupa, and, finally, adult, eggs, tend, to, be, bright, yellow, and, the, females, lay, them, close, together, standing, upright, and, near, where, they, can, access, food, the, number, of, eggs, in, a, cluster, can, vary, depending, on, the, species, it, is, typically, in, the, double, digits, but, some, species, can, lay, over, a, thousand, eggs, in, their, lifetime, after, hatching, the, larvae, will, begin, eating, including, the, other, eggs, in, their, clutch, certain, species, lay, extra, infertile, trophic, eggs, with, the, fertile, eggs, providing, a, backup, food, source, for, the, larvae, when, they, hatch, the, ratio, of, infertile, to, fertile, eggs, increases, with, scarcity, of, food, at, the, time, of, egg, laying, larvae, typically, have, four, instar, stages, with, three, moults, between, them, the, larva, eventually, transitions, into, a, pupa, which, involves, the, development, of, a, hunch, the, fusion, of, the, legs, to, the, body, and, the, attachment, of, the, posterior, to, the, surface, pupae, may, be, uncovered, partially, covered, or, fully, covered, by, larval, skin, depending, on, the, species, the, pupa, is, mostly, immobile, but, the, head, can, move, in, response, to, irritation, when, the, adult, emerges, it, has, its, hindwings, while, the, elytron, starts, out, softer, and, lighter, in, colour, with, no, patterns, the, length, of, each, development, stage, varies, based, on, climate, and, between, species, for, adalia, bipunctata, eggs, hatch, after, four, to, eight, days, the, larva, stage, lasts, around, three, weeks, and, the, pupa, lasts, seven, to, ten, days, adult, coccinellids, develop, much, of, their, final, colouration, within, hours, but, may, not, fully, darken, for, weeks, or, months, the, lifespan, of, an, adult, reaches, up, to, a, year, in, temperate, areas, coccinellids, may, hibernate, or, enter, diapause, during, the, winter, individuals, during, this, period, gather, in, clumps, large, or, small, depending, on, the, species, overwintering, insects, can, be, found, both, in, lowland, areas, aggregating, under, dead, vegetation, and, at, the, tops, of, hills, hibernating, under, rocks, and, on, grass, tussocks, in, areas, with, particularly, hot, summers, the, insects, experience, summer, dormancy, or, aestivation, in, the, tropics, coccinellids, enter, dormancy, during, the, dry, season, coccinellids, act, both, as, predators, prey, and, parasitic, hosts, in, food, webs, the, majority, of, coccinellids, are, carnivorous, and, predatory, typically, preying, on, sternorrhyncha, insects, like, aphids, scale, insects, whiteflies, psyllids, and, adelgids, some, species, feed, on, the, larvae, of, moths, and, other, beetles, as, well, as, mites, since, much, of, their, prey, are, agricultural, pests, coccinellids, are, considered, to, be, beneficial, insects, a, 2009, metastudy, by, hodek, and, hon, k, found, that, aphid, eaters, constituted, around, 68, percent, of, species, that, live, in, temperate, areas, but, only, 20, percent, of, species, worldwide, around, 36, percent, of, total, species, mostly, feed, on, scale, insects, larvae, and, adults, eat, the, same, foods, unlike, in, other, insect, groups, ladybird, species, vary, in, dietary, specificity, an, example, of, a, specialist, species, is, those, of, the, genus, stethorus, which, feed, on, spider, mites, aphid, eaters, tend, to, be, generalist, they, have, a, high, voracity, and, can, multiply, quickly, in, response, to, outbreaks, and, switch, to, other, prey, when, the, ephemeral, aphids, become, scarce, predators, of, scale, insects, tend, to, be, less, voracious, and, are, slower, breeders, and, developers, matching, their, prey, under, pressure, from, coccinellid, predation, aphid, species, have, evolved, to, become, more, toxic, forcing, coccinellids, to, develop, immunities, coccinellid, predators, of, aphids, need, to, defend, themselves, against, ants, that, tend, and, defend, aphids, for, their, honeydew, and, coccinellid, eggs, laid, near, aphids, are, disposed, of, some, species, including, coccinella, magnifica, and, diomus, have, adapted, to, grow, within, ant, nests, as, larvae, and, some, like, diomus, thoracicus, are, predators, of, the, brood, of, the, ant, wasmannia, auropunctata, cannibalism, has, been, recorded, in, several, species, which, includes, larvae, eating, eggs, or, other, larvae, and, adults, feeding, on, individuals, of, any, life, stage, some, coccinellids, are, mostly, non, predatory, such, as, some, species, in, the, genera, epilachna, and, henosepilachna, the, majority, of, predatory, species, may, also, supplement, their, diet, with, other, sources, of, food, both, in, their, larval, and, adult, stages, non, animal, matter, consumed, include, leaves, pollen, nectar, sap, fungi, and, honeydew, members, of, the, tribe, halyziini, of, the, subfamily, coccinellinae, are, obligate, fungus, feeders, coccinellids, of, any, lifestage, are, preyed, on, by, predators, such, as, birds, spiders, ants, and, lacewings, they, are, also, hosts, for, parasites, including, some, flies, ticks, mites, hymenopterans, and, nematodes, and, pathogens, including, bacteria, fungi, and, protozoa, wolbachia, bacteria, infects, eggs, and, kills, male, zygotes, the, promiscuity, of, coccinellids, has, led, to, their, being, affected, by, sexually, transmitted, infections, the, bright, warning, colouration, of, many, coccinellids, discourage, potential, predators, warning, of, their, toxicity, a, 2015, study, of, five, ladybird, species, found, that, their, colouration, honestly, signalled, their, toxicity, implying, the, warning, is, genuine, species, with, more, contrast, with, the, background, environment, tended, to, be, more, toxic, coccinellid, haemolymph, blood, contains, toxic, alkaloids, azamacrolides, and, polyamines, as, well, as, foul, smelling, pyrazines, coccinellids, can, produce, at, least, 50, types, of, alkaloids, when, disturbed, ladybirds, further, defend, themselves, with, reflex, bleeding, exuding, drops, from, their, tibio, femoral, knee, joints, effectively, presenting, predators, with, a, sample, of, their, toxic, and, bitter, body, fluid, predator, deterring, poisons, are, particularly, important, for, the, immobile, pupa, access, to, food, can, affect, the, concentration, of, both, pigments, and, toxins, the, similarity, of, coccinellid, patterning, in, red, and, orange, with, black, markings, has, led, to, suggestions, that, they, and, some, species, of, chrysomelids, form, m, llerian, mimicry, rings, particularly, to, defend, them, from, birds, despite, their, chemical, defenses, coccinellids, are, preyed, on, by, some, clerid, beetles, in, the, genus, enoclerus, several, species, of, which, are, brightly, coloured, in, red, and, black, and, which, possibly, sequester, the, toxins, of, the, prey, to, defend, themselves, against, other, predators, as, an, anti, predator, defense, spiders, of, the, genus, eresus, known, as, ladybird, spiders, have, evolved, to, replicate, the, patterns, of, coccinellids, this, is, a, form, of, batesian, mimicry, as, the, spiders, lack, the, chemicals, this, resemblance, is, limited, to, adult, male, spiders, which, are, actively, searching, for, females, and, exposed, unlike, the, females, and, young, which, remain, sheltered, in, burrows, coccinellidae, are, found, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, asian, and, african, species, are, less, studied, than, others, coccinellids, can, be, found, in, a, variety, of, habitats, both, on, the, ground, and, in, the, trees, they, may, specialise, using, certain, plants, some, species, can, live, in, extreme, environments, such, as, high, mountains, arid, deserts, and, cold, regions, several, of, the, most, famous, species, have, wide, ranges, but, others, are, more, endemic, and, possibly, threatened, threats, to, coccinellids, include, climate, change, agriculture, urbanisation, and, invasive, species, coccinellid, biodiversity, will, likely, be, affected, by, the, rising, of, both, average, temperatures, and, heat, fluctuations, climate, change, may, lead, to, smaller, larvae, as, well, as, increase, energy, and, metabolic, needs, and, interspecific, predation, agriculture, and, urbanisation, threatens, these, insects, though, habitat, destruction, and, homogenisation, and, the, use, of, pesticides, invasive, threats, include, other, coccinellids, particularly, c, septempunctata, in, north, america, and, h, axyridis, globally, these, invaders, outcompete, the, native, species, as, well, as, eat, their, eggs, as, of, 2022, the, iucn, red, list, does, not, list, the, conservation, status, for, any, coccinellid, though, there, is, an, iucn, ssc, ladybird, specialist, group, conservationists, have, suggested, several, measures, for, protecting, the, insects, including, citizen, science, and, education, programs, habitat, preservation, and, restoration, prevention, of, the, spread, of, invasive, species, and, a, global, monitoring, program, coccinellids, have, been, valued, in, biological, pest, control, as, they, prey, on, agricultural, pests, such, as, aphids, and, scale, insects, their, importance, in, controlling, pests, was, noted, as, far, back, as, 1814, in, england, their, efficiency, can, vary, sometimes, they, have, a, relatively, small, effect, on, aphid, populations, at, others, they, cause, significant, seasonal, declines, several, species, have, been, introduced, to, areas, outside, their, native, range, the, first, being, the, vedalia, beetle, novius, cardinalis, the, larva, of, the, species, was, introduced, to, california, in, 1887, from, australia, to, protect, citrus, trees, from, cottony, cushion, scale, the, project, was, markedly, successful, costing, 1, 500, in, 1889, making, it, a, textbook, example, of, the, great, potential, of, classical, biological, control, as, a, tactic, for, suppressing, invasive, pests, the, beetle, was, then, used, in, 29, countries, again, with, success, reasons, for, this, include, its, high, prey, specificity, fast, development, multiple, generations, each, year, efficient, discovery, of, host, patches, and, larval, development, completed, on, a, single, host, insect, there, have, been, many, further, attempts, to, use, ladybird, species, against, pests, with, varying, degrees, of, success, scale, insect, eating, coccinellids, have, been, more, successfully, used, than, aphid, predators, out, of, 155, deliberate, introductions, meant, to, control, aphids, by, the, year, 2000, only, one, was, deemed, to, be, substantially, successful, this, is, due, to, aphid, eating, species, being, fast, breeding, generalist, and, voracious, and, thus, difficult, to, control, coccinellids, can, also, act, as, pests, harmonia, axyridis, is, native, to, east, asia, but, has, been, introduced, to, the, americas, europe, and, africa, in, north, america, this, species, begins, to, appear, indoors, in, the, autumn, when, they, leave, their, summer, feeding, sites, to, search, out, places, to, stay, for, winter, typically, when, temperatures, warm, to, the, mid, 60s, f, around, 18, c, in, the, late, afternoon, they, swarm, onto, or, into, buildings, illuminated, by, the, sun, from, nearby, fields, and, forests, after, an, abnormally, long, period, of, hot, dry, weather, in, the, summer, of, 1976, in, the, uk, a, marked, increase, in, the, aphid, population, was, followed, by, a, plague, of, the, native, coccinella, septempunctata, there, were, many, reports, of, people, being, bitten, as, the, supply, of, aphids, dwindled, h, axyridis, c, septempunctata, and, hippodamia, convergens, are, the, most, common, causes, of, ladybird, taint, in, wine, as, few, as, 1, 3, to, 1, 5, coccinellids, per, 1, kilogram, 2, 2, lb, of, grapes, can, affect, wine, quality, when, they, are, present, during, the, wine, making, process, the, mexican, bean, beetle, is, an, agricultural, pest, as, it, primarily, feeds, on, plants, especially, legumes, instead, of, insects, coccinellids, have, had, important, roles, in, culture, and, religion, being, associated, with, luck, love, fertility, and, prophecy, ladybird, is, an, affectionate, term, for, someone, such, as, a, loved, one, in, european, folklore, an, insect, acts, as, a, matchmaker, crawling, on, a, woman, and, then, flying, to, their, true, love, coccinellids, have, been, said, to, predict, the, future, particularly, weather, conditions, and, how, well, the, crops, will, grow, in, christianity, coccinellids, have, been, seen, as, the, literal, gatekeepers, of, heaven, a, swedish, name, for, the, insects, himmelska, nycla, means, keys, of, heaven, jews, have, referred, to, the, insects, as, the, cow, of, moses, our, teacher, the, cherokee, have, revered, them, as, the, great, beloved, woman, this, was, used, as, a, title, for, the, highest, ranking, woman, in, the, government, who, would, be, painted, in, the, colours, and, patterns, of, the, insect, during, ceremonies, coccinellids, have, been, popularly, featured, in, poems, and, nursery, rhymes, the, most, famous, being, ladybird, ladybird, this, has, come, in, several, forms, including, ladybird, ladybird, fly, away, home, thy, house, is, on, fire, thy, children, all, roam, except, little, nan, who, sits, on, her, pan, weaving, gold, laces, as, fast, as, she, can
