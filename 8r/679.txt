16, see, text, sunbirds, and, spiderhunters, make, up, the, family, nectariniidae, of, passerine, birds, they, are, small, slender, passerines, from, the, old, world, usually, with, downward, curved, bills, many, are, brightly, coloured, often, with, iridescent, feathers, particularly, in, the, males, many, species, also, have, especially, long, tail, feathers, their, range, extends, through, most, of, africa, to, the, middle, east, south, asia, south, east, asia, and, southern, china, to, indonesia, new, guinea, and, northern, australia, species, diversity, is, highest, in, equatorial, regions, there, are, 151, species, in, 16, genera, their, family, name, is, from, most, sunbirds, feeding, largely, on, nectar, but, they, will, also, catch, insects, and, spiders, especially, when, feeding, their, young, flowers, that, prevent, access, to, their, nectar, because, of, their, shape, for, example, very, long, and, narrow, flowers, are, simply, punctured, at, the, base, near, the, nectaries, from, which, the, birds, sip, the, nectar, fruit, is, also, part, of, the, diet, of, some, species, their, flight, is, fast, and, direct, thanks, to, their, short, wings, the, sunbirds, have, counterparts, in, two, very, distantly, related, groups, the, hummingbirds, of, the, americas, and, the, honeyeaters, of, australia, the, resemblances, are, due, to, convergent, evolution, brought, about, by, a, similar, nectar, feeding, lifestyle, some, sunbird, species, can, take, nectar, by, hovering, like, a, hummingbird, but, they, usually, perch, to, feed, the, family, ranges, in, size, from, the, 5, gram, black, bellied, sunbird, to, the, spectacled, spiderhunter, at, about, 45, grams, like, the, hummingbirds, sunbirds, are, strongly, sexually, dimorphic, with, the, males, usually, brilliantly, plumaged, in, iridescent, colours, in, addition, to, this, the, tails, of, many, species, are, longer, in, the, males, and, overall, the, males, are, larger, sunbirds, have, long, thin, down, curved, bills, and, brush, tipped, tubular, tongues, both, adaptations, to, their, nectar, feeding, the, spiderhunters, of, the, genus, arachnothera, are, distinct, in, appearance, from, the, other, members, of, the, family, they, are, typically, larger, than, the, other, sunbirds, with, drab, brown, plumage, that, is, the, same, for, both, sexes, and, long, down, curved, beaks, in, metabolic, behaviour, similar, to, that, of, andes, hummingbirds, species, of, sunbirds, that, live, at, high, altitudes, or, latitudes, will, enter, torpor, while, roosting, at, night, lowering, their, body, temperature, and, entering, a, state, of, low, activity, and, responsiveness, the, moulting, regimes, of, sunbirds, are, complex, being, different, in, different, species, many, species, have, no, eclipse, plumage, but, do, have, juvenile, plumage, some, species, do, show, duller, plumage, in, the, off, season, in, the, dry, months, of, june, august, male, copper, sunbirds, and, variable, sunbirds, lose, much, of, their, metallic, sheen, in, some, instances, different, populations, of, the, same, species, can, display, variation, in, different, molting, regimes, sunbirds, are, a, tropical, old, world, family, with, representatives, in, africa, asia, and, australasia, in, africa, they, are, found, mostly, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, madagascar, but, are, also, distributed, in, egypt, in, asia, the, group, occurs, along, the, coasts, of, the, red, sea, as, far, north, as, israel, and, along, the, mediterranean, as, far, north, as, beirut, with, a, gap, in, their, distribution, across, inland, syria, and, iraq, and, resuming, in, iran, from, where, the, group, occurs, continuously, as, far, as, southern, china, and, indonesia, in, australasia, the, family, occurs, in, new, guinea, north, eastern, australia, and, the, solomon, islands, they, are, generally, not, found, on, oceanic, islands, with, the, exception, of, the, seychelles, the, greatest, variety, of, species, is, found, in, africa, where, the, group, probably, arose, most, species, are, sedentary, or, short, distance, seasonal, migrants, sunbirds, occur, over, the, entire, family, s, range, whereas, the, spiderhunters, are, restricted, to, asia, the, sunbirds, and, spiderhunters, occupy, a, wide, range, of, habitats, with, a, majority, of, species, being, found, in, primary, rainforest, but, other, habitats, used, by, the, family, including, disturbed, secondary, forest, open, woodland, open, scrub, and, savannah, coastal, scrub, and, alpine, forest, some, species, have, readily, adapted, to, human, modified, landscapes, such, as, plantations, gardens, and, agricultural, land, many, species, are, able, to, occupy, a, wide, range, of, habitats, from, sea, level, to, 4900, m, sunbird, are, active, diurnal, birds, that, generally, occur, in, pairs, or, occasionally, in, small, family, groups, a, few, species, occasionally, gather, in, larger, groups, and, sunbird, will, join, with, other, birds, to, mob, potential, predators, although, sunbirds, will, also, aggressively, target, other, species, even, if, they, are, not, predators, when, defending, their, territories, sunbirds, that, breed, outside, of, the, equatorial, regions, are, mostly, seasonal, breeders, with, the, majority, of, them, breeding, in, the, wet, season, this, timing, reflects, the, increased, availability, of, insect, prey, for, the, growing, young, where, species, like, the, buff, throated, sunbird, breed, in, the, dry, season, it, is, thought, to, be, associated, with, the, flowering, of, favoured, food, plants, species, of, sunbird, in, the, equatorial, areas, breed, throughout, the, year, they, are, generally, monogamous, and, often, territorial, although, a, few, species, of, sunbirds, have, lekking, behaviour, the, nests, of, sunbirds, are, generally, purse, shaped, enclosed, suspended, from, thin, branches, with, generous, use, of, spiderweb, the, nests, of, the, spiderhunters, are, different, both, from, the, sunbirds, and, in, some, cases, from, each, other, some, like, the, little, spiderhunter, are, small, woven, cups, attached, to, the, underside, of, large, leaves, that, of, the, yellow, eared, spiderhunter, is, similarly, attached, but, is, a, long, tube, the, nests, of, spiderhunters, are, inconspicuous, in, contrast, to, those, of, the, other, sunbirds, which, are, more, visible, in, most, species, the, female, alone, constructs, the, nest, up, to, four, eggs, are, laid, the, female, builds, the, nest, and, incubates, the, eggs, alone, although, the, male, assists, in, rearing, the, nestlings, in, the, spiderhunters, both, sexes, help, to, incubate, the, eggs, the, nests, of, sunbirds, and, spiderhunters, are, often, targeted, by, brood, parasites, such, as, cuckoos, and, honeyguides, as, nectar, is, a, primary, food, source, for, sunbirds, they, are, important, pollinators, in, african, ecosystems, sunbird, pollinated, flowers, are, typically, long, tubular, and, red, to, orange, in, colour, showing, convergent, evolution, with, many, hummingbird, pollinated, flowers, in, the, americas, a, key, difference, is, that, sunbirds, cannot, hover, so, sunbird, pollinated, flowers, and, inflorescences, are, typically, sturdier, than, hummingbird, pollinated, flowers, with, an, appropriate, landing, spot, from, which, the, bird, can, feed, sunbirds, are, critical, pollinators, for, many, iconic, african, plants, including, proteas, aloes, erica, erythrina, coral, trees, and, bird, of, paradise, flowers, specialization, on, sunbirds, vs, other, pollinators, is, thought, to, have, contributed, to, plant, speciation, including, the, exceptionally, high, floral, diversity, in, southern, africa, overall, the, family, has, fared, better, than, many, others, with, only, seven, species, considered, to, be, threatened, with, extinction, most, species, are, fairly, resistant, to, changes, in, habitat, and, while, attractive, the, family, is, not, sought, after, by, the, cagebird, trade, as, they, have, what, is, considered, an, unpleasant, song, and, are, tricky, to, keep, alive, sunbirds, are, considered, attractive, birds, and, readily, enter, gardens, where, flowering, plants, are, planted, to, attract, them, there, are, a, few, negative, interactions, for, example, the, scarlet, chested, sunbird, is, considered, a, pest, in, cocoa, plantations, as, it, spreads, parasitic, mistletoes, the, family, contains, 151, species, divided, into, 16, genera, for, more,
