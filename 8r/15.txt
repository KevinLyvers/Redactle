in, biology, epigenetics, is, the, study, of, heritable, traits, or, a, stable, change, of, cell, function, that, happen, without, changes, to, the, dna, sequence, the, greek, prefix, epi, over, outside, of, around, in, epigenetics, implies, features, that, are, on, top, of, or, in, addition, to, the, traditional, dna, sequence, based, genetic, mechanism, of, inheritance, epigenetics, usually, involves, a, change, that, is, not, erased, by, cell, division, and, affects, the, regulation, of, gene, expression, such, effects, on, cellular, and, physiological, phenotypic, traits, may, result, from, environmental, factors, or, be, part, of, normal, development, epigenetic, factors, can, also, lead, to, cancer, the, term, also, refers, to, the, mechanism, of, changes, functionally, relevant, alterations, to, the, genome, that, do, not, involve, mutation, of, the, nucleotide, sequence, examples, of, mechanisms, that, produce, such, changes, are, dna, methylation, and, histone, modification, each, of, which, alters, how, genes, are, expressed, without, altering, the, underlying, dna, sequence, further, non, coding, rna, sequences, have, been, shown, to, play, a, key, role, in, the, regulation, of, gene, expression, gene, expression, can, be, controlled, through, the, action, of, repressor, proteins, that, attach, to, silencer, regions, of, the, dna, these, epigenetic, changes, may, last, through, cell, divisions, for, the, duration, of, the, cell, s, life, and, may, also, last, for, multiple, generations, even, though, they, do, not, involve, changes, in, the, underlying, dna, sequence, of, the, organism, instead, non, genetic, factors, cause, the, organism, s, genes, to, behave, or, express, themselves, differently, one, example, of, an, epigenetic, change, in, eukaryotic, biology, is, the, process, of, cellular, differentiation, during, morphogenesis, totipotent, stem, cells, become, the, various, pluripotent, cell, lines, of, the, embryo, which, in, turn, become, fully, differentiated, cells, in, other, words, as, a, single, fertilized, egg, cell, the, zygote, continues, to, divide, the, resulting, daughter, cells, change, into, all, the, different, cell, types, in, an, organism, including, neurons, muscle, cells, epithelium, endothelium, of, blood, vessels, etc, by, activating, some, genes, while, inhibiting, the, expression, of, others, the, term, epigenesis, has, a, generic, meaning, of, extra, growth, that, has, been, used, in, english, since, the, 17th, century, in, scientific, publications, the, term, epigenetics, started, to, appear, in, the, 1930s, see, fig, on, the, right, however, its, contemporary, meaning, emerged, only, in, the, 1990s, a, definition, of, the, concept, of, epigenetic, trait, as, a, stably, heritable, phenotype, resulting, from, changes, in, a, chromosome, without, alterations, in, the, dna, sequence, was, formulated, at, a, cold, spring, harbor, meeting, in, 2008, although, alternate, definitions, that, include, non, heritable, traits, are, still, being, used, widely, the, hypothesis, of, epigenetic, changes, affecting, the, expression, of, chromosomes, was, put, forth, by, the, russian, biologist, nikolai, koltsov, from, the, generic, meaning, and, the, associated, adjective, epigenetic, british, embryologist, c, h, waddington, coined, the, term, epigenetics, in, 1942, as, pertaining, to, epigenesis, in, parallel, to, valentin, haecker, s, phenogenetics, ph, nogenetik, epigenesis, in, the, context, of, the, biology, of, that, period, referred, to, the, differentiation, of, cells, from, their, initial, totipotent, state, during, embryonic, development, when, waddington, coined, the, term, the, physical, nature, of, genes, and, their, role, in, heredity, was, not, known, he, used, it, instead, as, a, conceptual, model, of, how, genetic, components, might, interact, with, their, surroundings, to, produce, a, phenotype, he, used, the, phrase, epigenetic, landscape, as, a, metaphor, for, biological, development, waddington, held, that, cell, fates, were, established, during, development, in, a, process, he, called, canalisation, much, as, a, marble, rolls, down, to, the, point, of, lowest, local, elevation, waddington, suggested, visualising, increasing, irreversibility, of, cell, type, differentiation, as, ridges, rising, between, the, valleys, where, the, marbles, analogous, to, cells, are, travelling, in, recent, times, waddington, s, notion, of, the, epigenetic, landscape, has, been, rigorously, formalized, in, the, context, of, the, systems, dynamics, state, approach, to, the, study, of, cell, fate, cell, fate, determination, is, predicted, to, exhibit, certain, dynamics, such, as, attractor, convergence, the, attractor, can, be, an, equilibrium, point, limit, cycle, or, strange, attractor, or, oscillatory, robin, holliday, defined, in, 1990, epigenetics, as, the, study, of, the, mechanisms, of, temporal, and, spatial, control, of, gene, activity, during, the, development, of, complex, organisms, more, recent, usage, of, the, word, in, biology, follows, stricter, definitions, as, defined, by, arthur, riggs, and, colleagues, it, is, the, study, of, mitotically, and, or, meiotically, heritable, changes, in, gene, function, that, cannot, be, explained, by, changes, in, dna, sequence, the, term, has, also, been, used, however, to, describe, processes, which, have, not, been, demonstrated, to, be, heritable, such, as, some, forms, of, histone, modification, consequently, there, are, attempts, to, redefine, epigenetics, in, broader, terms, that, would, avoid, the, constraints, of, requiring, heritability, for, example, adrian, bird, defined, epigenetics, as, the, structural, adaptation, of, chromosomal, regions, so, as, to, register, signal, or, perpetuate, altered, activity, states, this, definition, would, be, inclusive, of, transient, modifications, associated, with, dna, repair, or, cell, cycle, phases, as, well, as, stable, changes, maintained, across, multiple, cell, generations, but, exclude, others, such, as, templating, of, membrane, architecture, and, prions, unless, they, impinge, on, chromosome, function, such, redefinitions, however, are, not, universally, accepted, and, are, still, subject, to, debate, the, nih, roadmap, epigenomics, project, which, ran, from, 2008, to, 2017, uses, the, following, definition, for, purposes, of, this, program, epigenetics, refers, to, both, heritable, changes, in, gene, activity, and, expression, in, the, progeny, of, cells, or, of, individuals, and, also, stable, long, term, alterations, in, the, transcriptional, potential, of, a, cell, that, are, not, necessarily, heritable, in, 2008, a, consensus, definition, of, the, epigenetic, trait, a, stably, heritable, phenotype, resulting, from, changes, in, a, chromosome, without, alterations, in, the, dna, sequence, was, made, at, a, cold, spring, harbor, meeting, the, similarity, of, the, word, to, genetics, has, generated, many, parallel, usages, the, epigenome, is, a, parallel, to, the, word, genome, referring, to, the, overall, epigenetic, state, of, a, cell, and, epigenomics, refers, to, global, analyses, of, epigenetic, changes, across, the, entire, genome, the, phrase, genetic, code, has, also, been, adapted, the, epigenetic, code, has, been, used, to, describe, the, set, of, epigenetic, features, that, create, different, phenotypes, in, different, cells, from, the, same, underlying, dna, sequence, taken, to, its, extreme, the, epigenetic, code, could, represent, the, total, state, of, the, cell, with, the, position, of, each, molecule, accounted, for, in, an, epigenomic, map, a, diagrammatic, representation, of, the, gene, expression, dna, methylation, and, histone, modification, status, of, a, particular, genomic, region, more, typically, the, term, is, used, in, reference, to, systematic, efforts, to, measure, specific, relevant, forms, of, epigenetic, information, such, as, the, histone, code, or, dna, methylation, patterns, covalent, modification, of, either, dna, e, g, cytosine, methylation, and, hydroxymethylation, or, of, histone, proteins, e, g, lysine, acetylation, lysine, and, arginine, methylation, serine, and, threonine, phosphorylation, and, lysine, ubiquitination, and, sumoylation, play, central, roles, in, many, types, of, epigenetic, inheritance, therefore, the, word, epigenetics, is, sometimes, used, as, a, synonym, for, these, processes, however, this, can, be, misleading, chromatin, remodeling, is, not, always, inherited, and, not, all, epigenetic, inheritance, involves, chromatin, remodeling, in, 2019, a, further, lysine, modification, appeared, in, the, scientific, literature, linking, epigenetics, modification, to, cell, metabolism, i, e, lactylation, because, the, phenotype, of, a, cell, or, individual, is, affected, by, which, of, its, genes, are, transcribed, heritable, transcription, states, can, give, rise, to, epigenetic, effects, there, are, several, layers, of, regulation, of, gene, expression, one, way, that, genes, are, regulated, is, through, the, remodeling, of, chromatin, chromatin, is, the, complex, of, dna, and, the, histone, proteins, with, which, it, associates, if, the, way, that, dna, is, wrapped, around, the, histones, changes, gene, expression, can, change, as, well, chromatin, remodeling, is, accomplished, through, two, main, mechanisms, there, is, frequently, a, reciprocal, relationship, between, dna, methylation, and, histone, lysine, methylation, for, instance, the, methyl, binding, domain, protein, mbd1, attracted, to, and, associating, with, methylated, cytosine, in, a, dna, cpg, site, can, also, associate, with, h3k9, methyltransferase, activity, to, methylate, histone, 3, at, lysine, 9, on, the, other, hand, dna, maintenance, methylation, by, dnmt1, appears, to, partly, rely, on, recognition, of, histone, methylation, on, the, nucleosome, present, at, the, dna, site, to, carry, out, cytosine, methylation, on, newly, synthesized, dna, there, is, further, crosstalk, between, dna, methylation, carried, out, by, dnmt3a, and, dnmt3b, and, histone, methylation, so, that, there, is, a, correlation, between, the, genome, wide, distribution, of, dna, methylation, and, histone, methylation, mechanisms, of, heritability, of, histone, state, are, not, well, understood, however, much, is, known, about, the, mechanism, of, heritability, of, dna, methylation, state, during, cell, division, and, differentiation, heritability, of, methylation, state, depends, on, certain, enzymes, such, as, dnmt1, that, have, a, higher, affinity, for, 5, methylcytosine, than, for, cytosine, if, this, enzyme, reaches, a, hemimethylated, portion, of, dna, where, 5, methylcytosine, is, in, only, one, of, the, two, dna, strands, the, enzyme, will, methylate, the, other, half, however, it, is, now, known, that, dnmt1, physically, interacts, with, the, protein, uhrf1, uhrf1, has, been, recently, recognized, as, essential, for, dnmt1, mediated, maintenance, of, dna, methylation, uhrf1, is, the, protein, that, specifically, recognizes, hemi, methylated, dna, therefore, bringing, dnmt1, to, its, substrate, to, maintain, dna, methylation, although, histone, modifications, occur, throughout, the, entire, sequence, the, unstructured, n, termini, of, histones, called, histone, tails, are, particularly, highly, modified, these, modifications, include, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, ribosylation, and, citrullination, acetylation, is, the, most, highly, studied, of, these, modifications, for, example, acetylation, of, the, k14, and, k9, lysines, of, the, tail, of, histone, h3, by, histone, acetyltransferase, enzymes, hats, is, generally, related, to, transcriptional, competence, see, figure, one, mode, of, thinking, is, that, this, tendency, of, acetylation, to, be, associated, with, active, transcription, is, biophysical, in, nature, because, it, normally, has, a, positively, charged, nitrogen, at, its, end, lysine, can, bind, the, negatively, charged, phosphates, of, the, dna, backbone, the, acetylation, event, converts, the, positively, charged, amine, group, on, the, side, chain, into, a, neutral, amide, linkage, this, removes, the, positive, charge, thus, loosening, the, dna, from, the, histone, when, this, occurs, complexes, like, swi, snf, and, other, transcriptional, factors, can, bind, to, the, dna, and, allow, transcription, to, occur, this, is, the, cis, model, of, the, epigenetic, function, in, other, words, changes, to, the, histone, tails, have, a, direct, effect, on, the, dna, itself, another, model, of, epigenetic, function, is, the, trans, model, in, this, model, changes, to, the, histone, tails, act, indirectly, on, the, dna, for, example, lysine, acetylation, may, create, a, binding, site, for, chromatin, modifying, enzymes, or, transcription, machinery, as, well, this, chromatin, remodeler, can, then, cause, changes, to, the, state, of, the, chromatin, indeed, a, bromodomain, a, protein, domain, that, specifically, binds, acetyl, lysine, is, found, in, many, enzymes, that, help, activate, transcription, including, the, swi, snf, complex, it, may, be, that, acetylation, acts, in, this, and, the, previous, way, to, aid, in, transcriptional, activation, the, idea, that, modifications, act, as, docking, modules, for, related, factors, is, borne, out, by, histone, methylation, as, well, methylation, of, lysine, 9, of, histone, h3, has, long, been, associated, with, constitutively, transcriptionally, silent, chromatin, constitutive, heterochromatin, see, bottom, figure, it, has, been, determined, that, a, chromodomain, a, domain, that, specifically, binds, methyl, lysine, in, the, transcriptionally, repressive, protein, hp1, recruits, hp1, to, k9, methylated, regions, one, example, that, seems, to, refute, this, biophysical, model, for, methylation, is, that, tri, methylation, of, histone, h3, at, lysine, 4, is, strongly, associated, with, and, required, for, full, transcriptional, activation, see, top, figure, tri, methylation, in, this, case, would, introduce, a, fixed, positive, charge, on, the, tail, it, has, been, shown, that, the, histone, lysine, methyltransferase, kmt, is, responsible, for, this, methylation, activity, in, the, pattern, of, histones, h3, h4, this, enzyme, utilizes, a, catalytically, active, site, called, the, set, domain, suppressor, of, variegation, enhancer, of, zeste, trithorax, the, set, domain, is, a, 130, amino, acid, sequence, involved, in, modulating, gene, activities, this, domain, has, been, demonstrated, to, bind, to, the, histone, tail, and, causes, the, methylation, of, the, histone, differing, histone, modifications, are, likely, to, function, in, differing, ways, acetylation, at, one, position, is, likely, to, function, differently, from, acetylation, at, another, position, also, multiple, modifications, may, occur, at, the, same, time, and, these, modifications, may, work, together, to, change, the, behavior, of, the, nucleosome, the, idea, that, multiple, dynamic, modifications, regulate, gene, transcription, in, a, systematic, and, reproducible, way, is, called, the, histone, code, although, the, idea, that, histone, state, can, be, read, linearly, as, a, digital, information, carrier, has, been, largely, debunked, one, of, the, best, understood, systems, that, orchestrate, chromatin, based, silencing, is, the, sir, protein, based, silencing, of, the, yeast, hidden, mating, type, loci, hml, and, hmr, dna, methylation, frequently, occurs, in, repeated, sequences, and, helps, to, suppress, the, expression, and, mobility, of, transposable, elements, because, 5, methylcytosine, can, be, spontaneously, deaminated, replacing, nitrogen, by, oxygen, to, thymidine, cpg, sites, are, frequently, mutated, and, become, rare, in, the, genome, except, at, cpg, islands, where, they, remain, unmethylated, epigenetic, changes, of, this, type, thus, have, the, potential, to, direct, increased, frequencies, of, permanent, genetic, mutation, dna, methylation, patterns, are, known, to, be, established, and, modified, in, response, to, environmental, factors, by, a, complex, interplay, of, at, least, three, independent, dna, methyltransferases, dnmt1, dnmt3a, and, dnmt3b, the, loss, of, any, of, which, is, lethal, in, mice, dnmt1, is, the, most, abundant, methyltransferase, in, somatic, cells, localizes, to, replication, foci, has, a, 10, 40, fold, preference, for, hemimethylated, dna, and, interacts, with, the, proliferating, cell, nuclear, antigen, pcna, by, preferentially, modifying, hemimethylated, dna, dnmt1, transfers, patterns, of, methylation, to, a, newly, synthesized, strand, after, dna, replication, and, therefore, is, often, referred, to, as, the, maintenance, methyltransferase, dnmt1, is, essential, for, proper, embryonic, development, imprinting, and, x, inactivation, to, emphasize, the, difference, of, this, molecular, mechanism, of, inheritance, from, the, canonical, watson, crick, base, pairing, mechanism, of, transmission, of, genetic, information, the, term, epigenetic, templating, was, introduced, furthermore, in, addition, to, the, maintenance, and, transmission, of, methylated, dna, states, the, same, principle, could, work, in, the, maintenance, and, transmission, of, histone, modifications, and, even, cytoplasmic, structural, heritable, states, rna, methylation, of, n6, methyladenosine, m6a, as, the, most, abundant, eukaryotic, rna, modification, has, recently, been, recognized, as, an, important, gene, regulatory, mechanism, histones, h3, and, h4, can, also, be, manipulated, through, demethylation, using, histone, lysine, demethylase, kdm, this, recently, identified, enzyme, has, a, catalytically, active, site, called, the, jumonji, domain, jmjc, the, demethylation, occurs, when, jmjc, utilizes, multiple, cofactors, to, hydroxylate, the, methyl, group, thereby, removing, it, jmjc, is, capable, of, demethylating, mono, di, and, tri, methylated, substrates, chromosomal, regions, can, adopt, stable, and, heritable, alternative, states, resulting, in, bistable, gene, expression, without, changes, to, the, dna, sequence, epigenetic, control, is, often, associated, with, alternative, covalent, modifications, of, histones, the, stability, and, heritability, of, states, of, larger, chromosomal, regions, are, suggested, to, involve, positive, feedback, where, modified, nucleosomes, recruit, enzymes, that, similarly, modify, nearby, nucleosomes, a, simplified, stochastic, model, for, this, type, of, epigenetics, is, found, here, it, has, been, suggested, that, chromatin, based, transcriptional, regulation, could, be, mediated, by, the, effect, of, small, rnas, small, interfering, rnas, can, modulate, transcriptional, gene, expression, via, epigenetic, modulation, of, targeted, promoters, sometimes, a, gene, after, being, turned, on, transcribes, a, product, that, directly, or, indirectly, maintains, the, activity, of, that, gene, for, example, hnf4, and, myod, enhance, the, transcription, of, many, liver, specific, and, muscle, specific, genes, respectively, including, their, own, through, the, transcription, factor, activity, of, the, proteins, they, encode, rna, signalling, includes, differential, recruitment, of, a, hierarchy, of, generic, chromatin, modifying, complexes, and, dna, methyltransferases, to, specific, loci, by, rnas, during, differentiation, and, development, other, epigenetic, changes, are, mediated, by, the, production, of, different, splice, forms, of, rna, or, by, formation, of, double, stranded, rna, rnai, descendants, of, the, cell, in, which, the, gene, was, turned, on, will, inherit, this, activity, even, if, the, original, stimulus, for, gene, activation, is, no, longer, present, these, genes, are, often, turned, on, or, off, by, signal, transduction, although, in, some, systems, where, syncytia, or, gap, junctions, are, important, rna, may, spread, directly, to, other, cells, or, nuclei, by, diffusion, a, large, amount, of, rna, and, protein, is, contributed, to, the, zygote, by, the, mother, during, oogenesis, or, via, nurse, cells, resulting, in, maternal, effect, phenotypes, a, smaller, quantity, of, sperm, rna, is, transmitted, from, the, father, but, there, is, recent, evidence, that, this, epigenetic, information, can, lead, to, visible, changes, in, several, generations, of, offspring, micrornas, mirnas, are, members, of, non, coding, rnas, that, range, in, size, from, 17, to, 25, nucleotides, mirnas, regulate, a, large, variety, of, biological, functions, in, plants, and, animals, so, far, in, 2013, about, 2000, mirnas, have, been, discovered, in, humans, and, these, can, be, found, online, in, a, mirna, database, each, mirna, expressed, in, a, cell, may, target, about, 100, to, 200, messenger, rnas, mrnas, that, it, downregulates, most, of, the, downregulation, of, mrnas, occurs, by, causing, the, decay, of, the, targeted, mrna, while, some, downregulation, occurs, at, the, level, of, translation, into, protein, it, appears, that, about, 60, of, human, protein, coding, genes, are, regulated, by, mirnas, many, mirnas, are, epigenetically, regulated, about, 50, of, mirna, genes, are, associated, with, cpg, islands, that, may, be, repressed, by, epigenetic, methylation, transcription, from, methylated, cpg, islands, is, strongly, and, heritably, repressed, other, mirnas, are, epigenetically, regulated, by, either, histone, modifications, or, by, combined, dna, methylation, and, histone, modification, in, 2011, it, was, demonstrated, that, the, methylation, of, mrna, plays, a, critical, role, in, human, energy, homeostasis, the, obesity, associated, fto, gene, is, shown, to, be, able, to, demethylate, n6, methyladenosine, in, rna, srnas, are, small, 50, 250, nucleotides, highly, structured, non, coding, rna, fragments, found, in, bacteria, they, control, gene, expression, including, virulence, genes, in, pathogens, and, are, viewed, as, new, targets, in, the, fight, against, drug, resistant, bacteria, they, play, an, important, role, in, many, biological, processes, binding, to, mrna, and, protein, targets, in, prokaryotes, their, phylogenetic, analyses, for, example, through, srna, mrna, target, interactions, or, protein, binding, properties, are, used, to, build, comprehensive, databases, srna, gene, maps, based, on, their, targets, in, microbial, genomes, are, also, constructed, numerous, investigations, have, demonstrated, the, pivotal, involvement, of, long, non, coding, rnas, lncrnas, in, the, regulation, of, gene, expression, and, chromosomal, modifications, thereby, exerting, significant, control, over, cellular, differentiation, these, long, non, coding, rnas, also, contribute, to, genomic, imprinting, and, the, inactivation, of, the, x, chromosome, in, invertebrates, such, as, social, insects, of, honey, bees, long, non, coding, rnas, are, detected, as, a, possible, epigenetic, mechanism, via, allele, specific, genes, underlying, aggression, via, reciprocal, crosses, prions, are, infectious, forms, of, proteins, in, general, proteins, fold, into, discrete, units, that, perform, distinct, cellular, functions, but, some, proteins, are, also, capable, of, forming, an, infectious, conformational, state, known, as, a, prion, although, often, viewed, in, the, context, of, infectious, disease, prions, are, more, loosely, defined, by, their, ability, to, catalytically, convert, other, native, state, versions, of, the, same, protein, to, an, infectious, conformational, state, it, is, in, this, latter, sense, that, they, can, be, viewed, as, epigenetic, agents, capable, of, inducing, a, phenotypic, change, without, a, modification, of, the, genome, fungal, prions, are, considered, by, some, to, be, epigenetic, because, the, infectious, phenotype, caused, by, the, prion, can, be, inherited, without, modification, of, the, genome, psi, and, ure3, discovered, in, yeast, in, 1965, and, 1971, are, the, two, best, studied, of, this, type, of, prion, prions, can, have, a, phenotypic, effect, through, the, sequestration, of, protein, in, aggregates, thereby, reducing, that, protein, s, activity, in, psi, cells, the, loss, of, the, sup35, protein, which, is, involved, in, termination, of, translation, causes, ribosomes, to, have, a, higher, rate, of, read, through, of, stop, codons, an, effect, that, results, in, suppression, of, nonsense, mutations, in, other, genes, the, ability, of, sup35, to, form, prions, may, be, a, conserved, trait, it, could, confer, an, adaptive, advantage, by, giving, cells, the, ability, to, switch, into, a, psi, state, and, express, dormant, genetic, features, normally, terminated, by, stop, codon, mutations, prion, based, epigenetics, has, also, been, observed, in, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, epigenetic, changes, modify, the, activation, of, certain, genes, but, not, the, genetic, code, sequence, of, dna, the, microstructure, not, code, of, dna, itself, or, the, associated, chromatin, proteins, may, be, modified, causing, activation, or, silencing, this, mechanism, enables, differentiated, cells, in, a, multicellular, organism, to, express, only, the, genes, that, are, necessary, for, their, own, activity, epigenetic, changes, are, preserved, when, cells, divide, most, epigenetic, changes, only, occur, within, the, course, of, one, individual, organism, s, lifetime, however, these, epigenetic, changes, can, be, transmitted, to, the, organism, s, offspring, through, a, process, called, transgenerational, epigenetic, inheritance, moreover, if, gene, inactivation, occurs, in, a, sperm, or, egg, cell, that, results, in, fertilization, this, epigenetic, modification, may, also, be, transferred, to, the, next, generation, specific, epigenetic, processes, include, paramutation, bookmarking, imprinting, gene, silencing, x, chromosome, inactivation, position, effect, dna, methylation, reprogramming, transvection, maternal, effects, the, progress, of, carcinogenesis, many, effects, of, teratogens, regulation, of, histone, modifications, and, heterochromatin, and, technical, limitations, affecting, parthenogenesis, and, cloning, dna, damage, can, also, cause, epigenetic, changes, dna, damage, is, very, frequent, occurring, on, average, about, 60, 000, times, a, day, per, cell, of, the, human, body, see, dna, damage, naturally, occurring, these, damages, are, largely, repaired, however, epigenetic, changes, can, still, remain, at, the, site, of, dna, repair, in, particular, a, double, strand, break, in, dna, can, initiate, unprogrammed, epigenetic, gene, silencing, both, by, causing, dna, methylation, as, well, as, by, promoting, silencing, types, of, histone, modifications, chromatin, remodeling, see, next, section, in, addition, the, enzyme, parp1, poly, adp, ribose, polymerase, and, its, product, poly, adp, ribose, par, accumulate, at, sites, of, dna, damage, as, part, of, the, repair, process, this, accumulation, in, turn, directs, recruitment, and, activation, of, the, chromatin, remodeling, protein, alc1, that, can, cause, nucleosome, remodeling, nucleosome, remodeling, has, been, found, to, cause, for, instance, epigenetic, silencing, of, dna, repair, gene, mlh1, dna, damaging, chemicals, such, as, benzene, hydroquinone, styrene, carbon, tetrachloride, and, trichloroethylene, cause, considerable, hypomethylation, of, dna, some, through, the, activation, of, oxidative, stress, pathways, foods, are, known, to, alter, the, epigenetics, of, rats, on, different, diets, some, food, components, epigenetically, increase, the, levels, of, dna, repair, enzymes, such, as, mgmt, and, mlh1, and, p53, other, food, components, can, reduce, dna, damage, such, as, soy, isoflavones, in, one, study, markers, for, oxidative, stress, such, as, modified, nucleotides, that, can, result, from, dna, damage, were, decreased, by, a, 3, week, diet, supplemented, with, soy, a, decrease, in, oxidative, dna, damage, was, also, observed, 2, h, after, consumption, of, anthocyanin, rich, bilberry, vaccinium, myrtillius, l, pomace, extract, damage, to, dna, is, very, common, and, is, constantly, being, repaired, epigenetic, alterations, can, accompany, dna, repair, of, oxidative, damage, or, double, strand, breaks, in, human, cells, oxidative, dna, damage, occurs, about, 10, 000, times, a, day, and, dna, double, strand, breaks, occur, about, 10, to, 50, times, a, cell, cycle, in, somatic, replicating, cells, see, dna, damage, naturally, occurring, the, selective, advantage, of, dna, repair, is, to, allow, the, cell, to, survive, in, the, face, of, dna, damage, the, selective, advantage, of, epigenetic, alterations, that, occur, with, dna, repair, is, not, clear, in, the, steady, state, with, endogenous, damages, occurring, and, being, repaired, there, are, about, 2, 400, oxidatively, damaged, guanines, that, form, 8, oxo, 2, deoxyguanosine, 8, ohdg, in, the, average, mammalian, cell, dna, 8, ohdg, constitutes, about, 5, of, the, oxidative, damages, commonly, present, in, dna, the, oxidized, guanines, do, not, occur, randomly, among, all, guanines, in, dna, there, is, a, sequence, preference, for, the, guanine, at, a, methylated, cpg, site, a, cytosine, followed, by, guanine, along, its, 5, 3, direction, and, where, the, cytosine, is, methylated, 5, mcpg, a, 5, mcpg, site, has, the, lowest, ionization, potential, for, guanine, oxidation, oxidized, guanine, has, mispairing, potential, and, is, mutagenic, oxoguanine, glycosylase, ogg1, is, the, primary, enzyme, responsible, for, the, excision, of, the, oxidized, guanine, during, dna, repair, ogg1, finds, and, binds, to, an, 8, ohdg, within, a, few, seconds, however, ogg1, does, not, immediately, excise, 8, ohdg, in, hela, cells, half, maximum, removal, of, 8, ohdg, occurs, in, 30, minutes, and, in, irradiated, mice, the, 8, ohdgs, induced, in, the, mouse, liver, are, removed, with, a, half, life, of, 11, minutes, when, ogg1, is, present, at, an, oxidized, guanine, within, a, methylated, cpg, site, it, recruits, tet1, to, the, 8, ohdg, lesion, see, figure, this, allows, tet1, to, demethylate, an, adjacent, methylated, cytosine, demethylation, of, cytosine, is, an, epigenetic, alteration, as, an, example, when, human, mammary, epithelial, cells, were, treated, with, h, 2, o, 2, for, six, hours, 8, ohdg, increased, about, 3, 5, fold, in, dna, and, this, caused, about, 80, demethylation, of, the, 5, methylcytosines, in, the, genome, demethylation, of, cpgs, in, a, gene, promoter, by, tet, enzyme, activity, increases, transcription, of, the, gene, into, messenger, rna, in, cells, treated, with, h, 2, o, 2, one, particular, gene, was, examined, bace1, the, methylation, level, of, the, bace1, cpg, island, was, reduced, an, epigenetic, alteration, and, this, allowed, about, 6, 5, fold, increase, of, expression, of, bace1, messenger, rna, while, six, hour, incubation, with, h, 2, o, 2, causes, considerable, demethylation, of, 5, mcpg, sites, shorter, times, of, h, 2, o, 2, incubation, appear, to, promote, other, epigenetic, alterations, treatment, of, cells, with, h, 2, o, 2, for, 30, minutes, causes, the, mismatch, repair, protein, heterodimer, msh2, msh6, to, recruit, dna, methyltransferase, 1, dnmt1, to, sites, of, some, kinds, of, oxidative, dna, damage, this, could, cause, increased, methylation, of, cytosines, epigenetic, alterations, at, these, locations, jiang, et, al, treated, hek, 293, cells, with, agents, causing, oxidative, dna, damage, potassium, bromate, kbro3, or, potassium, chromate, k2cro4, base, excision, repair, ber, of, oxidative, damage, occurred, with, the, dna, repair, enzyme, polymerase, beta, localizing, to, oxidized, guanines, polymerase, beta, is, the, main, human, polymerase, in, short, patch, ber, of, oxidative, dna, damage, jiang, et, al, also, found, that, polymerase, beta, recruited, the, dna, methyltransferase, protein, dnmt3b, to, ber, repair, sites, they, then, evaluated, the, methylation, pattern, at, the, single, nucleotide, level, in, a, small, region, of, dna, including, the, promoter, region, and, the, early, transcription, region, of, the, brca1, gene, oxidative, dna, damage, from, bromate, modulated, the, dna, methylation, pattern, caused, epigenetic, alterations, at, cpg, sites, within, the, region, of, dna, studied, in, untreated, cells, cpgs, located, at, 189, 134, 29, 19, 16, and, 19, of, the, brca1, gene, had, methylated, cytosines, where, numbering, is, from, the, messenger, rna, transcription, start, site, and, negative, numbers, indicate, nucleotides, in, the, upstream, promoter, region, bromate, treatment, induced, oxidation, resulted, in, the, loss, of, cytosine, methylation, at, 189, 134, 16, and, 19, while, also, leading, to, the, formation, of, new, methylation, at, the, cpgs, located, at, 80, 55, 21, and, 8, after, dna, repair, was, allowed, at, least, four, articles, report, the, recruitment, of, dna, methyltransferase, 1, dnmt1, to, sites, of, dna, double, strand, breaks, during, homologous, recombinational, repair, hr, of, the, double, strand, break, the, involvement, of, dnmt1, causes, the, two, repaired, strands, of, dna, to, have, different, levels, of, methylated, cytosines, one, strand, becomes, frequently, methylated, at, about, 21, cpg, sites, downstream, of, the, repaired, double, strand, break, the, other, dna, strand, loses, methylation, at, about, six, cpg, sites, that, were, previously, methylated, downstream, of, the, double, strand, break, as, well, as, losing, methylation, at, about, five, cpg, sites, that, were, previously, methylated, upstream, of, the, double, strand, break, when, the, chromosome, is, replicated, this, gives, rise, to, one, daughter, chromosome, that, is, heavily, methylated, downstream, of, the, previous, break, site, and, one, that, is, unmethylated, in, the, region, both, upstream, and, downstream, of, the, previous, break, site, with, respect, to, the, gene, that, was, broken, by, the, double, strand, break, half, of, the, progeny, cells, express, that, gene, at, a, high, level, and, in, the, other, half, of, the, progeny, cells, expression, of, that, gene, is, repressed, when, clones, of, these, cells, were, maintained, for, three, years, the, new, methylation, patterns, were, maintained, over, that, time, period, in, mice, with, a, crispr, mediated, homology, directed, recombination, insertion, in, their, genome, there, were, a, large, number, of, increased, methylations, of, cpg, sites, within, the, double, strand, break, associated, insertion, non, homologous, end, joining, nhej, repair, of, a, double, strand, break, can, cause, a, small, number, of, demethylations, of, pre, existing, cytosine, dna, methylations, downstream, of, the, repaired, double, strand, break, further, work, by, allen, et, al, showed, that, nhej, of, a, dna, double, strand, break, in, a, cell, could, give, rise, to, some, progeny, cells, having, repressed, expression, of, the, gene, harboring, the, initial, double, strand, break, and, some, progeny, having, high, expression, of, that, gene, due, to, epigenetic, alterations, associated, with, nhej, repair, the, frequency, of, epigenetic, alterations, causing, repression, of, a, gene, after, an, nhej, repair, of, a, dna, double, strand, break, in, that, gene, may, be, about, 0, 9, epigenetic, research, uses, a, wide, range, of, molecular, biological, techniques, to, further, understanding, of, epigenetic, phenomena, these, techniques, include, chromatin, immunoprecipitation, together, with, its, large, scale, variants, chip, on, chip, and, chip, seq, fluorescent, in, situ, hybridization, methylation, sensitive, restriction, enzymes, dna, adenine, methyltransferase, identification, damid, and, bisulfite, sequencing, furthermore, the, use, of, bioinformatics, methods, has, a, role, in, computational, epigenetics, chromatin, immunoprecipitation, chip, has, helped, bridge, the, gap, between, dna, and, epigenetic, interactions, with, the, use, of, chip, researchers, are, able, to, make, findings, in, regards, to, gene, regulation, transcription, mechanisms, and, chromatin, structure, fluorescent, in, situ, hybridization, fish, is, very, important, to, understand, epigenetic, mechanisms, fish, can, be, used, to, find, the, location, of, genes, on, chromosomes, as, well, as, finding, noncoding, rnas, fish, is, predominantly, used, for, detecting, chromosomal, abnormalities, in, humans, methylation, sensitive, restriction, enzymes, paired, with, pcr, is, a, way, to, evaluate, methylation, in, dna, specifically, the, cpg, sites, if, dna, is, methylated, the, restriction, enzymes, will, not, cleave, the, strand, contrarily, if, the, dna, is, not, methylated, the, enzymes, will, cleave, the, strand, and, it, will, be, amplified, by, pcr, bisulfite, sequencing, is, another, way, to, evaluate, dna, methylation, cytosine, will, be, changed, to, uracil, from, being, treated, with, sodium, bisulfite, whereas, methylated, cytosines, will, not, be, affected, certain, sequencing, methods, such, as, nanopore, sequencing, allow, sequencing, of, native, dna, native, unamplified, dna, retains, the, epigenetic, modifications, which, would, otherwise, be, lost, during, the, amplification, step, nanopore, basecaller, models, can, distinguish, between, the, signals, obtained, for, epigenetically, modified, bases, and, unaltered, based, and, provide, an, epigenetic, profile, in, addition, to, the, sequencing, result, in, ciliates, such, as, tetrahymena, and, paramecium, genetically, identical, cells, show, heritable, differences, in, the, patterns, of, ciliary, rows, on, their, cell, surface, experimentally, altered, patterns, can, be, transmitted, to, daughter, cells, it, seems, existing, structures, act, as, templates, for, new, structures, the, mechanisms, of, such, inheritance, are, unclear, but, reasons, exist, to, assume, that, multicellular, organisms, also, use, existing, cell, structures, to, assemble, new, ones, eukaryotic, genomes, have, numerous, nucleosomes, nucleosome, position, is, not, random, and, determine, the, accessibility, of, dna, to, regulatory, proteins, promoters, active, in, different, tissues, have, been, shown, to, have, different, nucleosome, positioning, features, this, determines, differences, in, gene, expression, and, cell, differentiation, it, has, been, shown, that, at, least, some, nucleosomes, are, retained, in, sperm, cells, where, most, but, not, all, histones, are, replaced, by, protamines, thus, nucleosome, positioning, is, to, some, degree, inheritable, recent, studies, have, uncovered, connections, between, nucleosome, positioning, and, other, epigenetic, factors, such, as, dna, methylation, and, hydroxymethylation, different, histone, variants, are, incorporated, into, specific, regions, of, the, genome, non, randomly, their, differential, biochemical, characteristics, can, affect, genome, functions, via, their, roles, in, gene, regulation, and, maintenance, of, chromosome, structures, the, three, dimensional, configuration, of, the, genome, the, 3d, genome, is, complex, dynamic, and, crucial, for, regulating, genomic, function, and, nuclear, processes, such, as, dna, replication, transcription, and, dna, damage, repair, memory, formation, and, maintenance, are, due, to, epigenetic, alterations, that, cause, the, required, dynamic, changes, in, gene, transcription, that, create, and, renew, memory, in, neurons, an, event, can, set, off, a, chain, of, reactions, that, result, in, altered, methylations, of, a, large, set, of, genes, in, neurons, which, give, a, representation, of, the, event, a, memory, areas, of, the, brain, important, in, the, formation, of, memories, include, the, hippocampus, medial, prefrontal, cortex, mpfc, anterior, cingulate, cortex, and, amygdala, as, shown, in, the, diagram, of, the, human, brain, in, this, section, when, a, strong, memory, is, created, as, in, a, rat, subjected, to, contextual, fear, conditioning, cfc, one, of, the, earliest, events, to, occur, is, that, more, than, 100, dna, double, strand, breaks, are, formed, by, topoisomerase, iib, in, neurons, of, the, hippocampus, and, the, medial, prefrontal, cortex, mpfc, these, double, strand, breaks, are, at, specific, locations, that, allow, activation, of, transcription, of, immediate, early, genes, iegs, that, are, important, in, memory, formation, allowing, their, expression, in, mrna, with, peak, mrna, transcription, at, seven, to, ten, minutes, after, cfc, two, important, iegs, in, memory, formation, are, egr1, and, the, alternative, promoter, variant, of, dnmt3a, dnmt3a2, egr1, protein, binds, to, dna, at, its, binding, motifs, 5, gcgtgggcg, 3, or, 5, gcgggggcgg, 3, and, there, are, about, 12, 000, genome, locations, at, which, egr1, protein, can, bind, egr1, protein, binds, to, dna, in, gene, promoter, and, enhancer, regions, egr1, recruits, the, demethylating, enzyme, tet1, to, an, association, and, brings, tet1, to, about, 600, locations, on, the, genome, where, tet1, can, then, demethylate, and, activate, the, associated, genes, the, dna, methyltransferases, dnmt3a1, dnmt3a2, and, dnmt3b, can, all, methylate, cytosines, see, image, this, section, at, cpg, sites, in, or, near, the, promoters, of, genes, as, shown, by, manzo, et, al, these, three, dna, methyltransferases, differ, in, their, genomic, binding, locations, and, dna, methylation, activity, at, different, regulatory, sites, manzo, et, al, located, 3, 970, genome, regions, exclusively, enriched, for, dnmt3a1, 3, 838, regions, for, dnmt3a2, and, 3, 432, regions, for, dnmt3b, when, dnmt3a2, is, newly, induced, as, an, ieg, when, neurons, are, activated, many, new, cytosine, methylations, occur, presumably, in, the, target, regions, of, dnmt3a2, oliviera, et, al, found, that, the, neuronal, activity, inducible, ieg, levels, of, dnmt3a2, in, the, hippocampus, determined, the, ability, to, form, long, term, memories, rats, form, long, term, associative, memories, after, contextual, fear, conditioning, cfc, duke, et, al, found, that, 24, hours, after, cfc, in, rats, in, hippocampus, neurons, 2, 097, genes, 9, 17, of, the, genes, in, the, rat, genome, had, altered, methylation, when, newly, methylated, cytosines, are, present, in, cpg, sites, in, the, promoter, regions, of, genes, the, genes, are, often, repressed, and, when, newly, demethylated, cytosines, are, present, the, genes, may, be, activated, after, cfc, there, were, 1, 048, genes, with, reduced, mrna, expression, and, 564, genes, with, upregulated, mrna, expression, similarly, when, mice, undergo, cfc, one, hour, later, in, the, hippocampus, region, of, the, mouse, brain, there, are, 675, demethylated, genes, and, 613, hypermethylated, genes, however, memories, do, not, remain, in, the, hippocampus, but, after, four, or, five, weeks, the, memories, are, stored, in, the, anterior, cingulate, cortex, in, the, studies, on, mice, after, cfc, halder, et, al, showed, that, four, weeks, after, cfc, there, were, at, least, 1, 000, differentially, methylated, genes, and, more, than, 1, 000, differentially, expressed, genes, in, the, anterior, cingulate, cortex, while, at, the, same, time, the, altered, methylations, in, the, hippocampus, were, reversed, the, epigenetic, alteration, of, methylation, after, a, new, memory, is, established, creates, a, different, pool, of, nuclear, mrnas, as, reviewed, by, bernstein, the, epigenetically, determined, new, mix, of, nuclear, mrnas, are, often, packaged, into, neuronal, granules, or, messenger, rnp, consisting, of, mrna, small, and, large, ribosomal, subunits, translation, initiation, factors, and, rna, binding, proteins, that, regulate, mrna, function, these, neuronal, granules, are, transported, from, the, neuron, nucleus, and, are, directed, according, to, 3, untranslated, regions, of, the, mrna, in, the, granules, their, zip, codes, to, neuronal, dendrites, roughly, 2, 500, mrnas, may, be, localized, to, the, dendrites, of, hippocampal, pyramidal, neurons, and, perhaps, 450, transcripts, are, in, excitatory, presynaptic, nerve, terminals, dendritic, spines, the, altered, assortments, of, transcripts, dependent, on, epigenetic, alterations, in, the, neuron, nucleus, have, different, sensitivities, in, response, to, signals, which, is, the, basis, of, altered, synaptic, plasticity, altered, synaptic, plasticity, is, often, considered, the, neurochemical, foundation, of, learning, and, memory, epigenetics, play, a, major, role, in, brain, aging, and, age, related, cognitive, decline, with, relevance, to, life, extension, in, adulthood, changes, in, the, epigenome, are, important, for, various, higher, cognitive, functions, dysregulation, of, epigenetic, mechanisms, is, implicated, in, neurodegenerative, disorders, and, diseases, epigenetic, modifications, in, neurons, are, dynamic, and, reversible, epigenetic, regulation, impacts, neuronal, action, affecting, learning, memory,

with, the, epigenome, to, protect, or, boost, cognitive, processes, across, the, lifespan, a, review, suggests, neurobiological, effects, of, physical, exercise, via, epigenetics, seem, central, to, building, an, epigenetic, memory, to, influence, long, term, brain, function, and, behavior, and, may, even, be, heritable, with, the, axo, ciliary, synapse, there, is, communication, between, serotonergic, axons, and, antenna, like, primary, cilia, of, ca1, pyramidal, neurons, that, alters, the, neuron, s, epigenetic, state, in, the, nucleus, via, the, signalling, distinct, from, that, at, the, plasma, membrane, and, longer, term, epigenetics, also, play, a, major, role, in, the, brain, evolution, in, and, to, humans, developmental, epigenetics, can, be, divided, into, predetermined, and, probabilistic, epigenesis, predetermined, epigenesis, is, a, unidirectional, movement, from, structural, development, in, dna, to, the, functional, maturation, of, the, protein, predetermined, here, means, that, development, is, scripted, and, predictable, probabilistic, epigenesis, on, the, other, hand, is, a, bidirectional, structure, function, development, with, experiences, and, external, molding, development, somatic, epigenetic, inheritance, particularly, through, dna, and, histone, covalent, modifications, and, nucleosome, repositioning, is, very, important, in, the, development, of, multicellular, eukaryotic, organisms, the, genome, sequence, is, static, with, some, notable, exceptions, but, cells, differentiate, into, many, different, types, which, perform, different, functions, and, respond, differently, to, the, environment, and, intercellular, signaling, thus, as, individuals, develop, morphogens, activate, or, silence, genes, in, an, epigenetically, heritable, fashion, giving, cells, a, memory, in, mammals, most, cells, terminally, differentiate, with, only, stem, cells, retaining, the, ability, to, differentiate, into, several, cell, types, totipotency, and, multipotency, in, mammals, some, stem, cells, continue, producing, newly, differentiated, cells, throughout, life, such, as, in, neurogenesis, but, mammals, are, not, able, to, respond, to, loss, of, some, tissues, for, example, the, inability, to, regenerate, limbs, which, some, other, animals, are, capable, of, epigenetic, modifications, regulate, the, transition, from, neural, stem, cells, to, glial, progenitor, cells, for, example, differentiation, into, oligodendrocytes, is, regulated, by, the, deacetylation, and, methylation, of, histones, unlike, animals, plant, cells, do, not, terminally, differentiate, remaining, totipotent, with, the, ability, to, give, rise, to, a, new, individual, plant, while, plants, do, utilize, many, of, the, same, epigenetic, mechanisms, as, animals, such, as, chromatin, remodeling, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, some, kinds, of, plant, cells, do, not, use, or, require, cellular, memories, resetting, their, gene, expression, patterns, using, positional, information, from, the, environment, and, surrounding, cells, to, determine, their, fate, epigenetic, changes, can, occur, in, response, to, environmental, exposure, for, example, maternal, dietary, supplementation, with, genistein, 250, mg, kg, have, epigenetic, changes, affecting, expression, of, the, agouti, gene, which, affects, their, fur, color, weight, and, propensity, to, develop, cancer, ongoing, research, is, focused, on, exploring, the, impact, of, other, known, teratogens, such, as, diabetic, embryopathy, on, methylation, signatures, controversial, results, from, one, study, suggested, that, traumatic, experiences, might, produce, an, epigenetic, signal, that, is, capable, of, being, passed, to, future, generations, mice, were, trained, using, foot, shocks, to, fear, a, cherry, blossom, odor, the, investigators, reported, that, the, mouse, offspring, had, an, increased, aversion, to, this, specific, odor, they, suggested, epigenetic, changes, that, increase, gene, expression, rather, than, in, dna, itself, in, a, gene, m71, that, governs, the, functioning, of, an, odor, receptor, in, the, nose, that, responds, specifically, to, this, cherry, blossom, smell, there, were, physical, changes, that, correlated, with, olfactory, smell, function, in, the, brains, of, the, trained, mice, and, their, descendants, several, criticisms, were, reported, including, the, study, s, low, statistical, power, as, evidence, of, some, irregularity, such, as, bias, in, reporting, results, due, to, limits, of, sample, size, there, is, a, probability, that, an, effect, will, not, be, demonstrated, to, within, statistical, significance, even, if, it, exists, the, criticism, suggested, that, the, probability, that, all, the, experiments, reported, would, show, positive, results, if, an, identical, protocol, was, followed, assuming, the, claimed, effects, exist, is, merely, 0, 4, the, authors, also, did, not, indicate, which, mice, were, siblings, and, treated, all, of, the, mice, as, statistically, independent, the, original, researchers, pointed, out, negative, results, in, the, paper, s, appendix, that, the, criticism, omitted, in, its, calculations, and, undertook, to, track, which, mice, were, siblings, in, the, future, epigenetic, mechanisms, were, a, necessary, part, of, the, evolutionary, origin, of, cell, differentiation, although, epigenetics, in, multicellular, organisms, is, generally, thought, to, be, a, mechanism, involved, in, differentiation, with, epigenetic, patterns, reset, when, organisms, reproduce, there, have, been, some, observations, of, transgenerational, epigenetic, inheritance, e, g, the, phenomenon, of, paramutation, observed, in, maize, although, most, of, these, multigenerational, epigenetic, traits, are, gradually, lost, over, several, generations, the, possibility, remains, that, multigenerational, epigenetics, could, be, another, aspect, to, evolution, and, adaptation, as, mentioned, above, some, define, epigenetics, as, heritable, a, sequestered, germ, line, or, weismann, barrier, is, specific, to, animals, and, epigenetic, inheritance, is, more, common, in, plants, and, microbes, eva, jablonka, marion, j, lamb, and, tienne, danchin, have, argued, that, these, effects, may, require, enhancements, to, the, standard, conceptual, framework, of, the, modern, synthesis, and, have, called, for, an, extended, evolutionary, synthesis, other, evolutionary, biologists, such, as, john, maynard, smith, have, incorporated, epigenetic, inheritance, into, population, genetics, models, or, are, openly, skeptical, of, the, extended, evolutionary, synthesis, michael, lynch, thomas, dickins, and, qazi, rahman, state, that, epigenetic, mechanisms, such, as, dna, methylation, and, histone, modification, are, genetically, inherited, under, the, control, of, natural, selection, and, therefore, fit, under, the, earlier, modern, synthesis, two, important, ways, in, which, epigenetic, inheritance, can, differ, from, traditional, genetic, inheritance, with, important, consequences, for, evolution, are, in, plants, heritable, dna, methylation, mutations, are, 100, 000, times, more, likely, to, occur, compared, to, dna, mutations, an, epigenetically, inherited, element, such, as, the, psi, system, can, act, as, a, stop, gap, good, enough, for, short, term, adaptation, that, allows, the, lineage, to, survive, for, long, enough, for, mutation, and, or, recombination, to, genetically, assimilate, the, adaptive, phenotypic, change, the, existence, of, this, possibility, increases, the, evolvability, of, a, species, more, than, 100, cases, of, transgenerational, epigenetic, inheritance, phenomena, have, been, reported, in, a, wide, range, of, organisms, including, prokaryotes, plants, and, animals, for, instance, mourning, cloak, butterflies, will, change, color, through, hormone, changes, in, response, to, experimentation, of, varying, temperatures, the, filamentous, fungus, neurospora, crassa, is, a, prominent, model, system, for, understanding, the, control, and, function, of, cytosine, methylation, in, this, organism, dna, methylation, is, associated, with, relics, of, a, genome, defense, system, called, rip, repeat, induced, point, mutation, and, silences, gene, expression, by, inhibiting, transcription, elongation, the, yeast, prion, psi, is, generated, by, a, conformational, change, of, a, translation, termination, factor, which, is, then, inherited, by, daughter, cells, this, can, provide, a, survival, advantage, under, adverse, conditions, exemplifying, epigenetic, regulation, which, enables, unicellular, organisms, to, respond, rapidly, to, environmental, stress, prions, can, be, viewed, as, epigenetic, agents, capable, of, inducing, a, phenotypic, change, without, modification, of, the, genome, direct, detection, of, epigenetic, marks, in, microorganisms, is, possible, with, single, molecule, real, time, sequencing, in, which, polymerase, sensitivity, allows, for, measuring, methylation, and, other, modifications, as, a, dna, molecule, is, being, sequenced, several, projects, have, demonstrated, the, ability, to, collect, genome, wide, epigenetic, data, in, bacteria, while, epigenetics, is, of, fundamental, importance, in, eukaryotes, especially, metazoans, it, plays, a, different, role, in, bacteria, most, importantly, eukaryotes, use, epigenetic, mechanisms, primarily, to, regulate, gene, expression, which, bacteria, rarely, do, however, bacteria, make, widespread, use, of, postreplicative, dna, methylation, for, the, epigenetic, control, of, dna, protein, interactions, bacteria, also, use, dna, adenine, methylation, rather, than, dna, cytosine, methylation, as, an, epigenetic, signal, dna, adenine, methylation, is, important, in, bacteria, virulence, in, organisms, such, as, escherichia, coli, salmonella, vibrio, yersinia, haemophilus, and, brucella, in, alphaproteobacteria, methylation, of, adenine, regulates, the, cell, cycle, and, couples, gene, transcription, to, dna, replication, in, gammaproteobacteria, adenine, methylation, provides, signals, for, dna, replication, chromosome, segregation, mismatch, repair, packaging, of, bacteriophage, transposase, activity, and, regulation, of, gene, expression, there, exists, a, genetic, switch, controlling, streptococcus, pneumoniae, the, pneumococcus, that, allows, the, bacterium, to, randomly, change, its, characteristics, into, six, alternative, states, that, could, pave, the, way, to, improved, vaccines, each, form, is, randomly, generated, by, a, phase, variable, methylation, system, the, ability, of, the, pneumococcus, to, cause, deadly, infections, is, different, in, each, of, these, six, states, similar, systems, exist, in, other, bacterial, genera, in, bacillota, such, as, clostridioides, difficile, adenine, methylation, regulates, sporulation, biofilm, formation, and, host, adaptation, epigenetics, has, many, and, varied, potential, medical, applications, direct, comparisons, of, identical, twins, constitute, an, optimal, model, for, interrogating, environmental, epigenetics, in, the, case, of, humans, with, different, environmental, exposures, monozygotic, identical, twins, were, epigenetically, indistinguishable, during, their, early, years, while, older, twins, had, remarkable, differences, in, the, overall, content, and, genomic, distribution, of, 5, methylcytosine, dna, and, histone, acetylation, the, twin, pairs, who, had, spent, less, of, their, lifetime, together, and, or, had, greater, differences, in, their, medical, histories, were, those, who, showed, the, largest, differences, in, their, levels, of, 5, methylcytosine, dna, and, acetylation, of, histones, h3, and, h4, dizygotic, fraternal, and, monozygotic, identical, twins, show, evidence, of, epigenetic, influence, in, humans, dna, sequence, differences, that, would, be, abundant, in, a, singleton, based, study, do, not, interfere, with, the, analysis, environmental, differences, can, produce, long, term, epigenetic, effects, and, different, developmental, monozygotic, twin, subtypes, may, be, different, with, respect, to, their, susceptibility, to, be, discordant, from, an, epigenetic, point, of, view, a, high, throughput, study, which, denotes, technology, that, looks, at, extensive, genetic, markers, focused, on, epigenetic, differences, between, monozygotic, twins, to, compare, global, and, locus, specific, changes, in, dna, methylation, and, histone, modifications, in, a, sample, of, 40, monozygotic, twin, pairs, in, this, case, only, healthy, twin, pairs, were, studied, but, a, wide, range, of, ages, was, represented, between, 3, and, 74, years, one, of, the, major, conclusions, from, this, study, was, that, there, is, an, age, dependent, accumulation, of, epigenetic, differences, between, the, two, siblings, of, twin, pairs, this, accumulation, suggests, the, existence, of, epigenetic, drift, epigenetic, drift, is, the, term, given, to, epigenetic, modifications, as, they, occur, as, a, direct, function, with, age, while, age, is, a, known, risk, factor, for, many, diseases, age, related, methylation, has, been, found, to, occur, differentially, at, specific, sites, along, the, genome, over, time, this, can, result, in, measurable, differences, between, biological, and, chronological, age, epigenetic, changes, have, been, found, to, be, reflective, of, lifestyle, and, may, act, as, functional, biomarkers, of, disease, before, clinical, threshold, is, reached, a, more, recent, study, where, 114, monozygotic, twins, and, 80, dizygotic, twins, were, analyzed, for, the, dna, methylation, status, of, around, 6000, unique, genomic, regions, concluded, that, epigenetic, similarity, at, the, time, of, blastocyst, splitting, may, also, contribute, to, phenotypic, similarities, in, monozygotic, co, twins, this, supports, the, notion, that, microenvironment, at, early, stages, of, embryonic, development, can, be, quite, important, for, the, establishment, of, epigenetic, marks, congenital, genetic, disease, is, well, understood, and, it, is, clear, that, epigenetics, can, play, a, role, for, example, in, the, case, of, angelman, syndrome, and, prader, willi, syndrome, these, are, normal, genetic, diseases, caused, by, gene, deletions, or, inactivation, of, the, genes, but, are, unusually, common, because, individuals, are, essentially, hemizygous, because, of, genomic, imprinting, and, therefore, a, single, gene, knock, out, is, sufficient, to, cause, the, disease, where, most, cases, would, require, both, copies, to, be, knocked, out, some, human, disorders, are, associated, with, genomic, imprinting, a, phenomenon, in, mammals, where, the, father, and, mother, contribute, different, epigenetic, patterns, for, specific, genomic, loci, in, their, germ, cells, the, best, known, case, of, imprinting, in, human, disorders, is, that, of, angelman, syndrome, and, prader, willi, syndrome, both, can, be, produced, by, the, same, genetic, mutation, chromosome, 15q, partial, deletion, and, the, particular, syndrome, that, will, develop, depends, on, whether, the, mutation, is, inherited, from, the, child, s, mother, or, from, their, father, in, the, verkalix, study, paternal, but, not, maternal, grandsons, of, swedish, men, who, were, exposed, during, preadolescence, to, famine, in, the, 19th, century, were, less, likely, to, die, of, cardiovascular, disease, if, food, was, plentiful, then, diabetes, mortality, in, the, grandchildren, increased, suggesting, that, this, was, a, transgenerational, epigenetic, inheritance, the, opposite, effect, was, observed, for, females, the, paternal, but, not, maternal, granddaughters, of, women, who, experienced, famine, while, in, the, womb, and, therefore, while, their, eggs, were, being, formed, lived, shorter, lives, on, average, the, use, of, beta, lactam, antibiotics, can, alter, glutamate, receptor, activity, and, the, action, of, cyclosporine, on, multiple, transcription, factors, additionally, lithium, can, impact, autophagy, of, aberrant, proteins, and, opioid, drugs, via, chronic, use, can, increase, the, expression, of, genes, associated, with, addictive, phenotypes, parental, nutrition, in, utero, exposure, to, stress, or, endocrine, disrupting, chemicals, male, induced, maternal, effects, such, as, the, attraction, of, differential, mate, quality, and, maternal, as, well, as, paternal, age, and, offspring, gender, could, all, possibly, influence, whether, a, germline, epimutation, is, ultimately, expressed, in, offspring, and, the, degree, to, which, intergenerational, inheritance, remains, stable, throughout, posterity, however, whether, and, to, what, extent, epigenetic, effects, can, be, transmitted, across, generations, remains, unclear, particularly, in, humans, addiction, is, a, disorder, of, the, brain, s, reward, system, which, arises, through, transcriptional, and, neuroepigenetic, mechanisms, and, occurs, over, time, from, chronically, high, levels, of, exposure, to, an, addictive, stimulus, e, g, morphine, cocaine, sexual, intercourse, gambling, transgenerational, epigenetic, inheritance, of, addictive, phenotypes, has, been, noted, to, occur, in, preclinical, studies, however, robust, evidence, in, support, of, the, persistence, of, epigenetic, effects, across, multiple, generations, has, yet, to, be, established, in, humans, for, example, an, epigenetic, effect, of, prenatal, exposure, to, smoking, that, is, observed, in, great, grandchildren, who, had, not, been, exposed, the, two, forms, of, heritable, information, namely, genetic, and, epigenetic, are, collectively, called, dual, inheritance, members, of, the, apobec, aid, family, of, cytosine, deaminases, may, concurrently, influence, genetic, and, epigenetic, inheritance, using, similar, molecular, mechanisms, and, may, be, a, point, of, crosstalk, between, these, conceptually, compartmentalized, processes, fluoroquinolone, antibiotics, induce, epigenetic, changes, in, mammalian, cells, through, iron, chelation, this, leads, to, epigenetic, effects, through, inhibition, of, ketoglutarate, dependent, dioxygenases, that, require, iron, as, a, co, factor, various, pharmacological, agents, are, applied, for, the, production, of, induced, pluripotent, stem, cells, ipsc, or, maintain, the, embryonic, stem, cell, esc, phenotypic, via, epigenetic, approach, adult, stem, cells, like, bone, marrow, stem, cells, have, also, shown, a, potential, to, differentiate, into, cardiac, competent, cells, when, treated, with, g9a, histone, methyltransferase, inhibitor, bix01294, cell, plasticity, which, is, the, adaptation, of, cells, to, stimuli, without, changes, in, their, genetic, code, requires, epigenetic, changes, these, have, been, observed, in, cell, plasticity, in, cancer, cells, during, epithelial, to, mesenchymal, transition, and, also, in, immune, cells, such, as, macrophages, interestingly, metabolic, changes, underly, these, adaptations, since, various, metabolites, play, crucial, roles, in, the, chemistry, of, epigenetic, marks, this, includes, for, instance, alpha, ketoglutarate, which, is, required, for, histone, demethylation, and, acetyl, coenzyme, a, which, is, required, for, histone, acetylation, epigenetic, regulation, of, gene, expression, that, could, be, altered, or, used, in, epigenome, editing, are, or, include, mrna, lncrna, modification, dna, methylation, modification, and, histone, modification, methylation, is, a, widely, characterized, mechanism, of, genetic, regulation, that, can, determine, biological, traits, however, strong, experimental, evidences, correlate, methylation, patterns, in, snps, as, an, important, additional, feature, for, the, classical, activation, inhibition, epigenetic, dogma, molecular, interaction, data, supported, by, colocalization, analyses, identify, multiple, nuclear, regulatory, pathways, linking, sequence, variation, to, disturbances, in, dna, methylation, and, molecular, and, phenotypic, variation, ubash3b, encodes, a, protein, with, tyrosine, phosphatase, activity, which, has, been, previously, linked, to, advanced, neoplasia, snp, rs7115089, was, identified, as, influencing, dna, methylation, and, expression, of, this, locus, as, well, as, and, body, mass, index, bmi, in, fact, snp, rs7115089, is, strongly, associated, with, bmi, and, with, genetic, variants, linked, to, other, cardiovascular, and, metabolic, traits, in, gwass, new, studies, suggesting, ubash3b, as, a, potential, mediator, of, adiposity, and, cardiometabolic, disease, in, addition, animal, models, demonstrated, that, ubash3b, expression, is, an, indicator, of, caloric, restriction, that, may, drive, programmed, susceptibility, to, obesity, and, it, is, associated, with, other, measures, of, adiposity, in, human, peripherical, blood, snp, rs730775, is, located, in, the, first, intron, of, nfkbie, and, is, a, cis, eqtl, for, nfkbie, in, whole, blood, nuclear, factor, nf, b, inhibitor, nfkbie, directly, inhibits, nf, b1, activity, and, is, significantly, co, expressed, with, nf, b1, also, it, is, associated, with, rheumatoid, arthritis, colocalization, analysis, supports, that, variants, for, the, majority, of, the, cpg, sites, in, snp, rs730775, cause, genetic, variation, at, the, nfkbie, locus, which, is, suggestible, linked, to, rheumatoid, arthritis, through, trans, acting, regulation, of, dna, methylation, by, nf, b, fatty, acid, desaturase, 1, fads1, is, a, key, enzyme, in, the, metabolism, of,
