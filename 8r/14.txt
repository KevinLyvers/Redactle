heredity, also, called, inheritance, or, biological, inheritance, is, the, passing, on, of, traits, from, parents, to, their, offspring, either, through, asexual, reproduction, or, sexual, reproduction, the, offspring, cells, or, organisms, acquire, the, genetic, information, of, their, parents, through, heredity, variations, between, individuals, can, accumulate, and, cause, species, to, evolve, by, natural, selection, the, study, of, heredity, in, biology, is, genetics, in, humans, eye, color, is, an, example, of, an, inherited, characteristic, an, individual, might, inherit, the, brown, eye, trait, from, one, of, the, parents, inherited, traits, are, controlled, by, genes, and, the, complete, set, of, genes, within, an, organism, s, genome, is, called, its, genotype, the, complete, set, of, observable, traits, of, the, structure, and, behavior, of, an, organism, is, called, its, phenotype, these, traits, arise, from, the, interaction, of, the, organism, s, genotype, with, the, environment, as, a, result, many, aspects, of, an, organism, s, phenotype, are, not, inherited, for, example, suntanned, skin, derives, from, the, interaction, between, a, person, s, genotype, and, sunlight, thus, suntans, are, not, passed, on, to, people, s, children, however, some, people, tan, more, easily, than, others, due, to, differences, in, their, genotype, a, striking, example, is, people, with, the, inherited, trait, of, albinism, who, do, not, tan, at, all, and, are, very, sensitive, to, sunburn, heritable, traits, are, known, to, be, passed, from, one, generation, to, the, next, via, dna, a, molecule, that, encodes, genetic, information, dna, is, a, long, polymer, that, incorporates, four, types, of, bases, which, are, interchangeable, the, nucleic, acid, sequence, the, sequence, of, bases, along, a, particular, dna, molecule, specifies, the, genetic, information, this, is, comparable, to, a, sequence, of, letters, spelling, out, a, passage, of, text, before, a, cell, divides, through, mitosis, the, dna, is, copied, so, that, each, of, the, resulting, two, cells, will, inherit, the, dna, sequence, a, portion, of, a, dna, molecule, that, specifies, a, single, functional, unit, is, called, a, gene, different, genes, have, different, sequences, of, bases, within, cells, the, long, strands, of, dna, form, condensed, structures, called, chromosomes, organisms, inherit, genetic, material, from, their, parents, in, the, form, of, homologous, chromosomes, containing, a, unique, combination, of, dna, sequences, that, code, for, genes, the, specific, location, of, a, dna, sequence, within, a, chromosome, is, known, as, a, locus, if, the, dna, sequence, at, a, particular, locus, varies, between, individuals, the, different, forms, of, this, sequence, are, called, alleles, dna, sequences, can, change, through, mutations, producing, new, alleles, if, a, mutation, occurs, within, a, gene, the, new, allele, may, affect, the, trait, that, the, gene, controls, altering, the, phenotype, of, the, organism, however, while, this, simple, correspondence, between, an, allele, and, a, trait, works, in, some, cases, most, traits, are, more, complex, and, are, controlled, by, multiple, interacting, genes, within, and, among, organisms, developmental, biologists, suggest, that, complex, interactions, in, genetic, networks, and, communication, among, cells, can, lead, to, heritable, variations, that, may, underlie, some, of, the, mechanics, in, developmental, plasticity, and, canalization, recent, findings, have, confirmed, important, examples, of, heritable, changes, that, cannot, be, explained, by, direct, agency, of, the, dna, molecule, these, phenomena, are, classed, as, epigenetic, inheritance, systems, that, are, causally, or, independently, evolving, over, genes, research, into, modes, and, mechanisms, of, epigenetic, inheritance, is, still, in, its, scientific, infancy, but, this, area, of, research, has, attracted, much, recent, activity, as, it, broadens, the, scope, of, heritability, and, evolutionary, biology, in, general, dna, methylation, marking, chromatin, self, sustaining, metabolic, loops, gene, silencing, by, rna, interference, and, the, three, dimensional, conformation, of, proteins, such, as, prions, are, areas, where, epigenetic, inheritance, systems, have, been, discovered, at, the, organismic, level, heritability, may, also, occur, at, even, larger, scales, for, example, ecological, inheritance, through, the, process, of, niche, construction, is, defined, by, the, regular, and, repeated, activities, of, organisms, in, their, environment, this, generates, a, legacy, of, effect, that, modifies, and, feeds, back, into, the, selection, regime, of, subsequent, generations, descendants, inherit, genes, plus, environmental, characteristics, generated, by, the, ecological, actions, of, ancestors, other, examples, of, heritability, in, evolution, that, are, not, under, the, direct, control, of, genes, include, the, inheritance, of, cultural, traits, group, heritability, and, symbiogenesis, these, examples, of, heritability, that, operate, above, the, gene, are, covered, broadly, under, the, title, of, multilevel, or, hierarchical, selection, which, has, been, a, subject, of, intense, debate, in, the, history, of, evolutionary, science, when, charles, darwin, proposed, his, theory, of, evolution, in, 1859, one, of, its, major, problems, was, the, lack, of, an, underlying, mechanism, for, heredity, darwin, believed, in, a, mix, of, blending, inheritance, and, the, inheritance, of, acquired, traits, pangenesis, blending, inheritance, would, lead, to, uniformity, across, populations, in, only, a, few, generations, and, then, would, remove, variation, from, a, population, on, which, natural, selection, could, act, this, led, to, darwin, adopting, some, lamarckian, ideas, in, later, editions, of, on, the, origin, of, species, and, his, later, biological, works, darwin, s, primary, approach, to, heredity, was, to, outline, how, it, appeared, to, work, noticing, that, traits, that, were, not, expressed, explicitly, in, the, parent, at, the, time, of, reproduction, could, be, inherited, that, certain, traits, could, be, sex, linked, etc, rather, than, suggesting, mechanisms, darwin, s, initial, model, of, heredity, was, adopted, by, and, then, heavily, modified, by, his, cousin, francis, galton, who, laid, the, framework, for, the, biometric, school, of, heredity, galton, found, no, evidence, to, support, the, aspects, of, darwin, s, pangenesis, model, which, relied, on, acquired, traits, the, inheritance, of, acquired, traits, was, shown, to, have, little, basis, in, the, 1880s, when, august, weismann, cut, the, tails, off, many, generations, of, mice, and, found, that, their, offspring, continued, to, develop, tails, scientists, in, antiquity, had, a, variety, of, ideas, about, heredity, theophrastus, proposed, that, male, flowers, caused, female, flowers, to, ripen, hippocrates, speculated, that, seeds, were, produced, by, various, body, parts, and, transmitted, to, offspring, at, the, time, of, conception, and, aristotle, thought, that, male, and, female, fluids, mixed, at, conception, aeschylus, in, 458, bc, proposed, the, male, as, the, parent, with, the, female, as, a, nurse, for, the, young, life, sown, within, her, ancient, understandings, of, heredity, transitioned, to, two, debated, doctrines, in, the, 18th, century, the, doctrine, of, epigenesis, and, the, doctrine, of, preformation, were, two, distinct, views, of, the, understanding, of, heredity, the, doctrine, of, epigenesis, originated, by, aristotle, claimed, that, an, embryo, continually, develops, the, modifications, of, the, parent, s, traits, are, passed, off, to, an, embryo, during, its, lifetime, the, foundation, of, this, doctrine, was, based, on, the, theory, of, inheritance, of, acquired, traits, in, direct, opposition, the, doctrine, of, preformation, claimed, that, like, generates, like, where, the, germ, would, evolve, to, yield, offspring, similar, to, the, parents, the, preformationist, view, believed, procreation, was, an, act, of, revealing, what, had, been, created, long, before, however, this, was, disputed, by, the, creation, of, the, cell, theory, in, the, 19th, century, where, the, fundamental, unit, of, life, is, the, cell, and, not, some, preformed, parts, of, an, organism, various, hereditary, mechanisms, including, blending, inheritance, were, also, envisaged, without, being, properly, tested, or, quantified, and, were, later, disputed, nevertheless, people, were, able, to, develop, domestic, breeds, of, animals, as, well, as, crops, through, artificial, selection, the, inheritance, of, acquired, traits, also, formed, a, part, of, early, lamarckian, ideas, on, evolution, during, the, 18th, century, dutch, microscopist, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, 1632, 1723, discovered, animalcules, in, the, sperm, of, humans, and, other, animals, some, scientists, speculated, they, saw, a, little, man, homunculus, inside, each, sperm, these, scientists, formed, a, school, of, thought, known, as, the, spermists, they, contended, the, only, contributions, of, the, female, to, the, next, generation, were, the, womb, in, which, the, homunculus, grew, and, prenatal, influences, of, the, womb, an, opposing, school, of, thought, the, ovists, believed, that, the, future, human, was, in, the, egg, and, that, sperm, merely, stimulated, the, growth, of, the, egg, ovists, thought, women, carried, eggs, containing, boy, and, girl, children, and, that, the, gender, of, the, offspring, was, determined, well, before, conception, an, early, research, initiative, emerged, in, 1878, when, alpheus, hyatt, led, an, investigation, to, study, the, laws, of, heredity, through, compiling, data, on, family, phenotypes, nose, size, ear, shape, etc, and, expression, of, pathological, conditions, and, abnormal, characteristics, particularly, with, respect, to, the, age, of, appearance, one, of, the, projects, aims, was, to, tabulate, data, to, better, understand, why, certain, traits, are, consistently, expressed, while, others, are, highly, irregular, the, idea, of, particulate, inheritance, of, genes, can, be, attributed, to, the, moravian, monk, gregor, mendel, who, published, his, work, on, pea, plants, in, 1865, however, his, work, was, not, widely, known, and, was, rediscovered, in, 1901, it, was, initially, assumed, that, mendelian, inheritance, only, accounted, for, large, qualitative, differences, such, as, those, seen, by, mendel, in, his, pea, plants, and, the, idea, of, additive, effect, of, quantitative, genes, was, not, realised, until, r, a, fisher, s, 1918, paper, the, correlation, between, relatives, on, the, supposition, of, mendelian, inheritance, mendel, s, overall, contribution, gave, scientists, a, useful, overview, that, traits, were, inheritable, his, pea, plant, demonstration, became, the, foundation, of, the, study, of, mendelian, traits, these, traits, can, be, traced, on, a, single, locus, in, the, 1930s, work, by, fisher, and, others, resulted, in, a, combination, of, mendelian, and, biometric, schools, into, the, modern, evolutionary, synthesis, the, modern, synthesis, bridged, the, gap, between, experimental, geneticists, and, naturalists, and, between, both, and, palaeontologists, stating, that, the, idea, that, speciation, occurs, after, populations, are, reproductively, isolated, has, been, much, debated, in, plants, polyploidy, must, be, included, in, any, view, of, speciation, formulations, such, as, evolution, consists, primarily, of, changes, in, the, frequencies, of, alleles, between, one, generation, and, another, were, proposed, rather, later, the, traditional, view, is, that, developmental, biology, evo, devo, played, little, part, in, the, synthesis, but, an, account, of, gavin, de, beer, s, work, by, stephen, jay, gould, suggests, he, may, be, an, exception, almost, all, aspects, of, the, synthesis, have, been, challenged, at, times, with, varying, degrees, of, success, there, is, no, doubt, however, that, the, synthesis, was, a, great, landmark, in, evolutionary, biology, it, cleared, up, many, confusions, and, was, directly, responsible, for, stimulating, a, great, deal, of, research, in, the, post, world, war, ii, era, trofim, lysenko, however, caused, a, backlash, of, what, is, now, called, lysenkoism, in, the, soviet, union, when, he, emphasised, lamarckian, ideas, on, the, inheritance, of, acquired, traits, this, movement, affected, agricultural, research, and, led, to, food, shortages, in, the, 1960s, and, seriously, affected, the, ussr, there, is, growing, evidence, that, there, is, transgenerational, inheritance, of, epigenetic, changes, in, humans, and, other, animals, the, description, of, a, mode, of, biological, inheritance, consists, of, three, main, categories, these, three, categories, are, part, of, every, exact, description, of, a, mode, of, inheritance, in, the, above, order, in, addition, more, specifications, may, be, added, as, follows, determination, and, description, of, a, mode, of, inheritance, is, also, achieved, primarily, through, statistical, analysis, of, pedigree, data, in, case, the, involved, loci, are, known, methods, of, molecular, genetics, can, also, be, employed, an, allele, is, said, to, be, dominant, if, it, is, always, expressed, in, the, appearance, of, an, organism, phenotype, provided, that, at, least, one, copy, of, it, is, present, for, example, in, peas, the, allele, for, green, pods, g, is, dominant, to, that, for, yellow, pods, g, thus, pea, plants, with, the, pair, of, alleles, either, gg, homozygote, or, gg, heterozygote, will, have, green, pods, the, allele, for, yellow, pods, is, recessive, the, effects, of, this, allele, are, only, seen, when, it, is, present, in, both, chromosomes, gg, homozygote, this, derives, from, zygosity, the, degree, to, which, both, copies, of, a, chromosome, or, gene, have, the, same, genetic, sequence, in, other, words, the, degree, of, similarity, of, the, alleles, in, an, organism
