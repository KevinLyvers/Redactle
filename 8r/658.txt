dark, red, oriental, magpie, pica, serica, corvus, pica, linnaeus, 1758, the, eurasian, magpie, or, common, magpie, pica, pica, is, a, resident, breeding, bird, throughout, the, northern, part, of, the, eurasian, continent, it, is, one, of, several, birds, in, the, crow, family, corvids, designated, magpies, and, belongs, to, the, holarctic, radiation, of, monochrome, magpies, in, europe, magpie, is, used, by, english, speakers, as, a, synonym, for, the, eurasian, magpie, the, only, other, magpie, in, europe, is, the, iberian, magpie, cyanopica, cooki, which, is, limited, to, the, iberian, peninsula, despite, having, a, shared, name, and, similar, colouration, it, is, not, closely, related, to, the, australian, magpie, the, eurasian, magpie, is, one, of, the, most, intelligent, birds, and, it, is, believed, to, be, one, of, the, most, intelligent, of, all, non, human, animals, the, expansion, of, its, nidopallium, is, approximately, the, same, in, its, relative, size, as, the, brain, of, chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and, humans, it, is, the, only, bird, known, to, pass, the, mirror, test, along, with, very, few, other, non, avian, species, the, magpie, was, described, and, illustrated, by, swiss, naturalist, conrad, gessner, in, his, historiae, animalium, of, 1555, in, 1758, linnaeus, included, the, species, in, the, 10th, edition, of, his, systema, naturae, under, the, binomial, name, corvus, pica, the, magpie, was, moved, to, a, separate, genus, pica, by, the, french, zoologist, mathurin, jacques, brisson, in, 1760, pica, is, the, classical, latin, word, for, this, magpie, the, eurasian, magpie, is, almost, identical, in, appearance, to, the, north, american, black, billed, magpie, pica, hudsonia, and, at, one, time, the, two, species, were, considered, to, be, conspecific, in, 2000, the, american, ornithologists, union, decided, to, treat, the, black, billed, magpie, as, a, separate, species, based, on, studies, of, the, vocalization, and, behaviour, that, indicated, that, the, black, billed, magpie, was, closer, to, the, yellow, billed, magpie, pica, nuttalli, than, to, the, eurasian, magpie, the, gradual, clinal, variation, over, the, large, geographic, range, and, the, intergradation, of, the, different, subspecies, means, that, the, geographical, limits, and, acceptance, of, the, various, subspecies, vary, between, authorities, the, international, ornithological, congress, recognises, six, subspecies, a, seventh, p, p, hemileucoptera, is, included, in, p, p, bactriana, others, now, considered, as, distinct, species, a, study, using, both, mitochondrial, and, nuclear, dna, found, that, magpies, in, eastern, and, northeastern, china, are, genetically, very, similar, to, each, other, but, differ, from, those, in, northwestern, china, and, spain, magpies, were, originally, known, as, simply, pies, this, is, hypothesized, to, derive, from, a, proto, indo, european, root, s, peyk, meaning, pointed, in, reference, to, the, beak, or, perhaps, the, tail, cf, woodpecker, the, prefix, mag, dates, from, the, 16th, century, and, comes, from, the, short, form, of, the, given, name, margaret, which, was, once, used, to, mean, women, in, general, as, joe, or, jack, is, used, for, men, today, the, pie, s, call, was, considered, to, sound, like, the, idle, chattering, of, a, woman, and, so, it, came, to, be, called, the, mag, pie, pie, as, a, term, for, the, bird, dates, to, the, 13th, century, and, the, word, pied, first, recorded, in, 1552, became, applied, to, other, birds, that, resembled, the, magpie, in, having, black, and, white, plumage, the, adult, male, of, the, nominate, subspecies, p, p, pica, is, 44, 46, cm, 17, 18, in, in, length, of, which, more, than, half, is, the, tail, the, wingspan, is, 52, 62, cm, 20, 24, in, the, head, neck, breast, and, vent, are, glossy, black, with, a, metallic, green, and, violet, sheen, the, belly, and, scapulars, shoulder, feathers, are, pure, white, the, wings, are, black, glossed, with, green, or, purple, and, the, primaries, have, white, inner, webs, conspicuous, when, the, wing, is, open, the, graduated, tail, is, black, glossed, with, green, and, reddish, purple, the, legs, and, bill, are, black, the, iris, is, dark, brown, the, rump, is, black, with, white, stripe, above, which, varies, in, thickness, between, subspecies, the, plumage, of, the, sexes, is, similar, but, females, are, slightly, smaller, the, tail, feathers, of, both, sexes, are, quite, long, about, 12, 28, cm, long, males, of, the, nominate, subspecies, weigh, 210, 272, g, 7, 4, 9, 6, oz, while, females, weigh, 182, 214, g, 6, 4, 7, 5, oz, the, young, resemble, the, adults, but, are, at, first, without, much, of, the, gloss, on, the, sooty, plumage, the, young, have, the, malar, region, pink, and, somewhat, clear, eyes, the, tail, is, much, shorter, than, the, adults, the, subspecies, differ, in, their, size, the, amount, of, white, on, their, plumage, and, the, colour, of, the, gloss, on, their, black, feathers, the, asian, subspecies, p, p, bactriana, has, more, extensive, white, on, the, primaries, and, a, prominent, white, rump, adults, undergo, an, annual, complete, moult, after, breeding, moult, begins, in, june, or, july, and, ends, in, september, or, october, the, primary, flight, feathers, are, replaced, over, a, period, of, three, months, juvenile, birds, undergo, a, partial, moult, beginning, about, one, month, later, than, the, adult, birds, in, which, their, body, feathers, are, replaced, but, not, those, of, the, wings, or, the, tail, eurasian, magpies, have, a, well, known, call, it, is, a, choking, chatter, chac, chac, or, a, repetitive, chac, chac, chac, chac, the, young, also, emit, the, previous, call, although, they, also, emit, an, acute, call, similar, to, a, uik, uik, which, may, resemble, the, barking, of, a, small, dog, both, adults, and, young, can, emit, a, kind, of, hiss, barely, noticeable, from, afar, the, range, of, the, magpie, extends, across, temperate, eurasia, from, portugal, spain, and, ireland, in, the, west, to, the, kamchatka, peninsula, the, preferred, habit, is, open, countryside, with, scattered, trees, and, magpies, are, normally, absent, from, treeless, areas, and, dense, forests, they, sometimes, breed, at, high, densities, in, suburban, settings, such, as, parks, and, gardens, they, can, often, be, found, close, to, the, centre, of, cities, magpies, are, normally, sedentary, and, spend, winters, close, to, their, nesting, territories, but, birds, living, near, the, northern, limit, of, their, range, in, sweden, finland, and, russia, can, move, south, in, harsh, weather, some, magpies, breed, after, their, first, year, while, others, remain, in, the, non, breeding, flocks, and, first, breed, in, their, second, year, they, are, monogamous, and, the, pairs, often, remain, together, from, one, breeding, season, to, the, next, they, generally, occupy, the, same, territory, on, successive, years, mating, takes, place, in, spring, in, the, courtship, display, males, rapidly, raise, and, depress, their, head, feathers, uplift, open, and, close, their, tails, like, fans, and, call, in, soft, tones, quite, distinct, from, their, usual, chatter, the, loose, feathers, of, the, flanks, are, brought, over, the, primaries, and, the, shoulder, patch, is, spread, so, the, white, is, conspicuous, presumably, to, attract, females, short, buoyant, flights, and, chases, follow, magpies, prefer, tall, trees, for, their, bulky, nest, firmly, attaching, them, to, a, central, fork, in, the, upper, branches, a, framework, of, the, sticks, is, cemented, with, earth, and, clay, and, a, lining, of, the, same, is, covered, with, fine, roots, above, is, a, stout, though, loosely, built, dome, of, prickly, branches, with, a, single, well, concealed, entrance, these, huge, nests, are, conspicuous, when, the, leaves, fall, where, trees, are, scarce, though, even, in, well, wooded, country, nests, are, at, times, built, in, bushes, and, hedgerows, in, europe, clutches, are, typically, laid, in, april, and, usually, contain, five, or, six, eggs, but, clutches, with, as, few, as, three, and, as, many, as, ten, have, been, recorded, the, eggs, are, laid, in, early, morning, usually, at, daily, intervals, on, average, the, eggs, of, the, nominate, species, measure, 32, 9, mm, 23, mm, 1, 30, in, 0, 91, in, and, weigh, 9, 9, g, 0, 35, oz, small, for, the, size, of, the, bird, they, are, typically, pale, blue, green, with, close, specks, and, spots, of, olive, brown, but, show, much, variation, in, ground, and, marking, the, eggs, are, incubated, for, 21, 22, days, by, the, female, who, is, fed, on, the, nest, by, the, male, the, chicks, are, altricial, hatching, nearly, naked, with, closed, eyes, they, are, brooded, by, the, female, for, the, first, 5, 10, days, and, fed, by, both, parents, initially, the, parents, eat, the, faecal, sacs, of, the, nestlings, but, as, the, chicks, grow, larger, they, defecate, on, the, edge, of, the, nest, the, nestlings, open, their, eyes, 7, to, 8, days, after, hatching, their, body, feathers, start, to, appear, after, around, 8, days, and, the, primary, wing, feathers, after, 10, days, for, several, days, before, they, are, ready, to, leave, the, nest, the, chicks, clamber, around, the, nearby, branches, they, fledge, at, around, 27, days, the, parents, then, continue, to, feed, the, chicks, for, several, more, weeks, they, also, protect, the, chicks, from, predators, as, their, ability, to, fly, is, poor, making, them, vulnerable, on, average, only, 3, or, 4, chicks, survive, to, fledge, successfully, some, nests, are, lost, to, predators, but, an, important, factor, causing, nestling, mortality, is, starvation, magpie, eggs, hatch, asynchronously, and, if, the, parents, have, difficulty, finding, sufficient, food, the, last, chicks, to, hatch, are, unlikely, to, survive, only, a, single, brood, is, reared, unless, disaster, overtakes, the, first, clutch, a, study, conducted, near, sheffield, in, britain, using, birds, with, coloured, rings, on, their, legs, found, that, only, 22, of, fledglings, survived, their, first, year, for, subsequent, years, the, survival, rate, for, the, adult, birds, was, 69, implying, that, for, those, birds, that, survive, the, first, year, the, average, total, lifespan, was, 3, 7, years, the, maximum, age, recorded, for, a, magpie, is, 21, years, and, 8, months, for, a, bird, from, near, coventry, in, england, that, was, ringed, in, 1925, and, shot, in, 1947, the, magpie, is, omnivorous, eating, young, birds, and, eggs, small, mammals, insects, scraps, and, carrion, acorns, grain, and, other, vegetable, substances, along, with, other, corvids, such, as, ravens, western, jackdaws, and, crows, the, eurasian, magpie, is, believed, to, be, not, only, among, the, most, intelligent, of, birds, but, also, among, the, most, intelligent, of, all, animals, the, eurasian, magpie, s, nidopallium, is, approximately, the, same, relative, size, as, those, in, chimpanzees, and, humans, and, significantly, larger, than, those, of, the, gibbons, their, total, brain, to, body, mass, ratio, is, equal, to, most, great, apes, and, cetaceans, a, 2004, review, suggests, that, the, intelligence, of, the, corvid, family, to, which, the, eurasian, magpie, belongs, is, equivalent, to, that, of, the, great, apes, bonobos, gorillas, and, orangutans, in, terms, of, social, cognition, causal, reasoning, flexibility, imagination, and, prospection, magpies, have, been, observed, engaging, in, elaborate, social, rituals, possibly, including, the, expression, of, grief, mirror, self, recognition, has, been, demonstrated, in, european, magpies, making, them, one, of, only, a, few, species, known, to, possess, this, capability, the, cognitive, abilities, of, the, eurasian, magpie, are, regarded, as, evidence, that, intelligence, evolved, independently, in, both, corvids, and, primates, this, is, indicated, by, tool, use, an, ability, to, hide, and, store, food, across, seasons, episodic, memory, and, using, their, own, experience, to, predict, the, behavior, of, conspecifics, another, behaviour, exhibiting, intelligence, is, cutting, their, food, in, correctly, sized, proportions, for, the, size, of, their, young, in, captivity, magpies, have, been, observed, counting, up, to, get, food, imitating, human, voices, and, regularly, using, tools, to, clean, their, own, cages, in, the, wild, they, organise, themselves, into, gangs, and, use, complex, strategies, hunting, other, birds, and, when, confronted, by, predators, the, eurasian, magpie, has, an, extremely, large, range, the, european, population, is, estimated, to, be, between, 7, 5, and, 19, million, breeding, pairs, allowing, for, the, birds, breeding, in, other, continents, the, total, population, is, estimated, to, be, between, 46, and, 228, million, individuals, the, population, trend, in, europe, has, been, stable, since, 1980, there, is, no, evidence, of, any, serious, overall, decline, in, numbers, so, the, species, is, classified, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, as, being, of, least, concern, in, europe, magpies, have, been, historically, demonized, by, humans, mainly, as, a, result, of, superstition, and, myth, the, bird, has, found, itself, in, this, situation, mainly, by, association, says, steve, roud, large, black, birds, like, crows, and, ravens, are, viewed, as, evil, in, british, folklore, and, white, birds, are, viewed, as, good, in, european, folklore, the, magpie, is, associated, with, a, number, of, superstitions, surrounding, its, reputation, as, an, omen, of, ill, fortune, in, the, 19th, century, book, a, guide, to, the, scientific, knowledge, of, things, familiar, a, proverb, concerning, magpies, is, recited, a, single, magpie, in, spring, foul, weather, will, bring, the, book, further, explains, that, this, superstition, arises, from, the, habits, of, pairs, of, magpies, to, forage, together, only, when, the, weather, is, fine, in, scotland, a, magpie, near, the, window, of, the, house, is, said, to, foretell, death, an, english, tradition, holds, that, a, single, magpie, be, greeted, with, a, salutation, in, order, to, ward, off, the, bad, luck, it, may, bring, a, greeting, might, be, something, like, good, morning, mr, magpie, how, are, mrs, magpie, and, all, the, other, little, magpies, and, a, 19th, century, version, recorded, in, shropshire, is, to, say, devil, devil, i, defy, thee, magpie, magpie, i, go, by, thee, and, to, spit, on, the, ground, three, times, in, britain, and, ireland, a, widespread, traditional, rhyme, one, for, sorrow, records, the, myth, it, is, not, clear, whether, it, has, been, seriously, believed, that, seeing, magpies, predicts, the, future, depending, on, how, many, are, seen, there, are, many, regional, variations, on, the, rhyme, which, means, that, it, is, impossible, to, give, a, definitive, version, in, italian, british, and, french, folklore, magpies, are, believed, to, have, a, penchant, for, picking, up, shiny, items, particularly, precious, stones, or, metal, objects, rossini, s, opera, la, gazza, ladra, and, the, adventures, of, tintin, comic, the, castafiore, emerald, are, based, on, this, theme, however, one, recent, research, study, has, cast, doubt, on, the, veracity, of, this, belief, in, bulgarian, czech, german, hungarian, polish, russian, slovak, and, swedish, folklore, the, magpie, is, seen, as, a, thief, in, hungary, there, is, an, old, saying, which, said, when, you, heard, a, magpie, singing, it, meant, guests, would, be, coming, to, your, house, perhaps, because, the, magpie, loved, to, sit, on, the, trees, in, front, of, the, village, houses, and, signaled, when, a, man, was, approaching, in, sweden, it, is, further, associated, with, witchcraft, in, norway, a, magpie, is, considered, cunning, and, thievish, but, also, the, bird, of, hulder, the, underground, people, magpies, have, been, attacked, for, their, role, as, predators, which, includes, eating, other, birds, eggs, and, their, young, mostly, smaller, songbirds, however, one, study, has, disputed, the, view, that, they, affect, total, song, bird, populations, finding, no, evidence, of, any, effects, of, predator, species, on, songbird, population, growth, rates, we, therefore, had, no, indication, that, predators, had, a, general, effect, on, songbird, population, growth, rates, another, study, has, claimed, that, smaller, songbird, populations, increased, in, places, where, magpie, populations, were, high, and, that, they, do, not, have, a, negative, impact, on, the, total, songbird, population
