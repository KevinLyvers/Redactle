monkey, is, a, common, name, that, may, refer, to, most, mammals, of, the, infraorder, simiiformes, also, known, as, simians, traditionally, all, animals, in, the, group, now, known, as, simians, are, counted, as, monkeys, except, the, apes, thus, monkeys, in, that, sense, constitute, an, incomplete, paraphyletic, grouping, however, in, the, broader, sense, based, on, cladistics, apes, hominoidea, are, also, included, making, the, terms, monkeys, and, simians, synonyms, in, regard, to, their, scope, in, 1812, tienne, geoffroy, grouped, the, apes, and, the, cercopithecidae, group, of, monkeys, together, and, established, the, name, catarrhini, old, world, monkeys, singes, de, l, ancien, monde, in, french, the, extant, sister, of, the, catarrhini, in, the, monkey, singes, group, is, the, platyrrhini, new, world, monkeys, some, nine, million, years, before, the, divergence, between, the, cercopithecidae, and, the, apes, the, platyrrhini, emerged, within, monkeys, by, migration, to, south, america, from, afro, arabia, the, old, world, likely, by, ocean, apes, are, thus, deep, in, the, tree, of, extant, and, extinct, monkeys, and, any, of, the, apes, is, distinctly, closer, related, to, the, cercopithecidae, than, the, platyrrhini, are, many, monkey, species, are, tree, dwelling, arboreal, although, there, are, species, that, live, primarily, on, the, ground, such, as, baboons, most, species, are, mainly, active, during, the, day, diurnal, monkeys, are, generally, considered, to, be, intelligent, especially, the, old, world, monkeys, within, suborder, haplorhini, the, simians, are, a, sister, group, to, the, tarsiers, the, two, members, diverged, some, 70, million, years, ago, new, world, monkeys, and, catarrhine, monkeys, emerged, within, the, simians, roughly, 35, million, years, ago, old, world, monkeys, and, apes, emerged, within, the, catarrhine, monkeys, about, 25, million, years, ago, extinct, basal, simians, such, as, aegyptopithecus, or, parapithecus, 35, 32, million, years, ago, are, also, considered, monkeys, by, primatologists, lemurs, lorises, and, galagos, are, not, monkeys, but, strepsirrhine, primates, suborder, strepsirrhini, the, simians, sister, group, the, tarsiers, are, also, haplorhine, primates, however, they, are, also, not, monkeys, apes, emerged, within, monkeys, as, sister, of, the, cercopithecidae, in, the, catarrhini, so, cladistically, they, are, monkeys, as, well, however, there, has, been, resistance, to, directly, designate, apes, and, thus, humans, as, monkeys, so, old, world, monkey, may, be, taken, to, mean, either, the, cercopithecoidea, not, including, apes, or, the, catarrhini, including, apes, that, apes, are, monkeys, was, already, realized, by, georges, louis, leclerc, comte, de, buffon, in, the, 18th, century, linnaeus, placed, this, group, in, 1758, together, with, the, tarsiers, in, a, single, genus, simia, sans, homo, an, ensemble, now, recognised, as, the, haplorhini, monkeys, including, apes, can, be, distinguished, from, other, primates, by, having, only, two, pectoral, nipples, a, pendulous, penis, and, a, lack, of, sensory, whiskers, according, to, the, online, etymology, dictionary, the, word, monkey, may, originate, in, a, german, version, of, the, reynard, the, fox, fable, published, c, 1580, in, this, version, of, the, fable, a, character, named, moneke, is, the, son, of, martin, the, ape, in, english, no, clear, distinction, was, originally, made, between, ape, and, monkey, thus, the, 1911, encyclop, dia, britannica, entry, for, ape, notes, that, it, is, either, a, synonym, for, monkey, or, is, used, to, mean, a, tailless, humanlike, primate, colloquially, the, terms, monkey, and, ape, are, widely, used, interchangeably, also, a, few, monkey, species, have, the, word, ape, in, their, common, name, such, as, the, barbary, ape, later, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, idea, developed, that, there, were, trends, in, primate, evolution, and, that, the, living, members, of, the, order, could, be, arranged, in, a, series, leading, through, monkeys, and, apes, to, humans, monkeys, thus, constituted, a, grade, on, the, path, to, humans, and, were, distinguished, from, apes, scientific, classifications, are, now, more, often, based, on, monophyletic, groups, that, is, groups, consisting, of, all, the, descendants, of, a, common, ancestor, the, new, world, monkeys, and, the, old, world, monkeys, are, each, monophyletic, groups, but, their, combination, was, not, since, it, excluded, hominoids, apes, and, humans, thus, the, term, monkey, no, longer, referred, to, a, recognized, scientific, taxon, the, smallest, accepted, taxon, which, contains, all, the, monkeys, is, the, infraorder, simiiformes, or, simians, however, this, also, contains, the, hominoids, so, that, monkeys, are, in, terms, of, currently, recognized, taxa, non, hominoid, simians, colloquially, and, pop, culturally, the, term, is, ambiguous, and, sometimes, monkey, includes, non, human, hominoids, in, addition, frequent, arguments, are, made, for, a, monophyletic, usage, of, the, word, monkey, from, the, perspective, that, usage, should, reflect, cladistics, several, science, fiction, and, fantasy, stories, have, depicted, non, human, fantastical, or, alien, antagonistic, characters, refer, to, humans, as, monkeys, usually, in, a, derogatory, manner, as, a, form, of, metacommentary, a, group, of, monkeys, may, be, commonly, referred, to, as, a, tribe, or, a, troop, two, separate, groups, of, primates, are, referred, to, as, monkeys, new, world, monkeys, platyrrhines, from, south, and, central, america, and, old, world, monkeys, catarrhines, in, the, superfamily, cercopithecoidea, from, africa, and, asia, apes, hominoids, consisting, of, gibbons, orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, and, humans, are, also, catarrhines, but, were, classically, distinguished, from, monkeys, tailless, monkeys, may, be, called, apes, incorrectly, according, to, modern, usage, thus, the, tailless, barbary, macaque, is, historically, called, the, barbary, ape, as, apes, have, emerged, in, the, monkey, group, as, sister, of, the, old, world, monkeys, characteristics, that, describe, monkeys, are, generally, shared, by, apes, as, well, williams, et, al, outlined, evolutionary, features, including, in, stem, groupings, contrasted, against, the, other, primates, such, as, the, tarsiers, and, the, lemuriformes, monkeys, range, in, size, from, the, pygmy, marmoset, which, can, be, as, small, as, 117, mm, 4, 5, 8, in,

arboreal, living, in, trees, while, others, live, on, the, savanna, diets, differ, among, the, various, species, but, may, contain, any, of, the, following, fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers, eggs, and, small, animals, including, insects, and, spiders, some, characteristics, are, shared, among, the, groups, most, new, world, monkeys, have, long, tails, with, those, in, the, atelidae, family, being, prehensile, while, old, world, monkeys, have, non, prehensile, tails, or, no, visible, tail, at, all, old, world, monkeys, have, trichromatic, color, vision, like, that, of, humans, while, new, world, monkeys, may, be, trichromatic, dichromatic, or, as, in, the, owl, monkeys, and, greater, galagos, monochromatic, although, both, the, new, and, old, world, monkeys, like, the, apes, have, forward, facing, eyes, the, faces, of, old, world, and, new, world, monkeys, look, very, different, though, again, each, group, shares, some, features, such, as, the, types, of, noses, cheeks, and, rumps, the, following, list, shows, where, the, various, monkey, families, bolded, are, placed, in, the, classification, of, living, extant, primates, below, is, a, cladogram, with, some, extinct,

common, monkey, species, found, in, animal, research, are, the, grivet, the, rhesus, macaque, and, the, crab, eating, macaque, which, are, either, wild, caught, or, purpose, bred, they, are, used, primarily, because, of, their, relative, ease, of, handling, their, fast, reproductive, cycle, compared, to, apes, and, their, psychological, and, physical, similarity, to, humans, worldwide, it, is, thought, that, between, 100, 000, and, 200, 000, non, human, primates, are, used, in, research, each, year, 64, 7, of, which, are, old, world, monkeys, and, 5, 5, new, world, monkeys, this, number, makes, a, very, small, fraction, of, all, animals, used, in, research, between, 1994, and, 2004, the, united, states, has, used, an, average, of, 54, 000, non, human, primates, while, around, 10, 000, non, human, primates, were, used, in, the, european, union, in, 2002, a, number, of, countries, have, used, monkeys, as, part, of, their, space, exploration, programmes, including, the, united,
