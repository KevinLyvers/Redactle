mole, crickets, are, members, of, the, insect, family, gryllotalpidae, in, the, order, orthoptera, grasshoppers, locusts, and, crickets, mole, crickets, are, cylindrical, bodied, fossorial, insects, about, 3, 5, cm, 1, 2, 2, 0, in, long, as, adults, with, small, eyes, and, shovel, like, fore, limbs, highly, developed, for, burrowing, they, are, present, in, many, parts, of, the, world, and, where, they, have, arrived, in, new, regions, may, become, agricultural, pests, mole, crickets, have, three, life, stages, eggs, nymphs, and, adults, most, of, their, lives, in, these, stages, are, spent, underground, but, adults, have, wings, and, disperse, in, the, breeding, season, they, vary, in, their, diet, some, species, are, herbivores, mainly, feeding, on, roots, others, are, omnivores, including, worms, and, grubs, in, their, diet, and, a, few, are, largely, predatory, male, mole, crickets, have, an, exceptionally, loud, song, they, sing, from, a, burrow, that, opens, out, into, the, air, in, the, shape, of, an, exponential, horn, the, song, is, an, almost, pure, tone, modulated, into, chirps, it, is, used, to, attract, females, either, for, mating, or, for, indicating, favourable, habitats, for, them, to, lay, their, eggs, in, zambia, mole, crickets, are, thought, to, bring, good, fortune, while, in, latin, america, they, are, said, to, predict, rain, in, florida, where, neoscapteriscus, mole, crickets, are, not, native, they, are, considered, pests, and, various, biological, controls, have, been, used, gryllotalpa, species, have, been, used, as, food, in, west, java, vietnam, thailand, laos, and, the, philippines, mole, crickets, vary, in, size, and, appearance, but, most, of, them, are, of, moderate, size, for, an, insect, typically, between, 3, 2, and, 3, 5, cm, 1, 3, and, 1, 4, in, long, as, adults, they, are, adapted, for, underground, life, and, are, cylindrical, in, shape, and, covered, with, fine, dense, hairs, the, head, fore, limbs, and, prothorax, are, heavily, sclerotised, but, the, abdomen, is, rather, soft, the, head, bears, two, threadlike, antennae, and, a, pair, of, beady, eyes, the, two, pairs, of, wings, are, folded, flat, over, the, abdomen, in, most, species, the, fore, wings, are, short, and, rounded, and, the, hind, wings, are, membranous, and, reach, or, exceed, the, tip, of, the, abdomen, however, in, some, species, the, hind, wings, are, reduced, in, size, and, the, insect, is, unable, to, fly, the, fore, legs, are, flattened, for, digging, but, the, hind, legs, are, shaped, somewhat, like, the, legs, of, a, true, cricket, however, these, limbs, are, more, adapted, for, pushing, soil, rather, than, leaping, which, they, do, rarely, and, poorly, the, nymphs, resemble, the, adults, apart, from, the, absence, of, wings, and, genitalia, the, wing, pads, become, larger, after, each, successive, moult, the, gryllotalpidae, are, a, monophyletic, group, in, the, order, orthoptera, grasshoppers, locusts, and, crickets, cladistic, analysis, of, mole, cricket, morphology, in, 2015, identified, six, tribes, of, which, four, were, then, new, indioscaptorini, scapteriscinae, triamescaptorini, gryllotalpellini, and, neocurtillini, gryllotalpinae, and, two, existing, tribes, scapteriscini, and, gryllotalpini, are, revised, the, group, name, is, derived, straightforwardly, from, latin, gryllus, cricket, and, talpa, mole, within, the, extant, subfamilies, genera, include, mole, cricket, fossils, are, rare, a, stem, group, fossil, cratotetraspinus, is, known, from, the, lower, cretaceous, of, brazil, two, specimens, of, marchandia, magnifica, in, amber, have, been, found, in, the, lower, cretaceous, of, charente, maritime, in, france, they, are, somewhat, more, abundant, in, the, tertiary, amber, of, the, baltic, and, dominican, regions, impressions, are, found, in, europe, and, the, american, green, river, formation, mole, crickets, are, not, closely, related, to, the, pygmy, mole, crickets, the, tridactyloidea, which, are, in, the, grasshopper, suborder, caelifera, rather, than, the, cricket, suborder, ensifera, the, two, groups, and, indeed, their, resemblance, in, form, to, the, mammalian, mole, family, talpidae, with, their, powerful, front, limbs, form, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, both, developing, adaptations, for, burrowing, adults, of, most, species, of, mole, cricket, can, fly, powerfully, if, not, with, agility, but, males, do, so, infrequently, the, females, typically, take, wing, soon, after, sunset, and, are, attracted, to, areas, where, males, are, calling, which, they, do, for, about, an, hour, after, sunset, this, may, be, to, mate, or, they, may, be, influenced, by, the, suitability, of, the, habitat, for, egg, laying, as, demonstrated, by, the, number, of, males, present, and, calling, in, the, vicinity, mole, crickets, undergo, incomplete, metamorphosis, when, nymphs, hatch, from, eggs, they, increasingly, resemble, the, adult, form, as, they, grow, and, pass, through, a, series, of, up, to, 10, moults, after, mating, a, period, of, 1, 2, weeks, may, occur, before, the, female, starts, laying, eggs, she, burrows, into, the, soil, to, a, depth, of, 30, cm, 12, in, 72, cm, 28, in, has, been, seen, in, the, laboratory, and, lays, a, clutch, of, 25, to, 60, eggs, neoscapteriscus, females, then, retire, sealing, the, entrance, passage, but, in, gryllotalpa, and, neocurtilla, species, the, female, has, been, observed, to, remain, in, an, adjoining, chamber, to, tend, the, clutch, further, clutches, may, follow, over, several, months, according, to, species, eggs, must, be, laid, in, moist, ground, and, many, nymphs, die, because, of, insufficient, moisture, in, the, soil, the, eggs, hatch, in, a, few, weeks, and, as, they, grow, the, nymphs, consume, a, great, deal, of, plant, material, either, underground, or, on, the, surface, the, adults, of, some, species, of, mole, crickets, may, move, as, far, as, 8, km, 5, 0, mi, during, the, breeding, season, mole, crickets, are, active, most, of, the, year, but, overwinter, as, nymphs, or, adults, in, cooler, climates, resuming, activity, in, the, spring, mole, crickets, live, almost, entirely, below, ground, digging, tunnels, of, different, kinds, for, the, major, functions, of, life, including, feeding, escape, from, predators, attracting, a, mate, by, singing, mating, and, raising, of, young, their, main, tunnels, are, used, for, feeding, and, for, escape, they, can, dig, themselves, under, ground, very, rapidly, and, can, move, along, existing, tunnels, at, high, speed, both, forwards, and, backwards, their, digging, technique, is, to, force, the, soil, to, either, side, with, their, powerful, shovel, like, fore, limbs, which, are, broad, flattened, toothed, and, heavily, sclerotised, the, cuticle, is, hardened, and, darkened, males, attract, mates, by, constructing, specially, shaped, tunnels, in, which, they, sing, mating, takes, place, in, the, male, s, burrow, the, male, may, widen, a, tunnel, to, make, room, for, the, female, to, mount, though, in, some, species, mating, is, tail, to, tail, females, lay, their, eggs, either, in, their, normal, burrows, or, in, specially, dug, brood, chambers, which, are, sealed, when, complete, in, the, case, of, the, genus, neoscapteriscus, or, not, sealed, in, the, case, of, genera, gryllotalpa, and, neocurtilla, male, mole, crickets, sing, by, stridulating, always, under, ground, in, gryllotalpa, gryllotalpa, the, song, is, based, on, an, almost, pure, tone, at, 3, 5, khz, loud, enough, to, make, the, ground, vibrate, 20, cm, all, round, the, burrow, in, fact, the, song, is, unique, in, each, species, in, g, gryllotalpa, the, burrow, is, somewhat, roughly, sculpted, in, g, vineae, the, burrow, is, smooth, and, carefully, shaped, with, no, irregularities, larger, than, 1, mm, in, both, species, the, burrow, has, two, openings, at, the, soil, surface, at, the, other, end, is, a, constriction, then, a, resonating, bulb, and, then, an, escape, tunnel, a, burrow, is, used, for, at, least, a, week, the, male, positions, himself, head, down, with, his, head, in, the, bulb, and, his, tail, is, near, the, fork, in, the, tunnel, mole, crickets, stridulate, like, other, crickets, by, scraping, the, rear, edge, of, the, left, fore, wing, which, forms, a, plectrum, against, the, lower, surface, of, the, right, fore, wing, which, has, a, ratchet, like, series, of, asymmetric, teeth, the, more, acute, edges, face, backwards, as, do, those, of, the, plectrum, the, plectrum, can, move, forward, with, little, resistance, but, moving, it, backwards, makes, it, catch, each, tooth, setting, up, a, vibration, in, both, wings, the, sound, producing, stroke, is, the, raising, levation, of, the, wings, the, resulting, song, resembles, the, result, of, modulating, a, pure, tone, with, a, 66, hz, wave, to, form, regular, chirps, in, g, vineae, the, wing, levator, muscle, which, weighs, 50, mg, can, deliver, 3, 5, milliwatts, of, mechanical, power, g, gryllotalpa, can, deliver, about, 1, milliwatt, g, vineae, produces, an, exceptionally, loud, song, from, half, an, hour, after, sunset, continuing, for, an, hour, it, can, be, heard, up, to, 600, m, away, at, a, distance, of, 1, m, from, the, burrow, the, sound, has, a, mean, power, over, the, stridulation, cycle, up, to, 88, decibels, the, loudest, recorded, peak, power, was, about, 92, decibels, at, the, mouths, of, the, burrow, the, sound, reaches, around, 115, decibels, g, gryllotalpa, can, deliver, a, peak, sound, pressure, of, 72, decibels, and, a, mean, of, about, 66, decibels, the, throat, of, the, horn, appears, to, be, tuned, offering, low, inductive, reactance, making, the, burrow, radiate, sound, efficiently, the, efficiency, increases, when, the, burrow, is, wet, and, absorbs, less, sound, mole, crickets, are, the, only, insects, that, construct, a, sound, producing, apparatus, given, the, known, sensitivity, of, a, cricket, s, hearing, 60, decibels, a, night, flying, g, vineae, female, should, be, able, to, detect, the, male, s, song, at, a, range, of, 30, m, this, compares, to, about, 5, m, for, a, typical, gryllus, cricket, that, does, not, construct, a, burrow, the, loudness, of, the, song, is, correlated, with, the, size, of, the, male, and, the, quality, of, the, habitat, both, indicators, of, male, attractiveness, the, loudest, males, may, attract, 20, females, in, one, evening, while, a, quieter, male, may, attract, none, this, behaviour, enables, acoustic, trapping, females, can, be, trapped, in, large, numbers, by, broadcasting, a, male, s, song, very, loudly, mole, crickets, vary, in, their, diets, some, like, the, tawny, mole, cricket, are, herbivores, others, are, omnivores, feeding, on, larvae, worms, roots, and, grasses, and, others, like, the, southern, mole, cricket, are, mainly, predacious, they, leave, their, burrows, at, night, to, forage, for, leaves, and, stems, which, they, drag, underground, before, consumption, as, well, as, consuming, roots, underground, besides, birds, toads, and, insectivorous, mammals, the, predators, of, mole, crickets, include, subterranean, assassin, bugs, wolf, spiders, and, various, beetles, the, south, american, nematode, steinernema, scapterisci, kills, neocapteriscus, mole, crickets, by, introducing, bacteria, into, their, bodies, causing, an, overwhelming, infection, steinernema, neocurtillae, is, native, to, florida, and, attacks, native, neocurtilla, hexadactyla, mole, crickets, parasitoid, wasps, of, the, genus, larra, hymenoptera, crabronidae, attack, mole, crickets, the,

fungal, microsporidian, and, viral, pathogens, have, been, identified, mole, crickets, evade, predators, by, living, below, ground, and, vigorously, burrowing, if, disturbed, at, the, surface, as, a, last, ditch, defence, they, eject, a, foul, smelling, brown, liquid, from, their, anal, glands, when, captured, they, can, also, bite, mole, crickets, are, relatively, common, but, because, they, are, nocturnal, and, spend, nearly, all, their, lives, under, ground, in, extensive, tunnel, systems, they, are, rarely, seen, they, inhabit, agricultural, fields, and, grassy, areas, they, are, present, in, every, continent, except, antarctica, by, 2014, 107, species, had, been, described, and, more, species, are, likely, to, be, discovered, especially, in, asia, neoscapteriscus, didactylus, is, a, pest, species, originating, in, south, america, it, has, spread, to, the, west, indies, and, new, south, wales, in, australia, gryllotalpa, africana, is, a, major, pest, in, south, africa, other, gryllotalpa, species, are, widely, distributed, in, europe, asia, and, australia, they, are, native, to, britain, as, to, western, europe, but, the, former, population, of, g, gryllotalpa, may, now, be, extinct, in, mainland, britain, surviving, in, the, channel, islands, invasive, species, are, those, that, cause, harm, in, their, newly, occupied, area, where, biological, control, may, be, attempted, the, first, detected, invasive, mole, cricket, species, was, neoscapteriscus, didactylus, a, south, american, species, reported, as, a, pest, in, st, vincent, west, indies, as, early, as, 1837, by, 1900, it, was, a, major, agricultural, pest, in, puerto, rico, it, had, probably, slowly, expanded, its, range, northwards, island, by, island, from, south, america, the, only, biological, control, program, against, n, didactylus, was, in, puerto, rico, and, it, succeeded, in, establishing, the, parasitoid, wasp, larra, bicolor, from, amazonian, brazil, in, 2001, n, didactylus, in, puerto, rico, seemed, to, be, a, pest, only, in, irrigated, crops, and, turf, small, scale, experimental, applications, of, the, nematode, steinernema, scapterisci, were, made, in, irrigated, turf, but, survival, of, the, nematode, was, poor, very, much, later, this, same, species, was, reported, as, a, pest, in, queensland, australia, presumably, arriving, by, ship, or, plane, the, next, detected, invasive, species, was, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, hawaii, probably, by, ship, it, was, named, as, gryllotalpa, africana, but, much, later, as, perhaps, g, orientalis, it, was, not, identified, as, gryllotalpa, krishnani, until, 2020, it, attacked, sugarcane, and, was, targeted, with, larra, polita, from, the, philippines, in, 1925, apparently, successfully, the, next, detection, was, in, georgia, usa, and, at, that, time, was, assumed, to, be, n, didactylus, from, the, west, indies, it, was, in, fact, three, south, american, neoscapteriscus, species, n, abbreviatus, n, vicinus, and, n, borellii, probably, having, arrived, in, ship, ballast, they, caused, major, problems, for, decades, as, they, spread, in, the, southeastern, usa, scapteriscus, mole, cricket, populations, had, built, up, since, the, early, decades, of, the, 20th, century, and, damaged, pastures, lawns, playing, fields, and, vegetable, crops, from, the, late, 1940s, chlordane, had, been, the, insecticide, of, choice, to, control, them, but, when, chlordane, was, banned, by, the, u, s, epa, in, the, 1970s, ranchers, were, left, with, no, economic, and, effective, control, method, especially, to, aid, florida, ranchers, a, project, that, became, known, as, the, uf, ifas, mole, cricket, research, program, was, initiated, in, 1978, in, 1985, a, multiple, authored, report, was, published, on, accomplishments, in, 1988, an, account, was, published, on, prospects, for, biological, control, and, in, 1996, an, account, of, promising, results, with, biological, control, the, program, ended, in, 2004, after, 25, years, of, running, monitoring, stations, and, in, 2006, a, summary, publication, announced, success, a, 95, reduction, in, mole, cricket, numbers, in, northern, florida, with, biological, control, agents, spreading, potentially, to, all, parts, of, florida, efforts, to, use, larra, bicolor, as, a, biological, control, agent, in, florida, began, by, importing, a, stock, from, puerto, rico, it, became, established, in, a, small, area, of, southeastern, florida, but, had, little, effect, on, neoscapteriscus, populations, a, stock, from, bolivia, became, established, in, northern, florida, and, spread, widely, with, some, help, to, most, of, the, rest, of, the, state, and, neighboring, states, its, survival, depends, upon, the, availability, of, suitable, nectar, sources, once, gravid, female, ormia, depleta, flies, were, found, to, be, attracted, to, the, song, of, neoscapteriscus, males, in, south, america, a, path, to, trap, these, flies, with, synthetic, mole, cricket, songs, was, opened, experimentation, then, led, to, a, rearing, method, laborious, rearing, of, over, 10, 000, flies, on, mole, cricket, hosts, allowed, releases, of, living, fly, pupae, at, many, sites, in, florida, from, the, far, northwest, to, the, far, south, mainly, on, golf, courses, and, mainly, in, 1989, 1991, populations, were, established, began, to, spread, and, were, monitored, by, use, of, synthetic, mole, cricket, song, eventually, the, flies, were, found, to, have, a, continuous, population, from, about, 29, n, then, south, to, miami, but, the, flies, failed, to, survive, the, winter, north, of, about, 29, n, shipment, and, release, of, the, flies, to, states, north, of, florida, was, thus, a, wasted, effort, as, the, flies, had, been, imported, from, 23, s, in, brazil, and, could, not, overwinter, north, of, 29, n, whether, flies, from, 30, s, in, brazil, might, survive, better, in, northern, florida, was, investigated, in, 1999, but, they, did, not, the, third, biological, control, agent, to, target, neoscapteriscus, in, florida, was, the, south, american, nematode, steinernema, scapterisci, small, scale, releases, proved, it, could, persist, for, years, in, mole, cricket, infested, sandy, florida, soils, its, use, as, a, biopesticide, against, neoscapteriscus, was, patented, making, it, attractive, to, industry, industrial, scale, production, on, artificial, diet, allowed, large, scale, trial, applications, in, pastures, and, on, golf, courses, which, succeeded, in, establishing, populations, in, several, counties, and, these, populations, spread, but, sales, were, disappointing, and, the, product, was, withdrawn, from, the, market, in, 2014, although, experimental, application, was, made, in, states, north, of, florida, only, in, southern, georgia, was, establishment, of, the, nematode, verified, suggesting, little, interest, in, the, other, states, the, main, damage, done, by, mole, crickets, is, as, a, result, of, their, burrowing, activities, as, they, tunnel, through, the, top, few, centimetres, of, soil, they, push, the, ground, up, in, little, ridges, increasing, evaporation, of, surface, moisture, disturbing, germinating, seeds, and, damaging, the, delicate, young, roots, of, seedlings, they, are, also, injurious, to, turf, and, pasture, grasses, as, they, feed, on, their, roots, leaving, the, plants, prone, to, drying, out, and, damage, by, use, in, their, native, lands, mole, crickets, have, natural, enemies, that, keep, them, under, control, this, is, not, the, case, when, they, have, been, accidentally, introduced, to, other, parts, of, the, world, in, florida, from, the, 1940s, through, the, 1980s, they, were, considered, pests, and, were, described, as, a, serious, problem, their, population, densities, have, since, declined, greatly, a, university, of, florida, entomology, report, suggests, that, south, american, neoscapteriscus, mole, crickets, may, have, entered, the, united, states, at, brunswick, georgia, in, ship, s, ballast, from, southern, south, america, around, 1899, but, were, at, that, time, mistakenly, believed, to, be, from, the, west, indies, one, possible, remedy, was, biological, pest, control, using, the, parasitoidal, wasps, larra, bicolor, another, remedy, that, has, been, successfully, applied, is, use, of, the, parasitic, nematode, steinernema, scapterisci, when, this, is, applied, in, strips, across, grassland, it, spreads, throughout, the, pasture, and, potentially, beyond, within, a, few, months, and, not, only, controls, the, mole, crickets, but, also, remains, infective, in, the, soil, for, future, years, in, zambia, gryllotalpa, africana, is, held, to, bring, good, fortune, to, anyone, who, sees, it, in, latin, america, scapteriscus, and, neocurtilla, mole, crickets, are, said, to, predict, rain, when, they, dig, into, the, ground, in, japan, in, the, past, they, seem, to, have, been, associated, with, the, worms, corpses, bugs, that, announce, a, person, s, sins, to, heaven, in, the, koshin, or, koushin, belief, gryllotalpa, mole, crickets, have, sometimes, been, used, as, food, in, west, java, and, vietnam, in, thailand, mole, crickets, thai, are, valued, as, food, in, isan, they, are, usually, eaten, fried, along, with, sticky, rice, in, the, philippines, they, are, served, as, a, delicacy, called, camaro, in, the, province, of, pampanga, and, are, a, tourist, attraction, they, are, also, served, in, parts, of, northern, luzon
