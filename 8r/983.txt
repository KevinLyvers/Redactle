the, primulaceae, p, r, m, j, l, e, i, commonly, known, as, the, primrose, family, but, not, related, to, the, evening, primrose, family, are, a, family, of, herbaceous, and, woody, flowering, plants, including, some, favourite, garden, plants, and, wildflowers, most, are, perennial, though, some, species, such, as, scarlet, pimpernel, are, annuals, previously, one, of, three, families, in, the, order, primulales, it, underwent, considerable, generic, re, alignment, once, molecular, phylogenetic, methods, were, used, for, taxonomic, classification, the, order, was, then, submerged, in, a, much, enlarged, order, ericales, and, became, a, greatly, enlarged, primulaceae, sensu, lato, s, l, in, this, new, classification, of, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, group, each, of, the, primulales, families, was, reduced, to, the, rank, of, subfamily, of, primulaceae, s, l, the, original, primulaceae, primulaceae, sensu, stricto, or, s, s, then, became, subfamily, primuloideae, and, one, genus, maesa, was, raised, to, the, rank, of, a, separate, subfamily, making, four, in, all, the, family, shares, a, number, of, characteristics, including, haplostemonous, flowers, having, the, same, number, of, petals, and, stamens, sympetalous, corolla, having, the, petals, united, stamens, opposite, the, petals, free, central, placentation, bitegmic, two, layered, ovules, and, nuclear, endosperm, formation, primulaceae, are, mostly, herbaceous, having, no, woody, stem, except, that, some, form, cushions, spreading, mats, a, few, inches, high, and, their, stems, are, stiffened, by, lignin, the, stems, can, grow, upright, erect, or, spread, out, horizontally, and, then, turn, upright, decumbent, leaves, are, simple, being, directly, attached, to, the, stem, by, a, petiole, stalk, but, unlike, the, leaves, of, most, flowering, plants, they, have, no, stipules, the, petiole, is, short, or, the, leaf, tapers, gradually, towards, the, base, leaf, arrangement, is, typically, alternate, but, some, are, opposite, or, whorled, and, there, is, generally, a, rosette, at, the, base, of, the, stem, the, edges, are, toothed, dentate, or, sawtoothed, new, leaves, in, the, bud, are, usually, involute, rolled, towards, the, upper, surface, or, conduplicate, folded, upwards, but, a, few, species, roll, downwards, each, flower, is, bisexual, having, both, stamens, and, carpels, they, have, radial, symmetry, the, petals, can, be, separate, or, partially, or, fully, fused, together, to, form, a, tube, shaped, corolla, that, opens, up, at, the, mouth, to, form, a, bell, like, shape, as, in, item, 8, in, the, figure, or, a, flat, faced, flower, in, most, of, the, families, of, ericales, stamens, alternate, with, lobes, but, in, primulaceae, there, is, a, stamen, opposite, each, petal, the, calyx, has, 4, to, 9, lobes, and, persists, after, flowering, they, are, grouped, in, unbranched, indeterminate, clusters, such, as, racemes, spikes, corymbs, or, umbels, the, fruit, of, primulaceae, begins, as, an, ovary, and, inside, it, are, the, future, seeds, ovules, these, are, attached, to, a, central, axis, without, any, partitions, between, them, an, arrangement, called, free, central, placentation, see, item, 7, in, the, figure, and, they, are, bitegmic, having, a, double, protective, layer, around, each, ovule, unlike, in, most, other, families, of, ericales, both, layers, form, the, opening, at, the, top, the, micropyle, as, seeds, develop, an, endosperm, grows, around, the, embryo, through, free, division, of, nuclei, without, forming, walls, nuclear, endosperm, formation, the, embryo, forms, a, pair, of, short, narrow, cotyledons, item, 10, in, the, figure, usually, multiple, seeds, are, in, a, capsule, that, is, carried, on, a, straight, stalk, pedicel, or, scape, after, it, matures, it, splits, apart, releasing, the, seeds, ballistically, the, taxonomic, history, of, primulaceae, has, been, long, and, complex, the, botanical, authority, for, the, family, name, is, given, to, august, batsch, 1794, as, batsch, ex, borkh, using, the, term, primulae, with, six, genera, the, valid, description, being, subsequently, given, by, borkhausen, 1797, some, earlier, authors, attributed, the, name, to, ventenat, 1799, as, primulaceae, vent, who, described, the, primulac, es, but, batsch, had, precedence, linnaeus, 1753, placed, primula, and, related, primuloid, genera, in, the, hexandria, monogynia, six, stamens, one, pistil, in, his, sexual, classification, based, on, reproductive, characteristics, jussieu, arranged, linnaeus, genera, in, a, hierarchical, system, of, ranks, based, on, the, relative, value, of, a, much, wider, range, of, characteristics, in, his, genera, plantarum, 1789, he, organised, the, primuloid, genera, into, two, ordo, families, within, a, class, viii, he, called, dicotyledones, monopetalae, corolla, hypogyna, based, on, the, cotyledons, two, form, of, the, petals, fused, and, position, of, the, corolla, with, respect, to, the, ovary, below, jussieu, s, families, were, the, lysimachiae, including, primula, and, theophrasta, and, the, sapotae, including, myrsine, these, being, the, three, main, lineages, in, modern, understanding, the, most, complete, treatment, of, the, primulaceae, family, with, nearly, 1, 000, species, arranged, into, 22, genera, was, by, pax, and, knuth, in, 1905, in, the, engler, system, they, divided, the, family, into, five, tribes, and, several, subtribes, androsaceae, cyclamineae, lysimachieae, samoleae, and, corideae, many, systems, since, have, lacked, consistency, but, generally, recognised, two, major, groups, as, either, tribes, or, subfamilies, the, lysimachieae, and, primuleae, the, androsaceae, of, pax, and, knuth, with, the, largest, genera, being, primula, lysimachia, and, androsace, in, the, cronquist, system, 1988, cronquist, included, the, three, closely, related, families, primulaceae, myrsinaceae, and, theophrastaceae, in, the, order, primulales, of, subclass, dilleniidae, based, on, morphological, characteristics, in, particular, ovaries, with, free, central, placentation, a, feature, considered, synapomorphic, his, circumscription, of, primulaceae, included, about, 800, species, these, three, families, were, referred, to, as, the, primuloid, families, with, the, later, development, of, molecular, phylogenetic, methods, the, primulales, were, found, to, be, more, closely, related, to, other, families, within, the, ericales, and, the, three, primuloid, families, were, subsequently, absorbed, into, an, expanded, ericales, ericales, sensu, lato, or, s, l, making, 24, families, within, that, order, where, the, primuloids, formed, a, monophyletic, clade, it, was, also, apparent, that, myrsinaceae, were, paraphyletic, unless, the, genus, maesa, was, segregated, and, elevated, to, become, a, new, monogeneric, family, maesaceae, but, also, that, primulaceae, were, probably, paraphyletic, in, the, first, consensus, taxonomic, classification, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, group, apg, 1998, these, proposals, were, recognised, by, including, primulaceae, within, ericales, as, eudicots, forming, one, of, three, clades, in, the, asterids, asteridae, maesa, was, formally, segregated, in, 2000, further, changes, came, from, analysis, of, dna, sequence, data, this, led, to, the, move, of, genera, primarily, terrestrial, non, basal, rosette, from, primulaceae, to, mysinaceae, and, theophrastaceae, at, that, time, primulaceae, was, considered, to, consist, of, nine, tribes, primuleae, androsaceae, ardisiandreae, lysimachieae, glauceae, anagallideae, corideae, cyclamineae, and, samoleae, notably, lysimachieae, and, three, smaller, tribes, corideae, cyclamineae, and, ardisiandreae, were, transferred, to, myrsinaceae, and, samoleae, to, theophrastaceae, this, enlarged, myrsinaceae, is, distinguished, as, myrsinaceae, s, l, in, comparison, to, the, previous, smaller, family, myrsinaceae, s, s, less, maesa, some, authors, preferred, to, raise, samoleae, to, its, own, family, samolaceae, but, this, has, not, been, accepted, by, subsequent, authors, placing, it, within, theophrastaceae, while, recognising, its, distinct, position, within, that, grouping, these, transfers, to, preserve, monophyly, at, the, family, level, essentially, left, two, tribes, remaining, in, primulaceae, the, primuleae, and, androsaceae, with, about, 15, genera, sharing, a, number, of, common, characteristics, these, additional, changes, were, reflected, in, the, 2003, revision, of, the, apg, system, apg, ii, where, the, now, four, primuloid, families, were, among, 23, in, ericales, this, restricted, primulaceae, sensu, stricto, s, s, consisted, of, three, groups, the, primulae, including, primula, the, largest, genus, the, androsaceae, including, androsace, the, second, largest, genus, together, with, a, small, third, group, containing, soldanella, hottonia, omphalogramma, and, bryocarpum, the, apg, third, classification, system, apg, iii, 2009, discussed, all, the, taxonomic, challenges, arising, from, the, phylogenetic, studies, and, placed, all, primuloid, genera, into, one, large, primulaceae, s, l, corresponding, to, cronquist, s, primulales, they, stated, that, the, biggest, problem, for, apg, iii, was, the, question, of, how, to, treat, primulaceae, and, their, immediate, relatives, a, closely, related, group, that, in, the, past, has, often, been, recognized, as, a, separate, order, the, decision, to, treat, all, genera, as, a, single, family, was, based, on, the, observation, that, the, new, circumscriptions, had, little, in, the, way, of, apomorphies, but, the, entire, group, had, numerous, synapomorphies, and, were, easy, to, recognise, this, resulted, in, an, ericales, with, 22, families, consequently, the, four, primuloid, families, were, reduced, to, the, rank, of, subfamilies, within, primulaceae, s, l, primulaceae, s, l, sensu, apg, iii, form, part, of, the, speciose, species, rich, asterid, order, ericales, s, l, with, about, 12, 000, species, and, 22, families, as, per, apg, iv, ericales, is, one, of, four, major, clades, within, the, asterids, where, it, is, sister, to, the, euasterids, the, phylogenetic, structure, of, ericales, as, shown, in, the, following, cladogram, consists, of, seven, major, suprafamilial, clades, e, g, balsaminoids, styracoids, and, a, group, of, core, ericales, within, the, eracalean, families, primulaceae, s, l, is, shown, as, a, sister, group, to, ebenaceae, and, both, are, sister, to, sapotaceae, these, three, families, make, up, the, primuloid, clade, the, fossil, record, of, primulaceae, s, l, is, sparse, but, the, crown, group, has, been, estimated, as, c, 46, 61, million, years, old, the, crown, primuloids, have, been, dated, to, c, 102, mya, with, primulaceae, ebenaceae, divergence, at, 80, mya, crown, ages, for, the, primulaceae, subfamilies, vary, from, 24, mya, for, the, maesoideae, the, basal, group, to, 70, mya, for, the, theophrastoideae, the, primuloids, probably, originated, in, a, shared, neotropical, indo, malaysian, ancestral, range, with, the, primulaceae, ebenaceae, clade, occupying, the, neotropics, theophrastoideae, is, nearly, all, neotropical, with, a, more, recent, migration, out, of, the, realm, found, in, the, aquatic, samolus, genus, the, divergence, between, theophrastoideae, and, primuloideae, myrsinoideae, at, 70, mya, represents, a, vicariant, event, between, the, neotropics, and, the, palearctic, in, the, case, of, the, latter, the, primuloideae, originating, in, the, palearctic, persisted, till, the, last, 16, mya, when, it, started, to, shift, into, the, nearctic, the, three, former, families, of, the,
