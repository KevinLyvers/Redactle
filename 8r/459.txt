acanthodii, or, acanthodians, is, an, extinct, class, of, gnathostomes, jawed, fishes, they, are, currently, considered, to, represent, a, paraphyletic, grade, of, various, fish, lineages, basal, to, extant, chondrichthyes, which, includes, living, sharks, rays, and, chimaeras, acanthodians, possess, a, mosaic, of, features, shared, with, both, osteichthyans, bony, fish, and, chondrichthyans, cartilaginous, fish, in, general, body, shape, they, were, similar, to, modern, sharks, but, their, epidermis, was, covered, with, tiny, rhomboid, platelets, like, the, scales, of, holosteians, gars, bowfins, the, popular, name, spiny, sharks, is, because, they, were, superficially, shark, shaped, with, a, streamlined, body, paired, fins, a, strongly, upturned, tail, and, stout, largely, immovable, bony, spines, supporting, all, the, fins, except, the, tail, hence, spiny, sharks, however, acanthodians, are, not, true, sharks, their, close, relation, to, modern, cartilaginous, fish, can, lead, them, to, be, considered, stem, sharks, acanthodians, had, a, cartilaginous, skeleton, but, their, fins, had, a, wide, bony, base, and, were, reinforced, on, their, anterior, margin, with, a, dentine, spine, as, a, result, fossilized, spines, and, scales, are, often, all, that, remains, of, these, fishes, in, ancient, sedimentary, rocks, the, earliest, acanthodians, were, marine, but, during, the, devonian, freshwater, species, became, predominant, acanthodians, have, been, divided, into, four, orders, acanthodiformes, climatiiformes, diplacanthiformes, and, ischnacanthiformes, climatiiformes, is, a, paraphyletic, assemblage, of, early, acanthodians, such, as, climatiids, gyracanthids, and, diplacanthids, they, had, robust, bony, shoulder, girdles, and, many, small, sharp, spines, intermediate, or, prepelvic, spines, between, the, pectoral, and, pelvic, fins, the, climatiiform, subgroup, diplacanthida, has, subsequently, been, elevated, to, its, own, order, diplacanthiformes, ischnacanthiforms, were, predators, with, tooth, plates, fused, to, their, jaws, acanthodiforms, were, filter, feeders, with, a, single, dorsal, fin, toothless, jaws, and, long, gill, rakers, they, were, the, last, and, most, specialized, off, the, traditional, acanthodians, as, they, survived, up, until, the, permian, period, the, scales, of, acanthodii, have, distinctive, ornamentation, peculiar, to, each, order, because, of, this, the, scales, are, often, used, in, determining, relative, age, of, sedimentary, rock, the, scales, are, tiny, with, a, bulbous, base, a, neck, and, a, flat, or, slightly, curved, diamond, shaped, crown, despite, being, called, spiny, sharks, acanthodians, predate, sharks, scales, that, have, been, tentatively, identified, as, belonging, to, acanthodians, or, shark, like, fishes, have, been, found, in, various, ordovician, strata, though, they, are, ambiguous, and, may, actually, belong, to, jawless, fishes, such, as, thelodonts, the, earliest, unequivocal, acanthodian, fossils, date, from, the, beginning, of, the, silurian, period, some, 50, million, years, before, the, first, sharks, appeared, later, the, acanthodians, colonized, fresh, waters, and, thrived, in, the, rivers, and, lakes, during, the, devonian, and, in, the, coal, swamps, of, carboniferous, by, this, time, bony, fishes, were, already, showing, their, potential, to, dominate, the, waters, of, the, world, and, their, competition, proved, too, much, for, the, spiny, sharks, which, died, out, in, permian, times, approximately, 250, million, years, ago, many, palaeontologists, originally, considered, the, acanthodians, close, to, the, ancestors, of, the, bony, fishes, although, their, interior, skeletons, were, made, of, cartilage, a, bonelike, material, had, developed, in, the, skins, of, these, fishes, in, the, form, of, closely, fitting, scales, see, above, some, scales, were, greatly, enlarged, and, formed, a, bony, covering, on, top, of, the, head, and, over, the, lower, shoulder, girdle, others, developed, a, bony, flap, over, the, gill, openings, analogous, to, the, operculum, in, later, bony, fishes, however, most, of, these, characteristics, are, considered, homologous, characteristics, derived, from, common, placoderm, ancestors, and, present, also, in, basal, cartilaginous, fish, overall, the, acanthodians, jaws, are, presumed, to, have, evolved, from, the, first, gill, arch, of, some, ancestral, jawless, fishes, that, had, a, gill, skeleton, made, of, pieces, of, jointed, cartilage, in, a, study, of, early, jawed, vertebrate, relationships, davis, et, al, 2012, found, acanthodians, to, be, split, among, the, two, major, clades, osteichthyes, bony, fish, and, chondrichthyes, cartilaginous, fish, the, well, known, acanthodian, acanthodes, was, placed, within, osteichthyes, despite, the, presence, of, many, chondrichthyan, characteristics, in, its, braincase, however, a, newly, described, silurian, placoderm, entelognathus, which, has, jaw, anatomy, shared, with, bony, fish, and, tetrapods, has, led, to, revisions, of, this, phylogeny, acanthodians, were, then, considered, to, be, a, paraphyletic, assemblage, leading, to, cartilaginous, fish, while, bony, fish, evolved, from, placoderm, ancestors, burrow, et, al, 2016, provides, vindication, by, finding, chondrichthyans, to, be, nested, among, acanthodii, most, closely, related, to, doliodus, and, tamiobatis, a, 2017, study, of, doliodus, morphology, points, out, that, it, appears, to, display, a, mosaic, of, shark, and, acanthodian, features, making, it, a, transitional, fossil, and, further, reinforcing, this, idea, phylogeny, after, galeaspida, osteostraci, placodermi, osteichthyes, tetanopsyrus, nerepisacanthus, ischnacanthus, poracanthodes, culmacanthus, uraniacanthus, diplacanthus, rhadinacanthus, cassidiceps, mesacanthus, lodeacanthus, triazeugacanthus, promesacanthus, acanthodes, cheiracanthus, homalacanthus, euthacanthus, ptomacanthus, brachyacanthus, climatius, parexus, vernicomacanthus, lupopsyrus, obtusacanthus, kathemacanthus, brochoadmones, gyracanthides, chondrichthyes, conventionally, defined, the, oldest, remains, attributed, acanthodian, grade, chondrichthyans, are, fanjingshania, and, qianodus, from, the, early, silurian, of, china, dating, to, around, 439, million, years, ago, compared, to, other, contemporary, groups, of, fish, acanthodians, were, relatively, morphologically, and, ecologically, conservative, acanthodians, rose, in, diversity, during, the, late, silurian, reaching, their, apex, of, diversity, during, the, lochkovian, stage, of, the, early, devonian, declining, during, the, pragian, but, rising, again, during, the, following, emsian, which, was, followed, by, a, decline, in, diversity, during, middle, late, devonian, the, diversity, of, the, group, was, consistently, low, but, stable, during, the, carboniferous, slightly, decreasing, going, into, the, permian, the, youngest, records, of, the, group, are, isolated, scales, and, fin, spines, from, middle, late, permian, strata, in, the, paran, basin, of, brazil
