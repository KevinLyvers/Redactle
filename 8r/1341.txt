flexibility, balance, mood, memory, exercise, tolerance, fear, of, falling, injuries, and, death, it, may, be, both, safe, and, effective, in, improving, physical, and, possibly, mental, state, while, reducing, disability, with, few, adverse, events, the, current, body, of, evidence, suggests, that, physical, rehabilitation, may, be, effective, for, long, term, care, residents, in, reducing, disability, with, few, adverse, events, however, there, is, insufficient, to, conclude, whether, the, beneficial, effects, are, sustainable, and, cost, effective, the, findings, are, based, on,
