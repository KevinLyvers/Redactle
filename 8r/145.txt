in, botany, a, fruit, is, the, seed, bearing, structure, in, flowering, plants, that, is, formed, from, the, ovary, after, flowering, see, fruit, anatomy, fruits, are, the, means, by, which, flowering, plants, also, known, as, angiosperms, disseminate, their, seeds, edible, fruits, in, particular, have, long, propagated, using, the, movements, of, humans, and, other, animals, in, a, symbiotic, relationship, that, is, the, means, for, seed, dispersal, for, the, one, group, and, nutrition, for, the, other, humans, and, many, other, animals, have, become, dependent, on, fruits, as, a, source, of, food, consequently, fruits, account, for, a, substantial, fraction, of, the, world, s, agricultural, output, and, some, such, as, the, apple, and, the, pomegranate, have, acquired, extensive, cultural, and, symbolic, meanings, in, common, language, usage, fruit, normally, means, the, seed, associated, fleshy, structures, or, produce, of, plants, that, typically, are, sweet, or, sour, and, edible, in, the, raw, state, such, as, apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and, strawberries, in, botanical, usage, the, term, fruit, also, includes, many, structures, that, are, not, commonly, called, fruits, in, everyday, language, such, as, nuts, bean, pods, corn, kernels, tomatoes, and, wheat, grains, many, common, language, terms, used, for, fruit, and, seeds, differ, from, botanical, classifications, for, example, in, botany, a, fruit, is, a, ripened, ovary, or, carpel, that, contains, seeds, e, g, an, orange, pomegranate, tomato, or, a, pumpkin, a, nut, is, a, type, of, fruit, and, not, a, seed, and, a, seed, is, a, ripened, ovule, in, culinary, language, a, fruit, is, the, sweet, or, not, sweet, even, sour, tasting, produce, of, a, specific, plant, e, g, a, peach, pear, or, lemon, nuts, are, hard, oily, non, sweet, plant, produce, in, shells, hazelnut, acorn, vegetables, so, called, typically, are, savory, or, non, sweet, produce, zucchini, lettuce, broccoli, and, tomato, but, some, may, be, sweet, tasting, sweet, potato, examples, of, botanically, classified, fruit, that, are, typically, called, vegetables, include, cucumber, pumpkin, and, squash, all, are, cucurbits, beans, peanuts, and, peas, all, legumes, and, corn, eggplant, bell, pepper, or, sweet, pepper, and, tomato, many, spices, are, fruits, botanically, speaking, including, black, pepper, chili, pepper, cumin, and, allspice, in, contrast, rhubarb, is, often, called, a, fruit, when, used, in, making, pies, but, the, edible, produce, of, rhubarb, is, actually, the, leaf, stalk, or, petiole, of, the, plant, edible, gymnosperm, seeds, are, often, given, fruit, names, e, g, ginkgo, nuts, and, pine, nuts, botanically, a, cereal, grain, such, as, corn, rice, or, wheat, is, a, kind, of, fruit, termed, a, caryopsis, however, the, fruit, wall, is, thin, and, fused, to, the, seed, coat, so, almost, all, the, edible, grain, fruit, is, actually, a, seed, the, outer, layer, often, edible, of, most, fruits, is, called, the, pericarp, typically, formed, from, the, ovary, it, surrounds, the, seeds, in, some, species, however, other, structural, tissues, contribute, to, or, form, the, edible, portion, the, pericarp, may, be, described, in, three, layers, from, outer, to, inner, i, e, the, epicarp, mesocarp, and, endocarp, fruit, that, bears, a, prominent, pointed, terminal, projection, is, said, to, be, beaked, a, fruit, results, from, the, fertilizing, and, maturing, of, one, or, more, flowers, the, gynoecium, which, contains, the, stigma, style, ovary, system, is, centered, in, the, flower, head, and, it, forms, all, or, part, of, the, fruit, inside, the, ovary, ies, are, one, or, more, ovules, here, begins, a, complex, sequence, called, double, fertilization, a, female, gametophyte, produces, an, egg, cell, for, the, purpose, of, fertilization, a, female, gametophyte, is, called, a, megagametophyte, and, also, called, the, embryo, sac, after, double, fertilization, the, ovules, will, become, seeds, ovules, are, fertilized, in, a, process, that, starts, with, pollination, which, is, the, movement, of, pollen, from, the, stamens, to, the, stigma, style, ovary, system, within, the, flower, head, after, pollination, a, pollen, tube, grows, from, the, deposited, pollen, through, the, stigma, down, the, style, into, the, ovary, to, the, ovule, two, sperm, are, transferred, from, the, pollen, to, a, megagametophyte, within, the, megagametophyte, one, sperm, unites, with, the, egg, forming, a, zygote, while, the, second, sperm, enters, the, central, cell, forming, the, endosperm, mother, cell, which, completes, the, double, fertilization, process, later, the, zygote, will, give, rise, to, the, embryo, of, the, seed, and, the, endosperm, mother, cell, will, give, rise, to, endosperm, a, nutritive, tissue, used, by, the, embryo, as, the, ovules, develop, into, seeds, the, ovary, begins, to, ripen, and, the, ovary, wall, the, pericarp, may, become, fleshy, as, in, berries, or, drupes, or, it, may, form, a, hard, outer, covering, as, in, nuts, in, some, multi, seeded, fruits, the, extent, to, which, a, fleshy, structure, develops, is, proportional, to, the, number, of, fertilized, ovules, the, pericarp, typically, is, differentiated, into, two, or, three, distinct, layers, these, are, called, the, exocarp, outer, layer, also, called, epicarp, mesocarp, middle, layer, and, endocarp, inner, layer, in, some, fruits, the, sepals, petals, stamens, or, the, style, of, the, flower, fall, away, as, the, fleshy, fruit, ripens, however, for, simple, fruits, derived, from, an, inferior, ovary, i, e, one, that, lies, below, the, attachment, of, other, floral, parts, there, are, parts, including, petals, sepals, and, stamens, that, fuse, with, the, ovary, and, ripen, with, it, for, such, a, case, when, floral, parts, other, than, the, ovary, form, a, significant, part, of, the, fruit, that, develops, it, is, called, an, accessory, fruit, examples, of, accessory, fruits, include, apple, rose, hip, strawberry, and, pineapple, because, several, parts, of, the, flower, besides, the, ovary, may, contribute, to, the, structure, of, a, fruit, it, is, important, to, understand, how, a, particular, fruit, forms, there, are, three, general, modes, of, fruit, development, consistent, with, the, three, modes, of, fruit, development, plant, scientists, have, classified, fruits, into, three, main, groups, simple, fruits, aggregate, fruits, and, multiple, or, composite, fruits, the, groupings, reflect, how, the, ovary, and, other, flower, organs, are, arranged, and, how, the, fruits, develop, but, they, are, not, evolutionarily, relevant, as, diverse, plant, taxa, may, be, in, the, same, group, while, the, section, of, a, fungus, that, produces, spores, is, called, a, fruiting, body, fungi, are, members, of, the, fungi, kingdom, and, not, of, the, plant, kingdom, simple, fruits, are, the, result, of, the, ripening, to, fruit, of, a, simple, or, compound, ovary, in, a, single, flower, with, a, single, pistil, in, contrast, a, single, flower, with, numerous, pistils, typically, produces, an, aggregate, fruit, and, the, merging, of, several, flowers, or, a, multiple, of, flowers, results, in, a, multiple, fruit, a, simple, fruit, is, further, classified, as, either, dry, or, fleshy, to, distribute, their, seeds, dry, fruits, may, split, open, and, discharge, their, seeds, to, the, winds, which, is, called, dehiscence, or, the, distribution, process, may, rely, upon, the, decay, and, degradation, of, the, fruit, to, expose, the, seeds, or, it, may, rely, upon, the, eating, of, fruit, and, excreting, of, seeds, by, frugivores, both, are, called, indehiscence, fleshy, fruits, do, not, split, open, but, they, also, are, indehiscent, and, they, may, also, rely, on, frugivores, for, distribution, of, their, seeds, typically, the, entire, outer, layer, of, the, ovary, wall, ripens, into, a, potentially, edible, pericarp, types, of, dry, simple, fruits, with, examples, include, fruits, in, which, part, or, all, of, the, pericarp, fruit, wall, is, fleshy, at, maturity, are, termed, fleshy, simple, fruits, types, of, fleshy, simple, fruits, with, examples, include, berries, are, a, type, of, simple, fleshy, fruit, that, issue, from, a, single, ovary, the, ovary, itself, may, be, compound, with, several, carpels, the, botanical, term, true, berry, includes, grapes, currants, cucumbers, eggplants, aubergines, tomatoes, chili, peppers, and, bananas, but, excludes, certain, fruits, that, are, called, berry, by, culinary, custom, or, by, common, usage, of, the, term, such, as, strawberries, and, raspberries, berries, may, be, formed, from, one, or, more, carpels, i, e, from, the, simple, or, compound, ovary, from, the, same, single, flower, seeds, typically, are, embedded, in, the, fleshy, interior, of, the, ovary, examples, include, the, strawberry, regardless, of, its, appearance, is, classified, as, a, dry, not, a, fleshy, fruit, botanically, it, is, not, a, berry, it, is, an, aggregate, accessory, fruit, the, latter, term, meaning, the, fleshy, part, is, derived, not, from, the, plant, s, ovaries, but, from, the, receptacle, that, holds, the, ovaries, numerous, dry, achenes, are, attached, to, the, outside, of, the, fruit, flesh, they, appear, to, be, seeds, but, each, is, actually, an, ovary, of, a, flower, with, a, seed, inside, schizocarps, are, dry, fruits, though, some, appear, to, be, fleshy, they, originate, from, syncarpous, ovaries, but, do, not, actually, dehisce, rather, they, split, into, segments, with, one, or, more, seeds, they, include, a, number, of, different, forms, from, a, wide, range, of, families, including, carrot, parsnip, parsley, cumin, an, aggregate, fruit, is, also, called, an, aggregation, or, etaerio, it, develops, from, a, single, flower, that, presents, numerous, simple, pistils, each, pistil, contains, one, carpel, together, they, form, a, fruitlet, the, ultimate, fruiting, development, of, the, aggregation, of, pistils, is, called, an, aggregate, fruit, etaerio, fruit, or, simply, an, etaerio, different, types, of, aggregate, fruits, can, produce, different, etaerios, such, as, achenes, drupelets, follicles, and, berries, some, other, broadly, recognized, species, and, their, etaerios, or, aggregations, are, the, pistils, of, the, raspberry, are, called, drupelets, because, each, pistil, is, like, a, small, drupe, attached, to, the, receptacle, in, some, bramble, fruits, such, as, blackberry, the, receptacle, an, accessory, part, elongates, and, then, develops, as, part, of, the, fruit, making, the, blackberry, an, aggregate, accessory, fruit, the, strawberry, is, also, an, aggregate, accessory, fruit, of, which, the, seeds, are, contained, in, the, achenes, notably, in, all, these, examples, the, fruit, develops, from, a, single, flower, with, numerous, pistils, a, multiple, fruit, is, formed, from, a, cluster, of, flowers, a, multiple, of, flowers, also, called, an, inflorescence, each, smallish, flower, produces, a, single, fruitlet, which, as, all, develop, all, merge, into, one, mass, of, fruit, examples, include, pineapple, fig, mulberry, osage, orange, and, breadfruit, an, inflorescence, a, cluster, of, white, flowers, called, a, head, is, produced, first, after, fertilization, each, flower, in, the, cluster, develops, into, a, drupe, as, the, drupes, expand, they, develop, as, a, connate, organ, merging, into, a, multiple, fleshy, fruit, called, a, syncarp, progressive, stages, of, multiple, flowering, and, fruit, development, can, be, observed, on, a, single, branch, of, the, indian, mulberry, or, noni, during, the, sequence, of, development, a, progression, of, second, third, and, more, inflorescences, are, initiated, in, turn, at, the, head, of, the, branch, or, stem, fruits, may, incorporate, tissues, derived, from, other, floral, parts, besides, the, ovary, including, the, receptacle, hypanthium, petals, or, sepals, accessory, fruits, occur, in, all, three, classes, of, fruit, development, simple, aggregate, and, multiple, accessory, fruits, are, frequently, designated, by, the, hyphenated, term, showing, both, characters, for, example, a, pineapple, is, a, multiple, accessory, fruit, a, blackberry, is, an, aggregate, accessory, fruit, and, an, apple, is, a, simple, accessory, fruit, seedlessness, is, an, important, feature, of, some, fruits, of, commerce, commercial, cultivars, of, bananas, and, pineapples, are, examples, of, seedless, fruits, some, cultivars, of, citrus, fruits, especially, grapefruit, mandarin, oranges, navel, oranges, satsumas, table, grapes, and, of, watermelons, are, valued, for, their, seedlessness, in, some, species, seedlessness, is, the, result, of, parthenocarpy, where, fruits, set, without, fertilization, parthenocarpic, fruit, set, may, or, may, not, require, pollination, but, most, seedless, citrus, fruits, require, a, stimulus, from, pollination, to, produce, fruit, seedless, bananas, and, grapes, are, triploids, and, seedlessness, results, from, the, abortion, of, the, embryonic, plant, that, is, produced, by, fertilization, a, phenomenon, known, as, stenospermocarpy, which, requires, normal, pollination, and, fertilization, variations, in, fruit, structures, largely, depend, on, the, modes, of, dispersal, applied, to, their, seeds, dispersal, is, achieved, by, wind, or, water, by, explosive, dehiscence, and, by, interactions, with, animals, some, fruits, present, their, outer, skins, or, shells, coated, with, spikes, or, hooked, burrs, these, evolved, either, to, deter, would, be, foragers, from, feeding, on, them, or, to, serve, to, attach, themselves, to, the, hair, feathers, legs, or, clothing, of, animals, thereby, using, them, as, dispersal, agents, these, plants, are, termed, zoochorous, common, examples, include, cocklebur, unicorn, plant, and, beggarticks, or, spanish, needle, by, developments, of, mutual, evolution, the, fleshy, produce, of, fruits, typically, appeals, to, hungry, animals, such, that, the, seeds, contained, within, are, taken, in, carried, away, and, later, deposited, i, e, defecated, at, a, distance, from, the, parent, plant, likewise, the, nutritious, oily, kernels, of, nuts, typically, motivate, birds, and, squirrels, to, hoard, them, burying, them, in, soil, to, retrieve, later, during, the, winter, of, scarcity, thereby, uneaten, seeds, are, sown, effectively, under, natural, conditions, to, germinate, and, grow, a, new, plant, some, distance, away, from, the, parent, other, fruits, have, evolved, flattened, and, elongated, wings, or, helicopter, like, blades, e, g, elm, maple, and, tuliptree, this, mechanism, increases, dispersal, distance, away, from, the, parent, via, wind, other, wind, dispersed, fruit, have, tiny, parachutes, e, g, dandelion, milkweed, salsify, coconut, fruits, can, float, thousands, of, miles, in, the, ocean, thereby, spreading, their, seeds, other, fruits, that, can, disperse, via, water, are, nipa, palm, and, screw, pine, some, fruits, have, evolved, propulsive, mechanisms, that, fling, seeds, substantial, distances, perhaps, up, to, 100, m, 330, ft, in, the, case, of, the, sandbox, tree, via, explosive, dehiscence, or, other, such, mechanisms, see, impatiens, and, squirting, cucumber, a, cornucopia, of, fruits, fleshy, simple, fruits, from, apples, to, berries, to, watermelon, dry, simple, fruits, including, beans, and, rice, and, coconuts, aggregate, fruits, including, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, pawpaw, and, multiple, fruits, such, as, pineapple, fig, mulberries, are, commercially, valuable, as, human, food, they, are, eaten, both, fresh, and, as, jams, marmalade, and, other, fruit, preserves, they, are, used, extensively, in, manufactured, and, processed, foods, cakes, cookies, baked, goods, flavorings, ice, cream, yogurt, canned, vegetables, frozen, vegetables, and, meals, and, beverages, such, as, fruit, juices, and, alcoholic, beverages, brandy, fruit, beer, wine, spices, like, vanilla, black, pepper, paprika, and, allspice, are, derived, from, berries, olive, fruit, is, pressed, for, olive, oil, and, similar, processing, is, applied, to, other, oil, bearing, fruits, and, vegetables, some, fruits, are, available, all, year, round, while, others, such, as, blackberries, and, apricots, in, the, uk, are, subject, to, seasonal, availability, fruits, are, also, used, for, socializing, and, gift, giving, in, the, form, of, fruit, baskets, and, fruit, bouquets, typically, many, botanical, fruits, vegetables, in, culinary, parlance, including, tomato, green, beans, leaf, greens, bell, pepper, cucumber, eggplant, okra, pumpkin, squash, zucchini, are, bought, and, sold, daily, in, fresh, produce, markets, and, greengroceries, and, carried, back, to, kitchens, at, home, or, restaurant, for, preparation, of, meals, all, fruits, benefit, from, proper, post, harvest, care, and, in, many, fruits, the, plant, hormone, ethylene, causes, ripening, therefore, maintaining, most, fruits, in, an, efficient, cold, chain, is, optimal, for, post, harvest, storage, with, the, aim, of, extending, and, ensuring, shelf, life, various, culinary, fruits, provide, significant, amounts, of, fiber, and, water, and, many, are, generally, high, in, vitamin, c, an, overview, of, numerous, studies, showed, that, fruits, e, g, whole, apples, or, whole, oranges, are, satisfying, filling, by, simply, eating, and, chewing, them, the, dietary, fiber, consumed, in, eating, fruit, promotes, satiety, and, may, help, to, control, body, weight, and, aid, reduction, of, blood, cholesterol, a, risk, factor, for, cardiovascular, diseases, fruit, consumption, is, under, preliminary, research, for, the, potential, to, improve, nutrition, and, affect, chronic, diseases, regular, consumption, of, fruit, is, generally, associated, with, reduced, risks, of, several, diseases, and, functional, declines, associated, with, aging, for, food, safety, the, cdc, recommends, proper, fruit, handling, and, preparation, to, reduce, the, risk, of, food, contamination, and, foodborne, illness, fresh, fruits, and, vegetables, should, be, carefully, selected, at, the, store, they, should, not, be, damaged, or, bruised, and, precut, pieces, should, be, refrigerated, or, surrounded, by, ice, all, fruits, and, vegetables, should, be, rinsed, before, eating, this, recommendation, also, applies, to, produce, with, rinds, or, skins, that, are, not, eaten, it, should, be, done, just, before, preparing, or, eating, to, avoid, premature, spoilage, fruits, and, vegetables, should, be, kept, separate, from, raw, foods, like, meat, poultry, and, seafood, as, well, as, from, utensils, that, have, come, in, contact, with, raw, foods, fruits, and, vegetables, that, are, not, going, to, be, cooked, should, be, thrown, away, if, they, have, touched, raw, meat, poultry, seafood, or, eggs, all, cut, peeled, or, cooked, fruits, and, vegetables, should, be, refrigerated, within, two, hours, after, a, certain, time, harmful, bacteria, may, grow, on, them, and, increase, the, risk, of, foodborne, illness, fruit, allergies, make, up, about, 10, percent, of, all, food, related, allergies, because, fruits, have, been, such, a, major, part, of, the, human, diet, various, cultures, have, developed, many, different, uses, for, fruits, they, do, not, depend, on, for, food, for, example
