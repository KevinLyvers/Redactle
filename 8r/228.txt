menopause, also, known, as, the, climacteric, is, the, time, when, menstrual, periods, permanently, stop, marking, the, end, of, reproduction, it, typically, occurs, between, the, ages, of, 45, and, 55, although, the, exact, timing, can, vary, menopause, is, usually, a, natural, change, it, can, occur, earlier, in, those, who, smoke, tobacco, other, causes, include, surgery, that, removes, both, ovaries, or, some, types, of, chemotherapy, at, the, physiological, level, menopause, happens, because, of, a, decrease, in, the, ovaries, production, of, the, hormones, estrogen, and, progesterone, while, typically, not, needed, a, diagnosis, of, menopause, can, be, confirmed, by, measuring, hormone, levels, in, the, blood, or, urine, menopause, is, the, opposite, of, menarche, the, time, when, a, girl, s, periods, start, in, the, years, before, menopause, a, woman, s, periods, typically, become, irregular, which, means, that, periods, may, be, longer, or, shorter, in, duration, or, be, lighter, or, heavier, in, the, amount, of, flow, during, this, time, women, often, experience, hot, flashes, these, typically, last, from, 30, seconds, to, ten, minutes, and, may, be, associated, with, shivering, night, sweats, and, reddening, of, the, skin, hot, flashes, can, recur, for, four, to, five, years, other, symptoms, may, include, vaginal, dryness, trouble, sleeping, and, mood, changes, the, severity, of, symptoms, varies, between, women, menopause, before, the, age, of, 45, years, is, considered, to, be, early, menopause, and, when, ovarian, failure, surgical, removal, of, the, ovaries, occurs, before, the, age, of, 40, years, this, is, termed, premature, ovarian, insufficiency, in, addition, to, symptoms, hot, flushes, flashes, night, sweats, mood, changes, arthralgia, and, vaginal, dryness, the, physical, consequences, of, menopause, include, bone, loss, increased, central, abdominal, fat, and, adverse, changes, in, a, woman, s, cholesterol, profile, and, vascular, function, these, changes, predispose, postmenopausal, women, to, increased, risks, of, osteoporosis, and, bone, fracture, and, of, cardio, metabolic, disease, diabetes, and, cardiovascular, disease, medical, professionals, often, define, menopause, as, having, occurred, when, a, woman, has, not, had, any, menstrual, bleeding, for, a, year, it, may, also, be, defined, by, a, decrease, in, hormone, production, by, the, ovaries, in, those, who, have, had, surgery, to, remove, their, uterus, but, still, have, functioning, ovaries, menopause, is, not, considered, to, have, yet, occurred, following, the, removal, of, the, uterus, symptoms, of, menopause, typically, occur, earlier, iatrogenic, menopause, occurs, when, both, ovaries, are, surgically, removed, along, with, uterus, for, medical, reasons, the, primary, indications, for, treatment, of, menopause, are, symptoms, and, prevention, of, bone, loss, mild, symptoms, may, be, improved, with, treatment, with, respect, to, hot, flashes, avoiding, smoking, caffeine, and, alcohol, is, often, recommended, sleeping, naked, in, a, cool, room, and, using, a, fan, may, help, the, most, effective, treatment, for, menopausal, symptoms, is, menopausal, hormone, therapy, mht, non, hormonal, therapies, for, hot, flashes, include, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, clinical, hypnosis, gabapentin, fezolinetant, or, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitors, these, will, not, improve, symptoms, such, as, joint, pain, or, vaginal, dryness, which, affect, over, 55, of, women, exercise, may, help, with, sleeping, problems, many, of, the, concerns, about, the, use, of, mht, raised, by, older, studies, are, no, longer, considered, barriers, to, mht, in, healthy, women, high, quality, evidence, for, the, effectiveness, of, alternative, medicine, has, not, been, found, during, early, menopause, transition, the, menstrual, cycles, remain, regular, but, the, interval, between, cycles, begins, to, lengthen, hormone, levels, begin, to, fluctuate, ovulation, may, not, occur, with, each, cycle, the, term, menopause, refers, to, a, point, in, time, that, follows, one, year, after, the, last, menstruation, during, the, menopausal, transition, and, after, menopause, women, can, experience, a, wide, range, of, symptoms, however, for, women, who, enter, the, menopause, transition, without, having, regular, menstrual, cycles, due, to, prior, surgery, other, medical, conditions, or, ongoing, hormonal, contraception, the, menopause, cannot, be, identified, by, bleeding, patterns, and, is, defined, as, the, permanent, loss, of, ovarian, function, during, the, transition, to, menopause, menstrual, patterns, can, show, shorter, cycling, by, 2, 7, days, longer, cycles, remain, possible, there, may, be, irregular, bleeding, lighter, heavier, spotting, dysfunctional, uterine, bleeding, is, often, experienced, by, women, approaching, menopause, due, to, the, hormonal, changes, that, accompany, the, menopause, transition, spotting, or, bleeding, may, simply, be, related, to, vaginal, atrophy, a, benign, sore, polyp, or, lesion, or, may, be, a, functional, endometrial, response, the, european, menopause, and, andropause, society, has, released, guidelines, for, assessment, of, the, endometrium, which, is, usually, the, main, source, of, spotting, or, bleeding, in, post, menopausal, women, however, any, unscheduled, vaginal, bleeding, is, of, concern, and, requires, an, appropriate, investigation, to, rule, out, the, possibility, of, malignant, diseases, urogenital, symptoms, that, may, appear, during, menopause, and, continue, through, postmenopause, include, painful, intercourse, vaginal, dryness, and, atrophic, vaginitis, thinning, of, the, membranes, of, the, vulva, the, vagina, the, cervix, and, the, outer, urinary, tract, along, with, considerable, shrinking, and, loss, in, elasticity, of, all, of, the, outer, and, inner, genital, areas, urinary, urgency, and, burning, up, to, urinary, incontinence, the, most, common, physical, symptoms, of, menopause, are, heavy, night, sweats, and, hot, flashes, also, known, as, vasomotor, symptoms, sleeping, problems, and, insomnia, are, also, common, other, physical, symptoms, may, be, reported, that, are, not, specific, to, menopause, but, may, be, exacerbated, by, it, such, as, lack, of, energy, joint, soreness, stiffness, back, pain, breast, enlargement, breast, pain, heart, palpitations, headache, dizziness, dry, itchy, skin, thinning, tingling, skin, rosacea, weight, gain, psychological, symptoms, are, often, reported, but, they, are, not, specific, to, menopause, and, can, be, caused, by, other, factors, they, include, anxiety, poor, memory, inability, to, concentrate, depressive, mood, irritability, mood, swings, and, less, interest, in, sexual, activity, menopause, related, cognitive, impairment, can, be, confused, with, the, mild, cognitive, impairment, that, precedes, dementia, there, is, evidence, of, small, decreases, in, verbal, memory, on, average, which, may, be, caused, by, the, effects, of, declining, estrogen, levels, on, the, brain, or, perhaps, by, reduced, blood, flow, to, the, brain, during, hot, flashes, however, these, tend, to, resolve, for, most, women, during, the, postmenopause, subjective, reports, of, memory, and, concentration, problems, are, associated, with, several, factors, such, as, lack, of, sleep, and, stress, exposure, to, endogenous, estrogen, during, reproductive, years, provides, women, with, protection, against, cardiovascular, disease, which, is, lost, around, 10, years, after, the, onset, of, menopause, the, menopausal, transition, is, associated, with, an, increase, in, fat, mass, predominantly, in, visceral, fat, an, increase, in, insulin, resistance, dyslipidaemia, and, endothelial, dysfunction, women, with, vasomotor, symptoms, during, menopause, seem, to, have, an, especially, unfavorable, cardiometabolic, profile, as, well, as, women, with, premature, onset, of, menopause, before, 45, years, of, age, these, risks, can, be, reduced, by, managing, risk, factors, such, as, tobacco, smoking, hypertension, increased, blood, lipids, and, body, weight, the, annual, rates, of, bone, mineral, density, loss, are, highest, starting, one, year, before, the, final, menstrual, period, and, continuing, through, the, two, years, after, it, thus, post, menopausal, women, are, at, increased, risk, of, osteopenia, osteoporosis, and, fractures, menopause, can, be, induced, or, occur, naturally, induced, menopause, occurs, as, a, result, of, medical, treatment, such, as, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, oophorectomy, or, complications, of, tubal, ligation, hysterectomy, unilateral, or, bilateral, salpingo, oophorectomy, or, leuprorelin, usage, menopause, typically, occurs, at, some, point, between, 47, and, 54, years, of, age, according, to, various, data, more, than, 95, of, women, have, their, last, period, between, the, ages, of, 44, 56, median, 49, 50, 2, of, women, under, the, age, of, 40, 5, between, the, ages, of, 40, 45, and, the, same, number, between, the, ages, of, 55, 58, have, their, last, bleeding, the, average, age, of, the, last, period, in, the, united, states, is, 51, years, in, russia, is, 50, years, in, greece, is, 49, years, in, turkey, is, 47, years, in, egypt, is, 47, years, and, in, india, is, 46, years, the, menopausal, transition, or, perimenopause, leading, up, to, menopause, usually, lasts, 3, 4, years, sometimes, as, long, as, 5, 14, years, undiagnosed, and, untreated, coeliac, disease, is, a, risk, factor, for, early, menopause, coeliac, disease, can, present, with, several, non, gastrointestinal, symptoms, in, the, absence, of, gastrointestinal, symptoms, and, most, cases, escape, timely, recognition, and, go, undiagnosed, leading, to, a, risk, of, long, term, complications, a, strict, gluten, free, diet, reduces, the, risk, women, with, early, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, coeliac, disease, present, a, normal, duration, of, fertile, life, span, women, who, have, undergone, hysterectomy, with, ovary, conservation, go, through, menopause, on, average, 1, 5, years, earlier, than, the, expected, age, in, rare, cases, a, woman, s, ovaries, stop, working, at, a, very, early, age, ranging, anywhere, from, the, age, of, puberty, to, age, 40, this, is, known, as, premature, ovarian, failure, and, affects, 1, to, 2, of, women, by, age, 40, also, called, premature, ovarian, insufficiency, poi, it, is, diagnosed, or, confirmed, by, high, blood, levels, of, follicle, stimulating, hormone, fsh, and, luteinizing, hormone, lh, on, at, least, three, occasions, at, least, four, weeks, apart, premature, ovarian, insufficiency, may, be, auto, immune, and, therefore, might, co, occur, with, other, autoimmune, disorders, such, as, thyroid, disease, and, diabetes, mellitus, other, causes, include, chemotherapy, being, a, carrier, of, the, fragile, x, syndrome, gene, and, radiotherapy, however, in, about, 50, 80, of, cases, of, premature, ovarian, insufficiency, the, cause, is, unknown, i, e, it, is, generally, idiopathic, an, early, menopause, can, be, related, to, cigarette, smoking, higher, body, mass, index, racial, and, ethnic, factors, illnesses, and, the, removal, of, the, uterus, rates, of, premature, menopause, have, been, found, to, be, significantly, higher, in, fraternal, and, identical, twins, about, 5, of, twins, reach, menopause, before, the, age, of, 40, the, reasons, for, this, are, not, completely, understood, menopause, can, be, surgically, induced, by, bilateral, oophorectomy, removal, of, ovaries, which, is, often, but, not, always, done, in, conjunction, with, removal, of, the, fallopian, tubes, salpingo, oophorectomy, and, uterus, hysterectomy, cessation, of, menses, as, a, result, of, removal, of, the, ovaries, is, called, surgical, menopause, surgical, treatments, such, as, the, removal, of, ovaries, might, cause, periods, to, stop, altogether, the, sudden, and, complete, drop, in, hormone, levels, may, produce, extreme, withdrawal, symptoms, such, as, hot, flashes, etc, the, symptoms, of, early, menopause, may, be, more, severe, removal, of, the, uterus, without, removal, of, the, ovaries, does, not, directly, cause, menopause, although, pelvic, surgery, of, this, type, can, often, precipitate, a, somewhat, earlier, menopause, perhaps, because, of, a, compromised, blood, supply, to, the, ovaries, the, time, between, surgery, and, possible, early, menopause, is, due, to, the, fact, that, ovaries, are, still, producing, hormones, the, menopausal, transition, and, postmenopause, itself, is, a, natural, change, not, usually, a, disease, state, or, a, disorder, the, main, cause, of, this, transition, is, the, natural, depletion, and, aging, of, the, finite, amount, of, oocytes, ovarian, reserve, this, process, is, sometimes, accelerated, by, other, conditions, and, is, known, to, occur, earlier, after, a, wide, range, of, gynecologic, procedures, such, as, hysterectomy, with, and, without, ovariectomy, endometrial, ablation, and, uterine, artery, embolisation, the, depletion, of, the, ovarian, reserve, causes, an, increase, in, circulating, follicle, stimulating, hormone, fsh, and, luteinizing, hormone, lh, levels, because, there, are, fewer, oocytes, and, follicles, responding, to, these, hormones, and, producing, estrogen, the, transition, has, a, variable, degree, of, effects, the, stages, of, the, menopause, transition, have, been, classified, according, to, a, woman, s, reported, bleeding, pattern, supported, by, changes, in, the, pituitary, follicle, stimulating, hormone, fsh, levels, in, younger, women, during, a, normal, menstrual, cycle, the, ovaries, produce, estradiol, testosterone, and, progesterone, in, a, cyclical, pattern, under, the, control, of, fsh, and, luteinizing, hormone, lh, which, are, both, produced, by, the, pituitary, gland, during, perimenopause, approaching, menopause, estradiol, levels, and, patterns, of, production, remain, relatively, unchanged, or, may, increase, compared, to, young, women, but, the, cycles, become, frequently, shorter, or, irregular, the, often, observed, increase, in, estrogen, is, presumed, to, be, in, response, to, elevated, fsh, levels, that, in, turn, is, hypothesized, to, be, caused, by, decreased, feedback, by, inhibin, similarly, decreased, inhibin, feedback, after, hysterectomy, is, hypothesized, to, contribute, to, increased, ovarian, stimulation, and, earlier, menopause, the, menopausal, transition, is, characterized, by, marked, and, often, dramatic, variations, in, fsh, and, estradiol, levels, because, of, this, measurements, of, these, hormones, are, not, considered, to, be, reliable, guides, to, a, woman, s, exact, menopausal, status, menopause, occurs, because, of, the, sharp, decrease, of, estradiol, and, progesterone, production, by, the, ovaries, after, menopause, estrogen, continues, to, be, produced, mostly, by, aromatase, in, fat, tissues, and, is, produced, in, small, amounts, in, many, other, tissues, such, as, ovaries, bone, blood, vessels, and, the, brain, where, it, acts, locally, the, substantial, fall, in, circulating, estradiol, levels, at, menopause, impacts, many, tissues, from, brain, to, skin, in, contrast, to, the, sudden, fall, in, estradiol, during, menopause, the, levels, of, total, and, free, testosterone, as, well, as, dehydroepiandrosterone, sulfate, dheas, and, androstenedione, appear, to, decline, more, or, less, steadily, with, age, an, effect, of, natural, menopause, on, circulating, androgen, levels, has, not, been, observed, thus, specific, tissue, effects, of, natural, menopause, cannot, be, attributed, to, loss, of, androgenic, hormone, production, hot, flashes, and, other, vasomotor, and, body, symptoms, accompanying, the, menopausal, transition, are, associated, with, estrogen, insufficiency, and, changes, that, occur, in, the, brain, primarily, the, hypothalamus, and, involve, complex, interplay, between, the, neurotransmitters, kisspeptin, neurokinin, b, and, dynorphin, which, are, found, in, kndy, neurons, in, the, infundibular, nucleus, decreased, inhibin, feedback, after, hysterectomy, is, hypothesized, to, contribute, to, increased, ovarian, stimulation, and, earlier, menopause, hastened, ovarian, aging, has, been, observed, after, endometrial, ablation, while, it, is, difficult, to, prove, that, these, surgeries, are, causative, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, the, endometrium, may, be, producing, endocrine, factors, contributing, to, the, endocrine, feedback, and, regulation, of, the, ovarian, stimulation, elimination, of, these, factors, contributes, to, faster, depletion, of, the, ovarian, reserve, reduced, blood, supply, to, the, ovaries, that, may, occur, as, a, consequence, of, hysterectomy, and, uterine, artery, embolisation, has, been, hypothesized, to, contribute, to, this, effect, impaired, dna, repair, mechanisms, may, contribute, to, earlier, depletion, of, the, ovarian, reserve, during, aging, as, women, age, double, strand, breaks, accumulate, in, the, dna, of, their, primordial, follicles, primordial, follicles, are, immature, primary, oocytes, surrounded, by, a, single, layer, of, granulosa, cells, an, enzyme, system, is, present, in, oocytes, that, ordinarily, accurately, repairs, dna, double, strand, breaks, this, repair, system, is, called, homologous, recombinational, repair, and, it, is, especially, effective, during, meiosis, meiosis, is, the, general, process, by, which, germ, cells, are, formed, in, all, sexual, eukaryotes, it, appears, to, be, an, adaptation, for, efficiently, removing, damages, in, germ, line, dna, human, primary, oocytes, are, present, at, an, intermediate, stage, of, meiosis, termed, prophase, i, see, oogenesis, expression, of, four, key, dna, repair, genes, that, are, necessary, for, homologous, recombinational, repair, during, meiosis, brca1, mre11, rad51, and, atm, decline, with, age, in, oocytes, this, age, related, decline, in, ability, to, repair, dna, double, strand, damages, can, account, for, the, accumulation, of, these, damages, that, then, likely, contributes, to, the, depletion, of, the, ovarian, reserve, ways, of, assessing, the, impact, on, women, of, some, of, these, menopause, effects, include, the, greene, climacteric, scale, questionnaire, the, cervantes, scale, and, the, menopause, rating, scale, the, term, perimenopause, which, literally, means, around, the, menopause, refers, to, the, menopause, transition, years, before, the, date, of, the, final, episode, of, flow, according, to, the, north, american, menopause, society, this, transition, can, last, for, four, to, eight, years, the, centre, for, menstrual, cycle, and, ovulation, research, describes, it, as, a, six, to, ten, year, phase, ending, 12, months, after, the, last, menstrual, period, during, perimenopause, estrogen, levels, average, about, 20, 30, higher, than, during, premenopause, often, with, wide, fluctuations, these, fluctuations, cause, many, of, the, physical, changes, during, perimenopause, as, well, as, menopause, especially, during, the, last, 1, 2, years, of, perimenopause, before, menopause, some, of, these, changes, are, hot, flashes, night, sweats, difficulty, sleeping, mood, swings, vaginal, dryness, or, atrophy, incontinence, osteoporosis, and, heart, disease, perimenopause, is, also, associated, with, a, higher, likelihood, of, depression, affecting, from, 45, percent, to, 68, percent, of, perimenopausal, women, which, is, twice, as, likely, to, affect, those, with, a, history, of, depression, during, this, period, fertility, diminishes, but, is, not, considered, to, reach, zero, until, the, official, date, of, menopause, the, official, date, is, determined, retroactively, once, 12, months, have, passed, after, the, last, appearance, of, menstrual, blood, the, menopause, transition, typically, begins, between, 40, and, 50, years, of, age, average, 47, 5, the, duration, of, perimenopause, may, be, for, up, to, eight, years, women, will, often, but, not, always, start, these, transitions, perimenopause, and, menopause, about, the, same, time, as, their, mother, did, some, research, appears, to, show, that, melatonin, supplementation, in, perimenopausal, women, can, improve, thyroid, function, and, gonadotropin, levels, as, well, as, restoring, fertility, and, menstruation, and, preventing, depression, associated, with, menopause, the, term, postmenopausal, describes, women, who, have, not, experienced, any, menstrual, flow, for, a, minimum, of, 12, months, assuming, that, they, have, a, uterus, and, are, not, pregnant, or, lactating, the, reason, for, this, delay, in, declaring, postmenopause, is, that, periods, are, usually, erratic, during, menopause, therefore, a, reasonably, long, stretch, of, time, is, necessary, to, be, sure, that, the, cycling, has, ceased, at, this, point, a, woman, is, considered, infertile, however, the, possibility, of, becoming, pregnant, has, usually, been, very, low, but, not, quite, zero, for, a, number, of, years, before, this, point, is, reached, in, women, with, or, without, a, uterus, menopause, or, postmenopause, can, also, be, identified, by, a, blood, test, showing, a, very, high, follicle, stimulating, hormone, level, greater, than, 25, iu, l, in, a, random, blood, draw, it, rises, as, ovaries, become, inactive, fsh, continues, to, rise, as, its, counterpart, estradiol, continues, to, drop, for, about, 2, years, after, the, last, menstrual, period, after, which, the, levels, of, each, of, these, hormones, stabilize, the, stabilization, period, after, the, begin, of, early, postmenopause, has, been, estimated, to, last, 3, to, 6, years, so, early, postmenopause, lasts, altogether, about, 5, to, 8, years, during, which, hormone, withdrawal, effects, such, as, hot, flashes, disappear, finally, late, postmenopause, has, been, defined, as, the, remainder, of, a, woman, s, lifespan, when, reproductive, hormones, do, not, change, any, more, a, period, like, flow, during, postmenopause, even, spotting, may, be, a, sign, of, endometrial, cancer, perimenopause, is, a, natural, stage, of, life, it, is, not, a, disease, or, a, disorder, therefore, it, does, not, automatically, require, any, kind, of, medical, treatment, however, in, those, cases, where, the, physical, mental, and, emotional, effects, of, perimenopause, are, strong, enough, that, they, significantly, disrupt, the, life, of, the, woman, experiencing, them, palliative, medical, therapy, may, sometimes, be, appropriate, in, the, context, of, the, menopause, menopausal, hormone, therapy, mht, is, the, use, of, estrogen, in, women, without, a, uterus, and, estrogen, plus, progestogen, in, women, who, have, an, intact, uterus, mht, may, be, reasonable, for, the, treatment, of, menopausal, symptoms, such, as, hot, flashes, it, is, the, most, effective, treatment, option, especially, when, delivered, as, a, skin, patch, its, use, however, appears, to, increase, the, risk, of, strokes, and, blood, clots, when, used, for, menopausal, symptoms, the, global, recommendation, is, mht, should, be, prescribed, for, a, long, as, there, are, defined, treatment, effects, and, goals, for, the, individual, woman, mht, is, also, effective, for, preventing, bone, loss, and, osteoporotic, fracture, but, it, is, generally, recommended, only, for, women, at, significant, risk, for, whom, other, therapies, are, unsuitable, mht, may, be, unsuitable, for, some, women, including, those, at, increased, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, increased, risk, of, thromboembolic, disease, such, as, those, with, obesity, or, a, history, of, venous, thrombosis, or, increased, risk, of, some, types, of, cancer, there, is, some, concern, that, this, treatment, increases, the, risk, of, breast, cancer, women, at, increased, risk, of, cardiometabolic, disease, and, vte, may, be, able, to, use, transdermal, estradiol, which, does, not, appear, to, increase, risks, in, low, to, moderate, doses, adding, testosterone, to, hormone, therapy, has, a, positive, effect, on, sexual, function, in, postmenopausal, women, although, it, may, be, accompanied, by, hair, growth, or, acne, if, used, in, excess, transdermal, testosterone, therapy, in, appropriate, dosing, is, generally, safe, serms, are, a, category, of, drugs, either, synthetically, produced, or, derived, from, a, botanical, source, that, act, selectively, as, agonists, or, antagonists, on, the, estrogen, receptors, throughout, the, body, the, most, commonly, prescribed, serms, are, raloxifene, and, tamoxifen, raloxifene, exhibits, oestrogen, agonist, activity, on, bone, and, lipids, and, antagonist, activity, on, breast, and, the, endometrium, tamoxifen, is, in, widespread, use, for, treatment, of, hormone, sensitive, breast, cancer, raloxifene, prevents, vertebral, fractures, in, postmenopausal, osteoporotic, women, and, reduces, the, risk, of, invasive, breast, cancer, some, of, the, ssris, and, snris, appear, to, provide, some, relief, from, vasomotor, symptoms, the, most, effective, ssris, and, snris, are, paroxetine, escitalopram, citalopram, venlafaxine, and, desvenlafaxine, they, may, however, be, associated, with, appetite, and, sleeping, problems, constipation, and, nausea, gabapentin, or, fezolinetant, can, also, improve, the, frequency, and, severity, of, vasomotor, symptoms, side, effects, of, using, gabapentin, include, drowsiness, and, headaches, cognitive, behavioural, therapy, and, clinical, hypnosis, can, decrease, the, amount, women, are, affected, by, hot, flashes, mindfulness, is, not, yet, proven, to, be, effective, in, easing, vasomotor, symptoms, exercise, has, been, thought, to, reduce, postmenopausal, symptoms, through, the, increase, of, endorphin, levels, which, decrease, as, estrogen, production, decreases, however, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, suggest, that, exercise, helps, with, the, symptoms, of, menopause, similarly, yoga, has, not, been, shown, to, be, useful, as, a, treatment, for, vasomotor, symptoms, however, a, high, bmi, is, a, risk, factor, for, vasomotor, symptoms, in, particular, weight, loss, may, help, with, symptom, management, there, is, no, strong, evidence, that, cooling, techniques, such, as, using, specific, clothing, or, environment, control, tools, for, example, fans, help, with, symptoms, paced, breathing, and, relaxation, are, not, effective, in, easing, symptoms, there, is, no, evidence, of, consistent, benefit, of, taking, any, dietary, supplements, or, herbal, products, for, menopausal, symptoms, these, widely, marketed, but, ineffective, supplements, include, soy, isoflavones, pollen, extracts, black, cohosh, omega, 3, among, many, others, there, is, no, evidence, of, consistent, benefit, of, alternative, therapies, for, menopausal, symptoms, despite, their, popularity, as, of, 2023, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, the, efficacy, of, acupuncture, as, a, management, for, menopausal, symptoms, the, cochrane, review, found, not, enough, evidence, in, 2016, to, show, a, difference, between, chinese, herbal, medicine, and, placebo, for, the, vasomotor, symptoms, the, menopause, transition, is, a, process, involving, hormonal, menstrual, and, typically, vasomotor, changes, however, the, experience, of, the, menopause, as, a, whole, is, very, much, influenced, by, psychological, and, social, factors, such, as, past, experience, lifestyle, social, and, cultural, meanings, of, menopause, and, a, woman, s, social, and, material, circumstances, menopause, has, been, described, as, a, biopsychosocial, experience, with, social, and, cultural, factors, playing, a, prominent, role, in, the, way, menopause, is, experienced, and, perceived, the, paradigm, within, which, a, woman, considers, menopause, influences, the, way, she, views, it, women, who, understand, menopause, as, a, medical, condition, rate, it, significantly, more, negatively, than, those, who, view, it, as, a, life, transition, or, a, symbol, of, aging, there, is, some, evidence, that, negative, attitudes, and, expectations, held, before, the, menopause, predict, symptom, experience, during, the, menopause, and, interestingly, beliefs, and, attitudes, toward, menopause, tend, to, be, more, positive, in, postmenopausal, than, in, premenopausal, women, women, with, more, negative, attitudes, towards, the, menopause, report, more, symptoms, during, this, transition, menopause, is, a, stage, of, life, experienced, in, different, ways, it, can, be, characterized, by, personal, challenges, changes, in, personal, roles, within, the, family, and, society, women, s, approaches, to, changes, during, menopause, are, influenced, by, their, personal, family, and, sociocultural, background, women, from, different, regions, and, countries, also, have, different, attitudes, postmenopausal, women, had, more, positive, attitudes, toward, menopause, compared, with, peri, or, premenopausal, women, other, influencing, factors, of, attitudes, toward, menopause, include, age, menopausal, symptoms, psychological, and, socioeconomical, status, and, profession, and, ethnicity, ethnicity, and, geography, play, roles, in, the, experience, of, menopause, american, women, of, different, ethnicities, report, significantly, different, types, of, menopausal, effects, one, major, study, found, caucasian, women, most, likely, to, report, what, are, sometimes, described, as, psychosomatic, symptoms, while, african, american, women, were, more, likely, to, report, vasomotor, symptoms, there, may, be, variations, in, experiences, of, women, from, different, ethnic, backgrounds, regarding, menopause, and, care, immigrant, women, reported, more, vasomotor, symptoms, and, other, physical, symptoms, and, poorer, mental, health, than, non, immigrant, women, and, were, mostly, dissatisfied, with, the, care, they, had, received, self, management, strategies, for, menopausal, symptoms, were, also, influenced, by, culture, two, multinational, studies, of, asian, women, found, that, hot, flushes, were, not, the, most, commonly, reported, symptoms, instead, body, and, joint, aches, memory, problems, sleeplessness, irritability, and, migraines, were, in, another, study, comparing, experiences, of, menopause, amongst, white, australian, women, and, women, in, laos, australian, women, reported, higher, rates, of, depression, as, well, as, fears, of, aging, weight, gain, and, cancer, fears, not, reported, by, laotian, women, who, positioned, menopause, as, a, positive, event, japanese, women, experience, menopause, effects, or, konenki, in, a, different, way, from, american, women, japanese, women, report, lower, rates, of, hot, flashes, and, night, sweats, this, can, be, attributed, to, a, variety, of, factors, both, biological, and, social, historically, konenki, was, associated, with, wealthy, middle, class, housewives, in, japan, i, e, it, was, a, luxury, disease, that, women, from, traditional, inter, generational, rural, households, did, not, report, menopause, in, japan, was, viewed, as, a, symptom, of, the, inevitable, process, of, aging, rather, than, a, revolutionary, transition, or, a, deficiency, disease, in, need, of, management, as, of, 2005, in, japanese, culture, reporting, of, vasomotor, symptoms, has, been, on, the, increase, with, research, finding, that, of, 140, japanese, participants, hot, flashes, were, prevalent, in, 22, 1, this, was, almost, double, that, of, 20, years, prior, whilst, the, exact, cause, for, this, is, unknown, possible, contributing, factors, include, dietary, changes, increased, medicalisation, of, middle, aged, women, and, increased, media, attention, on, the, subject, however, reporting, of, vasomotor, symptoms, is, still, significantly, lower, than, in, north, america, additionally, while, most, women, in, the, united, states, apparently, have, a, negative, view, of, menopause, as, a, time, of, deterioration, or, decline, some, studies, seem, to, indicate, that, women, from, some, asian, cultures, have, an, understanding, of, menopause, that, focuses, on, a, sense, of, liberation, and, celebrates, the, freedom, from, the, risk, of, pregnancy, diverging, from, these, conclusions, one, study, appeared, to, show, that, many, american, women, experience, this, time, as, one, of, liberation, and, self, actualization, in, some, women, menopause, may, bring, about, a, sense, of, loss, related, to, the, end, of, fertility, in, addition, this, change, often, aligns, with, other, stressors, such, as, the, responsibility, of, looking, after, elderly, parents, or, dealing, with, the, emotional, challenges, of, empty, nest, syndrome, when, children, move, out, of, the, family, home, this, situation, can, be, accentuated, in, cultures, where, being, older, is, negatively, perceived, midlife, is, typically, a, life, stage, when, men, and, women, may, be, dealing, with, demanding, life, events, and, responsibilities, such, as, work, health, problems, and, caring, roles, for, example, in, 2018, in, the, uk, women, aged, 45, 54, report, more, work, related, stress, than, men, or, women, of, any, other, age, group, hot, flashes, are, often, reported, to, be, particularly, distressing, at, work, and, lead, to, embarrassment, and, worry, about, potential, stigmatisation, a, june, 2023, study, by, the, mayo, clinic, estimated, an, annual, loss, of, 1, 8, billion, in, the, united, states, due, to, workdays, missed, as, a, result, of, menopause, symptoms, this, was, one, of, the, largest, studies, to, date, examining, the, impact, of, menopause, symptoms, on, work, outcomes, the, research, concluded, there, was, a, strong, need, to, improve, medical, treatment, for, menopausal, women, and, make, the, workplace, environment, more, supportive, to, avoid, such, productivity, losses, menopause, literally, means, the, end, of, monthly, cycles, the, end, of, monthly, periods, or, menstruation, from, the, greek, word, pausis, pause, and, m, n, month, this, is, a, medical, coinage, the, greek, word, for, menses, is, actually, different, in, ancient, greek, the, menses, were, described, in, the, plural, ta, emm, nia, the, monthlies, and, its, modern, descendant, has, been, clipped, to, ta, emm, na, the, modern, greek, medical, term, is, emmenopausis, in, katharevousa, or, emmenopausi, in, demotic, greek, the, ancient, greeks, did, not, produce, medical, concepts, about, any, symptoms, associated, with, end, of, menstruation, and, did, not, use, a, specific, word, to, refer, to, this, time, of, a, woman, s, life, the, word, menopause, was, invented, by, french, doctors, at, the, beginning, of, the, nineteenth, century, greek, etymology, was, reconstructed, at, this, time, and, it, was, the, parisian, student, doctor, charles, pierre, louis, de, gardanne, who, invented, a, variation, of, the, word, in, 1812, which, was, edited, to, its, final, french, form, in, 1821, some, of, them, noted, that, peasant, women, had, no, complaints, about, the, end, of, menses, while, urban, middle, class, women, had, many, troubling, symptoms, doctors, at, this, time, considered, the, symptoms, to, be, the, result, of, urban, lifestyles, of, sedentary, behaviour, alcohol, consumption, too, much, time, indoors, and, over, eating, with, a, lack, of, fresh, fruit, and, vegetables, the, word, menopause, was, coined, specifically, for, female, humans, where, the, end, of, fertility, is, traditionally, indicated, by, the, permanent, stopping, of, monthly, menstruations, however, menopause, exists, in, some, other, animals, many, of, which, do, not, have, monthly, menstruation, in, this, case, the, term, means, a, natural, end, to, fertility, that, occurs, before, the, end, of, the, natural, lifespan, in, the, 21st, century, celebrities, have, spoken, out, about, their, experiences, of, the, menopause, which, has, led, to, it, becoming, less, of, a, taboo, as, it, has, boosted, awareness, of, the, debilitating, symptoms, subsequently, tv, shows, have, been, running, features, on, the, menopause, to, help, women, experiencing, symptoms, in, the, uk, lorraine, kelly, has, been, an, advocate, for, getting, women, to, speak, about, their, experiences, including, sharing, her, own, this, has, led, to, an, increase, in, women, seeking, treatment, such, as, hrt, davina, mccall, also, led, an, awareness, campaign, based, on, a, documentary, on, channel, 4, in, the, uk, carolyn, harris, sponsored, the, menopause, support, and, services, bill, in, june, 2021, it, was, to, exempt, hormone, replacement, therapy, from, national, health, service, prescription, charges, and, to, make, provisions, about, menopause, support, and, services, including, public, education, and, communication, in, supporting, perimenopausal, and, post, menopausal, women, and, to, raise, awareness, of, menopause, and, its, effects, the, bill, was, withdrawn, on, 29, october, 2021, in, the, us, david, mckinley, republican, from, west, virginia, introduced, the, menopause, research, act, in, september, 2022, for, 100, million, in, 2023, and, 2024, but, it, stalled, few, animals, have, a, menopause, humans, are, joined, by, just, five, other, species, in, which, females, live, substantially, longer, than, their, ability, to, reproduce, the, others, are, all, cetaceans, beluga, whales, narwhals, orcas, false, killer, whales, and, short, finned, pilot, whales, menopause, has, been, reported, in, a, variety, of, other, vertebrate, species, but, these, examples, tend, to, be, from, captive, individuals, and, thus, are, not, necessarily, representative, of, what, happens, in, natural, populations, in, the, wild, menopause, in, captivity, has, been, observed, in, several, species, of, nonhuman, primates, including, rhesus, monkeys, and, chimpanzees, some, research, suggests, that, wild, chimpanzees, do, not, experience, menopause, as, their, fertility, declines, are, associated, with, declines, in, overall, health, menopause, has, been, reported, in, elephants, in, captivity, and, guppies, dogs, do, not, experience, menopause, the, canine, estrus, cycle, simply, becomes, irregular, and, infrequent, although, older, female, dogs, are, not, considered, good, candidates, for, breeding, offspring, have, been, produced, by, older, animals, see, canine, reproduction, similar, observations, have, been, made, in, cats, life, histories, show, a, varying, degree, of, senescence, rapid, senescing, organisms, e, g, pacific, salmon, and, annual, plants, do, not, have, a, post, reproductive, life, stage, gradual, senescence, is, exhibited, by, all, placental, mammalian, life, histories, there, are, various, theories, on, the, origin, and, process, of, the, evolution, of, the, menopause, these, attempt, to, suggest, evolutionary, benefits, to, the, human, species, stemming, from, the, cessation, of, women, s, reproductive, capability, before, the, end, of, their, natural, lifespan, it, is, conjectured, that, in, highly, social, groups, natural, selection, favors, females, that, stop, reproducing, and, devote, that, post, reproductive, life, span, to, continuing, to, care, for, existing, offspring, both, their, own, and, those, of, others, to, whom, they, are, related, especially, their, granddaughters, and, grandsons
