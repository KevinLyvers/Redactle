a, camel, from, latin, camelus, and, greek, kam, los, from, ancient, semitic, g, m, l, is, an, even, toed, ungulate, in, the, genus, camelus, that, bears, distinctive, fatty, deposits, known, as, humps, on, its, back, camels, have, long, been, domesticated, and, as, livestock, they, provide, food, camel, milk, and, meat, and, textiles, fiber, and, felt, from, camel, hair, camels, are, working, animals, especially, suited, to, their, desert, habitat, and, are, a, vital, means, of, transport, for, passengers, and, cargo, there, are, three, surviving, species, of, camel, the, one, humped, dromedary, makes, up, 94, of, the, world, s, camel, population, and, the, two, humped, bactrian, camel, makes, up, 6, the, wild, bactrian, camel, is, a, distinct, species, that, is, not, ancestral, to, the, domestic, bactrian, camel, and, is, now, critically, endangered, with, fewer, than, 1, 000, individuals, the, word, camel, is, also, used, informally, in, a, wider, sense, where, the, more, correct, term, is, camelid, to, include, all, seven, species, of, the, family, camelidae, the, true, camels, the, above, three, species, along, with, the, new, world, camelids, the, llama, the, alpaca, the, guanaco, and, the, vicu, a, which, belong, to, the, separate, tribe, lamini, camelids, originated, in, north, america, during, the, eocene, with, the, ancestor, of, modern, camels, paracamelus, migrating, across, the, bering, land, bridge, into, asia, during, the, late, miocene, around, 6, million, years, ago, three, species, are, extant, the, average, life, expectancy, of, a, camel, is, 40, to, 50, years, a, full, grown, adult, dromedary, camel, stands, 1, 85, m, 6, ft, 1, in, at, the, shoulder, and, 2, 15, m, 7, ft, 1, in, at, the, hump, bactrian, camels, can, be, a, foot, taller, camels, can, run, at, up, to, 65, km, h, 40, mph, in, short, bursts, and, sustain, speeds, of, up, to, 40, km, h, 25, mph, bactrian, camels, weigh, 300, to, 1, 000, kg, 660, to, 2, 200, lb, and, dromedaries, 300, to, 600, kg, 660, to, 1, 320, lb, the, widening, toes, on, a, camel, s, hoof, provide, supplemental, grip, for, varying, soil, sediments, the, male, dromedary, camel, has, an, organ, called, a, dulla, in, his, throat, a, large, inflatable, sac, that, he, extrudes, from, his, mouth, when, in, rut, to, assert, dominance, and, attract, females, it, resembles, a, long, swollen, pink, tongue, hanging, out, of, the, side, of, the, camel, s, mouth, camels, mate, by, having, both, male, and, female, sitting, on, the, ground, with, the, male, mounting, from, behind, the, male, usually, ejaculates, three, or, four, times, within, a, single, mating, session, camelids, are, the, only, ungulates, to, mate, in, a, sitting, position, camels, do, not, directly, store, water, in, their, humps, they, are, reservoirs, of, fatty, tissue, when, this, tissue, is, metabolized, it, yields, a, greater, mass, of, water, than, that, of, the, fat, processed, this, fat, metabolization, while, releasing, energy, causes, water, to, evaporate, from, the, lungs, during, respiration, as, oxygen, is, required, for, the, metabolic, process, overall, there, is, a, net, decrease, in, water, camels, have, a, series, of, physiological, adaptations, that, allow, them, to, withstand, long, periods, of, time, without, any, external, source, of, water, the, dromedary, camel, can, drink, as, seldom, as, once, every, 10, days, even, under, very, hot, conditions, and, can, lose, up, to, 30, of, its, body, mass, due, to, dehydration, unlike, other, mammals, camels, red, blood, cells, are, oval, rather, than, circular, in, shape, this, facilitates, the, flow, of, red, blood, cells, during, dehydration, and, makes, them, better, at, withstanding, high, osmotic, variation, without, rupturing, when, drinking, large, amounts, of, water, a, 600, kg, 1, 300, lb, camel, can, drink, 200, l, 53, us, gal, of, water, in, three, minutes, camels, are, able, to, withstand, changes, in, body, temperature, and, water, consumption, that, would, kill, most, other, mammals, their, temperature, ranges, from, 34, c, 93, f, at, dawn, and, steadily, increases, to, 40, c, 104, f, by, sunset, before, they, cool, off, at, night, again, in, general, to, compare, between, camels, and, the, other, livestock, camels, lose, only, 1, 3, liters, of, fluid, intake, every, day, while, the, other, livestock, lose, 20, to, 40, liters, per, day, maintaining, the, brain, temperature, within, certain, limits, is, critical, for, animals, to, assist, this, camels, have, a, rete, mirabile, a, complex, of, arteries, and, veins, lying, very, close, to, each, other, which, utilizes, countercurrent, blood, flow, to, cool, blood, flowing, to, the, brain, camels, rarely, sweat, even, when, ambient, temperatures, reach, 49, c, 120, f, any, sweat, that, does, occur, evaporates, at, the, skin, level, rather, than, at, the, surface, of, their, coat, the, heat, of, vaporization, therefore, comes, from, body, heat, rather, than, ambient, heat, camels, can, withstand, losing, 25, of, their, body, weight, in, water, whereas, most, other, mammals, can, withstand, only, about, 12, 14, dehydration, before, cardiac, failure, results, from, circulatory, disturbance, when, the, camel, exhales, water, vapor, becomes, trapped, in, their, nostrils, and, is, reabsorbed, into, the, body, as, a, means, to, conserve, water, camels, eating, green, herbage, can, ingest, sufficient, moisture, in, milder, conditions, to, maintain, their, bodies, hydrated, state, without, the, need, for, drinking, the, camel, s, thick, coat, insulates, it, from, the, intense, heat, radiated, from, desert, sand, a, shorn, camel, must, sweat, 50, more, to, avoid, overheating, during, the, summer, the, coat, becomes, lighter, in, color, reflecting, light, as, well, as, helping, avoid, sunburn, the, camel, s, long, legs, help, by, keeping, its, body, farther, from, the, ground, which, can, heat, up, to, 70, c, 158, f, dromedaries, have, a, pad, of, thick, tissue, over, the, sternum, called, the, pedestal, when, the, animal, lies, down, in, a, sternal, recumbent, position, the, pedestal, raises, the, body, from, the, hot, surface, and, allows, cooling, air, to, pass, under, the, body, camels, mouths, have, a, thick, leathery, lining, allowing, them, to, chew, thorny, desert, plants, long, eyelashes, and, ear, hairs, together, with, nostrils, that, can, close, form, a, barrier, against, sand, if, sand, gets, lodged, in, their, eyes, they, can, dislodge, it, using, their, translucent, third, eyelid, also, known, as, the, nictitating, membrane, the, camels, gait, and, widened, feet, help, them, move, without, sinking, into, the, sand, the, kidneys, and, intestines, of, a, camel, are, very, efficient, at, reabsorbing, water, camels, kidneys, have, a, 1, 4, cortex, to, medulla, ratio, thus, the, medullary, part, of, a, camel, s, kidney, occupies, twice, as, much, area, as, a, cow, s, kidney, secondly, renal, corpuscles, have, a, smaller, diameter, which, reduces, surface, area, for, filtration, these, two, major, anatomical, characteristics, enable, camels, to, conserve, water, and, limit, the, volume, of, urine, in, extreme, desert, conditions, camel, urine, comes, out, as, a, thick, syrup, and, camel, faeces, are, so, dry, that, they, do, not, require, drying, when, used, to, fuel, fires, the, camel, immune, system, differs, from, those, of, other, mammals, normally, the, y, shaped, antibody, molecules, consist, of, two, heavy, or, long, chains, along, the, length, of, the, y, and, two, light, or, short, chains, at, each, tip, of, the, y, camels, in, addition, to, these, also, have, antibodies, made, of, only, two, heavy, chains, a, trait, that, makes, them, smaller, and, more, durable, these, heavy, chain, only, antibodies, discovered, in, 1993, are, thought, to, have, developed, 50, million, years, ago, after, camelids, split, from, ruminants, and, pigs, camels, suffer, from, surra, caused, by, trypanosoma, evansi, wherever, camels, are, domesticated, in, the, world, 2, and, resultantly, camels, have, evolved, trypanolytic, antibodies, as, with, many, mammals, in, the, future, nanobody, single, domain, antibody, therapy, will, surpass, natural, camel, antibodies, by, reaching, locations, currently, unreachable, due, to, natural, antibodies, larger, size, 788, such, therapies, may, also, be, suitable, for, other, mammals, 788, tran, et, al, 2009, provides, a, new, reference, test, for, surra, t, evansi, of, camel, they, use, recombinant, invariant, surface, glycoprotein, 75, risg75, an, invariant, surface, glycoprotein, and, elisa, the, tran, test, has, high, test, specificity, and, appears, likely, to, work, just, as, well, for, t, evansi, in, other, hosts, and, for, a, pan, trypanozoon, test, which, would, also, be, useful, for, t, b, brucei, t, b, gambiense, t, b, rhodesiense, and, t, equiperdum, the, karyotypes, of, different, camelid, species, have, been, studied, earlier, by, many, groups, but, no, agreement, on, chromosome, nomenclature, of, camelids, has, been, reached, a, 2007, study, flow, sorted, camel, chromosomes, building, on, the, fact, that, camels, have, 37, pairs, of, chromosomes, 2n, 74, and, found, that, the, karyotype, consisted, of, one, metacentric, three, submetacentric, and, 32, acrocentric, autosomes, the, y, is, a, small, metacentric, chromosome, while, the, x, is, a, large, metacentric, chromosome, the, hybrid, camel, a, hybrid, between, bactrian, and, dromedary, camels, has, one, hump, though, it, has, an, indentation, 4, 12, cm, 1, 6, 4, 7, in, deep, that, divides, the, front, from, the, back, the, hybrid, is, 2, 15, m, 7, ft, 1, in, at, the, shoulder, and, 2, 32, m, 7, ft, 7, in, tall, at, the, hump, it, weighs, an, average, of, 650, kg, 1, 430, lb, and, can, carry, around, 400, to, 450, kg, 880, to, 990, lb, which, is, more, than, either, the, dromedary, or, bactrian, can, according, to, molecular, data, the, wild, bactrian, camel, c, ferus, separated, from, the, domestic, bactrian, camel, c, bactrianus, about, 1, million, years, ago, new, world, and, old, world, camelids, diverged, about, 11, million, years, ago, in, spite, of, this, these, species, can, hybridize, and, produce, viable, offspring, the, cama, is, a, camel, llama, hybrid, bred, by, scientists, to, see, how, closely, related, the, parent, species, are, scientists, collected, semen, from, a, camel, via, an, artificial, vagina, and, inseminated, a, llama, after, stimulating, ovulation, with, gonadotrophin, injections, the, cama, is, halfway, in, size, between, a, camel, and, a, llama, and, lacks, a, hump, it, has, ears, intermediate, between, those, of, camels, and, llamas, longer, legs, than, the, llama, and, partially, cloven, hooves, like, the, mule, camas, are, sterile, despite, both, parents, having, the, same, number, of, chromosomes, the, earliest, known, camel, called, protylopus, lived, in, north, america, 40, to, 50, million, years, ago, during, the, eocene, it, was, about, the, size, of, a, rabbit, and, lived, in, the, open, woodlands, of, what, is, now, south, dakota, by, 35, million, years, ago, the, poebrotherium, was, the, size, of, a, goat, and, had, many, more, traits, similar, to, camels, and, llamas, the, hoofed, stenomylus, which, walked, on, the, tips, of, its, toes, also, existed, around, this, time, and, the, long, necked, aepycamelus, evolved, in, the, miocene, the, split, between, the, tribes, camelini, which, contains, modern, camels, and, lamini, modern, llamas, alpacas, vicu, as, and, guanacos, is, estimated, to, have, occurred, over, 16, million, years, ago, the, ancestor, of, modern, camels, paracamelus, migrated, into, eurasia, from, north, america, via, beringia, during, the, late, miocene, between, 7, 5, and, 6, 5, million, years, ago, during, the, pleistocene, around, 3, to, 1, million, years, ago, the, north, american, camelidae, spread, to, south, america, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, via, the, newly, formed, isthmus, of, panama, where, they, gave, rise, to, guanacos, and, related, animals, populations, of, paracamelus, continued, to, exist, in, the, north, american, arctic, into, the, early, pleistocene, this, creature, is, estimated, to, have, stood, around, nine, feet, 2, 7, metres, tall, the, bactrian, camel, diverged, from, the, dromedary, about, 1, million, years, ago, according, to, the, fossil, record, the, last, camel, native, to, north, america, was, camelops, hesternus, which, vanished, along, with, horses, short, faced, bears, mammoths, and, mastodons, ground, sloths, sabertooth, cats, and, many, other, megafauna, as, part, of, the, quaternary, extinction, event, coinciding, with, the, migration, of, humans, from, asia, at, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, around, 13, 11, 000, years, ago, an, extinct, giant, camel, species, camelus, knoblochi, roamed, asia, during, the, late, pleistocene, before, becoming, extinct, around, 20, 000, years, ago, like, horses, camels, originated, in, north, america, and, eventually, spread, across, beringia, to, asia, they, survived, in, the, old, world, and, eventually, humans, domesticated, them, and, spread, them, globally, along, with, many, other, megafauna, in, north, america, the, original, wild, camels, were, wiped, out, during, the, spread, of, the, first, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, from, asia, into, north, america, 10, to, 12, 000, years, ago, although, fossils, have, never, been, associated, with, definitive, evidence, of, hunting, most, camels, surviving, today, are, domesticated, although, feral, populations, exist, in, australia, india, and, kazakhstan, wild, camels, survive, only, in, the, wild, bactrian, camel, population, of, the, gobi, desert, when, humans, first, domesticated, camels, is, disputed, dromedaries, may, have, first, been, domesticated, by, humans, in, somalia, or, south, arabia, sometime, during, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, the, bactrian, in, central, asia, around, 2, 500, bc, as, at, shar, i, sokhta, also, known, as, the, burnt, city, iran, a, study, from, 2016, which, genotyped, and, used, world, wide, sequencing, of, modern, and, ancient, mitochondrial, dna, mtdna, suggested, that, they, were, initially, domesticated, in, the, southeast, arabian, peninsula, with, the, bactrian, type, later, being, domesticated, around, central, asia, martin, heide, s, 2010, work, on, the, domestication, of, the, camel, tentatively, concludes, that, humans, had, domesticated, the, bactrian, camel, by, at, least, the, middle, of, the, third, millennium, somewhere, east, of, the, zagros, mountains, with, the, practice, then, moving, into, mesopotamia, heide, suggests, that, mentions, of, camels, in, the, patriarchal, narratives, may, refer, at, least, in, some, places, to, the, bactrian, camel, while, noting, that, the, camel, is, not, mentioned, in, relationship, to, canaan, heide, and, joris, peters, reasserted, that, conclusion, in, their, 2021, study, on, the, subject, in, 2009, 2013, excavations, in, the, timna, valley, by, lidar, sapir, hen, and, erez, ben, yosef, discovered, what, may, be, the, earliest, domestic, camel, bones, yet, found, in, israel, or, even, outside, the, arabian, peninsula, dating, to, around, 930, bc, this, garnered, considerable, media, coverage, as, it, is, strong, evidence, that, the, stories, of, abraham, jacob, esau, and, joseph, were, written, after, this, time, the, existence, of, camels, in, mesopotamia, but, not, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, lands, is, not, a, new, idea, the, historian, richard, bulliet, did, not, think, that, the, occasional, mention, of, camels, in, the, bible, meant, that, the, domestic, camels, were, common, in, the, holy, land, at, that, time, the, archaeologist, william, f, albright, writing, even, earlier, saw, camels, in, the, bible, as, an, anachronism, the, official, report, by, sapir, hen, and, ben, joseph, says, the, introduction, of, the, dromedary, camel, camelus, dromedarius, as, a, pack, animal, to, the, southern, levant, substantially, facilitated, trade, across, the, vast, deserts, of, arabia, promoting, both, economic, and, social, change, e, g, kohler, 1984, borowski, 1998, 112, 116, jasmin, 2005, this, has, generated, extensive, discussion, regarding, the, date, of, the, earliest, domestic, camel, in, the, southern, levant, and, beyond, e, g, albright, 1949, 207, epstein, 1971, 558, 584, bulliet, 1975, zarins, 1989, k, hler, rollefson, 1993, uerpmann, and, uerpmann, 2002, jasmin, 2005, 2006, heide, 2010, rosen, and, saidel, 2010, grigson, 2012, most, scholars, today, agree, that, the, dromedary, was, exploited, as, a, pack, animal, sometime, in, the, early, iron, age, not, before, the, 12th, century, and, concludes, current, data, from, copper, smelting, sites, of, the, aravah, valley, enable, us, to, pinpoint, the, introduction, of, domestic, camels, to, the, southern, levant, more, precisely, based, on, stratigraphic, contexts, associated, with, an, extensive, suite, of, radiocarbon, dates, the, data, indicate, that, this, event, occurred, not, earlier, than, the, last, third, of, the, 10th, century, and, most, probably, during, this, time, the, coincidence, of, this, event, with, a, major, reorganization, of, the, copper, industry, of, the, region, attributed, to, the, results, of, the, campaign, of, pharaoh, shoshenq, i, raises, the, possibility, that, the, two, were, connected, and, that, camels, were, introduced, as, part, of, the, efforts, to, improve, efficiency, by, facilitating, trade, desert, tribes, and, mongolian, nomads, use, camel, hair, for, tents, yurts, clothing, bedding, and, accessories, camels, have, outer, guard, hairs, and, soft, inner, down, and, the, fibers, may, also, be, sorted, by, color, and, age, of, the, animal, the, guard, hairs, can, be, felted, for, use, as, waterproof, coats, for, the, herdsmen, while, the, softer, hair, is, used, for, premium, goods, the, fiber, can, be, spun, for, use, in, weaving, or, made, into, yarns, for, hand, knitting, or, crochet, pure, camel, hair, is, recorded, as, being, used, for, western, garments, from, the, 17th, century, onwards, and, from, the, 19th, century, a, mixture, of, wool, and, camel, hair, was, used, by, at, least, 1200, bc, the, first, camel, saddles, had, appeared, and, bactrian, camels, could, be, ridden, the, first, saddle, was, positioned, to, the, back, of, the, camel, and, control, of, the, bactrian, camel, was, exercised, by, means, of, a, stick, however, between, 500, and, 100, bc, bactrian, camels, came, into, military, use, new, saddles, which, were, inflexible, and, bent, were, put, over, the, humps, and, divided, the, rider, s, weight, over, the, animal, in, the, seventh, century, bc, the, military, arabian, saddle, evolved, which, again, improved, the, saddle, design, slightly, military, forces, have, used, camel, cavalries, in, wars, throughout, africa, the, middle, east, and, into, the, modern, day, border, security, force, bsf, of, india, though, as, of, july, 2012, the, bsf, planned, the, replacement, of, camels, with, atvs, the, first, documented, use, of, camel, cavalries, occurred, in, the, battle, of, qarqar, in, 853, bc, armies, have, also, used, camels, as, freight, animals, instead, of, horses, and, mules, the, east, roman, empire, used, auxiliary, forces, known, as, dromedarii, whom, the, romans, recruited, in, desert, provinces, the, camels, were, used, mostly, in, combat, because, of, their, ability, to, scare, off, horses, at, close, range, horses, are, afraid, of, the, camels, scent, a, quality, famously, employed, by, the, achaemenid, persians, when, fighting, lydia, in, the, battle, of, thymbra, 547, bc, the, united,
