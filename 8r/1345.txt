acne, kni, ack, nee, also, known, as, acne, vulgaris, is, a, long, term, skin, condition, that, occurs, when, dead, skin, cells, and, oil, from, the, skin, clog, hair, follicles, typical, features, of, the, condition, include, blackheads, or, whiteheads, pimples, oily, skin, and, possible, scarring, it, primarily, affects, skin, with, a, relatively, high, number, of, oil, glands, including, the, face, upper, part, of, the, chest, and, back, the, resulting, appearance, can, lead, to, lack, of, confidence, anxiety, reduced, self, esteem, and, in, extreme, cases, depression, or, thoughts, of, suicide, susceptibility, to, acne, is, primarily, genetic, in, 80, of, cases, the, roles, of, diet, and, cigarette, smoking, in, the, condition, are, unclear, and, neither, cleanliness, nor, exposure, to, sunlight, are, associated, with, acne, in, both, sexes, hormones, called, androgens, appear, to, be, part, of, the, underlying, mechanism, by, causing, increased, production, of, sebum, another, common, factor, is, the, excessive, growth, of, the, bacterium, cutibacterium, acnes, which, is, present, on, the, skin, treatments, for, acne, are, available, including, lifestyle, changes, medications, and, medical, procedures, eating, fewer, simple, carbohydrates, such, as, sugar, may, minimize, the, condition, treatments, applied, directly, to, the, affected, skin, such, as, azelaic, acid, benzoyl, peroxide, and, salicylic, acid, are, commonly, used, antibiotics, and, retinoids, are, available, in, formulations, that, are, applied, to, the, skin, and, taken, by, mouth, for, the, treatment, of, acne, however, resistance, to, antibiotics, may, develop, as, a, result, of, antibiotic, therapy, several, types, of, birth, control, pills, help, prevent, acne, in, women, medical, professionals, typically, reserve, isotretinoin, pills, for, severe, acne, due, to, greater, potential, side, effects, early, and, aggressive, treatment, of, acne, is, advocated, by, some, in, the, medical, community, to, decrease, the, overall, long, term, impact, on, individuals, in, 2015, acne, affected, approximately, 633, million, people, globally, making, it, the, eighth, most, common, disease, worldwide, acne, commonly, occurs, in, adolescence, and, affects, an, estimated, 80, 90, of, teenagers, in, the, western, world, some, rural, societies, report, lower, rates, of, acne, than, industrialized, ones, children, and, adults, may, also, be, affected, before, and, after, puberty, although, acne, becomes, less, common, in, adulthood, it, persists, in, nearly, half, of, affected, people, into, their, twenties, and, thirties, and, a, smaller, group, continues, to, have, difficulties, in, their, forties, the, severity, of, acne, vulgaris, gr, point, l, vulgaris, common, can, be, classified, as, mild, moderate, or, severe, to, determine, an, appropriate, treatment, regimen, there, is, no, universally, accepted, scale, for, grading, acne, severity, the, presence, of, clogged, skin, follicles, known, as, comedones, limited, to, the, face, with, occasional, inflammatory, lesions, defines, mild, acne, moderate, severity, acne, is, said, to, occur, when, a, higher, number, of, inflammatory, papules, and, pustules, occur, on, the, face, compared, to, mild, cases, of, acne, and, appear, on, the, trunk, of, the, body, severe, acne, is, said, to, occur, when, nodules, the, painful, bumps, lying, under, the, skin, are, the, characteristic, facial, lesions, and, involvement, of, the, trunk, is, extensive, the, lesions, are, usually, polymorphic, meaning, they, can, take, many, forms, including, open, or, closed, comedones, commonly, known, as, blackheads, and, whiteheads, papules, pustules, and, even, nodules, or, cysts, so, that, these, lesions, often, leave, behind, sequelae, or, abnormal, conditions, resulting, from, a, previous, disease, such, as, scarring, or, hyperpigmentation, large, nodules, were, previously, called, cysts, the, term, nodulocystic, has, been, used, in, the, medical, literature, to, describe, severe, cases, of, inflammatory, acne, true, cysts, are, rare, in, those, with, acne, and, the, term, severe, nodular, acne, is, now, the, preferred, terminology, acne, inversa, l, invert, upside, down, and, acne, rosacea, rosa, rose, colored, ceus, forming, are, not, forms, of, acne, and, are, alternate, names, that, respectively, refer, to, the, skin, conditions, hidradenitis, suppurativa, hs, and, rosacea, although, hs, shares, certain, overlapping, features, with, acne, vulgaris, such, as, a, tendency, to, clog, skin, follicles, with, skin, cell, debris, the, condition, otherwise, lacks, the, hallmark, features, of, acne, and, is, therefore, considered, a, distinct, skin, disorder, typical, features, of, acne, include, increased, secretion, of, oily, sebum, by, the, skin, microcomedones, comedones, papules, nodules, large, papules, pustules, and, often, results, in, scarring, the, appearance, of, acne, varies, with, skin, color, it, may, result, in, psychological, and, social, problems, acne, scars, are, caused, by, inflammation, within, the, dermis, and, are, estimated, to, affect, 95, of, people, with, acne, vulgaris, abnormal, healing, and, dermal, inflammation, create, the, scar, scarring, is, most, likely, to, take, place, with, severe, acne, but, may, occur, with, any, form, of, acne, vulgaris, acne, scars, are, classified, based, on, whether, the, abnormal, healing, response, following, dermal, inflammation, leads, to, excess, collagen, deposition, or, loss, at, the, site, of, the, acne, lesion, atrophic, acne, scars, have, lost, collagen, from, the, healing, response, and, are, the, most, common, type, of, acne, scar, accounting, for, approximately, 75, of, all, acne, scars, ice, pick, scars, boxcar, scars, and, rolling, scars, are, subtypes, of, atrophic, acne, scars, boxcar, scars, are, round, or, ovoid, indented, scars, with, sharp, borders, and, vary, in, size, from, 1, 5, 4, mm, across, ice, pick, scars, are, narrow, less, than, 2, mm, across, deep, scars, that, extend, into, the, dermis, rolling, scars, are, broader, than, ice, pick, and, boxcar, scars, 4, 5, mm, across, and, have, a, wave, like, pattern, of, depth, in, the, skin, hypertrophic, scars, are, uncommon, and, are, characterized, by, increased, collagen, content, after, the, abnormal, healing, response, they, are, described, as, firm, and, raised, from, the, skin, hypertrophic, scars, remain, within, the, original, margins, of, the, wound, whereas, keloid, scars, can, form, scar, tissue, outside, of, these, borders, keloid, scars, from, acne, occur, more, often, in, men, and, people, with, darker, skin, and, usually, occur, on, the, trunk, of, the, body, in, november, 2021, a, study, was, published, exposing, the, consensus, of, twenty, four, renowned, international, plastic, surgeons, and, dermatologists, about, the, most, effective, energy, based, devices, for, the, treatment, of, acne, scars, after, an, inflamed, nodular, acne, lesion, resolves, it, is, common, for, the, skin, to, darken, in, that, area, which, is, known, as, postinflammatory, hyperpigmentation, pih, the, inflammation, stimulates, specialized, pigment, producing, skin, cells, known, as, melanocytes, to, produce, more, melanin, pigment, which, leads, to, the, skin, s, darkened, appearance, pih, occurs, more, frequently, in, people, with, darker, skin, color, pigmented, scar, is, a, common, term, used, for, pih, but, is, misleading, as, it, suggests, the, color, change, is, permanent, often, pih, can, be, prevented, by, avoiding, any, aggravation, of, the, nodule, and, can, fade, with, time, however, untreated, pih, can, last, for, months, years, or, even, be, permanent, if, deeper, layers, of, skin, are, affected, even, minimal, skin, exposure, to, the, sun, s, ultraviolet, rays, can, sustain, hyperpigmentation, daily, use, of, spf, 15, or, higher, sunscreen, can, minimize, such, a, risk, whitening, agents, like, azelaic, acid, arbutin, or, else, may, be, used, to, improve, hyperpigmentation, risk, factors, for, the, development, of, acne, other, than, genetics, have, not, been, conclusively, identified, possible, secondary, contributors, include, hormones, infections, diet, and, stress, studies, investigating, the, impact, of, smoking, on, the, incidence, and, severity, of, acne, have, been, inconclusive, cleanliness, hygiene, and, sunlight, are, not, associated, with, acne, acne, appears, to, be, highly, heritable, genetics, explain, 81, of, the, variation, in, the, population, studies, performed, in, affected, twins, and, first, degree, relatives, further, demonstrate, the, strongly, inherited, nature, of, acne, acne, susceptibility, is, likely, due, to, the, influence, of, multiple, genes, as, the, disease, does, not, follow, a, classic, mendelian, inheritance, pattern, these, gene, candidates, include, certain, variations, in, tumor, necrosis, factor, alpha, tnf, alpha, il, 1, alpha, and, cyp1a1, genes, among, others, the, 308, g, a, single, nucleotide, polymorphism, variation, in, the, gene, for, tnf, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, for, acne, acne, can, be, a, feature, of, rare, genetic, disorders, such, as, apert, s, syndrome, severe, acne, may, be, associated, with, xyy, syndrome, hormonal, activity, such, as, occurs, during, menstrual, cycles, and, puberty, may, contribute, to, the, formation, of, acne, during, puberty, an, increase, in, sex, hormones, called, androgens, causes, the, skin, follicle, glands, to, grow, larger, and, make, more, oily, sebum, the, androgen, hormones, testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, dht, and, dehydroepiandrosterone, dhea, are, all, linked, to, acne, high, levels, of, growth, hormone, gh, and, insulin, like, growth, factor, 1, igf, 1, are, also, associated, with, worsened, acne, both, androgens, and, igf, 1, seem, to, be, essential, for, acne, to, occur, as, acne, does, not, develop, in, individuals, with, complete, androgen, insensitivity, syndrome, cais, or, laron, syndrome, insensitivity, to, gh, resulting, in, very, low, igf, 1, levels, medical, conditions, that, commonly, cause, a, high, androgen, state, such, as, polycystic, ovary, syndrome, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, and, androgen, secreting, tumors, can, cause, acne, in, affected, individuals, conversely, people, who, lack, androgenic, hormones, or, are, insensitive, to, the, effects, of, androgens, rarely, have, acne, pregnancy, can, increase, androgen, levels, and, consequently, oily, sebum, synthesis, acne, can, be, a, side, effect, of, testosterone, replacement, therapy, or, anabolic, steroid, use, over, the, counter, bodybuilding, and, dietary, supplements, often, contain, illegally, added, anabolic, steroids, the, anaerobic, bacterial, species, cutibacterium, acnes, formerly, propionibacterium, acnes, contributes, to, the, development, of, acne, but, its, exact, role, is, not, well, understood, there, are, specific, sub, strains, of, c, acnes, associated, with, normal, skin, and, others, with, moderate, or, severe, inflammatory, acne, it, is, unclear, whether, these, undesirable, strains, evolve, on, site, or, are, acquired, or, possibly, both, depending, on, the, person, these, strains, have, the, capability, of, changing, perpetuating, or, adapting, to, the, abnormal, cycle, of, inflammation, oil, production, and, inadequate, sloughing, of, dead, skin, cells, from, acne, pores, infection, with, the, parasitic, mite, demodex, is, associated, with, the, development, of, acne, it, is, unclear, whether, eradication, of, the, mite, improves, acne, high, glycemic, load, diets, have, been, found, to, have, different, degrees, of, effect, on, acne, severity, multiple, randomized, controlled, trials, and, nonrandomized, studies, have, found, a, lower, glycemic, load, diet, to, be, effective, in, reducing, acne, there, is, weak, observational, evidence, suggesting, that, dairy, milk, consumption, is, positively, associated, with, a, higher, frequency, and, severity, of, acne, milk, contains, whey, protein, and, hormones, such, as, bovine, igf, 1, and, precursors, of, dihydrotestosterone, studies, suggest, these, components, promote, the, effects, of, insulin, and, igf, 1, and, thereby, increase, the, production, of, androgen, hormones, sebum, and, promote, the, formation, of, comedones, available, evidence, does, not, support, a, link, between, eating, chocolate, or, salt, and, acne, severity, few, studies, have, examined, the, relationship, between, obesity, and, acne, vitamin, b, 12, may, trigger, skin, outbreaks, similar, to, acne, acneiform, eruptions, or, worsen, existing, acne, when, taken, in, doses, exceeding, the, recommended, daily, intake, there, are, few, high, quality, studies, to, demonstrate, that, stress, causes, or, worsens, acne, despite, being, controversial, some, research, indicates, that, increased, acne, severity, is, associated, with, high, stress, levels, in, certain, contexts, such, as, hormonal, changes, seen, in, premenstrual, syndrome, some, individuals, experience, severe, intensification, of, their, acne, when, they, are, exposed, to, hot, humid, climates, this, is, due, to, bacteria, and, fungus, thriving, in, warm, moist, environments, this, climate, induced, acne, exacerbation, has, been, termed, tropical, acne, mechanical, obstruction, of, skin, follicles, with, helmets, or, chinstraps, can, worsen, pre, existing, acne, however, acne, caused, by, mechanical, obstruction, is, technically, not, acne, vulgaris, but, another, acneiform, eruption, known, as, acne, mechanica, several, medications, can, also, worsen, pre, existing, acne, this, condition, is, the, acne, medicamentosa, form, of, acne, examples, of, such, medications, include, lithium, hydantoin, isoniazid, glucocorticoids, iodides, bromides, and, testosterone, when, acne, medicamentosa, is, specifically, caused, by, anabolic, androgenic, steroids, it, can, simply, be, referred, to, as, steroid, acne, genetically, susceptible, individuals, can, get, acne, breakouts, as, a, result, of, polymorphous, light, eruption, a, condition, triggered, by, sunlight, and, artificial, uv, light, exposure, this, form, of, acne, is, called, acne, aestivalis, and, is, specifically, caused, by, intense, uva, light, exposure, affected, individuals, usually, experience, seasonal, acne, breakouts, on, their, upper, arms, shoulder, girdle, back, and, chest, the, breakouts, typically, occur, one, to, three, days, after, exposure, to, intese, uva, radiation, unlike, other, forms, of, acne, the, condition, spares, the, face, this, could, possibly, be, a, result, of, the, pathogenesis, of, polymorphous, light, eruption, in, which, areas, of, the, skin, that, are, newly, exposed, to, intense, ultraviolet, radiation, are, affected, since, faces, are, typically, left, uncovered, at, all, stages, of, life, there, is, little, to, no, likelihood, for, an, eruption, to, appear, there, studies, show, that, both, polymorphous, light, eruption, outbreaks, and, the, acne, aestivalis, breakout, response, can, be, prevented, by, topical, antioxidants, combined, with, the, application, of, a, broad, spectrum, sunscreen, acne, vulgaris, is, a, chronic, skin, disease, of, the, pilosebaceous, unit, and, develops, due, to, blockages, in, the, skin, s, hair, follicles, traditionally, seen, as, a, disease, of, adolescence, acne, vulgaris, is, also, observed, in, adults, including, post, menopausal, women, acne, vulgaris, manifested, in, adult, female, is, called, adult, female, acne, afa, defined, as, a, chronic, inflammatory, disease, of, the, pilosebaceous, unit, particularly, in, afa, during, the, menopausal, transition, a, relative, increase, in, androgen, levels, occurs, as, estrogen, levels, begin, to, decline, so, that, this, hormonal, shift, can, manifest, as, acne, while, most, women, with, afa, exhibit, few, acne, lesions, and, have, normal, androgen, levels, baseline, investigations, including, an, androgen, testing, panel, can, help, rule, out, associated, comorbidities, such, as, polycystic, ovarian, syndrome, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, or, tumors, the, blockages, in, the, skin, s, hair, follicles, that, cause, acne, vulgaris, manifestations, occur, as, a, result, of, the, following, four, abnormal, processes, increased, oily, sebum, production, influenced, by, androgens, excessive, deposition, of, the, protein, keratin, leading, to, comedo, formation, colonization, of, the, follicle, by, cutibacterium, acnes, c, acnes, bacteria, and, the, local, release, of, pro, inflammatory, chemicals, in, the, skin, the, earliest, pathologic, change, is, the, formation, of, a, plug, a, microcomedone, which, is, driven, primarily, by, excessive, growth, reproduction, and, accumulation, of, skin, cells, in, the, hair, follicle, in, healthy, skin, the, skin, cells, that, have, died, come, up, to, the, surface, and, exit, the, pore, of, the, hair, follicle, in, people, with, acne, the, increased, production, of, oily, sebum, causes, the, dead, skin, cells, to, stick, together, the, accumulation, of, dead, skin, cell, debris, and, oily, sebum, blocks, the, pore, of, the, hair, follicle, thus, forming, the, microcomedone, the, c, acnes, biofilm, within, the, hair, follicle, worsens, this, process, if, the, microcomedone, is, superficial, within, the, hair, follicle, the, skin, pigment, melanin, is, exposed, to, air, resulting, in, its, oxidation, and, dark, appearance, known, as, a, blackhead, or, open, comedo, in, contrast, if, the, microcomedone, occurs, deep, within, the, hair, follicle, this, causes, the, formation, of, a, whitehead, known, as, a, closed, comedo, the, main, hormonal, driver, of, oily, sebum, production, in, the, skin, is, dihydrotestosterone, another, androgenic, hormone, responsible, for, increased, sebaceous, gland, activity, is, dhea, s, the, adrenal, glands, secrete, higher, amounts, of, dhea, s, during, adrenarche, a, stage, of, puberty, and, this, leads, to, an, increase, in, sebum, production, in, a, sebum, rich, skin, environment, the, naturally, occurring, and, largely, commensal, skin, bacterium, c, acnes, readily, grows, and, can, cause, inflammation, within, and, around, the, follicle, due, to, activation, of, the, innate, immune, system, c, acnes, triggers, skin, inflammation, in, acne, by, increasing, the, production, of, several, pro, inflammatory, chemical, signals, such, as, il, 1, il, 8, tnf, and, ltb4, il, 1, is, essential, to, comedo, formation, c, acnes, ability, to, bind, and, activate, a, class, of, immune, system, receptors, known, as, toll, like, receptors, tlrs, especially, tlr2, and, tlr4, is, a, core, mechanism, of, acne, related, skin, inflammation, activation, of, tlr2, and, tlr4, by, c, acnes, leads, to, increased, secretion, of, il, 1, il, 8, and, tnf, the, release, of, these, inflammatory, signals, attracts, various, immune, cells, to, the, hair, follicle, including, neutrophils, macrophages, and, th1, cells, il, 1, stimulates, increased, skin, cell, activity, and, reproduction, which, in, turn, fuels, comedo, development, furthermore, sebaceous, gland, cells, produce, more, antimicrobial, peptides, such, as, hbd1, and, hbd2, in, response, to, the, binding, of, tlr2, and, tlr4, c, acnes, also, provokes, skin, inflammation, by, altering, the, fatty, composition, of, oily, sebum, oxidation, of, the, lipid, squalene, by, c, acnes, is, of, particular, importance, squalene, oxidation, activates, nf, b, a, protein, complex, and, consequently, increases, il, 1, levels, additionally, squalene, oxidation, increases, 5, lipoxygenase, enzyme, activity, which, catalyzes, the, conversion, of, arachidonic, acid, to, leukotriene, b4, ltb4, ltb4, promotes, skin, inflammation, by, acting, on, the, peroxisome, proliferator, activated, receptor, alpha, ppar, protein, ppar, increases, the, activity, of, activator, protein, 1, ap, 1, and, nf, b, thereby, leading, to, the, recruitment, of, inflammatory, t, cells, c, acnes, ability, to, convert, sebum, triglycerides, to, pro, inflammatory, free, fatty, acids, via, secretion, of, the, enzyme, lipase, further, explains, its, inflammatory, properties, these, free, fatty, acids, spur, increased, production, of, cathelicidin, hbd1, and, hbd2, thus, leading, to, further, inflammation, this, inflammatory, cascade, typically, leads, to, the, formation, of, inflammatory, acne, lesions, including, papules, infected, pustules, or, nodules, if, the, inflammatory, reaction, is, severe, the, follicle, can, break, into, the, deeper, layers, of, the, dermis, and, subcutaneous, tissue, and, cause, the, formation, of, deep, nodules, the, involvement, of, ap, 1, in, the, aforementioned, inflammatory, cascade, activates, matrix, metalloproteinases, which, contribute, to, local, tissue, destruction, and, scar, formation, along, with, the, bacteria, c, acnes, the, bacterial, species, staphylococcus, epidermidis, s, epidermidis, also, takes, a, part, in, the, physiopathology, of, acne, vulgaris, the, proliferation, of, s, epidermidis, with, c, acnes, causes, the, formation, of, biofilms, which, blocks, the, hair, follicles, and, pores, creating, an, anaerobic, environment, under, the, skin, this, enables, for, increased, growth, of, both, c, acnes, and, s, epidermidis, under, the, skin, the, proliferation, of, c, acnes, causes, the, formation, of, biofilms, and, a, biofilm, matrix, making, it, even, harder, to, treat, the, acne, acne, vulgaris, is, diagnosed, based, on, a, medical, professional, s, clinical, judgment, the, evaluation, of, a, person, with, suspected, acne, should, include, taking, a, detailed, medical, history, about, a, family, history, of, acne, a, review, of, medications, taken, signs, or, symptoms, of, excessive, production, of, androgen, hormones, cortisol, and, growth, hormone, comedones, blackheads, and, whiteheads, must, be, present, to, diagnose, acne, in, their, absence, an, appearance, similar, to, that, of, acne, would, suggest, a, different, skin, disorder, microcomedones, the, precursor, to, blackheads, and, whiteheads, are, not, visible, to, the, naked, eye, when, inspecting, the, skin, and, require, a, microscope, to, be, seen, many, features, may, indicate, that, a, person, s, acne, vulgaris, is, sensitive, to, hormonal, influences, historical, and, physical, clues, that, may, suggest, hormone, sensitive, acne, include, onset, between, ages, 20, and, 30, worsening, the, week, before, a, woman, s, period, acne, lesions, predominantly, over, the, jawline, and, chin, and, inflammatory, nodular, acne, lesions, several, scales, exist, to, grade, the, severity, of, acne, vulgaris, but, disagreement, persists, about, the, ideal, one, for, diagnostic, use, cook, s, acne, grading, scale, uses, photographs, to, grade, severity, from, 0, to, 8, with, higher, numbers, representing, more, severe, acne, this, scale, was, the, first, to, use, a, standardized, photographic, protocol, to, assess, acne, severity, since, its, creation, in, 1979, the, scale, has, undergone, several, revisions, the, leeds, acne, grading, technique, counts, acne, lesions, on, the, face, back, and, chest, and, categorizes, them, as, inflammatory, or, non, inflammatory, leeds, scores, range, from, 0, least, severe, to, 10, most, severe, though, modified, scales, have, a, maximum, score, of, 12, the, pillsbury, acne, grading, scale, classifies, the, severity, of, the, acne, from, grade, 1, least, severe, to, grade, 4, most, severe, many, skin, conditions, can, mimic, acne, vulgaris, and, these, are, collectively, known, as, acneiform, eruptions, such, conditions, include, angiofibromas, epidermal, cysts, flat, warts, folliculitis, keratosis, pilaris, milia, perioral, dermatitis, and, rosacea, among, others, age, is, one, factor, that, may, help, distinguish, between, these, disorders, skin, disorders, such, as, perioral, dermatitis, and, keratosis, pilaris, can, appear, similar, to, acne, but, tend, to, occur, more, frequently, in, childhood, rosacea, tends, to, occur, more, frequently, in, older, adults, facial, redness, triggered, by, heat, or, the, consumption, of, alcohol, or, spicy, food, is, also, more, suggestive, of, rosacea, the, presence, of, comedones, helps, health, professionals, differentiate, acne, from, skin, disorders, that, are, similar, in, appearance, chloracne, and, occupational, acne, due, to, exposure, to, certain, chemicals, industrial, compounds, may, look, very, similar, to, acne, vulgaris, many, different, treatments, exist, for, acne, these, include, alpha, hydroxy, acid, anti, androgen, medications, antibiotics, antiseborrheic, medications, azelaic, acid, benzoyl, peroxide, hormonal, treatments, keratolytic, soaps, nicotinamide, retinoids, and, salicylic, acid, acne, treatments, work, in, at, least, four, different, ways, including, the, following, reducing, inflammation, hormonal, manipulation, killing, c, acnes, and, normalizing, skin, cell, shedding, and, sebum, production, in, the, pore, to, prevent, blockage, typical, treatments, include, topical, therapies, such, as, antibiotics, benzoyl, peroxide, and, retinoids, and, systemic, therapies, including, antibiotics, hormonal, agents, and, oral, retinoids, recommended, therapies, for, first, line, use, in, acne, vulgaris, treatment, include, topical, retinoids, benzoyl, peroxide, and, topical, or, oral, antibiotics, procedures, such, as, light, therapy, and, laser, therapy, are, not, first, line, treatments, and, typically, have, only, an, add, on, role, due, to, their, high, cost, and, limited, evidence, blue, light, therapy, is, of, unclear, benefit, medications, for, acne, target, the, early, stages, of, comedo, formation, and, are, generally, ineffective, for, visible, skin, lesions, acne, generally, improves, between, eight, and, twelve, weeks, after, starting, therapy, people, often, view, acne, as, a, short, term, condition, some, expecting, it, to, disappear, after, puberty, this, misconception, can, lead, to, depending, on, self, management, or, problems, with, long, term, adherence, to, treatment, communicating, the, long, term, nature, of, the, condition, and, better, access, to, reliable, information, about, acne, can, help, people, know, what, to, expect, from, treatments, in, general, it, is, recommended, that, people, with, acne, do, not, wash, affected, skin, more, than, twice, daily, the, application, of, a, fragrance, free, moisturizer, to, sensitive, and, acne, prone, skin, may, reduce, irritation, skin, irritation, from, acne, medications, typically, peaks, at, two, weeks, after, onset, of, use, and, tends, to, improve, with, continued, use, dermatologists, recommend, using, cosmetic, products, that, specifically, say, non, comedogenic, oil, free, and, will, not, clog, pores, acne, vulgaris, patients, even, those, with, oily, skin, should, moisturize, in, order, to, support, the, skin, s, moisture, barrier, since, skin, barrier, dysfunction, may, contribute, to, acne, moisturizers, especially, ceramide, containing, moisturizers, as, an, adjunct, therapy, are, particularly, helpful, for, the, dry, skin, and, irritation, that, commonly, results, from, topical, acne, treatment, studies, show, that, ceramide, containing, moisturizers, are, important, for, optimal, skin, care, they, enhance, acne, therapy, adherence, and, complement, existing, acne, therapies, in, a, study, where, acne, patients, used, 1, 2, clindamycin, phosphate, 2, 5, benzoyl, peroxide, gel, in, the, morning, and, applied, a, micronized, 0, 05, tretinoin, gel, in, the, evening, the, overwhelming, majority, of, patients, experienced, no, cutaneous, adverse, events, throughout, the, study, it, was, concluded, that, using, ceramide, cleanser, and, ceramide, moisturizing, cream, caused, the, favorable, tolerability, did, not, interfere, with, the, treatment, efficacy, and, improved, adherence, to, the, regimen, the, importance, of, preserving, the, acidic, mantle, and, its, barrier, functions, is, widely, accepted, in, the, scientific, community, thus,

including, acne, researchers, observed, a, link, between, high, glycemic, index, diets, and, acne, dermatologists, also, recommend, a, diet, low, in, simple, sugars, as, a, method, of, improving, acne, as, of, 2014, the, available, evidence, is, insufficient, to, use, milk, restriction, for, this, purpose, benzoyl, peroxide, bpo, is, a, first, line, treatment, for, mild, and, moderate, acne, due, to, its, effectiveness, and, mild, side, effects, mainly, skin, irritation, in, the, skin, follicle, benzoyl, peroxide, kills, c, acnes, by, oxidizing, its, proteins, through, the, formation, of, oxygen, free, radicals, and, benzoic, acid, these, free, radicals, likely, interfere, with, the, bacterium, s, metabolism, and, ability, to, make, proteins, additionally, benzoyl, peroxide, is, mildly, effective, at, breaking, down, comedones, and, inhibiting, inflammation, combination, products, use, benzoyl, peroxide, with, a, topical, antibiotic, or, retinoid, such, as, benzoyl, peroxide, clindamycin, and, benzoyl, peroxide, adapalene, respectively, topical, benzoyl, peroxide, is, effective, at, treating, acne, side, effects, include, increased, skin, photosensitivity, dryness, redness, and, occasional, peeling, sunscreen, use, is, often, advised, during, treatment, to, prevent, sunburn, lower, concentrations, of, benzoyl, peroxide, are, just, as, effective, as, higher, concentrations, in, treating, acne, but, are, associated, with, fewer, side, effects, unlike, antibiotics, benzoyl, peroxide, does, not, appear, to, generate, bacterial, antibiotic, resistance, retinoids, are, medications, that, reduce, inflammation, normalize, the, follicle, cell, life, cycle, and, reduce, sebum, production, they, are, structurally, related, to, vitamin, a, studies, show, dermatologists, and, primary, care, doctors, underprescribe, them, for, acne, the, retinoids, appear, to, influence, the, cell, life, cycle, in, the, follicle, lining, this, helps, prevent, the, accumulation, of, skin, cells, within, the, hair, follicle, that, can, create, a, blockage, they, are, a, first, line, acne, treatment, especially, for, people, with, dark, colored, skin, retinoids, are, known, to, lead, to, faster, improvement, of, postinflammatory, hyperpigmentation, topical, retinoids, include, adapalene, retinol, retinaldehyde, isotretinoin, tazarotene, trifarotene, and, tretinoin, they, often, cause, an, initial, flare, up, of, acne, and, facial, flushing, and, can, cause, significant, skin, irritation, generally, speaking, retinoids, increase, the, skin, s, sensitivity, to, sunlight, and, are, therefore, recommended, for, use, at, night, tretinoin, is, the, least, expensive, of, the, topical, retinoids, and, is, the, most, irritating, to, the, skin, whereas, adapalene, is, the, least, irritating, but, costs, significantly, more, most, formulations, of, tretinoin, are, incompatible, for, use, with, benzoyl, peroxide, tazarotene, is, the, most, effective, and, expensive, topical, retinoid, but, is, usually, not, as, well, tolerated, in, 2019, a, tazarotene, lotion, formulation, marketed, to, be, a, less, irritating, option, was, approved, by, the, fda, retinol, is, a, form, of, vitamin, a, that, has, similar, but, milder, effects, and, is, present, in, many, over, the, counter, moisturizers, and, other, topical, products, isotretinoin, is, an, oral, retinoid, that, is, very, effective, for, severe, nodular, acne, and, moderate, acne, that, is, stubborn, to, other, treatments, one, to, two, months, of, use, is, typically, adequate, to, see, improvement, acne, often, resolves, completely, or, is, much, milder, after, a, 4, 6, month, course, of, oral, isotretinoin, after, a, single, round, of, treatment, about, 80, of, people, report, an, improvement, with, more, than, 50, reporting, complete, remission, about, 20, of, people, require, a, second, course, but, 80, of, those, report, improvement, resulting, in, a, cumulative, 96, efficacy, rate, there, are, concerns, that, isotretinoin, is, linked, to, adverse, effects, like, depression, suicidality, and, anemia, there, is, no, clear, evidence, to, support, some, of, these, claims, isotretinoin, has, been, found, in, some, studies, to, be, superior, to, antibiotics, or, placebo, in, reducing, acne, lesions, however, a, 2018, review, comparing, inflammatory, lesions, after, treatment, with, antibiotics, or, isotretinoin, found, no, difference, the, frequency, of, adverse, events, was, about, twice, as, high, with, isotretinoin, use, although, these, were, mostly, dryness, related, events, no, increased, risk, of, suicide, or, depression, was, conclusively, found, medical, authorities, strictly, regulate, isotretinoin, use, in, women, of, childbearing, age, due, to, its, known, harmful, effects, in, pregnancy, for, such, a, woman, to, be, considered, a, candidate, for, isotretinoin, she, must, have, a, confirmed, negative, pregnancy, test, and, use, an, effective, form, of, birth, control, in, 2008, the, united, states, started, the, ipledge, program, to, prevent, isotretinoin, use, during, pregnancy, ipledge, requires, the, woman, to, have, two, negative, pregnancy, tests, and, to, use, two, types, of, birth, control, for, at, least, one, month, before, isotretinoin, therapy, begins, and, one, month, afterward, the, effectiveness, of, the, ipledge, program, is, controversial, due, to, continued, instances, of, contraception, nonadherence, people, may, apply, antibiotics, to, the, skin, or, take, them, orally, to, treat, acne, they, work, by, killing, c, acnes, and, reducing, inflammation, although, multiple, guidelines, call, for, healthcare, providers, to, reduce, the, rates, of, prescribed, oral, antibiotics, many, providers, do, not, follow, this, guidance, oral, antibiotics, remain, the, most, commonly, prescribed, systemic, therapy, for, acne, widespread, broad, spectrum, antibiotic, overuse, for, acne, has, led, to, higher, rates, of, antibiotic, resistant, c, acnes, strains, worldwide, especially, to, the, commonly, used, tetracycline, e, g, doxycycline, and, macrolide, antibiotics, e, g, topical, erythromycin, therefore, dermatologists, prefer, antibiotics, as, part, of, combination, therapy, and, not, for, use, alone, commonly, used, antibiotics, either, applied, to, the, skin, or, taken, orally, include, clindamycin, erythromycin, metronidazole, sulfacetamide, and, tetracyclines, e, g, doxycycline, or, minocycline, doxycycline, 40, milligrams, daily, low, dose, appears, to, have, similar, efficacy, to, 100, milligrams, daily, and, has, fewer, gastrointestinal, side, effects, however, low, dose, doxycycline, is, not, fda, approved, for, the, treatment, of, acne, antibiotics, applied, to, the, skin, are, typically, used, for, mild, to, moderately, severe, acne, oral, antibiotics, are, generally, more, effective, than, topical, antibiotics, and, produce, faster, resolution, of, inflammatory, acne, lesions, than, topical, applications, the, global, alliance, to, improve, outcomes, in, acne, recommends, that, topical, and, oral, antibiotics, are, not, used, together, oral, antibiotics, are, recommended, for, no, longer, than, three, months, as, antibiotic, courses, exceeding, this, duration, are, associated, with, the, development, of, antibiotic, resistance, and, show, no, clear, benefit, over, shorter, durations, if, long, term, oral, antibiotics, beyond, three, months, are, used, then, it, is, recommended, that, benzoyl, peroxide, or, a, retinoid, be, used, at, the, same, time, to, limit, the, risk, of, c, acnes, developing, antibiotic, resistance, the, antibiotic, dapsone, is, effective, against, inflammatory, acne, when, applied, to, the, skin, it, is, generally, not, a, first, line, choice, due, to, its, higher, cost, and, a, lack, of, clear, superiority, over, other, antibiotics, topical, dapsone, is, sometimes, a, preferred, therapy, in, women, or, for, people, with, sensitive, or, darker, toned, skin, it, is, not, recommended, for, use, with, benzoyl, peroxide, due, to, the, risk, of, causing, yellow, orange, skin, discoloration, with, this, combination, minocycline, is, an, effective, acne, treatment, but, it, is, not, a, first, line, antibiotic, due, to, a, lack, of, evidence, that, it, is, better, than, other, treatments, and, concerns, about, its, safety, compared, to, other, tetracyclines, sarecycline, is, the, most, recent, oral, antibiotic, developed, specifically, for, the, treatment, of, acne, and, is, fda, approved, for, the, treatment, of, moderate, to, severe, inflammatory, acne, in, patients, nine, years, of, age, and, older, it, is, a, narrow, spectrum, tetracycline, antibiotic, that, exhibits, the, necessary, antibacterial, activity, against, pathogens, related, to, acne, vulgaris, and, a, low, propensity, for, inducing, antibiotic, resistance, in, clinical, trials, sarecycline, demonstrated, clinical, efficacy, in, reducing, inflammatory, acne, lesions, as, early, as, three, weeks, and, reduced, truncal, back, and, chest, acne, in, women, the, use, of, combined, birth, control, pills, can, improve, acne, these, medications, contain, an, estrogen, and, a, progestin, they, work, by, decreasing, the, production, of, androgen, hormones, by, the, ovaries, and, by, decreasing, the, free, and, hence, biologically, active, fractions, of, androgens, resulting, in, lowered, skin, production, of, sebum, and, consequently, reduce, acne, severity, first, generation, progestins, such, as, norethindrone, and, norgestrel, have, androgenic, properties, and, may, worsen, acne, although, oral, estrogens, decrease, igf, 1, levels, in, some, situations, which, could, theoretically, improve, acne, symptoms, combined, birth, control, pills, do, not, appear, to, affect, igf, 1, levels, in, fertile, women, cyproterone, acetate, containing, birth, control, pills, seem, to, decrease, total, and, free, igf, 1, levels, combinations, containing, third, or, fourth, generation, progestins, including, desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, or, norgestimate, as, well, as, birth, control, pills, containing, cyproterone, acetate, or, chlormadinone, acetate, are, preferred, for, women, with, acne, due, to, their, stronger, antiandrogenic, effects, studies, have, shown, a, 40, to, 70, reduction, in, acne, lesions, with, combined, birth, control, pills, a, 2014, review, found, that, oral, antibiotics, appear, to, be, somewhat, more, effective, than, birth, control, pills, at, reducing, the, number, of, inflammatory, acne, lesions, at, three, months, however, the, two, therapies, are, approximately, equal, in, efficacy, at, six, months, for, decreasing, the, number, of, inflammatory, non, inflammatory, and, total, acne, lesions, the, authors, of, the, analysis, suggested, that, birth, control, pills, may, be, a, preferred, first, line, acne, treatment, over, oral, antibiotics, in, certain, women, due, to, similar, efficacy, at, six, months, and, a, lack, of, associated, antibiotic, resistance, in, contrast, to, combined, birth, control, pills, progestogen, only, birth, control, forms, that, contain, androgenic, progestins, have, been, associated, with, worsened, acne, antiandrogens, such, as, cyproterone, acetate, and, spironolactone, can, successfully, treat, acne, especially, in, women, with, signs, of, excessive, androgen, production, such, as, increased, hairiness, or, skin, production, of, sebum, or, scalp, hair, loss, spironolactone, is, an, effective, treatment, for, acne, in, adult, women, unlike, combined, birth, control, pills, it, is, not, approved, by, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, for, this, purpose, spironolactone, is, an, aldosterone, antagonist, and, is, a, useful, acne, treatment, due, to, its, ability, to, additionally, block, the, androgen, receptor, at, higher, doses, alone, or, in, combination, with, a, birth, control, pill, spironolactone, has, shown, a, 33, to, 85, reduction, in, acne, lesions, in, women, the, effectiveness, of, spironolactone, for, acne, appears, to, be, dose, dependent, high, dose, cyproterone, acetate, alone, reportedly, decreases, acne, symptoms, in, women, by, 75, to, 90, within, three, months, it, is, usually, combined, with, an, estrogen, to, avoid, menstrual, irregularities, and, estrogen, deficiency, the, medication, appears, to, be, effective, in, the, treatment, of, acne, in, males, with, one, study, finding, that, a, high, dosage, reduced, inflammatory, acne, lesions, by, 73, however, spironolactone, and, cyproterone, acetate, s, side, effects, in, males, such, as, gynecomastia, sexual, dysfunction, and, decreased, bone, mineral, density, generally, make, their, use, for, male, acne, impractical, pregnant, and, lactating, women, should, not, receive, antiandrogens, for, their, acne, due, to, a, possibility, of, birth, disorders, such, as, hypospadias, and, feminization, of, male, babies, women, who, are, sexually, active, and, who, can, or, may, become, pregnant, should, use, an, effective, method, of, contraception, to, prevent, pregnancy, while, taking, an, antiandrogen, antiandrogens, are, often, combined, with, birth, control, pills, for, this, reason, which, can, result, in, additive, efficacy, the, fda, added, a, black, box, warning, to, spironolactone, about, possible, tumor, risks, based, on, preclinical, research, with, very, high, doses, 100, fold, clinical, doses, and, cautioned, that, unnecessary, use, of, the, medication, should, be, avoided, however, several, large, epidemiological, studies, subsequently, found, no, greater, risk, of, tumors, in, association, with, spironolactone, in, humans, conversely, strong, associations, of, cyproterone, acetate, with, certain, brain, tumors, have, been, discovered, and, its, use, has, been, restricted, the, brain, tumor, risk, with, cyproterone, acetate, is, due, to, its, strong, progestogenic, actions, and, is, not, related, to, antiandrogenic, activity, nor, shared, by, other, antiandrogens, flutamide, a, pure, antagonist, of, the, androgen, receptor, is, effective, in, treating, acne, in, women, it, appears, to, reduce, acne, symptoms, by, 80, to, 90, even, at, low, doses, with, several, studies, showing, complete, acne, clearance, in, one, study, flutamide, decreased, acne, scores, by, 80, within, three, months, whereas, spironolactone, decreased, symptoms, by, only, 40, in, the, same, period, in, a, large, long, term, study, 97, of, women, reported, satisfaction, with, the, control, of, their, acne, with, flutamide, although, effective, flutamide, has, a, risk, of, serious, liver, toxicity, and, cases, of, death, in, women, taking, even, low, doses, of, the, medication, to, treat, androgen, dependent, skin, and, hair, conditions, have, occurred, as, such, the, use, of, flutamide, for, acne, has, become, increasingly, limited, and, it, has, been, argued, that, continued, use, of, flutamide, for, such, purposes, is, unethical, bicalutamide, a, pure, androgen, receptor, antagonist, with, the, same, mechanism, as, flutamide, and, with, comparable, or, superior, antiandrogenic, efficacy, but, with, a, far, lower, risk, of, liver, toxicity, is, an, alternative, option, to, flutamide, in,

both, males, and, females, and, was, approved, for, clinical, use, for, this, indication, in, august, 2020, it, has, shown, no, systemic, absorption, or, associated, antiandrogenic, side, effects, in, a, small, direct, head, to, head, comparison, clascoterone, showed, greater, effectiveness, than, topical, isotretinoin, 5, reductase, inhibitors, such, as, finasteride, and, dutasteride, may, be, useful, for, the, treatment, of, acne, in, both, males, and, females, but, have, not, been, adequately, evaluated, for, this, purpose, moreover, 5, reductase, inhibitors, have, a, strong, potential, for, producing, birth, defects, in, male, babies, and, this, limits, their, use, in, women, however, 5, reductase, inhibitors, are, frequently, used, to, treat, excessive, facial, body, hair, in, women, and, can, be, combined, with, birth, control, pills, to, prevent, pregnancy, there, is, no, evidence, as, of, 2010, to, support, the, use, of, cimetidine, or, ketoconazole, in, the, treatment, of, acne, hormonal, treatments, for, acne, such, as, combined, birth, control, pills, and, antiandrogens, may, be, considered, first, line, therapy, for, acne, under, many, circumstances, including,

and, erythromycin, 2, azelaic, acid, is, an, effective, acne, treatment, due, to, its, ability, to, reduce, skin, cell, accumulation, in, the, follicle, and, its, antibacterial, and, anti, inflammatory, properties, it, has, a, slight, skin, lightening, effect, due, to, its, ability, to, inhibit, melanin, synthesis, therefore, it, is, useful, in, treating, individuals, with, acne, who, are, also, affected, by, post, inflammatory, hyperpigmentation, azelaic, acid, may, cause, skin, irritation, it, is, less, effective, and, more, expensive, than, retinoids, azelaic, acid, also, led, to, worse, treatment, response, when, compared, to, benzoyl, peroxide, when, compared, to, tretinoin, azelaic, acid, makes, little, or, no, treatment, response, salicylic, acid, is, a, topically,

the, amino, acid, tyrosine, to, the, skin, pigment, melanin, and, is, used, to, treat, acne, associated, post, inflammatory, hyperpigmentation, by, interfering, with, the, production, of, melanin, in, the, epidermis, hydroquinone, leads, to, less, hyperpigmentation, as, darkened, skin, cells, are, naturally, shed, over, time, improvement, in, skin, hyperpigmentation, is, typically, seen, within, six, months, when, used, twice, daily, hydroquinone, is, ineffective, for, hyperpigmentation, affecting, deeper, layers, of, skin, such, as, the, dermis, the, use, of, a, sunscreen, with, spf, 15, or, higher, in, the, morning, with, reapplication, every, two, hours, is, recommended, when, using, hydroquinone, its, application, only, to, affected, areas, lowers, the, risk, of, lightening, the, color, of, normal, skin, but, can, lead, to, a, temporary, ring, of, lightened, skin, around, the, hyperpigmented, area, hydroquinone, is, generally, well, tolerated, side, effects, are, typically, mild, e, g, skin, irritation, and, occur, with, the, use, of, a, higher, than, the, recommended, 4, concentration, most, preparations, contain, the, preservative, sodium, metabisulfite, which, has, been, linked, to, rare, cases, of, allergic, reactions, including, anaphylaxis, and, severe, asthma, exacerbations, in, susceptible, people, in, extremely, rare, cases, the, frequent, and, improper, application, of, high, dose, hydroquinone, has, been, associated, with, a, systemic, condition, known, as, exogenous, ochronosis, skin, discoloration, and, connective, tissue, damage, from, the, accumulation, of, homogentisic, acid, combination, therapy, using, medications, of, different, classes, together, each, with, a, different, mechanism, of, action, has, been, demonstrated, to, be, a, more, effective, approach, to, acne, treatment, than, monotherapy, the, use, of, topical, benzoyl, peroxide, and, antibiotics, together, is, more, effective, than, antibiotics, alone, similarly,

adapalene, category, c, are, very, poorly, absorbed, but, certain, studies, have, suggested, teratogenic, effects, in, the, first, trimester, the, data, examining, the, association, between, maternal, topical, retinoid, exposure, in, the, first, trimester, of, pregnancy, and, adverse, pregnancy, outcomes, is, limited, a, systematic, review, of, observational, studies, concluded, that, such, exposure, does, not, appear, to, increase, the, risk, of, major, birth, defects, miscarriages, stillbirths, premature, births, or, low, birth, weight, similarly, in, studies, examining, the, effects, of, topical, retinoids, during, pregnancy, fetal, harm, has, not, been, seen, in, the, second, and, third, trimesters, nevertheless, since, rare, harms, from, topical, retinoids, are, not, ruled, out, they, are, not, recommended, for, use, during, pregnancy, due, to, persistent, safety, concerns, retinoids, contraindicated, for, use, during, pregnancy, include, the, topical, retinoid, tazarotene,

for, immediate, relief, is, the, injection, of, a, corticosteroid, into, an, inflamed, acne, comedo, electrocautery, and, electrofulguration, are, effective, alternative, treatments, for, comedones, light, therapy, is, a, treatment, method, that, involves, delivering, certain, specific, wavelengths, of, light, to, an, area, of, skin, affected, by, acne, both, regular, and, laser, light, have, been, used, the, evidence, for, light, therapy, as, a, treatment, for, acne, is, weak, and, inconclusive, various, light, therapies, appear, to, provide, a, short, term, benefit, but, data, for, long, term, outcomes, and, outcomes, in, those, with, severe, acne, are, sparse, it, may, have, a, role, for, individuals, whose, acne, has, been, resistant, to, topical, medications, a, 2016, meta, analysis, was, unable, to, conclude, whether, light, therapies, were, more, beneficial, than, placebo, or, no, treatment, nor, the, duration, of, benefit, when, regular, light, is, used, immediately, following, the, application, of, a, sensitizing, substance, to, the, skin, such, as, aminolevulinic, acid, or, methyl, aminolevulinate, the, treatment, is, referred, to, as, photodynamic, therapy, pdt, pdt, has, the, most, supporting, evidence, of, all, light, therapy, modalities, pdt, treats, acne, by, using, various, forms, of, light, e, g, blue, light, or, red, light, that, preferentially, target, the, pilosebaceous, unit, once, the, light, activates, the, sensitizing, substance, this, generates, free, radicals, and, reactive, oxygen, species, in, the, skin, which, purposefully, damage, the, sebaceous, glands, and, kill, c, acnes, bacteria, many, different, types, of, nonablative, lasers, i, e, lasers, that, do, not, vaporize, the, top, layer, of, the, skin, but, rather, induce, a, physiologic, response, in, the, skin, from, the, light, have, been, used, to, treat, acne, including, those, that, use, infrared, wavelengths, of, light, ablative, lasers, such, as, co, 2, and, fractional, types, have, also, been, used, to, treat, active, acne, and, its, scars, when, ablative, lasers, are, used, the, treatment, is, often, referred, to, as, laser, resurfacing, because, as, mentioned, previously, the, entire, upper, layers, of, the, skin, are, vaporized, ablative, lasers, are, associated, with, higher, rates, of, adverse, effects, compared, with, non, ablative, lasers, with, examples, being, post, inflammatory, hyperpigmentation, persistent, facial, redness, and, persistent, pain, physiologically, certain, wavelengths, of, light, used, with, or, without, accompanying, topical, chemicals, are, thought, to, kill, bacteria, and, decrease, the, size, and, activity, of, the, glands, that, produce, sebum, disadvantages, of, light, therapy, can, include, its, cost, the, need, for, multiple, visits, the, time, required, to, complete, the, procedure, s, and, pain, associated, with, some, of, the, treatment, modalities, typical, side, effects, include, skin, peeling, temporary, reddening, of, the, skin, swelling, and, post, inflammatory, hyperpigmentation, dermabrasion, is, an, effective, therapeutic, procedure, for, reducing, the, appearance, of, superficial, atrophic, scars, of, the, boxcar, and, rolling, varieties, ice, pick, scars, do, not, respond, well, to, treatment, with, dermabrasion, due, to, their, depth, the, procedure, is, painful, and, has, many, potential, side, effects, such, as, skin, sensitivity, to, sunlight, redness, and, decreased, pigmentation, of, the, skin, dermabrasion, has, fallen, out, of, favor, with, the, introduction, of, laser, resurfacing, unlike, dermabrasion, there, is, no, evidence, that, microdermabrasion, is, an, effective, treatment, for, acne, dermal, or, subcutaneous, fillers, are, substances, injected, into, the, skin, to, improve, the, appearance, of, acne, scars, fillers, are, used, to, increase, natural, collagen, production, in, the, skin, and, to, increase, skin, volume, and, decrease, the, depth, of, acne, scars, examples, of, fillers, used, for, this, purpose, include, hyaluronic, acid, poly, methyl, methacrylate, microspheres, with, collagen, human, and, bovine, collagen, derivatives, and, fat, harvested, from, the, person, s, own, body, autologous, fat, transfer, microneedling, is, a, procedure, in, which, an, instrument, with, multiple, rows, of, tiny, needles, is, rolled, over, the, skin, to, elicit, a, wound, healing, response, and, stimulate, collagen, production, to, reduce, the, appearance, of, atrophic, acne, scars, in, people, with, darker, skin, color, notable, adverse, effects, of, microneedling, include, post, inflammatory, hyperpigmentation, and, tram, track, scarring, described, as, discrete, slightly, raised, scars, in, a, linear, distribution, similar, to, a, tram, track, the, latter, is, thought, to, be, primarily, attributable, to, improper, technique, by, the, practitioner, including, the, use, of, excessive, pressure, or, inappropriately, large, needles, subcision, is, useful, for, the, treatment, of, superficial, atrophic, acne, scars, and, involves, the, use, of, a, small, needle, to, loosen, the, fibrotic, adhesions, that, result, in, the, depressed, appearance, of, the, scar, chemical, peels, can, be, used, to, reduce, the, appearance, of, acne, scars, mild, peels, include, those, using, glycolic, acid, lactic, acid, salicylic, acid, jessner, s, solution, or, a, lower, concentration, 20, of, trichloroacetic, acid, these, peels, only, affect, the, epidermal, layer, of, the, skin, and, can, be, useful, in, the, treatment, of, superficial, acne, scars, as, well, as, skin, pigmentation, changes, from, inflammatory, acne, higher, concentrations, of, trichloroacetic, acid, 30, 40, are, considered, to, be, medium, strength, peels, and, affect, the, skin, as, deep, as, the, papillary, dermis, formulations, of, trichloroacetic, acid, concentrated, to, 50, or, more, are, considered, to, be, deep, chemical, peels, medium, strength, and, deep, strength, chemical, peels, are, more, effective, for, deeper, atrophic, scars, but, are, more, likely, to, cause, side, effects, such, as, skin, pigmentation, changes, infection, and, small, white, superficial, cysts, known, as, milia, researchers, are, investigating, complementary, therapies, as, treatment, for, people, with, acne, low, quality, evidence, suggests, topical, application, of, tea, tree, oil, or, bee, venom, may, reduce, the, total, number, of, skin, lesions, in, those, with, acne, tea, tree, oil, appears, to, be, approximately, as, effective, as, benzoyl, peroxide, or, salicylic, acid, but, is, associated, with, allergic, contact, dermatitis, proposed, mechanisms, for, tea, tree, oil, s, anti, acne, effects, include, antibacterial, action, against, c, acnes, and, anti, inflammatory, properties, numerous, other, plant, derived, therapies, have, demonstrated, positive, effects, against, acne, e, g, basil, oil, oligosaccharides, from, seaweed, however, few, well, done, studies, have, examined, their, use, for, this, purpose, there, is, a, lack, of, high, quality, evidence, for, the, use, of, acupuncture, herbal, medicine, or, cupping, therapy, for, acne, many, over, the, counter, treatments, in, many, forms, are, available, which, are, often, known, as, cosmeceuticals, certain, types, of, makeup, may, be, useful, to, mask, acne, in, those, with, oily, skin, a, water, based, product, is, often, preferred, acne, usually, improves, around, the, age, of, 20, but, may, persist, into, adulthood, permanent, physical, scarring, may, occur, rare, complications, from, acne, or, its, treatment, include, the, formation, of, pyogenic, granulomas, osteoma, cutis, and, acne, with, facial, edema, early, and, aggressive, treatment, of, acne, is, advocated, by, some, in, the, medical, community, to, reduce, the, chances, of, these, poor, outcomes, there, is, good, evidence, to, support, the, idea, that, acne, and, associated, scarring, negatively, affect, a, person, s, psychological, state, worsen, mood, lower, self, esteem, and, are, associated, with, a, higher, risk, of, anxiety, disorders, depression, and, suicidal, thoughts, misperceptions, about, acne, s, causative, and, aggravating, factors, are, common, and, people, with, acne, often, blame, themselves, and, others, often, blame, those, with, acne, for, their, condition, such, blame, can, worsen, the, affected, person, s, sense, of, self, esteem, until, the, 20th, century, even, among, dermatologists, the, list, of, causes, was, believed, to, include, excessive, sexual, thoughts, and, masturbation, dermatology, s, association, with, sexually, transmitted, infections, especially, syphilis, contributed, to, the, stigma, another, psychological, complication, of, acne, vulgaris, is, acne, excori, e, which, occurs, when, a, person, persistently, picks, and, scratches, pimples, irrespective, of, the, severity, of, their, acne, this, can, lead, to, significant, scarring, changes, in, the, affected, person, s, skin, pigmentation, and, a, cyclic, worsening, of, the, affected, person, s, anxiety, about, their, appearance, globally, acne, affects, approximately, 650, million, people, or, about, 9, 4, of, the, population, as, of, 2010, it, affects, nearly, 90, of, people, in, western, societies, during, their, teenage, years, but, can, occur, before, adolescence, and, may, persist, into, adulthood, while, acne, that, first, develops, between, the, ages, of, 21, and, 25, is, uncommon, it, affects, 54, of, women, and, 40, of, men, older, than, 25, years, of, age, and, has, a, lifetime, prevalence, of, 85, about, 20, of, those, affected, have, moderate, or, severe, cases, it, is, slightly, more, common, in, females, than, males, 9, 8, versus, 9, 0, in, those, over, 40, years, old, 1, of, males, and, 5, of, females, still, have, problems, rates, appear, to, be, lower, in, rural, societies, while, some, research, has, found, it, affects, people, of, all, ethnic, groups, acne, may, not, occur, in, the, non, westernized, peoples, of, papua, new, guinea, and, paraguay, acne, affects, 40, 50, million, people, in, the, united, states, 16, and, approximately, 3, 5, million, in, australia, 23, severe, acne, tends, to, be, more, common, in, people, of, caucasian, or, amerindian, descent, than, in, people, of, african, descent, historical, records, indicate, pharaohs, had, acne, which, may, be, the, earliest, known, reference, to, the, disease, sulfur, s, usefulness, as, a, topical, remedy, for, acne, dates, back, to, at, least, the, reign, of, cleopatra, 69, 30, bce, the, sixth, century, greek, physician, a, tius, of, amida, reportedly, coined, the, term, ionthos, or, acnae, which, seems, to, be, a, reference, to, facial, skin, lesions, that, occur, during, the, acme, of, life, puberty, in, the, 16th, century, the, french, physician, and, botanist, fran, ois, boissier, de, sauvages, de, lacroix, provided, one, of, the, earlier, descriptions, of, acne, he, used, the, term, psydracia, achne, to, describe, small, red, and, hard, tubercles, that, altered, a, person, s, facial, appearance, during, adolescence, and, were, neither, itchy, nor, painful, the, recognition, and, characterization, of, acne, progressed, in, 1776, when, josef, plenck, an, austrian, physician, published, a, book, that, proposed, the, novel, concept, of, classifying, skin, diseases, by, their, elementary, initial, lesions, in, 1808, the, english, dermatologist, robert, willan, refined, plenck, s, work, by, providing, the, first, detailed, descriptions, of, several, skin, disorders, using, morphologic, terminology, that, remains, in, use, today, thomas, bateman, continued, and, expanded, on, robert, willan, s, work, as, his, student, and, provided, the, first, descriptions, and, illustrations, of, acne, accepted, as, accurate, by, modern, dermatologists, erasmus, wilson, in, 1842, was, the, first, to, make, the, distinction, between, acne, vulgaris, and, rosacea, the, first, professional, medical, monograph, dedicated, entirely, to, acne, was, written, by, lucius, duncan, bulkley, and, published, in, new, york, in, 1885, scientists, initially, hypothesized, that, acne, represented, a, disease, of, the, skin, s, hair, follicle, and, occurred, due, to, blockage, of, the, pore, by, sebum, during, the, 1880s, they, observed, bacteria, by, microscopy, in, skin, samples, from, people, with, acne, investigators, believed, the, bacteria, caused, comedones, sebum, production, and, ultimately, acne, during, the, mid, twentieth, century, dermatologists, realized, that, no, single, hypothesized, factor, sebum, bacteria, or, excess, keratin, fully, accounted, for, the, disease, in, its, entirety, this, led, to, the, current, understanding, that, acne, could, be, explained, by, a, sequence, of, related, events, beginning, with, blockage, of, the, skin, follicle, by, excessive, dead, skin, cells, followed, by, bacterial, invasion, of, the, hair, follicle, pore, changes, in, sebum, production, and, inflammation, the, approach, to, acne, treatment, underwent, significant, changes, during, the, twentieth, century, retinoids, became, a, medical, treatment, for, acne, in, 1943, benzoyl, peroxide, was, first, proposed, as, a, treatment, in, 1958, and, remains, a, staple, of, acne, treatment, the, introduction, of, oral, tetracycline, antibiotics, such, as, minocycline, modified, acne, treatment, in, the, 1950s, these, reinforced, the, idea, amongst, dermatologists, that, bacterial, growth, on, the, skin, plays, an, important, role, in, causing, acne, subsequently, in, the, 1970s, tretinoin, original, trade, name, retin, a, was, found, to, be, an, effective, treatment, the, development, of, oral, isotretinoin, sold, as, accutane, and, roaccutane, followed, in, 1980, after, its, introduction, in, the, united, states, scientists, identified, isotretinoin, as, a, medication, highly, likely, to, cause, birth, defects, if, taken, during, pregnancy, in, the, united, states, more, than, 2, 000, women, became, pregnant, while, taking, isotretinoin, between, 1982, and, 2003, with, most, pregnancies, ending, in, abortion, or, miscarriage, approximately, 160, babies, were, born, with, birth, defects, due, to, maternal, use, of, isotretinoin, during, pregnancy, treatment, of, acne, with, topical, crushed, dry, ice, known, as, cryoslush, was, first, described, in, 1907, but, is, no, longer, performed, commonly, before, 1960, the, use, of, x, rays, was, also, a, common, treatment, the, costs, and, social, impact, of, acne, are, substantial, in, the, united, states, acne, vulgaris, is, responsible, for, more, than, 5, million, doctor, visits, and, costs, over, us, 2, 5, billion, each, year, in, direct, costs, similarly, acne, vulgaris, is, responsible, for, 3, 5, million, doctor, visits, each, year, in, the, united, kingdom, sales, for, the, top, ten, leading, acne, treatment, brands, in, the, us, in, 2015, amounted, to, 352, million, acne, vulgaris, and, its, resultant, scars, are, associated, with, significant, social, and, academic, difficulties, that, can, last, into, adulthood, during, the, great, depression, dermatologists, discovered, that, young, men, with, acne, had, difficulty, obtaining, jobs, until, the, 1930s, many, people, viewed, acne, as, a, trivial, problem, among, middle, class, girls, because, unlike, smallpox, and, tuberculosis, no, one, died, from, it, and, a, feminine, problem, because, boys, were, much, less, likely, to, seek, medical, assistance, for, it, during, world, war, ii, some, soldiers, in, tropical, climates, developed, such, severe, and, widespread, tropical, acne, on, their, bodies, that, they, were, declared, medically, unfit, for, duty, efforts, to, better, understand, the, mechanisms, of, sebum, production, are, underway, this, research, aims, to, develop, medications, that, target, and, interfere, with, the, hormones, that, are, known, to, increase, sebum, production, e, g, igf, 1, and, alpha, melanocyte, stimulating, hormone, other, sebum, lowering, medications, such, as, topical, antiandrogens, peroxisome, proliferator, activated, receptor, modulators, and, inhibitors, of, the, stearoyl, coa, desaturase, 1, enzyme, are, also, a, focus, of, research, efforts, particles, that, release, nitric, oxide, into, the, skin, to, decrease, skin, inflammation, caused, by, c, acnes, and, the, immune, system, have, shown, promise, for, improving, acne, in, early, clinical, trials, another, avenue, of, early, stage, research, has, focused, on, how, to, best, use, laser, and, light, therapy, to, selectively, destroy, sebum, producing, glands, in, the, skin, s, hair, follicles, to, reduce, sebum, production, and, improve, acne, appearance, the, use, of, antimicrobial, peptides, against, c, acnes, is, under, investigation, as, a, treatment, for, acne, to, overcoming, antibiotic, resistance, in, 2007, scientists, reported, the, first, genome, sequencing, of, a, c, acnes, bacteriophage, pa6, the, authors, proposed, applying, this, research, toward, the, development, of, bacteriophage, therapy, as, an, acne, treatment, to, overcome, the, problems, associated, with, long, term, antibiotic, use, such, as, bacterial, resistance, oral, and, topical, probiotics, are, under, evaluation, as, treatments, for, acne, probiotics, may, have, therapeutic, effects, for, those, affected, by, acne, due, to, their, ability, to, decrease, skin, inflammation, and, improve, skin, moisture, by, increasing, the, skin, s, ceramide, content, as, of, 2014, knowledge, of, the, effects, of, probiotics, on, acne, in, humans, was, limited, decreased, levels, of, retinoic, acid, in, the, skin, may, contribute, to, comedo, formation, researchers, are, investigating, methods, to, increase, the, skin, s, production, of, retinoic, acid, to, address, this, deficiency, a, vaccine, against, inflammatory, acne, has, shown, promising, results, in, mice, and, humans, some, have, voiced, concerns, about, creating, a, vaccine, designed, to, neutralize, a, stable, community, of, normal, skin, bacteria, that, is, known, to, protect, the, skin, from, colonization, by, more, harmful, microorganisms, acne, can, occur, on, cats, dogs, and, horses
