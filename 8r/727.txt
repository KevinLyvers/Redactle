vampire, bats, members, of, the, subfamily, desmodontinae, are, leaf, nosed, bats, currently, found, in, central, and, south, america, their, food, source, is, the, blood, of, other, animals, a, dietary, trait, called, hematophagy, three, extant, bat, species, feed, solely, on, blood, the, common, vampire, bat, desmodus, rotundus, the, hairy, legged, vampire, bat, diphylla, ecaudata, and, the, white, winged, vampire, bat, diaemus, youngi, two, extinct, species, of, the, genus, desmodus, have, been, found, in, north, america, due, to, differences, among, the, three, species, each, has, been, placed, within, a, different, genus, each, consisting, of, one, extant, species, in, the, older, literature, these, three, genera, were, placed, within, a, family, of, their, own, desmodontidae, but, taxonomists, have, now, grouped, them, as, a, subfamily, desmodontinae, in, the, new, world, leaf, nosed, bat, family, phyllostomidae, the, three, known, species, of, vampire, bats, all, seem, more, similar, to, one, another, than, to, any, other, species, that, suggests, that, hematophagy, evolved, only, once, and, the, three, species, share, this, common, ancestor, 163, 167, the, placement, of, the, three, genera, of, the, subfamily, desmodontinae, within, the, new, world, leaf, nosed, bat, family, phyllostomidae, gray, 1825, may, be, summarized, as, vampire, bats, are, in, a, diverse, family, of, bats, that, consume, many, food, sources, including, nectar, pollen, insects, fruit, and, meat, the, three, species, of, vampire, bats, are, the, only, mammals, that, have, evolved, to, feed, exclusively, on, blood, hematophagy, as, micropredators, a, strategy, within, parasitism, hematophagy, is, uncommon, due, to, the, number, of, challenges, to, overcome, for, success, a, large, volume, of, liquid, potentially, overwhelming, the, kidneys, and, bladder, the, risk, of, iron, poisoning, and, coping, with, excess, protein, there, are, multiple, hypotheses, for, how, vampire, bats, evolved, the, vampire, bat, lineage, diverged, from, its, family, 26, million, years, ago, the, hairy, legged, vampire, bat, likely, diverged, from, the, other, two, species, of, vampire, bats, 21, 7, million, years, ago, because, the, hairy, legged, vampire, bat, feeds, on, bird, blood, and, it, is, the, most, basal, of, living, vampire, bats, it, is, considered, likely, that, the, first, vampire, bats, fed, on, bird, blood, as, well, recent, analyses, suggest, that, vampire, bats, arose, from, insectivores, which, discount, the, frugivore, carnivore, and, nectarivore, hypotheses, of, origin, within, 4, million, years, of, diverging, from, other, phyllostomidae, vampire, bats, had, evolved, all, necessary, adaptations, for, blood, feeding, making, it, one, of, the, fastest, examples, of, natural, selection, among, mammals, unlike, fruit, bats, the, vampire, bats, have, short, conical, muzzles, they, also, lack, a, nose, leaf, instead, having, naked, pads, with, u, shaped, grooves, at, the, tip, the, common, vampire, bat, desmodus, rotundus, also, has, specialized, thermoreceptors, on, its, nose, which, aid, the, animal, in, locating, areas, where, the, blood, flows, close, to, the, skin, of, its, prey, a, nucleus, has, been, found, in, the, brain, of, vampire, bats, that, has, a, similar, position, and, similar, histology, to, the, infrared, receptor, of, infrared, sensing, snakes, a, vampire, bat, has, front, teeth, that, are, specialized, for, cutting, and, the, back, teeth, are, much, smaller, than, in, other, bats, the, inferior, colliculus, the, part, of, the, bat, s, brain, that, processes, sound, is, well, adapted, to, detecting, the, regular, breathing, sounds, of, sleeping, animals, that, serve, as, its, main, food, source, while, other, bats, have, almost, lost, the, ability, to, maneuver, on, land, vampire, bats, can, walk, jump, and, even, run, by, using, a, unique, bounding, gait, in, which, the, forelimbs, instead, of, the, hindlimbs, are, recruited, for, force, production, as, the, wings, are, much, more, powerful, than, the, legs, this, ability, to, run, seems, to, have, evolved, independently, within, the, bat, lineage, vampire, bats, also, have, a, high, level, of, resistance, to, a, group, of, bloodborne, viruses, known, as, endogenous, retroviruses, which, insert, copies, of, their, genetic, material, into, their, host, s, genome, it, was, recently, discovered, that, the, vampire, bat, s, loss, of, the, rep15, gene, allows, for, enhanced, iron, secretion, in, adaptation, to, the, high, iron, diet, vampire, bats, use, infrared, radiation, to, locate, blood, hotspots, on, their, prey, a, recent, study, has, shown, that, common, vampire, bats, tune, a, trp, channel, that, is, already, heat, sensitive, trpv1, by, lowering, its, thermal, activation, threshold, to, about, 30, c, 86, f, this, is, achieved, through, alternative, splicing, of, trpv1, transcripts, to, produce, a, channel, with, a, truncated, carboxy, terminal, cytoplasmic, domain, these, splicing, events, occur, exclusively, in, trigeminal, ganglia, and, not, in, dorsal, root, ganglia, thereby, maintaining, a, role, for, trpv1, as, a, detector, of, noxious, heat, in, somatic, afferents, the, only, other, known, vertebrates, capable, of, detecting, infrared, radiation, are, boas, pythons, and, pit, vipers, all, of, which, have, pit, organs, vampire, bats, tend, to, live, in, colonies, in, almost, completely, dark, places, such, as, caves, old, wells, hollow, trees, and, buildings, they, range, in, central, to, south, america, and, live, in, arid, to, humid, tropical, and, subtropical, areas, vampire, bat, colony, numbers, can, range, from, single, digits, to, hundreds, in, roosting, sites, the, basic, social, structure, of, roosting, bats, is, made, of, female, groups, and, their, offspring, a, few, adult, males, known, as, resident, males, and, a, separate, group, of, males, known, as, nonresident, males, in, hairy, legged, vampire, bats, the, hierarchical, segregation, of, nonresident, males, appears, less, strict, than, in, common, vampire, bats, nonresident, males, are, accepted, into, the, harems, when, the, ambient, temperature, lowers, this, behavior, suggests, social, thermoregulation, resident, males, mate, with, the, females, in, their, harems, and, it, is, less, common, for, outside, males, to, copulate, with, the, females, female, offspring, often, remain, in, their, natal, groups, several, matrilines, can, be, found, in, a, group, as, unrelated, females, regularly, join, groups, male, offspring, tend, to, live, in, their, natal, groups, until, they, are, about, two, years, old, sometimes, being, forcibly, expelled, by, the, resident, adult, males, vampire, bats, on, average, live, about, nine, years, when, they, are, in, their, natural, environment, in, the, wild, vampire, bats, form, strong, bonds, with, other, members, of, the, colony, a, related, unique, adaptation, of, vampire, bats, is, the, sharing, of, food, a, vampire, bat, can, only, survive, about, two, days, without, feeding, yet, they, cannot, be, guaranteed, of, finding, food, every, night, this, poses, a, problem, so, when, a, bat, fails, to, find, food, it, will, often, beg, another, bat, for, food, a, donor, bat, may, regurgitate, a, small, amount, of, blood, to, sustain, the, other, member, of, the, colony, for, equally, familiar, bats, the, predictive, capacity, of, reciprocity, surpasses, that, of, relatedness, this, finding, suggests, that, vampire, bats, are, capable, of, preferentially, aiding, their, relatives, but, that, they, may, benefit, more, from, forming, reciprocal, cooperative, relationships, with, relatives, and, non, relatives, alike, furthermore, donor, bats, were, more, likely, to, approach, starving, bats, and, initiate, the, food, sharing, when, individuals, of, a, population, are, lost, bats, with, a, larger, number, of, mutual, donors, tend, to, offset, their, own, energetic, costs, at, a, higher, rate, than, bats, that, fed, less, of, the, colony, before, the, removal, individuals, that, spend, their, own, energy, as, a, social, investment, of, sorts, are, more, likely, to, thrive, and, higher, rates, of, survival, incentivize, the, behavior, and, reinforce, the, importance, of, large, social, networks, in, colonies, these, findings, contradict, the, harassment, hypothesis, which, claims, that, individuals, share, food, in, order, to, limit, harassment, by, begging, individuals, all, considered, vampire, bat, research, should, be, interpreted, cautiously, as, much, of, the, evidence, is, correlational, and, still, requires, further, testing, another, ability, that, some, vampire, bats, possess, is, identifying, and, monitoring, the, positions, of, conspecifics, individuals, of, the, same, species, simply, by, antiphonal, calling, similar, in, nature, to, the, sound, mother, bats, make, to, call, to, their, pups, these, calls, tend, to, vary, on, a, bat, to, bat, basis, which, may, help, other, bats, identify, individuals, both, in, and, outside, of, their, roost, vampire, bats, also, engage, in, social, grooming, it, usually, occurs, between, females, and, their, offspring, but, it, is, also, significant, between, adult, females, social, grooming, is, mostly, associated, with, food, sharing, vampire, bats, hunt, only, when, it, is, fully, dark, like, fruit, eating, bats, and, unlike, insectivorous, and, fish, eating, bats, they, emit, only, low, energy, sound, pulses, the, common, vampire, bat, feeds, primarily, on, the, blood, of, mammals, occasionally, including, humans, whereas, both, the, hairy, legged, vampire, bat, and, white, winged, vampire, bat, feed, primarily, on, the, blood, of, birds, once, the, common, vampire, bat, locates, a, host, such, as, a, sleeping, mammal, it, lands, and, approaches, it, on, the, ground, while, on, all, fours, it, then, likely, uses, thermoception, to, identify, a, warm, spot, on, the, skin, to, bite, they, then, create, a, small, incision, with, their, teeth, and, lap, up, blood, from, the, wound, vampire, bats, like, snakes, have, developed, highly, sensitive, thermosensation, with, specialized, systems, for, detecting, infrared, radiation, snakes, co, opt, a, non, heat, sensitive, channel, vertebrate, trpa1, transient, receptor, potential, cation, channel, a1, to, produce, an, infrared, detector, however, vampire, bats, tune, a, channel, that, is, already, heat, sensitive, trpv1, by, lowering, its, thermal, activation, threshold, to, about, 30, c, 86, f, which, allows, them, to, sense, the, target, as, noted, by, arthur, m, greenhall, the, most, common, species, the, common, vampire, desmodus, is, not, fastidious, and, will, attack, any, warm, blooded, animal, the, white, winged, vampire, diaemus, appears, to, have, a, special, preference, for, birds, and, goats, in, the, laboratory, it, has, not, been, possible, to, feed, diaemus, on, cattle, blood, if, there, is, fur, on, the, skin, of, the, host, the, common, vampire, bat, uses, its, canine, and, cheek, teeth, like, a, barber, s, blades, to, shave, away, the, hairs, the, bat, s, razor, sharp, upper, incisor, teeth, then, make, a, 7, mm, wide, and, 8, mm, deep, cut, the, upper, incisors, lack, enamel, which, keeps, them, permanently, razor, sharp, their, teeth, are, so, sharp, even, handling, their, skulls, in, a, museum, can, result, in, cuts, the, bat, s, saliva, left, in, the, victim, s, resulting, bite, wound, has, a, key, function, in, feeding, from, the, wound, the, saliva, contains, several, compounds, that, prolong, bleeding, such, as, anticoagulants, that, inhibit, blood, clotting, and, compounds, that, prevent, the, constriction, of, blood, vessels, near, the, wound, a, typical, female, vampire, bat, weighs, 40, grams, 1, 4, oz, and, can, consume, over, 20, grams, 1, fluid, ounce, of, blood, in, a, 20, minute, feed, this, feeding, behavior, is, facilitated, by, its, anatomy, and, physiology, for, rapid, processing, and, digestion, of, the, blood, to, enable, the, animal, to, take, flight, soon, after, the, feeding, the, stomach, and, intestine, rapidly, absorb, the, water, in, the, blood, meal, which, is, quickly, transported, to, the, kidneys, and, on, to, the, bladder, for, excretion, a, common, vampire, bat, begins, to, expel, urine, within, two, minutes, of, feeding, while, shedding, much, of, the, blood, s, liquid, facilitates, flight, takeoff, the, bat, still, has, added, almost, 20, 30, of, its, body, weight, in, blood, to, take, off, from, the, ground, the, bat, generates, extra, lift, by, crouching, and, flinging, itself, into, the, air, typically, within, two, hours, of, setting, out, in, search, of, food, the, common, vampire, bat, returns, to, its, roost, and, settles, down, to, spend, the, rest, of, the, night, digesting, its, meal, digestion, is, aided, by, their, microbiome, and, their, genome, protects, them, against, pathogens, in, the, blood, its, stool, is, roughly, the, same, as, that, from, bats, eating, fruits, or, insects, rabies, can, be, transmitted, to, humans, and, other, animals, by, vampire, bat, bites, since, dogs, are, now, widely, immunized, against, rabies, the, number, of, human, rabies, transmissions, by, vampire, bats, exceeds, those, by, dogs, in, latin, america, with, 55, documented, cases, in, 2005, the, risk, of, infection, to, the, human, population, is, less, than, to, livestock, exposed, to, bat, bites, various, estimates, of, the, prevalence, of, rabies, in, bat, populations, have, been, made, it, has, been, estimated, that, less, than, 1, of, wild, bats, in, regions, where, rabies, is, endemic, are, infected, with, the, virus, at, any, given, time, bats, that, are, infected, may, be, clumsy, disoriented, and, unable, to, fly, the, unique, properties, of, vampire, bat, saliva, have, found, some, positive, use, in, medicine, various, studies, published, in, stroke, journal, of, the, american, heart, association, on, a, genetically, engineered, drug, called, desmoteplase, which, uses, the, anticoagulant, properties, of, the, saliva, of, desmodus, rotundus, found, that, it, increased, blood, flow, in, stroke, patients
