bustards, including, floricans, and, korhaans, are, large, terrestrial, birds, living, mainly, in, dry, grassland, areas, and, in, steppe, regions, they, range, in, length, from, 40, to, 150, cm, 16, to, 59, in, they, make, up, the, family, otididae, o, t, d, d, i, formerly, known, as, otidae, bustards, are, omnivorous, and, opportunistic, eating, leaves, buds, seeds, fruit, small, vertebrates, and, invertebrates, there, are, 26, species, currently, recognised, the, word, bustard, comes, from, the, old, french, bistarda, and, some, other, languages, abetarda, pt, abetarda, gl, avutarda, es, used, for, the, great, bustard, the, naturalist, william, turner, listed, the, english, spelling, bustard, and, bistard, in, 1544, all, of, the, common, names, above, are, derived, from, latin, avis, tarda, or, aves, tardas, given, by, pliny, the, elder, these, names, were, mentioned, by, the, pierre, belon, in, 1555, and, ulisse, aldrovandi, in, 1600, the, word, tarda, comes, from, tardus, in, latin, meaning, slow, and, deliberate, which, is, apt, to, describe, the, typical, walking, style, of, the, species, some, indian, bustards, are, also, called, floricans, the, origin, of, the, name, is, unclear, thomas, c, jerdon, writes, in, the, birds, of, india, 1862, i, have, not, been, able, to, trace, the, origin, of, the, anglo, indian, word, florikin, but, was, once, informed, that, the, little, bustard, in, europe, was, sometimes, called, flanderkin, latham, gives, the, word, flercher, as, an, english, name, and, this, apparently, has, the, same, origin, as, florikin, the, hobson, jobson, dictionary, however, casts, doubt, on, this, theory, stating, that, we, doubt, if, jerdon, has, here, understood, latham, correctly, what, latham, writes, is, in, describing, the, passarage, bustard, which, he, says, is, the, size, of, the, little, bustard, inhabits, india, called, passarage, plover, i, find, that, it, is, known, in, india, by, the, name, of, oorail, by, some, of, the,

a, weight, of, 20, kg, 44, lb, weigh, around, 13, 5, kg, 30, lb, on, average, and, can, attain, a, total, length, of, 150, cm, 59, in, the, smallest, species, is, the, little, brown, bustard,

longer, and, sometimes, more, than, twice, the, weight, they, are, among, the, most, sexually, dimorphic, groups, of, birds, in, only, the, floricans, is, the, sexual, dimorphism, the, reverse, with, the, adult, female, being, slightly, larger, and, heavier, than, the, male, the, wings, have, 10, primaries, and, 16, 24, secondary, feathers, there, are, 18, 20, feathers, in, the, tail, the, plumage, is, predominantly, cryptic, bustards, are, omnivorous, feeding, principally, on, seeds, and, invertebrates, they, make, their, nests, on, the, ground, making, their, eggs, and, offspring, often, very, vulnerable, to, predation, they, walk, steadily, on, strong, legs, and, big, toes, pecking, for, food, as, they, go, most, prefer, to, run, or, walk, over, flying, they, have, long, broad, wings, with, fingered, wingtips, and, striking, patterns, in, flight, many, have, interesting, mating, displays, such, as, inflating, throat, sacs, or, elevating, elaborate, feathered, crests, the, female, lays, three, to, five, dark, speckled, eggs, in, a, scrape, in, the, ground, and, incubates, them, alone, genetic, dating, indicates, that, bustards, evolved, c, 30, million, years, ago, in, either, southern, or, eastern, africa, from, where, they, dispersed, into, eurasia, and, australia, bustards, are, gregarious, outside, the, breeding, season, but, are, very, wary, and, difficult, to, approach, in, the, open, habitats, they, prefer, most, species, are, declining, or, endangered, through, habitat, loss, and, hunting, even, where, they, are, nominally, protected, the, birds, were, once, common, and, abounded, on, the, salisbury, plain, they, had, become, rare, by, 1819, when, a, large, male, surprised, by, a, dog, on, newmarket, heath, sold, in, leadenhall, market, for, five, guineas, the, last, bustard, in, britain, died, in, approximately, 1832, but, the, bird, is, being, reintroduced, through, batches, of, chicks, imported, from, russia, in, 2009, two, great, bustard, chicks, were, hatched, in, britain, for, the, first, time, in, more, than, 170, years, reintroduced, bustards, also, hatched, chicks, in, 2010
