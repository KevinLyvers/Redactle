attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, is, a, neurodevelopmental, disorder, characterised, by, executive, dysfunction, occasioning, symptoms, of, inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and, emotional, dysregulation, that, are, excessive, and, pervasive, impairing, in, multiple, contexts, and, developmentally, inappropriate, adhd, symptoms, arise, from, executive, dysfunction, and, emotional, dysregulation, is, often, considered, a, core, symptom, difficulties, in, self, regulation, such, as, time, management, inhibition, and, sustained, attention, may, cause, poor, professional, performance, relationship, difficulties, and, numerous, health, risks, collectively, predisposing, to, a, diminished, quality, of, life, and, a, direct, average, reduction, in, life, expectancy, of, 13, years, adhd, is, associated, with, other, neurodevelopmental, and, mental, disorders, as, well, as, non, psychiatric, disorders, which, can, cause, additional, impairment, although, people, with, adhd, struggle, to, persist, on, tasks, with, delayed, consequences, they, may, be, able, to, do, so, on, tasks, they, find, intrinsically, interesting, or, immediately, rewarding, this, is, known, as, hyperfocus, more, colloquially, or, perseverative, responding, this, mental, state, is, often, hard, to, disengage, from, and, can, be, related, to, risks, such, as, for, internet, addiction, and, types, of, offending, behaviour, adhd, represents, the, extreme, lower, end, of, the, continuous, dimensional, trait, bell, curve, of, executive, functioning, and, self, regulation, which, is, supported, by, twin, brain, imaging, and, molecular, genetic, studies, the, precise, causes, of, adhd, are, unknown, in, the, majority, of, cases, for, most, people, with, adhd, many, genetic, and, environmental, risk, factors, accumulate, to, cause, the, disorder, the, environmental, risks, are, biological, and, most, often, exert, their, effects, in, the, prenatal, period, however, in, rare, cases, adhd, may, be, caused, by, a, single, event, such, as, traumatic, brain, injury, exposure, to, biohazards, during, pregnancy, a, major, genetic, mutation, or, extreme, environmental, deprivation, very, early, in, life, there, is, no, biologically, distinct, adult, onset, adhd, except, for, when, adhd, occurs, after, traumatic, brain, injury, inattention, hyperactivity, restlessness, in, adults, disruptive, behaviour, and, impulsivity, are, common, in, adhd, academic, difficulties, are, frequent, as, are, problems, with, relationships, the, signs, and, symptoms, can, be, difficult, to, define, as, it, is, hard, to, draw, a, line, at, where, normal, levels, of, inattention, hyperactivity, and, impulsivity, end, and, significant, levels, requiring, interventions, begin, according, to, the, fifth, edition, of, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, 5, and, its, text, revision, dsm, 5, tr, symptoms, must, be, present, for, six, months, or, more, to, a, degree, that, is, much, greater, than, others, of, the, same, age, this, requires, at, least, six, symptoms, of, either, inattention, or, hyperactivity, impulsivity, for, those, under, 17, and, at, least, five, symptoms, for, those, 17, years, or, older, the, symptoms, must, be, present, in, at, least, two, settings, e, g, social, school, work, or, home, and, must, directly, interfere, with, or, reduce, quality, of, functioning, additionally, several, symptoms, must, have, been, present, before, age, twelve, the, dsm, 5, s, required, age, of, onset, of, symptoms, is, 12, years, however, research, indicates, the, age, of, onset, should, not, be, interpreted, as, a, prerequisite, for, diagnosis, given, contextual, exceptions, adhd, is, divided, into, three, primary, presentations, the, table, symptoms, lists, the, symptoms, for, adhd, i, and, adhd, hi, from, two, major, classification, systems, symptoms, which, can, be, better, explained, by, another, psychiatric, or, medical, condition, which, an, individual, has, are, not, considered, to, be, a, symptom, of, adhd, for, that, person, in, dsm, 5, subtypes, were, discarded, and, reclassified, as, presentations, of, the, disorder, that, change, over, time, the, individual, may, also, meet, the, criteria, for, hyperactivity, impulsivity, but, the, inattentive, symptoms, are, predominant, the, individual, may, also, meet, the, criteria, for, inattention, but, the, hyperactive, impulsive, symptoms, are, predominant, girls, and, women, with, adhd, tend, to, display, fewer, hyperactivity, and, impulsivity, symptoms, but, more, symptoms, of, inattention, and, distractibility, symptoms, are, expressed, differently, and, more, subtly, as, the, individual, ages, 6, hyperactivity, tends, to, become, less, overt, with, age, and, turns, into, inner, restlessness, difficulty, relaxing, or, remaining, still, talkativeness, or, constant, mental, activity, in, teens, and, adults, with, adhd, 6, 7, impulsivity, in, adulthood, may, appear, as, thoughtless, behaviour, impatience, irresponsible, spending, and, sensation, seeking, behaviours, 6, while, inattention, may, appear, as, becoming, easily, bored, difficulty, with, organization, remaining, on, task, and, making, decisions, and, sensitivity, to, stress, 6, although, not, listed, as, an, official, symptom, emotional, dysregulation, or, mood, lability, is, generally, understood, to, be, a, common, symptom, of, adhd, 6, people, with, adhd, of, all, ages, are, more, likely, to, have, problems, with, social, skills, such, as, social, interaction, and, forming, and, maintaining, friendships, this, is, true, for, all, presentations, about, half, of, children, and, adolescents, with, adhd, experience, social, rejection, by, their, peers, compared, to, 10, 15, of, non, adhd, children, and, adolescents, people, with, attention, deficits, are, prone, to, having, difficulty, processing, verbal, and, nonverbal, language, which, can, negatively, affect, social, interaction, they, may, also, drift, off, during, conversations, miss, social, cues, and, have, trouble, learning, social, skills, difficulties, managing, anger, are, more, common, in, children, with, adhd, as, are, delays, in, speech, language, and, motor, development, poorer, handwriting, is, more, common, in, children, with, adhd, poor, handwriting, can, be, a, symptom, of, adhd, in, itself, due, to, decreased, attentiveness, when, this, is, a, pervasive, problem, it, may, also, be, attributable, to, dyslexia, or, dysgraphia, there, is, significant, overlap, in, the, symptomatologies, of, adhd, dyslexia, and, dysgraphia, and, 3, in, 10, people, diagnosed, with, dyslexia, experience, co, occurring, adhd, although, it, causes, significant, difficulty, many, children, with, adhd, have, an, attention, span, equal, to, or, greater, than, that, of, other, children, for, tasks, and, subjects, they, find, interesting, certain, studies, have, found, that, people, with, adhd, tend, to, have, lower, scores, on, intelligence, quotient, iq, tests, the, significance, of, this, is, controversial, due, to, the, differences, between, people, with, adhd, and, the, difficulty, determining, the, influence, of, symptoms, such, as, distractibility, on, lower, scores, rather, than, intellectual, capacity, in, studies, of, adhd, higher, iqs, may, be, over, represented, because, many, studies, exclude, individuals, who, have, lower, iqs, despite, those, with, adhd, scoring, on, average, nine, points, lower, on, standardised, intelligence, measures, however, other, studies, contradict, this, saying, that, in, individuals, with, high, intelligence, there, is, an, increased, risk, of, a, missed, adhd, diagnosis, possibly, because, of, compensatory, strategies, in, said, individuals, studies, of, adults, suggest, that, negative, differences, in, intelligence, are, not, meaningful, and, may, be, explained, by, associated, health, problems, in, children, adhd, occurs, with, other, disorders, about, two, thirds, of, the, time, other, neurodevelopmental, conditions, are, common, comorbidities, autism, spectrum, disorder, asd, co, occurring, at, a, rate, of, 21, in, those, with, adhd, affects, social, skills, ability, to, communicate, behaviour, and, interests, learning, disabilities, have, been, found, to, occur, in, about, 20, 30, of, children, with, adhd, learning, disabilities, can, include, developmental, speech, and, language, disorders, and, academic, skills, disorders, adhd, however, is, not, considered, a, learning, disability, but, it, very, frequently, causes, academic, difficulties, intellectual, disabilities, 75, and, tourette, s, syndrome, are, also, common, adhd, is, often, comorbid, with, disruptive, impulse, control, and, conduct, disorders, oppositional, defiant, disorder, odd, occurs, in, about, 25, of, children, with, an, inattentive, presentation, and, 50, of, those, with, a, combined, presentation, it, is, characterised, by, angry, or, irritable, mood, argumentative, or, defiant, behaviour, and, vindictiveness, which, are, age, inappropriate, conduct, disorder, cd, occurs, in, about, 25, of, adolescents, with, adhd, it, is, characterised, by, aggression, destruction, of, property, deceitfulness, theft, and, violations, of, rules, adolescents, with, adhd, who, also, have, cd, are, more, likely, to, develop, antisocial, personality, disorder, in, adulthood, brain, imaging, supports, that, cd, and, adhd, are, separate, conditions, conduct, disorder, was, shown, to, reduce, the, size, of, one, s, temporal, lobe, and, limbic, system, and, increase, the, size, of, one, s, orbitofrontal, cortex, whereas, adhd, was, shown, to, reduce, connections, in, the, cerebellum, and, prefrontal, cortex, more, broadly, conduct, disorder, involves, more, impairment, in, motivation, control, than, adhd, intermittent, explosive, disorder, is, characterised, by, sudden, and, disproportionate, outbursts, of, anger, and, co, occurs, in, individuals, with, adhd, more, frequently, than, in, the, general, population, anxiety, and, mood, disorders, are, frequent, comorbidities, anxiety, disorders, have, been, found, to, occur, more, commonly, in, the, adhd, population, as, have, mood, disorders, especially, bipolar, disorder, and, major, depressive, disorder, boys, diagnosed, with, the, combined, adhd, subtype, are, more, likely, to, have, a, mood, disorder, adults, and, children, with, adhd, sometimes, also, have, bipolar, disorder, which, requires, careful, assessment, to, accurately, diagnose, and, treat, both, conditions, sleep, disorders, and, adhd, commonly, co, exist, they, can, also, occur, as, a, side, effect, of, medications, used, to, treat, adhd, in, children, with, adhd, insomnia, is, the, most, common, sleep, disorder, with, behavioural, therapy, being, the, preferred, treatment, problems, with, sleep, initiation, are, common, among, individuals, with, adhd, but, often, they, will, be, deep, sleepers, and, have, significant, difficulty, getting, up, in, the, morning, melatonin, is, sometimes, used, in, children, who, have, sleep, onset, insomnia, restless, legs, syndrome, has, been, found, to, be, more, common, in, those, with, adhd, and, is, often, due, to, iron, deficiency, anemia, however, restless, legs, can, simply, be, a, part, of, adhd, and, requires, careful, assessment, to, differentiate, between, the, two, disorders, delayed, sleep, phase, disorder, is, also, a, common, comorbidity, individuals, with, adhd, are, at, increased, risk, of, substance, use, disorders, 9, this, is, most, commonly, seen, with, alcohol, or, cannabis, 9, the, reason, for, this, may, be, an, altered, reward, pathway, in, the, brains, of, adhd, individuals, self, treatment, and, increased, psychosocial, risk, factors, 9, this, makes, the, evaluation, and, treatment, of, adhd, more, difficult, with, serious, substance, misuse, problems, usually, treated, first, due, to, their, greater, risks, other, psychiatric, conditions, include, reactive, attachment, disorder, characterised, by, a, severe, inability, to, appropriately, relate, socially, and, cognitive, disengagement, syndrome, a, distinct, attention, disorder, occurring, in, 30, 50, of, adhd, cases, as, a, comorbidity, regardless, of, the, presentation, a, subset, of, cases, diagnosed, with, adhd, pip, have, been, found, to, have, cds, instead, individuals, with, adhd, are, three, times, more, likely, to, be, diagnosed, with, an, eating, disorder, compared, to, those, without, adhd, conversely, individuals, with, eating, disorders, are, two, times, more, likely, to, have, adhd, than, those, without, eating, disorders, adhd, trauma, and, adverse, childhood, experiences, are, also, comorbid, which, could, in, part, be, potentially, explained, by, the, similarity, in, presentation, between, different, diagnoses, the, symptoms, of, adhd, and, ptsd, can, have, significant, behavioural, overlap, in, particular, motor, restlessness, difficulty, concentrating, distractibility, irritability, anger, emotional, constriction, or, dysregulation, poor, impulse, control, and, forgetfulness, are, common, in, both, this, could, result, in, trauma, related, disorders, or, adhd, being, mis, identified, as, the, other, additionally, traumatic, events, in, childhood, are, a, risk, factor, for, adhd, they, can, lead, to, structural, brain, changes, and, the, development, of, adhd, behaviours, finally, the, behavioural, consequences, of, adhd, symptoms, cause, a, higher, chance, of, the, individual, experiencing, trauma, and, therefore, adhd, leads, to, a, concrete, diagnosis, of, a, trauma, related, disorder, some, non, psychiatric, conditions, are, also, comorbidities, of, adhd, this, includes, epilepsy, a, neurological, condition, characterised, by, recurrent, seizures, there, are, well, established, associations, between, adhd, and, obesity, asthma, and, sleep, disorders, and, an, association, with, celiac, disease, children, with, adhd, have, a, higher, risk, for, migraine, headaches, but, have, no, increased, risk, of, tension, type, headaches, children, with, adhd, may, also, experience, headaches, as, a, result, of, medication, a, 2021, review, reported, that, several, neurometabolic, disorders, caused, by, inborn, errors, of, metabolism, converge, on, common, neurochemical, mechanisms, that, interfere, with, biological, mechanisms, also, considered, central, in, adhd, pathophysiology, and, treatment, this, highlights, the, importance, of, close, collaboration, between, health, services, to, avoid, clinical, overshadowing, in, june, 2021, neuroscience, biobehavioral, reviews, published, a, systematic, review, of, 82, studies, that, all, confirmed, or, implied, elevated, accident, proneness, in, adhd, patients, and, whose, data,

developmental, neuropsychology, published, a, systematic, review, of, 11, studies, where, the, data, from, all, but, one, study, suggested, that, heightened, screen, time, for, children, is, associated, with, attention, problems, in, july, 2022, the, journal, of, behavioral, addictions, published, a, meta, analysis, of, 14, studies, comprising, 2, 488, subjects, aged, 6, to, 18, years, that, found, significantly, more, severe, problematic, internet, use, in, subjects, diagnosed, with, adhd, to, control, groups, systematic, reviews, in, 2017, and, 2020, found, strong, evidence, that, adhd, is, associated, with, increased, suicide, risk, across, all, age, groups, as, well, as, growing, evidence, that, an, adhd, diagnosis, in, childhood, or, adolescence, represents, a, significant, future, suicidal, risk, factor, potential, causes, include, adhd, s, association, with, functional, impairment, negative, social, educational, and, occupational, outcomes, and, financial, distress, a, 2019, meta, analysis, indicated, a, significant, association, between, adhd, and, suicidal, spectrum, behaviours, suicidal, attempts, ideations, plans, and, completed, suicides, across, the, studies, examined, the, prevalence, of, suicide, attempts, in, individuals, with, adhd, was, 18, 9, compared, to, 9, 3, in, individuals, without, adhd, and, the, findings, were, substantially, replicated, among, studies, which, adjusted, for, other, variables, however, the, relationship, between, adhd, and, suicidal, spectrum, behaviours, remains, unclear, due, to, mixed, findings, across, individual, studies, and, the, complicating, impact, of, comorbid, psychiatric, disorders, there, is, no, clear, data, on, whether, there, is, a, direct, relationship, between, adhd, and, suicidality, or, whether, adhd, increases, suicide, risk, through, comorbidities, adhd, arises, from, brain, maldevelopment, especially, in, the, prefrontal, executive, networks, that, can, arise, either, from, genetic, factors, different, gene, variants, and, mutations, for, building, and, regulating, such, networks, or, from, acquired, disruptions, to, the, development, of, these, networks, and, regions, involved, in, executive, functioning, and, self, regulation, their, reduced, size, functional, connectivity, and, activation, contribute, to, the, pathophysiology, of, adhd, as, well, as, imbalances, in, the, noradrenergic, and, dopaminergic, systems, that, mediate, these, brain, regions, genetic, factors, play, an, important, role, adhd, has, a, heritability, rate, of, 70, 80, the, remaining, 20, 30, of, variance, is, mediated, by, de, novo, mutations, and, non, shared, environmental, factors, that, provide, for, or, produce, brain, injuries, there, is, no, significant, contribution, of, the, rearing, family, and, social, environment, very, rarely, adhd, can, also, be, the, result, of, abnormalities, in, the, chromosomes, in, november, 1999, biological, psychiatry, published, a, literature, review, by, psychiatrists, joseph, biederman, and, thomas, spencer, found, the, average, heritability, estimate, of, adhd, from, twin, studies, to, be, 0, 8, while, a, subsequent, family, twin, and, adoption, studies, literature, review, published, in, molecular, psychiatry, in, april, 2019, by, psychologists, stephen, faraone, and, henrik, larsson, that, found, an, average, heritability, estimate, of, 0, 74, additionally, evolutionary, psychiatrist, randolph, m, nesse, has, argued, that, the, 5, 1, male, to, female, sex, ratio, in, the, epidemiology, of, adhd, suggests, that, adhd, may, be, the, end, of, a, continuum, where, males, are, overrepresented, at, the, tails, citing, clinical, psychologist, simon, baron, cohen, s, suggestion, for, the, sex, ratio, in, the, epidemiology, of, autism, as, an, analogue, natural, selection, has, been, acting, against, the, genetic, variants, for, adhd, over, the, course, of, at, least, 45, 000, years, indicating, that, it, was, not, an, adaptative, trait, in, ancient, times, the, disorder, may, remain, at, a, stable, rate, by, the, balance, of, genetic, mutations, and, removal, rate, natural, selection, across, generations, over, thousands, of, years, these, genetic, variants, become, more, stable, decreasing, disorder, prevalence, throughout, human, evolution, the, efs, involved, in, adhd, likely, provide, the, capacity, to, bind, contingencies, across, time, thereby, directing, behaviour, toward, future, over, immediate, events, so, as, to, maximise, future, social, consequences, for, humans, adhd, has, a, high, heritability, of, 74, meaning, that, 74, of, the, presence, of, adhd, in, the, population, is, due, to, genetic, factors, there, are, multiple, gene, variants, which, each, slightly, increase, the, likelihood, of, a, person, having, adhd, it, is, polygenic, and, thus, arises, through, the, accumulation, of, many, genetic, risks, each, having, a, very, small, effect, the, siblings, of, children, with, adhd, are, three, to, four, times, more, likely, to, develop, the, disorder, than, siblings, of, children, without, the, disorder, the, association, of, maternal, smoking, observed, in, large, population, studies, disappears, after, adjusting, for, family, history, of, adhd, which, indicates, that, the, association, between, maternal, smoking, during, pregnancy, and, adhd, is, due, to, familial, or, genetic, factors, that, increase, the, risk, for, the, confluence, of, smoking, and, adhd, adhd, presents, with, reduced, size, functional, connectivity, and, activation, as, well, as, low, noradrenergic, and, dopaminergic, functioning, in, brain, regions, and, networks, crucial, for, executive, functioning, and, self, regulation, typically, a, number, of, genes, are, involved, many, of, which, directly, affect, brain, functioning, and, neurotransmission, those, involved, with, dopamine, include, dat, drd4, drd5, taar1, maoa, comt, and, dbh, other, genes, associated, with, adhd, include, sert, htr1b, snap25, grin2a, adra2a, tph2, and, bdnf, a, common, variant, of, a, gene, called, latrophilin, 3, is, estimated, to, be, responsible, for, about, 9, of, cases, and, when, this, variant, is, present, people, are, particularly, responsive, to, stimulant, medication, the, 7, repeat, variant, of, dopamine, receptor, d4, drd4, 7r, causes, increased, inhibitory, effects, induced, by, dopamine, and, is, associated, with, adhd, the, drd4, receptor, is, a, g, protein, coupled, receptor, that, inhibits, adenylyl, cyclase, the, drd4, 7r, mutation, results, in, a, wide, range, of, behavioural, phenotypes, including, adhd, symptoms, reflecting, split, attention, the, drd4, gene, is, both, linked, to, novelty, seeking, and, adhd, the, genes, gfod1, and, cdh13, show, strong, genetic, associations, with, adhd, cdh13, s, association, with, asd, schizophrenia, bipolar, disorder, and, depression, make, it, an, interesting, candidate, causative, gene, another, candidate, causative, gene, that, has, been, identified, is, adgrl3, in, zebrafish, knockout, of, this, gene, causes, a, loss, of, dopaminergic, function, in, the, ventral, diencephalon, and, the, fish, display, a, hyperactive, impulsive, phenotype, for, genetic, variation, to, be, used, as, a, tool, for, diagnosis, more, validating, studies, need, to, be, performed, however, smaller, studies, have, shown, that, genetic, polymorphisms, in, genes, related, to, catecholaminergic, neurotransmission, or, the, snare, complex, of, the, synapse, can, reliably, predict, a, person, s, response, to, stimulant, medication, rare, genetic, variants, show, more, relevant, clinical, significance, as, their, penetrance, the, chance, of, developing, the, disorder, tends, to, be, much, higher, however, their, usefulness, as, tools, for, diagnosis, is, limited, as, no, single, gene, predicts, adhd, asd, shows, genetic, overlap, with, adhd, at, both, common, and, rare, levels, of, genetic, variation, in, addition, to, genetics, some, environmental, factors, might, play, a, role, in, causing, adhd, alcohol, intake, during, pregnancy, can, cause, fetal, alcohol, spectrum, disorders, which, can, include, adhd, or, symptoms, like, it, children, exposed, to, certain, toxic, substances, such, as, lead, or, polychlorinated, biphenyls, may, develop, problems, which, resemble, adhd, exposure, to, the, organophosphate, insecticides, chlorpyrifos, and, dialkyl, phosphate, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, however, the, evidence, is, not, conclusive, exposure, to, tobacco, smoke, during, pregnancy, can, cause, problems, with, central, nervous, system, development, and, can, increase, the, risk, of, adhd, nicotine, exposure, during, pregnancy, may, be, an, environmental, risk, extreme, premature, birth, very, low, birth, weight, and, extreme, neglect, abuse, or, social, deprivation, also, increase, the, risk, as, do, certain, infections, during, pregnancy, at, birth, and, in, early, childhood, these, infections, include, among, others, various, viruses, measles, varicella, zoster, encephalitis, rubella, enterovirus, 71, at, least, 30, of, children, with, a, traumatic, brain, injury, later, develop, adhd, and, about, 5, of, cases, are, due, to, brain, damage, some, studies, suggest, that, in, a, small, number, of, children, artificial, food, dyes, or, preservatives, may, be, associated, with, an, increased, prevalence, of, adhd, or, adhd, like, symptoms, but, the, evidence, is, weak, and, may, apply, to, only, children, with, food, sensitivities, the, european, union, has, put, in, place, regulatory, measures, based, on, these, concerns, in, a, minority, of, children, intolerances, or, allergies, to, certain, foods, may, worsen, adhd, symptoms, individuals, with, hypokalemic, sensory, overstimulation, are, sometimes, diagnosed, as, having, adhd, raising, the, possibility, that, a, subtype, of, adhd, has, a, cause, that, can, be, understood, mechanistically, and, treated, in, a, novel, way, the, sensory, overload, is, treatable, with, oral, potassium, gluconate, research, does, not, support, popular, beliefs, that, adhd, is, caused, by, eating, too, much, refined, sugar, watching, too, much, television, bad, parenting, poverty, or, family, chaos, however, they, might, worsen, adhd, symptoms, in, certain, people, in, some, cases, an, inappropriate, diagnosis, of, adhd, may, reflect, a, dysfunctional, family, or, a, poor, educational, system, rather, than, any, true, presence, of, adhd, in, the, individual, in, other, cases, it, may, be, explained, by, increasing, academic, expectations, with, a, diagnosis, being, a, method, for, parents, in, some, countries, to, get, extra, financial, and, educational, support, for, their, child, behaviours, typical, of, adhd, occur, more, commonly, in, children, who, have, experienced, violence, and, emotional, abuse, current, models, of, adhd, suggest, that, it, is, associated, with, functional, impairments, in, some, of, the, brain, s, neurotransmitter, systems, particularly, those, involving, dopamine, and, norepinephrine, the, dopamine, and, norepinephrine, pathways, that, originate, in, the, ventral, tegmental, area, and, locus, coeruleus, project, to, diverse, regions, of, the, brain, and, govern, a, variety, of, cognitive, processes, the, dopamine, pathways, and, norepinephrine, pathways, which, project, to, the, prefrontal, cortex, and, striatum, are, directly, responsible, for, modulating, executive, function, cognitive, control, of, behaviour, motivation, reward, perception, and, motor, function, these, pathways, are, known, to, play, a, central, role, in, the, pathophysiology, of, adhd, larger, models, of, adhd, with, additional, pathways, have, been, proposed, in, children, with, adhd, there, is, a, general, reduction, of, volume, in, certain, brain, structures, with, a, proportionally, greater, decrease, in, the, volume, in, the, left, sided, prefrontal, cortex, the, posterior, parietal, cortex, also, shows, thinning, in, individuals, with, adhd, compared, to, controls, other, brain, structures, in, the, prefrontal, striatal, cerebellar, and, prefrontal, striatal, thalamic, circuits, have, also, been, found, to, differ, between, people, with, and, without, adhd, the, subcortical, volumes, of, the, accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, and, putamen, appears, smaller, in, individuals, with, adhd, compared, with, controls, structural, mri, studies, have, also, revealed, differences, in, white, matter, with, marked, differences, in, inter, hemispheric, asymmetry, between, adhd, and, typically, developing, youths, functional, mri, fmri, studies, have, revealed, a, number, of, differences, between, adhd, and, control, brains, mirroring, what, is, known, from, structural, findings, fmri, studies, have, showed, evidence, for, a, higher, connectivity, between, subcortical, and, cortical, regions, such, as, between, the, caudate, and, prefrontal, cortex, the, degree, of, hyperconnectivity, between, these, regions, correlated, with, the, severity, of, inattention, or, hyperactivity, hemispheric, lateralization, processes, have, also, been, postulated, as, being, implicated, in, adhd, but, empiric, results, showed, contrasting, evidence, on, the, topic, previously, it, had, been, suggested, that, the, elevated, number, of, dopamine, transporters, in, people, with, adhd, was, part, of, the, pathophysiology, but, it, appears, the, elevated, numbers, may, be, due, to, adaptation, following, exposure, to, stimulant, medication, current, models, involve, the, mesocorticolimbic, dopamine, pathway, and, the, locus, coeruleus, noradrenergic, system, adhd, psychostimulants, possess, treatment, efficacy, because, they, increase, neurotransmitter, activity, in, these, systems, there, may, additionally, be, abnormalities, in, serotonergic, glutamatergic, or, cholinergic, pathways, adhd, arises, from, a, core, deficit, in, executive, functions, e, g, attentional, control, inhibitory, control, and, working, memory, which, are, a, set, of, cognitive, processes, that, are, required, to, successfully, select, and, monitor, behaviours, that, facilitate, the, attainment, of, one, s, chosen, goals, the, executive, function, impairments, that, occur, in, adhd, individuals, result, in, problems, with, staying, organised, time, keeping, excessive, procrastination, maintaining, concentration, paying, attention, ignoring, distractions, regulating, emotions, and, remembering, details, people, with, adhd, appear, to, have, unimpaired, long, term, memory, and, deficits, in, long, term, recall, appear, to, be, attributed, to, impairments, in, working, memory, due, to, the, rates, of, brain, maturation, and, the, increasing, demands, for, executive, control, as, a, person, gets, older, adhd, impairments, may, not, fully, manifest, themselves, until, adolescence, or, even, early, adulthood, conversely, brain, maturation, trajectories, potentially, exhibiting, diverging, longitudinal, trends, in, adhd, may, support, a, later, improvement, in, executive, functions, after, reaching, adulthood, adhd, has, also, been, associated, with, motivational, deficits, in, children, children, with, adhd, often, find, it, difficult, to, focus, on, long, term, over, short, term, rewards, and, exhibit, impulsive, behaviour, for, short, term, rewards, another, sign, of, the, structurally, altered, signal, processing, in, the, central, nervous, system, in, this, group, of, people, is, the, conspicuously, common, paradoxical, reaction, c, 10, 20, of, patients, these, are, unexpected, reactions, in, the, opposite, direction, as, with, a, normal, effect, or, otherwise, significant, different, reactions, these, are, reactions, to, neuroactive, substances, such, as, local, anesthetic, at, the, dentist, sedative, caffeine, antihistamine, weak, neuroleptics, and, central, and, peripheral, painkillers, since, the, causes, of, paradoxical, reactions, are, at, least, partly, genetic, it, may, be, useful, in, critical, situations, for, example, before, operations, to, ask, whether, such, abnormalities, may, also, exist, in, family, members, adhd, is, diagnosed, by, an, assessment, of, a, person, s, behavioural, and, mental, development, including, ruling, out, the, effects, of, drugs, medications, and, other, medical, or, psychiatric, problems, as, explanations, for, the, symptoms, adhd, diagnosis, often, takes, into, account, feedback, from, parents, and, teachers, with, most, diagnoses, begun, after, a, teacher, raises, concerns, while, many, tools, exist, to, aid, in, the, diagnosis, of, adhd, their, validity, varies, in, different, populations, and, a, reliable, and, valid, diagnosis, requires, confirmation, by, a, clinician, while, supplemented, by, standardized, rating, scales, and, input, from, multiple, informants, across, various, settings, the, diagnosis, of, adhd, has, been, criticised, as, being, subjective, because, it, is, not, based, on, a, biological, test, the, international, consensus, statement, on, adhd, concluded, that, this, criticism, is, unfounded, on, the, basis, that, adhd, meets, standard, criteria, for, validity, of, a, mental, disorder, established, by, robins, and, guze, they, attest, that, the, disorder, is, considered, valid, because, 1, well, trained, professionals, in, a, variety, of, settings, and, cultures, agree, on, its, presence, or, absence, using, well, defined, criteria, and, 2, the, diagnosis, is, useful, for, predicting, a, additional, problems, the, patient, may, have, e, g, difficulties, learning, in, school, b, future, patient, outcomes, e, g, risk, for, future, drug, abuse, c, response, to, treatment, e, g, medications, and, psychological, treatments, and, d, features, that, indicate, a, consistent, set, of, causes, for, the, disorder, e, g, findings, from, genetics, or, brain, imaging, and, that, professional, associations, have, endorsed, and, published, guidelines, for, diagnosing, adhd, the, most, commonly, used, rating, scales, for, diagnosing, adhd, are, the, achenbach, system, of, empirically, based, assessment, aseba, and, include, the, child, behavior, checklist, cbcl, used, for, parents, to, rate, their, child, s, behaviour, the, youth, self, report, form, ysr, used, for, children, to, rate, their, own, behaviour, and, the, teacher, report, form, trf, used, for, teachers, to, rate, their, pupil, s,

report, or, self, assessment, from, the, adolescent, have, high, internal, consistency, as, a, diagnostic, tool, meaning, that, the, items, within, the, scale, are, highly, interrelated, the, reliability, of, the, scales, between, raters, i, e, their, degree, of, agreement, however, is, poor, to, moderate, making, it, important, to, include, information, from, multiple, raters, to, best, inform, a, diagnosis, imaging, studies, of, the, brain, do, not, give, consistent, results, between, individuals, thus, they, are, only, used, for, research, purposes, and, not, a, diagnosis, electroencephalography, is, not, accurate, enough, to, make, an, adhd, diagnosis, a, 2024, systematic, review, concluded, that, the, use, of, biomarkers, such, as, blood, or, urine, samples, electroencephalogram, eeg, markers, and, neuroimaging, such, as, mris, in, diagnosis, for, adhd, remains, unclear, studies, showed, great, variability, did, not, assess, test, retest, reliability, and, were, not, independently, replicable, in, north, america, and, australia, dsm, 5, criteria, are, used, for, diagnosis, while, european, countries, usually, use, the, icd, 10, the, dsm, iv, criteria, for, diagnosis, of, adhd, is, 3, 4, times, more, likely, to, diagnose, adhd, than, is, the, icd, 10, criteria, adhd, is, alternately, classified, as, neurodevelopmental, disorder, or, a, disruptive, behaviour, disorder, along, with, odd, cd, and, antisocial, personality, disorder, a, diagnosis, does, not, imply, a, neurological, disorder, very, few, studies, have, been, conducted, on, diagnosis, of, adhd, on, children, younger, than, 7, years, of, age, and, those, that, have, were, found, in, a, 2024, systematic, review, to, be, of, low, or, insufficient, strength, of, evidence, as, with, many, other, psychiatric, disorders, a, formal, diagnosis, should, be, made, by, a, qualified, professional, based, on, a, set, number, of, criteria, in, the, united, states, these, criteria, are, defined, by, the, american, psychiatric, association, in, the, dsm, based, on, the, dsm, 5, criteria, published, in, 2013, and, the, dsm, 5, tr, criteria, published, in, 2022, there, are, three, presentations, of, adhd, this, subdivision, is, based, on, presence, of, at, least, six, in, children, or, five, in, older, teenagers, and, adults, out, of, nine, long, term, lasting, at, least, six, months, symptoms, of, inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, or, both, to, be, considered, several, symptoms, must, have, appeared, by, the, age, of, six, to, twelve, and, occur, in, more, than, one, environment, e, g, at, home, and, at, school, or, work, the, symptoms, must, be, inappropriate, for, a, child, of, that, age, and, there, must, be, clear, evidence, that, they, are, causing, impairment, in, multiple, domains, of, life, the, dsm, 5, and, the, dsm, 5, tr, also, provide, two, diagnoses, for, individuals, who, have, symptoms, of, adhd, but, do, not, entirely, meet, the, requirements, other, specified, adhd, allows, the, clinician, to, describe, why, the, individual, does, not, meet, the, criteria, whereas, unspecified, adhd, is, used, where, the, clinician, chooses, not, to, describe, the, reason, in, the, eleventh, revision, of, the, international, statistical, classification, of, diseases, and, related, health, problems, icd, 11, by, the, world, health, organization, the, disorder, is, classified, as, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, code, 6a05, the, defined, subtypes, are, predominantly, inattentive, presentation, 6a05, 0, predominantly, hyperactive, impulsive, presentation, 6a05, 1, and, combined, presentation, 6a05, 2, however, the, icd, 11, includes, two, residual, categories, for, individuals, who, do, not, entirely, match, any, of, the, defined, subtypes, other, specified, presentation, 6a05, y, where, the, clinician, includes, detail, on, the, individual, s, presentation, and, presentation, unspecified, 6a05, z, where, the, clinician, does, not, provide, detail, in, the, tenth, revision, icd, 10, the, symptoms, of, hyperkinetic, disorder, were, analogous, to, adhd, in, the, icd, 11, when, a, conduct, disorder, as, defined, by, icd, 10, is, present, the, condition, was, referred, to, as, hyperkinetic, conduct, disorder, otherwise, the, disorder, was, classified, as, disturbance, of, activity, and, attention, other, hyperkinetic, disorders, or, hyperkinetic, disorders, unspecified, the, latter, was, sometimes, referred, to, as, hyperkinetic, syndrome, the, social, construct, theory, of, adhd, suggests, that, because, the, boundaries, between, normal, and, abnormal, behaviour, are, socially, constructed, i, e, jointly, created, and, validated, by, all, members, of, society, and, in, particular, by, physicians, parents, teachers, and, others, it, then, follows, that, subjective, valuations, and, judgements, determine, which, diagnostic, criteria, are, used, and, thus, the, number, of, people, affected, thomas, szasz, a, supporter, of, this, theory, has, argued, that, adhd, was, invented, and, then, given, a, name, adults, with, adhd, are, diagnosed, under, the, same, criteria, including, that, their, signs, must, have, been, present, by, the, age, of, six, to, twelve, the, individual, is, the, best, source, for, information, in, diagnosis, however, others, may, provide, useful, information, about, the, individual, s, symptoms, currently, and, in, childhood, a, family, history, of, adhd, also, adds, weight, to, a, diagnosis, 7, 9, while, the, core, symptoms, of, adhd, are, similar, in, children, and, adults, they, often, present, differently, in, adults, than, in, children, for, example, excessive, physical, activity, seen, in, children, may, present, as, feelings, of, restlessness, and, constant, mental, activity, in, adults, 6, worldwide, it, is, estimated, that, 2, 58, of, adults, have, persistent, adhd, where, the, individual, currently, meets, the, criteria, and, there, is, evidence, of, childhood, onset, and, 6, 76, of, adults, have, symptomatic, adhd, meaning, that, they, currently, meet, the, criteria, for, adhd, regardless, of, childhood, onset, in, 2020, this, was, 139, 84, million, and, 366, 33, million, affected, adults, respectively, around, 15, of, children, with, adhd, continue, to, meet, full, dsm, iv, tr, criteria, at, 25, years, of, age, and, 50, still, experience, some, symptoms, 2, as, of, 2010, most, adults, remain, untreated, many, adults, with, adhd, without, diagnosis, and, treatment, have, a, disorganised, life, and, some, use, non, prescribed, drugs, or, alcohol, as, a, coping, mechanism, other, problems, may, include, relationship, and, job, difficulties, and, an, increased, risk, of, criminal, activities, 6, associated, mental, health, problems, include, depression, anxiety, disorders, and, learning, disabilities, some, adhd, symptoms, in, adults, differ, from, those, seen, in, children, while, children, with, adhd, may, climb, and, run, about, excessively, adults, may, experience, an, inability, to, relax, or, may, talk, excessively, in, social, situations, 6, adults, with, adhd, may, start, relationships, impulsively, display, sensation, seeking, behaviour, and, be, short, tempered, 6, addictive, behaviour, such, as, substance, abuse, and, gambling, are, common, 6, this, led, to, those, who, presented, differently, as, they, aged, having, outgrown, the, dsm, iv, criteria, 5, 6, the, dsm, 5, criteria, does, specifically, deal, with, adults, unlike, that, of, dsm, iv, which, does, not, fully, take, into, account, the, differences, in, impairments, seen, in, adulthood, compared, to, childhood, 5, for, diagnosis, in, an, adult, having, symptoms, since, childhood, is, required, nevertheless, a, proportion, of, adults, who, meet, the, criteria, for, adhd, in, adulthood, would, not, have, been, diagnosed, with, adhd, as, children, most, cases, of, late, onset, adhd, develop, the, disorder, between, the, ages, of, 12, 16, and, may, therefore, be, considered, early, adult, or, adolescent, onset, adhd, in, manic, state, in, depressive, state, the, dsm, provides, differential, diagnoses, potential, alternate, explanations, for, specific, symptoms, assessment, and, investigation, of, clinical, history, determines, which, is, the, most, appropriate, diagnosis, the, dsm, 5, suggests, odd, intermittent, explosive, disorder, and, other, neurodevelopmental, disorders, such, as, stereotypic, movement, disorder, and, tourette, s, disorder, in, addition, to, specific, learning, disorder, intellectual, developmental, disorder, asd, reactive, attachment, disorder, anxiety, disorders, depressive, disorders, bipolar, disorder, disruptive, mood, dysregulation, disorder, substance, use, disorder, personality, disorders, psychotic, disorders, medication, induced, symptoms, and, neurocognitive, disorders, many, but, not, all, of, these, are, also, common, comorbidities, of, adhd, the, dsm, 5, tr, also, suggests, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, symptoms, of, adhd, such, as, low, mood, and, poor, self, image, mood, swings, and, irritability, can, be, confused, with, dysthymia, cyclothymia, or, bipolar, disorder, as, well, as, with, borderline, personality, disorder, 10, some, symptoms, that, are, due, to, anxiety, disorders, personality, disorder, developmental, disabilities, or, intellectual, disability, or, the, effects, of, substance, abuse, such, as, intoxication, and, withdrawal, can, overlap, with, adhd, these, disorders, can, also, sometimes, occur, along, with, adhd, medical, conditions, which, can, cause, adhd, type, symptoms, include, hyperthyroidism, seizure, disorder, lead, toxicity, hearing, deficits, hepatic, disease, sleep, apnea, drug, interactions, untreated, celiac, disease, and, head, injury, primary, sleep, disorders, may, affect, attention, and, behaviour, and, the, symptoms, of, adhd, may, affect, sleep, it, is, thus, recommended, that, children, with, adhd, be, regularly, assessed, for, sleep, problems, sleepiness, in, children, may, result, in, symptoms, ranging, from, the, classic, ones, of, yawning, and, rubbing, the, eyes, to, hyperactivity, and, inattentiveness, obstructive, sleep, apnea, can, also, cause, adhd, type, symptoms, the, management, of, adhd, typically, involves, counseling, or, medications, either, alone, or, in, combination, while, there, are, various, options, of, treatment, to, improve, adhd, symptoms, medication, therapies, substantially, improves, long, term, outcomes, and, while, completely, eliminating, some, elevated, risks, such, as, obesity, they, do, come, with, some, risks, of, adverse, events, medications, used, include, stimulants, atomoxetine, alpha, 2, adrenergic, receptor, agonists, and, sometimes, antidepressants, in, those, who, have, trouble, focusing, on, long, term, rewards, a, large, amount, of, positive, reinforcement, improves, task, performance, medications, are, the, most, effective, treatment, and, any, side, effects, are, typically, mild, and, easy, to, resolve, although, any, improvements, will, be, reverted, if, medication, is, ceased, adhd, stimulants, also, improve, persistence, and, task, performance, in, children, with, adhd, to, quote, one, systematic, review, recent, evidence, from, observational, and, registry, studies, indicates, that, pharmacological, treatment, of, adhd, is, associated, with, increased, achievement, and, decreased, absenteeism, at, school, a, reduced, risk, of, trauma, related, emergency, hospital, visits, reduced, risks, of, suicide, and, attempted, suicide, and, decreased, rates, of, substance, abuse, and, criminality, data, also, suggest, that, combining, medication, with, cbt, is, a, good, idea, although, cbt, is, substantially, less, effective, it, can, help, address, problems, that, reside, after, medication, has, been, optimised, the, nature, and, range, of, desirable, endpoints, of, adhd, treatment, vary, among, diagnostic, standards, for, adhd, in, most, studies, the, efficacy, of, treatment, is, determined, by, reductions, in, symptoms, however, some, studies, have, included, subjective, ratings, from, teachers, and, parents, as, part, of, their, assessment, of, treatment, efficacies, there, is, good, evidence, for, the, use, of, behavioural, therapies, in, adhd, they, are, the, recommended, first, line, treatment, in, those, who, have, mild, symptoms, or, who, are, preschool, aged, psychological, therapies, used, include, psychoeducational, input, behavior, therapy, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, interpersonal, psychotherapy, family, therapy, school, based, interventions, social, skills, training, behavioural, peer, intervention, organization, training, and, parent, management, training, neurofeedback, has, greater, treatment, effects, than, non, active, controls, for, up, to, 6, months, and, possibly, a, year, following, treatment, and, may, have, treatment, effects, comparable, to, active, controls, controls, proven, to, have, a, clinical, effect, over, that, time, period, despite, efficacy, in, research, there, is, insufficient, regulation, of, neurofeedback, practice, leading, to, ineffective, applications, and, false, claims, regarding, innovations, parent, training, may, improve, a, number, of, behavioural, problems, including, oppositional, and, non, compliant, behaviours, there, is, little, high, quality, research, on, the, effectiveness, of, family, therapy, for, adhd, but, the, existing, evidence, shows, that, it, is, similar, to, community, care, and, better, than, placebo, adhd, specific, support, groups, can, provide, information, and, may, help, families, cope, with, adhd, social, skills, training, behavioural, modification, and, medication, may, have, some, limited, beneficial, effects, in, peer, relationships, stable, high, quality, friendships, with, non, deviant, peers, protect, against, later, psychological, problems, several, clinical, trials, have, investigated, the, efficacy, of, digital, therapeutics, particularly, akili, interactive, labs, s, video, game, based, digital, therapeutic, akl, t01, marketed, as, endeavourrx, the, pediatric, stars, adhd, randomized, double, blind, parallel, group, controlled, trial, demonstrated, that, akl, t01, significantly, improved, performance, on, the, test, of, variables, of, attention, an, objective, measure, of, attention, and, inhibitory, control, compared, to, a, control, group, after, four, weeks, of, at, home, use, a, subsequent, pediatric, open, label, study, stars, adjunct, published, in, nature, portfolio, s, npj, digital, medicine, evaluated, akl, t01, as, an, adjunctive, treatment, for, children, with, adhd, who, were, either, on, stimulant, medication, or, not, on, stimulant, pharmacotherapy, results, showed, improvements, in, adhd, related, impairment, measured, by, the, impairment, rating, scale, and, adhd, symptoms, after, 4, weeks, of, treatment, with, effects, persisting, during, a, 4, week, pause, and, further, improving, with, an, additional, treatment, period, notably, the, magnitude, of, the, measured, improvement, was, similar, for, children, both, on, and, off, stimulants, in, 2020, akl, t01, received, marketing, authorization, for, pediatric, adhd, from, the, fda, becoming, the, first, game, based, therapeutic, granted, marketing, authorization, by, the, fda, for, any, type, of, condition, in, addition, to, pediatric, populations, a, 2023, study, in, the, journal, of, the, american, academy, of, child, adolescent, psychiatry, investigated, the, efficacy, and, safety, of, akl, t01, in, adults, with, adhd, after, six, weeks, of, at, home, treatment, with, akl, t01, participants, showed, significant, improvements, in, objective, measures, of, attention, tova, attention, comparison, score, reported, adhd, symptoms, adhd, rs, iv, inattention, subscale, and, total, score, and, reported, quality, of, life, aaqol, the, magnitude, of, improvement, in, attention, was, nearly, seven, times, greater, than, that, reported, in, pediatric, trials, the, treatment, was, well, tolerated, with, high, compliance, and, no, serious, adverse, events, the, medications, for, adhd, appear, to, alleviate, symptoms, via, their, effects, on, the, pre, frontal, executive, striatal, and, related, regions, and, networks, in, the, brain, usually, by, increasing, neurotransmission, of, norepinephrine, and, dopamine, methylphenidate, and, amphetamine, or, its, derivatives, are, often, first, line, treatments, for, adhd, about, 70, per, cent, respond, to, the, first, stimulant, tried, and, as, few, as, 10, per, cent, respond, to, neither, amphetamines, nor, methylphenidate, stimulants, may, also, reduce, the, risk, of, unintentional, injuries, in, children, with, adhd, magnetic, resonance, imaging, studies, suggest, that, long, term, treatment, with, amphetamine, or, methylphenidate, decreases, abnormalities, in, brain, structure, and, function, found, in, subjects, with, adhd, a, 2018, review, found, the, greatest, short, term, benefit, with, methylphenidate, in, children, and, amphetamines, in, adults, studies, and, meta, analyses, show, that, amphetamine, is, slightly, to, modestly, more, effective, than, methylphenidate, at, reducing, symptoms, and, they, are, more, effective, pharmacotherapy, for, adhd, than, 2, agonists, but, methylphenidate, has, comparable, efficacy, to, non, stimulants, such, as, atomoxetine, in, a, cochrane, clinical, synopsis, dr, storeb, and, colleagues, summarised, their, meta, review, on, methylphenidate, for, adhd, in, children, and, adolescents, the, meta, analysis, raised, substantial, doubts, about, the, drug, s, efficacy, relative, to, a, placebo, this, led, to, a, strong, critical, reaction, from, the, european, adhd, guidelines, group, and, individuals, in, the, scientific, community, who, identified, a, number, of, flaws, in, the, review, since, at, least, september, 2021, there, is, a, unanimous, and, global, scientific, consensus, that, methylphenidate, is, safe, and, highly, effective, for, treating, adhd, the, same, journal, released, a, subsequent, systematic, review, 2022, of, extended, release, methylphenidate, for, adults, concluding, similar, doubts, about, the, certainty, of, evidence, other, recent, systematic, reviews, and, meta, analyses, however, find, certainty, in, the, safety, and, high, efficacy, of, methylphenidate, for, reducing, adhd, symptoms, for, alleviating, the, underlying, executive, functioning, deficits, and, for, substantially, reducing, the, adverse, consequences, of, untreated, adhd, with, continuous, treatment, clinical, guidelines, internationally, are, also, consistent, in, approving, the, safety, and, efficacy, of, methylphenidate, and, recommending, it, as, a, first, line, treatment, for, the, disorder, safety, and, efficacy, data, have, been, reviewed, extensively, by, medical, regulators, e, g, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, and, the, european, medicines, agency, the, developers, of, evidence, based, international, guidelines, e, g, the, uk, national, institute, for, health, and, care, excellence, and, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, and, government, agencies, who, have, endorsed, these, guidelines, e, g, the, australian, national, health, and, medical, research, council, these, professional, groups, unanimously, conclude, based, on, the, scientific, evidence, that, methylphenidate, is, safe, and, effective, and, should, be, considered, as, a, first, line, treatment, for, adhd, the, likelihood, of, developing, insomnia, for, adhd, patients, taking, stimulants, has, been, measured, at, between, 11, and, 45, per, cent, for, different, medications, and, may, be, a, main, reason, for, discontinuation, other, side, effects, such, as, tics, decreased, appetite, and, weight, loss, or, emotional, lability, may, also, lead, to, discontinuation, stimulant, psychosis, and, mania, are, rare, at, therapeutic, doses, appearing, to, occur, in, approximately, 0, 1, of, individuals, within, the, first, several, weeks, after, starting, amphetamine, therapy, the, safety, of, these, medications, in, pregnancy, is, unclear, symptom, improvement, is, not, sustained, if, medication, is, ceased, the, long, term, effects, of, adhd, medication, have, yet, to, be, fully, determined, although, stimulants, are, generally, beneficial, and, safe, for, up, to, two, years, for, children, and, adolescents, a, 2022, meta, analysis, found, no, statistically, significant, association, between, adhd, medications, and, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, cvd, across, age, groups, although, the, study, suggests, further, investigation, is, warranted, for, patients, with, preexisting, cvd, as, well, as, long, term, medication, use, regular, monitoring, has, been, recommended, in, those, on, long, term, treatment, there, are, indications, suggesting, that, stimulant, therapy, for, children, and, adolescents, should, be, stopped, periodically, to, assess, continuing, need, for, medication, decrease, possible, growth, delay, and, reduce, tolerance, although, potentially, addictive, at, high, doses, stimulants, used, to, treat, adhd, have, low, potential, for, abuse, treatment, with, stimulants, is, either, protective, against, substance, abuse, or, has, no, effect, 12, the, majority, of, studies, on, nicotine, and, other, nicotinic, agonists, as, treatments, for, adhd, have, shown, favorable, results, however, no, nicotinic, drug, has, been, approved, for, adhd, treatment, caffeine, was, formerly, used, as, a, second, line, treatment, for, adhd, but, research, indicates, it, has, no, significant, effects, in, reducing, adhd, symptoms, caffeine, appears, to, help, with, alertness, arousal, and, reaction, time, but, not, the, type, of, inattention, implicated, in, adhd, sustained, attention, persistence, pseudoephedrine, and, ephedrine, do, not, affect, adhd, symptoms, modafinil, has, shown, some, efficacy, in, reducing, the, severity, of, adhd, in, children, and, adolescents, it, may, be, prescribed, off, label, to, treat, adhd, two, non, stimulant, medications, atomoxetine, and, viloxazine, are, approved, by, the, fda, and, in, other, countries, for, the, treatment, of, adhd, atomoxetine, due, to, its, lack, of, addiction, liability, may, be, preferred, in, those, who, are, at, risk, of, recreational, or, compulsive, stimulant, use, although, evidence, is, lacking, to, support, its, use, over, stimulants, for, this, reason, 13, atomoxetine, alleviates, adhd, symptoms, through, norepinephrine, reuptake, and, by, indirectly, increasing, dopamine, in, the, pre, frontal, cortex, sharing, 70, 80, of, the, brain, regions, with, stimulants, in, their, produced, effects, atomoxetine, has, been, shown, to, significantly, improve, academic, performance, meta, analyses, and, systematic, reviews, have, found, that, atomoxetine, has, comparable, efficacy, equal, tolerability, and, response, rate, 75, to, methylphenidate, in, children, and, adolescents, in, adults, efficacy, and, discontinuation, rates, are, equivalent, analyses, of, clinical, trial, data, suggests, that, viloxazine, is, about, as, effective, as, atomoxetine, and, methylphenidate, but, with, fewer, side, effects, amantadine, was, shown, to, induce, similar, improvements, in, children, treated, with, methylphenidate, with, less, frequent, side, effects, a, 2021, retrospective, study, showed, that, amantadine, may, serve, as, an, effective, adjunct, to, stimulants, for, adhd, related, symptoms, and, appears, to, be, a, safer, alternative, to, second, or, third, generation, antipsychotics, bupropion, is, also, used, off, label, by, some, clinicians, due, to, research, findings, it, is, effective, but, modestly, less, than, atomoxetine, and, methylphenidate, there, is, little, evidence, on, the, effects, of, medication, on, social, behaviours, antipsychotics, may, also, be, used, to, treat, aggression, in, adhd, alpha, 2a, agonists, two, alpha, 2a, agonists, extended, release, formulations, of, guanfacine, and, clonidine, are, approved, by, the, fda, and, in, other, countries, for, the, treatment, of, adhd, effective, in, children, and, adolescents, but, effectiveness, has, still, not, been, shown, for, adults, they, appear, to, be, modestly, less, effective, than, the, stimulants, amphetamine, and, methylphenidate, and, non, stimulants, atomoxetine, and, viloxazine, at, reducing, symptoms, but, can, be, useful, alternatives, or, used, in, conjunction, with, a, stimulant, these, medications, act, by, adjusting, the, alpha, 2a, ports, on, the, outside, of, noradrenergic, nerve, cells, in, the, pre, frontal, executive, networks, so, the, information, electrical, signal, is, less, confounded, by, noise, guidelines, on, when, to, use, medications, vary, by, country, the, united, kingdom, s, national, institute, for, health, and, care, excellence, recommends, use, for, children, only, in, severe, cases, though, for, adults, medication, is, a, first, line, treatment, conversely, most, united, states, guidelines, recommend, medications, in, most, age, groups, medications, are, especially, not, recommended, for, preschool, children, underdosing, of, stimulants, can, occur, and, can, result, in, a, lack, of, response, or, later, loss, of, effectiveness, this, is, particularly, common, in, adolescents, and, adults, as, approved, dosing, is, based, on, school, aged, children, causing, some, practitioners, to, use, weight, based, or, benefit, based, off, label, dosing, instead, exercise, does, not, reduce, the, symptoms, of, adhd, the, conclusion, by, the, international, consensus, statement, is, based, on, two, meta, analyses, one, of, 10, studies, with, 300, children, and, the, other, of, 15, studies, and, 668, participants, which, showed, that, exercise, yields, no, statistically, significant, reductions, on, adhd, symptoms, a, 2024, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, commissioned, by, the, patient, centered, outcomes, research, institute, pcori, identified, seven, studies, on, the, effectiveness, of, physical, exercise, for, treating, adhd, symptoms, the, type, and, amount, of, exercise, varied, widely, across, studies, from, martial, arts, interventions, to, treadmill, training, to, table, tennis, or, aerobic, exercise, effects, reported, were, not, replicated, causing, the, authors, to, conclude, that, there, is, insufficient, evidence, that, exercise, intervention, is, an, effective, form, of, treatment, for, adhd, symptoms, dietary, modifications, are, not, recommended, as, of, 2019, by, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, the, national, institute, for, health, and, care, excellence, or, the, agency, for, healthcare, research, and, quality, due, to, insufficient, evidence, a, 2013, meta, analysis, found, less, than, a, third, of, children, with, adhd, see, some, improvement, in, symptoms, with, free, fatty, acid, supplementation, or, decreased, consumption, of, artificial, food, colouring, these, benefits, may, be, limited, to, children, with, food, sensitivities, or, those, who, are, simultaneously, being, treated, with, adhd, medications, this, review, also, found, that, evidence, does, not, support, removing, other, foods, from, the, diet, to, treat, adhd, a, 2014, review, found, that, an, elimination, diet, results, in, a, small, overall, benefit, in, a, minority, of, children, such, as, those, with, allergies, a, 2016, review, stated, that, the, use, of, a, gluten, free, diet, as, standard, adhd, treatment, is, not, advised, a, 2017, review, showed, that, a, few, foods, elimination, diet, may, help, children, too, young, to, be, medicated, or, not, responding, to, medication, while, free, fatty, acid, supplementation, or, decreased, eating, of, artificial, food, colouring, as, standard, adhd, treatment, is, not, advised, chronic, deficiencies, of, iron, magnesium, and, iodine, may, have, a, negative, impact, on, adhd, symptoms, there, is, a, small, amount, of, evidence, that, lower, tissue, zinc, levels, may, be, associated, with, adhd, in, the, absence, of, a, demonstrated, zinc, deficiency, which, is, rare, outside, of, developing, countries, zinc, supplementation, is, not, recommended, as, treatment, for, adhd, however, zinc, supplementation, may, reduce, the, minimum, effective, dose, of, amphetamine, when, it, is, used, with, amphetamine, for, the, treatment, of, adhd, adhd, persists, into, adulthood, in, about, 30, 50, of, cases, those, affected, are, likely, to, develop, coping, mechanisms, as, they, mature, thus, compensating, to, some, extent, for, their, previous, symptoms, children, with, adhd, have, a, higher, risk, of, unintentional, injuries, effects, of, medication, on, functional, impairment, and, quality, of, life, e, g, reduced, risk, of, accidents, have, been, found, across, multiple, domains, rates, of, smoking, among, those, with, adhd, are, higher, than, in, the, general, population, at, about, 40, about, 30, 50, of, people, diagnosed, in, childhood, continue, to, have, adhd, in, adulthood, with, 2, 58, of, adults, estimated, to, have, adhd, which, began, in, childhood, in, adults, hyperactivity, is, usually, replaced, by, inner, restlessness, and, adults, often, develop, coping, skills, to, compensate, for, their, impairments, the, condition, can, be, difficult, to, tell, apart, from, other, conditions, as, well, as, from, high, levels, of, activity, within, the, range, of, normal, behaviour, adhd, has, a, negative, impact, on, patient, health, related, quality, of, life, that, may, be, further, exacerbated, by, or, may, increase, the, risk, of, other, psychiatric, conditions, such, as, anxiety, and, depression, individuals, with, adhd, may, also, face, misconceptions, and, stigma, individuals, with, adhd, are, significantly, overrepresented, in, prison, populations, although, there, is, no, generally, accepted, estimate, of, adhd, prevalence, among, inmates, a, 2015, meta, analysis, estimated, a, prevalence, of, 25, 5, and, a, larger, 2018, meta, analysis, estimated, the, frequency, to, be, 26, 2, adhd, is, estimated, to, affect, about, 6, 7, of, people, aged, 18, and, under, when, diagnosed, via, the, dsm, iv, criteria, when, diagnosed, via, the, icd, 10, criteria, rates, in, this, age, group, are, estimated, around, 1, 2, rates, are, similar, between, countries, and, differences, in, rates, depend, mostly, on, how, it, is, diagnosed, children, in, north, america, appear, to, have, a, higher, rate, of, adhd, than, children, in, africa, and, the, middle, east, this, is, believed, to, be, due, to, differing, methods, of, diagnosis, rather, than, a, difference, in, underlying, frequency, the, same, publication, which, describes, this, difference, also, notes, that, the, difference, may, be, rooted, in, the, available, studies, from, these, respective, regions, as, far, more, studies, were, from, north, america, than, from, africa, and, the, middle, east, as, of, 2019, it, was, estimated, to, affect, 84, 7, million, people, globally, adhd, is, diagnosed, approximately, twice, as, often, in, boys, as, in, girls, and, 1, 6, times, more, often, in, men, than, in, women, although, the, disorder, is, overlooked, in, girls, or, diagnosed, in, later, life, because, their, symptoms, sometimes, differ, from, diagnostic, criteria, in, 2014, keith, conners, one, of, the, early, advocates, for, recognition, of, the, disorder, spoke, out, against, overdiagnosis, in, a, new, york, times, article, in, contrast, a, 2014, peer, reviewed, medical, literature, review, indicated, that, adhd, is, underdiagnosed, in, adults, studies, from, multiple, countries, have, reported, that, children, born, closer, to, the, start, of, the, school, year, are, more, frequently, diagnosed, with, and, medicated, for, adhd, than, their, older, classmates, boys, who, were, born, in, december, where, the, school, age, cut, off, was, 31, december, were, shown, to, be, 30, more, likely, to, be, diagnosed, and, 41, more, likely, to, be, treated, than, those, born, in, january, girls, born, in, december, had, a, diagnosis, and, treatment, percentage, increase, of, 70, and, 77, respectively, compared, to, those, born, in, january, children, who, were, born, at, the, last, three, days, of, a, calendar, year, were, reported, to, have, significantly, higher, levels, of, diagnosis, and, treatment, for, adhd, than, children, born, at, the, first, three, days, of, a, calendar, year, the, studies, suggest, that, adhd, diagnosis, is, prone, to, subjective, analysis, rates, of, diagnosis, and, treatment, have, increased, in, both, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, since, the, 1970s, prior, to, 1970, it, was, rare, for, children, to, be, diagnosed, with, adhd, while, in, the, 1970s, rates, were, about, 1, this, is, believed, to, be, primarily, due, to, changes, in, how, the, condition, is, diagnosed, and, how, readily, people, are, willing, to, treat, it, with, medications, rather, than, a, true, change, in, incidence, with, widely, differing, rates, of, diagnosis, across, countries, states, within, countries, races, and, ethnicities, some, suspect, factors, other, than, symptoms, of, adhd, are, playing, a, role, in, diagnosis, such, as, cultural, norms, despite, showing, a, higher, frequency, of, symptoms, associated, with, adhd, non, white, children, in, the, us, are, less, likely, than, white, children, to, be, diagnosed, or, treated, for, adhd, a, finding, that, is, often, explained, by, bias, among, health, professionals, as, well, as, parents, who, may, be, reluctant, to, acknowledge, that, their, child, has, adhd, crosscultural, differences, in, diagnosis, of, adhd, can, also, be, attributed, to, the, long, lasting, effects, of, harmful, racially, targeted, medical, practices, medical, pseudosciences, particularly, those, that, targeted, black, populations, during, the, period, of, slavery, in, the, us, lead, to, a, distrust, of, medical, practices, within, certain, communities, the, combination, of, adhd, symptoms, often, being, regarded, as, misbehaviour, rather, than, as, a, psychiatric, condition, and, the, use, of, drugs, to, regulate, adhd, result, in, a, hesitancy, to, trust, a, diagnosis, of, adhd, cases, of, misdiagnosis, in, adhd, can, also, occur, due, to, stereotyping, of, people, of, color, due, to, adhd, s, subjectively, determined, symptoms, medical, professionals, may, diagnose, individuals, based, on, stereotyped, behaviour, or, misdiagnose, due, to, cultural, differences, in, symptom, presentation, adhd, was, officially, known, as, attention, deficit, disorder, add, from, 1980, to, 1987, prior, to, the, 1980s, it, was, known, as, hyperkinetic, reaction, of, childhood, symptoms, similar, to, those, of, adhd, have, been, described, in, medical, literature, dating, back, to, the, 18th, century, sir, alexander, crichton, describes, mental, restlessness, in, his, book, an, inquiry, into, the, nature, and, origin, of, mental, derangement, written, in, 1798, he, made, observations, about, children, showing, signs, of, being, inattentive, and, having, the, fidgets, the, first, clear, description, of, adhd, is, credited, to, george, still, in, 1902, during, a, series, of, lectures, he, gave, to, the, royal, college, of, physicians, of, london, the, terminology, used, to, describe, the, condition, has, changed, over, time, and, has, included, minimal, brain, dysfunction, in, the, dsm, i, 1952, hyperkinetic, reaction, of, childhood, in, the, dsm, ii, 1968, and, attention, deficit, disorder, with, or, without, hyperactivity, in, the, dsm, iii, 1980, in, 1987, this, was, changed, to, adhd, in, the, dsm, iii, r, and, in, 1994, the, dsm, iv, in, split, the, diagnosis, into, three, subtypes, adhd, inattentive, type, adhd, hyperactive, impulsive, type, and, adhd, combined, type, these, terms, were, kept, in, the, dsm, 5, in, 2013, and, in, the, dsm, 5, tr, in, 2022, prior, to, the, dsm, terms, included, minimal, brain, damage, in, the, 1930s, adhd, its, diagnosis, and, its, treatment, have, been, controversial, since, the, 1970s, positions, range, from, the, view, that, adhd, is, within, the, normal, range, of, behaviour, to, the, hypothesis, that, adhd, is, a, genetic, condition, other, areas, of, controversy, include, the, use, of, stimulant, medications, in, children, the, method, of, diagnosis, and, the, possibility, of, overdiagnosis, in, 2009, the, national, institute, for, health, and, care, excellence, states, that, the, current, treatments, and, methods, of, diagnosis, are, based, on, the, dominant, view, of, the, academic, literature, once, neuroimaging, studies, were, possible, studies, in, the, 1990s, provided, support, for, the, pre, existing, theory, that, neurological, differences, particularly, in, the, frontal, lobes, were, involved, in, adhd, a, genetic, component, was, identified, and, adhd, was, acknowledged, to, be, a, persistent, long, term, disorder, which, lasted, from, childhood, into, adulthood, adhd, was, split, into, the, current, three, sub, types, because, of, a, field, trial, completed, by, lahey, and, colleagues, and, published, in, 1994, in, 2021, global, teams, of, scientists, curated, the, international, consensus, statement, compiling, evidence, based, findings, about, the, disorder, in, 1934, benzedrine, became, the, first, amphetamine, medication, approved, for, use, in, the, united, states, methylphenidate, was, introduced, in, the, 1950s, and, enantiopure, dextroamphetamine, in, the, 1970s, the, use, of, stimulants, to, treat, adhd, was, first, described, in, 1937, charles, bradley, gave, the, children, with, behavioural, disorders, benzedrine, and, found, it, improved, academic, performance, and, behaviour, possible, positive, traits, of, adhd, are, a, new, avenue, of, research, and, therefore, limited, a, 2020, review, found, that, creativity, may, be, associated, with, adhd, symptoms, particularly, divergent, thinking, and, quantity, of, creative, achievements, but, not, with, the, disorder, of, adhd, itself, i, e, it, has, not, been, found, to, be, increased, in, people, diagnosed, with, the, disorder, only, in, people, with, subclinical, symptoms, or, those, that, possess, traits, associated, with, the, disorder, divergent, thinking, is, the, ability, to, produce, creative, solutions, which, differ, significantly, from, each, other, and, consider, the, issue, from, multiple, perspectives, those, with, adhd, symptoms, could, be, advantaged, in, this, form, of, creativity, as, they, tend, to, have, diffuse, attention, allowing, rapid, switching, between, aspects, of, the, task, under, consideration, flexible, associative, memory, allowing, them, to, remember, and, use, more, distantly, related, ideas, which, is, associated, with, creativity, and, impulsivity, allowing, them, to, consider, ideas, which, others, may, not, have, reviews, of, adhd, biomarkers, have, noted, that, platelet, monoamine, oxidase, expression, urinary, norepinephrine, urinary, mhpg, and, urinary, phenethylamine, levels, consistently, differ, between, adhd, individuals, and, non, adhd, controls, these, measurements, could, serve, as, diagnostic, biomarkers, for, adhd, but, more, research, is, needed, to, establish, their, diagnostic, utility, urinary, and, blood, plasma, phenethylamine, concentrations, are, lower, in, adhd, individuals, relative, to, controls, the, two, most, commonly, prescribed, drugs, for, adhd, amphetamine, and, methylphenidate, increase, phenethylamine, biosynthesis, in, treatment, responsive, individuals, with, adhd, lower, urinary, phenethylamine, concentrations, are, associated, with, symptoms, of, inattentiveness, in, adhd, individuals
