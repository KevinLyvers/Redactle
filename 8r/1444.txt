hearing, loss, is, a, partial, or, total, inability, to, hear, hearing, loss, may, be, present, at, birth, or, acquired, at, any, time, afterwards, hearing, loss, may, occur, in, one, or, both, ears, in, children, hearing, problems, can, affect, the, ability, to, acquire, spoken, language, and, in, adults, it, can, create, difficulties, with, social, interaction, and, at, work, hearing, loss, can, be, temporary, or, permanent, hearing, loss, related, to, age, usually, affects, both, ears, and, is, due, to, cochlear, hair, cell, loss, in, some, people, particularly, older, people, hearing, loss, can, result, in, loneliness, hearing, loss, may, be, caused, by, a, number, of, factors, including, genetics, ageing, exposure, to, noise, some, infections, birth, complications, trauma, to, the, ear, and, certain, medications, or, toxins, a, common, condition, that, results, in, hearing, loss, is, chronic, ear, infections, certain, infections, during, pregnancy, such, as, cytomegalovirus, syphilis, and, rubella, may, also, cause, hearing, loss, in, the, child, hearing, loss, is, diagnosed, when, hearing, testing, finds, that, a, person, is, unable, to, hear, 25, decibels, in, at, least, one, ear, testing, for, poor, hearing, is, recommended, for, all, newborns, hearing, loss, can, be, categorized, as, mild, 25, to, 40, db, moderate, 41, to, 55, db, moderate, severe, 56, to, 70, db, severe, 71, to, 90, db, or, profound, greater, than, 90, db, there, are, three, main, types, of, hearing, loss, conductive, hearing, loss, sensorineural, hearing, loss, and, mixed, hearing, loss, about, half, of, hearing, loss, globally, is, preventable, through, public, health, measures, such, practices, include, immunization, proper, care, around, pregnancy, avoiding, loud, noise, and, avoiding, certain, medications, the, world, health, organization, recommends, that, young, people, limit, exposure, to, loud, sounds, and, the, use, of, personal, audio, players, to, an, hour, a, day, in, an, effort, to, limit, exposure, to, noise, early, identification, and, support, are, particularly, important, in, children, for, many, hearing, aids, sign, language, cochlear, implants, and, subtitles, are, useful, lip, reading, is, another, useful, skill, some, develop, access, to, hearing, aids, however, is, limited, in, many, areas, of, the, world, as, of, 2013, hearing, loss, affects, about, 1, 1, billion, people, to, some, degree, it, causes, disability, in, about, 466, million, people, 5, of, the, global, population, and, moderate, to, severe, disability, in, 124, million, people, of, those, with, moderate, to, severe, disability, 108, million, live, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, of, those, with, hearing, loss, it, began, during, childhood, for, 65, million, those, who, use, sign, language, and, are, members, of, deaf, culture, may, see, themselves, as, having, a, difference, rather, than, a, disability, many, members, of, deaf, culture, oppose, attempts, to, cure, deafness, and, some, within, this, community, view, cochlear, implants, with, concern, as, they, have, the, potential, to, eliminate, their, culture, use, of, the, terms, hearing, impaired, deaf, mute, or, deaf, and, dumb, to, describe, deaf, and, hard, of, hearing, people, is, discouraged, by, many, in, the, deaf, community, as, well, as, advocacy, organizations, as, they, are, offensive, to, many, deaf, and, hard, of, hearing, people, human, hearing, extends, in, frequency, from, 20, to, 20, 000, hz, and, in, intensity, from, 0, db, to, 120, db, hl, or, more, 0, db, does, not, represent, absence, of, sound, but, rather, the, softest, sound, an, average, unimpaired, human, ear, can, hear, some, people, can, hear, down, to, 5, or, even, 10, db, sound, is, generally, uncomfortably, loud, above, 90, db, and, 115, db, represents, the, threshold, of, pain, the, ear, does, not, hear, all, frequencies, equally, well, hearing, sensitivity, peaks, around, 3, 000, hz, there, are, many, qualities, of, human, hearing, besides, frequency, range, and, intensity, that, cannot, easily, be, measured, quantitatively, however, for, many, practical, purposes, normal, hearing, is, defined, by, a, frequency, versus, intensity, graph, or, audiogram, charting, sensitivity, thresholds, of, hearing, at, defined, frequencies, because, of, the, cumulative, impact, of, age, and, exposure, to, noise, and, other, acoustic, insults, typical, hearing, may, not, be, normal, hearing, loss, is, sensory, but, may, have, accompanying, symptoms, there, may, also, be, accompanying, secondary, symptoms, hearing, loss, is, associated, with, alzheimer, s, disease, and, dementia, the, risk, increases, with, the, hearing, loss, degree, there, are, several, hypotheses, including, cognitive, resources, being, redistributed, to, hearing, and, social, isolation, from, hearing, loss, having, a, negative, effect, according, to, preliminary, data, hearing, aid, usage, can, slow, down, the, decline, in, cognitive, functions, hearing, loss, is, responsible, for, causing, thalamocortical, dysrthymia, in, the, brain, which, is, a, cause, for, several, neurological, disorders, including, tinnitus, and, visual, snow, syndrome, hearing, loss, is, an, increasing, concern, especially, in, aging, populations, the, prevalence, of, hearing, loss, increases, about, two, fold, for, each, decade, increase, in, age, after, age, 40, while, the, secular, trend, might, decrease, individual, level, risk, of, developing, hearing, loss, the, prevalence, of, hearing, loss, is, expected, to, rise, due, to, the, aging, population, in, the, us, another, concern, about, aging, process, is, cognitive, decline, which, may, progress, to, mild, cognitive, impairment, and, eventually, dementia, the, association, between, hearing, loss, and, cognitive, decline, has, been, studied, in, various, research, settings, despite, the, variability, in, study, design, and, protocols, the, majority, of, these, studies, have, found, consistent, association, between, age, related, hearing, loss, and, cognitive, decline, cognitive, impairment, and, dementia, the, association, between, age, related, hearing, loss, and, alzheimer, s, disease, was, found, to, be, nonsignificant, and, this, finding, supports, the, hypothesis, that, hearing, loss, is, associated, with, dementia, independent, of, alzheimer, pathology, there, are, several, hypotheses, about, the, underlying, causal, mechanism, for, age, related, hearing, loss, and, cognitive, decline, one, hypothesis, is, that, this, association, can, be, explained, by, common, etiology, or, shared, neurobiological, pathology, with, decline, in, other, physiological, system, another, possible, cognitive, mechanism, emphasize, on, individual, s, cognitive, load, as, people, developing, hearing, loss, in, the, process, of, aging, the, cognitive, load, demanded, by, auditory, perception, increases, which, may, lead, to, change, in, brain, structure, and, eventually, to, dementia, one, other, hypothesis, suggests, that, the, association, between, hearing, loss, and, cognitive, decline, is, mediated, through, various, psychosocial, factors, such, as, decrease, in, social, contact, and, increase, in, social, isolation, findings, on, the, association, between, hearing, loss, and, dementia, have, significant, public, health, implication, since, about, 9, of, dementia, cases, are, associated, with, hearing, loss, falls, have, important, health, implications, especially, for, an, aging, population, where, they, can, lead, to, significant, morbidity, and, mortality, elderly, people, are, particularly, vulnerable, to, the, consequences, of, injuries, caused, by, falls, since, older, individuals, typically, have, greater, bone, fragility, and, poorer, protective, reflexes, fall, related, injury, can, also, lead, to, burdens, on, the, financial, and, health, care, systems, in, literature, age, related, hearing, loss, is, found, to, be, significantly, associated, with, incident, falls, there, is, also, a, potential, dose, response, relationship, between, hearing, loss, and, falls, greater, severity, of, hearing, loss, is, associated, with, increased, difficulties, in, postural, control, and, increased, prevalence, of, falls, the, underlying, causal, link, between, the, association, of, hearing, loss, and, falls, is, yet, to, be, elucidated, there, are, several, hypotheses, that, indicate, that, there, may, be, a, common, process, between, decline, in, auditory, system, and, increase, in, incident, falls, driven, by, physiological, cognitive, and, behavioral, factors, this, evidence, suggests, that, treating, hearing, loss, has, potential, to, increase, health, related, quality, of, life, in, older, adults, depression, is, one, of, the, leading, causes, of, morbidity, and, mortality, worldwide, in, older, adults, the, suicide, rate, is, higher, than, it, is, for, younger, adults, and, more, suicide, cases, are, attributable, to, depression, different, studies, have, been, done, to, investigate, potential, risk, factors, that, can, give, rise, to, depression, in, later, life, some, chronic, diseases, are, found, to, be, significantly, associated, with, risk, of, developing, depression, such, as, coronary, heart, disease, pulmonary, disease, vision, loss, and, hearing, loss, hearing, loss, can, attribute, to, decrease, in, health, related, quality, of, life, increase, in, social, isolation, and, decline, in, social, engagement, which, are, all, risk, factors, for, increased, risk, of, developing, depression, symptoms, post, lingual, deafness, is, hearing, loss, that, is, sustained, after, the, acquisition, of, language, which, can, occur, due, to, disease, trauma, or, as, a, side, effect, of, a, medicine, typically, hearing, loss, is, gradual, and, often, detected, by, family, and, friends, of, affected, individuals, long, before, the, patients, themselves, will, acknowledge, the, disability, post, lingual, deafness, is, far, more, common, than, pre, lingual, deafness, those, who, lose, their, hearing, later, in, life, such, as, in, late, adolescence, or, adulthood, face, their, own, challenges, living, with, the, adaptations, that, allow, them, to, live, independently, prelingual, deafness, is, profound, hearing, loss, that, is, sustained, before, the, acquisition, of, language, which, can, occur, due, to, a, congenital, condition, or, through, hearing, loss, before, birth, or, in, early, infancy, prelingual, deafness, impairs, an, individual, s, ability, to, acquire, a, spoken, language, in, children, but, deaf, children, can, acquire, spoken, language, through, support, from, cochlear, implants, sometimes, combined, with, hearing, aids, non, signing, hearing, parents, of, deaf, babies, 90, 95, of, cases, usually, go, with, oral, approach, without, the, support, of, sign, language, as, these, families, lack, previous, experience, with, sign, language, and, cannot, competently, provide, it, to, their, children, without, learning, it, themselves, this, may, in, some, cases, late, implantation, or, not, sufficient, benefit, from, cochlear, implants, bring, the, risk, of, language, deprivation, for, the, deaf, baby, because, the, deaf, baby, would, not, have, a, sign, language, if, the, child, is, unable, to, acquire, spoken, language, successfully, the, 5, 10, of, cases, of, deaf, babies, born, into, signing, families, have, the, potential, of, age, appropriate, development, of, language, due, to, early, exposure, to, a, sign, language, by, sign, competent, parents, thus, they, have, the, potential, to, meet, language, milestones, in, sign, language, in, lieu, of, spoken, language, hearing, loss, has, multiple, causes, including, ageing, genetics, perinatal, problems, and, acquired, causes, like, noise, and, disease, for, some, kinds, of, hearing, loss, the, cause, may, be, classified, as, of, unknown, cause, there, is, a, progressive, loss, of, ability, to, hear, high, frequencies, with, aging, known, as, presbycusis, for, men, this, can, start, as, early, as, 25, and, women, at, 30, although, genetically, variable, it, is, a, normal, concomitant, of, ageing, and, is, distinct, from, hearing, losses, caused, by, noise, exposure, toxins, or, disease, agents, common, conditions, that, can, increase, the, risk, of, hearing, loss, in, elderly, people, are, high, blood, pressure, diabetes, hearing, loss, in, diabetes, or, the, use, of, certain, medications, harmful, to, the, ear, while, everyone, loses, hearing, with, age, the, amount, and, type, of, hearing, loss, is, variable, noise, induced, hearing, loss, nihl, also, known, as, acoustic, trauma, typically, manifests, as, elevated, hearing, thresholds, i, e, less, sensitivity, or, muting, noise, exposure, is, the, cause, of, approximately, half, of, all, cases, of, hearing, loss, causing, some, degree, of, problems, in, 5, of, the, population, globally, the, majority, of, hearing, loss, is, not, due, to, age, but, due, to, noise, exposure, various, governmental, industry, and, standards, organizations, set, noise, standards, many, people, are, unaware, of, the, presence, of, environmental, sound, at, damaging, levels, or, of, the, level, at, which, sound, becomes, harmful, common, sources, of, damaging, noise, levels, include, car, stereos, children, s, toys, motor, vehicles, crowds, lawn, and, maintenance, equipment, power, tools, gun, use, musical, instruments, and, even, hair, dryers, noise, damage, is, cumulative, all, sources, of, damage, must, be, considered, to, assess, risk, in, the, us, 12, 5, of, children, aged, 6, 19, years, have, permanent, hearing, damage, from, excessive, noise, exposure, the, world, health, organization, estimates, that, half, of, those, between, 12, and, 35, are, at, risk, from, using, personal, audio, devices, that, are, too, loud, hearing, loss, in, adolescents, may, be, caused, by, loud, noise, from, toys, music, by, headphones, and, concerts, or, events, hearing, loss, can, be, inherited, around, 75, 80, of, all, these, cases, are, inherited, by, recessive, genes, 20, 25, are, inherited, by, dominant, genes, 1, 2, are, inherited, by, x, linked, patterns, and, fewer, than, 1, are, inherited, by, mitochondrial, inheritance, syndromic, deafness, occurs, when, there, are, other, signs, or, medical, problems, aside, from, deafness, in, an, individual, such, as, usher, syndrome, stickler, syndrome, waardenburg, syndrome, alport, s, syndrome, and, neurofibromatosis, type, 2, nonsyndromic, deafness, occurs, when, there, are, no, other, signs, or, medical, problems, associated, with, the, deafness, in, an, individual, fetal, alcohol, spectrum, disorders, are, reported, to, cause, hearing, loss, in, up, to, 64, of, infants, born, to, alcoholic, mothers, from, the, ototoxic, effect, on, the, developing, fetus, plus, malnutrition, during, pregnancy, from, the, excess, alcohol, intake, premature, birth, can, be, associated, with, sensorineural, hearing, loss, because, of, an, increased, risk, of, hypoxia, hyperbilirubinaemia, ototoxic, medication, and, infection, as, well, as, noise, exposure, in, the, neonatal, units, also, hearing, loss, in, premature, babies, is, often, discovered, far, later, than, a, similar, hearing, loss, would, be, in, a, full, term, baby, because, normally, babies, are, given, a, hearing, test, within, 48, hours, of, birth, but, doctors, must, wait, until, the, premature, baby, is, medically, stable, before, testing, hearing, which, can, be, months, after, birth, the, risk, of, hearing, loss, is, greatest, for, those, weighing, less, than, 1500, g, at, birth, disorders, responsible, for, hearing, loss, include, auditory, neuropathy, down, syndrome, charcot, marie, tooth, disease, variant, 1e, autoimmune, disease, multiple, sclerosis, meningitis, cholesteatoma, otosclerosis, perilymph, fistula, m, ni, re, s, disease, recurring, ear, infections, strokes, superior, semicircular, canal, dehiscence, pierre, robin, treacher, collins, usher, syndrome, pendred, syndrome, and, turner, syndrome, syphilis, vestibular, schwannoma, and, viral, infections, such, as, measles, mumps, congenital, rubella, also, called, german, measles, syndrome, several, varieties, of, herpes, viruses, hiv, aids, and, west, nile, virus, some, medications, may, reversibly, or, irreversibly, affect, hearing, these, medications, are, considered, ototoxic, this, includes, loop, diuretics, such, as, furosemide, and, bumetanide, non, steroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, nsaids, both, over, the, counter, aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, as, well, as, prescription, celecoxib, diclofenac, etc, paracetamol, quinine, and, macrolide, antibiotics, others, may, cause, permanent, hearing, loss, the, most, important, group, is, the, aminoglycosides, main, member, gentamicin, and, platinum, based, chemotherapeutics, such, as, cisplatin, and, carboplatin, in, addition, to, medications, hearing, loss, can, also, result, from, specific, chemicals, in, the, environment, metals, such, as, lead, solvents, such, as, toluene, found, in, crude, oil, gasoline, and, automobile, exhaust, for, example, and, asphyxiants, combined, with, noise, these, ototoxic, chemicals, have, an, additive, effect, on, a, person, s, hearing, loss, hearing, loss, due, to, chemicals, starts, in, the, high, frequency, range, and, is, irreversible, it, damages, the, cochlea, with, lesions, and, degrades, central, portions, of, the, auditory, system, for, some, ototoxic, chemical, exposures, particularly, styrene, the, risk, of, hearing, loss, can, be, higher, than, being, exposed, to, noise, alone, the, effects, is, greatest, when, the, combined, exposure, include, impulse, noise, a, 2018, informational, bulletin, by, the, us, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, and, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, introduces, the, issue, provides, examples, of, ototoxic, chemicals, lists, the, industries, and, occupations, at, risk, and, provides, prevention, information, there, can, be, damage, either, to, the, ear, whether, the, external, or, middle, ear, to, the, cochlea, or, to, the, brain, centers, that, process, the, aural, information, conveyed, by, the, ears, damage, to, the, middle, ear, may, include, fracture, and, discontinuity, of, the, ossicular, chain, damage, to, the, inner, ear, cochlea, may, be, caused, by, temporal, bone, fracture, people, who, sustain, head, injury, are, especially, vulnerable, to, hearing, loss, or, tinnitus, either, temporary, or, permanent, sound, waves, reach, the, outer, ear, and, are, conducted, down, the, ear, canal, to, the, eardrum, causing, it, to, vibrate, the, vibrations, are, transferred, by, the, 3, tiny, ear, bones, of, the, middle, ear, to, the, fluid, in, the, inner, ear, the, fluid, moves, hair, cells, stereocilia, and, their, movement, generates, nerve, impulses, which, are, then, taken, to, the, brain, by, the, cochlear, nerve, the, auditory, nerve, takes, the, impulses, to, the, brainstem, which, sends, the, impulses, to, the, midbrain, finally, the, signal, goes, to, the, auditory, cortex, of, the, temporal, lobe, to, be, interpreted, as, sound, hearing, loss, is, most, commonly, caused, by, long, term, exposure, to, loud, noises, from, recreation, or, from, work, that, damage, the, hair, cells, which, do, not, grow, back, on, their, own, older, people, may, lose, their, hearing, from, long, exposure, to, noise, changes, in, the, inner, ear, changes, in, the, middle, ear, or, from, changes, along, the, nerves, from, the, ear, to, the, brain, identification, of, a, hearing, loss, is, usually, conducted, by, a, general, practitioner, medical, doctor, otolaryngologist, certified, and, licensed, audiologist, school, or, industrial, audiometrist, or, other, audiometric, technician, diagnosis, of, the, cause, of, a, hearing, loss, is, carried, out, by, a, specialist, physician, audiovestibular, physician, or, otorhinolaryngologist, hearing, loss, is, generally, measured, by, playing, generated, or, recorded, sounds, and, determining, whether, the, person, can, hear, them, hearing, sensitivity, varies, according, to, the, frequency, of, sounds, to, take, this, into, account, hearing, sensitivity, can, be, measured, for, a, range, of, frequencies, and, plotted, on, an, audiogram, other, method, for, quantifying, hearing, loss, is, a, hearing, test, using, a, mobile, application, or, hearing, aid, application, which, includes, a, hearing, test, hearing, diagnosis, using, mobile, application, is, similar, to, the, audiometry, procedure, audiograms, obtained, using, mobile, applications, can, be, used, to, adjust, hearing, aid, applications, another, method, for, quantifying, hearing, loss, is, a, speech, in, noise, test, which, gives, an, indication, of, how, well, one, can, understand, speech, in, a, noisy, environment, otoacoustic, emissions, test, is, an, objective, hearing, test, that, may, be, administered, to, toddlers, and, children, too, young, to, cooperate, in, a, conventional, hearing, test, auditory, brainstem, response, testing, is, an, electrophysiological, test, used, to, test, for, hearing, deficits, caused, by, pathology, within, the, ear, the, cochlear, nerve, and, also, within, the, brainstem, a, case, history, usually, a, written, form, with, questionnaire, can, provide, valuable, information, about, the, context, of, the, hearing, loss, and, indicate, what, kind, of, diagnostic, procedures, to, employ, examinations, include, otoscopy, tympanometry, and, differential, testing, with, the, weber, rinne, bing, and, schwabach, tests, in, case, of, infection, or, inflammation, blood, or, other, body, fluids, may, be, submitted, for, laboratory, analysis, mri, and, ct, scans, can, be, useful, to, identify, the, pathology, of, many, causes, of, hearing, loss, hearing, loss, is, categorized, by, severity, type, and, configuration, furthermore, a, hearing, loss, may, exist, in, only, one, ear, unilateral, or, in, both, ears, bilateral, hearing, loss, can, be, temporary, or, permanent, sudden, or, progressive, the, severity, of, a, hearing, loss, is, ranked, according, to, ranges, of, nominal, thresholds, in, which, a, sound, must, be, so, it, can, be, detected, by, an, individual, it, is, measured, in, decibels, of, hearing, loss, or, db, hl, there, are, three, main, types, of, hearing, loss, conductive, hearing, loss, sensorineural, hearing, loss, and, mixed, hearing, loss, an, additional, problem, which, is, increasingly, recognised, is, auditory, processing, disorder, which, is, not, a, hearing, loss, as, such, but, a, difficulty, perceiving, sound, the, shape, of, an, audiogram, shows, the, relative, configuration, of, the, hearing, loss, such, as, a, carhart, notch, for, otosclerosis, noise, notch, for, noise, induced, damage, high, frequency, rolloff, for, presbycusis, or, a, flat, audiogram, for, conductive, hearing, loss, in, conjunction, with, speech, audiometry, it, may, indicate, central, auditory, processing, disorder, or, the, presence, of, a, schwannoma, or, other, tumor, people, with, unilateral, hearing, loss, or, single, sided, deafness, ssd, have, difficulty, in, hearing, conversation, on, their, impaired, side, localizing, sound, and, understanding, speech, in, the, presence, of, background, noise, one, reason, for, the, hearing, problems, these, patients, often, experience, is, due, to, the, head, shadow, effect, idiopathic, sudden, hearing, loss, is, a, condition, where, a, person, as, an, immediate, decrease, in, the, sensitivity, of, their, sensorineural, hearing, that, does, not, have, a, known, cause, this, type, of, loss, is, usually, only, on, one, side, unilateral, and, the, severity, of, the, loss, varies, a, common, threshold, of, a, loss, of, at, least, 30, db, in, three, connected, frequencies, within, 72, hours, is, sometimes, used, however, there, is, no, universal, definition, or, international, consensus, for, diagnosing, idiopathic, sudden, hearing, loss, it, is, estimated, that, half, of, cases, of, hearing, loss, are, preventable, about, 60, of, hearing, loss, in, children, under, the, age, of, 15, can, be, avoided, there, are, a, number, of, effective, preventative, strategies, including, immunization, against, rubella, to, prevent, congenital, rubella, syndrome, immunization, against, h, influenza, and, s, pneumoniae, to, reduce, cases, of, meningitis, and, avoiding, or, protecting, against, excessive, noise, exposure, the, world, health, organization, also, recommends, immunization, against, measles, mumps, and, meningitis, efforts, to, prevent, premature, birth, and, avoidance, of, certain, medication, as, prevention, world, hearing, day, is, a, yearly, event, to, promote, actions, to, prevent, hearing, damage, avoiding, exposure, to, loud, noise, can, help, prevent, noise, induced, hearing, loss, 18, of, adults, exposed, to, loud, noise, at, work, for, five, years, or, more, report, hearing, loss, in, both, ears, as, compared, to, 5, 5, of, adults, who, were, not, exposed, to, loud, noise, at, work, different, programs, exist, for, specific, populations, such, as, school, age, children, adolescents, and, workers, but, the, hpd, without, individual, selection, training, and, fit, testing, does, not, significantly, reduce, the, risk, of, hearing, loss, the, use, of, antioxidants, is, being, studied, for, the, prevention, of, noise, induced, hearing, loss, particularly, for, scenarios, in, which, noise, exposure, cannot, be, reduced, such, as, during, military, operations, noise, is, widely, recognized, as, an, occupational, hazard, in, the, united, states, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, and, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, work, together, to, provide, standards, and, enforcement, on, workplace, noise, levels, the, hierarchy, of, hazard, controls, demonstrates, the, different, levels, of, controls, to, reduce, or, eliminate, exposure, to, noise, and, prevent, hearing, loss, including, engineering, controls, and, personal, protective, equipment, ppe, other, programs, and, initiative, have, been, created, to, prevent, hearing, loss, in, the, workplace, for, example, the, safe, in, sound, award, was, created, to, recognize, organizations, that, can, demonstrate, results, of, successful, noise, control, and, other, interventions, additionally, the, buy, quiet, program, was, created, to, encourage, employers, to, purchase, quieter, machinery, and, tools, by, purchasing, less, noisy, power, tools, like, those, found, on, the, niosh, power, tools, database, and, limiting, exposure, to, ototoxic, chemicals, great, strides, can, be, made, in, preventing, hearing, loss, companies, can, also, provide, personal, hearing, protector, devices, tailored, to, both, the, worker, and, type, of, employment, some, hearing, protectors, universally, block, out, all, noise, and, some, allow, for, certain, noises, to, be, heard, workers, are, more, likely, to, wear, hearing, protector, devices, when, they, are, properly, fitted, often, interventions, to, prevent, noise, induced, hearing, loss, have, many, components, a, 2017, cochrane, review, found, that, stricter, legislation, might, reduce, noise, levels, providing, workers, with, information, on, their, sound, exposure, levels, was, not, shown, to, decrease, exposure, to, noise, ear, protection, if, used, correctly, can, reduce, noise, to, safer, levels, but, often, providing, them, is, not, sufficient, to, prevent, hearing, loss, engineering, noise, out, and, other, solutions, such, as, proper, maintenance, of, equipment, can, lead, to, noise, reduction, but, further, field, studies, on, resulting, noise, exposures, following, such, interventions, are, needed, other, possible, solutions, include, improved, enforcement, of, existing, legislation, and, better, implementation, of, well, designed, prevention, programmes, which, have, not, yet, been, proven, conclusively, to, be, effective, the, conclusion, of, the, cochrane, review, was, that, further, research, could, modify, what, is, now, regarding, the, effectiveness, of, the, evaluated, interventions, the, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, of, the, german, social, accident, insurance, has, created, a, hearing, impairment, calculator, based, on, the, iso, 1999, model, for, studying, threshold, shift, in, relatively, homogeneous, groups, of, people, such, as, workers, with, the, same, type, of, job, the, iso, 1999, model, estimates, how, much, hearing, impairment, in, a, group, can, be, ascribed, to, age, and, noise, exposure, the, result, is, calculated, via, an, algebraic, equation, that, uses, the, a, weighted, sound, exposure, level, how, many, years, the, people, were, exposed, to, this, noise, how, old, the, people, are, and, their, sex, the, model, s, estimations, are, only, useful, for, people, without, hearing, loss, due, to, non, job, related, exposure, and, can, be, used, for, prevention, activities, the, united, states, preventive, services, task, force, recommends, neonatal, hearing, screening, for, all, newborns, as, the, first, three, years, of, life, are, believed, to, be, the, most, important, for, language, development, universal, neonatal, hearing, screenings, have, now, been, widely, implemented, across, the, u, s, with, rates, of, newborn, screening, increasing, from, less, than, 3, in, the, early, 1990s, to, 98, in, 2009, newborns, whose, screening, reveals, a, high, index, of, suspicion, of, hearing, loss, are, referred, for, additional, diagnostic, testing, with, the, goal, of, providing, early, intervention, and, access, to, language, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, advises, that, children, should, have, their, hearing, tested, several, times, throughout, their, schooling, while, the, american, college, of, physicians, indicated, that, there, is, not, enough, evidence, to, determine, the, utility, of, screening, in, adults, over, 50, years, old, who, do, not, have, any, symptoms, the, american, language, speech, pathology, and, hearing, association, recommends, that, adults, should, be, screened, at, least, every, decade, through, age, 50, and, at, three, year, intervals, thereafter, to, minimize, the, detrimental, effects, of, the, untreated, condition, on, quality, of, life, for, the, same, reason, the, us, office, of, disease, prevention, and, health, promotion, included, as, one, of, healthy, people, 2020, objectives, to, increase, the, proportion, of, persons, who, have, had, a, hearing, examination, management, depends, on, the, specific, cause, if, known, as, well, as, the, extent, type, and, configuration, of, the, hearing, loss, sudden, hearing, loss, due, to, an, underlying, nerve, problem, may, be, treated, with, corticosteroids, most, hearing, loss, that, result, from, age, and, noise, is, progressive, and, irreversible, and, there, are, currently, no, approved, or, recommended, treatments, a, few, specific, kinds, of, hearing, loss, are, amenable, to, surgical, treatment, in, other, cases, treatment, is, addressed, to, underlying, pathologies, but, any, hearing, loss, incurred, may, be, permanent, some, management, options, include, hearing, aids, cochlear, implants, middle, ear, implants, assistive, technology, and, closed, captioning, in, movie, theaters, a, hearing, impaired, hi, audio, track, may, be, available, via, headphones, to, better, hear, dialog, this, choice, depends, on, the, level, of, hearing, loss, type, of, hearing, loss, and, personal, preference, hearing, aid, applications, are, one, of, the, options, for, hearing, loss, management, for, people, with, bilateral, hearing, loss, it, is, not, clear, if, bilateral, hearing, aids, hearing, aids, in, both, ears, are, better, than, a, unilateral, hearing, aid, hearing, aid, in, one, ear, for, people, with, idiopathic, sudden, hearing, loss, different, treatment, approaches, have, been, suggested, that, are, usually, based, on, the, suspected, cause, of, the, sudden, hearing, loss, treatment, approaches, may, include, corticosteroid, medications, rheological, drugs, vasodilators, anesthetics, and, other, medications, chosen, based, on, the, suspected, underlying, pathology, that, caused, the, sudden, hearing, loss, the, evidence, supporting, most, treatment, options, for, idiopathic, sudden, hearing, loss, is, very, weak, and, adverse, effects, of, these, different, medications, is, a, consideration, when, deciding, on, a, treatment, approach, globally, hearing, loss, affects, about, 10, of, the, population, to, some, degree, it, caused, moderate, to, severe, disability, in, 124, 2, million, people, as, of, 2004, 107, 9, million, of, whom, are, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, of, these, 65, million, acquired, the, condition, during, childhood, at, birth, 3, per, 1000, in, developed, countries, and, more, than, 6, per, 1000, in, developing, countries, have, hearing, problems, hearing, loss, increases, with, age, in, those, between, 20, and, 35, rates, of, hearing, loss, are, 3, while, in, those, 44, to, 55, it, is, 11, and, in, those, 65, to, 85, it, is, 43, a, 2017, report, by, the, world, health, organization, estimated, the, costs, of, unaddressed, hearing, loss, and, the, cost, effectiveness, of, interventions, for, the, health, care, sector, for, the, education, sector, and, as, broad, societal, costs, globally, the, annual, cost, of, unaddressed, hearing, loss, was, estimated, to, be, in, the, range, of, 750, 790, billion, international, dollars, the, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, developed, the, iso, 1999, standards, for, the, estimation, of, hearing, thresholds, and, noise, induced, hearing, impairment, they, used, data, from, two, noise, and, hearing, study, databases, one, presented, by, burns, and, robinson, hearing, and, noise, in, industry, her, majesty, s, stationery, office, london, 1970, and, by, passchier, vermeer, 1968, as, race, are, some, of, the, factors, that, can, affect, the, expected, distribution, of, pure, tone, hearing, thresholds, several, other, national, or, regional, datasets, exist, from, sweden, norway, south, korea, the, united, states, and, spain, in, the, united, states, hearing, is, one, of, the, health, outcomes, measure, by, the, national, health, and, nutrition, examination, survey, nhanes, a, survey, research, program, conducted, by, the, national, center, for, health, statistics, it, examines, health, and, nutritional, status, of, adults, and, children, in, the, united, states, data, from, the, united, states, in, 2011, 2012, found, that, rates, of, hearing, loss, has, declined, among, adults, aged, 20, to, 69, years, when, compared, with, the, results, from, an, earlier, time, period, 1999, 2004, it, also, found, that, adult, hearing, loss, is, associated, with, increasing, age, sex, ethnicity, educational, level, and, noise, exposure, nearly, one, in, four, adults, had, audiometric, results, suggesting, noise, induced, hearing, loss, almost, one, in, four, adults, who, reported, excellent, or, good, hearing, had, a, similar, pattern, 5, 5, on, both, sides, and, 18, on, one, side, among, people, who, reported, exposure, to, loud, noise, at, work, almost, one, third, had, such, changes, people, with, extreme, hearing, loss, may, communicate, through, sign, languages, sign, languages, convey, meaning, through, manual, communication, and, body, language, instead, of, acoustically, conveyed, sound, patterns, this, involves, the, simultaneous, combination, of, hand, shapes, orientation, and, movement, of, the, hands, arms, or, body, and, facial, expressions, to, express, a, speaker, s, thoughts, sign, languages, are, based, on, the, idea, that, vision, is, the, most, useful, tool, a, deaf, person, has, to, communicate, and, receive, information, deaf, culture, refers, to, a, tight, knit, cultural, group, of, people, whose, primary, language, is, signed, and, who, practice, social, and, cultural, norms, which, are, distinct, from, those, of, the, surrounding, hearing, community, this, community, does, not, automatically, include, all, those, who, are, clinically, or, legally, deaf, nor, does, it, exclude, every, hearing, person, according, to, baker, and, padden, it, includes, any, person, or, persons, who, identifies, him, herself, as, a, member, of, the, deaf, community, and, other, members, accept, that, person, as, a, part, of, the, community, an, example, being, children, of, deaf, adults, with, normal, hearing, ability, it, includes, the, set, of, social, beliefs, behaviors, art, literary, traditions, history, values, and, shared, institutions, of, communities, that, are, influenced, by, deafness, and, which, use, sign, languages, as, the, main, means, of, communication, members, of, the, deaf, community, tend, to, view, deafness, as, a, difference, in, human, experience, rather, than, a, disability, or, disease, when, used, as, a, cultural, label, especially, within, the, culture, the, word, deaf, is, often, written, with, a, capital, d, and, referred, to, as, big, d, deaf, in, speech, and, sign, when, used, as, a, label, for, the, audiological, condition, it, is, written, with, a, lower, case, d, there, also, multiple, educational, institutions, for, both, deaf, and, deaf, people, that, usually, use, sign, language, as, the, main, language, of, instruction, famous, institutions, include, gallaudet, university, and, the, national, technical, institute, for, the, deaf, in, the, us, and, the, national, university, corporation, of, tsukuba, university, of, technology, in, japan, a, 2005, study, achieved, successful, regrowth, of, cochlea, cells, in, guinea, pigs, however, the, regrowth, of, cochlear, hair, cells, does, not, imply, the, restoration, of, hearing, sensitivity, as, the, sensory, cells, may, or, may, not, make, connections, with, neurons, that, carry, the, signals, from, hair, cells, to, the, brain, a, 2008, study, has, shown, that, gene, therapy, targeting, atoh1, can, cause, hair, cell, growth, and, attract, neuronal, processes, in, embryonic, mice, some, hope, that, a, similar, treatment, will, one, day, ameliorate, hearing, loss, in, humans, recent, research, reported, in, 2012, achieved, growth, of, cochlear, nerve, cells, resulting, in, hearing, improvements, in, gerbils, using, stem, cells, also, reported, in, 2013, was, regrowth, of, hair, cells, in, deaf, adult, mice, using, a, drug, intervention, resulting, in, hearing, improvement, the, hearing, health, foundation, in, the, us, has, embarked, on, a, project, called, the, hearing, restoration, project, also, action, on, hearing, loss, in, the, uk, is, also, aiming, to, restore, hearing, researchers, reported, in, 2015, that, genetically, deaf, mice, which, were, treated, with, tmc1, gene, therapy, recovered, some, of, their, hearing, in, 2017, additional, studies, were, performed, to, treat, usher, syndrome, and, here, a, recombinant, adeno, associated, virus, seemed, to, outperform, the, older, vectors, besides, research, studies, seeking, to, improve, hearing, such, as, the, ones, listed, above, research, studies, on, the, deaf, have, also, been, carried, out, in, order, to, understand, more, about, audition, pijil, and, shwarz, 2005, conducted, their, study, on, the, deaf, who, lost, their, hearing, later, in, life, and, hence, used, cochlear, implants, to, hear, they, discovered, further, evidence, for, rate, coding, of, pitch, a, system, that, codes, for, information, for, frequencies, by, the, rate, that, neurons, fire, in, the, auditory, system, especially, for, lower, frequencies, as, they, are, coded, by, the, frequencies, that, neurons, fire, from, the, basilar, membrane, in, a, synchronous, manner, their, results, showed, that, the, subjects, could, identify, different, pitches, that, were, proportional, to, the, frequency, stimulated, by, a, single, electrode, the, lower, frequencies, were, detected, when, the, basilar, membrane, was, stimulated, providing, even, further, evidence, for, rate, coding
