the, olive, botanical, name, olea, europaea, meaning, european, olive, is, a, species, of, small, tree, or, shrub, in, the, family, oleaceae, found, traditionally, in, the, mediterranean, basin, with, wild, subspecies, found, further, afield, in, africa, and, western, asia, when, in, shrub, form, it, is, known, as, olea, europaea, montra, dwarf, olive, or, little, olive, the, species, is, cultivated, in, all, the, countries, of, the, mediterranean, as, well, as, in, australia, new, zealand, north, and, south, america, and, south, africa, it, is, the, type, species, for, its, genus, olea, the, tree, and, its, fruit, give, their, name, to, the, oleaceae, plant, family, which, also, includes, species, such, as, lilac, jasmine, forsythia, and, the, true, ash, tree, the, olive, s, fruit, also, called, an, olive, is, of, major, agricultural, importance, in, the, mediterranean, region, as, the, source, of, olive, oil, it, is, one, of, the, core, ingredients, in, middle, eastern, and, mediterranean, cuisines, thousands, of, cultivars, of, the, olive, tree, are, known, olive, cultivars, may, be, used, primarily, for, oil, eating, or, both, olives, cultivated, for, consumption, are, generally, referred, to, as, table, olives, about, 80, of, all, harvested, olives, are, turned, into, oil, while, about, 20, are, used, as, table, olives, the, word, olive, derives, from, latin, l, va, olive, fruit, olive, tree, possibly, through, etruscan, eleiva, from, the, archaic, proto, greek, form, ela, wa, classic, greek, ela, a, olive, fruit, olive, tree, the, word, oil, originally, meant, olive, oil, from, l, um, laion, olive, oil, the, word, for, oil, in, multiple, other, languages, also, ultimately, derives, from, the, name, of, this, tree, and, its, fruit, the, oldest, attested, forms, of, the, greek, words, are, mycenaean, e, ra, wa, and, e, ra, wo, or, e, rai, wo, written, in, the, linear, b, syllabic, script, the, olive, tree, olea, europaea, is, an, evergreen, tree, or, shrub, native, to, mediterranean, europe, asia, and, africa, it, is, short, and, squat, and, rarely, exceeds, 8, 15, m, 25, 50, ft, in, height, pisciottana, a, unique, variety, comprising, 40, 000, trees, found, only, in, the, area, around, pisciotta, in, the, campania, region, of, southern, italy, often, exceeds, this, with, correspondingly, large, trunk, diameters, the, silvery, green, leaves, are, oblong, measuring, 4, 10, cm, 1, 1, 2, 4, in, long, and, 1, 3, cm, 3, 8, 1, 3, 16, in, wide, the, trunk, is, typically, gnarled, and, twisted, the, small, white, feathery, flowers, with, ten, cleft, calyx, and, corolla, two, stamens, and, bifid, stigma, are, borne, generally, on, the, previous, year, s, wood, in, racemes, springing, from, the, axils, of, the, leaves, the, fruit, is, a, small, drupe, 1, 2, 5, cm, 3, 8, 1, in, long, when, ripe, thinner, fleshed, and, smaller, in, wild, plants, than, in, orchard, cultivars, olives, are, harvested, in, the, green, to, purple, stage, o, europaea, contains, a, pyrena, commonly, referred, to, in, american, english, as, a, pit, and, in, british, english, as, a, stone, the, six, natural, subspecies, of, olea, europaea, are, distributed, over, a, wide, range, the, subspecies, europaea, is, divided, into, two, varieties, the, europaea, which, was, formerly, named, olea, sativa, with, the, seedlings, called, olivasters, and, silvestris, which, corresponds, to, the, old, wildly, growing, mediterranean, species, o, oleaster, with, the, seedlings, called, oleasters, the, sylvestris, is, characterized, by, a, smaller, shrubby, tree, that, produces, smaller, fruits, and, leaves, the, subspecies, o, e, cerasiformis, is, tetraploid, and, o, e, maroccana, is, hexaploid, wild, growing, forms, of, the, olive, are, sometimes, treated, as, the, species, olea, oleaster, or, oleaster, the, trees, referred, to, as, white, and, black, olives, in, southeast, asia, are, not, actually, olives, but, species, of, canarium, hundreds, of, cultivars, of, the, olive, tree, are, known, an, olive, s, cultivar, has, a, significant, impact, on, its, colour, size, shape, and, growth, characteristics, as, well, as, the, qualities, of, olive, oil, olive, cultivars, may, be, used, primarily, for, oil, eating, or, both, olives, cultivated, for, consumption, are, generally, referred, to, as, table, olives, since, many, olive, cultivars, are, self, sterile, or, nearly, so, they, are, generally, planted, in, pairs, with, a, single, primary, cultivar, and, a, secondary, cultivar, selected, for, its, ability, to, fertilize, the, primary, one, in, recent, times, efforts, have, been, directed, at, producing, hybrid, cultivars, with, qualities, useful, to, farmers, such, as, resistance, to, disease, quick, growth, and, larger, or, more, consistent, crops, fossil, evidence, indicates, the, olive, tree, had, its, origins, 20, 40, million, years, ago, in, the, oligocene, in, what, now, corresponds, to, italy, and, the, eastern, mediterranean, basin, around, 100, 000, years, ago, olives, were, used, by, humans, in, africa, on, the, atlantic, coast, of, morocco, for, fuel, and, most, probably, for, consumption, wild, olive, trees, or, oleasters, have, been, collected, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, since, 19, 000, bp, the, genome, of, cultivated, olives, reflects, their, origin, from, oleaster, populations, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, the, olive, plant, was, first, cultivated, some, 7, 000, years, ago, in, mediterranean, regions, for, thousands, of, years, olives, were, grown, primarily, for, lamp, oil, with, little, regard, for, culinary, flavor, its, origin, can, be, traced, to, the, levant, based, on, written, tablets, olive, pits, and, wood, fragments, found, in, ancient, tombs, as, far, back, as, 3000, bc, olives, were, grown, commercially, in, crete, and, may, have, been, the, source, of, the, wealth, of, the, minoan, civilization, the, ancestry, of, the, cultivated, olive, is, unknown, fossil, olea, pollen, has, been, found, in, macedonia, and, other, places, around, the, mediterranean, indicating, that, this, genus, is, an, original, element, of, the, mediterranean, flora, fossilized, leaves, of, olea, were, found, in, the, palaeosols, of, the, volcanic, greek, island, of, santorini, and, dated, to, about, 37, 000, bp, imprints, of, larvae, of, olive, whitefly, aleurobus, olivinus, were, found, on, the, leaves, the, same, insect, is, commonly, found, today, on, olive, leaves, showing, that, the, plant, animal, co, evolutionary, relations, have, not, changed, since, that, time, other, leaves, found, on, the, same, island, are, dated, back, to, 60, 000, bp, making, them, the, oldest, known, olives, from, the, mediterranean, olives, are, not, native, to, the, americas, spanish, colonists, brought, the, olive, to, the, new, world, where, its, cultivation, prospered, in, present, day, peru, chile, uruguay, and, argentina, the, first, seedlings, from, spain, were, planted, in, lima, by, antonio, de, rivera, in, 1560, olive, tree, cultivation, quickly, spread, along, the, valleys, of, south, america, s, dry, pacific, coast, where, the, climate, was, similar, to, the, mediterranean, spanish, missionaries, established, the, tree, in, the, 18th, century, in, california, it, was, first, cultivated, at, mission, san, diego, de, alcal, in, 1769, or, later, around, 1795, orchards, were, started, at, other, missions, but, in, 1838, an, inspection, found, only, two, olive, orchards, in, california, cultivation, for, oil, gradually, became, a, highly, successful, commercial, venture, from, the, 1860s, onward, in, japan, the, first, successful, planting, of, olive, trees, happened, in, 1908, on, shodo, island, which, became, the, cradle, of, olive, cultivation, in, japan, in, 2016, olive, oil, production, started, in, india, with, olive, saplings, planted, in, rajasthan, s, thar, desert, favoured, by, climate, warming, several, small, scale, olive, production, farms, have, also, been, established, at, fairly, high, latitudes, in, europe, and, north, america, since, the, early, 21st, century, there, were, an, estimated, 865, million, olive, trees, in, the, world, as, of, 2005, and, the, vast, majority, of, these, were, found, in, mediterranean, countries, with, traditionally, marginal, areas, accounting, for, no, more, than, 25, of, olive, planted, area, and, 10, of, oil, production, olives, are, thought, to, have, been, domesticated, in, the, third, millennium, bc, at, the, latest, at, which, point, they, along, with, grain, and, grapes, became, part, of, colin, renfrew, s, mediterranean, triad, of, staple, crops, that, fueled, the, emergence, of, more, complex, societies, olives, and, especially, perfumed, olive, oil, became, a, major, export, product, during, the, minoan, and, mycenaean, periods, dutch, archaeologist, jorrit, kelder, proposed, that, the, mycenaeans, sent, shipments, of, olive, oil, probably, alongside, live, olive, branches, to, the, court, of, the, egyptian, pharaoh, akhenaten, as, a, diplomatic, gift, in, egypt, these, imported, olive, branches, may, have, acquired, ritual, meanings, as, they, are, depicted, as, offerings, on, the, wall, of, the, aten, temple, and, were, used, in, wreaths, for, the, burial, of, tutankhamun, it, is, likely, that, as, well, as, being, used, for, culinary, purposes, olive, oil, was, also, used, to, various, other, ends, including, as, a, perfume, the, ancient, greeks, smeared, olive, oil, on, their, bodies, and, hair, as, a, matter, of, grooming, and, good, health, olive, oil, was, used, to, anoint, kings, and, athletes, in, ancient, greece, it, was, burnt, in, the, sacred, lamps, of, temples, and, was, the, eternal, flame, of, the, original, olympic, games, victors, in, these, games, were, crowned, with, its, leaves, in, homer, s, odyssey, odysseus, crawls, beneath, two, shoots, of, olive, that, grow, from, a, single, stock, and, in, the, iliad, xvii, 53ff, there, is, a, metaphoric, description, of, a, lone, olive, tree, in, the, mountains, by, a, spring, the, greeks, observed, that, the, olive, rarely, thrives, at, a, distance, from, the, sea, which, in, greece, invariably, means, up, mountain, slopes, greek, myth, attributed, to, the, primordial, culture, hero, aristaeus, the, understanding, of, olive, husbandry, along, with, cheese, making, and, bee, keeping, olive, was, one, of, the, woods, used, to, fashion, the, most, primitive, greek, cult, figures, called, xoana, referring, to, their, wooden, material, they, were, reverently, preserved, for, centuries, it, was, purely, a, matter, of, local, pride, that, the, athenians, claimed, that, the, olive, grew, first, in, athens, in, an, archaic, athenian, foundation, myth, athena, won, the, patronage, of, attica, from, poseidon, with, the, gift, of, the, olive, according, to, the, fourth, century, bc, father, of, botany, theophrastus, olive, trees, ordinarily, attained, an, age, around, 200, years, he, mentions, that, the, very, olive, tree, of, athena, still, grew, on, the, acropolis, it, was, still, to, be, seen, there, in, the, second, century, ad, and, when, pausanias, was, shown, it, c, 170, ad, he, reported, legend, also, says, that, when, the, persians, fired, athens, the, olive, was, burnt, down, but, on, the, very, day, it, was, burnt, it, grew, again, to, the, height, of, two, cubits, indeed, olive, suckers, sprout, readily, from, the, stump, and, the, great, age, of, some, existing, olive, trees, shows, that, it, was, possible, that, the, olive, tree, of, the, acropolis, dated, to, the, bronze, age, the, olive, was, sacred, to, athena, and, appeared, on, the, athenian, coinage, according, to, another, myth, elaea, was, an, accomplished, athlete, killed, by, her, fellow, athletes, who, had, grown, envious, of, her, but, athena, and, gaia, turned, her, into, an, olive, tree, as, reward, theophrastus, in, on, the, causes, of, plants, does, not, give, as, systematic, and, detailed, an, account, of, olive, husbandry, as, he, does, of, the, vine, but, he, makes, clear, in, 1, 16, 10, that, the, cultivated, olive, must, be, vegetatively, propagated, indeed, the, pits, give, rise, to, thorny, wild, type, olives, spread, far, and, wide, by, birds, theophrastus, reports, how, the, bearing, olive, can, be, grafted, on, the, wild, olive, for, which, the, greeks, had, a, separate, name, kotinos, in, his, enquiry, into, plants, 2, 1, 2, 4, he, states, that, the, olive, can, be, propagated, from, a, piece, of, the, trunk, the, root, a, twig, or, a, stake, according, to, pliny, the, elder, a, vine, a, fig, tree, and, an, olive, tree, grew, in, the, middle, of, the, roman, forum, the, olive, was, planted, to, provide, shade, the, garden, was, recreated, in, the, 20th, century, the, roman, poet, horace, mentions, it, in, reference, to, his, own, diet, which, he, describes, as, very, simple, as, for, me, olives, endives, and, smooth, mallows, provide, sustenance, lord, monboddo, comments, on, the, olive, in, 1779, as, one, of, the, foods, preferred, by, the, ancients, and, as, one, of, the, most, perfect, foods, vitruvius, describes, of, the, use, of, charred, olive, wood, in, tying, together, walls, and, foundations, in, his, de, architectura, the, thickness, of, the, wall, should, in, my, opinion, be, such, that, armed, men, meeting, on, top, of, it, may, pass, one, another, without, interference, in, the, thickness, there, should, be, set, a, very, close, succession, of, ties, made, of, charred, olive, wood, binding, the, two, faces, of, the, wall, together, like, pins, to, give, it, lasting, endurance, for, that, is, a, material, which, neither, decay, nor, the, weather, nor, time, can, harm, but, even, though, buried, in, the, earth, or, set, in, the, water, it, keeps, sound, and, useful, forever, and, so, not, only, city, walls, but, substructures, in, general, and, all, walls, that, require, a, thickness, like, that, of, a, city, wall, will, be, long, in, falling, to, decay, if, tied, in, this, manner, olives, were, one, of, the, main, elements, in, ancient, israelite, cuisine, olive, oil, was, used, for, not, only, food, and, cooking, but, also, lighting, sacrificial, offerings, ointment, and, anointment, for, priestly, or, royal, office, the, olive, tree, is, one, of, the, first, plants, mentioned, in, the, hebrew, bible, the, christian, old, testament, and, one, of, the, most, significant, an, olive, branch, or, leaf, depending, on, translation, was, brought, back, to, noah, by, a, dove, to, demonstrate, that, the, flood, was, over, book, of, genesis, 8, 11, the, olive, is, listed, in, deuteronomy, 8, 8, as, one, of, the, seven, species, that, are, noteworthy, products, of, the, land, of, israel, according, to, the, halakha, the, jewish, law, mandatory, for, all, jews, the, olive, is, one, of, the, seven, species, that, require, the, recitation, of, me, eyn, shalosh, after, they, are, consumed, olive, oil, is, also, the, most, recommended, and, best, possible, oil, for, the, lighting, of, the, shabbat, candles, the, mount, of, olives, east, of, jerusalem, is, mentioned, several, times, in, the, new, testament, the, allegory, of, the, olive, tree, in, st, paul, s, epistle, to, the, romans, refers, to, the, scattering, and, gathering, of, israel, it, compares, the, israelites, to, a, tame, olive, tree, and, the, gentiles, to, a, wild, olive, branch, the, olive, tree, itself, as, well, as, olive, oil, and, olives, play, an, important, role, in, the, bible, the, olive, tree, and, olive, oil, are, mentioned, seven, times, in, the, quran, and, the, olive, is, praised, as, a, precious, fruit, olive, tree, and, olive, oil, health, benefits, have, been, propounded, in, prophetic, medicine, muhammad, is, reported, to, have, said, take, oil, of, olive, and, massage, with, it, it, is, a, blessed, tree, sunan, al, darimi, 69, 103, olives, are, substitutes, for, dates, if, not, available, during, ramadan, fasting, and, olive, tree, leaves, are, used, as, incense, in, some, muslim, mediterranean, countries, in, palestine, the, olive, tree, and, plant, carry, the, symbolic, connotations, of, resilience, health, ancestral, ties, and, community, researchers, have, found, that, the, olive, tree, is, tied, into, the, palestinians, sutra, a, wana, and, sumud, the, tree, is, a, means, of, survival, and, security, represents, their, bond, to, their, land, community, and, animals, olive, trees, also, serve, as, a, symbol, of, their, identities, which, include, their, physical, and, emotional, aspects, and, their, socio, cultural, values, palestinian, people, view, the, olive, trees, as, the, first, witnesses, that, palestine, is, their, homeland, the, harvest, season, is, referred, to, as, palestine, s, wedding, and, is, considered, a, national, holiday, when, schools, close, for, two, days, so, that, pupils, and, teachers, can, join, in, the, harvest, this, holiday, allows, community, and, family, members, to, gather, and, serves, as, a, ritual, that, encompasses, their, values, surrounding, family, labour, community, and, aid, for, other, members, of, the, community, that, do, not, possess, land, this, is, practised, through, the, tradition, of, leaving, fruit, on, a, tree, during, the, harvest, so, that, those, who, do, not, have, land, and, are, unable, to, take, part, in, the, harvest, can, still, reap, the, benefits, the, great, seal, of, the, united, states, first, used, in, 1782, depicts, an, eagle, clutching, an, olive, branch, in, one, of, its, talons, indicating, the, power, of, peace, the, flag, of, the, united, nations, adopted, in, 1946, is, a, world, map, with, two, olive, branches, the, olive, tree, olea, europaea, has, been, cultivated, for, olive, oil, fine, wood, olive, leaf, ornamental, reasons, and, the, olive, fruit, about, 80, of, all, harvested, olives, are, turned, into, oil, while, about, 20, are, used, as, table, olives, the, olive, is, one, of, the, trinity, or, triad, of, basic, ingredients, in, mediterranean, cuisine, the, other, two, being, wheat, for, bread, pasta, and, couscous, and, the, grape, for, wine, olive, oil, is, a, liquid, fat, obtained, from, olives, produced, by, pressing, whole, olives, and, extracting, the, oil, it, is, commonly, used, in, cooking, for, frying, foods, or, as, a, salad, dressing, it, is, also, used, in, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and, soaps, and, as, a, fuel, for, traditional, oil, lamps, and, has, additional, uses, in, some, religions, spain, accounts, for, almost, half, of, global, olive, oil, production, other, major, producers, are, portugal, italy, tunisia, greece, and, turkey, per, capita, consumption, is, highest, in, greece, followed, by, italy, and, spain, the, composition, of, olive, oil, varies, with, the, cultivar, elevation, time, of, harvest, and, extraction, process, it, consists, mainly, of, oleic, acid, up, to, 83, with, smaller, amounts, of, other, fatty, acids, including, linoleic, acid, up, to, 21, and, palmitic, acid, up, to, 20, extra, virgin, olive, oil, is, required, to, have, no, more, than, 0, 8, free, acidity, and, fruity, flavor, characteristics, table, olives, are, classified, by, the, international, olive, council, ioc, into, three, groups, according, to, the, degree, of, ripeness, achieved, before, harvesting, raw, or, fresh, olives, are, naturally, very, bitter, to, make, them, palatable, olives, must, be, cured, and, fermented, thereby, removing, oleuropein, a, bitter, phenolic, compound, that, can, reach, levels, of, 14, of, dry, matter, in, young, olives, in, addition, to, oleuropein, other, phenolic, compounds, render, freshly, picked, olives, unpalatable, and, must, also, be, removed, or, lowered, in, quantity, through, curing, and, fermentation, generally, speaking, phenolics, reach, their, peak, in, young, fruit, and, are, converted, as, the, fruit, matures, once, ripening, occurs, the, levels, of, phenolics, sharply, decline, through, their, conversion, to, other, organic, products, which, render, some, cultivars, edible, immediately, one, example, of, an, edible, olive, native, to, the, island, of, thasos, is, the, throubes, black, olive, which, becomes, edible, when, allowed, to, ripen, in, the, sun, shrivel, and, fall, from, the, tree, the, curing, process, may, take, from, a, few, days, with, lye, to, a, few, months, with, brine, or, salt, packing, with, the, exception, of, california, style, and, salt, cured, olives, all, methods, of, curing, involve, a, major, fermentation, involving, bacteria, and, yeast, that, is, of, equal, importance, to, the, final, table, olive, product, traditional, cures, using, the, natural, microflora, on, the, fruit, to, induce, fermentation, lead, to, two, important, outcomes, the, leaching, out, and, breakdown, of, oleuropein, and, other, unpalatable, phenolic, compounds, and, the, generation, of, favourable, metabolites, from, bacteria, and, yeast, such, as, organic, acids, probiotics, glycerol, and, esters, which, affect, the, sensory, properties, of, the, final, table, olives, mixed, bacterial, yeast, olive, fermentations, may, have, probiotic, qualities, lactic, acid, is, the, most, important, metabolite, as, it, lowers, the, ph, acting, as, a, natural, preservative, against, the, growth, of, unwanted, pathogenic, species, the, result, is, table, olives, which, can, be, stored, without, refrigeration, fermentations, dominated, by, lactic, acid, bacteria, are, therefore, the, most, suitable, method, of, curing, olives, yeast, dominated, fermentations, produce, a, different, suite, of, metabolites, which, provide, poorer, preservation, so, they, are, corrected, with, an, acid, such, as, citric, acid, in, the, final, processing, stage, to, provide, microbial, stability, the, many, types, of, preparations, for, table, olives, depend, on, local, tastes, and, traditions, the, most, important, commercial, examples, are, listed, below, applied, to, green, semiripe, or, ripe, olives, olives, are, soaked, in, salt, water, for, 24, 48, hours, then, they, are, slightly, crushed, with, a, rock, to, hasten, the, fermentation, process, the, olives, are, stored, for, a, period, of, up, to, a, year, in, a, container, with, salt, water, lemon, juice, lemon, peels, laurel, and, olive, leaves, and, rosemary, some, recipes, may, contain, white, vinegar, or, olive, oil, most, commonly, applied, to, green, olive, preparation, around, 60, of, all, the, world, s, table, olives, are, produced, with, this, method, olives, are, soaked, in, lye, dilute, naoh, 2, 4, for, 8, 10, hours, to, hydrolyse, the, oleuropein, they, are, usually, considered, treated, when, the, lye, has, penetrated, two, thirds, of, the, way, into, the, fruit, they, are, then, washed, once, or, several, times, in, water, to, remove, the, caustic, solution, and, transferred, to, fermenting, vessels, full, of, brine, at, typical, concentrations, of, 8, 12, nacl, the, brine, is, changed, on, a, regular, basis, to, help, remove, the, phenolic, compounds, fermentation, is, carried, out, by, the, natural, microbiota, present, on, the, olives, that, survive, the, lye, treatment, process, many, organisms, are, involved, usually, reflecting, the, local, conditions, or, terroir, of, the, olives, during, a, typical, fermentation, gram, negative, enterobacteria, flourish, in, small, numbers, at, first, but, are, rapidly, outgrown, by, lactic, acid, bacteria, species, such, as, leuconostoc, mesenteroides, lactobacillus, plantarum, lactobacillus, brevis, and, pediococcus, damnosus, these, bacteria, produce, lactic, acid, to, help, lower, the, ph, of, the, brine, and, therefore, stabilize, the, product, against, unwanted, pathogenic, species, a, diversity, of, yeasts, then, accumulate, in, sufficient, numbers, to, help, complete, the, fermentation, alongside, the, lactic, acid, bacteria, yeasts, commonly, mentioned, include, the, teleomorphs, pichia, anomala, pichia, membranifaciens, debaryomyces, hansenii, and, kluyveromyces, marxianus, once, fermented, the, olives, are, placed, in, fresh, brine, and, acid, corrected, to, be, ready, for, market, applied, to, green, semiripe, and, ripe, olives, they, are, almost, identical, to, the, spanish, type, fermentation, process, but, the, lye, treatment, process, is, skipped, and, the, olives, are, placed, directly, in, fermentation, vessels, full, of, brine, 8, 12, nacl, the, brine, is, changed, on, a, regular, basis, to, help, remove, the, phenolic, compounds, as, the, caustic, treatment, is, avoided, lactic, acid, bacteria, are, only, present, in, similar, numbers, to, yeast, and, appear, to, be, outdone, by, the, abundant, yeasts, found, on, untreated, olives, as, very, little, acid, is, produced, by, the, yeast, fermentation, lactic, acetic, or, citric, acid, is, often, added, to, the, fermentation, stage, to, stabilize, the, process, applied, to, green, semi, ripe, or, ripe, olives, they, are, soaked, in, lye, typically, for, longer, periods, than, spanish, style, e, g, 10, 72, hours, until, the, solution, has, penetrated, three, quarters, of, the, way, into, the, fruit, they, are, then, washed, and, immediately, brined, and, acid, corrected, with, citric, acid, to, achieve, microbial, stability, fermentation, still, occurs, carried, out, by, acidogenic, yeast, and, bacteria, but, is, more, subdued, than, other, methods, the, brine, is, changed, on, a, regular, basis, to, help, remove, the, phenolic, compounds, and, a, series, of, progressively, stronger, concentrations, of, salt, are, added, until, the, product, is, fully, stabilized, and, ready, to, be, eaten, applied, to, green, semi, ripe, or, ripe, olives, these, are, soaked, in, water, or, weak, brine, and, this, solution, is, changed, on, a, daily, basis, for, 10, 14, days, the, oleuropein, is, naturally, dissolved, and, leached, into, the, water, and, removed, during, a, continual, soak, wash, cycle, fermentation, takes, place, during, the, water, treatment, stage, and, involves, a, mixed, yeast, bacteria, ecosystem, sometimes, the, olives, are, lightly, cracked, with, a, blunt, instrument, to, trigger, fermentation, and, speed, up, the, fermentation, process, once, debittered, the, olives, are, brined, to, concentrations, of, 8, 12, nacl, and, acid, corrected, and, are, then, ready, to, eat, applied, only, to, ripe, olives, since, it, is, only, a, light, fermentation, they, are, usually, produced, in, morocco, turkey, and, other, eastern, mediterranean, countries, once, picked, the, olives, are, vigorously, washed, and, packed, in, alternating, layers, with, salt, the, high, concentration, of, salt, draws, the, moisture, out, of, olives, dehydrating, and, shriveling, them, until, they, look, somewhat, analogous, to, a, raisin, once, packed, in, salt, fermentation, is, minimal, and, only, initiated, by, the, most, halophilic, yeast, species, such, as, debaryomyces, hansenii, once, cured, they, are, sold, in, their, natural, state, without, any, additives, so, called, oil, cured, olives, are, cured, in, salt, and, then, soaked, in, oil, applied, to, green, and, semi, ripe, olives, they, are, placed, in, lye, and, soaked, upon, their, removal, they, are, washed, in, water, injected, with, compressed, air, without, fermentation, this, process, is, repeated, several, times, until, both, oxygen, and, lye, have, soaked, through, to, the, pit, the, repeated, saturated, exposure, to, air, oxidises, the, skin, and, flesh, of, the, fruit, turning, it, black, in, an, artificial, process, that, mimics, natural, ripening, once, fully, oxidised, or, blackened, they, are, brined, and, acid, corrected, and, are, then, ready, for, eating, olive, wood, is, very, hard, and, tough, and, is, prized, for, its, durability, colour, high, combustion, temperature, and, interesting, grain, patterns, because, of, the, commercial, importance, of, the, fruit, slow, growth, and, relatively, small, size, of, the, tree, olive, wood, and, its, products, are, relatively, expensive, common, uses, of, olive, wood, include, kitchen, utensils, carved, wooden, bowls, cutting, boards, fine, furniture, and, decorative, items, the, yellow, or, light, greenish, brown, wood, is, often, finely, veined, with, a, darker, tint, being, very, hard, and, close, grained, it, is, valued, by, woodworkers, in, modern, landscape, design, olive, trees, are, frequently, used, as, ornamental, features, for, their, distinctively, gnarled, trunks, and, evergreen, silvery, gray, foliage, the, earliest, evidence, for, the, domestication, of, olives, comes, from, the, chalcolithic, period, archaeological, site, of, teleilat, el, ghassul, in, modern, jordan, farmers, in, ancient, times, believed, that, olive, trees, would, not, grow, well, if, planted, more, than, a, certain, distance, from, the, sea, theophrastus, gives, 300, stadia, 55, 6, km, or, 34, 5, mi, as, the, limit, modern, experience, does, not, always, confirm, this, and, though, showing, a, preference, for, the, coast, they, have, long, been, grown, further, inland, in, some, areas, with, suitable, climates, particularly, in, the, southwestern, mediterranean, iberia, and, northwest, africa, where, winters, are, mild, an, article, on, olive, tree, cultivation, in, spain, is, brought, down, in, ibn, al, awwam, s, 12th, century, agricultural, work, book, on, agriculture, olives, are, cultivated, in, many, regions, of, the, world, with, mediterranean, climates, such, as, south, africa, chile, peru, pakistan, australia, oregon, and, california, and, in, areas, with, temperate, climates, such, as, new, zealand, they, are, also, grown, in, the, c, rdoba, province, argentina, which, has, a, temperate, climate, with, rainy, summers, and, dry, winters, olive, trees, show, a, marked, preference, for, calcareous, soils, flourishing, best, on, limestone, slopes, and, crags, and, coastal, climate, conditions, they, grow, in, any, light, soil, even, on, clay, if, well, drained, but, in, rich, soils, they, are, predisposed, to, disease, and, produce, poor, quality, oil, this, was, noted, by, pliny, the, elder, olives, like, hot, weather, and, sunny, positions, without, any, shade, while, temperatures, below, 10, c, 14, f, may, injure, even, a, mature, tree, they, tolerate, drought, well, because, of, their, sturdy, and, extensive, root, systems, olive, trees, can, remain, productive, for, centuries, as, long, as, they, are, pruned, correctly, and, regularly, only, a, handful, of, olive, varieties, can, be, used, to, cross, pollinate, pendolino, olive, trees, are, partially, self, fertile, but, pollenizers, are, needed, for, a, large, fruit, crop, other, compatible, olive, tree, pollinators, include, leccino, and, maurino, pendolino, olive, trees, are, used, extensively, as, pollinizers, in, large, olive, tree, groves, olives, are, propagated, by, various, methods, the, preferred, ways, are, cuttings, and, layers, the, tree, roots, easily, in, favourable, soil, and, throws, up, suckers, from, the, stump, when, cut, down, however, yields, from, trees, grown, from, suckers, or, seeds, are, poor, they, must, be, budded, or, grafted, onto, other, specimens, to, do, well, branches, of, various, thickness, cut, into, lengths, around, 1, m, 3, 1, 2, ft, planted, deeply, in, manured, ground, soon, vegetate, shorter, pieces, are, sometimes, laid, horizontally, in, shallow, trenches, and, when, covered, with, a, few, centimetres, of, soil, rapidly, throw, up, sucker, like, shoots, in, greece, grafting, the, cultivated, tree, on, the, wild, tree, is, a, common, practice, in, italy, embryonic, buds, which, form, small, swellings, on, the, stems, are, carefully, excised, and, planted, under, the, soil, surface, where, they, soon, form, a, vigorous, shoot, the, olive, is, also, sometimes, grown, from, seed, to, facilitate, germination, the, oily, pericarp, is, first, softened, by, slight, rotting, or, soaked, in, hot, water, or, in, an, alkaline, solution, in, situations, where, extreme, cold, has, damaged, or, killed, the, olive, tree, the, rootstock, can, survive, and, produce, new, shoots, which, in, turn, become, new, trees, in, this, way, olive, trees, can, regenerate, themselves, in, tuscany, in, 1985, a, very, severe, frost, destroyed, many, productive, and, aged, olive, trees, and, ruined, many, farmers, livelihoods, however, new, shoots, appeared, in, the, spring, and, once, the, dead, wood, was, removed, became, the, basis, for, new, fruit, producing, trees, olives, grow, very, slowly, and, over, many, years, the, trunk, can, attain, a, considerable, diameter, a, p, de, candolle, recorded, one, exceeding, 10, m, 33, ft, in, girth, the, trees, rarely, exceed, 15, m, 50, ft, in, height, and, are, generally, confined, to, much, more, limited, dimensions, by, frequent, pruning, olives, are, very, hardy, and, are, resistant, to, disease, and, fire, its, root, system, is, robust, and, capable, of, regenerating, the, tree, even, if, the, above, ground, structure, is, destroyed, the, crop, from, old, trees, is, sometimes, enormous, but, they, seldom, bear, well, two, years, in, succession, and, in, many, cases, a, large, harvest, occurs, every, sixth, or, seventh, season, where, the, olive, is, carefully, cultivated, as, in, liguria, languedoc, and, provence, the, trees, are, regularly, pruned, the, pruning, preserves, the, flower, bearing, shoots, of, the, preceding, year, while, keeping, the, tree, low, enough, to, allow, the, easy, gathering, of, the, fruit, the, spaces, between, the, trees, are, regularly, fertilized, various, pathologies, can, affect, olives, the, most, serious, pest, is, the, olive, fruit, fly, dacus, oleae, or, bactrocera, oleae, which, lays, its, eggs, in, the, olive, most, commonly, just, before, it, becomes, ripe, in, the, autumn, the, region, surrounding, the, puncture, rots, becomes, brown, and, takes, a, bitter, taste, making, the, olive, unfit, for, eating, or, for, oil, for, controlling, the, pest, the, practice, has, been, to, spray, with, insecticides, organophosphates, e, g, dimethoate, classic, organic, methods, have, been, applied, such, as, trapping, applying, the, bacterium, bacillus, thuringiensis, and, spraying, with, kaolin, such, methods, are, obligatory, for, organic, olives, a, fungus, cycloconium, oleaginum, can, infect, the, trees, for, several, successive, seasons, causing, great, damage, to, plantations, a, species, of, bacterium, pseudomonas, savastanoi, pv, oleae, induces, tumour, growth, in, the, shoots, certain, lepidopterous, caterpillars, feed, on, the, leaves, and, flowers, xylella, fastidiosa, bacteria, which, can, also, infect, citrus, fruit, and, vines, has, attacked, olive, trees, in, apulia, southern, italy, causing, olive, quick, decline, syndrome, oqds, the, main, vector, is, philaenus, spumarius, meadow, spittlebug, a, pest, that, spreads, through, olive, trees, is, the, black, scale, bug, a, small, black, scale, insect, that, resembles, a, small, black, spot, they, attach, themselves, firmly, to, olive, trees, and, reduce, the, quality, of, the, fruit, their, main, predators, are, wasps, the, curculio, beetle, eats, the, edges, of, leaves, leaving, sawtooth, damage, rabbits, eat, the, bark, of, olive, trees, and, can, do, considerable, damage, especially, to, young, trees, if, the, bark, is, removed, around, the, entire, circumference, of, a, tree, it, is, likely, to, die, voles, and, mice, also, do, damage, by, eating, the, roots, of, olives, at, the, northern, edge, of, their, cultivation, zone, for, instance, in, northern, italy, southern, france, and, switzerland, olive, trees, suffer, occasionally, from, frost, gales, and, long, continued, rains, during, the, gathering, season, also, cause, damage, in, the, colder, mediterranean, hinterland, olive, cultivation, is, replaced, by, other, fruits, typically, the, chestnut, since, its, first, domestication, o, europaea, has, been, spreading, back, to, the, wild, from, planted, groves, its, original, wild, populations, in, southern, europe, have, been, largely, swamped, by, feral, plants, in, some, other, parts, of, the, world, where, it, has, been, introduced, most, notably, south, australia, the, olive, has, become, a, major, weed, that, displaces, native, vegetation, in, south, australia, its, seeds, are, spread, by, the, introduced, red, fox, and, by, many, bird, species, including, the, european, starling, and, the, native, emu, into, woodlands, where, they, germinate, and, eventually, form, a, dense, canopy, that, prevents, regeneration, of, native, trees, as, the, climate, of, south, australia, is, very, dry, and, bushfire, prone, the, oil, rich, feral, olive, tree, substantially, increases, the, fire, hazard, of, native, sclerophyll, woodlands, olives, are, harvested, in, the, autumn, and, winter, more, specifically, in, the, northern, hemisphere, green, olives, are, picked, from, the, end, of, september, to, about, the, middle, of, november, in, the, southern, hemisphere, green, olives, are, picked, from, the, middle, of, october, to, the, end, of, november, and, black, olives, are, collected, worldwide, from, the, middle, of, november, to, the, end, of, january, or, early, february, in, southern, europe, harvesting, is, done, for, several, weeks, in, winter, but, the, time, varies, in, each, country, and, with, the, season, and, the, cultivar, most, olives, today, are, harvested, by, shaking, the, boughs, or, the, whole, tree, using, olives, found, lying, on, the, ground, can, result, in, poor, quality, oil, due, to, damage, another, method, involves, standing, on, a, ladder, and, milking, the, olives, into, a, sack, tied, around, the, harvester, s, waist, this, method, produces, high, quality, oil, a, third, method, uses, a, device, called, an, oli, net, that, wraps, around, the, tree, trunk, and, opens, to, form, an, umbrella, like, catcher, from, which, workers, collect, the, fruit, another, method, uses, an, electric, tool, the, beater, abbacchiatore, in, italian, that, has, large, tongs, that, spin, around, quickly, removing, fruit, from, the, tree, olives, harvested, by, this, method, are, used, for, oil, table, olive, varieties, are, more, difficult, to, harvest, as, workers, must, take, care, not, to, damage, the, fruit, baskets, that, hang, around, the, worker, s, neck, are, used, in, some, places, in, italy, croatia, and, greece, olives, are, harvested, by, hand, because, the, terrain, is, too, mountainous, for, machines, as, a, result, the, fruit, is, not, bruised, which, leads, to, a, superior, finished, product, the, method, also, involves, sawing, off, branches, which, is, healthy, for, future, production, the, amount, of, oil, contained, in, the, fruit, differs, greatly, by, cultivar, the, pericarp, is, usually, 60, 70, oil, typical, yields, are, 1, 5, 2, 2, kg, 3, lb, 5, oz, 4, lb, 14, oz, of, oil, per, tree, per, year, olives, are, one, of, the, most, extensively, cultivated, fruit, crops, in, the, world, in, 2011, about, 9, 6, million, hectares, 24, million, acres, were, planted, with, olive, trees, which, is, more, than, twice, the, amount, of, land, devoted, to, apples, bananas, or, mangoes, only, coconut, trees, and, oil, palms, command, more, space, cultivation, area, tripled, from, 2, 6, to, 7, 95, million, hectares, 6, 4, to, 19, 6, million, acres, between, 1960, and, 1998, and, reached, a, peak, of, 10, million, hectares, 25, million, acres, in, 2008, olive, production, in, the, mediterranean, region, has, declined, since, 2019, due, to, climate, economic, and, political, factors, the, 10, most, producing, countries, according, to, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, are, all, located, in, the, mediterranean, region, and, produce, 95, of, the, world, s, olives, in, italy, cultivation, of, olive, trees, is, widespread, in, the, south, counting, for, three, quarters, of, its, production, due, to, the, climate, it, is, less, abundant, in, the, north, of, italy, although, growth, has, increased, particularly, in, the, more, temperate, microclimates, of, liguria, and, the, hills, around, lake, garda, approximately, 170, million, plants, distributed, over, 1, million, farms, one, hundred, grams, of, cured, green, olives, provide, 146, calories, are, a, rich, source, of, vitamin, e, 25, of, the, daily, value, dv, and, contain, a, large, amount, of, sodium, 104, dv, other, nutrients, are, insignificant, green, olives, are, 75, water, 15, fat, 4, carbohydrates, and, 1, protein, table, the, polyphenol, composition, of, olive, fruits, varies, during, fruit, ripening, and, during, processing, by, fermentation, when, olives, are, immersed, whole, in, brine, or, crushed, to, produce, oil, in, raw, fruit, total, polyphenol, contents, as, measured, by, the, folin, method, are, 117, mg, 100, g, in, black, olives, and, 161, mg, 100, g, in, green, olives, compared, to, 55, and, 21, mg, 100, g, for, extra, virgin, and, virgin, olive, oil, respectively, olive, fruit, contains, several, types, of, polyphenols, mainly, tyrosols, phenolic, acids, flavonols, and, flavones, and, for, black, olives, anthocyanins, the, main, bitter, flavor, of, olives, before, curing, results, from, oleuropein, and, its, aglycone, which, total, in, content, respectively, 72, and, 82, mg, 100, g, in, black, olives, and, 56, and, 59, mg, 100, g, in, green, olives, during, the, crushing, kneading, and, extraction, of, olive, fruit, to, obtain, olive, oil, oleuropein, demethyloleuropein, and, ligstroside, are, hydrolyzed, by, endogenous, beta, glucosidases, to, form, aldehydes, dialdehydes, and, aldehydic, aglycones, polyphenol, content, also, varies, with, olive, cultivar, and, the, manner, of, presentation, with, plain, olives, having, higher, contents, than, those, that, are, pitted, or, stuffed, olive, tree, pollen, is, extremely, allergenic, with, an, opals, allergy, scale, rating, of,
