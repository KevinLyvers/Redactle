slug, or, land, slug, is, a, common, name, for, any, apparently, shell, less, terrestrial, gastropod, mollusc, the, word, slug, is, also, often, used, as, part, of, the, common, name, of, any, gastropod, mollusc, that, has, no, shell, a, very, reduced, shell, or, only, a, small, internal, shell, particularly, sea, slugs, and, semi, slugs, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, common, name, snail, which, applies, to, gastropods, that, have, a, coiled, shell, large, enough, that, they, can, fully, retract, their, soft, parts, into, it, various, taxonomic, families, of, land, slugs, form, part, of, several, quite, different, evolutionary, lineages, which, also, include, snails, thus, the, various, families, of, slugs, are, not, closely, related, despite, the, superficial, similarity, in, overall, body, form, the, shell, less, condition, has, arisen, many, times, independently, as, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, and, thus, the, category, slug, is, polyphyletic, of, the, six, orders, of, pulmonata, two, the, onchidiacea, and, soleolifera, solely, comprise, slugs, a, third, group, the, sigmurethra, contains, various, clades, of, snails, semi, slugs, i, e, snails, whose, shells, are, too, small, for, them, to, retract, fully, into, and, slugs, the, taxonomy, of, this, group, is, in, the, process, of, being, revised, in, light, of, dna, sequencing, it, appears, that, pulmonates, are, paraphyletic, and, basal, to, the, opisthobranchs, which, are, a, terminal, branch, of, the, tree, the, family, ellobiidae, are, also, polyphyletic, the, external, anatomy, of, a, slug, includes, the, following, slugs, bodies, are, made, up, mostly, of, water, and, without, a, full, sized, shell, their, soft, tissues, are, prone, to, desiccation, they, must, generate, protective, mucus, to, survive, many, species, are, most, active, just, after, a, rain, because, of, the, moist, ground, or, during, nighttime, in, drier, conditions, they, hide, in, damp, places, such, as, under, tree, bark, fallen, logs, rocks, and, manmade, structures, such, as, planters, to, help, retain, body, moisture, like, all, other, gastropods, they, undergo, torsion, a, 180, twisting, of, the, internal, organs, during, development, internally, slug, anatomy, clearly, shows, the, effects, of, this, rotation, but, externally, the, bodies, of, slugs, appear, more, or, less, symmetrical, except, the, pneumostome, which, is, on, one, side, of, the, animal, normally, the, right, hand, side, slugs, produce, two, types, of, mucus, one, is, thin, and, watery, and, the, other, thick, and, sticky, both, kinds, are, hygroscopic, the, thin, mucus, spreads, from, the, foot, s, centre, to, its, edges, whereas, the, thick, mucus, spreads, from, front, to, back, slugs, also, produce, thick, mucus, that, coats, the, whole, body, of, the, animal, the, mucus, secreted, by, the, foot, contains, fibres, that, help, prevent, the, slug, from, slipping, down, vertical, surfaces, the, slime, trail, a, slug, leaves, behind, has, some, secondary, effects, other, slugs, coming, across, a, slime, trail, can, recognise, the, slime, trail, as, produced, by, one, of, the, same, species, which, is, useful, in, finding, a, mate, following, a, slime, trail, is, also, part, of, the, hunting, behaviour, of, some, carnivorous, slugs, body, mucus, provides, some, protection, against, predators, as, it, can, make, the, slug, hard, to, pick, up, and, hold, by, a, bird, s, beak, for, example, or, the, mucus, itself, can, be, distasteful, some, slugs, can, also, produce, very, sticky, mucus, which, can, incapacitate, predators, and, can, trap, them, within, the, secretion, some, species, of, slug, such, as, limax, maximus, secrete, slime, cords, to, suspend, a, pair, during, copulation, slugs, are, hermaphrodites, having, both, female, and, male, reproductive, organs, once, a, slug, has, located, a, mate, they, encircle, each, other, and, sperm, is, exchanged, through, their, protruded, genitalia, a, few, days, later, the, slugs, lay, approximately, thirty, eggs, in, a, hole, in, the, ground, or, beneath, the, cover, of, an, object, such, as, a, fallen, log, apophallation, has, been, reported, only, in, some, species, of, banana, slug, ariolimax, and, one, species, of, deroceras, in, the, banana, slugs, the, penis, sometimes, becomes, trapped, inside, the, body, of, the, partner, apophallation, allows, the, slugs, to, separate, themselves, by, one, or, both, of, the, slugs, chewing, off, the, other, s, or, its, own, penis, once, the, penis, has, been, discarded, banana, slugs, are, still, able, to, mate, using, only, the, female, parts, of, the, reproductive, system, in, a, temperate, climate, slugs, usually, live, one, year, outdoors, in, greenhouses, many, adult, slugs, may, live, for, more, than, one, year, slugs, play, an, important, role, in, the, ecosystem, by, eating, decaying, plant, material, and, fungi, most, carnivorous, slugs, on, occasion, also, eat, dead, specimens, of, their, own, kind, most, species, of, slugs, are, generalists, feeding, on, a, broad, spectrum, of, organic, materials, including, leaves, from, living, plants, lichens, mushrooms, and, even, carrion, some, slugs, are, predators, and, eat, other, slugs, and, snails, or, earthworms, slugs, can, feed, on, a, wide, variety, of, vegetables, and, herbs, including, flowers, such, as, petunias, chrysanthemums, daisies, lobelia, lilies, dahlias, narcissus, gentians, primroses, tuberous, begonias, hollyhocks, marigolds, and, fruits, such, as, strawberries, they, also, feed, on, carrots, peas, apples, and, cabbage, that, are, offered, as, a, sole, food, source, slugs, from, different, families, are, fungivores, it, is, the, case, in, the, philomycidae, e, g, philomycus, carolinianus, and, phylomicus, flexuolaris, and, ariolimacidae, ariolimax, californianus, which, respectively, feed, on, slime, molds, myxomycetes, and, mushrooms, basidiomycetes, species, of, mushroom, producing, fungi, used, as, food, source, by, slugs, include, milk, caps, lactarius, spp, the, oyster, mushroom, pleurotus, ostreatus, and, the, penny, bun, boletus, edulis, other, genera, such, as, agaricus, pleurocybella, and, russula, are, also, eaten, by, slugs, slime, molds, used, as, food, source, by, slugs, include, stemonitis, axifera, and, symphytocarpus, flaccidus, some, slugs, are, selective, towards, certain, parts, or, developmental, stages, of, the, fungi, they, eat, though, this, is, very, variable, depending, on, the, species, and, other, factors, slugs, eat, only, fungi, at, specific, stages, of, development, in, other, cases, whole, mushrooms, can, be, eaten, without, any, selection, or, bias, towards, ontogenetic, stages, slugs, are, preyed, upon, by, various, vertebrates, and, invertebrates, the, predation, of, slugs, has, been, the, subject, of, studies, for, at, least, a, century, because, some, species, of, slugs, are, considered, agricultural, pests, research, investments, have, been, made, to, discover, and, investigate, potential, predators, in, order, to, establish, biological, control, strategies, slugs, are, preyed, upon, by, virtually, every, major, vertebrate, group, with, many, examples, among, reptiles, birds, mammals, amphibians, and, fish, vertebrates, can, occasionally, feed, on, or, be, specialised, predators, of, slugs, fish, that, feed, on, slugs, include, the, brown, trout, salmo, trutta, which, occasionally, feeds, on, arion, circumscriptus, an, arionid, slug, similarly, the, shortjaw, kokopu, galaxias, postvectis, includes, slugs, in, its, diet, amphibians, such, as, frogs, and, toads, have, long, been, regarded, as, important, predators, of, slugs, among, them, are, species, in, the, genus, bufo, rhinella, and, ceratophrys, reptiles, that, feed, on, slugs, include, mainly, snakes, and, lizards, some, colubrid, snakes, are, known, predators, of, slugs, coastal, populations, of, the, garter, snake, thamnophis, elegans, have, a, specialised, diet, consisting, of, slugs, such, as, ariolimax, while, inland, populations, have, a, generalized, diet, one, of, its, congeners, the, northwestern, garter, snake, thamnophis, ordinoides, is, not, a, specialized, predator, of, slugs, but, occasionally, feeds, on, them, the, redbelly, snake, storeria, occipitomaculata, and, the, brown, snake, storeria, dekayi, feed, mainly, but, not, solely, on, slugs, while, some, species, in, the, genus, dipsas, e, g, dipsas, neuwiedi, and, the, common, slug, eater, snake, duberria, lutrix, are, exclusively, slug, eaters, several, lizards, include, slugs, in, their, diet, this, is, the, case, in, the, slowworm, anguis, fragilis, the, bobtail, lizard, tiliqua, rugosa, the, she, oak, skink, cyclodomorphus, casuarinae, and, the, common, lizard, zootoca, vivipara, birds, that, prey, upon, slugs, include, common, blackbirds, turdus, merula, starlings, sturnus, vulgaris, rooks, corvus, frugilegus, jackdaws, corvus, monedula, owls, vultures, and, ducks, studies, on, slug, predation, also, cite, fieldfares, feeding, on, deroceras, reticulatum, redwings, feeding, on, limax, and, arion, thrushes, on, limax, and, arion, ater, red, grouse, on, deroceras, and, arion, hortensis, game, birds, wrynecks, on, limax, flavus, rock, doves, and, charadriiform, birds, as, slug, predators, mammals, that, eat, slugs, include, foxes, badgers, and, hedgehogs, beetles, in, the, family, carabidae, such, as, carabus, violaceus, and, pterostichus, melanarius, are, known, to, feed, on, slugs, ants, are, a, common, predator, of, slugs, some, ant, species, are, deterred, by, the, slug, s, mucus, coating, while, others, such, as, driver, ants, will, roll, the, slug, in, dirt, to, absorb, its, mucus, slugs, are, parasitised, by, several, organisms, including, acari, and, a, wide, variety, of, nematodes, the, slug, mite, riccardoella, limacum, is, known, to, parasitise, several, dozen, species, of, molluscs, including, many, slugs, such, as, deroceras, reticulatum, arianta, arbustorum, arion, ater, arion, hortensis, limax, maximus, tandonia, budapestensis, milax, gagates, and, tandonia, sowerbyi, r, limacum, can, often, be, seen, swarming, about, their, host, s, body, and, live, in, its, respiratory, cavity, several, species, of, nematodes, are, known, to, parasitise, slugs, the, nematode, worms, agfa, flexilis, and, angiostoma, limacis, respectively, live, in, the, salivary, glands, and, rectum, of, limax, maximus, species, of, widely, known, medical, importance, pertaining, to, the, genus, angiostrongylus, are, also, parasites, of, slugs, both, angiostrongylus, costaricensis, and, angiostrongylus, cantonensis, a, meningitis, causing, nematode, have, larval, stages, that, can, only, live, in, molluscs, including, slugs, such, as, limax, maximus, insects, such, as, dipterans, are, known, parasitoids, of, molluscs, to, complete, their, development, many, dipterans, use, slugs, as, hosts, during, their, ontogeny, some, species, of, blow, flies, calliphoridae, in, the, genus, melinda, are, known, parasitoids, of, arionidae, limacidae, and, philomycidae, flies, in, the, family, phoridae, specially, those, in, the, genus, megaselia, are, parasitoids, of, agriolimacidae, including, many, species, of, deroceras, house, flies, in, the, family, muscidae, mainly, those, in, the, genus, sarcophaga, are, facultative, parasitoids, of, arionidae, when, attacked, slugs, can, contract, their, body, making, themselves, harder, and, more, compact, and, more, still, and, round, by, doing, this, they, become, firmly, attached, to, the, substrate, this, combined, with, the, slippery, mucus, they, produce, makes, slugs, more, difficult, for, predators, to, grasp, the, unpleasant, taste, of, the, mucus, is, also, a, deterrent, slugs, can, also, incapacitate, predators, through, the, production, of, a, highly, sticky, and, elastic, mucus, which, can, trap, predators, in, the, secretion, some, species, present, different, response, behaviors, when, attacked, such, as, the, kerry, slug, in, contrast, to, the, general, behavioral, pattern, the, kerry, slug, retracts, its, head, lets, go, of, the, substrate, rolls, up, completely, and, stays, contracted, in, a, ball, like, shape, this, is, a, unique, feature, among, all, the, arionidae, and, among, most, other, slugs, some, slugs, can, self, amputate, autotomy, a, portion, of, their, tail, to, help, the, slug, escape, from, a, predator, some, slug, species, hibernate, underground, during, the, winter, in, temperate, climates, but, in, other, species, the, adults, die, in, the, autumn, intra, and, inter, specific, agonistic, behavior, is, documented, but, varies, greatly, among, slug, species, slugs, often, resort, to, aggression, attacking, both, conspecifics, and, individuals, from, other, species, when, competing, for, resources, this, aggressiveness, is, also, influenced, by, seasonality, because, the, availability, of, resources, such, as, shelter, and, food, may, be, compromised, due, to, climatic, conditions, slugs, are, prone, to, attack, during, the, summer, when, the, availability, of, resources, is, reduced, during, winter, the, aggressive, responses, are, substituted, by, a, gregarious, behavior, the, great, majority, of, slug, species, are, harmless, to, humans, and, to, their, interests, but, a, small, number, of, species, are, serious, pests, of, agriculture, and, horticulture, they, can, destroy, foliage, faster, than, plants, can, grow, thus, killing, even, fairly, large, plants, they, also, feed, on, fruits, and, vegetables, prior, to, harvest, making, holes, in, the, crop, which, can, make, individual, items, unsuitable, to, sell, for, aesthetic, reasons, and, can, make, the, crop, more, vulnerable, to, rot, and, disease, excessive, buildup, of, slugs, within, some, wastewater, treatment, plants, with, inadequate, screening, have, been, found, to, cause, process, issues, resulting, in, increased, energy, and, chemical, use, in, a, few, rare, cases, humans, have, developed, angiostrongylus, cantonensis, induced, meningitis, from, eating, raw, slugs, live, slugs, that, are, accidentally, eaten, with, improperly, cleaned, vegetables, such, as, lettuce, or, improperly, cooked, slugs, for, use, in, recipes, requiring, larger, slugs, such, as, banana, slugs, can, act, as, a, vector, for, a, parasitic, infection, in, humans, as, control, measures, baits, are, commonly, used, in, both, agriculture, and, the, garden, in, recent, years, iron, phosphate, baits, have, emerged, and, are, preferred, over, the, more, toxic, metaldehyde, especially, because, domestic, or, wild, animals, may, be, exposed, to, the, bait, the, environmentally, safer, iron, phosphate, has, been, shown, to, be, at, least, as, effective, as, baits, methiocarb, baits, are, no, longer, widely, used, parasitic, nematodes, phasmarhabditis, hermaphrodita, are, a, commercially, available, biological, control, method, that, are, effective, against, a, wide, range, of, common, slug, species, the, nematodes, are, applied, in, water, and, actively, seek, out, slugs, in, the, soil, and, infect, them, leading, to, the, death, of, the, slug, this, control, method, is, suitable, for, use, in, organic, growing, systems, other, slug, control, methods, are, generally, ineffective, on, a, large, scale, but, can, be, somewhat, useful, in, small, gardens, these, include, beer, traps, diatomaceous, earth, crushed, eggshells, coffee, grounds, and, copper, salt, kills, slugs, by, causing, water, to, leave, the, body, owing, to, osmosis, but, this, is, not, used, for, agricultural, control, as, soil, salinity, is, detrimental, to, crops, conservation, tillage, worsens, slug, infestations, hammond, et, al, 1999, find, maize, corn, and, soybean, in, the, us, to, be, more, severely, affected, under, low, till, because, this, increases, organic, matter, thus, providing, food, and, shelter
