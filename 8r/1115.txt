the, carrot, daucus, carota, subsp, sativus, is, a, root, vegetable, typically, orange, in, color, though, heirloom, variants, including, purple, black, red, white, and, yellow, cultivars, exist, all, of, which, are, domesticated, forms, of, the, wild, carrot, daucus, carota, native, to, europe, and, southwestern, asia, the, plant, probably, originated, in, iran, and, was, originally, cultivated, for, its, leaves, and, seeds, the, most, commonly, eaten, part, of, the, plant, is, the, taproot, although, the, stems, and, leaves, are, also, eaten, the, domestic, carrot, has, been, selectively, bred, for, its, enlarged, more, palatable, less, woody, textured, taproot, carrots, are, commonly, consumed, raw, or, cooked, in, various, cuisines, reflected, by, the, characteristic, orange, color, carrots, are, a, rich, source, of, the, provitamin, a, compound, beta, carotene, which, converts, to, vitamin, a, upon, digestion, the, carrot, is, a, biennial, plant, in, the, umbellifer, family, apiaceae, young, plants, have, a, rosette, of, leaves, while, building, up, the, enlarged, taproot, fast, growing, cultivars, mature, within, about, three, months, 90, days, of, sowing, the, seed, while, slower, maturing, cultivars, need, a, month, longer, 120, days, world, production, of, carrots, combined, with, turnips, for, 2022, was, 42, million, tonnes, led, by, china, producing, 44, of, the, total, the, word, is, first, recorded, in, english, around, 1530, and, was, borrowed, from, the, middle, french, carotte, itself, from, the, late, latin, car, ta, from, the, ancient, greek, kar, t, n, originally, from, the, prot, o, indo, european, root, ker, horn, due, to, its, horn, like, shape, in, old, english, carrots, typically, white, at, the, time, were, not, clearly, distinguished, from, parsnips, the, word, s, use, as, a, color, name, in, english, was, first, recorded, around, 1670, originally, referring, to, yellowish, red, hair, various, languages, still, use, the, same, word, for, carrot, as, they, do, for, root, e, g, the, dutch, wortel, daucus, carota, is, a, biennial, plant, in, the, first, year, its, rosette, of, leaves, produces, large, amounts, of, sugars, which, are, stored, in, the, taproot, to, provide, energy, for, the, plant, to, flower, in, the, second, year, soon, after, germination, carrot, seedlings, show, a, distinct, demarcation, between, taproot, and, stem, the, stem, is, thicker, and, lacks, lateral, roots, at, the, upper, end, of, the, stem, is, the, seed, leaf, the, first, true, leaf, appears, about, 10, 15, days, after, germination, subsequent, leaves, are, alternate, with, a, single, leaf, attached, to, a, node, spirally, arranged, and, pinnately, compound, with, leaf, bases, sheathing, the, stem, as, the, plant, grows, the, bases, of, the, seed, leaves, near, the, taproot, are, pushed, apart, the, stem, located, just, above, the, ground, is, compressed, and, the, internodes, are, not, distinct, when, the, seed, stalk, elongates, for, flowering, the, tip, of, the, stem, narrows, and, becomes, pointed, and, the, stem, extends, upward, to, become, a, highly, branched, inflorescence, up, to, 60, 200, cm, 20, 80, in, tall, most, of, the, taproot, consists, of, a, pulpy, outer, cortex, phloem, and, an, inner, core, xylem, high, quality, carrots, have, a, large, proportion, of, cortex, compared, to, core, although, a, completely, xylem, free, carrot, is, not, possible, some, cultivars, have, small, and, deeply, pigmented, cores, the, taproot, can, appear, to, lack, a, core, when, the, color, of, the, cortex, and, core, are, similar, in, intensity, taproots, are, typically, long, and, conical, although, cylindrical, and, nearly, spherical, cultivars, are, available, the, root, diameter, can, range, from, 1, cm, 3, 8, in, to, as, much, as, 10, cm, 4, in, at, the, widest, part, the, root, length, ranges, from, 5, to, 50, cm, 2, to, 20, in, although, most, are, between, 10, and, 25, cm, 4, and, 10, in, flower, development, begins, when, the, flat, meristem, changes, from, producing, leaves, to, an, uplifted, conical, meristem, capable, of, producing, stem, elongation, and, a, cluster, of, flowers, the, cluster, is, a, compound, umbel, and, each, umbel, contains, several, smaller, umbels, umbellets, the, first, primary, umbel, occurs, at, the, end, of, the, main, floral, stem, smaller, secondary, umbels, grow, from, the, main, branch, and, these, further, branch, into, third, fourth, and, even, later, flowering, umbels, a, large, primary, umbel, can, contain, up, to, 50, umbellets, each, of, which, may, have, as, many, as, 50, flowers, subsequent, umbels, have, fewer, flowers, individual, flowers, are, small, and, white, sometimes, with, a, light, green, or, yellow, tint, they, consist, of, five, petals, five, stamens, and, an, entire, calyx, the, stamens, usually, split, and, fall, off, before, the, stigma, becomes, receptive, to, receive, pollen, the, stamens, of, the, brown, male, sterile, flowers, degenerate, and, shrivel, before, the, flower, fully, opens, in, the, other, type, of, male, sterile, flower, the, stamens, are, replaced, by, petals, and, these, petals, do, not, fall, off, a, nectar, containing, disc, is, present, on, the, upper, surface, of, the, carpels, flowers, change, sex, in, their, development, so, the, stamens, release, their, pollen, before, the, stigma, of, the, same, flower, is, receptive, the, arrangement, is, centripetal, meaning, the, oldest, flowers, are, near, the, edge, and, the, youngest, flowers, are, in, the, center, flowers, usually, first, open, at, the, outer, edge, of, the, primary, umbel, followed, about, a, week, later, on, the, secondary, umbels, and, then, in, subsequent, weeks, in, higher, order, umbels, the, usual, flowering, period, of, individual, umbels, is, 7, to, 10, days, so, a, plant, can, be, in, the, process, of, flowering, for, 30, 50, days, the, distinctive, umbels, and, floral, nectaries, attract, pollinating, insects, after, fertilization, and, as, seeds, develop, the, outer, umbellets, of, an, umbel, bend, inward, causing, the, umbel, shape, to, change, from, slightly, convex, or, fairly, flat, to, concave, and, when, cupped, it, resembles, a, bird, s, nest, the, fruit, that, develops, is, a, schizocarp, consisting, of, two, mericarps, each, mericarp, is, a, true, seed, the, paired, mericarps, are, easily, separated, when, they, are, dry, premature, separation, shattering, before, harvest, is, undesirable, because, it, can, result, in, seed, loss, mature, seeds, are, flattened, on, the, commissural, side, that, faced, the, septum, of, the, ovary, the, flattened, side, has, five, longitudinal, ribs, the, bristly, hairs, that, protrude, from, some, ribs, are, usually, removed, by, abrasion, during, milling, and, cleaning, seeds, also, contain, oil, ducts, and, canals, seeds, vary, somewhat, in, size, ranging, from, less, than, 500, to, more, than, 1000, seeds, per, gram, the, carrot, is, a, diploid, species, and, has, nine, relatively, short, uniform, length, chromosomes, 2, n, 18, the, genome, size, is, estimated, to, be, 473, mega, base, pairs, which, is, four, times, larger, than, arabidopsis, thaliana, one, fifth, the, size, of, the, maize, genome, and, about, the, same, size, as, the, rice, genome, polyacetylenes, can, be, found, in, apiaceae, vegetables, like, carrots, where, they, show, cytotoxic, activities, falcarinol, and, falcarindiol, cis, heptadeca, 1, 9, diene, 4, 6, diyne, 3, 8, diol, are, such, compounds, this, latter, compound, shows, antifungal, activity, towards, mycocentrospora, acerina, and, cladosporium, cladosporioides, falcarindiol, is, the, main, compound, responsible, for, bitterness, in, carrots, other, compounds, include, pyrrolidine, present, in, the, leaves, and, 6, hydroxymellein, both, written, history, and, molecular, genetic, studies, indicate, that, the, domestic, carrot, has, a, single, origin, in, central, asia, its, wild, ancestors, probably, originated, in, greater, iran, regions, of, which, are, now, iran, and, afghanistan, which, remains, the, centre, of, diversity, for, the, wild, carrot, daucus, carota, a, naturally, occurring, subspecies, of, the, wild, carrot, was, presumably, bred, selectively, over, the, centuries, to, reduce, bitterness, increase, sweetness, and, minimise, the, woody, core, this, process, produced, the, familiar, garden, vegetable, when, they, were, first, cultivated, carrots, were, grown, for, their, aromatic, leaves, and, seeds, rather, than, their, roots, carrot, seeds, have, been, found, in, switzerland, and, southern, germany, dating, back, to, 2000, 3000, bc, some, close, relatives, of, the, carrot, are, still, grown, for, their, leaves, and, seeds, such, as, parsley, coriander, cilantro, fennel, anise, dill, and, cumin, the, first, mention, of, the, root, in, classical, sources, is, from, the, 1st, century, ad, the, romans, ate, a, root, vegetable, called, pastinaca, which, may, have, been, either, the, carrot, or, the, closely, related, parsnip, the, plant, is, depicted, and, described, in, the, eastern, roman, juliana, anicia, codex, a, 6th, century, ad, constantinopolitan, copy, of, the, greek, physician, dioscorides, 1st, century, pharmacopoeia, of, herbs, and, medicines, de, materia, medica, three, different, types, of, carrots, are, depicted, and, the, text, states, that, the, root, can, be, cooked, and, eaten, another, copy, of, this, work, codex, neapolitanes, from, late, 6th, or, early, 7th, century, has, basically, the, same, illustrations, but, with, roots, in, purple, the, plant, was, introduced, into, spain, by, the, moors, in, the, 8th, century, in, the, 10th, century, roots, from, west, asia, india, and, europe, were, purple, the, modern, carrot, originated, in, afghanistan, at, about, this, time, the, 11th, century, jewish, scholar, simeon, seth, describes, both, red, and, yellow, carrots, as, does, the, 12th, century, arab, andalusian, agriculturist, ibn, al, awwam, cultivated, carrots, appeared, in, china, in, the, 12th, century, and, in, japan, in, the, 16th, or, 17th, century, the, orange, carrot, was, created, by, the, dutch, growers, there, is, pictorial, evidence, that, the, orange, carrot, existed, at, least, in, 512, but, it, is, probable, that, it, was, not, a, stable, variety, until, the, dutch, bred, the, cultivar, termed, the, long, orange, at, the, turn, of, the, 18th, century, some, claim, that, the, dutch, created, the, orange, carrots, to, honor, the, dutch, flag, at, the, time, and, william, of, orange, but, other, authorities, argue, these, claims, lack, convincing, evidence, and, it, is, possible, that, the, orange, carrot, was, favored, by, the, europeans, because, it, does, not, brown, the, soups, and, stews, as, the, purple, carrot, does, and, as, such, was, more, visually, attractive, modern, carrots, were, described, at, about, this, time, by, the, english, antiquary, john, aubrey, 1626, 1697, carrots, were, first, sown, at, beckington, in, somersetshire, some, very, old, man, there, did, remember, their, first, bringing, hither, european, settlers, introduced, the, carrot, to, colonial, america, in, the, 17th, century, outwardly, purple, carrots, still, orange, on, the, inside, were, sold, in, british, stores, beginning, in, 2002, carrots, are, grown, from, seed, and, can, take, up, to, four, months, 120, days, to, mature, but, most, cultivars, mature, within, 70, to, 80, days, under, the, right, conditions, they, grow, best, in, full, sun, but, tolerate, some, shade, the, optimum, temperature, is, 16, to, 21, c, 61, to, 70, f, the, ideal, soil, is, deep, loose, and, well, drained, sandy, or, loamy, with, a, ph, of, 6, 3, to, 6, 8, fertilizer, should, be, applied, according, to, soil, type, because, the, crop, requires, low, levels, of, nitrogen, moderate, phosphate, and, high, potash, rich, or, rocky, soils, should, be, avoided, as, these, will, cause, the, roots, to, become, hairy, and, or, misshapen, irrigation, is, applied, when, needed, to, keep, the, soil, moist, after, sprouting, the, crop, is, eventually, thinned, to, a, spacing, of, 8, to, 10, cm, 3, to, 4, in, and, weeded, to, prevent, competition, beneath, the, soil, there, are, several, diseases, that, can, reduce, the, yield, and, market, value, of, carrots, the, most, devastating, carrot, disease, is, alternaria, leaf, blight, which, has, been, known, to, eradicate, entire, crops, a, bacterial, leaf, blight, caused, by, xanthomonas, campestris, can, also, be, destructive, in, warm, humid, areas, root, knot, nematodes, meloidogyne, species, can, cause, stubby, or, forked, roots, or, galls, cavity, spot, caused, by, the, oomycetes, pythium, violae, and, pythium, sulcatum, results, in, irregularly, shaped, depressed, lesions, on, the, taproots, physical, damage, can, also, reduce, the, value, of, carrot, crops, the, two, main, forms, of, damage, are, splitting, whereby, a, longitudinal, crack, develops, during, growth, that, can, be, a, few, centimetres, to, the, entire, length, of, the, root, and, breaking, which, occurs, postharvest, these, disorders, can, affect, over, 30, of, commercial, crops, factors, associated, with, high, levels, of, splitting, include, wide, plant, spacing, early, sowing, lengthy, growth, durations, and, genotype, they, can, also, be, good, companions, for, other, plants, if, left, to, flower, the, carrot, like, any, umbellifer, attracts, predatory, wasps, that, kill, many, garden, pests, carrot, cultivars, can, be, grouped, into, two, broad, classes, eastern, carrots, and, western, carrots, a, number, of, novelty, cultivars, have, been, bred, for, particular, characteristics, eastern, a, european, and, american, continent, reference, carrots, were, domesticated, in, persia, probably, in, the, lands, of, modern, day, iran, and, afghanistan, within, west, asia, during, the, 10th, century, or, possibly, earlier, specimens, of, the, eastern, carrot, that, survive, to, the, present, day, are, commonly, purple, or, yellow, and, often, have, branched, roots, the, purple, color, common, in, these, carrots, comes, from, anthocyanin, pigments, the, western, carrot, emerged, in, the, netherlands, in, the, 16th, or, 17th, century, there, is, a, popular, belief, that, its, orange, color, made, it, popular, in, those, countries, as, an, emblem, of, the, house, of, orange, and, the, struggle, for, dutch, independence, although, there, is, little, evidence, for, this, beyond, oral, tradition, and, the, timing, the, orange, color, results, from, abundant, carotenes, in, these, cultivars, western, carrot, cultivars, are, commonly, classified, by, their, root, shape, the, four, general, types, are, carrot, breeding, programs, have, developed, new, cultivars, to, have, dense, amounts, of, chemically, stable, acylated, pigments, such, as, anthocyanins, which, enrich, carrot, color, based, on, the, density, and, types, of, anthocyanin, to, produce, different, carrot, colors, one, particular, cultivar, lacks, the, usual, orange, pigment, due, to, carotene, owing, its, white, color, to, a, recessive, gene, for, tocopherol, vitamin, e, but, this, cultivar, and, wild, carrots, do, not, provide, nutritionally, significant, amounts, of, vitamin, e, carrots, can, be, stored, for, several, months, in, the, refrigerator, or, over, winter, in, a, dry, but, humid, cool, place, for, long, term, storage, unwashed, carrots, can, be, placed, in, a, bucket, between, dry, layers, of, sand, a, 50, 50, mix, of, sand, and, wood, shavings, or, in, soil, a, temperature, range, of, 0, to, 4, c, 32, to, 40, f, and, 90, 95, humidity, is, best, during, storage, carrots, may, be, subject, to, the, development, of, bitterness, white, blush, and, browning, leading, to, carrot, losses, bitterness, can, be, prevented, by, storage, in, well, ventilated, rooms, with, low, ethylene, content, for, example, without, ethylene, producing, fruit, and, vegetables, white, blush, and, browning, can, be, countered, with, application, of, edible, films, heat, treatment, application, of, hydrogen, sulfide, and, ultraviolet, irradiation, in, 2022, world, production, of, carrots, combined, with, turnips, was, 42, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 44, of, the, total, table, raw, carrots, are, 88, water, 9, carbohydrates, 1, protein, and, contain, negligible, fat, table, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, raw, carrots, supply, 41, calories, and, have, a, rich, content, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, vitamin, a, 93, dv, and, a, moderate, amount, 10, 19, dv, of, vitamin, k, 11, dv, and, potassium, 11, dv, but, otherwise, have, low, content, of, micronutrients, table, as, a, common, source, of, beta, carotene, in, diets, carrots, are, noted, as, a, provitamin, a, source, by, converting, beta, carotene, into, vitamin, a, in, the, small, intestine, via, an, enzyme, reaction, carrots, can, be, eaten, in, a, variety, of, ways, only, 3, percent, of, the, carotene, in, raw, carrots, is, released, during, digestion, this, can, be, improved, to, 39, by, pulping, cooking, and, adding, cooking, oil, alternatively, they, may, be, chopped, and, boiled, fried, or, steamed, and, cooked, in, soups, and, stews, as, well, as, baby, and, pet, foods, a, well, known, dish, is, carrots, julienne, together, with, onion, and, celery, carrots, are, one, of, the, primary, vegetables, used, in, a, mirepoix, to, make, various, broths, the, greens, are, edible, as, a, leaf, vegetable, but, are, rarely, eaten, by, humans, some, sources, suggest, that, the, greens, contain, toxic, alkaloids, when, used, for, this, purpose, they, are, harvested, young, in, high, density, plantings, before, significant, root, development, and, typically, used, stir, fried, or, in, salads, some, people, are, allergic, to, carrots, in, a, 2010, study, on, the, prevalence, of, food, allergies, in, europe, 3, 6, percent, of, young, adults, showed, some, degree, of, sensitivity, to, carrots, because, the, major, carrot, allergen, the, protein, dauc, c, 1, 0104, is, cross, reactive, with, homologues, in, birch, pollen, bet, v, 1, and, mugwort, pollen, art, v, 1, most, carrot, allergy, sufferers, are, also, allergic, to, pollen, from, these, plants, in, india, carrots, are, used, in, a, variety, of, ways, as, salads, or, as, vegetables, added, to, spicy, rice, or, dal, dishes, a, popular, variation, in, north, india, is, the, gajar, ka, halwa, carrot, dessert, which, has, carrots, grated, and, cooked, in, milk, until, the, whole, mixture, is, solid, after, which, nuts, and, butter, are, added, carrot, salads, are, usually, made, with, grated, carrots, with, a, seasoning, of, mustard, seeds, and, green, chillies, popped, in, hot, oil, carrots, can, also, be, cut, into, thin, strips, and, added, to, rice, can, form, part, of, a, dish, of, mixed, roast, vegetables, or, can, be, blended, with, tamarind, to, make, chutney, since, the, late, 1980s, baby, carrots, or, mini, carrots, carrots, that, have, been, peeled, and, cut, into, uniform, cylinders, have, been, a, popular, ready, to, eat, snack, food, available, in, many, supermarkets, carrots, are, pur, ed, and, used, as, baby, food, dehydrated, to, make, chips, flakes, and, powder, and, thinly, sliced, and, deep, fried, like, potato, chips, the, sweetness, of, carrots, allows, the, vegetable, to, be, used, in, some, fruit, like, roles, grated, carrots, are, used, in, carrot, cakes, as, well, as, carrot, puddings, an, english, dish, thought, to, have, originated, in, the, early, 19th, century, carrots, can, also, be, used, alone, or, blended, with, fruits, in, jams, and, preserves, in, the, european, union, there, is, a, rule, specifying, that, only, fruits, can, be, used, in, making, jams, to, preserve, the, portuguese, carrot, jam, delicacy, or, doce, de, cenoura, in, portuguese, the, eu, council, adopted, a, directive, that, changed, the, legal, statute, of, carrot, from, vegetable, into, fruit, carrot, juice, is, also, widely, marketed, especially, as, a, health, drink, either, stand, alone, or, blended, with, juices, extracted, from, fruits, and, other, vegetables, very, high, consumption, of, carrots, over, a, longer, period, of, time, can, result, in, carotenemia, a, harmless, yellow, orange, discoloration, of, the, skin, caused, by, a, buildup, of, carotenoids, despite, popular, belief, the, provitamin, a, beta, carotene, from, carrots, does, not, actually, help, people, to, see, in, the, dark, unless, they, suffer, from, vitamin, a, deficiency, this, myth, was, propaganda, used, by, the, royal, air, force, during, the, second, world, war, to, explain, why, british, pilots, had, improved, night, vision, which, enabled, their, success, during, nighttime, air, battles, in, reality, it, was, thanks, to, newly, adopted, radar, technology, the, consumption, of, carrots, was, advocated, in, britain, at, the, time, as, part, of, a, dig, for, victory, campaign, a, radio, program, called, the, kitchen, front, encouraged, people, to, grow, store, and, use, carrots, in, various, novel, ways, including, making, carrot, jam, and, woolton, pie, named, after, the, lord, woolton, the, minister, for, food, the, british, public, during, wwii, generally, believed, that, eating, carrots, would, help, them, see, better, at, night, and, in, 1942, there, was, a, 100, 000, ton, surplus, of, carrots, from, the, extra, production
