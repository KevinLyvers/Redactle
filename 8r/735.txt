canis, familiaris, linnaeus, 1758, canis, familiaris, dingo, meyer, 1793, the, dingo, either, included, in, the, species, canis, familiaris, or, considered, one, of, the, following, independent, taxa, canis, familiaris, dingo, canis, dingo, or, canis, lupus, dingo, is, an, ancient, basal, lineage, of, dog, found, in, australia, its, taxonomic, classification, is, debated, as, indicated, by, the, variety, of, scientific, names, presently, applied, in, different, publications, it, is, variously, considered, a, form, of, domestic, dog, not, warranting, recognition, as, a, subspecies, a, subspecies, of, dog, or, wolf, or, a, full, species, in, its, own, right, the, dingo, is, a, medium, sized, canine, that, possesses, a, lean, hardy, body, adapted, for, speed, agility, and, stamina, the, dingo, s, three, main, coat, colourations, are, light, ginger, or, tan, black, and, tan, or, creamy, white, the, skull, is, wedge, shaped, and, appears, large, in, proportion, to, the, body, the, dingo, is, closely, related, to, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, their, lineage, split, early, from, the, lineage, that, led, to, today, s, domestic, dogs, and, can, be, traced, back, through, maritime, southeast, asia, to, asia, the, oldest, remains, of, dingoes, in, australia, are, around, 3, 500, years, old, a, dingo, pack, usually, consists, of, a, mated, pair, their, offspring, from, the, current, year, and, sometimes, offspring, from, the, previous, year, the, name, dingo, comes, from, the, dharug, language, used, by, the, indigenous, australians, of, the, sydney, area, the, first, british, colonists, to, arrive, in, australia, in, 1788, established, a, settlement, at, port, jackson, and, noted, dingoes, living, with, indigenous, australians, the, name, was, first, recorded, in, 1789, by, watkin, tench, in, his, narrative, of, the, expedition, to, botany, bay, the, only, domestic, animal, they, have, is, the, dog, which, in, their, language, is, called, dingo, and, a, good, deal, resembles, the, fox, dog, of, england, these, animals, are, equally, shy, of, us, and, attached, to, the, natives, one, of, them, is, now, in, the, possession, of, the, governor, and, tolerably, well, reconciled, to, his, new, master, related, dharug, words, include, ting, ko, meaning, bitch, and, tun, go, wo, re, gal, meaning, large, dog, the, dingo, has, different, names, in, different, indigenous, australian, languages, such, as, boolomo, dwer, da, joogoong, kal, kurpany, maliki, mirigung, noggum, papa, inura, and, wantibirri, some, authors, propose, that, a, difference, existed, between, camp, dingoes, and, wild, dingoes, as, they, had, different, names, among, indigenous, tribes, the, people, of, the, yarralin, northern, territory, region, frequently, call, those, dingoes, that, live, with, them, walaku, and, those, that, live, in, the, wilderness, ngurakin, they, also, use, the, name, walaku, to, refer, to, both, dingoes, and, dogs, the, colonial, settlers, of, new, south, wales, wrote, using, the, name, dingo, only, for, camp, dogs, it, is, proposed, that, in, new, south, wales, the, camp, dingoes, only, became, wild, after, the, collapse, of, aboriginal, society, dogs, associated, with, indigenous, people, were, first, recorded, by, jan, carstenszoon, in, the, cape, york, peninsula, area, in, 1623, in, 1699, captain, william, dampier, visited, the, coast, of, what, is, now, western, australia, and, recorded, that, my, men, saw, two, or, three, beasts, like, hungry, wolves, lean, like, so, many, skeletons, being, nothing, but, skin, and, bones, in, 1788, the, first, fleet, arrived, in, botany, bay, under, the, command, of, australia, s, first, colonial, governor, arthur, phillip, who, took, ownership, of, a, dingo, and, in, his, journal, made, a, brief, description, with, an, illustration, of, the, dog, of, new, south, wales, in, 1793, based, on, phillip, s, brief, description, and, illustration, the, dog, of, new, south, wales, was, classified, by, friedrich, meyer, as, canis, dingo, in, 1999, a, study, of, the, maternal, lineage, through, the, use, of, mitochondrial, dna, mdna, as, a, genetic, marker, indicates, that, the, dingo, and, new, guinea, singing, dog, developed, at, a, time, when, human, populations, were, more, isolated, from, each, other, in, the, third, edition, of, mammal, species, of, the, world, published, in, 2005, the, mammalogist, w, christopher, wozencraft, listed, under, the, wolf, canis, lupus, its, wild, subspecies, and, proposed, two, additional, subspecies, familiaris, linnaeus, 1758, and, dingo, meyer, 1793, wozencraft, included, hallstromi, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, as, a, taxonomic, synonym, for, the, dingo, he, referred, to, the, mdna, study, as, one, of, the, guides, in, forming, his, decision, the, inclusion, of, familiaris, and, dingo, under, a, domestic, dog, clade, has, been, noted, by, other, mammalogists, and, their, classification, under, the, wolf, debated, in, 2019, a, workshop, hosted, by, the, iucn, ssc, canid, specialist, group, considered, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, and, the, dingo, to, be, feral, dogs, canis, familiaris, which, therefore, should, not, be, assessed, for, the, iucn, red, list, in, 2020, the, american, society, of, mammalogists, considered, the, dingo, a, synonym, of, the, domestic, dog, however, recent, dna, sequencing, of, a, pure, wild, dingo, from, south, australia, suggests, that, the, dingo, is, intermediate, between, wolves, and, domestic, dogs, the, dingo, is, regarded, as, a, feral, dog, because, it, descended, from, domesticated, ancestors, the, dingo, s, relationship, with, indigenous, australians, is, one, of, commensalism, in, which, two, organisms, live, in, close, association, but, do, not, depend, on, each, other, for, survival, they, both, hunt, and, sleep, together, the, dingo, is, therefore, comfortable, enough, around, humans, to, associate, with, them, but, is, still, capable, of, living, independently, any, free, ranging, unowned, dog, can, be, socialised, to, become, an, owned, dog, as, some, dingoes, do, when, they, join, human, families, although, the, dingo, exists, in, the, wild, it, associates, with, humans, but, has, not, been, selectively, bred, similarly, to, other, domesticated, animals, therefore, its, status, as, a, domestic, animal, is, not, clear, whether, the, dingo, was, a, wild, or, domesticated, species, was, not, clarified, from, meyer, s, original, description, which, translated, from, the, german, language, reads, it, is, not, known, if, it, is, the, only, dog, species, in, new, south, wales, and, if, it, can, also, still, be, found, in, the, wild, state, however, so, far, it, appears, to, have, lost, little, of, its, wild, condition, moreover, no, divergent, varieties, have, been, discovered, the, earliest, known, dingo, remains, found, in, western, australia, date, to, 3, 450, years, ago, based, on, a, comparison, of, modern, dingoes, with, these, early, remains, dingo, morphology, has, not, changed, over, thousands, of, years, this, suggests, that, no, artificial, selection, has, been, applied, over, this, period, and, that, the, dingo, represents, an, early, form, of, dog, they, have, lived, bred, and, undergone, natural, selection, in, the, wild, isolated, from, other, dogs, until, the, arrival, of, european, settlers, resulting, in, a, unique, breed, in, 2020, an, mdna, study, of, ancient, dog, remains, from, the, yellow, river, and, yangtze, river, basins, of, southern, china, showed, that, most, of, the, ancient, dogs, fell, within, haplogroup, a1b, as, do, the, australian, dingoes, and, the, pre, colonial, dogs, of, the, pacific, but, in, low, frequency, in, china, today, the, specimen, from, the, tianluoshan, archaeological, site, zhejiang, province, dates, to, 7, 000, ybp, years, before, present, and, is, basal, to, the, entire, haplogroup, a1b, lineage, the, dogs, belonging, to, this, haplogroup, were, once, widely, distributed, in, southern, china, then, dispersed, through, southeast, asia, into, new, guinea, and, oceania, but, were, replaced, in, china, by, dogs, of, other, lineages, 2, 000, ybp, the, oldest, reliable, date, for, dog, remains, found, in, mainland, southeast, asia, is, from, vietnam, at, 4, 000, ybp, and, in, island, southeast, asia, from, timor, leste, at, 3, 000, ybp, the, earliest, dingo, remains, in, the, torres, straits, date, to, 2, 100, ybp, in, new, guinea, the, earliest, dog, remains, date, to, 2, 500, 2, 300, ybp, from, caution, bay, near, port, moresby, but, no, ancient, new, guinea, singing, dog, remains, have, been, found, the, earliest, dingo, skeletal, remains, in, australia, are, estimated, at, 3, 450, ybp, from, the, mandura, caves, on, the, nullarbor, plain, south, eastern, western, australia, 3, 320, ybp, from, woombah, midden, near, woombah, new, south, wales, and, 3, 170, ybp, from, fromme, s, landing, on, the, murray, river, near, mannum, south, australia, dingo, bone, fragments, were, found, in, a, rock, shelter, located, at, mount, burr, south, australia, in, a, layer, that, was, originally, dated, 7, 000, 8, 500, ybp, excavations, later, indicated, that, the, levels, had, been, disturbed, and, the, dingo, remains, probably, moved, to, an, earlier, level, the, dating, of, these, early, australian, dingo, fossils, led, to, the, widely, held, belief, that, dingoes, first, arrived, in, australia, 4, 000, ybp, and, then, took, 500, years, to, disperse, around, the, continent, however, the, timing, of, these, skeletal, remains, was, based, on, the, dating, of, the, sediments, in, which, they, were, discovered, and, not, the, specimens, themselves, in, 2018, the, oldest, skeletal, bones, from, the, madura, caves, were, directly, carbon, dated, between, 3, 348, and, 3, 081, ybp, providing, firm, evidence, of, the, earliest, dingo, and, that, dingoes, arrived, later, than, had, previously, been, proposed, the, next, most, reliable, timing, is, based, on, desiccated, flesh, dated, 2, 200, ybp, from, thylacine, hole, 110, km, west, of, eucla, on, the, nullarbor, plain, southeastern, western, australia, when, dingoes, first, arrived, they, would, have, been, taken, up, by, indigenous, australians, who, then, provided, a, network, for, their, swift, transfer, around, the, continent, based, on, the, recorded, distribution, time, for, dogs, across, tasmania, and, cats, across, australia, once, indigenous, australians, had, acquired, them, the, dispersal, of, dingoes, from, their, point, of, landing, until, they, occupied, continental, australia, is, proposed, to, have, taken, only, 70, years, the, red, fox, is, estimated, to, have, dispersed, across, the, continent, in, only, 60, 80, years, at, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, maximum, and, the, associated, rise, in, sea, levels, tasmania, became, separated, from, the, australian, mainland, 12, 000, ybp, and, new, guinea, 6, 500, 8, 500, ybp, by, the, inundation, of, the, sahul, shelf, fossil, remains, in, australia, date, to, around, 3, 500, ybp, and, no, dingo, remains, have, been, uncovered, in, tasmania, so, the, dingo, is, estimated, to, have, arrived, in, australia, at, a, time, between, 3, 500, and, 12, 000, ybp, to, reach, australia, through, island, southeast, asia, even, at, the, lowest, sea, level, of, the, last, glacial, maximum, a, journey, of, at, least, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, over, open, sea, between, ancient, sunda, and, sahul, was, necessary, so, they, must, have, accompanied, humans, on, boats, whole, genome, sequencing, indicates, that, while, dogs, are, a, genetically, divergent, subspecies, of, the, grey, wolf, the, dog, is, not, a, descendant, of, the, extant, grey, wolf, rather, these, are, sister, taxa, which, share, a, common, ancestor, from, a, ghost, population, of, wolves, that, disappeared, at, the, end, of, the, late, pleistocene, the, dog, and, the, dingo, are, not, separate, species, the, dingo, and, the, basenji, are, basal, members, of, the, domestic, dog, clade, mitochondrial, genome, sequences, indicate, that, the, dingo, falls, within, the, domestic, dog, clade, and, that, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, is, genetically, closer, to, those, dingoes, that, live, in, southeastern, australia, than, to, those, that, live, in, the, northwest, the, dingo, and, new, guinea, singing, dog, lineage, can, be, traced, back, from, island, southeast, asia, to, mainland, southeast, asia, gene, flow, from, the, genetically, divergent, tibetan, wolf, forms, 2, of, the, dingo, s, genome, which, likely, represents, ancient, admixture, in, eastern, eurasia, by, the, close, of, the, last, ice, age, 11, 700, years, ago, five, ancestral, dog, lineages, had, diversified, from, each, other, with, one, of, these, being, represented, today, by, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, in, 2020, the, first, whole, genome, sequencing, of, the, dingo, and, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, was, undertaken, the, study, indicates, that, the, ancestral, lineage, of, the, dingo, new, guinea, singing, dog, clade, arose, in, southern, east, asia, migrated, through, island, southeast, asia, 9, 900, ybp, and, reached, australia, 8, 300, ybp, however, the, human, population, which, brought, them, remains, unknown, the, dingo, s, genome, indicates, that, it, was, once, a, domestic, dog, which, commenced, a, process, of, feralisation, since, its, arrival, 8, 300, years, ago, with, the, new, environment, leading, to, changes, in, those, genomic, regions, which, regulate, metabolism, neurodevelopment, and, reproduction, a, 2016, genetic, study, shows, that, the, lineage, of, those, dingoes, found, today, in, the, northwestern, part, of, the, australian, continent, split, from, the, lineage, of, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, and, southeastern, dingo, 8, 300, years, ago, followed, by, a, split, between, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, lineage, from, the, southeastern, dingo, lineage, 7, 800, years, ago, the, study, proposes, that, two, dingo, migrations, occurred, when, sea, levels, were, lower, and, australia, and, new, guinea, formed, one, landmass, named, sahul, that, existed, until, 6, 500, 8, 000, years, ago, whole, genome, analysis, of, the, dingo, indicates, there, are, three, sub, populations, which, exist, in, northeast, tropical, southeast, alpine, and, west, central, australia, desert, morphological, data, showing, the, dingo, skulls, from, southeastern, australia, alpine, dingoes, being, quite, distinct, from, the, other, ecotypes, and, genomic, and, mitochondrial, dna, sequencing, demonstrating, at, least, 2, dingo, mtdna, haplotypes, colonised, australia, in, 2020, a, genetic, study, found, that, the, new, guinea, highland, wild, dogs, were, genetically, basal, to, the, dingo, and, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, and, therefore, the, potential, originator, of, both, the, dingo, is, a, medium, sized, canid, with, a, lean, hardy, body, that, is, adapted, for, speed, agility, and, stamina, the, head, is, the, widest, part, of, the, body, wedge, shaped, and, large, in, proportion, to, the, body, captive, dingoes, are, longer, and, heavier, than, wild, dingoes, as, they, have, access, to, better, food, and, veterinary, care, the, average, wild, dingo, male, weighs, 15, 8, kg, 35, lb, and, the, female, 14, 1, kg, 31, lb, compared, with, the, captive, male, 18, 9, kg, 42, lb, and, the, female, 16, 2, kg, 36, lb, the, average, wild, dingo, male, length, is, 125, cm, 49, in, and, the, female, 122, cm, 48, in, compared, with, the, captive, male, 136, cm, 54, in, and, the, female, 133, cm, 52, in, the, average, wild, dingo, male, stands, at, the, shoulder, height, of, 59, cm, 23, in, and, the, female, 56, cm, 22, in, compared, with, the, captive, male, 56, cm, 22, in, and, the, female, 53, cm, 21, in, dingoes, rarely, carry, excess, fat, and, the, wild, ones, display, exposed, ribs, dingoes, from, northern, and, northwestern, australia, are, often, larger, than, those, found, in, central, and, southern, australia, the, dingo, is, similar, to, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, in, morphology, apart, from, the, dingo, s, greater, height, at, the, withers, the, average, dingo, can, reach, speeds, of, up, to, 60, kilometres, per, hour, compared, with, the, dog, the, dingo, is, able, to, rotate, its, wrists, and, can, turn, doorknobs, or, raise, latches, in, order, to, escape, confinement, dingo, shoulder, joints, are, unusually, flexible, and, they, can, climb, fences, cliffs, trees, and, rocks, these, adaptations, help, dingoes, climbing, in, difficult, terrain, where, they, prefer, high, vantage, points, a, similar, adaptation, can, be, found, in, the, norwegian, lundehund, which, was, developed, on, isolated, norwegian, islands, to, hunt, in, cliff, and, rocky, areas, wolves, do, not, have, this, ability, compared, with, the, skull, of, the, dog, the, dingo, possesses, a, longer, muzzle, longer, carnassial, teeth, longer, and, more, slender, canine, teeth, larger, auditory, bullae, a, flatter, cranium, with, a, larger, sagittal, crest, and, larger, nuchal, lines, in, 2014, a, study, was, conducted, on, pre, 20th, century, dingo, specimens, that, are, unlikely, to, have, been, influenced, by, later, hybridisation, the, dingo, skull, was, found, to, differ, relative, to, the, domestic, dog, by, its, larger, palatal, width, longer, rostrum, shorter, skull, height, and, wider, sagittal, crest, however, this, was, rebutted, with, the, figures, falling, within, the, wider, range, of, the, domestic, dog, and, that, each, dog, breed, differs, from, the, others, in, skull, measurements, based, on, a, comparison, with, the, remains, of, a, dingo, found, at, fromme, s, landing, the, dingo, s, skull, and, skeleton, have, not, changed, over, the, past, 3, 000, years, compared, to, the, wolf, the, dingo, possesses, a, paedomorphic, cranium, similar, to, domestic, dogs, however, the, dingo, has, a, larger, brain, size, compared, to, dogs, of, the, same, body, weight, with, the, dingo, being, more, comparable, with, the, wolf, than, dogs, are, in, this, respect, the, dingo, resembles, two, similar, mesopredators, the, dhole, and, the, coyote, the, eyes, are, triangular, or, almond, shaped, and, are, hazel, to, dark, in, colour, with, dark, rims, the, ears, are, erect, and, occur, high, on, the, skull, the, dingo, s, three, main, coat, colours, are, described, as, being, light, ginger, or, tan, black, and, tan, and, creamy, white, the, ginger, colour, ranges, from, a, deep, rust, to, a, pale, cream, and, can, be, found, in, 74, of, dingoes, often, small, white, markings, are, seen, on, the, tip, of, the, tail, the, feet, and, the, chest, but, with, no, large, white, patches, some, do, not, exhibit, white, tips, the, black, and, tan, dingoes, possess, a, black, coat, with, a, tan, muzzle, chest, belly, legs, and, feet, and, can, be, found, in, 12, of, dingoes, solid, white, can, be, found, in, 2, of, dingoes, and, solid, black, 1, only, three, genes, affect, coat, colour, in, the, dingo, compared, with, nine, genes, in, the, domestic, dog, the, ginger, colour, is, dominant, and, carries, the, other, three, main, colours, black, tan, and, white, white, dingoes, breed, true, and, black, and, tan, dingoes, breed, true, when, these, cross, the, result, is, a, sandy, colour, the, coat, is, not, oily, nor, does, it, have, a, dog, like, odour, the, dingo, has, a, single, coat, in, the, tropical, north, of, australia, and, a, double, thick, coat, in, the, cold, mountains, of, the, south, the, undercoat, being, a, wolf, grey, colour, patchy, and, brindle, coat, colours, can, be, found, in, dingoes, with, no, dog, ancestry, and, these, colours, are, less, common, in, dingoes, of, mixed, ancestry, the, dingo, s, tail, is, flattish, tapering, after, mid, length, and, does, not, curve, over, the, back, but, is, carried, low, when, walking, the, dingo, s, rear, foot, steps, in, line, with, the, front, foot, and, these, do, not, possess, dewclaws, dingoes, in, the, wild, live, 3, 5, years, with, few, living, past, 7, 8, years, some, have, been, recorded, living, up, to, 10, years, in, captivity, they, live, for, 14, 16, years, one, dingo, has, been, recorded, to, live, just, under, 20, years, the, wolf, like, canids, are, a, group, of, large, carnivores, that, are, genetically, closely, related, because, their, chromosomes, number, 78, therefore, they, can, potentially, interbreed, to, produce, fertile, hybrids, in, the, australian, wild, there, exist, dingoes, feral, dogs, and, the, crossings, of, these, two, which, produce, dingo, dog, hybrids, most, studies, looking, at, the, distribution, of, dingoes, focus, on, the, distribution, of, dingo, dog, hybrids, instead, dingoes, occurred, throughout, mainland, australia, before, european, settlement, they, are, not, found, in, the, fossil, record, of, tasmania, so, they, apparently, arrived, in, australia, after, tasmania, had, separated, from, the, mainland, due, to, rising, sea, levels, the, introduction, of, agriculture, reduced, dingo, distribution, and, by, the, early, 1900s, large, barrier, fences, including, the, dingo, fence, excluded, them, from, the, sheep, grazing, areas, land, clearance, poisoning, and, trapping, caused, the, extinction, of, the, dingo, and, hybrids, from, most, of, their, former, range, in, southern, queensland, new, south, wales, victoria, and, south, australia, today, they, are, absent, from, most, of, new, south, wales, victoria, the, southeastern, third, of, south, australia, and, the, southwestern, tip, of, western, australia, they, are, sparse, in, the, eastern, half, of, western, australia, and, the, adjoining, areas, of, the, northern, territory, and, south, australia, they, are, regarded, as, common, across, the, remainder, of, the, continent, the, dingo, could, be, considered, an, ecotype, or, an, ecospecies, that, has, adapted, to, australia, s, unique, environment, the, dingo, s, present, distribution, covers, a, variety, of, habitats, including, the, temperate, regions, of, eastern, australia, the, alpine, moorlands, of, the, eastern, highlands, the, arid, hot, deserts, of, central, australia, and, the, tropical, forests, and, wetlands, of, northern, australia, the, occupation, of, and, adaption, to, these, habitats, may, have, been, assisted, by, their, relationship, with, indigenous, australians, a, 20, year, study, of, the, dingo, s, diet, was, conducted, across, australia, by, the, federal, and, state, governments, these, examined, a, total, of, 13, 000, stomach, contents, and, fecal, samples, for, the, fecal, samples, determining, the, matching, tracks, of, foxes, and, feral, cats, was, possible, without, including, these, samples, in, the, study, but, in, distinguishing, between, the, tracks, left, by, dingoes, and, those, of, dingo, hybrids, or, feral, dogs, was, impossible, the, study, found, that, these, canines, prey, on, 177, species, represented, by, 72, 3, mammals, 71, species, 18, 8, birds, 53, species, 3, 3, vegetation, seeds, 1, 8, reptiles, 23, species, and, 3, 8, insects, fish, crabs, and, frogs, 28, species, the, relative, proportions, of, prey, are, much, the, same, across, australia, apart, from, more, birds, being, eaten, in, the, north, and, south, east, coastal, regions, and, more, lizards, in, central, australia, some, 80, of, the, diet, consisted, of, 10, species, red, kangaroo, swamp, wallaby, cattle, dusky, rat, magpie, goose, common, brushtail, possum, long, haired, rat, agile, wallaby, european, rabbit, and, common, wombat, of, the, mammals, eaten, 20, could, be, regarded, as, large, however, the, relative, proportions, of, the, size, of, prey, mammals, varied, across, regions, in, the, tropical, coast, region, of, northern, australia, agile, wallabies,

classes, with, 19, sound, types, have, been, identified, compared, to, most, domestic, dogs, the, bark, of, a, dingo, is, short, and, monosyllabic, and, is, rarely, used, barking, was, observed, to, make, up, only, 5, of, vocalisations, dog, barking, has, always, been, distinct, from, wolf, barking, australian, dingoes, bark, mainly, in, swooshing, noises, or, in, a, mixture, of, atonal, and, tonal, sounds, in, addition, barking, is, almost, exclusively, used, for, giving, warnings, warn, barking, in, a, homotypical, sequence, and, a, kind, of, warn, howling, in, a, heterotypical, sequence, have, also, been, observed, the, bark, howling, starts, with, several, barks, and, then, fades, into, a, rising, and, ebbing, howl, and, is, probably, similar, to, coughing, used, to, warn, the, puppies, and, members, of, the, pack, additionally, dingoes, emit, a, sort, of, wailing, sound, which, they, mostly, use, when, approaching, a, watering, hole, probably, to, warn, already, present, dingoes, according, to, the, present, state, of, knowledge, getting, australian, dingoes, to, bark, more, frequently, by, putting, them, in, contact, with, other, domestic, dogs, is, not, possible, however, german, zoologist, alfred, brehm, reported, a, dingo, that, learned, the, more, typical, form, of, barking, and, how, to, use, it, while, its, brother, did, not, whether, dingoes, bark, or, bark, howl, less, frequently, in, general, is, not, certain, dingoes, have, three, basic, forms, of, howling, moans, bark, howls, and, snuffs, with, at, least, 10, variations, usually, three, kinds, of, howls, are, distinguished, long, and, persistent, rising, and, ebbing, and, short, and, abrupt, observations, have, shown, that, each, kind, of, howling, has, several, variations, though, their, purpose, is, unknown, the, frequency, of, howling, varies, with, the, season, and, time, of, day, and, is, also, influenced, by, breeding, migration, lactation, social, stability, and, dispersal, behaviour, howling, can, be, more, frequent, in, times, of, food, shortage, because, the, dogs, become, more, widely, distributed, within, their, home, range, additionally, howling, seems, to, have, a, group, function, and, is, sometimes, an, expression, of, joy, for, example, greeting, howls, overall, howling, was, observed, less, frequently, in, dingoes, than, among, grey, wolves, it, may, happen, that, one, dog, will, begin, to, howl, and, several, or, all, other, dogs, will, howl, back, and, bark, from, time, to, time, in, the, wilderness, dingoes, howl, over, long, distances, to, attract, other, members, of, the, pack, to, find, other, dogs, or, to, keep, intruders, at, bay, dingoes, howl, in, chorus, with, significant, pitches, and, with, increasing, number, of, pack, members, the, variability, of, pitches, also, increases, therefore, dingoes, are, suspected, to, be, able, to, measure, the, size, of, a, pack, without, visual, contact, moreover, their, highly, variable, chorus, howls, have, been, proposed, to, generate, a, confounding, effect, in, the, receivers, by, making, pack, size, appear, larger, growling, making, up, about, 65, of, the, vocalisations, is, used, in, an, agonistic, context, for, dominance, and, as, a, defensive, sound, similar, to, many, domestic, dogs, a, reactive, usage, of, defensive, growling, is, only, rarely, observed, growling, very, often, occurs, in, combination, with, other, sounds, and, has, been, observed, almost, exclusively, in, swooshing, noises, similar, to, barking, during, observations, in, germany, dingoes, were, heard, to, produce, a, sound, that, observers, have, called, schrappen, it, was, only, observed, in, an, agonistic, context, mostly, as, a, defence, against, obtrusive, pups, or, for, defending, resources, it, was, described, as, a, bite, intention, during, which, the, receiver, is, never, touched, or, hurt, only, a, clashing, of, the, teeth, could, be, heard, aside, from, vocal, communication, dingoes, communicate, like, all, domestic, dogs, via, scent, marking, specific, objects, for, example, spinifex, or, places, such, as, waters, trails, and, hunting, grounds, using, chemical, signals, from, their, urine, feces, and, scent, glands, males, scent, mark, more, frequently, than, females, especially, during, the, mating, season, they, also, scent, rub, whereby, a, dog, rolls, its, neck, shoulders, or, back, on, something, that, is, usually, associated, with, food, or, the, scent, markings, of, other, dogs, unlike, wolves, dingoes, can, react, to, social, cues, and, gestures, from, humans, dingoes, tend, to, be, nocturnal, in, warmer, regions, but, less, so, in, cooler, areas, their, main, period, of, activity, is, around, dusk, and, dawn, making, them, a, crepuscular, species, in, the, colder, climates, the, periods, of, activity, are, short, often, less, than, 1, hour, with, short, times, of, resting, dingoes, have, two, kinds, of, movement, a, searching, movement, apparently, associated, with, hunting, and, an, exploratory, movement, probably, for, contact, and, communication, with, other, dogs, according, to, studies, in, queensland, the, wild, dogs, dingo, hybrids, there, move, freely, at, night, through, urban, areas, and, cross, streets, and, seem, to, get, along, quite, well, the, dingo, s, social, behaviour, is, about, as, flexible, as, that, of, a, coyote, or, grey, wolf, which, is, perhaps, one, of, the, reasons, the, dingo, was, originally, believed, to, have, descended, from, the, indian, wolf, while, young, males, are, often, solitary, and, nomadic, in, nature, breeding, adults, often, form, a, settled, pack, however, in, areas, of, the, dingo, s, habitat, with, a, widely, spaced, population, breeding, pairs, remain, together, apart, from, others, dingo, distributions, are, a, single, dingo, 73, two, dingoes, 16, three, dingoes, 5, four, dingoes, 3, and, packs, of, five, to, seven, dingoes, 3, a, dingo, pack, usually, consists, of, a, mated, pair, their, offspring, from, the, current, year, and, sometimes, offspring, from, the, previous, year, where, conditions, are, favourable, among, dingo, packs, the, pack, is, stable, with, a, distinct, territory, and, little, overlap, between, neighbours, the, size, of, packs, often, appears, to, correspond, to, the, size, of, prey, available, in, the, pack, s, territory, desert, areas, have, smaller, groups, of, dingoes, with, a, more, loose, territorial, behaviour, and, sharing, of, the, water, sites, the, average, monthly, pack, size, was, noted, to, be, between, three, and, 12, members, similar, to, other, canids, a, dingo, pack, largely, consists, of, a, mated, pair, their, current, year, s, offspring, and, occasionally, a, previous, year, s, offspring, dominance, hierarchies, exist, both, between, and, within, males, and, females, with, males, usually, being, more, dominant, than, females, however, a, few, exceptions, have, been, noted, in, captive, packs, during, travel, while, eating, prey, or, when, approaching, a, water, source, for, the, first, time, the, breeding, male, will, be, seen, as, the, leader, or, alpha, subordinate, dingoes, approach, a, more, dominant, dog, in, a, slightly, crouched, posture, ears, flat, and, tail, down, to, ensure, peace, in, the, pack, establishment, of, artificial, packs, in, captive, dingoes, has, failed, dingoes, breed, once, annually, depending, on, the, estrous, cycle, of, the, females, which, according, to, most, sources, only, come, in, heat, once, per, year, dingo, females, can, come, in, heat, twice, per, year, but, can, only, be, pregnant, once, a, year, with, the, second, time, only, seeming, to, be, pregnant, males, are, virile, throughout, the, year, in, most, regions, but, have, a, lower, sperm, production, during, the, summer, in, most, cases, during, studies, on, dingoes, from, the, eastern, highlands, and, central, australia, in, captivity, no, specific, breeding, cycle, could, be, observed, all, were, potent, throughout, the, year, the, breeding, was, only, regulated, by, the, heat, of, the, females, a, rise, in, testosterone, was, observed, in, the, males, during, the, breeding, season, but, this, was, attributed, to, the, heat, of, the, females, and, copulation, in, contrast, to, the, captive, dingoes, captured, dingo, males, from, central, australia, did, show, evidence, of, a, male, breeding, cycle, those, dingoes, showed, no, interest, in, females, in, heat, this, time, other, domestic, dogs, outside, the, mating, season, january, to, july, and, did, not, breed, with, them, the, mating, season, usually, occurs, in, australia, between, march, and, may, according, to, other, sources, between, april, and, june, during, this, time, dingoes, may, actively, defend, their, territories, using, vocalisations, dominance, behaviour, growling, and, barking, most, females, in, the, wild, start, breeding, at, the, age, of, 2, years, within, packs, the, alpha, female, tends, to, go, into, heat, before, subordinates, and, actively, suppresses, mating, attempts, by, other, females, males, become, sexually, mature, between, the, ages, of, 1, and, 3, years, the, precise, start, of, breeding, varies, depending, on, age, social, status, geographic, range, and, seasonal, conditions, among, dingoes, in, captivity, the, pre, estrus, was, observed, to, last, 10, 12, days, however, the, pre, estrus, may, last, as, long, as, 60, days, in, the, wild, in, general, the, only, dingoes, in, a, pack, that, successfully, breed, are, the, alpha, pair, and, the, other, pack, members, help, with, raising, the, pups, subordinates, are, actively, prevented, from, breeding, by, the, alpha, pair, and, some, subordinate, females, have, a, false, pregnancy, low, ranking, or, solitary, dingoes, can, successfully, breed, if, the, pack, structure, breaks, up, the, gestation, period, lasts, for, 61, 69, days, and, the, size, of, the, litter, can, range, from, 1, to, 10, usually, 5, pups, with, the, number, of, males, born, tending, to, be, higher, than, that, of, females, pups, of, subordinate, females, usually, get, killed, by, the, alpha, female, which, causes, the, population, increase, to, be, low, even, in, good, times, this, behaviour, possibly, developed, as, an, adaptation, to, the, fluctuating, environmental, conditions, in, australia, pups, are, usually, born, between, may, and, august, the, winter, period, but, in, tropical, regions, breeding, can, occur, at, any, time, of, the, year, at, the, age, of, 3, weeks, the, pups, leave, the, den, for, the, first, time, and, leave, it, completely, at, 8, weeks, dens, are, mostly, underground, reports, exist, of, dens, in, abandoned, rabbit, burrows, rock, formations, under, boulders, in, dry, creeks, under, large, spinifex, in, hollow, logs, and, augmented, burrows, of, monitor, lizards, and, wombat, burrows, the, pups, usually, stray, around, the, den, within, a, radius, of, 3, km, 2, mi, and, are, accompanied, by, older, dogs, during, longer, travels, the, transition, to, consuming, solid, food, is, normally, accomplished, by, all, members, of, the, pack, during, the, age, of, 9, to, 12, weeks, apart, from, their, own, experiences, pups, also, learn, through, observation, young, dingoes, usually, become, independent, at, the, age, of, 3, 6, months, or, they, disperse, at, the, age, of, 10, months, when, the, next, mating, season, starts, dingoes, usually, remain, in, one, area, and, do, not, undergo, seasonal, migrations, however, during, times, of, famine, even, in, normally, safe, areas, dingoes, travel, into, pastoral, areas, where, intensive, human, induced, control, measures, are, undertaken, in, western, australia, in, the, 1970s, young, dogs, were, found, to, travel, for, long, distances, when, necessary, about, 10, of, the, dogs, captured, all, younger, than, 12, months, were, later, recaptured, far, away, from, their, first, location, among, these, the, average, travelled, distance, for, males, was, 21, 7, km, 13, 5, mi, and, for, females, 11, km, 7, mi, therefore, travelling, dingoes, had, lower, chances, of, survival, in, foreign, territories, and, they, are, apparently, unlikely, to, survive, long, migrations, through, occupied, territories, the, rarity, of, long, migration, routes, seemed, to, confirm, this, during, investigations, in, the, nullarbor, plain, even, longer, migration, routes, were, recorded, the, longest, recorded, migration, route, of, a, radio, collared, dingo, was, about, 24, 32, km, 15, 20, mi, dingoes, generally, avoid, conflict, with, humans, but, they, are, large, enough, to, be, dangerous, most, attacks, involve, people, feeding, wild, dingoes, particularly, on, k, gari, formerly, fraser, island, which, is, a, special, centre, of, dingo, related, tourism, the, vast, majority, of, dingo, attacks, are, minor, in, nature, but, some, can, be, major, and, a, few, have, been, fatal, the, death, of, two, month, old, azaria, chamberlain, in, the, northern, territory, in, 1980, is, one, of, them, many, australian, national, parks, have, signs, advising, visitors, not, to, feed, wildlife, partly, because, this, practice, is, not, healthy, for, the, animals, and, partly, because, it, may, encourage, undesirable, behaviour, such, as, snatching, or, biting, by, dingoes, kangaroos, goannas, and, some, birds, some, researchers, propose, that, the, dingo, caused, the, extirpation, of, the, thylacine, the, tasmanian, devil, and, the, tasmanian, native, hen, from, mainland, australia, because, of, the, correlation, in, space, and, time, with, the, dingo, s, arrival, recent, studies, have, questioned, this, proposal, suggesting, that, climate, change, and, increasing, human, populations, may, have, been, the, cause, dingoes, do, not, seem, to, have, had, the, same, ecological, impact, that, the, red, fox, have, in, modern, times, this, might, be, connected, to, the, dingo, s, way, of, hunting, and, the, size, of, their, favoured, prey, as, well, as, to, the, low, number, of, dingoes, in, the, time, before, european, colonisation, in, 2017, a, genetic, study, found, that, the, population, of, the, northwestern, dingoes, had, commenced, expanding, since, 4, 000, 6, 000, years, ago, this, was, proposed, to, be, due, either, to, their, first, arrival, in, australia, or, to, the, commencement, of, the, extinction, of, the, thylacine, with, the, dingo, expanding, into, the, thylacine, s, former, range, the, first, british, colonists, who, settled, at, port, jackson, in, 1788, recorded, the, dingo, living, with, indigenous, australians, and, later, at, melville, island, in, 1818, furthermore, they, were, noted, at, the, lower, darling, and, murray, rivers, in, 1862, indicating, that, the, dingo, was, possibly, semi, domesticated, or, at, least, utilised, in, a, symbiotic, manner, by, aboriginal, australians, when, livestock, farming, began, expanding, across, australia, in, the, early, 19th, century, dingoes, began, preying, on, sheep, and, cattle, numerous, population, control, measures, have, been, implemented, since, then, including, a, nation, wide, fencing, project, with, only, limited, success, dingoes, can, be, tame, when, they, come, in, frequent, contact, with, humans, furthermore, some, dingoes, live, with, humans, many, indigenous, australians, and, early, european, settlers, lived, alongside, dingoes, indigenous, australians, would, take, dingo, pups, from, the, den, and, tame, them, until, sexual, maturity, and, the, dogs, would, leave, according, to, david, jenkins, a, research, fellow, at, charles, sturt, university, the, breeding, and, reintroduction, of, pure, dingoes, is, no, easy, option, and, as, of, 2007, there, were, no, studies, that, seriously, dealt, with, this, topic, especially, in, areas, where, dingo, populations, are, already, present, much, of, the, present, place, of, wild, dogs, in, the, australian, ecosystem, especially, in, the, urban, areas, remains, unknown, although, the, ecological, role, of, dingoes, in, northern, and, central, australia, is, well, understood, the, same, does, not, apply, to, the, role, of, wild, dogs, in, the, east, of, the, continent, in, contrast, to, some, claims, dingoes, are, assumed, to, have, a, positive, impact, on, biodiversity, in, areas, where, feral, foxes, are, present, dingoes, are, regarded, as, apex, predators, and, possibly, perform, an, ecological, key, function, likely, with, increasing, evidence, from, scientific, research, they, control, the, diversity, of, the, ecosystem, by, limiting, the, number, of, prey, and, keeping, the, competition, in, check, wild, dogs, hunt, feral, livestock, such, as, goats, and, pigs, as, well, as, native, prey, and, introduced, animals, the, low, number, of, feral, goats, in, northern, australia, is, possibly, caused, by, the, presence, of, the, dingoes, but, whether, they, control, the, goats, numbers, is, still, disputable, studies, from, 1995, in, the, northern, wet, forests, of, australia, found, the, dingoes, there, did, not, reduce, the, number, of, feral, pigs, but, their, predation, only, affects, the, pig, population, together, with, the, presence, of, water, buffaloes, which, hinder, the, pigs, access, to, food, observations, concerning, the, mutual, impact, of, dingoes, and, red, fox, and, cat, populations, suggest, dingoes, limit, the, access, of, foxes, and, cats, to, certain, resources, as, a, result, a, disappearance, of, the, dingoes, may, cause, an, increase, of, red, fox, and, feral, cat, numbers, and, therefore, a, higher, pressure, on, native, animals, these, studies, found, the, presence, of, dingoes, is, one, of, the, factors, that, keep, fox, numbers, in, an, area, low, and, therefore, reduces, pressure, on, native, animals, which, then, do, not, disappear, from, the, area, the, countrywide, numbers, of, red, foxes, are, especially, high, where, dingo, numbers, are, low, but, other, factors, might, be, responsible, for, this, depending, on, the, area, evidence, was, found, for, a, competition, between, wild, dogs, and, red, foxes, in, the, blue, mountains, of, new, south, wales, since, many, overlaps, occurred, in, the, spectrum, of, preferred, prey, but, only, evidence, for, local, competition, not, on, a, grand, scale, was, found, also, dingoes, can, live, with, red, foxes, and, feral, cats, without, reducing, their, numbers, in, areas, with, sufficient, food, resources, for, example, high, rabbit, numbers, and, hiding, places, nearly, nothing, is, known, about, the, relationship, of, wild, dogs, and, feral, cats, except, both, mostly, live, in, the, same, areas, although, wild, dogs, also, eat, cats, whether, this, affects, the, cat, populations, is, not, known, additionally, the, disappearance, of, dingoes, might, increase, the, prevalence, of, kangaroo, rabbit, and, australian, brushturkey, numbers, in, the, areas, outside, the, dingo, fence, the, number, of, emus, is, lower, than, in, the, areas, inside, however, the, numbers, changed, depending, on, the, habitat, since, the, environment, is, the, same, on, both, sides, of, the, fence, the, dingo, was, assumed, to, be, a, strong, factor, for, the, regulation, of, these, species, therefore, some, people, demand, that, dingo, numbers, should, be, allowed, to, increase, or, dingoes, should, be, reintroduced, in, areas, with, low, dingo, populations, to, lower, the, pressure, on, endangered, populations, of, native, species, and, to, reintroduce, them, in, certain, areas, in, addition, the, presence, of, the, australian, brushturkey, in, queensland, increased, significantly, after, dingo, baiting, was, conducted, the, dingo, s, habitat, covers, most, of, australia, but, they, are, absent, in, the, southeast, and, tasmania, and, an, area, in, the, southwest, see, map, as, australia, s, largest, extant, terrestrial, predators, dingoes, prey, on, mammals, up, to, the, size, of, the, large, red, kangaroo, in, addition, to, the, grey, kangaroo, wombat, wallaby, quoll, possum, and, most, other, marsupials, they, frequently, pursue, birds, lizards, fish, crabs, crayfish, eels, snakes, frogs, young, crocodiles, larger, insects, snails, carrion, human, refuse, and, sometimes, fallen, fruits, or, seeds, dingoes, can, also, be, of, potential, benefit, to, their, environment, as, they, will, hunt, australia, s, many, introduced, and, invasive, species, this, includes, human, introduced, animals, such, as, deer, and, their, offspring, sambar, chital, and, red, deer, and, water, buffalo, in, addition, to, the, highly, invasive, rabbits, red, foxes, feral, and, domestic, cats, some, feral, dogs, sheep, and, calves, rarely, a, pack, of, dingoes, will, pursue, the, larger, and, more, dangerous, dromedary, camel, feral, donkey, or, feral, horse, unattended, young, animals, or, sick, weak, or, elderly, individuals, are, at, greatest, risk, cultural, opinions, about, the, dingo, are, often, based, on, its, perceived, cunning, and, the, idea, that, it, is, an, intermediate, between, civilisation, and, wildness, some, of, the, early, european, settlers, looked, on, dingoes, as, domestic, dogs, while, others, thought, they, were, more, like, wolves, over, the, years, dingoes, began, to, attack, sheep, and, their, relationship, to, the, europeans, changed, very, quickly, they, were, regarded, as, devious, and, cowardly, since, they, did, not, fight, bravely, in, the, eyes, of, the, europeans, and, vanished, into, the, bush, additionally, they, were, seen, as, promiscuous, or, as, devils, with, a, venomous, bite, or, saliva, so, they, could, be, killed, unreservedly, over, the, years, dingo, trappers, gained, some, prestige, for, their, work, especially, when, they, managed, to, kill, hard, to, catch, dingoes, dingoes, were, associated, with, thieves, vagabonds, bushrangers, and, parliamentary, opponents, from, the, 1960s, politicians, began, calling, their, opponents, dingo, meaning, they, were, cowardly, and, treacherous, and, it, has, become, a, popular, form, of, attack, since, then, today, the, word, dingo, still, stands, for, coward, and, cheat, with, verb, and, adjective, forms, used, as, well, the, image, of, the, dingo, has, ranged, among, some, groups, from, the, instructive, to, the, demonic, ceremonies, like, a, keen, at, the, cape, york, peninsula, in, the, form, of, howling, and, dreamtime, stories, are, connected, to, the, dingo, which, were, passed, down, through, the, generations, the, dingo, plays, a, prominent, role, in, the, dreamtime, stories, of, indigenous, australians, but, it, is, rarely, depicted, in, their, cave, paintings, when, compared, with, the, extinct, thylacine, one, of, the, tribal, elders, of, the, people, of, the, yarralin, northern, territory, region, tells, that, the, dreamtime, dingo, is, the, ancestor, of, both, dingoes, and, humans, the, dingoes, are, what, we, would, be, if, we, were, not, what, we, are, similar, to, how, europeans, acquired, dingoes, the, aboriginal, people, of, australia, acquired, dogs, from, the, immigrants, very, quickly, this, process, was, so, fast, that, francis, barrallier, surveyor, on, early, expeditions, around, the, colony, at, port, jackson, discovered, in, 1802, that, five, dogs, of, european, origin, were, there, before, him, one, theory, holds, that, other, domestic, dogs, adopt, the, role, of, the, pure, dingo, introduced, animals, such, as, the, water, buffalo, and, the, domestic, cat, have, been, adopted, into, the, indigenous, aboriginal, culture, in, the, forms, of, rituals, traditional, paintings, and, dreamtime, stories, most, of, the, published, myths, originate, from, the, western, desert, and, show, a, remarkable, complexity, in, some, stories, dingoes, are, the, central, characters, while, in, others, they, are, only, minor, ones, one, time, an, ancestor, from, the, dreamtime, created, humans, and, dingoes, or, gave, them, their, current, shape, stories, mention, creation, socially, acceptable, behaviour, and, explanations, why, some, things, are, the, way, they, are, myths, exist, about, shapeshifters, human, to, dingo, or, vice, versa, dingo, people, and, the, creation, of, certain, landscapes, or, elements, of, those, landscapes, like, waterholes, or, mountains, livestock, farming, expanded, across, australia, from, the, early, 1800s, which, led, to, conflict, between, the, dingo, and, graziers, sheep, and, to, a, lesser, extent, cattle, are, an, easy, target, for, dingoes, the, pastoralists, and, the, government, bodies, that, support, this, industry, have, shot, trapped, and, poisoned, dingoes, or, destroyed, dingo, pups, in, their, dens, after, two, centuries, of, persecution, the, dingo, or, dingo, dog, hybrids, can, still, be, found, across, most, of, the, continent, research, on, the, real, extent, of, the, damage, and, the, reason, for, this, problem, only, started, recently, livestock, can, die, from, many, causes, and, when, the, carcass, is, found, determining, with, certainty, the, cause, of, death, is, often, difficult, since, the, outcome, of, an, attack, on, livestock, depends, to, a, high, degree, on, the, behaviour, and, experience, of, the, predator, and, the, prey, only, direct, observation, is, certain, to, determine, whether, an, attack, was, by, dingoes, or, other, domestic, dogs, even, the, existence, of, remnants, of, the, prey, in, the, scat, of, wild, dogs, does, not, prove, they, are, pests, since, wild, dogs, also, eat, carrion, the, cattle, industry, can, tolerate, low, to, moderate, and, sometimes, high, numbers, of, wild, dogs, therefore, dingoes, are, not, so, easily, regarded, as, pests, in, these, areas, in, the, case, of, sheep, and, goats, a, zero, tolerance, attitude, is, common, the, biggest, threats, are, dogs, that, live, inside, or, near, the, paddock, areas, the, extent, of, sheep, loss, is, hard, to, determine, due, to, the, wide, pasture, lands, in, some, parts, of, australia, in, 2006, cattle, losses, in, the, northern, territory, rangeland, grazing, areas, were, estimated, to, be, up, to, 30, therefore, factors, such, as, availability, of, native, prey, as, well, as, the, defending, behaviour, and, health, of, the, cattle, play, an, important, role, in, the, number, of, losses, a, study, in, central, australia, in, 2003, confirmed, that, dingoes, only, have, a, low, impact, on, cattle, numbers, when, a, sufficient, supply, of, other, prey, such, as, kangaroos, and, rabbits, is, available, in, some, parts, of, australia, the, loss, of, calves, is, assumed, to, be, minimised, if, horned, cattle, are, used, instead, of, polled, the, precise, economic, impact, is, not, known, and, the, rescue, of, some, calves, is, unlikely, to, compensate, for, the, necessary, costs, of, control, measures, calves, usually, suffer, less, lethal, wounds, than, sheep, due, to, their, size, and, the, protection, by, adult, cattle, so, they, have, a, higher, chance, of, surviving, an, attack, as, a, result, the, evidence, of, a, dog, attack, may, only, be, discovered, after, the, cattle, have, been, herded, back, into, the, enclosure, and, signs, such, as, bitten, ears, tails, and, other, wounds, are, discovered, the, opinions, of, cattle, owners, regarding, dingoes, are, more, variable, than, those, of, sheep, owners, some, cattle, owners, believe, that, the, weakened, mother, losing, her, calf, is, better, in, times, of, drought, so, that, she, does, not, have, to, care, for, her, calf, too, therefore, these, owners, are, more, hesitant, to, kill, dingoes, the, cattle, industry, may, benefit, from, the, predation, of, dingoes, on, rabbits, kangaroos, and, rats, furthermore, the, mortality, rate, of, calves, has, many, possible, causes, and, discriminating, between, them, is, difficult, the, only, reliable, method, to, assess, the, damage, would, be, to, document, all, pregnant, cows, then, observe, their, development, and, those, of, their, calves, the, loss, of, calves, in, observed, areas, where, dingoes, were, controlled, was, higher, than, in, other, areas, loss, of, livestock, is, therefore, not, necessarily, caused, by, the, occurrence, of, dingoes, and, is, independent, from, wild, dogs, one, researcher, has, stated, that, for, cattle, stations, where, dingoes, were, controlled, kangaroos, were, abundant, and, this, affects, the, availability, of, grass, domestic, dogs, are, the, only, terrestrial, predators, in, australia, that, are, big, enough, to, kill, fully, grown, sheep, and, only, a, few, sheep, manage, to, recover, from, the, severe, injuries, in, the, case, of, lambs, death, can, have, many, causes, apart, from, attacks, by, predators, which, are, blamed, for, the, deaths, because, they, eat, from, the, carcasses, although, attacks, by, red, foxes, are, possible, such, attacks, are, more, rare, than, previously, thought, the, fact, that, the, sheep, and, goat, industry, is, much, more, susceptible, to, damage, caused, by, wild, dogs, than, the, cattle, industry, is, mostly, due, to, two, factors, the, flight, behaviour, of, the, sheep, and, their, tendency, to, flock, together, in, the, face, of, danger, and, the, hunting, methods, of, wild, dogs, along, with, their, efficient, way, of, handling, goats, and, sheep, therefore, the, damage, to, the, livestock, industry, does, not, correlate, to, the, numbers, of, wild, dogs, in, an, area, except, that, no, damage, occurs, where, no, wild, dogs, occur, according, to, a, report, from, the, government, of, queensland, wild, dogs, cost, the, state, about, 30, million, annually, due, to, livestock, losses, the, spread, of, diseases, and, control, measures, losses, for, the, livestock, industry, alone, were, estimated, to, be, as, high, as, 18, million, in, barcaldine, queensland, up, to, one, fifth, of, all, sheep, are, killed, by, dingoes, annually, a, situation, which, has, been, described, as, an, epidemic, according, to, a, survey, among, cattle, owners, in, 1995, performed, by, the, park, and, wildlife, service, owners, estimated, their, annual, losses, due, to, wild, dogs, depending, on, the, district, to, be, from, 1, 6, to, 7, 1, in, 2018, a, study, in, northern, south, australia, indicates, that, fetal, calf, loss, averages, 18, 6, with, no, significant, reduction, due, to, dingo, baiting, the, calf, losses, did, not, correlate, with, increased, dingo, activity, and, the, cattle, diseases, pestivirus, and, leptospirosis, were, a, major, cause, dingoes, then, scavenged, on, the, carcasses, there, was, also, evidence, of, dingo, predation, on, calves, among, the, indigenous, australians, dingoes, were, also, used, as, hunting, aids, living, hot, water, bottles, and, camp, dogs, their, scalps, were, used, as, a, kind, of, currency, their, teeth, were, traditionally, used, for, decorative, purposes, and, their, fur, for, traditional, costumes, sometimes, pure, dingoes, are, important, for, tourism, when, they, are, used, to, attract, visitors, however, this, seems, to, be, common, only, on, fraser, island, where, the, dingoes, are, extensively, used, as, a, symbol, to, enhance, the, attraction, of, the, island, tourists, are, drawn, to, the, experience, of, personally, interacting, with, dingoes, pictures, of, dingoes, appear, on, brochures, many, websites, and, postcards, advertising, the, island, the, dingo, is, recognised, as, a, native, animal, under, the, laws, of, all, australian, jurisdictions, australia, has, over, 500, national, parks, of, which, all, but, six, are, managed, by, the, states, and, territories, as, of, 2017, the, legal, status, of, the, dingo, varies, between, these, jurisdictions, and, in, some, instances, it, varies, between, different, regions, of, a, single, jurisdiction, as, of, 2008, some, of, these, jurisdictions, classify, dingoes, as, an, invasive, native, dingo, attacks, on, livestock, led, to, widescale, efforts, to, repel, them, from, areas, with, intensive, agricultural, usage, and, all, states, and, territories, have, enacted, laws, for, the, control, of, dingoes, in, the, early, 20th, century, fences, were, erected, to, keep, dingoes, away, from, areas, frequented, by, sheep, and, a, tendency, to, routinely, eradicate, dingoes, developed, among, some, livestock, owners, established, methods, for, the, control, of, dingoes, in, sheep, areas, entailed, the, employment, of, specific, workers, on, every, property, the, job, of, these, people, who, were, nicknamed, doggers, was, to, reduce, the, number, of, dingoes, by, using, steel, traps, baits, firearms, and, other, methods, the, responsibility, for, the, control, of, wild, dogs, lay, solely, in, the, hands, of, the, landowners, at, the, same, time, the, government, was, forced, to, control, the, number, of, dingoes, as, a, result, a, number, of, measures, for, the, control, of, dingoes, developed, over, time, it, was, also, considered, that, dingoes, travel, over, long, distances, to, reach, areas, with, richer, prey, populations, and, the, control, methods, were, often, concentrated, along, paths, or, trails, and, in, areas, that, were, far, away, from, sheep, areas, all, dingoes, were, regarded, as, a, potential, danger, and, were, hunted, apart, from, the, introduction, of, the, poison, 1080, extensively, used, for, 40, years, and, nicknamed, doggone, the, methods, and, strategies, for, controlling, wild, dogs, have, changed, little, over, time, information, concerning, cultural, importance, to, indigenous, people, and, the, importance, of, dingoes, and, the, impact, of, control, measures, on, other, species, is, also, lacking, in, some, areas, historically, the, attitudes, and, needs, of, indigenous, people, were, not, taken, into, account, when, dingoes, were, controlled, other, factors, that, might, be, taken, into, account, are, the, genetic, status, degree, of, interbreeding, of, dingoes, in, these, areas, ownership, and, land, usage, as, well, as, a, reduction, of, killing, measures, to, areas, outside, the, zones, however, most, control, measures, and, the, appropriate, studies, are, there, to, minimise, the, loss, of, livestock, and, not, to, protect, dingoes, increasing, pressure, from, environmentalists, against, the, random, killing, of, dingoes, as, well, as, the, impact, on, other, animals, demanded, that, more, information, needed, to, be, gathered, to, prove, the, necessity, of, control, measures, and, to, disprove, the, claim, of, unnecessary, killings, today, permanent, population, control, is, regarded, as, necessary, to, reduce, the, impact, of, all, wild, dogs, and, to, ensure, the, survival, of, the, pure, dingo, in, the, wild, to, protect, livestock, livestock, guardian, dogs, for, example, maremmas, donkeys, alpacas, and, llamas, are, used, in, the, 1920s, the, dingo, fence, was, erected, on, the, basis, of, the, wild, dog, act, 1921, and, until, 1931, thousands, of, miles, of, dingo, fences, had, been, erected, in, several, areas, of, south, australia, in, the, year, 1946, these, efforts, were, directed, to, a, single, goal, and, the, dingo, fence, was, finally, completed, the, fence, connected, with, other, fences, in, new, south, wales, and, queensland, the, main, responsibilities, in, maintaining, the, dingo, fence, still, lies, with, the, landowners, whose, properties, border, on, the, fence, and, who, receive, financial, support, from, the, government, a, reward, system, local, as, well, from, the, government, was, active, from, 1846, to, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, despite, the, billions, of, dollars, spent, it, was, ever, an, efficient, control, method, therefore, its, importance, declined, over, time, dingo, scalping, commenced, in, 1912, with, the, passage, of, the, wild, dogs, act, by, the, government, of, south, australia, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, depredation, on, livestock, that, government, offered, a, bounty, for, dingo, skins, and, this, program, was, later, repeated, in, western, australia, and, the, northern, territory, one, writer, argues, that, this, new, legislation, and, economic, driver, had, significant, impacts, on, aboriginal, society, in, the, region, this, act, was, followed, by, updates, and, amendments, including, 1931, 1938, and, 1948, baits, with, the, poison, 1080, are, regarded, as, the, fastest, and, safest, method, for, dog, control, since, they, are, extremely, susceptible, even, small, amounts, of, poison, per, dog, are, sufficient, 0, 3, mg, per, kg, the, application, of, aerial, baiting, is, regulated, in, the, commonwealth, by, the, civil, aviation, regulations, 1988, the, assumption, that, the, tiger, quoll, might, be, damaged, by, the, poison, led, to, the, dwindling, of, areas, where, aerial, baiting, could, be, performed, in, areas, where, aerial, baiting, is, no, longer, possible, it, is, necessary, to, put, down, baits, from, 2004, cyanide, ejectors, and, protection, collars, filled, with, 1080, on, certain, spots, have, been, tested, in, 2016, controversy, surrounded, a, plan, to, inject, a, population, of, dingoes, on, pelorus, island, off, the, coast, of, northern, queensland, australia, with, pills, that, would, release, a, fatal, dose, of, 1080, poison, two, years, after, the, dingoes, were, to, be, intentionally, released, to, help, eradicate, goats, the, dingoes, were, dubbed, death, row, dingoes, and, the, plan, was, blocked, due, to, concerns, for, a, locally, threatened, shorebird, owners, of, dingoes, and, other, domestic, dogs, are, sometimes, asked, to, neuter, their, pets, and, keep, them, under, observation, to, reduce, the, number, of, stray, feral, dogs, and, prevent, interbreeding, with, dingoes, the, efficiency, of, control, measures, was, questioned, in, the, past, and, is, often, questioned, today, as, well, as, whether, they, stand, in, a, good, cost, benefit, ratio, the, premium, system, proved, to, be, susceptible, to, deception, and, to, be, useless, on, a, large, scale, and, can, therefore, only, be, used, for, getting, rid, of, problem, dogs, animal, traps, are, considered, inhumane, and, inefficient, on, a, large, scale, due, to, the, limited, efficacy, of, baits, based, on, studies, it, is, assumed, that, only, young, dogs, that, would, have, died, anyway, can, be, captured, furthermore, wild, dogs, are, capable, of, learning, and, sometimes, are, able, to, detect, and, avoid, traps, quite, efficiently, in, one, case, a, dingo, bitch, followed, a, dogger, and, triggered, his, traps, one, after, another, by, carefully, pushing, her, paw, through, the, sand, that, covered, the, trap, poisonous, baits, can, be, very, effective, when, they, are, of, good, meat, quality, however, they, do, not, last, long, and, are, occasionally, taken, by, red, foxes, quolls, ants, and, birds, aerial, baiting, can, nearly, eliminate, whole, dingo, populations, livestock, guardian, dogs, can, effectively, minimise, livestock, losses, but, are, less, effective, on, wide, open, areas, with, widely, distributed, livestock, furthermore, they, can, be, a, danger, to, the, livestock, or, be, killed, by, control, measures, themselves, when, they, are, not, sufficiently, supervised, by, their, owners, fences, are, reliable, in, keeping, wild, dogs, from, entering, certain, areas, but, they, are, expensive, to, build, need, permanent, maintenance, and, only, cause, the, problem, to, be, relocated, control, measures, mostly, result, in, smaller, packs, and, a, disruption, of, pack, structure, the, measures, seem, to, be, rather, detrimental, to, the, livestock, industry, because, the, empty, territories, are, taken, over, by, young, dogs, and, the, predation, then, increases, nonetheless, it, is, regarded, as, unlikely, that, the, control, measures, could, completely, eradicate, the, dingo, in, central, australia, and, the, elimination, of, all, wild, dogs, is, not, considered, a, realistic, option, it, has, been, shown, that, culling, a, small, percentage, of, immature, dingoes, on, fraser, island, had, little, significant, negative, impact, on, the, overall, island, population, though, this, is, being, disputed, until, 2004, the, dingo, was, categorised, as, of, least, concern, on, the, red, list, of, threatened, species, in, 2008, it, was, recategorised, as, vulnerable, following, the, decline, in, numbers, to, around, 30, of, pure, dingoes, due, to, crossbreeding, with, domestic, dogs, in, 2018, the, iucn, regarded, the, dingo, as, a, feral, dog, and, discarded, it, from, the, red, list, dingoes, are, reasonably, abundant, in, large, parts, of, australia, but, there, is, some, argument, that, they, are, endangered, due, to, interbreeding, with, other, dogs, in, many, parts, of, their, range, dingoes, receive, varying, levels, of, protection, in, conservation, areas, such, as, national, parks, and, natural, reserves, in, new, south, wales, the, northern, territory, and, victoria, arnhem, land, and, other, aboriginal, lands, unesco, world, heritage, sites, and, the, whole, of, the, australian, capital, territory, in, some, states, dingoes, are, regarded, as, declared, pests, and, landowners, are, allowed, to, control, the, local, populations, throughout, australia, all, other, wild, dogs, are, considered, pests, fraser, island, is, a, 1, 840, square, kilometre, world, heritage, site, located, off, australia, s, eastern, coast, the, island, is, home, to, a, genetically, distinct, population, of, dingoes, that, are, free, of, dog, introgression, estimated, to, number, 120, these, dingoes, are, unique, because, they, are, closely, related, to, the, southeastern, dingoes, but, share, a, number, of, genes, with, the, new, guinea, singing, dog, and, show, some, evidence, of, admixture, with, the, northwestern, dingoes, because, of, their, conservation, value, in, february, 2013, a, report, on, fraser, island, dingo, management, strategies, was, released, with, options, including, ending, the, intimidation, of, dingoes, tagging, practice, changes, and, regular, veterinarian, checkups, as, well, as, a, permanent, dingo, sanctuary, on, the, island, according, to, dna, examinations, from, 2004, the, dingoes, of, fraser, island, are, pure, as, opposed, to, dingo, dog, hybrids, however, skull, measurements, from, the, mid, 1990s, had, a, different, result, a, 2013, study, showed, that, dingoes, living, in, the, tanami, desert, are, among, the, purest, in, australia, groups, that, have, devoted, themselves, to, the, conservation, of, the, pure, dingo, by, using, breeding, programs, include, the, australian, native, dog, conservation, society, and, the, australian, dingo, conservation, association, presently, the, efforts, of, the, dingo, conservation, groups, are, considered, to, be, ineffective, because, most, of, their, dogs, are, untested, or, are, known, to, be, hybrids, dingo, conservation, efforts, focus, primarily, on, preventing, interbreeding, between, dingoes, and, other, domestic, dogs, in, order, to, conserve, the, population, of, pure, dingoes, this, is, extremely, difficult, and, costly, conservation, efforts, are, hampered, by, the, fact, that, it, is, not, known, how, many, pure, dingoes, still, exist, in, australia, steps, to, conserve, the, pure, dingo, can, only, be, effective, when, the, identification, of, dingoes, and, other, domestic, dogs, is, absolutely, reliable, especially, in, the, case, of, living, specimens, additionally, conservation, efforts, are, in, conflict, with, control, measures, conservation, of, pure, and, survivable, dingo, populations, is, promising, in, remote, areas, where, contact, with, humans, and, other, domestic, dogs, is, rare, under, new, south, wales, state, policy, in, parks, reserves, and, other, areas, not, used, by, agriculture, these, populations, are, only, to, be, controlled, when, they, pose, a, threat, to, the, survival, of, other, native, species, the, introduction, of, dog, free, buffer, zones, around, areas, with, pure, dingoes, is, regarded, as, a, realistic, method, to, stop, interbreeding, this, is, enforced, to, the, extent, that, all, wild, dogs, can, be, killed, outside, the, conservation, areas, however, studies, from, the, year, 2007, indicate, that, even, an, intensive, control, of, core, areas, is, probably, not, able, to, stop, the, process, of, interbreeding, according, to, the, dingo, discovery, sanctuary, and, research, centre, many, studies, are, finding, a, case, for, the, re, introduction, of, the, dingo, into, previously, occupied, areas, in, order, to, return, some, balance, to, badly, degraded, areas, as, a, result, of, unregulated, and, ignorant, farming, practices, dingo, densities, have, been, measured, at, up, to, 3, per, square, kilometre, 0, 8, sq, mi, in, both, the, guy, fawkes, river, region, of, new, south, wales, and, in, south, australia, at, the, height, of, a, rabbit, plague, in, 2023, a, study, of, 402, wild, and, captive, dingoes, using, 195, 000, points, across, the, dingo, genome, indicates, that, past, studies, of, hybridisation, were, over, estimated, and, that, pure, dingoes, are, more, common, than, they, were, originally, thought, to, be, in, 2021, dna, testing, of, over, 5, 000, wild, living, canines, from, across, australia, found, that, 31, were, feral, domestic, dogs, and, 27, were, first, generation, hybrids, this, finding, challenges, the, perception, that, dingoes, are, nearly, extinct, and, have, been, replaced, by, feral, domestic, dogs, coat, colour, cannot, be, used, to, distinguish, hybrids, dingo, like, domestic, dogs, and, dingo, hybrids, can, be, generally, distinguished, by, the, more, dog, typical, kind, of, barking, that, exists, among, the, hybrids, and, differences, in, the, breeding, cycle, certain, skull, characteristics, and, genetic, analyses, can, be, used, for, differentiation, despite, all, the, characteristics, that, can, be, used, for, distinguishing, between, dingoes, and, other, domestic, dogs, there, are, two, problems, that, should, not, be, underestimated, first, there, is, no, real, clarity, regarding, at, what, point, a, dog, is, regarded, as, a, pure, dingo, and, secondly, no, distinguishing, feature, is, completely, reliable, it, is, not, known, which, characteristics, permanently, remain, under, the, conditions, of, natural, selection, there, are, two, main, opinions, regarding, this, process, of, interbreeding, the, first, and, likely, most, common, position, states, that, the, pure, dingo, should, be, preserved, via, strong, controls, of, the, wild, dog, populations, and, only, pure, or, nearly, pure, dingoes, should, be, protected, the, second, position, is, relatively, new, and, is, of, the, opinion, that, people, must, accept, that, the, dingo, has, changed, and, that, it, is, impossible, to, bring, the, pure, dingo, back, conservation, of, these, dogs, should, therefore, be, based, on, where, and, how, they, live, as, well, as, their, cultural, and, ecological, role, instead, of, concentrating, on, precise, definitions, or, concerns, about, genetic, purity, both, positions, are, controversially, discussed, due, to, this, interbreeding, there, is, a, wider, range, of, fur, colours, skull, shapes, and, body, size, in, the, modern, day, wild, dog, population, than, in, the, time, before, the, arrival, of, the, europeans, over, the, course, of, the, last, 40, years, there, has, been, an, increase, of, about, 20, in, the, average, wild, dog, body, size, it, is, currently, unknown, whether, in, the, case, of, the, disappearance, of, pure, dingoes, remaining, hybrids, would, alter, the, predation, pressure, on, other, animals, it, is, also, unclear, what, kind, of, role, these, hybrids, would, play, in, the, australian, ecosystems, however, it, is, unlikely, that, the, dynamics, of, the, various, ecosystems, will, be, excessively, disturbed, by, this, process, in, 2011, a, total, of, 3, 941, samples, were, included, in, the, first, continent, wide, dna, study, of, wild, dogs, the, study, found, that, 46, were, pure, dingoes, which, exhibited, no, dog, alleles, gene, expressions, there, was, evidence, of, hybridisation, in, every, region, sampled, in, central, australia, only, 13, were, hybrids, however, in, southeastern, australia, 99, were, hybrids, or, feral, dogs, pure, dingo, distribution, was, 88, in, the, northern, territory, intermediate, numbers, in, western, australia, south, australia, and, queensland, and, 1, in, new, south, wales, and, victoria, almost, all, wild, dogs, showed, some, dingo, ancestry, with, only, 3, of, dogs, showing, less, than, 80, dingo, ancestry, this, indicates, that, domestic, dogs, have, a, low, survival, rate, in, the, wild, or, that, most, hybridisation, is, the, result, of, roaming, dogs, that, return, to, their, owners, no, populations, of, feral, dogs, have, been, found, in, australia, in, 2016, a, three, dimensional, geometric, morphometric, analysis, of, the, skulls, of, dingoes, dogs, and, their, hybrids, found, that, dingo, dog, hybrids, exhibit, morphology, closer, to, the, dingo, than, to, the, parent, group, dog, hybridisation, did, not, push, the, unique, canis, dingo, cranial, morphology, towards, the, wolf, phenotype, therefore, hybrids, cannot, be, distinguished, from, dingoes, based, on, cranial, measures, the, study, suggests, that, the, wild, dingo, morphology, is, dominant, when, compared, with, the, recessive, dog, breed, morphology, and, concludes, that, although, hybridisation, introduces, dog, dna, into, the, dingo, population, the, native, cranial, morphology, remains, resistant, to, change
