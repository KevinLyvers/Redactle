gastroenterology, from, the, greek, gast, r, belly, nteron, intestine, and, log, a, study, of, is, the, branch, of, medicine, focused, on, the, digestive, system, and, its, disorders, the, digestive, system, consists, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, gi, tract, which, includes, the, esophagus, stomach, small, intestine, and, large, intestine, as, well, as, the, accessory, organs, of, digestion, which, include, the, pancreas, gallbladder, and, liver, the, digestive, system, functions, to, move, material, through, the, gi, tract, via, peristalsis, break, down, that, material, via, digestion, absorb, nutrients, for, use, throughout, the, body, and, remove, waste, from, the, body, via, defecation, physicians, who, specialize, in, the, medical, specialty, of, gastroenterology, are, called, gastroenterologists, or, sometimes, gi, doctors, some, of, the, most, common, conditions, managed, by, gastroenterologists, include, gastroesophageal, reflux, disease, gastrointestinal, bleeding, irritable, bowel, syndrome, inflammatory, bowel, disease, ibd, which, includes, crohn, s, disease, and, ulcerative, colitis, peptic, ulcer, disease, gallbladder, and, biliary, tract, disease, hepatitis, pancreatitis, colitis, colon, polyps, and, cancer, nutritional, problems, and, many, more, citing, from, egyptian, papyri, john, f, nunn, identified, significant, knowledge, of, gastrointestinal, diseases, among, practicing, physicians, during, the, periods, of, the, pharaohs, irynakhty, of, the, tenth, dynasty, c, 2125, b, c, was, a, court, physician, specializing, in, gastroenterology, sleeping, and, proctology, among, ancient, greeks, hippocrates, attributed, digestion, to, concoction, galen, s, concept, of, the, stomach, having, four, faculties, was, widely, accepted, up, to, modernity, in, the, seventeenth, century, 1, international, classification, of, disease, icd, 2007, who, classification, 2, mesh, subject, heading, 3, national, library, of, medicine, catalogue, nlm, classification, 2006, a, procedure, using, a, long, thin, tube, with, a, camera, that, is, passed, through, the, anus, to, visualize, the, rectum, and, the, entire, length, of, the, colon, the, procedure, is, performed, either, to, look, for, colon, polyps, and, or, colon, cancer, in, somebody, without, symptoms, referred, to, as, screening, or, to, further, evaluate, symptoms, including, rectal, bleeding, dark, tarry, stools, change, in, bowel, habits, or, stool, consistency, diarrhea, pencil, thin, stool, abdominal, pain, and, unexplained, weight, loss, before, the, procedure, the, physician, might, ask, the, patient, to, stop, taking, certain, medications, including, blood, thinners, aspirin, diabetes, medications, or, nonsteroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, a, bowel, prep, is, usually, taken, the, night, before, and, into, the, morning, of, the, procedure, which, consists, of, an, enema, or, laxatives, either, pills, or, powder, dissolved, in, liquid, that, will, cause, diarrhea, the, procedure, might, need, to, be, stopped, and, rescheduled, if, there, is, stool, remaining, in, the, colon, due, to, an, incomplete, bowel, prep, because, the, physician, can, not, adequately, visualize, the, colon, during, the, procedure, the, patient, is, sedated, and, the, scope, is, used, to, examine, the, entire, length, of, the, colon, looking, for, polyps, bleeding, or, abnormal, tissue, a, biopsy, or, polyp, removal, can, then, be, performed, and, the, tissue, sent, to, the, lab, for, evaluation, the, procedure, usually, takes, thirty, minutes, to, an, hour, followed, by, a, one, to, two, hour, observation, period, complications, include, bloating, cramping, a, reaction, to, anesthesia, bleeding, and, a, hole, through, the, wall, of, the, colon, that, may, require, repeat, colonoscopy, or, surgery, signs, of, a, serious, complication, requiring, urgent, or, emergent, medical, attention, include, severe, pain, in, the, abdomen, fever, bleeding, that, does, not, improve, dizziness, and, weakness, a, procedure, similar, to, a, colonoscopy, using, a, long, thin, tube, with, a, camera, scope, passed, through, the, anus, but, only, intended, to, visualize, the, rectum, and, the, last, part, of, the, colon, closest, to, the, rectum, all, aspects, of, the, procedure, are, the, same, as, for, a, colonoscopy, with, the, exception, that, this, procedure, only, lasts, ten, to, twenty, minutes, and, is, done, without, sedation, this, usually, allows, for, the, patient, to, return, to, normal, activities, immediately, after, the, procedure, is, finished, a, procedure, using, a, long, thin, tube, with, a, camera, that, is, passed, through, the, mouth, to, view, the, esophagus, esophago, stomach, gastro, and, the, duodenum, duodeno, it, is, also, referred, to, as, upper, endoscopy, or, just, endoscopy, the, procedure, is, performed, for, further, evaluation, of, symptoms, including, persistent, heartburn, indigestion, vomiting, blood, dark, tarry, stools, persistent, nausea, and, vomiting, pain, difficulty, swallowing, painful, swallowing, and, unexplained, weight, loss, it, is, also, performed, for, further, testing, following, a, lab, test, that, shows, low, hemoglobin, levels, without, a, known, cause, or, an, abnormal, barium, swallow, the, procedure, can, be, used, to, diagnose, many, disorders, through, direct, visualization, or, tissue, biopsy, including, esophageal, varices, esophageal, strictures, gastroesophageal, reflux, disease, barrett, s, esophagus, cancer, celiac, disease, gastritis, peptic, ulcer, disease, and, a, h, pylori, infection, intra, operative, techniques, can, then, be, used, for, treatment, of, certain, disorders, like, banding, esophageal, varices, or, dilating, esophageal, strictures, the, patient, will, likely, be, required, to, not, eat, or, drink, anything, starting, 4, hours, prior, to, the, procedure, sedation, is, usually, required, for, patient, comfort, this, procedure, usually, lasts, around, thirty, minutes, followed, by, a, one, to, two, hour, observation, period, side, effects, include, bloating, nausea, and, a, sore, throat, for, 1, to, 2, days, complications, are, rare, but, include, reaction, to, the, anesthesia, bleeding, and, a, hole, through, the, wall, of, the, esophagus, stomach, or, small, intestine, which, could, require, surgery, signs, of, a, serious, complication, requiring, urgent, or, emergent, medical, attention, include, chest, pain, problems, breathing, problems, swallowing, throat, pain, that, gets, worse, vomiting, with, blood, or, the, appearance, of, coffee, grounds, worsening, abdominal, pain, bloody, or, black, tarry, stool, and, fever, a, procedure, using, a, long, thin, tube, with, a, camera, passed, through, the, mouth, into, the, first, part, of, the, small, intestine, to, locate, diagnose, and, treat, disorders, related, to, the, bile, and, pancreatic, ducts, these, ducts, carry, fluids, that, help, with, digesting, food, from, the, liver, gallbladder, and, pancreas, and, can, become, narrowed, or, blocked, as, a, result, of, gallstones, infection, inflammation, pancreatic, pseudocysts, and, tumors, of, the, bile, ducts, or, pancreas, as, a, result, one, may, experience, back, pain, yellowing, of, the, skin, and, an, abnormal, lab, test, showing, an, elevated, bilirubin, level, which, could, necessitate, this, procedure, however, the, procedure, is, not, recommended, if, the, patient, has, acute, pancreatitis, unless, the, level, of, bilirubin, remains, high, or, is, increasing, which, could, suggest, the, blockage, is, still, present, the, patient, will, likely, be, required, to, not, eat, or, drink, anything, starting, 8, hours, prior, to, the, procedure, after, the, patient, is, sedated, the, physician, will, pass, the, scope, through, the, mouth, esophagus, stomach, and, into, the, duodenum, to, locate, the, opening, where, the, ducts, drain, into, the, small, intestine, the, physician, can, then, inject, dye, into, these, ducts, and, take, x, rays, which, show, a, real, time, view, via, fluoroscopy, allowing, the, physician, to, locate, and, relieve, the, blockage, this, is, done, through, multiple, techniques, including, cutting, the, opening, and, creating, a, bigger, hole, for, drainage, removing, gallstones, and, other, debris, dilating, narrow, parts, of, the, ducts, or, placing, a, stent, which, keeps, the, ducts, open, the, physician, can, also, take, a, biopsy, of, the, ducts, to, evaluate, for, cancer, infection, or, inflammation, side, effects, include, bloating, nausea, or, a, sore, throat, for, one, to, two, days, complications, include, pancreatitis, infection, of, the, bile, ducts, or, gallbladder, bleeding, reaction, to, the, anesthesia, and, perforation, of, any, structures, that, the, scope, or, its, instruments, pass, but, particularly, the, duodenum, bile, duct, and, pancreatic, duct, signs, of, a, serious, complication, requiring, urgent, or, emergent, medical, attention, include, bloody, or, black, tarry, stool, chest, pain, fever, worsening, abdominal, pain, worsening, throat, pain, problems, breathing, problems, swallowing, vomit, that, is, bloody, or, looks, like, coffee, grounds, most, of, the, time, complications, from, this, procedure, require, hospitalization, for, treatment, a, condition, that, is, a, result, of, stomach, contents, consistently, coming, back, up, into, the, esophagus, causing, troublesome, symptoms, or, complications, symptoms, are, considered, troublesome, based, on, how, disruptive, they, are, to, a, patient, s, daily, life, and, well, being, this, definition, was, standardized, by, the, montreal, consensus, in, 2006, symptoms, include, a, painful, feeling, in, the, middle, of, the, chest, and, feeling, stomach, contents, coming, back, up, into, the, mouth, other, symptoms, include, chest, pain, nausea, difficulty, swallowing, painful, swallowing, coughing, and, hoarseness, risk, factors, include, obesity, pregnancy, smoking, hiatal, hernia, certain, medications, and, certain, foods, diagnosis, is, usually, based, on, symptoms, and, medical, history, with, further, testing, only, after, treatment, has, been, ineffective, further, diagnosis, can, be, achieved, by, measuring, how, much, acid, enters, the, esophagus, or, looking, into, the, esophagus, with, a, scope, treatment, and, management, options, include, lifestyle, modifications, medications, and, surgery, if, there, is, no, improvement, with, other, interventions, lifestyle, modifications, include, not, lying, down, for, three, hours, after, eating, lying, down, on, the, left, side, elevating, head, while, laying, by, elevating, head, of, the, bed, or, using, extra, pillows, losing, weight, stopping, smoking, and, avoiding, coffee, mint, alcohol, chocolate, fatty, foods, acidic, foods, and, spicy, foods, medications, include, antacids, proton, pump, inhibitors, h2, receptor, blockers, surgery, is, usually, a, nissen, fundoplication, and, is, performed, by, a, surgeon, complications, of, longstanding, gerd, can, include, inflammation, of, the, esophagus, that, may, cause, bleeding, or, ulcer, formation, narrowing, of, the, esophagus, leading, to, swallowing, issues, a, change, in, the, lining, of, the, esophagus, that, can, increase, the, chances, of, developing, cancer, barrett, s, esophagus, chronic, cough, asthma, inflammation, of, the, larynx, leading, to, hoarseness, and, wearing, away, of, tooth, enamel, leading, to, dental, issues, a, condition, in, which, the, lining, of, the, esophagus, changes, to, look, more, like, the, lining, of, the, intestine, and, increases, the, risk, of, developing, esophageal, cancer, there, are, no, specific, symptoms, although, symptoms, of, gerd, may, be, present, for, years, prior, as, it, is, associated, with, a, 10, 15, risk, of, barrett, s, esophagus, risk, factors, include, chronic, gerd, for, more, than, 5, years, being, age, 50, or, older, being, non, hispanic, white, being, male, having, a, family, history, of, this, disorder, belly, fat, and, a, history, of, smoking, protective, factors, include, h, pylori, infection, frequent, use, of, aspirin, or, other, non, steroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, and, diets, high, in, fruits, and, vegetables, diagnosis, can, be, made, by, looking, into, the, esophagus, with, a, scope, and, possibly, taking, a, biopsy, of, the, lining, of, the, esophagus, treatment, includes, managing, gerd, destroying, abnormal, parts, of, the, esophagus, removing, abnormal, tissue, in, the, esophagus, and, removing, part, of, the, esophagus, as, performed, by, a, general, surgeon, further, management, could, include, periodic, surveillance, with, repeat, scopes, at, certain, intervals, determined, by, the, physician, likely, not, more, frequently, than, every, three, to, five, years, complications, from, this, disorder, can, result, in, a, type, of, cancer, called, esophageal, adenocarcinoma, gastroenterology, is, a, subspecialty, of, internal, medicine, and, therefore, requires, three, years, of, internal, medicine, residency, training, followed, by, three, additional, years, in, a, dedicated, gastroenterology, fellowship, this, training, is, certified, by, the, american, board, of, internal, medicine, abim, and, the, american, osteopathic, board, of, internal, medicine, aobim, and, must, be, completed, at, a, program, accredited, by, the, accreditation, council, for, graduate, medical, education, acgme, other, national, societies, that, oversee, training, include, the, american, college, of, gastroenterology, acg, the, american, gastroenterological, association, aga, and, the, american, society, for, gastrointestinal, endoscopy, asge, gastroenterologists, see, patients, both, in, the, clinic, and, the, hospital, setting, they, can, order, diagnostic, tests, prescribe, medications, and, perform, a, number, of, diagnostic, and, therapeutic, procedures, including, colonoscopy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, egd, endoscopic, retrograde, cholangiopancreatography, ercp, endoscopic, ultrasound, eus, and, liver, biopsy, some, gastroenterology, trainees, will, complete, a, fourth, year, although, this, is, often, their, seventh, year, of, graduate, medical, education, in, transplant, hepatology, advanced, interventional, endoscopy, inflammatory, bowel, disease, motility, or, other, topics, advanced, endoscopy, sometimes, called, interventional, or, surgical, endoscopy, is, a, sub, specialty, of, gastroenterology, that, focuses, on, advanced, endoscopic, techniques, for, the, treatment, of, pancreatic, hepatobiliary, and, gastrointestinal, disease, interventional, gastroenterologists, typically, undergo, an, additional, year, of, rigorous, training, in, advanced, endoscopic, techniques, including, endoscopic, retrograde, cholangiopancreatography, endoscopic, ultrasound, guided, diagnostic, and, interventional, procedures, and, advanced, resection, techniques, including, endoscopic, mucosal, resection, and, endoscopic, submucosal, dissection, additionally, the, performance, of, endoscopic, bariatric, procedures, is, also, performed, by, some, advanced, endoscopists, hepatology, or, hepatobiliary, medicine, encompasses, the, study, of, the, liver, pancreas, and, biliary, tree, and, is, traditionally, considered, a, sub, specialty, of, gastroenterology, while, proctology, encompasses, disorders, of, the, anus, rectum, and, colon, and, is, considered, a, sub, specialty, of, general, surgery
