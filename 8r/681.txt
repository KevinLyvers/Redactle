5, 10, see, text, see, text, the, tits, chickadees, and, titmice, constitute, the, paridae, a, large, family, of, small, passerine, birds, which, occur, mainly, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, africa, most, were, formerly, classified, in, the, genus, parus, members, of, this, family, are, commonly, referred, to, as, tits, throughout, much, of, the, english, speaking, world, but, north, american, species, are, called, either, chickadees, onomatopoeic, derived, from, their, distinctive, chick, a, dee, dee, dee, alarm, call, or, titmice, the, name, titmouse, is, recorded, from, the, 14th, century, composed, of, the, old, english, name, for, the, bird, mase, proto, germanic, maison, dutch, mees, german, meise, and, tit, denoting, something, small, the, former, spelling, titmose, was, influenced, by, mouse, in, the, 16th, century, emigrants, to, new, zealand, presumably, identified, some, of, the, superficially, similar, birds, of, the, genus, petroica, of, the, family, petroicidae, the, australian, robins, as, members, of, the, tit, family, giving, them, the, title, tomtit, although, in, fact, they, are, not, related, these, birds, are, mainly, small, stocky, woodland, species, with, short, stout, bills, some, have, crests, they, range, in, length, from, 10, to, 22, cm, 3, 9, to, 8, 7, in, they, are, adaptable, birds, with, a, mixed, diet, including, seeds, and, insects, many, species, live, around, human, habitation, and, come, readily, to, bird, feeders, for, nuts, or, seed, and, learn, to, take, other, foods, with, the, exception, of, the, three, monotypic, genera, sylviparus, melanochlora, and, pseudopodoces, the, tits, are, extremely, similar, in, appearance, and, have, been, described, as, one, of, the, most, conservative, avian, families, in, terms, of, general, morphology, the, typical, body, length, of, adult, members, of, the, family, is, between, 10, and, 16, cm, 3, 9, and, 6, 3, in, in, length, when, the, monotypic, genera, are, added, this, range, is, from, 9, to, 21, cm, 3, 5, to, 8, 3, in, in, weight, the, family, ranges, from, 5, to, 49, g, 0, 18, to, 1, 73, oz, this, contracts, to, 7, to, 29, g, 0, 25, to, 1, 02, oz, when, the, three, atypical, genera, are, removed, the, majority, of, the, variation, within, the, family, is, in, plumage, and, particularly, colour, the, bills, of, the, tits, are, generally, short, varying, between, stout, and, fine, depending, on, diet, the, more, insectivorous, species, have, finer, bills, whereas, those, that, consume, more, seeds, have, stouter, bills, it, is, said, that, tits, are, evolving, longer, beaks, to, reach, into, bird, feeders, the, most, aberrant, bill, of, the, family, is, possessed, by, hume, s, ground, tit, of, tibet, and, the, himalayas, which, is, long, and, decurved, the, tits, are, a, widespread, family, of, birds, occurring, over, most, of, europe, asia, north, america, and, africa, the, genus, poecile, occurs, from, europe, through, asia, into, north, america, as, far, south, as, southern, mexico, american, species, in, this, genus, are, known, as, chickadees, some, species, in, this, genus, have, quite, large, natural, distributions, one, the, grey, headed, chickadee, is, distributed, from, scandinavia, to, alaska, and, canada, the, majority, of, the, tits, in, the, genus, periparus, are, found, in, the, southeastern, portion, of, asia, this, includes, two, species, endemic, to, the, philippines, the, coal, tit, also, in, this, genus, is, a, much, more, widespread, species, ranging, from, the, british, isles, and, north, africa, to, japan, the, two, crested, tits, of, the, genus, lophophanes, have, a, disjunct, distribution, with, one, species, occurring, in, europe, and, the, other, in, central, asia, the, genus, baeolophus, is, endemic, to, north, america, the, genus, parus, includes, the, great, tit, that, ranges, from, western, europe, to, indonesia, cyanistes, has, a, european, and, asian, distribution, also, into, northern, africa, and, the, three, remaining, genera, pseudopodoces, sylviparus, and, melanochlora, are, all, restricted, to, asia, tits, are, active, noisy, and, social, birds, they, are, territorial, during, the, breeding, season, and, often, join, mixed, species, feeding, flocks, during, the, nonbreeding, season, the, tits, are, highly, adaptable, and, after, the, corvids, crows, and, jays, and, parrots, amongst, the, most, intelligent, of, all, birds, fission, fusion, society, has, been, documented, in, a, number, of, avian, taxa, including, this, one, in, brief, that, means, flocks, can, split, into, smaller, groups, or, individuals, and, subsequently, reunite, the, tits, make, a, variety, of, calls, and, songs, they, are, amongst, the, most, vocal, of, all, birds, calling, continuously, in, most, situations, so, much, so, that, they, are, only, ever, silent, for, specific, reasons, such, as, avoiding, predators, or, when, intruding, on, a, rival, s, territory, quiet, contact, calls, are, made, while, feeding, to, facilitate, cohesion, with, others, in, their, social, group, other, calls, are, used, for, signalling, alarm, a, well, known, example, being, the, chic, a, dee, dee, of, north, american, species, in, the, genus, poecile, the, call, which, gives, them, their, local, common, name, the, chickadee, the, call, also, serves, as, a, rallying, call, to, summon, others, to, mob, and, harass, the, predator, the, number, of, dee, syllables, at, the, end, of, the, call, increases, with, the, level, of, danger, the, predator, poses, the, tits, are, generalist, insectivores, that, consume, a, wide, range, of, small, insects, and, other, invertebrates, particularly, small, defoliating, caterpillars, they, also, consume, seeds, and, nuts, particularly, in, the, winter, one, characteristic, method, of, foraging, in, the, family, is, hanging, where, they, inspect, a, branch, or, twig, and, leaves, from, all, angles, while, hanging, upside, down, to, feed, in, areas, where, numerous, species, of, tit, coexist, different, species, forage, in, different, parts, of, the, tree, their, niche, determined, in, no, small, way, by, their, morphology, larger, species, forage, on, the, ground, medium, sized, species, foraging, on, larger, branches, and, the, smallest, species, on, the, ends, of, branches, having, obtained, larger, prey, items, or, seeds, tits, engage, in, hold, hammering, where, they, hold, the, item, between, their, feet, and, hammer, it, with, their, bill, until, it, opens, in, this, fashion, they, can, even, open, hazelnuts, in, around, 20, minutes, a, number, of, genera, engage, in, food, caching, hoarding, supplies, of, food, during, the, winter, tits, are, cavity, nesting, birds, typically, using, trees, although, pseudopodoces, builds, a, nest, on, the, ground, most, tree, nesting, tits, excavate, their, nests, and, clutch, sizes, are, generally, large, for, altricial, birds, ranging, from, usually, two, eggs, in, the, rufous, vented, tit, of, the, himalayas, to, as, many, as, 10, to, 14, in, the, blue, tit, of, europe, in, favourable, conditions, this, species, had, laid, as, many, as, 19, eggs, which, is, the, largest, clutch, of, any, altricial, bird, most, tits, are, multibrooded, a, necessary, strategy, to, cope, with, either, the, harsh, winters, in, which, they, reside, in, the, holarctic, or, the, extremely, erratic, conditions, of, tropical, africa, where, typically, a, single, pair, cannot, find, enough, food, to, rear, even, one, nestling, and, in, drought, years, breeding, is, likely, to, be, futile, many, african, tit, species, along, with, pseudopodoces, are, cooperative, breeders, and, even, pair, breeding, parids, are, often, highly, social, and, maintain, stable, flocks, throughout, the, nonbreeding, season, tits, also, have, a, variety, of, methods, for, attracting, mates, primarily, through, their, intricate, bouncing, mating, dance, only, the, blue, tit, is, typically, polygynous, all, other, species, are, generally, monogamous, courtship, feeding, is, typical, of, pair, breeding, tits, to, deal, with, the, cost, of, rearing, their, large, broods, recently, the, large, parus, group, has, been, gradually, split, into, several, genera, as, indicated, below, initially, by, north, american, ornithological, authorities, and, later, elsewhere, whereas, in, the, mid, 1990s, only, pseudopodoces, baeolophus, melanochlora, and, sylviparus, were, considered, well, supported, by, the, available, data, as, distinct, from, parus, today, this, arrangement, is, considered, paraphyletic, as, indicated, by, mtdna, cytochrome, b, sequence, analysis, and, parus, is, best, restricted, to, the, parus, major, parus, fasciiventer, clade, and, even, the, latter, species, closest, relatives, might, be, considered, a, distinct, genus, in, the, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, the, family, paridae, is, much, enlarged, to, include, related, groups, such, as, the, penduline, tits, and, long, tailed, tits, but, while, the, former, are, quite, close, to, the, tits, and, could, conceivably, be, included, in, that, family, together, with, the, stenostirid, warblers, the, long, tailed, tits, are, not, indeed, the, yellow, browed, tit, and, the, sultan, tit, are, possibly, more, distant, to, the, tits, than, the, penduline, tits, are, if, the, two, current, families, are, lumped, into, the, paridae, the, tits, would, be, a, subfamily, parinae, alternatively, all, tits, save, the, two, monotypic, genera, discussed, in, the, preceding, section, and, possibly, cyanistes, but, including, hume, s, ground, tit, could, be, lumped, in, parus, in, any, case, four, major, clades, of, typical, tits, can, be, recognized, the, dark, capped, chickadees, and, their, relatives, poecile, including, sittiparus, the, long, crested, baeolophus, and, lophophanes, species, the, usually, tufted, white, cheeked, periparus, including, pardaliparus, with, more, subdued, coloration, and, finally, parus, sensu, stricto, including, melaniparus, and, machlolophus, still, the, interrelationship, of, these, as, well, as, the, relationships, of, many, species, within, the, clades, are, not, well, resolved, at, all, analysis, of, morphology, and, biogeography, probably, gives, a, more, robust, picture, than, the, available, molecular, data, tits, have, settled, north, america, twice, probably, at, some, time, during, the, early, mid, pliocene, the, first, were, the, ancestors, of, baeolophus, with, chickadees, arriving, somewhat, later, remizidae, cephalopyrus, flammiceps, sylviparus, modestus, melanochlora, sultanea, pardaliparus, periparus, baeolophus, lophophanes, sittiparus, poecile, cyanistes, pseudopodoces, parus, monticolus, parus, major, machlolophus, melaniparus, family, paridae
