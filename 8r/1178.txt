see, phyla, bacteria, b, k, t, r, i, sg, bacterium, are, ubiquitous, mostly, free, living, organisms, often, consisting, of, one, biological, cell, they, constitute, a, large, domain, of, prokaryotic, microorganisms, typically, a, few, micrometres, in, length, bacteria, were, among, the, first, life, forms, to, appear, on, earth, and, are, present, in, most, of, its, habitats, bacteria, inhabit, soil, water, acidic, hot, springs, radioactive, waste, and, the, deep, biosphere, of, earth, s, crust, bacteria, play, a, vital, role, in, many, stages, of, the, nutrient, cycle, by, recycling, nutrients, and, the, fixation, of, nitrogen, from, the, atmosphere, the, nutrient, cycle, includes, the, decomposition, of, dead, bodies, bacteria, are, responsible, for, the, putrefaction, stage, in, this, process, in, the, biological, communities, surrounding, hydrothermal, vents, and, cold, seeps, extremophile, bacteria, provide, the, nutrients, needed, to, sustain, life, by, converting, dissolved, compounds, such, as, hydrogen, sulphide, and, methane, to, energy, bacteria, also, live, in, mutualistic, commensal, and, parasitic, relationships, with, plants, and, animals, most, bacteria, have, not, been, characterised, and, there, are, many, species, that, cannot, be, grown, in, the, laboratory, the, study, of, bacteria, is, known, as, bacteriology, a, branch, of, microbiology, like, all, animals, humans, carry, vast, numbers, approximately, 10, 13, to, 10, 14, of, bacteria, most, are, in, the, gut, though, there, are, many, on, the, skin, most, of, the, bacteria, in, and, on, the, body, are, harmless, or, rendered, so, by, the, protective, effects, of, the, immune, system, and, many, are, beneficial, particularly, the, ones, in, the, gut, however, several, species, of, bacteria, are, pathogenic, and, cause, infectious, diseases, including, cholera, syphilis, anthrax, leprosy, tuberculosis, tetanus, and, bubonic, plague, the, most, common, fatal, bacterial, diseases, are, respiratory, infections, antibiotics, are, used, to, treat, bacterial, infections, and, are, also, used, in, farming, making, antibiotic, resistance, a, growing, problem, bacteria, are, important, in, sewage, treatment, and, the, breakdown, of, oil, spills, the, production, of, cheese, and, yogurt, through, fermentation, the, recovery, of, gold, palladium, copper, and, other, metals, in, the, mining, sector, biomining, bioleaching, as, well, as, in, biotechnology, and, the, manufacture, of, antibiotics, and, other, chemicals, once, regarded, as, plants, constituting, the, class, schizomycetes, fission, fungi, bacteria, are, now, classified, as, prokaryotes, unlike, cells, of, animals, and, other, eukaryotes, bacterial, cells, do, not, contain, a, nucleus, and, rarely, harbour, membrane, bound, organelles, although, the, term, bacteria, traditionally, included, all, prokaryotes, the, scientific, classification, changed, after, the, discovery, in, the, 1990s, that, prokaryotes, consist, of, two, very, different, groups, of, organisms, that, evolved, from, an, ancient, common, ancestor, these, evolutionary, domains, are, called, bacteria, and, archaea, the, word, bacteria, is, the, plural, of, the, neo, latin, bacterium, which, is, the, latinisation, of, the, ancient, greek, bakt, rion, the, diminutive, of, bakt, r, a, meaning, staff, cane, because, the, first, ones, to, be, discovered, were, rod, shaped, the, ancestors, of, bacteria, were, unicellular, microorganisms, that, were, the, first, forms, of, life, to, appear, on, earth, about, 4, billion, years, ago, for, about, 3, billion, years, most, organisms, were, microscopic, and, bacteria, and, archaea, were, the, dominant, forms, of, life, although, bacterial, fossils, exist, such, as, stromatolites, their, lack, of, distinctive, morphology, prevents, them, from, being, used, to, examine, the, history, of, bacterial, evolution, or, to, date, the, time, of, origin, of, a, particular, bacterial, species, however, gene, sequences, can, be, used, to, reconstruct, the, bacterial, phylogeny, and, these, studies, indicate, that, bacteria, diverged, first, from, the, archaeal, eukaryotic, lineage, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, mrca, of, bacteria, and, archaea, was, probably, a, hyperthermophile, that, lived, about, 2, 5, billion, 3, 2, billion, years, ago, the, earliest, life, on, land, may, have, been, bacteria, some, 3, 22, billion, years, ago, bacteria, were, also, involved, in, the, second, great, evolutionary, divergence, that, of, the, archaea, and, eukaryotes, here, eukaryotes, resulted, from, the, entering, of, ancient, bacteria, into, endosymbiotic, associations, with, the, ancestors, of, eukaryotic, cells, which, were, themselves, possibly, related, to, the, archaea, this, involved, the, engulfment, by, proto, eukaryotic, cells, of, alphaproteobacterial, symbionts, to, form, either, mitochondria, or, hydrogenosomes, which, are, still, found, in, all, known, eukarya, sometimes, in, highly, reduced, form, e, g, in, ancient, amitochondrial, protozoa, later, some, eukaryotes, that, already, contained, mitochondria, also, engulfed, cyanobacteria, like, organisms, leading, to, the, formation, of, chloroplasts, in, algae, and, plants, this, is, known, as, primary, endosymbiosis, bacteria, are, ubiquitous, living, in, every, possible, habitat, on, the, planet, including, soil, underwater, deep, in, earth, s, crust, and, even, such, extreme, environments, as, acidic, hot, springs, and, radioactive, waste, there, are, thought, to, be, approximately, 2, 10, 30, bacteria, on, earth, forming, a, biomass, that, is, only, exceeded, by, plants, they, are, abundant, in, lakes, and, oceans, in, arctic, ice, and, geothermal, springs, where, they, provide, the, nutrients, needed, to, sustain, life, by, converting, dissolved, compounds, such, as, hydrogen, sulphide, and, methane, to, energy, they, live, on, and, in, plants, and, animals, most, do, not, cause, diseases, are, beneficial, to, their, environments, and, are, essential, for, life, the, soil, is, a, rich, source, of, bacteria, and, a, few, grams, contain, around, a, thousand, million, of, them, they, are, all, essential, to, soil, ecology, breaking, down, toxic, waste, and, recycling, nutrients, they, are, even, found, in, the, atmosphere, and, one, cubic, metre, of, air, holds, around, one, hundred, million, bacterial, cells, the, oceans, and, seas, harbour, around, 3, x, 10, 26, bacteria, which, provide, up, to, 50, of, the, oxygen, humans, breathe, only, around, 2, of, bacterial, species, have, been, fully, studied, size, bacteria, display, a, wide, diversity, of, shapes, and, sizes, bacterial, cells, are, about, one, tenth, the, size, of, eukaryotic, cells, and, are, typically, 0, 5, 5, 0, micrometres, in, length, however, a, few, species, are, visible, to, the, unaided, eye, for, example, thiomargarita, namibiensis, is, up, to, half, a, millimetre, long, epulopiscium, fishelsoni, reaches, 0, 7, mm, and, thiomargarita, magnifica, can, reach, even, 2, cm, in, length, which, is, 50, times, larger, than, other, known, bacteria, among, the, smallest, bacteria, are, members, of, the, genus, mycoplasma, which, measure, only, 0, 3, micrometres, as, small, as, the, largest, viruses, some, bacteria, may, be, even, smaller, but, these, ultramicrobacteria, are, not, well, studied, shape, most, bacterial, species, are, either, spherical, called, cocci, singular, coccus, from, greek, k, kkos, grain, seed, or, rod, shaped, called, bacilli, sing, bacillus, from, latin, baculus, stick, some, bacteria, called, vibrio, are, shaped, like, slightly, curved, rods, or, comma, shaped, others, can, be, spiral, shaped, called, spirilla, or, tightly, coiled, called, spirochaetes, a, small, number, of, other, unusual, shapes, have, been, described, such, as, star, shaped, bacteria, this, wide, variety, of, shapes, is, determined, by, the, bacterial, cell, wall, and, cytoskeleton, and, is, important, because, it, can, influence, the, ability, of, bacteria, to, acquire, nutrients, attach, to, surfaces, swim, through, liquids, and, escape, predators, multicellularity, most, bacterial, species, exist, as, single, cells, others, associate, in, characteristic, patterns, neisseria, forms, diploids, pairs, streptococci, form, chains, and, staphylococci, group, together, in, bunch, of, grapes, clusters, bacteria, can, also, group, to, form, larger, multicellular, structures, such, as, the, elongated, filaments, of, actinomycetota, species, the, aggregates, of, myxobacteria, species, and, the, complex, hyphae, of, streptomyces, species, these, multicellular, structures, are, often, only, seen, in, certain, conditions, for, example, when, starved, of, amino, acids, myxobacteria, detect, surrounding, cells, in, a, process, known, as, quorum, sensing, migrate, towards, each, other, and, aggregate, to, form, fruiting, bodies, up, to, 500, micrometres, long, and, containing, approximately, 100, 000, bacterial, cells, in, these, fruiting, bodies, the, bacteria, perform, separate, tasks, for, example, about, one, in, ten, cells, migrate, to, the, top, of, a, fruiting, body, and, differentiate, into, a, specialised, dormant, state, called, a, myxospore, which, is, more, resistant, to, drying, and, other, adverse, environmental, conditions, biofilms, bacteria, often, attach, to, surfaces, and, form, dense, aggregations, called, biofilms, and, larger, formations, known, as, microbial, mats, these, biofilms, and, mats, can, range, from, a, few, micrometres, in, thickness, to, up, to, half, a, metre, in, depth, and, may, contain, multiple, species, of, bacteria, protists, and, archaea, bacteria, living, in, biofilms, display, a, complex, arrangement, of, cells, and, extracellular, components, forming, secondary, structures, such, as, microcolonies, through, which, there, are, networks, of, channels, to, enable, better, diffusion, of, nutrients, in, natural, environments, such, as, soil, or, the, surfaces, of, plants, the, majority, of, bacteria, are, bound, to, surfaces, in, biofilms, biofilms, are, also, important, in, medicine, as, these, structures, are, often, present, during, chronic, bacterial, infections, or, in, infections, of, implanted, medical, devices, and, bacteria, protected, within, biofilms, are, much, harder, to, kill, than, individual, isolated, bacteria, the, bacterial, cell, is, surrounded, by, a, cell, membrane, which, is, made, primarily, of, phospholipids, this, membrane, encloses, the, contents, of, the, cell, and, acts, as, a, barrier, to, hold, nutrients, proteins, and, other, essential, components, of, the, cytoplasm, within, the, cell, unlike, eukaryotic, cells, bacteria, usually, lack, large, membrane, bound, structures, in, their, cytoplasm, such, as, a, nucleus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and, the, other, organelles, present, in, eukaryotic, cells, however, some, bacteria, have, protein, bound, organelles, in, the, cytoplasm, which, compartmentalise, aspects, of, bacterial, metabolism, such, as, the, carboxysome, additionally, bacteria, have, a, multi, component, cytoskeleton, to, control, the, localisation, of, proteins, and, nucleic, acids, within, the, cell, and, to, manage, the, process, of, cell, division, many, important, biochemical, reactions, such, as, energy, generation, occur, due, to, concentration, gradients, across, membranes, creating, a, potential, difference, analogous, to, a, battery, the, general, lack, of, internal, membranes, in, bacteria, means, these, reactions, such, as, electron, transport, occur, across, the, cell, membrane, between, the, cytoplasm, and, the, outside, of, the, cell, or, periplasm, however, in, many, photosynthetic, bacteria, the, plasma, membrane, is, highly, folded, and, fills, most, of, the, cell, with, layers, of, light, gathering, membrane, these, light, gathering, complexes, may, even, form, lipid, enclosed, structures, called, chlorosomes, in, green, sulfur, bacteria, bacteria, do, not, have, a, membrane, bound, nucleus, and, their, genetic, material, is, typically, a, single, circular, bacterial, chromosome, of, dna, located, in, the, cytoplasm, in, an, irregularly, shaped, body, called, the, nucleoid, the, nucleoid, contains, the, chromosome, with, its, associated, proteins, and, rna, like, all, other, organisms, bacteria, contain, ribosomes, for, the, production, of, proteins, but, the, structure, of, the, bacterial, ribosome, is, different, from, that, of, eukaryotes, and, archaea, some, bacteria, produce, intracellular, nutrient, storage, granules, such, as, glycogen, polyphosphate, sulfur, or, polyhydroxyalkanoates, bacteria, such, as, the, photosynthetic, cyanobacteria, produce, internal, gas, vacuoles, which, they, use, to, regulate, their, buoyancy, allowing, them, to, move, up, or, down, into, water, layers, with, different, light, intensities, and, nutrient, levels, around, the, outside, of, the, cell, membrane, is, the, cell, wall, bacterial, cell, walls, are, made, of, peptidoglycan, also, called, murein, which, is, made, from, polysaccharide, chains, cross, linked, by, peptides, containing, d, amino, acids, bacterial, cell, walls, are, different, from, the, cell, walls, of, plants, and, fungi, which, are, made, of, cellulose, and, chitin, respectively, the, cell, wall, of, bacteria, is, also, distinct, from, that, of, achaea, which, do, not, contain, peptidoglycan, the, cell, wall, is, essential, to, the, survival, of, many, bacteria, and, the, antibiotic, penicillin, produced, by, a, fungus, called, penicillium, is, able, to, kill, bacteria, by, inhibiting, a, step, in, the, synthesis, of, peptidoglycan, there, are, broadly, speaking, two, different, types, of, cell, wall, in, bacteria, that, classify, bacteria, into, gram, positive, bacteria, and, gram, negative, bacteria, the, names, originate, from, the, reaction, of, cells, to, the, gram, stain, a, long, standing, test, for, the, classification, of, bacterial, species, gram, positive, bacteria, possess, a, thick, cell, wall, containing, many, layers, of, peptidoglycan, and, teichoic, acids, in, contrast, gram, negative, bacteria, have, a, relatively, thin, cell, wall, consisting, of, a, few, layers, of, peptidoglycan, surrounded, by, a, second, lipid, membrane, containing, lipopolysaccharides, and, lipoproteins, most, bacteria, have, the, gram, negative, cell, wall, and, only, members, of, the, bacillota, group, and, actinomycetota, previously, known, as, the, low, g, c, and, high, g, c, gram, positive, bacteria, respectively, have, the, alternative, gram, positive, arrangement, these, differences, in, structure, can, produce, differences, in, antibiotic, susceptibility, for, instance, vancomycin, can, kill, only, gram, positive, bacteria, and, is, ineffective, against, gram, negative, pathogens, such, as, haemophilus, influenzae, or, pseudomonas, aeruginosa, some, bacteria, have, cell, wall, structures, that, are, neither, classically, gram, positive, or, gram, negative, this, includes, clinically, important, bacteria, such, as, mycobacteria, which, have, a, thick, peptidoglycan, cell, wall, like, a, gram, positive, bacterium, but, also, a, second, outer, layer, of, lipids, in, many, bacteria, an, s, layer, of, rigidly, arrayed, protein, molecules, covers, the, outside, of, the, cell, this, layer, provides, chemical, and, physical, protection, for, the, cell, surface, and, can, act, as, a, macromolecular, diffusion, barrier, s, layers, have, diverse, functions, and, are, known, to, act, as, virulence, factors, in, campylobacter, species, and, contain, surface, enzymes, in, bacillus, stearothermophilus, flagella, are, rigid, protein, structures, about, 20, nanometres, in, diameter, and, up, to, 20, micrometres, in, length, that, are, used, for, motility, flagella, are, driven, by, the, energy, released, by, the, transfer, of, ions, down, an, electrochemical, gradient, across, the, cell, membrane, fimbriae, sometimes, called, attachment, pili, are, fine, filaments, of, protein, usually, 2, 10, nanometres, in, diameter, and, up, to, several, micrometres, in, length, they, are, distributed, over, the, surface, of, the, cell, and, resemble, fine, hairs, when, seen, under, the, electron, microscope, fimbriae, are, believed, to, be, involved, in, attachment, to, solid, surfaces, or, to, other, cells, and, are, essential, for, the, virulence, of, some, bacterial, pathogens, pili, sing, pilus, are, cellular, appendages, slightly, larger, than, fimbriae, that, can, transfer, genetic, material, between, bacterial, cells, in, a, process, called, conjugation, where, they, are, called, conjugation, pili, or, sex, pili, see, bacterial, genetics, below, they, can, also, generate, movement, where, they, are, called, type, iv, pili, glycocalyx, is, produced, by, many, bacteria, to, surround, their, cells, and, varies, in, structural, complexity, ranging, from, a, disorganised, slime, layer, of, extracellular, polymeric, substances, to, a, highly, structured, capsule, these, structures, can, protect, cells, from, engulfment, by, eukaryotic, cells, such, as, macrophages, part, of, the, human, immune, system, they, can, also, act, as, antigens, and, be, involved, in, cell, recognition, as, well, as, aiding, attachment, to, surfaces, and, the, formation, of, biofilms, the, assembly, of, these, extracellular, structures, is, dependent, on, bacterial, secretion, systems, these, transfer, proteins, from, the, cytoplasm, into, the, periplasm, or, into, the, environment, around, the, cell, many, types, of, secretion, systems, are, known, and, these, structures, are, often, essential, for, the, virulence, of, pathogens, so, are, intensively, studied, some, genera, of, gram, positive, bacteria, such, as, bacillus, clostridium, sporohalobacter, anaerobacter, and, heliobacterium, can, form, highly, resistant, dormant, structures, called, endospores, endospores, develop, within, the, cytoplasm, of, the, cell, generally, a, single, endospore, develops, in, each, cell, each, endospore, contains, a, core, of, dna, and, ribosomes, surrounded, by, a, cortex, layer, and, protected, by, a, multilayer, rigid, coat, composed, of, peptidoglycan, and, a, variety, of, proteins, endospores, show, no, detectable, metabolism, and, can, survive, extreme, physical, and, chemical, stresses, such, as, high, levels, of, uv, light, gamma, radiation, detergents, disinfectants, heat, freezing, pressure, and, desiccation, in, this, dormant, state, these, organisms, may, remain, viable, for, millions, of, years, endospores, even, allow, bacteria, to, survive, exposure, to, the, vacuum, and, radiation, of, outer, space, leading, to, the, possibility, that, bacteria, could, be, distributed, throughout, the, universe, by, space, dust, meteoroids, asteroids, comets, planetoids, or, directed, panspermia, endospore, forming, bacteria, can, cause, disease, for, example, anthrax, can, be, contracted, by, the, inhalation, of, bacillus, anthracis, endospores, and, contamination, of, deep, puncture, wounds, with, clostridium, tetani, endospores, causes, tetanus, which, like, botulism, is, caused, by, a, toxin, released, by, the, bacteria, that, grow, from, the, spores, clostridioides, difficile, infection, a, common, problem, in, healthcare, settings, is, caused, by, spore, forming, bacteria, bacteria, exhibit, an, extremely, wide, variety, of, metabolic, types, the, distribution, of, metabolic, traits, within, a, group, of, bacteria, has, traditionally, been, used, to, define, their, taxonomy, but, these, traits, often, do, not, correspond, with, modern, genetic, classifications, bacterial, metabolism, is, classified, into, nutritional, groups, on, the, basis, of, three, major, criteria, the, source, of, energy, the, electron, donors, used, and, the, source, of, carbon, used, for, growth, phototrophic, bacteria, derive, energy, from, light, using, photosynthesis, while, chemotrophic, bacteria, breaking, down, chemical, compounds, through, oxidation, driving, metabolism, by, transferring, electrons, from, a, given, electron, donor, to, a, terminal, electron, acceptor, in, a, redox, reaction, chemotrophs, are, further, divided, by, the, types, of, compounds, they, use, to, transfer, electrons, bacteria, that, derive, electrons, from, inorganic, compounds, such, as, hydrogen, carbon, monoxide, or, ammonia, are, called, lithotrophs, while, those, that, use, organic, compounds, are, called, organotrophs, still, more, specifically, aerobic, organisms, use, oxygen, as, the, terminal, electron, acceptor, while, anaerobic, organisms, use, other, compounds, such, as, nitrate, sulfate, or, carbon, dioxide, many, bacteria, called, heterotrophs, derive, their, carbon, from, other, organic, carbon, others, such, as, cyanobacteria, and, some, purple, bacteria, are, autotrophic, meaning, they, obtain, cellular, carbon, by, fixing, carbon, dioxide, in, unusual, circumstances, the, gas, methane, can, be, used, by, methanotrophic, bacteria, as, both, a, source, of, electrons, and, a, substrate, for, carbon, anabolism, in, many, ways, bacterial, metabolism, provides, traits, that, are, useful, for, ecological, stability, and, for, human, society, for, example, diazotrophs, have, the, ability, to, fix, nitrogen, gas, using, the, enzyme, nitrogenase, this, trait, which, can, be, found, in, bacteria, of, most, metabolic, types, listed, above, leads, to, the, ecologically, important, processes, of, denitrification, sulfate, reduction, and, acetogenesis, respectively, bacterial, metabolic, processes, are, important, drivers, in, biological, responses, to, pollution, for, example, sulfate, reducing, bacteria, are, largely, responsible, for, the, production, of, the, highly, toxic, forms, of, mercury, methyl, and, dimethylmercury, in, the, environment, nonrespiratory, anaerobes, use, fermentation, to, generate, energy, and, reducing, power, secreting, metabolic, by, products, such, as, ethanol, in, brewing, as, waste, facultative, anaerobes, can, switch, between, fermentation, and, different, terminal, electron, acceptors, depending, on, the, environmental, conditions, in, which, they, find, themselves, unlike, in, multicellular, organisms, increases, in, cell, size, cell, growth, and, reproduction, by, cell, division, are, tightly, linked, in, unicellular, organisms, bacteria, grow, to, a, fixed, size, and, then, reproduce, through, binary, fission, a, form, of, asexual, reproduction, under, optimal, conditions, bacteria, can, grow, and, divide, extremely, rapidly, and, some, bacterial, populations, can, double, as, quickly, as, every, 17, minutes, in, cell, division, two, identical, clone, daughter, cells, are, produced, some, bacteria, while, still, reproducing, asexually, form, more, complex, reproductive, structures, that, help, disperse, the, newly, formed, daughter, cells, examples, include, fruiting, body, formation, by, myxobacteria, and, aerial, hyphae, formation, by, streptomyces, species, or, budding, budding, involves, a, cell, forming, a, protrusion, that, breaks, away, and, produces, a, daughter, cell, in, the, laboratory, bacteria, are, usually, grown, using, solid, or, liquid, media, solid, growth, media, such, as, agar, plates, are, used, to, isolate, pure, cultures, of, a, bacterial, strain, however, liquid, growth, media, are, used, when, the, measurement, of, growth, or, large, volumes, of, cells, are, required, growth, in, stirred, liquid, media, occurs, as, an, even, cell, suspension, making, the, cultures, easy, to, divide, and, transfer, although, isolating, single, bacteria, from, liquid, media, is, difficult, the, use, of, selective, media, media, with, specific, nutrients, added, or, deficient, or, with, antibiotics, added, can, help, identify, specific, organisms, most, laboratory, techniques, for, growing, bacteria, use, high, levels, of, nutrients, to, produce, large, amounts, of, cells, cheaply, and, quickly, however, in, natural, environments, nutrients, are, limited, meaning, that, bacteria, cannot, continue, to, reproduce, indefinitely, this, nutrient, limitation, has, led, the, evolution, of, different, growth, strategies, see, r, k, selection, theory, some, organisms, can, grow, extremely, rapidly, when, nutrients, become, available, such, as, the, formation, of, algal, and, cyanobacterial, blooms, that, often, occur, in, lakes, during, the, summer, other, organisms, have, adaptations, to, harsh, environments, such, as, the, production, of, multiple, antibiotics, by, streptomyces, that, inhibit, the, growth, of, competing, microorganisms, in, nature, many, organisms, live, in, communities, e, g, biofilms, that, may, allow, for, increased, supply, of, nutrients, and, protection, from, environmental, stresses, these, relationships, can, be, essential, for, growth, of, a, particular, organism, or, group, of, organisms, syntrophy, bacterial, growth, follows, four, phases, when, a, population, of, bacteria, first, enter, a, high, nutrient, environment, that, allows, growth, the, cells, need, to, adapt, to, their, new, environment, the, first, phase, of, growth, is, the, lag, phase, a, period, of, slow, growth, when, the, cells, are, adapting, to, the, high, nutrient, environment, and, preparing, for, fast, growth, the, lag, phase, has, high, biosynthesis, rates, as, proteins, necessary, for, rapid, growth, are, produced, the, second, phase, of, growth, is, the, logarithmic, phase, also, known, as, the, exponential, phase, the, log, phase, is, marked, by, rapid, exponential, growth, the, rate, at, which, cells, grow, during, this, phase, is, known, as, the, growth, rate, k, and, the, time, it, takes, the, cells, to, double, is, known, as, the, generation, time, g, during, log, phase, nutrients, are, metabolised, at, maximum, speed, until, one, of, the, nutrients, is, depleted, and, starts, limiting, growth, the, third, phase, of, growth, is, the, stationary, phase, and, is, caused, by, depleted, nutrients, the, cells, reduce, their, metabolic, activity, and, consume, non, essential, cellular, proteins, the, stationary, phase, is, a, transition, from, rapid, growth, to, a, stress, response, state, and, there, is, increased, expression, of, genes, involved, in, dna, repair, antioxidant, metabolism, and, nutrient, transport, the, final, phase, is, the, death, phase, where, the, bacteria, run, out, of, nutrients, and, die, most, bacteria, have, a, single, circular, chromosome, that, can, range, in, size, from, only, 160, 000, base, pairs, in, the, endosymbiotic, bacteria, carsonella, ruddii, to, 12, 200, 000, base, pairs, 12, 2, mbp, in, the, soil, dwelling, bacteria, sorangium, cellulosum, there, are, many, exceptions, to, this, for, example, some, streptomyces, and, borrelia, species, contain, a, single, linear, chromosome, while, some, vibrio, species, contain, more, than, one, chromosome, some, bacteria, contain, plasmids, small, extra, chromosomal, molecules, of, dna, that, may, contain, genes, for, various, useful, functions, such, as, antibiotic, resistance, metabolic, capabilities, or, various, virulence, factors, bacteria, genomes, usually, encode, a, few, hundred, to, a, few, thousand, genes, the, genes, in, bacterial, genomes, are, usually, a, single, continuous, stretch, of, dna, although, several, different, types, of, introns, do, exist, in, bacteria, these, are, much, rarer, than, in, eukaryotes, bacteria, as, asexual, organisms, inherit, an, identical, copy, of, the, parent, s, genome, and, are, clonal, however, all, bacteria, can, evolve, by, selection, on, changes, to, their, genetic, material, dna, caused, by, genetic, recombination, or, mutations, mutations, arise, from, errors, made, during, the, replication, of, dna, or, from, exposure, to, mutagens, mutation, rates, vary, widely, among, different, species, of, bacteria, and, even, among, different, clones, of, a, single, species, of, bacteria, genetic, changes, in, bacterial, genomes, emerge, from, either, random, mutation, during, replication, or, stress, directed, mutation, where, genes, involved, in, a, particular, growth, limiting, process, have, an, increased, mutation, rate, some, bacteria, transfer, genetic, material, between, cells, this, can, occur, in, three, main, ways, first, bacteria, can, take, up, exogenous, dna, from, their, environment, in, a, process, called, transformation, many, bacteria, can, naturally, take, up, dna, from, the, environment, while, others, must, be, chemically, altered, in, order, to, induce, them, to, take, up, dna, the, development, of, competence, in, nature, is, usually, associated, with, stressful, environmental, conditions, and, seems, to, be, an, adaptation, for, facilitating, repair, of, dna, damage, in, recipient, cells, second, bacteriophages, can, integrate, into, the, bacterial, chromosome, introducing, foreign, dna, in, a, process, known, as, transduction, many, types, of, bacteriophage, exist, some, infect, and, lyse, their, host, bacteria, while, others, insert, into, the, bacterial, chromosome, bacteria, resist, phage, infection, through, restriction, modification, systems, that, degrade, foreign, dna, and, a, system, that, uses, crispr, sequences, to, retain, fragments, of, the, genomes, of, phage, that, the, bacteria, have, come, into, contact, with, in, the, past, which, allows, them, to, block, virus, replication, through, a, form, of, rna, interference, third, bacteria, can, transfer, genetic, material, through, direct, cell, contact, via, conjugation, in, ordinary, circumstances, transduction, conjugation, and, transformation, involve, transfer, of, dna, between, individual, bacteria, of, the, same, species, but, occasionally, transfer, may, occur, between, individuals, of, different, bacterial, species, and, this, may, have, significant, consequences, such, as, the, transfer, of, antibiotic, resistance, in, such, cases, gene, acquisition, from, other, bacteria, or, the, environment, is, called, horizontal, gene, transfer, and, may, be, common, under, natural, conditions, many, bacteria, are, motile, able, to, move, themselves, and, do, so, using, a, variety, of, mechanisms, the, best, studied, of, these, are, flagella, long, filaments, that, are, turned, by, a, motor, at, the, base, to, generate, propeller, like, movement, the, bacterial, flagellum, is, made, of, about, 20, proteins, with, approximately, another, 30, proteins, required, for, its, regulation, and, assembly, the, flagellum, is, a, rotating, structure, driven, by, a, reversible, motor, at, the, base, that, uses, the, electrochemical, gradient, across, the, membrane, for, power, bacteria, can, use, flagella, in, different, ways, to, generate, different, kinds, of, movement, many, bacteria, such, as, e, coli, have, two, distinct, modes, of, movement, forward, movement, swimming, and, tumbling, the, tumbling, allows, them, to, reorient, and, makes, their, movement, a, three, dimensional, random, walk, bacterial, species, differ, in, the, number, and, arrangement, of, flagella, on, their, surface, some, have, a, single, flagellum, monotrichous, a, flagellum, at, each, end, amphitrichous, clusters, of, flagella, at, the, poles, of, the, cell, lophotrichous, while, others, have, flagella, distributed, over, the, entire, surface, of, the, cell, peritrichous, the, flagella, of, a, group, of, bacteria, the, spirochaetes, are, found, between, two, membranes, in, the, periplasmic, space, they, have, a, distinctive, helical, body, that, twists, about, as, it, moves, two, other, types, of, bacterial, motion, are, called, twitching, motility, that, relies, on, a, structure, called, the, type, iv, pilus, and, gliding, motility, that, uses, other, mechanisms, in, twitching, motility, the, rod, like, pilus, extends, out, from, the, cell, binds, some, substrate, and, then, retracts, pulling, the, cell, forward, motile, bacteria, are, attracted, or, repelled, by, certain, stimuli, in, behaviours, called, taxes, these, include, chemotaxis, phototaxis, energy, taxis, and, magnetotaxis, in, one, peculiar, group, the, myxobacteria, individual, bacteria, move, together, to, form, waves, of, cells, that, then, differentiate, to, form, fruiting, bodies, containing, spores, the, myxobacteria, move, only, when, on, solid, surfaces, unlike, e, coli, which, is, motile, in, liquid, or, solid, media, several, listeria, and, shigella, species, move, inside, host, cells, by, usurping, the, cytoskeleton, which, is, normally, used, to, move, organelles, inside, the, cell, by, promoting, actin, polymerisation, at, one, pole, of, their, cells, they, can, form, a, kind, of, tail, that, pushes, them, through, the, host, cell, s, cytoplasm, a, few, bacteria, have, chemical, systems, that, generate, light, this, bioluminescence, often, occurs, in, bacteria, that, live, in, association, with, fish, and, the, light, probably, serves, to, attract, fish, or, other, large, animals, bacteria, often, function, as, multicellular, aggregates, known, as, biofilms, exchanging, a, variety, of, molecular, signals, for, intercell, communication, and, engaging, in, coordinated, multicellular, behaviour, the, communal, benefits, of, multicellular, cooperation, include, a, cellular, division, of, labour, accessing, resources, that, cannot, effectively, be, used, by, single, cells, collectively, defending, against, antagonists, and, optimising, population, survival, by, differentiating, into, distinct, cell, types, for, example, bacteria, in, biofilms, can, have, more, than, five, hundred, times, increased, resistance, to, antibacterial, agents, than, individual, planktonic, bacteria, of, the, same, species, one, type, of, intercellular, communication, by, a, molecular, signal, is, called, quorum, sensing, which, serves, the, purpose, of, determining, whether, the, local, population, density, is, sufficient, to, support, investment, in, processes, that, are, only, successful, if, large, numbers, of, similar, organisms, behave, similarly, such, as, excreting, digestive, enzymes, or, emitting, light, quorum, sensing, enables, bacteria, to, coordinate, gene, expression, and, to, produce, release, and, detect, autoinducers, or, pheromones, that, accumulate, with, the, growth, in, cell, population, classification, seeks, to, describe, the, diversity, of, bacterial, species, by, naming, and, grouping, organisms, based, on, similarities, bacteria, can, be, classified, on, the, basis, of, cell, structure, cellular, metabolism, or, on, differences, in, cell, components, such, as, dna, fatty, acids, pigments, antigens, and, quinones, while, these, schemes, allowed, the, identification, and, classification, of, bacterial, strains, it, was, unclear, whether, these, differences, represented, variation, between, distinct, species, or, between, strains, of, the, same, species, this, uncertainty, was, due, to, the, lack, of, distinctive, structures, in, most, bacteria, as, well, as, lateral, gene, transfer, between, unrelated, species, due, to, lateral, gene, transfer, some, closely, related, bacteria, can, have, very, different, morphologies, and, metabolisms, to, overcome, this, uncertainty, modern, bacterial, classification, emphasises, molecular, systematics, using, genetic, techniques, such, as, guanine, cytosine, ratio, determination, genome, genome, hybridisation, as, well, as, sequencing, genes, that, have, not, undergone, extensive, lateral, gene, transfer, such, as, the, rrna, gene, classification, of, bacteria, is, determined, by, publication, in, the, international, journal, of, systematic, bacteriology, and, bergey, s, manual, of, systematic, bacteriology, the, international, committee, on, systematic, bacteriology, icsb, maintains, international, rules, for, the, naming, of, bacteria, and, taxonomic, categories, and, for, the, ranking, of, them, in, the, international, code, of, nomenclature, of, bacteria, historically, bacteria, were, considered, a, part, of, the, plantae, the, plant, kingdom, and, were, called, schizomycetes, fission, fungi, for, this, reason, collective, bacteria, and, other, microorganisms, in, a, host, are, often, called, flora, the, term, bacteria, was, traditionally, applied, to, all, microscopic, single, cell, prokaryotes, however, molecular, systematics, showed, prokaryotic, life, to, consist, of, two, separate, domains, originally, called, eubacteria, and, archaebacteria, but, now, called, bacteria, and, archaea, that, evolved, independently, from, an, ancient, common, ancestor, the, archaea, and, eukaryotes, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, either, is, to, the, bacteria, these, two, domains, along, with, eukarya, are, the, basis, of, the, three, domain, system, which, is, currently, the, most, widely, used, classification, system, in, microbiology, however, due, to, the, relatively, recent, introduction, of, molecular, systematics, and, a, rapid, increase, in, the, number, of, genome, sequences, that, are, available, bacterial, classification, remains, a, changing, and, expanding, field, for, example, cavalier, smith, argued, that, the, archaea, and, eukaryotes, evolved, from, gram, positive, bacteria, the, identification, of, bacteria, in, the, laboratory, is, particularly, relevant, in, medicine, where, the, correct, treatment, is, determined, by, the, bacterial, species, causing, an, infection, consequently, the, need, to, identify, human, pathogens, was, a, major, impetus, for, the, development, of, techniques, to, identify, bacteria, the, gram, stain, developed, in, 1884, by, hans, christian, gram, characterises, bacteria, based, on, the, structural, characteristics, of, their, cell, walls, the, thick, layers, of, peptidoglycan, in, the, gram, positive, cell, wall, stain, purple, while, the, thin, gram, negative, cell, wall, appears, pink, by, combining, morphology, and, gram, staining, most, bacteria, can, be, classified, as, belonging, to, one, of, four, groups, gram, positive, cocci, gram, positive, bacilli, gram, negative, cocci, and, gram, negative, bacilli, some, organisms, are, best, identified, by, stains, other, than, the, gram, stain, particularly, mycobacteria, or, nocardia, which, show, acid, fastness, on, ziehl, neelsen, or, similar, stains, other, organisms, may, need, to, be, identified, by, their, growth, in, special, media, or, by, other, techniques, such, as, serology, culture, techniques, are, designed, to, promote, the, growth, and, identify, particular, bacteria, while, restricting, the, growth, of, the, other, bacteria, in, the, sample, often, these, techniques, are, designed, for, specific, specimens, for, example, a, sputum, sample, will, be, treated, to, identify, organisms, that, cause, pneumonia, while, stool, specimens, are, cultured, on, selective, media, to, identify, organisms, that, cause, diarrhea, while, preventing, growth, of, non, pathogenic, bacteria, specimens, that, are, normally, sterile, such, as, blood, urine, or, spinal, fluid, are, cultured, under, conditions, designed, to, grow, all, possible, organisms, once, a, pathogenic, organism, has, been, isolated, it, can, be, further, characterised, by, its, morphology, growth, patterns, such, as, aerobic, or, anaerobic, growth, patterns, of, hemolysis, and, staining, as, with, bacterial, classification, identification, of, bacteria, is, increasingly, using, molecular, methods, and, mass, spectroscopy, most, bacteria, have, not, been, characterised, and, there, are, many, species, that, cannot, be, grown, in, the, laboratory, diagnostics, using, dna, based, tools, such, as, polymerase, chain, reaction, are, increasingly, popular, due, to, their, specificity, and, speed, compared, to, culture, based, methods, these, methods, also, allow, the, detection, and, identification, of, viable, but, nonculturable, cells, that, are, metabolically, active, but, non, dividing, however, even, using, these, improved, methods, the, total, number, of, bacterial, species, is, not, known, and, cannot, even, be, estimated, with, any, certainty, following, present, classification, there, are, a, little, less, than, 9, 300, known, species, of, prokaryotes, which, includes, bacteria, and, archaea, but, attempts, to, estimate, the, true, number, of, bacterial, diversity, have, ranged, from, 10, 7, to, 10, 9, total, species, and, even, these, diverse, estimates, may, be, off, by, many, orders, of, magnitude, the, following, phyla, have, been, validly, published, according, to, the, bacteriological, code, despite, their, apparent, simplicity, bacteria, can, form, complex, associations, with, other, organisms, these, symbiotic, associations, can, be, divided, into, parasitism, mutualism, and, commensalism, the, word, commensalism, is, derived, from, the, word, commensal, meaning, eating, at, the, same, table, and, all, plants, and, animals, are, colonised, by, commensal, bacteria, in, humans, and, other, animals, millions, of, them, live, on, the, skin, the, airways, the, gut, and, other, orifices, referred, to, as, normal, flora, or, commensals, these, bacteria, usually, cause, no, harm, but, may, occasionally, invade, other, sites, of, the, body, and, cause, infection, escherichia, coli, is, a, commensal, in, the, human, gut, but, can, cause, urinary, tract, infections, similarly, streptococci, which, are, part, of, the, normal, flora, of, the, human, mouth, can, cause, heart, disease, some, species, of, bacteria, kill, and, then, consume, other, microorganisms, these, species, are, called, predatory, bacteria, these, include, organisms, such, as, myxococcus, xanthus, which, forms, swarms, of, cells, that, kill, and, digest, any, bacteria, they, encounter, other, bacterial, predators, either, attach, to, their, prey, in, order, to, digest, them, and, absorb, nutrients, or, invade, another, cell, and, multiply, inside, the, cytosol, these, predatory, bacteria, are, thought, to, have, evolved, from, saprophages, that, consumed, dead, microorganisms, through, adaptations, that, allowed, them, to, entrap, and, kill, other, organisms, certain, bacteria, form, close, spatial, associations, that, are, essential, for, their, survival, one, such, mutualistic, association, called, interspecies, hydrogen, transfer, occurs, between, clusters, of, anaerobic, bacteria, that, consume, organic, acids, such, as, butyric, acid, or, propionic, acid, and, produce, hydrogen, and, methanogenic, archaea, that, consume, hydrogen, the, bacteria, in, this, association, are, unable, to, consume, the, organic, acids, as, this, reaction, produces, hydrogen, that, accumulates, in, their, surroundings, only, the, intimate, association, with, the, hydrogen, consuming, archaea, keeps, the, hydrogen, concentration, low, enough, to, allow, the, bacteria, to, grow, in, soil, microorganisms, that, reside, in, the, rhizosphere, a, zone, that, includes, the, root, surface, and, the, soil, that, adheres, to, the, root, after, gentle, shaking, carry, out, nitrogen, fixation, converting, nitrogen, gas, to, nitrogenous, compounds, this, serves, to, provide, an, easily, absorbable, form, of, nitrogen, for, many, plants, which, cannot, fix, nitrogen, themselves, many, other, bacteria, are, found, as, symbionts, in, humans, and, other, organisms, for, example, the, presence, of, over, 1, 000, bacterial, species, in, the, normal, human, gut, flora, of, the, intestines, can, contribute, to, gut, immunity, synthesise, vitamins, such, as, folic, acid, vitamin, k, and, biotin, convert, sugars, to, lactic, acid, see, lactobacillus, as, well, as, fermenting, complex, undigestible, carbohydrates, the, presence, of, this, gut, flora, also, inhibits, the, growth, of, potentially, pathogenic, bacteria, usually, through, competitive, exclusion, and, these, beneficial, bacteria, are, consequently, sold, as, probiotic, dietary, supplements, nearly, all, animal, life, is, dependent, on, bacteria, for, survival, as, only, bacteria, and, some, archaea, possess, the, genes, and, enzymes, necessary, to, synthesise, vitamin, b, 12, also, known, as, cobalamin, and, provide, it, through, the, food, chain, vitamin, b, 12, is, a, water, soluble, vitamin, that, is, involved, in, the, metabolism, of, every, cell, of, the, human, body, it, is, a, cofactor, in, dna, synthesis, and, in, both, fatty, acid, and, amino, acid, metabolism, it, is, particularly, important, in, the, normal, functioning, of, the, nervous, system, via, its, role, in, the, synthesis, of, myelin, the, body, is, continually, exposed, to, many, species, of, bacteria, including, beneficial, commensals, which, grow, on, the, skin, and, mucous, membranes, and, saprophytes, which, grow, mainly, in, the, soil, and, in, decaying, matter, the, blood, and, tissue, fluids, contain, nutrients, sufficient, to, sustain, the, growth, of, many, bacteria, the, body, has, defence, mechanisms, that, enable, it, to, resist, microbial, invasion, of, its, tissues, and, give, it, a, natural, immunity, or, innate, resistance, against, many, microorganisms, unlike, some, viruses, bacteria, evolve, relatively, slowly, so, many, bacterial, diseases, also, occur, in, other, animals, if, bacteria, form, a, parasitic, association, with, other, organisms, they, are, classed, as, pathogens, pathogenic, bacteria, are, a, major, cause, of, human, death, and, disease, and, cause, infections, such, as, tetanus, caused, by, clostridium, tetani, typhoid, fever, diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne, illness, leprosy, caused, by, mycobacterium, leprae, and, tuberculosis, caused, by, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, a, pathogenic, cause, for, a, known, medical, disease, may, only, be, discovered, many, years, later, as, was, the, case, with, helicobacter, pylori, and, peptic, ulcer, disease, bacterial, diseases, are, also, important, in, agriculture, and, bacteria, cause, leaf, spot, fire, blight, and, wilts, in, plants, as, well, as, johne, s, disease, mastitis, salmonella, and, anthrax, in, farm, animals, each, species, of, pathogen, has, a, characteristic, spectrum, of, interactions, with, its, human, hosts, some, organisms, such, as, staphylococcus, or, streptococcus, can, cause, skin, infections, pneumonia, meningitis, and, sepsis, a, systemic, inflammatory, response, producing, shock, massive, vasodilation, and, death, yet, these, organisms, are, also, part, of, the, normal, human, flora, and, usually, exist, on, the, skin, or, in, the, nose, without, causing, any, disease, at, all, other, organisms, invariably, cause, disease, in, humans, such, as, rickettsia, which, are, obligate, intracellular, parasites, able, to, grow, and, reproduce, only, within, the, cells, of, other, organisms, one, species, of, rickettsia, causes, typhus, while, another, causes, rocky, mountain, spotted, fever, chlamydia, another, phylum, of, obligate, intracellular, parasites, contains, species, that, can, cause, pneumonia, or, urinary, tract, infection, and, may, be, involved, in, coronary, heart, disease, some, species, such, as, pseudomonas, aeruginosa, burkholderia, cenocepacia, and, mycobacterium, avium, are, opportunistic, pathogens, and, cause, disease, mainly, in, people, who, are, immunosuppressed, or, have, cystic, fibrosis, some, bacteria, produce, toxins, which, cause, diseases, these, are, endotoxins, which, come, from, broken, bacterial, cells, and, exotoxins, which, are, produced, by, bacteria, and, released, into, the, environment, the, bacterium, clostridium, botulinum, for, example, produces, a, powerful, exotoxin, that, cause, respiratory, paralysis, and, salmonellae, produce, an, endotoxin, that, causes, gastroenteritis, some, exotoxins, can, be, converted, to, toxoids, which, are, used, as, vaccines, to, prevent, the, disease, bacterial, infections, may, be, treated, with, antibiotics, which, are, classified, as, bacteriocidal, if, they, kill, bacteria, or, bacteriostatic, if, they, just, prevent, bacterial, growth, there, are, many, types, of, antibiotics, and, each, class, inhibits, a, process, that, is, different, in, the, pathogen, from, that, found, in, the, host, an, example, of, how, antibiotics, produce, selective, toxicity, are, chloramphenicol, and, puromycin, which, inhibit, the, bacterial, ribosome, but, not, the, structurally, different, eukaryotic, ribosome, antibiotics, are, used, both, in, treating, human, disease, and, in, intensive, farming, to, promote, animal, growth, where, they, may, be, contributing, to, the, rapid, development, of, antibiotic, resistance, in, bacterial, populations, infections, can, be, prevented, by, antiseptic, measures, such, as, sterilising, the, skin, prior, to, piercing, it, with, the, needle, of, a, syringe, and, by, proper, care, of, indwelling, catheters, surgical, and, dental, instruments, are, also, sterilised, to, prevent, contamination, by, bacteria, disinfectants, such, as, bleach, are, used, to, kill, bacteria, or, other, pathogens, on, surfaces, to, prevent, contamination, and, further, reduce, the, risk, of, infection, bacteria, often, lactic, acid, bacteria, such, as, lactobacillus, species, and, lactococcus, species, in, combination, with, yeasts, and, moulds, have, been, used, for, thousands, of, years, in, the, preparation, of, fermented, foods, such, as, cheese, pickles, soy, sauce, sauerkraut, vinegar, wine, and, yogurt, the, ability, of, bacteria, to, degrade, a, variety, of, organic, compounds, is, remarkable, and, has, been, used, in, waste, processing, and, bioremediation, bacteria, capable, of, digesting, the, hydrocarbons, in, petroleum, are, often, used, to, clean, up, oil, spills, fertiliser, was, added, to, some, of, the, beaches, in, prince, william, sound, in, an, attempt, to, promote, the, growth, of, these, naturally, occurring, bacteria, after, the, 1989, exxon, valdez, oil, spill, these, efforts, were, effective, on, beaches, that, were, not, too, thickly, covered, in, oil, bacteria, are, also, used, for, the, bioremediation, of, industrial, toxic, wastes, in, the, chemical, industry, bacteria, are, most, important, in, the, production, of, enantiomerically, pure, chemicals, for, use, as, pharmaceuticals, or, agrichemicals, bacteria, can, also, be, used, in, place, of, pesticides, in, biological, pest, control, this, commonly, involves, bacillus, thuringiensis, also, called, bt, a, gram, positive, soil, dwelling, bacterium, subspecies, of, this, bacteria, are, used, as, lepidopteran, specific, insecticides, under, trade, names, such, as, dipel, and, thuricide, because, of, their, specificity, these, pesticides, are, regarded, as, environmentally, friendly, with, little, or, no, effect, on, humans, wildlife, pollinators, and, most, other, beneficial, insects, because, of, their, ability, to, quickly, grow, and, the, relative, ease, with, which, they, can, be, manipulated, bacteria, are, the, workhorses, for, the, fields, of, molecular, biology, genetics, and, biochemistry, by, making, mutations, in, bacterial, dna, and, examining, the, resulting, phenotypes, scientists, can, determine, the, function, of, genes, enzymes, and, metabolic, pathways, in, bacteria, then, apply, this, knowledge, to, more, complex, organisms, this, aim, of, understanding, the, biochemistry, of, a, cell, reaches, its, most, complex, expression, in, the, synthesis, of, huge, amounts, of, enzyme, kinetic, and, gene, expression, data, into, mathematical, models, of, entire, organisms, this, is, achievable, in, some, well, studied, bacteria, with, models, of, escherichia, coli, metabolism, now, being, produced, and, tested, this, understanding, of, bacterial, metabolism, and, genetics, allows, the, use, of, biotechnology, to, bioengineer, bacteria, for, the, production, of, therapeutic, proteins, such, as, insulin, growth, factors, or, antibodies, because, of, their, importance, for, research, in, general, samples, of, bacterial, strains, are, isolated, and, preserved, in, biological, resource, centers, this, ensures, the, availability, of, the, strain, to, scientists, worldwide, bacteria, were, first, observed, by, the, dutch, microscopist, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, in, 1676, using, a, single, lens, microscope, of, his, own, design, he, then, published, his, observations, in, a, series, of, letters, to, the, royal, society, of, london, bacteria, were, leeuwenhoek, s, most, remarkable, microscopic, discovery, their, size, was, just, at, the, limit, of, what, his, simple, lenses, could, resolve, and, in, one, of, the, most, striking, hiatuses, in, the, history, of, science, no, one, else, would, see, them, again, for, over, a, century, his, observations, also, included, protozoans, which, he, called, animalcules, and, his, findings, were, looked, at, again, in, the, light, of, the, more, recent, findings, of, cell, theory, christian, gottfried, ehrenberg, introduced, the, word, bacterium, in, 1828, in, fact, his, bacterium, was, a, genus, that, contained, non, spore, forming, rod, shaped, bacteria, as, opposed, to, bacillus, a, genus, of, spore, forming, rod, shaped, bacteria, defined, by, ehrenberg, in, 1835, louis, pasteur, demonstrated, in, 1859, that, the, growth, of, microorganisms, causes, the, fermentation, process, and, that, this, growth, is, not, due, to, spontaneous, generation, yeasts, and, molds, commonly, associated, with, fermentation, are, not, bacteria, but, rather, fungi, along, with, his, contemporary, robert, koch, pasteur, was, an, early, advocate, of, the, germ, theory, of, disease, before, them, ignaz, semmelweis, and, joseph, lister, had, realised, the, importance, of, sanitised, hands, in, medical, work, semmelweis, who, in, the, 1840s, formulated, his, rules, for, handwashing, in, the, hospital, prior, to, the, advent, of, germ, theory, attributed, disease, to, decomposing, animal, organic, matter, his, ideas, were, rejected, and, his, book, on, the, topic, condemned, by, the, medical, community, after, lister, however, doctors, started, sanitising, their, hands, in, the, 1870s, robert, koch, a, pioneer, in, medical, microbiology, worked, on, cholera, anthrax, and, tuberculosis, in, his, research, into, tuberculosis, koch, finally, proved, the, germ, theory, for, which, he, received, a, nobel, prize, in, 1905, in, koch, s, postulates, he, set, out, criteria, to, test, if, an, organism, is, the, cause, of, a, disease, and, these, postulates, are, still, used, today, ferdinand, cohn, is, said, to, be, a, founder, of, bacteriology, studying, bacteria, from, 1870, cohn, was, the, first, to, classify, bacteria, based, on, their, morphology, though, it, was, known, in, the, nineteenth, century, that, bacteria, are, the, cause, of, many, diseases, no, effective, antibacterial, treatments, were, available, in, 1910, paul, ehrlich, developed, the, first, antibiotic, by, changing, dyes, that, selectively, stained, treponema, pallidum, the, spirochaete, that, causes, syphilis, into, compounds, that, selectively, killed, the, pathogen, ehrlich, who, had,
