the, subphylum, chelicerata, from, neo, latin, from, french, ch, lic, re, from, ancient, greek, kh, l, claw, chela, and, k, ras, horn, constitutes, one, of, the, major, subdivisions, of, the, phylum, arthropoda, chelicerates, include, the, sea, spiders, horseshoe, crabs, and, arachnids, including, harvestmen, scorpions, spiders, solifuges, ticks, and, mites, among, many, others, as, well, as, a, number, of, extinct, lineages, such, as, the, eurypterids, sea, scorpions, and, chasmataspidids, chelicerata, split, from, mandibulata, by, the, mid, cambrian, as, evidenced, by, stem, group, chelicerates, like, habeliida, and, mollisonia, present, by, this, time, the, surviving, marine, species, include, the, four, species, of, xiphosurans, horseshoe, crabs, and, possibly, the, 1, 300, species, of, pycnogonids, sea, spiders, if, the, latter, are, indeed, chelicerates, on, the, other, hand, there, are, over, 77, 000, well, identified, species, of, air, breathing, chelicerates, and, there, may, be, about, 500, 000, unidentified, species, like, all, arthropods, chelicerates, have, segmented, bodies, with, jointed, limbs, all, covered, in, a, cuticle, made, of, chitin, and, proteins, the, chelicerate, body, plan, consists, of, two, tagmata, the, prosoma, and, the, opisthosoma, except, that, mites, have, lost, a, visible, division, between, these, sections, the, chelicerae, which, give, the, group, its, name, are, the, only, appendages, that, appear, before, the, mouth, in, most, sub, groups, they, are, modest, pincers, used, to, feed, however, spiders, chelicerae, form, fangs, that, most, species, use, to, inject, venom, into, prey, the, group, has, the, open, circulatory, system, typical, of, arthropods, in, which, a, tube, like, heart, pumps, blood, through, the, hemocoel, which, is, the, major, body, cavity, marine, chelicerates, have, gills, while, the, air, breathing, forms, generally, have, both, book, lungs, and, tracheae, in, general, the, ganglia, of, living, chelicerates, central, nervous, systems, fuse, into, large, masses, in, the, cephalothorax, but, there, are, wide, variations, and, this, fusion, is, very, limited, in, the, mesothelae, which, are, regarded, as, the, oldest, and, most, basal, group, of, spiders, most, chelicerates, rely, on, modified, bristles, for, touch, and, for, information, about, vibrations, air, currents, and, chemical, changes, in, their, environment, the, most, active, hunting, spiders, also, have, very, acute, eyesight, chelicerates, were, originally, predators, but, the, group, has, diversified, to, use, all, the, major, feeding, strategies, predation, parasitism, herbivory, scavenging, and, eating, decaying, organic, matter, although, harvestmen, can, digest, solid, food, the, guts, of, most, modern, chelicerates, are, too, narrow, for, this, and, they, generally, liquidize, their, food, by, grinding, it, with, their, chelicerae, and, pedipalps, and, flooding, it, with, digestive, enzymes, to, conserve, water, air, breathing, chelicerates, excrete, waste, as, solids, that, are, removed, from, their, blood, by, malpighian, tubules, structures, that, also, evolved, independently, in, insects, while, the, marine, horseshoe, crabs, rely, on, external, fertilization, air, breathing, chelicerates, use, internal, but, usually, indirect, fertilization, many, species, use, elaborate, courtship, rituals, to, attract, mates, most, lay, eggs, that, hatch, as, what, look, like, miniature, adults, but, all, scorpions, and, a, few, species, of, mites, keep, the, eggs, inside, their, bodies, until, the, young, emerge, in, most, chelicerate, species, the, young, have, to, fend, for, themselves, but, in, scorpions, and, some, species, of, spider, the, females, protect, and, feed, their, young, the, evolutionary, origins, of, chelicerates, from, the, early, arthropods, have, been, debated, for, decades, although, there, is, considerable, agreement, about, the, relationships, between, most, chelicerate, sub, groups, the, inclusion, of, the, pycnogonida, in, this, taxon, has, been, questioned, and, the, exact, position, of, scorpions, is, still, controversial, though, they, were, long, considered, the, most, basal, of, the, arachnids, venom, has, evolved, three, times, in, the, chelicerates, spiders, scorpions, and, pseudoscorpions, or, four, times, if, the, hematophagous, secretions, produced, by, ticks, are, included, in, addition, there, have, been, undocumented, descriptions, of, venom, glands, in, solifugae, chemical, defense, has, been, found, in, whip, scorpions, shorttailed, whipscorpions, harvestmen, beetle, mites, and, sea, spiders, although, the, venom, of, a, few, spider, and, scorpion, species, can, be, very, dangerous, to, humans, medical, researchers, are, investigating, the, use, of, these, venoms, for, the, treatment, of, disorders, ranging, from, cancer, to, erectile, dysfunction, the, medical, industry, also, uses, the, blood, of, horseshoe, crabs, as, a, test, for, the, presence, of, contaminant, bacteria, mites, can, cause, allergies, in, humans, transmit, several, diseases, to, humans, and, their, livestock, and, are, serious, agricultural, pests, the, chelicerata, are, arthropods, as, they, have, segmented, bodies, with, jointed, limbs, all, covered, in, a, cuticle, made, of, chitin, and, proteins, heads, that, are, composed, of, several, segments, that, fuse, during, the, development, of, the, embryo, a, much, reduced, coelom, a, hemocoel, through, which, the, blood, circulates, driven, by, a, tube, like, heart, chelicerates, bodies, consist, of, two, tagmata, sets, of, segments, that, serve, similar, functions, the, foremost, one, called, the, prosoma, or, cephalothorax, and, the, rear, tagma, is, called, the, opisthosoma, or, abdomen, however, in, the, acari, mites, and, ticks, there, is, no, visible, division, between, these, sections, the, prosoma, is, formed, in, the, embryo, by, fusion, of, the, ocular, somite, referred, as, acron, in, previous, literatures, which, carries, the, eyes, and, labrum, with, six, post, ocular, segments, somite, 1, to, 6, which, all, have, paired, appendages, it, was, previously, thought, that, chelicerates, had, lost, the, antennae, bearing, somite, 1, but, later, investigations, reveal, that, it, is, retained, and, corresponds, to, a, pair, of, chelicerae, or, chelifores, small, appendages, that, often, form, pincers, somite, 2, has, a, pair, of, pedipalps, that, in, most, sub, groups, perform, sensory, functions, while, the, remaining, four, cephalothorax, segments, somite, 4, to, 6, have, pairs, of, legs, in, basal, forms, the, ocular, somite, has, a, pair, of, compound, eyes, on, the, sides, and, four, pigment, cup, ocelli, little, eyes, in, the, middle, the, mouth, is, between, somite, 1, and, 2, chelicerae, and, pedipalps, the, opisthosoma, consists, of, thirteen, or, fewer, segments, may, or, may, not, end, with, a, telson, in, some, taxa, such, as, scorpion, and, eurypterid, the, opisthosoma, divided, into, two, groups, mesosoma, and, metasoma, the, abdominal, appendages, of, modern, chelicerates, are, missing, or, heavily, modified, for, example, in, spiders, the, remaining, appendages, form, spinnerets, that, extrude, silk, while, those, of, horseshoe, crabs, xiphosura, form, gills, like, all, arthropods, chelicerates, bodies, and, appendages, are, covered, with, a, tough, cuticle, made, mainly, of, chitin, and, chemically, hardened, proteins, since, this, cannot, stretch, the, animals, must, molt, to, grow, in, other, words, they, grow, new, but, still, soft, cuticles, then, cast, off, the, old, one, and, wait, for, the, new, one, to, harden, until, the, new, cuticle, hardens, the, animals, are, defenseless, and, almost, immobilized, chelicerae, and, pedipalps, are, the, two, pairs, of, appendages, closest, to, the, mouth, they, vary, widely, in, form, and, function, and, the, consistent, difference, between, them, is, their, position, in, the, embryo, and, corresponding, neurons, chelicerae, are, deutocerebral, and, arise, from, somite, 1, ahead, of, the, mouth, while, pedipalps, are, tritocerebral, and, arise, from, somite, 2, behind, the, mouth, the, chelicerae, claw, horns, that, give, the, sub, phylum, its, name, normally, consist, of, three, sections, and, the, claw, is, formed, by, the, third, section, and, a, rigid, extension, of, the, second, however, spiders, have, only, two, sections, and, the, second, forms, a, fang, that, folds, away, behind, the, first, when, not, in, use, the, relative, sizes, of, chelicerae, vary, widely, those, of, some, fossil, eurypterids, and, modern, harvestmen, form, large, claws, that, extended, ahead, of, the, body, while, scorpions, are, tiny, pincers, that, are, used, in, feeding, and, project, only, slightly, in, front, of, the, head, in, basal, chelicerates, the, pedipalps, are, unspecialized, and, subequal, to, the, posterior, pairs, of, walking, legs, however, in, sea, spider, and, arachnids, the, pedipalps, are, more, or, less, specialized, for, sensory, or, prey, catching, function, for, example, scorpions, have, pincers, and, male, spiders, have, bulbous, tips, that, act, as, syringes, to, inject, sperm, into, the, females, reproductive, openings, when, mating, as, in, all, arthropods, the, chelicerate, body, has, a, very, small, coelom, restricted, to, small, areas, round, the, reproductive, and, excretory, systems, the, main, body, cavity, is, a, hemocoel, that, runs, most, of, the, length, of, the, body, and, through, which, blood, flows, driven, by, a, tubular, heart, that, collects, blood, from, the, rear, and, pumps, it, forward, although, arteries, direct, the, blood, to, specific, parts, of, the, body, they, have, open, ends, rather, than, joining, directly, to, veins, and, chelicerates, therefore, have, open, circulatory, systems, as, is, typical, for, arthropods, these, depend, on, individual, sub, groups, environments, modern, terrestrial, chelicerates, generally, have, both, book, lungs, which, deliver, oxygen, and, remove, waste, gases, via, the, blood, and, tracheae, which, do, the, same, without, using, the, blood, as, a, transport, system, the, living, horseshoe, crabs, are, aquatic, and, have, book, gills, that, lie, in, a, horizontal, plane, for, a, long, time, it, was, assumed, that, the, extinct, eurypterids, had, gills, but, the, fossil, evidence, was, ambiguous, however, a, fossil, of, the, 45, millimetres, 1, 8, in, long, eurypterid, onychopterella, from, the, late, ordovician, period, has, what, appear, to, be, four, pairs, of, vertically, oriented, book, gills, whose, internal, structure, is, very, similar, to, that, of, scorpions, book, lungs, the, guts, of, most, modern, chelicerates, are, too, narrow, to, take, solid, food, all, scorpions, and, almost, all, spiders, are, predators, that, pre, process, food, in, preoral, cavities, formed, by, the, chelicerae, and, the, bases, of, the, pedipalps, however, one, predominantly, herbivore, spider, species, is, known, and, many, supplement, their, diets, with, nectar, and, pollen, many, of, the, acari, ticks, and, mites, are, blood, sucking, parasites, but, there, are, many, predatory, herbivore, and, scavenger, sub, groups, all, the, acari, have, a, retractable, feeding, assembly, that, consists, of, the, chelicerae, pedipalps, and, parts, of, the, exoskeleton, and, which, forms, a, preoral, cavity, for, pre, processing, food, harvestmen, are, among, the, minority, of, living, chelicerates, that, can, take, solid, food, and, the, group, includes, predators, herbivores, and, scavengers, horseshoe, crabs, are, also, capable, of, processing, solid, food, and, use, a, distinctive, feeding, system, claws, at, the, tips, of, their, legs, grab, small, invertebrates, and, pass, them, to, a, food, groove, that, runs, from, between, the, rearmost, legs, to, the, mouth, which, is, on, the, underside, of, the, head, and, faces, slightly, backwards, the, bases, of, the, legs, form, toothed, gnathobases, that, both, grind, the, food, and, push, it, towards, the, mouth, this, is, how, the, earliest, arthropods, are, thought, to, have, fed, horseshoe, crabs, convert, nitrogenous, wastes, to, ammonia, and, dump, it, via, their, gills, and, excrete, other, wastes, as, feces, via, the, anus, they, also, have, nephridia, little, kidneys, which, extract, other, wastes, for, excretion, as, urine, ammonia, is, so, toxic, that, it, must, be, diluted, rapidly, with, large, quantities, of, water, most, terrestrial, chelicerates, cannot, afford, to, use, so, much, water, and, therefore, convert, nitrogenous, wastes, to, other, chemicals, which, they, excrete, as, dry, matter, extraction, is, by, various, combinations, of, nephridia, and, malpighian, tubules, the, tubules, filter, wastes, out, of, the, blood, and, dump, them, into, the, hindgut, as, solids, a, system, that, has, evolved, independently, in, insects, and, several, groups, of, arachnids, chelicerate, nervous, systems, are, based, on, the, standard, arthropod, model, of, a, pair, of, nerve, cords, each, with, a, ganglion, per, segment, and, a, brain, formed, by, fusion, of, the, ganglia, just, behind, the, mouth, with, those, ahead, of, it, if, one, assume, that, chelicerates, lose, the, first, segment, which, bears, antennae, in, other, arthropods, chelicerate, brains, include, only, one, pair, of, pre, oral, ganglia, instead, of, two, however, there, is, evidence, that, the, first, segment, is, indeed, available, and, bears, the, cheliceres, there, is, a, notable, but, variable, trend, towards, fusion, of, other, ganglia, into, the, brain, the, brains, of, horseshoe, crabs, include, all, the, ganglia, of, the, prosoma, plus, those, of, the, first, two, opisthosomal, segments, while, the, other, opisthosomal, segments, retain, separate, pairs, of, ganglia, in, most, living, arachnids, except, scorpions, if, they, are, true, arachnids, all, the, ganglia, including, those, that, would, normally, be, in, the, opisthosoma, are, fused, into, a, single, mass, in, the, prosoma, and, there, are, no, ganglia, in, the, opisthosoma, however, in, the, mesothelae, which, are, regarded, as, the, most, basal, living, spiders, the, ganglia, of, the, opisthosoma, and, the, rear, part, of, the, prosoma, remain, unfused, and, in, scorpions, the, ganglia, of, the, cephalothorax, are, fused, but, the, abdomen, retains, separate, pairs, of, ganglia, as, with, other, arthropods, chelicerates, cuticles, would, block, out, information, about, the, outside, world, except, that, they, are, penetrated, by, many, sensors, or, connections, from, sensors, to, the, nervous, system, in, fact, spiders, and, other, arthropods, have, modified, their, cuticles, into, elaborate, arrays, of, sensors, various, touch, and, vibration, sensors, mostly, bristles, called, setae, respond, to, different, levels, of, force, from, strong, contact, to, very, weak, air, currents, chemical, sensors, provide, equivalents, of, taste, and, smell, often, by, means, of, setae, living, chelicerates, have, both, compound, eyes, only, in, horseshoe, crabs, as, the, compound, eye, in, the, other, clades, has, been, reduced, to, a, cluster, of, no, more, than, five, pairs, of, ocelli, mounted, on, the, sides, of, the, head, plus, pigment, cup, ocelli, little, eyes, mounted, in, the, middle, these, median, ocelli, type, eyes, in, chelicerates, are, assumed, to, be, homologous, with, the, crustacean, nauplius, eyes, and, the, insect, ocelli, the, eyes, of, horseshoe, crabs, can, detect, movement, but, not, form, images, at, the, other, extreme, jumping, spiders, have, a, very, wide, field, of, vision, and, their, main, eyes, are, ten, times, as, acute, as, those, of, dragonflies, able, to, see, in, both, colors, and, uv, light, horseshoe, crabs, use, external, fertilization, the, sperm, and, ova, meet, outside, the, parents, bodies, despite, being, aquatic, they, spawn, on, land, in, the, intertidal, zone, on, the, beach, the, female, digs, a, depression, in, the, wet, sand, where, she, will, release, her, eggs, the, male, usually, more, than, one, then, releases, his, sperm, onto, them, their, trilobite, like, larvae, look, rather, like, miniature, adults, as, they, have, full, sets, of, appendages, and, eyes, but, initially, they, have, only, two, pairs, of, book, gills, and, gain, three, more, pairs, as, they, molt, also, the, sea, spiders, have, external, fertilization, the, male, and, female, release, their, sperm, and, eggs, into, the, water, where, fertilization, occurs, the, male, then, collects, the, eggs, and, carries, them, around, under, his, body, being, air, breathing, animals, although, many, mites, have, become, secondary, aquatic, the, arachnids, use, internal, fertilization, except, for, opiliones, and, some, mites, where, the, male, have, a, penis, used, for, direct, fertilization, fertilization, in, arachnids, is, indirect, indirect, fertilization, happens, in, two, ways, the, male, deposit, his, spermatophore, package, of, sperm, on, the, ground, which, is, then, picked, up, by, the, female, or, the, male, store, his, sperm, in, appendages, modified, into, sperm, transfer, organs, such, as, the, pedipalps, in, male, spiders, which, is, inserted, into, the, female, genital, openings, during, copulation, courtship, rituals, are, common, especially, in, species, where, the, male, risk, being, eaten, before, mating, most, arachnids, lay, eggs, but, all, scorpions, and, some, mites, are, viviparous, giving, birth, to, live, young, even, more, mites, are, ovoviviparous, but, most, are, oviparous, female, pseudoscorpions, carry, their, eggs, in, a, brood, pouch, on, the, belly, where, the, growing, embryos, feeds, on, a, nutritive, fluid, provided, by, the, mother, during, development, and, are, therefore, matrotrophic, levels, of, parental, care, for, the, young, range, from, zero, to, prolonged, scorpions, carry, their, young, on, their, backs, until, the, first, molt, and, in, a, few, semi, social, species, the, young, remain, with, their, mother, some, spiders, care, for, their, young, for, example, a, wolf, spider, s, brood, cling, to, rough, bristles, on, the, mother, s, back, and, females, of, some, species, respond, to, the, begging, behavior, of, their, young, by, giving, them, their, prey, provided, it, is, no, longer, struggling, or, even, regurgitate, food, there, are, large, gaps, in, the, chelicerates, fossil, record, because, like, all, arthropods, their, exoskeletons, are, organic, and, hence, their, fossils, are, rare, except, in, a, few, lagerst, tten, where, conditions, were, exceptionally, suited, to, preserving, fairly, soft, tissues, the, burgess, shale, animals, like, sidneyia, from, about, 505, million, years, ago, have, been, classified, as, chelicerates, the, latter, because, its, appendages, resemble, those, of, the, xiphosura, horseshoe, crabs, however, cladistic, analyses, that, consider, wider, ranges, of, characteristics, place, neither, as, chelicerates, there, is, debate, about, whether, fuxianhuia, from, earlier, in, the, cambrian, period, about, 525, million, years, ago, was, a, chelicerate, another, cambrian, fossil, kodymirus, was, originally, classified, as, an, aglaspid, but, may, have, been, a, eurypterid, and, therefore, a, chelicerate, if, any, of, these, was, closely, related, to, chelicerates, there, is, a, gap, of, at, least, 43, million, years, in, the, record, between, true, chelicerates, and, their, nearest, not, quite, chelicerate, relatives, sanctacaris, member, of, the, family, sanctacarididae, from, the, burgess, shale, of, canada, represents, the, oldest, occurrence, of, a, confirmed, chelicerate, middle, cambrian, in, age, although, its, chelicerate, nature, has, been, doubted, for, its, pattern, of, tagmosis, how, the, segments, are, grouped, especially, in, the, head, a, restudy, in, 2014, confirmed, its, phylogenetic, position, as, the, oldest, chelicerate, another, fossil, of, the, site, mollisonia, is, considered, a, basal, chelicerate, and, it, has, the, oldest, known, chelicerae, and, proto, book, gills, the, eurypterids, have, left, few, good, fossils, and, one, of, the, earliest, confirmed, eurypterid, pentecopterus, decorahensis, appears, in, the, middle, ordovician, period, 467, 3, million, years, ago, making, it, the, oldest, eurypterid, until, recently, the, earliest, known, xiphosuran, fossil, dated, from, the, late, llandovery, stage, of, the, silurian, 436, to, 428, million, years, ago, but, in, 2008, an, older, specimen, described, as, lunataspis, aurora, was, reported, from, about, 445, million, years, ago, in, the, late, ordovician, the, oldest, known, arachnid, is, the, trigonotarbid, palaeotarbus, jerami, from, about, 420, million, years, ago, in, the, silurian, period, and, had, a, triangular, cephalothorax, and, segmented, abdomen, as, well, as, eight, legs, and, a, pair, of, pedipalps, attercopus, fimbriunguis, from, 386, million, years, ago, in, the, devonian, period, bears, the, earliest, known, silk, producing, spigots, and, was, therefore, hailed, as, a, spider, but, it, lacked, spinnerets, and, hence, was, not, a, true, spider, rather, it, was, likely, sister, group, to, the, spiders, a, clade, which, has, been, named, serikodiastida, close, relatives, of, the, group, survived, through, to, the, cretaceous, period, several, carboniferous, spiders, were, members, of, the, mesothelae, a, basal, group, now, represented, only, by, the, liphistiidae, and, fossils, suggest, taxa, closely, related, to, the, spiders, but, which, were, not, true, members, of, the, group, were, also, present, during, this, period, the, late, silurian, proscorpius, has, been, classified, as, a, scorpion, but, differed, significantly, from, modern, scorpions, it, appears, wholly, aquatic, since, it, had, gills, rather, than, book, lungs, or, tracheae, its, mouth, was, completely, under, its, head, and, almost, between, the, first, pair, of, legs, as, in, the, extinct, eurypterids, and, living, horseshoe, crabs, fossils, of, terrestrial, scorpions, with, book, lungs, have, been, found, in, early, devonian, rocks, from, about, 402, million, years, ago, the, oldest, species, of, scorpion, found, as, of, 2021, is, dolichophonus, loudonensis, which, lived, during, the, silurian, in, present, day, scotland, hexapoda, crustacea, myriapoda, chelicerata, chelicerata, crustacea, trilobita, hexapoda, myriapoda, the, traditional, view, of, the, arthropod, family, tree, shows, chelicerates, as, less, closely, related, to, the, other, major, living, groups, crustaceans, hexapods, which, includes, insects, and, myriapods, which, includes, centipedes, and, millipedes, than, these, other, groups, are, to, each, other, recent, research, since, 2001, using, both, molecular, phylogenetics, the, application, of, cladistic, analysis, to, biochemistry, especially, to, organisms, dna, and, rna, and, detailed, examination, of, how, various, arthropods, nervous, systems, develop, in, the, embryos, suggests, that, chelicerates, are, most, closely, related, to, myriapods, while, hexapods, and, crustaceans, are, each, other, s, closest, relatives, however, these, results, are, derived, from, analyzing, only, living, arthropods, and, including, extinct, ones, such, as, trilobites, causes, a, swing, back, to, the, traditional, view, placing, trilobites, as, the, sister, group, of, the, tracheata, hexapods, plus, myriapods, and, chelicerates, as, least, closely, related, to, the, other, groups, xiphosura, horseshoe, crabs, eurypterida, chasmataspidida, scorpiones, opiliones, harvestmen, pseudoscorpiones, solifugae, sun, spiders, palpigradi, microwhip, scorpions, trigonotarbida, araneae, spiders, haptopoda, amblypygi, whip, spiders, uropygi, whip, scorpions, schizomida, ricinulei, hooded, tickspiders, anactinotrichida, acariformes, mites, it, is, generally, agreed, that, the, chelicerata, contain, the, classes, arachnida, spiders, scorpions, mites, etc, xiphosura, horseshoe, crabs, and, eurypterida, sea, scorpions, extinct, the, extinct, chasmataspidida, may, be, a, sub, group, within, eurypterida, the, pycnogonida, sea, spiders, were, traditionally, classified, as, chelicerates, but, some, features, suggest, they, may, be, representatives, of, the, earliest, arthropods, from, which, the, well, known, groups, such, as, chelicerates, evolved, however, the, structure, of, family, tree, relationships, within, the, chelicerata, has, been, controversial, ever, since, the, late, 19th, century, an, attempt, in, 2002, to, combine, analysis, of, dna, features, of, modern, chelicerates, and, anatomical, features, of, modern, and, fossil, ones, produced, credible, results, for, many, lower, level, groups, but, its, results, for, the, high, level, relationships, between, major, sub, groups, of, chelicerates, were, unstable, in, other, words, minor, changes, in, the, inputs, caused, significant, changes, in, the, outputs, of, the, computer, program, used, poy, an, analysis, in, 2007, using, only, anatomical, features, produced, the, cladogram, on, the, right, but, also, noted, that, many, uncertainties, remain, in, recent, analyses, the, clade, tetrapulmonata, is, reliably, recovered, but, other, ordinal, relationships, remain, in, flux, the, position, of, scorpions, is, particularly, controversial, some, early, fossils, such, as, the, late, silurian, proscorpius, have, been, classified, by, paleontologists, as, scorpions, but, described, as, wholly, aquatic, as, they, had, gills, rather, than, book, lungs, or, tracheae, their, mouths, are, also, completely, under, their, heads, and, almost, between, the, first, pair, of, legs, as, in, the, extinct, eurypterids, and, living, horseshoe, crabs, this, presents, a, difficult, choice, classify, proscorpius, and, other, aquatic, fossils, as, something, other, than, scorpions, despite, the, similarities, accept, that, scorpions, are, not, monophyletic, but, consist, of, separate, aquatic, and, terrestrial, groups, or, treat, scorpions, as, more, closely, related, to, eurypterids, and, possibly, horseshoe, crabs, than, to, spiders, and, other, arachnids, so, that, either, scorpions, are, not, arachnids, or, arachnids, are, not, monophyletic, cladistic, analyses, have, recovered, proscorpius, within, the, scorpions, based, on, reinterpretation, of, the, species, breathing, apparatus, this, is, reflected, also, in, the, reinterpretation, of, palaeoscorpius, as, a, terrestrial, animal, a, 2013, phylogenetic, analysis, the, results, presented, in, a, cladogram, below, on, the, relationships, within, the, xiphosura, and, the, relations, to, other, closely, related, groups, including, the, eurypterids, which, were, represented, in, the, analysis, by, genera, eurypterus, parastylonurus, rhenopterus, and, stoermeropterus, concluded, that, the, xiphosura, as, presently, understood, was, paraphyletic, a, group, sharing, a, last, common, ancestor, but, not, including, all, descendants, of, this, ancestor, and, thus, not, a, valid, phylogenetic, group, eurypterids, were, recovered, as, closely, related, to, arachnids, instead, of, xiphosurans, forming, the, group, sclerophorata, within, the, clade, dekatriata, composed, of, sclerophorates, and, chasmataspidids, this, work, suggested, it, is, possible, that, dekatriata, is, synonymous, with, sclerophorata, as, the, reproductive, system, the, primary, defining, feature, of, sclerophorates, has, not, been, thoroughly, studied, in, chasmataspidids, dekatriata, is, in, turn, part, of, the, prosomapoda, a, group, including, the, xiphosurida, the, only, monophyletic, xiphosuran, group, and, other, stem, genera, a, recent, phylogenetic, analysis, of, the, chelicerates, places, the, xiphosura, within, the, arachnida, as, the, sister, group, of, ricinulei, but, others, still, retrieve, a, monophyletic, arachnida, fuxianhuia, emeraldella, trilobitomorpha, sidneyia, yohoia, alalcomenaeus, leanchoilia, palaeoisopus, pycnogonum, haliestes, offacolus, weinbergina, venustulus, camanchia, legrandella, kasibelinurus, willwerathia, lunataspis, belinurina, limulina, pseudoniscus, cyamocephalus, pasternakevia, bunodes, limuloides, bembicosoma, chasmataspidida, arachnida, eurypterida, although, well, behind, the, insects, chelicerates, are, one, of, the, most, diverse, groups, of, animals, with, over, 77, 000, living, species, that, have, been, described, in, scientific, publications, some, estimates, suggest, that, there, may, be, 130, 000, undescribed, species, of, spider, and, nearly, 500, 000, undescribed, species, of, mites, and, ticks, while, the, earliest, chelicerates, and, the, living, pycnogonida, if, they, are, chelicerates, and, xiphosura, are, marine, animals, that, breathe, dissolved, oxygen, the, vast, majority, of, living, species, are, air, breathers, although, a, few, spider, species, build, diving, bell, webs, that, enable, them, to, live, under, water, like, their, ancestors, most, living, chelicerates, are, carnivores, mainly, on, small, invertebrates, however, many, species, feed, as, parasites, herbivores, scavengers, and, detritivores, in, the, past, native, americans, ate, the, flesh, of, horseshoe, crabs, and, used, the, tail, spines, as, spear, tips, and, the, shells, to, bail, water, out, of, their, canoes, more, recent, attempts, to, use, horseshoe, crabs, as, food, for, livestock, were, abandoned, when, it, was, found, that, this, gave, the, meat, a, bad, taste, horseshoe, crab, blood, contains, a, clotting, agent, limulus, amebocyte, lysate, which, is, used, to, test, antibiotics, and, kidney, machines, to, ensure, that, they, are, free, of, dangerous, bacteria, and, to, detect, spinal, meningitis, and, some, cancers, cooked, tarantula, spiders, are, considered, a, delicacy, in, cambodia, and, by, the, piaroa, indians, of, southern, venezuela, spider, venoms, may, be, a, less, polluting, alternative, to, conventional, pesticides, as, they, are, deadly, to, insects, but, the, great, majority, are, harmless, to, vertebrates, possible, medical, uses, for, spider, venoms, are, being, investigated, for, the, treatment, of, cardiac, arrhythmia, alzheimer, s, disease, strokes, and, erectile, dysfunction, because, spider, silk, is, both, light, and, very, strong, but, large, scale, harvesting, from, spiders, is, impractical, work, is, being, done, to, produce, it, in, other, organisms, by, means, of, genetic, engineering, spider, silk, proteins, have, been, successfully, produced, in, transgenic, goats, milk, tobacco, leaves, silkworms, and, bacteria, and, recombinant, spider, silk, is, now, available, as, a, commercial, product, from, some, biotechnology, companies, in, the, 20th, century, there, were, about, 100, reliably, reported, deaths, from, spider, bites, compared, with, 1, 500, from, jellyfish, stings, scorpion, stings, are, thought, to, be, a, significant, danger, in, less, developed, countries, for, example, they, cause, about, 1, 000, deaths, per, year, in, mexico, but, only, one, every, few, years, in, the, usa, most, of, these, incidents, are, caused, by, accidental, human, invasions, of, scorpions, nests, on, the, other, hand, medical, uses, of, scorpion, venom, are, being, investigated, for, treatment, of, brain, cancers, and, bone, diseases, ticks, are, parasitic, and, some, transmit, micro, organisms, and, parasites, that, can, cause, diseases, in, humans, while, the, saliva, of, a, few, species, can, directly, cause, tick, paralysis, if, they, are, not, removed, within, a, day, or, two, a, few, of, the, closely, related, mites, also, infest, humans, some, causing, intense, itching, by, their, bites, and, others, by, burrowing, into, the, skin, species, that, normally, infest, other, animals, such, as, rodents, may, infest, humans, if, their, normal, hosts, are, eliminated, three, species, of, mite, are, a, threat, to, honey, bees, and, one, of, these, varroa, destructor, has, become, the, largest, single, problem, faced, by, beekeepers, worldwide, mites, cause, several, forms, of, allergic, diseases, including, hay, fever, asthma, and, eczema, and, they, aggravate, atopic, dermatitis, mites, are, also, significant, crop, pests, although, predatory, mites, may, be, useful, in, controlling, some, of, these
