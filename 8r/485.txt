characiformes, k, r, s, f, r, m, i, z, is, an, order, of, ray, finned, fish, comprising, the, characins, and, their, allies, grouped, in, 18, recognized, families, more, than, 2000, different, species, are, described, including, the, well, known, piranha, and, tetras, the, characiformes, form, part, of, a, series, called, the, otophysi, within, the, superorder, ostariophysi, the, otophysi, contain, three, other, orders, cypriniformes, siluriformes, and, gymnotiformes, the, characiformes, form, a, group, known, as, the, characiphysi, with, the, siluriformes, and, gymnotiformes, the, order, characiformes, is, the, sister, group, to, the, orders, siluriformes, and, gymnotiformes, though, this, has, been, debated, in, light, of, recent, molecular, evidence, originally, the, characins, were, all, grouped, within, a, single, family, the, characidae, since, then, 18, different, families, have, been, separated, out, however, classification, varies, somewhat, and, the, most, recent, 2011, study, confirms, the, circumscribed, characidae, as, monophyletic, currently, 18, families, about, 270, genera, and, at, least, 1674, species, are, known, the, suborder, citharinoidei, which, contains, the, families, distichodontidae, and, citharinidae, is, considered, the, sister, group, to, the, rest, of, the, characins, suborder, characoidei, this, group, has, a, very, ancient, divergence, from, the, rest, of, the, characiformes, dating, back, to, the, early, cretaceous, or, earlier, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, it, be, better, treated, as, its, own, order, the, cithariniformes, the, characiformes, likely, first, originated, and, diversified, on, the, supercontinent, of, west, gondwana, composed, of, modern, africa, and, south, america, during, the, cretaceous, period, though, fossils, are, poorly, known, during, the, cretaceous, period, the, rift, between, south, america, and, africa, would, be, forming, this, may, explain, the, contrast, in, diversity, between, the, two, continents, their, low, diversity, in, africa, may, explain, why, some, primitive, fish, families, and, the, cypriniformes, coexist, with, them, whereas, they, are, absent, in, south, america, where, these, fish, may, have, been, driven, extinct, the, characiforms, had, not, spread, into, africa, soon, enough, to, also, reach, the, land, connection, between, africa, and, asia, the, earliest, they, could, have, spread, into, central, america, was, the, late, miocene, the, earliest, characiform, fossils, date, back, to, the, late, cretaceous, around, the, santonian, other, fossil, teeth, date, back, to, the, cenomanian, of, morocco, but, it, has, been, suggested, that, these, teeth, may, be, of, early, ginglymodians, previously, the, oldest, characiform, was, assumed, to, be, santanichthys, of, the, early, cretaceous, albian, age, of, brazil, this, presumably, marine, taxon, was, used, as, evidence, of, characiformes, potentially, having, marine, origins, however, more, recent, studies, indicate, that, santanaichthys, is, likely, a, basal, otophysan, rather, than, a, characiform, similarly, salminops, from, spain, and, sorbinicharax, from, italy, previously, also, considered, potential, marine, characiforms, are, now, thought, to, have, no, characiform, affinities, and, are, considered, indeterminate, teleosts, given, this, there, is, no, paleontological, support, for, characiforms, having, marine, origins, uniquely, late, cretaceous, characiform, fossils, are, found, significantly, north, of, their, modern, distribution, indeterminate, characiform, teeth, are, known, from, the, santonian, of, hungary, and, maastrichtian, of, france, which, have, a, large, multi, cusped, appearance, reminiscent, of, african, alestids, similarly, two, campanian, freshwater, characiform, genera, primuluchara, and, eotexachara, are, known, from, north, america, with, primuluchara, having, a, very, wide, distribution, across, laramidia, ranging, from, texas, to, as, far, north, as, southern, canada, dinosaur, park, formation, it, is, likely, that, the, warmer, conditions, of, the, late, cretaceous, allowed, early, characins, to, range, farther, north, than, the, present, day, with, african, characins, colonizing, europe, and, south, american, characins, colonizing, north, america, early, characins, may, have, had, some, level, of, salt, tolerance, allowing, for, such, colonizations, to, take, place, within, their, modern, distribution, a, number, of, modern, south, american, characin, families, have, their, earliest, occurrences, in, the, maastrichtian, of, bolivia, with, isolated, teeth, and, skeletal, elements, identifiable, to, acestrorhynchidae, characidae, and, serrasalmidae, below, is, a,

connecting, the, swim, bladder, and, inner, ear, superficially, the, characiformes, somewhat, resemble, their, relatives, of, the, order, cypriniformes, but, have, a, small, fleshy, adipose, fin, between, the, dorsal, fin, and, tail, most, species, have, teeth, within, the, mouth, since, they, are, often, carnivorous, the, body, is, almost, always, covered, in, well, defined, scales, the, mouth, is, also, usually, not, truly, protractile, the, largest, characins, are, hydrocynus, goliath, and, salminus, franciscanus, and, hoplias, aimara, both, of, which, are, up, to, 1, 2, m, 3, 9, ft, the, smallest, in, size, is, about, 1, 7, cm, 0, 67, in, in, the, bolivian, pygmy, blue, characin, xenurobrycon, polyancistrus, many, members, are, under, 3, cm, 1, 2, in, characins, are, most, diverse, in, the, neotropics, where, they, are, found, in, lakes, and, rivers, throughout, most, of, south, and, central, america, the, red, bellied, piranha, a, member, of, the, family, serrasalmidae, within, the, characiformes, is, endemic, to, the, neotropical, realm, at, least, 209, species, of, characins, are, found, in, africa, including, the, distichodontids, citharinids, alestids, and, hepsetids, the, rest, of, the, characins, originate, from, the, americas, a, few, characins, become, quite, large, and, are, important, as, food, or, game, most, however, are, small, shoaling, fish, many, species, commonly, called, tetras, are, popular, in, aquaria, because, of, their, bright, colors, general, hardiness, and, tolerance, towards, other, fish, in, community, tanks
