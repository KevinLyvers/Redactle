sustainability, is, a, social, goal, for, people, to, co, exist, on, earth, over, a, long, period, of, time, definitions, of, this, term, are, disputed, and, have, varied, with, literature, context, and, time, sustainability, usually, has, three, dimensions, or, pillars, environmental, economic, and, social, many, definitions, emphasize, the, environmental, dimension, this, can, include, addressing, key, environmental, problems, including, climate, change, and, biodiversity, loss, the, idea, of, sustainability, can, guide, decisions, at, the, global, national, organizational, and, individual, levels, a, related, concept, is, that, of, sustainable, development, and, the, terms, are, often, used, to, mean, the, same, thing, unesco, distinguishes, the, two, like, this, sustainability, is, often, thought, of, as, a, long, term, goal, i, e, a, more, sustainable, world, while, sustainable, development, refers, to, the, many, processes, and, pathways, to, achieve, it, details, around, the, economic, dimension, of, sustainability, are, controversial, scholars, have, discussed, this, under, the, concept, of, weak, and, strong, sustainability, for, example, there, will, always, be, tension, between, the, ideas, of, welfare, and, prosperity, for, all, and, environmental, conservation, so, trade, offs, are, necessary, it, would, be, desirable, to, find, ways, that, separate, economic, growth, from, harming, the, environment, this, means, using, fewer, resources, per, unit, of, output, even, while, growing, the, economy, this, decoupling, reduces, the, environmental, impact, of, economic, growth, such, as, pollution, doing, this, is, difficult, some, experts, say, there, is, no, evidence, that, such, a, decoupling, is, happening, at, the, required, scale, it, is, challenging, to, measure, sustainability, as, the, concept, is, complex, contextual, and, dynamic, indicators, have, been, developed, to, cover, the, environment, society, or, the, economy, but, there, is, no, fixed, definition, of, sustainability, indicators, the, metrics, are, evolving, and, include, indicators, benchmarks, and, audits, they, include, sustainability, standards, and, certification, systems, like, fairtrade, and, organic, they, also, involve, indices, and, accounting, systems, such, as, corporate, sustainability, reporting, and, triple, bottom, line, accounting, it, is, necessary, to, address, many, barriers, to, sustainability, to, achieve, a, sustainability, transition, 34, some, barriers, arise, from, nature, and, its, complexity, while, others, are, extrinsic, to, the, concept, of, sustainability, for, example, they, can, result, from, the, dominant, institutional, frameworks, in, countries, global, issues, of, sustainability, are, difficult, to, tackle, as, they, need, global, solutions, existing, global, organizations, such, as, the, un, and, wto, are, seen, as, inefficient, in, enforcing, current, global, regulations, one, reason, for, this, is, the, lack, of, suitable, sanctioning, mechanisms, 135, 145, governments, are, not, the, only, sources, of, action, for, sustainability, for, example, business, groups, have, tried, to, integrate, ecological, concerns, with, economic, activity, seeking, sustainable, business, religious, leaders, have, stressed, the, need, for, caring, for, nature, and, environmental, stability, individuals, can, also, live, more, sustainably, some, people, have, criticized, the, idea, of, sustainability, one, point, of, criticism, is, that, the, concept, is, vague, and, only, a, buzzword, another, is, that, sustainability, might, be, an, impossible, goal, some, experts, have, pointed, out, that, no, country, is, delivering, what, its, citizens, need, without, transgressing, the, biophysical, planetary, boundaries, 11, sustainability, is, regarded, as, a, normative, concept, this, means, it, is, based, on, what, people, value, or, find, desirable, the, quest, for, sustainability, involves, connecting, what, is, known, through, scientific, study, to, applications, in, pursuit, of, what, people, want, for, the, future, the, 1983, un, commission, on, environment, and, development, brundtland, commission, had, a, big, influence, on, the, use, of, the, term, sustainability, today, the, commission, s, 1987, brundtland, report, provided, a, definition, of, sustainable, development, the, report, our, common, future, defines, it, as, development, that, meets, the, needs, of, the, present, without, compromising, the, ability, of, future, generations, to, meet, their, own, needs, the, report, helped, bring, sustainability, into, the, mainstream, of, policy, discussions, it, also, popularized, the, concept, of, sustainable, development, some, other, key, concepts, to, illustrate, the, meaning, of, sustainability, include, in, everyday, usage, sustainability, often, focuses, on, the, environmental, dimension, scholars, say, that, a, single, specific, definition, of, sustainability, may, never, be, possible, but, the, concept, is, still, useful, there, have, been, attempts, to, define, it, for, example, some, definitions, focus, on, the, environmental, dimension, the, oxford, dictionary, of, english, defines, sustainability, as, the, property, of, being, environmentally, sustainable, the, degree, to, which, a, process, or, enterprise, is, able, to, be, maintained, or, continued, while, avoiding, the, long, term, depletion, of, natural, resources, the, term, sustainability, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, sustinere, to, sustain, can, mean, to, maintain, support, uphold, or, endure, so, sustainability, is, the, ability, to, continue, over, a, long, period, of, time, in, the, past, sustainability, referred, to, environmental, sustainability, it, meant, using, natural, resources, so, that, people, in, the, future, could, continue, to, rely, on, them, in, the, long, term, the, concept, of, sustainability, or, nachhaltigkeit, in, german, goes, back, to, hans, carl, von, carlowitz, 1645, 1714, and, applied, to, forestry, the, term, for, this, now, would, be, sustainable, forest, management, he, used, this, term, to, mean, the, long, term, responsible, use, of, a, natural, resource, in, his, 1713, work, silvicultura, oeconomica, he, wrote, that, the, highest, art, science, industriousness, will, consist, in, such, a, conservation, and, replanting, of, timber, that, there, can, be, a, continuous, ongoing, and, sustainable, use, the, shift, in, use, of, sustainability, from, preservation, of, forests, for, future, wood, production, to, broader, preservation, of, environmental, resources, to, sustain, the, world, for, future, generations, traces, to, a, 1972, book, by, ernst, basler, based, on, a, series, of, lectures, at, m, i, t, the, idea, itself, goes, back, a, very, long, time, communities, have, always, worried, about, the, capacity, of, their, environment, to, sustain, them, in, the, long, term, many, ancient, cultures, traditional, societies, and, indigenous, peoples, have, restricted, the, use, of, natural, resources, the, terms, sustainability, and, sustainable, development, are, closely, related, in, fact, they, are, often, used, to, mean, the, same, thing, both, terms, are, linked, with, the, three, dimensions, of, sustainability, concept, one, distinction, is, that, sustainability, is, a, general, concept, while, sustainable, development, can, be, a, policy, or, organizing, principle, scholars, say, sustainability, is, a, broader, concept, because, sustainable, development, focuses, mainly, on, human, well, being, sustainable, development, has, two, linked, goals, it, aims, to, meet, human, development, goals, it, also, aims, to, enable, natural, systems, to, provide, the, natural, resources, and, ecosystem, services, needed, for, economies, and, society, the, concept, of, sustainable, development, has, come, to, focus, on, economic, development, social, development, and, environmental, protection, for, future, generations, scholars, usually, distinguish, three, different, areas, of, sustainability, these, are, the, environmental, the, social, and, the, economic, several, terms, are, in, use, for, this, concept, authors, may, speak, of, three, pillars, dimensions, components, aspects, perspectives, factors, or, goals, all, mean, the, same, thing, in, this, context, the, three, dimensions, paradigm, has, few, theoretical, foundations, the, popular, three, intersecting, circles, or, venn, diagram, representing, sustainability, first, appeared, in, a, 1987, article, by, the, economist, edward, barbier, scholars, rarely, question, the, distinction, itself, the, idea, of, sustainability, with, three, dimensions, is, a, dominant, interpretation, in, the, literature, in, the, brundtland, report, the, environment, and, development, are, inseparable, and, go, together, in, the, search, for, sustainability, it, described, sustainable, development, as, a, global, concept, linking, environmental, and, social, issues, it, added, sustainable, development, is, important, for, both, developing, countries, and, industrialized, countries, the, environment, is, where, we, all, live, and, development, is, what, we, all, do, in, attempting, to, improve, our, lot, within, that, abode, the, two, are, inseparable, we, came, to, see, that, a, new, development, path, was, required, one, that, sustained, human, progress, not, just, in, a, few, pieces, for, a, few, years, but, for, the, entire, planet, into, the, distant, future, thus, sustainable, development, becomes, a, goal, not, just, for, the, developing, nations, but, for, industrial, ones, as, well, the, rio, declaration, from, 1992, is, seen, as, the, foundational, instrument, in, the, move, towards, sustainability, 29, it, includes, specific, references, to, ecosystem, integrity, 31, the, plan, associated, with, carrying, out, the, rio, declaration, also, discusses, sustainability, in, this, way, the, plan, agenda, 21, talks, about, economic, social, and, environmental, dimensions, 8, 6, countries, could, develop, systems, for, monitoring, and, evaluation, of, progress, towards, achieving, sustainable, development, by, adopting, indicators, that, measure, changes, across, economic, social, and, environmental, dimensions, agenda, 2030, from, 2015, also, viewed, sustainability, in, this, way, it, sees, the, 17, sustainable, development, goals, sdgs, with, their, 169, targets, as, balancing, the, three, dimensions, of, sustainable, development, the, economic, social, and, environmental, scholars, have, discussed, how, to, rank, the, three, dimensions, of, sustainability, many, publications, state, that, the, environmental, dimension, is, the, most, important, planetary, integrity, or, ecological, integrity, are, other, terms, for, the, environmental, dimension, protecting, ecological, integrity, is, the, core, of, sustainability, according, to, many, experts, if, this, is, the, case, then, its, environmental, dimension, sets, limits, to, economic, and, social, development, the, diagram, with, three, nested, ellipses, is, one, way, of, showing, the, three, dimensions, of, sustainability, together, with, a, hierarchy, it, gives, the, environmental, dimension, a, special, status, in, this, diagram, the, environment, includes, society, and, society, includes, economic, conditions, thus, it, stresses, a, hierarchy, another, model, shows, the, three, dimensions, in, a, similar, way, in, this, sdg, wedding, cake, model, the, economy, is, a, smaller, subset, of, the, societal, system, and, the, societal, system, in, turn, is, a, smaller, subset, of, the, biosphere, system, in, 2022, an, assessment, examined, the, political, impacts, of, the, sustainable, development, goals, the, assessment, found, that, the, integrity, of, the, earth, s, life, support, systems, was, essential, for, sustainability, 140, the, authors, said, that, the, sdgs, fail, to, recognize, that, planetary, people, and, prosperity, concerns, are, all, part, of, one, earth, system, and, that, the, protection, of, planetary, integrity, should, not, be, a, means, to, an, end, but, an, end, in, itself, 147, the, aspect, of, environmental, protection, is, not, an, explicit, priority, for, the, sdgs, this, causes, problems, as, it, could, encourage, countries, to, give, the, environment, less, weight, in, their, developmental, plans, 144, the, authors, state, that, sustainability, on, a, planetary, scale, is, only, achievable, under, an, overarching, planetary, integrity, goal, that, recognizes, the, biophysical, limits, of, the, planet, 161, other, frameworks, bypass, the, compartmentalization, of, sustainability, into, separate, dimensions, completely, the, environmental, dimension, is, central, to, the, overall, concept, of, sustainability, people, became, more, and, more, aware, of, environmental, pollution, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, this, led, to, discussions, on, sustainability, and, sustainable, development, this, process, began, in, the, 1970s, with, concern, for, environmental, issues, these, included, natural, ecosystems, or, natural, resources, and, the, human, environment, it, later, extended, to, all, systems, that, support, life, on, earth, including, human, society, 31, reducing, these, negative, impacts, on, the, environment, would, improve, environmental, sustainability, environmental, pollution, is, not, a, new, phenomenon, but, it, has, been, only, a, local, or, regional, concern, for, most, of, human, history, awareness, of, global, environmental, issues, increased, in, the, 20th, century, 5, the, harmful, effects, and, global, spread, of, pesticides, like, ddt, came, under, scrutiny, in, the, 1960s, in, the, 1970s, it, emerged, that, chlorofluorocarbons, cfcs, were, depleting, the, ozone, layer, this, led, to, the, de, facto, ban, of, cfcs, with, the, montreal, protocol, in, 1987, 146, in, the, early, 20th, century, arrhenius, discussed, the, effect, of, greenhouse, gases, on, the, climate, see, also, history, of, climate, change, science, climate, change, due, to, human, activity, became, an, academic, and, political, topic, several, decades, later, this, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, ipcc, in, 1988, and, the, unfccc, in, 1992, in, 1972, the, un, conference, on, the, human, environment, took, place, it, was, the, first, un, conference, on, environmental, issues, it, stated, it, was, important, to, protect, and, improve, the, human, environment, 3, it, emphasized, the, need, to, protect, wildlife, and, natural, habitats, 4, the, natural, resources, of, the, earth, including, the, air, water, land, flora, and, fauna, and, natural, ecosystems, must, be, safeguarded, for, the, benefit, of, present, and, future, generations, through, careful, planning, or, management, as, appropriate, in, 2000, the, un, launched, eight, millennium, development, goals, the, aim, was, for, the, global, community, to, achieve, them, by, 2015, goal, 7, was, to, ensure, environmental, sustainability, but, this, goal, did, not, mention, the, concepts, of, social, or, economic, sustainability, specific, problems, often, dominate, public, discussion, of, the, environmental, dimension, of, sustainability, in, the, 21st, century, these, problems, have, included, climate, change, biodiversity, and, pollution, other, global, problems, are, loss, of, ecosystem, services, land, degradation, environmental, impacts, of, animal, agriculture, and, air, and, water, pollution, including, marine, plastic, pollution, and, ocean, acidification, many, people, worry, about, human, impacts, on, the, environment, these, include, impacts, on, the, atmosphere, land, and, water, resources, 21, human, activities, now, have, an, impact, on, earth, s, geology, and, ecosystems, this, led, paul, crutzen, to, call, the, current, geological, epoch, the, anthropocene, the, economic, dimension, of, sustainability, is, controversial, this, is, because, the, term, development, within, sustainable, development, can, be, interpreted, in, different, ways, some, may, take, it, to, mean, only, economic, development, and, growth, this, can, promote, an, economic, system, that, is, bad, for, the, environment, others, focus, more, on, the, trade, offs, between, environmental, conservation, and, achieving, welfare, goals, for, basic, needs, food, water, health, and, shelter, economic, development, can, indeed, reduce, hunger, or, energy, poverty, this, is, especially, the, case, in, the, least, developed, countries, that, is, why, sustainable, development, goal, 8, calls, for, economic, growth, to, drive, social, progress, and, well, being, its, first, target, is, for, at, least, 7, per, cent, gdp, growth, per, annum, in, the, least, developed, countries, however, the, challenge, is, to, expand, economic, activities, while, reducing, their, environmental, impact, 8, in, other, words, humanity, will, have, to, find, ways, how, societal, progress, potentially, by, economic, development, can, be, reached, without, excess, strain, on, the, environment, the, brundtland, report, says, poverty, causes, environmental, problems, poverty, also, results, from, them, so, addressing, environmental, problems, requires, understanding, the, factors, behind, world, poverty, and, inequality, section, i, 1, 8, the, report, demands, a, new, development, path, for, sustained, human, progress, it, highlights, that, this, is, a, goal, for, both, developing, and, industrialized, nations, section, i, 1, 10, unep, and, undp, launched, the, poverty, environment, initiative, in, 2005, which, has, three, goals, these, are, reducing, extreme, poverty, greenhouse, gas, emissions, and, net, natural, asset, loss, this, guide, to, structural, reform, will, enable, countries, to, achieve, the, sdgs, 11, it, should, also, show, how, to, address, the, trade, offs, between, ecological, footprint, and, economic, development, 82, the, social, dimension, of, sustainability, is, not, well, defined, one, definition, states, that, a, society, is, sustainable, in, social, terms, if, people, do, not, face, structural, obstacles, in, key, areas, these, key, areas, are, health, influence, competence, impartiality, and, meaning, making, some, scholars, place, social, issues, at, the, very, center, of, discussions, they, suggest, that, all, the, domains, of, sustainability, are, social, these, include, ecological, economic, political, and, cultural, sustainability, these, domains, all, depend, on, the, relationship, between, the, social, and, the, natural, the, ecological, domain, is, defined, as, human, embeddedness, in, the, environment, from, this, perspective, social, sustainability, encompasses, all, human, activities, it, goes, beyond, the, intersection, of, economics, the, environment, and, the, social, there, are, many, broad, strategies, for, more, sustainable, social, systems, they, include, improved, education, and, the, political, empowerment, of, women, this, is, especially, the, case, in, developing, countries, they, include, greater, regard, for, social, justice, this, involves, equity, between, rich, and, poor, both, within, and, between, countries, and, it, includes, intergenerational, equity, providing, more, social, safety, nets, to, vulnerable, populations, would, contribute, to, social, sustainability, 11, a, society, with, a, high, degree, of, social, sustainability, would, lead, to, livable, communities, with, a, good, quality, of, life, being, fair, diverse, connected, and, democratic, indigenous, communities, might, have, a, focus, on, particular, aspects, of, sustainability, for, example, spiritual, aspects, community, based, governance, and, an, emphasis, on, place, and, locality, some, experts, have, proposed, further, dimensions, these, could, cover, institutional, cultural, political, and, technical, dimensions, some, scholars, have, argued, for, a, fourth, dimension, they, say, the, traditional, three, dimensions, do, not, reflect, the, complexity, of, contemporary, society, for, example, agenda, 21, for, culture, and, the, united, cities, and, local, governments, argue, that, sustainable, development, should, include, a, solid, cultural, policy, they, also, advocate, for, a, cultural, dimension, in, all, public, policies, another, example, was, the, circles, of, sustainability, approach, which, included, cultural, sustainability, people, often, debate, the, relationship, between, the, environmental, and, economic, dimensions, of, sustainability, in, academia, this, is, discussed, under, the, term, weak, and, strong, sustainability, in, that, model, the, weak, sustainability, concept, states, that, capital, made, by, humans, could, replace, most, of, the, natural, capital, natural, capital, is, a, way, of, describing, environmental, resources, people, may, refer, to, it, as, nature, an, example, for, this, is, the, use, of, environmental, technologies, to, reduce, pollution, the, opposite, concept, in, that, model, is, strong, sustainability, this, assumes, that, nature, provides, functions, that, technology, cannot, replace, thus, strong, sustainability, acknowledges, the, need, to, preserve, ecological, integrity, 19, the, loss, of, those, functions, makes, it, impossible, to, recover, or, repair, many, resources, and, ecosystem, services, biodiversity, along, with, pollination, and, fertile, soils, are, examples, others, are, clean, air, clean, water, and, regulation, of, climate, systems, weak, sustainability, has, come, under, criticism, it, may, be, popular, with, governments, and, business, but, does, not, ensure, the, preservation, of, the, earth, s, ecological, integrity, this, is, why, the, environmental, dimension, is, so, important, the, world, economic, forum, illustrated, this, in, 2020, it, found, that, 44, trillion, of, economic, value, generation, depends, on, nature, this, value, more, than, half, of, the, world, s, gdp, is, thus, vulnerable, to, nature, loss, 8, three, large, economic, sectors, are, highly, dependent, on, nature, construction, agriculture, and, food, and, beverages, nature, loss, results, from, many, factors, they, include, land, use, change, sea, use, change, and, climate, change, other, examples, are, natural, resource, use, pollution, and, invasive, alien, species, 11, trade, offs, between, different, dimensions, of, sustainability, are, a, common, topic, for, debate, balancing, the, environmental, social, and, economic, dimensions, of, sustainability, is, difficult, this, is, because, there, is, often, disagreement, about, the, relative, importance, of, each, to, resolve, this, there, is, a, need, to, integrate, balance, and, reconcile, the, dimensions, for, example, humans, can, choose, to, make, ecological, integrity, a, priority, or, to, compromise, it, some, even, argue, the, sustainable, development, goals, are, unrealistic, their, aim, of, universal, human, well, being, conflicts, with, the, physical, limits, of, earth, and, its, ecosystems, 41, there, are, several, methods, to, measure, or, describe, human, impacts, on, earth, they, include, the, ecological, footprint, ecological, debt, carrying, capacity, and, sustainable, yield, the, idea, of, planetary, boundaries, is, that, there, are, limits, to, the, carrying, capacity, of, the, earth, it, is, important, not, to, cross, these, thresholds, to, prevent, irreversible, harm, to, the, earth, these, planetary, boundaries, involve, several, environmental, issues, these, include, climate, change, and, biodiversity, loss, they, also, include, types, of, pollution, these, are, biogeochemical, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, ocean, acidification, land, use, freshwater, ozone, depletion, atmospheric, aerosols, and, chemical, pollution, since, 2015, some, experts, refer, to, biodiversity, loss, as, change, in, biosphere, integrity, they, refer, to, chemical, pollution, as, introduction, of, novel, entities, the, ipat, formula, measures, the, environmental, impact, of, humans, it, emerged, in, the, 1970s, it, states, this, impact, is, proportional, to, human, population, affluence, and, technology, this, implies, various, ways, to, increase, environmental, sustainability, one, would, be, human, population, control, another, would, be, to, reduce, consumption, and, affluence, such, as, energy, consumption, another, would, be, to, develop, innovative, or, green, technologies, such, as, renewable, energy, in, other, words, there, are, two, broad, aims, the, first, would, be, to, have, fewer, consumers, the, second, would, be, to, have, less, environmental, footprint, per, consumer, the, millennium, ecosystem, assessment, from, 2005, measured, 24, ecosystem, services, it, concluded, that, only, four, have, improved, over, the, last, 50, years, it, found, 15, are, in, serious, decline, and, five, are, in, a, precarious, condition, 6, 19, experts, in, environmental, economics, have, calculated, the, cost, of, using, public, natural, resources, one, project, calculated, the, damage, to, ecosystems, and, biodiversity, loss, this, was, the, economics, of, ecosystems, and, biodiversity, project, from, 2007, to, 2011, an, entity, that, creates, environmental, and, social, costs, often, does, not, pay, for, them, the, market, price, also, does, not, reflect, those, costs, in, the, end, government, policy, is, usually, required, to, resolve, this, problem, decision, making, can, take, future, costs, and, benefits, into, account, the, tool, for, this, is, the, social, discount, rate, the, bigger, the, concern, for, future, generations, the, lower, the, social, discount, rate, should, be, another, approach, is, to, put, an, economic, value, on, ecosystem, services, this, allows, us, to, assess, environmental, damage, against, perceived, short, term, welfare, benefits, one, calculation, is, that, for, every, dollar, spent, on, ecosystem, restoration, between, three, and, 75, dollars, of, economic, benefits, from, ecosystem, goods, and, services, can, be, expected, in, recent, years, economist, kate, raworth, has, developed, the, concept, of, doughnut, economics, this, aims, to, integrate, social, and, environmental, sustainability, into, economic, thinking, the, social, dimension, acts, as, a, minimum, standard, to, which, a, society, should, aspire, the, carrying, capacity, of, the, planet, acts, an, outer, limit, there, are, many, reasons, why, sustainability, is, so, difficult, to, achieve, these, reasons, have, the, name, sustainability, barriers, before, addressing, these, barriers, it, is, important, to, analyze, and, understand, them, 34, some, barriers, arise, from, nature, and, its, complexity, everything, is, related, others, arise, from, the, human, condition, one, example, is, the, value, action, gap, this, reflects, the, fact, that, people, often, do, not, act, according, to, their, convictions, experts, describe, these, barriers, as, intrinsic, to, the, concept, of, sustainability, 81, other, barriers, are, extrinsic, to, the, concept, of, sustainability, this, means, it, is, possible, to, overcome, them, one, way, would, be, to, put, a, price, tag, on, the, consumption, of, public, goods, 84, some, extrinsic, barriers, relate, to, the, nature, of, dominant, institutional, frameworks, examples, would, be, where, market, mechanisms, fail, for, public, goods, existing, societies, economies, and, cultures, encourage, increased, consumption, there, is, a, structural, imperative, for, growth, in, competitive, market, economies, this, inhibits, necessary, societal, change, furthermore, there, are, several, barriers, related, to, the, difficulties, of, implementing, sustainability, policies, there, are, trade, offs, between, the, goals, of, environmental, policies, and, economic, development, environmental, goals, include, nature, conservation, development, may, focus, on, poverty, reduction, 65, there, are, also, trade, offs, between, short, term, profit, and, long, term, viability, 65, political, pressures, generally, favor, the, short, term, over, the, long, term, so, they, form, a, barrier, to, actions, oriented, toward, improving, sustainability, 86, barriers, to, sustainability, may, also, reflect, current, trends, these, could, include, consumerism, and, short, termism, 86, the, european, environment, agency, defines, a, sustainability, transition, as, a, fundamental, and, wide, ranging, transformation, of, a, socio, technical, system, towards, a, more, sustainable, configuration, that, helps, alleviate, persistent, problems, such, as, climate, change, pollution, biodiversity, loss, or, resource, scarcities, 152, the, concept, of, sustainability, transitions, is, like, the, concept, of, energy, transitions, one, expert, argues, a, sustainability, transition, must, be, supported, by, a, new, kind, of, culture, a, new, kind, of, collaboration, a, new, kind, of, leadership, it, requires, a, large, investment, in, new, and, greener, capital, goods, while, simultaneously, shifting, capital, away, from, unsustainable, systems, 107, it, prefers, these, to, unsustainable, options, 101, in, 2024, an, interdisciplinary, group, of, experts, including, chip, fletcher, william, j, ripple, phoebe, barnard, kamanamaikalani, beamer, christopher, field, david, karl, david, king, michael, e, mann, and, naomi, oreskes, published, the, academic, paper, earth, at, risk, they, made, an, extensive, review, of, existing, scientific, literature, placing, the, blame, for, the, ecological, crisis, on, imperialism, extractive, capitalism, and, a, surging, population, and, proposed, a, paradigm, shift, that, replaces, it, with, a, socio, economic, model, prioritizing, sustainability, resilience, justice, kinship, with, nature, and, communal, well, being, they, described, many, ways, in, which, the, transition, to, a, sustainable, future, can, be, achieved, a, sustainability, transition, requires, major, change, in, societies, they, must, change, their, fundamental, values, and, organizing, principles, 15, these, new, values, would, emphasize, the, quality, of, life, and, material, sufficiency, human, solidarity, and, global, equity, and, affinity, with, nature, and, environmental, sustainability, 15, a, transition, may, only, work, if, far, reaching, lifestyle, changes, accompany, technological, advances, scientists, have, pointed, out, that, sustainability, transitions, come, about, in, diverse, ways, and, all, require, civil, society, pressure, and, evidence, based, advocacy, political, leadership, and, a, solid, understanding, of, policy, instruments, markets, and, other, drivers, there, are, four, possible, overlapping, processes, of, transformation, they, each, have, different, political, dynamics, technology, markets, government, or, citizens, can, lead, these, processes, it, is, possible, to, divide, action, principles, to, make, societies, more, sustainable, into, four, types, these, are, nature, related, personal, society, related, and, systems, related, principles, 206, there, are, many, approaches, that, people, can, take, to, transition, to, environmental, sustainability, these, include, maintaining, ecosystem, services, protecting, and, co, creating, common, resources, reducing, food, waste, and, promoting, dietary, shifts, towards, plant, based, foods, another, is, reducing, population, growth, by, cutting, fertility, rates, others, are, promoting, new, green, technologies, and, adopting, renewable, energy, sources, while, phasing, out, subsidies, to, fossil, fuels, in, 2017, scientists, published, an, update, to, the, 1992, world, scientists, warning, to, humanity, it, showed, how, to, move, towards, environmental, sustainability, it, proposed, steps, in, three, areas, in, 2015, the, united, nations, agreed, the, sustainable, development, goals, sdgs, their, official, name, is, agenda, 2030, for, the, sustainable, development, goals, the, un, described, this, programme, as, a, very, ambitious, and, transformational, vision, it, said, the, sdgs, were, of, unprecedented, scope, and, significance, 3, 35, the, un, said, we, are, determined, to, take, the, bold, and, transformative, steps, which, are, urgently, needed, to, shift, the, world, on, to, a, sustainable, and, resilient, path, the, 17, goals, and, targets, lay, out, transformative, steps, for, example, the, sdgs, aim, to, protect, the, future, of, planet, earth, the, un, pledged, to, protect, the, planet, from, degradation, including, through, sustainable, consumption, and, production, sustainably, managing, its, natural, resources, and, taking, urgent, action, on, climate, change, so, that, it, can, support, the, needs, of, the, present, and, future, generations, eco, economic, decoupling, is, an, idea, to, resolve, tradeoffs, between, economic, growth, and, environmental, conservation, the, idea, is, to, decouple, environmental, bads, from, economic, goods, as, a, path, towards, sustainability, this, would, mean, using, less, resources, per, unit, of, economic, output, and, reducing, the, environmental, impact, of, any, resources, that, are, used, or, economic, activities, that, are, undertaken, 8, the, intensity, of, pollutants, emitted, makes, it, possible, to, measure, pressure, on, the, environment, this, in, turn, makes, it, possible, to, measure, decoupling, this, involves, following, changes, in, the, emission, intensity, associated, with, economic, output, examples, of, absolute, long, term, decoupling, are, rare, but, some, industrialized, countries, have, decoupled, gdp, growth, from, production, and, consumption, based, co, 2, emissions, yet, even, in, this, example, decoupling, alone, is, not, enough, it, is, necessary, to, accompany, it, with, sufficiency, oriented, strategies, and, strict, enforcement, of, absolute, reduction, targets, 1, one, study, in, 2020, found, no, evidence, of, necessary, decoupling, this, was, a, meta, analysis, of, 180, scientific, studies, it, found, that, there, is, no, evidence, of, the, kind, of, decoupling, needed, for, ecological, sustainability, and, that, in, the, absence, of, robust, evidence, the, goal, of, decoupling, rests, partly, on, faith, some, experts, have, questioned, the, possibilities, for, decoupling, and, thus, the, feasibility, of, green, growth, some, have, argued, that, decoupling, on, its, own, will, not, be, enough, to, reduce, environmental, pressures, they, say, it, would, need, to, include, the, issue, of, economic, growth, there, are, several, reasons, why, adequate, decoupling, is, currently, not, taking, place, these, are, rising, energy, expenditure, rebound, effects, problem, shifting, the, underestimated, impact, of, services, the, limited, potential, of, recycling, insufficient, and, inappropriate, technological, change, and, cost, shifting, the, decoupling, of, economic, growth, from, environmental, deterioration, is, difficult, this, is, because, the, entity, that, causes, environmental, and, social, costs, does, not, generally, pay, for, them, so, the, market, price, does, not, express, such, costs, for, example, the, cost, of, packaging, into, the, price, of, a, product, may, factor, in, the, cost, of, packaging, but, it, may, omit, the, cost, of, disposing, of, that, packaging, economics, describes, such, factors, as, externalities, in, this, case, a, negative, externality, usually, it, is, up, to, government, action, or, local, governance, to, deal, with, externalities, an, important, challenge, for, effective, sustainability, transitions, is, uncertainty, and, risk, avoidance, by, businesses, who, want, to, continue, their, economic, growth, while, also, reducing, their, environmental, impact, business, model, innovation, bmi, helps, companies, manage, the, uncertainty, of, such, transitions, by, balancing, operational, efficiency, with, innovation, and, collaboration, a, case, study, of, stora, enso, demonstrates, how, a, mix, of, business, models, and, partnerships, can, drive, sustainable, change, and, reduce, uncertainties, in, complex, business, environments, there, are, various, ways, to, incorporate, environmental, and, social, costs, and, benefits, into, economic, activities, examples, include, taxing, the, activity, the, polluter, pays, subsidizing, activities, with, positive, effects, rewarding, stewardship, and, outlawing, particular, levels, of, damaging, practices, legal, limits, on, pollution, a, textbook, on, natural, resources, and, environmental, economics, stated, in, 2011, nobody, who, has, seriously, studied, the, issues, believes, that, the, economy, s, relationship, to, the, natural, environment, can, be, left, entirely, to, market, forces, 15, this, means, natural, resources, will, be, over, exploited, and, destroyed, in, the, long, run, without, government, action, elinor, ostrom, winner, of, the, 2009, nobel, economics, prize, expanded, on, this, she, stated, that, local, governance, or, self, governance, can, be, a, third, option, besides, the, market, or, the, national, government, she, studied, how, people, in, small, local, communities, manage, shared, natural, resources, she, showed, that, communities, using, natural, resources, can, establish, rules, their, for, use, and, maintenance, these, are, resources, such, as, pastures, fishing, waters, and, forests, this, leads, to, both, economic, and, ecological, sustainability, successful, self, governance, needs, groups, with, frequent, communication, among, participants, in, this, case, groups, can, manage, the, usage, of, common, goods, without, overexploitation, 117, based, on, ostrom, s, work, some, have, argued, that, common, pool, resources, today, are, overcultivated, because, the, different, agents, do, not, know, each, other, and, cannot, directly, communicate, with, one, another, 117, questions, of, global, concern, are, difficult, to, tackle, that, is, because, global, issues, need, global, solutions, but, existing, global, organizations, un, wto, and, others, do, not, have, sufficient, means, 135, for, example, they, lack, sanctioning, mechanisms, to, enforce, existing, global, regulations, 136, some, institutions, do, not, enjoy, universal, acceptance, an, example, is, the, international, criminal, court, their, agendas, are, not, aligned, for, example, unep, undp, and, wto, and, some, accuse, them, of, nepotism, and, mismanagement, 135, 145, multilateral, international, agreements, treaties, and, intergovernmental, organizations, igos, face, further, challenges, these, result, in, barriers, to, sustainability, often, these, arrangements, rely, on, voluntary, commitments, an, example, is, nationally, determined, contributions, for, climate, action, there, can, be, a, lack, of, enforcement, of, existing, national, or, international, regulation, and, there, can, be, gaps, in, regulation, for, international, actors, such, as, multi, national, enterprises, critics, of, some, global, organizations, say, they, lack, legitimacy, and, democracy, institutions, facing, such, criticism, include, the, wto, imf, world, bank, unfccc, g7, g8, and, oecd, 135, sustainable, business, practices, integrate, ecological, concerns, with, social, and, economic, ones, one, accounting, framework, for, this, approach, uses, the, phrase, people, planet, and, profit, the, name, of, this, approach, is, the, triple, bottom, line, the, circular, economy, is, a, related, concept, its, goal, is, to, decouple, environmental, pressure, from, economic, growth, growing, attention, towards, sustainability, has, led, to, the, formation, of, many, organizations, these, include, the, sustainability, consortium, of, the, society, for, organizational, learning, the, sustainable, business, institute, and, the, world, business, council, for, sustainable, development, supply, chain, sustainability, looks, at, the, environmental, and, human, impacts, of, products, in, the, supply, chain, it, considers, how, they, move, from, raw, materials, sourcing, to, production, storage, and, delivery, and, every, transportation, link, on, the, way, religious, leaders, have, stressed, the, importance, of, caring, for, nature, and, environmental, sustainability, in, 2015, over, 150, leaders, from, various, faiths, issued, a, joint, statement, to, the, un, climate, summit, in, paris, 2015, they, reiterated, a, statement, made, in, the, interfaith, summit, in, new, york, in, 2014, as, representatives, from, different, faith, and, religious, traditions, we, stand, together, to, express, deep, concern, for, the, consequences, of, climate, change, on, the, earth, and, its, people, all, entrusted, as, our, faiths, reveal, to, our, common, care, climate, change, is, indeed, a, threat, to, life, a, precious, gift, we, have, received, and, that, we, need, to, care, for, individuals, can, also, live, in, a, more, sustainable, way, they, can, change, their, lifestyles, practise, ethical, consumerism, and, embrace, frugality, 236, these, sustainable, living, approaches, can, also, make, cities, more, sustainable, they, do, this, by, altering, the, built, environment, such, approaches, include, sustainable, transport, sustainable, architecture, and, zero, emission, housing, research, can, identify, the, main, issues, to, focus, on, these, include, flying, meat, and, dairy, products, car, driving, and, household, sufficiency, research, can, show, how, to, create, cultures, of, sufficiency, care, solidarity, and, simplicity, some, young, people, are, using, activism, litigation, and, on, the, ground, efforts, to, advance, sustainability, this, is, particularly, the, case, in, the, area, of, climate, action, 60, scholars, have, criticized, the, concepts, of, sustainability, and, sustainable, development, from, different, angles, one, was, dennis, meadows, one, of, the, authors, of, the, first, report, to, the, club, of, rome, called, the, limits, to, growth, he, argued, many, people, deceive, themselves, by, using, the, brundtland, definition, of, sustainability, this, is, because, the, needs, of, the, present, generation, are, actually, not, met, today, instead, economic, activities, to, meet, present, needs, will, shrink, the, options, of, future, generations, 27, another, criticism, is, that, the, paradigm, of, sustainability, is, no, longer, suitable, as, a, guide, for, transformation, this, is, because, societies, are, socially, and, ecologically, self, destructive, consumer, societies, some, scholars, have, even, proclaimed, the, end, of, the, concept, of, sustainability, this, is, because, humans, now, have, a, significant, impact, on, earth, s, climate, system, and, ecosystems, it, might, become, impossible, to, pursue, sustainability, because, of, these, complex, radical, and, dynamic, issues, others, have, called, sustainability, a, utopian, ideal, we, need, to, keep, sustainability, as, an, ideal, an, ideal, which, we, might, never, reach, which, might, be, utopian, but, still, a, necessary, one, 5, the, term, is, often, hijacked, and, thus, can, lose, its, meaning, people, use, it, for, all, sorts, of, things, such, as, saving, the, planet, to, recycling, your, rubbish, a, specific, definition, may, never, be, possible, this, is, because, sustainability, is, a, concept, that, provides, a, normative, structure, that, describes, what, human, society, regards, as, good, or, desirable, but, some, argue, that, while, sustainability, is, vague, and, contested, it, is, not, meaningless, although, lacking, in, a, singular, definition, this, concept, is, still, useful, scholars, have, argued, that, its, fuzziness, can, actually, be, liberating, this, is, because, it, means, that, the, basic, goal, of, sustainability, maintaining, or, improving, desirable, conditions, can, be, pursued, with, more, flexibility, sustainability, has, a, reputation, as, a, buzzword, people, may, use, the, terms, sustainability, and, sustainable, development, in, ways, that, are, different, to, how, they, are, usually, understood, this, can, result, in, confusion, and, mistrust, so, a, clear, explanation, of, how, the, terms, are, being, used, in, a, particular, situation, is, important, greenwashing, is, a, practice, of, deceptive, marketing, it, is, when, a, company, or, organization, provides, misleading, information, about, the, sustainability, of, a, product, policy, or, other, activity, 26, investors, are, wary, of, this, issue, as, it, exposes, them, to, risk, the, reliability, of, eco, labels, is, also, doubtful, in, some, cases, ecolabelling, is, a, voluntary, method, of, environmental, performance, certification, and, labelling, for, food, and, consumer, products, the, most, credible, eco, labels, are, those, developed, with, close, participation, from, all, relevant, stakeholders
