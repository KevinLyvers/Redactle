mackerel, is, a, common, name, applied, to, a, number, of, different, species, of, pelagic, fish, mostly, from, the, family, scombridae, they, are, found, in, both, temperate, and, tropical, seas, mostly, living, along, the, coast, or, offshore, in, the, oceanic, environment, mackerel, species, typically, have, deeply, forked, tails, and, vertical, tiger, like, stripes, on, their, backs, with, an, iridescent, green, blue, quality, many, are, restricted, in, their, distribution, ranges, and, live, in, separate, populations, or, fish, stocks, based, on, geography, some, stocks, migrate, in, large, schools, along, the, coast, to, suitable, spawning, grounds, where, they, spawn, in, fairly, shallow, waters, after, spawning, they, return, the, way, they, came, in, smaller, schools, to, suitable, feeding, grounds, often, near, an, area, of, upwelling, from, there, they, may, move, offshore, into, deeper, waters, and, spend, the, winter, in, relative, inactivity, other, stocks, migrate, across, oceans, smaller, mackerel, are, forage, fish, for, larger, predators, including, larger, mackerel, and, atlantic, cod, flocks, of, seabirds, whales, dolphins, sharks, and, schools, of, larger, fish, such, as, tuna, and, marlin, follow, mackerel, schools, and, attack, them, in, sophisticated, and, cooperative, ways, mackerel, flesh, is, high, in, omega, 3, oils, and, is, intensively, harvested, by, humans, in, 2009, over, 5, million, tons, were, landed, by, commercial, fishermen, sport, fishermen, value, the, fighting, abilities, of, the, king, mackerel, over, 30, different, species, principally, belonging, to, the, family, scombridae, are, commonly, referred, to, as, mackerel, the, term, mackerel, is, derived, from, old, french, and, may, have, originally, meant, either, marked, spotted, or, pimp, procurer, the, latter, connection, is, not, altogether, clear, but, mackerel, spawn, enthusiastically, in, shoals, near, the, coast, and, medieval, ideas, on, animal, procreation, were, creative, about, 21, species, in, the, family, scombridae, are, commonly, called, mackerel, the, type, species, for, the, scombroid, mackerel, is, the, atlantic, mackerel, scomber, scombrus, until, recently, atlantic, chub, mackerel, and, indo, pacific, chub, mackerel, were, thought, to, be, subspecies, of, the, same, species, in, 1999, collette, established, on, molecular, and, morphological, considerations, that, these, are, separate, species, mackerel, are, smaller, with, shorter, lifecycles, than, their, close, relatives, the, tuna, which, are, also, members, of, the, same, family, the, true, mackerels, belong, to, the, tribe, scombrini, the, tribe, consists, of, seven, species, each, belonging, to, one, of, two, genera, scomber, or, rastrelliger, the, spanish, mackerels, belong, to, the, tribe, scomberomorini, which, is, the, cousin, tribe, of, the, true, mackerels, this, tribe, consists, of, 21, species, in, all, 18, of, those, are, classified, into, the, genus, scomberomorus, two, into, grammatorcynus, and, a, single, species, into, the, monotypic, genus, acanthocybium, in, addition, a, number, of, species, with, mackerel, like, characteristics, in, the, families, carangidae, hexagrammidae, and, gempylidae, are, commonly, referred, to, as, mackerel, some, confusion, had, occurred, between, the, pacific, jack, mackerel, trachurus, symmetricus, and, the, heavily, harvested, chilean, jack, mackerel, t, murphyi, these, have, been, thought, at, times, to, be, the, same, species, but, are, now, recognised, as, separate, species, the, term, mackerel, is, also, used, as, a, modifier, in, the, common, names, of, other, fish, sometimes, indicating, the, fish, has, vertical, stripes, similar, to, a, scombroid, mackerel, by, extension, the, term, is, applied, also, to, other, species, such, as, the, mackerel, tabby, cat, and, to, inanimate, objects, such, as, the, altocumulus, mackerel, sky, cloud, formation, most, mackerel, belong, to, the, family, scombridae, which, also, includes, tuna, and, bonito, generally, mackerel, are, much, smaller, and, slimmer, than, tuna, though, in, other, respects, they, share, many, common, characteristics, their, scales, if, present, at, all, are, extremely, small, like, tuna, and, bonito, mackerel, are, voracious, feeders, and, are, swift, and, manoeuvrable, swimmers, able, to, streamline, themselves, by, retracting, their, fins, into, grooves, on, their, bodies, like, other, scombroids, their, bodies, are, cylindrical, with, numerous, finlets, on, the, dorsal, and, ventral, sides, behind, the, dorsal, and, anal, fins, but, unlike, the, deep, bodied, tuna, they, are, slim, the, type, species, for, scombroid, mackerels, is, the, atlantic, mackerel, scomber, scombrus, these, fish, are, iridescent, blue, green, above, with, a, silvery, underbelly, and, near, vertical, wavy, black, stripes, running, along, their, upper, bodies, the, prominent, stripes, on, the, back, of, mackerels, seemingly, are, there, to, provide, camouflage, against, broken, backgrounds, that, is, not, the, case, though, because, mackerel, live, in, midwater, pelagic, environments, which, have, no, background, however, fish, have, an, optokinetic, reflex, in, their, visual, systems, that, can, be, sensitive, to, moving, stripes, for, fish, to, school, efficiently, they, need, feedback, mechanisms, that, help, them, align, themselves, with, adjacent, fish, and, match, their, speed, the, stripes, on, neighbouring, fish, provide, schooling, marks, which, signal, changes, in, relative, position, a, layer, of, thin, reflecting, platelets, is, seen, on, some, of, the, mackerel, stripes, in, 1998, e, j, denton, and, d, m, rowe, argued, that, these, platelets, transmit, additional, information, to, other, fish, about, how, a, given, fish, moves, as, the, orientation, of, the, fish, changes, relative, to, another, fish, the, amount, of, light, reflected, to, the, second, fish, by, this, layer, also, changes, this, sensitivity, to, orientation, gives, the, mackerel, considerable, advantages, in, being, able, to, react, quickly, while, schooling, and, feeding, mackerel, range, in, size, from, small, forage, fish, to, larger, game, fish, coastal, mackerel, tend, to, be, small, the, king, mackerel, is, an, example, of, a, larger, mackerel, most, fish, are, cold, blooded, but, exceptions, exist, certain, species, of, fish, maintain, elevated, body, temperatures, endothermic, bony, fishes, are, all, in, the, suborder, scombroidei, and, include, the, butterfly, mackerel, a, species, of, primitive, mackerel, mackerel, are, strong, swimmers, known, in, the, latin, family, as, punctualis, piscis, which, translates, to, punctual, fish, this, is, due, to, its, punctuality, of, migration, during, mating, season, as, it, moves, from, warm, to, cold, waters, atlantic, mackerel, can, swim, at, a, sustained, speed, of, 0, 98, m, sec, with, a, burst, speed, of, 5, 5, m, sec, while, chub, mackerel, can, swim, at, a, sustained, speed, of, 0, 92, m, sec, with, a, burst, speed, of, 2, 25, m, sec, most, mackerel, species, have, restricted, distribution, ranges, some, mackerel, species, migrate, vertically, adult, snake, mackerel, conduct, a, diel, vertical, migration, staying, in, deeper, water, during, the, day, and, rising, to, the, surface, at, night, to, feed, the, young, and, juveniles, also, migrate, vertically, but, in, the, opposite, direction, staying, near, the, surface, during, the, day, and, moving, deeper, at, night, mackerel, are, prolific, broadcast, spawners, and, must, breed, near, the, surface, of, the, water, because, the, eggs, of, the, females, float, individual, females, lay, between, 300, 000, and, 1, 500, 000, eggs, their, eggs, and, larvae, are, pelagic, that, is, they, float, free, in, the, open, sea, the, larvae, and, juvenile, mackerel, feed, on, zooplankton, as, adults, they, have, sharp, teeth, and, hunt, small, crustaceans, such, as, copepods, forage, fish, shrimp, and, squid, in, turn, they, are, hunted, by, larger, pelagic, animals, such, as, tuna, billfish, sea, lions, sharks, and, pelicans, off, madagascar, spinner, sharks, follow, migrating, schools, of, mackerel, bryde, s, whales, feed, on, mackerel, when, they, can, find, them, they, use, several, feeding, methods, including, skimming, the, surface, lunging, and, bubble, nets, chub, mackerel, scomber, japonicus, are, the, most, intensively, fished, scombroid, mackerel, they, account, for, about, half, the, total, capture, production, of, scombroid, mackerels, as, a, species, they, are, easily, confused, with, atlantic, mackerel, chub, mackerel, migrate, long, distances, in, oceans, and, across, the, mediterranean, they, can, be, caught, with, drift, nets, and, suitable, trawls, but, are, most, usually, caught, with, surround, nets, at, night, by, attracting, them, with, lampara, lamps, the, remaining, catch, of, scombroid, mackerels, is, divided, equally, between, the, atlantic, mackerel, and, all, other, scombroid, mackerels, just, these, two, species, chub, mackerel, and, atlantic, mackerel, account, for, about, 75, of, the, total, catch, of, scombroid, mackerels, chilean, jack, mackerel, are, the, most, commonly, fished, nonscombroid, mackerel, fished, as, heavily, as, chub, mackerel, the, species, has, been, overfished, and, its, fishery, may, now, be, in, danger, of, collapsing, smaller, mackerel, behave, like, herrings, and, are, captured, in, similar, ways, fish, species, like, these, which, school, near, the, surface, can, be, caught, efficiently, by, purse, seining, huge, purse, seine, vessels, use, spotter, planes, to, locate, the, schooling, fish, then, they, close, in, using, sophisticated, sonar, to, track, the, shape, of, the, school, which, is, then, encircled, with, fast, auxiliary, boats, that, deploy, purse, seines, as, they, speed, around, the, school, suitably, designed, trollers, can, also, catch, mackerels, effectively, when, they, swim, near, the, surface, trollers, typically, have, several, long, booms, which, they, lift, and, drop, with, topping, lifts, they, haul, their, lines, with, electric, or, hydraulic, reels, fish, aggregating, devices, are, also, used, to, target, mackerel, the, north, sea, has, been, overfished, to, the, point, where, the, ecological, balance, has, become, disrupted, and, many, jobs, in, the, fishing, industry, have, been, lost, the, southeast, us, region, spans, the, gulf, of, mexico, the, caribbean, sea, and, the, us, southeast, atlantic, overfishing, of, king, and, spanish, mackerel, occurred, in, the, 1980s, regulations, were, introduced, to, restrict, the, size, fishing, locations, and, bag, limits, for, recreational, fishers, and, commercial, fishers, gillnets, were, banned, in, waters, off, florida, by, 2001, the, mackerel, stocks, had, bounced, back, mackerel, is, an, important, food, fish, that, is, consumed, worldwide, as, an, oily, fish, it, is, a, rich, source, of, omega, 3, fatty, acids, the, flesh, of, mackerel, spoils, quickly, especially, in, the, tropics, and, can, cause, scombroid, food, poisoning, accordingly, it, should, be, eaten, on, the, day, of, capture, unless, properly, refrigerated, or, cured, mackerel, preservation, is, not, simple, before, the, 19th, century, development, of, canning, and, the, widespread, availability, of, refrigeration, salting, and, smoking, were, the, principal, preservation, methods, available, historically, in, england, this, fish, was, not, preserved, but, was, consumed, only, in, its, fresh, form, however, spoilage, was, common, leading, the, authors, of, the, cambridge, economic, history, of, europe, to, remark, there, are, more, references, to, stinking, mackerel, in, english, literature, than, to, any, other, fish, in, france, mackerel, was, traditionally, pickled, with, large, amounts, of, salt, which, allowed, it, to, be, sold, widely, across, the, country, for, many, years, mackerel, was, regarded, as, unclean, in, the, uk, and, other, places, due, to, folklore, which, suggested, that, the, fish, fed, on, the, corpses, of, dead, sailors, a, 1976, survey, of, housewives, in, britain, undertaken, by, the, white, fish, authority, indicated, a, reluctance, to, departing, from, buying, the, traditional, staples, of, cod, haddock, or, salmon, less, than, 10, of, the, survey, s, 1, 931, respondents, had, ever, bought, mackerel, and, only, 3, did, so, regularly, as, a, result, of, this, trend, many, uk, fishmongers, during, the, 1970s, did, not, display, or, even, stock, mackerel
