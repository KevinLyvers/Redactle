ribonucleic, acid, rna, is, a, polymeric, molecule, that, is, essential, for, most, biological, functions, either, by, performing, the, function, itself, non, coding, rna, or, by, forming, a, template, for, the, production, of, proteins, messenger, rna, rna, and, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, are, nucleic, acids, the, nucleic, acids, constitute, one, of, the, four, major, macromolecules, essential, for, all, known, forms, of, life, rna, is, assembled, as, a, chain, of, nucleotides, cellular, organisms, use, messenger, rna, mrna, to, convey, genetic, information, using, the, nitrogenous, bases, of, guanine, uracil, adenine, and, cytosine, denoted, by, the, letters, g, u, a, and, c, that, directs, synthesis, of, specific, proteins, many, viruses, encode, their, genetic, information, using, an, rna, genome, some, rna, molecules, play, an, active, role, within, cells, by, catalyzing, biological, reactions, controlling, gene, expression, or, sensing, and, communicating, responses, to, cellular, signals, one, of, these, active, processes, is, protein, synthesis, a, universal, function, in, which, rna, molecules, direct, the, synthesis, of, proteins, on, ribosomes, this, process, uses, transfer, rna, trna, molecules, to, deliver, amino, acids, to, the, ribosome, where, ribosomal, rna, rrna, then, links, amino, acids, together, to, form, coded, proteins, it, has, become, widely, accepted, in, science, that, early, in, the, history, of, life, on, earth, prior, to, the, evolution, of, dna, and, possibly, of, protein, based, enzymes, as, well, an, rna, world, existed, in, which, rna, served, as, both, living, organisms, storage, method, for, genetic, information, a, role, fulfilled, today, by, dna, except, in, the, case, of, rna, viruses, and, potentially, performed, catalytic, functions, in, cells, a, function, performed, today, by, protein, enzymes, with, the, notable, and, important, exception, of, the, ribosome, which, is, a, ribozyme, the, chemical, structure, of, rna, is, very, similar, to, that, of, dna, but, differs, in, three, primary, ways, like, dna, most, biologically, active, rnas, including, mrna, trna, rrna, snrnas, and, other, non, coding, rnas, contain, self, complementary, sequences, that, allow, parts, of, the, rna, to, fold, and, pair, with, itself, to, form, double, helices, analysis, of, these, rnas, has, revealed, that, they, are, highly, structured, unlike, dna, their, structures, do, not, consist, of, long, double, helices, but, rather, collections, of, short, helices, packed, together, into, structures, akin, to, proteins, in, this, fashion, rnas, can, achieve, chemical, catalysis, like, enzymes, for, instance, determination, of, the, structure, of, the, ribosome, an, rna, protein, complex, that, catalyzes, the, assembly, of, proteins, revealed, that, its, active, site, is, composed, entirely, of, rna, each, nucleotide, in, rna, contains, a, ribose, sugar, with, carbons, numbered, 1, through, 5, a, base, is, attached, to, the, 1, position, in, general, adenine, a, cytosine, c, guanine, g, or, uracil, u, adenine, and, guanine, are, purines, and, cytosine, and, uracil, are, pyrimidines, a, phosphate, group, is, attached, to, the, 3, position, of, one, ribose, and, the, 5, position, of, the, next, the, phosphate, groups, have, a, negative, charge, each, making, rna, a, charged, molecule, polyanion, the, bases, form, hydrogen, bonds, between, cytosine, and, guanine, between, adenine, and, uracil, and, between, guanine, and, uracil, however, other, interactions, are, possible, such, as, a, group, of, adenine, bases, binding, to, each, other, in, a, bulge, or, the, gnra, tetraloop, that, has, a, guanine, adenine, base, pair, an, important, structural, component, of, rna, that, distinguishes, it, from, dna, is, the, presence, of, a, hydroxyl, group, at, the, 2, position, of, the, ribose, sugar, the, presence, of, this, functional, group, causes, the, helix, to, mostly, take, the, a, form, geometry, although, in, single, strand, dinucleotide, contexts, rna, can, rarely, also, adopt, the, b, form, most, commonly, observed, in, dna, the, a, form, geometry, results, in, a, very, deep, and, narrow, major, groove, and, a, shallow, and, wide, minor, groove, a, second, consequence, of, the, presence, of, the, 2, hydroxyl, group, is, that, in, conformationally, flexible, regions, of, an, rna, molecule, that, is, not, involved, in, formation, of, a, double, helix, it, can, chemically, attack, the, adjacent, phosphodiester, bond, to, cleave, the, backbone, rna, is, transcribed, with, only, four, bases, adenine, cytosine, guanine, and, uracil, but, these, bases, and, attached, sugars, can, be, modified, in, numerous, ways, as, the, rnas, mature, pseudouridine, in, which, the, linkage, between, uracil, and, ribose, is, changed, from, a, c, n, bond, to, a, c, c, bond, and, ribothymidine, t, are, found, in, various, places, the, most, notable, ones, being, in, the, t, c, loop, of, trna, another, notable, modified, base, is, hypoxanthine, a, deaminated, adenine, base, whose, nucleoside, is, called, inosine, i, inosine, plays, a, key, role, in, the, wobble, hypothesis, of, the, genetic, code, there, are, more, than, 100, other, naturally, occurring, modified, nucleosides, the, greatest, structural, diversity, of, modifications, can, be, found, in, trna, while, pseudouridine, and, nucleosides, with, 2, o, methylribose, often, present, in, rrna, are, the, most, common, the, specific, roles, of, many, of, these, modifications, in, rna, are, not, fully, understood, however, it, is, notable, that, in, ribosomal, rna, many, of, the, post, transcriptional, modifications, occur, in, highly, functional, regions, such, as, the, peptidyl, transferase, center, and, the, subunit, interface, implying, that, they, are, important, for, normal, function, the, functional, form, of, single, stranded, rna, molecules, just, like, proteins, frequently, requires, a, specific, spatial, tertiary, structure, the, scaffold, for, this, structure, is, provided, by, secondary, structural, elements, that, are, hydrogen, bonds, within, the, molecule, this, leads, to, several, recognizable, domains, of, secondary, structure, like, hairpin, loops, bulges, and, internal, loops, in, order, to, create, i, e, design, rna, for, any, given, secondary, structure, two, or, three, bases, would, not, be, enough, but, four, bases, are, enough, this, is, likely, why, nature, has, chosen, a, four, base, alphabet, fewer, than, four, would, not, allow, the, creation, of, all, structures, while, more, than, four, bases, are, not, necessary, to, do, so, since, rna, is, charged, metal, ions, such, as, mg, 2, are, needed, to, stabilise, many, secondary, and, tertiary, structures, the, naturally, occurring, enantiomer, of, rna, is, d, rna, composed, of, d, ribonucleotides, all, chirality, centers, are, located, in, the, d, ribose, by, the, use, of, l, ribose, or, rather, l, ribonucleotides, l, rna, can, be, synthesized, l, rna, is, much, more, stable, against, degradation, by, rnase, like, other, structured, biopolymers, such, as, proteins, one, can, define, topology, of, a, folded, rna, molecule, this, is, often, done, based, on, arrangement, of, intra, chain, contacts, within, a, folded, rna, termed, as, circuit, topology, synthesis, of, rna, typically, occurs, in, the, cell, nucleus, and, is, usually, catalyzed, by, an, enzyme, rna, polymerase, using, dna, as, a, template, a, process, known, as, transcription, initiation, of, transcription, begins, with, the, binding, of, the, enzyme, to, a, promoter, sequence, in, the, dna, usually, found, upstream, of, a, gene, the, dna, double, helix, is, unwound, by, the, helicase, activity, of, the, enzyme, the, enzyme, then, progresses, along, the, template, strand, in, the, 3, to, 5, direction, synthesizing, a, complementary, rna, molecule, with, elongation, occurring, in, the, 5, to, 3, direction, the, dna, sequence, also, dictates, where, termination, of, rna, synthesis, will, occur, primary, transcript, rnas, are, often, modified, by, enzymes, after, transcription, for, example, a, poly, a, tail, and, a, 5, cap, are, added, to, eukaryotic, pre, mrna, and, introns, are, removed, by, the, spliceosome, there, are, also, a, number, of, rna, dependent, rna, polymerases, that, use, rna, as, their, template, for, synthesis, of, a, new, strand, of, rna, for, instance, a, number, of, rna, viruses, such, as, poliovirus, use, this, type, of, enzyme, to, replicate, their, genetic, material, also, rna, dependent, rna, polymerase, is, part, of, the, rna, interference, pathway, in, many, organisms, messenger, rna, mrna, is, the, type, of, rna, that, carries, information, from, dna, to, the, ribosome, the, sites, of, protein, synthesis, translation, in, the, cell, cytoplasm, the, coding, sequence, of, the, mrna, determines, the, amino, acid, sequence, in, the, protein, that, is, produced, however, many, rnas, do, not, code, for, protein, about, 97, of, the, transcriptional, output, is, non, protein, coding, in, eukaryotes, these, so, called, non, coding, rnas, ncrna, can, be, encoded, by, their, own, genes, rna, genes, but, can, also, derive, from, mrna, introns, the, most, prominent, examples, of, non, coding, rnas, are, transfer, rna, trna, and, ribosomal, rna, rrna, both, of, which, are, involved, in, the, process, of, translation, there, are, also, non, coding, rnas, involved, in, gene, regulation, rna, processing, and, other, roles, certain, rnas, are, able, to, catalyse, chemical, reactions, such, as, cutting, and, ligating, other, rna, molecules, and, the, catalysis, of, peptide, bond, formation, in, the, ribosome, these, are, known, as, ribozymes, according, to, the, length, of, rna, chain, rna, includes, small, rna, and, long, rna, usually, small, rnas, are, shorter, than, 200, nt, in, length, and, long, rnas, are, greater, than, 200, nt, long, long, rnas, also, called, large, rnas, mainly, include, long, non, coding, rna, lncrna, and, mrna, small, rnas, mainly, include, 5, 8s, ribosomal, rna, rrna, 5s, rrna, transfer, rna, trna, microrna, mirna, small, interfering, rna, sirna, small, nucleolar, rna, snornas, piwi, interacting, rna, pirna, trna, derived, small, rna, tsrna, and, small, rdna, derived, rna, srrna, there, are, certain, exceptions, as, in, the, case, of, the, 5s, rrna, of, the, members, of, the, genus, halococcus, archaea, which, have, an, insertion, thus, increasing, its, size, messenger, rna, mrna, carries, information, about, a, protein, sequence, to, the, ribosomes, the, protein, synthesis, factories, in, the, cell, it, is, coded, so, that, every, three, nucleotides, a, codon, corresponds, to, one, amino, acid, in, eukaryotic, cells, once, precursor, mrna, pre, mrna, has, been, transcribed, from, dna, it, is, processed, to, mature, mrna, this, removes, its, introns, non, coding, sections, of, the, pre, mrna, the, mrna, is, then, exported, from, the, nucleus, to, the, cytoplasm, where, it, is, bound, to, ribosomes, and, translated, into, its, corresponding, protein, form, with, the, help, of, trna, in, prokaryotic, cells, which, do, not, have, nucleus, and, cytoplasm, compartments, mrna, can, bind, to, ribosomes, while, it, is, being, transcribed, from, dna, after, a, certain, amount, of, time, the, message, degrades, into, its, component, nucleotides, with, the, assistance, of, ribonucleases, transfer, rna, trna, is, a, small, rna, chain, of, about, 80, nucleotides, that, transfers, a, specific, amino, acid, to, a, growing, polypeptide, chain, at, the, ribosomal, site, of, protein, synthesis, during, translation, it, has, sites, for, amino, acid, attachment, and, an, anticodon, region, for, codon, recognition, that, binds, to, a, specific, sequence, on, the, messenger, rna, chain, through, hydrogen, bonding, ribosomal, rna, rrna, is, the, catalytic, component, of, the, ribosomes, the, rrna, is, the, component, of, the, ribosome, that, hosts, translation, eukaryotic, ribosomes, contain, four, different, rrna, molecules, 18s, 5, 8s, 28s, and, 5s, rrna, three, of, the, rrna, molecules, are, synthesized, in, the, nucleolus, and, one, is, synthesized, elsewhere, in, the, cytoplasm, ribosomal, rna, and, protein, combine, to, form, a, nucleoprotein, called, a, ribosome, the, ribosome, binds, mrna, and, carries, out, protein, synthesis, several, ribosomes, may, be, attached, to, a, single, mrna, at, any, time, nearly, all, the, rna, found, in, a, typical, eukaryotic, cell, is, rrna, transfer, messenger, rna, tmrna, is, found, in, many, bacteria, and, plastids, it, tags, proteins, encoded, by, mrnas, that, lack, stop, codons, for, degradation, and, prevents, the, ribosome, from, stalling, the, earliest, known, regulators, of, gene, expression, were, proteins, known, as, repressors, and, activators, regulators, with, specific, short, binding, sites, within, enhancer, regions, near, the, genes, to, be, regulated, later, studies, have, shown, that, rnas, also, regulate, genes, there, are, several, kinds, of, rna, dependent, processes, in, eukaryotes, regulating, the, expression, of, genes, at, various, points, such, as, rnai, repressing, genes, post, transcriptionally, long, non, coding, rnas, shutting, down, blocks, of, chromatin, epigenetically, and, enhancer, rnas, inducing, increased, gene, expression, bacteria, and, archaea, have, also, been, shown, to, use, regulatory, rna, systems, such, as, bacterial, small, rnas, and, crispr, fire, and, mello, were, awarded, the, 2006, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, discovering, micrornas, mirnas, specific, short, rna, molecules, that, can, base, pair, with, mrnas, post, transcriptional, expression, levels, of, many, genes, can, be, controlled, by, rna, interference, in, which, mirnas, specific, short, rna, molecules, pair, with, mrna, regions, and, target, them, for, degradation, this, antisense, based, process, involves, steps, that, first, process, the, rna, so, that, it, can, base, pair, with, a, region, of, its, target, mrnas, once, the, base, pairing, occurs, other, proteins, direct, the, mrna, to, be, destroyed, by, nucleases, next, to, be, linked, to, regulation, were, xist, and, other, long, noncoding, rnas, associated, with, x, chromosome, inactivation, their, roles, at, first, mysterious, were, shown, by, jeannie, t, lee, and, others, to, be, the, silencing, of, blocks, of, chromatin, via, recruitment, of, polycomb, complex, so, that, messenger, rna, could, not, be, transcribed, from, them, additional, lncrnas, currently, defined, as, rnas, of, more, than, 200, base, pairs, that, do, not, appear, to, have, coding, potential, have, been, found, associated, with, regulation, of, stem, cell, pluripotency, and, cell, division, the, third, major, group, of, regulatory, rnas, is, called, enhancer, rnas, it, is, not, clear, at, present, whether, they, are, a, unique, category, of, rnas, of, various, lengths, or, constitute, a, distinct, subset, of, lncrnas, in, any, case, they, are, transcribed, from, enhancers, which, are, known, regulatory, sites, in, the, dna, near, genes, they, regulate, they, up, regulate, the, transcription, of, the, gene, s, under, control, of, the, enhancer, from, which, they, are, transcribed, at, first, regulatory, rna, was, thought, to, be, a, eukaryotic, phenomenon, a, part, of, the, explanation, for, why, so, much, more, transcription, in, higher, organisms, was, seen, than, had, been, predicted, but, as, soon, as, researchers, began, to, look, for, possible, rna, regulators, in, bacteria, they, turned, up, there, as, well, termed, as, small, rna, srna, currently, the, ubiquitous, nature, of, systems, of, rna, regulation, of, genes, has, been, discussed, as, support, for, the, rna, world, theory, there, are, indications, that, the, enterobacterial, srnas, are, involved, in, various, cellular, processes, and, seem, to, have, significant, role, in, stress, responses, such, as, membrane, stress, starvation, stress, phosphosugar, stress, and, dna, damage, also, it, has, been, suggested, that, srnas, have, been, evolved, to, have, important, role, in, stress, responses, because, of, their, kinetic, properties, that, allow, for, rapid, response, and, stabilisation, of, the, physiological, state, bacterial, small, rnas, generally, act, via, antisense, pairing, with, mrna, to, down, regulate, its, translation, either, by, affecting, stability, or, affecting, cis, binding, ability, riboswitches, have, also, been, discovered, they, are, cis, acting, regulatory, rna, sequences, acting, allosterically, they, change, shape, when, they, bind, metabolites, so, that, they, gain, or, lose, the, ability, to, bind, chromatin, to, regulate, expression, of, genes, archaea, also, have, systems, of, regulatory, rna, the, crispr, system, recently, being, used, to, edit, dna, in, situ, acts, via, regulatory, rnas, in, archaea, and, bacteria, to, provide, protection, against, virus, invaders, many, rnas, are, involved, in, modifying, other, rnas, introns, are, spliced, out, of, pre, mrna, by, spliceosomes, which, contain, several, small, nuclear, rnas, snrna, or, the, introns, can, be, ribozymes, that, are, spliced, by, themselves, rna, can, also, be, altered, by, having, its, nucleotides, modified, to, nucleotides, other, than, a, c, g, and, u, in, eukaryotes, modifications, of, rna, nucleotides, are, in, general, directed, by, small, nucleolar, rnas, snorna, 60, 300, nt, found, in, the, nucleolus, and, cajal, bodies, snornas, associate, with, enzymes, and, guide, them, to, a, spot, on, an, rna, by, basepairing, to, that, rna, these, enzymes, then, perform, the, nucleotide, modification, rrnas, and, trnas, are, extensively, modified, but, snrnas, and, mrnas, can, also, be, the, target, of, base, modification, rna, can, also, be, methylated, like, dna, rna, can, carry, genetic, information, rna, viruses, have, genomes, composed, of, rna, that, encodes, a, number, of, proteins, the, viral, genome, is, replicated, by, some, of, those, proteins, while, other, proteins, protect, the, genome, as, the, virus, particle, moves, to, a, new, host, cell, viroids, are, another, group, of, pathogens, but, they, consist, only, of, rna, do, not, encode, any, protein, and, are, replicated, by, a, host, plant, cell, s, polymerase, reverse, transcribing, viruses, replicate, their, genomes, by, reverse, transcribing, dna, copies, from, their, rna, these, dna, copies, are, then, transcribed, to, new, rna, retrotransposons, also, spread, by, copying, dna, and, rna, from, one, another, and, telomerase, contains, an, rna, that, is, used, as, template, for, building, the, ends, of, eukaryotic, chromosomes, double, stranded, rna, dsrna, is, rna, with, two, complementary, strands, similar, to, the, dna, found, in, all, cells, but, with, the, replacement, of, thymine, by, uracil, and, the, adding, of, one, oxygen, atom, dsrna, forms, the, genetic, material, of, some, viruses, double, stranded, rna, viruses, double, stranded, rna, such, as, viral, rna, or, sirna, can, trigger, rna, interference, in, eukaryotes, as, well, as, interferon, response, in, vertebrates, in, eukaryotes, double, stranded, rna, dsrna, plays, a, role, in, the, activation, of, the, innate, immune, system, against, viral, infections, in, the, late, 1970s, it, was, shown, that, there, is, a, single, stranded, covalently, closed, i, e, circular, form, of, rna, expressed, throughout, the, animal, and, plant, kingdom, see, circrna, circrnas, are, thought, to, arise, via, a, back, splice, reaction, where, the, spliceosome, joins, a, upstream, 3, acceptor, to, a, downstream, 5, donor, splice, site, so, far, the, function, of, circrnas, is, largely, unknown, although, for, few, examples, a, microrna, sponging, activity, has, been, demonstrated, research, on, rna, has, led, to, many, important, biological, discoveries, and, numerous, nobel, prizes, nucleic, acids, were, discovered, in, 1868, by, friedrich, miescher, who, called, the, material, nuclein, since, it, was, found, in, the, nucleus, it, was, later, discovered, that, prokaryotic, cells, which, do, not, have, a, nucleus, also, contain, nucleic, acids, the, role, of, rna, in, protein, synthesis, was, suspected, already, in, 1939, severo, ochoa, won, the, 1959, nobel, prize, in, medicine, shared, with, arthur, kornberg, after, he, discovered, an, enzyme, that, can, synthesize, rna, in, the, laboratory, however, the, enzyme, discovered, by, ochoa, polynucleotide, phosphorylase, was, later, shown, to, be, responsible, for, rna, degradation, not, rna, synthesis, in, 1956, alex, rich, and, david, davies, hybridized, two, separate, strands, of, rna, to, form, the, first, crystal, of, rna, whose, structure, could, be, determined, by, x, ray, crystallography, the, sequence, of, the, 77, nucleotides, of, a, yeast, trna, was, found, by, robert, w, holley, in, 1965, winning, holley, the, 1968, nobel, prize, in, medicine, shared, with, har, gobind, khorana, and, marshall, nirenberg, in, the, early, 1970s, retroviruses, and, reverse, transcriptase, were, discovered, showing, for, the, first, time, that, enzymes, could, copy, rna, into, dna, the, opposite, of, the, usual, route, for, transmission, of, genetic, information, for, this, work, david, baltimore, renato, dulbecco, and, howard, temin, were, awarded, a, nobel, prize, in, 1975, in, 1976, walter, fiers, and, his, team, determined, the, first, complete, nucleotide, sequence, of, an, rna, virus, genome, that, of, bacteriophage, ms2, in, 1977, introns, and, rna, splicing, were, discovered, in, both, mammalian, viruses, and, in, cellular, genes, resulting, in, a, 1993, nobel, to, philip, sharp, and, richard, roberts, catalytic, rna, molecules, ribozymes, were, discovered, in, the, early, 1980s, leading, to, a, 1989, nobel, award, to, thomas, cech, and, sidney, altman, in, 1990, it, was, found, in, petunia, that, introduced, genes, can, silence, similar, genes, of, the, plant, s, own, now, known, to, be, a, result, of, rna, interference, at, about, the, same, time, 22, nt, long, rnas, now, called, micrornas, were, found, to, have, a, role, in, the, development, of, c, elegans, studies, on, rna, interference, earned, a, nobel, prize, for, andrew, fire, and, craig, mello, in, 2006, and, another, nobel, for, studies, on, the, transcription, of, rna, to, roger, kornberg, in, the, same, year, the, discovery, of, gene, regulatory, rnas, has, led, to, attempts, to, develop, drugs, made, of, rna, such, as, sirna, to, silence, genes, adding, to, the, nobel, prizes, for, research, on, rna, in, 2009, it, was, awarded, for, the, elucidation, of, the, atomic, structure, of, the, ribosome, to, venki, ramakrishnan, thomas, a, steitz, and, ada, yonath, in, 2023, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, was, awarded, to, katalin, karik, and, drew, weissman, for, their, discoveries, concerning, modified, nucleosides, that, enabled, the, development, of, effective, mrna, vaccines, against, covid, 19, in, 1968, carl, woese, hypothesized, that, rna, might, be, catalytic, and, suggested, that, the, earliest, forms, of, life, self, replicating, molecules, could, have, relied, on, rna, both, to, carry, genetic, information, and, to, catalyze, biochemical, reactions, an, rna, world, in, may, 2022, scientists, discovered, that, rna, can, form, spontaneously, on, prebiotic, basalt, lava, glass, presumed, to, have, been, abundant, on, the, early, earth, in, march, 2015, dna, and, rna, nucleobases, including, uracil, cytosine, and, thymine, were, reportedly, formed, in, the, laboratory, under, outer, space, conditions, using, starter, chemicals, such, as, pyrimidine, an, organic, compound, commonly, found, in, meteorites, pyrimidine, like, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, pahs, is, one, of, the, most, carbon, rich, compounds, found, in, the, universe, and, may, have, been, formed, in, red, giants, or, in, interstellar, dust, and, gas, clouds, in, july, 2022, astronomers, reported, massive, amounts, of, prebiotic, molecules, including, possible, rna, precursors, in, the, galactic, center, of, the, milky, way, galaxy, rna, initially, deemed, unsuitable, for, therapeutics, due, to, its, short, half, life, has, been, made, useful, through, advances, in, stabilization, therapeutic, applications, arise, as, rna, folds, into, complex, conformations, and, binds, proteins, nucleic, acids, and, small, molecules, to, form, catalytic, centers, rna, based, vaccines, are, thought, to, be, easier, to, produce, than, traditional, vaccines, derived, from, killed, or, altered, pathogens, because, it, can,

therapeutic, properties, can, target, rna, and, dna, structures, thereby, treating, novel, diseases, however, research, is, scarce, on, small, molecules, targeting, rna, and, approved, drugs, for,
