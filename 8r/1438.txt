yellow, fever, is, a, viral, disease, of, typically, short, duration, in, most, cases, symptoms, include, fever, chills, loss, of, appetite, nausea, muscle, pains, particularly, in, the, back, and, headaches, symptoms, typically, improve, within, five, days, in, about, 15, of, people, within, a, day, of, improving, the, fever, comes, back, abdominal, pain, occurs, and, liver, damage, begins, causing, yellow, skin, if, this, occurs, the, risk, of, bleeding, and, kidney, problems, is, increased, the, disease, is, caused, by, the, yellow, fever, virus, and, is, spread, by, the, bite, of, an, infected, mosquito, it, infects, humans, other, primates, and, several, types, of, mosquitoes, in, cities, it, is, spread, primarily, by, aedes, aegypti, a, type, of, mosquito, found, throughout, the, tropics, and, subtropics, the, virus, is, an, rna, virus, of, the, genus, flavivirus, the, disease, may, be, difficult, to, tell, apart, from, other, illnesses, especially, in, the, early, stages, to, confirm, a, suspected, case, blood, sample, testing, with, a, polymerase, chain, reaction, is, required, a, safe, and, effective, vaccine, against, yellow, fever, exists, and, some, countries, require, vaccinations, for, travelers, other, efforts, to, prevent, infection, include, reducing, the, population, of, the, transmitting, mosquitoes, in, areas, where, yellow, fever, is, common, early, diagnosis, of, cases, and, immunization, of, large, parts, of, the, population, are, important, to, prevent, outbreaks, once, a, person, is, infected, management, is, symptomatic, no, specific, measures, are, effective, against, the, virus, death, occurs, in, up, to, half, of, those, who, get, severe, disease, in, 2013, yellow, fever, was, estimated, to, have, caused, 130, 000, severe, infections, and, 78, 000, deaths, in, africa, approximately, 90, percent, of, an, estimated, 200, 000, cases, of, yellow, fever, per, year, occur, in, africa, nearly, a, billion, people, live, in, an, area, of, the, world, where, the, disease, is, common, it, is, common, in, tropical, areas, of, the, continents, of, south, america, and, africa, but, not, in, asia, since, the, 1980s, the, number, of, cases, of, yellow, fever, has, been, increasing, this, is, believed, to, be, due, to, fewer, people, being, immune, more, people, living, in, cities, people, moving, frequently, and, changing, climate, increasing, the, habitat, for, mosquitoes, the, disease, originated, in, africa, and, spread, to, the, americas, starting, in, the, 17th, century, with, the, european, trafficking, of, enslaved, africans, from, sub, saharan, africa, since, the, 17th, century, several, major, outbreaks, of, the, disease, have, occurred, in, the, americas, africa, and, europe, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, yellow, fever, was, considered, one, of, the, most, dangerous, infectious, diseases, numerous, epidemics, swept, through, major, cities, of, the, us, and, in, other, parts, of, the, world, in, 1927, yellow, fever, virus, became, the, first, human, virus, to, be, isolated, yellow, fever, begins, after, an, incubation, period, of, three, to, six, days, most, cases, cause, only, mild, infection, with, fever, headache, chills, back, pain, fatigue, loss, of, appetite, muscle, pain, nausea, and, vomiting, in, these, cases, the, infection, lasts, only, three, to, six, days, but, in, 15, of, cases, people, enter, a, second, toxic, phase, of, the, disease, characterized, by, recurring, fever, this, time, accompanied, by, jaundice, due, to, liver, damage, as, well, as, abdominal, pain, bleeding, in, the, mouth, nose, eyes, and, the, gastrointestinal, tract, cause, vomit, containing, blood, hence, one, of, the, names, in, spanish, for, yellow, fever, v, mito, negro, black, vomit, there, may, also, be, kidney, failure, hiccups, and, delirium, among, those, who, develop, jaundice, the, fatality, rate, is, 20, to, 50, while, the, overall, fatality, rate, is, about, 3, to, 7, 5, severe, cases, may, have, a, mortality, rate, greater, than, 50, surviving, the, infection, provides, lifelong, immunity, and, normally, results, in, no, permanent, organ, damage, yellow, fever, can, lead, to, death, for, 20, to, 50, of, those, who, develop, severe, disease, jaundice, fatigue, heart, rhythm, problems, seizures, and, internal, bleeding, may, also, appear, as, complications, of, yellow, fever, during, recovery, time, yellow, fever, is, caused, by, yellow, fever, virus, yfv, an, enveloped, rna, virus, 40, 50, nm, in, width, the, type, species, and, namesake, of, the, family, flaviviridae, it, was, the, first, illness, shown, to, be, transmissible, by, filtered, human, serum, and, transmitted, by, mosquitoes, by, american, doctor, walter, reed, around, 1900, the, positive, sense, single, stranded, rna, is, around, 10, 862, nucleotides, long, and, has, a, single, open, reading, frame, encoding, a, polyprotein, host, proteases, cut, this, polyprotein, into, three, structural, c, prm, e, and, seven, nonstructural, proteins, ns1, ns2a, ns2b, ns3, ns4a, ns4b, ns5, the, enumeration, corresponds, to, the, arrangement, of, the, protein, coding, genes, in, the, genome, minimal, yfv, 3, utr, region, is, required, for, stalling, of, the, host, 5, 3, exonuclease, xrn1, the, utr, contains, pks3, pseudoknot, structure, which, serves, as, a, molecular, signal, to, stall, the, exonuclease, and, is, the, only, viral, requirement, for, subgenomic, flavivirus, rna, sfrna, production, the, sfrnas, are, a, result, of, incomplete, degradation, of, the, viral, genome, by, the, exonuclease, and, are, important, for, viral, pathogenicity, yellow, fever, belongs, to, the, group, of, hemorrhagic, fevers, the, viruses, infect, amongst, others, monocytes, macrophages, schwann, cells, and, dendritic, cells, they, attach, to, the, cell, surfaces, via, specific, receptors, and, are, taken, up, by, an, endosomal, vesicle, inside, the, endosome, the, decreased, ph, induces, the, fusion, of, the, endosomal, membrane, with, the, virus, envelope, the, capsid, enters, the, cytosol, decays, and, releases, the, genome, receptor, binding, as, well, as, membrane, fusion, are, catalyzed, by, the, protein, e, which, changes, its, conformation, at, low, ph, causing, a, rearrangement, of, the, 90, homo, dimers, to, 60, homo, trimers, after, entering, the, host, cell, the, viral, genome, is, replicated, in, the, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, er, and, in, the, so, called, vesicle, packets, at, first, an, immature, form, of, the, virus, particle, is, produced, inside, the, er, whose, m, protein, is, not, yet, cleaved, to, its, mature, form, so, is, denoted, as, precursor, m, prm, and, forms, a, complex, with, protein, e, the, immature, particles, are, processed, in, the, golgi, apparatus, by, the, host, protein, furin, which, cleaves, prm, to, m, this, releases, e, from, the, complex, which, can, now, take, its, place, in, the, mature, infectious, virion, yellow, fever, virus, is, mainly, transmitted, through, the, bite, of, the, yellow, fever, mosquito, aedes, aegypti, but, other, mostly, aedes, mosquitoes, such, as, the, tiger, mosquito, aedes, albopictus, can, also, serve, as, a, vector, for, this, virus, like, other, arboviruses, which, are, transmitted, by, mosquitoes, yellow, fever, virus, is, taken, up, by, a, female, mosquito, when, it, ingests, the, blood, of, an, infected, human, or, another, primate, viruses, reach, the, stomach, of, the, mosquito, and, if, the, virus, concentration, is, high, enough, the, virions, can, infect, epithelial, cells, and, replicate, there, from, there, they, reach, the, haemocoel, the, blood, system, of, mosquitoes, and, from, there, the, salivary, glands, when, the, mosquito, next, sucks, blood, it, injects, its, saliva, into, the, wound, and, the, virus, reaches, the, bloodstream, of, the, bitten, person, transovarial, transmissionial, and, transstadial, transmission, of, yellow, fever, virus, within, a, aegypti, that, is, the, transmission, from, a, female, mosquito, to, its, eggs, and, then, larvae, are, indicated, this, infection, of, vectors, without, a, previous, blood, meal, seems, to, play, a, role, in, single, sudden, breakouts, of, the, disease, three, epidemiologically, different, infectious, cycles, occur, in, which, the, virus, is, transmitted, from, mosquitoes, to, humans, or, other, primates, in, the, urban, cycle, only, the, yellow, fever, mosquito, a, aegypti, is, involved, it, is, well, adapted, to, urban, areas, and, can, also, transmit, other, diseases, including, zika, fever, dengue, fever, and, chikungunya, the, urban, cycle, is, responsible, for, the, major, outbreaks, of, yellow, fever, that, occur, in, africa, except, for, an, outbreak, in, bolivia, in, 1999, this, urban, cycle, no, longer, exists, in, south, america, besides, the, urban, cycle, both, in, africa, and, south, america, a, sylvatic, cycle, forest, or, jungle, cycle, is, present, where, aedes, africanus, in, africa, or, mosquitoes, of, the, genus, haemagogus, and, sabethes, in, south, america, serve, as, vectors, in, the, jungle, the, mosquitoes, infect, mainly, nonhuman, primates, the, disease, is, mostly, asymptomatic, in, african, primates, in, south, america, the, sylvatic, cycle, is, currently, the, only, way, unvaccinated, humans, can, become, infected, which, explains, the, low, incidence, of, yellow, fever, cases, on, the, continent, people, who, become, infected, in, the, jungle, can, carry, the, virus, to, urban, areas, where, a, aegypti, acts, as, a, vector, because, of, this, sylvatic, cycle, yellow, fever, cannot, be, eradicated, except, by, eradicating, the, mosquitoes, that, serve, as, vectors, in, africa, a, third, infectious, cycle, known, as, savannah, cycle, or, intermediate, cycle, occurs, between, the, jungle, and, urban, cycles, different, mosquitoes, of, the, genus, aedes, are, involved, in, recent, years, this, has, been, the, most, common, form, of, transmission, of, yellow, fever, in, africa, concern, exists, about, yellow, fever, spreading, to, southeast, asia, where, its, vector, a, aegypti, already, occurs, after, transmission, from, a, mosquito, the, viruses, replicate, in, the, lymph, nodes, and, infect, dendritic, cells, in, particular, from, there, they, reach, the, liver, and, infect, hepatocytes, probably, indirectly, via, kupffer, cells, which, leads, to, eosinophilic, degradation, of, these, cells, and, to, the, release, of, cytokines, apoptotic, masses, known, as, councilman, bodies, appear, in, the, cytoplasm, of, hepatocytes, fatality, may, occur, when, cytokine, storm, shock, and, multiple, organ, failure, follow, yellow, fever, is, most, frequently, a, clinical, diagnosis, based, on, symptomatology, and, travel, history, mild, cases, of, the, disease, can, only, be, confirmed, virologically, since, mild, cases, of, yellow, fever, can, also, contribute, significantly, to, regional, outbreaks, every, suspected, case, of, yellow, fever, involving, symptoms, of, fever, pain, nausea, and, vomiting, 6, 10, days, after, leaving, the, affected, area, is, treated, seriously, if, yellow, fever, is, suspected, the, virus, cannot, be, confirmed, until, 6, 10, days, following, the, illness, a, direct, confirmation, can, be, obtained, by, reverse, transcription, polymerase, chain, reaction, where, the, genome, of, the, virus, is, amplified, another, direct, approach, is, the, isolation, of, the, virus, and, its, growth, in, cell, culture, using, blood, plasma, this, can, take, 1, 4, weeks, serologically, an, enzyme, linked, immunosorbent, assay, during, the, acute, phase, of, the, disease, using, specific, igm, against, yellow, fever, or, an, increase, in, specific, igg, titer, compared, to, an, earlier, sample, can, confirm, yellow, fever, together, with, clinical, symptoms, the, detection, of, igm, or, a, four, fold, increase, in, igg, titer, is, considered, sufficient, indication, for, yellow, fever, as, these, tests, can, cross, react, with, other, flaviviruses, such, as, dengue, virus, these, indirect, methods, cannot, conclusively, prove, yellow, fever, infection, liver, biopsy, can, verify, inflammation, and, necrosis, of, hepatocytes, and, detect, viral, antigens, because, of, the, bleeding, tendency, of, yellow, fever, patients, a, biopsy, is, only, advisable, post, mortem, to, confirm, the, cause, of, death, in, a, differential, diagnosis, infections, with, yellow, fever, must, be, distinguished, from, other, feverish, illnesses, such, as, malaria, other, viral, hemorrhagic, fevers, such, as, ebola, virus, lassa, virus, marburg, virus, and, junin, virus, must, be, excluded, as, the, cause, personal, prevention, of, yellow, fever, includes, vaccination, and, avoidance, of, mosquito, bites, in, areas, where, yellow, fever, is, endemic, institutional, measures, for, prevention, of, yellow, fever, include, vaccination, programmes, and, measures, to, control, mosquitoes, programmes, for, distribution, of, mosquito, nets, for, use, in, homes, produce, reductions, in, cases, of, both, malaria, and, yellow, fever, use, of, epa, registered, insect, repellent, is, recommended, when, outdoors, exposure, for, even, a, short, time, is, enough, for, a, potential, mosquito, bite, long, sleeved, clothing, long, pants, and, socks, are, useful, for, prevention, the, application, of, larvicides, to, water, storage, containers, can, help, eliminate, potential, mosquito, breeding, sites, epa, registered, insecticide, spray, decreases, the, transmission, of, yellow, fever, vaccination, is, recommended, for, those, traveling, to, affected, areas, because, non, native, people, tend, to, develop, more, severe, illness, when, infected, protection, begins, by, the, 10th, day, after, vaccine, administration, in, 95, of, people, and, had, been, reported, to, last, for, at, least, 10, years, the, world, health, organization, who, now, states, that, a, single, dose, of, vaccine, is, sufficient, to, confer, lifelong, immunity, against, yellow, fever, disease, the, attenuated, live, vaccine, stem, 17d, was, developed, in, 1937, by, max, theiler, the, who, recommends, routine, vaccination, for, people, living, in, affected, areas, between, the, 9th, and, 12th, month, after, birth, up, to, one, in, four, people, experience, fever, aches, and, local, soreness, and, redness, at, the, site, of, injection, in, rare, cases, less, than, one, in, 200, 000, to, 300, 000, the, vaccination, can, cause, yellow, fever, vaccine, associated, viscerotropic, disease, which, is, fatal, in, 60, of, cases, it, is, probably, due, to, the, genetic, morphology, of, the, immune, system, another, possible, side, effect, is, an, infection, of, the, nervous, system, which, occurs, in, one, in, 200, 000, to, 300, 000, cases, causing, yellow, fever, vaccine, associated, neurotropic, disease, which, can, lead, to, meningoencephalitis, and, is, fatal, in, less, than, 5, of, cases, the, yellow, fever, initiative, launched, by, the, who, in, 2006, vaccinated, more, than, 105, million, people, in, 14, countries, in, west, africa, no, outbreaks, were, reported, during, 2015, the, campaign, was, supported, by, the, gavi, alliance, and, governmental, organizations, in, europe, and, africa, according, to, the, who, mass, vaccination, cannot, eliminate, yellow, fever, because, of, the, vast, number, of, infected, mosquitoes, in, urban, areas, of, the, target, countries, but, it, will, significantly, reduce, the, number, of, people, infected, demand, for, yellow, fever, vaccine, has, continued, to, increase, due, to, the, growing, number, of, countries, implementing, yellow, fever, vaccination, as, part, of, their, routine, immunization, programmes, recent, upsurges, in, yellow, fever, outbreaks, in, angola, 2015, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, 2016, uganda, 2016, and, more, recently, in, nigeria, and, brazil, in, 2017, have, further, increased, demand, while, straining, global, vaccine, supply, therefore, to, vaccinate, susceptible, populations, in, preventive, mass, immunization, campaigns, during, outbreaks, fractional, dosing, of, the, vaccine, is, being, considered, as, a, dose, sparing, strategy, to, maximize, limited, vaccine, supplies, fractional, dose, yellow, fever, vaccination, refers, to, administration, of, a, reduced, volume, of, vaccine, dose, which, has, been, reconstituted, as, per, manufacturer, recommendations, the, first, practical, use, of, fractional, dose, yellow, fever, vaccination, was, in, response, to, a, large, yellow, fever, outbreak, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, in, mid, 2016, available, evidence, shows, that, fractional, dose, yellow, fever, vaccination, induces, a, level, of, immune, response, similar, to, that, of, the, standard, full, dose, in, march, 2017, the, who, launched, a, vaccination, campaign, in, brazil, with, 3, 5, million, doses, from, an, emergency, stockpile, in, march, 2017, the, who, recommended, vaccination, for, travellers, to, certain, parts, of, brazil, in, march, 2018, brazil, shifted, its, policy, and, announced, it, planned, to, vaccinate, all, 77, 5, million, currently, unvaccinated, citizens, by, april, 2019, some, countries, in, asia, are, considered, to, be, potentially, in, danger, of, yellow, fever, epidemics, as, both, mosquitoes, with, the, capability, to, transmit, yellow, fever, as, well, as, susceptible, monkeys, are, present, the, disease, does, not, yet, occur, in, asia, to, prevent, introduction, of, the, virus, some, countries, demand, previous, vaccination, of, foreign, visitors, who, have, passed, through, yellow, fever, areas, vaccination, has, to, be, proved, by, a, vaccination, certificate, which, is, valid, 10, days, after, the, vaccination, and, lasts, for, 10, years, although, the, who, on, 17, may, 2013, advised, that, subsequent, booster, vaccinations, are, unnecessary, an, older, than, 10, years, certificate, may, not, be, acceptable, at, all, border, posts, in, all, affected, countries, a, list, of, the, countries, that, require, yellow, fever, vaccination, is, published, by, the, who, if, the, vaccination, cannot, be, given, for, some, reason, dispensation, may, be, possible, in, this, case, an, exemption, certificate, issued, by, a, who, approved, vaccination, center, is, required, although, 32, of, 44, countries, where, yellow, fever, occurs, endemically, do, have, vaccination, programmes, in, many, of, these, countries, less, than, 50, of, their, population, is, vaccinated, control, of, the, yellow, fever, mosquito, a, aegypti, is, of, major, importance, especially, because, the, same, mosquito, can, also, transmit, dengue, fever, and, chikungunya, disease, a, aegypti, breeds, preferentially, in, water, for, example, in, installations, by, inhabitants, of, areas, with, precarious, drinking, water, supplies, or, in, domestic, refuse, especially, tires, cans, and, plastic, bottles, these, conditions, are, common, in, urban, areas, in, developing, countries, two, main, strategies, are, employed, to, reduce, a, aegypti, populations, one, approach, is, to, kill, the, developing, larvae, measures, are, taken, to, reduce, the, water, accumulations, in, which, the, larvae, develop, larvicides, are, used, along, with, larvae, eating, fish, and, copepods, which, reduce, the, number, of, larvae, for, many, years, copepods, of, the, genus, mesocyclops, have, been, used, in, vietnam, for, preventing, dengue, fever, this, eradicated, the, mosquito, vector, in, several, areas, similar, efforts, may, prove, effective, against, yellow, fever, pyriproxyfen, is, recommended, as, a, chemical, larvicide, mainly, because, it, is, safe, for, humans, and, effective, in, small, doses, the, second, strategy, is, to, reduce, populations, of, the, adult, yellow, fever, mosquito, lethal, ovitraps, can, reduce, aedes, populations, using, lesser, amounts, of, pesticide, because, it, targets, the, pest, directly, curtains, and, lids, of, water, tanks, can, be, sprayed, with, insecticides, but, application, inside, houses, is, not, recommended, by, the, who, insecticide, treated, mosquito, nets, are, effective, just, as, they, are, against, the, anopheles, mosquito, that, carries, malaria, as, with, other, flavivirus, infections, no, cure, is, known, for, yellow, fever, hospitalization, is, advisable, and, intensive, care, may, be, necessary, because, of, rapid, deterioration, in, some, cases, certain, acute, treatment, methods, lack, efficacy, passive, immunization, after, the, emergence, of, symptoms, is, probably, without, effect, ribavirin, and, other, antiviral, drugs, as, well, as, treatment, with, interferons, are, ineffective, in, yellow, fever, patients, symptomatic, treatment, includes, rehydration, and, pain, relief, with, drugs, such, as, paracetamol, acetaminophen, however, aspirin, and, other, non, steroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, nsaids, are, often, avoided, because, of, an, increased, risk, of, gastrointestinal, bleeding, due, to, their, anticoagulant, effects, yellow, fever, is, common, in, tropical, and, subtropical, areas, of, south, america, and, africa, worldwide, about, 600, million, people, live, in, endemic, areas, the, who, estimates, 200, 000, cases, of, yellow, fever, worldwide, each, year, about, 15, of, people, infected, with, yellow, fever, progress, to, a, severe, form, of, the, illness, and, up, to, half, of, those, will, die, as, there, is, no, cure, for, yellow, fever, an, estimated, 90, of, yellow, fever, infections, occur, on, the, african, continent, in, 2016, a, large, outbreak, originated, in, angola, and, spread, to, neighboring, countries, before, being, contained, by, a, massive, vaccination, campaign, in, march, and, april, 2016, 11, imported, cases, of, the, angola, genotype, in, unvaccinated, chinese, nationals, were, reported, in, china, the, first, appearance, of, the, disease, in, asia, in, recorded, history, phylogenetic, analysis, has, identified, seven, genotypes, of, yellow, fever, viruses, and, they, are, assumed, to, be, differently, adapted, to, humans, and, to, the, vector, a, aegypti, five, genotypes, angola, central, east, africa, east, africa, west, africa, i, and, west, africa, ii, occur, only, in, africa, west, africa, genotype, i, is, found, in, nigeria, and, the, surrounding, region, west, africa, genotype, i, appears, to, be, especially, infectious, as, it, is, often, associated, with, major, outbreaks, the, three, genotypes, found, outside, of, nigeria, and, angola, occur, in, areas, where, outbreaks, are, rare, two, outbreaks, in, kenya, 1992, 1993, and, sudan, 2003, and, 2005, involved, the, east, african, genotype, which, had, remained, undetected, in, the, previous, 40, years, in, south, america, two, genotypes, have, been, identified, south, american, genotypes, i, and, ii, based, on, phylogenetic, analysis, these, two, genotypes, appear, to, have, originated, in, west, africa, and, were, first, introduced, into, brazil, the, date, of, introduction, of, the, predecessor, african, genotype, which, gave, rise, to, the, south, american, genotypes, appears, to, be, 1822, 95, confidence, interval, 1701, to, 1911, the, historical, record, shows, an, outbreak, of, yellow, fever, occurred, in, recife, brazil, between, 1685, and, 1690, the, disease, seems, to, have, disappeared, with, the, next, outbreak, occurring, in, 1849, it, was, likely, introduced, with, the, trafficking, of, slaves, through, the, slave, trade, from, africa, genotype, i, has, been, divided, into, five, subclades, a, through, e, in, late, 2016, a, large, outbreak, began, in, minas, gerais, state, of, brazil, that, was, characterized, as, a, sylvatic, or, jungle, epizootic, real, time, phylogenetic, investigations, at, the, epicentre, of, the, outbreak, revealed, that, the, outbreak, was, caused, by, the, introduction, of, a, virus, lineage, from, the, amazon, region, into, the, southeast, region, around, july, 2016, spreading, rapidly, across, several, neotropical, monkey, species, including, brown, howler, monkeys, which, serve, as, a, sentinel, species, for, yellow, fever, no, cases, had, been, transmitted, between, humans, by, the, a, aegypti, mosquito, which, can, sustain, urban, outbreaks, that, can, spread, rapidly, in, april, 2017, the, sylvatic, outbreak, continued, moving, toward, the, brazilian, coast, where, most, people, were, unvaccinated, by, the, end, of, may, the, outbreak, appeared, to, be, declining, after, more, than, 3, 000, suspected, cases, 758, confirmed, and, 264, deaths, confirmed, to, be, yellow, fever, the, health, ministry, launched, a, vaccination, campaign, and, was, concerned, about, spread, during, the, carnival, season, in, february, and, march, the, cdc, issued, a, level, 2, alert, practice, enhanced, precautions, a, bayesian, analysis, of, genotypes, i, and, ii, has, shown, that, genotype, i, accounts, for, virtually, all, the, current, infections, in, brazil, colombia, venezuela, and, trinidad, and, tobago, while, genotype, ii, accounted, for, all, cases, in, peru, genotype, i, originated, in, the, northern, brazilian, region, around, 1908, 95, highest, posterior, density, interval, 1870, 1936, genotype, ii, originated, in, peru, in, 1920, 95, hpd, 1867, 1958, the, estimated, rate, of, mutation, for, both, genotypes, was, about, 5, 10, 4, substitutions, site, year, similar, to, that, of, other, rna, viruses, the, main, vector, a, aegypti, also, occurs, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, of, asia, the, pacific, and, australia, but, yellow, fever, had, never, occurred, there, until, jet, travel, introduced, 11, cases, from, the, 2016, angola, and, dr, congo, yellow, fever, outbreak, in, africa, proposed, explanations, include, but, none, is, considered, satisfactory, another, proposal, is, the, absence, of, a, slave, trade, to, asia, on, the, scale, of, that, to, the, americas, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, probably, introduced, yellow, fever, into, the, western, hemisphere, from, africa, the, evolutionary, origins, of, yellow, fever, most, likely, lie, in, africa, with, transmission, of, the, disease, from, nonhuman, primates, to, humans, the, virus, is, thought, to, have, originated, in, east, or, central, africa, and, spread, from, there, to, west, africa, as, it, was, endemic, in, africa, local, populations, had, developed, some, immunity, to, it, when, an, outbreak, of, yellow, fever, would, occur, in, an, african, community, where, colonists, resided, most, europeans, died, while, the, indigenous, africans, usually, developed, nonlethal, symptoms, resembling, influenza, this, phenomenon, in, which, certain, populations, develop, immunity, to, yellow, fever, due, to, prolonged, exposure, in, their, childhood, is, known, as, acquired, immunity, the, virus, as, well, as, the, vector, a, aegypti, were, probably, transferred, to, north, and, south, america, with, the, trafficking, of, slaves, from, africa, part, of, the, columbian, exchange, following, european, exploration, and, colonization, however, some, researchers, have, argued, that, yellow, fever, might, have, existed, in, the, americas, during, the, pre, columbian, period, as, mosquitoes, of, the, genus, haemagogus, which, is, indigenous, to, the, americas, have, been, known, to, carry, the, disease, the, first, definitive, outbreak, of, yellow, fever, in, the, new, world, was, in, 1647, on, the, island, of, barbados, an, outbreak, was, recorded, by, spanish, colonists, in, 1648, in, the, yucat, n, peninsula, where, the, indigenous, mayan, people, called, the, illness, xekik, blood, vomit, in, 1685, brazil, suffered, its, first, epidemic, in, recife, the, first, mention, of, the, disease, by, the, name, yellow, fever, occurred, in, 1744, however, dr, mitchell, misdiagnosed, the, disease, that, he, observed, and, treated, and, the, disease, was, probably, weil, s, disease, or, hepatitis, mcneill, argues, that, the, environmental, and, ecological, disruption, caused, by, the, introduction, of, sugar, plantations, created, the, conditions, for, mosquito, and, viral, reproduction, and, subsequent, outbreaks, of, yellow, fever, deforestation, reduced, populations, of, insectivorous, birds, and, other, creatures, that, fed, on, mosquitoes, and, their, eggs, in, colonial, times, and, during, the, napoleonic, wars, the, west, indies, were, known, as, a, particularly, dangerous, posting, for, soldiers, due, to, yellow, fever, being, endemic, in, the, area, the, mortality, rate, in, british, garrisons, in, jamaica, was, seven, times, that, of, garrisons, in, canada, mostly, because, of, yellow, fever, and, other, tropical, diseases, both, english, and, french, forces, posted, there, were, seriously, affected, by, the, yellow, jack, wanting, to, regain, control, of, the, lucrative, sugar, trade, in, saint, domingue, hispaniola, and, with, an, eye, on, regaining, france, s, new, world, empire, napoleon, sent, an, army, under, the, command, of, his, brother, in, law, general, charles, leclerc, to, saint, domingue, to, seize, control, after, a, slave, revolt, the, historian, j, r, mcneill, asserts, that, yellow, fever, accounted, for, about, 35, 000, to, 45, 000, casualties, of, these, forces, during, the, fighting, only, one, third, of, the, french, troops, survived, for, withdrawal, and, return, to, france, napoleon, gave, up, on, the, island, and, his, plans, for, north, america, selling, the, louisiana, purchase, to, the, us, in, 1803, in, 1804, haiti, proclaimed, its, independence, as, the, second, republic, in, the, western, hemisphere, considerable, debate, exists, over, whether, the, number, of, deaths, caused, by, disease, in, the, haitian, revolution, was, exaggerated, although, yellow, fever, is, most, prevalent, in, tropical, like, climates, the, northern, united, states, were, not, exempted, from, the, fever, the, first, outbreak, in, english, speaking, north, america, occurred, in, new, york, city, in, 1668, english, colonists, in, philadelphia, and, the, french, in, the, mississippi, river, valley, recorded, major, outbreaks, in, 1669, as, well, as, additional, yellow, fever, epidemics, in, philadelphia, baltimore, and, new, york, city, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, disease, traveled, along, steamboat, routes, from, new, orleans, causing, some, 100, 000, 150, 000, deaths, in, total, the, yellow, fever, epidemic, of, 1793, in, philadelphia, which, was, then, the, capital, of, the, united, states, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, several, thousand, people, more, than, 9, of, the, population, one, of, these, deaths, was, james, hutchinson, a, physician, helping, to, treat, the, population, of, the, city, the, national, government, fled, the, city, to, trenton, new, jersey, including, president, george, washington, the, southern, city, of, new, orleans, was, plagued, with, major, epidemics, during, the, 19th, century, most, notably, in, 1833, and, 1853, a, major, epidemic, occurred, in, both, new, orleans, and, shreveport, louisiana, in, 1873, its, residents, called, the, disease, yellow, jack, urban, epidemics, continued, in, the, united, states, until, 1905, with, the, last, outbreak, affecting, new, orleans, at, least, 25, major, outbreaks, took, place, in, the, americas, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, including, particularly, serious, ones, in, cartagena, chile, in, 1741, cuba, in, 1762, and, 1900, santo, domingo, in, 1803, and, memphis, tennessee, in, 1878, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, prevalence, of, yellow, fever, in, the, caribbean, led, to, serious, health, problems, and, alarmed, the, united, states, navy, as, numerous, deaths, and, sickness, curtailed, naval, operations, and, destroyed, morale, one, episode, began, in, april, 1822, when, the, frigate, uss, macedonian, left, boston, and, became, part, of, commodore, james, biddle, s, west, india, squadron, unbeknownst, to, all, they, were, about, to, embark, on, a, cruise, to, disaster, and, their, assignment, would, prove, a, cruise, through, hell, secretary, of, the, navy, smith, thompson, had, assigned, the, squadron, to, guard, united, states, merchant, shipping, and, suppress, piracy, during, their, time, on, deployment, from, 26, may, to, 3, august, 1822, 76, of, the, macedonian, s, officers, and, men, died, including, john, cadle, surgeon, usn, seventy, four, of, these, deaths, were, attributed, to, yellow, fever, biddle, reported, that, another, 52, of, his, crew, were, on, sick, list, in, their, report, to, the, secretary, of, the, navy, biddle, and, surgeon, s, mate, charles, chase, stated, the, cause, as, fever, as, a, consequence, of, this, loss, biddle, noted, that, his, squadron, was, forced, to, return, to, norfolk, navy, yard, early, upon, arrival, the, macedonian, s, crew, were, provided, medical, care, and, quarantined, at, craney, island, virginia, in, 1853, cloutierville, louisiana, had, a, late, summer, outbreak, of, yellow, fever, that, quickly, killed, 68, of, the, 91, inhabitants, a, local, doctor, concluded, that, some, unspecified, infectious, agent, had, arrived, in, a, package, from, new, orleans, in, 1854, 650, residents, of, savannah, georgia, died, from, yellow, fever, in, 1858, st, matthew, s, german, evangelical, lutheran, church, in, charleston, south, carolina, had, 308, yellow, fever, deaths, reducing, the, congregation, by, half, a, ship, carrying, persons, infected, with, the, virus, arrived, in, hampton, roads, in, southeastern, virginia, in, june, 1855, the, disease, spread, quickly, through, the, community, eventually, killing, over, 3, 000, people, mostly, residents, of, norfolk, and, portsmouth, in, 1873, shreveport, louisiana, lost, 759, citizens, in, an, 80, day, period, to, a, yellow, fever, epidemic, with, over, 400, additional, victims, eventually, succumbing, the, total, death, toll, from, august, through, november, was, approximately, 1, 200, in, 1878, about, 20, 000, people, died, in, a, widespread, epidemic, in, the, mississippi, river, valley, that, year, memphis, had, an, unusually, large, amount, of, rain, which, led, to, an, increase, in, the, mosquito, population, the, result, was, a, huge, epidemic, of, yellow, fever, the, steamship, john, d, porter, took, people, fleeing, memphis, northward, in, hopes, of, escaping, the, disease, but, passengers, were, not, allowed, to, disembark, due, to, concerns, of, spreading, yellow, fever, the, ship, roamed, the, mississippi, river, for, the, next, two, months, before, unloading, her, passengers, major, outbreaks, have, also, occurred, in, southern, europe, gibraltar, lost, many, lives, to, outbreaks, in, 1804, 1814, and, 1828, barcelona, suffered, the, loss, of, several, thousand, citizens, during, an, outbreak, in, 1821, the, duke, de, richelieu, deployed, 30, 000, french, troops, to, the, border, between, france, and, spain, in, the, pyrenees, mountains, to, establish, a, cordon, sanitaire, in, order, to, prevent, the, epidemic, from, spreading, from, spain, into, france, ezekiel, stone, wiggins, known, as, the, ottawa, prophet, proposed, that, the, cause, of, a, yellow, fever, epidemic, in, jacksonville, florida, in, 1888, was, astrological, the, planets, were, in, the, same, line, as, the, sun, and, earth, and, this, produced, besides, cyclones, earthquakes, etc, a, denser, atmosphere, holding, more, carbon, and, creating, microbes, mars, had, an, uncommonly, dense, atmosphere, but, its, inhabitants, were, probably, protected, from, the, fever, by, their, newly, discovered, canals, which, were, perhaps, made, to, absorb, carbon, and, prevent, the, disease, in, 1848, josiah, c, nott, suggested, that, yellow, fever, was, spread, by, insects, such, as, moths, or, mosquitoes, basing, his, ideas, on, the, pattern, of, transmission, of, the, disease, carlos, finlay, a, cuban, spanish, doctor, and, scientist, proposed, in, 1881, that, yellow, fever, might, be, transmitted, by, previously, infected, mosquitoes, rather, than, by, direct, contact, from, person, to, person, as, had, long, been, believed, since, the, losses, from, yellow, fever, in, the, spanish, american, war, in, the, 1890s, were, extremely, high, u, s, army, doctors, began, research, experiments, with, a, team, led, by, walter, reed, and, composed, of, doctors, james, carroll, aristides, agramonte, and, jesse, william, lazear, they, successfully, proved, finlay, s, mosquito, hypothesis, yellow, fever, was, the, first, virus, shown, to, be, transmitted, by, mosquitoes, the, physician, william, gorgas, applied, these, insights, and, eradicated, yellow, fever, from, havana, he, also, campaigned, against, yellow, fever, during, the, construction, of, the, panama, canal, a, previous, effort, of, canal, building, by, the, french, had, failed, in, part, due, to, mortality, from, the, high, incidence, of, yellow, fever, and, malaria, which, killed, many, workers, although, reed, has, received, much, of, the, credit, in, united, states, history, books, for, beating, yellow, fever, he, had, fully, credited, finlay, with, the, discovery, of, the, yellow, fever, vector, and, how, it, might, be, controlled, reed, often, cited, finlay, s, papers, in, his, own, articles, and, also, credited, him, for, the, discovery, in, his, personal, correspondence, the, acceptance, of, finlay, s, work, was, one, of, the, most, important, and, far, reaching, effects, of, the, u, s, army, yellow, fever, commission, of, 1900, applying, methods, first, suggested, by, finlay, the, united, states, government, and, army, eradicated, yellow, fever, in, cuba, and, later, in, panama, allowing, completion, of, the, panama, canal, while, reed, built, on, the, research, of, finlay, historian, fran, ois, delaporte, notes, that, yellow, fever, research, was, a, contentious, issue, scientists, including, finlay, and, reed, became, successful, by, building, on, the, work, of, less, prominent, scientists, without, always, giving, them, the, credit, they, were, due, reed, s, research, was, essential, in, the, fight, against, yellow, fever, he, is, also, credited, for, using, the, first, type, of, medical, consent, form, during, his, experiments, in, cuba, an, attempt, to, ensure, that, participants, knew, they, were, taking, a, risk, by, being, part, of, testing, like, cuba, and, panama, brazil, also, led, a, highly, successful, sanitation, campaign, against, mosquitoes, and, yellow, fever, beginning, in, 1903, the, campaign, led, by, oswaldo, cruz, then, director, general, of, public, health, resulted, not, only, in, eradicating, the, disease, but, also, in, reshaping, the, physical, landscape, of, brazilian, cities, such, as, rio, de, janeiro, during, rainy, seasons, rio, de, janeiro, had, regularly, suffered, floods, as, water, from, the, bay, surrounding, the, city, overflowed, into, rio, s, narrow, streets, coupled, with, the, poor, drainage, systems, found, throughout, rio, this, created, swampy, conditions, in, the, city, s, neighborhoods, pools, of, stagnant, water, stood, year, long, in, city, streets, and, proved, to, be, a, fertile, ground, for, disease, carrying, mosquitoes, thus, under, cruz, s, direction, public, health, units, known, as, mosquito, inspectors, fiercely, worked, to, combat, yellow, fever, throughout, rio, by, spraying, exterminating, rats, improving, drainage, and, destroying, unsanitary, housing, ultimately, the, city, s, sanitation, and, renovation, campaigns, reshaped, rio, de, janeiro, s, neighborhoods, its, poor, residents, were, pushed, from, city, centers, to, rio, s, suburbs, or, to, towns, found, in, the, outskirts, of, the, city, in, later, years, rio, s, most, impoverished, inhabitants, would, come, to, reside, in, favelas, during, 1920, 1923, the, rockefeller, foundation, s, international, health, board, undertook, an, expensive, and, successful, yellow, fever, eradication, campaign, in, mexico, the, ihb, gained, the, respect, of, mexico, s, federal, government, because, of, the, success, the, eradication, of, yellow, fever, strengthened, the, relationship, between, the, us, and, mexico, which, had, not, been, very, good, in, the, years, prior, the, eradication, of, yellow, fever, was, also, a, major, step, toward, better, global, health, in, 1927, scientists, isolated, the, yellow, fever, virus, in, west, africa, following, this, two, vaccines, were, developed, in, the, 1930s, max, theiler, led, the, completion, of, the, 17d, yellow, fever, vaccine, in, 1937, for, which, he, was, subsequently, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, that, vaccine, 17d, is, still, in, use, although, newer, vaccines, based, on, vero, cells, are, in, development, as, of, 2018, using, vector, control, and, strict, vaccination, programs, the, urban, cycle, of, yellow, fever, was, nearly, eradicated, from, south, america, since, 1943, only, a, single, urban, outbreak, in, santa, cruz, de, la, sierra, bolivia, has, occurred, since, the, 1980s, however, the, number, of, yellow, fever, cases, has, been, increasing, again, and, a, aegypti, has, returned, to, the, urban, centers, of, south, america, this, is, partly, due, to, limitations, on, available, insecticides, as, well, as, habitat, dislocations, caused, by, climate, change, it, is, also, because, the, vector, control, program, was, abandoned, although, no, new, urban, cycle, has, yet, been, established, scientists, believe, this, could, happen, again, at, any, point, an, outbreak, in, paraguay, in, 2008, was, thought, to, be, urban, in, nature, but, this, ultimately, proved, not, to, be, the, case, in, africa, virus, eradication, programs, have, mostly, relied, upon, vaccination, these, programs, have, largely, been, unsuccessful, because, they, were, unable, to, break, the, sylvatic, cycle, involving, wild, primates, with, few, countries, establishing, regular, vaccination, programs, measures, to, fight, yellow, fever, have, been, neglected, making, the, future, spread, of, the, virus, more, likely, in, the, hamster, model, of, yellow, fever, early, administration, of, the, antiviral, ribavirin, is, an, effective, treatment, of, many, pathological, features, of, the, disease, ribavirin, treatment, during, the, first, five, days, after, virus, infection, improved, survival, rates, reduced, tissue, damage, in, the, liver, and, spleen, prevented, hepatocellular, steatosis, and, normalised, levels, of, alanine, aminotransferase, a, liver, damage, marker, the, mechanism, of, action, of, ribavirin, in, reducing, liver, pathology, in, yellow, fever, virus, infection, may, be, similar, to, its, activity, in, treatment, of, hepatitis, c, a, related, virus, because, ribavirin, had, failed, to, improve, survival, in, a, virulent, rhesus, model, of, yellow, fever, infection, it, had, been, previously, discounted, as, a, possible, therapy, infection, was, reduced, in, mosquitoes, with, the, wmel, strain, of, wolbachia, yellow, fever, has, been, researched, by, several, countries, as, a, potential, biological, weapon
