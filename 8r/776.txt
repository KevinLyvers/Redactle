s, c, caffer, s, c, nanus, s, c, brachyceros, s, c, aequinoctialis, s, c, mathewsi, the, african, buffalo, syncerus, caffer, is, a, large, sub, saharan, african, bovine, there, are, five, subspecies, that, are, recognized, as, being, valid, syncerus, caffer, caffer, the, cape, buffalo, is, the, nominotypical, subspecies, and, the, largest, one, found, in, southern, africa, and, east, africa, s, c, nanus, the, forest, buffalo, is, the, smallest, subspecies, common, in, forest, areas, of, central, africa, and, west, africa, while, s, c, brachyceros, is, in, west, africa, and, s, c, aequinoctialis, is, in, the, savannas, of, east, africa, the, adult, african, buffalo, s, horns, are, its, characteristic, feature, they, have, fused, bases, forming, a, continuous, bone, shield, across, the, top, of, the, head, referred, to, as, a, boss, the, african, buffalo, is, more, closely, related, to, other, buffalo, species, than, it, is, to, other, bovids, such, as, american, bison, or, domestic, cattle, with, its, closest, living, relative, being, the, asian, water, buffalo, its, unpredictable, temperament, may, be, part, of, the, reason, that, the, african, buffalo, has, never, been, domesticated, which, would, also, explain, why, the, african, buffalo, has, no, domesticated, descendants, unlike, the, wild, yak, and, wild, water, buffalo, which, are, the, ancestors, of, the, domestic, yak, and, water, buffalo, natural, predators, of, adult, african, buffaloes, include, lions, african, wild, dogs, spotted, hyenas, and, nile, crocodiles, as, one, of, the, big, five, game, animals, the, cape, buffalo, is, a, sought, after, trophy, in, hunting, the, african, buffalo, is, a, very, robust, species, its, shoulder, height, can, range, from, 1, 0, to, 1, 7, m, 3, 3, to, 5, 6, ft, and, its, head, and, body, length, can, range, from, 1, 7, to, 3, 4, m, 5, 6, to, 11, 2, ft, the, tail, can, range, from, 70, to, 110, cm, 28, to, 43, in, long, compared, with, other, large, bovids, it, has, a, long, but, stocky, body, the, body, length, can, exceed, the, wild, water, buffalo, which, is, heavier, and, taller, and, short, but, thickset, legs, resulting, in, a, relatively, short, standing, height, cape, buffaloes, weigh, 425, to, 870, kg, 937, to, 1, 918, lb, males, weigh, about, 100, kg, 220, lb, more, than, females, in, comparison, african, forest, buffaloes, at, 250, to, 450, kg, 600, to, 1, 000, lb, are, only, half, that, size, its, head, is, carried, low, its, top, is, located, below, the, backline, the, front, hooves, of, the, buffalo, are, wider, than, the, rear, which, is, associated, with, the, need, to, support, the, weight, of, the, front, part, of, the, body, which, is, heavier, and, more, powerful, than, the, back, savannah, type, buffaloes, have, black, or, dark, brown, coats, with, age, old, bulls, often, have, whitish, circles, around, their, eyes, and, on, their, face, females, tend, to, have, more, reddish, coats, forest, type, buffaloes, are, 30, 40, smaller, reddish, brown, in, colour, with, much, more, hair, growth, around, the, ears, and, with, horns, that, curve, back, and, slightly, up, calves, of, both, types, have, red, coats, a, characteristic, feature, of, the, horns, of, adult, male, african, buffalo, southern, and, eastern, populations, is, that, the, bases, come, very, close, together, forming, a, shield, referred, to, as, a, boss, from, the, base, the, horns, diverge, downwards, then, smoothly, curve, upwards, and, outwards, and, in, some, cases, inwards, and, or, backwards, in, large, bulls, the, distance, between, the, ends, of, the, horns, can, reach, upwards, of, one, metre, the, record, being, 64, 5, inches, 164, cm, the, horns, form, fully, when, the, animal, reaches, the, age, of, 5, or, 6, years, old, but, the, bosses, do, not, become, hard, until, it, reaches, the, age, of, 8, to, 9, years, old, in, cows, the, horns, are, on, average, 10, 20, smaller, and, they, do, not, have, a, boss, forest, type, buffalo, horns, are, smaller, than, those, of, the, savanna, type, buffaloes, from, southern, and, east, africa, usually, measuring, less, than, 40, cm, 16, in, and, are, almost, never, fused, unlike, other, large, bovines, african, buffalo, have, 52, chromosomes, for, comparison, american, bison, and, domestic, cattle, have, 60, this, means, domestic, cattle, and, bison, are, unable, to, create, hybrid, offspring, with, cape, buffalo, the, african, buffalo, is, one, of, the, most, successful, grazers, in, africa, it, lives, in, savannas, swamps, and, floodplains, as, well, as, mopane, grasslands, and, the, forests, of, the, major, mountains, of, africa, this, buffalo, prefers, a, habitat, with, dense, cover, such, as, reeds, and, thickets, but, can, also, be, found, in, open, woodland, while, not, particularly, demanding, in, regard, to, habitat, they, require, water, daily, and, so, they, depend, on, perennial, sources, of, water, like, the, plains, zebra, the, buffalo, can, live, on, tall, coarse, grasses, herds, of, buffalo, mow, down, grasses, and, make, way, for, more, selective, grazers, when, feeding, the, buffalo, makes, use, of, its, tongue, and, wide, incisor, row, to, eat, grass, more, quickly, than, most, other, african, herbivores, buffaloes, do, not, stay, on, trampled, or, depleted, areas, for, long, other, than, humans, african, buffaloes, have, few, predators, and, are, capable, of, defending, themselves, against, and, killing, lions, lions, kill, and, eat, buffaloes, regularly, and, in, some, regions, the, buffaloes, are, the, lions, primary, prey, it, often, takes, several, lions, to, bring, down, a, single, adult, buffalo, and, the, entire, pride, may, join, in, the, hunt, however, several, incidents, have, been, reported, in, which, lone, adult, male, lions, have, successfully, brought, down, adult, buffaloes, on, very, rare, occasions, buffaloes, and, white, rhinos, will, fight, over, territory, due, to, the, rhino, s, strength, and, size, advantage, the, rhino, typically, wins, and, the, buffalo, can, die, from, injuries, sustained, during, the, encounter, rhinos, live, solitary, lives, whereas, buffalo, excluding, solitary, adult, bulls, primarily, live, social, lives, and, thus, they, do, not, usually, recognize, each, other, as, threats, hippopotamuses, and, buffalo, also, do, not, normally, interact, but, if, the, buffalo, provokes, the, hippo, or, makes, it, feel, threatened, a, fight, can, break, out, but, this, is, also, rare, adolescent, bull, african, elephants, may, harass, or, kill, cape, buffalo, either, out, of, territorial, aggression, or, while, in, musth, when, they, do, this, the, calves, are, most, likely, to, be, killed, by, the, elephant, attack, as, they, are, defenseless, when, facing, an, elephant, alone, whereas, adults, will, try, to, fight, back, and, may, survive, or, succumb, to, injuries, afterward, the, average, sized, nile, crocodile, typically, attacks, only, old, solitary, animals, and, young, calves, though, they, can, kill, healthy, adults, exceptionally, large, old, male, crocodiles, may, become, semi, habitual, predators, of, buffaloes, the, cheetah, leopard, african, wild, dog, and, spotted, hyena, are, normally, a, threat, only, to, newborn, calves, though, larger, clans, of, hyenas, have, been, recorded, killing, cows, mainly, pregnant, ones, and, on, rare, occasions, full, grown, bulls, large, packs, of, wild, dogs, have, been, observed, to, hunt, calves, and, sick, adults, the, african, buffalo, is, susceptible, to, many, diseases, including, those, shared, with, domestic, cattle, such, as, bovine, tuberculosis, corridor, disease, and, foot, and, mouth, disease, as, with, many, diseases, these, problems, remain, dormant, within, a, population, as, long, as, the, health, of, the, animals, is, good, these, diseases, do, however, restrict, the, legal, movements, of, the, animals, and, fencing, infected, areas, from, unaffected, areas, is, enforced, some, wardens, and, game, managers, have, managed, to, protect, and, breed, disease, free, herds, which, become, very, valuable, because, they, can, be, transported, most, well, known, are, lindsay, hunt, s, efforts, to, source, uninfected, animals, from, the, kruger, national, park, in, south, africa, some, disease, free, buffaloes, in, south, africa, have, been, sold, to, breeders, for, close, to, us, 130, 000, herd, size, is, highly, variable, the, core, of, the, herds, is, made, up, of, related, females, and, their, offspring, in, an, almost, linear, dominance, hierarchy, the, basic, herds, are, surrounded, by, subherds, of, subordinate, males, high, ranking, males, and, females, and, old, or, invalid, animals, african, buffaloes, engage, in, several, types, of, group, behavior, females, appear, to, exhibit, a, sort, of, voting, behavior, during, resting, time, the, females, stand, up, shuffle, around, and, sit, back, down, again, they, sit, in, the, direction, they, think, they, should, move, after, an, hour, of, more, shuffling, the, females, travel, in, the, direction, they, decide, this, decision, is, communal, and, not, based, on, hierarchy, or, dominance, when, chased, by, predators, a, herd, sticks, close, together, and, makes, it, hard, for, the, predators, to, pick, off, one, member, calves, are, gathered, in, the, middle, a, buffalo, herd, responds, to, the, distress, call, of, a, threatened, member, and, tries, to, rescue, it, a, calf, s, distress, call, gets, the, attention, of, not, only, the, mother, but, also, the, herd, buffaloes, engage, in, mobbing, behavior, when, fighting, off, predators, they, have, been, recorded, killing, lions, and, chasing, lions, up, trees, and, keeping, them, there, for, two, hours, after, the, lions, have, killed, a, member, of, their, group, lion, cubs, can, get, trampled, and, killed, in, one, videotaped, instance, known, as, the, battle, at, kruger, a, calf, survived, an, attack, by, both, lions, and, a, crocodile, after, intervention, of, the, herd, males, have, a, linear, dominance, hierarchy, based, on, age, and, size, since, a, buffalo, is, safer, when, a, herd, is, larger, dominant, bulls, may, rely, on, subordinate, bulls, and, sometimes, tolerate, their, copulation, the, young, males, keep, their, distance, from, the, dominant, bull, which, is, recognizable, by, the, thickness, of, his, horns, adult, bulls, spar, in, play, dominance, interactions, or, actual, fights, a, bull, approaches, another, lowing, with, his, horns, down, and, waits, for, the, other, bull, to, do, the, same, thing, when, sparring, the, bulls, twist, their, horns, from, side, to, side, if, the, sparring, is, for, play, the, bull, may, rub, his, opponent, s, face, and, body, during, the, sparring, session, actual, fights, are, violent, but, rare, and, brief, calves, may, also, spar, in, play, but, adult, females, rarely, spar, at, all, during, the, dry, season, males, split, from, the, herd, and, form, bachelor, groups, two, types, of, bachelor, herds, occur, ones, made, of, males, aged, four, to, seven, years, and, those, of, males, 12, years, or, older, during, the, wet, season, the, younger, bulls, rejoin, a, herd, to, mate, with, the, females, they, stay, with, them, throughout, the, season, to, protect, the, calves, some, older, bulls, cease, to, rejoin, the, herd, as, they, can, no, longer, compete, with, the, younger, more, aggressive, males, the, old, bachelors, are, called, dagga, boy, s, mud, covered, and, are, considered, the, most, dangerous, to, humans, african, buffaloes, make, various, vocalizations, many, calls, are, lower, pitched, versions, of, those, emitted, by, domestic, cattle, they, emit, low, pitched, two, to, four, second, calls, intermittently, at, three, to, six, second, intervals, to, signal, the, herd, to, move, to, signal, to, the, herd, to, change, direction, leaders, emit, gritty, creaking, gate, sounds, when, moving, to, drinking, places, some, individuals, make, long, maaa, calls, up, to, 20, times, a, minute, when, being, aggressive, they, make, explosive, grunts, that, may, last, long, or, turn, into, a, rumbling, growl, cows, produce, croaking, calls, when, looking, for, their, calves, calves, make, a, similar, call, of, a, higher, pitch, when, in, distress, when, threatened, by, predators, they, make, drawn, out, waaaa, calls, dominant, individuals, make, calls, to, announce, their, presence, and, location, a, version, of, the, same, call, but, more, intense, is, emitted, as, a, warning, to, an, encroaching, inferior, when, grazing, they, make, various, sounds, such, as, brief, bellows, grunts, honks, and, croaks, females, reach, sexual, maturity, at, around, five, years, of, age, while, males, are, sexually, matured, at, four, to, six, african, buffaloes, mate, and, give, birth, only, during, the, rainy, seasons, birth, peak, takes, place, early, in, the, season, while, mating, peaks, later, a, bull, closely, guards, a, cow, that, comes, into, heat, while, keeping, other, bulls, at, bay, this, is, difficult, as, cows, are, quite, evasive, and, attract, many, males, to, the, scene, by, the, time, a, cow, is, in, full, estrus, only, the, most, dominant, bull, in, the, herd, subherd, is, there, cows, first, calve, at, five, years, of, age, after, a, gestation, period, of, 11, 5, months, newborn, calves, remain, hidden, in, vegetation, for, the, first, few, weeks, while, being, nursed, occasionally, by, the, mother, before, joining, the, main, herd, older, calves, are, held, in, the, centre, of, the, herd, for, safety, the, maternal, bond, between, mother, and, calf, lasts, longer, than, in, most, bovids, that, bonding, ends, when, a, new, calf, is, born, and, the, mother, then, keeps, her, previous, offspring, at, bay, with, horn, jabs, nevertheless, the, yearling, follows, its, mother, for, another, year, or, so, males, leave, their, mothers, when, they, are, two, years, old, and, join, the, bachelor, groups, young, calves, unusually, for, bovids, suckle, from, behind, their, mothers, pushing, their, heads, between, the, mothers, legs, in, the, wild, african, buffaloes, have, an, average, lifespan, of, 11, years, but, they, ve, been, recorded, to, reach, 22, years, of, age, in, captivity, they, can, live, for, a, maximum, of, 29, 5, years, though, they, only, live, 16, years, on, average, the, current, status, of, the, african, buffalo, is, dependent, on, the, animal, s, value, to, both, trophy, hunters, and, tourists, paving, the, way, for, conservation, efforts, through, anti, poaching, patrols, village, crop, damage, payouts, and, campfire, payback, programs, to, local, areas, the, african, buffalo, is, listed, as, near, threatened, by, the, iucn, with, a, decreasing, population, of, 400, 000, individuals, while, some, populations, subspecies, are, decreasing, others, will, remain, unchanged, in, the, long, term, if, large, healthy, populations, continue, to, persist, in, a, substantial, number, of, national, parks, equivalent, reserves, and, hunting, zones, in, southern, and, eastern, africa, in, the, most, recent, and, available, census, data, at, continental, scale, the, total, estimated, numbers, of, the, three, savanna, type, african, buffalo, subspecies, s, c, caffer, s, c, brachyceros, and, s, c, aequinoctialis, are, at, 513, 000, individuals, in, the, past, numbers, of, african, buffaloes, suffered, their, most, severe, collapse, during, the, great, rinderpest, epidemic, of, the, 1890s, which, coupled, with, pleuro, pneumonia, caused, mortalities, as, high, as, 95, among, livestock, and, wild, ungulates, being, a, member, of, the, big, five, game, group, a, term, originally, used, to, describe, the, five, most, dangerous, animals, to, hunt, the, cape, buffalo, is, a, sought, after, trophy, with, some, hunters, paying, over, 10, 000, for, the, opportunity, to, hunt, one, the, larger, bulls, are, targeted, for, their, trophy, value, although, in, some, areas, buffaloes, are, still, hunted, for, meat, one, of, the, big, five, african, game, it, is, known, as, the, black, death, or, the, widowmaker, and, is, widely, regarded, as, a, very, dangerous, animal, african, buffaloes, are, sometimes, reported, to, kill, more, people, in, africa, than, any, other, animal, although, the, same, claim, is, also, made, of, hippopotamuses, and, crocodiles, these, numbers, may, be, somewhat, overestimated, for, example, in, the, country, of, mozambique, attacks, especially, fatal, ones, were, much, less, frequent, on, humans, than, those, by, hippos, and, especially, nile, crocodiles, in, uganda, on, the, other, hand, large, herbivores, were, found, to, attack, more, people, on, average, than, lions, or, leopards, and, have, a, higher, rate, of, inflicting, fatalities, during, attacks, than, the, predators, the, african, buffalo, in, particular, killing, humans, in, 49, 5, of, attacks, on, them, but, hippos, and, even, elephants, may, still, kill, more, people, per, annum, than, buffaloes, african, buffaloes, are, notorious, among, big, game, hunters, as, very, dangerous, animals, with, wounded, animals, reported, to, ambush, and, attack, pursuers
