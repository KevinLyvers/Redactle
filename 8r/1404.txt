the, common, cold, or, the, cold, is, a, viral, infectious, disease, of, the, upper, respiratory, tract, that, primarily, affects, the, respiratory, mucosa, of, the, nose, throat, sinuses, and, larynx, signs, and, symptoms, may, appear, in, as, little, as, two, days, after, exposure, to, the, virus, these, may, include, coughing, sore, throat, runny, nose, sneezing, headache, and, fever, people, usually, recover, in, seven, to, ten, days, but, some, symptoms, may, last, up, to, three, weeks, occasionally, those, with, other, health, problems, may, develop, pneumonia, well, over, 200, virus, strains, are, implicated, in, causing, the, common, cold, with, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, and, enteroviruses, being, the, most, common, they, spread, through, the, air, or, indirectly, through, contact, with, objects, in, the, environment, followed, by, transfer, to, the, mouth, or, nose, risk, factors, include, going, to, child, care, facilities, not, sleeping, well, and, psychological, stress, the, symptoms, are, mostly, due, to, the, body, s, immune, response, to, the, infection, rather, than, to, tissue, destruction, by, the, viruses, themselves, the, symptoms, of, influenza, are, similar, to, those, of, a, cold, although, usually, more, severe, and, less, likely, to, include, a, runny, nose, there, is, no, vaccine, for, the, common, cold, the, primary, methods, of, prevention, are, hand, washing, not, touching, the, eyes, nose, or, mouth, with, unwashed, hands, and, staying, away, from, sick, people, some, evidence, supports, the, use, of, face, masks, there, is, also, no, cure, but, the, symptoms, can, be, treated, zinc, may, reduce, the, duration, and, severity, of, symptoms, if, started, shortly, after, the, onset, of, symptoms, nonsteroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, nsaids, such, as, ibuprofen, may, help, with, pain, antibiotics, however, should, not, be, used, as, all, colds, are, caused, by, viruses, and, there, is, no, good, evidence, that, cough, medicines, are, effective, the, common, cold, is, the, most, frequent, infectious, disease, in, humans, under, normal, circumstances, the, average, adult, gets, two, to, three, colds, a, year, while, the, average, child, may, get, six, to, eight, infections, occur, more, commonly, during, the, winter, these, infections, have, existed, throughout, human, history, the, typical, symptoms, of, a, cold, include, cough, runny, nose, sneezing, nasal, congestion, and, a, sore, throat, sometimes, accompanied, by, muscle, ache, fatigue, headache, and, loss, of, appetite, a, sore, throat, is, present, in, about, 40, of, cases, a, cough, in, about, 50, and, muscle, aches, in, about, 50, in, adults, a, fever, is, generally, not, present, but, it, is, common, in, infants, and, young, children, the, cough, is, usually, mild, compared, to, that, accompanying, influenza, while, a, cough, and, a, fever, indicate, a, higher, likelihood, of, influenza, in, adults, a, great, deal, of, similarity, exists, between, these, two, conditions, a, number, of, the, viruses, that, cause, the, common, cold, may, also, result, in, asymptomatic, infections, the, color, of, the, mucus, or, nasal, secretion, may, vary, from, clear, to, yellow, to, green, and, does, not, indicate, the, class, of, agent, causing, the, infection, a, cold, usually, begins, with, fatigue, a, feeling, of, being, chilled, sneezing, and, a, headache, followed, in, a, couple, of, days, by, a, runny, nose, and, cough, symptoms, may, begin, within, sixteen, hours, of, exposure, and, typically, peak, two, to, four, days, after, onset, they, usually, resolve, in, seven, to, ten, days, but, some, can, last, for, up, to, three, weeks, the, average, duration, of, cough, is, eighteen, days, and, in, some, cases, people, develop, a, post, viral, cough, which, can, linger, after, the, infection, is, gone, in, children, the, cough, lasts, for, more, than, ten, days, in, 35, 40, of, cases, and, continues, for, more, than, 25, days, in, 10, the, common, cold, is, an, infection, of, the, upper, respiratory, tract, which, can, be, caused, by, many, different, viruses, the, most, commonly, implicated, is, a, rhinovirus, 30, 80, a, type, of, picornavirus, with, 99, known, serotypes, other, commonly, implicated, viruses, include, adenoviruses, enteroviruses, parainfluenza, and, rsv, frequently, more, than, one, virus, is, present, in, total, more, than, 200, viral, types, are, associated, with, colds, the, viral, cause, of, some, common, colds, 20, 30, is, unknown, the, common, cold, virus, is, typically, transmitted, via, airborne, droplets, direct, contact, with, infected, nasal, secretions, or, fomites, contaminated, objects, which, of, these, routes, is, of, primary, importance, has, not, been, determined, as, with, all, respiratory, pathogens, once, presumed, to, transmit, via, respiratory, droplets, it, is, highly, likely, to, be, carried, by, the, aerosols, generated, during, routine, breathing, talking, and, singing, the, viruses, may, survive, for, prolonged, periods, in, the, environment, over, 18, hours, for, rhinoviruses, and, can, be, picked, up, by, people, s, hands, and, subsequently, carried, to, their, eyes, or, noses, where, infection, occurs, transmission, from, animals, is, considered, highly, unlikely, an, outbreak, documented, at, a, british, scientific, base, on, adelaide, island, after, seventeen, weeks, of, isolation, was, thought, to, have, been, caused, by, transmission, from, a, contaminated, object, or, an, asymptomatic, human, carrier, rather, than, from, the, husky, dogs, which, were, also, present, at, the, base, transmission, is, common, in, daycare, and, schools, due, to, the, proximity, of, many, children, with, little, immunity, and, poor, hygiene, these, infections, are, then, brought, home, to, other, members, of, the, family, there, is, no, evidence, that, recirculated, air, during, commercial, flight, is, a, method, of, transmission, people, sitting, close, to, each, other, appear, to, be, at, greater, risk, of, infection, rhinovirus, caused, colds, are, most, infectious, during, the, first, three, days, of, symptoms, they, are, much, less, infectious, afterwards, herd, immunity, generated, from, previous, exposure, to, cold, viruses, plays, an, important, role, in, limiting, viral, spread, as, seen, with, younger, populations, that, have, greater, rates, of, respiratory, infections, poor, immune, function, is, a, risk, factor, for, disease, insufficient, sleep, and, malnutrition, have, been, associated, with, a, greater, risk, of, developing, infection, following, rhinovirus, exposure, this, is, believed, to, be, due, to, their, effects, on, immune, function, breast, feeding, decreases, the, risk, of, acute, otitis, media, and, lower, respiratory, tract, infections, among, other, diseases, and, it, is, recommended, that, breast, feeding, be, continued, when, an, infant, has, a, cold, in, the, developed, world, breast, feeding, may, not, be, protective, against, the, common, cold, in, and, of, itself, the, symptoms, of, the, common, cold, are, believed, to, be, primarily, related, to, the, immune, response, to, the, virus, the, mechanism, of, this, immune, response, is, virus, specific, for, example, the, rhinovirus, is, typically, acquired, by, direct, contact, it, binds, to, humans, via, icam, 1, receptors, and, the, cdhr3, receptor, through, unknown, mechanisms, to, trigger, the, release, of, inflammatory, mediators, these, inflammatory, mediators, then, produce, the, symptoms, it, does, not, generally, cause, damage, to, the, nasal, epithelium, the, respiratory, syncytial, virus, rsv, on, the, other, hand, is, contracted, by, direct, contact, and, airborne, droplets, it, then, replicates, in, the, nose, and, throat, before, spreading, to, the, lower, respiratory, tract, rsv, does, cause, epithelium, damage, human, parainfluenza, virus, typically, results, in, inflammation, of, the, nose, throat, and, bronchi, in, young, children, when, it, affects, the, trachea, it, may, produce, the, symptoms, of, croup, due, to, the, small, size, of, their, airways, the, distinction, between, viral, upper, respiratory, tract, infections, is, loosely, based, on, the, location, of, symptoms, with, the, common, cold, affecting, primarily, the, nose, rhinitis, throat, pharyngitis, and, lungs, bronchitis, there, can, be, significant, overlap, and, more, than, one, area, can, be, affected, self, diagnosis, is, frequent, isolation, of, the, viral, agent, involved, is, rarely, performed, and, it, is, generally, not, possible, to, identify, the, virus, type, through, symptoms, the, only, useful, ways, to, reduce, the, spread, of, cold, viruses, are, physical, and, engineering, measures, such, as, using, correct, hand, washing, technique, respirators, and, improvement, of, indoor, air, in, the, healthcare, environment, gowns, and, disposable, gloves, are, also, used, droplet, precautions, cannot, reliably, protect, against, inhalation, of, common, cold, laden, aerosols, instead, airborne, precautions, such, as, respirators, ventilation, and, hepa, high, merv, filters, are, the, only, reliable, protection, against, cold, laden, aerosols, isolation, or, quarantine, is, not, used, as, the, disease, is, so, widespread, and, symptoms, are, non, specific, there, is, no, vaccine, to, protect, against, the, common, cold, vaccination, has, proven, difficult, as, there, are, so, many, viruses, involved, and, because, they, mutate, rapidly, creation, of, a, broadly, effective, vaccine, is, therefore, highly, improbable, regular, hand, washing, appears, to, be, effective, in, reducing, the, transmission, of, cold, viruses, especially, among, children, whether, the, addition, of, antivirals, or, antibacterials, to, normal, hand, washing, provides, greater, benefit, is, unknown, wearing, face, masks, when, around, people, who, are, infected, may, be, beneficial, however, there, is, insufficient, evidence, for, maintaining, a, greater, social, distance, it, is, unclear, whether, zinc, supplements, affect, the, likelihood, of, contracting, a, cold, routine, vitamin, c, supplements, do, not, reduce, the, risk, or, severity, of, the, common, cold, though, they, may, reduce, its, duration, treatments, of, the, common, cold, primarily, involve, medications, and, other, therapies, for, symptomatic, relief, getting, plenty, of, rest, drinking, fluids, to, maintain, hydration, and, gargling, with, warm, salt, water, are, reasonable, conservative, measures, much, of, the, benefit, from, symptomatic, treatment, is, however, attributed, to, the, placebo, effect, as, of, 2010, no, medications, or, herbal, remedies, had, been, conclusively, demonstrated, to, shorten, the, duration, of, infection, treatments, that, may, help, with, symptoms, include, pain, medication, and, medications, for, fevers, such, as, ibuprofen, and, acetaminophen, paracetamol, however, it, is, not, clear, whether, acetaminophen, helps, with, symptoms, it, is, not, known, if, over, the, counter, cough, medications, are, effective, for, treating, an, acute, cough, cough, medicines, are, not, recommended, for, use, in, children, due, to, a, lack, of, evidence, supporting, effectiveness, and, the, potential, for, harm, in, 2009, canada, restricted, the, use, of, over, the, counter, cough, and, cold, medication, in, children, six, years, and, under, due, to, concerns, regarding, risks, and, unproven, benefits, the, misuse, of, dextromethorphan, an, over, the, counter, cough, medicine, has, led, to, its, ban, in, a, number, of, countries, intranasal, corticosteroids, have, not, been, found, to, be, useful, in, adults, short, term, use, of, nasal, decongestants, may, have, a, small, benefit, antihistamines, may, improve, symptoms, in, the, first, day, or, two, however, there, is, no, longer, term, benefit, and, they, have, adverse, effects, such, as, drowsiness, other, decongestants, such, as, pseudoephedrine, appear, effective, in, adults, combined, oral, analgesics, antihistaminics, and, decongestants, are, generally, effective, for, older, children, and, adults, ipratropium, nasal, spray, may, reduce, the, symptoms, of, a, runny, nose, but, has, little, effect, on, stuffiness, ipratropium, may, also, help, with, coughs, in, adults, the, safety, and, effectiveness, of, nasal, decongestant, use, in, children, is, unclear, due, to, lack, of, studies, it, is, not, known, whether, increased, fluid, intake, improves, symptoms, or, shortens, respiratory, illness, as, of, 2017, heated, and, humidified, air, such, as, via, rhinotherm, is, of, unclear, benefit, one, study, has, found, chest, vapor, rub, to, provide, some, relief, of, nocturnal, cough, congestion, and, sleep, difficulty, some, experts, advise, against, physical, exercise, if, there, are, symptoms, such, as, fever, widespread, muscle, aches, or, fatigue, it, is, regarded, as, safe, to, perform, moderate, exercise, if, the, symptoms, are, confined, to, the, head, including, runny, nose, nasal, congestion, sneezing, or, a, minor, sore, throat, there, is, a, popular, belief, that, having, a, hot, drink, can, help, with, cold, symptoms, but, evidence, to, support, this, is, very, limited, antibiotics, have, no, effect, against, viral, infections, including, the, common, cold, due, to, their, side, effects, antibiotics, cause, overall, harm, but, nevertheless, are, still, frequently, prescribed, some, of, the, reasons, that, antibiotics, are, so, commonly, prescribed, include, people, s, expectations, for, them, physicians, desire, to, help, and, the, difficulty, in, excluding, complications, that, may, be, amenable, to, antibiotics, there, are, no, effective, antiviral, drugs, for, the, common, cold, even, though, some, preliminary, research, has, shown, benefits, antibiotics, may, be, beneficial, in, the, case, of, secondary, bacterial, infection, as, acute, bacterial, rhinosinusitis, abrs, the, european, position, paper, on, rhinosinusitis, and, nasal, polyps, epos, consensus, recommends, a, combination, of, five, signs, and, symptoms, to, assist, in, identifying, acute, bacterial, rhinosinusitis, being, likely, when, 3, of, five, criteria, are, present, discolored, discharge, with, a, unilateral, predominance, severe, local, pain, fever, 38, c, double, sickening, elevation, of, c, reactive, protein, crp, or, erythrocyte, sedimentation, rate, esr, zinc, supplements, may, shorten, the, duration, of, colds, by, up, to, 33, and, reduce, the, severity, of, symptoms, if, supplementation, begins, within, 24, hours, of, the, onset, of, symptoms, some, zinc, remedies, directly, applied, to, the, inside, of, the, nose, have, led, to, the, loss, of, the, sense, of, smell, a, 2017, review, did, not, recommend, the, use, of, zinc, for, the, common, cold, for, various, reasons, whereas, a, 2017, and, 2018, review, both, recommended, the, use, of, zinc, but, also, advocated, further, research, on, the, topic, while, there, are, many, alternative, medicines, and, chinese, herbal, medicines, supposed, to, treat, the, common, cold, there, is, insufficient, scientific, evidence, to, support, their, use, as, of, 2015, there, is, weak, evidence, to, support, nasal, irrigation, with, saline, there, is, no, firm, evidence, that, echinacea, products, or, garlic, provide, any, meaningful, benefit, in, treating, or, preventing, colds, vitamin, c, supplementation, does, not, affect, the, incidence, of, the, common, cold, but, may, reduce, its, duration, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, that, vitamin, d, supplementation, is, efficacious, in, the, prevention, or, treatment, of, respiratory, tract, infections, the, common, cold, is, generally, mild, and, self, limiting, with, most, symptoms, generally, improving, in, a, week, in, children, half, of, cases, resolve, in, 10, days, and, 90, in, 15, days, severe, complications, if, they, occur, are, usually, in, the, very, old, the, very, young, or, those, who, are, immunosuppressed, secondary, bacterial, infections, may, occur, resulting, in, sinusitis, pharyngitis, or, an, ear, infection, it, is, estimated, that, sinusitis, occurs, in, 8, and, ear, infection, in, 30, of, cases, the, common, cold, is, the, most, common, human, disease, and, affects, people, all, over, the, globe, adults, typically, have, two, to, three, infections, annually, and, children, may, have, six, to, ten, colds, a, year, and, up, to, twelve, colds, a, year, for, school, children, rates, of, symptomatic, infections, increase, in, the, elderly, due, to, declining, immunity, a, common, misconception, is, that, one, can, catch, a, cold, merely, through, prolonged, exposure, to, cold, weather, although, it, is, now, known, that, colds, are, viral, infections, the, prevalence, of, many, such, viruses, are, indeed, seasonal, occurring, more, frequently, during, cold, weather, the, reason, for, the, seasonality, has, not, been, conclusively, determined, possible, explanations, may, include, cold, temperature, induced, changes, in, the, respiratory, system, decreased, immune, response, and, low, humidity, causing, an, increase, in, viral, transmission, rates, perhaps, due, to, dry, air, allowing, small, viral, droplets, to, disperse, farther, and, stay, in, the, air, longer, the, apparent, seasonality, may, also, be, due, to, social, factors, such, as, people, spending, more, time, indoors, near, infected, people, and, especially, children, at, school, although, normal, exposure, to, cold, does, not, increase, one, s, risk, of, infection, severe, exposure, leading, to, significant, reduction, of, body, temperature, hypothermia, may, put, one, at, a, greater, risk, for, the, common, cold, although, controversial, the, majority, of, evidence, suggests, that, it, may, increase, susceptibility, to, infection, while, the, cause, of, the, common, cold, was, identified, in, the, 1950s, the, disease, appears, to, have, been, with, humanity, since, its, early, history, its, symptoms, and, treatment, are, described, in, the, egyptian, ebers, papyrus, the, oldest, existing, medical, text, written, before, the, 16th, century, bce, the, name, cold, came, into, use, in, the, 16th, century, due, to, the, similarity, between, its, symptoms, and, those, of, exposure, to, cold, weather, in, the, united, kingdom, the, common, cold, unit, ccu, was, set, up, by, the, medical, research, council, in, 1946, and, it, was, where, the, rhinovirus, was, discovered, in, 1956, in, the, 1970s, the, ccu, demonstrated, that, treatment, with, interferon, during, the, incubation, phase, of, rhinovirus, infection, protects, somewhat, against, the, disease, but, no, practical, treatment, could, be, developed, the, unit, was, closed, in, 1989, two, years, after, it, completed, research, of, zinc, gluconate, lozenges, in, the, prevention, and, treatment, of, rhinovirus, colds, the, only, successful, treatment, in, the, history, of, the, unit, antivirals, have, been, tested, for, effectiveness, in, the, common, cold, as, of, 2009, none, had, been, both, found, effective, and, licensed, for, use, there, are, trials, of, the, anti, viral, drug, pleconaril, which, shows, promise, against, picornaviruses, as, well, as, trials, of, bta, 798, the, oral, form, of, pleconaril, had, safety, issues, and, an, aerosol, form, is, being, studied, the, genomes, of, all, known, human, rhinovirus, strains, have, been, sequenced, the, economic, impact, of, the, common, cold, is, not, well, understood, in, much, of, the, world, in, the, united, states, the, common, cold, leads, to, 75, 100, million, physician, visits, annually, at, a, conservative, cost, estimate, of, 7, 7, billion, per, year, americans, spend, 2, 9, billion, on, over, the, counter, drugs, and, another, 400, million, on, prescription, medicines, for, symptom, relief, more, than, one, third, of, people, who, saw, a, doctor, received, an, antibiotic, prescription, which, has, implications, for, antibiotic, resistance, an, estimated, 22, 189, million, school, days, are, missed, annually, due, to, a, cold, as, a, result, parents, missed, 126, million, workdays, to, stay, home, to, care, for, their, children, when, added, to, the, 150, million, workdays, missed, by, employees, who, have, a, cold, the, total, economic, impact, of, cold, related, work, loss, exceeds, 20, billion, per, year, this, accounts, for, 40, of, time, lost, from, work, in, the, united, states, notes, bibliography
