meiosis, m, a, o, s, s, from, ancient, greek, me, sis, lessening, since, it, is, a, reductional, division, is, a, special, type, of, cell, division, of, germ, cells, in, sexually, reproducing, organisms, that, produces, the, gametes, the, sperm, or, egg, cells, it, involves, two, rounds, of, division, that, ultimately, result, in, four, cells, each, with, only, one, copy, of, each, chromosome, haploid, additionally, prior, to, the, division, genetic, material, from, the, paternal, and, maternal, copies, of, each, chromosome, is, crossed, over, creating, new, combinations, of, code, on, each, chromosome, later, on, during, fertilisation, the, haploid, cells, produced, by, meiosis, from, a, male, and, a, female, will, fuse, to, create, a, zygote, a, cell, with, two, copies, of, each, chromosome, again, errors, in, meiosis, resulting, in, aneuploidy, an, abnormal, number, of, chromosomes, are, the, leading, known, cause, of, miscarriage, and, the, most, frequent, genetic, cause, of, developmental, disabilities, in, meiosis, dna, replication, is, followed, by, two, rounds, of, cell, division, to, produce, four, daughter, cells, each, with, half, the, number, of, chromosomes, as, the, original, parent, cell, the, two, meiotic, divisions, are, known, as, meiosis, i, and, meiosis, ii, before, meiosis, begins, during, s, phase, of, the, cell, cycle, the, dna, of, each, chromosome, is, replicated, so, that, it, consists, of, two, identical, sister, chromatids, which, remain, held, together, through, sister, chromatid, cohesion, this, s, phase, can, be, referred, to, as, premeiotic, s, phase, or, meiotic, s, phase, immediately, following, dna, replication, meiotic, cells, enter, a, prolonged, g, 2, like, stage, known, as, meiotic, prophase, during, this, time, homologous, chromosomes, pair, with, each, other, and, undergo, genetic, recombination, a, programmed, process, in, which, dna, may, be, cut, and, then, repaired, which, allows, them, to, exchange, some, of, their, genetic, information, a, subset, of, recombination, events, results, in, crossovers, which, create, physical, links, known, as, chiasmata, singular, chiasma, for, the, greek, letter, chi, between, the, homologous, chromosomes, in, most, organisms, these, links, can, help, direct, each, pair, of, homologous, chromosomes, to, segregate, away, from, each, other, during, meiosis, i, resulting, in, two, haploid, cells, that, have, half, the, number, of, chromosomes, as, the, parent, cell, during, meiosis, ii, the, cohesion, between, sister, chromatids, is, released, and, they, segregate, from, one, another, as, during, mitosis, in, some, cases, all, four, of, the, meiotic, products, form, gametes, such, as, sperm, spores, or, pollen, in, female, animals, three, of, the, four, meiotic, products, are, typically, eliminated, by, extrusion, into, polar, bodies, and, only, one, cell, develops, to, produce, an, ovum, because, the, number, of, chromosomes, is, halved, during, meiosis, gametes, can, fuse, i, e, fertilization, to, form, a, diploid, zygote, that, contains, two, copies, of, each, chromosome, one, from, each, parent, thus, alternating, cycles, of, meiosis, and, fertilization, enable, sexual, reproduction, with, successive, generations, maintaining, the, same, number, of, chromosomes, for, example, diploid, human, cells, contain, 23, pairs, of, chromosomes, including, 1, pair, of, sex, chromosomes, 46, total, half, of, maternal, origin, and, half, of, paternal, origin, meiosis, produces, haploid, gametes, ova, or, sperm, that, contain, one, set, of, 23, chromosomes, when, two, gametes, an, egg, and, a, sperm, fuse, the, resulting, zygote, is, once, again, diploid, with, the, mother, and, father, each, contributing, 23, chromosomes, this, same, pattern, but, not, the, same, number, of, chromosomes, occurs, in, all, organisms, that, utilize, meiosis, meiosis, occurs, in, all, sexually, reproducing, single, celled, and, multicellular, organisms, which, are, all, eukaryotes, including, animals, plants, and, fungi, it, is, an, essential, process, for, oogenesis, and, spermatogenesis, although, the, process, of, meiosis, is, related, to, the, more, general, cell, division, process, of, mitosis, it, differs, in, two, important, respects, usually, occurs, between, identical, sister, chromatids, and, does, not, result, in, genetic, changes, meiosis, begins, with, a, diploid, cell, which, contains, two, copies, of, each, chromosome, termed, homologs, first, the, cell, undergoes, dna, replication, so, each, homolog, now, consists, of, two, identical, sister, chromatids, then, each, set, of, homologs, pair, with, each, other, and, exchange, genetic, information, by, homologous, recombination, often, leading, to, physical, connections, crossovers, between, the, homologs, in, the, first, meiotic, division, the, homologs, are, segregated, to, separate, daughter, cells, by, the, spindle, apparatus, the, cells, then, proceed, to, a, second, division, without, an, intervening, round, of, dna, replication, the, sister, chromatids, are, segregated, to, separate, daughter, cells, to, produce, a, total, of, four, haploid, cells, female, animals, employ, a, slight, variation, on, this, pattern, and, produce, one, large, ovum, and, three, small, polar, bodies, because, of, recombination, an, individual, chromatid, can, consist, of, a, new, combination, of, maternal, and, paternal, genetic, information, resulting, in, offspring, that, are, genetically, distinct, from, either, parent, furthermore, an, individual, gamete, can, include, an, assortment, of, maternal, paternal, and, recombinant, chromatids, this, genetic, diversity, resulting, from, sexual, reproduction, contributes, to, the, variation, in, traits, upon, which, natural, selection, can, act, meiosis, uses, many, of, the, same, mechanisms, as, mitosis, the, type, of, cell, division, used, by, eukaryotes, to, divide, one, cell, into, two, identical, daughter, cells, in, some, plants, fungi, and, protists, meiosis, results, in, the, formation, of, spores, haploid, cells, that, can, divide, vegetatively, without, undergoing, fertilization, some, eukaryotes, like, bdelloid, rotifers, do, not, have, the, ability, to, carry, out, meiosis, and, have, acquired, the, ability, to, reproduce, by, parthenogenesis, meiosis, does, not, occur, in, archaea, or, bacteria, which, generally, reproduce, asexually, via, binary, fission, however, a, sexual, process, known, as, horizontal, gene, transfer, involves, the, transfer, of, dna, from, one, bacterium, or, archaeon, to, another, and, recombination, of, these, dna, molecules, of, different, parental, origin, meiosis, was, discovered, and, described, for, the, first, time, in, sea, urchin, eggs, in, 1876, by, the, german, biologist, oscar, hertwig, it, was, described, again, in, 1883, at, the, level, of, chromosomes, by, the, belgian, zoologist, edouard, van, beneden, in, ascaris, roundworm, eggs, the, significance, of, meiosis, for, reproduction, and, inheritance, however, was, described, only, in, 1890, by, german, biologist, august, weismann, who, noted, that, two, cell, divisions, were, necessary, to, transform, one, diploid, cell, into, four, haploid, cells, if, the, number, of, chromosomes, had, to, be, maintained, in, 1911, the, american, geneticist, thomas, hunt, morgan, detected, crossovers, in, meiosis, in, the, fruit, fly, drosophila, melanogaster, which, helped, to, establish, that, genetic, traits, are, transmitted, on, chromosomes, the, term, meiosis, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, meaning, lessening, it, was, introduced, to, biology, by, j, b, farmer, and, j, e, s, moore, in, 1905, using, the, idiosyncratic, rendering, maiosis, we, propose, to, apply, the, terms, maiosis, or, maiotic, phase, to, cover, the, whole, series, of, nuclear, changes, included, in, the, two, divisions, that, were, designated, as, heterotype, and, homotype, by, flemming, the, spelling, was, changed, to, meiosis, by, koernicke, 1905, and, by, pantel, and, de, sinety, 1906, to, follow, the, usual, conventions, for, transliterating, greek, meiosis, is, divided, into, meiosis, i, and, meiosis, ii, which, are, further, divided, into, karyokinesis, i, cytokinesis, i, karyokinesis, ii, and, cytokinesis, ii, respectively, the, preparatory, steps, that, lead, up, to, meiosis, are, identical, in, pattern, and, name, to, interphase, of, the, mitotic, cell, cycle, interphase, is, divided, into, three, phases, interphase, is, followed, by, meiosis, i, and, then, meiosis, ii, meiosis, i, separates, replicated, homologous, chromosomes, each, still, made, up, of, two, sister, chromatids, into, two, daughter, cells, thus, reducing, the, chromosome, number, by, half, during, meiosis, ii, sister, chromatids, decouple, and, the, resultant, daughter, chromosomes, are, segregated, into, four, daughter, cells, for, diploid, organisms, the, daughter, cells, resulting, from, meiosis, are, haploid, and, contain, only, one, copy, of, each, chromosome, in, some, species, cells, enter, a, resting, phase, known, as, interkinesis, between, meiosis, i, and, meiosis, ii, meiosis, i, and, ii, are, each, divided, into, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and, telophase, stages, similar, in, purpose, to, their, analogous, subphases, in, the, mitotic, cell, cycle, therefore, meiosis, includes, the, stages, of, meiosis, i, prophase, i, metaphase, i, anaphase, i, telophase, i, and, meiosis, ii, prophase, ii, metaphase, ii, anaphase, ii, telophase, ii, during, meiosis, specific, genes, are, more, highly, transcribed, in, addition, to, strong, meiotic, stage, specific, expression, of, mrna, there, are, also, pervasive, translational, controls, e, g, selective, usage, of, preformed, mrna, regulating, the, ultimate, meiotic, stage, specific, protein, expression, of, genes, during, meiosis, thus, both, transcriptional, and, translational, controls, determine, the, broad, restructuring, of, meiotic, cells, needed, to, carry, out, meiosis, meiosis, i, segregates, homologous, chromosomes, which, are, joined, as, tetrads, 2n, 4c, producing, two, haploid, cells, n, chromosomes, 23, in, humans, which, each, contain, chromatid, pairs, 1n, 2c, because, the, ploidy, is, reduced, from, diploid, to, haploid, meiosis, i, is, referred, to, as, a, reductional, division, meiosis, ii, is, an, equational, division, analogous, to, mitosis, in, which, the, sister, chromatids, are, segregated, creating, four, haploid, daughter, cells, 1n, 1c, prophase, i, is, by, far, the, longest, phase, of, meiosis, lasting, 13, out, of, 14, days, in, mice, during, prophase, i, homologous, maternal, and, paternal, chromosomes, pair, synapse, and, exchange, genetic, information, by, homologous, recombination, forming, at, least, one, crossover, per, chromosome, these, crossovers, become, visible, as, chiasmata, plural, singular, chiasma, this, process, facilitates, stable, pairing, between, homologous, chromosomes, and, hence, enables, accurate, segregation, of, the, chromosomes, at, the, first, meiotic, division, the, paired, and, replicated, chromosomes, are, called, bivalents, two, chromosomes, or, tetrads, four, chromatids, with, one, chromosome, coming, from, each, parent, prophase, i, is, divided, into, a, series, of, substages, which, are, named, according, to, the, appearance, of, chromosomes, the, first, stage, of, prophase, i, is, the, leptotene, stage, also, known, as, leptonema, from, greek, words, meaning, thin, threads, 27, in, this, stage, of, prophase, i, individual, chromosomes, each, consisting, of, two, replicated, sister, chromatids, become, individualized, to, form, visible, strands, within, the, nucleus, 27, 353, the, chromosomes, each, form, a, linear, array, of, loops, mediated, by, cohesin, and, the, lateral, elements, of, the, synaptonemal, complex, assemble, forming, an, axial, element, from, which, the, loops, emanate, recombination, is, initiated, in, this, stage, by, the, enzyme, spo11, which, creates, programmed, double, strand, breaks, around, 300, per, meiosis, in, mice, this, process, generates, single, stranded, dna, filaments, coated, by, rad51, and, dmc1, which, invade, the, homologous, chromosomes, forming, inter, axis, bridges, and, resulting, in, the, pairing, co, alignment, of, homologues, to, a, distance, of, 400, nm, in, mice, leptotene, is, followed, by, the, zygotene, stage, also, known, as, zygonema, from, greek, words, meaning, paired, threads, 27, which, in, some, organisms, is, also, called, the, bouquet, stage, because, of, the, way, the, telomeres, cluster, at, one, end, of, the, nucleus, in, this, stage, the, homologous, chromosomes, become, much, more, closely, 100, nm, and, stably, paired, a, process, called, synapsis, mediated, by, the, installation, of, the, transverse, and, central, elements, of, the, synaptonemal, complex, synapsis, is, thought, to, occur, in, a, zipper, like, fashion, starting, from, a, recombination, nodule, the, paired, chromosomes, are, called, bivalent, or, tetrad, chromosomes, the, pachytene, stage, p, k, t, i, n, pak, i, teen, also, known, as, pachynema, from, greek, words, meaning, thick, threads, 27, is, the, stage, at, which, all, autosomal, chromosomes, have, synapsed, in, this, stage, homologous, recombination, including, chromosomal, crossover, crossing, over, is, completed, through, the, repair, of, the, double, strand, breaks, formed, in, leptotene, most, breaks, are, repaired, without, forming, crossovers, resulting, in, gene, conversion, however, a, subset, of, breaks, at, least, one, per, chromosome, form, crossovers, between, non, sister, homologous, chromosomes, resulting, in, the, exchange, of, genetic, information, the, exchange, of, information, between, the, homologous, chromatids, results, in, a, recombination, of, information, each, chromosome, has, the, complete, set, of, information, it, had, before, and, there, are, no, gaps, formed, as, a, result, of, the, process, because, the, chromosomes, cannot, be, distinguished, in, the, synaptonemal, complex, the, actual, act, of, crossing, over, is, not, perceivable, through, an, ordinary, light, microscope, and, chiasmata, are, not, visible, until, the, next, stage, during, the, diplotene, stage, also, known, as, diplonema, from, greek, words, meaning, two, threads, 30, the, synaptonemal, complex, disassembles, and, homologous, chromosomes, separate, from, one, another, a, little, however, the, homologous, chromosomes, of, each, bivalent, remain, tightly, bound, at, chiasmata, the, regions, where, crossing, over, occurred, the, chiasmata, remain, on, the, chromosomes, until, they, are, severed, at, the, transition, to, anaphase, i, to, allow, homologous, chromosomes, to, move, to, opposite, poles, of, the, cell, in, human, fetal, oogenesis, all, developing, oocytes, develop, to, this, stage, and, are, arrested, in, prophase, i, before, birth, this, suspended, state, is, referred, to, as, the, dictyotene, stage, or, dictyate, it, lasts, until, meiosis, is, resumed, to, prepare, the, oocyte, for, ovulation, which, happens, at, puberty, or, even, later, chromosomes, condense, further, during, the, diakinesis, stage, from, greek, words, meaning, moving, through, 30, this, is, the, first, point, in, meiosis, where, the, four, parts, of, the, tetrads, are, actually, visible, sites, of, crossing, over, entangle, together, effectively, overlapping, making, chiasmata, clearly, visible, other, than, this, observation, the, rest, of, the, stage, closely, resembles, prometaphase, of, mitosis, the, nucleoli, disappear, the, nuclear, membrane, disintegrates, into, vesicles, and, the, meiotic, spindle, begins, to, form, unlike, mitotic, cells, human, and, mouse, oocytes, do, not, have, centrosomes, to, produce, the, meiotic, spindle, in, mice, approximately, 80, microtubule, organizing, centers, mtocs, form, a, sphere, in, the, ooplasm, and, begin, to, nucleate, microtubules, that, reach, out, towards, chromosomes, attaching, to, the, chromosomes, at, the, kinetochore, over, time, the, mtocs, merge, until, two, poles, have, formed, generating, a, barrel, shaped, spindle, in, human, oocytes, spindle, microtubule, nucleation, begins, on, the, chromosomes, forming, an, aster, that, eventually, expands, to, surround, the, chromosomes, chromosomes, then, slide, along, the, microtubules, towards, the, equator, of, the, spindle, at, which, point, the, chromosome, kinetochores, form, end, on, attachments, to, microtubules, homologous, pairs, move, together, along, the, metaphase, plate, as, kinetochore, microtubules, from, both, spindle, poles, attach, to, their, respective, kinetochores, the, paired, homologous, chromosomes, align, along, an, equatorial, plane, that, bisects, the, spindle, due, to, continuous, counterbalancing, forces, exerted, on, the, bivalents, by, the, microtubules, emanating, from, the, two, kinetochores, of, homologous, chromosomes, this, attachment, is, referred, to, as, a, bipolar, attachment, the, physical, basis, of, the, independent, assortment, of, chromosomes, is, the, random, orientation, of, each, bivalent, along, with, the, metaphase, plate, with, respect, to, the, orientation, of, the, other, bivalents, along, the, same, equatorial, line, the, protein, complex, cohesin, holds, sister, chromatids, together, from, the, time, of, their, replication, until, anaphase, in, mitosis, the, force, of, kinetochore, microtubules, pulling, in, opposite, directions, creates, tension, the, cell, senses, this, tension, and, does, not, progress, with, anaphase, until, all, the, chromosomes, are, properly, bi, oriented, in, meiosis, establishing, tension, ordinarily, requires, at, least, one, crossover, per, chromosome, pair, in, addition, to, cohesin, between, sister, chromatids, see, chromosome, segregation, kinetochore, microtubules, shorten, pulling, homologous, chromosomes, which, each, consist, of, a, pair, of, sister, chromatids, to, opposite, poles, nonkinetochore, microtubules, lengthen, pushing, the, centrosomes, farther, apart, the, cell, elongates, in, preparation, for, division, down, the, center, unlike, in, mitosis, only, the, cohesin, from, the, chromosome, arms, is, degraded, while, the, cohesin, surrounding, the, centromere, remains, protected, by, a, protein, named, shugoshin, japanese, for, guardian, spirit, what, prevents, the, sister, chromatids, from, separating, this, allows, the, sister, chromatids, to, remain, together, while, homologs, are, segregated, the, first, meiotic, division, effectively, ends, when, the, chromosomes, arrive, at, the, poles, each, daughter, cell, now, has, half, the, number, of, chromosomes, but, each, chromosome, consists, of, a, pair, of, chromatids, the, microtubules, that, make, up, the, spindle, network, disappear, and, a, new, nuclear, membrane, surrounds, each, haploid, set, cytokinesis, the, pinching, of, the, cell, membrane, in, animal, cells, or, the, formation, of, the, cell, wall, in, plant, cells, occurs, completing, the, creation, of, two, daughter, cells, however, cytokinesis, does, not, fully, complete, resulting, in, cytoplasmic, bridges, which, enable, the, cytoplasm, to, be, shared, between, daughter, cells, until, the, end, of, meiosis, ii, sister, chromatids, remain, attached, during, telophase, i, cells, may, enter, a, period, of, rest, known, as, interkinesis, or, interphase, ii, no, dna, replication, occurs, during, this, stage, meiosis, ii, is, the, second, meiotic, division, and, usually, involves, equational, segregation, or, separation, of, sister, chromatids, mechanically, the, process, is, similar, to, mitosis, though, its, genetic, results, are, fundamentally, different, the, result, is, the, production, of, four, haploid, cells, n, chromosomes, 23, in, humans, from, the, two, haploid, cells, with, n, chromosomes, each, consisting, of, two, sister, chromatids, produced, in, meiosis, i, the, four, main, steps, of, meiosis, ii, are, prophase, ii, metaphase, ii, anaphase, ii, and, telophase, ii, in, prophase, ii, we, see, the, disappearance, of, the, nucleoli, and, the, nuclear, envelope, again, as, well, as, the, shortening, and, thickening, of, the, chromatids, centrosomes, move, to, the, polar, regions, and, arrange, spindle, fibers, for, the, second, meiotic, division, in, metaphase, ii, the, centromeres, contain, two, kinetochores, that, attach, to, spindle, fibers, from, the, centrosomes, at, opposite, poles, the, new, equatorial, metaphase, plate, is, rotated, by, 90, degrees, when, compared, to, meiosis, i, perpendicular, to, the, previous, plate, this, is, followed, by, anaphase, ii, in, which, the, remaining, centromeric, cohesin, not, protected, by, shugoshin, anymore, is, cleaved, allowing, the, sister, chromatids, to, segregate, the, sister, chromatids, by, convention, are, now, called, sister, chromosomes, as, they, move, toward, opposing, poles, the, process, ends, with, telophase, ii, which, is, similar, to, telophase, i, and, is, marked, by, decondensation, and, lengthening, of, the, chromosomes, and, the, disassembly, of, the, spindle, nuclear, envelopes, re, form, and, cleavage, or, cell, plate, formation, eventually, produces, a, total, of, four, daughter, cells, each, with, a, haploid, set, of, chromosomes, meiosis, is, now, complete, and, ends, up, with, four, new, daughter, cells, meiosis, appears, to, be, a, fundamental, characteristic, of, eukaryotic, organisms, and, to, have, been, present, early, in, eukaryotic, evolution, eukaryotes, that, were, once, thought, to, lack, meiotic, sex, have, recently, been, shown, to, likely, have, or, once, have, had, this, capability, as, one, example, giardia, intestinalis, a, common, intestinal, parasite, was, previously, considered, to, have, descended, from, a, lineage, that, predated, the, emergence, of, meiosis, and, sex, however, g, intestinalis, has, now, been, found, to, possess, a, core, set, of, meiotic, genes, including, five, meiosis, specific, genes, also, evidence, for, meiotic, recombination, indicative, of, sexual, reproduction, was, found, in, g, intestinalis, another, example, of, organisms, previously, thought, to, be, asexual, are, parasitic, protozoa, of, the, genus, leishmania, which, cause, human, disease, however, these, organisms, were, shown, to, have, a, sexual, cycle, consistent, with, a, meiotic, process, although, amoeba, were, once, generally, regarded, as, asexual, evidence, has, been, presented, that, most, lineages, are, anciently, sexual, and, that, the, majority, of, asexual, groups, probably, arose, recently, and, independently, dacks, and, rogers, proposed, based, on, a, phylogenetic, analysis, that, facultative, sex, was, likely, present, in, the, common, ancestor, of, eukaryotes, the, new, combinations, of, dna, created, during, meiosis, are, a, significant, source, of, genetic, variation, alongside, mutation, resulting, in, new, combinations, of, alleles, which, may, be, beneficial, meiosis, generates, gamete, genetic, diversity, in, two, ways, 1, law, of, independent, assortment, the, independent, orientation, of, homologous, chromosome, pairs, along, the, metaphase, plate, during, metaphase, i, and, orientation, of, sister, chromatids, in, metaphase, ii, this, is, the, subsequent, separation, of, homologs, and, sister, chromatids, during, anaphase, i, and, ii, it, allows, a, random, and, independent, distribution, of, chromosomes, to, each, daughter, cell, and, ultimately, to, gametes, and, 2, crossing, over, the, physical, exchange, of, homologous, chromosomal, regions, by, homologous, recombination, during, prophase, i, results, in, new, combinations, of, genetic, information, within, chromosomes, however, such, physical, exchange, does, not, always, occur, during, meiosis, in, the, oocytes, of, the, silkworm, bombyx, mori, meiosis, is, completely, achiasmate, lacking, crossovers, although, synaptonemal, complexes, are, present, during, the, pachytene, stage, of, meiosis, in, b, mori, crossing, over, homologous, recombination, is, absent, between, the, paired, chromosomes, female, mammals, and, birds, are, born, possessing, all, the, oocytes, needed, for, future, ovulations, and, these, oocytes, are, arrested, at, the, prophase, i, stage, of, meiosis, in, humans, as, an, example, oocytes, are, formed, between, three, and, four, months, of, gestation, within, the, fetus, and, are, therefore, present, at, birth, during, this, prophase, i, arrested, stage, dictyate, which, may, last, for, decades, four, copies, of, the, genome, are, present, in, the, oocytes, the, arrest, of, ooctyes, at, the, four, genome, copy, stage, was, proposed, to, provide, the, informational, redundancy, needed, to, repair, damage, in, the, dna, of, the, germline, the, repair, process, used, appears, to, involve, homologous, recombinational, repair, prophase, i, arrested, oocytes, have, a, high, capability, for, efficient, repair, of, dna, damage, particularly, exogenously, induced, double, strand, breaks, dna, repair, capability, appears, to, be, a, key, quality, control, mechanism, in, the, female, germ, line, and, a, critical, determinant, of, fertility, genetic, recombination, can, be, viewed, as, fundamentally, a, dna, repair, process, and, that, when, it, occurs, during, meiosis, it, is, an, adaptation, for, repairing, the, genomic, dna, that, is, passed, on, to, progeny, experimental, findings, indicate, that, a, substantial, benefit, of, meiosis, is, recombinational, repair, of, dna, damage, in, the, germline, as, indicated, by, the, following, examples, hydrogen, peroxide, is, an, agent, that, causes, oxidative, stress, leading, to, oxidative, dna, damage, treatment, of, the, yeast, schizosaccharomyces, pombe, with, hydrogen, peroxide, increased, the, frequency, of, mating, and, the, formation, of, meiotic, spores, by, 4, to, 18, fold, volvox, carteri, a, haploid, multicellular, facultatively, sexual, green, algae, can, be, induced, by, heat, shock, to, reproduce, by, meiotic, sex, this, induction, can, be, inhibited, by, antioxidants, indicating, that, the, induction, of, meiotic, sex, by, heat, shock, is, likely, mediated, by, oxidative, stress, leading, to, increased, dna, damage, meiosis, occurs, in, eukaryotic, life, cycles, involving, sexual, reproduction, consisting, of, the, cyclical, process, of, growth, and, development, by, mitotic, cell, division, production, of, gametes, by, meiosis, and, fertilization, at, certain, stages, of, the, life, cycle, germ, cells, produce, gametes, somatic, cells, make, up, the, body, of, the, organism, and, are, not, involved, in, gamete, production, cycling, meiosis, and, fertilization, events, results, in, alternation, between, haploid, and, diploid, states, the, organism, phase, of, the, life, cycle, can, occur, either, during, the, diploid, state, diplontic, life, cycle, during, the, haploid, state, haplontic, life, cycle, or, both, haplodiplontic, life, cycle, in, which, there, are, two, distinct, organism, phases, one, with, haploid, cells, and, the, other, with, diploid, cells, in, the, diplontic, life, cycle, with, pre, gametic, meiosis, as, in, humans, the, organism, is, multicellular, and, diploid, grown, by, mitosis, from, a, diploid, cell, called, the, zygote, the, organism, s, diploid, germ, line, stem, cells, undergo, meiosis, to, make, haploid, gametes, the, spermatozoa, in, males, and, ova, in, females, which, fertilize, to, form, the, zygote, the, diploid, zygote, undergoes, repeated, cellular, division, by, mitosis, to, grow, into, the, organism, in, the, haplontic, life, cycle, with, post, zygotic, meiosis, the, organism, is, haploid, by, the, proliferation, and, differentiation, of, a, single, haploid, cell, called, the, gamete, two, organisms, of, opposing, sex, contribute, their, haploid, gametes, to, form, a, diploid, zygote, the, zygote, undergoes, meiosis, immediately, creating, four, haploid, cells, these, cells, undergo, mitosis, to, create, the, organism, many, fungi, and, many, protozoa, utilize, the, haplontic, life, cycle, in, the, haplodiplontic, life, cycle, with, sporic, or, intermediate, meiosis, the, living, organism, alternates, between, haploid, and, diploid, states, consequently, this, cycle, is, also, known, as, the, alternation, of, generations, the, diploid, organism, s, germ, line, cells, undergo, meiosis, to, produce, spores, the, spores, proliferate, by, mitosis, growing, into, a, haploid, organism, the, haploid, organism, s, gamete, then, combines, with, another, haploid, organism, s, gamete, creating, the, zygote, the, zygote, undergoes, repeated, mitosis, and, differentiation, to, produce, a, new, diploid, organism, the, haplodiplontic, life, cycle, can, be, considered, a, fusion, of, the, diplontic, and, haplontic, life, cycles, meiosis, occurs, in, all, animals, and, plants, the, result, the, production, of, gametes, with, half, the, number, of, chromosomes, as, the, parent, cell, is, the, same, but, the, detailed, process, is, different, in, animals, meiosis, produces, gametes, directly, in, land, plants, and, some, algae, there, is, an, alternation, of, generations, such, that, meiosis, in, the, diploid, sporophyte, generation, produces, haploid, spores, instead, of, gametes, when, they, germinate, these, spores, undergo, repeated, cell, division, by, mitosis, developing, into, a, multicellular, haploid, gametophyte, generation, which, then, produces, gametes, directly, i, e, without, further, meiosis, in, both, animals, and, plants, the, final, stage, is, for, the, gametes, to, fuse, to, form, a, zygote, in, which, the, original, number, of, chromosomes, is, restored, in, females, meiosis, occurs, in, cells, known, as, oocytes, singular, oocyte, each, primary, oocyte, divides, twice, in, meiosis, unequally, in, each, case, the, first, division, produces, a, daughter, cell, and, a, much, smaller, polar, body, which, may, or, may, not, undergo, a, second, division, in, meiosis, ii, division, of, the, daughter, cell, produces, a, second, polar, body, and, a, single, haploid, cell, which, enlarges, to, become, an, ovum, therefore, in, females, each, primary, oocyte, that, undergoes, meiosis, results, in, one, mature, ovum, and, two, or, three, polar, bodies, there, are, pauses, during, meiosis, in, females, maturing, oocytes, are, arrested, in, prophase, i, of, meiosis, i, and, lie, dormant, within, a, protective, shell, of, somatic, cells, called, the, follicle, at, the, beginning, of, each, menstrual, cycle, fsh, secretion, from, the, anterior, pituitary, stimulates, a, few, follicles, to, mature, in, a, process, known, as, folliculogenesis, during, this, process, the, maturing, oocytes, resume, meiosis, and, continue, until, metaphase, ii, of, meiosis, ii, where, they, are, again, arrested, just, before, ovulation, if, these, oocytes, are, fertilized, by, sperm, they, will, resume, and, complete, meiosis, during, folliculogenesis, in, humans, usually, one, follicle, becomes, dominant, while, the, others, undergo, atresia, the, process, of, meiosis, in, females, occurs, during, oogenesis, and, differs, from, the, typical, meiosis, in, that, it, features, a, long, period, of, meiotic, arrest, known, as, the, dictyate, stage, and, lacks, the, assistance, of, centrosomes, in, males, meiosis, occurs, during, spermatogenesis, in, the, seminiferous, tubules, of, the, testicles, meiosis, during, spermatogenesis, is, specific, to, a, type, of, cell, called, spermatocytes, which, will, later, mature, to, become, spermatozoa, meiosis, of, primordial, germ, cells, happens, at, the, time, of, puberty, much, later, than, in, females, tissues, of, the, male, testis, suppress, meiosis, by, degrading, retinoic, acid, proposed, to, be, a, stimulator, of, meiosis, this, is, overcome, at, puberty, when, cells, within, seminiferous, tubules, called, sertoli, cells, start, making, their, own, retinoic, acid, sensitivity, to, retinoic, acid, is, also, adjusted, by, proteins, called, nanos, and, dazl, genetic, loss, of, function, studies, on, retinoic, acid, generating, enzymes, have, shown, that, retinoic, acid, is, required, postnatally, to, stimulate, spermatogonia, differentiation, which, results, several, days, later, in, spermatocytes, undergoing, meiosis, however, retinoic, acid, is, not, required, during, the, time, when, meiosis, initiates, in, female, mammals, meiosis, begins, immediately, after, primordial, germ, cells, migrate, to, the, ovary, in, the, embryo, some, studies, suggest, that, retinoic, acid, derived, from, the, primitive, kidney, mesonephros, stimulates, meiosis, in, embryonic, ovarian, oogonia, and, that, tissues, of, the, embryonic, male, testis, suppress, meiosis, by, degrading, retinoic, acid, however, genetic, loss, of, function, studies, on, retinoic, acid, generating, enzymes, have, shown, that, retinoic, acid, is, not, required, for, initiation, of, either, female, meiosis, which, occurs, during, embryogenesis, or, male, meiosis, which, initiates, postnatally, while, the, majority, of, eukaryotes, have, a, two, divisional, meiosis, though, sometimes, achiasmatic, a, very, rare, form, one, divisional, meiosis, occurs, in, some, flagellates, parabasalids, and, oxymonads, from, the, gut, of, the, wood, feeding, cockroach, cryptocercus, recombination, among, the, 23, pairs, of, human, chromosomes, is, responsible, for, redistributing, not, just, the, actual, chromosomes, but, also, pieces, of, each, of, them, there, is, also, an, estimated, 1, 6, fold, more, recombination, in, females, relative, to, males, in, addition, average, female, recombination, is, higher, at, the, centromeres, and, male, recombination, is, higher, at, the, telomeres, on, average, 1, million, bp, 1, mb, correspond, to, 1, cmorgan, cm, 1, recombination, frequency, the, frequency, of, cross, overs, remain, uncertain, in, yeast, mouse, and, human, it, has, been, estimated, that, 200, double, strand, breaks, dsbs, are, formed, per, meiotic, cell, however, only, a, subset, of, dsbs, 5, 30, depending, on, the, organism, go, on, to, produce, crossovers, which, would, result, in, only, 1, 2, cross, overs, per, human, chromosome, the, normal, separation, of, chromosomes, in, meiosis, i, or, sister, chromatids, in, meiosis, ii, is, termed, disjunction, when, the, segregation, is, not, normal, it, is, called, nondisjunction, this, results, in, the, production, of, gametes, which, have, either, too, many, or, too, few, of, a, particular, chromosome, and, is, a, common, mechanism, for, trisomy, or, monosomy, nondisjunction, can, occur, in, the, meiosis, i, or, meiosis, ii, phases, of, cellular, reproduction, or, during, mitosis, most, monosomic, and, trisomic, human, embryos, are, not, viable, but, some, aneuploidies, can, be, tolerated, such, as, trisomy, for, the, smallest, chromosome, chromosome, 21, phenotypes, of, these, aneuploidies, range, from, severe, developmental, disorders, to, asymptomatic, medical, conditions, include, but, are, not, limited, to, the, probability, of, nondisjunction, in, human, oocytes, increases, with, increasing, maternal, age, presumably, due, to, loss, of, cohesin, over, time, in, order, to, understand, meiosis, a, comparison, to, mitosis, is, helpful, the, table, below, shows, the, differences, between, meiosis, and, mitosis, how, a, cell, proceeds, to, meiotic, division, in, meiotic, cell, division, is, not, well, known, maturation, promoting, factor, mpf, seemingly, have, role, in, frog, oocyte, meiosis, in, the, fungus, s, pombe, there, is, a, role, of, meirna, binding, protein, for, entry, to, meiotic, cell, division, it, has, been, suggested, that, yeast, cep1, gene, product, that, binds, centromeric, region, cde1, may, play, a, role, in, chromosome, pairing, during, meiosis, i, meiotic, recombination, is, mediated, through, double, stranded, break, which, is, catalyzed, by, spo11, protein, also, mre11, sae2, and, exo1, play, role, in, breakage, and, recombination, after, the, breakage, happen, recombination, take, place, which, is, typically, homologous, the, recombination, may, go, through, either, a, double, holliday, junction, dhj, pathway, or, synthesis, dependent, strand, annealing, sdsa, the, second, one, gives, to, noncrossover, product, seemingly, there, are, checkpoints, for, meiotic, cell, division, too, in, s, pombe, rad, proteins, s, pombe, mek1, with, fha, kinase, domain, cdc25, cdc2, and, unknown, factor, is, thought, to, form, a, checkpoint, in, vertebrate, oogenesis, maintained, by, cytostatic, factor, csf, has, role, in, switching, into,
