palliative, care, derived, from, the, latin, root, palliare, or, to, cloak, is, an, interdisciplinary, medical, caregiving, approach, aimed, at, optimizing, quality, of, life, and, mitigating, suffering, among, people, with, serious, complex, and, often, terminal, illnesses, within, the, published, literature, many, definitions, of, palliative, care, exist, the, world, health, organization, who, describes, palliative, care, as, an, approach, that, improves, the, quality, of, life, of, patients, and, their, families, facing, the, problems, associated, with, life, threatening, illness, through, the, prevention, and, relief, of, suffering, by, means, of, early, identification, and, impeccable, assessment, and, treatment, of, pain, illnesses, including, other, problems, whether, physical, psychosocial, and, spiritual, in, the, past, palliative, care, was, a, disease, specific, approach, but, today, the, who, takes, a, broader, patient, centered, approach, that, suggests, that, the, principles, of, palliative, care, should, be, applied, as, early, as, possible, to, any, chronic, and, ultimately, fatal, illness, this, shift, was, important, because, if, a, disease, oriented, approach, is, followed, the, needs, and, preferences, of, the, patient, are, not, fully, met, and, aspects, of, care, such, as, pain, quality, of, life, and, social, support, as, well, as, spiritual, and, emotional, needs, fail, to, be, addressed, rather, a, patient, centered, model, prioritizes, relief, of, suffering, and, tailors, care, to, increase, the, quality, of, life, for, terminally, ill, patients, palliative, care, is, appropriate, for, individuals, with, serious, illnesses, across, the, age, spectrum, and, can, be, provided, as, the, main, goal, of, care, or, in, tandem, with, curative, treatment, it, is, provided, by, an, interdisciplinary, team, which, can, include, physicians, nurses, occupational, and, physical, therapists, psychologists, social, workers, chaplains, and, dietitians, palliative, care, can, be, provided, in, a, variety, of, contexts, including, hospitals, outpatient, skilled, nursing, and, home, settings, although, an, important, part, of, end, of, life, care, palliative, care, is, not, limited, to, individuals, near, the, end, of, life, evidence, supports, the, efficacy, of, a, palliative, care, approach, in, improvement, of, a, person, s, quality, of, life, palliative, care, s, main, focus, is, to, improve, the, quality, of, life, for, those, with, chronic, illnesses, it, is, commonly, the, case, that, palliative, care, is, provided, at, the, end, of, life, but, it, can, be, helpful, for, a, person, of, any, stage, of, illness, that, is, critical, or, any, age, palliative, care, is, able, to, improve, healthcare, quality, in, three, sectors, physical, and, emotional, relief, strengthening, of, patient, physician, communication, and, decision, making, and, coordinated, continuity, of, care, across, various, healthcare, settings, including, hospital, home, and, hospice, the, overall, goal, of, palliative, care, is, to, improve, quality, of, life, of, individuals, with, serious, illness, any, life, threatening, condition, which, either, reduces, an, individual, s, daily, function, or, quality, of, life, or, increases, caregiver, burden, through, pain, and, symptom, management, identification, and, support, of, caregiver, needs, and, care, coordination, palliative, care, can, be, delivered, at, any, stage, of, illness, alongside, other, treatments, with, curative, or, life, prolonging, intent, and, is, not, restricted, to, people, receiving, end, of, life, care, historically, palliative, care, services, were, focused, on, individuals, with, incurable, cancer, but, this, framework, is, now, applied, to, other, diseases, including, severe, heart, failure, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, multiple, sclerosis, and, other, neurodegenerative, conditions, forty, million, people, each, year, are, expected, to, need, palliative, care, with, approximately, 78, of, this, population, living, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, however, only, 14, of, this, population, is, able, to, receive, this, kind, of, care, with, a, majority, in, high, income, countries, making, this, an, important, sector, to, pay, attention, to, palliative, care, can, be, initiated, in, a, variety, of, care, settings, including, emergency, rooms, hospitals, hospice, facilities, or, at, home, for, some, severe, disease, processes, medical, specialty, professional, organizations, recommend, initiating, palliative, care, at, the, time, of, diagnosis, or, when, disease, directed, options, would, not, improve, a, patient, s, prognosis, for, example, the, american, society, of, clinical, oncology, recommends, that, patients, with, advanced, cancer, should, be, referred, to, interdisciplinary, palliative, care, teams, that, provide, inpatient, and, outpatient, care, early, in, the, course, of, disease, alongside, active, treatment, of, their, cancer, within, eight, weeks, of, diagnosis, appropriately, engaging, palliative, care, providers, as, a, part, of, patient, care, improves, overall, symptom, control, quality, of, life, and, family, satisfaction, of, care, while, reducing, overall, healthcare, costs, the, distinction, between, palliative, care, and, hospice, differs, depending, on, global, context, in, the, united, states, the, term, hospice, refers, specifically, to, a, benefit, provided, by, the, federal, government, since, 1982, hospice, care, services, and, palliative, care, programs, share, similar, goals, of, mitigating, unpleasant, symptoms, controlling, pain, optimizing, comfort, and, addressing, psychological, distress, hospice, care, focuses, on, comfort, and, psychological, support, and, curative, therapies, are, not, pursued, under, the, medicare, hospice, benefit, individuals, certified, by, two, physicians, to, have, less, than, six, months, to, live, assuming, a, typical, course, have, access, to, specialized, hospice, services, through, various, insurance, programs, medicare, medicaid, and, most, health, maintenance, organizations, and, private, insurers, an, individual, s, hospice, benefits, are, not, revoked, if, that, individual, lives, beyond, a, six, month, period, in, the, united, states, in, order, to, be, eligible, for, hospice, patients, usually, forego, treatments, aimed, at, cure, unless, they, are, minors, this, is, to, avoid, what, is, called, concurrent, care, where, two, different, clinicians, are, billing, for, the, same, service, in, 2016, a, movement, began, to, extend, the, reach, of, concurrent, care, to, adults, who, were, eligible, for, hospice, but, not, yet, emotionally, prepared, to, forego, curative, treatments, outside, the, united, states, the, term, hospice, usually, refers, to, a, building, or, institution, that, specializes, in, palliative, care, these, institutions, provide, care, to, patients, with, end, of, life, and, palliative, care, needs, in, the, common, vernacular, outside, the, united, states, hospice, care, and, palliative, care, are, synonymous, and, are, not, contingent, on, different, avenues, of, funding, over, 40, of, all, dying, patients, in, the, united, states, currently, undergo, hospice, care, most, of, the, hospice, care, occurs, at, a, home, environment, during, the, last, weeks, months, of, their, lives, of, those, patients, 86, 6, believe, their, care, is, excellent, hospice, s, philosophy, is, that, death, is, a, part, of, life, so, it, is, personal, and, unique, caregivers, are, encouraged, to, discuss, death, with, the, patients, and, encourage, spiritual, exploration, if, they, so, wish, the, field, of, palliative, care, grew, out, of, the, hospice, movement, which, is, commonly, associated, with, dame, cicely, saunders, who, founded, st, christopher, s, hospice, for, the, terminally, ill, in, 1967, and, elisabeth, k, bler, ross, who, published, her, seminal, work, on, death, and, dying, in, 1969, in, 1974, balfour, mount, coined, the, term, palliative, care, and, paul, henteleff, became, the, director, of, a, new, terminal, care, unit, at, saint, boniface, hospital, in, winnipeg, in, 1987, declan, walsh, established, a, palliative, medicine, service, at, the, cleveland, clinic, cancer, center, in, ohio, which, later, expanded, to, become, the, training, site, of, the, first, palliative, care, clinical, and, research, fellowship, as, well, as, the, first, acute, pain, and, palliative, care, inpatient, unit, in, the, united, states, the, program, evolved, into, the, harry, r, horvitz, center, for, palliative, medicine, which, was, designated, as, an, international, demonstration, project, by, the, world, health, organization, and, accredited, by, the, european, society, for, medical, oncology, as, an, integrated, center, of, oncology, and, palliative, care, advances, in, palliative, care, have, since, inspired, a, dramatic, increase, in, hospital, based, palliative, care, programs, notable, research, outcomes, forwarding, the, implementation, of, palliative, care, programs, include, over, 90, of, us, hospitals, with, more, than, 300, beds, have, palliative, care, teams, yet, only, 17, of, rural, hospitals, with, 50, or, more, beds, have, palliative, care, teams, hospice, and, palliative, medicine, has, been, a, board, certified, sub, specialty, of, medicine, in, the, united, states, since, 2006, additionally, in, 2011, the, joint, commission, began, an, advanced, certification, program, for, palliative, care, that, recognizes, hospital, inpatient, programs, demonstrating, outstanding, care, and, enhancement, of, the, quality, of, life, for, people, with, serious, illness, medications, used, in, palliative, care, can, be, common, medications, but, used, for, a, different, indication, based, on, established, practices, with, varying, degrees, of, evidence, examples, include, the, use, of, antipsychotic, medications, anticonvulsants, and, morphine, routes, of, administration, may, differ, from, acute, or, chronic, care, as, many, people, in, palliative, care, lose, the, ability, to, swallow, a, common, alternative, route, of, administration, is, subcutaneous, as, it, is, less, traumatic, and, less, difficult, to, maintain, than, intravenous, medications, other, routes, of, administration, include, sublingual, intramuscular, and, transdermal, medications, are, often, managed, at, home, by, family, or, nursing, support, palliative, care, interventions, in, care, homes, may, contribute, to, lower, discomfort, for, residents, with, dementia, and, to, improve, family, members, views, of, the, quality, of, care, however, higher, quality, research, is, needed, to, support, the, benefits, of, these, interventions, for, older, people, dying, in, these, facilities, high, certainty, evidence, supports, the, finding, that, implementation, of, home, based, end, of, life, care, programs, may, increase, the, number, of, adults, who, will, die, at, home, and, slightly, improve, patient, satisfaction, at, a, one, month, follow, up, the, impact, of, home, based, end, of, life, care, on, caregivers, healthcare, staff, and, health, service, costs, are, uncertain, for, many, patients, end, of, life, care, can, cause, emotional, and, psychological, distress, contributing, to, their, total, suffering, an, interdisciplinary, palliative, care, team, consisting, of, a, mental, health, professional, social, worker, counselor, as, well, as, spiritual, support, such, as, a, chaplain, can, play, important, roles, in, helping, people, and, their, families, cope, using, various, methods, such, as, counseling, visualization, cognitive, methods, drug, therapy, and, relaxation, therapy, to, address, their, needs, palliative, pets, can, play, a, role, in, this, last, category, total, pain, in, the, 1960s, hospice, pioneer, cicely, saunders, first, introduced, the, term, total, pain, to, describe, the, heterogenous, nature, of, pain, this, is, the, idea, that, a, patient, s, experience, of, total, pain, has, distinctive, roots, in, the, physical, psychological, social, and, spiritual, realm, but, that, they, are, all, still, closely, linked, to, one, another, identifying, the, cause, of, pain, can, help, guide, care, for, some, patients, and, impact, their, quality, of, life, overall, physical, pain, can, be, managed, using, pain, medications, as, long, as, they, do, not, put, the, patient, at, further, risk, for, developing, or, increasing, medical, diagnoses, such, as, heart, problems, or, difficulty, breathing, patients, at, the, end, of, life, can, exhibit, many, physical, symptoms, that, can, cause, extreme, pain, such, as, dyspnea, or, difficulty, breathing, coughing, xerostomia, dry, mouth, nausea, and, vomiting, constipation, fever, delirium, and, excessive, oral, and, pharyngeal, secretions, death, rattle, radiation, is, commonly, used, with, palliative, intent, to, alleviate, pain, in, patients, with, cancer, as, an, effect, from, radiation, may, take, days, to, weeks, to, occur, patients, dying, a, short, time, following, their, treatment, are, unlikely, to, receive, benefit, once, the, immediate, physical, pain, has, been, dealt, with, it, is, important, to, remember, to, be, a, compassionate, and, empathetic, caregiver, that, is, there, to, listen, and, be, there, for, their, patients, being, able, to, identify, the, distressing, factors, in, their, life, other, than, the, pain, can, help, them, be, more, comfortable, when, a, patient, has, their, needs, met, then, they, are, more, likely, to, be, open, to, the, idea, of, hospice, or, treatments, outside, comfort, care, having, a, psychosocial, assessment, allows, the, medical, team, to, help, facilitate, a, healthy, patient, family, understanding, of, adjustment, coping, and, support, this, communication, between, the, medical, team, and, the, patients, and, family, can, also, help, facilitate, discussions, on, the, process, of, maintaining, and, enhancing, relationships, finding, meaning, in, the, dying, process, and, achieving, a, sense, of, control, while, confronting, and, preparing, for, death, for, adults, with, anxiety, medical, evidence, in, the, form, of, high, quality, randomized, trials, is, insufficient, to, determine, the, most, effective, treatment, approach, to, reduce, the, symptoms, of, anxiety, spirituality, is, a, fundamental, component, of, palliative, care, moreover, hospices, where, palliative, care, is, administered, have, usually, available, chaplains, according, to, the, clinical, practice, guidelines, for, quality, palliative, care, spirituality, is, a, dynamic, and, intrinsic, aspect, of, humanity, and, has, been, associated, with, an, improved, quality, of, life, for, those, with, chronic, and, serious, illness, especially, for, patients, who, are, living, with, incurable, and, advanced, illnesses, of, a, chronic, nature, spiritual, beliefs, and, practices, can, influence, perceptions, of, pain, and, distress, as, well, as, quality, of, life, among, advanced, cancer, patients, spiritual, needs, are, often, described, in, literature, as, including, loving, being, loved, forgiveness, and, deciphering, the, meaning, of, life, most, spiritual, interventions, are, subjective, and, complex, many, have, not, been, well, evaluated, for, their, effectiveness, however, tools, can, be, used, to, measure, and, implement, effective, spiritual, care, nausea, and, vomiting, are, common, in, people, who, have, advanced, terminal, illness, and, can, cause, distress, several, antiemetic, pharmacologic, options, are, suggested, to, help, alleviate, these, symptoms, for, people, who, do, not, respond, to, first, line, medications, levomepromazine, may, be, used, however, there, have, been, insufficient, clinical, trials, to, assess, the, effectiveness, of, this, medication, haloperidol, and, droperidol, are, other, medications, that, are, sometimes, prescribed, to, help, alleviate, nausea, and, vomiting, however, further, research, is, also, required, to, understand, how, effective, these, medications, may, be, many, terminally, ill, people, cannot, consume, adequate, food, or, drink, providing, medically, assisted, food, or, drink, to, prolong, their, life, and, improve, the, quality, of, their, life, is, common, however, there, have, been, few, high, quality, studies, to, determine, best, practices, and, the, effectiveness, of, these, approaches, one, instrument, used, in, palliative, care, is, the, edmonton, symptom, assessment, scale, esas, which, consists, of, eight, visual, analog, scales, vas, ranging, from, 0, 10, indicating, the, levels, of, pain, activity, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, sensation, of, well, being, and, sometimes, shortness, of, breath, a, score, of, 0, indicates, absence, of, the, symptom, and, a, score, of, 10, indicates, the, worst, possible, severity, the, instrument, can, be, completed, by, the, patient, with, or, without, assistance, or, by, nurses, and, relatives, pediatric, palliative, care, is, family, centered, specialized, medical, care, for, children, with, serious, illnesses, that, focuses, on, mitigating, the, physical, emotional, psychosocial, and, spiritual, suffering, associated, with, illness, to, ultimately, optimize, quality, of, life, pediatric, palliative, care, practitioners, receive, specialized, training, in, family, centered, developmental, and, age, appropriate, skills, in, communication, and, facilitation, of, shared, decision, making, assessment, and, management, of, pain, and, distressing, symptoms, advanced, knowledge, in, care, coordination, of, multidisciplinary, pediatric, caregiving, medical, teams, referral, to, hospital, and, ambulatory, resources, available, to, patients, and, families, and, psychologically, supporting, children, and, families, through, illness, and, bereavement, as, with, palliative, care, for, adults, symptom, assessment, and, management, is, a, critical, component, of, pediatric, palliative, care, as, it, improves, quality, of, life, gives, children, and, families, a, sense, of, control, and, prolongs, life, in, some, cases, the, general, approach, to, assessment, and, management, of, distressing, symptoms, in, children, by, a, palliative, care, team, is, as, follows, the, most, common, symptoms, in, children, with, severe, chronic, disease, appropriate, for, palliative, care, consultation, are, weakness, fatigue, pain, poor, appetite, weight, loss, agitation, lack, of, mobility, shortness, of, breath, nausea, and, vomiting, constipation, sadness, or, depression, drowsiness, difficulty, with, speech, headache, excess, secretions, anemia, pressure, area, problems, anxiety, fever, and, mouth, sores, the, most, common, end, of, life, symptoms, in, children, include, shortness, of, breath, cough, fatigue, pain, nausea, and, vomiting, agitation, and, anxiety, poor, concentration, skin, lesions, swelling, of, the, extremities, seizures, poor, appetite, difficulty, with, feeding, and, diarrhea, in, older, children, with, neurologic, and, neuromuscular, manifestations, of, disease, there, is, a, high, burden, of, anxiety, and, depression, that, correlates, with, disease, progression, increasing, disability, and, greater, dependence, on, carers, from, the, caregiver, s, perspective, families, find, changes, in, behavior, reported, pain, lack, of, appetite, changes, in, appearance, talking, to, god, or, angels, breathing, changes, weakness, and, fatigue, to, be, the, most, distressing, symptoms, to, witness, in, their, loved, ones, as, discussed, above, within, the, field, of, adult, palliative, medicine, validated, symptoms, assessment, tools, are, frequently, utilized, by, providers, but, these, tools, lack, essential, aspects, of, children, s, symptom, experience, within, pediatrics, there, is, not, a, comprehensive, symptoms, assessment, widely, employed, a, few, symptoms, assessment, tools, trialed, among, older, children, receiving, palliative, care, include, the, symptom, distress, scale, and, the, memorial, symptom, assessment, scale, and, childhood, cancer, stressors, inventory, quality, of, life, considerations, within, pediatrics, are, unique, and, an, important, component, of, symptoms, assessment, the, pediatric, cancer, quality, of, life, inventory, 32, pcql, 32, is, a, standardized, parent, proxy, report, which, assesses, cancer, treatment, related, symptoms, focusing, mainly, on, pain, and, nausea, but, again, this, tool, does, not, comprehensively, assess, all, palliative, are, symptoms, issues, symptom, assessment, tools, for, younger, age, groups, are, rarely, utilized, as, they, have, limited, value, especially, for, infants, and, young, children, who, are, not, at, a, developmental, stage, where, they, can, articulate, symptoms, within, the, realm, of, pediatric, medical, care, the, palliative, care, team, is, tasked, with, facilitating, family, centered, communication, with, children, and, their, families, as, well, as, multidisciplinary, pediatric, caregiving, medical, teams, to, forward, coordinated, medical, management, and, the, child, s, quality, of, life, strategies, for, communication, are, complex, as, the, pediatric, palliative, care, practitioners, must, facilitate, a, shared, understanding, of, and, consensus, for, goals, of, care, and, therapies, available, to, the, sick, child, amongst, multiple, medical, teams, who, often, have, different, areas, of, expertise, additionally, pediatric, palliative, care, practitioners, must, assess, both, the, sick, child, and, their, family, s, understanding, of, complex, illness, and, options, for, care, and, provide, accessible, thoughtful, education, to, address, knowledge, gaps, and, allow, for, informed, decision, making, finally, practitioners, are, supporting, children, and, families, in, the, queries, emotional, distress, and, decision, making, that, ensues, from, the, child, s, illness, many, frameworks, for, communication, have, been, established, within, the, medical, literature, but, the, field, of, pediatric, palliative, care, is, still, in, relative, infancy, communication, considerations, and, strategies, employed, in, a, palliative, setting, include, with, the, transition, in, the, population, toward, lower, child, mortality, and, lower, death, rates, countries, around, the, world, are, seeing, larger, elderly, populations, in, some, countries, this, means, a, growing, burden, on, national, resources, in, the, shape, of, social, security, and, health, care, payments, as, aging, populations, put, increasing, pressure, on, existing, resources, long, term, palliative, care, for, patients, non, communicable, chronic, conditions, has, emerged, as, a, necessary, approach, to, increase, these, patient, s, quality, of, life, through, prevention, and, relief, by, identifying, assessing, and, treating, the, source, of, pain, and, other, psychosocial, and, spiritual, problems, doctrine, of, catholic, church, as, a, traditional, reference, accepts, and, supports, the, use, of, palliative, care, most, of, main, religions, in, the, world, and, the, biggest, in, amount, of, believers, are, concordant, with, this, point, of, view, in, most, countries, hospice, care, and, palliative, care, is, provided, by, an, interdisciplinary, team, consisting, of, physicians, pharmacists, nurses, nursing, assistants, social, workers, chaplains, and, caregivers, in, some, countries, additional, members, of, the, team, may, include, certified, nursing, assistants, and, home, healthcare, aides, as, well, as, volunteers, from, the, community, largely, untrained, but, some, being, skilled, medical, personnel, and, housekeepers, in, the, united, kingdom, palliative, medicine, specialist, training, is, delivered, alongside, internal, medicine, stage, two, training, over, an, indicative, four, years, entry, into, palliative, medicine, training, is, possible, following, successful, completion, of, both, a, foundation, programme, and, a, core, training, programme, there, are, two, core, training, programmes, for, palliative, medicine, training, in, the, united, states, the, physician, sub, specialty, of, hospice, and, palliative, medicine, was, established, in, 2006, to, provide, expertise, in, the, care, of,

and, volunteers, are, crucial, to, the, palliative, care, system, caregivers, and, people, being, treated, often, form, lasting, friendships, over, the, course, of, care, as, a, consequence, caregivers, may, find, themselves, under, severe, emotional, and, physical, strain, opportunities, for, caregiver, respite, are, some, of, the, services, hospices, provide, to, promote, caregiver, well, being, respite, may, last, a, few, hours, up, to, several, days, the, latter, being, done, by, placing, the, primary, person, being, cared, for, in, a, nursing, home, or, inpatient, hospice,

been, a, full, specialty, of, medicine, since, 1989, and, training, is, governed, by, the, same, regulations, through, the, royal, college, of, physicians, as, with, any, other, medical, speciality, nurses, in, the, united, states, and, internationally, can, receive, continuing, education, credits, through, palliative, care, specific, trainings, such, as, those, offered, by, end, of, life, nursing, education, consortium, elnec, the, tata, memorial, centre, in, mumbai, has, offered, a, physician, s, course, in, palliative, medicine, since, 2012, the, first, one, of, its, kind, in, the, country, in, the, united, states, hospice, and, palliative, care, represent, two, different, aspects, of, care, with, similar, philosophies, but, with, different, payment, systems, and, location, of, services, palliative, care, services, are, most, often, provided, in, acute, care, hospitals, organized, around, an, interdisciplinary, consultation, service, with, or, without, an, acute, inpatient, palliative, care, unit, palliative, care, may, also, be, provided, in, the, dying, person, s, home, as, a, bridge, program, between, traditional, us, home, care, services, and, hospice, care, or,

are, also, highlighted, the, focus, on, a, person, s, quality, of, life, has, increased, greatly, since, the, 1990s, in, the, united, states, today, 55, of, hospitals, with, more, than, 100, beds, offer, a, palliative, care, program, and, nearly, one, fifth, of, community, hospitals, have, palliative, care, programs, a, relatively, recent, development, is, the, palliative, care, team, a, dedicated, health, care, team, that, is, entirely, geared, toward, palliative, treatment, physicians, practicing, palliative, care, do, not, always, receive, support, from, the, people, they, are, treating, family, members, healthcare, professionals, or, their, social, peers, more, than, half, of, physicians, in, one, survey, reported, that, they, have, had, at, least, one, experience, where, a, patient, s, family, members, another, physician, or, another, health, care, professional, had, characterized, their, work, as, being, euthanasia, murder, or, killing, during, the, last, five, years, a, quarter, of, them, had, received, similar, comments, from, their, own, friends, or, family, member, or, from, a, patient, despite, significant, progress, that, has, been, made, to, increase, access, to, palliative, care, within, the, united, states, and, other, countries, many, countries, have, not, yet, considered, palliative, care, as, a, public, health, problem, and, therefore, do, not, include, it, in, their, public, health, agenda, resources, and, cultural, attitudes, both, play, significant, roles, in, the, acceptance, and, implementation, of, palliative, care, in, the, health, care, agenda, a, study, identified, the, current, gaps, in, palliative, care, for, people, with, severe, mental, illness, smi, s, they, found, that, due, to, the, lack, of, resources, within, both, mental, health, and, end, of, life, services, people, with, smi, s, faced, a, number, of, barriers, to, accessing, timely, and, appropriate, palliative, care, they, called, for, a, multidisciplinary, team, approach, including, advocacy, with, a, point, of, contact, co, ordinating, the, appropriate, support, for, the, individual, they, also, state, that, end, of, life, and, mental, health, care, needs, to, be, included, in, the, training, for, professionals, a, review, states, that, by, restricting, referrals, to, palliative, care, only, when, patients, have, a, definitive, time, line, for, death, something, that, the, study, found, to, often, be, inaccurate, can, have, negative, implications, for, the, patient, both, when, accessing, end, of, life, care, or, being, unable, to, access, services, due, to, not, receiving, a, time, line, from, medical, professionals, the, authors, call, for, a, less, rigid, approach, to, referrals, to, palliative, care, services, in, order, to, better, support, the, individual, improve, quality, of, life, remaining, and, provide, more, holistic, care, many, people, with, chronic, pain, are, stigmatized, and, treated, as, opioid, addicts, patients, can, build, a, tolerance, to, drugs, and, have, to, take, more, and, more, to, manage, their, pain, the, symptoms, of, chronic, pain, patients, do, not, show, up, on, scans, so, the, doctor, must, go, off, trust, alone, this, is, the, reason, that, some, wait, to, consult, their, doctor, and, endure, sometimes, years, of, pain, before, seeking, help, palliative,

open, letter, to, the, singer, david, bowie, written, by, a, palliative, care, doctor, professor, mark, taubert, talked, about, the, importance, of, good, palliative, care, being, able, to, express, wishes, about, the, last, months, of, life, and, good, tuition, nutrition, and, education, about, end, of, life, care, generally, the, letter, went, viral, after, david, bowie, s, son, duncan, jones,

showing, which, services, were, available, and, grouped, them, according, to, their, intended, purpose, and, benefit, to, the, patient, they, also, stated, that, currently, in, the, uk, palliative, services, are, only, available, to, patients, with, a, timeline, to, death, usually, 12, months, or, less, they, found, these, timelines, to, often, be, inaccurate, and, created, barriers, to, patients, accessing, appropriate, services, they, call, for, a, more, holistic, approach, to, end, of, life, care, which, is, not, restricted, by, arbitrary, timelines
