bronchitis, is, inflammation, of, the, bronchi, large, and, medium, sized, airways, in, the, lungs, that, causes, coughing, bronchitis, usually, begins, as, an, infection, in, the, nose, ears, throat, or, sinuses, the, infection, then, makes, its, way, down, to, the, bronchi, symptoms, include, coughing, up, sputum, wheezing, shortness, of, breath, and, chest, pain, bronchitis, can, be, acute, or, chronic, acute, bronchitis, usually, has, a, cough, that, lasts, around, three, weeks, and, is, also, known, as, a, chest, cold, in, more, than, 90, of, cases, the, cause, is, a, viral, infection, these, viruses, may, be, spread, through, the, air, when, people, cough, or, by, direct, contact, a, small, number, of, cases, are, caused, by, a, bacterial, infection, such, as, mycoplasma, pneumoniae, or, bordetella, pertussis, risk, factors, include, exposure, to, tobacco, smoke, dust, and, other, air, pollution, treatment, of, acute, bronchitis, typically, involves, rest, paracetamol, acetaminophen, and, nonsteroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, nsaids, to, help, with, the, fever, chronic, bronchitis, is, defined, as, a, productive, cough, one, that, produces, sputum, that, lasts, for, three, months, or, more, per, year, for, at, least, two, years, many, people, with, chronic, bronchitis, also, have, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, tobacco, smoking, is, the, most, common, cause, with, a, number, of, other, factors, such, as, air, pollution, and, genetics, playing, a, smaller, role, treatments, include, quitting, smoking, vaccinations, rehabilitation, and, often, inhaled, bronchodilators, and, steroids, some, people, may, benefit, from, long, term, oxygen, therapy, acute, bronchitis, is, one, of, the, more, common, diseases, about, 5, of, adults, and, 6, of, children, have, at, least, one, episode, a, year, acute, bronchitis, is, the, most, common, type, of, bronchitis, by, contrast, in, the, united, states, in, 2018, 9, 3, million, people, were, diagnosed, with, the, less, common, chronic, bronchitis, acute, bronchitis, also, known, as, a, chest, cold, is, short, term, inflammation, of, the, bronchi, of, the, lungs, the, most, common, symptom, is, a, cough, that, may, or, may, not, produce, sputum, other, symptoms, may, include, coughing, up, mucus, wheezing, shortness, of, breath, fever, and, chest, discomfort, fever, when, present, is, mild, the, infection, may, last, from, a, few, to, ten, days, the, cough, may, persist, for, several, weeks, afterwards, with, the, total, duration, of, symptoms, usually, around, three, weeks, symptoms, may, last, for, up, to, six, weeks, in, more, than, 90, of, cases, the, cause, is, a, viral, infection, these, viruses, may, spread, through, the, air, when, people, cough, or, by, direct, contact, risk, factors, include, exposure, to, tobacco, smoke, dust, and, other, air, pollutants, a, small, number, of, cases, are, due, to, bacteria, such, as, mycoplasma, pneumoniae, or, bordetella, pertussis, diagnosis, is, typically, based, on, a, person, s, signs, and, symptoms, the, color, of, the, sputum, does, not, indicate, if, the, infection, is, viral, or, bacterial, determining, the, underlying, organism, is, usually, not, required, other, causes, of, similar, symptoms, include, asthma, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis, and, copd, a, chest, x, ray, may, be, useful, to, detect, pneumonia, another, common, sign, of, bronchitis, is, a, cough, which, lasts, ten, days, to, three, weeks, if, the, cough, lasts, for, longer, than, a, month, it, may, become, chronic, bronchitis, in, addition, a, fever, may, be, present, acute, bronchitis, is, normally, caused, by, a, viral, infection, typically, these, infections, are, rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza, or, influenza, no, specific, testing, is, normally, needed, in, order, to, diagnose, acute, bronchitis, one, form, of, prevention, is, to, avoid, smoking, and, other, lung, irritants, frequent, hand, washing, may, also, be, protective, treatment, for, acute, bronchitis, usually, involves, rest, paracetamol, acetaminophen, and, nsaids, to, help, with, the, fever, cough, medicine, has, little, support, for, its, use, and, is, not, recommended, in, children, under, the, age, of, six, there, is, tentative, evidence, that, salbutamol, may, be, useful, in, treating, wheezing, however, it, may, result, in, nervousness, and, tremors, antibiotics, should, generally, not, be, used, an, exception, is, when, acute, bronchitis, is, due, to, pertussis, tentative, evidence, supports, honey, and, pelargonium, to, help, with, symptoms, getting, plenty, of, rest, and, drinking, enough, fluids, are, often, recommended, as, well, chinese, medicinal, herbs, are, of, unclear, effect, acute, bronchitis, is, one, of, the, most, common, diseases, and, the, most, common, type, of, bronchitis, about, 5, of, adults, are, affected, and, about, 6, of, children, have, at, least, one, episode, a, year, it, occurs, more, often, in, the, winter, more, than, 10, million, people, in, the, us, visit, a, doctor, each, year, for, this, condition, with, about, 70, receiving, antibiotics, which, are, mostly, not, needed, there, are, efforts, to, decrease, the, use, of, antibiotics, in, acute, bronchitis, chronic, bronchitis, is, a, lower, respiratory, tract, disease, defined, by, a, productive, cough, that, lasts, for, three, months, or, more, per, year, for, at, least, two, years, the, cough, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, smoker, s, cough, since, it, often, results, from, smoking, when, chronic, bronchitis, occurs, together, with, decreased, airflow, it, is, known, as, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, many, people, with, chronic, bronchitis, have, copd, however, most, people, with, copd, do, not, also, have, chronic, bronchitis, estimates, of, the, number, of, people, with, copd, who, have, chronic, bronchitis, are, 7, to, 40, estimates, of, the, number, of, people, who, smoke, and, have, chronic, bronchitis, who, also, have, copd, is, 60, the, term, chronic, bronchitis, was, used, in, previous, definitions, of, copd, but, is, no, longer, included, in, the, definition, the, term, is, still, used, clinically, while, both, chronic, bronchitis, and, emphysema, are, often, associated, with, copd, neither, is, needed, to, make, the, diagnosis, a, chinese, consensus, commented, on, symptomatic, types, of, copd, that, include, chronic, bronchitis, with, frequent, exacerbations, chronic, bronchitis, is, marked, by, mucus, hypersecretion, and, mucins, the, excess, mucus, is, produced, by, an, increased, number, of, goblet, cells, and, enlarged, submucosal, glands, in, response, to, long, term, irritation, the, mucous, glands, in, the, submucosa, secrete, more, than, the, goblet, cells, mucins, thicken, mucus, and, their, concentration, has, been, found, to, be, high, in, cases, of, chronic, bronchitis, and, also, to, correlate, with, the, severity, of, the, disease, excess, mucus, can, narrow, the, airways, thereby, limiting, airflow, and, accelerating, the, decline, in, lung, function, and, result, in, copd, excess, mucus, shows, itself, as, a, chronic, productive, cough, and, its, severity, and, volume, of, sputum, can, fluctuate, in, periods, of, acute, exacerbations, in, copd, those, with, the, chronic, bronchitic, phenotype, with, associated, chronic, excess, mucus, experience, a, worse, quality, of, life, than, those, without, the, increased, secretions, are, initially, cleared, by, coughing, the, cough, is, often, worse, soon, after, awakening, and, the, sputum, produced, may, have, a, yellow, or, green, color, and, may, be, streaked, with, specks, of, blood, in, the, early, stages, a, cough, can, maintain, mucus, clearance, however, with, continued, excessive, secretion, mucus, clearance, is, impaired, and, when, the, airways, become, obstructed, a, cough, becomes, ineffective, effective, mucociliary, clearance, depends, on, airway, hydration, ciliary, beating, and, the, rates, of, mucin, secretion, each, of, these, factors, is, impaired, in, chronic, bronchitis, chronic, bronchitis, can, lead, to, a, higher, number, of, exacerbations, and, a, faster, decline, in, lung, function, the, icd, 11, lists, chronic, bronchitis, with, emphysema, emphysematous, bronchitis, as, a, certain, specified, copd, most, cases, of, chronic, bronchitis, are, caused, by, tobacco, smoking, chronic, bronchitis, in, young, adults, who, smoke, is, associated, with, a, greater, chance, of, developing, copd, there, is, an, association, between, smoking, cannabis, and, chronic, bronchitis, in, addition, chronic, inhalation, of, air, pollution, or, irritating, fumes, or, dust, from, hazardous, exposures, in, occupations, such, as, coal, mining, grain, handling, textile, manufacturing, livestock, farming, and, metal, moulding, may, also, be, a, risk, factor, for, the, development, of, chronic, bronchitis, bronchitis, caused, in, this, way, is, often, referred, to, as, industrial, bronchitis, or, occupational, bronchitis, rarely, genetic, factors, also, play, a, role, air, quality, can, also, affect, the, respiratory, system, with, higher, levels, of, nitrogen, dioxide, and, sulfur, dioxide, contributing, to, bronchial, symptoms, sulfur, dioxide, can, cause, inflammation, which, can, aggravate, chronic, bronchitis, and, make, infections, more, likely, air, pollution, in, the, workplace, is, the, cause, of, several, non, communicable, diseases, ncds, including, chronic, bronchitis, decline, in, lung, function, in, chronic, bronchitis, may, be, slowed, by, stopping, smoking, chronic, bronchitis, may, be, treated, with, a, number, of, medications, and, occasionally, oxygen, therapy, pulmonary, rehabilitation, may, also, be, used, a, distinction, has, been, made, between, exacerbations, sudden, worsenings, of, chronic, bronchitis, and, otherwise, stable, chronic, bronchitis, stable, chronic, bronchitis, can, be, defined, as, the, normal, definition, of, chronic, bronchitis, plus, the, absence, of, an, acute, exacerbation, in, the, previous, four, weeks, a, cochrane, review, found, that, mucolytics, in, chronic, bronchitis, may, slightly, decrease, the, chance, of, developing, an, exacerbation, the, mucolytic, guaifenesin, is, a, safe, and, effective, treatment, for, stable, chronic, bronchitis, this, has, an, advantage, in, that, it, is, available, as, an, extended, use, tablet, which, lasts, for, twelve, hours, erdosteine, is, a, mucolytic, recommended, by, nice, gold, also, supports, the, use, of, some, mucolytics, that, are, advised, against, when, inhaled, corticosteroids, are, being, used, and, singles, out, erdosteine, as, having, good, effects, regardless, of, corticosteroid, use, erdosteine, also, has, antioxidant, properties, erdosteine, has, been, shown, to, significantly, reduce, the, risk, of, exacerbations, shorten, their, duration, and, hospital, stays, in, those, with, the, chronic, bronchitic, phenotype, of, copd, the, phosphodiesterase, 4, inhibitor, roflumilast, may, decrease, significant, exacerbations, chronic, bronchitis, affects, about, 3, 4, to, 22, of, the, general, population, individuals, over, 45, years, of, age, smokers, those, that, live, or, work, in, areas, with, high, air, pollution, and, anybody, with, asthma, all, have, a, higher, risk, of, developing, chronic, bronchitis, this, wide, range, is, due, to, the, different, definitions, of, chronic, bronchitis, that, can, be, diagnosed, based, on, signs, and, symptoms, or, the, clinical, diagnosis, of, the, disorder, chronic, bronchitis, tends, to, affect, men, more, often, than, women, while, the, primary, risk, factor, for, chronic, bronchitis, is, smoking, there, is, still, a, 4, 22, chance, that, non, smokers, can, get, chronic, bronchitis, this, might, suggest, other, risk, factors, such, as, the, inhalation, of, fuels, dusts, fumes, and, genetic, factor, in, the, united, states, in, 2016, 8, 6, million, people, were, diagnosed, with, chronic, bronchitis, and, there, were, 518, reported, deaths, per, 100, 000, of, population, the, death, rate, of, chronic, bronchitis, was, 0, 2, the, condition, of, bronchitis, has, been, recognised, for, many, centuries, in, several, different, cultures, including, the, ancient, greek, chinese, and, indian, with, the, presence, of, excess, phlegm, and, cough, noted, in, recognition, of, the, same, condition, early, treatments, of, chronic, bronchitis, included, garlic, cinnamon, and, ipecac, among, others, modern, treatments, were, developed, during, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, british, physician, charles, badham, was, the, first, person, to, describe, the, condition, and, name, the, acute, form, as, acute, bronchitis, in, his, book, observations, on, the, inflammatory, affections, of, the, mucous, membrane, of, the, bronchi, published, in, 1808, in, this, book, badham, distinguished, three, forms, of, bronchitis, including, acute, and, chronic, a, second, expanded, edition, of, the, book, was, published, in, 1814, with, the, title, an, essay, on, bronchitis, badham, used, the, term, catarrh, to, refer, to, the, cardinal, symptoms, of, chronic, cough, and, mucus, hypersecretion, of, chronic, bronchitis, and, described, chronic, bronchitis, as, a, disabling, disorder, in, 1901, an, article, was, published, on, the, treatment, of, chronic, bronchitis, in, the, elderly, the, symptoms, described, have, remained, unchanged, the, cause, was, thought, to, be, brought, on, by, dampness, cold, weather, and, foggy, conditions, and, treatments, were, aimed, towards, various, cough, mixtures, respiratory, stimulants, and, tonics, it, was, noted, that, something, other, than, the, weather, was, thought, to, be, at, play, exacerbations, of, the, condition, were, also, described, at, this, time, another, physician, harry, campbell, was, referred, to, who, had, written, in, the, british, medical, journal, a, week, before, campbell, had, suggested, that, the, cause, of, chronic, bronchitis, was, due, to, toxic, substances, and, recommended, pure, air, simple, food, and, exercise, to, remove, them, from, the, body, a, joint, research, programme, was, undertaken, in, chicago, and, london, from, 1951, to, 1953, in, which, the, clinical, features, of, one, thousand, cases, of, chronic, bronchitis, were, detailed, the, findings, were, published, in, the, lancet, in, 1953, it, was, stated, that, since, its, introduction, by, badham, chronic, bronchitis, had, become, an, increasingly, popular, diagnosis, the, study, had, looked, at, various, associations, such, as, the, weather, conditions, at, home, and, at, work, age, of, onset, childhood, illnesses, smoking, habits, and, breathlessness, it, was, concluded, that, chronic, bronchitis, invariably, led, to, emphysema, particularly, when, the, bronchitis, had, persisted, for, a, long, time, in, 1957, it, was, noted, that, at, the, time, there, were, many, investigations, being, carried, out, into, chronic, bronchitis, and, emphysema, in, general, and, among, industrial, workers, exposed, to, dust, excerpts, were, published, dating, from, 1864, in, which, charles, parsons, had, noted, the, occurring, consequence, of, the, development, of, emphysema, from, bronchitis, this, was, seen, to, be, not, always, applicable, his, findings, were, in, association, with, his, studies, on, chronic, bronchitis, among, pottery, workers, a, ciba, now, novartis, meeting, in, 1959, and, a, meeting, of, the, american, thoracic, society, in, 1962, defined, chronic, bronchitis, as, a, component, of, copd, in, the, terms, that, have, not, changed, eosinophilic, bronchitis, is, a, chronic, dry, cough, defined, by, the, presence, of, an, increased, number, of, a, type, of, white, blood, cell, known, as, eosinophils, it, has, a, normal, finding, on, x, ray, and, has, no, airflow, limitation, protracted, bacterial, bronchitis, in, children, is, defined, as, a, chronic, productive, cough, with, a, positive, bronchoalveolar, lavage, that, resolves, with, antibiotics, protracted, bacterial, bronchitis, is, usually, caused, by, streptococcus, pneumoniae, non, typable, haemophilus, influenzae, or, moraxella, catarrhalis, protracted, bacterial, bronchitis, lasting, more, than, 4, weeks, in, children, may, be, helped, by, antibiotics, plastic, bronchitis, is, a, rarely, found, condition, in, which, thickened, secretions, plug, the, bronchi, the, plugs, are, rubbery, or, plastic, feeling, thus, the, name, the, light, colored, plugs, take, the, branching, shape, of, the, bronchi, that, they, fill, and, are, known, as, bronchial, casts, when, these, casts, are, coughed, up, they, are, firmer, in, texture, from, typical, phlegm, or, the, short, softer, mucus, plugs, seen, in, some, people, with, asthma, however, some, people, with, asthma, have, larger, firmer, and, more, complex, plugs, these, differ, from, the, casts, seen, in, people, whose, plastic, bronchitis, is, associated, with, congenital, heart, disease, or, lymphatic, vessel, abnormalities, mainly, because, eosinophils, and, charcot, leyden, crystals, are, present, in, the, asthma, associated, casts, but, not, in, the, others, casts, obstruct, the, airflow, and, can, result, in, the, overinflation, of, the, opposite, lung, plastic, bronchitis, usually, occurs, in, children, some, cases, may, result, from, abnormalities, in, the, lymphatic, vessels, advanced, cases, may, show, imaging, similarities, to, bronchiectasis, aspergillus, bronchitis, is, one, of, the, aspergillosis, spectrum, of, diseases, in, which, the, bronchi, are, specifically, subject, to, a, fungal, infection, this, differs, from, the, other, pulmonary, aspergillosis, conditions, in, that, it, need, not, affect, just, the, immunocompromised
