a, deer, pl, deer, or, true, deer, is, a, hoofed, ruminant, ungulate, of, the, family, cervidae, informally, the, deer, family, cervidae, is, divided, into, subfamilies, cervinae, which, includes, among, others, muntjac, elk, wapiti, red, deer, and, fallow, deer, and, capreolinae, which, includes, among, others, reindeer, caribou, white, tailed, deer, roe, deer, and, moose, male, deer, of, almost, all, species, except, the, water, deer, as, well, as, female, reindeer, grow, and, shed, new, antlers, each, year, these, antlers, are, bony, extensions, of, the, skull, and, are, often, used, for, combat, between, males, the, musk, deer, moschidae, of, asia, and, chevrotains, tragulidae, of, tropical, african, and, asian, forests, are, separate, families, that, are, also, in, the, ruminant, clade, ruminantia, they, are, not, especially, closely, related, to, cervidae, deer, appear, in, art, from, paleolithic, cave, paintings, onwards, and, they, have, played, a, role, in, mythology, religion, and, literature, throughout, history, as, well, as, in, heraldry, such, as, red, deer, that, appear, in, the, coat, of, arms, of, land, their, economic, importance, includes, the, use, of, their, meat, as, venison, their, skins, as, soft, strong, buckskin, and, their, antlers, as, handles, for, knives, deer, hunting, has, been, a, popular, activity, since, the, middle, ages, and, remains, a, resource, for, many, families, today, the, word, deer, was, originally, broad, in, meaning, becoming, more, specific, with, time, old, english, d, or, and, middle, english, der, meant, a, wild, animal, of, any, kind, cognates, of, old, english, d, or, in, other, dead, germanic, languages, have, the, general, sense, of, animal, such, as, old, high, german, tior, old, norse, djur, or, d, r, gothic, dius, old, saxon, dier, and, old, frisian, diar, this, general, sense, gave, way, to, the, modern, english, sense, by, the, end, of, the, middle, english, period, around, 1500, all, modern, germanic, languages, save, english, and, scots, retain, the, more, general, sense, for, example, dutch, frisian, dier, german, tier, and, norwegian, dyr, mean, animal, for, many, types, of, deer, in, modern, english, usage, the, male, is, a, buck, and, the, female, a, doe, but, the, terms, vary, with, dialect, and, according, to, the, size, of, the, species, the, male, red, deer, is, a, stag, while, for, other, large, species, the, male, is, a, bull, the, female, a, cow, as, in, cattle, in, older, usage, the, male, of, any, species, is, a, hart, especially, if, over, five, years, old, and, the, female, is, a, hind, especially, if, three, or, more, years, old, the, young, of, small, species, is, a, fawn, and, of, large, species, a, calf, a, very, small, young, may, be, a, kid, a, castrated, male, is, a, havier, a, group, of, any, species, is, a, herd, the, adjective, of, relation, is, cervine, like, the, family, name, cervidae, this, is, from, latin, cervus, meaning, stag, or, deer, deer, live, in, a, variety, of, biomes, ranging, from, tundra, to, the, tropical, rainforest, while, often, associated, with, forests, many, deer, are, ecotone, species, that, live, in, transitional, areas, between, forests, and, thickets, for, cover, and, prairie, and, savanna, open, space, the, majority, of, large, deer, species, inhabit, temperate, mixed, deciduous, forest, mountain, mixed, coniferous, forest, tropical, seasonal, dry, forest, and, savanna, habitats, around, the, world, clearing, open, areas, within, forests, to, some, extent, may, actually, benefit, deer, populations, by, exposing, the, understory, and, allowing, the, types, of, grasses, weeds, and, herbs, to, grow, that, deer, like, to, eat, access, to, adjacent, croplands, may, also, benefit, deer, adequate, forest, or, brush, cover, must, still, be, provided, for, populations, to, grow, and, thrive, deer, are, widely, distributed, with, indigenous, representatives, in, all, continents, except, antarctica, and, australia, though, africa, has, only, one, native, deer, the, barbary, stag, a, subspecies, of, red, deer, that, is, confined, to, the, atlas, mountains, in, the, northwest, of, the, continent, another, extinct, species, of, deer, megaceroides, algericus, was, present, in, north, africa, until, 6000, years, ago, fallow, deer, have, been, introduced, to, south, africa, small, species, of, brocket, deer, and, pud, s, of, central, and, south, america, and, muntjacs, of, asia, generally, occupy, dense, forests, and, are, less, often, seen, in, open, spaces, with, the, possible, exception, of, the, indian, muntjac, there, are, also, several, species, of, deer, that, are, highly, specialized, and, live, almost, exclusively, in, mountains, grasslands, swamps, and, wet, savannas, or, riparian, corridors, surrounded, by, deserts, some, deer, have, a, circumpolar, distribution, in, both, north, america, and, eurasia, examples, include, the, caribou, that, live, in, arctic, tundra, and, taiga, boreal, forests, and, moose, that, inhabit, taiga, and, adjacent, areas, huemul, deer, taruca, and, chilean, huemul, of, south, america, s, andes, fill, the, ecological, niches, of, the, ibex, and, wild, goat, with, the, fawns, behaving, more, like, goat, kids, the, highest, concentration, of, large, deer, species, in, temperate, north, america, lies, in, the, canadian, rocky, mountain, and, columbia, mountain, regions, between, alberta, and, british, columbia, where, all, five, north, american, deer, species, white, tailed, deer, mule, deer, caribou, elk, and, moose, can, be, found, this, region, has, several, clusters, of, national, parks, including, mount, revelstoke, national, park, glacier, national, park, canada, yoho, national, park, and, kootenay, national, park, on, the, british, columbia, side, and, banff, national, park, jasper, national, park, and, glacier, national, park, u, s, on, the, alberta, and, montana, sides, mountain, slope, habitats, vary, from, moist, coniferous, mixed, forested, habitats, to, dry, subalpine, pine, forests, with, alpine, meadows, higher, up, the, foothills, and, river, valleys, between, the, mountain, ranges, provide, a, mosaic, of, cropland, and, deciduous, parklands, the, rare, woodland, caribou, have, the, most, restricted, range, living, at, higher, altitudes, in, the, subalpine, meadows, and, alpine, tundra, areas, of, some, of, the, mountain, ranges, elk, and, mule, deer, both, migrate, between, the, alpine, meadows, and, lower, coniferous, forests, and, tend, to, be, most, common, in, this, region, elk, also, inhabit, river, valley, bottomlands, which, they, share, with, white, tailed, deer, the, white, tailed, deer, have, recently, expanded, their, range, within, the, foothills, and, river, valley, bottoms, of, the, canadian, rockies, owing, to, conversion, of, land, to, cropland, and, the, clearing, of, coniferous, forests, allowing, more, deciduous, vegetation, to, grow, up, the, mountain, slopes, they, also, live, in, the, aspen, parklands, north, of, calgary, and, edmonton, where, they, share, habitat, with, the, moose, the, adjacent, great, plains, grassland, habitats, are, left, to, herds, of, elk, american, bison, and, pronghorn, the, eurasian, continent, including, the, indian, subcontinent, boasts, the, most, species, of, deer, in, the, world, with, most, species, being, found, in, asia, europe, in, comparison, has, lower, diversity, in, plant, and, animal, species, many, national, parks, and, protected, reserves, in, europe, have, populations, of, red, deer, roe, deer, and, fallow, deer, these, species, have, long, been, associated, with, the, continent, of, europe, but, also, inhabit, asia, minor, the, caucasus, mountains, and, northwestern, iran, european, fallow, deer, historically, lived, over, much, of, europe, during, the, ice, ages, but, afterwards, became, restricted, primarily, to, the, anatolian, peninsula, in, present, day, turkey, present, day, fallow, deer, populations, in, europe, are, a, result, of, historic, man, made, introductions, of, this, species, first, to, the, mediterranean, regions, of, europe, then, eventually, to, the, rest, of, europe, they, were, initially, park, animals, that, later, escaped, and, reestablished, themselves, in, the, wild, historically, europe, s, deer, species, shared, their, deciduous, forest, habitat, with, other, herbivores, such, as, the, extinct, tarpan, forest, horse, extinct, aurochs, forest, ox, and, the, endangered, wisent, european, bison, good, places, to, see, deer, in, europe, include, the, scottish, highlands, the, austrian, alps, the, wetlands, between, austria, hungary, and, the, czech, republic, and, some, national, parks, including, do, ana, national, park, in, spain, the, veluwe, in, the, netherlands, the, ardennes, in, belgium, and, bia, owie, a, national, park, in, poland, spain, eastern, europe, and, the, caucasus, mountains, have, forest, areas, that, are, not, only, home, to, sizable, deer, populations, but, also, other, animals, that, were, once, abundant, such, as, the, wisent, eurasian, lynx, iberian, lynx, wolves, and, brown, bears, the, highest, concentration, of, large, deer, species, in, temperate, asia, occurs, in, the, mixed, deciduous, forests, mountain, coniferous, forests, and, taiga, bordering, north, korea, manchuria, northeastern, china, and, the, ussuri, region, russia, these, are, among, some, of, the, richest, deciduous, and, coniferous, forests, in, the, world, where, one, can, find, siberian, roe, deer, sika, deer, elk, and, moose, asian, caribou, occupy, the, northern, fringes, of, this, region, along, the, sino, russian, border, deer, such, as, the, sika, deer, thorold, s, deer, central, asian, red, deer, and, elk, have, historically, been, farmed, for, their, antlers, by, han, chinese, turkic, peoples, tungusic, peoples, mongolians, and, koreans, like, the, sami, people, of, finland, and, scandinavia, the, tungusic, peoples, mongolians, and, turkic, peoples, of, southern, siberia, northern, mongolia, and, the, ussuri, region, have, also, taken, to, raising, semi, domesticated, herds, of, asian, caribou, the, highest, concentration, of, large, deer, species, in, the, tropics, occurs, in, southern, asia, in, india, s, indo, gangetic, plain, region, and, nepal, s, terai, region, these, fertile, plains, consist, of, tropical, seasonal, moist, deciduous, dry, deciduous, forests, and, both, dry, and, wet, savannas, that, are, home, to, chital, hog, deer, barasingha, indian, sambar, and, indian, muntjac, grazing, species, such, as, the, endangered, barasingha, and, very, common, chital, are, gregarious, and, live, in, large, herds, indian, sambar, can, be, gregarious, but, are, usually, solitary, or, live, in, smaller, herds, hog, deer, are, solitary, and, have, lower, densities, than, indian, muntjac, deer, can, be, seen, in, several, national, parks, in, india, nepal, and, sri, lanka, of, which, kanha, national, park, dudhwa, national, park, and, chitwan, national, park, are, most, famous, sri, lanka, s, wilpattu, national, park, and, yala, national, park, have, large, herds, of, indian, sambar, and, chital, the, indian, sambar, are, more, gregarious, in, sri, lanka, than, other, parts, of, their, range, and, tend, to, form, larger, herds, than, elsewhere, the, chao, praya, river, valley, of, thailand, was, once, primarily, tropical, seasonal, moist, deciduous, forest, and, wet, savanna, that, hosted, populations, of, hog, deer, the, now, extinct, schomburgk, s, deer, eld, s, deer, indian, sambar, and, indian, muntjac, both, the, hog, deer, and, eld, s, deer, are, rare, whereas, indian, sambar, and, indian, muntjac, thrive, in, protected, national, parks, such, as, khao, yai, many, of, these, south, asian, and, southeast, asian, deer, species, also, share, their, habitat, with, other, herbivores, such, as, asian, elephants, the, various, asian, rhinoceros, species, various, antelope, species, such, as, nilgai, four, horned, antelope, blackbuck, and, indian, gazelle, in, india, and, wild, oxen, such, as, wild, asian, water, buffalo, gaur, banteng, and, kouprey, one, way, that, different, herbivores, can, survive, together, in, a, given, area, is, for, each, species, to, have, different, food, preferences, although, there, may, be, some, overlap, as, a, result, of, acclimatisation, society, releases, in, the, 19th, century, australia, has, six, introduced, species, of, deer, that, have, established, sustainable, wild, populations, they, are, fallow, deer, red, deer, sambar, hog, deer, rusa, and, chital, red, deer, were, introduced, into, new, zealand, in, 1851, from, english, and, scottish, stock, many, have, been, domesticated, in, deer, farms, since, the, late, 1960s, and, are, common, farm, animals, there, now, seven, other, species, of, deer, were, introduced, into, new, zealand, but, none, are, as, widespread, as, red, deer, deer, constitute, the, second, most, diverse, family, of, artiodactyla, after, bovids, though, of, a, similar, build, deer, are, strongly, distinguished, from, antelopes, by, their, antlers, which, are, temporary, and, regularly, regrown, unlike, the, permanent, horns, of, bovids, characteristics, typical, of, deer, include, long, powerful, legs, a, diminutive, tail, and, long, ears, deer, exhibit, a, broad, variation, in, physical, proportions, the, largest, extant, deer, is, the, moose, which, is, nearly, 2, 6, metres, 8, ft, 6, in, tall, and, weighs, up, to, 800, kilograms, 1, 800, lb, the, elk, stands, 1, 4, 2, metres, 4, ft, 7, in, 6, ft, 7, in, at, the, shoulder, and, weighs, 240, 450, kilograms, 530, 990, lb, the, northern, pudu, is, the, smallest, deer, in, the, world, it, reaches, merely, 32, 35, centimetres, 12, 1, 2, 14, in, at, the, shoulder, and, weighs, 3, 3, 6, kilograms, 7, 1, 4, 13, 1, 4, lb, the, southern, pudu, is, only, slightly, taller, and, heavier, sexual, dimorphism, is, quite, pronounced, in, most, species, males, tend, to, be, larger, than, females, and, except, for, the, reindeer, only, males, have, antlers, coat, colour, generally, varies, between, red, and, brown, though, it, can, be, as, dark, as, chocolate, brown, in, the, tufted, deer, or, have, a, grayish, tinge, as, in, elk, different, species, of, brocket, deer, vary, from, gray, to, reddish, brown, in, coat, colour, several, species, such, as, the, chital, the, fallow, deer, and, the, sika, deer, feature, white, spots, on, a, brown, coat, coat, of, reindeer, shows, notable, geographical, variation, deer, undergo, two, moults, in, a, year, for, instance, in, red, deer, the, red, thin, haired, summer, coat, is, gradually, replaced, by, the, dense, greyish, brown, winter, coat, in, autumn, which, in, turn, gives, way, to, the, summer, coat, in, the, following, spring, moulting, is, affected, by, the, photoperiod, deer, are, also, excellent, jumpers, and, swimmers, deer, are, ruminants, or, cud, chewers, and, have, a, four, chambered, stomach, some, deer, such, as, those, on, the, island, of, r, m, do, consume, meat, when, it, is, available, nearly, all, deer, have, a, facial, gland, in, front, of, each, eye, the, gland, contains, a, strongly, scented, pheromone, used, to, mark, its, home, range, bucks, of, a, wide, range, of, species, open, these, glands, wide, when, angry, or, excited, all, deer, have, a, liver, without, a, gallbladder, deer, also, have, a, tapetum, lucidum, which, gives, them, sufficiently, good, night, vision, all, male, deer, have, antlers, with, the, exception, of, the, water, deer, in, which, males, have, long, tusk, like, canines, that, reach, below, the, lower, jaw, females, generally, lack, antlers, though, female, reindeer, bear, antlers, smaller, and, less, branched, than, those, of, the, males, occasionally, females, in, other, species, may, develop, antlers, especially, in, telemetacarpal, deer, such, as, european, roe, deer, red, deer, white, tailed, deer, and, mule, deer, and, less, often, in, plesiometacarpal, deer, a, study, of, antlered, female, white, tailed, deer, noted, that, antlers, tend, to, be, small, and, malformed, and, are, shed, frequently, around, the, time, of, parturition, the, fallow, deer, and, the, various, subspecies, of, the, reindeer, have, the, largest, as, well, as, the, heaviest, antlers, both, in, absolute, terms, as, well, as, in, proportion, to, body, mass, an, average, of, eight, grams, per, kilogram, of, body, mass, the, tufted, deer, on, the, other, hand, has, the, smallest, antlers, of, all, deer, while, the, pud, has, the, lightest, antlers, with, respect, to, body, mass, 0, 6, g, per, kilogram, of, body, mass, the, structure, of, antlers, show, considerable, variation, while, fallow, deer, and, elk, antlers, are, palmate, with, a, broad, central, portion, white, tailed, deer, antlers, include, a, series, of, tines, sprouting, upward, from, a, forward, curving, main, beam, and, those, of, the, pud, are, mere, spikes, antler, development, begins, from, the, pedicel, a, bony, structure, that, appears, on, the, top, of, the, skull, by, the, time, the, animal, is, a, year, old, the, pedicel, gives, rise, to, a, spiky, antler, the, following, year, that, is, replaced, by, a, branched, antler, in, the, third, year, this, process, of, losing, a, set, of, antlers, to, develop, a, larger, and, more, branched, set, continues, for, the, rest, of, the, life, the, antlers, emerge, as, soft, tissues, known, as, velvet, antlers, and, progressively, harden, into, bony, structures, known, as, hard, antlers, following, mineralisation, and, blockage, of, blood, vessels, in, the, tissue, from, the, tip, to, the, base, antlers, might, be, one, of, the, most, exaggerated, male, secondary, sexual, characteristics, and, are, intended, primarily, for, reproductive, success, through, sexual, selection, and, for, combat, the, tines, forks, on, the, antlers, create, grooves, that, allow, another, male, s, antlers, to, lock, into, place, this, allows, the, males, to, wrestle, without, risking, injury, to, the, face, antlers, are, correlated, to, an, individual, s, position, in, the, social, hierarchy, and, its, behaviour, for, instance, the, heavier, the, antlers, the, higher, the, individual, s, status, in, the, social, hierarchy, and, the, greater, the, delay, in, shedding, the, antlers, males, with, larger, antlers, tend, to, be, more, aggressive, and, dominant, over, others, antlers, can, be, an, honest, signal, of, genetic, quality, males, with, larger, antlers, relative, to, body, size, tend, to, have, increased, resistance, to, pathogens, and, higher, reproductive, capacity, in, elk, in, yellowstone, national, park, antlers, also, provide, protection, against, predation, by, wolves, homology, of, tines, that, is, the, branching, structure, of, antlers, among, species, have, been, discussed, before, the, 1900s, recently, a, new, method, to, describe, the, branching, structure, of, antlers, and, determining, homology, of, tines, was, developed, most, deer, bear, 32, teeth, the, corresponding, dental, formula, is, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, the, elk, and, the, reindeer, may, be, exceptions, as, they, may, retain, their, upper, canines, and, thus, have, 34, teeth, dental, formula, 0, 1, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, the, chinese, water, deer, tufted, deer, and, muntjac, have, enlarged, upper, canine, teeth, forming, sharp, tusks, while, other, species, often, lack, upper, canines, altogether, the, cheek, teeth, of, deer, have, crescent, ridges, of, enamel, which, enable, them, to, grind, a, wide, variety, of, vegetation, the, teeth, of, deer, are, adapted, to, feeding, on, vegetation, and, like, other, ruminants, they, lack, upper, incisors, instead, having, a, tough, pad, at, the, front, of, their, upper, jaw, deer, are, browsers, and, feed, primarily, on, foliage, of, grasses, sedges, forbs, shrubs, and, trees, secondarily, on, lichens, in, northern, latitudes, during, winter, they, have, small, unspecialized, stomachs, by, ruminant, standards, and, high, nutrition, requirements, rather, than, eating, and, digesting, vast, quantities, of, low, grade, fibrous, food, as, for, example, sheep, and, cattle, do, deer, select, easily, digestible, shoots, young, leaves, fresh, grasses, soft, twigs, fruit, fungi, and, lichens, the, low, fibered, food, after, minimal, fermentation, and, shredding, passes, rapidly, through, the, alimentary, canal, the, deer, require, a, large, amount, of, minerals, such, as, calcium, and, phosphate, in, order, to, support, antler, growth, and, this, further, necessitates, a, nutrient, rich, diet, there, are, some, reports, of, deer, engaging, in, carnivorous, activity, such, as, eating, dead, alewives, along, lakeshores, or, depredating, the, nests, of, northern, bobwhites, nearly, all, cervids, are, so, called, uniparental, species, the, young, known, in, most, species, as, fawns, are, only, cared, for, by, the, mother, most, often, called, a, doe, a, doe, generally, has, one, or, two, fawns, at, a, time, triplets, while, not, unknown, are, uncommon, mating, season, typically, begins, in, later, august, and, lasts, until, december, some, species, mate, until, early, march, the, gestation, period, is, anywhere, up, to, ten, months, for, the, european, roe, deer, most, fawns, are, born, with, their, fur, covered, with, white, spots, though, in, many, species, they, lose, these, spots, by, the, end, of, their, first, winter, in, the, first, twenty, minutes, of, a, fawn, s, life, the, fawn, begins, to, take, its, first, steps, its, mother, licks, it, clean, until, it, is, almost, free, of, scent, so, predators, will, not, find, it, its, mother, leaves, often, to, graze, and, the, fawn, does, not, like, to, be, left, behind, sometimes, its, mother, must, gently, push, it, down, with, her, foot, the, fawn, stays, hidden, in, the, grass, for, one, week, until, it, is, strong, enough, to, walk, with, its, mother, the, fawn, and, its, mother, stay, together, for, about, one, year, a, male, usually, leaves, and, never, sees, his, mother, again, but, females, sometimes, come, back, with, their, own, fawns, and, form, small, herds, in, some, areas, of, the, uk, deer, especially, fallow, deer, due, to, their, gregarious, behaviour, have, been, implicated, as, a, possible, reservoir, for, transmission, of, bovine, tuberculosis, a, disease, which, in, the, uk, in, 2005, cost, 90, million, in, attempts, to, eradicate, in, new, zealand, deer, are, thought, to, be, important, as, vectors, picking, up, m, bovis, in, areas, where, brushtail, possums, trichosurus, vulpecula, are, infected, and, transferring, it, to, previously, uninfected, possums, when, their, carcasses, are, scavenged, elsewhere, the, white, tailed, deer, odocoileus, virginianus, has, been, confirmed, as, the, sole, maintenance, host, in, the, michigan, outbreak, of, bovine, tuberculosis, which, remains, a, significant, barrier, to, the, us, nationwide, eradication, of, the, disease, in, livestock, moose, and, deer, can, carry, rabies, docile, moose, may, suffer, from, brain, worm, a, helminth, which, drills, holes, through, the, brain, in, its, search, for, a, suitable, place, to, lay, its, eggs, a, government, biologist, states, that, they, move, around, looking, for, the, right, spot, and, never, really, find, it, deer, appear, to, be, immune, to, this, parasite, it, passes, through, the, digestive, system, and, is, excreted, in, the, feces, the, parasite, is, not, screened, by, the, moose, intestine, and, passes, into, the, brain, where, damage, is, done, that, is, externally, apparent, both, in, behaviour, and, in, gait, deer, elk, and, moose, in, north, america, may, suffer, from, chronic, wasting, disease, which, was, identified, at, a, colorado, laboratory, in, the, 1960s, and, is, believed, to, be, a, prion, disease, out, of, an, abundance, of, caution, hunters, are, advised, to, avoid, contact, with, specified, risk, material, srm, such, as, the, brain, spinal, column, or, lymph, nodes, deboning, the, meat, when, butchering, and, sanitizing, the, knives, and, other, tools, used, to, butcher, are, amongst, other, government, recommendations, deer, are, believed, to, have, evolved, from, antlerless, tusked, ancestors, that, resembled, modern, duikers, and, diminutive, deer, in, the, early, eocene, and, gradually, developed, into, the, first, antlered, cervoids, the, superfamily, of, cervids, and, related, extinct, families, in, the, miocene, eventually, with, the, development, of, antlers, the, tusks, as, well, as, the, upper, incisors, disappeared, thus, evolution, of, deer, took, nearly, 30, million, years, biologist, valerius, geist, suggests, evolution, to, have, occurred, in, stages, there, are, not, many, prominent, fossils, to, trace, this, evolution, but, only, fragments, of, skeletons, and, antlers, that, might, be, easily, confused, with, false, antlers, of, non, cervid, species, the, ruminants, ancestors, of, the, cervidae, are, believed, to, have, evolved, from, diacodexis, the, earliest, known, artiodactyl, even, toed, ungulate, 50, 55, mya, in, the, eocene, diacodexis, nearly, the, size, of, a, rabbit, featured, the, talus, bone, characteristic, of, all, modern, even, toed, ungulates, this, ancestor, and, its, relatives, occurred, throughout, north, america, and, eurasia, but, were, on, the, decline, by, at, least, 46, mya, analysis, of, a, nearly, complete, skeleton, of, diacodexis, discovered, in, 1982, gave, rise, to, speculation, that, this, ancestor, could, be, closer, to, the, non, ruminants, than, the, ruminants, andromeryx, is, another, prominent, prehistoric, ruminant, but, appears, to, be, closer, to, the, tragulids, the, formation, of, the, himalayas, and, the, alps, brought, about, significant, geographic, changes, this, was, the, chief, reason, behind, the, extensive, diversification, of, deer, like, forms, and, the, emergence, of, cervids, from, the, oligocene, to, the, early, pliocene, the, latter, half, of, the, oligocene, 28, 34, mya, saw, the, appearance, of, the, european, eumeryx, and, the, north, american, leptomeryx, the, latter, resembled, modern, day, bovids, and, cervids, in, dental, morphology, for, instance, it, had, brachyodont, molars, while, the, former, was, more, advanced, other, deer, like, forms, included, the, north, american, blastomeryx, and, the, european, dremotherium, these, sabre, toothed, animals, are, believed, to, have, been, the, direct, ancestors, of, all, modern, antlered, deer, though, they, themselves, lacked, antlers, another, contemporaneous, form, was, the, four, horned, protoceratid, protoceras, that, was, replaced, by, syndyoceras, in, the, miocene, these, animals, were, unique, in, having, a, horn, on, the, nose, late, eocene, fossils, dated, approximately, 35, million, years, ago, which, were, found, in, north, america, show, that, syndyoceras, had, bony, skull, outgrowths, that, resembled, non, deciduous, antlers, fossil, evidence, suggests, that, the, earliest, members, of, the, superfamily, cervoidea, appeared, in, eurasia, in, the, miocene, dicrocerus, euprox, and, heteroprox, were, probably, the, first, antlered, cervids, dicrocerus, featured, single, forked, antlers, that, were, shed, regularly, stephanocemas, had, more, developed, and, diffuse, crowned, antlers, procervulus, palaeomerycidae, also, had, antlers, that, were, not, shed, contemporary, forms, such, as, the, merycodontines, eventually, gave, rise, to, the, modern, pronghorn, the, cervinae, emerged, as, the, first, group, of, extant, cervids, around, 7, 9, mya, during, the, late, miocene, in, central, asia, the, tribe, muntiacini, made, its, appearance, as, muntiacus, leilaoensis, around, 7, 8, mya, the, early, muntjacs, varied, in, size, as, small, as, hares, or, as, large, as, fallow, deer, they, had, tusks, for, fighting, and, antlers, for, defence, capreolinae, followed, soon, after, alceini, appeared, 6, 4, 8, 4, mya, around, this, period, the, tethys, ocean, disappeared, to, give, way, to, vast, stretches, of, grassland, these, provided, the, deer, with, abundant, protein, rich, vegetation, that, led, to, the, development, of, ornamental, antlers, and, allowed, populations, to, flourish, and, colonise, areas, as, antlers, had, become, pronounced, the, canines, were, either, lost, or, became, poorly, represented, as, in, elk, probably, because, diet, was, no, longer, browse, dominated, and, antlers, were, better, display, organs, in, muntjac, and, tufted, deer, the, antlers, as, well, as, the, canines, are, small, the, tragulids, have, long, canines, to, this, day, with, the, onset, of, the, pliocene, the, global, climate, became, cooler, a, fall, in, the, sea, level, led, to, massive, glaciation, consequently, grasslands, abounded, in, nutritious, forage, thus, a, new, spurt, in, deer, populations, ensued, the, oldest, member, of, cervini, cervocerus, novorossiae, appeared, around, the, transition, from, miocene, to, pliocene, 4, 2, 6, mya, in, eurasia, cervine, fossils, from, early, pliocene, to, as, late, as, the, pleistocene, have, been, excavated, in, china, and, the, himalayas, while, cervus, and, dama, appeared, nearly, 3, mya, axis, emerged, during, the, late, pliocene, pleistocene, the, tribes, capreolini, and, rangiferini, appeared, around, 4, 7, mya, around, 5, mya, the, rangiferina, bretzia, and, eocoileus, were, the, first, cervids, to, reach, north, america, this, implies, the, bering, strait, could, be, crossed, during, the, late, miocene, pliocene, this, appears, highly, probable, as, the, camelids, migrated, into, asia, from, north, america, around, the, same, time, deer, invaded, south, america, in, the, late, pliocene, 2, 5, 3, mya, as, part, of, the, great, american, interchange, thanks, to, the, recently, formed, isthmus, of, panama, and, emerged, successful, due, to, the, small, number, of, competing, ruminants, in, the, continent, large, deer, with, impressive, antlers, evolved, during, the, early, pleistocene, probably, as, a, result, of, abundant, resources, to, drive, evolution, the, early, pleistocene, cervid, eucladoceros, was, comparable, in, size, to, the, modern, elk, megaloceros, pliocene, pleistocene, featured, the, irish, elk, m, giganteus, one, of, the, largest, known, cervids, the, irish, elk, reached, 2, metres, 6, 1, 2, ft, at, the, shoulder, and, had, heavy, antlers, that, spanned, 3, 6, metres, 11, ft, 10, in, from, tip, to, tip, these, large, animals, were, traditionally, thought, to, have, faced, extinction, due, to, conflict, between, sexual, selection, for, large, antlers, and, body, and, natural, selection, for, a, smaller, form, but, a, combination, of, anthropogenic, and, climatic, pressures, is, now, thought, to, be, the, most, likely, culprit, meanwhile, the, moose, and, reindeer, radiated, into, north, america, from, siberia, deer, constitute, the, artiodactyl, family, cervidae, this, family, was, first, described, by, german, zoologist, georg, august, goldfuss, in, handbuch, der, zoologie, 1820, three, subfamilies, were, recognised, capreolinae, first, described, by, the, english, zoologist, joshua, brookes, in, 1828, cervinae, described, by, goldfuss, and, hydropotinae, first, described, by, french, zoologist, douard, louis, trouessart, in, 1898, other, attempts, at, the, classification, of, deer, have, been, based, on, morphological, and, genetic, differences, the, anglo, irish, naturalist, victor, brooke, suggested, in, 1878, that, deer, could, be, bifurcated, into, two, classes, on, the, according, to, the, features, of, the, second, and, fifth, metacarpal, bones, of, their, forelimbs, plesiometacarpalia, most, old, world, deer, and, telemetacarpalia, most, new, world, deer, he, treated, the, musk, deer, as, a, cervid, placing, it, under, telemetacarpalia, while, the, telemetacarpal, deer, showed, only, those, elements, located, far, from, the, joint, the, plesiometacarpal, deer, retained, the, elements, closer, to, the, joint, as, well, differentiation, on, the, basis, of, diploid, number, of, chromosomes, in, the, late, 20th, century, has, been, flawed, by, several, inconsistencies, in, 1987, the, zoologists, colin, groves, and, peter, grubb, identified, three, subfamilies, cervinae, hydropotinae, and, odocoileinae, they, noted, that, the, hydropotines, lack, antlers, and, the, other, two, subfamilies, differ, in, their, skeletal, morphology, they, reverted, from, this, classification, in, 2000, molecular, phylogenetic, analyses, since, the, latter, half, of, the, 2000s, all, show, that, hydropotes, is, a, sister, taxon, of, capreolus, and, hydropotinae, became, outdated, subfamily, until, 2003, it, was, understood, that, the, family, moschidae, musk, deer, was, sister, to, cervidae, then, a, phylogenetic, study, by, alexandre, hassanin, of, national, museum, of, natural, history, france, and, colleagues, based, on, mitochondrial, and, nuclear, analyses, revealed, that, moschidae, and, bovidae, form, a, clade, sister, to, cervidae, according, to, the, study, cervidae, diverged, from, the, bovidae, moschidae, clade, 27, to, 28, million, years, ago, the, following, cladogram, is, based, on, the, 2003, study, tragulidae, antilocapridae, giraffidae, cervidae, bovidae, moschidae, a, 2006, phylogenetic, study, of, the, internal, relationships, in, cervidae, by, cl, ment, gilbert, and, colleagues, divided, the, family, into, two, major, clades, capreolinae, telemetacarpal, or, new, world, deer, and, cervinae, plesiometacarpal, or, old, world, deer, studies, in, the, late, 20th, century, suggested, a, similar, bifurcation, in, the, family, this, as, well, as, previous, studies, support, monophyly, in, cervinae, while, capreolinae, appears, paraphyletic, the, 2006, study, identified, two, lineages, in, cervinae, cervini, comprising, the, genera, axis, cervus, dama, and, rucervus, and, muntiacini, muntiacus, and, elaphodus, capreolinae, featured, three, lineages, alceini, alces, species, capreolini, capreolus, and, the, subfamily, hydropotinae, and, rangiferini, blastocerus, hippocamelus, mazama, odocoileus, pudu, and, rangifer, species, the, following, cladogram, is, based, on, the,

china, deer, continued, to, be, a, main, source, of, food, for, millennia, even, after, people, began, farming, and, it, is, possible, that, sika, and, other, deer, benefited, from, the, frequently, abandoned, field, sites, deer, had, a, central, role, in, the, ancient, art, culture, and, mythology, of, various, peoples, including, the, hittites, the, ancient, egyptians, the, celts, the, ancient, greeks, and, certain, east, asian, cultures, for, instance, the, stag, hunt, mosaic, of, ancient, pella, under, the, kingdom, of, macedonia, 4th, century, bc, possibly, depicts, alexander, the, great,

century, by, james, macpherson, creator, of, ossianic, poetry, deer, have, been, an, integral, part, of, fables, and, other, literary, works, since, the, inception, of, writing, stags, were, used, as, symbols, in, the, latter, sumerian, writings, for, instance, the, boat, of, sumerian, god, enki, is, named, the, stag, of, azbu, there, are, several, mentions, of, the, animal, in, the, rigveda, as,
