rabbits, are, small, mammals, in, the, family, leporidae, which, also, includes, the, hares, which, is, in, the, order, lagomorpha, which, also, includes, pikas, the, european, rabbit, oryctolagus, cuniculus, is, the, ancestor, of, the, world, s, hundreds, of, breeds, of, domestic, rabbit, and, has, been, introduced, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, it, is, familiar, throughout, the, world, as, a, wild, prey, animal, a, domesticated, form, of, livestock, and, a, pet, having, a, widespread, effect, on, ecologies, and, cultures, sylvilagus, includes, 13, wild, rabbit, species, among, them, the, seven, types, of, cottontail, wild, rabbits, not, included, in, oryctolagus, and, sylvilagus, include, several, species, of, limited, distribution, including, the, pygmy, rabbit, volcano, rabbit, and, sumatran, striped, rabbit, rabbits, are, a, paraphyletic, grouping, and, do, not, constitute, a, clade, as, hares, belonging, to, the, genus, lepus, are, nested, within, the, leporidae, clade, and, are, not, included, in, rabbits, although, once, considered, rodents, lagomorphs, diverged, earlier, and, have, a, number, of, traits, rodents, lack, including, two, extra, incisors, similarities, between, rabbits, and, rodents, are, attributed, to, convergent, evolution, rabbit, physiology, is, suited, to, escaping, predators, and, surviving, in, various, habitats, living, either, alone, or, in, groups, that, may, live, in, burrows, as, prey, animals, rabbits, are, constantly, aware, of, their, surroundings, having, a, wide, field, of, vision, and, ears, with, high, surface, area, to, detect, potential, predators, the, ears, of, a, rabbit, are, essential, for, thermoregulation, and, contain, a, high, density, of, blood, vessels, the, bone, structure, of, a, rabbit, s, hind, legs, which, is, longer, than, that, of, the, fore, legs, allows, for, quick, hopping, which, is, beneficial, for, escaping, predators, and, can, provide, powerful, kicks, if, captured, rabbits, are, typically, nocturnal, and, often, sleep, with, their, eyes, open, they, reproduce, quickly, having, short, pregnancies, large, litters, of, four, to, twelve, kits, and, no, particular, mating, season, however, the, mortality, rate, of, rabbit, embryos, is, high, and, there, exist, several, widespread, diseases, that, affect, rabbits, such, as, rabbit, hemorrhagic, disease, and, myxomatosis, in, some, regions, especially, australia, rabbits, have, caused, ecological, problems, and, are, regarded, as, a, pest, humans, have, used, rabbits, as, livestock, since, at, least, the, first, century, bc, in, ancient, rome, raising, them, for, their, meat, fur, and, wool, the, various, breeds, of, the, european, rabbit, have, been, developed, to, suit, each, of, these, products, the, practice, of, raising, and, breeding, rabbits, as, livestock, is, known, as, cuniculture, rabbits, are, seen, in, human, culture, globally, appearing, as, a, symbol, of, fertility, cunning, and, innocence, in, major, religions, historic, and, contemporary, art, a, male, rabbit, is, called, a, buck, a, female, is, called, a, doe, an, older, term, for, an, adult, rabbit, used, until, the, 18th, century, is, coney, derived, ultimately, from, the, latin, cuniculus, while, rabbit, once, referred, only, to, the, young, animals, another, term, for, a, young, rabbit, is, bunny, though, this, term, is, often, applied, informally, particularly, by, children, to, rabbits, generally, especially, domestic, ones, more, recently, the, term, kit, or, kitten, has, been, used, to, refer, to, a, young, rabbit, a, group, of, rabbits, is, known, as, a, colony, or, nest, or, occasionally, a, warren, though, this, more, commonly, refers, to, where, the, rabbits, live, a, group, of, baby, rabbits, produced, from, a, single, mating, is, referred, to, as, a, litter, and, a, group, of, domestic, rabbits, living, together, is, sometimes, called, a, herd, the, word, rabbit, itself, derives, from, the, middle, english, rabet, a, borrowing, from, the, walloon, rob, te, which, was, a, diminutive, of, the, french, or, middle, dutch, robbe, rabbits, and, hares, were, formerly, classified, in, the, order, rodentia, rodent, until, 1912, when, they, were, moved, into, a, new, order, lagomorpha, which, also, includes, pikas, below, are, some, of, the, genera, and, species, of, the, rabbit, the, term, rabbit, is, typically, used, for, all, leporidae, species, excluding, the, genus, lepus, members, of, that, genus, are, known, as, hares, or, jackrabbits, lepus, species, are, precocial, born, relatively, mature, and, mobile, with, hair, and, good, vision, while, rabbit, species, are, altricial, born, hairless, and, blind, hares, are, also, generally, larger, than, rabbits, and, have, longer, pregnancies, hares, and, some, rabbits, live, a, relatively, solitary, life, in, a, simple, nest, above, the, ground, while, other, rabbits, live, in, social, groups, in, burrows, which, are, grouped, together, to, form, warrens, rabbits, and, hares, have, historically, not, occupied, the, same, locations, and, only, became, sympatric, relatively, recently, historic, accounts, describe, antagonistic, relationships, between, rabbits, and, hares, specifically, between, the, european, hare, and, european, or, cottontail, rabbits, but, scientific, literature, since, 1956, has, found, no, evidence, of, aggression, or, undue, competition, between, rabbits, and, hares, when, they, appear, in, the, same, habitat, rabbits, and, hares, can, co, exist, on, similar, diets, descendants, of, the, european, rabbit, are, commonly, bred, as, livestock, and, kept, as, pets, whereas, no, hares, have, been, domesticated, the, breed, called, the, belgian, hare, is, actually, a, domestic, rabbit, which, has, been, selectively, bred, to, resemble, a, hare, rabbits, have, long, been, domesticated, the, european, rabbit, has, been, widely, kept, as, livestock, starting, in, ancient, rome, from, at, least, the, first, century, bc, selective, breeding, which, began, in, the, middle, ages, has, generated, a, wide, variety, of, rabbit, breeds, of, which, many, since, the, early, 19th, century, are, also, kept, as, pets, some, strains, of, rabbit, have, been, bred, specifically, as, research, subjects, such, as, the, new, zealand, white, as, livestock, rabbits, are, bred, for, their, meat, and, fur, the, earliest, breeds, were, important, sources, of, meat, and, so, were, bred, to, be, larger, than, wild, rabbits, at, younger, ages, but, domestic, rabbits, in, modern, times, range, in, size, from, dwarf, to, giant, rabbit, fur, produced, as, a, byproduct, of, meat, production, but, occasionally, selected, for, as, in, the, case, of, the, rex, rabbit, can, be, found, in, a, broad, range, of, coat, colors, and, patterns, some, of, which, are, produced, via, dyeing, some, breeds, are, raised, for, their, wool, such, as, the, angora, rabbit, breeds, their, fur, is, sheared, combed, or, plucked, and, the, fibers, are, spun, into, yarn, because, the, rabbit, s, epiglottis, is, engaged, over, the, soft, palate, except, when, swallowing, the, rabbit, is, an, obligate, nasal, breather, rabbits, have, two, sets, of, incisor, teeth, one, behind, the, other, this, way, they, can, be, distinguished, from, rodents, with, which, they, are, often, confused, another, difference, is, that, for, rabbits, all, of, their, teeth, continue, to, grow, where, as, for, most, rodents, only, their, incisors, continue, to, grow, carl, linnaeus, originally, grouped, rabbits, and, rodents, under, the, class, glires, later, they, were, separated, as, the, scientific, consensus, is, that, many, of, their, similarities, were, a, result, of, convergent, evolution, recent, dna, analysis, and, the, discovery, of, a, common, ancestor, has, supported, the, view, that, they, share, a, common, lineage, so, rabbits, and, rodents, are, now, often, grouped, together, in, the, superorder, glires, since, speed, and, agility, are, a, rabbit, s, main, defenses, against, predators, including, the, swift, fox, rabbits, have, large, hind, leg, bones, and, well, developed, musculature, though, plantigrade, at, rest, rabbits, are, on, their, toes, while, running, assuming, a, more, digitigrade, posture, rabbits, use, their, strong, claws, for, digging, and, along, with, their, teeth, for, defense, each, front, foot, has, four, toes, plus, a, dewclaw, each, hind, foot, has, four, toes, but, no, dewclaw, most, wild, rabbits, especially, compared, to, hares, have, relatively, full, egg, shaped, bodies, the, soft, coat, of, the, wild, rabbit, is, agouti, in, coloration, or, rarely, melanistic, which, aids, in, camouflage, the, tail, of, the, rabbit, with, the, exception, of, the, cottontail, species, is, dark, on, top, and, white, below, cottontails, have, white, on, the, top, of, their, tails, as, a, result, of, the, position, of, the, eyes, in, its, skull, the, rabbit, has, a, field, of, vision, that, encompasses, nearly, 360, degrees, with, just, a, small, blind, spot, at, the, bridge, of, the, nose, the, anatomy, of, rabbits, hind, limbs, is, structurally, similar, to, that, of, other, land, mammals, and, contributes, to, their, specialized, form, of, locomotion, the, bones, of, the, hind, limbs, consist, of, long, bones, the, femur, tibia, fibula, and, phalanges, as, well, as, short, bones, the, tarsals, these, bones, are, created, through, endochondral, ossification, during, development, like, most, land, mammals, the, round, head, of, the, femur, articulates, with, the, acetabulum, of, the, os, coxae, the, femur, articulates, with, the, tibia, but, not, the, fibula, which, is, fused, to, the, tibia, the, tibia, and, fibula, articulate, with, the, tarsals, of, the, pes, commonly, called, the, foot, the, hind, limbs, of, the, rabbit, are, longer, than, the, front, limbs, this, allows, them, to, produce, their, hopping, form, of, locomotion, longer, hind, limbs, are, more, capable, of, producing, faster, speeds, hares, which, have, longer, legs, than, cottontail, rabbits, are, able, to, move, considerably, faster, rabbits, stay, just, on, their, toes, when, moving, this, is, called, digitigrade, locomotion, the, hind, feet, have, four, long, toes, that, allow, for, this, and, are, webbed, to, prevent, them, from, spreading, when, hopping, rabbits, do, not, have, paw, pads, on, their, feet, like, most, other, animals, that, use, digitigrade, locomotion, instead, they, have, coarse, compressed, hair, that, offers, protection, rabbits, have, muscled, hind, legs, that, allow, for, maximum, force, maneuverability, and, acceleration, that, is, divided, into, three, main, parts, foot, thigh, and, leg, the, hind, limbs, of, a, rabbit, are, an, exaggerated, feature, they, are, much, longer, than, the, forelimbs, providing, more, force, rabbits, run, on, their, toes, to, gain, the, optimal, stride, during, locomotion, the, force, put, out, by, the, hind, limbs, is, contributed, by, both, the, structural, anatomy, of, the, fusion, tibia, and, fibula, and, muscular, features, bone, formation, and, removal, from, a, cellular, standpoint, is, directly, correlated, to, hind, limb, muscles, action, pressure, from, muscles, creates, force, that, is, then, distributed, through, the, skeletal, structures, rabbits, that, generate, less, force, putting, less, stress, on, bones, are, more, prone, to, osteoporosis, due, to, bone, rarefaction, in, rabbits, the, more, fibers, in, a, muscle, the, more, resistant, to, fatigue, for, example, hares, have, a, greater, resistance, to, fatigue, than, cottontails, the, muscles, of, rabbit, s, hind, limbs, can, be, classified, into, four, main, categories, hamstrings, quadriceps, dorsiflexors, or, plantar, flexors, the, quadriceps, muscles, are, in, charge, of, force, production, when, jumping, complementing, these, muscles, are, the, hamstrings, which, aid, in, short, bursts, of, action, these, muscles, play, off, of, one, another, in, the, same, way, as, the, plantar, flexors, and, dorsiflexors, contributing, to, the, generation, and, actions, associated, with, force, within, the, order, of, lagomorphs, the, ears, are, used, to, detect, and, avoid, predators, in, the, family, leporidae, the, ears, are, typically, longer, than, they, are, wide, for, example, in, black, tailed, jackrabbits, their, long, ears, cover, a, greater, surface, area, relative, to, their, body, size, which, allows, them, to, detect, predators, from, far, away, in, contrast, with, cottontail, rabbits, their, ears, are, smaller, and, shorter, requiring, that, predators, be, closer, before, they, can, detect, them, and, flee, evolution, has, favored, rabbits, with, shorter, ears, so, the, larger, surface, area, does, not, cause, them, to, lose, heat, in, more, temperate, regions, the, opposite, can, be, seen, in, rabbits, that, live, in, hotter, climates, possessing, longer, ears, with, a, larger, surface, area, helps, with, dispersion, of, heat, since, sound, travels, less, well, in, arid, as, opposed, to, cooler, air, longer, ears, may, aid, the, organism, in, detecting, predators, sooner, rather, than, later, in, warmer, temperatures, rabbits, are, characterized, by, shorter, ears, than, hares, rabbits, ears, are, an, important, structure, to, aid, thermoregulation, as, well, as, in, detecting, predators, due, to, the, way, the, outer, middle, and, inner, ear, muscles, coordinate, with, one, another, the, ear, muscles, also, aid, in, maintaining, balance, and, movement, when, fleeing, predators, the, auricle, also, known, as, the, pinna, is, a, rabbit, s, outer, ear, the, rabbit, s, pinnae, represent, a, fair, part, of, the, body, surface, area, it, is, theorized, that, the, ears, aid, in, dispersion, of, heat, at, temperatures, above, 30, c, 86, f, with, rabbits, in, warmer, climates, having, longer, pinnae, due, to, this, another, theory, is, that, the, ears, function, as, shock, absorbers, that, could, aid, and, stabilize, rabbits, vision, when, fleeing, predators, but, this, has, typically, only, been, seen, in, hares, the, rest, of, the, outer, ear, has, bent, canals, that, lead, to, the, eardrum, or, tympanic, membrane, the, middle, ear, separated, by, the, outer, eardrum, in, the, back, of, the, rabbit, s, skull, contains, three, bones, the, hammer, anvil, and, stirrup, collectively, called, ossicles, which, act, to, decrease, sound, before, it, hits, the, inner, ear, in, general, the, ossicles, act, as, a, barrier, to, the, inner, ear, for, sound, energy, inner, ear, fluid, called, endolymph, receives, the, sound, energy, after, receiving, the, energy, the, inner, ear, comprises, two, parts, the, cochlea, that, uses, sound, waves, from, the, ossicles, and, the, vestibular, apparatus, that, manages, the, rabbit, s, position, in, regard, to, movement, within, the, cochlea, a, basilar, membrane, contains, sensory, hair, structures, that, send, nerve, signals, to, the, brain, allowing, it, to, recognize, different, sound, frequencies, within, the, vestibular, apparatus, three, semicircular, canals, help, detect, angular, motion, a, dewlap, is, a, longitudinal, flap, of, skin, or, similar, flesh, that, hangs, beneath, the, lower, jaw, or, neck, it, is, a, secondary, sex, characteristic, in, rabbits, caused, by, the, presence, of, female, sex, hormones, they, develop, with, puberty, a, female, rabbit, who, has, been, neutered, before, reaching, sexual, maturity, will, not, develop, a, dewlap, and, even, if, a, doe, is, neutered, after, developing, a, dewlap, the, dewlap, will, gradually, disappear, over, several, months, this, also, aligns, with, the, results, of, injecting, male, rabbits, with, female, sex, hormones, specifically, the, ones, from, pregnant, women, s, urine, the, male, rabbits, developed, dewlaps, which, then, gradually, disappeared, once, administration, had, ceased, this, is, not, the, process, of, the, rabbit, test, a, common, way, to, test, for, human, female, pregnancy, in, the, 20th, century, the, pregnancy, test, involved, dissecting, female, rabbits, after, injection, with, urine, to, see, if, their, ovaries, had, enlarged, while, it, is, unclear, exactly, what, function, a, dewlap, performs, pregnant, female, rabbits, will, pluck, fur, from, their, dewlaps, shortly, before, giving, birth, to, line, a, nest, for, their, young, thermoregulation, is, the, process, that, an, organism, uses, to, maintain, an, optimal, body, temperature, independent, of, external, conditions, this, process, is, carried, out, by, the, pinnae, which, takes, up, most, of, the, rabbit, s, body, surface, and, contain, a, vascular, network, and, arteriovenous, shunts, in, a, rabbit, the, optimal, body, temperature, is, around, 38, 5, 40, 0, c, 101, 3, 104, 0, f, if, their, body, temperature, exceeds, or, does, not, meet, this, optimal, temperature, the, rabbit, must, return, to, homeostasis, homeostasis, of, body, temperature, is, maintained, by, the, use, of, their, large, highly, vascularized, ears, that, are, able, to, change, the, amount, of, blood, flow, that, passes, through, the, ears, the, rabbit, s, nasal, cavity, lies, dorsal, to, the, oral, cavity, and, the, two, compartments, are, separated, by, the, hard, and, soft, palate, the, nasal, cavity, itself, is, separated, into, a, left, and, right, side, by, a, cartilage, barrier, and, it, is, covered, in, fine, hairs, that, trap, dust, before, it, can, enter, the, respiratory, tract, as, the, rabbit, breathes, air, flows, in, through, the, nostrils, along, the, alar, folds, from, there, the, air, moves, into, the, nasal, cavity, also, known, as, the, nasopharynx, down, through, the, trachea, through, the, larynx, and, into, the, lungs, the, larynx, functions, as, the, rabbit, s, voice, box, which, enables, it, to, produce, a, wide, variety, of, sounds, the, trachea, is, a, long, tube, embedded, with, cartilaginous, rings, that, prevent, the, tube, from, collapsing, as, air, moves, in, and, out, of, the, lungs, the, trachea, then, splits, into, a, left, and, right, bronchus, which, meet, the, lungs, at, a, structure, called, the, hilum, from, there, the, bronchi, split, into, progressively, more, narrow, and, numerous, branches, the, bronchi, branch, into, bronchioles, into, respiratory, bronchioles, and, ultimately, terminate, at, the, alveolar, ducts, the, branching, that, is, typically, found, in, rabbit, lungs, is, a, clear, example, of, monopodial, branching, in, which, smaller, branches, divide, out, laterally, from, a, larger, central, branch, the, structure, of, the, rabbit, s, nasal, and, oral, cavities, necessitates, breathing, through, the, nose, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, the, epiglottis, is, fixed, to, the, backmost, portion, of, the, soft, palate, within, the, oral, cavity, a, layer, of, tissue, sits, over, the, opening, of, the, glottis, which, blocks, airflow, from, the, oral, cavity, to, the, trachea, the, epiglottis, functions, to, prevent, the, rabbit, from, aspirating, on, its, food, further, the, presence, of, a, soft, and, hard, palate, allow, the, rabbit, to, breathe, through, its, nose, while, it, feeds, rabbits, lungs, are, divided, into, four, lobes, the, cranial, middle, caudal, and, accessory, lobes, the, right, lung, is, made, up, of, all, four, lobes, while, the, left, lung, only, has, two, the, cranial, and, caudal, lobes, to, provide, space, for, the, heart, the, left, cranial, lobe, of, the, lungs, is, significantly, smaller, than, that, of, the, right, the, diaphragm, is, a, muscular, structure, that, lies, caudal, to, the, lungs, and, contracts, to, facilitate, respiration, rabbits, are, strict, herbivores, and, are, suited, to, a, diet, high, in, fiber, mostly, in, the, form, of, cellulose, they, will, typically, graze, grass, upon, waking, up, and, emerging, from, a, burrow, and, will, move, on, to, consume, vegetation, and, other, plants, throughout, the, waking, period, rabbits, have, been, known, to, eat, a, wide, variety, of, plants, including, tree, leaves, and, fruits, though, consumption, of, fruit, and, lower, fiber, foods, is, more, common, with, pet, rabbits, easily, digestible, food, is, processed, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, and, expelled, as, regular, feces, to, get, nutrients, out, of, hard, to, digest, fiber, rabbits, ferment, fiber, in, the, cecum, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, and, then, expel, the, contents, as, cecotropes, which, are, reingested, cecotrophy, the, cecotropes, are, then, absorbed, in, the, small, intestine, to, use, the, nutrients, soft, cecotropes, are, usually, consumed, during, periods, of, rest, in, underground, burrows, because, rabbits, cannot, vomit, if, buildup, occurs, within, the, intestines, due, often, to, a, diet, with, insufficient, fibre, intestinal, blockage, can, occur, the, adult, male, reproductive, system, forms, the, same, as, most, mammals, with, the, seminiferous, tubular, compartment, containing, the, sertoli, cells, and, an, adluminal, compartment, that, contains, the, leydig, cells, the, leydig, cells, produce, testosterone, which, maintains, libido, and, creates, secondary, sex, characteristics, such, as, the, genital, tubercle, and, penis, the, sertoli, cells, triggers, the, production, of, anti, m, llerian, duct, hormone, which, absorbs, the, m, llerian, duct, in, an, adult, male, rabbit, the, sheath, of, the, penis, is, cylinder, like, and, can, be, extruded, as, early, as, two, months, of, age, the, scrotal, sacs, lay, lateral, to, the, penis, and, contain, epididymal, fat, pads, which, protect, the, testes, between, 10, and, 14, weeks, the, testes, descend, and, are, able, to, retract, into, the, pelvic, cavity, to, thermoregulate, furthermore, the, secondary, sex, characteristics, such, as, the, testes, are, complex, and, secrete, many, compounds, these, compounds, include, fructose, citric, acid, minerals, and, a, uniquely, high, amount, of, catalase, the, adult, female, reproductive, tract, is, bipartite, which, prevents, an, embryo, from, translocating, between, uteri, the, female, urethra, and, vagina, open, into, a, urogenital, sinus, with, a, single, urogenital, opening, the, two, uterine, horns, communicate, to, two, cervixes, and, forms, one, vaginal, canal, along, with, being, bipartite, the, female, rabbit, does, not, go, through, an, estrus, cycle, which, causes, mating, induced, ovulation, the, average, female, rabbit, becomes, sexually, mature, at, three, to, eight, months, of, age, and, can, conceive, at, any, time, of, the, year, for, the, duration, of, her, life, egg, and, sperm, production, can, begin, to, decline, after, three, years, during, mating, the, male, rabbit, will, insert, his, penis, into, the, female, from, behind, make, rapid, pelvic, thrusts, until, ejaculation, and, throw, himself, backward, off, the, female, copulation, lasts, only, 20, 40, seconds, the, rabbit, gestation, period, is, short, and, ranges, from, 28, to, 36, days, with, an, average, period, of, 31, days, a, longer, gestation, period, will, generally, yield, a, smaller, litter, while, shorter, gestation, periods, will, give, birth, to, a, larger, litter, the, size, of, a, single, litter, can, range, from, four, to, 12, kits, allowing, a, female, to, deliver, up, to, 60, new, kits, a, year, after, birth, the, female, can, become, pregnant, again, as, early, as, the, next, day, after, mating, in, some, species, hormonal, changes, will, cause, the, doe, to, begin, to, dig, a, burrow, for, her, nest, about, a, week, before, giving, birth, between, three, days, and, a, few, hours, before, giving, birth, another, series, of, hormonal, changes, will, cause, her, to, prepare, the, nest, structure, the, doe, will, first, gather, grass, for, a, structure, and, an, elevation, in, prolactin, shortly, before, birth, will, cause, her, fur, to, shed, that, the, doe, will, then, use, to, line, the, nest, providing, insulation, for, the, newborn, kits, the, mortality, rates, of, embryos, are, high, in, rabbits, and, can, be, due, to, infection, trauma, poor, nutrition, and, environmental, stress, so, a, high, fertility, rate, is, necessary, to, counter, this, rabbits, may, appear, to, be, crepuscular, but, their, natural, inclination, is, toward, nocturnal, activity, in, 2011, the, average, sleep, time, of, a, rabbit, in, captivity, was, calculated, at, 8, 4, hours, per, day, as, with, other, prey, animals, rabbits, often, sleep, with, their, eyes, open, so, that, sudden, movements, will, awaken, the, rabbit, to, respond, to, potential, danger, in, addition, to, being, at, risk, of, disease, from, common, pathogens, such, as, bordetella, bronchiseptica, and, escherichia, coli, rabbits, can, contract, the, virulent, species, specific, viruses, rabbit, hemorrhagic, disease, a, form, of, calicivirus, and, myxomatosis, myxomatosis, is, more, hazardous, to, pet, rabbits, as, wild, rabbits, often, have, some, immunity, among, the, parasites, that, infect, rabbits, are, tapeworms, such, as, taenia, serialis, external, parasites, including, fleas, and, mites, coccidia, species, encephalitozoon, cuniculi, and, toxoplasma, gondii, domesticated, rabbits, with, a, diet, lacking, in, high, fiber, sources, such, as, hay, and, grass, are, susceptible, to, potentially, lethal, gastrointestinal, stasis, rabbits, and, hares, are, almost, never, found, to, be, infected, with, rabies, and, have, not, been, known, to, transmit, rabies, to, humans, rabbit, immunity, has, significantly, diverged, from, other, tetrapods, in, the, manner, in, which, it, employs, immunoglobulin, light, chains, in, one, case, mccartney, francis, et, al, 1984, discovered, a, unique,
