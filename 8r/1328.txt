an, autopsy, also, referred, to, as, post, mortem, examination, obduction, necropsy, or, autopsia, cadaverum, is, a, surgical, procedure, that, consists, of, a, thorough, examination, of, a, corpse, by, dissection, to, determine, the, cause, mode, and, manner, of, death, or, the, exam, may, be, performed, to, evaluate, any, disease, or, injury, that, may, be, present, for, research, or, educational, purposes, the, term, necropsy, is, generally, used, for, non, human, animals, autopsies, are, usually, performed, by, a, specialized, medical, doctor, called, a, pathologist, only, a, small, portion, of, deaths, require, an, autopsy, to, be, performed, under, certain, circumstances, in, most, cases, a, medical, examiner, or, coroner, can, determine, the, cause, of, death, autopsies, are, performed, for, either, legal, or, medical, purposes, autopsies, can, be, performed, when, any, of, the, following, information, is, desired, for, example, a, forensic, autopsy, is, carried, out, when, the, cause, of, death, may, be, a, criminal, matter, while, a, clinical, or, academic, autopsy, is, performed, to, find, the, medical, cause, of, death, and, is, used, in, cases, of, unknown, or, uncertain, death, or, for, research, purposes, autopsies, can, be, further, classified, into, cases, where, an, external, examination, suffices, and, those, where, the, body, is, dissected, and, an, internal, examination, is, conducted, permission, from, next, of, kin, may, be, required, for, internal, autopsy, in, some, cases, once, an, internal, autopsy, is, complete, the, body, is, reconstituted, by, sewing, it, back, together, the, term, autopsy, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, autopsia, to, see, for, oneself, derived, from, autos, oneself, and, opsis, sight, view, the, word, has, been, in, use, since, around, the, 17th, century, the, term, post, mortem, derives, from, the, latin, post, after, and, mortem, death, it, was, first, recorded, in, 1734, the, term, necropsy, is, derived, from, the, greek, death, and, opsis, sight, view, the, principal, aims, of, an, autopsy, are, to, determine, the, cause, of, death, mode, of, death, manner, of, death, the, state, of, health, of, the, person, before, he, or, she, died, and, whether, any, medical, diagnosis, and, treatment, before, death, were, appropriate, in, most, western, countries, the, number, of, autopsies, performed, in, hospitals, has, been, decreasing, every, year, since, 1955, critics, including, pathologist, and, former, jama, editor, george, d, lundberg, have, charged, that, the, reduction, in, autopsies, is, negatively, affecting, the, care, delivered, in, hospitals, because, when, mistakes, result, in, death, they, are, often, not, investigated, and, lessons, therefore, remain, unlearned, when, a, person, has, permitted, an, autopsy, in, advance, of, their, death, autopsies, may, also, be, carried, out, for, the, purposes, of, teaching, or, medical, research, an, autopsy, is, usually, performed, in, cases, of, sudden, death, where, a, doctor, is, not, able, to, write, a, death, certificate, or, when, death, is, believed, to, result, from, an, unnatural, cause, these, examinations, are, performed, under, a, legal, authority, medical, examiner, coroner, or, procurator, fiscal, and, do, not, require, the, consent, of, relatives, of, the, deceased, the, most, extreme, example, is, the, examination, of, murder, victims, especially, when, medical, examiners, are, looking, for, signs, of, death, or, the, murder, method, such, as, bullet, wounds, and, exit, points, signs, of, strangulation, or, traces, of, poison, some, religions, including, judaism, and, islam, usually, discourage, the, performing, of, autopsies, on, their, adherents, organizations, such, as, zaka, in, israel, and, misaskim, in, the, united, states, generally, guide, families, on, how, to, ensure, that, an, unnecessary, autopsy, is, not, made, autopsies, are, used, in, clinical, medicine, to, identify, a, medical, error, or, a, previously, unnoticed, condition, that, may, endanger, the, living, such, as, infectious, diseases, or, exposure, to, hazardous, materials, a, study, that, focused, on, myocardial, infarction, heart, attack, as, a, cause, of, death, found, significant, errors, of, omission, and, commission, i, e, a, sizable, number, of, cases, ascribed, to, myocardial, infarctions, mis, were, not, mis, and, a, significant, number, of, non, mis, were, mis, a, systematic, review, of, studies, of, the, autopsy, calculated, that, in, about, 25, of, autopsies, a, major, diagnostic, error, will, be, revealed, however, this, rate, has, decreased, over, time, and, the, study, projects, that, in, a, contemporary, us, institution, 8, 4, to, 24, 4, of, autopsies, will, detect, major, diagnostic, errors, a, large, meta, analysis, suggested, that, approximately, one, third, of, death, certificates, are, incorrect, and, that, half, of, the, autopsies, performed, produced, findings, that, were, not, suspected, before, the, person, died, also, it, is, thought, that, over, one, fifth, of, unexpected, findings, can, only, be, diagnosed, histologically, i, e, by, biopsy, or, autopsy, and, that, approximately, one, quarter, of, unexpected, findings, or, 5, of, all, findings, are, major, and, can, similarly, only, be, diagnosed, from, tissue, one, study, found, that, out, of, 694, diagnoses, autopsies, revealed, 171, missed, diagnoses, including, 21, cancers, 12, strokes, 11, myocardial, infarctions, 10, pulmonary, emboli, and, 9, endocarditis, among, others, focusing, on, intubated, patients, one, study, found, abdominal, pathologic, conditions, abscesses, bowel, perforations, or, infarction, were, as, frequent, as, pulmonary, emboli, as, a, cause, of, class, i, errors, while, patients, with, abdominal, pathologic, conditions, generally, complained, of, abdominal, pain, results, of, an, examination, of, the, abdomen, were, considered, unremarkable, in, most, patients, and, the, symptom, was, not, pursued, there, are, four, main, types, of, autopsy, a, forensic, autopsy, is, used, to, determine, the, cause, mode, and, manner, of, death, forensic, science, involves, the, application, of, the, sciences, to, answer, questions, of, interest, to, the, legal, system, medical, examiners, attempt, to, determine, the, time, of, death, the, exact, cause, of, death, and, what, if, anything, preceded, the, death, such, as, a, struggle, a, forensic, autopsy, may, include, obtaining, biological, specimens, from, the, deceased, for, toxicological, testing, including, stomach, contents, toxicology, tests, may, reveal, the, presence, of, one, or, more, chemical, poisons, all, chemicals, in, sufficient, quantities, can, be, classified, as, a, poison, and, their, quantity, because, post, mortem, deterioration, of, the, body, together, with, the, gravitational, pooling, of, bodily, fluids, will, necessarily, alter, the, bodily, environment, toxicology, tests, may, overestimate, rather, than, underestimate, the, quantity, of, the, suspected, chemical, following, an, in, depth, examination, of, all, the, evidence, a, medical, examiner, or, coroner, will, assign, a, manner, of, death, from, the, choices, proscribed, by, the, fact, finder, s, jurisdiction, and, will, detail, the, evidence, on, the, mechanism, of, the, death, clinical, autopsies, serve, two, major, purposes, they, are, performed, to, gain, more, insight, into, pathological, processes, and, determine, what, factors, contributed, to, a, patient, s, death, for, example, material, for, infectious, disease, testing, can, be, collected, during, an, autopsy, autopsies, are, also, performed, to, ensure, the, standard, of, care, at, hospitals, autopsies, can, yield, insight, into, how, patient, deaths, can, be, prevented, in, the, future, within, the, united, kingdom, clinical, autopsies, can, be, carried, out, only, with, the, consent, of, the, family, of, the, deceased, person, as, opposed, to, a, medico, legal, autopsy, instructed, by, a, coroner, england, wales, or, procurator, fiscal, scotland, to, which, the, family, cannot, object, over, time, autopsies, have, not, only, been, able, to, determine, the, cause, of, death, but, have, also, led, to, discoveries, of, various, diseases, such, as, fetal, alcohol, syndrome, legionnaire, s, disease, and, even, viral, hepatitis, academic, autopsies, are, performed, by, students, of, anatomy, for, the, purpose, of, study, giving, medical, students, and, residents, firsthand, experience, viewing, anatomy, and, pathology, postmortem, examinations, require, the, skill, to, connect, anatomic, and, clinical, pathology, together, since, they, involve, organ, systems, and, interruptions, from, ante, mortem, and, post, mortem, these, academic, autopsies, allow, for, students, to, practice, and, develop, skills, in, pathology, and, become, meticulous, in, later, case, examinations, virtual, autopsies, are, performed, using, radiographic, techniques, which, can, be, used, in, post, mortem, examinations, for, a, deceased, individual, it, is, an, alternative, to, medical, autopsies, where, radiographs, are, used, for, example, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, and, computed, tomography, ct, scan, which, produce, radiographic, images, in, order, to, determine, the, cause, of, death, the, nature, and, the, manner, of, death, without, dissecting, the, deceased, it, can, also, be, used, in, the, identification, of, the, deceased, this, method, is, helpful, in, determining, the, questions, pertaining, to, an, autopsy, without, putting, the, examiner, at, risk, of, biohazardous, materials, that, can, be, in, an, individual, s, body, in, 2004, in, england, and, wales, there, were, 514, 000, deaths, of, which, 225, 500, were, referred, to, the, coroner, of, those, 115, 800, 22, 5, of, all, deaths, resulted, in, post, mortem, examinations, and, there, were, 28, 300, inquests, 570, with, a, jury, the, rate, of, consented, hospital, autopsy, in, the, uk, and, worldwide, has, declined, rapidly, over, the, past, 50, years, in, the, uk, in, 2013, only, 0, 7, of, inpatient, adult, deaths, were, followed, by, consented, autopsy, the, autopsy, rate, in, germany, is, below, 5, and, thus, much, lower, than, in, other, countries, in, europe, the, governmental, reimbursement, is, hardly, sufficient, to, cover, all, the, costs, so, the, medical, journal, deutsches, rzteblatt, issued, by, the, german, medical, association, makes, the, effort, to, raise, awareness, regarding, the, underfinancing, of, autopsies, the, same, sources, stated, that, autopsy, rates, in, sweden, and, finland, reach, 20, to, 30, in, the, united, states, autopsy, rates, fell, from, 17, in, 1980, to, 14, in, 1985, and, 11, 5, in, 1989, although, the, figures, vary, notably, from, county, to, county, the, body, is, received, at, a, medical, examiner, s, office, municipal, mortuary, or, hospital, in, a, body, bag, or, evidence, sheet, a, new, body, bag, is, used, for, each, body, to, ensure, that, only, evidence, from, that, body, is, contained, within, the, bag, evidence, sheets, are, an, alternative, way, to, transport, the, body, an, evidence, sheet, is, a, sterile, sheet, that, covers, the, body, when, it, is, moved, if, it, is, believed, there, may, be, any, significant, evidence, on, the, hands, for, example, gunshot, residue, or, skin, under, the, fingernails, a, separate, paper, sack, is, put, around, each, hand, and, taped, shut, around, the, wrist, there, are, two, parts, to, the, physical, examination, of, the, body, the, external, and, internal, examination, toxicology, biochemical, tests, or, genetic, testing, molecular, autopsy, often, supplement, these, and, frequently, assist, the, pathologist, in, assigning, the, cause, or, causes, of, death, at, many, institutions, the, person, responsible, for, handling, cleaning, and, moving, the, body, is, called, a, diener, the, german, word, for, servant, in, the, uk, this, role, is, performed, by, an, anatomical, pathology, technician, apt, who, will, also, assist, the, pathologist, in, eviscerating, the, body, and, reconstruction, after, the, autopsy, after, the, body, is, received, it, is, first, photographed, the, examiner, then, notes, the, kind, of, clothes, if, any, and, their, position, on, the, body, before, they, are, removed, next, any, evidence, such, as, residue, flakes, of, paint, or, other, material, is, collected, from, the, external, surfaces, of, the, body, ultraviolet, light, may, also, be, used, to, search, body, surfaces, for, any, evidence, not, easily, visible, to, the, naked, eye, samples, of, hair, nails, and, the, like, are, taken, and, the, body, may, also, be, radiographically, imaged, once, the, external, evidence, is, collected, the, body, is, removed, from, the, bag, undressed, and, any, wounds, present, are, examined, the, body, is, then, cleaned, weighed, and, measured, in, preparation, for, the, internal, examination, a, general, description, of, the, body, as, regards, ethnic, group, sex, age, hair, colour, and, length, eye, colour, and, other, distinguishing, features, birthmarks, old, scar, tissue, moles, tattoos, etc, is, then, made, a, voice, recorder, or, a, standard, examination, form, is, normally, used, to, record, this, information, in, some, countries, e, g, scotland, france, germany, russia, and, canada, an, autopsy, may, comprise, an, external, examination, only, this, concept, is, sometimes, termed, a, view, and, grant, the, principle, behind, this, is, that, the, medical, records, history, of, the, deceased, and, circumstances, of, death, have, all, indicated, as, to, the, cause, and, manner, of, death, without, the, need, for, an, internal, examination, if, not, already, in, place, a, plastic, or, rubber, brick, called, a, head, block, is, placed, under, the, shoulders, of, the, corpse, hyperflexion, of, the, neck, makes, the, spine, arch, backward, while, stretching, and, pushing, the, chest, upward, to, make, it, easier, to, incise, this, gives, the, apt, or, pathologist, maximum, exposure, to, the, trunk, after, this, is, done, the, internal, examination, begins, the, internal, examination, consists, of, inspecting, the, internal, organs, of, the, body, by, dissection, for, evidence, of, trauma, or, other, indications, of, the, cause, of, death, for, the, internal, examination, there, are, a, number, of, different, approaches, available, there, is, no, need, for, any, incision, to, be, made, which, will, be, visible, after, completion, of, the, examination, when, the, deceased, is, dressed, in, a, shroud, in, all, of, the, above, cases, the, incision, then, extends, all, the, way, down, to, the, pubic, bone, making, a, deviation, to, either, side, of, the, navel, and, avoiding, where, possible, transecting, any, scars, that, may, be, present, bleeding, from, the, cuts, is, minimal, or, non, existent, because, the, pull, of, gravity, is, producing, the, only, blood, pressure, at, this, point, related, directly, to, the, complete, lack, of, cardiac, functionality, however, in, certain, cases, there, is, anecdotal, evidence, that, bleeding, can, be, quite, profuse, especially, in, cases, of, drowning, at, this, point, shears, are, used, to, open, the, chest, cavity, the, examiner, uses, the, tool, to, cut, through, the, ribs, on, the, costal, cartilage, to, allow, the, sternum, to, be, removed, this, is, done, so, that, the, heart, and, lungs, can, be, seen, in, situ, and, that, the, heart, in, particular, the, pericardial, sac, is, not, damaged, or, disturbed, from, opening, a, pm, 40, knife, is, used, to, remove, the, sternum, from, the, soft, tissue, that, attaches, it, to, the, mediastinum, now, the, lungs, and, the, heart, are, exposed, the, sternum, is, set, aside, and, will, eventually, be, replaced, at, the, end, of, the, autopsy, at, this, stage, the, organs, are, exposed, usually, the, organs, are, removed, in, a, systematic, fashion, making, a, decision, as, to, what, order, the, organs, are, to, be, removed, will, depend, highly, on, the, case, in, question, organs, can, be, removed, in, several, ways, the, first, is, the, en, masse, technique, of, letulle, whereby, all, the, organs, are, removed, as, one, large, mass, the, second, is, the, en, bloc, method, of, ghon, the, most, popular, in, the, uk, is, a, modified, version, of, this, method, which, is, divided, into, four, groups, of, organs, although, these, are, the, two, predominant, evisceration, techniques, in, the, uk, variations, on, these, are, widespread, one, method, is, described, here, the, pericardial, sac, is, opened, to, view, the, heart, blood, for, chemical, analysis, may, be, removed, from, the, inferior, vena, cava, or, the, pulmonary, veins, before, removing, the, heart, the, pulmonary, artery, is, opened, in, order, to, search, for, a, blood, clot, the, heart, can, then, be, removed, by, cutting, the, inferior, vena, cava, the, pulmonary, veins, the, aorta, and, pulmonary, artery, and, the, superior, vena, cava, this, method, leaves, the, aortic, arch, intact, which, will, make, things, easier, for, the, embalmer, the, left, lung, is, then, easily, accessible, and, can, be, removed, by, cutting, the, bronchus, artery, and, vein, at, the, hilum, the, right, lung, can, then, be, similarly, removed, the, abdominal, organs, can, be, removed, one, by, one, after, first, examining, their, relationships, and, vessels, most, pathologists, however, prefer, the, organs, to, be, removed, all, in, one, block, using, dissection, of, the, fascia, blunt, dissection, using, the, fingers, or, hands, and, traction, the, organs, are, dissected, out, in, one, piece, for, further, inspection, and, sampling, during, autopsies, of, infants, this, method, is, used, almost, all, of, the, time, the, various, organs, are, examined, weighed, and, tissue, samples, in, the, form, of, slices, are, taken, even, major, blood, vessels, are, cut, open, and, inspected, at, this, stage, next, the, stomach, and, intestinal, contents, are, examined, and, weighed, this, could, be, useful, to, find, the, cause, and, time, of, death, due, to, the, natural, passage, of, food, through, the, bowel, during, digestion, the, more, area, empty, the, longer, the, deceased, had, gone, without, a, meal, before, death, the, body, block, that, was, used, earlier, to, elevate, the, chest, cavity, is, now, used, to, elevate, the, head, to, examine, the, brain, an, incision, is, made, from, behind, one, ear, over, the, crown, of, the, head, to, a, point, behind, the, other, ear, when, the, autopsy, is, completed, the, incision, can, be, neatly, sewn, up, and, is, not, noticed, when, the, head, is, resting, on, a, pillow, in, an, open, casket, funeral, the, scalp, is, pulled, away, from, the, skull, in, two, flaps, with, the, front, flap, going, over, the, face, and, the, rear, flap, over, the, back, of, the, neck, the, skull, is, then, cut, with, a, circular, or, semicircular, bladed, reciprocating, saw, to, create, a, cap, that, can, be, pulled, off, exposing, the, brain, the, brain, is, then, observed, in, situ, then, the, brain, s, connections, to, the, cranial, nerves, and, spinal, cord, are, severed, and, the, brain, is, lifted, out, of, the, skull, for, further, examination, if, the, brain, needs, to, be, preserved, before, being, inspected, it, is, contained, in, a, large, container, of, formalin, 15, percent, solution, of, formaldehyde, gas, in, buffered, water, for, at, least, two, but, preferably, four, weeks, this, not, only, preserves, the, brain, but, also, makes, it, firmer, allowing, easier, handling, without, corrupting, the, tissue, an, important, component, of, the, autopsy, is, the, reconstitution, of, the, body, such, that, it, can, be, viewed, if, desired, by, relatives, of, the, deceased, following, the, procedure, after, the, examination, the, body, has, an, open, and, empty, thoracic, cavity, with, chest, flaps, open, on, both, sides, the, top, of, the, skull, is, missing, and, the, skull, flaps, are, pulled, over, the, face, and, neck, it, is, unusual, to, examine, the, face, arms, hands, or, legs, internally, in, the, uk, following, the, human, tissue, act, 2004, all, organs, and, tissue, must, be, returned, to, the, body, unless, permission, is, given, by, the, family, to, retain, any, tissue, for, further, investigation, normally, the, internal, body, cavity, is, lined, with, cotton, wool, or, a, similar, material, and, the, organs, are, then, placed, into, a, plastic, bag, to, prevent, leakage, and, are, returned, to, the, body, cavity, the, chest, flaps, are, then, closed, and, sewn, back, together, and, the, skull, cap, is, sewed, back, in, place, then, the, body, may, be, wrapped, in, a, shroud, and, it, is, common, for, relatives, to, not, be, able, to, tell, the, procedure, has, been, done, when, the, body, is, viewed, in, a, funeral, parlor, after, embalming, an, autopsy, of, stroke, may, be, able, to, establish, the, time, taken, from, the, onset, of, cerebral, infarction, to, the, time, of, death, various, microscopic, findings, are, present, at, times, from, infarction, as, follows, around, 3000, bce, ancient, egyptians, were, one, of, the, first, civilizations, to, practice, the, removal, and, examination, of, the, internal, organs, of, humans, in, the, religious, practice, of, mummification, autopsies, that, opened, the, body, to, determine, the, cause, of, death, were, attested, at, least, in, the, early, third, millennium, bce, although, they, were, opposed, in, many, ancient, societies, where, it, was, believed, that, the, outward, disfigurement, of, dead, persons, prevented, them, from, entering, the, afterlife, as, with, the, egyptians, who, removed, the, organs, through, tiny, slits, in, the, body, notable, greek, autopsists, were, erasistratus, and, herophilus, of, chalcedon, who, lived, in, 3rd, century, bce, alexandria, but, in, general, autopsies, were, rare, in, ancient, greece, in, 44, bce, julius, caesar, was, the, subject, of, an, official, autopsy, after, his, murder, by, rival, senators, the, physician, s, report, noting, that, the, second, stab, wound, caesar, received, was, the, fatal, one, julius, caesar, had, been, stabbed, a, total, of, 23, times, by, around, 150, bce, ancient, roman, legal, practice, had, established, clear, parameters, for, autopsies, the, greatest, ancient, anatomist, was, galen, ce, 129, c, 216, whose, findings, would, not, be, challenged, until, the, renaissance, over, a, thousand, years, later, ibn, tufail, has, elaborated, on, autopsy, in, his, treatise, called, hayy, ibn, yaqzan, and, nadia, maftouni, discussing, the, subject, in, an, extensive, article, believes, him, to, be, among, the, early, supporters, of, autopsy, and, vivisection, the, dissection, of, human, remains, for, medical, or, scientific, reasons, continued, to, be, practiced, irregularly, after, the, romans, for, instance, by, the, arab, physicians, avenzoar, and, ibn, al, nafis, in, europe, they, were, done, with, enough, regularity, to, become, skilled, as, early, as, 1200, and, successful, efforts, to, preserve, the, body, by, filling, the, veins, with, wax, and, metals, until, the, 20th, century, it, was, thought, that, the, modern, autopsy, process, derived, from, the, anatomists, of, the, renaissance, giovanni, battista, morgagni, 1682, 1771, celebrated, as, the, father, of, anatomical, pathology, wrote, the, first, exhaustive, work, on, pathology, de, sedibus, et, causis, morborum, per, anatomen, indagatis, the, seats, and, causes, of, diseases, investigated, by, anatomy, 1769, in, 1543, andreas, vesalius, conducted, a, public, dissection, of, the, body, of, a, former, criminal, he, asserted, and, articulated, the, bones, this, became, the, world, s, oldest, surviving, anatomical, preparation, it, is, still, displayed, at, the, anatomical, museum, at, the, university, of, basel, in, the, mid, 1800s, carl, von, rokitansky, and, colleagues, at, the, second, vienna, medical, school, began, to, undertake, dissections, as, a, means, to, improve, diagnostic, medicine, the, 19th, century, medical, researcher, rudolf, virchow, in, response, to, a, lack, of, standardization, of, autopsy, procedures, established, and, published, specific, autopsy, protocols, one, such, protocol, still, bears, his, name, he, also, developed, the, concept, of, pathological, processes, during, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, the, scotland, yard, created, the, office, of, the, forensic, pathologist, a, medical, examiner, trained, in, medicine, charged, with, investigating, the, cause, of, all, unnatural, deaths, including, accidents, homicides, suicides, etc, a, post, mortem, examination, or, necropsy, is, far, more, common, in, veterinary, medicine, than, in, human, medicine, for, many, species, that, exhibit, few, external, symptoms, sheep, or, that, are, not, suited, to, detailed, clinical, examination, poultry, cage, birds, zoo, animals, it, is, a, common, method, used, by, veterinary, physicians, to, come, to, a, diagnosis, a, necropsy, is, mostly, used, like, an, autopsy, to, determine, the, cause, of, death, the, entire, body, is, examined, at, the, gross, visual, level, and, samples, are, collected, for, additional, analyses
