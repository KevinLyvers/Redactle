the, cryptomonads, or, cryptophytes, are, a, group, of, algae, most, of, which, have, plastids, they, are, traditionally, considered, a, division, of, algae, among, phycologists, under, the, name, of, cryptophyta, they, are, common, in, freshwater, and, also, occur, in, marine, and, brackish, habitats, each, cell, is, around, 10, 50, m, in, size, and, flattened, in, shape, with, an, anterior, groove, or, pocket, at, the, edge, of, the, pocket, there, are, typically, two, slightly, unequal, flagella, some, may, exhibit, mixotrophy, they, are, classified, as, clade, cryptomonada, which, is, divided, into, two, classes, heterotrophic, goniomonadea, and, phototrophic, cryptophyceae, the, two, groups, are, united, under, three, shared, morphological, characteristics, presence, of, a, periplast, ejectisomes, with, secondary, scroll, and, mitochondrial, cristae, with, flat, tubules, genetic, studies, as, early, as, 1994, also, supported, the, hypothesis, that, goniomonas, was, sister, to, cryptophyceae, a, study, in, 2018, found, strong, evidence, that, the, common, ancestor, of, cryptomonada, was, an, autotrophic, protist, cryptomonads, are, distinguished, by, the, presence, of, characteristic, extrusomes, called, ejectosomes, which, consist, of, two, connected, spiral, ribbons, held, under, tension, if, the, cells, are, irritated, either, by, mechanical, chemical, or, light, stress, they, discharge, propelling, the, cell, in, a, zig, zag, course, away, from, the, disturbance, large, ejectosomes, visible, under, the, light, microscope, are, associated, with, the, pocket, smaller, ones, occur, underneath, the, periplast, the, cryptophyte, specific, cell, surrounding, except, for, the, class, goniomonadea, which, lacks, plastids, entirely, and, cryptomonas, paramecium, previously, called, chilomonas, paramecium, which, has, leucoplasts, cryptomonads, have, one, or, two, chloroplasts, these, contain, chlorophylls, a, and, c, together, with, phycobiliproteins, and, other, pigments, and, vary, in, color, brown, red, to, blueish, green, each, is, surrounded, by, four, membranes, and, there, is, a, reduced, cell, nucleus, called, a, nucleomorph, between, the, middle, two, this, indicates, that, the, plastid, was, derived, from, a, eukaryotic, symbiont, shown, by, genetic, studies, to, have, been, a, red, alga, however, the, plastids, are, very, different, from, red, algal, plastids, phycobiliproteins, are, present, but, only, in, the, thylakoid, lumen, and, are, present, only, as, phycoerythrin, or, phycocyanin, in, the, case, of, rhodomonas, the, crystal, structure, has, been, determined, to, 1, 63, and, it, has, been, shown, that, the, alpha, subunit, bears, no, relation, to, any, other, known, phycobiliprotein, a, few, cryptomonads, such, as, cryptomonas, can, form, palmelloid, stages, but, readily, escape, the, surrounding, mucus, to, become, free, living, flagellates, again, some, cryptomonas, species, may, also, form, immotile, microbial, cysts, resting, stages, with, rigid, cell, walls, to, survive, unfavorable, conditions, cryptomonad, flagella, are, inserted, parallel, to, one, another, and, are, covered, by, bipartite, hairs, called, mastigonemes, formed, within, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, and, transported, to, the, cell, surface, small, scales, may, also, be, present, on, the, flagella, and, cell, body, the, mitochondria, have, flat, cristae, and, mitosis, is, open, sexual, reproduction, has, also, been, reported, the, first, mention, of, cryptomonads, appears, to, have, been, made, by, christian, gottfried, ehrenberg, in, 1831, while, studying, infusoria, later, botanists, treated, them, as, a, separate, algae, group, class, cryptophyceae, or, division, cryptophyta, while, zoologists, treated, them, as, the, flagellate, protozoa, order, cryptomonadina, in, some, classifications, the, cryptomonads, were, considered, close, relatives, of, the, dinoflagellates, because, of, their, seemingly, similar, pigmentation, being, grouped, as, the, pyrrhophyta, cryptomonad, chloroplasts, are, closely, related, to, those, of, the, heterokonts, and, haptophytes, and, the, three, groups, were, united, by, cavalier, smith, as, the, chromista, however, the, case, that, the, organisms, themselves, are, closely, related, was, counter, indicated, by, the, major, differences, in, cell, organization, ultrastructural, identity, suggesting, that, the, three, major, lineages, assigned, to, the, chromists, had, acquired, plastids, independently, and, that, chromists, are, polyphyletic, the, perspective, that, cryptomonads, are, primitively, heterotrophic, and, secondarily, acquired, chloroplasts, is, supported, by, molecular, evidence, parfrey, et, al, and, burki, et, al, placed, cryptophyceae, as, a, sister, clade, to, the, green, algae, or, green, algae, plus, glaucophytes, the, sister, group, to, the, cryptomonads, is, likely, the, kathablepharids, also, referred, to, as, katablepharids, a, group, of, flagellates, that, also, have, ejectisomes, one, suggested, grouping, is, as, follows, 1, cryptomonas, 2, chroomonas, komma, and, hemiselmis, 3, rhodomonas, rhinomonas, storeatula, 4, guillardia, hanusia, 5, geminigera, plagioselmis, teleaulax, 6, proteomonas, sulcata, 7, falcomonas, daucoides
