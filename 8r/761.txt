american, wolverine, g, g, luscus, eurasian, wolverine, g, g, gulo, mustela, gulo, linnaeus, 1758, ursus, luscus, linnaeus, 1758, the, wolverine, w, l, v, r, i, n, wuul, v, reen, us, also, w, l, v, r, i, n, wuul, v, reen, gulo, gulo, also, called, the, carcajou, or, quickhatch, from, east, cree, kwiihkwahaacheew, is, the, largest, land, dwelling, member, of, the, family, mustelidae, it, is, a, muscular, carnivore, and, a, solitary, animal, the, wolverine, has, a, reputation, for, ferocity, and, strength, out, of, proportion, to, its, size, with, the, documented, ability, to, kill, prey, many, times, larger, than, itself, the, wolverine, is, found, primarily, in, remote, reaches, of, the, northern, boreal, forests, and, subarctic, and, alpine, tundra, of, the, northern, hemisphere, with, the, greatest, numbers, in, northern, canada, the, u, s, state, of, alaska, the, mainland, nordic, countries, of, europe, and, throughout, western, russia, and, siberia, its, population, has, steadily, declined, since, the, 19th, century, owing, to, trapping, range, reduction, and, habitat, fragmentation, the, wolverine, is, now, essentially, absent, from, the, southern, end, of, its, range, in, both, europe, and, north, america, the, wolverine, s, questionable, reputation, as, an, insatiable, glutton, reflected, in, its, latin, genus, name, gulo, meaning, glutton, may, be, in, part, due, to, a, false, etymology, the, less, common, name, for, the, animal, in, norwegian, fjellfross, meaning, mountain, cat, is, thought, to, have, worked, its, way, into, german, as, vielfra, which, means, glutton, literally, devours, much, its, name, in, other, west, germanic, languages, is, similar, e, g, dutch, veelvraat, the, finnish, name, is, ahma, derived, from, ahmatti, which, is, translated, as, glutton, similarly, the, estonian, name, is, ahm, with, the, equivalent, meaning, to, the, finnish, name, in, lithuanian, it, is, ernis, in, latvian, tinis, or, mrija, the, eastern, slavic, rosomakha, and, the, polish, and, czech, name, rosom, k, seem, to, be, borrowed, from, the, finnish, rasva, maha, fat, belly, similarly, the, hungarian, name, is, rozsom, k, or, torkosborz, which, means, gluttonous, badger, in, french, speaking, parts, of, canada, the, wolverine, is, referred, to, as, carcajou, borrowed, from, the, innu, aimun, or, montagnais, ku, ku, tsheu, however, in, france, the, wolverine, s, name, is, glouton, glutton, purported, gluttony, is, reflected, neither, in, the, english, name, wolverine, nor, in, the, names, used, in, north, germanic, languages, the, english, word, wolverine, alteration, of, the, earlier, form, wolvering, of, uncertain, origin, probably, implies, a, little, wolf, the, name, in, proto, norse, erafaz, and, old, norse, jarfr, lives, on, in, the, regular, icelandic, name, jarfi, regular, norwegian, name, jerv, regular, swedish, name, j, rv, and, regular, danish, name, j, rv, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, the, wolverine, is, most, closely, related, to, the, tayra, and, martens, all, of, which, shared, a, eurasian, ancestor, there, are, two, subspecies, the, old, world, form, gulo, gulo, gulo, and, the, new, world, form, g, g, luscus, some, authors, had, described, as, many, as, four, additional, north, american, subspecies, including, ones, limited, to, vancouver, island, g, g, vancouverensis, and, the, kenai, peninsula, in, alaska, g, g, katschemakensis, however, the, most, currently, accepted, taxonomy, recognizes, either, the, two, continental, subspecies, or, g, gulo, as, a, single, holarctic, taxon, recently, compiled, genetic, evidence, suggests, most, of, north, america, s, wolverines, are, descended, from, a, single, source, likely, originating, from, beringia, during, the, last, glaciation, and, rapidly, expanding, thereafter, though, considerable, uncertainty, to, this, conclusion, is, due, to, the, difficulty, of, collecting, samples, in, the, extremely, depleted, southern, extent, of, the, range, anatomically, the, wolverine, is, an, elongated, animal, that, is, low, to, the, ground, with, strong, limbs, broad, and, rounded, head, small, eyes, and, short, rounded, ears, it, most, closely, resembles, a, large, fisher, though, its, legs, are, short, its, large, five, toed, paws, with, crampon, like, claws, and, plantigrade, posture, enable, it, to, climb, up, and, over, steep, cliffs, trees, and, snow, covered, peaks, with, relative, ease, the, adult, wolverine, is, about, the, size, of, a, medium, dog, with, a, body, length, ranging, from, 65, 109, cm, 26, 43, in, standing, 36, 45, cm, 14, 18, in, at, the, shoulder, and, a, tail, length, of, 17, 26, cm, 6, 1, 2, 10, in, weight, is, usually, 11, 18, kg, 24, 40, lb, in, males, and, in, females, 8, 12, kg, 18, 26, lb, exceptionally, large, males, of, as, much, as, 32, kg, 71, lb, are, referenced, in, soviet, literature, though, such, weights, are, deemed, in, mammals, of, the, soviet, union, to, be, improbable, the, males, are, often, 10, 15, larger, than, the, females, in, linear, measurements, and, can, be, 30, 40, greater, in, weight, according, to, some, sources, eurasian, wolverines, are, claimed, to, be, larger, and, heavier, than, those, in, north, america, with, weights, reaching, up, to, 20, kg, 44, lb, however, this, may, refer, more, specifically, to, areas, such, as, siberia, as, data, from, fennoscandian, wolverines, shows, they, are, typically, around, the, same, size, as, their, american, counterparts, it, is, the, largest, of, terrestrial, mustelids, only, the, marine, dwelling, sea, otter, the, giant, otter, of, the, amazon, basin, and, the, semi, aquatic, african, clawless, otter, are, larger, while, the, european, badger, may, reach, a, similar, body, mass, especially, in, autumn, wolverines, have, thick, dark, oily, fur, which, is, highly, hydrophobic, making, it, resistant, to, frost, this, has, led, to, its, traditional, popularity, among, hunters, and, trappers, as, a, lining, in, jackets, and, parkas, in, arctic, conditions, a, light, silvery, facial, mask, is, distinct, in, some, individuals, and, a, pale, buff, stripe, runs, laterally, from, the, shoulders, along, the, side, and, crossing, the, rump, just, above, a, 25, 35, cm, 10, 14, in, bushy, tail, some, individuals, display, prominent, white, hair, patches, on, their, throats, or, chests, like, many, other, mustelids, it, has, potent, anal, scent, glands, used, for, marking, territory, and, sexual, signaling, the, pungent, odor, has, given, rise, to, the, nicknames, skunk, bear, and, nasty, cat, the, anal, gland, secretion, for, the, samples, obtained, from, six, animal, s, secretion, was, complex, and, variable, 123, compounds, were, detected, in, total, with, the, number, per, animal, ranging, from, 45, to, 71, compounds, only, six, compounds, were, common, to, all, extracts, 3, methylbutanoic, acid, 2, methylbutanoic, acid, phenylacetic, acid, alpha, tocopherol, cholesterol, and, a, compound, tentatively, identified, as, 2, methyldecanoic, acid, the, highly, odoriferous, thietanes, and, dithiolanes, found, in, anal, gland, secretions, of, some, members, of, the, mustelinae, were, not, observed, the, composition, of, the, wolverine, s, anal, gland, secretion, is, similar, to, that, of, two, other, members, of, the, mustelinae, the, pine, and, beech, marten, martes, spp, wolverines, like, other, mustelids, possess, a, special, upper, molar, in, the, back, of, the, mouth, that, is, rotated, 90, degrees, towards, the, inside, of, the, mouth, this, special, characteristic, allows, wolverines, to, tear, off, meat, from, prey, or, carrion, that, has, been, frozen, solid, wolverines, live, primarily, in, isolated, arctic, boreal, and, alpine, regions, of, northern, canada, alaska, siberia, and, fennoscandia, they, are, also, native, to, european, russia, the, baltic, countries, the, russian, far, east, northeast, china, and, mongolia, wolverine, remains, have, been, found, in, ukraine, but, they, are, extinct, there, today, and, it, is, unclear, whether, the, wolverines, would, have, formed, sustainable, populations, unique, records, of, encounters, with, wolverines, have, been, noted, in, latvia, the, most, recent, one, being, in, late, july, 2022, although, it, can, be, disputed, because, of, the, unclear, footage, the, population, was, widespread, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, but, nowadays, it, is, not, native, to, the, area, most, new, world, wolverines, live, in, canada, and, alaska, however, wolverines, were, once, recorded, as, also, being, present, in, colorado, areas, of, the, southwestern, united, states, arizona, and, new, mexico, the, midwest, indiana, nebraska, north, and, south, dakota, ohio, minnesota, and, wisconsin, new, england, maine, new, hampshire, vermont, and, massachusetts, and, in, new, york, and, pennsylvania, in, the, sierra, nevada, wolverines, were, sighted, near, winnemucca, lake, in, spring, 1995, and, at, toe, jam, lake, north, of, the, yosemite, border, in, 1996, and, later, photographed, by, baited, cameras, including, in, 2008, and, 2009, near, lake, tahoe, according, to, a, 2014, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, publication, wolverines, are, found, in, the, north, cascades, in, washington, and, the, northern, rocky, mountains, in, idaho, montana, oregon, wallowa, range, and, wyoming, individual, wolverines, have, also, moved, into, historic, range, in, the, sierra, nevada, mountains, of, california, and, the, southern, rocky, mountains, of, colorado, but, have, not, established, breeding, populations, in, these, areas, in, 2022, colorado, parks, and, wildlife, considered, plans, to, reintroduce, the, wolverine, to, the, state, wolverines, are, also, found, in, utah, but, are, very, rarely, seen, with, only, six, confirmed, sightings, since, the, first, confirmed, sighting, in, 1979, three, of, these, six, confirmed, utah, sightings, have, been, caught, on, video, a, wolverine, a, male, was, finally, captured, and, tagged, in, utah, in, 2022, before, being, released, back, into, the, wild, to, better, understand, the, animal, s, range, in, august, 2020, the, national, park, service, reported, that, wolverines, had, been, sighted, at, mount, rainier, washington, for, the, first, time, in, more, than, a, century, the, sighting, was, of, a, reproductive, female, and, her, two, offspring, in, 2004, the, first, confirmed, sighting, of, a, wolverine, in, michigan, since, the, early, 19th, century, took, place, when, a, michigan, department, of, natural, resources, wildlife, biologist, photographed, a, wolverine, in, ubly, michigan, the, specimen, was, found, dead, at, the, minden, city, state, game, area, in, sanilac, county, michigan, in, 2010, wolverines, are, primarily, scavengers, most, of, their, food, is, carrion, especially, in, winter, and, early, spring, they, may, find, carrion, themselves, feed, on, it, after, the, predator, often, a, wolf, pack, has, finished, or, simply, take, it, from, another, predator, wolverines, are, known, to, follow, wolf, and, lynx, trails, to, scavenge, the, remains, of, their, kills, whether, eating, live, prey, or, carrion, the, wolverine, s, feeding, style, appears, voracious, leading, to, the, nickname, of, glutton, also, the, basis, of, the, scientific, name, however, this, feeding, style, is, believed, to, be, an, adaptation, to, food, scarcity, especially, in, winter, the, wolverine, is, also, a, powerful, and, versatile, predator, its, prey, mainly, consists, of, small, to, medium, sized, mammals, but, wolverines, have, been, recorded, killing, prey, many, times, larger, than, itself, such, as, adult, deer, prey, species, include, porcupines, squirrels, chipmunks, beavers, marmots, moles, gophers, rabbits, voles, mice, rats, shrews, lemmings, caribou, roe, deer, white, tailed, deer, mule, deer, sheep, goats, cattle, bison, moose, and, elk, smaller, predators, are, occasionally, preyed, on, including, martens, mink, foxes, eurasian, lynx, weasels, coyote, and, wolf, pups, wolverines, have, also, been, known, to, kill, canada, lynx, in, the, yukon, of, canada, wolverines, often, pursue, live, prey, that, are, relatively, easy, to, obtain, including, animals, caught, in, traps, newborn, mammals, and, deer, including, adult, moose, and, elk, when, they, are, weakened, by, winter, or, immobilized, by, heavy, snow, their, diets, are, sometimes, supplemented, by, birds, eggs, birds, especially, geese, roots, seeds, insect, larvae, and, berries, adult, wolverines, appear, to, be, one, of, the, few, conspecific, mammal, carnivores, to, actively, pose, a, threat, to, golden, eagles, wolverines, were, observed, to, prey, on, nestling, golden, eagles, in, denali, national, park, during, incubation, in, northern, sweden, an, incubating, adult, golden, eagle, was, killed, on, its, nest, by, a, wolverine, wolverines, inhabiting, the, old, world, specifically, fennoscandia, hunt, more, actively, than, their, north, american, relatives, this, may, be, because, competing, predator, populations, in, eurasia, are, less, dense, making, it, more, practical, for, the, wolverine, to, hunt, for, itself, than, to, wait, for, another, animal, to, make, a, kill, and, then, try, to, snatch, it, they, often, feed, on, carrion, left, by, wolves, so, changes, in, wolf, populations, may, affect, the, population, of, wolverines, they, are, also, known, on, occasion, to, eat, plant, material, wolverines, often, cache, their, food, during, times, of, plenty, this, is, of, particular, importance, to, lactating, females, in, the, winter, and, early, spring, a, time, when, food, is, scarce, wolverines, are, induced, ovulators, successful, males, will, form, lifetime, relationships, with, two, or, three, females, which, they, will, visit, occasionally, while, other, males, are, left, without, a, mate, mating, season, is, in, the, summer, but, the, actual, implantation, of, the, embryo, blastocyst, in, the, uterus, is, stayed, until, early, winter, delaying, the, development, of, the, fetus, females, will, often, not, produce, young, if, food, is, scarce, the, gestation, period, is, 30, 50, days, and, litters, of, typically, two, or, three, young, kits, are, born, in, the, spring, kits, develop, rapidly, reaching, adult, size, within, the, first, year, the, typical, longevity, of, a, wolverine, in, captivity, is, around, 15, to, 17, years, but, in, the, wild, the, average, lifespan, is, more, likely, between, 8, and, 10, years, 676, fathers, make, visits, to, their, offspring, until, they, are, weaned, at, 10, weeks, of, age, also, once, the, young, are, about, six, months, old, some, reconnect, with, their, fathers, and, travel, together, for, a, time, wolves, american, black, bears, brown, bears, cougars, and, golden, eagles, are, capable, of, killing, wolverines, particularly, young, and, inexperienced, individuals, wolves, are, thought, to, be, the, wolverine, s, most, important, natural, predator, with, the, arrival, of, wolves, to, a, wolverine, s, territory, presumably, leading, the, latter, to, abandon, the, area, armed, with, powerful, jaws, sharp, claws, and, a, thick, hide, wolverines, like, most, mustelids, are, remarkably, strong, for, their, size, they, may, defend, against, larger, or, more, numerous, predators, such, as, wolves, or, bears, by, far, their, most, serious, predator, is, the, grey, wolf, with, an, extensive, record, of, wolverine, fatalities, attributed, to, wolves, in, both, north, america, and, eurasia, in, north, america, another, predator, less, frequent, is, the, cougar, at, least, one, account, reported, a, wolverine, s, apparent, attempt, to, steal, a, kill, from, a, black, bear, although, the, bear, won, what, was, ultimately, a, fatal, contest, for, the, wolverine, there, are, a, few, accounts, of, brown, bears, killing, and, consuming, wolverines, as, well, and, although, also, reported, at, times, to, be, chased, off, prey, in, some, areas, such, as, denali, national, park, wolverines, seemed, to, try, to, actively, avoid, encounters, with, grizzly, bears, as, they, have, been, reported, in, areas, where, wolves, start, hunting, them, wolverines, have, been, observed, to, use, urine, as, a, scent, marking, behavior, headspace, analysis, of, the, volatiles, emanating, from, urine, samples, identified, 19, potential, semiochemicals, the, major, classes, of, identified, chemicals, are, the, ketones, 2, heptanone, 4, heptanone, and, 4, nonanone, and, the, monoterpenes, alpha, pinene, beta, pinene, limonene, linalool, and, geraniol, in, other, mammals, the, excretion, of, these, terpenes, is, unusual, the, conifer, needles, that, are, found, in, wolverine, scat, are, likely, the, source, of, these, monoterpenes, the, world, s, total, wolverine, population, is, not, known, the, animal, exhibits, a, low, population, density, and, requires, a, very, large, home, range, the, wolverine, is, listed, by, the, iucn, as, least, concern, because, of, its, wide, distribution, remaining, large, populations, and, the, unlikelihood, that, it, is, in, decline, at, a, rate, fast, enough, to, trigger, even, near, threatened, the, range, of, a, male, wolverine, can, be, more, than, 620, km, 2, 240, sq, mi, encompassing, the, ranges, of, several, females, which, have, smaller, home, ranges, of, roughly, 130, 260, km, 2, 50, 100, mi, 2, adult, wolverines, try, for, the, most, part, to, keep, nonoverlapping, ranges, with, adults, of, the, same, sex, radio, tracking, suggests, an, animal, can, range, hundreds, of, miles, in, a, few, months, female, wolverines, burrow, into, snow, in, february, to, create, a, den, which, is, used, until, weaning, in, mid, may, areas, inhabited, nonseasonally, by, wolverines, are, thus, restricted, to, zones, with, late, spring, snowmelts, this, fact, has, led, to, concern, that, global, warming, will, shrink, the, ranges, of, wolverine, populations, this, requirement, for, large, territories, brings, wolverines, into, conflict, with, human, development, and, hunting, and, trapping, further, reduce, their, numbers, causing, them, to, disappear, from, large, parts, of, their, former, range, attempts, to, have, them, declared, an, endangered, species, have, met, with, little, success, in, february, 2013, the, united, states, fish, and, wildlife, service, proposed, giving, endangered, species, act, protections, to, the, wolverine, due, to, its, winter, habitat, in, the, northern, rockies, diminishing, this, was, as, a, result, of, a, lawsuit, brought, by, the, center, for, biological, diversity, and, defenders, of, wildlife, in, november, 2023, the, united, states, fish, and, wildlife, service, announced, that, it, was, adding, the, wolverine, in, the, united, states, lower, 48, states, to, the, threatened, list, the, wildlife, conservation, society, reported, in, june, 2009, that, a, wolverine, researchers, had, been, tracking, for, almost, three, months, had, crossed, into, northern, colorado, society, officials, had, tagged, the, young, male, wolverine, in, wyoming, near, grand, teton, national, park, and, it, had, traveled, southward, for, about, 500, miles, 800, km, it, was, the, first, wolverine, seen, in, colorado, since, 1919, and, its, appearance, was, also, confirmed, by, the, colorado, division, of, wildlife, in, may, 2016, the, same, wolverine, was, killed, by, a, cattle, ranch, hand, in, north, dakota, ending, a, greater, than, 800, mile, 1, 300, km, trip, by, this, lone, male, wolverine, dubbed, m, 56, this, was, the, first, verified, sighting, of, a, wolverine, in, north, dakota, in, 150, years, in, february, 2014, a, wolverine, was, seen, in, utah, the, first, confirmed, sighting, in, that, state, in, 30, years, around, a, hundred, wolverines, are, held, in, zoos, across, north, america, and, europe, and, they, have, been, bred, in, captivity, but, only, with, difficulty, and, high, infant, mortality, many, north, american, cities, sports, teams, and, organizations, use, the, wolverine, as, a, mascot, for, example, the, us, state, of, michigan, is, by, tradition, known, as, the, wolverine, state, and, the, university, of, michigan, takes, the, animal, as, its, mascot, there, have, also, been, professional, baseball, and, football, clubs, called, the, wolverines, the, association, is, well, and, long, established, for, example, many, detroiters, volunteered, to, fight, during, the, american, civil, war, and, george, armstrong, custer, who, led, the, michigan, brigade, called, them, the, wolverines, the, origins, of, this, association, are, obscure, it, may, derive, from, a, busy, trade, in, wolverine, furs, in, sault, ste, marie, in, the, 18th, century, or, may, recall, a, disparagement, intended, to, compare, early, settlers, in, michigan, with, the, vicious, mammal, wolverines, are, however, extremely, rare, in, michigan, a, sighting, in, february, 2004, near, ubly, was, the, first, confirmed, sighting, in, michigan, in, 200, years, the, animal, was, found, dead, in, 2010, the, marvel, comics, superhero, james, logan, howlett, was, given, the, name, wolverine, because, of, his, short, stature, keen, animal, senses, ferocity, and, most, notably, claws, that, retract, from, both, sets, of, knuckles, the, wolverine, is, prevalent, in, stories, and, oral, history, from, various, algonquian, tribes, and, figures, prominently, in, the, mythology, of, the, innu, people, of, eastern, quebec, and, labrador, the, wolverine, is, known, as, kuekuatsheu, a, conniving, trickster, who, created, the, world, the, story, of, the, formation, of, the, innu, world, begins, long, ago, when, kuekuatsheu, built, a, big, boat, similar, to, noah, s, ark, and, put, all, the, various, animal, species, in, it, there, was, a, great, deal, of, rain, and, the, land, was, flooded, kuekuatsheu, told, a, mink, to, dive, into, the, water, to, retrieve, some, mud, and, rocks, which, he, mixed, together, to, create, an, island, which, is, the, world, that, is, presently, inhabited, along, with, all, the, animals, many, tales, of, kuekuatsheu, are, often, humorous, and, irreverent, and, include, crude, references, to, bodily, functions, some, northeastern, tribes, such, as, the, mi, kmaq, and, passamaquoddy, refer, to, the, wolverine, as, lox, who, usually, appears, in, tales, as, a, trickster, and, thief, although, generally, more, dangerous, than, its, innu, counterpart, and, is, often, depicted, as, a, companion, to, the, wolf, similarly, the, den, a, group, of, the, athabaskan, speaking, natives, of, northwestern, canada, have, many, stories, of, the, wolverine, as, a, trickster, and, cultural, transformer, much, like, the, coyote, in, the, navajo, tradition, or, raven, in, northwest, coast, traditions
