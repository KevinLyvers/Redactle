35, see, text, atomarchus, chilopoma, eutaenia, eutainia, phamnovis, prymnomiodon, stypocemus, tropidonote, tropidonotus, garter, snake, is, the, common, name, for, small, to, medium, sized, snakes, belonging, to, the, genus, thamnophis, in, the, family, colubridae, they, are, native, to, north, and, central, america, ranging, from, central, canada, in, the, north, to, costa, rica, in, the, south, with, about, 35, recognized, species, and, subspecies, garter, snakes, are, highly, variable, in, appearance, generally, they, have, large, round, eyes, with, rounded, pupils, a, slender, build, keeled, scales, appearing, raised, and, a, pattern, of, longitudinal, stripes, that, may, or, may, not, include, spots, although, some, have, no, stripes, at, all, certain, subspecies, have, stripes, of, blue, yellow, or, red, mixed, with, black, tops, and, beige, tan, underbelly, markings, they, also, vary, significantly, in, total, length, from, 18, to, 51, in, 46, to, 130, cm, with, no, real, consensus, on, the, classification, of, the, species, of, thamnophis, disagreements, between, taxonomists, and, disputed, sources, such, as, field, guides, are, common, one, area, of, debate, for, example, is, whether, or, not, two, specific, types, of, snake, are, separate, species, or, subspecies, of, the, same, garter, snakes, are, closely, related, to, the, genus, nerodia, water, snakes, with, some, species, having, been, moved, back, and, forth, between, genera, the, first, garter, snake, to, be, scientifically, described, was, the, eastern, garter, snake, now, thamnophis, sirtalis, sirtalis, by, zoologist, and, taxonomist, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, the, genus, thamnophis, was, described, by, leopold, fitzinger, in, 1843, as, the, genus, for, the, garter, snakes, and, ribbon, snakes, many, snakes, previously, identified, as, their, own, genera, or, species, have, been, reclassified, as, species, or, subspecies, in, thamnophis, the, reptile, database, currently, recognised, 37, species, in, the, genus, some, with, several, subspecies, native, to, north, and, central, america, species, in, the, genus, thamnophis, can, be, found, in, all, of, the, lower, 48, united, states, and, all, of, the, canadian, provinces, they, are, found, from, the, subarctic, plains, of, west, central, canada, east, through, ontario, and, quebec, from, atlantic, canada, and, south, to, florida, across, the, southern, and, central, u, s, into, the, arid, regions, of, the, southwest, and, mexico, guatemala, and, south, to, the, neotropics, and, costa, rica, garter, snakes, are, not, originally, native, to, the, eastern, canadian, island, of, newfoundland, but, have, been, breeding, there, in, the, wild, and, gradually, spreading, since, at, least, 2010, it, is, unknown, how, they, reached, the, island, probably, accidentally, via, hay, shipments, or, as, escaped, pets, their, wide, distribution, is, due, to, their, varied, diets, and, adaptability, to, different, habitats, with, varying, proximity, to, water, however, in, the, western, part, of, north, america, these, snakes, are, more, aquatic, than, in, the, eastern, portion, garter, snakes, live, in, a, variety, of, habitats, including, forests, woodlands, fields, grasslands, and, lawns, but, never, far, from, water, often, an, adjacent, wetland, stream, or, pond, this, reflects, the, fact, that, amphibians, are, a, large, part, of, their, diet, garter, snakes, are, often, found, near, small, ponds, with, tall, weeds, garter, snakes, have, complex, pheromonal, communication, systems, they, can, find, other, snakes, by, following, their, pheromone, scented, trails, male, and, female, skin, pheromones, are, so, different, as, to, be, immediately, distinguishable, however, male, garter, snakes, sometimes, produce, both, male, and, female, pheromones, during, the, mating, season, this, ability, fools, other, males, into, attempting, to, mate, with, them, this, causes, the, transfer, of, heat, to, them, in, kleptothermy, which, is, an, advantage, immediately, after, hibernation, allowing, them, to, become, more, active, male, snakes, giving, off, both, male, and, female, pheromones, have, been, shown, to, garner, more, copulations, than, normal, males, in, the, mating, balls, that, form, at, the, den, when, females, enter, the, mating, melee, a, snake, hatch, can, include, as, many, as, 57, young, garter, snakes, use, the, vomeronasal, organ, to, communicate, via, pheromones, through, tongue, flicking, which, gathers, chemical, cues, in, the, environment, upon, entering, the, lumen, of, the, organ, the, chemical, molecules, will, come, into, contact, with, the, sensory, cells, which, are, attached, to, the, neurosensory, epithelium, of, the, vomeronasal, organ, if, disturbed, a, garter, snake, may, coil, and, strike, but, it, typically, hides, its, head, and, flails, its, tail, these, snakes, will, also, discharge, a, malodorous, musky, scented, secretion, from, a, gland, near, the, cloaca, this, secretion, from, north, american, garter, snakes, contains, seven, highly, odoriferous, volatile, components, acetic, propanoic, 2, methylpropanoic, butanoic, and, 3, methylbutanoic, acids, and, trimethylamine, and, 2, piperidone, they, often, use, these, techniques, to, escape, when, ensnared, by, a, predator, they, will, also, slither, into, the, water, to, escape, a, predator, on, land, hawks, crows, egrets, herons, cranes, raccoons, otters, and, other, snake, species, such, as, coral, snakes, and, kingsnakes, will, eat, garter, snakes, with, even, shrews, and, frogs, eating, the, juveniles, being, heterothermic, like, all, reptiles, garter, snakes, bask, in, the, sun, to, regulate, their, body, temperature, during, brumation, the, reptile, equivalent, of, hibernation, garter, snakes, typically, occupy, large, communal, sites, called, hibernacula, these, snakes, will, migrate, large, distances, to, brumate, a, long, term, study, by, the, ontario, ministry, of, transportation, has, shed, light, on, the, social, behavior, of, butler, s, garter, snakes, the, study, conducted, in, a, 250, hectare, area, near, windsor, canada, tracked, over, 3, 000, individual, snakes, over, a, 12, year, period, the, findings, challenge, previous, assumptions, about, solitary, snake, behavior, and, suggest, that, these, snakes, form, social, groups, and, communities, the, study, revealed, that, butler, s, garter, snakes, do, not, wander, randomly, but, instead, tend, to, associate, with, specific, groups, of, snakes, these, groups, typically, consist, of, three, to, four, individuals, with, some, larger, groups, reaching, up, to, 46, snakes, garter, snakes, like, all, snakes, are, carnivorous, their, diet, consists, of, almost, any, creature, they, are, capable, of, overpowering, slugs, earthworms, nightcrawlers, as, redworms, are, toxic, to, garter, snakes, leeches, lizards, amphibians, including, frog, eggs, minnows, and, rodents, when, living, near, water, they, eat, other, aquatic, animals, the, ribbon, snake, thamnophis, saurita, in, particular, favors, frogs, including, tadpoles, readily, eating, them, despite, their, strong, chemical, defenses, food, is, swallowed, whole, garter, snakes, often, adapt, to, eating, whatever, they, can, find, and, whenever, they, can, find, it, because, food, can, be, either, scarce, or, abundant, although, they, feed, mostly, on, live, animals, they, will, sometimes, eat, eggs, garter, snakes, were, long, thought, to, be, non, venomous, but, discoveries, in, the, early, 2000s, revealed, that, they, produce, a, neurotoxic, venom, despite, this, garter, snakes, cannot, seriously, injure, or, kill, humans, with, the, small, amounts, of, comparatively, mild, venom, they, produce, and, they, also, lack, an, effective, means, of, delivering, it, in, a, few, cases, some, swelling, and, bruising, has, been, reported, they, do, have, enlarged, teeth, in, the, back, of, their, mouth, but, their, gums, are, significantly, larger, and, the, secretions, of, their, duvernoy, s, gland, are, only, mildly, toxic, evidence, suggests, that, garter, snake, and, newt, populations, share, an, evolutionary, link, in, their, tetrodotoxin, resistance, levels, implying, co, evolution, between, predator, and, prey, garter, snakes, feeding, on, toxic, newts, can, also, retain, those, toxins, in, their, liver, for, weeks, making, those, snakes, poisonous, as, well, as, venomous, despite, the, decline, in, their, population, from, collection, as, pets, especially, in, the, more, northerly, regions, in, which, large, groups, are, collected, at, hibernation, pollution, of, aquatic, areas, and, the, introduction, of, american, bullfrogs, as, potential, predators, garter, snakes, are, still, some, of, the, most, commonly, found, reptiles, in, much, of, their, ranges, the, san, francisco, garter, snake, thamnophis, sirtalis, tetrataenia, however, has, been, on, the, endangered, list, since, 1969, predation, by, crayfish, has, also, been, responsible, for, the, decline, of, the, narrow, headed, garter, snake, thamnophis, rufipunctatus, many, breeders, have, bred, all, species, of, garter, snakes, making, it, a, popular, breed, arranged, alphabetically, by, scientific, name, in, the, above, list, a, binomial, authority, or, a, trinomial, authority, in, parentheses, indicates, that, the, species, or, subspecies, was, originally, described, in, a, genus, other, than, thamnophis
