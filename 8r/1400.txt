anthrax, is, an, infection, caused, by, the, bacterium, bacillus, anthracis, infection, typically, occurs, by, contact, with, the, skin, inhalation, or, intestinal, absorption, symptom, onset, occurs, between, one, day, and, more, than, two, months, after, the, infection, is, contracted, the, skin, form, presents, with, a, small, blister, with, surrounding, swelling, that, often, turns, into, a, painless, ulcer, with, a, black, center, the, inhalation, form, presents, with, fever, chest, pain, and, shortness, of, breath, the, intestinal, form, presents, with, diarrhea, which, may, contain, blood, abdominal, pains, nausea, and, vomiting, according, to, the, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, the, first, clinical, descriptions, of, cutaneous, anthrax, were, given, by, maret, in, 1752, and, fournier, in, 1769, before, that, anthrax, had, been, described, only, in, historical, accounts, the, german, scientist, robert, koch, was, the, first, to, identify, bacillus, anthracis, as, the, bacterium, that, causes, anthrax, anthrax, is, spread, by, contact, with, the, bacterium, s, spores, which, often, appear, in, infectious, animal, products, contact, is, by, breathing, or, eating, or, through, an, area, of, broken, skin, it, does, not, typically, spread, directly, between, people, risk, factors, include, people, who, work, with, animals, or, animal, products, and, military, personnel, diagnosis, can, be, confirmed, by, finding, antibodies, or, the, toxin, in, the, blood, or, by, culture, of, a, sample, from, the, infected, site, anthrax, vaccination, is, recommended, for, people, at, high, risk, of, infection, immunizing, animals, against, anthrax, is, recommended, in, areas, where, previous, infections, have, occurred, a, two, month, course, of, antibiotics, such, as, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and, doxycycline, after, exposure, can, also, prevent, infection, if, infection, occurs, treatment, is, with, antibiotics, and, possibly, antitoxin, the, type, and, number, of, antibiotics, used, depend, on, the, type, of, infection, antitoxin, is, recommended, for, those, with, widespread, infection, a, rare, disease, human, anthrax, is, most, common, in, africa, and, central, and, southern, asia, it, also, occurs, more, regularly, in, southern, europe, than, elsewhere, on, the, continent, and, is, uncommon, in, northern, europe, and, north, america, globally, at, least, 2, 000, cases, occur, a, year, with, about, two, cases, a, year, in, the, united, states, skin, infections, represent, more, than, 95, of, cases, without, treatment, the, risk, of, death, from, skin, anthrax, is, 23, 7, for, intestinal, infection, the, risk, of, death, is, 25, to, 75, while, respiratory, anthrax, has, a, mortality, of, 50, to, 80, even, with, treatment, until, the, 20th, century, anthrax, infections, killed, hundreds, of, thousands, of, people, and, animals, each, year, in, herbivorous, animals, infection, occurs, when, they, eat, or, breathe, in, the, spores, while, grazing, animals, may, become, infected, by, killing, and, or, eating, infected, animals, several, countries, have, developed, anthrax, as, a, weapon, it, has, been, used, in, biowarfare, and, bioterrorism, since, 1914, in, 1975, the, biological, weapons, convention, prohibited, the, development, production, and, stockpiling, of, biological, weapons, it, has, since, been, used, in, bioterrorism, likely, delivery, methods, of, weaponized, anthrax, include, aerial, dispersal, or, dispersal, through, livestock, notable, bioterrorism, uses, include, the, 2001, anthrax, attacks, and, an, incident, in, 1993, by, the, aum, shinrikyo, group, the, english, name, comes, from, anthrax, the, greek, word, for, coal, possibly, having, egyptian, etymology, because, of, the, characteristic, black, skin, lesions, people, with, a, cutaneous, anthrax, infection, develop, the, central, black, eschar, surrounded, by, vivid, red, skin, has, long, been, recognised, as, typical, of, the, disease, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, word, anthrax, in, english, is, in, a, 1398, translation, of, bartholomaeus, anglicus, s, work, de, proprietatibus, rerum, on, the, properties, of, things, 1240, anthrax, was, historically, known, by, a, wide, variety, of, names, indicating, its, symptoms, location, and, groups, considered, most, vulnerable, to, infection, they, include, siberian, plague, cumberland, disease, charbon, splenic, fever, malignant, edema, woolsorter, s, disease, and, la, maladie, de, bradford, cutaneous, anthrax, also, known, as, hide, porter, s, disease, is, when, anthrax, occurs, on, the, skin, it, is, the, most, common, 90, of, cases, and, least, dangerous, form, low, mortality, with, treatment, 23, 7, mortality, without, cutaneous, anthrax, presents, as, a, boil, like, skin, lesion, that, eventually, forms, an, ulcer, with, a, black, center, eschar, the, black, eschar, often, shows, up, as, a, large, painless, necrotic, ulcer, beginning, as, an, irritating, and, itchy, skin, lesion, or, blister, that, is, dark, and, usually, concentrated, as, a, black, dot, somewhat, resembling, bread, mold, at, the, site, of, infection, in, general, cutaneous, infections, form, within, the, site, of, spore, penetration, two, to, five, days, after, exposure, unlike, bruises, or, most, other, lesions, cutaneous, anthrax, infections, normally, do, not, cause, pain, nearby, lymph, nodes, may, become, infected, reddened, swollen, and, painful, a, scab, forms, over, the, lesion, soon, and, falls, off, in, a, few, weeks, complete, recovery, may, take, longer, cutaneous, anthrax, is, typically, caused, when, b, anthracis, spores, enter, through, cuts, on, the, skin, this, form, is, found, most, commonly, when, humans, handle, infected, animals, and, or, animal, products, in, december, 2009, an, outbreak, of, anthrax, occurred, among, injecting, heroin, users, in, the, glasgow, and, stirling, areas, of, scotland, resulting, in, 14, deaths, it, was, the, first, documented, non, occupational, human, anthrax, outbreak, in, the, uk, since, 1960, the, source, of, the, anthrax, is, believed, to, have, been, dilution, of, the, heroin, with, bone, meal, in, afghanistan, injected, anthrax, may, have, symptoms, similar, to, cutaneous, anthrax, with, the, exception, of, black, areas, and, may, also, cause, infection, deep, into, the, muscle, and, spread, faster, this, can, make, it, harder, to, recognise, and, treat, inhalation, anthrax, usually, develops, within, a, week, after, exposure, but, may, take, up, to, 2, months, during, the, first, few, days, of, illness, most, people, have, fever, chills, and, fatigue, these, symptoms, may, be, accompanied, by, cough, shortness, of, breath, chest, pain, and, nausea, or, vomiting, making, inhalation, anthrax, difficult, to, distinguish, from, influenza, and, community, acquired, pneumonia, this, is, often, described, as, the, prodromal, period, over, the, next, day, or, so, shortness, of, breath, cough, and, chest, pain, become, more, common, and, complaints, not, involving, the, chest, such, as, nausea, vomiting, altered, mental, status, sweats, and, headache, develop, in, one, third, or, more, of, people, upper, respiratory, tract, symptoms, occur, in, only, a, quarter, of, people, and, muscle, pains, are, rare, altered, mental, status, or, shortness, of, breath, generally, brings, people, to, healthcare, and, marks, the, fulminant, phase, of, illness, it, infects, the, lymph, nodes, in, the, chest, first, rather, than, the, lungs, themselves, a, condition, called, hemorrhagic, mediastinitis, causing, bloody, fluid, to, accumulate, in, the, chest, cavity, thereby, causing, shortness, of, breath, the, second, pneumonia, stage, occurs, when, the, infection, spreads, from, the, lymph, nodes, to, the, lungs, symptoms, of, the, second, stage, develop, suddenly, within, hours, or, days, after, the, first, stage, symptoms, include, high, fever, extreme, shortness, of, breath, shock, and, rapid, death, within, 48, hours, in, fatal, cases, gastrointestinal, gi, infection, is, most, often, caused, by, consuming, anthrax, infected, meat, and, is, characterized, by, diarrhea, potentially, with, blood, abdominal, pains, acute, inflammation, of, the, intestinal, tract, and, loss, of, appetite, occasional, vomiting, of, blood, can, occur, lesions, have, been, found, in, the, intestines, and, in, the, mouth, and, throat, after, the, bacterium, invades, the, gastrointestinal, system, it, spreads, to, the, bloodstream, and, throughout, the, body, while, continuing, to, make, toxins, bacillus, anthracis, is, a, rod, shaped, gram, positive, facultative, anaerobe, bacterium, about, 1, by, 9, m, in, size, it, was, shown, to, cause, disease, by, robert, koch, in, 1876, when, he, took, a, blood, sample, from, an, infected, cow, isolated, the, bacteria, and, put, them, into, a, mouse, the, bacterium, normally, rests, in, spore, form, in, the, soil, and, can, survive, for, decades, in, this, state, herbivores, are, often, infected, while, grazing, especially, when, eating, rough, irritant, or, spiky, vegetation, the, vegetation, has, been, hypothesized, to, cause, wounds, within, the, gastrointestinal, tract, permitting, entry, of, the, bacterial, spores, into, the, tissues, once, ingested, or, placed, in, an, open, wound, the, bacteria, begin, multiplying, inside, the, animal, or, human, and, typically, kill, the, host, within, a, few, days, or, weeks, the, spores, germinate, at, the, site, of, entry, into, the, tissues, and, then, spread, by, the, circulation, to, the, lymphatics, where, the, bacteria, multiply, the, production, of, two, powerful, exotoxins, and, lethal, toxin, by, the, bacteria, causes, death, veterinarians, can, often, tell, a, possible, anthrax, induced, death, by, its, sudden, occurrence, and, the, dark, nonclotting, blood, that, oozes, from, the, body, orifices, most, anthrax, bacteria, inside, the, body, after, death, are, outcompeted, and, destroyed, by, anaerobic, bacteria, within, minutes, to, hours, post, mortem, but, anthrax, vegetative, bacteria, that, escape, the, body, via, oozing, blood, or, opening, the, carcass, may, form, hardy, spores, these, vegetative, bacteria, are, not, contagious, one, spore, forms, per, vegetative, bacterium, the, triggers, for, spore, formation, are, not, known, but, oxygen, tension, and, lack, of, nutrients, may, play, roles, once, formed, these, spores, are, very, hard, to, eradicate, the, infection, of, herbivores, and, occasionally, humans, by, inhalation, normally, begins, with, inhaled, spores, being, transported, through, the, air, passages, into, the, tiny, air, sacs, alveoli, in, the, lungs, the, spores, are, then, picked, up, by, scavenger, cells, macrophages, in, the, lungs, and, transported, through, small, vessels, lymphatics, to, the, lymph, nodes, in, the, central, chest, cavity, mediastinum, damage, caused, by, the, anthrax, spores, and, bacilli, to, the, central, chest, cavity, can, cause, chest, pain, and, difficulty, breathing, once, in, the, lymph, nodes, the, spores, germinate, into, active, bacilli, that, multiply, and, eventually, burst, the, macrophages, releasing, many, more, bacilli, into, the, bloodstream, to, be, transferred, to, the, entire, body, once, in, the, bloodstream, these, bacilli, release, three, proteins, lethal, factor, edema, factor, and, protective, antigen, the, three, are, not, toxic, by, themselves, but, their, combination, is, incredibly, lethal, to, humans, protective, antigen, combines, with, these, other, two, factors, to, form, lethal, toxin, and, edema, toxin, respectively, these, toxins, are, the, primary, agents, of, tissue, destruction, bleeding, and, death, of, the, host, if, antibiotics, are, administered, too, late, even, if, the, antibiotics, eradicate, the, bacteria, some, hosts, still, die, of, toxemia, because, the, toxins, produced, by, the, bacilli, remain, in, their, systems, at, lethal, dose, levels, anthrax, can, enter, the, human, body, through, the, intestines, gastrointestinal, lungs, pulmonary, or, skin, cutaneous, and, causes, distinct, clinical, symptoms, based, on, its, site, of, entry, anthrax, does, not, usually, spread, from, an, infected, human, to, an, uninfected, human, if, the, disease, is, fatal, to, the, person, s, body, its, mass, of, anthrax, bacilli, becomes, a, potential, source, of, infection, to, others, and, special, precautions, should, be, used, to, prevent, further, contamination, pulmonary, anthrax, if, left, untreated, is, almost, always, fatal, historically, pulmonary, anthrax, was, called, woolsorters, disease, because, it, was, an, occupational, hazard, for, people, who, sorted, wool, today, this, form, of, infection, is, extremely, rare, in, industrialized, nations, cutaneous, anthrax, is, the, most, common, form, of, transmission, but, also, the, least, dangerous, of, the, three, transmissions, gastrointestinal, anthrax, is, likely, fatal, if, left, untreated, but, very, rare, the, spores, of, anthrax, are, able, to, survive, in, harsh, conditions, for, decades, or, even, centuries, such, spores, can, be, found, on, all, continents, including, antarctica, disturbed, grave, sites, of, infected, animals, have, been, known, to, cause, infection, after, 70, years, in, one, such, event, a, young, boy, died, from, gastrointestinal, anthrax, due, to, the, thawing, of, reindeer, corpses, from, 75, years, before, contact, anthrax, spores, traveled, though, groundwater, used, for, drinking, and, caused, tens, of, people, to, be, hospitalized, largely, children, occupational, exposure, to, infected, animals, or, their, products, such, as, skin, wool, and, meat, is, the, usual, pathway, of, exposure, for, humans, workers, exposed, to, dead, animals, and, animal, products, are, at, the, highest, risk, especially, in, countries, where, anthrax, is, more, common, anthrax, in, livestock, grazing, on, open, range, where, they, mix, with, wild, animals, still, occasionally, occurs, in, the, u, s, and, elsewhere, many, workers, who, deal, with, wool, and, animal, hides, are, routinely, exposed, to, low, levels, of, anthrax, spores, but, most, exposure, levels, are, not, sufficient, to, produce, infection, a, lethal, infection, is, reported, to, result, from, inhalation, of, about, 10, 000, 20, 000, spores, though, this, dose, varies, among, host, species, the, lethality, of, the, anthrax, disease, is, due, to, the, bacterium, s, two, principal, virulence, factors, the, poly, d, glutamic, acid, capsule, which, protects, the, bacterium, from, phagocytosis, by, host, neutrophils, and, the, tripartite, protein, toxin, called, anthrax, toxin, consisting, of, protective, antigen, pa, edema, factor, ef, and, lethal, factor, lf, pa, plus, lf, produces, lethal, toxin, and, pa, plus, ef, produces, edema, toxin, these, toxins, cause, death, and, tissue, swelling, edema, respectively, to, enter, the, cells, the, edema, and, lethal, factors, use, another, protein, produced, by, b, anthracis, called, protective, antigen, which, binds, to, two, surface, receptors, on, the, host, cell, a, cell, protease, then, cleaves, pa, into, two, fragments, pa, 20, and, pa, 63, pa, 20, dissociates, into, the, extracellular, medium, playing, no, further, role, in, the, toxic, cycle, pa, 63, then, oligomerizes, with, six, other, pa, 63, fragments, forming, a, heptameric, ring, shaped, structure, named, a, prepore, once, in, this, shape, the, complex, can, competitively, bind, up, to, three, efs, or, lfs, forming, a, resistant, complex, receptor, mediated, endocytosis, occurs, next, providing, the, newly, formed, toxic, complex, access, to, the, interior, of, the, host, cell, the, acidified, environment, within, the, endosome, triggers, the, heptamer, to, release, the, lf, and, or, ef, into, the, cytosol, it, is, unknown, how, exactly, the, complex, results, in, the, death, of, the, cell, edema, factor, is, a, calmodulin, dependent, adenylate, cyclase, adenylate, cyclase, catalyzes, the, conversion, of, atp, into, cyclic, amp, camp, and, pyrophosphate, the, complexation, of, adenylate, cyclase, with, calmodulin, removes, calmodulin, from, stimulating, calcium, triggered, signaling, thus, inhibiting, the, immune, response, to, be, specific, lf, inactivates, neutrophils, a, type, of, phagocytic, cell, by, the, process, just, described, so, they, cannot, phagocytose, bacteria, throughout, history, lethal, factor, was, presumed, to, cause, macrophages, to, make, tnf, alpha, and, interleukin, 1, beta, il1b, tnf, alpha, is, a, cytokine, whose, primary, role, is, to, regulate, immune, cells, as, well, as, to, induce, inflammation, and, apoptosis, or, programmed, cell, death, interleukin, 1, beta, is, another, cytokine, that, also, regulates, inflammation, and, apoptosis, the, overproduction, of, tnf, alpha, and, il1b, ultimately, leads, to, septic, shock, and, death, however, recent, evidence, indicates, anthrax, also, targets, endothelial, cells, that, line, serious, cavities, such, as, the, pericardial, cavity, pleural, cavity, and, peritoneal, cavity, lymph, vessels, and, blood, vessels, causing, vascular, leakage, of, fluid, and, cells, and, ultimately, hypovolemic, shock, and, septic, shock, various, techniques, may, be, used, for, the, direct, identification, of, b, anthracis, in, clinical, material, firstly, specimens, may, be, gram, stained, bacillus, spp, are, quite, large, in, size, 3, to, 4, m, long, they, may, grow, in, long, chains, and, they, stain, gram, positive, to, confirm, the, organism, is, b, anthracis, rapid, diagnostic, techniques, such, as, polymerase, chain, reaction, based, assays, and, immunofluorescence, microscopy, may, be, used, all, bacillus, species, grow, well, on, 5, sheep, blood, agar, and, other, routine, culture, media, polymyxin, lysozyme, edta, thallous, acetate, can, be, used, to, isolate, b, anthracis, from, contaminated, specimens, and, bicarbonate, agar, is, used, as, an, identification, method, to, induce, capsule, formation, bacillus, spp, usually, grow, within, 24, hours, of, incubation, at, 35, c, in, ambient, air, room, temperature, or, in, 5, co, 2, if, bicarbonate, agar, is, used, for, identification, then, the, medium, must, be, incubated, in, 5, co, 2, b, anthracis, colonies, are, medium, large, gray, flat, and, irregular, with, swirling, projections, often, referred, to, as, having, a, medusa, head, appearance, and, are, not, hemolytic, on, 5, sheep, blood, agar, the, bacteria, are, not, motile, susceptible, to, penicillin, and, produce, a, wide, zone, of, lecithinase, on, egg, yolk, agar, confirmatory, testing, to, identify, b, anthracis, includes, gamma, bacteriophage, testing, indirect, hemagglutination, and, enzyme, linked, immunosorbent, assay, to, detect, antibodies, the, best, confirmatory, precipitation, test, for, anthrax, is, the, ascoli, test, precautions, are, taken, to, avoid, contact, with, the, skin, and, any, fluids, exuded, through, natural, body, openings, of, a, deceased, body, that, is, suspected, of, harboring, anthrax, the, body, should, be, put, in, strict, quarantine, a, blood, sample, is, collected, and, sealed, in, a, container, and, analyzed, in, an, approved, laboratory, to, ascertain, if, anthrax, is, the, cause, of, death, the, body, should, be, sealed, in, an, airtight, body, bag, and, incinerated, to, prevent, the, transmission, of, anthrax, spores, microscopic, visualization, of, the, encapsulated, bacilli, usually, in, very, large, numbers, in, a, blood, smear, stained, with, polychrome, methylene, blue, mcfadyean, stain, is, fully, diagnostic, though, the, culture, of, the, organism, is, still, the, gold, standard, for, diagnosis, full, isolation, of, the, body, is, important, to, prevent, possible, contamination, of, others, protective, impermeable, clothing, and, equipment, such, as, rubber, gloves, rubber, apron, and, rubber, boots, with, no, perforations, are, used, when, handling, the, body, no, skin, especially, if, it, has, any, wounds, or, scratches, should, be, exposed, disposable, personal, protective, equipment, is, preferable, but, if, not, available, decontamination, can, be, achieved, by, autoclaving, used, disposable, equipment, is, burned, and, or, buried, after, use, all, contaminated, bedding, or, clothing, is, isolated, in, double, plastic, bags, and, treated, as, biohazard, waste, respiratory, equipment, capable, of, filtering, small, particles, such, the, us, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, and, mine, safety, and, health, administration, approved, high, efficiency, respirator, is, worn, by, addressing, anthrax, from, a, one, health, perspective, we, can, reduce, the, risks, of, transmission, and, better, protect, both, human, and, animal, populations, the, prevention, of, anthrax, from, the, environmental, sources, like, air, water, soil, is, disinfection, used, by, effective, microorganisms, thru, spraying, and, bokashi, mudballs, mixed, with, effective, microorganisms, for, the, contaminated, waterways, vaccines, against, anthrax, for, use, in, livestock, and, humans, have, had, a, prominent, place, in, the, history, of, medicine, the, french, scientist, louis, pasteur, developed, the, first, effective, vaccine, in, 1881, human, anthrax, vaccines, were, developed, by, the, soviet, union, in, the, late, 1930s, and, in, the, us, and, uk, in, the, 1950s, the, current, fda, approved, us, vaccine, was, formulated, in, the, 1960s, currently, administered, human, anthrax, vaccines, include, acellular, subunit, vaccine, united, states, and, live, vaccine, russia, varieties, all, currently, used, anthrax, vaccines, show, considerable, local, and, general, reactogenicity, erythema, induration, soreness, fever, and, serious, adverse, reactions, occur, in, about, 1, of, recipients, the, american, product, biothrax, is, licensed, by, the, fda, and, was, formerly, administered, in, a, six, dose, primary, series, at, 0, 2, 4, weeks, and, 6, 12, 18, months, with, annual, boosters, to, maintain, immunity, in, 2008, the, fda, approved, omitting, the, week, 2, dose, resulting, in, the, currently, recommended, five, dose, series, this, five, dose, series, is, available, to, military, personnel, scientists, who, work, with, anthrax, and, members, of, the, public, who, do, jobs, which, cause, them, to, be, at, risk, new, second, generation, vaccines, currently, being, researched, include, recombinant, live, vaccines, and, recombinant, subunit, vaccines, in, the, 20th, century, the, use, of, a, modern, product, biothrax, to, protect, american, troops, against, the, use, of, anthrax, in, biological, warfare, was, controversial, preventive, antibiotics, are, recommended, in, those, who, have, been, exposed, early, detection, of, sources, of, anthrax, infection, can, allow, preventive, measures, to, be, taken, in, response, to, the, anthrax, attacks, of, october, 2001, the, united, states, postal, service, usps, installed, biodetection, systems, bdss, in, their, large, scale, mail, processing, facilities, bds, response, plans, were, formulated, by, the, usps, in, conjunction, with, local, responders, including, fire, police, hospitals, and, public, health, employees, of, these, facilities, have, been, educated, about, anthrax, response, actions, and, prophylactic, medication, because, of, the, time, delay, inherent, in, getting, final, verification, that, anthrax, has, been, used, prophylactic, antibiotic, treatment, of, possibly, exposed, personnel, must, be, started, as, soon, as, possible, anthrax, cannot, be, spread, from, person, to, person, except, in, the, rare, case, of, skin, exudates, from, cutaneous, anthrax, however, a, person, s, clothing, and, body, may, be, contaminated, with, anthrax, spores, effective, decontamination, of, people, can, be, accomplished, by, a, thorough, wash, down, with, antimicrobial, soap, and, water, wastewater, is, treated, with, bleach, or, another, antimicrobial, agent, effective, decontamination, of, articles, can, be, accomplished, by, boiling, them, in, water, for, 30, minutes, or, longer, chlorine, bleach, is, ineffective, in, destroying, spores, and, vegetative, cells, on, surfaces, though, formaldehyde, is, effective, burning, clothing, is, very, effective, in, destroying, spores, after, decontamination, there, is, no, need, to, immunize, treat, or, isolate, contacts, of, persons, ill, with, anthrax, unless, they, were, also, exposed, to, the, same, source, of, infection, early, antibiotic, treatment, of, anthrax, is, essential, delay, significantly, lessens, chances, for, survival, treatment, for, anthrax, infection, and, other, bacterial, infections, includes, large, doses, of, intravenous, and, oral, antibiotics, such, as, fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, erythromycin, vancomycin, or, penicillin, fda, approved, agents, include, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and, penicillin, in, possible, cases, of, pulmonary, anthrax, early, antibiotic, prophylaxis, treatment, is, crucial, to, prevent, possible, death, many, attempts, have, been, made, to, develop, new, drugs, against, anthrax, but, existing, drugs, are, effective, if, treatment, is, started, soon, enough, in, may, 2009, human, genome, sciences, submitted, a, biologic, license, application, bla, permission, to, market, for, its, new, drug, raxibacumab, brand, name, abthrax, intended, for, emergency, treatment, of, inhaled, anthrax, on, 14, december, 2012, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, approved, raxibacumab, injection, to, treat, inhalational, anthrax, raxibacumab, is, a, monoclonal, antibody, that, neutralizes, toxins, produced, by, b, anthracis, in, march, 2016, fda, approved, a, second, anthrax, treatment, using, a, monoclonal, antibody, which, neutralizes, the, toxins, produced, by, b, anthracis, obiltoxaximab, is, approved, to, treat, inhalational, anthrax, in, conjunction, with, appropriate, antibacterial, drugs, and, for, prevention, when, alternative, therapies, are, not, available, or, appropriate, cutaneous, anthrax, is, rarely, fatal, if, treated, because, the, infection, area, is, limited, to, the, skin, preventing, the, lethal, factor, edema, factor, and, protective, antigen, from, entering, and, destroying, a, vital, organ, without, treatment, up, to, 20, of, cutaneous, skin, infection, cases, progress, to, toxemia, and, death, before, 2001, fatality, rates, for, inhalation, anthrax, were, 90, since, then, they, have, fallen, to, 45, people, that, progress, to, the, fulminant, phase, of, inhalational, anthrax, nearly, always, die, with, one, case, study, showing, a, death, rate, of, 97, anthrax, meningoencephalitis, is, also, nearly, always, fatal, gastrointestinal, anthrax, infections, can, be, treated, but, usually, result, in, fatality, rates, of, 25, to, 60, depending, upon, how, soon, treatment, commences, injection, anthrax, is, the, rarest, form, of, anthrax, and, has, only, been, seen, to, have, occurred, in, a, group, of, heroin, injecting, drug, users, anthrax, a, bacterial, disease, caused, by, bacillus, anthracis, can, have, devastating, effects, on, animals, it, primarily, affects, herbivores, such, as, cattle, sheep, and, goats, but, a, wide, range, of, mammals, birds, and, even, humans, can, also, be, susceptible, infection, typically, occurs, through, the, ingestion, of, spores, in, contaminated, soil, or, plants, once, inside, the, host, the, spores, transform, into, active, bacteria, producing, lethal, toxins, that, lead, to, severe, symptoms, infected, animals, often, exhibit, high, fever, rapid, breathing, and, convulsions, and, they, may, succumb, to, the, disease, within, hours, to, days, the, presence, of, anthrax, can, pose, significant, challenges, to, livestock, management, and, wildlife, conservation, efforts, making, it, a, critical, concern, for, both, animal, health, and, public, health, as, it, can, occasionally, be, transmitted, to, humans, through, contact, with, infected, animals, or, contaminated, products, infected, animals, may, stagger, have, difficulty, breathing, tremble, and, finally, collapse, and, die, within, a, few, hours, globally, at, least, 2, 000, cases, occur, a, year, the, last, fatal, case, of, natural, inhalational, anthrax, in, the, united, states, occurred, in, california, in, 1976, when, a, home, weaver, died, after, working, with, infected, wool, imported, from, pakistan, to, minimize, the, chance, of, spreading, the, disease, the, body, was, transported, to, ucla, in, a, sealed, plastic, body, bag, within, a, sealed, metal, container, for, autopsy, gastrointestinal, anthrax, is, exceedingly, rare, in, the, united, states, with, only, two, cases, on, record, the, first, case, was, reported, in, 1942, according, to, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, during, december, 2009, the, new, hampshire, department, of, health, and, human, services, confirmed, a, case, of, gastrointestinal, anthrax, in, an, adult, female, the, cdc, investigated, the, source, and, the, possibility, that, it, was, contracted, from, an, african, drum, recently, used, by, the, woman, taking, part, in, a, drum, circle, the, woman, apparently, inhaled, anthrax, in, spore, form, from, the, hide, of, the, drum, she, became, critically, ill, but, with, gastrointestinal, anthrax, rather, than, inhaled, anthrax, which, made, her, unique, in, american, medical, history, the, building, where, the, infection, took, place, was, cleaned, and, reopened, to, the, public, and, the, woman, recovered, the, new, hampshire, state, epidemiologist, jodie, dionne, odom, stated, it, is, a, mystery, we, really, don, t, know, why, it, happened, in, 2007, two, cases, of, cutaneous, anthrax, were, reported, in, danbury, connecticut, the, case, involved, a, maker, of, traditional, african, style, drums, who, was, working, with, a, goat, hide, purchased, from, a, dealer, in, new, york, city, which, had, been, previously, cleared, by, customs, while, the, hide, was, being, scraped, a, spider, bite, led, to, the, spores, entering, the, bloodstream, his, son, also, became, infected, in, july, 2022, dozens, of, cattle, in, a, nature, park, in, lonjsko, polje, a, flood, plain, by, the, sava, river, died, of, anthrax, and, 6, people, have, been, hospitalized, with, light, skin, related, symptoms, in, november, 2008, a, drum, maker, in, the, united, kingdom, who, worked, with, untreated, animal, skins, died, from, anthrax, in, december, 2009, an, outbreak, of, anthrax, occurred, among, heroin, addicts, in, the, glasgow, and, stirling, areas, of, scotland, resulting, in, 14, deaths, the, source, of, the, anthrax, is, believed, to, have, been, dilution, of, the, heroin, with, bone, meal, in, afghanistan, robert, koch, a, german, physician, and, scientist, first, identified, the, bacterium, that, caused, the, anthrax, disease, in, 1875, in, wollstein, now, wolsztyn, poland, his, pioneering, work, in, the, late, 19th, century, was, one, of, the, first, demonstrations, that, diseases, could, be, caused, by, microbes, in, a, groundbreaking, series, of, experiments, he, uncovered, the, lifecycle, and, means, of, transmission, of, anthrax, his, experiments, not, only, helped, create, an, understanding, of, anthrax, but, also, helped, elucidate, the, role, of, microbes, in, causing, illness, at, a, time, when, debates, still, took, place, over, spontaneous, generation, versus, cell, theory, koch, went, on, to, study, the, mechanisms, of, other, diseases, and, won, the, 1905, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, his, discovery, of, the, bacterium, causing, tuberculosis, although, koch, arguably, made, the, greatest, theoretical, contribution, to, understanding, anthrax, other, researchers, were, more, concerned, with, the, practical, questions, of, how, to, prevent, the, disease, in, britain, where, anthrax, affected, workers, in, the, wool, worsted, hides, and, tanning, industries, it, was, viewed, with, fear, john, henry, bell, a, doctor, born, based, in, bradford, first, made, the, link, between, the, mysterious, and, deadly, woolsorter, s, disease, and, anthrax, showing, in, 1878, that, they, were, one, and, the, same, in, the, early, 20th, century, friederich, wilhelm, eurich, the, german, bacteriologist, who, settled, in, bradford, with, his, family, as, a, child, carried, out, important, research, for, the, local, anthrax, investigation, board, eurich, also, made, valuable, contributions, to, a, home, office, departmental, committee, of, inquiry, established, in, 1913, to, address, the, continuing, problem, of, industrial, anthrax, his, work, in, this, capacity, much, of, it, collaboration, with, the, factory, inspector, g, elmhirst, duckering, led, directly, to, the, anthrax, prevention, act, 1919, anthrax, posed, a, major, economic, challenge, in, france, and, elsewhere, during, the, 19th, century, horses, cattle, and, sheep, were, particularly, vulnerable, and, national, funds, were, set, aside, to, investigate, the, production, of, a, vaccine, french, scientist, louis, pasteur, was, charged, with, the, production, of, a, vaccine, following, his, successful, work, in, developing, methods, that, helped, to, protect, the, important, wine, and, silk, industries, in, may, 1881, pasteur, in, collaboration, with, his, assistants, jean, joseph, henri, toussaint, mile, roux, and, others, performed, a, public, experiment, at, pouilly, le, fort, to, demonstrate, his, concept, of, vaccination, he, prepared, two, groups, of, 25, sheep, one, goat, and, several, cattle, the, animals, of, one, group, were, twice, injected, with, an, anthrax, vaccine, prepared, by, pasteur, at, an, interval, of, 15, days, the, control, group, was, left, unvaccinated, thirty, days, after, the, first, injection, both, groups, were, injected, with, a, culture, of, live, anthrax, bacteria, all, the, animals, in, the, unvaccinated, group, died, while, all, of, the, animals, in, the, vaccinated, group, survived, after, this, apparent, triumph, which, was, widely, reported, in, the, local, national, and, international, press, pasteur, made, strenuous, efforts, to, export, the, vaccine, beyond, france, he, used, his, celebrity, status, to, establish, pasteur, institutes, across, europe, and, asia, and, his, nephew, adrien, loir, travelled, to, australia, in, 1888, to, try, to, introduce, the, vaccine, to, combat, anthrax, in, new, south, wales, ultimately, the, vaccine, was, unsuccessful, in, the, challenging, climate, of, rural, australia, and, it, was, soon, superseded, by, a, more, robust, version, developed, by, local, researchers, john, gunn, and, john, mcgarvie, smith, the, human, vaccine, for, anthrax, became, available, in, 1954, this, was, a, cell, free, vaccine, instead, of, the, live, cell, pasteur, style, vaccine, used, for, veterinary, purposes, an, improved, cell, free, vaccine, became, available, in, 1970, anthrax, spores, can, survive, for, very, long, periods, of, time, in, the, environment, after, release, chemical, methods, for, cleaning, anthrax, contaminated, sites, or, materials, may, use, oxidizing, agents, such, as, peroxides, ethylene, oxide, sandia, foam, chlorine, dioxide, used, in, the, hart, senate, office, building, peracetic, acid, ozone, gas, hypochlorous, acid, sodium, persulfate, and, liquid, bleach, products, containing, sodium, hypochlorite, nonoxidizing, agents, shown, to, be, effective, for, anthrax, decontamination, include, methyl, bromide, formaldehyde, and, metam, sodium, these, agents, destroy, bacterial, spores, all, of, the, aforementioned, anthrax, decontamination, technologies, have, been, demonstrated, to, be, effective, in, laboratory, tests, conducted, by, the, us, epa, or, others, decontamination, techniques, for, bacillus, anthracis, spores, are, affected, by, the, material, with, which, the, spores, are, associated, environmental, factors, such, as, temperature, and, humidity, and, microbiological, factors, such, as, the, spore, species, anthracis, strain, and, test, methods, used, a, bleach, solution, for, treating, hard, surfaces, has, been, approved, by, the, epa, chlorine, dioxide, has, emerged, as, the, preferred, biocide, against, anthrax, contaminated, sites, having, been, employed, in, the, treatment, of, numerous, government, buildings, over, the, past, decade, its, chief, drawback, is, the, need, for, in, situ, processes, to, have, the, reactant, on, demand, to, speed, the, process, trace, amounts, of, a, nontoxic, catalyst, composed, of, iron, and, tetroamido, macrocyclic, ligands, are, combined, with, sodium, carbonate, and, bicarbonate, and, converted, into, a, spray, the, spray, formula, is, applied, to, an, infested, area, and, is, followed, by, another, spray, containing, tert, butyl, hydroperoxide, using, the, catalyst, method, complete, destruction, of, all, anthrax, spores, can, be, achieved, in, under, 30, minutes, a, standard, catalyst, free, spray, destroys, fewer, than, half, the, spores, in, the, same, amount, of, time, cleanups, at, a, senate, office, building, several, contaminated, postal, facilities, and, other, us, government, and, private, office, buildings, a, collaborative, effort, headed, by, the, environmental, protection, agency, showed, decontamination, to, be, possible, but, time, consuming, and, costly, clearing, the, senate, office, building, of, anthrax, spores, cost, 27, million, according, to, the, government, accountability, office, cleaning, the, brentwood, postal, facility, in, washington, cost, 130, million, and, took, 26, months, since, then, newer, and, less, costly, methods, have, been, developed, cleanup, of, anthrax, contaminated, areas, on, ranches, and, in, the, wild, is, much, more, problematic, carcasses, may, be, burned, though, often, 3, days, are, needed, to, burn, a, large, carcass, and, this, is, not, feasible, in, areas, with, little, wood, carcasses, may, also, be, buried, though, the, burying, of, large, animals, deeply, enough, to, prevent, resurfacing, of, spores, requires, much, manpower, and, expensive, tools, carcasses, have, been, soaked, in, formaldehyde, to, kill, spores, though, this, has, environmental, contamination, issues, block, burning, of, vegetation, in, large, areas, enclosing, an, anthrax, outbreak, has, been, tried, this, while, environmentally, destructive, causes, healthy, animals, to, move, away, from, an, area, with, carcasses, in, search, of, fresh, grass, some, wildlife, workers, have, experimented, with, covering, fresh, anthrax, carcasses, with, shadecloth, and, heavy, objects, this, prevents, some, scavengers, from, opening, the, carcasses, thus, allowing, the, putrefactive, bacteria, within, the, carcass, to, kill, the, vegetative, b, anthracis, cells, and, preventing, sporulation, this, method, also, has, drawbacks, as, scavengers, such, as, hyenas, are, capable, of, infiltrating, almost, any, exclosure, the, experimental, site, at, gruinard, island, is, said, to, have, been, decontaminated, with, a, mixture, of, formaldehyde, and, seawater, by, the, ministry, of, defence, it, is, not, clear, whether, similar, treatments, had, been, applied, to, us, test, sites, anthrax, spores, have, been, used, as, a, biological, warfare, weapon, its, first, modern, incidence, occurred, when, nordic, rebels, supplied, by, the, german, general, staff, used, anthrax, with, unknown, results, against, the, imperial, russian, army, in, finland, in, 1916, anthrax, was, first, tested, as, a, biological, warfare, agent, by, unit, 731, of, the, japanese, kwantung, army, in, manchuria, during, the, 1930s, some, of, this, testing, involved, intentional, infection, of, prisoners, of, war, thousands, of, whom, died, anthrax, designated, at, the, time, as, agent, n, was, also, investigated, by, the, allies, in, the, 1940s, in, 1942, british, scientists, at, porton, down, began, research, on, operation, vegetarian, an, ultimately, unused, biowarfare, military, operation, plan, which, called, for, animal, feed, pellets, containing, linseed, infected, with, anthrax, spores, of, the, vollum, 14578, strain, to, be, dropped, by, air, over, the, countryside, of, nazi, germany, the, pellets, would, be, eaten, by, cattle, which, would, in, turn, be, eaten, by, the, human, population, and, as, such, severally, disrupt, the, german, war, effort, in, the, same, year, bioweapons, tests, were, carried, out, on, the, uninhabited, gruinard, island, in, the, scottish, highlands, with, porton, down, scientists, studying, the, effect, of, anthrax, on, the, island, s, population, of, sheep, ultimately, five, million, pellets, were, created, though, plans, to, drop, them, over, germany, using, royal, air, force, bombers, in, 1944, were, scrapped, after, the, success, of, operation, overlord, and, the, subsequent, allied, liberation, of, france, all, pellets, were, destroyed, using, incinerators, in, 1945, weaponized, anthrax, was, part, of, the, us, stockpile, prior, to, 1972, when, the, united, states, signed, the, biological, weapons, convention, president, nixon, ordered, the, dismantling, of, us, biowarfare, programs, in, 1969, and, the, destruction, of, all, existing, stockpiles, of, bioweapons, in, 1978, 79, the, rhodesian, government, used, anthrax, against, cattle, and, humans, during, its, campaign, against, rebels, the, soviet, union, created, and, stored, 100, to, 200, tons, of, anthrax, spores, at, kantubek, on, vozrozhdeniya, island, they, were, abandoned, in, 1992, and, destroyed, in, 2002, american, military, and, british, army, personnel, are, no, longer, routinely, vaccinated, against, anthrax, prior, to, active, service, in, places, where, biological, attacks, are, considered, a, threat, despite, signing, the, 1972, agreement, to, end, bioweapon, production, the, government, of, the, soviet, union, had, an, active, bioweapons, program, that, included, the, production, of, hundreds, of, tons, of, anthrax, after, this, period, on, 2, april, 1979, some, of, the, over, one, million, people, living, in, sverdlovsk, now, called, ekaterinburg, russia, about, 1, 370, kilometres, 850, mi, east, of, moscow, were, exposed, to, an, accidental, release, of, anthrax, from, a, biological, weapons, complex, located, near, there, at, least, 94, people, were, infected, of, whom, at, least, 68, died, one, victim, died, four, days, after, the, release, 10, over, an, eight, day, period, at, the, peak, of, the, deaths, and, the, last, six, weeks, later, extensive, cleanup, vaccinations, and, medical, interventions, managed, to, save, about, 30, of, the, victims, extensive, cover, ups, and, destruction, of, records, by, the, kgb, continued, from, 1979, until, russian, president, boris, yeltsin, admitted, this, anthrax, accident, in, 1992, jeanne, guillemin, reported, in, 1999, that, a, combined, russian, and, united, states, team, investigated, the, accident, in, 1992, nearly, all, of, the, night, shift, workers, of, a, ceramics, plant, directly, across, the, street, from, the, biological, facility, compound, 19, became, infected, and, most, died, since, most, were, men, some, nato, governments, suspected, the, soviet, union, had, developed, a, sex, specific, weapon, the, government, blamed, the, outbreak, on, the, consumption, of, anthrax, tainted, meat, and, ordered, the, confiscation, of, all, uninspected, meat, that, entered, the, city, they, also, ordered, all, stray, dogs, to, be, shot, and, people, not, have, contact, with, sick, animals, also, a, voluntary, evacuation, and, anthrax, vaccination, program, was, established, for, people, from, 18, to, 55, to, support, the, cover, up, story, soviet, medical, and, legal, journals, published, articles, about, an, outbreak, in, livestock, that, caused, gastrointestinal, anthrax, in, people, having, consumed, infected, meat, and, cutaneous, anthrax, in, people, having, come, into, contact, with, the, animals, all, medical, and, public, health, records, were, confiscated, by, the, kgb, in, addition, to, the, medical, problems, the, outbreak, caused, it, also, prompted, western, countries, to, be, more, suspicious, of, a, covert, soviet, bioweapons, program, and, to, increase, their, surveillance, of, suspected, sites, in, 1986, the, us, government, was, allowed, to, investigate, the, incident, and, concluded, the, exposure, was, from, aerosol, anthrax, from, a, military, weapons, facility, in, 1992, president, yeltsin, admitted, he, was, absolutely, certain, that, rumors, about, the, soviet, union, violating, the, 1972, bioweapons, treaty, were, true, the, soviet, union, like, the, us, and, uk, had, agreed, to, submit, information, to, the, un, about, their, bioweapons, programs, but, omitted, known, facilities, and, never, acknowledged, their, weapons, program, in, theory, anthrax, spores, can, be, cultivated, with, minimal, special, equipment, and, a, first, year, collegiate, microbiological, education, to, make, large, amounts, of, an, aerosol, form, of, anthrax, suitable, for, biological, warfare, requires, extensive, practical, knowledge, training, and, highly, advanced, equipment, concentrated, anthrax, spores, were, used, for, bioterrorism, in, the, 2001, anthrax, attacks, in, the, united, states, delivered, by, mailing, postal, letters, containing, the, spores, the, letters, were, sent, to, several, news, media, offices, and, two, democratic, senators, tom, daschle, of, south, dakota, and, patrick, leahy, of, vermont, as, a, result, 22, were, infected, and, five, died, only, a, few, grams, of, material, were, used, in, these, attacks, and, in, august, 2008, the, us, department, of, justice, announced, they, believed, that, bruce, ivins, a, senior, biodefense, researcher, employed, by, the, united, states, government, was, responsible, these, events, also, spawned, many, anthrax, hoaxes, due, to, these, events, the, us, postal, service, installed, biohazard, detection, systems, at, its, major, distribution, centers, to, actively, scan, for, anthrax, being, transported, through, the, mail, as, of, 2020, no, positive, alerts, by, these, systems, have, occurred, in, response, to, the, postal, anthrax, attacks, and, hoaxes, the, united, states, postal, service, sterilized, some, mail, using, gamma, irradiation, and, treatment, with, a, proprietary, enzyme, formula, supplied, by, sipco, industries, a, scientific, experiment, performed, by, a, high, school, student, later, published, in, the, journal, of, medical, toxicology, suggested, a, domestic, electric, iron, at, its, hottest, setting, at, least, 400, f, 204, c, used, for, at, least, 5, minutes, should, destroy, all, anthrax, spores, in, a, common, postal, envelope, anthrax, is, especially, rare, in, dogs, and, cats, as, is, evidenced, by, a, single, reported, case, in, the, united, states, in, 2001, anthrax, outbreaks, occur, in, some, wild, animal, populations, with, some, regularity, russian, researchers, estimate, arctic, permafrost, contains, around, 1, 5, million, anthrax, infected, reindeer, carcasses, and, the, spores, may, survive, in, the, permafrost, for, 105, years, a, risk, exists, that, global, warming, in, the, arctic, can, thaw, the, permafrost, releasing, anthrax, spores, in, the, carcasses, in, 2016, an, anthrax, outbreak, in, reindeer, was, linked, to, a, 75, year, old, carcass, that, defrosted, during, a, heat, wave
