cocaine, from, french, coca, ne, from, spanish, coca, ultimately, from, quechua, k, ka, is, a, tropane, alkaloid, that, acts, as, a, central, nervous, system, cns, stimulant, as, an, extract, it, is, mainly, used, recreationally, and, often, illegally, for, its, euphoric, and, rewarding, effects, it, is, also, used, in, medicine, by, indigenous, south, americans, for, various, purposes, and, rarely, but, more, formally, as, a, local, anaesthetic, or, diagnostic, tool, by, medical, practitioners, in, more, developed, countries, it, is, primarily, obtained, from, the, leaves, of, two, coca, species, native, to, south, america, erythroxylum, coca, and, e, novogranatense, after, extraction, from, the, plant, and, further, processing, into, cocaine, hydrochloride, powdered, cocaine, the, drug, is, administered, by, being, either, snorted, applied, topically, to, the, mouth, or, dissolved, and, injected, into, a, vein, it, can, also, then, be, turned, into, free, base, form, typically, crack, cocaine, in, which, it, can, be, heated, until, sublimated, and, then, the, vapours, can, be, inhaled, cocaine, stimulates, the, mesolimbic, pathway, in, the, brain, mental, effects, may, include, an, intense, feeling, of, happiness, sexual, arousal, loss, of, contact, with, reality, or, agitation, physical, effects, may, include, a, fast, heart, rate, sweating, and, dilated, pupils, high, doses, can, result, in, high, blood, pressure, or, high, body, temperature, onset, of, effects, can, begin, within, seconds, to, minutes, of, use, depending, on, method, of, delivery, and, can, last, between, five, and, ninety, minutes, as, cocaine, also, has, numbing, and, blood, vessel, constriction, properties, it, is, occasionally, used, during, surgery, on, the, throat, or, inside, of, the, nose, to, control, pain, bleeding, and, vocal, cord, spasm, cocaine, crosses, the, blood, brain, barrier, via, a, proton, coupled, organic, cation, antiporter, and, to, a, lesser, extent, via, passive, diffusion, across, cell, membranes, cocaine, blocks, the, dopamine, transporter, inhibiting, reuptake, of, dopamine, from, the, synaptic, cleft, into, the, pre, synaptic, axon, terminal, the, higher, dopamine, levels, in, the, synaptic, cleft, increase, dopamine, receptor, activation, in, the, post, synaptic, neuron, causing, euphoria, and, arousal, cocaine, also, blocks, the, serotonin, transporter, and, norepinephrine, transporter, inhibiting, reuptake, of, serotonin, and, norepinephrine, from, the, synaptic, cleft, into, the, pre, synaptic, axon, terminal, and, increasing, activation, of, serotonin, receptors, and, norepinephrine, receptors, in, the, post, synaptic, neuron, contributing, to, the, mental, and, physical, effects, of, cocaine, exposure, a, single, dose, of, cocaine, induces, tolerance, to, the, drug, s, effects, repeated, use, is, likely, to, result, in, addiction, addicts, who, abstain, from, cocaine, may, experience, prolonged, craving, lasting, for, many, months, abstaining, addicts, also, experience, modest, drug, withdrawal, symptoms, lasting, up, to, 24, hours, with, sleep, disruption, anxiety, irritability, crashing, depression, decreased, libido, decreased, ability, to, feel, pleasure, and, fatigue, being, common, use, of, cocaine, increases, the, overall, risk, of, death, and, intravenous, use, potentially, increases, the, risk, of, trauma, and, infectious, diseases, such, as, blood, infections, and, hiv, through, the, use, of, shared, paraphernalia, it, also, increases, risk, of, stroke, heart, attack, cardiac, arrhythmia, lung, injury, when, smoked, and, sudden, cardiac, death, illicitly, sold, cocaine, can, be, adulterated, with, fentanyl, local, anesthetics, levamisole, cornstarch, quinine, or, sugar, which, can, result, in, additional, toxicity, in, 2017, the, global, burden, of, disease, study, found, that, cocaine, use, caused, around, 7, 300, deaths, annually, coca, leaves, have, been, used, by, andean, civilizations, since, ancient, times, in, ancient, wari, culture, inca, culture, and, through, modern, successor, indigenous, cultures, of, the, andes, mountains, coca, leaves, are, chewed, taken, orally, in, the, form, of, a, tea, or, alternatively, prepared, in, a, sachet, wrapped, around, alkaline, burnt, ashes, and, held, in, the, mouth, against, the, inner, cheek, it, has, traditionally, been, used, to, combat, the, effects, of, cold, hunger, and, altitude, sickness, cocaine, was, first, isolated, from, the, leaves, in, 1860, globally, in, 2019, cocaine, was, used, by, an, estimated, 20, million, people, 0, 4, of, adults, aged, 15, to, 64, years, the, highest, prevalence, of, cocaine, use, was, in, australia, and, new, zealand, 2, 1, followed, by, north, america, 2, 1, western, and, central, europe, 1, 4, and, south, and, central, america, 1, 0, since, 1961, the, single, convention, on, narcotic, drugs, has, required, countries, to, make, recreational, use, of, cocaine, a, crime, in, the, united, states, cocaine, is, regulated, as, a, schedule, ii, drug, under, the, controlled, substances, act, meaning, that, it, has, a, high, potential, for, abuse, but, has, an, accepted, medical, use, while, rarely, used, medically, today, its, accepted, uses, are, as, a, topical, local, anesthetic, for, the, upper, respiratory, tract, as, well, as, to, reduce, bleeding, in, the, mouth, throat, and, nasal, cavities, cocaine, eye, drops, are, frequently, used, by, neurologists, when, examining, patients, suspected, of, having, horner, syndrome, in, horner, syndrome, sympathetic, innervation, to, the, eye, is, blocked, in, a, healthy, eye, cocaine, will, stimulate, the, sympathetic, nerves, by, inhibiting, norepinephrine, reuptake, and, the, pupil, will, dilate, if, the, patient, has, horner, syndrome, the, sympathetic, nerves, are, blocked, and, the, affected, eye, will, remain, constricted, or, dilate, to, a, lesser, extent, than, the, opposing, unaffected, eye, which, also, receives, the, eye, drop, test, if, both, eyes, dilate, equally, the, patient, does, not, have, horner, syndrome, topical, cocaine, is, sometimes, used, as, a, local, numbing, agent, and, vasoconstrictor, to, help, control, pain, and, bleeding, with, surgery, of, the, nose, mouth, throat, or, lacrimal, duct, although, some, absorption, and, systemic, effects, may, occur, the, use, of, cocaine, as, a, topical, anesthetic, and, vasoconstrictor, is, generally, safe, rarely, causing, cardiovascular, toxicity, glaucoma, and, pupil, dilation, occasionally, cocaine, is, mixed, with, adrenaline, and, sodium, bicarbonate, and, used, topically, for, surgery, a, formulation, called, moffett, s, solution, cocaine, hydrochloride, goprelto, an, ester, local, anesthetic, was, approved, for, medical, use, in, the, united, states, in, december, 2017, and, is, indicated, for, the, introduction, of, local, anesthesia, of, the, mucous, membranes, for, diagnostic, procedures, and, surgeries, on, or, through, the, nasal, cavities, of, adults, cocaine, hydrochloride, numbrino, was, approved, for, medical, use, in, the, united, states, in, january, 2020, the, most, common, adverse, reactions, in, people, treated, with, goprelto, are, headache, and, epistaxis, the, most, common, adverse, reactions, in, people, treated, with, numbrino, are, hypertension, tachycardia, and, sinus, tachycardia, cocaine, is, a, central, nervous, system, stimulant, its, effects, can, last, from, 15, minutes, to, an, hour, the, duration, of, cocaine, s, effects, depends, on, the, amount, taken, and, the, route, of, administration, cocaine, can, be, in, the, form, of, fine, white, powder, and, has, a, bitter, taste, crack, cocaine, is, a, smokeable, form, of, cocaine, made, into, small, rocks, by, processing, cocaine, with, sodium, bicarbonate, baking, soda, and, water, crack, cocaine, is, referred, to, as, crack, because, of, the, crackling, sounds, it, makes, when, heated, cocaine, use, leads, to, increases, in, alertness, feelings, of, well, being, and, euphoria, increased, energy, and, motor, activity, and, increased, feelings, of, competence, and, sexuality, analysis, of, the, correlation, between, the, use, of, 18, various, psychoactive, substances, shows, that, cocaine, use, correlates, with, other, party, drugs, such, as, ecstasy, or, amphetamines, as, well, as, with, heroin, and, benzodiazepines, use, and, can, be, considered, as, a, bridge, between, the, use, of, different, groups, of, drugs, it, is, legal, for, people, to, use, coca, leaves, in, some, andean, nations, such, as, peru, and, bolivia, where, they, are, chewed, consumed, in, the, form, of, tea, or, are, sometimes, incorporated, into, food, products, coca, leaves, are, typically, mixed, with, an, alkaline, substance, such, as, lime, and, chewed, into, a, wad, that, is, retained, in, the, buccal, pouch, mouth, between, gum, and, cheek, much, the, same, as, chewing, tobacco, is, chewed, and, sucked, of, its, juices, the, juices, are, absorbed, slowly, by, the, mucous, membrane, of, the, inner, cheek, and, by, the, gastrointestinal, tract, when, swallowed, alternatively, coca, leaves, can, be, infused, in, liquid, and, consumed, like, tea, coca, tea, an, infusion, of, coca, leaves, is, also, a, traditional, method, of, consumption, the, tea, has, often, been, recommended, for, travelers, in, the, andes, to, prevent, altitude, sickness, its, actual, effectiveness, has, never, been, systematically, studied, in, 1986, an, article, in, the, journal, of, the, american, medical, association, revealed, that, u, s, health, food, stores, were, selling, dried, coca, leaves, to, be, prepared, as, an, infusion, as, health, inca, tea, while, the, packaging, claimed, it, had, been, decocainized, no, such, process, had, actually, taken, place, the, article, stated, that, drinking, two, cups, of, the, tea, per, day, gave, a, mild, stimulation, increased, heart, rate, and, mood, elevation, and, the, tea, was, essentially, harmless, nasal, insufflation, known, colloquially, as, snorting, sniffing, or, blowing, is, a, common, method, of, ingestion, of, recreational, powdered, cocaine, the, drug, coats, and, is, absorbed, through, the, mucous, membranes, lining, the, nasal, passages, cocaine, s, desired, euphoric, effects, are, delayed, when, snorted, through, the, nose, by, about, five, minutes, this, occurs, because, cocaine, s, absorption, is, slowed, by, its, constricting, effect, on, the, blood, vessels, of, the, nose, insufflation, of, cocaine, also, leads, to, the, longest, duration, of, its, effects, 60, 90, minutes, when, insufflating, cocaine, absorption, through, the, nasal, membranes, is, approximately, 30, 60, in, a, study, of, cocaine, users, the, average, time, taken, to, reach, peak, subjective, effects, was, 14, 6, minutes, any, damage, to, the, inside, of, the, nose, is, due, to, cocaine, constricting, blood, vessels, and, therefore, restricting, blood, and, oxygen, nutrient, flow, to, that, area, rolled, up, banknotes, hollowed, out, pens, cut, straws, pointed, ends, of, keys, specialized, spoons, long, fingernails, and, clean, tampon, applicators, are, often, used, to, insufflate, cocaine, the, cocaine, typically, is, poured, onto, a, flat, hard, surface, such, as, a, mobile, phone, screen, mirror, cd, case, or, book, and, divided, into, bumps, lines, or, rails, and, then, insufflated, a, 2001, study, reported, that, the, sharing, of, straws, used, to, snort, cocaine, can, spread, blood, diseases, such, as, hepatitis, c, subjective, effects, not, commonly, shared, with, other, methods, of, administration, include, a, ringing, in, the, ears, moments, after, injection, usually, when, over, 120, milligrams, lasting, 2, to, 5, minutes, including, tinnitus, and, audio, distortion, this, is, colloquially, referred, to, as, a, bell, ringer, in, a, study, of, cocaine, users, the, average, time, taken, to, reach, peak, subjective, effects, was, 3, 1, minutes, the, euphoria, passes, quickly, aside, from, the, toxic, effects, of, cocaine, there, is, also, the, danger, of, circulatory, emboli, from, the, insoluble, substances, that, may, be, used, to, cut, the, drug, as, with, all, injected, illicit, substances, there, is, a, risk, of, the, user, contracting, blood, borne, infections, if, sterile, injecting, equipment, is, not, available, or, used, an, injected, mixture, of, cocaine, and, heroin, known, as, speedball, is, a, particularly, dangerous, combination, as, the, converse, effects, of, the, drugs, actually, complement, each, other, but, may, also, mask, the, symptoms, of, an, overdose, it, has, been, responsible, for, numerous, deaths, including, celebrities, such, as, comedians, actors, john, belushi, and, chris, farley, mitch, hedberg, river, phoenix, grunge, singer, layne, staley, and, actor, philip, seymour, hoffman, experimentally, cocaine, injections, can, be, delivered, to, animals, such, as, fruit, flies, to, study, the, mechanisms, of, cocaine, addiction, the, onset, of, cocaine, s, euphoric, effects, is, fastest, with, inhalation, beginning, after, 3, 5, seconds, this, gives, the, briefest, euphoria, 5, 15, minutes, cocaine, is, smoked, by, inhaling, the, vapor, produced, when, crack, cocaine, is, heated, to, the, point, of, sublimation, in, a, 2000, brookhaven, national, laboratory, medical, department, study, based, on, self, reports, of, 32, people, who, used, cocaine, who, participated, in, the, study, peak, high, was, found, at, a, mean, of, 1, 4, 0, 5, minutes, pyrolysis, products, of, cocaine, that, occur, only, when, heated, smoked, have, been, shown, to, change, the, effect, profile, i, e, anhydroecgonine, methyl, ester, when, co, administered, with, cocaine, increases, the, dopamine, in, cpu, and, nac, brain, regions, and, has, m, 1, and, m, 3, receptor, affinity, people, often, freebase, crack, with, a, pipe, made, from, a, small, glass, tube, often, taken, from, love, roses, small, glass, tubes, with, a, paper, rose, that, are, promoted, as, romantic, gifts, these, are, sometimes, called, stems, horns, blasters, and, straight, shooters, a, small, piece, of, clean, heavy, copper, or, occasionally, stainless, steel, scouring, pad, often, called, a, brillo, actual, brillo, pads, contain, soap, and, are, not, used, or, chore, named, for, chore, boy, brand, copper, scouring, pads, serves, as, a, reduction, base, and, flow, modulator, in, which, the, rock, can, be, melted, and, boiled, to, vapor, crack, is, smoked, by, placing, it, at, the, end, of, the, pipe, a, flame, held, close, to, it, produces, vapor, which, is, then, inhaled, by, the, smoker, the, effects, felt, almost, immediately, after, smoking, are, very, intense, and, do, not, last, long, usually, 2, to, 10, minutes, when, smoked, cocaine, is, sometimes, combined, with, other, drugs, such, as, cannabis, often, rolled, into, a, joint, or, blunt, acute, exposure, to, cocaine, has, many, effects, on, humans, including, euphoria, increases, in, heart, rate, and, blood, pressure, and, increases, in, cortisol, secretion, from, the, adrenal, gland, in, humans, with, acute, exposure, followed, by, continuous, exposure, to, cocaine, at, a, constant, blood, concentration, the, acute, tolerance, to, the, chronotropic, cardiac, effects, of, cocaine, begins, after, about, 10, minutes, while, acute, tolerance, to, the, euphoric, effects, of, cocaine, begins, after, about, one, hour, with, excessive, or, prolonged, use, the, drug, can, cause, itching, fast, heart, rate, and, paranoid, delusions, or, sensations, of, insects, crawling, on, the, skin, intranasal, cocaine, and, crack, use, are, both, associated, with, pharmacological, violence, aggressive, behavior, may, be, displayed, by, both, addicts, and, casual, users, cocaine, can, induce, psychosis, characterized, by, paranoia, impaired, reality, testing, hallucinations, irritability, and, physical, aggression, cocaine, intoxication, can, cause, hyperawareness, hypervigilance, and, psychomotor, agitation, and, delirium, consumption, of, large, doses, of, cocaine, can, cause, violent, outbursts, especially, by, those, with, preexisting, psychosis, crack, related, violence, is, also, systemic, relating, to, disputes, between, crack, dealers, and, users, acute, exposure, may, induce, cardiac, arrhythmias, including, atrial, fibrillation, supraventricular, tachycardia, ventricular, tachycardia, and, ventricular, fibrillation, acute, exposure, may, also, lead, to, angina, heart, attack, and, congestive, heart, failure, cocaine, overdose, may, cause, seizures, abnormally, high, body, temperature, and, a, marked, elevation, of, blood, pressure, which, can, be, life, threatening, abnormal, heart, rhythms, and, death, anxiety, paranoia, and, restlessness, can, also, occur, especially, during, the, comedown, with, excessive, dosage, tremors, convulsions, and, increased, body, temperature, are, observed, severe, cardiac, adverse, events, particularly, sudden, cardiac, death, become, a, serious, risk, at, high, doses, due, to, cocaine, s, blocking, effect, on, cardiac, sodium, channels, incidental, exposure, of, the, eye, to, sublimated, cocaine, while, smoking, crack, cocaine, can, cause, serious, injury, to, the, cornea, and, long, term, loss, of, visual, acuity, although, it, has, been, commonly, asserted, the, available, evidence, does, not, show, that, chronic, use, of, cocaine, is, associated, with, broad, cognitive, deficits, research, is, inconclusive, on, age, related, loss, of, striatal, dopamine, transporter, dat, sites, suggesting, cocaine, has, neuroprotective, or, neurodegenerative, properties, for, dopamine, neurons, exposure, to, cocaine, may, lead, to, the, breakdown, of, the, blood, brain, barrier, physical, side, effects, from, chronic, smoking, of, cocaine, include, coughing, up, blood, bronchospasm, itching, fever, diffuse, alveolar, infiltrates, without, effusions, pulmonary, and, systemic, eosinophilia, chest, pain, lung, trauma, sore, throat, asthma, hoarse, voice, dyspnea, shortness, of, breath, and, an, aching, flu, like, syndrome, cocaine, constricts, blood, vessels, dilates, pupils, and, increases, body, temperature, heart, rate, and, blood, pressure, it, can, also, cause, headaches, and, gastrointestinal, complications, such, as, abdominal, pain, and, nausea, a, common, but, untrue, belief, is, that, the, smoking, of, cocaine, chemically, breaks, down, tooth, enamel, and, causes, tooth, decay, cocaine, can, cause, involuntary, tooth, grinding, known, as, bruxism, which, can, deteriorate, tooth, enamel, and, lead, to, gingivitis, additionally, stimulants, like, cocaine, methamphetamine, and, even, caffeine, cause, dehydration, and, dry, mouth, since, saliva, is, an, important, mechanism, in, maintaining, one, s, oral, ph, level, people, who, use, cocaine, over, a, long, period, of, time, who, do, not, hydrate, sufficiently, may, experience, demineralization, of, their, teeth, due, to, the, ph, of, the, tooth, surface, dropping, too, low, below, 5, 5, cocaine, use, also, promotes, the, formation, of, blood, clots, this, increase, in, blood, clot, formation, is, attributed, to, cocaine, associated, increases, in, the, activity, of, plasminogen, activator, inhibitor, and, an, increase, in, the, number, activation, and, aggregation, of, platelets, chronic, intranasal, usage, can, degrade, the, cartilage, separating, the, nostrils, the, septum, nasi, leading, eventually, to, its, complete, disappearance, due, to, the, absorption, of, the, cocaine, from, cocaine, hydrochloride, the, remaining, hydrochloride, forms, a, dilute, hydrochloric, acid, illicitly, sold, cocaine, may, be, contaminated, with, levamisole, levamisole, may, accentuate, cocaine, s, effects, levamisole, adulterated, cocaine, has, been, associated, with, autoimmune, disease, cocaine, use, leads, to, an, increased, risk, of, hemorrhagic, and, ischemic, strokes, cocaine, use, also, increases, the, risk, of, having, a, heart, attack, relatives, of, persons, with, cocaine, addiction, have, an, increased, risk, of, cocaine, addiction, cocaine, addiction, occurs, through, fosb, overexpression, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, which, results, in, altered, transcriptional, regulation, in, neurons, within, the, nucleus, accumbens, fosb, levels, have, been, found, to, increase, upon, the, use, of, cocaine, each, subsequent, dose, of, cocaine, continues, to, increase, fosb, levels, with, no, ceiling, of, tolerance, elevated, levels, of, fosb, leads, to, increases, in, brain, derived, neurotrophic, factor, bdnf, levels, which, in, turn, increases, the, number, of, dendritic, branches, and, spines, present, on, neurons, involved, with, the, nucleus, accumbens, and, prefrontal, cortex, areas, of, the, brain, this, change, can, be, identified, rather, quickly, and, may, be, sustained, weeks, after, the, last, dose, of, the, drug, transgenic, mice, exhibiting, inducible, expression, of, fosb, primarily, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, and, dorsal, striatum, exhibit, sensitized, behavioural, responses, to, cocaine, they, self, administer, cocaine, at, lower, doses, than, control, but, have, a, greater, likelihood, of, relapse, when, the, drug, is, withheld, fosb, increases, the, expression, of, ampa, receptor, subunit, glur2, and, also, decreases, expression, of, dynorphin, thereby, enhancing, sensitivity, to, reward, dna, damage, is, increased, in, the, brain, of, rodents, by, administration, of, cocaine, during, dna, repair, of, such, damages, persistent, chromatin, alterations, may, occur, such, as, methylation, of, dna, or, the, acetylation, or, methylation, of, histones, at, the, sites, of, repair, these, alterations, can, be, epigenetic, scars, in, the, chromatin, that, contribute, to, the, persistent, epigenetic, changes, found, in, cocaine, addiction, in, humans, cocaine, abuse, may, cause, structural, changes, in, brain, connectivity, though, it, is, unclear, to, what, extent, these, changes, are, permanent, cocaine, dependence, develops, after, even, brief, periods, of, regular, cocaine, use, and, produces, a, withdrawal, state, with, emotional, motivational, deficits, upon, cessation, of, cocaine, use, crack, baby, is, a, term, for, a, child, born, to, a, mother, who, used, crack, cocaine, during, her, pregnancy, the, threat, that, cocaine, use, during, pregnancy, poses, to, the, fetus, is, now, considered, exaggerated, studies, show, that, prenatal, cocaine, exposure, independent, of, other, effects, such, as, for, example, alcohol, tobacco, or, physical, environment, has, no, appreciable, effect, on, childhood, growth, and, development, in, 2007, he, national, institute, on, drug, abuse, of, the, united, states, warned, about, health, risks, while, cautioning, against, stereotyping, many, recall, that, crack, babies, or, babies, born, to, mothers, who, used, crack, cocaine, while, pregnant, were, at, one, time, written, off, by, many, as, a, lost, generation, they, were, predicted, to, suffer, from, severe, irreversible, damage, including, reduced, intelligence, and, social, skills, it, was, later, found, that, this, was, a, gross, exaggeration, however, the, fact, that, most, of, these, children, appear, normal, should, not, be, over, interpreted, as, indicating, that, there, is, no, cause, for, concern, using, sophisticated, technologies, scientists, are, now, finding, that, exposure, to, cocaine, during, fetal, development, may, lead, to, subtle, yet, significant, later, deficits, in, some, children, including, deficits, in, some, aspects, of, cognitive, performance, information, processing, and, attention, to, tasks, abilities, that, are, important, for, success, in, school, there, are, also, warnings, about, the, threat, of, breastfeeding, the, march, of, dimes, said, it, is, likely, that, cocaine, will, reach, the, baby, through, breast, milk, and, advises, the, following, regarding, cocaine, use, during, pregnancy, cocaine, use, during, pregnancy, can, affect, a, pregnant, woman, and, her, unborn, baby, in, many, ways, during, the, early, months, of, pregnancy, it, may, increase, the, risk, of, miscarriage, later, in, pregnancy, it, can, trigger, preterm, labor, labor, that, occurs, before, 37, weeks, of, pregnancy, or, cause, the, baby, to, grow, poorly, as, a, result, cocaine, exposed, babies, are, more, likely, than, unexposed, babies, to, be, born, with, low, birth, weight, less, than, 5, 5, lb, or, 2, 5, kg, low, birthweight, babies, are, 20, times, more, likely, to, die, in, their, first, month, of, life, than, normal, weight, babies, and, face, an, increased, risk, of, lifelong, disabilities, such, as, mental, retardation, and, cerebral, palsy, cocaine, exposed, babies, also, tend, to, have, smaller, heads, which, generally, reflect, smaller, brains, some, studies, suggest, that, cocaine, exposed, babies, are, at, increased, risk, of, birth, defects, including, urinary, tract, defects, and, possibly, heart, defects, cocaine, also, may, cause, an, unborn, baby, to, have, a, stroke, irreversible, brain, damage, or, a, heart, attack, persons, with, regular, or, problematic, use, of, cocaine, have, a, significantly, higher, rate, of, death, and, are, specifically, at, higher, risk, of, traumatic, deaths, and, deaths, attributable, to, infectious, disease, the, extent, of, absorption, of, cocaine, into, the, systemic, circulation, after, nasal, insufflation, is, similar, to, that, after, oral, ingestion, the, rate, of, absorption, after, nasal, insufflation, is, limited, by, cocaine, induced, vasoconstriction, of, capillaries, in, the, nasal, mucosa, onset, of, absorption, after, oral, ingestion, is, delayed, because, cocaine, is, a, weak, base, with, a, pka, of, 8, 6, and, is, thus, in, an, ionized, form, that, is, poorly, absorbed, from, the, acidic, stomach, and, easily, absorbed, from, the, alkaline, duodenum, the, rate, and, extent, of, absorption, from, inhalation, of, cocaine, is, similar, or, greater, than, with, intravenous, injection, as, inhalation, provides, access, directly, to, the, pulmonary, capillary, bed, the, delay, in, absorption, after, oral, ingestion, may, account, for, the, popular, belief, that, cocaine, bioavailability, from, the, stomach, is, lower, than, after, insufflation, compared, with, ingestion, the, faster, absorption, of, insufflated, cocaine, results, in, quicker, attainment, of, maximum, drug, effects, snorting, cocaine, produces, maximum, physiological, effects, within, 40, minutes, and, maximum, psychotropic, effects, within, 20, minutes, physiological, and, psychotropic, effects, from, nasally, insufflated, cocaine, are, sustained, for, approximately, 40, 60, minutes, after, the, peak, effects, are, attained, cocaine, crosses, the, blood, brain, barrier, via, both, a, proton, coupled, organic, cation, antiporter, and, to, a, lesser, extent, via, passive, diffusion, across, cell, membranes, as, of, september, 2022, the, gene, or, genes, encoding, the, human, proton, organic, cation, antiporter, had, not, been, identified, cocaine, has, a, short, elimination, half, life, of, 0, 7, 1, 5, hours, and, is, extensively, metabolized, by, plasma, esterases, and, also, by, liver, cholinesterases, with, only, about, 1, excreted, unchanged, in, the, urine, the, metabolism, is, dominated, by, hydrolytic, ester, cleavage, so, the, eliminated, metabolites, consist, mostly, of, benzoylecgonine, be, the, major, metabolite, and, other, metabolites, in, lesser, amounts, such, as, ecgonine, methyl, ester, eme, and, ecgonine, further, minor, metabolites, of, cocaine, include, norcocaine, p, hydroxycocaine, m, hydroxycocaine, p, hydroxybenzoylecgonine, pohbe, and, m, hydroxybenzoylecgonine, if, consumed, with, alcohol, cocaine, combines, with, alcohol, in, the, liver, to, form, cocaethylene, studies, have, suggested, cocaethylene, is, more, euphoric, and, has, a, higher, cardiovascular, toxicity, than, cocaine, by, itself, depending, on, liver, and, kidney, functions, cocaine, metabolites, are, detectable, in, urine, between, three, and, eight, days, generally, speaking, benzoylecgonine, is, eliminated, from, someone, s, urine, between, three, and, five, days, in, urine, from, heavy, cocaine, users, benzoylecgonine, can, be, detected, within, four, hours, after, intake, and, in, concentrations, greater, than, 150, ng, ml, for, up, to, eight, days, later, detection, of, cocaine, metabolites, in, hair, is, possible, in, regular, users, until, after, the, sections, of, hair, grown, during, the, period, of, cocaine, use, are, cut, or, fall, out, the, pharmacodynamics, of, cocaine, involve, the, complex, relationships, of, neurotransmitters, inhibiting, monoamine, uptake, in, rats, with, ratios, of, about, serotonin, dopamine, 2, 3, serotonin, norepinephrine, 2, 5, the, most, extensively, studied, effect, of, cocaine, on, the, central, nervous, system, is, the, blockade, of, the, dopamine, transporter, protein, dopamine, neurotransmitter, released, during, neural, signaling, is, normally, recycled, via, the, transporter, i, e, the, transporter, binds, the, transmitter, and, pumps, it, out, of, the, synaptic, cleft, back, into, the, presynaptic, neuron, where, it, is, taken, up, into, storage, vesicles, cocaine, binds, tightly, at, the, dopamine, transporter, forming, a, complex, that, blocks, the, transporter, s, function, the, dopamine, transporter, can, no, longer, perform, its, reuptake, function, and, thus, dopamine, accumulates, in, the, synaptic, cleft, the, increased, concentration, of, dopamine, in, the, synapse, activates, post, synaptic, dopamine, receptors, which, makes, the, drug, rewarding, and, promotes, the, compulsive, use, of, cocaine, cocaine, affects, certain, serotonin, 5, ht, receptors, in, particular, it, has, been, shown, to, antagonize, the, 5, ht, 3, receptor, which, is, a, ligand, gated, ion, channel, an, overabundance, of, 5, ht, 3, receptors, is, reported, in, cocaine, conditioned, rats, though, 5, ht, 3, s, role, is, unclear, the, 5, ht, 2, receptor, particularly, the, subtypes, 5, ht, 2a, 5, ht, 2b, and, 5, ht, 2c, are, involved, in, the, locomotor, activating, effects, of, cocaine, cocaine, has, been, demonstrated, to, bind, as, to, directly, stabilize, the, dat, transporter, on, the, open, outward, facing, conformation, further, cocaine, binds, in, such, a, way, as, to, inhibit, a, hydrogen, bond, innate, to, dat, cocaine, s, binding, properties, are, such, that, it, attaches, so, this, hydrogen, bond, will, not, form, and, is, blocked, from, formation, due, to, the, tightly, locked, orientation, of, the, cocaine, molecule, research, studies, have, suggested, that, the, affinity, for, the, transporter, is, not, what, is, involved, in, the, habituation, of, the, substance, so, much, as, the, conformation, and, binding, properties, to, where, and, how, on, the, transporter, the, molecule, binds, conflicting, findings, have, challenged, the, widely, accepted, view, that, cocaine, functions, solely, as, a, reuptake, inhibitor, to, induce, euphoria, an, intravenous, dose, of, 0, 3, 0, 6, mg, kg, of, cocaine, is, required, which, blocks, 66, 70, of, dopamine, transporters, dat, in, the, brain, re, administering, cocaine, beyond, this, threshold, does, not, significantly, increase, dat, occupancy, but, still, results, in, an, increase, of, euphoria, which, cannot, be, explained, by, reuptake, inhibition, alone, this, discrepancy, is, not, shared, with, other, dopamine, reuptake, inhbitors, like, bupropion, sibutramine, mazindol, or, tesofensine, which, have, similar, or, higher, potencies, than, cocaine, as, dopamine, reuptake, inhibitors, these, findings, have, evoked, a, hypothesis, that, cocaine, may, also, function, as, a, so, called, dat, inverse, agonist, or, negative, allosteric, modifier, of, dat, resulting, in, dopamine, transporter, reversal, and, subsequent, dopamine, release, into, the, synaptic, cleft, from, the, axon, terminal, in, a, manner, similar, to, but, distinct, from, amphetamines, sigma, receptors, are, affected, by, cocaine, as, cocaine, functions, as, a, sigma, ligand, agonist, further, specific, receptors, it, has, been, demonstrated, to, function, on, are, nmda, and, the, d, 1, dopamine, receptor, cocaine, also, blocks, sodium, channels, thereby, interfering, with, the, propagation, of, action, potentials, thus, like, lignocaine, and, novocaine, it, acts, as, a, local, anesthetic, it, also, functions, on, the, binding, sites, to, the, dopamine, and, serotonin, sodium, dependent, transport, area, as, targets, as, separate, mechanisms, from, its, reuptake, of, those, transporters, unique, to, its, local, anesthetic, value, which, makes, it, in, a, class, of, functionality, different, from, both, its, own, derived, phenyltropanes, analogues, which, have, that, removed, in, addition, to, this, cocaine, has, some, target, binding, to, the, site, of, the, opioid, receptor, cocaine, also, causes, vasoconstriction, thus, reducing, bleeding, during, minor, surgical, procedures, recent, research, points, to, an, important, role, of, circadian, mechanisms, and, clock, genes, in, behavioral, actions, of, cocaine, cocaine, is, known, to, suppress, hunger, and, appetite, by, increasing, co, localization, of, sigma, 1, r, receptors, and, ghrelin, ghs, r1a, receptors, at, the, neuronal, cell, surface, thereby, increasing, ghrelin, mediated, signaling, of, satiety, and, possibly, via, other, effects, on, appetitive, hormones, chronic, users, may, lose, their, appetite, and, can, experience, severe, malnutrition, and, significant, weight, loss, cocaine, effects, further, are, shown, to, be, potentiated, for, the, user, when, used, in, conjunction, with, new, surroundings, and, stimuli, and, otherwise, novel, environs, cocaine, in, its, purest, form, is, a, white, pearly, product, cocaine, appearing, in, powder, form, is, a, salt, typically, cocaine, hydrochloride, street, cocaine, is, often, adulterated, or, cut, with, talc, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, inositol, caffeine, procaine, phencyclidine, phenytoin, lignocaine, strychnine, levamisole, amphetamine, or, heroin, crack, cocaine, looks, like, irregular, shaped, white, rocks, cocaine, a, tropane, alkaloid, is, a, weakly, alkaline, compound, and, can, therefore, combine, with, acidic, compounds, to, form, salts, the, hydrochloride, hcl, salt, of, cocaine, is, by, far, the, most, commonly, encountered, although, the, sulfate, so, 4, 2, and, the, nitrate, no, 3, salts, are, occasionally, seen, different, salts, dissolve, to, a, greater, or, lesser, extent, in, various, solvents, the, hydrochloride, salt, is, polar, in, character, and, is, quite, soluble, in, water, as, the, name, implies, freebase, is, the, base, form, of, cocaine, as, opposed, to, the, salt, form, it, is, practically, insoluble, in, water, whereas, hydrochloride, salt, is, water, soluble, smoking, freebase, cocaine, has, the, additional, effect, of, releasing, methylecgonidine, into, the, user, s, system, due, to, the, pyrolysis, of, the, substance, a, side, effect, which, insufflating, or, injecting, powder, cocaine, does, not, create, some, research, suggests, that, smoking, freebase, cocaine, can, be, even, more, cardiotoxic, than, other, routes, of, administration, because, of, methylecgonidine, s, effects, on, lung, tissue, and, liver, tissue, pure, cocaine, is, prepared, by, neutralizing, its, compounding, salt, with, an, alkaline, solution, which, will, precipitate, non, polar, basic, cocaine, it, is, further, refined, through, aqueous, solvent, liquid, liquid, extraction, crack, is, usually, smoked, in, a, glass, pipe, and, once, inhaled, it, passes, from, the, lungs, directly, to, the, central, nervous, system, producing, an, almost, immediate, high, that, can, be, very, powerful, this, initial, crescendo, of, stimulation, is, known, as, a, rush, this, is, followed, by, an, equally, intense, low, leaving, the, user, craving, more, of, the, drug, addiction, to, crack, usually, occurs, within, four, to, six, weeks, much, more, rapidly, than, regular, cocaine, powder, cocaine, cocaine, hydrochloride, must, be, heated, to, a, high, temperature, about, 197, c, and, considerable, decomposition, burning, occurs, at, these, high, temperatures, this, effectively, destroys, some, of, the, cocaine, and, yields, a, sharp, acrid, and, foul, tasting, smoke, cocaine, base, crack, can, be, smoked, because, it, vaporizes, with, little, or, no, decomposition, at, 98, c, 208, f, which, is, below, the, boiling, point, of, water, crack, is, a, lower, purity, form, of, free, base, cocaine, that, is, usually, produced, by, neutralization, of, cocaine, hydrochloride, with, a, solution, of, baking, soda, sodium, bicarbonate, nahco, 3, and, water, producing, a, very, hard, brittle, off, white, to, brown, colored, amorphous, material, that, contains, sodium, carbonate, entrapped, water, and, other, by, products, as, the, main, impurities, the, origin, of, the, name, crack, comes, from, the, crackling, sound, and, hence, the, onomatopoeic, moniker, crack, that, is, produced, when, the, cocaine, and, its, impurities, i, e, water, sodium, bicarbonate, are, heated, past, the, point, of, vaporization, coca, herbal, infusion, also, referred, to, as, coca, tea, is, used, in, coca, leaf, producing, countries, much, as, any, herbal, medicinal, infusion, would, elsewhere, in, the, world, the, free, and, legal, commercialization, of, dried, coca, leaves, under, the, form, of, filtration, bags, to, be, used, as, coca, tea, has, been, actively, promoted, by, the, governments, of, peru, and, bolivia, for, many, years, as, a, drink, having, medicinal, powers, in, peru, the, national, coca, company, a, state, run, corporation, sells, cocaine, infused, teas, and, other, medicinal, products, and, also, exports, leaves, to, the, u, s, for, medicinal, use, visitors, to, the, city, of, cuzco, in, peru, and, la, paz, in, bolivia, are, greeted, with, the, offering, of, coca, leaf, infusions, prepared, in, teapots, with, whole, coca, leaves, purportedly, to, help, the, newly, arrived, traveler, overcome, the, malaise, of, high, altitude, sickness, the, effects, of, drinking, coca, tea, are, mild, stimulation, and, mood, lift, it, has, also, been, promoted, as, an, adjuvant, for, the, treatment, of, cocaine, dependence, one, study, on, coca, leaf, infusion, used, with, counseling, in, the, treatment, of, 23, addicted, coca, paste, smokers, in, lima, peru, found, that, the, relapses, rate, fell, from, 4, 35, times, per, month, on, average, before, coca, tea, treatment, to, one, during, treatment, the, duration, of, abstinence, increased, from, an, average, of, 32, days, before, treatment, to, 217, 2, days, during, treatment, this, suggests, that, coca, leaf, infusion, plus, counseling, may, be, effective, at, preventing, relapse, during, cocaine, addiction, treatment, there, is, little, information, on, the, pharmacological, and, toxicological, effects, of, consuming, coca, tea, a, chemical, analysis, by, solid, phase, extraction, and, gas, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, spe, gc, ms, of, peruvian, and, bolivian, tea, bags, indicated, the, presence, of, significant, amounts, of, cocaine, the, metabolite, benzoylecgonine, ecgonine, methyl, ester, and, trans, cinnamoylcocaine, in, coca, tea, bags, and, coca, tea, urine, specimens, were, also, analyzed, from, an, individual, who, consumed, one, cup, of, coca, tea, and, it, was, determined, that, enough, cocaine, and, cocaine, related, metabolites, were, present, to, produce, a, positive, drug, test, the, first, synthesis, and, elucidation, of, the, cocaine, molecule, was, by, richard, willst, tter, in, 1898, willst, tter, s, synthesis, derived, cocaine, from, tropinone, since, then, robert, robinson, and, edward, leete, have, made, significant, contributions, to, the, mechanism, of, the, synthesis, no, 3, the, additional, carbon, atoms, required, for, the, synthesis, of, cocaine, are, derived, from, acetyl, coa, by, addition, of, two, acetyl, coa, units, to, the, n, methyl, 1, pyrrolinium, cation, the, first, addition, is, a, mannich, like, reaction, with, the, enolate, anion, from, acetyl, coa, acting, as, a, nucleophile, toward, the, pyrrolinium, cation, the, second, addition, occurs, through, a, claisen, condensation, this, produces, a, racemic, mixture, of, the, 2, substituted, pyrrolidine, with, the, retention, of, the, thioester, from, the, claisen, condensation, in, formation, of, tropinone, from, racemic, ethyl, 4, nmethyl, 2, pyrrolidinyl, 3, oxobutanoate, there, is, no, preference, for, either, stereoisomer, in, cocaine, biosynthesis, only, the, s, enantiomer, can, cyclize, to, form, the, tropane, ring, system, of, cocaine, the, stereoselectivity, of, this, reaction, was, further, investigated, through, study, of, prochiral, methylene, hydrogen, discrimination, this, is, due, to, the, extra, chiral, center, at, c, 2, this, process, occurs, through, an, oxidation, which, regenerates, the, pyrrolinium, cation, and, formation, of, an, enolate, anion, and, an, intramolecular, mannich, reaction, the, tropane, ring, system, undergoes, hydrolysis, sam, dependent, methylation, and, reduction, via, nadph, for, the, formation, of, methylecgonine, the, benzoyl, moiety, required, for, the, formation, of, the, cocaine, diester, is, synthesized, from, phenylalanine, via, cinnamic, acid, benzoyl, coa, then, combines, the, two, units, to, form, cocaine, the, biosynthesis, begins, with, l, glutamine, which, is, derived, to, l, ornithine, in, plants, the, major, contribution, of, l, ornithine, and, l, arginine, as, a, precursor, to, the, tropane, ring, was, confirmed, by, edward, leete, ornithine, then, undergoes, a, pyridoxal, phosphate, dependent, decarboxylation, to, form, putrescine, in, some, animals, the, urea, cycle, derives, putrescine, from, ornithine, l, ornithine, is, converted, to, l, arginine, which, is, then, decarboxylated, via, plp, to, form, agmatine, hydrolysis, of, the, imine, derives, n, carbamoylputrescine, followed, with, hydrolysis, of, the, urea, to, form, putrescine, the, separate, pathways, of, converting, ornithine, to, putrescine, in, plants, and, animals, have, converged, a, sam, dependent, n, methylation, of, putrescine, gives, the, n, methylputrescine, product, which, then, undergoes, oxidative, deamination, by, the, action, of, diamine, oxidase, to, yield, the, aminoaldehyde, schiff, base, formation, confirms, the, biosynthesis, of, the, n, methyl, 1, pyrrolinium, cation, the, biosynthesis, of, the, tropane, alkaloid, is, still, not, understood, hemscheidt, proposes, that, robinson, s, acetonedicarboxylate, emerges, as, a, potential, intermediate, for, this, reaction, condensation, of, n, methylpyrrolinium, and, acetonedicarboxylate, would, generate, the, oxobutyrate, decarboxylation, leads, to, tropane, alkaloid, formation, the, reduction, of, tropinone, is, mediated, by, nadph, dependent, reductase, enzymes, which, have, been, characterized, in, multiple, plant, species, these, plant, species, all, contain, two, types, of, the, reductase, enzymes, tropinone, reductase, i, and, tropinone, reductase, ii, tri, produces, tropine, and, trii, produces, pseudotropine, due, to, differing, kinetic, and, ph, activity, characteristics, of, the, enzymes, and, by, the, 25, fold, higher, activity, of, tri, over, trii, the, majority, of, the, tropinone, reduction, is, from, tri, to, form, tropine, in, 2022, a, gmo, produced, n, benthamiana, were, discovered, that, were, able, to, produce, 25, of, the, amount, of, cocaine, found, in, a, coca, plant, cocaine, and, its, major, metabolites, may, be, quantified, in, blood, plasma, or, urine, to, monitor, for, use, confirm, a, diagnosis, of, poisoning, or, assist, in, the, forensic, investigation, of, a, traffic, or, other, criminal, violation, or, sudden, death, most, commercial, cocaine, immunoassay, screening, tests, cross, react, appreciably, with, the, major, cocaine, metabolites, but, chromatographic, techniques, can, easily, distinguish, and, separately, measure, each, of, these, substances, when, interpreting, the, results, of, a, test, it, is, important, to, consider, the, cocaine, usage, history, of, the, individual, since, a, chronic, user, can, develop, tolerance, to, doses, that, would, incapacitate, a, cocaine, naive, individual, and, the, chronic, user, often, has, high, baseline, values, of, the, metabolites, in, his, system, cautious, interpretation, of, testing, results, may, allow, a, distinction, between, passive, or, active, usage, and, between, smoking, versus, other, routes, of, administration, cocaine, may, be, detected, by, law, enforcement, using, the, scott, reagent, the, test, can, easily, generate, false, positives, for, common, substances, and, must, be, confirmed, with, a, laboratory, test, approximate, cocaine, purity, can, be, determined, using, 1, ml, 2, cupric, sulfate, pentahydrate, in, dilute, hcl, 1, ml, 2, potassium, thiocyanate, and, 2, ml, of, chloroform, the, shade, of, brown, shown, by, the, chloroform, is, proportional, to, the, cocaine, content, this, test, is, not, cross, sensitive, to, heroin, methamphetamine, benzocaine, procaine, and, a, number, of, other, drugs, but, other, chemicals, could, cause, false, positives, according, to, a, 2016, united, nations, report, england, and, wales, are, the, countries, with, the, highest, rate, of, cocaine, usage, 2, 4, of, adults, in, the, previous, year, other, countries, where, the, usage, rate, meets, or, exceeds, 1, 5, are, spain, and, scotland, 2, 2, the, united, states, 2, 1, australia, 2, 1, uruguay, 1, 8, brazil, 1, 75, chile, 1, 73, the, netherlands, 1, 5, and, ireland, 1, 5, cocaine, is, the, second, most, popular, illegal, recreational, drug, in, europe, behind, cannabis, since, the, mid, 1990s, overall, cocaine, usage, in, europe, has, been, on, the, rise, but, usage, rates, and, attitudes, tend, to, vary, between, countries, european, countries, with, the, highest, usage, rates, are, the, united, kingdom, spain, italy, and, the, republic, of, ireland, approximately, 17, million, europeans, 5, 1, have, used, cocaine, at, least, once, and, 3, 5, million, 1, 1, in, the, last, year, about, 1, 9, 2, 3, million, of, young, adults, 15, 34, years, old, have, used, cocaine, in, the, last, year, latest, data, available, as, of, 2018, usage, is, particularly, prevalent, among, this, demographic, 4, to, 7, of, males, have, used, cocaine, in, the, last, year, in, spain, denmark, the, republic, of, ireland, italy, and, the, united, kingdom, the, ratio, of, male, to, female, users, is, approximately, 3, 8, 1, but, this, statistic, varies, from, 1, 1, to, 13, 1, depending, on, country, in, 2014, london, had, the, highest, amount, of, cocaine, in, its, sewage, out, of, 50, european, cities, cocaine, is, the, second, most, popular, illegal, recreational, drug, in, the, united, states, behind, cannabis, and, the, u, s, is, the, world, s, largest, consumer, of, cocaine, its, users, span, over, different, ages, races, and, professions, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, the, drug, became, particularly, popular, in, the, disco, culture, as, cocaine, usage, was, very, common, and, popular, in, many, discos, such, as, studio, 54, indigenous, peoples, of, south, america, have, chewed, the, leaves, of, erythroxylon, coca, a, plant, that, contains, vital, nutrients, as, well, as, numerous, alkaloids, including, cocaine, for, over, a, thousand, years, the, coca, leaf, was, and, still, is, chewed, almost, universally, by, some, indigenous, communities, the, remains, of, coca, leaves, have, been, found, with, ancient, peruvian, mummies, and, pottery, from, the, time, period, depicts, humans, with, bulged, cheeks, indicating, the, presence, of, something, on, which, they, are, chewing, there, is, also, evidence, that, these, cultures, used, a, mixture, of, coca, leaves, and, saliva, as, an, anesthetic, for, the, performance, of, trepanation, when, the, spanish, arrived, in, south, america, the, conquistadors, at, first, banned, coca, as, an, evil, agent, of, devil, but, after, discovering, that, without, the, coca, the, locals, were, barely, able, to, work, the, conquistadors, legalized, and, taxed, the, leaf, taking, 10, off, the, value, of, each, crop, in, 1569, spanish, botanist, nicol, s, monardes, described, the, indigenous, peoples, practice, of, chewing, a, mixture, of, tobacco, and, coca, leaves, to, induce, great, contentment, when, they, wished, to, make, themselves, drunk, and, out, of, judgment, they, chewed, a, mixture, of, tobacco, and, coca, leaves, which, make, them, go, as, they, were, out, of, their, wittes, in, 1609, padre, blas, valera, wrote, coca, protects, the, body, from, many, ailments, and, our, doctors, use, it, in, powdered, form, to, reduce, the, swelling, of, wounds, to, strengthen, broken, bones, to, expel, cold, from, the, body, or, prevent, it, from, entering, and, to, cure, rotten, wounds, or, sores, that, are, full, of, maggots, and, if, it, does, so, much, for, outward, ailments, will, not, its, singular, virtue, have, even, greater, effect, in, the, entrails, of, those, who, eat, it, although, the, stimulant, and, hunger, suppressant, properties, of, coca, had, been, known, for, many, centuries, the, isolation, of, the, cocaine, alkaloid, was, not, achieved, until, 1855, various, european, scientists, had, attempted, to, isolate, cocaine, but, none, had, been, successful, for, two, reasons, the, knowledge, of, chemistry, required, was, insufficient, at, the, time, and, contemporary, conditions, of, sea, shipping, from, south, america, would, often, degrade, the, quality, of, the, cocaine, in, the, plant, samples, available, to, european, chemists, by, the, time, they, arrived, however, by, 1855, the, german, chemist, friedrich, gaedcke, successfully, isolated, the, cocaine, alkaloid, for, the, first, time, gaedcke, named, the, alkaloid, erythroxyline, and, published, a, description, in, the, journal, archiv, der, pharmazie, in, 1856, friedrich, w, hler, asked, dr, carl, scherzer, a, scientist, aboard, the, novara, an, austrian, frigate, sent, by, emperor, franz, joseph, to, circle, the, globe, to, bring, him, a, large, amount, of, coca, leaves, from, south, america, in, 1859, the, ship, finished, its, travels, and, w, hler, received, a, trunk, full, of, coca, w, hler, passed, on, the, leaves, to, albert, niemann, a, phd, student, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, in, germany, who, then, developed, an, improved, purification, process, niemann, described, every, step, he, took, to, isolate, cocaine, in, his, dissertation, titled, ber, eine, neue, organische, base, in, den, cocabl, ttern, on, a, new, organic, base, in, the, coca, leaves, which, was, published, in, 1860, and, earned, him, his, ph, d, he, wrote, of, the, alkaloid, s, colourless, transparent, prisms, and, said, that, its, solutions, have, an, alkaline, reaction, a, bitter, taste, promote, the, flow, of, saliva, and, leave, a, peculiar, numbness, followed, by, a, sense, of, cold, when, applied, to, the, tongue, niemann, named, the, alkaloid, cocaine, from, coca, from, quechua, k, ka, suffix, ine, the, first, synthesis, and, elucidation, of, the, structure, of, the, cocaine, molecule, was, by, richard, willst, tter, in, 1898, it, was, the, first, biomimetic, synthesis, of, an, organic, structure, recorded, in, academic, chemical, literature, the, synthesis, started, from, tropinone, a, related, natural, product, and, took, five, steps, because, of, the, former, use, of, cocaine, as, a, local, anesthetic, a, suffix, caine, was, later, extracted, and, used, to, form, names, of, synthetic, local, anesthetics, with, the, discovery, of, this, new, alkaloid, western, medicine, was, quick, to, exploit, the, possible, uses, of, this, plant, in, 1879, vassili, von, anrep, of, the, university, of, w, rzburg, devised, an, experiment, to, demonstrate, the, analgesic, properties, of, the, newly, discovered, alkaloid, he, prepared, two, separate, jars, one, containing, a, cocaine, salt, solution, with, the, other, containing, merely, saltwater, he, then, submerged, a, frog, s, legs, into, the, two, jars, one, leg, in, the, treatment, and, one, in, the, control, solution, and, proceeded, to, stimulate, the, legs, in, several, different, ways, the, leg, that, had, been, immersed, in, the, cocaine, solution, reacted, very, differently, from, the, leg, that, had, been, immersed, in, saltwater, karl, koller, a, close, associate, of, sigmund, freud, who, would, write, about, cocaine, later, experimented, with, cocaine, for, ophthalmic, usage, in, an, infamous, experiment, in, 1884, he, experimented, upon, himself, by, applying, a, cocaine, solution, to, his, own, eye, and, then, pricking, it, with, pins, his, findings, were, presented, to, the, heidelberg, ophthalmological, society, also, in, 1884, jellinek, demonstrated, the, effects, of, cocaine, as, a, respiratory, system, anesthetic, in, 1885, william, halsted, demonstrated, nerve, block, anesthesia, and, james, leonard, corning, demonstrated, peridural, anesthesia, 1898, saw, heinrich, quincke, use, cocaine, for, spinal, anesthesia, in, 1859, an, italian, doctor, paolo, mantegazza, returned, from, peru, where, he, had, witnessed, first, hand, the, use, of, coca, by, the, local, indigenous, peoples, he, proceeded, to, experiment, on, himself, and, upon, his, return, to, milan, he, wrote, a, paper, in, which, he, described, the, effects, in, this, paper, he, declared, coca, and, cocaine, at, the, time, they, were, assumed, to, be, the, same, as, being, useful, medicinally, in, the, treatment, of, a, furred, tongue, in, the, morning, flatulence, and, whitening, of, the, teeth, a, chemist, named, angelo, mariani, who, read, mantegazza, s, paper, became, immediately, intrigued, with, coca, and, its, economic, potential, in, 1863, mariani, started, marketing, a, wine, called, vin, mariani, which, had, been, treated, with, coca, leaves, to, become, coca, wine, the, ethanol, in, wine, acted, as, a, solvent, and, extracted, the, cocaine, from, the, coca, leaves, altering, the, drink, s, effect, it, contained, 6, mg, cocaine, per, ounce, of, wine, but, vin, mariani, which, was, to, be, exported, contained, 7, 2, mg, per, ounce, to, compete, with, the, higher, cocaine, content, of, similar, drinks, in, the, united, states, a, pinch, of, coca, leaves, was, included, in, john, styth, pemberton, s, original, 1886, recipe, for, coca, cola, though, the, company, began, using, decocainized, leaves, in, 1906, when, the, pure, food, and, drug, act, was, passed, in, 1879, cocaine, began, to, be, used, to, treat, morphine, addiction, cocaine, was, introduced, into, clinical, use, as, a, local, anesthetic, in, germany, in, 1884, about, the, same, time, as, sigmund, freud, published, his, work, ber, coca, in, which, he, wrote, that, cocaine, causes, exhilaration, and, lasting, euphoria, which, in, no, way, differs, from, the, normal, euphoria, of, the, healthy, person, you, perceive, an, increase, of, self, control, and, possess, more, vitality, and, capacity, for, work, in, other, words, you, are, simply, normal, and, it, is, soon, hard, to, believe, you, are, under, the, influence, of, any, drug, long, intensive, physical, work, is, performed, without, any, fatigue, this, result, is, enjoyed, without, any, of, the, unpleasant, after, effects, that, follow, exhilaration, brought, about, by, alcoholic, beverages, no, craving, for, the, further, use, of, cocaine, appears, after, the, first, or, even, after, repeated, taking, of, the, drug, by, 1885, the, u, s, manufacturer, parke, davis, sold, coca, leaf, cigarettes, and, cheroots, a, cocaine, inhalant, a, coca, cordial, cocaine, crystals, and, cocaine, solution, for, intravenous, injection, the, company, promised, that, its, cocaine, products, would, supply, the, place, of, food, make,

year, later, on, his, ill, fated, journey, to, the, south, pole, in, the, 1931, song, minnie, the, moocher, cab, calloway, heavily, references, cocaine, use, he, uses, the, phrase, kicking, the, gong, around, slang, for, cocaine, use, describes, titular, character, minnie, as, tall, and, skinny, and, describes, smokey, joe, as, cokey, in, the, 1932, comedy, musical, film, the, big, broadcast, cab,

including, age, demographics, economic, social, political, religious, and, livelihood, in, the, united, states, the, development, of, crack, cocaine, introduced, the, substance, to, a, generally, poorer, inner, city, market, the, use, of, the, powder, form, has, stayed, relatively, constant, experiencing, a, new, height, of, use, across, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, in, the, u, s, however, from, 2006, to, 2010, cocaine, use, in, the, us, declined, by, roughly, half, before, again, rising, once, again, from, 2017, onwards, in, the, uk, cocaine, use, increased, significantly, between, the, 1990s, and, late, 2000s, with, a, similar, high, consumption, in, some, other, european, countries, including, spain, the, estimated, u, s, cocaine, market, exceeded, us, 70, billion, in, street,

the, world, health, organization, who, and, the, united, nations, interregional, crime, and, justice, research, institute, unicri, announced, in, a, press, release, the, publication, of, the, results, of, the, largest, global, study, on, cocaine, use, ever, undertaken, an, american, representative, in, the, world, health, assembly, banned, the, publication, of, the, study, because, it, seemed, to, make, a, case, for, the, positive, uses, of, cocaine, an, excerpt, of, the, report, strongly, conflicted, with, accepted, paradigms, for, example, that, occasional, cocaine, use, does, not, typically, lead, to, severe, or, even, minor, physical, or, social, problems, in, the, sixth, meeting, of, the, b, committee, the, us, representative, threatened, that, if, world, health, organization, activities, relating, to, drugs, failed, to, reinforce, proven, drug, control, approaches, funds, for, the, relevant, programs, should, be, curtailed, this, led, to, the, decision, to, discontinue, publication, a, part, of, the, study, was, recuperated, and, published, in, 2010, including, profiles, of, cocaine, use, in, 20, countries, but, are, unavailable, as, of, 2015, in, october, 2010, it, was, reported, that, the, use, of, cocaine, in, australia, has, doubled, since, monitoring, began, in, 2003, a, problem, with, illegal, cocaine, use, especially, in, the, higher, volumes, used, to, combat, fatigue, rather, than, increase, euphoria, by, long, term, users, is, the, risk, of, ill, effects, or, damage, caused, by, the, compounds, used, in, adulteration, cutting, or, stepping, on, the, drug, is, commonplace, using, compounds, which, simulate, ingestion, effects, such, as, novocain, procaine, producing, temporary, anesthesia, as, many, users, believe, a, strong, numbing, effect, is, the, result, of, strong, and, or, pure, cocaine, ephedrine, or, similar, stimulants, that, are, to, produce, an, increased, heart, rate, the, normal, adulterants, for, profit, are, inactive, sugars, usually, mannitol, creatine, or, glucose, so, introducing, active, adulterants, gives, the, illusion, of, purity, and, to, stretch, or, make, it, so, a, dealer, can, sell, more, product, than, without, the, adulterants, however, the, purity, of, the, cocaine, is, subsequently, lowered, the, adulterant, of, sugars, allows, the, dealer, to, sell, the, product, for, a, higher, price, because, of, the, illusion, of, purity, and, allows, the, sale, of, more, of, the, product, at, that, higher, price, enabling, dealers, to, significantly, increase, revenue, with, little, additional, cost, for, the, adulterants, a, 2007, study, by, the, european, monitoring, centre, for, drugs, and, drug, addiction, showed, that, the, purity, levels, for, street, purchased, cocaine, was, often, under, 5, and, on, average, under, 50, pure, the, production, distribution, and, sale, of, cocaine, products, is, restricted, and, illegal, in, most, contexts, in, most, countries, as, regulated, by, the,

the, cultivation, of, coca, leaf, for, traditional, consumption, by, the, local, indigenous, population, but, nevertheless, prohibit, the, production, sale, and, consumption, of, cocaine, the, provisions, as, to, how, much, a, coca, farmer, can, yield, annually, is, protected, by, laws, such, as, the, bolivian, cato, accord, in, addition, some, parts, of, europe, the, united, states, and,

drug, trafficking, the, us, federal, government, instituted, a, national, labeling, requirement, for, cocaine, and, cocaine, containing, products, through, the, pure, food, and, drug, act, of, 1906, the, next, important, federal, regulation, was, the, harrison, narcotics, tax, act, of, 1914, while, this, act, is, often, seen, as, the, start, of, prohibition, the, act, itself, was, not, actually, a, prohibition, on, cocaine, but, instead, set, up, a, regulatory, and, licensing, regime, the, harrison, act, did, not, recognize, addiction, as, a, treatable, condition, and, therefore, the, therapeutic, use, of, cocaine, heroin, or, morphine, to, such, individuals, was, outlawed, leading, a, 1915, editorial, in, the, journal, american, medicine, to, remark, that, the, addict, is, denied, the, medical, care, he, urgently, needs, open, above, board, sources, from, which, he, formerly, obtained, his, drug, supply, are, closed, to, him, and, he, is, driven, to, the, underworld, where, he, can, get, his, drug, but, of, course, surreptitiously, and, in, violation, of, the, law, the, harrison, act, left, manufacturers, of, cocaine, untouched, so, long, as, they, met, certain, purity, and, labeling, standards, despite, that, cocaine, was, typically, illegal, to, sell, and, legal, outlets, were, rarer, the, quantities, of, legal, cocaine, produced, declined, very, little, legal, cocaine, quantities, did, not, decrease, until, the, jones, miller, act, of, 1922, put, serious, restrictions, on, cocaine, manufactures, before, the, early, 1900s, the, primary, problem, caused, by, cocaine, use, was, portrayed, by, newspapers, to, be, addiction, not, violence, or, crime, and, the, cocaine, user, was, represented, as, an, upper, or, middle, class, white, person, in, 1914, the, new, york, times, published, an, article, titled, negro, cocaine, fiends, are, a, new, southern, menace, portraying, black, cocaine, users, as, dangerous, and, able, to, withstand, wounds, that, would, normally, be, fatal, the, anti, drug, abuse, act, of, 1986, mandated, the, same, prison, sentences, for, distributing, 500, grams, of, powdered, cocaine, and, just, 5, grams, of, crack, cocaine, in, the, national, survey, on, drug, use, and, health, white, respondents, reported, a, higher, rate, of, powdered, cocaine, use, and, black, respondents, reported, a, higher, rate, of, crack, cocaine, use,

three, quarters, of, the, world, s, annual, yield, of, cocaine, has, been, produced, in, colombia, both, from, cocaine, base, imported, from, peru, primarily, the, huallaga, valley, and, bolivia, and, from, locally, grown, coca, there, was, a, 28, increase, in, the, amount, of, potentially, harvestable, coca, plants, which, were, grown, in, colombia, in, 1998, this, combined, with, crop, reductions, in, bolivia, and, peru, made, colombia, the, nation, with, the, largest, area, of, coca, under, cultivation, after, the, mid, 1990s, coca, grown, for, traditional, purposes, by, indigenous, communities, a, use, which, is, still, present, and, is, permitted, by, colombian, laws, only, makes, up, a, small, fragment, of, total, coca, production, most, of, which, is, used, for, the, illegal, drug, trade, an, interview, with, a, coca, farmer, published, in, 2003, described, a, mode, of, production, by, acid, base, extraction, that, has, changed, little, since, 1905, roughly, 625, pounds, 283, kg, of, leaves, were, harvested, per, hectare, six, times, per, year, the, leaves, were, dried, for, half, a, day, then, chopped, into, small, pieces, with, a, string, trimmer, and, sprinkled, with, a, small, amount, of, powdered, cement, replacing, sodium, carbonate, from, former, times, several, hundred, pounds, of, this, mixture, were, soaked, in, 50, us, gallons, 190, l, of, gasoline, for, a, day, then, the, gasoline, was, removed, and, the, leaves, were, pressed, for, the, remaining, liquid, after, which, they, could, be, discarded, then, battery, acid, weak, sulfuric, acid, was, used, one, bucket, per, 55, lb, 25, kg, of, leaves, to, create, a, phase, separation, in, which, the, cocaine, free, base, in, the, gasoline, was, acidified, and, extracted, into, a, few, buckets, of, murky, looking, smelly, liquid, once, powdered, caustic, soda, was, added, to, this, the, cocaine, precipitated, and, could, be, removed, by, filtration, through, a, cloth, the, resulting, material, when, dried, was, termed, pasta, and, sold, by, the, farmer, the, 3, 750, pounds, 1, 700, kg, yearly, harvest, of, leaves, from, a, hectare, produced, 6, lb, 2, 5, kg, of, pasta, approximately, 40, 60, cocaine, repeated, recrystallization, from, solvents, producing, pasta, lavada, and, eventually, crystalline, cocaine, were, performed, at, specialized, laboratories, after, the, sale, attempts, to, eradicate, coca, fields, through, the, use, of, defoliants, have, devastated, part, of, the, farming, economy, in, some, coca, growing, regions, of, colombia, and, strains, appear, to, have, been, developed, that, are, more, resistant, or, immune, to, their, use, whether, these, strains, are, natural, mutations, or, the, product, of, human, tampering, is, unclear, these, strains, have, also, shown, to, be, more, potent, than, those, previously, grown, increasing, profits, for, the, drug, cartels, responsible, for, the, exporting, of, cocaine, although, production, fell, temporarily, coca, crops, rebounded, in, numerous, smaller, fields, in, colombia, rather, than, the, larger, plantations, the, cultivation, of, coca, has, become, an, attractive, economic, decision, for, many, growers, due, to, the, combination, of, several, factors, including, the, lack, of, other, employment, alternatives, the, lower, profitability, of, alternative, crops, in, official, crop, substitution, programs, the, eradication, related, damages, to, non, drug, farms, the, spread, of, new, strains, of, the, coca, plant, due, to, persistent, worldwide, demand, the, latest, estimate, provided, by, the, u, s, authorities, on, the, annual, production, of, cocaine, in, colombia, refers, to, 290, metric, tons, as, of, the, end, of, 2011, the, seizure, operations, of,

populations, sophisticated, drug, subs, are, the, latest, tool, drug, runners, are, using, to, bring, cocaine, north, from, colombia, it, was, reported, on, 20, march, 2008, although, the, vessels, were, once, viewed, as, a, quirky, sideshow, in, the, drug, war, they, are, becoming, faster, more, seaworthy, and, capable, of, carrying, bigger, loads, of, drugs, than, earlier, models, according, to, those, charged, with, catching, them, cocaine, is, readily, available, in, all, major, countries, metropolitan, areas, according, to, the, summer, 1998, pulse, check, published, by, the, u, s, office, of, national, drug, control, policy, cocaine, use, had, stabilized, across, the, country, with, a, few, increases, reported, in, san, diego, bridgeport, miami, and, boston, in, the, west,

lasts, 12, 24, times, longer, with, each, dose, nevertheless, the, number, of, cocaine, users, remain, high, with, a, large, concentration, among, urban, youth, in, addition, to, the, amounts, previously, mentioned, cocaine, can, be, sold, in, bill, sizes, as, of, 2007, for, example, 10, might, purchase, a, dime, bag, a, very, small, amount, 0, 1, 0, 15, g, of, cocaine, these, amounts, and, prices, are, very, popular, among, young, people, because, they, are, inexpensive, and, easily, concealed, on, one, s, body, quality, and, price, can, vary, dramatically, depending, on, supply, and, demand, and, on, geographic, region, in, 2008, the, european, monitoring, centre, for, drugs, and, drug, addiction, reports, that, the, typical, retail, price, of, cocaine, varied, between, 50, and, 75, per, gram, in, most, european, countries, although, cyprus, romania, sweden, and, turkey, reported, much, higher, values, world, annual, cocaine, consumption, as, of, 2000, stood, at, around, 600, tonnes, with, the, united, states, consuming, around, 300, t, 50, of, the, total, europe, about, 150, t, 25, of, the, total, and, the, rest, of, the, world, the, remaining, 150, t, or, 25, it, is, estimated, that, 1, 5, million, people, in, the, united, states, used, cocaine, in, 2010, down, from, 2, 4, million, in, 2006, conversely, cocaine, use, appears, to, be, increasing, in, europe, with, the, highest, prevalences, in, spain, the, united, kingdom, italy, and, ireland, the, 2010, un, world, drug, report, concluded, that, it, appears, that, the, north, american, cocaine, market, has, declined, in, value, from, us, 47, billion, in, 1998, to, us, 38, billion, in, 2008, between, 2006, and, 2008, the, value, of, the, market, remained, basically, stable
