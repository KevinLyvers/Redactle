mycology, is, the, branch, of, biology, concerned, with, the, study, of, fungi, including, their, taxonomy, genetics, biochemical, properties, and, use, by, humans, fungi, can, be, a, source, of, tinder, food, traditional, medicine, as, well, as, entheogens, poison, and, infection, mycology, branches, into, the, field, of, phytopathology, the, study, of, plant, diseases, the, two, disciplines, are, closely, related, because, the, vast, majority, of, plant, pathogens, are, fungi, a, biologist, specializing, in, mycology, is, called, a, mycologist, although, mycology, was, historically, considered, a, branch, of, botany, the, 1969, discovery, of, fungi, s, close, evolutionary, relationship, to, animals, resulted, in, the, study, s, reclassification, as, an, independent, field, pioneer, mycologists, included, elias, magnus, fries, christiaan, hendrik, persoon, heinrich, anton, de, bary, elizabeth, eaton, morse, and, lewis, david, de, schweinitz, beatrix, potter, author, of, the, tale, of, peter, rabbit, also, made, significant, contributions, to, the, field, pier, andrea, saccardo, developed, a, system, for, classifying, the, imperfect, fungi, by, spore, color, and, form, which, became, the, primary, system, used, before, classification, by, dna, analysis, he, is, most, famous, for, his, sylloge, fungorum, which, was, a, comprehensive, list, of, all, of, the, names, that, had, been, used, for, mushrooms, sylloge, is, still, the, only, work, of, this, kind, that, was, both, comprehensive, for, the, botanical, kingdom, fungi, and, reasonably, modern, many, fungi, produce, toxins, antibiotics, and, other, secondary, metabolites, for, example, the, cosmopolitan, genus, fusarium, and, their, toxins, associated, with, fatal, outbreaks, of, alimentary, toxic, aleukia, in, humans, were, extensively, studied, by, abraham, z, joffe, fungi, are, fundamental, for, life, on, earth, in, their, roles, as, symbionts, e, g, in, the, form, of, mycorrhizae, insect, symbionts, and, lichens, many, fungi, are, able, to, break, down, complex, organic, biomolecules, such, as, lignin, the, more, durable, component, of, wood, and, pollutants, such, as, xenobiotics, petroleum, and, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, by, decomposing, these, molecules, fungi, play, a, critical, role, in, the, global, carbon, cycle, fungi, and, other, organisms, traditionally, recognized, as, fungi, such, as, oomycetes, and, myxomycetes, slime, molds, often, are, economically, and, socially, important, as, some, cause, diseases, of, animals, including, humans, and, of, plants, apart, from, pathogenic, fungi, many, fungal, species, are, very, important, in, controlling, the, plant, diseases, caused, by, different, pathogens, for, example, species, of, the, filamentous, fungal, genus, trichoderma, are, considered, one, of, the, most, important, biological, control, agents, as, an, alternative, to, chemical, based, products, for, effective, crop, diseases, management, field, meetings, to, find, interesting, species, of, fungi, are, known, as, forays, after, the, first, such, meeting, organized, by, the, woolhope, naturalists, field, club, in, 1868, and, entitled, a, foray, among, the, funguses, some, fungi, can, cause, disease, in, humans, and, other, animals, the, study, of, pathogenic, fungi, that, infect, animals, is, referred, to, as, medical, mycology, it, is, believed, that, humans, started, collecting, mushrooms, as, food, in, prehistoric, times, mushrooms, were, first, written, about, in, the, works, of, euripides, 480, 406, bc, the, greek, philosopher, theophrastos, of, eresos, 371, 288, bc, was, perhaps, the, first, to, try, to, systematically, classify, plants, mushrooms, were, considered, to, be, plants, missing, certain, organs, it, was, later, pliny, the, elder, 23, 79, ad, who, wrote, about, truffles, in, his, encyclopedia, natural, history, the, word, mycology, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, muk, s, meaning, fungus, and, the, suffix, logia, meaning, study, fungi, and, truffles, are, neither, herbs, nor, roots, nor, flowers, nor, seeds, but, merely, the, superfluous, moisture, or, earth, of, trees, or, rotten, wood, and, of, other, rotting, things, this, is, plain, from, the, fact, that, all, fungi, and, truffles, especially, those, that, are, used, for, eating, grow, most, commonly, in, thundery, and, wet, weather, the, middle, ages, saw, little, advancement, in, the, body, of, knowledge, about, fungi, however, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, allowed, authors, to, dispel, superstitions, and, misconceptions, about, the, fungi, that, had, been, perpetuated, by, the, classical, authors, the, start, of, the, modern, age, of, mycology, begins, with, pier, antonio, micheli, s, 1737, publication, of, nova, plantarum, genera, published, in, florence, this, seminal, work, laid, the, foundations, for, the, systematic, classification, of, grasses, mosses, and, fungi, he, originated, the, still, current, genus, names, polyporus, and, tuber, both, dated, 1729, though, the, descriptions, were, later, amended, as, invalid, by, modern, rules, the, founding, nomenclaturist, carl, linnaeus, included, fungi, in, his, binomial, naming, system, in, 1753, where, each, type, of, organism, has, a, two, word, name, consisting, of, a, genus, and, species, whereas, up, to, then, organisms, were, often, designated, with, latin, phrases, containing, many, words, he, originated, the, scientific, names, of, numerous, well, known, mushroom, taxa, such, as, boletus, and, agaricus, which, are, still, in, use, today, during, this, period, fungi, were, still, considered, to, belong, to, the, plant, kingdom, so, they, were, categorized, in, his, species, plantarum, linnaeus, fungal, taxa, were, not, nearly, as, comprehensive, as, his, plant, taxa, however, grouping, together, all, gilled, mushrooms, with, a, stem, in, genus, agaricus, thousands, of, gilled, species, exist, which, were, later, divided, into, dozens, of, diverse, genera, in, its, modern, usage, agaricus, only, refers, to, mushrooms, closely, related, to, the, common, shop, mushroom, agaricus, bisporus, for, example, linnaeus, gave, the, name, agaricus, deliciosus, to, the, saffron, milk, cap, but, its, current, name, is, lactarius, deliciosus, on, the, other, hand, the, field, mushroom, agaricus, campestris, has, kept, the, same, name, ever, since, linnaeus, s, publication, the, english, word, agaric, is, still, used, for, any, gilled, mushroom, which, corresponds, to, linnaeus, s, use, of, the, word, the, term, mycology, and, the, complementary, term, mycologist, are, traditionally, attributed, to, m, j, berkeley, in, 1836, however, mycologist, appeared, in, writings, by, english, botanist, robert, kaye, greville, as, early, as, 1823, in, reference, to, schweinitz, for, centuries, certain, mushrooms, have, been, documented, as, a, folk, medicine, in, china, japan, and, russia, although, the, use, of, mushrooms, in, folk, medicine, is, centered, largely, on, the, asian, continent, people, in, other, parts, of, the, world, like, the, middle, east, poland, and, belarus, have, been, documented, using, mushrooms, for, medicinal, purposes, mushrooms, produce, large, amounts, of, vitamin, d, when, exposed, to, ultraviolet, uv, light, penicillin, ciclosporin, griseofulvin, cephalosporin, and, psilocybin, are, examples, of, drugs, that, have, been, isolated, from, molds, or, other, fungi
