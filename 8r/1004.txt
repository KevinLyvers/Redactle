see, subdivision, viola, is, a, genus, of, flowering, plants, in, the, violet, family, violaceae, it, is, the, largest, genus, in, the, family, containing, over, 680, species, most, species, are, found, in, the, temperate, northern, hemisphere, however, some, are, also, found, in, widely, divergent, areas, such, as, hawaii, australasia, and, the, andes, some, viola, species, are, perennial, plants, some, are, annual, plants, and, a, few, are, small, shrubs, many, species, varieties, and, cultivars, are, grown, in, gardens, for, their, ornamental, flowers, in, horticulture, the, term, pansy, is, normally, used, for, those, multi, colored, large, flowered, cultivars, which, are, raised, annually, or, biennially, from, seed, and, used, extensively, in, bedding, the, terms, viola, and, violet, are, normally, reserved, for, small, flowered, annuals, or, perennials, including, the, wild, species, annual, or, perennial, caulescent, or, acaulescent, with, or, without, a, visible, plant, stem, above, the, ground, herbs, shrubs, or, very, rarely, treelets, in, acaulescent, taxa, the, foliage, and, flowers, appear, to, rise, from, the, ground, the, remainder, have, short, stems, with, foliage, and, flowers, produced, in, the, axils, of, the, leaves, axillary, viola, typically, have, heart, shaped, or, reniform, kidney, shaped, scalloped, leaves, though, a, number, have, linear, or, palmate, leaves, the, simple, leaves, of, plants, with, either, habit, are, arranged, alternately, the, acaulescent, species, produce, basal, rosettes, plants, always, have, leaves, with, stipules, that, are, often, leaf, like, the, flowers, of, the, vast, majority, of, the, species, are, strongly, zygomorphic, with, bilateral, symmetry, and, solitary, but, occasionally, form, cymes, the, flowers, are, formed, from, five, petals, four, are, upswept, or, fan, shaped, with, two, per, side, and, there, is, one, broad, lobed, lower, petal, pointing, downward, this, petal, may, be, slightly, or, much, shorter, than, the, others, and, is, weakly, differentiated, the, shape, of, the, petals, and, placement, defines, many, species, for, example, some, species, have, a, spur, on, the, end, of, each, petal, while, most, have, a, spur, on, the, lower, petal, the, spur, may, vary, from, scarcely, exserted, projecting, to, very, long, such, as, in, viola, rostrata, solitary, flowers, end, long, stalks, with, a, pair, of, bracteoles, the, flowers, have, five, sepals, that, persist, after, blooming, and, in, some, species, the, sepals, enlarge, after, blooming, the, corolla, ranges, from, white, to, yellow, orange, or, various, shades, of, blue, and, violet, or, multicolored, often, blue, and, yellow, with, or, without, a, yellow, throat, the, flowers, have, five, free, stamens, with, short, free, filaments, that, are, oppressed, against, the, ovary, with, a, dorsal, connective, appendage, that, is, large, entire, and, oblong, to, ovate, only, the, lower, two, stamens, are, calcarate, possessing, nectary, spurs, that, are, inserted, on, the, lowest, petal, into, the, spur, or, a, pouch, the, styles, are, filiform, threadlike, or, clavate, clubshaped, thickened, at, their, tip, being, globose, to, rostellate, beaked, the, stigmas, are, head, like, narrowed, or, often, beaked, the, flowers, have, a, superior, ovary, with, one, cell, which, has, three, placentae, containing, many, ovules, after, flowering, fruit, capsules, are, produced, that, are, thick, walled, with, few, to, many, seeds, per, carpel, and, dehisce, split, open, by, way, of, three, valves, on, drying, the, capsules, may, eject, seeds, with, considerable, force, to, distances, of, several, meters, the, nutlike, seeds, which, are, obovoid, to, globose, are, typically, arillate, with, a, specialized, outgrowth, and, have, straight, embryos, flat, cotyledons, and, soft, fleshy, endosperm, that, is, oily, one, characteristic, of, some, viola, is, the, elusive, scent, of, their, flowers, along, with, terpenes, a, major, component, of, the, scent, is, a, ketone, compound, called, ionone, which, temporarily, desensitizes, the, receptors, of, the, nose, thus, preventing, any, further, scent, being, detected, from, the, flower, until, the, nerves, recover, first, formally, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1753, with, 19, species, the, genus, viola, bears, his, botanical, authority, l, when, jussieu, established, the, hierarchical, system, of, families, 1789, he, placed, viola, in, the, cisti, rock, roses, though, by, 1811, he, suggested, viola, be, separated, from, these, however, in, 1802, batsch, had, already, established, a, separate, family, which, he, called, violariae, based, on, viola, as, the, type, genus, with, seven, other, genera, although, violariae, continued, to, be, used, by, some, authors, such, as, bentham, and, hooker, in, 1862, as, violarieae, most, authors, adopted, the, alternative, name, violaceae, first, proposed, by, de, lamarck, and, de, candolle, in, 1805, and, gingins, 1823, and, saint, hilaire, 1824, however, de, candolle, also, used, violarieae, in, his, 1824, prodromus, viola, is, one, of, about, 25, genera, and, about, 600, species, in, the, large, eudicot, family, violaceae, divided, into, subfamilies, and, tribes, while, most, genera, are, monotypic, viola, is, a, very, large, genus, variously, circumscribed, as, having, between, 500, and, 600, species, historically, it, was, placed, in, subfamily, violoideae, tribe, violeae, but, these, divisions, have, been, shown, to, be, artificial, and, not, monophyletic, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, show, that, viola, occurs, in, clade, i, of, the, family, as, viola, schweiggeria, noisettia, and, allexis, in, which, schweiggeria, and, noisettia, are, monotypic, and, form, a, sister, group, to, viola, viola, is, a, large, genus, that, has, traditionally, been, treated, in, sections, one, of, these, was, that, of, gingins, 1823, based, on, stigma, morphology, with, five, sections, nomimium, dischidium, chamaemelanium, melanium, leptidium, the, extensive, taxonomic, studies, of, wilhelm, becker, culminating, in, his, 1925, conspectus, resulted, in, 14, sections, and, many, infrasectional, groups, the, largest, and, most, diverse, being, section, viola, with, 17, subsections, in, addition, to, subsections, series, were, also, described, alternatively, some, authors, have, preferred, to, subdivide, the, genus, into, subgenera, subsequent, treatments, were, by, gershoy, 1934, and, clausen, 1964, using, subsections, and, series, these, were, all, based, on, morphological, characteristics, subsequent, studies, using, molecular, phylogenetic, methods, such, as, that, of, ballard, et, al, 1998, have, shown, that, many, of, these, traditional, divisions, are, not, monophyletic, the, problem, being, related, to, a, high, degree, of, hybridization, in, particular, section, nomimium, was, dismembered, into, several, new, sections, and, transferring, part, of, it, to, section, viola, section, viola, s, lat, is, represented, by, four, sections, viola, sensu, stricto, plagiostigma, s, str, nosphinium, sensu, lato, and, the, v, spathulata, group, in, that, analysis, the, s, american, sections, appear, to, be, the, basal, groups, starting, with, rubellium, then, leptidium, however, the, exact, phylogenetic, relationships, remain, unresolved, as, a, consequence, many, different, taxonomic, nomenclatures, are, in, use, including, groupings, referred, to, as, grex, marcussen, et, al, place, the, five, s, american, sections, andinium, leptidium, tridens, rubellium, and, chilenium, at, the, base, of, the, phylogenetic, tree, in, that, order, these, are, followed, by, the, single, australian, section, erpetion, as, sister, group, to, chilenium, the, northern, hemisphere, sections, and, finally, the, single, african, section, v, abyssinica, these, sections, are, morphologically, chromosomally, and, geographically, distinct, seventeen, sections, are, recognized, listed, alphabetically, approximate, no, species, the, genus, includes, dog, violets, a, group, of, scentless, species, which, are, the, most, common, viola, in, many, areas, sweet, violet, viola, odorata, named, from, its, sweet, scent, and, many, other, species, whose, common, name, includes, the, word, violet, but, not, other, violets, neither, streptocarpus, sect, saintpaulia, african, violets, gesneriaceae, nor, erythronium, dens, canis, dogtooth, violets, liliaceae, are, related, to, viola, with, about, 113, species, the, south, american, section, andinium, is, the, largest, of, the, viola, sections, it, is, one, of, the, four, sections, distributed, primarily, or, exclusively, in, south, america, and, the, basal, group, of, viola, new, species, continue, to, be, identified, species, include, chamaemelanium, was, one, of, a, number, of, sections, originally, classified, on, the, basis, of, the, shape, of, the, stigma, in, this, case, one, that, was, facial, shaped, had, an, absent, beak, and, had, lateral, beards, but, this, section, has, subsequently, been, shown, to, be, paraphyletic, requiring, revision, it, occurs, at, high, altitudes, above, 600, m, in, both, n, america, and, northeast, asia, including, siberia, and, korea, and, the, species, are, perennial, caulous, and, herbaceous, with, about, 61, species, including, a, small, s, american, section, with, about, 8, species, as, sister, group, to, erpetion, including, section, danxiaviola, section, delphiniopsis, section, erpetion, section, leptidium, section, melanium, pansies, section, nosphinium, section, a, v, abyssinica, group, section, b, v, spathulata, group, section, plagiostigma, section, rubellium, section, sclerosium, section, tridens, section, viola, violets, section, xylinosium, one, fossil, seed, of, viola, rimosa, has, been, extracted, from, borehole, samples, of, the, middle, miocene, fresh, water, deposits, in, nowy, sacz, basin, west, carpathians, poland, the, genus, is, thought, to, have, arisen, in, s, america, most, likely, the, andes, habitat, fragmentation, has, been, shown, to, have, minimal, effect, on, the, genetic, diversity, and, gene, flow, of, the, north, american, woodland, violet, viola, pubescens, this, may, be, partially, attributed, to, the, ability, of, viola, pubescens, to, continue, to, persist, within, a, largely, agricultural, matrix, this, trend, of, unexpectedly, high, genetic, diversity, is, also, observed, in, viola, palmensis, a, canary, island, endemic, known, only, from, a, 15, square, kilometer, range, on, la, palma, island, high, levels, of, genetic, diversity, within, these, species, indicate, that, these, plants, are, outcrossing, even, though, many, violet, species, can, produce, many, clonal, offspring, throughout, the, year, via, cleistogamous, flowers, plants, that, produce, copious, amounts, of, clonal, seeds, from, cleistogamous, flowers, often, experience, increased, levels, of, inbreeding, these, reportedly, high, rates, of, outcrossing, and, genetic, diversity, indicate, that, these, violets, are, strong, competitors, for, pollinators, during, the, early, spring, when, they, are, in, bloom, and, that, those, pollinators, can, travel, considerable, distances, between, often, fragmented, populations, the, worldwide, northern, temperate, distribution, of, the, genus, distinguishes, it, from, the, remaining, largely, tropical, violaceae, genera, restricted, to, either, old, world, or, new, world, species, while, in, the, tropics, the, distribution, is, primarily, in, high, mountainous, areas, centres, of, diversity, occur, mainly, in, the, northern, hemisphere, in, mountainous, regions, of, eastern, asia, melanesia, and, southern, europe, but, also, occur, in, the, andes, and, the, southern, patagonian, cone, of, south, america, one, of, the, highest, species, concentrations, is, in, the, former, ussr, australia, is, home, to, a, number, of, viola, species, including, viola, hederacea, viola, betonicifolia, and, viola, banksii, first, collected, by, joseph, banks, and, daniel, solander, on, the, cook, voyage, to, botany, bay, viola, species, are, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, species, including, the, giant, leopard, moth, large, yellow, underwing, lesser, broad, bordered, yellow, underwing, high, brown, fritillary, small, pearl, bordered, fritillary, pearl, bordered, fritillary, regal, fritillary, cardinal, and, setaceous, hebrew, character, the, larvae, of, many, fritilary, butterfly, species, use, violets, as, an, obligate, host, plant, although, these, butterflies, do, not, always, ovaposit, directly, onto, violets, while, the, ecology, of, this, genera, is, extremely, diverse, violets, are, mainly, pollinated, by, members, within, the, orders, diptera, and, hymenoptera, showy, flowers, are, produced, in, early, spring, and, clonal, cleistogamous, flowers, are, produced, from, late, spring, until, the, end, of, the, growing, season, under, favorable, conditions, cleistogamy, allows, plants, to, produce, offspring, year, round, and, have, more, chances, for, establishment, this, system, is, especially, important, in, violets, as, these, plants, are, often, weak, competitors, for, pollination, due, to, their, small, size, many, violet, species, exhibit, two, modes, of, seed, dispersal, once, seed, capsules, have, matured, seeds, are, dispelled, around, the, plant, through, explosive, dehiscence, viola, pedata, seeds, have, been, reported, being, dispersed, distances, of, up, to, 5, meters, away, from, the, parent, plant, often, seeds, are, then, further, dispersed, by, ants, through, a, process, called, myrmecochory, violets, whose, seeds, are, dispersed, this, way, have, specialized, structures, on, the, exterior, of, the, seeds, called, elaiosomes, this, interaction, allows, violet, seed, to, germinate, and, establish, in, a, protected, stable, environment, many, violet, seeds, exhibit, physiological, dormancy, and, require, some, period, of, cold, stratification, to, induce, germination, under, ex, situ, conditions, rates, of, germination, are, often, quite, poor, especially, when, seeds, are, stored, for, extended, periods, of, time, in, north, american, habitat, restoration, native, violets, are, in, high, demand, due, to, their, relationship, with, the, aforementioned, fritillary, butterflies, violet, species, occupy, a, diverse, array, of, habitats, from, bogs, viola, lanceolata, to, dry, hill, prairies, v, pedata, to, woodland, understories, v, labradorica, while, many, of, these, species, are, indicators, of, high, quality, habitat, some, violets, are, capable, of, thriving, in, a, human, altered, landscape, two, species, of, zinc, violet, v, calaminaria, and, v, guestphalica, are, capable, of, living, in, soils, severely, contaminated, with, heavy, metals, many, violets, form, relationships, with, arbuscular, mycorrhizal, fungi, and, in, the, case, of, the, zinc, violets, this, allows, them, to, tolerate, such, highly, contaminated, soils, flowering, is, often, profuse, and, may, last, for, much, of, the, spring, and, summer, viola, are, most, often, spring, blooming, with, chasmogamous, flowers, that, have, well, developed, petals, pollinated, by, insects, many, species, also, produce, self, pollinated, cleistogamous, flowers, in, summer, and, autumn, that, do, not, open, and, lack, petals, in, some, species, the, showy, chasmogamous, flowers, are, infertile, e, g, viola, sororia, the, international, registration, authority, for, the, genus, is, the, american, violet, society, where, growers, register, new, viola, cultivars, a, coding, system, is, used, for, cultivar, description, of, ten, horticultural, divisions, such, as, violet, vt, and, violetta, vtta, examples, include, viola, little, david, vtta, and, viola, k, nigin, charlotte, vt, in, this, system, violets, vt, are, defined, as, stoloniferous, perennials, with, small, highly, fragrant, self, coloured, purple, blue, or, white, flowers, in, late, winter, and, early, spring, many, species, varieties, and, cultivars, are, grown, in, gardens, for, their, ornamental, flowers, in, horticulture, the, term, pansy, is, normally, used, for, those, multi, colored, large, flowered, cultivars, which, are, raised, annually, or, biennially, from, seed, and, used, extensively, in, bedding, the, terms, viola, and, violet, are, normally, reserved, for, small, flowered, annuals, or, perennials, including, the, wild, species, cultivars, of, viola, cornuta, viola, cucullata, and, viola, odorata, are, commonly, grown, from, seed, other, species, often, grown, include, viola, labradorica, viola, pedata, and, viola, rotundifolia, the, modern, garden, pansy, v, wittrockiana, is, a, plant, of, complex, hybrid, origin, involving, at, least, three, species, v, tricolor, wild, pansy, or, heartsease, v, altaica, and, v, lutea, mountain, pansy, the, hybrid, horned, pansy, v, williamsii, originates, from, hybridization, involving, garden, pansy, and, viola, cornuta, in, 2005, in, the, united, states, viola, cultivars, including, pansies, were, one, of, the, top, three, bedding, plant, crops, and, 111, million, dollars, worth, of, flats, of, viola, were, produced, for, the, bedding, flower, market, pansies, and, violas, used, for, bedding, are, generally, raised, from, seed, and, f1, hybrid, seed, strains, have, been, developed, which, produce, compact, plants, of, reasonably, consistent, flower, coloring, and, appearance, bedding, plants, are, usually, discarded, after, one, growing, season, there, are, hundreds, of, perennial, viola, and, violetta, cultivars, many, of, these, do, not, breed, true, from, seed, and, therefore, have, to, be, propagated, from, cuttings, violettas, can, be, distinguished, from, violas, by, the, lack, of, ray, markings, on, their, petals, the, following, cultivars, of, mixed, or, uncertain, parentage, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, other, popular, examples, include, when, newly, opened, viola, flowers, may, be, used, to, decorate, salads, or, in, stuffings, for, poultry, or, fish, souffl, s, cream, and, similar, desserts, can, be, flavoured, with, essence, of, viola, flowers, the, young, leaves, are, edible, raw, or, cooked, as, a, mild, tasting, leaf, vegetable, the, flowers, and, leaves, of, the, cultivar, rebecca, one, of, the, violetta, violets, have, a, distinct, vanilla, flavor, with, hints, of, wintergreen, the, pungent, perfume, of, some, varieties, of, v, odorata, adds, inimitable, sweetness, to, desserts, fruit, salads, and, teas, while, the, mild, pea, flavor, of, v, tricolor, combines, equally, well, with, sweet, or, savory, foods, like, grilled, meats, and, steamed, vegetables, the, heart, shaped, leaves, of, v, odorata, provide, a, free, source, of, greens, throughout, a, long, growing, season, while, the, petals, are, used, for, fragrant, flavoring, in, milk, puddings, and, ice, cream, or, in, salads, and, as, garnishes, a, candied, violet, or, crystallized, violet, is, a, flower, usually, of, viola, odorata, preserved, by, a, coating, of, egg, white, and, crystallised, sugar, alternatively, hot, syrup, is, poured, over, the, fresh, flower, or, the, flower, is, immersed, in, the, syrup, and, stirred, until, the, sugar, recrystallizes, and, has, dried, this, method, is, still, used, for, rose, petals, and, was, applied, to, orange, flowers, in, the, past, when, almonds, or, orange, peel, are, treated, this, way, they, are, called, pralines, candied, violets, are, still, made, commercially, in, toulouse, france, where, they, are, known, as, violettes, de, toulouse, they, are, used, as, decorating, cakes, or, trifles, or, included, in, aromatic, desserts, the, french, are, also, known, for, their, violet, syrup, most, commonly, made, from, an, extract, of, violets, in, the, united, states, this, french, violet, syrup, is, used, to, make, violet, scones, and, marshmallows, viola, essence, flavours, the, liqueurs, creme, yvette, creme, de, violette, and, parfait, d, amour, it, is, also, used, in, confectionery, such, as, parma, violets, and, c, howard, s, violet, candies, many, viola, species, contain, antioxidants, called, anthocyanins, fourteen, anthocyanins, from, v, yedoensis, and, v, prionantha, have, been, identified, some, anthocyanins, show, strong, antioxidant, activities, most, violas, tested, and, many, other, plants, of, the, family, violaceae, contain, cyclotides, which, have, a, diverse, range, of, in, vitro, biological, activities, when, isolated, from, the, plant, including, uterotonic, anti, hiv, antimicrobial, and, insecticidal, activities, viola, canescens, a, species, from, india, exhibited, in, vitro, activity, against, trypanosoma, cruzi, viola, has, been, evaluated, in, different, clinical, indications, in, human, studies, a, double, blind, clinical, trial, showed, that, the, adjuvant, use, of, viola, odorata, syrup, with, short, acting, agonists, can, improve, the, cough, suppression, in, children, with, asthma, in, another, study, intranasal, administration, of, viola, odorata, extract, oil, showed, to, be, effective, in, patients, with, insomnia, topical, use, of, an, herbal, formulation, containing, viola, tricolor, extract, also, showed, promising, effects, in, patients, with, mild, to, moderate, atopic, dermatitis, viola, odorata, is, used, as, a, source, for, scents, in, the, perfume, industry, violet, is, known, to, have, a, flirty, scent, as, its, fragrance, comes, and, goes, ionone, is, present, in, the, flowers, which, turns, off, the, ability, for, humans, to, smell, the, fragrant, compound, for, moments, at, a, time, violet, is, the, traditional, birth, flower, for, february, in, english, tradition, in, the, united, states, the, common, blue, violet, viola, sororia, is, the, state, flower, of, illinois, rhode, island, new, jersey, and, wisconsin, in, canada, the, viola, cucullata, is, the, provincial, flower, of, new, brunswick, adopted, in, 1936, in, the, united, kingdom, viola, riviniana, is, the, county, flower, of, lincolnshire, violets, became, symbolically, associated, with, romantic, love, between, women, this, connection, originates, from, fragments, of, a, poem, by, sappho, about, a, lost, love, in, which, she, describes, her, as, close, by, my, side, you, put, around, yourself, of, violets, and, roses, in, another, poem, sappho, describes, her, lost, love, as, wearing, violet, tiaras, braided, rosebuds, dill, and, crocus, twined, around, her, neck, in, 1926, one, of, the, first, plays, to, involve, a, lesbian, relationship, la, prisonni, re, by, douard, bourdet, used, a, bouquet, of, violets, to, signify, lesbian, love, violets, and, badges, depicting, them, were, sold, in, fund, raising, efforts, in, australia, and, new, zealand, on, and, around, violet, day, in, commemoration, of, the, lost, soldiers, of, world, war, i
