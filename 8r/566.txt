snakes, are, elongated, limbless, reptiles, of, the, suborder, serpentes, s, r, p, n, t, i, z, like, all, other, squamates, snakes, are, ectothermic, amniote, vertebrates, covered, in, overlapping, scales, many, species, of, snakes, have, skulls, with, several, more, joints, than, their, lizard, ancestors, enabling, them, to, swallow, prey, much, larger, than, their, heads, cranial, kinesis, to, accommodate, their, narrow, bodies, snakes, paired, organs, such, as, kidneys, appear, one, in, front, of, the, other, instead, of, side, by, side, and, most, have, only, one, functional, lung, some, species, retain, a, pelvic, girdle, with, a, pair, of, vestigial, claws, on, either, side, of, the, cloaca, lizards, have, independently, evolved, elongate, bodies, without, limbs, or, with, greatly, reduced, limbs, at, least, twenty, five, times, via, convergent, evolution, leading, to, many, lineages, of, legless, lizards, these, resemble, snakes, but, several, common, groups, of, legless, lizards, have, eyelids, and, external, ears, which, snakes, lack, although, this, rule, is, not, universal, see, amphisbaenia, dibamidae, and, pygopodidae, living, snakes, are, found, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, and, on, most, smaller, land, masses, exceptions, include, some, large, islands, such, as, ireland, iceland, greenland, and, the, islands, of, new, zealand, as, well, as, many, small, islands, of, the, atlantic, and, central, pacific, oceans, additionally, sea, snakes, are, widespread, throughout, the, indian, and, pacific, oceans, around, thirty, families, are, currently, recognized, comprising, about, 520, genera, and, about, 3, 900, species, they, range, in, size, from, the, tiny, 10, 4, cm, long, 4, 1, in, barbados, threadsnake, to, the, reticulated, python, of, 6, 95, meters, 22, 8, ft, in, length, the, fossil, species, titanoboa, cerrejonensis, was, 12, 8, meters, 42, ft, long, snakes, are, thought, to, have, evolved, from, either, burrowing, or, aquatic, lizards, perhaps, during, the, jurassic, period, with, the, earliest, known, fossils, dating, to, between, 143, and, 167, ma, ago, the, diversity, of, modern, snakes, appeared, during, the, paleocene, epoch, c, 66, to, 56, ma, ago, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, the, oldest, preserved, descriptions, of, snakes, can, be, found, in, the, brooklyn, papyrus, most, species, of, snake, are, nonvenomous, and, those, that, have, venom, use, it, primarily, to, kill, and, subdue, prey, rather, than, for, self, defense, some, possess, venom, that, is, potent, enough, to, cause, painful, injury, or, death, to, humans, nonvenomous, snakes, either, swallow, prey, alive, or, kill, by, constriction, the, english, word, snake, comes, from, old, english, snaca, itself, from, proto, germanic, snak, an, cf, germanic, schnake, ring, snake, swedish, snok, grass, snake, from, proto, indo, european, root, s, n, g, o, to, crawl, to, creep, which, also, gave, sneak, as, well, as, sanskrit, n, g, snake, the, word, ousted, adder, as, adder, went, on, to, narrow, in, meaning, though, in, old, english, n, ddre, was, the, general, word, for, snake, the, other, term, serpent, is, from, french, ultimately, from, indo, european, serp, to, creep, which, also, gave, ancient, greek, h, rp, i, crawl, and, sanskrit, sarp, snake, all, modern, snakes, are, grouped, within, the, suborder, serpentes, in, linnean, taxonomy, part, of, the, order, squamata, though, their, precise, placement, within, squamates, remains, controversial, the, two, infraorders, of, serpentes, are, alethinophidia, and, scolecophidia, this, separation, is, based, on, morphological, characteristics, and, mitochondrial, dna, sequence, similarity, alethinophidia, is, sometimes, split, into, henophidia, and, caenophidia, with, the, latter, consisting, of, colubroid, snakes, colubrids, vipers, elapids, hydrophiids, and, atractaspids, and, acrochordids, while, the, other, alethinophidian, families, comprise, henophidia, while, not, extant, today, the, madtsoiidae, a, family, of, giant, primitive, python, like, snakes, was, around, until, 50, 000, years, ago, in, australia, represented, by, genera, such, as, wonambi, recent, molecular, studies, support, the, monophyly, of, the, clades, of, modern, snakes, scolecophidians, typhlopids, anomalepidids, alethinophidians, core, alethinophidians, uropeltids, cylindrophis, anomochilus, uropeltines, macrostomatans, booids, boids, pythonids, and, caenophidians, while, snakes, are, limbless, reptiles, evolved, from, and, grouped, with, lizards, there, are, many, other, species, of, lizards, that, have, lost, their, limbs, independently, but, which, superficially, look, similar, to, snakes, these, include, the, slowworm, glass, snake, and, amphisbaenians, leptotyphlopidae, gerrhopilidae, typhlopidae, xenophidiidae, anomalepididae, aniliidae, tropidophiidae, xenopeltidae, loxocemidae, pythonidae, boidae, bolyeridae, xenophidiidae, uropeltidae, anomochilidae, cylindrophiidae, acrochordidae, xenodermidae, pareidae, viperidae, homalopsidae, colubridae, lamprophiidae, elapidae, the, fossil, record, of, snakes, is, relatively, poor, because, snake, skeletons, are, typically, small, and, fragile, making, fossilization, uncommon, fossils, readily, identifiable, as, snakes, though, often, retaining, hind, limbs, first, appear, in, the, fossil, record, during, the, cretaceous, period, the, earliest, known, true, snake, fossils, members, of, the, crown, group, serpentes, come, from, the, marine, simoliophiids, the, oldest, of, which, is, the, late, cretaceous, cenomanian, age, haasiophis, terrasanctus, from, the, west, bank, dated, to, between, 112, and, 94, million, years, old, based, on, genomic, analysis, it, is, certain, that, snakes, descend, from, lizards, this, conclusion, is, also, supported, by, comparative, anatomy, and, the, fossil, record, 11, pythons, and, boas, primitive, groups, among, modern, snakes, have, vestigial, hind, limbs, tiny, clawed, digits, known, as, anal, spurs, which, are, used, to, grasp, during, mating, 11, the, families, leptotyphlopidae, and, typhlopidae, also, possess, remnants, of, the, pelvic, girdle, appearing, as, horny, projections, when, visible, front, limbs, are, nonexistent, in, all, known, snakes, this, is, caused, by, the, evolution, of, their, hox, genes, controlling, limb, morphogenesis, the, axial, skeleton, of, the, snakes, common, ancestor, like, most, other, tetrapods, had, regional, specializations, consisting, of, cervical, neck, thoracic, chest, lumbar, lower, back, sacral, pelvic, and, caudal, tail, vertebrae, early, in, snake, evolution, the, hox, gene, expression, in, the, axial, skeleton, responsible, for, the, development, of, the, thorax, became, dominant, as, a, result, the, vertebrae, anterior, to, the, hindlimb, buds, when, present, all, have, the, same, thoracic, like, identity, except, from, the, atlas, axis, and, 1, 3, neck, vertebrae, in, other, words, most, of, a, snake, s, skeleton, is, an, extremely, extended, thorax, ribs, are, found, exclusively, on, the, thoracic, vertebrae, neck, lumbar, and, pelvic, vertebrae, are, very, reduced, in, number, only, 2, 10, lumbar, and, pelvic, vertebrae, are, present, while, only, a, short, tail, remains, of, the, caudal, vertebrae, however, the, tail, is, still, long, enough, to, be, of, important, use, in, many, species, and, is, modified, in, some, aquatic, and, tree, dwelling, species, many, modern, snake, groups, originated, during, the, paleocene, alongside, the, adaptive, radiation, of, mammals, following, the, extinction, of, non, avian, dinosaurs, the, expansion, of, grasslands, in, north, america, also, led, to, an, explosive, radiation, among, snakes, previously, snakes, were, a, minor, component, of, the, north, american, fauna, but, during, the, miocene, the, number, of, species, and, their, prevalence, increased, dramatically, with, the, first, appearances, of, vipers, and, elapids, in, north, america, and, the, significant, diversification, of, colubridae, including, the, origin, of, many, modern, genera, such, as, nerodia, lampropeltis, pituophis, and, pantherophis, there, is, fossil, evidence, to, suggest, that, snakes, may, have, evolved, from, burrowing, lizards, during, the, cretaceous, period, an, early, fossil, snake, relative, najash, rionegrina, was, a, two, legged, burrowing, animal, with, a, sacrum, and, was, fully, terrestrial, najash, which, lived, 95, million, years, ago, also, had, a, skull, with, several, features, typical, for, lizards, but, had, evolved, some, of, the, mobile, skull, joints, that, define, the, flexible, skull, in, most, modern, snakes, the, species, did, not, show, any, resemblances, to, the, modern, burrowing, blind, snakes, which, have, often, been, seen, as, the, most, primitive, group, of, extant, forms, one, extant, analog, of, these, putative, ancestors, is, the, earless, monitor, lanthanotus, of, borneo, though, it, is, also, semiaquatic, subterranean, species, evolved, bodies, streamlined, for, burrowing, and, eventually, lost, their, limbs, according, to, this, hypothesis, features, such, as, the, transparent, fused, eyelids, brille, and, loss, of, external, ears, evolved, to, cope, with, fossorial, difficulties, such, as, scratched, corneas, and, dirt, in, the, ears, some, primitive, snakes, are, known, to, have, possessed, hindlimbs, but, their, pelvic, bones, lacked, a, direct, connection, to, the, vertebrae, these, include, fossil, species, like, haasiophis, pachyrhachis, and, eupodophis, which, are, slightly, older, than, najash, this, hypothesis, was, strengthened, in, 2015, by, the, discovery, of, a, 113, million, year, old, fossil, of, a, four, legged, snake, in, brazil, that, has, been, named, tetrapodophis, amplectus, it, has, many, snake, like, features, is, adapted, for, burrowing, and, its, stomach, indicates, that, it, was, preying, on, other, animals, it, is, currently, uncertain, if, tetrapodophis, is, a, snake, or, another, species, in, the, squamate, order, as, a, snake, like, body, has, independently, evolved, at, least, 26, times, tetrapodophis, does, not, have, distinctive, snake, features, in, its, spine, and, skull, a, study, in, 2021, places, the, animal, in, a, group, of, extinct, marine, lizards, from, the, cretaceous, period, known, as, dolichosaurs, and, not, directly, related, to, snakes, an, alternative, hypothesis, based, on, morphology, suggests, the, ancestors, of, snakes, were, related, to, mosasaurs, extinct, aquatic, reptiles, from, the, cretaceous, forming, the, clade, pythonomorpha, according, to, this, hypothesis, the, fused, transparent, eyelids, of, snakes, are, thought, to, have, evolved, to, combat, marine, conditions, corneal, water, loss, through, osmosis, and, the, external, ears, were, lost, through, disuse, in, an, aquatic, environment, this, ultimately, led, to, an, animal, similar, to, today, s, sea, snakes, in, the, late, cretaceous, snakes, recolonized, land, and, continued, to, diversify, into, today, s, snakes, fossilized, snake, remains, are, known, from, early, late, cretaceous, marine, sediments, which, is, consistent, with, this, hypothesis, particularly, so, as, they, are, older, than, the, terrestrial, najash, rionegrina, similar, skull, structure, reduced, or, absent, limbs, and, other, anatomical, features, found, in, both, mosasaurs, and, snakes, lead, to, a, positive, cladistical, correlation, although, some, of, these, features, are, shared, with, varanids, genetic, studies, in, recent, years, have, indicated, snakes, are, not, as, closely, related, to, monitor, lizards, as, was, once, believed, and, therefore, not, to, mosasaurs, the, proposed, ancestor, in, the, aquatic, scenario, of, their, evolution, however, more, evidence, links, mosasaurs, to, snakes, than, to, varanids, fragmented, remains, found, from, the, jurassic, and, early, cretaceous, indicate, deeper, fossil, records, for, these, groups, which, may, potentially, refute, either, hypothesis, both, fossils, and, phylogenetic, studies, demonstrate, that, snakes, evolved, from, lizards, hence, the, question, became, which, genetic, changes, led, to, limb, loss, in, the, snake, ancestor, limb, loss, is, actually, very, common, in, extant, reptiles, and, has, happened, dozens, of, times, within, skinks, anguids, and, other, lizards, in, 2016, two, studies, reported, that, limb, loss, in, snakes, is, associated, with, dna, mutations, in, the, zone, of, polarizing, activity, regulatory, sequence, zrs, a, regulatory, region, of, the, sonic, hedgehog, gene, which, is, critically, required, for, limb, development, more, advanced, snakes, have, no, remnants, of, limbs, but, basal, snakes, such, as, pythons, and, boas, do, have, traces, of, highly, reduced, vestigial, hind, limbs, python, embryos, even, have, fully, developed, hind, limb, buds, but, their, later, development, is, stopped, by, the, dna, mutations, in, the, zrs, there, are, about, 3, 900, species, of, snakes, ranging, as, far, northward, as, the, arctic, circle, in, scandinavia, and, southward, through, australia, snakes, can, be, found, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, as, well, as, in, the, sea, and, as, high, as, 16, 000, feet, 4, 900, m, in, the, himalayan, mountains, of, asia, 143, there, are, numerous, islands, from, which, snakes, are, absent, such, as, ireland, iceland, and, new, zealand, although, new, zealand, s, northern, waters, are, infrequently, visited, by, the, yellow, bellied, sea, snake, and, the, banded, sea, krait, the, now, extinct, titanoboa, cerrejonensis, was, 12, 8, m, 42, ft, in, length, by, comparison, the, largest, extant, snakes, are, the, reticulated, python, measuring, about, 6, 95, m, 22, 8, ft, long, and, the, green, anaconda, which, measures, about, 5, 21, m, 17, 1, ft, long, and, is, considered, the, heaviest, snake, on, earth, at, 97, 5, kg, 215, lb, at, the, other, end, of, the, scale, the, smallest, extant, snake, is, leptotyphlops, carlae, with, a, length, of, about, 10, 4, cm, 4, 1, in, most, snakes, are, fairly, small, animals, approximately, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, in, length, some, of, the, most, highly, developed, sensory, systems, are, found, in, the, crotalidae, or, pit, vipers, the, rattlesnakes, and, their, associates, pit, vipers, have, all, the, sense, organs, of, other, snakes, as, well, as, additional, aids, pit, refers, to, special, infrared, sensitive, receptors, located, on, either, side, of, the, head, between, the, nostrils, and, the, eyes, in, fact, the, pit, looks, like, an, extra, pair, of, nostrils, all, snakes, have, the, ability, to, sense, warmth, with, touch, and, heat, receptors, like, other, animals, however, the, highly, developed, pit, of, the, pit, vipers, is, distinctive, each, pit, is, made, of, a, pit, cavity, and, an, inner, cavity, the, larger, one, lies, just, behind, and, generally, below, the, level, of, the, nostril, and, opens, forward, behind, this, larger, cavity, is, a, finer, one, barely, visible, the, cavities, are, connected, internally, separated, only, by, a, membrane, with, nerves, that, are, extraordinarily, attuned, to, detecting, temperature, changes, between, as, in, the, overlapping, vision, fields, of, human, eyes, the, forward, facing, pit, on, either, side, of, the, face, combined, produces, a, field, of, vision, a, pit, viper, can, distinguish, between, objects, and, their, environments, as, well, as, accurately, judge, the, distance, between, objects, and, itself, the, heat, sensing, ability, of, a, pit, viper, is, so, great, that, it, can, react, to, a, difference, as, small, as, one, third, of, a, degree, fahrenheit, other, infrared, sensitive, snakes, have, multiple, smaller, labial, pits, lining, the, upper, lip, just, below, the, nostrils, a, snake, tracks, its, prey, using, smell, collecting, airborne, particles, with, its, forked, tongue, then, passing, them, to, the, vomeronasal, organ, or, jacobson, s, organ, in, the, mouth, for, examination, the, fork, in, the, tongue, provides, a, sort, of, directional, sense, of, smell, and, taste, simultaneously, the, snake, s, tongue, is, constantly, in, motion, sampling, particles, from, the, air, ground, and, water, analyzing, the, chemicals, found, and, determining, the, presence, of, prey, or, predators, in, the, local, environment, in, water, dwelling, snakes, such, as, the, anaconda, the, tongue, functions, efficiently, underwater, to, pick, up, particles, in, the, air, the, tongue, is, flicked, out, like, a, hand, getting, the, weight, of, something, the, fork, in, the, tongue, simultaneously, provides, a, sort, of, directional, sense, snakes, have, a, good, sense, of, smell, but, this, sense, is, greatly, enhanced, in, the, window, of, a, special, organ, the, jacobson, s, organ, as, the, tongue, is, peeled, back, into, the, mouth, the, forked, tip, is, pressed, into, the, cavities, of, the, jacobson, s, organ, withdrawn, to, a, point, the, tongue, and, the, jacobson, s, organ, work, in, concert, for, a, taste, smell, analysis, the, organ, itself, gives, the, snake, an, extrasensory, conduit, quite, literally, the, snake, gets, a, taste, of, the, neighborhood, capable, of, slithering, in, rooms, of, information, like, the, doors, are, open, up, until, as, late, as, the, mid, 20th, century, it, was, assumed, snakes, could, not, hear, in, fact, snakes, have, two, distinct, and, wholly, independent, systems, one, of, these, systems, the, somatic, involves, transmission, of, frequencies, through, ventral, skin, receptors, via, the, spine, the, other, system, involves, vibrations, that, are, transmitted, through, the, snake, s, attenuated, lung, to, the, brain, via, cranial, nerve, a, snake, s, sensitivity, to, vibration, is, extremely, high, in, a, quiet, room, a, snake, can, hear, someone, speaking, softly, snake, vision, varies, greatly, between, species, some, have, keen, eyesight, and, others, are, only, able, to, distinguish, light, from, dark, but, the, important, trend, is, that, a, snake, s, visual, perception, is, adequate, enough, to, track, movements, generally, vision, is, best, in, tree, dwelling, snakes, and, weakest, in, burrowing, snakes, some, have, binocular, vision, where, both, eyes, are, capable, of, focusing, on, the, same, point, an, example, of, this, being, the, asian, vine, snake, most, snakes, focus, by, moving, the, lens, back, and, forth, in, relation, to, the, retina, diurnal, snakes, have, round, pupils, and, many, nocturnal, snakes, have, slit, pupils, most, species, possess, three, visual, pigments, and, are, probably, able, to, see, two, primary, colors, in, daylight, the, annulated, sea, snake, and, the, genus, helicops, appears, to, have, regained, much, of, their, color, vision, as, an, adaption, to, the, marine, environment, they, live, in, it, has, been, concluded, that, the, last, common, ancestors, of, all, snakes, had, uv, sensitive, vision, but, most, snakes, that, depend, on, their, eyesight, to, hunt, in, daylight, have, evolved, lenses, that, act, like, sunglasses, for, filtering, out, the, uv, light, which, probably, also, sharpens, their, vision, by, improving, the, contrast, the, skin, of, a, snake, is, covered, in, scales, contrary, to, the, popular, notion, of, snakes, being, slimy, because, of, possible, confusion, of, snakes, with, worms, snakeskin, has, a, smooth, dry, texture, most, snakes, use, specialized, belly, scales, to, travel, allowing, them, to, grip, surfaces, the, body, scales, may, be, smooth, keeled, or, granular, the, eyelids, of, a, snake, are, transparent, spectacle, scales, also, known, as, brille, which, remain, permanently, closed, for, a, snake, the, skin, has, been, modified, to, its, specialized, form, of, locomotion, between, the, inner, layer, and, the, outer, layer, lies, the, dermis, which, contains, all, the, pigments, and, cells, that, make, up, the, snake, s, distinguishing, pattern, and, color, the, epidermis, or, outer, layer, is, formed, of, a, substance, called, keratin, which, in, mammals, is, the, same, basic, material, that, forms, nails, claws, and, hair, the, snake, s, epidermis, of, keratin, provides, it, with, the, armor, it, needs, to, protect, its, internal, organs, and, reduce, friction, as, it, passes, over, rocks, parts, of, this, keratin, armor, are, rougher, than, others, the, less, restricted, portion, overlaps, the, front, of, the, scale, beneath, it, between, them, lies, a, folded, back, connecting, material, also, of, keratin, also, part, of, the, epidermis, this, folded, back, material, gives, as, the, snake, undulates, or, eats, things, bigger, than, the, circumference, of, its, body, the, shedding, of, scales, is, called, ecdysis, or, in, normal, usage, molting, or, sloughing, snakes, shed, the, complete, outer, layer, of, skin, in, one, piece, snake, scales, are, not, discrete, but, extensions, of, the, epidermis, hence, they, are, not, shed, separately, but, as, a, complete, outer, layer, during, each, molt, akin, to, a, sock, being, turned, inside, out, snakes, have, a, wide, diversity, of, skin, coloration, patterns, which, are, often, related, to, behavior, such, as, the, tendency, to, have, to, flee, from, predators, snakes, that, are, at, a, high, risk, of, predation, tend, to, be, plain, or, have, longitudinal, stripes, providing, few, reference, points, to, predators, thus, allowing, the, snake, to, escape, without, being, noticed, plain, snakes, usually, adopt, active, hunting, strategies, as, their, pattern, allows, them, to, send, little, information, to, prey, about, motion, blotched, snakes, usually, use, ambush, based, strategies, likely, because, it, helps, them, blend, into, an, environment, with, irregularly, shaped, objects, like, sticks, or, rocks, spotted, patterning, can, similarly, help, snakes, to, blend, into, their, environment, the, shape, and, number, of, scales, on, the, head, back, and, belly, are, often, characteristic, and, used, for, taxonomic, purposes, scales, are, named, mainly, according, to, their, positions, on, the, body, in, advanced, caenophidian, snakes, the, broad, belly, scales, and, rows, of, dorsal, scales, correspond, to, the, vertebrae, allowing, these, to, be, counted, without, the, need, for, dissection, molting, or, ecdysis, serves, a, number, of, purposes, it, allows, old, worn, skin, to, be, replaced, and, can, be, synced, to, mating, cycles, as, with, other, animals, molting, occurs, periodically, throughout, the, life, of, a, snake, before, each, molt, the, snake, regulates, its, diet, and, seeks, defensible, shelter, just, before, shedding, the, skin, becomes, grey, and, the, snake, s, eyes, turn, silvery, the, inner, surface, of, the, old, skin, liquefies, causing, it, to, separate, from, the, new, skin, beneath, it, after, a, few, days, the, eyes, clear, and, the, snake, reaches, out, of, its, old, skin, which, splits, the, snake, rubs, its, body, against, rough, surfaces, to, aid, in, the, shedding, of, its, old, skin, in, many, cases, the, castaway, skin, peels, backward, over, the, body, from, head, to, tail, in, one, piece, like, taking, the, dust, jacket, off, a, book, revealing, a, new, larger, brighter, layer, of, skin, which, has, formed, underneath, renewal, of, the, skin, by, molting, supposedly, increases, the, mass, of, some, animals, such, as, insects, but, in, the, case, of, snakes, this, has, been, disputed, shedding, skin, can, release, pheromones, and, revitalize, color, and, patterns, of, the, skin, to, increase, attraction, of, mates, snakes, may, shed, four, of, five, times, a, year, depending, on, the, weather, conditions, food, supply, age, of, the, snake, and, other, factors, it, is, theoretically, possible, to, identify, the, snake, from, its, cast, skin, if, it, is, reasonably, intact, mythological, associations, of, snakes, with, symbols, of, healing, and, medicine, as, pictured, in, the, rod, of, asclepius, are, derivative, of, molting, one, can, attempt, to, identify, the, sex, of, a, snake, when, the, species, is, not, distinctly, sexually, dimorphic, by, counting, scales, the, cloaca, is, probed, and, measured, against, the, subcaudal, scales, counting, scales, determines, whether, a, snake, is, a, male, or, female, as, the, hemipenes, of, a, male, being, probed, is, usually, longer, the, skull, of, a, snake, differs, from, a, lizards, in, several, ways, snakes, have, more, flexible, jaws, that, is, instead, of, a, juncture, at, the, upper, and, lower, jaw, the, snake, s, jaws, are, connected, by, a, bone, hinge, that, is, called, the, quadrate, bone, between, the, two, halves, of, the, lower, jaw, at, the, chin, there, is, an, elastic, ligament, that, allows, for, a, separation, this, allows, the, snake, to, swallow, food, larger, in, proportion, to, their, size, and, go, longer, without, it, since, snakes, ingest, relatively, more, in, one, feeding, because, the, sides, of, the, lower, jaw, can, move, independently, of, one, another, a, snake, resting, its, jaw, on, a, surface, has, stereo, auditory, perception, used, for, detecting, the, position, of, prey, the, jaw, quadrate, stapes, pathway, is, capable, of, detecting, vibrations, on, the, angstrom, scale, despite, the, absence, of, an, outer, ear, and, the, lack, of, an, impedance, matching, mechanism, provided, by, the, ossicles, in, other, vertebrates, in, a, snake, s, skull, the, brain, is, well, protected, as, brain, tissues, could, be, damaged, through, the, palate, this, protection, is, especially, valuable, the, solid, and, complete, neurocranium, of, snakes, is, closed, at, the, front, the, skeleton, of, most, snakes, consists, solely, of, the, skull, hyoid, vertebral, column, and, ribs, though, henophidian, snakes, retain, vestiges, of, the, pelvis, and, rear, limbs, the, hyoid, is, a, small, bone, located, posterior, and, ventral, to, the, skull, in, the, neck, region, which, serves, as, an, attachment, for, the, muscles, of, the, snake, s, tongue, as, it, does, in, all, other, tetrapods, the, vertebral, column, consists, of, between, 200, and, 400, vertebrae, or, sometimes, more, the, body, vertebrae, each, have, two, ribs, articulating, with, them, the, tail, vertebrae, are, comparatively, few, in, number, often, less, than, 20, of, the, total, and, lack, ribs, the, vertebrae, have, projections, that, allow, for, strong, muscle, attachment, enabling, locomotion, without, limbs, caudal, autotomy, self, amputation, of, the, tail, a, feature, found, in, some, lizards, is, absent, in, most, snakes, in, the, rare, cases, where, it, does, exist, in, snakes, caudal, autotomy, is, intervertebral, meaning, the, separation, of, adjacent, vertebrae, unlike, that, in, lizards, which, is, intravertebral, i, e, the, break, happens, along, a, predefined, fracture, plane, present, on, a, vertebra, in, some, snakes, most, notably, boas, and, pythons, there, are, vestiges, of, the, hindlimbs, in, the, form, of, a, pair, of, pelvic, spurs, these, small, claw, like, protrusions, on, each, side, of, the, cloaca, are, the, external, portion, of, the, vestigial, hindlimb, skeleton, which, includes, the, remains, of, an, ilium, and, femur, snakes, are, polyphyodonts, with, teeth, that, are, continuously, replaced, snakes, and, other, non, archosaur, crocodilians, dinosaurs, birds, and, allies, reptiles, have, a, three, chambered, heart, that, controls, the, circulatory, system, via, the, left, and, right, atrium, and, one, ventricle, internally, the, ventricle, is, divided, into, three, interconnected, cavities, the, cavum, arteriosum, the, cavum, pulmonale, and, the, cavum, venosum, the, cavum, venosum, receives, deoxygenated, blood, from, the, right, atrium, and, the, cavum, arteriosum, receives, oxygenated, blood, from, the, left, atrium, located, beneath, the, cavum, venosum, is, the, cavum, pulmonale, which, pumps, blood, to, the, pulmonary, trunk, the, snake, s, heart, is, encased, in, a, sac, called, the, pericardium, located, at, the, bifurcation, of, the, bronchi, the, heart, is, able, to, move, around, owing, to, the, lack, of, a, diaphragm, this, adjustment, protects, the, heart, from, potential, damage, when, large, ingested, prey, is, passed, through, the, esophagus, the, spleen, is, attached, to, the, gall, bladder, and, pancreas, and, filters, the, blood, the, thymus, located, in, fatty, tissue, above, the, heart, is, responsible, for, the, generation, of, immune, cells, in, the, blood, the, cardiovascular, system, of, snakes, is, unique, for, the, presence, of, a, renal, portal, system, in, which, the, blood, from, the, snake, s, tail, passes, through, the, kidneys, before, returning, to, the, heart, the, circulatory, system, of, a, snake, is, basically, like, those, of, any, other, vertebrae, however, snakes, do, not, regulate, internally, the, temperature, of, their, blood, called, cold, blooded, snakes, actually, have, blood, that, is, responsive, to, the, varying, temperature, of, the, immediate, environment, snakes, can, regulate, blood, temperature, by, moving, too, long, in, direct, sunlight, the, snakes, blood, is, heated, by, beyond, tolerance, left, in, the, ice, or, snow, the, snake, may, freeze, in, temperate, zones, with, pronounced, seasonal, changes, snakes, denning, together, have, adapted, to, the, onslaught, of, winter, the, vestigial, left, lung, is, often, small, or, sometimes, even, absent, as, snakes, tubular, bodies, require, all, of, their, organs, to, be, long, and, thin, in, the, majority, of, species, only, one, lung, is, functional, this, lung, contains, a, vascularized, anterior, portion, and, a, posterior, portion, that, does, not, function, in, gas, exchange, this, saccular, lung, is, used, for, hydrostatic, purposes, to, adjust, buoyancy, in, some, aquatic, snakes, and, its, function, remains, unknown, in, terrestrial, species, many, organs, that, are, paired, such, as, kidneys, or, reproductive, organs, are, staggered, within, the, body, one, located, ahead, of, the, other, the, snake, with, its, particular, arrangement, of, organs, may, achieve, a, greater, efficiency, for, example, the, lung, encloses, at, the, part, nearest, the, head, and, throat, an, oxygen, intake, organ, while, the, other, half, is, used, for, air, reserve, the, esophagus, stomach, intestine, arrangement, is, a, straight, line, it, ends, where, intestinal, urinary, and, reproductive, tracts, open, in, a, chamber, called, the, cloaca, snakes, have, no, lymph, nodes, cobras, vipers, and, closely, related, species, use, venom, to, immobilize, injure, or, kill, their, prey, the, venom, is, modified, saliva, delivered, through, fangs, 243, the, fangs, of, advanced, venomous, snakes, like, viperids, and, elapids, are, hollow, allowing, venom, to, be, injected, more, effectively, and, the, fangs, of, rear, fanged, snakes, such, as, the, boomslang, simply, have, a, groove, on, the, posterior, edge, to, channel, venom, into, the, wound, snake, venoms, are, often, prey, specific, and, their, role, in, self, defense, is, secondary, 243, venom, like, all, salivary, secretions, is, a, predigestant, that, initiates, the, breakdown, of, food, into, soluble, compounds, facilitating, proper, digestion, even, nonvenomous, snakebites, like, any, animal, bite, cause, tissue, damage, 209, certain, birds, mammals, and, other, snakes, such, as, kingsnakes, that, prey, on, venomous, snakes, have, developed, resistance, and, even, immunity, to, certain, venoms, 243, venomous, snakes, include, three, families, of, snakes, and, do, not, constitute, a, formal, taxonomic, classification, group, the, colloquial, term, poisonous, snake, is, generally, an, incorrect, label, for, snakes, a, poison, is, inhaled, or, ingested, whereas, venom, produced, by, snakes, is, injected, into, its, victim, via, fangs, there, are, however, two, exceptions, rhabdophis, sequesters, toxins, from, the, toads, it, eats, then, secretes, them, from, nuchal, glands, to, ward, off, predators, and, a, small, unusual, population, of, garter, snakes, in, the, us, state, of, oregon, retains, enough, toxins, in, their, livers, from, ingested, newts, to, be, effectively, poisonous, to, small, local, predators, such, as, crows, and, foxes, snake, venoms, are, complex, mixtures, of, proteins, and, are, stored, in, venom, glands, at, the, back, of, the, head, in, all, venomous, snakes, these, glands, open, through, ducts, into, grooved, or, hollow, teeth, in, the, upper, jaw, 243, the, proteins, can, potentially, be, a, mix, of, neurotoxins, which, attack, the, nervous, system, hemotoxins, which, attack, the, circulatory, system, cytotoxins, which, attack, the, cells, directly, bungarotoxins, related, to, neurotoxins, but, also, directly, affect, muscle, tissue, and, many, other, toxins, that, affect, the, body, in, different, ways, almost, all, snake, venom, contains, hyaluronidase, an, enzyme, that, ensures, rapid, diffusion, of, the, venom, 243, venomous, snakes, that, use, hemotoxins, usually, have, fangs, in, the, front, of, their, mouths, making, it, easier, for, them, to, inject, the, venom, into, their, victims, some, snakes, that, use, neurotoxins, such, as, the, mangrove, snake, have, fangs, in, the, back, of, their, mouths, with, the, fangs, curled, backwards, this, makes, it, difficult, both, for, the, snake, to, use, its, venom, and, for, scientists, to, milk, them, elapids, however, such, as, cobras, and, kraits, are, proteroglyphous, they, possess, hollow, fangs, that, cannot, be, erected, toward, the, front, of, their, mouths, and, cannot, stab, like, a, viper, they, must, actually, bite, the, victim, 242, it, has, been, suggested, that, all, snakes, may, be, venomous, to, a, certain, degree, with, harmless, snakes, having, weak, venom, and, no, fangs, according, to, this, theory, most, snakes, that, are, labelled, nonvenomous, would, be, considered, harmless, because, they, either, lack, a, venom, delivery, method, or, are, incapable, of, delivering, enough, to, endanger, a, human, the, theory, postulates, that, snakes, may, have, evolved, from, a, common, lizard, ancestor, that, was, venomous, and, also, that, venomous, lizards, like, the, gila, monster, beaded, lizard, monitor, lizards, and, the, now, extinct, mosasaurs, may, have, derived, from, this, same, common, ancestor, they, share, this, venom, clade, with, various, other, saurian, species, venomous, snakes, are, classified, in, two, taxonomic, families, there, is, a, third, family, containing, the, opistoglyphous, rear, fanged, snakes, as, well, as, the, majority, of, other, snake, species, although, a, wide, range, of, reproductive, modes, are, used, by, snakes, all, employ, internal, fertilization, this, is, accomplished, by, means, of, paired, forked, hemipenes, which, are, stored, inverted, in, the, male, s, tail, the, hemipenes, are, often, grooved, hooked, or, spined, designed, to, grip, the, walls, of, the, female, s, cloaca, the, clitoris, of, the, female, snake, consists, of, two, structures, located, between, the, cloaca, and, the, scent, glands, most, species, of, snakes, lay, eggs, which, they, abandon, shortly, after, laying, however, a, few, species, such, as, the, king, cobra, construct, nests, and, stay, in, the, vicinity, of, the, hatchlings, after, incubation, most, pythons, coil, around, their, egg, clutches, and, remain, with, them, until, they, hatch, a, female, python, will, not, leave, the, eggs, except, to, occasionally, bask, in, the, sun, or, drink, water, she, will, even, shiver, to, generate, heat, to, incubate, the, eggs, some, species, of, snake, are, ovoviviparous, and, retain, the, eggs, within, their, bodies, until, they, are, almost, ready, to, hatch, several, species, of, snake, such, as, the, boa, constrictor, and, green, anaconda, are, fully, viviparous, nourishing, their, young, through, a, placenta, as, well, as, a, yolk, sac, this, is, highly, unusual, among, reptiles, and, normally, found, in, requiem, sharks, or, placental, mammals, retention, of, eggs, and, live, birth, are, most, often, associated, with, colder, environments, sexual, selection, in, snakes, is, demonstrated, by, the, 3, 000, species, that, each, use, different, tactics, in, acquiring, mates, ritual, combat, between, males, for, the, females, they, want, to, mate, with, includes, topping, a, behavior, exhibited, by, most, viperids, in, which, one, male, will, twist, around, the, vertically, elevated, fore, body, of, its, opponent, and, force, it, downward, it, is, common, for, neck, biting, to, occur, while, the, snakes, are, entwined, parthenogenesis, is, a, natural, form, of, reproduction, in, which, growth, and, development, of, embryos, occur, without, fertilization, agkistrodon, contortrix, copperhead, and, agkistrodon, piscivorus, cottonmouth, can, reproduce, by, facultative, parthenogenesis, meaning, that, they, are, capable, of, switching, from, a, sexual, mode, of, reproduction, to, an, asexual, mode, the, most, likely, type, of, parthenogenesis, to, occur, is, automixis, with, terminal, fusion, a, process, in, which, two, terminal, products, from, the, same, meiosis, fuse, to, form, a, diploid, zygote, this, process, leads, to, genome, wide, homozygosity, expression, of, deleterious, recessive, alleles, and, often, to, developmental, abnormalities, both, captive, born, and, wild, born, copperheads, and, cottonmouths, appear, to, be, capable, of, this, form, of, parthenogenesis, reproduction, in, squamate, reptiles, is, almost, exclusively, sexual, males, ordinarily, have, a, zz, pair, of, sex, determining, chromosomes, and, females, a, zw, pair, however, the, colombian, rainbow, boa, epicrates, maurus, can, also, reproduce, by, facultative, parthenogenesis, resulting, in, production, of, ww, female, progeny, the, ww, females, are, likely, produced, by, terminal, automixis, snake, embryonic, development, initially, follows, similar, steps, as, any, vertebrate, embryo, the, snake, embryo, begins, as, a, zygote, undergoes, rapid, cell, division, forms, a, germinal, disc, also, called, a, blastodisc, then, undergoes, gastrulation, neurulation, and, organogenesis, cell, division, and, proliferation, continues, until, an, early, snake, embryo, develops, and, the, typical, body, shape, of, a, snake, can, be, observed, multiple, features, differentiate, the, embryologic, development, of, snakes, from, other, vertebrates, two, significant, factors, being, the, elongation, of, the, body, and, the, lack, of, limb, development, the, elongation, in, snake, body, is, accompanied, by, a, significant, increase, in, vertebra, count, mice, have, 60, vertebrae, whereas, snakes, may, have, over, 300, this, increase, in, vertebrae, is, due, to, an, increase, in, somites, during, embryogenesis, leading, to, an, increased, number, of, vertebrae, which, develop, somites, are, formed, at, the, presomitic, mesoderm, due, to, a, set, of, oscillatory, genes, that, direct, the, somitogenesis, clock, the, snake, somitogenesis, clock, operates, at, a, frequency, 4, times, that, of, a, mouse, after, correction, for, developmental, time, creating, more, somites, and, therefore, creating, more, vertebrae, this, difference, in, clock, speed, is, believed, to, be, caused, by, differences, in, lunatic, fringe, gene, expression, a, gene, involved, in, the, somitogenesis, clock, there, is, ample, literature, focusing, on, the, limb, development, lack, of, development, in, snake, embryos, and, the, gene, expression, associated, with, the, different, stages, in, basal, snakes, such, as, the, python, embryos, in, early, development, exhibit, a, hind, limb, bud, that, develops, with, some, cartilage, and, a, cartilaginous, pelvic, element, however, this, degenerates, before, hatching, this, presence, of, vestigial, development, suggests, that, some, snakes, are, still, undergoing, hind, limb, reduction, before, they, are, eliminated, there, is, no, evidence, in, basal, snakes, of, forelimb, rudiments, and, no, examples, of, snake, forelimb, bud, initiation, in, embryo, so, little, is, known, regarding, the, loss, of, this, trait, recent, studies, suggest, that, hind, limb, reduction, could, be, due, to, mutations, in, enhancers, for, the, ssh, gene, however, other, studies, suggested, that, mutations, within, the, hox, genes, or, their, enhancers, could, contribute, to, snake, limblessness, since, multiple, studies, have, found, evidence, suggesting, different, genes, played, a, role, in, the, loss, of, limbs, in, snakes, it, is, likely, that, multiple, gene, mutations, had, an, additive, effect, leading, to, limb, loss, in, snakes, in, regions, where, winters, are, too, cold, for, snakes, to, tolerate, while, remaining, active, local, species, will, enter, a, period, of, brumation, unlike, hibernation, in, which, the, dormant, mammals, are, actually, asleep, brumating, reptiles, are, awake, but, inactive, individual, snakes, may, brumate, in, burrows, under, rock, piles, or, inside, fallen, trees, or, large, numbers, of, snakes, may, clump, together, in, hibernacula, all, snakes, are, strictly, carnivorous, preying, on, small, animals, including, lizards, frogs, other, snakes, small, mammals, birds, eggs, fish, snails, worms, and, insects, 81, snakes, cannot, bite, or, tear, their, food, to, pieces, so, must, swallow, their, prey, whole, the, eating, habits, of, a, snake, are, largely, influenced, by, body, size, smaller, snakes, eat, smaller, prey, juvenile, pythons, might, start, out, feeding, on, lizards, or, mice, and, graduate, to, small, deer, or, antelope, as, an, adult, for, example, the, snake, s, jaw, is, a, complex, structure, contrary, to, the, popular, belief, that, snakes, can, dislocate, their, jaws, they, have, an, extremely, flexible, lower, jaw, the, two, halves, of, which, are, not, rigidly, attached, and, numerous, other, joints, in, the, skull, which, allow, the, snake, to, open, its, mouth, wide, enough, to, swallow, prey, whole, even, if, it, is, larger, in, diameter, than, the, snake, itself, for, example, the, african, egg, eating, snake, has, flexible, jaws, adapted, for, eating, eggs, much, larger, than, the, diameter, of, its, head, 81, this, snake, has, no, teeth, but, does, have, bony, protrusions, on, the, inside, edge, of, its, spine, which, it, uses, to, break, the, shell, when, eating, eggs, 81, the, majority, of, snakes, eat, a, variety, of, prey, animals, but, there, is, some, specialization, in, certain, species, king, cobras, and, the, australian, bandy, bandy, consume, other, snakes, species, of, the, family, pareidae, have, more, teeth, on, the, right, side, of, their, mouths, than, on, the, left, as, they, mostly, prey, on, snails, and, the, shells, usually, spiral, clockwise, 184, some, snakes, have, a, venomous, bite, which, they, use, to, kill, their, prey, before, eating, it, other, snakes, kill, their, prey, by, constriction, while, some, swallow, their, prey, when, it, is, still, alive, 81, after, eating, snakes, become, dormant, to, allow, the, process, of, digestion, to, take, place, this, is, an, intense, activity, especially, after, consumption, of, large, prey, in, species, that, feed, only, sporadically, the, entire, intestine, enters, a, reduced, state, between, meals, to, conserve, energy, the, digestive, system, is, then, up, regulated, to, full, capacity, within, 48, hours, of, prey, consumption, being, ectothermic, cold, blooded, the, surrounding, temperature, plays, an, important, role, in, the, digestion, process, the, ideal, temperature, for, snakes, to, digest, food, is, 30, c, 86, f, there, is, a, huge, amount, of, metabolic, energy, involved, in, a, snake, s, digestion, for, example, the, surface, body, temperature, of, the, south, american, rattlesnake, crotalus, durissus, increases, by, as, much, as, 1, 2, c, 2, 2, f, during, the, digestive, process, if, a, snake, is, disturbed, after, having, eaten, recently, it, will, often, regurgitate, its, prey, to, be, able, to, escape, the, perceived, threat, when, undisturbed, the, digestive, process, is, highly, efficient, the, snake, s, digestive, enzymes, dissolve, and, absorb, everything, but, the, prey, s, hair, or, feathers, and, claws, which, are, excreted, along, with, waste, hooding, expansion, of, the, neck, area, is, a, visual, deterrent, mostly, seen, in, cobras, elapids, and, is, primarily, controlled, by, rib, muscles, hooding, can, be, accompanied, by, spitting, venom, towards, the, threatening, object, and, producing, a, specialized, sound, hissing, studies, on, captive, cobras, showed, that, 13, 22, of, the, body, length, is, raised, during, hooding, the, lack, of, limbs, does, not, impede, the, movement, of, snakes, they, have, developed, several, different, modes, of, locomotion, to, deal, with, particular, environments, unlike, the, gaits, of, limbed, animals, which, form, a, continuum, each, mode, of, snake, locomotion, is, discrete, and, distinct, from, the, others, transitions, between, modes, are, abrupt, lateral, undulation, is, the, sole, mode, of, aquatic, locomotion, and, the, most, common, mode, of, terrestrial, locomotion, in, this, mode, the, body, of, the, snake, alternately, flexes, to, the, left, and, right, resulting, in, a, series, of, rearward, moving, waves, while, this, movement, appears, rapid, snakes, have, rarely, been, documented, moving, faster, than, two, body, lengths, per, second, often, much, less, this, mode, of, movement, has, the, same, net, cost, of, transport, calories, burned, per, meter, moved, as, running, in, lizards, of, the, same, mass, terrestrial, lateral, undulation, is, the, most, common, mode, of, terrestrial, locomotion, for, most, snake, species, in, this, mode, the, posteriorly, moving, waves, push, against, contact, points, in, the, environment, such, as, rocks, twigs, irregularities, in, the, soil, etc, each, of, these, environmental, objects, in, turn, generates, a, reaction, force, directed, forward, and, towards, the, midline, of, the, snake, resulting, in, forward, thrust, while, the, lateral, components, cancel, out, the, speed, of, this, movement, depends, upon, the, density, of, push, points, in, the, environment, with, a, medium, density, of, about, 8, along, the, snake, s, length, being, ideal, the, wave, speed, is, precisely, the, same, as, the, snake, speed, and, as, a, result, every, point, on, the, snake, s, body, follows, the, path, of, the, point, ahead, of, it, allowing, snakes, to, move, through, very, dense, vegetation, and, small, openings, when, swimming, the, waves, become, larger, as, they, move, down, the, snake, s, body, and, the, wave, travels, backwards, faster, than, the, snake, moves, forwards, thrust, is, generated, by, pushing, their, body, against, the, water, resulting, in, the, observed, slip, in, spite, of, overall, similarities, studies, show, that, the, pattern, of, muscle, activation, is, different, in, aquatic, versus, terrestrial, lateral, undulation, which, justifies, calling, them, separate, modes, all, snakes, can, laterally, undulate, forward, with, backward, moving, waves, but, only, sea, snakes, have, been, observed, reversing, the, motion, moving, backwards, with, forward, moving, waves, most, often, employed, by, colubroid, snakes, colubrids, elapids, and, vipers, when, the, snake, must, move, in, an, environment, that, lacks, irregularities, to, push, against, rendering, lateral, undulation, impossible, such, as, a, slick, mud, flat, or, a, sand, dune, sidewinding, is, a, modified, form, of, lateral, undulation, in, which, all, of, the, body, segments, oriented, in, one, direction, remain, in, contact, with, the, ground, while, the, other, segments, are, lifted, up, resulting, in, a, peculiar, rolling, motion, the, sidewinder, moves, forward, by, throwing, a, loop, of, itself, and, then, pulling, itself, up, by, it, by, lowering, its, head, the, snake, gets, leverage, straightening, itself, out, and, pressing, itself, against, the, ground, it, brings, itself, forward, and, at, an, angle, that, leaves, it, ready, for, the, next, jump, the, head, and, the, loop, are, in, effect, the, two, feet, upon, which, the, snake, walks, the, snake, s, body, appearing, roughly, perpendicular, to, its, direction, may, bewilder, the, observer, since, preconception, may, lead, one, to, associate, snake, movement, with, a, head, that, leads, and, a, body, that, follows, it, appears, the, sidewinder, is, going, sideways, but, precisely, where, the, snake, is, going, where, it, wants, to, go, the, head, gives, clear, indication, the, snake, leaves, behind, a, trail, that, looks, like, a, series, of, hooks, one, after, the, next, snakes, can, move, backwards, to, retreat, from, an, enemy, though, they, normally, do, not, this, mode, of, locomotion, overcomes, the, slippery, nature, of, sand, or, mud, by, pushing, off, with, only, static, portions, on, the, body, thereby, minimizing, slipping, the, static, nature, of, the, contact, points, can, be, shown, from, the, tracks, of, a, sidewinding, snake, which, show, each, belly, scale, imprint, without, any, smearing, this, mode, of, locomotion, has, very, low, caloric, cost, less, than, 1, 3, of, the, cost, for, a, lizard, to, move, the, same, distance, contrary, to, popular, belief, there, is, no, evidence, that, sidewinding, is, associated, with, the, sand, being, hot, when, push, points, are, absent, but, there, is, not, enough, space, to, use, sidewinding, because, of, lateral, constraints, such, as, in, tunnels, snakes, rely, on, concertina, locomotion, in, this, mode, the, snake, braces, the, posterior, portion, of, its, body, against, the, tunnel, wall, while, the, front, of, the, snake, extends, and, straightens, the, front, portion, then, flexes, and, forms, an, anchor, point, and, the, posterior, is, straightened, and, pulled, forwards, this, mode, of, locomotion, is, slow, and, very, demanding, up, to, seven, times, the, cost, of, laterally, undulating, over, the, same, distance, this, high, cost, is, due, to, the, repeated, stops, and, starts, of, portions, of, the, body, as, well, as, the, necessity, of, using, active, muscular, effort, to, brace, against, the, tunnel, walls, the, movement, of, snakes, in, arboreal, habitats, has, only, recently, been, studied, while, on, tree, branches, snakes, use, several, modes, of, locomotion, depending, on, species, and, bark, texture, in, general, snakes, will, use, a, modified, form, of, concertina, locomotion, on, smooth, branches, but, will, laterally, undulate, if, contact, points, are, available, snakes, move, faster, on, small, branches, and, when, contact, points, are, present, in, contrast, to, limbed, animals, which, do, better, on, large, branches, with, little, clutter, gliding, snakes, chrysopelea, of, southeast, asia, launch, themselves, from, branch, tips, spreading, their, ribs, and, laterally, undulating, as, they, glide, between, trees, these, snakes, can, perform, a, controlled, glide, for, hundreds, of, feet, depending, upon, launch, altitude, and, can, even, turn, in, midair, the, slowest, mode, of, snake, locomotion, is, rectilinear, locomotion, which, is, also, the, only, one, where, the, snake, does, not, need, to, bend, its, body, laterally, though, it, may, do, so, when, turning, in, this,
