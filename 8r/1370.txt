a, bone, fracture, abbreviated, frx, or, fx, f, x, or, is, a, medical, condition, in, which, there, is, a, partial, or, complete, break, in, the, continuity, of, any, bone, in, the, body, in, more, severe, cases, the, bone, may, be, broken, into, several, fragments, known, as, a, comminuted, fracture, a, bone, fracture, may, be, the, result, of, high, force, impact, or, stress, or, a, minimal, trauma, injury, as, a, result, of, certain, medical, conditions, that, weaken, the, bones, such, as, osteoporosis, osteopenia, bone, cancer, or, osteogenesis, imperfecta, where, the, fracture, is, then, properly, termed, a, pathologic, fracture, although, bone, tissue, contains, no, pain, receptors, a, bone, fracture, is, painful, for, several, reasons, damage, to, adjacent, structures, such, as, nerves, muscles, or, blood, vessels, spinal, cord, and, nerve, roots, for, spine, fractures, or, cranial, contents, for, skull, fractures, may, cause, other, specific, signs, and, symptoms, some, fractures, may, lead, to, serious, complications, including, a, condition, known, as, compartment, syndrome, if, not, treated, eventually, compartment, syndrome, may, require, amputation, of, the, affected, limb, other, complications, may, include, non, union, where, the, fractured, bone, fails, to, heal, or, malunion, where, the, fractured, bone, heals, in, a, deformed, manner, one, form, of, malunion, is, the, malrotation, of, a, bone, which, is, especially, common, after, femoral, and, tibial, fractures, complications, of, fractures, may, be, classified, into, three, broad, groups, depending, upon, their, time, of, occurrence, these, are, as, follows, the, natural, process, of, healing, a, fracture, starts, when, the, injured, bone, and, surrounding, tissues, bleed, forming, a, fracture, hematoma, the, blood, coagulates, to, form, a, blood, clot, situated, between, the, broken, fragments, within, a, few, days, blood, vessels, grow, into, the, jelly, like, matrix, of, the, blood, clot, the, new, blood, vessels, bring, phagocytes, to, the, area, which, gradually, removes, the, non, viable, material, the, blood, vessels, also, bring, fibroblasts, in, the, walls, of, the, vessels, and, these, multiply, and, produce, collagen, fibres, in, this, way, the, blood, clot, is, replaced, by, a, matrix, of, collagen, collagen, s, rubbery, consistency, allows, bone, fragments, to, move, only, a, small, amount, unless, severe, or, persistent, force, is, applied, at, this, stage, some, of, the, fibroblasts, begin, to, lay, down, bone, matrix, in, the, form, of, collagen, monomers, these, monomers, spontaneously, assemble, to, form, the, bone, matrix, for, which, bone, crystals, calcium, hydroxyapatite, are, deposited, in, amongst, in, the, form, of, insoluble, crystals, this, mineralization, of, the, collagen, matrix, stiffens, it, and, transforms, it, into, bone, in, fact, bone, is, a, mineralized, collagen, matrix, if, the, mineral, is, dissolved, out, of, bone, it, becomes, rubbery, healing, bone, callus, on, average, is, sufficiently, mineralized, to, show, up, on, x, ray, within, 6, weeks, in, adults, and, less, in, children, this, initial, woven, bone, does, not, have, the, strong, mechanical, properties, of, mature, bone, by, a, process, of, remodelling, the, woven, bone, is, replaced, by, mature, lamellar, bone, the, whole, process, may, take, up, to, 18, months, but, in, adults, the, strength, of, the, healing, bone, is, usually, 80, of, normal, by, 3, months, after, the, injury, several, factors, may, help, or, hinder, the, bone, healing, process, for, example, tobacco, smoking, hinders, the, process, of, bone, healing, and, adequate, nutrition, including, calcium, intake, will, help, the, bone, healing, process, weight, bearing, stress, on, bone, after, the, bone, has, healed, sufficiently, to, bear, the, weight, also, builds, bone, strength, although, there, are, theoretical, concerns, about, nsaids, slowing, the, rate, of, healing, there, is, not, enough, evidence, to, warrant, withholding, the, use, of, this, type, analgesic, in, simple, fractures, smokers, generally, have, lower, bone, density, than, non, smokers, so, they, have, a, much, higher, risk, of, fractures, there, is, also, evidence, that, smoking, delays, bone, healing, a, bone, fracture, may, be, diagnosed, based, on, the, history, given, and, the, physical, examination, performed, radiographic, imaging, often, is, performed, to, confirm, the, diagnosis, under, certain, circumstances, radiographic, examination, of, the, nearby, joints, is, indicated, in, order, to, exclude, dislocations, and, fracture, dislocations, in, situations, where, projectional, radiography, alone, is, insufficient, computed, tomography, ct, or, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, may, be, indicated, in, orthopedic, medicine, fractures, are, classified, in, various, ways, historically, they, are, named, after, the, physician, who, first, described, the, fracture, conditions, however, there, are, more, systematic, classifications, as, well, they, may, be, divided, into, stable, versus, unstable, depending, on, the, likelihood, that, they, may, shift, further, an, anatomical, classification, may, begin, with, specifying, the, involved, body, part, such, as, the, head, or, arm, followed, by, more, specific, localization, fractures, that, have, additional, definition, criteria, than, merely, localization, often, may, be, classified, as, subtypes, of, fractures, such, as, a, holstein, lewis, fracture, being, a, subtype, of, a, humerus, fracture, most, typical, examples, in, an, orthopaedic, classification, given, in, the, previous, section, cannot, be, classified, appropriately, into, any, specific, part, of, an, anatomical, classification, however, as, they, may, apply, to, multiple, anatomical, fracture, sites, the, orthopaedic, trauma, association, committee, for, coding, and, classification, published, its, classification, system, in, 1996, adopting, a, similar, system, to, the, 1987, ao, foundation, system, in, 2007, they, extended, their, system, unifying, the, two, systems, regarding, wrist, hand, foot, and, ankle, fractures, a, number, of, classifications, are, named, after, the, person, eponymous, who, developed, it, both, high, and, low, force, trauma, can, cause, bone, fracture, injuries, preventive, efforts, to, reduce, motor, vehicle, crashes, the, most, common, cause, of, high, force, trauma, include, reducing, distractions, while, driving, common, distractions, are, driving, under, the, influence, and, texting, or, calling, while, driving, both, of, which, lead, to, an, approximate, 6, fold, increase, in, crashes, wearing, a, seatbelt, can, also, reduce, the, likelihood, of, injury, in, a, collision, 30, km, h, or, 20, mph, speed, limits, as, opposed, to, the, more, common, intracity, 50, km, h, 30, mph, also, drastically, reduce, the, risk, of, accident, serious, injury, and, even, death, in, crashes, between, motor, vehicles, and, humans, vision, zero, aims, to, reduce, traffic, deaths, to, zero, through, better, traffic, design, and, other, measures, and, to, drastically, reduce, traffic, injuries, which, would, prevent, many, bone, fractures, a, common, cause, of, low, force, trauma, is, an, at, home, fall, when, considering, preventative, efforts, the, national, institute, of, health, nih, examines, ways, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, falling, the, force, of, the, fall, and, bone, fragility, to, prevent, at, home, falls, they, suggest, keeping, cords, out, of, high, traffic, areas, where, someone, could, trip, installing, handrails, and, keeping, stairways, well, lit, and, installing, an, assistive, bar, near, the, bathtub, in, the, washroom, for, support, to, reduce, the, impact, of, a, fall, the, nih, recommends, to, try, falling, straight, down, on, your, buttocks, or, onto, your, hands, some, sports, have, a, relatively, high, risk, of, bone, fractures, as, a, common, sports, injury, preventive, measures, depend, to, some, extent, on, the, specific, sport, but, learning, proper, technique, wearing, protective, gear, and, having, a, realistic, estimation, of, one, s, own, capabilities, and, limitations, can, all, help, reduce, the, risk, of, bone, fracture, in, contact, sports, rules, have, been, put, in, place, to, protect, athlete, health, such, as, the, prohibition, of, unnecessary, roughness, in, american, football, taking, calcium, and, vitamin, d, supplements, can, help, strengthen, your, bones, vitamin, d, supplements, combined, with, additional, calcium, marginally, reduces, the, risk, of, hip, fractures, and, other, types, of, fracture, in, older, adults, however, vitamin, d, supplementation, alone, did, not, reduce, the, risk, of, fractures, treatment, of, bone, fractures, are, broadly, classified, as, surgical, or, conservative, the, latter, basically, referring, to, any, non, surgical, procedure, such, as, pain, management, immobilization, or, other, non, surgical, stabilization, a, similar, classification, is, open, versus, closed, treatment, in, which, open, treatment, refers, to, any, treatment, in, which, the, fracture, site, is, opened, surgically, regardless, of, whether, the, fracture, is, an, open, or, closed, fracture, in, arm, fractures, in, children, ibuprofen, has, been, found, to, be, as, effective, as, a, combination, of, paracetamol, and, codeine, in, the, ems, setting, it, might, be, applicable, to, administer, 1mg, kg, of, iv, ketamine, to, achieve, a, dissociated, state, since, bone, healing, is, a, natural, process, that, will, occur, most, often, fracture, treatment, aims, to, ensure, the, best, possible, function, of, the, injured, part, after, healing, bone, fractures, typically, are, treated, by, restoring, the, fractured, pieces, of, bone, to, their, natural, positions, if, necessary, and, maintaining, those, positions, while, the, bone, heals, often, aligning, the, bone, called, reduction, in, a, good, position, and, verifying, the, improved, alignment, with, an, x, ray, is, all, that, is, needed, this, process, is, extremely, painful, without, anaesthesia, about, as, painful, as, breaking, the, bone, itself, to, this, end, a, fractured, limb, usually, is, immobilized, with, a, plaster, or, fibreglass, cast, or, splint, that, holds, the, bones, in, position, and, immobilizes, the, joints, above, and, below, the, fracture, when, the, initial, post, fracture, oedema, or, swelling, goes, down, the, fracture, may, be, placed, in, a, removable, brace, or, orthosis, if, being, treated, with, surgery, surgical, nails, screws, plates, and, wires, are, used, to, hold, the, fractured, bone, together, more, directly, alternatively, fractured, bones, may, be, treated, by, the, ilizarov, method, which, is, a, form, of, an, external, fixator, occasionally, smaller, bones, such, as, phalanges, of, the, toes, and, fingers, may, be, treated, without, the, cast, by, buddy, wrapping, them, which, serves, a, similar, function, to, making, a, cast, a, device, called, a, suzuki, frame, may, be, used, in, cases, of, deep, complex, intra, articular, digit, fractures, by, allowing, only, limited, movement, immobilization, helps, preserve, anatomical, alignment, while, enabling, callus, formation, toward, the, target, of, achieving, union, splinting, results, in, the, same, outcome, as, casting, in, children, who, have, a, distal, radius, fracture, with, little, shifting, surgical, methods, of, treating, fractures, have, their, own, risks, and, benefits, but, usually, surgery, is, performed, only, if, conservative, treatment, has, failed, is, very, likely, to, fail, or, is, likely, to, result, in, a, poor, functional, outcome, with, some, fractures, such, as, hip, fractures, usually, caused, by, osteoporosis, surgery, is, offered, routinely, because, non, operative, treatment, results, in, prolonged, immobilisation, which, commonly, results, in, complications, including, chest, infections, pressure, sores, deconditioning, deep, vein, thrombosis, dvt, and, pulmonary, embolism, which, are, more, dangerous, than, surgery, when, a, joint, surface, is, damaged, by, a, fracture, surgery, is, also, commonly, recommended, to, make, an, accurate, anatomical, reduction, and, restore, the, smoothness, of, the, joint, infection, is, especially, dangerous, in, bones, due, to, the, recrudescent, nature, of, bone, infections, bone, tissue, is, predominantly, extracellular, matrix, rather, than, living, cells, and, the, few, blood, vessels, needed, to, support, this, low, metabolism, are, only, able, to, bring, a, limited, number, of, immune, cells, to, an, injury, to, fight, infection, for, this, reason, open, fractures, and, osteotomies, call, for, very, careful, antiseptic, procedures, and, prophylactic, use, of, antibiotics, occasionally, bone, grafting, is, used, to, treat, a, fracture, sometimes, bones, are, reinforced, with, metal, these, implants, must, be, designed, and, installed, with, care, stress, shielding, occurs, when, plates, or, screws, carry, too, large, of, a, portion, of, the, bone, s, load, causing, atrophy, this, problem, is, reduced, but, not, eliminated, by, the, use, of, low, modulus, materials, including, titanium, and, its, alloys, the, heat, generated, by, the, friction, of, installing, hardware, can, accumulate, easily, and, damage, bone, tissue, reducing, the, strength, of, the, connections, if, dissimilar, metals, are, installed, in, contact, with, one, another, i, e, a, titanium, plate, with, cobalt, chromium, alloy, or, stainless, steel, screws, galvanic, corrosion, will, result, the, metal, ions, produced, can, damage, the, bone, locally, and, may, cause, systemic, effects, as, well, bone, stimulation, with, either, electromagnetic, or, ultrasound, waves, may, be, suggested, as, an, alternative, to, surgery, to, reduce, the, healing, time, for, non, union, fractures, the, proposed, mechanism, of, action, is, by, stimulating, osteoblasts, and, other, proteins, that, form, bones, using, these, modalities, the, evidence, supporting, the, use, of, ultrasound, and, shockwave, therapy, for, improving, unions, is, very, weak, and, it, is, likely, that, these, approaches, do, not, make, a, clinically, significant, difference, for, a, delayed, union, or, non, union, physical, therapy, exercises, either, home, based, or, physiotherapist, led, to, improve, functional, mobility, and, strength, gait, training, for, hip, fractures, and, other, physical, exercise, are, also, often, suggested, to, help, recover, physical, capacities, after, a, fracture, has, healed, in, children, whose, bones, are, still, developing, there, are, risks, of, either, a, growth, plate, injury, or, a, greenstick, fracture
