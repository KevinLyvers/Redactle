blunt, trauma, also, known, as, blunt, force, trauma, or, non, penetrating, trauma, describes, a, physical, trauma, due, to, a, forceful, impact, without, penetration, of, the, body, s, surface, blunt, trauma, stands, in, contrast, with, penetrating, trauma, which, occurs, when, an, object, pierces, the, skin, enters, body, tissue, and, creates, an, open, wound, blunt, trauma, occurs, due, to, direct, physical, trauma, or, impactful, force, to, a, body, part, such, incidents, often, occur, with, road, traffic, collisions, assaults, and, sports, related, injuries, and, are, notably, common, among, the, elderly, who, experience, falls, blunt, trauma, can, lead, to, a, wide, range, of, injuries, including, contusions, concussions, abrasions, lacerations, internal, or, external, hemorrhages, and, bone, fractures, the, severity, of, these, injuries, depends, on, factors, such, as, the, force, of, the, impact, the, area, of, the, body, affected, and, the, underlying, comorbidities, of, the, affected, individual, in, some, cases, blunt, force, trauma, can, be, life, threatening, and, may, require, immediate, medical, attention, blunt, trauma, to, the, head, and, or, severe, blood, loss, are, the, most, likely, causes, of, death, due, to, blunt, force, traumatic, injury, blunt, abdominal, trauma, bat, represents, 75, of, all, blunt, trauma, and, is, the, most, common, example, of, this, injury, seventy, five, percent, of, bat, occurs, in, motor, vehicle, crashes, in, which, rapid, deceleration, may, propel, the, driver, into, the, steering, wheel, dashboard, or, seatbelt, causing, contusions, in, less, serious, cases, or, rupture, of, internal, organs, from, briefly, increased, intraluminal, pressure, in, the, more, serious, depending, on, the, force, applied, initially, there, may, be, few, indications, that, serious, internal, abdominal, injury, has, occurred, making, assessment, more, challenging, and, requiring, a, high, degree, of, clinical, suspicion, there, are, two, basic, physical, mechanisms, at, play, with, the, potential, of, injury, to, intra, abdominal, organs, compression, and, deceleration, the, former, occurs, from, a, direct, blow, such, as, a, punch, or, compression, against, a, non, yielding, object, such, as, a, seat, belt, or, steering, column, this, force, may, deform, a, hollow, organ, increasing, its, intraluminal, or, internal, pressure, and, possibly, leading, to, rupture, deceleration, on, the, other, hand, causes, stretching, and, shearing, at, the, points, where, mobile, contents, in, the, abdomen, like, the, bowel, are, anchored, this, can, cause, tearing, of, the, mesentery, of, the, bowel, and, injury, to, the, blood, vessels, that, travel, within, the, mesentery, classic, examples, of, these, mechanisms, are, a, hepatic, tear, along, the, ligamentum, teres, and, injuries, to, the, renal, arteries, when, blunt, abdominal, trauma, is, complicated, by, internal, injury, the, liver, and, spleen, see, blunt, splenic, trauma, are, most, frequently, involved, followed, by, the, small, intestine, in, rare, cases, this, injury, has, been, attributed, to, medical, techniques, such, as, the, heimlich, maneuver, attempts, at, cpr, and, manual, thrusts, to, clear, an, airway, although, these, are, rare, examples, it, has, been, suggested, that, they, are, caused, by, applying, excessive, pressure, when, performing, these, life, saving, techniques, finally, the, occurrence, of, splenic, rupture, with, mild, blunt, abdominal, trauma, in, those, recovering, from, infectious, mononucleosis, or, mono, also, known, as, glandular, fever, in, non, u, s, countries, specifically, the, uk, is, well, reported, the, supervised, environment, in, which, most, sports, injuries, occur, allows, for, mild, deviations, from, the, traditional, trauma, treatment, algorithms, such, as, atls, due, to, the, greater, precision, in, identifying, the, mechanism, of, injury, the, priority, in, assessing, blunt, trauma, in, sports, injuries, is, separating, contusions, and, musculo, tendinous, injuries, from, injuries, to, solid, organs, and, the, gut, it, is, also, crucial, to, recognize, the, potential, for, developing, blood, loss, and, to, react, accordingly, blunt, injuries, to, the, kidney, from, helmets, shoulder, pads, and, knees, are, described, in, american, football, association, football, martial, arts, and, all, terrain, vehicle, crashes, the, term, blunt, thoracic, trauma, or, more, informally, blunt, chest, injury, encompasses, a, variety, of, injuries, to, the, chest, broadly, this, also, includes, damage, caused, by, direct, blunt, force, such, as, a, fist, or, a, bat, in, an, assault, acceleration, or, deceleration, such, as, that, from, a, rear, end, automotive, crash, shear, force, a, combination, of, acceleration, and, deceleration, compression, such, as, a, heavy, object, falling, on, a, person, and, blasts, such, as, an, explosion, of, some, sort, common, signs, and, symptoms, include, something, as, simple, as, bruising, but, occasionally, as, complicated, as, hypoxia, ventilation, perfusion, mismatch, hypovolemia, and, reduced, cardiac, output, due, to, the, way, the, thoracic, organs, may, have, been, affected, blunt, thoracic, trauma, is, not, always, visible, from, the, outside, and, such, internal, injuries, may, not, show, signs, or, symptoms, at, the, time, the, trauma, initially, occurs, or, even, until, hours, after, a, high, degree, of, clinical, suspicion, may, sometimes, be, required, to, identify, such, injuries, a, ct, scan, may, prove, useful, in, such, instances, those, experiencing, more, obvious, complications, from, a, blunt, chest, injury, will, likely, undergo, a, focused, assessment, with, sonography, for, trauma, fast, which, can, reliably, detect, a, significant, amount, of, blood, around, the, heart, or, in, the, lung, by, using, a, special, machine, that, visualizes, sound, waves, sent, through, the, body, only, 10, 15, of, thoracic, traumas, require, surgery, but, they, can, have, serious, impacts, on, the, heart, lungs, and, great, vessels, the, most, immediate, life, threatening, injuries, that, may, occur, include, tension, pneumothorax, open, pneumothorax, hemothorax, flail, chest, cardiac, tamponade, and, airway, obstruction, rupture, the, injuries, may, necessitate, a, procedure, most, commonly, the, insertion, of, an, intercostal, drain, or, chest, tube, this, tube, is, typically, installed, because, it, helps, restore, a, certain, balance, in, pressures, usually, due, to, misplaced, air, or, surrounding, blood, that, are, impeding, the, lungs, ability, to, inflate, and, thus, exchange, vital, gases, that, allow, the, body, to, function, a, less, common, procedure, that, may, be, employed, is, a, pericardiocentesis, which, by, removing, blood, surrounding, the, heart, permits, the, heart, to, regain, some, ability, to, appropriately, pump, blood, in, certain, dire, circumstances, an, emergent, thoracotomy, may, be, employed, the, primary, clinical, concern, with, blunt, trauma, to, the, head, is, damage, to, the, brain, although, other, structures, including, the, skull, face, orbits, and, neck, are, also, at, risk, following, assessment, of, the, patient, s, airway, circulation, and, breathing, a, cervical, collar, may, be, placed, if, there, is, suspicion, of, trauma, to, the, neck, evaluation, of, blunt, trauma, to, the, head, continues, with, the, secondary, survey, for, evidence, of, cranial, trauma, including, bruises, contusions, lacerations, and, abrasions, in, addition, to, noting, external, injury, a, comprehensive, neurologic, exam, is, typically, performed, to, assess, for, damage, to, the, brain, depending, on, the, mechanism, of, injury, and, examination, a, ct, scan, of, the, skull, and, brain, may, be, ordered, this, is, typically, done, to, assess, for, blood, within, the, skull, or, fracture, of, the, skull, bones, traumatic, brain, injury, tbi, is, a, significant, cause, of, morbidity, and, mortality, and, is, most, commonly, caused, by, falls, motor, vehicle, crashes, sports, and, work, related, injuries, and, assaults, it, is, the, most, common, cause, of, death, in, patients, under, the, age, of, 25, tbi, is, graded, from, mild, to, severe, with, greater, severity, correlating, with, increased, morbidity, and, mortality, most, patients, with, more, severe, traumatic, brain, injury, have, a, combination, of, intracranial, injuries, which, can, include, diffuse, axonal, injury, cerebral, contusions, and, intracranial, bleeding, including, subarachnoid, hemorrhage, subdural, hematoma, epidural, hematoma, and, intraparenchymal, hemorrhage, the, recovery, of, brain, function, following, a, traumatic, injury, is, highly, variable, and, depends, upon, the, specific, intracranial, injuries, that, occur, however, there, is, a, significant, correlation, between, the, severity, of, the, initial, insult, as, well, as, the, level, of, neurologic, function, during, the, initial, assessment, and, the, level, of, lasting, neurologic, deficits, initial, treatment, may, be, targeted, at, reducing, the, intracranial, pressure, if, there, is, concern, for, swelling, or, bleeding, within, this, skull, this, may, require, surgery, such, as, a, hemicraniectomy, in, which, part, of, the, skull, is, removed, injury, to, extremities, like, arms, legs, hands, feet, is, extremely, common, falls, are, the, most, common, etiology, making, up, as, much, as, 30, of, upper, and, 60, of, lower, extremity, injuries, the, most, common, mechanism, for, solely, upper, extremity, injuries, is, machine, operation, or, tool, use, work, related, accidents, and, vehicle, crashes, are, also, common, causes, the, injured, extremity, is, examined, for, four, major, functional, components, which, include, soft, tissues, nerves, vessels, and, bones, vessels, are, examined, for, expanding, hematoma, bruit, distal, pulse, exam, and, signs, symptoms, of, ischemia, essentially, asking, does, blood, seem, to, be, getting, through, the, injured, area, in, a, way, that, enough, is, getting, to, the, parts, past, the, injury, when, it, is, not, obvious, that, the, answer, is, yes, an, injured, extremity, index, or, ankle, brachial, index, may, be, used, to, help, guide, whether, further, evaluation, with, computed, tomography, arteriography, this, uses, a, special, scanner, and, a, substance, that, makes, it, easier, to, examine, the, vessels, in, finer, detail, than, what, the, human, hand, can, feel, or, the, human, eye, can, see, soft, tissue, damage, can, lead, to, rhabdomyolysis, a, rapid, breakdown, of, injured, muscle, that, can, overwhelm, the, kidneys, or, may, potentially, develop, compartment, syndrome, when, pressure, builds, up, in, muscle, compartments, damages, the, nerves, and, vessels, in, the, same, compartment, bones, are, evaluated, with, plain, film, x, ray, or, computed, tomography, if, deformity, misshapen, bruising, or, joint, laxity, looser, or, more, flexible, than, usual, are, observed, neurologic, evaluation, involves, testing, the, major, nerve, functions, of, the, axillary, radial, and, median, nerves, in, the, upper, extremity, as, well, as, the, femoral, sciatic, deep, peroneal, and, tibial, nerves, in, the, lower, extremity, depending, on, the, extent, of, injury, and, involved, structures, surgical, treatment, may, be, necessary, but, many, are, managed, nonoperatively, the, most, common, causes, of, blunt, pelvic, trauma, are, motor, vehicle, crashes, and, multiple, story, falls, and, thus, pelvic, injuries, are, commonly, associated, with, additional, traumatic, injuries, in, other, locations, in, the, pelvis, specifically, the, structures, at, risk, include, the, pelvic, bones, the, proximal, femur, major, blood, vessels, such, as, the, iliac, arteries, the, urinary, tract, reproductive, organs, and, the, rectum, one, of, the, primary, concerns, is, the, risk, of, pelvic, fracture, which, itself, is, associated, with, a, myriad, of, complications, including, bleeding, damage, to, the, urethra, and, bladder, and, nerve, damage, if, pelvic, trauma, is, suspected, emergency, medical, services, personnel, may, place, a, pelvic, binder, on, patients, to, stabilize, the, patient, s, pelvis, and, prevent, further, damage, to, these, structures, while, patients, are, transported, to, a, hospital, during, the, evaluation, of, trauma, patients, in, an, emergency, department, the, stability, of, the, pelvis, is, typically, assessed, by, the, healthcare, provider, to, determine, whether, a, fracture, may, have, occurred, providers, may, then, decide, to, order, imaging, such, as, an, x, ray, or, ct, scan, to, detect, fractures, however, if, there, is, concern, for, life, threatening, bleeding, patients, should, receive, an, x, ray, of, the, pelvis, following, initial, treatment, of, the, patient, fractures, may, need, to, be, treated, surgically, if, significant, while, some, minor, fractures, may, heal, without, requiring, surgery, a, life, threatening, concern, is, hemorrhage, which, may, result, from, damage, to, the, aorta, iliac, arteries, or, veins, in, the, pelvis, the, majority, of, bleeding, due, to, pelvic, trauma, is, due, to, injury, to, the, veins, fluid, often, blood, may, be, detected, in, the, pelvis, via, ultrasound, during, the, fast, scan, that, is, often, performed, following, traumatic, injuries, should, a, patient, appear, hemodynamically, unstable, in, the, absence, of, obvious, blood, on, the, fast, scan, there, may, be, concern, for, bleeding, into, the, retroperitoneal, space, known, as, retroperitoneal, hematoma, stopping, the, bleeding, may, require, endovascular, intervention, or, surgery, depending, on, the, location, and, severity, blunt, cardiac, trauma, also, known, as, blunt, cardiac, injury, bci, encompasses, a, spectrum, of, cardiac, injuries, resulting, from, blunt, force, trauma, to, the, chest, while, bcis, necessitate, a, substantial, amount, of, force, to, occur, because, the, heart, is, well, protected, by, the, rib, cage, and, sternum, the, majority, of, patients, are, asymptomatic, clinical, presentations, may, range, from, minor, clinically, insignificant, changes, to, heartbeat, or, may, progress, to, severe, cardiac, failure, and, death, oftentimes, chest, wall, injuries, are, seen, in, conjunction, with, bci, which, confounds, the, presence, of, chest, pain, experienced, by, most, patients, to, evaluate, the, spectrum, of, cardiac, injury, the, american, association, for, the, surgery, of, trauma, aast, organ, injury, scale, may, be, used, to, aid, in, determining, the, extent, of, the, injury, see, evaluation, and, diagnosis, below, bci, may, be, broken, down, into, pericardial, injury, valvular, injuries, coronary, artery, injuries, cardiac, chamber, rupture, and, myocardial, contusion, in, most, settings, the, initial, evaluation, and, stabilization, of, traumatic, injury, follows, the, same, general, principles, of, identifying, and, treating, immediately, life, threatening, injuries, in, the, us, the, american, college, of, surgeons, publishes, the, advanced, trauma, life, support, guidelines, which, provide, a, step, by, step, approach, to, the, initial, assessment, stabilization, diagnostic, reasoning, and, treatment, of, traumatic, injuries, that, codifies, this, general, principle, the, assessment, typically, begins, by, ensuring, that, the, subject, s, airway, is, open, and, competent, that, breathing, is, unlabored, and, that, circulation, i, e, pulses, that, can, be, felt, is, present, this, is, sometimes, described, as, the, a, b, c, s, airway, breathing, and, circulation, and, is, the, first, step, in, any, resuscitation, or, triage, then, the, history, of, the, accident, or, injury, is, amplified, with, any, medical, dietary, timing, of, last, oral, intake, and, history, from, whatever, sources, that, might, be, available, such, as, family, friends, and, previous, treating, physicians, this, method, is, sometimes, given, the, mnemonic, sample, the, amount, of, time, spent, on, diagnosis, should, be, minimized, and, expedited, by, a, combination, of, clinical, assessment, and, appropriate, use, of, technology, such, as, diagnostic, peritoneal, lavage, dpl, or, bedside, ultrasound, examination, fast, before, proceeding, to, laparotomy, if, required, if, time, and, the, patient, s, stability, permit, a, ct, examination, may, be, carried, out, if, available, its, advantages, include, superior, definition, of, the, injury, leading, to, grading, of, the, injury, and, sometimes, the, confidence, to, avoid, or, postpone, surgery, its, disadvantages, include, the, time, taken, to, acquire, images, although, this, gets, shorter, with, each, generation, of, scanners, and, the, removal, of, the, patient, from, the, immediate, view, of, the, emergency, or, surgical, staff, many, providers, use, the, aid, of, an, algorithm, such, as, the, atls, guidelines, to, determine, which, images, to, obtain, following, the, initial, assessment, these, algorithms, take, into, account, the, mechanism, of, injury, physical, examination, and, patient, s, vital, signs, to, determine, whether, patients, should, have, imaging, or, proceed, directly, to, surgery, in, 2011, criteria, were, defined, that, might, allow, patients, with, blunt, abdominal, trauma, to, be, discharged, safely, without, further, evaluation, the, characteristics, of, such, patients, include, to, be, considered, low, risk, patients, would, need, to, meet, all, low, risk, criteria, when, blunt, trauma, is, significant, enough, to, require, evaluation, by, a, healthcare, provider, treatment, is, typically, aimed, at, treating, life, threatening, injuries, such, as, maintaining, the, patient, s, airway, and, preventing, ongoing, blood, loss, patients, who, have, suffered, blunt, trauma, and, meet, specific, triage, criteria, have, shown, improved, outcomes, when, they, are, cared, for, in, a, trauma, center, the, management, of, patients, with, blunt, force, trauma, necessitates, the, collaboration, of, an, interpersonal, healthcare, team, which, may, include, but, is, not, limited, to, a, trauma, surgeon, emergency, department, physician, anesthesiologist, and, emergency, and, trauma, nursing, staff, in, cases, of, blunt, abdominal, injury, the, most, frequent, damage, occurs, in, the, small, intestines, and, in, severe, situations, this, can, result, in, small, intestine, perforation, perforation, of, the, small, or, large, intestines, is, a, serious, concern, due, to, its, tremendous, infectious, potential, in, these, cases, it, is, essential, to, perform, exploratory, surgery, to, assess, the, internal, damage, drain, infected, fluid, in, the, abdomen, and, clean, the, wound, with, saline, prophylactic, antibiotics, are, often, necessary, in, the, case, of, multiple, holes, or, significant, damage, to, the, blood, supply, of, the, intestines, the, affected, segment, of, tissue, may, need, to, be, removed, entirely, the, treatment, of, blunt, cranial, trauma, is, dependent, on, the, extent, of, the, injury, a, discussion, between, the, patient, and, healthcare, professionals, will, take, place, in, order, to, carefully, assess, the, patient, s, condition, and, determine, the, best, approach, for, treatment, when, considering, the, management, of, cranial, trauma, it, is, crucial, to, ensure, that, the, patient, can, breathe, effectively, effective, breathing, can, be, monitored, using, the, patient, s, blood, oxygen, content, via, a, pulse, oximeter, the, goal, is, to, maintain, greater, than, 90, oxygen, saturation, in, the, blood, if, the, patient, cannot, maintain, appropriate, blood, oxygen, levels, on, their, own, mechanical, ventilation, may, be, indicated, mechanical, ventilation, will, add, oxygen, and, remove, carbon, dioxide, in, the, blood, it, is, also, critically, important, to, avoid, low, blood, pressure, in, the, setting, of, traumatic, brain, injuries, studies, have, demonstrated, improved, outcomes, in, patients, with, systolic, blood, pressure, greater, than, or, equal, to, 120mmhg, lastly, healthcare, professionals, should, conduct, consecutive, neurological, examinations, to, allow, for, early, identification, of, elevated, intracranial, pressure, and, subsequent, implementation, of, interventions, to, improve, blood, flow, and, reduce, stress, to, the, body, of, note, patients, taking, anticoagulant, or, antiplatelet, therapy, during, the, time, of, blunt, cranial, trauma, should, undergo, rapid, reversal, of, anticoagulating, agents, nine, out, of, ten, patients, with, thoracic, trauma, can, be, treated, effectively, without, a, surgical, operation, if, surgery, is, indicated, there, are, numerous, options, available, a, comprehensive, discussion, between, the, patient, and, the, surgeon, will, take, place, to, carefully, evaluate, the, best, approach, tailored, to, the, patient, s, specific, condition, and, injury, conservative, measures, such, as, maintaining, a, clear, and, open, airway, oxygen, support, tube, thoracostomy, and, volume, resuscitation, are, often, given, to, manage, blunt, thoracic, trauma, oftentimes, pain, control, is, the, most, basic, and, effective, treatment, approach, because, the, presence, of, severe, pain, may, lead, to, impairment, of, proper, breathing, further, exacerbating, impaired, lungs, pain, management, in, thoracic, trauma, patients, improves, the, ability, to, breathe, properly, on, their, own, encourages, the, excretion, of, pulmonary, secretions, and, decreases, the, aggravation, of, inflammation, and, low, oxygen, levels, in, the, blood, nonsteroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, opioids, or, regional, pain, management, methods, such, as, local, anesthetic, can, be, used, for, pain, control, worldwide, a, significant, cause, of, disability, and, death, in, people, under, the, age, of, 35, is, trauma, of, which, most, are, due, to, blunt, trauma
