arabis, thaliana, arabidopsis, thaliana, the, thale, cress, mouse, ear, cress, or, arabidopsis, is, a, small, plant, from, the, mustard, family, brassicaceae, native, to, eurasia, and, africa, commonly, found, along, the, shoulders, of, roads, and, in, disturbed, land, it, is, generally, considered, a, weed, a, winter, annual, with, a, relatively, short, lifecycle, a, thaliana, is, a, popular, model, organism, in, plant, biology, and, genetics, for, a, complex, multicellular, eukaryote, a, thaliana, has, a, relatively, small, genome, of, around, 135, megabase, pairs, it, was, the, first, plant, to, have, its, genome, sequenced, and, is, an, important, tool, for, understanding, the, molecular, biology, of, many, plant, traits, including, flower, development, and, light, sensing, arabidopsis, thaliana, is, an, annual, rarely, biennial, plant, usually, growing, to, 20, 25, cm, tall, the, leaves, form, a, rosette, at, the, base, of, the, plant, with, a, few, leaves, also, on, the, flowering, stem, the, basal, leaves, are, green, to, slightly, purplish, in, color, 1, 5, 5, cm, long, and, 2, 10, mm, broad, with, an, entire, to, coarsely, serrated, margin, the, stem, leaves, are, smaller, and, unstalked, usually, with, an, entire, margin, leaves, are, covered, with, small, unicellular, hairs, called, trichomes, the, flowers, are, 3, mm, in, diameter, arranged, in, a, corymb, their, structure, is, that, of, the, typical, brassicaceae, the, fruit, is, a, siliqua, 5, 20, mm, long, containing, 20, 30, seeds, roots, are, simple, in, structure, with, a, single, primary, root, that, grows, vertically, downward, later, producing, smaller, lateral, roots, these, roots, form, interactions, with, rhizosphere, bacteria, such, as, bacillus, megaterium, a, thaliana, can, complete, its, entire, lifecycle, in, six, weeks, the, central, stem, that, produces, flowers, grows, after, about, 3, weeks, and, the, flowers, naturally, self, pollinate, in, the, lab, a, thaliana, may, be, grown, in, petri, plates, pots, or, hydroponics, under, fluorescent, lights, or, in, a, greenhouse, the, plant, was, first, described, in, 1577, in, the, harz, mountains, by, johannes, thal, 1542, 1583, a, physician, from, nordhausen, th, ringen, germany, who, called, it, pilosella, siliquosa, in, 1753, carl, linnaeus, renamed, the, plant, arabis, thaliana, in, honor, of, thal, in, 1842, german, botanist, gustav, heynhold, erected, the, new, genus, arabidopsis, and, placed, the, plant, in, that, genus, the, generic, name, arabidopsis, comes, from, greek, meaning, resembling, arabis, the, genus, in, which, linnaeus, had, initially, placed, it, thousands, of, natural, inbred, accessions, of, a, thaliana, have, been, collected, from, throughout, its, natural, and, introduced, range, these, accessions, exhibit, considerable, genetic, and, phenotypic, variation, which, can, be, used, to, study, the, adaptation, of, this, species, to, different, environments, a, thaliana, is, native, to, europe, asia, and, africa, and, its, geographic, distribution, is, rather, continuous, from, the, mediterranean, to, scandinavia, and, spain, to, greece, it, also, appears, to, be, native, in, tropical, alpine, ecosystems, in, africa, and, perhaps, south, africa, it, has, been, introduced, and, naturalized, worldwide, including, in, north, america, around, the, 17th, century, a, thaliana, readily, grows, and, often, pioneers, rocky, sandy, and, calcareous, soils, it, is, generally, considered, a, weed, due, to, its, widespread, distribution, in, agricultural, fields, roadsides, railway, lines, waste, ground, and, other, disturbed, habitats, but, due, to, its, limited, competitive, ability, and, small, size, it, is, not, categorized, as, a, noxious, weed, like, most, brassicaceae, species, a, thaliana, is, edible, by, humans, in, a, salad, or, cooked, but, it, does, not, enjoy, widespread, use, as, a, spring, vegetable, botanists, and, biologists, began, to, research, a, thaliana, in, the, early, 1900s, and, the, first, systematic, description, of, mutants, was, done, around, 1945, a, thaliana, is, now, widely, used, for, studying, plant, sciences, including, genetics, evolution, population, genetics, and, plant, development, although, a, thaliana, the, plant, has, little, direct, significance, for, agriculture, a, thaliana, the, model, organism, has, revolutionized, our, understanding, of, the, genetic, cellular, and, molecular, biology, of, flowering, plants, the, first, mutant, in, a, thaliana, was, documented, in, 1873, by, alexander, braun, describing, a, double, flower, phenotype, the, mutated, gene, was, likely, agamous, cloned, and, characterized, in, 1990, friedrich, laibach, who, had, published, the, chromosome, number, in, 1907, did, not, propose, a, thaliana, as, a, model, organism, though, until, 1943, his, student, erna, reinholz, published, her, thesis, on, a, thaliana, in, 1945, describing, the, first, collection, of, a, thaliana, mutants, that, they, generated, using, x, ray, mutagenesis, laibach, continued, his, important, contributions, to, a, thaliana, research, by, collecting, a, large, number, of, accessions, often, questionably, referred, to, as, ecotypes, with, the, help, of, albert, kranz, these, were, organised, into, a, large, collection, of, 750, natural, accessions, of, a, thaliana, from, around, the, world, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, john, langridge, and, george, r, dei, played, an, important, role, in, establishing, a, thaliana, as, a, useful, organism, for, biological, laboratory, experiments, r, dei, wrote, several, scholarly, reviews, instrumental, in, introducing, the, model, to, the, scientific, community, the, start, of, the, a, thaliana, research, community, dates, to, a, newsletter, called, arabidopsis, information, service, established, in, 1964, the, first, international, arabidopsis, conference, was, held, in, 1965, in, g, ttingen, germany, in, the, 1980s, a, thaliana, started, to, become, widely, used, in, plant, research, laboratories, around, the, world, it, was, one, of, several, candidates, that, included, maize, petunia, and, tobacco, the, latter, two, were, attractive, since, they, were, easily, transformable, with, the, then, current, technologies, while, maize, was, a, well, established, genetic, model, for, plant, biology, the, breakthrough, year, for, a, thaliana, as, a, model, plant, was, 1986, in, which, t, dna, mediated, transformation, and, the, first, cloned, a, thaliana, gene, were, described, due, to, the, small, size, of, its, genome, and, because, it, is, diploid, arabidopsis, thaliana, is, useful, for, genetic, mapping, and, sequencing, with, about, 157, megabase, pairs, and, five, chromosomes, a, thaliana, has, one, of, the, smallest, genomes, among, plants, it, was, long, thought, to, have, the, smallest, genome, of, all, flowering, plants, but, that, title, is, now, considered, to, belong, to, plants, in, the, genus, genlisea, order, lamiales, with, genlisea, tuberosa, a, carnivorous, plant, showing, a, genome, size, of, approximately, 61, mbp, it, was, the, first, plant, genome, to, be, sequenced, completed, in, 2000, by, the, arabidopsis, genome, initiative, the, most, up, to, date, version, of, the, a, thaliana, genome, is, maintained, by, the, arabidopsis, information, resource, the, genome, encodes, 27, 600, protein, coding, genes, and, about, 6, 500, non, coding, genes, however, the, uniprot, database, lists, 39, 342, proteins, in, their, arabidopsis, reference, proteome, among, the, 27, 600, protein, coding, genes, 25, 402, 91, 8, are, now, annotated, with, meaningful, product, names, although, a, large, fraction, of, these, proteins, is, likely, only, poorly, understood, and, only, known, in, general, terms, e, g, as, dna, binding, protein, without, known, specificity, uniprot, lists, more, than, 3, 000, proteins, as, uncharacterized, as, part, of, the, reference, proteome, the, plastome, of, a, thaliana, is, a, 154, 478, base, pair, long, dna, molecule, a, size, typically, encountered, in, most, flowering, plants, see, the, list, of, sequenced, plastomes, it, comprises, 136, genes, coding, for, small, subunit, ribosomal, proteins, rps, in, yellow, see, figure, large, subunit, ribosomal, proteins, rpl, orange, hypothetical, chloroplast, open, reading, frame, proteins, ycf, lemon, proteins, involved, in, photosynthetic, reactions, green, or, in, other, functions, red, ribosomal, rnas, rrn, blue, and, transfer, rnas, trn, black, the, mitochondrial, genome, of, a, thaliana, is, 367, 808, base, pairs, long, and, contains, 57, genes, there, are, many, repeated, regions, in, the, arabidopsis, mitochondrial, genome, the, largest, repeats, recombine, regularly, and, isomerize, the, genome, like, most, plant, mitochondrial, genomes, the, arabidopsis, mitochondrial, genome, exists, as, a, complex, arrangement, of, overlapping, branched, and, linear, molecules, in, vivo, genetic, transformation, of, a, thaliana, is, routine, using, agrobacterium, tumefaciens, to, transfer, dna, into, the, plant, genome, the, current, protocol, termed, floral, dip, involves, simply, dipping, flowers, into, a, solution, containing, agrobacterium, carrying, a, plasmid, of, interest, and, a, detergent, this, method, avoids, the, need, for, tissue, culture, or, plant, regeneration, the, a, thaliana, gene, knockout, collections, are, a, unique, resource, for, plant, biology, made, possible, by, the, availability, of, high, throughput, transformation, and, funding, for, genomics, resources, the, site, of, t, dna, insertions, has, been, determined, for, over, 300, 000, independent, transgenic, lines, with, the, information, and, seeds, accessible, through, online, t, dna, databases, through, these, collections, insertional, mutants, are, available, for, most, genes, in, a, thaliana, characterized, accessions, and, mutant, lines, of, a, thaliana, serve, as, experimental, material, in, laboratory, studies, the, most, commonly, used, background, lines, are, l, er, landsberg, erecta, and, col, or, columbia, other, background, lines, less, often, cited, in, the, scientific, literature, are, ws, or, wassilewskija, c24, cvi, or, cape, verde, islands, nossen, etc, see, for, ex, sets, of, closely, related, accessions, named, col, 0, col, 1, etc, have, been, obtained, and, characterized, in, general, mutant, lines, are, available, through, stock, centers, of, which, best, known, are, the, nottingham, arabidopsis, stock, center, nasc, and, the, arabidopsis, biological, resource, center, abrc, in, ohio, usa, the, col, 0, accession, was, selected, by, r, dei, from, within, a, nonirradiated, population, of, seeds, designated, landsberg, which, he, received, from, laibach, columbia, named, for, the, location, of, r, dei, s, former, institution, university, of, missouri, columbia, was, the, reference, accession, sequenced, in, the, arabidopsis, genome, initiative, the, later, landsberg, erecta, line, was, selected, by, r, dei, because, of, its, short, stature, from, a, landsberg, population, he, had, mutagenized, with, x, rays, as, the, l, er, collection, of, mutants, is, derived, from, this, initial, line, l, er, 0, does, not, correspond, to, the, landsberg, accessions, which, designated, la, 0, la, 1, etc, trichome, formation, is, initiated, by, the, glabrous1, protein, knockouts, of, the, corresponding, gene, lead, to, glabrous, plants, this, phenotype, has, already, been, used, in, gene, editing, experiments, and, might, be, of, interest, as, visual, marker, for, plant, research, to, improve, gene, editing, methods, such, as, crispr, cas9, in, 2005, scientists, at, purdue, university, proposed, that, a, thaliana, possessed, an, alternative, to, previously, known, mechanisms, of, dna, repair, producing, an, unusual, pattern, of, inheritance, but, the, phenomenon, observed, reversion, of, mutant, copies, of, the, hothead, gene, to, a, wild, type, state, was, later, suggested, to, be, an, artifact, because, the, mutants, show, increased, outcrossing, due, to, organ, fusion, the, plant, s, small, size, and, rapid, lifecycle, are, also, advantageous, for, research, having, specialized, as, a, spring, ephemeral, it, has, been, used, to, found, several, laboratory, strains, that, take, about, 6, weeks, from, germination, to, mature, seed, the, small, size, of, the, plant, is, convenient, for, cultivation, in, a, small, space, and, it, produces, many, seeds, further, the, selfing, nature, of, this, plant, assists, genetic, experiments, also, as, an, individual, plant, can, produce, several, thousand, seeds, each, of, the, above, criteria, leads, to, a, thaliana, being, valued, as, a, genetic, model, organism, arabidopsis, is, often, the, model, for, study, of, snares, in, plants, this, has, shown, snares, to, be, heavily, involved, in, vesicle, trafficking, zheng, et, al, 1999, found, an, arabidopsis, snare, called, atvti1a, is, probably, essential, to, golgi, vacuole, trafficking, this, is, still, a, wide, open, field, and, plant, snares, role, in, trafficking, remains, understudied, the, dna, of, plants, is, vulnerable, to, ultraviolet, light, and, dna, repair, mechanisms, have, evolved, to, avoid, or, repair, genome, damage, caused, by, uv, kaiser, et, al, showed, that, in, a, thaliana, cyclobutane, pyrimidine, dimers, cpds, induced, by, uv, light, can, be, repaired, by, expression, of, cpd, photolyase, on, may, 12, 2022, nasa, announced, that, specimens, of, arabidopsis, thaliana, had, been, successfully, germinated, and, grown, in, samples, of, lunar, regolith, while, the, plants, successfully, germinated, and, grew, into, seedlings, they, were, not, as, robust, as, specimens, that, had, been, grown, in, volcanic, ash, as, a, control, group, although, the, experiments, also, found, some, variation, in, the, plants, grown, in, regolith, based, on, the, location, the, samples, were, taken, from, as, a, thaliana, grown, in, regolith, gathered, during, apollo, 12, apollo, 17, were, more, robust, than, those, grown, in, samples, taken, during, apollo, 11, a, thaliana, has, been, extensively, studied, as, a, model, for, flower, development, the, developing, flower, has, four, basic, organs, sepals, petals, stamens, and, carpels, which, go, on, to, form, pistils, these, organs, are, arranged, in, a, series, of, whorls, four, sepals, on, the, outer, whorl, followed, by, four, petals, inside, this, six, stamens, and, a, central, carpel, region, homeotic, mutations, in, a, thaliana, result, in, the, change, of, one, organ, to, another, in, the, case, of, the, agamous, mutation, for, example, stamens, become, petals, and, carpels, are, replaced, with, a, new, flower, resulting, in, a, recursively, repeated, sepal, petal, petal, pattern, observations, of, homeotic, mutations, led, to, the, formulation, of, the, abc, model, of, flower, development, by, e, coen, and, e, meyerowitz, according, to, this, model, floral, organ, identity, genes, are, divided, into, three, classes, class, a, genes, which, affect, sepals, and, petals, class, b, genes, which, affect, petals, and, stamens, and, class, c, genes, which, affect, stamens, and, carpels, these, genes, code, for, transcription, factors, that, combine, to, cause, tissue, specification, in, their, respective, regions, during, development, although, developed, through, study, of, a, thaliana, flowers, this, model, is, generally, applicable, to, other, flowering, plants, studies, of, a, thaliana, have, provided, considerable, insights, with, regards, to, the, genetics, of, leaf, morphogenesis, particularly, in, dicotyledon, type, plants, much, of, the, understanding, has, come, from, analyzing, mutants, in, leaf, development, some, of, which, were, identified, in, the, 1960s, but, were, not, analysed, with, genetic, and, molecular, techniques, until, the, mid, 1990s, a, thaliana, leaves, are, well, suited, to, studies, of, leaf, development, because, they, are, relatively, simple, and, stable, using, a, thaliana, the, genetics, behind, leaf, shape, development, have, become, more, clear, and, have, been, broken, down, into, three, stages, the, initiation, of, the, leaf, primordium, the, establishment, of, dorsiventrality, and, the, development, of, a, marginal, meristem, leaf, primordia, are, initiated, by, the, suppression, of, the, genes, and, proteins, of, class, i, knox, family, such, as, shoot, apical, meristemless, these, class, i, knox, proteins, directly, suppress, gibberellin, biosynthesis, in, the, leaf, primordium, many, genetic, factors, were, found, to, be, involved, in, the, suppression, of, these, class, i, knox, genes, in, leaf, primordia, such, as, asymmetric, leaves1, blade, on, petiole1, sawtooth1, etc, thus, with, this, suppression, the, levels, of, gibberellin, increase, and, leaf, primordium, initiate, growth, the, establishment, of, leaf, dorsiventrality, is, important, since, the, dorsal, adaxial, surface, of, the, leaf, is, different, from, the, ventral, abaxial, surface, a, thaliana, is, well, suited, for, light, microscopy, analysis, young, seedlings, on, the, whole, and, their, roots, in, particular, are, relatively, translucent, this, together, with, their, small, size, facilitates, live, cell, imaging, using, both, fluorescence, and, confocal, laser, scanning, microscopy, by, wet, mounting, seedlings, in, water, or, in, culture, media, plants, may, be, imaged, uninvasively, obviating, the, need, for, fixation, and, sectioning, and, allowing, time, lapse, measurements, fluorescent, protein, constructs, can, be, introduced, through, transformation, the, developmental, stage, of, each, cell, can, be, inferred, from, its, location, in, the, plant, or, by, using, fluorescent, protein, markers, allowing, detailed, developmental, analysis, the, photoreceptors, phytochromes, a, b, c, d, and, e, mediate, red, light, based, phototropic, response, understanding, the, function, of, these, receptors, has, helped, plant, biologists, understand, the, signaling, cascades, that, regulate, photoperiodism, germination, de, etiolation, and, shade, avoidance, in, plants, the, genes, fca, fy, fpa, luminidependens, ld, fly, fve, and, flowering, locus, c, flc, are, involved, in, photoperiod, triggering, of, flowering, and, vernalization, specifically, lee, et, al, 1994, find, ld, produces, a, homeodomain, and, blazquez, et, al, 2001, that, fve, produces, a, wd40, repeat, the, uvr8, protein, detects, uv, b, light, and, mediates, the, response, to, this, dna, damaging, wavelength, a, thaliana, was, used, extensively, in, the, study, of, the, genetic, basis, of, phototropism, chloroplast, alignment, and, stomal, aperture, and, other, blue, light, influenced, processes, these, traits, respond, to, blue, light, which, is, perceived, by, the, phototropin, light, receptors, arabidopsis, has, also, been, important, in, understanding, the, functions, of, another, blue, light, receptor, cryptochrome, which, is, especially, important, for, light, entrainment, to, control, the, plants, circadian, rhythms, when, the, onset, of, darkness, is, unusually, early, a, thaliana, reduces, its, metabolism, of, starch, by, an, amount, that, effectively, requires, division, light, responses, were, even, found, in, roots, previously, thought, to, be, largely, insensitive, to, light, while, the, gravitropic, response, of, a, thaliana, root, organs, is, their, predominant, tropic, response, specimens, treated, with, mutagens, and, selected, for, the, absence, of, gravitropic, action, showed, negative, phototropic, response, to, blue, or, white, light, and, positive, response, to, red, light, indicating, that, the, roots, also, show, positive, phototropism, in, 2000, dr, janet, braam, of, rice, university, genetically, engineered, a, thaliana, to, glow, in, the, dark, when, touched, the, effect, was, visible, to, ultrasensitive, cameras, multiple, efforts, including, the, glowing, plant, project, have, sought, to, use, a, thaliana, to, increase, plant, luminescence, intensity, towards, commercially, viable, levels, in, 1990, janet, braam, and, ronald, w, davis, determined, that, a, thaliana, exhibits, thigmomorphogenesis, in, response, to, wind, rain, and, touch, four, or, more, touch, induced, genes, in, a, thaliana, were, found, to, be, regulated, by, such, stimuli, in, 2002, massimo, pigliucci, found, that, a, thaliana, developed, different, patterns, of, branching, in, response, to, sustained, exposure, to, wind, a, display, of, phenotypic, plasticity, on, january, 2, 2019, china, s, chang, e, 4, lander, brought, a, thaliana, to, the, moon, a, small, microcosm, tin, in, the, lander, contained, a, thaliana, seeds, of, potatoes, and, silkworm, eggs, as, plants, would, support, the, silkworms, with, oxygen, and, the, silkworms, would, in, turn, provide, the, plants, with, necessary, carbon, dioxide, and, nutrients, through, their, waste, researchers, will, evaluate, whether, plants, successfully, perform, photosynthesis, and, grow, and, bloom, in, the, lunar, environment, thalianin, is, an, arabidopsis, root, triterpene, potter, et, al, 2018, finds, synthesis, is, induced, by, a, combination, of, at, least, 2, facts, cell, specific, transcription, factors, tfs, and, the, accessibility, of, the, chromatin, understanding, how, plants, achieve, resistance, is, important, to, protect, the, world, s, food, production, and, the, agriculture, industry, many, model, systems, have, been, developed, to, better, understand, interactions, between, plants, and, bacterial, fungal, oomycete, viral, and, nematode, pathogens, a, thaliana, has, been, a, powerful, tool, for, the, study, of, the, subdiscipline, of, plant, pathology, that, is, the, interaction, between, plants, and, disease, causing, pathogens, the, use, of, a, thaliana, has, led, to, many, breakthroughs, in, the, advancement, of, knowledge, of, how, plants, manifest, plant, disease, resistance, the, reason, most, plants, are, resistant, to, most, pathogens, is, through, nonhost, resistance, not, all, pathogens, will, infect, all, plants, an, example, where, a, thaliana, was, used, to, determine, the, genes, responsible, for, nonhost, resistance, is, blumeria, graminis, the, causal, agent, of, powdery, mildew, of, grasses, a, thaliana, mutants, were, developed, using, the, mutagen, ethyl, methanesulfonate, and, screened, to, identify, mutants, with, increased, infection, by, b, graminis, the, mutants, with, higher, infection, rates, are, referred, to, as, pen, mutants, due, to, the, ability, of, b, graminis, to, penetrate, a, thaliana, to, begin, the, disease, process, the, pen, genes, were, later, mapped, to, identify, the, genes, responsible, for, nonhost, resistance, to, b, graminis, in, general, when, a, plant, is, exposed, to, a, pathogen, or, nonpathogenic, microbe, an, initial, response, known, as, pamp, triggered, immunity, pti, occurs, because, the, plant, detects, conserved, motifs, known, as, pathogen, associated, molecular, patterns, pamps, these, pamps, are, detected, by, specialized, receptors, in, the, host, known, as, pattern, recognition, receptors, prrs, on, the, plant, cell, surface, the, best, characterized, prr, in, a, thaliana, is, fls2, flagellin, sensing2, which, recognizes, bacterial, flagellin, a, specialized, organelle, used, by, microorganisms, for, the, purpose, of, motility, as, well, as, the, ligand, flg22, which, comprises, the, 22, amino, acids, recognized, by, fls2, discovery, of, fls2, was, facilitated, by, the, identification, of, an, a, thaliana, ecotype, ws, 0, that, was, unable, to, detect, flg22, leading, to, the, identification, of, the, gene, encoding, fls2, fls2, shows, striking, similarity, to, rice, xa21, the, first, prr, isolated, in, 1995, both, flagellin, and, uv, c, act, similarly, to, increase, homologous, recombination, in, a, thaliana, as, demonstrated, by, molinier, et, al, 2006, beyond, this, somatic, effect, they, found, this, to, extend, to, subsequent, generations, of, the, plant, a, second, prr, ef, tu, receptor, efr, identified, in, a, thaliana, recognizes, the, bacterial, ef, tu, protein, the, prokaryotic, elongation, factor, used, in, protein, synthesis, as, well, as, the, laboratory, used, ligand, elf18, using, agrobacterium, mediated, transformation, a, technique, that, takes, advantage, of, the, natural, process, by, which, agrobacterium, transfers, genes, into, host, plants, the, efr, gene, was, transformed, into, nicotiana, benthamiana, tobacco, plant, that, does, not, recognize, ef, tu, thereby, permitting, recognition, of, bacterial, ef, tu, thereby, confirming, efr, as, the, receptor, of, ef, tu, both, fls2, and, efr, use, similar, signal, transduction, pathways, to, initiate, pti, a, thaliana, has, been, instrumental, in, dissecting, these, pathways, to, better, understand, the, regulation, of, immune, responses, the, most, notable, one, being, the, mitogen, activated, protein, kinase, map, kinase, cascade, downstream, responses, of, pti, include, callose, deposition, the, oxidative, burst, and, transcription, of, defense, related, genes, pti, is, able, to, combat, pathogens, in, a, nonspecific, manner, a, stronger, and, more, specific, response, in, plants, is, that, of, effector, triggered, immunity, eti, which, is, dependent, upon, the, recognition, of, pathogen, effectors, proteins, secreted, by, the, pathogen, that, alter, functions, in, the, host, by, plant, resistance, genes, r, genes, often, described, as, a, gene, for, gene, relationship, this, recognition, may, occur, directly, or, indirectly, via, a, guardee, protein, in, a, hypothesis, known, as, the, guard, hypothesis, the, first, r, gene, cloned, in, a, thaliana, was, rps2, resistance, to, pseudomonas, syringae, 2, which, is, responsible, for, recognition, of, the, effector, avrrpt2, the, bacterial, effector, avrrpt2, is, delivered, into, a, thaliana, via, the, type, iii, secretion, system, of, p, syringae, pv, tomato, strain, dc3000, recognition, of, avrrpt2, by, rps2, occurs, via, the, guardee, protein, rin4, which, is, cleaved, recognition, of, a, pathogen, effector, leads, to, a, dramatic, immune, response, known, as, the, hypersensitive, response, in, which, the, infected, plant, cells, undergo, cell, death, to, prevent, the, spread, of, the, pathogen, systemic, acquired, resistance, sar, is, another, example, of, resistance, that, is, better, understood, in, plants, because, of, research, done, in, a, thaliana, benzothiadiazol, bth, a, salicylic, acid, sa, analog, has, been, used, historically, as, an, antifungal, compound, in, crop, plants, bth, as, well, as, sa, has, been, shown, to, induce, sar, in, plants, the, initiation, of, the, sar, pathway, was, first, demonstrated, in, a, thaliana, in, which, increased, sa, levels, are, recognized, by, nonexpresser, of, pr, genes, 1, npr1, due, to, redox, change, in, the, cytosol, resulting, in, the, reduction, of, npr1, npr1, which, usually, exists, in, a, multiplex, oligomeric, state, becomes, monomeric, a, single, unit, upon, reduction, when, npr1, becomes, monomeric, it, translocates, to, the, nucleus, where, it, interacts, with, many, tga, transcription, factors, and, is, able, to, induce, pathogen, related, genes, such, as, pr1, another, example, of, sar, would, be, the, research, done, with, transgenic, tobacco, plants, which, express, bacterial, salicylate, hydroxylase, nahg, gene, requires, the, accumulation, of, sa, for, its, expression, although, not, directly, immunological, intracellular, transport, affects, susceptibility, by, incorporating, or, being, tricked, into, incorporating, pathogen, particles, for, example, the, dynamin, related, protein, 2b, drp2b, gene, helps, to, move, invaginated, material, into, cells, with, some, mutants, increasing, pstdc3000, virulence, even, further, plants, are, affected, by, multiple, pathogens, throughout, their, lifetimes, in, response, to, the, presence, of, pathogens, plants, have, evolved, receptors, on, their, cell, surfaces, to, detect, and, respond, to, pathogens, arabidopsis, thaliana, is, a, model, organism, used, to, determine, specific, defense, mechanisms, of, plant, pathogen, resistance, these, plants, have, special, receptors, on, their, cell, surfaces, that, allow, for, detection, of, pathogens, and, initiate, mechanisms, to, inhibit, pathogen, growth, they, contain, two, receptors, fls2, bacterial, flagellin, receptor, and, ef, tu, bacterial, ef, tu, protein, which, use, signal, transduction, pathways, to, initiate, the, disease, response, pathway, the, pathway, leads, to, the, recognition, of, the, pathogen, causing, the, infected, cells, to, undergo, cell, death, to, stop, the, spread, of, the, pathogen, plants, with, fls2, and, ef, tu, receptors, have, shown, to, have, increased, fitness, in, the, population, this, has, led, to, the, belief, that, plant, pathogen, resistance, is, an, evolutionary, mechanism, that, has, built, up, over, generations, to, respond, to, dynamic, environments, such, as, increased, predation, and, extreme, temperatures, a, thaliana, has, also, been, used, to, study, sar, this, pathway, uses, benzothiadiazol, a, chemical, inducer, to, induce, transcription, factors, mrna, of, sar, genes, this, accumulation, of, transcription, factors, leads, to, inhibition, of, pathogen, related, genes, plant, pathogen, interactions, are, important, for, an, understanding, of, how, plants, have, evolved, to, combat, different, types, of, pathogens, that, may, affect, them, variation, in, resistance, of, plants, across, populations, is, due, to, variation, in, environmental, factors, plants, that, have, evolved, resistance, whether, it, be, the, general, variation, or, the, sar, variation, have, been, able, to, live, longer, and, hold, off, necrosis, of, their, tissue, premature, death, of, cells, which, leads, to, better, adaptation, and, fitness, for, populations, that, are, in, rapidly, changing, environments, in, the, future, comparisons, of, the, pathosystems, of, wild, populations, their, coevolved, pathogens, with, wild, wild, hybrids, of, known, parentage, may, reveal, new, mechanisms, of, balancing, selection, in, life, history, theory, we, may, find, that, a, thaliana, maintains, certain, alleles, due, to, pleitropy, between, plant, pathogen, effects, and, other, traits, as, in, livestock, research, in, a, thaliana, suggests, that, the, immunity, regulator, protein, family, eds1, in, general, co, evolved, with, the, cc, helo, family, of, nucleotide, binding, leucine, rich, repeat, receptors, nlrs, xiao, et, al, 2005, have, shown, that, the, powdery, mildew, immunity, mediated, by, a, thaliana, s, rpw8, which, has, a, cc, helo, domain, is, dependent, on, two, members, of, this, family, eds1, itself, and, pad4, resistance, to, pseudomonas, syringae, 5, rps5, is, a, disease, resistance, protein, which, guards, avrpphb, susceptible, 1, pbs1, pbs1, as, the, name, would, suggest, is, the, target, of, avrpphb, an, effector, produced, by, pseudomonas, syringae, pv, phaseolicola, ongoing, research, on, a, thaliana, is, being, performed, on, the, international, space, station, by, the, european, space, agency, the, goals, are, to, study, the, growth, and, reproduction, of, plants, from, seed, to, seed, in, microgravity, plant, on, a, chip, devices, in, which, a, thaliana, tissues, can, be, cultured, in, semi, in, vitro, conditions, have, been, described, use, of, these, devices, may, aid, understanding, of, pollen, tube, guidance, and, the, mechanism, of, sexual, reproduction, in, a, thaliana, researchers, at, the, university, of, florida, were, able, to, grow, the, plant, in, lunar, soil, originating, from, the, sea, of, tranquillity, a, thaliana, is, a, predominantly, self, pollinating, plant, with, an, outcrossing, rate, estimated, at, less, than, 0, 3, an, analysis, of, the, genome, wide, pattern, of, linkage, disequilibrium, suggested, that, self, pollination, evolved, roughly, a, million, years, ago, or, more, meioses, that, lead, to, self, pollination, are, unlikely, to, produce, significant, beneficial, genetic, variability, however, these, meioses, can, provide, the, adaptive, benefit, of, recombinational, repair, of, dna, damages, during, formation, of, germ, cells, at, each, generation, such, a, benefit, may, have, been, sufficient, to, allow, the, long, term, persistence, of, meioses, even, when, followed, by, self, fertilization, a, physical, mechanism, for, self, pollination, in, a, thaliana, is, through, pre, anthesis, autogamy, such, that, fertilisation, takes, place, largely, before, flower, opening
