the, human, voice, consists, of, sound, made, by, a, human, being, using, the, vocal, tract, including, talking, singing, laughing, crying, screaming, shouting, humming, or, yelling, the, human, voice, frequency, is, specifically, a, part, of, human, sound, production, in, which, the, vocal, folds, vocal, cords, are, the, primary, sound, source, other, sound, production, mechanisms, produced, from, the, same, general, area, of, the, body, involve, the, production, of, unvoiced, consonants, clicks, whistling, and, whispering, generally, speaking, the, mechanism, for, generating, the, human, voice, can, be, subdivided, into, three, parts, the, lungs, the, vocal, folds, within, the, larynx, voice, box, and, the, articulators, the, lungs, the, pump, must, produce, adequate, airflow, and, air, pressure, to, vibrate, vocal, folds, the, vocal, folds, vocal, cords, then, vibrate, to, use, airflow, from, the, lungs, to, create, audible, pulses, that, form, the, laryngeal, sound, source, the, muscles, of, the, larynx, adjust, the, length, and, tension, of, the, vocal, folds, to, fine, tune, pitch, and, tone, the, articulators, the, parts, of, the, vocal, tract, above, the, larynx, consisting, of, tongue, palate, cheek, lips, etc, articulate, and, filter, the, sound, emanating, from, the, larynx, and, to, some, degree, can, interact, with, the, laryngeal, airflow, to, strengthen, or, weaken, it, as, a, sound, source, the, vocal, folds, in, combination, with, the, articulators, are, capable, of, producing, highly, intricate, arrays, of, sound, the, tone, of, voice, may, be, modulated, to, suggest, emotions, such, as, anger, surprise, fear, happiness, or, sadness, the, human, voice, is, used, to, express, emotion, and, can, also, reveal, the, age, and, sex, of, the, speaker, singers, use, the, human, voice, as, an, instrument, for, creating, music, adult, men, and, women, typically, have, different, sizes, of, vocal, fold, reflecting, the, male, female, differences, in, larynx, size, adult, male, voices, are, usually, lower, pitched, and, have, larger, folds, the, male, vocal, folds, which, would, be, measured, vertically, in, the, opposite, diagram, are, between, 17, mm, and, 25, mm, in, length, the, female, vocal, folds, are, between, 12, 5, mm, and, 17, 5, mm, in, length, the, folds, are, within, the, larynx, they, are, attached, at, the, back, side, nearest, the, spinal, cord, to, the, arytenoids, cartilages, and, at, the, front, side, under, the, chin, to, the, thyroid, cartilage, they, have, no, outer, edge, as, they, blend, into, the, side, of, the, breathing, tube, the, illustration, is, out, of, date, and, does, not, show, this, well, while, their, inner, edges, or, margins, are, free, to, vibrate, the, hole, they, have, a, three, layer, construction, of, an, epithelium, vocal, ligament, then, muscle, vocalis, muscle, which, can, shorten, and, bulge, the, folds, they, are, flat, triangular, bands, and, are, pearly, white, in, color, above, both, sides, of, the, vocal, cord, is, the, vestibular, fold, or, false, vocal, cord, which, has, a, small, sac, between, its, two, folds, the, difference, in, vocal, folds, size, between, men, and, women, means, that, they, have, differently, pitched, voices, additionally, genetics, also, causes, variances, amongst, the, same, sex, with, men, s, and, women, s, singing, voices, being, categorized, into, types, for, example, among, men, there, are, bass, bass, baritone, baritone, baritenor, tenor, and, countertenor, ranging, from, e2, to, c, 7, and, higher, and, among, women, contralto, alto, mezzo, soprano, and, soprano, ranging, from, f3, to, c6, and, higher, there, are, additional, categories, for, operatic, voices, see, voice, type, this, is, not, the, only, source, of, difference, between, male, and, female, voice, men, generally, speaking, have, a, larger, vocal, tract, which, essentially, gives, the, resultant, voice, a, lower, sounding, timbre, this, is, mostly, independent, of, the, vocal, folds, themselves, human, spoken, language, makes, use, of, the, ability, of, almost, all, people, in, a, given, society, to, dynamically, modulate, certain, parameters, of, the, laryngeal, voice, source, in, a, consistent, manner, the, most, important, communicative, or, phonetic, parameters, are, the, voice, pitch, determined, by, the, vibratory, frequency, of, the, vocal, folds, and, the, degree, of, separation, of, the, vocal, folds, referred, to, as, vocal, fold, adduction, coming, together, or, abduction, separating, the, ability, to, vary, the, ab, adduction, of, the, vocal, folds, quickly, has, a, strong, genetic, component, since, vocal, fold, adduction, has, a, life, preserving, function, in, keeping, food, from, passing, into, the, lungs, in, addition, to, the, covering, action, of, the, epiglottis, consequently, the, muscles, that, control, this, action, are, among, the, fastest, in, the, body, children, can, learn, to, use, this, action, consistently, during, speech, at, an, early, age, as, they, learn, to, speak, the, difference, between, utterances, such, as, apa, having, an, abductory, adductory, gesture, for, the, p, as, aba, having, no, abductory, adductory, gesture, they, can, learn, to, do, this, well, before, the, age, of, two, by, listening, only, to, the, voices, of, adults, around, them, who, have, voices, much, different, from, their, own, and, even, though, the, laryngeal, movements, causing, these, phonetic, differentiations, are, deep, in, the, throat, and, not, visible, to, them, if, an, abductory, movement, or, adductory, movement, is, strong, enough, the, vibrations, of, the, vocal, folds, will, stop, or, not, start, if, the, gesture, is, abductory, and, is, part, of, a, speech, sound, the, sound, will, be, called, voiceless, however, voiceless, speech, sounds, are, sometimes, better, identified, as, containing, an, abductory, gesture, even, if, the, gesture, was, not, strong, enough, to, stop, the, vocal, folds, from, vibrating, this, anomalous, feature, of, voiceless, speech, sounds, is, better, understood, if, it, is, realized, that, it, is, the, change, in, the, spectral, qualities, of, the, voice, as, abduction, proceeds, that, is, the, primary, acoustic, attribute, that, the, listener, attends, to, when, identifying, a, voiceless, speech, sound, and, not, simply, the, presence, or, absence, of, voice, periodic, energy, an, adductory, gesture, is, also, identified, by, the, change, in, voice, spectral, energy, it, produces, thus, a, speech, sound, having, an, adductory, gesture, may, be, referred, to, as, a, glottal, stop, even, if, the, vocal, fold, vibrations, do, not, entirely, stop, other, aspects, of, the, voice, such, as, variations, in, the, regularity, of, vibration, are, also, used, for, communication, and, are, important, for, the, trained, voice, user, to, master, but, are, more, rarely, used, in, the, formal, phonetic, code, of, a, spoken, language, the, sound, of, each, individual, s, voice, is, thought, to, be, entirely, unique, not, only, because, of, the, actual, shape, and, size, of, an, individual, s, vocal, cords, but, also, due, to, the, size, and, shape, of, the, rest, of, that, person, s, body, especially, the, vocal, tract, and, the, manner, in, which, the, speech, sounds, are, habitually, formed, and, articulated, it, is, this, latter, aspect, of, the, sound, of, the, voice, that, can, be, mimicked, by, skilled, performers, humans, have, vocal, folds, that, can, loosen, tighten, or, change, their, thickness, and, over, which, breath, can, be, transferred, at, varying, pressures, the, shape, of, chest, and, neck, the, position, of, the, tongue, and, the, tightness, of, otherwise, unrelated, muscles, can, be, altered, any, one, of, these, actions, results, in, a, change, in, pitch, volume, timbre, or, tone, of, the, sound, produced, sound, also, resonates, within, different, parts, of, the, body, and, an, individual, s, size, and, bone, structure, can, affect, somewhat, the, sound, produced, by, an, individual, singers, can, also, learn, to, project, sound, in, certain, ways, so, that, it, resonates, better, within, their, vocal, tract, this, is, known, as, vocal, resonation, another, major, influence, on, vocal, sound, and, production, is, the, function, of, the, larynx, which, people, can, manipulate, in, different, ways, to, produce, different, sounds, these, different, kinds, of, laryngeal, function, are, described, as, different, kinds, of, vocal, registers, the, primary, method, for, singers, to, accomplish, this, is, through, the, use, of, the, singer, s, formant, which, has, been, shown, to, be, a, resonance, added, to, the, normal, resonances, of, the, vocal, tract, above, the, frequency, range, of, most, instruments, and, so, enables, the, singer, s, voice, to, carry, better, over, musical, accompaniment, vocal, registration, refers, to, the, system, of, vocal, registers, within, the, human, voice, a, register, in, the, human, voice, is, a, particular, series, of, tones, produced, in, the, same, vibratory, pattern, of, the, vocal, folds, and, possessing, the, same, quality, registers, originate, in, laryngeal, functioning, they, occur, because, the, vocal, folds, are, capable, of, producing, several, different, vibratory, patterns, each, of, these, vibratory, patterns, appears, within, a, particular, vocal, range, of, pitches, and, produces, certain, characteristic, sounds, the, occurrence, of, registers, has, also, been, attributed, to, effects, of, the, acoustic, interaction, between, the, vocal, fold, oscillation, and, the, vocal, tract, the, term, register, can, be, somewhat, confusing, as, it, encompasses, several, aspects, of, the, human, voice, the, term, register, can, be, used, to, refer, to, any, of, the, following, in, linguistics, a, register, language, is, a, language, that, combines, tone, and, vowel, phonation, into, a, single, phonological, system, within, speech, pathology, the, term, vocal, register, has, three, constituent, elements, a, certain, vibratory, pattern, of, the, vocal, folds, a, certain, series, of, pitches, and, a, certain, type, of, sound, speech, pathologists, identify, four, vocal, registers, based, on, the, physiology, of, laryngeal, function, the, vocal, fry, register, the, modal, register, the, falsetto, register, and, the, whistle, register, this, view, is, also, adopted, by, many, vocal, pedagogists, vocal, resonation, is, the, process, by, which, the, basic, product, of, phonation, is, enhanced, in, timbre, and, or, intensity, by, the, air, filled, cavities, through, which, it, passes, on, its, way, to, the, outside, air, various, terms, related, to, the, resonation, process, include, amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and, prolongation, although, in, strictly, scientific, usage, acoustic, authorities, would, question, most, of, them, the, main, point, to, be, drawn, from, these, terms, by, a, singer, or, speaker, is, that, the, result, of, resonation, is, or, should, be, to, make, a, better, sound, there, are, seven, areas, that, may, be, listed, as, possible, vocal, resonators, in, sequence, from, the, lowest, within, the, body, to, the, highest, these, areas, are, the, chest, the, tracheal, tree, the, larynx, itself, the, pharynx, the, oral, cavity, the, nasal, cavity, and, the, sinuses, the, twelve, tone, musical, scale, upon, which, a, large, portion, of, all, music, western, popular, music, in, particular, is, based, may, have, its, roots, in, the, sound, of, the, human, voice, during, the, course, of, evolution, according, to, a, study, published, by, the, new, scientist, analysis, of, recorded, speech, samples, found, peaks, in, acoustic, energy, that, mirrored, the, distances, between, notes, in, the, twelve, tone, scale, there, are, many, disorders, that, affect, the, human, voice, these, include, speech, impediments, and, growths, and, lesions, on, the, vocal, folds, talking, improperly, for, long, periods, of, time, causes, vocal, loading, which, is, stress, inflicted, on, the, speech, organs, when, vocal, injury, is, done, often, an, ent, specialist, may, be, able, to, help, but, the, best, treatment, is, the, prevention, of, injuries, through, good, vocal, production, voice, therapy, is, generally, delivered, by, a, speech, language, pathologist, vocal, nodules, are, caused, over, time, by, repeated, abuse, of, the, vocal, cords, which, results, in, soft, swollen, spots, on, each, vocal, cord, these, spots, develop, into, harder, callous, like, growths, called, nodules, the, longer, the, abuse, occurs, the, larger, and, stiffer, the, nodules, will, become, most, polyps, are, larger, than, nodules, and, may, be, called, by, other, names, such, as, polypoid, degeneration, or, reinke, s, edema, polyps, are, caused, by, a, single, occurrence, and, may, require, surgical, removal, irritation, after, the, removal, may, then, lead, to, nodules, if, additional, irritation, persists, speech, language, therapy, teaches, the, patient, how, to, eliminate, the, irritations, permanently, through, habit, changes, and, vocal, hygiene, hoarseness, or, breathiness, that, lasts, for, more, than, two, weeks, is, a, common, symptom, of, an, underlying, voice, disorder, such, as, nodes, or, polyps, and, should, be, investigated, medically
