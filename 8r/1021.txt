mahogany, is, a, straight, grained, reddish, brown, timber, of, three, tropical, hardwood, species, of, the, genus, swietenia, indigenous, to, the, americas, and, part, of, the, pantropical, chinaberry, family, meliaceae, mahogany, is, used, commercially, for, a, wide, variety, of, goods, due, to, its, coloring, and, durable, nature, it, is, naturally, found, within, the, americas, but, has, also, been, imported, to, plantations, across, asia, and, oceania, the, mahogany, trade, may, have, begun, as, early, as, the, 16th, century, and, flourished, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, in, certain, countries, mahogany, is, considered, an, invasive, species, mahogany, is, wood, from, any, of, three, tree, species, honduran, or, big, leaf, mahogany, swietenia, macrophylla, west, indian, or, cuban, mahogany, swietenia, mahagoni, and, swietenia, humilis, honduran, mahogany, is, the, most, widespread, and, the, only, genuine, mahogany, species, commercially, grown, today, mahogany, is, a, valuable, lumber, used, for, paneling, furniture, boats, musical, instruments, and, other, items, the, united, states, is, the, leading, importer, of, mahogany, while, peru, is, the, largest, exporter, mahogany, is, the, national, tree, of, the, dominican, republic, and, belize, swietenia, species, have, been, introduced, in, various, countries, outside, the, americas, since, the, 1800s, with, many, plantings, becoming, naturalized, forests, all, species, of, swietenia, are, now, listed, by, cites, and, protected, due, to, concerns, over, illegal, logging, and, mismanagement, mahogany, species, can, crossbreed, when, they, grow, in, proximity, and, the, hybrid, between, s, mahagoni, and, s, macrophylla, is, widely, planted, for, timber, the, history, of, the, american, mahogany, trade, dates, back, to, the, 17th, century, when, the, wood, was, first, noticed, by, europeans, during, the, spanish, colonization, of, the, americas, mahogany, became, more, popular, in, the, 18th, century, when, the, british, parliament, removed, import, duties, on, timber, from, british, possessions, leading, to, increased, exports, to, europe, and, north, america, throughout, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, mahogany, from, various, regions, was, imported, into, europe, and, north, america, with, britain, being, the, largest, consumer, by, the, late, 19th, century, african, mahogany, began, to, dominate, the, market, and, by, the, early, 20th, century, the, supply, of, american, mahogany, became, scarcer, in, response, to, concerns, about, the, sustainability, of, mahogany, several, species, have, been, placed, on, cites, appendices, to, regulate, the, trade, mahogany, is, known, for, its, straight, fine, grain, and, durability, making, it, a, popular, choice, for, fine, furniture, boat, construction, and, musical, instruments, however, the, over, harvesting, of, mahogany, and, environmental, concerns, have, led, to, a, decrease, in, its, use, the, etymology, of, mahogany, is, uncertain, and, a, subject, of, debate, the, term, first, appeared, in, john, ogilby, s, america, 1671, referring, to, a, curious, and, rich, wood, from, jamaica, initial, mentions, of, the, mahogany, tree, as, opposed, to, wood, date, to, 1731, with, its, first, detailed, description, in, 1743, attributed, to, swietenia, mahagoni, by, kemp, malone, in, 1940, malone, suggested, that, mahogany, originated, as, a, generic, term, for, wood, in, a, native, bahamian, language, f, bruce, lamb, disagreed, pointing, out, that, the, arawak, language, s, word, for, wood, is, caoba, lamb, identified, a, west, african, origin, for, the, word, in, the, yoruba, oganwo, collectively, m, oganwo, meaning, one, which, is, the, tallest, or, most, high, used, for, the, khaya, genus, of, trees, whose, timber, is, today, called, african, mahogany, lamb, proposes, that, yoruba, and, igbo, people, brought, to, jamaica, as, slaves, identified, the, local, trees, of, the, swietenia, genus, as, m, oganwo, which, developed, into, the, portuguese, term, mogano, which, first, appeared, in, print, as, the, name, of, a, river, in, 1661, before, finally, developing, into, the, english, mahogany, in, jamaica, between, 1655, and, 1670, malone, criticized, this, etymology, arguing, that, the, proposed, metamorphosis, from, the, yoruba, m, oganwo, to, the, portuguese, mogano, to, the, english, mahogany, was, a, logical, and, linguistic, stretch, relying, on, the, conversion, of, the, singular, oganwo, to, the, collective, m, oganwo, which, malone, finds, unlikely, considering, the, tree, s, generally, solitary, nature, he, also, argues, that, lamb, s, earliest, identified, use, of, the, portuguese, mog, a, no, which, is, for, a, river, that, lamb, asserts, must, have, been, so, named, for, the, mahogany, oganwo, trees, on, its, banks, could, just, as, well, have, been, named, for, any, tall, tree, since, oganwo, only, means, tall, lamb, in, turn, criticized, malone, s, methodology, and, perceived, bias, and, maintained, that, there, is, no, evidence, for, mahogany, as, a, generic, word, the, three, species, are, while, only, the, three, swietenia, species, are, classified, officially, as, genuine, mahogany, other, meliaceae, species, with, timber, uses, are, classified, as, true, mahogany, some, may, or, may, not, have, the, word, mahogany, in, their, trade, or, common, name, some, of, these, true, mahoganies, include, the, african, genera, khaya, african, mahogany, and, entandrophragma, sapele, mahogany, new, zealand, mahogany, or, kohekohe, dysoxylum, spectabile, chinese, mahogany, toona, sinensis, indonesian, mahogany, toona, sureni, indian, mahogany, toona, ciliata, chinaberry, melia, azedarach, pink, mahogany, or, bosse, guarea, chittagong, also, known, as, indian, mahogany, chukrasia, velutina, and, crabwood, carapa, guianensis, some, members, of, the, genus, shorea, meranti, balau, or, lauan, of, the, family, dipterocarpaceae, are, also, sometimes, sold, as, philippine, mahogany, although, the, name, is, more, properly, applied, to, another, species, of, toona, toona, calantas, mahogany, is, a, commercially, important, lumber, prized, for, its, beauty, durability, and, color, and, used, for, paneling, and, to, make, furniture, boats, musical, instruments, and, other, items, the, leading, importer, of, mahogany, is, the, united, states, followed, by, britain, while, the, largest, exporter, today, is, peru, which, surpassed, brazil, after, that, country, banned, mahogany, exports, in, 2001, it, is, estimated, that, some, 80, or, 90, percent, of, peruvian, mahogany, exported, to, the, united, states, is, illegally, harvested, with, the, economic, cost, of, illegal, logging, in, peru, placed, conservatively, at, 40, 70, million, usd, annually, it, was, estimated, that, in, 2000, some, 57, 000, mahogany, trees, were, harvested, to, supply, the, u, s, furniture, trade, alone, mahogany, is, the, national, tree, of, the, dominican, republic, and, belize, a, mahogany, tree, with, two, woodcutters, bearing, an, axe, and, a, paddle, also, appears, on, the, belizean, national,

peru, bolivia, and, extreme, western, brazil, in, the, 20th, century, various, botanists, attempted, to, further, define, s, macrophylla, in, south, america, as, a, new, species, such, as, s, candollei, pittier, and, s, tessmannii, harms, but, many, authorities, consider, these, spurious, according, to, record, and, hess, all, of, the, mahogany, of, continental, north, and, south, america, can, be, considered, as, one, botanical, species, swietenia, macrophylla, king, both, major, species, of, swietenia, were, introduced, in, several, countries, outside, of, the, americas, during, the, 1800s, and, early, 1900s, using, seeds, from, south, america, and, the, caribbean, many, of, these, plantings, became, naturalized, forests, over, time, india, had, both, s, macrophylla, and, s, mahagoni, introduced, in, 1865, using, seeds, from, west, indies, both, eventually, became, naturalized, forests, bangladesh, had, honduran, s, macrophylla, introduced, in, 1872, and, as, with, india, it, became, naturalized, in, some, areas, s, mahagoni, and, s, macrophylla, were, introduced, in, indonesia, in, 1870, using, seeds, from, india, s, macrophylla, was, included, in, plantation, forests, planted, in, indonesia, from, the, 1920s, to, the, 1940s, philippines, had, s, macrophylla, introduced, in, 1907, and, in, 1913, as, well, as, s, mahagoni, in, 1911, 1913, 1914, 1920, and, 1922, planting, resumed, in, the, late, 1980s, it, was, planted, with, many, other, exotic, tree, species, for, the, purpose, of, reforestation, s, macrophylla, was, planted, in, sri, lanka, in, 1897, but, it, was, left, unmanaged, until, the, 1950s, when, reforestation, efforts, initiated, by, the, sri, lankan, government, led, to, plantations, being, consciously, developed, in, the, early, 1900s, s, mahagoni, was, planted, on, the, islands, of, o, ahu, and, maui, in, hawaii, but, was, neglected, and, became, naturalized, forests, additionally, s, macrophylla, was, planted, in, 1922, on, o, ahu, and, is, now, naturalized, fiji, had, s, macrophylla, introduced, originally, in, 1911, as, an, ornamental, species, using, seeds, from, honduras, and, belize, fiji, has, become, a, major, producer, of, mahogany, in, the, 21st, century, due, to, a, robust, plantation, program, spanning, over, 50, years, harvesting, began, in, 2003, the, name, mahogany, was, initially, associated, only, with, those, islands, in, the, west, indies, under, british, control, french, colonists, used, the, term, acajou, while, in, the, spanish, territories, it, was, called, caoba, the, origin, of, the, name, is, uncertain, but, it, could, be, a, corruption, of, m, oganwo, the, name, used, by, the, yoruba, and, ibo, people, of, west, africa, to, describe, trees, of, the, genus, khaya, which, is, closely, related, to, swietenia, when, transported, to, jamaica, as, slaves, they, gave, the, same, name, to, the, similar, trees, they, saw, there, though, this, interpretation, has, been, disputed, no, one, has, suggested, a, more, plausible, origin, the, indigenous, arawak, name, for, the, tree, is, not, known, in, 1671, the, word, mahogany, appeared, in, print, for, the, first, time, in, john, ogilby, s, america, among, botanists, and, naturalists, however, the, tree, was, considered, a, type, of, cedar, and, in, 1759, was, classified, by, carl, linnaeus, 1707, 1778, as, cedrela, mahagoni, the, following, year, it, was, assigned, to, a, new, genus, by, nicholas, joseph, jacquin, 1727, 1817, and, named, swietenia, mahagoni, until, the, 19th, century, all, of, the, mahogany, was, regarded, as, one, species, although, varying, in, quality, and, character, according, to, soil, and, climate, in, 1836, the, german, botanist, joseph, gerhard, zuccarini, 1797, 1848, identified, a, second, species, while, working, on, specimens, collected, on, the, pacific, coast, of, mexico, and, named, it, swietenia, humilis, in, 1886, a, third, species, swietenia, macrophylla, was, named, by, sir, george, king, 1840, 1909, after, studying, specimens, of, honduras, mahogany, planted, in, the, botanic, gardens, in, calcutta, india, today, all, species, of, swietenia, grown, in, their, native, locations, are, listed, by, cites, and, are, therefore, protected, after, s, mahogani, and, s, macrophylla, were, added, to, cites, appendixes, in, 1992, and, 1995, respectively, international, conservation, programs, began, in, earnest, aided, by, a, 1993, world, bank, report, entitled, tropical, hardwood, marketing, strategies, for, southeast, asia, efforts, to, repopulate, mahogany, largely, failed, in, its, native, locations, due, to, attacks, from, the, shoot, borer, hypsipyla, grandella, and, similarly, failed, in, africa, due, to, the, attacks, by, the, equivalent, hypsipyla, robusta, after, so, many, years, of, mismanagement, and, illegal, logging, swietenia, also, suffered, from, genetic, loss, thus, mutating, and, weakening, the, seeds, additionally, erosion, in, its, native, locations, meant, seeds, could, no, longer, even, be, planted, however, both, species, grew, well, in, asia, and, asia, pacific, due, to, the, absence, of, these, shoot, borers, and, absence, of, other, limitations, plantation, management, progressed, throughout, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, in, asia, and, the, south, pacific, global, supply, of, genuine, mahogany, has, been, increasing, from, these, plantations, notably, fiji, and, philippines, for, swietenia, macrophylla, the, trees, in, these, plantations, are, still, relatively, young, compared, to, the, trees, being, harvested, from, old, growth, forests, in, south, america, thus, the, illegal, trade, of, bigleaf, mahogany, continues, apace, species, of, swietenia, cross, breed, readily, when, they, grow, in, proximity, the, hybrid, between, s, mahagoni, and, s, macrophylla, is, widely, planted, for, its, timber, in, addition, the, u, s, timber, trade, also, markets, various, other, federal, trade, commission, defined, species, as, mahoganies, under, a, variety, of, different, commercial, names, most, notably, philippine, mahogany, which, is, actually, from, the, genus, shorea, a, dipterocarp, this, wood, is, also, called, lauan, or, meranti, in, the, 17th, century, the, buccaneer, alexandre, exquemelin, recorded, the, use, of, mahogany, or, caoba, cedrela, being, the, spanish, name, on, hispaniola, for, making, canoes, the, indians, make, these, canoes, without, the, use, of, any, iron, instruments, by, only, burning, the, trees, at, the, bottom, near, the, root, and, afterwards, governing, the, fire, with, such, industry, that, nothing, is, burnt, more, than, what, they, would, have, the, wood, first, came, to, the, notice, of, europeans, with, the, beginning, of, spanish, colonisation, in, the, americas, a, cross, in, the, cathedral, at, santo, domingo, bearing, the, date, 1514, is, said, to, be, mahogany, and, philip, ii, of, spain, apparently, used, the, wood, for, the, interior, joinery, of, the, palace, el, escorial, begun, in, 1584, however, caoba, as, the, taino, natives, called, the, wood, was, principally, reserved, for, shipbuilding, and, it, was, declared, a, royal, monopoly, at, havana, in, 1622, hence, very, little, of, the, mahogany, growing, in, spanish, controlled, territory, found, its, way, to, europe, after, the, french, established, a, colony, in, saint, domingue, now, haiti, some, mahogany, from, that, island, probably, found, its, way, to, france, where, joiners, in, the, port, cities, of, saint, malo, nantes, la, rochelle, and, bordeaux, used, the, wood, to, a, limited, extent, from, about, 1700, on, the, english, controlled, islands, especially, jamaica, and, the, bahamas, mahogany, was, abundant, but, not, exported, in, any, quantity, before, 1700, while, the, trade, in, mahogany, from, the, spanish, and, french, territories, in, america, remained, moribund, for, most, of, the, 18th, century, this, was, not, true, for, those, islands, under, british, control, in, 1721, the, british, parliament, removed, all, import, duties, from, timber, imported, into, britain, from, british, possessions, in, the, americas, this, immediately, stimulated, the, trade, in, west, indian, timbers, including, most, importantly, mahogany, importations, of, mahogany, into, england, and, excluding, those, to, scotland, which, were, recorded, separately, reached, 525, tons, per, annum, by, 1740, 3, 688, tons, by, 1750, and, more, than, 30, 000, tons, in, 1788, the, peak, year, of, the, 18th, century, trade, at, the, same, time, the, 1721, act, had, the, effect, of, substantially, increasing, exports, of, mahogany, from, the, west, indies, to, the, british, colonies, in, north, america, although, initially, regarded, as, a, joinery, wood, mahogany, rapidly, became, the, timber, of, choice, for, makers, of, high, quality, furniture, in, both, the, british, isles, and, the, 13, colonies, of, north, america, until, the, 1760s, over, 90, per, cent, of, the, mahogany, imported, into, britain, came, from, jamaica, some, of, this, was, re, exported, to, continental, europe, but, most, was, used, by, british, furniture, makers, quantities, of, jamaican, mahogany, also, went, to, the, north, american, colonies, but, most, of, the, wood, used, in, american, furniture, came, from, the, bahamas, this, was, sometimes, called, providence, wood, after, the, main, port, of, the, islands, but, more, often, madera, or, madeira, which, was, the, west, indian, name, for, mahogany, in, addition, to, jamaica, and, bahamas, all, the, british, controlled, islands, exported, some, mahogany, at, various, times, but, the, quantities, were, not, large, the, most, significant, third, source, was, black, river, and, adjacent, areas, on, the, mosquito, coast, now, republic, of, honduras, from, where, quantities, of, mahogany, were, shipped, from, the, 1740s, onwards, this, mahogany, was, known, as, rattan, mahogany, after, the, island, of, ruatan, which, was, the, main, offshore, entrepot, for, the, british, settlers, in, the, area, at, the, end, of, the, seven, years, war, 1756, 63, the, mahogany, trade, began, to, change, significantly, during, the, occupation, of, havana, by, british, forces, between, august, 1762, and, july, 1763, quantities, of, cuban, or, havanna, mahogany, were, sent, to, britain, and, after, the, city, was, restored, to, spain, in, 1763, cuba, continued, to, export, small, quantities, mostly, to, ports, on, the, north, coast, of, jamaica, from, where, it, went, to, britain, however, this, mahogany, was, regarded, as, inferior, to, the, jamaican, variety, and, the, trade, remained, sporadic, until, the, 19th, century, another, variety, new, to, the, market, was, hispaniola, mahogany, also, called, spanish, and, st, domingo, mahogany, this, was, the, result, of, the, free, ports, act, of, 1766, which, opened, kingston, and, other, designated, jamaican, ports, to, foreign, vessels, for, the, first, time, the, object, was, primarily, to, encourage, importations, of, cotton, from, french, plantations, in, saint, domingue, but, quantities, of, high, quality, mahogany, were, also, shipped, these, were, then, forwarded, to, britain, where, they, entered, the, market, in, the, late, 1760s, in, terms, of, quantity, the, most, significant, new, addition, to, the, mahogany, trade, was, honduras, mahogany, also, called, baywood, after, the, bay, of, honduras, british, settlers, had, been, active, in, southern, yucatan, since, the, beginning, of, the, 18th, century, despite, the, opposition, of, the, spanish, who, claimed, sovereignty, over, all, of, central, america, their, main, occupation, was, cutting, logwood, a, dyewood, in, high, demand, in, europe, the, center, of, their, activity, and, the, primary, point, of, export, was, belize, under, article, xvii, of, the, treaty, of, paris, 1763, british, cutters, were, for, the, first, time, given, the, right, to, cut, logwood, in, yucatan, unmolested, within, agreed, limits, such, was, the, enthusiasm, of, the, cutters, that, within, a, few, years, the, european, market, was, glutted, and, the, price, of, logwood, collapsed, however, the, price, of, mahogany, was, still, high, after, the, war, and, so, the, cutters, turned, to, cutting, mahogany, the, first, honduras, mahogany, arrived, in, kingston, jamaica, in, november, 1763, and, the, first, shipments, arrived, in, britain, the, following, year, by, the, 1790s, most, of, the, viable, stocks, of, mahogany, in, jamaica, had, been, cut, and, the, market, was, divided, between, two, principal, sources, or, types, of, mahogany, honduras, mahogany, was, relatively, cheap, plentiful, but, rarely, of, the, best, quality, hispaniola, also, called, spanish, or, santo, domingo, mahogany, was, the, wood, of, choice, for, high, quality, work, data, are, lacking, but, it, is, likely, that, the, newly, independent, united, states, now, received, a, good, proportion, of, its, mahogany, from, cuba, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 18th, century, france, began, to, use, mahogany, more, widely, they, had, ample, supplies, of, high, quality, wood, from, saint, domingue, the, rest, of, europe, where, the, wood, was, increasingly, fashionable, obtained, most, of, their, wood, from, britain, the, french, revolution, of, 1789, and, the, wars, that, followed, radically, changed, the, mahogany, trade, primarily, due, to, the, progressive, collapse, of, the, french, and, spanish, colonial, empires, which, allowed, british, traders, into, areas, previously, closed, to, them, saint, domingue, became, the, independent, republic, of, haiti, and, from, 1808, spanish, controlled, santo, domingo, and, cuba, were, both, open, to, british, vessels, for, the, first, time, from, the, 1820s, mahogany, from, all, these, areas, was, imported, into, europe, and, north, america, with, the, majority, of, them, going, to, britain, in, central, america, british, loggers, moved, northwest, towards, mexico, and, south, into, guatemala, other, areas, of, central, america, as, far, south, as, panama, also, began, to, be, exploited, the, most, important, new, development, was, the, beginning, of, large, scale, logging, in, mexico, from, the, 1860s, most, mahogany, was, cut, in, the, province, of, tabasco, and, exported, from, a, number, of, ports, on, the, gulf, of, campeche, from, vera, cruz, eastwards, to, campeche, and, sisal, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, there, was, scarcely, any, part, of, central, america, within, reach, of, the, coast, untouched, by, logging, and, activity, also, extended, into, colombia, venezuela, peru, and, brazil, trade, in, american, mahogany, probably, reached, a, peak, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, figures, are, not, available, for, all, countries, but, britain, alone, imported, more, than, 80, 000, tons, in, 1875, this, figure, was, not, matched, again, from, the, 1880s, african, mahogany, khaya, spp, a, related, genus, began, to, be, exported, in, increasing, quantities, from, west, africa, and, by, the, early, 20th, century, it, dominated, the, market, in, 1907, the, total, of, mahogany, from, all, sources, imported, into, europe, was, 159, 830, tons, of, which, 121, 743, tons, were, from, west, africa, by, this, time, mahogany, from, cuba, haiti, and, other, west, indian, sources, had, become, increasingly, difficult, to, obtain, in, commercial, sizes, and, by, the, late, 20th, century, central, american, and, even, south, american, mahogany, was, heading, in, a, similar, direction, in, 1975, s, humilis, was, placed, on, cites, appendix, ii, a, list, of, species, that, would, be, in, danger, of, extinction, without, strict, regulation, followed, by, s, mahagoni, in, 1992, the, most, abundant, species, s, macrophylla, was, placed, on, appendix, iii, in, 1995, and, moved, to, appendix, ii, in, 2003, mahogany, has, a, straight, fine, and, even, grain, and, is, relatively, free, of, voids, and, pockets, its, reddish, brown, color, darkens, over, time, and, displays, a, reddish, sheen, when, polished, it, has, excellent, workability, and, is, very, durable, historically, the, tree, s, girth, allowed, for, wide, boards, from, traditional, mahogany, species, these, properties, make, it, a, favorable, wood, for, crafting, cabinets, and, furniture, much, of, the, first, quality, furniture, made, in, the, american, colonies, from, the, mid, 18th, century, was, made, of, mahogany, when,
