the, stomach, is, a, muscular, hollow, organ, in, the, upper, gastrointestinal, tract, of, humans, and, many, other, animals, including, several, invertebrates, the, stomach, has, a, dilated, structure, and, functions, as, a, vital, organ, in, the, digestive, system, the, stomach, is, involved, in, the, gastric, phase, of, digestion, following, the, cephalic, phase, in, which, the, sight, and, smell, of, food, and, the, act, of, chewing, are, stimuli, in, the, stomach, a, chemical, breakdown, of, food, takes, place, by, means, of, secreted, digestive, enzymes, and, gastric, acid, the, stomach, is, located, between, the, esophagus, and, the, small, intestine, the, pyloric, sphincter, controls, the, passage, of, partially, digested, food, chyme, from, the, stomach, into, the, duodenum, the, first, and, shortest, part, of, the, small, intestine, where, peristalsis, takes, over, to, move, this, through, the, rest, of, the, intestines, in, the, human, digestive, system, the, stomach, lies, between, the, esophagus, and, the, duodenum, the, first, part, of, the, small, intestine, it, is, in, the, left, upper, quadrant, of, the, abdominal, cavity, the, top, of, the, stomach, lies, against, the, diaphragm, lying, behind, the, stomach, is, the, pancreas, a, large, double, fold, of, visceral, peritoneum, called, the, greater, omentum, hangs, down, from, the, greater, curvature, of, the, stomach, two, sphincters, keep, the, contents, of, the, stomach, contained, the, lower, esophageal, sphincter, found, in, the, cardiac, region, at, the, junction, of, the, esophagus, and, stomach, and, the, pyloric, sphincter, at, the, junction, of, the, stomach, with, the, duodenum, the, stomach, is, surrounded, by, parasympathetic, inhibitor, and, sympathetic, stimulant, plexuses, networks, of, blood, vessels, and, nerves, in, the, anterior, gastric, posterior, superior, and, inferior, celiac, and, myenteric, which, regulate, both, the, secretory, activity, of, the, stomach, and, the, motor, motion, activity, of, its, muscles, the, stomach, is, distensible, and, can, normally, expand, to, hold, about, one, litre, of, food, in, a, newborn, human, baby, the, stomach, will, only, be, able, to, hold, about, 30, millilitres, the, maximum, stomach, volume, in, adults, is, between, 2, and, 4, litres, although, volumes, of, up, to, 15, litres, have, been, observed, in, extreme, circumstances, the, human, stomach, can, be, divided, into, four, sections, beginning, at, the, cardia, followed, by, the, fundus, the, body, and, the, pylorus, the, cardia, is, defined, as, the, region, following, the, z, line, of, the, gastroesophageal, junction, the, point, at, which, the, epithelium, changes, from, stratified, squamous, to, columnar, near, the, cardia, is, the, lower, esophageal, sphincter, the, stomach, bed, refers, to, the, structures, upon, which, the, stomach, rests, in, mammals, these, include, the, tail, of, the, pancreas, splenic, artery, left, kidney, left, suprarenal, gland, transverse, colon, and, its, mesocolon, and, the, left, crus, of, diaphragm, and, the, left, colic, flexure, the, term, was, introduced, around, 1896, by, philip, polson, of, the, catholic, university, school, of, medicine, dublin, however, this, was, brought, into, disrepute, by, surgeon, anatomist, j, massey, the, lesser, curvature, of, the, human, stomach, is, supplied, by, the, right, gastric, artery, inferiorly, and, the, left, gastric, artery, superiorly, which, also, supplies, the, cardiac, region, the, greater, curvature, is, supplied, by, the, right, gastroepiploic, artery, inferiorly, and, the, left, gastroepiploic, artery, superiorly, the, fundus, of, the, stomach, and, also, the, upper, portion, of, the, greater, curvature, is, supplied, by, the, short, gastric, arteries, which, arise, from, the, splenic, artery, the, two, sets, of, gastric, lymph, nodes, drain, the, stomach, like, the, other, parts, of, the, gastrointestinal, wall, the, human, stomach, wall, from, inner, to, outer, consists, of, a, mucosa, submucosa, muscular, layer, subserosa, and, serosa, the, inner, part, of, the, stomach, wall, is, the, gastric, mucosa, a, mucous, membrane, that, forms, the, lining, of, the, stomach, the, membrane, consists, of, an, outer, layer, of, columnar, epithelium, a, lamina, propria, and, a, thin, layer, of, smooth, muscle, called, the, muscularis, mucosa, beneath, the, mucosa, lies, the, submucosa, consisting, of, fibrous, connective, tissue, meissner, s, plexus, is, in, this, layer, interior, to, the, oblique, muscle, layer, outside, of, the, submucosa, lies, the, muscular, layer, it, consists, of, three, layers, of, muscular, fibres, with, fibres, lying, at, angles, to, each, other, these, are, the, inner, oblique, middle, circular, and, outer, longitudinal, layers, the, presence, of, the, inner, oblique, layer, is, distinct, from, other, parts, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, which, do, not, possess, this, layer, the, stomach, contains, the, thickest, muscular, layer, consisting, of, three, layers, thus, maximum, peristalsis, occurs, here, the, outer, longitudinal, layer, is, responsible, for, moving, the, semi, digested, food, towards, the, pylorus, of, the, stomach, through, muscular, shortening, to, the, outside, of, the, muscular, layer, lies, a, serosa, consisting, of, layers, of, connective, tissue, continuous, with, the, peritoneum, smooth, mucosa, along, the, inside, of, the, lesser, curvature, forms, a, passageway, the, gastric, canal, that, fast, tracks, liquids, entering, the, stomach, to, the, pylorus, the, mucosa, lining, the, stomach, is, lined, with, gastric, pits, which, receive, gastric, juice, secreted, by, between, 2, and, 7, gastric, glands, gastric, juice, is, an, acidic, fluid, containing, hydrochloric, acid, and, digestive, enzymes, the, glands, contains, a, number, of, cells, with, the, function, of, the, glands, changing, depending, on, their, position, within, the, stomach, within, the, body, and, fundus, of, the, stomach, lie, the, fundic, glands, in, general, these, glands, are, lined, by, column, shaped, cells, that, secrete, a, protective, layer, of, mucus, and, bicarbonate, additional, cells, present, include, parietal, cells, that, secrete, hydrochloric, acid, and, intrinsic, factor, chief, cells, that, secrete, pepsinogen, this, is, a, precursor, to, pepsin, the, highly, acidic, environment, converts, the, pepsinogen, to, pepsin, and, neuroendocrine, cells, that, secrete, serotonin, glands, differ, where, the, stomach, meets, the, esophagus, and, near, the, pylorus, near, the, gastroesophageal, junction, lie, cardiac, glands, which, primarily, secrete, mucus, they, are, fewer, in, number, than, the, other, gastric, glands, and, are, more, shallowly, positioned, in, the, mucosa, there, are, two, kinds, either, simple, tubular, glands, with, short, ducts, or, compound, racemose, resembling, the, duodenal, brunner, s, glands, near, the, pylorus, lie, pyloric, glands, located, in, the, antrum, of, the, pylorus, they, secrete, mucus, as, well, as, gastrin, produced, by, their, g, cells, about, 20, 000, protein, coding, genes, are, expressed, in, human, cells, and, nearly, 70, of, these, genes, are, expressed, in, the, normal, stomach, just, over, 150, of, these, genes, are, more, specifically, expressed, in, the, stomach, compared, to, other, organs, with, only, some, 20, genes, being, highly, specific, the, corresponding, specific, proteins, expressed, in, stomach, are, mainly, involved, in, creating, a, suitable, environment, for, handling, the, digestion, of, food, for, uptake, of, nutrients, highly, stomach, specific, proteins, include, gastrokine, 1, expressed, in, the, mucosa, pepsinogen, and, gastric, lipase, expressed, in, gastric, chief, cells, and, a, gastric, atpase, and, gastric, intrinsic, factor, expressed, in, parietal, cells, in, the, early, part, of, the, development, of, the, human, embryo, the, ventral, part, of, the, embryo, abuts, the, yolk, sac, during, the, third, week, of, development, as, the, embryo, grows, it, begins, to, surround, parts, of, the, yolk, sac, the, enveloped, portions, form, the, basis, for, the, adult, gastrointestinal, tract, the, sac, is, surrounded, by, a, network, of, vitelline, arteries, and, veins, over, time, these, arteries, consolidate, into, the, three, main, arteries, that, supply, the, developing, gastrointestinal, tract, the, celiac, artery, superior, mesenteric, artery, and, inferior, mesenteric, artery, the, areas, supplied, by, these, arteries, are, used, to, define, the, foregut, midgut, and, hindgut, the, surrounded, sac, becomes, the, primitive, gut, sections, of, this, gut, begin, to, differentiate, into, the, organs, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, and, the, esophagus, and, stomach, form, from, the, foregut, as, the, stomach, rotates, during, early, development, the, dorsal, and, ventral, mesentery, rotate, with, it, this, rotation, produces, a, space, anterior, to, the, expanding, stomach, called, the, greater, sac, and, a, space, posterior, to, the, stomach, called, the, lesser, sac, after, this, rotation, the, dorsal, mesentery, thins, and, forms, the, greater, omentum, which, is, attached, to, the, greater, curvature, of, the, stomach, the, ventral, mesentery, forms, the, lesser, omentum, and, is, attached, to, the, developing, liver, in, the, adult, these, connective, structures, of, omentum, and, mesentery, form, the, peritoneum, and, act, as, an, insulating, and, protective, layer, while, also, supplying, organs, with, blood, and, lymph, vessels, as, well, as, nerves, arterial, supply, to, all, these, structures, is, from, the, celiac, trunk, and, venous, drainage, is, by, the, portal, venous, system, lymph, from, these, organs, is, drained, to, the, prevertebral, celiac, nodes, at, the, origin, of, the, celiac, artery, from, the, aorta, in, the, human, digestive, system, a, bolus, a, small, rounded, mass, of, chewed, up, food, enters, the, stomach, through, the, esophagus, via, the, lower, esophageal, sphincter, the, stomach, releases, proteases, protein, digesting, enzymes, such, as, pepsin, and, hydrochloric, acid, which, kills, or, inhibits, bacteria, and, provides, the, acidic, ph, of, 2, for, the, proteases, to, work, food, is, churned, by, the, stomach, through, peristaltic, muscular, contractions, of, the, wall, reducing, the, volume, of, the, bolus, before, looping, around, the, fundus, and, the, body, of, stomach, as, the, boluses, are, converted, into, chyme, partially, digested, food, chyme, slowly, passes, through, the, pyloric, sphincter, and, into, the, duodenum, of, the, small, intestine, where, the, extraction, of, nutrients, begins, gastric, juice, in, the, stomach, also, contains, pepsinogen, hydrochloric, acid, activates, this, inactive, form, of, enzyme, into, the, active, form, pepsin, pepsin, breaks, down, proteins, into, polypeptides, within, a, few, moments, after, food, enters, the, stomach, mixing, waves, begin, to, occur, at, intervals, of, approximately, 20, seconds, a, mixing, wave, is, a, unique, type, of, peristalsis, that, mixes, and, softens, the, food, with, gastric, juices, to, create, chyme, the, initial, mixing, waves, are, relatively, gentle, but, these, are, followed, by, more, intense, waves, starting, at, the, body, of, the, stomach, and, increasing, in, force, as, they, reach, the, pylorus, the, pylorus, which, holds, around, 30, ml, of, chyme, acts, as, a, filter, permitting, only, liquids, and, small, food, particles, to, pass, through, the, mostly, but, not, fully, closed, pyloric, sphincter, in, a, process, called, gastric, emptying, rhythmic, mixing, waves, force, about, 3, ml, of, chyme, at, a, time, through, the, pyloric, sphincter, and, into, the, duodenum, release, of, a, greater, amount, of, chyme, at, one, time, would, overwhelm, the, capacity, of, the, small, intestine, to, handle, it, the, rest, of, the, chyme, is, pushed, back, into, the, body, of, the, stomach, where, it, continues, mixing, this, process, is, repeated, when, the, next, mixing, waves, force, more, chyme, into, the, duodenum, gastric, emptying, is, regulated, by, both, the, stomach, and, the, duodenum, the, presence, of, chyme, in, the, duodenum, activates, receptors, that, inhibit, gastric, secretion, this, prevents, additional, chyme, from, being, released, by, the, stomach, before, the, duodenum, is, ready, to, process, it, the, fundus, stores, both, undigested, food, and, gases, that, are, released, during, the, process, of, chemical, digestion, food, may, sit, in, the, fundus, of, the, stomach, for, a, while, before, being, mixed, with, the, chyme, while, the, food, is, in, the, fundus, the, digestive, activities, of, salivary, amylase, continue, until, the, food, begins, mixing, with, the, acidic, chyme, ultimately, mixing, waves, incorporate, this, food, with, the, chyme, the, acidity, of, which, inactivates, salivary, amylase, and, activates, lingual, lipase, lingual, lipase, then, begins, breaking, down, triglycerides, into, free, fatty, acids, and, mono, and, diglycerides, the, breakdown, of, protein, begins, in, the, stomach, through, the, actions, of, hydrochloric, acid, and, the, enzyme, pepsin, the, stomach, can, also, produce, gastric, lipase, which, can, help, digesting, fat, the, contents, of, the, stomach, are, completely, emptied, into, the, duodenum, within, two, to, four, hours, after, the, meal, is, eaten, different, types, of, food, take, different, amounts, of, time, to, process, foods, heavy, in, carbohydrates, empty, fastest, followed, by, high, protein, foods, meals, with, a, high, triglyceride, content, remain, in, the, stomach, the, longest, since, enzymes, in, the, small, intestine, digest, fats, slowly, food, can, stay, in, the, stomach, for, 6, hours, or, longer, when, the, duodenum, is, processing, fatty, chyme, however, this, is, still, a, fraction, of, the, 24, to, 72, hours, that, full, digestion, typically, takes, from, start, to, finish, although, the, absorption, in, the, human, digestive, system, is, mainly, a, function, of, the, small, intestine, some, absorption, of, certain, small, molecules, nevertheless, does, occur, in, the, stomach, through, its, lining, this, includes, the, parietal, cells, of, the, human, stomach, are, responsible, for, producing, intrinsic, factor, which, is, necessary, for, the, absorption, of, vitamin, b12, b12, is, used, in, cellular, metabolism, and, is, necessary, for, the, production, of, red, blood, cells, and, the, functioning, of, the, nervous, system, chyme, from, the, stomach, is, slowly, released, into, the, duodenum, through, coordinated, peristalsis, and, opening, of, the, pyloric, sphincter, the, movement, and, the, flow, of, chemicals, into, the, stomach, are, controlled, by, both, the, autonomic, nervous, system, and, by, the, various, digestive, hormones, of, the, digestive, system, other, than, gastrin, these, hormones, all, act, to, turn, off, the, stomach, action, this, is, in, response, to, food, products, in, the, liver, and, gall, bladder, which, have, not, yet, been, absorbed, the, stomach, needs, to, push, food, into, the, small, intestine, only, when, the, intestine, is, not, busy, while, the, intestine, is, full, and, still, digesting, food, the, stomach, acts, as, storage, for, food, epidermal, growth, factor, egf, results, in, cellular, proliferation, differentiation, and, survival, egf, is, a, low, molecular, weight, polypeptide, first, purified, from, the, mouse, submandibular, gland, but, since, then, found, in, many, human, tissues, including, the, submandibular, gland, and, the, parotid, gland, salivary, egf, which, also, seems, to, be, regulated, by, dietary, inorganic, iodine, also, plays, an, important, physiological, role, in, the, maintenance, of, oro, esophageal, and, gastric, tissue, integrity, the, biological, effects, of, salivary, egf, include, healing, of, oral, and, gastroesophageal, ulcers, inhibition, of, gastric, acid, secretion, stimulation, of, dna, synthesis, and, mucosal, protection, from, intraluminal, injurious, factors, such, as, gastric, acid, bile, acids, pepsin, and, trypsin, and, from, physical, chemical, and, bacterial, agents, the, human, stomach, has, receptors, responsive, to, sodium, glutamate, and, this, information, is, passed, to, the, lateral, hypothalamus, and, limbic, system, in, the, brain, as, a, palatability, signal, through, the, vagus, nerve, the, stomach, can, also, sense, independently, of, tongue, and, oral, taste, receptors, glucose, carbohydrates, proteins, and, fats, this, allows, the, brain, to, link, nutritional, value, of, foods, to, their, tastes, this, syndrome, defines, the, association, between, thyroid, disease, and, chronic, gastritis, which, was, first, described, in, the, 1960s, this, term, was, coined, also, to, indicate, the, presence, of, thyroid, autoantibodies, or, autoimmune, thyroid, disease, in, patients, with, pernicious, anemia, a, late, clinical, stage, of, atrophic, gastritis, in, 1993, a, more, complete, investigation, on, the, stomach, and, thyroid, was, published, reporting, that, the, thyroid, is, embryogenetically, and, phylogenetically, derived, from, a, primitive, stomach, and, that, the, thyroid, cells, such, as, primitive, gastroenteric, cells, migrated, and, specialized, in, uptake, of, iodide, and, in, storage, and, elaboration, of, iodine, compounds, during, vertebrate, evolution, in, fact, the, stomach, and, thyroid, share, iodine, concentrating, ability, and, many, morphological, and, functional, similarities, such, as, cell, polarity, and, apical, microvilli, similar, organ, specific, antigens, and, associated, autoimmune, diseases, secretion, of, glycoproteins, thyroglobulin, and, mucin, and, peptide, hormones, the, digesting, and, readsorbing, ability, and, lastly, similar, ability, to, form, iodotyrosines, by, peroxidase, activity, where, iodide, acts, as, an, electron, donor, in, the, presence, of, h, 2, o, 2, in, the, following, years, many, researchers, published, reviews, about, this, syndrome, a, series, of, radiographs, can, be, used, to, examine, the, stomach, for, various, disorders, this, will, often, include, the, use, of, a, barium, swallow, another, method, of, examination, of, the, stomach, is, the, use, of, an, endoscope, a, gastric, emptying, study, is, considered, the, gold, standard, to, assess, the, gastric, emptying, rate, a, large, number, of, studies, have, indicated, that, most, cases, of, peptic, ulcers, and, gastritis, in, humans, are, caused, by, helicobacter, pylori, infection, and, an, association, has, been, seen, with, the, development, of, stomach, cancer, a, stomach, rumble, is, actually, noise, from, the, intestines, in, humans, many, bariatric, surgery, procedures, involve, the, stomach, in, order, to, lose, weight, a, gastric, band, may, be, placed, around, the, cardia, area, which, can, adjust, to, limit, intake, the, anatomy, of, the, stomach, may, be, modified, or, the, stomach, may, be, bypassed, entirely, surgical, removal, of, the, stomach, is, called, a, gastrectomy, and, removal, of, the, cardia, area, is, a, called, a, cardiectomy, cardiectomy, is, a, term, that, is, also, used, to, describe, the, removal, of, the, heart, a, gastrectomy, may, be, carried, out, because, of, gastric, cancer, or, severe, perforation, of, the, stomach, wall, fundoplication, is, stomach, surgery, in, which, the, fundus, is, wrapped, around, the, lower, esophagus, and, stitched, into, place, it, is, used, to, treat, gastroesophageal, reflux, disease, gerd, the, word, stomach, is, derived, from, greek, stomachos, ultimately, from, stoma, mouth, gastro, and, gastric, meaning, related, to, the, stomach, are, both, derived, from, greek, gaster, belly, although, the, precise, shape, and, size, of, the, stomach, varies, widely, among, different, vertebrates, the, relative, positions, of, the, esophageal, and, duodenal, openings, remain, relatively, constant, as, a, result, the, organ, always, curves, somewhat, to, the, left, before, curving, back, to, meet, the, pyloric, sphincter, however, lampreys, hagfishes, chimaeras, lungfishes, and, some, teleost, fish, have, no, stomach, at, all, with, the, esophagus, opening, directly, into, the, intestine, these, animals, all, consume, diets, that, require, little, storage, of, food, no, predigestion, with, gastric, juices, or, both, the, gastric, lining, is, usually, divided, into, two, regions, an, anterior, portion, lined, by, fundic, glands, and, a, posterior, portion, lined, with, pyloric, glands, cardiac, glands, are, unique, to, mammals, and, even, then, are, absent, in, a, number, of, species, the, distributions, of, these, glands, vary, between, species, and, do, not, always, correspond, with, the, same, regions, as, in, humans, furthermore, in, many, non, human, mammals, a, portion, of, the, stomach, anterior, to, the, cardiac, glands, is, lined, with, epithelium, essentially, identical, to, that, of, the, esophagus, ruminants, in, particular, have, a, complex, stomach, the, first, three, chambers, of, which, are, all, lined, with, esophageal, mucosa, in, birds, and, crocodilians, the, stomach, is, divided, into, two, regions, anteriorly, is, a, narrow, tubular, region, the, proventriculus, lined, by, fundic, glands, and, connecting, the, true, stomach, to, the, crop, beyond, lies, the, powerful, muscular, gizzard, lined, by, pyloric, glands, and, in, some, species, containing, stones, that, the, animal, swallows, to, help, grind, up, food, in, insects, there, is, also, a, crop, the, insect, stomach, is, called, the, midgut, information, about, the, stomach, in, echinoderms, or, molluscs, can, be, found, under, the, respective, articles
