neurosis, pl, neuroses, is, a, term, mainly, used, today, by, followers, of, freudian, thinking, to, describe, mental, disorders, caused, by, past, anxiety, often, that, has, been, repressed, in, recent, history, the, term, has, been, used, to, refer, to, anxiety, related, conditions, more, generally, the, term, neurosis, is, no, longer, used, in, condition, names, or, categories, by, the, world, health, organization, s, international, classification, of, diseases, icd, or, the, american, psychiatric, association, s, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, according, to, the, american, heritage, medical, dictionary, of, 2007, the, term, is, no, longer, used, in, psychiatric, diagnosis, neurosis, is, distinguished, from, psychosis, which, refers, to, a, loss, of, touch, with, reality, its, descendant, term, neuroticism, refers, to, a, personality, trait, of, being, prone, to, anxiousness, and, mental, collapse, the, term, neuroticism, is, also, no, longer, used, for, dsm, or, icd, conditions, however, it, is, a, common, name, for, one, of, the, big, five, personality, traits, a, similar, concept, is, included, in, the, icd, 11, as, the, condition, negative, affectivity, the, term, neurosis, was, coined, by, scottish, doctor, william, cullen, to, refer, to, disorders, of, sense, and, motion, caused, by, a, general, affection, of, the, nervous, system, the, term, is, derived, from, the, greek, word, neuron, nerve, and, the, suffix, osis, diseased, or, abnormal, condition, it, was, first, used, in, print, in, cullen, s, system, of, nosology, first, published, in, latin, in, 1769, cullen, used, the, term, to, describe, various, nervous, disorders, and, symptoms, that, could, not, be, explained, physiologically, physical, features, however, were, almost, inevitably, present, and, physical, diagnostic, tests, such, as, exaggerated, knee, jerks, loss, of, the, gag, reflex, and, dermatographia, were, used, into, the, 20th, century, french, psychiatrist, phillipe, pinnel, s, nosographie, philosophique, ou, la, m, thode, de, l, analyse, appliqu, e, la, m, decine, 1798, was, greatly, inspired, by, cullen, it, divided, medical, conditions, into, five, categories, with, one, being, neurosis, this, was, divided, into, four, basic, types, of, mental, disorder, melancholia, mania, dementia, and, idiotism, morphine, was, first, isolated, from, opium, in, 1805, by, german, chemist, friedrich, sert, rner, after, the, publication, of, his, third, paper, on, the, topic, in, 1817, morphine, became, more, widely, known, and, used, to, treat, neuroses, and, other, kinds, of, mental, distress, after, becoming, addicted, to, this, highly, addictive, substance, he, warned, i, consider, it, my, duty, to, attract, attention, to, the, terrible, effects, of, this, new, substance, i, called, morphium, in, order, that, calamity, may, be, averted, german, psychologist, johann, friedrich, herbart, used, the, term, repression, in, 1824, in, a, discussion, of, unconscious, ideas, competing, to, get, into, consciousness, the, tranquilising, properties, of, potassium, bromide, were, noted, publicly, by, british, doctor, charles, locock, in, 1857, over, the, coming, decades, this, and, other, bromides, were, used, in, great, quantities, to, calm, people, with, neuroses, this, led, to, many, cases, of, bromism, french, psychiatrist, henri, legrand, du, saulle, used, exposure, therapy, to, treat, phobias, american, doctor, weir, mitchell, first, published, an, account, of, his, rest, cure, for, non, psychotic, mental, disorders, in, 1875, his, 1877, book, fat, and, blood, and, how, to, make, them, gave, a, fuller, explanation, the, cure, originally, involved, women, being, isolated, in, bed, only, communicating, with, a, nurse, trained, to, talk, about, unchallenging, topics, a, fattening, diet, of, milk, plus, massage, and, the, application, of, electricity, eventually, the, cure, advocated, by, the, mitchell, family, had, less, strict, isolation, and, diet, and, was, followed, by, men, as, well, as, women, fat, and, blood, was, revised, and, reprinted, for, many, decades, austrian, psychiatrist, josef, breuer, first, used, psychoanalysis, to, treat, hysteria, in, 1880, 1882, bertha, pappenheim, was, treated, for, a, variety, of, symptoms, that, began, when, her, father, suddenly, fell, seriously, ill, in, mid, 1880, during, a, family, holiday, in, ischl, his, illness, was, a, turning, point, in, her, life, while, sitting, up, at, night, at, his, sickbed, she, was, suddenly, tormented, by, hallucinations, and, a, state, of, anxiety, at, first, the, family, did, not, react, to, these, symptoms, but, in, november, 1880, breuer, a, friend, of, the, family, began, to, treat, her, he, encouraged, her, sometimes, under, light, hypnosis, to, narrate, stories, which, led, to, partial, improvement, of, the, clinical, picture, although, her, overall, condition, continued, to, deteriorate, according, to, breuer, the, slow, and, laborious, progress, of, her, remembering, work, in, which, she, recalled, individual, symptoms, after, they, had, occurred, thus, dissolving, them, came, to, a, conclusion, on, 7, june, 1882, after, she, had, reconstructed, the, first, night, of, hallucinations, in, ischl, she, has, fully, recovered, since, that, time, were, the, words, with, which, breuer, concluded, his, case, report, accounts, differ, on, the, success, of, pappenheim, s, treatment, by, breuer, she, did, not, speak, about, this, episode, in, her, later, life, and, vehemently, opposed, any, attempts, at, psychoanalytic, treatment, of, people, in, her, care, breuer, was, not, quick, to, publish, about, this, case, subsequent, research, has, suggested, pappenheim, may, have, had, one, of, a, number, of, neurological, illnesses, this, includes, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, tuberculous, meningitis, and, encephalitis, whatever, the, nature, of, her, condition, she, went, on, to, run, an, orphanage, and, then, found, and, lead, the, j, discher, frauenbund, for, twenty, years, the, term, psychoneurosis, was, coined, by, scottish, psychiatrist, thomas, clouston, for, his, 1883, book, clinical, lectures, on, mental, diseases, he, describes, a, condition, that, covers, what, is, today, considered, the, schizophrenia, and, autism, spectrums, a, combination, of, symptoms, that, would, soon, become, better, known, as, dementia, praecox, french, neurologist, jean, martin, charcot, came, to, believe, that, psychological, trauma, was, a, cause, of, some, cases, of, hysteria, he, wrote, in, his, book, le, ons, sur, les, maladies, du, syst, me, nerveux, 1885, 1887, and, published, in, english, as, clinical, lectures, on, the, diseases, of, the, nervous, system, quite, recently, male, hysteria, has, been, studied, by, messrs, putnam, and, walton, in, america, principally, as, it, occurs, after, injuries, and, especially, after, railway, accidents, they, have, recognised, like, mr, page, who, in, england, has, also, paid, attention, to, this, subject, that, many, of, those, nervous, accidents, described, under, the, name, of, railway, spine, and, which, according, to, them, would, be, better, described, as, railway, brain, are, in, fact, whether, occurring, in, man, or, woman, simply, manifestations, of, hysteria, charcot, documented, around, two, dozen, cases, where, psychological, trauma, appears, to, have, caused, hysteria, in, some, cases, the, results, are, described, like, the, modern, concept, of, ptsd, austrian, psychiatrist, sigmund, freud, was, a, student, of, charcot, in, 1885, 6, in, 1893, freud, credited, charcot, with, being, the, source, of, all, the, modern, advances, made, in, the, understanding, and, knowledge, of, hysteria, french, psychiatrist, pierre, janet, released, his, book, l, automatisme, psychologique, psychological, automatism, in, 1889, its, third, chapter, detailing, his, understanding, of, hypnosis, and, the, unconscious, at, this, time, he, claimed, that, the, main, aspect, of, psychological, trauma, is, dissociation, a, disconnection, of, the, conscious, mind, from, reality, freud, would, later, claim, janet, as, a, major, influence, in, 1891, thomas, clouston, published, neuroses, of, development, which, covered, a, wide, range, of, physical, and, mental, developmental, conditions, breuer, came, to, mentor, freud, the, pair, released, the, paper, ueber, den, psychischen, mechanismus, hysterischer, ph, nomene, vorl, ufige, mittheilung, known, in, english, as, on, the, physical, mechanism, of, hysterical, phenomena, preliminary, communication, in, january, 1893, it, opens, with, a, chance, observation, has, led, us, over, a, number, of, years, to, investigate, a, great, variety, of, different, forms, and, symptoms, of, hysteria, with, a, view, to, discovering, their, precipitating, cause, the, event, which, provoked, the, first, occurrence, often, many, years, earlier, of, the, phenomenon, in, question, in, the, great, majority, of, cases, it, is, not, possible, to, establish, the, point, of, origin, by, a, simple, interrogation, of, the, patient, however, thoroughly, it, may, be, carried, out, this, is, in, part, because, what, is, in, question, is, often, some, experience, which, the, patient, dislikes, discussing, but, principally, because, he, is, genuinely, unable, to, recollect, it, and, often, has, no, suspicion, of, the, causal, connection, between, the, precipitating, event, and, the, pathological, phenomenon, as, a, rule, it, is, necessary, to, hypnotize, the, patient, and, to, arouse, his, memories, under, hypnosis, of, the, time, at, which, the, symptom, made, its, first, appearance, when, this, has, been, done, it, becomes, possible, to, demonstrate, the, connection, in, the, clearest, and, most, convincing, fashion, it, is, of, course, obvious, that, in, cases, of, traumatic, hysteria, what, provokes, the, symptoms, is, the, accident, the, causal, connection, is, equally, evident, in, hysterical, attacks, when, it, is, possible, to, gather, from, the, patient, s, utterances, that, in, each, attack, he, is, hallucinating, the, same, event, which, provoked, the, first, one, the, situation, is, more, obscure, in, the, case, of, other, phenomena, our, experiences, have, shown, us, however, that, the, most, various, symptoms, which, are, ostensibly, spontaneous, and, as, one, might, say, idiopathic, products, of, hysteria, are, just, as, strictly, related, to, the, precipitating, trauma, as, the, phenomena, to, which, we, have, just, alluded, and, which, exhibit, the, connection, quite, clearly, this, paper, was, reprinted, and, supplemented, with, case, studies, in, the, pair, s, 1895, book, studien, ber, hysterie, studies, on, hysteria, of, the, book, s, five, case, studies, the, most, famous, became, that, of, breuer, s, patient, bertha, pappenheim, given, the, pseudonym, anna, o, this, book, established, the, field, of, psychoanalysis, french, neurologist, paul, oulmont, was, mentored, by, charcot, in, his, 1894, book, th, rapeutique, des, n, vroses, therapy, of, neuroses, he, lists, the, neuroses, as, being, hysteria, neurasthenia, exophthalmic, goitre, epilepsy, migraine, sydenham, s, chorea, parkinson, s, disease, and, tetany, the, fifth, edition, of, german, psychiatrist, emil, kraepelin, s, popular, psychiatry, textbook, in, 1896, gave, neuroses, a, well, accepted, definition, in, the, following, presentation, we, want, to, summarize, a, group, of, disease, states, as, general, neuroses, which, are, accompanied, by, more, or, less, pronounced, nervous, dysfunctions, what, is, common, to, these, manifestations, of, insanity, is, that, we, are, constantly, dealing, with, the, morbid, processing, of, vital, stimuli, what, they, also, have, in, common, is, the, occurrence, of, more, transitory, peculiar, manifestations, of, illness, sometimes, in, the, physical, sometimes, in, the, psychic, area, these, attacks, of, fluctuations, in, mental, balance, are, therefore, not, independent, illnesses, but, only, the, occasional, increase, in, a, persistent, illness, it, seems, useful, to, me, for, the, time, being, to, distinguish, between, two, main, forms, of, general, neuroses, epileptic, and, hysterical, insanity, pierre, janet, published, the, two, volume, work, n, vroses, et, id, es, fixes, neuroses, and, fixations, in, 1898, according, to, janet, neuroses, could, be, usefully, divided, into, hysterias, and, psychasthenias, hysterias, induced, such, symptoms, as, anaesthesia, visual, field, narrowing, paralyses, and, unconscious, acts, psychasthenias, involved, the, ability, to, adjust, to, one, s, surroundings, similar, to, the, later, concepts, of, adjustment, disorder, and, executive, functions, janet, founded, the, french, soci, t, de, psychologie, in, 1901, this, later, became, the, soci, t, fran, aise, de, psychologie, and, continues, today, as, france, s, main, psychology, body, barbiturates, are, a, class, of, highly, addictive, sedative, drugs, the, first, barbiturate, barbital, was, synthesized, in, 1902, by, german, chemists, emil, fischer, and, joseph, von, mering, and, was, first, marketed, as, veronal, in, 1904, the, similar, barbiturate, phenobarbital, was, brought, to, market, in, 1912, under, the, name, luminal, barbiturates, became, popular, drugs, in, many, countries, to, reduce, neurotic, anxiety, and, displaced, the, use, of, bromides, janet, published, the, book, les, obsessions, et, la, psychasth, nie, the, obsessions, and, the, psychasthenias, in, 1903, janet, followed, this, with, the, books, the, major, symptoms, of, hysteria, in, 1907, and, les, n, vroses, the, neuroses, in, 1909, according, to, janet, one, cause, of, neurosis, is, when, the, mental, force, of, a, traumatic, event, is, stronger, than, what, someone, can, counter, using, their, normal, coping, mechanisms, the, swiss, psychiatrist, paul, charles, dubois, published, the, book, les, psychon, vroses, et, leur, traitement, moral, in, 1904, which, was, translated, into, english, as, psychic, treatment, of, nervous, disorders, the, psychoneuroses, and, their, moral, treatment, in, 1905, dubois, believed, that, neurosis, could, be, successfully, treated, by, listening, carefully, to, patients, and, rationally, convincing, them, of, the, truth, what, he, called, rational, psychotherapy, this, was, a, form, of, cognitive, behavioural, therapy, he, also, followed, weir, mitchell, s, rest, cure, though, with, a, broad, fattening, diet, and, other, modifications, meanwhile, freud, developed, a, number, of, different, theories, of, neurosis, the, most, impactful, one, was, that, it, referred, to, mental, disorders, caused, by, the, brain, s, defence, against, past, psychological, trauma, this, redefined, the, general, understanding, and, use, of, the, word, it, came, to, replace, the, concept, of, hysteria, he, held, the, first, congress, for, freudian, psychology, in, salzburg, in, april, 1908, subsequent, congresses, continue, today, progressive, muscle, relaxation, pmr, was, first, developed, by, american, psychiatrist, and, physiologist, edmund, jacobson, this, began, at, harvard, university, in, 1908, pmr, involves, learning, to, relieve, the, tension, in, specific, muscle, groups, by, first, tensing, and, then, relaxing, each, muscle, group, when, the, muscle, tension, is, released, attention, is, directed, towards, the, differences, felt, during, tension, and, relaxation, so, that, the, patient, learns, to, recognize, the, contrast, between, the, states, this, reduces, anxiety, and, the, effect, of, phobias, freud, published, the, detailed, case, study, bemerkungen, ber, einen, fall, von, zwangsneurose, notes, upon, a, case, of, obsessional, neurosis, in, 1909, documenting, his, treatment, of, rat, man, freud, established, the, international, psychoanalytical, association, ipa, in, march, 1910, he, arranged, for, carl, jung, to, be, its, first, president, this, organisation, chose, to, only, provide, both, psychoanalytic, training, and, recognition, to, medical, doctors, the, american, psychoanalytic, association, was, founded, in, 1911, by, welsh, neurologist, ernest, jones, with, the, support, of, freud, it, followed, the, ipa, s, practice, of, only, supporting, psychoanalysis, provided, by, medical, doctors, jung, gave, a, speech, explaining, his, understanding, of, freud, s, work, called, psychoanalysis, and, neurosis, in, new, york, in, 1912, it, was, published, in, 1916, the, journal, internationale, zeitschrift, f, r, psychoanalyse, was, established, in, 1913, and, continued, until, 1941, the, battlefield, stresses, of, world, war, i, 1914, 18, lead, to, many, cases, of, strong, short, term, psychological, symptoms, known, today, as, combat, stress, reaction, csr, other, terms, for, the, condition, include, combat, fatigue, battle, fatigue, battle, neurosis, shell, shock, and, operational, stress, reaction, the, general, psychological, term, acute, stress, disorder, was, first, used, for, this, condition, at, this, time, the, fight, or, flight, response, was, first, described, by, american, physiologist, walter, bradford, cannon, in, 1915, american, military, psychiatrist, thomas, w, salmon, the, chief, consultant, in, psychiatry, in, the, american, expeditionary, force, released, the, book, the, care, and, treatment, of, mental, diseases, and, war, neuroses, shell, shock, in, the, british, army, in, 1917, dealing, primarily, with, what, was, considered, was, the, best, treatment, for, hysteria, his, recommendations, were, broadly, adopted, in, the, us, armed, forces, freud, s, most, explanatory, work, on, neurosis, was, his, lectures, later, grouped, together, as, general, theory, of, the, neuroses, 1916, 17, forming, part, 3, of, the, book, vorlesungen, zur, einf, hrung, in, die, psychoanalyse, 1917, later, published, in, english, as, a, general, introduction, to, psychoanalysis, 1920, in, that, work, freud, noted, that, the, meaning, of, neurotic, symptoms, was, first, discovered, by, j, breuer, in, the, study, and, felicitous, cure, of, a, case, of, hysteria, which, has, since, become, famous, 1880, 82, it, is, true, that, p, janet, independently, reached, the, same, result, the, symptom, develops, as, a, substitution, for, something, else, that, has, remained, suppressed, certain, psychological, experiences, should, normally, have, become, so, far, elaborated, that, consciousness, would, have, attained, knowledge, of, them, this, did, not, take, place, however, but, out, of, these, interrupted, and, disturbed, processes, imprisoned, in, the, unconscious, the, symptom, arose, our, therapy, does, its, work, by, means, of, changing, the, unconscious, into, the, conscious, and, is, effective, only, in, so, far, as, it, has, the, opportunity, of, bringing, about, this, transformation, freud, added, to, this, with, his, paper, aus, der, geschichte, einer, infantilen, neurose, from, the, history, of, an, infantile, neurosis, published, in, 1918, which, is, a, detailed, case, study, of, his, treatment, of, the, wolfman, the, international, journal, of, psychoanalysis, was, founded, by, ernest, jones, in, 1920, in, response, to, stress, injuries, from, world, war, i, the, british, government, produced, the, report, of, the, war, office, committee, of, inquiry, into, shell, shock, which, was, published, in, 1922, its, recommended, course, of, treatment, included, while, recognizing, that, each, individual, case, of, war, neurosis, must, be, treated, on, its, merits, the, committee, are, of, opinion, that, good, results, will, be, obtained, in, the, majority, by, the, simplest, forms, of, psycho, therapy, i, e, explanation, persuasion, and, suggestion, aided, by, such, physical, methods, as, baths, electricity, and, massage, rest, of, mind, and, body, is, essential, in, all, cases, the, committee, are, of, opinion, that, the, production, of, deep, hypnotic, sleep, while, beneficial, as, a, means, of, conveying, suggestions, or, eliciting, forgotten, experiences, are, useful, in, selected, cases, but, in, the, majority, they, are, unnecessary, and, may, even, aggravate, the, symptoms, for, a, time, they, do, not, recommend, psycho, analysis, in, the, freudian, sense, in, the, state, of, convalescence, re, education, and, suitable, occupation, of, an, interesting, nature, are, of, great, importance, if, the, patient, is, unfit, for, further, military, service, it, is, considered, that, every, endeavor, should, be, made, to, obtain, for, him, suitable, employment, on, his, return, to, active, life, the, common, neuroses, and, their, treatment, by, psychotherapy, was, a, book, released, by, british, psychiatrist, thomas, arthur, ross, in, 1923, to, instruct, medical, doctors, in, general, a, second, edition, was, published, in, 1937, which, was, subsequently, reprinted, many, times, he, also, followed, the, practice, of, paul, charles, dubois, and, believed, freudian, analysis, was, only, necessary, for, the, most, difficult, cases, ross, would, later, write, the, books, introduction, to, analytical, psychotherapy, 1932, and, an, enquiry, into, prognosis, in, the, neuroses, 1936, in, april, 1923, freud, published, his, monograph, das, ich, und, das, es, published, in, english, as, the, ego, and, the, id, which, included, a, revised, theory, of, mental, functioning, now, considering, that, repression, was, only, one, of, many, defence, mechanisms, and, that, it, occurred, to, reduce, anxiety, hence, freud, characterised, repression, as, both, a, cause, and, a, result, of, anxiety, austrian, literary, theorist, otto, rank, was, a, close, ally, of, freud, his, book, the, trauma, of, birth, 1924, focused, more, on, people, s, choices, rather, than, freud, s, focus, on, drives, he, believed, in, the, idea, of, psychotherapy, as, opposed, to, psychoanalysis, that, understanding, someone, s, neuroses, wasn, t, sufficient, for, effective, therapy, freud, released, his, book, hemmung, symptom, und, angst, inhibition, symptom, and, anxiety, in, 1926, in, reaction, to, rank, s, book, it, detailed, his, further, developed, understanding, of, neurosis, and, anxiety, the, book, was, published, in, english, as, the, problem, of, anxiety, in, 1936, this, book, expressed, his, new, view, that, anxiety, created, repression, rather, than, the, other, way, around, freud, also, published, the, book, die, frage, der, laienanalyse, the, question, of, lay, analysis, in, 1926, in, which, he, endorsed, non, doctors, performing, psychoanalysis, in, 1929, austrian, psychiatrist, alfred, adler, published, the, book, problems, of, neurosis, a, book, of, case, histories, furthering, the,

people, with, conditions, that, fitted, between, the, definitions, of, psychoneurosis, and, psychosis, and, called, them, the, border, line, group, of, neuroses, this, group, would, later, become, known, as, borderline, personality, disorder, by, 1937, the, concept, of, occupational, neuroses, was, known, by, many, american, health, practitioners, it, referred, to, neuroses, caused, by, any, aspect, of, someone, s, employment, followers, of, freud, s, psychoanalytic, thinking, such, as, carl, jung, karen, horney, and, jacques, lacan, continued, to, discuss, the, concept, of, neurosis,

accordingly, the, majority, of, his, patients, consisted, not, of, believers, but, of, those, who, had, lost, their, faith, 140, a, contemporary, person, according, to, jung, is, blind, to, the, fact, that, with, all, his, rationality, and, efficiency, he, is, possessed, by, powers, that, are, beyond, his, control, his, gods, and, demons, have, not, disappeared, at, all, they, have, merely, got,

origin, and, dynamics, of, neurosis, in, her, theory, neurosis, is, a, distorted, way, of, looking, at, the, world, and, at, oneself, which, is, determined, by, compulsive, needs, rather, than, by, a, genuine, interest, in, the, world, as, it, is, horney, proposes, that, neurosis, is, transmitted, to, a, child, from, their, early, environment, and, that, there, are, many, ways, in, which, this, can, occur, 18, when, summarized, they, all, boil, down, to, the, fact, that, the, people, in, the, environment, are, too, wrapped, up, in, their, own, neuroses, to, be, able, to, love, the, child, or, even, to, conceive, of, him, as, the, particular, individual, he, is, their, attitudes, toward, him, are, determined, by, their, own, neurotic, needs, and, responses, the, child, s, initial, reality, is, then, distorted, by, their, parents, needs, and, pretenses, growing, up, with, neurotic, caretakers, the, child, quickly, becomes, insecure, and, develops, basic, anxiety, to, deal, with,
