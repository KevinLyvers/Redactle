sea, snakes, or, coral, reef, snakes, are, elapid, snakes, that, inhabit, marine, environments, for, most, or, all, of, their, lives, they, belong, to, two, subfamilies, hydrophiinae, and, laticaudinae, hydrophiinae, also, includes, australasian, terrestrial, snakes, whereas, laticaudinae, only, includes, the, sea, kraits, laticauda, of, which, three, species, are, found, exclusively, in, freshwater, if, these, three, freshwater, species, are, excluded, there, are, 69, species, of, sea, snakes, divided, among, seven, genera, most, sea, snakes, are, venomous, except, the, genus, emydocephalus, which, feeds, almost, exclusively, on, fish, eggs, sea, snakes, are, extensively, adapted, to, a, fully, aquatic, life, and, are, unable, to, move, on, land, except, for, the, sea, kraits, which, have, limited, land, movement, they, are, found, in, warm, coastal, waters, from, the, indian, ocean, to, the, pacific, and, are, closely, related, to, venomous, terrestrial, snakes, in, australia, all, sea, snakes, have, paddle, like, tails, and, many, have, laterally, compressed, bodies, that, give, them, an, eel, like, appearance, unlike, fish, they, do, not, have, gills, and, must, surface, regularly, to, breathe, along, with, cetaceans, they, are, among, the, most, completely, aquatic, of, all, extant, air, breathing, vertebrates, among, this, group, are, species, with, some, of, the, most, potent, venoms, of, all, snakes, some, have, gentle, dispositions, and, bite, only, when, provoked, while, others, are, much, more, aggressive, the, majority, of, adult, sea, snakes, species, grow, to, between, 120, and, 150, cm, 4, and, 5, ft, in, length, with, the, largest, hydrophis, spiralis, reaching, a, maximum, of, 3, m, 10, ft, their, eyes, are, relatively, small, with, a, round, pupil, and, most, have, nostrils, located, dorsally, the, skulls, do, not, differ, significantly, from, those, of, terrestrial, elapids, although, their, dentition, is, relatively, primitive, with, short, fangs, and, with, the, exception, of, emydocephalus, as, many, as, 18, smaller, teeth, behind, them, on, the, maxilla, most, sea, snakes, are, completely, aquatic, and, have, adapted, to, sea, environments, in, many, ways, the, most, characteristic, of, which, is, a, paddle, like, tail, that, has, improved, their, swimming, ability, to, a, varying, degree, the, bodies, of, many, species, are, laterally, compressed, especially, in, the, pelagic, species, this, has, often, caused, the, ventral, scales, to, become, reduced, in, size, even, difficult, to, distinguish, from, the, adjoining, scales, their, lack, of, ventral, scales, means, they, have, become, virtually, helpless, on, land, but, as, they, live, out, their, entire, lifecycles, at, sea, they, have, no, need, to, leave, the, water, the, only, genus, that, has, retained, the, enlarged, ventral, scales, is, the, sea, kraits, laticauda, with, only, five, species, these, snakes, are, considered, to, be, more, primitive, as, they, still, spend, much, of, their, time, on, land, where, their, ventral, scales, afford, them, the, necessary, grip, laticauda, species, are, also, the, only, sea, snakes, with, internasal, scales, that, is, their, nostrils, are, not, located, dorsally, since, a, snake, s, tongue, can, fulfill, its, olfactory, function, more, easily, under, water, its, action, is, short, compared, to, that, of, terrestrial, snake, species, only, the, forked, tips, protrude, from, the, mouth, through, a, divided, notch, in, the, middle, of, the, rostral, scale, the, nostrils, have, valves, consisting, of, a, specialized, spongy, tissue, to, exclude, water, and, the, windpipe, can, be, drawn, up, to, where, the, short, nasal, passage, opens, into, the, roof, of, the, mouth, this, is, an, important, adaptation, for, an, animal, that, must, surface, to, breathe, but, may, have, its, head, partially, submerged, when, doing, so, the, lung, has, become, very, large, and, extends, almost, the, entire, length, of, the, body, although, the, rear, portion, is, thought, to, have, developed, to, aid, buoyancy, rather, than, to, exchange, gases, the, extended, lung, possibly, also, serves, to, store, air, for, dives, most, species, of, sea, snakes, are, able, to, respire, through, the, top, of, their, skin, this, is, unusual, for, reptiles, because, their, skin, is, thick, and, scaly, but, experiments, with, the, black, and, yellow, sea, snake, hydrophis, platurus, a, pelagic, species, have, shown, this, species, can, satisfy, about, 25, of, its, oxygen, requirements, in, this, manner, which, allows, for, prolonged, dives, like, other, land, animals, that, have, adapted, to, life, in, a, marine, environment, sea, snakes, ingest, considerably, more, salt, than, their, terrestrial, relatives, through, their, diets, and, when, seawater, is, inadvertently, swallowed, because, of, this, a, more, effective, means, of, regulating, the, salt, concentration, of, their, blood, is, required, in, sea, snakes, the, posterior, sublingual, glands, located, under, and, around, the, tongue, sheath, allow, them, to, expel, salt, with, their, tongue, action, scalation, among, sea, snakes, is, highly, variable, as, opposed, to, terrestrial, snake, species, that, have, imbricate, scales, to, protect, against, abrasion, the, scales, of, most, pelagic, sea, snakes, do, not, overlap, reef, dwelling, species, such, as, aipysurus, do, have, imbricate, scales, to, protect, against, the, sharp, coral, the, scales, themselves, may, be, smooth, keeled, spiny, or, granular, the, latter, often, looking, like, warts, pelamis, has, body, scales, that, are, peg, like, while, those, on, its, tail, are, juxtaposed, hexagonal, plates, vision, chemoreception, tongue, flicking, and, hearing, are, important, senses, for, terrestrial, snakes, but, these, stimuli, become, distorted, in, water, the, poor, visibility, chemical, dilution, and, limitation, of, ground, borne, vibrations, under, water, suggest, that, sea, snakes, and, sea, kraits, may, have, unique, sensory, abilities, to, compensate, for, the, relative, lack, of, other, sensory, cues, relatively, little, is, known, about, sea, snake, vision, a, study, of, photoreceptors, in, the, retina, of, spine, bellied, lapemis, curtus, and, horned, acalyptophis, peronii, sea, snakes, found, three, classes, of, opsins, all, from, cone, cells, despite, the, absence, of, rod, cells, in, sea, snake, eyes, simeos, et, al, found, the, rhodopsin, rh1, the, opsin, of, the, rods, still, expressed, suggesting, that, in, sea, snakes, some, cones, may, be, transmuted, rods, behavioural, observations, indicate, that, vision, has, a, limited, role, for, catching, prey, and, mate, selection, but, sound, vibrations, and, chemoreception, may, be, important, one, study, identified, small, sensory, organs, on, the, head, of, lapemis, curtus, similar, to, the, mechanoreceptors, in, alligators, and, aquatic, snake, acrochodus, that, are, used, to, sense, the, movement, of, fish, prey, westhoff, et, al, recorded, auditory, brain, responses, to, vibration, underwater, in, lapemis, curtus, which, are, sensitive, enough, to, detect, movement, in, prey, but, were, not, as, sensitive, as, fish, lateral, line, systems, similarly, vision, appears, to, be, of, limited, importance, for, finding, mates, shine, experimented, with, applying, skin, secretions, pheromones, to, snake, like, objects, to, see, if, male, turtle, headed, sea, snakes, emydocephalus, annulatus, are, attracted, to, female, pheromones, shine, found, that, although, vision, may, be, useful, over, short, distances, less, than, 1, m, pheromones, are, more, important, once, the, male, comes, in, physical, contact, with, an, object, the, olive, sea, snake, aipysurus, laevis, has, been, found, to, have, photoreceptors, in, the, skin, of, its, tail, allowing, it, to, detect, light, and, presumably, ensuring, it, is, completely, hidden, including, its, tail, inside, coral, holes, during, the, day, while, other, species, have, not, been, tested, a, laevis, possibly, is, not, unique, among, sea, snakes, in, this, respect, other, unique, senses, such, as, electromagnetic, reception, and, pressure, detection, have, been, proposed, for, sea, snakes, but, scientific, studies, have, yet, to, be, performed, to, test, these, senses, sea, snakes, are, mostly, confined, to, the, warm, tropical, waters, of, the, indian, ocean, and, the, western, pacific, ocean, with, a, few, species, found, well, out, into, oceania, the, geographic, range, of, one, species, pelamis, platurus, is, wider, than, that, of, any, other, reptile, species, except, for, a, few, species, of, sea, turtles, it, extends, from, the, east, coast, of, africa, from, djibouti, in, the, north, to, cape, town, in, the, south, across, the, indian, ocean, the, pacific, south, as, far, as, the, northern, coast, of, new, zealand, all, the, way, to, the, western, coast, of, the, americas, where, it, occurs, from, northern, peru, in, the, south, including, the, gal, pagos, islands, to, the, gulf, of, california, in, the, north, isolated, specimens, have, been, found, as, far, north, as, san, diego, and, oxnard, in, the, united, states, sea, snakes, do, not, occur, in, the, atlantic, ocean, pelamis, possibly, would, be, found, there, were, it, not, for, the, cold, currents, off, namibia, and, western, south, africa, that, keep, it, from, crossing, into, the, eastern, south, atlantic, or, south, of, 5, s, latitude, along, the, south, american, west, coast, sea, snakes, do, not, occur, in, the, red, sea, believed, to, be, due, to, its, increased, salinity, so, no, danger, exists, of, them, crossing, through, the, suez, canal, a, lack, of, salinity, is, also, thought, to, be, the, reason, why, pelamis, has, not, crossed, into, the, caribbean, via, the, panama, canal, despite, their, marine, adaptations, most, sea, snakes, prefer, shallow, waters, near, land, around, islands, and, especially, somewhat, sheltered, waters, as, well, as, near, estuaries, they, may, swim, up, rivers, and, have, been, reported, as, far, as, 160, km, 100, mi, from, the, sea, others, such, as, p, platurus, are, pelagic, and, are, found, in, drift, lines, slicks, of, floating, debris, brought, together, by, surface, currents, some, sea, snakes, inhabit, mangrove, swamps, and, similar, brackishwater, habitats, and, two, landlocked, freshwater, forms, are, found, hydrophis, semperi, occurs, in, lake, taal, in, the, philippines, and, laticauda, crockeri, in, lake, te, nggano, on, rennell, island, in, the, solomon, islands, sea, snakes, are, generally, reluctant, to, bite, and, are, usually, considered, to, be, mild, tempered, although, variation, is, seen, among, species, and, individuals, some, species, such, as, p, platurus, which, feed, by, simply, gulping, down, their, prey, are, more, likely, to, bite, when, provoked, because, they, seem, to, use, their, venom, more, for, defense, others, such, as, laticauda, spp, use, their, venom, for, prey, immobilization, sea, snakes, are, often, handled, without, concern, by, local, fishermen, who, unravel, and, toss, them, back, into, the, water, barehanded, usually, without, getting, bitten, when, the, snakes, frequently, become, entangled, in, fishing, nets, species, reported, as, much, more, aggressive, include, aipysurus, laevis, astrotia, stokesii, enhydrina, schistosa, enhydrina, zweifeli, and, hydrophis, ornatus, on, land, their, movements, become, very, erratic, they, crawl, awkwardly, in, these, situations, and, can, become, quite, aggressive, striking, wildly, at, anything, that, moves, although, they, are, unable, to, coil, and, strike, in, the, manner, of, terrestrial, snakes, sea, snakes, appear, to, be, active, both, day, and, night, in, the, morning, and, sometimes, late, in, the, afternoon, they, can, be, seen, at, the, surface, basking, in, the, sunlight, and, they, dive, when, disturbed, they, have, been, reported, swimming, at, depths, over, 90, m, 300, ft, and, can, remain, submerged, for, as, long, as, a, few, hours, possibly, depending, on, temperature, and, degree, of, activity, sea, snakes, have, been, sighted, in, huge, numbers, for, example, in, 1932, a, steamer, in, the, strait, of, malacca, off, the, coast, of, malaysia, reported, sighting, millions, of, astrotia, stokesii, a, relative, of, pelamis, these, reportedly, formed, a, line, of, snakes, 3, m, 10, ft, wide, and, 100, km, 60, mi, long, the, cause, of, this, phenomenon, is, unknown, although, it, likely, has, to, do, with, reproduction, they, can, sometimes, be, seen, swimming, in, schools, of, several, hundred, and, many, dead, specimens, have, been, found, on, beaches, after, typhoons, they, feed, on, small, fish, and, occasionally, young, octopus, they, are, often, associated, with, the, sea, snake, barnacle, platylepas, ophiophila, which, attaches, to, their, skin, except, for, a, single, genus, all, sea, snakes, are, ovoviviparous, the, young, are, born, alive, in, the, water, where, they, live, their, entire, lives, in, some, species, the, young, are, quite, large, up, to, half, as, long, as, the, mother, the, one, exception, is, the, genus, laticauda, which, is, oviparous, its, five, species, all, lay, their, eggs, on, land, like, their, relatives, in, the, family, elapidae, the, majority, of, sea, snakes, are, highly, venomous, they, rarely, inject, their, venom, when, biting, so, venomous, bites, to, humans, are, rare, for, example, hydrophis, platurus, has, a, venom, more, potent, than, any, terrestrial, snake, species, in, costa, rica, based, on, ld, 50, but, despite, its, abundance, in, the, waters, off, its, western, coast, few, human, fatalities, have, been, reported, the, death, of, a, trawler, fisherman, in, australian, waters, during, 2018, was, reported, to, be, the, region, s, first, sea, snake, fatality, since, a, pearl, diver, was, killed, in, 1935, bites, in, which, envenomation, does, occur, are, usually, painless, and, may, not, even, be, noticed, when, contact, is, made, teeth, may, remain, in, the, wound, usually, little, or, no, swelling, occurs, and, rarely, are, any, nearby, lymph, nodes, affected, the, most, important, symptoms, are, rhabdomyolysis, rapid, breakdown, of, skeletal, muscle, tissue, and, paralysis, early, symptoms, include, headache, a, thick, feeling, tongue, thirst, sweating, and, vomiting, the, venom, is, very, slow, acting, and, symptoms, that, happen, from, little, as, 30, minutes, to, several, hours, after, the, bite, include, generalized, aching, stiffness, and, tenderness, of, muscles, all, over, the, body, passive, stretching, of, the, muscles, is, also, painful, and, trismus, which, is, similar, to, tetanus, is, common, this, is, followed, later, on, by, symptoms, typical, of, other, elapid, envenomations, a, progressive, flaccid, paralysis, starting, with, ptosis, and, paralysis, of, voluntary, muscles, paralysis, of, muscles, involved, in, swallowing, and, respiration, can, be, fatal, vick, et, al, 1975, estimated, that, the, ld, 50, of, three, sea, snake, venoms, h, platurus, l, semifasciata, and, l, laticaudata, for, a, 70, kg, human, range, from, 7, 7, to, 21, mg, data, from, the, only, sea, snake, venom, conducted, in, monkeys, at, that, time, suggested, that, primates, were, slightly, more, resistant, to, the, venom, effects, on, a, dose, response, basis, than, mice, ishikawa, et, al, 1985, indicated, a, substantially, lower, binding, affinity, between, sea, snake, neurotoxin, and, human, and, chimpanzee, achr, s, compared, to, that, in, other, animals, in, humans, the, venom, targets, appear, mainly, to, be, the, cell, walls, of, voluntary, skeletal, muscles, and, distal, tubular, portions, of, the, kidney, including, the, loop, of, henle, the, second, convoluted, tubule, and, the, collecting, tubules, sitprija, et, al, 1973, found, evidence, of, tubular, necrosis, throughout, all, portions, of, the, renal, tubules, in, two, patients, severely, envenomated, by, sea, snakes, sea, snake, venoms, in, humans, are, thus, more, often, myotoxic, and, or, nephrotoxic, rather, than, neurotoxic, cobra, laticauda, notechis, emydocephalus, aipysurus, hydrelaps, hydrophis, sea, snakes, were, at, first, regarded, as, a, unified, and, separate, family, the, hydrophiidae, that, later, came, to, comprise, two, subfamilies, the, hydrophiinae, or, true, aquatic, sea, snakes, now, 6, genera, with, 64, species, and, the, more, primitive, laticaudinae, or, sea, kraits, one, genus, laticauda, with, eight, species, eventually, as, just, how, closely, related, the, sea, snakes, are, to, the, elapids, became, clear, the, taxonomic, situation, became, less, well, defined, some, taxonomists, responded, by, moving, the, sea, snakes, to, the, elapidae, most, taxonomists, now, place, the, sea, snakes, in, the, elapid, subfamilies, hydrophiinae, and, laticaudinae, although, the, latter, may, be, omitted, if, laticauda, is, included, in, the, hydrophiinae, unlike, the, traditional, hydrophiinae, the, hydrophiinae, as, currently, seen, also, includes, australasian, terrestrial, elapids, molecular, data, studies, suggest, all, three, monotypic, semiaquatic, genera, ephalophis, parahydrophis, and, hydrelaps, are, early, diverging, lineages, at, best, sea, snakes, make, difficult, captives, ditmars, 1933, described, them, as, nervous, and, delicate, captives, that, usually, refuse, to, eat, preferring, only, to, hide, in, the, darkest, corner, of, the, tank, over, 50, years, later, mehrtens, wrote, in, 1987, that, although, they, were, rarely, displayed, in, western, zoological, parks, some, species, were, regularly, on, display, in, japanese, aquariums, the, available, food, supply, limits, the, number, of, species, that, can, be, kept, in, captivity, since, some, have, diets, that, are, too, specialized, also, some, species, appear, intolerant, of, handling, or, even, being, removed, from, the, water, regarding, their, requirements, in, captivity, the, laticauda, species, need, to, be, able, to, exit, the, water, somewhere, at, about, 29, c, 84, f, along, with, a, submerged, shelter, species, that, have, done, relatively, well, in, captivity, include, the, ringed, sea, snake, hydrophis, cyanocinctus, which, feeds, on, fish, and, eels, in, particular, pelamis, platurus, has, done, especially, well, in, captivity, accepting, small, fish, including, goldfish, housing, them, in, round, tanks, or, in, rectangular, tanks, with, well, rounded, corners, prevents, snakes, from, damaging, their, snouts, on, the, sides, most, sea, snakes, are, not, on, the, cites, protection, lists, one, species, laticauda, crockeri, is, classified, as, vulnerable, several, species, of, aipysurus, are, listed, with, conservation, status, of, greater, concern, the, timor, species, a, fuscus, is, known, to, be, endangered, and, two, others, found, in, seas, north, of, australia, the, leaf, scaled, a, foliosquama, and, short, nosed, a, apraefrontalis, are, classified, as, critically, endangered, according, to, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species
