in, biology, cell, signaling, cell, signalling, in, british, english, is, the, process, by, which, a, cell, interacts, with, itself, other, cells, and, the, environment, cell, signaling, is, a, fundamental, property, of, all, cellular, life, in, prokaryotes, and, eukaryotes, typically, the, signaling, process, involves, three, components, the, signal, the, receptor, and, the, effector, in, biology, signals, are, mostly, chemical, in, nature, but, can, also, be, physical, cues, such, as, pressure, voltage, temperature, or, light, chemical, signals, are, molecules, with, the, ability, to, bind, and, activate, a, specific, receptor, these, molecules, also, referred, as, ligands, are, chemically, diverse, including, ions, e, g, na, k, ca, etc, lipids, e, g, steroid, prostaglandin, peptides, e, g, insulin, acth, carbohydrates, glycosylated, proteins, proteoglycans, nucleic, acids, etc, peptide, and, lipid, ligands, are, particularly, important, as, most, hormones, belong, to, these, classes, of, chemicals, peptides, are, usually, polar, hydrophilic, molecules, as, such, they, are, unable, to, diffuse, freely, across, the, bi, lipid, layer, of, the, plasma, membrane, so, their, action, is, mediated, by, a, cell, membrane, bound, receptor, on, the, other, hand, liposoluble, chemicals, such, as, steroid, hormones, can, diffuse, passively, across, the, plasma, membrane, and, interact, with, intracellular, receptors, cell, signaling, can, occur, over, short, or, long, distances, and, can, be, further, classified, as, autocrine, intracrine, juxtacrine, paracrine, or, endocrine, autocrine, signaling, occurs, when, the, chemical, signal, acts, on, the, same, cell, that, produced, the, signaling, chemical, intracrine, signaling, occurs, when, the, chemical, signal, produced, by, a, cell, acts, on, receptors, located, in, the, cytoplasm, or, nucleus, of, the, same, cell, juxtacrine, signaling, occurs, between, physically, adjacent, cells, paracrine, signaling, occurs, between, nearby, cells, endocrine, interaction, occurs, between, distant, cells, with, the, chemical, signal, usually, carried, by, the, blood, receptors, are, complex, proteins, or, tightly, bound, multimer, of, proteins, located, in, the, plasma, membrane, or, within, the, interior, of, the, cell, such, as, in, the, cytoplasm, organelles, and, nucleus, receptors, have, the, ability, to, detect, a, signal, either, by, binding, to, a, specific, chemical, or, by, undergoing, a, conformational, change, when, interacting, with, physical, agents, it, is, the, specificity, of, the, chemical, interaction, between, a, given, ligand, and, its, receptor, that, confers, the, ability, to, trigger, a, specific, cellular, response, receptors, can, be, broadly, classified, into, cell, membrane, receptors, and, intracellular, receptors, cell, membrane, receptors, can, be, further, classified, into, ion, channel, linked, receptors, g, protein, coupled, receptors, and, enzyme, linked, receptors, ion, channels, receptors, are, large, transmembrane, proteins, with, a, ligand, activated, gate, function, when, these, receptors, are, activated, they, may, allow, or, block, passage, of, specific, ions, across, the, cell, membrane, most, receptors, activated, by, physical, stimuli, such, as, pressure, or, temperature, belongs, to, this, category, g, protein, receptors, are, multimeric, proteins, embedded, within, the, plasma, membrane, these, receptors, have, extracellular, trans, membrane, and, intracellular, domains, the, extracellular, domain, is, responsible, for, the, interaction, with, a, specific, ligand, the, intracellular, domain, is, responsible, for, the, initiation, of, a, cascade, of, chemical, reactions, which, ultimately, triggers, the, specific, cellular, function, controlled, by, the, receptor, enzyme, linked, receptors, are, transmembrane, proteins, with, an, extracellular, domain, responsible, for, binding, a, specific, ligand, and, an, intracellular, domain, with, enzymatic, or, catalytic, activity, upon, activation, the, enzymatic, portion, is, responsible, for, promoting, specific, intracellular, chemical, reactions, intracellular, receptors, have, a, different, mechanism, of, action, they, usually, bind, to, lipid, soluble, ligands, that, diffuse, passively, through, the, plasma, membrane, such, as, steroid, hormones, these, ligands, bind, to, specific, cytoplasmic, transporters, that, shuttle, the, hormone, transporter, complex, inside, the, nucleus, where, specific, genes, are, activated, and, the, synthesis, of, specific, proteins, is, promoted, the, effector, component, of, the, signaling, pathway, begins, with, signal, transduction, in, this, process, the, signal, by, interacting, with, the, receptor, starts, a, series, of, molecular, events, within, the, cell, leading, to, the, final, effect, of, the, signaling, process, typically, the, final, effect, consists, in, the, activation, of, an, ion, channel, ligand, gated, ion, channel, or, the, initiation, of, a, second, messenger, system, cascade, that, propagates, the, signal, through, the, cell, second, messenger, systems, can, amplify, or, modulate, a, signal, in, which, activation, of, a, few, receptors, results, in, multiple, secondary, messengers, being, activated, thereby, amplifying, the, initial, signal, the, first, messenger, the, downstream, effects, of, these, signaling, pathways, may, include, additional, enzymatic, activities, such, as, proteolytic, cleavage, phosphorylation, methylation, and, ubiquitinylation, signaling, molecules, can, be, synthesized, from, various, biosynthetic, pathways, and, released, through, passive, or, active, transports, or, even, from, cell, damage, each, cell, is, programmed, to, respond, to, specific, extracellular, signal, molecules, and, is, the, basis, of, development, tissue, repair, immunity, and, homeostasis, errors, in, signaling, interactions, may, cause, diseases, such, as, cancer, autoimmunity, and, diabetes, in, many, small, organisms, such, as, bacteria, quorum, sensing, enables, individuals, to, begin, an, activity, only, when, the, population, is, sufficiently, large, this, signaling, between, cells, was, first, observed, in, the, marine, bacterium, aliivibrio, fischeri, which, produces, light, when, the, population, is, dense, enough, the, mechanism, involves, the, production, and, detection, of, a, signaling, molecule, and, the, regulation, of, gene, transcription, in, response, quorum, sensing, operates, in, both, gram, positive, and, gram, negative, bacteria, and, both, within, and, between, species, in, slime, molds, individual, cells, aggregate, together, to, form, fruiting, bodies, and, eventually, spores, under, the, influence, of, a, chemical, signal, known, as, an, acrasin, the, individuals, move, by, chemotaxis, i, e, they, are, attracted, by, the, chemical, gradient, some, species, use, cyclic, amp, as, the, signal, others, such, as, polysphondylium, violaceum, use, a, dipeptide, known, as, glorin, in, plants, and, animals, signaling, between, cells, occurs, either, through, release, into, the, extracellular, space, divided, in, paracrine, signaling, over, short, distances, and, endocrine, signaling, over, long, distances, or, by, direct, contact, known, as, juxtacrine, signaling, such, as, notch, signaling, autocrine, signaling, is, a, special, case, of, paracrine, signaling, where, the, secreting, cell, has, the, ability, to, respond, to, the, secreted, signaling, molecule, synaptic, signaling, is, a, special, case, of, paracrine, signaling, for, chemical, synapses, or, juxtacrine, signaling, for, electrical, synapses, between, neurons, and, target, cells, many, cell, signals, are, carried, by, molecules, that, are, released, by, one, cell, and, move, to, make, contact, with, another, cell, signaling, molecules, can, belong, to, several, chemical, classes, lipids, phospholipids, amino, acids, monoamines, proteins, glycoproteins, or, gases, signaling, molecules, binding, surface, receptors, are, generally, large, and, hydrophilic, e, g, trh, vasopressin, acetylcholine, while, those, entering, the, cell, are, generally, small, and, hydrophobic, e, g, glucocorticoids, thyroid, hormones, cholecalciferol, retinoic, acid, but, important, exceptions, to, both, are, numerous, and, the, same, molecule, can, act, both, via, surface, receptors, or, in, an, intracrine, manner, to, different, effects, in, animal, cells, specialized, cells, release, these, hormones, and, send, them, through, the, circulatory, system, to, other, parts, of, the, body, they, then, reach, target, cells, which, can, recognize, and, respond, to, the, hormones, and, produce, a, result, this, is, also, known, as, endocrine, signaling, plant, growth, regulators, or, plant, hormones, move, through, cells, or, by, diffusing, through, the, air, as, a, gas, to, reach, their, targets, hydrogen, sulfide, is, produced, in, small, amounts, by, some, cells, of, the, human, body, and, has, a, number, of, biological, signaling, functions, only, two, other, such, gases, are, currently, known, to, act, as, signaling, molecules, in, the, human, body, nitric, oxide, and, carbon, monoxide, exocytosis, is, the, process, by, which, a, cell, transports, molecules, such, as, neurotransmitters, and, proteins, out, of, the, cell, as, an, active, transport, mechanism, exocytosis, requires, the, use, of, energy, to, transport, material, exocytosis, and, its, counterpart, endocytosis, the, process, that, brings, substances, into, the, cell, are, used, by, all, cells, because, most, chemical, substances, important, to, them, are, large, polar, molecules, that, cannot, pass, through, the, hydrophobic, portion, of, the, cell, membrane, by, passive, transport, exocytosis, is, the, process, by, which, a, large, amount, of, molecules, are, released, thus, it, is, a, form, of, bulk, transport, exocytosis, occurs, via, secretory, portals, at, the, cell, plasma, membrane, called, porosomes, porosomes, are, permanent, cup, shaped, lipoprotein, structures, at, the, cell, plasma, membrane, where, secretory, vesicles, transiently, dock, and, fuse, to, release, intra, vesicular, contents, from, the, cell, in, exocytosis, membrane, bound, secretory, vesicles, are, carried, to, the, cell, membrane, where, they, dock, and, fuse, at, porosomes, and, their, contents, i, e, water, soluble, molecules, are, secreted, into, the, extracellular, environment, this, secretion, is, possible, because, the, vesicle, transiently, fuses, with, the, plasma, membrane, in, the, context, of, neurotransmission, neurotransmitters, are, typically, released, from, synaptic, vesicles, into, the, synaptic, cleft, via, exocytosis, however, neurotransmitters, can, also, be, released, via, reverse, transport, through, membrane, transport, proteins, autocrine, signaling, involves, a, cell, secreting, a, hormone, or, chemical, messenger, called, the, autocrine, agent, that, binds, to, autocrine, receptors, on, that, same, cell, leading, to, changes, in, the, cell, itself, this, can, be, contrasted, with, paracrine, signaling, intracrine, signaling, or, classical, endocrine, signaling, in, intracrine, signaling, the, signaling, chemicals, are, produced, inside, the, cell, and, bind, to, cytosolic, or, nuclear, receptors, without, being, secreted, from, the, cell, in, intracrine, signaling, signals, are, relayed, without, being, secreted, from, the, cell, the, intracrine, signals, not, being, secreted, outside, of, the, cell, is, what, sets, apart, intracrine, signaling, from, the, other, cell, signaling, mechanisms, such, as, autocrine, signaling, in, both, autocrine, and, intracrine, signaling, the, signal, has, an, effect, on, the, cell, that, produced, it, juxtacrine, signaling, is, a, type, of, cell, cell, or, cell, extracellular, matrix, signaling, in, multicellular, organisms, that, requires, close, contact, there, are, three, types, additionally, in, unicellular, organisms, such, as, bacteria, juxtacrine, signaling, means, interactions, by, membrane, contact, juxtacrine, signaling, has, been, observed, for, some, growth, factors, cytokine, and, chemokine, cellular, signals, playing, an, important, role, in, the, immune, response, juxtacrine, signalling, via, direct, membrane, contacts, is, also, present, between, neuronal, cell, bodies, and, motile, processes, of, microglia, both, during, development, and, in, the, adult, brain, in, paracrine, signaling, a, cell, produces, a, signal, to, induce, changes, in, nearby, cells, altering, the, behaviour, of, those, cells, signaling, molecules, known, as, paracrine, factors, diffuse, over, a, relatively, short, distance, local, action, as, opposed, to, cell, signaling, by, endocrine, factors, hormones, which, travel, considerably, longer, distances, via, the, circulatory, system, juxtacrine, interactions, and, autocrine, signaling, cells, that, produce, paracrine, factors, secrete, them, into, the, immediate, extracellular, environment, factors, then, travel, to, nearby, cells, in, which, the, gradient, of, factor, received, determines, the, outcome, however, the, exact, distance, that, paracrine, factors, can, travel, is, not, certain, paracrine, signals, such, as, retinoic, acid, target, only, cells, in, the, vicinity, of, the, emitting, cell, neurotransmitters, represent, another, example, of, a, paracrine, signal, some, signaling, molecules, can, function, as, both, a, hormone, and, a, neurotransmitter, for, example, epinephrine, and, norepinephrine, can, function, as, hormones, when, released, from, the, adrenal, gland, and, are, transported, to, the, heart, by, way, of, the, blood, stream, norepinephrine, can, also, be, produced, by, neurons, to, function, as, a, neurotransmitter, within, the, brain, estrogen, can, be, released, by, the, ovary, and, function, as, a, hormone, or, act, locally, via, paracrine, or, autocrine, signaling, although, paracrine, signaling, elicits, a, diverse, array, of, responses, in, the, induced, cells, most, paracrine, factors, utilize, a, relatively, streamlined, set, of, receptors, and, pathways, in, fact, different, organs, in, the, body, even, between, different, species, are, known, to, utilize, a, similar, sets, of, paracrine, factors, in, differential, development, the, highly, conserved, receptors, and, pathways, can, be, organized, into, four, major, families, based, on, similar, structures, fibroblast, growth, factor, fgf, family, hedgehog, family, wnt, family, and, tgf, superfamily, binding, of, a, paracrine, factor, to, its, respective, receptor, initiates, signal, transduction, cascades, eliciting, different, responses, endocrine, signals, are, called, hormones, hormones, are, produced, by, endocrine, cells, and, they, travel, through, the, blood, to, reach, all, parts, of, the, body, specificity, of, signaling, can, be, controlled, if, only, some, cells, can, respond, to, a, particular, hormone, endocrine, signaling, involves, the, release, of, hormones, by, internal, glands, of, an, organism, directly, into, the, circulatory, system, regulating, distant, target, organs, in, vertebrates, the, hypothalamus, is, the, neural, control, center, for, all, endocrine, systems, in, humans, the, major, endocrine, glands, are, the, thyroid, gland, and, the, adrenal, glands, the, study, of, the, endocrine, system, and, its, disorders, is, known, as, endocrinology, cells, receive, information, from, their, neighbors, through, a, class, of, proteins, known, as, receptors, receptors, may, bind, with, some, molecules, ligands, or, may, interact, with, physical, agents, like, light, mechanical, temperature, pressure, etc, reception, occurs, when, the, target, cell, any, cell, with, a, receptor, protein, specific, to, the, signal, molecule, detects, a, signal, usually, in, the, form, of, a, small, water, soluble, molecule, via, binding, to, a, receptor, protein, on, the, cell, surface, or, once, inside, the, cell, the, signaling, molecule, can, bind, to, intracellular, receptors, other, elements, or, stimulate, enzyme, activity, e, g, gasses, as, in, intracrine, signaling, signaling, molecules, interact, with, a, target, cell, as, a, ligand, to, cell, surface, receptors, and, or, by, entering, into, the, cell, through, its, membrane, or, endocytosis, for, intracrine, signaling, this, generally, results, in, the, activation, of, second, messengers, leading, to, various, physiological, effects, in, many, mammals, early, embryo, cells, exchange, signals, with, cells, of, the, uterus, in, the, human, gastrointestinal, tract, bacteria, exchange, signals, with, each, other, and, with, human, epithelial, and, immune, system, cells, for, the, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, during, mating, some, cells, send, a, peptide, signal, mating, factor, pheromones, into, their, environment, the, mating, factor, peptide, may, bind, to, a, cell, surface, receptor, on, other, yeast, cells, and, induce, them, to, prepare, for, mating, cell, surface, receptors, play, an, essential, role, in, the, biological, systems, of, single, and, multi, cellular, organisms, and, malfunction, or, damage, to, these, proteins, is, associated, with, cancer, heart, disease, and, asthma, these, trans, membrane, receptors, are, able, to, transmit, information, from, outside, the, cell, to, the, inside, because, they, change, conformation, when, a, specific, ligand, binds, to, it, there, are, three, major, types, ion, channel, linked, receptors, g, protein, coupled, receptors, and, enzyme, linked, receptors, ion, channel, linked, receptors, are, a, group, of, transmembrane, ion, channel, proteins, which, open, to, allow, ions, such, as, na, k, ca, 2, and, or, cl, to, pass, through, the, membrane, in, response, to, the, binding, of, a, chemical, messenger, i, e, a, ligand, such, as, a, neurotransmitter, when, a, presynaptic, neuron, is, excited, it, releases, a, neurotransmitter, from, vesicles, into, the, synaptic, cleft, the, neurotransmitter, then, binds, to, receptors, located, on, the, postsynaptic, neuron, if, these, receptors, are, ligand, gated, ion, channels, a, resulting, conformational, change, opens, the, ion, channels, which, leads, to, a, flow, of, ions, across, the, cell, membrane, this, in, turn, results, in, either, a, depolarization, for, an, excitatory, receptor, response, or, a, hyperpolarization, for, an, inhibitory, response, these, receptor, proteins, are, typically, composed, of, at, least, two, different, domains, a, transmembrane, domain, which, includes, the, ion, pore, and, an, extracellular, domain, which, includes, the, ligand, binding, location, an, allosteric, binding, site, this, modularity, has, enabled, a, divide, and, conquer, approach, to, finding, the, structure, of, the, proteins, crystallising, each, domain, separately, the, function, of, such, receptors, located, at, synapses, is, to, convert, the, chemical, signal, of, presynaptically, released, neurotransmitter, directly, and, very, quickly, into, a, postsynaptic, electrical, signal, many, lics, are, additionally, modulated, by, allosteric, ligands, by, channel, blockers, ions, or, the, membrane, potential, lics, are, classified, into, three, superfamilies, which, lack, evolutionary, relationship, cys, loop, receptors, ionotropic, glutamate, receptors, and, atp, gated, channels, g, protein, coupled, receptors, are, a, large, group, of, evolutionarily, related, proteins, that, are, cell, surface, receptors, that, detect, molecules, outside, the, cell, and, activate, cellular, responses, coupling, with, g, proteins, they, are, called, seven, transmembrane, receptors, because, they, pass, through, the, cell, membrane, seven, times, the, g, protein, acts, as, a, middle, man, transferring, the, signal, from, its, activated, receptor, to, its, target, and, therefore, indirectly, regulates, that, target, protein, ligands, can, bind, either, to, extracellular, n, terminus, and, loops, e, g, glutamate, receptors, or, to, the, binding, site, within, transmembrane, helices, rhodopsin, like, family, they, are, all, activated, by, agonists, although, a, spontaneous, auto, activation, of, an, empty, receptor, can, also, be, observed, g, protein, coupled, receptors, are, found, only, in, eukaryotes, including, yeast, choanoflagellates, and, animals, the, ligands, that, bind, and, activate, these, receptors, include, light, sensitive, compounds, odors, pheromones, hormones, and, neurotransmitters, and, vary, in, size, from, small, molecules, to, peptides, to, large, proteins, g, protein, coupled, receptors, are, involved, in, many, diseases, there, are, two, principal, signal, transduction, pathways, involving, the, g, protein, coupled, receptors, camp, signal, pathway, and, phosphatidylinositol, signal, pathway, when, a, ligand, binds, to, the, gpcr, it, causes, a, conformational, change, in, the, gpcr, which, allows, it, to, act, as, a, guanine, nucleotide, exchange, factor, gef, the, gpcr, can, then, activate, an, associated, g, protein, by, exchanging, the, gdp, bound, to, the, g, protein, for, a, gtp, the, g, protein, s, subunit, together, with, the, bound, gtp, can, then, dissociate, from, the, and, subunits, to, further, affect, intracellular, signaling, proteins, or, target, functional, proteins, directly, depending, on, the, subunit, type, g, s, g, i, o, g, q, 11, g, 12, 13, 1160, g, protein, coupled, receptors, are, an, important, drug, target, and, approximately, 34, of, all, food, and, drug, administration, fda, approved, drugs, target, 108, members, of, this, family, the, global, sales, volume, for, these, drugs, is, estimated, to, be, 180, billion, us, dollars, as, of, 2018, it, is, estimated, that, gpcrs, are, targets, for, about, 50, of, drugs, currently, on, the, market, mainly, due, to, their, involvement, in, signaling, pathways, related, to, many, diseases, i, e, mental, metabolic, including, endocrinological, disorders, immunological, including, viral, infections, cardiovascular, inflammatory, senses, disorders, and, cancer, the, long, ago, discovered, association, between, gpcrs, and, many, endogenous, and, exogenous, substances, resulting, in, e, g, analgesia, is, another, dynamically, developing, field, of, pharmaceutical, research, enzyme, linked, receptors, or, catalytic, receptors, are, transmembrane, receptors, that, upon, activation, by, an, extracellular, ligand, causes, enzymatic, activity, on, the, intracellular, side, hence, a, catalytic, receptor, is, an, integral, membrane, protein, possessing, both, enzymatic, catalytic, and, receptor, functions, they, have, two, important, domains, an, extra, cellular, ligand, binding, domain, and, an, intracellular, domain, which, has, a, catalytic, function, and, a, single, transmembrane, helix, the, signaling, molecule, binds, to, the, receptor, on, the, outside, of, the, cell, and, causes, a, conformational, change, on, the, catalytic, function, located, on, the, receptor, inside, the, cell, examples, of, the, enzymatic, activity, include, intracellular, receptors, exist, freely, in, the, cytoplasm, nucleus, or, can, be, bound, to, organelles, or, membranes, for, example, the, presence, of, nuclear, and, mitochondrial, receptors, is, well, documented, the, binding, of, a, ligand, to, the, intracellular, receptor, typically, induces, a, response, in, the, cell, intracellular, receptors, often, have, a, level, of, specificity, this, allows, the, receptors, to, initiate, certain, responses, when, bound, to, a, corresponding, ligand, intracellular, receptors, typically, act, on, lipid, soluble, molecules, the, receptors, bind, to, a, group, of, dna, binding, proteins, upon, binding, the, receptor, ligand, complex, translocates, to, the, nucleus, where, they, can, alter, patterns, of, gene, expression, steroid, hormone, receptors, are, found, in, the, nucleus, cytosol, and, also, on, the, plasma, membrane, of, target, cells, they, are, generally, intracellular, receptors, typically, cytoplasmic, or, nuclear, and, initiate, signal, transduction, for, steroid, hormones, which, lead, to, changes, in, gene, expression, over, a, time, period, of, hours, to, days, the, best, studied, steroid, hormone, receptors, are, members, of, the, nuclear, receptor, subfamily, 3, nr3, that, include, receptors, for, estrogen, group, nr3a, and, 3, ketosteroids, group, nr3c, in, addition, to, nuclear, receptors, several, g, protein, coupled, receptors, and, ion, channels, act, as, cell, surface, receptors, for, certain, steroid, hormones, receptor, mediated, endocytosis, is, common, way, of, turning, receptors, off, endocytic, down, regulation, is, regarded, as, a, means, for, reducing, receptor, signaling, the, process, involves, the, binding, of, a, ligand, to, the, receptor, which, then, triggers, the, formation, of, coated, pits, the, coated, pits, transform, to, coated, vesicles, and, are, transported, to, the, endosome, receptor, phosphorylation, is, another, type, of, receptor, down, regulation, biochemical, changes, can, reduce, receptor, affinity, for, a, ligand, reducing, the, sensitivity, of, the, receptor, is, a, result, of, receptors, being, occupied, for, a, long, time, this, results, in, a, receptor, adaptation, in, which, the, receptor, no, longer, responds, to, the, signaling, molecule, many, receptors, have, the, ability, to, change, in, response, to, ligand, concentration, when, binding, to, the, signaling, molecule, the, receptor, protein, changes, in, some, way, and, starts, the, process, of, transduction, which, can, occur, in, a, single, step, or, as, a, series, of, changes, in, a, sequence, of, different, molecules, called, a, signal, transduction, pathway, the, molecules, that, compose, these, pathways, are, known, as, relay, molecules, the, multistep, process, of, the, transduction, stage, is, often, composed, of, the, activation, of, proteins, by, addition, or, removal, of, phosphate, groups, or, even, the, release, of, other, small, molecules, or, ions, that, can, act, as, messengers, the, amplifying, of, a, signal, is, one, of, the, benefits, to, this, multiple, step, sequence, other, benefits, include, more, opportunities, for, regulation, than, simpler, systems, do, and, the, fine, tuning, of, the, response, in, both, unicellular, and, multicellular, organism, in, some, cases, receptor, activation, caused, by, ligand, binding, to, a, receptor, is, directly, coupled, to, the, cell, s, response, to, the, ligand, for, example, the, neurotransmitter, gaba, can, activate, a, cell, surface, receptor, that, is, part, of, an, ion, channel, gaba, binding, to, a, gaba, a, receptor, on, a, neuron, opens, a, chloride, selective, ion, channel, that, is, part, of, the, receptor, gaba, a, receptor, activation, allows, negatively, charged, chloride, ions, to, move, into, the, neuron, which, inhibits, the, ability, of, the, neuron, to, produce, action, potentials, however, for, many, cell, surface, receptors, ligand, receptor, interactions, are, not, directly, linked, to, the, cell, s, response, the, activated, receptor, must, first, interact, with, other, proteins, inside, the, cell, before, the, ultimate, physiological, effect, of, the, ligand, on, the, cell, s, behavior, is, produced, often, the, behavior, of, a, chain, of, several, interacting, cell, proteins, is, altered, following, receptor, activation, the, entire, set, of, cell, changes, induced, by, receptor, activation, is, called, a, signal, transduction, mechanism, or, pathway, a, more, complex, signal, transduction, pathway, is, the, mapk, erk, pathway, which, involves, changes, of, protein, protein, interactions, inside, the, cell, induced, by, an, external, signal, many, growth, factors, bind, to, receptors, at, the, cell, surface, and, stimulate, cells, to, progress, through, the, cell, cycle, and, divide, several, of, these, receptors, are, kinases, that, start, to, phosphorylate, themselves, and, other, proteins, when, binding, to, a, ligand, this, phosphorylation, can, generate, a, binding, site, for, a, different, protein, and, thus, induce, protein, protein, interaction, in, this, case, the, ligand, called, epidermal, growth, factor, or, egf, binds, to, the, receptor, called, egfr, this, activates, the, receptor, to, phosphorylate, itself, the, phosphorylated, receptor, binds, to, an, adaptor, protein, grb2, which, couples, the, signal, to, further, downstream, signaling, processes, for, example, one, of, the, signal, transduction, pathways, that, are, activated, is, called, the, mitogen, activated, protein, kinase, mapk, pathway, the, signal, transduction, component, labeled, as, mapk, in, the, pathway, was, originally, called, erk, so, the, pathway, is, called, the, mapk, erk, pathway, the, mapk, protein, is, an, enzyme, a, protein, kinase, that, can, attach, phosphate, to, target, proteins, such, as, the, transcription, factor, myc, and, thus, alter, gene, transcription, and, ultimately, cell, cycle, progression, many, cellular, proteins, are, activated, downstream, of, the, growth, factor, receptors, such, as, egfr, that, initiate, this, signal, transduction, pathway, some, signaling, transduction, pathways, respond, differently, depending, on, the, amount, of, signaling, received, by, the, cell, for, instance, the, hedgehog, protein, activates, different, genes, depending, on, the, amount, of, hedgehog, protein, present, complex, multi, component, signal, transduction, pathways, provide, opportunities, for, feedback, signal, amplification, and, interactions, inside, one, cell, between, multiple, signals, and, signaling, pathways, a, specific, cellular, response, is, the, result, of, the, transduced, signal, in, the, final, stage, of, cell, signaling, this, response, can, essentially, be, any, cellular, activity, that, is, present, in, a, body, it, can, spur, the, rearrangement, of, the, cytoskeleton, or, even, as, catalysis, by, an, enzyme, these, three, steps, of, cell, signaling, all, ensure, that, the, right, cells, are, behaving, as, told, at, the, right, time, and, in, synchronization, with, other, cells, and, their, own, functions, within, the, organism, at, the, end, the, end, of, a, signal, pathway, leads, to, the, regulation, of, a, cellular, activity, this, response, can, take, place, in, the, nucleus, or, in, the, cytoplasm, of, the, cell, a, majority, of, signaling, pathways, control, protein, synthesis, by, turning, certain, genes, on, and, off, in, the, nucleus, in, unicellular, organisms, such, as, bacteria, signaling, can, be, used, to, activate, peers, from, a, dormant, state, enhance, virulence, defend, against, bacteriophages, etc, in, quorum, sensing, which, is, also, found, in, social, insects, the, multiplicity, of, individual, signals, has, the, potentiality, to, create, a, positive, feedback, loop, generating, coordinated, response, in, this, context, the, signaling, molecules, are, called, autoinducers, this, signaling, mechanism, may, have, been, involved, in, evolution, from, unicellular, to, multicellular, organisms, bacteria, also, use, contact, dependent, signaling, notably, to, limit, their, growth, signaling, molecules, used, by, multicellular, organisms, are, often, called, pheromones, they, can, have, such, purposes, as, alerting, against, danger, indicating, food, supply, or, assisting, in, reproduction, notch, is, a, cell, surface, protein, that, functions, as, a, receptor, animals, have, a, small, set, of, genes, that, code, for, signaling, proteins, that, interact, specifically, with, notch, receptors, and, stimulate, a, response, in, cells, that, express, notch, on, their, surface, molecules, that, activate, or, in, some, cases, inhibit, receptors, can, be, classified, as, hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, and, growth, factors, in, general, called, receptor, ligands, ligand, receptor, interactions, such, as, that, of, the, notch, receptor, interaction, are, known, to, be, the, main, interactions, responsible, for, cell, signaling, mechanisms, and, communication, notch, acts, as, a, receptor, for, ligands, that, are, expressed, on, adjacent, cells, while, some, receptors, are, cell, surface, proteins, others, are, found, inside, cells, for, example, estrogen, is, a, hydrophobic, molecule, that, can, pass, through, the, lipid, bilayer, of, the, membranes, as, part, of, the, endocrine, system, intracellular, estrogen, receptors, from, a, variety, of, cell, types, can, be, activated, by, estrogen, produced, in, the, ovaries, in, the, case, of, notch, mediated, signaling, the, signal, transduction, mechanism, can, be, relatively, simple, as, shown, in, figure, 2, the, activation, of, notch, can, cause, the, notch, protein, to, be, altered, by, a, protease, part, of, the, notch, protein, is, released, from, the, cell, surface, membrane, and, takes, part, in, gene, regulation, cell, signaling, research, involves, studying, the, spatial, and, temporal, dynamics, of, both, receptors, and, the, components, of, signaling, pathways, that, are, activated, by, receptors, in, various, cell, types, emerging, methods, for, single, cell, mass, spectrometry, analysis, promise, to, enable, studying, signal, transduction, with, single, cell, resolution, in, notch, signaling, direct, contact, between, cells, allows, for, precise, control, of, cell, differentiation, during, embryonic, development, in, the, worm, caenorhabditis, elegans, two, cells, of, the, developing, gonad, each, have, an, equal, chance, of, terminally, differentiating, or, becoming, a, uterine, precursor, cell, that, continues, to, divide, the, choice, of, which, cell, continues, to, divide, is, controlled, by, competition, of, cell, surface, signals, one, cell, will, happen, to, produce, more, of, a, cell, surface, protein, that, activates, the, notch, receptor, on, the, adjacent, cell, this, activates, a, feedback, loop, or, system, that, reduces, notch, expression, in, the, cell, that, will, differentiate, and, that, increases, notch, on, the, surface, of, the, cell, that, continues, as, a, stem, cell
