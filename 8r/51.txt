the, immune, system, is, a, network, of, biological, systems, that, protects, an, organism, from, diseases, it, detects, and, responds, to, a, wide, variety, of, pathogens, from, viruses, to, parasitic, worms, as, well, as, cancer, cells, and, objects, such, as, wood, splinters, distinguishing, them, from, the, organism, s, own, healthy, tissue, many, species, have, two, major, subsystems, of, the, immune, system, the, innate, immune, system, provides, a, preconfigured, response, to, broad, groups, of, situations, and, stimuli, the, adaptive, immune, system, provides, a, tailored, response, to, each, stimulus, by, learning, to, recognize, molecules, it, has, previously, encountered, both, use, molecules, and, cells, to, perform, their, functions, nearly, all, organisms, have, some, kind, of, immune, system, bacteria, have, a, rudimentary, immune, system, in, the, form, of, enzymes, that, protect, against, viral, infections, other, basic, immune, mechanisms, evolved, in, ancient, plants, and, animals, and, remain, in, their, modern, descendants, these, mechanisms, include, phagocytosis, antimicrobial, peptides, called, defensins, and, the, complement, system, jawed, vertebrates, including, humans, have, even, more, sophisticated, defense, mechanisms, including, the, ability, to, adapt, to, recognize, pathogens, more, efficiently, adaptive, or, acquired, immunity, creates, an, immunological, memory, leading, to, an, enhanced, response, to, subsequent, encounters, with, that, same, pathogen, this, process, of, acquired, immunity, is, the, basis, of, vaccination, dysfunction, of, the, immune, system, can, cause, autoimmune, diseases, inflammatory, diseases, and, cancer, immunodeficiency, occurs, when, the, immune, system, is, less, active, than, normal, resulting, in, recurring, and, life, threatening, infections, in, humans, immunodeficiency, can, be, the, result, of, a, genetic, disease, such, as, severe, combined, immunodeficiency, acquired, conditions, such, as, hiv, aids, or, the, use, of, immunosuppressive, medication, autoimmunity, results, from, a, hyperactive, immune, system, attacking, normal, tissues, as, if, they, were, foreign, organisms, common, autoimmune, diseases, include, hashimoto, s, thyroiditis, rheumatoid, arthritis, diabetes, mellitus, type, 1, and, systemic, lupus, erythematosus, immunology, covers, the, study, of, all, aspects, of, the, immune, system, the, immune, system, protects, its, host, from, infection, with, layered, defenses, of, increasing, specificity, physical, barriers, prevent, pathogens, such, as, bacteria, and, viruses, from, entering, the, organism, if, a, pathogen, breaches, these, barriers, the, innate, immune, system, provides, an, immediate, but, non, specific, response, innate, immune, systems, are, found, in, all, animals, if, pathogens, successfully, evade, the, innate, response, vertebrates, possess, a, second, layer, of, protection, the, adaptive, immune, system, which, is, activated, by, the, innate, response, here, the, immune, system, adapts, its, response, during, an, infection, to, improve, its, recognition, of, the, pathogen, this, improved, response, is, then, retained, after, the, pathogen, has, been, eliminated, in, the, form, of, an, immunological, memory, and, allows, the, adaptive, immune, system, to, mount, faster, and, stronger, attacks, each, time, this, pathogen, is, encountered, both, innate, and, adaptive, immunity, depend, on, the, ability, of, the, immune, system, to, distinguish, between, self, and, non, self, molecules, in, immunology, self, molecules, are, components, of, an, organism, s, body, that, can, be, distinguished, from, foreign, substances, by, the, immune, system, conversely, non, self, molecules, are, those, recognized, as, foreign, molecules, one, class, of, non, self, molecules, are, called, antigens, originally, named, for, being, anti, body, gen, erators, and, are, defined, as, substances, that, bind, to, specific, immune, receptors, and, elicit, an, immune, response, several, barriers, protect, organisms, from, infection, including, mechanical, chemical, and, biological, barriers, the, waxy, cuticle, of, most, leaves, the, exoskeleton, of, insects, the, shells, and, membranes, of, externally, deposited, eggs, and, skin, are, examples, of, mechanical, barriers, that, are, the, first, line, of, defense, against, infection, organisms, cannot, be, completely, sealed, from, their, environments, so, systems, act, to, protect, body, openings, such, as, the, lungs, intestines, and, the, genitourinary, tract, in, the, lungs, coughing, and, sneezing, mechanically, eject, pathogens, and, other, irritants, from, the, respiratory, tract, the, flushing, action, of, tears, and, urine, also, mechanically, expels, pathogens, while, mucus, secreted, by, the, respiratory, and, gastrointestinal, tract, serves, to, trap, and, entangle, microorganisms, chemical, barriers, also, protect, against, infection, the, skin, and, respiratory, tract, secrete, antimicrobial, peptides, such, as, the, defensins, enzymes, such, as, lysozyme, and, phospholipase, a2, in, saliva, tears, and, breast, milk, are, also, antibacterials, vaginal, secretions, serve, as, a, chemical, barrier, following, menarche, when, they, become, slightly, acidic, while, semen, contains, defensins, and, zinc, to, kill, pathogens, in, the, stomach, gastric, acid, serves, as, a, chemical, defense, against, ingested, pathogens, within, the, genitourinary, and, gastrointestinal, tracts, commensal, flora, serve, as, biological, barriers, by, competing, with, pathogenic, bacteria, for, food, and, space, and, in, some, cases, changing, the, conditions, in, their, environment, such, as, ph, or, available, iron, as, a, result, the, probability, that, pathogens, will, reach, sufficient, numbers, to, cause, illness, is, reduced, microorganisms, or, toxins, that, successfully, enter, an, organism, encounter, the, cells, and, mechanisms, of, the, innate, immune, system, the, innate, response, is, usually, triggered, when, microbes, are, identified, by, pattern, recognition, receptors, which, recognize, components, that, are, conserved, among, broad, groups, of, microorganisms, or, when, damaged, injured, or, stressed, cells, send, out, alarm, signals, many, of, which, are, recognized, by, the, same, receptors, as, those, that, recognize, pathogens, innate, immune, defenses, are, non, specific, meaning, these, systems, respond, to, pathogens, in, a, generic, way, this, system, does, not, confer, long, lasting, immunity, against, a, pathogen, the, innate, immune, system, is, the, dominant, system, of, host, defense, in, most, organisms, and, the, only, one, in, plants, cells, in, the, innate, immune, system, use, pattern, recognition, receptors, to, recognize, molecular, structures, that, are, produced, by, pathogens, they, are, proteins, expressed, mainly, by, cells, of, the, innate, immune, system, such, as, dendritic, cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and, epithelial, cells, to, identify, two, classes, of, molecules, pathogen, associated, molecular, patterns, pamps, which, are, associated, with, microbial, pathogens, and, damage, associated, molecular, patterns, damps, which, are, associated, with, components, of, host, s, cells, that, are, released, during, cell, damage, or, cell, death, recognition, of, extracellular, or, endosomal, pamps, is, mediated, by, transmembrane, proteins, known, as, toll, like, receptors, tlrs, tlrs, share, a, typical, structural, motif, the, leucine, rich, repeats, lrrs, which, give, them, a, curved, shape, toll, like, receptors, were, first, discovered, in, drosophila, and, trigger, the, synthesis, and, secretion, of, cytokines, and, activation, of, other, host, defense, programs, that, are, necessary, for, both, innate, or, adaptive, immune, responses, ten, toll, like, receptors, have, been, described, in, humans, cells, in, the, innate, immune, system, have, pattern, recognition, receptors, which, detect, infection, or, cell, damage, inside, three, major, classes, of, these, cytosolic, receptors, are, nod, like, receptors, rig, retinoic, acid, inducible, gene, like, receptors, and, cytosolic, dna, sensors, some, leukocytes, white, blood, cells, act, like, independent, single, celled, organisms, and, are, the, second, arm, of, the, innate, immune, system, the, innate, leukocytes, include, the, professional, phagocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and, dendritic, cells, these, cells, identify, and, eliminate, pathogens, either, by, attacking, larger, pathogens, through, contact, or, by, engulfing, and, then, killing, microorganisms, the, other, cells, involved, in, the, innate, response, include, innate, lymphoid, cells, mast, cells, eosinophils, basophils, and, natural, killer, cells, phagocytosis, is, an, important, feature, of, cellular, innate, immunity, performed, by, cells, called, phagocytes, that, engulf, pathogens, or, particles, phagocytes, generally, patrol, the, body, searching, for, pathogens, but, can, be, called, to, specific, locations, by, cytokines, once, a, pathogen, has, been, engulfed, by, a, phagocyte, it, becomes, trapped, in, an, intracellular, vesicle, called, a, phagosome, which, subsequently, fuses, with, another, vesicle, called, a, lysosome, to, form, a, phagolysosome, the, pathogen, is, killed, by, the, activity, of, digestive, enzymes, or, following, a, respiratory, burst, that, releases, free, radicals, into, the, phagolysosome, phagocytosis, evolved, as, a, means, of, acquiring, nutrients, but, this, role, was, extended, in, phagocytes, to, include, engulfment, of, pathogens, as, a, defense, mechanism, phagocytosis, probably, represents, the, oldest, form, of, host, defense, as, phagocytes, have, been, identified, in, both, vertebrate, and, invertebrate, animals, neutrophils, and, macrophages, are, phagocytes, that, travel, throughout, the, body, in, pursuit, of, invading, pathogens, neutrophils, are, normally, found, in, the, bloodstream, and, are, the, most, abundant, type, of, phagocyte, representing, 50, to, 60, of, total, circulating, leukocytes, during, the, acute, phase, of, inflammation, neutrophils, migrate, toward, the, site, of, inflammation, in, a, process, called, chemotaxis, and, are, usually, the, first, cells, to, arrive, at, the, scene, of, infection, macrophages, are, versatile, cells, that, reside, within, tissues, and, produce, an, array, of, chemicals, including, enzymes, complement, proteins, and, cytokines, they, can, also, act, as, scavengers, that, rid, the, body, of, worn, out, cells, and, other, debris, and, as, antigen, presenting, cells, apcs, that, activate, the, adaptive, immune, system, dendritic, cells, are, phagocytes, in, tissues, that, are, in, contact, with, the, external, environment, therefore, they, are, located, mainly, in, the, skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and, intestines, they, are, named, for, their, resemblance, to, neuronal, dendrites, as, both, have, many, spine, like, projections, dendritic, cells, serve, as, a, link, between, the, bodily, tissues, and, the, innate, and, adaptive, immune, systems, as, they, present, antigens, to, t, cells, one, of, the, key, cell, types, of, the, adaptive, immune, system, granulocytes, are, leukocytes, that, have, granules, in, their, cytoplasm, in, this, category, are, neutrophils, mast, cells, basophils, and, eosinophils, mast, cells, reside, in, connective, tissues, and, mucous, membranes, and, regulate, the, inflammatory, response, they, are, most, often, associated, with, allergy, and, anaphylaxis, basophils, and, eosinophils, are, related, to, neutrophils, they, secrete, chemical, mediators, that, are, involved, in, defending, against, parasites, and, play, a, role, in, allergic, reactions, such, as, asthma, innate, lymphoid, cells, ilcs, are, a, group, of, innate, immune, cells, that, are, derived, from, common, lymphoid, progenitor, and, belong, to, the, lymphoid, lineage, these, cells, are, defined, by, the, absence, of, antigen, specific, b, or, t, cell, receptor, tcr, because, of, the, lack, of, recombination, activating, gene, ilcs, do, not, express, myeloid, or, dendritic, cell, markers, natural, killer, cells, nk, cells, are, lymphocytes, and, a, component, of, the, innate, immune, system, that, does, not, directly, attack, invading, microbes, rather, nk, cells, destroy, compromised, host, cells, such, as, tumor, cells, or, virus, infected, cells, recognizing, such, cells, by, a, condition, known, as, missing, self, this, term, describes, cells, with, low, levels, of, a, cell, surface, marker, called, mhc, i, major, histocompatibility, complex, a, situation, that, can, arise, in, viral, infections, of, host, cells, normal, body, cells, are, not, recognized, and, attacked, by, nk, cells, because, they, express, intact, self, mhc, antigens, those, mhc, antigens, are, recognized, by, killer, cell, immunoglobulin, receptors, which, essentially, put, the, brakes, on, nk, cells, inflammation, is, one, of, the, first, responses, of, the, immune, system, to, infection, the, symptoms, of, inflammation, are, redness, swelling, heat, and, pain, which, are, caused, by, increased, blood, flow, into, tissue, inflammation, is, produced, by, eicosanoids, and, cytokines, which, are, released, by, injured, or, infected, cells, eicosanoids, include, prostaglandins, that, produce, fever, and, the, dilation, of, blood, vessels, associated, with, inflammation, and, leukotrienes, that, attract, certain, white, blood, cells, leukocytes, common, cytokines, include, interleukins, that, are, responsible, for, communication, between, white, blood, cells, chemokines, that, promote, chemotaxis, and, interferons, that, have, antiviral, effects, such, as, shutting, down, protein, synthesis, in, the, host, cell, growth, factors, and, cytotoxic, factors, may, also, be, released, these, cytokines, and, other, chemicals, recruit, immune, cells, to, the, site, of, infection, and, promote, the, healing, of, any, damaged, tissue, following, the, removal, of, pathogens, the, pattern, recognition, receptors, called, inflammasomes, are, multiprotein, complexes, consisting, of, an, nlr, the, adaptor, protein, asc, and, the, effector, molecule, pro, caspase, 1, that, form, in, response, to, cytosolic, pamps, and, damps, whose, function, is, to, generate, active, forms, of, the, inflammatory, cytokines, il, 1, and, il, 18, the, complement, system, is, a, biochemical, cascade, that, attacks, the, surfaces, of, foreign, cells, it, contains, over, 20, different, proteins, and, is, named, for, its, ability, to, complement, the, killing, of, pathogens, by, antibodies, complement, is, the, major, humoral, component, of, the, innate, immune, response, many, species, have, complement, systems, including, non, mammals, like, plants, fish, and, some, invertebrates, in, humans, this, response, is, activated, by, complement, binding, to, antibodies, that, have, attached, to, these, microbes, or, the, binding, of, complement, proteins, to, carbohydrates, on, the, surfaces, of, microbes, this, recognition, signal, triggers, a, rapid, killing, response, the, speed, of, the, response, is, a, result, of, signal, amplification, that, occurs, after, sequential, proteolytic, activation, of, complement, molecules, which, are, also, proteases, after, complement, proteins, initially, bind, to, the, microbe, they, activate, their, protease, activity, which, in, turn, activates, other, complement, proteases, and, so, on, this, produces, a, catalytic, cascade, that, amplifies, the, initial, signal, by, controlled, positive, feedback, the, cascade, results, in, the, production, of, peptides, that, attract, immune, cells, increase, vascular, permeability, and, opsonize, coat, the, surface, of, a, pathogen, marking, it, for, destruction, this, deposition, of, complement, can, also, kill, cells, directly, by, disrupting, their, plasma, membrane, via, the, formation, of, a, membrane, attack, complex, the, adaptive, immune, system, evolved, in, early, vertebrates, and, allows, for, a, stronger, immune, response, as, well, as, immunological, memory, where, each, pathogen, is, remembered, by, a, signature, antigen, the, adaptive, immune, response, is, antigen, specific, and, requires, the, recognition, of, specific, non, self, antigens, during, a, process, called, antigen, presentation, antigen, specificity, allows, for, the, generation, of, responses, that, are, tailored, to, specific, pathogens, or, pathogen, infected, cells, the, ability, to, mount, these, tailored, responses, is, maintained, in, the, body, by, memory, cells, should, a, pathogen, infect, the, body, more, than, once, these, specific, memory, cells, are, used, to, quickly, eliminate, it, the, cells, of, the, adaptive, immune, system, are, special, types, of, leukocytes, called, lymphocytes, b, cells, and, t, cells, are, the, major, types, of, lymphocytes, and, are, derived, from, hematopoietic, stem, cells, in, the, bone, marrow, b, cells, are, involved, in, the, humoral, immune, response, whereas, t, cells, are, involved, in, cell, mediated, immune, response, killer, t, cells, only, recognize, antigens, coupled, to, class, i, mhc, molecules, while, helper, t, cells, and, regulatory, t, cells, only, recognize, antigens, coupled, to, class, ii, mhc, molecules, these, two, mechanisms, of, antigen, presentation, reflect, the, different, roles, of, the, two, types, of, t, cell, a, third, minor, subtype, are, the, t, cells, that, recognize, intact, antigens, that, are, not, bound, to, mhc, receptors, the, double, positive, t, cells, are, exposed, to, a, wide, variety, of, self, antigens, in, the, thymus, in, which, iodine, is, necessary, for, its, thymus, development, and, activity, in, contrast, the, b, cell, antigen, specific, receptor, is, an, antibody, molecule, on, the, b, cell, surface, and, recognizes, native, unprocessed, antigen, without, any, need, for, antigen, processing, such, antigens, may, be, large, molecules, found, on, the, surfaces, of, pathogens, but, can, also, be, small, haptens, such, as, penicillin, attached, to, carrier, molecule, each, lineage, of, b, cell, expresses, a, different, antibody, so, the, complete, set, of, b, cell, antigen, receptors, represent, all, the, antibodies, that, the, body, can, manufacture, when, b, or, t, cells, encounter, their, related, antigens, they, multiply, and, many, clones, of, the, cells, are, produced, that, target, the, same, antigen, this, is, called, clonal, selection, both, b, cells, and, t, cells, carry, receptor, molecules, that, recognize, specific, targets, t, cells, recognize, a, non, self, target, such, as, a, pathogen, only, after, antigens, small, fragments, of, the, pathogen, have, been, processed, and, presented, in, combination, with, a, self, receptor, called, a, major, histocompatibility, complex, mhc, molecule, there, are, two, major, subtypes, of, t, cells, the, killer, t, cell, and, the, helper, t, cell, in, addition, there, are, regulatory, t, cells, which, have, a, role, in, modulating, immune, response, killer, t, cells, are, a, sub, group, of, t, cells, that, kill, cells, that, are, infected, with, viruses, and, other, pathogens, or, are, otherwise, damaged, or, dysfunctional, as, with, b, cells, each, type, of, t, cell, recognizes, a, different, antigen, killer, t, cells, are, activated, when, their, t, cell, receptor, binds, to, this, specific, antigen, in, a, complex, with, the, mhc, class, i, receptor, of, another, cell, recognition, of, this, mhc, antigen, complex, is, aided, by, a, co, receptor, on, the, t, cell, called, cd8, the, t, cell, then, travels, throughout, the, body, in, search, of, cells, where, the, mhc, i, receptors, bear, this, antigen, when, an, activated, t, cell, contacts, such, cells, it, releases, cytotoxins, such, as, perforin, which, form, pores, in, the, target, cell, s, plasma, membrane, allowing, ions, water, and, toxins, to, enter, the, entry, of, another, toxin, called, granulysin, a, protease, induces, the, target, cell, to, undergo, apoptosis, t, cell, killing, of, host, cells, is, particularly, important, in, preventing, the, replication, of, viruses, t, cell, activation, is, tightly, controlled, and, generally, requires, a, very, strong, mhc, antigen, activation, signal, or, additional, activation, signals, provided, by, helper, t, cells, see, below, helper, t, cells, regulate, both, the, innate, and, adaptive, immune, responses, and, help, determine, which, immune, responses, the, body, makes, to, a, particular, pathogen, these, cells, have, no, cytotoxic, activity, and, do, not, kill, infected, cells, or, clear, pathogens, directly, they, instead, control, the, immune, response, by, directing, other, cells, to, perform, these, tasks, helper, t, cells, express, t, cell, receptors, that, recognize, antigen, bound, to, class, ii, mhc, molecules, the, mhc, antigen, complex, is, also, recognized, by, the, helper, cell, s, cd4, co, receptor, which, recruits, molecules, inside, the, t, cell, such, as, lck, that, are, responsible, for, the, t, cell, s, activation, helper, t, cells, have, a, weaker, association, with, the, mhc, antigen, complex, than, observed, for, killer, t, cells, meaning, many, receptors, around, 200, 300, on, the, helper, t, cell, must, be, bound, by, an, mhc, antigen, to, activate, the, helper, cell, while, killer, t, cells, can, be, activated, by, engagement, of, a, single, mhc, antigen, molecule, helper, t, cell, activation, also, requires, longer, duration, of, engagement, with, an, antigen, presenting, cell, the, activation, of, a, resting, helper, t, cell, causes, it, to, release, cytokines, that, influence, the, activity, of, many, cell, types, cytokine, signals, produced, by, helper, t, cells, enhance, the, microbicidal, function, of, macrophages, and, the, activity, of, killer, t, cells, in, addition, helper, t, cell, activation, causes, an, upregulation, of, molecules, expressed, on, the, t, cell, s, surface, such, as, cd40, ligand, also, called, cd154, which, provide, extra, stimulatory, signals, typically, required, to, activate, antibody, producing, b, cells, gamma, delta, t, cells, t, cells, possess, an, alternative, t, cell, receptor, tcr, as, opposed, to, cd4, and, cd8, t, cells, and, share, the, characteristics, of, helper, t, cells, cytotoxic, t, cells, and, nk, cells, the, conditions, that, produce, responses, from, t, cells, are, not, fully, understood, like, other, unconventional, t, cell, subsets, bearing, invariant, tcrs, such, as, cd1d, restricted, natural, killer, t, cells, t, cells, straddle, the, border, between, innate, and, adaptive, immunity, on, one, hand, t, cells, are, a, component, of, adaptive, immunity, as, they, rearrange, tcr, genes, to, produce, receptor, diversity, and, can, also, develop, a, memory, phenotype, on, the, other, hand, the, various, subsets, are, also, part, of, the, innate, immune, system, as, restricted, tcr, or, nk, receptors, may, be, used, as, pattern, recognition, receptors, for, example, large, numbers, of, human, v, 9, v, 2, t, cells, respond, within, hours, to, common, molecules, produced, by, microbes, and, highly, restricted, v, 1, t, cells, in, epithelia, respond, to, stressed, epithelial, cells, a, b, cell, identifies, pathogens, when, antibodies, on, its, surface, bind, to, a, specific, foreign, antigen, this, antigen, antibody, complex, is, taken, up, by, the, b, cell, and, processed, by, proteolysis, into, peptides, the, b, cell, then, displays, these, antigenic, peptides, on, its, surface, mhc, class, ii, molecules, this, combination, of, mhc, and, antigen, attracts, a, matching, helper, t, cell, which, releases, lymphokines, and, activates, the, b, cell, as, the, activated, b, cell, then, begins, to, divide, its, offspring, plasma, cells, secrete, millions, of, copies, of, the, antibody, that, recognizes, this, antigen, these, antibodies, circulate, in, blood, plasma, and, lymph, bind, to, pathogens, expressing, the, antigen, and, mark, them, for, destruction, by, complement, activation, or, for, uptake, and, destruction, by, phagocytes, antibodies, can, also, neutralize, challenges, directly, by, binding, to, bacterial, toxins, or, by, interfering, with, the, receptors, that, viruses, and, bacteria, use, to, infect, cells, newborn, infants, have, no, prior, exposure, to, microbes, and, are, particularly, vulnerable, to, infection, several, layers, of, passive, protection, are, provided, by, the, mother, during, pregnancy, a, particular, type, of, antibody, called, igg, is, transported, from, mother, to, baby, directly, through, the, placenta, so, human, babies, have, high, levels, of, antibodies, even, at, birth, with, the, same, range, of, antigen, specificities, as, their, mother, breast, milk, or, colostrum, also, contains, antibodies, that, are, transferred, to, the, gut, of, the, infant, and, protect, against, bacterial, infections, until, the, newborn, can, synthesize, its, own, antibodies, this, is, passive, immunity, because, the, fetus, does, not, actually, make, any, memory, cells, or, antibodies, it, only, borrows, them, this, passive, immunity, is, usually, short, term, lasting, from, a, few, days, up, to, several, months, in, medicine, protective, passive, immunity, can, also, be, transferred, artificially, from, one, individual, to, another, when, b, cells, and, t, cells, are, activated, and, begin, to, replicate, some, of, their, offspring, become, long, lived, memory, cells, throughout, the, lifetime, of, an, animal, these, memory, cells, remember, each, specific, pathogen, encountered, and, can, mount, a, strong, response, if, the, pathogen, is, detected, again, t, cells, recognize, pathogens, by, small, protein, based, infection, signals, called, antigens, that, bind, to, directly, to, t, cell, surface, receptors, b, cells, use, the, protein, immunoglobulin, to, recognize, pathogens, by, their, antigens, this, is, adaptive, because, it, occurs, during, the, lifetime, of, an, individual, as, an, adaptation, to, infection, with, that, pathogen, and, prepares, the, immune, system, for, future, challenges, immunological, memory, can, be, in, the, form, of, either, passive, short, term, memory, or, active, long, term, memory, the, immune, system, is, involved, in, many, aspects, of, physiological, regulation, in, the, body, the, immune, system, interacts, intimately, with, other, systems, such, as, the, endocrine, and, the, nervous, systems, the, immune, system, also, plays, a, crucial, role, in, embryogenesis, development, of, the, embryo, as, well, as, in, tissue, repair, and, regeneration, hormones, can, act, as, immunomodulators, altering, the, sensitivity, of, the, immune, system, for, example, female, sex, hormones, are, known, immunostimulators, of, both, adaptive, and, innate, immune, responses, some, autoimmune, diseases, such, as, lupus, erythematosus, strike, women, preferentially, and, their, onset, often, coincides, with, puberty, by, contrast, male, sex, hormones, such, as, testosterone, seem, to, be, immunosuppressive, other, hormones, appear, to, regulate, the, immune, system, as, well, most, notably, prolactin, growth, hormone, and, vitamin, d, although, cellular, studies, indicate, that, vitamin, d, has, receptors, and, probable, functions, in, the, immune, system, there, is, no, clinical, evidence, to, prove, that, vitamin, d, deficiency, increases, the, risk, for, immune, diseases, or, vitamin, d, supplementation, lowers, immune, disease, risk, a, 2011, united, states, institute, of, medicine, report, stated, that, outcomes, related, to, immune, functioning, and, autoimmune, disorders, and, infections, could, not, be, linked, reliably, with, calcium, or, vitamin, d, intake, and, were, often, conflicting, 5, the, immune, system, is, affected, by, sleep, and, rest, and, sleep, deprivation, is, detrimental, to, immune, function, complex, feedback, loops, involving, cytokines, such, as, interleukin, 1, and, tumor, necrosis, factor, produced, in, response, to, infection, appear, to, also, play, a, role, in, the, regulation, of, non, rapid, eye, movement, rem, sleep, thus, the, immune, response, to, infection, may, result, in, changes, to, the, sleep, cycle, including, an, increase, in, slow, wave, sleep, relative, to, rem, sleep, in, people, with, sleep, deprivation, active, immunizations, may, have, a, diminished, effect, and, may, result, in, lower, antibody, production, and, a, lower, immune, response, than, would, be, noted, in, a, well, rested, individual, additionally, proteins, such, as, nfil3, which, have, been, shown, to, be, closely, intertwined, with, both, t, cell, differentiation, and, circadian, rhythms, can, be, affected, through, the, disturbance, of, natural, light, and, dark, cycles, through, instances, of, sleep, deprivation, these, disruptions, can, lead, to, an, increase, in, chronic, conditions, such, as, heart, disease, chronic, pain, and, asthma, in, addition, to, the, negative, consequences, of, sleep, deprivation, sleep, and, the, intertwined, circadian, system, have, been, shown, to, have, strong, regulatory, effects, on, immunological, functions, affecting, both, innate, and, adaptive, immunity, first, during, the, early, slow, wave, sleep, stage, a, sudden, drop, in, blood, levels, of, cortisol, epinephrine, and, norepinephrine, causes, increased, blood, levels, of, the, hormones, leptin, pituitary, growth, hormone, and, prolactin, these, signals, induce, a, pro, inflammatory, state, through, the, production, of, the, pro, inflammatory, cytokines, interleukin, 1, interleukin, 12, tnf, alpha, and, ifn, gamma, these, cytokines, then, stimulate, immune, functions, such, as, immune, cell, activation, proliferation, and, differentiation, during, this, time, of, a, slowly, evolving, adaptive, immune, response, there, is, a, peak, in, undifferentiated, or, less, differentiated, cells, like, na, ve, and, central, memory, t, cells, in, addition, to, these, effects, the, milieu, of, hormones, produced, at, this, time, leptin, pituitary, growth, hormone, and, prolactin, supports, the, interactions, between, apcs, and, t, cells, a, shift, of, the, t, h, 1, t, h, 2, cytokine, balance, towards, one, that, supports, t, h, 1, an, increase, in, overall, t, h, cell, proliferation, and, na, ve, t, cell, migration, to, lymph, nodes, this, is, also, thought, to, support, the, formation, of, long, lasting, immune, memory, through, the, initiation, of, th1, immune, responses, during, wake, periods, differentiated, effector, cells, such, as, cytotoxic, natural, killer, cells, and, cytotoxic, t, lymphocytes, peak, to, elicit, an, effective, response, against, any, intruding, pathogens, anti, inflammatory, molecules, such, as, cortisol, and, catecholamines, also, peak, during, awake, active, times, inflammation, would, cause, serious, cognitive, and, physical, impairments, if, it, were, to, occur, during, wake, times, and, inflammation, may, occur, during, sleep, times, due, to, the, presence, of, melatonin, inflammation, causes, a, great, deal, of, oxidative, stress, and, the, presence, of, melatonin, during, sleep, times, could, actively, counteract, free, radical, production, during, this, time, physical, exercise, has, a, positive, effect, on, the, immune, system, and, depending, on, the, frequency, and, intensity, the, pathogenic, effects, of, diseases, caused, by, bacteria, and, viruses, are, moderated, immediately, after, intense, exercise, there, is, a, transient, immunodepression, where, the, number, of, circulating, lymphocytes, decreases, and, antibody, production, declines, this, may, give, rise, to, a, window, of, opportunity, for, infection, and, reactivation, of, latent, virus, infections, but, the, evidence, is, inconclusive, during, exercise, there, is, an, increase, in, circulating, white, blood, cells, of, all, types, this, is, caused, by, the, frictional, force, of, blood, flowing, on, the, endothelial, cell, surface, and, catecholamines, affecting, adrenergic, receptors, ars, the, number, of, neutrophils, in, the, blood, increases, and, remains, raised, for, up, to, six, hours, and, immature, forms, are, present, although, the, increase, in, neutrophils, neutrophilia, is, similar, to, that, seen, during, bacterial, infections, after, exercise, the, cell, population, returns, to, normal, by, around, 24, hours, the, number, of, circulating, lymphocytes, mainly, natural, killer, cells, decreases, during, intense, exercise, but, returns, to, normal, after, 4, to, 6, hours, although, up, to, 2, of, the, cells, die, most, migrate, from, the, blood, to, the, tissues, mainly, the, intestines, and, lungs, where, pathogens, are, most, likely, to, be, encountered, some, monocytes, leave, the, blood, circulation, and, migrate, to, the, muscles, where, they, differentiate, and, become, macrophages, these, cells, differentiate, into, two, types, proliferative, macrophages, which, are, responsible, for, increasing, the, number, of, stem, cells, and, restorative, macrophages, which, are, involved, their, maturing, to, muscle, cells, the, immune, system, particularly, the, innate, component, plays, a, decisive, role, in, tissue, repair, after, an, insult, key, actors, include, macrophages, and, neutrophils, but, other, cellular, actors, including, t, cells, innate, lymphoid, cells, ilcs, and, regulatory, t, cells, tregs, are, also, important, the, plasticity, of, immune, cells, and, the, balance, between, pro, inflammatory, and, anti, inflammatory, signals, are, crucial, aspects, of, efficient, tissue, repair, immune, components, and, pathways, are, involved, in, regeneration, as, well, for, example, in, amphibians, such, as, in, axolotl, limb, regeneration, according, to, one, hypothesis, organisms, that, can, regenerate, e, g, axolotls, could, be, less, immunocompetent, than, organisms, that, cannot, regenerate, failures, of, host, defense, occur, and, fall, into, three, broad, categories, immunodeficiencies, autoimmunity, and, hypersensitivities, immunodeficiencies, occur, when, one, or, more, of, the, components, of, the, immune, system, are, inactive, the, ability, of, the, immune, system, to, respond, to, pathogens, is, diminished, in, both, the, young, and, the, elderly, with, immune, responses, beginning, to, decline, at, around, 50, years, of, age, due, to, immunosenescence, in, developed, countries, obesity, alcoholism, and, drug, use, are, common, causes, of, poor, immune, function, while, malnutrition, is, the, most, common, cause, of, immunodeficiency, in, developing, countries, diets, lacking, sufficient, protein, are, associated, with, impaired, cell, mediated, immunity, complement, activity, phagocyte, function, iga, antibody, concentrations, and, cytokine, production, additionally, the, loss, of, the, thymus, at, an, early, age, through, genetic, mutation, or, surgical, removal, results, in, severe, immunodeficiency, and, a, high, susceptibility, to, infection, immunodeficiencies, can, also, be, inherited, or, acquired, severe, combined, immunodeficiency, is, a, rare, genetic, disorder, characterized, by, the, disturbed, development, of, functional, t, cells, and, b, cells, caused, by, numerous, genetic, mutations, chronic, granulomatous, disease, where, phagocytes, have, a, reduced, ability, to, destroy, pathogens, is, an, example, of, an, inherited, or, congenital, immunodeficiency, aids, and, some, types, of, cancer, cause, acquired, immunodeficiency, overactive, immune, responses, form, the, other, end, of, immune, dysfunction, particularly, the, autoimmune, diseases, here, the, immune, system, fails, to, properly, distinguish, between, self, and, non, self, and, attacks, part, of, the, body, under, normal, circumstances, many, t, cells, and, antibodies, react, with, self, peptides, one, of, the, functions, of, specialized, cells, located, in, the, thymus, and, bone, marrow, is, to, present, young, lymphocytes, with, self, antigens, produced, throughout, the, body, and, to, eliminate, those, cells, that, recognize, self, antigens, preventing, autoimmunity, common, autoimmune, diseases, include, hashimoto, s, thyroiditis, rheumatoid, arthritis, diabetes, mellitus, type, 1, and, systemic, lupus, erythematosus, hypersensitivity, is, an, immune, response, that, damages, the, body, s, own, tissues, it, is, divided, into, four, classes, type, i, iv, based, on, the, mechanisms, involved, and, the, time, course, of, the, hypersensitive, reaction, type, i, hypersensitivity, is, an, immediate, or, anaphylactic, reaction, often, associated, with, allergy, symptoms, can, range, from, mild, discomfort, to, death, type, i, hypersensitivity, is, mediated, by, ige, which, triggers, degranulation, of, mast, cells, and, basophils, when, cross, linked, by, antigen, type, ii, hypersensitivity, occurs, when, antibodies, bind, to, antigens, on, the, individual, s, own, cells, marking, them, for, destruction, this, is, also, called, antibody, dependent, or, cytotoxic, hypersensitivity, and, is, mediated, by, igg, and, igm, antibodies, immune, complexes, aggregations, of, antigens, complement, proteins, and, igg, and, igm, antibodies, deposited, in, various, tissues, trigger, type, iii, hypersensitivity, reactions, type, iv, hypersensitivity, also, known, as, cell, mediated, or, delayed, type, hypersensitivity, usually, takes, between, two, and, three, days, to, develop, type, iv, reactions, are, involved, in, many, autoimmune, and, infectious, diseases, but, may, also, involve, contact, dermatitis, these, reactions, are, mediated, by, t, cells, monocytes, and, macrophages, inflammation, is, one, of, the, first, responses, of, the, immune, system, to, infection, but, it, can, appear, without, known, cause, inflammation, is, produced, by, eicosanoids, and, cytokines, which, are, released, by, injured, or, infected, cells, eicosanoids, include, prostaglandins, that, produce, fever, and, the, dilation, of, blood, vessels, associated, with, inflammation, and, leukotrienes, that, attract, certain, white, blood, cells, leukocytes, common, cytokines, include, interleukins, that, are, responsible, for, communication, between, white, blood, cells, chemokines, that, promote, chemotaxis, and, interferons, that, have, anti, viral, effects, such, as, shutting, down, protein, synthesis, in, the, host, cell, growth, factors, and, cytotoxic, factors, may, also, be, released, these, cytokines, and, other, chemicals, recruit, immune, cells, to, the, site, of, infection, and, promote, healing, of, any, damaged, tissue, following, the, removal, of, pathogens, the, immune, response, can, be, manipulated, to, suppress, unwanted, responses, resulting, from, autoimmunity, allergy, and, transplant, rejection, and, to, stimulate, protective, responses, against, pathogens, that, largely, elude, the, immune, system, see, immunization, or, cancer, immunosuppressive, drugs, are, used, to, control, autoimmune, disorders, or, inflammation, when, excessive, tissue, damage, occurs, and, to, prevent, rejection, after, an, organ, transplant, anti, inflammatory, drugs, are, often, used, to, control, the, effects, of, inflammation, glucocorticoids, are, the, most, powerful, of, these, drugs, and, can, have, many, undesirable, side, effects, such, as, central, obesity, hyperglycemia, and, osteoporosis, their, use, is, tightly, controlled, lower, doses, of, anti, inflammatory, drugs, are, often, used, in, conjunction, with, cytotoxic, or, immunosuppressive, drugs, such, as, methotrexate, or, azathioprine, cytotoxic, drugs, inhibit, the, immune, response, by, killing, dividing, cells, such, as, activated, t, cells, this, killing, is, indiscriminate, and, other, constantly, dividing, cells, and, their, organs, are, affected, which, causes, toxic, side, effects, immunosuppressive, drugs, such, as, cyclosporin, prevent, t, cells, from, responding, to, signals, correctly, by, inhibiting, signal, transduction, pathways, claims, made, by, marketers, of, various, products, and, alternative, health, providers, such, as, chiropractors, homeopaths, and, acupuncturists, to, be, able, to, stimulate, or, boost, the, immune, system, generally, lack, meaningful, explanation, and, evidence, of, effectiveness, long, term, active, memory, is, acquired, following, infection, by, activation, of, b, and, t, cells, active, immunity, can, also, be, generated, artificially, through, vaccination, the, principle, behind, vaccination, also, called, immunization, is, to, introduce, an, antigen, from, a, pathogen, to, stimulate, the, immune, system, and, develop, specific, immunity, against, that, particular, pathogen, without, causing, disease, associated, with, that, organism, this, deliberate, induction, of, an, immune, response, is, successful, because, it, exploits, the, natural, specificity, of, the, immune, system, as, well, as, its, inducibility, with, infectious, disease, remaining, one, of, the, leading, causes, of, death, in, the, human, population, vaccination, represents, the, most, effective, manipulation, of, the, immune, system, mankind, has, developed, many, vaccines, are, based, on, acellular, components, of, micro, organisms, including, harmless, toxin, components, since, many, antigens, derived, from, acellular, vaccines, do, not, strongly, induce, the, adaptive, response, most, bacterial, vaccines, are, provided, with, additional, adjuvants, that, activate, the, antigen, presenting, cells, of, the, innate, immune, system, and, maximize, immunogenicity, another, important, role, of, the, immune, system, is, to, identify, and, eliminate, tumors, this, is, called, immune, surveillance, the, transformed, cells, of, tumors, express, antigens, that, are, not, found, on, normal, cells, to, the, immune, system, these, antigens, appear, foreign, and, their, presence, causes, immune, cells, to, attack, the, transformed, tumor, cells, the, antigens, expressed, by, tumors, have, several, sources, some, are, derived, from, oncogenic, viruses, like, human, papillomavirus, which, causes, cancer, of, the, cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, mouth, and, throat, while, others, are, the, organism, s, own, proteins, that, occur, at, low, levels, in, normal, cells, but, reach, high, levels, in, tumor, cells, one, example, is, an, enzyme, called, tyrosinase, that, when, expressed, at, high, levels, transforms, certain, skin, cells, for, example, melanocytes, into, tumors, called, melanomas, a, third, possible, source, of, tumor, antigens, are, proteins, normally, important, for, regulating, cell, growth, and, survival, that, commonly, mutate, into, cancer, inducing, molecules, called, oncogenes, the, main, response, of, the, immune, system, to, tumors, is, to, destroy, the, abnormal, cells, using, killer, t, cells, sometimes, with, the, assistance, of, helper, t, cells, tumor, antigens, are, presented, on, mhc, class, i, molecules, in, a, similar, way, to, viral, antigens, this, allows, killer, t, cells, to, recognize, the, tumor, cell, as, abnormal, nk, cells, also, kill, tumorous, cells, in, a, similar, way, especially, if, the, tumor, cells, have, fewer, mhc, class, i, molecules, on, their, surface, than, normal, this, is, a, common, phenomenon, with, tumors, sometimes, antibodies, are, generated, against, tumor, cells, allowing, for, their, destruction, by, the, complement, system, some, tumors, evade, the, immune, system, and, go, on, to, become, cancers, tumor, cells, often, have, a, reduced, number, of, mhc, class, i, molecules, on, their, surface, thus, avoiding, detection, by, killer, t, cells, some, tumor, cells, also, release, products, that, inhibit, the, immune, response, for, example, by, secreting, the, cytokine, tgf, which, suppresses, the, activity, of, macrophages, and, lymphocytes, in, addition, immunological, tolerance, may, develop, against, tumor, antigens, so, the, immune, system, no, longer, attacks, the, tumor, cells, paradoxically, macrophages, can, promote, tumor, growth, when, tumor, cells, send, out, cytokines, that, attract, macrophages, which, then, generate, cytokines, and, growth, factors, such, as, tumor, necrosis, factor, alpha, that, nurture, tumor, development, or, promote, stem, cell, like, plasticity, in, addition, a, combination, of, hypoxia, in, the, tumor, and, a, cytokine, produced, by, macrophages, induces, tumor, cells, to, decrease, production, of, a, protein, that, blocks, metastasis, and, thereby, assists, spread, of, cancer, cells, anti, tumor, m1, macrophages, are, recruited, in, early, phases, to, tumor, development, but, are, progressively, differentiated, to, m2, with, pro, tumor, effect, an, immunosuppressor, switch, the, hypoxia, reduces, the, cytokine, production, for, the, anti, tumor, response, and, progressively, macrophages, acquire, pro, tumor, m2, functions, driven, by, the, tumor, microenvironment, including, il, 4, and, il, 10, cancer, immunotherapy, covers, the, medical, ways, to, stimulate, the, immune, system, to, attack, cancer, tumors, some, drugs, can, cause, a, neutralizing, immune, response, meaning, that, the, immune, system, produces, neutralizing, antibodies, that, counteract, the, action, of, the, drugs, particularly, if, the, drugs, are, administered, repeatedly, or, in, larger, doses, this, limits, the, effectiveness, of, drugs, based, on, larger, peptides, and, proteins, which, are, typically, larger, than, 6000, da, in, some, cases, the, drug, itself, is, not, immunogenic, but, may, be, co, administered, with, an, immunogenic, compound, as, is, sometimes, the, case, for, taxol, computational, methods, have, been, developed, to, predict, the, immunogenicity, of, peptides, and, proteins, which, are, particularly, useful, in, designing, therapeutic, antibodies, assessing, likely, virulence, of, mutations, in, viral, coat, particles, and, validation, of, proposed, peptide, based, drug, treatments, early, techniques, relied, mainly, on, the, observation, that, hydrophilic, amino, acids, are, overrepresented, in, epitope, regions, than, hydrophobic, amino, acids, however, more, recent, developments, rely, on, machine, learning, techniques, using, databases, of, existing, known, epitopes, usually, on, well, studied, virus, proteins, as, a, training, set, a, publicly, accessible, database, has, been, established, for, the, cataloguing, of, epitopes, from, pathogens, known, to, be, recognizable, by, b, cells, the, emerging, field, of, bioinformatics, based, studies, of, immunogenicity, is, referred, to, as, immunoinformatics, immunoproteomics, is, the, study, of, large, sets, of, proteins, proteomics, involved, in, the, immune, response, it, is, likely, that, a, multicomponent, adaptive, immune, system, arose, with, the, first, vertebrates, as, invertebrates, do, not, generate, lymphocytes, or, an, antibody, based, humoral, response, immune, systems, evolved, in, deuterostomes, as, shown, in, the, cladogram, echinoderms, hemichordates, cephalochordates, urochordates, jawless, fishes, jawed, fishes, and, tetrapods, many, species, however, use, mechanisms, that, appear, to, be, precursors, of, these, aspects, of, vertebrate, immunity, immune, systems, appear, even, in, the, structurally, simplest, forms, of, life, with, bacteria, using, a, unique, defense, mechanism, called, the, restriction, modification, system, to, protect, themselves, from, viral, pathogens, called, bacteriophages, prokaryotes, bacteria, and, archea, also, possess, acquired, immunity, through, a, system, that, uses, crispr, sequences, to, retain, fragments, of, the, genomes, of, phage, that, they, have, come, into, contact, with, in, the, past, which, allows, them, to, block, virus, replication, through, a, form, of, rna, interference, prokaryotes, also, possess, other, defense, mechanisms, offensive, elements, of, the, immune, systems, are, also, present, in, unicellular, eukaryotes, but, studies, of, their, roles, in, defense, are, few, pattern, recognition, receptors, are, proteins, used, by, nearly, all, organisms, to, identify, molecules, associated, with, pathogens, antimicrobial, peptides, called, defensins, are, an, evolutionarily, conserved, component, of, the, innate, immune, response, found, in, all, animals, and, plants, and, represent, the, main, form, of, invertebrate, systemic, immunity, the, complement, system, and, phagocytic, cells, are, also, used, by, most, forms, of, invertebrate, life, ribonucleases, and, the, rna, interference, pathway, are, conserved, across, all, eukaryotes, and, are, thought, to, play, a, role, in, the, immune, response, to, viruses, unlike, animals, plants, lack, phagocytic, cells, but, many, plant, immune, responses, involve, systemic, chemical, signals, that, are, sent, through, a, plant, individual, plant, cells, respond, to, molecules, associated, with, pathogens, known, as, pathogen, associated, molecular, patterns, or, pamps, when, a, part, of, a, plant, becomes, infected, the, plant, produces, a, localized, hypersensitive, response, whereby, cells, at, the, site, of, infection, undergo, rapid, apoptosis, to, prevent, the, spread, of, the, disease, to, other, parts, of, the, plant, systemic, acquired, resistance, is, a, type, of, defensive, response, used, by, plants, that, renders, the, entire, plant, resistant, to, a, particular, infectious, agent, rna, silencing, mechanisms, are, particularly, important, in, this, systemic, response, as, they, can, block, virus, replication, evolution, of, the, adaptive, immune, system, occurred, in, an, ancestor, of, the, jawed, vertebrates, many, of, the, classical, molecules, of, the, adaptive, immune, system, for, example, immunoglobulins, and, t, cell, receptors, exist, only, in, jawed, vertebrates, a, distinct, lymphocyte, derived, molecule, has, been, discovered, in, primitive, jawless, vertebrates, such, as, the, lamprey, and, hagfish, these, animals, possess, a, large, array, of, molecules, called, variable, lymphocyte, receptors, vlrs, that, like, the, antigen, receptors, of, jawed, vertebrates, are, produced, from, only, a, small, number, one, or, two, of, genes, these, molecules, are, believed, to, bind, pathogenic, antigens, in, a, similar, way, to, antibodies, and, with, the, same, degree, of, specificity, the, success, of, any, pathogen, depends, on, its, ability, to, elude, host, immune, responses, therefore, pathogens, evolved, several, methods, that, allow, them, to, successfully, infect, a, host, while, evading, detection, or, destruction, by, the, immune, system, bacteria, often, overcome, physical, barriers, by, secreting, enzymes, that, digest, the, barrier, for, example, by, using, a, type, ii, secretion, system, alternatively, using, a, type, iii, secretion, system, they, may, insert, a, hollow, tube, into, the, host, cell, providing, a, direct, route, for, proteins, to, move, from, the, pathogen, to, the, host, these, proteins, are, often, used, to, shut, down, host, defenses, an, evasion, strategy, used, by, several, pathogens, to, avoid, the, innate, immune, system, is, to, hide, within, the, cells, of, their, host, also, called, intracellular, pathogenesis, here, a, pathogen, spends, most, of, its, life, cycle, inside, host, cells, where, it, is, shielded, from, direct, contact, with, immune, cells, antibodies, and, complement, some, examples, of, intracellular, pathogens, include, viruses, the, food, poisoning, bacterium, salmonella, and, the, eukaryotic, parasites, that, cause, malaria, plasmodium, spp, and, leishmaniasis, leishmania, spp, other, bacteria, such, as, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, live, inside, a, protective, capsule, that, prevents, lysis, by, complement, many, pathogens, secrete, compounds, that, diminish, or, misdirect, the, host, s, immune, response, some, bacteria, form, biofilms, to, protect, themselves, from, the, cells, and, proteins, of, the, immune, system, such, biofilms, are, present, in, many, successful, infections, such, as, the, chronic, pseudomonas, aeruginosa, and, burkholderia, cenocepacia, infections, characteristic, of, cystic, fibrosis, other, bacteria, generate, surface, proteins, that, bind, to, antibodies, rendering, them, ineffective, examples, include, streptococcus, protein, g, staphylococcus, aureus, protein, a, and, peptostreptococcus, magnus, protein, l, the, mechanisms, used, to, evade, the, adaptive, immune, system, are, more, complicated, the, simplest, approach, is, to, rapidly, change, non, essential, epitopes, amino, acids, and, or, sugars, on, the, surface, of, the, pathogen, while, keeping, essential, epitopes, concealed, this, is, called, antigenic, variation, an, example, is, hiv, which, mutates, rapidly, so, the, proteins, on, its, viral, envelope, that, are, essential, for, entry, into, its, host, target, cell, are, constantly, changing, these, frequent, changes, in, antigens, may, explain, the, failures, of, vaccines, directed, at, this, virus, the, parasite, trypanosoma, brucei, uses, a, similar, strategy, constantly, switching, one, type, of, surface, protein, for, another, allowing, it, to, stay, one, step, ahead, of, the, antibody, response, masking, antigens, with, host, molecules, is, another, common, strategy, for, avoiding, detection, by, the, immune, system, in, hiv, the, envelope, that, covers, the, virion, is, formed, from, the, outermost, membrane, of, the, host, cell, such, self, cloaked, viruses, make, it, difficult, for, the, immune, system, to, identify, them, as, non, self, structures, immunology, is, a, science, that, examines, the, structure, and, function, of, the, immune, system, it, originates, from, medicine, and, early, studies, on, the, causes, of, immunity, to, disease, the, earliest, known, reference, to, immunity, was, during, the, plague, of, athens, in, 430, bc, thucydides, noted, that, people, who, had, recovered, from, a, previous, bout, of, the, disease, could, nurse, the, sick, without, contracting, the, illness, a, second, time, in, the, 18th, century, pierre, louis, moreau, de, maupertuis, experimented, with, scorpion, venom, and, observed, that, certain, dogs, and, mice, were, immune, to, this, venom, in, the, 10th, century, persian, physician, al, razi, also, known, as, rhazes, wrote, the, first, recorded, theory, of, acquired, immunity, noting, that, a, smallpox, bout, protected, its, survivors, from, future, infections, although, he, explained, the, immunity, in, terms, of, excess, moisture, being, expelled, from, the, blood, therefore, preventing, a, second, occurrence, of, the, disease, this, theory, explained, many, observations, about, smallpox, known, during, this, time, these, and, other, observations, of, acquired, immunity, were, later, exploited, by, louis, pasteur, in, his, development, of, vaccination, and, his, proposed, germ, theory, of, disease, pasteur, s, theory, was, in, direct, opposition, to, contemporary, theories, of, disease, such, as, the, miasma, theory, it, was, not, until, robert, koch, s, 1891, proofs, for, which, he, was, awarded, a, nobel, prize, in, 1905, that, microorganisms, were, confirmed, as, the, cause, of, infectious, disease, viruses, were, confirmed, as, human, pathogens, in, 1901, with, the, discovery, of, the, yellow, fever, virus, by, walter, reed, immunology, made, a, great, advance, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, through, rapid, developments, in, the, study, of, humoral, immunity, and, cellular, immunity, particularly, important, was, the, work, of, paul, ehrlich, who, proposed, the, side, chain, theory, to, explain, the, specificity, of, the, antigen, antibody, reaction, his, contributions, to, the, understanding, of, humoral, immunity, were, recognized, by, the, award, of, a, joint, nobel, prize, in, 1908, along, with, the, founder, of, cellular, immunology, elie, metchnikoff, in, 1974, niels, kaj, jerne, developed, the, immune, network, theory, he, shared, a, nobel, prize, in, 1984, with, georges, j, f, k, hler, and, c, sar, milstein, for, theories, related, to, the, immune, system
