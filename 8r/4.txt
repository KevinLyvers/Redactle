an, organism, is, defined, in, a, medical, dictionary, as, any, living, thing, that, functions, as, an, individual, such, a, definition, raises, more, problems, than, it, solves, not, least, because, the, concept, of, an, individual, is, also, difficult, many, criteria, few, of, them, widely, accepted, have, been, proposed, to, define, what, an, organism, is, among, the, most, common, is, that, an, organism, has, autonomous, reproduction, growth, and, metabolism, this, would, exclude, viruses, despite, the, fact, that, they, evolve, like, organisms, other, problematic, cases, include, colonial, organisms, a, colony, of, eusocial, insects, is, organised, adaptively, and, has, germ, soma, specialisation, with, some, insects, reproducing, others, not, like, cells, in, an, animal, s, body, the, body, of, a, siphonophore, a, jelly, like, marine, animal, is, composed, of, organism, like, zooids, but, the, whole, structure, looks, and, functions, much, like, an, animal, such, as, a, jellyfish, the, parts, collaborating, to, provide, the, functions, of, the, colonial, organism, the, evolutionary, biologists, david, queller, and, joan, strassmann, state, that, organismality, the, qualities, or, attributes, that, define, an, entity, as, an, organism, has, evolved, socially, as, groups, of, simpler, units, from, cells, upwards, came, to, cooperate, without, conflicts, they, propose, that, cooperation, should, be, used, as, the, defining, trait, of, an, organism, this, would, treat, many, types, of, collaboration, including, the, fungus, alga, partnership, of, different, species, in, a, lichen, or, the, permanent, sexual, partnership, of, an, anglerfish, as, an, organism, the, term, organism, from, the, ancient, greek, derived, from, rganon, meaning, instrument, implement, tool, organ, of, sense, or, apprehension, first, appeared, in, the, english, language, in, the, 1660s, with, the, now, obsolete, meaning, of, an, organic, structure, or, organization, it, is, related, to, the, verb, organize, in, his, 1790, critique, of, judgment, immanuel, kant, defined, an, organism, as, both, an, organized, and, a, self, organizing, being, among, the, criteria, that, have, been, proposed, for, being, an, organism, are, other, scientists, think, that, the, concept, of, the, organism, is, inadequate, in, biology, that, the, concept, of, individuality, is, problematic, and, from, a, philosophical, point, of, view, question, whether, such, a, definition, is, necessary, problematic, cases, include, colonial, organisms, for, instance, a, colony, of, eusocial, insects, fulfills, criteria, such, as, adaptive, organisation, and, germ, soma, specialisation, if, so, the, same, argument, or, a, criterion, of, high, co, operation, and, low, conflict, would, include, some, mutualistic, e, g, lichens, and, sexual, partnerships, e, g, anglerfish, as, organisms, if, group, selection, occurs, then, a, group, could, be, viewed, as, a, superorganism, optimized, by, group, adaptation, another, view, is, that, attributes, like, autonomy, genetic, homogeneity, and, genetic, uniqueness, should, be, examined, separately, rather, than, demanding, that, an, organism, should, have, all, of, them, if, so, there, are, multiple, dimensions, to, biological, individuality, resulting, in, several, types, of, organism, a, unicellular, organism, is, a, microorganism, such, as, a, protist, bacterium, or, archaean, composed, of, a, single, cell, which, may, contain, functional, structures, called, organelles, a, multicellular, organism, such, as, an, animal, plant, fungus, or, alga, is, composed, of, many, cells, often, specialised, a, colonial, organism, such, as, a, siphonophore, is, a, being, which, functions, as, an, individual, but, is, composed, of, communicating, individuals, a, superorganism, is, a, colony, such, as, of, ants, consisting, of, many, individuals, working, together, as, a, single, functional, or, social, unit, a, mutualism, is, a, partnership, of, two, or, more, species, which, each, provide, some, of, the, needs, of, the, other, a, lichen, consists, of, fungi, and, algae, or, cyanobacteria, with, a, bacterial, microbiome, together, they, are, able, to, flourish, as, a, kind, of, organism, the, components, having, different, functions, in, habitats, such, as, dry, rocks, where, neither, could, grow, alone, the, evolutionary, biologists, david, queller, and, joan, strassmann, state, that, organismality, has, evolved, socially, as, groups, of, simpler, units, from, cells, upwards, came, to, cooperate, without, conflicts, they, propose, that, cooperation, should, be, used, as, the, defining, trait, of, an, organism, samuel, d, az, mu, oz, and, colleagues, 2016, accept, queller, and, strassmann, s, view, that, organismality, can, be, measured, wholly, by, degrees, of, cooperation, and, of, conflict, they, state, that, this, situates, organisms, in, evolutionary, time, so, that, organismality, is, context, dependent, they, suggest, that, highly, integrated, life, forms, which, are, not, context, dependent, may, evolve, through, context, dependent, stages, towards, complete, unification, viruses, are, not, typically, considered, to, be, organisms, because, they, are, incapable, of, autonomous, reproduction, growth, metabolism, or, homeostasis, although, viruses, have, a, few, enzymes, and, molecules, like, those, in, living, organisms, they, have, no, metabolism, of, their, own, they, cannot, synthesize, the, organic, compounds, from, which, they, are, formed, in, this, sense, they, are, similar, to, inanimate, matter, viruses, have, their, own, genes, and, they, evolve, thus, an, argument, that, viruses, should, be, classed, as, living, organisms, is, their, ability, to, undergo, evolution, and, replicate, through, self, assembly, however, some, scientists, argue, that, viruses, neither, evolve, nor, self, reproduce, instead, viruses, are, evolved, by, their, host, cells, meaning, that, there, was, co, evolution, of, viruses, and, host, cells, if, host, cells, did, not, exist, viral, evolution, would, be, impossible, as, for, reproduction, viruses, rely, on, hosts, machinery, to, replicate, the, discovery, of, viruses, with, genes, coding, for, energy, metabolism, and, protein, synthesis, fuelled, the, debate, about, whether, viruses, are, living, organisms, but, the, genes, have, a, cellular, origin, most, likely, they, were, acquired, through, horizontal, gene, transfer, from, viral, hosts, there, is, an, argument, for, viewing, viruses, as, cellular, organisms, some, researchers, perceive, viruses, not, as, virions, alone, which, they, believe, are, just, spores, of, an, organism, but, as, a, virocell, an, ontologically, mature, viral, organism, that, has, cellular, structure, such, virus, is, a, result, of, infection, of, a, cell, and, shows, all, major, physiological, properties, of, other, organisms, metabolism, growth, and, reproduction, therefore, life, in, its, effective, presence, the, philosopher, jack, a, wilson, examines, some, boundary, cases, to, demonstrate, that, the, concept, of, organism, is, not, sharply, defined, in, his, view, sponges, lichens, siphonophores, slime, moulds, and, eusocial, colonies, such, as, those, of, ants, or, naked, molerats, all, lie, in, the, boundary, zone, between, being, definite, colonies, and, definite, organisms, or, superorganisms, scientists, and, bio, engineers, are, experimenting, with, different, types, of, synthetic, organism, from, chimaeras, composed, of, cells, from, two, or, more, species, cyborgs, including, electromechanical, limbs, hybrots, containing, both, electronic, and, biological, elements, and, other, combinations, of, systems, that, have, variously, evolved, and, been, designed, an, evolved, organism, takes, its, form, by, the, partially, understood, mechanisms, of, evolutionary, developmental, biology, in, which, the, genome, directs, an, elaborated, series, of, interactions, to, produce, successively, more, elaborate, structures, the, existence, of, chimaeras, and, hybrids, demonstrates, that, these, mechanisms, are, intelligently, robust, in, the, face, of, radically, altered, circumstances, at, all, levels, from, molecular, to, organismal, synthetic, organisms, already, take, diverse, forms, and, their, diversity, will, increase, what, they, all, have, in, common, is, a, teleonomic, or, goal, seeking, behaviour, that, enables, them, to, correct, errors, of, many, kinds, so, as, to, achieve, whatever, result, they, are, designed, for, such, behaviour, is, reminiscent, of, intelligent, action, by, organisms, intelligence, is, seen, as, an, embodied, form, of, cognition, all, organisms, that, exist, today, possess, a, self, replicating, informational, molecule, genome, and, such, an, informational, molecule, is, likely, intrinsic, to, life, thus, the, earliest, organisms, also, presumably, possessed, a, self, replicating, informational, molecule, genome, perhaps, rna, or, an, informational, molecule, more, primitive, than, rna, the, specific, nucleotide, sequences, in, all, currently, extant, organisms, contain, information, that, functions, to, promote, survival, reproduction, and, the, ability, to, acquire, resources, necessary, for, reproduction, and, sequences, with, such, functions, probably, emerged, early, in, the, evolution, of, life, it, is, also, likely, that, survival, sequences, present, early, in, the, evolution, of, organisms, included, sequences, that, facilitate, the, avoidance, of, damage, to, the, self, replicating, molecule, and, promote, the, capability, to, repair, such, damages, that, do, occur, repair, of, some, of, the, genome, damages, in, these, early, organisms, may, have, involved, the, capacity, to, use, undamaged, information, from, another, similar, genome, by, a, process, of, recombination, a, primitive, form, of, sexual, interaction
