amino, acids, are, organic, compounds, that, contain, both, amino, and, carboxylic, acid, functional, groups, although, over, 500, amino, acids, exist, in, nature, by, far, the, most, important, are, the, 22, amino, acids, incorporated, into, proteins, only, these, 22, appear, in, the, genetic, code, of, life, amino, acids, can, be, classified, according, to, the, locations, of, the, core, structural, functional, groups, alpha, beta, gamma, amino, acids, etc, other, categories, relate, to, polarity, ionization, and, side, chain, group, type, aliphatic, acyclic, aromatic, polar, etc, in, the, form, of, proteins, amino, acid, residues, form, the, second, largest, component, water, being, the, largest, of, human, muscles, and, other, tissues, beyond, their, role, as, residues, in, proteins, amino, acids, participate, in, a, number, of, processes, such, as, neurotransmitter, transport, and, biosynthesis, it, is, thought, that, they, played, a, key, role, in, enabling, life, on, earth, and, its, emergence, amino, acids, are, formally, named, by, the, iupac, iubmb, joint, commission, on, biochemical, nomenclature, in, terms, of, the, fictitious, neutral, structure, shown, in, the, illustration, for, example, the, systematic, name, of, alanine, is, 2, aminopropanoic, acid, based, on, the, formula, ch, 3, ch, nh, 2, cooh, the, commission, justified, this, approach, as, follows, the, systematic, names, and, formulas, given, refer, to, hypothetical, forms, in, which, amino, groups, are, unprotonated, and, carboxyl, groups, are, undissociated, this, convention, is, useful, to, avoid, various, nomenclatural, problems, but, should, not, be, taken, to, imply, that, these, structures, represent, an, appreciable, fraction, of, the, amino, acid, molecules, the, first, few, amino, acids, were, discovered, in, the, early, 1800s, in, 1806, french, chemists, louis, nicolas, vauquelin, and, pierre, jean, robiquet, isolated, a, compound, from, asparagus, that, was, subsequently, named, asparagine, the, first, amino, acid, to, be, discovered, cystine, was, discovered, in, 1810, although, its, monomer, cysteine, remained, undiscovered, until, 1884, glycine, and, leucine, were, discovered, in, 1820, the, last, of, the, 20, common, amino, acids, to, be, discovered, was, threonine, in, 1935, by, william, cumming, rose, who, also, determined, the, essential, amino, acids, and, established, the, minimum, daily, requirements, of, all, amino, acids, for, optimal, growth, the, unity, of, the, chemical, category, was, recognized, by, wurtz, in, 1865, but, he, gave, no, particular, name, to, it, the, first, use, of, the, term, amino, acid, in, the, english, language, dates, from, 1898, while, the, german, term, aminos, ure, was, used, earlier, proteins, were, found, to, yield, amino, acids, after, enzymatic, digestion, or, acid, hydrolysis, in, 1902, emil, fischer, and, franz, hofmeister, independently, proposed, that, proteins, are, formed, from, many, amino, acids, whereby, bonds, are, formed, between, the, amino, group, of, one, amino, acid, with, the, carboxyl, group, of, another, resulting, in, a, linear, structure, that, fischer, termed, peptide, 2, alpha, or, amino, acids, have, the, generic, formula, h, 2, nchrcooh, in, most, cases, where, r, is, an, organic, substituent, known, as, a, side, chain, of, the, many, hundreds, of, described, amino, acids, 22, are, proteinogenic, protein, building, it, is, these, 22, compounds, that, combine, to, give, a, vast, array, of, peptides, and, proteins, assembled, by, ribosomes, non, proteinogenic, or, modified, amino, acids, may, arise, from, post, translational, modification, or, during, nonribosomal, peptide, synthesis, the, carbon, atom, next, to, the, carboxyl, group, is, called, the, carbon, in, proteinogenic, amino, acids, it, bears, the, amine, and, the, r, group, or, side, chain, specific, to, each, amino, acid, with, four, distinct, substituents, the, carbon, is, stereogenic, in, all, amino, acids, except, glycine, all, chiral, proteogenic, amino, acids, have, the, l, configuration, they, are, left, handed, enantiomers, which, refers, to, the, stereoisomers, of, the, alpha, carbon, a, few, d, amino, acids, right, handed, have, been, found, in, nature, e, g, in, bacterial, envelopes, as, a, neuromodulator, d, serine, and, in, some, antibiotics, rarely, d, amino, acid, residues, are, found, in, proteins, and, are, converted, from, the, l, amino, acid, as, a, post, translational, modification, five, amino, acids, possess, a, charge, at, neutral, ph, often, these, side, chains, appear, at, the, surfaces, on, proteins, to, enable, their, solubility, in, water, and, side, chains, with, opposite, charges, form, important, electrostatic, contacts, called, salt, bridges, that, maintain, structures, within, a, single, protein, or, between, interfacing, proteins, many, proteins, bind, metal, into, their, structures, specifically, and, these, interactions, are, commonly, mediated, by, charged, side, chains, such, as, aspartate, glutamate, and, histidine, under, certain, conditions, each, ion, forming, group, can, be, charged, forming, double, salts, the, two, negatively, charged, amino, acids, at, neutral, ph, are, aspartate, asp, d, and, glutamate, glu, e, the, anionic, carboxylate, groups, behave, as, br, nsted, bases, in, most, circumstances, enzymes, in, very, low, ph, environments, like, the, aspartic, protease, pepsin, in, mammalian, stomachs, may, have, catalytic, aspartate, or, glutamate, residues, that, act, as, br, nsted, acids, there, are, three, amino, acids, with, side, chains, that, are, cations, at, neutral, ph, arginine, arg, r, lysine, lys, k, and, histidine, his, h, arginine, has, a, charged, guanidino, group, and, lysine, a, charged, alkyl, amino, group, and, are, fully, protonated, at, ph, 7, histidine, s, imidazole, group, has, a, pk, a, of, 6, 0, and, is, only, around, 10, protonated, at, neutral, ph, because, histidine, is, easily, found, in, its, basic, and, conjugate, acid, forms, it, often, participates, in, catalytic, proton, transfers, in, enzyme, reactions, the, polar, uncharged, amino, acids, serine, ser, s, threonine, thr, t, asparagine, asn, n, and, glutamine, gln, q, readily, form, hydrogen, bonds, with, water, and, other, amino, acids, they, do, not, ionize, in, normal, conditions, a, prominent, exception, being, the, catalytic, serine, in, serine, proteases, this, is, an, example, of, severe, perturbation, and, is, not, characteristic, of, serine, residues, in, general, threonine, has, two, chiral, centers, not, only, the, l, 2, s, chiral, center, at, the, carbon, shared, by, all, amino, acids, apart, from, achiral, glycine, but, also, 3, r, at, the, carbon, the, full, stereochemical, specification, is, 2, s, 3, r, l, threonine, nonpolar, amino, acid, interactions, are, the, primary, driving, force, behind, the, processes, that, fold, proteins, into, their, functional, three, dimensional, structures, none, of, these, amino, acids, side, chains, ionize, easily, and, therefore, do, not, have, pk, a, s, with, the, exception, of, tyrosine, tyr, y, the, hydroxyl, of, tyrosine, can, deprotonate, at, high, ph, forming, the, negatively, charged, phenolate, because, of, this, one, could, place, tyrosine, into, the, polar, uncharged, amino, acid, category, but, its, very, low, solubility, in, water, matches, the, characteristics, of, hydrophobic, amino, acids, well, several, side, chains, are, not, described, well, by, the, charged, polar, and, hydrophobic, categories, glycine, gly, g, could, be, considered, a, polar, amino, acid, since, its, small, size, means, that, its, solubility, is, largely, determined, by, the, amino, and, carboxylate, groups, however, the, lack, of, any, side, chain, provides, glycine, with, a, unique, flexibility, among, amino, acids, with, large, ramifications, to, protein, folding, cysteine, cys, c, can, also, form, hydrogen, bonds, readily, which, would, place, it, in, the, polar, amino, acid, category, though, it, can, often, be, found, in, protein, structures, forming, covalent, bonds, called, disulphide, bonds, with, other, cysteines, these, bonds, influence, the, folding, and, stability, of, proteins, and, are, essential, in, the, formation, of, antibodies, proline, pro, p, has, an, alkyl, side, chain, and, could, be, considered, hydrophobic, but, because, the, side, chain, joins, back, onto, the, alpha, amino, group, it, becomes, particularly, inflexible, when, incorporated, into, proteins, similar, to, glycine, this, influences, protein, structure, in, a, way, unique, among, amino, acids, selenocysteine, sec, u, is, a, rare, amino, acid, not, directly, encoded, by, dna, but, is, incorporated, into, proteins, via, the, ribosome, selenocysteine, has, a, lower, redox, potential, compared, to, the, similar, cysteine, and, participates, in, several, unique, enzymatic, reactions, pyrrolysine, pyl, o, is, another, amino, acid, not, encoded, in, dna, but, synthesized, into, protein, by, ribosomes, it, is, found, in, archaeal, species, where, it, participates, in, the, catalytic, activity, of, several, methyltransferases, amino, acids, with, the, structure, nh, 3, cxy, cxy, co, 2, such, as, alanine, a, component, of, carnosine, and, a, few, other, peptides, are, amino, acids, ones, with, the, structure, nh, 3, cxy, cxy, cxy, co, 2, are, amino, acids, and, so, on, where, x, and, y, are, two, substituents, one, of, which, is, normally, h, the, common, natural, forms, of, amino, acids, have, a, zwitterionic, structure, with, nh, 3, nh, 2, in, the, case, of, proline, and, co, 2, functional, groups, attached, to, the, same, c, atom, and, are, thus, amino, acids, and, are, the, only, ones, found, in, proteins, during, translation, in, the, ribosome, in, aqueous, solution, at, ph, close, to, neutrality, amino, acids, exist, as, zwitterions, i, e, as, dipolar, ions, with, both, nh, 3, and, co, 2, in, charged, states, so, the, overall, structure, is, nh, 3, chr, co, 2, at, physiological, ph, the, so, called, neutral, forms, nh, 2, chr, co, 2, h, are, not, present, to, any, measurable, degree, although, the, two, charges, in, the, zwitterion, structure, add, up, to, zero, it, is, misleading, to, call, a, species, with, a, net, charge, of, zero, uncharged, in, strongly, acidic, conditions, ph, below, 3, the, carboxylate, group, becomes, protonated, and, the, structure, becomes, an, ammonio, carboxylic, acid, nh, 3, chr, co, 2, h, this, is, relevant, for, enzymes, like, pepsin, that, are, active, in, acidic, environments, such, as, the, mammalian, stomach, and, lysosomes, but, does, not, significantly, apply, to, intracellular, enzymes, in, highly, basic, conditions, ph, greater, than, 10, not, normally, seen, in, physiological, conditions, the, ammonio, group, is, deprotonated, to, give, nh, 2, chr, co, 2, although, various, definitions, of, acids, and, bases, are, used, in, chemistry, the, only, one, that, is, useful, for, chemistry, in, aqueous, solution, is, that, of, br, nsted, an, acid, is, a, species, that, can, donate, a, proton, to, another, species, and, a, base, is, one, that, can, accept, a, proton, this, criterion, is, used, to, label, the, groups, in, the, above, illustration, the, carboxylate, side, chains, of, aspartate, and, glutamate, residues, are, the, principal, br, nsted, bases, in, proteins, likewise, lysine, tyrosine, and, cysteine, will, typically, act, as, a, br, nsted, acid, histidine, under, these, conditions, can, act, both, as, a, br, nsted, acid, and, a, base, for, amino, acids, with, uncharged, side, chains, the, zwitterion, predominates, at, ph, values, between, the, two, p, k, a, values, but, coexists, in, equilibrium, with, small, amounts, of, net, negative, and, net, positive, ions, at, the, midpoint, between, the, two, p, k, a, values, the, trace, amount, of, net, negative, and, trace, of, net, positive, ions, balance, so, that, average, net, charge, of, all, forms, present, is, zero, this, ph, is, known, as, the, isoelectric, point, p, i, so, p, i, 1, 2, p, k, a1, p, k, a2, for, amino, acids, with, charged, side, chains, the, p, k, a, of, the, side, chain, is, involved, thus, for, aspartate, or, glutamate, with, negative, side, chains, the, terminal, amino, group, is, essentially, entirely, in, the, charged, form, nh, 3, but, this, positive, charge, needs, to, be, balanced, by, the, state, with, just, one, c, terminal, carboxylate, group, is, negatively, charged, this, occurs, halfway, between, the, two, carboxylate, p, k, a, values, p, i, 1, 2, p, k, a1, p, k, a, r, where, p, k, a, r, is, the, side, chain, p, k, a, similar, considerations, apply, to, other, amino, acids, with, ionizable, side, chains, including, not, only, glutamate, similar, to, aspartate, but, also, cysteine, histidine, lysine, tyrosine, and, arginine, with, positive, side, chains, amino, acids, have, zero, mobility, in, electrophoresis, at, their, isoelectric, point, although, this, behaviour, is, more, usually, exploited, for, peptides, and, proteins, than, single, amino, acids, zwitterions, have, minimum, solubility, at, their, isoelectric, point, and, some, amino, acids, in, particular, with, nonpolar, side, chains, can, be, isolated, by, precipitation, from, water, by, adjusting, the, ph, to, the, required, isoelectric, point, the, 20, canonical, amino, acids, can, be, classified, according, to, their, properties, important, factors, are, charge, hydrophilicity, or, hydrophobicity, size, and, functional, groups, these, properties, influence, protein, structure, and, protein, protein, interactions, the, water, soluble, proteins, tend, to, have, their, hydrophobic, residues, leu, ile, val, phe, and, trp, buried, in, the, middle, of, the, protein, whereas, hydrophilic, side, chains, are, exposed, to, the, aqueous, solvent, in, biochemistry, a, residue, refers, to, a, specific, monomer, within, the, polymeric, chain, of, a, polysaccharide, protein, or, nucleic, acid, the, integral, membrane, proteins, tend, to, have, outer, rings, of, exposed, hydrophobic, amino, acids, that, anchor, them, in, the, lipid, bilayer, some, peripheral, membrane, proteins, have, a, patch, of, hydrophobic, amino, acids, on, their, surface, that, sticks, to, the, membrane, in, a, similar, fashion, proteins, that, have, to, bind, to, positively, charged, molecules, have, surfaces, rich, in, negatively, charged, amino, acids, such, as, glutamate, and, aspartate, while, proteins, binding, to, negatively, charged, molecules, have, surfaces, rich, in, positively, charged, amino, acids, like, lysine, and, arginine, for, example, lysine, and, arginine, are, present, in, large, amounts, in, the, low, complexity, regions, of, nucleic, acid, binding, proteins, there, are, various, hydrophobicity, scales, of, amino, acid, residues, some, amino, acids, have, special, properties, cysteine, can, form, covalent, disulfide, bonds, to, other, cysteine, residues, proline, forms, a, cycle, to, the, polypeptide, backbone, and, glycine, is, more, flexible, than, other, amino, acids, glycine, and, proline, are, strongly, present, within, low, complexity, regions, of, both, eukaryotic, and, prokaryotic, proteins, whereas, the, opposite, is, the, case, with, cysteine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, which, are, highly, reactive, or, complex, or, hydrophobic, many, proteins, undergo, a, range, of, posttranslational, modifications, whereby, additional, chemical, groups, are, attached, to, the, amino, acid, residue, side, chains, sometimes, producing, lipoproteins, that, are, hydrophobic, or, glycoproteins, that, are, hydrophilic, allowing, the, protein, to, attach, temporarily, to, a, membrane, for, example, a, signaling, protein, can, attach, and, then, detach, from, a, cell, membrane, because, it, contains, cysteine, residues, that, can, have, the, fatty, acid, palmitic, acid, added, to, them, and, subsequently, removed, although, one, letter, symbols, are, included, in, the, table, iupac, iubmb, recommend, that, use, of, the, one, letter, symbols, should, be, restricted, to, the, comparison, of, long, sequences, the, one, letter, notation, was, chosen, by, iupac, iub, based, on, the, following, rules, two, additional, amino, acids, are, in, some, species, coded, for, by, codons, that, are, usually, interpreted, as, stop, codons, in, addition, to, the, specific, amino, acid, codes, placeholders, are, used, in, cases, where, chemical, or, crystallographic, analysis, of, a, peptide, or, protein, cannot, conclusively, determine, the, identity, of, a, residue, they, are, also, used, to, summarize, conserved, protein, sequence, motifs, the, use, of, single, letters, to, indicate, sets, of, similar, residues, is, similar, to, the, use, of, abbreviation, codes, for, degenerate, bases, unk, is, sometimes, used, instead, of, xaa, but, is, less, standard, ter, or, from, termination, is, used, in, notation, for, mutations, in, proteins, when, a, stop, codon, occurs, it, corresponds, to, no, amino, acid, at, all, in, addition, many, nonstandard, amino, acids, have, a, specific, code, for, example, several, peptide, drugs, such, as, bortezomib, and, mg132, are, artificially, synthesized, and, retain, their, protecting, groups, which, have, specific, codes, bortezomib, is, pyz, phe, boroleu, and, mg132, is, z, leu, leu, leu, al, to, aid, in, the, analysis, of, protein, structure, photo, reactive, amino, acid, analogs, are, available, these, include, photoleucine, pleu, and, photomethionine, pmet, amino, acids, are, the, precursors, to, proteins, they, join, by, condensation, reactions, to, form, short, polymer, chains, called, peptides, or, longer, chains, called, either, polypeptides, or, proteins, these, chains, are, linear, and, unbranched, with, each, amino, acid, residue, within, the, chain, attached, to, two, neighboring, amino, acids, in, nature, the, process, of, making, proteins, encoded, by, rna, genetic, material, is, called, translation, and, involves, the, step, by, step, addition, of, amino, acids, to, a, growing, protein, chain, by, a, ribozyme, that, is, called, a, ribosome, the, order, in, which, the, amino, acids, are, added, is, read, through, the, genetic, code, from, an, mrna, template, which, is, an, rna, derived, from, one, of, the, organism, s, genes, twenty, two, amino, acids, are, naturally, incorporated, into, polypeptides, and, are, called, proteinogenic, or, natural, amino, acids, of, these, 20, are, encoded, by, the, universal, genetic, code, the, remaining, 2, selenocysteine, and, pyrrolysine, are, incorporated, into, proteins, by, unique, synthetic, mechanisms, selenocysteine, is, incorporated, when, the, mrna, being, translated, includes, a, secis, element, which, causes, the, uga, codon, to, encode, selenocysteine, instead, of, a, stop, codon, pyrrolysine, is, used, by, some, methanogenic, archaea, in, enzymes, that, they, use, to, produce, methane, it, is, coded, for, with, the, codon, uag, which, is, normally, a, stop, codon, in, other, organisms, several, independent, evolutionary, studies, have, suggested, that, gly, ala, asp, val, ser, pro, glu, leu, thr, may, belong, to, a, group, of, amino, acids, that, constituted, the, early, genetic, code, whereas, cys, met, tyr, trp, his, phe, may, belong, to, a, group, of, amino, acids, that, constituted, later, additions, of, the, genetic, code, the, 20, amino, acids, that, are, encoded, directly, by, the, codons, of, the, universal, genetic, code, are, called, standard, or, canonical, amino, acids, a, modified, form, of, methionine, n, formylmethionine, is, often, incorporated, in, place, of, methionine, as, the, initial, amino, acid, of, proteins, in, bacteria, mitochondria, and, plastids, including, chloroplasts, other, amino, acids, are, called, nonstandard, or, non, canonical, most, of, the, nonstandard, amino, acids, are, also, non, proteinogenic, i, e, they, cannot, be, incorporated, into, proteins, during, translation, but, two, of, them, are, proteinogenic, as, they, can, be, incorporated, translationally, into, proteins, by, exploiting, information, not, encoded, in, the, universal, genetic, code, the, two, nonstandard, proteinogenic, amino, acids, are, selenocysteine, present, in, many, non, eukaryotes, as, well, as, most, eukaryotes, but, not, coded, directly, by, dna, and, pyrrolysine, found, only, in, some, archaea, and, at, least, one, bacterium, the, incorporation, of, these, nonstandard, amino, acids, is, rare, for, example, 25, human, proteins, include, selenocysteine, in, their, primary, structure, and, the, structurally, characterized, enzymes, selenoenzymes, employ, selenocysteine, as, the, catalytic, moiety, in, their, active, sites, pyrrolysine, and, selenocysteine, are, encoded, via, variant, codons, for, example, selenocysteine, is, encoded, by, stop, codon, and, secis, element, n, formylmethionine, which, is, often, the, initial, amino, acid, of, proteins, in, bacteria, mitochondria, and, chloroplasts, is, generally, considered, as, a, form, of, methionine, rather, than, as, a, separate, proteinogenic, amino, acid, codon, trna, combinations, not, found, in, nature, can, also, be, used, to, expand, the, genetic, code, and, form, novel, proteins, known, as, alloproteins, incorporating, non, proteinogenic, amino, acids, aside, from, the, 22, proteinogenic, amino, acids, many, non, proteinogenic, amino, acids, are, known, those, either, are, not, found, in, proteins, for, example, carnitine, gaba, levothyroxine, or, are, not, produced, directly, and, in, isolation, by, standard, cellular, machinery, for, example, hydroxyproline, is, synthesised, from, proline, another, example, is, selenomethionine, non, proteinogenic, amino, acids, that, are, found, in, proteins, are, formed, by, post, translational, modification, such, modifications, can, also, determine, the, localization, of, the, protein, e, g, the, addition, of, long, hydrophobic, groups, can, cause, a, protein, to, bind, to, a, phospholipid, membrane, examples, some, non, proteinogenic, amino, acids, are, not, found, in, proteins, examples, include, 2, aminoisobutyric, acid, and, the, neurotransmitter, gamma, aminobutyric, acid, non, proteinogenic, amino, acids, often, occur, as, intermediates, in, the, metabolic, pathways, for, standard, amino, acids, for, example, ornithine, and, citrulline, occur, in, the, urea, cycle, part, of, amino, acid, catabolism, see, below, a, rare, exception, to, the, dominance, of, amino, acids, in, biology, is, the, amino, acid, beta, alanine, 3, aminopropanoic, acid, which, is, used, in, plants, and, microorganisms, in, the, synthesis, of, pantothenic, acid, vitamin, b, 5, a, component, of, coenzyme, a, amino, acids, are, not, typical, component, of, food, animals, eat, proteins, the, protein, is, broken, down, into, amino, acids, in, the, process, of, digestion, they, are, then, used, to, synthesize, new, proteins, other, biomolecules, or, are, oxidized, to, urea, and, carbon, dioxide, as, a, source, of, energy, the, oxidation, pathway, starts, with, the, removal, of, the, amino, group, by, a, transaminase, the, amino, group, is, then, fed, into, the, urea, cycle, the, other, product, of, transamidation, is, a, keto, acid, that, enters, the, citric, acid, cycle, glucogenic, amino, acids, can, also, be, converted, into, glucose, through, gluconeogenesis, of, the, 20, standard, amino, acids, nine, his, ile, leu, lys, met, phe, thr, trp, and, val, are, called, essential, amino, acids, because, the, human, body, cannot, synthesize, them, from, other, compounds, at, the, level, needed, for, normal, growth, so, they, must, be, obtained, from, food, in, addition, cysteine, tyrosine, and, arginine, are, considered, semiessential, amino, acids, and, taurine, a, semi, essential, aminosulfonic, acid, in, children, some, amino, acids, are, conditionally, essential, for, certain, ages, or, medical, conditions, essential, amino, acids, may, also, vary, from, species, to, species, the, metabolic, pathways, that, synthesize, these, monomers, are, not, fully, developed, many, proteinogenic, and, non, proteinogenic, amino, acids, have, biological, functions, beyond, being, precursors, to, proteins, and, peptides, in, humans, amino, acids, also, have, important, roles, in, diverse, biosynthetic, pathways, defenses, against, herbivores, in, plants, sometimes, employ, amino, acids, examples, amino, acids, are, sometimes, added, to, animal, feed, because, some, of, the, components, of, these, feeds, such, as, soybeans, have, low, levels, of, some, of, the, essential, amino, acids, especially, of, lysine, methionine, threonine, and, tryptophan, likewise, amino, acids, are, used, to, chelate, metal, cations, in, order, to, improve, the, absorption, of, minerals, from, feed, supplements, the, food, industry, is, a, major, consumer, of, amino, acids, especially, glutamic, acid, which, is, used, as, a, flavor, enhancer, and, aspartame, aspartylphenylalanine, 1, methyl, ester, which, is, used, as, an, artificial, sweetener, amino, acids, are, sometimes, added, to, food, by, manufacturers, to, alleviate, symptoms, of, mineral, deficiencies, such, as, anemia, by, improving, mineral, absorption, and, reducing, negative, side, effects, from, inorganic, mineral, supplementation, amino, acids, are, low, cost, feedstocks, used, in, chiral, pool, synthesis, as, enantiomerically, pure, building, blocks, amino, acids, are, used, in, the, synthesis, of, some, cosmetics, the, chelating, ability, of, amino, acids, is, sometimes, used, in, fertilizers, to, facilitate, the, delivery, of, minerals, to, plants, in, order, to, correct, mineral, deficiencies, such, as, iron, chlorosis, these, fertilizers, are, also, used, to, prevent, deficiencies, from, occurring, and, to, improve, the, overall, health, of, the, plants, amino, acids, have, been, considered, as, components, of, biodegradable, polymers, which, have, applications, as, environmentally, friendly, packaging, and, in, medicine, in, drug, delivery, and, the, construction, of, prosthetic, implants, an, interesting, example, of, such, materials, is, polyaspartate, a, water, soluble, biodegradable, polymer, that, may, have, applications, in, disposable, diapers, and, agriculture, due, to, its, solubility, and, ability, to, chelate, metal, ions, polyaspartate, is, also, being, used, as, a, biodegradable, anti, scaling, agent, and, a, corrosion, inhibitor, the, commercial, production, of, amino, acids, usually, relies, on, mutant, bacteria, that, overproduce, individual, amino, acids, using, glucose, as, a, carbon, source, some, amino, acids, are, produced, by, enzymatic, conversions, of, synthetic, intermediates, 2, aminothiazoline, 4, carboxylic, acid, is, an, intermediate, in, one, industrial, synthesis, of, l, cysteine, for, example, aspartic, acid, is, produced, by, the, addition, of, ammonia, to, fumarate, using, a, lyase, in, plants, nitrogen, is, first, assimilated, into, organic, compounds, in, the, form, of, glutamate, formed, from, alpha, ketoglutarate, and, ammonia, in, the, mitochondrion, for, other, amino, acids, plants, use, transaminases, to, move, the, amino, group, from, glutamate, to, another, alpha, keto, acid, for, example, aspartate, aminotransferase, converts, glutamate, and, oxaloacetate, to, alpha, ketoglutarate, and, aspartate, other, organisms, use, transaminases, for, amino, acid, synthesis, too, nonstandard, amino, acids, are, usually, formed, through, modifications, to, standard, amino, acids, for, example, homocysteine, is, formed, through, the, transsulfuration, pathway, or, by, the, demethylation, of, methionine, via, the, intermediate, metabolite, s, adenosylmethionine, while, hydroxyproline, is, made, by, a, post, translational, modification, of, proline, microorganisms, and, plants, synthesize, many, uncommon, amino, acids, for, example, some, microbes, make, 2, aminoisobutyric, acid, and, lanthionine, which, is, a, sulfide, bridged, derivative, of, alanine, both, of, these, amino, acids, are, found, in, peptidic, lantibiotics, such, as, alamethicin, however, in, plants, 1, aminocyclopropane, 1, carboxylic, acid, is, a, small, disubstituted, cyclic, amino, acid, that, is, an, intermediate, in, the, production, of, the, plant, hormone, ethylene, the, formation, of, amino, acids, and, peptides, are, assumed, to, precede, and, perhaps, induce, the, emergence, of, life, on, earth, amino, acids, can, form, from, simple, precursors, under, various, conditions, surface, based, chemical, metabolism, of, amino, acids, and, very, small, compounds, may, have, led, to, the, build, up, of, amino, acids, coenzymes, and, phosphate, based, small, carbon, molecules, amino, acids, and, similar, building, blocks, could, have, been, elaborated, into, proto, peptides, with, peptides, being, considered, key, players, in, the, origin, of, life, in, the, famous, urey, miller, experiment, the, passage, of, an, electric, arc, through, a, mixture, of, methane, hydrogen, and, ammonia, produces, a, large, number, of, amino, acids, since, then, scientists, have, discovered, a, range, of, ways, and, components, by, which, the, potentially, prebiotic, formation, and, chemical, evolution, of, peptides, may, have, occurred, such, as, condensing, agents, the, design, of, self, replicating, peptides, and, a, number, of, non, enzymatic, mechanisms, by, which, amino, acids, could, have, emerged, and, elaborated, into, peptides, several, hypotheses, invoke, the, strecker, synthesis, whereby, hydrogen, cyanide, simple, aldehydes, ammonia, and, water, produce, amino, acids, according, to, a, review, amino, acids, and, even, peptides, turn, up, fairly, regularly, in, the, various, experimental, broths, that, have, been, allowed, to, be, cooked, from, simple, chemicals, this, is, because, nucleotides, are, far, more, difficult, to, synthesize, chemically, than, amino, acids, for, a, chronological, order, it, suggests, that, there, must, have, been, a, protein, world, or, at, least, a, polypeptide, world, possibly, later, followed, by, the, rna, world, and, the, dna, world, codon, amino, acids, mappings, may, be, the, biological, information, system, at, the, primordial, origin, of, life, on, earth, while, amino, acids, and, consequently, simple, peptides, must, have, formed, under, different, experimentally, probed, geochemical, scenarios, the, transition, from, an, abiotic, world, to, the, first, life, forms, is, to, a, large, extent, still, unresolved, amino, acids, undergo, the, reactions, expected, of, the, constituent, functional, groups, as, both, the, amine, and, carboxylic, acid, groups, of, amino, acids, can, react, to, form, amide, bonds, one, amino, acid, molecule, can, react, with, another, and, become, joined, through, an, amide, linkage, this, polymerization, of, amino, acids, is, what, creates, proteins, this, condensation, reaction, yields, the, newly, formed, peptide, bond, and, a, molecule, of, water, in, cells, this, reaction, does, not, occur, directly, instead, the, amino, acid, is, first, activated, by, attachment, to, a, transfer, rna, molecule, through, an, ester, bond, this, aminoacyl, trna, is, produced, in, an, atp, dependent, reaction, carried, out, by, an, aminoacyl, trna, synthetase, this, aminoacyl, trna, is, then, a, substrate, for, the, ribosome, which, catalyzes, the, attack, of, the, amino, group, of, the, elongating, protein, chain, on, the, ester, bond, as, a, result, of, this, mechanism, all, proteins, made, by, ribosomes, are, synthesized, starting, at, their, n, terminus, and, moving, toward, their, c, terminus, however, not, all, peptide, bonds, are, formed, in, this, way, in, a, few, cases, peptides, are, synthesized, by, specific, enzymes, for, example, the, tripeptide, glutathione, is, an, essential, part, of, the, defenses, of, cells, against, oxidative, stress, this, peptide, is, synthesized, in, two, steps, from, free, amino, acids, in, the, first, step, gamma, glutamylcysteine, synthetase, condenses, cysteine, and, glutamate, through, a, peptide, bond, formed, between, the, side, chain, carboxyl, of, the, glutamate, the, gamma, carbon, of, this, side, chain, and, the, amino, group, of, the, cysteine, this, dipeptide, is, then, condensed, with, glycine, by, glutathione, synthetase, to, form, glutathione, in, chemistry, peptides, are, synthesized, by, a, variety, of, reactions, one, of, the, most, used, in, solid, phase, peptide, synthesis, uses, the, aromatic, oxime, derivatives, of, amino, acids, as, activated, units, these, are, added, in, sequence, onto, the, growing, peptide, chain, which, is, attached, to, a, solid, resin, support, libraries, of, peptides, are, used, in, drug, discovery, through, high, throughput, screening, the, combination, of, functional, groups, allow, amino, acids, to, be, effective, polydentate, ligands, for, metal, amino, acid, chelates, the, multiple, side, chains, of, amino, acids, can, also, undergo, chemical, reactions, degradation, of, an, amino, acid, often, involves, deamination, by, moving, its, amino, group, to, ketoglutarate, forming, glutamate, this, process, involves, transaminases, often, the, same, as, those, used, in, amination, during, synthesis, in, many, vertebrates, the, amino, group, is, then, removed, through, the, urea, cycle, and, is, excreted, in, the, form, of, urea, however, amino, acid, degradation, can, produce, uric, acid, or, ammonia, instead, for, example, serine, dehydratase, converts, serine, to, pyruvate, and, ammonia, after, removal, of, one, or, more, amino, groups, the, remainder, of, the, molecule, can, sometimes, be, used, to, synthesize, new, amino, acids, or, it, can, be, used, for, energy, by, entering, glycolysis, or, the, citric, acid, cycle, as, detailed, in, image, at, right, amino, acids, are, bidentate, ligands, forming, transition, metal, amino, acid, complexes, the, total, nitrogen, content, of, organic, matter, is, mainly, formed, by, the, amino, groups, in, proteins, the, total, kjeldahl, nitrogen, tkn, is, a, measure, of, nitrogen, widely, used, in, the, analysis, of, waste, water, soil, food, feed, and, organic, matter, in, general, as, the, name, suggests, the, kjeldahl, method, is, applied, more, sensitive, methods, are, available, see, template, leucine, metabolism, in, humans, this, diagram, does, not, include, the, pathway, for, leucine, synthesis, via, leucine, 2, 3, aminomutase
