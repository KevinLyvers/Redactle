the, chestnuts, are, the, deciduous, trees, and, shrubs, in, the, genus, castanea, in, the, beech, family, fagaceae, the, name, also, refers, to, the, edible, nuts, they, produce, they, are, native, to, temperate, regions, of, the, northern, hemisphere, chestnut, trees, are, of, moderate, growth, rate, for, the, chinese, chestnut, tree, to, fast, growing, for, american, and, european, species, their, mature, heights, vary, from, the, smallest, species, of, chinkapins, often, shrubby, to, the, giant, of, past, american, forests, c, dentata, that, could, reach, 60, metres, 200, feet, between, these, extremes, are, found, the, japanese, chestnut, c, crenata, at, 10, m, average, followed, by, the, chinese, chestnut, c, mollissima, at, about, 15, m, then, the, european, chestnut, c, sativa, around, 30, m, the, chinese, and, more, so, the, japanese, chestnuts, are, both, often, multileadered, and, wide, spreading, whereas, european, and, especially, american, species, tend, to, grow, very, erect, when, planted, among, others, with, little, tapering, of, their, columnar, trunks, which, are, firmly, set, and, massive, when, standing, on, their, own, they, spread, on, the, sides, and, develop, broad, rounded, dense, crowns, at, maturity, the, foliage, of, the, european, and, american, species, has, striking, yellow, autumn, coloring, its, bark, is, smooth, when, young, of, a, vinous, maroon, or, red, brown, color, for, the, american, chestnut, grey, for, the, european, chestnut, with, age, american, species, bark, becomes, grey, and, darker, thick, and, deeply, furrowed, the, furrows, run, longitudinally, and, tend, to, twist, around, the, trunk, as, the, tree, ages, it, sometimes, reminds, one, of, a, large, cable, with, twisted, strands, the, leaves, are, simple, ovate, or, lanceolate, 10, 30, cm, long, and, 4, 10, cm, wide, with, sharply, pointed, widely, spaced, teeth, with, shallow, rounded, sinuates, between, the, flowers, follow, the, leaves, appearing, in, late, spring, or, early, summer, or, into, july, they, are, arranged, in, long, catkins, of, two, kinds, with, both, kinds, being, borne, on, every, tree, some, catkins, are, made, of, only, male, flowers, which, mature, first, each, flower, has, eight, stamens, or, 10, to, 12, for, c, mollissima, the, ripe, pollen, carries, a, heavy, sweet, odor, that, some, people, find, too, sweet, or, unpleasant, other, catkins, have, these, pollen, bearing, flowers, but, also, carry, near, the, twig, from, which, these, spring, small, clusters, of, female, or, fruit, producing, flowers, two, or, three, flowers, together, form, a, four, lobed, prickly, calybium, which, ultimately, grows, completely, together, to, make, the, brown, hull, or, husk, covering, the, fruits, chestnut, flowers, are, not, self, compatible, so, two, trees, are, required, for, pollination, all, castanea, species, readily, hybridize, with, each, other, the, fruit, is, contained, in, a, spiny, very, sharp, cupule, 5, 11, cm, in, diameter, also, called, bur, or, burr, the, burrs, are, often, paired, or, clustered, on, the, branch, and, contain, one, to, seven, nuts, according, to, the, different, species, varieties, and, cultivars, around, the, time, the, fruits, reach, maturity, the, burrs, turn, yellow, brown, and, split, open, in, two, or, four, sections, they, can, remain, on, the, tree, longer, than, they, hold, the, fruit, but, more, often, achieve, complete, opening, and, release, the, fruits, only, after, having, fallen, on, the, ground, opening, is, partly, due, to, soil, humidity, the, chestnut, fruit, has, a, pointed, end, with, a, small, tuft, at, its, tip, called, flame, in, italian, and, at, the, other, end, a, hilum, a, pale, brown, attachment, scar, in, many, varieties, the, fruit, is, flattened, on, one, or, two, sides, it, has, two, skins, the, first, one, is, a, hard, shiny, brown, outer, hull, or, husk, called, the, pericarpus, the, industry, calls, this, the, peel, underneath, the, pericarpus, is, another, thinner, skin, called, the, pellicle, or, episperm, the, pellicle, closely, adheres, to, the, seed, itself, following, the, grooves, usually, present, at, the, surface, of, the, fruit, these, grooves, are, of, variable, sizes, and, depths, according, to, the, species, and, variety, the, fruit, inside, these, shows, a, germ, with, two, cotyledons, connected, to, creamy, white, flesh, throughout, some, varieties, have, consistently, only, one, embryo, per, fruit, nut, or, have, only, one, large, fruit, per, burr, well, rounded, no, flat, face, the, name, of, varieties, with, these, characteristics, may, start, with, marron, for, example, marron, de, lyon, in, france, or, marrone, di, mugello, in, italy, chestnut, fruit, may, not, exhibit, epigeal, dormancy, it, may, germinate, right, upon, falling, to, the, ground, in, the, autumn, with, the, roots, emerging, from, the, seed, right, away, and, the, leaves, and, stem, the, following, spring, the, germ, can, lose, viability, soon, after, ripening, and, under, drying, conditions, the, superior, fruiting, varieties, among, european, chestnuts, have, good, size, sweet, taste, and, easy, to, remove, inner, skins, american, chestnuts, are, usually, very, small, around, 5, g, but, sweet, tasting, with, easy, to, remove, pellicles, some, japanese, varieties, have, very, large, nuts, around, 40, g, with, typically, difficult, to, remove, pellicles, chinese, chestnut, pellicles, are, usually, easy, to, remove, and, their, sizes, vary, greatly, according, to, the, varieties, although, usually, smaller, than, the, japanese, chestnut, the, unrelated, horse, chestnuts, genus, aesculus, are, not, true, chestnuts, but, are, named, for, producing, nuts, of, similar, appearance, that, are, mildly, poisonous, to, humans, true, chestnuts, should, also, not, be, confused, with, water, chestnuts, which, are, tubers, of, an, aquatic, herbaceous, plant, in, the, sedge, family, cyperaceae, other, species, commonly, mistaken, for, chestnut, trees, are, the, chestnut, oak, quercus, prinus, and, the, american, beech, fagus, grandifolia, both, of, which, are, also, in, the, fagaceae, family, brazil, nuts, called, brasil, chestnuts, casta, as, de, brasil, in, spanish, or, chestnuts, from, par, castanha, do, par, in, portuguese, are, also, unrelated, chestnuts, belong, to, the, family, fagaceae, which, also, includes, oaks, and, beeches, the, four, main, species, groups, are, commonly, known, as, american, european, chinese, and, japanese, chestnuts, the, taxonomy, of, the, american, chestnuts, is, not, completely, resolved, particularly, between, the, chinkapins, castanea, ozarkensis, and, castanea, pumila, which, are, sometimes, considered, to, be, the, same, species, genetics, have, indicated, the, california, native, golden, chinkapin, chrysolepis, chrysophylla, is, worthy, of, inclusion, in, a, different, genus, along, with, a, species, from, coastal, china, there, is, also, another, chestnut, castanea, alabamensis, which, may, be, its, own, species, the, name, chestnut, is, derived, from, an, earlier, english, term, chesten, nut, which, descends, from, the, old, french, word, chastain, modern, french, ch, taigne, the, french, word, in, turn, derives, from, latin, castanea, also, the, scientific, name, of, the, tree, which, traces, to, the, ancient, greek, word, sweet, chestnut, a, possible, source, of, the, greek, word, is, the, ancient, town, of, casthanaea, in, magnesia, its, location, is, at, the, modern, village, of, keramidi, the, town, probably, took, its, name, though, from, the, trees, growing, around, it, in, the, mediterranean, climate, zone, chestnut, trees, are, rarer, in, greece, because, the, chalky, soil, is, not, conducive, to, the, tree, s, growth, kastania, is, located, on, one, of, the, relatively, few, sedimentary, or, siliceous, outcrops, they, grow, so, abundantly, there, that, their, presence, would, have, determined, the, place, s, name, still, others, take, the, name, as, coming, from, the, greek, name, of, sardis, glans, sardis, acorn, sardis, being, the, capital, of, lydia, asia, minor, from, where, the, fruit, had, spread, the, name, is, cited, twice, in, the, king, james, version, of, the, bible, in, one, instance, jacob, puts, peeled, twigs, in, the, water, troughs, to, promote, healthy, offspring, of, his, livestock, although, it, may, indicate, another, tree, it, indicates, the, fruit, was, a, local, staple, food, in, the, early, 17th, century, these, synonyms, are, or, have, been, in, use, fagus, castanea, used, by, linnaeus, in, first, edition, of, species, plantarum, 1753, sardian, nut, jupiter, s, nut, husked, nut, and, spanish, chestnut, u, s, the, tree, is, noted, for, attracting, wildlife, the, nuts, are, an, important, food, for, jays, pigeons, wild, boar, deer, and, squirrels, american, and, chinese, chinquapins, c, pumila, and, c, henryi, have, very, small, nuts, that, are, an, important, source, of, food, for, wildlife, it, has, been, a, staple, food, in, southern, europe, turkey, and, southwestern, and, eastern, asia, for, millennia, largely, replacing, cereals, where, these, would, not, grow, well, if, at, all, in, mountainous, mediterranean, areas, evidence, of, its, cultivation, by, humans, is, found, since, around, 2000, bc, alexander, the, great, and, the, romans, planted, chestnut, trees, across, europe, while, on, their, various, campaigns, a, greek, army, is, said, to, have, survived, their, retreat, from, asia, minor, in, 401, 399, bc, thanks, to, their, stores, of, chestnuts, ancient, greeks, such, as, dioscorides, and, galen, wrote, of, chestnuts, to, comment, on, their, medicinal, properties, and, of, the, flatulence, induced, by, eating, too, much, of, it, to, the, early, christians, chestnuts, symbolized, chastity, until, the, introduction, of, the, potato, whole, forest, dwelling, communities, which, had, scarce, access, to, wheat, flour, relied, on, chestnuts, as, their, main, source, of, carbohydrates, in, some, parts, of, italy, a, cake, made, of, chestnuts, is, used, as, a, substitute, for, potatoes, in, 1583, charles, estienne, and, jean, li, bault, wrote, an, infinity, of, people, live, on, nothing, else, but, the, chestnut, in, 1802, an, italian, agronomist, said, of, tuscany, that, the, fruit, of, the, chestnut, tree, is, practically, the, sole, subsistence, of, our, highlanders, while, in, 1879, it, was, said, that, it, almost, exclusively, fed, whole, populations, for, half, the, year, as, a, temporary, but, complete, substitution, for, cereals, in, britain, boundary, records, compiled, in, the, reign, of, king, john, already, showed, the, famous, tortworth, chestnut, in, south, gloucestershire, as, a, landmark, it, was, also, known, by, the, same, name, of, great, chestnut, of, tortworth, in, the, days, of, stephen, this, tree, measured, over, 50, ft, 15, m, in, circumference, at, 5, ft, 1, 5, m, from, the, ground, in, 1720, the, hundred, horse, chestnut, in, the, chestnut, forests, on, mount, etna, is, the, oldest, living, chestnut, tree, and, is, said, to, be, even, larger, chestnut, trees, particularly, flourish, in, the, mediterranean, basin, in, 1584, the, governor, of, genoa, which, dominated, corsica, ordered, all, the, farmers, and, landowners, to, plant, four, trees, yearly, among, which, was, a, chestnut, tree, plus, olive, fig, and, mulberry, trees, many, communities, owe, their, origin, and, former, richness, to, the, ensuing, chestnut, woods, in, france, the, marron, glac, a, candied, chestnut, involving, 16, different, processes, in, a, typically, french, cooking, style, is, always, served, at, christmas, and, new, year, s, time, in, modena, italy, they, are, soaked, in, wine, before, roasting, and, serving, and, are, also, traditionally, eaten, on, saint, simon, s, day, in, tuscany, in, the, romagna, region, roasted, chestnuts, are, often, served, with, a, traditional, wine, the, cagnina, di, romagna, it, is, traditional, to, eat, roasted, chestnuts, in, portugal, on, st, martin, s, day, their, popularity, declined, during, the, last, few, centuries, partly, due, to, their, reputation, of, food, for, poor, people, many, people, did, not, want, to, take, chestnut, bread, as, bread, because, chestnut, flour, does, not, rise, some, slandered, chestnut, products, in, such, words, as, the, bread, which, gives, a, sallow, complexion, written, in, 1770, or, in, 1841, this, kind, of, mortar, which, is, called, a, soup, the, last, decades, worldwide, renewal, may, have, profited, from, the, huge, reforestation, efforts, started, in, the, 1930s, in, the, united, states, to, establish, varieties, of, c, sativa, which, may, be, resistant, to, chestnut, blight, as, well, as, to, relieve, the, strain, on, cereal, supplies, the, main, region, in, italy, for, chestnut, production, is, the, mugello, region, in, 1996, the, european, community, granted, the, fruit, protected, geographic, indication, equivalent, to, the, french, appellation, d, origine, contr, l, e, status, to, the, mugello, sweet, chestnut, it, is, markedly, sweet, peels, easily, is, not, excessively, floury, or, astringent, and, has, notes, of, vanilla, hazelnut, and, more, subtly, fresh, bread, it, has, no, unpleasant, aroma, such, as, yeast, fungus, mold, or, paper, which, sometimes, occur, with, other, chestnuts, the, main, regions, in, france, for, chestnut, production, are, the, d, partements, of, ard, che, with, the, famous, ch, taigne, d, ard, che, a, o, c, archived, 2012, 02, 27, at, the, wayback, machine, of, the, var, eastern, provence, of, the, c, vennes, gard, and, loz, re, d, partements, and, of, the, lyon,

both, success, and, hard, times, mastery, and, strength, the, japanese, chestnut, kuri, was, in, cultivation, before, rice, and, the, chinese, chestnut, c, mollissima, possibly, for, 2, 000, to, 6, 000, years, during, british, colonial, rule, in, the, mid, 1700s, to, 1947, the, sweet, chestnut, c, sativa, was, widely, introduced, in, the, temperate, parts, of, the, indian, subcontinent, mainly, in, the, lower, to, middle, himalayas, they, are, widely, found, in, british, founded, hill, stations, in, northern, india, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, bhutan, and, nepal, they, are, mainly, used, as, an, ornamental, tree, and, are, found, in, almost, all, british, founded, botanical, gardens, and, official, governmental, compounds, such, as, larger, official, residences, in, temperate, parts, of, the, indian, subcontinent, china, has, about, 300, chestnut, cultivars, moreover, the, dandong, chestnut, belonging, to, the, japanese, chestnut, c, crenata, is, a, major, cultivar, in, liaoning, province, in, south, korea, roasted, chestnuts, gunbam, are, a, popular, winter, snack, and, serve, as, a, symbol, of, abundance, in, ancestral, rituals, roasted, chestnuts, are, also, included, in, folk, songs, of, korea, which, include, gunbam, taryeong, a, song, that, celebrates, chestnuts, as, well, as, jeongseokga, a, song, from, the, goryeo, period, gongju, one, of, baekje, s, former, capitals, is, renowned, for, its, chestnuts, with, an, annual, chestnut, festival, that, takes, place, in, the, winter, in, the, samgukji, records, of, the, three, kingdoms, a, book, that, was, compiled, during, the, jin, dynasty, about, the, three, kingdoms, chestnuts, are, used, in, the, description, of, mahan, the, former, land, of, baekje, in, the, philippines, the, endemic, talakatak, or, philippine, chestnut, castanopsis, philippinensis, is, not, cultivated, commercially, though, its, nuts, are, harvested, from, the, wild, and, consumed, locally, imported, chestnuts, known, as, kastanyas, in, tagalog, from, spanish, casta, as, are, traditionally, sold, as, street, food, in, the, philippines, during, the, christmas, season, native, americans, were, eating, the, american, chestnut, species, mainly, c, dentata, and, some, others, long, before, european, immigrants, introduced, their, stock, to, america, and, before, the, arrival, of, chestnut, blight, in, some, places, such, as, the, appalachian, mountains, one, quarter, of, hardwoods, were, chestnuts, mature, trees, often, grew, straight, and, branch, free, for, 50, ft, 15, m, up, to, 100, ft, averaging, up, to, 5, ft, in, diameter, for, three, centuries, most, barns, and, homes, east, of, the, mississippi, river, were, made, from, it, in, 1911, the, food, book, the, grocer, s, encyclopedia, noted, that, a, cannery, in, holland, included, in, its, vegetables, and, meat, ready, cooked, combinations, a, chestnuts, and, sausages, casserole, beside, the, more, classic, beef, and, onions, and, green, peas, and, veal, this, celebrated, the, chestnut, culture, that, would, bring, whole, villages, out, in, the, woods, for, three, weeks, each, autumn, and, keep, them, busy, all, winter, and, deplored, the, lack, of, food, diversity, in, the, united, states, s, shop, shelves, soon, after, that, however, the, american, chestnuts, were, nearly, wiped, out, by, chestnut, blight, the, discovery, of, the, blight, fungus, on, some, asian, chestnut, trees, planted, on, long, island, new, york, was, made, public, in, 1904, within, 40, years, the, nearly, four, billion, strong, american, chestnut, population, in, north, america, was, devastated, only, a, few, clumps, of, trees, remained, in, michigan, wisconsin, california, and, the, pacific, northwest, due, to, disease, american, chestnut, wood, almost, disappeared, from, the, market, for, decades, although, quantities, can, still, be, obtained, as, reclaimed, lumber, today, they, only, survive, as, single, trees, separated, from, any, others, very, rare, and, as, living, stumps, or, stools, with, only, a, few, growing, enough, shoots, to, produce, seeds, shortly, before, dying, this, is, just, enough, to, preserve, the, genetic, material, used, to, engineer, an, american, chestnut, tree, with, the, minimal, necessary, genetic, input, from, any, of, the, disease, immune, asiatic, species, efforts, started, in, the, 1930s, are, still, ongoing, to, repopulate, the, country, with, these, trees, in, massachusetts, and, many, places, elsewhere, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1970s, geneticist, charles, burnham, began, back, breeding, asian, chestnut, into, american, chestnut, populations, to, confer, blight, resistance, with, the, minimum, difference, in, genes, in, the, 1950s, the, dunstan, chestnut, was, developed, in, greensboro, n, c, and, constitutes, the, majority, of, blight, free, chestnuts, produced, in, the, united, states, annually, today, the, demand, for, the, nut, outstrips, supply, the, united, states, imported, 4, 056, metric, tons, of, european, in, shell, chestnuts, worth, 10, million, in, 2007, the, u, s, chestnut, industry, is, in, its, infancy, producing, less, than, 1, of, total, world, production, since, the, mid, 20th, century, most, of, the, us, imports, are, from, southern, italy, with, the, large, meaty, and, richly, flavored, sicilian, chestnuts, being, considered, among, the, best, quality, for, bulk, sale, and, supermarket, retail, some, imports, come, from, portugal, and, france, the, next, two, largest, sources, of, imports, are, china, and, south, korea, the, french, varieties, of, marrons, are, highly, favored, and, sold, at, high, prices, in, gourmet, shops, a, study, of, the, sector, in, 2005, found, that, u, s, producers, are, mainly, part, timers, diversifying, an, existing, agricultural, business, or, hobbyists, another, recent, study, indicates, that, investment, in, a, new, plantation, takes, 13, years, to, break, even, at, least, within, the, current, australian, market, starting, a, small, scale, operation, requires, a, relatively, low, initial, investment, this, is, a, factor, in, the, small, size, of, the, present, production, operations, with, half, of, them, being, between, 3, and, 10, acres, 12, 000, and, 40, 000, m, 2, another, determining, factor, in, the, small, productivity, of, the, sector, is, that, most, orchards, have, been, created, less, than, 10, years, ago, so, have, young, trees, which, are, as, now, barely, entering, commercial, production, assuming, a, 10, kg, 22, lb, yield, for, a, 10, year, old, tree, is, a, reliable, conservative, estimate, though, some, exceptional, specimens, of, that, age, have, yielded, 100, kg, 220, lb, so, most, producers, earn, less, than, 5, 000, per, year, with, a, third, of, them, not, having, sold, anything, so, far, moreover, the, plantings, have, so, far, been, mostly, of, chinese, species, but, the, products, are, not, readily, available, the, american, chestnut, foundation, in, collaboration, with, many, partners, suny, esf, the, american, chestnut, cooperators, foundation, and, many, others, from, education, research, and, industry, sectors, contributing, to, the, program, are, in, the, last, stages, of, developing, a, variety, that, is, as, close, as, possible, to, the, american, chestnut, while, having, incorporated, the, blight, resistant, gene, of, the, asiatic, species, considering, the, additional, advantage, that, chestnut, trees, can, be, easily, grown, organically, and, assuming, the, development, of, brands, in, the, market, and, everything, else, being, equal, home, grown, products, would, reach, higher, prices, than, imports, the, high, volume, of, which, indicates, a, market, with, expanding, prospects, as, of, 2008, the, price, for, chestnuts, sold, fresh, in, the, shell, ranges, from, 1, 50, lb, 3, 30, kg, wholesale, to, about, 5, lb, 11, kg, retail, depending, mainly, on, the, size, the, australian, gold, rush, of, the, 1850s, and, 1860s, led, to, the, first, recorded, plantings, of, european, chestnut, trees, brought, from, europe, by, settlers, along, the, years, most, chestnut, tree, plantations, were, c, sativa, stock, which, is, still, the, dominant, species, some, of, these, remain, today, some, trees, in, northern, victoria, are, around, 120, years, old, and, up, to, 60, m, tall, chestnuts, grow, well, in, southwest, western, australia, which, has, cold, winters, and, warm, to, hot, summers, as, of, 2008, the, country, has, nearly, 350, growers, annually, producing, around, 1, 200, metric, tons, of, chestnuts, of, which, 80, come, from, northeast, victoria, the, produce, is, mostly, sold, to, the, domestic, fresh, fruit, market, chestnuts, are, slowly, gaining, popularity, in, australia, a, considerable, increase, in, production, is, expected, in, the, next, 10, years, due, to, the, increase, in, commercial, plantings, during, the, last, 15, to, 25, years, by, far, the, most, common, species, in, australia, is, the, european, chestnut, but, small, numbers, of, the, other, species, as, well, as, some, hybrids, have, been, planted, the, japanese, chestnut, c, crenata, does, well, in, wet, and, humid, weather, and, in, hot, summers, about, 30, c, and, was, introduced, to, new, zealand, in, the, early, 1900s, more, so, in, the, upper, north, island, region, chestnuts, produce, a, better, crop, when, subjected, to, chill, temperatures, during, the, dormant, period, frosts, and, snowfalls, are, beneficial, rather, than, harmful, to, the, trees, the, dormant, plant, is, very, cold, hardy, in, britain, to, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, h6, hardiness, rating, to, 20, c, chestnut, is, hardy, to, usda, zone, 5, which, is, 29, c, 20, f, lower, in, average, minimal, temperature, than, london, in, zone, 9, the, young, growth, in, spring, even, on, mature, plants, however, is, frost, tender, bud, burst, is, later, than, most, other, fruit, trees, so, late, frosts, can, be, damaging, to, young, buds, trees, can, be, found, at, altitudes, between, 200, and, 1000, m, above, sea, level, some, mention, between, 300, and, 750, m, altitude, while, the, famous, hundred, horse, chestnut, on, mount, etna, stands, at, 1200, metres, they, can, tolerate, maritime, exposure, although, growth, is, reduced, seeds, germinate, in, late, winter, or, early, spring, but, the, life, length, is, short, if, kept, moist, they, can, be, stored, in, a, cool, place, for, a, few, months, but, must, be, checked, regularly, for, signs, of, germination, low, temperature, prolongs, dormancy, sowing, them, as, soon, as, ripe, is, better, either, in, cold, frames, or, seedbeds, outdoors, where, they, can, be, left, in, situ, for, one, to, two, years, before, being, planted, in, their, permanent, positions, or, in, pots, where, the, plants, can, be, put, out, into, their, permanent, positions, in, summer, or, autumn, they, must, be, protected, from, the, cold, in, their, first, winter, and, also, from, mice, and, squirrels, chestnuts, are, considered, self, sterile, so, at, least, two, trees, are, needed, for, pollination, castanea, grows, best, in, a, soil, with, good, drainage, and, adequate, moisture, the, tree, prefers, sloping, deep, soils, it, does, not, like, shallow, or, heavy, soils, with, impermeable, clay, subsoils, the, chinese, chestnut, prefers, a, fertile, well, drained, soil, but, it, grows, well, in, fairly, dry, rocky, or, poor, soils, although, castanea, can, grow, in, very, acidic, soil, and, while, these, soils, are, reasonably, well, tolerated, the, preferred, range, is, from, ph, 5, 5, 6, 0, it, does, not, grow, well, on, alkaline, soils, such, as, chalk, but, thrives, on, soils, such, as, those, derived, from, granite, sandstone, or, schist, on, alkaline, soils, chestnut, trees, can, be, grown, by, grafting, them, onto, oak, rootstocks, recently, cleared, land, is, best, avoided, to, help, resist, the, root, rot, armillaria, mellia, castanea, likes, a, full, sun, position, an, experiment, with, c, dentata, seedlings, in, ohio, confirmed, the, need, for, sun, for, optimal, growth, the, butt, of, the, tree, is, sometimes, painted, with, white, paint, to, protect, the, tree, from, sunburn, until, it, has, developed, enough, canopy, wide, spacing, between, the, trees, encourages, low, broad, crowns, with, maximum, exposure, to, sunshine, to, increase, fruit, production, where, chestnut, trees, touch, virtually, no, fruit, is, produced, current, industrial, planting, spacings, can, range, from, 7, x, 7, to, 20, x, 20, m, the, closer, plantings, which, are, more, popular, mean, quicker, increases, in, short, term, production, but, heavy, pruning, or, even, tree, removal, is, required, later, the, optimum, rainfall, for, chestnut, trees, is, 800, mm, 31, in, or, more, ideally, in, even, distribution, throughout, the, year, mulching, during, summer, is, recommended, rainfall, below, 700, mm, 28, in, per, year, needs, be, complemented, with, for, example, a, drip, irrigation, system, this, should, water, the, soil, at, the, outer, half, of, the, circle, formed, by, the, drip, line, to, encourage, root, growth, independently, from, annual, rainfall, watering, young, trees, is, recommended, at, least, during, summer, and, early, autumn, once, established, they, resist, droughts, well, in, addition, to, being, consumed, fresh, chestnuts, can, also, be, canned, pureed, or, preserved, in, sugar, or, syrup, marrons, glac, s, shelled, and, cooked, nuts, should, be, covered, refrigerated, and, used, within, 3, 4, days, cooked, chestnuts, either, whole, chopped, or, pureed, may, be, frozen, in, an, airtight, container, and, held, up, to, 9, months, because, of, their, high, water, content, transpiration, rates, and, consequent, loss, weight, the, nuts, react, as, fresh, fruits, not, as, nuts, they, should, be, kept, cool, at, all, times, including, in, shops, when, on, display, for, sale, to, preserve, their, freshness, for, a, few, months, with, no, artificial, refrigeration, the, chestnuts, can, be, soaked, in, cold, water, for, about, 20, hours, immediately, after, harvest, after, which, they, are, dried, in, the, shade, then, layered, in, dry, sand, chestnuts, behave, similarly, to, seeds, in, that, they, produce, very, little, ethylene, and, their, respiration, rate, is, low, varying, between, 5, and, 20, mg, kg, h, depending, on, the, temperature, most, chestnut, wood, production, is, done, by, coppice, systems, cut, on, a, 12, year, rotation, to, provide, small, timber, which, does, not, split, as, badly, as, large, logs, in, southern, england, particularly, in, kent, sweet, chestnut, has, traditionally, been, grown, as, coppices, being, recut, every, 10, years, or, so, on, rotation, for, poles, used, for, firewood, and, fencing, fence, posts, and, chestnut, paling, an, excellent, soil, enriching, understory, in, pine, forests, sustainable, forest, management, incorporates, more, mixed, plantings, of, proven, efficiency, as, opposed, to, monosylviculture, a, study, presented, in, 1997, has, evaluated, positively, the, potential, increase, in, productivity, with, mixed, stands, and, plantations, compared, to, plots, of, only, one, species, the, relative, yield, total, values, of, the, mixed, plantings, steadily, increase, with, time, c, sativa, responds, well, to, competitive, pressure, from, pseudotsuga, menziesii, the, latter, also, showing, a, higher, productivity, c, dentata, seedlings, in, ohio, reforestation, efforts, are, best, achieved, by, planting, them, in, places, with, little, or, no, arboreous, land, cover, because, of, the, need, for, light, in, 2020, world, production, of, cultivated, chestnuts, was, 2, 322, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 75, of, the, total, table, chestnuts, depart, from, the, norm, for, culinary, nuts, as, they, have, little, protein, or, fat, their, calories, come, chiefly, from, carbohydrates, fresh, chestnut, fruits, provide, about, 820, kj, 200, kcal, of, food, energy, per, 100, g, of, edible, parts, which, is, much, lower, than, walnuts, almonds, other, nuts, and, dried, fruit, about, 2, 500, kj, or, 600, kcal, per, 100, g, in, some, areas, sweet, chestnut, trees, are, called, bread, trees, when, chestnuts, are, just, starting, to, ripen, the, fruits, are, mostly, starch, and, are, firm, under, finger, pressure, from, the, high, water, content, as, the, chestnuts, ripen, the, starch, is, slowly, converted, into, sugars, and, moisture, content, decreases, upon, pressing, the, ripe, chestnut, a, slight, give, can, be, felt, the, hull, is, not, so, tense, and, space, occurs, between, the, flesh, of, the, fruit, and, it, raw, chestnuts, are, 60, water, and, contain, 44, grams, of, carbohydrates, 2, grams, of, protein, one, gram, of, fat, supplying, 200, calories, in, a, 100, gram, reference, amount, table, chestnuts, provide, some, b, vitamins, and, dietary, minerals, in, significant, content, table, their, carbohydrate, content, compares, with, that, of, wheat, and, rice, chestnuts, have, twice, as, much, starch, as, the, potato, on, an, as, is, basis, they, contain, about, 8, of, various, sugars, mainly, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and, in, lesser, amounts, stachyose, and, raffinose, which, are, fermented, in, the, lower, gut, producing, gas, chestnuts, are, among, the, few, nuts, that, contain, vitamin, c, with, 48, of, the, daily, value, in, a, 100, gram, serving, table, the, amount, of, vitamin, c, decreases, by, roughly, 40, upon, heating, typically, the, vitamin, is, decreased, or, destroyed, in, heated, foods, fresh, chestnuts, contain, about, 52, water, by, weight, which, evaporates, relatively, quickly, during, storage, they, can, lose, as, much, as, 1, of, weight, in, one, day, at, 20, c, 68, f, and, 70, relative, humidity, the, fruit, can, be, peeled, and, eaten, raw, but, it, can, be, somewhat, astringent, especially, if, the, pellicle, is, not, removed, another, method, of, eating, the, fruit, involves, roasting, which, does, not, require, peeling, roasting, requires, scoring, the, fruit, beforehand, to, prevent, explosion, of, the, fruit, due, to, expansion, once, cooked, its, texture, is, slightly, similar, to, that, of, a, baked, potato, with, a, delicate, sweet, and, nutty, flavour, this, method, of, preparation, is, popular, in, many, countries, where, the, scored, chestnuts, may, be, cooked, mixed, with, a, little, sugar, chestnuts, can, be, dried, and, milled, into, flour, which, can, then, be, used, to, prepare, breads, cakes, pies, pancakes, pastas, polenta, known, in, corsica, as, pulenda, or, used, as, thickener, for, stews, soups, and, sauces, chestnut, cake, may, be, prepared, using, chestnut, flour, in, corsica, the, flour, is, fried, into, doughnut, like, fritters, called, fritelli, and, made, into, necci, pattoni, castagnacci, and, cialdi, the, flour, can, be, light, beige, like, that, from, castagniccia, or, darker, in, other, regions, it, is, a, good, solution, for, long, storage, of, a, nutritious, food, chestnut, bread, can, stay, fresh, as, long, as, two, weeks, the, nuts, can, also, be, eaten, candied, boiled, steamed, deep, fried, grilled, or, roasted, in, sweet, or, savory, recipes, they, can, be, used, to, stuff, vegetables, poultry, fowl, and, other, edibles, they, are, available, fresh, dried, ground, or, canned, whole, or, in, puree, candied, chestnuts, whole, chestnuts, candied, in, sugar, syrup, then, iced, are, sold, under, the, french, name, marrons, glac, s, or, turkish, name, kestane, ekeri, sugared, chestnuts, they, appeared, in, france, in, the, sixteenth, century, toward, the, end, of, nineteenth, century, lyon, went, into, a, recession, with, the, collapse, of, the, textile, market, notably, silk, cl, ment, faugier, a, civil, engineer, was, looking, for, a, way, to, revitalize, the, regional, economy, in, 1882, at, privas, he, invented, the, technology, to, make, marrons, glac, s, on, an, industrial, scale, although, a, great, number, of, the, more, than, 20, necessary, steps, from, harvest, to, the, finished, product, are, still, accomplished, manually, chestnuts, are, picked, in, autumn, and, candied, from, the, start, of, the, following, summer, for, the, ensuing, christmas, thus, the, marrons, glac, s, eaten, at, christmas, are, those, picked, the, year, before, in, spain, on, 31, october, on, the, eve, of, the, all, saints, day, catalonia, celebrates, la, castanyada, a, festivity, that, consists, of, eating, chestnuts, panellets, sweet, potatoes, and, muscatell, on, november, in, the, regions, of, galicia, asturias, cantabria, and, other, northern, provinces, and, portugal, the, magosto, is, celebrated, in, hungarian, cuisine, cooked, chestnuts, are, pur, ed, mixed, with, sugar, and, usually, rum, forced, through, a, ricer, and, topped, with, whipped, cream, to, make, a, dessert, called, gesztenyep, r, chestnut, pur, e, in, swiss, cuisine, a, similar, dish, made, with, kirsch, and, butter, is, called, vermicelles, a, french, version, is, known, as, mont, blanc, a, fine, granular, sugar, can, be, obtained, from, the, fermentation, of, the, juice, as, well, as, a, beer, the, roasted, fruit, provides, a, coffee, substitute, parmentier, who, among, other, things, was, a, famous, potato, promoter, extracted, sugar, from, chestnuts, and, sent, a, chestnut, sugarloaf, weighing, several, pounds, to, the, academy, of, lyon, the, continental, blockade, following, shortly, after, 1806, 1814, increased, the, research, into, developing, chestnuts, as, a, source, of, sugar, but, napoleon, chose, beets, instead, sweet, chestnuts, are, not, easy, to, peel, when, cold, one, kilogram, of, untainted, chestnuts, yields, about, 700, g, of, shelled, chestnuts, chestnuts, are, often, added, to, animal, fodder, a, first, soak, in, limewater, removes, their, bitter, flavour, then, they, are, ground, and, mixed, with, the, ordinary, provender, other, methods, of, preparation, are, also, used, it, is, given, to, horses, and, cattle, in, the, orient, and, to, pigs, in, england, france, and, other, places, the, leaves, are, not, as, prone, to, be, insect, eaten, as, those, of, the, oak, and, are, also, used, for, fodder, chestnut, is, of, the, same, family, as, oak, and, likewise, its, wood, contains, many, tannins, this, renders, the, wood, very, durable, gives, it, excellent, natural, outdoor, resistance, and, saves, the, need, for, other, protection, treatment, it, also, corrodes, iron, slowly, although, copper, brass, or, stainless, metals, are, not, affected, chestnut, timber, is, decorative, light, brown, in, color, it, is, sometimes, confused, with, oak, wood, the, two, woods, textures, are, similar, when, in, a, growing, stage, with, very, little, sap, wood, a, chestnut, tree, contains, more, timber, of, a, durable, quality, than, an, oak, of, the, same, dimensions, young, chestnut, wood, has, proved, more, durable, than, oak, for, woodwork, that, has, to, be, partly, in, the, ground, such, as, stakes, and, fences, after, most, growth, is, achieved, older, chestnut, timber, tends, to, split, and, warp, when, harvested, the, timber, becomes, neither, so, hard, nor, so, strong, as, oak, the, american, chestnut, c, dentata, served, as, an, important, source, of, lumber, because, it, has, long, unbranched, trunks, in, britain, chestnut, was, formerly, used, indiscriminately, with, oak, for, the, construction, of, houses, millwork, and, household, furniture, it, grows, so, freely, in, britain, that, it, was, long, considered, a, truly, native, species, partly, because, the, roof, of, westminster, hall, and, the, parliament, house, of, edinburgh, were, mistakenly, thought, to, be, constructed, of, chestnut, wood, chestnut, wood, however, loses, much, of, its, durability, when, the, tree, is, more, than, 50, years, old, and, despite, the, local, chestnut, s, quick, growth, rate, the, timber, used, for, these, two, buildings, is, considerably, larger, than, a, 50, year, old, chestnut, s, girth, it, has, been, proven, that, the, roofs, of, these, buildings, are, made, of, durmast, oak, which, closely, resembles, chestnut, in, grain, and, color, it, is, therefore, uncommon, to, find, large, pieces, of, chestnut, in, building, structures, but, it, has, always, been, highly, valued, for, small, outdoor, furniture, pieces, fencing, cladding, shingles, for, covering, buildings, and, pit, props, for, which, durability, is, an, important, factor, in, italy, chestnut, is, also, used, to, make, barrels, used, for, aging, balsamic, vinegar, and, some, alcoholic, beverages, such, as, whisky, or, lambic, beer, of, note, the, famous, 18th, century, berles, in, the, french, c, vennes, are, cupboards, cut, directly, from, the, hollowed, trunk, dry, chestnut, firewood, is, best, burned, in, a, closed, log, burner, because, of, its, tendency, to, spit, when, on, an, open, fire, chestnut, wood, is, a, useful, source, of, natural, tannin, and, was, used, for, tanning, leather, before, the, introduction, of, synthetic, tannins, on, a, 10, moisture, basis, the, bark, contains, 6, 8, tannin, and, the, wood, 13, 4, the, bark, imparts, a, dark, color, to, the, tannin, and, has, a, higher, sugar, content, which, increases, the, percentage, of, soluble, non, tans, or, impurities, in, the, extract, so, it, was, not, employed, in, this, use, chestnut, tannin, is, obtained, by, hot, water, extraction, of, chipped, wood, it, is, an, ellagic, tannin, and, its, main, constituents, are, identified, by, castalagin, 14, 2, and, vescalagin, 16, 2, it, has, a, naturally, low, ph, value, relatively, low, salts, content, and, high, acids, content, this, determines, its, astringency, and, its, capability, to, fix, raw, hides, these, properties, make, chestnut, extract, especially, suitable, for, the, tanning, of, heavy, hides, and, to, produce, leather, soles, for, high, quality, shoes, in, particular, it, is, possible, to, obtain, a, leather, with, high, yield, in, weight, which, is, compact, firm, flexible, and, waterproof, chestnut, tanned, leathers, are, elastic, lightfast, resistant, to, traction, and, abrasion, and, have, warm, color, chestnut, tannin, is, one, of, the, pyrogallol, class, of, tannins, also, known, as, hydrolysable, tannin, as, it, tends, to, give, a, brownish, tone, to, the, leather, it, is, most, often, used, in, combination, with, quebracho, mimosa, tara, myrabolans, and, valonia, the, wood, seems, to, reach, its, highest, tannin, content, after, the, trees, reach, 30, years, old, the, southern, european, chestnut, wood, usually, contains, at, least, 10, to, 13, more, tannin, than, chestnut, trees, in, northern, climates, fabric, can, be, starched, with, chestnut, meal, linen, cloth, can, be, whitened, with, chestnut, meal, the, leaves, and, the, skins, husk, and, pellicle, of, the, fruits, provide, a, hair, shampoo, hydrolysable, chestnut, tannins, can, be, used, for, partial, phenol, substitution, in, phenolic, resin, adhesives, production, and, also, for, direct, use, as, resin, chestnut, buds, have, been, listed, as, one, of, the, 38, substances, used, to, prepare, bach, flower, remedies, a, kind, of, alternative, medicine, promoted, for, its, effect, on, health, however, according, to, cancer, research, uk, there, is, no, scientific, evidence, to, prove, that, flower, remedies, can, control, cure, or, prevent, any, type, of, disease, including, cancer
