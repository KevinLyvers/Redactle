krill, euphausiids, sg, krill, are, small, and, exclusively, marine, crustaceans, of, the, order, euphausiacea, found, in, all, the, world, s, oceans, the, name, krill, comes, from, the, norwegian, word, krill, meaning, small, fry, of, fish, which, is, also, often, attributed, to, species, of, fish, krill, are, considered, an, important, trophic, level, connection, near, the, bottom, of, the, food, chain, they, feed, on, phytoplankton, and, to, a, lesser, extent, zooplankton, and, are, also, the, main, source, of, food, for, many, larger, animals, in, the, southern, ocean, one, species, the, antarctic, krill, makes, up, an, estimated, biomass, of, around, 379, million, tonnes, making, it, among, the, species, with, the, largest, total, biomass, over, half, of, this, biomass, is, eaten, by, whales, seals, penguins, seabirds, squid, and, fish, each, year, most, krill, species, display, large, daily, vertical, migrations, thus, providing, food, for, predators, near, the, surface, at, night, and, in, deeper, waters, during, the, day, krill, are, fished, commercially, in, the, southern, ocean, and, in, the, waters, around, japan, the, total, global, harvest, amounts, to, 150, 000, 200, 000, tonnes, annually, most, of, this, from, the, scotia, sea, most, of, the, krill, catch, is, used, for, aquaculture, and, aquarium, feeds, as, bait, in, sport, fishing, or, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, in, japan, the, philippines, and, russia, krill, are, also, used, for, human, consumption, and, are, known, as, okiami, in, japan, they, are, eaten, as, camarones, in, spain, and, philippines, in, the, philippines, krill, are, also, known, as, alamang, and, are, used, to, make, a, salty, paste, called, bagoong, krill, are, also, the, main, prey, of, baleen, whales, including, the, blue, whale, krill, belong, to, the, large, arthropod, subphylum, the, crustacea, the, most, familiar, and, largest, group, of, crustaceans, the, class, malacostraca, includes, the, superorder, eucarida, comprising, the, three, orders, euphausiacea, krill, decapoda, shrimp, prawns, lobsters, crabs, and, the, planktonic, amphionidacea, the, order, euphausiacea, comprises, two, families, the, more, abundant, euphausiidae, contains, 10, different, genera, with, a, total, of, 85, species, of, these, the, genus, euphausia, is, the, largest, with, 31, species, the, lesser, known, family, the, bentheuphausiidae, has, only, one, species, bentheuphausia, amblyops, a, bathypelagic, krill, living, in, deep, waters, below, 1, 000, m, 3, 300, ft, it, is, considered, the, most, primitive, extant, krill, species, well, known, species, of, the, euphausiidae, of, commercial, krill, fisheries, include, antarctic, krill, euphausia, superba, pacific, krill, e, pacifica, and, northern, krill, meganyctiphanes, norvegica, bentheuphausia, thysanopoda, nematobrachion, meganyctiphanes, pseudeuphausia, euphausia, nyctiphanes, nematoscelis, thysanoessa, tessarabrachion, stylocheiron, as, of, 2013, the, order, euphausiacea, is, believed, to, be, monophyletic, due, to, several, unique, conserved, morphological, characteristics, autapomorphy, such, as, its, naked, filamentous, gills, and, thin, thoracopods, and, by, molecular, studies, there, have, been, many, theories, of, the, location, of, the, order, euphausiacea, since, the, first, description, of, thysanopode, tricuspide, by, henri, milne, edwards, in, 1830, the, similarity, of, their, biramous, thoracopods, had, led, zoologists, to, group, euphausiids, and, mysidacea, in, the, order, schizopoda, which, was, split, by, johan, erik, vesti, boas, in, 1883, into, two, separate, orders, later, william, thomas, calman, 1904, ranked, the, mysidacea, in, the, superorder, peracarida, and, euphausiids, in, the, superorder, eucarida, although, even, up, to, the, 1930s, the, order, schizopoda, was, advocated, it, was, later, also, proposed, that, order, euphausiacea, should, be, grouped, with, the, penaeidae, family, of, prawns, in, the, decapoda, based, on, developmental, similarities, as, noted, by, robert, gurney, and, isabella, gordon, the, reason, for, this, debate, is, that, krill, share, some, morphological, features, of, decapods, and, others, of, mysids, molecular, studies, have, not, unambiguously, grouped, them, possibly, due, to, the, paucity, of, key, rare, species, such, as, bentheuphausia, amblyops, in, krill, and, amphionides, reynaudii, in, eucarida, one, study, supports, the, monophyly, of, eucarida, with, basal, mysida, another, groups, euphausiacea, with, mysida, the, schizopoda, while, yet, another, groups, euphausiacea, with, hoplocarida, no, extant, fossil, can, be, unequivocally, assigned, to, euphausiacea, some, extinct, eumalacostracan, taxa, have, been, thought, to, be, euphausiaceans, such, as, anthracophausia, crangopsis, now, assigned, to, the, aeschronectida, hoplocarida, and, palaeomysis, all, dating, of, speciation, events, were, estimated, by, molecular, clock, methods, which, placed, the, last, common, ancestor, of, the, krill, family, euphausiidae, order, euphausiacea, minus, bentheuphausia, amblyops, to, have, lived, in, the, lower, cretaceous, about, 130, million, years, ago, krill, occur, worldwide, in, all, oceans, although, many, individual, species, have, endemic, or, neritic, i, e, coastal, distributions, bentheuphausia, amblyops, a, bathypelagic, species, has, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, within, its, deep, sea, habitat, species, of, the, genus, thysanoessa, occur, in, both, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, the, pacific, is, home, to, euphausia, pacifica, northern, krill, occur, across, the, atlantic, from, the, mediterranean, sea, northward, species, with, neritic, distributions, include, the, four, species, of, the, genus, nyctiphanes, they, are, highly, abundant, along, the, upwelling, regions, of, the, california, humboldt, benguela, and, canarias, current, systems, another, species, having, only, neritic, distribution, is, e, crystallorophias, which, is, endemic, to, the, antarctic, coastline, species, with, endemic, distributions, include, nyctiphanes, capensis, which, occurs, only, in, the, benguela, current, e, mucronata, in, the, humboldt, current, and, the, six, euphausia, species, native, to, the, southern, ocean, in, the, antarctic, seven, species, are, known, one, in, genus, thysanoessa, t, macrura, and, six, in, euphausia, the, antarctic, krill, euphausia, superba, commonly, lives, at, depths, reaching, 100, m, 330, ft, whereas, ice, krill, euphausia, crystallorophias, reach, depth, of, 4, 000, m, 13, 100, ft, though, they, commonly, inhabit, depths, of, at, most, 300, 600, m, 1, 000, 2, 000, ft, krill, perform, diel, vertical, migrations, dvm, in, large, swarms, and, acoustic, data, has, shown, these, migrations, to, go, up, to, 400, metres, in, depth, both, are, found, at, latitudes, south, of, 55, s, with, e, crystallorophias, dominating, south, of, 74, s, and, in, regions, of, pack, ice, other, species, known, in, the, southern, ocean, are, e, frigida, e, longirostris, e, triacantha, and, e, vallentini, krill, are, crustaceans, and, as, do, all, crustaceans, they, have, a, chitinous, exoskeleton, they, have, anatomy, similar, to, a, standard, decapod, with, their, bodies, made, up, of, three, parts, the, cephalothorax, is, composed, of, the, head, and, the, thorax, which, are, fused, and, the, abdomen, which, bears, the, ten, swimming, appendages, and, the, tail, fan, this, outer, shell, of, krill, is, transparent, in, most, species, krill, feature, intricate, compound, eyes, some, species, adapt, to, different, lighting, conditions, through, the, use, of, screening, pigments, they, have, two, antennae, and, several, pairs, of, thoracic, legs, called, pereiopods, or, thoracopods, so, named, because, they, are, attached, to, the, thorax, their, number, varies, among, genera, and, species, these, thoracic, legs, include, feeding, legs, and, grooming, legs, krill, are, probably, the, sister, clade, of, decapods, because, all, species, have, five, pairs, of, swimming, legs, called, swimmerets, in, common, with, the, latter, very, similar, to, those, of, a, lobster, or, freshwater, crayfish, in, spite, of, having, ten, swimmerets, otherwise, known, as, pleopods, krill, cannot, be, considered, decapods, they, lack, any, true, ground, based, legs, due, to, all, their, pereiopods, having, been, converted, into, grooming, and, auxiliary, feeding, legs, in, decapoda, there, are, ten, functioning, pereiopods, giving, them, their, name, whereas, here, there, are, no, remaining, locomotive, pereiopods, nor, are, there, consistently, ten, pereiopods, at, all, most, krill, are, about, 1, 2, centimetres, 0, 4, 0, 8, in, long, as, adults, a, few, species, grow, to, sizes, on, the, order, of, 6, 15, centimetres, 2, 4, 5, 9, in, the, largest, krill, species, thysanopoda, spinicaudata, lives, deep, in, the, open, ocean, krill, can, be, easily, distinguished, from, other, crustaceans, such, as, true, shrimp, by, their, externally, visible, gills, except, for, bentheuphausia, amblyops, krill, are, bioluminescent, animals, having, organs, called, photophores, that, can, emit, light, the, light, is, generated, by, an, enzyme, catalysed, chemiluminescence, reaction, wherein, a, luciferin, a, kind, of, pigment, is, activated, by, a, luciferase, enzyme, studies, indicate, that, the, luciferin, of, many, krill, species, is, a, fluorescent, tetrapyrrole, similar, but, not, identical, to, dinoflagellate, luciferin, and, that, the, krill, probably, do, not, produce, this, substance, themselves, but, acquire, it, as, part, of, their, diet, which, contains, dinoflagellates, krill, photophores, are, complex, organs, with, lenses, and, focusing, abilities, and, can, be, rotated, by, muscles, the, precise, function, of, these, organs, is, as, yet, unknown, possibilities, include, mating, social, interaction, or, orientation, and, as, a, form, of, counter, illumination, camouflage, to, compensate, their, shadow, against, overhead, ambient, light, many, krill, are, filter, feeders, their, frontmost, appendages, the, thoracopods, form, very, fine, combs, with, which, they, can, filter, out, their, food, from, the, water, these, filters, can, be, very, fine, in, species, such, as, euphausia, spp, that, feed, primarily, on, phytoplankton, in, particular, on, diatoms, which, are, unicellular, algae, krill, are, mostly, omnivorous, although, a, few, species, are, carnivorous, preying, on, small, zooplankton, and, fish, larvae, krill, are, an, important, element, of, the, aquatic, food, chain, krill, convert, the, primary, production, of, their, prey, into, a, form, suitable, for, consumption, by, larger, animals, that, cannot, feed, directly, on, the, minuscule, algae, northern, krill, and, some, other, species, have, a, relatively, small, filtering, basket, and, actively, hunt, copepods, and, larger, zooplankton, many, animals, feed, on, krill, ranging, from, smaller, animals, like, fish, or, penguins, to, larger, ones, like, seals, and, baleen, whales, disturbances, of, an, ecosystem, resulting, in, a, decline, in, the, krill, population, can, have, far, reaching, effects, during, a, coccolithophore, bloom, in, the, bering, sea, in, 1998, for, instance, the, diatom, concentration, dropped, in, the, affected, area, krill, cannot, feed, on, the, smaller, coccolithophores, and, consequently, the, krill, population, mainly, e, pacifica, in, that, region, declined, sharply, this, in, turn, affected, other, species, the, shearwater, population, dropped, the, incident, was, thought, to, have, been, one, reason, salmon, did, not, spawn, that, season, several, single, celled, endoparasitoidic, ciliates, of, the, genus, collinia, can, infect, species, of, krill, and, devastate, affected, populations, such, diseases, were, reported, for, thysanoessa, inermis, in, the, bering, sea, and, also, for, e, pacifica, thysanoessa, spinifera, and, t, gregaria, off, the, north, american, pacific, coast, some, ectoparasites, of, the, family, dajidae, epicaridean, isopods, afflict, krill, and, also, shrimp, and, mysids, one, such, parasite, is, oculophryxus, bicaulis, which, was, found, on, the, krill, stylocheiron, affine, and, s, longicorne, it, attaches, itself, to, the, animal, s, eyestalk, and, sucks, blood, from, its, head, it, apparently, inhibits, the, host, s, reproduction, as, none, of, the, afflicted, animals, reached, maturity, climate, change, poses, another, threat, to, krill, populations, preliminary, research, indicates, krill, can, digest, microplastics, under, 5, mm, 0, 20, in, in, diameter, breaking, them, down, and, excreting, them, back, into, the, environment, in, smaller, form, the, life, cycle, of, krill, is, relatively, well, understood, despite, minor, variations, in, detail, from, species, to, species, after, krill, hatch, they, experience, several, larval, stages, nauplius, pseudometanauplius, metanauplius, calyptopsis, and, furcilia, each, of, which, divides, into, sub, stages, the, pseudometanauplius, stage, is, exclusive, to, species, that, lay, their, eggs, within, an, ovigerous, sac, so, called, sac, spawners, the, larvae, grow, and, moult, repeatedly, as, they, develop, replacing, their, rigid, exoskeleton, when, it, becomes, too, small, smaller, animals, moult, more, frequently, than, larger, ones, yolk, reserves, within, their, body, nourish, the, larvae, through, metanauplius, stage, by, the, calyptopsis, stages, differentiation, has, progressed, far, enough, for, them, to, develop, a, mouth, and, a, digestive, tract, and, they, begin, to, eat, phytoplankton, by, that, time, their, yolk, reserves, are, exhausted, and, the, larvae, must, have, reached, the, photic, zone, the, upper, layers, of, the, ocean, where, algae, flourish, during, the, furcilia, stages, segments, with, pairs, of, swimmerets, are, added, beginning, at, the, frontmost, segments, each, new, pair, becomes, functional, only, at, the, next, moult, the, number, of, segments, added, during, any, one, of, the, furcilia, stages, may, vary, even, within, one, species, depending, on, environmental, conditions, after, the, final, furcilia, stage, an, immature, juvenile, emerges, in, a, shape, similar, to, an, adult, and, subsequently, develops, gonads, and, matures, sexually, during, the, mating, season, which, varies, by, species, and, climate, the, male, deposits, a, sperm, sack, at, the, female, s, genital, opening, named, thelycum, the, females, can, carry, several, thousand, eggs, in, their, ovary, which, may, then, account, for, as, much, as, one, third, of, the, animal, s, body, mass, krill, can, have, multiple, broods, in, one, season, with, interbrood, intervals, lasting, on, the, order, of, days, krill, employ, two, types, of, spawning, mechanism, the, 57, species, of, the, genera, bentheuphausia, euphausia, meganyctiphanes, thysanoessa, and, thysanopoda, are, broadcast, spawners, the, female, releases, the, fertilised, eggs, into, the, water, where, they, usually, sink, disperse, and, are, on, their, own, these, species, generally, hatch, in, the, nauplius, 1, stage, but, have, recently, been, discovered, to, hatch, sometimes, as, metanauplius, or, even, as, calyptopis, stages, the, remaining, 29, species, of, the, other, genera, are, sac, spawners, where, the, female, carries, the, eggs, with, her, attached, to, the, rearmost, pairs, of, thoracopods, until, they, hatch, as, metanauplii, although, some, species, like, nematoscelis, difficilis, may, hatch, as, nauplius, or, pseudometanauplius, moulting, occurs, whenever, a, specimen, outgrows, its, rigid, exoskeleton, young, animals, growing, faster, moult, more, often, than, older, and, larger, ones, the, frequency, of, moulting, varies, widely, by, species, and, is, even, within, one, species, subject, to, many, external, factors, such, as, latitude, water, temperature, and, food, availability, the, subtropical, species, nyctiphanes, simplex, for, instance, has, an, overall, inter, moult, period, of, two, to, seven, days, larvae, moult, on, the, average, every, four, days, while, juveniles, and, adults, do, so, on, average, every, six, days, for, e, superba, in, the, antarctic, sea, inter, moult, periods, ranging, between, 9, and, 28, days, depending, on, the, temperature, between, 1, and, 4, c, 30, and, 39, f, have, been, observed, and, for, meganyctiphanes, norvegica, in, the, north, sea, the, inter, moult, periods, range, also, from, 9, and, 28, days, but, at, temperatures, between, 2, 5, and, 15, c, 36, 5, and, 59, 0, f, e, superba, is, able, to, reduce, its, body, size, when, there, is, not, enough, food, available, moulting, also, when, its, exoskeleton, becomes, too, large, similar, shrinkage, has, also, been, observed, for, e, pacifica, a, species, occurring, in, the, pacific, ocean, from, polar, to, temperate, zones, as, an, adaptation, to, abnormally, high, water, temperatures, shrinkage, has, been, postulated, for, other, temperate, zone, species, of, krill, as, well, some, high, latitude, species, of, krill, can, live, for, more, than, six, years, e, g, euphausia, superba, others, such, as, the, mid, latitude, species, euphausia, pacifica, live, for, only, two, years, subtropical, or, tropical, species, longevity, is, still, shorter, e, g, nyctiphanes, simplex, which, usually, lives, for, only, six, to, eight, months, most, krill, are, swarming, animals, the, sizes, and, densities, of, such, swarms, vary, by, species, and, region, for, euphausia, superba, swarms, reach, 10, 000, to, 60, 000, individuals, per, cubic, metre, swarming, is, a, defensive, mechanism, confusing, smaller, predators, that, would, like, to, pick, out, individuals, in, 2012, gandomi, and, alavi, presented, what, appears, to, be, a, successful, stochastic, algorithm, for, modelling, the, behaviour, of, krill, swarms, the, algorithm, is, based, on, three, main, factors, i, movement, induced, by, the, presence, of, other, individuals, ii, foraging, activity, and, iii, random, diffusion, krill, typically, follow, a, diurnal, vertical, migration, it, has, been, assumed, that, they, spend, the, day, at, greater, depths, and, rise, during, the, night, toward, the, surface, the, deeper, they, go, the, more, they, reduce, their, activity, apparently, to, reduce, encounters, with, predators, and, to, conserve, energy, swimming, activity, in, krill, varies, with, stomach, fullness, sated, animals, that, had, been, feeding, at, the, surface, swim, less, actively, and, therefore, sink, below, the, mixed, layer, as, they, sink, they, produce, feces, which, employs, a, role, in, the, antarctic, carbon, cycle, krill, with, empty, stomachs, swim, more, actively, and, thus, head, towards, the, surface, vertical, migration, may, be, a, 2, 3, times, daily, occurrence, some, species, e, g, euphausia, superba, e, pacifica, e, hanseni, pseudeuphausia, latifrons, and, thysanoessa, spinifera, form, surface, swarms, during, the, day, for, feeding, and, reproductive, purposes, even, though, such, behaviour, is, dangerous, because, it, makes, them, extremely, vulnerable, to, predators, experimental, studies, using, artemia, salina, as, a, model, suggest, that, the, vertical, migrations, of, krill, several, hundreds, of, metres, in, groups, tens, of, metres, deep, could, collectively, create, enough, downward, jets, of, water, to, have, a, significant, effect, on, ocean, mixing, dense, swarms, can, elicit, a, feeding, frenzy, among, fish, birds, and, mammal, predators, especially, near, the, surface, when, disturbed, a, swarm, scatters, and, some, individuals, have, even, been, observed, to, moult, instantly, leaving, the, exuvia, behind, as, a, decoy, krill, normally, swim, at, a, pace, of, 5, 10, cm, s, 2, 3, body, lengths, per, second, using, their, swimmerets, for, propulsion, their, larger, migrations, are, subject, to, ocean, currents, when, in, danger, they, show, an, escape, reaction, called, lobstering, flicking, their, caudal, structures, the, telson, and, the, uropods, they, move, backwards, through, the, water, relatively, quickly, achieving, speeds, in, the, range, of, 10, to, 27, body, lengths, per, second, which, for, large, krill, such, as, e, superba, means, around, 0, 8, m, s, 3, ft, s, their, swimming, performance, has, led, many, researchers, to, classify, adult, krill, as, micro, nektonic, life, forms, i, e, small, animals, capable, of, individual, motion, against, weak, currents, larval, forms, of, krill, are, generally, considered, zooplankton, the, antarctic, krill, is, an, important, species, in, the, context, of, biogeochemical, cycling, and, in, the, antarctic, food, web, it, plays, a, prominent, role, in, the, southern, ocean, because, of, its, ability, to, cycle, nutrients, and, to, feed, penguins, and, baleen, and, blue, whales, krill, have, been, harvested, as, a, food, source, for, humans, and, domesticated, animals, since, at, least, the, 19th, century, and, possibly, earlier, in, japan, where, it, was, known, as, okiami, large, scale, fishing, developed, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, and, now, occurs, only, in, antarctic, waters, and, in, the, seas, around, japan, historically, the, largest, krill, fishery, nations, were, japan, and, the, soviet, union, or, after, the, latter, s, dissolution, russia, and, ukraine, the, harvest, peaked, which, in, 1983, was, about, 528, 000, tonnes, in, the, southern, ocean, alone, of, which, the, soviet, union, took, in, 93, is, now, managed, as, a, precaution, against, overfishing, in, 1993, two, events, caused, a, decline, in, krill, fishing, russia, exited, the, industry, and, the, convention, for, the, conservation, of, antarctic, marine, living, resources, ccamlr, defined, maximum, catch, quotas, for, a, sustainable, exploitation, of, antarctic, krill, after, an, october, 2011, review, the, commission, decided, not, to, change, the, quota, the, annual, antarctic, catch, stabilised, at, around, 100, 000, tonnes, which, is, roughly, one, fiftieth, of, the, ccamlr, catch, quota, the, main, limiting, factor, was, probably, high, costs, along, with, political, and, legal, issues, the, japanese, fishery, saturated, at, some, 70, 000, tonnes, although, krill, are, found, worldwide, fishing, in, southern, oceans, are, preferred, because, the, krill, are, more, catchable, and, abundant, in, these, regions, particularly, in, antarctic, seas, which, are, considered, as, pristine, they, are, considered, a, clean, product, in, 2018, it, was, announced, that, almost, every, krill, fishing, company, operating, in, antarctica, will, abandon, operations, in, huge, areas, around, the, antarctic, peninsula, from, 2020, including, buffer, zones, around, breeding, colonies, of, penguins, although, the, total, biomass, of, antarctic, krill, may, be, as, abundant, as, 400, million, tonnes, the, human, impact, on, this, keystone, species, is, growing, with, a, 39, increase, in, total, fishing, yield, to, 294, 000, tonnes, over, 2010, 2014, major, countries, involved, in, krill, harvesting, are, norway, 56, of, total, catch, in, 2014, the, republic, of, korea, 19, and, china, 18, krill, is, a, rich, source, of, protein, and, omega, 3, fatty, acids, which, are, under, development, in, the, early, 21st, century, as, human, food, dietary, supplements, as, oil, capsules, livestock, food, and, pet, food, krill, tastes, salty, with, a, somewhat, stronger, fish, flavor, than, shrimp, for, mass, consumption, and, commercially, prepared, products, they, must, be, peeled, to, remove, the, inedible, exoskeleton, in, 2011, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, published, a, letter, of, no, objection, for, a, manufactured, krill, oil, product, to, be, generally, recognized, as, safe, gras, for, human, consumption, krill, and, other, planktonic, shrimp, notably, acetes, spp, are, most, widely, consumed, in, southeast, asia, where, it, is, fermented, with, the, shells, intact, and, usually, ground, finely, to, make, shrimp, paste, it, can, be, stir, fried, and, eaten, paired, with, white, rice, or, used, to, add, umami, flavors, to, a, wide, variety, of, traditional, dishes, the, liquid, from, the, fermentation, process, is, also, harvested, as, fish, sauce, krill, are, agile, swimmers, in, the, intermediate, reynolds, number, regime, in, which, there, are, not, many, solutions, for, uncrewed, underwater, robotics, and, have, inspired, robotic, platforms, to, both, study, their, locomotion, as, well, as, find, design, solutions, for, underwater, robots
