30, see, text, icterids, k, t, r, d, or, new, world, blackbirds, make, up, a, family, the, icteridae, k, t, r, d, i, of, small, to, medium, sized, often, colorful, new, world, passerine, birds, the, family, contains, 108, species, and, is, divided, into, 30, genera, most, species, have, black, as, a, predominant, plumage, color, often, enlivened, by, yellow, orange, or, red, the, species, in, the, family, vary, widely, in, size, shape, behavior, and, coloration, the, name, meaning, jaundiced, ones, from, the, prominent, yellow, feathers, of, many, species, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, ikteros, via, the, latin, ictericus, this, group, includes, the, new, world, blackbirds, new, world, orioles, the, bobolink, meadowlarks, grackles, cowbirds, oropendolas, and, caciques, despite, the, similar, names, the, first, groups, are, only, distantly, related, to, the, old, world, common, blackbird, a, thrush, or, the, old, world, orioles, the, icteridae, are, not, to, be, confused, with, the, icteriidae, a, family, created, in, 2017, and, consisting, of, one, species, the, yellow, breasted, chat, icteria, virens, most, icterid, species, live, in, the, tropics, although, many, species, also, occur, in, temperate, regions, such, as, the, red, winged, blackbird, and, the, long, tailed, meadowlark, the, highest, densities, of, breeding, species, are, found, in, colombia, and, southern, mexico, they, inhabit, a, range, of, habitats, including, scrub, swamp, forest, and, savanna, temperate, species, are, migratory, with, many, species, that, nest, in, the, united, states, and, canada, moving, south, into, mexico, and, central, america, icterids, are, variable, in, size, and, often, display, considerable, sexual, dimorphism, with, brighter, coloration, and, greater, size, in, males, being, typical, while, such, dimorphism, is, widely, known, in, passerines, the, sexual, dimorphism, by, size, is, uniquely, extreme, in, icterids, for, example, the, male, great, tailed, grackle, is, 60, heavier, than, the, female, the, smallest, icterid, species, is, the, orchard, oriole, in, which, the, female, averages, 15, cm, in, length, 6, in, and, 18, g, 0, 040, lb, in, weight, while, the, largest, is, the, amazonian, oropendola, the, male, of, which, measures, 52, cm, 20, in, and, weighs, about, 550, g, 1, 21, lb, this, variation, is, greater, than, in, any, other, passerine, family, unless, the, kinglet, calyptura, belongs, with, the, cotingas, which, would, then, have, greater, variation, one, unusual, morphological, adaptation, shared, by, the, icterids, is, gaping, where, the, skull, is, configured, to, allow, them, to, open, their, bills, strongly, rather, than, passively, allowing, them, to, force, open, gaps, to, obtain, otherwise, hidden, food, most, icterids, have, rounded, tails, and, lack, rictal, bristles, they, have, nine, primary, feathers, and, are, placed, among, the, nine, primaried, oscines, icterids, have, adapted, to, taking, a, wide, range, of, foods, oropendolas, and, caciques, use, their, gaping, motion, to, open, the, skins, of, fruit, to, obtain, the, soft, insides, and, have, long, bills, adapted, to, the, process, others, such, as, cowbirds, and, the, bobolink, have, shorter, stubbier, bills, for, crushing, seeds, the, jamaican, blackbird, uses, its, bill, to, pry, amongst, tree, bark, and, epiphytes, and, has, adopted, the, evolutionary, niche, filled, elsewhere, in, the, neotropics, by, woodcreepers, orioles, drink, nectar, the, nesting, habits, of, these, birds, are, also, variable, including, pendulous, woven, nests, in, the, oropendolas, and, orioles, many, icterids, are, colonial, nesting, in, colonies, of, up, to, 100, 000, birds, some, cowbird, species, engage, in, brood, parasitism, females, lay, their, eggs, in, the, nests, of, other, species, in, a, similar, fashion, to, some, cuckoos, some, species, of, icterid, have, become, agricultural, pests, for, example, red, winged, blackbirds, in, the, united, states, are, considered, the, worst, vertebrate, pests, on, some, crops, such, as, rice, the, cost, of, controlling, blackbirds, in, california, was, 30, per, acre, in, 1994, not, all, species, have, been, as, successful, and, a, number, of, species, are, threatened, with, extinction, these, include, insular, forms, such, as, the, jamaican, blackbird, yellow, shouldered, blackbird, and, st, lucia, oriole, all, threatened, by, habitat, loss, and, the, tricolored, blackbird, of, california, which, is, threatened, by, habitat, loss, and, destruction, of, nests, cacique, and, oropendola, species, are, called, paucar, or, similar, names, in, peru, as, paucares, are, considered, very, intelligent, native, americans, feed, the, brains, to, their, children, to, make, them, fast, learners, as, the, male, plays, no, part, in, nesting, and, care, of, the, young, a, man, who, does, not, work, may, be, called, a, male, paucar, the, family, group, was, introduced, in, 1825, as, a, subfamily, icterina, by, irish, zoologist, nicholas, vigors, he, placed, the, subfamily, in, the, starling, family, sturnidae, a, phylogenetic, analysis, of, the, passerine, families, by, carl, oliveros, and, collaborators, published, in, 2019, found, that, the, family, icteridae, was, sister, to, the, family, icteriidae, containing, the, yellow, breasted, chat, and, together, these, two, families, formed, a, clade, that, was, sister, to, the, new, world, warbler, family, parulidae, parulidae, new, world, warblers, 120, species, icteriidae, yellow, breasted, chat, icteridae, the, genus, level, cladogram, shown, below, is, based, on, a, molecular, phylogenetic, study, by, alexis, powell, and, collaborators, that, was, published, in, 2014, the, study, compared, mitochondrial, gene, sequences, the, subfamilies, are, those, that, were, proposed, in, 2016, by, van, remsen, and, collaborators, the, numbers, of, species, are, taken, from, the, list, maintained, by, frank, gill, pamela,
