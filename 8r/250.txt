ontogeny, also, ontogenesis, is, the, origination, and, development, of, an, organism, both, physical, and, psychological, e, g, moral, development, usually, from, the, time, of, fertilization, of, the, egg, to, adult, the, term, can, also, be, used, to, refer, to, the, study, of, the, entirety, of, an, organism, s, lifespan, ontogeny, is, the, developmental, history, of, an, organism, within, its, own, lifetime, as, distinct, from, phylogeny, which, refers, to, the, evolutionary, history, of, a, species, another, way, to, think, of, ontogeny, is, that, it, is, the, process, of, an, organism, going, through, all, of, the, developmental, stages, over, its, lifetime, the, developmental, history, includes, all, the, developmental, events, that, occur, during, the, existence, of, an, organism, beginning, with, the, changes, in, the, egg, at, the, time, of, fertilization, and, events, from, the, time, of, birth, or, hatching, and, afterward, i, e, growth, remolding, of, body, shape, development, of, secondary, sexual, characteristics, etc, while, developmental, i, e, ontogenetic, processes, can, influence, subsequent, evolutionary, e, g, phylogenetic, processes, see, evolutionary, developmental, biology, and, recapitulation, theory, individual, organisms, develop, ontogeny, while, species, evolve, phylogeny, ontogeny, embryology, and, developmental, biology, are, closely, related, studies, and, those, terms, are, sometimes, used, interchangeably, aspects, of, ontogeny, are, morphogenesis, the, development, of, form, and, shape, of, an, organism, tissue, growth, and, cellular, differentiation, the, term, ontogeny, has, also, been, used, in, cell, biology, to, describe, the, development, of, various, cell, types, within, an, organism, ontogeny, is, a, useful, field, of, study, in, many, disciplines, including, developmental, biology, cell, biology, genetics, developmental, psychology, developmental, cognitive, neuroscience, and, developmental, psychobiology, ontogeny, is, used, in, anthropology, as, the, process, through, which, each, of, us, embodies, the, history, of, our, own, making, the, word, ontogeny, comes, from, the, greek, on, meaning, a, being, individual, and, existence, and, from, the, suffix, geny, from, the, greek, geniea, meaning, genesis, origin, and, mode, of, production, the, term, ontogeny, was, coined, by, ernst, haeckel, a, german, zoologist, and, evolutionist, in, the, 1860s, haeckel, born, in, germany, on, february, 16, 1834, was, also, a, strong, supporter, of, darwinism, haeckel, suggested, that, ontogeny, briefly, and, sometimes, incompletely, recapitulated, or, repeated, phylogeny, in, his, 1866, book, generelle, morphologie, der, organismen, general, morphology, of, organisms, even, though, his, book, was, widely, read, the, scientific, community, was, not, very, convinced, or, interested, in, his, ideas, so, he, turned, to, producing, more, publications, to, get, more, attention, in, 1866, haeckel, and, others, imagined, development, as, producing, new, structures, after, earlier, additions, to, the, developing, organism, have, been, established, he, proposed, that, individual, development, followed, developmental, stages, of, previous, generations, and, that, the, future, generations, would, add, something, new, to, this, process, and, that, there, was, a, causal, parallelism, between, an, animal, s, ontogeny, and, phylogeny, in, addition, haeckel, suggested, a, biogenetic, law, that, ontogeny, recapitulates, phylogeny, based, on, the, idea, that, the, successive, and, progressive, origin, of, new, species, was, based, on, the, same, laws, as, the, successive, and, progressive, origin, of, new, embryonic, structures, according, to, haeckel, development, produced, novelties, and, natural, selection, would, eliminate, species, that, had, become, outdated, or, obsolete, though, his, view, of, development, and, evolution, wasn, t, justifiable, future, embryologists, tweaked, and, collaborated, with, haeckel, s, proposals, and, showed, how, new, morphological, structures, can, occur, by, the, hereditary, modification, of, embryonic, development, marine, biologist, walter, garstang, reversed, haeckel, s, relationship, between, ontogeny, and, phylogeny, stating, that, ontogeny, creates, phylogeny, not, recapitulates, it, a, seminal, 1963, paper, by, nikolaas, tinbergen, named, ontogeny, as, one, of, the, four, primary, questions, of, biology, along, with, julian, huxley, s, three, others, causation, survival, value, and, evolution, tinbergen, emphasized, that, the, change, of, behavioral, machinery, during, development, was, distinct, from, the, change, in, behavior, during, development, we, can, conclude, that, the, thrush, itself, i, e, its, behavioral, machinery, has, changed, only, if, the, behavior, change, occurred, while, the, environment, was, held, constant, when, we, turn, from, description, to, causal, analysis, and, ask, in, what, way, the, observed, change, in, behavior, machinery, has, been, brought, about, the, natural, first, step, is, to, try, and, distinguish, between, environmental, influences, and, those, within, the, animal, in, ontogeny, the, conclusion, that, a, certain, change, is, internally, controlled, is, innate, is, reached, by, elimination, tinbergen, was, concerned, that, the, elimination, of, environmental, factors, is, difficult, to, establish, and, the, use, of, the, word, innate, is, often, misleading, development, of, an, organism, happens, through, fertilization, cleavage, blastulation, gastrulation, organogenesis, and, metamorphosis, into, an, adult, each, species, of, animal, has, a, slightly, different, journey, through, these, stages, since, some, stages, might, be, shorter, or, longer, when, compared, to, other, species, and, where, the, offspring, develops, is, different, for, each, animal, type, e, g, in, a, hard, egg, shell, uterus, soft, egg, shell, on, a, plant, leaf, etc, in, humans, the, process, of, fetal, development, starts, after, sperm, fertilizes, an, egg, and, they, fuse, together, kickstarting, embryonic, development, the, fusion, of, egg, and, sperm, into, a, zygote, changes, the, surrounding, membrane, to, not, allow, any, more, sperm, to, penetrate, the, egg, so, multiple, fertilizations, can, be, prevented, fusion, of, a, zygote, also, activates, the, egg, so, it, can, begin, undergoing, cell, division, each, animal, species, might, not, have, specifically, a, sperm, and, an, egg, but, two, gametes, that, contain, half, of, the, species, typical, genetic, material, and, the, membranes, of, these, gametes, fuse, to, start, creating, an, offspring, not, long, after, successful, fertilization, by, sperm, the, zygote, undergoes, many, mitotic, divisions, which, are, also, non, sexual, cell, divisions, cleavage, is, the, process, of, cell, division, so, the, starting, zygote, becomes, a, collection, of, identical, cells, which, is, a, morula, and, contains, cells, called, blastomeres, cleavage, prepares, the, zygote, to, become, an, embryo, which, is, from, 2, weeks, to, 8, weeks, after, conception, fertilization, in, humans, after, the, zygote, has, become, an, embryo, it, continues, dividing, into, a, hollow, sphere, of, cells, which, is, a, blastula, these, outer, cells, form, a, single, epithelial, layer, the, blastoderm, that, essentially, encases, the, fluid, filled, inside, that, is, the, blastocoel, the, figure, to, the, right, shows, the, basic, process, that, is, modified, in, different, species, blastulation, differs, slightly, in, different, species, but, in, mammals, the, eight, cell, stage, embryo, forms, into, a, slightly, different, type, of, blastula, called, a, blastocyst, other, species, such, as, sea, stars, frogs, chicks, and, mice, have, all, the, same, structures, in, this, stage, yet, the, orientation, of, these, features, differs, plus, these, species, have, additional, types, of, cells, in, this, stage, after, blastulation, the, single, layered, blastula, expands, and, reorganizes, into, multiple, layers, a, gastrula, seen, in, the, figure, to, the, right, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, are, triploblastic, organisms, meaning, the, gastrula, comprises, three, germ, layers, the, endoderm, inner, layer, mesoderm, middle, layer, and, ectoderm, outer, layer, as, seen, in, the, figure, below, each, germ, layer, will, become, multi, potent, stem, cells, that, can, become, a, specific, tissue, depending, on, the, germ, layer, and, is, what, happens, in, humans, this, differentiation, of, germ, layers, differs, slightly, because, not, all, of, the, organs, and, tissues, below, are, in, all, organisms, but, corresponding, body, systems, can, be, substituted, in, place, of, these, in, the, figure, below, human, germ, cells, are, able, to, differentiate, into, the, specific, organs, and, tissues, they, become, later, on, in, life, germ, cells, are, able, to, migrate, to, their, final, locations, to, rearrange, themselves, and, some, organs, are, made, of, two, germ, layers, one, for, the, outside, the, other, for, the, inside, the, endoderm, cells, become, the, internal, linings, of, organisms, such, as, the, stomach, colon, small, intestine, liver, and, pancreas, of, the, digestive, system, and, the, lungs, the, mesoderm, gives, rise, to, other, tissues, not, formed, by, the, ectoderm, such, as, the, heart, muscles, bones, blood, dermis, of, the, skin, bone, marrow, and, the, urogenital, system, this, germ, layer, is, more, specific, for, species, as, it, is, the, distinguishing, layer, of, the, three, that, can, identify, evolutionarily, higher, life, forms, e, g, bilateral, organisms, like, humans, from, lower, life, forms, with, radial, symmetry, lastly, the, ectoderm, is, the, outer, layer, of, cells, that, become, the, epidermis, and, hair, while, being, the, precursor, to, the, mammary, glands, central, nervous, system, and, the, peripheral, nervous, systems, the, figure, above, shows, how, the, development, of, a, pig, cow, rabbit, and, human, offspring, are, similar, when, compared, to, one, another, this, figure, shows, how, the, germ, layers, can, become, different, organs, and, tissues, in, evolutionarily, higher, life, forms, and, how, these, species, essentially, develop, very, similarly, additionally, it, shows, how, multiple, species, develop, in, a, parallel, manner, but, branch, off, to, develop, more, specific, features, for, the, organism, such, as, hooves, a, tail, or, ears, in, developing, vertebrate, offspring, a, neural, tube, is, formed, through, either, primary, or, secondary, neurulation, some, species, develop, their, spine, and, nervous, system, using, both, primary, and, secondary, neurulation, while, others, use, only, primary, or, secondary, neurulation, in, human, fetal, development, primary, neurulation, occurs, during, weeks, 3, and, 4, of, gestation, to, develop, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, then, during, weeks, 5, and, 6, of, gestation, secondary, neurulation, forms, the, lower, sacral, and, coccygeal, cord, the, diagram, to, the, right, illustrates, primary, neurulation, which, is, the, process, of, cells, surrounding, the, neural, plate, interacting, with, neural, plate, cells, to, proliferate, converge, and, pinch, off, to, form, a, hollow, tube, above, the, notochord, and, mesoderm, this, process, is, discontinuous, and, can, start, at, different, points, along, the, cranial, caudal, axis, necessary, for, it, to, close, after, the, neural, crest, closes, the, neural, crest, cells, and, ectoderm, cells, separate, and, the, ectoderm, becomes, the, epidermis, surrounding, this, complex, the, neural, crest, cells, differentiate, to, become, components, of, most, of, the, peripheral, nervous, system, in, animals, next, the, notochord, degenerates, to, become, only, the, nucleus, pulposus, of, the, intervertebral, discs, and, the, mesoderm, cells, differentiate, to, become, the, somites, and, skeletal, muscle, later, on, also, during, this, stage, the, neural, crest, cells, become, the, spinal, ganglions, which, function, as, the, brain, in, organisms, like, earthworms, and, arthropods, in, more, advanced, organisms, like, amphibians, birds, and, mammals, the, spinal, ganglions, consists, of, a, cluster, of, nerve, bodies, positioned, along, the, spinal, cord, at, the, dorsal, and, ventral, roots, of, a, spinal, nerve, which, is, a, pair, of, nerves, that, correspond, to, a, vertebra, of, the, spine, in, secondary, neurulation, caudal, and, sacral, regions, of, the, spine, are, formed, after, primary, neurulation, is, finished, this, process, initiates, once, primary, neurulation, is, finished, and, the, posterior, neuropore, closes, so, the, tail, bud, can, proliferate, and, condense, then, create, a, cavity, and, fuse, with, the, central, canal, of, the, neural, tube, secondary, neurulation, occurs, in, the, small, region, starting, at, the, spinal, tail, bud, up, to, the, posterior, neuropore, which, is, the, open, neural, folds, near, the, tail, region, that, don, t, close, through, primary, neurulation, as, canalization, progresses, over, the, next, few, weeks, neurons, and, ependymal, cells, cells, that, create, cerebral, spinal, fluid, differentiate, to, become, the, tail, end, of, the, spinal, cord, next, the, closed, neural, tube, contains, neuroepithelial, cells, that, immediately, divide, after, closure, and, a, second, type, of, cell, forms, the, neuroblast, neuroblast, cells, form, the, mantle, layer, which, later, becomes, the, gray, matter, which, then, gives, rise, to, a, marginal, layer, that, becomes, the, white, matter, of, the, spinal, cord, secondary, neurulation, is, seen, in, the, neural, tube, of, the, lumbar, and, tail, vertebrae, of, frogs, and, chicks, and, in, both, instances, this, process, is, like, a, continuation, of, gastrulation, in, most, species, the, young, organism, that, is, just, born, or, hatched, is, not, sexually, mature, yet, and, in, most, animals, this, young, organism, looks, quite, different, than, the, adult, form, this, young, organism, is, the, larva, and, is, the, intermediate, form, before, metamorphosing, into, an, adult, a, well, known, example, of, a, larval, form, of, an, animal, is, the, caterpillar, of, butterflies, and, moths, caterpillars, keep, growing, and, feeding, in, order, for, enough, energy, during, the, pupal, stage, when, necessary, body, parts, for, metamorphosis, are, grown, the, juvenile, phase, is, different, in, plants, and, animals, but, in, plants, juvenility, is, an, early, phase, of, plant, growth, in, which, plants, can, t, flower, in, animals, the, juvenile, stage, is, most, commonly, found, in, social, mammals, such, as, wild, dogs, monkeys, apes, lions, wolves, and, more, in, humans, puberty, marks, the, end, of, this, stage, and, adolescence, follows, some, species, begin, puberty, and, reproduction, before, the, juvenile, stage, is, over, such, as, in, female, non, human, primates, the, larval, and, pupal, stages, can, be, seen, in, the, figure, to, the, right, the, process, of, an, organism, s, body, undergoing, structural, and, physical, changes, after, birth, or, hatching, to, become, suitable, for, its, adult, environment, is, metamorphosis, for, example, amphibian, tadpoles, have, a, maturation, of, liver, enzymes, hemoglobin, and, eye, pigments, in, addition, to, their, nervous, digestive, and, reproductive, systems, being, remodeled, in, all, species, molting, and, juvenile, hormones, appear, to, regulate, these, changes, the, figure, to, the, right, shows, the, stages, of, life, in, butterflies, and, their, metamorphosis, transforms, the, caterpillar, into, a, butterfly, adulthood, is, the, stage, of, when, physical, and, intellectual, maturity, have, been, achieved, and, this, differs, between, species, in, humans, adulthood, is, thought, to, be, around, 20, or, 21, years, old, and, is, the, longest, stage, of, life, but, in, all, species, it, ends, with, death, in, dogs, small, breeds, e, g, yorkshire, terrier, chihuahua, cocker, spaniel, etc, physically, mature, faster, than, large, breeds, e, g, saint, bernard, great, dane, golden, retriever, etc, so, adulthood, is, reached, anywhere, from, 12, to, 24, months, or, 1, to, 2, years, in, contrast, many, insect, species, have, long, larval, stages, and, the, adult, stage, is, only, for, reproduction, the, silkworm, moths, don, t, have, mouthparts, and, don, t, feed, so, they, have, to, consume, enough, food, during, the, larval, stage, for, energy, to, survive, and, mate, senescence, is, when, cells, stop, dividing, but, don, t, die, but, these, cells, can, build, up, and, cause, problems, in, the, body, these, cells, can, release, substances, that, cause, inflammation, and, can, damage, healthy, nearby, cells, senescence, can, be, induced, by, un, repaired, dna, damage, e, g, from, radiation, old, age, etc, or, other, cellular, stress, and, also, is, the, state, of, being, old, most, organisms, undergo, allometric, changes, in, shape, as, they, grow, and, mature, while, others, engage, in, metamorphosis, even, reptiles, non, avian, sauropsids, e, g, crocodilians, turtles, snakes, and, lizards, in, which, the, offspring, are, often, viewed, as, miniature, adults, show, a, variety, of, ontogenetic, changes, in, morphology, and, physiology
