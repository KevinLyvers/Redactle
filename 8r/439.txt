eurypterids, often, informally, called, sea, scorpions, are, a, group, of, extinct, arthropods, that, form, the, order, eurypterida, the, earliest, known, eurypterids, date, to, the, darriwilian, stage, of, the, ordovician, period, 467, 3, million, years, ago, the, group, is, likely, to, have, appeared, first, either, during, the, early, ordovician, or, late, cambrian, period, with, approximately, 250, species, the, eurypterida, is, the, most, diverse, paleozoic, chelicerate, order, following, their, appearance, during, the, ordovician, eurypterids, became, major, components, of, marine, faunas, during, the, silurian, from, which, the, majority, of, eurypterid, species, have, been, described, the, silurian, genus, eurypterus, accounts, for, more, than, 90, of, all, known, eurypterid, specimens, though, the, group, continued, to, diversify, during, the, subsequent, devonian, period, the, eurypterids, were, heavily, affected, by, the, late, devonian, extinction, event, they, declined, in, numbers, and, diversity, until, becoming, extinct, during, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, or, sometime, shortly, before, 251, 9, million, years, ago, although, popularly, called, sea, scorpions, only, the, earliest, eurypterids, were, marine, many, later, forms, lived, in, brackish, or, fresh, water, and, they, were, not, true, scorpions, some, studies, suggest, that, a, dual, respiratory, system, was, present, which, would, have, allowed, for, short, periods, of, time, in, terrestrial, environments, the, name, eurypterida, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, words, eur, s, meaning, broad, or, wide, and, pter, n, meaning, wing, referring, to, the, pair, of, wide, swimming, appendages, present, in, many, members, of, the, group, the, eurypterid, order, includes, the, largest, known, arthropods, ever, to, have, lived, the, largest, jaekelopterus, reached, 2, 5, meters, 8, 2, ft, in, length, eurypterids, were, not, uniformly, large, and, most, species, were, less, than, 20, centimeters, 8, in, long, the, smallest, eurypterid, alkenopterus, was, only, 2, 03, centimeters, 0, 80, in, long, eurypterid, fossils, have, been, recovered, from, every, continent, a, majority, of, fossils, are, from, fossil, sites, in, north, america, and, europe, because, the, group, lived, primarily, in, the, waters, around, and, within, the, ancient, supercontinent, of, euramerica, only, a, handful, of, eurypterid, groups, spread, beyond, the, confines, of, euramerica, and, a, few, genera, such, as, adelophthalmus, and, pterygotus, achieved, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, with, fossils, being, found, worldwide, like, all, other, arthropods, eurypterids, possessed, segmented, bodies, and, jointed, appendages, limbs, covered, in, a, cuticle, composed, of, proteins, and, chitin, as, in, other, chelicerates, the, body, was, divided, into, two, tagmata, sections, the, frontal, prosoma, head, and, posterior, opisthosoma, abdomen, the, prosoma, was, covered, by, a, carapace, sometimes, called, the, prosomal, shield, on, which, both, compound, eyes, and, the, ocelli, simple, eye, like, sensory, organs, were, located, the, prosoma, also, bore, six, pairs, of, appendages, which, are, usually, referred, to, as, appendage, pairs, i, to, vi, the, first, pair, of, appendages, the, only, pair, placed, before, the, mouth, is, called, the, chelicerae, homologous, to, the, fangs, of, spiders, they, were, equipped, with, small, pincers, used, to, manipulate, food, fragments, and, push, them, into, the, mouth, in, one, lineage, the, pterygotidae, the, chelicerae, were, large, and, long, with, strong, well, developed, teeth, on, specialised, chelae, claws, the, subsequent, pairs, of, appendages, numbers, ii, to, vi, possessed, gnathobases, or, tooth, plates, on, the, coxae, limb, segments, used, for, feeding, these, appendages, were, generally, walking, legs, that, were, cylindrical, in, shape, and, were, covered, in, spines, in, some, species, in, most, lineages, the, limbs, tended, to, get, larger, the, farther, back, they, were, in, the, eurypterina, suborder, the, larger, of, the, two, eurypterid, suborders, the, sixth, pair, of, appendages, was, also, modified, into, a, swimming, paddle, to, aid, in, traversing, aquatic, environments, the, opisthosoma, comprised, 12, segments, and, the, telson, the, posteriormost, division, of, the, body, which, in, most, species, took, the, form, of, a, blade, like, shape, in, some, lineages, notably, the, pterygotioidea, the, hibbertopteridae, and, the, mycteroptidae, the, telson, was, flattened, and, may, have, been, used, as, a, rudder, while, swimming, some, genera, within, the, superfamily, carcinosomatoidea, notably, eusarcana, had, a, telson, similar, to, that, of, modern, scorpions, and, may, have, been, capable, of, using, it, to, inject, venom, the, coxae, of, the, sixth, pair, of, appendages, were, overlaid, by, a, plate, that, is, referred, to, as, the, metastoma, originally, derived, from, a, complete, exoskeleton, segment, the, opisthosoma, itself, can, be, divided, either, into, a, mesosoma, comprising, segments, 1, to, 6, and, metasoma, comprising, segments, 7, to, 12, or, into, a, preabdomen, generally, comprising, segments, 1, to, 7, and, postabdomen, generally, comprising, segments, 8, to, 12, the, underside, of, the, opisthosoma, was, covered, in, structures, evolved, from, modified, opisthosomal, appendages, throughout, the, opisthosoma, these, structures, formed, plate, like, structures, termed, blattf, sse, lit, leaf, feet, in, german, these, created, a, branchial, chamber, gill, tract, between, preceding, blattf, sse, and, the, ventral, surface, of, the, opisthosoma, itself, which, contained, the, respiratory, organs, the, second, to, sixth, opisthosomal, segments, also, contained, oval, or, triangular, organs, that, have, been, interpreted, as, organs, that, aid, in, respiration, these, organs, termed, kiemenplatten, or, gill, tracts, would, potentially, have, aided, eurypterids, to, breathe, air, above, water, while, blattf, ssen, similar, to, organs, in, modern, horseshoe, crabs, would, cover, the, parts, that, serve, for, underwater, respiration, the, appendages, of, opisthosomal, segments, 1, and, 2, the, seventh, and, eighth, segments, overall, were, fused, into, a, structure, termed, the, genital, operculum, occupying, most, of, the, underside, of, the, opisthosomal, segment, 2, near, the, anterior, margin, of, this, structure, the, genital, appendage, also, called, the, zipfel, or, the, median, abdominal, appendage, protruded, this, appendage, often, preserved, very, prominently, has, consistently, been, interpreted, as, part, of, the, reproductive, system, and, occurs, in, two, recognized, types, assumed, to, correspond, to, male, and, female, eurypterids, were, highly, variable, in, size, depending, on, factors, such, as, lifestyle, living, environment, and, taxonomic, affinity, sizes, around, 100, centimeters, 3, 3, ft, are, common, in, most, eurypterid, groups, the, smallest, eurypterid, alkenopterus, burglahrensis, measured, just, 2, 03, centimeters, 0, 80, in, in, length, the, largest, eurypterid, and, the, largest, known, arthropod, ever, to, have, lived, is, jaekelopterus, rhenaniae, a, chelicera, from, the, emsian, klerf, formation, of, willwerath, germany, measured, 36, 4, centimeters, 14, 3, in, in, length, but, is, missing, a, quarter, of, its, length, suggesting, that, the, full, chelicera, would, have, been, 45, 5, centimeters, 17, 9, in, long, if, the, proportions, between, body, length, and, chelicerae, match, those, of, its, closest, relatives, where, the, ratio, between, claw, size, and, body, length, is, relatively, consistent, the, specimen, of, jaekelopterus, that, possessed, the, chelicera, in, question, would, have, measured, between, 233, and, 259, centimeters, 7, 64, and, 8, 50, ft, an, average, 2, 5, meters, 8, 2, ft, in, length, with, the, chelicerae, extended, another, meter, 3, 28, ft, would, be, added, to, this, length, this, estimate, exceeds, the, maximum, body, size, of, all, other, known, giant, arthropods, by, almost, half, a, meter, 1, 64, ft, even, if, the, extended, chelicerae, are, not, included, two, other, eurypterids, have, also, been, estimated, to, have, reached, lengths, of, 2, 5, metres, erettopterus, grandis, closely, related, to, jaekelopterus, and, hibbertopterus, wittebergensis, but, e, grandis, is, very, fragmentary, and, the, h, wittenbergensis, size, estimate, is, based, on, trackway, evidence, not, fossil, remains, the, family, of, jaekelopterus, the, pterygotidae, is, noted, for, several, unusually, large, species, both, acutiramus, whose, largest, member, a, bohemicus, measured, 2, 1, meters, 6, 9, ft, and, pterygotus, whose, largest, species, p, grandidentatus, measured, 1, 75, meters, 5, 7, ft, were, gigantic, several, different, contributing, factors, to, the, large, size, of, the, pterygotids, have, been, suggested, including, courtship, behaviour, predation, and, competition, over, environmental, resources, giant, eurypterids, were, not, limited, to, the, family, pterygotidae, an, isolated, 12, 7, centimeters, 5, 0, in, long, fossil, metastoma, of, the, carcinosomatoid, eurypterid, carcinosoma, punctatum, indicates, the, animal, would, have, reached, a, length, of, 2, 2, meters, 7, 2, ft, in, life, rivalling, the, pterygotids, in, size, another, giant, was, pentecopterus, decorahensis, a, primitive, carcinosomatoid, which, is, estimated, to, have, reached, lengths, of, 1, 7, meters, 5, 6, ft, typical, of, large, eurypterids, is, a, lightweight, build, factors, such, as, locomotion, energy, costs, in, molting, and, respiration, as, well, as, the, actual, physical, properties, of, the, exoskeleton, limit, the, size, that, arthropods, can, reach, a, lightweight, construction, significantly, decreases, the, influence, of, these, factors, pterygotids, were, particularly, lightweight, with, most, fossilized, large, body, segments, preserving, as, thin, and, unmineralized, lightweight, adaptations, are, present, in, other, giant, paleozoic, arthropods, as, well, such, as, the, giant, millipede, arthropleura, and, are, possibly, vital, for, the, evolution, of, giant, size, in, arthropods, in, addition, to, the, lightweight, giant, eurypterids, some, deep, bodied, forms, in, the, family, hibbertopteridae, were, also, very, large, a, carapace, from, the, carboniferous, of, scotland, referred, to, the, species, hibbertoperus, scouleri, measures, 65, cm, 26, in, wide, as, hibbertopterus, was, very, wide, compared, to, its, length, the, animal, in, question, could, possibly, have, measured, just, short, of, 2, meters, 6, 6, ft, in, length, more, robust, than, the, pterygotids, this, giant, hibbertopterus, would, possibly, have, rivalled, the, largest, pterygotids, in, weight, if, not, surpassed, them, and, as, such, be, among, the, heaviest, arthropods, the, two, eurypterid, suborders, eurypterina, and, stylonurina, are, distinguished, primarily, by, the, morphology, of, their, final, pair, of, appendages, in, the, stylonurina, this, appendage, takes, the, form, of, a, long, and, slender, walking, leg, while, in, the, eurypterina, the, leg, is, modified, and, broadened, into, a, swimming, paddle, other, than, the, swimming, paddle, the, legs, of, many, eurypterines, were, far, too, small, to, do, much, more, than, allow, them, to, crawl, across, the, sea, floor, in, contrast, a, number, of, stylonurines, had, elongated, and, powerful, legs, that, might, have, allowed, them, to, walk, on, land, similar, to, modern, crabs, a, fossil, trackway, was, discovered, in, carboniferous, aged, fossil, deposits, of, scotland, in, 2005, it, was, attributed, to, the, stylonurine, eurypterid, hibbertopterus, due, to, a, matching, size, the, trackmaker, was, estimated, to, have, been, about, 1, 6, meters, 5, 2, ft, long, and, inferred, leg, anatomy, it, is, the, largest, terrestrial, trackway, measuring, 6, meters, 20, ft, long, and, averaging, 95, centimeters, 3, 12, ft, in, width, made, by, an, arthropod, found, thus, far, it, is, the, first, record, of, land, locomotion, by, a, eurypterid, the, trackway, provides, evidence, that, some, eurypterids, could, survive, in, terrestrial, environments, at, least, for, short, periods, of, time, and, reveals, information, about, the, stylonurine, gait, in, hibbertopterus, as, in, most, eurypterids, the, pairs, of, appendages, are, different, in, size, referred, to, as, a, heteropodous, limb, condition, these, differently, sized, pairs, would, have, moved, in, phase, and, the, short, stride, length, indicates, that, hibbertopterus, crawled, with, an, exceptionally, slow, speed, at, least, on, land, the, large, telson, was, dragged, along, the, ground, and, left, a, large, central, groove, behind, the, animal, slopes, in, the, tracks, at, random, intervals, suggest, that, the, motion, was, jerky, the, gait, of, smaller, stylonurines, such, as, parastylonurus, was, probably, faster, and, more, precise, the, functionality, of, the, eurypterine, swimming, paddles, varied, from, group, to, group, in, the, eurypteroidea, the, paddles, were, similar, in, shape, to, oars, the, condition, of, the, joints, in, their, appendages, ensured, their, paddles, could, only, be, moved, in, near, horizontal, planes, not, upwards, or, downwards, some, other, groups, such, as, the, pterygotioidea, would, not, have, possessed, this, condition, and, were, probably, able, to, swim, faster, most, eurypterines, are, generally, agreed, to, have, utilized, a, rowing, type, of, propulsion, similar, to, that, of, crabs, and, water, beetles, larger, individuals, may, have, been, capable, of, underwater, flying, or, subaqueous, flight, in, which, the, motion, and, shape, of, the, paddles, are, enough, to, generate, lift, similar, to, the, swimming, of, sea, turtles, and, sea, lions, this, type, of, movement, has, a, relatively, slower, acceleration, rate, than, the, rowing, type, especially, since, adults, have, proportionally, smaller, paddles, than, juveniles, however, since, the, larger, sizes, of, adults, mean, a, higher, drag, coefficient, using, this, type, of, propulsion, is, more, energy, efficient, some, eurypterines, such, as, mixopterus, as, inferred, from, attributed, fossil, trackways, were, not, necessarily, good, swimmers, it, likely, kept, mostly, to, the, bottom, using, its, swimming, paddles, for, occasional, bursts, of, movements, vertically, with, the, fourth, and, fifth, pairs, of, appendages, positioned, backwards, to, produce, minor, movement, forwards, while, walking, it, probably, used, a, gait, like, that, of, most, modern, insects, the, weight, of, its, long, abdomen, would, have, been, balanced, by, two, heavy, and, specialized, frontal, appendages, and, the, center, of, gravity, might, have, been, adjustable, by, raising, and, positioning, the, tail, preserved, fossilized, eurypterid, trackways, tend, to, be, large, and, heteropodous, and, often, have, an, associated, telson, drag, mark, along, the, mid, line, as, with, the, scottish, hibbertopterus, track, such, trackways, have, been, discovered, on, every, continent, except, for, south, america, in, some, places, where, eurypterid, fossil, remains, are, otherwise, rare, such, as, in, south, africa, and, the, rest, of, the, former, supercontinent, gondwana, the, discoveries, of, trackways, both, predate, and, outnumber, eurypterid, body, fossils, eurypterid, trackways, have, been, referred, to, several, ichnogenera, most, notably, palmichnium, defined, as, a, series, of, four, tracks, often, with, an, associated, drag, mark, in, the, mid, line, wherein, the, holotype, of, the, ichnospecies, p, kosinkiorum, preserves, the, largest, eurypterid, footprints, known, to, date, with, the, found, tracks, each, being, about, 7, 6, centimeters, 3, 0, in, in, diameter, other, eurypterid, ichnogenera, include, merostomichnites, though, it, is, likely, that, many, specimens, actually, represent, trackways, of, crustaceans, and, arcuites, which, preserves, grooves, made, by, the, swimming, appendages, in, eurypterids, the, respiratory, organs, were, located, on, the, ventral, body, wall, the, underside, of, the, opisthosoma, blattf, sse, evolved, from, opisthosomal, appendages, covered, the, underside, and, created, a, gill, chamber, where, the, gill, tracts, were, located, depending, on, the, species, the, eurypterid, gill, tract, was, either, triangular, or, oval, in, shape, and, was, possibly, raised, into, a, cushion, like, state, the, surface, of, this, gill, tract, bore, several, spinules, small, spines, which, resulted, in, an, enlarged, surface, area, it, was, composed, of, spongy, tissue, due, to, many, invaginations, in, the, structure, though, the, kiemenplatte, is, referred, to, as, a, gill, tract, it, may, not, necessarily, have, functioned, as, actual, gills, in, other, animals, gills, are, used, for, oxygen, uptake, from, water, and, are, outgrowths, of, the, body, wall, despite, eurypterids, clearly, being, primarily, aquatic, animals, that, almost, certainly, evolved, underwater, some, eurypterids, such, as, the, pterygotids, would, even, have, been, physically, unable, to, walk, on, land, it, is, unlikely, the, gill, tract, contained, functional, gills, when, comparing, the, organ, to, gills, in, other, invertebrates, and, even, fish, previous, interpretations, often, identified, the, eurypterid, gills, as, homologous, with, those, of, other, groups, hence, the, terminology, with, gas, exchange, occurring, within, the, spongy, tract, and, a, pattern, of, branchio, cardiac, and, dendritic, veins, as, in, related, groups, carrying, oxygenated, blood, into, the, body, the, primary, analogy, used, in, previous, studies, has, been, horseshoe, crabs, though, their, gill, structure, and, that, of, eurypterids, are, remarkably, different, in, horseshoe, crabs, the, gills, are, more, complex, and, composed, of, many, lamellae, plates, which, give, a, larger, surface, area, used, for, gas, exchange, in, addition, the, gill, tract, of, eurypterids, is, proportionally, much, too, small, to, support, them, if, it, is, analogous, to, the, gills, of, other, groups, to, be, functional, gills, they, would, have, to, have, been, highly, efficient, and, would, have, required, a, highly, efficient, circulatory, system, it, is, considered, unlikely, however, that, these, factors, would, be, enough, to, explain, the, large, discrepancy, between, gill, tract, size, and, body, size, it, has, been, suggested, instead, that, the, gill, tract, was, an, organ, for, breathing, air, perhaps, actually, being, a, lung, plastron, or, a, pseudotrachea, plastrons, are, organs, that, some, arthropods, evolved, secondarily, to, breathe, air, underwater, this, is, considered, an, unlikely, explanation, since, eurypterids, had, evolved, in, water, from, the, start, and, they, would, not, have, organs, evolved, from, air, breathing, organs, present, in, addition, plastrons, are, generally, exposed, on, outer, parts, of, the, body, while, the, eurypterid, gill, tract, is, located, behind, the, blattf, ssen, instead, among, arthropod, respiratory, organs, the, eurypterid, gill, tracts, most, closely, resemble, the, pseudotracheae, found, in, modern, isopods, these, organs, called, pseudotracheae, because, of, some, resemblance, to, the, tracheae, windpipes, of, air, breathing, organisms, are, lung, like, and, present, within, the, pleopods, back, legs, of, isopods, the, structure, of, the, pseudotracheae, has, been, compared, to, the, spongy, structure, of, the, eurypterid, gill, tracts, it, is, possible, the, two, organs, functioned, in, the, same, way, some, researchers, have, suggested, that, eurypterids, may, have, been, adapted, to, an, amphibious, lifestyle, using, the, full, gill, tract, structure, as, gills, and, the, invaginations, within, it, as, pseudotrachea, this, mode, of, life, may, not, have, been, physiologically, possible, however, since, water, pressure, would, have, forced, water, into, the, invaginations, leading, to, asphyxiation, furthermore, most, eurypterids, would, have, been, aquatic, their, entire, lives, no, matter, how, much, time, was, spent, on, land, organs, for, respiration, in, underwater, environments, must, have, been, present, true, gills, expected, to, have, been, located, within, the, branchial, chamber, within, the, blattf, ssen, remain, unknown, in, eurypterids, like, all, arthropods, eurypterids, matured, and, grew, through, static, developmental, stages, referred, to, as, instars, these, instars, were, punctuated, by, periods, during, which, eurypterids, went, through, ecdysis, molting, of, the, cuticle, after, which, they, underwent, rapid, and, immediate, growth, some, arthropods, such, as, insects, and, many, crustaceans, undergo, extreme, changes, over, the, course, of, maturing, chelicerates, including, eurypterids, are, in, general, considered, to, be, direct, developers, undergoing, no, extreme, changes, after, hatching, though, extra, body, segments, and, extra, limbs, may, be, gained, over, the, course, of, ontogeny, in, some, lineages, such, as, xiphosurans, and, sea, spiders, whether, eurypterids, were, true, direct, developers, with, hatchlings, more, or, less, being, identical, to, adults, or, hemianamorphic, direct, developers, with, extra, segments, and, limbs, potentially, being, added, during, ontogeny, has, been, controversial, in, the, past, hemianamorphic, direct, development, has, been, observed, in, many, arthropod, groups, such, as, trilobites, megacheirans, basal, crustaceans, and, basal, myriapods, true, direct, development, has, on, occasion, been, referred, to, as, a, trait, unique, to, arachnids, there, have, been, few, studies, on, eurypterid, ontogeny, as, there, is, a, general, lack, of, specimens, in, the, fossil, record, that, can, confidently, be, stated, to, represent, juveniles, it, is, possible, that, many, eurypterid, species, thought, to, be, distinct, actually, represent, juvenile, specimens, of, other, species, with, paleontologists, rarely, considering, the, influence, of, ontogeny, when, describing, new, species, studies, on, a, well, preserved, fossil, assemblage, of, eurypterids, from, the, pragian, aged, beartooth, butte, formation, in, cottonwood, canyon, wyoming, composed, of, multiple, specimens, of, various, developmental, stages, of, eurypterids, jaekelopterus, and, strobilopterus, revealed, that, eurypterid, ontogeny, was, more, or, less, parallel, and, similar, to, that, of, extinct, and, extant, xiphosurans, with, the, largest, exception, being, that, eurypterids, hatched, with, a, full, set, of, appendages, and, opisthosomal, segments, eurypterids, were, thus, not, hemianamorphic, direct, developers, but, true, direct, developers, like, modern, arachnids, the, most, frequently, observed, change, occurring, through, ontogeny, except, for, some, genera, such, as, eurypterus, which, appear, to, have, been, static, is, the, metastoma, becoming, proportionally, less, wide, this, ontogenetic, change, has, been, observed, in, members, of, several, superfamilies, such, as, the, eurypteroidea, the, pterygotioidea, and, the, moselopteroidea, no, fossil, gut, contents, from, eurypterids, are, known, so, direct, evidence, of, their, diet, is, lacking, the, eurypterid, biology, is, particularly, suggestive, of, a, carnivorous, lifestyle, not, only, were, many, large, in, general, most, predators, tend, to, be, larger, than, their, prey, but, they, had, stereoscopic, vision, the, ability, to, perceive, depth, the, legs, of, many, eurypterids, were, covered, in, thin, spines, used, both, for, locomotion, and, the, gathering, of, food, in, some, groups, these, spiny, appendages, became, heavily, specialized, in, some, eurypterids, in, the, carcinosomatoidea, forward, facing, appendages, were, large, and, possessed, enormously, elongated, spines, as, in, mixopterus, and, megalograptus, in, derived, members, of, the, pterygotioidea, the, appendages, were, completely, without, spines, but, had, specialized, claws, instead, other, eurypterids, lacking, these, specialized, appendages, likely, fed, in, a, manner, similar, to, modern, horseshoe, crabs, by, grabbing, and, shredding, food, with, their, appendages, before, pushing, it, into, their, mouth, using, their, chelicerae, fossils, preserving, digestive, tracts, have, been, reported, from, fossils, of, various, eurypterids, among, them, carcinosoma, acutiramus, and, eurypterus, though, a, potential, anal, opening, has, been, reported, from, the, telson, of, a, specimen, of, buffalopterus, it, is, more, likely, that, the, anus, was, opened, through, the, thin, cuticle, between, the, last, segment, before, the, telson, and, the, telson, itself, as, in, modern, horseshoe, crabs, eurypterid, coprolites, discovered, in, deposits, of, ordovician, age, in, ohio, containing, fragments, of, a, trilobite, and, eurypterid, megalograptus, ohioensis, in, association, with, full, specimens, of, the, same, eurypterid, species, have, been, suggested, to, represent, evidence, of, cannibalism, similar, coprolites, referred, to, the, species, lanarkopterus, dolichoschelus, from, the, ordovician, of, ohio, contain, fragments, of, jawless, fish, and, fragments, of, smaller, specimens, of, lanarkopterus, itself, though, apex, predatory, roles, would, have, been, limited, to, the, very, largest, eurypterids, smaller, eurypterids, were, likely, formidable, predators, in, their, own, right, just, like, their, larger, relatives, as, in, many, other, entirely, extinct, groups, understanding, and, researching, the, reproduction, and, sexual, dimorphism, of, eurypterids, is, difficult, as, they, are, only, known, from, fossilized, shells, and, carapaces, in, some, cases, there, might, not, be, enough, apparent, differences, to, separate, the, sexes, based, on, morphology, alone, sometimes, two, sexes, of, the, same, species, have, been, interpreted, as, two, different, species, as, was, the, case, with, two, species, of, drepanopterus, d, bembycoides, and, d, lobatus, the, eurypterid, prosoma, is, made, up, of, the, first, six, exoskeleton, segments, fused, together, into, a, larger, structure, the, seventh, segment, thus, the, first, opisthosomal, segment, is, referred, to, as, the, metastoma, and, the, eighth, segment, distinctly, plate, like, is, called, the, operculum, and, contains, the, genital, aperature, the, underside, of, this, segment, is, occupied, by, the, genital, operculum, a, structure, originally, evolved, from, ancestral, seventh, and, eighth, pair, of, appendages, in, its, center, as, in, modern, horseshoe, crabs, is, a, genital, appendage, this, appendage, an, elongated, rod, with, an, internal, duct, is, found, in, two, distinct, morphs, generally, referred, to, as, type, a, and, type, b, these, genital, appendages, are, often, preserved, prominently, in, fossils, and, have, been, the, subject, of, various, interpretations, of, eurypterid, reproduction, and, sexual, dimorphism, type, a, appendages, are, generally, longer, than, those, of, type, b, in, some, genera, they, are, divided, into, different, numbers, of, sections, such, as, in, eurypterus, where, the, type, a, appendage, is, divided, into, three, but, the, type, b, appendage, into, only, two, such, division, of, the, genital, appendage, is, common, in, eurypterids, but, the, number, is, not, universal, for, instance, the, appendages, of, both, types, in, the, family, pterygotidae, are, undivided, the, type, a, appendage, is, also, armed, with, two, curved, spines, called, furca, lit, fork, in, latin, the, presence, of, furca, in, the, type, b, appendage, is, also, possible, and, the, structure, may, represent, the, unfused, tips, of, the, appendages, located, between, the, dorsal, and, ventral, surfaces, of, the, blattf, sse, associated, with, the, type, a, appendages, is, a, set, of, organs, traditionally, described, as, either, tubular, organs, or, horn, organs, these, organs, are, most, often, interpreted, as, spermathecae, organs, for, storing, sperm, though, this, function, is, yet, to, be, proven, conclusively, in, arthropods, spermathecae, are, used, to, store, the, spermatophore, received, from, males, this, would, imply, that, the, type, a, appendage, is, the, female, morph, and, the, type, b, appendage, is, the, male, further, evidence, for, the, type, a, appendages, representing, the, female, morph, of, genital, appendages, comes, in, their, more, complex, construction, a, general, trend, for, female, arthropod, genitalia, it, is, possible, that, the, greater, length, of, the, type, a, appendage, means, that, it, was, used, as, an, ovipositor, used, to, deposit, eggs, the, different, types, of, genital, appendages, are, not, necessarily, the, only, feature, that, distinguishes, between, the, sexes, of, eurypterids, depending, on, the, genus, and, species, in, question, other, features, such, as, size, the, amount, of, ornamentation, and, the, proportional, width, of, the, body, can, be, the, result, of, sexual, dimorphism, in, general, eurypterids, with, type, b, appendages, males, appear, to, have, been, proportionally, wider, than, eurypterids, with, type, a, appendages, females, of, the, same, genera, the, primary, function, of, the, long, assumed, female, type, a, appendages, was, likely, to, take, up, spermatophore, from, the, substrate, into, the, reproductive, tract, rather, than, to, serve, as, an, ovipositor, as, arthropod, ovipositors, are, generally, longer, than, eurypterid, type, a, appendages, by, rotating, the, sides, of, the, operculum, it, would, have, been, possible, to, lower, the, appendage, from, the, body, due, to, the, way, different, plates, overlay, at, its, location, the, appendage, would, have, been, impossible, to, move, without, muscular, contractions, moving, around, the, operculum, it, would, have, been, kept, in, place, when, not, it, use, the, furca, on, the, type, a, appendages, may, have, aided, in, breaking, open, the, spermatophore, to, release, the, free, sperm, inside, for, uptake, the, horn, organs, possibly, spermathecae, are, thought, to, have, been, connected, directly, to, the, appendage, via, tracts, but, these, supposed, tracts, remain, unpreserved, in, available, fossil, material, type, b, appendages, assumed, male, would, have, produced, stored, and, perhaps, shaped, spermatophore, in, a, heart, shaped, structure, on, the, dorsal, surface, of, the, appendage, a, broad, genital, opening, would, have, allowed, large, amounts, of, spermatophore, to, be, released, at, once, the, long, furca, associated, with, type, b, appendages, perhaps, capable, of, being, lowered, like, the, type, a, appendage, could, have, been, used, to, detect, whether, a, substrate, was, suitable, for, spermatophore, deposition, until, 1882, no, eurypterids, were, known, from, before, the, silurian, contemporary, discoveries, since, the, 1880s, have, expanded, the, knowledge, of, early, eurypterids, from, the, ordovician, period, the, earliest, eurypterids, known, today, the, megalograptid, pentecopterus, date, from, the, darriwilian, stage, of, the, middle, ordovician, 467, 3, million, years, ago, there, are, also, reports, of, even, earlier, fossil, eurypterids, in, the, fezouata, biota, of, late, tremadocian, early, ordovician, age, in, morocco, but, these, have, yet, to, be, thoroughly, studied, and, are, likely, to, be, peytoiid, appendages, pentecopterus, was, a, relatively, derived, eurypterid, part, of, the, megalograptid, family, within, the, carcinosomatoid, superfamily, its, derived, position, suggests, that, most, eurypterid, clades, at, least, within, the, eurypterine, suborder, had, already, been, established, at, this, point, during, the, middle, ordovician, the, earliest, known, stylonurine, eurypterid, brachyopterus, is, also, middle, ordovician, in, age, the, presence, of, members, of, both, suborders, indicates, that, primitive, stem, eurypterids, would, have, preceded, them, though, these, are, so, far, unknown, in, the, fossil, record, the, presence, of, several, eurypterid, clades, during, the, middle, ordovician, suggests, that, eurypterids, either, originated, during, the, early, ordovician, and, experienced, a, rapid, and, explosive, radiation, and, diversification, soon, after, the, first, forms, evolved, or, that, the, group, originated, much, earlier, perhaps, during, the, cambrian, period, as, such, the, exact, eurypterid, time, of, origin, remains, unknown, though, fossils, referred, to, as, primitive, eurypterids, have, occasionally, been, described, from, deposits, of, cambrian, or, even, precambrian, age, they, are, not, recognized, as, eurypterids, and, sometimes, not, even, as, related, forms, today, some, animals, previously, seen, as, primitive, eurypterids, such, as, the, genus, strabops, from, the, cambrian, of, missouri, are, now, classified, as, aglaspidids, or, strabopids, the, aglaspidids, once, seen, as, primitive, chelicerates, are, now, seen, as, a, group, more, closely, related, to, trilobites, the, fossil, record, of, ordovician, eurypterids, is, quite, poor, the, majority, of, eurypterids, once, reportedly, known, from, the, ordovician, have, since, proven, to, be, misidentifications, or, pseudofossils, today, only, 11, species, can, be, confidently, identified, as, representing, ordovician, eurypterids, these, taxa, fall, into, two, distinct, ecological, categories, large, and, active, predators, from, the, ancient, continent, of, laurentia, and, demersal, living, on, the, seafloor, and, basal, animals, from, the, continents, avalonia, and, gondwana, the, laurentian, predators, classified, in, the, family, megalograptidae, comprising, the, genera, echinognathus, megalograptus, and, pentecopterus, are, likely, to, represent, the, first, truly, successful, eurypterid, group, experiencing, a, small, radiation, during, the, late, ordovician, eurypterids, were, most, diverse, and, abundant, between, the, middle, silurian, and, the, early, devonian, with, an, absolute, peak, in, diversity, during, the, pridoli, epoch, 423, to, 419, 2, million, years, ago, of, the, very, latest, silurian, this, peak, in, diversity, has, been, recognized, since, the, early, twentieth, century, of, the, approximately, 150, species, of, eurypterids, known, in, 1916, more, than, half, were, from, the, silurian, and, a, third, were, from, the, late, silurian, alone, though, stylonurine, eurypterids, generally, remained, rare, and, low, in, number, as, had, been, the, case, during, the, preceding, ordovician, eurypterine, eurypterids, experienced, a, rapid, rise, in, diversity, and, number, in, most, silurian, fossil, beds, eurypterine, eurypterids, account, for, 90, of, all, eurypterids, present, though, some, were, likely, already, present, by, the, late, ordovician, simply, missing, from, the, fossil, record, so, far, a, vast, majority, of, eurypterid, groups, are, first, recorded, in, strata, of, silurian, age, these, include, both, stylonurine, groups, such, as, the, stylonuroidea, kokomopteroidea, and, mycteropoidea, as, well, as, eurypterine, groups, such, as, the, pterygotioidea, eurypteroidea, and, waeringopteroidea, the, most, successful, eurypterid, by, far, was, the, middle, to, late, silurian, eurypterus, a, generalist, equally, likely, to, have, engaged, in, predation, or, scavenging, thought, to, have, hunted, mainly, small, and, soft, bodied, invertebrates, such, as, worms, species, of, the, genus, of, which, the, most, common, is, the, type, species, e, remipes, account, for, more, than, 90, perhaps, as, many, as, 95, of, all, known, fossil, eurypterid, specimens, despite, their, vast, number, eurypterus, are, only, known, from, a, relatively, short, temporal, range, first, appearing, during, the, late, llandovery, epoch, around, 432, million, years, ago, and, being, extinct, by, the, end, of, the, pridoli, epoch, eurypterus, was, also, restricted, to, the, continent, euramerica, composed, of, the, equatorial, continents, avalonia, baltica, and, laurentia, which, had, been, completely, colonized, by, the, genus, during, its, merging, and, was, unable, to, cross, the, vast, expanses, of, ocean, separating, this, continent, from, other, parts, of, the, world, such, as, the, southern, supercontinent, gondwana, as, such, eurypterus, was, limited, geographically, to, the, coastlines, and, shallow, inland, seas, of, euramerica, during, the, late, silurian, the, pterygotid, eurypterids, large, and, specialized, forms, with, several, new, adaptations, such, as, large, and, flattened, telsons, capable, of, being, used, as, rudders, and, large, and, specialized, chelicerae, with, enlarged, pincers, for, handling, and, potentially, in, some, cases, killing, prey, appeared, though, the, largest, members, of, the, family, appeared, in, the, devonian, large, two, meter, 6, 5, ft, pterygotids, such, as, acutiramus, were, already, present, during, the, late, silurian, their, ecology, ranged, from, generalized, predatory, behavior, to, ambush, predation, and, some, such, as, pterygotus, itself, were, active, apex, predators, in, late, silurian, marine, ecosystems, the, pterygotids, were, also, evidently, capable, of, crossing, oceans, becoming, one, of, only, two, eurypterid, groups, to, achieve, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, though, the, eurypterids, continued, to, be, abundant, and, diversify, during, the, early, devonian, for, instance, leading, to, the, evolution, of, the, pterygotid, jaekelopterus, the, largest, of, all, arthropods, the, group, was, one, of, many, heavily, affected, by, the, late, devonian, extinction, the, extinction, event, only, known, to, affect, marine, life, particularly, trilobites, brachiopods, and, reef, building, organisms, effectively, crippled, the, abundance, and, diversity, previously, seen, within, the, eurypterids, a, major, decline, in, diversity, had, already, begun, during, the, early, devonian, and, eurypterids, were, rare, in, marine, environments, by, the, late, devonian, during, the, frasnian, stage, four, families, went, extinct, and, the, later, famennian, saw, an, additional, five, families, going, extinct, as, marine, groups, were, the, most, affected, the, eurypterids, were, primarily, impacted, within, the, eurypterine, suborder, only, one, group, of, stylonurines, the, family, parastylonuridae, went, extinct, in, the, early, devonian, only, two, families, of, eurypterines, survived, into, the, late, devonian, at, all, adelophthalmidae, and, waeringopteridae, the, eurypterines, experienced, their, most, major, declines, in, the, early, devonian, during, which, over, 50, of, their, diversity, was, lost, in, just, 10, million, years, stylonurines, on, the, other, hand, persisted, through, the, period, with, more, or, less, consistent, diversity, and, abundance, but, were, affected, during, the, late, devonian, when, many, of, the, older, groups, were, replaced, by, new, forms, in, the, families, mycteroptidae, and, hibbertopteridae, it, is, possible, that, the, catastrophic, extinction, patterns, seen, in, the, eurypterine, suborder, were, related, to, the, emergence, of, more, derived, fish, eurypterine, decline, began, at, the, point, when, jawless, fish, first, became, more, developed, and, coincides, with, the, emergence, of, placoderms, armored, fish, in, both, north, america, and, europe, stylonurines, of, the, surviving, hibbertopterid, and, mycteroptid, families, completely, avoided, competition, with, fish, by, evolving, towards, a, new, and, distinct, ecological, niche, these, families, experienced, a, radiation, and, diversification, through, the, late, devonian, and, early, carboniferous, the, last, ever, radiation, within, the, eurypterids, which, gave, rise, to, several, new, forms, capable, of, sweep, feeding, raking, through, the, substrate, in, search, of, prey, only, three, eurypterid, families, adelophthalmidae, hibbertopteridae, and, mycteroptidae, survived, the, extinction, event, in, its, entirety, we, used, to, think, that, these, were, all, freshwater, animals, which, would, have, rendered, the, eurypterids, extinct, in, marine, environments, and, with, marine, eurypterid, predators, gone, sarcopterygians, such, as, the, rhizodonts, were, the, new, apex, predators, in, marine, environments, however, various, recent, findings, raise, doubts, about, this, and, suggest, that, these, eurypterids, were, euryhaline, forms, that, lived, in, marginal, marine, environments, such, as, estuaries, deltas, lagoons, and, coastal, ponds, one, argument, is, paleobiogeographical, pterygotoid, distribution, seems, to, require, oceanic, dispersal, a, recent, review, of, adelophthalmoidea, admitted, that, there, is, much, more, of, a, marine, influence, in, many, of, the, sections, yielding, adelophthalmus, than, has, previously, been, acknowledged, similarly, a, study, of, the, eurypterid, hibbertopterus, from, the, carboniferous, of, new, mexico, concluded, that, the, habitat, of, some, eurypterids, may, need, to, be, re, evaluated, the, sole, surviving, eurypterine, family, adelophthalmidae, was, represented, by, only, a, single, genus, adelophthalmus, the, hibbertopterids, mycteroptids, and, adelophthalmus, survived, into, the, permian, adelophthalmus, became, the, most, common, of, all, late, paleozoic, eurypterids, existing, in, greater, number, and, diversity, than, surviving, stylonurines, and, diversified, in, the, absence, of, other, eurypterines, out, of, the, 33, species, referred, to, adelophthalmus, 23, 69, are, from, the, carboniferous, alone, the, genus, reached, its, peak, diversity, in, the, late, carboniferous, though, adelophthalmus, had, already, been, relatively, widespread, and, represented, around, all, major, landmasses, in, the, late, devonian, the, amalgamation, of, pangaea, into, a, global, supercontinent, over, the, course, of, the, last, two, periods, of, the, paleozoic, allowed, adelophthalmus, to, gain, an, almost, worldwide, distribution, during, the, late, carboniferous, and, early, permian, adelophthalmus, was, widespread, living, primarily, in, brackish, and, freshwater, environments, adjacent, to, coastal, plains, these, environments, were, maintained, by, favorable, climate, conditions, they, did, not, persist, as, climate, changes, owing, to, pangaea, s, formation, altered, depositional, and, vegetational, patterns, across, the, world, with, their, habitat, gone, adelophthalmus, dwindled, in, number, and, had, already, gone, extinct, by, the, leonardian, stage, of, the, early, permian, mycteroptids, and, hibbertopterids, continued, to, survive, for, some, time, with, one, genus, of, each, group, known, from, permian, strata, hastimima, and, campylocephalus, respectively, hastimima, went, extinct, during, the, early, permian, as, adelophthalmus, had, while, campylocephalus, persisted, longer, a, massive, incomplete, carapace, from, permian, deposits, in, russia, represents, the, sole, fossil, remains, of, the, species, c, permianus, which, might, have, reached, 1, 4, meters, 4, 6, ft, in, length, while, originally, considered, to, be, late, permian, in, age, other, sources, suggest, a, kungurian, roadian, age, 283, 267, million, years, ago, for, the, specimen, a, fragment, of, eurypterid, cuticle, given, the, species, name, woodwardopterus, freemanorum, is, known, from, the, terminal, permian, of, australia, which, represents, the, youngest, known, eurypterid, no, eurypterids, are, known, from, fossil, beds, higher, than, the, permian, this, indicates, that, the, last, eurypterids, died, either, in, the, catastrophic, extinction, event, at, its, end, or, at, some, point, shortly, before, it, this, extinction, event, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, is, the, most, devastating, mass, extinction, recorded, and, rendered, many, other, successful, paleozoic, groups, such, as, the, trilobites, extinct, the, first, known, eurypterid, specimen, was, discovered, in, the, silurian, aged, rocks, of, new, york, to, this, day, one, of, the, richest, eurypterid, fossil, locations, samuel, l, mitchill, described, the, specimen, discovered, near, westmoreland, in, oneida, county, in, 1818, he, erroneously, identified, the, fossil, as, an, example, of, the, fish, silurus, likely, due, to, the, strange, catfish, like, appearance, of, the, carapace, seven, years, later, in, 1825, james, e, dekay, examined, the, fossil, and, recognized, it, as, clearly, belonging, to, an, arthropod, he, thought, the, fossil, which, he, named, eurypterus, remipes, represented, a, crustacean, of, the, order, branchiopoda, and, suggested, it, might, represent, a, missing, link, between, the, trilobites, and, more, derived, branchiopods, the, name, eurypterus, derives, from, greek, eur, s, broad, wide, and, pteron, wing, in, 1843, hermann, burmeister, published, his, view, on, trilobite, taxonomy, and, how, the, group, related, to, other, organisms, living, and, extinct, in, the, work, die, organisation, der, trilobiten, aus, ihren, lebenden, verwandten, entwickelt, he, considered, the, trilobites, to, be, crustaceans, as, previous, authors, had, and, classified, them, together, with, what, he, assumed, to, be, their, closest, relatives, eurypterus, and, the, genus, cytherina, within, a, clade, he, named, palaeadae, within, palaeadae, burmeister, erected, three, families, the, trilobitae, composed, of, all, trilobites, the, cytherinidae, composed, only, of, cytherina, an, animal, today, seen, as, an, ostracod, and, the, eurypteridae, composed, of, eurypterus, then, including, three, species, the, fourth, eurypterid, genus, to, be, described, following, hibbertopterus, in, 1836, and, campylocephalus, in, 1838, not, identified, as, eurypterids, until, later, out, of, those, still, seen, as, taxonomically, valid, in, modern, times, was, pterygotus, lit, winged, one, described, by, louis, agassiz, in, 1839, pterygotus, was, considerably, larger, in, size, than, eurypterus, and, when, the, first, fossils, were, discovered, by, quarrymen, in, scotland, they, were, referred, to, as, seraphims, by, the, workers, agassiz, first, thought, the, fossils, represented, remains, of, fish, only, recognizing, their, nature, as, arthropod, remains, five, years, later, in, 1844, in, 1849, frederick, m, coy, classified, pterygotus, together, with, eurypterus, and, belinurus, a, genus, today, seen, as, a, xiphosuran, within, burmeister, s, eurypteridae, m, coy, considered, the, eurypteridae, to, be, a, group, of, crustaceans, within, the, order, entomostraca, closely, related, to, horseshoe, crabs, a, fourth, genus, slimonia, based, on, fossil, remains, previously, assigned, to, a, new, species, of, pterygotus, was, referred, to, the, eurypteridae, in, 1856, by, david, page, jan, nieszkowski, s, de, euryptero, remipede, 1858, featured, an, extensive, description, of, eurypterus, fischeri, now, seen, as, synonymous, with, another, species, of, eurypterus, e, tetragonophthalmus, which, along, with, the, monograph, on, the, genus, pterygotus, by, thomas, henry, huxley, and, john, william, salter, and, an, exhaustive, description, of, the, various, eurypterids, of, new, york, in, volume, 3, of, the, palaeontology, of, new, york, 1859, by, james, hall, contributed, massively, to, the, understanding, of, eurypterid, diversity, and, biology, these, publications, were, the, first, to, fully, describe, the, whole, anatomy, of, eurypterids, recognizing, the, full, number, of, prosomal, appendages, and, the, number, of, preabdominal, and, postabdominal, segments, both, nieszkowski, and, hall, recognized, that, the, eurypterids, were, closely, related, to, modern, chelicerates, such, as, horseshoe, crabs, in, 1865, henry, woodward, described, the, genus, stylonurus, named, and, figured, but, not, thoroughly, described, by, david, page, in, 1856, and, raised, the, rank, of, the, eurypteridae, to, that, of, order, effectively, creating, the, eurypterida, as, the, taxonomic, unit, it, is, seen, as, today, in, the, work, anatomy, and, relations, of, the, eurypterida, 1893, malcolm, laurie, added, considerably, to, the, knowledge, and, discussion, of, eurypterid, anatomy, and, relations, he, focused, on, how, the, eurypterids, related, to, each, other, and, to, trilobites, crustaceans, scorpions, other, arachnids, and, horseshoe, crabs, the, description, of, eurypterus, fischeri, by, gerhard, holm, in, 1896, was, so, elaborate, that, the, species, became, one, of, the, most, completely, known, of, all, extinct, animals, so, much, so, that, the, knowledge, of, e, fischeri, was, comparable, with, the, knowledge, of, its, modern, relatives, such, as, the, atlantic, horseshoe, crab, the, description, also, helped, solidify, the, close, relationship, between, the, eurypterids, and, other, chelicerates, by, showcasing, numerous, homologies, between, the, two, groups, in, 1912, john, mason, clarke, and, rudolf, ruedemann, published, the, eurypterida, of, new, york, in, which, all, eurypterid, species, thus, far, recovered, from, fossil, deposits, there, were, discussed, clarke, and, ruedemann, created, one, of, the, first, phylogenetic, trees, of, eurypterids, dividing, the, order, into, two, families, eurypteridae, distinguished, by, smooth, eyes, and, including, eurypterus, anthraconectes, stylonurus, eusarcus, dolichopterus, onychopterus, and, drepanopterus, and, pterygotidae, distinguished, by, faceted, eyes, and, including, pterygotus, erettopterus, slimonia, and, hughmilleria, both, families, were, considered, to, be, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, strabops, in, line, with, earlier, authors, clarke, and, ruedemann, also, supported, a, close, relationship, between, the, eurypterids, and, the, horseshoe, crabs, united, under, the, class, merostomata, but, also, discussed, alternative, hypotheses, such, as, a, closer, relation, to, arachnids, historically, a, close, relationship, between, eurypterids, and, xiphosurans, such, as, the, modern, atlantic, horseshoe, crab, has, been, assumed, by, most, researchers, several, homologies, encourage, this, view, such, as, correlating, segments, of, the, appendages, and, the, prosoma, additionally, the, presence, of, plate, like, appendages, bearing, the, gill, tracts, on, appendages, of, the, opisthosoma, the, blattf, ssen, was, cited, early, as, an, important, homology, in, the, last, few, decades, of, the, nineteenth, century, further, homologies, were, established, such, as, the, similar, structures, of, the, compound, eyes, of, pterygotus, and, horseshoe, crabs, seen, as, especially, decisive, as, the, eye, of, the, horseshoe, crab, was, seen, as, possessing, an, almost, unique, structure, and, similarities, in, the, ontogeny, within, both, groups, these, ontogenetical, similarities, were, seen, as, most, apparent, when, studying, the, nepionic, stages, the, developmental, stage, immediately, following, the, embryonic, stage, in, both, groups, during, which, both, xiphosurans, and, eurypterids, have, a, proportionally, larger, carapace, than, adults, are, generally, broader, possess, a, distinct, ridge, down, the, middle, have, a, lesser, number, of, segments, which, lack, differentiation, and, have, an, underdeveloped, telson, due, to, these, similarities, the, xiphosurans, and, eurypterids, have, often, been, united, under, a, single, class, or, subclass, called, merostomata, erected, to, house, both, groups, by, henry, woodward, in, 1866, though, xiphosurans, like, the, eurypterids, were, historically, seen, as, crustaceans, due, to, their, respiratory, system, and, their, aquatic, lifestyle, this, hypothesis, was, discredited, after, numerous, similarities, were, discovered, between, the, horseshoe, crabs, and, the, arachnids, some, authors, such, as, john, sterling, kingsley, in, 1894, classified, the, merostomata, as, a, sister, group, to, the, arachnida, under, the, class, acerata, within, a, subphylum, branchiata, others, such, as, ray, lankester, in, 1909, went, further, and, classified, the, merostomata, as, a, subclass, within, the, arachnida, raised, to, the, rank, of, class, in, 1866, ernst, haeckel, classified, the, merostomata, containing, virtually, only, the, eurypterida, and, xiphosura, within, a, group, he, named, gigantostraca, within, the, crustaceans, though, haeckel, did, not, designate, any, taxonomic, rank, for, this, clade, it, was, interpreted, as, equivalent, to, the, rank, of, subclass, such, as, the, malacostraca, and, entomostraca, by, later, researchers, such, as, john, sterling, kinsgsley, in, subsequent, research, gigantostraca, has, been, treated, as, synonymous, with, merostomata, rarely, and, eurypterida, itself, more, commonly, a, phylogenetic, analysis, the, results, presented, in, a, cladogram, below, conducted, by, james, lamsdell, in, 2013, on, the, relationships, within, the, xiphosura, and, the, relations, to, other, closely, related, groups, including, the, eurypterids, which, were, represented, in, the, analysis, by, genera, eurypterus, parastylonurus, rhenopterus, and, stoermeropterus, concluded, that, the, xiphosura, as, presently, understood, was, paraphyletic, a, group, sharing, a, last, common, ancestor, but, not, including, all, descendants, of, this, ancestor, and, thus, not, a, valid, phylogenetic, group, eurypterids, were, recovered, as, closely, related, to, arachnids, instead, of, xiphosurans, forming, the, group, sclerophorata, within, the, clade, dekatriata, composed, of, sclerophorates, and, chasmataspidids, lamsdell, noted, that, it, is, possible, that, dekatriata, is, synonymous, with, sclerophorata, as, the, reproductive, system, the, primary, defining, feature, of, sclerophorates, has, not, been, thoroughly, studied, in, chasmataspidids, dekatriata, is, in, turn, part, of, the, prosomapoda, a, group, including, the, xiphosurida, the, only, monophyletic, xiphosuran, group, and, other, stem, genera, fuxianhuia, emeraldella, trilobitomorpha, sidneyia, yohoia, alalcomenaeus, leanchoilia, palaeoisopus, pycnogonum, haliestes, offacolus, weinbergina, venustulus, camanchia, legrandella, kasibelinurus, willwerathia, lunataspis, belinurina, limulina, pseudoniscus, cyamocephalus, pasternakevia, bunodes, limuloides, bembicosoma, chasmataspidida, arachnida, eurypterida, the, internal, classification, of, eurypterids, within, the, eurypterida, is, based, mainly, on, eleven, established, characters, these, have, been, used, throughout, the, history, of, eurypterid, research, to, establish, clades, and, genera, these, characters, include, the, shape, of, the, prosoma, the, shape, of, the, metastoma, the, shape, and, position, of, the, eyes, the, types, of, prosomal, appendages, the, types, of, swimming, leg, paddles, the, structure, of, the, doublure, the, fringe, of, the, dorsal, exoskeleton, the, structure, of, the, opithosoma, the, structure, of, the, genital, appendages, the, shape, of, the, telson, and, the, type, of, ornamentation, present, it, is, worth, noting, that, not, all, of, these, characters, are, of, equal, taxonomic, importance, they, are, not, applicable, to, all, eurypterids, either, stylonurine, eurypterids, lack, swimming, leg, paddles, entirely, some, characters, including, the, prosoma, and, metastoma, shapes, and, the, position, and, shapes, of, the, eyes, are, seen, as, important, only, for, the, distinction, between, different, genera, most, superfamilies, and, families, are, defined, based, on, the, morphology, of, the, appendages, the, most, important, character, used, in, eurypterid, taxonomy, is, the, type, of, prosomal, appendages, as, this, character, is, used, to, define, entire, suborders, general, leg, anatomy, can, also, be, used, to, define, superfamilies, and, families, historically, the, chelicerae, were, considered, the, most, important, appendages, from, a, taxonomical, standpoint, since, they, only, occurred, in, two, general, types, a, eurypterid, type, with, small, and, toothless, pincers, and, a, pterygotid, type, with, large, pincers, and, teeth, this, distinction, has, historically, been, used, to, divide, the, eurypterida, into, the, two, suborders, eurypterina, small, chelicerae, and, pterygotina, large, and, powerful, chelicerae, this, classification, scheme, is, not, without, problems, in, victor, tollerton, s, 1989, taxonomic, revision, of, the, eurypterida, with, suborders, eurypterina, and, pterygotina, recognized, several, clades, of, eurypterids, today, recognized, as, stylonurines, including, hibbertopterids, and, mycteroptids, were, reclassified, as, non, eurypterids, in, the, new, separate, order, cyrtoctenida, on, the, grounds, of, perceived, inconsistencies, in, the, prosomal, appendages, modern, research, favors, a, classification, into, suborders, eurypterina, and, stylonurina, instead, supported, by, phylogenetic, analyses, in, particular, pterygotid, eurypterids, share, a, number, of, homologies, with, derived, eurypterine, eurypterids, such, as, the, adelophthalmids, and, are, thus, best, classified, as, derived, members, of, the, same, suborder, in, the, stylonurina, the, sixth, pair, of, appendages, is, represented, by, long, and, slender, walking, legs, and, lack, a, modified, spine, referred, to, as, the, podomere, 7a, in, most, eurypterids, in, the, eurypterina, the, sixth, pair, of, appendages, is, broadened, into, swimming, paddles, and, always, has, a, podomere, 7a, 75, of, eurypterid, species, are, eurypterines, and, they, represent, 99, of, all, fossil, eurypterid, specimens, of, all, eurypterid, clades, the, pterygotioidea, is, the, most, species, rich, with, over, 50, species, the, second, most, species, rich, clade, is, the, adelophthalmoidea, with, over, 40, species, the, cladogram, presented, below, covering, all, currently, recognized, eurypterid, families, follows, a, 2007, study, by, o, erik, tetlie, the, stylonurine, suborder, follows, a, 2010, study, by, james, lamsdell, simon, j, braddy, and, tetlie, the, superfamily, megalograptoidea, recognized, by, tetlie, in, 2007, and, then, placed, between, the, onychopterelloidea, and, eurypteroidea, has, been, omitted, as, more, recent, studies, suggest, that, the, megalograptids, were, members, of, the, superfamily, carcinosomatoidea, as,
