the, bonobo, b, n, o, b, o, b, n, b, o, pan, paniscus, also, historically, called, the, pygmy, chimpanzee, less, often, the, dwarf, chimpanzee, or, gracile, chimpanzee, is, an, endangered, great, ape, and, one, of, the, two, species, making, up, the, genus, pan, the, other, being, the, common, chimpanzee, pan, troglodytes, while, bonobos, are, today, recognized, as, a, distinct, species, in, their, own, right, they, were, initially, thought, to, be, a, subspecies, of, pan, troglodytes, due, to, the, physical, similarities, between, the, two, species, taxonomically, members, of, the, chimpanzee, bonobo, subtribe, panina, composed, entirely, by, the, genus, pan, are, collectively, termed, panins, bonobos, are, distinguished, from, common, chimpanzees, by, relatively, long, limbs, pinker, lips, a, darker, face, a, tail, tuft, through, adulthood, and, parted, longer, hair, on, their, heads, some, individuals, have, sparser, thin, hair, over, parts, of, their, bodies, the, bonobo, is, found, in, a, 500, 000, km, 2, 190, 000, sq, mi, area, within, the, congo, basin, of, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, drc, central, africa, it, is, predominantly, frugivorous, compared, to, the, often, highly, omnivorous, diets, and, hunting, of, small, monkeys, duiker, and, other, antelope, exhibited, by, common, chimpanzees, bonobos, inhabit, primary, and, secondary, forest, including, seasonally, inundated, swamp, forest, because, of, political, instability, in, the, region, and, the, general, timidity, of, bonobos, there, has, been, relatively, little, field, work, done, observing, the, species, in, its, natural, habitat, according, to, studies, published, in, 2017, by, researchers, at, the, george, washington, university, the, ancestors, of, the, genus, pan, split, from, the, human, line, about, 8, million, years, ago, moreover, bonobos, split, from, the, common, chimpanzee, line, about, 2, million, years, ago, along, with, the, common, chimpanzee, the, bonobo, is, the, closest, extant, relative, to, humans, as, the, two, species, are, not, proficient, swimmers, the, natural, formation, of, the, congo, river, around, 1, 5, 2, million, years, ago, possibly, led, to, the, isolation, and, speciation, of, the, bonobo, bonobos, live, south, of, the, river, and, thereby, were, separated, from, the, ancestors, of, the, common, chimpanzee, which, live, north, of, the, river, there, are, no, concrete, figures, regarding, population, but, the, estimate, is, between, 29, 500, and, 50, 000, individuals, the, species, is, listed, as, endangered, on, the, iucn, red, list, and, is, most, threatened, by, habitat, destruction, human, population, growth, and, movement, as, well, as, ongoing, civil, unrest, and, political, infighting, with, commercial, poaching, being, by, far, the, most, prominent, threat, bonobos, typically, live, 40, years, in, captivity, their, lifespan, in, the, wild, is, unknown, but, it, is, almost, certainly, much, shorter, formerly, the, bonobo, was, known, as, the, pygmy, chimpanzee, despite, the, bonobo, having, a, similar, body, size, to, the, common, chimpanzee, the, name, pygmy, was, given, by, the, german, zoologist, ernst, schwarz, in, 1929, who, classified, the, species, on, the, basis, of, a, previously, mislabeled, bonobo, cranium, noting, its, diminutive, size, compared, to, chimpanzee, skulls, the, name, bonobo, first, appeared, in, 1954, when, austrian, zoologist, eduard, paul, tratz, and, german, biologist, heinz, heck, proposed, it, as, a, new, and, separate, generic, term, for, pygmy, chimpanzees, the, name, is, thought, to, derive, from, a, misspelling, on, a, shipping, crate, from, the, town, of, bolobo, on, the, congo, river, near, the, location, from, which, the, first, bonobo, specimens, were, collected, in, the, 1920s, the, bonobo, was, first, recognised, as, a, distinct, taxon, in, 1928, by, german, anatomist, ernst, schwarz, based, on, a, skull, in, the, tervuren, museum, in, belgium, which, had, previously, been, classified, as, a, juvenile, chimpanzee, pan, troglodytes, schwarz, published, his, findings, in, 1929, classifying, the, bonobo, as, a, subspecies, of, chimpanzee, pan, satyrus, paniscus, in, 1933, american, anatomist, harold, coolidge, elevated, it, to, species, status, major, behavioural, differences, between, bonobos, and, chimpanzees, were, first, discussed, in, detail, by, tratz, and, heck, in, the, early, 1950s, unaware, of, any, taxonomic, distinction, with, the, common, chimpanzee, american, psychologist, and, primatologist, robert, yerkes, had, already, noticed, an, unexpected, major, behavioural, difference, in, the, 1920s, bonobos, and, chimpanzees, are, the, two, species, which, make, up, the, genus, pan, and, are, the, closest, living, relatives, to, humans, homo, sapiens, according, to, studies, published, in, 2017, by, researchers, at, the, george, washington, university, bonobos, along, with, common, chimpanzees, split, from, the, human, line, about, 8, million, years, ago, moreover, bonobos, split, from, the, common, chimpanzee, line, about, 2, million, years, ago, nonetheless, the, exact, timing, of, the, pan, homo, last, common, ancestor, is, contentious, but, dna, comparison, suggests, continual, interbreeding, between, ancestral, pan, and, homo, groups, post, divergence, until, about, 4, million, years, ago, dna, evidence, suggests, the, bonobo, and, common, chimpanzee, species, diverged, approximately, 890, 000, 860, 000, years, ago, due, to, separation, of, these, two, populations, possibly, due, to, acidification, and, the, spread, of, savannas, at, this, time, currently, these, two, species, are, separated, by, the, congo, river, which, had, existed, well, before, the, divergence, date, though, ancestral, pan, may, have, dispersed, across, the, river, using, corridors, which, no, longer, exist, the, first, pan, fossils, were, reported, in, 2005, from, the, middle, pleistocene, after, the, bonobo, chimpanzee, split, of, kenya, alongside, early, homo, fossils, according, to, a, zihlman, bonobo, body, proportions, closely, resemble, those, of, australopithecus, leading, evolutionary, biologist, jeremy, griffith, to, suggest, that, bonobos, may, be, a, living, example, of, our, distant, human, ancestors, according, to, australian, anthropologists, gary, clark, and, maciej, henneberg, human, ancestors, went, through, a, bonobo, like, phase, featuring, reduced, aggression, and, associated, anatomical, changes, exemplified, in, ardipithecus, ramidus, the, first, official, publication, of, the, sequencing, and, assembly, of, the, bonobo, genome, was, released, in, june, 2012, the, genome, of, a, female, bonobo, from, leipzig, zoo, was, deposited, with, the, international, nucleotide, sequence, database, collaboration, ddbj, embl, genbank, under, the, embl, accession, number, ajfe01000000, after, a, previous, analysis, by, the, national, human, genome, research, institute, confirmed, that, the, bonobo, genome, is, about, 0, 4, divergent, from, the, chimpanzee, genome, relationships, of, bonobos, to, humans, and, other, apes, can, be, determined, by, comparing, their, genes, or, whole, genomes, while, the, first, bonobo, genome, was, published, in, 2012, a, high, quality, reference, genome, became, available, only, in, 2021, the, overall, nucleotide, divergence, between, chimpanzee, and, bonobo, based, on, the, latter, is, 0, 421, 0, 086, for, autosomes, and, 0, 311, 0, 060, for, the, x, chromosome, the, reference, genome, predicts, 22, 366, full, length, protein, coding, genes, and, 9, 066, noncoding, genes, although, cdna, sequencing, confirmed, only, 20, 478, protein, coding, and, 36, 880, noncoding, bonobo, genes, similar, to, the, number, of, genes, annotated, in, the, human, genome, overall, 206, and, 1, 576, protein, coding, genes, are, part, of, gene, families, that, contracted, or, expanded, in, the, bonobo, genome, compared, to, the, human, genome, respectively, that, is, these, genes, were, lost, or, gained, in, the, bonobo, genome, compared, to, humans, researchers, have, found, that, both, central, pan, troglodytes, troglodytes, and, eastern, chimpanzees, pan, troglodytes, schweinfurthii, share, more, genetic, material, with, bonobos, than, other, chimpanzee, subspecies, it, is, believed, that, genetic, admixture, has, occurred, at, least, two, times, within, the, past, 550, 000, years, in, modern, times, hybridization, between, bonobos, and, chimpanzees, in, the, wild, is, prevented, as, populations, are, allopatric, and, kept, isolated, on, different, sides, of, the, congo, river, within, captivity, hybrids, between, bonobos, and, chimpanzees, have, been, recorded, between, 1990, and, 1992, five, pregnancies, were, conceived, and, studied, between, a, male, bonobo, and, two, female, chimpanzees, the, two, initial, pregnancies, were, aborted, due, to, environmental, stressors, the, following, three, pregnancies, however, led, to, the, birth, of, three, hybrid, offspring, a, bonobo, and, chimpanzee, hybrid, called, tiby, was, also, featured, in, the, 2017, swedish, film, the, square, the, bonobo, is, commonly, considered, to, be, more, gracile, than, the, common, chimpanzee, although, large, male, chimpanzees, can, exceed, any, bonobo, in, bulk, and, weight, the, two, species, broadly, overlap, in, body, size, adult, female, bonobos, are, somewhat, smaller, than, adult, males, body, mass, ranges, from, 34, to, 60, kg, 75, to, 132, lb, with, an, average, weight, of, 45, kilograms, 99, lb, in, males, against, an, average, of, 33, kg, 73, lb, in, females, the, total, length, of, bonobos, from, the, nose, to, the, rump, while, on, all, fours, is, 70, to, 83, cm, 28, to, 33, in, male, bonobos, average, 119, cm, 3, 90, ft, when, standing, upright, compared, to, 111, centimetres, 3, 64, ft, in, females, the, bonobo, s, head, is, relatively, smaller, than, that, of, the, common, chimpanzee, with, less, prominent, brow, ridges, above, the, eyes, it, has, a, black, face, with, pink, lips, small, ears, wide, nostrils, and, long, hair, on, its, head, that, forms, a, parting, females, have, slightly, more, prominent, breasts, in, contrast, to, the, flat, breasts, of, other, female, apes, although, not, so, prominent, as, those, of, humans, the, bonobo, also, has, a, slim, upper, body, narrow, shoulders, thin, neck, and, long, legs, when, compared, to, the, common, chimpanzee, bonobos, are, both, terrestrial, and, arboreal, most, ground, locomotion, is, characterized, by, quadrupedal, knuckle, walking, bipedal, walking, has, been, recorded, as, less, than, 1, of, terrestrial, locomotion, in, the, wild, a, figure, that, decreased, with, habituation, while, in, captivity, there, is, a, wide, variation, bipedal, walking, in, captivity, as, a, percentage, of, bipedal, plus, quadrupedal, locomotion, bouts, has, been, observed, from, 3, 9, for, spontaneous, bouts, to, nearly, 19, when, abundant, food, is, provided, these, physical, characteristics, and, its, posture, give, the, bonobo, an, appearance, more, closely, resembling, that, of, humans, than, the, common, chimpanzee, does, the, bonobo, also, has, highly, individuated, facial, features, as, humans, do, so, that, one, individual, may, look, significantly, different, from, another, a, characteristic, adapted, for, visual, facial, recognition, in, social, interaction, multivariate, analysis, has, shown, bonobos, are, more, neotenized, than, the, common, chimpanzee, taking, into, account, such, features, as, the, proportionately, long, torso, length, of, the, bonobo, other, researchers, challenged, this, conclusion, primatologist, frans, de, waal, states, bonobos, are, capable, of, altruism, compassion, empathy, kindness, patience, and, sensitivity, and, described, bonobo, society, as, a, gynecocracy, primatologists, who, have, studied, bonobos, in, the, wild, have, documented, a, wide, range, of, behaviors, including, aggressive, behavior, and, more, cyclic, sexual, behavior, similar, to, chimpanzees, even, though, bonobos, show, more, sexual, behavior, in, a, greater, variety, of, relationships, an, analysis, of, female, bonding, among, wild, bonobos, by, takeshi, furuichi, stresses, female, sexuality, and, shows, how, female, bonobos, spend, much, more, time, in, estrus, than, female, chimpanzees, some, primatologists, have, argued, that, de, waal, s, data, reflect, only, the, behavior, of, captive, bonobos, suggesting, that, wild, bonobos, show, levels, of, aggression, closer, to, what, is, found, among, chimpanzees, de, waal, has, responded, that, the, contrast, in, temperament, between, bonobos, and, chimpanzees, observed, in, captivity, is, meaningful, because, it, controls, for, the, influence, of, environment, the, two, species, behave, quite, differently, even, if, kept, under, identical, conditions, a, 2014, study, also, found, bonobos, to, be, less, aggressive, than, chimpanzees, particularly, eastern, chimpanzees, the, authors, argued, that, the, relative, peacefulness, of, western, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, was, primarily, due, to, ecological, factors, bonobos, warn, each, other, of, danger, less, efficiently, than, chimpanzees, in, the, same, situation, nonetheless, on, 12, april, 2024, biologists, reported, that, bonobos, behave, more, aggressively, than, thought, earlier, bonobos, are, unusual, among, apes, for, their, matriarchal, social, structure, extensive, overlap, between, the, male, and, female, hierarchies, leads, some, to, refer, to, them, as, gender, balanced, in, their, power, structure, bonobos, do, not, have, a, defined, territory, and, communities, will, travel, over, a, wide, range, due, to, the, nomadic, nature, of, the, females, and, evenly, distributed, food, in, their, environment, males, do, not, gain, any, obvious, advantages, by, forming, alliances, with, other, males, or, by, defending, a, home, range, as, chimpanzees, do, female, bonobos, possess, sharper, canines, than, female, chimpanzees, further, fueling, their, status, in, the, group, although, a, male, bonobo, is, dominant, to, a, female, in, a, dyadic, interaction, depending, on, the, community, socially, bonded, females, may, be, co, dominant, with, males, or, dominant, over, them, even, to, the, extent, that, females, can, coerce, reluctant, males, into, mating, with, them, at, the, top, of, the, hierarchy, is, a, coalition, of, high, ranking, females, and, males, typically, headed, by, an, old, experienced, matriarch, who, acts, as, the, decision, maker, and, leader, of, the, group, female, bonobos, typically, earn, their, rank, through, experience, age, and, ability, to, forge, alliances, with, other, females, in, their, group, rather, than, physical, intimidation, and, top, ranking, females, will, protect, immigrant, females, from, male, harassment, while, bonobos, are, often, called, matriarchal, and, while, every, community, is, dominated, by, a, female, some, males, will, still, obtain, a, high, rank, and, act, as, coalitionary, partners, to, the, alpha, female, often, taking, initiative, in, coordinating, the, groups, movements, these, males, may, outrank, not, only, the, other, males, in, the, group, but, also, many, females, certain, males, alert, the, group, to, any, possible, threats, protecting, the, group, from, predators, such, as, pythons, and, leopards, aggressive, encounters, between, males, and, females, are, rare, and, males, are, tolerant, of, infants, and, juveniles, a, male, derives, his, status, from, the, status, of, his, mother, the, mother, son, bond, often, stays, strong, and, continues, throughout, life, while, social, hierarchies, do, exist, and, although, the, son, of, a, high, ranking, female, may, outrank, a, lower, female, rank, plays, a, less, prominent, role, than, in, other, primate, societies, relationships, between, different, communities, are, often, positive, and, affiliative, and, bonobos, are, not, a, territorial, species, bonobos, will, also, share, food, with, others, even, unrelated, strangers, bonobos, exhibit, paedomorphism, retaining, infantile, physical, characteristics, and, behaviours, which, greatly, inhibits, aggression, and, enables, unfamiliar, bonobos, to, freely, mingle, and, cooperate, with, each, other, males, engage, in, lengthy, friendships, with, females, and, in, turn, female, bonobos, prefer, to, associate, with, and, mate, with, males, who, are, respectful, and, easygoing, around, them, because, female, bonobos, can, use, alliances, to, rebuff, coercive, and, domineering, males, and, select, males, at, their, own, leisure, they, show, preference, for, males, who, are, not, aggressive, towards, them, aging, bonobos, lose, their, playful, streak, and, become, noticeably, more, irritable, in, old, age, both, sexes, have, a, similar, level, of, aggressiveness, bonobos, live, in, a, male, philopatric, society, where, the, females, immigrate, to, new, communities, while, males, remain, in, their, natal, troop, however, it, is, not, entirely, unheard, of, for, males, to, occasionally, transfer, into, new, groups, additionally, females, with, powerful, mothers, may, remain, in, their, natal, clan, alliances, between, males, are, poorly, developed, in, most, bonobo, communities, while, females, will, form, alliances, with, each, other, and, alliances, between, males, and, females, occur, including, multisex, hunting, parties, there, is, a, confirmed, case, of, a, grown, male, bonobo, adopting, his, orphaned, infant, brother, a, mother, bonobo, will, also, support, her, grown, son, in, conflicts, with, other, males, and, help, him, secure, better, ties, with, other, females, enhancing, her, chance, of, gaining, grandchildren, from, him, she, will, even, take, measures, such, as, physical, intervention, to, prevent, other, males, from, breeding, with, certain, females, she, wants, her, son, to, mate, with, although, mothers, play, a, role, in, aiding, their, sons, and, the, hierarchy, among, males, is, largely, reflected, by, their, mother, s, social, status, some, motherless, males, will, still, successfully, dominate, some, males, who, do, have, mothers, female, bonobos, have, also, been, observed, fostering, infants, from, outside, their, established, community, bonobos, are, not, known, to, kill, each, other, and, are, generally, less, violent, than, chimpanzees, yet, aggression, still, manifests, itself, in, this, species, although, female, bonobos, dominate, males, and, selectively, mate, with, males, who, do, not, exhibit, aggression, toward, them, competition, between, the, males, themselves, is, intense, and, high, ranking, males, secure, more, matings, than, low, ranking, ones, indeed, the, size, difference, between, males, and, females, is, more, pronounced, in, bonobos, than, it, is, in, chimpanzees, as, male, bonobos, do, not, form, alliances, and, therefore, have, little, incentive, to, hold, back, when, fighting, for, access, to, females, male, bonobos, are, known, to, attack, each, other, and, inflict, serious, injuries, such, as, missing, digits, damaged, eyes, and, torn, ears, some, of, these, injuries, may, also, occur, when, a, male, threatens, the, high, ranking, females, and, is, injured, by, them, as, the, larger, male, is, swarmed, and, outnumbered, by, a, female, mob, due, to, the, promiscuous, mating, behavior, of, female, bonobos, a, male, cannot, be, sure, which, offspring, are, his, as, a, result, the, entirety, of, parental, care, in, bonobos, is, assumed, by, the, mothers, however, bonobos, are, not, as, promiscuous, as, chimpanzees, and, slightly, polygamous, tendencies, occur, with, high, ranking, males, enjoying, greater, reproductive, success, than, low, ranking, males, unlike, chimpanzees, where, any, male, can, coerce, a, female, into, mating, with, him, female, bonobos, enjoy, greater, sexual, preferences, and, can, rebuff, undesirable, males, an, advantage, of, female, female, bonding, and, actively, seek, out, higher, ranking, males, bonobo, party, size, tends, to, vary, because, the, groups, exhibit, a, fission, fusion, pattern, a, community, of, approximately, 100, will, split, into, small, groups, during, the, day, while, looking, for, food, and, then, will, come, back, together, to, sleep, they, sleep, in, nests, that, they, construct, in, trees, female, bonobos, more, often, than, not, secure, feeding, privileges, and, feed, before, males, do, although, they, are, rarely, successful, in, one, on, one, confrontations, with, males, a, female, bonobo, with, several, allies, supporting, her, has, extremely, high, success, in, monopolizing, food, sources, different, communities, favour, different, prey, in, some, communities, females, exclusively, hunt, and, have, a, preference, for, rodents, in, others, both, sexes, hunt, and, will, target, monkeys, in, captive, settings, females, exhibit, extreme, food, based, aggression, towards, males, and, forge, coalitions, against, them, to, monopolize, specific, food, items, often, going, as, far, as, to, mutilate, any, males, who, fail, to, heed, their, warning, in, wild, settings, however, female, bonobos, will, quietly, ask, males, for, food, if, they, had, gotten, it, first, instead, of, forcibly, confiscating, it, suggesting, sex, based, hierarchy, roles, are, less, rigid, than, in, captive, colonies, female, bonobos, are, known, to, lead, hunts, on, duikers, and, successfully, defend, their, bounty, from, marauding, males, in, the, wild, they, are, more, tolerant, of, younger, males, pestering, them, yet, exhibit, heightened, aggression, towards, older, males, in, a, study, published, in, november, 2023, scientists, reported, for, the, first, time, evidence, that, groups, of, primates, particularly, bonobos, are, capable, of, cooperating, with, each, other, researchers, observed, unprecedented, cooperation, between, two, distinct, bonobo, groups, in, the, congo, s, kokolopori, bonobo, reserve, ekalakala, and, kokoalongo, challenging, traditional, notions, of, ape, societies, over, two, years, of, observation, researchers, witnessed, 95, encounters, between, the, groups, contrary, to, expectations, these, interactions, resembled, those, within, a, single, group, during, these, encounters, the, bonobos, engaged, in, behaviors, such, as, grooming, food, sharing, and, collective, defense, against, threats, like, snakes, notably, the, two, groups, while, displaying, cooperative, tendencies, maintained, distinct, identities, and, there, was, no, evidence, of, interbreeding, or, a, blending, of, cultures, the, cooperation, observed, was, not, arbitrary, but, evolved, through, individual, bonds, formed, by, exchanging, favors, and, gifts, some, bonobos, even, formed, alliances, to, target, a, third, individual, demonstrating, a, nuanced, social, dynamic, within, the, groups, sexual, activity, generally, plays, a, major, role, in, bonobo, society, being, used, as, what, some, scientists, perceive, as, a, greeting, a, means, of, forming, social, bonds, a, means, of, conflict, resolution, and, postconflict, reconciliation, bonobos, are, the, only, non, human, animal, to, have, been, observed, engaging, in, tongue, kissing, bonobos, and, humans, are, the, only, primates, to, typically, engage, in, face, to, face, genital, sex, although, a, pair, of, western, gorillas, has, also, been, photographed, in, this, position, bonobos, do, not, form, permanent, monogamous, sexual, relationships, with, individual, partners, they, also, do, not, seem, to, discriminate, in, their, sexual, behavior, by, sex, or, age, with, the, possible, exception, of, abstaining, from, sexual, activity, between, mothers, and, their, adult, sons, when, bonobos, come, upon, a, new, food, source, or, feeding, ground, the, increased, excitement, will, usually, lead, to, communal, sexual, activity, presumably, decreasing, tension, and, encouraging, peaceful, feeding, more, often, than, the, males, female, bonobos, engage, in, mutual, genital, rubbing, behavior, possibly, to, bond, socially, with, each, other, thus, forming, a, female, nucleus, of, bonobo, society, the, bonding, among, females, enables, them, to, dominate, most, of, the, males, adolescent, females, often, leave, their, native, community, to, join, another, community, this, migration, mixes, the, bonobo, gene, pools, providing, genetic, diversity, sexual, bonding, with, other, females, establishes, these, new, females, as, members, of, the, group, bonobo, clitorises, are, larger, and, more, externalized, than, in, most, mammals, while, the, weight, of, a, young, adolescent, female, bonobo, is, maybe, half, that, of, a, human, teenager, she, has, a, clitoris, that, is, three, times, bigger, than, the, human, equivalent, and, visible, enough, to, waggle, unmistakably, as, she, walks, in, scientific, literature, the, female, female, behavior, of, bonobos, pressing, vulvas, together, is, often, referred, to, as, genito, genital, gg, rubbing, this, sexual, activity, happens, within, the, immediate, female, bonobo, community, and, sometimes, outside, of, it, ethologist, jonathan, balcombe, stated, that, female, bonobos, rub, their, clitorises, together, rapidly, for, ten, to, twenty, seconds, and, this, behavior, which, may, be, repeated, in, rapid, succession, is, usually, accompanied, by, grinding, shrieking, and, clitoral, engorgement, he, added, that, it, is, estimated, that, they, engage, in, this, practice, about, once, every, two, hours, on, average, as, bonobos, occasionally, copulate, face, to, face, evolutionary, biologist, marlene, zuk, has, suggested, that, the, position, of, the, clitoris, in, bonobos, and, some, other, primates, has, evolved, to, maximize, stimulation, during, sexual, intercourse, the, position, of, the, clitoris, may, alternatively, permit, gg, rubbings, which, has, been, hypothesized, to, function, as, a, means, for, female, bonobos, to, evaluate, their, intrasocial, relationships, bonobo, males, engage, in, various, forms, of, male, male, genital, behavior, the, most, common, form, of, male, male, mounting, is, similar, to, that, of, a, heterosexual, mounting, one, of, the, males, sits, passively, on, his, back, the, other, male, thrusting, on, him, with, the, penises, rubbing, together, due, to, both, males, erections, in, another, rarer, form, of, genital, rubbing, two, bonobo, males, hang, from, a, tree, limb, face, to, face, while, penis, fencing, this, also, may, occur, when, two, males, rub, their, penises, together, while, in, face, to, face, position, another, form, of, genital, interaction, rump, rubbing, often, occurs, to, express, reconciliation, between, two, males, after, a, conflict, when, they, stand, back, to, back, and, rub, their, scrotal, sacs, together, but, such, behavior, also, occurs, outside, agonistic, contexts, kitamura, 1989, observed, rump, rump, contacts, between, adult, males, following, sexual, solicitation, behaviors, similar, to, those, between, female, bonobos, prior, to, gg, rubbing, takayoshi, kano, observed, similar, practices, among, bonobos, in, the, natural, habitat, tongue, kissing, oral, sex, and, genital, massaging, have, also, been, recorded, among, male, bonobos, wild, females, give, birth, for, the, first, time, at, 13, or, 14, years, of, age, bonobo, reproductive, rates, are, no, higher, than, those, of, the, common, chimpanzee, however, female, bonobo, oestrus, periods, are, longer, during, oestrus, females, undergo, a, swelling, of, the, perineal, tissue, lasting, 10, to, 20, days, the, gestation, period, is, on, average, 240, days, postpartum, amenorrhea, absence, of, menstruation, lasts, less, than, one, year, and, a, female, may, resume, external, signs, of, oestrus, within, a, year, of, giving, birth, though, the, female, is, probably, not, fertile, at, this, point, female, bonobos, carry, and, nurse, their, young, for, four, years, and, give, birth, on, average, every, 4, 6, years, compared, to, common, chimpanzees, bonobo, females, resume, the, genital, swelling, cycle, much, sooner, after, giving, birth, enabling, them, to, rejoin, the, sexual, activities, of, their, society, also, bonobo, females, which, are, sterile, or, too, young, to, reproduce, still, engage, in, sexual, activity, mothers, will, help, their, sons, get, more, matings, from, females, in, oestrus, adult, male, bonobos, have, sex, with, infants, although, without, penetration, adult, females, also, have, sex, with, infants, but, less, frequently, infants, are, not, passive, participants, they, quite, often, initiate, contacts, with, both, adult, males, and, females, as, well, as, with, peers, they, have, also, been, shown, to, be, sexually, active, even, in, the, absence, of, any, stimulation, or, learning, from, adults, infanticide, while, well, documented, in, chimpanzees, is, apparently, absent, in, bonobo, society, although, infanticide, has, not, been, directly, observed, there, have, been, documented, cases, of, both, female, and, male, bonobos, kidnapping, infants, sometimes, resulting, in, infants, dying, from, dehydration, although, male, bonobos, have, not, yet, been, seen, to, practice, infanticide, there, is, a, documented, incident, in, captivity, involving, a, dominant, female, abducting, an, infant, from, a, lower, ranking, female, treating, the, infant, roughly, and, denying, it, the, chance, to, suckle, during, the, kidnapping, the, infant, s, mother, was, clearly, distressed, and, tried, to, retrieve, her, infant, had, the, zookeepers, not, intervened, the, infant, almost, certainly, would, have, died, from, dehydration, this, suggests, female, bonobos, can, have, hostile, rivalries, with, each, other, and, a, propensity, to, carry, out, infanticide, the, highly, sexual, nature, of, bonobo, society, and, the, fact, that, there, is, little, competition, over, mates, means, that, many, males, and, females, are, mating, with, each, other, in, contrast, to, the, one, dominant, male, chimpanzee, that, fathers, most, of, the, offspring, in, a, group, the, strategy, of, bonobo, females, mating, with, many, males, may, be, a, counterstrategy, to, infanticide, because, it, confuses, paternity, if, male, bonobos, cannot, distinguish, their, own, offspring, from, others, the, incentive, for, infanticide, essentially, disappears, this, is, a, reproductive, strategy, that, seems, specific, to, bonobos, infanticide, is, observed, in, all, other, great, apes, except, orangutans, bonobos, engage, in, sexual, activity, numerous, times, a, day, it, is, unknown, how, the, bonobo, avoids, simian, immunodeficiency, virus, siv, and, its, effects, observations, in, the, wild, indicate, that, the, males, among, the, related, common, chimpanzee, communities, are, hostile, to, males, from, outside, the, community, parties, of, males, patrol, for, the, neighboring, males, that, might, be, traveling, alone, and, attack, those, single, males, often, killing, them, this, does, not, appear, to, be, the, behavior, of, bonobo, males, or, females, which, seem, to, prefer, sexual, contact, over, violent, confrontation, with, outsiders, while, bonobos, are, more, peaceful, than, chimpanzees, it, is, not, true, that, they, are, unaggressive, in, the, wild, among, males, bonobos, are, half, as, aggressive, as, chimpanzees, while, female, bonobos, are, more, aggressive, than, female, chimpanzees, both, bonobos, and, chimpanzees, exhibit, physical, aggression, more, than, 100, times, as, often, as, humans, do, although, referred, to, as, peaceful, bonobo, aggression, is, not, restricted, to, each, other, and, humans, have, also, been, attacked, by, bonobos, and, suffered, serious, albeit, non, fatal, injuries, bonobos, are, far, less, violent, than, chimpanzees, though, as, lethal, aggression, is, essentially, nonexistent, among, bonobos, while, being, not, infrequent, among, chimpanzees, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, bonobos, are, able, to, live, a, more, peaceful, lifestyle, in, part, because, of, an, abundance, of, nutritious, vegetation, in, their, natural, habitat, allowing, them, to, travel, and, forage, in, large, parties, recent, studies, show, that, there, are, significant, brain, differences, between, bonobos, and, chimpanzees, bonobos, have, more, grey, matter, volume, in, the, right, anterior, insula, right, dorsal, amygdala, hypothalamus, and, right, dorsomedial, prefrontal, cortex, all, of, which, are, regions, assumed, to, be, vital, for, feeling, empathy, sensing, distress, in, others, and, feeling, anxiety, they, also, have, a, thick, connection, between, the, amygdala, an, important, area, that, can, spark, aggression, and, the, ventral, anterior, cingulate, cortex, which, has, been, shown, to, help, control, impulses, in, humans, this, thicker, connection, may, make, them, better, at, regulating, their, emotional, impulses, and, behavior, bonobo, society, is, dominated, by, females, and, severing, the, lifelong, alliance, between, mothers, and, their, male, offspring, may, make, them, vulnerable, to, female, aggression, de, waal, has, warned, of, the, danger, of, romanticizing, bonobos, all, animals, are, competitive, by, nature, and, cooperative, only, under, specific, circumstances, and, that, when, first, writing, about, their, behaviour, i, spoke, of, sex, for, peace, precisely, because, bonobos, had, plenty, of, conflicts, there, would, obviously, be, no, need, for, peacemaking, if, they, lived, in, perfect, harmony, surbeck, and, hohmann, showed, in, 2008, that, bonobos, sometimes, do, hunt, monkey, species, five, incidents, were, observed, in, a, group, of, bonobos, in, salonga, national, park, which, seemed, to, reflect, deliberate, cooperative, hunting, on, three, occasions, the, hunt, was, successful, and, infant, monkeys, were, captured, and, eaten, there, is, one, inferred, intraspecies, killing, in, the, wild, and, a, confirmed, lethal, attack, in, captivity, in, both, cases, the, attackers, were, female, and, the, victims, were, male, the, bonobo, is, an, omnivorous, frugivore, 57, of, its, diet, is, fruit, but, this, is, supplemented, with, leaves, honey, eggs, meat, from, small, vertebrates, such, as, anomalures, flying, squirrels, and, duikers, and, invertebrates, the, truffle, species, hysterangium, bonobo, is, eaten, by, bonobos, in, some, instances, bonobos, have, been, shown, to, consume, lower, order, primates, some, claim, bonobos, have, also, been, known, to, practise, cannibalism, in, captivity, a, claim, disputed, by, others, however, at, least, one, confirmed, report, of, cannibalism, in, the, wild, of, a, dead, infant, was, described, in, 2008, a, 2016, paper, reported, two, more, instances, of, infant, cannibalism, although, it, was, not, confirmed, if, infanticide, was, involved, in, 2020, the, first, whole, genome, comparison, between, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, was, published, and, showed, genomic, aspects, that, may, underlie, or, have, resulted, from, their, divergence, and, behavioral, differences, including, selection, for, genes, related, to, diet, and, hormones, a, 2010, study, found, that, female, bonobos, displayed, a, larger, range, of, tool, use, behaviours, than, males, a, pattern, previously, described, for, chimpanzees, but, not, for, other, great, apes, this, finding, was, affirmed, by, the, results, of, another, 2010, study, which, also, found, that, bonobos, were, more, skilled, at, solving, tasks, related, to, theory, of, mind, or, an, understanding, of, social, causality, while, chimpanzees, were, more, skilled, at, tasks, requiring, the, use, of, tools, and, an, understanding, of, physical, causality, bonobos, have, been, found, to, be, more, risk, averse, compared, to, chimpanzees, preferring, immediate, rather, than, delayed, rewards, when, it, comes, to, foraging, bonobos, also, have, a, weaker, spatial, memory, compared, to, chimpanzees, with, adult, bonobos, performing, comparably, to, juvenile, chimpanzees, bonobos, are, capable, of, passing, the, mirror, recognition, test, for, self, awareness, as, are, all, great, apes, they, communicate, primarily, through, vocal, means, although, the, meanings, of, their, vocalizations, are, not, currently, known, however, most, humans, do, understand, their, facial, expressions, and, some, of, their, natural, hand, gestures, such, as, their, invitation, to, play, the, communication, system, of, wild, bonobos, includes, a, characteristic, that, was, earlier, only, known, in, humans, bonobos, use, the, same, call, to, mean, different, things, in, different, situations, and, the, other, bonobos, have, to, take, the, context, into, account, when, determining, the, meaning, two, bonobos, at, the, great, ape, trust, kanzi, and, panbanisha, have, been, taught, how, to, communicate, using, a, keyboard, labeled, with, lexigrams, geometric, symbols, and, they, can, respond, to, spoken, sentences, kanzi, s, vocabulary, consists, of, more, than, 500, english, words, and, he, has, comprehension, of, around, 3, 000, spoken, english, words, kanzi, is, also, known, for, learning, by, observing, people, trying, to, teach, his, mother, kanzi, started, doing, the, tasks, that, his, mother, was, taught, just, by, watching, some, of, which, his, mother, had, failed, to, learn, some, such, as, philosopher, and, bioethicist, peter, singer, argue, that, these, results, qualify, them, for, rights, to, survival, and, life, rights, which, humans, theoretically, accord, to, all, persons, see, great, ape, personhood, in, the, 1990s, kanzi, was, taught, to, make, and, use, simple, stone, tools, this, resulted, from, a, study, undertaken, by, researchers, kathy, schick, and, nicholas, toth, and, later, gary, garufi, the, researchers, wanted, to, know, if, kanzi, possessed, the, cognitive, and, biomechanical, abilities, required, to, make, and, use, stone, tools, though, kanzi, was, able, to, form, flakes, he, did, not, create, them, in, the, same, way, as, humans, who, hold, the, core, in, one, hand, and, knap, it, with, the, other, kanzi, threw, the, cobble, against, a, hard, surface, or, against, another, cobble, this, allowed, him, to, produce, a, larger, force, to, initiate, a, fracture, as, opposed, to, knapping, it, in, his, hands, as, in, other, great, apes, and, humans, third, party, affiliation, toward, the, victim, the, affinitive, contact, made, toward, the, recipient, of, an, aggression, by, a, group, member, other, than, the, aggressor, is, present, in, bonobos, a, 2013, study, found, that, both, the, affiliation, spontaneously, offered, by, a, bystander, to, the, victim, and, the, affiliation, requested, by, the, victim, solicited, affiliation, can, reduce, the, probability, of, further, aggression, by, group, members, on, the, victim, this, fact, supporting, the, victim, protection, hypothesis, yet, only, spontaneous, affiliation, reduced, victim, anxiety, measured, via, self, scratching, rates, thus, suggesting, not, only, that, non, solicited, affiliation, has, a, consolatory, function, but, also, that, the, spontaneous, gesture, more, than, the, protection, itself, works, in, calming, the, distressed, subject, the, authors, hypothesize, that, the, victim, may, perceive, the, motivational, autonomy, of, the, bystander, who, does, not, require, an, invitation, to, provide, post, conflict, affinitive, contact, moreover, spontaneous, but, not, solicited, third, party, affiliation, was, affected, by, the, bond, between, consoler, and, victim, this, supporting, the, consolation, hypothesis, importantly, spontaneous, affiliation, followed, the, empathic, gradient, described, for, humans, being, mostly, offered, to, kin, then, friends, then, acquaintances, these, categories, having, been, determined, using, affiliation, rates, between, individuals, hence, consolation, in, the, bonobo, may, be, an, empathy, based, phenomenon, instances, in, which, bonobos, have, expressed, joy, have, been, reported, one, study, analyzed, and, recorded, sounds, made, by, human, infants, and, bonobos, when, they, were, tickled, although, the, bonobos, laugh, was, at, a, higher, frequency, the, laugh, was, found, to, follow, a, spectrographic, pattern, similar, to, that, of, human, babies, bonobos, are, found, only, south, of, the, congo, river, and, north, of, the, kasai, river, a, tributary, of, the, congo, in, the, humid, forests, of, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, ernst, schwarz, s, 1927, paper, le, chimpanz, de, la, rive, gauche, du, congo, announcing, his, discovery, has, been, read, as, an, association, between, the, parisian, left, bank, and, the, left, bank, of, the, congo, river, the, bohemian, culture, in, paris, and, an, unconventional, ape, in, the, congo, the, ranges, of, bonobos, and, chimpanzees, are, separated, by, the, congo, river, with, bonobos, living, to, its, south, and, chimpanzees, to, the, north, in, the, congo, tropical, rainforest, the, very, great, majority, of, plants, need, animals, to, reproduce, and, disperse, their, seeds, bonobos, are, the, second, largest, frugivorous, animals, in, this, region, after, elephants, it, is, estimated, that, during, its, life, each, bonobo, will, ingest, and, disperse, nine, tons, of, seeds, from, more, than, 91, species, of, lianas, grass, trees, and, shrubs, these, seeds, travel, for, about, 24, hours, in, the, bonobo, digestive, tract, which, can, transfer, them, over, several, kilometers, mean, 1, 3, km, max, 4, 5, km, far, from, their, parents, where, they, will, be, deposited, intact, in, their, feces, these, dispersed, seeds, remain, viable, germinating, better, and, more, quickly, than, unpassed, seeds, for, those, seeds, diplochory, with, dung, beetles, scarabaeidae, improves, post, dispersal, survival, certain, plants, such, as, dialium, may, even, be, dependent, on, bonobos, to, activate, the, germination, of, their, seeds, characterized, by, tegumentary, dormancy, the, first, parameters, of, the, effectiveness, of, seed, dispersal, by, bonobos, are, present, behavior, of, the, bonobo, could, affect, the, population, structure, of, plants, whose, seeds, they, disperse, the, majority, of, these, zoochorous, plants, cannot, recruit, without, dispersal, and, the, homogeneous, spatial, structure, of, the, trees, suggests, a, direct, link, with, their, dispersal, agent, few, species, could, replace, bonobos, in, terms, of, seed, dispersal, services, just, as, bonobos, could, not, replace, elephants, there, is, little, functional, redundancy, between, frugivorous, mammals, of, the, congo, which, face, severe, human, hunting, pressures, and, local, extinction, the, defaunation, of, the, forests, leading, to, the, empty, forest, syndrome, is, critical, in, conservation, biology, the, disappearance, of, the, bonobos, which, disperse, seeds, of, 40, of, the, tree, species, in, these, forests, or, 11, 6, million, individual, seeds, during, the, life, of, each, bonobo, would, have, consequences, for, the, conservation, of, the, congo, rainforest, the, iucn, red, list, classifies, bonobos, as, an, endangered, species, with, conservative, population, estimates, ranging, from, 29, 500, to, 50, 000, individuals, major, threats, to, bonobo, populations, include, habitat, loss, and, hunting, for, bushmeat, the, latter, activity, having, increased, dramatically, during, the, first, and, second, congo, wars, in, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, due, to, the, presence, of, heavily, armed, militias, even, in, remote, protected, areas, such, as, salonga, national, park, this, is, part, of, a, more, general, trend, of, ape, extinction, as, the, bonobos, habitat, is, shared, with, many, people, the, ultimate, success, of, conservation, efforts, still, relies, on, local, and, community, involvement, the, issue, of, parks, versus, people, is, salient, in, the, cuvette, centrale, within, the, bonobos, range, there, is, strong, local, and, broad, based, congolese, resistance, to, establishing, national, parks, as, indigenous, communities, have, previously, been, driven, from, their, forest, homes, by, the, forming, of, parks, in, salonga, national, park, the, only, national, park, in, bonobo, habitat, there, is, no, local, involvement, and, surveys, undertaken, since, 2000, indicate, the, bonobo, the, african, forest, elephant, the, okapi, and, other, rare, species, have, been, devastated, by, poachers, and, the, thriving, bushmeat, trade, in, contrast, areas, do, exist, where, the, bonobo, and, ecological, biodiversity, still, thrive, without, any, established, park, borders, due, to, the, indigenous, beliefs, taboos, against, killing, bonobos, and, other, animals, during, the, wars, in, the, 1990s, researchers, and, international, non, governmental, organizations, ngos, were, driven, out, of, the, bonobo, habitat, in, 2002, the, bonobo, conservation, initiative, initiated, the, bonobo, peace, forest, project, supported, by, the, global, conservation, fund, of, conservation, international, in, cooperation, with, national, institutions, local, ngos, and, local, communities, the, peace, forest, project, works, with, local, communities, to, establish, a, linked, constellation, of, community, based, reserves, managed, by, local, and, indigenous, people, this, model, implemented, mainly, through, drc, organizations, and, local, communities, has, helped, bring, about, agreements, to, protect, over, 50, 000, square, miles, 130, 000, km, 2, of, the, bonobo, habitat, according, to, amy, parish, the, bonobo, peace, forest, is, going, to, be, a, model, for, conservation, in, the, 21st, century, the, port, town, of, basankusu, is, situated, on, the, lulonga, river, at, the, confluence, of, the, lopori, and, maringa, rivers, in, the, north, of, the, country, making, it, well, placed, to, receive, and, transport, local, goods, to, the, cities, of, mbandaka, and, kinshasa, with, basankusu, being, the, last, port, of, substance, before, the, wilderness, of, the, lopori, basin, and, the, lomako, river, the, bonobo, heartland, conservation, efforts, for, the, bonobo, use, the, town, as, a, base, in, 1995, concern, over, declining, numbers, of, bonobos, in, the, wild, led, the, zoological, society, of, milwaukee, zsm, in, milwaukee, wisconsin, with, contributions, from, bonobo, scientists, around, the, world, to, publish, the, action, plan, for, pan, paniscus, a, report, on, free, ranging, populations, and, proposals, for, their, preservation, the, action, plan, compiles, population, data, on, bonobos, from, 20, years, of, research, conducted, at, various, sites, throughout, the, bonobo, s, range, the, plan, identifies, priority, actions, for, bonobo, conservation, and, serves, as, a, reference, for, developing, conservation, programs, for, researchers, government, officials, and, donor, agencies, acting, on, action, plan, recommendations, the, zsm, developed, the, bonobo, and, congo, biodiversity, initiative, this, program, includes, habitat, and, rain, forest, preservation, training, for, congolese, nationals, and, conservation, institutions, wildlife, population, assessment, and, monitoring, and, education, the, zsm, has, conducted, regional, surveys, within, the, range, of, the, bonobo, in, conjunction, with, training, congolese, researchers, in, survey, methodology, and, biodiversity, monitoring, the, zsm, s, initial, goal, was, to, survey, salonga, national, park, to, determine, the, conservation, status, of, the, bonobo, within, the, park, and, to, provide, financial, and, technical, assistance, to, strengthen, park, protection, as, the, project, has, developed, the, zsm, has, become, more, involved, in, helping, the, congolese, living, in, bonobo, habitat, they, have, built, schools, hired, teachers, provided, some, medicines, and, started, an, agriculture, project, to, help, the, congolese, learn, to, grow, crops, and, depend, less, on, hunting, wild, animals, with, grants, from, the, united, nations, usaid, the, u, s, embassy, the, world, wildlife, fund, and, many, other, groups, and, individuals, the, zsm, also, has, been, working, to, starting, in, 2003, the, u, s, government, allocated, 54, million, to, the, congo, basin, forest, partnership, this, significant, investment, has, triggered, the, involvement, of, international, ngos, to, establish, bases, in, the, region, and, work, to, develop, bonobo, conservation, programs, this, initiative, should, improve, the, likelihood, of, bonobo, survival, but, its, success, still, may, depend, upon, building, greater, involvement, and, capability, in, local, and, indigenous, communities, the, bonobo, population, is, believed, to, have, declined, sharply, in, the, last, 30, years, though, surveys, have, been, hard, to, carry, out, in, war, ravaged, central, congo, estimates, range, from, 60, 000, to, fewer, than, 50, 000, living, according, to, the, world, wildlife, fund, in, addition, concerned, parties, have, addressed, the, crisis, on, several, science, and, ecological, websites, organizations, such, as, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, the, african, wildlife, foundation, and, others, are, trying, to, focus, attention, on, the, extreme, risk, to, the, species, some, have, suggested, that, a, reserve, be, established, in, a, more, stable, part, of, africa, or, on, an, island, in, a, place, such, as, indonesia, awareness, is, ever, increasing, and, even, nonscientific, or, ecological, sites, have, created, various, groups, to, collect, donations, to, help, with, the, conservation, of, this, species, world, bonobo, day, is, february, 14, valentine, s, day, this, was, established, in, 2017, by, the, african, wildlife, foundation
