in, ethology, animal, locomotion, is, any, of, a, variety, of, methods, that, animals, use, to, move, from, one, place, to, another, some, modes, of, locomotion, are, initially, self, propelled, e, g, running, swimming, jumping, flying, hopping, soaring, and, gliding, there, are, also, many, animal, species, that, depend, on, their, environment, for, transportation, a, type, of, mobility, called, passive, locomotion, e, g, sailing, some, jellyfish, kiting, spiders, rolling, some, beetles, and, spiders, or, riding, other, animals, phoresis, animals, move, for, a, variety, of, reasons, such, as, to, find, food, a, mate, a, suitable, microhabitat, or, to, escape, predators, for, many, animals, the, ability, to, move, is, essential, for, survival, and, as, a, result, natural, selection, has, shaped, the, locomotion, methods, and, mechanisms, used, by, moving, organisms, for, example, migratory, animals, that, travel, vast, distances, such, as, the, arctic, tern, typically, have, a, locomotion, mechanism, that, costs, very, little, energy, per, unit, distance, whereas, non, migratory, animals, that, must, frequently, move, quickly, to, escape, predators, are, likely, to, have, energetically, costly, but, very, fast, locomotion, the, anatomical, structures, that, animals, use, for, movement, including, cilia, legs, wings, arms, fins, or, tails, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, locomotory, organs, or, locomotory, structures, the, term, locomotion, is, formed, in, english, from, latin, loco, from, a, place, ablative, of, locus, place, motio, motion, a, moving, animals, move, through, or, on, five, types, of, environment, aquatic, in, or, on, water, terrestrial, on, ground, or, other, surface, including, arboreal, or, tree, dwelling, fossorial, underground, and, aerial, in, the, air, many, animals, for, example, semi, aquatic, animals, and, diving, birds, regularly, move, through, more, than, one, type, of, medium, in, some, cases, the, surface, they, move, on, facilitates, their, method, of, locomotion, in, water, staying, afloat, is, possible, using, buoyancy, if, an, animal, s, body, is, less, dense, than, water, it, can, stay, afloat, this, requires, little, energy, to, maintain, a, vertical, position, but, requires, more, energy, for, locomotion, in, the, horizontal, plane, compared, to, less, buoyant, animals, the, drag, encountered, in, water, is, much, greater, than, in, air, morphology, is, therefore, important, for, efficient, locomotion, which, is, in, most, cases, essential, for, basic, functions, such, as, catching, prey, a, fusiform, torpedo, like, body, form, is, seen, in, many, aquatic, animals, though, the, mechanisms, they, use, for, locomotion, are, diverse, the, primary, means, by, which, fish, generate, thrust, is, by, oscillating, the, body, from, side, to, side, the, resulting, wave, motion, ending, at, a, large, tail, fin, finer, control, such, as, for, slow, movements, is, often, achieved, with, thrust, from, pectoral, fins, or, front, limbs, in, marine, mammals, some, fish, e, g, the, spotted, ratfish, hydrolagus, colliei, and, batiform, fish, electric, rays, sawfishes, guitarfishes, skates, and, stingrays, use, their, pectoral, fins, as, the, primary, means, of, locomotion, sometimes, termed, labriform, swimming, marine, mammals, oscillate, their, body, in, an, up, and, down, dorso, ventral, direction, other, animals, e, g, penguins, diving, ducks, move, underwater, in, a, manner, which, has, been, termed, aquatic, flying, some, fish, propel, themselves, without, a, wave, motion, of, the, body, as, in, the, slow, moving, seahorses, and, gymnotus, other, animals, such, as, cephalopods, use, jet, propulsion, to, travel, fast, taking, in, water, then, squirting, it, back, out, in, an, explosive, burst, other, swimming, animals, may, rely, predominantly, on, their, limbs, much, as, humans, do, when, swimming, though, life, on, land, originated, from, the, seas, terrestrial, animals, have, returned, to, an, aquatic, lifestyle, on, several, occasions, such, as, the, fully, aquatic, cetaceans, now, very, distinct, from, their, terrestrial, ancestors, dolphins, sometimes, ride, on, the, bow, waves, created, by, boats, or, surf, on, naturally, breaking, waves, benthic, locomotion, is, movement, by, animals, that, live, on, in, or, near, the, bottom, of, aquatic, environments, in, the, sea, many, animals, walk, over, the, seabed, echinoderms, primarily, use, their, tube, feet, to, move, about, the, tube, feet, typically, have, a, tip, shaped, like, a, suction, pad, that, can, create, a, vacuum, through, contraction, of, muscles, this, along, with, some, stickiness, from, the, secretion, of, mucus, provides, adhesion, waves, of, tube, feet, contractions, and, relaxations, move, along, the, adherent, surface, and, the, animal, moves, slowly, along, some, sea, urchins, also, use, their, spines, for, benthic, locomotion, crabs, typically, walk, sideways, a, behaviour, that, gives, us, the, word, crabwise, this, is, because, of, the, articulation, of, the, legs, which, makes, a, sidelong, gait, more, efficient, however, some, crabs, walk, forwards, or, backwards, including, raninids, libinia, emarginata, and, mictyris, platycheles, some, crabs, notably, the, portunidae, and, matutidae, are, also, capable, of, swimming, the, portunidae, especially, so, as, their, last, pair, of, walking, legs, are, flattened, into, swimming, paddles, a, stomatopod, nannosquilla, decemspinosa, can, escape, by, rolling, itself, into, a, self, propelled, wheel, and, somersault, backwards, at, a, speed, of, 72, rpm, they, can, travel, more, than, 2, m, using, this, unusual, method, of, locomotion, velella, the, by, the, wind, sailor, is, a, cnidarian, with, no, means, of, propulsion, other, than, sailing, a, small, rigid, sail, projects, into, the, air, and, catches, the, wind, velella, sails, always, align, along, the, direction, of, the, wind, where, the, sail, may, act, as, an, aerofoil, so, that, the, animals, tend, to, sail, downwind, at, a, small, angle, to, the, wind, while, larger, animals, such, as, ducks, can, move, on, water, by, floating, some, small, animals, move, across, it, without, breaking, through, the, surface, this, surface, locomotion, takes, advantage, of, the, surface, tension, of, water, animals, that, move, in, such, a, way, include, the, water, strider, water, striders, have, legs, that, are, hydrophobic, preventing, them, from, interfering, with, the, structure, of, water, another, form, of, locomotion, in, which, the, surface, layer, is, broken, is, used, by, the, basilisk, lizard, gravity, is, the, primary, obstacle, to, flight, because, it, is, impossible, for, any, organism, to, have, a, density, as, low, as, that, of, air, flying, animals, must, generate, enough, lift, to, ascend, and, remain, airborne, one, way, to, achieve, this, is, with, wings, which, when, moved, through, the, air, generate, an, upward, lift, force, on, the, animal, s, body, flying, animals, must, be, very, light, to, achieve, flight, the, largest, living, flying, animals, being, birds, of, around, 20, kilograms, other, structural, adaptations, of, flying, animals, include, reduced, and, redistributed, body, weight, fusiform, shape, and, powerful, flight, muscles, there, may, also, be, physiological, adaptations, active, flight, has, independently, evolved, at, least, four, times, in, the, insects, pterosaurs, birds, and, bats, insects, were, the, first, taxon, to, evolve, flight, approximately, 400, million, years, ago, mya, followed, by, pterosaurs, approximately, 220, mya, birds, approximately, 160, mya, then, bats, about, 60, mya, rather, than, active, flight, some, semi, arboreal, animals, reduce, their, rate, of, falling, by, gliding, gliding, is, heavier, than, air, flight, without, the, use, of, thrust, the, term, volplaning, also, refers, to, this, mode, of, flight, in, animals, this, mode, of, flight, involves, flying, a, greater, distance, horizontally, than, vertically, and, therefore, can, be, distinguished, from, a, simple, descent, like, a, parachute, gliding, has, evolved, on, more, occasions, than, active, flight, there, are, examples, of, gliding, animals, in, several, major, taxonomic, classes, such, as, the, invertebrates, e, g, gliding, ants, reptiles, e, g, banded, flying, snake, amphibians, e, g, flying, frog, mammals, e, g, sugar, glider, squirrel, glider, some, aquatic, animals, also, regularly, use, gliding, for, example, flying, fish, octopus, and, squid, the, flights, of, flying, fish, are, typically, around, 50, meters, 160, ft, though, they, can, use, updrafts, at, the, leading, edge, of, waves, to, cover, distances, of, up, to, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, to, glide, upward, out, of, the, water, a, flying, fish, moves, its, tail, up, to, 70, times, per, second, several, oceanic, squid, such, as, the, pacific, flying, squid, leap, out, of, the, water, to, escape, predators, an, adaptation, similar, to, that, of, flying, fish, smaller, squids, fly, in, shoals, and, have, been, observed, to, cover, distances, as, long, as, 50, m, small, fins, towards, the, back, of, the, mantle, help, stabilize, the, motion, of, flight, they, exit, the, water, by, expelling, water, out, of, their, funnel, indeed, some, squid, have, been, observed, to, continue, jetting, water, while, airborne, providing, thrust, even, after, leaving, the, water, this, may, make, flying, squid, the, only, animals, with, jet, propelled, aerial, locomotion, the, neon, flying, squid, has, been, observed, to, glide, for, distances, over, 30, m, 100, ft, at, speeds, of, up, to, 11, 2, m, s, 37, ft, s, 25, mph, soaring, birds, can, maintain, flight, without, wing, flapping, using, rising, air, currents, many, gliding, birds, are, able, to, lock, their, extended, wings, by, means, of, a, specialized, tendon, soaring, birds, may, alternate, glides, with, periods, of, soaring, in, rising, air, five, principal, types, of, lift, are, used, thermals, ridge, lift, lee, waves, convergences, and, dynamic, soaring, examples, of, soaring, flight, by, birds, are, the, use, of, ballooning, is, a, method, of, locomotion, used, by, spiders, certain, silk, producing, arthropods, mostly, small, or, young, spiders, secrete, a, special, light, weight, gossamer, silk, for, ballooning, sometimes, traveling, great, distances, at, high, altitude, forms, of, locomotion, on, land, include, walking, running, hopping, or, jumping, dragging, and, crawling, or, slithering, here, friction, and, buoyancy, are, no, longer, an, issue, but, a, strong, skeletal, and, muscular, framework, are, required, in, most, terrestrial, animals, for, structural, support, each, step, also, requires, much, energy, to, overcome, inertia, and, animals, can, store, elastic, potential, energy, in, their, tendons, to, help, overcome, this, balance, is, also, required, for, movement, on, land, human, infants, learn, to, crawl, first, before, they, are, able, to, stand, on, two, feet, which, requires, good, coordination, as, well, as, physical, development, humans, are, bipedal, animals, standing, on, two, feet, and, keeping, one, on, the, ground, at, all, times, while, walking, when, running, only, one, foot, is, on, the, ground, at, any, one, time, at, most, and, both, leave, the, ground, briefly, at, higher, speeds, momentum, helps, keep, the, body, upright, so, more, energy, can, be, used, in, movement, jumping, saltation, can, be, distinguished, from, running, galloping, and, other, gaits, where, the, entire, body, is, temporarily, airborne, by, the, relatively, long, duration, of, the, aerial, phase, and, high, angle, of, initial, launch, many, terrestrial, animals, use, jumping, including, hopping, or, leaping, to, escape, predators, or, catch, prey, however, relatively, few, animals, use, this, as, a, primary, mode, of, locomotion, those, that, do, include, the, kangaroo, and, other, macropods, rabbit, hare, jerboa, hopping, mouse, and, kangaroo, rat, kangaroo, rats, often, leap, 2, m, and, reportedly, up, to, 2, 75, m, at, speeds, up, to, almost, 3, m, s, 6, 7, mph, they, can, quickly, change, their, direction, between, jumps, the, rapid, locomotion, of, the, banner, tailed, kangaroo, rat, may, minimize, energy, cost, and, predation, risk, its, use, of, a, move, freeze, mode, may, also, make, it, less, conspicuous, to, nocturnal, predators, frogs, are, relative, to, their, size, the, best, jumpers, of, all, vertebrates, the, australian, rocket, frog, litoria, nasuta, can, leap, over, 2, metres, 6, ft, 7, in, more, than, fifty, times, its, body, length, other, animals, move, in, terrestrial, habitats, without, the, aid, of, legs, earthworms, crawl, by, a, peristalsis, the, same, rhythmic, contractions, that, propel, food, through, the, digestive, tract, leeches, and, geometer, moth, caterpillars, move, by, looping, or, inching, measuring, off, a, length, with, each, movement, using, their, paired, circular, and, longitudinal, muscles, as, for, peristalsis, along, with, the, ability, to, attach, to, a, surface, at, both, anterior, and, posterior, ends, one, end, is, attached, often, the, thicker, end, and, the, other, end, often, thinner, is, projected, forward, peristaltically, until, it, touches, down, as, far, as, it, can, reach, then, the, first, end, is, released, pulled, forward, and, reattached, and, the, cycle, repeats, in, the, case, of, leeches, attachment, is, by, a, sucker, at, each, end, of, the, body, due, to, its, low, coefficient, of, friction, ice, provides, the, opportunity, for, other, modes, of, locomotion, penguins, either, waddle, on, their, feet, or, slide, on, their, bellies, across, the, snow, a, movement, called, tobogganing, which, conserves, energy, while, moving, quickly, some, pinnipeds, perform, a, similar, behaviour, called, sledding, some, animals, are, specialized, for, moving, on, non, horizontal, surfaces, one, common, habitat, for, such, climbing, animals, is, in, trees, for, example, the, gibbon, is, specialized, for, arboreal, movement, travelling, rapidly, by, brachiation, see, below, others, living, on, rock, faces, such, as, in, mountains, move, on, steep, or, even, near, vertical, surfaces, by, careful, balancing, and, leaping, perhaps, the, most, exceptional, are, the, various, types, of, mountain, dwelling, caprids, e, g, barbary, sheep, yak, ibex, rocky, mountain, goat, etc, whose, adaptations, can, include, a, soft, rubbery, pad, between, their, hooves, for, grip, hooves, with, sharp, keratin, rims, for, lodging, in, small, footholds, and, prominent, dew, claws, another, case, is, the, snow, leopard, which, being, a, predator, of, such, caprids, also, has, spectacular, balance, and, leaping, abilities, such, as, ability, to, leap, up, to, 17, m, 50, ft, some, light, animals, are, able, to, climb, up, smooth, sheer, surfaces, or, hang, upside, down, by, adhesion, using, suckers, many, insects, can, do, this, though, much, larger, animals, such, as, geckos, can, also, perform, similar, feats, species, have, different, numbers, of, legs, resulting, in, large, differences, in, locomotion, modern, birds, though, classified, as, tetrapods, usually, have, only, two, functional, legs, which, some, e, g, ostrich, emu, kiwi, use, as, their, primary, bipedal, mode, of, locomotion, a, few, modern, mammalian, species, are, habitual, bipeds, i, e, whose, normal, method, of, locomotion, is, two, legged, these, include, the, macropods, kangaroo, rats, and, mice, springhare, hopping, mice, pangolins, and, homininan, apes, bipedalism, is, rarely, found, outside, terrestrial, animals, though, at, least, two, types, of, octopus, walk, bipedally, on, the, sea, floor, using, two, of, their, arms, so, they, can, use, the, remaining, arms, to, camouflage, themselves, as, a, mat, of, algae, or, floating, coconut, there, are, no, three, legged, animals, though, some, macropods, such, as, kangaroos, that, alternate, between, resting, their, weight, on, their, muscular, tails, and, their, two, hind, legs, could, be, looked, at, as, an, example, of, tripedal, locomotion, in, animals, many, familiar, animals, are, quadrupedal, walking, or, running, on, four, legs, a, few, birds, use, quadrupedal, movement, in, some, circumstances, for, example, the, shoebill, sometimes, uses, its, wings, to, right, itself, after, lunging, at, prey, the, newly, hatched, hoatzin, bird, has, claws, on, its, thumb, and, first, finger, enabling, it, to, dexterously, climb, tree, branches, until, its, wings, are, strong, enough, for, sustained, flight, these, claws, are, gone, by, the, time, the, bird, reaches, adulthood, a, relatively, few, animals, use, five, limbs, for, locomotion, prehensile, quadrupeds, may, use, their, tail, to, assist, in, locomotion, and, when, grazing, the, kangaroos, and, other, macropods, use, their, tail, to, propel, themselves, forward, with, the, four, legs, used, to, maintain, balance, insects, generally, walk, with, six, legs, though, some, insects, such, as, nymphalid, butterflies, do, not, use, the, front, legs, for, walking, arachnids, have, eight, legs, most, arachnids, lack, extensor, muscles, in, the, distal, joints, of, their, appendages, spiders, and, whipscorpions, extend, their, limbs, hydraulically, using, the, pressure, of, their, hemolymph, solifuges, and, some, harvestmen, extend, their, knees, by, the, use, of, highly, elastic, thickenings, in, the, joint, cuticle, scorpions, pseudoscorpions, and, some, harvestmen, have, evolved, muscles, that, extend, two, leg, joints, the, femur, patella, and, patella, tibia, joints, at, once, the, scorpion, hadrurus, arizonensis, walks, by, using, two, groups, of, legs, left, 1, right, 2, left, 3, right, 4, and, right, 1, left, 2, right, 3, left, 4, in, a, reciprocating, fashion, this, alternating, tetrapod, coordination, is, used, over, all, walking, speeds, centipedes, and, millipedes, have, many, sets, of, legs, that, move, in, metachronal, rhythm, some, echinoderms, locomote, using, the, many, tube, feet, on, the, underside, of, their, arms, although, the, tube, feet, resemble, suction, cups, in, appearance, the, gripping, action, is, a, function, of, adhesive, chemicals, rather, than, suction, other, chemicals, and, relaxation, of, the, ampullae, allow, for, release, from, the, substrate, the, tube, feet, latch, on, to, surfaces, and, move, in, a, wave, with, one, arm, section, attaching, to, the, surface, as, another, releases, some, multi, armed, fast, moving, starfish, such, as, the, sunflower, seastar, pycnopodia, helianthoides, pull, themselves, along, with, some, of, their, arms, while, letting, others, trail, behind, other, starfish, turn, up, the, tips, of, their, arms, while, moving, which, exposes, the, sensory, tube, feet, and, eyespot, to, external, stimuli, most, starfish, cannot, move, quickly, a, typical, speed, being, that, of, the, leather, star, dermasterias, imbricata, which, can, manage, just, 15, cm, 6, in, in, a, minute, some, burrowing, species, from, the, genera, astropecten, and, luidia, have, points, rather, than, suckers, on, their, long, tube, feet, and, are, capable, of, much, more, rapid, motion, gliding, across, the, ocean, floor, the, sand, star, luidia, foliolata, can, travel, at, a, speed, of, 2, 8, m, 9, ft, 2, in, per, minute, sunflower, starfish, are, quick, efficient, hunters, moving, at, a, speed, of, 1, m, min, 3, 3, ft, min, using, 15, 000, tube, feet, many, animals, temporarily, change, the, number, of, legs, they, use, for, locomotion, in, different, circumstances, for, example, many, quadrupedal, animals, switch, to, bipedalism, to, reach, low, level, browse, on, trees, the, genus, of, basiliscus, are, arboreal, lizards, that, usually, use, quadrupedalism, in, the, trees, when, frightened, they, can, drop, to, water, below, and, run, across, the, surface, on, their, hind, limbs, at, about, 1, 5, m, s, for, a, distance, of, approximately, 4, 5, m, 15, ft, before, they, sink, to, all, fours, and, swim, they, can, also, sustain, themselves, on, all, fours, while, water, walking, to, increase, the, distance, travelled, above, the, surface, by, about, 1, 3, m, when, cockroaches, run, rapidly, they, rear, up, on, their, two, hind, legs, like, bipedal, humans, this, allows, them, to, run, at, speeds, up, to, 50, body, lengths, per, second, equivalent, to, a, couple, hundred, miles, per, hour, if, you, scale, up, to, the, size, of, humans, when, grazing, kangaroos, use, a, form, of, pentapedalism, four, legs, plus, the, tail, but, switch, to, hopping, bipedalism, when, they, wish, to, move, at, a, greater, speed, the, moroccan, flic, flac, spider, cebrennus, rechenbergi, uses, a, series, of, rapid, acrobatic, flic, flac, movements, of, its, legs, similar, to, those, used, by, gymnasts, to, actively, propel, itself, off, the, ground, allowing, it, to, move, both, down, and, uphill, even, at, a, 40, percent, incline, this, behaviour, is, different, than, other, huntsman, spiders, such, as, carparachne, aureoflava, from, the, namib, desert, which, uses, passive, cartwheeling, as, a, form, of, locomotion, the, flic, flac, spider, can, reach, speeds, of, up, to, 2, m, s, using, forward, or, back, flips, to, evade, threats, some, animals, move, through, solids, such, as, soil, by, burrowing, using, peristalsis, as, in, earthworms, or, other, methods, in, loose, solids, such, as, sand, some, animals, such, as, the, golden, mole, marsupial, mole, and, the, pink, fairy, armadillo, are, able, to, move, more, rapidly, swimming, through, the, loose, substrate, burrowing, animals, include, moles, ground, squirrels, naked, mole, rats, tilefish, and, mole, crickets, arboreal, locomotion, is, the, locomotion, of, animals, in, trees, some, animals, may, only, scale, trees, occasionally, while, others, are, exclusively, arboreal, these, habitats, pose, numerous, mechanical, challenges, to, animals, moving, through, them, leading, to, a, variety, of, anatomical, behavioural, and, ecological, consequences, as, well, as, variations, throughout, different, species, furthermore, many, of, these, same, principles, may, be, applied, to, climbing, without, trees, such, as, on, rock, piles, or, mountains, the, earliest, known, tetrapod, with, specializations, that, adapted, it, for, climbing, trees, was, suminia, a, synapsid, of, the, late, permian, about, 260, million, years, ago, some, invertebrate, animals, are, exclusively, arboreal, in, habitat, for, example, the, tree, snail, brachiation, from, brachium, latin, for, arm, is, a, form, of, arboreal, locomotion, in, which, primates, swing, from, tree, limb, to, tree, limb, using, only, their, arms, during, brachiation, the, body, is, alternately, supported, under, each, forelimb, this, is, the, primary, means, of, locomotion, for, the, small, gibbons, and, siamangs, of, southeast, asia, some, new, world, monkeys, such, as, spider, monkeys, and, muriquis, are, semibrachiators, and, move, through, the, trees, with, a, combination, of, leaping, and, brachiation, some, new, world, species, also, practice, suspensory, behaviors, by, using, their, prehensile, tail, which, acts, as, a, fifth, grasping, hand, pandas, are, known, to, swig, their, heads, laterally, as, they, ascend, vertical, surfaces, astonishingly, utilizing, their, head, as, a, propulsive, limb, in, a, anatomical, way, that, was, thought, to, only, be, practiced, by, certain, species, of, birds, animal, locomotion, requires, energy, to, overcome, various, forces, including, friction, drag, inertia, and, gravity, although, the, influence, of, these, depends, on, the, circumstances, in, terrestrial, environments, gravity, must, be, overcome, whereas, the, drag, of, air, has, little, influence, in, aqueous, environments, friction, or, drag, becomes, the, major, energetic, challenge, with, gravity, being, less, of, an, influence, remaining, in, the, aqueous, environment, animals, with, natural, buoyancy, expend, little, energy, to, maintain, a, vertical, position, in, a, water, column, others, naturally, sink, and, must, spend, energy, to, remain, afloat, drag, is, also, an, energetic, influence, in, flight, and, the, aerodynamically, efficient, body, shapes, of, flying, birds, indicate, how, they, have, evolved, to, cope, with, this, limbless, organisms, moving, on, land, must, energetically, overcome, surface, friction, however, they, do, not, usually, need, to, expend, significant, energy, to, counteract, gravity, newton, s, third, law, of, motion, is, widely, used, in, the, study, of, animal, locomotion, if, at, rest, to, move, forwards, an, animal, must, push, something, backwards, terrestrial, animals, must, push, the, solid, ground, swimming, and, flying, animals, must, push, against, a, fluid, either, water, or, air, the, effect, of, forces, during, locomotion, on, the, design, of, the, skeletal, system, is, also, important, as, is, the, interaction, between, locomotion, and, muscle, physiology, in, determining, how, the, structures, and, effectors, of, locomotion, enable, or, limit, animal, movement, the, energetics, of, locomotion, involves, the, energy, expenditure, by, animals, in, moving, energy, consumed, in, locomotion, is, not, available, for, other, efforts, so, animals, typically, have, evolved, to, use, the, minimum, energy, possible, during, movement, however, in, the, case, of, certain, behaviors, such, as, locomotion, to, escape, a, predator, performance, such, as, speed, or, maneuverability, is, more, crucial, and, such, movements, may, be, energetically, expensive, furthermore, animals, may, use, energetically, expensive, methods, of, locomotion, when, environmental, conditions, such, as, being, within, a, burrow, preclude, other, modes, the, most, common, metric, of, energy, use, during, locomotion, is, the, net, also, termed, incremental, cost, of, transport, defined, as, the, amount, of, energy, e, g, joules, needed, above, baseline, metabolic, rate, to, move, a, given, distance, for, aerobic, locomotion, most, animals, have, a, nearly, constant, cost, of, transport, moving, a, given, distance, requires, the, same, caloric, expenditure, regardless, of, speed, this, constancy, is, usually, accomplished, by, changes, in, gait, the, net, cost, of, transport, of, swimming, is, lowest, followed, by, flight, with, terrestrial, limbed, locomotion, being, the, most, expensive, per, unit, distance, however, because, of, the, speeds, involved, flight, requires, the, most, energy, per, unit, time, this, does, not, mean, that, an, animal, that, normally, moves, by, running, would, be, a, more, efficient, swimmer, however, these, comparisons, assume, an, animal, is, specialized, for, that, form, of, motion, another, consideration, here, is, body, mass, heavier, animals, though, using, more, total, energy, require, less, energy, per, unit, mass, to, move, physiologists, generally, measure, energy, use, by, the, amount, of, oxygen, consumed, or, the, amount, of, carbon, dioxide, produced, in, an, animal, s, respiration, in, terrestrial, animals, the, cost, of, transport, is, typically, measured, while, they, walk, or, run, on, a, motorized, treadmill, either, wearing, a, mask, to, capture, gas, exchange, or, with, the, entire, treadmill, enclosed, in, a, metabolic, chamber, for, small, rodents, such, as, deer, mice, the, cost, of, transport, has, also, been, measured, during, voluntary, wheel, running, energetics, is, important, for, explaining, the, evolution, of, foraging, economic, decisions, in, organisms, for, example, a, study, of, the, african, honey, bee, a, m, scutellata, has, shown, that, honey, bees, may, trade, the, high, sucrose, content, of, viscous, nectar, off, for, the, energetic, benefits, of, warmer, less, concentrated, nectar, which, also, reduces, their, consumption, and, flight, time, passive, locomotion, in, animals, is, a, type, of, mobility, in, which, the, animal, depends, on, their, environment, for, transportation, such, animals, are, vagile, but, not, motile, the, portuguese, man, o, war, physalia, physalis, lives, at, the, surface, of, the, ocean, the, gas, filled, bladder, or, pneumatophore, sometimes, called, a, sail, remains, at, the, surface, while, the, remainder, is, submerged, because, the, portuguese, man, o, war, has, no, means, of, propulsion, it, is, moved, by, a, combination, of, winds, currents, and, tides, the, sail, is, equipped, with, a, siphon, in, the, event, of, a, surface, attack, the, sail, can, be, deflated, allowing, the, organism, to, briefly, submerge, the, violet, sea, snail, janthina, janthina, uses, a, buoyant, foam, raft, stabilized, by, amphiphilic, mucins, to, float, at, the, sea, surface, the, wheel, spider, carparachne, aureoflava, is, a, huntsman, spider, approximately, 20, mm, in, size, and, native, to, the, namib, desert, of, southern, africa, the, spider, escapes, parasitic, pompilid, wasps, by, flipping, onto, its, side, and, cartwheeling, down, sand, dunes, at, speeds, of, up, to, 44, turns, per, second, if, the, spider, is, on, a, sloped, dune, its, rolling, speed, may, be, 1, metre, per, second, a, spider, usually, limited, to, individuals, of, a, small, species, or, spiderling, after, hatching, climbs, as, high, as, it, can, stands, on, raised, legs, with, its, abdomen, pointed, upwards, tiptoeing, and, then, releases, several, silk, threads, from, its, spinnerets, into, the, air, these, form, a, triangle, shaped, parachute, that, carries, the, spider, on, updrafts, of, winds, where, even, the, slightest, breeze, transports, it, the, earth, s, static, electric, field, may, also, provide, lift, in, windless, conditions, the, larva, of, cicindela, dorsalis, the, eastern, beach, tiger, beetle, is, notable, for, its, ability, to, leap, into, the, air, loop, its, body, into, a, rotating, wheel, and, roll, along, the, sand, at, a, high, speed, using, wind, to, propel, itself, if, the, wind, is, strong, enough, the, larva, can, cover, up, to, 60, metres, 200, ft, in, this, manner, this, remarkable, ability, may, have, evolved, to, help, the, larva, escape, predators, such, as, the, thynnid, wasp, methocha, members, of, the, largest, subfamily, of, cuckoo, wasps, chrysidinae, are, generally, kleptoparasites, laying, their, eggs, in, host, nests, where, their, larvae, consume, the, host, egg, or, larva, while, it, is, still, young, chrysidines, are, distinguished, from, the, members, of, other, subfamilies, in, that, most, have, flattened, or, concave, lower, abdomens, and, can, curl, into, a, defensive, ball, when, attacked, by, a, potential, host, a, process, known, as, conglobation, protected, by, hard, chitin, in, this, position, they, are, expelled, from, the, nest, without, injury, and, can, search, for, a, less, hostile, host, fleas, can, jump, vertically, up, to, 18, cm, and, horizontally, up, to, 33, cm, however, although, this, form, of, locomotion, is, initiated, by, the, flea, it, has, little, control, of, the, jump, they, always, jump, in, the, same, direction, with, very, little, variation, in, the, trajectory, between, individual, jumps, although, stomatopods, typically, display, the, standard, locomotion, types, as, seen, in, true, shrimp, and, lobsters, one, species, nannosquilla, decemspinosa, has, been, observed, flipping, itself, into, a, crude, wheel, the, species, lives, in, shallow, sandy, areas, at, low, tides, n, decemspinosa, is, often, stranded, by, its, short, rear, legs, which, are, sufficient, for, locomotion, when, the, body, is, supported, by, water, but, not, on, dry, land, the, mantis, shrimp, then, performs, a, forward, flip, in, an, attempt, to, roll, towards, the, next, tide, pool, n, decemspinosa, has, been, observed, to, roll, repeatedly, for, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, but, they, typically, travel, less, than, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, again, the, animal, initiates, the, movement, but, has, little, control, during, its, locomotion, some, animals, change, location, because, they, are, attached, to, or, reside, on, another, animal, or, moving, structure, this, is, arguably, more, accurately, termed, animal, transport, remoras, are, a, family, echeneidae, of, ray, finned, fish, they, grow, to, 30, 90, cm, 0, 98, 2, 95, ft, long, and, their, distinctive, first, dorsal, fins, take, the, form, of, a, modified, oval, sucker, like, organ, with, slat, like, structures, that, open, and, close, to, create, suction, and, take, a, firm, hold, against, the, skin, of, larger, marine, animals, by, sliding, backward, the, remora, can, increase, the, suction, or, it, can, release, itself, by, swimming, forward, remoras, sometimes, attach, to, small, boats, they, swim, well, on, their, own, with, a, sinuous, or, curved, motion, when, the, remora, reaches, about, 3, cm, 1, 2, in, the, disc, is, fully, formed, and, the, remora, can, then, attach, to, other, animals, the, remora, s, lower, jaw, projects, beyond, the, upper, and, the, animal, lacks, a, swim, bladder, some, remoras, associate, primarily, with, specific, host, species, they, are, commonly, found, attached, to, sharks, manta, rays, whales, turtles, and, dugongs, smaller, remoras, also, fasten, onto, fish, such, as, tuna, and, swordfish, and, some, small, remoras, travel, in, the, mouths, or, gills, of, large, manta, rays, ocean, sunfish, swordfish, and, sailfish, the, remora, benefits, by, using, the, host, as, transport, and, protection, and, also, feeds, on, materials, dropped, by, the, host, in, some, species, of, anglerfish, when, a, male, finds, a, female, he, bites, into, her, skin, and, releases, an, enzyme, that, digests, the, skin, of, his, mouth, and, her, body, fusing, the, pair, down, to, the, blood, vessel, level, the, male, becomes, dependent, on, the, female, host, for, survival, by, receiving, nutrients, via, their, shared, circulatory, system, and, provides, sperm, to, the, female, in, return, after, fusing, males, increase, in, volume, and, become, much, larger, relative, to, free, living, males, of, the, species, they, live, and, remain, reproductively, functional, as, long, as, the, female, lives, and, can, take, part, in, multiple, spawnings, this, extreme, sexual, dimorphism, ensures, when, the, female, is, ready, to, spawn, she, has, a, mate, immediately, available, multiple, males, can, be, incorporated, into, a, single, individual, female, with, up, to, eight, males, in, some, species, though, some, taxa, appear, to, have, a, one, male, per, female, rule, many, parasites, are, transported, by, their, hosts, for, example, endoparasites, such, as, tapeworms, live, in, the, alimentary, tracts, of, other, animals, and, depend, on, the, host, s, ability, to, move, to, distribute, their, eggs, ectoparasites, such, as, fleas, can, move, around, on, the, body, of, their, host, but, are, transported, much, longer, distances, by, the, host, s, locomotion, some, ectoparasites, such, as, lice, can, opportunistically, hitch, a, ride, on, a, fly, phoresis, and, attempt, to, find, a, new, host, some, animals, locomote, between, different, media, e, g, from, aquatic, to, aerial, this, often, requires, different, modes, of, locomotion, in, the, different, media, and, may, require, a, distinct, transitional, locomotor, behaviour, there, are, a, large, number, of, semi, aquatic, animals, animals, that, spend, part, of, their, life, cycle, in, water, or, generally, have, part, of, their, anatomy, underwater, these, represent, the, major, taxa, of, mammals, e, g, beaver, otter, polar, bear, birds, e, g, penguins, ducks, reptiles, e, g, anaconda, bog, turtle, marine, iguana, and, amphibians, e, g, salamanders, frogs, newts, some, fish, use, multiple, modes, of, locomotion, walking, fish, may, swim, freely, or, at, other, times, walk, along, the, ocean, or, river, floor, but, not, on, land, e, g, the, flying, gurnard, which, does, not, actually, fly, and, batfishes, of, the, family, ogcocephalidae, amphibious, fish, are, fish, that, are, able, to, leave, water, for, extended, periods, of, time, these, fish, use, a, range, of, terrestrial, locomotory, modes, such, as, lateral, undulation, tripod, like, walking, using, paired, fins, and, tail, and, jumping, many, of, these, locomotory, modes, incorporate, multiple, combinations, of, pectoral, pelvic, and, tail, fin, movement, examples, include, eels, mudskippers, and, the, walking, catfish, flying, fish, can, make, powerful, self, propelled, leaps, out, of, water, into, air, where, their, long, wing, like, fins, enable, gliding, flight, for, considerable, distances, above, the, water, s, surface, this, uncommon, ability, is, a, natural, defence, mechanism, to, evade, predators, the, flights, of, flying, fish, are, typically, around, 50, m, though, they, can, use, updrafts, at, the, leading, edge, of, waves, to, cover, distances, of, up, to, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, they, can, travel, at, speeds, of, more, than, 70, km, h, 43, mph, maximum, altitude, is, 6, m, 20, ft, above, the, surface, of, the, sea, some, accounts, have, them, landing, on, ships, decks, when, swimming, several, marine, mammals, such, as, dolphins, porpoises, and, pinnipeds, frequently, leap, above, the, water, surface, whilst, maintaining, horizontal, locomotion, this, is, done, for, various, reasons, when, travelling, jumping, can, save, dolphins, and, porpoises, energy, as, there, is, less, friction, while, in, the, air, this, type, of, travel, is, known, as, porpoising, other, reasons, for, dolphins, and, porpoises, performing, porpoising, include, orientation, social, displays, fighting, non, verbal, communication, entertainment, and, attempting, to, dislodge, parasites, in, pinnipeds, two, types, of, porpoising, have, been, identified, high, porpoising, is, most, often, near, within, 100, m, the, shore, and, is, often, followed, by, minor, course, changes, this, may, help, seals, get, their, bearings, on, beaching, or, rafting, sites, low, porpoising, is, typically, observed, relatively, far, more, than, 100, m, from, shore, and, often, aborted, in, favour, of, anti, predator, movements, this, may, be, a, way, for, seals, to, maximize, sub, surface, vigilance, and, thereby, reduce, their, vulnerability, to, sharks, some, whales, raise, their, entire, body, vertically, out, of, the, water, in, a, behaviour, known, as, breaching, some, semi, aquatic, birds, use, terrestrial, locomotion, surface, swimming, underwater, swimming, and, flying, e, g, ducks, swans, diving, birds, also, use, diving, locomotion, e, g, dippers, auks, some, birds, e, g, ratites, have, lost, the, primary, locomotion, of, flight, the, largest, of, these, ostriches, when, being, pursued, by, a, predator, have, been, known, to, reach, speeds, over, 70, km, h, 43, mph, and, can, maintain, a, steady, speed, of, 50, km, h, 31, mph, which, makes, the, ostrich, the, world, s, fastest, two, legged, animal, ostriches, can, also, locomote, by, swimming, penguins, either, waddle, on, their, feet, or, slide, on, their, bellies, across, the, snow, a, movement, called, tobogganing, which, conserves, energy, while, moving, quickly, they, also, jump, with, both, feet, together, if, they, want, to, move, more, quickly, or, cross, steep, or, rocky, terrain, to, get, onto, land, penguins, sometimes, propel, themselves, upwards, at, a, great, speed, to, leap, out, the, water, an, animal, s, mode, of, locomotion, may, change, considerably, during, its, life, cycle, barnacles, are, exclusively, marine, and, tend, to, live, in, shallow, and, tidal, waters, they, have, two, nektonic, active, swimming, larval, stages, but, as, adults, they, are, sessile, non, motile, suspension, feeders, frequently, adults, are, found, attached, to, moving, objects, such, as, whales, and, ships, and, are, thereby, transported, passive, locomotion, around, the, oceans, animals, locomote, for, a, variety, of, reasons, such, as, to, find, food, a, mate, a, suitable, microhabitat, or, to, escape, predators, animals, use, locomotion, in, a, wide, variety, of, ways, to, procure, food, terrestrial, methods, include, ambush, predation, social, predation, and, grazing, aquatic, methods, include, filterfeeding, grazing, ram, feeding, suction, feeding, protrusion, and, pivot, feeding, other, methods, include, parasitism, and, parasitoidism, the, study, of, animal, locomotion, is, a, branch, of, biology, that, investigates, and, quantifies, how, animals, move, it, is, an, application, of, kinematics, used, to, understand, how, the, movements, of, animal, limbs, relate, to, the, motion, of,
