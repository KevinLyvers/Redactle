the, electric, eels, are, a, genus, electrophorus, of, neotropical, freshwater, fish, from, south, america, in, the, family, gymnotidae, they, are, known, for, their, ability, to, stun, their, prey, by, generating, electricity, delivering, shocks, at, up, to, 860, volts, their, electrical, capabilities, were, first, studied, in, 1775, contributing, to, the, invention, in, 1800, of, the, electric, battery, despite, their, name, electric, eels, are, not, closely, related, to, the, true, eels, anguilliformes, but, are, members, of, the, electroreceptive, knifefish, order, gymnotiformes, this, order, is, more, closely, related, to, catfish, in, 2019, electric, eels, were, split, into, three, species, for, more, than, two, centuries, before, that, the, genus, was, believed, to, be, monotypic, containing, only, electrophorus, electricus, they, are, nocturnal, obligate, air, breathing, animals, with, poor, vision, complemented, by, electrolocation, they, mainly, eat, fish, electric, eels, grow, for, as, long, as, they, live, adding, more, vertebrae, to, their, spinal, column, males, are, larger, than, females, some, captive, specimens, have, lived, for, over, 20, years, when, the, species, now, defined, as, electrophorus, electricus, was, described, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1766, based, on, early, field, research, by, europeans, in, south, america, and, specimens, sent, back, to, europe, for, study, he, used, the, name, gymnotus, electricus, placing, it, in, the, same, genus, as, gymnotus, carapo, the, banded, knifefish, he, noted, that, the, fish, is, from, the, rivers, of, surinam, that, it, causes, painful, shocks, and, that, it, had, small, pits, around, the, head, in, 1864, theodore, gill, moved, the, electric, eel, to, its, own, genus, electrophorus, the, name, is, from, the, greek, lektron, amber, a, substance, able, to, hold, static, electricity, and, ph, r, i, carry, giving, the, meaning, electricity, bearer, in, 1872, gill, decided, that, the, electric, eel, was, sufficiently, distinct, to, have, its, own, family, electrophoridae, in, 1998, albert, and, campos, da, paz, lumped, the, electrophorus, genus, with, the, family, gymnotidae, alongside, gymnotus, as, did, ferraris, and, colleagues, in, 2017, in, 2019, c, david, de, santana, and, colleagues, divided, e, electricus, into, three, species, based, on, dna, divergence, ecology, and, habitat, anatomy, and, physiology, and, electrical, ability, the, three, species, are, e, electricus, now, in, a, narrower, sense, than, before, and, the, two, new, species, e, voltai, and, e, varii, electric, eels, form, a, clade, of, strongly, electric, fishes, within, the, order, gymnotiformes, the, south, american, knifefishes, electric, eels, are, thus, not, closely, related, to, the, true, eels, anguilliformes, the, lineage, of, the, electrophorus, genus, is, estimated, to, have, split, from, its, sister, taxon, gymnotus, sometime, in, the, cretaceous, most, knifefishes, are, weakly, electric, capable, of, active, electrolocation, but, not, of, delivering, shocks, their, relationships, as, shown, in, the, cladogram, were, analysed, by, sequencing, their, mitochondrial, dna, in, 2019, actively, electrolocating, fish, are, marked, with, a, small, yellow, lightning, flash, fish, able, to, deliver, electric, shocks, are, marked, with, a, red, lightning, flash, siluriformes, catfish, some, apteronotidae, ghost, knifefishes, hypopomidae, bluntnose, knifefishes, rhamphichthyidae, sand, knifefishes, gymnotus, banded, knifefishes, electrophorus, electric, eels, sternopygidae, glass, knifefishes, piranhas, tetras, and, allies, there, are, three, described, species, in, the, genus, not, differing, significantly, in, body, shape, or, coloration, e, varii, appears, to, have, diverged, from, the, other, species, around, 7, 1, mya, during, the, late, miocene, while, e, electricus, and, e, voltai, may, have, split, around, 3, 6, mya, during, the, pliocene, the, three, species, have, largely, non, overlapping, distributions, in, the, northern, part, of, south, america, e, electricus, is, northern, confined, to, the, guiana, shield, while, e, voltai, is, southern, ranging, from, the, brazilian, shield, northwards, both, species, live, in, upland, waters, e, varii, is, central, largely, in, the, lowlands, the, lowland, region, of, e, varii, is, a, variable, environment, with, habitats, ranging, from, streams, through, grassland, and, ravines, to, ponds, and, large, changes, in, water, level, between, the, wet, and, dry, seasons, all, live, on, muddy, river, bottoms, and, sometimes, swamps, favouring, areas, in, deep, shade, they, can, tolerate, water, low, in, oxygen, as, they, swim, to, the, surface, to, breathe, air, electric, eels, are, mostly, nocturnal, e, voltai, mainly, eats, fish, in, particular, the, armoured, catfish, megalechis, thoracata, a, specimen, of, e, voltai, had, a, caecilian, a, legless, amphibian, typhlonectes, compressicauda, in, its, stomach, it, is, possible, that, this, means, that, the, species, is, resistant, to, the, caecilian, s, toxic, skin, secretions, e, voltai, sometimes, hunts, in, packs, and, have, been, observed, targeting, a, shoal, of, tetras, then, herding, them, and, launching, joint, strikes, on, the, closely, packed, fish, the, other, species, e, varii, is, also, a, fish, predator, it, preys, especially, on, callichthyidae, armoured, catfishes, and, cichlidae, cichlids, electric, eels, have, long, stout, bodies, being, somewhat, cylindrical, at, the, front, but, more, flattened, towards, the, tail, end, e, electricus, can, reach, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, in, length, and, 20, kg, 44, lb, in, weight, the, mouth, is, at, the, front, of, the, snout, and, opens, upwards, they, have, smooth, thick, brown, to, black, skin, with, a, yellow, or, red, underbelly, and, no, scales, the, pectoral, fins, each, possess, eight, tiny, radial, bones, at, the, tip, they, have, over, 100, precaudal, vertebrae, excluding, the, tail, whereas, other, gymnotids, have, up, to, 51, of, these, there, can, be, as, many, as, 300, vertebrae, in, total, there, is, no, clear, boundary, between, the, tail, fin, and, the, anal, fin, which, extends, much, of, the, length, of, the, body, on, the, underside, and, has, over, 400, bony, rays, electric, eels, rely, on, the, wave, like, movements, of, their, elongated, anal, fin, to, propel, themselves, through, the, water, electric, eels, get, most, of, their, oxygen, by, breathing, air, using, buccal, pumping, this, enables, them, to, live, in, habitats, with, widely, varying, oxygen, levels, including, streams, swamps, and, pools, 719, 720, uniquely, among, the, gymnotids, the, buccal, cavity, is, lined, with, a, frilled, mucosa, which, has, a, rich, blood, supply, enabling, gas, exchange, between, the, air, and, the, blood, about, every, two, minutes, the, fish, takes, in, air, through, the, mouth, holds, it, in, the, buccal, cavity, and, expels, it, through, the, opercular, openings, at, the, sides, of, the, head, unlike, in, other, air, breathing, fish, the, tiny, gills, of, electric, eels, do, not, ventilate, when, taking, in, air, the, majority, of, carbon, dioxide, produced, is, expelled, through, the, skin, these, fish, can, survive, on, land, for, some, hours, if, their, skin, is, wet, enough, electric, eels, have, small, eyes, and, poor, vision, they, are, capable, of, hearing, via, a, weberian, apparatus, which, consists, of, tiny, bones, connecting, the, inner, ear, to, the, swim, bladder, all, of, the, vital, organs, are, packed, in, near, the, front, of, the, animal, taking, up, only, 20, of, space, and, sequestered, from, the, electric, organs, electric, eels, can, locate, their, prey, using, electroreceptors, derived, from, the, lateral, line, organ, in, the, head, the, lateral, line, itself, is, mechanosensory, enabling, them, to, sense, water, movements, created, by, animals, nearby, the, lateral, line, canals, are, beneath, the, skin, but, their, position, is, visible, as, lines, of, pits, on, the, head, electric, eels, use, their, high, frequency, sensitive, tuberous, receptors, distributed, in, patches, over, the, body, for, hunting, other, knifefish, electric, eels, have, three, pairs, of, electric, organs, arranged, longitudinally, the, main, organ, hunter, s, organ, and, sachs, organ, these, organs, give, electric, eels, the, ability, to, generate, two, types, of, electric, organ, discharges, low, voltage, and, high, voltage, the, organs, are, made, of, electrocytes, modified, from, muscle, cells, like, muscle, cells, the, electric, eel, s, electrocytes, contain, the, proteins, actin, and, desmin, but, where, muscle, cell, proteins, form, a, dense, structure, of, parallel, fibrils, in, electrocytes, they, form, a, loose, network, five, different, forms, of, desmin, occur, in, electrocytes, compared, to, two, or, three, in, muscle, but, its, function, in, electrocytes, remained, unknown, as, of, 2017, potassium, channel, proteins, involved, in, electric, organ, discharge, including, kcna1, kcnh6, and, kcnj12, are, distributed, differently, among, the, three, electric, organs, most, such, proteins, are, most, abundant, in, the, main, organ, and, least, abundant, in, sachs, s, organ, but, kcnh6, is, most, abundant, in, sachs, s, organ, the, main, organ, and, hunter, s, organ, are, rich, in, the, protein, calmodulin, involved, in, controlling, calcium, ion, levels, calmodulin, and, calcium, help, to, regulate, the, voltage, gated, sodium, channels, that, create, the, electrical, discharge, these, organs, are, also, rich, in, sodium, potassium, atpase, an, ion, pump, used, to, create, a, potential, difference, across, cell, membranes, the, maximum, discharge, from, the, main, organ, is, at, least, 600, volts, making, electric, eels, the, most, powerful, of, all, electric, fishes, freshwater, fishes, like, the, electric, eel, require, a, high, voltage, to, give, a, strong, shock, because, freshwater, has, high, resistance, powerful, marine, electric, fishes, like, the, torpedo, ray, give, a, shock, at, much, lower, voltage, but, a, far, higher, current, the, electric, eel, produces, its, strong, discharge, extremely, rapidly, at, a, rate, of, as, much, as, 500, hertz, meaning, that, each, shock, lasts, only, about, two, milliseconds, to, generate, a, high, voltage, an, electric, eel, stacks, some, 6, 000, electrocytes, in, series, longitudinally, in, its, main, organ, the, organ, contains, some, 35, such, stacks, in, parallel, on, each, side, of, the, body, the, ability, to, produce, high, voltage, high, frequency, pulses, in, addition, enables, the, electric, eel, to, electrolocate, rapidly, moving, prey, the, total, electric, current, delivered, during, each, pulse, can, reach, about, 1, ampere, it, remains, unclear, why, electric, eels, have, three, electric, organs, but, basically, produce, two, types, of, discharge, to, electrolocate, or, to, stun, in, 2021, jun, xu, and, colleagues, stated, that, hunter, s, organ, produces, a, third, type, of, discharge, at, a, middle, voltage, of, 38, 5, to, 56, 5, volts, their, measurements, indicate, that, this, is, produced, just, once, for, less, than, 2, milliseconds, after, the, low, voltage, discharge, of, sachs, s, organ, and, before, the, high, voltage, discharge, of, the, main, organ, they, believed, that, this, is, insufficient, to, stimulate, a, response, from, the, prey, so, they, suggested, it, may, have, the, function, of, co, ordination, within, the, electric, eel, s, body, perhaps, by, balancing, the, electrical, charge, but, state, that, more, research, is, needed, when, an, electric, eel, identifies, prey, its, brain, sends, a, nerve, signal, to, the, electric, organ, the, nerve, cells, involved, release, the, neurotransmitter, chemical, acetylcholine, to, trigger, an, electric, organ, discharge, this, opens, ion, channels, allowing, sodium, to, flow, into, the, electrocytes, reversing, the, polarity, momentarily, the, discharge, is, terminated, by, an, outflow, of, potassium, ions, through, a, separate, set, of, ion, channels, by, causing, a, sudden, difference, in, electric, potential, it, generates, an, electric, current, in, a, manner, similar, to, a, battery, in, which, cells, are, stacked, to, produce, a, desired, total, voltage, output, it, has, been, suggested, that, sachs, organ, is, used, for, electrolocation, its, discharge, is, of, nearly, 10, volts, at, a, frequency, of, around, 25, hz, the, main, organ, supported, by, hunter, s, organ, in, some, way, is, used, to, stun, prey, or, to, deter, predators, it, can, emit, signals, at, rates, of, several, hundred, hertz, electric, eels, can, concentrate, the, discharge, to, stun, prey, more, effectively, by, curling, up, and, making, contact, with, the, prey, at, two, points, along, the, body, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, electric, eels, can, control, their, prey, s, nervous, systems, and, muscles, via, electrical, pulses, keeping, prey, from, escaping, or, forcing, it, to, move, so, they, can, locate, it, but, this, has, been, disputed, in, self, defence, electric, eels, have, been, observed, to, leap, from, the, water, to, deliver, electric, shocks, to, animals, that, might, pose, a, threat, the, shocks, from, leaping, electric, eels, are, powerful, enough, to, drive, away, animals, as, large, as, horses, electric, eels, reproduce, during, the, dry, season, from, september, to, december, during, this, time, male, female, pairs, are, seen, in, small, pools, left, behind, after, water, levels, drop, the, male, makes, a, nest, using, his, saliva, and, the, female, deposits, around, 1, 200, eggs, for, fertilisation, spawn, hatch, seven, days, later, and, mothers, keep, depositing, eggs, periodically, throughout, the, breeding, season, making, them, fractional, spawners, when, they, reach, 15, mm, 0, 59, in, the, hatched, larvae, consume, any, leftover, eggs, and, after, they, reach, 9, cm, 3, 5, in, they, begin, to, eat, other, foods, electric, eels, are, sexually, dimorphic, males, becoming, reproductively, active, at, 1, 2, m, 3, ft, 11, in, in, length, and, growing, larger, than, females, females, start, to, reproduce, at, a, body, length, of, around, 70, cm, 2, ft, 4, in, the, adults, provide, prolonged, parental, care, lasting, four, months, e, electricus, and, e, voltai, the, two, upland, species, which, live, in, fast, flowing, rivers, appear, to, make, less, use, of, parental, care, the, male, provides, protection, for, both, the, young, and, the, nest, captive, specimens, have, sometimes, lived, for, over, 20, years, as, the, fish, grow, they, continually, add, more, vertebrae, to, their, spinal, column, the, main, organ, is, the, first, electric, organ, to, develop, followed, by, sachs, organ, and, then, hunter, s, organ, all, the, electric, organs, are, differentiated, by, the, time, the, body, reaches, a, length, of, 23, cm, 9, 1, in, electric, eels, are, able, to, produce, electrical, discharges, when, they, are, as, small, as, 7, cm, 2, 8, in, the, first, written, mention, of, the, electric, eel, or, purak, the, one, that, numbs, in, tupi, is, in, records, by, the, jesuit, priest, fern, o, cardim, in, 1583, the, naturalists, bertrand, bajon, a, french, military, surgeon, in, french, guiana, and, the, jesuit, ram, n, m, termeyer, in, the, river, plate, basin, conducted, early, experiments, on, the, numbing, discharges, of, electric, eels, in, the, 1760s, in, 1775, the, torpedo, the, electric, ray, was, studied, by, john, walsh, both, fish, were, dissected, by, the, surgeon, and, anatomist, john, hunter, hunter, informed, the, royal, society, that, gymnotus, electricus, appears, very, much, like, an, eel, but, it, has, none, of, the, specific, properties, of, that, fish, he, observed, that, there, were, two, pair, of, these, organs, a, larger, and, a, smaller, one, being, placed, on, each, side, and, that, they, occupied, perhaps, more, than, one, third, of, the, whole, animal, he, described, the, structure, of, the, organs, stacks, of, electrocytes, as, extremely, simple, and, regular, consisting, of, two, parts, viz, flat, partitions, or, septa, and, cross, divisions, between, them, he, measured, the, electrocytes, as, 1, 17, inch, 1, 5, mm, thick, in, the, main, organ, and, 1, 56, inch, 0, 45, mm, thick, in, hunter, s, organ, also, in, 1775, the, american, physician, and, politician, hugh, williamson, who, had, studied, with, hunter, presented, a, paper, experiments, and, observations, on, the, gymnotus, electricus, or, electric, eel, at, the, royal, society, he, reported, a, series, of, experiments, such, as, 7, in, order, to, discover, whether, the, eel, killed, those, fish, by, an, emission, of, the, same, fluid, with, which, he, affected, my, hand, when, i, had, touched, him, i, put, my, hand, into, the, water, at, some, distance, from, the, eel, another, cat, fish, was, thrown, into, the, water, the, eel, swam, up, to, it, gave, it, a, shock, by, which, it, instantly, turned, up, its, belly, and, continued, motionless, at, that, very, instant, i, felt, such, a, sensation, in, the, joints, of, my, fingers, as, in, experiment, 4, and, 12, instead, of, putting, my, hand, into, the, water, at, a, distance, from, the, eel, as, in, the, last, experiment, i, touched, its, tail, so, as, not, to, offend, it, while, my, assistant, touched, its, head, more, roughly, we, both, received, a, severe, shock, the, studies, by, williamson, walsh, and, hunter, appear, to, have, influenced, the, thinking, of, luigi, galvani, and, alessandro, volta, galvani, founded, electrophysiology, with, research, into, how, electricity, makes, a, frog, s, leg, twitch, volta, began, electrochemistry, with, his, invention, of, the, electric, battery, in, 1800, the, explorer, alexander, von, humboldt, joined, a, group, of, indigenous, people, who, went, fishing, with, horses, some, thirty, of, which, they, chased, into, the, water, the, pounding, of, the, horses, hooves, he, noted, drove, the, fish, up, to, 5, feet, 1, 5, m, long, out, of, the, mud, and, prompted, them, to, attack, rising, out, of, the, water, and, using, their, electricity, to, shock, the, horses, he, saw, two, horses, stunned, by, the, shocks, and, then, drowned, the, electric, eels, having, given, many, shocks, now, require, long, rest, and, plenty, of, nourishment, to, replace, the, loss, of, galvanic, power, they, have, suffered, swam, timidly, to, the, bank, of, the, pond, and, were, easily, caught, using, small, harpoons, on, ropes, humboldt, recorded, that, the, people, did, not, eat, the, electric, organs, and, that, they, feared, the, fish, so, much, that, they, would, not, fish, for, them, in, the, usual, way, in, 1839, the, chemist, michael, faraday, extensively, tested, the, electrical, properties, of, an, electric, eel, imported, from, surinam, for, a, span, of, four, months, he, measured, the, electrical, impulses, produced, by, the, animal, by, pressing, shaped, copper, paddles, and, saddles, against, the, specimen, through, this, method, he, determined, and, quantified, the, direction, and, magnitude, of, electric, current, and, proved, that, the, animal, s, impulses, were, electrical, by, observing, sparks, and, deflections, on, a, galvanometer, he, observed, the, electric, eel, increasing, the, shock, by, coiling, about, its, prey, the, prey, fish, representing, a, diameter, across, the, coil, he, likened, the, quantity, of, electric, charge, released, by, the, fish, to, the, electricity, of, a, leyden, battery, of, fifteen, jars, containing, 23, 000, cm, 2, 3, 500, sq, in, of, glass, coated, on, both, sides, charged, to, its, highest, degree, the, german, zoologist, carl, sachs, was, sent, to, latin, america, by, the, physiologist, emil, du, bois, reymond, to, study, the, electric, eel, he, took, with, him, a, galvanometer, and, electrodes, to, measure, the, fish, s, electric, organ, discharge, and, used, rubber, gloves, to, enable, him, to, catch, the, fish, without, being, shocked, to, the, surprise, of, the, local, people, he, published, his, research, on, the, fish, including, his, discovery, of, what, is, now, called, sachs, organ, in, 1877, the, large, quantity, of, electrocytes, available, in, the, electric, eel, enabled, biologists, to, study, the, voltage, gated, sodium, channel, in, molecular, detail, the, channel, is, an, important, mechanism, as, it, serves, to, trigger, muscle, contraction, in, many, species, but, it, is, hard, to, study, in, muscle, as, it, is, found, in, extremely, small, amounts, in, 2008, jian, xu, and, david, lavan, designed, artificial, cells, that, would, be, able, to, replicate, the, electrical, behaviour, of, electric, eel, electrocytes, the, artificial, electrocytes, would, use, a, calculated, selection, of, conductors, at, nanoscopic, scale, such, cells, would, use, ion, transport, as, electrocytes, do, with, a, greater, output, power, density, and, converting, energy, more, efficiently, they, suggest, that, such, artificial, electrocytes, could, be, developed, as, a, power, source, for, medical, implants, such, as, retinal, prostheses, and, other, microscopic, devices, they, comment, that, the, work, has, mapped, out, changes, in, the, system, level, design, of, the, electrocyte, that, could, increase, both, energy, density, and, energy, conversion, efficiency, in, 2009, they, made, synthetic, protocells, which, can, provide, about, a, twentieth, of, the, energy, density, of, a, lead, acid, battery, and, an, energy, conversion, efficiency, of, 10, in, 2016, hao, sun, and, colleagues, described, a, family, of, electric, eel, mimicking, devices, that, serve, as, high, output, voltage, electrochemical, capacitors, these, are, fabricated, as, flexible, fibres, that, can, be, woven, into, textiles, sun, and, colleagues, suggest, that, the, storage, devices, could, serve, as, power, sources, for, products, such, as, electric, watches, or, light, emitting, diodes
