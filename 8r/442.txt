caenorhabditis, elegans, s, i, n, o, r, b, d, a, t, s, l, n, s, is, a, free, living, transparent, nematode, about, 1, mm, in, length, that, lives, in, temperate, soil, environments, it, is, the, type, species, of, its, genus, the, name, is, a, blend, of, the, greek, caeno, recent, rhabditis, rod, like, and, latin, elegans, elegant, in, 1900, maupas, initially, named, it, rhabditides, elegans, osche, placed, it, in, the, subgenus, caenorhabditis, in, 1952, and, in, 1955, dougherty, raised, caenorhabditis, to, the, status, of, genus, c, elegans, is, an, unsegmented, pseudocoelomate, and, lacks, respiratory, or, circulatory, systems, most, of, these, nematodes, are, hermaphrodites, and, a, few, are, males, males, have, specialised, tails, for, mating, that, include, spicules, in, 1963, sydney, brenner, proposed, research, into, c, elegans, primarily, in, the, area, of, neuronal, development, in, 1974, he, began, research, into, the, molecular, and, developmental, biology, of, c, elegans, which, has, since, been, extensively, used, as, a, model, organism, it, was, the, first, multicellular, organism, to, have, its, whole, genome, sequenced, and, in, 2019, it, was, the, first, organism, to, have, its, connectome, neuronal, wiring, diagram, completed, c, elegans, is, unsegmented, vermiform, and, bilaterally, symmetrical, it, has, a, cuticle, a, strong, outer, covering, as, an, exoskeleton, four, main, epidermal, cords, and, a, fluid, filled, pseudocoelom, body, cavity, it, also, has, some, of, the, same, organ, systems, as, larger, animals, about, one, in, a, thousand, individuals, is, male, and, the, rest, are, hermaphrodites, the, basic, anatomy, of, c, elegans, includes, a, mouth, pharynx, intestine, gonad, and, collagenous, cuticle, like, all, nematodes, they, have, neither, a, circulatory, nor, a, respiratory, system, the, four, bands, of, muscles, that, run, the, length, of, the, body, are, connected, to, a, neural, system, that, allows, the, muscles, to, move, the, animal, s, body, only, as, dorsal, bending, or, ventral, bending, but, not, left, or, right, except, for, the, head, where, the, four, muscle, quadrants, are, wired, independently, from, one, another, when, a, wave, of, dorsal, ventral, muscle, contractions, proceeds, from, the, back, to, the, front, of, the, animal, the, animal, is, propelled, backwards, when, a, wave, of, contractions, is, initiated, at, the, front, and, proceeds, posteriorly, along, the, body, the, animal, is, propelled, forwards, because, of, this, dorsal, ventral, bias, in, body, bends, any, normal, living, moving, individual, tends, to, lie, on, either, its, left, side, or, its, right, side, when, observed, crossing, a, horizontal, surface, a, set, of, ridges, on, the, lateral, sides, of, the, body, cuticle, the, alae, is, believed, to, give, the, animal, added, traction, during, these, bending, motions, in, relation, to, lipid, metabolism, c, elegans, does, not, have, any, specialized, adipose, tissues, a, pancreas, a, liver, or, even, blood, to, deliver, nutrients, compared, to, mammals, neutral, lipids, are, instead, stored, in, the, intestine, epidermis, and, embryos, the, epidermis, corresponds, to, the, mammalian, adipocytes, by, being, the, main, triglyceride, depot, the, pharynx, is, a, muscular, food, pump, in, the, head, of, c, elegans, which, is, triangular, in, cross, section, this, grinds, food, and, transports, it, directly, to, the, intestine, a, set, of, valve, cells, connects, the, pharynx, to, the, intestine, but, how, this, valve, operates, is, not, understood, after, digestion, the, contents, of, the, intestine, are, released, via, the, rectum, as, is, the, case, with, all, other, nematodes, no, direct, connection, exists, between, the, pharynx, and, the, excretory, canal, which, functions, in, the, release, of, liquid, urine, males, have, a, single, lobed, gonad, a, vas, deferens, and, a, tail, specialized, for, mating, which, incorporates, spicules, hermaphrodites, have, two, ovaries, oviducts, and, spermatheca, and, a, single, uterus, there, are, 302, neurons, in, c, elegans, approximately, one, third, of, all, the, somatic, cells, in, the, whole, body, many, neurons, contain, dendrites, which, extend, from, the, cell, to, receive, neurotransmitters, or, other, signals, and, a, process, that, extends, to, the, nerve, ring, the, brain, for, a, synaptic, connection, with, other, neurons, c, elegans, has, excitatory, cholinergic, and, inhibitory, gabaergic, motor, neurons, which, connect, with, body, wall, muscles, to, regulate, movement, in, addition, these, neurons, and, other, neurons, such, as, interneurons, use, a, variety, of, neurotransmitters, to, control, behaviors, numerous, gut, granules, are, present, in, the, intestine, of, c, elegans, the, functions, of, which, are, still, not, fully, known, as, are, many, other, aspects, of, this, nematode, despite, the, many, years, that, it, has, been, studied, these, gut, granules, are, found, in, all, of, the, rhabditida, orders, they, are, very, similar, to, lysosomes, in, that, they, feature, an, acidic, interior, and, the, capacity, for, endocytosis, but, they, are, considerably, larger, reinforcing, the, view, of, their, being, storage, organelles, a, particular, feature, of, the, granules, is, that, when, they, are, observed, under, ultraviolet, light, they, react, by, emitting, an, intense, blue, fluorescence, another, phenomenon, seen, is, termed, death, fluorescence, as, the, worms, die, a, dramatic, burst, of, blue, fluorescence, is, emitted, this, death, fluorescence, typically, takes, place, in, an, anterior, to, posterior, wave, that, moves, along, the, intestine, and, is, seen, in, both, young, and, old, worms, whether, subjected, to, lethal, injury, or, peacefully, dying, of, old, age, many, theories, have, been, posited, on, the, functions, of, the, gut, granules, with, earlier, ones, being, eliminated, by, later, findings, they, are, thought, to, store, zinc, as, one, of, their, functions, recent, chemical, analysis, has, identified, the, blue, fluorescent, material, they, contain, as, a, glycosylated, form, of, anthranilic, acid, aa, the, need, for, the, large, amounts, of, aa, the, many, gut, granules, contain, is, questioned, one, possibility, is, that, the, aa, is, antibacterial, and, used, in, defense, against, invading, pathogens, another, possibility, is, that, the, granules, provide, photoprotection, the, bursts, of, aa, fluorescence, entail, the, conversion, of, damaging, uv, light, to, relatively, harmless, visible, light, this, is, seen, as, a, possible, link, to, the, melanin, containing, melanosomes, the, hermaphroditic, worm, is, considered, to, be, a, specialized, form, of, self, fertile, female, as, its, soma, is, female, the, hermaphroditic, germline, produces, male, gametes, first, and, lays, eggs, through, its, uterus, after, internal, fertilization, hermaphrodites, produce, all, their, sperm, in, the, l4, stage, 150, sperm, cells, per, gonadal, arm, and, then, produce, only, oocytes, the, hermaphroditic, gonad, acts, as, an, ovotestis, with, sperm, cells, being, stored, in, the, same, area, of, the, gonad, as, the, oocytes, until, the, first, oocyte, pushes, the, sperm, into, the, spermatheca, a, chamber, wherein, the, oocytes, become, fertilized, by, the, sperm, the, male, can, inseminate, the, hermaphrodite, which, will, preferentially, use, male, sperm, both, types, of, sperm, are, stored, in, the, spermatheca, the, sperm, of, c, elegans, is, amoeboid, lacking, flagella, and, acrosomes, when, self, inseminated, the, wild, type, worm, lays, about, 300, eggs, when, inseminated, by, a, male, the, number, of, progeny, can, exceed, 1, 000, hermaphrodites, do, not, typically, mate, with, other, hermaphrodites, at, 20, c, the, laboratory, strain, of, c, elegans, n2, has, an, average, lifespan, around, 2, 3, weeks, and, a, generation, time, of, 3, to, 4, days, c, elegans, has, five, pairs, of, autosomes, and, one, pair, of, sex, chromosomes, sex, in, c, elegans, is, based, on, an, x0, sex, determination, system, hermaphrodites, of, c, elegans, have, a, matched, pair, of, sex, chromosomes, xx, the, rare, males, have, only, one, sex, chromosome, x0, c, elegans, are, mostly, hermaphroditic, organisms, producing, both, sperms, and, oocytes, males, do, occur, in, the, population, in, a, rate, of, approximately, 1, in, 200, hermaphrodites, but, the, two, sexes, are, highly, differentiated, males, differ, from, their, hermaphroditic, counterparts, in, that, they, are, smaller, and, can, be, identified, through, the, shape, of, their, tail, c, elegans, reproduce, through, a, process, called, androdioecy, this, means, that, they, can, reproduce, in, two, ways, either, through, self, fertilization, in, hermaphrodites, or, through, hermaphrodites, breeding, with, males, males, are, produced, through, non, disjunction, of, the, x, chromosomes, during, meiosis, the, worms, that, reproduce, through, self, fertilization, are, at, risk, for, high, linkage, disequilibrium, which, leads, to, lower, genetic, diversity, in, populations, and, an, increase, in, accumulation, of, deleterious, alleles, in, c, elegans, somatic, sex, determination, is, attributed, to, the, tra, 1, gene, the, tra, 1, is, a, gene, within, the, tra, 1, transcription, factor, sex, determination, pathway, that, is, regulated, post, transcriptionally, and, works, by, promoting, female, development, in, hermaphrodites, xx, there, are, high, levels, of, tra, 1, activity, which, produces, the, female, reproductive, system, and, inhibits, male, development, at, a, certain, time, in, their, life, cycle, one, day, before, adulthood, hermaphrodites, can, be, identified, through, the, addition, of, a, vulva, near, their, tail, in, males, xo, there, are, low, levels, of, tra, 1, activity, resulting, in, a, male, reproductive, system, recent, research, has, shown, that, there, are, three, other, genes, fem, 1, fem, 2, and, fem, 3, that, negatively, regulate, the, tra, 1, pathway, and, act, as, the, final, determiner, of, sex, in, c, elegans, the, sex, determination, system, in, c, elegans, is, a, topic, that, has, been, of, interest, to, scientists, for, years, since, they, are, used, as, a, model, organism, any, information, discovered, about, the, way, their, sex, determination, system, might, have, evolved, could, further, the, same, evolutionary, biology, research, in, other, organisms, after, almost, 30, years, of, research, scientists, have, begun, to, put, together, the, pieces, in, the, evolution, of, such, a, system, what, they, have, discovered, is, that, there, is, a, complex, pathway, involved, that, has, several, layers, of, regulation, the, closely, related, organism, caenorhabditis, briggsae, has, been, studied, extensively, and, its, whole, genome, sequence, has, helped, put, together, the, missing, pieces, in, the, evolution, of, c, elegans, sex, determination, it, has, been, discovered, that, two, genes, have, assimilated, leading, to, the, proteins, xol, 1, and, mix, 1, having, an, effect, on, sex, determination, in, c, elegans, as, well, mutations, in, the, xol, 1, pathway, leads, to, feminization, in, c, elegans, the, mix, 1, gene, is, known, to, hypoactivate, the, x, chromosome, and, regulates, the, morphology, of, the, male, tail, in, c, elegans, looking, at, the, nematode, as, a, whole, the, male, and, hermaphrodite, sex, likely, evolved, from, parallel, evolution, parallel, evolution, is, defined, as, similar, traits, evolving, from, an, ancestor, in, similar, conditions, simply, put, the, two, species, evolve, in, similar, ways, over, time, an, example, of, this, would, be, marsupial, and, placental, mammals, scientists, have, also, hypothesized, that, hermaphrodite, asexual, reproduction, or, selfing, could, have, evolved, convergently, by, studying, species, similar, to, c, elegans, other, studies, on, the, sex, determination, evolution, suggest, that, genes, involving, sperm, evolve, at, the, faster, rate, than, female, genes, however, sperm, genes, on, the, x, chromosome, have, reduced, evolution, rates, sperm, genes, have, short, coding, sequences, high, codon, bias, and, disproportionate, representation, among, orphan, genes, these, characteristics, of, sperm, genes, may, be, the, reason, for, their, high, rates, of, evolution, and, may, also, suggest, how, sperm, genes, evolved, out, of, hermaphrodite, worms, overall, scientists, have, a, general, idea, of, the, sex, determination, pathway, in, c, elegans, however, the, evolution, of, how, this, pathway, came, to, be, is, not, yet, well, defined, the, fertilized, zygote, undergoes, rotational, holoblastic, cleavage, sperm, entry, into, the, oocyte, commences, formation, of, an, anterior, posterior, axis, the, sperm, microtubule, organizing, center, directs, the, movement, of, the, sperm, pronucleus, to, the, future, posterior, pole, of, the, embryo, while, also, inciting, the, movement, of, par, proteins, a, group, of, cytoplasmic, determination, factors, to, their, proper, respective, locations, as, a, result, of, the, difference, in, par, protein, distribution, the, first, cell, division, is, highly, asymmetric, c, elegans, embryogenesis, is, among, the, best, understood, examples, of, asymmetric, cell, division, all, cells, of, the, germline, arise, from, a, single, primordial, germ, cell, called, the, p4, cell, established, early, in, embryogenesis, this, primordial, cell, divides, to, generate, two, germline, precursors, that, do, not, divide, further, until, after, hatching, the, resulting, daughter, cells, of, the, first, cell, division, are, called, the, ab, cell, containing, par, 6, and, par, 3, and, the, p1, cell, containing, par, 1, and, par, 2, a, second, cell, division, produces, the, abp, and, aba, cells, from, the, ab, cell, and, the, ems, and, p2, cells, from, the, p1, cell, this, division, establishes, the, dorsal, ventral, axis, with, the, abp, cell, forming, the, dorsal, side, and, the, ems, cell, marking, the, ventral, side, through, wnt, signaling, the, p2, cell, instructs, the, ems, cell, to, divide, along, the, anterior, posterior, axis, through, notch, signaling, the, p2, cell, differentially, specifies, the, abp, and, aba, cells, which, further, defines, the, dorsal, ventral, axis, the, left, right, axis, also, becomes, apparent, early, in, embryogenesis, although, it, is, unclear, exactly, when, specifically, the, axis, is, determined, however, most, theories, of, the, l, r, axis, development, involve, some, kind, of, differences, in, cells, derived, from, the, ab, cell, gastrulation, occurs, after, the, embryo, reaches, the, 24, cell, stage, c, elegans, are, a, species, of, protostomes, so, the, blastopore, eventually, forms, the, mouth, involution, into, the, blastopore, begins, with, movement, of, the, endoderm, cells, and, subsequent, formation, of, the, gut, followed, by, the, p4, germline, precursor, and, finally, the, mesoderm, cells, including, the, cells, that, eventually, form, the, pharynx, gastrulation, ends, when, epiboly, of, the, hypoblasts, closes, the, blastopore, under, environmental, conditions, favourable, for, reproduction, hatched, larvae, develop, through, four, larval, stages, l1, l2, l3, and, l4, in, just, 3, days, at, 20, c, when, conditions, are, stressed, as, in, food, insufficiency, excessive, population, density, or, high, temperature, c, elegans, can, enter, an, alternative, third, larval, stage, l2d, called, the, dauer, stage, dauer, is, german, for, permanent, a, specific, dauer, pheromone, regulates, entry, into, the, dauer, state, this, pheromone, is, composed, of, similar, derivatives, of, the, 3, 6, dideoxy, sugar, ascarylose, ascarosides, named, after, the, ascarylose, base, are, involved, in, many, sex, specific, and, social, behaviors, in, this, way, they, constitute, a, chemical, language, that, c, elegans, uses, to, modulate, various, phenotypes, dauer, larvae, are, stress, resistant, they, are, thin, and, their, mouths, are, sealed, with, a, characteristic, dauer, cuticle, and, cannot, take, in, food, they, can, remain, in, this, stage, for, a, few, months, the, stage, ends, when, conditions, improve, favour, further, growth, of, the, larva, now, moulting, into, the, l4, stage, even, though, the, gonad, development, is, arrested, at, the, l2, stage, each, stage, transition, is, punctuated, by, a, molt, of, the, worm, s, transparent, cuticle, transitions, through, these, stages, are, controlled, by, genes, of, the, heterochronic, pathway, an, evolutionarily, conserved, set, of, regulatory, factors, many, heterochronic, genes, code, for, micrornas, which, repress, the, expression, of, heterochronic, transcription, factors, and, other, heterochronic, mirnas, mirnas, were, originally, discovered, in, c, elegans, important, developmental, events, controlled, by, heterochronic, genes, include, the, division, and, eventual, syncitial, fusion, of, the, hypodermic, seam, cells, and, their, subsequent, secretion, of, the, alae, in, young, adults, it, is, believed, that, the, heterochronic, pathway, represents, an, evolutionarily, conserved, predecessor, to, circadian, clocks, some, nematodes, have, a, fixed, genetically, determined, number, of, cells, a, phenomenon, known, as, eutely, the, adult, c, elegans, hermaphrodite, has, 959, somatic, cells, and, the, male, has, 1033, cells, although, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, number, of, their, intestinal, cells, can, increase, by, one, to, three, in, response, to, gut, microbes, experienced, by, mothers, much, of, the, literature, describes, the, cell, number, in, males, as, 1031, but, the, discovery, of, a, pair, of, left, and, right, mcm, neurons, increased, the, number, by, two, in, 2015, the, number, of, cells, does, not, change, after, cell, division, ceases, at, the, end, of, the, larval, period, and, subsequent, growth, is, due, solely, to, an, increase, in, the, size, of, individual, cells, the, different, caenorhabditis, species, occupy, various, nutrient, and, bacteria, rich, environments, they, feed, on, the, bacteria, that, develop, in, decaying, organic, matter, microbivory, they, possess, chemosensory, receptors, which, enable, the, detection, of, bacteria, and, bacterial, secreted, metabolites, such, as, iron, siderophores, so, that, they, can, migrate, towards, their, bacterial, prey, soil, lacks, enough, organic, matter, to, support, self, sustaining, populations, c, elegans, can, survive, on, a, diet, of, a, variety, of, bacteria, but, its, wild, ecology, is, largely, unknown, most, laboratory, strains, were, taken, from, artificial, environments, such, as, gardens, and, compost, piles, more, recently, c, elegans, has, been, found, to, thrive, in, other, kinds, of, organic, matter, particularly, rotting, fruit, c, elegans, can, also, ingest, pollutants, especially, tiny, nanoplastics, which, could, enable, the, association, with, antibiotic, resistant, bacteria, resulting, in, the, dissemination, of, nanoplastics, and, antibiotic, resistant, bacteria, by, c, elegans, across, the, soil, c, elegans, can, also, use, different, species, of, yeast, including, cryptococcus, laurentii, and, c, kuetzingii, as, sole, sources, of, food, although, a, bacterivore, c, elegans, can, be, killed, by, a, number, of, pathogenic, bacteria, including, human, pathogens, such, as, staphylococcus, aureus, pseudomonas, aeruginosa, salmonella, enterica, or, enterococcus, faecalis, pathogenic, bacteria, can, also, form, biofilms, whose, sticky, exopolymer, matrix, could, impede, c, elegans, motility, and, cloaks, bacterial, quorum, sensing, chemoattractants, from, predator, detection, invertebrates, such, as, millipedes, insects, isopods, and, gastropods, can, transport, dauer, larvae, to, various, suitable, locations, the, larvae, have, also, been, seen, to, feed, on, their, hosts, when, they, die, nematodes, can, survive, desiccation, and, in, c, elegans, the, mechanism, for, this, capability, has, been, demonstrated, to, be, late, embryogenesis, abundant, proteins, c, elegans, as, other, nematodes, can, be, eaten, by, predator, nematodes, and, other, omnivores, including, some, insects, the, orsay, virus, is, a, virus, that, affects, c, elegans, as, well, as, the, caenorhabditis, elegans, cer1, virus, and, the, caenorhabditis, elegans, cer13, virus, wild, isolates, of, caenorhabditis, elegans, are, regularly, found, with, infections, by, microsporidia, fungi, one, such, species, nematocida, parisii, replicates, in, the, intestines, of, c, elegans, arthrobotrys, oligospora, is, the, model, organism, for, interactions, between, fungi, and, nematodes, it, is, the, most, common, and, widespread, nematode, capturing, fungus, in, 1963, sydney, brenner, proposed, using, c, elegans, as, a, model, organism, for, the, investigation, primarily, of, neural, development, in, animals, it, is, one, of, the, simplest, organisms, with, a, nervous, system, the, neurons, do, not, fire, action, potentials, and, do, not, express, any, voltage, gated, sodium, channels, in, the, hermaphrodite, this, system, comprises, 302, neurons, the, pattern, of, which, has, been, comprehensively, mapped, in, what, is, known, as, a, connectome, and, shown, to, be, a, small, world, network, research, has, explored, the, neural, and, molecular, mechanisms, that, control, several, behaviors, of, c, elegans, including, chemotaxis, thermotaxis, mechanotransduction, learning, memory, and, mating, behaviour, in, 2019, the, connectome, of, the, male, was, published, using, a, technique, distinct, from, that, used, for, the, hermaphrodite, the, same, paper, used, the, new, technique, to, redo, the, hermaphrodite, connectome, finding, 1, 500, new, synapses, it, has, been, used, as, a, model, organism, to, study, molecular, mechanisms, in, metabolic, diseases, brenner, also, chose, it, as, it, is, easy, to, grow, in, bulk, populations, and, convenient, for, genetic, analysis, it, is, a, multicellular, eukaryotic, organism, yet, simple, enough, to, be, studied, in, great, detail, the, transparency, of, c, elegans, facilitates, the, study, of, cellular, differentiation, and, other, developmental, processes, in, the, intact, organism, the, spicules, in, the, male, clearly, distinguish, males, from, females, strains, are, cheap, to, breed, and, can, be, frozen, when, subsequently, thawed, they, remain, viable, allowing, long, term, storage, maintenance, is, easy, when, compared, to, other, multicellular, model, organisms, a, few, hundred, nematodes, can, be, kept, on, a, single, agar, plate, and, suitable, growth, medium, brenner, described, the, use, of, a, mutant, of, e, coli, op50, op50, is, a, uracil, requiring, organism, and, its, deficiency, in, the, plate, prevents, the, overgrowth, of, bacteria, which, would, obscure, the, worms, the, use, of, op50, does, not, demand, any, major, laboratory, safety, measures, since, it, is, non, pathogenic, and, easily, grown, in, luria, bertani, lb, media, overnight, the, developmental, fate, of, every, single, somatic, cell, 959, in, the, adult, hermaphrodite, 1031, in, the, adult, male, has, been, mapped, these, patterns, of, cell, lineage, are, largely, invariant, between, individuals, whereas, in, mammals, cell, development, is, more, dependent, on, cellular, cues, from, the, embryo, as, mentioned, previously, the, first, cell, divisions, of, early, embryogenesis, in, c, elegans, are, among, the, best, understood, examples, of, asymmetric, cell, divisions, and, the, worm, is, a, very, popular, model, system, for, studying, developmental, biology, programmed, cell, death, apoptosis, eliminates, many, additional, cells, 131, in, the, hermaphrodite, most, of, which, would, otherwise, become, neurons, this, apoptotic, predictability, has, contributed, to, the, elucidation, of, some, apoptotic, genes, cell, death, promoting, genes, and, a, single, cell, death, inhibitor, have, been, identified, rna, interference, rnai, is, a, relatively, straightforward, method, of, disrupting, the, function, of, specific, genes, silencing, the, function, of, a, gene, can, sometimes, allow, a, researcher, to, infer, its, possible, function, the, nematode, can, be, soaked, in, injected, with, or, fed, with, genetically, transformed, bacteria, that, express, the, double, stranded, rna, of, interest, the, sequence, of, which, complements, the, sequence, of, the, gene, that, the, researcher, wishes, to, disable, rnai, has, emerged, as, a, powerful, tool, in, the, study, of, functional, genomics, c, elegans, has, been, used, to, analyse, gene, functions, and, claim, the, promise, of, future, findings, in, the, systematic, genetic, interactions, environmental, rnai, uptake, is, much, worse, in, other, species, of, worms, in, the, genus, caenorhabditis, although, injecting, rna, into, the, body, cavity, of, the, animal, induces, gene, silencing, in, most, species, only, c, elegans, and, a, few, other, distantly, related, nematodes, can, take, up, rna, from, the, bacteria, they, eat, for, rnai, this, ability, has, been, mapped, down, to, a, single, gene, sid, 2, which, when, inserted, as, a, transgene, in, other, species, allows, them, to, take, up, rna, for, rnai, as, c, elegans, does, research, into, meiosis, has, been, considerably, simplified, since, every, germ, cell, nucleus, is, at, the, same, given, position, as, it, moves, down, the, gonad, so, is, at, the, same, stage, in, meiosis, in, an, early, phase, of, meiosis, the, oocytes, become, extremely, resistant, to, radiation, and, this, resistance, depends, on, expression, of, genes, rad51, and, atm, that, have, key, roles, in, recombinational, repair, gene, mre, 11, also, plays, a, crucial, role, in, recombinational, repair, of, dna, damage, during, meiosis, a, study, of, the, frequency, of, outcrossing, in, natural, populations, showed, that, selfing, is, the, predominant, mode, of, reproduction, in, c, elegans, but, that, infrequent, outcrossing, events, occur, at, a, rate, around, 1, meioses, that, result, in, selfing, are, unlikely, to, contribute, significantly, to, beneficial, genetic, variability, but, these, meioses, may, provide, the, adaptive, benefit, of, recombinational, repair, of, dna, damages, that, arise, especially, under, stressful, conditions, nicotine, dependence, can, also, be, studied, using, c, elegans, because, it, exhibits, behavioral, responses, to, nicotine, that, parallel, those, of, mammals, these, responses, include, acute, response, tolerance, withdrawal, and, sensitization, as, for, most, model, organisms, scientists, that, work, in, the, field, curate, a, dedicated, online, database, and, wormbase, is, that, for, c, elegans, the, wormbase, attempts, to, collate, all, published, information, on, c, elegans, and, other, related, nematodes, information, on, c, elegans, is, included, with, data, on, other, model, organisms, in, the, alliance, of, genome, resources, c, elegans, has, been, a, model, organism, for, research, into, ageing, for, example, the, inhibition, of, an, insulin, like, growth, factor, signaling, pathway, has, been, shown, to, increase, adult, lifespan, threefold, while, glucose, feeding, promotes, oxidative, stress, and, reduce, adult, lifespan, by, a, half, similarly, induced, degradation, of, an, insulin, igf, 1, receptor, late, in, life, extended, life, expectancy, of, worms, dramatically, long, lived, mutants, of, c, elegans, were, demonstrated, to, be, resistant, to, oxidative, stress, and, uv, light, these, long, lived, mutants, had, a, higher, dna, repair, capability, than, wild, type, c, elegans, knockdown, of, the, nucleotide, excision, repair, gene, xpa, 1, increased, sensitivity, to, uv, and, reduced, the, life, span, of, the, long, lived, mutants, these, findings, indicate, that, dna, repair, capability, underlies, longevity, the, capacity, to, repair, dna, damage, by, the, process, of, nucleotide, excision, repair, declines, with, age, c, elegans, exposed, to, 5mm, lithium, chloride, licl, showed, lengthened, life, spans, when, exposed, to, 10, m, licl, reduced, mortality, was, observed, but, not, with, 1, m, c, elegans, has, been, instrumental, in, the, identification, of, the, functions, of, genes, implicated, in, alzheimer, s, disease, such, as, presenilin, moreover, extensive, research, on, c, elegans, has, identified, rna, binding, proteins, as, essential, factors, during, germline, and, early, embryonic, development, telomeres, the, length, of, which, have, been, shown, to, correlate, with, increased, lifespan, and, delayed, onset, of, senescence, in, a, multitude, of, organisms, from, c, elegans, to, humans, show, an, interesting, behaviour, in, c, elegans, while, c, elegans, maintains, its, telomeres, in, a, canonical, way, similar, to, other, eukaryotes, in, contrast, drosophila, melanogaster, is, noteworthy, in, its, use, of, retrotransposons, to, maintain, its, telomeres, during, knock, out, of, the, catalytic, subunit, of, the, telomerase, trt, 1, c, elegans, can, gain, the, ability, of, alternative, telomere, lengthening, alt, c, elegans, was, the, first, eukaryote, to, gain, alt, functionality, after, knock, out, of, the, canonical, telomerase, pathway, alt, is, also, observed, in, about, 10, 15, of, all, clinical, cancers, thus, c, elegans, is, a, prime, candidate, for, alt, research, bayat, et, al, showed, the, paradoxical, shortening, of, telomeres, during, trt, 1, over, expression, which, lead, to, near, sterility, while, the, worms, even, exhibited, a, slight, increase, in, lifespan, despite, shortened, telomeres, c, elegans, is, notable, in, animal, sleep, studies, as, the, most, primitive, organism, to, display, sleep, like, states, in, c, elegans, a, lethargus, phase, occurs, shortly, before, each, moult, c, elegans, has, also, been, demonstrated, to, sleep, after, exposure, to, physical, stress, including, heat, shock, uv, radiation, and, bacterial, toxins, while, the, worm, has, no, eyes, it, has, been, found, to, be, sensitive, to, light, due, to, a, third, type, of, light, sensitive, animal, photoreceptor, protein, lite, 1, which, is, 10, to, 100, times, more, efficient, at, absorbing, light, than, the, other, two, types, of, photopigments, opsins, and, cryptochromes, found, in, the, animal, kingdom, c, elegans, is, remarkably, adept, at, tolerating, acceleration, it, can, withstand, 400, 000, g, s, according, to, geneticists, at, the, university, of, s, o, paulo, in, brazil, in, an, experiment, 96, of, them, were, still, alive, without, adverse, effects, after, an, hour, in, an, ultracentrifuge, c, elegans, made, news, when, specimens, were, discovered, to, have, survived, the, space, shuttle, columbia, disaster, in, february, 2003, later, in, january, 2009, live, samples, of, c, elegans, from, the, university, of, nottingham, were, announced, to, be, spending, two, weeks, on, the, international, space, station, that, october, in, a, space, research, project, to, explore, the, effects, of, zero, gravity, on, muscle, development, and, physiology, the, research, was, primarily, about, genetic, basis, of, muscle, atrophy, which, relates, to, spaceflight, or, being, bed, ridden, geriatric, or, diabetic, descendants, of, the, worms, aboard, columbia, in, 2003, were, launched, into, space, on, endeavour, for, the, sts, 134, mission, additional, experiments, on, muscle, dystrophy, during, spaceflight, were, carried, on, board, the, iss, starting, in, 2018, it, was, shown, that, the, genes, affecting, muscles, attachment, were, expressed, less, in, space, however, it, has, yet, to, be, seen, if, this, affects, muscle, strength, c, elegans, was, the, first, multicellular, organism, to, have, its, whole, genome, sequenced, the, sequence, was, published, in, 1998, although, some, small, gaps, were, present, the, last, gap, was, finished, by, october, 2002, in, the, run, up, to, the, whole, genome, the, c, elegans, sequencing, consortium, c, elegans, genome, project, released, several, partial, scans, including, wilson, et, al, 1994, the, c, elegans, genome, is, about, 100, million, base, pairs, long, and, consists, of, six, pairs, of, chromosomes, in, hermaphrodites, or, five, pairs, of, autosomes, with, xo, chromosome, in, male, c, elegans, and, a, mitochondrial, genome, its, gene, density, is, about, one, gene, per, five, kilo, base, pairs, introns, make, up, 26, and, intergenic, regions, 47, of, the, genome, many, genes, are, arranged, in, clusters, and, how, many, of, these, are, operons, is, unclear, c, elegans, and, other, nematodes, are, among, the, few, eukaryotes, currently, known, to, have, operons, these, include, trypanosomes, flatworms, notably, the, trematode, schistosoma, mansoni, and, a, primitive, chordate, tunicate, oikopleura, dioica, many, more, organisms, are, likely, to, be, shown, to, have, these, operons, the, genome, contains, an, estimated, 20, 470, protein, coding, genes, about, 35, of, c, elegans, genes, have, human, homologs, remarkably, human, genes, have, been, shown, repeatedly, to, replace, their, c, elegans, homologs, when, introduced, into, c, elegans, conversely, many, c, elegans, genes, can, function, similarly, to, mammalian, genes, the, number, of, known, rna, genes, in, the, genome, has, increased, greatly, due, to, the, 2006, discovery, of, a, new, class, called, 21u, rna, genes, and, the, genome, is, now, believed, to, contain, more, than, 16, 000, rna, genes, up, from, as, few, as, 1, 300, in, 2005, scientific, curators, continue, to, appraise, the, set, of, known, genes, new, gene, models, continue, to, be, added, and, incorrect, ones, modified, or, removed, the, reference, c, elegans, genome, sequence, continues, to, change, as, new, evidence, reveals, errors, in, the, original, sequencing, most, changes, are, minor, adding, or, removing, only, a, few, base, pairs, of, dna, for, example, the, ws202, release, of, wormbase, april, 2009, added, two, base, pairs, to, the, genome, sequence, sometimes, more, extensive, changes, are, made, as, noted, in, the, ws197, release, of, december, 2008, which, added, a, region, of, over, 4, 300, bp, to, the, sequence, the, c, elegans, genome, project, s, wilson, et, al, 1994, found, celvav, and, a, von, willebrand, factor, a, domain, and, with, wilson, et, al, 1998, provides, the, first, credible, evidence, for, an, aryl, hydrocarbon, receptor, ahr, homolog, outside, of, vertebrates, 2, in, 2003, the, genome, sequence, of, the, related, nematode, c, briggsae, was, also, determined, allowing, researchers, to, study, the, comparative, genomics, of, these, two, organisms, the, genome, sequences, of, more, nematodes, from, the, same, genus, e, g, c, remanei, c, japonica, and, c, brenneri, named, after, brenner, have, also, been, studied, using, the, shotgun, sequencing, technique, these, sequences, have, now, been, completed, as, of, 2014, c, elegans, is, the, most, basal, species, in, the, elegans, group, 10, species, of, the, elegans, supergroup, 17, species, in, phylogenetic, studies, it, forms, a, branch, of, its, own, distinct, to, any, other, species, of, the, group, tc1, transposon, is, a, dna, transposon, active, in, c, elegans, in, 2002, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, was, awarded, to, sydney, brenner, h, robert, horvitz, and, john, sulston, for, their, work, on, the, genetics, of, organ, development, and, programmed, cell, death, in, c, elegans, the, 2006, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, was, awarded, to, andrew, fire, and, craig, c, mello, for, their, discovery, of, rna, interference, in, c, elegans, in, 2008, martin, chalfie, shared, a, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, work, on, green, fluorescent, protein, some, of, the, research, involved, the, use, of, c, elegans, many, scientists, who, research, c, elegans, closely, connect, to, sydney, brenner, with, whom, almost, all, research, in, this, field, began, in, the, 1970s, they, have, worked, as, either, a, postdoctoral, or, a, postgraduate, researcher, in, brenner, s, lab, or, in, the, lab, of, someone, who, previously, worked, with, brenner, most, who, worked, in, his, lab, later, established, their, own, worm, research, labs, thereby, creating, a, fairly, well, documented, lineage, of, c, elegans, scientists, which, was, recorded, into, the, wormbase, database, in, some, detail, at, the, 2003, international, worm, meeting
