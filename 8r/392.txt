a, crane, fly, is, any, member, of, the, dipteran, superfamily, tipuloidea, which, contains, the, living, families, cylindrotomidae, limoniidae, pediciidae, and, tipulidae, as, well, as, several, extinct, families, winter, crane, flies, members, of, the, family, trichoceridae, are, sufficiently, different, from, the, typical, crane, flies, of, tipuloidea, to, be, excluded, from, the, superfamily, tipuloidea, and, are, placed, as, their, sister, group, within, tipulomorpha, the, classification, of, crane, flies, has, been, varied, in, the, past, with, some, or, all, of, these, families, treated, as, subfamilies, but, the, following, classification, is, currently, accepted, species, counts, are, approximate, and, vary, over, time, in, colloquial, speech, crane, flies, are, known, as, mosquito, hawks, or, skeeter, eaters, though, they, do, not, actually, prey, on, adult, mosquitos, or, other, insects, they, are, also, sometimes, called, daddy, longlegs, a, name, which, is, also, used, for, arachnids, of, the, family, pholcidae, and, the, order, opiliones, the, larvae, of, crane, flies, are, known, commonly, as, leatherjackets, crane, flies, first, appeared, during, the, middle, triassic, around, 245, million, years, ago, making, them, one, of, the, oldest, known, groups, of, flies, and, are, found, worldwide, though, individual, species, usually, have, limited, ranges, they, are, most, diverse, in, the, tropics, but, are, also, common, in, northern, latitudes, and, high, elevations, more, than, 15, 500, species, and, over, 500, genera, of, crane, flies, have, been, described, the, majority, by, charles, paul, alexander, who, published, descriptions, of, 10, 890, new, species, and, subspecies, and, 256, new, genera, and, subgenera, over, a, period, of, 71, years, from, 1910, to, 1981, an, adult, crane, fly, resembling, an, oversized, male, mosquito, typically, has, a, slender, body, and, long, stilt, like, legs, that, are, deciduous, easily, coming, off, the, body, like, other, insects, their, wings, are, marked, with, wing, interference, patterns, which, vary, among, species, thus, are, useful, for, species, identification, they, occur, in, moist, temperate, environments, such, as, vegetation, near, lakes, and, streams, they, generally, do, not, feed, but, some, species, consume, nectar, pollen, and, or, water, the, wingspan, is, generally, about, 1, 0, to, 6, 5, cm, 1, 2, to, 2, 1, 2, in, though, some, species, of, holorusia, can, reach, 11, cm, 4, 1, 4, in, the, antennae, have, up, to, 19, segments, it, is, also, characterized, by, a, v, shaped, suture, or, groove, on, the, back, of, the, thorax, mesonotum, and, by, its, wing, venation, the, rostrum, is, long, and, in, some, species, as, long, as, the, head, and, thorax, together, larvae, occur, in, various, habitats, including, marshes, springs, decaying, wood, moist, soil, leaf, litter, fungi, vertebrate, nests, and, vegetation, they, usually, feed, on, decaying, plant, matter, and, microbes, associated, with, this, but, some, species, instead, feed, on, living, plants, fungi, or, other, invertebrates, tipuloidea, are, medium, to, large, sized, flies, 7, 35, mm, 1, 4, 1, 1, 2, in, with, elongated, legs, wings, and, abdomen, their, colour, is, yellow, brown, or, grey, ocelli, are, absent, the, rostrum, a, snout, is, short, to, very, short, with, a, beak, like, point, called, the, nasus, rarely, absent, the, apical, segment, of, the, maxillary, palpi, is, flagelliform, whip, like, and, much, longer, than, the, subapical, segment, the, antennae, have, 13, segments, exceptionally, 14, 19, these, are, whorled, serrate, or, ctenidial, comb, like, there, is, a, distinct, v, shaped, suture, between, the, mesonotal, prescutum, and, scutum, near, the, level, of, the, wing, bases, the, wings, are, monochromatic, longitudinally, striped, or, marbled, in, females, the, wings, are, sometimes, rudimentary, the, sub, costal, vein, sc, joins, through, sc2, with, the, radial, vein, sc1, is, at, most, a, short, stump, there, are, four, rarely, when, r2, is, reduced, three, branches, of, the, radial, vein, merging, into, the, alar, margin, the, discoidal, wing, cell, is, usually, present, the, wing, has, two, anal, veins, sternite, 9, of, the, male, genitalia, has, with, few, exceptions, two, pairs, of, appendages, sometimes, appendages, are, also, present, on, sternite, 8, the, female, ovipositor, has, sclerotized, valves, and, the, cerci, have, a, smooth, or, dentate, lower, margin, the, valves, are, sometimes, modified, into, thick, bristles, or, short, teeth, the, larva, is, elongated, usually, cylindrical, the, posterior, two, thirds, of, the, head, capsule, is, enclosed, or, retracted, within, the, prothoracic, segment, the, larva, is, metapneustic, with, only, one, pair, of, spiracles, these, on, the, anal, segment, of, the, abdomen, but, often, with, vestigial, lateral, spiracles, rarely, apneustic, the, head, capsule, is, sclerotized, anteriorly, and, deeply, incised, ventrally, and, often, dorsolaterally, the, mandibles, are, opposed, and, move, in, the, horizontal, or, oblique, plane, the, abdominal, segments, have, transverse, creeping, welts, the, terminal, segments, of, the, abdomen, are, glabrous, often, partially, sclerotized, and, bearing, posterior, spiracles, the, spiracular, disc, is, usually, surrounded, by, lobe, like, projections, and, anal, papillae, or, lobes, adults, have, a, lifespan, of, 10, to, 15, days, the, adult, female, usually, contains, mature, eggs, as, she, emerges, from, her, pupa, and, often, mates, immediately, if, a, male, is, available, males, also, search, for, females, by, walking, or, flying, copulation, takes, a, few, minutes, to, hours, and, may, be, accomplished, in, flight, the, female, immediately, oviposits, usually, in, wet, soil, or, mats, of, algae, some, lay, eggs, on, the, surface, of, a, water, body, or, in, dry, soils, and, some, reportedly, simply, drop, them, in, flight, most, crane, fly, eggs, are, black, in, color, they, often, have, a, filament, which, may, help, anchor, the, egg, in, wet, or, aquatic, environments, crane, fly, larvae, leatherjackets, have, been, observed, in, many, habitat, types, on, dry, land, and, in, water, including, marine, brackish, and, fresh, water, they, are, cylindrical, in, shape, but, taper, toward, the, front, end, and, the, head, capsule, is, often, retracted, into, the, thorax, the, abdomen, may, be, smooth, lined, with, hairs, or, studded, with, projections, or, welt, like, spots, projections, may, occur, around, the, spiracles, larvae, may, eat, algae, microflora, and, living, or, decomposing, plant, matter, including, wood, some, are, predatory, larval, habitats, include, all, kinds, of, freshwater, semiaquatic, environments, some, tipuloidea, including, dolichopeza, are, found, in, moist, to, wet, cushions, of, mosses, or, liverworts, ctenophora, species, are, found, in, decaying, wood, or, sodden, logs, nephrotoma, and, tipula, larvae, are, found, in, dry, soils, of, pasturelands, lawns, and, steppe, tipuloidea, larvae, are, also, found, in, rich, organic, earth, and, mud, in, wet, spots, in, woods, where, the, humus, is, saturated, in, leaf, litter, or, mud, decaying, plant, materials, or, fruits, in, various, stages, of, putrefaction, larvae, can, be, important, in, the, soil, ecosystem, because, they, process, organic, material, and, increase, microbial, activity, larvae, and, adults, are, also, valuable, prey, items, for, many, animals, including, insects, spiders, fish, amphibians, birds, and, mammals, adult, crane, flies, may, be, used, for, transport, by, aquatic, species, of, the, mite, family, ascidae, this, is, known, as, phoresis, some, members, of, the, tipulid, genus, tipula, such, as, the, european, crane, fly, tipula, paludosa, and, the, marsh, crane, fly, t, oleracea, are, agricultural, pests, in, europe, the, larvae, of, these, species, live, in, the, top, layers, of, soil, where, they, feed, on, the, roots, root, hairs, crown, and, sometimes, the, leaves, of, crops, stunting, their, growth, or, killing, the, plants, they, are, pests, on, a, variety, of, commodities, since, the, late, 1900s, t, paludosa, and, t, oleracea, have, become, invasive, in, the, united, states, the, larvae, have, been, observed, on, many, crops, including, vegetables, fruits, cereals, pasture, lawn, grasses, and, ornamental, plants, in, 1935, lord, s, cricket, ground, in, london, was, among, venues, affected, by, leatherjackets, several, thousand, were, collected, by, ground, staff, and, burned, because, they, caused, bald, patches, on, the, pitch, and, the, pitch, took, unaccustomed, spin, for, much, of, the, season, the, phylogenetic, position, of, the, tipuloidea, remains, uncertain, the, classical, viewpoint, that, they, are, an, early, branch, of, diptera, perhaps, with, the, trichoceridae, the, sister, group, of, all, other, diptera, is, giving, way, to, modern, views, that, they, are, more, highly, derived, this, is, thanks, to, evidence, from, molecular, studies, which, is, consistent, with, the, more, derived, larval, characters, similar, to, those, of, higher, diptera, the, pediciidae, and, tipulidae, are, sister, groups, the, limoniids, are, a, paraphyletic, clade, specifically, limoniidae, has, recently, been, treated, by, numerous, authors, at, the, rank, of, family, but, subsequent, phylogenetic, analyses, revealed, that, the, remaining, groups, of, tipulids, render, the, group, paraphyletic, the, cylindrotomidae, appear, to, be, a, relict, group, that, was, much, better, represented, in, the, tertiary, tipulidae, probably, evolved, from, ancestors, in, the, upper, jurassic, the, architipulidae, and, representatives, of, the, limoniidae, are, known, from, the, upper, triassic, numerous, common, names, have, been, applied, to, the, crane, fly, many, of, the, names, are, more, or, less, regional, in, the, u, s, including, mosquito, hawk, mosquito, eater, gallinipper, and, gollywhopper, they, are, also, known, as, daddy, longlegs, in, english, speaking, countries, outside, the, u, s, not, to, be, confused, with, the, u, s, usages, of, daddy, long, legs, that, refer, to, either, arachnids, of, the, order, opiliones, or, the, family, pholcidae, the, larvae, of, crane, flies, are, known, commonly, as, leatherjackets, they, are, also, known, as, jenny, long, legs, in, scotland, in, ireland, they, are, generally, called, daddy, long, legs, in, english, whereas, in, irish, they, are, commonly, known, as, pilib, an, gheataire, which, means, skinny, philip, there, is, an, enduring, urban, legend, that, crane, flies, are, the, most, venomous, insects, in, the, world, however, they, have, neither, venom, nor, the, ability, to, bite, the, myth, probably, arose, due, to, their, being, confused, with, the, cellar, spider, as, they, are, also, informally, called, daddy, longlegs, and, although, the, arachnid, does, possess, venom, it, is, not, especially, potent, despite, widely, held, beliefs, that, adult, crane, flies, or, mosquito, hawks, prey, on, mosquito, populations, the, adult, crane, fly, is, anatomically, incapable, of, killing, or, consuming, other, insects, although, the, adults, of, some, species, may, feed, on, nectar, the, adults, of, many, species, have, such, short, lifespans, that, they, do, not, eat, at, all
