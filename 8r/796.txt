various, cervus, elaphus, subspecies, the, elk, pl, elk, or, elks, cervus, canadensis, or, wapiti, is, the, second, largest, species, within, the, deer, family, cervidae, and, one, of, the, largest, terrestrial, mammals, in, its, native, range, of, north, america, and, central, and, east, asia, the, word, elk, originally, referred, to, the, european, variety, of, the, moose, alces, alces, but, was, transferred, to, cervus, canadensis, by, north, american, colonists, the, name, wapiti, is, derived, from, a, shawnee, and, cree, word, meaning, white, rump, after, the, distinctive, light, fur, around, the, tail, region, which, the, animals, may, fluff, up, or, raise, to, signal, their, agitation, or, distress, to, one, another, when, fleeing, perceived, threats, or, among, males, courting, females, and, sparring, for, dominance, a, similar, trait, is, seen, in, other, artiodactyl, species, like, the, bighorn, sheep, pronghorn, and, the, white, tailed, deer, to, varying, degrees, elk, dwell, in, open, forest, and, forest, edge, habitats, grazing, on, grasses, and, sedges, and, browsing, higher, growing, plants, leaves, twigs, and, bark, male, elk, have, large, blood, and, nerve, filled, antlers, which, they, routinely, shed, each, year, as, weather, warms, up, males, also, engage, in, ritualized, mating, behaviors, during, the, mating, season, including, posturing, to, attract, females, antler, wrestling, sparring, and, bugling, a, loud, series, of, throaty, whistles, bellows, screams, and, other, vocalizations, that, establish, dominance, over, other, males, and, aim, to, attract, females, elk, were, long, believed, to, belong, to, a, subspecies, of, the, european, red, deer, cervus, elaphus, but, evidence, from, many, mitochondrial, dna, genetic, studies, beginning, in, 1998, shows, that, the, two, are, distinct, species, the, elk, s, wider, rump, patch, and, paler, hued, antlers, are, key, morphological, differences, that, distinguish, c, canadensis, from, c, elaphus, although, it, is, currently, only, native, to, north, america, and, central, and, east, asia, elk, once, had, a, much, wider, distribution, in, the, past, prehistoric, populations, were, present, across, eurasia, and, into, western, europe, during, the, late, pleistocene, surviving, into, the, early, holocene, in, southern, sweden, and, the, alps, the, now, extinct, north, american, merriam, s, elk, subspecies, cervus, canadensis, merriami, once, ranged, south, into, mexico, the, wapiti, has, also, successfully, adapted, to, countries, outside, of, its, natural, range, where, it, has, been, introduced, including, argentina, and, new, zealand, the, animal, s, adaptability, in, these, areas, may, in, fact, be, so, successful, as, to, threaten, the, sensitive, endemic, ecosystems, and, species, it, encounters, as, a, member, of, the, artiodactyla, order, and, distant, relative, of, the, bovidae, elk, are, susceptible, to, several, infectious, diseases, which, can, be, transmitted, to, and, or, from, domesticated, livestock, efforts, to, eliminate, infectious, diseases, from, elk, populations, primarily, by, vaccination, have, had, mixed, success, some, cultures, revere, the, elk, as, having, spiritual, significance, antlers, and, velvet, are, used, in, traditional, medicines, in, parts, of, asia, the, production, of, ground, antler, and, velvet, supplements, is, also, a, thriving, naturopathic, industry, in, several, countries, including, the, united, states, and, canada, the, elk, is, hunted, as, a, game, species, and, their, meat, is, leaner, and, higher, in, protein, than, beef, or, chicken, by, the, 17th, century, alces, alces, moose, called, elk, in, europe, had, long, been, extirpated, from, the, british, isles, and, the, meaning, of, the, word, elk, to, english, speakers, became, rather, vague, acquiring, a, meaning, similar, to, large, deer, the, name, wapiti, is, from, the, shawnee, and, cree, word, waapiti, in, cree, syllabics, or, meaning, white, rump, there, is, a, subspecies, of, wapiti, in, mongolia, called, the, altai, wapiti, cervus, canadensis, sibiricus, also, known, as, the, altai, maral, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, etymology, of, the, word, elk, is, of, obscure, history, in, classical, antiquity, the, european, alces, alces, was, known, as, ancient, greek, romanized, lk, and, latin, alces, words, probably, borrowed, from, a, germanic, language, or, another, language, of, northern, europe, by, the, 8th, century, during, the, early, middle, ages, the, moose, was, known, as, old, english, elch, elh, eolh, derived, from, the, proto, germanic, elho, elhon, and, possibly, connected, with, the, old, norse, elgr, later, the, species, became, known, in, middle, english, as, elk, elcke, or, elke, appearing, in, the, latinized, form, alke, with, the, spelling, alce, borrowed, directly, from, latin, alces, noting, that, elk, is, not, the, normal, phonetic, representative, of, the, old, english, elch, the, oxford, english, dictionary, derives, elk, from, middle, high, german, elch, itself, from, old, high, german, elaho, the, american, cervus, canadensis, was, recognized, as, a, relative, of, the, red, deer, cervus, elaphus, of, europe, and, so, cervus, canadensis, were, referred, to, as, red, deer, richard, hakluyt, refers, to, north, america, as, a, lande, full, of, many, beastes, as, redd, dere, in, his, 1584, discourse, concerning, western, planting, similarly, john, smith, s, 1616, a, description, of, new, england, referred, to, red, deer, sir, william, talbot, s, 1672, english, translation, of, john, lederer, s, latin, discoveries, likewise, called, the, species, red, deer, but, noted, in, parentheses, that, they, were, for, their, unusual, largeness, improperly, termed, elks, by, ignorant, people, both, thomas, jefferson, s, 1785, notes, on, the, state, of, virginia, and, david, bailie, warden, s, 1816, statistical, political, and, historical, account, of, the, united, states, used, red, deer, to, refer, to, cervus, canadensis, members, of, the, genus, cervus, and, hence, early, relatives, or, possible, ancestors, of, the, elk, first, appear, in, the, fossil, record, 25, million, years, ago, during, the, oligocene, in, eurasia, but, do, not, appear, in, the, north, american, fossil, record, until, the, early, miocene, the, extinct, irish, elk, megaloceros, was, not, a, member, of, the, genus, cervus, but, rather, the, largest, member, of, the, wider, deer, family, cervidae, known, from, the, fossil, record, until, recently, red, deer, and, elk, were, considered, to, be, one, species, cervus, elaphus, with, over, a, dozen, subspecies, but, mitochondrial, dna, studies, conducted, in, 2004, on, hundreds, of, samples, from, red, deer, and, elk, subspecies, and, other, species, of, the, cervus, deer, family, strongly, indicate, that, elk, or, wapiti, should, be, a, distinct, species, namely, cervus, canadensis, dna, evidence, validates, that, elk, are, more, closely, related, to, thorold, s, deer, and, even, sika, deer, than, they, are, to, the, red, deer, elk, and, red, deer, produce, fertile, offspring, in, captivity, and, the, two, species, have, freely, inter, bred, in, new, zealand, s, fiordland, national, park, the, cross, bred, animals, have, resulted, in, the, disappearance, of, virtually, all, pure, elk, blood, from, the, area, key, morphological, differences, that, distinguish, c, canadensis, from, c, elaphus, are, the, former, s, wider, rump, patch, and, paler, hued, antlers, there, are, numerous, subspecies, of, elk, described, with, six, from, north, america, and, four, from, asia, although, some, taxonomists, consider, them, different, ecotypes, or, races, of, the, same, species, adapted, to, local, environments, through, minor, changes, in, appearance, and, behavior, populations, vary, in, antler, shape, and, size, body, size, coloration, and, mating, behavior, dna, investigations, of, the, eurasian, subspecies, revealed, that, phenotypic, variation, in, antlers, mane, and, rump, patch, development, are, based, on, climatic, related, lifestyle, factors, of, the, six, subspecies, of, elk, known, to, have, inhabited, north, america, in, historical, times, four, remain, including, the, roosevelt, c, canadensis, roosevelti, tule, c, c, nannodes, manitoban, c, c, manitobensis, and, rocky, mountain, elk, c, c, nelsoni, the, eastern, elk, c, c, canadensis, and, merriam, s, elk, c, c, merriami, subspecies, have, been, extinct, for, at, least, a, century, four, subspecies, described, from, the, asian, continent, include, the, altai, wapiti, c, c, sibiricus, and, the, tianshan, wapiti, c, c, songaricus, two, distinct, subspecies, found, in, china, mongolia, the, korean, peninsula, and, siberia, are, the, manchurian, wapiti, c, c, xanthopygus, and, the, alashan, wapiti, c, c, alashanicus, the, manchurian, subspecies, is, darker, and, more, reddish, in, coloration, than, other, populations, the, alashan, wapiti, of, northern, central, china, is, the, smallest, of, all, the, subspecies, has, the, lightest, coloration, and, is, one, of, the, least, studied, recent, dna, analyses, suggest, that, there, are, no, more, than, three, or, four, total, subspecies, of, elk, all, american, forms, aside, from, possibly, the, tule, and, the, roosevelt, s, elk, seem, to, belong, to, one, subspecies, cervus, c, canadensis, even, the, siberian, elk, c, c, sibiricus, is, more, or, less, physically, identical, to, the, american, forms, and, thus, may, belong, to, this, subspecies, too, however, the, manchurian, wapiti, c, c, xanthopygus, is, clearly, distinct, from, the, siberian, forms, but, not, distinguishable, from, the, alashan, wapiti, still, due, to, the, insufficient, genetic, material, that, rejects, monophyly, of, c, canadensis, some, researchers, consider, it, premature, to, include, the, manchurian, wapiti, as, a, true, subspecies, of, wapiti, and, that, it, likely, needs, to, be, elevated, to, its, own, species, c, xanthopygus, the, chinese, forms, the, sichuan, deer, kansu, red, deer, and, tibetan, red, deer, also, belong, to, the, wapiti, and, were, not, distinguishable, from, each, other, by, mitochondrial, dna, studies, these, chinese, subspecies, are, sometimes, treated, as, a, distinct, species, namely, the, central, asian, red, deer, cervus, hanglu, which, also, includes, the, kashmir, stag, elk, have, thick, bodies, with, slender, legs, and, short, tails, they, have, a, shoulder, height, of, 0, 75, 1, 5, m, 2, ft, 6, in, 4, ft, 11, in, with, a, nose, to, tail, length, of, 1, 6, 2, 7, m, 5, ft, 3, in, 8, ft, 10, in, males, are, larger, and, weigh, 178, 497, kg, 392, 1, 096, lb, while, females, weigh, 171, 292, kg, 377, 644, lb, the, largest, of, the, subspecies, is, the, roosevelt, elk, c, c, roosevelti, found, west, of, the, cascade, range, in, the, u, s, states, of, california, oregon, and, washington, and, in, the, canadian, province, of, british, columbia, roosevelt, elk, have, been, introduced, into, alaska, where, the, largest, males, are, estimated, to, weigh, up, to, 600, kg, 1, 300, lb, more, typically, male, roosevelt, elk, weigh, around, 318, to, 499, kg, 701, to, 1, 100, lb, while, females, weigh, 261, to, 283, kg, 575, to, 624, lb, male, tule, elk, weigh, 204, 318, kg, 450, 701, lb, while, females, weigh, 170, 191, kg, 375, 421, lb, the, whole, weights, of, adult, male, manitoban, elk, range, from, 288, to, 478, kilograms, 635, to, 1, 054, lb, females, have, a, mean, weight, of, 275, kilograms, 606, lb, the, elk, is, the, second, largest, extant, species, of, deer, after, the, moose, antlers, are, made, of, bone, which, can, grow, at, a, rate, of, 2, 5, centimeters, 0, 98, in, per, day, while, actively, growing, a, soft, layer, of, highly, vascularized, skin, known, as, velvet, covers, and, protects, them, this, is, shed, in, the, summer, when, the, antlers, have, fully, developed, bull, elk, typically, have, around, six, tines, on, each, antler, the, siberian, and, north, american, elk, carry, the, largest, antlers, while, the, altai, wapiti, has, the, smallest, roosevelt, bull, antlers, can, weigh, 18, kg, 40, lb, the, formation, and, retention, of, antlers, are, testosterone, driven, in, late, winter, and, early, spring, the, testosterone, level, drops, which, causes, the, antlers, to, shed, during, the, fall, elk, grow, a, thicker, coat, of, hair, which, helps, to, insulate, them, during, the, winter, both, male, and, female, north, american, elk, grow, thin, neck, manes, females, of, other, subspecies, may, not, 37, by, early, summer, the, heavy, winter, coat, has, been, shed, elk, are, known, to, rub, against, trees, and, other, objects, to, help, remove, hair, from, their, bodies, all, elk, have, small, and, clearly, defined, rump, patches, with, short, tails, they, have, different, coloration, based, on, the, seasons, and, types, of, habitats, with, gray, or, lighter, coloration, prevalent, in, the, winter, and, a, more, reddish, darker, coat, in, the, summer, subspecies, living, in, arid, climates, tend, to, have, lighter, colored, coats, than, do, those, living, in, forests, most, have, lighter, yellow, brown, to, orange, brown, coats, in, contrast, to, dark, brown, hair, on, the, head, neck, and, legs, during, the, summer, forest, adapted, manchurian, and, alashan, wapitis, have, red, or, reddish, brown, coats, with, less, contrast, between, the, body, coat, and, the, rest, of, the, body, during, the, summer, months, calves, are, born, spotted, as, is, common, with, many, deer, species, and, lose, them, by, the, end, of, summer, adult, manchurian, wapiti, may, retain, a, few, orange, spots, on, the, back, of, their, summer, coats, until, they, are, older, this, characteristic, has, also, been, observed, in, the, forest, adapted, european, red, deer, elk, are, among, the, most, gregarious, deer, species, 52, during, the, summer, group, size, can, reach, 400, individuals, for, most, of, the, year, adult, males, and, females, are, segregated, into, different, herds, female, herds, are, larger, while, bulls, form, small, groups, and, may, even, travel, alone, young, bulls, may, associate, with, older, bulls, or, female, groups, male, and, female, herds, come, together, during, the, mating, season, which, may, begin, in, late, august, 75, 82, males, try, to, intimidate, rivals, by, vocalizing, and, displaying, with, their, antlers, 109, if, neither, bull, backs, down, they, engage, in, antler, wrestling, sometimes, sustaining, serious, injuries, bulls, have, a, loud, high, pitched, whistle, like, vocalization, known, as, bugling, which, advertise, the, male, s, fitness, over, great, distances, unusual, for, a, vocalization, produced, by, a, large, animal, buglings, can, reach, a, frequency, of, 4000, hz, this, is, achieved, by, blowing, air, from, the, glottis, through, the, nasal, cavities, elk, can, produce, deeper, pitched, 150, hz, sounds, using, the, larynx, cows, produce, an, alarm, bark, to, alert, other, members, of, the, herd, to, danger, while, calves, will, produce, a, high, pitched, scream, when, attacked, female, elk, have, a, short, estrus, cycle, of, only, a, day, or, two, and, matings, usually, involve, a, dozen, or, more, attempts, by, the, autumn, of, their, second, year, females, can, produce, one, and, very, rarely, two, offspring, reproduction, is, most, common, when, cows, weigh, at, least, 200, kilograms, 440, lb, dominant, bulls, follow, groups, of, cows, during, the, rut, from, august, into, early, winter, a, bull, will, defend, his, harem, of, 20, cows, or, more, from, competing, bulls, and, predators, 92, bulls, also, dig, holes, in, the, ground, called, wallows, in, which, they, urinate, and, roll, their, bodies, a, male, elk, s, urethra, points, upward, so, that, urine, is, sprayed, almost, at, a, right, angle, to, the, penis, the, urine, soaks, into, their, hair, and, gives, them, a, distinct, smell, which, attracts, cows, a, bull, interacts, with, cows, in, his, harem, in, two, ways, herding, and, courtship, when, a, female, wanders, too, far, away, from, the, harem, s, range, the, male, will, rush, ahead, of, her, block, her, path, and, aggressively, rush, her, back, to, the, harem, herding, behavior, is, accompanied, by, a, stretched, out, and, lowered, neck, and, the, antlers, laid, back, a, bull, may, get, violent, and, hit, the, cow, with, his, antlers, during, courtship, the, bull, is, more, peaceful, and, approaches, her, with, his, head, and, antlers, raised, the, male, signals, his, intention, to, test, the, female, for, sexual, receptivity, by, flicking, his, tongue, if, not, ready, a, cow, will, lower, her, head, and, weave, from, side, to, side, while, opening, and, closing, her, mouth, the, bull, will, stop, in, response, in, order, not, to, scare, her, 100, 101, otherwise, the, bull, will, copiously, lick, the, female, and, then, mount, her, 115, younger, less, dominant, bulls, known, as, spike, bulls, because, their, antlers, have, not, yet, forked, will, harass, unguarded, cows, these, bulls, are, impatient, and, will, not, perform, any, courtship, rituals, and, will, continue, to, pursue, a, female, even, when, she, signals, him, to, stop, as, such, they, are, less, reproductively, successful, and, a, cow, may, stay, close, to, the, big, bull, to, avoid, harassment, dominant, bulls, are, intolerant, of, spike, bulls, and, will, chase, them, away, from, their, harems, 100, 105, the, gestation, period, is, eight, to, nine, months, and, the, offspring, weigh, around, 16, kilograms, 35, lb, when, the, females, are, near, to, giving, birth, they, tend, to, isolate, themselves, from, the, main, herd, and, will, remain, isolated, until, the, calf, is, large, enough, to, escape, predators, calves, are, born, spotted, as, is, common, with, many, deer, species, and, they, lose, their, spots, by, the, end, of, summer, after, two, weeks, calves, are, able, to, join, the, herd, and, are, fully, weaned, at, two, months, of, age, elk, calves, are, as, large, as, an, adult, white, tailed, deer, by, the, time, they, are, six, months, old, elk, will, leave, their, natal, birth, ranges, before, they, are, three, years, old, males, disperse, more, often, than, females, as, adult, cows, are, more, tolerant, of, female, offspring, from, previous, years, elk, live, 20, years, or, more, in, captivity, but, average, 10, to, 13, years, in, the, wild, in, some, subspecies, that, suffer, less, predation, they, may, live, an, average, of, 15, years, in, the, wild, as, is, true, for, many, species, of, deer, especially, those, in, mountainous, regions, elk, migrate, into, areas, of, higher, altitude, in, the, spring, following, the, retreating, snows, and, the, opposite, direction, in, the, fall, hunting, pressure, impacts, migration, and, movement, during, the, winter, they, favor, wooded, areas, for, the, greater, availability, of, food, to, eat, elk, do, not, appear, to, benefit, from, thermal, cover, the, greater, yellowstone, ecosystem, elk, herds, comprise, as, many, as, 40, 000, individuals, during, the, spring, and, fall, they, take, part, in, the, longest, elk, migration, in, the, continental, u, s, traveling, as, much, as, 168, mi, 270, km, between, summer, and, winter, ranges, the, teton, herd, consists, of, between, 9, 000, and, 13, 000, elk, and, they, spend, winters, on, the, national, elk, refuge, having, migrated, south, from, the, southern, portions, of, yellowstone, national, park, and, west, from, the, shoshone, and, bridger, teton, national, forests, elk, are, ruminants, and, therefore, have, four, chambered, stomachs, unlike, white, tailed, deer, and, moose, which, are, chiefly, browsers, elk, are, similar, to, cattle, in, that, they, are, primarily, grazers, but, like, other, deer, they, also, browse, elk, have, a, tendency, to, do, most, of, their, feeding, in, the, mornings, and, evenings, seeking, sheltered, areas, in, between, feedings, to, digest, their, diets, vary, somewhat, depending, on, the, season, with, native, grasses, being, a, year, round, supplement, tree, bark, being, consumed, in, winter, and, forbs, and, tree, sprouts, during, the, summer, elk, consume, an, average, of, 9, 1, kilograms, 20, lb, of, vegetation, daily, particularly, fond, of, aspen, sprouts, which, rise, in, the, spring, elk, have, had, some, impact, on, aspen, groves, which, have, been, declining, in, some, regions, where, elk, exist, range, and, wildlife, managers, conduct, surveys, of, elk, pellet, groups, to, monitor, populations, and, resource, use, research, in, the, greater, yellowstone, ecosystem, has, found, that, supplemental, feeding, of, concentrated, alfalfa, pellets, leads, to, significant, alterations, in, the, elks, microbiome, the, elk, gut, microbiome, is, typically, characterized, by, a, diverse, community, of, bacteria, specialized, in, breaking, down, complex, plant, fibers, and, cellulose, whereas, the, supplementally, fed, gut, microbiome, may, have, less, fiber, digesting, bacteria, therefore, transitioning, from, natural, foraging, to, concentrated, alfalfa, pellets, can, cause, changes, in, the, gut, microbiome, that, might, affect, the, elk, s, ability, to, efficiently, digest, their, natural, diet, or, could, potentially, lead, to, imbalances, that, affect, overall, health, predators, of, elk, include, wolves, coyotes, brown, and, black, bears, cougars, and, siberian, tigers, coyote, packs, mostly, prey, on, elk, calves, though, they, can, sometimes, take, a, winter, or, disease, weakened, adult, in, the, greater, yellowstone, ecosystem, which, includes, yellowstone, national, park, bears, are, the, most, significant, predators, of, calves, while, healthy, bulls, have, never, been, recorded, to, be, killed, by, bears, and, such, encounters, can, be, fatal, for, bears, the, killing, of, cows, in, their, prime, is, more, likely, to, affect, population, growth, than, the, killing, of, bulls, or, calves, elk, may, avoid, predation, by, switching, from, grazing, to, browsing, grazing, puts, an, elk, in, the, compromising, situation, of, being, in, an, open, area, with, its, head, down, leaving, it, unable, to, see, what, is, going, on, in, the, surrounding, area, living, in, groups, also, lessens, the, risk, of, an, individual, falling, to, predation, large, bull, elk, are, less, vulnerable, and, can, afford, to, wander, alone, while, cows, stay, in, larger, groups, for, protection, for, their, calves, 75, bulls, are, more, vulnerable, to, predation, by, wolves, in, late, winter, after, they, have, been, weakened, by, months, of, chasing, females, and, fighting, males, that, have, recently, lost, their, antlers, are, more, likely, to, be, preyed, upon, at, least, 53, species, of, protist, and, animal, parasites, have, been, identified, in, elk, most, of, these, parasites, seldom, lead, to, significant, mortality, among, wild, or, captive, elk, parelaphostrongylus, tenuis, brainworm, or, meningeal, worm, is, a, parasitic, nematode, known, to, affect, the, spinal, cord, and, brain, tissue, of, elk, and, other, species, leading, to, death, the, definitive, host, is, the, white, tailed, deer, in, which, it, normally, has, no, ill, effects, snails, and, slugs, the, intermediate, hosts, can, be, inadvertently, consumed, by, elk, during, grazing, the, liver, fluke, fascioloides, magna, and, the, nematode, dictyocaulus, viviparus, are, also, commonly, found, parasites, that, can, be, fatal, to, elk, chronic, wasting, disease, transmitted, by, a, misfolded, protein, known, as, a, prion, affects, the, brain, tissue, in, elk, and, has, been, detected, throughout, their, range, in, north, america, first, documented, in, the, late, 1960s, in, mule, deer, the, disease, has, affected, elk, on, game, farms, and, in, the, wild, in, a, number, of, regions, elk, that, have, contracted, the, disease, begin, to, show, weight, loss, changes, in, behavior, increased, watering, needs, excessive, salivation, and, urinating, and, difficulty, swallowing, and, at, an, advanced, stage, the, disease, leads, to, death, no, risks, to, humans, have, been, documented, nor, has, the, disease, been, demonstrated, to, pose, a, threat, to, domesticated, cattle, in, 2002, south, korea, banned, the, importation, of, elk, antler, velvet, due, to, concerns, about, chronic, wasting, disease, the, gram, negative, bacterial, disease, brucellosis, occasionally, affects, elk, in, the, greater, yellowstone, ecosystem, the, only, place, in, the, u, s, where, the, disease, is, still, known, to, exist, though, this, can, extend, out, to, the, bighorn, mountains, in, domesticated, cattle, brucellosis, causes, infertility, abortions, and, reduced, milk, production, it, is, transmitted, to, humans, as, undulant, fever, producing, influenza, like, symptoms, that, may, last, for, years, though, bison, are, more, likely, to, transmit, the, disease, to, other, animals, elk, inadvertently, transmitted, brucellosis, to, horses, in, wyoming, and, cattle, in, idaho, researchers, are, attempting, to, eradicate, the, disease, through, vaccinations, and, herd, management, measures, which, are, expected, to, be, successful, nevertheless, research, has, been, ongoing, since, 2002, and, a, successful, vaccine, has, yet, to, be, developed, as, of, 2016, a, recent, necropsy, study, of, captive, elk, in, pennsylvania, attributed, the, cause, of, death, in, 33, of, 65, cases, to, either, gastrointestinal, parasites, 21, cases, primarily, eimeria, sp, and, ostertagia, sp, or, bacterial, infections, 12, cases, mostly, pneumonia, elk, hoof, disease, was, first, noticed, in, the, state, of, washington, in, the, late, 1990s, in, the, cowlitz, river, basin, with, sporadic, reports, of, deformed, hooves, since, then, the, disease, has, spread, rapidly, with, increased, sightings, throughout, southwest, washington, and, into, oregon, the, disease, is, characterised, by, deformed, broken, or, missing, hooves, and, leads, to, severe, lameness, in, elk, the, primary, cause, is, not, known, but, it, is, associated, with, treponeme, bacteria, which, are, known, to, cause, digital, dermatitis, in, commercial, livestock, the, mode, of, transmission, is, also, not, known, but, it, appears, to, be, highly, contagious, among, elk, studies, are, being, undertaken, by, government, departments, to, determine, how, to, halt, or, eliminate, the, disease, the, elk, ranges, from, central, asia, through, to, siberia, and, east, asia, and, in, north, america, they, can, be, found, in, open, deciduous, woodlands, boreal, forests, upland, moors, mountainous, areas, and, grasslands, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, and, natural, resources, iucn, list, the, species, as, least, concern, species, the, habitat, of, siberian, elk, in, asia, is, similar, to, that, of, the, rocky, mountain, subspecies, in, north, america, during, the, late, pleistocene, their, range, was, much, more, extensive, being, distributed, across, eurasia, with, remains, being, found, as, far, west, as, france, these, populations, are, most, closely, related, to, modern, asian, populations, of, the, elk, their, range, collapsed, at, the, start, of, the, holocene, possibly, because, they, were, specialized, to, cold, periglacial, tundra, steppe, habitat, when, this, environment, was, replaced, largely, by, closed, forest, the, red, deer, might, have, outcompeted, the, elk, relictual, populations, survived, into, the, early, holocene, until, around, 3000, years, ago, in, southern, sweden, and, the, alps, where, the, environment, remained, favorable, as, of, 2014, population, figures, for, all, north, american, elk, subspecies, were, around, one, million, prior, to, the, european, colonization, of, north, america, there, were, an, estimated, 10, million, on, the, continent, there, are, many, past, and, ongoing, examples, of, reintroduction, into, areas, of, the, us, elk, were, reintroduced, in, michigan, in, 1918, after, going, extinct, there, in, 1875, the, rocky, mountain, elk, subspecies, was, reintroduced, by, hunter, conservation, organizations, into, the, appalachian, region, of, the, u, s, where, the, now, extinct, eastern, elk, once, lived, they, were, reintroduced, to, pennsylvania, beginning, in, 1913, and, throughout, the, mid, 20th, century, and, now, remain, at, a, stable, population, of, approximately, 1, 400, individuals, since, the, late, 1990s, they, were, reintroduced, and, recolonized, in, the, states, of, wisconsin, kentucky, north, carolina, tennessee, georgia, virginia, and, west, virginia, in, the, state, of, kentucky, the, elk, population, in, 2022, had, increased, to, over, 15, 000, animals, in, 2016, a, male, elk, likely, from, the, smoky, mountains, population, was, sighted, in, south, carolina, for, the, first, time, in, nearly, 300, years, once, locally, extinct, dispersing, elk, are, now, regularly, spotted, in, iowa, although, a, wild, population, has, not, yet, established, since, 2015, elk, have, also, been, reintroduced, in, a, number, of, other, states, including, missouri, and, introduced, to, the, islands, of, etolin, and, afognak, in, alaska, reintroduction, of, the, elk, into, ontario, began, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, is, ongoing, with, limited, success, elk, and, red, deer, were, introduced, to, argentina, in, the, early, 20th, century, there, they, are, now, considered, an, invasive, species, encroaching, on, argentinian, ecosystems, where, they, compete, for, food, with, the, indigenous, chilean, huemul, and, other, herbivores, this, negative, impact, on, native, animal, species, has, led, the, iucn, to, identify, the, elk, as, one, of, the, world, s, 100, worst, invaders, the, introduction, of, deer, to, new, zealand, began, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, and, current, populations, are, primarily, european, red, deer, with, only, 15, percent, being, elk, in, 1905, 18, american, wapiti, were, released, in, george, sound, in, the, fiordland, national, park, in, 1949, the, new, zealand, american, fiordland, expedition, was, undertaken, to, study, the, descendants, of, this, release, there, is, significant, hybridization, of, elk, with, red, deer, these, deer, have, had, an, adverse, impact, on, forest, regeneration, of, some, plant, species, as, they, consume, more, palatable, species, which, are, replaced, with, those, that, are, less, favored, by, the, elk, the, long, term, impact, will, be, an, alteration, of, the, types, of, plants, and, trees, found, and, in, other, animal, and, plant, species, dependent, upon, them, as, in, chile, and, argentina, the, iucn, has, declared, that, red, deer, and, elk, populations, in, new, zealand, are, an, invasive, species, elk, have, played, an, important, role, in, the, cultural, history, of, a, number, of, peoples, neolithic, petroglyphs, from, asia, depict, antler, less, female, elk, which, have, been, interpreted, as, symbolizing, life, and, sustenance, they, were, also, frequently, overlaid, with, boats, and, associated, with, rivers, suggesting, they, also, represented, paths, to, the, underworld, petroglyphs, of, elk, were, carved, into, cliffs, by, the, ancestral, puebloans, of, the, southwestern, u, s, hundreds, of, years, ago, the, elk, was, of, particular, importance, to, the, lakota, and, played, a, spiritual, role, in, their, society, the, male, elk, was, admired, for, its, ability, to, attract, mates, and, lakota, men, will, play, a, courting, flute, imitating, a, bugling, elk, to, attract, women, men, used, elks, antlers, as, love, charms, and, wore, clothes, decorated, with, elk, images, the, rocky, mountain, elk, is, the, official, state, animal, for, utah, an, image, of, an, elk, and, a, moose, appear, on, the, state, seal, and, flag, of, michigan, the, benevolent, and, protective, order, of, elks, b, p, o, e, chose, the, elk, as, its, namesake, because, a, number, of, its, attributes, seemed, appropriate, for, cultivation, by, members, of, the, fraternity, jewel, encrusted, gold, mounted, elk, teeth, are, prized, possessions, of, many, members, of, the, b, p, o, e, although, breakdown, figures, for, each, game, species, are, not, available, in, the, 2006, national, survey, from, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, hunting, of, wild, elk, is, most, likely, the, primary, economic, impact, while, elk, are, not, generally, harvested, for, meat, production, on, a, large, scale, some, restaurants, offer, the, meat, as, a, specialty, item, and, it, is, also, available, in, some, grocery, stores, the, meat, has, a, taste, somewhere, between, beef, and, venison, and, is, higher, in, protein, and, lower, in, fat, and, cholesterol, than, beef, pork, and, chicken, elk, meat, is, a, good, source, of, iron, phosphorus, and, zinc, a, male, elk, can, produce, 10, to, 11, kilograms, 22, to, 24, lb, of, antler, velvet, annually, and, on, ranches, in, the, united, states, canada, and, new, zealand, it, is, collected, and, sold, to, markets, in, east, asia, where, it, is, used, in, medicine, some, cultures, consider, antler, velvet, to, be, an, aphrodisiac, however, consuming, velvet, from, elk, in, north, america, may, be, risky, since, velvet, from, animals, infected, with, chronic, wasting, disease, may, contain, prions, that, could, result, in, a, human, getting, variant, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, antlers, are, also, used, in, artwork, furniture, and, other, novelty, items, all, asian, subspecies, along, with, other, deer, have, been, raised, for, their, antlers, in, central, and, eastern, asia, by, han, chinese, turkic, peoples, tungusic, peoples, mongolians, and, koreans, elk, farms, are, relatively, common, in, north, america, and, new, zealand, native, americans, have, used, elk, hides, for, tepee, covering, clothing, and, footwear, since, 1967, the, boy, scouts, of, america, have, assisted, employees, at, the, national, elk, refuge, in, wyoming, by, collecting, the, antlers, which, are, shed, each, winter, they, are, then, auctioned, with, 80, of, the, proceeds, returned, to, the, refuge, in, 2010, 2, 520, kilograms, 5, 560, lb, of, antlers, were, auctioned, which, brought, in, over, 46, 000
