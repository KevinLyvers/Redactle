a, psychiatric, hospital, also, known, as, a, mental, health, hospital, or, a, behavioral, health, hospital, is, a, specialized, medical, facility, that, focuses, on, the, treatment, of, severe, mental, disorders, these, institutions, cater, to, patients, with, conditions, such, as, schizophrenia, bipolar, disorder, major, depressive, disorder, and, eating, disorders, among, others, psychiatric, hospitals, vary, considerably, in, size, and, classification, some, specialize, in, short, term, or, outpatient, therapy, for, low, risk, patients, while, others, provide, long, term, care, for, individuals, requiring, routine, assistance, or, a, controlled, environment, due, to, their, psychiatric, condition, patients, may, choose, voluntary, commitment, but, those, deemed, to, pose, a, significant, danger, to, themselves, or, others, may, be, subject, to, involuntary, commitment, and, treatment, in, general, hospitals, psychiatric, wards, or, units, serve, a, similar, purpose, modern, psychiatric, hospitals, have, evolved, from, the, older, concept, of, lunatic, asylums, shifting, focus, from, mere, containment, and, restraint, to, evidence, based, treatments, that, aim, to, help, patients, function, in, society, with, successive, waves, of, reform, and, the, introduction, of, effective, evidence, based, treatments, most, modern, psychiatric, hospitals, emphasize, treatment, usually, including, a, combination, of, psychiatric, medications, and, psychotherapy, that, assist, patients, in, functioning, in, the, outside, world, many, countries, have, prohibited, the, use, of, physical, restraints, on, patients, which, includes, tying, psychiatric, patients, to, their, beds, for, days, or, even, months, at, a, time, though, this, practice, still, is, periodically, employed, in, the, united, states, india, japan, and, other, countries, modern, psychiatric, hospitals, evolved, from, and, eventually, replaced, the, older, lunatic, asylum, their, development, also, entails, the, rise, of, organized, institutional, psychiatry, hospitals, known, as, bimaristans, were, built, in, the, middle, east, in, the, early, ninth, century, the, first, was, built, in, baghdad, under, the, leadership, of, harun, al, rashid, while, not, devoted, solely, to, patients, with, psychiatric, disorders, early, psychiatric, hospitals, often, contained, wards, for, patients, exhibiting, mania, or, other, psychological, distress, because, of, cultural, taboos, against, refusing, to, care, for, one, s, family, members, mentally, ill, patients, would, be, surrendered, to, a, bimaristan, only, if, the, patient, demonstrated, violence, incurable, chronic, illness, or, some, other, extremely, debilitating, ailment, psychological, wards, were, typically, enclosed, by, iron, bars, owing, to, the, aggression, of, some, of, the, patients, in, western, europe, the, first, idea, and, set, up, for, a, proper, mental, hospital, entered, through, spain, a, member, of, the, mercedarian, order, named, juan, gilaberto, jofr, traveled, frequently, to, islamic, countries, and, observed, several, institutions, that, confined, the, insane, he, proposed, the, founding, of, an, institution, exclusive, for, sick, people, who, had, to, be, treated, by, doctors, something, very, modern, for, the, time, the, foundation, was, carried, out, in, 1409, thanks, to, several, wealthy, men, from, valencia, who, contributed, funds, for, its, completion, it, was, considered, the, first, institution, in, the, world, at, that, time, specialized, in, the, treatment, of, mental, illnesses, later, on, physicians, including, philippe, pinel, at, bic, tre, hospital, in, france, and, william, tuke, at, york, retreat, in, england, began, to, advocate, for, the, viewing, of, mental, illness, as, a, disorder, that, required, compassionate, treatment, that, would, aid, in, the, rehabilitation, of, the, victim, in, the, western, world, the, arrival, of, institutionalisation, as, a, solution, to, the, problem, of, madness, was, very, much, an, advent, of, the, nineteenth, century, the, first, public, mental, asylums, were, established, in, britain, the, passing, of, the, county, asylums, act, 1808, empowered, magistrates, to, build, rate, supported, asylums, in, every, county, to, house, the, many, pauper, lunatics, nine, counties, first, applied, the, first, public, asylum, opening, in, 1812, in, nottinghamshire, in, 1828, the, newly, appointed, commissioners, in, lunacy, were, empowered, to, license, and, supervise, private, asylums, the, lunacy, act, 1845, made, the, construction, of, asylums, in, every, county, compulsory, with, regular, inspections, on, behalf, of, the, home, secretary, and, required, asylums, to, have, written, regulations, and, a, resident, physician, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, there, were, a, few, thousand, people, housed, in, a, variety, of, disparate, institutions, throughout, england, but, by, 1900, that, figure, had, grown, to, about, 100, 000, this, growth, coincided, with, the, growth, of, alienism, later, known, as, psychiatry, as, a, medical, specialism, the, treatment, of, inmates, in, early, lunatic, asylums, was, sometimes, very, brutal, and, focused, on, containment, and, restraint, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, psychiatric, institutions, ceased, using, terms, such, as, madness, lunacy, or, insanity, which, assumed, a, unitary, psychosis, and, began, instead, splitting, into, numerous, mental, diseases, including, catatonia, melancholia, and, dementia, praecox, which, is, now, known, as, schizophrenia, in, 1961, sociologist, erving, goffman, described, a, theory, of, the, total, institution, and, the, process, by, which, it, takes, efforts, to, maintain, predictable, and, regular, behavior, on, the, part, of, both, guard, and, captor, suggesting, that, many, of, the, features, of, such, institutions, serve, the, ritual, function, of, ensuring, that, both, classes, of, people, know, their, function, and, social, role, in, other, words, of, institutionalizing, them, asylums, as, a, key, text, in, the, development, of, deinstitutionalization, with, successive, waves, of, reform, and, the, introduction, of, effective, evidence, based, treatments, modern, psychiatric, hospitals, provide, a, primary, emphasis, on, treatment, and, further, they, attempt, where, possible, to, help, patients, control, their, own, lives, in, the, outside, world, with, the, use, of, a, combination, of, psychiatric, drugs, and, psychotherapy, these, treatments, can, be, involuntary, involuntary, treatments, are, among, the, many, psychiatric, practices, which, are, questioned, by, the, mental, patient, liberation, movement, there, are, several, different, types, of, modern, psychiatric, hospitals, but, all, of, them, house, people, with, mental, illnesses, of, varying, severity, in, the, united, kingdom, both, crisis, admissions, and, medium, term, care, are, usually, provided, on, acute, admissions, wards, juvenile, or, youth, wards, in, psychiatric, hospitals, or, psychiatric, wards, are, set, aside, for, children, or, youth, with, mental, illness, long, term, care, facilities, have, the, goal, of, treatment, and, rehabilitation, within, a, short, time, frame, two, or, three, years, another, institution, for, the, mentally, ill, is, a, community, based, halfway, house, crisis, stabilization, units, csu, are, small, facilities, with, minimal, beds, used, for, people, in, crisis, whose, needs, cannot, be, met, safely, in, residential, service, settings, open, psychiatric, units, are, not, as, secure, as, crisis, stabilization, units, they, are, not, used, for, acutely, suicidal, people, instead, the, focus, in, these, units, is, to, make, life, as, normal, as, possible, for, patients, while, continuing, treatment, to, the, point, where, they, can, be, discharged, however, patients, are, usually, still, not, allowed, to, hold, their, own, medications, in, their, rooms, because, of, the, risk, of, an, impulsive, overdose, while, some, open, units, are, physically, unlocked, other, open, units, still, use, locked, entrances, and, exits, depending, on, the, type, of, patients, admitted, another, type, of, psychiatric, hospital, is, medium, term, which, provides, care, lasting, several, weeks, most, drugs, used, for, psychiatric, purposes, take, several, weeks, to, take, effect, and, the, main, purpose, of, these, hospitals, is, to, monitor, the, patient, for, the, first, few, weeks, of, therapy, to, ensure, the, treatment, is, effective, juvenile, wards, are, sections, of, psychiatric, hospitals, or, psychiatric, wards, set, aside, for, children, with, mental, illness, however, there, are, a, number, of, institutions, specializing, only, in, the, treatment, of, juveniles, particularly, when, dealing, with, drug, abuse, self, harm, eating, disorders, anxiety, depression, or, other, mental, illnesses, in, the, united, kingdom, long, term, care, facilities, are, now, being, replaced, with, smaller, secure, units, some, within, hospitals, modern, buildings, modern, security, and, being, locally, situated, to, help, with, reintegration, into, society, once, medication, has, stabilized, the, condition, are, often, features, of, such, units, examples, of, this, include, the, three, bridges, unit, at, st, bernard, s, hospital, in, west, london, and, the, john, munroe, hospital, in, staffordshire, these, units, have, the, goal, of, treatment, and, rehabilitation, to, allow, for, transition, back, into, society, within, a, short, time, frame, usually, lasting, two, or, three, years, not, all, patients, treatment, meets, this, criterion, however, leading, larger, hospitals, to, retain, this, role, these, hospitals, provide, stabilization, and, rehabilitation, for, those, who, are, actively, experiencing, uncontrolled, symptoms, of, mental, disorders, such, as, depression, bipolar, disorders, eating, disorders, and, so, on, one, type, of, institution, for, the, mentally, ill, is, a, community, based, halfway, house, these, facilities, provide, assisted, living, for, an, extended, period, of, time, for, patients, with, mental, illnesses, and, they, often, aid, in, the, transition, to, self, sufficiency, these, institutions, are, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, parts, of, a, mental, health, system, by, many, psychiatrists, although, some, localities, lack, sufficient, funding, in, some, countries, the, mental, institution, may, be, used, for, the, incarceration, of, political, prisoners, as, a, form, of, punishment, one, notable, historical, example, was, the, use, of, punitive, psychiatry, in, the, soviet, union, and, china, like, the, former, soviet, union, and, china, belarus, also, has, used, punitive, psychiatry, toward, political, opponents, and, critics, of, current, government, in, modern, times, in, the, united, kingdom, criminal, courts, or, the, home, secretary, can, under, various, sections, of, the, mental, health, act, order, the, detention, of, offenders, in, a, psychiatric, hospital, but, the, term, criminally, insane, is, no, longer, legally, or, medically, recognized, secure, psychiatric, units, exist, in, all, regions, of, the, uk, for, this, purpose, in, addition, there, are, a, few, specialist, hospitals, which, offer, treatment, with, high, levels, of, security, these, facilities, are, divided, into, three, main, categories, high, medium, and, low, secure, although, the, phrase, maximum, secure, is, often, used, in, the, media, there, is, no, such, classification, local, secure, is, a, common, misnomer, for, low, secure, units, as, patients, are, often, detained, there, by, local, criminal, courts, for, psychiatric, assessment, before, sentencing, run, by, the, national, health, service, these, facilities, which, provide, psychiatric, assessments, can, also, provide, treatment, and, accommodation, in, a, safe, hospital, environment, which, prevents, absconding, thus, there, is, far, less, risk, of, patients, harming, themselves, or, others, in, dublin, the, central, mental, hospital, performs, a, similar, function, community, hospitals, across, the, united, states, regularly, discharge, mental, health, patients, who, are, then, typically, referred, to, out, patient, treatment, and, therapy, a, study, of, community, hospital, discharge, data, from, 2003, to, 2011, however, found, that, mental, health, hospitalizations, had, increased, for, both, children, and, adults, compared, to, other, hospital, utilization, mental, health, discharges, for, children, were, the, lowest, while, the, most, rapidly, increasing, hospitalizations, were, for, adults, under, 64, some, units, have, been, opened, to, provide, therapeutically, enhanced, treatment, a, subcategory, to, the, three, main, hospital, unit, types, in, the, uk, high, secure, hospitals, exist, including, ashworth, hospital, in, merseyside, broadmoor, hospital, in, crowthorne, rampton, secure, hospital, in, retford, and, the, state, hospital, in, carstairs, scotland, in, northern, ireland, the, isle, of, man, and, the, channel, islands, medium, and, low, secure, units, exist, but, high, secure, units, on, the, uk, mainland, are, used, for, patients, who, qualify, for, the, treatment, under, the, out, of, area, off, island, placements, referrals, provision, of, the, mental, health, act, 1983, among, the, three, unit, types, medium, secure, facilities, are, the, most, prevalent, in, the, uk, as, of, 2009, there, were, 27, women, only, units, in, england, irish, units, include, those, at, prisons, in, portlaise, castelrea, and, cork, psychiatrist, thomas, szasz, in, hungary, has, argued, that, psychiatric, hospitals, are, like, prisons, unlike, other, kinds, of, hospitals, and, that, psychiatrists, who, coerce, people, into, treatment, or, involuntary, commitment, function, as, judges, and, jailers, not, physicians, historian, michel, foucault, is, widely, known, for, his, comprehensive, critique, of, the, use, and, abuse, of, the, mental, hospital, system, in, madness, and, civilization, he, argued, that, tuke, and, pinel, s, asylum, was, a, symbolic, recreation, of, the, condition, of, a, child, under, a, bourgeois, family, it, was, a, microcosm, symbolizing, the, massive, structures, of, bourgeois, society, and, its, values, relations, of, family, children, paternal, authority, fault, punishment, immediate, justice, madness, disorder, social, and, moral, order, erving, goffman, coined, the, term, total, institution, for, mental, hospitals, and, similar, places, which, took, over, and, confined, a, person, s, whole, life, 150, 9, goffman, placed, psychiatric, hospitals, in, the, same, category, as, concentration, camps, prisons, military, organizations, orphanages, and, monasteries, in, his, book, asylums, goffman, describes, how, the, institutionalisation, process, socialises, people, into, the, role, of, a, good, patient, someone, dull, harmless, and, inconspicuous, in, turn, it, reinforces, notions, of, chronicity, in, severe, mental, illness, the, rosenhan, experiment, of, 1973, demonstrated, the, difficulty, of, distinguishing, sane, patients, from, insane, patients, franco, basaglia, a, leading, psychiatrist, who, inspired, and, planned, the, psychiatric, reform, in, italy, also, defined, the, mental, hospital, as, an, oppressive, locked, and, total, institution, in, which, prison, like, punitive, rules, are, applied, in, order, to, gradually, eliminate, its, own, contents, patients, doctors, and, nurses, are, all, subjected, at, different, levels, to, the, same, process, of, institutionalism, american, psychiatrist, loren, mosher, noticed, that, the, psychiatric, institution, itself, gave, him, master, classes, in, the, art, of, the, total, institution, labeling, unnecessary, dependency, the, induction, and, perpetuation, of, powerlessness, the, degradation, ceremony, authoritarianism, and, the, primacy, of, institutional, needs, over, the, patients, whom, it, was, ostensibly, there, to, serve, the, anti, psychiatry, movement, coming, to, the, fore, in, the, 1960s, has, opposed, many, of, the, practices, conditions, or, existence, of, mental, hospitals, due, to, the, extreme, conditions, in, them, the, psychiatric, consumer, survivor, movement, has, often, objected, to, or, campaigned, against, conditions, in, mental, hospitals, or, their, use, voluntarily, or, involuntarily, the, mental, patient, liberation, movement, emphatically, opposes, involuntary, treatment, but, it, generally, does, not, object, to, any, psychiatric, treatments, that, are, consensual, provided, that, both, parties, can, withdraw, consent, at, any, time, alongside, the, 1973, academic, investigation, by, rosenhan, and, other, similar, experiments, several, journalists, have, been, willingly, admitted, to, hospitals, in, order, to, conduct, undercover, journalism, these, include
