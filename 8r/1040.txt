have, slender, stems, that, are, not, thickly, woody, and, have, small, evergreen, leaves, the, flowers, are, dark, pink, the, fruit, is, a, berry, that, is, larger, than, the, leaves, of, the, plant, it, is, initially, light, green, turning, red, when, ripe, it, is, edible, but, has, an, acidic, taste, in, britain, cranberry, may, refer, to, the, native, species, vaccinium, oxycoccos, while, in, north, america, cranberry, may, refer, to, v, macrocarpon, vaccinium, oxycoccos, is, cultivated, in, central, and, northern, europe, while, v, macrocarpon, is, cultivated, throughout, the, northern, united, states, canada, and, chile, in, some, methods, of, classification, oxycoccus, is, regarded, as, a, genus, in, its, own, right, cranberries, can, be, found, in, acidic, bogs, throughout, the, cooler, regions, of, the, northern, hemisphere, in, 2020, the, u, s, canada, and, chile, accounted, for, 97, of, the, world, production, of, cranberries, most, cranberries, are, processed, into, products, such, as, juice, sauce, jam, and, sweetened, dried, cranberries, with, the, remainder, sold, fresh, to, consumers, cranberry, sauce, is, a, traditional, accompaniment, to, turkey, at, christmas, and, thanksgiving, dinners, in, the, u, s, and, canada, and, at, christmas, dinner, in, the, united, kingdom, cranberries, are, low, creeping, shrubs, or, vines, up, to, 2, meters, 7, ft, long, and, 5, to, 20, centimeters, 2, to, 8, in, in, height, they, have, slender, wiry, stems, that, are, not, thickly, woody, and, have, small, evergreen, leaves, the, flowers, are, dark, pink, with, very, distinct, reflexed, petals, leaving, the, style, and, stamens, fully, exposed, and, pointing, forward, they, are, pollinated, by, bees, the, fruit, is, a, berry, that, is, larger, than, the, leaves, of, the, plant, it, is, initially, light, green, turning, red, when, ripe, it, has, an, acidic, taste, which, usually, overwhelms, its, sweetness, there, are, 4, 5, species, of, cranberry, classified, by, subgenus, cranberries, are, related, to, bilberries, blueberries, and, huckleberries, all, in, vaccinium, subgenus, vaccinium, these, differ, in, having, bell, shaped, flowers, petals, that, are, not, reflexed, and, woodier, stems, forming, taller, shrubs, the, name, cranberry, derives, from, the, middle, low, german, kraanbere, english, translation, craneberry, first, named, as, cranberry, in, english, by, the, missionary, john, eliot, in, 1647, around, 1694, german, and, dutch, colonists, in, new, england, used, the, word, cranberry, to, represent, the, expanding, flower, stem, calyx, and, petals, resembling, the, neck, head, and, bill, of, a, crane, the, traditional, english, name, for, the, plant, more, common, in, europe, vaccinium, oxycoccos, fenberry, originated, from, plants, with, small, red, berries, found, growing, in, fen, marsh, lands, of, england, american, revolutionary, war, veteran, henry, hall, first, cultivated, cranberries, in, the, cape, cod, town, of, dennis, around, 1816, in, the, 1820s, hall, was, shipping, cranberries, to, new, york, city, and, boston, from, which, shipments, were, also, sent, to, europe, in, 1843, eli, howes, planted, his, own, crop, of, cranberries, on, cape, cod, using, the, howes, variety, in, 1847, cyrus, cahoon, planted, a, crop, of, early, black, variety, near, pleasant, lake, harwich, massachusetts, by, 1900, 8, 700, hectares, 21, 500, acres, were, under, cultivation, in, the, new, england, region, in, 2021, the, total, output, of, cranberries, harvested, in, the, united, states, was, 360, 000, metric, tons, 790, million, pounds, with, wisconsin, as, the, largest, state, producer, 59, of, total, followed, by, massachusetts, and, oregon, historically, cranberry, beds, were, constructed, in, wetlands, today, s, cranberry, beds, are, constructed, in, upland, areas, with, a, shallow, water, table, the, topsoil, is, scraped, off, to, form, dykes, around, the, bed, perimeter, clean, sand, is, hauled, in, and, spread, to, a, depth, of, 10, to, 20, centimeters, 4, to, 8, in, the, surface, is, laser, leveled, flat, to, provide, even, drainage, beds, are, frequently, drained, with, socked, tile, in, addition, to, the, perimeter, ditch, in, addition, to, making, it, possible, to, hold, water, the, dykes, allow, equipment, to, service, the, beds, without, driving, on, the, vines, irrigation, equipment, is, installed, in, the, bed, to, provide, irrigation, for, vine, growth, and, for, spring, and, autumn, frost, protection, a, common, misconception, about, cranberry, production, is, that, the, beds, remain, flooded, throughout, the, year, during, the, growing, season, cranberry, beds, are, not, flooded, but, are, irrigated, regularly, to, maintain, soil, moisture, beds, are, flooded, in, the, autumn, to, facilitate, harvest, and, again, during, the, winter, to, protect, against, low, temperatures, in, cold, climates, like, wisconsin, new, england, and, eastern, canada, the, winter, flood, typically, freezes, into, ice, while, in, warmer, climates, the, water, remains, liquid, when, ice, forms, on, the, beds, trucks, can, be, driven, onto, the, ice, to, spread, a, thin, layer, of, sand, to, control, pests, and, rejuvenate, the, vines, sanding, is, done, every, three, to, five, years, cranberry, vines, are, propagated, by, moving, vines, from, an, established, bed, the, vines, are, spread, on, the, surface, of, the, sand, of, the, new, bed, and, pushed, into, the, sand, with, a, blunt, disk, the, vines, are, watered, frequently, during, the, first, few, weeks, until, roots, form, and, new, shoots, grow, beds, are, given, frequent, light, application, of, nitrogen, fertilizer, during, the, first, year, the, cost, of, renovating, cranberry, beds, is, estimated, to, be, between, 74, 000, and, 124, 000, per, hectare, 30, 000, and, 50, 000, per, acre, cranberries, are, harvested, in, the, fall, when, the, fruit, takes, on, its, distinctive, deep, red, color, and, most, ideally, after, the, first, frost, berries, that, receive, sun, turn, a, deep, red, when, fully, ripe, while, those, that, do, not, fully, mature, are, a, pale, pink, or, white, color, this, is, usually, in, september, through, the, first, part, of, november, to, harvest, cranberries, the, beds, are, flooded, with, 15, to, 20, centimeters, 6, to, 8, in, of, water, above, the, vines, a, harvester, is, driven, through, the, beds, to, remove, the, fruit, from, the, vines, for, the, past, 50, years, water, reel, type, harvesters, have, been, used, harvested, cranberries, float, in, the, water, and, can, be, corralled, into, a, corner, of, the, bed, and, conveyed, or, pumped, from, the, bed, from, the, farm, cranberries, are, taken, to, receiving, stations, where, they, are, cleaned, sorted, and, stored, prior, to, packaging, or, processing, while, cranberries, are, harvested, when, they, take, on, their, deep, red, color, they, can, also, be, harvested, beforehand, when, they, are, still, white, which, is, how, white, cranberry, juice, is, made, yields, are, lower, on, beds, harvested, early, and, the, early, flooding, tends, to, damage, vines, but, not, severely, vines, can, also, be, trained, through, dry, picking, to, help, avoid, damage, in, subsequent, harvests, although, most, cranberries, are, wet, picked, as, described, above, 5, 10, of, the, us, crop, is, still, dry, picked, this, entails, higher, labor, costs, and, lower, yield, but, dry, picked, berries, are, less, bruised, and, can, be, sold, as, fresh, fruit, instead, of, having, to, be, immediately, frozen, or, processed, originally, performed, with, two, handed, comb, scoops, dry, picking, is, today, accomplished, by, motorized, walk, behind, harvesters, which, must, be, small, enough, to, traverse, beds, without, damaging, the, vines, cranberries, for, fresh, market, are, stored, in, shallow, bins, or, boxes, with, perforated, or, slatted, bottoms, which, deter, decay, by, allowing, air, to, circulate, because, harvest, occurs, in, late, autumn, cranberries, for, fresh, market, are, frequently, stored, in, thick, walled, barns, without, mechanical, refrigeration, temperatures, are, regulated, by, opening, and, closing, vents, in, the, barn, as, needed, cranberries, destined, for, processing, are, usually, frozen, in, bulk, containers, shortly, after, arriving, at, a, receiving, station, diseases, of, cranberry, include, in, 2022, world, production, of, cranberry, was, 582, 924, tonnes, with, the, united, states, and, canada, together, accounting, for, 99, of, the, total, wisconsin, 59, of, us, production, and, quebec, 60, of, canadian, production, are, two, of, the, largest, producers, of, cranberries, in, the, two, countries, cranberries, are, also, a, major, commercial, crop, in, massachusetts, new, jersey, oregon, and, washington, as, well, as, in, the, canadian, province, of, british, columbia, 33, of, canadian, production, the, anticoagulant, effects, of, warfarin, may, be, increased, by, consuming, cranberry, juice, resulting, in, adverse, effects, such, as, increased, incidence, of, bleeding, and, bruising, other, safety, concerns, from, consuming, large, quantities, of, cranberry, juice, or, using, cranberry, supplements, include, potential, for, nausea, and, increasing, stomach, inflammation, sugar, intake, or, kidney, stone, formation, raw, cranberries, are, 87, water, 12, carbohydrates, and, contain, negligible, protein, and, fat, table, in, a, 100, gram, reference, amount, raw, cranberries, supply, 46, calories, and, moderate, levels, of, vitamin, c, dietary, fiber, and, the, essential, dietary, mineral, manganese, each, with, more, than, 10, of, its, daily, value, other, micronutrients, have, low, content, table, dried, cranberries, are, commonly, processed, with, up, to, 10, times, their, natural, sugar, content, the, drying, process, also, eliminates, vitamin, c,

bearberries, because, bears, ate, them, in, 1648, preacher, john, elliott, was, quoted, in, thomas, shepard, s, book, clear, sunshine, of, the, gospel, with, an, account, of, the, difficulties, the, pilgrims, were, having, in, using, the, indians, to, harvest, cranberries, as, they, preferred, to, hunt, and, fish, in, 1663, the, pilgrim, cookbook, appears, with, a, recipe, for, cranberry, sauce,

alcoholic, cocktails, including, the, cosmopolitan, that, include, cranberry, juice, a, 2023, cochrane, systematic, review, of, 50, studies, concluded, there, is, evidence, that, consuming, cranberry, products, such, as, juice, or, capsules, is, effective, for, reducing, the, risk, of, urinary, tract, infections, utis, in, women, with, recurrent, utis, in, children, and, in, people, susceptible, to, utis, following, clinical, interventions, there, was, little, evidence, of, effect, in, elderly, people, those, with, urination, disorders, or, pregnant, women, when, the, quality, of, meta, analyses, on, the, efficacy, of, consuming, cranberry, products, for, preventing, or, treating, utis, is, examined, with, the, weaker, evidence, that, is, available, large, variation, and, uncertainty, of, effects, are, seen, resulting, from, inconsistencies, of, clinical, research, design, and, inadequate, numbers, of, subjects, in, 2014, the, european, food, safety, authority, reviewed, the, evidence, for, one, brand, of, cranberry, extract, and, concluded, that, a, cause, and, effect, relationship, had, not, been, established, between, cranberry, consumption, and, reduced, risk, of, utis, a, 2022, review, of, international, urology, guidelines, on, uti, found, that, most, clinical, organizations, felt, the, evidence, for, use, of, cranberry, products, to, inhibit, utis, was, conflicting, inconvincing, or, weak, raw, cranberries, cranberry, juice, and, cranberry, extracts, are, a, source, of, polyphenols, including, proanthocyanidins, flavonols, and, quercetin, these, phytochemical, compounds, are, being, studied, in, vivo, and, in, vitro, for, possible, effects, on, the, cardiovascular, system, immune, system, and, cancer, however, there, is, no, confirmation, from, human, studies, that, consuming, cranberry, polyphenols, provides, anti, cancer, immune, or, cardiovascular, benefits, potential, is, limited, by, poor, absorption, and, rapid, excretion, cranberry, juice, contains, a, high, molecular, weight, non, dializable, material, that, is, under, research, for, its, potential, to, affect, formation, of, plaque, by, streptococcus, mutans, pathogens, that, cause, tooth, decay, cranberry, juice, components, are, also, being, studied, for, possible, effects, on, kidney, stone, formation, problems, may, arise, with, the, lack, of, validation, for, quantifying, of, a, type, proanthocyanidins, pac, extracted, from, cranberries, for, instance, pac, extract, quality, and, content, can, be, performed, using, different, methods, including, the, european, pharmacopoeia, method, liquid, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, or, a, modified, 4, dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde, colorimetric, method, variations, in, extract, analysis, can, lead, to, difficulties, in, assessing, the, quality, of, pac, extracts, from, different, cranberry, starting, material, such, as, by, regional, origin, ripeness, at, time, of, harvest, and, post, harvest, processing, assessments, show, that, quality, varies, greatly, from, one, commercial, pac, extract, product, to, another, cranberry, sales, in, the, united, states, have, traditionally, been, associated, with, holidays, of, thanksgiving, and, christmas, in, the, u, s, large, scale, cranberry, cultivation, has, been, developed, as, opposed, to, other, countries, american, cranberry, growers, have, a, long, history, of, cooperative, marketing, as, early, as, 1904, john, gaynor, a, wisconsin, grower, and, a, u, chaney, a, fruit, broker, from, des, moines, iowa, organized, wisconsin, growers, into, a, cooperative, called, the, wisconsin, cranberry, sales, company, to, receive, a, uniform, price, from, buyers, growers, in, new, jersey, and, massachusetts, were, also, organized, into, cooperatives, creating, the, national, fruit, exchange, that, marketed, fruit, under, the, eatmor, brand, the, success, of, cooperative, marketing, almost, led, to, its, failure, with, consistent, and, high, prices, area, and, production, doubled, between, 1903, and, 1917, and, prices, fell, with, surplus, cranberries, and, changing, american, households, some, enterprising, growers, began, canning, cranberries, that, were, below, grade, for, fresh, market, competition, between, canners, was, fierce, because, profits, were, thin, the, ocean, spray, cooperative, was, established, in, 1930, through, a, merger, of, three, primary, processing, companies, ocean, spray, preserving, company, makepeace, preserving, co, and, cranberry, products, co, the, new, company, was, called, cranberry, canners, inc, and, used, the, ocean, spray, label, on, their, products, since, the, new, company, represented, over, 90, of, the, market, it, would, have, been, illegal, under, american, antitrust, laws, had, attorney, john, quarles, not, found, an, exemption, for, agricultural, cooperatives, as, of, 2006, about, 65, of, the, north, american, industry, belongs, to, the, ocean, spray, cooperative, in, 1958, morris, april, brothers, who, produced, eatmor, brand, cranberry, sauce, in, tuckahoe, new, jersey, brought, an, action, against, ocean, spray, for, violation, of, the, sherman, antitrust, act, and, won, 200, 000, in, real, damages, plus, triple, damages, just, in, time, for, the, great, cranberry, scare, on, 9, november, 1959, secretary, of, the, united, states, department, of, health, education, and, welfare, arthur, s, flemming, announced, that, some, of, the, 1959, cranberry, crop, was, tainted, with, traces, of, the, herbicide, aminotriazole, the, market, for, cranberries, collapsed, and, growers, lost, millions, of, dollars, however, the, scare, taught, the, industry, that, they, could, not, be, completely, dependent, on, the, holiday, market, for, their, products, they, had, to, find, year, round, markets, for, their, fruit, they, also, had, to, be, exceedingly, careful, about, their, use, of, pesticides, after, the, aminotriazole, scare, ocean, spray, reorganized, and, spent, substantial, sums, on, product, development, new, products, such, as, cranberry, apple, juice, blends, were, introduced, followed, by, other, juice, blends, prices, and, production, increased, steadily, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, prices, peaked, at, about, 65, 00, per, barrel, 0, 65, per, pound, or, 1, 43, per, kilogram, a, cranberry, barrel, equals, 100, pounds, or, 45, 4, kilograms, in, 1996, then, fell, to, 18, 00, per, barrel, 0, 18, per, pound, or, 0, 40, per, kilogram, in, 2001, the, cause, for, the, precipitous, drop, was, classic, oversupply, production, had, outpaced, consumption, leading, to, substantial, inventory, in, freezers, or, as, concentrate, cranberry, handlers, processors, include, ocean, spray, cliffstar, corporation, northland, cranberries, inc, sun, northland, llc, clement, pappas, co, and, decas, cranberry, products, as, well, as, a, number, of, small, handlers, and, processors, the, cranberry, marketing, committee, is, an, organization, that, was, established, in, 1962, as, a, federal, marketing, order, to, ensure, a, stable, orderly, supply, of, good, quality, product, the, order, has, been, renewed, and, modified, slightly, over, the, years, the, market, order, has, been, invoked, during, six, crop, years, 1962, 12, 1963, 5, 1970, 10, 1971, 12, 2000, 15, and, 2001, 35, even, though, supply, still, exceeds, demand, there, is, little, will, to, invoke, the, federal, marketing, order, out, of, the, realization, that, any, pullback, in, supply, by, u, s, growers, would, easily, be, filled, by, canadian, production, the, cranberry, marketing, committee, based, in, wareham, massachusetts, represents, more, than, 1, 100, cranberry, growers, and, 60, cranberry, handlers, across, massachusetts, rhode, island, connecticut, new, jersey, wisconsin, michigan, minnesota, oregon, washington, and, new, york, long, island, the, authority, for, the, actions, taken, by, the, cranberry, marketing, committee, is, provided, in, chapter, ix, title, 7, code, of, federal, regulations, which, is, called, the, federal, cranberry, marketing, order, the, order, is, part, of, the, agricultural, marketing, agreement, act, of, 1937, identifying, cranberries, as, a, commodity, good, that, can, be, regulated, by, congress, the, federal, cranberry, marketing, order, has, been, altered, over, the, years, to, expand, the, cranberry, marketing, committee, s, ability, to, develop, projects, in, the, united, states, and, around, the, world, the, cranberry, marketing, committee, currently, runs, promotional, programs, in, the, united, states, china, india, mexico, pan, europe, and, south, korea, as, of, 2016, the, european, union, was, the, largest, importer, of, american, cranberries, followed, individually, by, canada, china, mexico, and, south, korea, from, 2013, to, 2017, u, s, cranberry, exports, to, china, grew, exponentially, making, china, the, second, largest, country, importer, reaching, 36, million, in, cranberry, products, the, china, united, states, trade, war, resulted, in, many, chinese, businesses, cutting, off, ties, with, their, u, s, cranberry, suppliers, notes, further, reading, media, related, to, cranberries, at, wikimedia, commons
