poephagus, grunniens, the, yak, bos, grunniens, also, known, as, the, tartary, ox, grunting, ox, or, hairy, cattle, is, a, species, of, long, haired, domesticated, cattle, found, throughout, the, himalayan, region, of, gilgit, baltistan, kashmir, pakistan, nepal, sikkim, india, the, tibetan, plateau, china, tajikistan, and, as, far, north, as, mongolia, and, siberia, it, is, descended, from, the, wild, yak, bos, mutus, the, english, word, yak, originates, from, the, tibetan, wylie, g, yag, in, tibetan, and, balti, it, refers, only, to, the, male, of, the, species, the, female, being, called, tibetan, wylie, bri, tibetan, wylie, dri, or, tibetan, wylie, g, nag, in, tibetan, and, tibetan, wylie, hyag, mo, in, balti, in, english, as, in, most, other, languages, that, have, borrowed, the, word, yak, is, usually, used, for, both, sexes, with, bull, or, cow, referring, to, each, sex, separately, belonging, to, the, genus, bos, yaks, are, related, to, cattle, bos, primigenius, mitochondrial, dna, analyses, to, determine, the, evolutionary, history, of, yaks, have, been, inconclusive, the, yak, may, have, diverged, from, cattle, at, any, point, between, one, and, five, million, years, ago, and, there, is, some, suggestion, that, it, may, be, more, closely, related, to, bison, than, to, the, other, members, of, its, designated, genus, apparent, close, fossil, relatives, of, the, yak, such, as, bos, baikalensis, have, been, found, in, eastern, russia, suggesting, a, possible, route, by, which, yak, like, ancestors, of, the, modern, american, bison, could, have, entered, the, americas, the, species, was, originally, designated, as, bos, grunniens, grunting, ox, by, linnaeus, in, 1766, but, this, name, is, now, generally, considered, to, refer, only, to, the, domesticated, form, of, the, animal, with, bos, mutus, mute, ox, being, the, preferred, name, for, the, wild, species, although, some, authors, still, consider, the, wild, yak, to, be, a, subspecies, bos, grunniens, mutus, the, iczn, made, an, official, ruling, in, 2003, permitting, the, use, of, the, name, bos, mutus, for, wild, yaks, and, this, is, now, the, more, common, usage, except, where, the, wild, yak, is, considered, as, a, subspecies, of, bos, grunniens, there, are, no, recognised, subspecies, of, yak, yaks, are, heavily, built, animals, with, bulky, frames, sturdy, legs, rounded, cloven, hooves, and, extremely, dense, long, fur, that, hangs, down, lower, than, the, belly, while, wild, yaks, are, generally, dark, blackish, to, brown, in, colouration, domestic, yaks, can, be, quite, variable, in, colour, often, having, patches, of, rusty, brown, and, cream, they, have, small, ears, and, wide, foreheads, with, smooth, horns, that, are, generally, dark, in, colour, in, males, bulls, the, horns, sweep, out, from, the, sides, of, the, head, and, then, curve, backward, they, typically, range, from, 48, to, 99, cm, 19, to, 39, in, in, length, the, horns, of, females, cows, are, smaller, at, 27, to, 64, cm, 11, to, 25, in, in, length, and, have, a, more, upright, shape, both, sexes, have, a, short, neck, with, a, pronounced, hump, over, the, shoulders, although, this, is, larger, and, more, visible, in, males, males, weigh, 350, to, 585, kg, 772, to, 1, 290, lb, females, weigh, 225, to, 255, kg, 496, to, 562, lb, wild, yaks, can, be, substantially, heavier, bulls, reaching, weights, of, up, to, 1, 000, kilograms, 2, 200, lb, depending, on, the, breed, domestic, yak, males, are, 111, 138, centimetres, 44, 54, in, high, at, the, withers, while, females, are, 105, 117, centimetres, 41, 46, in, high, at, the, withers, both, sexes, have, long, shaggy, hair, with, a, dense, woolly, undercoat, over, the, chest, flanks, and, thighs, to, insulate, them, from, the, cold, especially, in, bulls, this, may, form, a, long, skirt, that, can, reach, the, ground, the, tail, is, long, and, horselike, rather, than, tufted, like, the, tails, of, cattle, or, bison, domesticated, yaks, have, a, wide, range, of, coat, colours, with, some, individuals, being, white, grey, brown, roan, or, piebald, the, udder, in, females, and, the, scrotum, in, males, are, small, and, hairy, as, protection, against, the, cold, females, have, four, teats, yaks, are, not, known, to, produce, the, characteristic, lowing, mooing, sound, of, cattle, but, both, wild, and, domestic, yaks, grunt, and, squeak, which, inspired, the, scientific, name, of, the, domestic, yak, variant, bos, grunniens, grunting, bull, nikolay, przhevalsky, named, the, wild, variant, bos, mutus, silent, bull, believing, that, it, did, not, make, a, sound, at, all, but, it, does, yak, physiology, is, well, adapted, to, high, altitudes, having, larger, lungs, and, heart, than, cattle, found, at, lower, altitudes, as, well, as, greater, capacity, for, transporting, oxygen, through, their, blood, due, to, the, persistence, of, foetal, haemoglobin, throughout, life, conversely, yaks, have, trouble, thriving, at, lower, altitudes, and, are, prone, to, suffering, from, heat, exhaustion, above, about, 15, c, 59, f, further, adaptations, to, the, cold, include, a, thick, layer, of, subcutaneous, fat, and, an, almost, complete, lack, of, functional, sweat, glands, compared, with, domestic, cattle, the, rumen, of, yaks, is, unusually, large, relative, to, the, omasum, this, likely, allows, them, to, consume, greater, quantities, of, low, quality, food, at, a, time, and, to, ferment, it, longer, so, as, to, extract, more, nutrients, yak, consume, the, equivalent, of, 1, of, their, body, weight, daily, while, cattle, require, 3, to, maintain, condition, they, are, grazing, herbivores, with, their, wild, ancestors, feeding, primarily, on, grass, and, sedges, with, some, herbs, and, dwarf, shrubs, yaks, mate, in, the, summer, typically, between, july, and, september, depending, on, the, local, environment, for, the, remainder, of, the, year, many, bulls, wander, in, small, bachelor, groups, away, from, the, large, herds, but, as, the, rut, approaches, they, become, aggressive, and, regularly, fight, among, each, other, to, establish, dominance, in, addition, to, non, violent, threat, displays, bellowing, and, scraping, the, ground, with, their, horns, bull, yaks, also, compete, more, directly, repeatedly, charging, at, each, other, with, heads, lowered, or, sparring, with, their, horns, like, bison, but, unlike, cattle, males, wallow, in, dry, soil, during, the, rut, often, while, scent, marking, with, urine, or, dung, females, enter, oestrus, up, to, four, times, a, year, and, females, are, receptive, only, for, a, few, hours, in, each, cycle, gestation, lasts, between, 257, and, 270, days, so, that, the, young, are, born, between, may, and, june, and, results, in, the, birth, of, a, single, calf, the, cow, finds, a, secluded, spot, to, give, birth, but, the, calf, is, able, to, walk, within, about, ten, minutes, of, birth, and, the, pair, soon, rejoin, the, herd, females, of, both, the, wild, and, domestic, forms, typically, give, birth, only, once, every, other, year, although, more, frequent, births, are, possible, if, the, food, supply, is, good, calves, are, weaned, at, one, year, and, become, independent, shortly, thereafter, wild, calves, are, initially, brown, in, color, and, only, later, develop, the, darker, adult, hair, females, generally, give, birth, for, the, first, time, at, three, or, four, years, of, age, and, reach, their, peak, reproductive, fitness, at, around, six, years, yaks, may, live, for, more, than, twenty, years, in, domestication, or, captivity, although, it, is, likely, that, this, may, be, somewhat, shorter, in, the, wild, domesticated, yaks, have, been, kept, for, thousands, of, years, primarily, for, their, milk, fibre, wool, and, meat, and, as, beasts, of, burden, their, dried, droppings, are, an, important, fuel, used, all, over, tibet, and, are, often, the, only, fuel, available, on, the, high, treeless, tibetan, plateau, yaks, transport, goods, across, mountain, passes, for, local, farmers, and, traders, and, are, an, attraction, for, climbing, and, trekking, expeditions, only, one, thing, makes, it, hard, to, use, yaks, for, long, journeys, in, barren, regions, they, will, not, eat, grain, which, could, be, carried, on, the, journey, they, will, starve, unless, they, can, be, brought, to, a, place, where, there, is, grass, they, also, are, used, to, draw, ploughs, yaks, milk, is, often, processed, to, a, cheese, called, chhurpi, in, tibetan, and, nepali, languages, and, byaslag, in, mongolia, butter, made, from, yaks, milk, is, an, ingredient, of, the, butter, tea, that, tibetans, consume, in, large, quantities, and, is, also, used, in, lamps, and, made, into, butter, sculptures, used, in, religious, festivities, small, numbers, of, herds, can, be, found, in, the, united, states, and, canada, as, well, as, new, zealand, and, some, parts, of, europe, yaks, have, generated, interest, outside, the, himalayas, as, a, commercial, crop, and, by, cattle, breeders, the, main, interest, of, north, american, yak, breeders, is, lean, meat, production, by, hybridizing, with, other, cattle, followed, by, wool, production, the, indian, government, established, a, dedicated, centre, for, research, into, yak, husbandry, the, icar, national, research, centre, on, yak, in, 1989, it, is, located, at, dirang, arunachal, pradesh, and, maintains, a, yak, farm, in, the, nyukmadung, area, at, an, altitude, of, 2, 750, metres, 9, 020, ft, above, msl, in, nepal, tibet, and, mongolia, domestic, cattle, are, crossbred, with, yaks, this, gives, rise, to, the, infertile, male, dzo, as, well, as, fertile, females, known, as, dzomo, or, zhom, which, may, be, crossed, again, with, cattle, the, dwarf, lulu, breed, the, only, bos, primigenius, taurus, type, of, cattle, in, nepal, has, been, tested, for, dna, markers, and, found, to, be, a, mixture, of, both, taurine, and, zebu, types, of, cattle, b, p, taurus, and, b, p, indicus, with, yak, according, to, the, international, veterinary, information, service, the, low, productivity, of, second, generation, cattle, yak, crosses, makes, them, suitable, only, as, meat, animals, crosses, between, yaks, and, domestic, cattle, bos, primigenius, taurus, have, been, recorded, in, chinese, literature, for, at, least, 2, 000, years, successful, crosses, have, also, been, recorded, between, yak, and, american, bison, gaur, and, banteng, generally, with, similar, results, to, those, produced, with, domestic, cattle, jacques, et, al, 2021, show, that, most, elaborate, yak, related, terminologies, are, found, within, tibetic, and, gyalrongic, languages, both, branches, also, have, native, terms, for, yak, cattle, hybrids, suggesting, that, tibetic, and, gyalrongic, speakers, may, have, independently, cross, bred, yaks, and, cattle, predating, the, proto, gyalrongic, split, 3221, bp, from, tibeto, gyalrongic, the, oldest, dated, physical, evidence, of, yak, domestication, is, from, 2, 500, years, bp, in, parts, of, tibet, and, karakorum, yak, racing, is, a, form, of, entertainment, at, traditional, festivals, and, is, considered, an, important, part, of, their, culture, more, recently, sports, involving, domesticated, yaks, such, as, yak, skiing, or, yak, polo, are, being, marketed, as, tourist, attractions, in, south, asian, countries, including, in, gilgit, baltistan, pakistan, in, nepal, there, is, an, annual, festival, held, to, drink, the, fresh, blood, of, yak, in, the, belief, that, it, cures, varieties, of, diseases, such, as, gastritis, jaundice, and, body, strain, the, fresh, blood, is, extracted, from, the, neck, of, a, yak, without, killing, it, the, cut, is, healed, after, the, ceremony, is, over, the, ritual, is, believed, to, be, originated, in, tibet, and, mustang
