the, gila, monster, heloderma, suspectum, h, i, l, hee, l, is, a, species, of, venomous, lizard, native, to, the, southwestern, united, states, and, the, northwestern, mexican, state, of, sonora, it, is, a, heavy, slow, moving, reptile, up, to, 56, centimetres, 22, in, long, and, it, is, the, only, venomous, lizard, native, to, the, united, states, its, venomous, close, relatives, the, four, beaded, lizards, all, former, subspecies, of, heloderma, horridum, inhabit, mexico, and, guatemala, the, gila, monster, is, sluggish, in, nature, so, it, is, not, generally, dangerous, and, very, rarely, poses, a, real, threat, to, humans, however, it, has, a, fearsome, reputation, and, is, sometimes, killed, despite, the, species, being, protected, by, state, law, in, arizona, the, name, gila, refers, to, the, gila, river, basin, in, the, u, s, states, of, arizona, and, new, mexico, where, the, gila, monster, was, once, plentiful, heloderma, means, studded, skin, from, the, ancient, greek, words, helos, the, head, of, a, nail, or, stud, and, derma, skin, the, species, epithet, suspectum, comes, from, the, describer, paleontologist, edward, drinker, cope, at, first, this, new, specimen, of, heloderma, was, misidentified, and, considered, to, be, a, northern, variation, of, the, beaded, lizard, already, known, to, live, in, mexico, he, suspected, that, the, lizard, might, be, venomous, due, to, the, grooves, in, the, teeth, the, gila, monster, is, the, largest, extant, lizard, species, native, to, north, america, north, of, the, mexican, border, its, snout, to, vent, length, ranges, from, 26, to, 36, cm, 10, to, 14, in, the, tail, is, about, 20, of, the, body, size, and, the, largest, specimens, may, reach, 51, to, 56, cm, 20, to, 22, in, in, total, length, body, mass, is, typically, in, the, range, of, 550, to, 800, g, 1, 21, to, 1, 76, lb, they, appear, strong, in, their, body, structure, with, a, stout, snout, massive, head, and, little, appearing, eyes, which, can, be, protected, by, a, nictitating, membrane, the, gila, monster, has, four, close, living, relatives, all, of, which, are, beaded, lizards, there, are, three, species, in, mexico, heloderma, exasperatum, heloderma, horridum, and, heloderma, alvarezi, as, well, as, another, species, in, guatemala, heloderma, charlesbogerti, the, evolutionary, history, of, the, helodermatidae, may, be, traced, back, to, the, cretaceous, period, 145, to, 166, million, years, ago, when, gobiderma, pulchrum, and, estesia, mongolensis, were, present, the, genus, heloderma, has, existed, since, the, miocene, when, h, texana, lived, fragments, of, osteoderms, from, the, gila, monster, have, been, found, in, late, pleistocene, 10, 000, to, 8, 000, years, ago, deposits, near, las, vegas, nevada, because, the, helodermatids, have, remained, relatively, unchanged, morphologically, they, are, occasionally, regarded, as, living, fossils, although, the, gila, monster, appears, closely, related, to, the, monitor, lizards, varanids, of, africa, asia, and, australia, their, wide, geographical, separation, and, distinct, features, indicate, that, heloderma, is, better, placed, in, a, separate, family, the, scales, of, the, head, back, and, tail, contain, little, pearl, shaped, bones, osteoderms, similar, to, those, found, in, the, beaded, lizards, from, further, south, the, scales, of, the, belly, are, free, from, osteoderms, female, gila, monsters, go, through, a, total, shed, lasting, about, 2, weeks, before, depositing, their, eggs, the, dorsal, part, is, often, shed, in, one, large, piece, adult, males, normally, shed, in, smaller, segments, in, august, the, young, seem, to, be, in, constant, shed, adults, have, more, or, less, yellow, to, pink, colors, on, a, black, surface, hatchlings, have, a, uniform, simple, and, less, colorful, pattern, this, drastically, changes, within, the, first, 6, months, of, their, lives, hatchlings, from, the, northern, area, of, the, species, distribution, have, a, tendency, to, retain, most, of, their, juvenile, pattern, it, has, also, been, seen, that, gila, monsters, in, areas, with, darker, rocks, and, substrate, will, have, darker, colorations, the, heads, of, males, are, very, often, larger, and, more, triangular, shaped, than, in, females, the, length, of, the, tail, of, the, two, sexes, is, statistically, very, similar, so, it, does, not, help, in, differentiation, of, the, sexes, individuals, with, stout, tail, ends, occur, in, both, nature, and, under, human, breeding, the, gila, monster, is, found, in, the, southwestern, united, states, and, mexico, across, a, range, including, sonora, arizona, and, parts, of, california, nevada, utah, and, new, mexico, no, records, have, been, given, from, baja, california, they, inhabit, scrubland, succulent, desert, and, oak, woodland, seeking, shelter, in, burrows, thickets, and, under, rocks, in, locations, with, a, favorable, microclimate, and, adequate, humidity, gila, monsters, rely, heavily, on, the, use, of, shelters, and, spend, much, of, their, time, dwelling, there, often, times, these, shelters, are, in, rocky, areas, in, navajo, sandstone, and, basaltic, lava, flows, gila, monsters, depend, on, water, resources, and, can, be, observed, in, puddles, of, water, after, a, summer, rain, they, avoid, living, in, open, areas, such, as, flats, and, open, grasslands, gila, monsters, spend, 90, of, their, lifetime, underground, in, burrows, or, rocky, shelters, they, are, active, in, the, morning, during, the, dry, season, spring, and, early, summer, the, lizards, move, to, different, shelters, every, 4, 5, days, up, to, the, beginning, of, the, summer, season, by, doing, so, they, optimize, for, a, suitable, microhabitat, later, in, the, summer, they, may, be, active, on, warm, nights, or, after, a, thunderstorm, they, maintain, a, surface, body, temperature, of, about, 30, c, 86, f, close, to, 37, c, 99, f, they, are, able, to, decrease, their, body, temperature, by, up, to, 2, c, 3, 6, f, by, an, activated, limited, evaporation, via, the, cloaca, one, study, investigating, a, population, of, gila, monsters, in, southwestern, utah, noted, that, the, lizard, s, activity, peaked, from, late, april, to, mid, june, the, average, distance, traveled, during, their, bouts, of, activity, was, 210, metres, 690, ft, but, on, occasion, some, lizards, would, travel, distances, greater, than, 1, kilometre, 0, 62, mi, during, the, gila, monster, s, active, season, of, approximately, 90, days, only, ten, days, were, spent, active, gila, monsters, are, slow, sprinters, but, they, have, relatively, high, endurance, and, maximal, aerobic, capacity, vo, 2, max, compared, to, other, lizards, they, are, preyed, upon, by, coyotes, badgers, and, raptors, hatchlings, are, preyed, on, by, snakes, such, as, kingsnakes, lampropeltis, sp, among, adaptations, to, a, dry, environment, is, a, slow, metabolism, allowing, them, to, use, less, than, half, the, amount, of, energy, expected, for, lizards, of, their, size, gila, monsters, and, possibly, also, the, mexican, beaded, lizard, store, water, in, their, urinary, bladder, and, reabsorb, it, across, the, bladder, epithelium, their, tail, is, used, for, energy, storage, in, the, form, of, fat, the, gila, monster, s, diet, consists, of, a, variety, of, food, items, small, mammals, such, as, young, rabbits, hares, mice, ground, squirrels, and, other, rodents, small, birds, snakes, lizards, frogs, insects, other, invertebrates, carrion, and, the, eggs, of, birds, lizards, snakes, and, tortoises, three, to, four, extensive, meals, in, spring, are, claimed, to, give, them, enough, energy, for, a, whole, season, they, can, store, fat, in, their, tails, and, therefore, do, not, need, to, eat, often, nevertheless, they, feed, whenever, they, come, across, suitable, prey, young, gila, monsters, can, swallow, up, to, 50, of, their, body, weight, in, a, single, meal, adults, may, eat, up, to, one, third, of, their, body, weight, in, one, meal, the, gila, monster, uses, its, extremely, acute, sense, of, smell, to, locate, prey, the, strong, two, ended, tipped, tongue, which, is, pigmented, in, black, blue, colors, picks, up, scent, molecules, to, be, transferred, to, the, opening, of, the, jacobson, organ, around, the, middle, of, the, upper, mouth, cavern, prey, may, be, crushed, to, death, if, large, or, eaten, alive, most, of, the, time, head, first, and, helped, down, by, muscular, contractions, and, neck, flexing, after, food, has, been, swallowed, the, gila, monster, may, immediately, resume, tongue, flicking, and, search, behavior, for, identifying, more, prey, such, as, eggs, or, young, in, nests, gila, monsters, are, able, to, climb, trees, cacti, and, even, fairly, straight, rough, surfaced, walls, i, have, never, been, called, to, attend, a, case, of, gila, monster, bite, and, i, don, t, want, to, be, i, think, a, man, who, is, fool, enough, to, get, bitten, by, a, gila, monster, ought, to, die, the, creature, is, so, sluggish, and, slow, of, movement, that, the, victim, of, its, bite, is, compelled, to, help, largely, in, order, to, get, bitten, dr, ward, arizona, graphic, september, 23, 1899, in, the, old, west, the, pioneers, believed, a, number, of, myths, about, the, gila, monster, including, that, the, lizard, had, foul, or, toxic, breath, and, that, its, bite, was, fatal, the, tombstone, epitaph, of, tombstone, arizona, wrote, about, a, gila, monster, that, a, local, person, caught, on, may, 14, 1881, this, is, a, monster, and, no, baby, at, that, it, being, probably, the, largest, specimen, ever, captured, in, arizona, it, is, 27, inches, long, and, weighs, 35, lb, it, was, caught, by, h, c, hiatt, on, the, road, between, tombstone, and, grand, central, mill, and, was, purchased, by, messrs, ed, baker, and, charles, eastman, who, now, have, it, on, exhibition, at, kelley, s, wine, house, next, door, above, grand, hotel, allen, street, eastern, people, who, have, never, seen, one, of, these, monsters, should, not, fail, to, inspect, his, aztecship, for, they, might, accidentally, stumble, upon, one, some, fine, day, and, get, badly, frightened, except, they, know, what, it, is, on, may, 8, 1890, southeast, of, tucson, arizona, territory, empire, ranch, owner, walter, vail, captured, and, thought, he, had, killed, a, gila, monster, he, tied, it, to, his, saddle, and, it, bit, the, middle, finger, of, his, right, hand, and, would, not, let, go, a, ranch, hand, pried, open, the, lizard, s, mouth, with, a, pocket, knife, cut, open, his, finger, to, stimulate, bleeding, and, then, tied, saddle, strings, around, his, finger, and, wrist, they, summoned, dr, john, c, handy, of, tucson, who, took, vail, back, to, tucson, for, treatment, but, vail, experienced, swollen, and, bleeding, glands, in, his, throat, for, sometime, afterward, dr, handy, s, friend, dr, george, goodfellow, of, tombstone, was, among, the, first, to, research, the, actual, effects, of, gila, monster, venom, scientific, american, reported, in, 1890, the, breath, is, very, fetid, and, its, odor, can, be, detected, at, some, little, distance, from, the, lizard, it, is, supposed, that, this, is, one, way, in, which, the, monster, catches, the, insects, and, small, animals, which, form, a, part, of, its, food, supply, the, foul, gas, overcoming, them, goodfellow, offered, to, pay, local, residents, 5, 00, for, gila, monster, specimens, he, bought, several, and, collected, more, on, his, own, in, 1891, he, purposely, provoked, one, of, his, captive, lizards, into, biting, him, on, his, finger, the, bite, made, him, ill, and, he, spent, the, next, five, days, in, bed, but, he, completely, recovered, when, scientific, american, ran, another, ill, founded, report, on, the, lizard, s, ability, to, kill, people, he, wrote, in, reply, and, described, his, own, studies, and, personal, experience, he, wrote, that, he, knew, several, people, who, had, been, bitten, by, gila, monsters, but, had, not, died, from, the, bite, the, gila, monster, produces, venom, in, modified, salivary, glands, at, the, end, of, its, lower, jaws, unlike, snakes, whose, venom, is, produced, in, glands, behind, the, eyes, the, gila, monster, lacks, strong, musculature, in, glands, above, the, eyes, instead, in, heloderma, the, venom, is, propelled, from, the, gland, via, a, tubing, to, the, base, of, the, lower, teeth, and, then, by, capillary, forces, into, two, grooves, of, the, tooth, and, then, chewed, into, the, victim, the, teeth, are, tightly, anchored, to, the, jaw, pleurodont, broken, and, regular, replacement, teeth, have, to, wait, every, time, to, go, into, position, in, a, determinate, wavelike, sequence, they, change, replace, their, teeth, during, their, entire, life, the, gila, monster, s, bright, colors, might, be, suitable, to, teach, predators, not, to, bother, this, painful, creature, because, the, gila, monster, s, prey, consists, mainly, of, eggs, small, animals, and, otherwise, helpless, prey, the, gila, monster, s, venom, is, thought, to, have, evolved, for, defensive, rather, than, for, hunting, use, the, venom, of, a, gila, monster, is, normally, not, fatal, to, healthy, adult, humans, one, fatality, has, been, confirmed, since, 1930, on, february, 16, 2024, and, the, rare, fatalities, recorded, before, 1930, occurred, in, adults, who, were, intoxicated, by, alcohol, or, had, mismanaged, the, treatment, of, the, bite, the, gila, monster, can, bite, quickly, and, may, not, release, the, victim, without, intervention, if, bitten, the, victim, may, attempt, to, fully, submerge, the, lizard, in, water, pry, the, jaws, open, with, a, knife, or, stick, or, physically, yank, the, lizard, free, while, pulling, the, lizard, directly, increases, risk, of, severe, lacerations, from, the, lizard, s, sharp, teeth, it, may, also, mitigate, envenomation, symptoms, of, the, bite, include, excruciating, pain, edema, and, weakness, associated, with, a, rapid, drop, in, blood, pressure, youtuber, coyote, peterson, described, the, bite, as, like, hot, lava, coursing, through, your, veins, and, claimed, it, was, the, worst, pain, had, ever, experienced, it, is, generally, regarded, as, the, most, painful, venom, produced, by, any, vertebrate, more, than, a, dozen, peptides, and, other, substances, have, been, isolated, from, the, gila, monster, s, venom, including, hyaluronidase, serotonin, phospholipase, a, 2, and, several, kallikrein, like, glycoproteins, responsible, for, the, pain, and, edema, caused, by, a, bite, without, producing, a, compartment, syndrome, four, potentially, lethal, toxins, have, been, isolated, from, the, gila, monster, s, venom, which, cause, hemorrhage, in, internal, organs, and, exophthalmos, bulging, of, the, eyes, and, helothermine, which, causes, lethargy, partial, paralysis, of, the, limbs, and, hypothermia, in, rats, some, are, similar, in, action, of, the, vasoactive, intestinal, peptide, vip, which, relaxes, smooth, muscle, and, regulates, water, and, electrolyte, secretion, between, the, small, and, large, intestines, these, bioactive, peptides, are, able, to, bind, to, vip, receptors, in, many, different, human, tissues, one, of, these, helodermin, has, been, shown, to, inhibit, the, growth, of, lung, cancer, in, february, 2024, a, colorado, man, died, after, sustaining, a, 4, minute, long, bite, from, a, pet, gila, monster, autopsy, reports, determined, cause, of, death, to, come, from, the, animal, bite, venom, the, constituents, of, h, suspectum, venom, that, have, received, the, most, attention, from, researchers, are, the, bioactive, peptides, including, helodermin, helospectin, exendin, 3, and, exendin, 4, exendin, 4, which, is, specific, for, h, suspectum, has, formed, the, basis, of, a, class, of, medications, for, the, treatment, of, type, 2, diabetes, known, as, glucagon, like, peptide, 1, agonists, in, 2005, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, approved, the, drug, exenatide, marketed, as, byetta, for, the, management, of, type, 2, diabetes, it, is, a, synthetic, blueprint, of, the, protein, exendin, 4, isolated, from, the, gila, monster, s, venom, in, a, 3, year, study, with, people, with, type, 2, diabetes, exenatide, showed, healthy, sustained, glucose, levels, the, effectiveness, is, because, the, lizard, protein, is, 53, identical, to, glucagon, like, peptide, 1, analog, glp, 1, a, hormone, released, from, the, human, digestive, tract, that, helps, to, regulate, insulin, and, glucagon, using, a, sophisticated, injection, formula, with, sustained, release, of, the, drug, the, lizard, protein, remains, effective, much, longer, than, the, human, hormone, this, helps, diabetics, keep, their, blood, glucose, levels, under, control, for, a, week, by, a, single, injection, exenatide, also, slows, the, emptying, of, the, stomach, and, causes, a, decrease, in, appetite, contributing, to, weight, loss, the, antidiabetic, exenatide, byetta, from, the, venomous, gila, monster, is, also, an, example, of, a, medical, value, of, venom, peptides, targeting, g, protein, coupled, receptors, gpcrs, the, gila, monster, emerges, from, brumation, in, early, march, gila, monsters, sexually, mature, at, 4, 5, years, old, it, mates, in, april, and, may, the, male, initiates, courtship, by, flicking, his, tongue, to, search, for, the, female, s, scent, if, the, female, rejects, his, advances, she, will, bite, him, and, chase, him, away, when, successful, copulation, has, been, observed, in, captivity, to, last, from, 15, minutes, to, two, and, a, half, hours, there, is, only, a, single, record, of, attempted, mating, outside, of, a, shelter, the, female, lays, eggs, at, the, end, of, may, into, june, a, clutch, may, consist, of, up, to, eight, rarely, more, than, six, eggs, the, incubation, in, captivity, lasts, about, 5, months, depending, on, the, incubation, temperature, the, hatchlings, are, about, 16, cm, 6, 3, in, long, and, can, bite, and, inject, venom, as, soon, as, they, are, hatched, the, egg, development, and, hatching, time, of, young, in, the, wild, has, been, a, subject, of, ongoing, speculation, the, first, model, stated, that, youngsters, hatch, in, fall, and, stay, underground, the, second, theory, postulated, a, nearly, developed, embryo, remains, inside, the, egg, over, winter, and, hatches, in, spring, hatchlings, weight, about, 35, g, 1, 2, oz, are, observed, at, the, end, of, april, to, early, june, discussions, of, the, exact, egg, development, and, hatching, cycle, of, the, gila, monster, came, to, an, abrupt, and, unexpected, end, on, october, 28, 2016, when, a, backhoe, was, digging, at, the, outer, walls, of, a, house, in, a, suburb, of, northern, tucson, the, backhoe, extracted, a, nest, of, a, female, gila, monster, with, five, eggs, in, the, process, of, hatching, the, gila, monster, is, now, known, to, hatch, near, the, end, of, october, and, immediately, proceed, into, hibernation, without, surfacing, they, then, appear, on, the, surface, from, may, through, june, the, following, year, when, prey, should, be, abundant, in, summer, gila, monsters, gradually, spend, less, time, on, the, surface, to, avoid, the, hottest, part, of, the, season, occasionally, they, may, be, active, at, night, females, that, have, laid, eggs, are, exhausted, and, thin, fighting, for, survival, and, have, to, spend, extra, effort, to, reconstitute, the, brumation, of, gila, monsters, begins, in, october, gila, monsters, can, live, up, to, 40, years, in, captivity, though, rarely, little, is, known, about, the, social, behavior, of, gila, monster, but, it, has, been, observed, engaging, in, male, to, male, combat, in, which, the, dominant, male, lies, on, top, of, the, subordinate, one, and, pins, it, with, its, front, and, hind, limbs, while, fighting, both, lizards, arch, their, bodies, pushing, against, each, other, and, twisting, around, in, an, effort, to, gain, the, dominant, position, a, wrestling, match, ends, when, the, pressure, exerts, their, forces, although, bouts, may, be, repeated, these, bouts, are, typically, observed, in, the, mating, season, males, with, greater, strength, and, endurance, are, thought, to, enjoy, greater, reproductive, success, although, the, gila, monster, has, a, low, metabolism, and, one, of, the, lowest, lizard, sprint, speeds, it, has, one, of, the, highest, aerobic, scope, values, the, increase, in, oxygen, consumption, from, rest, to, maximum, metabolic, exertion, among, lizards, allowing, it, to, engage, in, intense, aerobic, activity, for, a, sustained, period, of, time, gila, monsters, are, listed, as, near, threatened, by, the, iucn, they, are, listed, as, apparently, secure, by, natureserve, in, 1952, the, gila, monster, became, the, first, venomous, animal, to, be, given, legal, protection, they, are, now, protected, in, all, states, of, their, distribution, international, trade, in, the, species, is, regulated, under, appendix, ii, of, cites, possibly, the, greatest, threat, to, the, continued, existence, of, helodermatids, is, the, man, made, destruction, of, their, habitat, as, the, land, is, developed, for, construction, or, to, create, more, cultivable, land, gila, monsters, found, in, these, situations, and, relocated, with, best, intentions, up, to, 1, 2, km, 0, 75, mi, away, return, to, where, they, were, found, within, 2, months, and, at, great, effort, this, is, up, to, five, times, the, normal, energy, use, than, if, they, had, not, been, removed, which, uses, up, their, energy, stores, unnecessarily, the, same, is, true, for, animals, relocated, to, appropriate, habitats, besides, this, they, also, become, more, exposed, to, predators, therefore, the, process, of, simple, relocation, is, na, ve, and, potentially, dangerous, for, both, the, relocated, animals, and, existing, populations, and, for, the, inhabitants, of, the, region, where, the, resettlement, is, taking, place, if, relocating, the, lizards, further, away, they, might, be, totally, disoriented, thus, their, survival, is, still, very, questionable, a, more, successful, strategy, would, be, for, example, if, the, new, settlers, were, offered, intensive, education, about, this, species, e, g, limited, toxicity, lifestyle, with, the, aim, of, tolerating, the, reptile, or, even, being, proud, of, having, this, unique, roommate, in, one, s, own, neighborhood, in, 1963, the, san, diego, zoo, became, the, first, zoo, to, successfully, breed, gila, monsters, in, captivity, in, the, last, two, decades, experienced, breeders, have, shared, their, knowledge, and, expertise, to, give, advice, to, other, herpetologists, on, overcoming, the, difficulties, in, heloderma, reproduction, under, human, care, though, the, gila, monster, is, venomous, it, poses, little, threat, to, humans, due, to, its, sluggish, nature, nevertheless, it, has, a, fearsome, reputation, and, is, often, killed, by, humans, myths, that, have, formed, about, the, gila, monster, include, that, the, animal, s, breath, is, toxic, enough, to, kill, humans, that, it, can, spit, venom, like, a, spitting, cobra, that, it, can, leap, several, feet, in, the, air, to, attack, and, that, the, gila, monster, did, not, have, an, anus, and, therefore, expelled, waste, from, its, mouth, the, source, of, its, venom, and, fetid, breath, perhaps, stemming, from, the, fact, that, its, venom, in, fact, has, an, intense, specific, smell, among, native, american, tribes, the, gila, monster, has, a, varied, reputation, the, apache, believed, its, breath, could, kill, a, man, and, the, tohono, o, odham, and, the, pima, believed, it, possessed, a, spiritual, power, that, could, cause, sickness, in, contrast, the, seri, and, the, yaqui, believed, the, gila, monster, s, hide, had, healing, properties, the, navajo, dine, believe, the, gila, monster, was, the, first, medicine, man, the, gila, monster, starred, as, a, monster, in, the, film, the, giant, gila, monster, though, the, titular, monster, was, actually, portrayed, by, a, mexican, beaded, lizard, it, played, a, minor, role, in, the, motion, picture, the, treasure, of, the, sierra, madre, in, brock, brower, s, 1971, novel, the, late, great, creature, fictional, horror, movie, star, simon, moro, is, presented, as, famous, for, playing, the, reptilian, werewolf, like, gila, man, the, 2011, animated, film, rango, featured, a, gila, monster, as, an, old, west, outlaw, named, bad, bill, voiced, by, ray, winstone, the, gila, monster, has, also, seen, usage, as, a, mascot, and, state, symbol, the, official, mascot, of, eastern, arizona, college, located, in, thatcher, arizona, is, gila, hank, a, gun, toting, cowboy, hat, wearing, gila, monster, in, 2017, the, vegas, golden, knights, selected, a, gila, monster, named, chance, as, their, official, mascot, in, 2019, the, state, of, utah, made, the, gila, monster, its, official, state, reptile, in, 2023, australian, band, king, gizzard, and, the, lizard, wizard, released, a, single, titled, gila, monster, from, their, album, petrodragonic, apocalypse, with, the, album, s, artwork, featuring, a, gila, monster, on, its, cover, art, and, heavily, within, the, album, s, concept, narrative
