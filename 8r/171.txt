morphine, formerly, also, called, morphia, is, an, opiate, that, is, found, naturally, in, opium, a, dark, brown, resin, produced, by, drying, the, latex, of, opium, poppies, papaver, somniferum, it, is, mainly, used, as, an, analgesic, pain, medication, there, are, numerous, methods, used, to, administer, morphine, oral, sublingual, via, inhalation, injection, into, a, muscle, injection, under, the, skin, or, injection, into, the, spinal, cord, area, transdermal, or, via, rectal, suppository, it, acts, directly, on, the, central, nervous, system, cns, to, induce, analgesia, and, alter, perception, and, emotional, response, to, pain, physical, and, psychological, dependence, and, tolerance, may, develop, with, repeated, administration, it, can, be, taken, for, both, acute, pain, and, chronic, pain, and, is, frequently, used, for, pain, from, myocardial, infarction, kidney, stones, and, during, labor, its, maximum, effect, is, reached, after, about, 20, minutes, when, administered, intravenously, and, 60, minutes, when, administered, by, mouth, while, the, duration, of, its, effect, is, 3, 7, hours, long, acting, formulations, of, morphine, are, available, as, ms, contin, kadian, and, other, brand, names, as, well, as, generically, potentially, serious, side, effects, of, morphine, include, decreased, respiratory, effort, vomiting, nausea, and, low, blood, pressure, morphine, is, addictive, and, prone, to, abuse, if, one, s, dose, is, reduced, after, long, term, use, opioid, withdrawal, symptoms, may, occur, common, side, effects, of, morphine, include, drowsiness, vomiting, and, constipation, caution, is, advised, for, use, of, morphine, during, pregnancy, or, breast, feeding, as, it, may, affect, the, health, of, the, baby, morphine, was, first, isolated, between, 1803, and, 1805, by, german, pharmacist, friedrich, sert, rner, this, is, believed, to, be, the, first, isolation, of, a, medicinal, alkaloid, from, a, plant, merck, began, marketing, it, commercially, in, 1827, morphine, was, more, widely, used, after, the, invention, of, the, hypodermic, syringe, in, 1853, 1855, sert, rner, originally, named, the, substance, morphium, after, the, greek, god, of, dreams, morpheus, as, it, has, a, tendency, to, cause, sleep, the, primary, source, of, morphine, is, isolation, from, poppy, straw, of, the, opium, poppy, in, 2013, approximately, 523, tons, of, morphine, were, produced, approximately, 45, tons, were, used, directly, for, pain, an, increase, of, 400, over, the, last, twenty, years, most, use, for, this, purpose, was, in, the, developed, world, about, 70, percent, of, morphine, is, used, to, make, other, opioids, such, as, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and, heroin, it, is, a, schedule, ii, drug, in, the, united, states, class, a, in, the, united, kingdom, and, schedule, i, in, canada, it, is, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, morphine, is, sold, under, many, brand, names, in, 2021, it, was, the, 156th, most, commonly, prescribed, medication, in, the, united, states, with, more, than, 3, million, prescriptions, it, is, available, as, a, generic, medication, morphine, is, used, primarily, to, treat, both, acute, and, chronic, severe, pain, its, duration, of, analgesia, is, about, three, to, seven, hours, side, effects, of, nausea, and, constipation, are, rarely, severe, enough, to, warrant, stopping, treatment, it, is, used, for, pain, due, to, myocardial, infarction, and, for, labor, pains, however, concerns, exist, that, morphine, may, increase, mortality, in, the, event, of, non, st, elevation, myocardial, infarction, morphine, has, also, traditionally, been, used, in, the, treatment, of, acute, pulmonary, edema, however, a, 2006, review, found, little, evidence, to, support, this, practice, a, 2016, cochrane, review, concluded, that, morphine, is, effective, in, relieving, cancer, pain, morphine, is, beneficial, in, reducing, the, symptom, of, shortness, of, breath, due, to, both, cancer, and, noncancer, causes, in, the, setting, of, breathlessness, at, rest, or, on, minimal, exertion, from, conditions, such, as, advanced, cancer, or, end, stage, cardiorespiratory, diseases, regular, low, dose, sustained, release, morphine, significantly, reduces, breathlessness, safely, with, its, benefits, maintained, over, time, morphine, is, also, available, as, a, slow, release, formulation, for, opiate, substitution, therapy, ost, in, austria, germany, bulgaria, slovenia, and, canada, for, persons, with, opioid, addiction, who, cannot, tolerate, either, methadone, or, buprenorphine, relative, contraindications, to, morphine, include, like, loperamide, and, other, opioids, morphine, acts, on, the, myenteric, plexus, in, the, intestinal, tract, reducing, gut, motility, causing, constipation, the, gastrointestinal, effects, of, morphine, are, mediated, primarily, by, opioid, receptors, in, the, bowel, by, inhibiting, gastric, emptying, and, reducing, propulsive, peristalsis, of, the, intestine, morphine, decreases, the, rate, of, intestinal, transit, reduction, in, gut, secretion, and, increased, intestinal, fluid, absorption, also, contribute, to, the, constipating, effect, opioids, also, may, act, on, the, gut, indirectly, through, tonic, gut, spasms, after, inhibition, of, nitric, oxide, generation, this, effect, was, shown, in, animals, when, a, nitric, oxide, precursor, l, arginine, reversed, morphine, induced, changes, in, gut, motility, clinical, studies, consistently, conclude, that, morphine, like, other, opioids, often, causes, hypogonadism, and, hormone, imbalances, in, chronic, users, of, both, sexes, this, side, effect, is, dose, dependent, and, occurs, in, both, therapeutic, and, recreational, users, morphine, can, interfere, with, menstruation, by, suppressing, levels, of, luteinizing, hormone, many, studies, suggest, the, majority, perhaps, as, many, as, 90, of, chronic, opioid, users, have, opioid, induced, hypogonadism, this, effect, may, cause, the, increased, likelihood, of, osteoporosis, and, bone, fracture, observed, in, chronic, morphine, users, studies, suggest, the, effect, is, temporary, as, of, 2013, the, effect, of, low, dose, or, acute, use, of, morphine, on, the, endocrine, system, is, unclear, most, reviews, conclude, that, opioids, produce, minimal, impairment, of, human, performance, on, tests, of, sensory, motor, or, attentional, abilities, however, recent, studies, have, been, able, to, show, some, impairments, caused, by, morphine, which, is, not, surprising, given, that, morphine, is, a, central, nervous, system, depressant, morphine, has, resulted, in, impaired, functioning, on, critical, flicker, frequency, a, measure, of, overall, cns, arousal, and, impaired, performance, on, the, maddox, wing, test, a, measure, of, the, deviation, of, the, visual, axes, of, the, eyes, few, studies, have, investigated, the, effects, of, morphine, on, motor, abilities, a, high, dose, of, morphine, can, impair, finger, tapping, and, the, ability, to, maintain, a, low, constant, level, of, isometric, force, i, e, fine, motor, control, is, impaired, though, no, studies, have, shown, a, correlation, between, morphine, and, gross, motor, abilities, in, terms, of, cognitive, abilities, one, study, has, shown, that, morphine, may, have, a, negative, impact, on, anterograde, and, retrograde, memory, but, these, effects, are, minimal, and, transient, overall, it, seems, that, acute, doses, of, opioids, in, non, tolerant, subjects, produce, minor, effects, in, some, sensory, and, motor, abilities, and, perhaps, also, in, attention, and, cognition, it, is, likely, that, the, effects, of, morphine, will, be, more, pronounced, in, opioid, naive, subjects, than, chronic, opioid, users, in, chronic, opioid, users, such, as, those, on, chronic, opioid, analgesic, therapy, coat, for, managing, severe, chronic, pain, behavioural, testing, has, shown, normal, functioning, on, perception, cognition, coordination, and, behaviour, in, most, cases, one, 2000, study, analysed, coat, patients, to, determine, whether, they, were, able, to, safely, operate, a, motor, vehicle, the, findings, from, this, study, suggest, that, stable, opioid, use, does, not, significantly, impair, abilities, inherent, in, driving, this, includes, physical, cognitive, and, perceptual, skills, coat, patients, showed, rapid, completion, of, tasks, that, require, the, speed, of, responding, for, successful, performance, e, g, rey, complex, figure, test, but, made, more, errors, than, controls, coat, patients, showed, no, deficits, in, visual, spatial, perception, and, organization, as, shown, in, the, wais, r, block, design, test, but, did, show, impaired, immediate, and, short, term, visual, memory, as, shown, on, the, rey, complex, figure, test, recall, these, patients, showed, no, impairments, in, higher, order, cognitive, abilities, i, e, planning, coat, patients, appeared, to, have, difficulty, following, instructions, and, showed, a, propensity, toward, impulsive, behaviour, yet, this, did, not, reach, statistical, significance, it, is, important, to, note, that, this, study, reveals, that, coat, patients, have, no, domain, specific, deficits, which, supports, the, notion, that, chronic, opioid, use, has, minor, effects, on, psychomotor, cognitive, or, neuropsychological, functioning, morphine, is, a, highly, addictive, substance, numerous, studies, including, one, by, the, lancet, ranked, morphine, heroin, as, 1, most, addictive, substance, followed, by, cocaine, at, 2, nicotine, 3, followed, by, barbiturates, at, 4, and, ethanol, at, 5, in, controlled, studies, comparing, the, physiological, and, subjective, effects, of, heroin, and, morphine, in, individuals, formerly, addicted, to, opiates, subjects, showed, no, preference, for, one, drug, over, the, other, equipotent, injected, doses, had, comparable, action, courses, with, diacetylmorphine, crossing, the, bbb, slightly, quicker, no, difference, in, subjects, self, rated, feelings, of, euphoria, ambition, nervousness, relaxation, drowsiness, or, sleepiness, short, term, addiction, studies, by, the, same, researchers, demonstrated, that, tolerance, developed, at, a, similar, rate, to, both, heroin, and, morphine, when, compared, to, the, opioids, hydromorphone, fentanyl, oxycodone, and, pethidine, meperidine, former, addicts, showed, a, strong, preference, for, heroin, and, morphine, suggesting, that, heroin, and, morphine, are, particularly, susceptible, to, abuse, and, addiction, morphine, and, heroin, also, produced, higher, rates, of, euphoria, and, other, positive, subjective, effects, when, compared, to, these, other, opioids, the, choice, of, heroin, and, morphine, over, other, opioids, by, former, drug, addicts, may, also, be, because, heroin, also, known, as, morphine, diacetate, diamorphine, or, diacetyl, morphine, is, an, ester, of, morphine, and, a, morphine, prodrug, essentially, meaning, they, are, identical, drugs, in, vivo, heroin, is, converted, to, morphine, before, binding, to, the, opioid, receptors, in, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, where, morphine, causes, the, subjective, effects, which, is, what, the, addicted, individuals, are, seeking, several, hypotheses, are, given, about, how, tolerance, develops, including, opioid, receptor, phosphorylation, which, would, change, the, receptor, conformation, functional, decoupling, of, receptors, from, g, proteins, leading, to, receptor, desensitization, opioid, receptor, internalization, or, receptor, down, regulation, reducing, the, number, of, available, receptors, for, morphine, to, act, on, and, upregulation, of, the, camp, pathway, a, counterregulatory, mechanism, to, opioid, effects, for, a, review, of, these, processes, see, koch, and, hollt, cessation, of, dosing, with, morphine, creates, the, prototypical, opioid, withdrawal, syndrome, which, unlike, that, of, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, alcohol, or, sedative, hypnotics, is, not, fatal, by, itself, in, otherwise, healthy, people, acute, morphine, withdrawal, along, with, that, of, any, other, opioid, proceeds, through, a, number, of, stages, other, opioids, differ, in, the, intensity, and, length, of, each, and, weak, opioids, and, mixed, agonist, antagonists, may, have, acute, withdrawal, syndromes, that, do, not, reach, the, highest, level, as, commonly, cited, they, are, in, advanced, stages, of, withdrawal, ultrasonographic, evidence, of, pancreatitis, has, been, demonstrated, in, some, patients, and, is, presumably, attributed, to, spasm, of, the, pancreatic, sphincter, of, oddi, the, withdrawal, symptoms, associated, with, morphine, addiction, are, usually, experienced, shortly, before, the, time, of, the, next, scheduled, dose, sometimes, within, as, early, as, a, few, hours, usually, 6, h, to, 12, h, after, the, last, administration, early, symptoms, include, watery, eyes, insomnia, diarrhea, runny, nose, yawning, dysphoria, sweating, and, in, some, cases, a, strong, drug, craving, severe, headache, restlessness, irritability, loss, of, appetite, body, aches, severe, abdominal, pain, nausea, and, vomiting, tremors, and, even, stronger, and, more, intense, drug, craving, appear, as, the, syndrome, progresses, severe, depression, and, vomiting, are, very, common, during, the, acute, withdrawal, period, systolic, and, diastolic, blood, pressures, increase, usually, beyond, premorphine, levels, and, heart, rate, increases, which, have, potential, to, cause, a, heart, attack, blood, clot, or, stroke, chills, or, cold, flashes, with, goose, bumps, cold, turkey, alternating, with, flushing, hot, flashes, kicking, movements, of, the, legs, kicking, the, habit, and, excessive, sweating, are, also, characteristic, symptoms, severe, pains, in, the, bones, and, muscles, of, the, back, and, extremities, occur, as, do, muscle, spasms, at, any, point, during, this, process, a, suitable, narcotic, can, be, administered, that, will, dramatically, reverse, the, withdrawal, symptoms, major, withdrawal, symptoms, peak, between, 48, h, and, 96, h, after, the, last, dose, and, subside, after, about, 8, to, 12, days, sudden, withdrawal, by, heavily, dependent, users, who, are, in, poor, health, is, very, rarely, fatal, morphine, withdrawal, is, considered, less, dangerous, than, alcohol, barbiturate, or, benzodiazepine, withdrawal, the, psychological, dependence, associated, with, morphine, addiction, is, complex, and, protracted, long, after, the, physical, need, for, morphine, has, passed, the, addict, will, usually, continue, to, think, and, talk, about, the, use, of, morphine, or, other, drugs, and, feel, strange, or, overwhelmed, coping, with, daily, activities, without, being, under, the, influence, of, morphine, psychological, withdrawal, from, morphine, is, usually, a, very, long, and, painful, process, addicts, often, experience, severe, depression, anxiety, insomnia, mood, swings, amnesia, forgetfulness, low, self, esteem, confusion, paranoia, and, other, psychological, disorders, without, intervention, the, syndrome, will, run, its, course, and, most, of, the, overt, physical, symptoms, will, disappear, within, 7, to, 10, days, including, psychological, dependence, a, high, probability, of, relapse, exists, after, morphine, withdrawal, when, neither, the, physical, environment, nor, the, behavioral, motivators, that, contributed, to, the, abuse, have, been, altered, testimony, to, morphine, s, addictive, and, reinforcing, nature, is, its, relapse, rate, abusers, of, morphine, and, heroin, have, one, of, the, highest, relapse, rates, among, all, drug, users, ranging, up, to, 98, in, the, estimation, of, some, medical, experts, a, large, overdose, can, cause, asphyxia, and, death, by, respiratory, depression, if, the, person, does, not, receive, medical, attention, immediately, overdose, treatment, includes, the, administration, of, naloxone, the, latter, completely, reverses, morphine, s, effects, but, may, result, in, immediate, onset, of, withdrawal, in, opiate, addicted, subjects, multiple, doses, may, be, needed, as, the, duration, of, action, of, morphine, is, longer, than, that, of, naloxone, due, to, its, long, history, and, established, use, as, a, pain, medication, this, compound, has, become, the, benchmark, to, which, all, other, opioids, are, compared, it, interacts, predominantly, with, the, opioid, mu, delta, receptor, heteromer, the, binding, sites, are, discretely, distributed, in, the, human, brain, with, high, densities, in, the, posterior, amygdala, hypothalamus, thalamus, nucleus, caudatus, putamen, and, certain, cortical, areas, they, are, also, found, on, the, terminal, axons, of, primary, afferents, within, laminae, i, and, ii, substantia, gelatinosa, of, the, spinal, cord, and, in, the, spinal, nucleus, of, the, trigeminal, nerve, morphine, is, a, phenanthrene, opioid, receptor, agonist, its, main, effect, is, binding, to, and, activating, the, opioid, receptor, mor, in, the, central, nervous, system, its, intrinsic, activity, at, the, mor, is, heavily, dependent, on, the, assay, and, tissue, being, tested, in, some, situations, it, is, a, full, agonist, while, in, others, it, can, be, a, partial, agonist, or, even, antagonist, in, clinical, settings, morphine, exerts, its, principal, pharmacological, effect, on, the, central, nervous, system, and, gastrointestinal, tract, its, primary, actions, of, therapeutic, value, are, analgesia, and, sedation, activation, of, the, mor, is, associated, with, analgesia, sedation, euphoria, physical, dependence, and, respiratory, depression, morphine, is, also, a, opioid, receptor, kor, and, opioid, receptor, dor, agonist, activation, of, the, kor, is, associated, with, spinal, analgesia, miosis, pinpoint, pupils, and, psychotomimetic, effects, the, dor, is, thought, to, play, a, role, in, analgesia, although, morphine, does, not, bind, to, the, receptor, it, has, been, shown, that, receptor, agonists, such, as, pentazocine, inhibit, morphine, analgesia, and, receptor, antagonists, enhance, morphine, analgesia, suggesting, downstream, involvement, of, the, receptor, in, the, actions, of, morphine, the, effects, of, morphine, can, be, countered, with, opioid, receptor, antagonists, such, as, naloxone, and, naltrexone, the, development, of, tolerance, to, morphine, may, be, inhibited, by, nmda, receptor, antagonists, such, as, ketamine, dextromethorphan, and, memantine, the, rotation, of, morphine, with, chemically, dissimilar, opioids, in, the, long, term, treatment, of, pain, will, slow, down, the, growth, of, tolerance, in, the, longer, run, particularly, agents, known, to, have, significantly, incomplete, cross, tolerance, with, morphine, such, as, levorphanol, ketobemidone, piritramide, and, methadone, and, its, derivatives, all, of, these, drugs, also, have, nmda, antagonist, properties, it, is, believed, that, the, strong, opioid, with, the, most, incomplete, cross, tolerance, with, morphine, is, either, methadone, or, dextromoramide, morphine, creates, analgesia, through, the, activation, of, a, specific, group, of, neurons, in, the, rostral, ventromedial, medulla, called, the, morphine, ensemble, this, ensemble, includes, glutamatergic, neurons, that, project, to, spinal, cord, known, as, rvm, bdnf, neurons, these, neurons, connect, to, inhibitory, neurons, in, the, spinal, cord, called, sc, gal, neurons, which, release, the, neurotransmitter, gaba, and, the, neuropeptide, galanin, the, inhibition, of, sc, gal, neurons, is, crucial, for, morphine, s, pain, relieving, effects, additionally, the, neurotrophic, factor, bdnf, produced, within, the, rvm, bdnf, neurons, is, required, for, morphine, s, action, increasing, bdnf, levels, enhances, morphine, s, analgesic, effects, even, at, lower, doses, studies, have, shown, that, morphine, can, alter, the, expression, of, a, number, of, genes, a, single, injection, of, morphine, has, been, shown, to, alter, the, expression, of, two, major, groups, of, genes, for, proteins, involved, in, mitochondrial, respiration, and, for, cytoskeleton, related, proteins, morphine, has, long, been, known, to, act, on, receptors, expressed, on, cells, of, the, central, nervous, system, resulting, in, pain, relief, and, analgesia, in, the, 1970s, and, 80s, evidence, suggesting, that, opioid, drug, addicts, show, increased, risk, of, infection, such, as, increased, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and, hiv, aids, led, scientists, to, believe, that, morphine, may, also, affect, the, immune, system, this, possibility, increased, interest, in, the, effect, of, chronic, morphine, use, on, the, immune, system, the, first, step, of, determining, that, morphine, may, affect, the, immune, system, was, to, establish, that, the, opiate, receptors, known, to, be, expressed, on, cells, of, the, central, nervous, system, are, also, expressed, on, cells, of, the, immune, system, one, study, successfully, showed, that, dendritic, cells, part, of, the, innate, immune, system, display, opiate, receptors, dendritic, cells, are, responsible, for, producing, cytokines, which, are, the, tools, for, communication, in, the, immune, system, this, same, study, showed, that, dendritic, cells, chronically, treated, with, morphine, during, their, differentiation, produce, more, interleukin, 12, il, 12, a, cytokine, responsible, for, promoting, the, proliferation, growth, and, differentiation, of, t, cells, another, cell, of, the, adaptive, immune, system, and, less, interleukin, 10, il, 10, a, cytokine, responsible, for, promoting, a, b, cell, immune, response, b, cells, produce, antibodies, to, fight, off, infection, this, regulation, of, cytokines, appear, to, occur, via, the, p38, mapks, mitogen, activated, protein, kinase, dependent, pathway, usually, the, p38, within, the, dendritic, cell, expresses, tlr, 4, toll, like, receptor, 4, which, is, activated, through, the, ligand, lps, lipopolysaccharide, this, causes, the, p38, mapk, to, be, phosphorylated, this, phosphorylation, activates, the, p38, mapk, to, begin, producing, il, 10, and, il, 12, when, the, dendritic, cells, are, chronically, exposed, to, morphine, during, their, differentiation, process, then, treated, with, lps, the, production, of, cytokines, is, different, once, treated, with, morphine, the, p38, mapk, does, not, produce, il, 10, instead, favoring, production, of, il, 12, the, exact, mechanism, through, which, the, production, of, one, cytokine, is, increased, in, favor, over, another, is, not, known, most, likely, the, morphine, causes, increased, phosphorylation, of, the, p38, mapk, transcriptional, level, interactions, between, il, 10, and, il, 12, may, further, increase, the, production, of, il, 12, once, il, 10, is, not, being, produced, this, increased, production, of, il, 12, causes, increased, t, cell, immune, response, further, studies, on, the, effects, of, morphine, on, the, immune, system, have, shown, that, morphine, influences, the, production, of, neutrophils, and, other, cytokines, since, cytokines, are, produced, as, part, of, the, immediate, immunological, response, inflammation, it, has, been, suggested, that, they, may, also, influence, pain, in, this, way, cytokines, may, be, a, logical, target, for, analgesic, development, recently, one, study, has, used, an, animal, model, hind, paw, incision, to, observe, the, effects, of, morphine, administration, on, the, acute, immunological, response, following, hind, paw, incision, pain, thresholds, and, cytokine, production, were, measured, normally, cytokine, production, in, and, around, the, wounded, area, increases, in, order, to, fight, infection, and, control, healing, and, possibly, to, control, pain, but, pre, incisional, morphine, administration, 0, 1, mg, kg, to, 10, 0, mg, kg, reduced, the, number, of, cytokines, found, around, the, wound, in, a, dose, dependent, manner, the, authors, suggest, that, morphine, administration, in, the, acute, post, injury, period, may, reduce, resistance, to, infection, and, may, impair, the, healing, of, the, wound, morphine, can, be, taken, orally, sublingually, bucally, rectally, subcutaneously, intranasally, intravenously, intrathecally, or, epidurally, and, inhaled, via, a, nebulizer, as, a, recreational, drug, it, is, becoming, more, common, to, inhale, chasing, the, dragon, but, for, medical, purposes, intravenous, iv, injection, is, the, most, common, method, of, administration, morphine, is, subject, to, extensive, first, pass, metabolism, a, large, proportion, is, broken, down, in, the, liver, so, if, taken, orally, only, 40, to, 50, of, the, dose, reaches, the, central, nervous, system, resultant, plasma, levels, after, subcutaneous, sc, intramuscular, im, and, iv, injection, are, all, comparable, after, im, or, sc, injections, morphine, plasma, levels, peak, in, approximately, 20, min, and, after, oral, administration, levels, peak, in, approximately, 30, min, morphine, is, metabolised, primarily, in, the, liver, and, approximately, 87, of, a, dose, of, morphine, is, excreted, in, the, urine, within, 72, h, of, administration, morphine, is, metabolized, primarily, into, morphine, 3, glucuronide, m3g, and, morphine, 6, glucuronide, m6g, via, glucuronidation, by, phase, ii, metabolism, enzyme, udp, glucuronosyl, transferase, 2b7, ugt2b7, about, 60, of, morphine, is, converted, to, m3g, and, 6, to, 10, is, converted, to, m6g, not, only, does, the, metabolism, occur, in, the, liver, but, it, may, also, take, place, in, the, brain, and, the, kidneys, m3g, does, not, undergo, opioid, receptor, binding, and, has, no, analgesic, effect, m6g, binds, to, receptors, and, is, half, as, potent, an, analgesic, as, morphine, in, humans, morphine, may, also, be, metabolized, into, small, amounts, of, normorphine, codeine, and, hydromorphone, metabolism, rate, is, determined, by, gender, age, diet, genetic, makeup, disease, state, if, any, and, use, of, other, medications, the, elimination, half, life, of, morphine, is, approximately, 120, min, though, there, may, be, slight, differences, between, men, and, women, morphine, can, be, stored, in, fat, and, thus, can, be, detectable, even, after, death, morphine, can, cross, the, blood, brain, barrier, but, because, of, poor, lipid, solubility, protein, binding, rapid, conjugation, with, glucuronic, acid, and, ionization, it, does, not, cross, easily, heroin, which, is, derived, from, morphine, crosses, the, blood, brain, barrier, more, easily, making, it, more, potent, there, are, extended, release, formulations, of, orally, administered, morphine, whose, effect, last, longer, which, can, be, given, once, per, day, brand, names, for, this, formulation, of, morphine, include, avinza, kadian, ms, contin, and, dolcontin, for, constant, pain, the, relieving, effect, of, extended, release, morphine, given, once, for, kadian, or, twice, for, ms, contin, every, 24, hours, is, roughly, the, same, as, multiple, administrations, of, immediate, release, or, regular, morphine, extended, release, morphine, can, be, administered, together, with, rescue, doses, of, immediate, release, morphine, as, needed, in, case, of, breakthrough, pain, each, generally, consisting, of, 5, to, 15, of, the, 24, hour, extended, release, dosage, morphine, and, its, major, metabolites, morphine, 3, glucuronide, and, morphine, 6, glucuronide, can, be, detected, in, blood, plasma, hair, and, urine, using, an, immunoassay, chromatography, can, be, used, to, test, for, each, of, these, substances, individually, some, testing, procedures, hydrolyze, metabolic, products, into, morphine, before, the, immunoassay, which, must, be, considered, when, comparing, morphine, levels, in, separately, published, results, morphine, can, also, be, isolated, from, whole, blood, samples, by, solid, phase, extraction, spe, and, detected, using, liquid, chromatography, mass, spectrometry, lc, ms, ingestion, of, codeine, or, food, containing, poppy, seeds, can, cause, false, positives, a, 1999, review, estimated, that, relatively, low, doses, of, heroin, which, metabolizes, immediately, into, morphine, are, detectable, by, standard, urine, tests, for, 1, 1, 5, days, after, use, a, 2009, review, determined, that, when, the, analyte, is, morphine, and, the, limit, of, detection, is, 1, ng, ml, a, 20, mg, intravenous, iv, dose, of, morphine, is, detectable, for, 12, 24, hours, a, limit, of, detection, of, 0, 6, ng, ml, had, similar, results, morphine, is, a, pentacyclic, 3, amine, alkaloid, with, 5, stereogenic, centers, and, exists, in, 32, stereoisomeric, forms, but, the, desired, analgesic, activity, resides, exclusively, in, the, natural, product, the, enantiomer, with, the, configuration, 5r, 6s, 9r, 13s, 14r, morphine, is, the, most, abundant, opiate, found, in, opium, the, dried, latex, extracted, by, shallowly, scoring, the, unripe, seedpods, of, the, papaver, somniferum, poppy, morphine, is, generally, 8, 14, of, the, dry, weight, of, opium, przemko, and, norman, cultivars, of, the, opium, poppy, are, used, to, produce, two, other, alkaloids, thebaine, and, oripavine, which, are, used, in, the, manufacture, of, semi, synthetic, and, synthetic, opioids, like, oxycodone, and, etorphine, p, bracteatum, does, not, contain, morphine, or, codeine, or, other, narcotic, phenanthrene, type, alkaloids, this, species, is, rather, a, source, of, thebaine, occurrence, of, morphine, in, other, papaverales, and, papaveraceae, as, well, as, in, some, species, of, hops, and, mulberry, trees, has, not, been, confirmed, morphine, is, produced, most, predominantly, early, in, the, life, cycle, of, the, plant, past, the, optimum, point, for, extraction, various, processes, in, the, plant, produce, codeine, thebaine, and, in, some, cases, negligible, amounts, of, hydromorphone, dihydromorphine, dihydrocodeine, tetrahydro, thebaine, and, hydrocodone, these, compounds, are, rather, synthesized, from, thebaine, and, oripavine, in, the, brain, of, mammals, morphine, is, detectable, in, trace, steady, state, concentrations, the, human, body, also, produces, endorphins, which, are, chemically, related, endogenous, opioid, peptides, that, function, as, neuropeptides, and, have, similar, effects, to, morphine, morphine, is, an, endogenous, opioid, in, humans, various, human, cells, are, capable, of, synthesizing, and, releasing, it, including, white, blood, cells, the, primary, biosynthetic, pathway, for, morphine, in, humans, consists, of, the, intermediate, s, norlaudanosoline, also, known, as, tetrahydropapaveroline, is, synthesized, through, addition, of, dopal, and, dopamine, cyp2d6, a, cytochrome, p450, isoenzyme, is, involved, in, two, steps, along, the, biosynthetic, pathway, catalyzing, both, the, biosynthesis, of, dopamine, from, tyramine, and, of, morphine, from, codeine, urinary, concentrations, of, endogenous, codeine, and, morphine, have, been, found, to, significantly, increase, in, individuals, taking, l, dopa, for, the, treatment, of, parkinson, s, disease, biosynthesis, of, morphine, in, the, opium, poppy, begins, with, two, tyrosine, derivatives, dopamine, and, 4, hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde, condensation, of, these, precursors, yields, the, primary, intermediate, higenamine, norcoclaurine, subsequent, action, of, four, enzymes, yields, the, tetrahydroisoquinoline, reticuline, which, is, converted, into, salutaridine, thebaine, and, oripavine, the, enzymes, involved, in, this, process, are, the, salutaridine, synthase, salutaridine, nadph, 7, oxidoreductase, and, the, codeinone, reductase, researchers, are, attempting, to, reproduce, the, biosynthetic, pathway, that, produces, morphine, in, genetically, engineered, yeast, in, june, 2015, the, s, reticuline, could, be, produced, from, sugar, and, r, reticuline, could, be, converted, to, morphine, but, the, intermediate, reaction, could, not, be, performed, in, august, 2015, the, first, complete, synthesis, of, thebaine, and, hydrocodone, in, yeast, was, reported, but, the, process, would, need, to, be, 100, 000, times, more, productive, to, be, suitable, for, commercial, use, elements, of, the, morphine, structure, have, been, used, to, create, completely, synthetic, drugs, such, as, the, morphinan, family, levorphanol, dextromethorphan, and, others, and, other, groups, that, have, many, members, with, morphine, like, qualities, the, modification, of, morphine, and, the, aforementioned, synthetics, has, also, given, rise, to, non, narcotic, drugs, with, other, uses, such, as, emetics, stimulants, antitussives, anticholinergics, muscle, relaxants, local, anaesthetics, general, anaesthetics, and, others, morphine, derived, agonist, antagonist, drugs, have, also, been, developed, morphine, is, a, benzylisoquinoline, alkaloid, with, two, additional, ring, closures, as, jack, deruiter, of, the, department, of, drug, discovery, and, development, formerly, pharmacal, sciences, harrison, school, of, pharmacy, auburn, university, stated, in, his, fall, 2000, course, notes, for, that, earlier, department, s, principles, of, drug, action, 2, course, examination, of, the, morphine, molecule, reveals, the, following, structural, features, important, to, its, pharmacological, profile, morphine, and, most, of, its, derivatives, do, not, exhibit, optical, isomerism, although, some, more, distant, relatives, like, the, morphinan, series, levorphanol, dextrorphan, and, the, racemic, parent, chemical, racemorphan, do, and, as, noted, above, stereoselectivity, in, vivo, is, an, important, issue, most, of, the, licit, morphine, produced, is, used, to, make, codeine, by, methylation, it, is, also, a, precursor, for, many, drugs, including, heroin, 3, 6, diacetylmorphine, hydromorphone, dihydromorphinone, and, oxymorphone, 14, hydroxydihydromorphinone, most, semi, synthetic, opioids, both, of, the, morphine, and, codeine, subgroups, are, created, by, modifying, one, or, more, of, the, following, many, morphine, derivatives, can, also, be, manufactured, using, thebaine, or, codeine, as, a, starting, material, replacement, of, the, n, methyl, group, of, morphine, with, an, n, phenylethyl, group, results, in, a, product, that, is, 18, times, more, powerful, than, morphine, in, its, opiate, agonist, potency, combining, this, modification, with, the, replacement, of, the, 6, hydroxyl, with, a, 6, methylene, group, produces, a, compound, some, 1, 443, times, more, potent, than, morphine, stronger, than, the, bentley, compounds, such, as, etorphine, m99, the, immobilon, tranquilliser, dart, by, some, measures, closely, related, to, morphine, are, the, opioids, morphine, n, oxide, genomorphine, which, is, a, pharmaceutical, that, is, no, longer, in, common, use, and, pseudomorphine, an, alkaloid, that, exists, in, opium, form, as, degradation, products, of, morphine, as, a, result, of, the, extensive, study, and, use, of, this, molecule, more, than, 250, morphine, derivatives, also, counting, codeine, and, related, drugs, have, been, developed, since, the, last, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, these, drugs, range, from, 25, the, analgesic, strength, of, codeine, or, slightly, more, than, 2, of, the, strength, of, morphine, to, several, thousand, times, the, strength, of, morphine, to, powerful, opioid, antagonists, including, naloxone, narcan, naltrexone, trexan, diprenorphine, m5050, the, reversing, agent, for, the, immobilon, dart, and, nalorphine, nalline, some, opioid, agonist, antagonists, partial, agonists, and, inverse, agonists, are, also, derived, from, morphine, the, receptor, activation, profile, of, the, semi, synthetic, morphine, derivatives, varies, widely, and, some, like, apomorphine, are, devoid, of, narcotic, effects, both, morphine, and, its, hydrated, form, are, sparingly, soluble, in, water, for, this, reason, pharmaceutical, companies, produce, sulfate, and, hydrochloride, salts, of, the, drug, both, of, which, are, over, 300, times, more, water, soluble, than, their, parent, molecule, whereas, the, ph, of, a, saturated, morphine, hydrate, solution, is, 8, 5, the, salts, are, acidic, since, they, derive, from, a, strong, acid, but, weak, base, they, are, both, at, about, ph, 5, as, a, consequence, the, morphine, salts, are, mixed, with, small, amounts, of, naoh, to, make, them, suitable, for, injection, a, number, of, salts, of, morphine, are, used, with, the, most, common, in, current, clinical, use, being, the, hydrochloride, sulfate, tartrate, and, citrate, less, commonly, methobromide, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, chloride, and, bitartrate, and, the, others, listed, below, morphine, diacetate, heroin, is, not, a, salt, but, rather, a, further, derivative, see, above, morphine, meconate, is, a, major, form, of, the, alkaloid, in, the, poppy, as, is, morphine, pectinate, nitrate, sulfate, and, some, others, like, codeine, dihydrocodeine, and, other, especially, older, opiates, morphine, has, been, used, as, the, salicylate, salt, by, some, suppliers, and, can, be, easily, compounded, imparting, the, therapeutic, advantage, of, both, the, opioid, and, the, nsaid, multiple, barbiturate, salts, of, morphine, were, also, used, in, the, past, as, was, is, morphine, valerate, the, salt, of, the, acid, being, the, active, principle, of, valerian, calcium, morphenate, is, the, intermediate, in, various, latex, and, poppy, straw, methods, of, morphine, production, more, rarely, sodium, morphenate, takes, its, place, morphine, ascorbate, and, other, salts, such, as, the, tannate, citrate, and, acetate, phosphate, valerate, and, others, may, be, present, in, poppy, tea, depending, on, the, method, of, preparation, the, salts, listed, by, the, united, states, drug, enforcement, administration, for, reporting, purposes, in, addition, to, a, few, others, are, as, follows, in, the, opium, poppy, the, alkaloids, are, bound, to, meconic, acid, the, method, is, to, extract, from, the, crushed, plant, with, diluted, sulfuric, acid, which, is, a, stronger, acid, than, meconic, acid, but, not, so, strong, to, react, with, alkaloid, molecules, the, extraction, is, performed, in, many, steps, one, amount, of, crushed, plant, is, extracted, at, least, six, to, ten, times, so, practically, every, alkaloid, goes, into, the, solution, from, the, solution, obtained, at, the, last, extraction, step, the, alkaloids, are, precipitated, by, either, ammonium, hydroxide, or, sodium, carbonate, the, last, step, is, purifying, and, separating, morphine, from, other, opium, alkaloids, the, somewhat, similar, gregory, process, was, developed, in, the, united, kingdom, during, the, second, world, war, which, begins, with, stewing, the, entire, plant, in, most, cases, save, the, roots, and, leaves, in, plain, or, mildly, acidified, water, then, proceeding, through, steps, of, concentration, extraction, and, purification, of, alkaloids, other, methods, of, processing, poppy, straw, i, e, dried, pods, and, stalks, use, steam, one, or, more, of, several, types, of, alcohol, or, other, organic, solvents, the, poppy, straw, methods, predominate, in, continental, europe, and, the, british, commonwealth, with, the, latex, method, in, most, common, use, in, india, the, latex, method, can, involve, either, vertical, or, horizontal, slicing, of, the, unripe, pods, with, a, two, to, five, bladed, knife, with, a, guard, developed, specifically, for, this, purpose, to, the, depth, of, a, fraction, of, a, millimetre, and, scoring, of, the, pods, can, be, done, up, to, five, times, an, alternative, latex, method, sometimes, used, in, china, in, the, past, is, to, cut, off, the, poppy, heads, run, a, large, needle, through, them, and, collect, the, dried, latex, 24, to, 48, hours, later, in, india, opium, harvested, by, licensed, poppy, farmers, is, dehydrated, to, uniform, levels, of, hydration, at, government, processing, centers, and, then, sold, to, pharmaceutical, companies, that, extract, morphine, from, the, opium, however, in, turkey, and, tasmania, morphine, is, obtained, by, harvesting, and, processing, the, fully, mature, dry, seed, pods, with, attached, stalks, called, poppy, straw, in, turkey, a, water, extraction, process, is, used, while, in, tasmania, a, solvent, extraction, process, is, used, opium, poppy, contains, at, least, 50, different, alkaloids, but, most, of, them, are, of, very, low, concentration, morphine, is, the, principal, alkaloid, in, raw, opium, and, constitutes, roughly, 8, 19, of, opium, by, dry, weight, depending, on, growing, conditions, some, purpose, developed, strains, of, poppy, now, produce, opium, that, is, up, to, 26, morphine, by, weight, a, rough, rule, of, thumb, to, determine, the, morphine, content, of, pulverised, dried, poppy, straw, is, to, divide, the, percentage, expected, for, the, strain, or, crop, via, the, latex, method, by, eight, or, an, empirically, determined, factor, which, is, often, in, the, range, of, 5, to, 15, the, norman, strain, of, p, somniferum, also, developed, in, tasmania, produces, down, to, 0, 04, morphine, but, with, much, higher, amounts, of, thebaine, and, oripavine, which, can, be, used, to, synthesise, semi, synthetic, opioids, as, well, as, other, drugs, like, stimulants, emetics, opioid, antagonists, anticholinergics, and, smooth, muscle, agents, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, hungary, supplied, nearly, 60, of, europe, s, total, medication, purpose, morphine, production, to, this, day, poppy, farming, is, legal, in, hungary, but, poppy, farms, are, limited, by, law, to, 2, acres, 8, 100, m, 2, it, is, also, legal, to, sell, dried, poppy, in, flower, shops, for, use, in, floral, arrangements, it, was, announced, in, 1973, that, a, team, at, the, national, institutes, of, health, in, the, united, states, had, developed, a, method, for, total, synthesis, of, morphine, codeine, and, thebaine, using, coal, tar, as, a, starting, material, a, shortage, in, codeine, hydrocodone, class, cough, suppressants, all, of, which, can, be, made, from, morphine, in, one, or, more, steps, as, well, as, from, codeine, or, thebaine, was, the, initial, reason, for, the, research, most, morphine, produced, for, pharmaceutical, use, around, the, world, is, actually, converted, into, codeine, as, the, concentration, of, the, latter, in, both, raw, opium, and, poppy, straw, is, much, lower, than, that, of, morphine, in, most, countries, the, usage, of, codeine, both, as, end, product, and, precursor, is, at, least, equal, or, greater, than, that, of, morphine, on, a, weight, basis, the, first, morphine, total, synthesis, devised, by, marshall, d, gates, jr, in, 1952, remains, a, widely, used, example, of, total, synthesis, several, other, syntheses, were, reported, notably, by, the, research, groups, of, rice, evans, fuchs, parker, overman, mulzer, trauner, white, taber, trost, fukuyama, guillou, and, stork, because, of, the, stereochemical, complexity, and, consequent, synthetic, challenge, presented, by, this, polycyclic, structure, michael, freemantle, has, expressed, the, view, that, it, is, highly, unlikely, that, a, chemical, synthesis, will, ever, be, cost, effective, such, that, it, could, compete, with, the, cost, of, producing, morphine, from, the, opium, poppy, thebaine, has, been, produced, by, gmo, e, coli, morphine, is, a, precursor, in, the, manufacture, in, a, number, of, opioids, such, as, dihydromorphine, hydromorphone, hydrocodone, and, oxycodone, as, well, as, codeine, which, itself, has, a, large, family, of, semi, synthetic, derivatives, illicit, morphine, is, produced, though, rarely, from, codeine, found, in, over, the, counter, cough, and, pain, medicines, another, illicit, source, is, morphine, extracted, from, extended, release, morphine, products, chemical, reactions, can, then, be, used, to, convert, morphine, dihydromorphine, and, hydrocodone, into, heroin, or, other, opioids, other, clandestine, conversions, of, morphine, into, ketones, of, the, hydromorphone, class, or, other, derivatives, like, dihydromorphine, paramorfan, desomorphine, permonid, metopon, etc, and, of, codeine, into, hydrocodone, dicodid, dihydrocodeine, paracodin, etc, require, greater, expertise, and, types, and, quantities, of, chemicals, and, equipment, that, are, more, difficult, to, source, and, so, are, more, rarely, used, illicitly, but, cases, have, been, recorded, the, earliest, known, reference, to, morphine, can, be, traced, back, to, theophrastus, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, however, possible, references, to, morphine, may, go, as, far, back, as, 2100, bc, as, sumerian, clay, tablets, which, records, lists, of, medical, prescriptions, include, opium, based, cures, an, opium, based, elixir, has, been, ascribed, to, alchemists, of, byzantine, times, but, the, specific, formula, was, lost, during, the, ottoman, conquest, of, constantinople, istanbul, around, 1522, paracelsus, made, reference, to, an, opium, based, elixir, that, he, called, laudanum, from, the, latin, word, laud, re, meaning, to, praise, he, described, it, as, a, potent, painkiller, but, recommended, that, it, be, used, sparingly, the, recipe, given, differs, substantially, from, that, of, modern, day, laudanum, morphine, was, discovered, as, the, first, active, alkaloid, extracted, from, the, opium, poppy, plant, in, december, 1804, in, paderborn, by, german, pharmacist, friedrich, sert, rner, in, 1817, sert, rner, reported, experiments, in, which, he, administered, morphine, to, himself, three, young, boys, three, dogs, and, a, mouse, all, four, people, almost, died, sert, rner, originally, named, the, substance, morphium, after, the, greek, god, of, dreams, morpheus, as, it, has, a, tendency, to, cause, sleep, sert, rner, s, morphium, was, six, times, stronger, than, opium, he, hypothesized, that, because, lower, doses, of, the, drug, were, needed, it, would, be, less, addictive, however, sert, rner, became, addicted, to, the, drug, warning, that, i, consider, it, my, duty, to, attract, attention, to, the, terrible, effects, of, this, new, substance, i, called, morphium, in, order, that, calamity, may, be, averted, the, drug, was, first, marketed, to, the, general, public, by, sert, rner, and, company, in, 1817, as, a, pain, medication, and, also, as, a, treatment, for, opium, and, alcohol, addiction, it, was, first, used, as, a, poison, in, 1822, when, edme, castaing, of, france, was, convicted, of, murdering, a, patient, commercial, production, began, in, darmstadt, germany, in, 1827, by, the, pharmacy, that, became, the, pharmaceutical, company, merck, with, morphine, sales, being, a, large, part, of, their, early, growth, in, the, 1850s, alexander, wood, reported, that, he, had, injected, morphine, into, his, wife, rebecca, as, an, experiment, the, myth, goes, that, this, killed, her, because, of, respiratory, depression, but, she, outlived, her, husband, by, ten, years, later, it, was, found, that, morphine, was, more, addictive, than, either, alcohol, or, opium, and, its, extensive, use, during, the, american, civil, war, allegedly, resulted, in, over, 400, 000, people, with, the, soldier, s, disease, of, morphine, addiction, this, idea, has, been, a, subject, of, controversy, as, there, have, been, suggestions, that, such, a, disease, was, in, fact, a, fabrication, the, first, documented, use, of, the, phrase, soldier, s, disease, was, in, 1915, diacetylmorphine, better, known, as, heroin, was, synthesized, from, morphine, in, 1874, and, brought, to, market, by, bayer, in, 1898, heroin, is, approximately, 1, 5, to, 2, times, more, potent, than, morphine, weight, for, weight, due, to, the, lipid, solubility, of, diacetylmorphine, it, can, cross, the, blood, brain, barrier, faster, than, morphine, subsequently, increasing, the, reinforcing, component, of, addiction, using, a, variety, of, subjective, and, objective, measures, one, study, estimated, the, relative, potency, of, heroin, to, morphine, administered, intravenously, to, post, addicts, to, be, 1, 80, 2, 66, mg, of, morphine, sulfate, to, 1, mg, of, diamorphine, hydrochloride, heroin, morphine, became, a, controlled, substance, in, the, us, under, the, harrison, narcotics, tax, act, of, 1914, and, possession, without, a, prescription, in, the, us, is, a, criminal, offense, morphine, was, the, most, commonly, abused, narcotic, analgesic, in, the, world, until, heroin, was, synthesized, and, came, into, use, in, general, until, the, synthesis, of, dihydromorphine, c, 1900, the, dihydromorphinone, class, of, opioids, 1920s, and, oxycodone, 1916, and, similar, drugs, there, were, no, other, drugs, in, the, same, efficacy, range, as, opium, morphine, and, heroin, with, synthetics, still, several, years, away, pethidine, was, invented, in, germany, in, 1937, and, opioid, agonists, among, the, semi, synthetics, were, analogues, and, derivatives, of, codeine, such, as, dihydrocodeine, paracodin, ethylmorphine, dionine, and, benzylmorphine, peronine, even, today, morphine, is, the, most, sought, after, prescription, narcotic, by, heroin, addicts, when, heroin, is, scarce, all, other, things, being, equal, local, conditions, and, user, preference, may, cause, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, high, dose, oxycodone, or, methadone, as, well, as, dextromoramide, in, specific, instances, such, as, 1970s, australia, to, top, that, particular, list, the, stop, gap, drugs, used, by, the, largest, absolute, number, of, heroin, addicts, is, probably, codeine, with, significant, use, also, of, dihydrocodeine, poppy, straw, derivatives, like, poppy, pod, and, poppy, seed, tea, propoxyphene, and, tramadol, the, structural, formula, of, morphine, was, determined, by, 1925, by, robert, robinson, at, least, three, methods, of, total, synthesis, of, morphine, from, starting, materials, such, as, coal, tar, and, petroleum, distillates, have, been, patented, the, first, of, which, was, announced, in, 1952, by, marshall, d, gates, jr, at, the, university, of, rochester, still, the, vast, majority, of, morphine, is, derived, from, the, opium, poppy, by, either, the, traditional, method, of, gathering, latex, from, the, scored, unripe, pods, of, the, poppy, or, processes, using, poppy, straw, the, dried, pods, and, stems, of, the, plant, the, most, widespread, of, which, was, invented, in, hungary, in, 1925, and, announced, in, 1930, by, hungarian, pharmacologist, j, nos, kabay, in, 2003, there, was, discovery, of, endogenous, morphine, occurring, naturally, in, the, human, body, thirty, years, of, speculation, were, made, on, this, subject, because, there, was, a, receptor, that, it, appeared, reacted, only, to, morphine, the, 3, opioid, receptor, in, human, tissue, human, cells, that, form, in, reaction, to, cancerous, neuroblastoma, cells, have, been, found, to, contain, trace, amounts, of, endogenous, morphine, the, euphoria, comprehensive, alleviation, of, distress, and, therefore, all, aspects, of, suffering, promotion, of, sociability, and, empathy, body, high, and, anxiolysis, provided, by, narcotic, drugs, including, the, opioids, can, cause, the, use, of, high, doses, in, the, absence, of, pain, for, a, protracted, period, which, can, impart, a, craving, for, the, drug, in, the, user, as, the, prototype, of, the, entire, opioid, class, of, drugs, morphine, has, properties, that, may, lead, to, its, misuse, morphine, addiction, is, the, model, upon, which, the, current, perception, of, addiction, is, based, animal, and, human, studies, and, clinical, experience, back, up, the, contention, that, morphine, is, one, of, the, most, euphoric, drugs, known, and, via, all, but, the, iv, route, heroin, and, morphine, cannot, be, distinguished, according, to, studies, because, heroin, is, a, prodrug, for, the, delivery, of, systemic, morphine, chemical, changes, to, the, morphine, molecule, yield, other, euphorigenics, such, as, dihydromorphine, hydromorphone, dilaudid, hydal, and, oxymorphone, numorphan, opana, as, well, as, the, latter, three, s, methylated, equivalents, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, and, oxycodone, respectively, in, addition, to, heroin, there, are, dipropanoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine, and, other, members, of, the, 3, 6, morphine, diester, category, like, nicomorphine, and, other, similar, semi, synthetic, opiates, like, desomorphine, hydromorphinol, etc, used, clinically, in, many, countries, of, the, world, but, also, produced, illicitly, in, rare, instances, in,
