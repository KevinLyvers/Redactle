substance, dependence, also, known, as, drug, dependence, is, a, biopsychological, situation, whereby, an, individual, s, functionality, is, dependent, on, the, necessitated, re, consumption, of, a, psychoactive, substance, because, of, an, adaptive, state, that, has, developed, within, the, individual, from, psychoactive, substance, consumption, that, results, in, the, experience, of, withdrawal, and, that, necessitates, the, re, consumption, of, the, drug, a, drug, addiction, a, distinct, concept, from, substance, dependence, is, defined, as, compulsive, out, of, control, drug, use, despite, negative, consequences, an, addictive, drug, is, a, drug, which, is, both, rewarding, and, reinforcing, fosb, a, gene, transcription, factor, is, now, known, to, be, a, critical, component, and, common, factor, in, the, development, of, virtually, all, forms, of, behavioral, and, drug, addictions, but, not, dependence, the, international, classification, of, diseases, classifies, substance, dependence, as, a, mental, and, behavioural, disorder, within, the, framework, of, the, 4th, edition, of, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, iv, substance, dependence, is, redefined, as, a, drug, addiction, and, can, be, diagnosed, without, the, occurrence, of, a, withdrawal, syndrome, it, was, described, accordingly, when, an, individual, persists, in, use, of, alcohol, or, other, drugs, despite, problems, related, to, use, of, the, substance, substance, dependence, may, be, diagnosed, compulsive, and, repetitive, use, may, result, in, tolerance, to, the, effect, of, the, drug, and, withdrawal, symptoms, when, use, is, reduced, or, stopped, this, along, with, substance, abuse, are, considered, substance, use, disorders, in, the, dsm, 5, released, in, 2013, substance, abuse, and, substance, dependence, were, eliminated, and, replaced, with, the, category, of, substance, use, disorders, this, was, done, because, the, tolerance, and, withdrawal, that, previously, defined, dependence, are, actually, very, normal, responses, to, prescribed, medications, that, affect, the, central, nervous, system, and, do, not, necessarily, indicate, the, presence, of, an, addiction, withdrawal, is, the, body, s, reaction, to, abstaining, from, a, substance, upon, which, a, person, has, developed, a, dependence, syndrome, when, dependence, has, developed, cessation, of, substance, use, produces, an, unpleasant, state, which, promotes, continued, drug, use, through, negative, reinforcement, i, e, the, drug, is, used, to, escape, or, avoid, re, entering, the, associated, withdrawal, state, the, withdrawal, state, may, include, physical, somatic, symptoms, physical, dependence, emotional, motivational, symptoms, psychological, dependence, or, both, chemical, and, hormonal, imbalances, may, arise, if, the, substance, is, not, re, introduced, psychological, stress, may, also, result, if, the, substance, is, not, re, introduced, infants, also, experience, substance, withdrawal, known, as, neonatal, abstinence, syndrome, nas, which, can, have, severe, and, life, threatening, effects, addiction, to, drugs, such, as, alcohol, in, expectant, mothers, not, only, causes, nas, but, also, an, array, of, other, issues, which, can, continually, affect, the, infant, throughout, their, lifetime, the, dependence, potential, or, dependence, liability, of, a, drug, varies, from, substance, to, substance, and, from, individual, to, individual, dose, frequency, pharmacokinetics, of, a, particular, substance, route, of, administration, and, time, are, critical, factors, for, developing, a, drug, dependence, an, article, in, the, lancet, compared, the, harm, and, dependence, liability, of, 20, drugs, using, a, scale, from, zero, to, three, for, physical, dependence, psychological, dependence, and, pleasure, to, create, a, mean, score, for, dependence, selected, results, can, be, seen, in, the, chart, below, capture, rates, enumerate, the, percentage, of, users, who, reported, that, they, had, become, dependent, to, their, respective, drug, at, some, point, two, factors, have, been, identified, as, playing, pivotal, roles, in, psychological, dependence, the, neuropeptide, corticotropin, releasing, factor, crf, and, the, gene, transcription, factor, camp, response, element, binding, protein, creb, the, nucleus, accumbens, nacc, is, one, brain, structure, that, has, been, implicated, in, the, psychological, component, of, drug, dependence, in, the, nacc, creb, is, activated, by, cyclic, adenosine, monophosphate, camp, immediately, after, a, high, and, triggers, changes, in, gene, expression, that, affect, proteins, such, as, dynorphin, dynorphin, peptides, reduce, dopamine, release, into, the, nacc, by, temporarily, inhibiting, the, reward, pathway, a, sustained, activation, of, creb, thus, forces, a, larger, dose, to, be, taken, to, reach, the, same, effect, in, addition, it, leaves, the, user, feeling, generally, depressed, and, dissatisfied, and, unable, to, find, pleasure, in, previously, enjoyable, activities, often, leading, to, a, return, to, the, drug, for, another, dose, in, addition, to, creb, it, is, hypothesized, that, stress, mechanisms, play, a, role, in, dependence, koob, and, kreek, have, hypothesized, that, during, drug, use, crf, activates, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, hpa, axis, and, other, stress, systems, in, the, extended, amygdala, this, activation, influences, the, dysregulated, emotional, state, associated, with, psychological, dependence, they, found, that, as, drug, use, escalates, so, does, the, presence, of, crf, in, human, cerebrospinal, fluid, in, rat, models, the, separate, use, of, crf, inhibitors, and, crf, receptor, antagonists, both, decreased, self, administration, of, the, drug, of, study, other, studies, in, this, review, showed, dysregulation, of, other, neuropeptides, that, affect, the, hpa, axis, including, enkephalin, which, is, an, endogenous, opioid, peptide, that, regulates, pain, it, also, appears, that, opioid, receptors, which, enkephalin, acts, upon, is, influential, in, the, reward, system, and, can, regulate, the, expression, of, stress, hormones, increased, expression, of, ampa, receptors, in, nucleus, accumbens, msns, is, a, potential, mechanism, of, aversion, produced, by, drug, withdrawal, upregulation, of, the, camp, signal, transduction, pathway, in, the, locus, coeruleus, by, creb, has, been, implicated, as, the, mechanism, responsible, for, certain, aspects, of, opioid, induced, physical, dependence, the, temporal, course, of, withdrawal, correlates, with, lc, firing, and, administration, of, 2, agonists, into, the, locus, coeruleus, leads, to, a, decrease, in, lc, firing, and, norepinephrine, release, during, withdrawal, a, possible, mechanism, involves, upregulation, of, nmda, receptors, which, is, supported, by, the, attenuation, of, withdraw, by, nmda, receptor, antagonists, physical, dependence, on, opioids, has, been, observed, to, produce, an, elevation, of, extracellular, glutamate, an, increase, in, nmda, receptor, subunits, nr1, and, nr2a, phosphorylated, camkii, and, c, fos, expression, of, camkii, and, c, fos, is, attenuated, by, nmda, receptor, antagonists, which, is, associated, with, blunted, withdrawal, in, adult, rats, but, not, neonatal, rats, while, acute, administration, of, opioids, decreases, ampa, receptor, expression, and, depresses, both, nmda, and, non, nmda, excitatory, postsynaptic, potentials, in, the, nac, withdrawal, involves, a, lowered, threshold, for, ltp, and, an, increase, in, spontaneous, firing, in, the, nac, substance, dependence, as, defined, in, the, dsm, iv, can, be, diagnosed, with, physiological, dependence, evidence, of, tolerance, or, withdrawal, or, without, physiological, dependence, dsm, iv, substance, dependencies, include, addiction, is, a, complex, but, treatable, condition, it, is, characterized, by, compulsive, drug, craving, seeking, and, use, that, persists, even, if, the, user, is, aware, of, severe, adverse, consequences, for, some, people, addiction, becomes, chronic, with, periodic, relapses, even, after, long, periods, of, abstinence, as, a, chronic, relapsing, disease, addiction, may, require, continued, treatments, to, increase, the, intervals, between, relapses, and, diminish, their, intensity, while, some, with, substance, issues, recover, and, lead, fulfilling, lives, others, require, ongoing, additional, support, the, ultimate, goal, of, addiction, treatment, is, to, enable, an, individual, to, manage, their, substance, misuse, for, some, this, may, mean, abstinence, immediate, goals, are, often, to, reduce, substance, abuse, improve, the, patient, s, ability, to, function, and, minimize, the, medical, and, social, complications, of, substance, abuse, and, their, addiction, this, is, called, harm, reduction, treatments, for, addiction, vary, widely, according, to, the, types, of, drugs, involved, amount, of, drugs, used, duration, of, the, drug, addiction, medical, complications, and, the, social, needs, of, the, individual, determining, the, best, type, of, recovery, program, for, an, addicted, person, depends, on, a, number, of, factors, including, personality, drugs, of, choice, concept, of, spirituality, or, religion, mental, or, physical, illness, and, local, availability, and, affordability, of, programs, many, different, ideas, circulate, regarding, what, is, considered, a, successful, outcome, in, the, recovery, from, addiction, programs, that, emphasize, controlled, drinking, exist, for, alcohol, addiction, opiate, replacement, therapy, has, been, a, medical, standard, of, treatment, for, opioid, addiction, for, many, years, treatments, and, attitudes, toward, addiction, vary, widely, among, different, countries, in, the, us, and, developing, countries, the, goal, of, commissioners, of, treatment, for, drug, dependence, is, generally, total, abstinence, from, all, drugs, other, countries, particularly, in, europe, argue, the, aims, of, treatment, for, drug, dependence, are, more, complex, with, treatment, aims, including, reduction, in, use, to, the, point, that, drug, use, no, longer, interferes, with, normal, activities, such, as, work, and, family, commitments, shifting, the, addict, away, from, more, dangerous, routes, of, drug, administration, such, as, injecting, to, safer, routes, such, as, oral, administration, reduction, in, crime, committed, by, drug, addicts, and, treatment, of, other, comorbid, conditions, such, as, aids, hepatitis, and, mental, health, disorders, these, kinds, of, outcomes, can, be, achieved, without, eliminating, drug, use, completely, drug, treatment, programs, in, europe, often, report, more, favorable, outcomes, than, those, in, the, us, because, the, criteria, for, measuring, success, are, functional, rather, than, abstinence, based, the, supporters, of, programs, with, total, abstinence, from, drugs, as, a, goal, believe, that, enabling, further, drug, use, means, prolonged, drug, use, and, risks, an, increase, in, addiction, and, complications, from, addiction, residential, drug, treatment, can, be, broadly, divided, into, two, camps, 12, step, programs, and, therapeutic, communities, 12, step, programs, are, a, nonclinical, support, group, and, spiritual, based, approach, to, treating, addiction, therapy, typically, involves, the, use, of, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, an, approach, that, looks, at, the, relationship, between, thoughts, feelings, and, behaviors, addressing, the, root, cause, of, maladaptive, behavior, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, treats, addiction, as, a, behavior, rather, than, a, disease, and, so, is, subsequently, curable, or, rather, unlearnable, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, programs, recognize, that, for, some, individuals, controlled, use, is, a, more, realistic, possibility, one, of, many, recovery, methods, are, 12, step, recovery, programs, with, prominent, examples, including, alcoholics, anonymous, narcotics, anonymous, and, pills, anonymous, they, are, commonly, known, and, used, for, a, variety, of, addictions, for, the, individual, addicted, and, the, family, of, the, individual, substance, abuse, rehabilitation, rehab, centers, offer, a, residential, treatment, program, for, some, of, the, more, seriously, addicted, in, order, to, isolate, the, patient, from, drugs, and, interactions, with, other, users, and, dealers, outpatient, clinics, usually, offer, a, combination, of, individual, counseling, and, group, counseling, frequently, a, physician, or, psychiatrist, will, prescribe, medications, in, order, to, help, patients, cope, with, the, side, effects, of, their, addiction, medications, can, help, immensely, with, anxiety, and, insomnia, can, treat, underlying, mental, disorders, cf, self, medication, hypothesis, khantzian, 1997, such, as, depression, and, can, help, reduce, or, eliminate, withdrawal, symptomology, when, withdrawing, from, physiologically, addictive, drugs, some, examples, are, using, benzodiazepines, for, alcohol, detoxification, which, prevents, delirium, tremens, and, complications, using, a, slow, taper, of, benzodiazepines, or, a, taper, of, phenobarbital, sometimes, including, another, antiepileptic, agent, such, as, gabapentin, pregabalin, or, valproate, for, withdrawal, from, barbiturates, or, benzodiazepines, using, drugs, such, as, baclofen, to, reduce, cravings, and, propensity, for, relapse, amongst, addicts, to, any, drug, especially, effective, in, stimulant, users, and, alcoholics, in, which, it, is, nearly, as, effective, as, benzodiazepines, in, preventing, complications, using, clonidine, an, alpha, agonist, and, loperamide, for, opioid, detoxification, for, first, time, users, or, those, who, wish, to, attempt, an, abstinence, based, recovery, 90, of, opioid, users, relapse, to, active, addiction, within, eight, months, or, are, multiple, relapse, patients, or, replacing, an, opioid, that, is, interfering, with, or, destructive, to, a, user, s, life, such, as, illicitly, obtained, heroin, dilaudid, or, oxycodone, with, an, opioid, that, can, be, administered, legally, reduces, or, eliminates, drug, cravings, and, does, not, produce, a, high, such, as, methadone, or, buprenorphine, opioid, replacement, therapy, which, is, the, gold, standard, for, treatment, of, opioid, dependence, in, developed, countries, reducing, the, risk, and, cost, to, both, user, and, society, more, effectively, than, any, other, treatment, modality, for, opioid, dependence, and, shows, the, best, short, term, and, long, term, gains, for, the, user, with, the, greatest, longevity, least, risk, of, fatality, greatest, quality, of, life, and, lowest, risk, of, relapse, and, legal, issues, including, arrest, and, incarceration, in, a, survey, of, treatment, providers, from, three, separate, institutions, the, national, association, of, alcoholism, and, drug, abuse, counselors, rational, recovery, systems, and, the, society, of, psychologists, in, addictive, behaviors, measuring, the, treatment, provider, s, responses, on, the, spiritual, belief, scale, a, scale, measuring, belief, in, the, four, spiritual, characteristics, of, aa, identified, by, ernest, kurtz, the, scores, were, found, to, explain, 41, of, the, variance, in, the, treatment, provider, s, responses, on, the, addiction, belief, scale, a, scale, measuring, adherence, to, the, disease, model, or, the, free, will, model, of, addiction, behavioral, programming, is, considered, critical, in, helping, those, with, addictions, achieve, abstinence, from, the, applied, behavior, analysis, literature, and, the, behavioral, psychology, literature, several, evidence, based, intervention, programs, have, emerged, 1, behavioral, marital, therapy, 2, community, reinforcement, approach, 3, cue, exposure, therapy, and, 4, contingency, management, strategies, in, addition, the, same, author, suggests, that, social, skills, training, adjunctive, to, inpatient, treatment, of, alcohol, dependence, is, probably, efficacious, community, reinforcement, has, both, efficacy, and, effectiveness, data, in, addition, behavioral, treatment, such, as, community, reinforcement, and, family, training, craft, have, helped, family, members, to, get, their, loved, ones, into, treatment, motivational, intervention, has, also, shown, to, be, an, effective, treatment, for, substance, dependence, alternative, therapies, such, as, acupuncture, are, used, by, some, practitioners, to, alleviate, the, symptoms, of, drug, addiction, in, 1997, the, american, medical, association, ama, adopted, as, policy, the, following, statement, after, a, report, on, a, number, of, alternative, therapies, including, acupuncture, there, is, little, evidence, to, confirm, the, safety, or, efficacy, of, most, alternative, therapies, much, of, the, information, currently, known, about, these, therapies, makes, it, clear, that, many, have, not, been, shown, to, be, efficacious, well, designed, stringently, controlled, research, should, be, done, to, evaluate, the, efficacy, of, alternative, therapies, in, addition, new, research, surrounding, the, effects, of, psilocybin, on, smokers, revealed, that, 80, of, smokers, quit, for, six, months, following, the, treatment, and, 60, remained, smoking, free, for, 5, years, following, the, treatment, medical, professionals, need, to, apply, many, techniques, and, approaches, to, help, patients, with, substance, related, disorders, using, a, psychodynamic, approach, is, one, of, the, techniques, that, psychologists, use, to, solve, addiction, problems, in, psychodynamic, therapy, psychologists, need, to, understand, the, conflicts, and, the, needs, of, the, addicted, person, and, also, need, to, locate, the, defects, of, their, ego, and, defense, mechanisms, using, this, approach, alone, has, proven, to, be, ineffective, in, solving, addiction, problems, cognitive, and, behavioral, techniques, should, be, integrated, with, psychodynamic, approaches, to, achieve, effective, treatment, for, substance, related, disorders, cognitive, treatment, requires, psychologists, to, think, deeply, about, what, is, happening, in, the, brain, of, an, addicted, person, cognitive, psychologists, should, zoom, in, to, neural, functions, of, the, brain, and, understand, that, drugs, have, been, manipulating, the, dopamine, reward, center, of, the, brain, from, this, particular, state, of, thinking, cognitive, psychologists, need, to, find, ways, to, change, the, thought, process, of, the, addicted, person, there, are, two, routes, typically, applied, to, a, cognitive, approach, to, substance, abuse, tracking, the, thoughts, that, pull, patients, to, addiction, and, tracking, the, thoughts, that, prevent, them, if, so, from, relapsing, behavioral, techniques, have, the, widest, application, in, treating, substance, related, disorders, behavioral, psychologists, can, use, the, techniques, of, aversion, therapy, based, on, the, findings, of, pavlov, s, classical, conditioning, it, uses, the, principle, of, pairing, abused, substances, with, unpleasant, stimuli, or, conditions, for, example, pairing, pain, electrical, shock, or, nausea, with, alcohol, consumption, the, use, of, medications, may, also, be, used, in, this, approach, such, as, using, disulfiram, to, pair, unpleasant, effects, with, the, thought, of, alcohol, use, psychologists, tend, to, use, an, integration, of, all, these, approaches, to, produce, reliable, and, effective, treatment, with, the, advanced, clinical, use, of, medications, biological, treatment, is, now, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, efficient, interventions, that, psychologists, may, use, as, treatment, for, those, with, substance, dependence, another, approach, is, to, use, medicines, that, interfere, with, the, functions, of, the, drugs, in, the, brain, similarly, one, can, also, substitute, the, misused, substance, with, a, weaker, safer, version, to, slowly, taper, the, patient, off, of, their, dependence, such, is, the, case, with, suboxone, in, the, context, of, opioid, dependence, these, approaches, are, aimed, at, the, process, of, detoxification, medical, professionals, weigh, the, consequences, of, withdrawal, symptoms, against, the, risk, of, staying, dependent, on, these, substances, these, withdrawal, symptoms, can, be, very, difficult, and, painful, times, for, patients, most, will, have, steps, in, place, to, handle, severe, withdrawal, symptoms, either, through, behavioral, therapy, or, other, medications, biological, intervention, should, be, combined, with, behavioral, therapy, approaches, and, other, non, pharmacological, techniques, group, therapies, including, anonymity, teamwork, and, sharing, concerns, of, daily, life, among, people, who, also, have, substance, dependence, issues, can, have, a, great, impact, on, outcomes, however, these, programs, proved, to, be, more, effective, and, influential, on, persons, who, did, not, reach, levels, of, serious, dependence, the, phenomenon, of, drug, addiction, has, occurred, to, some, degree, throughout, recorded, history, see, opium, modern, agricultural, practices, improvements, in, access, to, drugs, advancements, in, biochemistry, and, dramatic, increases, in, the, recommendation, of, drug, usage, by, clinical, practitioners, have, exacerbated, the, problem, significantly, in, the, 20th, century, improved, means, of, active, biological, agent, manufacture, and, the, introduction, of, synthetic, compounds, such, as, fentanyl, and, methamphetamine, are, also, factors, contributing, to, drug, addiction, for, the, entirety, of, us, history, drugs, have, been, used, by, some, members, of, the, population, in, the, country, s, early, years, most, drug, use, by, the, settlers, was, of, alcohol, or, tobacco, the, 19th, century, saw, opium, usage, in, the, us, become, much, more, common, and, popular, morphine, was, isolated, in, the, early, 19th, century, and, came, to, be, prescribed, commonly, by, doctors, both, as, a, painkiller, and, as, an, intended, cure, for, opium, addiction, at, the, time, the, prevailing, medical, opinion, was, that, the, addiction, process, occurred, in, the, stomach, and, thus, it, was, hypothesized, that, patients, would, not, become, addicted, to, morphine, if, it, was, injected, into, them, via, a, hypodermic, needle, and, it, was, further, hypothesized, that, this, might, potentially, be, able, to, cure, opium, addiction, however, many, people, did, become, addicted, to, morphine, in, particular, addiction, to, opium, became, widespread, among, soldiers, fighting, in, the, civil, war, who, very, often, required, painkillers, and, thus, were, very, often, prescribed, morphine, women, were, also, very, frequently, prescribed, opiates, and, opiates, were, advertised, as, being, able, to, relieve, female, troubles, many, soldiers, in, the, vietnam, war, were, introduced, to, heroin, and, developed, a, dependency, on, the, substance, which, survived, even, when, they, returned, to, the, us, technological, advances, in, travel, meant, that, this, increased, demand, for, heroin, in, the, us, could, now, be, met, furthermore, as, technology, advanced, more, drugs, were, synthesized, and, discovered, opening, up, new, avenues, to, substance, dependency, internationally, the, u, s, and, eastern, europe, contain, the, countries, with, the, highest, substance, abuse, disorder, occurrence, 5, 6, africa, asia, and, the, middle, east, contain, countries, with, the, lowest, worldwide, occurrence, 1, 2, across, the, globe, those, that, tended, to, have, a, higher, prevalence, of, substance, dependence, were, in, their, twenties, unemployed, and, men, the, national, survey, on, drug, use, and, health, nsduh, reports, on, substance, dependence, abuse, rates, in, various, population, demographics, across, the, u, s, when, surveying, populations, based, on, race, and, ethnicity, in, those, ages, 12, and, older, it, was, observed, that, american, indian, alaskan, natives, were, among, the, highest, rates, and, asians, were, among, the, lowest, rates, in, comparison, to, other, racial, ethnic, groups, pacific, islander, alaskan, native, when, surveying, populations, based, on, gender, in, those, ages, 12, and, older, it, was, observed, that, males, had, a, higher, substance, dependence, rate, than, females, however, the, difference, in, the, rates, are, not, apparent, until, after, age, 17, alcohol, dependence, or, abuse, rates, were, shown, to, have, no, correspondence, with, any, person, s, education, level, when, populations, were, surveyed, in, varying, degrees, of, education, from, ages, 26, and, older, however, when, it, came, to, illicit, drug, use, there, was, a, correlation, in, which, those, that, graduated, from, college, had, the, lowest, rates, furthermore, dependence, rates, were, greater, in, unemployed, populations, ages, 18, and, older, and, in, metropolitan, residing, populations, ages, 12, and, older, the, national, opinion, research, center, at, the, university, of, chicago, reported, an, analysis, on, disparities, within, admissions, for, substance, abuse, treatment, in, the, appalachian, region, which, comprises, 13, states, and, 410, counties, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, u, s, while, their, findings, for, most, demographic, categories, were, similar, to, the, national, findings, by, nsduh, they, had, different, results, for, racial, ethnic, groups, which, varied, by, sub, regions, overall, whites, were, the, demographic, with, the, largest, admission, rate, 83, while, alaskan, native, american, indian, pacific, islander, and, asian, populations, had, the, lowest, admissions, 1, 8, depending, on, the, jurisdiction, addictive, drugs, may, be, legal, legal, only, as, part, of, a, government, sponsored, study, illegal, to, use, for, any, purpose, illegal, to, sell, or, even, illegal, to, merely, possess, most, countries, have, legislation, which, brings, various, drugs, and, drug, like, substances, under, the, control, of, licensing, systems, typically, this, legislation, covers, any, or, all, of, the, opiates, amphetamines, cannabinoids, cocaine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, anesthetics, hallucinogenics, derivatives, and, a, variety, of, more, modern, synthetic, drugs, unlicensed, production, supply, or, possession, is, a, criminal, offence, although, the, legislation, may, be, justifiable, on, moral, or, public, health, grounds, it, can, make, addiction, or, dependency, a, much, more, serious, issue, for, the, individual, reliable, supplies, of, a, drug, become, difficult, to, secure, and, the, individual, becomes, vulnerable, to, both, criminal, abuse, and, legal, punishment, it, is, unclear, whether, laws, against, illegal, drug, use, do, anything, to, stem, usage, and, dependency, in, jurisdictions, where, addictive, drugs, are, illegal, they, are, generally, supplied, by, drug, dealers, who, are, often, involved, with, organized, crime, even, though, the, cost, of, producing, most, illegal, addictive, substances, is, very, low, their, illegality, combined, with, the, addict, s, need, permits, the, seller, to, command, a, premium, price, often, hundreds, of, times, the, production, cost, as, a, result, addicts, sometimes, turn, to, crime, to, support, their, habit, in, the, united, states, drug,
