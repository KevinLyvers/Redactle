the, lion, panthera, leo, is, a, large, cat, of, the, genus, panthera, native, to, africa, and, india, it, has, a, muscular, broad, chested, body, a, short, rounded, head, round, ears, and, a, dark, hairy, tuft, at, the, tip, of, its, tail, it, is, sexually, dimorphic, adult, male, lions, are, larger, than, females, and, have, a, prominent, mane, it, is, a, social, species, forming, groups, called, prides, a, lion, s, pride, consists, of, a, few, adult, males, related, females, and, cubs, groups, of, female, lions, usually, hunt, together, preying, mostly, on, medium, sized, and, large, ungulates, the, lion, is, an, apex, and, keystone, predator, although, some, lions, scavenge, when, opportunities, occur, and, have, been, known, to, hunt, humans, lions, typically, do, not, actively, seek, out, and, prey, on, humans, the, lion, inhabits, grasslands, savannahs, and, shrublands, it, is, usually, more, diurnal, than, other, wild, cats, but, when, persecuted, it, adapts, to, being, active, at, night, and, at, twilight, during, the, neolithic, period, the, lion, ranged, throughout, africa, and, eurasia, from, southeast, europe, to, india, but, it, has, been, reduced, to, fragmented, populations, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, one, population, in, western, india, it, has, been, listed, as, vulnerable, on, the, iucn, red, list, since, 1996, because, populations, in, african, countries, have, declined, by, about, 43, since, the, early, 1990s, lion, populations, are, untenable, outside, designated, protected, areas, although, the, cause, of, the, decline, is, not, fully, understood, habitat, loss, and, conflicts, with, humans, are, the, greatest, causes, for, concern, one, of, the, most, widely, recognised, animal, symbols, in, human, culture, the, lion, has, been, extensively, depicted, in, sculptures, and, paintings, on, national, flags, and, in, literature, and, films, lions, have, been, kept, in, menageries, since, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, and, have, been, a, key, species, sought, for, exhibition, in, zoological, gardens, across, the, world, since, the, late, 18th, century, cultural, depictions, of, lions, were, prominent, in, ancient, egypt, and, depictions, have, occurred, in, virtually, all, ancient, and, medieval, cultures, in, the, lion, s, historic, and, current, range, the, english, word, lion, is, derived, via, anglo, norman, liun, from, latin, le, nem, nominative, le, which, in, turn, was, a, borrowing, from, ancient, greek, l, n, the, hebrew, word, lavi, may, also, be, related, the, generic, name, panthera, is, traceable, to, the, classical, latin, word, panth, ra, and, the, ancient, greek, word, panther, felis, leo, was, the, scientific, name, used, by, carl, linnaeus, in, 1758, who, described, the, lion, in, his, work, systema, naturae, the, genus, name, panthera, was, coined, by, lorenz, oken, in, 1816, between, the, mid, 18th, and, mid, 20th, centuries, 26, lion, specimens, were, described, and, proposed, as, subspecies, of, which, 11, were, recognised, as, valid, in, 2005, they, were, distinguished, mostly, by, the, size, and, colour, of, their, manes, and, skins, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, several, lion, type, specimens, were, described, and, proposed, as, subspecies, with, about, a, dozen, recognised, as, valid, taxa, until, 2017, between, 2008, and, 2016, iucn, red, list, assessors, used, only, two, subspecific, names, p, l, leo, for, african, lion, populations, and, p, l, persica, for, the, asiatic, lion, population, in, 2017, the, cat, classification, task, force, of, the, cat, specialist, group, revised, lion, taxonomy, and, recognises, two, subspecies, based, on, results, of, several, phylogeographic, studies, on, lion, evolution, namely, however, there, seems, to, be, some, degree, of, overlap, between, both, groups, in, northern, central, africa, dna, analysis, from, a, more, recent, study, indicates, that, central, african, lions, are, derived, from, both, northern, and, southern, lions, as, they, cluster, with, p, leo, leo, in, mtdna, based, phylogenies, whereas, their, genomic, dna, indicates, a, closer, relationship, with, p, leo, melanochaita, lion, samples, from, some, parts, of, the, ethiopian, highlands, cluster, genetically, with, those, from, cameroon, and, chad, while, lions, from, other, areas, of, ethiopia, cluster, with, samples, from, east, africa, researchers, therefore, assume, ethiopia, is, a, contact, zone, between, the, two, subspecies, genome, wide, data, of, a, wild, born, historical, lion, sample, from, sudan, showed, that, it, clustered, with, p, l, leo, in, mtdna, based, phylogenies, but, with, a, high, affinity, to, p, l, melanochaita, this, result, suggested, that, the, taxonomic, position, of, lions, in, central, africa, may, require, revision, other, lion, subspecies, or, sister, species, to, the, modern, lion, existed, in, prehistoric, times, the, panthera, lineage, is, estimated, to, have, genetically, diverged, from, the, common, ancestor, of, the, felidae, around, 9, 32, to, 4, 47, million, years, ago, to, 11, 75, to, 0, 97, million, years, ago, results, of, analyses, differ, in, the, phylogenetic, relationship, of, the, lion, it, was, thought, to, form, a, sister, group, with, the, jaguar, that, diverged, 3, 46, to, 1, 22, million, years, ago, but, also, with, the, leopard, that, diverged, 3, 1, to, 1, 95, million, years, ago, to, 4, 32, to, 0, 02, million, years, ago, hybridisation, between, lion, and, snow, leopard, ancestors, possibly, continued, until, about, 2, 1, million, years, ago, the, lion, leopard, clade, was, distributed, in, the, asian, and, african, palearctic, since, at, least, the, early, pliocene, the, earliest, fossils, recognisable, as, lions, were, found, at, olduvai, gorge, in, tanzania, and, are, estimated, to, be, up, to, 2, million, years, old, estimates, for, the, divergence, time, of, the, modern, and, cave, lion, lineages, range, from, 529, 000, to, 392, 000, years, ago, based, on, mutation, rate, per, generation, time, of, the, modern, lion, there, is, no, evidence, for, gene, flow, between, the, two, lineages, indicating, that, they, did, not, share, the, same, geographic, area, the, eurasian, and, american, cave, lions, became, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, last, glacial, period, without, mitochondrial, descendants, on, other, continents, the, modern, lion, was, probably, widely, distributed, in, africa, during, the, middle, pleistocene, and, started, to, diverge, in, sub, saharan, africa, during, the, late, pleistocene, lion, populations, in, east, and, southern, africa, became, separated, from, populations, in, west, and, north, africa, when, the, equatorial, rainforest, expanded, 183, 500, to, 81, 800, years, ago, they, shared, a, common, ancestor, probably, between, 98, 000, and, 52, 000, years, ago, due, to, the, expansion, of, the, sahara, between, 83, 100, and, 26, 600, years, ago, lion, populations, in, west, and, north, africa, became, separated, as, the, rainforest, decreased, and, thus, gave, rise, to, more, open, habitats, lions, moved, from, west, to, central, africa, lions, from, north, africa, dispersed, to, southern, europe, and, asia, between, 38, 800, and, 8, 300, years, ago, extinction, of, lions, in, southern, europe, north, africa, and, the, middle, east, interrupted, gene, flow, between, lion, populations, in, asia, and, africa, genetic, evidence, revealed, numerous, mutations, in, lion, samples, from, east, and, southern, africa, which, indicates, that, this, group, has, a, longer, evolutionary, history, than, genetically, less, diverse, lion, samples, from, asia, and, west, and, central, africa, a, whole, genome, wide, sequence, of, lion, samples, showed, that, samples, from, west, africa, shared, alleles, with, samples, from, southern, africa, and, samples, from, central, africa, shared, alleles, with, samples, from, asia, this, phenomenon, indicates, that, central, africa, was, a, melting, pot, of, lion, populations, after, they, had, become, isolated, possibly, migrating, through, corridors, in, the, nile, basin, during, the, early, holocene, in, zoos, lions, have, been, bred, with, tigers, to, create, hybrids, for, the, curiosity, of, visitors, or, for, scientific, purpose, the, liger, is, bigger, than, a, lion, and, a, tiger, whereas, most, tigons, are, relatively, small, compared, to, their, parents, because, of, reciprocal, gene, effects, the, leopon, is, a, hybrid, between, a, lion, and, leopard, the, lion, is, a, muscular, broad, chested, cat, with, a, short, rounded, head, a, reduced, neck, and, round, ears, males, have, broader, heads, the, fur, varies, in, colour, from, light, buff, to, silvery, grey, yellowish, red, and, dark, brown, the, colours, of, the, underparts, are, generally, lighter, a, new, born, lion, has, dark, spots, which, fade, as, the, cub, reaches, adulthood, although, faint, spots, may, still, be, seen, on, the, legs, and, underparts, the, tail, of, all, lions, ends, in, a, dark, hairy, tuft, that, in, some, lions, conceals, an, approximately, 5, mm, 0, 20, in, long, hard, spine, or, spur, that, is, formed, from, the, final, fused, sections, of, tail, bone, the, functions, of, the, spur, are, unknown, the, tuft, is, absent, at, birth, and, develops, at, around, 5, 1, 2, months, of, age, it, is, readily, identifiable, at, the, age, of, seven, months, its, skull, is, very, similar, to, that, of, the, tiger, although, the, frontal, region, is, usually, more, depressed, and, flattened, and, has, a, slightly, shorter, postorbital, region, and, broader, nasal, openings, than, those, of, the, tiger, due, to, the, amount, of, skull, variation, in, the, two, species, usually, only, the, structure, of, the, lower, jaw, can, be, used, as, a, reliable, indicator, of, species, the, skeletal, muscles, of, the, lion, make, up, 58, 8, of, its, body, weight, and, represent, the, highest, percentage, of, muscles, among, mammals, the, lion, has, a, high, concentration, of, glycolytic, fast, twitch, muscle, fibers, among, felids, the, lion, is, second, only, to, the, tiger, in, size, the, size, and, weight, of, adult, lions, vary, across, its, range, and, habitats, accounts, of, a, few, individuals, that, were, larger, than, average, exist, from, africa, and, india, the, male, lion, s, mane, is, the, most, recognisable, feature, of, the, species, it, may, have, evolved, around, 320, 000, 190, 000, years, ago, it, grows, downwards, and, backwards, covering, most, of, the, head, neck, shoulders, and, chest, the, mane, is, typically, brownish, and, tinged, with, yellow, rust, and, black, hairs, it, starts, growing, when, lions, enter, adolescence, when, testosterone, levels, increase, and, reach, their, full, size, at, around, four, years, old, cool, ambient, temperatures, in, european, and, north, american, zoos, may, result, in, a, heavier, mane, on, average, asiatic, lions, have, sparser, manes, than, african, lions, this, feature, likely, evolved, to, signal, the, fitness, of, males, to, females, males, with, darker, manes, appear, to, have, greater, reproductive, success, and, are, more, likely, to, remain, in, a, pride, for, longer, they, have, longer, and, thicker, hair, and, higher, testosterone, levels, but, they, are, also, more, vulnerable, to, heat, stress, unlike, in, other, felid, species, female, lions, consistently, interact, with, multiple, males, at, once, another, hypothesis, suggests, that, the, mane, also, serves, to, protect, the, neck, in, fights, but, this, is, disputed, during, fights, including, those, involving, maneless, females, and, adolescents, the, neck, is, not, targeted, as, much, as, the, face, back, and, hindquarters, injured, lions, also, begin, to, lose, their, manes, almost, all, male, lions, in, pendjari, national, park, are, either, maneless, or, have, very, short, manes, maneless, lions, have, also, been, reported, in, senegal, in, sudan, s, dinder, national, park, and, in, tsavo, east, national, park, kenya, castrated, lions, often, have, little, to, no, mane, because, the, removal, of, the, gonads, inhibits, testosterone, production, rarely, lionesses, in, the, wild, and, in, captivity, have, been, observed, to, grow, manes, increased, testosterone, may, be, the, cause, of, maned, lionesses, reported, in, northern, botswana, the, white, lion, is, a, rare, morph, with, a, genetic, condition, called, leucism, which, is, caused, by, a, double, recessive, allele, it, is, not, albino, it, has, normal, pigmentation, in, the, eyes, and, skin, white, lions, have, occasionally, been, encountered, in, and, around, kruger, national, park, and, the, adjacent, timbavati, private, game, reserve, in, eastern, south, africa, they, were, removed, from, the, wild, in, the, 1970s, thus, decreasing, the, white, lion, gene, pool, nevertheless, 17, births, have, been, recorded, in, five, prides, between, 2007, and, 2015, white, lions, are, selected, for, breeding, in, captivity, they, have, reportedly, been, bred, in, camps, in, south, africa, for, use, as, trophies, to, be, killed, during, canned, hunts, african, lions, live, in, scattered, populations, across, sub, saharan, africa, the, lion, prefers, grassy, plains, and, savannahs, scrub, bordering, rivers, and, open, woodlands, with, bushes, it, rarely, enters, closed, forests, on, mount, elgon, the, lion, has, been, recorded, up, to, an, elevation, of, 3, 600, m, 11, 800, ft, and, close, to, the, snow, line, on, mount, kenya, savannahs, with, an, annual, rainfall, of, 300, to, 1, 500, mm, 12, to, 59, in, make, up, the, majority, of, lion, habitat, in, africa, estimated, at, 3, 390, 821, km, 2, 1, 309, 203, sq, mi, at, most, but, remnant, populations, are, also, present, in, tropical, moist, forests, in, west, africa, and, montane, forests, in, east, africa, the, asiatic, lion, now, survives, only, in, and, around, gir, national, park, in, gujarat, western, india, its, habitat, is, a, mixture, of, dry, savannah, forest, and, very, dry, deciduous, scrub, forest, in, africa, the, range, of, the, lion, originally, spanned, most, of, the, central, african, rainforest, zone, and, the, sahara, desert, in, the, 1960s, it, became, extinct, in, north, africa, except, in, the, southern, part, of, sudan, during, the, mid, holocene, around, 8, 000, 6, 000, years, ago, the, range, of, lions, expanded, into, southeastern, and, eastern, europe, partially, re, occupying, the, range, of, the, now, extinct, cave, lion, in, hungary, the, modern, lion, was, present, from, about, 4, 500, to, 3, 200, years, before, present, in, ukraine, the, modern, lion, was, present, from, about, 6, 400, to, 2, 000, years, before, present, in, greece, it, was, common, as, reported, by, herodotus, in, 480, bc, it, was, considered, rare, by, 300, bc, and, extirpated, by, ad, 100, in, asia, the, lion, once, ranged, in, regions, where, climatic, conditions, supported, an, abundance, of, prey, it, was, present, in, the, caucasus, until, the, 10th, century, it, lived, in, palestine, until, the, middle, ages, and, in, southwest, asia, until, the, late, 19th, century, by, the, late, 19th, century, it, had, been, extirpated, in, most, of, turkey, the, last, live, lion, in, iran, was, sighted, in, 1942, about, 65, km, 40, mi, northwest, of, dezful, although, the, corpse, of, a, lioness, was, found, on, the, banks, of, the, karun, river, in, khuzestan, province, in, 1944, it, once, ranged, from, sind, and, punjab, in, pakistan, to, bengal, and, the, narmada, river, in, central, india, lions, spend, much, of, their, time, resting, they, are, inactive, for, about, twenty, hours, per, day, although, lions, can, be, active, at, any, time, their, activity, generally, peaks, after, dusk, with, a, period, of, socialising, grooming, and, defecating, intermittent, bursts, of, activity, continue, until, dawn, when, hunting, most, often, takes, place, they, spend, an, average, of, two, hours, a, day, walking, and, fifty, minutes, eating, the, lion, is, the, most, social, of, all, wild, felid, species, living, in, groups, of, related, individuals, with, their, offspring, such, a, group, is, called, a, pride, groups, of, male, lions, are, called, coalitions, females, form, the, stable, social, unit, in, a, pride, and, do, not, tolerate, outside, females, the, majority, of, females, remain, in, their, birth, prides, while, all, males, and, some, females, will, disperse, the, average, pride, consists, of, around, 15, lions, including, several, adult, females, and, up, to, four, males, and, their, cubs, of, both, sexes, large, prides, consisting, of, up, to, 30, individuals, have, been, observed, the, sole, exception, to, this, pattern, is, the, tsavo, lion, pride, that, always, has, just, one, adult, male, prides, act, as, fission, fusion, societies, and, members, will, split, into, subgroups, that, keep, in, contact, with, roars, nomadic, lions, range, widely, and, move, around, sporadically, either, in, pairs, or, alone, pairs, are, more, frequent, among, related, males, a, lion, may, switch, lifestyles, nomads, can, become, residents, and, vice, versa, interactions, between, prides, and, nomads, tend, to, be, hostile, although, pride, females, in, estrus, allow, nomadic, males, to, approach, them, males, spend, years, in, a, nomadic, phase, before, gaining, residence, in, a, pride, a, study, undertaken, in, the, serengeti, national, park, revealed, that, nomadic, coalitions, gain, residency, at, between, 3, 5, and, 7, 3, years, of, age, in, kruger, national, park, dispersing, male, lions, move, more, than, 25, km, 16, mi, away, from, their, natal, pride, in, search, of, their, own, territory, female, lions, stay, closer, to, their, natal, pride, therefore, female, lions, in, an, area, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, male, lions, in, the, same, area, the, evolution, of, sociability, in, lions, was, likely, driven, both, by, high, population, density, and, the, clumped, resources, of, savannah, habitats, the, larger, the, pride, the, more, high, quality, territory, they, can, defend, hotspots, being, near, river, confluences, where, the, cats, have, better, access, to, water, prey, and, shelter, via, vegetation, the, area, occupied, by, a, pride, is, called, a, pride, area, whereas, that, occupied, by, a, nomad, is, a, range, males, associated, with, a, pride, patrol, the, fringes, both, males, and, females, defend, the, pride, against, intruders, but, the, male, lion, is, better, suited, for, this, purpose, due, to, its, stockier, more, powerful, build, some, individuals, consistently, lead, the, defense, against, intruders, while, others, lag, behind, lions, tend, to, assume, specific, roles, in, the, pride, slower, moving, individuals, may, provide, other, valuable, services, to, the, group, alternatively, there, may, be, rewards, associated, with, being, a, leader, that, fends, off, intruders, the, rank, of, lionesses, in, the, pride, is, reflected, in, these, responses, the, male, or, males, associated, with, the, pride, must, defend, their, relationship, with, the, pride, from, outside, males, who, may, attempt, to, usurp, them, dominance, hierarchies, do, not, appear, to, exist, among, individuals, of, either, sex, in, a, pride, asiatic, lion, prides, differ, in, group, composition, male, asiatic, lions, are, solitary, or, associate, with, up, to, three, males, forming, a, loose, pride, while, females, associate, with, up, to, 12, other, females, forming, a, stronger, pride, together, with, their, cubs, female, and, male, lions, associate, only, when, mating, coalitions, of, males, hold, territory, for, a, longer, time, than, single, lions, males, in, coalitions, of, three, or, four, individuals, exhibit, a, pronounced, hierarchy, in, which, one, male, dominates, the, others, and, mates, more, frequently, the, lion, is, a, generalist, hypercarnivore, and, is, considered, to, be, both, an, apex, and, keystone, predator, due, to, its, wide, prey, spectrum, its, prey, consists, mainly, of, medium, sized, to, large, ungulates, particularly, blue, wildebeest, plains, zebra, african, buffalo, gemsbok, and, giraffe, they, also, frequently, take, common, warthog, despite, it, being, much, smaller, in, india, chital, and, sambar, deer, are, the, most, common, wild, prey, while, livestock, contributes, significantly, to, lion, kills, outside, protected, areas, they, usually, avoid, fully, grown, adult, elephants, rhinoceroses, and, hippopotamus, and, small, prey, like, dik, dik, hyraxes, hares, and, monkeys, unusual, prey, include, porcupines, and, small, reptiles, lions, kill, other, predators, but, seldom, consume, them, young, lions, first, display, stalking, behaviour, at, around, three, months, of, age, although, they, do, not, participate, in, hunting, until, they, are, almost, a, year, old, and, begin, to, hunt, effectively, when, nearing, the, age, of, two, single, lions, are, capable, of, bringing, down, zebra, and, wildebeest, while, larger, prey, like, buffalo, and, giraffe, are, riskier, in, chobe, national, park, large, prides, have, been, observed, hunting, african, bush, elephants, up, to, around, 15, years, old, in, exceptional, cases, with, the, victims, being, calves, juveniles, and, even, subadults, in, typical, hunts, each, lioness, has, a, favoured, position, in, the, group, either, stalking, prey, on, the, wing, then, attacking, or, moving, a, smaller, distance, in, the, centre, of, the, group, and, capturing, prey, fleeing, from, other, lionesses, males, attached, to, prides, do, not, usually, participate, in, group, hunting, some, evidence, suggests, however, that, males, are, just, as, successful, as, females, they, are, typically, solo, hunters, who, ambush, prey, in, small, bushland, they, may, join, in, the, hunting, of, large, slower, moving, prey, like, buffalo, and, even, hunt, them, on, their, own, moderately, sized, hunting, groups, generally, have, higher, success, rates, than, lone, females, and, larger, groups, lions, are, not, particularly, known, for, their, stamina, for, instance, a, lioness, s, heart, comprises, only, 0, 57, of, her, body, weight, and, a, male, s, is, about, 0, 45, of, his, body, weight, whereas, a, hyena, s, heart, comprises, almost, 1, of, its, body, weight, thus, lions, run, quickly, only, in, short, bursts, at, about, 48, 59, km, h, 30, 37, mph, and, need, to, be, close, to, their, prey, before, starting, the, attack, one, study, in, 2018, recorded, a, lion, running, at, a, top, speed, of, 74, 1, km, h, 46, 0, mph, they, take, advantage, of, factors, that, reduce, visibility, many, kills, take, place, near, some, form, of, cover, or, at, night, the, lion, accelerates, at, the, start, of, the, chase, by, 9, 5, m, s, whereas, plains, zebras, wildebeest, and, thomson, s, gazelle, accelerate, by, 5, m, s, 5, 6, m, s, and, 4, 5, m, s, respectively, acceleration, appears, to, be, more, important, than, steady, displacement, speed, in, lion, hunts, the, lion, s, attack, is, short, and, powerful, it, attempts, to, catch, prey, with, a, fast, rush, and, final, leap, usually, pulls, it, down, by, the, rump, and, kills, with, a, clamping, bite, to, the, throat, or, muzzle, it, can, hold, the, prey, s, throat, for, up, to, 13, minutes, until, the, prey, stops, moving, it, has, a, bite, force, of, 1314, 7, newton, at, the, canine, tip, and, 2023, 7, newton, at, the, carnassial, notch, lions, typically, consume, prey, at, the, location, of, the, hunt, but, sometimes, drag, large, prey, into, cover, they, tend, to, squabble, over, kills, particularly, the, males, cubs, suffer, most, when, food, is, scarce, but, otherwise, all, pride, members, eat, their, fill, including, old, and, crippled, lions, which, can, live, on, leftovers, large, kills, are, shared, more, widely, among, pride, members, an, adult, lioness, requires, an, average, of, about, 5, kg, 11, lb, of, meat, per, day, while, males, require, about, 7, kg, 15, lb, lions, gorge, themselves, and, eat, up, to, 30, kg, 66, lb, in, one, session, if, it, is, unable, to, consume, all, of, the, kill, it, rests, for, a, few, hours, before, continuing, to, eat, on, hot, days, the, pride, retreats, to, shade, with, one, or, two, males, standing, guard, lions, defend, their, kills, from, scavengers, such, as, vultures, and, hyenas, lions, scavenge, on, carrion, when, the, opportunity, arises, scavenging, animals, dead, from, natural, causes, such, as, disease, or, those, that, were, killed, by, other, predators, scavenging, lions, keep, a, constant, lookout, for, circling, vultures, which, indicate, the, death, or, distress, of, an, animal, most, carrion, on, which, both, hyenas, and, lions, feed, upon, are, killed, by, hyenas, rather, than, lions, carrion, is, thought, to, provide, a, large, part, of, lion, diet, lions, and, spotted, hyenas, occupy, a, similar, ecological, niche, and, compete, for, prey, and, carrion, a, review, of, data, across, several, studies, indicates, a, dietary, overlap, of, 58, 6, lions, typically, ignore, hyenas, unless, they, are, on, a, kill, or, are, being, harassed, while, the, latter, tend, to, visibly, react, to, the, presence, of, lions, with, or, without, the, presence, of, food, in, the, ngorongoro, crater, lions, subsist, largely, on, kills, stolen, from, hyenas, causing, them, to, increase, their, kill, rate, in, botswana, s, chobe, national, park, the, situation, is, reversed, as, hyenas, there, frequently, challenge, lions, and, steal, their, kills, obtaining, food, from, 63, of, all, lion, kills, when, confronted, on, a, kill, hyenas, may, either, leave, or, wait, patiently, at, a, distance, of, 30, 100, m, 98, 328, ft, until, the, lions, have, finished, hyenas, may, feed, alongside, lions, and, force, them, off, a, kill, the, two, species, attack, one, another, even, when, there, is, no, food, involved, for, no, apparent, reason, lions, can, account, for, up, to, 71, of, hyena, deaths, in, etosha, national, park, hyenas, have, adapted, by, frequently, mobbing, lions, that, enter, their, home, ranges, when, the, lion, population, in, kenya, s, masai, mara, national, reserve, declined, the, spotted, hyena, population, increased, rapidly, lions, tend, to, dominate, cheetahs, and, leopards, steal, their, kills, and, kill, their, cubs, and, even, adults, when, given, the, chance, cheetahs, often, lose, their, kills, to, lions, or, other, predators, a, study, in, the, serengeti, ecosystem, revealed, that, lions, killed, at, least, 17, of, 125, cheetah, cubs, born, between, 1987, and, 1990, cheetahs, avoid, their, competitors, by, hunting, at, different, times, and, habitats, leopards, by, contrast, do, not, appear, to, be, motivated, by, an, avoidance, of, lions, as, they, use, heavy, vegetation, regardless, of, whether, lions, are, present, in, an, area, and, both, cats, are, active, around, the, same, time, of, day, in, addition, there, is, no, evidence, that, lions, effect, leopard, abundance, leopards, take, refuge, in, trees, though, lionesses, occasionally, attempt, to, climb, up, and, retrieve, their, kills, lions, similarly, dominate, african, wild, dogs, taking, their, kills, and, dispatching, pups, or, adult, dogs, population, densities, of, wild, dogs, are, low, in, areas, where, lions, are, more, abundant, however, there, are, a, few, reported, cases, of, old, and, wounded, lions, falling, prey, to, wild, dogs, most, lionesses, reproduce, by, the, time, they, are, four, years, of, age, lions, do, not, mate, at, a, specific, time, of, year, and, the, females, are, polyestrous, like, those, of, other, cats, the, male, lion, s, penis, has, spines, that, point, backward, during, withdrawal, of, the, penis, the, spines, rake, the, walls, of, the, female, s, vagina, which, may, cause, ovulation, a, lioness, may, mate, with, more, than, one, male, when, she, is, in, heat, lions, of, both, sexes, may, be, involved, in, group, homosexual, and, courtship, activities, males, will, also, head, rub, and, roll, around, with, each, other, before, mounting, each, other, generation, length, of, the, lion, is, about, seven, years, the, average, gestation, period, is, around, 110, days, the, female, gives, birth, to, a, litter, of, between, one, and, four, cubs, in, a, secluded, den, which, may, be, a, thicket, a, reed, bed, a, cave, or, some, other, sheltered, area, usually, away, from, the, pride, she, will, often, hunt, alone, while, the, cubs, are, still, helpless, staying, relatively, close, to, the, den, lion, cubs, are, born, blind, their, eyes, opening, around, seven, days, after, birth, they, weigh, 1, 2, 2, 1,

attracting, the, attention, of, predators, the, lioness, moves, her, cubs, to, a, new, den, site, several, times, a, month, carrying, them, one, by, one, by, the, nape, of, the, neck, usually, the, mother, does, not, integrate, herself, and, her, cubs, back, into, the, pride, until, the, cubs, are, six, to, eight, weeks, old, sometimes, the, introduction, to, pride, life, occurs, earlier, particularly, if, other, lionesses, have, given, birth, at, about, the, same, time, when, first, introduced, to, the, rest, of, the, pride, lion, cubs, lack, confidence, when, confronted, with, adults, other, than, their, mother, they, soon, begin, to, immerse, themselves, in, the, pride, life, however, playing, among, themselves, or, attempting, to, initiate, play, with, the, adults, lionesses, with, cubs, of, their, own, are, more, likely, to, be, tolerant, of, another, lioness, s, cubs, than, lionesses, without, cubs, male, tolerance, of, the, cubs, varies, one, male, could, patiently, let, the, cubs, play, with, his, tail, or, his, mane, while, another, may, snarl, and, bat, the, cubs, away, pride, lionesses, often, synchronise, their, reproductive, cycles, and, communal, rearing, and, suckling, of, the, young, which, suckle, indiscriminately, from, any, or, all, of, the, nursing, females, in, the, pride, the, synchronisation, of, births, is, advantageous, because, the, cubs, grow, to, being, roughly, the, same, size, and, have, an, equal, chance, of, survival, and, sucklings, are, not, dominated, by, older, cubs, weaning, occurs, after, six, or, seven, months, male, lions, reach, maturity, at, about, three, years, of, age, and, at, four, to, five, years, are, capable, of, challenging, and, displacing, adult, males, associated, with, another, pride, they, begin, to, age, and, weaken, at, between, 10, and, 15, years, of, age, at, the, latest, when, one, or, more, new, males, oust, the, previous, males, associated, with, a, pride, the, victors, often, kill, any, existing, young, cubs, perhaps, because, females, do, not, become, fertile, and, receptive, until, their, cubs, mature, or, die, females, often, fiercely, defend, their, cubs, from,

a, fight, or, confrontation, males, tend, to, rub, other, males, while, cubs, and, females, rub, females, social, licking, often, occurs, in, tandem, with, head, rubbing, it, is, generally, mutual, and, the, recipient, appears, to, express, pleasure, the, head, and, neck, are, the, most, common, parts, of, the, body, licked, this, behaviour, may, have, arisen, out, of, utility, because, lions, cannot, lick, these, areas, themselves, lions, have, an, array, of, facial, expressions, and, body, postures, that, serve, as, visual, gestures, a, common, facial, expression, is, the, grimace, face, or, flehmen, response, which, a, lion, makes, when, sniffing, chemical, signals, and, involves, an, open, mouth, with, bared, teeth, raised, muzzle, wrinkled, nose, closed, eyes, and, relaxed, ears,

host, large, lion, populations, where, an, infrastructure, for, wildlife, tourism, has, been, developed, cash, revenue, for, park, management, and, local, communities, is, a, strong, incentive, for, lion, conservation, most, lions, now, live, in, east, and, southern, africa, their, numbers, are, rapidly, decreasing, and, fell, by, an, estimated, 30, 50, in, the, late, half, of, the, 20th, century, primary, causes, of, the, decline, include, disease, and, human, interference, in, 1975, it, was, estimated, that, since, the, 1950s, lion, numbers, had, decreased, by, half, to, 200, 000, or, fewer, estimates, of, the, african, lion, population, range, between, 16, 500, and, 47, 000, living, in, the, wild, in, 2002, 2004, in, the, republic, of, the, congo, odzala, kokoua, national, park, was, considered, a, lion, stronghold, in, the, 1990s, by, 2014, no, lions, were, recorded, in, the, protected, area, so, the, population, is, considered, locally, extinct, the, west, african, lion, population, is, isolated, from, the, one, in, central, africa, with, little, or, no, exchange, of, breeding, individuals, in, 2015, it, was, estimated, that, this, population, consists, of, about, 400, animals, including, fewer, than, 250, mature, individuals, they, persist, in, three, protected, areas, in, the, region, mostly, in, one, population, in, the, w, a, p, protected, area, complex, shared, by, benin, burkina, faso, and, niger, this, population, is, listed, as, critically, endangered, field, surveys, in, the, wap, ecosystem, revealed, that, lion, occupancy, is, lowest, in, the, w, national, park, and, higher, in, areas, with, permanent, staff, and, thus, better, protection, a, population, occurs, in, cameroon, s, waza, national, park, where, between, approximately, 14, and, 21, animals, persisted, as, of, 2009, in, addition, 50, to, 150, lions, are, estimated, to, be, present, in, burkina, faso, s, arly, singou, ecosystem, in, 2015, an, adult, male, lion, and, a, female, lion, were, sighted, in, ghana, s, mole, national, park, these, were, the, first, sightings, of, lions, in, the, country, in, 39, years, in, the, same, year, a, population, of, up, to, 200, lions, that, was, previously, thought, to, have, been, extirpated, was, filmed, in, the, alatash, national, park, ethiopia, close, to, the, sudanese, border, in, 2005, lion, conservation, strategies, were, developed, for, west, and, central, africa, and, or, east, and, southern, africa, the, strategies, seek, to, maintain, suitable, habitat, ensure, a, sufficient, wild, prey, base, for, lions, reduce, factors, that, lead, to, further, fragmentation, of, populations, and, make, lion, human, coexistence, sustainable, lion, depredation, on, livestock, is, significantly, reduced, in, areas, where, herders, keep, livestock, in, improved, enclosures, such, measures, contribute, to, mitigating, human, lion, conflict, the, last, refuge, of, the, asiatic, lion, population, is, the, 1, 412, km, 2, 545, sq, mi, gir, national, park, and, surrounding, areas, in, the, region, of, saurashtra, or, kathiawar, peninsula, in, gujarat, state, india, the, population, has, risen, from, approximately, 180, lions, in, 1974, to, about, 400, in, 2010, it, is, geographically, isolated, which, can, lead, to, inbreeding, and, reduced, genetic, diversity, since, 2008, the, asiatic, lion, has, been, listed, as, endangered, on, the, iucn, red, list, by, 2015, the, population, had, grown, to, 523, individuals, inhabiting, an, area, of, 7, 000, km, 2, 2, 700, sq, mi, in, saurashtra, in, 2017, about, 650, individuals, were, recorded, during, the, asiatic, lion, census, the, presence, of, numerous, human, settlements, close, to, gir, national, park, resulted, in, conflict, between, lions, local, people, and, their, livestock, some, consider, the, presence, of, lions, a, benefit, as, they, keep, populations, of, crop, damaging, herbivores, in, check, lions, imported, to, europe, before, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, were, possibly, foremost, barbary, lions, from, north, africa, or, cape, lions, from, southern, africa, another, 11, animals, thought, to, be, barbary, lions, kept, in, addis, ababa, zoo, are, descendants, of, animals, owned, by, emperor, haile, selassie, wildlink, international, in, collaboration, with, oxford, university, launched, an, ambitious, international, barbary, lion, project, with, the, aim, of, identifying, and, breeding, barbary, lions, in, captivity, for, eventual, reintroduction, into, a, national, park, in, the, atlas, mountains, of, morocco, however, a, genetic, analysis, showed, that, the, captive, lions, at, addis, ababa, zoo, were, not, barbary, lions, but, rather, closely, related, to, wild, lions, in, chad, and, cameroon, in, 1982, the, association, of, zoos, and, aquariums, started, a, species, survival, plan, for, the, asiatic, lion, to, increase, its, chances, of, survival, in, 1987, it, was, found, that, most, lions, in, north, american, zoos, were, hybrids, between, african, and, asiatic, lions, breeding, programs, need, to, note, origins, of, the, participating, animals, to, avoid, cross, breeding, different, subspecies, and, thus, reducing, their, conservation, value, captive, breeding, of, lions, was, halted, to, eliminate, individuals, of, unknown, origin, and, pedigree, wild, born, lions, were, imported, to, american, zoos, from, africa, between, 1989, and, 1995, breeding, was, continued, in, 1998, in, the, frame, of, an, african, lion, species, survival, plan, about, 77, of, the, captive, lions, registered, in, the, international, species, information, system, in, 2006, were, of, unknown, origin, these, animals, might, have, carried, genes, that, are, extinct, in, the, wild, and, may, therefore, be, important, to, the, maintenance, of, the, overall, genetic, variability, of, the, lion, lions, are, part, of, a, group, of, exotic, animals, that, have, been, central, to, zoo, exhibits, since, the, late, 18th, century, although, many, modern, zoos, are, more, selective, about, their, exhibits, there, are, more, than, 1, 000, african, and, 100, asiatic, lions, in, zoos, and, wildlife, parks, around, the, world, they, are, considered, an, ambassador, species, and, are, kept, for, tourism, education, and, conservation, purposes, lions, can, live, over, twenty, years, in, captivity, for, example, three, sibling, lions, at, the, honolulu, zoo, lived, to, the, age, of, 22, in, 2007, the, first, european, zoos, spread, among, noble, and, royal, families, in, the, 13th, century, and, until, the, 17th, century, were, called, seraglios, at, that, time, they, came, to, be, called, menageries, an, extension, of, the, cabinet, of, curiosities, they, spread, from, france, and, italy, during, the, renaissance, to, the, rest, of, europe, in, england, although, the, seraglio, tradition, was, less, developed, lions, were, kept, at, the, tower, of, london, in, a, seraglio, established, by, king, john, in, the, 13th, century, this, was, probably, stocked, with, animals, from, an, earlier, menagerie, started, in, 1125, by, henry, i, at, his, hunting, lodge, in, woodstock, oxfordshire, where, according, to, william, of, malmesbury, lions, had, been, stocked, lions, were, kept, in, cramped, and, squalid, conditions, at, london, zoo, until, a, larger, lion, house, with, roomier, cages, was, built, in, the, 1870s, further, changes, took, place, in, the, early, 20th, century, when, carl, hagenbeck, designed, enclosures, with, concrete, rocks, more, open, space, and, a, moat, instead, of, bars, more, closely, resembling, a, natural, habitat, hagenbeck, designed, lion, enclosures, for, both, melbourne, zoo, and, sydney, s, taronga, zoo, although, his, designs, were, popular, the, use, of, bars, and, caged, enclosures, prevailed, in, many, zoos, until, the, 1960s, in, the, late, 20th, century, larger, more, natural, enclosures, and, the, use, of, wire, mesh, or, laminated, glass, instead, of, lowered, dens, allowed, visitors, to, come, closer, than, ever, to, the, animals, some, attractions, such, as, the, cat, forest, lion, overlook, of, oklahoma, city, zoological, park, placed, the, den, on, ground, level, higher, than, visitors, lion, taming, has, been, part, of, both, established, circuses, and, individual, acts, such, as, siegfried, roy, the, practice, began, in, the, early, 19th, century, by, frenchman, henri, martin, and, american, isaac, van, amburgh, who, both, toured, widely, and, whose, techniques, were, copied, by, a, number, of, followers, van, amburgh, performed, before, queen, victoria, in, 1838, when, he, toured, great, britain, martin, composed, a, pantomime, titled, les, lions, de, mysore, the, lions, of, mysore, an, idea, amburgh, quickly, borrowed, these, acts, eclipsed, equestrianism, acts, as, the, central, display, of, circus, shows, and, entered, public, consciousness, in, the, early, 20th, century, with, cinema, in, demonstrating, the, superiority, of, human, over, animal, lion, taming, served, a, purpose, similar, to, animal, fights, of, previous, centuries, the, ultimate, proof, of, a, tamer, s, dominance, and, control, over, a, lion, is, demonstrated, by, the, placing, of, the, tamer, s, head, in, the, lion, s, mouth, the, now, iconic, lion, tamer, s, chair, was, possibly, first, used, by, american, clyde, beatty, 1903, 1965, lion, hunting, has, occurred, since, ancient, times, and, was, often, a, royal, tradition, intended, to, demonstrate, the, power, of, the, king, over, nature, such, hunts, took, place, in, a, reserved, area, in, front, of, an, audience, the, monarch, was, accompanied, by, his, men, and, controls, were, put, in, place, to, increase, their, safety, and, ease, of, killing, the, earliest, surviving, record, of, lion, hunting, is, an, ancient, egyptian, inscription, dated, circa, 1380, bc, that, mentions, pharaoh, amenhotep, iii, killing, 102, lions, in, ten, years, with, his, own, arrows, the, assyrian, emperor, ashurbanipal, had, one, of, his, lion, hunts, depicted, on, a, sequence, of, assyrian, palace, reliefs, c, 640, bc, known, as, the, lion, hunt, of, ashurbanipal, lions, were, also, hunted, during, the, mughal, empire, where, emperor, jahangir, is, said, to, have, excelled, at, it, in, ancient, rome, lions, were, kept, by, emperors, for, hunts, gladiator, fights, and, executions, the, maasai, people, have, traditionally, viewed, the, killing, of, lions, as, a, rite, of, passage, historically, lions, were, hunted, by, individuals, however, due, to, reduced, lion, populations, elders, discourage, solo, lion, hunts, during, the, european, colonisation, of, africa, in, the, 19th, century, the, hunting, of, lions, was, encouraged, because, they, were, considered, pests, and, lion, skins, were, sold, for, 1, each, the, widely, reproduced, imagery, of, the, heroic, hunter, chasing, lions, would, dominate, a, large, part, of, the, century, trophy, hunting, of, lions, in, recent, years, has, been, met, with, controversy, notably, with, the, killing, of, cecil, the, lion, in, mid, 2015, lions, do, not, usually, hunt, humans, but, some, usually, males, seem, to, seek, them, out, one, well, publicised, case, is, the, tsavo, maneaters, in, 1898, 28, officially, recorded, railway, workers, building, the, uganda, railway, were, taken, by, lions, over, nine, months, during, the, construction, of, a, bridge, in, kenya, the, hunter, who, killed, the, lions, wrote, a, book, detailing, the, animals, predatory, behaviour, they, were, larger, than, normal, and, lacked, manes, and, one, seemed, to, suffer, from, tooth, decay, the, infirmity, theory, including, tooth, decay, is, not, favoured, by, all, researchers, an, analysis, of, teeth, and, jaws, of, man, eating, lions, in, museum, collections, suggests, that, while, tooth, decay, may, explain, some, incidents, prey, depletion, in, human, dominated, areas, is, a, more, likely, cause, of, lion, predation, on, humans, sick, or, injured, animals, may, be, more, prone, to, man, eating, but, the, behaviour, is, not, unusual, nor, necessarily, aberrant, lions, proclivity, for, man, eating, has, been, systematically, examined, american, and, tanzanian, scientists, report, that, man, eating, behaviour, in, rural, areas, of, tanzania, increased, greatly, from, 1990, to, 2005, at, least, 563, villagers, were, attacked, and, many, eaten, over, this, period, the, incidents, occurred, near, selous, game, reserve, in, rufiji, river, and, in, lindi, region, near, the, mozambican, border, while, the, expansion, of, villages, into, bush, country, is, one, concern, the, authors, argue, conservation, policy, must, mitigate, the, danger, because, in, this, case, conservation, contributes, directly, to, human, deaths, cases, in, lindi, in, which, lions, seize, humans, from, the, centres, of, substantial, villages, have, been, documented, another, study, of, 1, 000, people, attacked, by, lions, in, southern, tanzania, between, 1988, and, 2009, found, that, the, weeks, following, the, full, moon, when, there, was, less, moonlight, were, a, strong, indicator, of, increased, night, time, attacks, on, people, according, to, robert, r, frump, mozambican, refugees, regularly, crossing, kruger, national, park, south,
