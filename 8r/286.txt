https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golgi_apparatus
the, golgi, apparatus, l, d, i, also, known, as, the, golgi, complex, golgi, body, or, simply, the, golgi, is, an, organelle, found, in, most, eukaryotic, cells, part, of, the, endomembrane, system, in, the, cytoplasm, it, packages, proteins, into, membrane, bound, vesicles, inside, the, cell, before, the, vesicles, are, sent, to, their, destination, it, resides, at, the, intersection, of, the, secretory, lysosomal, and, endocytic, pathways, it, is, of, particular, importance, in, processing, proteins, for, secretion, containing, a, set, of, glycosylation, enzymes, that, attach, various, sugar, monomers, to, proteins, as, the, proteins, move, through, the, apparatus, the, golgi, apparatus, was, identified, in, 1898, by, the, italian, biologist, and, pathologist, camillo, golgi, the, organelle, was, later, named, after, him, in, the, 1910s, owing, to, its, large, size, and, distinctive, structure, the, golgi, apparatus, was, one, of, the, first, organelles, to, be, discovered, and, observed, in, detail, it, was, discovered, in, 1898, by, italian, physician, camillo, golgi, during, an, investigation, of, the, nervous, system, after, first, observing, it, under, his, microscope, he, termed, the, structure, as, apparato, reticolare, interno, internal, reticular, apparatus, some, doubted, the, discovery, at, first, arguing, that, the, appearance, of, the, structure, was, merely, an, optical, illusion, created, by, the, observation, technique, used, by, golgi, with, the, development, of, modern, microscopes, in, the, twentieth, century, the, discovery, was, confirmed, early, references, to, the, golgi, apparatus, referred, to, it, by, various, names, including, the, golgi, holmgren, apparatus, golgi, holmgren, ducts, and, golgi, kopsch, apparatus, the, term, golgi, apparatus, was, used, in, 1910, and, first, appeared, in, the, scientific, literature, in, 1913, while, golgi, complex, was, introduced, in, 1956, the, subcellular, localization, of, the, golgi, apparatus, varies, among, eukaryotes, in, mammals, a, single, golgi, apparatus, is, usually, located, near, the, cell, nucleus, close, to, the, centrosome, tubular, connections, are, responsible, for, linking, the, stacks, together, localization, and, tubular, connections, of, the, golgi, apparatus, are, dependent, on, microtubules, in, experiments, it, is, seen, that, as, microtubules, are, depolymerized, the, golgi, apparatuses, lose, mutual, connections, and, become, individual, stacks, throughout, the, cytoplasm, in, yeast, multiple, golgi, apparatuses, are, scattered, throughout, the, cytoplasm, as, observed, in, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, in, plants, golgi, stacks, are, not, concentrated, at, the, centrosomal, region, and, do, not, form, golgi, ribbons, organization, of, the, plant, golgi, depends, on, actin, cables, and, not, microtubules, the, common, feature, among, golgi, is, that, they, are, adjacent, to, endoplasmic, reticulum, er, exit, sites, in, most, eukaryotes, the, golgi, apparatus, is, made, up, of, a, series, of, compartments, and, is, a, collection, of, fused, flattened, membrane, enclosed, disks, known, as, cisternae, singular, cisterna, also, called, dictyosomes, originating, from, vesicular, clusters, that, bud, off, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, a, mammalian, cell, typically, contains, 40, to, 100, stacks, of, cisternae, between, four, and, eight, cisternae, are, usually, present, in, a, stack, however, in, some, protists, as, many, as, sixty, cisternae, have, been, observed, this, collection, of, cisternae, is, broken, down, into, cis, medial, and, trans, compartments, making, up, two, main, networks, the, cis, golgi, network, cgn, and, the, trans, golgi, network, tgn, the, cgn, is, the, first, cisternal, structure, and, the, tgn, is, the, final, from, which, proteins, are, packaged, into, vesicles, destined, to, lysosomes, secretory, vesicles, or, the, cell, surface, the, tgn, is, usually, positioned, adjacent, to, the, stack, but, can, also, be, separate, from, it, the, tgn, may, act, as, an, early, endosome, in, yeast, and, plants, there, are, structural, and, organizational, differences, in, the, golgi, apparatus, among, eukaryotes, in, some, yeasts, golgi, stacking, is, not, observed, pichia, pastoris, does, have, stacked, golgi, while, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, does, not, in, plants, the, individual, stacks, of, the, golgi, apparatus, seem, to, operate, independently, the, golgi, apparatus, tends, to, be, larger, and, more, numerous, in, cells, that, synthesize, and, secrete, large, amounts, of, substances, for, example, the, antibody, secreting, plasma, b, cells, of, the, immune, system, have, prominent, golgi, complexes, in, all, eukaryotes, each, cisternal, stack, has, a, cis, entry, face, and, a, trans, exit, face, these, faces, are, characterized, by, unique, morphology, and, biochemistry, within, individual, stacks, are, assortments, of, enzymes, responsible, for, selectively, modifying, protein, cargo, these, modifications, influence, the, fate, of, the, protein, the, compartmentalization, of, the, golgi, apparatus, is, advantageous, for, separating, enzymes, thereby, maintaining, consecutive, and, selective, processing, steps, enzymes, catalyzing, early, modifications, are, gathered, in, the, cis, face, cisternae, and, enzymes, catalyzing, later, modifications, are, found, in, trans, face, cisternae, of, the, golgi, stacks, the, golgi, apparatus, is, a, major, collection, and, dispatch, station, of, protein, products, received, from, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, er, proteins, synthesized, in, the, er, are, packaged, into, vesicles, which, then, fuse, with, the, golgi, apparatus, these, cargo, proteins, are, modified, and, destined, for, secretion, via, exocytosis, or, for, use, in, the, cell, in, this, respect, the, golgi, can, be, thought, of, as, similar, to, a, post, office, it, packages, and, labels, items, which, it, then, sends, to, different, parts, of, the, cell, or, to, the, extracellular, space, the, golgi, apparatus, is, also, involved, in, lipid, transport, and, lysosome, formation, the, structure, and, function, of, the, golgi, apparatus, are, intimately, linked, individual, stacks, have, different, assortments, of, enzymes, allowing, for, progressive, processing, of, cargo, proteins, as, they, travel, from, the, cisternae, to, the, trans, golgi, face, enzymatic, reactions, within, the, golgi, stacks, occur, exclusively, near, its, membrane, surfaces, where, enzymes, are, anchored, this, feature, is, in, contrast, to, the, er, which, has, soluble, proteins, and, enzymes, in, its, lumen, much, of, the, enzymatic, processing, is, post, translational, modification, of, proteins, for, example, phosphorylation, of, oligosaccharides, on, lysosomal, proteins, occurs, in, the, early, cgn, cis, cisterna, are, associated, with, the, removal, of, mannose, residues, removal, of, mannose, residues, and, addition, of, n, acetylglucosamine, occur, in, medial, cisternae, addition, of, galactose, and, sialic, acid, occurs, in, the, trans, cisternae, sulfation, of, tyrosines, and, carbohydrates, occurs, within, the, tgn, other, general, post, translational, modifications, of, proteins, include, the, addition, of, carbohydrates, glycosylation, and, phosphates, phosphorylation, protein, modifications, may, form, a, signal, sequence, that, determines, the, final, destination, of, the, protein, for, example, the, golgi, apparatus, adds, a, mannose, 6, phosphate, label, to, proteins, destined, for, lysosomes, another, important, function, of, the, golgi, apparatus, is, in, the, formation, of, proteoglycans, enzymes, in, the, golgi, append, proteins, to, glycosaminoglycans, thus, creating, proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, are, long, unbranched, polysaccharide, molecules, present, in, the, extracellular, matrix, of, animals, the, vesicles, that, leave, the, rough, endoplasmic, reticulum, are, transported, to, the, cis, face, of, the, golgi, apparatus, where, they, fuse, with, the, golgi, membrane, and, empty, their, contents, into, the, lumen, once, inside, the, lumen, the, molecules, are, modified, then, sorted, for, transport, to, their, next, destinations, those, proteins, destined, for, areas, of, the, cell, other, than, either, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, or, the, golgi, apparatus, are, moved, through, the, golgi, cisternae, towards, the, trans, face, to, a, complex, network, of, membranes, and, associated, vesicles, known, as, the, trans, golgi, network, tgn, this, area, of, the, golgi, is, the, point, at, which, proteins, are, sorted, and, shipped, to, their, intended, destinations, by, their, placement, into, one, of, at, least, three, different, types, of, vesicles, depending, upon, the, signal, sequence, they, carry, though, there, are, multiple, models, that, attempt, to, explain, vesicular, traffic, throughout, the, golgi, no, individual, model, can, independently, explain, all, observations, of, the, golgi, apparatus, currently, the, cisternal, progression, maturation, model, is, the, most, accepted, among, scientists, accommodating, many, observations, across, eukaryotes, the, other, models, are, still, important, in, framing, questions, and, guiding, future, experimentation, among, the, fundamental, unanswered, questions, are, the, directionality, of, copi, vesicles, and, role, of, rab, gtpases, in, modulating, protein, cargo, traffic, brefeldin, a, bfa, is, a, fungal, metabolite, used, experimentally, to, disrupt, the, secretion, pathway, as, a, method, of, testing, golgi, function, bfa, blocks, the, activation, of, some, adp, ribosylation, factors, arfs, arfs, are, small, gtpases, which, regulate, vesicular, trafficking, through, the, binding, of, cops, to, endosomes, and, the, golgi, bfa, inhibits, the, function, of, several, guanine, nucleotide, exchange, factors, gefs, that, mediate, gtp, binding, of, arfs, treatment, of, cells, with, bfa, thus, disrupts, the, secretion, pathway, promoting, disassembly, of, the, golgi, apparatus, and, distributing, golgi, proteins, to, the, endosomes, and, er
