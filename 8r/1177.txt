archaea, r, k, i, ar, kee, sg, archaeon, r, k, i, n, ar, kee, on, is, a, domain, of, single, celled, organisms, these, microorganisms, lack, cell, nuclei, and, are, therefore, prokaryotic, archaea, were, initially, classified, as, bacteria, receiving, the, name, archaebacteria, r, k, i, b, k, t, r, i, in, the, archaebacteria, kingdom, but, this, term, has, fallen, out, of, use, archaeal, cells, have, unique, properties, separating, them, from, the, other, two, domains, bacteria, and, eukaryota, archaea, are, further, divided, into, multiple, recognized, phyla, classification, is, difficult, because, most, have, not, been, isolated, in, a, laboratory, and, have, been, detected, only, by, their, gene, sequences, in, environmental, samples, it, is, unknown, if, they, are, able, to, produce, endospores, archaea, and, bacteria, are, generally, similar, in, size, and, shape, although, a, few, archaea, have, very, different, shapes, such, as, the, flat, square, cells, of, haloquadratum, walsbyi, despite, this, morphological, similarity, to, bacteria, archaea, possess, genes, and, several, metabolic, pathways, that, are, more, closely, related, to, those, of, eukaryotes, notably, for, the, enzymes, involved, in, transcription, and, translation, other, aspects, of, archaeal, biochemistry, are, unique, such, as, their, reliance, on, ether, lipids, in, their, cell, membranes, including, archaeols, archaea, use, more, diverse, energy, sources, than, eukaryotes, ranging, from, organic, compounds, such, as, sugars, to, ammonia, metal, ions, or, even, hydrogen, gas, the, salt, tolerant, haloarchaea, use, sunlight, as, an, energy, source, and, other, species, of, archaea, fix, carbon, autotrophy, but, unlike, plants, and, cyanobacteria, no, known, species, of, archaea, does, both, archaea, reproduce, asexually, by, binary, fission, fragmentation, or, budding, unlike, bacteria, no, known, species, of, archaea, form, endospores, the, first, observed, archaea, were, extremophiles, living, in, extreme, environments, such, as, hot, springs, and, salt, lakes, with, no, other, organisms, improved, molecular, detection, tools, led, to, the, discovery, of, archaea, in, almost, every, habitat, including, soil, oceans, and, marshlands, archaea, are, particularly, numerous, in, the, oceans, and, the, archaea, in, plankton, may, be, one, of, the, most, abundant, groups, of, organisms, on, the, planet, archaea, are, a, major, part, of, earth, s, life, they, are, part, of, the, microbiota, of, all, organisms, in, the, human, microbiome, they, are, important, in, the, gut, mouth, and, on, the, skin, their, morphological, metabolic, and, geographical, diversity, permits, them, to, play, multiple, ecological, roles, carbon, fixation, nitrogen, cycling, organic, compound, turnover, and, maintaining, microbial, symbiotic, and, syntrophic, communities, for, example, no, clear, examples, of, archaeal, pathogens, or, parasites, are, known, instead, they, are, often, mutualists, or, commensals, such, as, the, methanogens, methane, producing, strains, that, inhabit, the, gastrointestinal, tract, in, humans, and, ruminants, where, their, vast, numbers, facilitate, digestion, methanogens, are, also, used, in, biogas, production, and, sewage, treatment, and, biotechnology, exploits, enzymes, from, extremophile, archaea, that, can, endure, high, temperatures, and, organic, solvents, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, prokaryotes, were, regarded, as, a, single, group, of, organisms, and, classified, based, on, their, biochemistry, morphology, and, metabolism, microbiologists, tried, to, classify, microorganisms, based, on, the, structures, of, their, cell, walls, their, shapes, and, the, substances, they, consume, in, 1965, emile, zuckerkandl, and, linus, pauling, instead, proposed, using, the, sequences, of, the, genes, in, different, prokaryotes, to, work, out, how, they, are, related, to, each, other, this, phylogenetic, approach, is, the, main, method, used, today, archaea, were, first, classified, separately, from, bacteria, in, 1977, by, carl, woese, and, george, e, fox, based, on, their, ribosomal, rna, rrna, genes, at, that, time, only, the, methanogens, were, known, they, called, these, groups, the, urkingdoms, of, archaebacteria, and, eubacteria, though, other, researchers, treated, them, as, kingdoms, or, subkingdoms, woese, and, fox, gave, the, first, evidence, for, archaebacteria, as, a, separate, line, of, descent, 1, lack, of, peptidoglycan, in, their, cell, walls, 2, two, unusual, coenzymes, 3, results, of, 16s, ribosomal, rna, gene, sequencing, to, emphasize, this, difference, woese, otto, kandler, and, mark, wheelis, later, proposed, reclassifying, organisms, into, three, natural, domains, known, as, the, three, domain, system, the, eukarya, the, bacteria, and, the, archaea, in, what, is, now, known, as, the, woesian, revolution, the, word, archaea, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, meaning, ancient, things, as, the, first, representatives, of, the, domain, archaea, were, methanogens, and, it, was, assumed, that, their, metabolism, reflected, earth, s, primitive, atmosphere, and, the, organisms, antiquity, but, as, new, habitats, were, studied, more, organisms, were, discovered, extreme, halophilic, and, hyperthermophilic, microbes, were, also, included, in, archaea, for, a, long, time, archaea, were, seen, as, extremophiles, that, exist, only, in, extreme, habitats, such, as, hot, springs, and, salt, lakes, but, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, archaea, had, been, identified, in, non, extreme, environments, as, well, today, they, are, known, to, be, a, large, and, diverse, group, of, organisms, abundantly, distributed, throughout, nature, this, new, appreciation, of, the, importance, and, ubiquity, of, archaea, came, from, using, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, to, detect, prokaryotes, from, environmental, samples, such, as, water, or, soil, by, multiplying, their, ribosomal, genes, this, allows, the, detection, and, identification, of, organisms, that, have, not, been, cultured, in, the, laboratory, the, classification, of, archaea, and, of, prokaryotes, in, general, is, a, rapidly, moving, and, contentious, field, current, classification, systems, aim, to, organize, archaea, into, groups, of, organisms, that, share, structural, features, and, common, ancestors, these, classifications, rely, heavily, on, the, use, of, the, sequence, of, ribosomal, rna, genes, to, reveal, relationships, among, organisms, molecular, phylogenetics, most, of, the, culturable, and, well, investigated, species, of, archaea, are, members, of, two, main, phyla, the, euryarchaeota, and, the, thermoproteota, formerly, crenarchaeota, other, groups, have, been, tentatively, created, such, as, the, peculiar, species, nanoarchaeum, equitans, discovered, in, 2003, and, assigned, its, own, phylum, the, nanoarchaeota, a, new, phylum, korarchaeota, has, also, been, proposed, containing, a, small, group, of, unusual, thermophilic, species, sharing, features, of, both, the, main, phyla, but, most, closely, related, to, the, thermoproteota, other, detected, species, of, archaea, are, only, distantly, related, to, any, of, these, groups, such, as, the, archaeal, richmond, mine, acidophilic, nanoorganisms, arman, comprising, micrarchaeota, and, parvarchaeota, which, were, discovered, in, 2006, and, are, some, of, the, smallest, organisms, known, a, superphylum, tack, which, includes, the, thaumarchaeota, now, nitrososphaerota, aigarchaeota, crenarchaeota, now, thermoproteota, and, korarchaeota, was, proposed, in, 2011, to, be, related, to, the, origin, of, eukaryotes, in, 2017, the, newly, discovered, and, newly, named, asgard, superphylum, was, proposed, to, be, more, closely, related, to, the, original, eukaryote, and, a, sister, group, to, tack, in, 2013, the, superphylum, dpann, was, proposed, to, group, nanoarchaeota, nanohaloarchaeota, archaeal, richmond, mine, acidophilic, nanoorganisms, arman, comprising, micrarchaeota, and, parvarchaeota, and, other, similar, archaea, this, archaeal, superphylum, encompasses, at, least, 10, different, lineages, and, includes, organisms, with, extremely, small, cell, and, genome, sizes, and, limited, metabolic, capabilities, therefore, dpann, may, include, members, obligately, dependent, on, symbiotic, interactions, and, may, even, include, novel, parasites, however, other, phylogenetic, analyses, found, that, dpann, does, not, form, a, monophyletic, group, and, that, the, apparent, grouping, is, caused, by, long, branch, attraction, lba, suggesting, that, all, these, lineages, belong, to, euryarchaeota, according, to, tom, a,

organisms, does, not, apply, as, archaea, reproduce, only, asexually, archaea, show, high, levels, of, horizontal, gene, transfer, between, lineages, some, researchers, suggest, that, individuals, can, be, grouped, into, species, like, populations, given, highly, similar, genomes, and, infrequent, gene, transfer, to, from, cells, with, less, related, genomes, as, in, the, genus, ferroplasma, on, the, other, hand, studies, in, halorubrum, found, significant, genetic, transfer, to, from, less, related, populations, limiting, the, criterion, s, applicability, some, researchers, question, whether, such, species, designations, have, practical, meaning, current, knowledge, on, genetic, diversity, in, archaeans, is, fragmentary, so, the, total, number, of, species, cannot, be, estimated, with, any, accuracy, estimates, of, the, number, of, phyla, range, from, 18, to, 23, of, which, only, 8, have, representatives, that, have, been, cultured, and, studied, directly, many, of, these, hypothesized, groups, are, known, from, a, single, rrna, sequence, so, the, level, of, diversity, remains, obscure, this, situation, is, also, seen, in, the, bacteria, many, uncultured, microbes, present, similar, issues, with, characterization, the, following, phyla, have, been, validly, published, according, to, the, bacteriological, code, the, following, phyla, have, been, proposed, but, have, not, been, validly, published, according, to, the, bacteriological, code, including, those, that, have, candidatus, status, the, age, of, the, earth, is, about, 4, 54, billion, years, scientific, evidence, suggests, that, life, began, on, earth, at, least, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, the, earliest, evidence, for, life, on, earth, is, graphite, found, to, be, biogenic, in, 3, 7, billion, year, old, metasedimentary, rocks, discovered, in, western, greenland, and, microbial, mat, fossils, found, in, 3, 48, billion, year, old, sandstone, discovered, in, western, australia, in, 2015, possible, remains, of, biotic, matter, were, found, in, 4, 1, billion, year, old, rocks, in, western, australia, although, probable, prokaryotic, cell, fossils, date, to, almost, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, most, prokaryotes, do, not, have, distinctive, morphologies, and, fossil, shapes, cannot, be, used, to, identify, them, as, archaea, instead, chemical, fossils, of, unique, lipids, are, more, informative, because, such, compounds, do, not, occur, in, other, organisms, some, publications, suggest, that, archaeal, or, eukaryotic, lipid, remains, are, present, in, shales, dating, from, 2, 7, billion, years, ago, though, such, data, have, since, been, questioned, these, lipids, have, also, been, detected, in, even, older, rocks, from, west, greenland, the, oldest, such, traces, come, from, the, isua, district, which, includes, earth, s, oldest, known, sediments, formed, 3, 8, billion, years, ago, the, archaeal, lineage, may, be, the, most, ancient, that, exists, on, earth, woese, argued, that, the, bacteria, archaea, and, eukaryotes, represent, separate, lines, of, descent, that, diverged, early, on, from, an, ancestral, colony, of, organisms, one, possibility, is, that, this, occurred, before, the, evolution, of, cells, when, the, lack, of, a, typical, cell, membrane, allowed, unrestricted, lateral, gene, transfer, and, that, the, common, ancestors, of, the, three, domains, arose, by, fixation, of, specific, subsets, of, genes, it, is, possible, that, the, last, common, ancestor, of, bacteria, and, archaea, was, a, thermophile, which, raises, the, possibility, that, lower, temperatures, are, extreme, environments, for, archaea, and, organisms, that, live, in, cooler, environments, appeared, only, later, since, archaea, and, bacteria, are, no, more, related, to, each, other, than, they, are, to, eukaryotes, the, term, prokaryote, may, suggest, a, false, similarity, between, them, however, structural, and, functional, similarities, between, lineages, often, occur, because, of, shared, ancestral, traits, or, evolutionary, convergence, these, similarities, are, known, as, a, grade, and, prokaryotes, are, best, thought, of, as, a, grade, of, life, characterized, by, such, features, as, an, absence, of, membrane, bound, organelles, the, following, table, compares, some, major, characteristics, of, the, three, domains, to, illustrate, their, similarities, and, differences, archaea, were, split, off, as, a, third, domain, because, of, the, large, differences, in, their, ribosomal, rna, structure, the, particular, molecule, 16s, rrna, is, key, to, the, production, of, proteins, in, all, organisms, because, this, function, is, so, central, to, life, organisms, with, mutations, in, their, 16s, rrna, are, unlikely, to, survive, leading, to, great, but, not, absolute, stability, in, the, structure, of, this, polynucleotide, over, generations, 16s, rrna, is, large, enough, to, show, organism, specific, variations, but, still, small, enough, to, be, compared, quickly, in, 1977, carl, woese, a, microbiologist, studying, the, genetic, sequences, of, organisms, developed, a, new, comparison, method, that, involved, splitting, the, rna, into, fragments, that, could, be, sorted, and, compared, with, other, fragments, from, other, organisms, the, more, similar, the, patterns, between, species, the, more, closely, they, are, related, woese, used, his, new, rrna, comparison, method, to, categorize, and, contrast, different, organisms, he, compared, a, variety, of, species, and, happened, upon, a, group, of, methanogens, with, rrna, vastly, different, from, any, known, prokaryotes, or, eukaryotes, these, methanogens, were, much, more, similar, to, each, other, than, to, other, organisms, leading, woese, to, propose, the, new, domain, of, archaea, his, experiments, showed, that, the, archaea, were, genetically, more, similar, to, eukaryotes, than, prokaryotes, even, though, they, were, more, similar, to, prokaryotes, in, structure, this, led, to, the, conclusion, that, archaea, and, eukarya, shared, a, common, ancestor, more, recent, than, eukarya, and, bacteria, the, development, of, the, nucleus, occurred, after, the, split, between, bacteria, and, this, common, ancestor, one, property, unique, to, archaea, is, the, abundant, use, of, ether, linked, lipids, in, their, cell, membranes, ether, linkages, are, more, chemically, stable, than, the, ester, linkages, found, in, bacteria, and, eukarya, which, may, be, a, contributing, factor, to, the, ability, of, many, archaea, to, survive, in, extreme, environments, that, place, heavy, stress, on, cell, membranes, such, as, extreme, heat, and, salinity, comparative, analysis, of, archaeal, genomes, has, also, identified, several, molecular, conserved, signature, indels, and, signature, proteins, uniquely, present, in, either, all, archaea, or, different, main, groups, within, archaea, another, unique, feature, of, archaea, found, in, no, other, organisms, is, methanogenesis, the, metabolic, production, of, methane, methanogenic, archaea, play, a, pivotal, role, in, ecosystems, with, organisms, that, derive, energy, from, oxidation, of, methane, many, of, which, are, bacteria, as, they, are, often, a, major, source, of, methane, in, such, environments, and, can, play, a, role, as, primary, producers, methanogens, also, play, a, critical, role, in, the, carbon, cycle, breaking, down, organic, carbon, into, methane, which, is, also, a, major, greenhouse, gas, this, difference, in, the, biochemical, structure, of, bacteria, and, archaea, has, been, explained, by, researchers, through, evolutionary, processes, it, is, theorized, that, both, domains, originated, at, deep, sea, alkaline, hydrothermal, vents, at, least, twice, microbes, evolved, lipid, biosynthesis, and, cell, wall, biochemistry, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, last, universal, common, ancestor, was, a, non, free, living, organism, it, may, have, had, a, permeable, membrane, composed, of, bacterial, simple, chain, amphiphiles, fatty, acids, including, archaeal, simple, chain, amphiphiles, isoprenoids, these, stabilize, fatty, acid, membranes, in, seawater, this, property, may, have, driven, the, divergence, of, bacterial, and, archaeal, membranes, with, the, later, biosynthesis, of, phospholipids, giving, rise, to, the, unique, g1p, and, g3p, headgroups, of, archaea, and, bacteria, respectively, if, so, the, properties, conferred, by, membrane, isoprenoids, place, the, lipid, divide, as, early, as, the, origin, of, life, the, relationships, among, the, three, domains, are, of, central, importance, for, understanding, the, origin, of, life, most, of, the, metabolic, pathways, which, are, the, object, of, the, majority, of, an, organism, s, genes, are, common, between, archaea, and, bacteria, while, most, genes, involved, in, genome, expression, are, common, between, archaea, and, eukarya, within, prokaryotes, archaeal, cell, structure, is, most, similar, to, that, of, gram, positive, bacteria, largely, because, both, have, a, single, lipid, bilayer, and, usually, contain, a, thick, sacculus, exoskeleton, of, varying, chemical, composition, in, some, phylogenetic, trees, based, upon, different, gene, protein, sequences, of, prokaryotic, homologs, the, archaeal, homologs, are, more, closely, related, to, those, of, gram, positive, bacteria, archaea, and, gram, positive, bacteria, also, share, conserved, indels, in, a, number, of, important, proteins, such, as, hsp70, and, glutamine, synthetase, i, but, the, phylogeny, of, these, genes, was, interpreted, to, reveal, interdomain, gene, transfer, and, might, not, reflect, the, organismal, relationship, s, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, archaea, evolved, from, gram, positive, bacteria, in, response, to, antibiotic, selection, pressure, this, is, suggested, by, the, observation, that, archaea, are, resistant, to, a, wide, variety, of, antibiotics, that, are, produced, primarily, by, gram, positive, bacteria, and, that, these, antibiotics, act, primarily, on, the, genes, that, distinguish, archaea, from, bacteria, the, proposal, is, that, the, selective, pressure, towards, resistance, generated, by, the, gram, positive, antibiotics, was, eventually, sufficient, to, cause, extensive, changes, in, many, of, the, antibiotics, target, genes, and, that, these, strains, represented, the, common, ancestors, of, present, day, archaea, the, evolution, of, archaea, in, response, to, antibiotic, selection, or, any, other, competitive, selective, pressure, could, also, explain, their, adaptation, to, extreme, environments, such, as, high, temperature, or, acidity, as, the, result, of, a, search, for, unoccupied, niches, to, escape, from, antibiotic, producing, organisms, cavalier, smith, has, made, a, similar, suggestion, the, neomura, hypothesis, this, proposal, is, also, supported, by, other, work, investigating, protein, structural, relationships, and, studies, that, suggest, that, gram, positive, bacteria, may, constitute, the, earliest, branching, lineages, within, the, prokaryotes, the, evolutionary, relationship, between, archaea, and, eukaryotes, remains, unclear, aside, from, the, similarities, in, cell, structure, and, function, that, are, discussed, below, many, genetic, trees, group, the, two, complicating, factors, include, claims, that, the, relationship, between, eukaryotes, and, the, archaeal, phylum, thermoproteota, is, closer, than, the, relationship, between, the, euryarchaeota, and, the, phylum, thermoproteota, and, the, presence, of, archaea, like, genes, in, certain, bacteria, such, as, thermotoga, maritima, from, horizontal, gene, transfer, the, standard, hypothesis, states, that, the, ancestor, of, the, eukaryotes, diverged, early, from, the, archaea, and, that, eukaryotes, arose, through, symbiogenesis, the, fusion, of, an, archaean, and, a, eubacterium, which, formed, the, mitochondria, this, hypothesis, explains, the, genetic, similarities, between, the, groups, the, eocyte, hypothesis, instead, posits, that, eukaryota, emerged, relatively, late, from, the, archaea, a, lineage, of, archaea, discovered, in, 2015, lokiarchaeum, of, the, proposed, new, phylum, lokiarchaeota, named, for, a, hydrothermal, vent, called, loki, s, castle, in, the, arctic, ocean, was, found, to, be, the, most, closely, related, to, eukaryotes, known, at, that, time, it, has, been, called, a, transitional, organism, between, prokaryotes, and, eukaryotes, several, sister, phyla, of, lokiarchaeota, have, since, been, found, thorarchaeota, odinarchaeota, heimdallarchaeota, all, together, comprising, a, newly, proposed, supergroup, asgard, details, of, the, relation, of, asgard, members, and, eukaryotes, are, still, under, consideration, although, in, january, 2020, scientists, reported, that, candidatus, prometheoarchaeum, syntrophicum, a, type, of, asgard, archaea, may, be, a, possible, link, between, simple, prokaryotic, and, complex, eukaryotic, microorganisms, about, two, billion, years, ago, individual, archaea, range, from, 0, 1, micrometers, m, to, over, 15, m, in, diameter, and, occur, in, various, shapes, commonly, as, spheres, rods, spirals, or, plates, other, morphologies, in, the, thermoproteota, include, irregularly, shaped, lobed, cells, in, sulfolobus, needle, like, filaments, that, are, less, than, half, a, micrometer, in, diameter, in, thermofilum, and, almost, perfectly, rectangular, rods, in, thermoproteus, and, pyrobaculum, archaea, in, the, genus, haloquadratum, such, as, haloquadratum, walsbyi, are, flat, square, specimens, that, live, in, hypersaline, pools, these, unusual, shapes, are, probably, maintained, by, both, their, cell, walls, and, a, prokaryotic, cytoskeleton, proteins, related, to, the, cytoskeleton, components, of, other, organisms, exist, in, archaea, and, filaments, form, within, their, cells, but, in, contrast, with, other, organisms, these, cellular, structures, are, poorly, understood, in, thermoplasma, and, ferroplasma, the, lack, of, a, cell, wall, means, that, the, cells, have, irregular, shapes, and, can, resemble, amoebae, some, species, form, aggregates, or, filaments, of, cells, up, to, 200, m, long, these, organisms, can, be, prominent, in, biofilms, notably, aggregates, of, thermococcus, coalescens, cells, fuse, together, in, culture, forming, single, giant, cells, archaea, in, the, genus, pyrodictium, produce, an, elaborate, multicell, colony, involving, arrays, of, long, thin, hollow, tubes, called, cannulae, that, stick, out, from, the, cells, surfaces, and, connect, them, into, a, dense, bush, like, agglomeration, the, function, of, these, cannulae, is, not, settled, but, they, may, allow, communication, or, nutrient, exchange, with, neighbors, multi, species, colonies, exist, such, as, the, string, of, pearls, community, that, was, discovered, in, 2001, in, a, german, swamp, round, whitish, colonies, of, a, novel, euryarchaeota, species, are, spaced, along, thin, filaments, that, can, range, up, to, 15, centimetres, 5, 9, in, long, these, filaments, are, made, of, a, particular, bacteria, species, archaea, and, bacteria, have, generally, similar, cell, structure, but, cell, composition, and, organization, set, the, archaea, apart, like, bacteria, archaea, lack, interior, membranes, and, organelles, like, bacteria, the, cell, membranes, of, archaea, are, usually, bounded, by, a, cell, wall, and, they, swim, using, one, or, more, flagella, structurally, archaea, are, most, similar, to, gram, positive, bacteria, most, have, a, single, plasma, membrane, and, cell, wall, and, lack, a, periplasmic, space, the, exception, to, this, general, rule, is, ignicoccus, which, possess, a, particularly, large, periplasm, that, contains, membrane, bound, vesicles, and, is, enclosed, by, an, outer, membrane, most, archaea, but, not, thermoplasma, and, ferroplasma, possess, a, cell, wall, in, most, archaea, the, wall, is, assembled, from, surface, layer, proteins, which, form, an, s, layer, an, s, layer, is, a, rigid, array, of, protein, molecules, that, cover, the, outside, of, the, cell, like, chain, mail, this, layer, provides, both, chemical, and, physical, protection, and, can, prevent, macromolecules, from, contacting, the, cell, membrane, unlike, bacteria, archaea, lack, peptidoglycan, in, their, cell, walls, methanobacteriales, do, have, cell, walls, containing, pseudopeptidoglycan, which, resembles, eubacterial, peptidoglycan, in, morphology, function, and, physical, structure, but, pseudopeptidoglycan, is, distinct, in, chemical, structure, it, lacks, d, amino, acids, and, n, acetylmuramic, acid, substituting, the, latter, with, n, acetyltalosaminuronic, acid, archaeal, flagella, are, known, as, archaella, that, operate, like, bacterial, flagella, their, long, stalks, are, driven, by, rotatory, motors, at, the, base, these, motors, are, powered, by, a, proton, gradient, across, the, membrane, but, archaella, are, notably, different, in, composition, and, development, the, two, types, of, flagella, evolved, from, different, ancestors, the, bacterial, flagellum, shares, a, common, ancestor, with, the, type, iii, secretion, system, while, archaeal, flagella, appear, to, have, evolved, from, bacterial, type, iv, pili, in, contrast, with, the, bacterial, flagellum, which, is, hollow, and, assembled, by, subunits, moving, up, the, central, pore, to, the, tip, of, the, flagella, archaeal, flagella, are, synthesized, by, adding, subunits, at, the, base, archaeal, membranes, are, made, of, molecules, that, are, distinctly, different, from, those, in, all, other, life, forms, showing, that, archaea, are, related, only, distantly, to, bacteria, and, eukaryotes, in, all, organisms, cell, membranes, are, made, of, molecules, known, as, phospholipids, these, molecules, possess, both, a, polar, part, that, dissolves, in, water, the, phosphate, head, and, a, greasy, non, polar, part, that, does, not, the, lipid, tail, these, dissimilar, parts, are, connected, by, a, glycerol, moiety, in, water, phospholipids, cluster, with, the, heads, facing, the, water, and, the, tails, facing, away, from, it, the, major, structure, in, cell, membranes, is, a, double, layer, of, these, phospholipids, which, is, called, a, lipid, bilayer, the, phospholipids, of, archaea, are, unusual, in, four, ways, archaea, exhibit, a, great, variety, of, chemical, reactions, in, their, metabolism, and, use, many, sources, of, energy, these, reactions, are, classified, into, nutritional, groups, depending, on, energy, and, carbon, sources, some, archaea, obtain, energy, from, inorganic, compounds, such, as, sulfur, or, ammonia, they, are, chemotrophs, these, include, nitrifiers, methanogens, and, anaerobic, methane, oxidisers, in, these, reactions, one, compound, passes, electrons, to, another, in, a, redox, reaction, releasing, energy, to, fuel, the, cell, s, activities, one, compound, acts, as, an, electron, donor, and, one, as, an, electron, acceptor, the, energy, released, is, used, to, generate, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, through, chemiosmosis, the, same, basic, process, that, happens, in, the, mitochondrion, of, eukaryotic, cells, other, groups, of, archaea, use, sunlight, as, a, source, of, energy, they, are, phototrophs, but, oxygen, generating, photosynthesis, does, not, occur, in, any, of, these, organisms, many, basic, metabolic, pathways, are, shared, among, all, forms, of, life, for, example, archaea, use, a, modified, form, of, glycolysis, the, entner, doudoroff, pathway, and, either, a, complete, or, partial, citric, acid, cycle, these, similarities, to, other, organisms, probably, reflect, both, early, origins, in, the, history, of, life, and, their, high, level, of, efficiency, some, euryarchaeota, are, methanogens, archaea, that, produce, methane, as, a, result, of, metabolism, living, in, anaerobic, environments, such, as, swamps, this, form, of, metabolism, evolved, early, and, it, is, even, possible, that, the, first, free, living, organism, was, a, methanogen, a, common, reaction, involves, the, use, of, carbon, dioxide, as, an, electron, acceptor, to, oxidize, hydrogen, methanogenesis, involves, a, range, of, coenzymes, that, are, unique, to, these, archaea, such, as, coenzyme, m, and, methanofuran, other, organic, compounds, such, as, alcohols, acetic, acid, or, formic, acid, are, used, as, alternative, electron, acceptors, by, methanogens, these, reactions, are, common, in, gut, dwelling, archaea, acetic, acid, is, also, broken, down, into, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, directly, by, acetotrophic, archaea, these, acetotrophs, are, archaea, in, the, order, methanosarcinales, and, are, a, major, part, of, the, communities, of, microorganisms, that, produce, biogas, other, archaea, use, co, 2, in, the, atmosphere, as, a, source, of, carbon, in, a, process, called, carbon, fixation, they, are, autotrophs, this, process, involves, either, a, highly, modified, form, of, the, calvin, cycle, or, another, metabolic, pathway, called, the, 3, hydroxypropionate, 4, hydroxybutyrate, cycle, the, thermoproteota, also, use, the, reverse, krebs, cycle, while, the, euryarchaeota, also, use, the, reductive, acetyl, coa, pathway, carbon, fixation, is, powered, by, inorganic, energy, sources, no, known, archaea, carry, out, photosynthesis, halobacterium, is, the, only, known, phototroph, archeon, but, it, uses, an, alternative, process, to, photosynthesis, archaeal, energy, sources, are, extremely, diverse, and, range, from, the, oxidation, of, ammonia, by, the, nitrosopumilales, to, the, oxidation, of, hydrogen, sulfide, or, elemental, sulfur, by, species, of, sulfolobus, using, either, oxygen, or, metal, ions, as, electron, acceptors, phototrophic, archaea, use, light, to, produce, chemical, energy, in, the, form, of, atp, in, the, halobacteria, light, activated, ion, pumps, like, bacteriorhodopsin, and, halorhodopsin, generate, ion, gradients, by, pumping, ions, out, of, and, into, the, cell, across, the, plasma, membrane, the, energy, stored, in, these, electrochemical, gradients, is, then, converted, into, atp, by, atp, synthase, this, process, is, a, form, of, photophosphorylation, the, ability, of, these, light, driven, pumps, to, move, ions, across, membranes, depends, on, light, driven, changes, in, the, structure, of, a, retinol, cofactor, buried, in, the, center, of, the, protein, archaea, usually, have, a, single, circular, chromosome, but, many, euryarchaea, have, been, shown, to, bear, multiple, copies, of, this, chromosome, the, largest, known, archaeal, genome, as, of, 2002, was, 5, 751, 492, base, pairs, in, methanosarcina, acetivorans, the, tiny, 490, 885, base, pair, genome, of, nanoarchaeum, equitans, is, one, tenth, of, this, size, and, the, smallest, archaeal, genome, known, it, is, estimated, to, contain, only, 537, protein, encoding, genes, smaller, independent, pieces, of, dna, called, plasmids, are, also, found, in, archaea, plasmids, may, be, transferred, between, cells, by, physical, contact, in, a, process, that, may, be, similar, to, bacterial, conjugation, archaea, are, genetically, distinct, from, bacteria, and, eukaryotes, with, up, to, 15, of, the, proteins, encoded, by, any, one, archaeal, genome, being, unique, to, the, domain, although, most, of, these, unique, genes, have, no, known, function, of, the, remainder, of, the, unique, proteins, that, have, an, identified, function, most, belong, to, the, euryarchaeota, and, are, involved, in, methanogenesis, the, proteins, that, archaea, bacteria, and, eukaryotes, share, form, a, common, core, of, cell, function, relating, mostly, to, transcription, translation, and, nucleotide, metabolism, other, characteristic, archaeal, features, are, the, organization, of, genes, of, related, function, such, as, enzymes, that, catalyze, steps, in, the, same, metabolic, pathway, into, novel, operons, and, large, differences, in, trna, genes, and, their, aminoacyl, trna, synthetases, transcription, in, archaea, more, closely, resembles, eukaryotic, than, bacterial, transcription, with, the, archaeal, rna, polymerase, being, very, close, to, its, equivalent, in, eukaryotes, while, archaeal, translation, shows, signs, of, both, bacterial, and, eukaryotic, equivalents, although, archaea, have, only, one, type, of, rna, polymerase, its, structure, and, function, in, transcription, seems, to, be, close, to, that, of, the, eukaryotic, rna, polymerase, ii, with, similar, protein, assemblies, the, general, transcription, factors, directing, the, binding, of, the, rna, polymerase, to, a, gene, s, promoter, but, other, archaeal, transcription, factors, are, closer, to, those, found, in, bacteria, post, transcriptional, modification, is, simpler, than, in, eukaryotes, since, most, archaeal, genes, lack, introns, although, there, are, many, introns, in, their, transfer, rna, and, ribosomal, rna, genes, and, introns, may, occur, in, a, few, protein, encoding, genes, haloferax, volcanii, an, extreme, halophilic, archaeon, forms, cytoplasmic, bridges, between, cells, that, appear, to, be, used, for, transfer, of, dna, from, one, cell, to, another, in, either, direction, when, the, hyperthermophilic, archaea, sulfolobus, solfataricus, and, sulfolobus, acidocaldarius, are, exposed, to, dna, damaging, uv, irradiation, or, to, the, agents, bleomycin, or, mitomycin, c, species, specific, cellular, aggregation, is, induced, aggregation, in, s, solfataricus, could, not, be, induced, by, other, physical, stressors, such, as, ph, or, temperature, shift, suggesting, that, aggregation, is, induced, specifically, by, dna, damage, ajon, et, al, showed, that, uv, induced, cellular, aggregation, mediates, chromosomal, marker, exchange, with, high, frequency, in, s, acidocaldarius, recombination, rates, exceeded, those, of, uninduced, cultures, by, up, to, three, orders, of, magnitude, frols, et, al, and, ajon, et, al, hypothesized, that, cellular, aggregation, enhances, species, specific, dna, transfer, between, sulfolobus, cells, in, order, to, provide, increased, repair, of, damaged, dna, by, means, of, homologous, recombination, this, response, may, be, a, primitive, form, of, sexual, interaction, similar, to, the, more, well, studied, bacterial, transformation, systems, that, are, also, associated, with, species, specific, dna, transfer, between, cells, leading, to, homologous, recombinational, repair, of, dna, damage, archaea, are, the, target, of, a, number, of, viruses, in, a, diverse, virosphere, distinct, from, bacterial, and, eukaryotic, viruses, they, have, been, organized, into, 15, 18, dna, based, families, so, far, but, multiple, species, remain, un, isolated, and, await, classification, these, families, can, be, informally, divided, into, two, groups, archaea, specific, and, cosmopolitan, archaeal, specific, viruses, target, only, archaean, species, and, currently, include, 12, families, numerous, unique, previously, unidentified, viral, structures, have, been, observed, in, this, group, including, bottle, shaped, spindle, shaped, coil, shaped, and, droplet, shaped, viruses, while, the, reproductive, cycles, and, genomic, mechanisms, of, archaea, specific, species, may, be, similar, to, other, viruses, they, bear, unique, characteristics, that, were, specifically, developed, due, to, the, morphology, of, host, cells, they, infect, their, virus, release, mechanisms, differ, from, that, of, other, phages, bacteriophages, generally, undergo, either, lytic, pathways, lysogenic, pathways, or, rarely, a, mix, of, the, two, most, archaea, specific, viral, strains, maintain, a, stable, somewhat, lysogenic, relationship, with, their, hosts, appearing, as, a, chronic, infection, this, involves, the, gradual, and, continuous, production, and, release, of, virions, without, killing, the, host, cell, prangishyili, 2013, noted, that, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, tailed, archaeal, phages, originated, from, bacteriophages, capable, of, infecting, haloarchaeal, species, if, the, hypothesis, is, correct, it, can, be, concluded, that, other, double, stranded, dna, viruses, that, make, up, the, rest, of, the, archaea, specific, group, are, their, own, unique, group, in, the, global, viral, community, krupovic, et, al, 2018, states, that, the, high, levels, of, horizontal, gene, transfer, rapid, mutation, rates, in, viral, genomes, and, lack, of, universal, gene, sequences, have, led, researchers, to, perceive, the, evolutionary, pathway, of, archaeal, viruses, as, a, network, the, lack, of, similarities, among, phylogenetic, markers, in, this, network, and, the, global, virosphere, as, well, as, external, linkages, to, non, viral, elements, may, suggest, that, some, species, of, archaea, specific, viruses, evolved, from, non, viral, mobile, genetic, elements, mge, these, viruses, have, been, studied, in, most, detail, in, thermophilics, particularly, the, orders, sulfolobales, and, thermoproteales, two, groups, of, single, stranded, dna, viruses, that, infect, archaea, have, been, recently, isolated, one, group, is, exemplified, by, the, halorubrum, pleomorphic, virus, 1, pleolipoviridae, infecting, halophilic, archaea, and, the, other, one, by, the, aeropyrum, coil, shaped, virus, spiraviridae, infecting, a, hyperthermophilic, optimal, growth, at, 90, 95, c, host, notably, the, latter, virus, has, the, largest, currently, reported, ssdna, genome, defenses, against, these, viruses, may, involve, rna, interference, from, repetitive, dna, sequences, that, are, related, to, the, genes, of, the, viruses, archaea, reproduce, asexually, by, binary, or, multiple, fission, fragmentation, or, budding, mitosis, and, meiosis, do, not, occur, so, if, a, species, of, archaea, exists, in, more, than, one, form, all, have, the, same, genetic, material, cell, division, is, controlled, in, a, cell, cycle, after, the, cell, s, chromosome, is, replicated, and, the, two, daughter, chromosomes, separate, the, cell, divides, in, the, genus, sulfolobus, the, cycle, has, characteristics, that, are, similar, to, both, bacterial, and, eukaryotic, systems, the, chromosomes, replicate, from, multiple, starting, points, origins, of, replication, using, dna, polymerases, that, resemble, the, equivalent, eukaryotic, enzymes, in, euryarchaeota, the, cell, division, protein, ftsz, which, forms, a, contracting, ring, around, the, cell, and, the, components, of, the, septum, that, is, constructed, across, the, center, of, the, cell, are, similar, to, their, bacterial, equivalents, in, cren, and, thaumarchaea, the, cell, division, machinery, cdv, fulfills, a, similar, role, this, machinery, is, related, to, the, eukaryotic, escrt, iii, machinery, which, while, best, known, for, its, role, in, cell, sorting, also, has, been, seen, to, fulfill, a, role, in, separation, between, divided, cell, suggesting, an, ancestral, role, in, cell, division, both, bacteria, and, eukaryotes, but, not, archaea, make, spores, some, species, of, haloarchaea, undergo, phenotypic, switching, and, grow, as, several, different, cell, types, including, thick, walled, structures, that, are, resistant, to, osmotic, shock, and, allow, the, archaea, to, survive, in, water, at, low, salt, concentrations, but, these, are, not, reproductive, structures, and, may, instead, help, them, reach, new, habitats, quorum, sensing, was, originally, thought, to, not, exist, in, archaea, but, recent, studies, have, shown, evidence, of, some, species, being, able, to, perform, cross, talk, through, quorum, sensing, other, studies, have, shown, syntrophic, interactions, between, archaea, and, bacteria, during, biofilm, growth, although, research, is, limited, in, archaeal, quorum, sensing, some, studies, have, uncovered, luxr, proteins, in, archaeal, species, displaying, similarities, with, bacteria, luxr, and, ultimately, allowing, for, the, detection, of, small, molecules, that, are, used, in, high, density, communication, similarly, to, bacteria, archaea, luxr, solos, have, shown, to, bind, to, ahls, lactones, and, non, ahls, ligans, which, is, a, large, part, in, performing, intraspecies, interspecies, and, interkingdom, communication, through, quorum, sensing, archaea, exist, in, a, broad, range, of, habitats, and, are, now, recognized, as, a, major, part, of, global, ecosystems, and, may, represent, about, 20, of, microbial, cells, in, the, oceans, however, the, first, discovered, archaeans, were, extremophiles, indeed, some, archaea, survive, high, temperatures, often, above, 100, c, 212, f, as, found, in, geysers, black, smokers, and, oil, wells, other, common, habitats, include, very, cold, habitats, and, highly, saline, acidic, or, alkaline, water, but, archaea, include, mesophiles, that, grow, in, mild, conditions, in, swamps, and, marshland, sewage, the, oceans, the, intestinal, tract, of, animals, and, soils, similar, to, pgpr, archaea, are, now, considered, as, a, source, of, plant, growth, promotion, as, well, extremophile, archaea, are, members, of, four, main, physiological, groups, these, are, the, halophiles, thermophiles, alkaliphiles, and, acidophiles, these, groups, are, not, comprehensive, or, phylum, specific, nor, are, they, mutually, exclusive, since, some, archaea, belong, to, several, groups, nonetheless, they, are, a, useful, starting, point, for, classification, halophiles, including, the, genus, halobacterium, live, in, extremely, saline, environments, such, as, salt, lakes, and, outnumber, their, bacterial, counterparts, at, salinities, greater, than, 20, 25, thermophiles, grow, best, at, temperatures, above, 45, c, 113, f, in, places, such, as, hot, springs, hyperthermophilic, archaea, grow, optimally, at, temperatures, greater, than, 80, c, 176, f, the, archaeal, methanopyrus, kandleri, strain, 116, can, even, reproduce, at, 122, c, 252, f, the, highest, recorded, temperature, of, any, organism, other, archaea, exist, in, very, acidic, or, alkaline, conditions, for, example, one, of, the, most, extreme, archaean, acidophiles, is, picrophilus, torridus, which, grows, at, ph, 0, which, is, equivalent, to, thriving, in, 1, 2, molar, sulfuric, acid, this, resistance, to, extreme, environments, has, made, archaea, the, focus, of, speculation, about, the, possible, properties, of, extraterrestrial, life, some, extremophile, habitats, are, not, dissimilar, to, those, on, mars, leading, to, the, suggestion, that, viable, microbes, could, be, transferred, between, planets, in, meteorites, recently, several, studies, have, shown, that, archaea, exist, not, only, in, mesophilic, and, thermophilic, environments, but, are, also, present, sometimes, in, high, numbers, at, low, temperatures, as, well, for, example, archaea, are, common, in, cold, oceanic, environments, such, as, polar, seas, even, more, significant, are, the, large, numbers, of, archaea, found, throughout, the, world, s, oceans, in, non, extreme, habitats, among, the, plankton, community, as, part, of, the, picoplankton, although, these, archaea, can, be, present, in, extremely, high, numbers, up, to, 40, of, the, microbial, biomass, almost, none, of, these, species, have, been, isolated, and, studied, in, pure, culture, consequently, our, understanding, of, the, role, of, archaea, in, ocean, ecology, is, rudimentary, so, their, full, influence, on, global, biogeochemical, cycles, remains, largely, unexplored, some, marine, thermoproteota, are, capable, of, nitrification, suggesting, these, organisms, may, affect, the, oceanic, nitrogen, cycle, although, these, oceanic, thermoproteota, may, also, use, other, sources, of, energy, vast, numbers, of, archaea, are, also, found, in, the, sediments, that, cover, the, sea, floor, with, these, organisms, making, up, the, majority, of, living, cells, at, depths, over, 1, meter, below, the, ocean, bottom, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, in, all, oceanic, surface, sediments, from, 1000, to, 10, 000, m, water, depth, the, impact, of, viral, infection, is, higher, on, archaea, than, on, bacteria, and, virus, induced, lysis, of, archaea, accounts, for, up, to, one, third, of, the, total, microbial, biomass, killed, resulting, in, the, release, of, 0, 3, to, 0, 5, gigatons, of, carbon, per, year, globally, archaea, recycle, elements, such, as, carbon, nitrogen, and, sulfur, through, their, various, habitats, archaea, carry, out, many, steps, in, the, nitrogen, cycle, this, includes, both, reactions, that, remove, nitrogen, from, ecosystems, such, as, nitrate, based, respiration, and, denitrification, as, well, as, processes, that, introduce, nitrogen, such, as, nitrate, assimilation, and, nitrogen, fixation, researchers, recently, discovered, archaeal, involvement, in, ammonia, oxidation, reactions, these, reactions, are, particularly, important, in, the, oceans, the, archaea, also, appear, crucial, for, ammonia, oxidation, in, soils, they, produce, nitrite, which, other, microbes, then, oxidize, to, nitrate, plants, and, other, organisms, consume, the, latter, in, the, sulfur, cycle, archaea, that, grow, by, oxidizing, sulfur, compounds, release, this, element, from, rocks, making, it, available, to, other, organisms, but, the, archaea, that, do, this, such, as, sulfolobus, produce, sulfuric, acid, as, a, waste, product, and, the, growth, of, these, organisms, in, abandoned, mines, can, contribute, to, acid, mine, drainage, and, other, environmental, damage, in, the, carbon, cycle, methanogen, archaea, remove, hydrogen, and, play, an, important, role, in, the, decay, of, organic, matter, by, the, populations, of, microorganisms, that, act, as, decomposers, in, anaerobic, ecosystems, such, as, sediments, marshes, and, sewage, treatment, works, the, well, characterized, interactions, between, archaea, and, other, organisms, are, either, mutual, or, commensal, there, are, no, clear, examples, of, known, archaeal, pathogens, or, parasites, but, some, species, of, methanogens, have, been, suggested, to, be, involved, in, infections, in, the, mouth, and, nanoarchaeum, equitans, may, be, a, parasite, of, another, species, of, archaea, since, it, only, survives, and, reproduces, within, the, cells, of, the, crenarchaeon, ignicoccus, hospitalis, and, appears, to, offer, no, benefit, to, its, host, mutualism, is, an, interaction, between, individuals, of, different, species, that, results, in, positive, beneficial, effects, on, per, capita, reproduction, and, or, survival, of, the, interacting, populations, one, well, understood, example, of, mutualism, is, the, interaction, between, protozoa, and, methanogenic, archaea, in, the, digestive, tracts, of, animals, that, digest, cellulose, such, as, ruminants, and, termites, in, these, anaerobic, environments, protozoa, break, down, plant, cellulose, to, obtain, energy, this, process, releases, hydrogen, as, a, waste, product, but, high, levels, of, hydrogen, reduce, energy, production, when, methanogens, convert, hydrogen, to, methane, protozoa, benefit, from, more, energy, in, anaerobic, protozoa, such, as, plagiopyla, frontata, trimyema, heterometopus, and, metopus, contortus, archaea, reside, inside, the, protozoa, and, consume, hydrogen, produced, in, their, hydrogenosomes, archaea, associate, with, larger, organisms, too, for, example, the, marine, archaean, cenarchaeum, symbiosum, is, an, endosymbiont, of, the, sponge, axinella, mexicana, some, archaea, are, commensals, benefiting, from, an, association, without, helping, or, harming, the, other, organism, for, example, the, methanogen, methanobrevibacter, smithii, is, by, far, the, most, common, archaean, in, the, human, flora, making, up, about, one, in, ten, of, the, prokaryotes, in, the, human, gut, in, termites, and, in, humans, these, methanogens, may, in, fact, be, mutualists, interacting, with, other, microbes, in, the, gut, to, aid, digestion, archaean, communities, associate, with, a, range, of, other, organisms, such, as, on, the, surface, of, corals, and, in, the, region, of, soil, that, surrounds, plant, roots, the, rhizosphere, although, archaea, do, not, have, a, historical, reputation, of, being, pathogens, archaea, are, often, found, with, similar, genomes, to, more, common, pathogen, like, e, coli, showing, metabolic, links, and, evolutionary, history, with, today, s, pathogens, archaea, have, been, inconsistently, detected, in, clinical, studies, because, of, the, lack, of, categorization, of, archaea, into, more, specific, species, extremophile, archaea, particularly, those, resistant, either, to, heat, or, to, extremes, of, acidity, and, alkalinity, are, a, source, of, enzymes, that, function, under, these, harsh, conditions, these, enzymes, have, found, many, uses, for, example, thermostable, dna, polymerases, such, as, the, pfu, dna, polymerase, from, pyrococcus, furiosus, revolutionized, molecular, biology, by, allowing, the, polymerase, chain, reaction, to, be, used, in, research, as, a, simple, and, rapid, technique, for, cloning, dna, in, industry, amylases, galactosidases, and, pullulanases, in, other, species, of, pyrococcus, that, function, at, over, 100, c, 212, f, allow, food, processing, at, high, temperatures, such, as, the, production, of, low, lactose, milk, and, whey, enzymes, from, these, thermophilic, archaea, also, tend, to, be, very, stable, in, organic, solvents, allowing, their, use, in, environmentally, friendly, processes, in, green, chemistry, that, synthesize, organic, compounds, this, stability, makes, them, easier, to, use, in, structural, biology, consequently, the, counterparts, of, bacterial, or, eukaryotic, enzymes, from, extremophile, archaea, are, often, used, in, structural, studies, in, contrast, with, the, range, of, applications, of, archaean, enzymes, the, use, of, the, organisms, themselves, in, biotechnology, is, less, developed, methanogenic, archaea, are, a, vital, part, of, sewage, treatment, since, they, are, part, of, the, community, of, microorganisms, that, carry, out, anaerobic, digestion, and, produce, biogas, in, mineral, processing, acidophilic, archaea, display, promise, for, the, extraction, of, metals, from, ores, including, gold, cobalt, and, copper, archaea, host, a, new, class, of, potentially, useful, antibiotics, a, few, of, these, archaeocins, have, been, characterized, but, hundreds, more, are, believed, to, exist, especially, within, haloarchaea, and, sulfolobus, these, compounds, differ, in, structure, from, bacterial, antibiotics, so, they, may, have, novel, modes, of, action, in, addition, they, may, allow, the, creation, of, new, selectable, markers, for, use, in, archaeal, molecular, biology
