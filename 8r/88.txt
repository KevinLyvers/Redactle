the, sensory, nervous, system, is, a, part, of, the, nervous, system, responsible, for, processing, sensory, information, a, sensory, system, consists, of, sensory, neurons, including, the, sensory, receptor, cells, neural, pathways, and, parts, of, the, brain, involved, in, sensory, perception, and, interoception, commonly, recognized, sensory, systems, are, those, for, vision, hearing, touch, taste, smell, balance, and, visceral, sensation, sense, organs, are, transducers, that, convert, data, from, the, outer, physical, world, to, the, realm, of, the, mind, where, people, interpret, the, information, creating, their, perception, of, the, world, around, them, the, receptive, field, is, the, area, of, the, body, or, environment, to, which, a, receptor, organ, and, receptor, cells, respond, for, instance, the, part, of, the, world, an, eye, can, see, is, its, receptive, field, the, light, that, each, rod, or, cone, can, see, is, its, receptive, field, receptive, fields, have, been, identified, for, the, visual, system, auditory, system, and, somatosensory, system, while, debate, exists, among, neurologists, as, to, the, specific, number, of, senses, due, to, differing, definitions, of, what, constitutes, a, sense, gautama, buddha, and, aristotle, classified, five, traditional, human, senses, which, have, become, universally, accepted, touch, taste, smell, vision, and, hearing, other, senses, that, have, been, well, accepted, in, most, mammals, including, humans, include, pain, balance, kinaesthesia, and, temperature, furthermore, some, nonhuman, animals, have, been, shown, to, possess, alternate, senses, including, magnetoreception, and, electroreception, the, initialization, of, sensation, stems, from, the, response, of, a, specific, receptor, to, a, physical, stimulus, the, receptors, which, react, to, the, stimulus, and, initiate, the, process, of, sensation, are, commonly, characterized, in, four, distinct, categories, chemoreceptors, photoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, and, thermoreceptors, all, receptors, receive, distinct, physical, stimuli, and, transduce, the, signal, into, an, electrical, action, potential, this, action, potential, then, travels, along, afferent, neurons, to, specific, brain, regions, where, it, is, processed, and, interpreted, chemoreceptors, or, chemosensors, detect, certain, chemical, stimuli, and, transduce, that, signal, into, an, electrical, action, potential, the, two, primary, types, of, chemoreceptors, are, photoreceptors, are, neuron, cells, and, are, specialized, units, that, play, the, main, role, in, initiating, vision, function, photoreceptors, are, light, sensitive, cells, that, capture, different, wavelengths, of, light, different, types, of, photoreceptors, are, able, to, respond, to, the, varying, light, wavelengths, in, relation, to, color, and, transduce, them, into, electrical, signals, photoreceptors, are, capable, of, phototransduction, a, process, which, converts, light, electromagnetic, radiation, into, among, other, types, of, energy, a, membrane, potential, there, are, five, compartments, that, are, present, in, these, cells, each, compartment, corresponds, to, differences, in, function, and, structure, the, first, compartment, is, the, outer, segment, os, where, it, is, responsible, for, capturing, light, and, transducing, it, the, second, compartment, is, the, inner, segment, is, which, includes, the, necessary, organelles, that, function, in, cellular, metabolism, and, biosynthesis, mainly, these, organelles, include, mitochondria, golgi, apparatus, and, endoplasmic, reticulum, as, well, as, among, others, the, third, compartment, is, the, connecting, cilium, cc, as, its, name, suggests, cc, works, to, connect, the, os, and, the, is, regions, together, for, the, purpose, of, essential, protein, trafficking, the, fourth, compartment, contains, the, nucleus, and, is, a, continuation, of, the, is, region, known, as, the, nuclear, region, finally, the, fifth, compartment, is, the, synaptic, region, where, it, acts, as, a, final, terminal, for, the, signal, consisting, of, synaptic, vesicles, in, this, region, glutamate, neurotransmitter, is, transmitted, from, the, cell, to, secondary, neuron, cells, the, three, primary, types, of, photoreceptors, are, cones, are, photoreceptors, which, respond, significantly, to, color, in, humans, the, three, different, types, of, cones, correspond, with, a, primary, response, to, short, wavelength, blue, medium, wavelength, green, and, long, wavelength, yellow, red, rods, are, photoreceptors, which, are, very, sensitive, to, the, intensity, of, light, allowing, for, vision, in, dim, lighting, the, concentrations, and, ratio, of, rods, to, cones, is, strongly, correlated, with, whether, an, animal, is, diurnal, or, nocturnal, in, humans, rods, outnumber, cones, by, approximately, 20, 1, while, in, nocturnal, animals, such, as, the, tawny, owl, the, ratio, is, closer, to, 1000, 1, ganglion, cells, reside, in, the, adrenal, medulla, and, retina, where, they, are, involved, in, the, sympathetic, response, of, the, 1, 3, million, ganglion, cells, present, in, the, retina, 1, 2, are, believed, to, be, photosensitive, ganglia, these, photosensitive, ganglia, play, a, role, in, conscious, vision, for, some, animals, and, are, believed, to, do, the, same, in, humans, mechanoreceptors, are, sensory, receptors, which, respond, to, mechanical, forces, such, as, pressure, or, distortion, while, mechanoreceptors, are, present, in, hair, cells, and, play, an, integral, role, in, the, vestibular, and, auditory, systems, the, majority, of, mechanoreceptors, are, cutaneous, and, are, grouped, into, four, categories, thermoreceptors, are, sensory, receptors, which, respond, to, varying, temperatures, while, the, mechanisms, through, which, these, receptors, operate, is, unclear, recent, discoveries, have, shown, that, mammals, have, at, least, two, distinct, types, of, thermoreceptors, trpv1, is, a, heat, activated, channel, that, acts, as, a, small, heat, detecting, thermometer, in, the, membrane, which, begins, the, polarization, of, the, neural, fiber, when, exposed, to, changes, in, temperature, ultimately, this, allows, us, to, detect, ambient, temperature, in, the, warm, hot, range, similarly, the, molecular, cousin, to, trpv1, trpm8, is, a, cold, activated, ion, channel, that, responds, to, cold, both, cold, and, hot, receptors, are, segregated, by, distinct, subpopulations, of, sensory, nerve, fibers, which, shows, us, that, the, information, coming, into, the, spinal, cord, is, originally, separate, each, sensory, receptor, has, its, own, labeled, line, to, convey, a, simple, sensation, experienced, by, the, recipient, ultimately, trp, channels, act, as, thermosensors, channels, that, help, us, to, detect, changes, in, ambient, temperatures, nociceptors, respond, to, potentially, damaging, stimuli, by, sending, signals, to, the, spinal, cord, and, brain, this, process, called, nociception, usually, causes, the, perception, of, pain, they, are, found, in, internal, organs, as, well, as, on, the, surface, of, the, body, nociceptors, detect, different, kinds, of, damaging, stimuli, or, actual, damage, those, that, only, respond, when, tissues, are, damaged, are, known, as, sleeping, or, silent, nociceptors, all, stimuli, received, by, the, receptors, listed, above, are, transduced, to, an, action, potential, which, is, carried, along, one, or, more, afferent, neurons, towards, a, specific, area, of, the, brain, while, the, term, sensory, cortex, is, often, used, informally, to, refer, to, the, somatosensory, cortex, the, term, more, accurately, refers, to, the, multiple, areas, of, the, brain, at, which, senses, are, received, to, be, processed, for, the, five, traditional, senses, in, humans, this, includes, the, primary, and, secondary, cortices, of, the, different, senses, the, somatosensory, cortex, the, visual, cortex, the, auditory, cortex, the, primary, olfactory, cortex, and, the, gustatory, cortex, other, modalities, have, corresponding, sensory, cortex, areas, as, well, including, the, vestibular, cortex, for, the, sense, of, balance, the, human, sensory, system, consists, of, the, following, subsystems, located, in, the, parietal, lobe, the, primary, somatosensory, cortex, is, the, primary, receptive, area, for, the, sense, of, touch, and, proprioception, in, the, somatosensory, system, this, cortex, is, further, divided, into, brodmann, areas, 1, 2, and, 3, brodmann, area, 3, is, considered, the, primary, processing, center, of, the, somatosensory, cortex, as, it, receives, significantly, more, input, from, the, thalamus, has, neurons, highly, responsive, to, somatosensory, stimuli, and, can, evoke, somatic, sensations, through, electrical, stimulation, areas, 1, and, 2, receive, most, of, their, input, from, area, 3, there, are, also, pathways, for, proprioception, via, the, cerebellum, and, motor, control, via, brodmann, area, 4, see, also, s2, secondary, somatosensory, cortex, the, visual, cortex, refers, to, the, primary, visual, cortex, labeled, v1, or, brodmann, area, 17, as, well, as, the, extrastriate, visual, cortical, areas, v2, v5, located, in, the, occipital, lobe, v1, acts, as, the, primary, relay, station, for, visual, input, transmitting, information, to, two, primary, pathways, labeled, the, dorsal, and, ventral, streams, the, dorsal, stream, includes, areas, v2, and, v5, and, is, used, in, interpreting, visual, where, and, how, the, ventral, stream, includes, areas, v2, and, v4, and, is, used, in, interpreting, what, increases, in, task, negative, activity, are, observed, in, the, ventral, attention, network, after, abrupt, changes, in, sensory, stimuli, at, the, onset, and, offset, of, task, blocks, and, at, the, end, of, a, completed, trial, located, in, the, temporal, lobe, the, auditory, cortex, is, the, primary, receptive, area, for, sound, information, the, auditory, cortex, is, composed, of, brodmann, areas, 41, and, 42, also, known, as, the, anterior, transverse, temporal, area, 41, and, the, posterior, transverse, temporal, area, 42, respectively, both, areas, act, similarly, and, are, integral, in, receiving, and, processing, the, signals, transmitted, from, auditory, receptors, located, in, the, temporal, lobe, the, primary, olfactory, cortex, is, the, primary, receptive, area, for, olfaction, or, smell, unique, to, the, olfactory, and, gustatory, systems, at, least, in, mammals, is, the, implementation, of, both, peripheral, and, central, mechanisms, of, action, the, peripheral, mechanisms, involve, olfactory, receptor, neurons, which, transduce, a, chemical, signal, along, the, olfactory, nerve, which, terminates, in, the, olfactory, bulb, the, chemoreceptors, in, the, receptor, neurons, that, start, the, signal, cascade, are, g, protein, coupled, receptors, the, central, mechanisms, include, the, convergence, of, olfactory, nerve, axons, into, glomeruli, in, the, olfactory, bulb, where, the, signal, is, then, transmitted, to, the, anterior, olfactory, nucleus, the, piriform, cortex, the, medial, amygdala, and, the, entorhinal, cortex, all, of, which, make, up, the, primary, olfactory, cortex, in, contrast, to, vision, and, hearing, the, olfactory, bulbs, are, not, cross, hemispheric, the, right, bulb, connects, to, the, right, hemisphere, and, the, left, bulb, connects, to, the, left, hemisphere, the, gustatory, cortex, is, the, primary, receptive, area, for, taste, the, word, taste, is, used, in, a, technical, sense, to, refer, specifically, to, sensations, coming, from, taste, buds, on, the, tongue, the, five, qualities, of, taste, detected, by, the, tongue, include, sourness, bitterness, sweetness, saltiness, and, the, protein, taste, quality, called, umami, in, contrast, the, term, flavor, refers, to, the, experience, generated, through, integration, of, taste, with, smell, and, tactile, information, the, gustatory, cortex, consists, of, two, primary, structures, the, anterior, insula, located, on, the, insular, lobe, and, the, frontal, operculum, located, on, the, frontal, lobe, similarly, to, the, olfactory, cortex, the, gustatory, pathway, operates, through, both, peripheral, and, central, mechanisms, peripheral, taste, receptors, located, on, the, tongue, soft, palate, pharynx, and, esophagus, transmit, the, received, signal, to, primary, sensory, axons, where, the, signal, is, projected, to, the, nucleus, of, the, solitary, tract, in, the, medulla, or, the, gustatory, nucleus, of, the, solitary, tract, complex, the, signal, is, then, transmitted, to, the, thalamus, which, in, turn, projects, the, signal, to, several, regions, of, the, neocortex, including, the, gustatory, cortex, the, neural, processing, of, taste, is, affected, at, nearly, every, stage, of, processing, by, concurrent, somatosensory, information, from, the, tongue, that, is, mouthfeel, scent, in, contrast, is, not, combined, with, taste, to, create, flavor, until, higher, cortical, processing, regions, such, as, the, insula, and, orbitofrontal, cortex, most, sensory, systems, have, a, quiescent, state, that, is, the, state, that, a, sensory, system, converges, to, when, there, is, no, input, this, is, well, defined, for, a, linear, time, invariant, system, whose, input, space, is, a, vector, space, and, thus, by, definition, has, a, point, of, zero, it, is, also, well, defined, for, any, passive, sensory, system, that, is, a, system, that, operates, without, needing, input, power, the, quiescent, state, is, the, state, the, system, converges, to, when, there, is, no, input, power, it, is, not, always, well, defined, for, nonlinear, nonpassive, sensory, organs, since, they, can, t, function, without, input, energy, for, example, a, cochlea, is, not, a, passive, organ, but, actively, vibrates, its, own, sensory, hairs, to, improve, its, sensitivity, this, manifests, as, otoacoustic, emissions, in, healthy, ears, and, tinnitus, in, pathological, ears, there, is, still, a, quiescent, state, for, the, cochlea, since, there, is, a, well, defined, mode, of, power, input, that, it, receives, vibratory, energy, on, the, eardrum, which, provides, an, unambiguous, definition, of, zero, input, power, some, sensory, systems, can, have, multiple, quiescent, states, depending, on, its, history, like, flip, flops, and, magnetic, material, with, hysteresis, it, can, also, adapt, to, different, quiescent, states, in, complete, darkness, the, retinal, cells, become, extremely, sensitive, and, there, is, noticeable, visual, snow, caused, by, the, retinal, cells, firing, randomly, without, any, light, input, in, brighter, light, the, retinal, cells, become, much, less, sensitive, consequently, decreasing, visual, noise, quiescent, state, is, less, well, defined, when, the, sensory, organ, can, be, controlled, by, other, systems, like, a, dog, s, ears, that, turn, towards, the, front, or, the, sides, as, the, brain, commands, some, spiders, can, use, their, nets, as, a, large, touch, organ, like, weaving, a, skin, for, themselves, even, in, the, absence, of, anything, falling, on, the, net, hungry, spiders, may, increase, web, thread, tension, so, as, to, respond, promptly, even, to, usually, less, noticeable, and, less, profitable, prey, such, as, small, fruit, flies, creating, two, different, quiescent, states, for, the, net, things, become, completely, ill, defined, for, a, system, which, connects, its, output, to, its, own, input, thus, ever, moving, without, any, external, input, the, prime, example, is, the, brain, with, its, default, mode, network
