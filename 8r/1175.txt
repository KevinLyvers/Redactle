see, text, paramecium, p, r, m, i, s, i, m, parr, mee, s, ee, m, s, i, m, see, m, plural, paramecia, only, when, used, as, a, vernacular, name, is, a, genus, of, eukaryotic, unicellular, ciliates, widespread, in, freshwater, brackish, and, marine, environments, paramecia, are, often, abundant, in, stagnant, basins, and, ponds, because, some, species, are, readily, cultivated, and, easily, induced, to, conjugate, and, divide, they, have, been, widely, used, in, classrooms, and, laboratories, to, study, biological, processes, paramecium, species, are, commonly, studied, as, model, organisms, of, the, ciliate, group, and, have, been, characterized, as, the, white, rats, of, the, phylum, ciliophora, paramecium, were, among, the, first, ciliates, to, be, observed, by, microscopists, in, the, late, 17th, century, they, were, most, likely, known, to, the, dutch, pioneer, of, protozoology, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, and, were, clearly, described, by, his, contemporary, christiaan, huygens, in, a, letter, from, 1678, the, earliest, known, illustration, of, a, paramecium, species, was, published, anonymously, in, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, in, 1703, in, 1718, the, french, mathematics, teacher, and, microscopist, louis, joblot, published, a, description, and, illustration, of, a, microscopic, poisson, fish, which, he, discovered, in, an, infusion, of, oak, bark, in, water, joblot, gave, this, creature, the, name, chausson, or, slipper, and, the, phrase, slipper, animalcule, remained, in, use, as, a, colloquial, epithet, for, paramecium, throughout, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, name, paramecium, constructed, from, the, greek, param, k, s, oblong, was, coined, in, 1752, by, the, english, microscopist, john, hill, who, applied, the, name, generally, to, animalcules, which, have, no, visible, limbs, or, tails, and, are, of, an, irregularly, oblong, figure, in, 1773, o, f, m, ller, the, first, researcher, to, place, the, genus, within, the, linnaean, system, of, taxonomy, adopted, the, name, paramecium, but, changed, the, spelling, to, param, cium, in, 1783, johann, hermann, changed, the, spelling, once, more, to, param, cium, c, g, ehrenberg, in, a, major, study, of, the, infusoria, published, in, 1838, restored, hill, s, original, spelling, for, the, name, and, most, researchers, have, followed, his, lead, species, of, paramecium, range, in, size, from, 0, 06, mm, to, 0, 3, mm, in, length, cells, are, typically, ovoid, elongate, or, foot, or, cigar, shaped, the, body, of, the, cell, is, enclosed, by, a, stiff, but, elastic, structure, called, the, pellicle, the, pellicle, consists, of, an, outer, cell, membrane, plasma, membrane, a, layer, of, flattened, membrane, bound, sacs, called, alveoli, and, an, inner, membrane, called, the, epiplasm, the, pellicle, is, not, smooth, but, textured, with, hexagonal, or, rectangular, depressions, each, of, these, polygons, is, perforated, by, a, central, aperture, through, which, a, single, cilium, projects, between, the, alveolar, sacs, of, the, pellicle, most, species, of, paramecium, have, closely, spaced, spindle, shaped, trichocysts, explosive, organelles, that, discharge, thin, non, toxic, filaments, often, used, for, defensive, purposes, typically, an, anal, pore, cytoproct, is, located, on, the, ventral, surface, in, the, posterior, half, of, the, cell, in, all, species, there, is, a, deep, oral, groove, running, from, the, anterior, of, the, cell, to, its, midpoint, this, is, lined, with, inconspicuous, cilia, which, beat, continuously, drawing, food, into, the, cell, paramecium, are, primarily, heterotrophic, feeding, on, bacteria, and, other, small, organisms, a, few, species, are, mixotrophs, deriving, some, nutrients, from, endosymbiotic, algae, chlorella, carried, in, the, cytoplasm, of, the, cell, osmoregulation, is, carried, out, by, contractile, vacuoles, which, actively, expel, water, from, the, cell, to, compensate, for, fluid, absorbed, by, osmosis, from, its, surroundings, the, number, of, contractile, vacuoles, varies, depending, on, the, species, a, paramecium, propels, itself, by, whip, like, movements, of, the, cilia, which, are, arranged, in, tightly, spaced, rows, around, the, outside, of, the, body, the, beat, of, each, cilium, has, two, phases, a, fast, effective, stroke, during, which, the, cilium, is, relatively, stiff, followed, by, a, slow, recovery, stroke, during, which, the, cilium, curls, loosely, to, one, side, and, sweeps, forward, in, a, counter, clockwise, fashion, the, densely, arrayed, cilia, move, in, a, coordinated, fashion, with, waves, of, activity, moving, across, the, ciliary, carpet, creating, an, effect, sometimes, likened, to, that, of, the, wind, blowing, across, a, field, of, grain, the, paramecium, spirals, through, the, water, as, it, progresses, when, it, happens, to, encounter, an, obstacle, the, effective, stroke, of, its, cilia, is, reversed, and, the, organism, swims, backward, for, a, brief, time, before, resuming, its, forward, progress, this, is, called, the, avoidance, reaction, if, it, runs, into, the, solid, object, again, it, repeats, this, process, until, it, can, get, past, the, object, it, has, been, calculated, that, a, paramecium, expends, more, than, half, of, its, energy, in, propelling, itself, through, the, water, this, ciliary, method, of, locomotion, has, been, found, to, be, less, than, 1, efficient, this, low, percentage, is, nevertheless, close, to, the, maximum, theoretical, efficiency, that, can, be, achieved, by, an, organism, equipped, with, cilia, as, short, as, those, of, the, members, of, paramecium, paramecium, feed, on, microorganisms, such, as, bacteria, algae, and, yeasts, to, gather, food, the, paramecium, makes, movements, with, cilia, to, sweep, prey, organisms, along, with, some, water, through, the, oral, groove, vestibulum, or, vestibule, and, into, the, cell, the, food, passes, from, the, cilia, lined, oral, groove, into, a, narrower, structure, known, as, the, buccal, cavity, gullet, from, there, food, particles, pass, through, a, small, opening, called, the, cytostome, or, cell, mouth, and, move, into, the, interior, of, the, cell, as, food, enters, the, cell, it, is, gathered, into, food, vacuoles, which, are, periodically, closed, off, and, released, into, the, cytoplasm, where, they, begin, circulating, through, the, cell, body, by, the, streaming, movement, of, the, cell, contents, a, process, called, cyclosis, or, cytoplasmic, streaming, as, a, food, vacuole, moves, along, enzymes, from, the, cytoplasm, enter, it, to, digest, the, contents, as, enzymatic, digestion, proceeds, the, vacuole, contents, become, more, acidic, within, five, minutes, of, a, vacuole, s, formation, the, ph, of, its, contents, drops, from, 7, to, 3, as, digested, nutrients, pass, into, the, cytoplasm, the, vacuole, shrinks, when, the, fully, digested, vacuole, reaches, the, anal, pore, it, ruptures, expelling, its, waste, contents, outside, the, cell, some, species, of, paramecium, form, mutualistic, relationships, with, other, organisms, paramecium, bursaria, and, paramecium, chlorelligerum, harbour, endosymbiotic, green, algae, from, which, they, derive, nutrients, and, a, degree, of, protection, from, predators, such, as, didinium, nasutum, numerous, bacterial, endosymbionts, have, been, identified, in, species, of, paramecium, some, intracellular, bacteria, known, as, kappa, particles, give, paramecium, the, ability, to, kill, other, strains, of, paramecium, that, lack, kappa, particles, the, genome, of, the, species, paramecium, tetraurelia, has, been, sequenced, providing, evidence, for, three, whole, genome, duplications, in, some, ciliates, like, stylonychia, and, paramecium, only, uga, is, decoded, as, a, stop, codon, while, uag, and, uaa, are, reassigned, as, sense, codons, that, is, codons, that, code, for, standard, amino, acids, coding, for, the, amino, acid, glutamic, acid, the, question, of, whether, paramecium, exhibit, learning, has, been, the, object, of, a, great, deal, of, experimentation, yielding, equivocal, results, however, a, study, published, in, 2006, seems, to, show, that, paramecium, caudatum, may, be, trained, through, the, application, of, a, 6, 5, volt, electric, current, to, discriminate, between, brightness, levels, this, experiment, has, been, cited, as, a, possible, instance, of, cell, memory, or, epigenetic, learning, in, organisms, with, no, nervous, system, like, all, ciliates, paramecium, have, a, dual, nuclear, apparatus, consisting, of, a, polyploid, macronucleus, and, one, or, more, diploid, micronuclei, the, macronucleus, controls, non, reproductive, cell, functions, expressing, the, genes, needed, for, daily, functioning, the, micronucleus, is, the, generative, or, germline, nucleus, containing, the, genetic, material, that, is, passed, along, from, one, generation, to, the, next, paramecium, reproduction, is, asexual, by, binary, fission, which, has, been, characterized, as, the, sole, mode, of, reproduction, in, ciliates, conjugation, being, a, sexual, phenomenon, not, directly, resulting, in, increase, of, numbers, during, fission, the, macronucleus, splits, by, a, type, of, amitosis, and, the, micronuclei, undergo, mitosis, the, cell, then, divides, transversally, and, each, new, cell, obtains, a, copy, of, the, micronucleus, and, the, macronucleus, fission, may, occur, spontaneously, in, the, course, of, the, vegetative, cell, cycle, under, certain, conditions, it, may, be, preceded, by, self, fertilization, autogamy, or, it, may, immediately, follow, conjugation, in, which, paramecium, of, compatible, mating, types, fuse, temporarily, and, exchange, genetic, material, in, ciliates, such, as, paramecium, conjugation, is, a, sexual, phenomenon, that, results, in, genetic, recombination, and, nuclear, reorganization, within, the, cell, during, conjugation, two, paramecium, of, a, compatible, mating, type, come, together, and, form, a, bridge, between, their, cytoplasms, their, respective, micronuclei, undergo, meiosis, and, haploid, micronuclei, are, exchanged, over, the, bridge, following, conjugation, the, cells, separate, the, old, macronuclei, are, destroyed, and, both, post, conjugants, form, new, macronuclei, by, amplification, of, dna, in, their, micronuclei, conjugation, is, followed, by, one, or, more, exconjugant, divisions, in, paramecium, caudatum, the, stages, of, conjugation, are, as, follows, see, diagram, at, right, in, the, asexual, fission, phase, of, growth, during, which, cell, divisions, occur, by, mitosis, rather, than, meiosis, clonal, aging, occurs, leading, to, a, gradual, loss, of, vitality, in, some, species, such, as, the, well, studied, paramecium, tetraurelia, the, asexual, line, of, clonally, aging, paramecium, loses, vitality, and, expires, after, about, 200, fissions, if, the, cells, fail, to, undergo, autogamy, or, conjugation, the, basis, for, clonal, aging, was, clarified, by, transplantation, experiments, of, aufderheide, in, 1986, when, macronuclei, of, clonally, young, paramecium, were, injected, into, paramecium, of, standard, clonal, age, the, lifespan, clonal, fissions, of, the, recipient, was, prolonged, in, contrast, transfer, of, cytoplasm, from, clonally, young, paramecium, did, not, prolong, the, lifespan, of, the, recipient, these, experiments, indicated, that, the, macronucleus, rather, than, the, cytoplasm, is, responsible, for, clonal, aging, other, experiments, by, smith, sonneborn, holmes, and, holmes, and, gilley, and, blackburn, demonstrated, that, during, clonal, aging, dna, damage, increases, dramatically, thus, dna, damage, in, the, macronucleus, appears, to, be, the, cause, of, aging, in, p, tetraurelia, in, this, single, celled, protist, aging, appears, to, proceed, as, it, does, in, multicellular, eukaryotes, as, described, in, dna, damage, theory, of, aging, when, clonally, aged, p, tetraurelia, are, stimulated, to, undergo, meiosis, in, association, with, either, conjugation, or, automixis, the, genetic, descendants, are, rejuvenated, and, are, able, to, have, many, more, mitotic, binary, fission, divisions, during, either, of, these, processes, the, micronuclei, of, the, cell, s, undergo, meiosis, the, old, macronucleus, disintegrates, and, a, new, macronucleus, is, formed, by, replication, of, the, micronuclear, dna, that, had, recently, undergone, meiosis, there, is, apparently, little, if, any, dna, damage, in, the, new, macronucleus, these, findings, further, solidify, that, clonal, aging, is, due, in, large, part, to, a, progressive, accumulation, of, dna, damage, and, that, rejuvenation, is, due, to, the, repair, of, this, damage, in, the, micronucleus, during, meiosis, meiosis, appears, to, be, an, adaptation, for, dna, repair, and, rejuvenation, in, p, tetraurelia, in, p, tetraurelia, ctlp, protein, is, a, key, factor, needed, for, the, completion, of, meiosis, during, sexual, reproduction, and, recovery, of, viable, sexual, progeny, the, ctlp, and, mre11, nuclease, complex, are, essential, for, accurate, processing, and, repair, of, double, strand, breaks, during, homologous, recombination, paramecium, aurelia, species, complex, other, species
