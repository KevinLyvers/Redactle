seaweed, or, macroalgae, refers, to, thousands, of, species, of, macroscopic, multicellular, marine, algae, the, term, includes, some, types, of, rhodophyta, red, phaeophyta, brown, and, chlorophyta, green, macroalgae, seaweed, species, such, as, kelps, provide, essential, nursery, habitat, for, fisheries, and, other, marine, species, and, thus, protect, food, sources, other, species, such, as, planktonic, algae, play, a, vital, role, in, capturing, carbon, and, producing, at, least, 50, of, earth, s, oxygen, natural, seaweed, ecosystems, are, sometimes, under, threat, from, human, activity, for, example, mechanical, dredging, of, kelp, destroys, the, resource, and, dependent, fisheries, other, forces, also, threaten, some, seaweed, ecosystems, for, example, a, wasting, disease, in, predators, of, purple, urchins, has, led, to, an, urchin, population, surge, which, has, destroyed, large, kelp, forest, regions, off, the, coast, of, california, humans, have, a, long, history, of, cultivating, seaweeds, for, their, uses, in, recent, years, seaweed, farming, has, become, a, global, agricultural, practice, providing, food, source, material, for, various, chemical, uses, such, as, carrageenan, cattle, feeds, and, fertilizers, due, to, their, importance, in, marine, ecologies, and, for, absorbing, carbon, dioxide, recent, attention, has, been, on, cultivating, seaweeds, as, a, potential, climate, change, mitigation, strategy, for, biosequestration, of, carbon, dioxide, alongside, other, benefits, like, nutrient, pollution, reduction, increased, habitat, for, coastal, aquatic, species, and, reducing, local, ocean, acidification, the, ipcc, special, report, on, the, ocean, and, cryosphere, in, a, changing, climate, recommends, further, research, attention, as, a, mitigation, tactic, seaweed, lacks, a, formal, definition, but, seaweed, generally, lives, in, the, ocean, and, is, visible, to, the, naked, eye, the, term, refers, to, both, flowering, plants, submerged, in, the, ocean, like, eelgrass, as, well, as, larger, marine, algae, generally, it, is, one, of, several, groups, of, multicellular, algae, red, green, and, brown, they, lack, one, common, multicellular, ancestor, forming, a, polyphyletic, group, in, addition, blue, green, algae, cyanobacteria, are, occasionally, considered, in, seaweed, literature, the, number, of, seaweed, species, is, still, a, topic, of, discussion, among, scientists, but, it, is, most, likely, that, there, are, several, thousand, species, of, seaweed, the, following, table, lists, a, very, few, example, genera, of, seaweed, seaweed, s, appearance, resembles, non, woody, terrestrial, plants, its, anatomy, includes, the, stipe, and, blade, are, collectively, known, as, the, frond, two, environmental, requirements, dominate, seaweed, ecology, these, are, seawater, or, at, least, brackish, water, and, light, sufficient, to, support, photosynthesis, another, common, requirement, is, an, attachment, point, and, therefore, seaweed, most, commonly, inhabits, the, littoral, zone, nearshore, waters, and, within, that, zone, on, rocky, shores, more, than, on, sand, or, shingle, in, addition, there, are, few, genera, e, g, sargassum, and, gracilaria, which, do, not, live, attached, to, the, sea, floor, but, float, freely, seaweed, occupies, various, ecological, niches, at, the, surface, they, are, only, wetted, by, the, tops, of, sea, spray, while, some, species, may, attach, to, a, substrate, several, meters, deep, in, some, areas, littoral, seaweed, colonies, can, extend, miles, out, to, sea, the, deepest, living, seaweed, are, some, species, of, red, algae, others, have, adapted, to, live, in, tidal, rock, pools, in, this, habitat, seaweed, must, withstand, rapidly, changing, temperature, and, salinity, and, occasional, drying, macroalgae, and, macroalgal, detritus, have, also, been, shown, to, be, an, important, food, source, for, benthic, organisms, because, macroalgae, shed, old, fronds, these, macroalgal, fronds, tend, to, be, utilized, by, benthos, in, the, intertidal, zone, close, to, the, shore, alternatively, pneumatocysts, gas, filled, bubbles, can, keep, the, macroalgae, thallus, afloat, fronds, are, transported, by, wind, and, currents, from, the, coast, into, the, deep, ocean, it, has, been, shown, that, benthic, organisms, also, at, several, 100, m, tend, to, utilize, these, macroalgae, remnants, as, macroalgae, takes, up, carbon, dioxide, and, releases, oxygen, in, the, photosynthesis, macroalgae, fronds, can, also, contribute, to, carbon, sequestration, in, the, ocean, when, the, macroalgal, fronds, drift, offshore, into, the, deep, ocean, basins, and, sink, to, the, sea, floor, without, being, remineralized, by, organisms, the, importance, of, this, process, for, blue, carbon, storage, is, currently, a, topic, of, discussion, among, scientists, nowadays, a, number, of, vectors, e, g, transport, on, ship, hulls, exchanges, among, shellfish, farmers, global, warming, opening, of, trans, oceanic, canals, all, combine, to, enhance, the, transfer, of, exotic, seaweeds, to, new, environments, since, the, piercing, of, the, suez, canal, the, situation, is, particularly, acute, in, the, mediterranean, sea, a, marine, biodiversity, hotspot, that, now, registers, over, 120, newly, introduced, seaweed, species, the, largest, number, in, the, world, as, of, 2019, 35, 818, 961, tonnes, were, produced, of, which, 97, 38, were, produced, in, asian, countries, seaweed, farming, or, kelp, farming, is, the, practice, of, cultivating, and, harvesting, seaweed, in, its, simplest, form, farmers, gather, from, natural, beds, while, at, the, other, extreme, farmers, fully, control, the, crop, s, life, cycle, the, seven, most, cultivated, taxa, are, eucheuma, spp, kappaphycus, alvarezii, gracilaria, spp, saccharina, japonica, undaria, pinnatifida, pyropia, spp, and, sargassum, fusiforme, eucheuma, and, k, alvarezii, are, attractive, for, carrageenan, a, gelling, agent, gracilaria, is, farmed, for, agar, the, rest, are, eaten, after, limited, processing, seaweeds, are, different, from, mangroves, and, seagrasses, as, they, are, photosynthetic, algal, organisms, and, are, non, flowering, the, largest, seaweed, producing, countries, as, of, 2022, are, china, 58, 62, and, indonesia, 28, 6, followed, by, south, korea, 5, 09, and, the, philippines, 4, 19, other, notable, producers, include, north, korea, 1, 6, japan, 1, 15, malaysia, 0, 53, zanzibar, tanzania, 0, 5, and, chile, 0, 3, seaweed, farming, has, frequently, been, developed, to, improve, economic, conditions, and, to, reduce, fishing, pressure, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, reported, that, world, production, in, 2019, was, over, 35, million, tonnes, north, america, produced, some, 23, 000, tonnes, of, wet, seaweed, alaska, maine, france, and, norway, each, more, than, doubled, their, seaweed, production, since, 2018, as, of, 2019, seaweed, represented, 30, of, marine, aquaculture, seaweed, has, a, variety, of, uses, for, which, it, is, farmed, or, foraged, seaweed, is, consumed, across, the, world, particularly,
