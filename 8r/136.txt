connective, tissue, is, one, of, the, four, primary, types, of, animal, tissue, along, with, epithelial, tissue, muscle, tissue, and, nervous, tissue, it, develops, mostly, from, the, mesenchyme, derived, from, the, mesoderm, the, middle, embryonic, germ, layer, connective, tissue, is, found, in, between, other, tissues, everywhere, in, the, body, including, the, nervous, system, the, three, meninges, membranes, that, envelop, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, are, composed, of, connective, tissue, most, types, of, connective, tissue, consists, of, three, main, components, elastic, and, collagen, fibers, ground, substance, and, cells, blood, and, lymph, are, classed, as, specialized, fluid, connective, tissues, that, do, not, contain, fiber, all, are, immersed, in, the, body, water, the, cells, of, connective, tissue, include, fibroblasts, adipocytes, macrophages, mast, cells, and, leukocytes, the, term, connective, tissue, in, german, bindegewebe, was, introduced, in, 1830, by, johannes, peter, m, ller, the, tissue, was, already, recognized, as, a, distinct, class, in, the, 18th, century, connective, tissue, can, be, broadly, classified, into, connective, tissue, proper, and, special, connective, tissue, connective, tissue, proper, consists, of, loose, connective, tissue, including, reticular, connective, tissue, and, adipose, tissue, and, dense, connective, tissue, subdivided, into, dense, regular, and, dense, irregular, connective, tissues, loose, and, dense, connective, tissue, are, distinguished, by, the, ratio, of, ground, substance, to, fibrous, tissue, loose, connective, tissue, has, much, more, ground, substance, and, a, relative, lack, of, fibrous, tissue, while, the, reverse, is, true, of, dense, connective, tissue, dense, regular, connective, tissue, found, in, structures, such, as, tendons, and, ligaments, is, characterized, by, collagen, fibers, arranged, in, an, orderly, parallel, fashion, giving, it, tensile, strength, in, one, direction, dense, irregular, connective, tissue, provides, strength, in, multiple, directions, by, its, dense, bundles, of, fibers, arranged, in, all, directions, special, connective, tissue, consists, of, cartilage, bone, blood, and, lymph, other, kinds, of, connective, tissues, include, fibrous, elastic, and, lymphoid, connective, tissues, fibroareolar, tissue, is, a, mix, of, fibrous, and, areolar, tissue, fibromuscular, tissue, is, made, up, of, fibrous, tissue, and, muscular, tissue, new, vascularised, connective, tissue, that, forms, in, the, process, of, wound, healing, is, termed, granulation, tissue, all, of, the, special, connective, tissue, types, have, been, included, as, a, subset, of, fascia, in, the, fascial, system, with, blood, and, lymph, classed, as, liquid, fascia, bone, and, cartilage, can, be, further, classified, as, supportive, connective, tissue, blood, and, lymph, can, also, be, categorized, as, fluid, connective, tissue, and, liquid, fascia, membranes, can, be, either, of, connective, tissue, or, epithelial, tissue, connective, tissue, membranes, include, the, meninges, the, three, membranes, covering, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, and, synovial, membranes, that, line, joint, cavities, mucous, membranes, and, serous, membranes, are, epithelial, with, an, underlying, layer, of, loose, connective, tissue, fiber, types, found, in, the, extracellular, matrix, are, collagen, fibers, elastic, fibers, and, reticular, fibers, ground, substance, is, a, clear, colorless, and, viscous, fluid, containing, glycosaminoglycans, and, proteoglycans, allowing, fixation, of, collagen, fibers, in, intercellular, spaces, examples, of, non, fibrous, connective, tissue, include, adipose, tissue, fat, and, blood, adipose, tissue, gives, mechanical, cushioning, to, the, body, among, other, functions, although, there, is, no, dense, collagen, network, in, adipose, tissue, groups, of, adipose, cells, are, kept, together, by, collagen, fibers, and, collagen, sheets, in, order, to, keep, fat, tissue, under, compression, in, place, for, example, the, sole, of, the, foot, both, the, ground, substance, and, proteins, fibers, create, the, matrix, for, connective, tissue, type, i, collagen, is, present, in, many, forms, of, connective, tissue, and, makes, up, about, 25, of, the, total, protein, content, of, the, mammalian, body, connective, tissue, has, a, wide, variety, of, functions, that, depend, on, the, types, of, cells, and, the, different, classes, of, fibers, involved, loose, and, dense, irregular, connective, tissue, formed, mainly, by, fibroblasts, and, collagen, fibers, have, an, important, role, in, providing, a, medium, for, oxygen, and, nutrients, to, diffuse, from, capillaries, to, cells, and, carbon, dioxide, and, waste, substances, to, diffuse, from, cells, back, into, circulation, they, also, allow, organs, to, resist, stretching, and, tearing, forces, dense, regular, connective, tissue, which, forms, organized, structures, is, a, major, functional, component, of, tendons, ligaments, and, aponeuroses, and, is, also, found, in, highly, specialized, organs, such, as, the, cornea, 161, elastic, fibers, made, from, elastin, and, fibrillin, also, provide, resistance, to, stretch, forces, 171, they, are, found, in, the, walls, of, large, blood, vessels, and, in, certain, ligaments, particularly, in, the, ligamenta, flava, 173, in, hematopoietic, and, lymphatic, tissues, reticular, fibers, made, by, reticular, cells, provide, the, stroma, or, structural, support, for, the, parenchyma, that, is, the, bulk, of, functional, substance, of, the, organ, 171, mesenchyme, is, a, type, of, connective, tissue, found, in, developing, organs, of, embryos, that, is, capable, of, differentiation, into, all, types, of, mature, connective, tissue, another, type, of, relatively, undifferentiated, connective, tissue, is, the, mucous, connective, tissue, known, as, wharton, s, jelly, found, inside, the, umbilical, cord, 160, this, tissue, is, no, longer, present, after, birth, leaving, only, scattered, mesenchymal, cells, throughout, the, body, various, types, of, specialized, tissues, and, cells, are, classified, under, the, spectrum, of, connective, tissue, and, are, as, diverse, as, brown, and, white, adipose, tissue, blood, cartilage, and, bone, 158, cells, of, the, immune, system, such, as, macrophages, mast, cells, plasma, cells, and, eosinophils, are, found, scattered, in, loose, connective, tissue, providing, the, ground, for, starting, inflammatory, and, immune, responses, upon, the, detection, of, antigens, 161, there, are, many, types, of, connective, tissue, disorders, such, as
