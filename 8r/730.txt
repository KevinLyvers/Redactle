15, see, text, and, article, the, brown, bear, ursus, arctos, is, a, large, bear, native, to, eurasia, and, north, america, it, is, one, of, the, largest, land, carnivorans, rivaled, in, size, only, by, its, closest, relative, the, polar, bear, which, is, much, less, variable, in, size, and, slightly, bigger, on, average, the, brown, bear, is, a, sexually, dimorphic, species, as, adult, males, are, larger, and, more, compactly, built, than, females, the, pelage, ranges, from, reddish, to, yellowish, brown, and, dark, brown, to, cream, in, color, it, evolved, large, hump, muscles, unique, among, bears, and, wide, 21, to, 36, cm, 8, 3, to, 14, 2, in, long, paws, to, effectively, dig, through, dirt, its, teeth, are, similar, to, those, of, other, bears, and, reflect, its, dietary, plasticity, throughout, the, brown, bear, s, range, it, inhabits, mainly, forested, habitats, in, elevations, of, up, to, 5, 000, m, 16, 000, ft, it, is, omnivorous, and, consumes, a, variety, of, plant, and, animal, species, contrary, to, popular, belief, the, brown, bear, derives, 90, of, its, diet, from, plants, when, hunting, it, will, target, animals, as, small, as, rodents, to, those, as, large, as, moose, or, muskoxen, in, parts, of, coastal, alaska, brown, bears, predominately, feed, on, spawning, salmon, that, come, near, shore, to, lay, their, eggs, for, most, of, the, year, it, is, a, solitary, animal, that, only, associates, when, mating, or, raising, cubs, females, give, birth, to, an, average, of, one, to, three, cubs, that, remain, with, their, mother, for, 1, 5, to, 4, 5, years, it, is, a, long, lived, animal, with, an, average, lifespan, of, 25, years, in, the, wild, relative, to, its, body, size, the, brown, bear, has, an, exceptionally, large, brain, for, a, land, carnivore, this, large, brain, allows, for, high, cognitive, abilities, such, as, tool, use, attacks, on, humans, though, widely, reported, are, generally, rare, while, the, brown, bear, s, range, has, shrunk, and, it, has, faced, local, extinctions, across, its, wide, range, it, remains, listed, as, a, least, concern, species, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, with, a, total, estimated, population, in, 2017, of, 110, 000, populations, that, were, hunted, to, extinction, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, are, the, atlas, bear, of, north, africa, and, the, californian, ungavan, and, mexican, populations, of, the, grizzly, bear, of, north, america, many, of, the, populations, in, the, southern, parts, of, eurasia, are, highly, endangered, as, well, one, of, the, smaller, bodied, forms, the, himalayan, brown, bear, is, critically, endangered, occupying, only, 2, of, its, former, range, and, threatened, by, uncontrolled, poaching, for, its, body, parts, the, marsican, brown, bear, of, central, italy, is, one, of, several, currently, isolated, populations, of, the, eurasian, brown, bear, and, is, believed, to, have, a, population, of, just, c, 50, bears, the, brown, bear, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, popular, of, the, world, s, charismatic, megafauna, it, has, been, kept, in, zoos, since, ancient, times, and, has, been, tamed, and, trained, to, perform, in, circuses, and, other, acts, for, thousands, of, years, the, brown, bear, has, found, a, predominant, role, in, human, culture, and, is, often, featured, in, literature, art, folklore, and, mythology, the, brown, bear, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, bruin, from, middle, english, this, name, originated, in, the, fable, history, of, reynard, the, fox, translated, by, william, caxton, from, middle, dutch, bruun, or, bruyn, meaning, brown, the, color, in, the, mid, 19th, century, united, states, the, brown, bear, was, termed, old, ephraim, and, sometimes, as, moccasin, joe, the, scientific, name, of, the, brown, bear, ursus, arctos, comes, from, the, latin, ursus, meaning, bear, and, the, greek, arktos, also, meaning, bear, carl, linnaeus, scientifically, described, the, species, under, the, name, ursus, arctos, in, the, 1758, edition, of, systema, naturae, brown, bear, taxonomy, and, subspecies, classification, has, been, described, as, formidable, and, confusing, with, few, authorities, listing, the, same, specific, set, of, subspecies, there, are, hundreds, of, obsolete, brown, bear, subspecies, as, many, as, 90, subspecies, have, been, proposed, a, 2008, dna, analysis, identified, as, few, as, five, main, clades, which, contain, all, extant, brown, bears, while, a, 2017, phylogenetic, study, revealed, nine, clades, including, one, representing, polar, bears, as, of, 2005, 15, extant, or, recently, extinct, subspecies, were, recognized, by, the, general, scientific, community, dna, analysis, shows, that, apart, from, recent, human, caused, population, fragmentation, brown, bears, in, north, america, are, generally, part, of, a, single, interconnected, population, system, with, the, exception, of, the, population, or, subspecies, in, the, kodiak, archipelago, which, has, probably, been, isolated, since, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, these, data, demonstrate, that, u, a, gyas, u, a, horribilis, u, a, sitkensis, and, u, a, stikeenensis, are, not, distinct, or, cohesive, groups, and, would, more, accurately, be, described, as, ecotypes, for, example, brown, bears, in, any, particular, region, of, the, alaska, coast, are, more, closely, related, to, adjacent, grizzly, bears, than, to, distant, populations, of, brown, bears, the, history, of, the, bears, of, the, alexander, archipelago, is, unusual, in, that, these, island, populations, carry, polar, bear, dna, presumably, originating, from, a, population, of, polar, bears, that, was, left, behind, at, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, but, have, since, been, connected, with, adjacent, mainland, populations, through, movement, of, males, to, the, point, where, their, nuclear, genomes, are, now, more, than, 90, of, brown, bear, ancestry, mtdna, analysis, revealed, that, brown, bears, are, apparently, divided, into, five, different, clades, some, of, which, coexist, or, co, occur, in, different, regions, the, brown, bear, is, one, of, eight, extant, species, in, the, bear, family, ursidae, and, of, six, extant, species, in, the, subfamily, ursinae, giant, panda, ailuropoda, melanoleuca, spectacled, bear, tremarctos, ornatus, sloth, bear, melursus, ursinus, sun, bear, helarctos, malayanus, asian, black, bear, ursus, thibetanus, american, black, bear, ursus, americanus, polar, bear, ursus,

bear, ursus, thibetanus, american, black, bear, ursus, americanus, polar, bear, ursus, maritimus, brown, bear, ursus, arctos, the, brown, bear, is, thought, to, have, evolved, from, the, etruscan, bear, ursus, etruscus, in, asia, during, the, early, pliocene, a, genetic, analysis, indicated, that, the, brown, bear, lineage, diverged, from, the, cave, bear, species, complex, approximately, 1, 2, 1, 4, million, years, ago, but, did, not, clarify, if, u, savini, persisted, as, a, paraspecies, for, the, brown, bear, before, perishing, the, oldest, brown, bear, fossils, occur, in, asia, from, about, 500, 000, to, 300, 000, years, ago, they, entered, europe, 250, 000, years, ago, and, north, africa, shortly, after, brown, bear, remains, from, the, pleistocene, period, are, common, in, the, british, isles, where, amongst, other, factors, they, may, have, contributed, to, the, extinction, of, cave, bears, ursus, spelaeus, brown, bears, first, emigrated, to, north, america, from, eurasia, via, beringia, during, the, illinoian, glaciation, genetic, evidence, suggests, several, brown, bear, populations, migrated, into, north, america, aligning, with, the, glacial, cycles, of, the, pleistocene, the, founding, population, of, most, north, american, brown, bears, arrived, first, with, the, genetic, lineage, developing, around, 177, 000, bp, genetic, divergences, suggest, brown, bears, first, migrated, south, during, mis, 5, 92, 000, 83, 000, bp, upon, the, opening, of, the, ice, free, corridor, after, a, local, extinction, in, beringia, 33, 000, bp, two, new, but, closely, related, lineages, repopulated, alaska, and, northern, canada, from, eurasia, after, the, last, glacial, maximum, 25, 000, bp, brown, bear, fossils, discovered, in, ontario, ohio, kentucky, and, labrador, show, that, the, species, occurred, farther, east, than, indicated, in, historic, records, in, north, america, two, types, of, the, subspecies, ursus, arctos, horribilis, are, generally, recognized, the, coastal, brown, bear, and, the, inland, grizzly, bear, a, grizzly, polar, bear, hybrid, is, a, rare, ursid, hybrid, resulting, from, a, crossbreeding, of, a, brown, bear, and, a, polar, bear, it, has, occurred, both, in, captivity, and, in, the, wild, in, 2006, the, occurrence, of, this, hybrid, was, confirmed, by, testing, the, dna, of, a, strange, looking, bear, that, had, been, shot, in, the, canadian, arctic, and, seven, more, hybrids, have, since, been, confirmed, in, the, same, region, all, descended, from, a, single, female, polar, bear, previously, the, hybrid, had, been, produced, in, zoos, and, was, considered, a, cryptid, a, hypothesized, animal, for, which, there, is, no, scientific, proof, of, existence, in, the, wild, analyses, of, the, genomes, of, bears, have, shown, that, introgression, between, species, was, widespread, during, the, evolution, of, the, genus, ursus, including, the, introgression, of, polar, bear, dna, introduced, to, brown, bears, during, the, pleistocene, the, brown, bear, is, the, most, variable, in, size, of, modern, bears, the, typical, size, depends, upon, which, population, it, is, from, and, most, accepted, subtypes, vary, widely, in, size, this, is, in, part, due, to, sexual, dimorphism, as, male, brown, bears, average, at, least, 30, larger, in, most, subtypes, individual, bears, vary, in, size, seasonally, weighing, the, least, in, spring, due, to, lack, of, foraging, during, hibernation, and, the, most, in, late, fall, after, a, period, of, hyperphagia, to, put, on, additional, weight, to, prepare, for, hibernation, brown, bears, generally, weigh, 80, to, 600, kg, 180, to, 1, 320, lb, with, males, outweighing, females, they, have, a, head, and, body, length, of, 1, 4, to, 2, 8, m, 4, ft, 7, in, to, 9, ft, 2, in, and, a, shoulder, height, of, 70, to, 153, cm, 28, to, 60, in, the, tail, is, relatively, short, as, in, all, bears, ranging, from, 6, to, 22, cm, 2, 4, to, 8, 7, in, in, length, the, smallest, brown, bears, females, during, spring, among, barren, ground, populations, can, weigh, so, little, as, to, roughly, match, the, body, mass, of, males, of, the, smallest, living, bear, species, the, sun, bear, helarctos, malayanus, while, the, largest, coastal, populations, attain, sizes, broadly, similar, to, those, of, the, largest, living, bear, species, the, polar, bear, interior, brown, bears, are, generally, smaller, than, is, often, perceived, being, around, the, same, weight, as, an, average, lion, at, an, average, of, 180, kg, 400, lb, in, males, and, 135, kg, 298, lb, in, females, whereas, adults, of, the, coastal, populations, weigh, about, twice, as, much, the, average, weight, of, adult, male, bears, from, 19, populations, was, found, to, be, 217, kg, 478, lb, while, adult, females, from, 24, populations, were, found, to, average, 152, kg, 335, lb, brown, bears, are, often, not, fully, brown, they, have, long, thick, fur, with, a, moderately, elongated, mane, at, the, back, of, the, neck, which, varies, somewhat, across, the, types, in, india, brown, bears, can, be, reddish, with, silver, tipped, hairs, while, in, china, brown, bears, are, bicolored, with, a, yellowish, brown, or, whitish, collar, across, the, neck, chest, and, shoulders, even, within, well, defined, subspecies, individuals, may, show, highly, variable, hues, of, brown, north, american, grizzlies, can, be, dark, brown, almost, black, to, cream, almost, white, or, yellowish, brown, and, often, have, darker, colored, legs, the, common, name, grizzly, stems, from, their, typical, coloration, with, the, hairs, on, their, back, usually, being, brownish, black, at, the, base, and, whitish, cream, at, the, tips, giving, them, their, distinctive, grizzled, color, apart, from, the, cinnamon, subspecies, of, the, american, black, bear, u, americanus, cinnamonum, the, brown, bear, is, the, only, modern, bear, species, to, typically, appear, truly, brown, the, winter, fur, is, very, thick, and, long, especially, in, northern, subspecies, and, can, reach, 11, to, 12, cm, 4, 3, to, 4, 7, in, at, the, withers, the, winter, hairs, are, thin, yet, rough, to, the, touch, the, summer, fur, is, much, shorter, and, sparser, with, its, length, and, density, varying, geographically, adults, have, massive, heavily, built, concave, skulls, which, are, large, in, proportion, to, the, body, the, projections, of, the, skull, are, well, developed, skull, lengths, of, russian, brown, bears, tend, to, be, 31, 5, to, 45, 5, cm, 12, 4, to, 17, 9, in, for, males, and, 27, 5, to, 39, 7, cm, 10, 8, to, 15, 6, in, for, females, the, width, of, the, zygomatic, arches, in, males, is, 17, 5, to, 27, 7, cm, 6, 9, to, 10, 9, in, and, 14, 7, to, 24, 7, cm, 5, 8, to, 9, 7, in, in, females, brown, bears, have, strong, jaws, the, incisors, and, canine, teeth, are, large, with, the, lower, canines, being, strongly, curved, the, first, three, molars, of, the, upper, jaw, are, underdeveloped, and, single, crowned, with, one, root, the, second, upper, molar, is, smaller, than, the, others, and, is, usually, absent, in, adults, it, is, usually, lost, at, an, early, age, leaving, no, trace, of, the, alveolus, in, the, jaw, the, first, three, molars, of, the, lower, jaw, are, very, weak, and, are, often, lost, at, an, early, age, the, teeth, of, brown, bears, reflect, their, dietary, plasticity, and, are, broadly, similar, to, other, bears, they, are, reliably, larger, than, american, black, bears, but, average, smaller, in, molar, length, than, polar, bears, brown, bears, have, the, broadest, skull, of, any, extant, ursine, bear, brown, bears, have, large, curved, claws, with, the, front, ones, being, larger, than, the, back, they, may, reach, 5, to, 6, cm, 2, 0, to, 2, 4, in, and, measure, 7, to, 10, cm, 2, 8, to, 3, 9, in, along, the, curve, compared, with, the, american, black, bear, ursus, americanus, the, brown, bear, has, longer, and, stronger, claws, with, a, blunt, curve, due, to, their, claw, structure, in, addition, to, their, excessive, weight, adult, brown, bears, are, not, able, to, climb, trees, as, well, as, black, bears, in, rare, cases, adult, female, brown, bears, have, been, seen, scaling, trees, the, claws, of, a, polar, bear, are, quite, different, being, notably, shorter, but, broader, with, a, strong, curve, and, sharper, point, the, species, has, large, paws, the, rear, feet, measures, 21, to, 36, cm, 8, 3, to, 14, 2, in, long, while, the, forefeet, tend, to, measure, 40, less, brown, bears, are, the, only, extant, bears, with, a, hump, at, the, top, of, their, shoulder, which, is, made, entirely, of, muscle, this, feature, having, developed, presumably, for, imparting, more, force, in, digging, helps, during, foraging, and, is, used, heavily, in, den, construction, prior, to, hibernation, brown, bears, were, once, native, to, europe, much, of, asia, the, atlas, mountains, of, africa, and, north, america, but, are, now, extirpated, in, some, areas, and, their, populations, have, greatly, decreased, in, other, areas, there, are, approximately, 200, 000, brown, bears, left, in, the, world, the, largest, populations, are, in, russia, with, 130, 000, the, united, states, with, 32, 500, and, canada, with, around, 25, 000, brown, bears, live, in, alaska, east, through, the, yukon, and, northwest, territories, south, through, british, columbia, and, through, the, western, half, of, alberta, the, alaskan, population, is, estimated, at, a, healthy, 30, 000, individuals, in, the, lower, 48, states, they, are, repopulating, slowly, but, steadily, along, the, rockies, and, the, western, great, plains, in, europe, in, 2010, there, were, 14, 000, brown, bears, in, ten, fragmented, populations, from, spain, estimated, at, only, 20, 25, animals, in, the, pyrenees, in, 2010, in, a, range, shared, between, spain, france, and, andorra, and, some, 210, animals, in, asturias, cantabria, galicia, and, le, n, in, the, picos, de, europa, and, adjacent, areas, in, 2013, in, the, west, to, russia, in, the, east, and, from, sweden, and, finland, in, the, north, to, romania, 5, 000, 6, 000, bulgaria, 900, 1, 200, slovakia, with, about, 600, 800, animals, slovenia, 500, 700, animals, and, greece, with, karamanlidis, et, al, 2015, estimating, 450, animals, in, the, south, in, asia, brown, bears, are, found, primarily, throughout, russia, thence, more, spottily, southwest, to, parts, of, the, middle, east, including, the, eastern, black, sea, region, turkey, that, has, 5, 432, individuals, of, brown, bear, to, as, far, south, as, southwestern, iran, and, to, the, southeast, in, northeast, china, brown, bears, are, also, found, in, western, china, kyrgyzstan, north, korea, pakistan, afghanistan, and, india, a, population, of, brown, bear, can, be, found, on, the, japanese, island, of, hokkaid, which, holds, the, largest, number, of, non, russian, brown, bears, in, eastern, asia, with, about, 2, 000, 3, 000, animals, this, species, inhabits, the, broadest, range, of, habitats, of, any, living, bear, species, they, seem, to, have, no, altitudinal, preferences, and, have, been, recorded, from, sea, level, to, an, elevation, of, 5, 000, m, 16, 000, ft, in, the, himalayas, in, most, of, their, range, brown, bears, seem, to, prefer, semiopen, country, with, a, scattering, of, vegetation, that, can, allow, them, a, resting, spot, during, the, day, however, they, have, been, recorded, as, inhabiting, every, variety, of, northern, temperate, forest, known, to, occur, while, the, brown, bear, s, range, has, shrunk, and, it, has, faced, local, extinctions, it, remains, listed, as, a, least, concern, species, by, the, iucn, with, a, total, population, of, approximately, 200, 000, as, of, 2012, this, and, the, american, black, bear, are, the, only, bear, species, not, classified, as, threatened, by, the, iucn, however, the, california, grizzly, bear, ungava, brown, bear, atlas, bear, and, mexican, grizzly, bear, as, well, as, brown, bear, populations, in, the, pacific, northwest, were, hunted, to, extinction, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, and, many, of, the, southern, asian, subspecies, are, highly, endangered, the, syrian, brown, bear, u, a, syriacus, is, very, rare, and, it, has, been, extirpated, from, more, than, half, of, its, historic, range, one, of, the, smallest, bodied, subspecies, the, himalayan, brown, bear, u, a, isabellinus, is, critically, endangered, occupying, only, 2, of, its, former, range, and, threatened, by, uncontrolled, poaching, for, its, body, parts, the, marsican, brown, bear, in, central, italy, is, believed, to, have, a, population, of, just, 50, bears, the, smallest, populations, are, most, vulnerable, to, habitat, loss, and, fragmentation, whereas, the, largest, are, primarily, threatened, by, overhunting, the, use, of, land, for, agriculture, may, negatively, effect, brown, bears, additionally, roads, and, railway, tracks, could, pose, a, serious, threat, as, in, coming, vehicles, may, collide, with, crossing, animals, poaching, has, been, cited, as, another, mortality, factor, a, 3, year, long, survey, in, the, russian, far, east, detected, the, illegal, shipping, of, brown, bear, cholecyst, to, southeast, asian, countries, the, purpose, and, motive, behind, the, trade, is, unknown, an, action, plan, in, 2000, aimed, to, conserve, brown, bears, in, europe, by, mitigating, human, wildlife, conflict, educating, farm, owners, on, sustainable, practices, and, preserving, expanding, remaining, forests, compensations, were, given, to, people, who, suffered, losses, in, livestock, food, supplies, or, shelters, growing, populations, were, recorded, in, some, countries, such, as, sweden, where, an, increase, of, 1, 5, per, annum, occurred, between, the, 1940s, and, 1990s, brown, bears, in, central, asia, are, primarily, threatened, by, climate, change, conservationists, plan, on, building, wildlife, corridors, to, promote, easy, access, from, one, brown, bear, population, to, another, in, himalayan, nepal, farmers, may, kill, brown, bears, in, revenge, for, livestock, predation, a, 2014, study, revealed, that, brown, bears, peaked, in, activity, around, the, morning, and, early, evening, hours, although, activity, can, happen, day, or, night, bears, who, live, in, locations, with, higher, levels, of, human, interaction, are, more, likely, to, be, fully, nocturnal, in, low, disturbance, areas, many, adult, bears, are, primarily, crepuscular, while, yearlings, and, newly, independent, bears, appear, to, be, most, active, throughout, the, day, in, summer, through, autumn, a, brown, bear, can, double, its, weight, from, the, spring, gaining, up, to, 180, kg, 400, lb, of, fat, on, which, it, relies, to, make, it, through, winter, when, it, becomes, lethargic, although, they, are, not, full, hibernators, and, can, be, woken, easily, both, sexes, prefer, to, den, in, a, protected, spot, during, the, winter, months, hibernation, dens, may, consist, of, any, spot, that, provides, cover, from, the, elements, and, that, can, accommodate, their, bodies, such, as, a, cave, crevice, cavernous, tree, roots, or, hollow, logs, brown, bears, have, one, of, the, largest, brains, of, any, extant, carnivoran, relative, to, their, body, size, and, have, been, shown, to, engage, in, tool, use, which, requires, advanced, cognitive, abilities, this, species, is, mostly, solitary, although, bears, may, gather, in, large, numbers, at, major, food, sources, e, g, open, garbage, dumps, or, rivers, holding, spawning, salmon, and, form, social, hierarchies, based, on, age, and, size, adult, male, bears, are, particularly, aggressive, and, are, avoided, by, adolescent, and, subadult, males, both, at, concentrated, feeding, opportunities, and, chance, encounters, females, with, cubs, rival, adult, males, in, aggression, and, are, much, more, intolerant, of, other, bears, than, single, females, young, adolescent, males, tend, to, be, least, aggressive, and, have, been, observed, in, nonantagonistic, interactions, with, each, other, dominance, between, bears, is, asserted, by, making, a, frontal, orientation, showing, off, canines, muzzle, twisting, and, neck, stretching, to, which, a, subordinate, will, respond, with, a, lateral, orientation, by, turning, away, and, dropping, the, head, and, by, sitting, or, lying, down, during, combat, bears, use, their, paws, to, strike, their, opponents, in, the, chest, or, shoulders, and, bite, the, head, or, neck, several, different, facial, expressions, have, been, documented, in, brown, bears, the, relaxed, face, is, made, in, everyday, activities, and, has, the, ears, pointed, to, the, sides, and, the, mouth, closed, or, slackly, open, during, social, play, bears, make, relaxed, open, mouth, face, in, which, the, mouth, is, open, with, a, curled, upper, lip, and, hanging, lower, lip, and, the, ears, alert, and, shifting, when, looking, at, another, animal, at, a, distance, the, bear, makes, an, alert, face, as, the, ears, are,

occurs, when, the, bear, feels, threatened, when, approached, by, another, individual, the, animal, makes, a, puckered, lip, face, with, a, protruding, upper, lip, and, ears, which, go, from, cocked, and, alert, when, at, a, certain, distance, to, laid, back, when, closer, or, when, retreating, the, jaw, gape, face, consists, of, an, open, mouth, with, visible, lower, canines, and, hanging, lips, while, the, biting, face, is, similar, to, the, relaxed, open, mouth, face, except, the, ears, are, flattened, and, the, eyes, are, wide, enough, to, expose, the, sclera, both, the, jaw, gape, face, and, the, biting, face, are, made, in, aggression, and, bears, switch, between, them, brown, bears, also, produce, various, vocalizations, huffing, occurs, when, the, animal, is, tense, while, woofing, is, made, when, alarmed, both, sounds, are, produced, by, exhalations, though, huffing, is, harsher, and, is, made, continuously, two, per, second, growls, and, roars, are, made, in, aggression, growling, is, harsh, and, guttural, and, can, range, from, a, simple, grrr, to, a, rumble, a, rumbling, growl, can, escalate, into, a, roar, when, the, bear, is, charging, roaring, is, described, as, thunderous, and, can, travel, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, mothers, and, cubs, wanting, physical, contact, will, bawl, which, is, heard, as, waugh, waugh, brown, bears, usually, occur, over, vast, home, ranges, however, they, are, not, highly, territorial, several, adult, bears, roam, freely, over, the, same, vicinity, without, issue, unless, rights, to, a, fertile, female, or, food, sources, are, being, contested, despite, their, lack, of, traditional, territorial, behavior, adult, males, seem, to, have, a, personal, zone, in, which, other, bears, are, not, tolerated, if, they, are, seen, males, always, wander, further, than, females, due, to, both, increasing, access, to, females, and, food, sources, while, females, are, advantaged, by, smaller, territories, in, part, since, it, decreases, the, likelihood, of, encounters, with, male, bears, who, may, endanger, their, cubs, in, areas, where, food, is, abundant, such, as, coastal, alaska, home, ranges, for, females, and, males, are, up, to, 24, km, 2, 9, 3, sq, mi, and, 89, km, 2, 34, sq, mi, respectively, similarly, in, british, columbia, bears, of, the, two, sexes, travel, relatively, compact, home, ranges, of, 115, and, 318, km, 2, 44, and, 123, sq, mi, in, yellowstone, national, park, home, ranges, for, females, are, up, to, 281, km, 2, 108, sq, mi, and, up, to, 874, km, 2, 337, sq, mi, for, males, in, romania, the, largest, home, range, was, recorded, for, adult, males, 3, 143, km, 2, 1, 214, sq, mi, in, the, central, arctic, of, canada, where, food, sources, are, quite, sparse, home, ranges, range, up, to, 2, 434, km, 2, 940, sq, mi, in, females, and, 8, 171, km, 2, 3, 155, sq, mi, in, males, the, mating, season, occurs, from, mid, may, to, early, july, shifting, later, the, further, north, the, bears, are, found, being, serially, monogamous, brown, bears, remain, with, the, same, mate, for, a, couple, of, days, to, a, couple, of, weeks, outside, of, this, narrow, time, frame, adult, male, and, female, brown, bears, show, no, sexual, interest, in, each, other, females, mature, sexually, between, the, ages, of, four, and, eight, males, first, mate, about, a, year, later, when, they, are, large, and, strong, enough, to, compete, with, other, males, for, mating, rights, males, will, try, to, mate, with, as, many, females, as, they, can, usually, a, successful, one, mates, with, two, females, in, a, span, of, one, to, three, weeks, the, adult, female, brown, bear, is, similarly, promiscuous, mating, with, up, to, four, sometimes, even, eight, males, while, in, heat, and, potentially, breeding, with, two, in, a, single, day, females, come, into, oestrus, every, three, to, four, years, with, a, full, range, of, 2, 4, to, 5, 7, years, the, urine, markings, of, a, female, in, oestrus, can, attract, several, males, via, scent, dominant, males, may, try, to, sequester, a, female, for, her, entire, oestrus, period, of, approximately, two, weeks, but, usually, are, unable, to, retain, her, for, the, entire, time, copulation, is, prolonged, and, lasts, over, 20, minutes, males, take, no, part, in, raising, cubs, parenting, is, left, entirely, to, the, females, through, the, process, of, delayed, implantation, a, female, s, fertilized, egg, divides, and, floats, freely, in, the, uterus, for, six, months, during, winter, dormancy, the, fetus, attaches, to, the, uterine, wall, the, cubs, are, born, eight, weeks, later, while, the, mother, sleeps, if, the, mother, does, not, gain, enough, weight, to, survive, through, the, winter, while, gestating, the, embryo, does, not, implant, and, is, reabsorbed, into, the, body, litters, consist, of, as, many, as, six, cubs, though, litters, of, one, to, three, are, more, typical, there, are, records, of, females, sometimes, adopting, stray, cubs, or, even, trading, or, kidnapping, cubs, when, they, emerge, from, hibernation, a, larger, female, may, claim, cubs, from, a, smaller, one, older, and, larger, females, within, a, population, tend, to, give, birth, to, larger, litters, the, size, of, a, litter, also, depends, on, factors, such, as, geographic, location, and, food, supply, at, birth, cubs, are, blind, toothless, and, hairless, and, may, weigh, 350, to, 510, g, 0, 77, to, 1, 12, lb, they, feed, on, their, mother, s, milk, until, spring, or, early, summer, depending, on, climate, conditions, at, this, time, the, cubs, weigh, 7, to, 9, kg, 15, to, 20, lb, and, have, developed, enough, to, follow, and, forage, for, solid, food, with, their, mother, over, long, distances, the, cubs, are, fully, dependent, on, the, mother, and, a, close, bond, is, formed, during, the, dependency, stage, the, cubs, learn, rather, than, inherit, as, instincts, from, birth, survival, techniques, such, as, which, foods, have, the, highest, nutritional, value, and, where, to, obtain, them, how, to, hunt, fish, and, defend, themselves, and, where, to, den, increased, brain, size, in, large, carnivores, has, been, positively, linked, to, whether, a, given, species, is, solitary, as, is, the, brown, bear, or, raises, their, offspring, communally, thus, female, brown, bears, have, relatively, large, well, developed, brains, presumably, key, in, teaching, behavior, the, cubs, learn, by, following, and, imitating, their, mother, s, actions, during, the, period, they, are, with, her, cubs, remain, with, their, mother, for, an, average, of, 2, 5, years, in, north, america, and, gain, independence, from, as, early, as, 1, 5, years, of, age, to, as, late, as, 4, 5, years, the, stage, at, which, independence, is, attained, may, generally, be, earlier, in, some, parts, of, eurasia, as, the, latest, date, which, mother, and, cubs, were, together, was, 2, 3, years, most, families, separated, in, under, two, years, in, a, study, from, hokkaido, and, in, sweden, most, cubs, on, their, own, were, still, yearlings, brown, bears, practice, infanticide, as, an, adult, male, bear, may, kill, the, cubs, of, another, when, an, adult, male, brown, bear, kills, a, cub, it, is, usually, because, he, is, trying, to, bring, the, female, into, oestrus, as, she, will, enter, that, state, within, two, to, four, days, after, the, death, of, her, cubs, cubs, may, flee, up, a, tree, when, they, see, a, strange, male, bear, approaching, the, mother, often, successfully, defends, them, even, though, the, male, may, be, twice, as, heavy, as, her, however, females, have, been, known, to, die, in, such, confrontations, the, brown, bear, is, one, of, the, most, omnivorous, animals, and, has, been, recorded, as, consuming, the, greatest, variety, of, foods, of, any, bear, despite, their, reputation, most, brown, bears, are, not, highly, carnivorous, as, they, derive, up, to, 90, of, their, dietary, food, energy, from, vegetable, matter, they, often, feed, on, a, variety, of, plant, life, including, berries, grasses, flowers, acorns, and, pine, cones, as, well, as, fungi, such, as, mushrooms, among, all, bears, brown, bears, are, uniquely, equipped, to, dig, for, tough, foods, such, as, roots, bulbs, and, shoots, they, use, their, long, strong, claws, to, dig, out, earth, to, reach, the, roots, and, their, powerful, jaws, to, bite, through, them, in, spring, winter, provided, carrion, grasses, shoots, sedges, moss, and, forbs, are, the, dietary, mainstays, for, brown, bears, internationally, fruits, including, berries, become, increasingly, important, during, summer, and, early, autumn, roots, and, bulbs, become, critical, in, autumn, for, some, inland, bear, populations, if, fruit, crops, are, poor, they, will, also, commonly, consume, animal, matter, which, in, summer, and, autumn, may, regularly, be, in, the, form, of, insects, larvae, and, grubs, including, beehives, bears, in, yellowstone, eat, an, enormous, number, of, moths, during, the, summer, sometimes, as, many, as, 40, 000, army, cutworm, moths, in, a, single, day, and, may, derive, up, to, half, of, their, annual, food, energy, from, these, insects, brown, bears, living, near, coastal, regions, will, regularly, eat, crabs, and, clams, in, alaska, bears, along, the, beaches, of, estuaries, regularly, dig, through, the, sand, for, clams, this, species, may, eat, birds, and, their, eggs, including, almost, entirely, ground, or, rock, nesting, species, the, diet, may, be, supplemented, by, rodents, or, similar, smallish, mammals, including, marmots, ground, squirrels, mice, rats, lemmings, and, voles, with, particular, regularity, bears, in, denali, national, park, will, wait, at, burrows, of, arctic, ground, squirrels, hoping, to, pick, off, a, few, of, the, 1, kg, 2, 2, lb, rodents, in, the, kamchatka, peninsula, and, several, parts, of, coastal, alaska, brown, bears, feed, mostly, on, spawning, salmon, whose, nutrition, and, abundance, explain, the, enormous, size, of, the, bears, in, these, areas, the, fishing, techniques, of, bears, are, well, documented, they, often, congregate, around, falls, when, the, salmon, are, forced, to, breach, the, water, at, which, point, the, bears, will, try, to, catch, the, fish, in, mid, air, often, with, their, mouths, they, will, also, wade, into, shallow, waters, hoping, to, pin, a, slippery, salmon, with, their, claws, while, they, may, eat, almost, all, the, parts, of, the, fish, bears, at, the, peak, of, spawning, when, there, is, usually, a, glut, of, fish, to, feed, on, may, eat, only, the, most, nutrious, parts, of, the, salmon, including, the, eggs, and, head, and, then, indifferently, leave, the, rest, of, the, carcass, to, scavengers, which, can, include, red, foxes, bald, eagles, common, ravens, and, gulls, despite, their, normally, solitary, habits, brown, bears, will, gather, rather, closely, in, numbers, at, good, spawning, sites, the, largest, and, most, powerful, males, claim, the, most, fruitful, fishing, spots, and, bears, especially, males, will, sometimes, fight, over, the, rights, to, a, prime, fishing, spot, beyond, the, regular, predation, of, salmon, most, brown, bears, are, not, particularly, active, predators, while, perhaps, a, majority, of, bears, of, the, species, will, charge, at, large, prey, at, one, point, in, their, lives, and, most, eat, carrion, many, predation, attempts, start, with, the, bear, clumsily, and, half, heartedly, pursuing, the, prey, and, end, with, the, prey, escaping, alive, on, the, other, hand, some, brown, bears, are, quite, self, assured, predators, who, habitually, pursue, and, catch, large, prey, items, such, bears, are, usually, taught, how, to, hunt, by, their, mothers, from, an, early, age, large, mammals, preyed, on, can, include, various, ungulate, species, such, as, elk, moose, caribou, muskoxen, and, wild, boar, when, brown, bears, attack, these, large, animals, they, usually, target, young, or, infirm, ones, as, they, are, easier, to, catch, typically, when, hunting, especially, with, young, prey, the, bear, pins, its, prey, to, the, ground, and, then, immediately, tears, and, eats, it, alive, it, will, also, bite, or, swipe, some, prey, to, stun, it, enough, to, knock, it, over, for, consumption, to, pick, out, young, or, infirm, individuals, bears, will, charge, at, herds, so, the, slower, moving, and, more, vulnerable, individuals, will, be, made, apparent, brown, bears, may, ambush, young, animals, by, finding, them, via, scent, when, emerging, from, hibernation, brown, bears, whose, broad, paws, allow, them, to, walk, over, most, ice, and, snow, may, pursue, large, prey, such, as, moose, whose, hooves, cannot, support, them, on, encrusted, snow, similarly, predatory, attacks, on, large, prey, sometimes, occur, at, riverbeds, when, it, is, more, difficult, for, the, prey, specimen, to, run, away, due, to, muddy, or, slippery, soil, on, rare, occasions, while, confronting, fully, grown, dangerous, prey, bears, kill, them, by, hitting, with, their, powerful, forearms, which, can, break, the, necks, and, backs, of, large, creatures, such, as, adult, moose, and, adult, bison, they, feed, on, carrion, and, use, their, size, to, intimidate, other, predators, such, as, wolves, cougars, tigers, and, american, black, bears, from, their, kills, carrion, is, especially, important, in, the, early, spring, when, the, bears, are, emerging, from, hibernation, much, of, it, comprising, winter, killed, big, game, cannibalism, is, not, unheard, of, though, predation, is, not, normally, believed, to, be, the, primary, motivation, when, brown, bears, attack, each, other, when, forced, to, live, in, close, proximity, with, humans, and, their, domesticated, animals, bears, may, potentially, predate, any, type, of, domestic, animal, among, these, domestic, cattle, are, sometimes, exploited, as, prey, cattle, are, bitten, on, the, neck, back, or, head, and, then, the, abdominal, cavity, is, opened, for, eating, plants, and, fruit, farmed, by, humans, are, readily, consumed, as, well, including, corn, wheat, sorghum, melons, and, any, form, of, berries, they, may, feed, on, domestic, bee, yards, readily, consuming, both, honey, and, the, brood, grubs, and, pupae, of, the, honey, bee, colony, human, foods, and, trash, are, eaten, when, possible, when, an, open, garbage, dump, was, kept, in, yellowstone, brown, bears, were, one, of, the, most, voracious, and, regular, scavengers, the, dump, was, closed, after, both, brown, and, american, black, bears, came, to, associate, humans, with, food, and, lost, their, natural, fear, of, them, adult, bears, are, generally, immune, to, predatory, attacks, except, from, large, siberian, amur, tigers, and, other, bears, following, a, decrease, of, ungulate, populations, from, 1944, to, 1959, 32, cases, of, siberian, tigers, attacking, both, ussuri, brown, bears, ursus, arctos, lasiotus, and, ussuri, black, bears, u, thibetanus, ussuricus, were, recorded, in, the, russian, far, east, and, hair, of, bears, were, found, in, several, tiger, scat, samples, tigers, attack, black, bears, less, often, than, brown, bears, since, the, brown, bears, live, in, more, open, habitats, and, are, not, able, to, climb, trees, in, the, same, time, period, four, cases, of, brown, bears, killing, female, tigers, and, young, cubs, were, reported, both, in, disputes, over, prey, and, in, self, defense, in, rare, cases, when, amur, tigers, prey, on, brown, bears, they, usually, target, young, and, sub, adult, bears, besides, small, female, adults, taken, outside, their, dens, generally, when, lethargic, from, hibernation, predation, by, tigers, on, denned, brown, bears, was, not, detected, during, a, study, carried, between, 1993, and, 2002, ussuri, brown, bears, along, with, the, smaller, black, bears, constitute, 2, 1, of, the, siberian, tiger, s, annual, diet, of, which, 1, 4, are, brown, bears, brown, bears, regularly, intimidate, wolves, to, drive, them, away, from, their, kills, in, yellowstone, national, park, bears, pirate, wolf, kills, so, often, yellowstone, s, wolf, project, director, doug, smith, wrote, it, s, not, a, matter, of, if, the, bears, will, come, calling, after, a, kill, but, when, despite, the, high, animosity, between, the, two, species, most, confrontations, at, kill, sites, or, large, carcasses, end, without, bloodshed, on, either, side, though, conflict, over, carcasses, is, common, on, rare, occasions, the, two, predators, tolerate, each, other, on, the, same, kill, to, date, there, is, a, single, recorded, case, of, fully, grown, wolves, being, killed, by, a, grizzly, bear, given, the, opportunity, however, both, species, will, prey, on, the, other, s, cubs, in, some, areas, grizzly, bears, regularly, displace, cougars, from, their, kills, cougars, kill, small, bear, cubs, on, rare, occasions, but, there, was, one, report, of, a, bear, killing, a, cougar, of, unknown, age, and, condition, between, 1993, and, 1996, brown, bears, usually, dominate, other, bear, species, in, areas, where, they, coexist, due, to, their, smaller, size, american, black, bears, are, at, a, competitive, disadvantage, to, grizzly, bears, in, open, unforested, areas, although, displacement, of, black, bears, by, grizzly, bears, has, been, documented, actual, interspecific, killing, of, black, bears, by, grizzlies, has, only, occasionally, been, reported, confrontation, is, mostly, avoided, due, to, the, black, bear, s, diurnal, habits, and, preference, for, heavily, forested, areas, as, opposed, to, the, grizzly, s, largely, nocturnal, habits, and, preference, for, open, spaces, brown, bears, may, also, kill, asian, black, bears, though, the, latter, species, probably, largely, avoids, conflicts, with, the, brown, bear, due, to, similar, habits, and, habitat, preferences, to, the, american, black, species, as, of, the, 21st, century, there, has, been, an, increase, in, interactions, between, brown, bears, and, polar, bears, theorized, to, be, caused, by, climate, change, brown, and, grizzly, bears, have, been, seen, moving, increasingly, northward, into, territories, formerly, claimed, by, polar, bears, they, tend, to, dominate, polar, bears, in, disputes, over, carcasses, and, dead, polar, bear, cubs, have, been, found, in, brown, bear, dens, the, brown, bear, has, a, naturally, long, life, wild, females, have, been, observed, reproducing, at, 28, years, which, is, the, oldest, known, age, for, reproduction, of, any, ursid, in, the, wild, the, peak, reproductive, age, for, females, ranges, from, four, to, 20, years, old, the, lifespan, of, both, sexes, within, minimally, hunted, populations, is, estimated, at, an, average, of, 25, years, the, oldest, recorded, wild, individual, was, nearly, 37, years, old, in, captivity, the, oldest, recorded, female, was, around, 40, years, old, while, males, have, been, verified, to, live, up, to, 47, years, while, male, bears, potentially, live, longer, in, captivity, female, grizzly, bears, have, a, greater, annual, survival, rate, than, males, within, wild, populations, per, a, study, done, in, the, greater, yellowstone, ecosystem, annual, mortality, for, bears, of, any, age, is, estimated, at, 10, in, most, protected, areas, around, 13, to, 44, of, cubs, die, within, their, first, year, beyond, predation, by, large, predators, including, wolves, siberian, tigers, and, other, brown, bears, starvation, and, accidents, also, claim, the, lives, of, cubs, studies, have, indicated, that, the, most, prevalent, source, of, mortality, for, first, year, cubs, is, malnutrition, brown, bears, are, susceptible, to, parasites, such, as, flukes, ticks, tapeworms, roundworms, and, biting, lice, it, is, thought, that, brown, bears, may, catch, canine, distemper, virus, cdv, from, other, caniforms, like, stray, dogs, and, wolves, a, captive, individual, allegedly, succumbed, to, aujeszky, s, disease, a, study, conducted, by, the, brown, bear, research, project, did, a, proteomic, analysis, of, the, brown, bear, s, blood, organs, and, tissues, to, pinpoint, proteins, and, peptides, that, either, increased, or, decreased, in, expression, in, the, winter, and, summer, months, one, major, finding, was, that, the, plasma, protein, sex, hormone, binding, globulin, shbg, increased, during, the, brown, bear, s, hibernation, period, by, 45, times, although, scientists, do, not, yet, understand, the, role, of, shbg, in, maintaining, the, brown, bear, s, health, some, believe, these, findings, could, potentially, be, a, factor, in, preventing, human, diseases, that, come, from, a, sedentary, life, style, brown, bears, usually, avoid, areas, where, extensive, development, or, urbanization, has, occurred, they, rarely, attack, on, sight, and, usually, avoid, people, they, are, however, unpredictable, in, temperament, and, may, attack, if, threatened, or, surprised, mothers, defending, cubs, are, the, most, prone, to, attacking, being, responsible, for, 70, of, brown, bear, caused, human, fatalities, in, north, america, attacks, tend, to, result, in, serious, injury, and, in, some, cases, death, due, to, the, bears, enormous, physical, strength, a, single, bite, or, swipe, can, be, deadly, violent, encounters, with, brown, bears, usually, last, a, few, minutes, though, they, can, be, prolonged, if, the, victims, fight, back, a, study, conducted, in, 2019, found, that, 664, bear, attacks, were, reported, during, a, 15, year, period, 2000, 2015, throughout, north, america, and, eurasia, there, were, 568, injuries, and, 95, casualties, around, 10, people, a, year, are, killed, by, brown, bears, in, russia, more, than, all, the, other, parts, of, the, brown, bear, s, range, combined, in, japan, a, large, brown, bear, nicknamed, kesagake, kesa, style, slasher, caused, the, worst, brown, bear, attack, in, japanese, history, at, tomamae, hokkaid, during, numerous, encounters, during, december, 1915, it, killed, seven, people, and, wounded, three, others, before, being, gunned, down, after, a, large, scale, beast, hunt, a, study, by, u, s, and, canadian, researchers, has, found, bear, spray, to, be, more, effective, at, stopping, aggressive, bear, behavior, than, guns, working, in, 92, of, studied, incidents, versus, 67, for, guns, humans, have, been, recorded, hunting, brown, bears, for, over, 10, 300, 9, 300, years, in, europe, between, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, humans, sought, to, control, brown, bear, numbers, by, awarding, those, who, managed, to, kill, one, this, bounty, scheme, pushed, the, brown, bear, population, to, the, brink, of, extinction, before, comprehensive, protection, was, offered, in, the, 1900s, despite, this, a, 2018, study, found, hunting, to, be, one, of, the, contributing, factors, to, the, drop, in, brown, bear, numbers, in, northern, europe, the, earliest, known, case, of, a, european, killing, a, grizzly, bear, dates, back, to, 1691, their, arrival, in, western, united, states, led, to, the, extirpation, of, local, brown, bear, populations, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, during, the, early, years, of, european, settlement, in, north, america, bears, were, usually, killed, with, a, spear, or, lasso, rope, the, introduction, of, rifles, in, the, mid, 19th, century, largely, facilitated, bear, hunts, which, allowed, for, an, increasing, trend, bears, were, also, pitted, into, fights, against, male, cattle, often, ending, with, either, animal, grievously, injured, or, dead, the, last, two, decades, of, the, 19th, century, saw, an, increase, in, bounties, conflicts, with, farmers, also, contributed, to, its, rapid, decline, it, wasn, t, until, the, 1920s, that, grizzly, bears, received, some, type, of, protection, from, the, us, government, today, brown, bears, are, legally, hunted, in, some, american, states, such, as, alaska, however, a, hunting, license, is, required, and, killings, of, females, with, cubs, will, result, in, a, prison, sentence, their, meat, is, sometimes, consumed, and, used, in, recipes, such, as, dumplings, hams, and, stews, the, indigenous, people, of, james, bay, eastern, cree, use, their, flesh, in, traditional, dishes, in, asia, and, romania, the, paws, are, consumed, as, exotic, delectables, brown, bear, paws, have, been, a, prevalent, component, of, traditional, chinese, food, since, 500, bc, the, total, weight, of, commercially, sold, brown, bear, meat, is, estimated, at, 17, tons, annually, bears, have, been, recorded, in, captivity, as, early,
