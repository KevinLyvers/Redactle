medical, diagnosis, abbreviated, dx, d, x, or, d, s, is, the, process, of, determining, which, disease, or, condition, explains, a, person, s, symptoms, and, signs, it, is, most, often, referred, to, as, a, diagnosis, with, the, medical, context, being, implicit, the, information, required, for, a, diagnosis, is, typically, collected, from, a, history, and, physical, examination, of, the, person, seeking, medical, care, often, one, or, more, diagnostic, procedures, such, as, medical, tests, are, also, done, during, the, process, sometimes, the, posthumous, diagnosis, is, considered, a, kind, of, medical, diagnosis, diagnosis, is, often, challenging, because, many, signs, and, symptoms, are, nonspecific, for, example, redness, of, the, skin, erythema, by, itself, is, a, sign, of, many, disorders, and, thus, does, not, tell, the, healthcare, professional, what, is, wrong, thus, differential, diagnosis, in, which, several, possible, explanations, are, compared, and, contrasted, must, be, performed, this, involves, the, correlation, of, various, pieces, of, information, followed, by, the, recognition, and, differentiation, of, patterns, occasionally, the, process, is, made, easy, by, a, sign, or, symptom, or, a, group, of, several, that, is, pathognomonic, diagnosis, is, a, major, component, of, the, procedure, of, a, doctor, s, visit, from, the, point, of, view, of, statistics, the, diagnostic, procedure, involves, classification, tests, a, diagnosis, in, the, sense, of, diagnostic, procedure, can, be, regarded, as, an, attempt, at, classification, of, an, individual, s, condition, into, separate, and, distinct, categories, that, allow, medical, decisions, about, treatment, and, prognosis, to, be, made, subsequently, a, diagnostic, opinion, is, often, described, in, terms, of, a, disease, or, other, condition, in, the, case, of, a, wrong, diagnosis, however, the, individual, s, actual, disease, or, condition, is, not, the, same, as, the, individual, s, diagnosis, a, total, evaluation, of, a, condition, is, often, termed, a, diagnostic, workup, a, diagnostic, procedure, may, be, performed, by, various, healthcare, professionals, such, as, a, physician, chiropractor, physiotherapist, dentist, podiatrist, optometrist, nurse, practitioner, healthcare, scientist, or, physician, assistant, this, article, uses, diagnostician, as, any, of, these, person, categories, a, diagnostic, procedure, as, well, as, the, opinion, reached, thereby, does, not, necessarily, involve, elucidation, of, the, etiology, of, the, diseases, or, conditions, of, interest, that, is, what, caused, the, disease, or, condition, such, elucidation, can, be, useful, to, optimize, treatment, further, specify, the, prognosis, or, prevent, recurrence, of, the, disease, or, condition, in, the, future, the, initial, task, is, to, detect, a, medical, indication, to, perform, a, diagnostic, procedure, indications, include, even, during, an, already, ongoing, diagnostic, procedure, there, can, be, an, indication, to, perform, another, separate, diagnostic, procedure, for, another, potentially, concomitant, disease, or, condition, this, may, occur, as, a, result, of, an, incidental, finding, of, a, sign, unrelated, to, the, parameter, of, interest, such, as, can, occur, in, comprehensive, tests, such, as, radiological, studies, like, magnetic, resonance, imaging, or, blood, test, panels, that, also, include, blood, tests, that, are, not, relevant, for, the, ongoing, diagnosis, general, components, which, are, present, in, a, diagnostic, procedure, in, most, of, the, various, available, methods, include, there, are, a, number, of, methods, or, techniques, that, can, be, used, in, a, diagnostic, procedure, including, performing, a, differential, diagnosis, or, following, medical, algorithms, 198, in, reality, a, diagnostic, procedure, may, involve, components, of, multiple, methods, 204, the, method, of, differential, diagnosis, is, based, on, finding, as, many, candidate, diseases, or, conditions, as, possible, that, can, possibly, cause, the, signs, or, symptoms, followed, by, a, process, of, elimination, or, at, least, of, rendering, the, entries, more, or, less, probable, by, further, medical, tests, and, other, processing, aiming, to, reach, the, point, where, only, one, candidate, disease, or, condition, remains, as, probable, the, result, may, also, remain, a, list, of, possible, conditions, ranked, in, order, of, probability, or, severity, such, a, list, is, often, generated, by, computer, aided, diagnosis, systems, the, resultant, diagnostic, opinion, by, this, method, can, be, regarded, more, or, less, as, a, diagnosis, of, exclusion, even, if, it, does, not, result, in, a, single, probable, disease, or, condition, it, can, at, least, rule, out, any, imminently, life, threatening, conditions, unless, the, provider, is, certain, of, the, condition, present, further, medical, tests, such, as, medical, imaging, are, performed, or, scheduled, in, part, to, confirm, or, disprove, the, diagnosis, but, also, to, document, the, patient, s, status, and, keep, the, patient, s, medical, history, up, to, date, if, unexpected, findings, are, made, during, this, process, the, initial, hypothesis, may, be, ruled, out, and, the, provider, must, then, consider, other, hypotheses, in, a, pattern, recognition, method, the, provider, uses, experience, to, recognize, a, pattern, of, clinical, characteristics, 198, it, is, mainly, based, on, certain, symptoms, or, signs, being, associated, with, certain, diseases, or, conditions, not, necessarily, involving, the, more, cognitive, processing, involved, in, a, differential, diagnosis, this, may, be, the, primary, method, used, in, cases, where, diseases, are, obvious, or, the, provider, s, experience, may, enable, him, or, her, to, recognize, the, condition, quickly, theoretically, a, certain, pattern, of, signs, or, symptoms, can, be, directly, associated, with, a, certain, therapy, even, without, a, definite, decision, regarding, what, is, the, actual, disease, but, such, a, compromise, carries, a, substantial, risk, of, missing, a, diagnosis, which, actually, has, a, different, therapy, so, it, may, be, limited, to, cases, where, no, diagnosis, can, be, made, the, term, diagnostic, criteria, designates, the, specific, combination, of, signs, and, symptoms, and, test, results, that, the, clinician, uses, to, attempt, to, determine, the, correct, diagnosis, some, examples, of, diagnostic, criteria, also, known, as, clinical, case, definitions, are, clinical, decision, support, systems, are, interactive, computer, programs, designed, to, assist, health, professionals, with, decision, making, tasks, the, clinician, interacts, with, the, software, utilizing, both, the, clinician, s, knowledge, and, the, software, to, make, a, better, analysis, of, the, patients, data, than, either, human, or, software, could, make, on, their, own, typically, the, system, makes, suggestions, for, the, clinician, to, look, through, and, the, clinician, picks, useful, information, and, removes, erroneous, suggestions, some, programs, attempt, to, do, this, by, replacing, the, clinician, such, as, reading, the, output, of, a, heart, monitor, such, automated, processes, are, usually, deemed, a, device, by, the, fda, and, require, regulatory, approval, in, contrast, clinical, decision, support, systems, that, support, but, do, not, replace, the, clinician, are, deemed, to, be, augmented, intelligence, if, it, meets, the, fda, criteria, that, 1, it, reveals, the, underlying, data, 2, reveals, the, underlying, logic, and, 3, leaves, the, clinician, in, charge, to, shape, and, make, the, decision, other, methods, that, can, be, used, in, performing, a, diagnostic, procedure, include, diagnosis, problems, are, the, dominant, cause, of, medical, malpractice, payments, accounting, for, 35, of, total, payments, in, a, study, of, 25, years, of, data, and, 350, 000, claims, overdiagnosis, is, the, diagnosis, of, disease, that, will, never, cause, symptoms, or, death, during, a, patient, s, lifetime, it, is, a, problem, because, it, turns, people, into, patients, unnecessarily, and, because, it, can, lead, to, economic, waste, overutilization, and, treatments, that, may, cause, harm, overdiagnosis, occurs, when, a, disease, is, diagnosed, correctly, but, the, diagnosis, is, irrelevant, a, correct, diagnosis, may, be, irrelevant, because, treatment, for, the, disease, is, not, available, not, needed, or, not, wanted, most, people, will, experience, at, least, one, diagnostic, error, in, their, lifetime, according, to, a, 2015, report, by, the, national, academies, of, sciences, engineering, and, medicine, causes, and, factors, of, error, in, diagnosis, are, when, making, a, medical, diagnosis, a, lag, time, is, a, delay, in, time, until, a, step, towards, diagnosis, of, a, disease, or, condition, is, made, types, of, lag, times, are, mainly, long, lag, times, are, often, called, diagnostic, odyssey, the, first, recorded, examples, of, medical, diagnosis, are, found, in, the, writings, of, imhotep, 2630, 2611, bc, in, ancient, egypt, the, edwin, smith, papyrus, a, babylonian, medical, textbook, the, diagnostic, handbook, written, by, esagil, kin, apli, fl, 1069, 1046, bc, introduced, the, use, of, empiricism, logic, and, rationality, in, the, diagnosis, of, an, illness, or, disease, traditional, chinese, medicine, as, described, in, the, yellow, emperor, s, inner, canon, or, huangdi, neijing, specified, four, diagnostic, methods, inspection, auscultation, olfaction, inquiry, and, palpation, hippocrates, was, known, to, make, diagnoses, by, tasting, his, patients, urine, and, smelling, their, sweat, medical, diagnosis, or, the, actual, process, of, making, a, diagnosis, is, a, cognitive, process, a, clinician, uses, several, sources, of, data, and, puts, the, pieces, of, the, puzzle, together, to, make, a, diagnostic, impression, the, initial, diagnostic, impression, can, be, a, broad, term, describing, a, category, of, diseases, instead, of, a, specific, disease, or, condition, after, the, initial, diagnostic, impression, the, clinician, obtains, follow, up, tests, and, procedures, to, get, more, data, to, support, or, reject, the, original, diagnosis, and, will, attempt, to, narrow, it, down, to, a, more, specific, level, diagnostic, procedures, are, the, specific, tools, that, the, clinicians, use, to, narrow, the, diagnostic, possibilities, the, plural, of, diagnosis, is, diagnoses, the, verb, is, to, diagnose, and, a, person, who, diagnoses, is, called, a, diagnostician, the, word, diagnosis, d, a, n, o, s, s, is, derived, through, latin, from, the, greek, word, di, gn, sis, from, diagign, skein, meaning, to, discern, distinguish, diagnosis, can, take, many, forms, it, might, be, a, matter, of, naming, the, disease, lesion, dysfunction, or, disability, it, might, be, a, management, naming, or, prognosis, naming, exercise, it, may, indicate, either, degree, of, abnormality, on, a, continuum, or, kind, of, abnormality, in, a, classification, it, is, influenced, by, non, medical, factors, such, as, power, ethics, and, financial, incentives, for, patient, or, doctor, it, can, be, a, brief, summation, or, an, extensive, formulation, even, taking, the, form, of, a, story, or, metaphor, it, might, be, a, means, of, communication, such, as, a, computer, code, through, which, it, triggers, payment, prescription, notification, information, or, advice, it, might, be, pathogenic, or, salutogenic, it, is, generally, uncertain, and, provisional, once, a, diagnostic, opinion, has, been, reached, the, provider, is, able, to, propose, a, management, plan, which, will, include, treatment, as, well, as, plans, for, follow, up, from, this, point, on, in, addition, to, treating, the, patient, s, condition, the, provider, can, educate, the, patient, about, the, etiology, progression, prognosis, other, outcomes, and, possible, treatments, of, her, or, his, ailments, as, well, as, providing, advice, for, maintaining, health, a, treatment, plan, is, proposed, which, may, include, therapy, and, follow, up, consultations, and, tests, to, monitor, the, condition, and, the, progress, of, the, treatment, if, needed, usually, according, to, the, medical, guidelines, provided, by, the, medical, field, on, the, treatment, of, the, particular, illness, relevant, information, should, be, added, to, the, medical, record, of, the, patient, a, failure, to, respond, to, treatments, that, would, normally, work, may, indicate, a, need, for, review, of, the, diagnosis, nancy, mcwilliams, identifies, five, reasons, that, determine, the, necessity, for, diagnosis, sub, types, of, diagnoses, include, signs, and, symptoms, syndrome, disease, medical,
