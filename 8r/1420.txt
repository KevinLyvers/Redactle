pneumonia, is, an, inflammatory, condition, of, the, lung, primarily, affecting, the, small, air, sacs, known, as, alveoli, symptoms, typically, include, some, combination, of, productive, or, dry, cough, chest, pain, fever, and, difficulty, breathing, the, severity, of, the, condition, is, variable, pneumonia, is, usually, caused, by, infection, with, viruses, or, bacteria, and, less, commonly, by, other, microorganisms, identifying, the, responsible, pathogen, can, be, difficult, diagnosis, is, often, based, on, symptoms, and, physical, examination, chest, x, rays, blood, tests, and, culture, of, the, sputum, may, help, confirm, the, diagnosis, the, disease, may, be, classified, by, where, it, was, acquired, such, as, community, or, hospital, acquired, or, healthcare, associated, pneumonia, risk, factors, for, pneumonia, include, cystic, fibrosis, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, sickle, cell, disease, asthma, diabetes, heart, failure, a, history, of, smoking, a, poor, ability, to, cough, such, as, following, a, stroke, and, a, weak, immune, system, vaccines, to, prevent, certain, types, of, pneumonia, such, as, those, caused, by, streptococcus, pneumoniae, bacteria, linked, to, influenza, or, linked, to, covid, 19, are, available, other, methods, of, prevention, include, hand, washing, to, prevent, infection, and, not, smoking, treatment, depends, on, the, underlying, cause, pneumonia, believed, to, be, due, to, bacteria, is, treated, with, antibiotics, if, the, pneumonia, is, severe, the, affected, person, is, generally, hospitalized, oxygen, therapy, may, be, used, if, oxygen, levels, are, low, each, year, pneumonia, affects, about, 450, million, people, globally, 7, of, the, population, and, results, in, about, 4, million, deaths, with, the, introduction, of, antibiotics, and, vaccines, in, the, 20th, century, survival, has, greatly, improved, nevertheless, pneumonia, remains, a, leading, cause, of, death, in, developing, countries, and, also, among, the, very, old, the, very, young, and, the, chronically, ill, pneumonia, often, shortens, the, period, of, suffering, among, those, already, close, to, death, and, has, thus, been, called, the, old, man, s, friend, people, with, infectious, pneumonia, often, have, a, productive, cough, fever, accompanied, by, shaking, chills, shortness, of, breath, sharp, or, stabbing, chest, pain, during, deep, breaths, and, an, increased, rate, of, breathing, in, elderly, people, confusion, may, be, the, most, prominent, sign, the, typical, signs, and, symptoms, in, children, under, five, are, fever, cough, and, fast, or, difficult, breathing, fever, is, not, very, specific, as, it, occurs, in, many, other, common, illnesses, and, may, be, absent, in, those, with, severe, disease, malnutrition, or, in, the, elderly, in, addition, a, cough, is, frequently, absent, in, children, less, than, 2, months, old, more, severe, signs, and, symptoms, in, children, may, include, blue, tinged, skin, unwillingness, to, drink, convulsions, ongoing, vomiting, extremes, of, temperature, or, a, decreased, level, of, consciousness, bacterial, and, viral, cases, of, pneumonia, usually, result, in, similar, symptoms, some, causes, are, associated, with, classic, but, non, specific, clinical, characteristics, pneumonia, caused, by, legionella, may, occur, with, abdominal, pain, diarrhea, or, confusion, pneumonia, caused, by, streptococcus, pneumoniae, is, associated, with, rusty, colored, sputum, pneumonia, caused, by, klebsiella, may, have, bloody, sputum, often, described, as, currant, jelly, bloody, sputum, known, as, hemoptysis, may, also, occur, with, tuberculosis, gram, negative, pneumonia, lung, abscesses, and, more, commonly, acute, bronchitis, pneumonia, caused, by, mycoplasma, pneumoniae, may, occur, in, association, with, swelling, of, the, lymph, nodes, in, the, neck, joint, pain, or, a, middle, ear, infection, viral, pneumonia, presents, more, commonly, with, wheezing, than, bacterial, pneumonia, pneumonia, was, historically, divided, into, typical, and, atypical, based, on, the, belief, that, the, presentation, predicted, the, underlying, cause, however, evidence, has, not, supported, this, distinction, therefore, it, is, no, longer, emphasized, pneumonia, is, due, to, infections, caused, primarily, by, bacteria, or, viruses, and, less, commonly, by, fungi, and, parasites, although, more, than, 100, strains, of, infectious, agents, have, been, identified, only, a, few, are, responsible, for, the, majority, of, cases, mixed, infections, with, both, viruses, and, bacteria, may, occur, in, roughly, 45, of, infections, in, children, and, 15, of, infections, in, adults, a, causative, agent, may, not, be, isolated, in, about, half, of, cases, despite, careful, testing, in, an, active, population, based, surveillance, for, community, acquired, pneumonia, requiring, hospitalization, in, five, hospitals, in, chicago, and, nashville, from, january, 2010, through, june, 2012, 2259, patients, were, identified, who, had, radiographic, evidence, of, pneumonia, and, specimens, that, could, be, tested, for, the, responsible, pathogen, most, patients, 62, had, no, detectable, pathogens, in, their, sample, and, unexpectedly, respiratory, viruses, were, detected, more, frequently, than, bacteria, specifically, 23, had, one, or, more, viruses, 11, had, one, or, more, bacteria, 3, had, both, bacterial, and, viral, pathogens, and, 1, had, a, fungal, or, mycobacterial, infection, the, most, common, pathogens, were, human, rhinovirus, in, 9, of, patients, influenza, virus, in, 6, and, streptococcus, pneumoniae, in, 5, the, term, pneumonia, is, sometimes, more, broadly, applied, to, any, condition, resulting, in, inflammation, of, the, lungs, caused, for, example, by, autoimmune, diseases, chemical, burns, or, drug, reactions, however, this, inflammation, is, more, accurately, referred, to, as, pneumonitis, factors, that, predispose, to, pneumonia, include, smoking, immunodeficiency, alcoholism, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, sickle, cell, disease, scd, asthma, chronic, kidney, disease, liver, disease, and, biological, aging, additional, risks, in, children, include, not, being, breastfed, exposure, to, cigarette, smoke, and, other, air, pollution, malnutrition, and, poverty, the, use, of, acid, suppressing, medications, such, as, proton, pump, inhibitors, or, h2, blockers, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, pneumonia, approximately, 10, of, people, who, require, mechanical, ventilation, develop, ventilator, associated, pneumonia, and, people, with, a, gastric, feeding, tube, have, an, increased, risk, of, developing, aspiration, pneumonia, moreover, the, misplacement, of, a, feeding, tube, can, lead, to, aspiration, pneumonia, 28, of, tube, malposition, results, in, pneumonia, as, with, avanos, medical, s, feeding, tube, placement, system, the, cortrak, 2, eas, which, was, recalled, in, may, 2022, by, the, fda, due, to, adverse, events, reported, including, pneumonia, caused, a, total, of, 60, injuries, and, 23, patient, deaths, as, communicated, by, the, fda, for, people, with, certain, variants, of, the, fer, gene, the, risk, of, death, is, reduced, in, sepsis, caused, by, pneumonia, however, for, those, with, tlr6, variants, the, risk, of, getting, legionnaires, disease, is, increased, bacteria, are, the, most, common, cause, of, community, acquired, pneumonia, cap, with, streptococcus, pneumoniae, isolated, in, nearly, 50, of, cases, other, commonly, isolated, bacteria, include, haemophilus, influenzae, in, 20, chlamydophila, pneumoniae, in, 13, and, mycoplasma, pneumoniae, in, 3, of, cases, staphylococcus, aureus, moraxella, catarrhalis, and, legionella, pneumophila, a, number, of, drug, resistant, versions, of, the, above, infections, are, becoming, more, common, including, drug, resistant, streptococcus, pneumoniae, drsp, and, methicillin, resistant, staphylococcus, aureus, mrsa, the, spreading, of, organisms, is, facilitated, by, certain, risk, factors, alcoholism, is, associated, with, streptococcus, pneumoniae, anaerobic, organisms, and, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, smoking, facilitates, the, effects, of, streptococcus, pneumoniae, haemophilus, influenzae, moraxella, catarrhalis, and, legionella, pneumophila, exposure, to, birds, is, associated, with, chlamydia, psittaci, farm, animals, with, coxiella, burnetti, aspiration, of, stomach, contents, with, anaerobic, organisms, and, cystic, fibrosis, with, pseudomonas, aeruginosa, and, staphylococcus, aureus, streptococcus, pneumoniae, is, more, common, in, the, winter, and, it, should, be, suspected, in, persons, aspirating, a, large, number, of, anaerobic, organisms, in, adults, viruses, account, for, about, one, third, of, pneumonia, cases, and, in, children, for, about, 15, of, them, commonly, implicated, agents, include, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza, virus, respiratory, syncytial, virus, rsv, adenovirus, and, parainfluenza, herpes, simplex, virus, rarely, causes, pneumonia, except, in, groups, such, as, newborns, persons, with, cancer, transplant, recipients, and, people, with, significant, burns, after, organ, transplantation, or, in, otherwise, immunocompromised, persons, there, are, high, rates, of, cytomegalovirus, pneumonia, those, with, viral, infections, may, be, secondarily, infected, with, the, bacteria, streptococcus, pneumoniae, staphylococcus, aureus, or, haemophilus, influenzae, particularly, when, other, health, problems, are, present, different, viruses, predominate, at, different, times, of, the, year, during, flu, season, for, example, influenza, may, account, for, more, than, half, of, all, viral, cases, outbreaks, of, other, viruses, also, occur, occasionally, including, hantaviruses, and, coronaviruses, severe, acute, respiratory, syndrome, coronavirus, 2, sars, cov, 2, can, also, result, in, pneumonia, fungal, pneumonia, is, uncommon, but, occurs, more, commonly, in, individuals, with, weakened, immune, systems, due, to, aids, immunosuppressive, drugs, or, other, medical, problems, it, is, most, often, caused, by, histoplasma, capsulatum, blastomyces, cryptococcus, neoformans, pneumocystis, jiroveci, pneumocystis, pneumonia, or, pcp, and, coccidioides, immitis, histoplasmosis, is, most, common, in, the, mississippi, river, basin, and, coccidioidomycosis, is, most, common, in, the, southwestern, united, states, the, number, of, cases, of, fungal, pneumonia, has, been, increasing, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, due, to, increasing, travel, and, rates, of, immunosuppression, in, the, population, for, people, infected, with, hiv, aids, pcp, is, a, common, opportunistic, infection, a, variety, of, parasites, can, affect, the, lungs, including, toxoplasma, gondii, strongyloides, stercoralis, ascaris, lumbricoides, and, plasmodium, malariae, these, organisms, typically, enter, the, body, through, direct, contact, with, the, skin, ingestion, or, via, an, insect, vector, except, for, paragonimus, westermani, most, parasites, do, not, specifically, affect, the, lungs, but, involve, the, lungs, secondarily, to, other, sites, some, parasites, in, particular, those, belonging, to, the, ascaris, and, strongyloides, genera, stimulate, a, strong, eosinophilic, reaction, which, may, result, in, eosinophilic, pneumonia, in, other, infections, such, as, malaria, lung, involvement, is, due, primarily, to, cytokine, induced, systemic, inflammation, in, the, developed, world, these, infections, are, most, common, in, people, returning, from, travel, or, in, immigrants, around, the, world, parasitic, pneumonia, is, most, common, in, the, immunodeficient, idiopathic, interstitial, pneumonia, or, noninfectious, pneumonia, is, a, class, of, diffuse, lung, diseases, they, include, diffuse, alveolar, damage, organizing, pneumonia, nonspecific, interstitial, pneumonia, lymphocytic, interstitial, pneumonia, desquamative, interstitial, pneumonia, respiratory, bronchiolitis, interstitial, lung, disease, and, usual, interstitial, pneumonia, lipoid, pneumonia, is, another, rare, cause, due, to, lipids, entering, the, lung, these, lipids, can, either, be, inhaled, or, spread, to, the, lungs, from, elsewhere, in, the, body, pneumonia, frequently, starts, as, an, upper, respiratory, tract, infection, that, moves, into, the, lower, respiratory, tract, it, is, a, type, of, pneumonitis, lung, inflammation, the, normal, flora, of, the, upper, airway, give, protection, by, competing, with, pathogens, for, nutrients, in, the, lower, airways, reflexes, of, the, glottis, actions, of, complement, proteins, and, immunoglobulins, are, important, for, protection, micro, aspiration, of, contaminated, secretions, can, infect, the, lower, airways, and, cause, pneumonia, the, progress, of, pneumonia, is, determined, by, the, virulence, of, the, organism, the, amount, of, organism, required, to, start, an, infection, and, the, body, s, immune, response, against, the, infection, most, bacteria, enter, the, lungs, via, small, aspirations, of, organisms, residing, in, the, throat, or, nose, half, of, normal, people, have, these, small, aspirations, during, sleep, while, the, throat, always, contains, bacteria, potentially, infectious, ones, reside, there, only, at, certain, times, and, under, certain, conditions, a, minority, of, types, of, bacteria, such, as, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, and, legionella, pneumophila, reach, the, lungs, via, contaminated, airborne, droplets, bacteria, can, also, spread, via, the, blood, once, in, the, lungs, bacteria, may, invade, the, spaces, between, cells, and, between, alveoli, where, the, macrophages, and, neutrophils, defensive, white, blood, cells, attempt, to, inactivate, the, bacteria, the, neutrophils, also, release, cytokines, causing, a, general, activation, of, the, immune, system, this, leads, to, the, fever, chills, and, fatigue, common, in, bacterial, pneumonia, the, neutrophils, bacteria, and, fluid, from, surrounding, blood, vessels, fill, the, alveoli, resulting, in, the, consolidation, seen, on, chest, x, ray, viruses, may, reach, the, lung, by, a, number, of, different, routes, respiratory, syncytial, virus, is, typically, contracted, when, people, touch, contaminated, objects, and, then, touch, their, eyes, or, nose, other, viral, infections, occur, when, contaminated, airborne, droplets, are, inhaled, through, the, nose, or, mouth, once, in, the, upper, airway, the, viruses, may, make, their, way, into, the, lungs, where, they, invade, the, cells, lining, the, airways, alveoli, or, lung, parenchyma, some, viruses, such, as, measles, and, herpes, simplex, may, reach, the, lungs, via, the, blood, the, invasion, of, the, lungs, may, lead, to, varying, degrees, of, cell, death, when, the, immune, system, responds, to, the, infection, even, more, lung, damage, may, occur, primarily, white, blood, cells, mainly, mononuclear, cells, generate, the, inflammation, as, well, as, damaging, the, lungs, many, viruses, simultaneously, affect, other, organs, and, thus, disrupt, other, body, functions, viruses, also, make, the, body, more, susceptible, to, bacterial, infections, in, this, way, bacterial, pneumonia, can, occur, at, the, same, time, as, viral, pneumonia, pneumonia, is, typically, diagnosed, based, on, a, combination, of, physical, signs, and, often, a, chest, x, ray, in, adults, with, normal, vital, signs, and, a, normal, lung, examination, the, diagnosis, is, unlikely, however, the, underlying, cause, can, be, difficult, to, confirm, as, there, is, no, definitive, test, able, to, distinguish, between, bacterial, and, non, bacterial, cause, the, overall, impression, of, a, physician, appears, to, be, at, least, as, good, as, decision, rules, for, making, or, excluding, the, diagnosis, the, world, health, organization, has, defined, pneumonia, in, children, clinically, based, on, either, a, cough, or, difficulty, breathing, and, a, rapid, respiratory, rate, chest, indrawing, or, a, decreased, level, of, consciousness, a, rapid, respiratory, rate, is, defined, as, greater, than, 60, breaths, per, minute, in, children, under, 2, months, old, greater, than, 50, breaths, per, minute, in, children, 2, months, to, 1, year, old, or, greater, than, 40, breaths, per, minute, in, children, 1, to, 5, years, old, in, children, low, oxygen, levels, and, lower, chest, indrawing, are, more, sensitive, than, hearing, chest, crackles, with, a, stethoscope, or, increased, respiratory, rate, grunting, and, nasal, flaring, may, be, other, useful, signs, in, children, less, than, five, years, old, lack, of, wheezing, is, an, indicator, of, mycoplasma, pneumoniae, in, children, with, pneumonia, but, as, an, indicator, it, is, not, accurate, enough, to, decide, whether, or, not, macrolide, treatment, should, be, used, the, presence, of, chest, pain, in, children, with, pneumonia, doubles, the, probability, of, mycoplasma, pneumoniae, in, general, in, adults, investigations, are, not, needed, in, mild, cases, there, is, a, very, low, risk, of, pneumonia, if, all, vital, signs, and, auscultation, are, normal, c, reactive, protein, crp, may, help, support, the, diagnosis, for, those, with, crp, less, than, 20, mg, l, without, convincing, evidence, of, pneumonia, antibiotics, are, not, recommended, procalcitonin, may, help, determine, the, cause, and, support, decisions, about, who, should, receive, antibiotics, antibiotics, are, encouraged, if, the, procalcitonin, level, reaches, 0, 25, g, l, strongly, encouraged, if, it, reaches, 0, 5, g, l, and, strongly, discouraged, if, the, level, is, below, 0, 10, g, l, in, people, requiring, hospitalization, pulse, oximetry, chest, radiography, and, blood, tests, including, a, complete, blood, count, serum, electrolytes, c, reactive, protein, level, and, possibly, liver, function, tests, are, recommended, the, diagnosis, of, influenza, like, illness, can, be, made, based, on, the, signs, and, symptoms, however, confirmation, of, an, influenza, infection, requires, testing, thus, treatment, is, frequently, based, on, the, presence, of, influenza, in, the, community, or, a, rapid, influenza, test, adults, 65, years, old, or, older, as, well, as, cigarette, smokers, and, people, with, ongoing, medical, conditions, are, at, increased, risk, for, pneumonia, physical, examination, may, sometimes, reveal, low, blood, pressure, high, heart, rate, or, low, oxygen, saturation, the, respiratory, rate, may, be, faster, than, normal, and, this, may, occur, a, day, or, two, before, other, signs, examination, of, the, chest, may, be, normal, but, it, may, show, decreased, expansion, on, the, affected, side, harsh, breath, sounds, from, the, larger, airways, that, are, transmitted, through, the, inflamed, lung, are, termed, bronchial, breathing, and, are, heard, on, auscultation, with, a, stethoscope, crackles, rales, may, be, heard, over, the, affected, area, during, inspiration, percussion, may, be, dulled, over, the, affected, lung, and, increased, rather, than, decreased, vocal, resonance, distinguishes, pneumonia, from, a, pleural, effusion, a, chest, radiograph, is, frequently, used, in, diagnosis, in, people, with, mild, disease, imaging, is, needed, only, in, those, with, potential, complications, those, not, having, improved, with, treatment, or, those, in, which, the, cause, is, uncertain, if, a, person, is, sufficiently, sick, to, require, hospitalization, a, chest, radiograph, is, recommended, findings, do, not, always, match, the, severity, of, disease, and, do, not, reliably, separate, between, bacterial, and, viral, infection, x, ray, presentations, of, pneumonia, may, be, classified, as, lobar, pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, lobular, pneumonia, and, interstitial, pneumonia, bacterial, community, acquired, pneumonia, classically, show, lung, consolidation, of, one, lung, segmental, lobe, which, is, known, as, lobar, pneumonia, however, findings, may, vary, and, other, patterns, are, common, in, other, types, of, pneumonia, aspiration, pneumonia, may, present, with, bilateral, opacities, primarily, in, the, bases, of, the, lungs, and, on, the, right, side, radiographs, of, viral, pneumonia, may, appear, normal, appear, hyper, inflated, have, bilateral, patchy, areas, or, present, similar, to, bacterial, pneumonia, with, lobar, consolidation, radiologic, findings, may, not, be, present, in, the, early, stages, of, the, disease, especially, in, the, presence, of, dehydration, or, may, be, difficult, to, interpret, in, the, obese, or, those, with, a, history, of, lung, disease, complications, such, as, pleural, effusion, may, also, be, found, on, chest, radiographs, laterolateral, chest, radiographs, can, increase, the, diagnostic, accuracy, of, lung, consolidation, and, pleural, effusion, a, ct, scan, can, give, additional, information, in, indeterminate, cases, and, provide, more, details, in, those, with, an, unclear, chest, radiograph, for, example, occult, pneumonia, in, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, they, can, be, used, to, exclude, pulmonary, embolism, and, fungal, pneumonia, and, detect, lung, abscesses, in, those, who, are, not, responding, to, treatments, however, ct, scans, are, more, expensive, have, a, higher, dose, of, radiation, and, cannot, be, done, at, bedside, lung, ultrasound, may, also, be, useful, in, helping, to, make, the, diagnosis, ultrasound, is, radiation, free, and, can, be, done, at, bedside, however, ultrasound, requires, specific, skills, to, operate, the, machine, and, interpret, the, findings, it, may, be, more, accurate, than, chest, x, ray, in, people, managed, in, the, community, determining, the, causative, agent, is, not, cost, effective, and, typically, does, not, alter, management, for, people, who, do, not, respond, to, treatment, sputum, culture, should, be, considered, and, culture, for, mycobacterium, tuberculosis, should, be, carried, out, in, persons, with, a, chronic, productive, cough, microbiological, evaluation, is, also, indicated, in, severe, pneumonia, alcoholism, asplenia, immunosuppression, hiv, infection, and, those, being, empirically, treated, for, mrsa, of, pseudomonas, although, positive, blood, culture, and, pleural, fluid, culture, definitively, establish, the, diagnosis, of, the, type, of, micro, organism, involved, a, positive, sputum, culture, has, to, be, interpreted, with, care, for, the, possibility, of, colonisation, of, respiratory, tract, testing, for, other, specific, organisms, may, be, recommended, during, outbreaks, for, public, health, reasons, in, those, hospitalized, for, severe, disease, both, sputum, and, blood, cultures, are, recommended, as, well, as, testing, the, urine, for, antigens, to, legionella, and, streptococcus, viral, infections, can, be, confirmed, via, detection, of, either, the, virus, or, its, antigens, with, culture, or, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, among, other, techniques, mycoplasma, legionella, streptococcus, and, chlamydia, can, also, be, detected, using, pcr, techniques, on, bronchoalveolar, lavage, and, nasopharyngeal, swab, the, causative, agent, is, determined, in, only, 15, of, cases, with, routine, microbiological, tests, pneumonitis, refers, to, lung, inflammation, pneumonia, refers, to, pneumonitis, usually, due, to, infection, but, sometimes, non, infectious, that, has, the, additional, feature, of, pulmonary, consolidation, pneumonia, is, most, commonly, classified, by, where, or, how, it, was, acquired, community, acquired, aspiration, healthcare, associated, hospital, acquired, and, ventilator, associated, pneumonia, it, may, also, be, classified, by, the, area, of, the, lung, affected, lobar, bronchial, pneumonia, and, acute, interstitial, pneumonia, or, by, the, causative, organism, pneumonia, in, children, may, additionally, be, classified, based, on, signs, and, symptoms, as, non, severe, severe, or, very, severe, the, setting, in, which, pneumonia, develops, is, important, to, treatment, as, it, correlates, to, which, pathogens, are, likely, suspects, which, mechanisms, are, likely, which, antibiotics, are, likely, to, work, or, fail, and, which, complications, can, be, expected, based, on, the, person, s, health, status, community, acquired, pneumonia, cap, is, acquired, in, the, community, outside, of, health, care, facilities, compared, with, healthcare, associated, pneumonia, it, is, less, likely, to, involve, multidrug, resistant, bacteria, although, the, latter, are, no, longer, rare, in, cap, they, are, still, less, likely, prior, stays, in, healthcare, related, environments, such, as, hospitals, nursing, homes, or, hemodialysis, centers, or, a, history, of, receiving, domiciliary, care, can, increase, patients, risk, for, cap, caused, by, multidrug, resistant, bacteria, health, care, associated, pneumonia, hcap, is, an, infection, associated, with, recent, exposure, to, the, health, care, system, including, hospitals, outpatient, clinics, nursing, homes, dialysis, centers, chemotherapy, treatment, or, home, care, hcap, is, sometimes, called, mcap, medical, care, associated, pneumonia, people, may, become, infected, with, pneumonia, in, a, hospital, this, is, defined, as, pneumonia, not, present, at, the, time, of, admission, symptoms, must, start, at, least, 48, hours, after, admission, it, is, likely, to, involve, hospital, acquired, infections, with, higher, risk, of, multidrug, resistant, pathogens, people, in, a, hospital, often, have, other, medical, conditions, which, may, make, them, more, susceptible, to, pathogens, in, the, hospital, ventilator, associated, pneumonia, occurs, in, people, breathing, with, the, help, of, mechanical, ventilation, ventilator, associated, pneumonia, is, specifically, defined, as, pneumonia, that, arises, more, than, 48, to, 72, hours, after, endotracheal, intubation, several, diseases, can, present, with, similar, signs, and, symptoms, to, pneumonia, such, as, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, asthma, pulmonary, edema, bronchiectasis, lung, cancer, and, pulmonary, emboli, unlike, pneumonia, asthma, and, copd, typically, present, with, wheezing, pulmonary, edema, presents, with, an, abnormal, electrocardiogram, cancer, and, bronchiectasis, present, with, a, cough, of, longer, duration, and, pulmonary, emboli, present, with, acute, onset, sharp, chest, pain, and, shortness, of, breath, mild, pneumonia, should, be, differentiated, from, upper, respiratory, tract, infection, urti, severe, pneumonia, should, be, differentiated, from, acute, heart, failure, pulmonary, infiltrates, that, resolved, after, giving, mechanical, ventilation, should, point, to, heart, failure, and, atelectasis, rather, than, pneumonia, for, recurrent, pneumonia, underlying, lung, cancer, metastasis, tuberculosis, a, foreign, bodies, immunosuppression, and, hypersensitivity, should, be, suspected, prevention, includes, vaccination, environmental, measures, and, appropriate, treatment, of, other, health, problems, it, is, believed, that, if, appropriate, preventive, measures, were, instituted, globally, mortality, among, children, could, be, reduced, by, 400, 000, and, if, proper, treatment, were, universally, available, childhood, deaths, could, be, decreased, by, another, 600, 000, vaccination, prevents, against, certain, bacterial, and, viral, pneumonias, both, in, children, and, adults, influenza, vaccines, are, modestly, effective, at, preventing, symptoms, of, influenza, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, recommends, yearly, influenza, vaccination, for, every, person, 6, months, and, older, immunizing, health, care, workers, decreases, the, risk, of, viral, pneumonia, among, their, patients, vaccinations, against, haemophilus, influenzae, and, streptococcus, pneumoniae, have, good, evidence, to, support, their, use, there, is, strong, evidence, for, vaccinating, children, under, the, age, of, 2, against, streptococcus, pneumoniae, pneumococcal, conjugate, vaccine, vaccinating, children, against, streptococcus, pneumoniae, has, led, to, a, decreased, rate, of, these, infections, in, adults, because, many, adults, acquire, infections, from, children, a, streptococcus, pneumoniae, vaccine, is, available, for, adults, and, has, been, found, to, decrease, the, risk, of, invasive, pneumococcal, disease, by, 74, but, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, suggest, using, the, pneumococcal, vaccine, to, prevent, pneumonia, or, death, in, the, general, adult, population, the, cdc, recommends, that, young, children, and, adults, over, the, age, of, 65, receive, the, pneumococcal, vaccine, as, well, as, older, children, or, younger, adults, who, have, an, increased, risk, of, getting, pneumococcal, disease, the, pneumococcal, vaccine, has, been, shown, to, reduce, the, risk, of, community, acquired, pneumonia, in, people, with, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, but, does, not, reduce, mortality, or, the, risk, of, hospitalization, for, people, with, this, condition, people, with, copd, are, recommended, by, a, number, of, guidelines, to, have, a, pneumococcal, vaccination, other, vaccines, for, which, there, is, support, for, a, protective, effect, against, pneumonia, include, pertussis, varicella, and, measles, when, influenza, outbreaks, occur, medications, such, as, amantadine, or, rimantadine, may, help, prevent, the, condition, but, they, are, associated, with, side, effects, zanamivir, or, oseltamivir, decrease, the, chance, that, people, who, are, exposed, to, the, virus, will, develop, symptoms, however, it, is, recommended, that, potential, side, effects, are, taken, into, account, smoking, cessation, and, reducing, indoor, air, pollution, such, as, that, from, cooking, indoors, with, wood, crop, residues, or, dung, are, both, recommended, smoking, appears, to, be, the, single, biggest, risk, factor, for, pneumococcal, pneumonia, in, otherwise, healthy, adults, hand, hygiene, and, coughing, into, one, s, sleeve, may, also, be, effective, preventative, measures, wearing, surgical, masks, by, the, sick, may, also, prevent, illness, appropriately, treating, underlying, illnesses, such, as, hiv, aids, diabetes, mellitus, and, malnutrition, can, decrease, the, risk, of, pneumonia, in, children, less, than, 6, months, of, age, exclusive, breast, feeding, reduces, both, the, risk, and, severity, of, disease, in, people, with, hiv, aids, and, a, cd4, count, of, less, than, 200, cells, ul, the, antibiotic, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, decreases, the, risk, of, pneumocystis, pneumonia, and, is, also, useful, for, prevention, in, those, that, are, immunocompromised, but, do, not, have, hiv, testing, pregnant, women, for, group, b, streptococcus, and, chlamydia, trachomatis, and, administering, antibiotic, treatment, if, needed, reduces, rates, of, pneumonia, in, infants, preventive, measures, for, hiv, transmission, from, mother, to, child, may, also, be, efficient, suctioning, the, mouth, and, throat, of, infants, with, meconium, stained, amniotic, fluid, has, not, been, found, to, reduce, the, rate, of, aspiration, pneumonia, and, may, cause, potential, harm, thus, this, practice, is, not, recommended, in, the, majority, of, situations, in, the, frail, elderly, good, oral, health, care, may, lower, the, risk, of, aspiration, pneumonia, even, though, there, is, no, good, evidence, that, one, approach, to, mouth, care, is, better, than, others, in, preventing, nursing, home, acquired, pneumonia, zinc, supplementation, in, children, 2, months, to, five, years, old, appears, to, reduce, rates, of, pneumonia, for, people, with, low, levels, of, vitamin, c, in, their, diet, or, blood, taking, vitamin, c, supplements, may, be, suggested, to, decrease, the, risk, of, pneumonia, although, there, is, no, strong, evidence, of, benefit, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, recommend, that, the, general, population, take, vitamin, c, to, prevent, or, treat, pneumonia, for, adults, and, children, in, the, hospital, who, require, a, respirator, there, is, no, strong, evidence, indicating, a, difference, between, heat, and, moisture, exchangers, and, heated, humidifiers, for, preventing, pneumonia, there, is, tentative, evidence, that, laying, flat, on, the, back, compared, to, semi, raised, increases, pneumonia, risks, in, people, who, are, intubated, antibiotics, by, mouth, rest, simple, analgesics, and, fluids, usually, suffice, for, complete, resolution, however, those, with, other, medical, conditions, the, elderly, or, those, with, significant, trouble, breathing, may, require, more, advanced, care, if, the, symptoms, worsen, the, pneumonia, does, not, improve, with, home, treatment, or, complications, occur, hospitalization, may, be, required, worldwide, approximately, 7, 13, of, cases, in, children, result, in, hospitalization, whereas, in, the, developed, world, between, 22, and, 42, of, adults, with, community, acquired, pneumonia, are, admitted, the, curb, 65, score, is, useful, for, determining, the, need, for, admission, in, adults, if, the, score, is, 0, or, 1, people, can, typically, be, managed, at, home, if, it, is, 2, a, short, hospital, stay, or, close, follow, up, is, needed, if, it, is, 3, 5, hospitalization, is, recommended, in, children, those, with, respiratory, distress, or, oxygen, saturations, of, less, than, 90, should, be, hospitalized, the, utility, of, chest, physiotherapy, in, pneumonia, has, not, yet, been, determined, over, the, counter, cough, medicine, has, not, been, found, to, be, effective, nor, has, the, use, of, zinc, supplementation, in, children, there, is, insufficient, evidence, for, mucolytics, there, is, no, strong, evidence, to, recommend, that, children, who, have, non, measles, related, pneumonia, take, vitamin, a, supplements, vitamin, d, as, of, 2023, is, of, unclear, benefit, in, children, vitamin, c, administration, in, pneumonia, needs, further, research, although, it, can, be, given, to, patient, of, low, plasma, vitamin, c, because, it, is, not, expensive, and, low, risk, pneumonia, can, cause, severe, illness, in, a, number, of, ways, and, pneumonia, with, evidence, of, organ, dysfunction, may, require, intensive, care, unit, admission, for, observation, and, specific, treatment, the, main, impact, is, on, the, respiratory, and, the, circulatory, system, respiratory, failure, not, responding, to, normal, oxygen, therapy, may, require, heated, humidified, high, flow, therapy, delivered, through, nasal, cannulae, non, invasive, ventilation, or, in, severe, cases, mechanical, ventilation, through, an, endotracheal, tube, regarding, circulatory, problems, as, part, of, sepsis, evidence, of, poor, blood, flow, or, low, blood, pressure, is, initially, treated, with, 30, ml, kg, of, crystalloid, infused, intravenously, in, situations, where, fluids, alone, are, ineffective, vasopressor, medication, may, be, required, for, adults, with, moderate, or, severe, acute, respiratory, distress, syndrome, ards, undergoing, mechanical, ventilation, there, is, a, reduction, in, mortality, when, people, lie, on, their, front, for, at, least, 12, hours, a, day, however, this, increases, the, risk, of, endotracheal, tube, obstruction, and, pressure, sores, antibiotics, improve, outcomes, in, those, with, bacterial, pneumonia, the, first, dose, of, antibiotics, should, be, given, as, soon, as, possible, increased, use, of, antibiotics, however, may, lead, to, the, development, of, antimicrobial, resistant, strains, of, bacteria, antibiotic, choice, depends, initially, on, the, characteristics, of, the, person, affected, such, as, age, underlying, health, and, the, location, the, infection, was, acquired, antibiotic, use, is, also, associated, with, side, effects, such, as, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, taste, distortion, or, headaches, in, the, uk, treatment, before, culture, results, with, amoxicillin, is, recommended, as, the, first, line, for, community, acquired, pneumonia, with, doxycycline, or, clarithromycin, as, alternatives, in, north, america, amoxicillin, doxycycline, and, in, some, areas, a, macrolide, such, as, azithromycin, or, erythromycin, is, the, first, line, outpatient, treatment, in, adults, in, children, with, mild, or, moderate, symptoms, amoxicillin, taken, by, mouth, is, the, first, line, the, use, of, fluoroquinolones, in, uncomplicated, cases, is, discouraged, due, to, concerns, about, side, effects, and, generating, resistance, in, light, of, there, being, no, greater, benefit, for, those, who, require, hospitalization, and, caught, their, pneumonia, in, the, community, the, use, of, a, lactam, such, as, cephazolin, plus, a, macrolide, such, as, azithromycin, is, recommended, a, fluoroquinolone, may, replace, azithromycin, but, is, less, preferred, antibiotics, by, mouth, and, by, injection, appear, to, be, similarly, effective, in, children, with, severe, pneumonia, the, duration, of, treatment, has, traditionally, been, seven, to, ten, days, but, increasing, evidence, suggests, that, shorter, courses, 3, 5, days, may, be, effective, for, certain, types, of, pneumonia, and, may, reduce, the, risk, of, antibiotic, resistance, research, in, children, showed, that, a, shorter, 3, day, course, of, amoxicillin, was, as, effective, as, a, longer, 7, day, course, for, treating, pneumonia, in, this, population, for, pneumonia, that, is, associated, with, a, ventilator, caused, by, non, fermenting, gram, negative, bacilli, nf, gnb, a, shorter, course, of, antibiotics, increases, the, risk, that, the, pneumonia, will, return, recommendations, for, hospital, acquired, pneumonia, include, third, and, fourth, generation, cephalosporins, carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and, vancomycin, these, antibiotics, are, often, given, intravenously, and, used, in, combination, in, those, treated, in, hospital, more, than, 90, improve, with, the, initial, antibiotics, for, people, with, ventilator, acquired, pneumonia, the, choice, of, antibiotic, therapy, will, depend, on, the, person, s, risk, of, being, infected, with, a, strain, of, bacteria, that, is, multi, drug, resistant, once, clinically, stable, intravenous, antibiotics, should, be, switched, to, oral, antibiotics, for, those, with, methicillin, resistant, staphylococcus, aureus, mrsa, or, legionella, infections, prolonged, antibiotics, may, be, beneficial, the, addition, of, corticosteroids, to, standard, antibiotic, treatment, appears, to, improve, outcomes, reducing, death, and, morbidity, for, adults, with, severe, community, acquired, pneumonia, and, reducing, death, for, adults, and, children, with, non, severe, community, acquired, pneumonia, a, 2017, review, therefore, recommended, them, in, adults, with, severe, community, acquired, pneumonia, a, 2019, guideline, however, recommended, against, their, general, use, unless, refractory, shock, was, present, side, effects, associated, with, the, use, of, corticosteroids, include, high, blood, sugar, there, is, some, evidence, that, adding, corticosteroids, to, the, standard, pcp, pneumonia, treatment, may, be, beneficial, for, people, who, are, infected, with, hiv, the, use, of, granulocyte, colony, stimulating, factor, g, csf, along, with, antibiotics, does, not, appear, to, reduce, mortality, and, routine, use, for, treating, pneumonia, is, not, supported, by, evidence, neuraminidase, inhibitors, may, be, used, to, treat, viral, pneumonia, caused, by, influenza, viruses, influenza, a, and, influenza, b, no, specific, antiviral, medications, are, recommended, for, other, types, of, community, acquired, viral, pneumonias, including, sars, coronavirus, adenovirus, hantavirus, and, parainfluenza, virus, influenza, a, may, be, treated, with, rimantadine, or, amantadine, while, influenza, a, or, b, may, be, treated, with, oseltamivir, zanamivir, or, peramivir, these, are, of, most, benefit, if, they, are, started, within, 48, hours, of, the, onset, of, symptoms, many, strains, of, h5n1, influenza, a, also, known, as, avian, influenza, or, bird, flu, have, shown, resistance, to, rimantadine, and, amantadine, the, use, of, antibiotics, in, viral, pneumonia, is, recommended, by, some, experts, as, it, is, impossible, to, rule, out, a, complicating, bacterial, infection, the, british, thoracic, society, recommends, that, antibiotics, be, withheld, in, those, with, mild, disease, the, use, of, corticosteroids, is, controversial, in, general, aspiration, pneumonitis, is, treated, conservatively, with, antibiotics, indicated, only, for, aspiration, pneumonia, the, choice, of, antibiotic, will, depend, on, several, factors, including, the, suspected, causative, organism, and, whether, pneumonia, was, acquired, in, the, community, or, developed, in, a, hospital, setting, common, options, include, clindamycin, a, combination, of, a, beta, lactam, antibiotic, and, metronidazole, or, an, aminoglycoside, corticosteroids, are, sometimes, used, in, aspiration, pneumonia, but, there, is, limited, evidence, to, support, their, effectiveness, the, british, thoracic, society, recommends, that, a, follow, up, chest, radiograph, be, taken, in, people, with, persistent, symptoms, smokers, and, people, older, than, 50, american, guidelines, vary, from, generally, recommending, a, follow, up, chest, radiograph, to, not, mentioning, any, follow, up, with, treatment, most, types, of, bacterial, pneumonia, will, stabilize, in, 3, 6, days, it, often, takes, a, few, weeks, before, most, symptoms, resolve, x, ray, findings, typically, clear, within, four, weeks, and, mortality, is, low, less, than, 1, in, the, elderly, or, people, with, other, lung, problems, recovery, may, take, more, than, 12, weeks, in, persons, requiring, hospitalization, mortality, may, be, as, high, as, 10, and, in, those, requiring, intensive, care, it, may, reach, 30, 50, pneumonia, is, the, most, common, hospital, acquired, infection, that, causes, death, before, the, advent, of, antibiotics, mortality, was, typically, 30, in, those, that, were, hospitalized, however, for, those, whose, lung, condition, deteriorates, within, 72, hours, the, problem, is, usually, due, to, sepsis, if, pneumonia, deteriorates, after, 72, hours, it, could, be, due, to, nosocomial, infection, or, excerbation, of, other, underlying, comorbidities, about, 10, of, those, discharged, from, hospital, are, readmitted, due, to, underlying, co, morbidities, such, as, heart, lung, or, neurological, disorders, or, due, to, new, onset, of, pneumonia, complications, may, occur, in, particular, in, the, elderly, and, those, with, underlying, health, problems, this, may, include, among, others, empyema, lung, abscess, bronchiolitis, obliterans, acute, respiratory, distress, syndrome, sepsis, and, worsening, of, underlying, health, problems, clinical, prediction, rules, have, been, developed, to, more, objectively, predict, outcomes, of, pneumonia, these, rules, are, often, used, to, decide, whether, to, hospitalize, the, person, in, pneumonia, a, collection, of, fluid, may, form, in, the, space, that, surrounds, the, lung, occasionally, microorganisms, will, infect, this, fluid, causing, an, empyema, to, distinguish, an, empyema, from, the, more, common, simple, parapneumonic, effusion, the, fluid, may, be, collected, with, a, needle, thoracentesis, and, examined, if, this, shows, evidence, of, empyema, complete, drainage, of, the, fluid, is, necessary, often, requiring, a, drainage, catheter, in, severe, cases, of, empyema, surgery, may, be, needed, if, the, infected, fluid, is, not, drained, the, infection, may, persist, because, antibiotics, do, not, penetrate, well, into, the, pleural, cavity, if, the, fluid, is, sterile, it, must, be, drained, only, if, it, is, causing, symptoms, or, remains, unresolved, in, rare, circumstances, bacteria, in, the, lung, will, form, a, pocket, of, infected, fluid, called, a, lung, abscess, lung, abscesses, can, usually, be, seen, with, a, chest, x, ray, but, frequently, require, a, chest, ct, scan, to, confirm, the, diagnosis, abscesses, typically, occur, in, aspiration, pneumonia, and, often, contain, several, types, of, bacteria, long, term, antibiotics, are, usually, adequate, to, treat, a, lung, abscess, but, sometimes, the, abscess, must, be, drained, by, a, surgeon, or, radiologist, pneumonia, can, cause, respiratory, failure, by, triggering, acute, respiratory, distress, syndrome, ards, which, results, from, a, combination, of, infection, and, inflammatory, response, the, lungs, quickly, fill, with, fluid, and, become, stiff, this, stiffness, combined, with, severe, difficulties, extracting, oxygen, due, to, the, alveolar, fluid, may, require, long, periods, of, mechanical, ventilation, for, survival, other, causes, of, circulatory, failure, are, hypoxemia, inflammation, and, increased, coagulability, sepsis, is, a, potential, complication, of, pneumonia, but, usually, occurs, in, people, with, poor, immunity, or, hyposplenism, the, organisms, most, commonly, involved, are, streptococcus, pneumoniae, haemophilus, influenzae, and, klebsiella, pneumoniae, other, causes, of, the, symptoms, should, be, considered, such, as, a, myocardial, infarction, or, a, pulmonary, embolism, pneumonia, is, a, common, illness, affecting, approximately, 450, million, people, a, year, and, occurring, in, all, parts, of, the, world, it, is, a, major, cause, of, death, among, all, age, groups, resulting, in, 4, million, deaths, 7, of, the, world, s, total, death, yearly, rates, are, greatest, in, children, less, than, five, and, adults, older, than, 75, years, it, occurs, about, five, times, more, frequently, in, the, developing, world, than, in, the, developed, world, viral, pneumonia, accounts, for, about, 200, million, cases, in, the, united, states, as, of, 2009, pneumonia, is, the, 8th, leading, cause, of, death, in, 2008, pneumonia, occurred, in, approximately, 156, million, children, 151, million, in, the, developing, world, and, 5, million, in, the, developed, world, in, 2010, it, resulted, in, 1, 3, million, deaths, or, 18, of, all, deaths, in, those, under, five, years, of, which, 95, occurred, in, the, developing, world, countries, with, the, greatest, burden, of, disease, include, india, 43, million, china, 21, million, and, pakistan, 10, million, it, is, the, leading, cause, of, death, among, children, in, low, income, countries, many, of, these, deaths, occur, in, the, newborn, period, the, world, health, organization, estimates, that, one, in, three, newborn, infant, deaths, is, due, to, pneumonia, approximately, half, of, these, deaths, can, be, prevented, as, they, are, caused, by, the, bacteria, for, which, an, effective, vaccine, is, available, the, idsa, has, recommended, that, children, and, infants, with, symptoms, of, cap, should, be, hospitalized, so, they, have, access, to, pediatric, nursing, care, in, 2011, pneumonia, was, the, most, common, reason, for, admission, to, the, hospital, after, an, emergency, department, visit, in, the, u, s, for, infants, and, children, pneumonia, has, been, a, common, disease, throughout, human, history, the, word, is, from, greek, pne, m, n, meaning, lung, the, symptoms, were, described, by, hippocrates, c, 460, 370, bc, peripneumonia, and, pleuritic, affections, are, to, be, thus, observed, if, the, fever, be, acute, and, if, there, be, pains, on, either, side, or, in, both, and, if, expiration, be, if, cough, be, present, and, the, sputa, expectorated, be, of, a, blond, or, livid, color, or, likewise, thin, frothy, and, florid, or, having, any, other, character, different, from, the, common, when, pneumonia, is, at, its, height, the, case, is, beyond, remedy, if, he, is, not, purged, and, it, is, bad, if, he, has, dyspnoea, and, urine, that, is, thin, and, acrid, and, if, sweats, come, out, about, the, neck, and, head, for, such, sweats, are, bad, as, proceeding, from, the, suffocation, rales, and, the, violence, of, the, disease, which, is, obtaining, the, upper, hand, however, hippocrates, referred, to, pneumonia, as, a, disease, named, by, the, ancients, he, also, reported, the, results, of, surgical, drainage, of, empyemas, maimonides, 1135, 1204, ad, observed, the, basic, symptoms, that, occur, in, pneumonia, and, that, are, never, lacking, are, as, follows, acute, fever, sticking, pleuritic, pain, in, the, side, short, rapid, breaths, serrated, pulse, and, cough, this, clinical, description, is, quite, similar, to, those, found, in, modern, textbooks, and, it, reflected, the, extent, of, medical, knowledge, through, the, middle, ages, into, the, 19th, century, edwin, klebs, was, the, first, to, observe, bacteria, in, the, airways, of, persons, having, died, of, pneumonia, in, 1875, initial, work, identifying, the, two, common, bacterial, causes, streptococcus, pneumoniae, and, klebsiella, pneumoniae, was, performed, by, carl, friedl, nder, and, albert, fraenkel, in, 1882, and, 1884, respectively, friedl, nder, s, initial, work, introduced, the, gram, stain, a, fundamental, laboratory, test, still, used, today, to, identify, and, categorize, bacteria, christian, gram, s, paper, describing, the, procedure, in, 1884, helped, to, differentiate, the, two, bacteria, and, showed, that, pneumonia, could, be, caused, by, more, than, one, microorganism, in, 1887, jaccond, demonstrated, pneumonia, may, be, caused, by, opportunistic, bacteria, always, present, in, the, lung, sir, william, osler, known, as, the, father, of, modern, medicine, appreciated, the, death, and, disability, caused, by, pneumonia, describing, it, as, the, captain, of, the, men, of, death, in, 1918, as, it, had, overtaken, tuberculosis, as, one, of, the, leading, causes, of, death, at, the, time, this, phrase, was, originally, coined, by, john, bunyan, in, reference, to, consumption, tuberculosis, osler, also, described, pneumonia, as, the, old, man, s, friend, as, death, was, often, quick, and, painless, when, there, were, much, slower, and, more, painful, ways, to, die, viral, pneumonia, was, first, described, by, hobart, reimann, in, 1938, reimann, chairman, of, the, department, of, medicine, at, jefferson, medical, college, had, established, the, practice, of, routinely, typing, the, pneumococcal, organism, in, cases, where, pneumonia, presented, out, of, this, work, the, distinction, between, viral, and, bacterial, strains, was, noticed, several, developments, in, the, 1900s, improved, the, outcome, for, those, with, pneumonia, with, the, advent, of, penicillin, and, other, antibiotics, modern, surgical, techniques, and, intensive, care, in, the, 20th, century, mortality, from, pneumonia, which, had, approached, 30, dropped, precipitously, in, the, developed, world, vaccination, of, infants, against, haemophilus, influenzae, type, b, began, in, 1988, and, led, to, a, dramatic, decline, in, cases, shortly, thereafter, vaccination, against, streptococcus, pneumoniae, in, adults, began, in, 1977, and, in, children, in, 2000, resulting, in, a, similar, decline, due, to, the, relatively, low, awareness, of, the, disease, 12, november, was, declared, in, 2009, as, the, annual, world, pneumonia, day, a, day, for, concerned, citizens, and, policy, makers, to, take, action, against, the, disease, the, global, economic, cost, of, community, acquired, pneumonia, has, been, estimated, at, 17, billion, annually, other, estimates, are, considerably, higher, in, 2012, the, estimated, aggregate, costs, of, treating, pneumonia, in, the, united, states, were, 20, billion, the, median, cost, of, a, single, pneumonia, related, hospitalization, is, over, 15, 000, according, to, data, released, by, the, centers, for, medicare, and, medicaid, services, average, 2012, hospital, charges, for, inpatient, treatment, of, uncomplicated, pneumonia, in, the, u, s, were, 24, 549, and, ranged, as, high, as, 124, 000, the, average, cost, of, an, emergency, room, consult, for, pneumonia, was, 943, and, the, average, cost, for, medication, was, 66, aggregate, annual, costs, of, treating, pneumonia, in, europe, have, been, estimated, at, 10, billion, footnotes, citations
