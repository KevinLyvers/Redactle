a, cell, wall, is, a, structural, layer, that, surrounds, some, cell, types, found, immediately, outside, the, cell, membrane, it, can, be, tough, flexible, and, sometimes, rigid, primarily, it, provides, the, cell, with, structural, support, shape, protection, and, functions, as, a, selective, barrier, another, vital, role, of, the, cell, wall, is, to, help, the, cell, withstand, osmotic, pressure, and, mechanical, stress, while, absent, in, many, eukaryotes, including, animals, cell, walls, are, prevalent, in, other, organisms, such, as, fungi, algae, and, plants, and, are, commonly, found, in, most, prokaryotes, with, the, exception, of, mollicute, bacteria, the, composition, of, cell, walls, varies, across, taxonomic, groups, species, cell, type, and, the, cell, cycle, in, land, plants, the, primary, cell, wall, comprises, polysaccharides, like, cellulose, hemicelluloses, and, pectin, often, other, polymers, such, as, lignin, suberin, or, cutin, are, anchored, to, or, embedded, in, plant, cell, walls, algae, exhibit, cell, walls, composed, of, glycoproteins, and, polysaccharides, such, as, carrageenan, and, agar, distinct, from, those, in, land, plants, bacterial, cell, walls, contain, peptidoglycan, while, archaeal, cell, walls, vary, in, composition, potentially, consisting, of, glycoprotein, s, layers, pseudopeptidoglycan, or, polysaccharides, fungi, possess, cell, walls, constructed, from, the, polymer, chitin, specifically, n, acetylglucosamine, diatoms, have, a, unique, cell, wall, composed, of, biogenic, silica, a, plant, cell, wall, was, first, observed, and, named, simply, as, a, wall, by, robert, hooke, in, 1665, however, the, dead, excrusion, product, of, the, living, protoplast, was, forgotten, for, almost, three, centuries, being, the, subject, of, scientific, interest, mainly, as, a, resource, for, industrial, processing, or, in, relation, to, animal, or, human, health, in, 1804, karl, rudolphi, and, j, h, f, link, proved, that, cells, had, independent, cell, walls, before, it, had, been, thought, that, cells, shared, walls, and, that, fluid, passed, between, them, this, way, the, mode, of, formation, of, the, cell, wall, was, controversial, in, the, 19th, century, hugo, von, mohl, 1853, 1858, advocated, the, idea, that, the, cell, wall, grows, by, apposition, carl, n, geli, 1858, 1862, 1863, believed, that, the, growth, of, the, wall, in, thickness, and, in, area, was, due, to, a, process, termed, intussusception, each, theory, was, improved, in, the, following, decades, the, apposition, or, lamination, theory, by, eduard, strasburger, 1882, 1889, and, the, intussusception, theory, by, julius, wiesner, 1886, in, 1930, ernst, m, nch, coined, the, term, apoplast, in, order, to, separate, the, living, symplast, from, the, dead, plant, region, the, latter, of, which, included, the, cell, wall, by, the, 1980s, some, authors, suggested, replacing, the, term, cell, wall, particularly, as, it, was, used, for, plants, with, the, more, precise, term, extracellular, matrix, as, used, for, animal, cells, 168, but, others, preferred, the, older, term, cell, walls, serve, similar, purposes, in, those, organisms, that, possess, them, they, may, give, cells, rigidity, and, strength, offering, protection, against, mechanical, stress, the, chemical, composition, and, mechanical, properties, of, the, cell, wall, are, linked, with, plant, cell, growth, and, morphogenesis, in, multicellular, organisms, they, permit, the, organism, to, build, and, hold, a, definite, shape, cell, walls, also, limit, the, entry, of, large, molecules, that, may, be, toxic, to, the, cell, they, further, permit, the, creation, of, stable, osmotic, environments, by, preventing, osmotic, lysis, and, helping, to, retain, water, their, composition, properties, and, form, may, change, during, the, cell, cycle, and, depend, on, growth, conditions, in, most, cells, the, cell, wall, is, flexible, meaning, that, it, will, bend, rather, than, holding, a, fixed, shape, but, has, considerable, tensile, strength, the, apparent, rigidity, of, primary, plant, tissues, is, enabled, by, cell, walls, but, is, not, due, to, the, walls, stiffness, hydraulic, turgor, pressure, creates, this, rigidity, along, with, the, wall, structure, the, flexibility, of, the, cell, walls, is, seen, when, plants, wilt, so, that, the, stems, and, leaves, begin, to, droop, or, in, seaweeds, that, bend, in, water, currents, as, john, howland, explains, think, of, the, cell, wall, as, a, wicker, basket, in, which, a, balloon, has, been, inflated, so, that, it, exerts, pressure, from, the, inside, such, a, basket, is, very, rigid, and, resistant, to, mechanical, damage, thus, does, the, prokaryote, cell, and, eukaryotic, cell, that, possesses, a, cell, wall, gain, strength, from, a, flexible, plasma, membrane, pressing, against, a, rigid, cell, wall, the, apparent, rigidity, of, the, cell, wall, thus, results, from, inflation, of, the, cell, contained, within, this, inflation, is, a, result, of, the, passive, uptake, of, water, in, plants, a, secondary, cell, wall, is, a, thicker, additional, layer, of, cellulose, which, increases, wall, rigidity, additional, layers, may, be, formed, by, lignin, in, xylem, cell, walls, or, suberin, in, cork, cell, walls, these, compounds, are, rigid, and, waterproof, making, the, secondary, wall, stiff, both, wood, and, bark, cells, of, trees, have, secondary, walls, other, parts, of, plants, such, as, the, leaf, stalk, may, acquire, similar, reinforcement, to, resist, the, strain, of, physical, forces, the, primary, cell, wall, of, most, plant, cells, is, freely, permeable, to, small, molecules, including, small, proteins, with, size, exclusion, estimated, to, be, 30, 60, kda, the, ph, is, an, important, factor, governing, the, transport, of, molecules, through, cell, walls, cell, walls, evolved, independently, in, many, groups, the, photosynthetic, eukaryotes, so, called, plant, and, algae, is, one, group, with, cellulose, cell, walls, where, the, cell, wall, is, closely, related, to, the, evolution, of, multicellularity, terrestrialization, and, vascularization, the, cesa, cellulose, synthase, evolved, in, cyanobacteria, and, was, part, of, archaeplastida, since, endosymbiosis, secondary, endosymbiosis, events, transferred, it, with, the, arabinogalactan, proteins, further, into, brown, algae, and, oomycetes, plants, later, evolved, various, genes, from, cesa, including, the, csl, cellulose, synthase, like, family, of, proteins, and, additional, ces, proteins, combined, with, the, various, glycosyltransferases, gt, they, enable, more, complex, chemical, structures, to, be, built, fungi, use, a, chitin, glucan, protein, cell, wall, they, share, the, 1, 3, glucan, synthesis, pathway, with, plants, using, homologous, gt48, family, 1, 3, beta, glucan, synthases, to, perform, the, task, suggesting, that, such, an, enzyme, is, very, ancient, within, the, eukaryotes, their, glycoproteins, are, rich, in, mannose, the, cell, wall, might, have, evolved, to, deter, viral, infections, proteins, embedded, in, cell, walls, are, variable, contained, in, tandem, repeats, subject, to, homologous, recombination, an, alternative, scenario, is, that, fungi, started, with, a, chitin, based, cell, wall, and, later, acquired, the, gt, 48, enzymes, for, the, 1, 3, glucans, via, horizontal, gene, transfer, the, pathway, leading, to, 1, 6, glucan, synthesis, is, not, sufficiently, known, in, either, case, the, walls, of, plant, cells, must, have, sufficient, tensile, strength, to, withstand, internal, osmotic, pressures, of, several, times, atmospheric, pressure, that, result, from, the, difference, in, solute, concentration, between, the, cell, interior, and, external, solutions, plant, cell, walls, vary, from, 0, 1, to, several, m, in, thickness, up, to, three, strata, or, layers, may, be, found, in, plant, cell, walls, in, the, primary, growing, plant, cell, wall, the, major, carbohydrates, are, cellulose, hemicellulose, and, pectin, the, cellulose, microfibrils, are, linked, via, hemicellulosic, tethers, to, form, the, cellulose, hemicellulose, network, which, is, embedded, in, the, pectin, matrix, the, most, common, hemicellulose, in, the, primary, cell, wall, is, xyloglucan, in, grass, cell, walls, xyloglucan, and, pectin, are, reduced, in, abundance, and, partially, replaced, by, glucuronoarabinoxylan, another, type, of, hemicellulose, primary, cell, walls, characteristically, extend, grow, by, a, mechanism, called, acid, growth, mediated, by, expansins, extracellular, proteins, activated, by, acidic, conditions, that, modify, the, hydrogen, bonds, between, pectin, and, cellulose, this, functions, to, increase, cell, wall, extensibility, the, outer, part, of, the, primary, cell, wall, of, the, plant, epidermis, is, usually, impregnated, with, cutin, and, wax, forming, a, permeability, barrier, known, as, the, plant, cuticle, secondary, cell, walls, contain, a, wide, range, of, additional, compounds, that, modify, their, mechanical, properties, and, permeability, the, major, polymers, that, make, up, wood, largely, secondary, cell, walls, include, additionally, structural, proteins, 1, 5, are, found, in, most, plant, cell, walls, they, are, classified, as, hydroxyproline, rich, glycoproteins, hrgp, arabinogalactan, proteins, agp, glycine, rich, proteins, grps, and, proline, rich, proteins, prps, each, class, of, glycoprotein, is, defined, by, a, characteristic, highly, repetitive, protein, sequence, most, are, glycosylated, contain, hydroxyproline, hyp, and, become, cross, linked, in, the, cell, wall, these, proteins, are, often, concentrated, in, specialized, cells, and, in, cell, corners, cell, walls, of, the, epidermis, may, contain, cutin, the, casparian, strip, in, the, endodermis, roots, and, cork, cells, of, plant, bark, contain, suberin, both, cutin, and, suberin, are, polyesters, that, function, as, permeability, barriers, to, the, movement, of, water, the, relative, composition, of, carbohydrates, secondary, compounds, and, proteins, varies, between, plants, and, between, the, cell, type, and, age, plant, cells, walls, also, contain, numerous, enzymes, such, as, hydrolases, esterases, peroxidases, and, transglycosylases, that, cut, trim, and, cross, link, wall, polymers, secondary, walls, especially, in, grasses, may, also, contain, microscopic, silica, crystals, which, may, strengthen, the, wall, and, protect, it, from, herbivores, cell, walls, in, some, plant, tissues, also, function, as, storage, deposits, for, carbohydrates, that, can, be, broken, down, and, resorbed, to, supply, the, metabolic, and, growth, needs, of, the, plant, for, example, endosperm, cell, walls, in, the, seeds, of, cereal, grasses, nasturtium, 228, and, other, species, are, rich, in, glucans, and, other, polysaccharides, that, are, readily, digested, by, enzymes, during, seed, germination, to, form, simple, sugars, that, nourish, the, growing, embryo, the, middle, lamella, is, laid, down, first, formed, from, the, cell, plate, during, cytokinesis, and, the, primary, cell, wall, is, then, deposited, inside, the, middle, lamella, the, actual, structure, of, the, cell, wall, is, not, clearly, defined, and, several, models, exist, the, covalently, linked, cross, model, the, tether, model, the, diffuse, layer, model, and, the, stratified, layer, model, however, the, primary, cell, wall, can, be, defined, as, composed, of, cellulose, microfibrils, aligned, at, all, angles, cellulose, microfibrils, are, produced, at, the, plasma, membrane, by, the, cellulose, synthase, complex, which, is, proposed, to, be, made, of, a, hexameric, rosette, that, contains, three, cellulose, synthase, catalytic, subunits, for, each, of, the, six, units, microfibrils, are, held, together, by, hydrogen, bonds, to, provide, a, high, tensile, strength, the, cells, are, held, together, and, share, the, gelatinous, membrane, the, middle, lamella, which, contains, magnesium, and, calcium, pectates, salts, of, pectic, acid, cells, interact, though, plasmodesmata, which, are, inter, connecting, channels, of, cytoplasm, that, connect, to, the, protoplasts, of, adjacent, cells, across, the, cell, wall, in, some, plants, and, cell, types, after, a, maximum, size, or, point, in, development, has, been, reached, a, secondary, wall, is, constructed, between, the, plasma, membrane, and, primary, wall, unlike, the, primary, wall, the, cellulose, microfibrils, are, aligned, parallel, in, layers, the, orientation, changing, slightly, with, each, additional, layer, so, that, the, structure, becomes, helicoidal, cells, with, secondary, cell, walls, can, be, rigid, as, in, the, gritty, sclereid, cells, in, pear, and, quince, fruit, cell, to, cell, communication, is, possible, through, pits, in, the, secondary, cell, wall, that, allow, plasmodesmata, to, connect, cells, through, the, secondary, cell, walls, there, are, several, groups, of, organisms, that, have, been, called, fungi, some, of, these, groups, oomycete, and, myxogastria, have, been, transferred, out, of, the, kingdom, fungi, in, part, because, of, fundamental, biochemical, differences, in, the, composition, of, the, cell, wall, most, true, fungi, have, a, cell, wall, consisting, largely, of, chitin, and, other, polysaccharides, true, fungi, do, not, have, cellulose, in, their, cell, walls, in, fungi, the, cell, wall, is, the, outer, most, layer, external, to, the, plasma, membrane, the, fungal, cell, wall, is, a, matrix, of, three, main, components, like, plants, algae, have, cell, walls, algal, cell, walls, contain, either, polysaccharides, such, as, cellulose, a, glucan, or, a, variety, of, glycoproteins, volvocales, or, both, the, inclusion, of, additional, polysaccharides, in, algal, cells, walls, is, used, as, a, feature, for, algal, taxonomy, other, compounds, that, may, accumulate, in, algal, cell, walls, include, sporopollenin, and, calcium, ions, the, group, of, algae, known, as, the, diatoms, synthesize, their, cell, walls, also, known, as, frustules, or, valves, from, silicic, acid, significantly, relative, to, the, organic, cell, walls, produced, by, other, groups, silica, frustules, require, less, energy, to, synthesize, approximately, 8, potentially, a, major, saving, on, the, overall, cell, energy, budget, and, possibly, an, explanation, for, higher, growth, rates, in, diatoms, in, brown, algae, phlorotannins, may, be, a, constituent, of, the, cell, walls, the, group, oomycetes, also, known, as, water, molds, are, saprotrophic, plant, pathogens, like, fungi, until, recently, they, were, widely, believed, to, be, fungi, but, structural, and, molecular, evidence, has, led, to, their, reclassification, as, heterokonts, related, to, autotrophic, brown, algae, and, diatoms, unlike, fungi, oomycetes, typically, possess, cell, walls, of, cellulose, and, glucans, rather, than, chitin, although, some, genera, such, as, achlya, and, saprolegnia, do, have, chitin, in, their, walls, the, fraction, of, cellulose, in, the, walls, is, no, more, than, 4, to, 20, far, less, than, the, fraction, of, glucans, oomycete, cell, walls, also, contain, the, amino, acid, hydroxyproline, which, is, not, found, in, fungal, cell, walls, the, dictyostelids, are, another, group, formerly, classified, among, the, fungi, they, are, slime, molds, that, feed, as, unicellular, amoebae, but, aggregate, into, a, reproductive, stalk, and, sporangium, under, certain, conditions, cells, of, the, reproductive, stalk, as, well, as, the, spores, formed, at, the, apex, possess, a, cellulose, wall, the, spore, wall, has, three, layers, the, middle, one, composed, primarily, of, cellulose, while, the, innermost, is, sensitive, to, cellulase, and, pronase, around, the, outside, of, the, cell, membrane, is, the, bacterial, cell, wall, bacterial, cell, walls, are, made, of, peptidoglycan, also, called, murein, which, is, made, from, polysaccharide, chains, cross, linked, by, unusual, peptides, containing, d, amino, acids, bacterial, cell, walls, are, different, from, the, cell, walls, of, plants, and, fungi, which, are, made, of, cellulose, and, chitin, respectively, the, cell, wall, of, bacteria, is, also, distinct, from, that, of, archaea, which, do, not, contain, peptidoglycan, the, cell, wall, is, essential, to, the, survival, of, many, bacteria, although, l, form, bacteria, can, be, produced, in, the, laboratory, that, lack, a, cell, wall, the, antibiotic, penicillin, is, able, to, kill, bacteria, by, preventing, the, cross, linking, of, peptidoglycan, and, this, causes, the, cell, wall, to, weaken, and, lyse, the, lysozyme, enzyme, can, also, damage, bacterial, cell, walls, there, are, broadly, speaking, two, different, types, of, cell, wall, in, bacteria, called, gram, positive, and, gram, negative, the, names, originate, from, the, reaction, of, cells, to, the, gram, stain, a, test, long, employed, for, the, classification, of, bacterial, species, gram, positive, bacteria, possess, a, thick, cell, wall, containing, many, layers, of, peptidoglycan, and, teichoic, acids, gram, negative, bacteria, have, a, relatively, thin, cell, wall, consisting, of, a, few, layers, of, peptidoglycan, surrounded, by, a, second, lipid, membrane, containing, lipopolysaccharides, and, lipoproteins, most, bacteria, have, the, gram, negative, cell, wall, and, only, the, bacillota, and, actinomycetota, previously, known, as, the, low, g, c, and, high, g, c, gram, positive, bacteria, respectively, have, the, alternative, gram, positive, arrangement, these, differences, in, structure, produce, differences, in, antibiotic, susceptibility, the, beta, lactam, antibiotics, e, g, penicillin, cephalosporin, only, work, against, gram, negative, pathogens, such, as, haemophilus, influenzae, or, pseudomonas, aeruginosa, the, glycopeptide, antibiotics, e, g, vancomycin, teicoplanin, telavancin, only, work, against, gram, positive, pathogens, such, as, staphylococcus, aureus, although, not, truly, unique, the, cell, walls, of, archaea, are, unusual, whereas, peptidoglycan, is, a, standard, component, of, all, bacterial, cell, walls, all, archaeal, cell, walls, lack, peptidoglycan, though, some, methanogens, have, a, cell, wall, made, of, a, similar, polymer, called, pseudopeptidoglycan, there, are, four, types, of, cell, wall, currently, known, among, the, archaea, one, type, of, archaeal, cell, wall, is, that, composed, of, pseudopeptidoglycan, also, called, pseudomurein, this, type, of, wall, is, found, in, some, methanogens, such, as, methanobacterium, and, methanothermus, while, the, overall, structure, of, archaeal, pseudo, peptidoglycan, superficially, resembles, that, of, bacterial, peptidoglycan, there, are, a, number, of, significant, chemical, differences, like, the, peptidoglycan, found, in, bacterial, cell, walls, pseudopeptidoglycan, consists, of, polymer, chains, of, glycan, cross, linked, by, short, peptide, connections, however, unlike, peptidoglycan, the, sugar, n, acetylmuramic, acid, is, replaced, by, n, acetyltalosaminuronic, acid, and, the, two, sugars, are, bonded, with, a, 1, 3, glycosidic, linkage, instead, of, 1, 4, additionally, the, cross, linking, peptides, are, l, amino, acids, rather, than, d, amino, acids, as, they, are, in, bacteria, a, second, type, of, archaeal, cell, wall, is, found, in, methanosarcina, and, halococcus, this, type, of, cell, wall, is, composed, entirely, of, a, thick, layer, of, polysaccharides, which, may, be, sulfated, in, the, case, of, halococcus, structure, in, this, type, of, wall, is, complex, and, not, fully, investigated, a, third, type, of, wall, among, the, archaea, consists, of, glycoprotein, and, occurs, in, the, hyperthermophiles, halobacterium, and, some, methanogens, in, halobacterium, the, proteins, in, the, wall, have, a, high, content, of, acidic, amino, acids, giving, the, wall, an, overall, negative, charge, the, result, is, an, unstable, structure, that, is, stabilized, by, the, presence, of, large, quantities, of, positive, sodium, ions, that, neutralize, the, charge, consequently, halobacterium, thrives, only, under, conditions, with, high, salinity, in, other, archaea, such, as, methanomicrobium, and, desulfurococcus, the, wall, may, be, composed, only, of, surface, layer, proteins, known, as, an, s, layer, s, layers, are, common, in, bacteria, where, they, serve, as, either, the, sole, cell, wall, component, or, an, outer, layer, in, conjunction, with, polysaccharides, most, archaea, are, gram, negative, though, at, least, one, gram, positive, member, is, known, many, protists, and, bacteria, produce, other, cell, surface, structures, apart, from, cell, walls, external, extracellular, matrix, or, internal, many, algae, have, a, sheath, or, envelope, of, mucilage, outside, the, cell, made, of, exopolysaccharides, diatoms, build, a, frustule, from, silica, extracted, from, the, surrounding, water, radiolarians, foraminiferans, testate, amoebae, and, silicoflagellates, also, produce, a, skeleton, from, minerals, called, test, in, some, groups, many, green, algae, such, as, halimeda, and, the, dasycladales, and, some, red, algae, the, corallinales, encase, their, cells, in, a, secreted, skeleton, of, calcium, carbonate, in, each, case, the, wall, is, rigid, and, essentially, inorganic, it, is, the, non, living, component, of, cell, some, golden, algae, ciliates, and, choanoflagellates, produces, a, shell, like, protective, outer, covering, called, lorica, some, dinoflagellates, have, a, theca, of, cellulose, plates, and, coccolithophorids, have, coccoliths, an, extracellular, matrix, ecm, is, also, present, in, metazoans, its, composition, varies, between, cells, but, collagens, are, the, most, abundant, protein, in, the, ecm
