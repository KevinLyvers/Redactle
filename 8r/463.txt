others, see, text, coelacanths, s, i, l, k, n, see, l, kanth, order, coelacanthiformes, are, an, ancient, group, of, lobe, finned, fish, sarcopterygii, in, the, class, actinistia, as, sarcopterygians, they, are, more, closely, related, to, lungfish, and, tetrapods, which, includes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, than, to, ray, finned, fish, well, represented, in, both, freshwater, and, marine, fossils, since, the, devonian, they, are, now, represented, by, only, two, extant, marine, species, in, the, genus, latimeria, the, west, indian, ocean, coelacanth, latimeria, chalumnae, primarily, found, near, the, comoro, islands, off, the, east, coast, of, africa, and, the, indonesian, coelacanth, latimeria, menadoensis, the, name, coelacanth, originates, from, the, permian, genus, coelacanthus, which, was, the, first, scientifically, named, coelacanth, the, oldest, known, coelacanth, fossils, date, back, more, than, 410, million, years, coelacanths, were, thought, to, have, become, extinct, in, the, late, cretaceous, around, 66, million, years, ago, but, were, discovered, living, off, the, coast, of, south, africa, in, 1938, the, coelacanth, was, long, considered, a, living, fossil, because, scientists, thought, it, was, the, sole, remaining, member, of, a, taxon, otherwise, known, only, from, fossils, with, no, close, relations, alive, and, that, it, evolved, into, roughly, its, current, form, approximately, 400, million, years, ago, however, several, more, recent, studies, have, shown, that, coelacanth, body, shapes, are, much, more, diverse, than, previously, thought, the, word, coelacanth, is, an, adaptation, of, the, modern, latin, c, lacanthus, hollow, spine, from, the, greek, koilos, hollow, and, akantha, spine, referring, to, the, hollow, caudal, fin, rays, of, the, first, fossil, specimen, described, and, named, by, louis, agassiz, in, 1839, belonging, to, the, genus, coelacanthus, the, genus, name, latimeria, commemorates, marjorie, courtenay, latimer, who, discovered, the, first, specimen, the, earliest, fossils, of, coelacanths, were, discovered, in, the, 19th, century, coelacanths, which, are, related, to, lungfishes, and, tetrapods, were, believed, to, have, become, extinct, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, more, closely, related, to, tetrapods, than, to, the, ray, finned, fish, coelacanths, were, considered, transitional, species, between, fish, and, tetrapods, on, 23, december, 1938, the, first, latimeria, specimen, was, found, off, the, east, coast, of, south, africa, off, the, chalumna, river, now, tyolomnqa, museum, curator, marjorie, courtenay, latimer, discovered, the, fish, among, the, catch, of, a, local, fisherman, courtenay, latimer, contacted, a, rhodes, university, ichthyologist, j, l, b, smith, sending, him, drawings, of, the, fish, and, he, confirmed, the, fish, s, importance, with, a, famous, cable, most, important, preserve, skeleton, and, gills, fish, described, its, discovery, 66, million, years, after, its, supposed, extinction, makes, the, coelacanth, the, best, known, example, of, a, lazarus, taxon, an, evolutionary, line, that, seems, to, have, disappeared, from, the, fossil, record, only, to, reappear, much, later, since, 1938, west, indian, ocean, coelacanth, have, been, found, in, the, comoros, kenya, tanzania, mozambique, madagascar, in, isimangaliso, wetland, park, and, off, the, south, coast, of, kwazulu, natal, in, south, africa, the, comoro, islands, specimen, was, discovered, in, december, 1952, between, 1938, and, 1975, 84, specimens, were, caught, and, recorded, the, second, extant, species, the, indonesian, coelacanth, was, described, from, manado, north, sulawesi, indonesia, in, 1999, by, pouyaud, et, al, based, on, a, specimen, discovered, by, mark, v, erdmann, in, 1998, and, deposited, at, the, indonesian, institute, of, sciences, lipi, erdmann, and, his, wife, arnaz, mehta, first, encountered, a, specimen, at, a, local, market, in, september, 1997, but, took, only, a, few, photographs, of, the, first, specimen, of, this, species, before, it, was, sold, after, confirming, that, it, was, a, unique, discovery, erdmann, returned, to, sulawesi, in, november, 1997, to, interview, fishermen, and, look, for, further, examples, a, second, specimen, was, caught, by, a, fisherman, in, july, 1998, and, was, then, handed, to, erdmann, latimeria, chalumnae, and, l, menadoensis, are, the, only, two, known, living, coelacanth, species, coelacanths, are, large, plump, lobe, finned, fish, that, can, grow, to, more, than, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, and, weigh, around, 90, kg, 200, lb, they, are, estimated, to, live, up, to, 100, years, based, on, analysis, of, annual, growth, marks, on, scales, and, reach, maturity, around, the, age, of, 55, the, oldest, known, specimen, was, 84, years, old, at, the, time, of, its, capture, in, 1960, even, though, their, estimated, lifetime, is, similar, to, humans, gestation, can, last, 5, years, which, is, 1, 5, years, more, than, the, deep, sea, frilled, shark, the, previous, record, holder, they, are, nocturnal, piscivorous, drift, hunters, the, body, is, covered, in, ctenoid, elasmoid, scales, that, act, as, armor, coelacanths, have, eight, fins, two, dorsal, fins, two, pectoral, fins, two, pelvic, fins, one, anal, fin, and, one, caudal, fin, the, tail, is, very, nearly, equally, proportioned, and, is, split, by, a, terminal, tuft, of, fin, rays, that, make, up, its, caudal, lobe, the, eyes, of, the, coelacanth, are, very, large, while, the, mouth, is, very, small, the, eye, is, acclimatized, to, seeing, in, poor, light, by, rods, that, absorb, mostly, short, wavelengths, coelacanth, vision, has, evolved, to, a, mainly, blue, shifted, color, capacity, pseudomaxillary, folds, surround, the, mouth, and, replace, the, maxilla, a, structure, absent, in, coelacanths, two, nostrils, along, with, four, other, external, openings, appear, between, the, premaxilla, and, lateral, rostral, bones, the, nasal, sacs, resemble, those, of, many, other, fish, and, do, not, contain, an, internal, nostril, the, coelacanth, s, rostral, organ, contained, within, the, ethmoid, region, of, the, braincase, has, three, unguarded, openings, into, the, environment, and, is, used, as, a, part, of, the, coelacanth, s, laterosensory, system, the, coelacanth, s, auditory, reception, is, mediated, by, its, inner, ear, which, is, very, similar, to, that, of, tetrapods, and, is, classified, as, being, a, basilar, papilla, coelacanths, are, a, part, of, the, clade, sarcopterygii, or, the, lobe, finned, fishes, they, share, membership, in, this, clade, with, lungfish, and, tetrapods, externally, several, characteristics, distinguish, coelacanths, from, other, lobe, finned, fish, they, possess, a, three, lobed, caudal, fin, also, called, a, trilobate, fin, or, a, diphycercal, tail, a, secondary, tail, extending, past, the, primary, tail, separates, the, upper, and, lower, halves, of, the, coelacanth, ctenoid, elasmoid, scales, act, as, thick, armor, to, protect, the, coelacanth, s, exterior, several, internal, traits, also, aid, in, differentiating, coelacanths, from, other, lobe, finned, fish, at, the, back, of, the, skull, the, coelacanth, possesses, a, hinge, the, intracranial, joint, which, allows, it, to, open, its, mouth, extremely, wide, coelacanths, also, retain, an, oil, filled, notochord, a, hollow, pressurized, tube, which, is, replaced, by, a, vertebral, column, early, in, embryonic, development, in, most, other, vertebrates, the, coelacanth, s, heart, is, shaped, differently, from, that, of, most, modern, fish, with, its, chambers, arranged, in, a, straight, tube, the, coelacanth, s, braincase, is, 98, 5, filled, with, fat, only, 1, 5, of, the, braincase, contains, brain, tissue, the, cheeks, of, the, coelacanth, are, unique, because, the, opercular, bone, is, very, small, and, holds, a, large, soft, tissue, opercular, flap, a, spiracular, chamber, is, present, but, the, spiracle, is, closed, and, never, opens, during, development, also, unique, to, extant, coelacanths, is, the, presence, of, a, fatty, lung, or, a, fat, filled, single, lobed, vestigial, lung, homologous, to, other, fishes, swim, bladders, the, parallel, development, of, a, fatty, organ, for, buoyancy, control, suggests, a, unique, specialization, for, deep, water, habitats, there, are, small, and, hard, but, flexible, plates, around, the, vestigial, lung, in, adult, specimens, though, not, around, the, fatty, organ, the, plates, most, likely, had, a, regulation, function, for, the, volume, of, the, lung, due, to, the, size, of, the, fatty, organ, researchers, assume, that, it, is, responsible, for, the, kidney, s, unusual, relocation, the, two, kidneys, which, are, fused, into, one, are, located, ventrally, within, the, abdominal, cavity, posterior, to, the, cloaca, in, 2013, a, research, group, published, the, genome, sequence, of, the, coelacanth, in, the, scientific, journal, nature, due, to, their, lobed, fins, and, other, features, it, was, once, hypothesized, that, the, coelacanth, might, be, the, youngest, diverging, non, tetrapod, sarcopterygian, but, after, sequencing, the, full, genome, of, the, coelacanth, it, was, discovered, that, the, lungfish, instead, is, more, closely, related, to, tetrapods, coelacanths, and, rhipidistians, the, concestor, of, lungfish, and, tetrapods, had, already, diverged, from, each, other, before, the, lungfish, made, the, transition, to, land, another, important, discovery, made, from, the, genome, sequencing, is, that, the, coelacanths, are, still, evolving, today, while, phenotypic, similarity, between, extant, and, extinct, coelacanths, suggests, there, is, limited, evolutionary, pressure, on, these, organisms, to, undergo, morphological, divergence, they, are, undergoing, measurable, genetic, divergence, despite, prior, studies, showing, that, protein, coding, regions, are, undergoing, evolution, at, a, substitution, rate, much, lower, than, other, sarcopterygians, consistent, with, phenotypic, stasis, observed, between, extant, and, fossil, members, of, the, taxa, the, non, coding, regions, subject, to, higher, transposable, element, activity, show, marked, divergence, even, between, the, two, extant, coelacanth, species, this, has, been, facilitated, in, part, by, a, coelacanth, specific, endogenous, retrovirus, of, the, epsilon, retrovirus, family, cladogram, showing, the, relationships, of, coelacanth, genera, after, torino, soto,

silurian, over, 100, fossil, species, of, coelacanth, have, been, described, the, oldest, identified, coelacanth, fossils, are, around, 420, 410, million, years, old, dating, to, the, early, devonian, coelacanths, were, never, a, diverse, group, in, comparison, to, other, groups, of, fish, and, reached, a, peak, diversity, during, the, early, triassic, 252, 247, million, years, ago, coinciding, with, a, burst, of, diversification, between, the, late, permian, and, middle, triassic, most, mesozoic, coelacanths, belong, to, the, order, latimerioidei, which, contains, two, major, subdivisions, the, marine, latimeriidae, which, contains, modern, coelacanths, as, well, as, the, extinct, mawsoniidae, which, were, native, to, brackish, freshwater, as, well, as, marine, environments, paleozoic, coelacanths, are, generally, small, 30, 40, cm, or, 12, 16, in, in, length, while, mesozoic, forms, were, larger, several, specimens, belonging, to, the, jurassic, and, cretaceous, mawsoniid, coelacanth, genera, trachymetopon, and, mawsonia, likely, reached, or, exceeded, 5, metres, 16, feet, in, length, making, them, amongst, the, largest, known, fishes, of, the, mesozoic, and, amongst, the, largest, bony, fishes, of, all, time, the, most, recent, fossil, latimeriid, is, megalocoelacanthus, dobiei, whose, disarticulated, remains, are, found, in, late, santonian, to, middle, campanian, and, possibly, earliest, maastrichtian, aged, marine, strata, of, the, eastern, and, central, united, states, the, most, recent, mawsoniids, are, axelrodichthys, megadromos, from, early, campanian, to, early, maastrichtian, freshwater, continental, deposits, of, france, as, well, as, an, indeterminate, marine, mawsoniid, from, morocco, dating, to, the, late, maastrichtian, a, small, bone, fragment, from, the, european, paleocene, has, been, considered, the, only, plausible, post, cretaceous, record, but, this, identification, is, based, on, comparative, bone, histology, methods, of, doubtful, reliability, living, coelacanths, have, been, considered, living, fossils, based, on, their, supposedly, conservative, morphology, relative, to, fossil, species, however, recent, studies, have, expressed, the, view, that, coelacanth, morphologic, conservatism, is, a, belief, not, based, on, data, fossils, suggest, that, coelacanths, were, most, morphologically, diverse, during, the, devonian, and, carboniferous, while, mesozoic, species, are, generally, morphologically, similar, to, each, other, the, current, coelacanth, range, is, primarily, along, the, eastern, african, coast, although, latimeria, menadoensis, was, discovered, off, indonesia, coelacanths, have, been, found, in, the, waters, of, kenya, tanzania, mozambique, south, africa, madagascar, comoros, and, indonesia, most, latimeria, chalumnae, specimens, that, have, been, caught, have, been, captured, around, the, islands, of, grande, comore, and, anjouan, in, the, comoros, archipelago, indian, ocean, though, there, are, cases, of, l, chalumnae, caught, elsewhere, amino, acid, sequencing, has, shown, no, big, difference, between, these, exceptions, and, those, found, around, comore, and, anjouan, even, though, these, few, may, be, considered, strays, there, are, several, reports, of, coelacanths, being, caught, off, the, coast, of, madagascar, this, leads, scientists, to, believe, that, the, endemic, range, of, latimeria, chalumnae, coelacanths, stretches, along, the, eastern, coast, of, africa, from, the, comoros, islands, past, the, western, coast, of, madagascar, to, the, south, african, coastline, mitochondrial, dna, sequencing, of, coelacanths, caught, off, the, coast, of, southern, tanzania, suggests, a, divergence, of, the, two, populations, some, 200, 000, years, ago, this, could, refute, the, theory, that, the, comoros, population, is, the, main, population, while, others, represent, recent, offshoots, a, live, specimen, was, seen, and, recorded, on, video, in, november, 2019, at, 69, m, 226, ft, off, the, village, of, umzumbe, on, the, south, coast, of, kwazulu, natal, 325, km, 202, mi, south, of, the, isimangaliso, wetland, park, this, is, the, farthest, south, since, the, original, discovery, and, the, second, shallowest, record, after, 54, m, 177, ft, in, the, diepgat, canyon, these, sightings, suggest, that, they, may, live, shallower, than, previously, thought, at, least, at, the, southern, end, of, their, range, where, colder, better, oxygenated, water, is, available, at, shallower, depths, the, geographical, range, of, the, indonesia, coelacanth, latimeria, menadoensis, is, believed, to, be, off, the, coast, of, manado, tua, island, sulawesi, indonesia, in, the, celebes, sea, key, components, confining, coelacanths, to, these, areas, are, food, and, temperature, restrictions, as, well, as, ecological, requirements, such, as, caves, and, crevices, that, are, well, suited, for, drift, feeding, teams, of, researchers, using, submersibles, have, recorded, live, sightings, of, the, fish, in, the, sulawesi, sea, as, well, as, in, the, waters, of, biak, in, papua, anjouan, island, and, the, grande, comore, provide, ideal, underwater, cave, habitats, for, coelacanths, the, islands, underwater, volcanic, slopes, steeply, eroded, and, covered, in, sand, house, a, system, of, caves, and, crevices, which, allow, coelacanths, resting, places, during, the, daylight, hours, these, islands, support, a, large, benthic, fish, population, that, helps, to, sustain, coelacanth, populations, during, the, daytime, coelacanths, rest, in, caves, anywhere, from, 100, to, 500, meters, 330, to, 1, 640, ft, deep, others, migrate, to, deeper, waters, the, cooler, waters, below, 120, meters, or, 390, feet, reduce, the, coelacanths, metabolic, costs, drifting, toward, reefs, and, night, feeding, saves, vital, energy, resting, in, caves, during, the, day, also, saves, energy, that, otherwise, would, be, expended, to, fight, currents, coelacanth, locomotion, is, unique, to, move, around, they, most, commonly, take, advantage, of, up, or, down, wellings, of, current, and, drift, their, paired, fins, stabilize, movement, through, the, water, while, on, the, ocean, floor, they, do, not, use, the, paired, fins, for, any, kind, of, movement, coelacanths, generate, thrust, with, their, caudal, fins, for, quick, starts, due, to, the, abundance, of, its, fins, the, coelacanth, has, high, maneuverability, and, can, orient, its, body, in, almost, any, direction, in, the, water, they, have, been, seen, doing, headstands, as, well, as, swimming, belly, up, it, is, thought, that, the, rostral, organ, helps, give, the, coelacanth, electroreception, which, aids, in, movement, around, obstacles, coelacanths, are, fairly, peaceful, when, encountering, others, of, their, kind, remaining, calm, even, in, a, crowded, cave, they, do, avoid, body, contact, however, withdrawing, immediately, if, contact, occurs, when, approached, by, foreign, potential, predators, e, g, a, submersible, they, show, panic, flight, reactions, suggesting, that, coelacanths, are, most, likely, prey, to, large, deepwater, predators, shark, bite, marks, have, been, seen, on, coelacanths, sharks, are, common, in, areas, inhabited, by, coelacanths, electrophoresis, testing, of, 14, coelacanth, enzymes, shows, little, genetic, diversity, between, coelacanth, populations, among, the, fish, that, have, been, caught, were, about, equal, numbers, of, males, and, females, population, estimates, range, from, 210, individuals, per, population, to, 500, per, population, because, coelacanths, have, individual, color, markings, scientists, think, that, they, recognize, other, coelacanths, via, electric, communication, coelacanths, are, nocturnal, piscivores, that, feed, mainly, on, benthic, smaller, fish, and, various, cephalopods, they, are, passive, drift, feeders, slowly, drifting, along, currents, with, only, minimal, self, propulsion, eating, whatever, prey, they, encounter, coelacanths, also, use, their, rostral, organ, for, its, electroreception, to, be, able, to, detect, nearby, prey, in, low, light, settings, coelacanths, are, ovoviviparous, meaning, that, the, female, retains, the, fertilized, eggs, within, her, body, while, the, embryos, develop, during, a, gestation, period, of, five, years, typically, females, are, larger, than, the, males, their, scales, and, the, skin, folds, around, the, cloaca, differ, the, male, coelacanth, has, no, distinct, copulatory, organs, just, a, cloaca, which, has, a, urogenital, papilla, surrounded, by, erectile, caruncles, it, is, hypothesized, that, the, cloaca, everts, to, serve, as, a, copulatory, organ, coelacanth, eggs, are, large, with, only, a, thin, layer, of, membrane, to, protect, them, embryos, hatch, within, the, female, and, eventually, are, born, alive, which, is, a, rarity, in, fish, this, was, only, discovered, when, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, dissected, its, first, coelacanth, specimen, in, 1975, and, found, it, pregnant, with, five, embryos, young, coelacanths, resemble, the, adult, the, main, differences, being, an, external, yolk, sac, larger, eyes, relative, to, body, size, and, a, more, pronounced, downward, slope, of, the, body, the, juvenile, coelacanth, s, broad, yolk, sac, hangs, below, the, pelvic, fins, the, scales, and, fins, of, the, juvenile, are, completely, matured, however, it, does, lack, odontodes, which, it, gains, during, maturation, a, study, that, assessed, the, paternity, of, the, embryos, inside, two, coelacanth, females, indicated, that, each, clutch, was, sired, by, a, single, male, this, could, mean, that, females, mate, monandrously, i, e, with, one, male, only, polyandry, female, mating, with, multiple, males, is, common, in, both, plants, and, animals, and, can, be, advantageous, e, g, insurance, against, mating, with, an, infertile, or, incompatible, mate, but, also, confers, costs, increased, risk, of, infection, danger, of, falling, prey, to, predators, increased, energy, input, when, searching, for, new, males, because, little, is, known, about, the, coelacanth, the, conservation, status, is, difficult, to, characterize, according, to, fricke, et, al, 1995, it, is, important, to, conserve, the, species, from, 1988, to, 1994, fricke, counted, some, 60, individuals, of, l, chalumnae, on, each, dive, in, 1995, that, number, dropped, to, 40, even, though, this, could, be, a, result, of, natural, population, fluctuation, it, also, could, be, a, result, of, overfishing, the, iucn, currently, classifies, l, chalumnae, as, critically, endangered, with, a, total, population, size, of, 500, or, fewer, individuals, l, menadoensis, is, considered, vulnerable, with, a, significantly, larger, population, size, fewer, than, 10, 000, individuals, the, major, threat, towards, the, coelacanth, is, the, accidental, capture, by, fishing, operations, especially, commercial, deep, sea, trawling, coelacanths, usually, are, caught, when, local, fishermen, are, fishing, for, oilfish, fishermen, sometimes, snag, a, coelacanth, instead, of, an, oilfish, because, they, traditionally, fish, at, night, when, oilfish, and, coelacanths, feed, before, scientists, became, interested, in, coelacanths, they, were, thrown, back, into, the, water, if, caught, now, that, they, are, recognized, as, important, fishermen, trade, them, to, scientists, or, other, officials, before, the, 1980s, this, was, a, problem, for, coelacanth, populations, in, the, 1980s, international, aid, gave, fiberglass, boats, to, the, local, fishermen, which, moved, fishing, beyond, the, coelacanth, territories, into, more, productive, waters, since, then, most, of, the, motors, on, the, boats, failed, forcing, the, fishermen, back, into, coelacanth, territory, and, putting, the, species, at, risk, again, methods, to, minimize, the, number, of, coelacanths, caught, include, moving, fishers, away, from, the, shore, using, different, laxatives, and, malarial, salves, to, reduce, the, demand, for, oilfish, using, coelacanth, models, to, simulate, live, specimens, and, increasing, awareness, of, the, need, for, conservation, in, 1987, the, coelacanth, conservation, council, advocated, the, conservation, of, coelacanths, the, ccc, has, branches, located, in, comoros, south, africa, canada, the, united, kingdom, the, u, s, japan, and, germany, the, agencies, were, established, to, help, protect, and, encourage, population, growth, of, coelacanths, a, deep, release, kit, was, developed, in, 2014, and, distributed, by, private, initiative, consisting, of, a, weighted, hook, assembly, that, allows, a, fisherman, to, return, an, accidentally, caught, coelacanth, to, deep, waters, where, the, hook, can, be, detached, once, it, hits, the, seafloor, conclusive, reports, about, the, effectiveness, of, this, method, are, still, pending, in, 2002, the, south, african, coelacanth, conservation, and, genome, resource, programme, was, launched, to, help, further, the, studies, and, conservation, of, the, coelacanth, this, program, focuses, on, biodiversity, conservation, evolutionary, biology, capacity, building, and, public, understanding, the, south, african, government, committed, to, spending, r10, million, on, the, program, in, 2011, a, plan, was, made, for, a, tanga, coelacanth, marine, park, to, conserve, biodiversity, for, marine, animals, including, the, coelacanth, the, park, was, designed, to, reduce, habitat, destruction, and, improve, prey, availability, for, endangered, species, coelacanths, are, considered, a, poor, source, of, food, for, humans, and, likely, most, other, fish, eating, animals, coelacanth, flesh, has, large, amounts, of, oil, urea, wax, esters, and, other, compounds, that, give, the, flesh, a, distinctly, unpleasant, flavor, make, it,
