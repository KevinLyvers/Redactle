the, circulatory, system, is, a, system, of, organs, that, includes, the, heart, blood, vessels, and, blood, which, is, circulated, throughout, the, entire, body, of, a, human, or, other, vertebrate, it, includes, the, cardiovascular, system, or, vascular, system, that, consists, of, the, heart, and, blood, vessels, from, greek, kardia, meaning, heart, and, from, latin, vascula, meaning, vessels, the, circulatory, system, has, two, divisions, a, systemic, circulation, or, circuit, and, a, pulmonary, circulation, or, circuit, some, sources, use, the, terms, cardiovascular, system, and, vascular, system, interchangeably, with, circulatory, system, the, network, of, blood, vessels, are, the, great, vessels, of, the, heart, including, large, elastic, arteries, and, large, veins, other, arteries, smaller, arterioles, capillaries, that, join, with, venules, small, veins, and, other, veins, the, circulatory, system, is, closed, in, vertebrates, which, means, that, the, blood, never, leaves, the, network, of, blood, vessels, some, invertebrates, such, as, arthropods, have, an, open, circulatory, system, diploblasts, such, as, sponges, and, comb, jellies, lack, a, circulatory, system, blood, is, a, fluid, consisting, of, plasma, red, blood, cells, white, blood, cells, and, platelets, it, is, circulated, around, the, body, carrying, oxygen, and, nutrients, to, the, tissues, and, collecting, and, disposing, of, waste, materials, circulated, nutrients, include, proteins, and, minerals, and, other, components, include, hemoglobin, hormones, and, gases, such, as, oxygen, and, carbon, dioxide, these, substances, provide, nourishment, help, the, immune, system, to, fight, diseases, and, help, maintain, homeostasis, by, stabilizing, temperature, and, natural, ph, in, vertebrates, the, lymphatic, system, is, complementary, to, the, circulatory, system, the, lymphatic, system, carries, excess, plasma, filtered, from, the, circulatory, system, capillaries, as, interstitial, fluid, between, cells, away, from, the, body, tissues, via, accessory, routes, that, return, excess, fluid, back, to, blood, circulation, as, lymph, the, lymphatic, system, is, a, subsystem, that, is, essential, for, the, functioning, of, the, blood, circulatory, system, without, it, the, blood, would, become, depleted, of, fluid, the, lymphatic, system, also, works, with, the, immune, system, the, circulation, of, lymph, takes, much, longer, than, that, of, blood, and, unlike, the, closed, blood, circulatory, system, the, lymphatic, system, is, an, open, system, some, sources, describe, it, as, a, secondary, circulatory, system, the, circulatory, system, can, be, affected, by, many, cardiovascular, diseases, cardiologists, are, medical, professionals, which, specialise, in, the, heart, and, cardiothoracic, surgeons, specialise, in, operating, on, the, heart, and, its, surrounding, areas, vascular, surgeons, focus, on, disorders, of, the, blood, vessels, and, lymphatic, vessels, the, circulatory, system, includes, the, heart, blood, vessels, and, blood, the, cardiovascular, system, in, all, vertebrates, consists, of, the, heart, and, blood, vessels, the, circulatory, system, is, further, divided, into, two, major, circuits, a, pulmonary, circulation, and, a, systemic, circulation, the, pulmonary, circulation, is, a, circuit, loop, from, the, right, heart, taking, deoxygenated, blood, to, the, lungs, where, it, is, oxygenated, and, returned, to, the, left, heart, the, systemic, circulation, is, a, circuit, loop, that, delivers, oxygenated, blood, from, the, left, heart, to, the, rest, of, the, body, and, returns, deoxygenated, blood, back, to, the, right, heart, via, large, veins, known, as, the, venae, cavae, the, systemic, circulation, can, also, be, defined, as, two, parts, a, macrocirculation, and, a, microcirculation, an, average, adult, contains, five, to, six, quarts, roughly, 4, 7, to, 5, 7, liters, of, blood, accounting, for, approximately, 7, of, their, total, body, weight, blood, consists, of, plasma, red, blood, cells, white, blood, cells, and, platelets, the, digestive, system, also, works, with, the, circulatory, system, to, provide, the, nutrients, the, system, needs, to, keep, the, heart, pumping, further, circulatory, routes, are, associated, such, as, the, coronary, circulation, to, the, heart, itself, the, cerebral, circulation, to, the, brain, renal, circulation, to, the, kidneys, and, bronchial, circulation, to, the, bronchi, in, the, lungs, the, human, circulatory, system, is, closed, meaning, that, the, blood, is, contained, within, the, vascular, network, nutrients, travel, through, tiny, blood, vessels, of, the, microcirculation, to, reach, organs, the, lymphatic, system, is, an, essential, subsystem, of, the, circulatory, system, consisting, of, a, network, of, lymphatic, vessels, lymph, nodes, organs, tissues, and, circulating, lymph, this, subsystem, is, an, open, system, a, major, function, is, to, carry, the, lymph, draining, and, returning, interstitial, fluid, into, the, lymphatic, ducts, back, to, the, heart, for, return, to, the, circulatory, system, another, major, function, is, working, together, with, the, immune, system, to, provide, defense, against, pathogens, the, heart, pumps, blood, to, all, parts, of, the, body, providing, nutrients, and, oxygen, to, every, cell, and, removing, waste, products, the, left, heart, pumps, oxygenated, blood, returned, from, the, lungs, to, the, rest, of, the, body, in, the, systemic, circulation, the, right, heart, pumps, deoxygenated, blood, to, the, lungs, in, the, pulmonary, circulation, in, the, human, heart, there, is, one, atrium, and, one, ventricle, for, each, circulation, and, with, both, a, systemic, and, a, pulmonary, circulation, there, are, four, chambers, in, total, left, atrium, left, ventricle, right, atrium, and, right, ventricle, the, right, atrium, is, the, upper, chamber, of, the, right, side, of, the, heart, the, blood, that, is, returned, to, the, right, atrium, is, deoxygenated, poor, in, oxygen, and, passed, into, the, right, ventricle, to, be, pumped, through, the, pulmonary, artery, to, the, lungs, for, re, oxygenation, and, removal, of, carbon, dioxide, the, left, atrium, receives, newly, oxygenated, blood, from, the, lungs, as, well, as, the, pulmonary, vein, which, is, passed, into, the, strong, left, ventricle, to, be, pumped, through, the, aorta, to, the, different, organs, of, the, body, the, pulmonary, circulation, is, the, part, of, the, circulatory, system, in, which, oxygen, depleted, blood, is, pumped, away, from, the, heart, via, the, pulmonary, artery, to, the, lungs, and, returned, oxygenated, to, the, heart, via, the, pulmonary, vein, oxygen, deprived, blood, from, the, superior, and, inferior, vena, cava, enters, the, right, atrium, of, the, heart, and, flows, through, the, tricuspid, valve, right, atrioventricular, valve, into, the, right, ventricle, from, which, it, is, then, pumped, through, the, pulmonary, semilunar, valve, into, the, pulmonary, artery, to, the, lungs, gas, exchange, occurs, in, the, lungs, whereby, co, 2, is, released, from, the, blood, and, oxygen, is, absorbed, the, pulmonary, vein, returns, the, now, oxygen, rich, blood, to, the, left, atrium, a, separate, circuit, from, the, systemic, circulation, the, bronchial, circulation, supplies, blood, to, the, tissue, of, the, larger, airways, of, the, lung, the, systemic, circulation, is, a, circuit, loop, that, delivers, oxygenated, blood, from, the, left, heart, to, the, rest, of, the, body, through, the, aorta, deoxygenated, blood, is, returned, in, the, systemic, circulation, to, the, right, heart, via, two, large, veins, the, inferior, vena, cava, and, superior, vena, cava, where, it, is, pumped, from, the, right, atrium, into, the, pulmonary, circulation, for, oxygenation, the, systemic, circulation, can, also, be, defined, as, having, two, parts, a, macrocirculation, and, a, microcirculation, the, blood, vessels, of, the, circulatory, system, are, the, arteries, veins, and, capillaries, the, large, arteries, and, veins, that, take, blood, to, and, away, from, the, heart, are, known, as, the, great, vessels, oxygenated, blood, enters, the, systemic, circulation, when, leaving, the, left, ventricle, via, the, aortic, semilunar, valve, the, first, part, of, the, systemic, circulation, is, the, aorta, a, massive, and, thick, walled, artery, the, aorta, arches, and, gives, branches, supplying, the, upper, part, of, the, body, after, passing, through, the, aortic, opening, of, the, diaphragm, at, the, level, of, thoracic, ten, vertebra, it, enters, the, abdomen, later, it, descends, down, and, supplies, branches, to, abdomen, pelvis, perineum, and, the, lower, limbs, the, walls, of, the, aorta, are, elastic, this, elasticity, helps, to, maintain, the, blood, pressure, throughout, the, body, when, the, aorta, receives, almost, five, litres, of, blood, from, the, heart, it, recoils, and, is, responsible, for, pulsating, blood, pressure, as, the, aorta, branches, into, smaller, arteries, their, elasticity, goes, on, decreasing, and, their, compliance, goes, on, increasing, arteries, branch, into, small, passages, called, arterioles, and, then, into, the, capillaries, the, capillaries, merge, to, bring, blood, into, the, venous, system, capillaries, merge, into, venules, which, merge, into, veins, the, venous, system, feeds, into, the, two, major, veins, the, superior, vena, cava, which, mainly, drains, tissues, above, the, heart, and, the, inferior, vena, cava, which, mainly, drains, tissues, below, the, heart, these, two, large, veins, empty, into, the, right, atrium, of, the, heart, the, general, rule, is, that, arteries, from, the, heart, branch, out, into, capillaries, which, collect, into, veins, leading, back, to, the, heart, portal, veins, are, a, slight, exception, to, this, in, humans, the, only, significant, example, is, the, hepatic, portal, vein, which, combines, from, capillaries, around, the, gastrointestinal, tract, where, the, blood, absorbs, the, various, products, of, digestion, rather, than, leading, directly, back, to, the, heart, the, hepatic, portal, vein, branches, into, a, second, capillary, system, in, the, liver, the, heart, itself, is, supplied, with, oxygen, and, nutrients, through, a, small, loop, of, the, systemic, circulation, and, derives, very, little, from, the, blood, contained, within, the, four, chambers, the, coronary, circulation, system, provides, a, blood, supply, to, the, heart, muscle, itself, the, coronary, circulation, begins, near, the, origin, of, the, aorta, by, two, coronary, arteries, the, right, coronary, artery, and, the, left, coronary, artery, after, nourishing, the, heart, muscle, blood, returns, through, the, coronary, veins, into, the, coronary, sinus, and, from, this, one, into, the, right, atrium, backflow, of, blood, through, its, opening, during, atrial, systole, is, prevented, by, the, thebesian, valve, the, smallest, cardiac, veins, drain, directly, into, the, heart, chambers, the, brain, has, a, dual, blood, supply, an, anterior, and, a, posterior, circulation, from, arteries, at, its, front, and, back, the, anterior, circulation, arises, from, the, internal, carotid, arteries, to, supply, the, front, of, the, brain, the, posterior, circulation, arises, from, the, vertebral, arteries, to, supply, the, back, of, the, brain, and, brainstem, the, circulation, from, the, front, and, the, back, join, anastomise, at, the, circle, of, willis, the, neurovascular, unit, composed, of, various, cells, and, vasculature, channels, within, the, brain, regulates, the, flow, of, blood, to, activated, neurons, in, order, to, satisfy, their, high, energy, demands, the, renal, circulation, is, the, blood, supply, to, the, kidneys, contains, many, specialized, blood, vessels, and, receives, around, 20, of, the, cardiac, output, it, branches, from, the, abdominal, aorta, and, returns, blood, to, the, ascending, inferior, vena, cava, the, development, of, the, circulatory, system, starts, with, vasculogenesis, in, the, embryo, the, human, arterial, and, venous, systems, develop, from, different, areas, in, the, embryo, the, arterial, system, develops, mainly, from, the, aortic, arches, six, pairs, of, arches, that, develop, on, the, upper, part, of, the, embryo, the, venous, system, arises, from, three, bilateral, veins, during, weeks, 4, 8, of, embryogenesis, fetal, circulation, begins, within, the, 8th, week, of, development, fetal, circulation, does, not, include, the, lungs, which, are, bypassed, via, the, truncus, arteriosus, before, birth, the, fetus, obtains, oxygen, and, nutrients, from, the, mother, through, the, placenta, and, the, umbilical, cord, the, human, arterial, system, originates, from, the, aortic, arches, and, from, the, dorsal, aortae, starting, from, week, 4, of, embryonic, life, the, first, and, second, aortic, arches, regress, and, form, only, the, maxillary, arteries, and, stapedial, arteries, respectively, the, arterial, system, itself, arises, from, aortic, arches, 3, 4, and, 6, aortic, arch, 5, completely, regresses, the, dorsal, aortae, present, on, the, dorsal, side, of, the, embryo, are, initially, present, on, both, sides, of, the, embryo, they, later, fuse, to, form, the, basis, for, the, aorta, itself, approximately, thirty, smaller, arteries, branch, from, this, at, the, back, and, sides, these, branches, form, the, intercostal, arteries, arteries, of, the, arms, and, legs, lumbar, arteries, and, the, lateral, sacral, arteries, branches, to, the, sides, of, the, aorta, will, form, the, definitive, renal, suprarenal, and, gonadal, arteries, finally, branches, at, the, front, of, the, aorta, consist, of, the, vitelline, arteries, and, umbilical, arteries, the, vitelline, arteries, form, the, celiac, superior, and, inferior, mesenteric, arteries, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, after, birth, the, umbilical, arteries, will, form, the, internal, iliac, arteries, the, human, venous, system, develops, mainly, from, the, vitelline, veins, the, umbilical, veins, and, the, cardinal, veins, all, of, which, empty, into, the, sinus, venosus, about, 98, 5, of, the, oxygen, in, a, sample, of, arterial, blood, in, a, healthy, human, breathing, air, at, sea, level, pressure, is, chemically, combined, with, hemoglobin, molecules, about, 1, 5, is, physically, dissolved, in, the, other, blood, liquids, and, not, connected, to, hemoglobin, the, hemoglobin, molecule, is, the, primary, transporter, of, oxygen, in, vertebrates, many, diseases, affect, the, circulatory, system, these, include, a, number, of, cardiovascular, diseases, affecting, the, heart, and, blood, vessels, hematologic, diseases, that, affect, the, blood, such, as, anemia, and, lymphatic, diseases, affecting, the, lymphatic, system, cardiologists, are, medical, professionals, which, specialise, in, the, heart, and, cardiothoracic, surgeons, specialise, in, operating, on, the, heart, and, its, surrounding, areas, vascular, surgeons, focus, on, the, blood, vessels, diseases, affecting, the, cardiovascular, system, are, called, cardiovascular, disease, many, of, these, diseases, are, called, lifestyle, diseases, because, they, develop, over, time, and, are, related, to, a, person, s, exercise, habits, diet, whether, they, smoke, and, other, lifestyle, choices, a, person, makes, atherosclerosis, is, the, precursor, to, many, of, these, diseases, it, is, where, small, atheromatous, plaques, build, up, in, the, walls, of, medium, and, large, arteries, this, may, eventually, grow, or, rupture, to, occlude, the, arteries, it, is, also, a, risk, factor, for, acute, coronary, syndromes, which, are, diseases, that, are, characterised, by, a, sudden, deficit, of, oxygenated, blood, to, the, heart, tissue, atherosclerosis, is, also, associated, with, problems, such, as, aneurysm, formation, or, splitting, dissection, of, arteries, another, major, cardiovascular, disease, involves, the, creation, of, a, clot, called, a, thrombus, these, can, originate, in, veins, or, arteries, deep, venous, thrombosis, which, mostly, occurs, in, the, legs, is, one, cause, of, clots, in, the, veins, of, the, legs, particularly, when, a, person, has, been, stationary, for, a, long, time, these, clots, may, embolise, meaning, travel, to, another, location, in, the, body, the, results, of, this, may, include, pulmonary, embolus, transient, ischaemic, attacks, or, stroke, cardiovascular, diseases, may, also, be, congenital, in, nature, such, as, heart, defects, or, persistent, fetal, circulation, where, the, circulatory, changes, that, are, supposed, to, happen, after, birth, do, not, not, all, congenital, changes, to, the, circulatory, system, are, associated, with, diseases, a, large, number, are, anatomical, variations, the, function, and, health, of, the, circulatory, system, and, its, parts, are, measured, in, a, variety, of, manual, and, automated, ways, these, include, simple, methods, such, as, those, that, are, part, of, the, cardiovascular, examination, including, the, taking, of, a, person, s, pulse, as, an, indicator, of, a, person, s, heart, rate, the, taking, of, blood, pressure, through, a, sphygmomanometer, or, the, use, of, a, stethoscope, to, listen, to, the, heart, for, murmurs, which, may, indicate, problems, with, the, heart, s, valves, an, electrocardiogram, can, also, be, used, to, evaluate, the, way, in, which, electricity, is, conducted, through, the, heart, other, more, invasive, means, can, also, be, used, a, cannula, or, catheter, inserted, into, an, artery, may, be, used, to, measure, pulse, pressure, or, pulmonary, wedge, pressures, angiography, which, involves, injecting, a, dye, into, an, artery, to, visualise, an, arterial, tree, can, be, used, in, the, heart, coronary, angiography, or, brain, at, the, same, time, as, the, arteries, are, visualised, blockages, or, narrowings, may, be, fixed, through, the, insertion, of, stents, and, active, bleeds, may, be, managed, by, the, insertion, of, coils, an, mri, may, be, used, to, image, arteries, called, an, mri, angiogram, for, evaluation, of, the, blood, supply, to, the, lungs, a, ct, pulmonary, angiogram, may, be, used, vascular, ultrasonography, may, be, used, to, investigate, vascular, diseases, affecting, the, venous, system, and, the, arterial, system, including, the, diagnosis, of, stenosis, thrombosis, or, venous, insufficiency, an, intravascular, ultrasound, using, a, catheter, is, also, an, option, there, are, a, number, of, surgical, procedures, performed, on, the, circulatory, system, cardiovascular, procedures, are, more, likely, to, be, performed, in, an, inpatient, setting, than, in, an, ambulatory, care, setting, in, the, united, states, only, 28, of, cardiovascular, surgeries, were, performed, in, the, ambulatory, care, setting, while, humans, as, well, as, other, vertebrates, have, a, closed, blood, circulatory, system, meaning, that, the, blood, never, leaves, the, network, of, arteries, veins, and, capillaries, some, invertebrate, groups, have, an, open, circulatory, system, containing, a, heart, but, limited, blood, vessels, the, most, primitive, diploblastic, animal, phyla, lack, circulatory, systems, an, additional, transport, system, the, lymphatic, system, which, is, only, found, in, animals, with, a, closed, blood, circulation, is, an, open, system, providing, an, accessory, route, for, excess, interstitial, fluid, to, be, returned, to, the, blood, the, blood, vascular, system, first, appeared, probably, in, an, ancestor, of, the, triploblasts, over, 600, million, years, ago, overcoming, the, time, distance, constraints, of, diffusion, while, endothelium, evolved, in, an, ancestral, vertebrate, some, 540, 510, million, years, ago, in, arthropods, the, open, circulatory, system, is, a, system, in, which, a, fluid, in, a, cavity, called, the, hemocoel, bathes, the, organs, directly, with, oxygen, and, nutrients, with, there, being, no, distinction, between, blood, and, interstitial, fluid, this, combined, fluid, is, called, hemolymph, or, haemolymph, muscular, movements, by, the, animal, during, locomotion, can, facilitate, hemolymph, movement, but, diverting, flow, from, one, area, to, another, is, limited, when, the, heart, relaxes, blood, is, drawn, back, toward, the, heart, through, open, ended, pores, ostia, hemolymph, fills, all, of, the, interior, hemocoel, of, the, body, and, surrounds, all, cells, hemolymph, is, composed, of, water, inorganic, salts, mostly, sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium, and, calcium, and, organic, compounds, mostly, carbohydrates, proteins, and, lipids, the, primary, oxygen, transporter, molecule, is, hemocyanin, there, are, free, floating, cells, the, hemocytes, within, the, hemolymph, they, play, a, role, in, the, arthropod, immune, system, the, circulatory, systems, of, all, vertebrates, as, well, as, of, annelids, for, example, earthworms, and, cephalopods, squids, octopuses, and, relatives, always, keep, their, circulating, blood, enclosed, within, heart, chambers, or, blood, vessels, and, are, classified, as, closed, just, as, in, humans, still, the, systems, of, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and, birds, show, various, stages, of, the, evolution, of, the, circulatory, system, closed, systems, permit, blood, to, be, directed, to, the, organs, that, require, it, in, fish, the, system, has, only, one, circuit, with, the, blood, being, pumped, through, the, capillaries, of, the, gills, and, on, to, the, capillaries, of, the, body, tissues, this, is, known, as, single, cycle, circulation, the, heart, of, fish, is, therefore, only, a, single, pump, consisting, of, two, chambers, in, amphibians, and, most, reptiles, a, double, circulatory, system, is, used, but, the, heart, is, not, always, completely, separated, into, two, pumps, amphibians, have, a, three, chambered, heart, in, reptiles, the, ventricular, septum, of, the, heart, is, incomplete, and, the, pulmonary, artery, is, equipped, with, a, sphincter, muscle, this, allows, a, second, possible, route, of, blood, flow, instead, of, blood, flowing, through, the, pulmonary, artery, to, the, lungs, the, sphincter, may, be, contracted, to, divert, this, blood, flow, through, the, incomplete, ventricular, septum, into, the, left, ventricle, and, out, through, the, aorta, this, means, the, blood, flows, from, the, capillaries, to, the, heart, and, back, to, the, capillaries, instead, of, to, the, lungs, this, process, is, useful, to, ectothermic, cold, blooded, animals, in, the, regulation, of, their, body, temperature, mammals, birds, and, crocodilians, show, complete, separation, of, the, heart, into, two, pumps, for, a, total, of, four, heart, chambers, it, is, thought, that, the, four, chambered, heart, of, birds, and, crocodilians, evolved, independently, from, that, of, mammals, double, circulatory, systems, permit, blood, to, be, repressurized, after, returning, from, the, lungs, speeding, up, delivery, of, oxygen, to, tissues, circulatory, systems, are, absent, in, some, animals, including, flatworms, their, body, cavity, has, no, lining, or, enclosed, fluid, instead, a, muscular, pharynx, leads, to, an, extensively, branched, digestive, system, that, facilitates, direct, diffusion, of, nutrients, to, all, cells, the, flatworm, s, dorso, ventrally, flattened, body, shape, also, restricts, the, distance, of, any, cell, from, the, digestive, system, or, the, exterior, of, the, organism, oxygen, can, diffuse, from, the, surrounding, water, into, the, cells, and, carbon, dioxide, can, diffuse, out, consequently, every, cell, is, able, to, obtain, nutrients, water, and, oxygen, without, the, need, of, a, transport, system, some, animals, such, as, jellyfish, have, more, extensive, branching, from, their, gastrovascular, cavity, which, functions, as, both, a, place, of, digestion, and, a, form, of, circulation, this, branching, allows, for, bodily, fluids, to, reach, the, outer, layers, since, the, digestion, begins, in, the, inner, layers, the, earliest, known, writings, on, the, circulatory, system, are, found, in, the, ebers, papyrus, 16th, century, bce, an, ancient, egyptian, medical, papyrus, containing, over, 700, prescriptions, and, remedies, both, physical, and, spiritual, in, the, papyrus, it, acknowledges, the, connection, of, the, heart, to, the, arteries, the, egyptians, thought, air, came, in, through, the, mouth, and, into, the, lungs, and, heart, from, the, heart, the, air, travelled, to, every, member, through, the, arteries, although, this, concept, of, the, circulatory, system, is, only, partially, correct, it, represents, one, of, the, earliest, accounts, of, scientific, thought, in, the, 6th, century, bce, the, knowledge, of, circulation, of, vital, fluids, through, the, body, was, known, to, the, ayurvedic, physician, sushruta, in, ancient, india, he, also, seems, to, have, possessed, knowledge, of, the, arteries, described, as, channels, by, dwivedi, dwivedi, 2007, the, valves, of, the, heart, were, discovered, by, a, physician, of, the, hippocratean, school, around, the, 4th, century, bce, however, their, function, was, not, properly, understood, then, because, blood, pools, in, the, veins, after, death, arteries, look, empty, ancient, anatomists, assumed, they, were, filled, with, air, and, that, they, were, for, the, transport, of, air, the, greek, physician, herophilus, distinguished, veins, from, arteries, but, thought, that, the, pulse, was, a, property, of, arteries, themselves, greek, anatomist, erasistratus, observed, that, arteries, that, were, cut, during, life, bleed, he, ascribed, the, fact, to, the, phenomenon, that, air, escaping, from, an, artery, is, replaced, with, blood, that, enters, between, veins, and, arteries, by, very, small, vessels, thus, he, apparently, postulated, capillaries, but, with, reversed, flow, of, blood, in, 2nd, century, ad, rome, the, greek, physician, galen, knew, that, blood, vessels, carried, blood, and, identified, venous, dark, red, and, arterial, brighter, and, thinner, blood, each, with, distinct, and, separate, functions, growth, and, energy, were, derived, from, venous, blood, created, in, the, liver, from, chyle, while, arterial, blood, gave, vitality, by, containing, pneuma, air, and, originated, in, the, heart, blood, flowed, from, both, creating, organs, to, all, parts, of, the, body, where, it, was, consumed, and, there, was, no, return, of, blood, to, the, heart, or, liver, the, heart, did, not, pump, blood, around, the, heart, s, motion, sucked, blood, in, during, diastole, and, the, blood, moved, by, the, pulsation, of, the, arteries, themselves, galen, believed, that, the, arterial, blood, was, created, by, venous, blood, passing, from, the, left, ventricle, to, the, right, by, passing, through, pores, in, the, interventricular, septum, air, passed, from, the, lungs, via, the, pulmonary, artery, to, the, left, side, of, the, heart, as, the, arterial, blood, was, created, sooty, vapors, were, created, and, passed, to, the, lungs, also, via, the, pulmonary, artery, to, be, exhaled, in, 1025, the, canon, of, medicine, by, the, persian, physician, avicenna, erroneously, accepted, the, greek, notion, regarding, the, existence, of, a, hole, in, the, ventricular, septum, by, which, the, blood, traveled, between, the, ventricles, despite, this, avicenna, correctly, wrote, on, the, cardiac, cycles, and, valvular, function, and, had, a, vision, of, blood, circulation, in, his, treatise, on, pulse, while, also, refining, galen, s, erroneous, theory, of, the, pulse, avicenna, provided, the, first, correct, explanation, of, pulsation, every, beat, of, the, pulse, comprises, two, movements, and, two, pauses, thus, expansion, pause, contraction, pause, the, pulse, is, a, movement, in, the, heart, and, arteries, which, takes, the, form, of, alternate, expansion, and, contraction, in, 1242, the, arabian, physician, ibn, al, nafis, described, the, process, of, pulmonary, circulation, in, greater, more, accurate, detail, than, his, predecessors, though, he, believed, as, they, did, in, the, notion, of, vital, spirit, pneuma, which, he, believed, was, formed, in, the, left, ventricle, ibn, al, nafis, stated, in, his, commentary, on, anatomy, in, avicenna, s, canon, the, blood, from, the, right, chamber, of, the, heart, must, arrive, at, the, left, chamber, but, there, is, no, direct, pathway, between, them, the, thick, septum, of, the, heart, is, not, perforated, and, does, not, have, visible, pores, as, some, people, thought, or, invisible, pores, as, galen, thought, the, blood, from, the, right, chamber, must, flow, through, the, vena, arteriosa, pulmonary, artery, to, the, lungs, spread, through, its, substances, be, mingled, there, with, air, pass, through, the, arteria, venosa, pulmonary, vein, to, reach, the, left, chamber, of, the, heart, and, there, form, the, vital, spirit, in, addition, ibn, al, nafis, had, an, insight, into, what, would, become, a, larger, theory, of, the, capillary, circulation, he, stated, that, there, must, be, small, communications, or, pores, manafidh, in, arabic, between, the, pulmonary, artery, and, vein, a, prediction, that, preceded, the, discovery, of, the, capillary, system, by, more, than, 400, years, ibn, al, nafis, theory, however, was, confined, to, blood, transit, in, the, lungs, and, did, not, extend, to, the, entire, body, michael, servetus, was, the, first, european, to, describe, the, function, of, pulmonary, circulation, although, his, achievement, was, not, widely, recognized, at, the, time, for, a, few, reasons, he, firstly, described, it, in, the, manuscript, of, paris, near, 1546, but, this, work, was, never, published, and, later, he, published, this, description, but, in, a, theological, treatise, christianismi, restitutio, not, in, a, book, on, medicine, only, three, copies, of, the, book, survived, but, these, remained, hidden, for, decades, the, rest, were, burned, shortly, after, its, publication, in, 1553, because, of, persecution, of, servetus, by, religious, authorities, a, better, known, discovery, of, pulmonary, circulation, was, by, vesalius, s, successor, at, padua, realdo, colombo, in, 1559, finally, the, english, physician, william, harvey, a, pupil, of, hieronymus, fabricius, who, had, earlier, described, the, valves, of, the, veins, without, recognizing, their, function, performed, a, sequence, of, experiments, and, published, his, exercitatio, anatomica, de, motu, cordis, et, sanguinis, in, animalibus, in, 1628, which, demonstrated, that, there, had, to, be, a, direct, connection, between, the, venous, and, arterial, systems, throughout, the, body, and, not, just, the, lungs, most, importantly, he, argued, that, the, beat, of, the, heart, produced, a, continuous, circulation, of, blood, through, minute, connections, at, the, extremities, of, the, body, this, is, a, conceptual, leap, that, was, quite, different, from, ibn, al, nafis, refinement, of, the, anatomy, and, bloodflow, in, the, heart, and, lungs, this, work, with, its, essentially, correct, exposition, slowly, convinced, the, medical, world, however, harvey, was, not, able, to, identify, the, capillary, system, connecting, arteries, and, veins, these, were, later, discovered, by, marcello, malpighi, in, 1661
