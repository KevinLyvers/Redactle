a, lyrebird, is, either, of, two, species, of, ground, dwelling, australian, birds, that, compose, the, genus, menura, and, the, family, menuridae, they, are, most, notable, for, their, impressive, ability, to, mimic, natural, and, artificial, sounds, from, their, environment, and, the, striking, beauty, of, the, male, bird, s, huge, tail, when, it, is, fanned, out, in, courtship, display, lyrebirds, have, unique, plumes, of, neutral, coloured, tailfeathers, and, are, among, australia, s, best, known, native, birds, the, classification, of, lyrebirds, was, the, subject, of, much, debate, after, the, first, specimens, reached, european, scientists, after, 1798, based, on, specimens, sent, from, new, south, wales, to, england, major, general, thomas, davies, illustrated, and, described, this, species, as, the, superb, lyrebird, which, he, called, menura, superba, in, an, 1800, presentation, to, the, linnean, society, of, london, but, this, work, was, not, published, until, 1802, in, the, intervening, time, period, however, the, species, was, described, and, named, menura, novaehollandiae, by, john, latham, in, 1801, and, this, is, the, accepted, name, by, virtue, of, nomenclatural, priority, the, genus, name, menura, refers, to, the, pattern, of, repeated, transparent, crescents, or, lunules, on, the, superb, lyrebird, s, outer, tail, feathers, from, the, ancient, greek, words, m, n, moon, and, our, tail, lyrebirds, are, named, because, their, outer, tail, feathers, are, broad, and, curved, in, a, s, shape, that, together, resemble, the, shape, of, a, lyre, 2, 18, lyrebirds, were, thought, to, be, galliformes, like, the, broadly, similar, looking, partridge, junglefowl, and, pheasants, familiar, to, europeans, reflected, in, the, early, names, given, to, the, superb, lyrebird, including, native, pheasant, they, were, also, called, peacock, wrens, and, australian, birds, of, paradise, the, idea, that, they, were, related, to, the, pheasants, was, abandoned, when, the, first, chicks, which, are, altricial, were, described, they, were, not, classed, with, the, passerines, until, a, paper, was, published, in, 1840, twelve, years, after, they, were, assigned, a, discrete, family, menuridae, within, that, family, they, compose, a, single, genus, menura, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, lyrebird, family, is, most, closely, related, to, the, scrub, birds, atrichornithidae, and, some, authorities, combine, both, in, a, single, family, but, evidence, that, they, are, also, related, to, the, bowerbirds, remains, controversial, lyrebirds, are, ancient, australian, animals, the, australian, museum, has, fossils, of, lyrebirds, dating, back, to, about, 15, million, years, ago, the, prehistoric, menura, tyawanoides, has, been, described, from, early, miocene, fossils, found, at, the, famous, riversleigh, site, two, species, of, lyrebird, are, extant, the, lyrebirds, are, large, passerine, birds, amongst, the, largest, in, the, order, they, are, ground, living, birds, with, strong, legs, and, feet, and, short, rounded, wings, they, are, poor, fliers, and, rarely, fly, except, for, periods, of, downhill, gliding, the, superb, lyrebird, is, the, larger, of, the, two, species, lyrebirds, measure, 31, to, 39, inches, in, length, including, their, tail, males, tend, to, be, slightly, larger, than, females, females, weigh, around, 2, pounds, and, males, weigh, around, 2, 4, pounds, the, superb, lyrebird, is, found, in, areas, of, rainforest, in, victoria, new, south, wales, and, south, east, queensland, it, is, also, found, in, tasmania, where, it, was, introduced, in, the, 19th, century, many, superb, lyrebirds, live, in, the, dandenong, ranges, national, park, and, kinglake, national, park, around, melbourne, the, royal, national, park, and, illawarra, region, south, of, sydney, in, many, other, parks, along, the, east, coast, of, australia, and, non, protected, bushland, albert, s, lyrebird, is, found, only, in, a, small, area, of, southern, queensland, rainforest, lyrebirds, are, shy, and, difficult, to, approach, particularly, the, albert, s, lyrebird, with, the, result, that, little, information, about, its, behaviour, has, been, documented, when, lyrebirds, detect, potential, danger, they, pause, and, scan, the, surroundings, sound, an, alarm, and, either, flee, the, area, on, foot, or, seek, cover, and, freeze, firefighters, sheltering, in, mine, shafts, during, bushfires, have, been, joined, by, lyrebirds, lyrebirds, feed, on, the, ground, and, as, individuals, a, range, of, invertebrate, prey, is, taken, including, insects, such, as, cockroaches, beetles, both, adults, and, larvae, earwigs, fly, larvae, and, the, adults, and, larvae, of, moths, other, prey, taken, includes, centipedes, spiders, earthworms, less, commonly, taken, prey, includes, stick, insects, bugs, amphipods, lizards, frogs, and, occasionally, seeds, they, find, food, by, scratching, with, their, feet, through, the, leaf, litter, lyrebirds, are, long, lived, birds, that, can, live, as, long, as, 30, years, they, have, long, breeding, cycles, and, start, breeding, later, in, life, than, other, passerine, birds, female, superb, lyrebirds, start, breeding, at, the, age, of, five, or, six, and, males, at, the, age, of, six, to, eight, males, defend, territories, from, other, males, and, those, territories, may, contain, the, breeding, territories, of, up, to, eight, females, within, the, male, territories, the, males, create, or, use, display, platforms, for, the, superb, lyrebird, this, is, a, mound, of, bare, soil, for, the, albert, s, lyrebird, it, is, a, pile, of, twigs, on, the, forest, floor, male, lyrebirds, call, mostly, during, winter, when, they, construct, and, maintain, an, open, arena, mound, in, dense, bush, on, which, they, sing, and, dance, in, an, elaborate, courtship, display, performed, for, potential, mates, of, which, the, male, lyrebird, has, several, the, strength, volume, and, location, of, the, nest, built, by, the, female, lyrebird, is, dependent, on, the, rainfall, and, predation, during, the, nest, building, period, it, is, important, for, the, nest, to, be, water, resistant, and, hidden, in, secluded, areas, so, predators, cannot, attack, once, the, nest, is, made, in, the, preferred, location, the, female, lyrebird, lays, a, single, egg, the, egg, is, incubated, over, 50, days, solely, by, the, female, and, the, female, also, fosters, the, chick, alone, a, lyrebird, s, song, is, one, of, the, more, distinctive, aspects, of, its, behavioural, biology, lyrebirds, sing, throughout, the, year, but, the, peak, of, the, breeding, season, from, june, to, august, is, when, they, sing, with, the, most, intensity, during, this, peak, males, may, sing, for, four, hours, of, the, day, almost, half, the, hours, of, daylight, the, song, of, the, lyrebird, is, a, mixture, of, elements, of, its, own, song, and, mimicry, of, other, species, lyrebirds, render, with, great, fidelity, the, individual, songs, of, other, birds, and, the, chatter, of, flocks, of, birds, and, also, mimic, other, animals, such, as, possums, koalas, and, dingoes, lyrebirds, have, been, recorded, mimicking, human, sounds, such, as, a, mill, whistle, a, cross, cut, saw, chainsaws, car, engines, and, car, alarms, fire, alarms, rifle, shots, camera, shutters, dogs, barking, crying, babies, music, mobile, phone, ring, tones, and, even, the, human, voice, however, while, the, mimicry, of, human, noises, is, widely, reported, the, extent, to, which, it, happens, is, exaggerated, and, the, phenomenon, is, unusual, parts, of, the, lyrebird, s, own, song, can, resemble, human, made, sound, effects, which, has, given, rise, to, the, urban, legend, that, they, frequently, imitate, video, game, or, film, sounds, the, superb, lyrebird, s, mimicked, calls, are, learned, from, the, local, environment, including, from, other, superb, lyrebirds, an, instructive, example, is, the, population, of, superb, lyrebirds, in, tasmania, which, have, retained, the, calls, of, species, not, native, to, tasmania, in, their, repertoire, with, some, local, tasmanian, endemic, bird, songs, added, the, female, lyrebirds, of, both, species, are, also, mimics, capable, of, complex, vocalisations, superb, lyrebird, females, are, silent, during, courtship, however, they, regularly, produce, sophisticated, vocal, displays, during, foraging, and, nest, defense, a, recording, of, a, superb, lyrebird, mimicking, sounds, of, an, electronic, shooting, game, workmen, and, chainsaws, was, added, to, the, national, film, and, sound, archive, s, sounds, of, australia, registry, in, 2013, both, species, of, lyrebird, produced, elaborate, lyrebird, specific, vocalisations, including, whistle, songs, males, also, sing, songs, specifically, associated, with, their, song, and, dance, displays, one, researcher, sydney, curtis, has, recorded, flute, like, lyrebird, calls, in, the, vicinity, of, the, new, england, national, park, similarly, in, 1969, a, park, ranger, neville, fenton, recorded, a, lyrebird, song, which, resembled, flute, sounds, in, the, new, england, national, park, near, dorrigo, in, northern, coastal, new, south, wales, after, much, detective, work, by, fenton, it, was, discovered, that, in, the, 1930s, a, flute, player, living, on, a, farm, adjoining, the, park, used, to, play, tunes, near, his, pet, lyrebird, the, lyrebird, adopted, the, tunes, into, his, repertoire, and, retained, them, after, release, into, the, park, neville, fenton, forwarded, a, tape, of, his, recording, to, norman, robinson, because, a, lyrebird, is, able, to, carry, two, tunes, at, the, same, time, robinson, filtered, out, one, of, the, tunes, and, put, it, on, the, phonograph, for, the, purposes, of, analysis, one, witness, suggested, that, the, song, represents, a, modified, version, of, two, popular, tunes, in, the, 1930s, the, keel, row, and, mosquito, s, dance, musicologist, david, rothenberg, has, endorsed, this, information, however, a, flute, lyrebird, research, group, including, curtis, and, fenton, formed, to, investigate, the, veracity, of, this, story, found, no, evidence, of, mosquito, dance, and, only, remnants, of, keel, row, in, contemporary, and, historical, lyrebird, recordings, from, this, area, neither, were, they, able, to, prove, that, a, lyrebird, chick, had, been, a, pet, although, they, acknowledged, compelling, evidence, on, both, sides, of, the, argument, until, the, 2019, 2020, australian, bushfire, season, superb, lyrebirds, were, not, considered, threatened, in, the, short, to, medium, term, concern, has, since, grown, as, early, analyses, have, shown, the, extent, of, destruction, of, the, lyrebird, s, preferred, wet, forest, habitats, which, in, less, intense, previous, bushfire, seasons, have, been, spared, in, large, part, due, to, their, moisture, content, albert, s, lyrebird, has, a, very, restricted, habitat, and, had, been, listed, as, vulnerable, by, the, iucn, but, because, the, species, and, its, habitat, were, carefully, managed, the, species, was, re, assessed, to, near, threatened, in, 2009, the, superb, lyrebird, had, already, been, seriously, threatened, by, habitat, destruction, in, the, past, its, population, had, since, recovered, but, the, 2019, 2020, bushfires, damaged, much, of, its, habitat, which, may, lead, to, a, reclassification, of, its, status, from, common, to, threatened, beyond, this, new, threat, are, the, long, term, vulnerabilities, to, predation, by, cats, and, foxes, as, well, as, human, population, pressure, on, its, habitat, the, lyrebird, is, so, called, because, the, male, bird, has, a, spectacular, tail, consisting, of, 16, highly, modified, feathers, two, long, slender, lyrates, at, the, centre, of, the, plume, two, broader, medians, on, the, outside, edges, and, twelve, filamentaries, arrayed, between, them, which, was, originally, thought, to, resemble, a, lyre, this, happened, when, a, superb, lyrebird, specimen, which, had, been, taken, from, australia, to, england, during, the, early, 19th, century, was, prepared, for, display, at, the, british, museum, by, a, taxidermist, who, had, never, seen, a, live, lyrebird, the, taxidermist, mistakenly, thought, that, the, tail, would, resemble, a, lyre, and, that, the, tail, would, be, held, in, a, similar, way, to, that, of, a, peacock, during, courtship, display, and, so, he, arranged, the, feathers, in, this, way, later, john, gould, who, had, also, never, seen, a, live, lyrebird, painted, the, lyrebird, from, the, british, museum, specimen, the, male, lyrebird, s, tail, is, not, held, as, in, john, gould, s, painting, instead, the, male, lyrebird, s, tail, is, fanned, over, the, lyrebird, during, courtship, display, with, the, tail, completely, covering, his, head, and, back, as, can, be, seen, in, the, image, in, the, breeding, section, of, this, page, and, also, the, image, of, the, 10, cent, coin, where, the, superb, lyrebird, s, tail, in, courtship, display, is, portrayed, accurately, the, lyrebird, has, been, featured, as, a, symbol, and, emblem, many, times, especially, in, new, south, wales, and, victoria, where, the, superb, lyrebird, has, its, natural, habitat, and, in, queensland, where, albert, s, lyrebird, has, its, natural, habitat
