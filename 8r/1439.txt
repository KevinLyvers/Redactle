visual, or, vision, impairment, vi, or, vip, is, the, partial, or, total, inability, of, visual, perception, in, the, absence, of, treatment, such, as, corrective, eyewear, assistive, devices, and, medical, treatment, visual, impairment, may, cause, the, individual, difficulties, with, normal, daily, tasks, including, reading, and, walking, the, terms, low, vision, and, blindness, are, often, used, for, levels, of, impairment, which, are, difficult, or, impossible, to, correct, and, significantly, impact, daily, life, in, addition, to, the, various, permanent, conditions, fleeting, temporary, vision, impairment, amaurosis, fugax, may, occur, and, may, indicate, serious, medical, problems, the, most, common, causes, of, visual, impairment, globally, are, uncorrected, refractive, errors, 43, cataracts, 33, and, glaucoma, 2, refractive, errors, include, near, sightedness, far, sightedness, presbyopia, and, astigmatism, cataracts, are, the, most, common, cause, of, blindness, other, disorders, that, may, cause, visual, problems, include, age, related, macular, degeneration, diabetic, retinopathy, corneal, clouding, childhood, blindness, and, a, number, of, infections, visual, impairment, can, also, be, caused, by, problems, in, the, brain, due, to, stroke, premature, birth, or, trauma, among, others, these, cases, are, known, as, cortical, visual, impairment, screening, for, vision, problems, in, children, may, improve, future, vision, and, educational, achievement, screening, adults, without, symptoms, is, of, uncertain, benefit, diagnosis, is, by, an, eye, exam, the, world, health, organization, who, estimates, that, 80, of, visual, impairment, is, either, preventable, or, curable, with, treatment, this, includes, cataracts, the, infections, river, blindness, and, trachoma, glaucoma, diabetic, retinopathy, uncorrected, refractive, errors, and, some, cases, of, childhood, blindness, many, people, with, significant, visual, impairment, benefit, from, vision, rehabilitation, changes, in, their, environment, and, assistive, devices, as, of, 2015, there, were, 940, million, people, with, some, degree, of, vision, loss, 246, million, had, low, vision, and, 39, million, were, blind, the, majority, of, people, with, poor, vision, are, in, the, developing, world, and, are, over, the, age, of, 50, years, rates, of, visual, impairment, have, decreased, since, the, 1990s, visual, impairments, have, considerable, economic, costs, both, directly, due, to, the, cost, of, treatment, and, indirectly, due, to, decreased, ability, to, work, in, 2010, the, who, definition, for, visual, impairment, was, changed, and, now, follows, the, icd, 11, the, previous, definition, which, used, best, corrected, visual, acuity, was, changed, to, presenting, visual, acuity, this, change, was, made, as, newer, studies, showed, that, best, corrected, vision, overlooks, a, larger, proportion, of, the, population, who, has, visual, impairment, due, to, uncorrected, refractive, errors, and, or, lack, of, access, to, medical, or, surgical, treatment, distance, vision, impairment, near, vision, impairment, severely, sight, impaired, sight, impaired, low, vision, in, the, uk, the, certificate, of, vision, impairment, cvi, is, used, to, certify, patients, as, severely, sight, impaired, or, sight, impaired, the, accompanying, guidance, for, clinical, staff, states, the, national, assistance, act, 1948, states, that, a, person, can, be, certified, as, severely, sight, impaired, if, they, are, so, blind, as, to, be, unable, to, perform, any, work, for, which, eye, sight, is, essential, certification, is, based, on, whether, a, person, can, do, any, work, for, which, eyesight, is, essential, not, just, one, particular, job, such, as, their, job, before, becoming, blind, in, practice, the, definition, depends, on, individuals, visual, acuity, and, the, extent, to, which, their, field, of, vision, is, restricted, the, department, of, health, identifies, three, groups, of, people, who, may, be, classified, as, severely, visually, impaired, the, department, of, health, also, state, that, a, person, is, more, likely, to, be, classified, as, severely, visually, impaired, if, their, eyesight, has, failed, recently, or, if, they, are, an, older, individual, both, groups, being, perceived, as, less, able, to, adapt, to, their, vision, loss, in, the, united, states, any, person, with, vision, that, cannot, be, corrected, to, better, than, 20, 200, in, the, better, eye, or, who, has, 20, degrees, diameter, or, less, of, visual, field, remaining, is, considered, legally, blind, or, eligible, for, disability, classification, and, possible, inclusion, in, certain, government, sponsored, programs, the, terms, partially, sighted, low, vision, legally, blind, and, totally, blind, are, used, by, schools, colleges, and, other, educational, institutions, to, describe, students, with, visual, impairments, they, are, defined, as, follows, in, 1934, the, american, medical, association, adopted, the, following, definition, of, blindness, central, visual, acuity, of, 20, 200, or, less, in, the, better, eye, with, corrective, glasses, or, central, visual, acuity, of, more, than, 20, 200, if, there, is, a, visual, field, defect, in, which, the, peripheral, field, is, contracted, to, such, an, extent, that, the, widest, diameter, of, the, visual, field, subtends, an, angular, distance, no, greater, than, 20, degrees, in, the, better, eye, the, united, states, congress, included, this, definition, as, part, of, the, aid, to, the, blind, program, in, the, social, security, act, passed, in, 1935, in, 1972, the, aid, to, the, blind, program, and, two, others, combined, under, title, xvi, of, the, social, security, act, to, form, the, supplemental, security, income, program, which, states, an, individual, shall, be, considered, to, be, blind, for, purposes, of, this, title, if, he, has, central, visual, acuity, of, 20, 200, or, less, in, the, better, eye, with, the, use, of, a, correcting, lens, an, eye, which, is, accompanied, by, a, limitation, in, the, fields, of, vision, such, that, the, widest, diameter, of, the, visual, field, subtends, an, angle, no, greater, than, 20, degrees, shall, be, considered, for, purposes, of, the, first, sentence, of, this, subsection, as, having, a, central, visual, acuity, of, 20, 200, or, less, an, individual, shall, also, be, considered, to, be, blind, for, purposes, of, this, title, if, he, is, blind, as, defined, under, a, state, plan, approved, under, title, x, or, xvi, as, in, effect, for, october, 1972, and, received, aid, under, such, plan, on, the, basis, of, blindness, for, december, 1973, so, long, as, he, is, continuously, blind, as, so, defined, vision, impairment, for, a, few, seconds, or, minutes, may, occur, due, to, any, of, a, variety, of, causes, some, serious, and, requiring, medical, attention, visual, impairments, may, take, many, forms, and, be, of, varying, degrees, visual, acuity, alone, is, not, always, a, good, predictor, of, an, individual, s, function, someone, with, relatively, good, acuity, e, g, 20, 40, can, have, difficulty, with, daily, functioning, while, someone, with, worse, acuity, e, g, 20, 200, may, function, reasonably, well, if, they, have, low, visual, demands, best, corrected, visual, acuity, differs, from, presenting, visual, acuity, a, person, with, a, normal, best, corrected, acuity, can, have, poor, presenting, acuity, e, g, individual, who, has, uncorrected, refractive, error, thus, measuring, an, individual, s, general, functioning, depends, on, one, s, situational, and, contextual, factors, as, well, as, access, to, treatment, the, american, medical, association, has, estimated, that, the, loss, of, one, eye, equals, 25, impairment, of, the, visual, system, and, 24, impairment, of, the, whole, person, total, loss, of, vision, in, both, eyes, is, considered, to, be, 100, visual, impairment, and, 85, impairment, of, the, whole, person, some, people, who, fall, into, this, category, can, use, their, considerable, residual, vision, their, remaining, sight, to, complete, daily, tasks, without, relying, on, alternative, methods, the, role, of, a, low, vision, specialist, optometrist, or, ophthalmologist, is, to, maximize, the, functional, level, of, a, patient, s, vision, by, optical, or, non, optical, means, primarily, this, is, by, use, of, magnification, in, the, form, of, telescopic, systems, for, distance, vision, and, optical, or, electronic, magnification, for, near, tasks, people, with, significantly, reduced, acuity, may, benefit, from, training, conducted, by, individuals, trained, in, the, provision, of, technical, aids, low, vision, rehabilitation, professionals, some, of, whom, are, connected, to, an, agency, for, the, blind, can, provide, advice, on, lighting, and, contrast, to, maximize, remaining, vision, these, professionals, also, have, access, to, non, visual, aids, and, can, instruct, patients, in, their, uses, older, adults, with, visual, impairment, are, at, an, increased, risk, of, physical, inactivity, slower, gait, speeds, and, fear, of, falls, physical, activity, is, a, useful, predictor, of, overall, well, being, and, routine, physical, activity, reduces, the, risk, of, developing, chronic, diseases, and, disability, older, adults, with, visual, impairment, including, glaucoma, age, related, macular, degeneration, and, diabetic, retinopathy, have, decreased, physical, activity, as, measured, with, self, reports, and, accelerometers, the, us, national, health, and, nutrition, examination, survey, nhanes, showed, that, people, with, corrected, visual, acuity, of, less, than, 20, 40, spent, significantly, less, time, in, moderate, to, vigorous, physical, activity, age, related, macular, degeneration, is, also, associated, with, a, 50, decrease, in, physical, activity, however, physical, activity, is, protective, against, age, related, macular, degeneration, progression, in, terms, of, mobility, those, with, visual, impairment, have, a, slower, gait, speed, than, those, without, visual, impairment, however, the, rate, of, decline, remains, proportional, with, increasing, age, in, both, groups, additionally, the, visually, impaired, also, have, greater, difficulty, walking, a, quarter, mile, 400, m, and, walking, up, stairs, as, compared, to, those, with, normal, vision, older, adults, with, vision, loss, are, at, an, increased, risk, of, memory, loss, cognitive, impairment, and, cognitive, decline, studies, demonstrate, an, association, between, older, adults, with, visual, impairment, and, a, poor, mental, health, discrimination, was, identified, as, one, of, the, causes, of, this, association, older, adults, with, visual, impairment, have, a, 1, 5, fold, risk, of, reporting, perceived, discrimination, and, of, these, individuals, there, was, a, 2, fold, risk, of, loneliness, and, 4, fold, risk, of, reporting, a, lower, quality, of, life, among, adults, with, visual, impairment, the, prevalence, of, moderate, loneliness, is, 28, 7, 18, 2, in, general, population, and, prevalence, of, severe, loneliness, is, 19, 7, 2, 7, in, general, population, the, risk, of, depression, and, anxiety, are, also, increased, in, the, visually, impaired, 32, 2, report, depressive, symptoms, 12, 01, in, general, population, and, 15, 61, report, anxiety, symptoms, 10, 69, in, general, population, the, subjects, making, the, most, use, of, rehabilitation, instruments, who, lived, alone, and, preserved, their, own, mobility, and, occupation, were, the, least, depressed, with, the, lowest, risk, of, suicide, and, the, highest, level, of, social, integration, those, with, worsening, sight, and, the, prognosis, of, eventual, blindness, are, at, comparatively, high, risk, of, suicide, and, thus, may, be, in, need, of, supportive, services, many, studies, have, demonstrated, how, rapid, acceptance, of, the, serious, visual, impairment, has, led, to, a, better, more, productive, compliance, with, rehabilitation, programs, moreover, psychological, distress, has, been, reported, to, be, at, its, highest, when, sight, loss, is, not, complete, but, the, prognosis, is, unfavorable, therefore, early, intervention, is, imperative, for, enabling, successful, psychological, adjustment, blindness, can, occur, in, combination, with, such, conditions, as, intellectual, disability, autism, spectrum, disorders, cerebral, palsy, hearing, impairments, and, epilepsy, blindness, in, combination, with, hearing, loss, is, known, as, deafblindness, it, has, been, estimated, that, over, half, of, completely, blind, people, have, non, 24, hour, sleep, wake, disorder, a, condition, in, which, a, person, s, circadian, rhythm, normally, slightly, longer, than, 24, hours, is, not, entrained, synchronized, to, the, light, dark, cycle, the, most, common, causes, of, visual, impairment, globally, in, 2010, were, the, most, common, causes, of, blindness, worldwide, in, 2010, were, about, 90, of, people, who, are, visually, impaired, live, in, the, developing, world, age, related, macular, degeneration, glaucoma, and, diabetic, retinopathy, are, the, leading, causes, of, blindness, in, the, developed, world, among, working, age, adults, who, are, newly, blind, in, england, and, wales, the, most, common, causes, in, 2010, were, cataracts, are, the, greying, or, opacity, of, the, crystalline, lens, which, can, be, caused, in, children, by, intrauterine, infections, metabolic, disorders, and, genetically, transmitted, syndromes, cataracts, are, the, leading, cause, of, child, and, adult, blindness, that, doubles, in, prevalence, with, every, ten, years, after, the, age, of, 40, consequently, today, cataracts, are, more, common, among, adults, than, in, children, that, is, people, face, higher, chances, of, developing, cataracts, as, they, age, nonetheless, cataracts, tend, to, have, a, greater, financial, and, emotional, toll, upon, children, as, they, must, undergo, expensive, diagnosis, long, term, rehabilitation, and, visual, assistance, also, according, to, the, saudi, journal, for, health, sciences, sometimes, patients, experience, irreversible, amblyopia, after, pediatric, cataract, surgery, because, the, cataracts, prevented, the, normal, maturation, of, vision, prior, to, operation, despite, the, great, progress, in, treatment, cataracts, remain, a, global, problem, in, both, economically, developed, and, developing, countries, at, present, with, the, variant, outcomes, as, well, as, the, unequal, access, to, cataract, surgery, the, best, way, to, reduce, the, risk, of, developing, cataracts, is, to, avoid, smoking, and, extensive, exposure, to, sun, light, i, e, uv, b, rays, glaucoma, is, an, eye, disease, often, characterized, by, increased, pressure, within, the, eye, or, intraocular, pressure, iop, glaucoma, causes, visual, field, loss, as, well, as, severs, the, optic, nerve, early, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, glaucoma, in, patients, is, imperative, because, glaucoma, is, triggered, by, non, specific, levels, of, iop, also, another, challenge, in, accurately, diagnosing, glaucoma, is, that, the, disease, has, four, causes, 1, inflammatory, ocular, hypertension, syndrome, iohs, 2, severe, uveitic, angle, closure, 3, corticosteroid, induced, and, 4, a, heterogonous, mechanism, associated, with, structural, change, and, chronic, inflammation, in, addition, often, pediatric, glaucoma, differs, greatly, in, cause, and, management, from, the, glaucoma, developed, by, adults, currently, the, best, sign, of, pediatric, glaucoma, is, an, iop, of, 21, mm, hg, or, greater, present, within, a, child, one, of, the, most, common, causes, of, pediatric, glaucoma, is, cataract, removal, surgery, which, leads, to, an, incidence, rate, of, about, 12, 2, among, infants, and, 58, 7, among, 10, year, olds, childhood, blindness, can, be, caused, by, conditions, related, to, pregnancy, such, as, congenital, rubella, syndrome, and, retinopathy, of, prematurity, leprosy, and, onchocerciasis, each, blind, approximately, 1, million, individuals, in, the, developing, world, the, number, of, individuals, blind, from, trachoma, has, decreased, in, the, past, 10, years, from, 6, million, to, 1, 3, million, putting, it, in, seventh, place, on, the, list, of, causes, of, blindness, worldwide, central, corneal, ulceration, is, also, a, significant, cause, of, monocular, blindness, worldwide, accounting, for, an, estimated, 850, 000, cases, of, corneal, blindness, every, year, in, the, indian, subcontinent, alone, as, a, result, corneal, scarring, from, all, causes, is, now, the, fourth, greatest, cause, of, global, blindness, eye, injuries, most, often, occurring, in, people, under, 30, are, the, leading, cause, of, monocular, blindness, vision, loss, in, one, eye, throughout, the, united, states, injuries, and, cataracts, affect, the, eye, itself, while, abnormalities, such, as, optic, nerve, hypoplasia, affect, the, nerve, bundle, that, sends, signals, from, the, eye, to, the, back, of, the, brain, which, can, lead, to, decreased, visual, acuity, cortical, blindness, results, from, injuries, to, the, occipital, lobe, of, the, brain, that, prevent, the, brain, from, correctly, receiving, or, interpreting, signals, from, the, optic, nerve, symptoms, of, cortical, blindness, vary, greatly, across, individuals, and, may, be, more, severe, in, periods, of, exhaustion, or, stress, it, is, common, for, people, with, cortical, blindness, to, have, poorer, vision, later, in, the, day, blinding, has, been, used, as, an, act, of, vengeance, and, torture, in, some, instances, to, deprive, a, person, of, a, major, sense, by, which, they, can, navigate, or, interact, within, the, world, act, fully, independently, and, be, aware, of, events, surrounding, them, an, example, from, the, classical, realm, is, oedipus, who, gouges, out, his, own, eyes, after, realizing, that, he, fulfilled, the, awful, prophecy, spoken, of, him, having, crushed, the, bulgarians, the, byzantine, emperor, basil, ii, blinded, as, many, as, 15, 000, prisoners, taken, in, the, battle, before, releasing, them, contemporary, examples, include, the, addition, of, methods, such, as, acid, throwing, as, a, form, of, disfigurement, people, with, albinism, often, have, vision, loss, to, the, extent, that, many, are, legally, blind, though, few, of, them, actually, cannot, see, leber, congenital, amaurosis, can, cause, total, blindness, or, severe, sight, loss, from, birth, or, early, childhood, retinitis, pigmentosa, is, characterized, by, decreased, peripheral, vision, and, trouble, seeing, at, night, advances, in, mapping, of, the, human, genome, have, identified, other, genetic, causes, of, low, vision, or, blindness, one, such, example, is, bardet, biedl, syndrome, rarely, blindness, is, caused, by, the, intake, of, certain, chemicals, a, well, known, example, is, methanol, which, is, only, mildly, toxic, and, minimally, intoxicating, and, breaks, down, into, the, substances, formaldehyde, and, formic, acid, which, in, turn, can, cause, blindness, an, array, of, other, health, complications, and, death, when, competing, with, ethanol, for, metabolism, ethanol, is, metabolized, first, and, the, onset, of, toxicity, is, delayed, methanol, is, commonly, found, in, methylated, spirits, denatured, ethyl, alcohol, to, avoid, paying, taxes, on, selling, ethanol, intended, for, human, consumption, methylated, spirits, are, sometimes, used, by, alcoholics, as, a, desperate, and, cheap, substitute, for, regular, ethanol, alcoholic, beverages, it, is, important, that, people, be, examined, by, someone, specializing, in, low, vision, care, prior, to, other, rehabilitation, training, to, rule, out, potential, medical, or, surgical, correction, for, the, problem, and, to, establish, a, careful, baseline, refraction, and, prescription, of, both, normal, and, low, vision, glasses, and, optical, aids, only, a, doctor, is, qualified, to, evaluate, visual, functioning, of, a, compromised, visual, system, effectively, the, american, medical, association, provides, an, approach, to, evaluating, visual, loss, as, it, affects, an, individual, s, ability, to, perform, activities, of, daily, living, screening, adults, who, have, no, symptoms, is, of, uncertain, benefit, the, world, health, organization, estimates, that, 80, of, visual, loss, is, either, preventable, or, curable, with, treatment, this, includes, cataracts, onchocerciasis, trachoma, glaucoma, diabetic, retinopathy, uncorrected, refractive, errors, and, some, cases, of, childhood, blindness, the, center, for, disease, control, and, prevention, estimates, that, half, of, blindness, in, the, united, states, is, preventable, many, people, with, serious, visual, impairments, can, travel, independently, using, a, wide, range, of, tools, and, techniques, orientation, and, mobility, specialists, are, professionals, who, are, specifically, trained, to, teach, people, with, visual, impairments, how, to, travel, safely, confidently, and, independently, in, the, home, and, the, community, these, professionals, can, also, help, blind, people, to, practice, travelling, on, specific, routes, which, they, may, use, often, such, as, the, route, from, one, s, house, to, a, convenience, store, becoming, familiar, with, an, environment, or, route, can, make, it, much, easier, for, a, blind, person, to, navigate, successfully, tools, such, as, the, white, cane, with, a, red, tip, the, international, symbol, of, blindness, may, also, be, used, to, improve, mobility, a, long, cane, is, used, to, extend, the, user, s, range, of, touch, sensation, it, is, usually, swung, in, a, low, sweeping, motion, across, the, intended, path, of, travel, to, detect, obstacles, however, techniques, for, cane, travel, can, vary, depending, on, the, user, and, or, the, situation, some, visually, impaired, persons, do, not, carry, these, kinds, of, canes, opting, instead, for, the, shorter, lighter, identification, id, cane, still, others, require, a, support, cane, the, choice, depends, on, the, individual, s, vision, motivation, and, other, factors, a, small, number, of, people, employ, guide, dogs, to, assist, in, mobility, these, dogs, are, trained, to, navigate, around, various, obstacles, and, to, indicate, when, it, becomes, necessary, to, go, up, or, down, a, step, however, the, helpfulness, of, guide, dogs, is, limited, by, the, inability, of, dogs, to, understand, complex, directions, the, human, half, of, the, guide, dog, team, does, the, directing, based, upon, skills, acquired, through, previous, mobility, training, in, this, sense, the, handler, might, be, likened, to, an, aircraft, s, navigator, who, must, know, how, to, get, from, one, place, to, another, and, the, dog, to, the, pilot, who, gets, them, there, safely, gps, devices, can, also, be, used, as, a, mobility, aid, such, software, can, assist, blind, people, with, orientation, and, navigation, but, it, is, not, a, replacement, for, traditional, mobility, tools, such, as, white, canes, and, guide, dogs, some, blind, people, are, skilled, at, echolocating, silent, objects, simply, by, producing, mouth, clicks, and, listening, to, the, returning, echoes, it, has, been, shown, that, blind, echolocation, experts, use, what, is, normally, the, visual, part, of, their, brain, to, process, the, echoes, government, actions, are, sometimes, taken, to, make, public, places, more, accessible, to, blind, people, public, transportation, is, freely, available, to, blind, people, in, many, cities, tactile, paving, and, audible, traffic, signals, can, make, it, easier, and, safer, for, visually, impaired, pedestrians, to, cross, streets, in, addition, to, making, rules, about, who, can, and, cannot, use, a, cane, some, governments, mandate, the, right, of, way, be, given, to, users, of, white, canes, or, guide, dogs, most, visually, impaired, people, who, are, not, totally, blind, read, print, either, of, a, regular, size, or, enlarged, by, magnification, devices, many, also, read, large, print, which, is, easier, for, them, to, read, without, such, devices, a, variety, of, magnifying, glasses, some, handheld, and, some, on, desktops, can, make, reading, easier, for, them, others, read, braille, or, the, infrequently, used, moon, type, or, rely, on, talking, books, and, readers, or, reading, machines, which, convert, printed, text, to, speech, or, braille, they, use, computers, with, special, hardware, such, as, scanners, and, refreshable, braille, displays, as, well, as, software, written, specifically, for, the, blind, such, as, optical, character, recognition, applications, and, screen, readers, some, people, access, these, materials, through, agencies, for, the, blind, such, as, the, national, library, service, for, the, blind, and, physically, handicapped, in, the, united, states, the, national, library, for, the, blind, or, the, rnib, in, the, united, kingdom, closed, circuit, televisions, equipment, that, enlarges, and, contrasts, textual, items, are, a, more, high, tech, alternative, to, traditional, magnification, devices, there, are, also, over, 100, radio, reading, services, throughout, the, world, that, provide, people, with, vision, impairments, with, readings, from, periodicals, over, the, radio, the, international, association, of, audio, information, services, provides, links, to, all, of, these, organizations, access, technology, such, as, screen, readers, screen, magnifiers, and, refreshable, braille, displays, enable, the, blind, to, use, mainstream, computer, applications, and, mobile, phones, the, availability, of, assistive, technology, is, increasing, accompanied, by, concerted, efforts, to, ensure, the, accessibility, of, information, technology, to, all, potential, users, including, the, blind, later, versions, of, microsoft, windows, include, an, accessibility, wizard, magnifier, for, those, with, partial, vision, and, microsoft, narrator, a, simple, screen, reader, linux, distributions, as, live, cds, for, the, blind, include, vinux, and, adriane, knoppix, the, latter, developed, in, part, by, adriane, knopper, who, has, a, visual, impairment, macos, and, ios, also, come, with, a, built, in, screen, reader, called, voiceover, while, google, talkback, is, built, in, to, most, android, devices, the, movement, towards, greater, web, accessibility, is, opening, a, far, wider, number, of, websites, to, adaptive, technology, making, the, web, a, more, inviting, place, for, visually, impaired, surfers, experimental, approaches, in, sensory, substitution, are, beginning, to, provide, access, to, arbitrary, live, views, from, a, camera, modified, visual, output, that, includes, large, print, and, or, clear, simple, graphics, can, be, of, benefit, to, users,
