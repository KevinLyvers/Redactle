carnivora, k, r, n, v, r, kar, niv, r, is, an, order, of, placental, mammals, that, have, specialized, in, primarily, eating, flesh, whose, members, are, formally, referred, to, as, carnivorans, the, order, carnivora, is, the, sixth, largest, order, of, mammals, comprising, at, least, 279, species, on, every, major, landmass, and, in, a, variety, of, habitats, ranging, from, the, cold, polar, regions, of, earth, to, the, hyper, arid, region, of, the, sahara, desert, and, the, open, seas, these, mammals, have, a, large, array, of, diverse, body, plans, with, a, wide, diversity, of, shapes, and, sizes, carnivora, are, divided, into, two, suborders, the, feliformia, containing, the, true, felids, and, several, cat, like, animals, and, the, caniformia, containing, the, true, canids, and, many, dog, like, animals, the, feliforms, include, the, felidae, viverridae, hyena, and, mongoose, families, the, majority, of, which, live, only, in, the, old, world, cats, are, the, only, exception, occurring, in, the, old, world, and, the, new, world, entering, the, americas, via, the, bering, land, bridge, the, caniforms, include, the, caninae, procyonidae, bears, mustelids, skunks, and, pinnipeds, that, occur, worldwide, with, immense, diversity, in, their, morphology, diet, and, behavior, the, word, carnivore, is, derived, from, latin, car, stem, carn, flesh, and, vor, re, to, devour, and, refers, to, any, meat, eating, organism, the, oldest, known, carnivoran, line, mammals, carnivoramorpha, appeared, in, north, america, 6, million, years, after, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, these, early, ancestors, of, carnivorans, would, have, resembled, small, weasel, or, genet, like, mammals, occupying, a, nocturnal, shift, on, the, forest, floor, or, in, the, trees, as, other, groups, of, mammals, like, the, mesonychians, and, later, the, creodonts, were, occupying, the, megafaunal, faunivorous, niche, however, following, the, extinction, of, mesonychians, and, the, oxyaenid, creodonts, at, the, end, of, the, eocene, carnivorans, quickly, moved, into, this, niche, with, forms, like, the, nimravids, being, the, dominant, large, bodied, ambush, predators, during, the, oligocene, alongside, the, hyaenodont, creodonts, which, similarly, produced, larger, more, open, country, forms, at, the, start, of, the, oligocene, by, the, time, miocene, epoch, appeared, most, if, not, all, of, the, major, lineages, and, families, of, carnivorans, had, diversified, and, become, the, most, dominant, group, of, large, terrestrial, predators, in, eurasia, and, north, america, with, various, lineages, being, successful, in, megafaunal, faunivorous, niches, at, different, intervals, during, the, miocene, and, later, epochs, the, order, carnivora, belongs, to, a, group, of, mammals, known, as, laurasiatheria, which, also, includes, other, groups, such, as, bats, and, ungulates, within, this, group, the, carnivorans, are, placed, in, the, clade, ferae, ferae, includes, the, closest, extant, relative, of, carnivorans, the, pangolins, as, well, as, several, extinct, groups, of, mostly, paleogene, carnivorous, placentals, such, as, the, creodonts, the, arctocyonians, and, mesonychians, the, creodonts, were, originally, thought, of, as, the, sister, taxon, to, the, carnivorans, perhaps, even, ancestral, to, based, on, the, presence, of, the, carnassial, teeth, but, the, nature, of, the, carnassial, teeth, is, different, between, the, two, groups, in, carnivorans, the, carnassials, are, positioned, near, the, front, of, the, molar, row, while, in, the, creodonts, they, are, positioned, near, the, back, of, the, molar, row, and, this, suggests, a, separate, evolutionary, history, and, an, order, level, distinction, in, addition, recent, phylogenetic, analysis, suggests, that, creodonts, are, more, closely, related, to, pangolins, while, mesonychians, might, be, the, sister, group, to, carnivorans, and, their, stem, relatives, the, closest, stem, carnivorans, are, the, miacoids, the, miacoids, include, the, families, viverravidae, and, miacidae, and, together, the, carnivora, and, miacoidea, form, the, stem, clade, carnivoramorpha, the, miacoids, were, small, genet, like, carnivoramorphs, that, occupy, a, variety, of, niches, such, as, terrestrial, and, arboreal, habitats, recent, studies, have, shown, a, supporting, amount, of, evidence, that, miacoidea, is, an, evolutionary, grade, of, carnivoramorphs, that, while, viverravids, are, monophyletic, basal, group, the, miacids, are, paraphyletic, in, respect, to, carnivora, as, shown, in, the, phylogeny, below, carnivoramorpha, as, a, whole, first, appeared, in, the, paleocene, of, north, america, about, 60, million, years, ago, crown, carnivorans, first, appeared, around, 42, million, years, ago, in, the, middle, eocene, their, molecular, phylogeny, shows, the, extant, carnivora, are, a, monophyletic, group, the, crown, group, of, the, carnivoramorpha, from, there, carnivorans, have, split, into, two, clades, based, on, the, composition, of, the, bony, structures, that, surround, the, middle, ear, of, the, skull, the, cat, like, feliforms, and, the, dog, like, caniforms, in, feliforms, the, auditory, bullae, are, double, chambered, composed, of, two, bones, joined, by, a, septum, caniforms, have, single, chambered, or, partially, divided, auditory, bullae, composed, of, a, single, bone, initially, the, early, representatives, of, carnivorans, were, small, as, the, creodonts, specifically, the, oxyaenids, and, mesonychians, dominated, the, apex, predator, niches, during, the, eocene, but, in, the, oligocene, carnivorans, became, a, dominant, group, of, apex, predators, with, the, nimravids, and, by, the, miocene, most, of, the, extant, carnivoran, families, have, diversified, and, become, the, primary, terrestrial, predators, in, the, northern, hemisphere, in, 1758, the, swedish, botanist, carl, linnaeus, placed, all, carnivorans, known, at, the, time, into, the, group, ferae, not, to, be, confused, with, the, modern, concept, of, ferae, which, also, includes, pangolins, in, the, tenth, edition, of, his, book, systema, naturae, he, recognized, six, genera, canis, canids, and, hyaenids, phoca, pinnipeds, felis, felids, viverra, viverrids, herpestids, and, mephitids, mustela, non, badger, mustelids, ursus, ursids, large, species, of, mustelids, and, procyonids, it, was, not, until, 1821, that, the, english, writer, and, traveler, thomas, edward, bowdich, gave, the, group, its, modern, and, accepted, name, initially, the, modern, concept, of, carnivora, was, divided, into, two, suborders, the, terrestrial, fissipedia, and, the, marine, pinnipedia, below, is, the, classification, of, how, the, extant, families, were, related, to, each, other, after, american, paleontologist, george, gaylord, simpson, in, 1945, since, then, however, the, methods, in, which, mammalogists, use, to, assess, the, phylogenetic, relationships, among, the, carnivoran, families, has, been, improved, with, using, more, complicated, and, intensive, incorporation, of, genetics, morphology, and, the, fossil, record, research, into, carnivora, phylogeny, since, 1945, has, found, fisspedia, to, be, paraphyletic, in, respect, to, pinnipedia, with, pinnipeds, being, either, more, closely, related, to, bears, or, to, weasels, the, small, carnivoran, families, viverridae, procyonidae, and, mustelidae, have, been, found, to, be, polyphyletic, below, is, a, table, chart, of, the, extant, carnivoran, families, and, number, of, extant, species, recognized, by, various, authors, of, the, first, 2009, and, fourth, 2014, volumes, of, the, handbook, of, the, mammals, of, the, world, the, canine, teeth, are, usually, large, conical, thick, and, stress, resistant, all, of, the, terrestrial, species, of, carnivorans, have, three, incisors, on, each, side, of, each, jaw, the, exception, is, the, sea, otter, enhydra, lutris, which, only, has, two, lower, incisor, teeth, the, third, molar, has, been, lost, the, carnassial, pair, is, made, up, of, the, fourth, upper, premolar, and, the, first, lower, molar, teeth, like, most, mammals, the, dentition, is, heterodont, though, in, some, species, such, as, the, aardwolf, proteles, cristata, the, teeth, have, been, greatly, reduced, and, the, cheek, teeth, are, specialised, for, eating, insects, in, pinnipeds, the, teeth, are, homodont, as, they, have, evolved, to, grasp, or, catch, fish, and, the, cheek, teeth, are, often, lost, in, bears, and, raccoons, the, carnassial, pair, is, secondarily, reduced, the, skulls, are, heavily, built, with, a, strong, zygomatic, arch, often, a, sagittal, crest, is, present, sometimes, more, evident, in, sexually, dimorphic, species, such, as, sea, lions, and, fur, seals, though, it, has, also, been, greatly, reduced, in, some, small, carnivorans, the, braincase, is, enlarged, with, the, frontoparietal, bone, at, the, front, in, most, species, the, eyes, are, at, the, front, of, the, face, in, caniforms, the, rostrum, is, usually, long, with, many, teeth, while, in, feliforms, it, is, shorter, with, fewer, teeth, the, carnassial, teeth, of, feliforms, are, generally, more, sectional, than, those, of, caniforms, the, turbinates, are, large, and, complex, in, comparison, to, other, mammals, providing, a, large, surface, area, for, olfactory, receptors, aside, from, an, accumulation, of, characteristics, in, the, dental, and, cranial, features, not, much, of, their, overall, anatomy, unites, carnivorans, as, a, group, all, species, of, carnivorans, are, quadrupedal, and, most, have, five, digits, on, the, front, feet, and, four, digits, on, the, back, feet, in, terrestrial, carnivorans, the, feet, have, soft, pads, the, feet, can, either, be, digitigrade, as, seen, in, cats, hyenas, and, dogs, or, plantigrade, as, seen, in, bears, skunks, raccoons, weasels, civets, and, mongooses, in, pinnipeds, the, limbs, have, been, modified, into, flippers, unlike, cetaceans, and, sirenians, which, have, fully, functional, tails, to, help, them, swim, pinnipeds, use, their, limbs, underwater, to, swim, earless, seals, use, their, back, flippers, sea, lions, and, fur, seals, use, their, front, flippers, and, the, walrus, use, all, of, their, limbs, as, a, result, pinnipeds, have, significantly, shorter, tails, than, other, carnivorans, aside, from, the, pinnipeds, dogs, bears, hyenas, and, cats, all, have, distinct, and, recognizable, appearances, dogs, are, usually, cursorial, mammals, and, are, gracile, in, appearance, often, relying, on, their, teeth, to, hold, prey, bears, are, much, larger, and, rely, on, their, physical, strength, to, forage, for, food, compared, to, dogs, and, bears, cats, have, longer, and, stronger, forelimbs, armed, with, retractable, claws, to, hold, on, to, prey, hyenas, are, dog, like, feliforms, that, have, sloping, backs, due, to, their, front, legs, being, longer, than, their, hind, legs, the, raccoon, family, and, red, panda, are, small, bear, like, carnivorans, with, long, tails, the, other, small, carnivoran, families, nandiniidae, prionodontidae, viverridae, herpestidae, eupleridae, mephitidae, and, mustelidae, have, through, convergent, evolution, maintained, the, small, ancestral, appearance, of, the, miacoids, though, there, is, some, variation, seen, such, as, the, robust, and, stout, physicality, of, badgers, and, the, wolverine, gulo, gulo, most, carnivoran, species, have, a, well, defined, breeding, season, male, carnivorans, usually, have, bacula, which, are, absent, in, hyenas, and, binturongs, the, length, and, density, of, the, fur, vary, depending, on, the, environment, that, the, species, inhabits, in, warm, climate, species, the, fur, is, often, short, in, length, and, lighter, in, cold, climate, species, the, fur, is, either, dense, or, long, often, with, an, oily, substance, that, helps, to, retain, heat, the, pelage, coloration, differs, between, species, often, including, black, white, orange, yellow, red, and, many, shades, of, grey, and, brown, some, are, striped, spotted, blotched, banded, or, otherwise, boldly, patterned, there, seems, to, be, a, correlation, between, habitat, and, color, pattern, for, example, spotted, or, banded, species, tend, to, be, found, in, heavily, forested, environments, some, species, like, the, grey, wolf, are, polymorphic, with, different, individual, having, different, coat, colors, the, arctic, fox, vulpes, lagopus, and, the, stoat, mustela, erminea, have, fur, that, changes, from, white, and, dense, in, the, winter, to, brown, and, sparse, in, the, summer, in, pinnipeds, and, polar, bears, a, thick, insulating, layer, of, blubber, helps, maintain, their, body, temperature, carnivorans, are, arguably, the, group, of, mammals, of, most, interest, to, humans, the, dog, is, noteworthy, for, not, only, being, the, first, species, of, carnivoran, to, be, domesticated, but, also, the, first, species, of, any, taxon, in, the, last, 10, 000, to, 12, 000, years, humans, have, selectively, bred, dogs, for, a, variety, of, different, tasks, and, today, there, are, well, over, 400, breeds, the, cat, is, another, domesticated, carnivoran, and, it, is, today, considered, one, of, the, most, successful, species, on, the, planet, due, to, their, close, proximity, to, humans, and, the, popularity, of, cats, as, pets, many, other, species, are, popular, and, they, are, often, charismatic, megafauna, many, civilizations, have, incorporated, a, species, of, carnivoran, into, their, culture, a, prominent, example, is, the, lion, viewed, as, a, symbol, of, power, and, royalty, in, many, societies, yet, many, species, such, as, wolves, and, the, big, cats, have, been, broadly, hunted, resulting, in, extirpation, in, some, areas, habitat, loss, and, human, encroachment, as, well, as, climate, change, have, been, the, primary, cause, of, many, species, going, into, decline, four, species, of, carnivorans, have, gone, extinct, since, the, 1600s, falkland, island, wolf, dusicyon, australis, in, 1876, the, sea, mink, neogale, macrodon, in, 1894, the, japanese, sea, lion, zalophus, japonicus, in, 1951, and, the, caribbean, monk, seal, neomonachus, tropicalis, in, 1952, some, species, such, as, the, red, fox, vulpes, vulpes, and, stoat, mustela, erminea, have, been, introduced, to, australasia, and, have, caused, many, native, species, to, become, endangered, or, even, extinct
