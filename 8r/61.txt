white, blood, cells, scientific, name, leukocytes, also, called, immune, cells, or, immunocytes, are, cells, of, the, immune, system, that, are, involved, in, protecting, the, body, against, both, infectious, disease, and, foreign, invaders, white, blood, cells, include, three, main, subtypes, granulocytes, lymphocytes, and, monocytes, all, white, blood, cells, are, produced, and, derived, from, multipotent, cells, in, the, bone, marrow, known, as, hematopoietic, stem, cells, leukocytes, are, found, throughout, the, body, including, the, blood, and, lymphatic, system, all, white, blood, cells, have, nuclei, which, distinguishes, them, from, the, other, blood, cells, the, anucleated, red, blood, cells, rbcs, and, platelets, the, different, white, blood, cells, are, usually, classified, by, cell, lineage, myeloid, cells, or, lymphoid, cells, white, blood, cells, are, part, of, the, body, s, immune, system, they, help, the, body, fight, infection, and, other, diseases, types, of, white, blood, cells, are, granulocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and, basophils, and, agranulocytes, monocytes, and, lymphocytes, t, cells, and, b, cells, myeloid, cells, myelocytes, include, neutrophils, eosinophils, mast, cells, basophils, and, monocytes, monocytes, are, further, subdivided, into, dendritic, cells, and, macrophages, monocytes, macrophages, and, neutrophils, are, phagocytic, lymphoid, cells, lymphocytes, include, t, cells, subdivided, into, helper, t, cells, memory, t, cells, cytotoxic, t, cells, b, cells, subdivided, into, plasma, cells, and, memory, b, cells, and, natural, killer, cells, historically, white, blood, cells, were, classified, by, their, physical, characteristics, granulocytes, and, agranulocytes, but, this, classification, system, is, less, frequently, used, now, produced, in, the, bone, marrow, white, blood, cells, defend, the, body, against, infections, and, disease, an, excess, of, white, blood, cells, is, usually, due, to, infection, or, inflammation, less, commonly, a, high, white, blood, cell, count, could, indicate, certain, blood, cancers, or, bone, marrow, disorders, the, number, of, leukocytes, in, the, blood, is, often, an, indicator, of, disease, and, thus, the, white, blood, cell, count, is, an, important, subset, of, the, complete, blood, count, the, normal, white, cell, count, is, usually, between, 4, 10, 9, l, and, 1, 1, 10, 10, l, in, the, us, this, is, usually, expressed, as, 4, 000, to, 11, 000, white, blood, cells, per, microliter, of, blood, white, blood, cells, make, up, approximately, 1, of, the, total, blood, volume, in, a, healthy, adult, making, them, substantially, less, numerous, than, the, red, blood, cells, at, 40, to, 45, however, this, 1, of, the, blood, makes, a, large, difference, to, health, because, immunity, depends, on, it, an, increase, in, the, number, of, leukocytes, over, the, upper, limits, is, called, leukocytosis, it, is, normal, when, it, is, part, of, healthy, immune, responses, which, happen, frequently, it, is, occasionally, abnormal, when, it, is, neoplastic, or, autoimmune, in, origin, a, decrease, below, the, lower, limit, is, called, leukopenia, this, indicates, a, weakened, immune, system, the, name, white, blood, cell, derives, from, the, physical, appearance, of, a, blood, sample, after, centrifugation, white, cells, are, found, in, the, buffy, coat, a, thin, typically, white, layer, of, nucleated, cells, between, the, sedimented, red, blood, cells, and, the, blood, plasma, the, scientific, term, leukocyte, directly, reflects, its, description, it, is, derived, from, the, greek, roots, leuk, meaning, white, and, cyt, meaning, cell, the, buffy, coat, may, sometimes, be, green, if, there, are, large, amounts, of, neutrophils, in, the, sample, due, to, the, heme, containing, enzyme, myeloperoxidase, that, they, produce, all, white, blood, cells, are, nucleated, which, distinguishes, them, from, the, anucleated, red, blood, cells, and, platelets, types, of, leukocytes, can, be, classified, in, standard, ways, two, pairs, of, broadest, categories, classify, them, either, by, structure, granulocytes, or, agranulocytes, or, by, cell, lineage, myeloid, cells, or, lymphoid, cells, these, broadest, categories, can, be, further, divided, into, the, five, main, types, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and, monocytes, a, good, way, to, remember, the, relative, proportions, of, wbcs, is, never, let, monkeys, eat, bananas, these, types, are, distinguished, by, their, physical, and, functional, characteristics, monocytes, and, neutrophils, are, phagocytic, further, subtypes, can, be, classified, granulocytes, are, distinguished, from, agranulocytes, by, their, nucleus, shape, lobed, versus, round, that, is, polymorphonuclear, versus, mononuclear, and, by, their, cytoplasm, granules, present, or, absent, or, more, precisely, visible, on, light, microscopy, or, not, thus, visible, the, other, dichotomy, is, by, lineage, myeloid, cells, neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and, basophils, are, distinguished, from, lymphoid, cells, lymphocytes, by, hematopoietic, lineage, cellular, differentiation, lineage, lymphocytes, can, be, further, classified, as, t, cells, b, cells, and, natural, killer, cells, neutrophils, are, the, most, abundant, white, blood, cell, constituting, 60, 70, of, the, circulating, leukocytes, they, defend, against, bacterial, or, fungal, infection, they, are, usually, first, responders, to, microbial, infection, their, activity, and, death, in, large, numbers, form, pus, they, are, commonly, referred, to, as, polymorphonuclear, pmn, leukocytes, although, in, the, technical, sense, pmn, refers, to, all, granulocytes, they, have, a, multi, lobed, nucleus, which, consists, of, three, to, five, lobes, connected, by, slender, strands, this, gives, the, neutrophils, the, appearance, of, having, multiple, nuclei, hence, the, name, polymorphonuclear, leukocyte, the, cytoplasm, may, look, transparent, because, of, fine, granules, that, are, pale, lilac, when, stained, neutrophils, are, active, in, phagocytosing, bacteria, and, are, present, in, large, amount, in, the, pus, of, wounds, these, cells, are, not, able, to, renew, their, lysosomes, used, in, digesting, microbes, and, die, after, having, phagocytosed, a, few, pathogens, neutrophils, are, the, most, common, cell, type, seen, in, the, early, stages, of, acute, inflammation, the, average, lifespan, of, inactivated, human, neutrophils, in, the, circulation, has, been, reported, by, different, approaches, to, be, between, 5, and, 135, hours, eosinophils, compose, about, 2, 4, of, white, blood, cells, in, circulating, blood, this, count, fluctuates, throughout, the, day, seasonally, and, during, menstruation, it, rises, in, response, to, allergies, parasitic, infections, collagen, diseases, and, disease, of, the, spleen, and, central, nervous, system, they, are, rare, in, the, blood, but, numerous, in, the, mucous, membranes, of, the, respiratory, digestive, and, lower, urinary, tracts, they, primarily, deal, with, parasitic, infections, eosinophils, are, also, the, predominant, inflammatory, cells, in, allergic, reactions, the, most, important, causes, of, eosinophilia, include, allergies, such, as, asthma, hay, fever, and, hives, and, parasitic, infections, they, secrete, chemicals, that, destroy, large, parasites, such, as, hookworms, and, tapeworms, that, are, too, big, for, any, one, white, blood, cell, to, phagocytize, in, general, their, nuclei, are, bi, lobed, the, lobes, are, connected, by, a, thin, strand, the, cytoplasm, is, full, of, granules, that, assume, a, characteristic, pink, orange, color, with, eosin, staining, basophils, are, chiefly, responsible, for, allergic, and, antigen, response, by, releasing, the, chemical, histamine, causing, the, dilation, of, blood, vessels, because, they, are, the, rarest, of, the, white, blood, cells, less, than, 0, 5, of, the, total, count, and, share, physicochemical, properties, with, other, blood, cells, they, are, difficult, to, study, they, can, be, recognized, by, several, coarse, dark, violet, granules, giving, them, a, blue, hue, the, nucleus, is, bi, or, tri, lobed, but, it, is, hard, to, see, because, of, the, number, of, coarse, granules, that, hide, it, they, secrete, two, chemicals, that, aid, in, the, body, s, defenses, histamine, and, heparin, histamine, is, responsible, for, widening, blood, vessels, and, increasing, the, flow, of, blood, to, injured, tissue, it, also, makes, blood, vessels, more, permeable, so, neutrophils, and, clotting, proteins, can, get, into, connective, tissue, more, easily, heparin, is, an, anticoagulant, that, inhibits, blood, clotting, and, promotes, the, movement, of, white, blood, cells, into, an, area, basophils, can, also, release, chemical, signals, that, attract, eosinophils, and, neutrophils, to, an, infection, site, lymphocytes, are, much, more, common, in, the, lymphatic, system, than, in, blood, lymphocytes, are, distinguished, by, having, a, deeply, staining, nucleus, that, may, be, eccentric, in, location, and, a, relatively, small, amount, of, cytoplasm, lymphocytes, include, monocytes, the, largest, type, of, white, blood, cell, share, the, vacuum, cleaner, phagocytosis, function, of, neutrophils, but, are, much, longer, lived, as, they, have, an, extra, role, they, present, pieces, of, pathogens, to, t, cells, so, that, the, pathogens, may, be, recognized, again, and, killed, this, causes, an, antibody, response, to, be, mounted, monocytes, eventually, leave, the, bloodstream, and, become, tissue, macrophages, which, remove, dead, cell, debris, as, well, as, attack, microorganisms, neither, dead, cell, debris, nor, attacking, microorganisms, can, be, dealt, with, effectively, by, the, neutrophils, unlike, neutrophils, monocytes, are, able, to, replace, their, lysosomal, contents, and, are, thought, to, have, a, much, longer, active, life, they, have, the, kidney, shaped, nucleus, and, are, typically, not, granulated, they, also, possess, abundant, cytoplasm, some, leucocytes, migrate, into, the, tissues, of, the, body, to, take, up, a, permanent, residence, at, that, location, rather, than, remaining, in, the, blood, often, these, cells, have, specific, names, depending, upon, which, tissue, they, settle, in, such, as, fixed, macrophages, in, the, liver, which, become, known, as, kupffer, cells, these, cells, still, serve, a, role, in, the, immune, system, the, two, commonly, used, categories, of, white, blood, cell, disorders, divide, them, quantitatively, into, those, causing, excessive, numbers, proliferative, disorders, and, those, causing, insufficient, numbers, leukopenias, leukocytosis, is, usually, healthy, e, g, fighting, an, infection, but, it, also, may, be, dysfunctionally, proliferative, proliferative, disorders, of, white, blood, cells, can, be, classed, as, myeloproliferative, and, lymphoproliferative, some, are, autoimmune, but, many, are, neoplastic, another, way, to, categorize, disorders, of, white, blood, cells, is, qualitatively, there, are, various, disorders, in, which, the, number, of, white, blood, cells, is, normal, but, the, cells, do, not, function, normally, neoplasia, of, white, blood, cells, can, be, benign, but, is, often, malignant, of, the, various, tumors, of, the, blood, and, lymph, cancers, of, white, blood, cells, can, be, broadly, classified, as, leukemias, and, lymphomas, although, those, categories, overlap, and, are, often, grouped, together, a, range, of, disorders, can, cause, decreases, in, white, blood, cells, this, type, of, white, blood, cell, decreased, is, usually, the, neutrophil, in, this, case, the, decrease, may, be, called, neutropenia, or, granulocytopenia, less, commonly, a, decrease, in, lymphocytes, called, lymphocytopenia, or, lymphopenia, may, be, seen, neutropenia, can, be, acquired, or, intrinsic, a, decrease, in, levels, of, neutrophils, on, lab, tests, is, due, to, either, decreased, production, of, neutrophils, or, increased, removal, from, the, blood, the, following, list, of, causes, is, not, complete, symptoms, of, neutropenia, are, associated, with, the, underlying, cause, of, the, decrease, in, neutrophils, for, example, the, most, common, cause, of, acquired, neutropenia, is, drug, induced, so, an, individual, may, have, symptoms, of, medication, overdose, or, toxicity, treatment, is, also, aimed, at, the, underlying, cause, of, the, neutropenia, one, severe, consequence, of, neutropenia, is, that, it, can, increase, the, risk, of, infection, defined, as, total, lymphocyte, count, below, 1, 0x10, 9, l, the, cells, most, commonly, affected, are, cd4, t, cells, like, neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, may, be, acquired, or, intrinsic, and, there, are, many, causes, this, is, not, a, complete, list, like, neutropenia, symptoms, and, treatment, of, lymphocytopenia, are, directed, at, the, underlying, cause, of, the, change, in, cell, counts, an, increase, in, the, number, of, white, blood, cells, in, circulation, is, called, leukocytosis, this, increase, is, most, commonly, caused, by, inflammation, there, are, four, major, causes, increase, of, production, in, bone, marrow, increased, release, from, storage, in, bone, marrow, decreased, attachment, to, veins, and, arteries, decreased, uptake, by, tissues, leukocytosis, may, affect, one, or, more, cell, lines, and, can, be, neutrophilic, eosinophilic, basophilic, monocytosis, or, lymphocytosis, neutrophilia, is, an, increase, in, the, absolute, neutrophil, count, in, the, peripheral, circulation, normal, blood, values, vary, by, age, neutrophilia, can, be, caused, by, a, direct, problem, with, blood, cells, primary, disease, it, can, also, occur, as, a, consequence, of, an, underlying, disease, secondary, most, cases, of, neutrophilia, are, secondary, to, inflammation, primary, causes, secondary, causes, a, normal, eosinophil, count, is, considered, to, be, less, than, 0, 65, 10, 9, l, eosinophil, counts, are, higher, in, newborns, and, vary, with, age, time, lower, in, the, morning, and, higher, at, night, exercise, environment, and, exposure, to, allergens, eosinophilia, is, never, a, normal, lab, finding, efforts, should, always, be, made, to, discover, the, underlying, cause, though, the, cause, may, not, always, be, found, the, complete, blood, cell, count, is, a, blood, panel, that, includes, the, overall, white, blood, cell, count, and, differential, count, a, count, of, each, type, of, white, blood, cell, reference, ranges, for, blood, tests, specify, the, typical, counts, in, healthy, people, the, normal, total, leucocyte, count, in, an, adult, is, 4000, to, 11, 000, per, mm, 3, of, blood, differential, leucocyte, count, number, of, different, types, of, leucocytes, per, cubic, mm, of, blood, below, are, reference, ranges, for, various, types, leucocytes
