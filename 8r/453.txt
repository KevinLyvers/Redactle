lampreys, l, m, p, r, e, z, sometimes, inaccurately, called, lamprey, eels, are, a, group, of, jawless, fish, comprising, the, order, petromyzontiformes, p, t, r, o, m, z, n, t, f, r, m, i, z, the, adult, lamprey, is, characterized, by, a, toothed, funnel, like, sucking, mouth, the, common, name, lamprey, is, probably, derived, from, latin, lampetra, which, may, mean, stone, licker, lambere, to, lick, petra, stone, though, the, etymology, is, uncertain, lamprey, is, sometimes, seen, for, the, plural, form, there, are, about, 38, known, extant, species, of, lampreys, and, around, seven, known, extinct, species, they, are, classified, in, three, families, two, small, families, in, the, southern, hemisphere, geotriidae, mordaciidae, and, one, large, family, in, the, northern, hemisphere, petromyzontidae, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, lampreys, are, more, closely, related, to, hagfish, the, only, other, living, group, of, jawless, fish, than, they, are, to, jawed, vertebrates, forming, the, superclass, cyclostomi, the, oldest, fossils, of, stem, group, lampreys, are, from, the, latest, devonian, period, around, 360, million, years, ago, with, modern, looking, forms, only, appearing, during, the, jurassic, period, around, 163, million, years, ago, with, the, modern, families, likely, splitting, from, each, sometime, between, the, middle, jurassic, and, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, modern, lampreys, spend, the, majority, of, their, life, in, the, juvenile, ammocoete, stage, where, they, burrow, into, the, sediment, and, filter, feed, adult, carnivorous, lampreys, are, the, most, well, known, species, and, feed, by, boring, into, the, flesh, of, other, fish, or, in, rare, cases, marine, mammals, to, consume, flesh, and, or, blood, but, only, 18, species, of, lampreys, engage, in, this, predatory, lifestyle, with, caspiomyzon, suggested, to, feed, on, carrion, rather, than, live, prey, of, the, 18, carnivorous, species, nine, migrate, from, saltwater, to, freshwater, to, breed, some, of, them, also, have, freshwater, populations, and, nine, live, exclusively, in, freshwater, all, non, carnivorous, forms, are, freshwater, species, adults, of, the, non, carnivorous, species, do, not, feed, they, live, on, reserves, acquired, as, ammocoetes, lampreys, live, mostly, in, coastal, and, fresh, waters, and, are, found, in, most, temperate, regions, some, species, e, g, geotria, australis, petromyzon, marinus, and, entosphenus, tridentatus, travel, significant, distances, in, the, open, ocean, as, evidenced, by, their, lack, of, reproductive, isolation, between, populations, other, species, are, found, in, land, locked, lakes, their, larvae, ammocoetes, have, a, low, tolerance, for, high, water, temperatures, which, may, explain, why, they, are, not, distributed, in, the, tropics, lamprey, distribution, may, be, adversely, affected, by, river, habitat, loss, overfishing, and, pollution, in, britain, at, the, time, of, the, 11th, century, norman, conquest, of, england, lampreys, were, found, as, far, upstream, in, the, river, thames, as, petersham, the, reduction, of, pollution, in, the, thames, and, river, wear, has, led, to, recent, sightings, in, london, and, chester, le, street, distribution, of, lampreys, may, also, be, adversely, affected, by, dams, and, other, construction, projects, due, to, disruption, of, migration, routes, and, obstruction, of, access, to, spawning, grounds, conversely, the, construction, of, artificial, channels, has, exposed, new, habitats, for, colonisation, notably, in, north, america, where, sea, lampreys, have, become, a, significant, introduced, pest, in, the, great, lakes, active, control, programs, to, control, lampreys, are, undergoing, modifications, due, to, concerns, of, drinking, water, quality, in, some, areas, adults, superficially, resemble, eels, in, that, they, have, scaleless, elongated, bodies, with, the, largest, species, the, sea, lamprey, having, a, maximum, body, length, of, around, 1, 2, metres, 3, 9, ft, lacking, paired, fins, adult, lampreys, have, one, nostril, atop, the, head, and, seven, gill, pores, on, each, side, of, the, head, the, brain, of, the, lamprey, is, divided, into, the, telencephalon, diencephalon, midbrain, cerebellum, and, medulla, lampreys, have, been, described, as, the, only, living, vertebrates, to, have, four, eyes, having, a, single, pair, of, regular, eyes, as, well, as, two, parietal, eyes, a, pineal, and, parapineal, one, the, exception, is, members, of, mordacia, the, eyes, of, juvenile, lampreys, are, poorly, developed, eyespot, like, structures, that, are, covered, in, non, transparent, skin, while, the, eyes, of, adult, lampreys, are, well, developed, accommodation, is, done, by, flattening, the, cornea, which, pushes, the, lens, towards, the, retina, the, eye, of, family, mordaciidae, possess, just, a, single, type, of, photoreceptor, rod, like, the, family, petromyzontidae, possess, two, photoreceptor, types, a, cone, like, and, a, rod, like, and, the, family, geotriidae, possesses, five, types, of, photoreceptors, the, buccal, cavity, anterior, to, the, gonads, is, responsible, for, attaching, the, animal, through, suction, to, either, a, stone, or, its, prey, this, then, allows, the, tongue, to, make, contact, with, the, stone, to, rasp, algae, or, tear, at, the, flesh, of, their, prey, to, yield, blood, the, last, common, ancestor, of, lampreys, appears, to, have, been, specialized, to, feed, on, the, blood, and, body, fluids, of, other, fish, after, metamorphosis, they, attach, their, mouthparts, to, the, target, animal, s, body, then, use, three, horny, plates, laminae, on, the, tip, of, their, piston, like, tongue, one, transversely, and, two, longitudinally, placed, to, scrape, through, surface, tissues, until, they, reach, body, fluids, the, teeth, on, their, oral, disc, are, primarily, used, to, help, the, animal, attach, itself, to, its, prey, made, of, keratin, and, other, proteins, lamprey, teeth, have, a, hollow, core, to, give, room, for, replacement, teeth, growing, under, the, old, ones, some, of, the, original, blood, feeding, forms, have, evolved, into, species, that, feed, on, both, blood, and, flesh, and, some, who, have, become, specialized, to, eat, flesh, and, may, even, invade, the, internal, organs, of, the, host, tissue, feeders, can, also, involve, the, teeth, on, the, oral, disc, in, the, excision, of, tissue, as, a, result, the, flesh, feeders, have, smaller, buccal, glands, as, they, do, not, require, the, production, of, anticoagulant, continuously, and, mechanisms, for, preventing, solid, material, entering, the, branchial, pouches, which, could, otherwise, potentially, clog, the, gills, a, study, of, the, stomach, content, of, some, lampreys, has, shown, the, remains, of, intestines, fins, and, vertebrae, from, their, prey, close, to, the, jaws, of, juvenile, lampreys, a, muscular, flap, like, structure, called, the, velum, is, present, which, serves, to, generate, a, water, current, towards, the, mouth, opening, which, enables, feeding, and, respiration, the, unique, morphological, characteristics, of, lampreys, such, as, their, cartilaginous, skeleton, suggest, they, are, the, sister, taxon, see, cladistics, of, all, living, jawed, vertebrates, gnathostomes, they, are, usually, considered, the, most, basal, group, of, the, vertebrata, instead, of, true, vertebrae, they, have, a, series, of, cartilaginous, structures, called, arcualia, arranged, above, the, notochord, hagfish, which, resemble, lampreys, have, traditionally, been, considered, the, sister, taxon, of, the, true, vertebrates, lampreys, and, gnathostomes, but, dna, evidence, suggests, that, they, are, in, fact, the, sister, taxon, of, lampreys, the, heart, of, the, lamprey, is, anterior, to, the, intestines, it, contains, the, sinus, one, atrium, and, one, ventricle, protected, by, the, pericardial, cartilages, the, pineal, gland, a, photosensitive, organ, regulating, melatonin, production, by, capturing, light, signals, through, the, photoreceptor, cell, converting, them, into, intercellular, signals, of, the, lamprey, is, located, in, the, midline, of, its, body, for, lamprey, the, pineal, eye, is, accompanied, by, the, parapineal, organ, one, of, the, key, physical, components, to, the, lamprey, are, the, intestines, which, are, located, ventral, to, the, notochord, intestines, aid, in, osmoregulation, by, intaking, water, from, its, environment, and, desalinating, the, water, they, intake, to, an, iso, osmotic, state, with, respect, to, blood, and, are, also, responsible, for, digestion, studies, have, shown, that, lampreys, are, among, the, most, energy, efficient, swimmers, their, swimming, movements, generate, low, pressure, zones, around, the, body, which, pull, rather, than, push, their, bodies, through, the, water, different, species, of, lamprey, have, many, shared, physical, characteristics, the, same, anatomical, structure, can, serve, different, functions, in, the, lamprey, depending, on, whether, or, not, it, is, carnivorous, the, mouth, and, suction, capabilities, of, the, lamprey, not, only, allow, it, to, cling, to, a, fish, as, a, parasite, but, provide, it, with, limited, climbing, ability, so, that, it, can, travel, upstream, and, up, ramps, or, rocks, to, breed, this, ability, has, been, studied, in, an, attempt, to, better, understand, how, lampreys, battle, the, current, and, move, forward, despite, only, being, able, to, hold, onto, the, rock, at, a, single, point, some, scientists, are, also, hoping, to, design, ramps, that, will, optimize, the, lamprey, s, climbing, ability, as, lampreys, are, valued, as, food, in, the, northwest, united, states, and, need, to, travel, upstream, to, reproduce, many, lampreys, exhibit, countershading, a, form, of, camouflage, similarly, to, many, other, aquatic, species, most, lampreys, have, a, dark, colored, back, which, enables, them, to, blend, in, with, the, ground, below, when, seen, from, above, by, a, predator, their, light, colored, undersides, allow, them, to, blend, in, with, the, bright, air, and, water, above, them, if, a, predator, sees, them, from, below, lamprey, coloration, can, also, vary, according, to, the, region, and, specific, environment, in, which, the, species, is, found, some, species, can, be, distinguished, by, their, unique, markings, for, example, geotria, australis, individuals, display, two, bluish, stripes, running, the, length, of, its, body, as, an, adult, these, markings, can, also, sometimes, be, used, to, determine, what, stage, of, the, life, cycle, the, lamprey, is, in, g, australis, individuals, lose, these, stripes, when, they, approach, the, reproductive, phase, and, begin, to, travel, upstream, another, example, is, petromyzon, marinus, which, shifts, to, more, of, an, orange, color, as, it, reaches, the, reproductive, stage, in, its, life, cycle, northern, lampreys, petromyzontidae, have, the, highest, number, of, chromosomes, 164, 174, among, vertebrates, due, to, certain, peculiarities, in, their, adaptive, immune, system, the, study, of, lampreys, provides, valuable, insight, into, the, evolution, of, vertebrate, adaptive, immunity, generated, from, a, somatic, recombination, of, leucine, rich, repeat, gene, segments, lamprey, leukocytes, express, surface, variable, lymphocyte, receptors, vlrs, this, convergently, evolved, characteristic, allows, them, to, have, lymphocytes, that, work, as, the, t, cells, and, b, cells, present, in, higher, vertebrates, immune, system, pouched, lamprey, geotria, australis, larvae, also, have, a, very, high, tolerance, for, free, iron, in, their, bodies, and, have, well, developed, biochemical, systems, for, detoxification, of, the, large, quantities, of, these, metal, ions, the, adults, spawn, in, nests, of, sand, gravel, and, pebbles, in, clear, streams, after, hatching, from, the, eggs, young, larvae, called, ammocoetes, will, drift, downstream, with, the, current, till, they, reach, soft, and, fine, sediment, in, silt, beds, where, they, will, burrow, in, silt, mud, and, detritus, taking, up, an, existence, as, filter, feeders, collecting, detritus, algae, and, microorganisms, the, eyes, of, the, larvae, are, underdeveloped, but, are, capable, of, discriminating, changes, in, illuminance, ammocoetes, can, grow, from, 3, 4, inches, 8, 10, centimetres, to, about, 8, inches, 20, cm, many, species, change, color, during, a, diurnal, cycle, becoming, dark, at, day, and, pale, at, night, the, skin, also, has, photoreceptors, light, sensitive, cells, most, of, them, concentrated, in, the, tail, which, helps, them, to, stay, buried, lampreys, may, spend, up, to, eight, years, as, ammocoetes, while, species, such, as, the, arctic, lamprey, may, only, spend, one, to, two, years, as, larvae, prior, to, undergoing, a, metamorphosis, which, generally, lasts, 3, 4, months, but, can, vary, between, species, while, metamorphosing, they, do, not, eat, the, rate, of, water, moving, across, the, ammocoetes, feeding, apparatus, is, the, lowest, recorded, in, any, suspension, feeding, animal, and, they, therefore, require, water, rich, in, nutrients, to, fulfill, their, nutritional, needs, while, the, majority, of, invertebrate, suspension, feeders, thrive, in, waters, containing, under, 1, mg, suspended, organic, solids, per, litre, 1, mg, l, ammocoetes, demand, minimum, 4, mg, l, with, concentrations, in, their, habitats, having, been, measured, up, to, 40, mg, l, during, metamorphosis, the, lamprey, loses, both, the, gallbladder, and, the, biliary, tract, and, the, endostyle, turns, into, a, thyroid, gland, some, species, including, those, that, are, not, carnivorous, and, do, not, feed, even, following, metamorphosis, live, in, freshwater, for, their, entire, lifecycle, spawning, and, dying, shortly, after, metamorphosing, in, contrast, many, species, are, anadromous, and, migrate, to, the, sea, beginning, to, prey, on, other, animals, while, still, swimming, downstream, after, their, metamorphosis, provides, them, with, eyes, teeth, and, a, sucking, mouth, those, that, are, anadromous, are, carnivorous, feeding, on, fishes, or, marine, mammals, anadromous, lampreys, spend, up, to, four, years, in, the, sea, before, migrating, back, to, freshwater, where, they, spawn, adults, create, nests, called, redds, by, moving, rocks, and, females, release, thousands, of, eggs, sometimes, up, to, 100, 000, the, male, intertwined, with, the, female, fertilizes, the, eggs, simultaneously, being, semelparous, both, adults, die, after, the, eggs, are, fertilized, research, on, sea, lampreys, has, revealed, that, sexually, mature, males, use, a, specialized, heat, producing, tissue, in, the, form, of, a, ridge, of, fat, cells, near, the, anterior, dorsal, fin, to, stimulate, females, after, having, attracted, a, female, with, pheromones, the, heat, detected, by, the, female, through, body, contact, will, encourage, spawning, taxonomists, place, lampreys, and, hagfish, in, the, subphylum, vertebrata, of, the, phylum, chordata, which, also, includes, the, invertebrate, subphyla, tunicata, sea, squirts, and, the, fish, like, cephalochordata, lancelets, or, amphioxus, recent, molecular, and, morphological, phylogenetic, studies, place, lampreys, and, hagfish, in, the, infraphylum, agnatha, or, agnathostomata, both, meaning, without, jaws, the, other, vertebrate, infraphylum, is, gnathostomata, jawed, mouths, and, includes, the, classes, chondrichthyes, sharks, osteichthyes, bony, fishes, amphibia, reptilia, aves, and, mammalia, some, researchers, have, classified, lampreys, as, the, sole, surviving, representatives, of, the, linnean, class, cephalaspidomorphi, cephalaspidomorpha, is, sometimes, given, as, a, subclass, of, the, cephalaspidomorphi, fossil, evidence, now, suggests, lampreys, and, cephalaspids, acquired, their, shared, characters, by, convergent, evolution, as, such, many, newer, works, such, as, the, fourth, edition, of, fishes, of, the, world, classify, lampreys, in, a, separate, group, called, hyperoartia, or, petromyzontida, the, debate, about, their, systematics, notwithstanding, lampreys, constitute, a, single, order, petromyzontiformes, sometimes, still, seen, is, the, alternative, spelling, petromyzoniformes, based, on, the, argument, that, the, type, genus, is, petromyzon, and, not, petromyzonta, or, similar, throughout, most, of, the, 20th, century, both, names, were, used, indiscriminately, even, by, the, same, author, in, subsequent, publications, in, the, mid, 1970s, the, iczn, was, called, upon, to, fix, one, name, or, the, other, and, after, much, debate, had, to, resolve, the, issue, by, voting, thus, in, 1980, the, spelling, with, a, t, won, out, and, in, 1981, it, became, official, that, all, higher, level, taxa, based, on, petromyzon, have, to, start, with, petromyzont, phylogeny, based, on, brownstein, near, 2023, geotria, gray, 1851, pouched, lampreys, mordacia, gray, 1853, southern, topeyed, lampreys, caspiomyzon, berg, 1906, petromyzon, linnaeus, 1758, sea, lamprey, ichthyomyzon, girard, 1858, entosphenus, gill, 1863, tetrapleurodon, creaser, hubbs, 1922, mexican, lampreys, western, american, lampetra, lethenteron, creaser, hubbs, 1922, eudontomyzon, regan, 1911, lampetra, sensu, stricto, bonnaterre, 1788, eastern, american, and, european, lampetra, recent, studies, differ, regarding, the, timing, of, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, living, lampreys, with, some, suggesting, a, middle, jurassic, date, around, 175, million, years, ago, while, other, studies, have, suggested, a, younger, split, dating, to, the, late, cretaceous, the, older, date, study, posited, that, the, northern, and, southern, hemisphere, lampreys, diverged, as, part, of, the, breakup, of, pangea, while, the, late, cretaceous, study, suggested, that, modern, lampreys, emerged, in, the, southern, hemisphere, it, is, thought, that, most, modern, lamprey, diversity, emerged, during, the, cenozoic, particularly, within, the, last, 10, 20, million, years, the, oldest, fossil, lamprey, priscomyzon, is, known, from, the, latest, devonian, of, south, africa, around, 360, million, years, ago, with, other, stem, group, lampreys, like, pipiscius, mayomyzon, and, hardistiella, known, from, the, carboniferous, of, north, america, these, paleozoic, stem, lampreys, are, small, relative, to, modern, lampreys, and, while, they, had, well, developed, oral, discs, with, a, small, number, of, radially, arranged, teeth, they, lacked, the, specialised, heavily, toothed, discs, with, plate, like, laminae, present, in, modern, lampreys, and, it, is, possible, that, they, fed, by, scraping, algae, off, of, animals, rather, than, feeding, by, predation, parasitism, they, also, lacked, the, modern, three, stage, life, cycle, including, ammocoetes, found, in, modern, lampreys, with, the, juvenile, stages, of, these, species, closely, resembling, adults, myxineidus, from, the, carboniferous, of, france, often, considered, to, be, a, hagfish, has, been, found, to, be, a, lamprey, in, some, studies, the, earliest, lamprey, with, the, specialised, toothed, oral, disc, typical, of, modern, lampreys, is, yanliaomyzon, from, the, middle, jurassic, of, china, around, 163, million, years, old, which, is, thought, to, have, had, a, predatory, lifestyle, like, modern, lampreys, and, probably, had, a, three, stage, life, cycle, including, ammocoetes, mesomyzon, from, the, early, cretaceous, of, china, which, displays, the, three, stage, life, cycle, with, ammocoetes, was, found, in, one, study, to, be, more, closely, related, to, the, family, petromyzonidae, than, to, other, living, lampreys, though, other, studies, have, found, it, to, be, outside, the, group, containing, all, living, lampreys, synapomorphies, are, certain, characteristics, that, are, shared, over, evolutionary, history, organisms, possessing, a, notochord, dorsal, hollow, nerve, cord, pharyngeal, slits, pituitary, gland, endostyle, and, a, post, anal, tail, during, the, process, of, their, development, are, considered, to, be, chordates, lampreys, contain, these, characteristics, that, define, them, as, chordates, lamprey, anatomy, is, very, different, based, on, what, stage, of, development, they, are, in, the, notochord, is, derived, from, the, mesoderm, and, is, one, of, the, defining, characteristics, of, a, chordate, the, notochord, provides, signaling, and, mechanical, cues, to, help, the, organism, when, swimming, the, dorsal, nerve, cord, is, another, characteristic, of, lampreys, that, defines, them, as, chordates, during, development, this, part, of, the, ectoderm, rolls, creating, a, hollow, tube, this, is, often, why, it, is, referred, to, as, the, dorsal, hollow, nerve, cord, the, third, chordate, feature, which, are, the, pharyngeal, slits, are, openings, found, between, the, pharynx, or, throat, pharyngeal, slits, are, filter, feeding, organs, that, help, the, movement, of, water, through, the, mouth, and, out, of, these, slits, when, feeding, during, the, lamprey, s, larval, stage, they, feed, by, filter, feeding, once, lampreys, reach, their, adult, phase, they, become, parasitic, on, other, fish, and, these, gill, slits, become, very, important, in, aiding, in, the, respiration, of, the, organism, the, final, chordate, synapomorphy, is, the, post, anal, tail, which, is, muscular, and, extends, behind, the, anus, oftentimes, adult, amphioxus, and, lamprey, larvae, are, compared, by, anatomists, due, to, their, similarities, similarities, between, adult, amphioxus, and, lamprey, larvae, include, a, pharynx, with, pharyngeal, slits, a, notochord, a, dorsal, hollow, nerve, cord, and, a, series, of, somites, that, extend, anterior, to, the, otic, vesicle, the, lamprey, has, been, extensively, studied, because, its, relatively, simple, brain, is, thought, in, many, respects, to, reflect, the, brain, structure, of, early, vertebrate, ancestors, beginning, in, the, 1970s, sten, grillner, and, his, colleagues, at, the, karolinska, institute, in, stockholm, followed, on, from, extensive, work, on, the, lamprey, started, by, carl, rovainen, in, the, 1960s, that, used, the, lamprey, as, a, model, system, to, work, out, the, fundamental, principles, of, motor, control, in, vertebrates, starting, in, the, spinal, cord, and, working, toward, the, brain, in, a, series, of, studies, by, rovainen, and, his, student, james, buchanan, the, cells, that, formed, the, neural, circuits, within, the, spinal, cord, capable, of, generating, the, rhythmic, motor, patterns, that, underlie, swimming, were, examined, note, that, there, are, still, missing, details, in, the, network, scheme, despite, claims, by, grillner, that, the, network, is, characterised, parker, 2006, 2010, spinal, cord, circuits, are, controlled, by, specific, locomotor, areas, in, the, brainstem, and, midbrain, and, these, areas, are, in, turn, controlled, by, higher, brain, structures, including, the, basal, ganglia, and, tectum, in, a, study, of, the, lamprey, tectum, published, in, 2007, they, found, electrical, stimulation, could, elicit, eye, movements, lateral, bending, movements, or, swimming, activity, and, the, type, amplitude, and, direction, of, movement, varied, as, a, function, of, the, location, within, the, tectum, that, was, stimulated, these, findings, were, interpreted, as, consistent, with, the, idea, that, the, tectum, generates, goal, directed, locomotion, in, the, lamprey, lampreys, are, used, as, a, model, organism, in, biomedical, research, where, their, large, reticulospinal, axons, are, used, to, investigate, synaptic, transmission, the, axons, of, lamprey, are, particularly, large, and, allow, for, microinjection, of, substances, for, experimental, manipulation, they, are, also, capable, of, full, functional, recovery, after, complete, spinal, cord, transection, another, trait, is, the, ability, to, delete, several, genes, from, their, somatic, cell, lineages, about, 20, of, their, dna, which, are, vital, during, development, of, the, embryo, but, which, in, humans, can, cause, problems, such, as, cancer, later, in, life, after, they, have, served, their, purpose, how, the, genes, destined, for, deletion, are, targeted, is, not, yet, known, although, attacks, on, humans, have, been, documented, they, will, generally, not, attack, humans, unless, starved, people, have, long, eaten, lampreys, they, were, highly, appreciated, by, the, ancient, romans, during, the, middle, ages, they, were, widely, eaten, by, the, upper, classes, throughout, europe, especially, during, lent, when, eating, meat, was, prohibited, due, to, their, meaty, taste, and, texture, king, henry, i, of, england, is, claimed, to, have, been, so, fond, of, lampreys, that, he, often, ate, them, late, into, life, and, poor, health, against, the, advice, of, his, physician, concerning, their, richness, and, is, said, to, have, died, from, eating, a, surfeit, of, lampreys, whether, or, not, his, lamprey, indulgence, actually, caused, his, death, is, unclear, but, the, phrase, persists, in, british, culture, a, lamprey, pie, was, made, for, the, coronation, of, elizabeth, ii, in, 1953, sixty, years, later, the, city, of, gloucester, had, to, use, fish, from, north, america, for, her, diamond, jubilee, because, few, lampreys, could, be, found, in, the, river, severn, in, southwestern, europe, portugal, spain, and, france, finland, and, in, latvia, where, lamprey, is, routinely, sold, in, supermarkets, lampreys, are, a, highly, prized, delicacy, in, finland, county, of, nakkila, and, latvia, carnikava,
