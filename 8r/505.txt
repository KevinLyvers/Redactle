see, text, the, galaxiidae, are, a, family, of, mostly, small, freshwater, fish, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, majority, live, in, southern, australia, or, new, zealand, but, some, are, found, in, south, africa, southern, south, america, lord, howe, island, new, caledonia, and, the, falkland, islands, one, galaxiid, species, the, common, galaxias, galaxias, maculatus, is, probably, the, most, widely, naturally, distributed, freshwater, fish, in, the, southern, hemisphere, they, are, coolwater, species, found, in, temperate, latitudes, with, only, one, species, known, from, subtropical, habitats, many, specialise, in, living, in, cold, high, altitude, upland, rivers, streams, and, lakes, some, galaxiids, live, in, fresh, water, all, their, lives, but, many, have, a, partially, marine, lifecycle, in, these, cases, larvae, are, hatched, in, a, river, but, are, washed, downstream, to, the, ocean, later, returning, to, rivers, as, juveniles, to, complete, their, development, to, full, adulthood, this, pattern, differs, from, that, of, salmon, which, only, return, to, fresh, water, to, breed, and, is, described, as, amphidromous, freshwater, galaxiid, species, are, gravely, threatened, by, exotic, salmonid, species, particularly, trout, species, which, prey, upon, galaxiids, and, compete, with, them, for, food, exotic, salmonids, have, been, recklessly, introduced, to, many, different, land, masses, e, g, australia, new, zealand, with, no, thought, as, to, impacts, on, native, fish, or, attempts, to, preserve, salmonid, free, habitats, for, them, numerous, localised, extinctions, of, galaxiid, species, have, been, caused, by, the, introduction, of, exotic, salmonids, and, a, number, of, freshwater, galaxiid, species, are, threatened, with, overall, extinction, by, exotic, salmonids, phylogenetic, evidence, alternatively, places, galaxiids, within, the, protacanthopterygii, or, more, recently, as, the, sister, group, to, the, neoteleostei, their, ancestors, are, thought, to, have, diverged, from, the, neoteleosts, around, the, triassic, jurassic, boundary, the, earliest, definitive, fossils, of, galaxiids, are, from, the, miocene, of, new, zealand, which, can, be, placed, in, the, extant, genus, galaxias, this, young, fossil, range, contrasts, with, the, presumed, ancient, origins, of, the, group, in, 1998, a, possible, late, cretaceous, maastrichtian, galaxiid, from, south, africa, was, described, as, stompooria, however, later, studies, have, questioned, this, assignment, as, stompooria, differs, from, galaxiids, in, many, morphological, traits, especially, in, the, presence, of, scales, although, it, being, an, ancestral, galaxiid, that, had, not, yet, developed, galaxiid, traits, could, not, be, ruled, out, other, taxonomic, treatments, have, instead, placed, stompooria, as, part, of, an, extinct, clade, sister, to, the, esociformes, and, salmoniformes, about, 50, species, are, in, the, family, galaxiidae, grouped, into, seven, genera, galaxiids, are, found, around, the, south, eastern, seaboard, of, australia, and, in, some, parts, of, south, western, australia, the, galaxiids, and, the, temperate, perches, percichthyidae, are, the, dominant, native, freshwater, fish, families, of, southern, australia, species, common, to, all, areas, include, south, east, australian, mainland, threatened, species, are, western, australia, tasmania, seventeen, species, of, galaxiids, have, been, found, in, tasmania, the, most, common, species, are, tasmanian, endangered, species, include, twenty, three, species, of, galaxiids, have, been, discovered, in, new, zealand, and, prior, to, the, introduction, of, non, native, species, such, as, trout, they, were, the, dominant, freshwater, fish, family, most, of, these, live, in, fresh, water, all, their, lives, however, the, larvae, of, five, species, of, the, genus, galaxias, develop, in, the, ocean, where, they, form, part, of, the, zooplankton, and, return, to, rivers, and, streams, as, juveniles, whitebait, where, they, develop, and, remain, as, adults, all, galaxias, species, found, in, new, zealand, are, endemic, except, for, galaxias, brevipinnis, koaro, and, galaxias, maculatus, inanga, the, juveniles, of, those, galaxiids, that, develop, in, the, ocean, and, then, move, into, rivers, for, their, adult, lives, are, caught, as, whitebait, while, moving, upstream, and, are, much, valued, as, a, delicacy, adult, galaxiids, may, be, caught, for, food, but, they, are, generally, not, large, in, some, cases, their, exploitation, may, be, banned, e, g, new, zealand, unless, available, to, indigenous, tribes, in, addition, to, serious, impacts, from, exotic, trout, species, australian, adult, galaxiids, suffer, a, disregard, from, anglers, for, being, too, small, and, not, being, trout, this, is, despite, the, fact, that, several, australian, galaxiid, species, though, smallish, grow, to, a, sufficient, size, to, be, catchable, and, readily, take, wet, and, dry, flies, and, that, one, of, these, species, the, spotted, galaxias, was, keenly, fished, for, in, australia, before, the, introduction, of, exotic, trout, species, a, handful, of, fly, fishing, exponents, in, australia, are, rediscovering, the, pleasure, of, catching, and, releasing, these, australian, native, fish, on, ultralight, fly, fishing,
