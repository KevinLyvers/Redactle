medicine, is, the, science, and, practice, of, caring, for, patients, managing, the, diagnosis, prognosis, prevention, treatment, palliation, of, their, injury, or, disease, and, promoting, their, health, medicine, encompasses, a, variety, of, health, care, practices, evolved, to, maintain, and, restore, health, by, the, prevention, and, treatment, of, illness, contemporary, medicine, applies, biomedical, sciences, biomedical, research, genetics, and, medical, technology, to, diagnose, treat, and, prevent, injury, and, disease, typically, through, pharmaceuticals, or, surgery, but, also, through, therapies, as, diverse, as, psychotherapy, external, splints, and, traction, medical, devices, biologics, and, ionizing, radiation, amongst, others, medicine, has, been, practiced, since, prehistoric, times, and, for, most, of, this, time, it, was, an, art, an, area, of, creativity, and, skill, frequently, having, connections, to, the, religious, and, philosophical, beliefs, of, local, culture, for, example, a, medicine, man, would, apply, herbs, and, say, prayers, for, healing, or, an, ancient, philosopher, and, physician, would, apply, bloodletting, according, to, the, theories, of, humorism, in, recent, centuries, since, the, advent, of, modern, science, most, medicine, has, become, a, combination, of, art, and, science, both, basic, and, applied, under, the, umbrella, of, medical, science, for, example, while, stitching, technique, for, sutures, is, an, art, learned, through, practice, knowledge, of, what, happens, at, the, cellular, and, molecular, level, in, the, tissues, being, stitched, arises, through, science, prescientific, forms, of, medicine, now, known, as, traditional, medicine, or, folk, medicine, remain, commonly, used, in, the, absence, of, scientific, medicine, and, are, thus, called, alternative, medicine, alternative, treatments, outside, of, scientific, medicine, with, ethical, safety, and, efficacy, concerns, are, termed, quackery, medicine, uk, m, d, s, n, us, m, d, s, n, is, the, science, and, practice, of, the, diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and, prevention, of, disease, the, word, medicine, is, derived, from, latin, medicus, meaning, a, physician, medical, availability, and, clinical, practice, vary, across, the, world, due, to, regional, differences, in, culture, and, technology, modern, scientific, medicine, is, highly, developed, in, the, western, world, while, in, developing, countries, such, as, parts, of, africa, or, asia, the, population, may, rely, more, heavily, on, traditional, medicine, with, limited, evidence, and, efficacy, and, no, required, formal, training, for, practitioners, in, the, developed, world, evidence, based, medicine, is, not, universally, used, in, clinical, practice, for, example, a, 2007, survey, of, literature, reviews, found, that, about, 49, of, the, interventions, lacked, sufficient, evidence, to, support, either, benefit, or, harm, in, modern, clinical, practice, physicians, and, physician, assistants, personally, assess, patients, to, diagnose, prognose, treat, and, prevent, disease, using, clinical, judgment, the, doctor, patient, relationship, typically, begins, with, an, interaction, with, an, examination, of, the, patient, s, medical, history, and, medical, record, followed, by, a, medical, interview, and, a, physical, examination, basic, diagnostic, medical, devices, e, g, stethoscope, tongue, depressor, are, typically, used, after, examining, for, signs, and, interviewing, for, symptoms, the, doctor, may, order, medical, tests, e, g, blood, tests, take, a, biopsy, or, prescribe, pharmaceutical, drugs, or, other, therapies, differential, diagnosis, methods, help, to, rule, out, conditions, based, on, the, information, provided, during, the, encounter, properly, informing, the, patient, of, all, relevant, facts, is, an, important, part, of, the, relationship, and, the, development, of, trust, the, medical, encounter, is, then, documented, in, the, medical, record, which, is, a, legal, document, in, many, jurisdictions, follow, ups, may, be, shorter, but, follow, the, same, general, procedure, and, specialists, follow, a, similar, process, the, diagnosis, and, treatment, may, take, only, a, few, minutes, or, a, few, weeks, depending, on, the, complexity, of, the, issue, the, components, of, the, medical, interview, and, encounter, are, the, physical, examination, is, the, examination, of, the, patient, for, medical, signs, of, disease, that, are, objective, and, observable, in, contrast, to, symptoms, that, are, volunteered, by, the, patient, and, are, not, necessarily, objectively, observable, the, healthcare, provider, uses, sight, hearing, touch, and, sometimes, smell, e, g, in, infection, uremia, diabetic, ketoacidosis, four, actions, are, the, basis, of, physical, examination, inspection, palpation, feel, percussion, tap, to, determine, resonance, characteristics, and, auscultation, listen, generally, in, that, order, although, auscultation, occurs, prior, to, percussion, and, palpation, for, abdominal, assessments, the, clinical, examination, involves, the, study, of, it, is, to, likely, focus, on, areas, of, interest, highlighted, in, the, medical, history, and, may, not, include, everything, listed, above, the, treatment, plan, may, include, ordering, additional, medical, laboratory, tests, and, medical, imaging, studies, starting, therapy, referral, to, a, specialist, or, watchful, observation, a, follow, up, may, be, advised, depending, upon, the, health, insurance, plan, and, the, managed, care, system, various, forms, of, utilization, review, such, as, prior, authorization, of, tests, may, place, barriers, on, accessing, expensive, services, the, medical, decision, making, mdm, process, includes, the, analysis, and, synthesis, of, all, the, above, data, to, come, up, with, a, list, of, possible, diagnoses, the, differential, diagnoses, along, with, an, idea, of, what, needs, to, be, done, to, obtain, a, definitive, diagnosis, that, would, explain, the, patient, s, problem, on, subsequent, visits, the, process, may, be, repeated, in, an, abbreviated, manner, to, obtain, any, new, history, symptoms, physical, findings, lab, or, imaging, results, or, specialist, consultations, contemporary, medicine, is, in, general, conducted, within, health, care, systems, legal, credentialing, and, financing, frameworks, are, established, by, individual, governments, augmented, on, occasion, by, international, organizations, such, as, churches, the, characteristics, of, any, given, health, care, system, have, a, significant, impact, on, the, way, medical, care, is, provided, from, ancient, times, christian, emphasis, on, practical, charity, gave, rise, to, the, development, of, systematic, nursing, and, hospitals, and, the, catholic, church, today, remains, the, largest, non, government, provider, of, medical, services, in, the, world, advanced, industrial, countries, with, the, exception, of, the, united, states, and, many, developing, countries, provide, medical, services, through, a, system, of, universal, health, care, that, aims, to, guarantee, care, for, all, through, a, single, payer, health, care, system, or, compulsory, private, or, cooperative, health, insurance, this, is, intended, to, ensure, that, the, entire, population, has, access, to, medical, care, on, the, basis, of, need, rather, than, ability, to, pay, delivery, may, be, via, private, medical, practices, state, owned, hospitals, and, clinics, or, charities, most, commonly, a, combination, of, all, three, most, tribal, societies, provide, no, guarantee, of, healthcare, for, the, population, as, a, whole, in, such, societies, healthcare, is, available, to, those, who, can, afford, to, pay, for, it, have, self, insured, it, either, directly, or, as, part, of, an, employment, contract, or, may, be, covered, by, care, financed, directly, by, the, government, or, tribe, transparency, of, information, is, another, factor, defining, a, delivery, system, access, to, information, on, conditions, treatments, quality, and, pricing, greatly, affects, the, choice, of, patients, consumers, and, therefore, the, incentives, of, medical, professionals, while, the, us, healthcare, system, has, come, under, fire, for, its, lack, of, openness, new, legislation, may, encourage, greater, openness, there, is, a, perceived, tension, between, the, need, for, transparency, on, the, one, hand, and, such, issues, as, patient, confidentiality, and, the, possible, exploitation, of, information, for, commercial, gain, on, the, other, the, health, professionals, who, provide, care, in, medicine, comprise, multiple, professions, such, as, medics, nurses, physiotherapists, and, psychologists, these, professions, will, have, their, own, ethical, standards, professional, education, and, bodies, the, medical, profession, has, been, conceptualized, from, a, sociological, perspective, provision, of, medical, care, is, classified, into, primary, secondary, and, tertiary, care, categories, primary, care, medical, services, are, provided, by, physicians, physician, assistants, nurse, practitioners, or, other, health, professionals, who, have, first, contact, with, a, patient, seeking, medical, treatment, or, care, these, occur, in, physician, offices, clinics, nursing, homes, schools, home, visits, and, other, places, close, to, patients, about, 90, of, medical, visits, can, be, treated, by, the, primary, care, provider, these, include, treatment, of, acute, and, chronic, illnesses, preventive, care, and, health, education, for, all, ages, and, both, sexes, secondary, care, medical, services, are, provided, by, medical, specialists, in, their, offices, or, clinics, or, at, local, community, hospitals, for, a, patient, referred, by, a, primary, care, provider, who, first, diagnosed, or, treated, the, patient, referrals, are, made, for, those, patients, who, required, the, expertise, or, procedures, performed, by, specialists, these, include, both, ambulatory, care, and, inpatient, services, emergency, departments, intensive, care, medicine, surgery, services, physical, therapy, labor, and, delivery, endoscopy, units, diagnostic, laboratory, and, medical, imaging, services, hospice, centers, etc, some, primary, care, providers, may, also, take, care, of, hospitalized, patients, and, deliver, babies, in, a, secondary, care, setting, tertiary, care, medical, services, are, provided, by, specialist, hospitals, or, regional, centers, equipped, with, diagnostic, and, treatment, facilities, not, generally, available, at, local, hospitals, these, include, trauma, centers, burn, treatment, centers, advanced, neonatology, unit, services, organ, transplants, high, risk, pregnancy, radiation, oncology, etc, modern, medical, care, also, depends, on, information, still, delivered, in, many, health, care, settings, on, paper, records, but, increasingly, nowadays, by, electronic, means, in, low, income, countries, modern, healthcare, is, often, too, expensive, for, the, average, person, international, healthcare, policy, researchers, have, advocated, that, user, fees, be, removed, in, these, areas, to, ensure, access, although, even, after, removal, significant, costs, and, barriers, remain, separation, of, prescribing, and, dispensing, is, a, practice, in, medicine, and, pharmacy, in, which, the, physician, who, provides, a, medical, prescription, is, independent, from, the, pharmacist, who, provides, the, prescription, drug, in, the, western, world, there, are, centuries, of, tradition, for, separating, pharmacists, from, physicians, in, asian, countries, it, is, traditional, for, physicians, to, also, provide, drugs, working, together, as, an, interdisciplinary, team, many, highly, trained, health, professionals, besides, medical, practitioners, are, involved, in, the, delivery, of, modern, health, care, examples, include, nurses, emergency, medical, technicians, and, paramedics, laboratory, scientists, pharmacists, podiatrists, physiotherapists, respiratory, therapists, speech, therapists, occupational, therapists, radiographers, dietitians, and, bioengineers, medical, physicists, surgeons, surgeon, s, assistant, surgical, technologist, the, scope, and, sciences, underpinning, human, medicine, overlap, many, other, fields, a, patient, admitted, to, the, hospital, is, usually, under, the, care, of, a, specific, team, based, on, their, main, presenting, problem, e, g, the, cardiology, team, who, then, may, interact, with, other, specialties, e, g, surgical, radiology, to, help, diagnose, or, treat, the, main, problem, or, any, subsequent, complications, developments, physicians, have, many, specializations, and, subspecializations, into, certain, branches, of, medicine, which, are, listed, below, there, are, variations, from, country, to, country, regarding, which, specialties, certain, subspecialties, are, in, the, main, branches, of, medicine, are, in, the, broadest, meaning, of, medicine, there, are, many, different, specialties, in, the, uk, most, specialities, have, their, own, body, or, college, which, has, its, own, entrance, examination, these, are, collectively, known, as, the, royal, colleges, although, not, all, currently, use, the, term, royal, the, development, of, a, speciality, is, often, driven, by, new, technology, such, as, the, development, of, effective, anaesthetics, or, ways, of, working, such, as, emergency, departments, the, new, specialty, leads, to, the, formation, of, a, unifying, body, of, doctors, and, the, prestige, of, administering, their, own, examination, within, medical, circles, specialities, usually, fit, into, one, of, two, broad, categories, medicine, and, surgery, medicine, refers, to, the, practice, of, non, operative, medicine, and, most, of, its, subspecialties, require, preliminary, training, in, internal, medicine, in, the, uk, this, was, traditionally, evidenced, by, passing, the, examination, for, the, membership, of, the, royal, college, of, physicians, mrcp, or, the, equivalent, college, in, scotland, or, ireland, surgery, refers, to, the, practice, of, operative, medicine, and, most, subspecialties, in, this, area, require, preliminary, training, in, general, surgery, which, in, the, uk, leads, to, membership, of, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, of, england, mrcs, at, present, some, specialties, of, medicine, do, not, fit, easily, into, either, of, these, categories, such, as, radiology, pathology, or, anesthesia, most, of, these, have, branched, from, one, or, other, of, the, two, camps, above, for, example, anaesthesia, developed, first, as, a, faculty, of, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, for, which, mrcs, frcs, would, have, been, required, before, becoming, the, royal, college, of, anaesthetists, and, membership, of, the, college, is, attained, by, sitting, for, the, examination, of, the, fellowship, of, the, royal, college, of, anesthetists, frca, surgery, is, an, ancient, medical, specialty, that, uses, operative, manual, and, instrumental, techniques, on, a, patient, to, investigate, or, treat, a, pathological, condition, such, as, disease, or, injury, to, help, improve, bodily, function, or, appearance, or, to, repair, unwanted, ruptured, areas, for, example, a, perforated, ear, drum, surgeons, must, also, manage, pre, operative, post, operative, and, potential, surgical, candidates, on, the, hospital, wards, in, some, centers, anesthesiology, is, part, of, the, division, of, surgery, for, historical, and, logistical, reasons, although, it, is, not, a, surgical, discipline, other, medical, specialties, may, employ, surgical, procedures, such, as, ophthalmology, and, dermatology, but, are, not, considered, surgical, sub, specialties, per, se, surgical, training, in, the, u, s, requires, a, minimum, of, five, years, of, residency, after, medical, school, sub, specialties, of, surgery, often, require, seven, or, more, years, in, addition, fellowships, can, last, an, additional, one, to, three, years, because, post, residency, fellowships, can, be, competitive, many, trainees, devote, two, additional, years, to, research, thus, in, some, cases, surgical, training, will, not, finish, until, more, than, a, decade, after, medical, school, furthermore, surgical, training, can, be, very, difficult, and, time, consuming, surgical, subspecialties, include, those, a, physician, may, specialize, in, after, undergoing, general, surgery, residency, training, as, well, as, several, surgical, fields, with, separate, residency, training, surgical, subspecialties, that, one, may, pursue, following, general, surgery, residency, training, other, surgical, specialties, within, medicine, with, their, own, individual, residency, training, internal, medicine, is, the, medical, specialty, dealing, with, the, prevention, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, adult, diseases, according, to, some, sources, an, emphasis, on, internal, structures, is, implied, in, north, america, specialists, in, internal, medicine, are, commonly, called, internists, elsewhere, especially, in, commonwealth, nations, such, specialists, are, often, called, physicians, these, terms, internist, or, physician, in, the, narrow, sense, common, outside, north, america, generally, exclude, practitioners, of, gynecology, and, obstetrics, pathology, psychiatry, and, especially, surgery, and, its, subspecialities, because, their, patients, are, often, seriously, ill, or, require, complex, investigations, internists, do, much, of, their, work, in, hospitals, formerly, many, internists, were, not, subspecialized, such, general, physicians, would, see, any, complex, nonsurgical, problem, this, style, of, practice, has, become, much, less, common, in, modern, urban, practice, most, internists, are, subspecialists, that, is, they, generally, limit, their, medical, practice, to, problems, of, one, organ, system, or, to, one, particular, area, of, medical, knowledge, for, example, gastroenterologists, and, nephrologists, specialize, respectively, in, diseases, of, the, gut, and, the, kidneys, in, the, commonwealth, of, nations, and, some, other, countries, specialist, pediatricians, and, geriatricians, are, also, described, as, specialist, physicians, or, internists, who, have, subspecialized, by, age, of, patient, rather, than, by, organ, system, elsewhere, especially, in, north, america, general, pediatrics, is, often, a, form, of, primary, care, there, are, many, subspecialities, or, subdisciplines, of, internal, medicine, training, in, internal, medicine, as, opposed, to, surgical, training, varies, considerably, across, the, world, see, the, articles, on, medical, education, for, more, details, in, north, america, it, requires, at, least, three, years, of, residency, training, after, medical, school, which, can, then, be, followed, by, a, one, to, three, year, fellowship, in, the, subspecialties, listed, above, in, general, resident, work, hours, in, medicine, are, less, than, those, in, surgery, averaging, about, 60, hours, per, week, in, the, us, this, difference, does, not, apply, in, the, uk, where, all, doctors, are, now, required, by, law, to, work, less, than, 48, hours, per, week, on, average, the, following, are, some, major, medical, specialties, that, do, not, directly, fit, into, any, of, the, above, mentioned, groups, some, interdisciplinary, sub, specialties, of, medicine, include, medical, education, and, training, varies, around, the, world, it, typically, involves, entry, level, education, at, a, university, medical, school, followed, by, a, period, of, supervised, practice, or, internship, or, residency, this, can, be, followed, by, postgraduate, vocational, training, a, variety, of, teaching, methods, have, been, employed, in, medical, education, still, itself, a, focus, of, active, research, in, canada, and, the, united, states, of, america, a, doctor, of, medicine,

a, recognized, university, since, knowledge, techniques, and, medical, technology, continue, to, evolve, at, a, rapid, rate, many, regulatory, authorities, require, continuing, medical, education, medical, practitioners, upgrade, their, knowledge, in, various, ways, including, medical, journals, seminars, conferences, and, online, programs, a, database, of, objectives, covering, medical,

by, a, medical, board, or, an, equivalent, national, organization, which, may, ask, the, applicant, to, pass, exams, this, restricts, the, considerable, legal, authority, of, the, medical, profession, to, physicians, that, are, trained, and, qualified, by, national, standards, it, is, also, intended, as, an, assurance, to, patients, and, as, a, safeguard, against, charlatans, that, practice, inadequate, medicine, for, personal, gain, while, the, laws, generally, require, medical, doctors, to, be, trained, in, evidence, based, western, or, hippocratic, medicine, they, are, not, intended,

its, history, philosophy, theology, and, sociology, six, of, the, values, that, commonly, apply, to, medical, ethics, discussions, are, values, such, as, these, do, not, give, answers, as, to, how, to, handle, a, particular, situation, but, provide, a, useful, framework, for, understanding, conflicts, when, moral, values, are, in, conflict, the, result, may, be, an, ethical, dilemma, or, crisis, sometimes, no, good, solution, to, a, dilemma, in, medical, ethics, exists, and, occasionally, the, values, of, the, medical, community, i, e, the, hospital, and, its, staff, conflict, with, the, values, of, the, individual, patient, family, or, larger, non, medical, community, conflicts, can, also, arise, between, health, care, providers, or, among, family, members, for, example, some, argue,

hippocrates, the, father, of, modern, medicine, laid, the, foundation, for, a, rational, approach, to, medicine, hippocrates, introduced, the, hippocratic, oath, for, physicians, which, is, still, relevant, and, in, use, today, and, was, the, first, to, categorize, illnesses, as, acute, chronic, endemic, and, epidemic, and, use, terms, such, as, exacerbation, relapse, resolution, crisis, paroxysm, peak, and, convalescence, the, greek, physician, galen, was, also, one, of, the, greatest, surgeons, of, the, ancient, world, and, performed, many, audacious, operations, including, brain, and, eye, surgeries, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, and, the, onset, of, the, early, middle, ages, the, greek, tradition, of, medicine, went, into, decline, in, western, europe,

christian, charity, rather, than, just, merely, a, place, to, die, appeared, in, the, byzantine, empire, although, the, concept, of, uroscopy, was, known, to, galen, he, did, not, see, the, importance, of, using, it, to, localize, the, disease, it, was, under, the, byzantines, with, physicians, such, of, theophilus, protospatharius, that, they, realized, the, potential, in, uroscopy, to, determine, disease, in, a, time, when, no, microscope, or, stethoscope, existed, that, practice, eventually, spread, to, the, rest, of, europe, after, 750, ce, the, muslim, world, had, the, works, of,

some, volumes, of, rhazes, s, work, al, mansuri, namely, on, surgery, and, a, general, book, on, therapy, became, part, of, the, medical, curriculum, in, european, universities, additionally, he, has, been, described, as, a, doctor, s, doctor, the, father, of, pediatrics, and, a, pioneer, of, ophthalmology, for, example, he, was, the, first, to, recognize, the, reaction, of, the, eye, s, pupil, to,

monastery, and, the, historian, geoffrey, blainey, likened, the, activities, of, the, catholic, church, in, health, care, during, the, middle, ages, to, an, early, version, of, a, welfare, state, it, conducted, hospitals, for, the, old, and, orphanages, for, the, young, hospices, for, the, sick, of, all, ages, places, for, the, lepers, and, hostels, or, inns, where, pilgrims, could, buy, a, cheap,

becoming, the, chief, medical, care, givers, of, their, districts, as, at, the, great, abbey, of, cluny, the, church, also, established, a, network, of, cathedral, schools, and, universities, where, medicine, was, studied, the, schola, medica, salernitana, in, salerno, looking, to, the, learning, of, greek, and, arab, physicians, grew, to, be, the, finest, medical, school, in, medieval, europe, however, the, fourteenth, and, fifteenth, century, black, death, devastated, both, the, middle, east, and, europe, and, it, has, even, been, argued, that, western, europe, was, generally, more, effective, in, recovering, from, the, pandemic, than, the, middle, east, in, the, early, modern, period, important, early, figures, in, medicine, and, anatomy, emerged, in, europe, including, gabriele, falloppio, and, william, harvey, the, major, shift, in, medical, thinking, was, the, gradual, rejection, especially, during, the, black, death, in, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, of, what, may, be, called, the, traditional, authority, approach, to, science, and, medicine, this, was, the, notion, that, because, some, prominent, person, in, the, past, said, something, must, be, so, then, that, was, the, way, it, was, and, anything, one, observed, to, the, contrary, was, an, anomaly, which, was, paralleled, by, a, similar, shift, in, european, society, in, general, see, copernicus, s, rejection, of, ptolemy, s, theories, on, astronomy, physicians, like, vesalius, improved, upon, or, disproved, some, of, the, theories, from, the, past, the, main, tomes, used, both, by, medicine, students, and, expert, physicians, were, materia, medica, and, pharmacopoeia, andreas, vesalius, was, the, author, of, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, an, important, book, on, human, anatomy, bacteria, and, microorganisms, were, first, observed, with, a, microscope, by, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, in, 1676, initiating, the, scientific, field, microbiology, independently, from, ibn, al, nafis, michael, servetus, rediscovered, the, pulmonary, circulation, but, this, discovery, did, not, reach, the, public, because, it, was, written, down, for, the, first, time, in, the, manuscript, of, paris, in, 1546, and, later, published, in, the, theological, work, for, which, he, paid, with, his, life, in, 1553, later, this, was, described, by, renaldus, columbus, and, andrea, cesalpino,

called, the, father, of, modern, dentistry, veterinary, medicine, was, for, the, first, time, truly, separated, from, human, medicine, in, 1761, when, the, french, veterinarian, claude, bourgelat, founded, the, world, s, first, veterinary, school, in, lyon, france, before, this, medical, doctors, treated, both, humans, and, other, animals, modern, scientific, biomedical, research, where, results, are, testable, and, reproducible, began, to, replace, early, western, traditions, based, on, herbalism, the, greek, four, humours, and, other, such, pre, modern, notions, the, modern, era, really, began, with, edward, jenner, s, discovery, of, the, smallpox, vaccine, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, inspired, by, the, method, of, variolation, originated, in, ancient, china, robert, koch, s, discoveries, around, 1880, of, the, transmission, of, disease, by, bacteria, and, then, the, discovery, of, antibiotics, around, 1900, the, post, 18th, century, modernity, period, brought, more, groundbreaking, researchers, from, europe, from, germany, and, austria, doctors, rudolf, virchow, wilhelm, conrad, r, ntgen, karl, landsteiner, and, otto, loewi, made, notable, contributions, in, the, united, kingdom, alexander, fleming, joseph, lister, francis, crick, and, florence, nightingale, are, considered, important, spanish, doctor, santiago, ram, n, y, cajal, is, considered, the, father, of, modern, neuroscience, from, new, zealand, and, australia, came, maurice, wilkins, howard, florey, and, frank, macfarlane, burnet, others, that, did, significant, work, include, william,

reliant, upon, medications, throughout, history, and, in, europe, right, until, the, late, 18th, century, not, only, plant, products, were, used, as, medicine, but, also, animal, including, human, body, parts, and, fluids, pharmacology, developed, in, part, from, herbalism, and, some, drugs, are, still, derived, from, plants, atropine, ephedrine, warfarin, aspirin, digoxin, vinca, alkaloids, taxol, hyoscine, etc, vaccines, were, discovered, by, edward, jenner, and, louis, pasteur, the, first, antibiotic, was, arsphenamine, salvarsan, discovered, by, paul, ehrlich, in, 1908, after, he, observed, that, bacteria, took, up, toxic, dyes, that, human, cells, did, not, the, first, major, class, of, antibiotics, was, the, sulfa, drugs, derived, by, german, chemists, originally, from, azo, dyes, pharmacology, has, become, increasingly, sophisticated, modern, biotechnology, allows, drugs, targeted, towards, specific, physiological, processes, to, be, developed, sometimes, designed, for, compatibility, with, the, body, to, reduce, side, effects, genomics, and, knowledge, of, human, genetics, and, human, evolution, is, having, increasingly, significant, influence, on, medicine, as, the, causative, genes, of, most, monogenic, genetic, disorders, have, now, been, identified, and, the, development, of, techniques, in, molecular, biology, evolution, and, genetics, are, influencing, medical, technology, practice, and, decision, making, evidence, based, medicine, is, a, contemporary, movement, to, establish, the, most, effective, algorithms, of, practice, ways, of, doing, things, through, the, use, of, systematic, reviews, and, meta, analysis, the, movement, is, facilitated, by, modern, global, information, science, which, allows, as, much, of, the, available, evidence, as, possible, to, be, collected, and, analyzed, according, to, standard, protocols, that, are, then, disseminated, to, healthcare, providers, the, cochrane, collaboration, leads, this, movement, a, 2001, review, of, 160, cochrane, systematic, reviews, revealed, that, according, to, two, readers, 21, 3, of, the, reviews, concluded, insufficient, evidence, 20, concluded, evidence, of, no, effect, and, 22, 5, concluded, positive, effect, evidence, based, medicine, prevention, of, medical, error, and, other, iatrogenesis, and, avoidance, of, unnecessary, health, care, are, a, priority, in, modern, medical, systems, these, topics, generate, significant, political, and, public, policy, attention, particularly, in, the, united, states, where, healthcare, is, regarded, as, excessively, costly, but, population, health, metrics, lag, similar, nations, globally, many, developing, countries, lack, access, to, care, and, access, to, medicines, as, of, 2015, most, wealthy, developed, countries, provide, health, care, to, all, citizens, with, a, few, exceptions, such, as, the, united, states, where, lack, of, health, insurance, coverage, may, limit, access
