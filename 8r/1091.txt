the, hazelnut, is, the, fruit, of, the, hazel, tree, and, therefore, includes, any, of, the, nuts, deriving, from, species, of, the, genus, corylus, especially, the, nuts, of, the, species, corylus, avellana, they, are, also, known, as, cobnuts, or, filberts, according, to, species, hazelnuts, are, used, as, a, snack, food, in, baking, and, desserts, and, in, breakfast, cereals, such, as, muesli, in, confectionery, they, are, used, to, make, praline, and, also, used, in, combination, with, chocolate, for, chocolate, truffles, and, products, such, as, chocolate, bars, and, hazelnut, cocoa, spreads, such, as, nutella, they, are, also, used, in, frangelico, liqueur, hazelnut, oil, pressed, from, hazelnuts, is, strongly, flavored, and, high, in, monounsaturated, fat, it, is, used, as, a, cooking, oil, and, as, a, salad, or, vegetable, dressing, turkey, is, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, hazelnuts, accounting, for, 64, of, total, production, in, 2021, a, hazelnut, cob, is, roughly, spherical, to, oval, about, 15, 25, millimetres, 5, 8, 1, inch, long, and, 10, 15, mm, 3, 8, 5, 8, in, in, diameter, with, an, outer, fibrous, husk, surrounding, a, smooth, shell, while, a, filbert, is, more, elongated, being, about, twice, as, long, as, its, diameter, the, nut, falls, out, of, the, husk, when, ripe, about, seven, to, eight, months, after, pollination, the, seed, is, edible, and, consumed, raw, roasted, or, ground, into, a, paste, the, seed, has, a, thin, dark, brown, skin, which, is, sometimes, removed, before, cooking, in, 1995, evidence, of, large, scale, mesolithic, nut, processing, some, 8, 000, years, old, was, found, in, a, midden, pit, on, the, island, of, colonsay, in, scotland, the, evidence, consists, of, a, large, shallow, pit, full, of, the, remains, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, burned, hazelnut, shells, hazelnuts, have, been, found, on, other, mesolithic, sites, but, rarely, in, such, quantities, or, concentrated, in, one, pit, the, nuts, were, radiocarbon, dated, to, 7720, 110, bp, which, calibrates, to, c, 6000, bce, similar, sites, in, britain, are, known, only, at, farnham, in, surrey, and, cass, ny, hawin, on, the, isle, of, man, this, discovery, gives, an, insight, into, communal, activity, and, planning, in, the, period, the, nuts, were, harvested, in, a, single, year, and, pollen, analysis, suggests, that, all, of, the, hazel, trees, were, cut, down, at, the, same, time, the, scale, of, the, activity, and, the, lack, of, large, game, on, the, island, suggest, that, colonsay, may, have, contained, a, community, with, a, largely, vegetarian, diet, for, the, time, they, spent, on, the, island, originally, the, pit, was, on, a, beach, close, to, the, shore, and, was, associated, with, two, smaller, stone, lined, pits, whose, function, remains, obscure, a, hearth, and, a, second, cluster, of, pits, the, traditional, method, to, increase, nut, production, is, called, brutting, which, involves, prompting, more, of, the, tree, energy, to, go, into, flower, bud, production, by, snapping, but, not, breaking, off, the, tips, of, the, new, year, shoots, six, or, seven, leaf, groups, from, where, they, join, with, the, trunk, or, branch, at, the, end, of, the, growing, season, the, traditional, term, for, an, area, of, cultivated, hazelnuts, is, a, plat, the, many, cultivars, of, the, hazel, include, atababa, barcelona, butler, casina, clark, cosford, daviana, delle, langhe, england, ennis, halls, giant, jemtegaard, kent, cob, lewis, tokolyi, tonda, gentile, tonda, di, giffoni, tonda, romana, wanliss, pride, and, willamette, some, of, these, are, grown, for, specific, qualities, of, the, nut, including, large, nut, size, or, early, or, late, fruiting, whereas, others, are, grown, as, pollinators, the, majority, of, commercial, hazelnuts, are, propagated, from, root, sprouts, some, cultivars, are, of, hybrid, origin, between, common, hazel, and, filbert, in, ireland, and, the, united, kingdom, hazelnuts, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, cobnuts, for, which, a, specific, cultivated, variety, kent, cobnuts, is, the, main, variety, cultivated, in, fields, known, as, plats, hand, picked, and, eaten, green, according, to, the, bbc, a, national, collection, of, cobnut, varieties, exists, at, roughway, farm, in, kent, they, are, called, cobnuts, because, cob, was, a, word, used, to, refer, to, the, head, or, noggin, and, children, had, a, game, in, which, they, would, tie, a, string, to, a, hazelnut, and, use, it, to, try, to, hit, an, opponent, on, the, head, in, europe, hazelnuts, are, traditionally, grown, as, multi, trunk, trees, where, the, rootstock, is, formed, by, the, variety, itself, to, enhance, the, possibility, for, mechanization, and, to, prevent, suckering, a, single, trunk, tree, can, be, formed, by, grafting, a, scion, of, the, desired, variety, on, a, corylus, colurna, rootstock, there, are, different, approaches, in, orchard, floor, management, strong, infestations, of, certain, weeds, can, lower, the, yield, therefore, to, prevent, yield, loss, by, competition, herbicides, are, used, to, create, bare, soil, using, cover, crops, protects, the, soil, and, suppresses, weed, establishment, without, a, yield, reduction, silvopastoral, systems, where, animals, like, pigs, are, kept, in, the, orchard, or, silvoarable, systems, where, crops, are, grown, between, the, rows, could, introduce, new, sources, of, revenue, into, the, hazelnut, production, and, may, have, beneficial, effects, on, hazelnut, yield, by, fertilizing, the, soil, through, nitrogen, fixation, or, animal, dung, these, systems, limit, the, plant, protection, measures, potentially, impacting, the, yield, quality, and, level, there, are, very, few, studies, on, these, systems, leading, to, a, higher, uncertainty, for, the, producer, hazelnuts, are, harvested, annually, in, mid, autumn, as, autumn, comes, to, a, close, the, trees, drop, their, nuts, and, leaves, most, commercial, growers, wait, for, the, nuts, to, drop, rather, than, using, equipment, to, shake, them, from, the, tree, the, harvesting, of, hazelnuts, is, performed, either, by, hand, or, by, manual, or, mechanical, raking, of, fallen, nuts, four, primary, pieces, of, equipment, are, used, in, commercial, harvesting, the, sweeper, the, harvester, the, nut, cart, and, the, forklift, the, sweeper, moves, the, nuts, into, the, center, of, the, rows, the, harvester, lifts, and, separates, the, nuts, from, any, debris, i, e, twigs, and, leaves, the, nut, cart, holds, the, nuts, picked, up, by, the, harvester, and, the, forklift, brings, a, tote, to, offload, the, nuts, from, the, nut, cart, and, then, stacks, the, totes, to, be, shipped, to, the, processor, nut, dryer, the, sweeper, is, a, low, to, the, ground, machine, that, makes, two, passes, in, each, tree, row, it, has, a, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, belt, attached, to, the, front, that, rotates, to, sweep, leaves, nuts, and, small, twigs, from, left, to, right, depositing, the, material, in, the, center, of, the, row, as, it, drives, forward, on, the, rear, of, the, sweeper, is, a, powerful, blower, to, blow, material, left, into, the, adjacent, row, with, air, speeds, up, to, 90, m, s, 300, ft, s, careful, grooming, during, the, year, and, patient, blowing, at, harvest, may, eliminate, the, need, for, hand, raking, around, the, tree, trunk, where, nuts, may, accumulate, the, sweeper, prepares, a, single, center, row, of, nuts, narrow, enough, for, the, harvesting, tractor, to, drive, over, without, driving, on, the, center, row, it, is, best, to, sweep, only, a, few, rows, ahead, of, the, harvesters, at, any, given, time, to, prevent, the, tractor, that, drives, the, harvester, from, crushing, the, nuts, that, may, still, be, falling, from, the, trees, hazelnut, orchards, may, be, harvested, up, to, three, times, during, the, harvest, season, depending, on, the, number, of, nuts, in, the, trees, and, the, rate, of, nut, drop, due, to, the, weather, the, harvester, is, a, slow, moving, machine, pushed, by, a, tractor, which, lifts, the, material, off, the, ground, and, separates, the, nuts, from, the, leaves, empty, husks, and, twigs, as, the, harvester, drives, over, the, rows, a, rotating, cylinder, with, hundreds, of, tines, rakes, the, material, onto, a, belt, the, belt, takes, the, material, over, a, blower, and, under, a, powerful, vacuum, that, sucks, any, lightweight, soil, leaves, from, the, nuts, and, discharges, them, into, the, orchard, the, remaining, nuts, are, conveyed, into, a, cart, pulled, behind, the, harvester, once, a, tote, is, filled, with, nuts, the, forklift, hauls, away, the, full, totes, and, brings, empty, ones, back, to, the, harvester, to, maximize, the, harvester, s, time, two, different, timing, strategies, are, used, for, collecting, the, fallen, nuts, the, first, is, to, harvest, early, when, about, half, of, the, nuts, have, fallen, with, less, material, on, the, ground, the, harvester, can, work, faster, with, less, chance, of, a, breakdown, the, second, option, is, to, wait, for, all, the, nuts, to, fall, before, harvesting, although, the, first, option, is, considered, the, better, of, the, two, two, or, three, passes, do, take, more, time, to, complete, than, one, in, 2021, world, production, of, hazelnuts, in, shells, was, 1, 1, million, tonnes, the, hazelnut, production, in, turkey, accounts, for, 64, of, the, world, total, followed, by, italy, the, united, states, and, azerbaijan, as, secondary, producers, hazelnuts, are, used, in, confections, to, make, pralines, chocolate, truffles, and, hazelnut, paste, products, the, solid, combination, of, ground, hazelnuts, with, chocolate, is, called, gianduja, in, austria, hazelnut, paste, is, an, ingredient, for, making, tortes, such, as, viennese, hazelnut, torte, in, kyiv, cake, hazelnut, flour, is, used, to, flavor, its, meringue, body, and, crushed, hazelnuts, are, sprinkled, over, its, sides, dacquoise, a, french, dessert, cake, often, contains, a, layer, of, hazelnut, meringue, hazelnuts, are, used, in, turkish, cuisine, and, georgian, cuisine, the, snack, churchkhela, and, sauce, satsivi, are, used, often, with, walnuts, hazelnuts, are, also, a, common, constituent, of, muesli, the, nuts, may, be, eaten, fresh, or, dried, having, different, flavors, raw, hazelnuts, are, 5, water, 61, fat, 17, carbohydrates, and, 15, protein, table, in, a, 100, gram, 3, 1, 2, ounce, reference, amount, raw, hazelnuts, supply, 2, 630, kilojoules, 628, kilocalories, of, food, energy, and, are, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, numerous, essential, nutrients, see, table, hazelnuts, contain, particularly, high,
