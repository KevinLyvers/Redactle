macadamia, is, a, genus, of, four, species, of, trees, in, the, flowering, plant, family, proteaceae, they, are, indigenous, to, australia, native, to, northeastern, new, south, wales, and, central, and, southeastern, queensland, specifically, two, species, of, the, genus, are, commercially, important, for, their, fruit, the, macadamia, nut, m, k, d, e, m, i, or, simply, macadamia, global, production, in, 2015, was, 160, 000, tonnes, 180, 000, short, tons, other, names, include, queensland, nut, bush, nut, maroochi, nut, bauple, nut, and, in, the, us, they, are, also, known, as, hawaii, nut, it, was, an, important, source, of, bushfood, for, the, aboriginal, peoples, the, nut, was, first, commercially, produced, on, a, wide, scale, in, hawaii, where, australian, seeds, were, introduced, in, the, 1880s, and, for, some, time, they, were, the, world, s, largest, producer, south, africa, has, been, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, the, macadamia, since, the, 2010s, the, german, australian, botanist, ferdinand, von, mueller, gave, the, genus, the, name, macadamia, in, 1857, in, honour, of, the, scottish, australian, chemist, medical, teacher, and, politician, john, macadam, who, was, the, honorary, secretary, of, the, philosophical, institute, of, victoria, beginning, in, 1857, macadamia, is, an, evergreen, genus, that, grows, 2, 12, m, 7, 40, ft, tall, the, leaves, are, arranged, in, whorls, of, three, to, six, lanceolate, to, obovate, or, elliptic, in, shape, 60, 300, mm, 2, 1, 2, 12, in, long, and, 30, 130, mm, 1, 1, 8, 5, 1, 8, in, broad, with, an, entire, or, spiny, serrated, margin, the, flowers, are, produced, in, a, long, slender, and, simple, raceme, 50, 300, mm, 2, 12, in, long, the, individual, flowers, 10, 15, mm, 3, 8, 9, 16, in, long, white, to, pink, or, purple, with, four, tepals, the, fruit, is, a, hard, woody, globose, follicle, with, a, pointed, apex, containing, one, or, two, seeds, the, nutshell, coat, is, particularly, tough, and, requires, around, 2000, n, to, crack, the, shell, material, is, five, times, harder, than, hazelnut, shells, and, has, mechanical, properties, similar, to, aluminum, it, has, a, vickers, hardness, of, 35, nuts, from, m, jansenii, and, m, ternifolia, contain, cyanogenic, glycosides, the, other, two, species, are, cultivated, for, the, commercial, production, of, macadamia, nuts, for, human, consumption, previously, more, species, with, disjunct, distributions, were, named, as, members, of, this, genus, macadamia, genetics, and, morphological, studies, published, in, 2008, show, they, have, separated, from, the, genus, macadamia, correlating, less, closely, than, thought, from, earlier, morphological, studies, the, species, previously, named, in, the, genus, macadamia, may, still, be, referred, to, overall, by, the, descriptive, non, scientific, name, of, macadamia, the, macadamia, tree, is, usually, propagated, by, grafting, and, does, not, begin, to, produce, commercial, quantities, of, seeds, until, it, is, 7, 10, years, old, but, once, established, it, may, continue, bearing, for, over, 100, years, macadamias, prefer, fertile, well, drained, soils, a, rainfall, of, 1, 000, 2, 000, mm, 40, 80, in, and, temperatures, not, falling, below, 10, c, 50, f, although, once, established, they, can, withstand, light, frosts, with, an, optimum, temperature, of, 25, c, 80, f, the, roots, are, shallow, and, trees, can, be, blown, down, in, storms, like, most, proteaceae, they, are, also, susceptible, to, phytophthora, root, disease, as, of, 2019, the, macadamia, nut, is, the, most, expensive, nut, in, the, world, which, is, attributed, to, the, slow, harvesting, process, a, macadamia, integrifolia, m, tetraphylla, hybrid, commercial, variety, is, widely, planted, in, australia, and, new, zealand, dr, j, h, beaumont, discovered, it, it, is, high, in, oil, but, is, not, sweet, new, leaves, are, reddish, and, flowers, are, bright, pink, borne, on, long, racemes, it, is, one, of, the, quickest, varieties, to, come, into, bearing, once, planted, in, the, garden, usually, carrying, a, useful, crop, by, the, fourth, year, and, improving, from, then, on, it, crops, prodigiously, when, well, pollinated, the, impressive, grape, like, clusters, are, sometimes, so, heavy, they, break, the, branchlets, to, which, they, are, attached, commercial, orchards, have, reached, 18, kg, 40, lb, per, tree, by, eight, years, old, on, the, downside, the, macadamias, do, not, drop, from, the, tree, when, ripe, and, the, leaves, are, a, bit, prickly, when, one, reaches, into, the, tree, s, interior, during, harvest, its, shell, is, easier, to, open, than, that, of, most, commercial, varieties, a, pure, m, tetraphylla, variety, from, australia, this, strain, is, cultivated, for, its, productive, crop, yield, flavour, and, suitability, for, pollinating, beaumont, a, south, african, m, integrifolia, m, tetraphylla, hybrid, cultivar, it, has, a, sweet, seed, which, means, it, has, to, be, cooked, carefully, so, that, the, sugars, do, not, caramelise, the, sweet, seed, is, usually, not, fully, processed, as, it, generally, does, not, taste, as, good, but, many, people, enjoy, eating, it, uncooked, it, has, an, open, micropyle, hole, in, the, shell, which, may, let, in, fungal, spores, the, crack, out, percentage, ratio, of, nut, meat, to, the, whole, nut, by, weight, is, high, ten, year, old, trees, average, 22, kg, 50, lb, per, tree, it, is, a, popular, variety, because, of, its, pollination, of, beaumont, and, the, yields, are, almost, comparable, a, m, integrifolia, m, tetraphylla, hybrid, this, is, a, rather, spreading, tree, on, the, plus, side, it, is, high, yielding, commercially, 17, kg, 37, lb, from, a, 9, year, old, tree, has, been, recorded, and, the, nuts, drop, to, the, ground, however, they, are, thick, shelled, with, not, much, flavour, in, 2018, south, africa, was, estimated, as, the, leading, producer, of, macadamia, nuts, with, 54, 000, tonnes, out, of, global, production, of, 211, 000, tonnes, macadamia, is, commercially, produced, in, many, countries, of, southeast, asia, south, america, australia, and, north, america, having, mediterranean, temperate, or, tropical, climates, the, first, commercial, orchard, of, macadamia, trees, was, planted, in, the, early, 1880s, by, rous, mill, 12, km, 7, 5, mi, southeast, of, lismore, new, south, wales, consisting, of, m, tetraphylla, besides, the, development, of, a, small, boutique, industry, in, australia, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, macadamia, was, extensively, planted, as, a, commercial, crop, in, hawaii, from, the, 1920s, onward, macadamia, seeds, were, first, imported, into, hawaii, in, 1882, by, william, h, purvis, who, planted, seeds, that, year, at, kapulena, the, hawaiian, produced, macadamia, established, the, well, known, seed, internationally, and, in, 2017, hawaii, produced, over, 22, 000, tonnes, in, 2019, researchers, collected, samples, from, hundreds, of, trees, in, queensland, and, compared, their, genetic, profiles, to, samples, from, hawaiian, orchards, they, determined, that, essentially, all, the, hawaiian, trees, must, have, descended, from, a, small, population, of, australian, trees, from, gympie, possibly, just, a, single, tree, this, lack, of, genetic, diversity, in, the, commercial, crop, puts, it, at, risk, of, succumbing, to, pathogens, as, has, happened, in, the, past, to, banana, cultivars, growers, may, seek, to, diversify, the, cultivated, population, by, hybridizing, with, wild, specimens, raw, macadamia, nuts, are, 1, water, 14, carbohydrates, 76, fat, and, 8, protein, a, 100, gram, reference, amount, of, macadamia, nuts, provides, 740, kilocalories, and, are, a, rich, source, 20, or, more, of, the, daily, value, dv, of, numerous, essential, nutrients, including, thiamine, 104, dv, vitamin, b, 6, 21, dv, other, b, vitamins, manganese, 195, dv, iron, 28, dv, magnesium, 37, dv, and, phosphorus, 27, dv, table, compared, with, other, common, edible, nuts, such, as, almonds, and, cashews, macadamias, are, high, in, total, fat, and, relatively, low, in, protein, they, have, a, high, amount, of, monounsaturated, fats, 59, of, total, content, and, contain, as, 17, of, total, fat, the, monounsaturated, fat, omega, 7, palmitoleic, acid, macadamia, allergy, is, a, type, of, food, allergy, to, macadamia, nuts, which, is, relatively, rare, affecting, less, than, 5, of, people, with, tree, nut, allergy, in, the, united, states, macadamia, allergy, can, cause, mild, to, severe, allergic, reactions, such, as, oral, allergy, syndrome, urticaria, angioedema, vomiting, abdominal, pain, asthma, and, anaphylaxis, macadamia, allergy, can, also, cross, react, with, other, tree, nuts, or, foods, that, have, similar, allergenic, proteins, such, as, coconut, walnut, hazelnut, and, cashew, the, diagnosis, and, management, of, macadamia, allergy, involves, avoiding, macadamia, nuts, and, their, derivatives, reading, food, labels, carefully, carrying, an, epinephrine, auto, injector, in, case, of, severe, reactions, and, consulting, a, doctor, for, further, testing, and, advice, macadamias, are, toxic, to, dogs, ingestion, may, result, in, macadamia, toxicity, marked, by, weakness, and, hind, limb, paralysis, with, the, inability, to, stand, occurring, within, 12, hours, of, ingestion, it, is, not, known, what, makes, macadamia, nuts, toxic, but, its, effects, have, only, been, reported, in, dogs, depending, on, the, quantity, ingested, and, the, size, of, the, dog, symptoms, may, also, include, muscle, tremors, joint, pain, and, severe, abdominal, pain, in, high, doses, of, toxin, opiate, medication, may, be, required, for, symptom, relief, until, the, toxic, effects, diminish, with, full, recovery, usually, within, 24, to, 48, hours, macadamias, are, also, toxic, to, cats, causing, tremor, paralysis, stiffness, in, joints, and, high, fever, the, trees, are, also, grown, as, ornamental, plants, in, subtropical, regions, for, their, glossy, foliage, and, attractive, flowers, the, flowers, produce, a, well, regarded, honey, the, wood, is, used, decoratively, for, small, items, macadamia, species, are, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, species, including, batrachedra, arenosella, macadamia, seeds, are, often, fed, to, hyacinth, macaws, in, captivity, these, large, parrots, are, one, of, the, few, animals, aside, from, humans, capable, of, cracking, the, shell, and, removing, the, seed
