17, 19, see, text, the, peregrine, falcon, falco, peregrinus, also, known, simply, as, the, peregrine, and, historically, as, the, duck, hawk, in, north, america, is, a, cosmopolitan, bird, of, prey, raptor, in, the, family, falconidae, a, large, crow, sized, falcon, it, has, a, blue, grey, back, barred, white, underparts, and, a, black, head, the, peregrine, is, renowned, for, its, speed, it, can, reach, over, 320, km, h, 200, mph, during, its, characteristic, hunting, stoop, high, speed, dive, making, it, the, fastest, animal, on, the, planet, according, to, a, national, geographic, tv, program, the, highest, measured, speed, of, a, peregrine, falcon, is, 389, km, h, 242, mph, as, is, typical, for, bird, eating, avivore, raptors, peregrine, falcons, are, sexually, dimorphic, with, females, being, considerably, larger, than, males, the, peregrine, s, breeding, range, includes, land, regions, from, the, arctic, tundra, to, the, tropics, it, can, be, found, nearly, everywhere, on, earth, except, extreme, polar, regions, very, high, mountains, and, most, tropical, rainforests, the, only, major, ice, free, landmass, from, which, it, is, entirely, absent, is, new, zealand, this, makes, it, the, world, s, most, widespread, raptor, and, one, of, the, most, widely, found, wild, bird, species, in, fact, the, only, land, based, bird, species, found, over, a, larger, geographic, area, owes, its, success, to, human, led, introduction, the, domestic, and, feral, pigeons, are, both, domesticate, forms, of, the, rock, dove, which, are, a, major, prey, species, for, eurasian, peregrine, populations, due, to, their, prevalence, over, most, other, bird, species, in, cities, feral, pigeons, support, many, peregrine, populations, as, a, staple, food, source, especially, in, urban, settings, the, peregrine, is, a, highly, successful, example, of, urban, wildlife, in, much, of, its, range, taking, advantage, of, tall, buildings, as, nest, sites, and, an, abundance, of, prey, such, as, pigeons, and, ducks, both, the, english, and, scientific, names, of, this, species, mean, wandering, falcon, referring, to, the, migratory, habits, of, many, northern, populations, experts, recognize, 17, to, 19, subspecies, which, vary, in, appearance, and, range, disagreement, exists, over, whether, the, distinctive, barbary, falcon, is, represented, by, two, subspecies, of, falco, peregrinus, or, is, a, separate, species, f, pelegrinoides, the, two, species, divergence, is, relatively, recent, during, the, time, of, the, last, ice, age, therefore, the, genetic, differential, between, them, and, also, the, difference, in, their, appearance, is, relatively, tiny, they, are, only, about, 0, 6, 0, 8, genetically, differentiated, although, its, diet, consists, almost, exclusively, of, medium, sized, birds, the, peregrine, will, sometimes, hunt, small, mammals, small, reptiles, or, even, insects, reaching, sexual, maturity, at, one, year, it, mates, for, life, and, nests, in, a, scrape, normally, on, cliff, edges, or, in, recent, times, on, tall, human, made, structures, the, peregrine, falcon, became, an, endangered, species, in, many, areas, because, of, the, widespread, use, of, certain, pesticides, especially, ddt, since, the, ban, on, ddt, from, the, early, 1970s, populations, have, recovered, supported, by, large, scale, protection, of, nesting, places, and, releases, to, the, wild, the, peregrine, falcon, is, a, well, respected, falconry, bird, due, to, its, strong, hunting, ability, high, trainability, versatility, and, availability, via, captive, breeding, it, is, effective, on, most, game, bird, species, from, small, to, large, it, has, also, been, used, as, a, religious, royal, or, national, symbol, across, multiple, eras, and, areas, of, human, civilization, the, peregrine, falcon, has, a, body, length, of, 34, to, 58, cm, 13, 23, in, and, a, wingspan, from, 74, to, 120, cm, 29, 47, in, the, male, and, female, have, similar, markings, and, plumage, but, as, with, many, birds, of, prey, the, peregrine, falcon, displays, marked, sexual, dimorphism, in, size, with, the, female, measuring, up, to, 30, larger, than, the, male, males, weigh, 330, to, 1, 000, g, 12, 35, oz, and, the, noticeably, larger, females, weigh, 700, to, 1, 500, g, 25, 53, oz, in, most, subspecies, males, weigh, less, than, 700, g, 25, oz, and, females, weigh, more, than, 800, g, 28, oz, and, cases, of, females, weighing, about, 50, more, than, their, male, breeding, mates, are, not, uncommon, the, standard, linear, measurements, of, peregrines, are, the, wing, chord, measures, 26, 5, to, 39, cm, 10, 4, 15, 4, in, the, tail, measures, 13, to, 19, cm, 5, 1, 7, 5, in, and, the, tarsus, measures, 4, 5, to, 5, 6, cm, 1, 8, 2, 2, in, the, back, and, the, long, pointed, wings, of, the, adult, are, usually, bluish, black, to, slate, grey, with, indistinct, darker, barring, see, subspecies, below, the, wingtips, are, black, the, white, to, rusty, underparts, are, barred, with, thin, clean, bands, of, dark, brown, or, black, the, tail, coloured, like, the, back, but, with, thin, clean, bars, is, long, narrow, and, rounded, at, the, end, with, a, black, tip, and, a, white, band, at, the, very, end, the, top, of, the, head, and, a, moustache, along, the, cheeks, are, black, contrasting, sharply, with, the, pale, sides, of, the, neck, and, white, throat, the, cere, is, yellow, as, are, the, feet, and, the, beak, and, claws, are, black, the, upper, beak, is, notched, near, the, tip, an, adaptation, which, enables, falcons, to, kill, prey, by, severing, the, spinal, column, at, the, neck, an, immature, bird, is, much, browner, with, streaked, rather, than, barred, underparts, and, has, a, pale, bluish, cere, and, orbital, ring, a, study, shows, that, their, black, malar, stripe, exists, to, reduce, glare, from, solar, radiation, allowing, them, to, see, better, photos, from, the, macaulay, library, and, inaturalist, showed, that, the, malar, stripe, is, thicker, where, there, is, more, solar, radiation, that, supports, the, solar, glare, hypothesis, falco, peregrinus, was, first, described, under, its, current, binomial, name, by, english, ornithologist, marmaduke, tunstall, in, his, 1771, work, ornithologia, britannica, the, scientific, name, falco, peregrinus, is, a, medieval, latin, phrase, that, was, used, by, albertus, magnus, in, 1225, peregrinus, is, latin, meaning, one, from, abroad, or, coming, from, foreign, parts, it, is, likely, the, name, was, used, as, juvenile, birds, were, taken, while, journeying, to, their, breeding, location, rather, than, from, the, nest, as, falcon, nests, are, often, difficult, to, get, at, the, latin, term, for, falcon, falco, is, related, to, falx, meaning, sickle, in, reference, to, the, silhouette, of, the, falcon, s, long, pointed, wings, in, flight, the, peregrine, falcon, belongs, to, a, genus, whose, lineage, includes, the, hierofalcons, and, the, prairie, falcon, f, mexicanus, this, lineage, probably, diverged, from, other, falcons, towards, the, end, of, the, late, miocene, or, in, the, late, pliocene, about, 3, 8, million, years, ago, mya, as, the, peregrine, hierofalcon, group, includes, both, old, world, and, north, american, species, it, is, likely, that, the, lineage, originated, in, western, eurasia, or, africa, its, relationship, to, other, falcons, is, not, clear, as, the, issue, is, complicated, by, widespread, hybridization, confounding, mtdna, sequence, analyses, one, genetic, lineage, of, the, saker, falcon, f, cherrug, is, known, to, have, originated, from, a, male, saker, ancestor, producing, fertile, young, with, a, female, peregrine, ancestor, and, the, descendants, further, breeding, with, sakers, today, peregrines, are, regularly, paired, in, captivity, with, other, species, such, as, the, lanner, falcon, f, biarmicus, to, produce, the, perilanner, a, bird, popular, in, falconry, as, it, combines, the, peregrine, s, hunting, skill, with, the, lanner, s, hardiness, or, the, gyrfalcon, to, produce, large, strikingly, coloured, birds, for, the, use, of, falconers, numerous, subspecies, of, falco, peregrinus, have, been, described, with, 19, accepted, by, the, 1994, handbook, of, the, birds, of, the, world, which, considers, the, barbary, falcon, of, the, canary, islands, and, coastal, north, africa, to, be, two, subspecies, pelegrinoides, and, babylonicus, of, falco, peregrinus, rather, than, a, distinct, species, f, pelegrinoides, the, following, map, shows, the, general, ranges, of, these, 19, subspecies, the, barbary, falcon, is, a, subspecies, of, the, peregrine, falcon, that, inhabits, parts, of, north, africa, namely, from, the, canary, islands, to, the, arabian, peninsula, there, is, discussion, concerning, the, taxonomic, status, of, the, bird, with, some, considering, it, a, subspecies, of, the, peregrine, falcon, and, others, considering, it, a, full, species, with, two, subspecies, white, et, al, 2013, compared, to, the, other, peregrine, falcon, subspecies, barbary, falcons, sport, a, slimmer, body, and, a, distinct, plumage, color, pattern, despite, numbers, and, range, of, these, birds, throughout, the, canary, islands, generally, increasing, they, are, considered, endangered, with, human, interference, through, falconry, and, shooting, threatening, their, well, being, falconry, can, further, complicate, the, speciation, and, genetics, of, these, canary, islands, falcons, as, the, practice, promotes, genetic, mixing, between, individuals, from, outside, the, islands, with, those, originating, from, the, islands, population, density, of, the, barbary, falcons, on, tenerife, the, biggest, of, the, seven, major, canary, islands, was, found, to, be, 1, 27, pairs, 100, km, 2, with, the, mean, distance, between, pairs, being, 5869, 3338, m, the, falcons, were, only, observed, near, large, and, natural, cliffs, with, a, mean, altitude, of, 697, 6, m, falcons, show, an, affinity, for, tall, cliffs, away, from, human, mediated, establishments, and, presence, barbary, falcons, have, a, red, neck, patch, but, otherwise, differ, in, appearance, from, the, peregrine, falcon, proper, merely, according, to, gloger, s, rule, relating, pigmentation, to, environmental, humidity, the, barbary, falcon, has, a, peculiar, way, of, flying, beating, only, the, outer, part, of, its, wings, as, fulmars, sometimes, do, this, also, occurs, in, the, peregrine, falcon, but, less, often, and, far, less, pronounced, the, barbary, falcon, s, shoulder, and, pelvis, bones, are, stout, by, comparison, with, the, peregrine, falcon, and, its, feet, are, smaller, barbary, falcons, breed, at, different, times, of, year, than, neighboring, peregrine, falcon, subspecies, but, they, are, capable, of, interbreeding, there, is, a, 0, 6, 0, 7, genetic, distance, in, the, peregrine, falcon, barbary, falcon, peregrinoid, complex, the, peregrine, falcon, lives, mostly, along, mountain, ranges, river, valleys, coastlines, and, increasingly, in, cities, in, mild, winter, regions, it, is, usually, a, permanent, resident, and, some, individuals, especially, adult, males, will, remain, on, the, breeding, territory, only, populations, that, breed, in, arctic, climates, typically, migrate, great, distances, during, the, northern, winter, the, peregrine, falcon, reaches, faster, speeds, than, any, other, animal, on, the, planet, when, performing, the, stoop, which, involves, soaring, to, a, great, height, and, then, diving, steeply, at, speeds, of, over, 320, km, h, 200, mph, hitting, one, wing, of, its, prey, so, as, not, to, harm, itself, on, impact, the, air, pressure, from, such, a, dive, could, possibly, damage, a, bird, s, lungs, but, small, bony, tubercles, on, a, falcon, s, nostrils, are, theorized, to, guide, the, powerful, airflow, away, from, the, nostrils, enabling, the, bird, to, breathe, more, easily, while, diving, by, reducing, the, change, in, air, pressure, to, protect, their, eyes, the, falcons, use, their, nictitating, membranes, third, eyelids, to, spread, tears, and, clear, debris, from, their, eyes, while, maintaining, vision, the, distinctive, malar, stripe, or, moustache, a, dark, area, of, feathers, below, the, eyes, is, thought, to, reduce, solar, glare, and, improve, contrast, sensitivity, when, targeting, fast, moving, prey, in, bright, light, condition, the, malar, stripe, has, been, found, to, be, wider, and, more, pronounced, in, regions, of, the, world, with, greater, solar, radiation, supporting, this, solar, glare, hypothesis, peregrine, falcons, have, a, flicker, fusion, frequency, of, 129, hz, cycles, per, second, very, fast, for, a, bird, of, its, size, and, much, faster, than, mammals, a, study, testing, the, flight, physics, of, an, ideal, falcon, found, a, theoretical, speed, limit, at, 400, km, h, 250, mph, for, low, altitude, flight, and, 625, km, h, 388, mph, for, high, altitude, flight, in, 2005, ken, franklin, recorded, a, falcon, stooping, at, a, top, speed, of, 389, km, h, 242, mph, the, life, span, of, peregrine, falcons, in, the, wild, is, up, to, 19, years, 9, months, mortality, in, the, first, year, is, 59, 70, declining, to, 25, 32, annually, in, adults, apart, from, such, anthropogenic, threats, as, collision, with, human, made, objects, the, peregrine, may, be, killed, by, larger, hawks, and, owls, the, peregrine, falcon, is, host, to, a, range, of, parasites, and, pathogens, it, is, a, vector, for, avipoxvirus, newcastle, disease, virus, falconid, herpesvirus, 1, and, possibly, other, herpesviridae, and, some, mycoses, and, bacterial, infections, endoparasites, include, plasmodium, relictum, usually, not, causing, malaria, in, the, peregrine, falcon, strigeidae, trematodes, serratospiculum, amaculata, nematode, and, tapeworms, known, peregrine, falcon, ectoparasites, are, chewing, lice, ceratophyllus, garei, a, flea, and, hippoboscidae, flies, icosta, nigra, ornithoctona, erythrocephala, the, peregrine, falcon, s, diet, varies, greatly, and, is, adapted, to, available, prey, in, different, regions, however, it, typically, feeds, on, medium, sized, birds, such, as, pigeons, and, doves, waterfowl, gamebirds, songbirds, parrots, seabirds, and, waders, worldwide, it, is, estimated, that, between, 1, 500, and, 2, 000, bird, species, or, roughly, a, fifth, of, the, world, s, bird, species, are, predated, somewhere, by, these, falcons, the, peregrine, falcon, preys, on, the, most, diverse, range, of, bird, species, of, any, raptor, in, north, america, with, over, 300, species, and, including, nearly, 100, shorebirds, its, prey, can, range, from, 3, g, 0, 11, oz, hummingbirds, selasphorus, and, archilochus, ssp, to, the, 3, 1, kg, 6, 8, lb, sandhill, crane, although, most, prey, taken, by, peregrines, weigh, between, 20, g, 0, 71, oz, small, passerines, and, 1, 100, g, 2, 4, lb, ducks, geese, loons, gulls, capercaillies, ptarmigans, and, other, grouse, smaller, hawks, such, as, sharp, shinned, hawks, and, owls, are, regularly, predated, as, well, as, smaller, falcons, such, as, the, american, kestrel, merlin, and, rarely, other, peregrines, in, urban, areas, where, it, tends, to, nest, on, tall, buildings, or, bridges, it, subsists, mostly, on, a, variety, of, pigeons, among, pigeons, the, rock, dove, or, feral, pigeon, comprises, 80, or, more, of, the, dietary, intake, of, peregrines, other, common, city, birds, are, also, taken, regularly, including, mourning, doves, common, wood, pigeons, common, swifts, northern, flickers, eurasian, collared, doves, common, starlings, american, robins, common, blackbirds, and, corvids, such, as, magpies, jays, or, carrion, house, and, american, crows, coastal, populations, of, the, large, subspecies, pealei, feed, almost, exclusively, on, seabirds, in, the, brazilian, mangrove, swamp, of, cubat, o, a, wintering, falcon, of, the, subspecies, tundrius, was, observed, successfully, hunting, a, juvenile, scarlet, ibis, among, mammalian, prey, species, bats, in, the, genera, eptesicus, myotis, pipistrellus, and, tadarida, are, the, most, common, prey, taken, at, night, though, peregrines, generally, do, not, prefer, terrestrial, mammalian, prey, in, rankin, inlet, peregrines, largely, take, northern, collared, lemmings, dicrostonyx, groenlandicus, along, with, a, few, arctic, ground, squirrels, urocitellus, parryii, other, small, mammals, including, shrews, mice, rats, voles, and, squirrels, are, more, seldom, taken, peregrines, occasionally, take, rabbits, mainly, young, individuals, and, juvenile, hares, additionally, remains, of, red, fox, kits, and, adult, female, american, marten, were, found, among, prey, remains, insects, and, reptiles, such, as, small, snakes, make, up, a, small, proportion, of, the, diet, and, salmonid, fish, have, been, taken, by, peregrines, the, peregrine, falcon, hunts, most, often, at, dawn, and, dusk, when, prey, are, most, active, but, also, nocturnally, in, cities, particularly, during, migration, periods, when, hunting, at, night, may, become, prevalent, nocturnal, migrants, taken, by, peregrines, include, species, as, diverse, as, yellow, billed, cuckoo, black, necked, grebe, virginia, rail, and, common, quail, the, peregrine, requires, open, space, in, order, to, hunt, and, therefore, often, hunts, over, open, water, marshes, valleys, fields, and, tundra, searching, for, prey, either, from, a, high, perch, or, from, the, air, large, congregations, of, migrants, especially, species, that, gather, in, the, open, like, shorebirds, can, be, quite, attractive, to, a, hunting, peregrine, once, prey, is, spotted, it, begins, its, stoop, folding, back, the, tail, and, wings, with, feet, tucked, prey, is, typically, struck, and, captured, in, mid, air, the, peregrine, falcon, strikes, its, prey, with, a, clenched, foot, stunning, or, killing, it, with, the, impact, then, turns, to, catch, it, in, mid, air, if, its, prey, is, too, heavy, to, carry, a, peregrine, will, drop, it, to, the, ground, and, eat, it, there, if, they, miss, the, initial, strike, peregrines, will, chase, their, prey, in, a, twisting, flight, although, previously, thought, rare, several, cases, of, peregrines, contour, hunting, i, e, using, natural, contours, to, surprise, and, ambush, prey, on, the, ground, have, been, reported, and, even, rare, cases, of, prey, being, pursued, on, foot, in, addition, peregrines, have, been, documented, preying, on, chicks, in, nests, from, birds, such, as, kittiwakes, prey, is, plucked, before, consumption, a, 2016, study, showed, that, the, presence, of, peregrines, benefits, non, preferred, species, while, at, the, same, time, causing, a, decline, in, its, preferred, prey, as, of, 2018, the, fastest, recorded, falcon, was, at, 242, mph, nearly, 390, km, h, researchers, at, the, university, of, groningen, in, the, netherlands, and, at, oxford, university, used, 3d, computer, simulations, in, 2018, to, show, that, the, high, speed, allows, peregrines, to, gain, better, maneuverability, and, precision, in, strikes, the, peregrine, falcon, is, sexually, mature, at, one, to, three, years, of, age, but, in, larger, populations, they, breed, after, two, to, three, years, of, age, a, pair, mates, for, life, and, returns, to, the, same, nesting, spot, annually, the, courtship, flight, includes, a, mix, of, aerial, acrobatics, precise, spirals, and, steep, dives, the, male, passes, prey, it, has, caught, to, the, female, in, mid, air, to, make, this, possible, the, female, actually, flies, upside, down, to, receive, the, food, from, the, male, s, talons, during, the, breeding, season, the, peregrine, falcon, is, territorial, nesting, pairs, are, usually, more, than, 1, km, 0, 62, mi, apart, and, often, much, farther, even, in, areas, with, large, numbers, of, pairs, the, distance, between, nests, ensures, sufficient, food, supply, for, pairs, and, their, chicks, within, a, breeding, territory, a, pair, may, have, several, nesting, ledges, the, number, used, by, a, pair, can, vary, from, one, or, two, up, to, seven, in, a, 16, year, period, the, peregrine, falcon, nests, in, a, scrape, normally, on, cliff, edges, the, female, chooses, a, nest, site, where, she, scrapes, a, shallow, hollow, in, the, loose, soil, sand, gravel, or, dead, vegetation, in, which, to, lay, eggs, no, nest, materials, are, added, cliff, nests, are, generally, located, under, an, overhang, on, ledges, with, vegetation, south, facing, sites, are, favoured, in, some, regions, as, in, parts, of, australia, and, on, the, west, coast, of, northern, north, america, large, tree, hollows, are, used, for, nesting, before, the, demise, of, most, european, peregrines, a, large, population, of, peregrines, in, central, and, western, europe, used, the, disused, nests, of, other, large, birds, in, remote, undisturbed, areas, such, as, the, arctic, steep, slopes, and, even, low, rocks, and, mounds, may, be, used, as, nest, sites, in, many, parts, of, its, range, peregrines, now, also, nest, regularly, on, tall, buildings, or, bridges, these, human, made, structures, used, for, breeding, closely, resemble, the, natural, cliff, ledges, that, the, peregrine, prefers, for, its, nesting, locations, the, pair, defends, the, chosen, nest, site, against, other, peregrines, and, often, against, ravens, herons, and, gulls, and, if, ground, nesting, also, such, mammals, as, foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and, mountain, lions, both, nests, and, less, frequently, adults, are, predated, by, larger, bodied, raptorial, birds, like, eagles, large, owls, or, gyrfalcons, the, most, serious, predators, of, peregrine, nests, in, north, america, and, europe, are, the, great, horned, owl, and, the, eurasian, eagle, owl, when, reintroductions, have, been, attempted, for, peregrines, the, most, serious, impediments, were, these, two, species, of, owls, routinely, picking, off, nestlings, fledglings, and, adults, by, night, peregrines, defending, their, nests, have, managed, to, kill, raptors, as, large, as, golden, eagles, and, bald, eagles, both, of, which, they, normally, avoid, as, potential, predators, that, have, come, too, close, to, the, nest, by, ambushing, them, in, a, full, stoop, in, one, instance, when, a, snowy, owl, killed, a, newly, fledged, peregrine, the, larger, owl, was, in, turn, killed, by, a, stooping, peregrine, parent, the, date, of, egg, laying, varies, according, to, locality, but, is, generally, from, february, to, march, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, from, july, to, august, in, the, southern, hemisphere, although, the, australian, subspecies, macropus, may, breed, as, late, as, november, and, equatorial, populations, may, nest, anytime, between, june, and, december, if, the, eggs, are, lost, early, in, the, nesting, season, the, female, usually, lays, another, clutch, although, this, is, extremely, rare, in, the, arctic, due, to, the, short, summer, season, generally, three, to, four, eggs, but, sometimes, as, few, as, one, or, as, many, as, five, are, laid, in, the, scrape, the, eggs, are, white, to, buff, with, red, or, brown, markings, they, are, incubated, for, 29, to, 33, days, mainly, by, the, female, with, the, male, also, helping, with, the, incubation, of, the, eggs, during, the, day, but, only, the, female, incubating, them, at, night, the, average, number, of, young, found, in, nests, is, 2, 5, and, the, average, number, that, fledge, is, about, 1, 5, due, to, the, occasional, production, of, infertile, eggs, and, various, natural, losses, of, nestlings, after, hatching, the, chicks, called, eyases, are, covered, with, creamy, white, down, and, have, disproportionately, large, feet, the, male, called, the, tiercel, and, the, female, simply, called, the, falcon, both, leave, the, nest, to, gather, prey, to, feed, the, young, the, hunting, territory, of, the, parents, can, extend, a, radius, of, 19, to, 24, km, 12, to, 15, mi, from, the, nest, site, chicks, fledge, 42, to, 46, days, after, hatching, and, remain, dependent, on, their, parents, for, up, to, two, months, the, peregrine, falcon, is, a, highly, admired, falconry, bird, and, has, been, used, in, falconry, for, more, than, 3, 000, years, beginning, with, nomads, in, central, asia, its, advantages, in, falconry, include, not, only, its, athleticism, and, eagerness, to, hunt, but, an, equable, disposition, that, leads, to, it, being, one, of, the, easier, falcons, to, train, the, peregrine, falcon, has, the, additional, advantage, of, a, natural, flight, style, of, circling, above, the, falconer, waiting, on, for, game, to, be, flushed, and, then, performing, an, effective, and, exciting, high, speed, diving, stoop, to, take, the, quarry, the, speed, of, the, stoop, not, only, allows, the, falcon, to, catch, fast, flying, birds, it, also, enhances, the, falcon, s, ability, to, execute, maneuvers, to, catch, highly, agile, prey, and, allows, the, falcon, to, deliver, a, knockout, blow, with, a, fist, like, clenched, talon, against, game, that, may, be, much, larger, than, itself, additionally, the, versatility, of, the, species, with, agility, allowing, capture, of, smaller, birds, and, a, strength, and, attacking, style, allowing, capture, of, game, much, larger, than, themselves, combined, with, the, wide, size, range, of, the, many, peregrine, subspecies, means, there, is, a, subspecies, suitable, to, almost, any, size, and, type, of, game, bird, this, size, range, evolved, to, fit, various, environments, and, prey, species, is, from, the, larger, females, of, the, largest, subspecies, to, the, smaller, males, of, the, smallest, subspecies, approximately, five, to, one, approximately, 1500, g, to, 300, g, the, males, of, smaller, and, medium, sized, subspecies, and, the, females, of, the, smaller, subspecies, excel, in, the, taking, of, swift, and, agile, small, game, birds, such, as, dove, quail, and, smaller, ducks, the, females, of, the, larger, subspecies, are, capable, of, taking, large, and, powerful, game, birds, such, as, the, largest, of, duck, species, pheasant, and, grouse, peregrine, falcons, handled, by, falconers, are, also, occasionally, used, to, scare, away, birds, at, airports, to, reduce, the, risk, of, bird, plane, strikes, improving, air, traffic, safety, they, were, also, used, to, intercept, homing, pigeons, during, world, war, ii, peregrine, falcons, have, been, successfully, bred, in, captivity, both, for, falconry, and, for, release, into, the, wild, until, 2004, nearly, all, peregrines, used, for, falconry, in, the, us, were, captive, bred, from, the, progeny, of, falcons, taken, before, the, us, endangered, species, act, was, enacted, and, from, those, few, infusions, of, wild, genes, available, from, canada, and, special, circumstances, peregrine, falcons, were, removed, from, the, united, states, endangered, species, list, in, 1999, the, successful, recovery, program, was, aided, by, the, effort, and, knowledge, of, falconers, in, collaboration, with, the, peregrine, fund, and, state, and, federal, agencies, through, a, technique, called, hacking, finally, after, years, of, close, work, with, the, us, fish, and, wildlife, service, a, limited, take, of, wild, peregrines, was, allowed, in, 2004, the, first, wild, peregrines, taken, specifically, for, falconry, in, over, 30, years, the, development, of, captive, breeding, methods, has, led, to, peregrines, being, commercially, available, for, falconry, use, thus, mostly, eliminating, the, need, to, capture, wild, birds, for, support, of, falconry, the, main, reason, for, taking, wild, peregrines, at, this, point, is, to, maintain, healthy, genetic, diversity, in, the, breeding, lines, hybrids, of, peregrines, and, gyrfalcons, are, also, available, that, can, combine, the, best, features, of, both, species, to, create, what, many, consider, to, be, the, ultimate, falconry, bird, for, the, taking, of, larger, game, such, as, the, sage, grouse, these, hybrids, combine, the, greater, size, strength, and, horizontal, speed, of, the, gyrfalcon, with, the, natural, propensity, to, stoop, and, greater, warm, weather, tolerance, of, the, peregrine, the, peregrine, falcon, became, an, endangered, species, over, much, of, its, range, because, of, the, use, of, organochlorine, pesticides, especially, ddt, during, the, 1950s, 60s, and, 70s, pesticide, biomagnification, caused, organochlorine, to, build, up, in, the, falcons, fat, tissues, reducing, the, amount, of, calcium, in, their, eggshells, with, thinner, shells, fewer, falcon, eggs, survived, until, hatching, in, addition, the, pcb, concentrations, found, in, these, falcons, is, dependent, upon, the, age, of, the, falcon, while, high, levels, are, still, found, in, young, birds, only, a, few, months, old, and, even, higher, concentrations, are, found, in, more, mature, falcons, further, increasing, in, adult, peregrine, falcons, these, pesticides, caused, falcon, prey, to, also, have, thinner, eggshells, one, example, of, prey, being, the, black, petrels, in, several, parts, of, the, world, such, as, the, eastern, united, states, and, belgium, this, species, became, extirpated, locally, extinct, as, a, result, an, alternate, point, of, view, is, that, populations, in, the, eastern, north, america, had, vanished, due, to, hunting, and, egg, collection, following, the, ban, of, organochlorine, pesticides, the, reproductive, success, of, peregrines, increased, in, scotland, in, terms, of, territory, occupancy, and, breeding, success, although, spatial, variation, in, recovery, rates, indicate, that, in, some, areas, peregrines, were, also, impacted, by, other, factors, such, as, persecution, peregrine, falcon, recovery, teams, breed, the, species, in, captivity, the, chicks, are, usually, fed, through, a, chute, or, with, a, hand, puppet, mimicking, a, peregrine, s, head, so, they, cannot, see, to, imprint, on, the, human, trainers, then, when, they, are, old, enough, the, rearing, box, is, opened, allowing, the, bird, to, train, its, wings, as, the, fledgling, gets, stronger, feeding, is, reduced, forcing, the, bird, to, learn, to, hunt, this, procedure, is, called, hacking, back, to, the, wild, to, release, a, captive, bred, falcon, the, bird, is, placed, in, a, special, cage, at, the, top, of, a, tower, or, cliff, ledge, for, some, days, or, so, allowing, it, to, acclimate, itself, to, its, future, environment, worldwide, recovery, efforts, have, been, remarkably, successful, the, widespread, restriction, of, ddt, use, eventually, allowed, released, birds, to, breed, successfully, the, peregrine, falcon, was, removed, from, the, u, s, endangered, species, list, on, 25, august, 1999, some, controversy, has, existed, over, the, origins, of, captive, breeding, stock, used, by, the, peregrine, fund, in, the, recovery, of, peregrine, falcons, throughout, the, contiguous, united, states, several, peregrine, subspecies, were, included, in, the, breeding, stock, including, birds, of, eurasian, origin, due, to, the, extirpation, of, the, eastern, population, of, falco, peregrinus, anatum, the, near, extirpation, of, anatum, in, the, midwest, and, the, limited, gene, pool, within, north, american, breeding, stock, the, inclusion, of, non, native, subspecies, was, justified, to, optimize, the, genetic, diversity, found, within, the, species, as, a, whole, during, the, 1970s, peregrine, falcons, in, finland, experienced, a, population, bottleneck, as, a, result, of, large, declines, associated, with, bio, accumulation, of, organochloride, pesticides, however, the, genetic, diversity, of, peregrines, in, finland, is, similar, to, other, populations, indicating, that, high, dispersal, rates, have, maintained, the, genetic, diversity, of, this, species, since, peregrine, falcon, eggs, and, chicks, are, still, often, targeted, by, illegal, poachers, it, is, common, practice, not, to, publicize, unprotected, nest, locations, populations, of, the, peregrine, falcon, have, bounced, back, in, most, parts, of, the, world, in, the, united, kingdom, there, has, been, a, recovery, of, populations, since, the, crash, of, the, 1960s, this, has, been, greatly, assisted, by, conservation, and, protection, work, led, by, the, royal, society, for, the, protection, of, birds, the, rspb, estimated, that, there, were, 1, 402, breeding, pairs, in, the, uk, in, 2011, in, canada, where, peregrines, were, identified, as, endangered, in, 1978, in, the, yukon, territory, of, northern, canada, that, year, only, a, single, breeding, pair, was, identified, the, committee, on, the, status, of, endangered, wildlife, in, canada, declared, the, species, no, longer, at, risk, in, december, 2017, peregrines, now, breed, in, many, mountainous, and, coastal, areas, especially, in, the, west, and, north, and, nest, in, some, urban, areas, capitalising, on, the, urban, feral, pigeon, populations, for, food, additionally, falcons, benefit, from, artificial, illumination, which, allows, the, raptors, to, extend, their, hunting, periods, into, the, dusk, when, natural, illumination, would, otherwise, be, too, low, for, them, to, pursue, prey, in, england, this, has, allowed, them, to, prey, on, nocturnal, migrants, such, as, redwings, fieldfares, starlings, and, woodcocks, in, many, parts, of, the, world, peregrine, falcons, have, adapted, to, urban, habitats, nesting, on, cathedrals, skyscraper, window, ledges, tower, blocks, and, the, towers, of, suspension, bridges, many, of, these, nesting, birds, are, encouraged, sometimes, gathering, media, attention, and, often, monitored, by, cameras, in, england, peregrine, falcons, have, become, increasingly, urban, in, distribution, particularly, in, southern, areas, where, inland, cliffs, suitable, as, nesting, sites, are, scarce, the, first, recorded, urban, breeding, pair, was, observed, nesting, on, the, swansea, guildhall, in, the, 1980s, in, southampton, a, nest, prevented, restoration, of, mobile, telephony,

aggression, and, martial, prowess, the, ancient, egyptian, solar, deity, ra, was, often, represented, as, a, man, with, the, head, of, a, peregrine, falcon, adorned, with, the, solar, disk, although, most, egyptologists, agree, that, it, s, most, likely, a, lanner, falcon, native, americans, of, the, mississippian, culture, c, 800, 1500, used, the, peregrine, along, with, several, other, birds, of, prey, in, imagery, as, a, symbol, of, aerial, celestial, power, and, buried, men, of, high, status, in, costumes, associating, to, the, ferocity, of, raptorial, birds, in, the, late, middle, ages, the, western, european, nobility, that, used, peregrines, for, hunting, considered, the, bird, associated, with, princes, in, formal, hierarchies, of, birds, of, prey, just, below, the, gyrfalcon,
