asparagus, asparagus, officinalis, is, a, perennial, flowering, plant, species, in, the, genus, asparagus, native, to, eurasia, widely, cultivated, as, a, vegetable, crop, its, young, shoots, are, used, as, a, spring, vegetable, asparagus, is, an, herbaceous, perennial, plant, growing, to, 100, 150, centimetres, 3, 5, feet, tall, with, stout, stems, with, much, branched, feathery, foliage, the, leaves, are, needle, like, cladodes, modified, stems, in, the, axils, of, scale, leaves, they, are, 6, 32, millimetres, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, inches, long, and, 1, mm, 1, 32, in, broad, and, clustered, in, fours, up, to, 15, together, in, a, rose, like, shape, the, root, system, often, referred, to, as, a, crown, is, adventitious, the, root, type, is, fasciculated, the, flowers, are, bell, shaped, greenish, white, to, yellowish, 4, 5, 6, 5, mm, 3, 16, 1, 4, in, long, with, six, tepals, partially, fused, together, at, the, base, they, are, produced, singly, or, in, clusters, of, two, or, three, in, the, junctions, of, the, branchlets, it, is, usually, dioecious, with, male, and, female, flowers, on, separate, plants, but, sometimes, hermaphrodite, flowers, are, found, the, fruit, is, a, small, red, berry, 6, 10, mm, 1, 4, 13, 32, in, in, diameter, which, is, toxic, to, humans, plants, native, to, the, western, coasts, of, europe, from, northern, spain, to, northwest, germany, north, ireland, and, great, britain, are, treated, as, a, officinalis, subsp, prostratus, dumort, corb, distinguished, by, its, low, growing, often, prostrate, stems, growing, to, only, 30, 70, cm, 12, 28, in, high, and, shorter, cladodes, 2, 18, mm, 3, 32, 23, 32, in, long, some, authors, treat, it, as, a, distinct, species, a, prostratus, dumort, asparagus, was, once, classified, in, the, lily, family, as, were, the, related, allium, species, onions, and, garlic, genetic, research, currently, places, lilies, allium, and, asparagus, in, three, separate, families, the, liliaceae, amaryllidaceae, and, asparagaceae, respectively, the, latter, two, are, part, of, the, order, asparagales, the, english, word, asparagus, derives, from, classical, latin, but, the, plant, was, once, known, in, english, as, sperage, from, the, medieval, latin, sparagus, this, term, itself, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, asp, ragos, a, variant, of, ancient, greek, asph, ragos, the, greek, terms, are, of, uncertain, provenance, the, former, form, admits, the, possibility, of, a, proto, indo, european, root, meaning, to, jerk, scatter, directly, or, via, a, persian, descendant, meaning, twig, branch, but, the, ancient, greek, word, itself, meaning, gully, chasm, seems, to, be, of, pre, greek, origin, instead, in, english, a, officinalis, is, widely, known, simply, as, asparagus, or, sometimes, garden, asparagus, asparagus, was, corrupted, by, folk, etymology, in, some, places, to, sparrow, grass, indeed, john, walker, wrote, in, 1791, that, sparrowgrass, is, so, general, that, asparagus, has, an, air, of, stiffness, and, pedantry, the, name, sparrow, grass, was, still, in, common, use, in, rural, east, anglia, england, well, into, the, twentieth, century, sources, differ, as, to, the, plant, s, native, range, but, generally, include, most, of, europe, and, western, temperate, asia, since, asparagus, often, originates, in, maritime, habitats, it, thrives, in, soils, that, are, too, saline, for, normal, weeds, to, grow, thus, a, little, salt, was, traditionally, used, to, suppress, weeds, in, beds, intended, for, asparagus, this, has, the, disadvantage, that, the, soil, cannot, be, used, for, anything, else, some, regions, and, gardening, zones, are, better, suited, for, growing, asparagus, than, others, such, as, the, west, coast, of, north, america, and, other, more, maritime, mediterranean, environments, the, fertility, of, the, soil, is, a, large, factor, crowns, are, planted, in, winter, and, the, first, shoots, appear, in, spring, the, first, pickings, or, thinnings, are, known, as, sprue, asparagus, sprue, has, thin, stems, a, breed, of, early, season, asparagus, that, can, be, harvested, two, months, earlier, than, usual, was, announced, by, a, uk, grower, in, early, 2011, this, variety, does, not, need, to, lie, dormant, and, blooms, at, 7, c, 45, f, rather, than, the, usual, 9, c, 48, f, purple, asparagus, differs, from, its, green, and, white, counterparts, in, having, high, sugar, and, low, fibre, levels, purple, asparagus, was, originally, developed, in, italy, near, the, city, of, albenga, and, commercialized, under, the, variety, name, violetto, d, albenga, purple, asparagus, can, also, turn, green, while, being, cooked, due, to, its, sensitivity, to, heat, asparagus, is, said, to, be, a, useful, companion, plant, for, tomatoes, as, the, tomato, plant, repels, the, asparagus, beetle, asparagus, may, repel, some, harmful, root, nematodes, that, affect, tomato, plants, the, genome, of, the, species, has, been, sequenced, as, a, model, to, study, the, evolution, of, sex, chromosomes, in, plants, and, dioecy, water, makes, up, 93, of, asparagus, s, composition, asparagus, is, low, in, food, energy, and, very, low, in, sodium, it, is, a, good, source, of, vitamin, b, 6, calcium, magnesium, and, zinc, and, a, very, good, source, of, dietary, fibre, protein, beta, carotene, vitamin, c, vitamin, e, vitamin, k, thiamin, riboflavin, rutin, niacin, folic, acid, iron, phosphorus, potassium, copper, manganese, and, selenium, as, well, as, chromium, a, trace, mineral, that, regulates, the, ability, of, insulin, to, transport, glucose, from, the, bloodstream, into, cells, the, amino, acid, asparagine, gets, its, name, from, asparagus, from, which, it, was, first, isolated, as, the, asparagus, plant, is, relatively, rich, in, this, compound, only, young, asparagus, shoots, are, commonly, eaten, once, the, buds, start, to, open, ferning, out, the, shoots, quickly, turn, woody, the, roots, contain, starch, the, shoots, are, prepared, and, served, in, a, number, of, ways, around, the, world, typically, as, an, appetizer, or, vegetable, side, dish, in, asian, style, cooking, asparagus, is, often, stir, fried, cantonese, restaurants, in, the, united, states, often, serve, asparagus, stir, fried, with, chicken, shrimp, or, beef, it, may, also, be, quickly, grilled, over, charcoal, or, hardwood, embers, and, is, also, used, as, an, ingredient, in, some, stews, and, soups, asparagus, can, also, be, pickled, and, stored, for, several, years, some, brands, label, shoots, prepared, in, this, way, as, marinated, stem, thickness, indicates, the, age, of, the, plant, and, not, the, age, of, the, stalk, with, the, thicker, stems, coming, from, older, plants, older, thicker, stalks, can, be, woody, although, peeling, the, skin, at, the, base, removes, the, tough, layer, peeled, asparagus, will, poach, much, faster, the, bottom, portion, of, asparagus, often, contains, sand, and, soil, so, thorough, cleaning, is, generally, advised, before, cooking, male, plants, tend, to, produce, spears, that, are, smaller, and, thinner, while, female, plants, tend, produce, larger, and, thicker, spears, thickness, and, thinness, are, not, an, indication, of, tenderness, or, toughness, the, stalks, are, thick, or, thin, from, the, moment, they, sprout, from, the, ground, green, asparagus, is, eaten, worldwide, and, the, availability, of, imports, throughout, the, year, has, made, it, less, of, a, delicacy, than, it, once, was, in, europe, according, to, one, source, the, asparagus, season, is, a, highlight, of, the, foodie, calendar, in, the, uk, this, traditionally, begins, on, 23, april, and, ends, on, midsummer, day, as, in, continental, europe, due, to, the, short, growing, season, and, demand, for, local, produce, asparagus, commands, a, premium, price, the, top, asparagus, importers, 2016, were, the, united, states, 214, 735, tonnes, followed, by, germany, 24, 484, tonnes, and, canada, 19, 224, tonnes, china, is, by, far, the, world, s, largest, producer, in, 2017, it, produced, 7, 845, 162, tonnes, followed, by, peru, with, 383, 098, tonnes, and, mexico, with, 245, 681, tonnes, u, s, production, was, concentrated, in, california, michigan, and, washington, the, annual, production, for, white, asparagus, in, germany, is, 57, 000, tonnes, 61, of, consumer, demand, when, grown, under, tunnels, growers, can, extend, the, harvest, season, in, the, uk, it, is, estimated, that, the, asparagus, harvest, season, can, begin, as, early, as, mid, february, and, continue, into, late, autumn, by, growing, cold, resistant, cultivars, under, heated, polytunnels, furthermore, late, season, harvests, can, be, achieved, using, reverse, season, growth, where, spears, are, left, to, fern, between, march, august, and, harvested, in, september, october, in, asia, an, alternative, approach, to, cultivating, asparagus, has, been, employed, and, is, referred, to, as, mother, stalk, method, where, three, to, five, stalks, per, plant, are, allowed, to, develop, into, fern, while, harvesting, adjacent, spears, white, asparagus, is, very, popular, in, europe, and, western, asia, white, asparagus, is, the, result, of, applying, a, blanching, technique, while, the, asparagus, shoots, are, growing, to, cultivate, white, asparagus, the, shoots, are, covered, with, soil, as, they, grow, i, e, earthed, up, without, exposure, to, sunlight, no, photosynthesis, starts, and, the, shoots, remain, white, compared, to, green, asparagus, the, locally, cultivated, so, called, white, gold, or, edible, ivory, asparagus, also, referred, to, as, the, royal, vegetable, is, believed, to, be, less, bitter, and, much, more, tender, freshness, is, very, important, and, the, lower, ends, of, white, asparagus, must, be, peeled, before, cooking, or, raw, consumption, only, seasonally, on, the, menu, asparagus, dishes, are, advertised, outside, many, restaurants, usually, from, late, april, to, june, for, the, french, style, asparagus, is, often, boiled, or, steamed, and, served, with, hollandaise, sauce, white, sauce, melted, butter, or, most, recently, with, olive, oil, and, parmesan, cheese, tall, narrow, asparagus, cooking, pots, allow, the, shoots, to, be, steamed, gently, their, tips, staying, out, of, the, water, during, the, german, spargelsaison, or, spargelzeit, asparagus, season, or, asparagus, time, the, asparagus, season, that, traditionally, finishes, on, 24, june, roadside, stands, and, open, air, markets, sell, about, half, of, the, country, s, white, asparagus, consumption, in, western, himalayan, regions, such, as, nepal, and, north, western, india, wild, asparagus, is, harvested, as, a, seasonal, vegetable, delicacy, known, as, kurilo, or, jhijhirkani, asparagus, has, been, used, as, a, vegetable, owing, to, its, distinct, flavor, and, in, medicine, due, to, its, diuretic, properties, and, its, purported, function, as, an, aphrodisiac, it, is, pictured, as, an, offering, on, an, egyptian, frieze, dating, to, 3000, bc, in, ancient, times, it, was, also, known, in, syria, and, in, the, iberian, peninsula, greeks, and, romans, ate, it, fresh, when, in, season, and, dried, the, vegetable, for, use, in, winter, emperor, augustus, coined, the, expression, faster, than, cooking, asparagus, for, quick, action, a, recipe, for, cooking, asparagus, is, given, in, one, of, the, oldest, surviving, collections, of, recipes, apicius, s, 1st, century, ad, de, re, coquinaria, book, iii, in, the, second, century, ad, the, greek, physician, galen, highly, respected, within, roman, society, mentioned, asparagus, as, a, beneficial, herb, but, as, dominance, of, the, roman, empire, waned, asparagus, medicinal, value, drew, little, attention, until, al, nafzawi, s, the, perfumed, garden, that, piece, of, writing, celebrates, its, purported, aphrodisiacal, power, that, the, indian, ananga, ranga, attributes, to, special, phosphorus, elements, that, also, counteract, fatigue, by, 1469, asparagus, was, cultivated, in, french, monasteries, asparagus, appears, to, have, been, little, noticed, in, england, until, 1538, and, in, germany, until, 1542, asparagus, was, brought, to, north, america, by, european, settlers, at, least, as, early, as, 1655, adriaen, van, der, donck, a, dutch, immigrant, to, new, netherland, mentions, asparagus, in, his, description, of, dutch, farming, practices, in, the, new, world, asparagus, was, grown, by, british, immigrants, as, well, in, 1685, one, of, william, penn, s, advertisements, for, pennsylvania, included, asparagus, in, a, long, list, of, crops, that, grew, well, in, the, american, climate, the, points, d, amour, love, tips, were, served, as, a, delicacy, to, madame, de, pompadour, 1721, 1764, the, effect, of, eating, asparagus, on, urine, excreted, afterwards, has, long, been, observed, cause, a, powerful, and, disagreeable, smell, in, the, urine, as, everybody, knows, asparagus, affects, the, urine, with, a, foetid, smell, especially, if, cut, when, they, are, white, and, therefore, have, been, suspected, by, some, physicians, as, not, friendly, to, the, kidneys, when, they, are, older, and, begin, to, ramify, they, lose, this, quality, but, then, they, are, not, so, agreeable, a, few, stems, of, asparagus, eaten, shall, give, our, urine, a, disagreeable, odour, asparagus, transforms, my, chamber, pot, into, a, flask, of, perfume, asparagus, contains, asparagusic, acid, when, the, vegetable, is, digested, a, group, of, volatile, sulfur, containing, compounds, is, produced, certain, compounds, in, asparagus, are, metabolized, to, yield, ammonia, and, various, sulfur, containing, degradation, products, including, various, thiols, and, thioesters, which, following, consumption, give, urine, a, characteristic, smell, some, of, the, volatile, organic, compounds, responsible, for, the, smell, are, subjectively, the, first, two, are, the, most, pungent, while, the, last, two, sulfur, oxidized, give, a, sweet, aroma, a, mixture, of, these, compounds, form, a, reconstituted, asparagus, urine, odor, this, was, first, investigated, in, 1891, by, marceli, nencki, who, attributed, the, smell, to, methanethiol, these, compounds, originate, in, the, asparagus, as, asparagusic, acid, and, its, derivatives, as, these, are, the, only, sulfur, containing, compounds, unique, to, asparagus, as, these, are, more, present, in, young, asparagus, this, accords, with, the, observation, that, the, smell, is, more, pronounced, after, eating, young, asparagus, the, biological, mechanism, for, the, production, of, these, compounds, is, less, clear, the, onset, of, the, asparagus, urine, smell, is, remarkably, rapid, while, the, decline, is, slower, the, smell, has, been, reported, to, be, detectable, 15, to, 30, minutes, after, ingestion, and, subsides, with, a, half, life, of, approximately, four, hours, asparagus, has, been, eaten, and, cultivated, for, at, least, two, millennia, but, the, association, between, odorous, urine, and, asparagus, consumption, was, not, observed, until, the, late, 17th, century, when, sulfur, rich, fertilisers, became, common, in, agriculture, small, scale, studies, noted, that, the, asparagus, urine, odour, was, not, produced, by, all, individuals, and, estimates, as, to, the, proportion, of, the, population, who, are, excretors, reporting, a, noticeable, asparagus, urine, odour, after, eating, asparagus, has, ranged, from, about, 40, to, as, high, as, 79, when, excretors, are, exposed, to, non, excretor, urine, after, asparagus, consumption, however, the, characteristic, asparagus, urine, odour, is, usually, reported, more, recent, work, has, confirmed, that, a, small, proportion, of, individuals, do, not, produce, asparagus, urine, and, amongst, those, that, do, some, cannot, detect, the, odour, due, to, a, single, nucleotide, polymorphism, within, a, cluster, of, olfactory, receptors, debate, exists, about, the, universality, of, producing, the, sulfurous, smell, as, well, as, the, ability, to, detect, it, originally, this, was, thought, to, be, because, some, people, digested, asparagus, differently, from, others, so, some, excreted, odorous, urine, after, eating, asparagus, and, others, did, not, in, the, 1980s, three, studies, from, france, china, and, israel, published, results, showing, that, producing, odorous, urine, from, asparagus, was, a, common, human, characteristic, the, israeli, study, found, that, from, their, 307, subjects, all, of, those, who, could, smell, asparagus, urine, could, detect, it, in, the, urine, of, anyone, who, had, eaten, asparagus, even, if, the, person, who, produced, it, could, not, detect, it, a, 2010, study, found, variations, in, both, production, of, odorous, urine, and, the, ability, to, detect, the, odor, but, that, these, were, not, tightly, related, most, people, are, thought, to, produce, the, odorous, compounds, after, eating, asparagus, but, the, differing, abilities, of, various, individuals, to, detect, the, odor, at, increasing, dilutions, suggests, a, genetically, determined, specific, sensitivity, in, 2010, the, company, 23andme, published, a, genome, wide, association, study, on, whether, participants, have, ever, noticed, a, peculiar, odor, when, pee, after, eating, asparagus, this, study, pinpointed, a, single, nucleotide, polymorphism, snp, in, a, cluster, of, olfactory, genes, associated, with, the, ability, to, detect, the, odor, while, this, snp, did, not, explain, all, of, the, difference, in, detection, between, people, it, provides, support, for, the, theory, that, genetic, differences, occur, in, olfactory, receptors, that, lead, people, to, be, unable, to, smell, these, odorous, compounds, the, green, crop, is, significant, enough, in, california, s, sacramento, san, joaquin, river, delta, region, that, the, city, of, stockton, holds, a, festival, every, year, to, celebrate, it, oceana, county, michigan, the, self, proclaimed, asparagus, capital, of, the, world, hosts, an, annual, festival, complete, with, a, parade, and, asparagus, queen, the,
