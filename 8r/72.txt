the, liver, is, a, major, metabolic, organ, exclusively, found, in, vertebrate, animals, which, performs, many, essential, biological, functions, such, as, detoxification, of, the, organism, and, the, synthesis, of, proteins, and, various, other, biochemicals, necessary, for, digestion, and, growth, in, humans, it, is, located, in, the, right, upper, quadrant, of, the, abdomen, below, the, diaphragm, and, mostly, shielded, by, the, lower, right, rib, cage, its, other, metabolic, roles, include, carbohydrate, metabolism, the, production, of, hormones, conversion, and, storage, of, nutrients, such, as, glucose, and, glycogen, and, the, decomposition, of, red, blood, cells, the, liver, is, also, an, accessory, digestive, organ, that, produces, bile, an, alkaline, fluid, containing, cholesterol, and, bile, acids, which, emulsifies, and, aids, the, breakdown, of, dietary, fat, the, gallbladder, a, small, hollow, pouch, that, sits, just, under, the, right, lobe, of, liver, stores, and, concentrates, the, bile, produced, by, the, liver, which, is, later, excreted, to, the, duodenum, to, help, with, digestion, the, liver, s, highly, specialized, tissue, consisting, mostly, of, hepatocytes, regulates, a, wide, variety, of, high, volume, biochemical, reactions, including, the, synthesis, and, breakdown, of, small, and, complex, organic, molecules, many, of, which, are, necessary, for, normal, vital, functions, estimates, regarding, the, organ, s, total, number, of, functions, vary, but, is, generally, cited, as, being, around, 500, for, this, reason, the, liver, has, sometimes, been, described, as, the, body, s, chemical, factory, it, is, not, known, how, to, compensate, for, the, absence, of, liver, function, in, the, long, term, although, liver, dialysis, techniques, can, be, used, in, the, short, term, artificial, livers, have, not, been, developed, to, promote, long, term, replacement, in, the, absence, of, the, liver, as, of, 2018, liver, transplantation, is, the, only, option, for, complete, liver, failure, the, liver, is, a, dark, reddish, brown, wedge, shaped, organ, with, two, lobes, of, unequal, size, and, shape, a, human, liver, normally, weighs, approximately, 1, 5, kilograms, 3, 3, pounds, and, has, a, width, of, about, 15, centimetres, 6, inches, there, is, considerable, size, variation, between, individuals, with, the, standard, reference, range, for, men, being, 970, 1, 860, grams, 2, 14, 4, 10, lb, and, for, women, 600, 1, 770, g, 1, 32, 3, 90, lb, it, is, both, the, heaviest, internal, organ, and, the, largest, gland, in, the, human, body, it, is, located, in, the, right, upper, quadrant, of, the, abdominal, cavity, resting, just, below, the, diaphragm, to, the, right, of, the, stomach, and, overlying, the, gallbladder, the, liver, is, connected, to, two, large, blood, vessels, the, hepatic, artery, and, the, portal, vein, the, hepatic, artery, carries, oxygen, rich, blood, from, the, aorta, via, the, celiac, trunk, whereas, the, portal, vein, carries, blood, rich, in, digested, nutrients, from, the, entire, gastrointestinal, tract, and, also, from, the, spleen, and, pancreas, these, blood, vessels, subdivide, into, small, capillaries, known, as, liver, sinusoids, which, then, lead, to, hepatic, lobules, hepatic, lobules, are, the, functional, units, of, the, liver, each, lobule, is, made, up, of, millions, of, hepatic, cells, hepatocytes, which, are, the, basic, metabolic, cells, the, lobules, are, held, together, by, a, fine, dense, irregular, fibroelastic, connective, tissue, layer, extending, from, the, fibrous, capsule, covering, the, entire, liver, known, as, glisson, s, capsule, after, british, doctor, francis, glisson, this, tissue, extends, into, the, structure, of, the, liver, by, accompanying, the, blood, vessels, ducts, and, nerves, at, the, hepatic, hilum, the, whole, surface, of, the, liver, except, for, the, bare, area, is, covered, in, a, serous, coat, derived, from, the, peritoneum, and, this, firmly, adheres, to, the, inner, glisson, s, capsule, terminology, related, to, the, liver, often, starts, in, hepat, from, from, the, greek, word, for, liver, the, liver, is, grossly, divided, into, two, parts, when, viewed, from, above, a, right, and, a, left, lobe, and, four, parts, when, viewed, from, below, left, right, caudate, and, quadrate, lobes, the, falciform, ligament, makes, a, superficial, division, of, the, liver, into, a, left, and, right, lobe, from, below, the, two, additional, lobes, are, located, between, the, right, and, left, lobes, one, in, front, of, the, other, a, line, can, be, imagined, running, from, the, left, of, the, vena, cava, and, all, the, way, forward, to, divide, the, liver, and, gallbladder, into, two, halves, this, line, is, called, cantlie, s, line, other, anatomical, landmarks, include, the, ligamentum, venosum, and, the, round, ligament, of, the, liver, which, further, divide, the, left, side, of, the, liver, in, two, sections, an, important, anatomical, landmark, the, porta, hepatis, divides, this, left, portion, into, four, segments, which, can, be, numbered, starting, at, the, caudate, lobe, as, i, in, an, anticlockwise, manner, from, this, parietal, view, seven, segments, can, be, seen, because, the, eighth, segment, is, only, visible, in, the, visceral, view, on, the, diaphragmatic, surface, apart, from, a, triangular, bare, area, where, it, connects, to, the, diaphragm, the, liver, is, covered, by, a, thin, double, layered, membrane, the, peritoneum, that, helps, to, reduce, friction, against, other, organs, this, surface, covers, the, convex, shape, of, the, two, lobes, where, it, accommodates, the, shape, of, the, diaphragm, the, peritoneum, folds, back, on, itself, to, form, the, falciform, ligament, and, the, right, and, left, triangular, ligaments, these, peritoneal, ligaments, are, not, related, to, the, anatomic, ligaments, in, joints, and, the, right, and, left, triangular, ligaments, have, no, known, functional, importance, though, they, serve, as, surface, landmarks, the, falciform, ligament, functions, to, attach, the, liver, to, the, posterior, portion, of, the, anterior, body, wall, the, visceral, surface, or, inferior, surface, is, uneven, and, concave, it, is, covered, in, peritoneum, apart, from, where, it, attaches, the, gallbladder, and, the, porta, hepatis, the, fossa, of, gallbladder, lies, to, the, right, of, the, quadrate, lobe, occupied, by, the, gallbladder, with, its, cystic, duct, close, to, the, right, end, of, porta, hepatis, several, impressions, on, the, surface, of, the, liver, accommodate, the, various, adjacent, structures, and, organs, underneath, the, right, lobe, and, to, the, right, of, the, gallbladder, fossa, are, two, impressions, one, behind, the, other, and, separated, by, a, ridge, the, one, in, front, is, a, shallow, colic, impression, formed, by, the, hepatic, flexure, and, the, one, behind, is, a, deeper, renal, impression, accommodating, part, of, the, right, kidney, and, part, of, the, suprarenal, gland, the, suprarenal, impression, is, a, small, triangular, depressed, area, on, the, liver, it, is, located, close, to, the, right, of, the, fossa, between, the, bare, area, and, the, caudate, lobe, and, immediately, above, the, renal, impression, the, greater, part, of, the, suprarenal, impression, is, devoid, of, peritoneum, and, it, lodges, the, right, suprarenal, gland, medial, to, the, renal, impression, is, a, third, and, slightly, marked, impression, lying, between, it, and, the, neck, of, the, gall, bladder, this, is, caused, by, the, descending, portion, of, the, duodenum, and, is, known, as, the, duodenal, impression, the, inferior, surface, of, the, left, lobe, of, the, liver, presents, behind, and, to, the, left, of, the, gastric, impression, this, is, moulded, over, the, upper, front, surface, of, the, stomach, and, to, the, right, of, this, is, a, rounded, eminence, the, tuber, omentale, which, fits, into, the, concavity, of, the, lesser, curvature, of, the, stomach, and, lies, in, front, of, the, anterior, layer, of, the, lesser, omentum, microscopically, each, liver, lobe, is, seen, to, be, made, up, of, hepatic, lobules, the, lobules, are, roughly, hexagonal, and, consist, of, plates, of, hepatocytes, and, sinusoids, radiating, from, a, central, vein, towards, an, imaginary, perimeter, of, interlobular, portal, triads, the, central, vein, joins, to, the, hepatic, vein, to, carry, blood, out, from, the, liver, a, distinctive, component, of, a, lobule, is, the, portal, triad, which, can, be, found, running, along, each, of, the, lobule, s, corners, the, portal, triad, consists, of, the, hepatic, artery, the, portal, vein, and, the, common, bile, duct, the, triad, may, be, seen, on, a, liver, ultrasound, as, a, mickey, mouse, sign, with, the, portal, vein, as, the, head, and, the, hepatic, artery, and, the, common, bile, duct, as, the, ears, histology, the, study, of, microscopic, anatomy, shows, two, major, types, of, liver, cell, parenchymal, cells, and, nonparenchymal, cells, about, 70, 85, of, the, liver, volume, is, occupied, by, parenchymal, hepatocytes, nonparenchymal, cells, constitute, 40, of, the, total, number, of, liver, cells, but, only, 6, 5, of, its, volume, the, liver, sinusoids, are, lined, with, two, types, of, cell, sinusoidal, endothelial, cells, and, phagocytic, kupffer, cells, hepatic, stellate, cells, are, nonparenchymal, cells, found, in, the, perisinusoidal, space, between, a, sinusoid, and, a, hepatocyte, additionally, intrahepatic, lymphocytes, are, often, present, in, the, sinusoidal, lumen, the, central, area, or, hepatic, hilum, includes, the, opening, known, as, the, porta, hepatis, which, carries, the, common, bile, duct, and, common, hepatic, artery, and, the, opening, for, the, portal, vein, the, duct, vein, and, artery, divide, into, left, and, right, branches, and, the, areas, of, the, liver, supplied, by, these, branches, constitute, the, functional, left, and, right, lobes, the, functional, lobes, are, separated, by, the, imaginary, plane, cantlie, s, line, joining, the, gallbladder, fossa, to, the, inferior, vena, cava, the, plane, separates, the, liver, into, the, true, right, and, left, lobes, the, middle, hepatic, vein, also, demarcates, the, true, right, and, left, lobes, the, right, lobe, is, further, divided, into, an, anterior, and, posterior, segment, by, the, right, hepatic, vein, the, left, lobe, is, divided, into, the, medial, and, lateral, segments, by, the, left, hepatic, vein, the, hilum, of, the, liver, is, described, in, terms, of, three, plates, that, contain, the, bile, ducts, and, blood, vessels, the, contents, of, the, whole, plate, system, are, surrounded, by, a, sheath, the, three, plates, are, the, hilar, plate, the, cystic, plate, and, the, umbilical, plate, and, the, plate, system, is, the, site, of, the, many, anatomical, variations, to, be, found, in, the, liver, in, the, widely, used, couinaud, system, the, functional, lobes, are, further, divided, into, a, total, of, eight, subsegments, based, on, a, transverse, plane, through, the, bifurcation, of, the, main, portal, vein, the, caudate, lobe, is, a, separate, structure, that, receives, blood, flow, from, both, the, right, and, left, sided, vascular, branches, the, couinaud, classification, divides, the, liver, into, eight, functionally, independent, liver, segments, each, segment, has, its, own, vascular, inflow, outflow, and, biliary, drainage, in, the, centre, of, each, segment, are, branches, of, the, portal, vein, hepatic, artery, and, bile, duct, in, the, periphery, of, each, segment, is, vascular, outflow, through, the, hepatic, veins, the, classification, system, uses, the, vascular, supply, in, the, liver, to, separate, the, functional, units, numbered, i, to, viii, with, unit, 1, the, caudate, lobe, receiving, its, supply, from, both, the, right, and, the, left, branches, of, the, portal, vein, it, contains, one, or, more, hepatic, veins, which, drain, directly, into, the, inferior, vena, cava, the, remainder, of, the, units, ii, to, viii, are, numbered, in, a, clockwise, fashion, about, 20, 000, protein, coding, genes, are, expressed, in, human, cells, and, 60, of, these, genes, are, expressed, in, a, normal, adult, liver, over, 400, genes, are, more, specifically, expressed, in, the, liver, with, some, 150, genes, highly, specific, for, liver, tissue, a, large, fraction, of, the, corresponding, liver, specific, proteins, are, mainly, expressed, in, hepatocytes, and, secreted, into, the, blood, and, constitute, plasma, proteins, and, hepatokines, other, liver, specific, proteins, are, certain, liver, enzymes, such, as, hao1, and, rdh16, proteins, involved, in, bile, synthesis, such, as, baat, and, slc27a5, and, transporter, proteins, involved, in, the, metabolism, of, drugs, such, as, abcb11, and, slc2a2, examples, of, highly, liver, specific, proteins, include, apolipoprotein, a, ii, coagulation, factors, f2, and, f9, complement, factor, related, proteins, and, the, fibrinogen, beta, chain, protein, organogenesis, the, development, of, the, organs, takes, place, from, the, third, to, the, eighth, week, during, embryogenesis, the, origins, of, the, liver, lie, in, both, the, ventral, portion, of, the, foregut, endoderm, endoderm, being, one, of, the, three, embryonic, germ, layers, and, the, constituents, of, the, adjacent, septum, transversum, mesenchyme, in, the, human, embryo, the, hepatic, diverticulum, is, the, tube, of, endoderm, that, extends, out, from, the, foregut, into, the, surrounding, mesenchyme, the, mesenchyme, of, septum, transversum, induces, this, endoderm, to, proliferate, to, branch, and, to, form, the, glandular, epithelium, of, the, liver, a, portion, of, the, hepatic, diverticulum, that, region, closest, to, the, digestive, tube, continues, to, function, as, the, drainage, duct, of, the, liver, and, a, branch, from, this, duct, produces, the, gallbladder, besides, signals, from, the, septum, transversum, mesenchyme, fibroblast, growth, factor, from, the, developing, heart, also, contributes, to, hepatic, competence, along, with, retinoic, acid, emanating, from, the, lateral, plate, mesoderm, the, hepatic, endodermal, cells, undergo, a, morphological, transition, from, columnar, to, pseudostratified, resulting, in, thickening, into, the, early, liver, bud, their, expansion, forms, a, population, of, the, bipotential, hepatoblasts, hepatic, stellate, cells, are, derived, from, mesenchyme, after, migration, of, hepatoblasts, into, the, septum, transversum, mesenchyme, the, hepatic, architecture, begins, to, be, established, with, liver, sinusoids, and, bile, canaliculi, appearing, the, liver, bud, separates, into, the, lobes, the, left, umbilical, vein, becomes, the, ductus, venosus, and, the, right, vitelline, vein, becomes, the, portal, vein, the, expanding, liver, bud, is, colonized, by, hematopoietic, cells, the, bipotential, hepatoblasts, begin, differentiating, into, biliary, epithelial, cells, and, hepatocytes, the, biliary, epithelial, cells, differentiate, from, hepatoblasts, around, portal, veins, first, producing, a, monolayer, and, then, a, bilayer, of, cuboidal, cells, in, ductal, plate, focal, dilations, emerge, at, points, in, the, bilayer, become, surrounded, by, portal, mesenchyme, and, undergo, tubulogenesis, into, intrahepatic, bile, ducts, hepatoblasts, not, adjacent, to, portal, veins, instead, differentiate, into, hepatocytes, and, arrange, into, cords, lined, by, sinusoidal, epithelial, cells, and, bile, canaliculi, once, hepatoblasts, are, specified, into, hepatocytes, and, undergo, further, expansion, they, begin, acquiring, the, functions, of, a, mature, hepatocyte, and, eventually, mature, hepatocytes, appear, as, highly, polarized, epithelial, cells, with, abundant, glycogen, accumulation, in, the, adult, liver, hepatocytes, are, not, equivalent, with, position, along, the, portocentrovenular, axis, within, a, liver, lobule, dictating, expression, of, metabolic, genes, involved, in, drug, metabolism, carbohydrate, metabolism, ammonia, detoxification, and, bile, production, and, secretion, wnt, catenin, has, now, been, identified, to, be, playing, a, key, role, in, this, phenomenon, at, birth, the, liver, comprises, roughly, 4, of, body, weight, and, weighs, on, average, about, 120, g, 4, oz, over, the, course, of, further, development, it, will, increase, to, 1, 4, 1, 6, kg, 3, 1, 3, 5, lb, but, will, only, take, up, 2, 5, 3, 5, of, body, weight, hepatosomatic, index, hsi, is, the, ratio, of, liver, weight, to, body, weight, in, the, growing, fetus, a, major, source, of, blood, to, the, liver, is, the, umbilical, vein, which, supplies, nutrients, to, the, growing, fetus, the, umbilical, vein, enters, the, abdomen, at, the, umbilicus, and, passes, upward, along, the, free, margin, of, the, falciform, ligament, of, the, liver, to, the, inferior, surface, of, the, liver, there, it, joins, with, the, left, branch, of, the, portal, vein, the, ductus, venosus, carries, blood, from, the, left, portal, vein, to, the, left, hepatic, vein, and, then, to, the, inferior, vena, cava, allowing, placental, blood, to, bypass, the, liver, in, the, fetus, the, liver, does, not, perform, the, normal, digestive, processes, and, filtration, of, the, infant, liver, because, nutrients, are, received, directly, from, the, mother, via, the, placenta, the, fetal, liver, releases, some, blood, stem, cells, that, migrate, to, the, fetal, thymus, creating, the, t, cells, or, t, lymphocytes, after, birth, the, formation, of, blood, stem, cells, shifts, to, the, red, bone, marrow, after, 2, 5, days, the, umbilical, vein, and, ductus, venosus, are, obliterated, the, former, becomes, the, round, ligament, of, liver, and, the, latter, becomes, the, ligamentum, venosum, in, the, disorders, of, cirrhosis, and, portal, hypertension, the, umbilical, vein, can, open, up, again, unlike, eutherian, mammals, in, marsupials, the, liver, remains, haematopoietic, well, after, birth, the, various, functions, of, the, liver, are, carried, out, by, the, liver, cells, or, hepatocytes, the, liver, is, thought, to, be, responsible, for, up, to, 500, separate, functions, usually, in, combination, with, other, systems, and, organs, currently, no, artificial, organ, or, device, is, capable, of, reproducing, all, the, functions, of, the, liver, some, functions, can, be, carried, out, by, liver, dialysis, an, experimental, treatment, for, liver, failure, the, liver, also, accounts, for, about, 20, of, resting, total, body, oxygen, consumption, the, liver, receives, a, dual, blood, supply, from, the, hepatic, portal, vein, and, hepatic, arteries, the, hepatic, portal, vein, delivers, around, 75, of, the, liver, s, blood, supply, and, carries, venous, blood, drained, from, the, spleen, gastrointestinal, tract, and, its, associated, organs, the, hepatic, arteries, supply, arterial, blood, to, the, liver, accounting, for, the, remaining, quarter, of, its, blood, flow, oxygen, is, provided, from, both, sources, about, half, of, the, liver, s, oxygen, demand, is, met, by, the, hepatic, portal, vein, and, half, is, met, by, the, hepatic, arteries, the, hepatic, artery, also, has, both, alpha, and, beta, adrenergic, receptors, therefore, flow, through, the, artery, is, controlled, in, part, by, the, splanchnic, nerves, of, the, autonomic, nervous, system, blood, flows, through, the, liver, sinusoids, and, empties, into, the, central, vein, of, each, lobule, the, central, veins, coalesce, into, hepatic, veins, which, leave, the, liver, and, drain, into, the, inferior, vena, cava, the, biliary, tract, is, derived, from, the, branches, of, the, bile, ducts, the, biliary, tract, also, known, as, the, biliary, tree, is, the, path, by, which, bile, is, secreted, by, the, liver, then, transported, to, the, first, part, of, the, small, intestine, the, duodenum, the, bile, produced, in, the, liver, is, collected, in, bile, canaliculi, small, grooves, between, the, faces, of, adjacent, hepatocytes, the, canaliculi, radiate, to, the, edge, of, the, liver, lobule, where, they, merge, to, form, bile, ducts, within, the, liver, these, ducts, are, termed, intrahepatic, bile, ducts, and, once, they, exit, the, liver, they, are, considered, extrahepatic, the, intrahepatic, ducts, eventually, drain, into, the, right, and, left, hepatic, ducts, which, exit, the, liver, at, the, transverse, fissure, and, merge, to, form, the, common, hepatic, duct, the, cystic, duct, from, the, gallbladder, joins, with, the, common, hepatic, duct, to, form, the, common, bile, duct, the, biliary, system, and, connective, tissue, is, supplied, by, the, hepatic, artery, alone, bile, either, drains, directly, into, the, duodenum, via, the, common, bile, duct, or, is, temporarily, stored, in, the, gallbladder, via, the, cystic, duct, the, common, bile, duct, and, the, pancreatic, duct, enter, the, second, part, of, the, duodenum, together, at, the, hepatopancreatic, ampulla, also, known, as, the, ampulla, of, vater, the, liver, plays, a, major, role, in, carbohydrate, protein, amino, acid, and, lipid, metabolism, the, liver, performs, several, roles, in, carbohydrate, metabolism, the, liver, is, responsible, for, the, mainstay, of, protein, metabolism, synthesis, as, well, as, degradation, all, plasma, proteins, except, gamma, globulins, are, synthesised, in, the, liver, it, is, also, responsible, for, a, large, part, of, amino, acid, synthesis, the, liver, plays, a, role, in, the, production, of, clotting, factors, as, well, as, red, blood, cell, production, some, of, the, proteins, synthesized, by, the, liver, include, coagulation, factors, i, fibrinogen, ii, prothrombin, v, vii, viii, ix, x, xi, xii, xiii, as, well, as, protein, c, protein, s, and, antithrombin, the, liver, is, a, major, site, of, production, for, thrombopoietin, a, glycoprotein, hormone, that, regulates, the, production, of, platelets, by, the, bone, marrow, the, liver, plays, several, roles, in, lipid, metabolism, it, performs, cholesterol, synthesis, lipogenesis, and, the, production, of, triglycerides, and, a, bulk, of, the, body, s, lipoproteins, are, synthesized, in, the, liver, the, liver, plays, a, key, role, in, digestion, as, it, produces, and, excretes, bile, a, yellowish, liquid, required, for, emulsifying, fats, and, help, the, absorption, of, vitamin, k, from, the, diet, some, of, the, bile, drains, directly, into, the, duodenum, and, some, is, stored, in, the, gallbladder, the, liver, produces, insulin, like, growth, factor, 1, a, polypeptide, protein, hormone, that, plays, an, important, role, in, childhood, growth, and, continues, to, have, anabolic, effects, in, adults, the, liver, is, responsible, for, the, breakdown, of, insulin, and, other, hormones, the, liver, breaks, down, bilirubin, via, glucuronidation, facilitating, its, excretion, into, bile, the, liver, is, responsible, for, the, breakdown, and, excretion, of, many, waste, products, it, plays, a, key, role, in, breaking, down, or, modifying, toxic, substances, e, g, methylation, and, most, medicinal, products, in, a, process, called, drug, metabolism, this, sometimes, results, in, toxication, when, the, metabolite, is, more, toxic, than, its, precursor, preferably, the, toxins, are, conjugated, to, avail, excretion, in, bile, or, urine, the, liver, converts, ammonia, into, urea, as, part, of, the, ornithine, cycle, or, the, urea, cycle, and, the, urea, is, excreted, in, the, urine, because, the, liver, is, an, expandable, organ, large, quantities, of, blood, can, be, stored, in, its, blood, vessels, its, normal, blood, volume, including, both, that, in, the, hepatic, veins, and, that, in, the, hepatic, sinuses, is, about, 450, milliliters, or, almost, 10, percent, of, the, body, s, total, blood, volume, when, high, pressure, in, the, right, atrium, causes, backpressure, in, the, liver, the, liver, expands, and, 0, 5, to, 1, liter, of, extra, blood, is, occasionally, stored, in, the, hepatic, veins, and, sinuses, this, occurs, especially, in, cardiac, failure, with, peripheral, congestion, thus, in, effect, the, liver, is, a, large, expandable, venous, organ, capable, of, acting, as, a, valuable, blood, reservoir, in, times, of, excess, blood, volume, and, capable, of, supplying, extra, blood, in, times, of, diminished, blood, volume, because, the, pores, in, the, hepatic, sinusoids, are, very, permeable, and, allow, ready, passage, of, both, fluid, and, proteins, into, the, perisinusoidal, space, the, lymph, draining, from, the, liver, usually, has, a, protein, concentration, of, about, 6, g, dl, which, is, only, slightly, less, than, the, protein, concentration, of, plasma, also, the, high, permeability, of, the, liver, sinusoid, epithelium, allows, large, quantities, of, lymph, to, form, therefore, about, half, of, all, the, lymph, formed, in, the, body, under, resting, conditions, arises, in, the, liver, the, liver, is, a, vital, organ, and, supports, almost, every, other, organ, in, the, body, because, of, its, strategic, location, and, multidimensional, functions, the, liver, is, prone, to, many, diseases, the, bare, area, of, the, liver, is, a, site, that, is, vulnerable, to, the, passing, of, infection, from, the, abdominal, cavity, to, the, thoracic, cavity, liver, diseases, may, be, diagnosed, by, liver, function, tests, blood, tests, that, can, identify, various, markers, for, example, acute, phase, reactants, are, produced, by, the, liver, in, response, to, injury, or, inflammation, the, most, common, chronic, liver, disease, is, nonalcoholic, fatty, liver, disease, which, affects, an, estimated, one, third, of, the, world, population, hepatitis, is, a, common, condition, of, inflammation, of, the, liver, the, most, usual, cause, of, this, is, viral, and, the, most, common, of, these, infections, are, hepatitis, a, b, c, d, and, e, some, of, these, infections, are, sexually, transmitted, inflammation, can, also, be, caused, by, other, viruses, in, the, family, herpesviridae, such, as, the, herpes, simplex, virus, chronic, rather, than, acute, infection, with, hepatitis, b, virus, or, hepatitis, c, virus, is, the, main, cause, of, liver, cancer, globally, about, 248, million, individuals, are, chronically, infected, with, hepatitis, b, with, 843, 724, in, the, u, s, and, 142, million, are, chronically, infected, with, hepatitis, c, with, 2, 7, million, in, the, u, s, globally, there, are, about, 114, million, and, 20, million, cases, of, hepatitis, a, and, hepatitis, e, respectively, but, these, generally, resolve, and, do, not, become, chronic, hepatitis, d, virus, is, a, satellite, of, hepatitis, b, virus, it, can, only, infect, in, the, presence, of, hepatitis, b, and, co, infects, nearly, 20, million, people, with, hepatitis, b, globally, hepatic, encephalopathy, is, caused, by, an, accumulation, of, toxins, in, the, bloodstream, that, are, normally, removed, by, the, liver, this, condition, can, result, in, coma, and, can, prove, fatal, budd, chiari, syndrome, is, a, condition, caused, by, blockage, of, the, hepatic, veins, including, thrombosis, that, drain, the, liver, it, presents, with, the, classical, triad, of, abdominal, pain, ascites, and, liver, enlargement, many, diseases, of, the, liver, are, accompanied, by, jaundice, caused, by, increased, levels, of, bilirubin, in, the, system, the, bilirubin, results, from, the, breakup, of, the, hemoglobin, of, dead, red, blood, cells, normally, the, liver, removes, bilirubin, from, the, blood, and, excretes, it, through, bile, other, disorders, caused, by, excessive, alcohol, consumption, are, grouped, under, alcoholic, liver, diseases, and, these, include, alcoholic, hepatitis, fatty, liver, and, cirrhosis, factors, contributing, to, the, development, of, alcoholic, liver, diseases, are, not, only, the, quantity, and, frequency, of, alcohol, consumption, but, can, also, include, gender, genetics, and, liver, insult, liver, damage, can, also, be, caused, by, drugs, particularly, paracetamol, and, drugs, used, to, treat, cancer, a, rupture, of, the, liver, can, be, caused, by, a, liver, shot, used, in, combat, sports, primary, biliary, cholangitis, is, an, autoimmune, disease, of, the, liver, it, is, marked, by, slow, progressive, destruction, of, the, small, bile, ducts, of, the, liver, with, the, intralobular, ducts, canals, of, hering, affected, early, in, the, disease, when, these, ducts, are, damaged, bile, and, other, toxins, build, up, in, the, liver, cholestasis, and, over, time, damages, the, liver, tissue, in, combination, with, ongoing, immune, related, damage, this, can, lead, to, scarring, fibrosis, and, cirrhosis, cirrhosis, increases, the, resistance, to, blood, flow, in, the, liver, and, can, result, in, portal, hypertension, congested, anastomoses, between, the, portal, venous, system, and, the, systemic, circulation, can, be, a, subsequent, condition, there, are, also, many, pediatric, liver, diseases, including, biliary, atresia, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, deficiency, alagille, syndrome, progressive, familial, intrahepatic, cholestasis, langerhans, cell, histiocytosis, and, hepatic, hemangioma, a, benign, tumour, the, most, common, type, of, liver, tumour, thought, to, be, congenital, a, genetic, disorder, causing, multiple, cysts, to, form, in, the, liver, tissue, usually, in, later, life, and, usually, asymptomatic, is, polycystic, liver, disease, diseases, that, interfere, with, liver, function, will, lead, to, derangement, of, these, processes, however, the, liver, has, a, great, capacity, to, regenerate, and, has, a, large, reserve, capacity, in, most, cases, the, liver, only, produces, symptoms, after, extensive, damage, hepatomegaly, refers, to, an, enlarged, liver, and, can, be, due, to, many, causes, it, can, be, palpated, in, a, liver, span, measurement, the, classic, symptoms, of, liver, damage, include, the, following, the, diagnosis, of, liver, disease, is, made, by, liver, function, tests, groups, of, blood, tests, that, can, readily, show, the, extent, of, liver, damage, if, infection, is, suspected, then, other, serological, tests, will, be, carried, out, a, physical, examination, of, the, liver, can, only, reveal, its, size, and, any, tenderness, and, some, form, of, imaging, such, as, an, ultrasound, or, ct, scan, may, also, be, needed, sometimes, a, liver, biopsy, will, be, necessary, and, a, tissue, sample, is, taken, through, a, needle, inserted, into, the, skin, just, below, the, rib, cage, this, procedure, may, be, helped, by, a, sonographer, providing, ultrasound, guidance, to, an, interventional, radiologist, the, liver, is, the, only, human, internal, organ, capable, of, natural, regeneration, of, lost, tissue, as, little, as, 25, of, a, liver, can, regenerate, into, a, whole, liver, this, is, however, not, true, regeneration, but, rather, compensatory, growth, in, mammals, the, lobes, that, are, removed, do, not, regrow, and, the, growth, of, the, liver, is, a, restoration, of, function, not, original, form, this, contrasts, with, true, regeneration, where, both, original, function, and, form, are, restored, in, some, other, species, such, as, zebrafish, the, liver, undergoes, true, regeneration, by, restoring, both, shape, and, size, of, the, organ, in, the, liver, large, areas, of, the, tissues, are, formed, but, for, the, formation, of, new, cells, there, must, be, sufficient, amount, of, material, so, the, circulation, of, the, blood, becomes, more, active, this, is, predominantly, due, to, the, hepatocytes, re, entering, the, cell, cycle, that, is, the, hepatocytes, go, from, the, quiescent, g0, phase, to, the, g1, phase, and, undergo, mitosis, this, process, is, activated, by, the, p75, receptors, there, is, also, some, evidence, of, bipotential, stem, cells, called, hepatic, oval, cells, or, ovalocytes, not, to, be, confused, with, oval, red, blood, cells, of, ovalocytosis, which, are, thought, to, reside, in, the, canals, of, hering, these, cells, can, differentiate, into, either, hepatocytes, or, cholangiocytes, cholangiocytes, are, the, epithelial, lining, cells, of, the, bile, ducts, they, are, cuboidal, epithelium, in, the, small, interlobular, bile, ducts, but, become, columnar, and, mucus, secreting, in, larger, bile, ducts, approaching, the, porta, hepatis, and, the, extrahepatic, ducts, research, is, being, carried, out, on, the, use, of, stem, cells, for, the, generation, of, an, artificial, liver, scientific, and, medical, works, about, liver, regeneration, often, refer, to, the, greek, titan, prometheus, who, was, chained, to, a, rock, in, the, caucasus, where, each, day, his, liver, was, devoured, by, an, eagle, only, to, grow, back, each, night, the, myth, suggests, the, ancient, greeks, may, have, known, about, the, liver, s, remarkable, capacity, for, self, repair, human, liver, transplants, were, first, performed, by, thomas, starzl, in, the, united, states, and, roy, calne, in, cambridge, england, in, 1963, and, 1967, respectively, liver, transplantation, is, the, only, option, for, those, with, irreversible, liver, failure, most, transplants, are, done, for, chronic, liver, diseases, leading, to, cirrhosis, such, as, chronic, hepatitis, c, alcoholism, and, autoimmune, hepatitis, less, commonly, liver, transplantation, is, done, for, fulminant, hepatic, failure, in, which, liver, failure, occurs, rapidly, over, a, period, of, days, or, weeks, liver, allografts, for, transplant, usually, come, from, donors, who, have, died, from, fatal, brain, injury, living, donor, liver, transplantation, is, a, technique, in, which, a, portion, of, a, living, person, s, liver, is, removed, hepatectomy, and, used, to, replace, the, entire, liver, of, the, recipient, this, was, first, performed, in, 1989, for, pediatric, liver, transplantation, only, 20, percent, of, an, adult, s, liver, couinaud, segments, 2, and, 3, is, needed, to, serve, as, a, liver, allograft, for, an, infant, or, small, child, more, recently, adult, to, adult, liver, transplantation, has, been, done, using, the, donor, s, right, hepatic, lobe, which, amounts, to, 60, percent, of, the, liver, due, to, the, ability, of, the, liver, to, regenerate, both, the, donor, and, recipient, end, up, with, normal, liver, function, if, all, goes, well, this, procedure, is, more, controversial, as, it, entails, performing, a, much, larger, operation, on, the, donor, and, indeed, there, were, at, least, two, donor, deaths, out, of, the, first, several, hundred, cases, a, 2006, publication, addressed, the, problem, of, donor, mortality, and, found, at, least, fourteen, cases, the, risk, of, postoperative, complications, and, death, is, far, greater, in, right, sided, operations, than, that, in, left, sided, operations, with, the, recent, advances, of, noninvasive, imaging, living, liver, donors, usually, have, to, undergo, imaging, examinations, for, liver, anatomy, to, decide, if, the, anatomy, is, feasible, for, donation, the, evaluation, is, usually, performed, by, multidetector, row, computed, tomography, mdct, and, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, mdct, is, good, in, vascular, anatomy, and, volumetry, mri, is, used, for, biliary, tree, anatomy, donors, with, very, unusual, vascular, anatomy, which, makes, them, unsuitable, for, donation, could, be, screened, out, to, avoid, unnecessary, operations, some, cultures, regard, the, liver, as, the, seat, of, the, soul, in, greek, mythology, the, gods, punished, prometheus, for, revealing, fire, to, humans, by, chaining, him, to, a, rock, where, a, vulture, or, an, eagle, would, peck, out, his, liver, which, would, regenerate, overnight, the, liver, is, the, only, human, internal, organ, that, actually, can, regenerate, itself, to, a, significant, extent, many, ancient, peoples, of, the, near, east, and, mediterranean, areas, practiced, a, type, of, divination, called, haruspicy, or, hepatomancy, where, they, tried, to, obtain, information, by, examining, the, livers, of, sheep, and, other, animals, in, plato, and, in, later, physiology, the, liver, was, thought, to, be, the, seat, of, the, darkest, emotions, specifically, wrath, jealousy, and, greed, which, drive, men, to, action, the, talmud, tractate, berakhot, 61b, refers, to, the, liver, as, the, seat, of, anger, with, the, gallbladder, counteracting, this, the, persian, urdu, and, hindi, languages, or, or, jigar, refer, to, the, liver, in, figurative, speech, to, indicate, courage, and, strong, feelings, or, their, best, e, g, this, mecca, has,

an, adjective, for, any, object, which, is, desirable, especially, women, in, the, zulu, language, the, word, for, liver, isibindi, is, the, same, as, the, word, for, courage, in, english, the, term, lily, livered, is, used, to, indicate, cowardice, from, the, medieval, belief, that, the, liver, was, the, seat, of, courage, spanish, h, gados, also, means, courage, however, the, secondary, meaning, of, basque, gibel, is, indolence, in, biblical, hebrew, the, word, for, liver, kauved, stemmed, kbd, or, kvd, similar, to, arabic, also, means, heavy, and, is, used, to, describe, the, rich, heavy, with, possessions, and, honor, presumably, for, the, same, reason, in, the, book, of, lamentations, 2, 11, it, is, used, to, describe, the, physiological, responses, to, sadness, by, my, liver, spilled, to, earth, along, with, the, flow, of, tears, and, the, overturning, in, bitterness, of, the, intestines, on, several, occasions, in, the, book, of, psalms, most, notably, 16, 9, the, word, is, used, to, describe, happiness, in, the, liver, along, with, the, heart, which, beats, rapidly, and, the, flesh, which, appears, red, under, the, skin, further, usage, as, the, self, similar, to, your, honor, is, widely, available, throughout, the, old, testament, sometimes, compared, to, the, breathing, soul, genesis, 49, 6, psalms, 7, 6, etc, an, honorable, hat, was, also, referred, to, with, this, word, job, 19, 9, etc, and, under, that, definition, appears, many, times, along, with, pe, er, grandeur, these, four, meanings, were, used, in, preceding, ancient, afro, asiatic, languages, such, as, akkadian, and, ancient, egyptian, preserved, in, classical, ethiopic, ge, ez, language, humans, commonly, eat, the, livers, of, mammals, fowl, and, fish, as, food, domestic, pig, ox, lamb, calf, chicken, and, goose, livers, are, widely, available, from, butchers, and, supermarkets, in, the, romance, languages, the, anatomical, word, for, liver, french, foie, spanish, h, gado,

french, cuisine, the, humr, are, one, of, the, tribes, in, the, baggara, ethnic, group, native, to, southwestern, kordofan, in, sudan, who, speak, shuwa, chadian, arabic, make, a, non, alcoholic, drink, from, the, liver, and, bone, marrow, of, the, giraffe, which, they, call, umm, nyolokh, they, claim, it, is, intoxicating, arabic, sakran, causing, dreams, and, even, waking, hallucinations, anthropologist, ian, cunnison, accompanied, the, humr, on, one, of, their, giraffe, hunting, expeditions, in, the, late, 1950s, and, noted, that, cunnison, s, remarkable, account, of, an, apparently, psychoactive, mammal, found, its, way, from, a, somewhat, obscure, scientific, paper, into, more, mainstream, literature, through, a, conversation, between, w, james, of, the, institute, of, social, and, cultural, anthropology, at, the, university, of, oxford, and, specialist, on, the, use, of, hallucinogens, and, intoxicants, in, society, and, r, rudgley, who, discussed, it, in, a, book, on, psychoactive, drugs, for, general, readers, he, speculated, that, a, hallucinogenic, compound, n, n, dimethyltryptamine, in, the, giraffe, liver, might, account, for, the, intoxicating, properties, claimed, for, umm, nyolokh, cunnison, on, the, other, hand, writing, in, 1958, found, it, hard, to, believe, in, the, literal, truth, of, the, humr, s, assertion, that, the, drink, was, intoxicating, the, study, of, entheogens, in, general, including, entheogens, of, animal, origin, e, g, hallucinogenic, fish, and, toad, venom, has, however, made, considerable, progress, in, the, sixty, odd, years, since, cunnison, s, report, the, idea, that, some, intoxicating, substance, might, reside, in, giraffe, livers, may, no, longer, be, as, far, fetched, as, it, seemed, to, cunnison, however, to, date, proof, or, disproof, still, waits, on, detailed, analyses, of, the, organ, and, the, beverage, made, from, it, certain, tungusic, peoples, of, northeast, asia, formerly, prepared, a, type, of, arrow, poison, from, rotting, animal, livers, which, was, in, later, times, also, applied, to, bullets, russian, anthropologist, s, m, shirokogoroff, wrote, that, the, liver, is, found, in, all, vertebrates, and, is, typically, the, largest, internal, organ, the, internal, structure, of, the, liver, is, broadly, similar, in, all, vertebrates, though, its, form, varies, considerably, in, different, species, and, is, largely, determined, by, the, shape, and, arrangement, of, the, surrounding, organs, nonetheless, in, most, species, it, is, divided, into, right, and, left, lobes, exceptions, to, this, general, rule, include, snakes, where, the, shape, of, the, body, necessitates, a, simple, cigar, like, form, in, neonatal, marsupials, it, is, responsible, for, the, production, of, blood, cells, an, organ, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, liver, is, found, associated, with, the, digestive, tract, of, the, primitive, chordate, amphioxus, although, it, performs, many, functions, of, a, liver, it, is, not, considered, a, true, liver, but, rather, a, homolog, of, the, vertebrate, liver, the, amphioxus, hepatic, caecum, produces, the, liver, specific, proteins, vitellogenin, antithrombin, plasminogen, alanine, aminotransferase, and, insulin, insulin, like, growth, factor
