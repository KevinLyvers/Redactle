coral, reef, fish, are, fish, which, live, amongst, or, in, close, relation, to, coral, reefs, coral, reefs, form, complex, ecosystems, with, tremendous, biodiversity, among, the, myriad, inhabitants, the, fish, stand, out, as, colourful, and, interesting, to, watch, hundreds, of, species, can, exist, in, a, small, area, of, a, healthy, reef, many, of, them, hidden, or, well, camouflaged, reef, fish, have, developed, many, ingenious, specialisations, adapted, to, survival, on, the, reefs, coral, reefs, occupy, less, than, 1, of, the, surface, area, of, the, world, oceans, but, provide, a, home, for, 25, of, all, marine, fish, species, reef, habitats, are, a, sharp, contrast, to, the, open, water, habitats, that, make, up, the, other, 99, of, the, world, oceans, however, loss, and, degradation, of, coral, reef, habitat, increasing, pollution, and, overfishing, including, the, use, of, destructive, fishing, practices, are, threatening, the, survival, of, the, coral, reefs, and, the, associated, reef, fish, coral, reefs, are, the, result, of, millions, of, years, of, coevolution, among, algae, invertebrates, and, fish, they, have, become, crowded, and, complex, environments, and, the, fish, have, evolved, many, ingenious, ways, of, surviving, most, fishes, found, on, coral, reefs, are, ray, finned, fishes, known, for, the, characteristic, sharp, bony, rays, and, spines, in, their, fins, these, spines, provide, formidable, defences, and, when, erected, they, can, usually, be, locked, in, place, or, are, venomous, many, reef, fish, have, also, evolved, cryptic, coloration, to, confuse, predators, reef, fish, have, also, evolved, complex, adaptive, behaviours, small, reef, fish, get, protection, from, predators, by, hiding, in, reef, crevices, or, by, shoaling, and, schooling, many, reef, fish, confine, themselves, to, one, small, neighbourhood, where, every, hiding, place, is, known, and, can, be, immediately, accessed, others, cruise, the, reefs, for, food, in, shoals, but, return, to, a, known, area, to, hide, when, they, are, inactive, resting, small, fish, are, still, vulnerable, to, attack, by, crevice, predators, so, many, fish, such, as, triggerfish, squeeze, into, a, small, hiding, place, and, wedge, themselves, by, erecting, their, spines, as, an, example, of, the, adaptations, made, by, reef, fish, the, yellow, tang, is, a, herbivore, which, feeds, on, benthic, turf, algae, they, also, provide, cleaner, services, to, marine, turtles, by, removing, algal, growth, from, their, shells, they, do, not, tolerate, other, fish, with, the, same, colour, or, shape, when, alarmed, the, usually, placid, yellow, tang, can, erect, spines, in, its, tail, and, slash, at, its, opponent, with, rapid, sideways, movements, coral, reefs, contain, the, most, diverse, fish, assemblages, to, be, found, anywhere, on, earth, with, perhaps, as, many, as, 6, 000, 8, 000, species, dwelling, within, coral, reef, ecosystems, of, the, world, s, oceans, the, mechanisms, that, first, led, to, and, continue, to, maintain, such, concentrations, of, fish, species, on, coral, reefs, has, been, widely, debated, over, the, last, 50, years, while, many, reasons, have, been, proposed, there, is, no, general, scientific, consensus, on, which, of, these, is, the, most, influential, but, it, seems, likely, that, a, number, of, factors, contribute, these, include, the, rich, habitat, complexity, and, diversity, inherent, in, coral, reef, ecosystems, the, wide, variety, and, temporal, availability, of, food, resources, available, to, coral, reef, fishes, a, host, of, pre, and, post, larval, settlement, processes, and, as, yet, unresolved, interactions, between, all, these, factors, the, wealth, of, fishes, on, reefs, is, filled, by, tiny, bottom, dwelling, reef, fishes, there, are, two, major, regions, of, coral, reef, development, recognized, the, indo, pacific, which, includes, the, pacific, and, indian, oceans, as, well, as, the, red, sea, and, the, tropical, western, atlantic, also, known, as, the, wider, or, greater, caribbean, each, of, these, two, regions, contains, its, own, unique, coral, reef, fish, fauna, with, no, natural, overlap, in, species, of, the, two, regions, the, richest, by, far, in, terms, of, reef, fish, diversity, is, the, indo, pacific, where, there, are, an, estimated, 4, 000, 5, 000, species, of, fishes, associated, with, coral, reef, habitats, another, 500, 700, species, can, be, found, in, the, greater, caribbean, region, most, reef, fishes, have, body, shapes, that, are, different, from, open, water, fishes, open, water, fish, are, usually, built, for, speed, in, the, open, sea, streamlined, like, torpedoes, to, minimise, friction, as, they, move, through, the, water, reef, fish, are, operating, in, the, relatively, confined, spaces, and, complex, underwater, landscapes, of, coral, reefs, for, this, manoeuvrability, is, more, important, than, straight, line, speed, so, coral, reef, fish, have, developed, bodies, which, optimize, their, ability, to, dart, and, change, direction, they, outwit, predators, by, dodging, into, fissures, in, the, reef, or, playing, hide, and, seek, around, coral, heads, many, reef, fish, such, as, butterflyfish, and, angelfishes, have, evolved, bodies, which, are, deep, and, laterally, compressed, like, a, pancake, their, pelvic, and, pectoral, fins, are, designed, differently, so, they, act, together, with, the, flattened, body, to, optimise, manoeuvrability, coral, reef, fishes, exhibit, a, huge, variety, of, dazzling, and, sometimes, bizarre, colours, and, patterns, this, is, in, marked, contrasts, to, open, water, fishes, which, are, usually, countershaded, with, silvery, colours, the, patterns, have, different, functions, sometimes, they, camouflage, the, fish, when, the, fish, rests, in, places, with, the, right, background, colouration, can, also, be, used, to, help, species, recognition, during, mating, some, unmistakable, contrasting, patterns, are, used, to, warn, predators, that, the, fish, has, venomous, spines, or, poisonous, flesh, the, foureye, butterflyfish, gets, its, name, from, a, large, dark, spot, on, the, rear, portion, of, each, side, of, the, body, this, spot, is, surrounded, by, a, brilliant, white, ring, resembling, an, eyespot, a, black, vertical, bar, on, the, head, runs, through, the, true, eye, making, it, hard, to, see, this, can, result, in, a, predator, thinking, the, fish, is, bigger, than, it, is, and, confusing, the, back, end, with, the, front, end, the, butterflyfish, s, first, instinct, when, threatened, is, to, flee, putting, the, false, eyespot, closer, to, the, predator, than, the, head, most, predators, aim, for, the, eyes, and, this, false, eyespot, tricks, the, predator, into, believing, that, the, fish, will, flee, tail, first, when, escape, is, not, possible, the, butterflyfish, will, sometimes, turn, to, face, its, aggressor, head, lowered, and, spines, fully, erect, like, a, bull, about, to, charge, this, may, serve, to, intimidate, the, other, animal, or, may, remind, the, predator, that, the, butterflyfish, is, too, spiny, to, make, a, comfortable, meal, the, psychedelic, synchiropus, splendidus, right, is, not, easily, seen, due, to, its, bottom, feeding, habit, and, its, small, size, reaching, only, about, 6, cm, it, feeds, primarily, on, small, crustaceans, and, other, invertebrates, and, is, popular, in, the, aquarium, trade, just, as, some, prey, species, evolved, cryptic, colouration, and, patterns, to, help, avoid, predators, some, ambush, predators, evolved, camouflage, that, lets, them, ambush, their, prey, the, tasseled, scorpionfish, is, an, ambush, predator, that, looks, like, part, of, a, sea, floor, encrusted, with, coral, and, algae, it, lies, in, wait, on, the, sea, floor, for, crustaceans, and, small, fish, such, as, gobies, to, pass, by, another, ambush, predator, is, the, striated, frogfish, right, they, lie, on, the, bottom, and, wave, a, conspicuous, worm, like, lure, strategically, attached, above, their, mouth, normally, about, 10, cm, 4, in, long, they, can, also, inflate, themselves, like, puffers, gobies, avoid, predators, by, tucking, themselves, into, coral, crevices, or, partly, burying, themselves, in, sand, they, continually, scan, for, predators, with, eyes, that, swivel, independently, the, camouflage, of, the, tasseled, scorpionfish, can, prevent, gobies, from, seeing, them, until, it, s, too, late, the, clown, triggerfish, has, strong, jaws, for, crushing, and, eating, sea, urchins, crustaceans, and, hard, shell, molluscs, its, ventral, lower, surface, has, large, white, spots, on, a, dark, background, and, its, dorsal, upper, surface, has, black, spots, on, yellow, this, is, a, form, of, countershading, from, below, the, white, spots, look, like, the, lighted, surface, of, the, water, above, and, from, above, the, fish, blends, more, with, the, coral, reef, below, the, brightly, painted, yellow, mouth, may, deter, potential, predators, many, reef, fish, species, have, evolved, different, feeding, strategies, accompanied, by, specialized, mouths, jaws, and, teeth, particularly, suited, to, deal, with, their, primary, food, sources, found, in, coral, reef, ecosystems, some, species, even, shift, their, dietary, habits, and, distributions, as, they, mature, this, is, not, surprising, given, the, huge, variety, in, the, types, of, prey, on, offer, around, coral, reefs, for, example, the, primary, food, source, of, butterflyfishes, are, the, coral, polyps, themselves, or, the, appendages, of, polychaetes, and, other, small, invertebrate, animals, their, mouths, protrude, like, forceps, and, are, equipped, with, fine, teeth, that, allow, them, to, nip, off, such, exposed, body, parts, of, their, prey, parrotfishes, eat, algae, growing, on, reef, surfaces, utilizing, mouths, like, beaks, well, adapted, to, scrape, off, their, food, other, fish, like, snapper, are, generalized, feeders, with, more, standard, jaw, and, mouth, structures, that, allow, them, to, forage, on, a, wide, range, of, animal, prey, types, including, small, fishes, and, invertebrates, carnivores, are, the, most, diverse, of, feeding, types, among, coral, reef, fishes, there, are, many, more, carnivore, species, on, the, reefs, than, herbivores, competition, among, carnivores, is, intense, resulting, in, a, treacherous, environment, for, their, prey, hungry, predators, lurk, in, ambush, or, patrol, every, part, of, the, reef, night, and, day, some, fishes, associated, with, reefs, are, generalized, carnivores, that, feed, on, a, variety, of, animal, prey, these, typically, have, large, mouths, that, can, be, rapidly, expanded, thereby, drawing, in, nearby, water, and, any, unfortunate, animals, contained, within, the, inhaled, water, mass, the, water, is, then, expelled, through, the, gills, with, the, mouth, closed, thereby, trapping, the, helpless, prey, for, example, the, bluestripe, snapper, has, a, varied, diet, feeding, on, fishes, shrimps, crabs, stomatopods, cephalopods, and, planktonic, crustaceans, as, well, as, plant, and, algae, material, diet, varies, with, age, location, and, the, prevalent, prey, items, locally, goatfish, are, tireless, benthic, feeders, using, a, pair, of, long, chemosensory, barbels, whiskers, protruding, from, their, chins, to, rifle, through, the, sediments, in, search, of, a, meal, like, goats, they, seek, anything, edible, worms, crustaceans, molluscs, and, other, small, invertebrates, are, staples, the, yellowfin, goatfish, mulloidichthys, vanicolensis, often, schools, with, the, blue, striped, snapper, the, yellowfins, change, their, colouration, to, match, that, of, the, snapper, presumably, this, is, for, predator, protection, since, goatfish, are, a, more, preferred, prey, than, bluestripe, snapper, by, night, the, schools, disperse, and, individual, goatfish, head, their, separate, ways, to, loot, the, sands, other, nocturnal, feeders, shadow, the, active, goatfish, waiting, patiently, for, overlooked, morsels, moray, eels, and, coral, groupers, plectropomus, pessuliferus, are, known, to, cooperate, with, each, other, when, hunting, grouper, are, protogynous, hermaphrodites, who, school, in, harems, that, can, vary, greatly, in, size, according, to, the, population, size, and, reef, habitat, when, no, male, is, available, in, each, school, the, largest, female, shifts, sex, to, male, if, the, final, male, disappears, changes, to, the, largest, female, occur, with, male, behavior, occurring, within, several, hours, and, sperm, production, occurring, within, ten, days, large, schools, of, forage, fish, such, as, surgeonfish, and, cardinalfish, move, around, the, reef, feeding, on, tiny, zooplankton, the, forage, fish, are, in, turn, eaten, by, larger, fish, such, as, the, bigeye, trevally, fish, receive, many, benefits, from, schooling, behaviour, including, defence, against, predators, through, better, predator, detection, since, each, fish, is, on, the, lookout, schooling, fish, have, developed, remarkable, displays, of, precise, choreography, which, confuse, and, evade, predators, for, this, they, have, evolved, special, pressure, sensors, along, their, sides, called, lateral, lines, that, let, them, feel, each, other, s, movements, and, stay, synchronized, bigeye, trevally, also, form, schools, they, are, swift, predators, who, patrol, the, reef, in, hunting, packs, when, they, find, a, school, of, forage, fish, such, as, cardinalfish, they, surround, them, and, herd, them, close, to, the, reef, this, panics, the, prey, fish, and, their, schooling, becomes, chaotic, leaving, them, open, to, attack, by, the, trevally, the, titan, triggerfish, can, move, relatively, large, rocks, when, feeding, and, is, often, followed, by, smaller, fishes, that, feed, on, leftovers, they, also, use, a, jet, of, water, to, uncover, sand, dollars, buried, in, sand, barracuda, are, ferocious, predators, on, other, fishes, with, razor, sharp, conical, teeth, which, make, it, easy, for, them, to, rip, their, prey, to, shreds, barracuda, patrol, the, outer, reef, in, large, schools, and, are, extremely, fast, swimmers, with, streamlined, torpedo, shaped, bodies, porcupinefish, are, medium, to, large, sized, and, are, usually, found, swimming, among, or, near, coral, reefs, they, inflate, their, body, by, swallowing, water, reducing, potential, predators, to, those, with, much, bigger, mouths, fish, can, not, groom, themselves, some, fish, specialise, as, cleaner, fish, and, establish, cleaning, stations, where, other, fish, can, come, to, have, their, parasites, nibbled, away, the, resident, fish, doctor, and, dentist, on, the, reef, is, the, bluestreak, cleaner, wrasse, the, bluestreak, is, marked, with, a, conspicuous, bright, blue, stripe, and, behaves, in, a, stereotypical, way, which, attracts, larger, fish, to, its, cleaning, station, as, the, bluestreak, snacks, on, the, parasites, it, gently, tickles, its, client, this, seems, to, bring, the, larger, fish, back, again, for, regular, servicing, the, reef, lizardfish, secretes, a, mucus, coating, which, reduces, drag, when, they, swim, and, also, protects, it, from, some, parasites, but, other, parasites, find, the, mucus, itself, good, to, eat, so, lizardfish, visit, the, cleaner, wrasse, which, clean, the, parasites, from, the, skin, gills, and, mouth, herbivores, feed, on, plants, the, four, largest, groups, of, coral, reef, fishes, that, feed, on, plants, are, the, parrotfishes, damselfishes, rabbitfishes, and, surgeonfishes, all, feed, primarily, on, microscopic, and, macroscopic, algae, growing, on, or, near, coral, reefs, algae, can, drape, reefs, in, kaleidoscopes, of, colours, and, shapes, algae, are, primary, producers, which, means, they, are, plants, synthesising, food, directly, from, solar, energy, and, carbon, dioxide, and, other, simple, nutrient, molecules, without, algae, everything, on, the, reef, would, die, one, important, algal, group, the, bottom, dwelling, benthic, algae, grows, over, dead, coral, and, other, inert, surfaces, and, provides, grazing, fields, for, herbivores, such, as, parrotfish, parrotfish, are, named, for, their, parrot, like, beaks, and, bright, colours, they, are, large, herbivores, that, graze, on, the, algae, that, grows, on, hard, dead, corals, equipped, with, two, pairs, of, crushing, jaws, and, their, beaks, they, pulverize, chunks, of, algae, coated, coral, digesting, the, algae, and, excreting, the, coral, as, fine, sand, smaller, parrotfish, are, relatively, defenceless, herbivores, poorly, defended, against, predators, like, barracuda, they, have, evolved, to, find, protection, by, schooling, sometimes, with, other, species, like, shoaling, rabbitfish, spinefoot, rabbitfish, are, named, for, their, defensive, venomous, spines, and, they, are, seldom, attacked, by, predators, spines, are, a, last, ditch, defence, it, is, better, to, avoid, predator, detection, in, the, first, place, and, avoid, being, thrust, into, risky, spine, to, fang, battles, so, rabbitfish, have, also, evolved, skilful, colour, changing, abilities, damselfish, are, a, group, of, species, that, feed, on, zooplankton, and, algae, and, are, an, important, reef, forage, fish, for, larger, predators, they, are, small, typically, five, centimetres, two, inches, long, many, species, are, aggressive, towards, other, fishes, which, also, graze, on, algae, such, as, surgeonfish, surgeonfish, sometimes, use, schooling, as, a, countermeasure, to, defensive, attacks, by, solitary, damselfish, symbiosis, refers, to, two, species, that, have, a, close, relationship, with, each, other, the, relationship, can, be, mutualistic, when, both, species, benefit, from, the, relationship, commensalistic, when, one, species, benefits, and, the, other, is, unaffected, and, parasitistic, when, one, species, benefits, and, the, other, is, harmed, an, example, of, commensalism, occurs, between, the, hawkfish, and, fire, coral, thanks, to, their, large, skinless, pectoral, fins, hawkfish, can, perch, on, fire, corals, without, harm, fire, corals, are, not, true, corals, but, are, hydrozoans, possessing, stinging, cells, called, nematocysts, which, would, normally, prevent, close, contact, the, protection, fire, corals, offer, hawkfish, means, the, hawkfish, has, the, high, ground, of, the, reef, and, can, safely, survey, its, surroundings, like, a, hawk, hawkfish, usually, stay, motionless, but, dart, out, and, grab, crustaceans, and, other, small, invertebrates, as, they, pass, by, they, are, mostly, solitary, although, some, species, form, pairs, and, share, a, head, of, coral, a, more, bizarre, example, of, commensalism, occurs, between, the, slim, eel, shaped, pinhead, pearlfish, and, a, particular, species, of, sea, cucumber, the, pearlfish, enters, the, sea, cucumber, through, its, anus, and, spends, the, day, safely, protected, inside, the, sea, cucumber, s, alimentary, tract, at, night, it, emerges, the, same, way, and, feeds, on, small, crustaceans, sea, anemones, are, common, on, reefs, the, tentacles, of, sea, anemones, bristle, with, tiny, harpoons, nematocysts, primed, with, toxins, and, are, an, effective, deterrent, against, most, predators, however, saddle, butterflyfish, which, are, up, to, 30, cm, 12, in, long, have, developed, a, resistance, to, these, toxins, saddle, butterflyfish, usually, flutter, gently, rather, than, swim, however, in, the, presence, of, their, preferred, food, sea, anemones, this, gentleness, disappears, and, the, butterflyfish, dash, in, and, out, ripping, off, the, anemone, tentacles, there, is, a, mutualistic, relationship, between, sea, anemones, and, clownfish, this, gives, the, sea, anemones, a, second, line, of, defence, they, are, guarded, by, fiercely, territorial, clownfish, who, are, also, immune, to, the, anemone, toxins, to, get, their, meal, butterflyfish, must, get, past, these, protective, clownfish, who, although, smaller, are, not, intimidated, an, anemone, without, its, clownfish, will, quickly, be, eaten, by, butterflyfish, in, return, the, anemones, provide, the, clownfish, protection, from, their, predators, who, are, not, immune, to, anemone, stings, as, a, further, benefit, to, the, anemone, waste, ammonia, from, the, clownfish, feed, symbiotic, algae, found, in, the, anemone, s, tentacles, as, with, all, fish, coral, reef, fish, harbour, parasites, since, coral, reef, fish, are, characterized, by, high, biodiversity, parasites, of, coral, reef, fish, show, tremendous, variety, parasites, of, coral, reef, fish, include, nematodes, platyhelminthes, cestodes, digeneans, and, monogeneans, leeches, parasitic, crustaceans, such, as, isopods, and, copepods, and, various, microorganisms, such, as, myxosporidia, and, microsporidia, some, of, these, fish, parasites, have, heteroxenous, life, cycles, i, e, they, have, several, hosts, among, which, sharks, certain, cestodes, or, molluscs, digeneans, the, high, biodiversity, of, coral, reefs, increases, the, complexity, of, the, interactions, between, parasites, and, their, various, and, numerous, hosts, numerical, estimates, of, parasite, biodiversity, have, shown, that, certain, coral, fish, species, have, up, to, 30, species, of, parasites, the, mean, number, of, parasites, per, fish, species, is, about, ten, this, has, a, consequence, in, term, of, co, extinction, results, obtained, for, the, coral, reef, fish, of, new, caledonia, suggest, that, extinction, of, a, coral, reef, fish, species, of, average, size, would, eventually, result, in, the, co, extinction, of, at, least, ten, species, of, parasites, many, reef, fish, are, toxic, toxic, fish, are, fish, which, contain, strong, toxins, in, their, bodies, there, is, a, distinction, between, poisonous, fish, and, venomous, fish, both, types, of, fish, contain, strong, toxins, but, the, difference, is, in, the, way, the, toxin, is, delivered, venomous, fish, deliver, their, toxins, called, venom, by, biting, stinging, or, stabbing, causing, an, envenomation, venomous, fish, do, not, necessarily, cause, poisoning, if, they, are, eaten, since, the, venom, is, often, destroyed, in, the, digestive, system, by, contrast, poisonous, fish, contain, strong, toxins, which, are, not, destroyed, by, the, digestive, system, this, makes, them, poisonous, to, eat, venomous, fish, carry, their, venom, in, venom, glands, and, use, various, delivery, systems, such, as, spines, or, sharp, fins, barbs, or, spikes, and, fangs, venomous, fish, tend, to, be, either, very, visible, using, flamboyant, colours, to, warn, enemies, or, skilfully, camouflaged, and, maybe, buried, in, the, sand, apart, from, the, defence, or, hunting, value, venom, might, have, value, for, bottom, dwelling, fish, by, killing, the, bacteria, that, try, to, invade, their, skin, few, of, these, venoms, have, been, studied, they, are, a, yet, to, be, tapped, resource, for, bioprospecting, to, find, drugs, with, medical, uses, the, most, venomous, known, fish, is, the, reef, stonefish, it, has, a, remarkable, ability, to, camouflage, itself, amongst, rocks, it, is, an, ambush, predator, that, sits, on, the, bottom, waiting, for, prey, to, come, close, it, does, not, swim, away, if, disturbed, but, erects, 13, venomous, spines, along, its, back, for, defence, it, can, shoot, venom, from, each, or, all, of, these, spines, each, spine, is, like, a, hypodermic, needle, delivering, the, venom, from, two, sacs, attached, to, the, spine, the, stonefish, has, control, over, whether, to, shoot, its, venom, and, does, so, when, provoked, or, frightened, the, venom, results, in, severe, pain, paralysis, and, tissue, death, and, can, be, fatal, if, not, treated, despite, its, formidable, defence, the, stonefish, does, have, predators, some, bottom, feeding, rays, and, sharks, with, crushing, teeth, feed, on, them, as, does, the, stokes, seasnake, unlike, the, stonefish, which, can, shoot, venom, the, lionfish, can, only, release, venom, when, something, strikes, its, spines, although, not, native, to, the, us, coast, lionfish, have, appeared, around, florida, and, have, spread, up, the, coast, to, new, york, they, are, attractive, aquarium, fish, sometimes, used, to, stock, ponds, and, may, have, been, washed, into, the, sea, during, a, hurricane, lionfish, can, aggressively, dart, at, scuba, divers, and, attempt, to, puncture, the, facemask, with, their, venomous, spines, the, spotted, trunkfish, is, a, reef, fish, which, secretes, a, colourless, ciguatera, toxin, from, glands, on, its, skin, when, touched, the, toxin, is, only, dangerous, when, ingested, so, there, s, no, immediate, harm, to, divers, however, predators, as, large, as, nurse, sharks, can, die, as, a, result, of, eating, a, trunkfish, ciguatera, toxins, appear, to, accumulate, in, top, predators, of, coral, reefs, many, of, the, caribbean, groupers, and, the, barracuda, for, example, may, contain, enough, of, this, toxin, to, cause, severe, symptoms, in, humans, who, eat, them, what, makes, the, situation, particularly, dangerous, is, that, such, species, may, be, toxic, only, at, certain, sizes, or, locations, making, it, difficult, to, know, whether, or, when, they, are, or, are, not, safe, to, eat, in, some, locations, this, leads, to, many, cases, of, ciguatera, poisoning, among, tropical, islanders, the, stargazer, buries, itself, in, sand, and, can, deliver, electric, shocks, as, well, as, venom, it, is, a, delicacy, in, some, cultures, the, venom, is, destroyed, when, it, is, cooked, and, can, be, found, for, sale, in, some, fish, markets, with, the, electric, organ, removed, they, have, been, called, the, meanest, things, in, creation, the, giant, moray, is, a, reef, fish, at, the, top, of, the, food, chain, like, many, other, apex, reef, fish, it, is, likely, to, cause, ciguatera, poisoning, if, eaten, outbreaks, of, ciguatera, poisoning, in, the, 11th, to, 15th, centuries, from, large, carnivorous, reef, fish, caused, by, harmful, algal, blooms, could, be, a, reason, why, polynesians, migrated, to, easter, island, new, zealand, and, possibly, hawaii, whitetip, blacktip, and, grey, reef, sharks, dominate, the, ecosystems, of, coral, reefs, in, the, indo, pacific, coral, reefs, in, the, western, atlantic, ocean, are, dominated, by, the, caribbean, reef, shark, these, sharks, all, species, of, requiem, shark, all, have, the, robust, streamlined, bodies, typical, of, the, requiem, shark, as, fast, swimming, agile, predators, they, feed, primarily, on, free, swimming, bony, fishes, and, cephalopods, other, species, of, reef, sharks, include, the, galapagos, shark, the, tawny, nurse, shark, and, hammerheads, the, whitetip, reef, shark, is, a, small, shark, usually, less, than, 1, 6, m, 5, 2, ft, in, length, it, is, found, almost, exclusively, around, coral, reefs, where, it, can, be, encountered, around, coral, heads, and, ledges, with, high, vertical, relief, or, over, sandy, flats, in, lagoons, or, near, drop, offs, to, deeper, water, whitetips, prefer, very, clear, water, and, rarely, swim, far, from, the, bottom, they, spend, most, of, the, daytime, resting, inside, caves, unlike, other, requiem, sharks, which, usually, rely, on, ram, ventilation, and, must, constantly, swim, to, breathe, these, sharks, can, pump, water, over, their, gills, and, lie, still, on, the, bottom, they, have, slender, lithe, bodies, which, allow, them, to, wriggle, into, crevices, and, holes, and, extract, prey, inaccessible, to, other, reef, sharks, on, the, other, hand, they, are, rather, clumsy, when, attempting, to, take, food, suspended, in, open, water, whitetip, reef, sharks, do, not, frequent, very, shallow, water, like, the, blacktip, reef, shark, nor, the, outer, reef, like, the, grey, reef, shark, they, generally, remain, within, a, highly, localized, area, an, individual, shark, may, use, the, same, cave, for, months, to, years, the, daytime, home, range, of, a, whitetip, reef, shark, is, limited, to, about, 0, 05, km, 2, 0, 019, sq, mi, at, night, this, range, increases, to, 1, km, 2, 0, 39, sq, mi, the, whitetip, reef, shark, is, highly, responsive, to, olfactory, acoustic, and, electrical, cues, given, off, by, potential, prey, its, visual, system, is, attuned, more, to, movement, and, or, contrast, than, to, object, details, it, is, especially, sensitive, to, natural, and, artificial, low, frequency, sounds, in, the, 25, 100, hz, range, which, evoke, struggling, fish, whitetips, hunt, primarily, at, night, when, many, fishes, are, asleep, and, easily, taken, after, dusk, a, group, of, sharks, may, target, the, same, prey, item, covering, every, exit, route, from, a, particular, coral, head, each, shark, hunts, for, itself, and, in, competition, with, the, others, in, its, group, they, feed, mainly, on, bony, fishes, including, eels, squirrelfishes, snappers, damselfishes, parrotfishes, surgeonfishes, triggerfishes, and, goatfishes, as, well, as, octopus, spiny, lobsters, and, crabs, important, predators, of, the, whitetip, reef, shark, include, tiger, sharks, and, galapagos, sharks, the, blacktip, reef, shark, is, typically, about, 1, 6, m, 5, 2, ft, long, it, is, usually, found, over, reef, ledges, and, sandy, flats, though, it, can, also, enter, brackish, and, freshwater, environments, this, species, likes, shallow, water, while, the, whitetip, and, the, grey, reef, shark, are, prefer, deeper, water, younger, sharks, favour, shallow, sandy, flats, and, older, sharks, spend, more, time, around, reef, ledges, and, near, reef, drop, offs, blacktip, reef, sharks, are, strongly, attached, to, their, own, area, where, they, may, remain, for, up, to, several, years, a, tracking, study, off, palmyra, atoll, in, the, central, pacific, has, found, that, the, blacktip, reef, shark, had, a, home, range, of, about, 0, 55, km, 2, 0, 21, sq, mi, among, the, smallest, of, any, shark, species, the, size, and, location, of, the, range, does, not, change, with, time, of, day, the, blacktip, reef, shark, swims, alone, or, in, small, groups, large, social, aggregations, have, also, been, observed, they, are, active, predators, of, small, bony, fishes, cephalopods, and, crustaceans, and, also, feed, on, sea, snakes, and, seabirds, blacktip, reef, sharks, are, preyed, on, by, groupers, grey, reef, sharks, tiger, sharks, and, members, of, their, own, species, at, palmyra, atoll, adult, blacktip, reef, sharks, avoid, patrolling, tiger, sharks, by, staying, out, of, the, central, deeper, lagoon, grey, reef, sharks, are, usually, less, than, 1, 9, metres, 6, 2, ft, long, despite, their, moderate, size, grey, reef, sharks, actively, expel, most, other, shark, species, from, favored, habitats, in, areas, where, this, species, co, exists, with, the, blacktip, reef, shark, the, latter, species, occupy, the, shallow, flats, while, the, grey, reef, sharks, stay, in, deeper, water, many, grey, reef, sharks, have, a, home, range, on, a, specific, area, of, the, reef, to, which, they, continually, return, however, they, are, social, rather, than, territorial, during, the, day, these, sharks, often, form, groups, of, 5, 20, individuals, near, coral, reef, drop, offs, splitting, up, in, the, evening, as, the, sharks, begin, to, hunt, they, are, found, over, continental, and, insular, shelves, preferring, the, leeward, away, from, the, direction, of, the, current, sides, of, coral, reefs, with, clear, water, and, rugged, topography, they, are, frequently, found, near, the, drop, offs, at, the, outer, edges, of, the, reef, and, less, commonly, within, lagoons, on, occasion, this, shark, may, venture, several, kilometers, out, into, the, open, ocean, shark, researcher, leonard, compagno, comments, on, the, relationship, between, the, three, species, shows, microhabitat, separation, from, the, blacktip, reef, sharks, around, islands, where, both, species, occur, the, blacktip, occupies, shallow, flats, while, the, grey, reef, shark, is, usually, found, in, deeper, areas, but, where, the, blacktip, is, absent, the, grey, reef, shark, is, commonly, found, on, the, flats, complements, the, whitetip, shark, as, it, is, far, more, adapt, at, catching, off, bottom, fish, than, the, whitetip, but, the, later, is, far, more, competent, in, extracting, prey, from, crevices, and, holes, in, reefs, the, caribbean, reef, shark, is, up, to, 3, metres, 10, ft, long, one, of, the, largest, apex, predators, in, the, reef, ecosystem, like, the, whitetip, reef, shark, they, have, been, documented, resting, motionless, on, the, sea, bottom, or, inside, caves, unusual, behaviour, for, requiem, sharks, caribbean, reef, sharks, play, a, major, role, in, shaping, caribbean, reef, communities, they, are, more, active, at, night, with, no, evidence, of, seasonal, changes, in, activity, or, migration, juveniles, tend, to, remain, in, a, localized, area, throughout, the, year, while, adults, range, over, a, wider, area, the, caribbean, reef, shark, feeds, on, a, wide, variety, of, reef, dwelling, bony, fishes, and, cephalopods, as, well, as, some, elasmobranchs, such, as, eagle, rays, and, yellow, stingrays, young, sharks, feed, on, small, fishes, shrimps, and, crabs, in, turn, young, sharks, are, preyed, on, by, larger, sharks, such, as, the, tiger, shark, and, the, bull, shark
