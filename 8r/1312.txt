preventive, healthcare, or, prophylaxis, is, the, application, of, healthcare, measures, to, prevent, diseases, disease, and, disability, are, affected, by, environmental, factors, genetic, predisposition, disease, agents, and, lifestyle, choices, and, are, dynamic, processes, that, begin, before, individuals, realize, they, are, affected, disease, prevention, relies, on, anticipatory, actions, that, can, be, categorized, as, primal, primary, secondary, and, tertiary, prevention, each, year, millions, of, people, die, of, preventable, causes, a, 2004, study, showed, that, about, half, of, all, deaths, in, the, united, states, in, 2000, were, due, to, preventable, behaviors, and, exposures, leading, causes, included, cardiovascular, disease, chronic, respiratory, disease, unintentional, injuries, diabetes, and, certain, infectious, diseases, this, same, study, estimates, that, 400, 000, people, die, each, year, in, the, united, states, due, to, poor, diet, and, a, sedentary, lifestyle, according, to, estimates, made, by, the, world, health, organization, who, about, 55, million, people, died, worldwide, in, 2011, and, two, thirds, of, these, died, from, non, communicable, diseases, including, cancer, diabetes, and, chronic, cardiovascular, and, lung, diseases, this, is, an, increase, from, the, year, 2000, during, which, 60, of, deaths, were, attributed, to, these, diseases, preventive, healthcare, is, especially, important, given, the, worldwide, rise, in, the, prevalence, of, chronic, diseases, and, deaths, from, these, diseases, there, are, many, methods, for, prevention, of, disease, one, of, them, is, prevention, of, teenage, smoking, through, information, giving, it, is, recommended, that, adults, and, children, aim, to, visit, their, doctor, for, regular, check, ups, even, if, they, feel, healthy, to, perform, disease, screening, identify, risk, factors, for, disease, discuss, tips, for, a, healthy, and, balanced, lifestyle, stay, up, to, date, with, immunizations, and, boosters, and, maintain, a, good, relationship, with, a, healthcare, provider, in, pediatrics, some, common, examples, of, primary, prevention, are, encouraging, parents, to, turn, down, the, temperature, of, their, home, water, heater, in, order, to, avoid, scalding, burns, encouraging, children, to, wear, bicycle, helmets, and, suggesting, that, people, use, the, air, quality, index, aqi, to, check, the, level, of, pollution, in, the, outside, air, before, engaging, in, sporting, activities, some, common, disease, screenings, include, checking, for, hypertension, high, blood, pressure, hyperglycemia, high, blood, sugar, a, risk, factor, for, diabetes, mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, high, blood, cholesterol, screening, for, colon, cancer, depression, hiv, and, other, common, types, of, sexually, transmitted, disease, such, as, chlamydia, syphilis, and, gonorrhea, mammography, to, screen, for, breast, cancer, colorectal, cancer, screening, a, pap, test, to, check, for, cervical, cancer, and, screening, for, osteoporosis, genetic, testing, can, also, be, performed, to, screen, for, mutations, that, cause, genetic, disorders, or, predisposition, to, certain, diseases, such, as, breast, or, ovarian, cancer, however, these, measures, are, not, affordable, for, every, individual, and, the, cost, effectiveness, of, preventive, healthcare, is, still, a, topic, of, debate, preventive, healthcare, strategies, are, described, as, taking, place, at, the, primal, primary, secondary, and, tertiary, prevention, levels, although, advocated, as, preventive, medicine, in, the, early, twentieth, century, by, sara, josephine, baker, in, the, 1940s, hugh, r, leavell, and, e, gurney, clark, coined, the, term, primary, prevention, they, worked, at, the, harvard, and, columbia, university, schools, of, public, health, respectively, and, later, expanded, the, levels, to, include, secondary, and, tertiary, prevention, goldston, 1987, notes, that, these, levels, might, be, better, described, as, prevention, treatment, and, rehabilitation, although, the, terms, primary, secondary, and, tertiary, prevention, are, still, in, use, today, the, concept, of, primal, prevention, has, been, created, much, more, recently, in, relation, to, the, new, developments, in, molecular, biology, over, the, last, fifty, years, more, particularly, in, epigenetics, which, point, to, the, paramount, importance, of, environmental, conditions, both, physical, and, affective, on, the, organism, during, its, fetal, and, newborn, life, or, so, called, primal, period, of, life, primal, prevention, has, been, propounded, as, a, separate, category, of, health, promotion, based, on, the, evidence, that, epigenetic, processes, start, at, conception, see, below, primal, and, primordial, preventions, primordial, prevention, refers, to, measures, designed, to, avoid, the, development, of, risk, factors, in, the, first, place, early, in, life, primal, prevention, is, health, promotion, par, excellence, new, knowledge, in, molecular, biology, in, particular, epigenetics, points, to, how, much, affective, as, well, as, physical, environment, during, fetal, and, newborn, life, may, determine, adult, health, this, way, of, promoting, health, consists, mainly, in, providing, future, parents, with, pertinent, unbiased, information, on, primal, health, and, supporting, them, during, their, child, s, primal, period, of, life, i, e, from, conception, to, first, anniversary, according, to, definition, by, the, primal, health, research, centre, london, this, includes, adequate, parental, leave, ideally, for, both, parents, with, kin, caregiving, and, financial, help, where, needed, primordial, prevention, refers, to, all, measures, designed, to, prevent, the, development, of, risk, factors, in, the, first, place, early, in, life, and, even, preconception, as, ruth, a, etzel, has, described, it, all, population, level, actions, and, measures, that, inhibit, the, emergence, and, establishment, of, adverse, environmental, economic, and, social, conditions, this, could, be, reducing, air, pollution, or, prohibiting, endocrine, disrupting, chemicals, in, food, handling, equipment, and, food, contact, materials, primary, prevention, consists, of, traditional, health, promotion, and, specific, protection, health, promotion, activities, include, prevention, strategies, such, as, health, education, and, lifestyle, medicine, and, are, current, non, clinical, life, choices, such, as, eating, nutritious, meals, and, exercising, often, that, prevent, lifestyle, related, medical, conditions, improve, the, quality, of, life, and, create, a, sense, of, overall, well, being, preventing, disease, and, creating, overall, well, being, prolongs, life, expectancy, health, promotional, activities, do, not, target, a, specific, disease, or, condition, but, rather, promote, health, and, well, being, on, a, very, general, level, on, the, other, hand, specific, protection, targets, a, type, or, group, of, diseases, and, complements, the, goals, of, health, promotion, food, is, the, most, basic, tool, in, preventive, health, care, poor, nutrition, is, linked, to, various, chronic, illnesses, because, of, this, having, a, healthy, diet, and, proper, nutrition, can, be, used, to, prevent, illnesses, the, 2011, national, health, interview, survey, performed, by, the, centers, for, disease, control, was, the, first, national, survey, to, include, questions, about, ability, to, pay, for, food, difficulty, with, paying, for, food, medicine, or, both, is, a, problem, facing, 1, out, of, 3, americans, if, better, food, options, were, available, through, food, banks, soup, kitchens, and, other, resources, for, low, income, people, obesity, and, the, chronic, conditions, that, come, along, with, it, would, be, better, controlled, a, food, desert, is, an, area, with, restricted, access, to, healthy, foods, due, to, a, lack, of, supermarkets, within, a, reasonable, distance, these, are, often, low, income, neighborhoods, with, the, majority, of, residents, lacking, transportation, there, have, been, several, grassroots, movements, since, 1995, to, encourage, urban, gardening, using, vacant, lots, to, grow, food, cultivated, by, local, residents, mobile, fresh, markets, are, another, resource, for, residents, in, a, food, desert, which, are, specially, outfitted, buses, bringing, affordable, fresh, fruits, and, vegetables, to, low, income, neighborhoods, it, has, been, proposed, that, healthy, longevity, diets, are, included, in, standard, healthcare, as, switching, from, a, typical, western, diet, could, often, extend, life, by, a, decade, specific, protective, measures, such, as, water, purification, sewage, treatment, and, the, development, of, personal, hygienic, routines, such, as, regular, hand, washing, safe, sex, to, prevent, sexually, transmitted, infections, became, mainstream, upon, the, discovery, of, infectious, disease, agents, and, have, decreased, the, rates, of, communicable, diseases, which, are, spread, in, unsanitary, conditions, scientific, advancements, in, genetics, have, contributed, to, the, knowledge, of, hereditary, diseases, and, have, facilitated, progress, in, specific, protective, measures, in, individuals, who, are, carriers, of, a, disease, gene, or, have, an, increased, predisposition, to, a, specific, disease, genetic, testing, has, allowed, physicians, to, make, quicker, and, more, accurate, diagnoses, and, has, allowed, for, tailored, treatments, or, personalized, medicine, food, safety, has, a, significant, impact, on, human, health, and, food, quality, monitoring, has, increased, water, including, drinking, water, is, also, monitored, in, many, cases, for, securing, health, there, also, is, some, monitoring, of, air, pollution, in, many, cases, environmental, standards, such, as, via, maximum, pollution, levels, regulation, of, chemicals, occupational, hygiene, requirements, or, consumer, protection, regulations, establish, some, protection, in, combination, with, the, monitoring, preventive, measures, like, vaccines, and, medical, screenings, are, also, important, using, ppe, properly, and, getting, the, recommended, vaccines, and, screenings, can, help, decrease, the, spread, of, respiratory, diseases, protecting, the, healthcare, workers, as, well, as, their, patients, secondary, prevention, deals, with, latent, diseases, and, attempts, to, prevent, an, asymptomatic, disease, from, progressing, to, symptomatic, disease, certain, diseases, can, be, classified, as, primary, or, secondary, this, depends, on, definitions, of, what, constitutes, a, disease, though, in, general, primary, prevention, addresses, the, root, cause, of, a, disease, or, injury, whereas, secondary, prevention, aims, to, detect, and, treat, a, disease, early, on, secondary, prevention, consists, of, early, diagnosis, and, prompt, treatment, to, contain, the, disease, and, prevent, its, spread, to, other, individuals, and, disability, limitation, to, prevent, potential, future, complications, and, disabilities, from, the, disease, early, diagnosis, and, prompt, treatment, for, a, syphilis, patient, would, include, a, course, of, antibiotics, to, destroy, the, pathogen, and, screening, and, treatment, of, any, infants, born, to, syphilitic, mothers, disability, limitation, for, syphilitic, patients, includes, continued, check, ups, on, the, heart, cerebrospinal, fluid, and, central, nervous, system, of, patients, to, curb, any, damaging, effects, such, as, blindness, or, paralysis, finally, tertiary, prevention, attempts, to, reduce, the, damage, caused, by, symptomatic, disease, by, focusing, on, mental, physical, and, social, rehabilitation, unlike, secondary, prevention, which, aims, to, prevent, disability, the, objective, of, tertiary, prevention, is, to, maximize, the, remaining, capabilities, and, functions, of, an, already, disabled, patient, goals, of, tertiary, prevention, include, preventing, pain, and, damage, halting, progression, and, complications, from, disease, and, restoring, the, health, and, functions, of, the, individuals, affected, by, disease, for, syphilitic, patients, rehabilitation, includes, measures, to, prevent, complete, disability, from, the, disease, such, as, implementing, work, place, adjustments, for, the, blind, and, paralyzed, or, providing, counseling, to, restore, normal, daily, functions, to, the, greatest, extent, possible, the, general, use, of, machinery, that, has, adequate, ventilation, and, airflow, is, suggested, for, these, patients, in, order, to, halt, progression, and, complications, of, disease, a, study, conducted, in, nursing, homes, to, prevent, diseases, concluded, that, the, use, of, evaporative, humidifiers, to, maintain, the, indoor, humidity, within, the, range, 40, 60, can, reduce, respiratory, risk, certain, diseases, thrive, in, different, humidities, so, the, use, of, the, humidifiers, can, help, kill, the, particles, of, diseases, the, leading, preventable, cause, of, death, in, the, united, states, is, tobacco, however, poor, diet, and, lack, of, exercise, may, soon, surpass, tobacco, as, a, leading, cause, of, death, these, behaviors, are, modifiable, and, public, health, and, prevention, efforts, could, make, a, difference, to, reduce, these, deaths, the, leading, causes, of, preventable, death, worldwide, share, similar, trends, to, the, united, states, there, are, a, few, differences, between, the, two, such, as, malnutrition, pollution, and, unsafe, sanitation, that, reflect, health, disparities, between, the, developing, and, developed, world, however, several, of, the, leading, causes, of, death, or, underlying, contributors, to, earlier, death, may, not, be, included, as, preventable, causes, of, death, a, study, concluded, that, pollution, was, responsible, for, approximately, 9, million, deaths, per, year, in, 2019, and, another, study, concluded, that, the, global, mean, loss, of, life, expectancy, a, measure, similar, to, years, of, potential, life, lost, from, air, pollution, in, 2015, was, 2, 9, years, substantially, more, than, for, example, 0, 3, years, from, all, forms, of, direct, violence, albeit, a, significant, fraction, of, the, lle, is, considered, to, be, unavoidable, such, as, pollution, from, some, natural, wildfires, a, landmark, study, conducted, by, the, world, health, organization, and, the, international, labour, organization, found, that, exposure, to, long, working, hours, is, the, occupational, risk, factor, with, the, largest, attributable, burden, of, disease, i, e, an, estimated, 745, 000, fatalities, from, ischemic, heart, disease, and, stroke, events, in, 2016, with, this, study, prevention, of, exposure, to, long, working, hours, has, emerged, as, a, priority, for, prevention, healthcare, in, workplace, settings, in, 2010, 7, 6, million, children, died, before, reaching, the, age, of, 5, while, this, is, a, decrease, from, 9, 6, million, in, 2000, it, was, still, far, from, the, fourth, millennium, development, goal, to, decrease, child, mortality, by, two, thirds, by, 2015, of, these, deaths, about, 64, were, due, to, infection, including, diarrhea, pneumonia, and, malaria, about, 40, of, these, deaths, occurred, in, neonates, children, ages, 1, 28, days, due, to, pre, term, birth, complications, the, highest, number, of, child, deaths, occurred, in, africa, and, southeast, asia, as, of, 2015, in, africa, almost, no, progress, has, been, made, in, reducing, neonatal, death, since, 1990, in, 2010, india, nigeria, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, pakistan, and, china, contributed, to, almost, 50, of, global, child, deaths, targeting, efforts, in, these, countries, is, essential, to, reducing, the, global, child, death, rate, child, mortality, is, caused, by, factors, including, poverty, environmental, hazards, and, lack, of, maternal, education, in, 2003, the, world, health, organization, created, a, list, of, interventions, in, the, following, table, that, were, judged, economically, and, operationally, feasible, based, on, the, healthcare, resources, and, infrastructure, in, 42, nations, that, contribute, to, 90, of, all, infant, and, child, deaths, the, table, indicates, how, many, infant, and, child, deaths, could, have, been, prevented, in, 2000, assuming, universal, healthcare, coverage, obesity, is, a, major, risk, factor, for, a, wide, variety, of, conditions, including, cardiovascular, diseases, hypertension, certain, cancers, and, type, 2, diabetes, in, order, to, prevent, obesity, it, is, recommended, that, individuals, adhere, to, a, consistent, exercise, regimen, as, well, as, a, nutritious, and, balanced, diet, a, healthy, individual, should, aim, for, acquiring, 10, of, their, energy, from, proteins, 15, 20, from, fat, and, over, 50, from, complex, carbohydrates, while, avoiding, alcohol, as, well, as, foods, high, in, fat, salt, and, sugar, sedentary, adults, should, aim, for, at, least, half, an, hour, of, moderate, level, daily, physical, activity, and, eventually, increase, to, include, at, least, 20, minutes, of, intense, exercise, three, times, a, week, preventive, health, care, offers, many, benefits, to, those, that, chose, to, participate, in, taking, an, active, role, in, the, culture, the, medical, system, in, our, society, is, geared, toward, curing, acute, symptoms, of, disease, after, the, fact, that, they, have, brought, us, into, the, emergency, room, an, ongoing, epidemic, within, american, culture, is, the, prevalence, of, obesity, healthy, eating, and, regular, exercise, play, a, significant, role, in, reducing, an, individual, s, risk, for, type, 2, diabetes, a, 2008, study, concluded, that, about, 23, 6, million, people, in, the, united, states, had, diabetes, including, 5, 7, million, that, had, not, been, diagnosed, 90, to, 95, percent, of, people, with, diabetes, have, type, 2, diabetes, diabetes, is, the, main, cause, of, kidney, failure, limb, amputation, and, new, onset, blindness, in, american, adults, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, such, as, syphilis, and, hiv, are, common, but, preventable, with, safe, sex, practices, stis, can, be, asymptomatic, or, cause, a, range, of, symptoms, preventive, measures, for, stis, are, called, prophylactics, the, term, especially, applies, to, the, use, of, condoms, which, are, highly, effective, at, preventing, disease, but, also, to, other, devices, meant, to, prevent, stis, such, as, dental, dams, and, latex, gloves, other, means, for, preventing, stis, include, education, on, how, to, use, condoms, or, other, such, barrier, devices, testing, partners, before, having, unprotected, sex, receiving, regular, sti, screenings, to, both, receive, treatment, and, prevent, spreading, stis, to, partners, and, specifically, for, hiv, regularly, taking, prophylactic, antiretroviral, drugs, such, as, truvada, post, exposure, prophylaxis, started, within, 72, hours, optimally, less, than, 1, hour, after, exposure, to, high, risk, fluids, can, also, protect, against, hiv, transmission, genetically, modified, mosquitoes, are, being, used, in, developing, countries, to, control, malaria, this, approach, has, been, subject, to, objections, and, controversy, thrombosis, is, a, serious, circulatory, disease, affecting, thousands, usually, older, persons, undergoing, surgical, procedures, women, taking, oral, contraceptives, and, travelers, the, consequences, of, thrombosis, can, be, heart, attacks, and, strokes, prevention, can, include, exercise, anti, embolism, stockings, pneumatic, devices, and, pharmacological, treatments, in, recent, years, cancer, has, become, a, global, problem, low, and, middle, income, countries, share, a, majority, of, the, cancer, burden, largely, due, to, exposure, to, carcinogens, resulting, from, industrialization, and, globalization, however, primary, prevention, of, cancer, and, knowledge, of, cancer, risk, factors, can, reduce, over, one, third, of, all, cancer, cases, primary, prevention, of, cancer, can, also, prevent, other, diseases, both, communicable, and, non, communicable, that, share, common, risk, factors, with, cancer, lung, cancer, is, the, leading, cause, of, cancer, related, deaths, in, the, united, states, and, europe, and, is, a, major, cause, of, death, in, other, countries, tobacco, is, an, environmental, carcinogen, and, the, major, underlying, cause, of, lung, cancer, between, 25, and, 40, of, all, cancer, deaths, and, about, 90, of, lung, cancer, cases, are, associated, with, tobacco, use, other, carcinogens, include, asbestos, and, radioactive, materials, both, smoking, and, second, hand, exposure, from, other, smokers, can, lead, to, lung, cancer, and, eventually, death, prevention, of, tobacco, use, is, paramount, to, prevention, of, lung, cancer, individual, community, and, statewide, interventions, can, prevent, or, cease, tobacco, use, 90, of, adults, in, the, u, s, who, have, ever, smoked, did, so, prior, to, the, age, of, 20, in, school, prevention, educational, programs, as, well, as, counseling, resources, can, help, prevent, and, cease, adolescent, smoking, other, cessation, techniques, include, group, support, programs, nicotine, replacement, therapy, nrt, hypnosis, and, self, motivated, behavioral, change, studies, have, shown, long, term, success, rates, 1, year, of, 20, for, hypnosis, and, 10, 20, for, group, therapy, cancer, screening, programs, serve, as, effective, sources, of, secondary, prevention, the, mayo, clinic, johns, hopkins, and, memorial, sloan, kettering, hospitals, conducted, annual, x, ray, screenings, and, sputum, cytology, tests, and, found, that, lung, cancer, was, detected, at, higher, rates, earlier, stages, and, had, more, favorable, treatment, outcomes, which, supports, widespread, investment, in, such, programs, legislation, can, also, affect, smoking, prevention, and, cessation, in, 1992, massachusetts, united, states, voters, passed, a, bill, adding, an, extra, 25, cent, tax, to, each, pack, of, cigarettes, despite, intense, lobbying, and, 7, 3, million, spent, by, the, tobacco, industry, to, oppose, this, bill, tax, revenue, goes, toward, tobacco, education, and, control, programs, and, has, led, to, a, decline, of, tobacco, use, in, the, state, lung, cancer, and, tobacco, smoking, are, increasing, worldwide, especially, in, china, china, is, responsible, for, about, one, third, of, the, global, consumption, and, production, of, tobacco, products, tobacco, control, policies, have, been, ineffective, as, china, is, home, to, 350, million, regular, smokers, and, 750, million, passive, smokers, and, the, annual, death, toll, is, over, 1, million, recommended, actions, to, reduce, tobacco, use, include, decreasing, tobacco, supply, increasing, tobacco, taxes, widespread, educational, campaigns, decreasing, advertising, from, the, tobacco, industry, and, increasing, tobacco, cessation, support, resources, in, wuhan, china, a, 1998, school, based, program, implemented, an, anti, tobacco, curriculum, for, adolescents, and, reduced, the, number, of, regular, smokers, though, it, did, not, significantly, decrease, the, number, of, adolescents, who, initiated, smoking, this, program, was, therefore, effective, in, secondary, but, not, primary, prevention, and, shows, that, school, based, programs, have, the, potential, to, reduce, tobacco, use, skin, cancer, is, the, most, common, cancer, in, the, united, states, the, most, lethal, form, of, skin, cancer, melanoma, leads, to, over, 50, 000, annual, deaths, in, the, united, states, childhood, prevention, is, particularly, important, because, a, significant, portion, of, ultraviolet, radiation, exposure, from, the, sun, occurs, during, childhood, and, adolescence, and, can, subsequently, lead, to, skin, cancer, in, adulthood, furthermore, childhood, prevention, can, lead, to, the, development, of, healthy, habits, that, continue, to, prevent, cancer, for, a, lifetime, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, recommends, several, primary, prevention, methods, including, limiting, sun, exposure, between, 10, am, and, 4, pm, when, the, sun, is, strongest, wearing, tighter, weave, natural, cotton, clothing, wide, brim, hats, and, sunglasses, as, protective, covers, using, sunscreens, that, protect, against, both, uv, a, and, uv, b, rays, and, avoiding, tanning, salons, sunscreen, should, be, reapplied, after, sweating, exposure, to, water, through, swimming, for, example, or, after, several, hours, of, sun, exposure, since, skin, cancer, is, very, preventable, the, cdc, recommends, school, level, prevention, programs, including, preventive, curricula, family, involvement, participation, and, support, from, the, school, s, health, services, and, partnership, with, community, state, and, national, agencies, and, organizations, to, keep, children, away, from, excessive, uv, radiation, exposure, most, skin, cancer, and, sun, protection, data, comes, from, australia, and, the, united, states, an, international, study, reported, that, australians, tended, to, demonstrate, higher, knowledge, of, sun, protection, and, skin, cancer, knowledge, compared, to, other, countries, of, children, adolescents, and, adults, sunscreen, was, the, most, commonly, used, skin, protection, however, many, adolescents, purposely, used, sunscreen, with, a, low, sun, protection, factor, spf, in, order, to, get, a, tan, various, australian, studies, have, shown, that, many, adults, failed, to, use, sunscreen, correctly, many, applied, sunscreen, well, after, their, initial, sun, exposure, and, or, failed, to, reapply, when, necessary, a, 2002, case, control, study, in, brazil, showed, that, only, 3, of, case, participants, and, 11, of, control, participants, used, sunscreen, with, spf, 15, cervical, cancer, ranks, among, the, top, three, most, common, cancers, among, women, in, latin, america, sub, saharan, africa, and, parts, of, asia, cervical, cytology, screening, aims, to, detect, abnormal, lesions, in, the, cervix, so, that, women, can, undergo, treatment, prior, to, the, development, of, cancer, given, that, high, quality, screening, and, follow, up, care, has, been, shown, to, reduce, cervical, cancer, rates, by, up, to, 80, most, developed, countries, now, encourage, sexually, active, women, to, undergo, a, pap, test, every, 3, 5, years, finland, and, iceland, have, developed, effective, organized, programs, with, routine, monitoring, and, have, managed, to, significantly, reduce, cervical, cancer, mortality, while, using, fewer, resources, than, unorganized, opportunistic, programs, such, as, those, in, the, united, states, or, canada, in, developing, nations, in, latin, america, such, as, chile, colombia, costa, rica, and, cuba, both, public, and, privately, organized, programs, have, offered, women, routine, cytological, screening, since, the, 1970s, however, these, efforts, have, not, resulted, in, a, significant, change, in, cervical, cancer, incidence, or, mortality, in, these, nations, this, is, likely, due, to, low, quality, inefficient, testing, however, puerto, rico, which, has, offered, early, screening, since, the, 1960s, has, witnessed, almost, a, 50, decline, in, cervical, cancer, incidence, and, almost, a, four, fold, decrease, in, mortality, between, 1950, and, 1990, brazil, peru, india, and, several, high, risk, nations, in, sub, saharan, africa, which, lack, organized, screening, programs, have, a, high, incidence, of, cervical, cancer, colorectal, cancer, is, globally, the, second, most, common, cancer, in, women, and, the, third, most, common, in, men, and, the, fourth, most, common, cause, of, cancer, death, after, lung, stomach, and, liver, cancer, having, caused, 715, 000, deaths, in, 2010, it, is, also, highly, preventable, about, 80, percent, of, colorectal, cancers, begin, as, benign, growths, commonly, called, polyps, which, can, be, easily, detected, and, removed, during, a, colonoscopy, other, methods, of, screening, for, polyps, and, cancers, include, fecal, occult, blood, testing, lifestyle, changes, that, may, reduce, the, risk, of, colorectal, cancer, include, increasing, consumption, of, whole, grains, fruits, and, vegetables, and, reducing, consumption, of, red, meat, access, to, healthcare, and, preventive, health, services, is, unequal, as, is, the, quality, of, care, received, a, study, conducted, by, the, agency, for, healthcare, research, and, quality, ahrq, revealed, health, disparities, in, the, united, states, in, the, united, states, elderly, adults, 65, years, old, received, worse, care, and, had, less, access, to, care, than, their, younger, counterparts, the, same, trends, are, seen, when, comparing, all, racial, minorities, black, hispanic, asian, to, white, patients, and, low, income, people, to, high, income, people, common, barriers, to, accessing, and, utilizing, healthcare, resources, included, lack, of, income, and, education, language, barriers, and, lack, of, health, insurance, minorities, were, less, likely, than, whites, to, possess, health, insurance, as, were, individuals, who, completed, less, education, these, disparities, made, it, more, difficult, for, the, disadvantaged, groups, to, have, regular, access, to, a, primary, care, provider, receive, immunizations, or, receive, other, types, of, medical, care, additionally, uninsured, people, tend, to, not, seek, care, until, their, diseases, progress, to, chronic, and, serious, states, and, they, are, also, more, likely, to, forgo, necessary, tests, treatments, and, filling, prescription, medications, these, sorts, of, disparities, and, barriers, exist, worldwide, as, well, often, there, are, decades, of, gaps, in, life, expectancy, between, developing, and, developed, countries, for, example, japan, has, an, average, life, expectancy, that, is, 36, years, greater, than, that, in, malawi, low, income, countries, also, tend, to, have, fewer, physicians, than, high, income, countries, in, nigeria, and, myanmar, there, are, fewer, than, 4, physicians, per, 100, 000, people, while, norway, and, switzerland, have, a, ratio, that, is, ten, fold, higher, common, barriers, worldwide, include, lack, of, availability, of, health, services, and, healthcare, providers, in, the, region, great, physical, distance, between, the, home, and, health, service, facilities, high, transportation, costs, high, treatment, costs, and, social, norms, and, stigma, toward, accessing, certain, health, services, with, lifestyle, factors, such, as, diet, and, exercise, rising, to, the, top, of, preventable, death, statistics, the, economics, of, healthy, lifestyle, is, a, growing, concern, there, is, little, question, that, positive, lifestyle, choices, provide, an, investment, in, health, throughout, life, to, gauge, success, traditional, measures, such, as, the, quality, years, of, life, method, qaly, show, great, value, however, that, method, does, not, account, for, the, cost, of, chronic, conditions, or, future, lost, earnings, because, of, poor, health, developing, future, economic, models, that, would, guide, both, private, and, public, investments, as, well, as, drive, future, policy, to, evaluate, the, efficacy, of, positive, lifestyle, choices, on, health, is, a, major, topic, for, economists, globally, americans, spend, over, three, trillion, a, year, on, health, care, but, have, a, higher, rate, of, infant, mortality, shorter, life, expectancies, and, a, higher, rate, of, diabetes, than, other, high, income, nations, because, of, negative, lifestyle, choices, despite, these, large, costs, very, little, is, spent, on, prevention, for, lifestyle, caused, conditions, in, comparison, in, 2016, the, journal, of, the, american, medical, association, estimated, that, 101, billion, was, spent, in, 2013, on, the, preventable, disease, of, diabetes, and, another, 88, billion, was, spent, on, heart, disease, in, an, effort, to, encourage, healthy, lifestyle, choices, as, of, 2010, workplace, wellness, programs, were, on, the, rise, but, the, economics, and, effectiveness, data, were, continuing, to, evolve, and, develop, health, insurance, coverage, impacts, lifestyle, choices, even, intermittent, loss, of, coverage, had, negative, effects, on, healthy, choices, in, the, u, s, the, repeal, of, the, affordable, care, act, aca, could, significantly, impact, coverage, for, many, americans, as, well, as, the, prevention, and, public, health, fund, which, is, the, u, s, first, and, only, mandatory, funding, stream, dedicated, to, improving, public, health, including, counseling, on, lifestyle, prevention, issues, such, as, weight, management, alcohol, use, and, treatment, for, depression, because, in, the, u, s, chronic, illnesses, predominate, as, a, cause, of, death, and, pathways, for, treating, chronic, illnesses, are, complex, and, multifaceted, prevention, is, a, best, practice, approach, to, chronic, disease, when, possible, in, many, cases, prevention, requires, mapping, complex, pathways, to, determine, the, ideal, point, for, intervention, cost, effectiveness, of, prevention, is, achievable, but, impacted, by, the, length, of, time, it, takes, to, see, effects, outcomes, of, intervention, this, makes, prevention, efforts, difficult, to, fund, particularly, in, strained, financial, contexts, prevention, potentially, creates, other, costs, as, well, due, to, extending, the, lifespan, and, thereby, increasing, opportunities, for, illness, in, order, to, assess, the, cost, effectiveness, of, prevention, the, cost, of, the, preventive, measure, savings, from, avoiding, morbidity, and, the, cost, from, extending, the, lifespan, need, to, be, considered, life, extension, costs, become, smaller, when, accounting, for, savings, from, postponing, the, last, year, of, life, which, makes, up, a, large, fraction, of, lifetime, medical, expenditures, and, becomes, cheaper, with, age, prevention, leads, to, savings, only, if, the, cost, of, the, preventive, measure, is, less, than, the, savings, from, avoiding, morbidity, net, of, the, cost, of, extending, the, life, span, in, order, to, establish, reliable, economics, of, prevention, for, illnesses, that, are, complicated, in, origin, knowing, how, best, to, assess, prevention, efforts, i, e, developing, useful, measures, and, appropriate, scope, is, required, there, is, no, general, consensus, as, to, whether, or, not, preventive, healthcare, measures, are, cost, effective, but, they, increase, the, quality, of, life, dramatically, there, are, varying, views, on, what, constitutes, a, good, investment, some, argue, that, preventive, health, measures, should, save, more, money, than, they, cost, when, factoring, in, treatment, costs, in, the, absence, of, such, measures, others, have, argued, in, favor, of, good, value, or, conferring, significant, health, benefits, even, if, the, measures, do, not, save, money, furthermore, preventive, health, services, are, often, described, as, one, entity, though, they, comprise, a, myriad, of, different, services, each, of, which, can, individually, lead, to, net, costs, savings, or, neither, greater, differentiation, of, these, services, is, necessary, to, fully, understand, both, the, financial, and, health, effects, a, 2010, study, reported, that, in, the, united, states, vaccinating, children, cessation, of, smoking, daily, prophylactic, use, of, aspirin, and, screening, of, breast, and, colorectal, cancers, had, the, most, potential, to, prevent, premature, death, preventive, health, measures, that, resulted, in, savings, included, vaccinating, children, and, adults, smoking, cessation, daily, use, of, aspirin, and, screening, for, issues, with, alcoholism, obesity, and, vision, failure, these, authors, estimated, that, if, usage, of, these, services, in, the, united, states, increased, to, 90, of, the, population, there, would, be, net, savings, of, 3, 7, billion, which, comprised, only, about, 0, 2, of, the, total, 2006, united, states, healthcare, expenditure, despite, the, potential, for, decreasing, healthcare, spending, utilization, of, healthcare, resources, in, the, united, states, still, remains, low, especially, among, latinos, and, african, americans, overall, preventive, services, are, difficult, to, implement, because, healthcare, providers, have, limited, time, with, patients, and, must, integrate, a, variety, of, preventive, health, measures, from, different, sources, while, these, specific, services, bring, about, small, net, savings, not, every, preventive, health, measure, saves, more, than, it, costs, a, 1970s, study, showed, that, preventing, heart, attacks, by, treating, hypertension, early, on, with, drugs, actually, did, not, save, money, in, the, long, run, the, money, saved, by, evading, treatment, from, heart, attack, and, stroke, only, amounted, to, about, a, quarter, of, the, cost, of, the, drugs, similarly, it, was, found, that, the, cost, of, drugs, or, dietary, changes, to, decrease, high, blood, cholesterol, exceeded, the, cost, of, subsequent, heart, disease, treatment, due, to, these, findings, some, argue, that, rather, than, focusing, healthcare, reform, efforts, exclusively, on, preventive, care, the, interventions, that, bring, about, the, highest, level, of, health, should, be, prioritized, in, 2008, cohen, et, al, outlined, a, few, arguments, made, by, skeptics, of, preventive, healthcare, many, argue, that, preventive, measures, only, cost, less, than, future, treatment, when, the, proportion, of, the, population, that, would, become, ill, in, the, absence, of, prevention, is, fairly, large, the, diabetes, prevention, program, research, group, conducted, a, 2012, study, evaluating, the, costs, and, benefits, in, quality, adjusted, life, years, or, qalys, of, lifestyle, changes, versus, taking, the, drug, metformin, they, found, that, neither, method, brought, about, financial, savings, but, were, cost, effective, nonetheless, because, they, brought, about, an, increase, in, qalys, in, addition, to, scrutinizing, costs, preventive, healthcare, skeptics, also, examine, efficiency, of, interventions, they, argue, that, while, many, treatments, of, existing, diseases, involve, use, of, advanced, equipment, and, technology, in, some, cases, this, is, a, more, efficient, use, of, resources, than, attempts, to, prevent, the, disease, cohen, suggested, that, the, preventive, measures, most, worth, exploring, and, investing, in, are, those, that, could, benefit, a, large, portion, of, the, population, to, bring, about, cumulative, and, widespread, health, benefits, at, a, reasonable, cost, there, are, at, least, four, nationally, implemented, childhood, obesity, interventions, in, the, united, states, the, sugar, sweetened, beverage, excise, tax, ssb, the, tv, ad, program, active, physical, education, active, pe, policies, and, early, care, and, education, ece, policies, they, each, have, similar, goals, of, reducing, childhood, obesity, the, effects, of, these, interventions, on, bmi, have, been, studied, and, the, cost, effectiveness, analysis, cea, has, led, to, a, better, understanding, of, projected, cost, reductions, and, improved, health, outcomes, the, childhood, obesity, intervention, cost, effectiveness, study, choices, was, conducted, to, evaluate, and, compare, the, cea, of, these, four, interventions, gortmaker, s, l, et, al, 2015, states, the, four, initial, interventions, were, selected, by, the, investigators, to, represent, a, broad, range, of, nationally, scalable, strategies, to, reduce, childhood, obesity, using, a, mix, of, both, policy, and, programmatic, strategies, 1, an, excise, tax, of, 0, 01, per, ounce, of, sweetened, beverages, applied, nationally, and, administered, at, the, state, level, ssb, 2, elimination, of, the, tax, deductibility, of, advertising, costs, of, tv, advertisements, for, nutritionally, poor, foods, and, beverages, seen, by, children, and, adolescents, tv, ad, 3, state, policy, requiring, all, public, elementary, schools, in, which, physical, education, pe, is, currently, provided, to, devote, 50, of, pe, class, time, to, moderate, and, vigorous, physical, activity, active, pe, and, 4, state, policy, to, make, early, child, educational, settings, healthier, by, increasing, physical, activity, improving, nutrition, and, reducing, screen, time, ece, the, choices, found, that, ssb, tv, ad, and, ece, led, to, net, cost, savings, both, ssb, and, tv, ad, increased, quality, adjusted, life, years, and, produced, yearly, tax, revenue, of, 12, 5, billion, u, s, dollars, and, 80, million, u, s, dollars, respectively, some, challenges, with, evaluating, the, effectiveness, of, child, obesity, interventions, include, as, of, 2009, the, cost, effectiveness, of, preventive, care, is, a, highly, debated, topic, while, some, economists, argue, that, preventive, care, is, valuable, and, potentially, cost, saving, others, believe, it, is, an, inefficient, waste, of, resources, preventive, care, is, composed, of, a, variety, of, clinical, services, and, programs, including, annual, doctor, s, check, ups, annual, immunizations, and, wellness, programs, recent, models, show, that, these, simple, interventions, can, have, significant, economic, impacts, research, on, preventive, care, addresses, the, question, of, whether, it, is, cost, saving, or, cost, effective, and, whether, there, is, an, economics, evidence, base, for, health, promotion, and, disease, prevention, the, need, for, and, interest, in, preventive, care, is, driven, by, the, imperative, to, reduce, health, care, costs, while, improving, quality, of, care, and, the, patient, experience, preventive, care, can, lead, to, improved, health, outcomes, and, cost, savings, potential, services, such, as, health, assessments, screenings, prenatal, care, and, telehealth, and, telemedicine, can, reduce, morbidity, or, mortality, with, low, cost, or, cost, savings, specifically, health, assessments, screenings, have, cost, savings, potential, with, varied, cost, effectiveness, based, on, screening, and, assessment, type, inadequate, prenatal, care, can, lead, to, an, increased, risk, of, prematurity, stillbirth, and, infant, death, time, is, the, ultimate, resource, and, preventive, care, can, help, mitigate, the, time, costs, telehealth, and, telemedicine, is, one, option, that, has, gained, consumer, interest, acceptance, and, confidence, and, can, improve, quality, of, care, and, patient, satisfaction, there, are, benefits, and, trade, offs, when, considering, investment, in, preventive, care, versus, other, types, of, clinical, services, preventive, care, can, be, a, good, investment, as, supported, by, the, evidence, base, and, can, drive, population, health, management, objectives, the, concepts, of, cost, saving, and, cost, effectiveness, are, different, and, both, are, relevant, to, preventive, care, preventive, care, that, may, not, save, money, may, still, provide, health, benefits, thus, there, is, a, need, to, compare, interventions, relative, to, impact, on, health, and, cost, preventive, care, transcends, demographics, and, is, applicable, to, people, of, every, age, the, health, capital, theory, underpins, the, importance, of, preventive, care, across, the, lifecycle, and, provides, a, framework, for, understanding, the, variances, in, health, and, health, care, that, are, experienced, it, treats, health, as, a, stock, that, provides, direct, utility, health, depreciates, with, age, and, the, aging, process, can, be, countered, through, health, investments, the, theory, further, supports, that, individuals, demand, good, health, that, the, demand, for, health, investment, is, a, derived, demand, i, e, investment, is, health, is, due, to, the, underlying, demand, for, good, health, and, the, efficiency, of, the, health, investment, process, increases, with, knowledge, i, e, it, is, assumed, that, the, more, educated, are, more, efficient, consumers, and, producers, of, health, the, prevalence, elasticity, of, demand, for, prevention, can, also, provide, insights, into, the, economics, demand, for, preventive, care, can, alter, the, prevalence, rate, of, a, given, disease, and, further, reduce, or, even, reverse, any, further, growth, of, prevalence, reduction, in, prevalence, subsequently, leads, to, reduction, in, costs, there, are, a, number, of, organizations, and, policy, actions, that, are, relevant, when, discussing, the, economics, of, preventive, care, services, the, evidence, base, viewpoints, and, policy, briefs, from, the, robert, wood, johnson, foundation, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, oecd, and,

was, projected, that, by, 2023, that, the, number, of, chronic, disease, cases, would, increase, by, 42, resulting, in, 4, 2, trillion, in, treatment, and, lost, economic, output, they, are, also, among, the, top, ten, leading, causes, of, mortality, chronic, diseases, are, driven, by, risk, factors, that, are, largely, preventable, sub, analysis, performed, on, all, deaths, in, the, united, states, in, 2000, revealed, that, almost, half, were, attributed, to, preventable, behaviors, including, tobacco, poor, diet, physical, inactivity, and, alcohol, consumption, more, recent, analysis, reveals, that, heart, disease, and, cancer, alone, accounted, for, nearly, 46, of, all, deaths, modifiable, risk, factors, are, also, responsible, for, a, large, morbidity, burden, resulting, in, poor, quality, of, life, in, the, present, and, loss, of, future, life, earning, years, it, is, further, estimated, that, by, 2023, focused, efforts, on, the, prevention, and, treatment, of, chronic,

the, number, of, healthy, days, available, to, work, and, to, earn, income, in, this, context, health, can, be, treated, both, as, a, consumption, good, wherein, individuals, desire, health, because, it, improves, quality, of, life, in, the, present, and, as, an, investment, good, because, of, its, potential, to, increase, attendance, and, workplace, productivity, over, time, preventive, health, behaviors, such, as, healthful, diet, regular, exercise, access, to, and, use, of, well, care, avoiding, tobacco, and, limiting, alcohol, can, be, viewed, as, health, inputs, that, result, in, both,
