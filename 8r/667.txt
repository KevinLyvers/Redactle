see, text, larks, are, passerine, birds, of, the, family, alaudidae, larks, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, with, the, largest, number, of, species, occurring, in, africa, only, a, single, species, the, horned, lark, occurs, in, north, america, and, only, horsfield, s, bush, lark, occurs, in, australia, habitats, vary, widely, but, many, species, live, in, dry, regions, when, the, word, lark, is, used, without, specification, it, often, refers, to, the, eurasian, skylark, alauda, arvensis, the, family, alaudidae, was, introduced, in, 1825, by, the, irish, zoologist, nicholas, aylward, vigors, as, a, subfamily, alaudina, of, the, finch, family, fringillidae, larks, are, a, well, defined, family, partly, because, of, the, shape, of, their, tarsus, they, have, multiple, scutes, on, the, hind, side, of, their, tarsi, rather, than, the, single, plate, found, in, most, songbirds, they, also, lack, a, pessulus, the, bony, central, structure, in, the, syrinx, of, songbirds, they, were, long, placed, at, or, near, the, beginning, of, the, songbirds, or, oscines, now, often, called, passeri, just, after, the, suboscines, and, before, the, swallows, for, example, in, the, american, ornithologists, union, s, first, check, list, some, authorities, such, as, the, british, ornithologists, union, and, the, handbook, of, the, birds, of, the, world, adhere, to, that, placement, however, many, other, classifications, follow, the, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, in, placing, the, larks, in, a, large, oscine, subgroup, passerida, which, excludes, crows, shrikes, and, their, allies, vireos, and, many, groups, characteristic, of, australia, and, southeastern, asia, for, instance, the, american, ornithologists, union, places, larks, just, after, the, crows, shrikes, and, vireos, at, a, finer, level, of, detail, some, now, place, the, larks, at, the, beginning, of, a, superfamily, sylvioidea, with, the, swallows, various, old, world, warbler, and, babbler, groups, and, others, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, have, shown, that, within, the, sylvioidea, the, larks, form, a, sister, clade, to, the, family, panuridae, which, contains, a, single, species, the, bearded, reedling, panurus, biarmicus, the, phylogeny, of, larks, alaudidae, was, reviewed, in, 2013, leading, to, the, recognition, of, the, arrangement, below, the, genus, level, cladogram, shown, below, is, based, on, a, molecular, phylogenetic, study, of, the, larks, by, per, alstr, m, and, collaborators, published, in, 2023, the, subfamilies, are, those, proposed, by, the, authors, for, two, species, the, results, conflict, with, the, taxonomy, published, online, in, july, 2023, by, frank, gill, pamela, rasmussen, and, david, donsker, on, behalf, of, the, international, ornithological, committee, ioc, the, rusty, bush, lark, mirafra, rufa, and, gillett, s, lark, mirafra, gilletti, were, found, to, be, embedded, in, the, genus, calendulauda, alstr, m, and, collaborators, proposed, that, the, genus, mirafra, should, be, split, into, four, genera, mirafra, plocealauda, amirafra, and, corypha, alaemon, hoopoe, larks, 2, species, ammomanopsis, gray, s, lark, chersomanes, larks, 2,

75, g, 0, 5, to, 2, 6, oz, in, mass, the, smallest, larks, are, likely, the, spizocorys, species, which, can, weigh, only, around, 14, g, 0, 49, oz, in, species, like, the, pink, billed, lark, and, the, obbia, lark, while, the, largest, lark, is, the, tibetan, lark, like, many, ground, birds, most, lark, species, have, long, hind, claws, which, are, thought, to, provide, stability, while, standing, most, have, streaked, brown, plumage, some, boldly, marked, with, black, or, white, their, dull, appearance, camouflages, them, on, the, ground, especially, when, on, the, nest, they, feed, on, insects, and, seeds, though, adults, of, most, species, eat, seeds, primarily, all, species, feed, their, young, insects, for, at, least, the, first, week, after, hatching, many, species, dig, with, their, bills, to, uncover, food, some, larks, have, heavy, bills, reaching, an, extreme, in, the, thick, billed, lark, for, cracking, seeds, open, while, others, have, long, down, curved, bills, which, are, especially, suitable, for, digging, larks, are, the, only, passerines, that, lose, all, their, feathers, in, their, first, moult, in, all, species, whose, first, moult, is, known, this, may, result, from, the, poor, quality, of, the, chicks, feathers, which, in, turn, may, result, from, the, benefits, to, the, parents, of, switching, the, young, to, a, lower, quality, diet, seeds, which, requires, less, work, from, the, parents, in, many, respects, including, long, tertial, feathers, larks, resemble, other, ground, birds, such, as, pipits, however, in, larks, the, tarsus, the, lowest, leg, bone, connected, to, the, toes, has, only, one, set, of, scales, on, the, rear, surface, which, is, rounded, pipits, and, all, other, songbirds, have, two, plates, of, scales, on, the, rear, surface, which, meet, at, a, protruding, rear, edge, larks, have, more, elaborate, calls, than, most, birds, and, often, extravagant, songs, given, in, display, flight, these, melodious, sounds, to, human, ears, combined, with, a, willingness, to, expand, into, anthropogenic, habitats, as, long, as, these, are, not, too, intensively, managed, have, ensured, larks, a, prominent, place, in, literature, and, music, especially, the, eurasian, skylark, in, northern, europe, and, the, crested, lark, and, calandra, lark, in, southern, europe, male, larks, use, song, flights, to, defend, their, breeding, territory, and, attract, a, mate, most, species, build, nests, on, the, ground, usually, cups, of, dead, grass, but, in, some, species, the, nests, are, more, complicated, and, partly, domed, a, few, desert, species, nest, very, low, in, bushes, perhaps, so, circulating, air, can, cool, the, nest, larks, eggs, are, usually, speckled, the, size, of, the, clutch, is, very, variable, and, ranges, from, the, single, egg, laid, by, sclater, s, lark, up, to, 6, 8, eggs, laid, by, the, calandra, lark, and, the, black, lark, larks, incubate, for, 11, to, 16, days, larks, commonly, consumed, with, bones, intact, have, historically, been, considered, wholesome, delicate, and, light, game, they, can, be, used, in, a, number, of, dishes, for, example, they, can, be, stewed, broiled, or, used, as, filling, in, a, meat, pie, lark, s, tongues, are, reputed, to, have, been, particularly, highly, valued, as, a, delicacy, in, modern, times, shrinking, habitats, made, lark, meat, rare, and, hard, to, come, by, though, it, can, still, be, found, in, restaurants, in, italy, and, elsewhere, in, southern, europe, the, lark, in, mythology, and, literature, stands, for, daybreak, as, in, chaucer, s, the, knight, s, tale, the, bisy, larke, messager, of, day, and, shakespeare, s, sonnet, 29, the, lark, at, break, of, day, arising, from, sullen, earth, sings, hymns, at, heaven, s, gate, 11, 12, the, lark, is, also, often, simultaneously, associated, with, lovers, and, lovers, observance, as, in, bernart, de, ventadorn, s, can, vei, la, lauzeta, mover, and, with, church, services, these, meanings, of, daybreak, and, religious, reference, can, be, combined, as, in, blake, s, visions, of, the, daughters, of, albion, into, a, spiritual, daybreak, to, signify, passage, from, earth, to, heaven, and, from, heaven, to, earth, with, renaissance, painters, such, as, domenico, ghirlandaio, the, lark, symbolizes, christ, with, reference, to, john, 16, 16, percy,

beijingers, to, teach, their, larks, 13, kinds, of, sounds, in, a, strict, order, called, the, 13, songs, of, a, lark, chinese, the, larks, that, can, sing, the, full, 13, sounds, in, the, correct, order, are, highly, valued, while, any, disruption, in, the, songs, will, decrease, their, value, significantly, larks, sing, early, in, the, day, often, before, dawn, leading, to, the, expression,
