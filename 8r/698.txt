captured, at, midway, atoll, diomedea, thalassarche, phoebastria, phoebetria, tydea, plotornis, diomedavus, aldiomedes, albatrosses, of, the, biological, family, diomedeidae, are, large, seabirds, related, to, the, procellariids, storm, petrels, and, diving, petrels, in, the, order, procellariiformes, the, tubenoses, they, range, widely, in, the, southern, ocean, and, the, north, pacific, they, are, absent, from, the, north, atlantic, although, fossil, remains, of, short, tailed, albatross, show, they, once, lived, there, up, to, the, pleistocene, and, occasional, vagrants, are, found, great, albatrosses, are, among, the, largest, of, flying, birds, with, wingspans, reaching, up, to, 2, 5, 3, 5, metres, 8, 2, 11, 5, ft, and, bodies, over, 1, metre, 3, 3, ft, in, length, the, albatrosses, are, usually, regarded, as, falling, into, four, genera, but, disagreement, exists, over, the, number, of, species, albatrosses, are, highly, efficient, in, the, air, using, dynamic, soaring, and, slope, soaring, to, cover, great, distances, with, little, exertion, they, feed, on, squid, fish, and, krill, by, either, scavenging, surface, seizing, or, diving, albatrosses, are, colonial, nesting, for, the, most, part, on, remote, oceanic, islands, often, with, several, species, nesting, together, pair, bonds, between, males, and, females, form, over, several, years, with, the, use, of, ritualised, dances, and, last, for, the, life, of, the, pair, a, breeding, season, can, take, over, a, year, from, laying, to, fledging, with, a, single, egg, laid, in, each, breeding, attempt, a, laysan, albatross, named, wisdom, on, midway, island, is, the, oldest, known, wild, bird, in, the, world, she, was, first, banded, in, 1956, by, chandler, robbins, of, the, 22, species, of, albatrosses, recognised, by, the, iucn, 21, are, listed, as, at, some, level, of, concern, two, species, are, critically, endangered, seven, species, are, endangered, six, species, are, vulnerable, and, six, species, are, near, threatened, numbers, of, albatrosses, have, declined, in, the, past, due, to, harvesting, for, feathers, albatrosses, are, threatened, by, introduced, species, such, as, rats, and, feral, cats, that, attack, eggs, chicks, and, nesting, adults, by, pollution, by, a, serious, decline, in, fish, stocks, in, many, regions, largely, due, to, overfishing, and, by, longline, fishing, longline, fisheries, pose, the, greatest, threat, as, feeding, birds, are, attracted, to, the, bait, become, hooked, on, the, lines, and, drown, identified, stakeholders, such, as, governments, conservation, organisations, and, people, in, the, fishing, industry, are, all, working, toward, reducing, this, phenomenon, the, name, albatross, is, derived, from, the, arabic, al, q, d, s, or, al, a, s, a, pelican, literally, the, diver, which, travelled, to, english, via, the, portuguese, form, alcatraz, gannet, which, is, also, the, origin, of, the, name, of, the, former, prison, alcatraz, the, oxford, english, dictionary, notes, that, the, word, alcatraz, was, originally, applied, to, the, frigatebird, the, modification, to, albatross, was, perhaps, influenced, by, latin, albus, meaning, white, in, contrast, to, frigatebirds, which, are, black, they, were, once, commonly, known, as, goonie, birds, or, gooney, birds, particularly, those, of, the, north, pacific, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, name, mollymawk, is, still, well, established, in, some, areas, which, is, a, corrupted, form, of, malle, mugge, an, old, dutch, name, for, the, northern, fulmar, the, name, diomedea, assigned, to, the, albatrosses, by, linnaeus, references, the, mythical, metamorphosis, of, the, companions, of, the, greek, warrior, diomedes, into, birds, finally, the, name, for, the, order, procellariiformes, comes, from, the, latin, word, procella, meaning, a, violent, wind, or, a, storm, the, albatross, designation, comprises, between, 13, and, 24, species, the, number, is, still, a, matter, of, some, debate, with, 21, being, the, most, commonly, accepted, number, in, four, genera, these, genera, are, the, great, albatrosses, diomedea, the, mollymawks, thalassarche, the, north, pacific, albatrosses, phoebastria, and, the, sooty, albatrosses, or, sooties, phoebetria, the, north, pacific, albatrosses, are, considered, to, be, a, sister, taxon, to, the, great, albatrosses, while, the, sooty, albatrosses, are, considered, closer, to, the, mollymawks, the, taxonomy, of, the, albatross, group, has, been, a, source, of, much, debate, the, sibley, ahlquist, taxonomy, places, seabirds, birds, of, prey, and, many, others, in, a, greatly, enlarged, order, the, ciconiiformes, whereas, the, ornithological, organisations, in, north, america, europe, south, africa, australia, and, new, zealand, retain, the, more, traditional, order, procellariiformes, the, albatrosses, can, be, separated, from, the, other, procellariiformes, both, genetically, and, through, morphological, characteristics, size, their, legs, and, the, arrangement, of, their, nasal, tubes, see, below, morphology, and, flight, within, the, family, the, assignment, of, genera, has, been, debated, for, over, 100, years, originally, placed, into, a, single, genus, diomedea, they, were, rearranged, by, reichenbach, into, four, different, genera, in, 1852, then, lumped, back, together, and, split, apart, again, several, times, acquiring, 12, different, genus, names, in, total, though, never, more, than, eight, at, one, time, by, 1965, diomedea, phoebastria, thalassarche, phoebetria, thalassageron, diomedella, nealbatrus, rhothonia, julietata, galapagornis, laysanornis, and, penthirenia, by, 1965, in, an, attempt, to, bring, some, order, back, to, the, classification, of, albatrosses, they, were, lumped, into, two, genera, phoebetria, the, sooty, albatrosses, which, most, closely, seemed, to, resemble, the, procellarids, and, were, at, the, time, considered, primitive, and, diomedea, the, rest, though, a, case, was, made, for, the, simplification, of, the, family, particularly, the, nomenclature, the, classification, was, based, on, the, morphological, analysis, by, elliott, coues, in, 1866, and, paid, little, attention, to, more, recent, studies, and, even, ignored, some, of, coues, s, suggestions, research, by, gary, nunn, of, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, 1996, and, other, researchers, around, the, world, studied, the, mitochondrial, dna, of, all, 14, accepted, species, finding, four, not, two, monophyletic, groups, within, the, albatrosses, they, proposed, the, resurrection, of, two, of, the, old, genus, names, phoebastria, for, the, north, pacific, albatrosses, and, thalassarche, for, the, mollymawks, with, the, great, albatrosses, retaining, diomedea, and, the, sooty, albatrosses, staying, in, phoebetria, while, some, agree, on, the, number, of, genera, fewer, agree, on, the, number, of, species, historically, up, to, 80, different, taxa, have, been, described, by, different, researchers, most, of, these, were, incorrectly, identified, juvenile, birds, based, on, the, work, on, albatross, genera, robertson, and, nunn, went, on, in, 1998, to, propose, a, revised, taxonomy, with, 24, different, species, compared, to, the, 14, then, accepted, this, expanded, taxonomy, elevated, many, established, subspecies, to, full, species, but, was, criticised, for, not, using, in, every, case, peer, reviewed, information, to, justify, the, splits, since, then, further, studies, have, in, some, instances, supported, or, disproved, the, splits, a, 2004, paper, analysing, the, mitochondrial, dna, and, microsatellites, agreed, with, the, conclusion, that, the, antipodean, albatross, and, the, tristan, albatross, were, distinct, from, the, wandering, albatross, per, robertson, and, nunn, but, found, that, the, suggested, gibson, s, albatross, diomedea, gibsoni, was, not, distinct, from, the, antipodean, albatross, for, the, most, part, an, interim, taxonomy, of, 21, species, is, accepted, by, itis, and, many, other, researchers, though, by, no, means, all, in, 2004, penhallurick, and, wink, called, for, the, number, of, species, to, be, reduced, to, 13, including, the, lumping, of, the, amsterdam, albatross, with, the, wandering, albatross, although, this, paper, was, itself, controversial, sibley, and, ahlquist, s, molecular, study, of, the, evolution, of, the, bird, families, has, put, the, radiation, of, the, procellariiformes, in, the, oligocene, period, 35, 30, million, years, ago, mya, though, this, group, probably, originated, earlier, with, a, fossil, sometimes, attributed, to, the, order, a, seabird, known, as, tytthostonyx, being, found, in, late, cretaceous, rocks, 70, mya, the, molecular, evidence, suggests, that, the, storm, petrels, were, the, first, to, diverge, from, the, ancestral, stock, and, the, albatrosses, next, with, the, procellarids, and, diving, petrels, separating, later, the, earliest, fossil, albatrosses, were, found, in, eocene, to, oligocene, rocks, although, some, of, these, are, only, tentatively, assigned, to, the, family, and, none, appear, to, be, particularly, close, to, the, living, forms, they, are, murunkus, middle, eocene, of, uzbekistan, manu, early, oligocene, of, new, zealand, and, an, undescribed, form, from, the, late, oligocene, of, south, carolina, the, oldest, widely, accepted, fossil, albatross, is, tydea, septentrionalis, from, the, early, oligocene, of, belgium, diomedavus, knapptonensis, is, smaller, than, all, extant, albatrosses, and, was, found, in, late, oligocene, strata, of, washington, state, usa, plotornis, was, formerly, often, considered, a, petrel, but, is, now, accepted, as, an, albatross, it, is, from, the, middle, miocene, of, france, a, time, when, the, split, between, the, four, modern, genera, was, already, underway, as, evidenced, by, phoebastria, californica, and, diomedea, milleri, both, being, mid, miocene, species, from, sharktooth, hill, california, these, show, that, the, split, between, the, great, albatrosses, and, the, north, pacific, albatrosses, occurred, by, 15, mya, similar, fossil, finds, in, the, southern, hemisphere, put, the, split, between, the, sooties, and, mollymawks, at, 10, mya, the, fossil, record, of, the, albatrosses, in, the, northern, hemisphere, is, more, complete, than, that, of, the, southern, and, many, fossil, forms, of, albatross, have, been, found, in, the, north, atlantic, which, today, has, no, albatrosses, the, remains, of, a, colony, of, short, tailed, albatrosses, have, been, uncovered, on, the, island, of, bermuda, and, the, majority, of, fossil, albatrosses, from, the, north, atlantic, have, been, of, the, genus, phoebastria, the, north, pacific, albatrosses, one, phoebastria, anglica, has, been, found, in, deposits, in, both, north, carolina, and, england, due, to, convergent, evolution, in, particular, of, the, leg, and, foot, bones, remains, of, the, prehistoric, pseudotooth, birds, pelagornithidae, may, be, mistaken, for, those, of, extinct, albatrosses, manu, may, be, such, a, case, and, quite, certainly, the, supposed, giant, albatross, femur, from, the, early, pleistocene, dainichi, formation, at, kakegawa, japan, actually, is, from, one, of, the, last, pseudotooth, birds, aldiomedes, angustirostris, was, a, uniquely, narrow, beaked, species, from, the, pliocene, of, new, zealand, the, albatrosses, are, a, group, of, large, to, very, large, birds, they, are, the, largest, of, the, procellariiformes, the, bill, is, large, strong, and, sharp, edged, with, the, upper, mandible, terminating, in, a, large, hook, this, bill, is, composed, of, several, horny, plates, and, along, the, sides, are, the, two, tubes, long, nostrils, that, give, the, order, its, former, name, tubinares, or, tubenoses, the, tubes, of, all, albatrosses, are, along, the, sides, of, the, bill, unlike, the, rest, of, the, procellariiformes, where, the, tubes, run, along, the, top, of, the, bill, these, tubes, allow, the, albatrosses, to, measure, the, exact, airspeed, in, flight, the, nostrils, are, analogous, to, the, pitot, tubes, in, modern, aircraft, the, albatross, needs, accurate, airspeed, measurement, to, perform, dynamic, soaring, like, other, procellariiformes, they, use, their, uniquely, developed, sense, of, smell, to, locate, potential, food, sources, whereas, most, birds, depend, on, eyesight, the, feet, have, no, hind, toe, and, the, three, anterior, toes, are, completely, webbed, the, legs, are, strong, for, the, procellariiformes, making, them, and, the, giant, petrels, the, only, members, of, that, order, that, can, walk, well, on, land, albatrosses, along, with, all, procellariiformes, must, excrete, the, salts, they, ingest, in, drinking, sea, water, and, eating, marine, invertebrates, all, birds, have, an, enlarged, nasal, gland, at, the, base, of, the, bill, above, their, eyes, this, gland, is, inactive, in, species, that, do, not, require, it, but, in, the, procellariiformes, it, acts, as, a, salt, gland, scientists, are, uncertain, as, to, its, exact, processes, but, do, know, in, general, terms, that, it, removes, salt, by, secreting, a, 5, saline, solution, that, drips, out, of, their, noses, or, is, forcibly, ejected, the, adult, plumage, of, most, of, the, albatrosses, is, usually, some, variation, of, dark, upper, wing, and, back, with, white, undersides, often, compared, to, that, of, a, gull, the, extent, of, colouration, varies, the, southern, royal, albatross, is, almost, completely, white, except, for, the, ends, and, trailing, edges, of, the, wings, in, fully, mature, males, while, the, amsterdam, albatross, has, an, almost, juvenile, like, breeding, plumage, with, a, great, deal, of, brown, particularly, a, strong, brown, band, around, the, chest, several, species, of, mollymawks, and, north, pacific, albatrosses, have, face, markings, like, eye, patches, or, have, grey, or, yellow, on, the, head, and, nape, three, albatross, species, the, black, footed, albatross, and, the, two, sooty, albatrosses, vary, completely, from, the, usual, patterns, and, are, almost, entirely, dark, brown, or, dark, grey, in, places, in, the, case, of, the, light, mantled, albatross, albatrosses, take, several, years, to, get, their, full, adult, breeding, plumage, the, wingspans, of, the, largest, great, albatrosses, genus, diomedea, are, the, largest, of, any, bird, exceeding, 3, 40, m, 11, 2, ft, although, the, other, species, wingspans, are, considerably, smaller, at, as, low, as, 1, 75, m, 5, 7, ft, the, wings, are, stiff, and, cambered, with, thickened, streamlined, leading, edges, albatrosses, travel, long, distances, with, two, techniques, used, by, many, long, winged, seabirds, dynamic, soaring, and, slope, soaring, dynamic, soaring, involves, repeatedly, rising, into, wind, and, descending, downwind, thus, gaining, energy, from, the, vertical, wind, gradient, the, only, effort, expended, is, in, the, turns, at, the, top, and, bottom, of, every, such, loop, this, maneuver, allows, the, bird, to, cover, almost, 1, 000, km, d, 620, mi, d, without, flapping, its, wings, slope, soaring, uses, the, rising, air, on, the, windward, side, of, large, waves, albatross, have, high, glide, ratios, around, 22, 1, to, 23, 1, meaning, that, for, every, metre, they, drop, they, can, travel, forward, twenty, two, metres, they, are, aided, in, soaring, by, a, shoulder, lock, a, sheet, of, tendon, that, locks, the, wing, when, fully, extended, allowing, the, wing, to, be, kept, outstretched, without, any, muscle, expenditure, a, morphological, adaptation, they, share, with, the, giant, petrels, albatrosses, combine, these, soaring, techniques, with, the, use, of, predictable, weather, systems, albatrosses, in, the, southern, hemisphere, flying, north, from, their, colonies, take, a, clockwise, route, and, those, flying, south, fly, counterclockwise, albatrosses, are, so, well, adapted, to, this, lifestyle, that, their, heart, rates, while, flying, are, close, to, their, basal, heart, rate, when, resting, this, efficiency, is, such, that, the, most, energetically, demanding, aspect, of, a, foraging, trip, is, not, the, distance, covered, but, the, landings, take, offs, and, hunting, they, undertake, having, found, a, food, source, a, common, assumption, is, that, albatrosses, must, be, able, to, sleep, in, flight, although, no, direct, evidence, has, ever, been, obtained, this, efficient, long, distance, travelling, underlies, the, albatross, s, success, as, a, long, distance, forager, covering, great, distances, and, expending, little, energy, looking, for, patchily, distributed, food, sources, their, adaptation, to, gliding, flight, makes, them, dependent, on, wind, and, waves, but, their, long, wings, are, ill, suited, to, powered, flight, and, most, species, lack, the, muscles, and, energy, to, undertake, sustained, flapping, flight, albatrosses, in, calm, seas, rest, on, the, ocean, s, surface, until, the, wind, picks, up, again, as, using, powered, flight, is, not, energetically, worthwhile, though, they, are, capable, of, flight, to, avoid, danger, the, north, pacific, albatrosses, can, use, a, flight, style, known, as, flap, gliding, where, the, bird, progresses, by, bursts, of, flapping, followed, by, gliding, when, taking, off, albatrosses, need, to, take, a, run, up, to, allow, enough, air, to, move, under, the, wing, to, provide, lift, the, dynamic, soaring, of, albatrosses, has, provided, inspiration, to, airplane, designers, german, aerospace, engineer, johannes, traugott, and, colleagues, have, charted, the, albatross, s, nuanced, flight, pattern, and, are, looking, for, ways, to, apply, this, to, aircraft, especially, in, the, area, of, drones, and, unmanned, aircraft, most, albatrosses, range, in, the, southern, hemisphere, from, antarctica, to, australia, south, africa, and, south, america, the, exceptions, to, this, are, the, four, north, pacific, albatrosses, of, which, three, occur, exclusively, in, the, north, pacific, from, hawaii, to, japan, california, and, alaska, and, one, the, waved, albatross, breeds, in, the, gal, pagos, islands, and, feeds, off, the, coast, of, south, america, the, need, for, wind, to, enable, gliding, is, the, reason, albatrosses, are, for, the, most, part, confined, to, higher, latitudes, being, unsuited, to, sustained, flapping, flight, makes, crossing, the, doldrums, extremely, difficult, the, exception, the, waved, albatross, is, able, to, live, in, the, equatorial, waters, around, the, gal, pagos, islands, because, of, the, cool, waters, of, the, humboldt, current, and, the, resulting, winds, why, the, albatrosses, became, extinct, in, the, north, atlantic, is, unknown, for, certain, although, rising, sea, levels, due, to, an, interglacial, warming, period, are, thought, to, have, submerged, the, site, of, a, short, tailed, albatross, colony, that, has, been, excavated, in, bermuda, some, southern, species, have, occasionally, turned, up, as, vagrants, in, the, north, atlantic, and, can, become, exiled, remaining, there, for, decades, one, of, these, exiles, a, black, browed, albatross, named, albert, has, been, observed, travelling, to, gannet, colonies, in, scotland, for, at, least, 50, years, in, an, attempt, to, breed, another, black, browed, albatross, nicknamed, albie, has, been, frequently, observed, across, northern, europe, since, 2014, and, is, also, believed, to, be, searching, for, a, mate, having, been, recorded, from, germany, scandinavia, and, rspb, bempton, cliffs, in, yorkshire, england, the, use, of, satellite, tracking, is, teaching, scientists, a, great, deal, about, the, way, albatrosses, range, across, the, ocean, to, find, food, they, undertake, no, annual, migration, but, disperse, widely, after, breeding, southern, hemisphere, species, often, undertake, circumpolar, trips, evidence, also, exists, of, separate, ranges, for, different, species, at, sea, a, comparison, of, the, foraging, niches, of, two, related, species, that, breed, on, campbell, island, the, campbell, albatross, and, the, grey, headed, albatross, showed, the, campbell, albatross, primarily, fed, over, the, campbell, plateau, whereas, the, grey, headed, albatross, fed, in, more, pelagic, oceanic, waters, wandering, albatrosses, also, react, strongly, to, bathymetry, feeding, only, in, waters, deeper, than, 1, 000, metres, 3, 000, ft, so, rigidly, did, the, satellite, plots, match, this, contour, that, one, scientist, remarked, it, almost, appears, as, if, the, birds, notice, and, obey, a, no, entry, sign, where, the, water, shallows, to, less, than, 1000, metres, also, evidence, shows, different, ranges, for, the, two, sexes, of, the, same, species, a, study, of, tristan, albatrosses, breeding, on, gough, island, showed, that, males, foraged, to, the, west, of, gough, and, females, to, the, east, the, albatross, diet, is, predominantly, cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and, offal, organ, meat, although, they, also, scavenge, carrion, and, feed, on, other, zooplankton, for, most, species, a, comprehensive, understanding, of, diet, is, known, for, only, the, breeding, season, when, the, albatrosses, regularly, return, to, land, and, study, is, possible, the, importance, of, each, of, these, food, sources, varies, from, species, to, species, and, even, from, population, to, population, some, concentrate, on, squid, alone, others, take, more, krill, or, fish, of, the, two, albatross, species, found, in, hawaii, one, the, black, footed, albatross, takes, mostly, fish, while, the, laysan, feeds, on, squid, the, use, of, data, loggers, at, sea, that, record, ingestion, of, water, against, time, providing, a, likely, time, of, feeding, suggests, that, albatrosses, predominantly, feed, during, the, day, analysis, of, the, squid, beaks, regurgitated, by, albatrosses, has, shown, that, many, of, the, squid, eaten, are, too, large, to, have, been, caught, alive, and, include, midwater, species, likely, to, be, beyond, the, reach, of, albatross, suggesting, that, for, some, species, like, the, wandering, albatross, scavenged, squid, may, be, an, important, part, of, the, diet, the, source, of, these, dead, squid, is, a, matter, of, debate, some, certainly, comes, from, squid, fisheries, but, in, nature, it, primarily, comes, from, the, die, off, that, occurs, after, squid, spawning, and, the, vomit, of, squid, eating, whales, sperm, whales, pilot, whales, and, southern, bottlenose, whales, the, diet, of, other, species, like, the, black, browed, albatross, or, the, grey, headed, albatross, is, rich, with, smaller, species, of, squid, that, tend, to, sink, after, death, and, scavenging, is, not, assumed, to, play, a, large, role, in, their, diet, the, waved, albatross, has, been, observed, practising, kleptoparasitism, harassing, boobies, to, steal, their, food, making, it, the, only, member, of, its, order, to, do, so, regularly, until, recently, albatrosses, were, thought, to, be, predominantly, surface, feeders, swimming, at, the, surface, and, snapping, up, squid, and, fish, pushed, to, the, surface, by, currents, predators, or, death, the, deployment, of, capillary, depth, recorders, which, record, the, maximum, dive, depth, undertaken, by, a, bird, has, shown, that, while, some, species, such, as, the, wandering, albatross, do, not, dive, deeper, than, a, metre, some, species, such, as, the, light, mantled, albatross, have, a, mean, diving, depth, of, almost, 5, m, 16, ft, and, can, dive, as, deep, as, 12, 5, m, 41, ft, in, addition, to, surface, feeding, and, diving, they, have, also, been, observed, plunge, diving, from, the, air, to, snatch, prey, albatrosses, are, colonial, usually, nesting, on, isolated, islands, where, colonies, are, on, larger, landmasses, they, are, found, on, exposed, headlands, with, good, approaches, from, the, sea, in, several, directions, like, the, colony, on, the, otago, peninsula, in, dunedin, new, zealand, many, buller, s, albatrosses, and, black, footed, albatrosses, nest, under, trees, in, open, forest, colonies, vary, from, the, very, dense, aggregations, favoured, by, the, mollymawks, black, browed, albatross, colonies, on, the, falkland, islands, have, densities, of, 70, nests, per, 100, m, 2, to, the, much, looser, groups, and, widely, spaced, individual, nests, favoured, by, the, sooty, and, great, albatrosses, all, albatross, colonies, are, on, islands, that, historically, were, free, of, land, mammals, albatrosses, are, highly, philopatric, meaning, they, usually, return, to, their, natal, colony, to, breed, this, tendency, is, so, strong, that, a, study, of, laysan, albatrosses, showed, that, the, average, distance, between, hatching, site, and, the, site, where, a, bird, established, its, own, territory, was, 22, m, 72, ft, albatrosses, live, much, longer, than, other, birds, they, delay, breeding, for, longer,

the, punishment, given, to, the, mariner, who, killed, the, albatross, a, widespread, myth, holds, that, sailors, believe, shooting, or, harming, an, albatross, is, disastrous, due, in, part, to, the, poem, in, truth, sailors, regularly, killed, and, ate, them, as, reported, by, james, cook, in, 1772, however, other, sailors, reportedly, caught, the, birds, but, let, them, free, again, possibly, believing, that, albatrosses, were, the, souls, of, lost, sailors, so, killing, them, would, bring, bad, luck, the, head, of, an, albatross, being, caught, with, a, hook, is, used, as, the, emblem,

albatross, endangered, 7, species, or, vulnerable, 6, species, six, further, species, are, considered, as, near, threatened, and, only, one, of, least, concern, one, of, the, main, threats, is, commercial, longline, fishing, as, the, albatrosses, and, other, seabirds, which, will, readily, feed, on, offal, are, attracted, to, the, set, bait, become, hooked, on, the, lines, and, drown, an, estimated, 100, 000, albatross, per, year, are, killed, in, this, fashion, unregulated, pirate, fisheries, exacerbate, the, problem, a, study, showed, that, potentially, illegal, longline, fishing, activities, are, highly, concentrated, in, areas, of, illegally, caught, fish, species, and, the, risk, to, bycatch, albatrosses, is, significantly, higher, in, areas, where, these, illegal, longline, fishing, vessels, operate, on, midway, atoll, collisions, between, laysan, albatrosses, and, aircraft, have, resulted, in, human, and, bird, deaths, as, well, as, severe, disruptions, in, military, flight, operations, studies, were, made, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, that, examined, the, results, of, control, methods, such, as, the, killing, of, birds, the, levelling, and, clearing, of, land, to, eliminate, updrafts, and, the, destruction, of, annual, nesting, sites, tall, structures, such, as, traffic, control, and, radio, towers, killed, 3000, birds, in, flight, collisions, during, 1964, 1965, before, the, towers, were, taken, down, closure, of, naval, air, facility, midway, in, 1993, eliminated, the, problem, of, collisions, with, military, aircraft, by, 2008, it, was, noted, that, reduction, in, human, activity, had, helped, reduce, bird, deaths, though, lead, paint, pollution, near, military, buildings, continued, to, poison, birds, by, ingestion, albatross, plumes, were, popular, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, 1909, alone, over, 300, 000, albatrosses, were, killed, on, midway, island, and, laysan, island, for, their, plumes, another, threat, to, albatrosses, is, introduced, species, such, as, rats, or, feral, cats, which, directly, attack, albatrosses, or, their, chicks, and, eggs, albatrosses, have, evolved, to, breed, on, islands, where, land, mammals, are, absent, and, have, not, developed, defences, against, them, even, species, as, small, as, mice, can, be, detrimental, on, gough, island, the, chicks, of, tristan, albatrosses, are, attacked, and, eaten, alive, by, introduced, house, mice, introduced, species, can, have, other, indirect, effects, cattle, overgrazed, essential, cover, on, amsterdam, island, threatening, the, amsterdam, albatross, on, other, islands, introduced, plants, reduce, potential, nesting, habitat, ingestion, of, plastic, flotsam, is, another, problem, one, faced, by, many, seabirds, the, amount, of, plastic, in, the, seas, has, increased, dramatically, since, the, first, record, in, the, 1960s, coming, from, waste, discarded, by, ships, offshore, dumping, litter, on, beaches, and, waste, washed, to, sea, by, rivers, it, is, impossible, to, digest, and, takes, up, space, in, the, stomach, or, gizzard, that, should, be, used, for, food, or, can, cause, an, obstruction, that, starves, the, bird, directly, studies, of, birds, in, the, north, pacific, have, shown, that, ingestion, of, plastics, results, in, declining, body, weight, and, body, condition, this, plastic, is, sometimes, regurgitated, and, fed, to, chicks, a, study, of, laysan, albatross, chicks, on, midway, atoll, showed, large, amounts, of, ingested, plastic, in, naturally, dead, chicks, compared, to, healthy, chicks, killed, in, accidents, while, not, the, direct, cause, of, death, this, plastic, causes, physiological, stress, and, causes, the, chick, to, feel, full, during, feedings, reducing, its, food, intake, and, the, chances, of, survival, scientists, and, conservationists, most, importantly, birdlife, international, and, their, partners, who, run, the, save, the, albatross, campaign, are, working, with, governments, and, fishermen, to, find, solutions, to, the, threats, albatrosses, face, techniques, such, as, setting, longline, bait, at, night, dyeing, the, bait, blue, setting, the, bait, underwater, increasing, the, amount, of, weight, on, lines, and, using, bird, scarers, can, all, reduce, the, seabird, bycatch, for, example, a, collaborative, study, between, scientists, and, fishermen, in, new, zealand, successfully, tested, an, underwater, setting, device, for, longliners, which, set, the, lines, below, the, reach, of, vulnerable, albatross, species, the, use, of, some, of, these, techniques, in, the, patagonian, toothfish, fishery, in, the, falkland, islands, is, thought, to, have, reduced, the, number, of, black, browed, albatrosses, taken, by, the, fleet, between, 1994, and, 2004, conservationists, have, also, worked, on, the, field, of, island, restoration, removing, introduced, species, that, threaten, native, wildlife, which, protects, albatrosses, from, introduced, predators, one, important, step, towards, protecting, albatrosses, and, other, seabirds, is, the, 2001, treaty, the, agreement, on, the, conservation, of, albatrosses, and, petrels, which, came, into, force, in, 2004, and, has, been, ratified, by, thirteen, countries, argentina, australia, brazil, chile, ecuador, france, new, zealand, norway, peru, south, africa, spain, the, united, kingdom, and, uruguay, the, treaty, requires, these, countries, to, take, specific, actions, to, reduce, bycatch, pollution, and, to, remove, introduced, species, from, nesting, islands, since, 1996, albatrosses, have, been, divided, into, four, genera, the, number, of, species, is, a, matter, of, debate, the, iucn, and, birdlife, international, recognise, 22, extant, species, listed, below, itis,
