see, text, the, old, world, flycatchers, are, a, large, family, the, muscicapidae, of, small, passerine, birds, restricted, to, the, old, world, europe, africa, and, asia, with, the, exception, of, several, vagrants, and, two, species, bluethroat, luscinia, svecica, and, northern, wheatear, oenanthe, oenanthe, found, also, in, north, america, these, are, mainly, small, arboreal, insectivores, many, of, which, as, the, name, implies, take, their, prey, on, the, wing, the, family, is, relatively, large, and, includes, 351, species, which, are, divided, into, 54, genera, the, name, muscicapa, for, the, family, was, introduced, by, the, scottish, naturalist, john, fleming, in, 1822, the, word, had, earlier, been, used, for, the, genus, muscicapa, by, the, french, zoologist, mathurin, jacques, brisson, in, 1760, muscicapa, comes, from, the, latin, musca, meaning, a, fly, and, capere, to, catch, in, 1910, the, german, ornithologist, ernst, hartert, found, it, impossible, to, define, boundaries, between, the, three, families, muscicapidae, sylviidae, old, world, warblers, and, turdidae, thrushes, he, therefore, treated, them, as, subfamilies, of, an, extended, flycatcher, family, that, also, included, timaliidae, old, world, babblers, and, monarchidae, monarch, flycatchers, forty, years, later, a, similar, arrangement, was, adopted, by, the, american, ornithologists, ernst, mayr, and, dean, amadon, in, an, article, published, in, 1951, their, large, family, muscicapidae, which, they, termed, the, primitive, insect, eaters, contained, 1460, species, divided, into, eight, subfamilies, the, use, of, the, extended, group, was, endorsed, by, a, committee, set, up, following, the, eleventh, international, ornithological, congress, held, in, basel, in, 1954, subsequent, dna, dna, hybridization, studies, by, charles, sibley, and, others, showed, that, the, subfamilies, were, not, closely, related, to, one, another, as, a, result, the, large, group, was, broken, up, into, a, number, of, separate, families, although, for, a, while, most, authorities, continued, to, retain, the, thrushes, in, muscicapidae, in, 1998, the, american, ornithologists, union, chose, to, treat, the, thrushes, as, a, separate, family, in, the, seventh, edition, of, their, check, list, of, north, american, birds, and, subsequently, most, authors, have, followed, their, example, the, family, formerly, included, fewer, species, at, the, time, of, the, publication, of, the, third, edition, of, howard, and, moore, complete, checklist, of, the, birds, of, the, world, in, 2003, the, genera, myophonus, alethe, brachypteryx, and, monticola, were, included, in, the, thrush, family, turdidae, subsequent, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, have, shown, that, the, species, in, these, four, genera, are, more, closely, related, to, species, in, muscicapidae, as, a, consequence, these, four, genera, are, now, placed, here, in, contrast, the, genus, cochoa, which, was, previously, placed, in, muscicapidae, has, been, shown, to, belong, in, turdidae, two, large, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, of, species, within, muscicapidae, published, in, 2010, showed, that, the, genera, fraseria, melaenornis, and, muscicapa, were, non, monophyletic, the, authors, were, unable, to, propose, revised, genera, as, not, all, the, species, were, sampled, and, not, all, the, nodes, in, their, phylogenies, were, strongly, supported, a, subsequent, study, published, in, 2016, that, included, 37, of, the, 42, muscicapini, species, confirmed, that, the, genera, were, non, monophyletic, and, proposed, a, reorganised, arrangement, of, the, species, with, several, new, or, resurrected, genera, the, international, ornithologists, union, recognises, 351, species, and, divides, the, family, into, 54, genera, subdivisions, have, been, proposed, by, sangster, et, al, 2010, for, a, complete, list, of, species, see, list, of, old, world, flycatcher, species, family, muscicapidae, the, cladogram, below, is, based, on, a, molecular, phylogenetic, study, of, the, family, by, min, zhao, and, collaborators, that, was, published, in, 2023, some, regions, of, the, phylogenetic, tree, were, not, strongly, supported, by, the, sequence, data, both, the, genera, included, and, the, number, of, species, in, each, genera, are, taken, from, the, list, of, birds, maintained, by, frank,
