in, nutrition, biology, and, chemistry, fat, usually, means, any, ester, of, fatty, acids, or, a, mixture, of, such, compounds, most, commonly, those, that, occur, in, living, beings, or, in, food, the, term, often, refers, specifically, to, triglycerides, triple, esters, of, glycerol, that, are, the, main, components, of, vegetable, oils, and, of, fatty, tissue, in, animals, or, even, more, narrowly, to, triglycerides, that, are, solid, or, semisolid, at, room, temperature, thus, excluding, oils, the, term, may, also, be, used, more, broadly, as, a, synonym, of, lipid, any, substance, of, biological, relevance, composed, of, carbon, hydrogen, or, oxygen, that, is, insoluble, in, water, but, soluble, in, non, polar, solvents, in, this, sense, besides, the, triglycerides, the, term, would, include, several, other, types, of, compounds, like, mono, and, diglycerides, phospholipids, such, as, lecithin, sterols, such, as, cholesterol, waxes, such, as, beeswax, and, free, fatty, acids, which, are, usually, present, in, human, diet, in, smaller, amounts, fats, are, one, of, the, three, main, macronutrient, groups, in, human, diet, along, with, carbohydrates, and, proteins, and, the, main, components, of, common, food, products, like, milk, butter, tallow, lard, salt, pork, and, cooking, oils, they, are, a, major, and, dense, source, of, food, energy, for, many, animals, and, play, important, structural, and, metabolic, functions, in, most, living, beings, including, energy, storage, waterproofing, and, thermal, insulation, the, human, body, can, produce, the, fat, it, requires, from, other, food, ingredients, except, for, a, few, essential, fatty, acids, that, must, be, included, in, the, diet, dietary, fats, are, also, the, carriers, of, some, flavor, and, aroma, ingredients, and, vitamins, that, are, not, water, soluble, in, humans, and, many, animals, fats, serve, both, as, energy, sources, and, as, stores, for, energy, in, excess, of, what, the, body, needs, immediately, each, gram, of, fat, when, burned, or, metabolized, releases, about, nine, food, calories, 37, kj, 8, 8, kcal, fats, are, also, sources, of, essential, fatty, acids, an, important, dietary, requirement, vitamins, a, d, e, and, k, are, fat, soluble, meaning, they, can, only, be, digested, absorbed, and, transported, in, conjunction, with, fats, fats, play, a, vital, role, in, maintaining, healthy, skin, and, hair, insulating, body, organs, against, shock, maintaining, body, temperature, and, promoting, healthy, cell, function, fat, also, serves, as, a, useful, buffer, against, a, host, of, diseases, when, a, particular, substance, whether, chemical, or, biotic, reaches, unsafe, levels, in, the, bloodstream, the, body, can, effectively, dilute, or, at, least, maintain, equilibrium, of, the, offending, substances, by, storing, it, in, new, fat, tissue, this, helps, to, protect, vital, organs, until, such, time, as, the, offending, substances, can, be, metabolized, or, removed, from, the, body, by, such, means, as, excretion, urination, accidental, or, intentional, bloodletting, sebum, excretion, and, hair, growth, in, animals, adipose, tissue, or, fatty, tissue, is, the, body, s, means, of, storing, metabolic, energy, over, extended, periods, of, time, adipocytes, fat, cells, store, fat, derived, from, the, diet, and, from, liver, metabolism, under, energy, stress, these, cells, may, degrade, their, stored, fat, to, supply, fatty, acids, and, also, glycerol, to, the, circulation, these, metabolic, activities, are, regulated, by, several, hormones, e, g, insulin, glucagon, and, epinephrine, adipose, tissue, also, secretes, the, hormone, leptin, a, variety, of, chemical, and, physical, techniques, are, used, for, the, production, and, processing, of, fats, both, industrially, and, in, cottage, or, home, settings, they, include, the, pancreatic, lipase, acts, at, the, ester, bond, hydrolyzing, the, bond, and, releasing, the, fatty, acid, in, triglyceride, form, lipids, cannot, be, absorbed, by, the, duodenum, fatty, acids, monoglycerides, one, glycerol, one, fatty, acid, and, some, diglycerides, are, absorbed, by, the, duodenum, once, the, triglycerides, have, been, broken, down, in, the, intestine, following, the, secretion, of, lipases, and, bile, triglycerides, are, split, into, monoacylglycerol, and, free, fatty, acids, in, a, process, called, lipolysis, they, are, subsequently, moved, to, absorptive, enterocyte, cells, lining, the, intestines, the, triglycerides, are, rebuilt, in, the, enterocytes, from, their, fragments, and, packaged, together, with, cholesterol, and, proteins, to, form, chylomicrons, these, are, excreted, from, the, cells, and, collected, by, the, lymph, system, and, transported, to, the, large, vessels, near, the, heart, before, being, mixed, into, the, blood, various, tissues, can, capture, the, chylomicrons, releasing, the, triglycerides, to, be, used, as, a, source, of, energy, liver, cells, can, synthesize, and, store, triglycerides, when, the, body, requires, fatty, acids, as, an, energy, source, the, hormone, glucagon, signals, the, breakdown, of, the, triglycerides, by, hormone, sensitive, lipase, to, release, free, fatty, acids, as, the, brain, cannot, utilize, fatty, acids, as, an, energy, source, unless, converted, to, a, ketone, the, glycerol, component, of, triglycerides, can, be, converted, into, glucose, via, gluconeogenesis, by, conversion, into, dihydroxyacetone, phosphate, and, then, into, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, for, brain, fuel, when, it, is, broken, down, fat, cells, may, also, be, broken, down, for, that, reason, if, the, brain, s, needs, ever, outweigh, the, body, s, triglycerides, cannot, pass, through, cell, membranes, freely, special, enzymes, on, the, walls, of, blood, vessels, called, lipoprotein, lipases, must, break, down, triglycerides, into, free, fatty, acids, and, glycerol, fatty, acids, can, then, be, taken, up, by, cells, via, fatty, acid, transport, proteins, fatps, triglycerides, as, major, components, of, very, low, density, lipoprotein, vldl, and, chylomicrons, play, an, important, role, in, metabolism, as, energy, sources, and, transporters, of, dietary, fat, they, contain, more, than, twice, as, much, energy, approximately, 9, kcal, g, or, 38, kj, g, as, carbohydrates, approximately, 4, kcal, g, or, 17, kj, g, the, most, common, type, of, fat, in, human, diet, and, most, living, beings, is, a, triglyceride, an, ester, of, the, triple, alcohol, glycerol, h, choh, 3, h, and, three, fatty, acids, the, molecule, of, a, triglyceride, can, be, described, as, resulting, from, a, condensation, reaction, specifically, esterification, between, each, of, glycerol, s, oh, groups, and, the, ho, part, of, the, carboxyl, group, ho, o, c, of, each, fatty, acid, forming, an, ester, bridge, o, o, c, with, elimination, of, a, water, molecule, h, 2, o, other, less, common, types, of, fats, include, diglycerides, and, monoglycerides, where, the, esterification, is, limited, to, two, or, just, one, of, glycerol, s, oh, groups, other, alcohols, such, as, cetyl, alcohol, predominant, in, spermaceti, may, replace, glycerol, in, the, phospholipids, one, of, the, fatty, acids, is, replaced, by, phosphoric, acid, or, a, monoester, thereof, the, benefits, and, risks, of, various, amounts, and, types, of, dietary, fats, have, been, the, object, of, much, study, and, are, still, highly, controversial, topics, there, are, two, essential, fatty, acids, efas, in, human, nutrition, alpha, linolenic, acid, an, omega, 3, fatty, acid, and, linoleic, acid, an, omega, 6, fatty, acid, the, adult, body, can, synthesize, other, lipids, that, it, needs, from, these, two, different, foods, contain, different, amounts, of, fat, with, different, proportions, of, saturated, and, unsaturated, fatty, acids, some, animal, products, like, beef, and, dairy, products, made, with, whole, or, reduced, fat, milk, like, yogurt, ice, cream, cheese, and, butter, have, mostly, saturated, fatty, acids, and, some, have, significant, contents, of, dietary, cholesterol, other, animal, products, like, pork, poultry, eggs, and, seafood, have, mostly, unsaturated, fats, industrialized, baked, goods, may, use, fats, with, high, unsaturated, fat, contents, as, well, especially, those, containing, partially, hydrogenated, oils, and, processed, foods, that, are, deep, fried, in, hydrogenated, oil, are, high, in, saturated, fat, content, plants, and, fish, oil, generally, contain, a, higher, proportion, of, unsaturated, acids, although, there, are, exceptions, such, as, coconut, oil, and, palm, kernel, oil, foods, containing, unsaturated, fats, include, avocado, nuts, olive, oils, and, vegetable, oils, such, as, canola, many, scientific, studies, have, found, that, replacing, saturated, fats, with, cis, unsaturated, fats, in, the, diet, reduces, risk, of, cardiovascular, diseases, cvds, diabetes, or, death, these, studies, prompted, many, medical, organizations, and, public, health, departments, including, the, world, health, organization, who, to, officially, issue, that, advice, some, countries, with, such, recommendations, include, a, 2004, review, concluded, that, no, lower, safe, limit, of, specific, saturated, fatty, acid, intakes, has, been, identified, and, recommended, that, the, influence, of, varying, saturated, fatty, acid, intakes, against, a, background, of, different, individual, lifestyles, and, genetic, backgrounds, should, be, the, focus, in, future, studies, this, advice, is, often, oversimplified, by, labeling, the, two, kinds, of, fats, as, bad, fats, and, good, fats, respectively, however, since, the, fats, and, oils, in, most, natural, and, traditionally, processed, foods, contain, both, unsaturated, and, saturated, fatty, acids, the, complete, exclusion, of, saturated, fat, is, unrealistic, and, possibly, unwise, for, instance, some, foods, rich, in, saturated, fat, such, as, coconut, and, palm, oil, are, an, important, source, of, cheap, dietary, calories, for, a, large, fraction, of, the, population, in, developing, countries, concerns, were, also, expressed, at, a, 2010, conference, of, the, american, dietetic, association, that, a, blanket, recommendation, to, avoid, saturated, fats, could, drive, people, to, also, reduce, the, amount, of, polyunsaturated, fats, which, may, have, health, benefits, and, or, replace, fats, by, refined, carbohydrates, which, carry, a, high, risk, of, obesity, and, heart, disease, for, these, reasons, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, for, example, recommends, to, consume, at, least, 10, 7, for, high, risk, groups, of, calories, from, saturated, fat, with, an, average, of, 30, or, less, of, total, calories, from, all, fat, a, general, 7, limit, was, recommended, also, by, the, american, heart, association, aha, in, 2006, the, who, fao, report, also, recommended, replacing, fats, so, as, to, reduce, the, content, of, myristic, and, palmitic, acids, specifically, the, so, called, mediterranean, diet, prevalent, in, many, countries, in, the, mediterranean, sea, area, includes, more, total, fat, than, the, diet, of, northern, european, countries, but, most, of, it, is, in, the, form, of, unsaturated, fatty, acids, specifically, monounsaturated, and, omega, 3, from, olive, oil, and, fish, vegetables, and, certain, meats, like, lamb, while, consumption, of, saturated, fat, is, minimal, in, comparison, a, 2017, review, found, evidence, that, a, mediterranean, style, diet, could, reduce, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, diseases, overall, cancer, incidence, neurodegenerative, diseases, diabetes, and, mortality, rate, a, 2018, review, showed, that, a, mediterranean, like, diet, may, improve, overall, health, status, such, as, reduced, risk, of, non, communicable, diseases, it, also, may, reduce, the, social, and, economic, costs, of, diet, related, illnesses, a, small, number, of, contemporary, reviews, have, challenged, this, negative, view, of, saturated, fats, for, example, an, evaluation, of, evidence, from, 1966, to, 1973, of, the, observed, health, impact, of, replacing, dietary, saturated, fat, with, linoleic, acid, found, that, it, increased, rates, of, death, from, all, causes, coronary, heart, disease, and, cardiovascular, disease, these, studies, have, been, disputed, by, many, scientists, and, the, consensus, in, the, medical, community, is, that, saturated, fat, and, cardiovascular, disease, are, closely, related, still, these, discordant, studies, fueled, debate, over, the, merits, of, substituting, polyunsaturated, fats, for, saturated, fats, the, effect, of, saturated, fat, on, cardiovascular, disease, has, been, extensively, studied, the, general, consensus, is, that, there, is, evidence, of, moderate, quality, of, a, strong, consistent, and, graded, relationship, between, saturated, fat, intake, blood, cholesterol, levels, and, the, incidence, of, cardiovascular, disease, the, relationships, are, accepted, as, causal, including, by, many, government, and, medical, organizations, a, 2017, review, by, the, aha, estimated, that, replacement, of, saturated, fat, with, polyunsaturated, fat, in, the, american, diet, could, reduce, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, diseases, by, 30, the, consumption, of, saturated, fat, is, generally, considered, a, risk, factor, for, dyslipidemia, abnormal, blood, lipid, levels, including, high, total, cholesterol, high, levels, of, triglycerides, high, levels, of, low, density, lipoprotein, ldl, bad, cholesterol, or, low, levels, of, high, density, lipoprotein, hdl, good, cholesterol, these, parameters, in, turn, are, believed, to, be, risk, indicators, for, some, types, of, cardiovascular, disease, these, effects, were, observed, in, children, too, several, meta, analyses, reviews, and, consolidations, of, multiple, previously, published, experimental, studies, have, confirmed, a, significant, relationship, between, saturated, fat, and, high, serum, cholesterol, levels, which, in, turn, have, been, claimed, to, have, a, causal, relation, with, increased, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, the, so, called, lipid, hypothesis, however, high, cholesterol, may, be, caused, by, many, factors, other, indicators, such, as, high, ldl, hdl, ratio, have, proved, to, be, more, predictive, in, a, study, of, myocardial, infarction, in, 52, countries, the, apob, apoa1, related, to, ldl, and, hdl, respectively, ratio, was, the, strongest, predictor, of, cvd, among, all, risk, factors, there, are, other, pathways, involving, obesity, triglyceride, levels, insulin, sensitivity, endothelial, function, and, thrombogenicity, among, others, that, play, a, role, in, cvd, although, it, seems, in, the, absence, of, an, adverse, blood, lipid, profile, the, other, known, risk, factors, have, only, a, weak, atherogenic, effect, different, saturated, fatty, acids, have, differing, effects, on, various, lipid, levels, the, evidence, for, a, relation, between, saturated, fat, intake, and, cancer, is, significantly, weaker, and, there, does, not, seem, to, be, a, clear, medical, consensus, about, it, various, animal, studies, have, indicated, that, the, intake, of, saturated, fat, has, a, negative, effect, on, the, mineral, density, of, bones, one, study, suggested, that, men, may, be, particularly, vulnerable, studies, have, shown, that, substituting, monounsaturated, fatty, acids, for, saturated, ones, is, associated, with, increased, daily, physical, activity, and, resting, energy, expenditure, more, physical, activity, less, anger, and, less, irritability, were, associated, with, a, higher, oleic, acid, diet, than, one, of, a, palmitic, acid, diet, the, most, common, fatty, acids, in, human, diet, are, unsaturated, or, mono, unsaturated, monounsaturated, fats, are, found, in, animal, flesh, such, as, red, meat, whole, milk, products, nuts, and, high, fat, fruits, such, as, olives, and, avocados, olive, oil, is, about, 75, monounsaturated, fat, the, high, oleic, variety, sunflower, oil, contains, at, least, 70, monounsaturated, fat, canola, oil, and, cashews, are, both, about, 58, monounsaturated, fat, tallow, beef, fat, is, about, 50, monounsaturated, fat, and, lard, is, about, 40, monounsaturated, fat, other, sources, include, hazelnut, avocado, oil, macadamia, nut, oil, grapeseed, oil, groundnut, oil, peanut, oil, sesame, oil, corn, oil, popcorn, whole, grain, wheat, cereal, oatmeal, almond, oil, hemp, oil, and, tea, oil, camellia, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, can, be, found, mostly, in, nuts, seeds, fish, seed, oils, and, oysters, food, sources, of, polyunsaturated, fats, include, mufas, especially, oleic, acid, have, been, found, to, lower, the, incidence, of, insulin, resistance, pufas, especially, large, amounts, of, arachidonic, acid, and, sfas, such, as, arachidic, acid, increased, it, these, ratios, can, be, indexed, in, the, phospholipids, of, human, skeletal, muscle, and, in, other, tissues, as, well, this, relationship, between, dietary, fats, and, insulin, resistance, is, presumed, secondary, to, the, relationship, between, insulin, resistance, and, inflammation, which, is, partially, modulated, by, dietary, fat, ratios, omega, 3, 6, 9, with, both, omega, 3, and, 9, thought, to, be, anti, inflammatory, and, omega, 6, pro, inflammatory, as, well, as, by, numerous, other, dietary, components, particularly, polyphenols, and, exercise, with, both, of, these, anti, inflammatory, although, both, pro, and, anti, inflammatory, types, of, fat, are, biologically, necessary, fat, dietary, ratios, in, most, us, diets, are, skewed, towards, omega, 6, with, subsequent, disinhibition, of, inflammation, and, potentiation, of, insulin, resistance, this, is, contrary, to, the, suggestion, that, polyunsaturated, fats, are, shown, to, be, protective, against, insulin, resistance, the, large, scale, kanwu, study, found, that, increasing, mufa, and, decreasing, sfa, intake, could, improve, insulin, sensitivity, but, only, when, the, overall, fat, intake, of, the, diet, was, low, however, some, mufas, may, promote, insulin, resistance, like, the, sfas, whereas, pufas, may, protect, against, it, levels, of, oleic, acid, along, with, other, mufas, in, red, blood, cell, membranes, were, positively, associated, with, breast, cancer, risk, the, saturation, index, si, of, the, same, membranes, was, inversely, associated, with, breast, cancer, risk, mufas, and, low, si, in, erythrocyte, membranes, are, predictors, of, postmenopausal, breast, cancer, both, of, these, variables, depend, on, the, activity, of, the, enzyme, delta, 9, desaturase, 9, d, results, from, observational, clinical, trials, on, pufa, intake, and, cancer, have, been, inconsistent, and, vary, by, numerous, factors, of, cancer, incidence, including, gender, and, genetic, risk, some, studies, have, shown, associations, between, higher, intakes, and, or, blood, levels, of, omega, 3, pufas, and, a, decreased, risk, of, certain, cancers, including, breast, and, colorectal, cancer, while, other, studies, found, no, associations, with, cancer, risk, polyunsaturated, fat, supplementation, was, found, to, have, no, effect, on, the, incidence, of, pregnancy, related, disorders, such, as, hypertension, or, preeclampsia, but, may, increase, the, length, of, gestation, slightly, and, decreased, the, incidence, of, early, premature, births, expert, panels, in, the, united, states, and, europe, recommend, that, pregnant, and, lactating, women, consume, higher, amounts, of, polyunsaturated, fats, than, the, general, population, to, enhance, the, dha, status, of, the, fetus, and, newborn, in, nature, unsaturated, fatty, acids, generally, have, double, bonds, in, cis, configuration, with, the, adjacent, c, c, bonds, on, the, same, side, as, opposed, to, trans, nevertheless, trans, fatty, acids, tfas, occur, in, small, amounts, in, meat, and, milk, of, ruminants, such, as, cattle, and, sheep, typically, 2, 5, of, total, fat, natural, tfas, which, include, conjugated, linoleic, acid, cla, and, vaccenic, acid, originate, in, the, rumen, of, these, animals, cla, has, two, double, bonds, one, in, the, cis, configuration, and, one, in, trans, which, makes, it, simultaneously, a, cis, and, a, trans, fatty, acid, concerns, about, trans, fatty, acids, in, human, diet, were, raised, when, they, were, found, to, be, an, unintentional, byproduct, of, the, partial, hydrogenation, of, vegetable, and, fish, oils, while, these, trans, fatty, acids, popularly, called, trans, fats, are, edible, they, have, been, implicated, in, many, health, problems, the, hydrogenation, process, invented, and, patented, by, wilhelm, normann, in, 1902, made, it, possible, to, turn, relatively, cheap, liquid, fats, such, as, whale, or, fish, oil, into, more, solid, fats, and, to, extend, their, shelf, life, by, preventing, rancidification, the, source, fat, and, the, process, were, initially, kept, secret, to, avoid, consumer, distaste, this, process, was, widely, adopted, by, the, food, industry, in, the, early, 1900s, first, for, the, production, of, margarine, a, replacement, for, butter, and, shortening, and, eventually, for, various, other, fats, used, in, snack, food, packaged, baked, goods, and, deep, fried, products, full, hydrogenation, of, a, fat, or, oil, produces, a, fully, saturated, fat, however, hydrogenation, generally, was, interrupted, before, completion, to, yield, a, fat, product, with, specific, melting, point, hardness, and, other, properties, partial, hydrogenation, turns, some, of, the, cis, double, bonds, into, trans, bonds, by, an, isomerization, reaction, the, trans, configuration, is, favored, because, it, is, the, lower, energy, form, this, side, reaction, accounts, for, most, of, the, trans, fatty, acids, consumed, today, by, far, an, analysis, of, some, industrialized, foods, in, 2006, found, up, to, 30, trans, fats, in, artificial, shortening, 10, in, breads, and, cake, products, 8, in, cookies, and, crackers, 4, in, salty, snacks, 7, in, cake, frostings, and, sweets, and, 26, in, margarine, and, other, processed, spreads, another, 2010, analysis, however, found, only, 0, 2, of, trans, fats, in, margarine, and, other, processed, spreads, up, to, 45, of, the, total, fat, in, those, foods, containing, man, made, trans, fats, formed, by, partially, hydrogenating, plant, fats, may, be, trans, fat, baking, shortenings, unless, reformulated, contain, around, 30, trans, fats, compared, to, their, total, fats, high, fat, dairy, products, such, as, butter, contain, about, 4, margarines, not, reformulated, to, reduce, trans, fats, may, contain, up, to, 15, trans, fat, by, weight, but, some, reformulated, ones, are, less, than, 1, trans, fat, high, levels, of, tfas, have, been, recorded, in, popular, fast, food, meals, an, analysis, of, samples, of, mcdonald, s, french, fries, collected, in, 2004, and, 2005, found, that, fries, served, in, new, york, city, contained, twice, as, much, trans, fat, as, in, hungary, and, 28, times, as, much, as, in, denmark, where, trans, fats, are, restricted, for, kentucky, fried, chicken, products, the, pattern, was, reversed, the, hungarian, product, containing, twice, the, trans, fat, of, the, new, york, product, even, within, the, united, states, there, was, variation, with, fries, in, new, york, containing, 30, more, trans, fat, than, those, from, atlanta, numerous, studies, have, found, that, consumption, of, tfas, increases, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, the, harvard, school, of, public, health, advises, that, replacing, tfas, and, saturated, fats, with, cis, monounsaturated, and, polyunsaturated, fats, is, beneficial, for, health, consuming, trans, fats, has, been, shown, to, increase, the, risk, of, coronary, artery, disease, in, part, by, raising, levels, of, low, density, lipoprotein, ldl, often, termed, bad, cholesterol, lowering, levels, of, high, density, lipoprotein, hdl, often, termed, good, cholesterol, increasing, triglycerides, in, the, bloodstream, and, promoting, systemic, inflammation, the, primary, health, risk, identified, for, trans, fat, consumption, is, an, elevated, risk, of, coronary, artery, disease, cad, a, 1994, study, estimated, that, over, 30, 000, cardiac, deaths, per, year, in, the, united, states, are, attributable, to, the, consumption, of, trans, fats, by, 2006, upper, estimates, of, 100, 000, deaths, were, suggested, a, comprehensive, review, of, studies, of, trans, fats, published, in, 2006, in, the, new, england, journal, of, medicine, reports, a, strong, and, reliable, connection, between, trans, fat, consumption, and, cad, concluding, that, on, a, per, calorie, basis, trans, fats, appear, to, increase, the, risk, of, cad, more, than, any, other, macronutrient, conferring, a, substantially, increased, risk, at, low, levels, of, consumption, 1, to, 3, of, total, energy, intake, the, major, evidence, for, the, effect, of, trans, fat, on, cad, comes, from, the, nurses, health, study, a, cohort, study, that, has, been, following, 120, 000, female, nurses, since, its, inception, in, 1976, in, this, study, hu, and, colleagues, analyzed, data, from, 900, coronary, events, from, the, study, s, population, during, 14, years, of, followup, he, determined, that, a, nurse, s, cad, risk, roughly, doubled, relative, risk, of, 1, 93, ci, 1, 43, to, 2, 61, for, each, 2, increase, in, trans, fat, calories, consumed, instead, of, carbohydrate, calories, by, contrast, for, each, 5, increase, in, saturated, fat, calories, instead, of, carbohydrate, calories, there, was, a, 17, increase, in, risk, relative, risk, of, 1, 17, ci, 0, 97, to, 1, 41, the, replacement, of, saturated, fat, or, trans, unsaturated, fat, by, cis, unhydrogenated, unsaturated, fats, was, associated, with, larger, reductions, in, risk, than, an, isocaloric, replacement, by, carbohydrates, hu, also, reports, on, the, benefits, of, reducing, trans, fat, consumption, replacing, 2, of, food, energy, from, trans, fat, with, non, trans, unsaturated, fats, more, than, halves, the, risk, of, cad, 53, by, comparison, replacing, a, larger, 5, of, food, energy, from, saturated, fat, with, non, trans, unsaturated, fats, reduces, the, risk, of, cad, by, 43, another, study, considered, deaths, due, to, cad, with, consumption, of, trans, fats, being, linked, to, an, increase, in, mortality, and, consumption, of, polyunsaturated, fats, being, linked, to, a, decrease, in, mortality, trans, fat, has, been, found, to, act, like, saturated, in, raising, the, blood, level, of, ldl, bad, cholesterol, but, unlike, saturated, fat, it, also, decreases, levels, of, hdl, good, cholesterol, the, net, increase, in, ldl, hdl, ratio, with, trans, fat, a, widely, accepted, indicator, of, risk, for, coronary, artery, disease, is, approximately, double, that, due, to, saturated, fat, one, randomized, crossover, study, published, in, 2003, comparing, the, effect, of, eating, a, meal, on, blood, lipids, of, relatively, cis, and, trans, fat, rich, meals, showed, that, cholesteryl, ester, transfer, cet, was, 28, higher, after, the, trans, meal, than, after, the, cis, meal, and, that, lipoprotein, concentrations, were, enriched, in, apolipoprotein, a, after, the, trans, meals, the, citokyne, test, is, a, potentially, more, reliable, indicator, of, cad, risk, although, is, still, being, studied, a, study, of, over, 700, nurses, showed, that, those, in, the, highest, quartile, of, trans, fat, consumption, had, blood, levels, of, c, reactive, protein, crp, that, were, 73, higher, than, those, in, the, lowest, quartile, it, has, been, established, that, trans, fats, in, human, breast, milk, fluctuate, with, maternal, consumption, of, trans, fat, and, that, the, amount, of, trans, fats, in, the, bloodstream, of, breastfed, infants, fluctuates, with, the, amounts, found, in, their, milk, in, 1999, reported, percentages, of, trans, fats, compared, to, total, fats, in, human, milk, ranged, from, 1, in, spain, 2, in, france, 4, in, germany, and, 7, in, canada, and, the, united, states, there, are, suggestions, that, the, negative, consequences, of, trans, fat, consumption, go, beyond, the, cardiovascular, risk, in, general, there, is, much, less, scientific, consensus, asserting, that, eating, trans, fat, specifically, increases, the, risk, of, other, chronic, health, problems, the, exact, biochemical, process, by, which, trans, fats, produce, specific, health, problems, are, a, topic, of, continuing, research, intake, of, dietary, trans, fat, perturbs, the, body, s, ability, to, metabolize, essential, fatty, acids, efas, including, omega, 3, leading, to, changes, in, the, phospholipid, fatty, acid, composition, of, the, arterial, walls, thereby, raising, risk, of, coronary, artery, disease, trans, double, bonds, are, claimed, to, induce, a, linear, conformation, to, the, molecule, favoring, its, rigid, packing, as, in, plaque, formation, the, geometry, of, the, cis, double, bond, in, contrast, is, claimed, to, create, a, bend, in, the, molecule, thereby, precluding, rigid, formations, while, the, mechanisms, through, which, trans, fatty, acids, contribute, to, coronary, artery, disease, are, fairly, well, understood, the, mechanism, for, their, effects, on, diabetes, is, still, under, investigation, they, may, impair, the, metabolism, of, long, chain, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, lcpufas, however, maternal, pregnancy, trans, fatty, acid, intake, has, been, inversely, associated, with, lcpufas, levels, in, infants, at, birth, thought, to, underlie, the, positive, association, between, breastfeeding, and, intelligence, trans, fats, are, processed, by, the, liver, differently, than, other, fats, they, may, cause, liver, dysfunction, by, interfering, with, delta, 6, desaturase, an, enzyme, involved, in, converting, essential, fatty, acids, to, arachidonic, acid, and, prostaglandins, both, of, which, are, important, to, the, functioning, of, cells, some, trans, fatty, acids, occur, in, natural, fats, and, traditionally, processed, foods, vaccenic, acid, occurs, in, breast, milk, and, some, isomers, of, conjugated, linoleic, acid, cla, are, found, in, meat, and, dairy, products, from, ruminants, butter, for, example, contains, about, 3, trans, fat, the, u, s, national, dairy, council, has, asserted, that, the, trans, fats, present, in, animal, foods, are, of, a, different, type, than, those, in, partially, hydrogenated, oils, and, do, not, appear, to, exhibit, the, same, negative, effects, a, review, agrees, with, the, conclusion, stating, that, the, sum, of, the, current, evidence, suggests, that, the, public, health, implications, of, consuming, trans, fats, from, ruminant, products, are, relatively, limited, but, cautions, that, this, may, be, due, to, the, low, consumption, of, trans, fats, from, animal, sources, compared, to, artificial, ones, in, 2008, a, meta, analysis, found, that, all, trans, fats, regardless, of, natural, or, artificial, origin, equally, raise, ldl, and, lower, hdl, levels, other, studies, though, have, shown, different, results, when, it, comes, to, animal, based, trans, fats, like, conjugated, linoleic, acid, cla, although, cla, is, known, for, its, anticancer, properties, researchers, have, also, found, that, the, cis, 9, trans, 11, form, of, cla, can, reduce, the, risk, for, cardiovascular, disease, and, help, fight, inflammation, two, canadian, studies, have, shown, that, vaccenic, acid, a, tfa, that, naturally, occurs, in, dairy, products, could, be, beneficial, compared, to, hydrogenated, vegetable, shortening, or, a, mixture, of, pork, lard, and, soy, fat, by, lowering, total, ldl, and, triglyceride, levels, a, study, by, the, us, department, of, agriculture, showed, that, vaccenic, acid, raises, both, hdl, and, ldl, cholesterol, whereas, industrial, trans, fats, only, raise, ldl, with, no, beneficial, effect, on, hdl, in, light, of, recognized, evidence, and, scientific, agreement, nutritional, authorities, consider, all, trans, fats, equally, harmful, for, health, and, recommend, that, their, consumption, be, reduced, to, trace, amounts, in, 2003, the, who, recommended, that, trans, fats, make, up, no, more, than, 0, 9, of, a, person, s, diet, and, in, 2018, introduced, a, 6, step, guide, to, eliminate, industrially, produced, trans, fatty, acids, from, the, global, food, supply, the, national, academy, of, sciences, nas, advises, the, u, s, and, canadian, governments, on, nutritional, science, for, use, in, public, policy, and, product, labeling, programs, their, 2002, dietary, reference, intakes, for, energy, carbohydrate, fiber, fat, fatty, acids, cholesterol, protein, and, amino, acids, contains, their, findings, and, recommendations, regarding, consumption, of, trans, fat, their, recommendations, are, based, on, two, key, facts, first, trans, fatty, acids, are, not, essential, and, provide, no, known, benefit, to, human, health, whether, of, animal, or, plant, origin, second, given, their, documented, effects, on, the, ldl, hdl, ratio, the, nas, concluded, that, dietary, trans, fatty, acids, are, more, deleterious, with, respect, to, coronary, artery, disease, than, saturated, fatty, acids, a, 2006, review, published, in, the, new, england, journal, of, medicine, nejm, that, states, from, a, nutritional, standpoint, the, consumption, of, trans, fatty, acids, results, in, considerable, potential, harm, but, no, apparent, benefit, because, of, these, facts, and, concerns, the, nas, has, concluded, there, is, no, safe, level, of, trans, fat, consumption, there, is, no, adequate, level, recommended, daily, amount, or, tolerable, upper, limit, for, trans, fats, this, is, because, any, incremental, increase, in, trans, fat, intake, increases, the, risk, of, coronary, artery, disease, despite, this, concern, the, nas, dietary, recommendations, have, not, included, eliminating, trans, fat, from, the, diet, this, is, because, trans, fat, is, naturally, present, in, many, animal, foods, in, trace, quantities, and, thus, its, removal, from, ordinary, diets, might, introduce, undesirable, side, effects, and, nutritional, imbalances, the, nas, has, thus, recommended, that, trans, fatty, acid, consumption, be, as, low, as, possible, while, consuming, a, nutritionally, adequate, diet, like, the, nas, the, who, has, tried, to, balance, public, health, goals, with, a, practical, level, of, trans, fat, consumption, recommending, in, 2003, that, trans, fats, be, limited, to, less, than, 1, of, overall, energy, intake, in, the, last, few, decades, there, has, been, substantial, amount, of, regulation, in, many, countries, limiting, trans, fat, contents, of, industrialized, and, commercial, food, products, the, negative, public, image, and, strict, regulations, has, led, to, interest, in, replacing, partial, hydrogenation, in, fat, interesterification, the, fatty, acids, are, among, a, mix, of, triglycerides, when, applied, to, a, suitable, blend, of, oils, and, saturated, fats, possibly, followed, by, separation, of, unwanted, solid, or, liquid, triglycerides, this, process, could, conceivably, achieve, results, similar, to, those, of, partial, hydrogenation, without, affecting, the, fatty, acids, themselves, in, particular, without, creating, any, new, trans, fat, hydrogenation, can, be, achieved, with, only, small, production, of, trans, fat, the, high, pressure, methods, produced, margarine, containing, 5, to, 6, trans, fat, based, on, current, u, s, labeling, requirements, see, below, the, manufacturer, could, claim, the, product, was, free, of, trans, fat, the, level, of, trans, fat, may, also, be, altered, by, modification, of, the, temperature, and, the, length, of, time, during, hydrogenation, one, can, mix, oils, such, as, olive, soybean, and, canola, water, monoglycerides, and, fatty, acids, to, form, a, cooking, fat, that, acts, the, same, way, as, trans, and, saturated, fats, the, 3, fatty, acids, have, received, substantial, attention, among, omega, 3, fatty, acids, neither, long, chain, nor, short, chain, forms, were, consistently, associated, with, breast, cancer, risk, high, levels, of, docosahexaenoic, acid, dha, however, the, most, abundant, omega, 3, polyunsaturated, fatty, acid, in, erythrocyte, red, blood, cell, membranes, were, associated, with, a, reduced, risk, of, breast, cancer, the, dha, obtained, through, the, consumption, of, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, is, positively, associated, with, cognitive, and, behavioral, performance, in, addition, dha, is, vital, for, the, grey, matter, structure, of, the, human, brain, as, well, as, retinal, stimulation, and, neurotransmission, some, studies, have, investigated, the, health, effects, of, interesterified, ie, fats, by, comparing, diets, with, ie, and, non, ie, fats, with, the, same, overall, fatty, acid, composition, several, experimental, studies, in, humans, found, no, statistical, difference, on, fasting, blood, lipids, between, a, diet, with, large, amounts, of, ie, fat, having, 25, 40, c16, 0, or, c18, 0, on, the, 2, position, and, a, similar, diet, with, non, ie, fat, having, only, 3, 9, c16, 0, or, c18, 0, on, the, 2, position, a, negative, result, was, obtained, also, in, a, study, that, compared, the, effects, on, blood, cholesterol, levels, of, an, ie, fat, product, mimicking, cocoa, butter, and, the, real, non, ie, product, a, 2007, study, funded, by, the, malaysian, palm, oil, board, claimed, that, replacing, natural, palm, oil, by, other, interesterified, or, partially, hydrogenated, fats, caused, adverse, health, effects, such, as, higher, ldl, hdl, ratio, and, plasma, glucose, levels, however, these, effects, could, be, attributed, to, the, higher, percentage, of, saturated, acids, in, the, ie, and, partially, hydrogenated, fats, rather, than, to, the, ie, process, itself, in, the, human, body, high, levels, of, triglycerides, in, the, bloodstream, have, been, linked, to, atherosclerosis, heart, disease, and, stroke, however, the, relative, negative, impact, of, raised, levels, of, triglycerides, compared, to, that, of, ldl, hdl, ratios, is, as, yet, unknown, the, risk, can, be, partly, accounted, for, by, a, strong, inverse, relationship, between, triglyceride, level, and, hdl, cholesterol, level, but, the, risk, is, also, due, to, high, triglyceride, levels, increasing, the, quantity, of, small, dense, ldl, particles, the, national, cholesterol, education, program, has, set, guidelines, for, triglyceride, levels, these, levels, are, tested, after, fasting, 8, to, 12, hours, triglyceride, levels, remain, temporarily, higher, for, a, period, after, eating, the, aha, recommends, an, optimal, triglyceride, level, of, 100, mg, dl, 1, 1, mmol, l, or, lower, to, improve, heart, health, lifestyle, changes, including, weight, loss, exercise, and, dietary, modification, may, improve, hypertriglyceridemia, this, may, include, dietary, changes, such, as, restriction, of, fat, and, carbohydrates, specifically, fructose, and, sugar, sweetened, beverages, and, increased, consumption, of, omega, 3, fatty, acids, from, algae, nuts, and, seeds, fats, are, broken, down, in, the, healthy, body, to, release, their, constituents, glycerol, and, fatty, acids, glycerol, itself, can, be, converted, to, glucose, by, the, liver, and, so, become, a, source, of, energy, fats, and, other, lipids, are, broken, down, in, the, body, by, enzymes, called, lipases, produced, in, the, pancreas, many, cell, types, can, use, either, glucose, or, fatty, acids, as, a, source, of, energy, for, metabolism, in, particular, heart, and, skeletal, muscle, prefer, fatty, acids, despite, long, standing, assertions, to, the, contrary, fatty, acids, can, also, be, used, as, a, source, of, fuel, for, brain, cells, through, mitochondrial, oxidation
