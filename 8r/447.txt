chaetopteridae, polychaeta, p, l, k, i, t, is, a, paraphyletic, class, of, generally, marine, annelid, worms, commonly, called, bristle, worms, or, polychaetes, p, l, k, i, t, s, each, body, segment, has, a, pair, of, fleshy, protrusions, called, parapodia, that, bear, many, bristles, called, chaetae, which, are, made, of, chitin, more, than, 10, 000, species, are, described, in, this, class, common, representatives, include, the, lugworm, arenicola, marina, and, the, sandworm, or, clam, worm, alitta, polychaetes, as, a, class, are, robust, and, widespread, with, species, that, live, in, the, coldest, ocean, temperatures, of, the, abyssal, plain, to, forms, which, tolerate, the, extremely, high, temperatures, near, hydrothermal, vents, polychaetes, occur, throughout, the, earth, s, oceans, at, all, depths, from, forms, that, live, as, plankton, near, the, surface, to, a, 2, to, 3, cm, specimen, still, unclassified, observed, by, the, robot, ocean, probe, nereus, at, the, bottom, of, the, challenger, deep, the, deepest, known, spot, in, the, earth, s, oceans, only, 168, species, less, than, 2, of, all, polychaetes, are, known, from, fresh, waters, polychaetes, are, segmented, worms, generally, less, than, 10, cm, 4, in, in, length, although, ranging, at, the, extremes, from, 1, mm, 0, 04, in, to, 3, m, 10, ft, in, eunice, aphroditois, they, can, sometimes, be, brightly, coloured, and, may, be, iridescent, or, even, luminescent, each, segment, bears, a, pair, of, paddle, like, and, highly, vascularized, parapodia, which, are, used, for, movement, and, in, many, species, act, as, the, worm, s, primary, respiratory, surfaces, bundles, of, bristles, called, chaetae, project, from, the, parapodia, however, polychaetes, vary, widely, from, this, generalized, pattern, and, can, display, a, range, of, different, body, forms, the, most, generalised, polychaetes, are, those, that, crawl, along, the, bottom, but, others, have, adapted, to, many, different, ecological, niches, including, burrowing, swimming, pelagic, life, tube, dwelling, or, boring, commensalism, and, parasitism, requiring, various, modifications, to, their, body, structures, the, head, or, prostomium, is, relatively, well, developed, compared, with, other, annelids, it, projects, forward, over, the, mouth, which, therefore, lies, on, the, animal, s, underside, the, head, normally, includes, two, to, four, pair, of, eyes, although, some, species, are, blind, these, are, typically, fairly, simple, structures, capable, of, distinguishing, only, light, and, dark, although, some, species, have, large, eyes, with, lenses, that, may, be, capable, of, more, sophisticated, vision, including, the, alciopids, complex, eyes, which, rival, cephalopod, and, vertebrate, eyes, many, species, show, bioluminescence, eight, families, have, luminous, species, the, head, also, includes, a, pair, of, antennae, tentacle, like, palps, and, a, pair, of, pits, lined, with, cilia, known, as, nuchal, organs, these, latter, appear, to, be, chemoreceptors, and, help, the, worm, to, seek, out, food, the, outer, surface, of, the, body, wall, consists, of, a, simple, columnar, epithelium, covered, by, a, thin, cuticle, underneath, this, in, order, are, a, thin, layer, of, connective, tissue, a, layer, of, circular, muscle, a, layer, of, longitudinal, muscle, and, a, peritoneum, surrounding, the, body, cavity, additional, oblique, muscles, move, the, parapodia, in, most, species, the, body, cavity, is, divided, into, separate, compartments, by, sheets, of, peritoneum, between, each, segment, but, in, some, species, it, is, more, continuous, the, mouth, of, polychaetes, is, located, on, the, peristomium, the, segment, behind, the, prostomium, and, varies, in, form, depending, on, their, diets, since, the, group, includes, predators, herbivores, filter, feeders, scavengers, and, parasites, in, general, however, they, possess, a, pair, of, jaws, and, a, pharynx, that, can, be, rapidly, everted, allowing, the, worms, to, grab, food, and, pull, it, into, their, mouths, in, some, species, the, pharynx, is, modified, into, a, lengthy, proboscis, the, digestive, tract, is, a, simple, tube, usually, with, a, stomach, part, way, along, the, smallest, species, and, those, adapted, to, burrowing, lack, gills, breathing, only, through, their, body, surfaces, most, other, species, have, external, gills, often, associated, with, the, parapodia, a, simple, but, well, developed, circulatory, system, is, usually, present, the, two, main, blood, vessels, furnish, smaller, vessels, to, supply, the, parapodia, and, the, gut, blood, flows, forward, in, the, dorsal, vessel, above, the, gut, and, returns, down, the, body, in, the, ventral, vessel, beneath, the, gut, the, blood, vessels, themselves, are, contractile, helping, to, push, the, blood, along, so, most, species, have, no, need, of, a, heart, in, a, few, cases, however, muscular, pumps, analogous, to, a, heart, are, found, in, various, parts, of, the, system, conversely, some, species, have, little, or, no, circulatory, system, at, all, transporting, oxygen, in, the, coelomic, fluid, that, fills, their, body, cavities, the, blood, may, be, colourless, or, have, any, of, three, different, respiratory, pigments, the, most, common, of, these, is, haemoglobin, but, some, groups, have, haemerythrin, or, the, green, coloured, chlorocruorin, instead, the, nervous, system, consists, of, a, single, or, double, ventral, nerve, cord, running, the, length, of, the, body, with, ganglia, and, a, series, of, small, nerves, in, each, segment, the, brain, is, relatively, large, compared, with, that, of, other, annelids, and, lies, in, the, upper, part, of, the, head, an, endocrine, gland, is, attached, to, the, ventral, posterior, surface, of, the, brain, and, appears, to, be, involved, in, reproductive, activity, in, addition, to, the, sensory, organs, on, the, head, photosensitive, eye, spots, statocysts, and, numerous, additional, sensory, nerve, endings, most, likely, involved, with, the, sense, of, touch, also, occur, on, the, body, polychaetes, have, a, varying, number, of, protonephridia, or, metanephridia, for, excreting, waste, which, in, some, cases, can, be, relatively, complex, in, structure, the, body, also, contains, greenish, chloragogen, tissue, similar, to, that, found, in, oligochaetes, which, appears, to, function, in, metabolism, in, a, similar, fashion, to, that, of, the, vertebrate, liver, the, cuticle, is, constructed, from, cross, linked, fibres, of, collagen, and, may, be, 200, nm, to, 13, mm, thick, their, jaws, are, formed, from, sclerotised, collagen, and, their, setae, from, sclerotised, chitin, polychaetes, are, predominantly, marine, but, many, species, also, live, in, freshwater, and, a, few, in, terrestrial, environments, they, are, extremely, variable, in, both, form, and, lifestyle, and, include, a, few, taxa, that, swim, among, the, plankton, or, above, the, abyssal, plain, most, burrow, or, build, tubes, in, the, sediment, and, some, live, as, commensals, a, few, species, roughly, 80, less, than, 0, 5, of, species, are, parasitic, these, include, both, ectoparasites, and, endoparasites, ectoparasitic, polychaetes, feed, on, skin, blood, and, other, secretions, and, some, are, adapted, to, bore, through, hard, usually, calcerous, surfaces, such, as, the, shells, of, mollusks, these, boring, polychaetes, may, be, parasitic, but, may, be, opportunistic, or, even, obligate, symbionts, commensals, the, mobile, forms, errantia, tend, to, have, well, developed, sense, organs, and, jaws, while, the, stationary, forms, sedentaria, lack, them, but, may, have, specialized, gills, or, tentacles, used, for, respiration, and, deposit, or, filter, feeding, e, g, fanworms, underwater, polychaetes, have, eversible, mouthparts, used, to, capture, prey, a, few, groups, have, evolved, to, live, in, terrestrial, environments, like, namanereidinae, with, many, terrestrial, species, but, are, restricted, to, humid, areas, some, have, even, evolved, cutaneous, invaginations, for, aerial, gas, exchange, most, polychaetes, have, separate, sexes, rather, than, being, hermaphroditic, the, most, primitive, species, have, a, pair, of, gonads, in, every, segment, but, most, species, exhibit, some, degree, of, specialisation, the, gonads, shed, immature, gametes, directly, into, the, body, cavity, where, they, complete, their, development, once, mature, the, gametes, are, shed, into, the, surrounding, water, through, ducts, or, openings, that, vary, between, species, or, in, some, cases, by, the, complete, rupture, of, the, body, wall, and, subsequent, death, of, the, adult, a, few, species, copulate, but, most, fertilize, their, eggs, externally, the, fertilized, eggs, typically, hatch, into, trochophore, larvae, which, float, among, the, plankton, and, eventually, metamorphose, into, the, adult, form, by, adding, segments, a, few, species, have, no, larval, form, with, the, egg, hatching, into, a, form, resembling, the, adult, and, in, many, that, do, have, larvae, the, trochophore, never, feeds, surviving, off, the, yolk, that, remains, from, the, egg, however, some, polychaetes, exhibit, remarkable, reproductive, strategies, some, species, reproduce, by, epitoky, for, much, of, the, year, these, worms, look, like, any, other, burrow, dwelling, polychaete, but, as, the, breeding, season, approaches, the, worm, undergoes, a, remarkable, transformation, as, new, specialized, segments, begin, to, grow, from, its, rear, end, until, the, worm, can, be, clearly, divided, into, two, halves, the, front, half, the, atoke, is, asexual, the, new, rear, half, responsible, for, breeding, is, known, as, the, epitoke, each, of, the, epitoke, segments, is, packed, with, eggs, and, sperm, and, features, a, single, eyespot, on, its, surface, the, beginning, of, the, last, lunar, quarter, is, the, cue, for, these, animals, to, breed, and, the, epitokes, break, free, from, the, atokes, and, float, to, the, surface, the, eye, spots, sense, when, the, epitoke, reaches, the, surface, and, the, segments, from, millions, of, worms, burst, releasing, their, eggs, and, sperm, into, the, water, a, similar, strategy, is, employed, by, the, deep, sea, worm, syllis, ramosa, which, lives, inside, a, sponge, the, rear, ends, of, the, worm, develop, into, stolons, containing, the, eggs, or, sperm, these, stolons, then, become, detached, from, the, parent, worm, and, rise, to, the, sea, surface, where, fertilisation, takes, place, stem, group, polychaete, fossils, are, known, from, the, sirius, passet, lagerst, tte, a, rich, sedimentary, deposit, in, greenland, tentatively, dated, to, the, late, atdabanian, early, cambrian, the, oldest, found, is, phragmochaeta, canicularis, many, of, the, more, famous, burgess, shale, organisms, such, as, canadia, may, also, have, polychaete, affinities, wiwaxia, long, interpreted, as, an, annelid, is, now, considered, to, represent, a, mollusc, an, even, older, fossil, cloudina, dates, to, the, terminal, ediacaran, period, this, has, been, interpreted, as, an, early, polychaete, although, consensus, is, absent, being, soft, bodied, organisms, the, fossil, record, of, polychaetes, is, dominated, by, their, fossilized, jaws, known, as, scolecodonts, and, the, mineralized, tubes, that, some, of, them, secrete, most, important, biomineralising, polychaetes, are, serpulids, sabellids, and, cirratulids, polychaete, cuticle, does, have, some, preservation, potential, it, tends, to, survive, for, at, least, 30, days, after, a, polychaete, s, death, although, biomineralisation, is, usually, necessary, to, preserve, soft, tissue, after, this, time, the, presence, of, polychaete, muscle, in, the, nonmineralised, burgess, shale, shows, this, need, not, always, be, the, case, their, preservation, potential, is, similar, to, that, of, jellyfish, taxonomically, polychaetes, are, thought, to, be, paraphyletic, meaning, the, group, excludes, some, descendants, of, its, most, recent, common, ancestor, groups, that, may, be, descended, from, the, polychaetes, include, the, clitellates, earthworms, and, leeches, sipunculans, and, echiurans, the, pogonophora, and, vestimentifera, were, once, considered, separate, phyla, but, are, now, classified, in, the, polychaete, family, siboglinidae, much, of, the, classification, below, matches, rouse, fauchald, 1998, although, that, paper, does, not, apply, ranks, above, family, older, classifications, recognize, many, more, sub, orders, than, the, layout, presented, here, as, comparatively, few, polychaete, taxa, have, been, subject, to, cladistic, analysis, some, groups, which, are, usually, considered, invalid, today, may, eventually, be, reinstated, these, divisions, were, shown, to, be, mostly, paraphyletic, in, recent, years
