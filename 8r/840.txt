pan, troglodytes, pan, paniscus, the, genus, pan, consists, of, two, extant, species, the, chimpanzee, and, the, bonobo, taxonomically, these, two, ape, species, are, collectively, termed, panins, the, two, species, were, formerly, collectively, called, chimpanzees, or, chimps, if, bonobos, were, recognized, as, a, separate, group, at, all, they, were, referred, to, as, pygmy, or, gracile, chimpanzees, together, with, humans, gorillas, and, orangutans, they, are, part, of, the, family, hominidae, the, great, apes, or, hominids, native, to, sub, saharan, africa, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, are, currently, both, found, in, the, congo, jungle, while, only, the, chimpanzee, is, also, found, further, north, in, west, africa, both, species, are, listed, as, endangered, on, the, iucn, red, list, of, threatened, species, and, in, 2017, the, convention, on, migratory, species, selected, the, chimpanzee, for, special, protection, the, chimpanzee, p, troglodytes, which, lives, north, of, the, congo, river, and, the, bonobo, p, paniscus, which, lives, south, of, it, were, once, considered, to, be, the, same, species, but, since, 1928, they, have, been, recognized, as, distinct, in, addition, p, troglodytes, is, divided, into, four, subspecies, while, p, paniscus, is, undivided, based, on, genome, sequencing, these, two, extant, pan, species, diverged, around, one, million, years, ago, the, most, obvious, differences, are, that, chimpanzees, are, somewhat, larger, more, aggressive, and, male, dominated, while, the, bonobos, are, more, gracile, peaceful, and, female, dominated, their, hair, is, typically, black, or, brown, males, and, females, differ, in, size, and, appearance, both, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, are, some, of, the, most, social, great, apes, with, social, bonds, occurring, throughout, large, communities, fruit, is, the, most, important, component, of, a, chimpanzee, s, diet, but, they, will, also, eat, vegetation, bark, honey, insects, and, even, other, chimpanzees, or, monkeys, they, can, live, over, 30, years, in, both, the, wild, and, captivity, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, are, equally, humanity, s, closest, living, relatives, they, use, a, variety, of, sophisticated, tools, and, construct, elaborate, sleeping, nests, each, night, from, branches, and, foliage, their, learning, abilities, have, been, extensively, studied, there, may, even, be, distinctive, cultures, within, populations, field, studies, of, pan, troglodytes, were, pioneered, by, primatologist, jane, goodall, the, genus, name, pan, was, first, introduced, by, lorenz, oken, in, 1816, while, oken, did, not, give, a, rationale, for, his, choice, it, is, generally, thought, to, have, been, inspired, by, the, name, of, the, greek, god, pan, an, alternative, theranthropus, was, suggested, by, brookes, 1828, and, chimpansee, by, voigt, 1831, troglodytes, was, not, available, as, it, had, been, given, as, the, name, of, a, genus, of, wren, in, 1809, for, cave, dweller, reflecting, the, tendency, of, some, wrens, to, forage, in, dark, crevices, the, international, commission, on, zoological, nomenclature, adopted, pan, as, the, only, official, name, of, the, genus, in, 1895, though, the, cave, dweller, connection, was, able, to, be, included, albeit, at, the, species, level, pan, troglodytes, the, common, chimpanzee, for, one, of, the, two, species, of, pan, the, first, use, of, the, name, chimpanze, is, recorded, in, the, london, magazine, in, 1738, glossed, as, meaning, mockman, in, a, language, of, the, angolans, apparently, from, a, bantu, language, reportedly, modern, vili, civili, a, zone, h, bantu, language, has, the, comparable, ci, mpenzi, the, spelling, chimpanzee, is, found, in, a, 1758, supplement, to, chamber, s, cyclop, dia, the, colloquialism, chimp, was, most, likely, coined, some, time, in, the, late, 1870s, the, chimpanzee, was, named, simia, troglodytes, by, johann, friedrich, blumenbach, in, 1776, the, species, name, troglodytes, is, a, reference, to, the, troglodytae, literally, cave, goers, an, african, people, described, by, greco, roman, geographers, blumenbach, first, used, it, in, his, de, generis, humani, varietate, nativa, liber, on, the, natural, varieties, of, the, human, genus, in, 1776, linnaeus, 1758, had, already, used, homo, troglodytes, for, a, hypothetical, mixture, of, human, and, orangutan, the, bonobo, in, the, past, also, referred, to, as, the, pygmy, chimpanzee, was, given, the, species, name, of, paniscus, by, ernst, schwarz, 1929, a, greek, style, diminutive, of, the, theonym, pan, used, by, cicero, there, are, two, species, of, the, genus, pan, both, previously, called, simply, chimpanzees, unknown, unknown, gibbons, family, hylobatidae, orangutans, genus, pongo, gorillas, genus, gorilla, humans, genus, homo, chimpanzees, genus, pan, the, genus, pan, is, part, of, the, subfamily, homininae, to, which, humans, also, belong, the, lineages, of, chimpanzees, and, humans, separated, in, a, process, of, speciation, between, roughly, five, to, twelve, million, years, ago, making, them, humanity, s, closest, living, relative, research, by, mary, claire, king, in, 1973, found, 99, identical, dna, between, human, beings, and, chimpanzees, for, some, time, research, modified, that, finding, to, about, 94, commonality, with, some, of, the, difference, occurring, in, noncoding, dna, but, more, recent, knowledge, puts, the, difference, in, dna, between, humans, chimpanzees, and, bonobos, at, just, about, 1, 1, 2, again, the, chimpanzee, fossil, record, has, long, been, absent, and, thought, to, have, been, due, to, the, preservation, bias, in, relation, to, their, environment, however, in, 2005, chimpanzee, fossils, were, discovered, and, described, by, sally, mcbrearty, and, colleagues, existing, chimpanzee, populations, in, west, and, central, africa, are, separate, from, the, major, human, fossil, sites, in, east, africa, however, chimpanzee, fossils, have, been, reported, from, kenya, indicating, that, both, humans, and, members, of, the, pan, clade, were, present, in, the, east, african, rift, valley, during, the, middle, pleistocene, the, chimpanzee, s, arms, are, longer, than, its, legs, the, male, common, chimp, stands, up, to, 1, 2, m, 3, 9, ft, high, male, adult, wild, chimps, weigh, between, 40, and, 60, kg, with, females, weighing, between, 27, and, 50, kg, when, extended, the, common, chimp, s, long, arms, span, one, and, a, half, times, the, body, s, height, the, bonobo, is, slightly, shorter, and, thinner, than, the, common, chimpanzee, but, has, longer, limbs, in, trees, both, species, climb, with, their, long, powerful, arms, on, the, ground, chimpanzees, usually, knuckle, walk, or, walk, on, all, fours, clenching, their, fists, and, supporting, themselves, on, the, knuckles, chimpanzees, are, better, suited, for, walking, than, orangutans, because, the, chimp, s, feet, have, broader, soles, and, shorter, toes, the, bonobo, has, proportionately, longer, upper, limbs, and, walks, upright, more, often, than, does, the, common, chimpanzee, both, species, can, walk, upright, on, two, legs, when, carrying, objects, with, their, hands, and, arms, the, chimpanzee, is, tailless, its, coat, is, dark, its, face, fingers, palms, of, the, hands, and, soles, of, the, feet, are, hairless, the, exposed, skin, of, the, face, hands, and, feet, varies, from, pink, to, very, dark, in, both, species, but, is, generally, lighter, in, younger, individuals, and, darkens, with, maturity, a, university, of, chicago, medical, centre, study, has, found, significant, genetic, differences, between, chimpanzee, populations, a, bony, shelf, over, the, eyes, gives, the, forehead, a, receding, appearance, and, the, nose, is, flat, although, the, jaws, protrude, a, chimp, s, lips, are, thrust, out, only, when, it, pouts, the, brain, of, a, chimpanzee, has, been, measured, at, a, general, range, of, 282, 500, cm, 3, the, human, brain, in, contrast, is, about, three, times, larger, with, a, reported, average, volume, of, about, 1330, cm, 3, chimpanzees, reach, puberty, between, the, age, of, eight, and, ten, years, a, chimpanzee, s, testicles, are, unusually, large, for, its, body, size, with, a, combined, weight, of, about, 4, oz, 110, g, compared, to, a, gorilla, s, 1, oz, 28, g, or, a, human, s, 1, 5, ounces, 43, g, this, relatively, great, size, is, generally, attributed, to, sperm, competition, due, to, the, polygynandrous, nature, of, chimpanzee, mating, behaviour, in, the, wild, chimpanzees, live, to, their, 30s, while, some, captured, chimps, have, reached, an, age, of, 70, years, and, older, chimpanzees, are, known, for, possessing, great, amount, of, muscle, strength, especially, in, their, arms, however, compared, to, humans, the, amount, of, strength, reported, in, media, and, popular, science, is, greatly, exaggerated, with, numbers, of, four, to, eight, times, the, muscle, strength, of, a, human, these, numbers, stem, from, two, studies, in, 1923, and, 1926, by, a, biologist, named, john, bauman, these, studies, were, refuted, in, 1943, and, an, adult, male, chimpanzee, was, found, to, pull, about, the, same, weight, as, an, adult, man, corrected, for, their, smaller, body, sizes, chimpanzees, were, found, to, be, stronger, than, humans, but, not, anywhere, near, four, to, eight, times, in, the, 1960s, these, tests, were, repeated, and, chimpanzees, were, found, to, have, twice, the, strength, of, a, human, when, it, came, to, pulling, weights, the, reason, for, the, higher, strength, seen, in, chimpanzees, compared, to, humans, are, thought, to, come, from, longer, skeletal, muscle, fibers, that, can, generate, twice, the, work, output, over, a, wider, range, of, motion, compared, to, skeletal, muscle, fibers, in, humans, it, is, suspected, that, human, observers, can, influence, chimpanzee, behaviour, for, this, reason, researchers, sometimes, prefer, camera, traps, and, remote, microphones, rather, than, human, observers, anatomical, differences, between, the, common, chimpanzee, and, the, bonobo, are, slight, both, are, omnivorous, adapted, to, a, mainly, frugivorous, diet, yet, sexual, and, social, behaviours, are, markedly, different, the, common, chimpanzee, has, a, troop, culture, based, on, beta, males, led, by, an, alpha, male, and, highly, complex, social, relationships, the, bonobo, on, the, other, hand, has, egalitarian, nonviolent, matriarchal, sexually, receptive, behaviour, bonobos, frequently, have, sex, sometimes, to, help, prevent, and, resolve, conflicts, different, groups, of, chimpanzees, also, have, different, cultural, behaviour, with, preferences, for, types, of, tools, the, common, chimpanzee, tends, to, display, greater, aggression, than, does, the, bonobo, the, average, captive, chimpanzee, sleeps, 9, hours, and, 42, minutes, per, day, contrary, to, what, the, scientific, name, pan, troglodytes, may, suggest, chimpanzees, do, not, typically, spend, their, time, in, caves, but, there, have, been, reports, of, some, of, them, seeking, refuge, in, caves, because, of, the, heat, during, daytime, chimpanzees, live, in, large, multi, male, and, multi, female, social, groups, which, are, called, communities, within, a, community, the, position, of, an, individual, and, the, influence, the, individual, has, on, others, dictates, a, definite, social, hierarchy, chimpanzees, live, in, a, leaner, hierarchy, wherein, more, than, one, individual, may, be, dominant, enough, to, dominate, other, members, of, lower, rank, typically, a, dominant, male, is, referred, to, as, the, alpha, male, the, alpha, male, is, the, highest, ranking, male, that, controls, the, group, and, maintains, order, during, disputes, in, chimpanzee, society, the, dominant, male, sometimes, is, not, the, largest, or, strongest, male, but, rather, the, most, manipulative, and, political, male, that, can, influence, the, goings, on, within, a, group, male, chimpanzees, typically, attain, dominance, by, cultivating, allies, who, will, support, that, individual, during, future, ambitions, for, power, the, alpha, male, regularly, displays, by, puffing, his, normally, slim, coat, up, to, increase, view, size, and, charge, to, seem, as, threatening, and, as, powerful, as, possible, this, behaviour, serves, to, intimidate, other, members, and, thereby, maintain, power, and, authority, and, it, may, be, fundamental, to, the, alpha, male, s, holding, on, to, his, status, lower, ranking, chimpanzees, will, show, respect, by, submissively, gesturing, in, body, language, or, reaching, out, their, hands, while, grunting, female, chimpanzees, will, show, deference, to, the, alpha, male, by, presenting, their, hindquarters, female, chimpanzees, also, have, a, hierarchy, which, is, influenced, by, the, position, of, a, female, individual, within, a, group, in, some, chimpanzee, communities, the, young, females, may, inherit, high, status, from, a, high, ranking, mother, dominant, females, will, also, ally, to, dominate, lower, ranking, females, whereas, males, mainly, seek, dominant, status, for, its, associated, mating, privileges, and, sometimes, violent, domination, of, subordinates, females, seek, dominant, status, to, acquire, resources, such, as, food, as, high, ranking, females, often, have, first, access, to, them, both, genders, acquire, dominant, status, to, improve, social, standing, within, a, group, community, female, acceptance, is, necessary, for, alpha, male, status, females, must, ensure, that, their, group, visits, places, that, supply, them, with, enough, food, a, group, of, dominant, females, will, sometimes, oust, an, alpha, male, which, is, not, to, their, preference, and, back, another, male, in, whom, they, see, potential, for, leading, the, group, as, a, successful, alpha, male, the, mating, system, within, each, community, is, polygynandrous, with, each, male, and, female, possibly, having, multiple, sexual, partners, chimpanzees, make, tools, and, use, them, to, acquire, foods, and, for, social, displays, they, have, sophisticated, hunting, strategies, requiring, cooperation, influence, and, rank, they, are, status, conscious, manipulative, and, capable, of, deception, they, can, learn, to, use, symbols, and, understand, aspects, of, human, language, including, some, relational, syntax, concepts, of, number, and, numerical, sequence, and, they, are, capable, of, spontaneous, planning, for, a, future, state, or, event, in, october, 1960, jane, goodall, observed, the, use, of, tools, among, chimpanzees, recent, research, indicates, that, chimpanzees, use, of, stone, tools, dates, back, at, least, 4, 300, years, about, 2, 300, bc, one, example, of, chimpanzee, tool, usage, behavior, includes, the, use, of, a, large, stick, as, a, tool, to, dig, into, termite, mounds, and, the, subsequent, use, of, a, small, stick, altered, into, a, tool, that, is, used, to, fish, the, termites, out, of, the, mound, chimpanzees, are, also, known, to, use, smaller, stones, as, hammers, and, a, large, one, as, an, anvil, in, order, to, break, open, nuts, in, the, 1970s, reports, of, chimpanzees, using, rocks, or, sticks, as, weapons, were, anecdotal, and, controversial, however, a, 2007, study, claimed, to, reveal, the, use, of, spears, which, common, chimpanzees, in, senegal, sharpen, with, their, teeth, and, use, to, stab, and, pry, senegal, bushbabies, out, of, small, holes, in, trees, prior, to, the, discovery, of, tool, use, by, chimpanzees, humans, were, believed, to, be, the, only, species, to, make, and, use, tools, however, several, other, tool, using, species, are, now, known, nest, building, sometimes, considered, to, be, a, form, of, tool, use, is, seen, when, chimpanzees, construct, arboreal, night, nests, by, lacing, together, branches, from, one, or, more, trees, to, build, a, safe, comfortable, place, to, sleep, infants, learn, this, process, by, watching, their, mothers, the, nest, provides, a, sort, of, mattress, which, is, supported, by, strong, branches, for, a, foundation, and, then, lined, with, softer, leaves, and, twigs, the, minimum, diameter, is, 5, metres, 16, ft, and, may, be, located, at, a, height, of, 3, to, 45, metres, 10, to, 150, ft, both, day, and, night, nests, are, built, and, may, be, located, in, groups, a, study, in, 2014, found, that, the, muhimbi, tree, is, favoured, for, nest, building, by, chimpanzees, in, uganda, due, to, its, physical, properties, such, as, bending, strength, inter, node, distance, and, leaf, surface, area, studies, have, shown, chimpanzees, engage, in, apparently, altruistic, behaviour, within, groups, some, researchers, have, suggested, that, chimpanzees, are, indifferent, to, the, welfare, of, unrelated, group, members, but, a, more, recent, study, of, wild, chimpanzees, found, that, both, male, and, female, adults, would, adopt, orphaned, young, of, their, group, also, different, groups, sometimes, share, food, form, coalitions, and, cooperate, in, hunting, and, border, patrolling, sometimes, chimpanzees, have, adopted, young, that, come, from, unrelated, groups, and, in, some, rare, cases, even, male, chimpanzees, have, been, shown, to, take, care, of, abandoned, infant, chimpanzees, of, an, unrelated, group, though, in, most, cases, they, would, kill, the, infant, according, to, a, literature, summary, by, james, w, harrod, evidence, for, chimpanzee, emotivity, includes, display, of, mourning, incipient, romantic, love, rain, dances, appreciation, of, natural, beauty, such, as, a, sunset, over, a, lake, curiosity, and, respect, towards, other, wildlife, such, as, the, python, which, is, neither, a, threat, nor, a, food, source, to, chimpanzees, altruism, toward, other, species, such, as, feeding, turtles, and, animism, or, pretend, play, when, chimpanzees, cradle, and, groom, rocks, or, sticks, chimpanzees, communicate, in, a, manner, that, is, similar, to, that, of, human, nonverbal, communication, using, vocalizations, hand, gestures, and, facial, expressions, there, is, some, evidence, that, they, can, recreate, human, speech, research, into, the, chimpanzee, brain, has, revealed, that, when, chimpanzees, communicate, an, area, in, the, brain, is, activated, which, is, in, the, same, position, as, the, language, center, called, broca, s, area, in, human, brains, adult, common, chimpanzees, particularly, males, can, be, very, aggressive, they, are, highly, territorial, and, are, known, to, kill, others, of, their, species, chimpanzees, also, engage, in, targeted, hunting, of, smaller, primates, such, as, the, red, colobus, and, bush, babies, males, who, acquire, the, meat, may, share, it, with, females, to, have, sex, or, for, grooming, in, february, 2013, a, study, found, that, chimpanzees, solve, puzzles, for, entertainment, chimpanzees, as, well, as, other, apes, had, also, been, purported, to, have, been, known, to, ancient, writers, but, mainly, as, myths, and, legends, on, the, edge, of, european, and, near, eastern, societal, consciousness, apes, are, mentioned, variously, by, aristotle, the, english, word, ape, translates, hebrew, qof, in, english, translations, of, the, bible, 1, kings, 10, 22, but, the, word, may, refer, to, a, monkey, rather, than, an, ape, proper, the, diary, of, portuguese, explorer, duarte, pacheco, pereira, 1506, preserved, in, the, portuguese, national, archive, torre, do, tombo, is, probably, the, first, written, document, to, acknowledge, that, chimpanzees, built, their, own, rudimentary, tools, the, first, of, these, early, transcontinental, chimpanzees, came, from, angola, and, were, presented, as, a, gift, to, frederick, henry, prince, of, orange, in, 1640, and, were, followed, by, a, few, of, its, brethren, over, the, next, several, years, scientists, described, these, first, chimpanzees, as, pygmies, and, noted, the, animals, distinct, similarities, to, humans, the, next, two, decades, a, number, of, the, creatures, were, imported, into, europe, mainly, acquired, by, various, zoological, gardens, as, entertainment, for, visitors, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, natural, selection, published, in, 1859, spurred, scientific, interest, in, chimpanzees, as, in, much, of, life, science, leading, eventually, to, numerous, studies, of, the, animals, in, the, wild, and, captivity, the, observers, of, chimpanzees, at, the, time, were, mainly, interested, in, behaviour, as, it, related, to, that, of, humans, this, was, less, strictly, and, disinterestedly, scientific, than, it, might, sound, with, much, attention, being, focused, on, whether, or, not, the, animals, had, traits, that, could, be, considered, good, the, intelligence, of, chimpanzees, was, often, significantly, exaggerated, as, immortalized, in, hugo, rheinhold, s, affe, mit, sch, del, see, image, left, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, chimpanzees, remained, very, much, a, mystery, to, humans, with, very, little, factual, scientific, information, available, in, the, 20th, century, a, new, age, of, scientific, research, into, chimpanzee, behaviour, began, before, 1960, almost, nothing, was, known, about, chimpanzee, behaviour, in, their, natural, habitats, in, july, of, that, year, jane, goodall, set, out, to, tanzania, s, gombe, forest, to, live, among, the, chimpanzees, where, she, primarily, studied, the, members, of, the, kasakela, chimpanzee, community, her, discovery, that, chimpanzees, made, and, used, tools, was, groundbreaking, as, humans, were, previously, believed, to, be, the, only, species, to, do, so, the, most, progressive, early, studies, on, chimpanzees, were, spearheaded, primarily, by, wolfgang, k, hler, and, robert, yerkes, both, of, whom, were, renowned, psychologists, both, men, and, their, colleagues, established, laboratory, studies, of, chimpanzees, focused, specifically, on, learning, about, the, intellectual, abilities, of, chimpanzees, particularly, problem, solving, this, typically, involved, basic, practical, tests, on, laboratory, chimpanzees, which, required, a, fairly, high, intellectual, capacity, such, as, how, to, solve, the, problem, of, acquiring, an, out, of, reach, banana, notably, yerkes, also, made, extensive, observations, of, chimpanzees, in, the, wild, which, added, tremendously, to, the, scientific, understanding, of, chimpanzees, and, their, behaviour, yerkes, studied, chimpanzees, until, world, war, ii, while, k, hler, concluded, five, years, of, study, and, published, his, famous, mentality, of, apes, in, 1925, which, is, coincidentally, when, yerkes, began, his, analyses, eventually, concluding, chimpanzees, manifest, intelligent, behaviour, of, the, general, kind, familiar, in, human, beings, a, type, of, behaviour, which, counts, as, specifically, human, 1925, the, august, 2008, issue, of, the, american, journal, of, primatology, reported, results, of, a, year, long, study, of, chimpanzees, in, tanzania, s, mahale, mountains, national, park, which, produced, evidence, of, chimpanzees, becoming, sick, from, viral, infectious, diseases, they, had, likely, contracted, from, humans, molecular, microscopic, and, epidemiological, investigations, demonstrated, the, chimpanzees, living, at, mahale, mountains, national, park, have, been, suffering, from, a, respiratory, disease, that, is, likely, caused, by, a, variant, of, a, human, paramyxovirus, the, us, fish, and, wildlife, service, finalized, a, rule, on, june, 12, 2015, creating, very, strict, regulations, practically, barring, any, activity, with, chimpanzees, other, than, for, scientific, preservation, oriented, purposes
