in, botany, a, seed, is, a, plant, embryo, and, food, reserve, enclosed, in, a, protective, outer, covering, called, a, seed, coat, testa, more, generally, the, term, seed, means, anything, that, can, be, sown, which, may, include, seed, and, husk, or, tuber, seeds, are, the, product, of, the, ripened, ovule, after, the, embryo, sac, is, fertilized, by, sperm, from, pollen, forming, a, zygote, the, embryo, within, a, seed, develops, from, the, zygote, and, grows, within, the, mother, plant, to, a, certain, size, before, growth, is, halted, the, formation, of, the, seed, is, the, defining, part, of, the, process, of, reproduction, in, seed, plants, spermatophytes, other, plants, such, as, ferns, mosses, and, liverworts, do, not, have, seeds, and, use, water, dependent, means, to, propagate, themselves, seed, plants, now, dominate, biological, niches, on, land, from, forests, to, grasslands, both, in, hot, and, cold, climates, in, the, flowering, plants, the, ovary, ripens, into, a, fruit, which, contains, the, seed, and, serves, to, disseminate, it, many, structures, commonly, referred, to, as, seeds, are, actually, dry, fruits, sunflower, seeds, are, sometimes, sold, commercially, while, still, enclosed, within, the, hard, wall, of, the, fruit, which, must, be, split, open, to, reach, the, seed, different, groups, of, plants, have, other, modifications, the, so, called, stone, fruits, such, as, the, peach, have, a, hardened, fruit, layer, the, endocarp, fused, to, and, surrounding, the, actual, seed, nuts, are, the, one, seeded, hard, shelled, fruit, of, some, plants, with, an, indehiscent, seed, such, as, an, acorn, or, hazelnut, the, first, land, plants, evolved, around, 468, million, years, ago, and, reproduced, using, spores, the, earliest, seed, bearing, plants, to, appear, were, the, gymnosperms, which, have, no, ovaries, to, contain, the, seeds, they, arose, during, the, late, devonian, period, 416, million, to, 358, million, years, ago, from, these, early, gymnosperms, seed, ferns, evolved, during, the, carboniferous, period, 359, to, 299, million, years, ago, they, had, ovules, that, were, borne, in, a, cupule, which, consisted, of, groups, of, enclosing, branches, likely, used, to, protect, the, developing, seed, published, literature, about, seed, storage, viability, and, its, hygrometric, dependence, began, in, the, early, 19th, century, influential, works, being, angiosperm, seeds, are, enclosed, seeds, produced, in, a, hard, or, fleshy, structure, called, a, fruit, that, encloses, them, for, protection, some, fruits, have, layers, of, both, hard, and, fleshy, material, in, gymnosperms, no, special, structure, develops, to, enclose, the, seeds, which, begin, their, development, naked, on, the, bracts, of, cones, however, the, seeds, do, become, covered, by, the, cone, scales, as, they, develop, in, some, species, of, conifer, angiosperm, flowering, plants, seeds, consist, of, three, genetically, distinct, constituents, 1, the, embryo, formed, from, the, zygote, 2, the, endosperm, which, is, normally, triploid, 3, the, seed, coat, from, tissue, derived, from, the, maternal, tissue, of, the, ovule, in, angiosperms, the, process, of, seed, development, begins, with, double, fertilization, which, involves, the, fusion, of, two, male, gametes, with, the, egg, cell, and, the, central, cell, to, form, the, primary, endosperm, and, the, zygote, right, after, fertilization, the, zygote, is, mostly, inactive, but, the, primary, endosperm, divides, rapidly, to, form, the, endosperm, tissue, this, tissue, becomes, the, food, the, young, plant, will, consume, until, the, roots, have, developed, after, germination, after, fertilization, the, ovules, develop, into, the, seeds, the, ovule, consists, of, a, number, of, components, the, shape, of, the, ovules, as, they, develop, often, affects, the, final, shape, of, the, seeds, plants, generally, produce, ovules, of, four, shapes, the, most, common, shape, is, called, anatropous, with, a, curved, shape, orthotropous, ovules, are, straight, with, all, the, parts, of, the, ovule, lined, up, in, a, long, row, producing, an, uncurved, seed, campylotropous, ovules, have, a, curved, megagametophyte, often, giving, the, seed, a, tight, c, shape, the, last, ovule, shape, is, called, amphitropous, where, the, ovule, is, partly, inverted, and, turned, back, 90, degrees, on, its, stalk, the, funicle, or, funiculus, in, the, majority, of, flowering, plants, the, zygote, s, first, division, is, transversely, oriented, in, regards, to, the, long, axis, and, this, establishes, the, polarity, of, the, embryo, the, upper, or, chalazal, pole, becomes, the, main, area, of, growth, of, the, embryo, while, the, lower, or, micropylar, pole, produces, the, stalk, like, suspensor, that, attaches, to, the, micropyle, the, suspensor, absorbs, and, manufactures, nutrients, from, the, endosperm, that, are, used, during, the, embryo, s, growth, the, main, components, of, the, embryo, are, monocotyledonous, plants, have, two, additional, structures, in, the, form, of, sheaths, the, plumule, is, covered, with, a, coleoptile, that, forms, the, first, leaf, while, the, radicle, is, covered, with, a, coleorhiza, that, connects, to, the, primary, root, and, adventitious, roots, form, the, sides, here, the, hypocotyl, is, a, rudimentary, axis, between, radicle, and, plumule, the, seeds, of, corn, are, constructed, with, these, structures, pericarp, scutellum, single, large, cotyledon, that, absorbs, nutrients, from, the, endosperm, plumule, radicle, coleoptile, and, coleorhiza, these, last, two, structures, are, sheath, like, and, enclose, the, plumule, and, radicle, acting, as, a, protective, covering, the, maturing, ovule, undergoes, marked, changes, in, the, integuments, generally, a, reduction, and, disorganization, but, occasionally, a, thickening, the, seed, coat, forms, from, the, two, integuments, or, outer, layers, of, cells, of, the, ovule, which, derive, from, tissue, from, the, mother, plant, the, inner, integument, forms, the, tegmen, and, the, outer, forms, the, testa, the, seed, coats, of, some, monocotyledon, plants, such, as, the, grasses, are, not, distinct, structures, but, are, fused, with, the, fruit, wall, to, form, a, pericarp, the, testae, of, both, monocots, and, dicots, are, often, marked, with, patterns, and, textured, markings, or, have, wings, or, tufts, of, hair, when, the, seed, coat, forms, from, only, one, layer, it, is, also, called, the, testa, though, not, all, such, testae, are, homologous, from, one, species, to, the, next, the, funiculus, abscisses, detaches, at, fixed, point, abscission, zone, the, scar, forming, an, oval, depression, the, hilum, anatropous, ovules, have, a, portion, of, the, funiculus, that, is, adnate, fused, to, the, seed, coat, and, which, forms, a, longitudinal, ridge, or, raphe, just, above, the, hilum, in, bitegmic, ovules, e, g, gossypium, described, here, both, inner, and, outer, integuments, contribute, to, the, seed, coat, formation, with, continuing, maturation, the, cells, enlarge, in, the, outer, integument, while, the, inner, epidermis, may, remain, a, single, layer, it, may, also, divide, to, produce, two, to, three, layers, and, accumulates, starch, and, is, referred, to, as, the, colourless, layer, by, contrast, the, outer, epidermis, becomes, tanniferous, the, inner, integument, may, consist, of, eight, to, fifteen, layers, as, the, cells, enlarge, and, starch, is, deposited, in, the, outer, layers, of, the, pigmented, zone, below, the, outer, epidermis, this, zone, begins, to, lignify, while, the, cells, of, the, outer, epidermis, enlarge, radially, and, their, walls, thicken, with, nucleus, and, cytoplasm, compressed, into, the, outer, layer, these, cells, which, are, broader, on, their, inner, surface, are, called, palisade, cells, in, the, inner, epidermis, the, cells, also, enlarge, radially, with, plate, like, thickening, of, the, walls, the, mature, inner, integument, has, a, palisade, layer, a, pigmented, zone, with, 15, 20, layers, while, the, innermost, layer, is, known, as, the, fringe, layer, in, gymnosperms, which, do, not, form, ovaries, the, ovules, and, hence, the, seeds, are, exposed, this, is, the, basis, for, their, nomenclature, naked, seeded, plants, two, sperm, cells, transferred, from, the, pollen, do, not, develop, the, seed, by, double, fertilization, but, one, sperm, nucleus, unites, with, the, egg, nucleus, and, the, other, sperm, is, not, used, sometimes, each, sperm, fertilizes, an, egg, cell, and, one, zygote, is, then, aborted, or, absorbed, during, early, development, the, seed, is, composed, of, the, embryo, the, result, of, fertilization, and, tissue, from, the, mother, plant, which, also, form, a, cone, around, the, seed, in, coniferous, plants, such, as, pine, and, spruce, seeds, are, very, diverse, and, as, such, there, are, many, terms, are, used, to, describe, them, a, typical, seed, includes, two, basic, parts, in, addition, the, endosperm, forms, a, supply, of, nutrients, for, the, embryo, in, most, monocotyledons, and, the, endospermic, dicotyledons, seeds, have, been, considered, to, occur, in, many, structurally, different, types, martin, 1946, these, are, based, on, a, number, of, criteria, of, which, the, dominant, one, is, the, embryo, to, seed, size, ratio, this, reflects, the, degree, to, which, the, developing, cotyledons, absorb, the, nutrients, of, the, endosperm, and, thus, obliterate, it, six, types, occur, amongst, the, monocotyledons, ten, in, the, dicotyledons, and, two, in, the, gymnosperms, linear, and, spatulate, this, classification, is, based, on, three, characteristics, embryo, morphology, amount, of, endosperm, and, the, position, of, the, embryo, relative, to, the, endosperm, in, endospermic, seeds, there, are, two, distinct, regions, inside, the, seed, coat, an, upper, and, larger, endosperm, and, a, lower, smaller, embryo, the, embryo, is, the, fertilised, ovule, an, immature, plant, from, which, a, new, plant, will, grow, under, proper, conditions, the, embryo, has, one, cotyledon, or, seed, leaf, in, monocotyledons, two, cotyledons, in, almost, all, dicotyledons, and, two, or, more, in, gymnosperms, in, the, fruit, of, grains, caryopses, the, single, monocotyledon, is, shield, shaped, and, hence, called, a, scutellum, the, scutellum, is, pressed, closely, against, the, endosperm, from, which, it, absorbs, food, and, passes, it, to, the, growing, parts, embryo, descriptors, include, small, straight, bent, curved, and, curled, within, the, seed, there, usually, is, a, store, of, nutrients, for, the, seedling, that, will, grow, from, the, embryo, the, form, of, the, stored, nutrition, varies, depending, on, the, kind, of, plant, in, angiosperms, the, stored, food, begins, as, a, tissue, called, the, endosperm, which, is, derived, from, the, mother, plant, and, the, pollen, via, double, fertilization, it, is, usually, triploid, and, is, rich, in, oil, or, starch, and, protein, in, gymnosperms, such, as, conifers, the, food, storage, tissue, also, called, endosperm, is, part, of, the, female, gametophyte, a, haploid, tissue, the, endosperm, is, surrounded, by, the, aleurone, layer, peripheral, endosperm, filled, with, proteinaceous, aleurone, grains, originally, by, analogy, with, the, animal, ovum, the, outer, nucellus, layer, perisperm, was, referred, to, as, albumen, and, the, inner, endosperm, layer, as, vitellus, although, misleading, the, term, began, to, be, applied, to, all, the, nutrient, matter, this, terminology, persists, in, referring, to, endospermic, seeds, as, albuminous, the, nature, of, this, material, is, used, in, both, describing, and, classifying, seeds, in, addition, to, the, embryo, to, endosperm, size, ratio, the, endosperm, may, be, considered, to, be, farinaceous, or, mealy, in, which, the, cells, are, filled, with, starch, as, for, instance, cereal, grains, or, not, non, farinaceous, the, endosperm, may, also, be, referred, to, as, fleshy, or, cartilaginous, with, thicker, soft, cells, such, as, coconut, but, may, also, be, oily, as, in, ricinus, castor, oil, croton, and, poppy, the, endosperm, is, called, horny, when, the, cell, walls, are, thicker, such, as, date, and, coffee, or, ruminated, if, mottled, as, in, nutmeg, palms, and, annonaceae, in, most, monocotyledons, such, as, grasses, and, palms, and, some, endospermic, or, albuminous, dicotyledons, such, as, castor, beans, the, embryo, is, embedded, in, the, endosperm, and, nucellus, which, the, seedling, will, use, upon, germination, in, the, non, endospermic, dicotyledons, the, endosperm, is, absorbed, by, the, embryo, as, the, latter, grows, within, the, developing, seed, and, the, cotyledons, of, the, embryo, become, filled, with, stored, food, at, maturity, seeds, of, these, species, have, no, endosperm, and, are, also, referred, to, as, exalbuminous, seeds, the, exalbuminous, seeds, include, the, legumes, such, as, beans, and, peas, trees, such, as, the, oak, and, walnut, vegetables, such, as, squash, and, radish, and, sunflowers, according, to, bewley, and, black, 1978, brazil, nut, storage, is, in, hypocotyl, and, this, place, of, storage, is, uncommon, among, seeds, all, gymnosperm, seeds, are, albuminous, the, seed, coat, develops, from, the, maternal, tissue, the, integuments, originally, surrounding, the, ovule, the, seed, coat, in, the, mature, seed, can, be, a, paper, thin, layer, e, g, peanut, or, something, more, substantial, e, g, thick, and, hard, in, honey, locust, and, coconut, or, fleshy, as, in, the, sarcotesta, of, pomegranate, the, seed, coat, helps, protect, the, embryo, from, mechanical, injury, predators, and, drying, out, depending, on, its, development, the, seed, coat, is, either, bitegmic, or, unitegmic, bitegmic, seeds, form, a, testa, from, the, outer, integument, and, a, tegmen, from, the, inner, integument, while, unitegmic, seeds, have, only, one, integument, usually, parts, of, the, testa, or, tegmen, form, a, hard, protective, mechanical, layer, the, mechanical, layer, may, prevent, water, penetration, and, germination, amongst, the, barriers, may, be, the, presence, of, lignified, sclereids, the, outer, integument, has, a, number, of, layers, generally, between, four, and, eight, organised, into, three, layers, a, outer, epidermis, b, outer, pigmented, zone, of, two, to, five, layers, containing, tannin, and, starch, and, c, inner, epidermis, the, endotegmen, is, derived, from, the, inner, epidermis, of, the, inner, integument, the, exotegmen, from, the, outer, surface, of, the, inner, integument, the, endotesta, is, derived, from, the, inner, epidermis, of, the, outer, integument, and, the, outer, layer, of, the, testa, from, the, outer, surface, of, the, outer, integument, is, referred, to, as, the, exotesta, if, the, exotesta, is, also, the, mechanical, layer, this, is, called, an, exotestal, seed, but, if, the, mechanical, layer, is, the, endotegmen, then, the, seed, is, endotestal, the, exotesta, may, consist, of, one, or, more, rows, of, cells, that, are, elongated, and, pallisade, like, e, g, fabaceae, hence, palisade, exotesta, in, addition, to, the, three, basic, seed, parts, some, seeds, have, an, appendage, an, aril, a, fleshy, outgrowth, of, the, funicle, funiculus, as, in, yew, and, nutmeg, or, an, oily, appendage, an, elaiosome, as, in, corydalis, or, hairs, trichomes, in, the, latter, example, these, hairs, are, the, source, of, the, textile, crop, cotton, other, seed, appendages, include, the, raphe, a, ridge, wings, caruncles, a, soft, spongy, outgrowth, from, the, outer, integument, in, the, vicinity, of, the, micropyle, spines, or, tubercles, a, scar, also, may, remain, on, the, seed, coat, called, the, hilum, where, the, seed, was, attached, to, the, ovary, wall, by, the, funicle, just, below, it, is, a, small, pore, representing, the, micropyle, of, the, ovule, seeds, are, very, diverse, in, size, the, dust, like, orchid, seeds, are, the, smallest, with, about, one, million, seeds, per, gram, they, are, often, embryonic, seeds, with, immature, embryos, and, no, significant, energy, reserves, orchids, and, a, few, other, groups, of, plants, are, mycoheterotrophs, which, depend, on, mycorrhizal, fungi, for, nutrition, during, germination, and, the, early, growth, of, the, seedling, some, terrestrial, orchid, seedlings, in, fact, spend, the, first, few, years, of, their, lives, deriving, energy, from, the, fungi, and, do, not, produce, green, leaves, at, up, to, 55, pounds, 25, kilograms, the, largest, seed, is, the, coco, de, mer, lodoicea, maldivica, this, indicates, a, 25, billion, fold, difference, in, seed, weight, plants, that, produce, smaller, seeds, can, generate, many, more, seeds, per, flower, while, plants, with, larger, seeds, invest, more, resources, into, those, seeds, and, normally, produce, fewer, seeds, small, seeds, are, quicker, to, ripen, and, can, be, dispersed, sooner, so, autumn, all, blooming, plants, often, have, small, seeds, many, annual, plants, produce, great, quantities, of, smaller, seeds, this, helps, to, ensure, at, least, a, few, will, end, in, a, favorable, place, for, growth, herbaceous, perennials, and, woody, plants, often, have, larger, seeds, they, can, produce, seeds, over, many, years, and, larger, seeds, have, more, energy, reserves, for, germination, and, seedling, growth, and, produce, larger, more, established, seedlings, after, germination, seeds, serve, several, functions, for, the, plants, that, produce, them, key, among, these, functions, are, nourishment, of, the, embryo, dispersal, to, a, new, location, and, dormancy, during, unfavorable, conditions, seeds, fundamentally, are, means, of, reproduction, and, most, seeds, are, the, product, of, sexual, reproduction, which, produces, a, remixing, of, genetic, material, and, phenotype, variability, on, which, natural, selection, acts, plant, seeds, hold, endophytic, microorganisms, that, can, perform, various, functions, the, most, important, of, which, is, protection, against, disease, seeds, protect, and, nourish, the, embryo, or, young, plant, they, usually, give, a, seedling, a, faster, start, than, a, sporeling, from, a, spore, because, of, the, larger, food, reserves, in, the, seed, and, the, multicellularity, of, the, enclosed, embryo, unlike, animals, plants, are, limited, in, their, ability, to, seek, out, favorable, conditions, for, life, and, growth, as, a, result, plants, have, evolved, many, ways, to, disperse, their, offspring, by, dispersing, their, seeds, see, also, vegetative, reproduction, a, seed, must, somehow, arrive, at, a, location, and, be, there, at, a, time, favorable, for, germination, and, growth, when, the, fruits, open, and, release, their, seeds, in, a, regular, way, it, is, called, dehiscent, which, is, often, distinctive, for, related, groups, of, plants, these, fruits, include, capsules, follicles, legumes, silicles, and, siliques, when, fruits, do, not, open, and, release, their, seeds, in, a, regular, fashion, they, are, called, indehiscent, which, include, the, fruits, achenes, caryopses, nuts, samaras, and, utricles, other, seeds, are, enclosed, in, fruit, structures, that, aid, wind, dispersal, in, similar, ways, myrmecochory, is, the, dispersal, of, seeds, by, ants, foraging, ants, disperse, seeds, which, have, appendages, called, elaiosomes, e, g, bloodroot, trilliums, acacias, and, many, species, of, proteaceae, elaiosomes, are, soft, fleshy, structures, that, contain, nutrients, for, animals, that, eat, them, the, ants, carry, such, seeds, back, to, their, nest, where, the, elaiosomes, are, eaten, the, remainder, of, the, seed, which, is, hard, and, inedible, to, the, ants, then, germinates, either, within, the, nest, or, at, a, removal, site, where, the, seed, has, been, discarded, by, the, ants, this, dispersal, relationship, is, an, example, of, mutualism, since, the, plants, depend, upon, the, ants, to, disperse, seeds, while, the, ants, depend, upon, the, plants, seeds, for, food, as, a, result, a, drop, in, numbers, of, one, partner, can, reduce, success, of, the, other, in, south, africa, the, argentine, ant, linepithema, humile, has, invaded, and, displaced, native, species, of, ants, unlike, the, native, ant, species, argentine, ants, do, not, collect, the, seeds, of, mimetes, cucullatus, or, eat, the, elaiosomes, in, areas, where, these, ants, have, invaded, the, numbers, of, mimetes, seedlings, have, dropped, seed, dormancy, has, two, main, functions, the, first, is, synchronizing, germination, with, the, optimal, conditions, for, survival, of, the, resulting, seedling, the, second, is, spreading, germination, of, a, batch, of, seeds, over, time, so, a, catastrophe, e, g, late, frosts, drought, herbivory, does, not, result, in, the, death, of, all, offspring, of, a, plant, bet, hedging, seed, dormancy, is, defined, as, a, seed, failing, to, germinate, under, environmental, conditions, optimal, for, germination, normally, when, the, environment, is, at, a, suitable, temperature, with, proper, soil, moisture, this, true, dormancy, or, innate, dormancy, is, therefore, caused, by, conditions, within, the, seed, that, prevent, germination, thus, dormancy, is, a, state, of, the, seed, not, of, the, environment, induced, dormancy, enforced, dormancy, or, seed, quiescence, occurs, when, a, seed, fails, to, germinate, because, the, external, environmental, conditions, are, inappropriate, for, germination, mostly, in, response, to, conditions, being, too, dark, or, light, too, cold, or, hot, or, too, dry, seed, dormancy, is, not, the, same, as, seed, persistence, in, the, soil, or, on, the, plant, though, even, in, scientific, publications, dormancy, and, persistence, are, often, confused, or, used, as, synonyms, often, seed, dormancy, is, divided, into, four, major, categories, exogenous, endogenous, combinational, and, secondary, a, more, recent, system, distinguishes, five, classes, morphological, physiological, morphophysiological, physical, and, combinational, dormancy, exogenous, dormancy, is, caused, by, conditions, outside, the, embryo, including, endogenous, dormancy, is, caused, by, conditions, within, the, embryo, itself, including, the, following, types, of, seed, dormancy, do, not, involve, seed, dormancy, strictly, speaking, as, lack, of, germination, is, prevented, by, the, environment, not, by, characteristics, of, the, seed, itself, see, germination, not, all, seeds, undergo, a, period, of, dormancy, seeds, of, some, mangroves, are, viviparous, they, begin, to, germinate, while, still, attached, to, the, parent, the, large, heavy, root, allows, the, seed, to, penetrate, into, the, ground, when, it, falls, many, garden, plant, seeds, will, germinate, readily, as, soon, as, they, have, water, and, are, warm, enough, though, their, wild, ancestors, may, have, had, dormancy, these, cultivated, plants, lack, it, after, many, generations, of, selective, pressure, by, plant, breeders, and, gardeners, dormancy, has, been, selected, out, for, annuals, seeds, are, a, way, for, the, species, to, survive, dry, or, cold, seasons, ephemeral, plants, are, usually, annuals, that, can, go, from, seed, to, seed, in, as, few, as, six, weeks, seed, germination, is, a, process, by, which, a, seed, embryo, develops, into, a, seedling, it, involves, the, reactivation, of, the, metabolic, pathways, that, lead, to, growth, and, the, emergence, of, the, radicle, or, seed, root, and, plumule, or, shoot, the, emergence, of, the, seedling, above, the, soil, surface, is, the, next, phase, of, the, plant, s, growth, and, is, called, seedling, establishment, three, fundamental, conditions, must, exist, before, germination, can, occur, 1, the, embryo, must, be, alive, called, seed, viability, 2, any, dormancy, requirements, that, prevent, germination, must, be, overcome, 3, the, proper, environmental, conditions, must, exist, for, germination, far, red, light, can, prevent, germination, seed, viability, is, the, ability, of, the, embryo, to, germinate, and, is, affected, by, a, number, of, different, conditions, some, plants, do, not, produce, seeds, that, have, functional, complete, embryos, or, the, seed, may, have, no, embryo, at, all, often, called, empty, seeds, predators, and, pathogens, can, damage, or, kill, the, seed, while, it, is, still, in, the, fruit, or, after, it, is, dispersed, environmental, conditions, like, flooding, or, heat, can, kill, the, seed, before, or, during, germination, the, age, of, the, seed, affects, its, health, and, germination, ability, since, the, seed, has, a, living, embryo, over, time, cells, die, and, cannot, be, replaced, some, seeds, can, live, for, a, long, time, before, germination, while, others, can, only, survive, for, a, short, period, after, dispersal, before, they, die, seed, vigor, is, a, measure, of, the, quality, of, seed, and, involves, the, viability, of, the, seed, the, germination, percentage, germination, rate, and, the, strength, of, the, seedlings, produced, the, germination, percentage, is, simply, the, proportion, of, seeds, that, germinate, from, all, seeds, subject, to, the, right, conditions, for, growth, the, germination, rate, is, the, length, of, time, it, takes, for, the, seeds, to, germinate, germination, percentages, and, rates, are, affected, by, seed, viability, dormancy, and, environmental, effects, that, impact, on, the, seed, and, seedling, in, agriculture, and, horticulture, quality, seeds, have, high, viability, measured, by, germination, percentage, plus, the, rate, of, germination, this, is, given, as, a, percent, of, germination, over, a, certain, amount, of, time, 90, germination, in, 20, days, for, example, dormancy, is, covered, above, many, plants, produce, seeds, with, varying, degrees, of, dormancy, and, different, seeds, from, the, same, fruit, can, have, different, degrees, of, dormancy, it, s, possible, to, have, seeds, with, no, dormancy, if, they, are, dispersed, right, away, and, do, not, dry, if, the, seeds, dry, they, go, into, physiological, dormancy, there, is, great, variation, amongst, plants, and, a, dormant, seed, is, still, a, viable, seed, even, though, the, germination, rate, might, be, very, low, environmental, conditions, affecting, seed, germination, include, water, oxygen, temperature, and, light, three, distinct, phases, of, seed, germination, occur, water, imbibition, lag, phase, and, radicle, emergence, in, order, for, the, seed, coat, to, split, the, embryo, must, imbibe, soak, up, water, which, causes, it, to, swell, splitting, the, seed, coat, however, the, nature, of, the, seed, coat, determines, how, rapidly, water, can, penetrate, and, subsequently, initiate, germination, the, rate, of, imbibition, is, dependent, on, the, permeability, of, the, seed, coat, amount, of, water, in, the, environment, and, the, area, of, contact, the, seed, has, to, the, source, of, water, for, some, seeds, imbibing, too, much, water, too, quickly, can, kill, the, seed, for, some, seeds, once, water, is, imbibed, the, germination, process, cannot, be, stopped, and, drying, then, becomes, fatal, other, seeds, can, imbibe, and, lose, water, a, few, times, without, causing, ill, effects, but, drying, can, cause, secondary, dormancy, during, seed, dormancy, often, associated, with, unpredictable, and, stressful, environments, dna, damage, accumulates, as, the, seeds, age, in, rye, seeds, the, reduction, of, dna, integrity, due, to, damage, is, associated, with, loss, of, seed, viability, during, storage, upon, germination, seeds, of, vicia, faba, undergo, dna, repair, a, plant, dna, ligase, that, is, involved, in, repair, of, single, and, double, strand, breaks, during, seed, germination, is, an, important, determinant, of, seed, longevity, also, in, arabidopsis, seeds, the, activities, of, the, dna, repair, enzymes, poly, adp, ribose, polymerases, parp, are, likely, needed, for, successful, germination, thus, dna, damages, that, accumulate, during, dormancy, appear, to, be, a, problem, for, seed, survival, and, the, enzymatic, repair, of, dna, damages, during, germination, appears, to, be, important, for, seed, viability, a, number, of, different, strategies, are, used, by, gardeners, and, horticulturists, to, break, seed, dormancy, scarification, allows, water, and, gases, to, penetrate, into, the, seed, it, includes, methods, to, physically, break, the, hard, seed, coats, or, soften, them, by, chemicals, such, as, soaking, in, hot, water, or, poking, holes, in, the, seed, with, a, pin, or, rubbing, them, on, sandpaper, or, cracking, with, a, press, or, hammer, sometimes, fruits, are, harvested, while, the, seeds, are, still, immature, and, the, seed, coat, is, not, fully, developed, and, sown, right, away, before, the, seed, coat, become, impermeable, under, natural, conditions, seed, coats, are, worn, down, by, rodents, chewing, on, the, seed, the, seeds, rubbing, against, rocks, seeds, are, moved, by, the, wind, or, water, currents, by, undergoing, freezing, and, thawing, of, surface, water, or, passing, through, an, animal, s, digestive, tract, in, the, latter, case, the, seed, coat, protects, the, seed, from, digestion, while, often, weakening, the, seed, coat, such, that, the, embryo, is, ready, to, sprout, when, it, is, deposited, along, with, a, bit, of, fecal, matter, that, acts, as, fertilizer, far, from, the, parent, plant, microorganisms, are, often, effective, in, breaking, down, hard, seed, coats, and, are, sometimes, used, by, people, as, a, treatment, the, seeds, are, stored, in, a, moist, warm, sandy, medium, for, several, months, under, nonsterile, conditions, stratification, also, called, moist, chilling, breaks, down, physiological, dormancy, and, involves, the, addition, of, moisture, to, the, seeds, so, they, absorb, water, and, they, are, then, subjected, to, a, period, of, moist, chilling, to, after, ripen, the, embryo, sowing, in, late, summer, and, fall, and, allowing, to, overwinter, under, cool, conditions, is, an, effective, way, to, stratify, seeds, some, seeds, respond, more, favorably, to, periods, of, oscillating, temperatures, which, are, a, part, of, the, natural, environment, leaching, or, the, soaking, in, water, removes, chemical, inhibitors, in, some, seeds, that, prevent, germination, rain, and, melting, snow, naturally, accomplish, this, task, for, seeds, planted, in, gardens, running, water, is, best, if, soaked, in, a, container, 12, to, 24, hours, of, soaking, is, sufficient, soaking, longer, especially, in, stagnant, water, can, result, in, oxygen, starvation, and, seed, death, seeds, with, hard, seed, coats, can, be, soaked, in, hot, water, to, break, open, the, impermeable, cell, layers, that, prevent, water, intake, other, methods, used, to, assist, in, the, germination, of, seeds, that, have, dormancy, include, prechilling, predrying, daily, alternation, of, temperature, light, exposure, potassium, nitrate, the, use, of, plant, growth, regulators, such, as, gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene, thiourea, sodium, hypochlorite, and, others, some, seeds, germinate, best, after, a, fire, for, some, seeds, fire, cracks, hard, seed, coats, while, in, others, chemical, dormancy, is, broken, in, reaction, to, the, presence, of, smoke, liquid, smoke, is, often, used, by, gardeners, to, assist, in, the, germination, of, these, species, seeds, may, be, sterile, for, few, reasons, they, may, have, been, irradiated, unpollinated, cells, lived, past, expectancy, or, bred, for, the, purpose, the, issue, of, the, origin, of, seed, plants, remains, unsolved, however, more, and, more, data, tends, to, place, this, origin, in, the, middle, devonian, the, description, in, 2004, of, the, proto, seed, runcaria, heinzelinii, in, the, givetian, of, belgium, is, an, indication, of, that, ancient, origin, of, seed, plants, as, with, modern, ferns, most, land, plants, before, this, time, reproduced, by, sending, into, the, air, spores, that, would, land, and, become, whole, new, plants, taxonomists, have, described, early, true, seeds, from, the, upper, devonian, which, probably, became, the, theater, of, their, true, first, evolutionary, radiation, with, this, radiation, came, an, evolution, of, seed, size, shape, dispersal, and, eventually, the, radiation, of, gymnosperms, and, angiosperms, and, monocotyledons, and, dicotyledons, seed, plants, progressively, became, one, of, the, major, elements, of, nearly, all, ecosystems, also, called, growing, true, refers, to, plants, whose, seed, will, yield, the, same, type, of, plant, as, the, original, plant, open, pollinated, plants, which, include, heirlooms, will, almost, always, grow, true, to, seed, if, another, variety, does, not, cross, pollinate, them, seeds, harbor, a, diverse, microbial, community, most, of, these, microorganisms, are, transmitted, from, the, seed, to, the, developing, seedlings, in, the, united, states, farmers, spent, 22, billion, on, seeds, in, 2018, a, 35, percent, increase, since, 2010, dowdupont, and, monsanto, account, for, 72, percent, of, corn, and, soybean, seed, sales, in, the, u, s, with, the, average, price, of, a, bag, of, gmo, corn, seed, is, priced, at, 270, seed, production, in, natural, plant, populations, varies, widely, from, year, to, year, in, response, to, weather, variables, insects, and, diseases, and, internal, cycles, within, the, plants, themselves, over, a, 20, year, period, for, example, forests, composed, of, loblolly, pine, and, shortleaf, pine, produced, from, 0, to, nearly, 5, 5, million, sound, pine, seeds, per, hectare, over, this, period, there, were, six, bumper, five, poor, and, nine, good, seed, crops, when, evaluated, for, production, of, adequate, seedlings, for, natural, forest, reproduction, many, seeds, are, edible, and, the, majority, of, human, calories, comes, from, seeds, especially, from, cereals, legumes, and, nuts, seeds, also, provide, most, cooking, oils, many, beverages, and, spices, and, some, important, food, additives, in, different, seeds, the, seed, embryo, or, the, endosperm, dominates, and, provides, most, of, the, nutrients, the, storage, proteins, of, the, embryo, and, endosperm, differ, in, their, amino, acid, content, and, physical, properties, for, example, the, gluten, of, wheat, important, in, providing, the, elastic, property, to, bread, dough, is, strictly, an, endosperm, protein, seeds, are, used, to, propagate, many, crops, such, as, cereals, legumes, forest, trees, turfgrasses, and, pasture, grasses, particularly, in, developing, countries, a, major, constraint, faced, is, the, inadequacy, of, the, marketing, channels, to, get, the, seed, to, poor, farmers, thus, the, use, of, farmer, retained, seed, remains, quite, common, seeds, are, also, eaten, by, animals, seed, predation, and, are, also, fed, to, livestock, or, provided, as, birdseed, while, some, seeds, are, edible, others, are, harmful, poisonous, or, deadly, plants, and, seeds, often, contain, chemical, compounds, to, discourage, herbivores, and, seed, predators, in, some, cases, these, compounds, simply, taste, bad, such, as, in, mustard, but, other, compounds, are, toxic, or, break, down, into, toxic, compounds, within, the, digestive, system, children, being, smaller, than, adults, are, more, susceptible, to, poisoning, by, plants, and, seeds, a, deadly, poison, ricin, comes, from, seeds, of, the, castor, bean, reported, lethal, doses, are, anywhere, from, two, to, eight, seeds, though, only, a, few, deaths, have, been, reported, when, castor, beans, have, been, ingested, by, animals, in, addition, seeds, containing, amygdalin, apple, apricot, bitter, almond, peach, plum, cherry, quince, and, others, when, consumed, in, sufficient, amounts, may, cause, cyanide, poisoning, other, seeds, that, contain, poisons, include, annona, cotton, custard, apple, datura, uncooked, durian, golden, chain, horse, chestnut, larkspur, locoweed, lychee, nectarine, rambutan, rosary, pea, sour, sop, sugar, apple, wisteria, and, yew, the, seeds, of, the, strychnine, tree, are, also, poisonous, containing, the, poison, strychnine, the, seeds, of, many, legumes, including, the, common, bean, phaseolus, vulgaris, contain, proteins, called, lectins, which, can, cause, gastric, distress, if, the, beans, are, eaten, without, cooking, the, common, bean, and, many, others, including, the, soybean, also, contain, trypsin, inhibitors, which, interfere, with, the, action, of, the, digestive, enzyme, trypsin, normal, cooking, processes, degrade, lectins, and, trypsin, inhibitors, to, harmless, forms, cotton, fiber, grows, attached, to, cotton, plant, seeds, other, seed, fibers, are, from, kapok, and, milkweed, many, important, nonfood, oils, are, extracted, from, seeds, linseed, oil, is, used, in, paints, oil, from, jojoba, and, crambe, are, similar, to, whale, oil, seeds, are, the, source, of, some, medicines, including, castor, oil, tea, tree, oil, and, the, quack, cancer, drug, laetrile, many, seeds, have, been, used, as, beads, in, necklaces, and, rosaries, including, job, s, tears, chinaberry, rosary, pea, and, castor, bean, however, the, latter, three, are, also, poisonous, other, seed, uses, include, the, book, of, genesis, in, the, old, testament, begins, with, an, explanation, of, how, all, plant, forms, began, and, god, said, let, the, earth, bring, forth, grass, the, herb, yielding, seed, and, the, fruit, tree, yielding, fruit, after, his, kind, whose, seed, is, in, itself, upon, the, earth, and, it, was, so, and, the, earth, brought, forth, grass, and, herb, yielding, seed, after, its, kind, and, the, tree, yielding, fruit, whose, seed, was, in, itself, after, its, kind, and, god, saw, that, it, was, good, and, the, evening, and, the, morning, were, the, third, day, the, quran, speaks, of, seed, germination, thus, it, is, allah, who, causeth, the, seed, grain, and, the, date, stone, to, split, and, sprout, he, causeth, the, living, to, issue, from, the, dead, and, he, is, the, one, to, cause, the, dead, to, issue, from, the, living, that, is, allah, then, how, are, ye, deluded, away, from, the, truth
