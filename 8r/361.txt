tarantulas, comprise, a, group, of, large, and, often, hairy, spiders, of, the, family, theraphosidae, as, of, december, 2023, 1, 100, species, have, been, identified, with, 166, genera, the, term, tarantula, is, usually, used, to, describe, members, of, the, family, theraphosidae, although, many, other, members, of, the, same, infraorder, mygalomorphae, are, commonly, referred, to, as, tarantulas, or, false, tarantulas, some, of, the, more, common, species, have, become, popular, in, the, exotic, pet, trade, many, new, world, species, kept, as, pets, have, setae, known, as, urticating, hairs, that, can, cause, irritation, to, the, skin, and, in, extreme, cases, cause, damage, to, the, eyes, like, all, arthropods, the, tarantula, is, an, invertebrate, that, relies, on, an, exoskeleton, for, muscular, support, like, other, arachnida, a, tarantula, s, body, comprises, two, main, parts, the, prosoma, or, cephalothorax, and, the, opisthosoma, or, abdomen, the, prosoma, and, opisthosoma, are, connected, by, the, pedicel, or, pregenital, somite, this, waist, like, connecting, piece, is, actually, part, of, the, prosoma, and, gives, the, opisthosoma, a, wide, range, of, motion, relative, to, the, prosoma, depending, on, the, species, the, body, length, of, tarantulas, ranges, from, about, 5, to, 11, cm, 2, to, 4, 1, 2, in, with, leg, spans, of, 8, 30, cm, 3, 12, in, leg, span, is, determined, by, measuring, from, the, tip, of, the, back, leg, to, the, tip, of, the, front, leg, on, the, opposite, side, some, of, the, largest, species, of, tarantula, may, weigh, over, 85, g, 3, oz, the, largest, of, all, the, goliath, birdeater, theraphosa, blondi, from, venezuela, and, brazil, has, been, reported, to, attain, a, weight, of, 170, g, 6, oz, and, a, leg, span, up, to, 30, cm, 12, in, males, being, longer, and, females, greater, in, girth, the, fang, size, of, this, tarantula, reaches, a, maximum, of, 4, cm, 1, 1, 2, in, theraphosa, apophysis, the, pinkfoot, goliath, was, described, 187, years, after, the, goliath, birdeater, so, its, characteristics, are, not, as, well, attested, t, blondi, is, generally, thought, to, be, the, heaviest, tarantula, and, t, apophysis, has, the, greatest, leg, span, two, other, species, lasiodora, parahybana, the, brazilian, salmon, birdeater, and, lasiodora, klugi, rival, the, size, of, the, two, goliath, spiders, most, species, of, north, american, tarantulas, are, brown, elsewhere, species, have, been, found, that, variously, display, cobalt, blue, cyriopagopus, lividus, black, with, white, stripes, aphonopelma, seemanni, yellow, leg, markings, eupalaestrus, campestratus, metallic, blue, legs, with, vibrant, orange, abdomen, and, green, prosoma, chromatopelma, cyaneopubescens, their, natural, habitats, include, savanna, grassland, such, as, in, the, pampas, rainforest, desert, scrubland, mountains, and, cloud, forest, they, are, generally, classed, among, the, terrestrial, types, they, are, burrowers, that, live, in, the, ground, tarantulas, are, becoming, increasingly, popular, as, pets, and, some, species, are, readily, available, in, captivity, tarantulas, can, be, confused, with, other, members, of, the, order, mygalomorphae, such, as, trapdoor, spiders, funnel, web, spiders, and, purseweb, spiders, they, can, also, be, confused, with, some, members, of, the, order, araneomorphae, such, as, the, lycosidae, family, there, are, multiple, ways, to, identify, a, tarantula, first, the, hairs, in, the, americas, most, tarantulas, have, urticating, hairs, though, some, such, as, the, hemirrhagus, genus, lack, these, the, hairs, are, usually, more, noticeable, than, with, most, other, spiders, another, is, the, size, as, tarantulas, tend, to, be, bigger, but, this, is, again, not, a, failproof, way, they, also, do, not, use, their, webs, for, hunting, instead, using, them, as, building, material, or, tripwire, one, of, the, most, decisive, ways, to, tell, is, by, looking, at, their, fangs, tarantula, fangs, face, downwards, as, opposed, to, those, of, true, spiders, which, face, each, other, allowing, them, to, make, pincerlike, motions, they, also, own, two, book, lungs, as, opposed, to, true, spiders, which, only, have, one, their, lifespan, is, also, longer, than, most, spiders, the, spider, originally, bearing, the, name, tarantula, was, lycosa, tarantula, a, species, of, wolf, spider, native, to, mediterranean, europe, the, name, is, derived, from, the, southern, italian, town, of, taranto, the, term, tarantula, was, subsequently, applied, to, almost, any, large, unfamiliar, species, of, ground, dwelling, spider, in, particular, to, the, mygalomorphae, and, especially, the, new, world, theraphosidae, compared, to, tarantulas, wolf, spiders, are, not, particularly, large, or, hairy, and, so, among, english, speakers, in, particular, usage, eventually, shifted, in, favour, of, the, theraphosidae, even, though, they, are, not, closely, related, to, wolf, spiders, at, all, being, in, a, different, infraorder, the, name, tarantula, is, also, incorrectly, applied, to, other, large, bodied, spiders, including, the, purseweb, spiders, or, atypical, tarantulas, the, funnel, webs, dipluridae, and, hexathelidae, and, the, dwarf, tarantulas, these, spiders, are, related, to, tarantulas, all, being, mygalomorphs, but, fall, into, different, families, from, them, huntsman, spiders, of, the, family, sparassidae, have, also, been, termed, tarantulas, because, of, their, large, size, when, in, fact, they, are, not, related, instead, huntsman, spiders, belong, to, the, infraorder, araneomorphae, many, theraphosid, genera, have, names, either, accepted, or, synonymous, containing, the, element, pelma, this, can, be, traced, back, to, carl, ludwig, koch, in, 1850, who, in, describing, his, new, genus, eurypelma, wrote, die, sammetb, rste, der, fussohlen, sehr, breit, lit, the, velvet, brush, of, the, footsole, very, wide, german, arachnologists, use, the, word, fu, to, refer, to, the, tarsus, the, last, article, of, a, spider, s, leg, translations, of, sammetb, rste, into, latin, use, the, word, scopula, hence, in, english, arachnological, terminology, koch, meant, the, scopula, of, the, base, of, the, tarsus, very, wide, eury, is, derived, from, the, greek, eur, s, meaning, wide, while, p, lma, means, the, sole, of, the, foot, paralleling, koch, s, use, of, fu, sohle, in, modern, spelling, thus, eurypelma, literally, means, wide, footsole, however, arachnologists, have, conventionally, taken, pelma, in, such, names, to, refer, to, the, scopula, so, producing, the, meaning, with, a, wide, scopula, other, genus, names, or, synonyms, that, estrada, alvarez, and, cameron, regard, as, having, footsole, or, scopula, meanings, include, later, particularly, following, genus, names, published, by, r, i, pocock, in, 1901, the, element, pelma, appears, to, have, become, synonymous, with, theraphosid, for, example, the, author, of, cardiopelma, writes, cardiopelma, fait, r, ference, aux, genitalia, de, la, femelle, qui, voquent, la, forme, d, un, coeur, cardiopelma, refers, to, the, female, genitalia, that, evoke, the, shape, of, a, heart, with, no, reference, to, either, footsole, or, scopula, names, interpreted, in, this, way, include, tarantulas, of, various, species, occur, throughout, the, united, states, mexico, in, central, america, and, throughout, south, america, other, species, occur, variously, throughout, africa, much, of, asia, including, the, ryukyu, islands, in, southern, japan, and, all, of, australia, in, europe, some, species, occur, in, spain, portugal, turkey, southern, italy, and, cyprus, some, genera, of, tarantulas, hunt, prey, primarily, in, trees, others, hunt, on, or, near, the, ground, all, tarantulas, can, produce, silk, while, arboreal, species, typically, reside, in, a, silken, tube, tent, terrestrial, species, line, their, burrows, with, silk, to, stabilize, the, burrow, wall, and, facilitate, climbing, up, and, down, tarantulas, mainly, eat, large, insects, and, other, arthropods, such, as, centipedes, millipedes, and, other, spiders, using, ambush, as, their, primary, method, of, prey, capture, armed, with, their, massive, powerful, chelicerae, tipped, with, long, chitinous, fangs, tarantulas, are, well, adapted, to, killing, other, large, arthropods, the, biggest, tarantulas, sometimes, kill, and, consume, small, vertebrates, such, as, lizards, mice, bats, birds, and, small, snakes, the, eight, legs, the, two, chelicerae, with, their, fangs, and, the, pedipalps, are, attached, to, the, prosoma, the, chelicerae, are, two, double, segmented, appendages, located, just, below, the, eyes, and, directly, forward, of, the, mouth, the, chelicerae, contain, the, venom, glands, that, vent, through, the, fangs, the, fangs, are, hollow, extensions, of, the, chelicerae, that, inject, venom, into, prey, or, animals, that, the, tarantula, bites, in, defense, and, they, are, also, used, to, masticate, these, fangs, are, articulated, so, that, they, can, extend, downward, and, outward, in, preparation, to, bite, or, can, fold, back, toward, the, chelicerae, as, a, pocket, knife, blade, folds, back, into, its, handle, the, chelicerae, of, a, tarantula, completely, contain, the, venom, glands, and, the, muscles, that, surround, them, and, can, cause, the, venom, to, be, forcefully, injected, into, prey, the, pedipalpi, are, two, six, segmented, appendages, connected, to, the, prosoma, near, the, mouth, and, protruding, on, either, side, of, both, chelicerae, in, most, species, of, tarantulas, the, pedipalpi, contain, sharp, jagged, plates, used, to, cut, and, crush, food, often, called, the, coxae, or, maxillae, as, with, other, spiders, the, terminal, portions, of, the, pedipalpi, of, males, function, as, part, of, their, reproductive, system, male, spiders, spin, a, silken, platform, sperm, web, on, the, ground, onto, which, they, release, semen, from, glands, in, their, opisthosoma, then, they, insert, their, pedipalps, into, the, semen, absorb, the, semen, into, the, pedipalps, and, later, insert, the, pedipalps, one, at, a, time, into, the, reproductive, organ, of, the, female, which, is, located, in, her, abdomen, the, terminal, segments, of, the, pedipalps, of, male, tarantulas, are, moderately, larger, in, circumference, than, those, of, a, female, tarantula, male, tarantulas, have, special, spinnerets, surrounding, the, genital, opening, silk, for, the, sperm, web, of, the, tarantula, is, exuded, from, these, special, spinnerets, a, tarantula, has, four, pairs, of, legs, and, two, additional, pairs, of, appendages, each, leg, has, seven, segments, which, from, the, prosoma, out, are, coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, tarsus, and, pretarsus, and, claw, two, or, three, retractable, claws, at, the, end, of, each, leg, are, used, to, grip, surfaces, for, climbing, also, on, the, end, of, each, leg, surrounding, the, claws, is, a, group, of, bristles, called, the, scopula, which, help, the, tarantula, to, grip, better, when, climbing, surfaces, such, as, glass, the, fifth, pair, is, the, pedipalps, which, aid, in, feeling, gripping, prey, and, mating, in, the, case, of, a, mature, male, the, sixth, pair, of, appendages, is, the, chelicerae, and, their, attached, fangs, when, walking, a, tarantula, s, first, and, third, legs, on, one, side, move, at, the, same, time, as, the, second, and, fourth, legs, on, the, other, side, of, its, body, the, muscles, in, a, tarantula, s, legs, cause, the, legs, to, bend, at, the, joints, but, to, extend, a, leg, the, tarantula, increases, the, pressure, of, haemolymph, entering, the, leg, tarantulas, like, almost, all, other, spiders, have, their, primary, spinnerets, at, the, end, of, the, opisthosoma, unlike, most, spider, species, in, the, infraorder, araneomorphae, which, includes, the, majority, of, extant, spider, species, and, most, of, which, have, six, tarantula, species, have, two, or, four, spinnerets, spinnerets, are, flexible, tube, like, structures, from, which, the, spider, exudes, its, silk, the, tip, of, each, spinneret, is, called, the, spinning, field, each, spinning, field, is, covered, by, as, many, as, 100, spinning, tubes, through, which, silk, is, exuded, as, the, silk, is, pulled, out, of, the, spinnerets, the, shear, forces, cause, proteins, in, the, silk, to, crystallize, transforming, it, from, a, liquid, to, a, solid, thread, the, tarantula, s, mouth, is, located, under, its, chelicerae, on, the, lower, front, part, of, its, prosoma, the, mouth, is, a, short, straw, shaped, opening, that, can, only, suck, meaning, that, anything, taken, into, it, must, be, in, liquid, form, prey, with, large, amounts, of, solid, parts, such, as, mice, must, be, crushed, and, ground, up, or, predigested, which, is, accomplished, by, coating, the, prey, with, digestive, juices, secreted, from, openings, in, the, chelicerae, the, tarantula, s, digestive, organ, stomach, is, a, tube, that, runs, the, length, of, its, body, in, the, prosoma, this, tube, is, wider, and, forms, the, sucking, stomach, when, the, sucking, stomach, s, powerful, muscles, contract, the, stomach, is, increased, in, cross, section, creating, a, strong, sucking, action, that, permits, the, tarantula, to, suck, its, liquefied, prey, up, through, the, mouth, and, into, the, intestines, once, the, liquefied, food, enters, the, intestines, it, is, broken, down, into, particles, small, enough, to, pass, through, the, intestine, walls, into, the, hemolymph, blood, stream, where, it, is, distributed, throughout, the, body, after, feeding, the, leftovers, are, formed, into, a, small, ball, by, the, tarantula, and, thrown, away, in, a, terrarium, they, often, put, them, into, the, same, corner, a, tarantula, s, central, nervous, system, brain, is, located, in, the, bottom, of, the, inner, prosoma, a, tarantula, perceives, its, surroundings, primarily, via, sensory, organs, called, setae, bristles, or, spines, sometimes, referred, to, as, hairs, although, a, tarantula, has, eight, eyes, like, most, spiders, touch, is, its, keenest, sense, and, in, hunting, it, primarily, depends, on, vibrations, given, off, by, the, movements, of, its, prey, a, tarantula, s, setae, are, very, sensitive, organs, and, are, used, to, sense, chemical, signatures, vibrations, wind, direction, and, possibly, even, sound, tarantulas, are, also, very, responsive, to, the, presence, of, certain, chemicals, such, as, pheromones, the, eyes, are, located, above, the, chelicerae, on, the, forward, part, of, the, prosoma, they, are, small, and, usually, set, in, two, rows, of, four, most, tarantulas, are, not, able, to, see, much, more, than, light, darkness, and, motion, arboreal, tarantulas, generally, have, better, vision, compared, with, terrestrial, tarantulas, all, types, of, tarantulas, have, two, sets, of, book, lungs, breathing, organs, the, first, pair, is, located, in, a, cavity, inside, the, lower, front, part, of, the, abdomen, near, where, the, abdomen, connects, to, the, cephalothorax, and, the, second, pair, is, slightly, farther, back, on, the, abdomen, air, enters, the, cavity, through, a, tiny, slit, on, each, side, of, and, near, the, front, of, the, abdomen, each, lung, consists, of, 15, or, more, thin, sheets, of, folded, tissue, arranged, like, the, pages, of, a, book, these, sheets, of, tissue, are, supplied, by, blood, vessels, as, air, enters, each, lung, oxygen, is, taken, into, the, blood, stream, through, the, blood, vessels, in, the, lungs, needed, moisture, may, also, be, absorbed, from, humid, air, by, these, organs, a, tarantula, s, blood, is, unique, not, only, in, appearance, an, oxygen, transporting, protein, is, present, the, copper, based, hemocyanin, but, not, enclosed, in, blood, cells, such, as, the, erythrocytes, of, mammals, a, tarantula, s, blood, is, not, true, blood, but, rather, a, liquid, called, hemolymph, or, haemolymph, at, least, four, types, of, hemocytes, or, hemolymph, cells, are, known, the, tarantula, s, heart, is, a, long, slender, tube, located, along, the, top, of, the, opisthosoma, the, heart, is, neurogenic, as, opposed, to, myogenic, so, nerve, cells, instead, of, muscle, cells, initiate, and, coordinate, the, heart, it, pumps, hemolymph, to, all, parts, of, the, body, through, open, passages, often, referred, to, as, sinuses, and, not, through, a, circular, system, of, blood, vessels, if, the, exoskeleton, is, breached, loss, of, hemolymph, will, kill, the, spider, unless, the, wound, is, small, enough, that, the, hemolymph, can, dry, and, close, it, despite, their, large, size, and, fearsome, appearance, and, reputation, tarantulas, themselves, are, prey, for, many, other, animals, the, most, specialized, of, these, predators, are, large, members, of, the, wasp, family, pompilidae, such, as, the, wasp, hemipepsis, ustulata, these, wasps, are, called, tarantula, hawks, the, largest, tarantula, hawks, such, as, those, in, the, genus, pepsis, track, attack, and, kill, large, tarantulas, they, use, olfaction, to, find, the, lair, of, a, tarantula, the, wasp, must, deliver, a, sting, to, the, underside, of, the, spider, s, cephalothorax, exploiting, the, thin, membrane, between, the, basal, leg, segments, this, paralyzes, the, spider, and, the, wasp, then, drags, it, back, into, its, burrow, before, depositing, an, egg, on, the, prey, s, abdomen, the, wasp, then, seals, the, spider, in, its, burrow, and, flies, off, to, search, for, more, hosts, the, wasp, egg, hatches, into, a, larva, and, feeds, on, the, spider, s, inessential, parts, and, as, it, approaches, pupation, it, consumes, the, remainder, other, arthropods, such, as, large, scorpions, and, giant, centipedes, are, also, known, to, prey, on, tarantulas, tarantulas, are, also, preyed, upon, by, a, wide, variety, of, vertebrates, many, of, these, including, lizards, frogs, birds, snakes, and, mammals, are, generalist, predators, of, all, kinds, of, large, arthropods, mammals, that, have, been, known, to, prey, on, tarantulas, such, as, the, coati, kinkajou, and, opossum, in, the, new, world, and, mongooses, and, the, honey, badger, in, the, old, world, are, often, immune, to, the, venom, of, their, arthropod, prey, humans, also, consume, tarantulas, for, food, in, their, native, ranges, they, are, considered, a, delicacy, in, certain, cultures, e, g, venezuela, and, cambodia, they, can, be, roasted, over, an, open, fire, to, remove, the, bristles, described, further, below, and, then, eaten, tarantulas, have, evolved, specialized, bristles, or, setae, to, defend, themselves, against, predators, besides, the, normal, bristles, covering, the, body, some, tarantulas, also, have, a, dense, covering, of, irritating, bristles, called, urticating, hairs, on, the, opisthosoma, that, they, sometimes, use, as, protection, against, enemies, these, bristles, are, present, on, most, new, world, species, but, not, on, any, specimens, from, the, old, world, urticating, hairs, are, usually, kicked, off, the, abdomen, by, the, tarantula, but, some, may, simply, rub, the, abdomen, against, the, target, like, the, genus, avicularia, these, fine, bristles, are, barbed, and, serve, to, irritate, they, can, be, lethal, to, small, animals, such, as, rodents, some, people, are, sensitive, to, these, bristles, and, develop, serious, itching, and, rashes, at, the, site, exposure, of, the, eyes, and, respiratory, system, to, urticating, hairs, should, be, strictly, avoided, species, with, urticating, hairs, can, kick, these, bristles, off, they, are, flicked, into, the, air, at, a, target, using, their, back, pairs, of, legs, tarantulas, also, use, these, bristles, for, other, purposes, such, as, to, mark, territory, or, to, line, their, shelters, the, latter, such, practice, may, discourage, flies, from, feeding, on, the, spiderlings, urticating, hairs, do, not, grow, back, but, are, replaced, with, each, molt, the, intensity, number, and, flotation, of, the, bristles, depends, on, the, species, of, tarantula, to, predators, and, other, enemies, these, bristles, can, range, from, being, lethal, to, simply, being, a, deterrent, with, humans, they, can, cause, irritation, to, eyes, nose, and, skin, and, more, dangerously, the, lungs, and, airways, if, inhaled, the, symptoms, range, from, species, to, species, from, person, to, person, from, a, burning, itch, to, a, minor, rash, in, some, cases, tarantula, bristles, have, caused, permanent, damage, to, human, eyes, some, setae, are, used, to, stridulate, which, makes, a, hissing, sound, these, bristles, are, usually, found, on, the, chelicerae, stridulation, seems, to, be, more, common, in, old, world, species, all, tarantulas, are, venomous, although, their, venom, is, not, deadly, to, humans, some, bites, cause, serious, discomfort, that, might, persist, for, several, days, in, general, the, effects, of, the, bites, of, all, kinds, of, tarantula, are, not, well, known, while, the, bites, of, many, species, are, known, to, be, no, worse, than, a, wasp, sting, accounts, of, bites, by, some, species, are, reported, to, be, very, painful, and, to, produce, intense, spasms, that, may, recur, over, a, period, of, several, days, the, venom, of, the, african, tarantula, pelinobius, muticus, also, causes, strong, hallucinations, for, poecilotheria, species, researchers, have, described, more, than, 20, bites, with, the, delayed, onset, of, severe, and, diffuse, muscle, cramps, lasting, for, several, days, that, in, most, cases, resolved, completely, with, the, use, of, benzodiazepines, and, magnesium, in, all, cases, seeking, medical, aid, is, advised, because, other, proteins, are, included, when, a, toxin, is, injected, some, individuals, may, suffer, severe, symptoms, due, to, an, allergic, reaction, rather, than, to, the, venom, such, allergic, effects, can, be, life, threatening, additionally, the, large, fangs, of, a, tarantula, can, inflict, painful, puncture, wounds, which, can, lead, to, secondary, bacterial, infections, if, not, properly, treated, before, biting, a, tarantula, may, signal, its, intention, to, attack, by, rearing, up, into, a, threat, posture, which, may, involve, raising, its, prosoma, and, lifting, its, front, legs, into, the, air, spreading, and, extending, its, fangs, and, in, certain, species, making, a, loud, hissing, by, stridulating, tarantulas, often, hold, this, position, for, longer, than, the, duration, of, the, original, threat, their, next, step, without, biting, may, be, to, slap, down, on, the, intruder, with, their, raised, front, legs, if, that, response, fails, to, deter, the, attacker, the, tarantulas, of, the, americas, may, next, turn, away, and, flick, urticating, hairs, toward, the, pursuing, predator, the, next, response, may, be, to, leave, the, scene, entirely, but, especially, if, no, line, of, retreat, is, available, their, final, response, may, also, be, to, whirl, suddenly, and, bite, some, tarantulas, are, well, known, to, give, dry, bites, i, e, they, may, defensively, bite, some, animal, that, intrudes, on, their, space, and, threatens, them, but, they, do, not, pump, venom, into, the, wound, new, world, tarantulas, those, indigenous, to, the, americas, have, bites, that, generally, pose, little, threat, to, humans, other, than, causing, localized, pain, most, of, them, are, equipped, with, urticating, hairs, on, their, abdomens, and, almost, always, throw, these, barbed, bristles, as, the, first, line, of, defense, these, bristles, irritate, sensitive, areas, of, the, body, and, especially, seem, to, target, curious, animals, that, may, sniff, these, bristles, into, the, mucous, membranes, of, the, nose, some, species, have, more, effective, urticating, bristles, than, others, the, goliath, birdeater, is, known, for, its, particularly, irritating, urticating, bristles, they, can, penetrate, the, cornea, so, eye, protection, should, be, worn, when, handling, such, tarantulas, old, world, tarantulas, have, no, urticating, bristles, and, are, more, likely, to, attack, when, disturbed, they, often, have, more, potent, medically, significant, venom, and, are, faster, and, much, more, nervous, and, defensive, than, new, world, species, some, dangerous, spider, species, are, related, to, tarantulas, and, are, frequently, confused, with, them, a, popular, urban, legend, maintains, that, deadly, varieties, of, tarantula, exist, somewhere, in, south, america, this, claim, is, often, made, without, identifying, a, particular, spider, although, the, banana, tarantula, is, sometimes, named, a, likely, candidate, for, the, true, identity, of, this, spider, is, the, dangerous, brazilian, wandering, spider, phoneutria, fera, of, the, family, ctenidae, as, it, is, sometimes, found, hiding, in, clusters, of, bananas, and, is, one, of, several, spiders, called, banana, spiders, it, is, not, technically, a, tarantula, but, it, is, fairly, large, 4, to, 5, inch, legspan, somewhat, hairy, and, is, highly, venomous, to, humans, another, dangerous, type, of, spiders, that, have, been, confused, with, tarantulas, are, the, australian, funnel, web, spiders, the, best, known, species, of, these, is, the, sydney, funnel, web, spider, atrax, robustus, a, spider, that, is, aggressive, highly, venomous, and, prior, to, the, development, of, antivenom, in, the, 1980s, was, responsible, for, numerous, deaths, in, australia, these, spiders, are, members, of, the, same, infraorder, as, tarantulas, mygalomorphae, some, australians, use, the, slang, term, triantelope, a, corruption, of, the, incorrect, term, tarantula, which, is, also, used, for, large, hairy, and, harmless, members, of, the, huntsman, spider, family, which, are, often, found, on, interior, household, walls, and, in, automobiles, some, tarantula, species, exhibit, pronounced, sexual, dimorphism, males, tend, to, be, smaller, especially, their, abdomens, which, can, appear, quite, narrow, and, may, be, dull, in, color, when, compared, to, their, female, counterparts, as, in, the, species, haplopelma, lividum, mature, male, tarantulas, also, may, have, tibial, hooks, on, their, front, legs, which, are, used, to, restrain, the, female, s, fangs, during, copulation, males, typically, have, longer, legs, than, the, females, a, juvenile, male, s, sex, can, be, determined, by, looking, at, a, cast, exuvia, for, epiandrous, fusillae, or, spermathecae, females, possess, spermathecae, except, for, the, species, sickius, longibulbi, and, encyocratella, olivacea, males, have, much, shorter, lifespans, than, females, because, they, die, relatively, soon, after, maturing, few, live, long, enough, for, a, postultimate, molt, which, is, unlikely, in, natural, habitats, because, they, are, vulnerable, to, predation, but, has, happened, in, captivity, though, rarely, most, males, do, not, live, through, this, molt, as, they, tend, to, get, their, emboli, mature, male, sexual, organs, on, pedipalps, stuck, in, the, molt, most, tarantula, fanciers, regard, females, as, more, desirable, as, pets, due, to, their, much, longer, lifespans, wild, caught, tarantulas, are, often, mature, males, because, they, wander, out, in, the, open, and, are, more, likely, to, be, caught, like, other, spiders, tarantulas, have, to, shed, their, exoskeleton, periodically, as, they, grow, a, process, called, molting, a, young, tarantula, may, do, this, several, times, a, year, as, a, part, of, the, maturation, process, while, full, grown, specimens, only, molt, once, a, year, or, less, or, sooner, to, replace, lost, limbs, or, lost, urticating, hairs, it, is, visibly, apparent, that, molting, is, imminent, when, the, exoskeleton, takes, on, a, darker, shade, if, a, tarantula, previously, used, its, urticating, hairs, the, bald, patch, turns, from, a, peach, color, to, deep, blue, the, tarantula, also, stops, feeding, and, becomes, more, lethargic, during, this, time, while, most, tarantulas, species, take, between, two, and, five, years, to, reach, sexual, maturity, some, species, can, take, up, to, 10, years, upon, reaching, adulthood, males, typically, have, an, 18, month, period, left, to, live, so, immediately, go, in, search, of, a, female, mate, although, females, continue, to, molt, after, reaching, maturity, males, rarely, do, again, once, they, reach, adulthood, those, that, do, often, can, become, stuck, during, the, molting, process, due, to, their, sexual, organs, and, die, females, can, live, for, 30, to, 40, years, grammostola, rosea, spiders, which, eat, once, or, twice, a, week, have, lived, up, to, 20, years, in, captivity, some, have, survived, on, water, alone, for, up, to, two, years, after, reaching, sexual, maturity, a, female, tarantula, normally, mates, and, lays, eggs, once, per, year, although, they, do, not, always, do, so, as, with, other, spiders, the, mechanics, of, intercourse, are, quite, different, from, those, of, mammals, once, a, male, spider, reaches, maturity, and, becomes, motivated, to, mate, he, weaves, a, web, mat, on, a, flat, surface, the, spider, then, rubs, his, abdomen, on, the, surface, of, this, mat, and, in, so, doing, releases, a, quantity, of, semen, he, may, then, insert, his, pedipalps, short, leg, like, appendages, between, the, chelicerae, and, front, legs, into, the, pool, of, semen, the, pedipalps, absorb, the, semen, and, keep, it, viable, until, a, mate, can, be, found, when, a, male, spider, detects, the, presence, of, a, female, the, two, exchange, signals, to, establish, that, they, are, of, the, same, species, these, signals, may, also, lull, the, female, into, a, receptive, state, if, the, female, is, receptive, then, the, male, approaches, her, and, inserts, his, pedipalps, into, an, opening, in, the, lower, surface, of, her, abdomen, the, opisthosoma, after, the, semen, has, been, transferred, to, the, receptive, female, s, body, the, male, swiftly, leaves, the, scene, before, the, female, recovers, her, appetite, although, females, may, show, some, aggression, after, mating, the, male, rarely, becomes, a, meal, females, deposit, 50, to, 2, 000, eggs, depending, on, the, species, in, a, silken, egg, sac, and, guard, it, for, six, to, eight, weeks, during, this, time, the, females, stay, very, close, to, the, egg, sacs, and, become, more, aggressive, within, most, species, the, females, turn, the, egg, sac, often, which, is, called, brooding, this, keeps, the, eggs, from, deforming, due, to, sitting, in, one, position, too, long, the, young, spiderlings, remain, in, the, nest, for, some, time, after, hatching, where, they, live, off, the, remains, of, their, yolk, sacs, before, dispersing, linnaeus, placed, all, spiders, in, a, single, genus, aranea, in, 1802, charles, athanase, walckenaer, separated, mygalomorph, spiders, into, a, separate, genus, mygale, leaving, all, other, spiders, in, aranea, however, mygale, had, already, been, used, in, 1800, by, georges, cuvier, for, a, genus, of, mammals, in, greek, mygale, means, shrew, accordingly, in, 1869, tamerlan, thorell, used, the, family, name, theraphosoidae, modern, theraphosidae, for, the, mygalomorph, spiders, known, to, him, rather, than, mygalidae, as, used, for, example, by, john, blackwall, thorell, later, split, the, family, into, a, number, of, genera, including, theraphosa, a, 2019, phylogenomic, study, recognized, 12, subfamilies, one, ischnocolinae, known, not, to, be, monophyletic, the, relationship, between, the, subfamilies, found, in, the, study, is, shown, in, the, following, cladogram, the, dual, placing, of, ischnocolinae, is, highlighted, ischnocolinae, catamiri, sp, eumenophorinae, thrigmopoeinae, selenocosmiinae, poecilotheriinae, ornithoctoninae, stromatopelminae, harpactirinae, ischnocolinae, trichopelma, laselva, aviculariinae, schismatothelinae, psalmopoeinae, theraphosinae, all, the, species, that, possess, urticating, hairs, and, have, been, seen, to, use, them, in, bombardment, behavior, are, placed, in, the, bombardier, clade, although, not, all, species, in, the, included, subfamilies, possess, such, hairs, all, schismatothelinae, lack, them, as, do, most, psalmopoeinae, genera, it, is, not, clear, whether, the, possession, of, urticating, hairs, was, an, ancestral, trait, of, the, clade, and, has, been, lost, in, some, species, or, whether, it, represents, multiple, gains, foley, et, al, suggested, that, the, second, hypothesis, appeared, to, be, better, supported, other, subfamilies, that, have, been, recognized, include, as, of, december, 2023, the, world, spider, catalog, accepted, the, following, genera, former, genera, fossils, of, mygalomorph, spiders, date, back, to, the, triassic, one, species, assigned, to, the, theraphosidae, is, protertheraphosa, spinipes, found, in, burmese, amber, which, is, dated, to, the, mid, and, late, cretaceous
