crocodiles, family, crocodylidae, or, true, crocodiles, are, large, semiaquatic, reptiles, that, live, throughout, the, tropics, in, africa, asia, the, americas, and, australia, the, term, crocodile, is, sometimes, used, even, more, loosely, to, include, all, extant, members, of, the, order, crocodilia, which, includes, the, alligators, and, caimans, family, alligatoridae, the, gharial, and, false, gharial, family, gavialidae, among, other, extinct, taxa, although, they, appear, similar, crocodiles, alligators, and, the, gharial, belong, to, separate, biological, families, the, gharial, with, its, narrow, snout, is, easier, to, distinguish, while, morphological, differences, are, more, difficult, to, spot, in, crocodiles, and, alligators, the, most, obvious, external, differences, are, visible, in, the, head, with, crocodiles, having, narrower, and, longer, heads, with, a, more, v, shaped, than, a, u, shaped, snout, compared, to, alligators, and, caimans, another, obvious, trait, is, that, the, upper, and, lower, jaws, of, the, crocodiles, are, the, same, width, and, the, teeth, in, the, lower, jaw, fall, along, the, edge, or, outside, the, upper, jaw, when, the, mouth, is, closed, therefore, all, teeth, are, visible, unlike, an, alligator, which, possesses, in, the, upper, jaw, small, depressions, into, which, the, lower, teeth, fit, also, when, the, crocodile, s, mouth, is, closed, the, large, fourth, tooth, in, the, lower, jaw, fits, into, a, constriction, in, the, upper, jaw, for, hard, to, distinguish, specimens, the, protruding, tooth, is, the, most, reliable, feature, to, define, the, species, family, crocodiles, have, more, webbing, on, the, toes, of, the, hind, feet, and, can, better, tolerate, saltwater, due, to, specialized, salt, glands, for, filtering, out, salt, which, are, present, but, non, functioning, in, alligators, another, trait, that, separates, crocodiles, from, other, crocodilians, is, their, much, higher, levels, of, aggression, crocodile, size, morphology, behaviour, and, ecology, differ, somewhat, among, species, however, they, have, many, similarities, in, these, areas, as, well, all, crocodiles, are, semiaquatic, and, tend, to, congregate, in, freshwater, habitats, such, as, rivers, lakes, wetlands, and, sometimes, in, brackish, water, and, saltwater, they, are, carnivorous, animals, feeding, mostly, on, vertebrates, such, as, fish, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, and, sometimes, on, invertebrates, such, as, molluscs, and, crustaceans, depending, on, species, and, age, all, crocodiles, are, tropical, species, that, unlike, alligators, are, very, sensitive, to, cold, they, separated, from, other, crocodilians, during, the, eocene, epoch, about, 55, million, years, ago, many, species, are, at, the, risk, of, extinction, some, being, classified, as, critically, endangered, the, word, crocodile, comes, from, ancient, greek, krok, dilos, lizard, used, in, the, phrase, ho, krok, dilos, tou, potamo, the, lizard, of, the, nile, river, there, are, several, variant, greek, forms, of, the, word, attested, including, the, later, form, krok, deilos, found, cited, in, many, english, reference, works, in, the, koine, greek, of, roman, times, krokodilos, and, krokodeilos, would, have, been, pronounced, identically, and, either, or, both, may, be, the, source, of, the, latinized, form, crocod, lus, used, by, the, ancient, romans, it, has, been, suggested, but, it, is, not, certain, that, the, word, crocodilos, or, crocodeilos, is, a, compound, of, krok, pebbles, and, drilos, dreilos, worm, although, drilos, is, only, attested, as, a, colloquial, term, for, penis, it, is, ascribed, to, herodotus, and, supposedly, describes, the, basking, habits, of, the, egyptian, crocodile, the, form, crocodrillus, is, attested, in, medieval, latin, it, is, not, clear, whether, this, is, a, medieval, corruption, or, derives, from, alternative, greco, latin, forms, late, greek, corcodrillos, and, corcodrillion, are, attested, a, further, corrupted, form, cocodrille, is, found, in, old, french, and, was, borrowed, into, middle, english, as, cocodril, le, the, modern, english, form, crocodile, was, adapted, directly, from, the, classical, latin, crocod, lus, in, the, 16th, century, replacing, the, earlier, form, the, use, of, y, in, the, scientific, name, crocodylus, and, forms, derived, from, it, is, a, corruption, introduced, by, laurenti, 1768, crocodylidae, was, named, as, a, family, by, georges, cuvier, in, 1807, it, belongs, to, the, larger, superfamily, crocodyloidea, which, also, includes, additional, extinct, crocodile, relatives, these, all, belong, to, the, order, crocodilia, which, also, includes, alligators, and, gharials, crocodylidae, is, cladistically, defined, as, a, crown, group, composed, of, the, last, common, ancestor, of, the, nile, crocodile, crocodylus, niloticus, the, dwarf, crocodile, osteolaemus, tetraspis, and, all, of, its, descendants, it, contains, two, subfamilies, crocodylinae, and, osteolaeminae, crocodylinae, contains, 13, 14, living, species, as, well, as, 6, extinct, species, osteolaeminae, was, named, by, christopher, brochu, in, 2003, as, a, subfamily, of, crocodylidae, separate, from, crocodylinae, and, contains, the, two, extant, genera, osteolaemus, and, mecistops, along, with, several, extinct, genera, the, number, of, extant, species, within, osteolaeminae, is, currently, in, question, recent, molecular, studies, using, dna, sequencing, have, shown, crocodiles, to, be, more, closely, related, to, the, gavialids, rather, than, to, alligators, contrary, to, prior, theories, based, on, morphological, studies, alone, below, is, a, cladogram, showing, the, relationships, of, the, major, extant, crocodile, groups, based, on, molecular, studies, excluding, separate, extinct, taxa, caiman, melanosuchus, paleosuchus, alligator, crocodylus, mecistops, osteolaemus, gavialis, tomistoma, below, is,

needed, for, the, confirmation, of, proposed, species, under, the, genus, osteolaemus, a, crocodile, s, physical, traits, allow, it, to, be, a, successful, predator, its, external, morphology, is, a, sign, of, its, aquatic, and, predatory, lifestyle, its, streamlined, body, enables, it, to, swim, swiftly, it, also, tucks, its, feet, to, the, side, while, swimming, making, it, faster, by, decreasing, water, resistance, crocodiles, have, webbed, feet, which, though, not, used, to, propel, them, through, the, water, allow, them, to, make, fast, turns, and, sudden, moves, in, the, water, or, initiate, swimming, webbed, feet, are, an, advantage, in, shallow, water, where, the, animals, sometimes, move, around, by, walking, crocodiles, have, a, palatal, flap, a, rigid, tissue, at, the, back, of, the, mouth, that, blocks, the, entry, of, water, the, palate, has, a, special, path, from, the, nostril, to, the, glottis, that, bypasses, the, mouth, the, nostrils, are, closed, during, submergence, like, other, archosaurs, crocodilians, are, diapsid, although, their, post, temporal, fenestrae, are, reduced, the, walls, of, the, braincase, are, bony, but, lack, supratemporal, and, postfrontal, bones, their, tongues, are, not, free, but, held, in, place, by, a, membrane, that, limits, movement, as, a, result, crocodiles, are, unable, to, stick, out, their, tongues, crocodiles, have, smooth, skin, on, their, bellies, and, sides, while, their, dorsal, surfaces, are, armoured, with, large, osteoderms, the, armoured, skin, has, scales, and, is, thick, and, rugged, providing, some, protection, they, are, still, able, to, absorb, heat, through, this, armour, as, a, network, of, small, capillaries, allows, blood, through, the, scales, to, absorb, heat, the, osteoderms, are, highly, vascularised, and, aid, in, calcium, balance, both, to, neutralize, acids, while, the, animal, cannot, breathe, underwater, and, to, provide, calcium, for, eggshell, formation, crocodilian, tegument, have, pores, believed, to, be, sensory, in, function, analogous, to, the, lateral, line, in, fishes, they, are, particularly, seen, on, their, upper, and, lower, jaws, another, possibility, is, that, they, are, secretory, as, they, produce, an, oily, substance, which, appears, to, flush, mud, off, size, greatly, varies, among, species, from, the, dwarf, crocodile, to, the, saltwater, crocodile, species, of, the, dwarf, crocodile, osteolaemus, grow, to, an, adult, size, of, just, 1, 5, to, 1, 9, m, 4, 9, to, 6, 2, ft, whereas, the, saltwater, crocodile, can, grow, to, sizes, over, 6, m, 20, ft, and, weigh, over, 1, 000, kg, 2, 200, lb, several, other, large, species, can, reach, over, 5, 2, m, 17, ft, long, and, weigh, over, 900, kg, 2, 000, lb, crocodilians, show, pronounced, sexual, dimorphism, with, males, growing, much, larger, and, more, rapidly, than, females, despite, their, large, adult, sizes, crocodiles, start, their, lives, at, around, 20, cm, 7, 9, in, long, the, largest, species, of, crocodile, is, the, saltwater, crocodile, found, in, eastern, india, northern, australia, throughout, south, east, asia, and, in, the, surrounding, waters, the, brain, volume, of, two, adult, crocodiles, was, 5, 6, cm, 3, for, a, spectacled, caiman, and, 8, 5, cm, 3, for, a, larger, nile, crocodile, the, largest, crocodile, ever, held, in, captivity, is, a, saltwater, siamese, hybrid, named, yai, thai, meaning, big, born, 10, june, 1972, at, the, samutprakarn, crocodile, farm, and, zoo, thailand, this, animal, measures, 6, m, 20, ft, in, length, and, weighs, 1, 200, kg, 2, 600, lb, the, longest, crocodile, captured, alive, was, lolong, a, saltwater, crocodile, which, was, measured, at, 6, 17, m, 20, 2, ft, and, weighed, at, 1, 075, kg, 2, 370, lb, by, a, national, geographic, team, in, agusan, del, sur, province, philippines, crocodiles, are, polyphyodonts, they, are, able, to, replace, each, of, their, 80, teeth, up, to, 50, times, in, their, 35, to, 75, year, lifespan, next, to, each, full, grown, tooth, there, is, a, small, replacement, tooth, and, an, odontogenic, stem, cell, in, the, dental, lamina, in, standby, that, can, be, activated, if, required, crocodilians, are, more, closely, related, to, birds, and, dinosaurs, than, to, most, animals, classified, as, reptiles, the, three, families, being, included, in, the, group, archosauria, ruling, reptiles, despite, their, prehistoric, look, crocodiles, are, among, the, more, biologically, complex, reptiles, unlike, other, reptiles, a, crocodile, has, a, cerebral, cortex, and, a, four, chambered, heart, crocodilians, also, have, the, functional, equivalent, of, a, diaphragm, by, incorporating, muscles, used, for, aquatic, locomotion, into, respiration, salt, glands, are, present, in, the, tongues, of, crocodiles, and, they, have, a, pore, opening, on, the, surface, of, the, tongue, a, trait, that, separates, them, from, alligators, salt, glands, are, dysfunctional, in, alligatoridae, their, function, appears, to, be, similar, to, that, of, salt, glands, in, marine, turtles, crocodiles, do, not, have, sweat, glands, and, release, heat, through, their, mouths, they, often, sleep, with, their, mouths, open, and, may, pant, like, a, dog, four, species, of, freshwater, crocodile, climb, trees, to, bask, in, areas, lacking, a, shoreline, crocodiles, have, acute, senses, an, evolutionary, advantage, that, makes, them, successful, predators, the, eyes, ears, and, nostrils, are, located, on, top, of, the, head, allowing, the, crocodile, to, lie, low, in, the, water, almost, totally, submerged, and, hidden, from, prey, crocodiles, have, very, good, night, vision, and, are, mostly, nocturnal, hunters, they, use, the, disadvantage, of, most, prey, animals, poor, nocturnal, vision, to, their, advantage, the, light, receptors, in, crocodilians, eyes, include, cones, and, numerous, rods, so, it, is, assumed, all, crocodilians, can, see, colours, crocodiles, have, vertical, slit, shaped, pupils, similar, to, those, of, domestic, cats, one, explanation, for, the, evolution, of, slit, pupils, is, that, they, exclude, light, more, effectively, than, a, circular, pupil, helping, to, protect, the, eyes, during, daylight, on, the, rear, wall, of, the, eye, is, a, tapetum, lucidum, which, reflects, incoming, light, back, onto, the, retina, thus, utilizing, the, small, amount, of, light, available, at, night, to, best, advantage, in, addition, to, the, protection, of, the, upper, and, lower, eyelids, crocodiles, have, a, nictitating, membrane, sometimes, called, a, third, eye, lid, that, can, be, drawn, over, the, eye, from, the, inner, corner, while, the, lids, are, open, the, eyeball, surface, is, thus, protected, under, the, water, while, a, certain, degree, of, vision, is, still, possible, crocodilian, sense, of, smell, is, also, very, well, developed, aiding, them, to, detect, prey, or, animal, carcasses, that, are, either, on, land, or, in, water, from, far, away, it, is, possible, that, crocodiles, use, olfaction, in, the, egg, prior, to, hatching, chemoreception, in, crocodiles, is, especially, interesting, because, they, hunt, in, both, terrestrial, and, aquatic, surroundings, crocodiles, have, only, one, olfactory, chamber, and, the, vomeronasal, organ, is, absent, in, the, adults, indicating, all, olfactory, perception, is, limited, to, the, olfactory, system, behavioural, and, olfactometer, experiments, indicate, that, crocodiles, detect, both, air, borne, and, water, soluble, chemicals, and, use, their, olfactory, system, for, hunting, when, above, water, crocodiles, enhance, their, ability, to, detect, volatile, odorants, by, gular, pumping, a, rhythmic, movement, of, the, floor, of, the, pharynx, crocodiles, close, their, nostrils, when, submerged, so, olfaction, underwater, is, unlikely, underwater, food, detection, is, presumably, gustatory, and, tactile, crocodiles, can, hear, well, their, tympanic, membranes, are, concealed, by, flat, flaps, that, may, be, raised, or, lowered, by, muscles, the, touch, sensors, concentrated, in, crocodile, skin, can, be, thicker, than, those, in, human, fingerprints, crocodiles, can, feel, the, touch, on, their, skin, cranial, the, upper, and, lower, jaws, are, covered, with, sensory, pits, visible, as, small, black, speckles, on, the, skin, the, crocodilian, version, of, the, lateral, line, organs, seen, in, fish, and, many, amphibians, though, arising, from, a, completely, different, origin, these, pigmented, nodules, encase, bundles, of, nerve, fibers, innervated, beneath, by, branches, of, the, trigeminal, nerve, they, respond, to, the, slightest, disturbance, in, surface, water, detecting, vibrations, and, small, pressure, changes, as, small, as, a, single, drop, this, makes, it, possible, for, crocodiles, to, detect, prey, danger, and, intruders, even, in, total, darkness, these, sense, organs, are, known, as, domed, pressure, receptors, dprs, post, cranial, while, alligators, and, caimans, have, dprs, only, on, their, jaws, crocodiles, have, similar, organs, on, almost, every, scale, on, their, bodies, the, function, of, the, dprs, on, the, jaws, is, clear, to, catch, prey, but, it, is, still, not, clear, what, the, function, is, of, the, organs, on, the, rest, of, the, body, the, receptors, flatten, when, exposed, to, increased, osmotic, pressure, such, as, that, experienced, when, swimming, in, sea, water, hyperosmotic, to, the, body, fluids, when, contact, between, the, integument, and, the, surrounding, sea, water, solution, is, blocked, crocodiles, are, found, to, lose, their, ability, to, discriminate, salinities, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, flattening, of, the, sensory, organ, in, hyperosmotic, sea, water, is, sensed, by, the, animal, as, touch, but, interpreted, as, chemical, information, about, its, surroundings, this, might, be, why, in, alligators, they, are, absent, on, the, rest, of, the, body, crocodiles, are, ambush, predators, waiting, for, fish, or, land, animals, to, come, close, then, rushing, out, to, attack, crocodiles, mostly, eat, fish, amphibians, crustaceans, molluscs, birds, reptiles, and, mammals, and, they, occasionally, cannibalize, smaller, crocodiles, what, a, crocodile, eats, varies, greatly, with, species, size, and, age, from, the, mostly, fish, eating, species, like, the, slender, snouted, and, freshwater, crocodiles, to, the, larger, species, like, the, nile, crocodile, and, the, saltwater, crocodile, that, prey, on, large, mammals, such, as, buffalo, deer, and, wild, boar, diet, shows, great, diversity, diet, is, also, greatly, affected, by, the, size, and, age, of, the, individual, within, the, same, species, all, young, crocodiles, hunt, mostly, invertebrates, and, small, fish, gradually, moving, on, to, larger, prey, being, ectothermic, cold, blooded, predators, they, have, a, very, slow, metabolism, so, they, can, survive, long, periods, without, food, despite, their, appearance, of, being, slow, crocodiles, have, a, very, fast, strike, and, are, top, predators, in, their, environment, and, various, species, have, been, observed, attacking, and, killing, other, predators, such, as, sharks, and, big, cats, crocodiles, are, also, known, to, be, aggressive, scavengers, who, feed, upon, carrion, and, steal, from, other, predators, evidence, suggests, that, crocodiles, also, feed, upon, fruits, based, on, the, discovery, of, seeds, in, stools, and, stomachs, from, many, subjects, as, well, as, accounts, of, them, feeding, crocodiles, have, the, most, acidic, stomach, of, any, vertebrate, they, can, easily, digest, bones, hooves, and, horns, the, bbc, tv, reported, that, a, nile, crocodile, that, has, lurked, a, long, time, underwater, to, catch, prey, builds, up, a, large, oxygen, debt, when, it, has, caught, and, eaten, that, prey, it, closes, its, right, aortic, arch, and, uses, its, left, aortic, arch, to, flush, blood, loaded, with, carbon, dioxide, from, its, muscles, directly, to, its, stomach, the, resulting, excess, acidity, in, its, blood, supply, makes, it, much, easier, for, the, stomach, lining, to, secrete, more, stomach, acid, to, quickly, dissolve, bulks, of, swallowed, prey, flesh, and, bone, many, large, crocodilians, swallow, stones, called, gastroliths, or, stomach, stones, which, may, act, as, ballast, to, balance, their, bodies, or, assist, in, crushing, food, similar, to, grit, ingested, by, birds, herodotus, claimed, that, nile, crocodiles, had, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, certain, birds, such, as, the, egyptian, plover, which, enter, the, crocodile, s, mouth, and, pick, leeches, feeding, on, the, crocodile, s, blood, with, no, evidence, of, this, interaction, actually, occurring, in, any, crocodile, species, it, is, most, likely, mythical, or, allegorical, fiction, since, they, feed, by, grabbing, and, holding, onto, their, prey, they, have, evolved, sharp, teeth, for, piercing, and, holding, onto, flesh, and, powerful, muscles, to, close, the, jaws, and, hold, them, shut, the, teeth, are, not, well, suited, to, tearing, flesh, off, of, large, prey, items, as, are, the, dentition, and, claws, of, many, mammalian, carnivores, the, hooked, bills, and, talons, of, raptorial, birds, or, the, serrated, teeth, of, sharks, however, this, is, an, advantage, rather, than, a, disadvantage, to, the, crocodile, since, the, properties, of, the, teeth, allow, it, to, hold, onto, prey, with, the, least, possibility, of, the, prey, animal, escaping, cutting, teeth, combined, with, the, exceptionally, high, bite, force, would, pass, through, flesh, easily, enough, to, leave, an, escape, opportunity, for, prey, the, jaws, can, bite, down, with, immense, force, by, far, the, strongest, bite, of, any, animal, the, force, of, a, large, crocodile, s, bite, is, more, than, 5, 000, lbf, 22, 000, n, which, was, measured, in, a, 5, 5, m, 18, ft, nile, crocodile, in, the, field, comparing, to, 335, lbf, 1, 490, n, for, a, rottweiler, 800, lbf, 3, 600, n, for, a, hyena, 2, 200, lbf, 9, 800, n, for, an, american, alligator, and, 4, 095, lbf, 18, 220, n, for, the, largest, confirmed, great, white, shark, a, 5, 2, m, 17, ft, long, saltwater, crocodile, has, been, confirmed, as, having, the, strongest, bite, force, ever, recorded, for, an, animal, in, a, laboratory, setting, it, was, able, to, apply, a, bite, force, value, of, 3, 700, lbf, 16, 000, n, and, thus, surpassed, the, previous, record, of, 2, 125, lbf, 9, 450, n, made, by, a, 3, 9, m, 13, ft, long, american, alligator, taking, the, measurements, of, several, 5, 2, m, 17, ft, crocodiles, as, reference, the, bite, forces, of, 6, m, individuals, were, estimated, at, 7, 700, lbf, 34, 000, n, the, study, led, by, dr, gregory, m, erickson, also, shed, light, on, the, larger, extinct, species, of, crocodilians, since, crocodile, anatomy, has, changed, only, slightly, over, the, last, 80, million, years, current, data, on, modern, crocodilians, can, be, used, to, estimate, the, bite, force, of, extinct, species, an, 11, to, 12, metre, 36, 39, ft, deinosuchus, would, apply, a, force, of, 23, 100, lbf, 103, 000, n, nearly, twice, that, of, the, latest, higher, bite, force, estimations, of, tyrannosaurus, 12, 814, lbf, 57, 000, n, the, extraordinary, bite, of, crocodilians, is, a, result, of, their, anatomy, the, space, for, the, jaw, muscle, in, the, skull, is, very, large, which, is, easily, visible, from, the, outside, as, a, bulge, at, each, side, the, muscle, is, so, stiff, it, is, almost, as, hard, as, bone, to, touch, as, if, it, were, the, continuum, of, the, skull, another, trait, is, that, most, of, the, muscle, in, a, crocodile, s, jaw, is, arranged, for, clamping, down, despite, the, strong, muscles, to, close, the, jaw, crocodiles, have, extremely, small, and, weak, muscles, to, open, the, jaw, crocodiles, can, thus, be, subdued, for, study, or, transport, by, taping, their, jaws, or, holding, their, jaws, shut, with, large, rubber, bands, cut, from, automobile, inner, tubes, crocodiles, can, move, quickly, over, short, distances, even, out, of, water, the, land, speed, record, for, a, crocodile, is, 17, km, h, 11, mph, measured, in, a, galloping, australian, freshwater, crocodile, maximum, speed, varies, between, species, some, species, can, gallop, including, cuban, crocodiles, johnston, s, crocodiles, new, guinea, crocodiles, african, dwarf, crocodiles, and, even, small, nile, crocodiles, the, fastest, means, by, which, most, species, can, move, is, a, belly, run, in, which, the, body, moves, in, a, snake, like, sinusoidal, fashion, limbs, splayed, out, to, either, side, paddling, away, frantically, while, the, tail, whips, to, and, fro, crocodiles, can, reach, speeds, of, 10, 11, km, h, 6, 7, mph, when, they, belly, run, and, often, faster, if, slipping, down, muddy, riverbanks, when, a, crocodile, walks, quickly, it, holds, its, legs, in, a, straighter, and, more, upright, position, under, its, body, which, is, called, the, high, walk, this, walk, allows, a, speed, of, up, to, 5, km, h, crocodiles, may, possess, a, homing, instinct, in, northern, australia, three, rogue, saltwater, crocodiles, were, relocated, 400, km, 249, mi, by, helicopter, but, returned, to, their, original, locations, within, three, weeks, based, on, data, obtained, from, tracking, devices, attached, to, them, measuring, crocodile, age, is, unreliable, although, several, techniques, are, used, to, derive, a, reasonable, guess, the, most, common, method, is, to, measure, lamellar, growth, rings, in, bones, and, teeth, each, ring, corresponds, to, a, change, in, growth, rate, which, typically, occurs, once, a, year, between, dry, and, wet, seasons, bearing, these, inaccuracies, in, mind, it, can, be, safely, said, that, all, crocodile, species, have, an, average, lifespan, of, at, least, 30, 40, years, and, in, the, case, of, larger, species, an, average, of, 60, 70, years, the, oldest, crocodiles, appear, to, be, the, largest, species, c, porosus, is, estimated, to, live, around, 70, years, on, average, with, limited, evidence, of, some, individuals, exceeding, 100, years, in, captivity, some, individuals, are, claimed, to, have, lived, for, over, a, century, a, male, crocodile, lived, to, an, estimated, age, of, 110, 115, years, in, a, russian, zoo, in, yekaterinburg, named, kolya, he, joined, the, zoo, around, 1913, to, 1915, fully, grown, after, touring, in, an, animal, show, and, lived, until, 1995, a, male, freshwater, crocodile, lived, to, an, estimated, age, of, 120, 140, years, at, the, australia, zoo, known, affectionately, as, mr, freshie, he, was, rescued, around, 1970, by, bob, irwin, and, steve, irwin, after, being, shot, twice, by, hunters, and, losing, an, eye, as, a, result, and, lived, until, 2010, crocworld, conservation, centre, in, scottburgh, south, africa, claims, to, have, a, male, nile, crocodile, that, was, born, in, 1900, named, henry, the, crocodile, is, said, to, have, lived, in, botswana, along, the, okavango, river, according, to, centre, director, martin, rodrigues, crocodiles, are, the, most, social, of, reptiles, even, though, they, do, not, form, social, groups, many, species, congregate, in, certain, sections, of, rivers, tolerating, each, other, at, times, of, feeding, and, basking, most, species, are, not, highly, territorial, with, the, exception, of, the, saltwater, crocodile, which, is, a, highly, territorial, and, aggressive, species, a, mature, male, saltwater, crocodile, will, not, tolerate, any, other, males, at, any, time, of, the, year, but, most, other, species, are, more, flexible, there, is, a, certain, form, of, hierarchy, in, crocodiles, the, largest, and, heaviest, males, are, at, the, top, having, access, to, the, best, basking, site, while, females, are, priority, during, a, group, feeding, of, a, big, kill, or, carcass, a, good, example, of, the, hierarchy, in, crocodiles, would, be, the, case, of, the, nile, crocodile, this, species, clearly, displays, all, of, these, behaviours, studies, in, this, area, are, not, thorough, however, and, many, species, are, yet, to, be, studied, in, greater, detail, mugger, crocodiles, are, also, known, to, show, toleration, in, group, feedings, and, tend, to, congregate, in, certain, areas, however, males, of, all, species, are, aggressive, towards, each, other, during, mating, season, to, gain, access, to, females, crocodiles, are, also, the, most, vocal, of, all, reptiles, producing, a, wide, variety, of, sounds, during, various, situations, and, conditions, depending, on, species, age, size, and, sex, depending, on, the, context, some, species, can, communicate, over, 20, different, messages, through, vocalizations, alone, some, of, these, vocalizations, are, made, during, social, communication, especially, during, territorial, displays, towards, the, same, sex, and, courtship, with, the, opposite, sex, the, common, concern, being, reproduction, therefore, most, conspecific, vocalization, is, made, during, the, breeding, season, with, the, exception, being, year, round, territorial, behaviour, in, some, species, and, quarrels, during, feeding, crocodiles, also, produce, different, distress, calls, and, in, aggressive, displays, to, their, own, kind, and, other, animals, notably, other, predators, during, interspecific, predatory, confrontations, over, carcasses, and, terrestrial, kills, specific, vocalisations, include, crocodiles, lay, eggs, which, are, laid, in, either, holes, or, mound, nests, depending, on, species, a, hole, nest, is, usually, excavated, in, sand, and, a, mound, nest, is, usually, constructed, out, of, vegetation, nesting, periods, range, from, a, few, weeks, up, to, six, months, courtship, takes, place, in, a, series, of, behavioural, interactions, that, include, a, variety, of, snout, rubbing, and, submissive, display, that, can, take, a, long, time, mating, always, takes, place, in, water, where, the, pair, can, be, observed, mating, several, times, females, can, build, or, dig, several, trial, nests, which, appear, incomplete, and, abandoned, later, egg, laying, usually, takes, place, at, night, and, about, 30, 40, minutes, females, are, highly, protective, of, their, nests, and, young, the, eggs, are, hard, shelled, but, translucent, at, the, time, of, egg, laying, depending, on, the, species, of, crocodile, 7, to, 95, eggs, are, laid, crocodile, embryos, do, not, have, sex, chromosomes, and, unlike, humans, sex, is, not, determined, genetically, sex, is, determined, by, temperature, where, at, 30, c, 86, f, or, less, most, hatchlings, are, females, and, at, 31, c, 88, f, offspring, are, of, both, sexes, a, temperature, of, 32, to, 33, c, 90, to, 91, f, gives, mostly, males, whereas, above, 33, c, 91, f, in, some, species, continues, to, give, males, but, in, other, species, resulting, in, females, which, are, sometimes, called, high, temperature, females, temperature, also, affects, growth, and, survival, rate, of, the, young, which, may, explain, the, sexual, dimorphism, in, crocodiles, the, average, incubation, period, is, around, 80, days, and, also, is, dependent, on, temperature, and, species, that, usually, ranges, from, 65, to, 95, days, the, eggshell, structure, is, very, conservative, through, evolution, but, there, are, enough, changes, to, tell, different, species, apart, by, their, eggshell, microstructure, scutes, may, play, a, role, in, calcium, storage, for, eggshell, formation, at, the, time, of, hatching, the, young, start, calling, within, the, eggs, they, have, an, egg, tooth, at, the, tip, of, their, snouts, which, is, developed, from, the, skin, and, that, helps, them, pierce, out, of, the, shell, hearing, the, calls, the, female, usually, excavates, the, nest, and, sometimes, takes, the, unhatched, eggs, in, her, mouth, slowly, rolling, the, eggs, to, help, the, process, the, young, is, usually, carried, to, the, water, in, the, mouth, she, would, then, introduce, her, hatchlings, to, the, water, and, even, feed, them, the, mother, would, then, take, care, of, her, young, for, over, a, year, before, the, next, mating, season, in, the, absence, of, the, mother, crocodile, the, father, would, act, in, her, place, to, take, care, of, the, young, however, even, with, a, sophisticated, parental, nurturing, young, crocodiles, have, a, very, high, mortality, rate, due, to, their, vulnerability, to, predation, a, group, of, hatchlings, is, called, a, pod, or, cr, che, and, may, be, protected, for, months, crocodiles, possess, some, advanced, cognitive, abilities, they, can, observe, and, use, patterns, of, prey, behaviour, such, as, when, prey, come, to, the, river, to, drink, at, the, same, time, each, day, vladimir, dinets, of, the, university, of, tennessee, observed, that, crocodiles, use, twigs, as, bait, for, birds, looking, for, nesting, material, they, place, sticks, on, their, snouts, and, partly, submerge, themselves, when, the, birds, swooped, in, to, get, the, sticks, the, crocodiles, then, catch, the, birds, crocodiles, only, do, this, in, spring, nesting, seasons, of, the, birds, when, there, is, high, demand, for, sticks, to, be, used, for, building, nests, vladimir, also, discovered, other, similar, observations, from, various, scientists, some, dating, back, to, the, 19th, century, aside, from, using, sticks, crocodiles, are, also, capable, of, cooperative, hunting, large, numbers, of, crocodiles, swim, in, circles, to, trap, fish, and, take, turns, snatching, them, in, hunting, larger, prey, crocodiles, swarm, in, with, one, holding, the, prey, down, as, the, others, rip, it, apart, according, to, a, 2015, study, crocodiles, engage, in, all, three, main, types, of, play, behaviour, recorded, in, animals, locomotor, play, play, with, objects, and, social, play, play, with, objects, is, reported, most, often, but, locomotor, play, such, as, repeatedly, sliding, down, slopes, and, social, play, such, as, riding, on, the, backs, of, other, crocodiles, is, also, reported, this, behaviour, was, exhibited, with, conspecifics, and, mammals, and, is, apparently, not, uncommon, though, has, been, difficult, to, observe, and, interpret, in, the, past, due, to, obvious, dangers, of, interacting, with, large, carnivores, the, larger, species, of, crocodiles, are, very, dangerous, to, humans, mainly, because, of, their, ability, to, strike, before, the, person, can, react, the, saltwater, crocodile, and, nile, crocodile, are, the, most, dangerous, killing, hundreds, of, people, each, year, in, parts, of, southeast, asia, and, africa, the, mugger, crocodile, and, american, crocodile, are, also, dangerous, to, humans, crocodiles, are, protected, in, many, parts, of, the, world, but, are, also, farmed, commercially, their, hides, are, tanned, and, used, to, make, leather, goods, such, as, shoes, and, handbags, crocodile, meat, is, also, considered, a, delicacy, the, most, commonly, farmed, species, are, the, saltwater, and, nile, crocodiles, while, a, hybrid, of, the, saltwater, and, the, rare, siamese, crocodile, is, also, bred, in, asian, farms, farming, has, resulted, in, an, increase, in, the, saltwater, crocodile, population, in, australia, as, eggs, are, usually, harvested, from, the, wild, so, landowners, have, an, incentive, to, conserve, their, habitat, crocodile, leather, can, be, made, into, goods, such, as, wallets, briefcases, purses, handbags, belts, hats, and, shoes, crocodile, oil, has, been, used, for, various, purposes, crocodiles, were, eaten, by, vietnamese, while, they, were, taboo, and, off, limits, for, chinese, vietnamese, women, who, married, chinese, men, adopted, the, chinese, taboo, crocodile, meat, is, consumed, in, some, countries, such, as, australia, ethiopia, thailand, south, africa, china, and, cuba, in, pickled, form, it, is, also, occasionally, eaten, as, an, exotic, delicacy, in, the, western, world, cuts, of, meat, include, backstrap, and, tail, fillet, due, to, high, demand, for, crocodile, products, traffic, states, that, 1, 418, 487, nile, crocodile, skins, were, exported, from, africa, between, 2006, and, 2015, aboriginal, australians, harvested, eggs, and, hunted, crocodiles, in, a, sustainable, way, for, many, thousands, of, years, the, brinkin, people, aka, marrithiyal, of, the, daly, river, in, the, northern, territory, nt, used, harpoons, and, bamboo, and, even, their, own, hands, to, capture, crocodiles, for, food, after, settlement, of, northern, australia, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, non, indigenous, people, killed, individual, crocodiles, mostly, by, locals, to, protect, the, population, or, novelty, seeking, visitors, or, just, opportunistically, so, numbers, were, not, noticeably, reduced, from, the, 1930s, commercial, hunting, began, with, aboriginal, people, often, employed, to, kill, the, crocodiles, using, traditional, methods, from, the, 1940s, to, the, 1960s, hunting, began, on, a, larger, scale, using, 303, rifles, they, were, hunted, for, leather, with, the, skins, shipped, to, plants, in, capital, cities, western, australia, banned, hunting, freshwater, crocodiles, in, 1962, and, saltwater, crocodiles, in, 1970, while, nt, bans, were, brought, in, 1964, and, 1971, queensland, did, not, pass, such, legislation, the, federal, government, later, banned, the, export, of, crocodile, skins, which, brought, commercial, hunting, to, an, end, in, queensland, they, have, been, a, protected, species, since, the, 1970s, when, numbers, were, down, to, approximately, 3, 000, in, the, nt, at, the, lowest, estimate, in, 2021, after, several, attacks, on, humans, by, the, salties, and, an, estimated, population, of, around, 200, 000, had, been, reached, queensland, politician, bob, katter, called, for, the, reintroduction, of, hunting, crocodiles, have, appeared, in, various, forms, in, religions, across, the, world, ancient, egypt, had, sobek, the, crocodile, headed, god, with, his, cult, city, crocodilopolis, as, well, as, taweret, the, goddess, of, childbirth, and, fertility, with, the, back, and, tail, of, a, crocodile, the, jukun, shrine, in, the, wukari, federation, nigeria, is, dedicated, to, crocodiles, in, thanks, for, their, aid, during, migration, in, madagascar, various, peoples, such, as, the, sakalava, and, antandroy, see, crocodiles, as, ancestor, spirits, and, under, local, fady, often, offer, them, food, in, the, case, of, the, latter, at, least, a, crocodile, features, prominently, as, an, ancestor, deity, crocodiles, appear, in, different, forms, in, hinduism, varuna, a, vedic, and, hindu, god, rides, a, part, crocodile, makara, his, consort, varuni, rides, a, crocodile, similarly, the, goddess, personifications, of, the, ganga, and, yamuna, rivers, are, often, depicted, as, riding, crocodiles, also, in, india, in, goa, crocodile, worship, is, practised, including, the, annual, mannge, thapnee, ceremony, sikh, warriors, known, as, nihang, also, have, connections, with, crocodiles, nihang, may, come, from, the, persian, word, for, a, mythical, sea, creature, persian, the, term, owes, its, origin, to, mughal, historians, who, compared, the, ferocity, of, the, akali, with, that, of, crocodiles, the, meaning, of, akali, in, sikhism, however, is, the, immortal, army, of, akal, god, in, latin, america, cipactli, was, the, giant, earth, crocodile, of, the, aztec, and, other, nahua, peoples, the, name, of, surabaya, indonesia, is, locally, believed, to, be, derived, from, the, words, suro, shark, and, boyo, crocodile, two, creatures, which, in, a, local, myth, fought, each, other, in, order, to, gain, the, title, of, the, strongest, and, most, powerful, animal, in, the, area, it, was, said, that, the, two, powerful, animals, agreed, for, a, truce, and, set, boundaries, that, the, shark, s, domain, would, be, in, the, sea, while, the, crocodile, s, domain, would, be, on, the, land, however, one, day, the, shark, swam, into, the, river, estuary, to, hunt, this, angered, the, crocodile, who, declared, it, his, territory, the, shark, argued, that, the, river, was, a, water, realm, which, meant, that, it, was, shark, territory, while, the, crocodile, argued, that, the, river, flowed, deep, inland, so, it, was, therefore, crocodile, territory, a, ferocious, fight, resumed, as, the, two, animals, bit, each, other, finally, the, shark, was, badly, bitten, and, fled, to, the, open, sea, and, the, crocodile, finally, ruled, the, estuarine, area, that, today, is, the, city, another, source, alludes, to, a, jayabaya, prophecy, a, 12th, century, psychic, king, of, kediri, kingdom, as, he, foresaw, a, fight, between, a, giant, white, shark, and, a, giant, white, crocodile, taking, place, in, the, area, which, is, sometimes, interpreted, as, a,
