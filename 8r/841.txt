the, chimpanzee, t, m, p, n, z, i, pan, troglodytes, also, simply, known, as, the, chimp, is, a, species, of, great, ape, native, to, the, forests, and, savannahs, of, tropical, africa, it, has, four, confirmed, subspecies, and, a, fifth, proposed, one, when, its, close, relative, the, bonobo, was, more, commonly, known, as, the, pygmy, chimpanzee, this, species, was, often, called, the, common, chimpanzee, or, the, robust, chimpanzee, the, chimpanzee, and, the, bonobo, are, the, only, species, in, the, genus, pan, evidence, from, fossils, and, dna, sequencing, shows, that, pan, is, a, sister, taxon, to, the, human, lineage, and, is, thus, humans, closest, living, relative, the, chimpanzee, is, covered, in, coarse, black, hair, but, has, a, bare, face, fingers, toes, palms, of, the, hands, and, soles, of, the, feet, it, is, larger, and, more, robust, than, the, bonobo, weighing, 40, 70, kg, 88, 154, lb, for, males, and, 27, 50, kg, 60, 110, lb, for, females, and, standing, 150, cm, 4, ft, 11, in, the, chimpanzee, lives, in, groups, that, range, in, size, from, 15, to, 150, members, although, individuals, travel, and, forage, in, much, smaller, groups, during, the, day, the, species, lives, in, a, strict, male, dominated, hierarchy, where, disputes, are, generally, settled, without, the, need, for, violence, nearly, all, chimpanzee, populations, have, been, recorded, using, tools, modifying, sticks, rocks, grass, and, leaves, and, using, them, for, hunting, and, acquiring, honey, termites, ants, nuts, and, water, the, species, has, also, been, found, creating, sharpened, sticks, to, spear, small, mammals, its, gestation, period, is, eight, months, the, infant, is, weaned, at, about, three, years, old, but, usually, maintains, a, close, relationship, with, its, mother, for, several, years, more, the, chimpanzee, is, listed, on, the, iucn, red, list, as, an, endangered, species, between, 170, 000, and, 300, 000, individuals, are, estimated, across, its, range, the, biggest, threats, to, the, chimpanzee, are, habitat, loss, poaching, and, disease, chimpanzees, appear, in, western, popular, culture, as, stereotyped, clown, figures, and, have, featured, in, entertainments, such, as, chimpanzees, tea, parties, circus, acts, and, stage, shows, although, chimpanzees, have, been, kept, as, pets, their, strength, aggressiveness, and, unpredictability, makes, them, dangerous, in, this, role, some, hundreds, have, been, kept, in, laboratories, for, research, especially, in, the, united, states, many, attempts, have, been, made, to, teach, languages, such, as, american, sign, language, to, chimpanzees, with, limited, success, the, english, word, chimpanzee, is, first, recorded, in, 1738, it, is, derived, from, vili, ci, mpenze, or, tshiluba, language, chimpenze, with, a, meaning, of, ape, or, mockman, the, colloquialism, chimp, was, most, likely, coined, some, time, in, the, late, 1870s, the, genus, name, pan, derives, from, the, greek, god, while, the, specific, name, troglodytes, was, taken, from, the, troglodytae, a, mythical, race, of, cave, dwellers, the, first, great, ape, known, to, western, science, in, the, 17th, century, was, the, orang, outang, genus, pongo, the, local, malay, name, being, recorded, in, java, by, the, dutch, physician, jacobus, bontius, in, 1641, the, dutch, anatomist, nicolaes, tulp, applied, the, name, to, a, chimpanzee, or, bonobo, brought, to, the, netherlands, from, angola, another, dutch, anatomist, peter, camper, dissected, specimens, from, central, africa, and, southeast, asia, in, the, 1770s, noting, the, differences, between, the, african, and, asian, apes, the, german, naturalist, johann, friedrich, blumenbach, classified, the, chimpanzee, as, simia, troglodytes, by, 1775, another, german, naturalist, lorenz, oken, coined, the, genus, pan, in, 1816, the, bonobo, was, recognised, as, distinct, from, the, chimpanzee, by, 1933, despite, a, large, number, of, homo, fossil, finds, pan, fossils, were, not, described, until, 2005, existing, chimpanzee, populations, in, west, and, central, africa, do, not, overlap, with, the, major, human, fossil, sites, in, east, africa, but, chimpanzee, fossils, have, now, been, reported, from, kenya, this, indicates, that, both, humans, and, members, of, the, pan, clade, were, present, in, the, east, african, rift, valley, during, the, middle, pleistocene, according, to, studies, published, in, 2017, by, researchers, at, george, washington, university, bonobos, along, with, chimpanzees, split, from, the, human, line, about, 8, million, years, ago, then, bonobos, split, from, the, common, chimpanzee, line, about, 2, million, years, ago, another, 2017, genetic, study, suggests, ancient, gene, flow, introgression, between, 200, 000, and, 550, 000, years, ago, from, the, bonobo, into, the, ancestors, of, central, and, eastern, chimpanzees, four, subspecies, of, the, chimpanzee, have, been, recognised, with, the, possibility, of, a, fifth, a, draft, version, of, the, chimpanzee, genome, was, published, in, 2005, and, encodes, 18, 759, proteins, compared, to, 20, 383, in, the, human, proteome, the, dna, sequences, of, humans, and, chimpanzees, are, very, similar, and, the, difference, in, protein, number, mostly, arises, from, incomplete, sequences, in, the, chimpanzee, genome, both, species, differ, by, about, 35, million, single, nucleotide, changes, five, million, insertion, deletion, events, and, various, chromosomal, rearrangements, typical, human, and, chimpanzee, protein, homologs, differ, in, an, average, of, only, two, amino, acids, about, 30, of, all, human, proteins, are, identical, in, sequence, to, the, corresponding, chimpanzee, protein, duplications, of, small, parts, of, chromosomes, have, been, the, major, source, of, differences, between, human, and, chimpanzee, genetic, material, about, 2, 7, of, the, corresponding, modern, genomes, represent, differences, produced, by, gene, duplications, or, deletions, since, humans, and, chimpanzees, diverged, from, their, common, evolutionary, ancestor, adult, chimpanzees, have, an, average, standing, height, of, 150, cm, 4, ft, 11, in, wild, adult, males, weigh, between, 40, and, 70, kg, 88, and, 154, lb, and, females, weigh, between, 27, and, 50, kg, 60, and, 110, lb, in, exceptional, cases, certain, individuals, may, considerably, exceed, these, measurements, standing, over, 168, cm, 5, ft, 6, in, on, two, legs, and, weighing, up, to, 136, kg, 300, lb, in, captivity, the, chimpanzee, is, more, robustly, built, than, the, bonobo, but, less, than, the, gorilla, the, arms, of, a, chimpanzee, are, longer, than, its, legs, and, can, reach, below, the, knees, the, hands, have, long, fingers, with, short, thumbs, and, flat, fingernails, the, feet, are, adapted, for, grasping, and, the, big, toe, is, opposable, the, pelvis, is, long, with, an, extended, ilium, a, chimpanzee, s, head, is, rounded, with, a, prominent, and, prognathous, face, and, a, pronounced, brow, ridge, it, has, forward, facing, eyes, a, small, nose, rounded, non, lobed, ears, and, a, long, mobile, upper, lip, additionally, adult, males, have, sharp, canine, teeth, like, all, great, apes, it, has, a, dental, formula, of, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, that, is, two, incisors, one, canine, two, premolars, and, three, molars, on, both, halves, of, each, jaw, chimpanzees, lack, the, prominent, sagittal, crest, and, associated, head, and, neck, musculature, of, gorillas, chimpanzee, bodies, are, covered, by, coarse, hair, except, for, the, face, fingers, toes, palms, of, the, hands, and, soles, of, the, feet, chimpanzees, lose, more, hair, as, they, age, and, develop, bald, spots, the, hair, of, a, chimpanzee, is, typically, black, but, can, be, brown, or, ginger, as, they, get, older, white, or, grey, patches, may, appear, particularly, on, the, chin, and, lower, region, chimpanzee, skin, that, is, covered, with, body, hair, is, white, while, exposed, areas, vary, white, which, ages, into, a, dark, muddy, colour, in, eastern, chimpanzees, freckled, on, white, which, ages, to, a, heavily, mottled, muddy, colour, in, central, chimpanzees, and, black, with, a, butterfly, shaped, white, mask, that, darkens, with, age, in, western, chimpanzees, facial, pigmentation, increases, with, age, and, exposure, to, ultraviolet, light, females, develop, swelling, pink, skin, when, in, oestrus, chimpanzees, are, adapted, for, both, arboreal, and, terrestrial, locomotion, arboreal, locomotion, consists, of, vertical, climbing, and, brachiation, on, the, ground, chimpanzees, move, both, quadrupedally, and, bipedally, these, movements, appear, to, have, similar, energy, costs, as, with, bonobos, and, gorillas, chimpanzees, move, quadrupedally, by, knuckle, walking, which, probably, evolved, independently, in, pan, and, gorilla, their, muscles, are, 50, stronger, per, weight, than, those, of, humans, due, to, higher, content, of, fast, twitch, muscle, fibres, one, of, the, chimpanzee, s, adaptations, for, climbing, and, swinging, according, to, japan, s, asahiyama, zoo, the, grip, strength, of, an, adult, chimpanzee, is, estimated, to, be, 200, kg, 440, lb, while, other, sources, claim, figures, of, up, to, 330, kg, 730, lb, the, chimpanzee, is, a, highly, adaptable, species, it, lives, in, a, variety, of, habitats, including, dry, savanna, evergreen, rainforest, montane, forest, swamp, forest, and, dry, woodland, savanna, mosaic, in, gombe, the, chimpanzee, mostly, uses, semideciduous, and, evergreen, forest, as, well, as, open, woodland, at, bossou, the, chimpanzee, inhabits, multistage, secondary, deciduous, forest, which, has, grown, after, shifting, cultivation, as, well, as, primary, forest, and, grassland, at, ta, it, is, found, in, the, last, remaining, tropical, rain, forest, in, ivory, coast, the, chimpanzee, has, an, advanced, cognitive, map, of, its, home, range, and, can, repeatedly, find, food, the, chimpanzee, builds, a, sleeping, nest, in, a, tree, in, a, different, location, each, night, never, using, the, same, nest, more, than, once, chimpanzees, sleep, alone, in, separate, nests, except, for, infants, or, juvenile, chimpanzees, which, sleep, with, their, mothers, the, chimpanzee, is, an, omnivorous, frugivore, it, prefers, fruit, above, all, other, food, but, it, also, eats, leaves, leaf, buds, seeds, blossoms, stems, pith, bark, and, resin, a, study, in, budongo, forest, uganda, found, that, 64, 5, of, their, feeding, time, concentrated, on, fruits, 84, 6, of, which, being, ripe, particularly, those, from, two, species, of, ficus, maesopsis, eminii, and, celtis, gomphophylla, in, addition, 19, of, feeding, time, was, spent, on, arboreal, leaves, mostly, broussonetia, papyrifera, and, celtis, mildbraedii, while, the, chimpanzee, is, mostly, herbivorous, it, does, eat, honey, soil, insects, birds, and, their, eggs, and, small, to, medium, sized, mammals, including, other, primates, insect, species, consumed, include, the, weaver, ant, oecophylla, longinoda, macrotermes, termites, and, honey, bees, the, red, colobus, ranks, at, the, top, of, preferred, mammal, prey, other, mammalian, prey, include, red, tailed, monkeys, infant, and, juvenile, yellow, baboons, bush, babies, blue, duikers, bushbucks, and, common, warthogs, despite, the, fact, that, chimpanzees, are, known, to, hunt, and, to, collect, both, insects, and, other, invertebrates, such, food, actually, makes, up, a, very, small, portion, of, their, diet, from, as, little, as, 2, yearly, to, as, much, as, 65, grams, of, animal, flesh, per, day, for, each, adult, chimpanzee, in, peak, hunting, seasons, this, also, varies, from, troop, to, troop, and, year, to, year, however, in, all, cases, the, majority, of, their, diet, consists, of, fruits, leaves, roots, and, other, plant, matter, female, chimpanzees, appear, to, consume, much, less, animal, flesh, than, males, according, to, several, studies, jane, goodall, documented, many, occasions, within, gombe, stream, national, park, of, chimpanzees, and, western, red, colobus, monkeys, ignoring, each, other, despite, close, proximity, chimpanzees, do, not, appear, to, directly, compete, with, gorillas, in, areas, where, they, overlap, when, fruit, is, abundant, gorilla, and, chimpanzee, diets, converge, but, when, fruit, is, scarce, gorillas, resort, to, vegetation, the, two, apes, may, also, feed, on, different, species, whether, fruit, or, insects, interactions, between, them, can, range, from, friendly, and, even, stable, social, bonding, to, avoidance, to, aggression, and, even, predation, of, infants, on, the, part, of, chimpanzees, the, average, lifespan, of, a, wild, chimpanzee, is, relatively, short, they, usually, live, less, than, 15, years, although, individuals, that, reach, 12, years, may, live, an, additional, 15, years, on, rare, occasions, wild, chimpanzees, may, live, nearly, 60, years, captive, chimpanzees, tend, to, live, longer, than, most, wild, ones, with, median, lifespans, of, 31, 7, years, for, males, and, 38, 7, years, for, females, the, oldest, known, male, captive, chimpanzee, to, have, been, documented, lived, to, 66, years, and, the, oldest, female, little, mama, was, over, 70, years, old, leopards, prey, on, chimpanzees, in, some, areas, it, is, possible, that, much, of, the, mortality, caused, by, leopards, can, be, attributed, to, individuals, that, have, specialised, in, killing, chimpanzees, chimpanzees, may, react, to, a, leopard, s, presence, with, loud, vocalising, branch, shaking, and, throwing, objects, there, is, at, least, one, record, of, chimpanzees, killing, a, leopard, cub, after, mobbing, it, and, its, mother, in, their, den, four, chimpanzees, could, have, fallen, prey, to, lions, at, mahale, mountains, national, park, although, no, other, instances, of, lion, predation, on, chimpanzees, have, been, recorded, lions, likely, do, kill, chimpanzees, occasionally, and, the, larger, group, sizes, of, savanna, chimpanzees, may, have, developed, as, a, response, to, threats, from, these, big, cats, chimpanzees, may, react, to, lions, by, fleeing, up, trees, vocalising, or, hiding, in, silence, chimpanzees, and, humans, share, only, 50, of, their, parasite, and, microbe, species, this, is, due, to, the, differences, in, environmental, and, dietary, adaptations, human, internal, parasite, species, overlap, more, with, omnivorous, savanna, dwelling, baboons, the, chimpanzee, is, host, to, the, louse, species, pediculus, schaeffi, a, close, relative, of, p, humanus, which, infests, human, head, and, body, hair, by, contrast, the, human, pubic, louse, pthirus, pubis, is, closely, related, to, pthirus, gorillae, which, infests, gorillas, a, 2017, study, of, gastro, intestinal, parasites, of, wild, chimpanzees, in, degraded, forest, in, uganda, found, nine, species, of, protozoa, five, nematodes, one, cestode, and, one, trematode, the, most, prevalent, species, was, the, protozoan, troglodytella, abrassarti, recent, studies, have, suggested, that, human, observers, influence, chimpanzee, behaviour, one, suggestion, is, that, drones, camera, traps, and, remote, microphones, should, be, used, to, record, and, monitor, chimpanzees, rather, than, direct, human, observation, chimpanzees, live, in, communities, that, typically, range, from, around, 15, to, more, than, 150, members, but, spend, most, of, their, time, traveling, in, small, temporary, groups, consisting, of, a, few, individuals, these, groups, may, consist, of, any, combination, of, age, and, sexes, both, males, and, females, sometimes, travel, alone, this, fission, fusion, society, may, include, groups, of, four, types, all, male, adult, females, and, offspring, adults, of, both, sexes, or, one, female, and, her, offspring, these, smaller, groups, emerge, in, a, variety, of, types, for, a, variety, of, purposes, for, example, an, all, male, troop, may, be, organised, to, hunt, for, meat, while, a, group, consisting, of, lactating, females, serves, to, act, as, a, nursery, group, for, the, young, at, the, core, of, social, structures, are, males, which, patrol, the, territory, protect, group, members, and, search, for, food, males, remain, in, their, natal, communities, while, females, generally, emigrate, at, adolescence, males, in, a, community, are, more, likely, to, be, related, to, one, another, than, females, are, to, each, other, among, males, there, is, generally, a, dominance, hierarchy, and, males, are, dominant, over, females, however, this, unusual, fission, fusion, social, structure, in, which, portions, of, the, parent, group, may, on, a, regular, basis, separate, from, and, then, rejoin, the, rest, is, highly, variable, in, terms, of, which, particular, individual, chimpanzees, congregate, at, a, given, time, this, is, caused, mainly, by, the, large, measure, of, individual, autonomy, that, individuals, have, within, their, fission, fusion, social, groups, as, a, result, individual, chimpanzees, often, forage, for, food, alone, or, in, smaller, groups, as, opposed, to, the, much, larger, parent, group, which, encompasses, all, the, chimpanzees, which, regularly, come, into, contact, with, each, other, and, congregate, into, parties, in, a, particular, area, male, chimpanzees, exist, in, a, linear, dominance, hierarchy, top, ranking, males, tend, to, be, aggressive, even, during, dominance, stability, this, is, probably, due, to, the, chimpanzee, s, fission, fusion, society, with, male, chimpanzees, leaving, groups, and, returning, after, extended, periods, of, time, with, this, a, dominant, male, is, unsure, if, any, political, maneuvering, has, occurred, in, his, absence, and, must, re, establish, his, dominance, thus, a, large, amount, of, aggression, occurs, within, five, to, fifteen, minutes, after, a, reunion, during, these, encounters, displays, of, aggression, are, generally, preferred, over, physical, attacks, males, maintain, and, improve, their, social, ranks, by, forming, coalitions, which, have, been, characterised, as, exploitative, and, based, on, an, individual, s, influence, in, agonistic, interactions, being, in, a, coalition, allows, males, to, dominate, a, third, individual, when, they, could, not, by, themselves, as, politically, apt, chimpanzees, can, exert, power, over, aggressive, interactions, regardless, of, their, rank, coalitions, can, also, give, an, individual, male, the, confidence, to, challenge, a, dominant, or, larger, male, the, more, allies, a, male, has, the, better, his, chance, of, becoming, dominant, however, most, changes, in, hierarchical, rank, are, caused, by, dyadic, interactions, chimpanzee, alliances, can, be, very, fickle, and, one, member, may, suddenly, turn, on, another, if, it, is, to, his, advantage, low, ranking, males, frequently, switch, sides, in, disputes, between, more, dominant, individuals, low, ranking, males, benefit, from, an, unstable, hierarchy, and, often, find, increased, sexual, opportunities, if, a, dispute, or, conflict, occurs, in, addition, conflicts, between, dominant, males, cause, them, to, focus, on, each, other, rather, than, the, lower, ranking, males, social, hierarchies, among, adult, females, tend, to, be, weaker, nevertheless, the, status, of, an, adult, female, may, be, important, for, her, offspring, females, in, ta, have, also, been, recorded, to, form, alliances, while, chimpanzee, social, structure, is, often, referred, to, as, patriarchal, it, is, not, entirely, unheard, of, for, females, to, forge, coalitions, against, males, there, is, also, at, least, one, recorded, case, of, females, securing, a, dominant, position, over, males, in, their, respective, troop, albeit, in, a, captive, environment, social, grooming, appears, to, be, important, in, the, formation, and, maintenance, of, coalitions, it, is, more, common, among, adult, males, than, either, between, adult, females, or, between, males, and, females, chimpanzees, have, been, described, as, highly, territorial, and, will, frequently, kill, other, chimpanzees, although, margaret, power, wrote, in, her, 1991, book, the, egalitarians, that, the, field, studies, from, which, the, aggressive, data, came, gombe, and, mahale, used, artificial, feeding, systems, that, increased, aggression, in, the, chimpanzee, populations, studied, thus, the, behaviour, may, not, reflect, innate, characteristics, of, the, species, as, a, whole, in, the, years, following, her, artificial, feeding, conditions, at, gombe, jane, goodall, described, groups, of, male, chimpanzees, patrolling, the, borders, of, their, territory, brutally, attacking, chimpanzees, that, had, split, off, from, the, gombe, group, a, study, published, in, 2010, found, that, the, chimpanzees, wage, wars, over, territory, not, mates, patrols, from, smaller, groups, are, more, likely, to, avoid, contact, with, their, neighbours, patrols, from, large, groups, even, take, over, a, smaller, group, s, territory, gaining, access, to, more, resources, food, and, females, while, it, was, traditionally, accepted, that, only, female, chimpanzees, immigrate, and, males, remain, in, their, natal, troop, for, life, there, are, confirmed, cases, of, adult, males, safely, integrating, themselves, into, new, communities, among, west, african, chimpanzees, suggesting, they, are, less, territorial, than, other, subspecies, chimpanzees, mate, throughout, the, year, although, the, number, of, females, in, oestrus, varies, seasonally, in, a, group, female, chimpanzees, are, more, likely, to, come, into, oestrus, when, food, is, readily, available, oestrous, females, exhibit, sexual, swellings, chimpanzees, are, promiscuous, during, oestrus, females, mate, with, several, males, in, their, community, while, males, have, large, testicles, for, sperm, competition, other, forms, of, mating, also, exist, a, community, s, dominant, males, sometimes, restrict, reproductive, access, to, females, a, male, and, female, can, form, a, consortship, and, mate, outside, their, community, in, addition, females, sometimes, leave, their, community, and, mate, with, males, from, neighboring, communities, these, alternative, mating, strategies, give, females, more, mating, opportunities, without, losing, the, support, of, the, males, in, their, community, infanticide, has, been, recorded, in, chimpanzee, communities, in, some, areas, and, the, victims, are, often, consumed, male, chimpanzees, practice, infanticide, on, unrelated, young, to, shorten, the, interbirth, intervals, in, the, females, females, sometimes, practice, infanticide, this, may, be, related, to, the, dominance, hierarchy, in, females, or, may, simply, be, pathological, inbreeding, was, studied, in, a, relatively, undisturbed, eastern, bisexual, chimpanzee, community, despite, an, increased, inbreeding, risk, incurred, by, females, who, do, not, disperse, before, reaching, reproductive, age,

an, act, that, is, known, as, drumming, they, also, do, this, when, encountering, individuals, from, other, communities, vocalisations, are, also, important, in, chimpanzee, communication, the, most, common, call, in, adults, is, the, pant, hoot, which, may, signal, social, rank, and, bond, along, with, keeping, groups, together, pant, hoots, are, made, of, four, parts, starting, with, soft, hoos, the, introduction, that, gets, louder, and, louder, the, build, up, and, climax, into, screams, and, sometimes, barks, these, die, down, back, to, soft, hoos, during, the, letdown, phase, as, the, call, ends, grunting, is, made, in, situations, like, feeding, and, greeting, submissive, individuals, make, pant, grunts, towards, their, superiors, whimpering, is, made, by, young, chimpanzees, as, a, form, of, begging, or, when, lost, from, the, group, chimpanzees, use, distance, calls, to, draw, attention, to, danger, food, sources, or, other, community, members, barks, may, be, made, as, short, barks, when, hunting, and, tonal, barks, when, sighting, large, snakes, when, hunting, small, monkeys, such, as, the, red, colobus, chimpanzees, hunt, where, the, forest, canopy, is, interrupted, or, irregular, this, allows, them, to, easily, corner, the, monkeys, when, chasing, them, in, the, appropriate, direction, chimpanzees, may, also, hunt, as, a, coordinated, team, so, that, they, can, corner, their, prey, even, in, a, continuous, canopy, during, an, arboreal, hunt, each, chimpanzee, in, the, hunting, groups, has, a, role, drivers, serve, to, keep, the, prey, running, in, a, certain, direction, and, follow, them, without, attempting, to, make, a, catch, blockers, are, stationed, at, the, bottom, of, the, trees, and, climb, up, to, block, prey, that, takes, off, in, a, different, direction, chasers, move, quickly, and, try, to, make, a, catch, finally, ambushers, hide, and, rush, out, when, a, monkey, nears, while, both, adults, and, infants, are, taken, adult, male, colobus, monkeys, will, attack, the, hunting, chimps, when, caught, and, killed, the, meal, is, distributed, to, all, hunting, party, members, and, even, bystanders, male, chimpanzees, hunt, in, groups, more, than, females, female, chimpanzees, tend, to, hunt, solitarily, if, a, female, chimpanzee, were, to, participate, in, the, hunting, group, and, catch, a, red, colobus, it, would, likely, immediately, be, taken, by, an, adult, male, female, chimpanzees, are, estimated, to, hunt, 10, 15, of, a, community, s, vertebrates, chimpanzees, display, numerous, signs, of, intelligence, from, the, ability, to, remember, symbols, to, cooperation, tool, use, and, varied, language, capabilities, they, are, among, species, that, have, passed, the, mirror, test, suggesting, self, awareness, in, one, study, two, young, chimpanzees, showed, retention, of, mirror, self, recognition, after, one, year, without, access, to, mirrors, chimpanzees, have, been, observed, to, use, insects, to, treat, their, own, wounds, and, those, of, others, they, catch, them, and, apply, them, directly, to, the, injury, chimpanzees, also, display, signs, of, culture, among, groups, with, the, learning, and, transmission, of, variations, in, grooming, tool, use, and, foraging, techniques, leading, to, localized, traditions, a, 30, year, study, at, kyoto, university, s, primate, research, institute, has, shown, that, chimpanzees, are, able, to, learn, to, recognise, the, numbers, 1, to, 9, and, their, values, the, chimpanzees, further, show, an, aptitude, for, eidetic, memory, demonstrated, in, experiments, in, which, the, jumbled, digits, are, flashed, onto, a, computer, screen, for, less, than, a, quarter, of, a, second, one, chimpanzee, ayumu, was, able, to, correctly, and, quickly, point, to, the, positions, where, they, appeared, in, ascending, order, ayumu, performed, better, than, human, adults, who, were, given, the, same, test, in, controlled, experiments, on, cooperation, chimpanzees, show, a, basic, understanding, of, cooperation, and, recruit, the, best, collaborators, in, a, group, setting, with, a, device, that, delivered, food, rewards, only, to, cooperating, chimpanzees, cooperation, first, increased, then, due, to, competitive, behaviour, decreased, before, finally, increasing, to, the, highest, level, through, punishment, and, other, arbitrage, behaviours, great, apes, show, laughter, like, vocalisations, in, response, to, physical, contact, such, as, wrestling, play, chasing, or, tickling, this, is, documented, in, wild, and, captive, chimpanzees, chimpanzee, laughter, is, not, readily, recognisable, to, humans, as, such, because, it, is, generated, by, alternating, inhalations, and, exhalations, that, sound, more, like, breathing, and, panting, instances, in, which, nonhuman, primates, have, expressed, joy, have, been, reported, humans, and, chimpanzees, share, similar, ticklish, areas, of, the, body, such, as, the, armpits, and, belly, the, enjoyment, of, tickling, in, chimpanzees, does, not, diminish, with, age, chimpanzees, have, displayed, different, behaviours, in, response, to, a, dying, or, dead, group, member, when, witnessing, a, sudden, death, the, other, group, members, act, in, frenzy, with, vocalisations, aggressive, displays, and, touching, of, the, corpse, in, one, case, chimpanzees, cared, for, a, dying, elder, then, attended, and, cleaned, the, corpse, afterward, they, avoided, the, spot, where, the, elder, died, and, behaved, in, a, more, subdued, manner, mothers, have, been, reported, to, carry, around, and, groom, their, dead, infants, for, several, days, experimenters, now, and, then, witness, behaviour, that, cannot, be, readily, reconciled, with, chimpanzee, intelligence, or, theory, of, mind, wolfgang, k, hler, for, instance, reported, insightful, behaviour, in, chimpanzees, but, he, likewise, often, observed, that, they, experienced, special, difficulty, in, solving, simple, problems, researchers, also, reported, that, when, faced, with, a, choice, between, two, persons, chimpanzees, were, just, as, likely, to, beg, food, from, a, person, who, could, see, the, begging, gesture, as, from, a, person, who, could, not, thereby, raising, the, possibility, that, chimpanzees, lack, theory, of, mind, nearly, all, chimpanzee, populations, have, been, recorded, using, tools, they, modify, sticks, rocks, grass, and, leaves, and, use, them, when, foraging, for, termites, and, ants, nuts, honey, algae, or, water, despite, the, lack, of, complexity, forethought, and, skill, are, apparent, in, making, these, tools, chimpanzees, have, used, stone, tools, since, at, least, 4, 300, years, ago, a, chimpanzee, from, the, kasakela, chimpanzee, community, was, the, first, nonhuman, animal, reported, making, a, tool, by, modifying, a, twig, to, use, as, an, instrument, for, extracting, termites, from, their, mound, at, ta, chimpanzees, simply, use, their, hands, to, extract, termites, when, foraging, for, honey, chimpanzees, use, modified, short, sticks, to, scoop, the, honey, out, of, the, hive, if, the, bees, are, stingless, for, hives, of, the, dangerous, african, honeybees, chimpanzees, use, longer, and, thinner, sticks, to, extract, the, honey, chimpanzees, also, fish, for, ants, using, the, same, tactic, ant, dipping, is, difficult, and, some, chimpanzees, never, master, it, west, african, chimpanzees, crack, open, hard, nuts, with, stones, or, branches, some, forethought, in, this, activity, is, apparent, as, these, tools, are, not, found, together, or, where, the, nuts, are, collected, nut, cracking, is, also, difficult, and, must, be, learned, chimpanzees, also, use, leaves, as, sponges, or, spoons, to, drink, water, west, african, chimpanzees, in, senegal, were, found, to, sharpen, sticks, with, their, teeth, which, were, then, used, to, spear, senegal, bushbabies, out, of, small, holes, in, trees, an, eastern, chimpanzee, has, been, observed, using, a, modified, branch, as, a, tool, to, capture, a, squirrel, whilst, experimental, studies, on, captive, chimpanzees, have, found, that, many, of, their, species, typical, tool, use, behaviours, can, be, individually, learnt, by, each, chimpanzees, a, 2021, study, on, their, abilities, to, make, and, use, stone, flakes, in, a, similar, way, as, hypothesised, for, early, hominins, did, not, find, this, behaviour, across, two, populations, of, chimpanzees, suggesting, that, this, behaviour, is, outside, the, chimpanzee, species, typical, range, scientists, have, attempted, to, teach, human, language, to, several, species, of, great, ape, one, early, attempt, by, allen, and, beatrix, gardner, in, the, 1960s, involved, spending, 51, months, teaching, american, sign, language, to, a, chimpanzee, named, washoe, the, gardners, reported, that, washoe, learned, 151, signs, and, had, spontaneously, taught, them, to, other, chimpanzees, including, her, adopted, son, loulis, over, a, longer, period, of, time, washoe, was, reported, to, have, learned, over, 350, signs, debate, is, ongoing, among, scientists, such, as, david, premack, about, chimpanzees, ability, to, learn, language, since, the, early, reports, on, washoe, numerous, other, studies, have, been, conducted, with, varying, levels, of, success, one, involved, a, chimpanzee, jokingly, named, nim, chimpsky, in, allusion, to, the, theorist, of, language, noam, chomsky, trained, by, herbert, terrace, of, columbia, university, although, his, initial, reports, were, quite, positive, in, november, 1979, terrace, and, his, team, including, psycholinguist, thomas, bever, re, evaluated, the, videotapes, of, nim, with, his, trainers, analyzing, them, frame, by, frame, for, signs, as, well, as, for, exact, context, what, was, happening, both, before, and, after, nim, s, signs, in, the, reanalysis, terrace, and, bever, concluded, that, nim, s, utterances, could, be, explained, merely, as, prompting, on, the, part, of, the, experimenters, as, well, as, mistakes, in, reporting, the, data, much, of, the, apes, behaviour, is, pure, drill, he, said, language, still, stands, as, an, important, definition, of, the, human, species, in, this, reversal, terrace, now, argued, nim, s, use, of, asl, was, not, like, human, language, acquisition, nim, never, initiated, conversations, himself, rarely, introduced, new, words, and, mostly, imitated, what, the, humans, did, more, importantly, nim, s, word, strings, varied, in, their, ordering, suggesting, that, he, was, incapable, of, syntax, nim, s, sentences, also, did, not, grow, in, length, unlike, human, children, whose, vocabulary, and, sentence, length, show, a, strong, positive, correlation, chimpanzees, are, rarely, represented, in, african, culture, as, people, find, their, resemblance, to, humans, discomforting, the, gio, people, of, liberia, and, the, hemba, people, of, the, congo, make, chimpanzee, masks, gio, masks, are, crude, and, blocky, and, worn, when, teaching, young, people, how, not, to, behave, the, hemba, masks, have, a, smile, that, suggests, drunken, anger, insanity, or, horror, and, are, worn, during, rituals, at, funerals, representing, the, awful, reality, of, death, the, masks, may, also, serve, to, guard, households, and, protect, both, human, and, plant, fertility, stories, have, been, told, of, chimpanzees, kidnapping, and, raping, women, in, western, popular, culture, chimpanzees, have, occasionally, been, stereotyped, as, childlike, companions, sidekicks, or, clowns, they, are, especially, suited, for, the, latter, role, on, account, of, their, prominent, facial, features, long, limbs, and, fast, movements, which, humans, often, find, amusing, accordingly, entertainment, acts, featuring, chimpanzees, dressed, up, as, humans, with, lip, synchronised, human, voices, have, been, traditional, staples, of, circuses,

characters, and, actions, are, rarely, relevant, to, the, plot, depictions, of, chimpanzees, as, individuals, rather, than, stock, characters, and, as, central, rather, than, incidental, to, the,

laboratories, use, chimpanzees, the, yerkes, national, primate, research, center, at, emory, university, in, atlanta, georgia, and, the, southwest, national, primate, center, in, san, antonio, texas, five, hundred, chimpanzees, have, been, retired, from, laboratory, use, in, the, us, and, live, in, animal, sanctuaries, in, the, us, or, canada, a, five, year, moratorium, was, imposed, by, the, us, national, institutes, of, health, in, 1996, because, too, many, chimpanzees, had, been, bred, for, hiv, research, and, it, has, been, extended, annually, since, 2001, with, the, publication, of, the, chimpanzee, genome, plans, to, increase, the, use, of, chimpanzees, in, america, were, reportedly, increasing, in, 2006, some, scientists, arguing, that, the, federal, moratorium, on, breeding, chimpanzees, for, research, should, be, lifted, however, in, 2007, the, nih, made, the, moratorium, permanent, other, researchers, argue, that, chimpanzees, either, should, not, be, used, in, research, or, should, be, treated, differently, for, instance, with, legal, status, as, persons, pascal, gagneux, an, evolutionary, biologist, and, primate, expert, at, the, university, of, california, san, diego, argues, given, chimpanzees, sense, of, self, tool, use, and, genetic, similarity, to, human, beings, studies, using, chimpanzees, should, follow, the, ethical, guidelines, used, for, human, subjects, unable, to, give, consent, a, recent, study, suggests, chimpanzees, which, are, retired, from, labs, exhibit, a, form, of, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, stuart, zola, director, of, the, yerkes, laboratory, disagrees, he, told, national, geographic, i, don, t, think, we, should, make, a, distinction, between, our, obligation, to, treat, humanely, any, species, whether, it, s, a, rat, or, a, monkey, or, a, chimpanzee, no, matter, how, much, we, may, wish, it, chimps, are, not, human, only, one, european, laboratory, the, biomedical, primate, research,

uganda, several, attacks, on, children, have, happened, some, of, them, fatal, some, of, these, attacks, may, have, been, due, to, the, chimpanzees, being, intoxicated, from, alcohol, obtained, from, rural, brewing, operations, and, becoming, aggressive, towards, humans, human, interactions, with, chimpanzees, may, be, especially, dangerous, if, the, chimpanzees, perceive, humans, as, potential, rivals, at, least, six, cases, of, chimpanzees, snatching, and, eating, human, babies, are, documented, a, chimpanzee, s, strength, and, sharp, teeth, mean, that, attacks, even, on, adult, humans, can, cause, severe, injuries, this, was, evident, after, the, attack, and, near, death, of, former, nascar, driver, st, james, davis, who, was, mauled, by, two, escaped, chimpanzees, while, he, and, his, wife, were, celebrating, the, birthday, of, their, former, pet, chimpanzee, another, example, of, chimpanzees, being, aggressive, toward, humans, occurred, in, 2009, in, stamford, connecticut, when, a, 90, kilogram, 200, lb, 13, year, old, pet, chimpanzee, named, travis, attacked, his, owner, s, friend, who, lost, her, hands, eyes, nose, and, part, of, her, maxilla, from, the, attack, two,

threats, to, the, chimpanzee, are, habitat, destruction, poaching, and, disease, chimpanzee, habitats, have, been, limited, by, deforestation, in, both, west, and, central, africa, road, building, has, caused, habitat, degradation, and, fragmentation, of, chimpanzee, populations, and, may, allow, poachers, more, access, to, areas, that, had, not, been, seriously, affected, by, humans, although, deforestation, rates, are, low, in, western, central, africa, selective, logging, may, take, place, outside, national, parks, chimpanzees, are, a, common, target, for, poachers, in, ivory, coast, chimpanzees, make, up, 1, 3, of, bushmeat, sold, in, urban, markets, they, are, also, taken, often, illegally, for, the, pet, trade, and, are, hunted, for, medicinal, purposes, in, some, areas, farmers, sometimes, kill, chimpanzees, that, threaten, their, crops, others, are, unintentionally, maimed, or, killed, by, snares, meant, for, other, animals, infectious, diseases, are, a, main, cause, of, death, for, chimpanzees, they, succumb, to, many, diseases, that, afflict, humans, because, the, two, species, are, so, similar, as, the, human, population, grows, so, does, the, risk, of,
