cannabis, also, known, as, marijuana, or, weed, among, other, names, is, a, non, chemically, uniform, drug, from, the, cannabis, plant, native, to, central, or, south, asia, the, cannabis, plant, has, been, used, as, a, drug, for, both, recreational, and, entheogenic, purposes, and, in, various, traditional, medicines, for, centuries, tetrahydrocannabinol, thc, is, the, main, psychoactive, component, of, cannabis, which, is, one, of, the, 483, known, compounds, in, the, plant, including, at, least, 65, other, cannabinoids, such, as, cannabidiol, cbd, cannabis, can, be, used, by, smoking, vaporizing, within, food, or, as, an, extract, cannabis, has, various, mental, and, physical, effects, which, include, euphoria, altered, states, of, mind, and, sense, of, time, difficulty, concentrating, impaired, short, term, memory, impaired, body, movement, balance, and, fine, psychomotor, control, relaxation, and, an, increase, in, appetite, onset, of, effects, is, felt, within, minutes, when, smoked, but, may, take, up, to, 90, minutes, when, eaten, as, orally, consumed, drugs, must, be, digested, and, absorbed, the, effects, last, for, two, to, six, hours, depending, on, the, amount, used, at, high, doses, mental, effects, can, include, anxiety, delusions, including, ideas, of, reference, hallucinations, panic, paranoia, and, psychosis, there, is, a, strong, relation, between, cannabis, use, and, the, risk, of, psychosis, though, the, direction, of, causality, is, debated, physical, effects, include, increased, heart, rate, difficulty, breathing, nausea, and, behavioral, problems, in, children, whose, mothers, used, cannabis, during, pregnancy, short, term, side, effects, may, also, include, dry, mouth, and, red, eyes, long, term, adverse, effects, may, include, addiction, decreased, mental, ability, in, those, who, started, regular, use, as, adolescents, chronic, coughing, susceptibility, to, respiratory, infections, and, cannabinoid, hyperemesis, syndrome, cannabis, is, mostly, used, recreationally, or, as, a, medicinal, drug, although, it, may, also, be, used, for, spiritual, purposes, in, 2013, between, 128, and, 232, million, people, used, cannabis, 2, 7, to, 4, 9, of, the, global, population, between, the, ages, of, 15, and, 65, it, is, the, most, commonly, used, largely, illegal, drug, in, the, world, with, the, highest, use, among, adults, in, zambia, the, united, states, canada, and, nigeria, since, the, 1970s, the, potency, of, illicit, cannabis, has, increased, with, thc, levels, rising, and, cbd, levels, dropping, cannabis, plants, have, been, grown, since, at, least, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, and, there, is, evidence, of, it, being, smoked, for, its, psychoactive, effects, around, 500, bce, in, the, pamir, mountains, central, asia, since, the, 14th, century, cannabis, has, been, subject, to, legal, restrictions, the, possession, use, and, cultivation, of, cannabis, has, been, illegal, in, most, countries, since, the, 20th, century, in, 2013, uruguay, became, the, first, country, to, legalize, recreational, use, of, cannabis, other, countries, to, do, so, are, canada, georgia, germany, luxembourg, malta, mexico, south, africa, and, thailand, in, the, u, s, the, recreational, use, of, cannabis, is, legalized, in, 24, states, 3, territories, and, the, district, of, columbia, though, the, drug, remains, federally, illegal, in, australia, it, is, legalized, only, in, the, australian, capital, territory, cannabis, is, a, scythian, word, the, ancient, greeks, learned, of, the, use, of, cannabis, by, observing, scythian, funerals, during, which, cannabis, was, consumed, in, akkadian, cannabis, was, known, as, qunubu, the, word, was, adopted, in, to, the, hebrew, as, qaneh, bosem, medical, cannabis, or, medical, marijuana, refers, to, the, use, of, cannabis, to, treat, disease, or, improve, symptoms, however, there, is, no, single, agreed, upon, definition, e, g, cannabinoids, derived, from, cannabis, and, synthetic, cannabinoids, are, also, used, the, rigorous, scientific, study, of, cannabis, as, a, medicine, has, been, hampered, by, production, restrictions, and, by, the, fact, that, it, is, classified, as, an, illegal, drug, by, many, governments, there, is, some, evidence, suggesting, cannabis, can, be, used, to, reduce, nausea, and, vomiting, during, chemotherapy, to, improve, appetite, in, people, with, hiv, aids, or, to, treat, chronic, pain, and, muscle, spasms, evidence, for, its, use, for, other, medical, applications, is, insufficient, for, drawing, conclusions, about, safety, or, efficacy, there, is, evidence, supporting, the, use, of, cannabis, or, its, derivatives, in, the, treatment, of, chemotherapy, induced, nausea, and, vomiting, neuropathic, pain, and, multiple, sclerosis, lower, levels, of, evidence, support, its, use, for, aids, wasting, syndrome, epilepsy, rheumatoid, arthritis, and, glaucoma, the, medical, use, of, cannabis, is, legal, only, in, a, limited, number, of, territories, including, canada, belgium, australia, the, netherlands, new, zealand, spain, and, many, u, s, states, this, usage, generally, requires, a, prescription, and, distribution, is, usually, done, within, a, framework, defined, by, local, laws, according, to, dea, chief, administrative, law, judge, francis, young, cannabis, is, one, of, the, safest, therapeutically, active, substances, known, to, man, being, under, the, effects, of, cannabis, is, usually, referred, to, as, being, high, cannabis, consumption, has, both, psychoactive, and, physiological, effects, the, high, experience, can, vary, widely, based, among, other, things, on, the, user, s, prior, experience, with, cannabis, and, the, type, of, cannabis, consumed, p647, when, smoking, cannabis, a, euphoriant, effect, can, occur, within, minutes, of, smoking, p104, aside, from, a, subjective, change, in, perception, and, mood, the, most, common, short, term, physical, and, neurological, effects, include, increased, heart, rate, increased, appetite, impairment, of, short, term, and, working, memory, and, impairment, of, psychomotor, coordination, additional, desired, effects, from, consuming, cannabis, include, relaxation, a, general, alteration, of, conscious, perception, increased, awareness, of, sensation, increased, libido, and, distortions, in, the, perception, of, time, and, space, at, higher, doses, effects, can, include, altered, body, image, auditory, and, or, visual, illusions, pseudohallucinations, and, ataxia, from, selective, impairment, of, polysynaptic, reflexes, in, some, cases, cannabis, can, lead, to, dissociative, states, such, as, depersonalization, and, derealization, cannabis, has, held, sacred, status, in, several, religions, and, has, served, as, an, entheogen, a, chemical, substance, used, in, religious, shamanic, or, spiritual, contexts, in, the, indian, subcontinent, since, the, vedic, period, the, earliest, known, reports, regarding, the, sacred, status, of, cannabis, in, the, indian, subcontinent, come, from, the, atharva, veda, estimated, to, have, been, composed, sometime, around, 1400, bce, the, hindu, god, shiva, is, described, as, a, cannabis, user, known, as, the, lord, of, bhang, p19, in, modern, culture, the, spiritual, use, of, cannabis, has, been, spread, by, the, disciples, of, the, rastafari, movement, who, use, cannabis, as, a, sacrament, and, as, an, aid, to, meditation, many, different, ways, to, consume, cannabis, involve, heat, to, decarboxylate, thca, into, thc, common, modes, include, in, 2013, between, 128, and, 232, million, people, used, cannabis, 2, 7, to, 4, 9, of, the, global, population, between, the, ages, of, 15, and, 65, cannabis, is, by, far, the, most, widely, used, illicit, substance, with, the, highest, use, among, adults, as, of, 2018, in, zambia, the, united, states, canada, and, nigeria, between, 1973, and, 1978, eleven, states, decriminalized, marijuana, in, 2001, nevada, reduced, marijuana, possession, to, a, misdemeanor, and, since, 2012, several, other, states, have, decriminalized, and, even, legalized, marijuana, in, 2018, surveys, indicated, that, almost, half, of, the, people, in, the, united, states, had, tried, marijuana, 16, had, used, it, in, the, past, year, and, 11, had, used, it, in, the, past, month, in, 2014, surveys, said, daily, marijuana, use, amongst, us, college, students, had, reached, its, highest, level, since, records, began, in, 1980, rising, from, 3, 5, in, 2007, to, 5, 9, in, 2014, and, had, surpassed, daily, cigarette, use, in, the, us, men, are, over, twice, as, likely, to, use, marijuana, as, women, and, 18, 29, year, olds, are, six, times, more, likely, to, use, as, over, 65, year, olds, in, 2015, a, record, 44, of, the, us, population, has, tried, marijuana, in, their, lifetime, an, increase, from, 38, in, 2013, and, 33, in, 1985, marijuana, use, in, the, united, states, is, three, times, above, the, global, average, but, in, line, with, other, western, democracies, forty, four, percent, of, american, 12th, graders, have, tried, the, drug, at, least, once, and, the, typical, age, of, first, use, is, 16, similar, to, the, typical, age, of, first, use, for, alcohol, but, lower, than, the, first, use, age, for, other, illicit, drugs, a, 2022, gallup, poll, concluded, americans, are, smoking, more, marijuana, than, cigarettes, for, the, first, time, acute, negative, effects, may, include, anxiety, and, panic, impaired, attention, and, memory, an, increased, risk, of, psychotic, symptoms, the, inability, to, think, clearly, and, an, increased, risk, of, accidents, cannabis, impairs, a, person, s, driving, ability, and, thc, was, the, illicit, drug, most, frequently, found, in, the, blood, of, drivers, who, have, been, involved, in, vehicle, crashes, those, with, thc, in, their, system, are, from, three, to, seven, times, more, likely, to, be, the, cause, of, the, accident, than, those, who, had, not, used, either, cannabis, or, alcohol, although, its, role, is, not, necessarily, causal, because, thc, stays, in, the, bloodstream, for, days, to, weeks, after, intoxication, some, immediate, undesired, side, effects, include, a, decrease, in, short, term, memory, dry, mouth, impaired, motor, skills, reddening, of, the, eyes, dizziness, feeling, tired, and, vomiting, some, users, may, experience, an, episode, of, acute, psychosis, which, usually, abates, after, six, hours, but, in, rare, instances, heavy, users, may, find, the, symptoms, continuing, for, many, days, legalization, has, increased, the, rates, at, which, children, are, exposed, to, cannabis, particularly, from, edibles, while, the, toxicity, and, lethality, of, thc, in, children, is, not, known, they, are, at, risk, for, encephalopathy, hypotension, respiratory, depression, severe, enough, to, require, ventilation, somnolence, and, coma, there, is, no, clear, evidence, for, a, link, between, cannabis, use, and, deaths, from, cardiovascular, disease, but, a, 2019, review, noted, that, it, may, be, an, under, reported, contributory, factor, or, direct, cause, in, cases, of, sudden, death, due, to, the, strain, it, can, place, on, the, cardiovascular, system, some, deaths, have, also, been, attributed, to, cannabinoid, hyperemesis, syndrome, there, is, an, association, between, cannabis, use, and, suicide, particularly, in, younger, users, a, 16, month, survey, of, oregon, and, alaska, emergency, departments, found, a, report, of, the, death, of, an, adult, who, had, been, admitted, for, acute, cannabis, toxicity, a, 2015, meta, analysis, found, that, although, a, longer, period, of, abstinence, was, associated, with, smaller, magnitudes, of, impairment, both, retrospective, and, prospective, memory, were, impaired, in, cannabis, users, the, authors, concluded, that, some, but, not, all, of, the, deficits, associated, with, cannabis, use, were, reversible, a, 2012, meta, analysis, found, that, deficits, in, most, domains, of, cognition, persisted, beyond, the, acute, period, of, intoxication, but, was, not, evident, in, studies, where, subjects, were, abstinent, for, more, than, 25, days, few, high, quality, studies, have, been, performed, on, the, long, term, effects, of, cannabis, on, cognition, and, the, results, were, generally, inconsistent, furthermore, effect, sizes, of, significant, findings, were, generally, small, one, review, concluded, that, although, most, cognitive, faculties, were, unimpaired, by, cannabis, use, residual, deficits, occurred, in, executive, functions, impairments, in, executive, functioning, are, most, consistently, found, in, older, populations, which, may, reflect, heavier, cannabis, exposure, or, developmental, effects, associated, with, adolescent, cannabis, use, one, review, found, three, prospective, cohort, studies, that, examined, the, relationship, between, self, reported, cannabis, use, and, intelligence, quotient, iq, the, study, following, the, largest, number, of, heavy, cannabis, users, reported, that, iq, declined, between, ages, 7, 13, and, age, 38, poorer, school, performance, and, increased, incidence, of, leaving, school, early, were, both, associated, with, cannabis, use, although, a, causal, relationship, was, not, established, cannabis, users, demonstrated, increased, activity, in, task, related, brain, regions, consistent, with, reduced, processing, efficiency, a, reduced, quality, of, life, is, associated, with, heavy, cannabis, use, although, the, relationship, is, inconsistent, and, weaker, than, for, tobacco, and, other, substances, the, direction, of, cause, and, effect, however, is, unclear, the, long, term, effects, of, cannabis, are, not, clear, there, are, concerns, surrounding, memory, and, cognition, problems, risk, of, addiction, and, the, risk, of, schizophrenia, in, young, people, although, global, abnormalities, in, white, matter, and, grey, matter, are, not, consistently, associated, with, cannabis, use, reduced, hippocampal, volume, is, consistently, found, amygdala, abnormalities, are, sometimes, reported, although, findings, are, inconsistent, cannabis, use, is, associated, with, increased, recruitment, of, task, related, areas, such, as, the, dorsolateral, prefrontal, cortex, which, is, thought, to, reflect, compensatory, activity, due, to, reduced, processing, efficiency, cannabis, use, is, also, associated, with, downregulation, of, cb, 1, receptors, the, magnitude, of, down, regulation, is, associated, with, cumulative, cannabis, exposure, and, is, reversed, after, one, month, of, abstinence, there, is, limited, evidence, that, chronic, cannabis, use, can, reduce, levels, of, glutamate, metabolites, in, the, human, brain, about, 9, of, those, who, experiment, with, marijuana, eventually, become, dependent, according, to, dsm, iv, 1994, criteria, a, 2013, review, estimates, daily, use, is, associated, with, a, 10, 20, rate, of, dependence, the, highest, risk, of, cannabis, dependence, is, found, in, those, with, a, history, of, poor, academic, achievement, deviant, behavior, in, childhood, and, adolescence, rebelliousness, poor, parental, relationships, or, a, parental, history, of, drug, and, alcohol, problems, of, daily, users, about, 50, experience, withdrawal, upon, cessation, of, use, i, e, are, dependent, characterized, by, sleep, problems, irritability, dysphoria, and, craving, cannabis, withdrawal, is, less, severe, than, withdrawal, from, alcohol, according, to, dsm, v, criteria, 9, of, those, who, are, exposed, to, cannabis, develop, cannabis, use, disorder, compared, to, 20, for, cocaine, 23, for, alcohol, and, 68, for, nicotine, cannabis, use, disorder, in, the, dsm, v, involves, a, combination, of, dsm, iv, criteria, for, cannabis, abuse, and, dependence, plus, the, addition, of, craving, without, the, criterion, related, to, legal, troubles, from, a, clinical, perspective, two, significant, school, of, thought, exists, for, psychiatric, conditions, associated, with, cannabis, or, cannabinoids, use, transient, non, persistent, psychotic, reactions, and, longer, lasting, persistent, disorders, that, resemble, schizophrenia, the, former, is, formally, known, as, acute, cannabis, associated, psychotic, symptoms, caps, at, an, epidemiological, level, a, dose, response, relationship, exists, between, cannabis, use, and, increased, risk, of, psychosis, and, earlier, onset, of, psychosis, although, the, epidemiological, association, is, robust, evidence, to, prove, a, causal, relationship, is, lacking, cannabis, may, also, increase, the, risk, of, depression, but, insufficient, research, has, been, performed, to, draw, a, conclusion, cannabis, use, is, associated, with, increased, risk, of, anxiety, disorders, although, causality, has, not, been, established, a, review, in, 2019, found, that, research, was, insufficient, to, determine, the, safety, and, efficacy, of, using, cannabis, to, treat, schizophrenia, psychosis, or, other, mental, disorders, another, found, that, cannabis, during, adolescence, was, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, developing, depression, and, suicidal, behavior, later, in, life, while, finding, no, effect, on, anxiety, heavy, long, term, exposure, to, marijuana, may, have, physical, mental, behavioral, and, social, health, consequences, it, may, be, associated, with, diseases, of, the, liver, particularly, with, co, existing, hepatitis, c, lungs, heart, and, vasculature, a, 2014, review, found, that, while, cannabis, use, may, be, less, harmful, than, alcohol, use, the, recommendation, to, substitute, it, for, problematic, drinking, was, premature, without, further, study, various, surveys, conducted, between, 2015, and, 2019, found, that, many, users, of, cannabis, substitute, it, for, prescription, drugs, including, opioids, alcohol, and, tobacco, most, of, those, who, used, it, in, place, of, alcohol, or, tobacco, either, reduced, or, stopped, their, intake, of, the, latter, substances, cannabinoid, hyperemesis, syndrome, chs, is, a, severe, condition, seen, in, some, chronic, cannabis, users, where, they, have, repeated, bouts, of, uncontrollable, vomiting, for, 24, 48, hours, four, cases, of, death, have, been, reported, as, a, result, of, chs, a, limited, number, of, studies, have, examined, the, effects, of, cannabis, smoking, on, the, respiratory, system, chronic, heavy, marijuana, smoking, is, associated, with, respiratory, infections, coughing, production, of, sputum, wheezing, and, other, symptoms, of, chronic, bronchitis, the, available, evidence, does, not, support, a, causal, relationship, between, cannabis, use, and, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, short, term, use, of, cannabis, is, associated, with, bronchodilation, other, side, effects, of, cannabis, use, include, cannabinoid, hyperemesis, syndrome, chs, a, condition, which, involves, recurrent, nausea, cramping, abdominal, pain, and, vomiting, cannabis, smoke, contains, thousands, of, organic, and, inorganic, chemical, compounds, this, tar, is, chemically, similar, to, that, found, in, tobacco, smoke, and, over, fifty, known, carcinogens, have, been, identified, in, cannabis, smoke, including, nitrosamines, reactive, aldehydes, and, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, including, benz, pyrene, cannabis, smoke, is, also, inhaled, more, deeply, than, tobacco, smoke, as, of, 2015, there, is, no, consensus, regarding, whether, cannabis, smoking, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, cancer, light, and, moderate, use, of, cannabis, is, not, believed, to, increase, risk, of, lung, or, upper, airway, cancer, evidence, for, causing, these, cancers, is, mixed, concerning, heavy, long, term, use, in, general, there, are, far, lower, risks, of, pulmonary, complications, for, regular, cannabis, smokers, when, compared, with, those, of, tobacco, a, 2015, review, found, an, association, between, cannabis, use, and, the, development, of, testicular, germ, cell, tumors, tgcts, particularly, non, seminoma, tgcts, another, 2015, meta, analysis, found, no, association, between, lifetime, cannabis, use, and, risk, of, head, or, neck, cancer, combustion, products, are, not, present, when, using, a, vaporizer, consuming, thc, in, pill, form, or, consuming, cannabis, foods, there, is, concern, that, cannabis, may, contribute, to, cardiovascular, disease, but, as, of, 2018, evidence, of, this, relationship, was, unclear, research, in, these, events, is, complicated, because, cannabis, is, often, used, in, conjunction, with, tobacco, and, drugs, such, as, alcohol, and, cocaine, that, are, known, to, have, cardiovascular, risk, factors, smoking, cannabis, has, also, been, shown, to, increase, the, risk, of, myocardial, infarction, by, 4, 8, times, for, the, 60, minutes, after, consumption, there, is, preliminary, evidence, that, cannabis, interferes, with, the, anticoagulant, properties, of, prescription, drugs, used, for, treating, blood, clots, as, of, 2019, the, mechanisms, for, the, anti, inflammatory, and, possible, pain, relieving, effects, of, cannabis, were, not, defined, and, there, were, no, governmental, regulatory, approvals, or, clinical, practices, for, use, of, cannabis, as, a, drug, emergency, room, er, admissions, associated, with, cannabis, use, rose, significantly, from, 2012, to, 2016, adolescents, from, age, 12, 17, had, the, highest, risk, at, one, colorado, medical, center, following, legalization, approximately, two, percent, of, er, admissions, were, classified, as, cannabis, users, the, symptoms, of, one, quarter, of, these, users, were, partially, attributed, to, cannabis, a, total, of, 2567, out, of, 449, 031, patients, other, drugs, were, sometimes, involved, of, these, cannabis, admissions, one, quarter, were, for, acute, psychiatric, effects, primarily, suicidal, ideation, depression, and, anxiety, an, additional, third, of, the, cases, were, for, gastrointestinal, issues, including, cannabinoid, hyperemesis, syndrome, according, to, the, united, states, department, of, health, and, human, services, there, were, 455, 000, emergency, room, visits, associated, with, cannabis, use, in, 2011, these, statistics, include, visits, in, which, the, patient, was, treated, for, a, condition, induced, by, or, related, to, recent, cannabis, use, the, drug, use, must, be, implicated, in, the, emergency, department, visit, but, does, not, need, to, be, the, direct, cause, of, the, visit, most, of, the, illicit, drug, emergency, room, visits, involved, multiple, drugs, in, 129, 000, cases, cannabis, was, the, only, implicated, drug, thc, is, a, weak, partial, agonist, at, cb, 1, receptors, while, cbd, is, a, cb, 1, receptor, antagonist, the, cb, 1, receptor, is, found, primarily, in, the, brain, as, well, as, in, some, peripheral, tissues, and, the, cb, 2, receptor, is, found, primarily, in, peripheral, tissues, but, is, also, expressed, in, neuroglial, cells, thc, appears, to, alter, mood, and, cognition, through, its, agonist, actions, on, the, cb, 1, receptors, which, inhibit, a, secondary, messenger, system, adenylate, cyclase, in, a, dose, dependent, manner, via, cb, 1, receptor, activation, thc, indirectly, increases, dopamine, release, and, produces, psychotropic, effects, cbd, also, acts, as, an, allosteric, modulator, of, the, and, opioid, receptors, thc, also, potentiates, the, effects, of, the, glycine, receptors, it, is, unknown, if, or, how, these, actions, contribute, to, the, effects, of, cannabis, the, high, lipid, solubility, of, cannabinoids, results, in, their, persisting, in, the, body, for, long, periods, of, time, even, after, a, single, administration, of, thc, detectable, levels, of, thc, can, be, found, in, the, body, for, weeks, or, longer, depending, on, the, amount, administered, and, the, sensitivity, of, the, assessment, method, investigators, have, suggested, that, this, is, an, important, factor, in, marijuana, s, effects, perhaps, because, cannabinoids, may, accumulate, in, the, body, particularly, in, the, lipid, membranes, of, neurons, the, main, psychoactive, component, of, cannabis, is, tetrahydrocannabinol, thc, which, is, formed, via, decarboxylation, of, tetrahydrocannabinolic, acid, thca, from, the, application, of, heat, raw, leaf, is, not, psychoactive, because, the, cannabinoids, are, in, the, form, of, carboxylic, acids, thc, is, one, of, the, 483, known, compounds, in, the, plant, including, at, least, 65, other, cannabinoids, such, as, cannabidiol, cbd, thc, and, its, major, inactive, metabolite, thc, cooh, can, be, measured, in, blood, urine, hair, oral, fluid, or, sweat, using, chromatographic, techniques, as, part, of, a, drug, use, testing, program, or, a, forensic, investigation, of, a, traffic, or, other, criminal, offense, the, concentrations, obtained, from, such, analyses, can, often, be, helpful, in, distinguishing, active, use, from, passive, exposure, elapsed, time, since, use, and, extent, or, duration, of, use, these, tests, cannot, however, distinguish, authorized, cannabis, smoking, for, medical, purposes, from, unauthorized, recreational, smoking, commercial, cannabinoid, immunoassays, often, employed, as, the, initial, screening, method, when, testing, physiological, specimens, for, marijuana, presence, have, different, degrees, of, cross, reactivity, with, thc, and, its, metabolites, urine, contains, predominantly, thc, cooh, while, hair, oral, fluid, and, sweat, contain, primarily, thc, blood, may, contain, both, substances, with, the, relative, amounts, dependent, on, the, recency, and, extent, of, usage, the, duquenois, levine, test, is, commonly, used, as, a, screening, test, in, the, field, but, it, cannot, definitively, confirm, the, presence, of, cannabis, as, a, large, range, of, substances, have, been, shown, to, give, false, positives, researchers, at, john, jay, college, of, criminal, justice, reported, that, dietary, zinc, supplements, can, mask, the, presence, of, thc, and, other, drugs, in, urine, however, a, 2013, study, conducted, by, researchers, at, the, university, of, utah, school, of, medicine, refute, the, possibility, of, self, administered, zinc, producing, false, negative, urine, drug, tests, cbd, is, a, 5, ht, 1a, receptor, agonist, which, is, under, laboratory, research, to, determine, if, it, has, an, anxiolytic, effect, it, is, often, claimed, that, sativa, strains, provide, a, more, stimulating, psychoactive, high, while, indica, strains, are,

potency, of, illicit, cannabis, has, greatly, increased, since, the, 1970s, with, thc, levels, rising, and, cbd, levels, dropping, it, is, unclear, however, whether, the, increase, in, thc, content, has, caused, people, to, consume, more, thc, or, if, users, adjust, based, on, the, potency, of, the, cannabis, it, is, likely, that, the, higher, thc, content, allows, people, to, ingest, less, tar, at, the, same, time, cbd, levels, in, seized, samples, have, lowered, in, part, because, of, the, desire, to, produce, higher, thc, levels, and, because, more, illegal, growers, cultivate, indoors,

the, 20th, century, the, colonial, government, of, mauritius, banned, cannabis, in, 1840, over, concerns, on, its, effect, on, indian, indentured, workers, the, same, occurred, in, singapore, in, 1870, in, the, united, states, the, first, restrictions, on, sale, of, cannabis, came, in, 1906, in, the, district, of, columbia, canada, criminalized, cannabis, in, the, opium, and, narcotic, drug,

was, made, at, an, international, conference, in, the, hague, about, the, international, opium, convention, that, banned, exportation, of, indian, hemp, to, countries, that, had, prohibited, its, use, and, requiring, importing, countries, to, issue, certificates, approving, the, importation, and, stating, that, the, shipment, was, required, exclusively, for, medical, or, scientific, purposes, it, also, required, parties, to, exercise, an, effective, control, of, such, a, nature, as, to, prevent, the, illicit, international, traffic, in, indian, hemp, and, especially, in, the, resin, in, the, united, states, in, 1937, the, marihuana, tax, act, was, passed, and, prohibited, the, production, of, hemp, in, addition, to, cannabis, in, 1972, the, dutch, government, divided, drugs, into, more, and, less, dangerous, categories, with, cannabis, being, in, the, lesser, category, accordingly, possession, of, 30, grams, 1, 1, oz, or, less, was, made, a, misdemeanor, cannabis, has, been, available, for, recreational, use, in, coffee, shops, since, 1976, cannabis, products, are, only, sold, openly, in, certain, local, coffeeshops, and, possession, of, up, to, 5, grams, 0, 18, oz, for, personal, use, is, decriminalized, however, the, police, may, still, confiscate, it, which, often, happens, in, car, checks, near, the, border, other, types, of, sales, and, transportation, are, not, permitted, although, the, general, approach, toward, cannabis, was, lenient, even, before, official, decriminalization, in, uruguay, president, jose, mujica, signed, legislation, to, legalize, recreational, cannabis, in, december, 2013, making, uruguay, the, first, country, in, the, modern, era, to, legalize, cannabis, in, august, 2014, uruguay, legalized, growing, up, to, six, plants, at, home, as, well, as, the, formation, of, growing, clubs, cannabis, social, club, and, a, state, controlled, marijuana, dispensary, regime, as, of, 17, october, 2018, when, recreational, use, of, cannabis, was, legalized, in, canada, dietary, supplements, for, human, use, and, veterinary, health, products, containing, not, more, than, 10, parts, per, million, of, thc, extract, were, approved, for, marketing, nabiximols, as, sativex, is, used, as, a, prescription, drug, in, canada, the, united, nations, world, drug, report, stated, that, cannabis, was, the, world, s, most, widely, produced, trafficked, and, consumed, drug, in, the, world, in, 2010, and, estimated, between, 128, million, and, 238, million, users, globally, in, 2015, cannabis, has, been, one, of, the, most, used, psychoactive, drugs, in, the, world, since, the, late, 20th, century, following, only, tobacco, and, alcohol, in, popularity, according, to, vera, rubin, the, use, of, cannabis, has, been, encompassed, by, two, major, cultural, complexes, over, time, a, continuous, traditional, folk, stream, and, a, more, circumscribed, contemporary, configuration, the, former, involves, both, sacred, and, secular, use, and, is, usually, based, on, small, scale, cultivation, the, use, of, the, plant, for, cordage, clothing, medicine, food, and, a, general, use, as, an, euphoriant, and, symbol, of, fellowship, the, second, stream, of, expansion, of, cannabis, use, encompasses, the, use, of, hemp, for, commercial, manufacturers, utilizing, large, scale, cultivation, primarily, as, a, fiber, for, mercantile, purposes, but, it, is, also, linked, to, the, search, for, psychedelic, experiences, which, can, be, traced, back, to, the, formation, of, the, parisian, club, des, hashischins, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, most, countries, have, enacted, laws, against, the, cultivation, possession, or, transfer, of, cannabis, these, laws, have, had, an, adverse, effect, on, cannabis, cultivation, for, non, recreational, purposes, but, there, are, many, regions, where, handling, of, cannabis, is, legal, or, licensed, many, jurisdictions, have, lessened, the, penalties, for, possession, of, small, quantities, of, cannabis, so, that, it, is, punished, by, confiscation, and, sometimes, a, fine, rather, than, imprisonment, focusing, more, on, those, who, traffic, the, drug, on, the, black, market, in, some, areas, where, cannabis, use, had, been, historically, tolerated, new, restrictions, were, instituted, such, as, the, closing, of, cannabis, coffee, shops, near, the, borders, of, the, netherlands, and, closing, of, coffee, shops, near, secondary, schools, in, the, netherlands, in, copenhagen, denmark, in, 2014, mayor, frank, jensen, discussed, possibilities, for, the, city, to, legalize, cannabis, production, and, commerce, some, jurisdictions, use, free, voluntary, treatment, programs, and, or, mandatory, treatment, programs, for, frequent, known, users, simple, possession, can, carry, long, prison, terms, in, some, countries, particularly, in, east, asia, where, the, sale, of, cannabis, may, lead, to, a, sentence, of, life, in, prison, or, even, execution, political, parties, non, profit, organizations, and, causes, based, on, the, legalization, of, medical, cannabis, and, or, legalizing, the, plant, entirely, with, some, restrictions, have, emerged, in, such, countries, as, china, and, thailand, in, december, 2012, the, u, s, state, of, washington, became, the, first, state, to, officially, legalize, cannabis, in, a, state, law, washington, initiative, 502, but, still, illegal, by, federal, law, with, the, state, of, colorado, following, close, behind, colorado, amendment, 64, on, 1, january, 2013, the, first, cannabis, club, for, private, marijuana, smoking, no, buying, or, selling, however, was, allowed, for, the, first, time, in, colorado, the, california, supreme, court, decided, in, may, 2013, that, local, governments, can, ban, medical, cannabis, dispensaries, despite, a, state, law, in, california, that, permits, the, use, of, cannabis, for, medical, purposes, at, least, 180, cities, across, california, have, enacted, bans, in, recent, years, on, 30, april, 2024, the, united, states, department, of, justice, announced, it, would, move, to, reclassify, cannabis, from, a, schedule, i, to, a, schedule, iii, controlled, substance, in, december, 2013, uruguay, became, the, first, country, to, legalize, growing, sale, and, use, of, cannabis, after, a, long, delay, in, implementing, the, retail, component, of, the, law, in, 2017, sixteen, pharmacies, were, authorized, to, sell, cannabis, commercially, on, 19, june, 2018, the, canadian, senate, passed, a, bill, and, the, prime,

of, india, to, legalize, the, cultivation, of, hemp, for, industrial, purposes, usage, within, the, hindu, and, buddhist, cultures, of, the, indian, subcontinent, is, common, with, many, street, vendors, in, india, openly, selling, products, infused, with, cannabis, and, traditional, medical, practitioners, in, sri, lanka, selling, products, infused, with, cannabis, for, recreational, purposes, and, well, as, for, religious, celebrations, indian, laws, criminalizing, cannabis, date, back, to, the, colonial, period, india, and, sri, lanka, have, allowed, cannabis, to, be, taken, in, the, context, of, traditional, culture, for, recreational, celebratory, purposes, and, also, for, medicinal, purposes, on, 17, october, 2015, australian, health, minister, sussan, ley, presented, a, new, law, that, will, allow, the, cultivation, of, cannabis, for, scientific, research, and, medical, trials, on, patients, on, 17, october, 2018, canada, legalized, cannabis, for, recreational, adult, use, making, it, the, second, country, in, the, world, to, do, so, after, uruguay, and, the, first, g7, nation, this, legalization, comes, with, regulation, similar, to, that, of, alcohol, in, canada, age, restrictions, limiting, home, production, distribution, consumption, areas, and, sale, times, laws, around, use, vary, from, province, to, province, including, age, limits, retail, structure, and, growing, at, home, the, canadian, licensed, producer, system, aims, to, become, the, gold, standard, in, the, world, for, safe, and, secure, cannabis, production, including, provisions, for, a, robust, craft, cannabis, industry, where, many, expect, opportunities, for, experimenting, with, different, strains, as, the, drug, has, increasingly, been, seen, as, a, health, issue, instead, of, criminal, behavior, cannabis, has, also, been, legalized, or, decriminalized, in, czech, republic, colombia, ecuador, portugal, south, africa, and, canada, medical, marijuana, was, legalized, in, mexico, in, mid, 2017, and, legalized, for, recreational, use, in, june, 2021, germany, legalized, cannabis, for, recreational, use, in, april, 2024, as, of, 2022, uruguay, and, canada,

and, the, district, of, columbia, have, legalized, the, recreational, use, of, cannabis, though, the, drug, remains, illegal, at, the, federal, level, laws, vary, from, state, to, state, when, it, comes, to, the, commercial, sale, court, rulings, in, georgia, and, south, africa, have, led, to, the, legalization, of, cannabis, consumption, but, not, legal, sales, a, policy, of, limited, enforcement, has, also, been, adopted, in, many, countries, in, particular, spain, and, the, netherlands, where, the, sale, of, cannabis, is, tolerated, at, licensed, establishments, contrary, to, popular, belief, cannabis, is, not, legal, in, the, netherlands, but, it, has, been, decriminalized, since, the, 1970s, in, 2021, malta, was, the, first, european, union, member, to, legalize, the, use, of, cannabis, for, recreational, purposes, in, estonia, it, is, only, legal, to, sell, cannabis, products, with, a, thc, content, of, less, than, 0, 2, although, products, may, contain, more, cannabidiol, lebanon, has, recently, become, the, first, arab, country, to, legalize, the, plantation, of, cannabis, for, medical, use, penalties, for, illegal, recreational, use, ranges, from, confiscation, or, small, fines, to, jail, time, and, even, death, in, some, countries, citizens, can, be, punished, if, they, have, used, the, drug, in, another, country, including, singapore, and, south, korea, sinsemilla, spanish, for, without, seed, is, the, dried, seedless, i, e, parthenocarpic, infructescences, of, female, cannabis, plants, because, thc, production, drops, off, once, pollination, occurs, the, male, plants, which, produce, little, thc, themselves, are, eliminated, before, they, shed, pollen, to, prevent, pollination, thus, inducing, the, development, of, parthenocarpic, fruits, gathered, in, dense, infructescences, advanced, cultivation, techniques, such, as, hydroponics, cloning, high, intensity, artificial, lighting, and, the, sea, of, green, method, are, frequently, employed, as, a, response, in, part, to, prohibition, enforcement, efforts, that, make, outdoor, cultivation, more, risky, skunk, refers, to, several, named, strains, of, potent, cannabis, grown, through, selective, breeding, and, sometimes, hydroponics, it, is, a, cross, breed, of, cannabis, sativa, and, c, indica, although, other, strains, of, this, mix, exist, in, abundance, skunk, cannabis, potency, ranges, usually, from, 6, to, 15, and, rarely, as, high, as, 20, the, average, thc, level, in, coffee, shops, in, the, netherlands, is, about, 18, 19, the, average, levels, of, thc, in, cannabis, sold, in, the, united, states, rose, dramatically, between, the, 1970s, and, 2000, this, is, disputed, for, various, reasons, and, there, is, little, consensus, as, to, whether, this, is, a, fact, or, an, artifact, of, poor, testing, methodologies, according, to, daniel, forbes, writing, for, slate, com, the, relative, strength, of, modern, strains, are, likely, skewed, because, undue, weight, is, given, to, much, more, expensive, and, potent, but, less, prevalent, samples, some, suggest, that, results, are, skewed, by, older, testing, methods, that, included, low, thc, content, plant, material, such, as, leaves, in, the, samples, which, are, excluded, in, contemporary, tests, others, believe, that, modern, strains, actually, are, significantly, more, potent, than, older, ones, the, main, producing, countries, of, cannabis, are, afghanistan, canada, china, colombia, india, jamaica, lebanon, mexico, morocco, the, netherlands, pakistan, paraguay, spain, thailand, turkey, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, the, price, or, street, value, of, cannabis, varies, widely, depending, on, geographic, area, and, potency, prices, and, overall, markets, have, also, varied, considerably, over, time, after, some, u, s, states, legalized, cannabis, street, prices, began, to, drop, in, colorado, the, price, of, smokable, buds, infructescences, dropped, 40, percent, between, 2014, and, 2019, from, 200, per, ounce, to, 120, per, ounce, 7, per, gram, to, 4, 19, per, gram, the, european, monitoring, centre, for, drugs, and, drug, addiction, reports, that, typical, retail, prices, in, europe, for, cannabis, varied, from, 2, to, 20, per, gram, in, 2008, with, a, majority, of, european, countries, reporting, prices, in, the, range, 4, 10, the, gateway, hypothesis, states, that, cannabis, use, increases, the, probability, of, trying, harder, drugs, the, hypothesis, has, been, hotly, debated, as, it, is, regarded, by, some, as, the, primary, rationale, for, the, united, states, prohibition, on, cannabis, use, a, pew, research, center, poll, found, that, political, opposition, to, marijuana, use, was, significantly, associated, with, concerns, about, the, health, effects, and, whether, legalization, would, increase, cannabis, use, by, children, some, studies, state, that, while, there, is, no, proof, for, the, gateway, hypothesis, young, cannabis, users, should, still, be, considered, as, a, risk, group, for, intervention, programs, other, findings, indicate, that, hard, drug, users, are, likely, to, be, poly, drug, users, and, that, interventions, must, address, the, use, of, multiple, drugs, instead, of, a, single, hard, drug, almost, two, thirds, of, the, poly, drug, users, in, the, 2009, 2010, scottish, crime, and, justice, survey, used, cannabis, the, gateway, effect, may, appear, due, to, social, factors, involved, in, using, any, illegal, drug, because, of, the, illegal, status, of, cannabis, its, consumers, are, likely, to, find, themselves, in, situations, allowing, them, to, acquaint, with, individuals, using, or, selling, other, illegal, drugs, studies, have, shown, that, alcohol, and, tobacco, may, additionally, be, regarded, as, gateway, drugs, however, a, more, parsimonious, explanation, could, be, that, cannabis, is, simply, more, readily, available, and, at, an, earlier, age, than, illegal, hard, drugs, in, turn, alcohol, and, tobacco, are, typically, easier, to, obtain, at, an, earlier, age, than, is, cannabis, though, the, reverse, may, be, true, in, some, areas, thus, leading, to, the, gateway, sequence, in, those, individuals, since, they, are, most, likely, to, experiment, with, any, drug, offered, a, related, alternative, to, the, gateway, hypothesis, is, the, common, liability, to, addiction, cla, theory, it, states, that, some, individuals, are, for, various, reasons, willing, to, try, multiple, recreational, substances, the, gateway, drugs, are, merely, those, that, are, usually, available, at, an, earlier, age, than, the, harder, drugs, researchers, have, noted, in, an, extensive, review, that, it, is, dangerous, to, present, the, sequence, of, events, described, in, gateway, theory, in, causative, terms, as, this, hinders, both, research, and, intervention, in, 2020, the, national, institute, on, drug, abuse, released, a, study, backing, allegations, that, marijuana, is, a, gateway, to, harder, drugs, though, not, for, the, majority, of, marijuana, users, the, national, institute, on, drug, abuse, determined, that, marijuana, use, is, likely, to, precede, use, of, other, licit, and, illicit, substances, and, that, adults, who, reported, marijuana, use, during, the, first, wave, of, the, survey, were, more, likely, than, adults, who, did, not, use, marijuana, to, develop, an, alcohol, use, disorder, within, 3, years, people, who, used, marijuana, and, already, had, an, alcohol, use, disorder, at, the, outset, were, at, greater, risk, of, their, alcohol, use, disorder, worsening, marijuana, use, is, also, linked, to, other, substance, use, disorders, including, nicotine, addiction, it, also, reported, that, these, findings, are, consistent, with, the, idea, of, marijuana, as, a, gateway, drug, however, the, majority, of, people, who, use, marijuana, do, not, go, on, to, use, other, harder, substances, also, cross, sensitization, is, not, unique, to, marijuana, alcohol, and, nicotine, also, prime, the, brain, for, a, heightened, response, to, other, drugs, and, are, like, marijuana, also, typically, used, before, a, person, progresses, to, other, more, harmful, substances, research, on, cannabis, is, challenging, since, the, plant, is, illegal, in, most, countries, research, grade, samples, of, the, drug, are, difficult, to, obtain, for, research, purposes, unless, granted, under, authority, of, national, regulatory, agencies, such, as, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, there, are, also, other, difficulties, in, researching, the, effects, of, cannabis, many, people, who, smoke, cannabis, also, smoke, tobacco, this, causes, confounding, factors, where, questions, arise, as, to, whether, the, tobacco, the, cannabis, or, both, that, have, caused, a, cancer, another, difficulty, researchers, have, is, in, recruiting, people, who, smoke, cannabis, into, studies, because, cannabis, is, an, illegal, drug, in, many, countries, people, may, be, reluctant, to, take, part, in, research, and, if, they, do, agree, to, take, part, they, may, not, say, how, much, cannabis, they, actually, smoke, footnotes, citations
