encephalitis, is, inflammation, of, the, brain, the, severity, can, be, variable, with, symptoms, including, reduction, or, alteration, in, consciousness, headache, fever, confusion, a, stiff, neck, and, vomiting, complications, may, include, seizures, hallucinations, trouble, speaking, memory, problems, and, problems, with, hearing, causes, of, encephalitis, include, viruses, such, as, herpes, simplex, virus, and, rabies, virus, as, well, as, bacteria, fungi, or, parasites, other, causes, include, autoimmune, diseases, and, certain, medications, in, many, cases, the, cause, remains, unknown, risk, factors, include, a, weak, immune, system, diagnosis, is, typically, based, on, symptoms, and, supported, by, blood, tests, medical, imaging, and, analysis, of, cerebrospinal, fluid, certain, types, are, preventable, with, vaccines, treatment, may, include, antiviral, medications, such, as, acyclovir, anticonvulsants, and, corticosteroids, treatment, generally, takes, place, in, hospital, some, people, require, artificial, respiration, once, the, immediate, problem, is, under, control, rehabilitation, may, be, required, in, 2015, encephalitis, was, estimated, to, have, affected, 4, 3, million, people, and, resulted, in, 150, 000, deaths, worldwide, adults, with, encephalitis, present, with, acute, onset, of, fever, headache, confusion, and, sometimes, seizures, younger, children, or, infants, may, present, with, irritability, poor, appetite, and, fever, neurological, examinations, usually, reveal, a, drowsy, or, confused, person, stiff, neck, due, to, the, irritation, of, the, meninges, covering, the, brain, indicates, that, the, patient, has, either, meningitis, or, meningoencephalitis, limbic, encephalitis, refers, to, inflammatory, disease, confined, to, the, limbic, system, of, the, brain, the, clinical, presentation, often, includes, disorientation, disinhibition, memory, loss, seizures, and, behavioral, anomalies, mri, imaging, reveals, t2, hyperintensity, in, the, structures, of, the, medial, temporal, lobes, and, in, some, cases, other, limbic, structures, some, cases, of, limbic, encephalitis, are, of, autoimmune, origin, encephalitis, lethargica, is, identified, by, high, fever, headache, delayed, physical, response, and, lethargy, individuals, can, exhibit, upper, body, weakness, muscular, pains, and, tremors, though, the, cause, of, encephalitis, lethargica, is, not, currently, known, from, 1917, to, 1928, an, epidemic, of, encephalitis, lethargica, occurred, worldwide, in, 30, 40, of, encephalitis, cases, the, etiology, remains, unknown, viral, infections, are, the, usual, cause, of, infectious, encephalitis, viral, encephalitis, can, occur, either, as, a, direct, effect, of, an, acute, infection, or, as, one, of, the, sequelae, of, a, latent, infection, the, majority, of, viral, cases, of, encephalitis, have, an, unknown, cause, however, the, most, common, identifiable, cause, of, viral, encephalitis, is, from, herpes, simplex, infection, other, causes, of, acute, viral, encephalitis, are, rabies, virus, poliovirus, and, measles, virus, additional, possible, viral, causes, are, arboviral, flavivirus, st, louis, encephalitis, west, nile, virus, bunyavirus, la, crosse, strain, arenavirus, lymphocytic, choriomeningitis, virus, reovirus, colorado, tick, virus, and, henipavirus, infections, the, powassan, virus, is, a, rare, cause, of, encephalitis, it, can, be, caused, by, a, bacterial, infection, such, as, bacterial, meningitis, or, may, be, a, complication, of, a, current, infectious, disease, such, as, syphilis, secondary, encephalitis, other, bacterial, pathogens, like, mycoplasma, and, those, causing, rickettsial, disease, cause, inflammation, of, the, meninges, and, consequently, encephalitis, lyme, disease, or, bartonella, henselae, may, also, cause, encephalitis, certain, parasitic, or, protozoal, infestations, such, as, toxoplasmosis, and, malaria, can, also, cause, encephalitis, in, people, with, compromised, immune, systems, the, rare, but, typically, deadly, forms, of, encephalitis, primary, amoebic, meningoencephalitis, and, granulomatous, amoebic, encephalitis, are, caused, by, free, living, amoeba, autoimmune, encephalitis, signs, can, include, catatonia, psychosis, abnormal, movements, and, autonomic, dysregulation, antibody, mediated, anti, n, methyl, d, aspartate, receptor, encephalitis, and, rasmussen, encephalitis, are, examples, of, autoimmune, encephalitis, anti, nmda, receptor, encephalitis, is, the, most, common, autoimmune, form, and, is, accompanied, by, ovarian, teratoma, in, 58, percent, of, affected, women, 18, 45, years, of, age, another, autoimmune, cause, includes, acute, disseminated, encephalitis, a, demyelinating, disease, which, primarily, affects, children, people, should, only, be, diagnosed, with, encephalitis, if, they, have, a, decreased, or, altered, level, of, consciousness, lethargy, or, personality, change, for, at, least, twenty, four, hours, without, any, other, explainable, cause, diagnosing, encephalitis, is, done, via, a, variety, of, tests, vaccination, is, available, against, tick, borne, and, japanese, encephalitis, and, should, be, considered, for, at, risk, individuals, post, infectious, encephalomyelitis, complicating, smallpox, vaccination, is, avoidable, for, all, intents, and, purposes, as, smallpox, is, nearly, eradicated, contraindication, to, pertussis, immunization, should, be, observed, in, patients, with, encephalitis, an, ideal, drug, to, treat, brain, infection, should, be, small, moderately, lipophilic, at, ph, of, 7, 4, low, level, of, plasma, protein, binding, volume, of, distribution, of, litre, per, kg, does, not, have, strong, affinity, towards, binding, with, p, glycoprotein, or, other, efflux, pumps, on, the, surface, of, blood, brain, barrier, some, drugs, such, as, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, linezolid, metronidazole, fluconazole, and, some, fluoroquinolones, have, good, penetration, to, blood, brain, barrier, treatment, which, is, based, on, supportive, care, is, as, follows, pyrimethamine, based, maintenance, therapy, is, often, used, to, treat, toxoplasmic, encephalitis, te, which, is, caused, by, toxoplasma, gondii, and, can, be, life, threatening, for, people, with, weak, immune, systems, the, use, of, highly, active, antiretroviral, therapy, haart, in, conjunction, with, the, established, pyrimethamine, based, maintenance, therapy, decreases, the, chance, of, relapse, in, patients, with, hiv, and, te, from, approximately, 18, to, 11, this, is, a, significant, difference, as, relapse, may, impact, the, severity, and, prognosis, of, disease, and, result, in, an, increase, in, healthcare, expenditure, the, effectiveness, of, intravenous, immunoglobulin, for, the, management, of, childhood, encephalitis, is, unclear, systematic, reviews, have, been, unable, to, draw, firm, conclusions, because, of, a, lack, of, randomised, double, blind, studies, with, sufficient, numbers, of, patients, and, sufficient, follow, up, there, is, the, possibility, of, a, benefit, of, intravenous, immunoglobulin, for, some, forms, of, childhood, encephalitis, on, some, indicators, such, as, length, of, hospital, stay, time, to, stop, spasms, time, to, regain, consciousness, and, time, to, resolution, of, neuropathic, symptoms, and, fever, intravenous, immunoglobulin, for, japanese, encephalitis, appeared, to, have, no, benefit, when, compared, with, placebo, pretend, treatment, identification, of, poor, prognostic, factors, include, cerebral, edema, status, epilepticus, and, thrombocytopenia, in, contrast, a, normal, encephalogram, at, the, early, stages, of, diagnosis, is, associated, with, high, rates, of, survival, the, number, of, new, cases, a, year, of, acute, encephalitis, in, western, countries, is, 7, 4, cases, per, 100, 000, people, per, year, in, tropical, countries, the, incidence, is, 6, 34, per, 100, 000, people, per, year, the, number, of, cases, of, encephalitis, has, not, changed, much, over, time, with, about, 250, 000, cases, a, year, from, 2005, to, 2015, in, the, us, approximately, seven, per, 100, 000, people, were, hospitalized, for, encephalitis, in, the, us, during, this, time, in, 2015, encephalitis, was, estimated, to, have, affected, 4, 3, million, people, and, resulted, in, 150, 000, deaths, worldwide, herpes, simplex, encephalitis, has, an, incidence, of, 2, 4, per, million, of, the, population, per, year, encephalitis, with, meningitis, is, known, as, meningoencephalitis, while, encephalitis, with, involvement, of, the, spinal, cord, is, known, as, encephalomyelitis, the, word, is, from, ancient, greek, enk, phalos, brain, composed, of, en, in, and, kephal, head, and, the, medical, suffix, itis, inflammation, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease
