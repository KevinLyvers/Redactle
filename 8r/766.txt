the, blue, whale, balaenoptera, musculus, is, a, marine, mammal, and, a, baleen, whale, reaching, a, maximum, confirmed, length, of, 29, 9, m, 98, ft, and, weighing, up, to, 199, t, 196, long, tons, 219, short, tons, it, is, the, largest, animal, known, ever, to, have, existed, the, blue, whale, s, long, and, slender, body, can, be, of, various, shades, of, greyish, blue, on, its, upper, surface, and, somewhat, lighter, underneath, four, subspecies, are, recognized, b, m, musculus, in, the, north, atlantic, and, north, pacific, b, m, intermedia, in, the, southern, ocean, b, m, brevicauda, the, pygmy, blue, whale, in, the, indian, ocean, and, south, pacific, ocean, and, b, m, indica, in, the, northern, indian, ocean, there, is, a, population, in, the, waters, off, chile, that, may, constitute, a, fifth, subspecies, in, general, blue, whale, populations, migrate, between, their, summer, feeding, areas, near, the, poles, and, their, winter, breeding, grounds, near, the, tropics, there, is, also, evidence, of, year, round, residencies, and, partial, or, age, sex, based, migration, blue, whales, are, filter, feeders, their, diet, consists, almost, exclusively, of, krill, they, are, generally, solitary, or, gather, in, small, groups, and, have, no, well, defined, social, structure, other, than, mother, calf, bonds, blue, whales, vocalize, with, a, fundamental, frequency, ranging, from, 8, to, 25, hz, their, vocalizations, may, vary, by, region, season, behavior, and, time, of, day, orcas, are, their, only, natural, predators, the, blue, whale, was, abundant, in, nearly, all, the, earth, s, oceans, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, it, was, hunted, almost, to, the, point, of, extinction, by, whalers, until, the, international, whaling, commission, banned, all, blue, whale, hunting, in, 1966, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, has, listed, blue, whales, as, endangered, as, of, 2018, it, continues, to, face, numerous, man, made, threats, such, as, ship, strikes, pollution, ocean, noise, and, climate, change, the, genus, name, balaenoptera, means, winged, whale, while, the, species, name, musculus, could, mean, muscle, or, a, diminutive, form, of, mouse, possibly, a, pun, by, carl, linnaeus, when, he, named, the, species, in, systema, naturae, one, of, the, first, published, descriptions, of, a, blue, whale, comes, from, robert, sibbald, s, phalainologia, nova, after, sibbald, found, a, stranded, whale, in, the, estuary, of, the, firth, of, forth, scotland, in, 1692, the, name, blue, whale, was, derived, from, the, norwegian, bl, hval, coined, by, svend, foyn, shortly, after, he, had, perfected, the, harpoon, gun, the, norwegian, scientist, g, o, sars, adopted, it, as, the, common, name, in, 1874, blue, whales, were, referred, to, as, sibbald, s, rorqual, after, robert, sibbald, who, first, described, the, species, whalers, sometimes, referred, to, them, as, sulphur, bottom, whales, as, the, bellies, of, some, individuals, are, tinged, with, yellow, this, tinge, is, due, to, a, coating, of, huge, numbers, of, diatoms, herman, melville, briefly, refers, to, sulphur, bottom, whales, in, his, novel, moby, dick, minke, whale, b, musculus, blue, whale, b, borealis, sei, whale, eschrichtius, robustus, gray, whale, b, physalus, fin, whale, megaptera, novaeangliae, humpback, whale, blue, whales, are, rorquals, in, the, family, balaenopteridae, a, 2018, analysis, estimates, that, the, balaenopteridae, family, diverged, from, other, families, in, between, 10, 48, and, 4, 98, million, years, ago, during, the, late, miocene, the, earliest, discovered, anatomically, modern, blue, whale, is, a, partial, skull, fossil, from, southern, italy, identified, as, b, cf, musculus, dating, to, the, early, pleistocene, roughly, 1, 5, 1, 25, million, years, ago, the, australian, pygmy, blue, whale, diverged, during, the, last, glacial, maximum, their, more, recent, divergence, has, resulted, in, the, subspecies, having, a, relatively, low, genetic, diversity, and, new, zealand, blue, whales, have, an, even, lower, genetic, diversity, whole, genome, sequencing, suggests, that, blue, whales, are, most, closely, related, to, sei, whales, with, gray, whales, as, a, sister, group, this, study, also, found, significant, gene, flow, between, minke, whales, and, the, ancestors, of, the, blue, and, sei, whale, blue, whales, also, displayed, high, genetic, diversity, blue, whales, are, known, to, interbreed, with, fin, whales, the, earliest, description, of, a, possible, hybrid, between, a, blue, whale, and, a, fin, whale, was, a, 20, m, 66, ft, anomalous, female, whale, with, the, features, of, both, the, blue, and, the, fin, whales, taken, in, the, north, pacific, a, whale, captured, off, northwestern, spain, in, 1984, was, found, to, have, been, the, product, of, a, blue, whale, mother, and, a, fin, whale, father, two, live, blue, fin, whale, hybrids, have, since, been, documented, in, the, gulf, of, st, lawrence, canada, and, in, the, azores, portugal, dna, tests, done, in, iceland, on, a, blue, whale, killed, in, july, 2018, by, the, icelandic, whaling, company, hvalur, hf, found, that, the, whale, was, the, offspring, of, a, male, fin, whale, and, female, blue, whale, however, the, results, are, pending, independent, testing, and, verification, of, the, samples, because, the, international, whaling, commission, classified, blue, whales, as, a, protection, stock, trading, their, meat, is, illegal, and, the, kill, is, an, infraction, that, must, be, reported, blue, fin, hybrids, have, been, detected, from, genetic, analysis, of, whale, meat, samples, taken, from, japanese, markets, blue, fin, whale, hybrids, are, capable, of, being, fertile, molecular, tests, on, a, 21, m, 70, ft, pregnant, female, whale, caught, off, iceland, in, 1986, found, that, it, had, a, blue, whale, mother, and, a, fin, whale, father, while, its, fetus, was, sired, by, a, blue, whale, in, 2024, a, genome, analysis, of, north, atlantic, blue, whales, found, evidence, that, approximately, 3, 5, of, the, blue, whales, genome, was, derived, from, hybridization, with, fin, whales, gene, flow, was, found, to, be, unidirectional, from, fin, whales, to, blue, whales, comparison, with, antarctic, blue, whales, showed, that, this, hybridization, began, after, the, separation, of, the, northern, and, southern, populations, despite, their, smaller, size, fin, whales, have, similar, cruising, and, sprinting, speeds, to, blue, whales, which, would, allow, fin, males, to, complete, courtship, chases, with, blue, females, there, is, a, reference, to, a, humpback, blue, whale, hybrid, in, the, south, pacific, attributed, to, marine, biologist, michael, poole, at, least, four, subspecies, of, blue, whale, are, recognized, some, of, which, are, divided, into, population, stocks, or, management, units, they, have, a, worldwide, distribution, but, are, mostly, absent, from, the, arctic, ocean, and, the, mediterranean, okhotsk, and, bering, sea, blue, whales, off, the, chilean, coast, may, be, a, separate, subspecies, based, on, geographic, separation, genetics, and, unique, song, types, chilean, blue, whales, may, overlap, in, the, eastern, tropical, pacific, with, antarctica, blue, whales, and, eastern, north, pacific, blue, whales, chilean, blue, whales, are, genetically, differentiated, from, antarctica, blue, whales, and, are, unlikely, to, be, interbreeding, however, the, genetic, distinction, is, less, with, the, eastern, north, pacific, blue, whale, and, there, may, be, gene, flow, between, hemispheres, the, blue, whale, is, a, slender, bodied, cetacean, with, a, broad, u, shaped, head, thin, elongated, flippers, a, small, 33, centimeters, 13, in, sickle, shaped, dorsal, fin, located, close, to, the, tail, and, a, large, tail, stock, at, the, root, of, the, wide, and, thin, flukes, the, upper, jaw, is, lined, with, 70, 395, black, baleen, plates, the, throat, region, has, 60, 88, grooves, which, allows, the, skin, to, expand, during, feeding, it, has, two, blowholes, that, can, squirt, 9, 1, 12, 2, meters, 30, 40, ft, up, in, the, air, the, skin, has, a, mottled, grayish, blue, coloration, appearing, blue, underwater, the, mottling, patterns, near, the, dorsal, fin, vary, between, individuals, the, underbelly, has, lighter, pigmentation, and, can, appear, yellowish, due, to, diatoms, in, the, water, which, historically, earned, them, the, nickname, sulphur, bottom, the, male, blue, whale, has, the, largest, penis, in, the, animal, kingdom, at, around, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, long, and, 12, in, 30, cm, wide, the, blue, whale, is, the, largest, animal, known, ever, to, have, existed, some, studies, have, estimated, that, certain, shastasaurid, ichthyosaurs, and, the, ancient, whale, perucetus, could, have, rivalled, the, blue, whale, in, size, with, perucetus, also, being, heavier, than, the, blue, whale, with, a, mean, weight, of, 180, t, 180, long, tons, 200, short, tons, these, estimates, are, based, on, fragmentary, remains, and, the, proposed, size, for, the, latter, has, been, disputed, in, 2024, other, studies, estimate, that, on, land, large, sauropods, like, bruhathkayosaurus, mean, weight, 110, 170, tons, and, maraapunisaurus, mean, weight, 80, 120, tons, would, have, easily, rivalled, the, blue, whale, with, the, former, even, exceeding, the, blue, whale, based, on, its, most, liberal, estimations, 240, tons, although, these, estimates, are, based, on, even, more, fragmentary, specimens, that, had, disintegrated, by, the, time, those, estimates, were, made, the, international, whaling, commission, iwc, whaling, database, reports, 88, individuals, longer, than, 30, meters, 98, ft, including, one, of, 33, meters, 108, ft, but, problems, with, how, the, measurements, were, taken, suggest, that, any, longer, than, 30, 5, meters, 100, ft, are, suspect, the, discovery, committee, reported, lengths, up, to, 31, meters, 102, ft, the, longest, scientifically, measured, individual, blue, whale, was, 30, meters, 98, ft, from, rostrum, tip, to, tail, notch, female, blue, whales, are, larger, than, males, hydrodynamic, models, suggest, a, blue, whale, could, not, exceed, 33, metres, 108, ft, because, of, metabolic, and, energy, constraints, the, average, length, of, sexually, mature, female, blue, whales, is, 22, 0, meters, 72, 1, ft, for, eastern, north, pacific, blue, whales, 24, meters, 79, ft, for, central, and, western, north, pacific, blue, whales, 21, 24, meters, 68, 78, ft, for, north, atlantic, blue, whales, 25, 4, 26, 3, meters, 83, 4, 86, 3, ft, for, antarctic, blue, whales, 23, 5, meters, 77, 1, ft, for, chilean, blue, whales, and, 21, 3, meters, 69, 9, ft, for, pygmy, blue, whales, in, the, northern, hemisphere, males, weigh, an, average, 100, metric, tons, 220, 000, lb, and, females, 112, metric, tons, 247, 000, lb, eastern,

000, lb, pygmy, blue, whale, males, average, 83, 5, tonnes, 184, 000, lb, to, 99, tonnes, 218, 000, lb, the, weight, of, the, heart, of, a, stranded, north, atlantic, blue, whale, was, 180, kg, 400, lb, the, largest, known, in, any, animal, the, record, holder, blue, whale, was, recorded, at, 173, tonnes, 190, short, tons, with, estimates, of, up, to, 199, tonnes, 220, short, tons, in, 2024, motani, and, pyenson, calculated, the, body, mass, of, blue, whales, at, different, lengths, compiling, records, of, their, sizes, from, previous, academic, literatures, and, using, regression, analyses, and, volumetric, analyses, a, 25, metres, 82, ft, long, individual, was, estimated, to, weigh, approximately, 101, 119, tonnes, 111, 131, short, tons, while, a, 30, metres, 98, ft, long, individual, was, estimated, to, weigh, approximately, 184, 205, tonnes, 203, 226, short, tons, considering, that, the, largest, blue, whale, was, indeed, 33, metres, 108, ft, long, they, estimated, that, a, blue, whale, of, such, length, would, have, weighed, approximately, 252, 273, tonnes, 278, 301, short, tons, blue, whales, live, around, 80, 90, years, or, more, scientists, look, at, a, blue, whale, s, earwax, or, ear, plug, to, estimate, its, age, each, year, a, light, and, dark, layer, of, wax, is, laid, corresponding, with, fasting, during, migration, and, feeding, time, each, set, is, thus, an, indicator, of, age, the, oldest, blue, whale, determined, using, this, method, was, 110, years, old, the, maximum, age, of, a, pygmy, blue, whale, determined, this, way, is, 73, years, in, addition, female, blue, whales, develop, scars, or, corpora, albicantia, on, their, ovaries, every, time, they, ovulate, in, a, female, pygmy, blue, whale, one, corpus, albicans, is, formed, on, average, every, 2, 6, years, the, blue, whale, is, usually, solitary, but, can, be, found, in, pairs, when, productivity, is, high, enough, blue, whales, can, be, seen, in, gatherings, of, more, than, 50, individuals, populations, may, go, on, long, migrations, traveling, to, their, summer, feeding, grounds, towards, the, poles, and, then, heading, to, their, winter, breeding, grounds, in, more, equatorial, waters, the, animals, appear, to, use, memory, to, locate, the, best, feeding, areas, there, is, evidence, of, alternative, strategies, such, as, year, round, residency, and, partial, where, only, some, individuals, migrate, or, age, sex, based, migration, some, whales, have, been, recorded, feeding, in, breeding, grounds, the, traveling, speed, for, blue, whales, ranges, 5, 30, kilometers, per, hour, 3, 1, 18, 6, mph, their, massive, size, limits, their, ability, to, breach, the, greatest, dive, depth, reported, from, tagged, blue, whales, was, 315, meters, 1, 033, ft, their, theoretical, aerobic, dive, limit, was, estimated, at, 31, 2, minutes, however, the, longest, dive, measured, was, 15, 2, minutes, the, deepest, confirmed, dive, from, a, pygmy, blue, whale, was, 506, meters, 1, 660, ft, a, blue, whale, s, heart, rate, can, drop, to, 2, beats, per, minute, bpm, at, deep, depths, but, upon, surfacing, can, rise, to, 37, bpm, which, is, close, to, its, peak, heart, rate, the, blue, whale, s, diet, consists, almost, exclusively, of, krill, blue, whales, capture, krill, through, lunge, feeding, they, swim, towards, them, at, high, speeds, as, they, open, their, mouths, up, to, 80, they, may, engulf, 220, metric, tons, 220, long, tons, 240, short, tons, of, water, at, one, time, they, squeeze, the, water, out, through, their, baleen, plates, with, pressure, from, the, throat, pouch, and, tongue, and, swallow, the, remaining, krill, blue, whales, have, been, recorded, making, 180, rolls, during, lunge, feeding, possibly, allowing, them, to, search, the, prey, field, and, find, the, densest, patches, while, pursuing, krill, patches, blue, whales, maximize, their, calorie, intake, by, increasing, the, number, of, lunges, while, selecting, the, thickest, patches, this, provides, them, enough, energy, for, everyday, activities, while, storing, additional, energy, necessary, for, migration, and, reproduction, blue, whales, have, to, engulf, densities, greater, than, 100, krill, m, to, maintain, the, cost, of, lunge, feeding, they, can, consume, 34, 776, 1, 912, 680, kilojoules, 8, 312, 457, 141, kcal, from, one, mouthful, of, krill, which, can, provide, up, to, 240, times, more, energy, than, used, in, a, single, lunge, it, is, estimated, that, an, average, sized, blue, whale, must, consume, 1, 120, 359, kilograms, 2, 469, 791, lb, of, krill, a, day, blue, whales, appear, to, avoid, directly, competing, with, other, baleen, whales, different, whale, species, select, different, feeding, spaces, and, times, as, well, as, different, prey, species, in, the, southern, ocean, baleen, whales, appear, to, feed, on, antarctic, krill, of, different, sizes, which, may, lessen, competition, between, them, blue, whales, generally, reach, sexual, maturity, at, 8, 10, years, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, length, at, which, they, reach, maturity, is, 21, 23, meters, 69, 75, ft, for, females, and, 20, 21, meters, 66, 69, ft, for, males, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, length, of, maturity, is, 23, 24, meters, 75, 79, ft, and, 22, meters, 72, ft, for, females, and, males, respectively, male, pygmy, blue, whales, average, 18, 7, meters, 61, 4, ft, at, sexual, maturity, female, pygmy, blue, whales, are, 21, 0, 21, 7, meters, 68, 9, 71, 2, ft, in, length, and, roughly, 10, years, old, at, the, age, of, sexual, maturity, little, is, known, about, mating, behavior, or, breeding, and, birthing, areas, blue, whales, appear, to, be, polygynous, with, males, competing, for, females, a, male, blue, whale, typically, trails, a, female, and, will, fight, off, potential, rivals, the, species, mates, from, fall, to, winter, pregnant, females, eat, roughly, four, percent, of, their, body, weight, daily, amounting, to, 60, of, their, overall, body, weight, throughout, summer, foraging, periods, gestation, may, last, 10, 12, months, with, calves, being, 6, 7, meters, 20, 23, ft, long, and, weighing, 2, 3, metric, tons, 2, 0, 3, 0, long, tons, 2, 2, 3, 3, short, tons, at, birth, estimates, suggest, that, because, calves, require, 2, 4, kilograms, 4, 4, 8, 8, lb, milk, per, kg, of, mass, gain, blue, whales, likely, produce, 220, kilograms, 490, lb, of, milk, per, day, ranging, from, 110, to, 320, kilograms, 240, to, 710, lb, of, milk, per, day, the, first, video, of, a, calf, thought, to, be, nursing, was, filmed, in, new, zealand, in, 2016, calves, may, be, weaned, when, they, reach, 6, 8, months, old, at, a, length, of, 16, meters, 53, ft, they, gain, roughly, 37, 500, pounds, 17, 000, kg, during, the, weaning, period, interbirth, periods, last, two, to, three, years, they, average, 2, 6, years, in, pygmy, blue, whales, blue, whales, produce, some, of, the, loudest, and, lowest, frequency, vocalizations, in, the, animal, kingdom, and, their, inner, ears, appear, well, adapted, for, detecting, low, frequency, sounds, the, fundamental, frequency, for, blue, whale, vocalizations, ranges, from, 8, to, 25, hz, blue, whale, songs, vary, between, populations, vocalizations, produced, by, the, eastern, north, pacific, population, have, been, well, studied, this, population, produces, pulsed, calls, a, and, tonal, calls, b, upswept, tones, that, precede, type, b, calls, c, and, separate, downswept, tones, d, a, and, b, calls, are, often, produced, in, repeated, co, occurring, sequences, and, sung, only, by, males, suggesting, a, reproductive, function, d, calls, may, have, multiple, functions, they, are, produced, by, both, sexes, during, social, interactions, while, feeding, and, by, males, when, competing, for, mates, blue, whale, calls, recorded, off, sri, lanka, have, a, three, unit, phrase, the, first, unit, is, a, 19, 8, to, 43, 5, hz, pulsive, call, and, is, normally, 17, 9, 5, 2, seconds, long, the, second, unit, is, a, 55, 9, to, 72, 4, hz, fm, upsweep, that, is, 13, 8, 1, 1, seconds, long, the, final, unit, is, 28, 5, 1, 6,

calls, with, a, frequency, of, 80, and, 38, hz, there, is, evidence, that, some, blue, whale, songs, have, temporally, declined, in, tonal, frequency, the, vocalization, of, blue, whales, in, the, eastern, north, pacific, decreased, in, tonal, frequency, by, 31, from, the, early, 1960s, to, the, early, 21st, century, the, frequency, of, pygmy, blue, whales, in, the, antarctic, has, decreased, by, a, few, tenths, of, a, hertz, every, year, starting, in, 2002, it, is, possible, that, as, blue, whale, populations, recover, from, whaling, there, is, increasing, sexual, selection, pressure, i, e, a, lower, frequency, indicates, a, larger, body, size, the, only, known, natural, predator, to, blue, whales, is, the, orca, although, the, rate, of, fatal, attacks, by, orcas, is, unknown,

giardia, and, balantidium, the, global, blue, whale, population, is, estimated, to, be, 5, 000, 15, 000, mature, individuals, and, 10, 000, 25, 000, total, as, of, 2018, by, comparison, there, were, at, least, 140, 000, mature, whales, in, 1926, there, are, an, estimated, total, of, 1, 000, 3, 000, whales, in, the, north, atlantic, 3, 000, 5, 000, in, the, north, pacific, and, 5, 000, 8, 000, in, the, antarctic, there, are, possibly, 1, 000, 3, 000, whales, in, the, eastern, south, pacific, while, the, pygmy, blue, whale, may, number, 2, 000, 5, 000, individuals, blue, whales, have, been, protected, in, areas, of, the, southern, hemisphere, since, 1939, in, 1955, they, were, given, complete, protection, in, the, north, atlantic, under, the, international, convention, for, the, regulation, of, whaling, this, protection, was, extended, to, the, antarctic, in, 1965, and, the, north, pacific, in, 1966, the, protected, status, of, north, atlantic, blue, whales, was, not, recognized, by, iceland, until, 1960, in, the, united, states, the, species, is, protected, under, the, endangered, species, act, blue, whales, are, formally, classified, as, endangered, under, both, the, u, s, endangered, species, act, and, the, iucn, red, list, they, are, also, listed, on, appendix, i, under, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, of, wild, fauna, and, flora, cites, and, the, convention, on, the, conservation, of, migratory, species, of, wild, animals, although, for, some, populations, there, is, not, enough, information, on, current, abundance, trends, e, g, pygmy, blue, whales, others, are, critically, endangered, e, g, antarctic, blue, whales, blue, whales, were, initially, difficult, to, hunt, because, of, their, size, and, speed, this, began, to, change, in, the, mid, 19th, century, with, the, development, of, harpoons, that, can, be, shot, as, projectiles, blue, whale, whaling, peaked, between, 1930, and, 1931, with, 30, 000, animals, taken, harvesting, of, the, species, was, particularly, high, in, the, antarctic, with, 350, 000, 360, 000, whales, taken, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, in, addition, 11, 000, north, atlantic, whales, mostly, around, iceland, and, 9, 500, north, pacific, whales, were, killed, during, the, same, period, the, international, whaling, commission, banned, all, hunting, of, blue, whales, in, 1966, and, gave, them, worldwide, protection, however, the, soviet, union, continued, to, illegally, hunt, blue, whales, and, other, species, up, until, the, 1970s, ship, strikes, are, a, significant, mortality, factor, for, blue, whales, especially, off, the, u, s, west, coast, a, total, of, 17, blue, whales, were, killed, or, suspected, to, have, been, killed, by, ships, between, 1998, and, 2019, off, the, u, s, west, coast, five, deaths, in, 2007, off, california, were, considered, an, unusual, mortality, event, as, defined, under, the, marine, mammal, protection, act, lethal, ship, strikes, are, also, a, problem, in, sri, lankan, waters, where, their, habitat, intersects, with, one, of, the, world, s, most, active, shipping, routes, here, strikes, caused, the, deaths, of, eleven, blue, whales, in, 2010, and, 2012, and, at, least, two, in, 2014, ship, strike, mortality, claimed, the, lives, of, two, blue, whales, off, southern, chile, in, the, 2010s, possible, measures, for, reducing, future, ship, strikes, include, better, predictive, models, of, whale, distribution, changes, in, shipping, lanes, vessel, speed, reductions, and, seasonal, and, dynamic, management, of, shipping, lanes, few, cases, of, blue, whale, entanglement, in, commercial, fishing, gear, have, been, documented, the, first, report, in, the, u, s, occurred, off, california, in, 2015, reportedly, some, type, of, deep, water, trap, pot, fishery, three, more, entanglement, cases, were, reported, in, 2016, in, sri, lanka, a, blue, whale, was, documented, with, a, net, wrapped, through, its, mouth, along, the, sides, of, its, body, and, wound, around, its, tail, increasing, man, made, underwater, noise, impacts, blue, whales, they, may, be, exposed, to, noise, from, commercial, shipping, and, seismic, surveys, as, a, part, of, oil, and, gas, exploration, blue, whales, in, the, southern, california, bight, decreased, calling, in, the, presence, of, mid, frequency, active, mfa, sonar, exposure, to, simulated, mfa, sonar, was, found, to, interrupt, blue, whale, deep, dive, feeding, but, no, changes, in, behavior, were, observed, in, individuals, feeding, at, shallower, depths, the, responses, also, depended, on, the, animal, s, behavioral, state, its, horizontal, distance, from, the, sound, source, and, the, availability, of, prey, the, potential, impacts, of, pollutants, on, blue, whales, is, unknown, however, because, blue, whales, feed, low, on, the, food, chain, there, is, a, lesser, chance, for, bioaccumulation, of, organic, chemical, contaminants, analysis, of, the, earwax, of, a, male, blue, whale, killed, by, a, collision, with, a, ship, off, the, coast, of, california, showed, contaminants, like, pesticides, flame, retardants, and, mercury, reconstructed, persistent, organic, pollutant, pop, profiles, suggested, that, a, substantial, maternal, transfer, occurred, during, gestation, and, or, lactation, male, blue, whales, in, the, gulf, of, st, lawrence, canada, were, found, to, have, higher, concentrations, of, pcbs, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, ddt, metabolites, and, several, other, organochlorine, compounds, relative, to, females, reflecting, maternal, transfer, of, these, persistent, contaminants, from, females, into, young
