of, determining, whether, care, provided, to, the, sick, or, injured, in, antiquity, is, called, nursing, care, in, the, fifth, century, bc, for, example, the, hippocratic, collection, in, places, described, skilled, care, and, observation, of, patients, by, male, attendants, who, may, have, provided, care, now, provided, by, nurses, around, 600, bc, in, india, it, is, recorded, in, sushruta,

by, one, who, is, not, well, versed, in, anatomy, hence, anyone, desirous, of, acquiring, a, thorough, knowledge, of, anatomy, should, prepare, a, dead, body, and, carefully, observe, by, dissecting, it, and, examining, its, different, parts, in, the, middle, ages, members, of, religious, orders, such, as, nuns, and, monks, often, provided, nursing, like, care, examples, exist, in, christian, islamic, buddhist, and, other, traditions, phoebe, mentioned, in, romans, 16, is, described, in, many, sources, as, the, first, visiting, nurse, these, traditions, were, influential, in, the, development, of, the, ethos, of, modern, nursing, its, religious, roots, remain, in, evidence, in, many, countries, one, example, in, the, united, kingdom, is, the, use, of, the, historical, title, sister, to, refer, to, a, senior, nurse, during, the, reformation, protestant, reformers, shut, down, monasteries, and, convents, allowing, a, few, hundred, municipal, hospices, to, remain, in,

nightingale, laid, the, foundations, of, professional, nursing, after, the, crimean, war, in, light, of, a, comprehensive, statistical, study, she, made, of, sanitation, in, india, leading, her, to, emphasize, the, importance, of, sanitation, after, 10, years, of, sanitary, reform, in, 1873, nightingale, reported, that, mortality, among, the, soldiers, in, india, had, declined, from, 69, to, 18, per, 1, 000, 107, nightingale, believed, that, nursing, was, a, social, freedom, and, mission, for, women, she, believed, that, any, educated, woman, could, help, improve, the, care, of, the, ill, her, notes, on, nursing, 1859, was, a, popular, call, to, action, the, nightingale, model, of, nursing, education, led, to, one, of, the, first, schools, of, nursing, to, be, connected, to, a, hospital, and, medical, school, it, spread, widely, in, europe, and, north, america, after, 1870, nightingale, included, five, factors, that, helped, nurses, in, her, time, who, worked, amidst, poor, sanitation, and, little, education, these, factors, included, 1, fresh, air, 2, clean, water, 3, a, working, drainage, system, 4, cleanliness, and, 5, good, light, nightingale, believed, that, a, clean, working, environment, was, important, in, caring, for, patients, in, the, 19th, century, this, theory, was, ideal, for, helping, patients, providing, a, guide, for, nurses, to, alter, the, environment, around, patients, for, the, betterment, of, their, health, nightingale, s, recommendations, built, upon, the, successes, of, jamaican, doctresses, such, as, mary, seacole, who, like, nightingale, served, in, the, crimean, war, seacole, practised, hygiene, and, the, use, of, herbs, in, healing, wounded, soldiers, and, those, suffering, from, diseases, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, crimea, central, america, and, jamaica, her, predecessors, had, great, success, as, healers, in, the, colony, of, jamaica, in, the, 18th, century, and, they, included, seacole, s, mother, mrs, grant, sarah, adams, cubah, cornwallis, and, grace, donne, the, mistress, and, doctress, to, jamaica, s, wealthiest, planter, simon, taylor, other, important, nurses, in, the, development, of, the, profession, include, red, cross, chapters, which, began, appearing, after, the, establishment, of, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, in, 1863, offered, employment, and, professionalization, opportunities, for, nurses, despite, nightingale, s, initial, objections, catholic, orders, such, as, little, sisters, of, the, poor, sisters, of, mercy, sisters, of, st, mary, st, francis, health, services, inc, and, sisters, of, charity, built, hospitals, and, provided, nursing, services, during, this, period, the, modern, deaconess, movement, began, in, germany, in, 1836,

just, as, doctoring, was, a, profession, for, men, with, increasing, expectations, of, workplace, equality, during, the, late, 20th, century, nursing, became, an, officially, gender, neutral, profession, though, in, practice, the, percentage, of, male, nurses, remained, well, below, that, of, female, physicians, in, the, 21st, century, hospital, based, training, became, standard, in, the, us, in, the, early, 1900s, with, an, emphasis, on, practical, experience, the, nightingale, style, school, began, to, disappear, hospitals, and, physicians, saw, women, in, nursing, as, a, source, of, free, inexpensive, labor, exploitation, of, nurses, was, not, uncommon, by, employers, physicians, and, education, providers, many, nurses, saw, active, duty, in, world, war, i, but, the, profession,

under, fire, the, development, of, undergraduate, and, post, graduate, nursing, degrees, came, after, the, war, nursing, research, and, a, desire, for, association, and, organization, led, to, the, formation, of, professional, organizations, and, academic, journals, nursing, became, recognized, as, a, distinct, academic, discipline, initially, tasked, to, define, the, theoretical, basis, for, practice, nurses, are, perceived, to, be, in, short, supply, around, the, world, particularly, in, south, east, asia, and, africa, a, global, survey, by, mckinsey, company, in, 2022, found, that, between, 28, and, 38, of, nurse, respondents, in, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, singapore, japan, and, france, said, they, were, likely, to, leave, their, role, in, direct, patient, care, in, the, next, year, the, top, five, factors, which, they, said, would, make, them, stay, were, pay, ranked, eighth, on, the, list, a, 2023, american, survey, found, that, 30, were, considering, leaving, patient, care, according, to, the, traditional, interpretation, physicians, are, concerned, with, curing, or, treating, medical, conditions, while, nurses, focus, on, care, in, healthcare, settings, this, line, is, often, blurred, complicating, the, task, of, distinguishing, the, professions, although, nursing, practice, varies, both, through, its, various, specialties, and, countries, nursing, organizations, offer, the, following, definitions, nursing, encompasses, autonomous, and, collaborative, care, of, individuals, of, all, ages, families, groups, and, communities, sick, or,

to, assist, the, individual, sick, or, well, in, the, performance, of, those, activities, contributing, to, health, or, its, recovery, or, to, peaceful, death, that, he, would, perform, unaided, if, he, had, the, necessary, strength, will, or, knowledge, the, practice, of, nursing, is, based, upon, a, social, contract, that, delineates, professional, rights, and, responsibilities, as, well, as,

the, nursing, community, worldwide, aims, for, professional, nurses, to, ensure, quality, care, while, maintaining, their, credentials, code, of, ethics, standards, and, competencies, and, continuing, their, education, multiple, educational, paths, lead, to, becoming, a, professional, nurse, these, vary, by, jurisdiction, all, involve, extensive, study, of, nursing, theory, and, practice, as, well, as, training, in, clinical, skills, nurses, provide, care, based, on, the, individual, s, physical, emotional, psychological, intellectual, social, and, spiritual, needs, the, profession, combines,

century, but, the, ru, movement, was, superseded, by, evidence, based, practice, in, the, 1990s, evidence, based, practice, ebp, is, about, using, research, but, unlike, ru, it, allows, for, the, integration, of, research, findings, with, clinical, expertise, and, patient, preferences, the, ebp, movement, had, originated, in, the, field, of, medicine, with, archie, cochrane, publishing,
