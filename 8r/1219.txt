improve, fitness, and, health, or, to, change, appearance, through, slimming, weight, loss, is, the, main, treatment, for, obesity, and, there, is, substantial, evidence, this, can, prevent, progression, from, prediabetes, to, type, 2, diabetes, with, a, 7, 10, weight, loss, and, manage, cardiometabolic, health, for, diabetic, people, with, a, 5, 15, weight, loss, weight, loss, in, individuals, who, are, overweight, or, obese, can, reduce, health, risks, increase, fitness, and, may, delay, the, onset, of, diabetes, it, could, reduce, pain, and, increase, movement, in, people, with, osteoarthritis, of, the, knee, weight, loss, can, lead, to, a, reduction, in, hypertension, high, blood, pressure, however, whether, this, reduces, hypertension, related, harm, is, unclear, weight, loss, is, achieved, by, adopting, a, lifestyle, in, which, fewer, calories, are, consumed, than, are, expended, depression, stress, or, boredom, may, contribute, to, unwanted, weight, gain, or, loss, depending, on, the, individual, and, in, these, cases, individuals, are, advised, to, seek, medical, help, a, 2010, study, found, that, dieters, who, got, a, full, night, s, sleep, lost, more, than, twice, as, much, fat, as, sleep, deprived, dieters, though, hypothesized, that, supplementation, of, vitamin, d, may, help, studies, do, not, support, this, the, majority, of, dieters, regain, weight, over, the, long, term, according, to, the, uk, national, health, service, and, the, dietary, guidelines, for, americans, those, who, achieve, and, manage, a, healthy, weight, do, so, most, successfully, by, being, careful, to, consume, just, enough, calories, to, meet, their, needs, and, being, physically, active, for, weight, loss, to, be, permanent, changes, in, diet, and, lifestyle, must, be, permanent, as, well, there, is, evidence, that, counseling, or, exercise, alone, do, not, result, in, weight, loss, whereas, dieting, alone, results, in, meaningful, long, term, weight, loss, and, a, combination, of, dieting, and, exercise, provides, the, best, results, meal, replacements, orlistat, a, very, low, calorie, diet, and, primary, care, intensive, medical, interventions, can, also, support, meaningful, weight, loss, the, least, intrusive, weight, loss, methods, and, those, most, often, recommended, are, adjustments, to, eating, patterns, and, increased, physical, activity, generally, in, the, form, of, exercise, the, world, health, organization, recommends, that, people, combine, a, reduction, of, processed, foods, high, in, saturated, fats, sugar, and, salt, and, reduced, caloric, intake, with, an, increase, in, physical, activity, both, long, term, exercise, programs, and, anti, obesity, medications, reduce, abdominal, fat, volume, self, monitoring, of, diet, exercise, and, weight, are, beneficial, strategies, for, weight, loss, particularly, early, in, weight, loss, programs, research, indicates, that, those, who, log, their, foods, about, three, times, per, day, and, about, 20, times, per, month, are, more, likely, to, achieve, clinically, significant, weight, loss, permanent, weight, loss, depends, on, maintaining, a, negative, energy, balance, and, not, the, type, of, macronutrients, such, as, carbohydrate, consumed, high, protein, diets, have, shown, greater, efficacy, in, the, short, term, under, 12, months, for, people, eating, ad, libitum, due, to, increased, thermogenesis, and, satiety, however, this, effect, tends, to, dissipate, over, time, increasing, water, intake, can, reduce, weight, by, increasing, thermogenesis, by, reducing, food, intake, and, by, increasing, fat, oxidation, persons, dieting, for, weight, loss, have, demonstrated, the, weight, reducing, effects, of, increased, water, consumption, among, adults, in, the, u, s, there, is, a, significant, association, between, inadequate, hydration, and, obesity, other, methods, of, weight, loss, include, use, of, anti, obesity, drugs, that, decrease, appetite, block, fat, absorption, or, reduce, stomach, volume, obesity, has, been, resistant, to, drug, based, therapies, with, a, 2021, review, stating, that, existing, medications, are, often, delivering, insufficient, efficacy, and, dubious, safety, semaglutide, has, also, become, popular, recently, as, an, aid, in, weight, loss, it, is, particularly, beneficial, for, those, with, type, 2, diabetes, and, obesity, bariatric, surgery, may, be, indicated, in, cases, of, severe, obesity, two, common, bariatric, surgical, procedures, are, gastric, bypass, and, gastric, banding, both, can, be, effective, at, limiting, the, intake, of, food, energy, by, reducing, the, size, of, the, stomach, but, as, with, any, surgical, procedure, both, come, with, their, own, risks, that, should, be, considered, in, consultation, with, a, physician, there, is, a, substantial, market, for, products, which, claim, to, make, weight, loss, easier, quicker, cheaper, more, reliable, or, less, painful, these, include, books, dvds, cds, cremes, lotions, pills, rings, and, earrings, body, wraps, body, belts, and, other, materials, fitness, centers, clinics, personal, coaches, weight, loss, groups, and, food, products, and, supplements, dietary, supplements, though, widely, used, are, not, considered, a, healthy, option, for, weight, loss, and, have, no, clinical, evidence, of, efficacy, herbal, products, have, not, been, shown, to, be, effective, in, 2008, between, us, 33, billion, and, 55, billion, was, spent, annually, in, the, us, on, weight, loss, products, and, services, including, medical, procedures, and, pharmaceuticals, with, weight, loss, centers, taking, between, 6, and, 12, percent, of, total, annual, expenditure, over, 1, 6, billion, per, year, was, spent, on, weight, loss, supplements, about, 70, percent, of, americans, dieting, attempts, are, of, a, self, help, nature, in, western, europe, sales, of, weight, loss, products, excluding, prescription, medications, topped, 1, 25, billion, 900, million, 1, 4, billion, in, 2009, the, scientific, soundness, of, commercial, diets, by, commercial, weight, management, organizations, varies, widely, being, previously, non, evidence, based, so, there, is, only, limited, evidence, supporting, their, use, because, of, high, attrition, rates, commercial, diets, result, in, modest, weight, loss, in, the, long, term, with, similar, results, regardless, of, the, brand, and, similarly, to, non, commercial, diets, and, standard, care, comprehensive, diet, programs, providing, counseling, and, targets, for, calorie, intake, are, more, efficient, than, dieting, without, guidance, self, help, although, the, evidence, is, very, limited, the, national, institute, for, health, and, care, excellence, devised, a, set, of, essential, criteria, to, be, met, by, commercial, weight, management, organizations, to, be, approved, unintentional, weight, loss, may, result, from, loss, of, body, fats, loss, of, body, fluids, muscle, atrophy, or, a, combination, of, these, it, is, generally, regarded, as, a, medical, problem, when, at, least, 10, of, a, person, s, body, weight, has, been, lost, in, six, months, or, 5, in, the, last, month, another, criterion, used, for, assessing, weight, that, is, too, low, is, the, body, mass, index, bmi, however, even, lesser, amounts, of, weight, loss, can, be, a, cause, for, serious, concern, in, a, frail, elderly, person, unintentional, weight, loss, can, occur, because, of, an, inadequately, nutritious, diet, relative, to, a, person, s, energy, needs, generally, called, malnutrition, disease, processes, changes, in, metabolism, hormonal, changes, medications, or, other, treatments, disease, or, treatment, related, dietary, changes, or, reduced, appetite, associated, with, a, disease, or, treatment, can, also, cause, unintentional, weight, loss, poor, nutrient, utilization, can, lead, to, weight, loss, and, can, be, caused, by, fistulae, in, the, gastrointestinal, tract, diarrhea, drug, nutrient, interaction, enzyme, depletion, and, muscle, atrophy, continuing, weight, loss, may, deteriorate, into, wasting, a, vaguely, defined, condition, called, cachexia, cachexia, differs, from, starvation, in, part, because, it, involves, a, systemic, inflammatory, response, it, is, associated, with, poorer, outcomes, in, the, advanced, stages, of, progressive, disease, metabolism, can, change, so, that, they, lose, weight, even, when, they, are, getting, what, is, normally, regarded, as, adequate, nutrition, and, the, body, cannot, compensate, this, leads, to, a, condition, called, anorexia, cachexia, syndrome, acs, and, additional, nutrition, or, supplementation, is, unlikely, to, help, symptoms, of, weight, loss, from, acs, include, severe, weight, loss, from, muscle, rather, than, body, fat, loss, of, appetite, and, feeling, full, after, eating, small, amounts, nausea, anemia, weakness, and, fatigue, serious, weight, loss, may, reduce, quality, of, life, impair, treatment, effectiveness, or, recovery, worsen, disease, processes, and, be, a, risk, factor, for, high, mortality, rates, malnutrition, can, affect, every, function, of, the, human, body, from, the, cells, to, the, most, complex, body, functions, including, malnutrition, can, lead, to, vitamin, and, other, deficiencies, and, to, inactivity, which, in, turn, may, pre, dispose, to, other, problems, such, as, pressure, sores, unintentional, weight, loss, can, be, the, characteristic, leading, to, diagnosis, of, diseases, such, as, cancer, and, type, 1, diabetes, in, the, uk, up, to, 5, of, the, general, population, is, underweight, but, more, than, 10, of, those, with, lung, or, gastrointestinal, diseases, and, who, have, recently, had, surgery, according, to, data, in, the, uk, using, the, malnutrition, universal, screening, tool, must, which, incorporates, unintentional, weight, loss, more, than, 10, of, the, population, over, the, age, of, 65, is, at, risk, of, malnutrition, a, high, proportion, 10, 60, of, hospital, patients, are, also, at, risk, along, with, a, similar, proportion, in, care, homes, disease, related, malnutrition, can, be, considered, in, four, categories, inability, to, eat, can, result, from, diminished, consciousness, or, confusion, or, physical, problems, affecting, the, arm, or, hands, swallowing, or, chewing, eating, restrictions, may, also, be, imposed, as, part, of, treatment, or, investigations, lack, of, food, can, result, from, poverty, difficulty, in, shopping, or, cooking, and, poor, quality, meals, other, losses, conditions, such, as, burns, can, be, associated, with, losses, such, as, skin, exudates, weight, loss, issues, related, to, specific, diseases, include, medical, treatment, can, directly, or, indirectly, cause, weight, loss, impairing, treatment, effectiveness, and, recovery, that, can, lead, to, further, weight, loss, in, a, vicious, cycle, many, patients, will, be, in, pain, and, have, a, loss, of, appetite, after, surgery, part, of, the, body, s, response, to, surgery, is, to, direct, energy, to, wound, healing, which, increases, the, body, s, overall, energy, requirements, surgery, affects, nutritional, status, indirectly, particularly, during, the, recovery, period, as, it, can, interfere, with, wound, healing, and, other, aspects, of, recovery, surgery, directly, affects, nutritional, status, if, a, procedure, permanently, alters, the, digestive, system, enteral, nutrition, tube, feeding, is, often, needed, however, a, policy, of, nil, by, mouth, for, all, gastrointestinal, surgery, has, not, been, shown, to, benefit, with, some, weak, evidence, suggesting, it, might, hinder, recovery, early, post, operative, nutrition, is, a, part, of, enhanced, recovery, after, surgery, protocols, these, protocols, also, include, carbohydrate, loading, in, the, 24, hours, before, surgery, but, earlier, nutritional, interventions, have, not, been, shown, to, have, a, significant, impact, social, conditions, such, as, poverty, social, isolation, and, inability, to, get, or, prepare, preferred, foods, can, cause, unintentional, weight, loss, and, this, may, be, particularly, common, in, older, people, nutrient, intake, can, also, be, affected, by, culture, family, and, belief, systems, ill, fitting, dentures, and, other, dental, or, oral, health, problems, can, also, affect, adequacy, of, nutrition, loss, of, hope, status, or, social, contact, and, spiritual, distress, can, cause, depression, which, may, be, associated, with, reduced, nutrition, as, can, fatigue, some, popular, beliefs, attached, to, weight, loss, have, been, shown, to, either, have, less, effect, on, weight, loss, than, commonly, believed, or, are, actively, unhealthy, according, to, harvard, health, the, idea, of, metabolic, rate, being, the, key, to, weight, is, part, truth, and, part, myth, as, while, metabolism, does, affect, weight, loss, external, forces, such, as, diet, and, exercise, have, an, equal, effect, they, also, commented, that, the, idea, of, changing, one, s, rate, of, metabolism, is, under, debate, diet, plans, in, fitness, magazines, are, also, often, believed, to, be, effective, but, may, actually, be, harmful, by, limiting, the, daily, intake, of, important, calories, and, nutrients, which, can, be, detrimental, depending, on, the, person, and, are, even, capable, of, driving, individuals, away, from, weight, loss, obesity, increases, health, risks, including, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular, disease, high, blood, pressure, and, non, alcoholic, fatty, liver, disease, to, name, a, few, reduction, of, obesity, lowers, those, risks, a, 1,

with, cognitive, performance, improvements, in, overweight, and, obese, individuals
