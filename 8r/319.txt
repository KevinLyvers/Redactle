hibernation, is, a, state, of, minimal, activity, and, metabolic, depression, undergone, by, some, animal, species, hibernation, is, a, seasonal, heterothermy, characterized, by, low, body, temperature, slow, breathing, and, heart, rate, and, low, metabolic, rate, it, is, most, commonly, used, to, pass, through, winter, months, called, overwintering, although, traditionally, reserved, for, deep, hibernators, such, as, rodents, the, term, has, been, redefined, to, include, animals, such, as, bears, and, is, now, applied, based, on, active, metabolic, suppression, rather, than, any, absolute, decline, in, body, temperature, many, experts, believe, that, the, processes, of, daily, torpor, and, hibernation, form, a, continuum, and, utilise, similar, mechanisms, the, equivalent, during, the, summer, months, is, aestivation, hibernation, functions, to, conserve, energy, when, sufficient, food, is, not, available, to, achieve, this, energy, saving, an, endothermic, animal, decreases, its, metabolic, rate, and, thereby, its, body, temperature, hibernation, may, last, days, weeks, or, months, depending, on, the, species, ambient, temperature, time, of, year, and, the, individual, s, body, condition, before, entering, hibernation, animals, need, to, store, enough, energy, to, last, through, the, duration, of, their, dormant, period, possibly, as, long, as, an, entire, winter, larger, species, become, hyperphagic, eating, a, large, amount, of, food, and, storing, the, energy, in, their, bodies, in, the, form, of, fat, deposits, in, many, small, species, food, caching, replaces, eating, and, becoming, fat, some, species, of, mammals, hibernate, while, gestating, young, which, are, born, either, while, the, mother, hibernates, or, shortly, afterwards, for, example, female, black, bears, go, into, hibernation, during, the, winter, months, in, order, to, give, birth, to, their, offspring, the, pregnant, mothers, significantly, increase, their, body, mass, prior, to, hibernation, and, this, increase, is, further, reflected, in, the, weight, of, the, offspring, the, fat, accumulation, enables, them, to, provide, a, sufficiently, warm, and, nurturing, environment, for, their, newborns, during, hibernation, they, subsequently, lose, 15, 27, of, their, pre, hibernation, weight, by, using, their, stored, fats, for, energy, ectothermic, animals, also, undergo, periods, of, metabolic, suppression, and, dormancy, which, in, many, invertebrates, is, referred, to, as, diapause, some, researchers, and, members, of, the, public, use, the, term, brumate, to, describe, winter, dormancy, of, reptiles, but, the, more, general, term, hibernation, is, believed, adequate, to, refer, to, any, winter, dormancy, many, insects, such, as, the, wasp, polistes, exclamans, and, the, beetle, bolitotherus, exhibit, periods, of, dormancy, which, have, often, been, referred, to, as, hibernation, despite, their, ectothermy, botanists, may, use, the, term, seed, hibernation, to, refer, to, a, form, of, seed, dormancy, there, is, a, variety, of, definitions, for, terms, that, describe, hibernation, in, mammals, and, different, mammal, clades, hibernate, differently, the, following, subsections, discuss, the, terms, obligate, and, facultative, hibernation, the, last, two, sections, point, out, in, particular, primates, none, of, whom, were, thought, to, hibernate, until, recently, and, bears, whose, winter, torpor, had, been, contested, as, not, being, true, hibernation, during, the, late, 20th, century, since, it, is, dissimilar, from, hibernation, seen, in, rodents, obligate, hibernators, are, animals, that, spontaneously, and, annually, enter, hibernation, regardless, of, ambient, temperature, and, access, to, food, obligate, hibernators, include, many, species, of, ground, squirrels, other, rodents, mouse, lemurs, european, hedgehogs, and, other, insectivores, monotremes, and, marsupials, these, species, undergo, what, has, been, traditionally, called, hibernation, a, physiological, state, wherein, the, body, temperature, drops, to, near, ambient, temperature, and, heart, and, respiration, rates, slow, drastically, the, typical, winter, season, for, obligate, hibernators, is, characterized, by, periods, of, torpor, interrupted, by, periodic, euthermic, arousals, during, which, body, temperatures, and, heart, rates, are, restored, to, more, typical, levels, the, cause, and, purpose, of, these, arousals, are, still, not, clear, the, question, of, why, hibernators, may, return, periodically, to, normal, body, temperatures, has, plagued, researchers, for, decades, and, while, there, is, still, no, clear, cut, explanation, there, are, multiple, hypotheses, on, the, topic, one, favored, hypothesis, is, that, hibernators, build, a, sleep, debt, during, hibernation, and, so, must, occasionally, warm, up, to, sleep, this, has, been, supported, by, evidence, in, the, arctic, ground, squirrel, other, theories, postulate, that, brief, periods, of, high, body, temperature, during, hibernation, allow, the, animal, to, restore, its, available, energy, sources, or, to, initiate, an, immune, response, hibernating, arctic, ground, squirrels, may, exhibit, abdominal, temperatures, as, low, as, 2, 9, c, 26, 8, f, maintaining, sub, zero, abdominal, temperatures, for, more, than, three, weeks, at, a, time, although, the, temperatures, at, the, head, and, neck, remain, at, 0, c, 32, f, or, above, facultative, hibernators, enter, hibernation, only, when, either, cold, stressed, food, deprived, or, both, unlike, obligate, hibernators, who, enter, hibernation, based, on, seasonal, timing, cues, rather, than, as, a, response, to, stressors, from, the, environment, a, good, example, of, the, differences, between, these, two, types, of, hibernation, can, be, seen, in, prairie, dogs, the, white, tailed, prairie, dog, is, an, obligate, hibernator, while, the, closely, related, black, tailed, prairie, dog, is, a, facultative, hibernator, while, hibernation, has, long, been, studied, in, rodents, namely, ground, squirrels, no, primate, or, tropical, mammal, was, known, to, hibernate, until, the, discovery, of, hibernation, in, the, fat, tailed, dwarf, lemur, of, madagascar, which, hibernates, in, tree, holes, for, seven, months, of, the, year, malagasy, winter, temperatures, sometimes, rise, to, over, 30, c, 86, f, so, hibernation, is, not, exclusively, an, adaptation, to, low, ambient, temperatures, the, hibernation, of, this, lemur, is, strongly, dependent, on, the, thermal, behaviour, of, its, tree, hole, if, the, hole, is, poorly, insulated, the, lemur, s, body, temperature, fluctuates, widely, passively, following, the, ambient, temperature, if, well, insulated, the, body, temperature, stays, fairly, constant, and, the, animal, undergoes, regular, spells, of, arousal, dausmann, found, that, hypometabolism, in, hibernating, animals, is, not, necessarily, coupled, with, low, body, temperature, historically, it, was, unclear, whether, or, not, bears, truly, hibernate, since, they, experience, only, a, modest, decline, in, body, temperature, 3, 5, c, compared, with, the, much, larger, decreases, often, 32, c, or, more, seen, in, other, hibernators, many, researchers, thought, that, their, deep, sleep, was, not, comparable, with, true, deep, hibernation, but, this, theory, was, refuted, by, research, in, 2011, on, captive, black, bears, and, again, in, 2016, in, a, study, on, brown, bears, hibernating, bears, are, able, to, recycle, their, proteins, and, urine, allowing, them, to, stop, urinating, for, months, and, to, avoid, muscle, atrophy, they, stay, hydrated, with, the, metabolic, fat, that, is, produced, in, sufficient, quantities, to, satisfy, the, water, needs, of, the, bear, they, also, do, not, eat, or, drink, while, hibernating, but, live, off, their, stored, fat, despite, long, term, inactivity, and, lack, of, food, intake, hibernating, bears, are, believed, to, maintain, their, bone, mass, and, do, not, suffer, from, osteoporosis, they, also, increase, the, availability, of, certain, essential, amino, acids, in, the, muscle, as, well, as, regulate, the, transcription, of, a, suite, of, genes, that, limit, muscle, wasting, a, study, by, g, edgar, folk, jill, m, hunt, and, mary, a, folk, compared, ekg, of, typical, hibernators, to, three, different, bear, species, with, respect, to, season, activity, and, dormancy, and, found, that, the, reduced, relaxation, qt, interval, of, small, hibernators, was, the, same, for, the, three, bear, species, they, also, found, the, qt, interval, changed, for, both, typical, hibernators, and, the, bears, from, summer, to, winter, this, 1977, study, was, one, of, the, first, evidences, used, to, show, that, bears, are, hibernators, in, a, 2016, study, wildlife, veterinarian, and, associate, professor, at, inland, norway, university, of, applied, sciences, alina, l, evans, researched, 14, brown, bears, over, three, winters, their, movement, heart, rate, heart, rate, variability, body, temperature, physical, activity, ambient, temperature, and, snow, depth, were, measured, to, identify, the, drivers, of, the, start, and, end, of, hibernation, for, bears, this, study, built, the, first, chronology, of, both, ecological, and, physiological, events, from, before, the, start, to, the, end, of, hibernation, in, the, field, this, research, found, that, bears, would, enter, their, den, when, snow, arrived, and, ambient, temperature, dropped, to, 0, c, however, physical, activity, heart, rate, and, body, temperature, started, to, drop, slowly, even, several, weeks, before, this, once, in, their, dens, the, bears, heart, rate, variability, dropped, dramatically, indirectly, suggesting, metabolic, suppression, is, related, to, their, hibernation, two, months, before, the, end, of, hibernation, the, bears, body, temperature, starts, to, rise, unrelated, to, heart, rate, variability, but, rather, driven, by, the, ambient, temperature, the, heart, rate, variability, only, increases, around, three, weeks, before, arousal, and, the, bears, only, leave, their, den, once, outside, temperatures, are, at, their, lower, critical, temperature, these, findings, suggest, that, bears, are, thermoconforming, and, bear, hibernation, is, driven, by, environmental, cues, but, arousal, is, driven, by, physiological, cues, ancient, people, believed, that, swallows, hibernated, and, ornithologist, gilbert, white, documented, anecdotal, evidence, in, his, 1789, book, the, natural, history, of, selborne, that, indicated, the, belief, was, still, current, in, his, time, it, is, now, understood, that, the, vast, majority, of, bird, species, typically, do, not, hibernate, instead, utilizing, torpor, one, known, exception, is, the, common, poorwill, phalaenoptilus, nuttallii, for, which, hibernation, was, first, documented, by, edmund, jaeger, because, they, cannot, actively, down, regulate, their, body, temperature, or, metabolic, rate, ectothermic, animals, including, fish, reptiles, and, amphibians, cannot, engage, in, obligate, or, facultative, hibernation, they, can, experience, decreased, metabolic, rates, associated, with, colder, environments, or, low, oxygen, availability, hypoxia, and, exhibit, dormancy, known, as, brumation, it, was, once, thought, that, basking, sharks, settled, to, the, floor, of, the, north, sea, and, became, dormant, but, research, by, david, sims, in, 2003, dispelled, this, hypothesis, showing, that, the, sharks, traveled, long, distances, throughout, the, seasons, tracking, the, areas, with, the, highest, quantity, of, plankton, epaulette, sharks, have, been, documented, to, be, able, to, survive, for, three, hours, without, oxygen, and, at, temperatures, of, up, to, 26, c, 79, f, as, a, means, to, survive, in, their, shoreline, habitat, where, water, and, oxygen, levels, vary, with, the, tide, other, animals, able, to, survive, long, periods, with, very, little, or, no, oxygen, include, goldfish, red, eared, sliders, wood, frogs, and, bar, headed, geese, the, ability, to, survive, hypoxic, or, anoxic, conditions, is, not, closely, related, to, endotherm, hibernation, some, animals, can, literally, survive, winter, by, freezing, for, example, some, fish, amphibians, and, reptiles, can, naturally, freeze, and, then, wake, up, in, the, spring, these, species, have, evolved, freeze, tolerance, mechanism, such, as, antifreeze, proteins, hibernation, induction, trigger, hit, proteins, isolated, from, mammals, have, been, used, in, the, study, of, organ, recovery, rates, one, study, in, 1997, found, that, delta, 2, opioid, and, hibernation, induction, trigger, hit, proteins, were, not, able, to, increase, the, recovery, rate, of, heart, tissue, during, ischemia, while, unable, to, increase, recovery, rates, at, the, time, of, ischemia, the, protein, precursors, were, identified, to, play, a, role, in, the, preservation, of, veterinary, organ, function, recent, advances, in, recombinant, protein, technology, make, it, possible, for, scientists, to, manufacture, hibernation, induction, trigger, hit, proteins, in, the, laboratory, without, the, need, for, animal, euthanasia, bioengineering, of, proteins, can, aid, in, the, protection, of, vulnerable, populations, of, bears, and, other, mammals, that, produce, valuable, proteins, protein, sequencing, of, hit, proteins, such, as, 1, glycoprotein, like, 88, kda, hibernation, related, protein, hrp, contributes, to, this, research, pool, a, study, in, 2014, utilizes, recombinant, technology, to, construct, express, purify, and, isolate, animal, proteins, hp, 20, hp, 25, and, hp, 27, outside, of, the, animal, to, study, key, hibernation, proteins, hp, researchers, have, studied, how, to, induce, hibernation, in, humans, the, ability, to, hibernate, would, be, useful, for, a, number, of, reasons, such, as, saving, the, lives, of, seriously, ill, or, injured, people, by, temporarily, putting, them, in, a, state, of, hibernation, until, treatment, can, be, given, for, space, travel, human, hibernation, is, also, under, consideration, such, as, for, missions, to, mars, anthropologists, are, also, studying, whether, hibernation, was, possible, in, early, hominid, species, as, the, ancestors, of, birds, and, mammals, colonized, land, leaving, the, relatively, stable, marine, environments, more, intense, terrestrial, seasons, began, playing, a, larger, role, in, animals, lives, some, marine, animals, do, go, through, periods, of, dormancy, but, the, effect, is, stronger, and, more, widespread, in, terrestrial, environments, as, hibernation, is, a, seasonal, response, the, movement, of, the, ancestor, of, birds, and, mammals, onto, land, introduced, them, to, seasonal, pressures, that, would, eventually, become, hibernation, this, is, true, for, all, clades, of, animals, that, undergo, winter, dormancy, the, more, prominent, the, seasons, are, the, longer, the, dormant, period, tends, to, be, on, average, hibernation, of, endothermic, animals, has, likely, evolved, multiple, times, at, least, once, in, mammals, though, it, is, debated, whether, or, not, it, evolved, more, than, once, in, mammals, and, at, least, once, in, birds, in, both, cases, hibernation, likely, evolved, simultaneously, with, endothermy, with, the, earliest, suggested, instance, of, hibernation, being, in, thrinaxodon, an, ancestor, of, mammals, that, lived, roughly, 252, million, years, ago, the, evolution, of, endothermy, allowed, animals, to, have, greater, levels, of, activity, and, better, incubation, of, embryos, among, other, benefits, for, animals, in, the, permian, and, triassic, periods, in, order, to, conserve, energy, the, ancestors, of, birds, and, mammals, would, likely, have, experienced, an, early, form, of, torpor, or, hibernation, when, they, were, not, using, their, thermoregulatory, abilities, during, the, transition, from, ectothermy, to, endothermy, this, is, opposed, to, the, previously, dominant, hypothesis, that, hibernation, evolved, after, endothermy, in, response, to, the, emergence, of, colder, habitats, body, size, also, had, an, effect, on, the, evolution, of, hibernation, as, endotherms, which, grow, large, enough, tend, to, lose, their, ability, to, be, selectively, heterothermic, with, bears, being, one, of, very, few, exceptions, after, torpor, and, hibernation, diverged, from, a, common, proto, hibernating, ancestor, of, birds, and, mammals, the, ability, to, hibernate, or, go, through, torpor, would, have, been, lost, in, most, larger, mammals, and, birds, hibernation, would, be, less, favored, in, larger, animals, because, as, animals, increase, in, size, the, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, decreases, and, it, takes, less, energy, to, keep, a, high, internal, body, temperature, and, thus, hibernation, becomes, unnecessary, there, is, evidence, that, hibernation, evolved, separately, in, marsupials, and, placental, mammals, though, it, is, not, settled, that, evidence, stems, from, development, where, as, soon, as, young, marsupials, from, hibernating, species, are, able, to, regulate, their, own, heat, they, have, the, capability, to, hibernate, in, contrast, placental, mammals, that, hibernate, first, develop, homeothermy, only, developing, the, ability, to, hibernate, at, a, later, point, this, difference, in, development, is, evidence, though, inconclusive, that, they, evolved, by, slightly, different, mechanisms, and, thus, at, different, times, as, reptiles, are, ectothermic, having, no, system, to, deal, with, cold, temperatures, would, be, deadly, in, many, environments, reptilian, winter, dormancy, or, brumation, likely, evolved, to, help, reptiles, survive, colder, conditions, reptiles, that, are, dormant, in, the, winter, tend, to, have, higher, survival, rates, and, slower, aging, reptiles, evolved, to, exploit, their, ectothermy, to, deliberately, cool, their, internal, body, temperatures, as, opposed, to, mammals, or, birds, which, will, prepare, for, their, hibernation, but, not, directly, cause, it, through, their, behavior, reptiles, will, trigger, their, own, hibernation, through, their, behavior, reptiles, seek, out, colder, temperatures, based, on, a, periodic, internal, clock, which, is, likely, triggered, by, cooler, outside, temperatures, as, shown, in, the, texas, horned, lizard, phrynosoma, cornutum, one, mechanism, that, reptiles, use, to, survive, hibernation, hypercapnic, acidosis, the, buildup, of, carbon, dioxide, in, the, blood, is, also, present, in, mammal, hibernation, this, is, likely, an, example, of, convergent, evolution, hypercapnic, acidosis, evolved, as, a, mechanism, to, slow, metabolism, and, also, interfere, with, oxygen, transport, so, that, oxygen, is, not, used, up, and, can, still, reach, tissues, in, low, oxygen, periods, of, dormancy, seasonal, diapause, or, arthropod, winter, dormancy, seems, to, be, plastic, and, quickly, evolving, with, large, genetic, variation, and, strong, effects, of, natural, selection, present, as, well, as, having, evolved, many, times, across, many, clades, of, arthropods, as, such, there, is, very, little, phylogenetic, conservation, in, the, genetic, mechanism, for, diapause, particularly, the, timing, and, extent, of, the, seasonal, diapause, seem, particularly, variable, currently, evolving, as, a, response, to, climate, change, as, typical, with, hibernation, it, evolved, after, the, increased, influence, of, seasonality, as, arthropods, colonized, terrestrial, environments, as, a, mechanism, to, keep, energy, costs, low, particularly, in, harsher, than, normal, environments, as, well, as, being, a, good, way, to, time, the, active, or, reproductive, periods, in, arthropods, it, is, thought, to, have, originally, evolved, in, three, stages, the, first, is, development, of, neuroendocrine, control, over, bodily, functions, the, second, is, pairing, of, that, to, environmental, changes, in, this, case, metabolic, rates, decreasing, in, response, to, colder, temperatures, and, the, third, is, the, pairing, of, these, controls, with, reliable, seasonal, indicators, within, the, arthropod, like, biological, timers, from, these, steps, arthropods, developed, a, seasonal, diapause, where, many, of, their, biological, functions, end, up, paired, with, a, seasonal, rhythm, within, the, organism, this, is, a, very, similar, mechanism, to, the, evolution, of, insect, migration, where, instead, of, bodily, functions, like, metabolism, getting, paired, with, seasonal, indicators, movement, patterns, would, be, paired, with, seasonal, indicators, while, most, animals, that, go, through, winter, dormancy, lower, their, metabolic, rates, some, fish, such, as, the, cunner, do, not, instead, they, do, not, actively, depress, their, base, metabolic, rate, but, instead, they, simply, reduce, their, activity, level, fish, that, undergo, winter, dormancy, in, oxygenated, water, survive, via, inactivity, paired, with, the, colder, temperature, which, decreases, energy, consumption, but, not, the, base, metabolic, rate, that, their, bodies, consume, but, for, the, antarctic, yellowbelly, rockcod, notothenia, coriiceps, and, for, fish, that, undergo, winter, dormancy, in, hypoxic, conditions, they, do, suppress, their, metabolism, like, other, animals, that, are, dormant, in, the, winter, the, mechanism, for, evolution, of, metabolic, suppression, in, fish, is, unknown, most, fish, that, are, dormant, in, the, winters, save, enough, energy, by, being, still, and, so, there, is, not, a, strong, selective, pressure, to, develop, a, metabolic, suppression, mechanism, like, that, which, is, necessary, in, hypoxic, conditions
