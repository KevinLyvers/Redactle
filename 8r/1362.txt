gout, a, t, gowt, is, a, form, of, inflammatory, arthritis, characterized, by, recurrent, attacks, of, pain, in, a, red, tender, hot, and, swollen, joint, caused, by, the, deposition, of, needle, like, crystals, of, uric, acid, known, as, monosodium, urate, crystals, pain, typically, comes, on, rapidly, reaching, maximal, intensity, in, less, than, 12, hours, the, joint, at, the, base, of, the, big, toe, is, affected, podagra, in, about, half, of, cases, it, may, also, result, in, tophi, kidney, stones, or, kidney, damage, gout, is, due, to, persistently, elevated, levels, of, uric, acid, urate, in, the, blood, hyperuricemia, this, occurs, from, a, combination, of, diet, other, health, problems, and, genetic, factors, at, high, levels, uric, acid, crystallizes, and, the, crystals, deposit, in, joints, tendons, and, surrounding, tissues, resulting, in, an, attack, of, gout, gout, occurs, more, commonly, in, those, who, regularly, drink, beer, or, sugar, sweetened, beverages, eat, foods, that, are, high, in, purines, such, as, liver, shellfish, or, anchovies, or, are, overweight, diagnosis, of, gout, may, be, confirmed, by, the, presence, of, crystals, in, the, joint, fluid, or, in, a, deposit, outside, the, joint, blood, uric, acid, levels, may, be, normal, during, an, attack, treatment, with, nonsteroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, nsaids, glucocorticoids, or, colchicine, improves, symptoms, once, the, acute, attack, subsides, levels, of, uric, acid, can, be, lowered, via, lifestyle, changes, and, in, those, with, frequent, attacks, allopurinol, or, probenecid, provides, long, term, prevention, taking, vitamin, c, and, having, a, diet, high, in, low, fat, dairy, products, may, be, preventive, gout, affects, about, 1, 2, of, adults, in, the, developed, world, at, some, point, in, their, lives, it, has, become, more, common, in, recent, decades, this, is, believed, to, be, due, to, increasing, risk, factors, in, the, population, such, as, metabolic, syndrome, longer, life, expectancy, and, changes, in, diet, older, males, are, most, commonly, affected, gout, was, historically, known, as, the, disease, of, kings, or, rich, man, s, disease, it, has, been, recognized, at, least, since, the, time, of, the, ancient, egyptians, gout, can, present, in, several, ways, although, the, most, common, is, a, recurrent, attack, of, acute, inflammatory, arthritis, a, red, tender, hot, swollen, joint, the, metatarsophalangeal, joint, at, the, base, of, the, big, toe, is, affected, most, often, accounting, for, half, of, cases, other, joints, such, as, the, heels, knees, wrists, and, fingers, may, also, be, affected, joint, pain, usually, begins, during, the, night, and, peaks, within, 24, hours, of, onset, this, is, mainly, due, to, lower, body, temperature, other, symptoms, may, rarely, occur, along, with, the, joint, pain, including, fatigue, and, high, fever, long, standing, elevated, uric, acid, levels, hyperuricemia, may, result, in, other, symptoms, including, hard, painless, deposits, of, uric, acid, crystals, called, tophi, extensive, tophi, may, lead, to, chronic, arthritis, due, to, bone, erosion, elevated, levels, of, uric, acid, may, also, lead, to, crystals, precipitating, in, the, kidneys, resulting, in, kidney, stone, formation, and, subsequent, acute, uric, acid, nephropathy, the, crystallization, of, uric, acid, often, related, to, relatively, high, levels, in, the, blood, is, the, underlying, cause, of, gout, this, can, occur, because, of, diet, genetic, predisposition, or, underexcretion, of, urate, the, salts, of, uric, acid, underexcretion, of, uric, acid, by, the, kidney, is, the, primary, cause, of, hyperuricemia, in, about, 90, of, cases, while, overproduction, is, the, cause, in, less, than, 10, about, 10, of, people, with, hyperuricemia, develop, gout, at, some, point, in, their, lifetimes, the, risk, however, varies, depending, on, the, degree, of, hyperuricemia, when, levels, are, between, 415, and, 530, mol, l, 7, and, 8, 9, mg, dl, the, risk, is, 0, 5, per, year, while, in, those, with, a, level, greater, than, 535, mol, l, 9, mg, dl, the, risk, is, 4, 5, per, year, dietary, causes, account, for, about, 12, of, gout, and, include, a, strong, association, with, the, consumption, of, alcohol, sugar, sweetened, beverages, meat, and, seafood, among, foods, richest, in, purines, yielding, high, amounts, of, uric, acid, are, dried, anchovies, shrimp, organ, meat, dried, mushrooms, seaweed, and, beer, yeast, chicken, and, potatoes, also, appear, related, other, triggers, include, physical, trauma, and, surgery, studies, in, the, early, 2000s, found, that, other, dietary, factors, are, not, relevant, specifically, a, diet, with, moderate, purine, rich, vegetables, e, g, beans, peas, lentils, and, spinach, is, not, associated, with, gout, neither, is, total, dietary, protein, alcohol, consumption, is, strongly, associated, with, increased, risk, with, wine, presenting, somewhat, less, of, a, risk, than, beer, or, spirits, eating, skim, milk, powder, enriched, with, glycomacropeptide, gmp, and, g600, milk, fat, extract, may, reduce, pain, but, may, result, in, diarrhea, and, nausea, physical, fitness, healthy, weight, low, fat, dairy, products, and, to, a, lesser, extent, coffee, and, taking, vitamin, c, appear, to, decrease, the, risk, of, gout, however, taking, vitamin, c, supplements, does, not, appear, to, have, a, significant, effect, in, people, who, already, have, established, gout, peanuts, brown, bread, and, fruit, also, appear, protective, this, is, believed, to, be, partly, due, to, their, effect, in, reducing, insulin, resistance, other, than, dietary, and, lifestyle, choices, the, recurrence, of, gout, attacks, is, also, linked, to, the, weather, high, ambient, temperature, and, low, relative, humidity, may, increase, the, risk, of, a, gout, attack, gout, is, partly, genetic, contributing, to, about, 60, of, variability, in, uric, acid, level, the, slc2a9, slc22a12, and, abcg2, genes, have, been, found, to, be, commonly, associated, with, gout, and, variations, in, them, can, approximately, double, the, risk, loss, of, function, mutations, in, slc2a9, and, slc22a12, causes, low, blood, uric, acid, levels, by, reducing, urate, absorption, and, unopposed, urate, secretion, the, rare, genetic, disorders, familial, juvenile, hyperuricemic, nephropathy, medullary, cystic, kidney, disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate, synthetase, superactivity, and, hypoxanthine, guanine, phosphoribosyltransferase, deficiency, as, seen, in, lesch, nyhan, syndrome, are, complicated, by, gout, gout, frequently, occurs, in, combination, with, other, medical, problems, metabolic, syndrome, a, combination, of, abdominal, obesity, hypertension, insulin, resistance, and, abnormal, lipid, levels, occurs, in, nearly, 75, of, cases, other, conditions, commonly, complicated, by, gout, include, lead, poisoning, kidney, failure, hemolytic, anemia, psoriasis, solid, organ, transplants, and, myeloproliferative, disorders, such, as, polycythemia, a, body, mass, index, greater, than, or, equal, to, 35, increases, male, risk, of, gout, threefold, chronic, lead, exposure, and, lead, contaminated, alcohol, are, risk, factors, for, gout, due, to, the, harmful, effect, of, lead, on, kidney, function, diuretics, have, been, associated, with, attacks, of, gout, but, a, low, dose, of, hydrochlorothiazide, does, not, seem, to, increase, risk, other, medications, that, increase, the, risk, include, niacin, aspirin, acetylsalicylic, acid, ace, inhibitors, angiotensin, receptor, blockers, beta, blockers, ritonavir, and, pyrazinamide, the, immunosuppressive, drugs, ciclosporin, and, tacrolimus, are, also, associated, with, gout, the, former, more, so, when, used, in, combination, with, hydrochlorothiazide, hyperuricemia, may, be, induced, by, excessive, use, of, vitamin, d, supplements, levels, of, serum, uric, acid, have, been, positively, associated, with, 25, oh, d, the, incidence, of, hyperuricemia, increased, 9, 4, for, every, 10, nmol, l, increase, in, 25, oh, d, p, 0, 001, gout, is, a, disorder, of, purine, metabolism, and, occurs, when, its, final, metabolite, uric, acid, crystallizes, in, the, form, of, monosodium, urate, precipitating, and, forming, deposits, tophi, in, joints, on, tendons, and, in, the, surrounding, tissues, microscopic, tophi, may, be, walled, off, by, a, ring, of, proteins, which, blocks, interaction, of, the, crystals, with, cells, and, therefore, avoids, inflammation, naked, crystals, may, break, out, of, walled, off, tophi, due, to, minor, physical, damage, to, the, joint, medical, or, surgical, stress, or, rapid, changes, in, uric, acid, levels, when, they, break, through, the, tophi, they, trigger, a, local, immune, mediated, inflammatory, reaction, in, macrophages, which, is, initiated, by, the, nlrp3, inflammasome, protein, complex, activation, of, the, nlrp3, inflammasome, recruits, the, enzyme, caspase, 1, which, converts, pro, interleukin, 1, into, active, interleukin, 1, one, of, the, key, proteins, in, the, inflammatory, cascade, an, evolutionary, loss, of, urate, oxidase, uricase, which, breaks, down, uric, acid, in, humans, and, higher, primates, has, made, this, condition, common, the, triggers, for, precipitation, of, uric, acid, are, not, well, understood, while, it, may, crystallize, at, normal, levels, it, is, more, likely, to, do, so, as, levels, increase, other, triggers, believed, to, be, important, in, acute, episodes, of, arthritis, include, cool, temperatures, rapid, changes, in, uric, acid, levels, acidosis, articular, hydration, and, extracellular, matrix, proteins, the, increased, precipitation, at, low, temperatures, partly, explains, why, the, joints, in, the, feet, are, most, commonly, affected, rapid, changes, in, uric, acid, may, occur, due, to, factors, including, trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, and, diuretics, the, starting, or, increasing, of, urate, lowering, medications, can, lead, to, an, acute, attack, of, gout, with, febuxostat, of, a, particularly, high, risk, calcium, channel, blockers, and, losartan, are, associated, with, a, lower, risk, of, gout, compared, to, other, medications, for, hypertension, gout, may, be, diagnosed, and, treated, without, further, investigations, in, someone, with, hyperuricemia, and, the, classic, acute, arthritis, of, the, base, of, the, great, toe, known, as, podagra, synovial, fluid, analysis, should, be, done, if, the, diagnosis, is, in, doubt, plain, x, rays, are, usually, normal, and, are, not, useful, for, confirming, a, diagnosis, of, early, gout, they, may, show, signs, of, chronic, gout, such, as, bone, erosion, a, definitive, diagnosis, of, gout, is, based, upon, the, identification, of, monosodium, urate, crystals, in, synovial, fluid, or, a, tophus, all, synovial, fluid, samples, obtained, from, undiagnosed, inflamed, joints, by, arthrocentesis, should, be, examined, for, these, crystals, under, polarized, light, microscopy, they, have, a, needle, like, morphology, and, strong, negative, birefringence, this, test, is, difficult, to, perform, and, requires, a, trained, observer, the, fluid, must, be, examined, relatively, soon, after, aspiration, as, temperature, and, ph, affect, solubility, hyperuricemia, is, a, classic, feature, of, gout, but, nearly, half, of, the, time, gout, occurs, without, hyperuricemia, and, most, people, with, raised, uric, acid, levels, never, develop, gout, thus, the, diagnostic, utility, of, measuring, uric, acid, levels, is, limited, hyperuricemia, is, defined, as, a, plasma, urate, level, greater, than, 420, mol, l, 7, 0, mg, dl, in, males, and, 360, mol, l, 6, 0, mg, dl, in, females, other, blood, tests, commonly, performed, are, white, blood, cell, count, electrolytes, kidney, function, and, erythrocyte, sedimentation, rate, esr, however, both, the, white, blood, cells, and, esr, may, be, elevated, due, to, gout, in, the, absence, of, infection, a, white, blood, cell, count, as, high, as, 40, 0, 10, 9, l, 40, 000, mm, 3, has, been, documented, the, most, important, differential, diagnosis, in, gout, is, septic, arthritis, this, should, be, considered, in, those, with, signs, of, infection, or, those, who, do, not, improve, with, treatment, to, help, with, diagnosis, a, synovial, fluid, gram, stain, and, culture, may, be, performed, other, conditions, that, can, look, similar, include, cppd, pseudogout, rheumatoid, arthritis, psoriatic, arthritis, palindromic, rheumatism, and, reactive, arthritis, gouty, tophi, in, particular, when, not, located, in, a, joint, can, be, mistaken, for, basal, cell, carcinoma, or, other, neoplasms, risk, of, gout, attacks, can, be, lowered, by, complete, abstinence, from, drinking, alcoholic, beverages, reducing, the, intake, of, fructose, e, g, high, fructose, corn, syrup, and, purine, rich, foods, of, animal, origin, such, as, organ, meats, and, seafood, eating, dairy, products, vitamin, c, rich, foods, coffee, and, cherries, may, help, prevent, gout, attacks, as, does, losing, weight, gout, may, be, secondary, to, sleep, apnea, via, the, release, of, purines, from, oxygen, starved, cells, treatment, of, apnea, can, lessen, the, occurrence, of, attacks, as, of, 2020, allopurinol, is, generally, the, recommended, preventative, treatment, if, medications, are, used, a, number, of, other, medications, may, occasionally, be, considered, to, prevent, further, episodes, of, gout, including, probenecid, febuxostat, benzbromarone, and, colchicine, long, term, medications, are, not, recommended, until, a, person, has, had, two, attacks, of, gout, unless, destructive, joint, changes, tophi, or, urate, nephropathy, exist, it, is, not, until, this, point, that, medications, are, cost, effective, they, are, not, usually, started, until, one, to, two, weeks, after, an, acute, flare, has, resolved, due, to, theoretical, concerns, of, worsening, the, attack, they, are, often, used, in, combination, with, either, an, nsaid, or, colchicine, for, the, first, three, to, six, months, while, it, has, been, recommended, that, urate, lowering, measures, should, be, increased, until, serum, uric, acid, levels, are, below, 300, 360, mol, l, 5, 0, 6, 0, mg, dl, there, is, little, evidence, to, support, this, practice, over, simply, putting, people, on, a, standard, dose, of, allopurinol, if, these, medications, are, in, chronic, use, at, the, time, of, an, attack, it, is, recommended, that, they, be, continued, levels, that, cannot, be, brought, below, 6, 0, mg, dl, while, attacks, continue, indicates, refractory, gout, while, historically, it, is, not, recommended, to, start, allopurinol, during, an, acute, attack, of, gout, this, practice, appears, acceptable, allopurinol, blocks, uric, acid, production, and, is, the, most, commonly, used, agent, long, term, therapy, is, safe, and, well, tolerated, and, can, be, used, in, people, with, renal, impairment, or, urate, stones, although, hypersensitivity, occurs, in, a, small, number, of, individuals, the, hla, b, 58, 01, allele, of, the, human, leukocyte, antigen, b, hla, b, is, strongly, associated, with, severe, cutaneous, adverse, reactions, during, treatment, with, allopurinol, and, is, most, common, among, asian, subpopulations, notably, those, of, korean, han, chinese, or, thai, descent, febuxostat, is, only, recommended, in, those, who, cannot, tolerate, allopurinol, there, are, concerns, about, more, deaths, with, febuxostat, compared, to, allopurinol, febuxostat, may, also, increase, the, rate, of, gout, flares, during, early, treatment, however, there, is, tentative, evidence, that, febuxostat, may, bring, down, urate, levels, more, than, allopurinol, probenecid, appears, to, be, less, effective, than, allopurinol, and, is, a, second, line, agent, probenecid, may, be, used, if, undersecretion, of, uric, acid, is, present, 24, hour, urine, uric, acid, less, than, 800, mg, it, is, however, not, recommended, if, a, person, has, a, history, of, kidney, stones, probenecid, can, be, used, in, a, combined, therapy, with, allopurinol, is, more, effective, than, allopurinol, monotherapy, pegloticase, is, an, option, for, the, 3, of, people, who, are, intolerant, to, other, medications, it, is, a, third, line, agent, pegloticase, is, given, as, an, intravenous, infusion, every, two, weeks, and, reduces, uric, acid, levels, pegloticase, is, useful, decreasing, tophi, but, has, a, high, rate, of, side, effects, and, many, people, develop, resistance, to, it, using, lesinurad, 400, mg, plus, febuxostat, is, more, beneficial, for, tophi, resolution, than, lesinural, 200, ml, with, febuxostat, with, similar, side, effects, lesinural, plus, allopurinol, is, not, effective, for, tophi, resolution, potential, side, effects, include, kidney, stones, anemia, and, joint, pain, in, 2016, it, was, withdrawn, from, the, european, market, lesinurad, reduces, blood, uric, acid, levels, by, preventing, uric, acid, absorption, in, the, kidneys, it, was, approved, in, the, united, states, for, use, together, with, allopurinol, among, those, who, were, unable, to, reach, their, uric, acid, level, targets, side, effects, include, kidney, problems, and, kidney, stones, the, initial, aim, of, treatment, is, to, settle, the, symptoms, of, an, acute, attack, repeated, attacks, can, be, prevented, by, medications, that, reduce, serum, uric, acid, levels, tentative, evidence, supports, the, application, of, ice, for, 20, to, 30, minutes, several, times, a, day, to, decrease, pain, options, for, acute, treatment, include, nonsteroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, nsaids, colchicine, and, glucocorticoids, while, glucocorticoids, and, nsaids, work, equally, well, glucocorticoids, may, be, safer, options, for, prevention, include, allopurinol, febuxostat, and, probenecid, lowering, uric, acid, levels, can, cure, the, disease, treatment, of, associated, health, problems, is, also, important, lifestyle, interventions, have, been, poorly, studied, it, is, unclear, whether, dietary, supplements, have, an, effect, in, people, with, gout, nsaids, are, the, usual, first, line, treatment, for, gout, no, specific, agent, is, significantly, more, or, less, effective, than, any, other, improvement, may, be, seen, within, four, hours, and, treatment, is, recommended, for, one, to, two, weeks, they, are, not, recommended, for, those, with, certain, other, health, problems, such, as, gastrointestinal, bleeding, kidney, failure, or, heart, failure, while, indometacin, has, historically, been, the, most, commonly, used, nsaid, an, alternative, such, as, ibuprofen, may, be, preferred, due, to, its, better, side, effect, profile, in, the, absence, of, superior, effectiveness, for, those, at, risk, of, gastric, side, effects, from, nsaids, an, additional, proton, pump, inhibitor, may, be, given, there, is, some, evidence, that, cox, 2, inhibitors, may, work, as, well, as, nonselective, nsaids, for, acute, gout, attack, with, fewer, side, effects, colchicine, is, an, alternative, for, those, unable, to, tolerate, nsaids, at, high, doses, side, effects, primarily, gastrointestinal, upset, limit, its, usage, at, lower, doses, which, are, still, effective, it, is, well, tolerated, colchicine, may, interact, with, other, commonly, prescribed, drugs, such, as, atorvastatin, and, erythromycin, among, others, glucocorticoids, have, been, found, to, be, as, effective, as, nsaids, and, may, be, used, if, contraindications, exist, for, nsaids, they, also, lead, to, improvement, when, injected, into, the, joint, a, joint, infection, must, be, excluded, however, as, glucocorticoids, worsen, this, condition, there, were, no, short, term, adverse, effects, reported, interleukin, 1, inhibitors, such, as, canakinumab, showed, moderate, effectiveness, for, pain, relief, and, reduction, of, joint, swelling, but, have, increased, risk, of, adverse, events, such, as, back, pain, headache, and, increased, blood, pressure, they, however, may, work, less, well, than, usual, doses, of, nsaids, the, high, cost, of, this, class, of, drugs, may, also, discourage, their, use, for, treating, gout, without, treatment, an, acute, attack, of, gout, usually, resolves, in, five, to, seven, days, however, 60, of, people, have, a, second, attack, within, one, year, those, with, gout, are, at, increased, risk, of, hypertension, diabetes, mellitus, metabolic, syndrome, and, kidney, and, cardiovascular, disease, and, thus, are, at, increased, risk, of, death, it, is, unclear, whether, medications, that, lower, urate, affect, cardiovascular, disease, risks, this, may, be, partly, due, to, its, association, with, insulin, resistance, and, obesity, but, some, of, the, increased, risk, appears, to, be, independent, without, treatment, episodes, of, acute, gout, may, develop, into, chronic, gout, with, destruction, of, joint, surfaces, joint, deformity, and, painless, tophi, these, tophi, occur, in, 30, of, those, who, are, untreated, for, five, years, often, in, the, helix, of, the, ear, over, the, olecranon, processes, or, on, the, achilles, tendons, with, aggressive, treatment, they, may, dissolve, kidney, stones, also, frequently, complicate, gout, affecting, between, 10, and, 40, of, people, and, occur, due, to, low, urine, ph, promoting, the, precipitation, of, uric, acid, other, forms, of, chronic, kidney, dysfunction, may, occur, gout, affects, around, 1, 2, of, people, in, the, western, world, at, some, point, in, their, lifetimes, and, is, becoming, more, common, some, 5, 8, million, people, were, affected, in, 2013, rates, of, gout, approximately, doubled, between, 1990, and, 2010, this, rise, is, believed, to, be, due, to, increasing, life, expectancy, changes, in, diet, and, an, increase, in, diseases, associated, with, gout, such, as, metabolic, syndrome, and, high, blood, pressure, factors, that, influence, rates, of, gout, include, age, race, and, the, season, of, the, year, in, men, over, 30, and, women, over, 50, rates, are, 2, in, the, united, states, gout, is, twice, as, likely, in, males, of, african, descent, than, those, of, european, descent, rates, are, high, among, polynesians, but, the, disease, is, rare, in, aboriginal, australians, despite, a, higher, mean, uric, acid, serum, concentration, in, the, latter, group, it, has, become, common, in, china, polynesia, and, urban, sub, saharan, africa, some, studies, found, that, attacks, of, gout, occur, more, frequently, in, the, spring, this, has, been, attributed, to, seasonal, changes, in, diet, alcohol, consumption, physical, activity, and, temperature, taiwan, hong, kong, and, singapore, have, releatively, higher, prevalence, of, gout, a, study, based, on, the, national, health, insurance, research, database, nhird, estimated, that, 4, 92, of, taiwanese, residents, have, gout, in, 2004, a, survey, hold, by, the, hong, kong, government, found, that, 5, 1, of, hong, kong, resident, between, 45, 59, years, and, 6, 1, of, those, older, than, 60, years, have, gout, a, study, hold, in, singapore, found, that, 2, 117, in, 52, 322, people, between, 45, 74, years, have, gout, roughly, equals, to, 4, 1, the, english, term, gout, first, occurs, in, the, work, of, randolphus, of, bocking, around, 1200, ad, it, derives, from, the, latin, word, gutta, meaning, a, drop, of, liquid, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, this, originates, from, humorism, and, the, notion, of, the, dropping, of, a, morbid, material, from, the, blood, in, and, around, the, joints, gout, has, been, known, since, antiquity, historically, wits, have, referred, to, it, as, the, king, of, diseases, and, the, disease, of, kings, or, as, rich, man, s, disease, the, ebers, papyrus, and, the, edwin, smith, papyrus, c, 1550, bc, each, mention, arthritis, of, the, first, metacarpophalangeal, joint, as, a, distinct, type, of, arthritis, these, ancient, manuscripts, cite, now, missing, egyptian, texts, about, gout, that, are, claimed, to, have, been, written, 1, 000, years, earlier, and, ascribed, to, imhotep, greek, physician, hippocrates, around, 400, bc, commented, on, it, in, his, aphorisms, noting, its, absence, in, eunuchs, and, premenopausal, women, aulus,
