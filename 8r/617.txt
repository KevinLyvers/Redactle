6, living, see, text, cygnanser, kretzoi, 1957, swans, are, birds, of, the, genus, cygnus, within, the, family, anatidae, the, swans, closest, relatives, include, the, geese, and, ducks, swans, are, grouped, with, the, closely, related, geese, in, the, subfamily, anserinae, where, they, form, the, tribe, cygnini, sometimes, they, are, considered, a, distinct, subfamily, cygninae, there, are, six, living, and, many, extinct, species, of, swan, in, addition, there, is, a, species, known, as, the, coscoroba, swan, which, is, no, longer, considered, one, of, the, true, swans, swans, usually, mate, for, life, although, separation, sometimes, occurs, particularly, following, nesting, failure, and, if, a, mate, dies, the, remaining, swan, will, take, up, with, another, the, number, of, eggs, in, each, clutch, ranges, from, three, to, eight, the, genus, cygnus, was, introduced, in, 1764, by, the, french, naturalist, fran, ois, alexandre, pierre, de, garsault, the, english, word, swan, akin, to, the, german, schwan, dutch, zwaan, and, swedish, svan, is, derived, from, the, indo, european, root, swen, h, to, sound, to, sing, young, swans, are, known, as, cygnets, or, less, commonly, as, swanlings, the, former, derives, from, old, french, cigne, or, cisne, diminutive, suffix, et, little, from, the, latin, word, cygnus, a, variant, form, of, cycnus, swan, itself, from, the, greek, k, knos, a, word, of, the, same, meaning, an, adult, male, is, a, cob, from, middle, english, cobbe, leader, of, a, group, an, adult, female, is, a, pen, a, group, of, swans, is, called, a, bevy, or, a, wedge, swans, are, the, largest, extant, members, of, the, waterfowl, family, anatidae, and, are, among, the, largest, flying, birds, the, largest, living, species, including, the, mute, swan, trumpeter, swan, and, whooper, swan, can, reach, a, length, of, over, 1, 5, m, 59, in, and, weigh, over, 15, kg, 33, lb, their, wingspans, can, be, over, 3, 1, m, 10, ft, compared, to, the, closely, related, geese, they, are, much, larger, and, have, proportionally, larger, feet, and, necks, adults, also, have, a, patch, of, unfeathered, skin, between, the, eyes, and, bill, the, sexes, are, alike, in, plumage, but, males, are, generally, bigger, and, heavier, than, females, the, biggest, species, of, swan, ever, was, the, extinct, cygnus, falconeri, a, flightless, giant, swan, known, from, fossils, found, on, the, mediterranean, islands, of, malta, and, sicily, its, disappearance, is, thought, to, have, resulted, from, extreme, climate, fluctuations, or, the, arrival, of, superior, predators, and, competitors, the, northern, hemisphere, species, of, swan, have, pure, white, plumage, but, the, southern, hemisphere, species, are, mixed, black, and, white, the, australian, black, swan, cygnus, atratus, is, completely, black, except, for, the, white, flight, feathers, on, its, wings, the, chicks, of, black, swans, are, light, grey, the, south, american, black, necked, swan, has, a, white, body, with, a, black, neck, the, legs, of, most, swans, are, typically, a, dark, blackish, grey, colour, except, for, the, south, american, black, necked, swan, which, has, pink, legs, bill, colour, varies, the, four, subarctic, species, have, black, bills, with, varying, amounts, of, yellow, and, all, the, others, are, patterned, red, and, black, although, birds, do, not, have, teeth, swans, like, other, anatidae, have, beaks, with, serrated, edges, that, look, like, small, jagged, teeth, as, part, of, their, beaks, used, for, catching, and, eating, aquatic, plants, and, algae, but, also, molluscs, small, fish, frogs, and, worms, in, the, mute, swan, and, black, necked, swan, both, sexes, have, a, fleshy, lump, at, the, base, of, their, bills, on, the, upper, mandible, known, as, the, knob, which, is, larger, in, males, and, is, condition, dependent, changing, seasonally, swans, are, generally, found, in, temperate, environments, rarely, occurring, in, the, tropics, four, or, five, species, occur, in, the, northern, hemisphere, one, species, is, found, in, australia, one, extinct, species, was, found, in, new, zealand, and, the, chatham, islands, and, one, species, is, distributed, in, southern, south, america, they, are, absent, from, tropical, asia, central, america, northern, south, america, and, the, entirety, of, africa, one, species, the, mute, swan, has, been, introduced, to, north, america, australia, and, new, zealand, several, species, are, migratory, either, wholly, or, partly, so, the, mute, swan, is, a, partial, migrant, being, resident, over, areas, of, western, europe, but, wholly, migratory, in, eastern, europe, and, asia, the, whooper, swan, and, tundra, swan, are, wholly, migratory, and, the, trumpeter, swans, are, almost, entirely, migratory, there, is, some, evidence, that, the, black, necked, swan, is, migratory, over, part, of, its, range, but, detailed, studies, have, not, established, whether, these, movements, are, long, or, short, range, migration, swans, feed, in, water, and, on, land, they, are, almost, entirely, herbivorous, although, they, may, eat, small, amounts, of, aquatic, animals, in, the, water, food, is, obtained, by, up, ending, or, dabbling, and, their, diet, is, composed, of, the, roots, tubers, stems, and, leaves, of, aquatic, and, submerged, plants, a, familiar, behaviour, of, swans, is, that, they, mate, for, life, and, typically, bond, even, before, they, reach, sexual, maturity, trumpeter, swans, for, example, can, live, as, long, as, 24, years, and, only, start, breeding, at, the, age, of, 4, 7, forming, monogamous, pair, bonds, as, early, as, 20, months, divorce, though, rare, does, occur, one, study, of, mute, swans, shows, a, 3, rate, for, pairs, that, breed, successfully, and, 9, for, pairs, that, do, not, the, pair, bonds, are, maintained, year, round, even, in, gregarious, and, migratory, species, like, the, tundra, swan, which, congregate, in, large, flocks, in, the, wintering, grounds, swans, nests, are, on, the, ground, near, water, and, about, a, metre, 3, across, unlike, many, other, ducks, and, geese, the, male, helps, with, the, nest, construction, and, will, also, take, turns, incubating, the, eggs, alongside, the, whistling, ducks, swans, are, the, only, anatids, that, will, do, this, the, average, egg, size, for, the, mute, swan, is, 113, 74, mm, 4, 1, 2, x, 3, in, weighing, 340, g, 12, oz, in, a, clutch, size, of, 4, to, 7, and, an, incubation, period, of, 34, 45, days, swans, are, highly, protective, of, their, nests, they, will, viciously, attack, anything, that, they, perceive, as, a, threat, to, their, chicks, including, humans, one, man, was, suspected, to, have, drowned, in, such, an, attack, swans, intraspecific, aggressive, behaviour, is, shown, more, frequent, than, interspecific, behaviour, for, food, and, shelter, the, aggression, with, other, species, is, shown, more, in, tundra, swans, evidence, suggests, that, the, genus, cygnus, evolved, in, europe, or, western, eurasia, during, the, miocene, spreading, all, over, the, northern, hemisphere, until, the, pliocene, when, the, southern, species, branched, off, is, not, known, the, mute, swan, is, closest, to, the, southern, hemisphere, cygnus, its, habits, of, carrying, the, neck, curved, not, straight, and, the, wings, fluffed, not, flush, as, well, as, its, bill, colour, and, knob, indicate, that, its, closest, living, relative, is, the, black, swan, given, the, biogeography, and, appearance, of, the, subgenus, olor, it, seems, likely, that, these, are, of, a, more, recent, origin, as, evidenced, shows, by, their, modern, ranges, which, were, mostly, uninhabitable, during, the, last, ice, age, and, great, similarity, between, the, taxa, c, melancoryphus, black, necked, swan, c, atratus, latham, 1790, black, swan, c, olor, gmelin, 1789, mute, swan, c, buccinator, richardson,

species, in, its, genus, is, not, a, true, swan, its, phylogenetic, position, is, not, fully, resolved, it, is, in, some, aspects, more, similar, to, geese, and, shelducks, the, fossil, record, of, the, genus, cygnus, is, quite, impressive, although, allocation, to, the, subgenera, is, often, tentative, as, indicated, above, at, least, the, early, forms, probably, belong, to, the, c, olor, southern, hemisphere, lineage, whereas, the, pleistocene, taxa, from, north, america, would, be, placed, in, olor, several, prehistoric, species, have, been, described, mostly, from, the, northern, hemisphere, in, the, mediterranean, the, leg, bones, of, the, giant, swan, c, falconeri, were, found, on, the, islands, of, malta, and, sicily, it, may, have, been, over, 2, metres, from, tail, to, bill, which, was, taller, though, not, heavier, than, the, contemporary, local, dwarf, elephants, palaeoloxodon, falconeri, the, supposed, fossil, swans, cygnus, bilinicus, and, cygnus, herrenthalsi, were, respectively, a, stork, and, some, large, bird, of, unknown, affinity, due, to, the, bad, state, of, preservation, of, the, referred, material, many, of, the, cultural, aspects, refer, to, the, mute, swan, of, europe, perhaps, the, best, known, story, about, a, swan, is, the, fairy, tale, the, ugly, duckling, swans, are, often, a, symbol, of, love, or, fidelity, because, of, their, long, lasting, apparently, monogamous, relationships, see, wagner, s, famous, swan, related, operas, lohengrin, and, parsifal, swan, meat, was, regarded, as, a, luxury, food, in, england, during, the, reign, of, elizabeth, i, a, recipe, for, baked, swan, survives, from, that, time, to, bake, a, swan, scald, it, and, take, out, the, bones, and, parboil, it, then, season, it, very, well, with, pepper, salt, and, ginger, then, lard, it, and, put, it, in, a, deep, coffin, of, rye, paste, with, store, of, butter, close, it, and, bake, it, very, well, and, when, it, is, baked, fill, up, the, vent, hole, with, melted, butter, and, so, keep, it, serve, it, in, as, you, do, the, beef, pie, swans, being, raised, for, food, were, sometimes, kept, in, swan, pits, the, illustrious, brotherhood, of, our, blessed, lady, a, religious, confraternity, which, existed, in, s, hertogenbosch, in, the, late, middle, ages, had, sworn, members, also, called, swan, brethren, because, they, used, to, donate, a, swan, for, the, yearly, banquet, based, on, a, mistaken, belief, that, the, british, monarch, owns, all, the, swans, in, britain, it, is, popularly, believed, the, british, monarch, is,
