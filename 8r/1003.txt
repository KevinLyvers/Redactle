the, poinsettia, p, n, s, t, i, euphorbia, pulcherrima, is, a, commercially, important, flowering, plant, species, of, the, diverse, spurge, family, euphorbiaceae, indigenous, to, mexico, and, central, america, the, poinsettia, was, first, described, by, europeans, in, 1834, it, is, particularly, well, known, for, its, red, and, green, foliage, and, is, widely, used, in, christmas, floral, displays, it, derives, its, common, english, name, from, joel, roberts, poinsett, the, first, united, states, minister, to, mexico, who, is, credited, with, introducing, the, plant, to, the, us, in, the, 1820s, poinsettias, are, shrubs, or, small, trees, with, heights, of, 0, 6, to, 4, m, 2, 0, to, 13, 1, ft, though, often, stated, to, be, highly, toxic, the, poinsettia, is, not, dangerous, to, pets, or, children, exposure, to, the, plant, even, consumption, most, often, results, in, no, effect, though, it, can, cause, nausea, vomiting, or, diarrhea, wild, poinsettias, occur, from, mexico, to, southern, guatemala, growing, on, mid, elevation, pacific, facing, slopes, one, population, in, the, mexican, state, of, guerrero, is, much, further, inland, however, and, is, thought, to, be, the, ancestor, of, most, cultivated, populations, wild, poinsettia, populations, are, highly, fragmented, as, their, habitat, is, experiencing, largely, unregulated, deforestation, they, were, cultivated, by, the, aztecs, for, use, in, traditional, medicine, they, became, associated, with, the, christmas, holiday, and, are, popular, seasonal, decorations, every, year, in, the, united, states, approximately, 70, million, poinsettias, of, many, cultivated, varieties, are, sold, in, a, six, week, period, many, of, these, poinsettias, are, grown, by, paul, ecke, ranch, which, serves, half, the, worldwide, market, and, 70, percent, of, the, us, market, the, poinsettia, was, described, as, a, new, species, in, 1834, by, german, scientist, johann, friedrich, klotzsch, klotzsch, credited, carl, ludwig, willdenow, with, the, species, name, pulcherrima, and, the, authority, is, given, as, willd, ex, klotzsch, the, holotype, had, been, collected, in, mexico, during, an, 1803, 1804, expedition, by, alexander, von, humboldt, and, aim, bonpland, it, was, known, by, the, common, name, poinsettia, as, early, as, 1836, derived, from, joel, roberts, poinsett, a, botanist, and, the, first, us, minister, to, mexico, possibly, as, early, as, 1826, poinsett, began, sending, poinsettias, from, mexico, back, to, his, greenhouses, in, south, carolina, prior, to, poinsettia, it, was, known, as, mexican, flame, flower, or, painted, leaf, euphorbia, pulcherrima, is, a, shrub, or, small, tree, typically, reaching, a, height, of, 0, 6, 4, metres, 2, 13, ft, the, plant, bears, dark, green, dentate, leaves, that, measure, 6, 16, centimetres, 2, 4, 6, 3, in, in, length, the, colored, bracts, which, are, normally, flaming, red, with, cultivars, being, orange, pale, green, cream, pink, white, or, marbled, are, often, mistaken, for, flower, petals, because, of, their, groupings, and, colors, but, are, actually, leaves, the, colors, of, the, bracts, are, created, through, photoperiodism, meaning, that, they, require, darkness, at, least, fourteen, hours, at, a, time, for, 6, 8, weeks, in, a, row, to, change, color, the, plants, also, require, abundant, light, during, the, day, for, the, brightest, color, semi, evergreen, they, generally, lose, most, of, their, leaves, during, winter, the, flowers, of, the, poinsettia, are, unassuming, they, are, grouped, within, the, cyathia, small, yellow, structures, found, in, the, center, of, each, leaf, bunch, or, false, flowers, nothing, is, known, about, pollination, in, wild, poinsettias, though, wasps, are, noted, to, occasionally, visit, the, cyathia, all, flowers, in, the, euphorbiaceae, are, unisexual, either, male, or, female, only, and, they, are, often, very, small, in, size, in, euphorbia, the, flowers, are, reduced, even, more, and, then, aggregated, into, an, inflorescence, or, cluster, of, flowers, poinsettias, are, popularly, though, incorrectly, said, to, be, toxic, to, humans, and, other, animals, this, misconception, was, spread, by, a, 1919, urban, legend, of, a, two, year, old, child, dying, after, consuming, a, poinsettia, leaf, in, 1944, the, plant, was, included, in, h, r, arnold, s, book, poisonous, plants, of, hawaii, on, this, premise, though, arnold, later, admitted, that, the, story, was, hearsay, and, that, poinsettias, were, not, proven, to, be, poisonous, the, plant, was, thus, thought, deadly, in, 1970, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, published, a, newsletter, stating, erroneously, that, one, poinsettia, leaf, can, kill, a, child, and, in, 1980, they, were, prohibited, from, nursing, homes, in, a, county, in, north, carolina, due, to, this, supposed, toxicity, an, attempt, to, determine, a, poisonous, dose, of, poinsettia, to, rats, failed, even, after, reaching, experimental, doses, equivalent, to, consuming, 500, leaves, or, nearly, 1, kg, 2, 2, lb, of, sap, contact, with, any, part, of, the, plant, by, children, or, pets, often, has, no, effect, though, it, may, cause, nausea, diarrhea, or, vomiting, if, swallowed, external, exposure, to, the, plant, may, result, in, a, skin, rash, for, some, a, survey, of, more, than, 20, 000, calls, to, the, american, association, of, poison, control, centers, from, 1985, 1992, related, to, poinsettia, exposure, showed, no, fatalities, in, 92, 4, of, calls, there, was, no, effect, from, exposure, and, in, 3, 4, of, calls, there, were, minor, effects, defined, as, minimally, bothersome, similarly, a, cat, or, dog, s, exposure, to, poinsettias, rarely, necessitates, medical, treatment, if, ingested, mild, drooling, or, vomiting, can, occur, or, rarely, diarrhea, in, rare, cases, exposure, to, the, eye, may, result, in, eye, irritation, skin, exposure, to, the, sap, may, cause, itchiness, redness, or, swelling, it, can, induce, asthma, and, allergic, rhinitis, in, certain, groups, of, people, pulcherrol, and, pulcherryl, acetate, are, among, the, components, of, its, latex, triterpenes, are, found, in, aerial, parts, of, the, plant, including, its, latex, and, leaves, one, such, triterpenoid, skeleton, is, being, investigated, for, its, anti, alzheimer, s, disease, bioactivity, the, poinsettia, occurs, in, north, and, central, america, from, mexico, to, southern, guatemala, its, range, is, about, 2, 000, km, 1, 200, mi, long, encompassing, mid, elevation, tropical, dry, forests, most, wild, populations, are, on, pacific, facing, slopes, in, steep, canyons, populations, were, once, found, in, rolling, hill, areas, though, many, have, gone, extinct, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, the, inaccessibility, of, the, canyons, may, protect, the, wild, populations, from, human, disturbance, there, is, a, somewhat, anomalous, population, of, wild, poinsettias, in, the, northern, part, of, the, mexican, state, of, guerrero, and, oaxaca, which, is, much, further, inland, in, the, hot, and, seasonally, dry, forests, than, the, rest, of, the, species, range, genetic, analyses, showed, that, the, wild, populations, in, northern, guerrero, are, the, likely, ancestors, of, most, cultivated, poinsettias, the, tropical, dry, forests, where, wild, poinsettias, grow, experience, largely, unregulated, deforestation, resulting, in, habitat, loss, its, natural, habitat, is, thus, highly, fragmented, particularly, near, metropolitan, areas, such, as, taxco, population, sizes, are, frequently, very, small, with, as, few, as, a, dozen, individuals, populations, can, be, up, to, several, hundred, individuals, but, this, is, not, typical, a, conservation, risk, typical, for, species, with, wild, and, cultivated, populations, is, the, contamination, of, the, wild, gene, pool, by, hybridization, with, cultivated, individuals, this, has, not, been, documented, in, wild, poinsettias, though, as, cultivars, seldom, flower, and, do, not, produce, fruits, as, of, 2012, wild, poinsettias, were, not, protected, by, mexican, law, aztec, people, use, the, plant, to, produce, red, dye, and, as, an, antipyretic, medication, in, nahuatl, the, language, of, the, aztecs, the, plant, is, called, cuetlax, chitl, meaning, flower, that, grows, in, residues, or, soil, or, literally, excrement, flower, because, birds, would, eat, the, seeds, and, deposit, them, somewhere, and, so, it, seemed, that, the, seeds, would, germinate, and, grow, from, bird, droppings, today, it, is, known, in, mexico, and, guatemala, as, flor, de, nochebuena, or, simply, nochebuena, meaning, christmas, eve, flower, in, spain, it, is, known, as, flor, de, pascua, or, pascua, meaning, easter, flower, in, chile, and, peru, the, plant, became, known, as, the, crown, of, the, andes, from, the, 17th, century, franciscan, friars, in, mexico, included, the, plants, in, their, christmas, celebrations, the, star, shaped, leaf, pattern, is, said, to, symbolize, the, star, of, bethlehem, and, the, red, color, represents, the, blood, sacrifice, of, the, crucifixion, of, jesus, poinsettias, are, popular, christmas, decorations, in, homes, churches, offices, and, elsewhere, across, north, america, as, a, result, of, an, extensive, marketing, campaign, by, the, ecke, family, that, began, by, shipping, free, poinsettias, to, television, stations, for, use, on, air, in, the, us, december, 12, is, national, poinsettia, day, marking, the, anniversary, of, joel, roberts, poinsett, s, death, the, aztecs, were, the, first, to, cultivate, poinsettias, cultivation, in, the, us, began, when, diplomat, joel, roberts, poinsett, sent, some, of, the, plants, back, to, his, greenhouses, in, south, carolina, in, the, 1820s, specific, details, about, its, spread, from, there, are, largely, unverifiable, but, it, was, exhibited, at, the, pennsylvania, horticultural, society, s, 1829, philadelphia, flower, show, by, colonel, robert, carr, carr, described, it, as, a, new, euphorbia, with, bright, scarlet, bracts, or, floral, leaves, presented, to, the, bartram, collection, by, mr, poinsett, united, states, minister, of, mexico, the, poinsettia, is, the, world, s, most, economically, important, potted, plant, each, year, in, the, us, approximately, 70, million, poinsettias, are, sold, in, a, period, of, six, weeks, at, a, value, of, us, 250, million, in, puerto, rico, where, poinsettias, are, grown, extensively, in, greenhouses, the, industry, is, valued, at, 5, million, annually, there, are, over, 100, cultivated, varieties, of, poinsettia, that, have, been, patented, in, the, us, to, produce, extra, axillary, buds, that, are, necessary, for, plants, containing, multiple, flowers, a, phytoplasma, infection, whose, symptoms, include, the, proliferation, of, axillary, buds, is, used, the, discovery, of, the, role, phytoplasmas, play, in, the, growth, of, axillary, buds, is, credited, to, ing, ming, lee, of, the, usda, agricultural, research, service, albert, ecke, emigrated, from, germany, to, los, angeles, in, 1900, opening, a, dairy, and, orchard, in, the, eagle, rock, area, he, became, intrigued, by, the, plant, and, sold, them, from, street, stands, his, son, paul, ecke, developed, the, grafting, technique, but, it, was, the, third, generation, of, eckes, paul, ecke, jr, who, was, responsible, for, advancing, the, association, between, the, plant, and, christmas, besides, changing, the, market, from, mature, plants, shipped, by, rail, to, cuttings, sent, by, air, he, sent, free, plants, to, television, stations, for, them, to, display, on, air, from, thanksgiving, to, christmas, he, also, appeared, on, television, programs, like, the, tonight, show, and, bob, hope, s, christmas, specials, to, promote, the, plants, until, the, 1990s, the, ecke, family, who, had, moved, their, operation, to, encinitas, california, in, 1923, had, a, virtual, monopoly, on, poinsettias, owing, to, a, technique, that, made, their, plants, much, more, attractive, they, produced, a, fuller, more, compact, plant, by, grafting, two, varieties, of, poinsettia, together, a, poinsettia, left, to, grow, on, its, own, will, naturally, take, an, open, somewhat, weedy, look, the, eckes, technique, made, it, possible, to, get, every, seedling, to, branch, resulting, in, a, bushier, plant, in, the, late, 1980s, university, researcher, john, dole, discovered, the, grafting, method, grafting, rarer, densely, branched, cultivars, onto, more, common, sparsely, branched, cultivars, previously, known, only, to, the, eckes, and, published, it, this, allowed, competitors, to, flourish, particularly, those, using, low, cost, labor, in, latin, america, the, ecke, family, s, business, now, led, by, paul, ecke, iii, decided, to, stop, producing, plants, in, the, us, but, as, of, 2008, they, still, served, about, 70, percent, of, the, domestic, market, and, 50, percent, of, the, worldwide, market, poinsettias, are, susceptible, to, several, diseases, mostly, fungal, but, also, bacterial, and, parasitic, conditions, that, promote, poinsettia, propagation, also, favor, certain, diseases, fungal, diseases, affecting, greenhouse, poinsettia, operations, include, pythium, root, rot, rhizoctonia, root, and, stem, rot, black, root, rot, scab, powdery, mildew, and, botrytis, blight, bacterial, diseases, include, bacterial, soft, rot, and, bacterial, canker, while, a, viral, disease, is, poinsettia, mosaic, virus, infection, by, poinsettia, branch, inducing, phytoplasma, is, actually, desirable, as, it, keeps, the, plants, shorter, with, more, flowers, it, is, the, first, known, phytoplasma, that, has, economically, advantageous, effects
