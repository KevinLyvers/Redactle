the, dromedary, camelus, dromedarius, uk, d, r, m, d, r, i, d, r, m, or, us, d, r, i, also, known, as, the, dromedary, camel, arabian, camel, or, one, humped, camel, is, a, large, camel, of, the, genus, camelus, with, one, hump, on, its, back, it, is, the, tallest, of, the, three, species, of, camel, adult, males, stand, 1, 8, 2, 4, m, 5, ft, 11, in, 7, ft, 10, in, at, the, shoulder, while, females, are, 1, 7, 1, 9, m, 5, ft, 7, in, 6, ft, 3, in, tall, males, typically, weigh, between, 400, and, 690, kg, 880, and, 1, 520, lb, and, females, weigh, between, 300, and, 540, kg, 660, and, 1, 190, lb, the, species, distinctive, features, include, its, long, curved, neck, narrow, chest, a, single, hump, compared, with, two, on, the, bactrian, camel, and, wild, bactrian, camel, and, long, hairs, on, the, throat, shoulders, and, hump, the, coat, is, generally, a, shade, of, brown, the, hump, 20, cm, 7, 7, 8, in, tall, or, more, is, made, of, fat, bound, together, by, fibrous, tissue, dromedaries, are, mainly, active, during, daylight, hours, they, form, herds, of, about, 20, individuals, which, are, led, by, a, dominant, male, they, feed, on, foliage, and, desert, vegetation, several, adaptations, such, as, the, ability, to, tolerate, losing, more, than, 30, of, its, total, water, content, allow, it, to, thrive, in, its, desert, habitat, mating, occurs, annually, and, peaks, in, the, rainy, season, females, bear, a, single, calf, after, a, gestation, of, 15, months, the, dromedary, has, not, occurred, naturally, in, the, wild, for, nearly, 2, 000, years, it, was, probably, first, domesticated, in, the, arabian, peninsula, about, 4, 000, years, ago, or, in, somalia, where, there, are, paintings, in, laas, geel, that, figure, it, from, 5, 000, to, 9, 000, years, ago, in, the, wild, the, dromedary, inhabited, arid, regions, including, the, sahara, desert, the, domesticated, dromedary, is, generally, found, in, the, semi, arid, to, arid, regions, of, the, old, world, mainly, in, africa, and, the, arabian, peninsula, and, a, significant, feral, population, occurs, in, australia, products, of, the, dromedary, including, its, meat, and, milk, support, several, north, african, tribes, it, is, also, commonly, used, for, riding, and, as, a, pack, animal, the, common, name, dromedary, comes, from, the, old, french, dromedaire, or, the, late, latin, dromedarius, these, originated, from, the, greek, word, dromas, gen, dromados, meaning, running, or, runner, used, in, greek, in, the, combination, dromas, kamelos, literally, running, camel, to, refer, to, the, dromedary, the, first, recorded, use, in, english, of, the, name, dromedary, occurred, in, the, 14th, century, the, dromedary, possibly, originated, in, arabia, or, somalia, and, is, therefore, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, arabian, or, east, african, camel, the, word, camel, generally, refers, either, to, the, dromedary, or, the, congeneric, bactrian, the, word, came, into, english, via, old, norman, from, the, latin, word, cam, lus, from, ancient, greek, k, m, los, ultimately, from, a, semitic, source, akin, to, hebrew, gam, l, and, arabic, jamal, lamini, llamas, camelops, camelus, dromedarius, dromedary, camelus, knoblochi, camelus, ferus, wild, bactrian, camel, camelus, bactrianus, domestic, bactrian, camel, the, dromedary, shares, the, genus, camelus, with, the, bactrian, camel, c, bactrianus, and, the, wild, bactrian, camel, c, ferus, the, dromedary, belongs, to, the, family, camelidae, the, ancient, greek, philosopher, aristotle, 4th, century, bc, was, the, first, to, describe, the, species, of, camelus, he, named, two, species, in, his, history, of, animals, the, one, humped, arabian, camel, and, the, two, humped, bactrian, camel, the, dromedary, was, given, its, current, binomial, name, camelus, dromedarius, by, swedish, zoologist, carl, linnaeus, in, his, 1758, publication, systema, naturae, in, 1927, british, veterinarian, arnold, leese, classified, dromedaries, by, their, basic, habitats, the, hill, camels, are, small, muscular, animals, and, efficient, beasts, of, burden, the, larger, plains, camels, could, be, further, divided, into, the, desert, type, that, can, bear, light, burdens, and, are, apt, for, riding, and, the, riverine, type, slow, animals, that, can, bear, heavy, burdens, and, those, intermediate, between, these, two, types, in, 2007, peng, cui, of, the, chinese, academy, of, sciences, and, colleagues, carried, out, a, phylogenetic, study, of, the, evolutionary, relationships, between, the, two, tribes, of, camelidae, camelini, consisting, of, the, three, camelus, species, the, study, considered, the, wild, bactrian, camel, as, a, subspecies, of, the, bactrian, camel, and, lamini, which, consists, of, the, alpaca, vicugna, pacos, the, guanaco, lama, guanicoe, the, llama, l, glama, and, the, vicu, a, v, vicugna, the, study, showed, the, two, tribes, had, diverged, 25, million, years, ago, early, miocene, earlier, than, previously, estimated, from, north, american, fossils, the, dromedary, and, the, bactrian, camel, often, interbreed, to, produce, fertile, offspring, where, the, ranges, of, the, species, overlap, such, as, in, northern, punjab, persia, and, afghanistan, the, phenotypic, differences, between, them, tend, to, decrease, as, a, result, of, extensive, crossbreeding, the, fertility, of, their, hybrid, has, given, rise, to, speculation, that, the, dromedary, and, the, bactrian, camel, should, be, merged, into, a, single, species, with, two, varieties, however, a, 1994, analysis, of, the, mitochondrial, cytochrome, b, gene, showed, the, species, display, 10, 3, divergence, in, their, sequences, the, dromedary, has, 74, diploid, chromosomes, the, same, as, other, camelids, the, autosomes, consist, of, five, pairs, of, small, to, medium, sized, metacentrics, and, submetacentrics, the, x, chromosome, is, the, largest, in, the, metacentric, and, submetacentric, group, there, are, 31, pairs, of, acrocentrics, the, dromedary, s, karyotype, is, similar, to, that, of, the, bactrian, camel, camel, hybridization, began, in, the, first, millennium, bc, for, about, a, thousand, years, bactrian, camels, and, dromedaries, have, been, successfully, bred, in, regions, where, they, are, sympatric, to, form, hybrids, with, either, a, long, slightly, lopsided, hump, or, two, humps, one, small, and, one, large, these, hybrids, are, larger, and, stronger, than, their, parents, they, can, bear, greater, loads, a, cross, between, a, first, generation, female, hybrid, and, a, male, bactrian, camel, can, also, produce, a, hybrid, hybrids, from, other, combinations, tend, to, be, bad, tempered, or, runts, the, extinct, protylopus, which, occurred, in, north, america, during, the, upper, eocene, is, the, oldest, and, the, smallest, known, camel, during, the, transition, from, pliocene, to, pleistocene, several, mammals, faced, extinction, this, period, marked, the, successful, radiation, of, the, camelus, species, which, migrated, over, the, bering, strait, and, dispersed, widely, into, asia, eastern, europe, and, africa, by, the, pleistocene, ancestors, of, the, dromedary, occurred, in, the, middle, east, and, northern, africa, the, modern, dromedary, probably, evolved, in, the, hotter, arid, regions, of, western, asia, from, the, bactrian, camel, which, in, turn, was, closely, related, to, the, earliest, old, world, camels, it, was, previously, believed, that, this, hypothesis, was, supported, by, the, dromedary, foetus, having, two, humps, but, modern, studies, have, shown, this, to, be, false, a, jawbone, of, a, dromedary, that, dated, from, 8, 200, bc, was, found, in, saudi, arabia, on, the, southern, coast, of, the, red, sea, in, 1975, richard, bulliet, of, columbia, university, wrote, that, the, dromedary, exists, in, large, numbers, in, areas, from, which, the, bactrian, camel, has, disappeared, the, converse, is, also, true, to, a, great, extent, he, said, this, substitution, could, have, taken, place, because, of, the, heavy, dependence, on, the, milk, meat, and, wool, of, the, dromedary, by, syrian, and, arabian, nomads, while, the, asiatic, people, domesticated, the, bactrian, camel, but, did, not, have, to, depend, upon, its, products, the, dromedary, is, the, tallest, of, the, three, camel, species, adult, males,

darfur, in, sudan, piebald, coloration, in, some, camels, is, thought, to, be, caused, by, the, kit, w1, allele, of, the, kit, gene, though, there, is, likely, at, least, one, other, mutation, that, also, causes, white, spotting, the, hair, is, long, and, concentrated, on, the, throat, shoulders, and, the, hump, the, large, eyes, are, protected, by, prominent, supraorbital, ridges, the, ears,

presence, of, mers, cov, in, 90, of, the, evaluated, dromedaries, and, suggested, that, camels, could, be, the, animal, source, of, mers, cov, fleas, and, ticks, are, common, causes, of, physical, irritation, hyalomma, dromedarii, is, especially, adapted, to, arid, conditions, changing, its, moulting, process, to, complete, more, or, all, of, its, life, cycle, on, a, single, host, if, stressed, and, having, an, unusually, wide, host, range, the, larvae, are, not, well, understood, but, their, questing, phase, is, assumed, to, occur, during, the, winter, which, is, also, when, rain, arrives, the, nymphs, infest, the, host, mostly, in, january, then, the, adults, may, to, september, in, a, study, in, egypt, h, dromedarii, was, dominant, in, dromedaries, comprising, 95, 6, of, the, adult, ticks, isolated, from, the, camels, in, israel, the, number, of, ticks, per, camel, ranged, from, 20, to, 105, nine, camels, in, the, date, palm, plantations, in, arava, valley, were, injected, with, ivermectin, which, is, not, effective, against, hyalomma, tick, infestations, larvae, of, the, camel, nasal, fly, cephalopsis, titillator, can, cause, possibly, fatal, brain, compression, and, nervous, disorders, illnesses, that, can, affect, dromedary, productivity, are, pyogenic, diseases, and, wound, infections, caused, by, corynebacterium, and, streptococcus, pulmonary, disorders, caused, by, pasteurella, such, as, hemorrhagic, septicemia, and, rickettsia, species, camelpox, anthrax, and, cutaneous, necrosis, caused, by, streptothrix, and, deficiency, of, salt, in, the, diet, the, dromedary, is, diurnal, active, mainly, during, daylight, free, ranging, herds, feed, and, roam, throughout, the, day, though, they, rest, during, the, hottest, hours, around, noon, the, night, is, mainly, spent, resting, dromedaries, form, cohesive, groups, of, about, 20, individuals, which, consist, of, several, females, led, by, a, dominant, male, females, may, also, lead, in, turns, some, males, either, form, bachelor, groups, or, roam, alone, herds, may, congregate, to, form, associations, of, hundreds, of, camels, during, migrations, at, the, time, of, natural, disasters, the, males, of, the, herd, prevent, female, members, from, interacting, with, bachelor, males, by, standing, or, walking, between, them, and, sometimes, driving, the, bachelor, males, away, in, australia, short, term, home, ranges, of, feral, dromedaries, cover, 50, to, 150, km, 2, 19, to, 58, sq, mi, annual, home, ranges, can, spread, over, several, thousand, square, kilometres, special, behavioral, features, of, the, dromedary, include, snapping, at, others, without, biting, them, and, showing, displeasure, by, stamping, their, feet, they, are, generally, non, aggressive, with, the, exception, of, rutting, males, they, appear, to, remember, their, homes, females, in, particular, remember, the, places, they, first, gave, birth, or, suckled, their, offspring, males, become, aggressive, in, the, mating, season, and, sometimes, wrestle, a, 1980, study, showed, androgen, levels, in, males, influences, their, behavior, between, january, and, april, when, these, levels, are, high, during, the, rut, they, become, difficult, to, manage, blow, out, the, palate, from, the, mouth, vocalize, and, throw, urine, over, their, backs, camels, scratch, parts, of, their, bodies, with, their, legs, or, with, their, lower, incisors, they, may, also, rub, against, tree, bark, and, roll, in, the, sand, free, ranging, dromedaries, face, large, predators, typical, of, their, regional, distribution, which, includes, wolves, lions, and, tigers, the, dromedary, s, diet, consists, mostly, of, foliage, dry, grasses, and, desert, vegetation, mostly, thorny, plants, a, study, said, the, typical, diet, of, the, dromedary, is, dwarf, shrubs, 47, 5, trees, 29, 9, grasses, 11, 2, other, herbs, 0, 2, and, vines, 11, the, dromedary, is, primarily, a, browser, forbs, and, shrubs, comprise, 70, of, its, diet, in, summer, and, 90, of, its, diet, in, winter, the, dromedary, may, also, graze, on, tall, young, succulent, grasses, in, the, sahara, 332, plant, species, have, been, recorded, as, food, plants, of, the, dromedary, these, include, aristida, pungens, acacia, tortilis, panicum, turgidum, launaea, arborescens, and, balanites, aegyptiaca, the, dromedary, eats, acacia, atriplex, and, salsola, when, they, are, available, feral, dromedaries, in, australia, prefer, trichodesma, zeylanicum, and, euphorbia, tannensis, in, india, dromedaries, are, fed, with, forage, plants, such, as, vigna, aconitifolia, v, mungo, cyamopsis, tetragonolaba, melilotus, parviflora, eruca, sativa, trifolium, species, and, brassica, campestris, dromedaries, keep, their, mouths, open, while, chewing, thorny, food, they, use, their, lips, to, grasp, the, food, and, chew, each, bite, 40, to, 50, times, its, long, eyelashes, eyebrows, lockable, nostrils, caudal, opening, of, the, prepuce, and, a, relatively, small, vulva, help, the, camel, avoid, injuries, especially, while, feeding, they, graze, for, 8, 12, hours, per, day, and, ruminate, for, an, equal, amount, of, time, the, dromedary, is, specially, adapted, to, its, desert, habitat, these, adaptations, are, aimed, at, conserving, water, and, regulating, body, temperature, the, bushy, eyebrows, and, the, double, row, of, eyelashes,

assists, in, water, conservation, the, dromedary, can, conserve, water, by, reducing, perspiration, by, fluctuating, the, body, temperature, throughout, the, day, from, 31, to, 41, 7, c, 87, 8, to, 107, 1, f, the, kidneys, are, specialized, to, minimize, water, loss, through, excretion, groups, of, camels, avoid, excess, heat, from, the, environment, by, pressing, against, each, other, the, dromedary, can, tolerate, greater, than, 30, water, loss, which, is, generally, impossible, for, other, mammals, in, temperatures, between, 30, and, 40, c, 86, and, 104, f, it, needs, water, every, 10, to, 15, days, in, the, hottest, temperatures, the, dromedary, takes, water, every, four, to, seven, days, this, camel, has, a, quick, rate, of, rehydration, and, can, drink, at, 10, 20, l, 2, 2, 4, 4, imp, gal, per, minute, the, dromedary, has, a, rete, mirabile, a, complex, of, arteries, and, veins, lying, very, close, to, each, other, which, uses, countercurrent, blood, flow, to, cool, blood, flowing, to, the, brain, this, effectively, controls, the, temperature, of, the, brain, the, hump, stores, up, to, 80, lb, 36, kg, of, fat, which, the, camel, can, break, down, into, energy, to, meet, its, needs, when, resources, are, scarce, the, hump, also, helps, dissipate, body, heat, when, this, tissue, is, metabolized, through, fat, metabolization, it, releases, energy, while, causing, water, to, evaporate, from, the, lungs, during, respiration, as, oxygen, is, required, for, the, metabolic, process, overall, there, is, a, net, decrease, in, water, if, the, hump, is, small,

the, near, east, and, western, and, central, asia, the, dromedary, typically, thrives, in, areas, with, a, long, dry, season, and, a, short, wet, season, they, are, sensitive, to, cold, and, humidity, though, some, breeds, can, thrive, in, humid, conditions, the, dromedary, may, have, been, first, domesticated, in, somalia, or, the, arabian, peninsula, about, 4, 000, years, ago, in, the, ninth, or, tenth, century, bc, the, dromedary, became, popular, in, the, near, east, the, persian, invasion, of, egypt, under, cambyses, in, 525, bc, introduced, domesticated, camels, to, the, area, the, persian, camels, were, not, well, suited, to, trading, or, travel, over, the, sahara, journeys, across, the, desert, were, made, on, chariots, pulled, by, horses, the, dromedary, was, introduced, into, egypt, from, south, western, asia, arabia, and, persia, the, popularity, of, dromedaries, increased, after, the, islamic, conquest, of, north, africa, while, the, invasion, was, accomplished, largely, on, horseback, new, links, to, the, middle, east, allowed, camels, to, be, imported, en, masse, these, camels, were, well, suited, to, long, desert, journeys, and, could, carry, a, great, deal, of, cargo, allowing, substantial, trans, saharan, trade, for, the, first, time, in, libya, dromedaries, were, used, for, transport, and, their, milk, and, meat, constituted, the, local, diet, dromedaries, were, also, shipped, from, south, western, asia, to, spain, italy, turkey, france, canary, islands, the, americas, and, australia, dromedaries, were, introduced, into, spain, in, 1020, ad, and, to, sicily, in, 1059, ad, camels, were, exported, to, the, canary, islands, in, 1405, during, the, european, colonisation, of, the, area, and, are, still, extant, there, especially, in, lanzarote, and, to, the, south, of, fuerteventura, attempts, to, introduce, dromedaries, into, the, caribbean, colombia, peru, bolivia, and, brazil, were, made, between, the, 17th, and, 19th, centuries, some, were, imported, to, the, western, united, states, in, the, 1850s, and, some, to, namibia, in, the, early, 1900s, but, presently, they, exist, in, small, numbers, or, are, absent, in, these, areas, in, 1840, about, six, camels, were, shipped, from, tenerife, to, adelaide, but, only, one, survived, the, journey, to, arrive, on, 12, october, that, year, the, animal, a, male, called, harry, was, owned, by, the, explorer, john, ainsworth, horrocks, harry, was, ill, tempered, but, was, included, in, an, expedition, the, following, year, because, he, could, carry, heavy, loads, the, next, major, group, of, camels, were, imported, into, australia, in, 1860, and, between, 1860, and, 1907, 10, to, 12, thousand, were, imported, these, were, used, mainly, for, riding, and, transport, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, domesticated, dromedary, is, found, in, the, semi, arid, to, arid, regions, of, the, old, world, africa, has, more, than, 80, of, the, world, s, total, dromedary, population, it, occurs, in, almost, every, desert, zone, in, the, northern, part, of, the, continent, the, sahel, marks, the, southern, extreme, of, its, range, where, the, annual, rainfall, is, around, 550, mm, 22, in, the, horn, of, africa, has, nearly, 35, of, the, world, s, dromedaries, most, of, the, region, s, stock, is, in, somalia, followed, by, sudan, eritrea, and, ethiopia, as, of, the, early, 2000s, according, to, the, yearbook, of, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, for, 1984, eastern, africa, had, about, 10, million, dromedaries, the, largest, population, of, africa, western, africa, followed, with, 2, 14, million, while, northern, africa, had, nearly, 0, 76, million, populations, in, africa, increased, by, 16, from, 1994, to, 2005, in, asia, nearly, 70, of, the, population, occurs, in, india, and, pakistan, the, combined, population, of, the, dromedary, and, the, bactrian, camel, decreased, by, around, 21, between, 1994, and, 2004, the, dromedary, is, sympatric, with, the, bactrian, camel, in, afghanistan, pakistan, and, central, and, southwestern, asia, india, has, a, dromedary, population, of, less, than, one, million, with, most, 0, 67, million, in, the, state, of, rajasthan, populations, in, pakistan, decreased, from, 1, 1, million, in, 1994, to, 0, 8, million, in, 2005, a, 29, decline, according, to, the, fao, the, dromedary, population, in, six, countries, of, the, persian, gulf, was, nearly, 0, 67, million, in, 2003, in, the, persian, gulf, region, the, dromedary, is, locally, classified, into, breeds, including, al, majahem, al, hamrah, al, safrah, al, zarkah, and, al, shakha, based, on, coat, colour, the, uae, has, three, prominent, breeds, racing, camel, al, arabiat, and, al, kazmiat, feral, dromedary, populations, occur, in, australia, where, they, were, introduced, in, 1840, the, total, dromedary, population, in, australia, was, 500, 000, in, 2005, nearly, 99, of, the, populations, are, feral, and, they, have, annual, growth, rate, of, 10, most, of, the, australian, feral, camels, are, dromedaries, with, only, a, few, bactrian, camels, most, of, the, dromedaries, occur, in, western, australia, with, smaller, populations, in, the, northern, territory, western, queensland, and, northern, south, australia, feral, dromedary, populations, notwithstanding, the, wild, dromedary, camel, as, opposed, to, the, now, domesticated, species, has, been, functionally, extinct, from, the, wild, for, the, past, 2, 000, years, the, strength, and, docility, of, the, dromedary, make, it, popular, as, a, domesticated, animal, according, to, richard, bulliet, they, can, be, used, for, a, wide, variety, of, purposes, riding, transport, ploughing, and, trading, and, as, a, source, of, milk, meat, wool, and, leather, the, main, attraction, of, the, dromedary, for, nomadic, desert, dwellers, is, the, wide, variety, of, resources, they, provide, which, are, crucial, for, their, survival, it, is, important, for, several, bedouin, pastoralist, tribes, of, northern, arabia, such, as, the, ruwallah, the, rashaida, the, bani, sakhr, and, the, mutayr, camel, urine, and, camel, milk, are, used, for, medicinal, purposes, although, the, role, of, the, camel, is, diminishing, with, the, advent, of, technology, and, modern, means, of, transport, it, is, still, an, efficient, mode, of, communication, in, remote, and, less, developed, areas, the, dromedary, has, been, used, in, warfare, since, the, 6th, century, bc, it, is, particularly, prized, for, its, capability, to, outrun, horses, in, the, deserts, record, of, its, use, during, the, time, of, alexander, the, great, indicate, that, the, animal, could, cover, up, to, 50, miles, per, day, for, a, week, and, they, could, go, for, up, to, a, month, without, water, an, account, by, aurelian, also, cited, that, in, his, escape, to, euphrates, zenobia, used, a, dromedary, to, outrun, his, pursuers, after, he, was, defeated, at, palmyra, the, dromedary, also, remains, popular, for, racing, particularly, in, the, arab, world, riding, camels, of, arabia, egypt, and, the, sahara, are, locally, known, as, the, dilool, the, hageen, and, the, mehara, respectively, several, local, breeds, are, included, within, these, groups, the, ideal, riding, camel, is, strong, slender, and, long, legged, with, thin, supple, skin, the, special, adaptations, of, the, dromedary, s, feet, allow, it, to, walk, with, ease, on, sandy, and, rough, terrain, and, on, cold, surfaces, the, camels, of, the, bejas, of, sudan, and, the, hedareb, bilen, and, the, tigre, people, of, eritrea, and, the, anafi, camel, bred, in, sudan, are, common, breeds, used, as, riding, camels, according, to, leese, the, dromedary, walks, with, four, speeds, or, gaits, walk, jog, fast, run, and, canter, the, first, is, the, typical, speed, of, walking, around, 4, km, h, 2, 5, mph, jog, is, the, most, common, speed, nearly, 8, 12, km, h, 5, 0, 7, 5, mph, on, level, ground, he, estimated, a, speed, of, 14, 19, km, h, 8, 7, 11, 8, mph, during, a, fast, run, by, observing, northern, african, and, arabian, dromedaries, he, gave, no, speed, range, to, describe, the, canter, but, implied, it, was, a, type, of, gallop, that, if, induced, could, exhaust, the, camel, and, the, rider, canter, could, be, used, only, for, short, periods, of, time, for, example, in, races, the, ideal, age, to, start, training, dromedaries, for, riding, is, three, years, although, they, may, be, stubborn, and, unruly, at, first, the, camel, s, head, is, controlled, and, it, is, later, trained, to, respond, to, sitting, and, standing, commands, and, to, allow, mounting, at, this, stage, a, camel, will, often, try, to, escape, when, a, trainer, tries, to, mount, it, the, next, stage, involves, training, it, to, respond, to, reins, the, animal, must, be, given, loads, gradually, and, not, forced, to, carry, heavy, loads, before, the, age, of, six, riding, camels, should, not, be, struck, on, their, necks, rather, they, should, be, struck, behind, the, right, leg, of, the, rider, leese, described, two, types, of, saddles, generally, used, in, camel, riding, the, arabian, markloofa, used, by, single, riders, and, the, indian, pakra, used, when, two, riders, mount, the, same, camel, the, baggage, camel, should, be, robust, and, heavy, studies, have, recommended, the, camel, should, have, either, a, small, or, a, large, head, with, a, narrow, aquiline, nose, prominent, eyes, and, large, lips, the, neck, should, be, medium, to, long, so, the, head, is, held, high, the, chest, should, be, deep, and, the, hump, should, be, well, developed, with, sufficient, space, behind, it, to, accommodate, the, saddle, the, hindlegs, should, be, heavy, muscular, and, sturdy, the, dromedary, can, be, trained, to, carry, baggage, from, the, age, of, five, years, but, must, not, be, given, heavy, loads, before, the, age, of, six, the, hawia, is, a, typical, baggage, saddle, from, sudan, the, methods, of, training, the, baggage, camels, are, similar, to, those, for, riding, camels, draught, camels, are, used, for, several, purposes, including, ploughing, processing, in, oil, mills, and, pulling, carts, there, is, no, clear, description, for, the, ideal, draught, camel, though, its, strength, its, ability, to, survive, without, water, and, the, flatness, of, its, feet, could, be, indicators, it, may, be, used, for, ploughing, in, pairs, or, in, groups, with, buffaloes, or, bullocks, the, draught, camel, can, plough, at, around, 2, 5, km, h, 1, 6, mph, and, should, not, be, used, for, more, than, six, hours, a, day, four, hours, in, the, morning, and, two, in, the, afternoon, the, camel, is, not, easily, exhausted, unless, diseased, or, undernourished, and, has, remarkable, endurance, and, hardiness, camel, milk, is, a, staple, food, of, nomadic, tribes, living, in, deserts, it, consists, of, 11, 7, solids, 3, protein,

to, 7, 8, of, the, body, weight, milk, yield, varies, geographically, and, depends, upon, the, animals, diet, and, living, conditions, at, the, peak, of, lactation, a, healthy, female, would, typically, provide, 9, kg, 20, lb, milk, per, day, leese, estimated, a, lactating, female, would, yield, 4, to, 9, l, 0, 88, to, 1, 98, imp, gal, besides, the, amount, ingested, by, the, calf, the, pakistani, dromedary, which, is, considered, a, better, milker, and, bigger, can, yield, 9, 1, 14, 1, kg, 20, 31, lb, when, well, fed, dromedaries, in, somalia, may, be, milked, between, two, and, four, times, a, day, while, those, in, afar, ethiopia, may, be, milked, up, to, seven, times, a, day, the, acidity, of, dromedary, milk, stored, at, 30, c, 86, f, increases, at, a, slower, rate, than, that, of, cow, milk, though, the, preparation, of, butter, from, dromedary, milk, is, difficult, it, is, produced, in, small, amounts, by, nomads, optimized, at, 22, 5, fat, in, the, cream, in, 2001, the, ability, of, dromedary, milk, to, form, curd, was, studied, coagulation, did, not, show, curd, formation, and, had, a, ph, of, 4, 4, it, was, much, different, from, curd, produced, from, cow, milk, and, had, a, fragile, heterogeneous, composition, probably, composed, of, casein, flakes, nevertheless, cheese, and, other, dairy, products, can, be, made, from, camel, milk, a, study, found, bovine, calf, rennet, could, be, used, to, coagulate, dromedary, milk, a, special, factory, has, been, set, up, in, nouakchott, to, pasteurise, and, make, cheese, from, camel, milk, mystical, beliefs, surround, the, use, of, camel, milk, in, some, places, for, example, it, may, be, used, as, an, aphrodisiac, in, ethiopia, the, meat, of, a, five, year, old, dromedary, has, a, typical, composition, of, 76, water, 22, protein, 1, fat, and, 1, ash, the, carcass, weighing, 141, 310, kg, 311, 683, lb, for, a, five, year, old, dromedary, is, composed, of, nearly, 57, muscle, 26, bone, and, 17, fat, a, seven, to, eight, year, old, camel, can, produce, a, carcass, of, 125, 400, kg, 276, 882, lb, the, meat, is, bright, red, to, a, dark, brown, or, maroon, while, the, fat, is, white, it, has, the, taste, and, texture, of, beef, a, study, of, the, meat, of, iranian, dromedaries, showed, its, high, glycogen, content, which, makes, it, taste, sweet, like, horse, meat, the, carcasses, of, well, fed, camels, were, found, to, be, covered, with, a, thin, layer, of, good, quality, fat, in, a, study, of, the, fatty, acid, composition, of, raw, meat, taken, from, the, hind, legs, of, seven, one,

slaughter, is, more, difficult, than, the, slaughter, of, other, domestic, livestock, such, as, cattle, because, of, the, size, of, the, animal, and, the, significant, manual, work, involved, more, males, than, females, are, slaughtered, though, less, affected, by, mishandling, than, other, livestock, the, pre, slaughter, handling, of, the, dromedary, plays, a, crucial, role, in, determining, the, quality, of, meat, obtained, mishandling, can, often, disfigure, the, hump, the, animal, is, stunned, seated, in, a, crouching, position, with, the, head, in, a, caudal, position, and, slaughtered, the, dressing, percentage, the, percentage, of, the, mass, of, the, animal, that, forms, the, carcass, is, 55, 70, more, than, the, 45, 50, of, cattle, camel, meat, is, often, eaten, by, african, camel, herders, who, use, it, only, during, severe, food, scarcity, or, for, rituals, camel, meat, is, processed, into, food, items, such, as, burgers, patties, sausages, and, shawarma, dromedaries, can, be, slaughtered, between, four, and, ten, years, of, age, as, the, animal, ages, the, meat, grows, tougher, and, deteriorates, in, taste, and, quality, in, somalian, and, djiboutian, culture, the, dromedary, is, a, staple, food, and, can, be, found, in, many, recipes, and, dishes, a, 2005, report, issued, jointly, by, the, ministry, of, health, saudi, arabia, and, the, united,
