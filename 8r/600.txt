birds, are, a, group, of, warm, blooded, vertebrates, constituting, the, class, aves, e, v, i, z, characterised, by, feathers, toothless, beaked, jaws, the, laying, of, hard, shelled, eggs, a, high, metabolic, rate, a, four, chambered, heart, and, a, strong, yet, lightweight, skeleton, birds, live, worldwide, and, range, in, size, from, the, 5, 5, cm, 2, 2, in, bee, hummingbird, to, the, 2, 8, m, 9, ft, 2, in, common, ostrich, there, are, over, 11, 000, living, species, more, than, half, of, which, are, passerine, or, perching, birds, birds, have, wings, whose, development, varies, according, to, species, the, only, known, groups, without, wings, are, the, extinct, moa, and, elephant, birds, wings, which, are, modified, forelimbs, gave, birds, the, ability, to, fly, although, further, evolution, has, led, to, the, loss, of, flight, in, some, birds, including, ratites, penguins, and, diverse, endemic, island, species, the, digestive, and, respiratory, systems, of, birds, are, also, uniquely, adapted, for, flight, some, bird, species, of, aquatic, environments, particularly, seabirds, and, some, waterbirds, have, further, evolved, for, swimming, the, study, of, birds, is, called, ornithology, birds, are, feathered, theropod, dinosaurs, and, constitute, the, only, known, living, dinosaurs, likewise, birds, are, considered, reptiles, in, the, modern, cladistic, sense, of, the, term, and, their, closest, living, relatives, are, the, crocodilians, birds, are, descendants, of, the, primitive, avialans, whose, members, include, archaeopteryx, which, first, appeared, during, the, late, jurassic, according, to, recent, estimates, modern, birds, neornithes, evolved, in, the, late, cretaceous, and, diversified, dramatically, around, the, time, of, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, 66, million, years, ago, which, killed, off, the, pterosaurs, and, all, non, avian, dinosaurs, many, social, species, preserve, knowledge, across, generations, culture, birds, are, social, communicating, with, visual, signals, calls, and, songs, and, participating, in, such, behaviours, as, cooperative, breeding, and, hunting, flocking, and, mobbing, of, predators, the, vast, majority, of, bird, species, are, socially, but, not, necessarily, sexually, monogamous, usually, for, one, breeding, season, at, a, time, sometimes, for, years, and, rarely, for, life, other, species, have, breeding, systems, that, are, polygynous, one, male, with, many, females, or, rarely, polyandrous, one, female, with, many, males, birds, produce, offspring, by, laying, eggs, which, are, fertilised, through, sexual, reproduction, they, are, usually, laid, in, a, nest, and, incubated, by, the, parents, most, birds, have, an, extended, period, of, parental, care, after, hatching, many, species, of, birds, are, economically, important, as, food, for, human, consumption, and, raw, material, in, manufacturing, with, domesticated, and, undomesticated, birds, being, important, sources, of, eggs, meat, and, feathers, songbirds, parrots, and, other, species, are, popular, as, pets, guano, bird, excrement, is, harvested, for, use, as, a, fertiliser, birds, figure, throughout, human, culture, about, 120, to, 130, species, have, become, extinct, due, to, human, activity, since, the, 17th, century, and, hundreds, more, before, then, human, activity, threatens, about, 1, 200, bird, species, with, extinction, though, efforts, are, underway, to, protect, them, recreational, birdwatching, is, an, important, part, of, the, ecotourism, industry, the, first, classification, of, birds, was, developed, by, francis, willughby, and, john, ray, in, their, 1676, volume, ornithologiae, carl, linnaeus, modified, that, work, in, 1758, to, devise, the, taxonomic, classification, system, currently, in, use, birds, are, categorised, as, the, biological, class, aves, in, linnaean, taxonomy, phylogenetic, taxonomy, places, aves, in, the, clade, theropoda, aves, and, a, sister, group, the, order, crocodilia, contain, the, only, living, representatives, of, the, reptile, clade, archosauria, during, the, late, 1990s, aves, was, most, commonly, defined, phylogenetically, as, all, descendants, of, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, modern, birds, and, archaeopteryx, lithographica, however, an, earlier, definition, proposed, by, jacques, gauthier, gained, wide, currency, in, the, 21st, century, and, is, used, by, many, scientists, including, adherents, to, the, phylocode, gauthier, defined, aves, to, include, only, the, crown, group, of, the, set, of, modern, birds, this, was, done, by, excluding, most, groups, known, only, from, fossils, and, assigning, them, instead, to, the, broader, group, avialae, on, the, principle, that, a, clade, based, on, extant, species, should, be, limited, to, those, extant, species, and, their, closest, extinct, relatives, gauthier, and, de, queiroz, identified, four, different, definitions, for, the, same, biological, name, aves, which, is, a, problem, the, authors, proposed, to, reserve, the, term, aves, only, for, the, crown, group, consisting, of, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, living, birds, and, all, of, its, descendants, which, corresponds, to, meaning, number, 4, below, they, assigned, other, names, to, the, other, groups, lizards, snakes, turtles, crocodiles, birds, under, the, fourth, definition, archaeopteryx, traditionally, considered, one, of, the, earliest, members, of, aves, is, removed, from, this, group, becoming, a, non, avian, dinosaur, instead, these, proposals, have, been, adopted, by, many, researchers, in, the, field, of, palaeontology, and, bird, evolution, though, the, exact, definitions, applied, have, been, inconsistent, avialae, initially, proposed, to, replace, the, traditional, fossil, content, of, aves, is, often, used, synonymously, with, the, vernacular, term, bird, by, these, researchers, coelurus, ornitholestes, ornithomimosauria, alvarezsauridae, oviraptorosauria, paraves, most, researchers, define, avialae, as, branch, based, clade, though, definitions, vary, many, authors, have, used, a, definition, similar, to, all, theropods, closer, to, birds, than, to, deinonychus, with, troodon, being, sometimes, added, as, a, second, external, specifier, in, case, it, is, closer, to, birds, than, to, deinonychus, avialae, is, also, occasionally, defined, as, an, apomorphy, based, clade, that, is, one, based, on, physical, characteristics, jacques, gauthier, who, named, avialae, in, 1986, re, defined, it, in, 2001, as, all, dinosaurs, that, possessed, feathered, wings, used, in, flapping, flight, and, the, birds, that, descended, from, them, despite, being, currently, one, of, the, most, widely, used, the, crown, group, definition, of, aves, has, been, criticised, by, some, researchers, lee, and, spencer, 1997, argued, that, contrary, to, what, gauthier, defended, this, definition, would, not, increase, the, stability, of, the, clade, and, the, exact, content, of, aves, will, always, be, uncertain, because, any, defined, clade, either, crown, or, not, will, have, few, synapomorphies, distinguishing, it, from, its, closest, relatives, their, alternative, definition, is, synonymous, to, avifilopluma, scansoriopterygidae, eosinopteryx, jinfengopteryx, aurornis, dromaeosauridae, troodontidae, avialae, based, on, fossil, and, biological, evidence, most, scientists, accept, that, birds, are, a, specialised, subgroup, of, theropod, dinosaurs, and, more, specifically, members, of, maniraptora, a, group, of, theropods, which, includes, dromaeosaurids, and, oviraptorosaurs, among, others, as, scientists, have, discovered, more, theropods, closely, related, to, birds, the, previously, clear, distinction, between, non, birds, and, birds, has, become, blurred, by, the, 2000s, discoveries, in, the, liaoning, province, of, northeast, china, which, demonstrated, many, small, theropod, feathered, dinosaurs, contributed, to, this, ambiguity, the, consensus, view, in, contemporary, palaeontology, is, that, the, flying, theropods, or, avialans, are, the, closest, relatives, of, the, deinonychosaurs, which, include, dromaeosaurids, and, troodontids, together, these, form, a, group, called, paraves, some, basal, members, of, deinonychosauria, such, as, microraptor, have, features, which, may, have, enabled, them, to, glide, or, fly, the, most, basal, deinonychosaurs, were, very, small, this, evidence, raises, the, possibility, that, the, ancestor, of, all, paravians, may, have, been, arboreal, have, been, able, to, glide, or, both, unlike, archaeopteryx, and, the, non, avialan, feathered, dinosaurs, who, primarily, ate, meat, studies, suggest, that, the, first, avialans, were, omnivores, the, late, jurassic, archaeopteryx, is, well, known, as, one, of, the, first, transitional, fossils, to, be, found, and, it, provided, support, for, the, theory, of, evolution, in, the, late, 19th, century, archaeopteryx, was, the, first, fossil, to, display, both, clearly, traditional, reptilian, characteristics, teeth, clawed, fingers, and, a, long, lizard, like, tail, as, well, as, wings, with, flight, feathers, similar, to, those, of, modern, birds, it, is, not, considered, a, direct, ancestor, of, birds, though, it, is, possibly, closely, related, to, the, true, ancestor, over, 40, of, key, traits, found, in, modern, birds, evolved, during, the, 60, million, year, transition, from, the, earliest, bird, line, archosaurs, to, the, first, maniraptoromorphs, i, e, the, first, dinosaurs, closer, to, living, birds, than, to, tyrannosaurus, rex, the, loss, of, osteoderms, otherwise, common, in, archosaurs, and, acquisition, of, primitive, feathers, might, have, occurred, early, during, this, phase, after, the, appearance, of, maniraptoromorpha, the, next, 40, million, years, marked, a, continuous, reduction, of, body, size, and, the, accumulation, of, neotenic, juvenile, like, characteristics, hypercarnivory, became, increasingly, less, common, while, braincases, enlarged, and, forelimbs, became, longer, the, integument, evolved, into, complex, pennaceous, feathers, the, oldest, known, paravian, and, probably, the, earliest, avialan, fossils, come, from, the, tiaojishan, formation, of, china, which, has, been, dated, to, the, late, jurassic, period, oxfordian, stage, about, 160, million, years, ago, the, avialan, species, from, this, time, period, include, anchiornis, huxleyi, xiaotingia, zhengi, and, aurornis, xui, the, well, known, probable, early, avialan, archaeopteryx, dates, from, slightly, later, jurassic, rocks, about, 155, million, years, old, from, germany, many, of, these, early, avialans, shared, unusual, anatomical, features, that, may, be, ancestral, to, modern, birds, but, were, later, lost, during, bird, evolution, these, features, include, enlarged, claws, on, the, second, toe, which, may, have, been, held, clear, of, the, ground, in, life, and, long, feathers, or, hind, wings, covering, the, hind, limbs, and, feet, which, may, have, been, used, in, aerial, maneuvering, avialans, diversified, into, a, wide, variety, of, forms, during, the, cretaceous, period, many, groups, retained, primitive, characteristics, such, as, clawed, wings, and, teeth, though, the, latter, were, lost, independently, in, a, number, of, avialan, groups, including, modern, birds, aves, increasingly, stiff, tails, especially, the, outermost, half, can, be, seen, in, the, evolution, of, maniraptoromorphs, and, this, process, culminated, in, the, appearance, of, the, pygostyle, an, ossification, of, fused, tail, vertebrae, in, the, late, cretaceous, about, 100, million, years, ago, the, ancestors, of, all, modern, birds, evolved, a, more, open, pelvis, allowing, them, to, lay, larger, eggs, compared, to, body, size, around, 95, million, years, ago, they, evolved, a, better, sense, of, smell, a, third, stage, of, bird, evolution, starting, with, ornithothoraces, the, bird, chested, avialans, can, be, associated, with, the, refining, of, aerodynamics, and, flight, capabilities, and, the, loss, or, co, ossification, of, several, skeletal, features, particularly, significant, are, the, development, of, an, enlarged, keeled, sternum, and, the, alula, and, the, loss, of, grasping, hands, anchiornis, archaeopteryx, xiaotingia, rahonavis, jeholornis, jixiangornis, balaur, zhongjianornis, sapeornis, confuciusornithiformes, protopteryx, pengornis, ornithothoraces, enantiornithes, archaeorhynchus, patagopteryx, vorona, schizooura, hongshanornithidae, jianchangornis, songlingornithidae, gansus, apsaravis, hesperornithes, ichthyornis, vegavis, aves, the, first, large, diverse, lineage, of, short, tailed, avialans, to, evolve, were, the, enantiornithes, or, opposite, birds, so, named, because, the, construction, of, their, shoulder, bones, was, in, reverse, to, that, of, modern, birds, enantiornithes, occupied, a, wide, array, of, ecological, niches, from, sand, probing, shorebirds, and, fish, eaters, to, tree, dwelling, forms, and, seed, eaters, while, they, were, the, dominant, group, of, avialans, during, the, cretaceous, period, enantiornithes, became, extinct, along, with, many, other, dinosaur, groups, at, the, end, of, the, mesozoic, era, many, species, of, the, second, major, avialan, lineage, to, diversify, the, euornithes, meaning, true, birds, because, they, include, the, ancestors, of, modern, birds, were, semi, aquatic, and, specialised, in, eating, fish, and, other, small, aquatic, organisms, unlike, the, enantiornithes, which, dominated, land, based, and, arboreal, habitats, most, early, euornithes, lacked, perching, adaptations, and, likely, included, shorebird, like, species, waders, and, swimming, and, diving, species, the, latter, included, the, superficially, gull, like, ichthyornis, and, the, hesperornithiformes, which, became, so, well, adapted, to, hunting, fish, in, marine, environments, that, they, lost, the, ability, to, fly, and, became, primarily, aquatic, the, early, euornithes, also, saw, the, development, of, many, traits, associated, with, modern, birds, like, strongly, keeled, breastbones, toothless, beaked, portions, of, their, jaws, though, most, non, avian, euornithes, retained, teeth, in, other, parts, of, the, jaws, euornithes, also, included, the, first, avialans, to, develop, true, pygostyle, and, a, fully, mobile, fan, of, tail, feathers, which, may, have, replaced, the, hind, wing, as, the, primary, mode, of, aerial, maneuverability, and, braking, in, flight, a, study, on, mosaic, evolution, in, the, avian, skull, found, that, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, neornithes, might, have, had, a, beak, similar, to, that, of, the, modern, hook, billed, vanga, and, a, skull, similar, to, that, of, the, eurasian, golden, oriole, as, both, species, are, small, aerial, and, canopy, foraging, omnivores, a, similar, ecological, niche, was, inferred, for, this, hypothetical, ancestor, ratites, and, tinamous, landfowl, and, waterfowl, all, other, birds, including, perching, birds, most, studies, agree, on, a, cretaceous, age, for, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, modern, birds, but, estimates, range, from, the, early, cretaceous, to, the, latest, cretaceous, similarly, there, is, no, agreement, on, whether, most, of, the, early, diversification, of, modern, birds, occurred, in, the, cretaceous, and, associated, with, breakup, of, the, supercontinent, gondwana, or, occurred, later, and, potentially, as, a, consequence, of, the, cretaceous, palaeogene, extinction, event, this, disagreement, is, in, part, caused, by, a, divergence, in, the, evidence, most, molecular, dating, studies, suggests, a, cretaceous, evolutionary, radiation, while, fossil, evidence, points, to, a, cenozoic, radiation, the, so, called, rocks, versus, clocks, controversy, the, discovery, of, vegavis, from, the, maastrichtian, the, last, stage, of, the, late, cretaceous, proved, that, the, diversification, of, modern, birds, started, before, the, cenozoic, era, the, affinities, of, an, earlier, fossil, the, possible, galliform, austinornis, lentus, dated, to, about, 85, million, years, ago, are, still, too, controversial, to, provide, a, fossil, evidence, of, modern, bird, diversification, in, 2020, asteriornis, from, the, maastrichtian, was, described, it, appears, to, be, a, close, relative, of, galloanserae, the, earliest, diverging, lineage, within, neognathae, attempts, to, reconcile, molecular, and, fossil, evidence, using, genomic, scale, dna, data, and, comprehensive, fossil, information, have, not, resolved, the, controversy, however, a, 2015, estimate, that, used, a, new, method, for, calibrating, molecular, clocks, confirmed, that, while, modern, birds, originated, early, in, the, late, cretaceous, likely, in, western, gondwana, a, pulse, of, diversification, in, all, major, groups, occurred, around, the, cretaceous, palaeogene, extinction, event, modern, birds, would, have, expanded, from, west, gondwana, through, two, routes, one, route, was, an, antarctic, interchange, in, the, paleogene, the, other, route, was, probably, via, paleocene, land, bridges, between, south, america, and, north, america, which, allowed, for, the, rapid, expansion, and, diversification, of, neornithes, into, the, holarctic, and, paleotropics, on, the, other, hand, the, occurrence, of, asteriornis, in, the, northern, hemisphere, suggest, that, neornithes, dispersed, out, of, east, gondwana, before, the, paleocene, all, modern, birds, lie, within, the, crown, group, aves, alternately, neornithes, which, has, two, subdivisions, the, palaeognathae, which, includes, the, flightless, ratites, such, as, the, ostriches, and, the, weak, flying, tinamous, and, the, extremely, diverse, neognathae, containing, all, other, birds, these, two, subdivisions, have, variously, been, given, the, rank, of, superorder, cohort, or, infraclass, the, number, of, known, living, bird, species, is, around, 11, 000, although, sources, may, differ,

assignment, of, orders, is, accurate, but, scientists, disagree, about, the, relationships, among, the, orders, themselves, evidence, from, modern, bird, anatomy, fossils, and, dna, have, all, been, brought, to, bear, on, the, problem, but, no, strong, consensus, has, emerged, fossil, and, molecular, evidence, from, the, 2010s, is, providing, an, increasingly, clear, picture, of, the, evolution, of, modern, bird, orders, as, of, 2010, the, genome, had, been, sequenced, for, only, two, birds, the, chicken, and, the, zebra, finch, as, of, 2022, the, genomes, of, 542, species, of, birds, had, been, completed, at, least, one, genome, has, been, sequenced, from, every, order, these, include, at, least, one, species, in, about, 90, of, extant, avian, families, 218, out, of, 236, families, recognised, by, the, howard, and, moore, checklist, being, able, to, sequence, and, compare, whole, genomes, gives, researchers, many, types, of, information, about, genes, the, dna, that, regulates, the, genes, and, their, evolutionary, history, this, has, led, to, reconsideration, of, some, of, the, classifications, that, were, based, solely, on, the, identification, of, protein, coding, genes, waterbirds, such, as, pelicans, and, flamingos, for, example, may, have, in, common, specific, adaptations, suited, to, their, environment, that, were, developed, independently, birds, live, and, breed, in, most, terrestrial, habitats, and, on, all, seven, continents, reaching, their, southern, extreme, in, the, snow, petrel, s, breeding, colonies, up, to, 440, kilometres, 270, mi, inland, in, antarctica, the, highest, bird, diversity, occurs, in, tropical, regions, it, was, earlier, thought, that, this, high, diversity, was, the, result, of, higher, speciation, rates, in, the, tropics, however, studies, from, the, 2000s, found, higher, speciation, rates, in, the, high, latitudes, that, were, offset, by, greater, extinction, rates, than, in, the, tropics, many, species, migrate, annually, over, great, distances, and, across, oceans, several, families, of, birds, have, adapted, to, life, both, on, the, world, s, oceans, and, in, them, and, some, seabird, species, come, ashore, only, to, breed, while, some, penguins, have, been, recorded, diving, up, to, 300, metres, 980, ft, deep, many, bird, species, have, established, breeding, populations, in, areas, to, which, they, have, been, introduced, by, humans, some, of, these, introductions, have, been, deliberate, the, ring, necked, pheasant, for, example, has, been, introduced, around, the, world, as, a, game, bird, others, have, been, accidental, such, as, the, establishment, of, wild, monk, parakeets, in, several, north, american, cities, after, their, escape, from, captivity, some, species, including, cattle, egret, yellow, headed, caracara, and, galah, have, spread, naturally, far, beyond, their, original, ranges, as, agricultural, expansion, created, alternative, habitats, although, modern, practices, of, intensive, agriculture, have, negatively, impacted, farmland, bird, populations, compared, with, other, vertebrates, birds, have, a, body, plan, that, shows, many, unusual, adaptations, mostly, to, facilitate, flight, the, skeleton, consists, of, very, lightweight, bones, they, have, large, air, filled, cavities, called, pneumatic, cavities, which, connect, with, the, respiratory, system, the, skull, bones, in, adults, are, fused, and, do, not, show, cranial, sutures, the, orbital, cavities, that, house, the, eyeballs, are, large, and, separated, from, each, other, by, a, bony, septum, partition, the, spine, has, cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and, caudal, regions, with, the, number, of, cervical, neck, vertebrae, highly, variable, and, especially, flexible, but, movement, is, reduced, in, the, anterior, thoracic, vertebrae, and, absent, in, the, later, vertebrae, the, last, few, are, fused, with, the, pelvis, to, form, the, synsacrum, the, ribs, are, flattened, and, the, sternum, is, keeled, for, the, attachment, of, flight, muscles, except, in, the, flightless, bird, orders, the, forelimbs, are, modified, into, wings, the, wings, are, more, or, less, developed, depending, on, the, species, the, only, known, groups, that, lost, their, wings, are, the, extinct, moa, and, elephant, birds, like, the, reptiles, birds, are, primarily, uricotelic, that, is, their, kidneys, extract, nitrogenous, waste, from, their, bloodstream, and, excrete, it, as, uric, acid, instead, of, urea, or, ammonia, through, the, ureters, into, the, intestine, birds, do, not, have, a, urinary, bladder, or, external, urethral, opening, and, with, exception, of, the, ostrich, uric, acid, is, excreted, along, with, faeces, as, a, semisolid, waste, however, birds, such, as, hummingbirds, can, be, facultatively, ammonotelic, excreting, most, of, the, nitrogenous, wastes, as, ammonia, they, also, excrete, creatine, rather, than, creatinine, like, mammals, this, material, as, well, as, the, output, of, the, intestines, emerges, from, the, bird, s, cloaca, the, cloaca, is, a, multi, purpose, opening, waste, is, expelled, through, it, most, birds, mate, by, joining, cloaca, and, females, lay, eggs, from, it, in, addition, many, species, of, birds, regurgitate, pellets, it, is, a, common, but, not, universal, feature, of, altricial, passerine, nestlings, born, helpless, under, constant, parental, care, that, instead, of, excreting, directly, into, the, nest, they, produce, a, fecal, sac, this, is, a, mucus, covered, pouch, that, allows, parents, to, either, dispose, of, the, waste, outside, the, nest, or, to, recycle, the, waste, through, their, own, digestive, system, most, male, birds, do, not, have, intromittent, penises, males, within, palaeognathae, with, the, exception, of, the, kiwis, the, anseriformes, with, the, exception, of, screamers, and, in, rudimentary, forms, in, galliformes, but, fully, developed, in, cracidae, possess, a, penis, which, is, never, present, in, neoaves, its, length, is, thought, to, be, related, to, sperm, competition, and, it, fills, with, lymphatic, fluid, instead, of, blood, when, erect, when, not, copulating, it, is, hidden, within, the, proctodeum, compartment, within, the, cloaca, just, inside, the, vent, female, birds, have, sperm, storage, tubules, that, allow, sperm, to, remain, viable, long, after, copulation, a, hundred, days, in, some, species, sperm, from, multiple, males, may, compete, through, this, mechanism, most, female, birds, have, a, single, ovary, and, a, single, oviduct, both, on, the, left, side, but, there, are, exceptions, species, in, at, least, 16, different, orders, of, birds, have, two, ovaries, even, these, species, however, tend, to, have, a, single, oviduct, it, has, been, speculated, that, this, might, be, an, adaptation, to, flight, but, males, have, two, testes, and, it, is, also, observed, that, the, gonads, in, both, sexes, decrease, dramatically, in, size, outside, the, breeding, season, also, terrestrial, birds, generally, have, a, single, ovary, as, does, the, platypus, an, egg, laying, mammal, a, more, likely, explanation, is, that, the, egg, develops, a, shell, while, passing, through, the, oviduct, over, a, period, of, about, a, day, so, that, if, two, eggs, were, to, develop, at, the, same, time, there, would, be, a, risk, to, survival, while, rare, mostly, abortive, parthenogenesis, is, not, unknown, in, birds, and, eggs, can, be, diploid, automictic, and, results, in, male, offspring, birds, are, solely, gonochoric, meaning, they, have, two, sexes, either, female, or, male, the, sex, of, birds, is, determined, by, the, z, and, w, sex, chromosomes, rather, than, by, the, x, and, y, chromosomes, present, in, mammals, male, birds, have, two, z, chromosomes, zz, and, female, birds, have, a, w, chromosome, and, a, z, chromosome, wz, a, complex, system, of, disassortative, mating, with, two, morphs, is, involved, in, the, white, throated, sparrow, zonotrichia, albicollis, where, white, and, tan, browed, morphs, of, opposite, sex, pair, making, it, appear, as, if, four, sexes, were, involved, since, any, individual, is, compatible, with, only, a, fourth, of, the, population, in, nearly, all, species, of, birds, an, individual, s, sex, is, determined, at, fertilisation, however, one, 2007, study, claimed, to, demonstrate, temperature, dependent, sex, determination, among, the, australian, brushturkey, for, which, higher, temperatures, during, incubation, resulted, in, a, higher, female, to, male, sex, ratio, this, however, was, later, proven, to, not, be, the, case, these, birds, do, not, exhibit, temperature, dependent, sex, determination, but, temperature, dependent, sex, mortality, birds, have, one, of, the, most, complex, respiratory, systems, of, all, animal, groups, upon, inhalation, 75, of, the, fresh, air, bypasses, the, lungs, and, flows, directly, into, a, posterior, air, sac, which, extends, from, the, lungs, and, connects, with, air, spaces, in, the, bones, and, fills, them, with, air, the, other, 25, of, the, air, goes, directly, into, the, lungs, when, the, bird, exhales, the, used, air, flows, out, of, the, lungs, and, the, stored, fresh, air, from, the, posterior, air, sac, is, simultaneously, forced, into, the, lungs, thus, a, bird, s, lungs, receive, a, constant, supply, of, fresh, air, during, both, inhalation, and, exhalation, sound, production, is, achieved, using, the, syrinx, a, muscular, chamber, incorporating, multiple, tympanic, membranes, which, diverges, from, the, lower, end, of, the, trachea, the, trachea, being, elongated, in, some, species, increasing, the, volume, of, vocalisations, and, the, perception, of, the, bird, s, size, in, birds, the, main, arteries, taking, blood, away, from, the, heart, originate, from, the, right, aortic, arch, or, pharyngeal, arch, unlike, in, the, mammals, where, the, left, aortic, arch, forms, this, part, of, the, aorta, the, postcava, receives, blood, from, the, limbs, via, the, renal, portal, system, unlike, in, mammals, the, circulating, red, blood, cells, in, birds, retain, their, nucleus, the, avian, circulatory, system, is, driven, by, a, four, chambered, myogenic, heart, contained, in, a, fibrous, pericardial, sac, this, pericardial, sac, is, filled, with, a, serous, fluid, for, lubrication, the, heart, itself, is, divided, into, a, right, and, left, half, each, with, an, atrium, and, ventricle, the, atrium, and, ventricles, of, each, side, are, separated, by, atrioventricular, valves, which, prevent, back, flow, from, one, chamber, to, the, next, during, contraction, being, myogenic, the, heart, s, pace, is, maintained, by, pacemaker, cells, found, in, the, sinoatrial, node, located, on, the, right, atrium, the, sinoatrial, node, uses, calcium, to, cause, a, depolarising, signal, transduction, pathway, from, the, atrium, through, right, and, left, atrioventricular, bundle, which, communicates, contraction, to, the, ventricles, the, avian, heart, also, consists, of, muscular, arches, that, are, made, up, of, thick, bundles, of, muscular, layers, much, like, a, mammalian, heart, the, avian, heart, is, composed, of, endocardial, myocardial, and, epicardial, layers, the, atrium, walls, tend, to, be, thinner, than, the, ventricle, walls, due, to, the, intense, ventricular, contraction, used, to, pump, oxygenated, blood, throughout, the, body, avian, hearts, are, generally, larger, than, mammalian, hearts, when, compared, to, body, mass, this, adaptation, allows, more, blood, to, be, pumped, to, meet, the, high, metabolic, need, associated, with, flight, birds, have, a, very, efficient, system, for, diffusing, oxygen, into, the, blood, birds, have, a, ten, times, greater, surface, area, to, gas, exchange, volume, than, mammals, as, a, result, birds, have, more, blood, in, their, capillaries, per, unit, of, volume, of, lung, than, a, mammal, the, arteries, are, composed, of, thick, elastic, muscles, to, withstand, the, pressure, of, the, ventricular, contractions, and, become, more, rigid, as, they, move, away, from, the, heart, blood, moves, through, the, arteries, which, undergo, vasoconstriction, and, into, arterioles, which, act, as, a, transportation, system, to, distribute, primarily, oxygen, as, well, as, nutrients, to, all, tissues, of, the, body, as, the, arterioles, move, away, from, the, heart, and, into, individual, organs, and, tissues, they, are, further, divided, to, increase, surface, area, and, slow, blood, flow, blood, travels, through, the, arterioles, and, moves, into, the, capillaries, where, gas, exchange, can, occur, capillaries, are, organised, into, capillary, beds, in, tissues, it, is, here, that, blood, exchanges, oxygen, for, carbon, dioxide, waste, in, the, capillary, beds, blood, flow, is, slowed, to, allow, maximum, diffusion, of, oxygen, into, the, tissues, once, the, blood, has, become, deoxygenated, it, travels, through, venules, then, veins, and, back, to, the, heart, veins, unlike, arteries, are, thin, and, rigid, as, they, do, not, need, to, withstand, extreme, pressure, as, blood, travels, through, the, venules, to, the, veins, a, funneling, occurs, called, vasodilation, bringing, blood, back, to, the, heart, once, the, blood, reaches, the, heart, it, moves, first, into, the, right, atrium, then, the, right, ventricle, to, be, pumped, through, the, lungs, for, further, gas, exchange, of, carbon, dioxide, waste, for, oxygen, oxygenated, blood, then, flows, from, the, lungs, through, the, left, atrium, to, the, left, ventricle, where, it, is, pumped, out, to, the, body, the, nervous, system, is, large, relative, to, the, bird, s, size, the, most, developed, part, of, the, brain, of, birds, is, the, one, that, controls, the, flight, related, functions, while, the, cerebellum, coordinates, movement, and, the, cerebrum, controls, behaviour, patterns, navigation, mating, and, nest, building, most, birds, have, a, poor, sense, of, smell, with, notable, exceptions, including, kiwis, new, world, vultures, and, tubenoses, the, avian, visual, system, is, usually, highly, developed, water, birds, have, special, flexible, lenses, allowing, accommodation, for, vision, in, air, and, water, some, species, also, have, dual, fovea, birds, are, tetrachromatic, possessing, ultraviolet, uv, sensitive, cone, cells, in, the, eye, as, well, as, green, red, and, blue, ones, they, also, have, double, cones, likely, to, mediate, achromatic, vision, many, birds, show, plumage, patterns, in, ultraviolet, that, are, invisible, to, the, human, eye, some, birds, whose, sexes, appear, similar, to, the, naked, eye, are, distinguished, by, the, presence, of, ultraviolet, reflective, patches, on, their, feathers, male, blue, tits, have, an, ultraviolet, reflective, crown, patch, which, is, displayed, in, courtship, by, posturing, and, raising, of, their, nape, feathers, ultraviolet, light, is, also, used, in, foraging, kestrels, have, been, shown, to, search, for, prey, by, detecting, the, uv, reflective, urine, trail, marks, left, on, the, ground, by, rodents, with, the, exception, of, pigeons, and, a, few, other, species, the, eyelids, of, birds, are, not, used, in, blinking, instead, the, eye, is, lubricated, by, the, nictitating, membrane, a, third, eyelid, that, moves, horizontally, the, nictitating, membrane, also, covers, the, eye, and, acts, as, a, contact, lens, in, many, aquatic, birds, the, bird, retina, has, a, fan, shaped, blood, supply, system, called, the, pecten, eyes, of, most, birds, are, large, not, very, round, and, capable, of, only, limited, movement, in, the, orbits, typically, 10, 20, birds, with, eyes, on, the, sides, of, their, heads, have, a, wide, visual, field, while, birds, with, eyes, on, the, front, of, their, heads, such, as, owls, have, binocular, vision, and, can, estimate, the, depth, of, field, the, avian, ear, lacks, external, pinnae, but, is, covered, by, feathers, although, in, some, birds, such, as, the, asio, bubo, and, otus, owls, these, feathers, form, tufts, which, resemble, ears, the, inner, ear, has, a, cochlea, but, it, is, not, spiral, as, in, mammals, a, few, species, are, able, to, use, chemical, defences, against, predators, some, procellariiformes, can, eject, an, unpleasant, stomach, oil, against, an, aggressor, and, some, species, of, pitohuis, from, new, guinea, have, a, powerful, neurotoxin, in, their, skin, and, feathers, a, lack, of, field, observations, limit, our, knowledge, but, intraspecific, conflicts, are, known, to, sometimes, result, in, injury, or, death, the, screamers, anhimidae, some, jacanas, jacana, hydrophasianus, the, spur, winged, goose, plectropterus, the, torrent, duck, merganetta, and, nine, species, of, lapwing, vanellus, use, a, sharp, spur, on, the, wing, as, a, weapon, the, steamer, ducks, tachyeres, geese, and, swans, anserinae, the, solitaire, pezophaps, sheathbills, chionis, some, guans, crax, and, stone, curlews, burhinus, use, a, bony, knob, on, the, alular, metacarpal, to, punch, and, hammer, opponents, the, jacanas, actophilornis, and, irediparra, have, an, expanded, blade, like, radius, the, extinct, xenicibis, was, unique, in, having, an, elongate, forelimb, and, massive, hand, which, likely, functioned, in, combat, or, defence, as, a, jointed, club, or, flail, swans, for, instance, may, strike, with, the, bony, spurs, and, bite, when, defending, eggs, or, young, feathers, are, a, feature, characteristic, of, birds, though, also, present, in, some, dinosaurs, not, currently, considered, to, be, true, birds, they, facilitate, flight, provide, insulation, that, aids, in, thermoregulation, and, are, used, in, display, camouflage, and, signalling, there, are, several, types, of, feathers, each, serving, its, own, set, of, purposes, feathers, are, epidermal, growths, attached, to, the, skin, and, arise, only, in, specific, tracts, of, skin, called, pterylae, the, distribution, pattern, of, these, feather, tracts, pterylosis, is, used, in, taxonomy, and, systematics, the, arrangement, and, appearance, of, feathers, on, the, body, called, plumage, may, vary, within, species, by, age, social, status, and, sex, plumage, is, regularly, moulted, the, standard, plumage, of, a, bird, that, has, moulted, after, breeding, is, known, as, the, non, breeding, plumage, or, in, the, humphrey, parkes, terminology, basic, plumage, breeding, plumages, or, variations, of, the, basic, plumage, are, known, under, the, humphrey, parkes, system, as, alternate, plumages, moulting, is, annual, in, most, species, although, some, may, have, two, moults, a, year, and, large, birds, of, prey, may, moult, only, once, every, few, years, moulting, patterns, vary, across, species, in, passerines, flight, feathers, are, replaced, one, at, a, time, with, the, innermost, primary, being, the, first, when, the, fifth, of, sixth, primary, is, replaced, the, outermost, tertiaries, begin, to, drop, after, the, innermost, tertiaries, are, moulted, the, secondaries, starting, from, the, innermost, begin, to, drop, and, this, proceeds, to, the, outer, feathers, centrifugal, moult, the, greater, primary, coverts, are, moulted, in, synchrony, with, the, primary, that, they, overlap, a, small, number, of, species, such, as, ducks, and, geese, lose, all, of, their, flight, feathers, at, once, temporarily, becoming, flightless, as, a, general, rule, the, tail, feathers, are, moulted, and, replaced, starting, with, the, innermost, pair, centripetal, moults, of, tail, feathers, are, however, seen, in, the, phasianidae, the, centrifugal, moult, is, modified, in, the, tail, feathers, of, woodpeckers, and, treecreepers, in, that, it, begins, with, the, second, innermost, pair, of, feathers, and, finishes, with, the, central, pair, of, feathers, so, that, the, bird, maintains, a, functional, climbing, tail, the, general, pattern, seen, in, passerines, is, that, the, primaries, are, replaced, outward, secondaries, inward, and, the, tail, from, centre, outward, before, nesting, the, females, of, most, bird, species, gain, a, bare, brood, patch, by, losing, feathers, close, to, the, belly, the, skin, there, is, well, supplied, with, blood, vessels, and, helps, the, bird, in, incubation, feathers, require, maintenance, and, birds, preen, or, groom, them, daily, spending, an, average, of, around, 9, of, their, daily, time, on, this, the, bill, is, used, to, brush, away, foreign, particles, and, to, apply, waxy, secretions, from, the, uropygial, gland, these, secretions, protect, the, feathers, flexibility, and, act, as, an, antimicrobial, agent, inhibiting, the, growth, of, feather, degrading, bacteria, this, may, be, supplemented, with, the, secretions, of, formic, acid, from, ants, which, birds, receive, through, a, behaviour, known, as, anting, to, remove, feather, parasites, the, scales, of, birds, are, composed, of, the, same, keratin, as, beaks, claws, and, spurs, they, are, found, mainly, on, the, toes, and, metatarsus, but, may, be, found, further, up, on, the, ankle, in, some, birds, most, bird, scales, do, not, overlap, significantly, except, in, the, cases, of, kingfishers, and, woodpeckers, the, scales, of, birds, are, thought, to, be, homologous, to, those, of, reptiles, and, mammals, most, birds, can, fly, which, distinguishes, them, from, almost, all, other, vertebrate, classes, flight, is, the, primary, means, of, locomotion, for, most, bird, species, and, is, used, for, searching, for, food, and, for, escaping, from, predators, birds, have, various, adaptations, for, flight, including, a, lightweight, skeleton, two, large, flight, muscles, the, pectoralis, which, accounts, for, 15, of, the, total, mass, of, the, bird, and, the, supracoracoideus, as, well, as, a, modified, forelimb, wing, that, serves, as, an, aerofoil, wing, shape, and, size, generally, determine, a, bird, s, flight, style, and, performance, many, birds, combine, powered, flapping, flight, with, less, energy, intensive, soaring, flight, about, 60, extant, bird, species, are, flightless, as, were, many, extinct, birds, flightlessness, often, arises, in, birds, on, isolated, islands, most, likely, due, to, limited, resources, and, the, absence, of, mammalian, land, predators, flightlessness, is, almost, exclusively, correlated, with, gigantism, due, to, an, island, s, inherent, condition, of, isolation, although, flightless, penguins, use, similar, musculature, and, movements, to, fly, through, the, water, as, do, some, flight, capable, birds, such, as, auks, shearwaters, and, dippers, most, birds, are, diurnal, but, some, birds, such, as, many, species, of, owls, and, nightjars, are, nocturnal, or, crepuscular, active, during, twilight, hours, and, many, coastal, waders, feed, when, the, tides, are, appropriate, by, day, or, night, birds, diets, are, varied, and, often, include, nectar, fruit, plants, seeds, carrion, and, various, small, animals, including, other, birds, the, digestive, system, of, birds, is, unique, with, a, crop, for, storage, and, a, gizzard, that, contains, swallowed, stones, for, grinding, food, to, compensate, for, the, lack, of, teeth, some, species, such, as, pigeons, and, some, psittacine, species, do, not, have, a, gallbladder, most, birds, are, highly, adapted, for, rapid, digestion, to, aid, with, flight, some, migratory, birds, have, adapted, to, use, protein, stored, in, many, parts, of, their, bodies, including, protein, from, the, intestines, as, additional, energy, during, migration, birds, that, employ, many, strategies, to, obtain, food, or, feed, on, a, variety, of, food, items, are, called, generalists, while, others, that, concentrate, time, and, effort, on, specific, food, items, or, have, a, single, strategy, to, obtain, food, are, considered, specialists, avian, foraging, strategies, can, vary, widely, by, species, many, birds, glean, for, insects, invertebrates, fruit, or, seeds, some, hunt, insects, by, suddenly, attacking, from, a, branch, those, species, that, seek, pest, insects, are, considered, beneficial, biological, control, agents, and, their, presence, encouraged, in, biological, pest, control, programmes, combined, insectivorous, birds, eat, 400, 500, million, metric, tons, of, arthropods, annually, nectar, feeders, such, as, hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and, lorikeets, amongst, others, have, specially, adapted, brushy, tongues, and, in, many, cases, bills, designed, to, fit, co, adapted, flowers, kiwis, and, shorebirds, with, long, bills, probe, for, invertebrates, shorebirds, varied, bill, lengths, and, feeding, methods, result, in, the, separation, of, ecological, niches, loons, diving, ducks, penguins, and, auks, pursue, their, prey, underwater, using, their, wings, or, feet, for, propulsion, while, aerial, predators, such, as, sulids, kingfishers, and, terns, plunge, dive, after, their, prey, flamingos, three, species, of, prion, and, some, ducks, are, filter, feeders, geese, and, dabbling, ducks, are, primarily, grazers, some, species, including, frigatebirds, gulls, and, skuas, engage, in, kleptoparasitism, stealing, food, items, from, other, birds, kleptoparasitism, is, thought, to, be, a, supplement, to, food, obtained, by, hunting, rather, than, a, significant, part, of, any, species, diet, a, study, of, great, frigatebirds, stealing, from, masked, boobies, estimated, that, the, frigatebirds, stole, at, most, 40, of, their, food, and, on, average, stole, only, 5, other, birds, are, scavengers, some, of, these, like, vultures, are, specialised, carrion, eaters, while, others, like, gulls, corvids, or, other, birds, of, prey, are, opportunists, water, is, needed, by, many, birds, although, their, mode, of, excretion, and, lack, of, sweat, glands, reduces, the, physiological, demands, some, desert, birds, can, obtain, their, water, needs, entirely, from, moisture, in, their, food, some, have, other, adaptations, such, as, allowing, their, body, temperature, to, rise, saving, on, moisture, loss, from, evaporative, cooling, or, panting, seabirds, can, drink, seawater, and, have, salt, glands, inside, the, head, that, eliminate, excess, salt, out, of, the, nostrils, most, birds, scoop, water, in, their, beaks, and, raise, their, head, to, let, water, run, down, the, throat, some, species, especially, of, arid, zones, belonging, to, the, pigeon, finch, mousebird, button, quail, and, bustard, families, are, capable, of, sucking, up, water, without, the, need, to, tilt, back, their, heads, some, desert, birds, depend, on, water, sources, and, sandgrouse, are, particularly, well, known, for, congregating, daily, at, waterholes, nesting, sandgrouse, and, many, plovers, carry, water, to, their, young, by, wetting, their, belly, feathers, some, birds, carry, water, for, chicks, at, the, nest, in, their, crop, or, regurgitate, it, along, with, food, the, pigeon, family, flamingos, and, penguins, have, adaptations, to, produce, a, nutritive, fluid, called, crop, milk, that, they, provide, to, their, chicks, feathers, being, critical, to, the, survival, of, a, bird, require, maintenance, apart, from, physical, wear, and, tear, feathers, face, the, onslaught, of, fungi, ectoparasitic, feather, mites, and, bird, lice, the, physical, condition, of, feathers, are, maintained, by, preening, often, with, the, application, of, secretions, from, the, preen, gland, birds, also, bathe, in, water, or, dust, themselves, while, some, birds, dip, into, shallow, water, more, aerial, species, may, make, aerial, dips, into, water, and, arboreal, species, often, make, use, of, dew, or, rain, that, collect, on, leaves, birds, of, arid, regions, make, use, of, loose, soil, to, dust, bathe, a, behaviour, termed, as, anting, in, which, the, bird, encourages, ants, to, run, through, their, plumage, is, also, thought, to, help, them, reduce, the, ectoparasite, load, in, feathers, many, species, will, spread, out, their, wings, and, expose, them, to, direct, sunlight, and, this, too, is, thought, to, help, in, reducing, fungal, and, ectoparasitic, activity, that, may, lead, to, feather, damage, many, bird, species, migrate, to, take, advantage, of, global, differences, of, seasonal, temperatures, therefore, optimising, availability, of, food, sources, and, breeding, habitat, these, migrations, vary, among, the, different, groups, many, landbirds, shorebirds, and, waterbirds, undertake, annual, long, distance, migrations, usually, triggered, by, the, length, of, daylight, as, well, as, weather, conditions, these, birds, are, characterised, by, a, breeding, season, spent, in, the, temperate, or, polar, regions, and, a, non, breeding, season, in, the, tropical, regions, or, opposite, hemisphere, before, migration, birds, substantially, increase, body, fats, and, reserves, and, reduce, the, size, of, some, of, their, organs, migration, is, highly, demanding, energetically, particularly, as, birds, need, to, cross, deserts, and, oceans, without, refuelling, landbirds, have, a, flight, range, of, around, 2, 500, km, 1, 600, mi, and, shorebirds, can, fly, up, to, 4, 000, km, 2, 500, mi, although, the, bar, tailed, godwit, is, capable, of, non, stop, flights, of, up, to, 10, 200, km, 6, 300, mi, some, seabirds, undertake, long, migrations, with, the, longest, annual, migrations, including, those, of, arctic, terns, which, were, recorded, travelling, an, average, of, 70, 900, km, 44, 100, mi, between, their, arctic, breeding, grounds, in, greenland, and, iceland, and, their, wintering, grounds, in, antarctica, with, one, bird, covering, 81, 600, km, 50, 700, mi, and, sooty, shearwaters, which, nest, in, new, zealand, and, chile, and, make, annual, round, trips, of, 64, 000, km, 39, 800, mi, to, their, summer, feeding, grounds, in, the, north, pacific, off, japan, alaska, and, california, other, seabirds, disperse, after, breeding, travelling, widely, but, having, no, set, migration, route, albatrosses, nesting, in, the, southern, ocean, often, undertake, circumpolar, trips, between, breeding, seasons, some, bird, species, undertake, shorter, migrations, travelling, only, as, far, as, is, required, to, avoid, bad, weather, or, obtain, food, irruptive, species, such, as, the, boreal, finches, are, one, such, group, and, can, commonly, be, found, at, a, location, in, one, year, and, absent, the, next, this, type, of, migration, is, normally, associated, with, food, availability, species, may, also, travel, shorter, distances, over, part, of, their, range, with, individuals, from, higher, latitudes, travelling, into, the, existing, range, of, conspecifics, others, undertake, partial, migrations, where, only, a, fraction, of, the, population, usually, females, and, subdominant, males, migrates, partial, migration, can, form, a, large, percentage, of, the, migration, behaviour, of, birds, in, some, regions, in, australia, surveys, found, that, 44, of, non, passerine, birds, and, 32, of, passerines, were, partially, migratory, altitudinal, migration, is, a, form, of, short, distance, migration, in, which, birds, spend, the, breeding, season, at, higher, altitudes, and, move, to, lower, ones, during, suboptimal, conditions, it, is, most, often, triggered, by, temperature, changes, and, usually, occurs, when, the, normal, territories, also, become, inhospitable, due, to, lack, of, food, some, species, may, also, be, nomadic, holding, no, fixed, territory, and, moving, according, to, weather, and, food, availability, parrots, as, a, family, are, overwhelmingly, neither, migratory, nor, sedentary, but, considered, to, either, be, dispersive, irruptive, nomadic, or, undertake, small, and, irregular, migrations, the, ability, of, birds, to, return, to, precise, locations, across, vast, distances, has, been, known, for, some, time, in, an, experiment, conducted, in, the, 1950s, a, manx, shearwater, released, in, boston, in, the, united, states, returned, to, its, colony, in, skomer, in, wales, within, 13, days, a, distance, of, 5, 150, km, 3, 200, mi, birds, navigate,

compensate, for, the, changing, position, of, the, sun, during, the, day, by, the, use, of, an, internal, clock, orientation, with, the, stellar, compass, depends, on, the, position, of, the, constellations, surrounding, polaris, these, are, backed, up, in, some, species, by, their, ability, to, sense, the, earth, s, geomagnetism, through, specialised, photoreceptors, birds, communicate, primarily, using, visual, and, auditory, signals, signals, can, be, interspecific, between, species, and, intraspecific, within, species, birds, sometimes, use, plumage, to, assess, and, assert, social, dominance, to, display, breeding, condition, in, sexually, selected, species, or, to, make, threatening, displays, as, in, the, sunbittern, s, mimicry, of, a, large, predator, to, ward, off, hawks, and, protect, young, chicks, visual, communication, among, birds, may, also, involve, ritualised, displays, which, have, developed, from, non, signalling, actions, such, as, preening, the, adjustments, of, feather, position, pecking, or, other, behaviour, these, displays, may, signal, aggression, or, submission, or, may, contribute, to, the, formation, of, pair, bonds, the, most, elaborate, displays, occur, during, courtship, where, dances, are, often, formed, from, complex, combinations, of, many, possible, component, movements, males, breeding, success, may, depend, on, the, quality, of, such, displays, bird, calls, and, songs, which, are, produced, in, the, syrinx, are, the, major, means, by, which, birds, communicate, with, sound, this, communication, can, be, very, complex, some, species, can, operate, the, two, sides, of, the, syrinx, independently, allowing, the, simultaneous, production, of, two, different, songs, calls, are, used, for, a, variety, of, purposes, including, mate, attraction, evaluation, of, potential, mates, bond, formation, the, claiming, and, maintenance, of, territories, the, identification, of, other, individuals, such, as, when, parents, look, for, chicks, in, colonies, or, when, mates, reunite, at, the, start, of, breeding, season, and, the, warning, of, other, birds, of, potential, predators, sometimes, with, specific, information, about, the, nature, of, the, threat, some, birds, also, use, mechanical, sounds, for, auditory, communication, the, coenocorypha, snipes, of, new, zealand, drive, air, through, their, feathers, woodpeckers, drum, for, long, distance, communication, and, palm, cockatoos, use, tools, to, drum, while, some, birds, are, essentially, territorial, or, live, in, small, family, groups, other, birds, may, form, large, flocks, the, principal, benefits, of, flocking, are, safety, in, numbers, and, increased, foraging, efficiency, defence, against, predators, is, particularly, important, in, closed, habitats, like, forests, where, ambush, predation, is, common, and, multiple, eyes, can, provide, a, valuable, early, warning, system, this, has, led, to, the, development, of, many, mixed, species, feeding, flocks, which, are, usually, composed, of, small, numbers, of, many, species, these, flocks, provide, safety, in, numbers, but, increase, potential, competition, for, resources, costs, of, flocking, include, bullying, of, socially, subordinate, birds, by, more, dominant, birds, and, the, reduction, of, feeding, efficiency, in, certain, cases, some, species, have, a, mixed, system, with, breeding, pairs, maintaining, territories, while, unmated, or, young, birds, live, in, flocks, where, they, secure, mates, prior, to, finding, territories, birds, sometimes, also, form, associations, with, non, avian, species, plunge, diving, seabirds, associate, with, dolphins, and, tuna, which, push, shoaling, fish, towards, the, surface, some, species, of, hornbills, have, a, mutualistic, relationship, with, dwarf, mongooses, in, which, they, forage, together, and, warn, each, other, of, nearby, birds, of, prey, and, other, predators, the, high, metabolic, rates, of, birds, during, the, active, part, of, the, day, is, supplemented, by, rest, at, other, times, sleeping, birds, often, use, a, type, of, sleep, known, as, vigilant, sleep, where, periods, of, rest, are, interspersed, with, quick, eye, opening, peeks, allowing, them, to, be, sensitive, to, disturbances, and, enable, rapid, escape, from, threats, swifts, are, believed, to, be, able, to, sleep, in, flight, and, radar, observations, suggest, that, they, orient, themselves, to, face, the, wind, in, their, roosting, flight, it, has, been, suggested, that, there, may, be, certain, kinds, of, sleep, which, are, possible, even, when, in, flight, some, birds, have, also, demonstrated, the, capacity, to, fall, into, slow, wave, sleep, one, hemisphere, of, the, brain, at, a, time, the, birds, tend, to, exercise, this, ability, depending, upon, its, position, relative, to, the, outside, of, the, flock, this, may, allow, the, eye, opposite, the, sleeping, hemisphere, to, remain, vigilant, for, predators, by, viewing, the, outer, margins, of, the, flock, this, adaptation, is, also, known, from, marine, mammals, communal, roosting, is, common, because, it, lowers, the, loss, of, body, heat, and, decreases, the, risks, associated, with, predators, roosting, sites, are, often, chosen, with, regard, to, thermoregulation, and, safety, unusual, mobile, roost, sites, include, large, herbivores, on, the, african, savanna, that, are, used, by, oxpeckers, many, sleeping, birds, bend, their, heads, over, their, backs, and, tuck, their, bills, in, their, back, feathers, although, others, place, their, beaks, among, their, breast, feathers, many, birds, rest, on, one, leg, while, some, may, pull, up, their, legs, into, their, feathers, especially, in, cold, weather, perching, birds, have, a, tendon, locking, mechanism, that, helps, them, hold, on, to, the, perch, when, they, are, asleep, many, ground, birds, such, as, quails, and, pheasants, roost, in, trees, a, few, parrots, of, the, genus, loriculus, roost, hanging, upside, down, some, hummingbirds, go, into, a, nightly, state, of, torpor, accompanied, with, a, reduction, of, their, metabolic, rates, this, physiological, adaptation, shows, in, nearly, a, hundred, other, species, including, owlet, nightjars, nightjars, and, woodswallows, one, species, the, common, poorwill, even, enters, a, state, of, hibernation, birds, do, not, have, sweat, glands, but, can, lose, water, directly, through, the, skin, and, they, may, cool, themselves, by, moving, to, shade, standing, in, water, panting, increasing, their, surface, area, fluttering, their, throat, or, using, special, behaviours, like, urohidrosis, to, cool, themselves, ninety, five, per, cent, of, bird, species, are, socially, monogamous, these, species, pair, for, at, least, the, length, of, the, breeding, season, or, in, some, cases, for, several, years, or, until, the, death, of, one, mate, monogamy, allows, for, both, paternal, care, and, biparental, care, which, is, especially, important, for, species, in, which, care, from, both, the, female, and, the, male, parent, is, required, in, order, to, successfully, rear, a, brood, among, many, socially, monogamous, species, extra, pair, copulation, infidelity, is, common, such, behaviour, typically, occurs, between, dominant, males, and, females, paired, with, subordinate, males, but, may, also, be, the, result, of, forced, copulation, in, ducks, and, other, anatids, for, females, possible, benefits, of, extra, pair, copulation, include, getting, better, genes, for, her, offspring, and, insuring, against, the, possibility, of, infertility, in, her, mate, males, of, species, that, engage, in, extra, pair, copulations, will, closely, guard, their, mates, to, ensure, the, parentage, of, the, offspring, that, they, raise, other, mating, systems, including, polygyny, polyandry, polygamy, polygynandry, and, promiscuity, also, occur, polygamous,

be, driven, by, environmental, conditions, a, unique, system, is, the, formation, of, trios, where, a, third, individual, is, allowed, by, a, breeding, pair, temporarily, into, the, territory, to, assist, with, brood, raising, thereby, leading, to, higher, fitness, breeding, usually, involves, some, form, of, courtship, display, typically, performed, by, the, male, most, displays, are, rather, simple, and, involve, some, type, of, song, some, displays, however, are, quite, elaborate, depending, on, the, species, these, may, include, wing, or, tail, drumming, dancing, aerial, flights, or, communal, lekking, females, are, generally, the, ones, that, drive, partner, selection, although, in, the, polyandrous, phalaropes, this, is, reversed, plainer, males, choose, brightly, coloured, females, courtship, feeding, billing, and, allopreening, are, commonly, performed, between, partners, generally, after, the, birds, have, paired, and, mated, homosexual, behaviour, has, been,

their, eggs, to, those, of, their, hosts, bird, eggs, are, usually, laid, in, a, nest, most, species, create, somewhat, elaborate, nests, which, can, be, cups, domes, plates, mounds, or, burrows, some, bird, nests, can, be, a, simple, scrape, with, minimal, or, no, lining, most, seabird, and, wader, nests, are, no, more, than, a, scrape, on, the, ground, most, birds, build, nests, in, sheltered, hidden, areas, to, avoid, predation, but, large, or, colonial, birds, which, are, more, capable, of, defence, may, build, more, open, nests, during, nest, construction, some, species, seek, out, plant, matter, from, plants, with, parasite, reducing, toxins, to, improve, chick, survival, and, feathers, are, often, used, for, nest, insulation, some, bird, species, have, no, nests, the, cliff, nesting, common, guillemot, lays, its, eggs, on, bare, rock, and, male, emperor, penguins, keep, eggs, between, their, body, and, feet, the, absence, of, nests, is, especially, prevalent, in, open, habitat, ground, nesting, species, where, any, addition, of, nest, material, would, make, the, nest, more, conspicuous, many, ground, nesting, birds, lay, a, clutch, of, eggs, that, hatch, synchronously, with, precocial, chicks, led, away, from, the, nests, nidifugous, by, their, parents, soon, after, hatching, incubation, which, regulates, temperature, for, chick, development, usually,

table, below, at, the, time, of, their, hatching, chicks, range, in, development, from, helpless, to, independent, depending, on, their, species, helpless, chicks, are, termed, altricial, and, tend, to, be, born, small, blind, immobile, and, naked, chicks, that, are, mobile, and, feathered, upon, hatching, are, termed, precocial, altricial, chicks, need, help, thermoregulating, and, must, be, brooded, for, longer, than, precocial, chicks, the, young, of, many, bird, species, do, not, precisely, fit, into, either, the, precocial, or, altricial, category, having, some, aspects, of, each, and, thus, fall, somewhere, on, an, altricial, precocial, spectrum, chicks, at, neither, extreme, but, favouring, one, or, the, other, may, be, termed, semi, precocial, or, semi, altricial, the, length, and, nature, of, parental, care, varies, widely, amongst, different, orders, and, species, at, one, extreme, parental, care, in, megapodes, ends, at, hatching, the, newly, hatched, chick, digs, itself, out, of, the, nest, mound, without, parental, assistance, and, can, fend, for, itself, immediately, at, the, other, extreme, many, seabirds, have, extended, periods, of, parental, care, the, longest, being, that, of, the, great, frigatebird, whose, chicks, take, up, to, six, months, to, fledge, and, are, fed, by, the, parents, for, up, to, an, additional, 14, months, the, chick, guard, stage, describes, the, period, of, breeding, during, which, one, of, the, adult, birds, is, permanently, present, at, the, nest, after, chicks, have, hatched, the, main, purpose, of, the, guard, stage, is, to, aid, offspring, to, thermoregulate, and, protect, them, from, predation, in, some, species, both, parents, care, for, nestlings, and, fledglings, in, others, such, care, is, the, responsibility, of, only, one, sex, in, some, species, other, members, of, the, same, species, usually, close, relatives, of, the, breeding, pair, such, as, offspring, from, previous, broods, will, help, with, the, raising, of, the, young, such, alloparenting, is, particularly, common, among, the, corvida, which, includes, such, birds, as, the, true, crows, australian, magpie, and, fairy, wrens, but, has, been, observed, in, species, as, different, as, the, rifleman, and, red, kite, among, most, groups, of, animals, male, parental, care, is, rare, in, birds, however, it, is, quite, common, more, so, than, in, any, other, vertebrate, class, although, territory, and, nest, site, defence, incubation, and, chick, feeding, are, often, shared, tasks, there, is, sometimes, a, division, of, labour, in, which, one, mate, undertakes, all, or, most, of, a, particular, duty, the, point, at, which, chicks, fledge, varies, dramatically, the, chicks, of, the, synthliboramphus, murrelets, like, the, ancient, murrelet, leave, the, nest, the, night, after, they, hatch, following, their, parents, out, to, sea, where, they, are, raised, away, from, terrestrial, predators, some, other, species, such, as, ducks, move, their, chicks, away, from, the, nest, at, an, early, age, in, most, species, chicks, leave, the, nest, just, before, or, soon, after, they, are, able, to, fly, the, amount, of, parental, care, after, fledging, varies, albatross, chicks, leave, the, nest, on, their, own, and, receive, no, further, help, while, other, species, continue, some, supplementary, feeding, after, fledging, chicks, may, also, follow, their, parents, during, their, first, migration, brood, parasitism, in, which, an, egg, layer, leaves, her, eggs, with, another, individual, s, brood, is, more, common, among, birds, than, any, other, type, of, organism, after, a, parasitic, bird, lays, her, eggs, in, another, bird, s, nest, they, are, often, accepted, and, raised, by, the, host, at, the, expense, of, the, host, s, own, brood, brood, parasites, may, be, either, obligate, brood, parasites, which, must, lay, their, eggs, in, the, nests, of, other, species, because, they, are, incapable, of, raising, their, own, young, or, non, obligate, brood, parasites, which, sometimes, lay, eggs, in, the, nests, of, conspecifics, to, increase, their, reproductive, output, even, though, they, could, have, raised, their, own, young, one, hundred, bird, species, including, honeyguides, icterids, and, ducks, are, obligate, parasites, though, the, most, famous, are, the, cuckoos, some, brood, parasites, are, adapted, to, hatch, before, their, host, s, young, which, allows, them, to, destroy, the, host, s, eggs, by, pushing, them, out, of, the, nest, or, to, kill, the, host, s, chicks, this, ensures, that, all, food, brought, to, the, nest, will, be, fed, to, the, parasitic, chicks, birds, have, evolved, a, variety, of, mating, behaviours, with, the, peacock, tail, being, perhaps, the, most, famous, example, of, sexual, selection, and, the, fisherian, runaway, commonly, occurring, sexual, dimorphisms, such, as, size, and, colour, differences, are, energetically, costly, attributes, that, signal, competitive, breeding, situations, many, types, of, avian, sexual, selection, have, been, identified, intersexual, selection, also, known, as, female, choice, and, intrasexual, competition, where, individuals, of, the, more, abundant, sex, compete, with, each, other, for, the, privilege, to, mate, sexually, selected, traits, often, evolve, to, become, more,
