an, earthworm, is, a, soil, dwelling, terrestrial, invertebrate, that, belongs, to, the, phylum, annelida, the, term, is, the, common, name, for, the, largest, members, of, the, class, or, subclass, depending, on, the, author, oligochaeta, in, classical, systems, they, were, in, the, order, of, opisthopora, since, the, male, pores, opened, posterior, to, the, female, pores, although, the, internal, male, segments, are, anterior, to, the, female, theoretical, cladistic, studies, have, placed, them, in, the, suborder, lumbricina, of, the, order, haplotaxida, but, this, may, change, other, slang, names, for, earthworms, include, dew, worm, rainworm, nightcrawler, and, angleworm, from, its, use, as, angling, hookbaits, larger, terrestrial, earthworms, are, also, called, megadriles, which, translates, to, big, worms, as, opposed, to, the, microdriles, small, worms, in, the, semiaquatic, families, tubificidae, lumbricidae, and, enchytraeidae, the, megadriles, are, characterized, by, a, distinct, clitellum, more, extensive, than, that, of, microdriles, and, a, vascular, system, with, true, capillaries, earthworms, are, commonly, found, in, moist, compost, rich, soil, eating, a, wide, variety, of, organic, matters, which, include, detritus, living, protozoa, rotifers, nematodes, bacteria, fungi, and, other, microorganisms, an, earthworm, s, digestive, system, runs, the, length, of, its, body, they, are, one, of, nature, s, most, important, detritivores, and, coprophages, and, also, serve, as, food, for, many, low, level, consumers, within, the, ecosystems, earthworms, exhibit, an, externally, segmented, tube, within, a, tube, body, plan, with, corresponding, internal, segmentations, and, usually, have, setae, on, all, segments, they, have, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, wherever, soil, water, and, temperature, conditions, allow, they, have, a, double, transport, system, made, of, coelomic, fluid, that, moves, within, the, fluid, filled, coelom, and, a, simple, closed, circulatory, system, and, respire, breathe, via, cutaneous, respiration, as, soft, bodied, invertebrates, they, lack, a, true, skeleton, but, their, structure, is, maintained, by, fluid, filled, coelom, chambers, that, function, as, a, hydrostatic, skeleton, earthworms, have, a, central, nervous, system, consisting, of, two, ganglia, above, the, mouth, one, on, either, side, connected, to, an, axial, nerve, running, along, its, length, to, motor, neurons, and, sensory, cells, in, each, segment, large, numbers, of, chemoreceptors, concentrate, near, its, mouth, circumferential, and, longitudinal, muscles, edging, each, segment, let, the, worm, move, similar, sets, of, muscles, line, the, gut, tube, and, their, actions, propel, digested, food, toward, the, worm, s, anus, earthworms, are, hermaphrodites, each, worm, carries, male, and, female, reproductive, organs, and, genital, pores, when, mating, two, individual, earthworms, will, exchange, sperm, and, fertilize, each, other, s, ova, depending, on, the, species, an, adult, earthworm, can, be, from, 10, mm, 0, 39, in, long, and, 1, mm, 0, 039, in, wide, to, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, long, and, over, 25, mm, 0, 98, in, wide, but, the, typical, lumbricus, terrestris, grows, to, about, 360, mm, 14, in, long, probably, the, longest, worm, on, confirmed, records, is, amynthas, mekongianus, that, extends, up, to, 3, m, 10, ft, in, the, mud, along, the, banks, of, the, 4, 350, km, 2, 703, mi, mekong, river, in, southeast, asia, from, front, to, back, the, basic, shape, of, the, earthworm, is, a, cylindrical, tube, in, a, tube, divided, into, a, series, of, segments, called, metameres, that, compartmentalize, the, body, furrows, are, generally, externally, visible, on, the, body, demarking, the, segments, dorsal, pores, and, nephridiopores, exude, a, fluid, that, moistens, and, protects, the, worm, s, surface, allowing, it, to, breathe, except, for, the, mouth, and, anal, segments, each, segment, carries, bristlelike, hairs, called, lateral, setae, used, to, anchor, parts, of, the, body, during, movement, species, may, have, four, pairs, of, setae, on, each, segment, or, more, than, eight, sometimes, forming, a, complete, circle, of, setae, per, segment, special, ventral, setae, are, used, to, anchor, mating, earthworms, by, their, penetration, into, the, bodies, of, their, mates, generally, within, a, species, the, number, of, segments, found, is, consistent, across, specimens, and, individuals, are, born, with, the, number, of, segments, they, will, have, throughout, their, lives, the, first, body, segment, segment, number, 1, features, both, the, earthworm, s, mouth, and, overhanging, the, mouth, a, fleshy, lobe, called, the, prostomium, which, seals, the, entrance, when, the, worm, is, at, rest, but, is, also, used, to, feel, and, chemically, sense, the, worm, s, surroundings, some, species, of, earthworm, can, even, use, the, prehensile, prostomium, to, grab, and, drag, items, such, as, grasses, and, leaves, into, their, burrow, an, adult, earthworm, develops, a, belt, shaped, glandular, swelling, called, the, clitellum, which, covers, several, segments, toward, the, front, part, of, the, animal, this, is, part, of, the, reproductive, system, and, produces, egg, capsules, the, posterior, is, most, commonly, cylindrical, like, the, rest, of, the, body, but, depending, on, the, species, it, may, also, be, quadrangular, octagonal, trapezoidal, or, flattened, the, last, segment, is, called, the, periproct, the, earthworm, s, anus, a, short, vertical, slit, is, found, on, this, segment, the, exterior, of, an, individual, segment, is, a, thin, cuticle, over, the, skin, commonly, pigmented, red, to, brown, which, has, specialized, cells, that, secrete, mucus, over, the, cuticle, to, keep, the, body, moist, and, ease, movement, through, the, soil, under, the, skin, is, a, layer, of, nerve, tissue, and, two, layers, of, muscles, a, thin, outer, layer, of, circular, muscle, and, a, much, thicker, inner, layer, of, longitudinal, muscle, interior, to, the, muscle, layer, is, a, fluid, filled, chamber, called, a, coelom, that, by, its, pressurization, provides, structure, to, the, worm, s, boneless, body, the, segments, are, separated, from, each, other, by, septa, the, plural, of, septum, which, are, perforated, transverse, walls, allowing, the, coelomic, fluid, to, pass, between, segments, a, pair, of, structures, called, nephrostomes, are, located, at, the, back, of, each, septum, a, nephric, tubule, leads, from, each, nephrostome, through, the, septum, and, into, the, following, segment, this, tubule, then, leads, to, the, main, body, fluid, filtering, organ, the, nephridium, or, metanephridium, which, removes, metabolic, waste, from, the, coelomic, fluid, and, expels, it, through, pores, called, nephridiopores, on, the, worm, s, sides, usually, two, nephridia, sometimes, more, are, found, in, most, segments, at, the, centre, of, a, worm, is, the, digestive, tract, which, runs, straight, through, from, mouth, to, anus, without, coiling, and, is, flanked, above, and, below, by, blood, vessels, the, dorsal, blood, vessel, and, the, ventral, blood, vessel, as, well, as, a, subneural, blood, vessel, and, the, ventral, nerve, cord, and, is, surrounded, in, each, segment, by, a, pair, of, pallial, blood, vessels, that, connect, the, dorsal, to, the, subneural, blood, vessels, many, earthworms, can, eject, coelomic, fluid, through, pores, in, the, back, in, response, to, stress, the, australian, didymogaster, sylvaticus, known, as, the, blue, squirter, earthworm, can, squirt, fluid, as, high, as, 30, cm, 12, in, the, cns, consists, of, a, bilobed, brain, cerebral, ganglia, or, supra, pharyngeal, ganglion, sub, pharyngeal, ganglia, circum, pharyngeal, connectives, and, a, ventral, nerve, cord, earthworms, brains, consist, of, a, pair, of, pear, shaped, cerebral, ganglia, these, are, located, in, the, dorsal, side, of, the, alimentary, canal, in, the, third, segment, in, a, groove, between, the, buccal, cavity, and, pharynx, a, pair, of, circum, pharyngeal, connectives, from, the, brain, encircle, the, pharynx, and, then, connect, with, a, pair, of, sub, pharyngeal, ganglia, located, below, the, pharynx, in, the, fourth, segment, this, arrangement, means, the, brain, sub, pharyngeal, ganglia, and, the, circum, pharyngeal, connectives, form, a, nerve, ring, around, the, pharynx, the, ventral, nerve, cord, formed, by, nerve, cells, and, nerve, fibers, begins, at, the, sub, pharyngeal, ganglia, and, extends, below, the, alimentary, canal, to, the, most, posterior, body, segment, the, ventral, nerve, cord, has, a, swelling, or, ganglion, in, each, segment, i, e, a, segmental, ganglion, which, occurs, from, the, fifth, to, the, last, segment, of, the, body, there, are, also, three, giant, axons, one, medial, giant, axon, mga, and, two, lateral, giant, axons, lgas, on, the, mid, dorsal, side, of, the, ventral, nerve, cord, the, mga, is, 0, 07, mm, in, diameter, and, transmits, in, an, anterior, posterior, direction, at, a, rate, of, 32, 2, m, s, the, lgas, are, slightly, narrower, at, 0, 05, mm, in, diameter, and, transmit, in, a, posterior, anterior, direction, at, 12, 6, m, s, the, two, lgas, are, connected, at, regular, intervals, along, the, body, and, are, therefore, considered, one, giant, axon, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, consists, of, nerve, plexuses, in, the, epidermis, and, alimentary, canal, a, plexus, is, a, web, of, connected, nerve, cells, the, nerves, that, run, along, the, body, wall, pass, between, the, outer, circular, and, inner, longitudinal, muscle, layers, of, the, wall, they, give, off, branches, that, form, the, intermuscular, plexus, and, the, subepidermal, plexus, these, nerves, connect, with, the, cricopharyngeal, connective, on, the, surface, crawling, speed, varies, both, within, and, among, individuals, earthworms, crawl, faster, primarily, by, taking, longer, strides, and, a, greater, frequency, of, strides, larger, lumbricus, terrestris, worms, crawl, at, a, greater, absolute, speed, than, smaller, worms, they, achieve, this, by, taking, slightly, longer, strides, but, with, slightly, lower, stride, frequencies, touching, an, earthworm, which, causes, a, pressure, response, as, well, as, often, a, response, to, the, dehydrating, quality, of, the, salt, on, human, skin, toxic, to, earthworms, stimulates, the, subepidermal, nerve, plexus, which, connects, to, the, intermuscular, plexus, and, causes, the, longitudinal, muscles, to, contract, this, causes, the, writhing, movements, observed, when, a, human, picks, up, an, earthworm, this, behaviour, is, a, reflex, and, does, not, require, the, cns, it, occurs, even, if, the, nerve, cord, is, removed, each, segment, of, the, earthworm, has, its, own, nerve, plexus, the, plexus, of, one, segment, is, not, connected, directly, to, that, of, adjacent, segments, the, nerve, cord, is, required, to, connect, the, nervous, systems, of, the, segments, the, giant, axons, carry, the, fastest, signals, along, the, nerve, cord, these, are, emergency, signals, that, initiate, reflex, escape, behaviours, the, larger, dorsal, giant, axon, conducts, signals, the, fastest, from, the, rear, to, the, front, of, the, animal, if, the, rear, of, the, worm, is, touched, a, signal, is, rapidly, sent, forwards, causing, the, longitudinal, muscles, in, each, segment, to, contract, this, causes, the, worm, to, shorten, very, quickly, as, an, attempt, to, escape, from, a, predator, or, other, potential, threat, the, two, medial, giant, axons, connect, with, each, other, and, send, signals, from, the, front, to, the, rear, stimulation, of, these, causes, the, earthworm, to, very, quickly, retreat, perhaps, contracting, into, its, burrow, to, escape, a, bird, the, presence, of, a, nervous, system, is, essential, for, an, animal, to, be, able, to, experience, nociception, or, pain, however, other, physiological, capacities, are, also, required, such, as, opioid, sensitivity, and, central, modulation, of, responses, by, analgesics, enkephalin, and, endorphin, like, substances, have, been, found, in, earthworms, injections, of, naloxone, an, opioid, antagonist, inhibit, the, escape, responses, of, earthworms, this, indicates, that, opioid, substances, play, a, role, in, sensory, modulation, similar, to, that, found, in, many, vertebrates, although, some, worms, have, eyes, earthworms, do, not, however, they, do, have, specialized, photosensitive, cells, called, light, cells, of, hess, these, photoreceptor, cells, have, a, central, intracellular, cavity, phaosome, filled, with, microvilli, as, well, as, the, microvilli, there, are, several, sensory, cilia, in, the, phaosome, which, are, structurally, independent, of, the, microvilli, the, photoreceptors, are, distributed, in, most, parts, of, the, epidermis, but, are, more, concentrated, on, the, back, and, sides, of, the, worm, a, relatively, small, number, occur, on, the, ventral, surface, of, the, first, segment, they, are, most, numerous, in, the, prostomium, and, reduce, in, density, in, the, first, three, segments, they, are, very, few, in, number, past, the, third, segment, these, receptors, are, abundant, and, distributed, all, over, the, epidermis, each, receptor, shows, a, slightly, elevated, cuticle, which, covers, a, group, of, tall, slender, and, columnar, receptor, cells, these, cells, bear, small, hairlike, processes, at, their, outer, ends, and, their, inner, ends, are, connected, with, nerve, fibres, the, epidermal, receptors, are, tactile, in, function, they, are, also, concerned, with, changes, in, temperature, and, respond, to, chemical, stimuli, earthworms, are, extremely, sensitive, to, touch, and, mechanical, vibration, these, receptors, are, located, only, in, the, epithelium, of, the, buccal, chamber, these, receptors, are, gustatory, and, olfactory, related, to, taste, and, smell, they, also, respond, to, chemical, stimuli, chemoreceptor, the, gut, of, the, earthworm, is, a, straight, tube, that, extends, from, the, worm, s, mouth, to, its, anus, it, is, differentiated, into, an, alimentary, canal, and, associated, glands, which, are, embedded, in, the, wall, of, the, alimentary, canal, itself, the, alimentary, canal, consists, of, a, mouth, buccal, cavity, generally, running, through, the, first, one, or, two, segments, of, the, earthworm, pharynx, running, generally, about, four, segments, in, length, esophagus, crop, gizzard, usually, and, intestine, food, enters, at, the, mouth, the, pharynx, acts, as, a, suction, pump, its, muscular, walls, draw, in, food, in, the, pharynx, the, pharyngeal, glands, secrete, mucus, food, moves, into, the, esophagus, where, calcium, from, the, blood, and, ingested, from, previous, meals, is, pumped, in, to, maintain, proper, blood, calcium, levels, in, the, blood, and, food, ph, from, there, the, food, passes, into, the, crop, and, gizzard, in, the, gizzard, strong, muscular, contractions, grind, the, food, with, the, help, of, mineral, particles, ingested, along, with, the, food, once, through, the, gizzard, food, continues, through, the, intestine, for, digestion, the, intestine, secretes, pepsin, to, digest, proteins, amylase, to, digest, polysaccharides, cellulase, to, digest, cellulose, and, lipase, to, digest, fats, earthworms, use, in, addition, to, the, digestive, proteins, a, class, of, surface, active, compounds, called, drilodefensins, which, help, digest, plant, material, instead, of, being, coiled, like, a, mammalian, intestine, in, the, earthworm, s, intestine, a, large, mid, dorsal, tongue, like, fold, is, present, called, a, typhlosole, with, many, folds, running, along, its, length, increasing, its, surface, area, to, increase, nutrient, absorption, the, intestine, has, its, own, pair, of, muscle, layers, like, the, body, but, in, reverse, order, an, inner, circular, layer, within, an, outer, longitudinal, layer, earthworms, have, a, dual, circulatory, system, in, which, both, the, coelomic, fluid, and, a, closed, circulatory, system, carry, the, food, waste, and, respiratory, gases, the, closed, circulatory, system, has, five, main, blood, vessels, the, dorsal, top, vessel, which, runs, above, the, digestive, tract, the, ventral, bottom, vessel, which, runs, below, the, digestive, tract, the, subneural, vessel, which, runs, below, the, ventral, nerve, cord, and, two, lateroneural, vessels, on, either, side, of, the, nerve, cord, the, dorsal, vessel, is, mainly, a, collecting, structure, in, the, intestinal, region, it, receives, a, pair, commissural, and, dorsal, intestines, in, each, segment, the, ventral, vessel, branches, off, to, a, pair, of, ventro, tegumentaries, and, ventro, intestinals, in, each, segment, the, subneural, vessel, also, gives, out, a, pair, of, commissurals, running, along, the, posterior, surface, of, the, septum, the, pumping, action, on, the, dorsal, vessel, moves, the, blood, forward, while, the, other, four, longitudinal, vessels, carry, the, blood, rearward, in, segments, seven, through, eleven, a, pair, of, aortic, arches, ring, the, coelom, and, acts, as, hearts, pumping, the, blood, to, the, ventral, vessel, that, acts, as, the, aorta, the, blood, consists, of, ameboid, cells, and, haemoglobin, dissolved, in, the, plasma, the, second, circulatory, system, derives, from, the, cells, of, the, digestive, system, that, line, the, coelom, as, the, digestive, cells, become, full, they, release, non, living, cells, of, fat, into, the, fluid, filled, coelom, where, they, float, freely, but, can, pass, through, the, walls, separating, each, segment, moving, food, to, other, parts, and, assist, in, wound, healing, the, excretory, system, contains, a, pair, of, nephridia, in, every, segment, except, for, the, first, three, and, the, last, ones, the, three, types, of, nephridia, are, integumentary, septal, and, pharyngeal, the, integumentary, nephridia, lie, attached, to, the, inner, side, of, the, body, wall, in, all, segments, except, the, first, two, the, septal, nephridia, are, attached, to, both, sides, of, the, septa, behind, the, 15th, segment, the, pharyngeal, nephridia, are, attached, to, the, fourth, fifth, and, sixth, segments, the, waste, in, the, coelom, fluid, from, a, forward, segment, is, drawn, in, by, the, beating, of, cilia, of, the, nephrostome, from, there, it, is, carried, through, the, septum, wall, via, a, tube, which, forms, a, series, of, loops, entwined, by, blood, capillaries, that, also, transfer, waste, into, the, tubule, of, the, nephrostome, the, excretory, wastes, are, then, finally, discharged, through, a, pore, on, the, worm, s, side, earthworms, have, no, special, respiratory, organs, gases, are, exchanged, through, the, moist, skin, and, capillaries, where, the, oxygen, is, picked, up, by, the, haemoglobin, dissolved, in, the, blood, plasma, and, carbon, dioxide, is, released, water, as, well, as, salts, can, also, be, moved, through, the, skin, by, active, transport, at, birth, earthworms, emerge, small, but, fully, formed, lacking, only, their, sex, structures, which, develop, in, about, 60, to, 90, days, they, attain, full, size, in, about, one, year, scientists, predict, that, the, average, lifespan, under, field, conditions, is, four, to, eight, years, while, most, garden, varieties, live, only, one, to, two, years, several, common, earthworm, species, are, mostly, parthenogenetic, meaning, that, growth, and, development, of, embryos, happens, without, fertilization, among, lumbricid, earthworms, parthenogenesis, arose, from, sexual, relatives, many, times, parthenogenesis, in, some, aporrectodea, trapezoides, lineages, arose, 6, 4, to, 1, 1, million, years, ago, from, sexual, ancestors, a, few, species, exhibit, pseudogamous, parthogenesis, meaning, that, mating, is, necessary, to, stimulate, reproduction, even, though, no, male, genetic, material, passes, to, the, offspring, earthworm, mating, occurs, on, the, surface, most, often, at, night, earthworms, are, hermaphrodites, that, is, they, have, both, male, and, female, sexual, organs, the, sexual, organs, are, located, in, segments, 9, to, 15, earthworms, have, one, or, two, pairs, of, testes, contained, within, sacs, the, two, or, four, pairs, of, seminal, vesicles, produce, store, and, release, the, sperm, via, the, male, pores, ovaries, and, oviducts, in, segment, 13, release, eggs, via, female, pores, on, segment, 14, while, sperm, is, expelled, from, segment, 15, one, or, more, pairs, of, spermathecae, are, present, in, segments, 9, and, 10, depending, on, the, species, which, are, internal, sacs, that, receive, and, store, sperm, from, the, other, worm, during, copulation, as, a, result, segment, 15, of, one, worm, exudes, sperm, into, segments, 9, and, 10, with, its, storage, vesicles, of, its, mate, some, species, use, external, spermatophores, for, sperm, transfer, in, hormogaster, samnitica, and, hormogaster, elisae, transcriptome, dna, libraries, were, sequenced, and, two, sex, pheromones, attractin, and, temptin, were, detected, in, all, tissue, samples, of, both, species, sex, pheromones, are, probably, important, in, earthworms, because, they, live, in, an, environment, where, chemical, signaling, may, play, a, crucial, role, in, attracting, a, partner, and, in, facilitating, outcrossing, outcrossing, would, provide, the, benefit, of, masking, the, expression, of, deleterious, recessive, mutations, in, progeny, see, complementation, copulation, and, reproduction, are, separate, processes, in, earthworms, the, mating, pair, overlap, front, ends, ventrally, and, each, exchanges, sperm, with, the, other, the, clitellum, becomes, very, reddish, to, pinkish, in, colour, sometime, after, copulation, long, after, the, worms, have, separated, the, clitellum, behind, the, spermathecae, secretes, material, which, forms, a, ring, around, the, worm, the, worm, then, backs, out, of, the, ring, and, as, it, does, so, it, injects, its, own, eggs, and, the, other, worm, s, sperm, into, it, thus, each, worm, becomes, the, genetic, father, of, some, of, their, offspring, due, to, its, own, sperm, transferred, to, other, earthworm, and, the, genetic, mother, offsprings, from, its, own, egg, cells, of, the, rest, as, the, worm, slips, out, of, the, ring, the, ends, of, the, cocoon, seal, to, form, a, vaguely, onion, shaped, incubator, cocoon, in, which, the, embryonic, worms, develop, hence, fertilization, is, external, the, cocoon, is, then, deposited, in, the, soil, after, three, weeks, 2, to, 20, offspring, hatch, with, an, average, of, 4, development, is, direct, i, e, without, formation, of, any, larva, exposure, of, the, earthworm, eisenia, fetida, to, ionizing, radiation, induced, dna, strand, breaks, and, oxidized, dna, bases, these, dna, damages, could, then, be, repaired, in, somatic, and, spermatogenic, cells, earthworms, testis, cells, are, also, capable, of, repairing, hydrogen, peroxide, induced, oxidative, dna, adducts, earthworms, travel, underground, by, means, of, waves, of, muscular, contractions, which, alternately, shorten, and, lengthen, the, body, peristalsis, the, shortened, part, is, anchored, to, the, surrounding, soil, by, tiny, clawlike, bristles, setae, set, along, its, segmented, length, in, all, the, body, segments, except, the, first, last, and, clitellum, there, is, a, ring, of, s, shaped, setae, embedded, in, the, epidermal, pit, of, each, segment, perichaetine, the, whole, burrowing, process, is, aided, by, the, secretion, of, lubricating, mucus, as, a, result, of, their, movement, through, their, lubricated, tunnels, worms, can, make, gurgling, noises, underground, when, disturbed, earthworms, move, through, soil, by, expanding, crevices, with, force, when, forces, are, measured, according, to, body, weight, hatchlings, can, push, 500, times, their, own, body, weight, whereas, large, adults, can, push, only, 10, times, their, own, body, weight, earthworms, have, the, ability, to, regenerate, lost, segments, but, this, ability, varies, between, species, and, depends, on, the, extent, of, the, damage, stephenson, 1930, devoted, a, chapter, of, his, monograph, to, this, topic, while, g, e, gates, spent, 20, years, studying, regeneration, in, a, variety, of, species, but, because, little, interest, was, shown, gates, 1972, published, only, a, few, of, his, findings, these, nevertheless, show, it, is, theoretically, possible, to, grow, two, whole, worms, from, a, bisected, specimen, in, certain, species, gates, s, reports, included, an, unidentified, tasmanian, earthworm, shown, growing, a, replacement, head, has, been, reported, within, the, world, of, taxonomy, the, stable, classical, system, of, michaelsen, 1900, and, stephenson, 1930, was, gradually, eroded, by, the, controversy, over, how, to, classify, earthworms, such, that, fender, and, mckey, fender, 1990, went, so, far, as, to, say, the, family, level, classification, of, the, megascolecid, earthworms, is, in, chaos, over, the, years, many, scientists, have, developed, their, own, classification, systems, for, earthworms, which, led, to, confusion, and, these, systems, have, been, and, still, continue, to, be, revised, and, updated, the, classification, system, used, here, which, was, developed, by, blakemore, 2000, is, a, modern, reversion, to, the, classical, system, that, is, historically, proven, and, widely, accepted, categorization, of, a, megadrile, earthworm, into, one, of, its, taxonomic, families, under, suborders, lumbricina, and, moniligastrida, is, based, on, such, features, as, the, makeup, of, the, clitellum, the, location, and, disposition, of, the, sex, features, pores, prostatic, glands, etc, number, of, gizzards, and, body, shape, currently, over, 6, 000, species, of, terrestrial, earthworms, are, named, as, provided, in, a, species, name, database, but, the, number, of, synonyms, is, unknown, the, families, with, their, known, distributions, or, origins, from, a, total, of, around, 7, 000, species, only, about, 150, species, are, widely, distributed, around, the, world, these, are, the, peregrine, or, cosmopolitan, earthworms, of, the, 182, taxa, of, earthworms, found, in, the, united, states, and, canada, 60, 33, are, introduced, species, earthworms, are, classified, into, three, main, ecophysiological, categories, 1, leaf, litter, or, compost, dwelling, worms, that, are, nonburrowing, live, at, the, soil, litter, interface, and, eat, decomposing, organic, matter, epigeic, e, g, eisenia, fetida, 2, topsoil, or, subsoil, dwelling, worms, that, feed, on, soil, burrow, and, cast, within, the, soil, creating, horizontal, burrows, in, upper, 10, 30, cm, of, soil, endogeic, and, 3, worms, that, construct, permanent, deep, vertical, burrows, which, they, use, to, visit, the, surface, to, obtain, plant, material, for, food, such, as, leaves, anecic, meaning, reaching, up, e, g, lumbricus, terrestris, earthworm, populations, depend, on, both, physical, and, chemical, properties, of, the, soil, such, as, temperature, moisture, ph, salts, aeration, and, texture, as, well, as, available, food, and, the, ability, of, the, species, to, reproduce, and, disperse, one, of, the, most, important, environmental, factors, is, ph, but, earthworms, vary, in, their, preferences, most, favour, neutral, to, slightly, acidic, soils, lumbricus, terrestris, is, still, present, in, a, ph, of, 5, 4, dendrobaena, octaedra, at, a, ph, of, 4, 3, and, some, megascolecidae, are, present, in, extremely, acidic, humic, soils, soil, ph, may, also, influence, the, numbers, of, worms, that, go, into, diapause, the, more, acidic, the, soil, the, sooner, worms, go, into, diapause, and, remain, in, diapause, the, longest, time, at, a, ph, of, 6, 4, earthworms, are, preyed, upon, by, many, species, of, birds, e, g, robins, starlings, thrushes, gulls, crows, snakes, wood, turtles, mammals, e, g, bears, boars, foxes, hedgehogs, pigs, moles, and, invertebrates, e, g, ants, flatworms, ground, beetles, and, other, beetles, snails, spiders, and, slugs, earthworms, have, many, internal, parasites, including, protozoa, platyhelminthes, mites, and, nematodes, they, can, be, found, in, the, worms, blood, seminal, vesicles, coelom, or, intestine, or, in, their, cocoons, e, g, the, mite, histiostoma, murchiei, is, a, parasite, of, earthworm, cocoons, the, earthworm, activity, aerates, and, mixes, the, soil, and, is, conducive, to, mineralization, of, nutrients, and, their, uptake, by, vegetation, certain, species, of, earthworm, come, to, the, surface, and, graze, on, the, higher, concentrations, of, organic, matter, present, there, mixing, it, with, the, mineral, soil, because, a, high, level, of, organic, matter, mixing, is, associated, with, soil, fertility, an, abundance, of, earthworms, is, generally, considered, beneficial, by, farmers, and, gardeners, as, long, ago, as, 1881, charles, darwin, wrote, it, may, be, doubted, whether, there, are, many, other, animals, which, have, played, so, important, a, part, in, the, history, of, the, world, as, have, these, lowly, organized, creatures, also, while, as, the, name, suggests, the, main, habitat, of, earthworms, is, in, soil, they, are, not, restricted, to, this, habitat, the, brandling, worm, eisenia, fetida, lives, in, decaying, plant, matter, and, manure, arctiostrotus, vancouverensis, from, vancouver, island, and, the, olympic, peninsula, is, generally, found, in, decaying, conifer, logs, aporrectodea, limicola, sparganophilus, spp, and, several, others, are, found, in, mud, in, streams, some, species, are, arboreal, some, aquatic, and, some, euryhaline, salt, water, tolerant, and, littoral, living, on, the, sea, shore, e, g, pontodrilus, litoralis, even, in, the, soil, species, special, habitats, such, as, soils, derived, from, serpentine, have, an, earthworm, fauna, of, their, own, vermicomposting, of, organic, wastes, and, addition, of, this, organic, matter, to, the, soil, preferably, as, a, surface, mulch, will, provide, several, species, of, earthworms, with, their, food, and, nutrient, requirements, and, will, create, the, optimum, conditions, of, temperature, and, moisture, that, will, stimulate, their, activity, earthworms, are, environmental, indicators, of, soil, health, earthworms, feed, on, the, decaying, matter, in, the, soil, and, analyzing, the, contents, of, their, digestive, tracts, gives, insight, into, the, overall, condition, of, the, soil, the, earthworm, gut, accumulates, chemicals, including, heavy, metals, such, as, cadmium, mercury, zinc, and, copper, the, population, size, of, the, earthworm, indicates, the, quality, of, the, soil, as, healthy, soil, would, contain, a, larger, number, of, earthworms, the, major, benefits, of, earthworm, activities, to, soil, fertility, for, agriculture, can, be, summarized, as, earthworms, accelerate, nutrient, cycling, in, the, soil, plant, system, through, fragmentation, mixing, of, plant, debris, physical, grinding, chemical, digestion, the, earthworm, s, existence, cannot, be, taken, for, granted, dr, w, e, shewell, cooper, observed, tremendous, numerical, differences, between, adjacent, gardens, and, worm, populations, are, affected, by, a, host, of, environmental, factors, many, of, which, can, be, influenced, by, good, management, practices, on, the, part, of, the, gardener, or, farmer, darwin, estimated, that, arable, land, contains, up, to, 53, 000, per, acre, 130, 000, ha, of, worms, but, more, recent, research, has, produced, figures, suggesting, that, even, poor, soil, may, support, 250, 000, per, acre, 620, 000, ha, whilst, rich, fertile, farmland, may, have, up, to, 1, 750, 000, per, acre, 4, 300, 000, ha, meaning, that, the, weight, of, earthworms, beneath, a, farmer, s, soil, could, be, greater, than, that, of, the, livestock, upon, its, surface, richly, organic, topsoil, populations, of, earthworms, are, much, higher, averaging, 500, per, square, metre, 46, sq, ft, and, up, to, 400, g2, such, that, for, the, 7, billion, of, us, each, person, alive, today, has, support, of, 7, million, earthworms, the, ability, to, break, down, organic, materials, and, excrete, concentrated, nutrients, makes, the, earthworm, a, functional, contributor, in, restoration, projects, in, response, to, ecosystem, disturbances, some, sites, have, utilized, earthworms, to, prepare, soil, for, the, return, of, native, flora, research, from, the, station, d, cologie, tropicale, de, lamto, asserts, that, the, earthworms, positively, influence, the, rate, of, macroaggregate, formation, an, important, feature, for, soil, structure, the, stability, of, aggregates, in, response, to, water, was, also, found, to, be, improved, when, constructed, by, earthworms, though, not, fully, quantified, yet, greenhouse, gas, emissions, of, earthworms, likely, contribute, to, global, warming, especially, since, top, dwelling, earthworms, increase, the, speed, of, carbon, cycles, and, have, been, spread, by, humans, into, many, new, geographies, nitrogenous, fertilizers, tend, to, create, acidic, conditions, which, are, fatal, to, the, worms, and, dead, specimens, are, often, found, on, the, surface, following, the, application, of, substances, such, as, ddt, lime, sulphur, and, lead, arsenate, in, australia, changes, in, farming, practices, such, as, the, application, of, superphosphates, on, pastures, and, a, switch, from, pastoral, farming, to, arable, farming, had, a, devastating, effect, on, populations, of, the, giant, gippsland, earthworm, leading, to, their, classification, as, a, protected, species, globally, certain, earthworms, populations, have, been, devastated, by, deviation, from, organic, production, and, the, spraying, of, synthetic, fertilizers, and, biocides, with, at, least, three, species, now, listed, as, extinct, but, many, more, endangered, various, species, of, worms, are, used, in, vermiculture, the, practice, of, feeding, organic, waste, to, earthworms, to, decompose, food, waste, these, are, usually, eisenia, fetida, or, its, close, relative, eisenia, andrei, or, the, brandling, worm, commonly, known, as, the, tiger, worm, or, red, wiggler, they, are, distinct, from, soil, dwelling, earthworms, in, the, tropics, the, african, nightcrawler, eudrilus, eugeniae, and, the, indian, blue, perionyx, excavatus, are, used, earthworms, are, sold, all, over, the, world, the, market, is, sizable, according, to, doug, collicutt, in, 1980, 370, million, worms, were, exported, from, canada, with, a, canadian, export, value, of, 13, million, and, an, american, retail, value, of, 54, million, earthworms, provide, an, excellent, source, of, protein, for, fish, fowl, and, pigs, but, have, also, been, used, traditionally, for, human, consumption, noke, is, a, culinary, term, used, by, the, m, ori, of, new, zealand, to, refer, to, earthworms, which, they, consider, delicacies, for, their, chiefs
