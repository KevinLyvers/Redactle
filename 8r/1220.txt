ageing, or, aging, in, american, english, is, the, process, of, becoming, older, the, term, refers, mainly, to, humans, many, other, animals, and, fungi, whereas, for, example, bacteria, perennial, plants, and, some, simple, animals, are, potentially, biologically, immortal, in, a, broader, sense, ageing, can, refer, to, single, cells, within, an, organism, which, have, ceased, dividing, or, to, the, population, of, a, species, in, humans, ageing, represents, the, accumulation, of, changes, in, a, human, being, over, time, and, can, encompass, physical, psychological, and, social, changes, reaction, time, for, example, may, slow, with, age, while, memories, and, general, knowledge, typically, increase, ageing, is, associated, with, increased, risk, of, cancer, alzheimer, s, disease, diabetes, cardiovascular, disease, increased, mental, health, risks, and, many, more, of, the, roughly, 150, 000, people, who, die, each, day, across, the, globe, about, two, thirds, die, from, age, related, causes, certain, lifestyle, choices, and, socioeconomic, conditions, have, been, linked, to, ageing, current, ageing, theories, are, assigned, to, the, damage, concept, whereby, the, accumulation, of, damage, such, as, dna, oxidation, may, cause, biological, systems, to, fail, or, to, the, programmed, ageing, concept, whereby, the, internal, processes, epigenetic, maintenance, such, as, dna, methylation, inherently, may, cause, ageing, programmed, ageing, should, not, be, confused, with, programmed, cell, death, apoptosis, human, beings, and, members, of, other, species, especially, animals, age, and, die, fungi, too, can, age, in, contrast, many, species, can, be, considered, potentially, immortal, for, example, bacteria, fission, to, produce, daughter, cells, strawberry, plants, grow, runners, to, produce, clones, of, themselves, and, animals, in, the, genus, hydra, have, a, regenerative, ability, by, which, they, avoid, dying, of, old, age, early, life, forms, on, earth, starting, at, least, 3, 7, billion, years, ago, were, single, celled, organisms, such, organisms, prokaryotes, protozoans, algae, multiply, by, fission, into, daughter, cells, thus, do, not, age, and, are, potentially, immortal, under, favourable, conditions, ageing, and, mortality, of, the, individual, organism, became, possible, with, the, evolution, of, sexual, reproduction, which, occurred, with, the, emergence, of, the, fungal, animal, kingdoms, approximately, a, billion, years, ago, and, the, evolution, of, seed, producing, plants, 320, million, years, ago, the, sexual, organism, could, henceforth, pass, on, some, of, its, genetic, material, to, produce, new, individuals, and, could, itself, become, disposable, with, respect, to, the, survival, of, its, species, this, classic, biological, idea, has, however, been, perturbed, recently, by, the, discovery, that, the, bacterium, e, coli, may, split, into, distinguishable, daughter, cells, which, opens, the, theoretical, possibility, of, age, classes, among, bacteria, even, within, humans, and, other, mortal, species, there, are, cells, with, the, potential, for, immortality, cancer, cells, which, have, lost, the, ability, to, die, when, maintained, in, a, cell, culture, such, as, the, hela, cell, line, and, specific, stem, cells, such, as, germ, cells, producing, ova, and, spermatozoa, in, artificial, cloning, adult, cells, can, be, rejuvenated, to, embryonic, status, and, then, used, to, grow, a, new, tissue, or, animal, without, ageing, normal, human, cells, however, die, after, about, 50, cell, divisions, in, laboratory, culture, the, hayflick, limit, discovered, by, leonard, hayflick, in, 1961, a, number, of, characteristic, ageing, symptoms, are, experienced, by, a, majority, or, by, a, significant, proportion, of, humans, during, their, lifetimes, dementia, becomes, more, common, with, age, about, 3, of, people, between, the, ages, of, 65, and, 74, 19, of, those, between, 75, and, 84, and, nearly, half, of, those, over, 85, years, old, have, dementia, the, spectrum, ranges, from, mild, cognitive, impairment, to, the, neurodegenerative, diseases, of, alzheimer, s, disease, cerebrovascular, disease, parkinson, s, disease, and, lou, gehrig, s, disease, furthermore, many, types, of, memory, decline, with, ageing, but, not, semantic, memory, or, general, knowledge, such, as, vocabulary, definitions, these, typically, increase, or, remain, steady, until, late, adulthood, see, ageing, brain, intelligence, declines, with, age, though, the, rate, varies, depending, on, the, type, and, may, in, fact, remain, steady, throughout, most, of, the, human, lifespan, dropping, suddenly, only, as, people, near, the, end, of, their, lives, individual, variations, in, the, rate, of, cognitive, decline, may, therefore, be, explained, in, terms, of, people, having, different, lengths, of, life, there, are, changes, to, the, brain, after, 20, years, of, age, there, is, a, 10, reduction, each, decade, in, the, total, length, of, the, brain, s, myelinated, axons, age, can, result, in, visual, impairment, whereby, non, verbal, communication, is, reduced, which, can, lead, to, isolation, and, possible, depression, older, adults, however, may, not, experience, depression, as, much, as, younger, adults, and, were, paradoxically, found, to, have, improved, mood, despite, declining, physical, health, macular, degeneration, causes, vision, loss, and, increases, with, age, affecting, nearly, 12, of, those, above, the, age, of, 80, this, degeneration, is, caused, by, systemic, changes, in, the, circulation, of, waste, products, and, by, the, growth, of, abnormal, vessels, around, the, retina, other, visual, diseases, that, often, appear, with, age, are, cataracts, and, glaucoma, a, cataract, occurs, when, the, lens, of, the, eye, becomes, cloudy, making, vision, blurry, it, eventually, causes, blindness, if, untreated, they, develop, over, time, and, are, seen, most, often, with, those, that, are, older, cataracts, can, be, treated, through, surgery, glaucoma, is, another, common, visual, disease, that, appears, in, older, adults, glaucoma, is, caused, by, damage, to, the, optic, nerve, causing, vision, loss, glaucoma, usually, develops, over, time, but, there, are, variations, to, glaucoma, and, some, have, a, sudden, onset, there, are, a, few, procedures, for, glaucoma, but, there, is, no, cure, or, fix, for, the, damage, once, it, has, occurred, prevention, is, the, best, measure, in, the, case, of, glaucoma, in, addition, to, physical, symptoms, aging, can, also, cause, a, number, of, mental, health, issues, as, older, adults, deal, with, challenges, such, as, the, death, of, loved, ones, retirement, and, loss, of, purpose, as, well, as, their, own, health, issues, some, warning, signs, are, changes, in, mood, or, energy, changes, in, sleep, or, eating, habits, pain, sadness, unhealthy, coping, mechanisms, such, as, smoking, suicidal, ideations, and, others, older, adults, are, more, prone, to, social, isolation, as, well, which, can, further, increase, the, risk, for, physical, and, mental, conditions, such, as, anxiety, depression, and, cognitive, decline, a, distinction, can, be, made, between, proximal, ageing, age, based, effects, that, come, about, because, of, factors, in, the, recent, past, and, distal, ageing, age, based, differences, that, can, be, traced, to, a, cause, in, a, person, s, early, life, such, as, childhood, poliomyelitis, ageing, is, among, the, greatest, known, risk, factors, for, most, human, diseases, of, the, roughly, 150, 000, people, who, die, each, day, across, the, globe, about, two, thirds, 100, 000, per, day, die, from, age, related, causes, in, industrialized, nations, the, proportion, is, higher, reaching, 90, in, the, 21st, century, researchers, are, only, beginning, to, investigate, the, biological, basis, of, ageing, even, in, relatively, simple, and, short, lived, organisms, such, as, yeast, little, is, known, of, mammalian, ageing, in, part, due, to, the, much, longer, lives, of, even, small, mammals, such, as, the, mouse, around, 3, years, a, model, organism, for, the, study, of, ageing, is, the, nematode, c, elegans, having, a, short, lifespan, of, 2, 3, weeks, enabling, genetic, manipulations, or, suppression, of, gene, activity, with, rna, interference, and, other, factors, most, known, mutations, and, rna, interference, targets, that, extend, lifespan, were, first, discovered, in, c, elegans, the, factors, proposed, to, influence, biological, ageing, fall, into, two, main, categories, programmed, and, error, related, programmed, factors, follow, a, biological, timetable, that, might, be, a, continuation, of, inherent, mechanisms, that, regulate, childhood, growth, and, development, this, regulation, would, depend, on, changes, in, gene, expression, that, affect, the, systems, responsible, for, maintenance, repair, and, defense, responses, factors, causing, errors, or, damage, include, internal, and, environmental, events, that, induce, cumulative, deterioration, in, one, or, more, organs, one, 2013, review, assessed, ageing, through, the, lens, of, the, damage, theory, proposing, nine, metabolic, hallmarks, of, ageing, in, various, organisms, but, especially, mammals, there, are, three, main, metabolic, pathways, which, can, influence, the, rate, of, ageing, discussed, below, it, is, likely, that, most, of, these, pathways, affect, ageing, separately, because, targeting, them, simultaneously, leads, to, additive, increases, in, lifespan, the, rate, of, ageing, varies, substantially, across, different, species, and, this, to, a, large, extent, is, genetically, based, for, example, numerous, perennial, plants, ranging, from, strawberries, and, potatoes, to, willow, trees, typically, produce, clones, of, themselves, by, vegetative, reproduction, and, are, thus, potentially, immortal, while, annual, plants, such, as, wheat, and, watermelons, die, each, year, and, reproduce, by, sexual, reproduction, in, 2008, it, was, discovered, that, inactivation, of, only, two, genes, in, the, annual, plant, arabidopsis, thaliana, leads, to, its, conversion, into, a, potentially, immortal, perennial, plant, the, oldest, animals, known, so, far, are, 15, 000, year, old, antarctic, sponges, which, can, reproduce, both, sexually, and, clonally, clonal, immortality, apart, there, are, certain, species, whose, individual, lifespans, stand, out, among, earth, s, life, forms, including, the, bristlecone, pine, at, 5062, years, or, 5067, years, invertebrates, like, the, hard, clam, known, as, quahog, in, new, england, at, 508, years, the, greenland, shark, at, 400, years, various, deep, sea, tube, worms, at, over, 300, years, fish, like, the, sturgeon, and, the, rockfish, and, the, sea, anemone, and, lobster, such, organisms, are, sometimes, said, to, exhibit, negligible, senescence, the, genetic, aspect, has, also, been, demonstrated, in, studies, of, human, centenarians, life, span, like, other, phenotypes, is, selected, for, in, evolution, traits, that, benefit, early, survival, and, reproduction, will, be, selected, for, even, if, they, contribute, to, an, earlier, death, such, a, genetic, effect, is, called, the, antagonistic, pleiotropy, effect, when, referring, to, a, gene, pleiotropy, signifying, the, gene, has, a, double, function, enabling, reproduction, at, a, young, age, but, costing, the, organism, life, expectancy, in, old, age, and, is, called, the, disposable, soma, effect, when, referring, to, an, entire, genetic, programme, the, organism, diverting, limited, resources, from, maintenance, to, reproduction, the, biological, mechanisms, which, regulate, lifespan, probably, evolved, with, the, first, multicellular, organisms, more, than, a, billion, years, ago, however, even, single, celled, organisms, such, as, yeast, have, been, used, as, models, in, ageing, hence, ageing, has, its, biological, roots, much, earlier, than, multi, cellularity, main, article, dna, damage, theory, of, aging, the, mediterranean, diet, is, credited, with, lowering, the, risk, of, heart, disease, and, early, death, the, major, contributors, to, mortality, risk, reduction, appear, to, be, a, higher, consumption, of, vegetables, fish, fruits, nuts, and, monounsaturated, fatty, acids, such, as, by, consuming, olive, oil, as, of, 2021, there, is, insufficient, clinical, evidence, that, calorie, restriction, or, any, dietary, practice, affects, the, process, of, ageing, people, who, participate, in, moderate, to, high, levels, of, physical, exercise, have, a, lower, mortality, rate, compared, to, individuals, who, are, not, physically, active, the, majority, of, the, benefits, from, exercise, are, achieved, with, around, 3500, metabolic, equivalent, met, minutes, per, week, for, example, climbing, stairs, 10, minutes, vacuuming, 15, minutes, gardening, 20, minutes, running, 20, minutes, and, walking, or, bicycling, for, 25, minutes, on, a, daily, basis, would, together, achieve, about, 3000, met, minutes, a, week, a, meta, analysis, showed, that, loneliness, carries, a, higher, mortality, risk, than, smoking, different, cultures, express, age, in, different, ways, the, age, of, an, adult, human, is, commonly, measured, in, whole, years, since, the, day, of, birth, the, most, notable, exception, east, asian, age, reckoning, is, becoming, less, common, particularly, in, official, contexts, arbitrary, divisions, set, to, mark, periods, of, life, may, include, juvenile, from, infancy, through, childhood, preadolescence, and, adolescence, early, adulthood, middle, adulthood, and, late, adulthood, informal, terms, include, tweens, teenagers, twentysomething, thirtysomething, etc, as, well, as, denarian, vicenarian, tricenarian, quadragenarian, etc, most, legal, systems, define, a, specific, age, for, when, an, individual, is, allowed, or, obliged, to, do, particular, activities, these, age, specifications, include, voting, age, drinking, age, age, of, consent, age, of, majority, age, of, criminal, responsibility, marriageable, age, age, of, candidacy, and, mandatory, retirement, age, admission, to, a, movie, for, instance, may, depend, on, age, according, to, a, motion, picture, rating, system, a, bus, fare, might, be, discounted, for, the, young, or, old, each, nation, government, and, non, governmental, organization, has, different, ways, of, classifying, age, in, other, words, chronological, ageing, may, be, distinguished, from, social, ageing, cultural, age, expectations, of, how, people, should, act, as, they, grow, older, and, biological, ageing, an, organism, s, physical, state, as, it, ages, ageism, cost, the, united, states, 63, billion, in, one, year, according, to, a, yale, school, of, public, health, study, in, a, unfpa, report, about, ageing, in, the, 21st, century, it, highlighted, the, need, to, develop, a, new, rights, based, culture, of, ageing, and, a, change, of, mindset, and, societal, attitudes, towards, ageing, and, older, persons, from, welfare, recipients, to, active, contributing, members, of, society, unfpa, said, that, this, requires, among, others, working, towards, the, development, of, international, human, rights, instruments, and, their, translation, into, national, laws, and, regulations, and, affirmative, measures, that, challenge, age, discrimination, and, recognise, older, people, as, autonomous, subjects, older, people, s, music, participation, contributes, to, the, maintenance, of, interpersonal, relationships, and, promoting, successful, ageing, at, the, same, time, older, persons, can, make, contributions, to, society, including, caregiving, and, volunteering, for, example, a, study, of, bolivian, migrants, who, moved, to, spain, found, that, 69, left, their, children, at, home, usually, with, grandparents, in, rural, china, grandparents, care, for, 38, of, children, aged, under, five, whose, parents, have, gone, to, work, in, cities, population, ageing, is, the, increase, in, the, number, and, proportion, of, older, people, in, society, population, ageing, has, three, possible, causes, migration, longer, life, expectancy, decreased, death, rate, and, decreased, birth, rate, ageing, has, a, significant, impact, on, society, young, people, tend, to, have, fewer, legal, privileges, if, they, are, below, the, age, of, majority, they, are, more, likely, to, push, for, political, and, social, change, to, develop, and, adopt, new, technologies, and, to, need, education, older, people, have, different, requirements, from, society, and, government, and, frequently, have, differing, values, as, well, such, as, for, property, and, pension, rights, in, the, 21st, century, one, of, the, most, significant, population, trends, is, ageing, currently, over, 11, of, the, world, s, current, population, are, people, aged, 60, and, older, and, the, united, nations, population, fund, unfpa, estimates, that, by, 2050, that, number, will, rise, to, approximately, 22, ageing, has, occurred, due, to, development, which, has, enabled, better, nutrition, sanitation, health, care, education, and, economic, well, being, consequently, fertility, rates, have, continued, to, decline, and, life, expectancy, has, risen, life, expectancy, at, birth, is, over, 80, now, in, 33, countries, ageing, is, a, global, phenomenon, that, is, occurring, fastest, in, developing, countries, including, those, with, large, youth, populations, and, poses, social, and, economic, challenges, to, the, work, which, can, be, overcome, with, the, right, set, of, policies, to, equip, individuals, families, and, societies, to, address, these, challenges, and, to, reap, its, benefits, as, life, expectancy, rises, and, birth, rates, decline, in, developed, countries, the, median, age, rises, accordingly, according, to, the, united, nations, this, process, is, taking, place, in, nearly, every, country, in, the, world, a, rising, median, age, can, have, significant, social, and, economic, implications, as, the, workforce, gets, progressively, older, and, the, number, of, old, workers, and, retirees, grows, relative, to, the, number, of, young, workers, older, people, generally, incur, more, health, related, costs, than, do, younger, people, in, the, workplace, and, can, also, cost, more, in, worker, s, compensation, and, pension, liabilities, in, most, developed, countries, an, older, workforce, is, somewhat, inevitable, in, the, united, states, for, instance, the, bureau, of, labor, statistics, estimates, that, one, in, four, american, workers, will, be, 55, or, older, by, 2020, among, the, most, urgent, concerns, of, older, persons, worldwide, is, income, security, this, poses, challenges, for, governments, with, ageing, populations, to, ensure, investments, in, pension, systems, continues, to, provide, economic, independence, and, reduce, poverty, in, old, age, these, challenges, vary, for, developing, and, developed, countries, unfpa, stated, that, sustainability, of, these, systems, is, of, particular, concern, particularly, in, developed, countries, while, social, protection, and, old, age, pension, coverage, remain, a, challenge, for, developing, countries, where, a, large, proportion, of, the, labour, force, is, found, in, the, informal, sector, the, global, economic, crisis, has, increased, financial, pressure, to, ensure, economic, security, and, access, to, health, care, in, old, age, to, elevate, this, pressure, social, protection, floors, must, be, implemented, in, order, to, guarantee, income, security, and, access, to, essential, health, and, social, services, for, all, older, persons, and, provide, a, safety, net, that, contributes, to, the, postponement, of, disability, and, prevention, of, impoverishment, in, old, age, it, has, been, argued, that, population, ageing, has, undermined, economic, development, and, can, lead, to, lower, inflation, because, elderly, individuals, care, especially, strongly, about, the, value, of, their, pensions, and, savings, evidence, suggests, that, pensions, while, making, a, difference, to, the, well, being, of, older, persons, also, benefit, entire, families, especially, in, times, of, crisis, when, there, may, be, a, shortage, or, loss, of, employment, within, households, a, study, by, the, australian, government, in, 2003, estimated, that, women, between, the, ages, of, 65, and, 74, years, contribute, a, 16, billion, per, year, in, unpaid, caregiving, and, voluntary, work, similarly, men, in, the, same, age, group, contributed, a, 10, billion, per, year, due, to, increasing, share, of, the, elderly, in, the, population, health, care, expenditures, will, continue, to, grow, relative, to, the, economy, in, coming, decades, this, has, been, considered, as, a, negative, phenomenon, and, effective, strategies, like, labour, productivity, enhancement, should, be, considered, to, deal, with, negative, consequences, of, ageing, in, the, field, of, sociology, and, mental, health, ageing, is, seen, in, five, different, views, ageing, as, maturity, ageing, as, decline, ageing, as, a, life, cycle, event, ageing, as, generation, and, ageing, as, survival, positive, correlates, with, ageing, often, include, economics, employment, marriage, children, education, and, sense, of, control, as, well, as, many, others, the, social, science, of, ageing, includes, disengagement, theory, activity, theory, selectivity, theory, and, continuity, theory, retirement, a, common, transition, faced, by, the, elderly, may, have, both, positive, and, negative, consequences, as, cyborgs, currently, are, on, the, rise, some, theorists, argue, there, is, a, need, to, develop, new, definitions, of, ageing, and, for, instance, a, bio, techno, social, definition, of, ageing, has, been, suggested, there, is, a, current, debate, as, to, whether, or, not, the, pursuit, of, longevity, and, the, postponement, of, senescence, are, cost, effective, health, care, goals, given, finite, health, care, resources, because, of, the, accumulated, infirmities, of, old, age, bioethicist, ezekiel, emanuel, opines, that, the, pursuit, of, longevity, via, the, compression, of, morbidity, hypothesis, is, a, fantasy, and, that, human, life, is, not, worth, living, after, age, 75, longevity, then, should, not, be, a, goal, of, health, care, policy, this, opinion, has, been, contested, by, neurosurgeon, and, medical, ethicist, miguel, faria, who, states, that, life, can, be, worthwhile, during, old, age, and, that, longevity, should, be, pursued, in, association, with, the, attainment, of, quality, of, life, faria, claims, that, postponement, of, senescence, as, well, as, happiness, and, wisdom, can, be, attained, in, old, age, in, a, large, proportion, of, those, who, lead, healthy, lifestyles, and, remain, intellectually, active, with, age, inevitable, biological, changes, occur, that, increase, the, risk, of, illness, and, disability, unfpa, states, that, a, life, cycle, approach, to, health, care, one, that, starts, early, continues, through, the, reproductive, years, and, lasts, into, old, age, is, essential, for, the, physical, and, emotional, well, being, of, older, persons, and, indeed, all, people, public, policies, and, programmes, should, additionally, address, the, needs, of, older, impoverished, people, who, cannot, afford, health, care, many, societies, in, western, europe, and, japan, have, ageing, populations, while, the, effects, on, society, are, complex, there, is, a, concern, about, the, impact, on, health, care, demand, the, large, number, of, suggestions, in, the, literature, for, specific, interventions, to, cope, with, the, expected, increase, in, demand, for, long, term, care, in, ageing, societies, can, be, organized, under, four, headings, improve, system, performance, redesign, service, delivery, support, informal, caregivers, and, shift, demographic, parameters, however, the, annual, growth, in, national, health, spending, is, not, mainly, due, to, increasing, demand, from, ageing, populations, but, rather, has, been, driven, by, rising, incomes, costly, new, medical, technology, a, shortage, of, health, care, workers, and, informational, asymmetries, between, providers, and, patients, a, number, of, health, problems, become, more, prevalent, as, people, get, older, these, include, mental, health, problems, as, well, as, physical, health, problems, especially, dementia, it, has, been, estimated, that, population, ageing, only, explains, 0, 2, percentage, points, of, the, annual, growth, rate, in, medical, spending, of, 4, 3, since, 1970, in, addition, certain, reforms, to, the, medicare, system, in, the, united, states, decreased, elderly, spending, on, home, health, care, by, 12, 5, per, year, between, 1996, and, 2000, beauty, standards, have, evolved, over, time, and, as, scientific, research, in, cosmeceuticals, cosmetic, products, seen, to, have, medicinal, benefits, like, anti, ageing, creams, has, increased, the, industry, has, also, expanded, the, kinds, of, products, they, produce, such, as, serums, and, creams, have, gradually, gained, popularity, and, become, a, part, of, many, people, s, personal, care, routine, the, increase, in, demand, for, cosmeceuticals, has, led, scientists, to, find, ingredients, for, these, products, in, unorthodox, places, for, example, the, secretion, of, cryptomphalus, aspersa, or, brown, garden, snail, has, been, found, to, have, antioxidant, properties, increase, skin, cell, proliferation, and, increase, extracellular, proteins, such, as, collagen, and, fibronectin, important, proteins, for, cell, proliferation, another, substance, used, to, prevent, the, physical, manifestations, of, ageing, is, onobotulinumtoxina, the, toxin, injected, for, botox, in, some, cultures, old, age, is, celebrated, and, honoured, in, korea, for, example, a, special, party, called, hwangap, is, held, to, celebrate, and, congratulate, an, individual, for, turning, 60, years, old, in, china, respect, for, elderly, is, often, the, basis, for, how, a, community, is, organized, and, has, been, at, the, foundation, of, chinese, culture, and, morality, for, thousands, of, years, older, people, are, respected, for, their, wisdom, and, most, important, decisions, have, traditionally, not, been, made, without, consulting, them, this, is, a, similar, case, for, most, asian, countries, such, as, the, philippines, thailand, vietnam, singapore, etc, positive, self, perceptions, of, ageing, are, associated, with, better, mental, and, physical, health, and, well, being, positive, self, perception, of, health, has, been, correlated, with, higher, well, being, and, reduced, mortality, among, the, elderly, various, reasons, have, been, proposed, for, this, association, people, who, are, objectively, healthy, may, naturally, rate, their, health, better, as, than, that, of, their, ill, counterparts, though, this, link, has, been, observed, even, in, studies, which, have, controlled, for, socioeconomic, status, psychological, functioning, and, health, status, this, finding, is, generally, stronger, for, men, than, women, though, this, relationship, is, not, universal, across, all, studies, and, may, only, be, true, in, some, circumstances, as, people, age, subjective, health, remains, relatively, stable, even, though, objective, health, worsens, in, fact, perceived, health, improves, with, age, when, objective, health, is, controlled, in, the, equation, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, the, paradox, of, ageing, this, may, be, a, result, of, social, comparison, for, instance, the, older, people, get, the, more, they, may, consider, themselves, in, better, health, than, their, same, aged, peers, elderly, people, often, associate, their, functional, and, physical, decline, with, the, normal, ageing, process, one, way, to, help, younger, people, experience, what, it, feels, like, to, be, older, is, through, an, ageing, suit, there, are, several, different, kinds, of, suits, including, the, gert, named, as, a, reference, to, gerontology, the, r70i, exoskeleton, and, the, agnes, age, gain, now, empathy, suit, suits, these, suits, create, the, feelings, of, the, effects, of, ageing, by, adding, extra, weight, and, increased, pressure, in, certain, points, like, the, wrists, ankles, and, other, joints, in, addition, the, various, suits, have, different, ways, to, impair, vision, and, hearing, to, simulate, the, loss, of, these, senses, to, create, the, loss, of, feeling, in, hands, that, the, elderly, experience, special, gloves, are, a, part, of, the, uniforms, use, of, these, suits, may, help, to, increase, the, amount, of, empathy, felt, for, the, elderly, and, could, be, considered, particularly, useful, for, those, who, are, either, learning, about, ageing, or, those, who, work, with, the, elderly, such, as, nurses, or, care, centre, staff, design, is, another, field, that, could, benefit, from, the, empathy, these, suits, may, cause, when, designers, understand, what, it, feels, like, to, have, the, impairments, of, old, age, they, can, better, design, buildings, packaging, or, even, tools, to, help, with, the, simple, day, to, day, tasks, that, are, more, difficult, with, less, dexterity, designing, with, the, elderly, in, mind, may, help, to, reduce, the, negative, feelings, that, are, associated, with, the, loss, of, abilities, that, the, elderly, face, the, healthy, ageing, framework, proposed, by, the, world, health, organation, operationalizes, health, as, functional, ability, which, results, from, the, interactions, of, intrinsic, capacity, and, the, environments, intrinsic, capacity, is, a, construct, encompassing, people, s, physical, and, mental, abilities, which, can, be, drawn, upon, during, ageing, intrinsic, capacity, comprises, the, domains, of, cognition, locomotion, vitality, nutrition, psychological, and, sensory, visual, and, hearing, a, recent, study, found, four, profiles, or, statuses, of, intrinsic, capacity, among, older, adults, namely, high, ic, 43, at, baseline, low, deterioration, with, impaired, locomotion, 17, high, deterioration, without, cognitive, impairment, 22, and, high, deterioration, with, cognitive, impairment, 18, over, half, of, the, study, sample, remained, in, the, same, status, at, baseline, and, follow, up, 61, around, one, fourth, of, participants, transitioned, from, the, high, ic, to, the, low, deterioration, status, and, only, 3, of, the, participants, improved, their, status, interestingly, the, probability, of, improvement, was, observed, in, the, status, of, high, deterioration, participants, in, the, latent, statuses, of, low, and, high, levels, of, deterioration, had, a, significantly, higher, risk, of, frailty, disability, and, dementia, than, their, high, ic, counterparts, the, concept, of, successful, ageing, can, be, traced, back, to, the, 1950s, and, was, popularized, in, the, 1980s, traditional, definitions, of, successful, ageing, have, emphasized, absence, of, physical, and, cognitive, disabilities, in, their, 1987, article, rowe, and, kahn, characterized, successful, ageing, as, involving, three, components, a, freedom, from, disease, and, disability, b, high, cognitive, and, physical, functioning, and, c, social, and, productive, engagement, the, study, cited, previous, was, also, done, back, in, 1987, and, therefore, these, factors, associated, with, successful, ageing, have, probably, been, changed, with, the, current, knowledge, scientists, started, to, focus, on, learning, about, the, effect, spirituality, in, successful, ageing, there, are, some, differences, in, cultures, which, of, these, components, are, the, most, important, most, often, across, cultures, social, engagement, was, the, most, highly, rated, but, depending, on, the, culture, the, definition, of, successful, ageing, changes, the, ancient, greek, dramatist, euripides, 5th, century, bc, describes, the, multiple, headed, mythological, monster, hydra, as, having, a, regenerative, capacity, which, makes, it, immortal, which, is, the, historical, background, to, the, name, of, the, biological, genus, hydra, the, book, of, job, c, 6th, century, bc, describes, the, human, lifespan, as, inherently, limited, and, makes, a, comparison, with, the, innate, immortality, that, a, felled, tree, may, have, when, undergoing, vegetative, regeneration, a, man, s, days, are, numbered, you, know, the, number, of, his, months, he, cannot, live, longer, than, the, time, you, have, set, so, now, look, away, from, him, that, he, may, rest, until, he, has, lived, the, time, set, for, him, like, a, man, paid, to, work, for, there, is, hope, for, a, tree, when, it, is, cut, down, that, it, will, grow, again, and, that, its, branches, will, not, stop, growing
