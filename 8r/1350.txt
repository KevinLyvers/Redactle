asthma, is, a, long, term, inflammatory, disease, of, the, airways, of, the, lungs, it, is, characterized, by, variable, and, recurring, symptoms, reversible, airflow, obstruction, and, easily, triggered, bronchospasms, symptoms, include, episodes, of, wheezing, coughing, chest, tightness, and, shortness, of, breath, these, may, occur, a, few, times, a, day, or, a, few, times, per, week, depending, on, the, person, asthma, symptoms, may, become, worse, at, night, or, with, exercise, asthma, is, thought, to, be, caused, by, a, combination, of, genetic, and, environmental, factors, environmental, factors, include, exposure, to, air, pollution, and, allergens, other, potential, triggers, include, medications, such, as, aspirin, and, beta, blockers, diagnosis, is, usually, based, on, the, pattern, of, symptoms, response, to, therapy, over, time, and, spirometry, lung, function, testing, asthma, is, classified, according, to, the, frequency, of, symptoms, of, forced, expiratory, volume, in, one, second, fev, 1, and, peak, expiratory, flow, rate, it, may, also, be, classified, as, atopic, or, non, atopic, where, atopy, refers, to, a, predisposition, toward, developing, a, type, 1, hypersensitivity, reaction, there, is, no, known, cure, for, asthma, but, it, can, be, controlled, symptoms, can, be, prevented, by, avoiding, triggers, such, as, allergens, and, respiratory, irritants, and, suppressed, with, the, use, of, inhaled, corticosteroids, long, acting, beta, agonists, laba, or, antileukotriene, agents, may, be, used, in, addition, to, inhaled, corticosteroids, if, asthma, symptoms, remain, uncontrolled, treatment, of, rapidly, worsening, symptoms, is, usually, with, an, inhaled, short, acting, beta, 2, agonist, such, as, salbutamol, and, corticosteroids, taken, by, mouth, in, very, severe, cases, intravenous, corticosteroids, magnesium, sulfate, and, hospitalization, may, be, required, in, 2019, asthma, affected, approximately, 262, million, people, and, caused, approximately, 461, 000, deaths, most, of, the, deaths, occurred, in, the, developing, world, asthma, often, begins, in, childhood, and, the, rates, have, increased, significantly, since, the, 1960s, asthma, was, recognized, as, early, as, ancient, egypt, the, word, asthma, is, from, the, greek, sthma, which, means, panting, asthma, is, characterized, by, recurrent, episodes, of, wheezing, shortness, of, breath, chest, tightness, and, coughing, sputum, may, be, produced, from, the, lung, by, coughing, but, is, often, hard, to, bring, up, during, recovery, from, an, asthma, attack, exacerbation, the, sputum, may, appear, pus, like, due, to, high, levels, of, white, blood, cells, called, eosinophils, symptoms, are, usually, worse, at, night, and, in, the, early, morning, or, in, response, to, exercise, or, cold, air, some, people, with, asthma, rarely, experience, symptoms, usually, in, response, to, triggers, whereas, others, may, react, frequently, and, readily, and, experience, persistent, symptoms, a, number, of, other, health, conditions, occur, more, frequently, in, people, with, asthma, including, gastroesophageal, reflux, disease, gerd, rhinosinusitis, and, obstructive, sleep, apnea, psychological, disorders, are, also, more, common, with, anxiety, disorders, occurring, in, between, 16, and, 52, and, mood, disorders, in, 14, 41, it, is, not, known, whether, asthma, causes, psychological, problems, or, psychological, problems, lead, to, asthma, current, asthma, but, not, former, asthma, is, associated, with, increased, all, cause, mortality, heart, disease, mortality, and, chronic, lower, respiratory, tract, disease, mortality, asthma, particularly, severe, asthma, is, strongly, associated, with, development, of, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, those, with, asthma, especially, if, it, is, poorly, controlled, are, at, increased, risk, for, radiocontrast, reactions, cavities, occur, more, often, in, people, with, asthma, this, may, be, related, to, the, effect, of, beta, 2, adrenergic, agonists, decreasing, saliva, these, medications, may, also, increase, the, risk, of, dental, erosions, asthma, is, caused, by, a, combination, of, complex, and, incompletely, understood, environmental, and, genetic, interactions, these, influence, both, its, severity, and, its, responsiveness, to, treatment, it, is, believed, that, the, recent, increased, rates, of, asthma, are, due, to, changing, epigenetics, heritable, factors, other, than, those, related, to, the, dna, sequence, and, a, changing, living, environment, asthma, that, starts, before, the, age, of, 12, years, old, is, more, likely, due, to, genetic, influence, while, onset, after, age, 12, is, more, likely, due, to, environmental, influence, many, environmental, factors, have, been, associated, with, asthma, s, development, and, exacerbation, including, allergens, air, pollution, and, other, environmental, chemicals, there, are, some, substances, that, are, known, to, cause, asthma, in, exposed, people, and, they, are, called, asthmagens, some, common, asthmagens, include, ammonia, latex, pesticides, solder, and, welding, fumes, metal, or, wood, dusts, spraying, of, isocyanate, paint, in, vehicle, repair, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, anhydrides, glues, dyes, metal, working, fluids, oil, mists, molds, smoking, during, pregnancy, and, after, delivery, is, associated, with, a, greater, risk, of, asthma, like, symptoms, low, air, quality, from, environmental, factors, such, as, traffic, pollution, or, high, ozone, levels, has, been, associated, with, both, asthma, development, and, increased, asthma, severity, over, half, of, cases, in, children, in, the, united, states, occur, in, areas, when, air, quality, is, below, the, epa, standards, low, air, quality, is, more, common, in, low, income, and, minority, communities, exposure, to, indoor, volatile, organic, compounds, may, be, a, trigger, for, asthma, formaldehyde, exposure, for, example, has, a, positive, association, phthalates, in, certain, types, of, pvc, are, associated, with, asthma, in, both, children, and, adults, while, exposure, to, pesticides, is, linked, to, the, development, of, asthma, a, cause, and, effect, relationship, has, yet, to, be, established, a, meta, analysis, concluded, gas, stoves, are, a, major, risk, factor, for, asthma, finding, around, one, in, eight, cases, in, the, u, s, could, be, attributed, to, these, the, majority, of, the, evidence, does, not, support, a, causal, role, between, paracetamol, acetaminophen, or, antibiotic, use, and, asthma, a, 2014, systematic, review, found, that, the, association, between, paracetamol, use, and, asthma, disappeared, when, respiratory, infections, were, taken, into, account, maternal, psychological, stress, during, pregnancy, is, a, risk, factor, for, the, child, to, develop, asthma, asthma, is, associated, with, exposure, to, indoor, allergens, common, indoor, allergens, include, dust, mites, cockroaches, animal, dander, fragments, of, fur, or, feathers, and, mold, efforts, to, decrease, dust, mites, have, been, found, to, be, ineffective, on, symptoms, in, sensitized, subjects, weak, evidence, suggests, that, efforts, to, decrease, mold, by, repairing, buildings, may, help, improve, asthma, symptoms, in, adults, certain, viral, respiratory, infections, such, as, respiratory, syncytial, virus, and, rhinovirus, may, increase, the, risk, of, developing, asthma, when, acquired, as, young, children, certain, other, infections, however, may, decrease, the, risk, the, hygiene, hypothesis, attempts, to, explain, the, increased, rates, of, asthma, worldwide, as, a, direct, and, unintended, result, of, reduced, exposure, during, childhood, to, non, pathogenic, bacteria, and, viruses, it, has, been, proposed, that, the, reduced, exposure, to, bacteria, and, viruses, is, due, in, part, to, increased, cleanliness, and, decreased, family, size, in, modern, societies, exposure, to, bacterial, endotoxin, in, early, childhood, may, prevent, the, development, of, asthma, but, exposure, at, an, older, age, may, provoke, bronchoconstriction, evidence, supporting, the, hygiene, hypothesis, includes, lower, rates, of, asthma, on, farms, and, in, households, with, pets, use, of, antibiotics, in, early, life, has, been, linked, to, the, development, of, asthma, also, delivery, via, caesarean, section, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, estimated, at, 20, 80, of, asthma, this, increased, risk, is, attributed, to, the, lack, of, healthy, bacterial, colonization, that, the, newborn, would, have, acquired, from, passage, through, the, birth, canal, there, is, a, link, between, asthma, and, the, degree, of, affluence, which, may, be, related, to, the, hygiene, hypothesis, as, less, affluent, individuals, often, have, more, exposure, to, bacteria, and, viruses, family, history, is, a, risk, factor, for, asthma, with, many, different, genes, being, implicated, if, one, identical, twin, is, affected, the, probability, of, the, other, having, the, disease, is, approximately, 25, by, the, end, of, 2005, 25, genes, had, been, associated, with, asthma, in, six, or, more, separate, populations, including, gstm1, il10, ctla, 4, spink5, ltc4s, il4r, and, adam33, among, others, many, of, these, genes, are, related, to, the, immune, system, or, modulating, inflammation, even, among, this, list, of, genes, supported, by, highly, replicated, studies, results, have, not, been, consistent, among, all, populations, tested, in, 2006, over, 100, genes, were, associated, with, asthma, in, one, genetic, association, study, alone, more, continue, to, be, found, some, genetic, variants, may, only, cause, asthma, when, they, are, combined, with, specific, environmental, exposures, an, example, is, a, specific, single, nucleotide, polymorphism, in, the, cd14, region, and, exposure, to, endotoxin, a, bacterial, product, endotoxin, exposure, can, come, from, several, environmental, sources, including, tobacco, smoke, dogs, and, farms, risk, for, asthma, then, is, determined, by, both, a, person, s, genetics, and, the, level, of, endotoxin, exposure, a, triad, of, atopic, eczema, allergic, rhinitis, and, asthma, is, called, atopy, the, strongest, risk, factor, for, developing, asthma, is, a, history, of, atopic, disease, with, asthma, occurring, at, a, much, greater, rate, in, those, who, have, either, eczema, or, hay, fever, asthma, has, been, associated, with, eosinophilic, granulomatosis, with, polyangiitis, formerly, known, as, churg, strauss, syndrome, an, autoimmune, disease, and, vasculitis, individuals, with, certain, types, of, urticaria, may, also, experience, symptoms, of, asthma, there, is, a, correlation, between, obesity, and, the, risk, of, asthma, with, both, having, increased, in, recent, years, several, factors, may, be, at, play, including, decreased, respiratory, function, due, to, a, buildup, of, fat, and, the, fact, that, adipose, tissue, leads, to, a, pro, inflammatory, state, beta, blocker, medications, such, as, propranolol, can, trigger, asthma, in, those, who, are, susceptible, cardioselective, beta, blockers, however, appear, safe, in, those, with, mild, or, moderate, disease, other, medications, that, can, cause, problems, in, asthmatics, are, angiotensin, converting, enzyme, inhibitors, aspirin, and, nsaids, use, of, acid, suppressing, medication, proton, pump, inhibitors, and, h2, blockers, during, pregnancy, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, asthma, in, the, child, some, individuals, will, have, stable, asthma, for, weeks, or, months, and, then, suddenly, develop, an, episode, of, acute, asthma, different, individuals, react, to, various, factors, in, different, ways, most, individuals, can, develop, severe, exacerbation, from, a, number, of, triggering, agents, home, factors, that, can, lead, to, exacerbation, of, asthma, include, dust, animal, dander, especially, cat, and, dog, hair, cockroach, allergens, and, mold, perfumes, are, a, common, cause, of, acute, attacks, in, women, and, children, both, viral, and, bacterial, infections, of, the, upper, respiratory, tract, can, worsen, the, disease, psychological, stress, may, worsen, symptoms, it, is, thought, that, stress, alters, the, immune, system, and, thus, increases, the, airway, inflammatory, response, to, allergens, and, irritants, asthma, exacerbations, in, school, aged, children, peak, in, autumn, shortly, after, children, return, to, school, this, might, reflect, a, combination, of, factors, including, poor, treatment, adherence, increased, allergen, and, viral, exposure, and, altered, immune, tolerance, there, is, limited, evidence, to, guide, possible, approaches, to, reducing, autumn, exacerbations, but, while, costly, seasonal, omalizumab, treatment, from, four, to, six, weeks, before, school, return, may, reduce, autumn, asthma, exacerbations, asthma, is, the, result, of, chronic, inflammation, of, the, conducting, zone, of, the, airways, most, especially, the, bronchi, and, bronchioles, which, subsequently, results, in, increased, contractability, of, the, surrounding, smooth, muscles, this, among, other, factors, leads, to, bouts, of, narrowing, of, the, airway, and, the, classic, symptoms, of, wheezing, the, narrowing, is, typically, reversible, with, or, without, treatment, occasionally, the, airways, themselves, change, typical, changes, in, the, airways, include, an, increase, in, eosinophils, and, thickening, of, the, lamina, reticularis, chronically, the, airways, smooth, muscle, may, increase, in, size, along, with, an, increase, in, the, numbers, of, mucous, glands, other, cell, types, involved, include, t, lymphocytes, macrophages, and, neutrophils, there, may, also, be, involvement, of, other, components, of, the, immune, system, including, cytokines, chemokines, histamine, and, leukotrienes, among, others, while, asthma, is, a, well, recognized, condition, there, is, not, one, universal, agreed, upon, definition, it, is, defined, by, the, global, initiative, for, asthma, as, a, chronic, inflammatory, disorder, of, the, airways, in, which, many, cells, and, cellular, elements, play, a, role, the, chronic, inflammation, is, associated, with, airway, hyper, responsiveness, that, leads, to, recurrent, episodes, of, wheezing, breathlessness, chest, tightness, and, coughing, particularly, at, night, or, in, the, early, morning, these, episodes, are, usually, associated, with, widespread, but, variable, airflow, obstruction, within, the, lung, that, is, often, reversible, either, spontaneously, or, with, treatment, there, is, currently, no, precise, test, for, the, diagnosis, which, is, typically, based, on, the, pattern, of, symptoms, and, response, to, therapy, over, time, asthma, may, be, suspected, if, there, is, a, history, of, recurrent, wheezing, coughing, or, difficulty, breathing, and, these, symptoms, occur, or, worsen, due, to, exercise, viral, infections, allergens, or, air, pollution, spirometry, is, then, used, to, confirm, the, diagnosis, in, children, under, the, age, of, six, the, diagnosis, is, more, difficult, as, they, are, too, young, for, spirometry, spirometry, is, recommended, to, aid, in, diagnosis, and, management, it, is, the, single, best, test, for, asthma, if, the, fev, 1, measured, by, this, technique, improves, more, than, 12, and, increases, by, at, least, 200, milliliters, following, administration, of, a, bronchodilator, such, as, salbutamol, this, is, supportive, of, the, diagnosis, it, however, may, be, normal, in, those, with, a, history, of, mild, asthma, not, currently, acting, up, as, caffeine, is, a, bronchodilator, in, people, with, asthma, the, use, of, caffeine, before, a, lung, function, test, may, interfere, with, the, results, single, breath, diffusing, capacity, can, help, differentiate, asthma, from, copd, it, is, reasonable, to, perform, spirometry, every, one, or, two, years, to, follow, how, well, a, person, s, asthma, is, controlled, the, methacholine, challenge, involves, the, inhalation, of, increasing, concentrations, of, a, substance, that, causes, airway, narrowing, in, those, predisposed, if, negative, it, means, that, a, person, does, not, have, asthma, if, positive, however, it, is, not, specific, for, the, disease, other, supportive, evidence, includes, a, 20, difference, in, peak, expiratory, flow, rate, on, at, least, three, days, in, a, week, for, at, least, two, weeks, a, 20, improvement, of, peak, flow, following, treatment, with, either, salbutamol, inhaled, corticosteroids, or, prednisone, or, a, 20, decrease, in, peak, flow, following, exposure, to, a, trigger, testing, peak, expiratory, flow, is, more, variable, than, spirometry, however, and, thus, not, recommended, for, routine, diagnosis, it, may, be, useful, for, daily, self, monitoring, in, those, with, moderate, to, severe, disease, and, for, checking, the, effectiveness, of, new, medications, it, may, also, be, helpful, in, guiding, treatment, in, those, with, acute, exacerbations, asthma, is, clinically, classified, according, to, the, frequency, of, symptoms, forced, expiratory, volume, in, one, second, fev, 1, and, peak, expiratory, flow, rate, asthma, may, also, be, classified, as, atopic, extrinsic, or, non, atopic, intrinsic, based, on, whether, symptoms, are, precipitated, by, allergens, atopic, or, not, non, atopic, while, asthma, is, classified, based, on, severity, at, the, moment, there, is, no, clear, method, for, classifying, different, subgroups, of, asthma, beyond, this, system, finding, ways, to, identify, subgroups, that, respond, well, to, different, types, of, treatments, is, a, current, critical, goal, of, asthma, research, recently, asthma, has, been, classified, based, on, whether, it, is, associated, with, type, 2, or, non, type, 2, inflammation, this, approach, to, immunologic, classification, is, driven, by, a, developing, understanding, of, the, underlying, immune, processes, and, by, the, development, of, therapeutic, approaches, that, target, type, 2, inflammation, although, asthma, is, a, chronic, obstructive, condition, it, is, not, considered, as, a, part, of, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, as, this, term, refers, specifically, to, combinations, of, disease, that, are, irreversible, such, as, bronchiectasis, and, emphysema, unlike, these, diseases, the, airway, obstruction, in, asthma, is, usually, reversible, however, if, left, untreated, the, chronic, inflammation, from, asthma, can, lead, the, lungs, to, become, irreversibly, obstructed, due, to, airway, remodeling, in, contrast, to, emphysema, asthma, affects, the, bronchi, not, the, alveoli, the, combination, of, asthma, with, a, component, of, irreversible, airway, obstruction, has, been, termed, the, asthma, chronic, obstructive, disease, copd, overlap, syndrome, acos, compared, to, other, people, with, pure, asthma, or, copd, people, with, acos, exhibit, increased, morbidity, mortality, and, possibly, more, comorbidities, an, acute, asthma, exacerbation, is, commonly, referred, to, as, an, asthma, attack, the, classic, symptoms, are, shortness, of, breath, wheezing, and, chest, tightness, the, wheezing, is, most, often, when, breathing, out, while, these, are, the, primary, symptoms, of, asthma, some, people, present, primarily, with, coughing, and, in, severe, cases, air, motion, may, be, significantly, impaired, such, that, no, wheezing, is, heard, in, children, chest, pain, is, often, present, signs, occurring, during, an, asthma, attack, include, the, use, of, accessory, muscles, of, respiration, sternocleidomastoid, and, scalene, muscles, of, the, neck, there, may, be, a, paradoxical, pulse, a, pulse, that, is, weaker, during, inhalation, and, stronger, during, exhalation, and, over, inflation, of, the, chest, a, blue, color, of, the, skin, and, nails, may, occur, from, lack, of, oxygen, in, a, mild, exacerbation, the, peak, expiratory, flow, rate, pefr, is, 200, l, min, or, 50, of, the, predicted, best, moderate, is, defined, as, between, 80, and, 200, l, min, or, 25, and, 50, of, the, predicted, best, while, severe, is, defined, as, 80, l, min, or, 25, of, the, predicted, best, acute, severe, asthma, previously, known, as, status, asthmaticus, is, an, acute, exacerbation, of, asthma, that, does, not, respond, to, standard, treatments, of, bronchodilators, and, corticosteroids, half, of, cases, are, due, to, infections, with, others, caused, by, allergen, air, pollution, or, insufficient, or, inappropriate, medication, use, brittle, asthma, is, a, kind, of, asthma, distinguishable, by, recurrent, severe, attacks, type, 1, brittle, asthma, is, a, disease, with, wide, peak, flow, variability, despite, intense, medication, type, 2, brittle, asthma, is, background, well, controlled, asthma, with, sudden, severe, exacerbations, exercise, can, trigger, bronchoconstriction, both, in, people, with, or, without, asthma, it, occurs, in, most, people, with, asthma, and, up, to, 20, of, people, without, asthma, exercise, induced, bronchoconstriction, is, common, in, professional, athletes, the, highest, rates, are, among, cyclists, up, to, 45, swimmers, and, cross, country, skiers, while, it, may, occur, with, any, weather, conditions, it, is, more, common, when, it, is, dry, and, cold, inhaled, beta, 2, agonists, do, not, appear, to, improve, athletic, performance, among, those, without, asthma, however, oral, doses, may, improve, endurance, and, strength, asthma, as, a, result, of, or, worsened, by, workplace, exposures, is, a, commonly, reported, occupational, disease, many, cases, however, are, not, reported, or, recognized, as, such, it, is, estimated, that, 5, 25, of, asthma, cases, in, adults, are, work, related, a, few, hundred, different, agents, have, been, implicated, with, the, most, common, being, isocyanates, grain, and, wood, dust, colophony, soldering, flux, latex, animals, and, aldehydes, the, employment, associated, with, the, highest, risk, of, problems, include, those, who, spray, paint, bakers, and, those, who, process, food, nurses, chemical, workers, those, who, work, with, animals, welders, hairdressers, and, timber, workers, aspirin, exacerbated, respiratory, disease, aerd, also, known, as, aspirin, induced, asthma, affects, up, to, 9, of, asthmatics, aerd, consists, of, asthma, nasal, polyps, sinus, disease, and, respiratory, reactions, to, aspirin, and, other, nsaid, medications, such, as, ibuprofen, and, naproxen, people, often, also, develop, loss, of, smell, and, most, experience, respiratory, reactions, to, alcohol, alcohol, may, worsen, asthmatic, symptoms, in, up, to, a, third, of, people, this, may, be, even, more, common, in, some, ethnic, groups, such, as, the, japanese, and, those, with, aspirin, exacerbated, respiratory, disease, other, studies, have, found, improvement, in, asthmatic, symptoms, from, alcohol, non, atopic, asthma, also, known, as, intrinsic, or, non, allergic, makes, up, between, 10, and, 33, of, cases, there, is, negative, skin, test, to, common, inhalant, allergens, often, it, starts, later, in, life, and, women, are, more, commonly, affected, than, men, usual, treatments, may, not, work, as, well, the, concept, that, non, atopic, is, synonymous, with, non, allergic, is, called, into, question, by, epidemiological, data, that, the, prevalence, of, asthma, is, closely, related, to, the, serum, ige, level, standardized, for, age, and, sex, p, 0, 0001, indicating, that, asthma, is, almost, always, associated, with, some, sort, of, ige, related, reaction, and, therefore, has, an, allergic, basis, although, not, all, the, allergic, stimuli, that, cause, asthma, appear, to, have, been, included, in, the, battery, of, aeroallergens, studied, the, missing, antigen, s, hypothesis, for, example, an, updated, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, of, population, attributable, risk, par, of, chlamydia, pneumoniae, biomarkers, in, chronic, asthma, found, that, the, par, for, c, pneumoniae, specific, ige, was, 47, infectious, asthma, is, an, easily, identified, clinical, presentation, when, queried, asthma, patients, may, report, that, their, first, asthma, symptoms, began, after, an, acute, lower, respiratory, tract, illness, this, type, of, history, has, been, labelled, the, infectious, asthma, ia, syndrome, or, as, asthma, associated, with, infection, aawi, to, distinguish, infection, associated, asthma, initiation, from, the, well, known, association, of, respiratory, infections, with, asthma, exacerbations, reported, clinical, prevalences, of, ia, for, adults, range, from, around, 40, in, a, primary, care, practice, to, 70, in, a, specialty, practice, treating, mainly, severe, asthma, patients, additional, information, on, the, clinical, prevalence, of, ia, in, adult, onset, asthma, is, unavailable, because, clinicians, are, not, trained, to, elicit, this, type, of, history, routinely, and, recollection, in, child, onset, asthma, is, challenging, a, population, based, incident, case, control, study, in, a, geographically, defined, area, of, finland, reported, that, 35, 8, of, new, onset, asthma, cases, had, experienced, acute, bronchitis, or, pneumonia, in, the, year, preceding, asthma, onset, representing, a, significantly, higher, risk, compared, to, randomly, selected, controls, odds, ratio, 7, 2, 95, confidence, interval, 5, 2, 10, asthma, phenotyping, and, endotyping, has, emerged, as, a, novel, approach, to, asthma, classification, inspired, by, precision, medicine, which, separates, the, clinical, presentations, of, asthma, or, asthma, phenotypes, from, their, underlying, causes, or, asthma, endotypes, the, best, supported, endotypic, distinction, is, the, type, 2, high, type, 2, low, distinction, classification, based, on, type, 2, inflammation, is, useful, in, predicting, which, patients, will, benefit, from, targeted, biologic, therapy, many, other, conditions, can, cause, symptoms, similar, to, those, of, asthma, in, children, symptoms, may, be, due, to, other, upper, airway, diseases, such, as, allergic, rhinitis, and, sinusitis, as, well, as, other, causes, of, airway, obstruction, including, foreign, body, aspiration, tracheal, stenosis, laryngotracheomalacia, vascular, rings, enlarged, lymph, nodes, or, neck, masses, bronchiolitis, and, other, viral, infections, may, also, produce, wheezing, according, to, european, respiratory, society, it, may, not, be, suitable, to, label, wheezing, preschool, children, with, the, term, asthma, because, there, is, lack, of, clinical, data, on, inflammation, in, airways, in, adults, copd, congestive, heart, failure, airway, masses, as, well, as, drug, induced, coughing, due, to, ace, inhibitors, may, cause, similar, symptoms, in, both, populations, vocal, cord, dysfunction, may, present, similarly, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, can, coexist, with, asthma, and, can, occur, as, a, complication, of, chronic, asthma, after, the, age, of, 65, most, people, with, obstructive, airway, disease, will, have, asthma, and, copd, in, this, setting, copd, can, be, differentiated, by, increased, airway, neutrophils, abnormally, increased, wall,

corticosteroids, long, acting, beta, agonists, and, smoking, cessation, it, closely, resembles, asthma, in, symptoms, is, correlated, with, more, exposure, to, cigarette, smoke, an, older, age, less, symptom, reversibility, after, bronchodilator, administration, and, decreased, likelihood, of, family, history, of, atopy, the, evidence, for, the, effectiveness, of, measures, to, prevent, the,

number, of, lower, respiratory, infections, other, efforts, that, show, promise, include, limiting, smoke, exposure, in, utero, breastfeeding, and, increased, exposure, to, daycare, or, large, families, but, none, are, well, supported, enough, to, be, recommended, for, this, indication, early, pet, exposure, may, be, useful, results, from, exposure, to, pets, at, other, times, are, inconclusive, and, it, is, only, recommended, that, pets, be, removed, from, the, home, if, a, person, has, allergic, symptoms, to, said, pet, dietary, restrictions, during, pregnancy, or, when,

organization, smoking, bans, are, effective, in, decreasing, exacerbations, of, asthma, while, there, is, no, cure, for, asthma, symptoms, can, typically, be, improved, the, most, effective, treatment, for, asthma, is, identifying, triggers, such, as, cigarette, smoke, pets, or, other, allergens, and, eliminating, exposure, to, them, if, trigger, avoidance, is, insufficient, the, use, of, medication, is, recommended, pharmaceutical, drugs, are, selected, based, on, among, other, things, the, severity, of, illness, and, the, frequency, of, symptoms, specific, medications, for, asthma, are, broadly, classified, into, fast, acting, and, long, acting, categories, the, medications, listed, below, have, demonstrated, efficacy, in, improving, asthma, symptoms, however, real, world, use, effectiveness, is, limited, as, around, half, of, people, with, asthma, worldwide, remain, sub, optimally, controlled, even, when, treated, people, with, asthma, may, remain, sub, optimally, controlled, either, because, optimum, doses, of, asthma, medications, do, not, work, called, refractory, asthma, or, because, individuals, are, either, unable, e, g, inability, to, afford, treatment, poor, inhaler, technique, or, unwilling, e, g, wish, to, avoid, side, effects, of, corticosteroids, to, take, optimum, doses, of, prescribed, asthma, medications, called, difficult, to, treat, asthma, in, practice, it, is, not, possible, to, distinguish, refractory, from, difficult, to, treat, categories, for, patients, who, have, never, taken, optimum, doses, of, asthma, medications, a, related, issue, is, that, the, asthma, efficacy, trials, upon, which, the, pharmacological, treatment, guidelines, are, based, have, systematically, excluded, the, majority, of, people, with, asthma, for, example, asthma, efficacy, treatment, trials, always, exclude, otherwise, eligible, people, who, smoke, and, smoking, diminishes, the, efficacy, of, inhaled, corticosteroids, the, mainstay, of,

for, those, who, have, daily, attacks, a, higher, dose, of, inhaled, corticosteroids, is, used, in, a, moderate, or, severe, exacerbation, corticosteroids, by, mouth, are, added, to, these, treatments, people, with, asthma, have, higher, rates, of, anxiety, psychological, stress, and, depression, this, is, associated, with, poorer, asthma, control, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, may,

named, as, a, specific, respiratory, problem, by, hippocrates, circa, 450, bc, with, the, greek, word, for, panting, forming, the, basis, of, our, modern, name, in, 200, bc, it, was, believed, to, be, at, least, partly, related, to, the, emotions, in, the, 12th, century, the, jewish, physician, philosopher, maimonides, wrote, a, treatise, on, asthma, in, arabic, based, partly, on, arabic, sources, in, which, he, discussed, the, symptoms, proposed, various, dietary, and, other, means, of, treatment, and, emphasized, the, importance, of, climate, and, clean, air, traditional, chinese, medicine, also, offered, medication, for, asthma, as, indicated, by, a, surviving, 14th, century, manuscript, curated, by, the, wellcome, foundation, in, 1873, one, of, the, first, papers, in, modern, medicine, on, the, subject, tried, to, explain, the, pathophysiology, of, the, disease, while, one, in, 1872, concluded, that, asthma, can, be, cured, by, rubbing, the, chest, with, chloroform, liniment, medical, treatment, in, 1880, included, the, use, of, intravenous, doses, of, a, drug, called, pilocarpine, in, 1886, f, h, bosworth, theorized, a, connection, between, asthma, and, hay, fever, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, focus, was, the, avoidance, of, allergens, as, well, as, selective, beta, 2, adrenoceptor, agonists, were, used, as, treatment, strategies, epinephrine, was, first, referred, to, in, the, treatment, of, asthma, in, 1905, oral, corticosteroids, began, to, be, used, for, the, condition, in, 1950, the, use, of, a, pressurized, metered, dose, inhaler, was, developed, in, the, mid, 1950s, for, the, administration, of, adrenaline, and, isoproterenol, and, was, later, used, as, a, beta, 2, adrenergic, agonist, inhaled, corticosteroids, and, selective, short, acting, beta, agonists, came, into, wide, use, in, the, 1960s, a, well, documented, case, in, the, 19th, century, was, that, of, young, theodore, roosevelt, 1858, 1919, at, that, time, there, was, no, effective, treatment, roosevelt, s, youth, was, in, large, part, shaped, by, his, poor, health, partly, related, to, his, asthma, he, experienced, recurring, nighttime, asthma, attacks, that, felt, as, if, he, was, being, smothered, to, death, terrifying, the, boy, and, his, parents, during, the, 1930s, to, 1950s, asthma, was, known, as, one, of, the, holy, seven, psychosomatic, illnesses, its, cause, was, considered, to, be, psychological, with, treatment, often, based, on, psychoanalysis, and, other, talking, cures, as, these, psychoanalysts, interpreted, the, asthmatic, wheeze, as, the, suppressed, cry, of, the, child, for, its, mother, they, considered, the, treatment, of, depression, to, be, especially, important, for, individuals, with, asthma, in, january, 2021, an, appeal, court, in, france, overturned, a, deportation, order, against, a, 40, year, old, bangladeshi, man, who, was, a, patient, of, asthma, his, lawyers, had, argued, that, the, dangerous, levels, of,
