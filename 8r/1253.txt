smoking, cessation, usually, called, quitting, smoking, or, stopping, smoking, is, the, process, of, discontinuing, tobacco, smoking, tobacco, smoke, contains, nicotine, which, is, addictive, and, can, cause, dependence, as, a, result, nicotine, withdrawal, often, makes, the, process, of, quitting, difficult, smoking, is, the, leading, cause, of, preventable, death, and, a, global, public, health, concern, tobacco, use, leads, most, commonly, to, diseases, affecting, the, heart, and, lungs, with, smoking, being, a, major, risk, factor, for, heart, attacks, strokes, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, idiopathic, pulmonary, fibrosis, ipf, emphysema, and, various, types, and, subtypes, of, cancers, particularly, lung, cancer, cancers, of, the, oropharynx, larynx, and, mouth, esophageal, and, pancreatic, cancer, smoking, cessation, significantly, reduces, the, risk, of, dying, from, smoking, related, diseases, the, risk, of, heart, attack, in, a, smoker, decreases, by, 50, after, one, year, of, cessation, similarly, the, risk, of, lung, cancer, decreases, by, 50, in, 10, years, of, cessation, from, 2001, to, 2010, about, 70, of, smokers, in, the, united, states, expressed, a, desire, to, quit, smoking, and, 50, reported, having, attempted, to, do, so, in, the, past, year, many, strategies, can, be, used, for, smoking, cessation, including, abruptly, quitting, without, assistance, cold, turkey, cutting, down, then, quitting, behavioral, counseling, and, medications, such, as, bupropion, cytisine, nicotine, replacement, therapy, or, varenicline, in, recent, years, especially, in, canada, and, the, united, kingdom, many, smokers, have, switched, to, using, electronic, cigarettes, to, quit, smoking, tobacco, however, a, 2022, study, found, that, 20, of, smokers, who, tried, to, use, e, cigarettes, to, quit, smoking, succeeded, but, 66, of, them, ended, as, dual, users, of, cigarettes, and, vape, products, one, year, out, most, smokers, who, try, to, quit, do, so, without, assistance, however, only, 3, 6, of, quit, attempts, without, assistance, are, successful, long, term, behavioral, counseling, and, medications, each, increase, the, rate, of, successfully, quitting, smoking, and, a, combination, of, behavioral, counseling, with, a, medication, such, as, bupropion, is, more, effective, than, either, intervention, alone, a, meta, analysis, from, 2018, conducted, on, 61, randomized, controlled, trials, showed, that, among, people, who, quit, smoking, with, a, cessation, medication, and, some, behavioral, help, approximately, 20, were, still, nonsmokers, a, year, later, as, compared, to, 12, who, did, not, take, medication, in, nicotine, dependent, smokers, quitting, smoking, can, lead, to, nicotine, withdrawal, symptoms, such, as, nicotine, cravings, anxiety, irritability, depression, and, weight, gain, 2298, professional, smoking, cessation, support, methods, generally, attempt, to, address, nicotine, withdrawal, symptoms, to, help, the, person, break, free, of, nicotine, addiction, it, often, takes, several, attempts, and, potentially, utilizing, different, approaches, each, time, before, achieving, long, term, abstinence, over, 74, 7, of, smokers, attempt, to, quit, without, any, assistance, otherwise, known, as, cold, turkey, or, with, home, remedies, previous, smokers, make, between, an, estimated, 6, to, 30, attempts, before, successfully, quitting, identifying, which, approach, or, technique, is, eventually, most, successful, is, difficult, it, has, been, estimated, for, example, that, only, about, 4, to, 7, of, people, are, able, to, quit, smoking, on, any, given, attempt, without, medicines, or, other, help, the, majority, of, quit, attempts, are, still, unassisted, though, the, trend, seems, to, be, shifting, in, the, u, s, for, example, the, rate, of, unassisted, quitting, fell, from, 91, 8, in, 1986, to, 52, 1, during, 2006, to, 2009, the, most, frequent, unassisted, methods, were, cold, turkey, a, term, that, has, been, used, to, mean, either, unassisted, quitting, or, abrupt, quitting, and, gradually, decreased, number, of, cigarettes, or, cigarette, reduction, cold, turkey, is, a, colloquial, term, indicating, abrupt, withdrawal, from, an, addictive, drug, in, this, context, it, indicates, sudden, and, complete, cessation, of, all, nicotine, use, in, three, studies, it, was, the, quitting, method, cited, by, 76, 85, or, 88, of, long, term, successful, quitters, in, a, large, british, study, of, ex, smokers, in, the, 1980s, before, the, advent, of, pharmacotherapy, 53, of, the, ex, smokers, said, that, it, was, not, at, all, difficult, to, stop, 27, said, it, was, fairly, difficult, and, the, remaining, 20, found, it, very, difficult, studies, have, found, that, two, thirds, of, recent, quitters, reported, using, the, cold, turkey, method, and, found, it, helpful, gradual, reduction, involves, slowly, reducing, one, s, daily, intake, of, nicotine, this, method, can, theoretically, be, accomplished, through, repeated, changes, to, cigarettes, with, lower, nicotine, levels, by, gradually, reducing, the, number, of, cigarettes, smoked, daily, or, by, smoking, only, a, fraction, of, a, cigarette, on, each, occasion, a, 2009, systematic, review, by, researchers, at, the, university, of, birmingham, found, that, gradual, nicotine, replacement, therapy, could, be, effective, in, smoking, cessation, there, is, no, significant, difference, in, quit, rates, between, smokers, who, quit, by, gradual, reduction, or, abrupt, cessation, as, measured, by, abstinence, from, smoking, of, at, least, six, months, from, the, quit, day, the, same, review, also, looked, at, five, pharmacological, aids, for, reduction, when, reducing, the, number, of, smoked, cigarettes, it, found, some, evidence, that, additional, varenicline, or, fast, acting, nicotine, replacement, therapy, can, positively, affect, quitting, for, six, months, or, longer, the, american, cancer, society, notes, that, studies, in, medical, journals, have, reported, that, about, 25, of, smokers, who, use, medicines, can, stay, smoke, free, for, over, 6, months, single, medications, include, the, 2008, us, guideline, specifies, that, three, combinations, of, medications, are, effective, 118, 120, a, meta, analysis, from, 2018, conducted, on, 61, rcts, showed, that, during, their, first, year, of, trying, to, quit, approximately, 80, of, the, participants, in, the, studies, who, got, drug, assistance, bupropion, nrt, or, varenicline, returned, to, smoking, while, 20, continued, to, not, smoke, for, the, entire, year, i, e, remained, sustained, abstinent, in, comparison, 12, the, people, who, got, placebo, kept, from, smoking, for, at, least, an, entire, year, this, makes, the, net, benefit, of, the, drug, treatment, to, be, 8, after, the, first, 12, months, in, other, words, out, of, 100, people, who, will, take, medication, approximately, 8, of, them, would, remain, non, smoking, after, one, year, thanks, to, the, treatment, during, one, year, the, benefit, from, using, smoking, cessation, medications, bupropion, nrt, or, varenicline, decreases, from, 17, in, 3, months, to, 12, in, 6, months, to, 8, in, 12, months, community, interventions, using, multiple, channels, to, provide, reinforcement, support, and, norms, for, not, smoking, may, have, an, effect, on, smoking, cessation, outcomes, among, adults, specific, methods, used, in, the, community, to, encourage, smoking, cessation, among, adults, include, pharmacist, led, interventions, have, proven, to, be, effective, in, helping, smoking, cessation, attempts, many, systematic, reviews, have, looked, at, the, importance, of, pharmacist, involvement, in, malaysia, their, study, looked, at, how, pharmacist, intervention, in, patients, overall, healthcare, showed, improvements, in, screening, early, stages, of, disease, this, allowed, for, earlier, treatment, starts, in, smoking, caused, copd, in, addition, pharmacists, in, malaysia, could, prescribe, nrt, products, and, when, they, led, a, smoking, cessation, service, it, was, more, successful, than, other, smoking, cessation, trials, in, malaysia, it, was, also, shown, that, pharmacist, counselling, and, nrt, products, were, more, effective, in, smoking, cessation, than, using, nrt, alone, in, pharmacist, led, smoking, cessation, services, in, ethiopia, the, study, found, statistically, and, clinically, significant, benefits, favouring, pharmacist, intervention, they, found, that, structured, care, and, regular, visits, easy, accessibility, to, pharmacists, helped, more, people, trying, to, quit, than, without, however, the, study, concluded, that, more, research, should, be, done, in, the, area, as, they, found, an, unknown, risk, of, bias, in, the, studies, included, another, systematic, review, analyzed, pharmacist, intervention, in, smoking, cessation, and, alcohol, and, weight, interventions, they, found, that, evidence, suggests, that, the, longer, the, duration, of, pharmacist, led, intervention, the, more, influential, the, attempt, at, quitting, was, in, addition, they, found, that, community, pharmacists, were, beneficial, in, delivering, public, health, information, pharmacists, have, a, great, reach, in, the, community, to, help, with, smoking, cessation, and, have, proven, to, help, with, lifestyle, modifications, and, proper, nrt, use, most, smoking, cessation, resources, such, as, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, and, the, mayo, clinic, encourage, smokers, to, create, a, quit, plan, including, setting, a, quit, date, which, helps, them, anticipate, and, plan, for, smoking, challenges, a, quit, plan, can, improve, a, smoker, s, chance, of, a, successful, quit, as, can, setting, monday, as, the, quit, date, given, that, research, has, shown, that, monday, more, than, any, other, day, is, when, smokers, are, seeking, information, online, to, quit, smoking, and, calling, state, quitlines, in, nepal, smokers, are, not, selfish, a, health, campaign, of, two, weeks, is, started, on, the, occasion, of, valentine, day, and, vasant, panchami, to, motiviate, individuals, to, quit, smoking, as, a, sacrifice, for, their, loved, ones, and, making, it, a, meaningful, decision, of, life, this, campaign, is, taking, public, attention, self, help, materials, may, produce, a, small, increase, in, quit, rates, specially, when, there, is, no, other, supporting, intervention, form, the, effect, of, self, help, was, weak, and, the, number, of, types, of, self, help, did, not, produce, higher, abstinence, rates, 89, 91, nevertheless, self, help, modalities, for, smoking, cessation, include, various, methods, allow, a, smoker, to, see, the, impact, of, their, tobacco, use, and, the, immediate, effects, of, quitting, using, biochemical, feedback, methods, can, allow, tobacco, users, to, be, identified, and, assessed, and, monitoring, throughout, an, effort, to, quit, can, increase, motivation, to, quit, evidence, wise, little, is, known, about, the, effects, of, using, biomechanical, tests, to, determine, a, person, s, risk, related, to, smoking, cessation, while, both, measures, offer, high, sensitivity, and, specificity, they, differ, in, usage, method, and, cost, for, example, breath, co, monitoring, is, non, invasive, while, cotinine, testing, relies, on, bodily, fluid, for, instance, these, two, methods, can, be, used, alone, or, together, when, abstinence, verification, needs, additional, confirmation, financial, or, material, incentives, to, entice, people, to, quit, smoking, improve, smoking, cessation, while, the, motivation, is, in, place, competitions, that, require, participants, to, deposit, their, own, money, betting, that, they, will, succeed, in, quitting, smoking, appear, to, be, an, effective, incentive, however, it, is, more, difficult, to, recruit, participants, for, this, type, of, contest, in, head, to, head, comparisons, with, other, incentive, models, such, as, giving, participants, nrt, or, placing, them, in, a, more, typical, rewards, program, evidence, shows, that, incentive, programs, may, be, effective, for, pregnant, mothers, who, smoke, as, of, 2019, there, is, an, insufficient, number, of, studies, on, quit, and, win, and, other, competition, based, interventions, and, results, from, the, existing, studies, were, inconclusive, a, 2008, cochrane, review, of, smoking, cessation, activities, in, work, places, concluded, that, interventions, directed, towards, individual, smokers, increase, the, likelihood, of, quitting, smoking, a, 2010, systematic, review, determined, that, worksite, incentives, and, competitions, needed, to, be, combined, with, additional, interventions, to, produce, significant, increases, in, smoking, cessation, rates, interventions, delivered, via, healthcare, providers, and, healthcare, systems, have, been, shown, to, improve, smoking, cessation, among, people, who, visit, those, services, it, is, important, to, note, that, most, of, the, alternative, approaches, below, have, minimal, evidence, to, support, their, use, and, their, efficacy, and, safety, should, be, discussed, with, a, healthcare, professional, before, starting, methods, used, with, children, and, adolescents, include, cochrane, reviews, mainly, of, studies, combining, motivational, enhancement, and, psychological, support, concluded, that, complex, approaches, for, smoking, cessation, among, young, people, show, promise, the, 2008, us, guideline, recommends, counselling, style, support, for, adolescent, smokers, on, the, basis, of, a, meta, analysis, of, seven, studies, 159, 161, neither, the, cochrane, review, nor, the, 2008, guideline, recommend, medications, for, adolescents, who, smoke, smoking, during, pregnancy, can, cause, adverse, health, effects, in, both, the, woman, and, the, fetus, the, 2008, us, guideline, determined, that, person, to, person, psychosocial, interventions, typically, including, intensive, counseling, increased, abstinence, rates, in, pregnant, women, who, smoke, to, 13, 3, compared, with, 7, 6, in, usual, care, 165, 167, mothers, who, smoke, during, pregnancy, have, a, greater, tendency, towards, premature, births, their, babies, are, often, underdeveloped, have, smaller, organs, and, weigh, much, less, than, the, average, baby, weight, in, addition, these, babies, have, weaker, immune, systems, making, them, more, susceptible, to, many, diseases, such, as, middle, ear, inflammations, and, asthmatic, bronchitis, as, well, as, metabolic, conditions, such, as, diabetes, and, hypertension, all, of, which, can, bring, significant, morbidity, additionally, a, study, published, by, american, academy, of, pediatrics, shows, that, smoking, during, pregnancy, increases, the, chance, of, sudden, unexpected, infant, death, suid, or, sids, there, is, also, an, increased, chance, that, the, child, will, be, a, smoker, in, adulthood, a, systematic, review, showed, that, psychosocial, interventions, help, women, quit, smoking, in, late, pregnancy, and, can, reduce, the, incidence, of, low, birth, weight, infants, it, is, a, myth, that, a, female, smoker, can, cause, harm, to, a, fetus, by, quitting, immediately, upon, discovering, she, is, pregnant, this, idea, is, not, based, on, any, medical, study, or, fact, in, a, uk, study, that, included, 1140, pregnant, women, e, cigarettes, were, found, to, be, as, effective, as, nicotine, patches, at, helping, pregnant, women, to, quit, smoking, the, safety, of, the, two, products, was, also, similar, however, life, style, modification, are, the, preferred, method, for, pregnant, women, and, they, should, discuss, smoking, cessation, techniques, with, a, healthcare, professional, studies, across, 20, countries, show, a, strong, association, between, patients, with, schizophrenia, and, smoking, people, with, schizophrenia, are, much, more, likely, to, smoke, than, those, without, the, disease, for, example, in, the, united, states, 80, or, more, of, people, with, schizophrenia, smoke, compared, to, 20, of, the, general, population, in, 2006, smokers, who, are, hospitalised, may, be, particularly, motivated, to, quit, 149, 150, a, 2012, cochrane, review, found, that, interventions, beginning, during, a, hospital, stay, and, continuing, for, one, month, or, more, after, discharge, were, effective, in, producing, abstinence, patients, undergoing, elective, surgery, may, get, benefits, of, preoperative, smoking, cessation, interventions, when, starting, 4, 8, weeks, before, surgery, with, weekly, counseling, for, behavioral, support, and, use, of, nicotine, replacement, therapy, it, is, found, to, reduce, the, complications, and, the, number, of, postoperative, morbidity, people, with, mood, disorders, or, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorders, have, a, greater, chance, to, begin, smoking, and, a, lower, chance, of, quitting, smoking, a, higher, correlation, with, smoking, has, also, been, seen, in, people, diagnosed, with, the, major, depressive, disorder, at, any, time, throughout, their, lifetime, compared, to, those, without, it, success, rates, in, quitting, smoking, were, lower, for, those, with, a, major, depressive, disorder, diagnosis, versus, people, without, the, diagnosis, exposure, to, cigarette, smoke, early, on, in, life, during, pregnancy, infancy, or, adolescence, may, negatively, impact, a, child, s, neurodevelopment, and, increase, the, risk, of, developing, anxiety, disorders, in, the, future, homelessness, doubles, the, likelihood, of, an, individual, currently, being, a, smoker, homelessness, is, independent, of, other, socioeconomic, factors, and, behavioral, health, conditions, homeless, individuals, have, the, same, rates, of, desire, to, quit, smoking, still, they, are, less, likely, than, the, general, population, to, attempt, to, stop, successfully, in, the, united, states, 60, 80, of, homeless, adults, are, smokers, this, is, a, considerably, higher, rate, than, the, general, adult, population, of, 19, many, current, smokers, who, are, homeless, report, smoking, as, a, means, of, coping, with, all, the, pressure, of, being, homeless, the, perception, that, homeless, people, smoking, being, socially, acceptable, can, reinforce, these, trends, americans, under, the, poverty, line, have, higher, rates, of, smoking, and, lower, rates, of, quitting, than, those, over, the, poverty, line, while, the, homeless, population, is, concerned, about, short, term, effects, of, smoking, such, as, shortness, of, breath, or, recurrent, bronchitis, they, are, not, as, concerned, with, long, term, consequences, the, homeless, population, has, unique, barriers, to, quitting, smoking, such, as, unstructured, days, the, stress, of, finding, a, job, and, immediate, survival, needs, that, supersede, the, desire, to, quit, smoking, these, unique, barriers, can, be, combated, through, pharmacotherapy, and, behavioral, counseling, for, high, levels, of, nicotine, dependence, the, emphasis, of, immediate, financial, benefits, to, those, who, concern, themselves, with, the, short, term, over, the, long, term, partnering, with, shelters, to, reduce, the, social, acceptability, of, smoking, in, this, population, and, increased, taxes, on, cigarettes, and, alternative, tobacco, products, to, further, make, the, addiction, more, difficult, to, fund, over, three, quarters, of, people, in, treatment, or, recovery, from, substance, misuse, issues, are, current, smokers, providing, behavioural, interventions, such, as, counseling, and, advice, and, pharmacotherapy, including, nicotine, replacement, therapy, such, as, the, use, of, patches, or, gum, varenicline, and, or, bupropion, increase, tobacco, abstinence, that, is, sustainable, and, also, reduces, the, risk, of, returning, to, other, substance, use, comparison, of, success, rates, across, interventions, can, be, difficult, because, of, different, definitions, of, success, across, studies, robert, west, and, saul, shiffman, authorities, in, this, field, recognized, by, government, health, departments, in, a, number, of, countries, 73, 76, 80, have, concluded, that, used, together, behavioral, support, and, medication, can, quadruple, the, chances, that, a, quit, attempt, will, be, successful, a, 2008, systematic, review, in, the, european, journal, of, cancer, prevention, found, that, group, behavioural, therapy, was, the, most, effective, intervention, strategy, for, smoking, cessation, followed, by, bupropion, intensive, physician, advice, nicotine, replacement, therapy, individual, counselling, telephone, counselling, nursing, interventions, and, tailored, self, help, interventions, the, study, did, not, discuss, varenicline, quitting, can, be, harder, for, individuals, with, darkly, pigmented, skin, than, individuals, with, pale, skin, since, nicotine, has, an, affinity, for, melanin, containing, tissues, studies, suggest, this, can, cause, the, phenomenon, of, increased, nicotine, dependence, and, lower, smoking, cessation, rate, in, darker, pigmented, individuals, there, is, an, important, social, component, to, smoking, the, spread, of, smoking, cessation, from, person, to, person, contributes, to, the, decrease, in, smoking, among, different, populations, or, groups, a, 2008, study, of, a, densely, interconnected, network, of, over, 12, 000, individuals, found, that, smoking, cessation, by, any, given, individual, reduced, the, chances, of, others, around, them, lighting, up, by, the, following, amounts, a, spouse, by, 67, a, sibling, by, 25, a, friend, by, 36, and, a, coworker, by, 34, nevertheless, a, cochrane, review, determined, that, interventions, to, increase, social, support, for, a, smoker, s, cessation, attempt, did, not, improve, long, term, quit, rates, smokers, trying, to, quit, are, faced, with, social, influences, that, may, persuade, them, to, conform, and, continue, smoking, cravings, are, easier, to, detain, when, one, s, environment, does, not, provoke, the, habit, suppose, a, person, who, stopped, smoking, has, close, relationships, with, active, smokers, in, that, case, they, are, often, put, into, situations, that, make, the, urge, to, conform, more, tempting, however, in, a, small, group, with, at, least, one, other, not, smoking, the, likelihood, of, conformity, decreases, the, social, influence, of, smoking, cigarettes, has, been, proven, to, rely, on, simple, variables, one, researched, variable, depends, on, whether, there, is, influence, from, a, friend, or, non, friend, the, research, shows, that, individuals, are, 77, more, likely, to, conform, to, non, friends, while, close, friendships, decrease, conformity, therefore, if, an, acquaintance, offers, a, cigarette, as, a, polite, gesture, the, person, who, has, stopped, smoking, will, be, likelier, to, break, his, commitment, than, if, a, friend, had, suggested, it, recent, research, from, the, international, tobacco, control, itc, four, country, survey, of, over, 6, 000, smokers, found, that, smokers, with, fewer, smoking, friends, were, more, likely, to, intend, to, quit, and, to, succeed, in, their, quit, attempt, expectations, and, attitude, are, significant, factors, a, self, perpetuating, cycle, occurs, when, a, person, feels, bad, for, smoking, yet, smokes, to, alleviate, feeling, bad, breaking, that, cycle, can, be, a, key, in, changing, the, sabotaging, attitude, smokers, with, major, depressive, disorder, may, be, less, successful, at, quitting, smoking, than, non, depressed, smokers, 81, relapse, resuming, smoking, after, quitting, has, been, related, to, psychological, issues, such, as, low, self, efficacy, or, non, optimal, coping, responses, however, psychological, approaches, to, prevent, relapse, have, not, been, proven, to, be, successful, in, contrast, varenicline, is, suggested, to, have, some, effects, and, nicotine, replacement, therapy, may, help, the, unassisted, abstainers, the, cdc, recognizes, seven, common, nicotine, withdrawal, symptoms, that, people, often, face, when, stopping, smoking, cravings, to, smoke, feeling, irritated, grouchy, or, upset, feeling, jumpy, and, restless, having, a, hard, time, concentrating, having, trouble, sleeping, feeling, hungry, or, gaining, weight, or, feeling, anxious, sad, or, depressed, studies, have, shown, that, the, use, of, pharmacotherapies, such, as, varenicline, can, be, useful, in, reducing, withdrawal, symptoms, during, the, quitting, process, giving, up, smoking, is, associated, with, an, average, weight, gain, of, 4, 5, kilograms, 8, 8, 11, 0, lb, after, 12, months, most, of, which, occurs, within, the, first, three, months, of, quitting, the, possible, causes, of, the, weight, gain, include, the, u, s, department, of, health, and, human, services, guideline, suggests, that, sustained, release, bupropion, nicotine, gum, and, nicotine, lozenge, be, used, to, delay, weight, gain, after, quitting, there, is, not, currently, enough, evidence, to, suggest, one, method, of, weight, loss, works, better, than, others, in, preventing, weight, gain, during, the, smoking, cessation, process, it, is, helpful, to, reach, for, healthy, snacks, such, as, celery, and, carrots, to, aid, in, the, increased, appetite, while, also, helping, to, limit, weight, gain, regardless, of, post, cessation, weight, gain, there, is, a, significant, decrease, in, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, in, those, who, have, quit, smoking, the, risks, of, rebound, weight, gain, is, significantly, less, than, the, risks, of, continued, smoking, like, other, physically, addictive, drugs, nicotine, addiction, causes, a, down, regulation, of, the, production, of, dopamine, and, other, stimulatory, neurotransmitters, as, the, brain, attempts, to, compensate, for, the, artificial, stimulation, caused, by, smoking, some, studies, from, the, 1990s, found, that, when, people, stop, smoking, depressive, symptoms, such, as, suicidal, tendencies, or, actual, depression, may, result, although, a, recent, international, study, comparing, smokers, who, had, stopped, for, 3, months, with, continuing, smokers, found, that, stopping, smoking, did, not, appear, to, increase, anxiety, or, depression, a, 2021, review, found, that, quitting, smoking, lessens, anxiety, and, depression, a, 2013, study, by, the, british, journal, of, psychiatry, has, found, that, smokers, who, successfully, quit, feel, less, anxious, afterward, with, the, effect, being, greater, among, those, who, had, mood, and, anxiety, disorders, than, those, who, smoked, for, pleasure, many, of, tobacco, s, detrimental, health, effects, can, be, reduced, or, largely, removed, through, smoking, cessation, the, health, benefits, over, time, of, stopping, smoking, include, the, british, doctors, study, showed, that, those, who, stopped, smoking, before, they, reached, 30, years, old, lived, almost, as, long, as, those, who, never, smoked, stopping, in, one, s, sixties, can, still, add, three, years, of, healthy, life, randomized, u, s, and, canadian, trials, showed, that, a, ten, week, smoking, cessation, program, decreased, mortality, from, all, causes, over, 14,
