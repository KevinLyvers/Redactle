a, goose, pl, geese, is, a, bird, of, any, of, several, waterfowl, species, in, the, family, anatidae, this, group, comprises, the, genera, anser, grey, geese, and, white, geese, and, branta, black, geese, some, members, of, the, tadorninae, subfamily, e, g, egyptian, goose, orinoco, goose, are, commonly, called, geese, but, are, not, considered, true, geese, taxonomically, more, distantly, related, members, of, the, family, anatidae, are, swans, most, of, which, are, larger, than, true, geese, and, ducks, which, are, smaller, the, term, goose, may, refer, to, such, bird, of, either, sex, but, when, paired, with, gander, refers, specifically, to, a, female, one, the, latter, referring, to, a, male, young, birds, before, fledging, are, called, goslings, the, collective, noun, for, a, group, of, geese, on, the, ground, is, a, gaggle, when, in, flight, they, are, called, a, skein, a, team, or, a, wedge, when, flying, close, together, they, are, called, a, plump, the, word, goose, is, a, direct, descendant, of, proto, indo, european, h, ns, in, germanic, languages, the, root, gave, old, english, g, s, with, the, plural, g, s, and, gandra, becoming, modern, english, goose,

and, white, geese, such, as, the, greylag, goose, and, snow, goose, and, branta, black, geese, such, as, the, canada, goose, two, genera, of, geese, are, only, tentatively, placed, in, the, anserinae, they, may, belong, to, the, shelducks, or, form, a, subfamily, on, their, own, cereopsis, the, cape, barren, goose, and, cnemiornis, the, prehistoric, new, zealand, goose, either, these, or, more, probably, the, goose, like, coscoroba, swan, is, the, closest, living, relative, of, the, true, geese, fossils, of, true, geese, are, hard, to, assign, to, genus, all, that, can, be, said, is, that, their, fossil, record, particularly, in, north, america, is, dense, and, comprehensively, documents, many, different, species, of, true, geese, that, have, been, around, since, about, 10, million, years, ago, in, the, miocene, the, aptly, named, anser, atavus, meaning, progenitor, goose, from, some, 12, million, years, ago, had, even, more, plesiomorphies, in, common, with, swans, in, addition, some, goose, like, birds, are, known, from, subfossil, remains, found, on, the, hawaiian, islands, geese, are, monogamous, living, in, permanent, pairs, throughout, the, year, however, unlike, most, other, permanently, monogamous, animals, they, are, territorial, only, during, the, short, nesting, season, paired, geese, are, more, dominant, and, feed, more, two, factors, that, result, in, more, young, goose, fossils, have, been, found, ranging, from, 10, to, 12, million, years, ago, middle, miocene, garganornis, ballmanni, from, late, miocene, 6, 9, ma, of, gargano, region, of, central, italy, stood, one, and, a, half, meters, tall, and, weighed, about, 22, kilograms, the, evidence, suggests, the, bird, was, flightless, unlike, modern, geese, most, goose, species, are, migratory, though, populations, of, canada, geese, living, near, human, developments, may, remain, in, a, locality, year, round, these, resident, geese, found, primarily, in, the, eastern, united, states, may, migrate, only, short, distances, or, not, at, all, if, they, have, adequate, food, supply, and, access, to, open, water, migratory, geese, may, use, several, environmental, cues, in, timing, the, beginning, of, their, migration, including, temperature, predation, threat, and, food, availability, like, all, migratory, birds, geese, exhibit, an, ability, to, navigate, using, an, internal, compass, using, a, combination, of, innate, and, learned, behaviors, the, preferred, direction, of, migration, is, heritable, and, birds, appear, to, orient, themselves, using, earth, s, magnetic, field, migrations, occur, over, the, course, of, several, weeks, and, up, to, 85, of, migration, time, is, spent, at, perennial, stopover, sites, where, individuals, rest, and, build, up, fat, stores, for, further, travel, geese, like, other, birds, fly, in, a, v, formation, this, formation, helps, to, conserve, energy, in, flight, and, aids, in, communication, and, monitoring, of, flock, mates, using, great, white, pelicans, as, a, model, species, researchers, showed, that, flying, in, a, v, formation, increased, the, aerodynamics, of, trailing, birds, thus, requiring, fewer, wing, flaps, to, stay, aloft, and, lowering, individuals, heartrates, leading, geese, switch, positions, on, longer, flights, to, allow, for, multiple, individuals, to, gain, benefits, from, the, less, energy, intensive, trailing, positions, in, family, groups, parental, birds, almost, always, lead, some, mainly, southern, hemisphere, birds, are, called, geese, most, of, which, belong, to, the, shelduck, subfamily, tadorninae, these, are, others, the, oldest, collection, of, medieval, icelandic, laws, is, known, as, gr, g, s, i, e, the, gray, goose, laws, various, etymologies, were, offered, for, that, name
