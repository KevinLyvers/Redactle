emergency, medical, services, ems, also, known, as, ambulance, services, or, paramedic, services, are, emergency, services, that, provide, urgent, pre, hospital, treatment, and, stabilisation, for, serious, illness, and, injuries, and, transport, to, definitive, care, they, may, also, be, known, as, a, first, aid, squad, fast, squad, emergency, squad, ambulance, squad, ambulance, corps, life, squad, or, by, other, initialisms, such, as, emas, or, emars, in, most, places, ems, can, be, summoned, by, members, of, the, public, as, well, as, medical, facilities, other, emergency, services, businesses, and, authorities, via, an, emergency, telephone, number, such, as, 911, in, the, united, states, which, puts, them, in, contact, with, a, dispatching, centre, which, will, then, dispatch, suitable, resources, for, the, call, ambulances, are, the, primary, vehicles, for, delivering, ems, though, squad, cars, motorcycles, aircraft, boats, fire, apparatus, and, others, may, be, used, ems, agencies, may, also, operate, a, non, emergency, patient, transport, service, and, some, have, rescue, squads, to, provide, technical, rescue, or, search, and, rescue, services, when, ems, is, dispatched, they, will, initiate, medical, care, upon, arrival, on, scene, if, it, is, deemed, necessary, or, a, patient, requests, transport, the, unit, is, then, tasked, with, transferring, the, patient, to, the, next, point, of, care, typically, an, emergency, department, of, a, hospital, historically, ambulances, only, transported, patients, to, care, and, this, remains, the, case, in, parts, of, the, developing, world, the, term, emergency, medical, service, was, popularised, when, these, services, began, to, emphasise, emergency, treatment, at, the, scene, in, some, countries, a, substantial, portion, of, ems, calls, do, not, result, in, a, patient, being, taken, to, hospital, training, and, qualification, levels, for, members, and, employees, of, emergency, medical, services, vary, widely, throughout, the, world, in, some, systems, members, may, be, present, who, are, qualified, only, to, drive, ambulances, with, no, medical, training, in, contrast, most, systems, have, personnel, who, retain, at, least, basic, first, aid, certifications, such, as, basic, life, support, bls, in, english, speaking, countries, they, are, known, as, emergency, medical, technicians, emts, and, paramedics, with, the, latter, having, additional, training, such, as, advanced, life, support, als, skills, physicians, and, nurses, may, also, provide, pre, hospital, care, to, varying, degrees, in, certain, countries, a, model, which, is, popular, in, europe, emergency, care, in, the, field, has, been, rendered, in, different, forms, since, the, beginning, of, recorded, history, the, new, testament, contains, the, parable, of, the, good, samaritan, in, which, a, man, who, has, been, beaten, is, cared, for, by, a, passing, samaritan, luke, 10, 34, niv, he, went, to, him, and, bandaged, his, wounds, pouring, on, oil, and, wine, then, he, put, the, man, on, his, own, donkey, took, him, to, an, inn, and, took, care, of, him, during, the, middle, ages, the, knights, hospitaller, were, known, for, rendering, assistance, to, wounded, soldiers, in, the, battlefield, the, first, use, of, the, ambulance, as, a, specialized, vehicle, in, battle, came, about, with, the, ambulances, volantes, designed, by, dominique, jean, larrey, 1766, 1842, napoleon, bonaparte, s, chief, surgeon, larrey, was, present, at, the, battle, of, spires, between, the, french, and, prussians, and, was, distressed, by, the, fact, that, wounded, soldiers, were, not, picked, up, by, the, numerous, ambulances, which, napoleon, required, to, be, stationed, two, and, half, miles, back, from, the, scene, of, battle, until, after, hostilities, had, ceased, and, set, about, developing, a, new, ambulance, system, having, decided, against, using, the, norman, system, of, horse, litters, he, settled, on, two, or, four, wheeled, horse, drawn, wagons, which, were, used, to, transport, fallen, soldiers, from, the, active, battlefield, after, they, had, received, early, treatment, in, the, field, larrey, s, projects, for, flying, ambulances, were, first, approved, by, the, committee, of, public, safety, in, 1794, larrey, subsequently, entered, napoleon, s, service, during, the, italian, campaigns, in, 1796, where, his, ambulances, were, used, for, the, first, time, at, udine, padua, and, milan, and, he, adapted, his, ambulances, to, the, conditions, even, developing, a, litter, which, could, be, carried, by, a, camel, for, a, campaign, in, egypt, a, major, advance, was, made, which, in, future, years, would, come, to, shape, policy, on, hospitals, and, ambulances, with, the, introduction, of, a, transport, carriage, for, cholera, patients, in, london, during, 1832, the, statement, on, the, carriage, as, printed, in, the, times, said, the, curative, process, commences, the, instant, the, patient, is, put, in, to, the, carriage, time, is, saved, which, can, be, given, to, the, care, of, the, patient, the, patient, may, be, driven, to, the, hospital, so, speedily, that, the, hospitals, may, be, less, numerous, and, located, at, greater, distances, from, each, other, this, tenet, of, ambulances, providing, instant, care, allowing, hospitals, to, be, spaced, further, apart, displays, itself, in, modern, emergency, medical, planning, the, first, known, hospital, based, ambulance, service, operated, out, of, commercial, hospital, cincinnati, ohio, now, the, cincinnati, general, by, 1865, this, was, soon, followed, by, other, services, notably, the, new, york, service, provided, out, of, bellevue, hospital, which, started, in, 1869, with, ambulances, carrying, medical, equipment, such, as, splints, a, stomach, pump, morphine, and, brandy, reflecting, contemporary, medicine, another, early, ambulance, service, was, founded, by, jaromir, v, mundy, count, j, n, wilczek, and, eduard, lamezan, salins, in, vienna, after, the, disastrous, fire, at, the, vienna, ringtheater, in, 1881, named, the, vienna, voluntary, rescue, society, it, served, as, a, model, for, similar, societies, worldwide, in, june, 1887, the, st, john, ambulance, brigade, was, established, to, provide, first, aid, and, ambulance, services, at, public, events, in, london, it, was, modelled, on, a, military, style, command, and, discipline, structure, also, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, automobile, was, being, developed, and, in, addition, to, horse, drawn, models, early, 20th, century, ambulances, were, powered, by, steam, gasoline, and, electricity, reflecting, the, competing, automotive, technologies, then, in, existence, however, the, first, motorized, ambulance, was, brought, into, service, in, the, last, year, of, the, 19th, century, with, the, michael, reese, hospital, chicago, taking, delivery, of, the, first, automobile, ambulance, donated, by, 500, prominent, local, businessmen, in, february, 1899, this, was, followed, in, 1900, by, new, york, city, who, extolled, its, virtues, of, greater, speed, more, safety, for, the, patient, faster, stopping, and, a, smoother, ride, these, first, two, automobile, ambulances, were, electrically, powered, with, 2, hp, motors, on, the, rear, axle, during, world, war, i, further, advances, were, made, in, providing, care, before, and, during, transport, traction, splints, were, introduced, during, the, war, and, were, found, to, have, a, positive, effect, on, the, morbidity, and, mortality, of, patients, with, leg, fractures, two, way, radios, became, available, shortly, after, world, war, i, enabling, for, more, efficient, radio, dispatch, of, ambulances, in, some, areas, prior, to, world, war, ii, there, were, some, areas, where, a, modern, ambulance, carried, advanced, medical, equipment, was, staffed, by, a, physician, and, was, dispatched, by, radio, in, many, locations, however, ambulances, were, hearses, the, only, available, vehicle, that, could, carry, a, recumbent, patient, and, were, thus, frequently, run, by, funeral, homes, these, vehicles, which, could, serve, either, purpose, were, known, as, combination, cars, prior, to, world, war, ii, hospitals, provided, ambulance, service, in, many, large, cities, with, the, severe, manpower, shortages, imposed, by, the, war, effort, it, became, difficult, for, many, hospitals, to, maintain, their, ambulance, operations, city, governments, in, many, cases, turned, ambulance, services, over, to, the, police, or, fire, department, no, laws, required, minimal, training, for, ambulance, personnel, and, no, training, programs, existed, beyond, basic, first, aid, in, many, fire, departments, assignment, to, ambulance, duty, became, an, unofficial, form, of, punishment, advances, in, the, 1960s, especially, the, development, of, cpr, and, defibrillation, as, the, standard, form, of, care, for, out, of, hospital, cardiac, arrest, along, with, new, pharmaceuticals, led, to, changes, in, the, tasks, of, the, ambulances, in, belfast, northern, ireland, the, first, experimental, mobile, coronary, care, ambulance, successfully, resuscitated, patients, using, these, technologies, freedom, house, ambulance, service, was, the, first, civilian, emergency, medical, service, in, the, united, states, to, be, staffed, by, paramedics, all, of, whom, were, african, american, one, well, known, report, in, the, us, during, that, time, was, accidental, death, and, disability, the, neglected, disease, of, modern, society, also, known, as, the, white, paper, the, report, concluded, that, ambulance, services, in, the, us, varied, widely, in, quality, and, were, often, unregulated, and, unsatisfactory, these, studies, placed, pressure, on, governments, to, improve, emergency, care, in, general, including, the, care, provided, by, ambulance, services, the, government, reports, resulted, in, the, creation, of, standards, in, ambulance, construction, concerning, the, internal, height, of, the, patient, care, area, to, allow, for, an, attendant, to, continue, to, care, for, the, patient, during, transport, and, the, equipment, and, thus, weight, that, an, ambulance, had, to, carry, and, several, other, factors, in, 1971, a, progress, report, was, published, at, the, annual, meeting, by, the, then, president, of, american, association, of, trauma, sawnie, r, gaston, m, d, dr, gaston, reported, the, study, was, a, superb, white, paper, that, jolted, and, wakened, the, entire, structure, of, organized, medicine, this, report, is, created, as, a, prime, mover, and, made, the, single, greatest, contribution, of, its, kind, to, the, improvement, of, emergency, medical, services, since, this, time, a, concerted, effort, has, been, undertaken, to, improve, emergency, medical, care, in, the, pre, hospital, setting, such, advancements, included, dr, r, adams, cowley, creating, the, country, s, first, statewide, ems, program, in, maryland, the, developments, were, paralleled, in, other, countries, in, the, united, kingdom, a, 1973, law, merged, the, municipal, ambulance, services, into, larger, agencies, and, set, national, standards, in, france, the, first, official, samu, agencies, were, founded, in, the, 1970s, depending, on, country, area, within, country, or, clinical, need, emergency, medical, services, may, be, provided, by, one, or, more, different, types, of, organization, this, variation, may, lead, to, large, differences, in, levels, of, care, and, expected, scope, of, practice, some, countries, closely, regulate, the, industry, and, may, require, anyone, working, on, an, ambulance, to, be, qualified, to, a, set, level, whereas, others, allow, quite, wide, differences, between, types, of, operator, operating, separately, from, although, alongside, the, fire, and, police, services, of, the, area, these, ambulances, are, funded, by, local, provincial, or, national, governments, in, some, countries, these, only, tend, to, be, found, in, big, cities, whereas, in, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, almost, all, emergency, ambulances, are, part, of, a, national, health, system, in, the, united, states, ambulance, services, provided, by, a, local, government, are, often, referred, to, as, third, service, ems, the, fire, department, police, department, and, ems, department, forming, an, emergency, services, trio, by, the, members, of, said, service, as, well, as, other, city, officials, and, residents, the, most, notable, examples, of, this, model, in, the, united, states, are, pittsburgh, bureau, of, emergency, medical, services, boston, ems, new, orleans, emergency, medical, services, and, cleveland, ems, government, ambulance, services, also, have, to, take, civil, service, exams, just, like, government, fire, departments, and, police, in, the, united, states, certain, federal, government, agencies, employ, emergency, medical, technicians, at, the, basic, and, advanced, life, support, levels, such, as, the, national, park, service, and, the, federal, bureau, of, prisons, in, countries, such, as, the, united, states, japan, france, south, korea, and, parts, of, india, ambulances, can, be, operated, by, the, local, fire, or, police, services, fire, based, ems, is, the, most, common, model, in, the, united, states, where, nearly, all, urban, fire, departments, provide, ems, and, a, majority, of, emergency, transport, ambulance, services, in, large, cities, are, part, of, fire, departments, examples, of, this, model, are, the, new, york, city, fire, department, fdny, and, the, baltimore, city, fire, department, it, is, rare, for, a, police, department, in, the, united, states, to, provide, ems, or, ambulance, services, although, many, police, officers, have, basic, medical, training, such, as, nalaxone, use, and, cpr, one, notable, example, is, new, orleans, emergency, medical, services, which, was, formed, as, a, hospital, based, service, was, operated, by, the, new, orleans, police, department, from, 1947, to, 1985, and, is, currently, operated, by, the, new, orleans, health, department, and, the, new, orleans, office, of, homeland, security, and, emergency, preparedness, separate, from, the, new, orleans, fire, department, charities, or, non, profit, ambulance, departments, operate, some, emergency, medical, services, they, are, primarily, staffed, by, volunteers, though, many, also, have, paid, personnel, these, may, be, linked, to, a, volunteer, fire, service, and, some, volunteers, may, provide, both, services, some, ambulance, charities, specialize, in, providing, cover, at, public, gatherings, and, events, e, g, sporting, events, while, others, provide, care, to, the, wider, community, the, international, red, cross, and, red, crescent, movement, is, the, largest, charity, in, the, world, that, provides, emergency, medicine, in, some, countries, it, operates, as, a, private, ambulance, service, other, organisations, include, st, john, ambulance, the, order, of, malta, ambulance, corps, and, hatzalah, as, well, as, small, local, volunteer, paid, departments, in, the, united, states, volunteer, ambulances, are, rarer, but, can, still, be, seen, in, both, metropolitan, and, rural, areas, e, g, hatzalah, charities, such, as, basics, scotland, specialise, in, facilitating, training, medical, professionals, to, volunteer, to, assist, the, statutory, ambulance, services, in, the, care, of, patients, through, their, attendance, at, those, with, serious, illnesses, or, injuries, a, few, charities, provide, ambulances, for, taking, patients, on, trips, or, vacations, away, from, hospitals, hospices, or, care, homes, where, they, are, in, long, term, care, examples, include, the, uk, s, jumbulance, project, some, ambulances, are, operated, by, commercial, companies, with, paid, employees, usually, on, a, contract, to, the, local, or, national, government, hospital, networks, health, care, facilities, and, insurance, companies, in, the, u, s, private, ambulance, companies, provide, emergency, medical, services, in, large, cities, and, rural, areas, by, contracting, with, local, governments, in, areas, where, the, local, county, or, city, provide, their, own, emergency, services, private, companies, provide, discharges, and, transfers, from, hospitals, and, to, from, other, health, related, facilities, and, homes, in, most, areas, private, companies, are, part, of, the, local, government, emergency, disaster, plan, and, are, relied, upon, for, the, overall, ems, response, treatment, and, recovery, in, some, areas, private, companies, may, provide, only, the, patient, transport, elements, of, ambulance, care, i, e, non, urgent, but, in, some, places, they, are, contracted, to, provide, emergency, care, or, to, form, a, second, tier, response, where, they, only, respond, to, emergencies, when, all, of, the, full, time, emergency, ambulance, crews, are, busy, this, may, mean, that, a, government, or, other, service, provide, the, emergency, cover, whilst, a, private, firm, may, be, charged, with, minor, injuries, such, as, cuts, bruises, or, even, helping, the, mobility, impaired, if, they, have, for, example, fallen, and, simply, need, help, to, get, up, again, but, do, not, need, treatment, this, system, has, the, benefit, of, keeping, emergency, crews, available, at, all, times, for, genuine, emergencies, these, organisations, may, also, provide, services, known, as, stand, by, cover, at, industrial, sites, or, at, special, events, in, latin, america, private, ambulance, companies, are, often, the, only, readily, available, ems, service, these, are, full, service, emergency, service, agencies, which, may, be, found, in, places, such, as, airports, or, large, colleges, and, universities, like, for, example, the, ucla, ems, their, key, feature, is, that, all, personnel, are, trained, not, only, in, ambulance, emt, care, but, as, a, firefighter, and, a, peace, officer, police, function, they, may, be, found, in, smaller, towns, and, cities, where, demand, or, budget, is, too, low, to, support, separate, services, this, multi, functionality, allows, to, make, the, most, of, limited, resource, or, budget, but, having, a, single, team, respond, to, any, emergency, hospitals, or, larger, hospital, systems, may, provide, their, own, ambulance, service, as, a, service, to, the, community, or, where, ambulance, care, is, unreliable, or, chargeable, many, hospital, based, ems, departments, operate, solely, with, their, hospital, though, some, operate, more, independently, and, can, transport, patients, to, whichever, hospital, may, be, needed, or, desired, many, large, factories, and, other, industrial, centers, such, as, chemical, plants, oil, refineries, breweries, and, distilleries, have, emergency, medical, services, provided, by, employers, as, a, means, of, protecting, their, interests, and, the, welfare, of, their, staff, these, are, often, used, as, first, response, vehicles, in, the, event, of, a, fire, or, explosion, emergency, medical, services, exists, to, fulfill, the, basic, principles, of, first, aid, which, are, to, preserve, life, prevent, further, injury, and, promote, recovery, this, common, theme, in, medicine, is, demonstrated, by, the, star, of, life, the, star, of, life, shown, here, where, each, of, the, arms, to, the, star, represent, one, of, the, six, points, are, used, to, represent, the, six, stages, of, high, quality, pre, hospital, care, which, are, although, a, variety, of, differing, philosophical, approaches, are, used, in, the, provision, of, ems, care, around, the, world, they, can, generally, be, placed, into, one, of, two, categories, one, physician, led, and, the, other, led, by, pre, hospital, allied, health, staff, such, as, emergency, medical, technicians, or, paramedics, these, models, are, commonly, referred, to, as, the, franco, german, model, and, anglo, american, model, studies, have, been, inconclusive, as, to, whether, one, model, delivers, better, results, than, the, other, a, 2010, study, in, the, oman, medical, journal, suggested, that, rapid, transport, was, a, better, strategy, for, trauma, cases, while, stabilization, at, the, scene, was, a, better, strategy, for, cardiac, arrests, many, systems, have, tiers, of, response, for, medical, emergencies, for, example, a, common, arrangement, in, the, united, states, is, that, fire, engines, or, volunteers, are, sent, to, provide, a, rapid, initial, response, to, a, medical, emergency, while, an, ambulance, is, sent, to, provide, advanced, treatment, and, transport, the, patient, in, france, fire, service, and, private, company, ambulances, provide, basic, care, while, hospital, based, ambulances, with, physicians, on, board, provide, advanced, care, in, many, countries, an, air, ambulance, provides, a, higher, level, of, care, than, a, regular, ambulance, examples, of, level, of, care, include, the, most, basic, emergency, medical, services, are, provided, as, a, transport, operation, only, simply, to, take, patients, from, their, location, to, the, nearest, medical, treatment, this, was, historically, the, case, in, all, countries, it, remains, the, case, in, much, of, the, developing, world, where, operators, as, diverse, as, taxi, drivers, and, undertakers, may, transport, people, to, hospital, the, anglo, american, model, is, also, known, as, load, and, go, or, scoop, and, run, in, this, model, ambulances, are, staffed, by, paramedics, and, or, emergency, medical, technicians, they, have, specialized, medical, training, but, not, to, the, same, level, as, a, physician, in, this, model, it, is, rare, to, find, a, physician, actually, working, routinely, in, ambulances, although, they, may, be, deployed, to, major, or, complex, cases, the, physicians, who, work, in, ems, provide, oversight, for, the, work, of, the, ambulance, crews, this, may, include, off, line, medical, control, where, they, devise, protocols, or, standing, orders, procedures, for, treatment, this, may, also, include, on, line, medical, control, in, which, the, physician, is, contacted, via, radio, or, phone, to, provide, advice, and, authorization, for, various, medical, interventions, or, for, a, patient, s, desire, to, refuse, care, in, some, cases, such, as, in, the, uk, south, africa, and, australia, a, paramedic, may, be, an, autonomous, medical, professional, and, does, not, require, the, permission, of, a, physician, to, administer, interventions, or, medications, from, an, agreed, list, and, can, perform, roles, such, as, suturing, or, prescribing, medication, to, the, patient, recently, telemedicine, has, been, making, an, appearance, in, ambulances, similar, to, online, medical, control, this, practice, allows, paramedics, to, remotely, transmit, data, such, as, vital, signs, and, 12, and, 15, lead, ecgs, to, the, hospital, from, the, field, this, allows, the, emergency, department, to, prepare, to, treat, patients, prior, to, their, arrival, this, is, allowing, lower, level, providers, such, as, emt, b, in, the, united, states, to, utilize, these, advanced, technologies, and, have, the, doctor, interpret, them, thus, bringing, rapid, identification, of, rhythms, to, areas, where, paramedics, are, stretched, thin, while, most, insurance, companies, only, reimburse, ems, providers, for, transporting, patients, to, 911, receiving, facilities, e, g, emergency, departments, the, center, to, medicare, and, medicaid, services, is, in, the, process, of, evaluating, a, payment, model, to, enable, reimbursement, for, patients, evaluated, and, treated, on, scene, the, essential, decision, in, prehospital, care, is, whether, the, patient, should, be, immediately, taken, to, the, hospital, or, advanced, care, resources, are, taken, to, the, patient, where, they, lie, the, scoop, and, run, approach, is, exemplified, by, the, medevac, aeromedical, evacuation, helicopter, whereas, the, stay, and, play, is, exemplified, by, the, french, and, belgian, smur, emergency, mobile, resuscitation, unit, or, the, german, notarzt, system, preclinical, emergency, physician, the, strategy, developed, for, prehospital, trauma, care, in, north, america, is, based, on, the, golden, hour, theory, i, e, that, a, trauma, victim, s, best, chance, for, survival, is, in, an, operating, room, with, the, goal, of, having, the, patient, in, surgery, within, an, hour, of, the, traumatic, event, this, appears, to, be, true, in, cases, of, internal, bleeding, especially, penetrating, trauma, such, as, gunshot, or, stab, wounds, thus, minimal, time, is, spent, providing, prehospital, care, spine, immobilization, abcs, i, e, ensure, a, irway, b, reathing, and, c, irculation, external, bleeding, control, endotracheal, intubation, and, the, victim, is, transported, as, fast, as, possible, to, a, trauma, centre, the, aim, in, scoop, and, run, treatment, is, generally, to, transport, the, patient, within, ten, minutes, of, arrival, hence, the, birth, of, the, phrase, the, platinum, ten, minutes, in, addition, to, the, golden, hour, now, commonly, used, in, emt, training, programs, the, scoop, and, run, is, a, method, developed, to, deal, with, trauma, rather, than, strictly, medical, situations, e, g, cardiac, or, respiratory, emergencies, however, this, may, be, changing, increasingly, research, into, the, management, of, s, t, segment, elevation, myocardial, infarctions, stemi, occurring, outside, of, the, hospital, or, even, inside, community, hospitals, without, their, own, pci, labs, suggests, that, time, to, treatment, is, a, clinically, significant, factor, in, heart, attacks, and, that, trauma, patients, may, not, be, the, only, patients, for, whom, load, and, go, is, clinically, appropriate, in, such, conditions, the, gold, standard, is, the, door, to, balloon, time, the, longer, the, time, interval, the, greater, the, damage, to, the, myocardium, and, the, poorer, the, long, term, prognosis, for, the, patient, current, research, in, canada, has, suggested, that, door, to, balloon, times, are, significantly, lower, when, appropriate, patients, are, identified, by, paramedics, in, the, field, instead, of, the, emergency, room, and, then, transported, directly, to, a, waiting, pci, lab, the, stemi, program, has, reduced, stemi, deaths, in, the, ottawa, region, by, 50, per, cent, in, a, related, program, in, toronto, ems, has, begun, to, use, a, procedure, of, rescuing, stemi, patients, from, the, emergency, rooms, of, hospitals, without, pci, labs, and, transporting, them, on, an, emergency, basis, to, waiting, pci, labs, in, other, hospitals, physician, led, ems, is, also, known, as, the, franco, german, model, stay, and, play, stay, and, stabilize, or, delay, and, treat, in, a, physician, led, system, doctors, respond, directly, to, all, major, emergencies, requiring, more, than, simple, first, aid, the, physicians, will, attempt, to, treat, casualties, at, the, scene, and, will, only, transport, them, to, hospital, if, it, is, deemed, necessary, if, patients, are, transported, to, hospital, they, are, more, likely, to, go, straight, to, a, ward, rather, than, to, an, emergency, department, countries, that, use, this, model, include, austria, france, belgium, luxembourg, italy, spain, brazil, and, chile, in, some, cases, in, this, model, such, as, france, there, is, no, direct, equivalent, to, a, paramedic, physicians, and, in, some, cases, nurses, provide, all, medical, interventions, for, the, patient, other, ambulance, personnel, are, not, non, medically, trained, and, only, provide, driving, and, heavy, lifting, in, other, applications, of, this, model, as, in, germany, a, paramedic, equivalent, does, exist, but, is, an, assistant, to, the, physician, with, a, restricted, scope, of, practice, they, are, only, permitted, to, perform, advanced, life, support, als, procedures, if, authorized, by, the, physician, or, in, cases, of, immediate, life, threatening, conditions, ambulances, in, this, model, tend, to, be, better, equipped, with, more, advanced, medical, devices, in, essence, bringing, the, emergency, department, to, the, patient, high, speed, transport, to, hospitals, is, considered, in, most, cases, to, be, unnecessarily, unsafe, and, the, preference, is, to, remain, and, provide, definitive, care, to, the, patient, until, they, are, medically, stable, and, then, accomplish, transport, in, this, model, the, physician, and, nurse, may, actually, staff, an, ambulance, along, with, a, driver, or, may, staff, a, rapid, response, vehicle, instead, of, an, ambulance, providing, medical, support, to, multiple, ambulances, ambulance, personnel, are, generally, professionals, and, in, some, countries, their, use, is, controlled, through, training, and, registration, while, these, job, titles, are, protected, by, legislation, in, some, countries, this, protection, is, by, no, means, universal, and, anyone, might, for, example, call, themselves, an, emt, or, a, paramedic, regardless, of, their, training, or, the, lack, of, it, in, some, jurisdictions, both, technicians, and, paramedics, may, be, further, defined, by, the, environment, in, which, they, operate, including, such, designations, as, wilderness, tactical, and, so, on, a, unique, aspect, of, ems, is, that, there, are, two, hierarchies, of, authority, as, the, chain, of, command, is, separate, to, medical, authority, an, emergency, medical, dispatcher, is, also, called, an, emd, an, increasingly, common, addition, to, the, ems, system, is, the, use, of, highly, trained, dispatch, personnel, who, can, provide, pre, arrival, instructions, to, callers, reporting, medical, emergencies, they, use, carefully, structured, questioning, techniques, and, provide, scripted, instructions, to, allow, callers, or, bystanders, to, begin, definitive, care, for, such, critical, problems, as, airway, obstructions, bleeding, childbirth, and, cardiac, arrest, even, with, a, fast, response, time, by, a, first, responder, measured, in, minutes, some, medical, emergencies, evolve, in, seconds, such, a, system, provides, in, essence, a, zero, response, time, and, can, have, an, enormous, impact, on, positive, patient, outcomes, certified, first, responders, may, be, sent, to, provide, first, aid, sometimes, to, an, advanced, level, their, duties, include, the, provision, of, immediate, life, saving, care, in, the, event, of, a, medical, emergency, commonly, advanced, first, aid, oxygen, administration, cardio, pulmonary, resuscitation, cpr, and, automated, external, defibrillator, aed, usage, the, first, responder, training, is, considered, a, bare, minimum, for, emergency, service, workers, who, may, be, sent, out, in, response, to, an, emergency, call, first, responders, are, commonly, dispatched, by, the, ambulance, service, to, arrive, quickly, and, stabilize, the, patient, before, the, ambulance, arrives, and, to, then, assist, the, ambulance, crew, some, ems, agencies, have, set, up, volunteer, schemes, who, can, be, dispatched, to, a, medical, emergency, before, the, ambulance, arrives, examples, of, this, include, community, first, responder, schemes, run, by, ambulance, services, the, uk, and, similar, volunteer, schemes, operated, by, the, fire, services, in, france, in, some, countries, such, as, the, us, there, may, be, autonomous, groups, of, volunteer, responders, such, as, rescue, squads, police, officers, and, firefighters, who, are, on, duty, for, another, emergency, service, may, also, be, deployed, in, this, role, though, some, firefighters, are, trained, to, a, more, advanced, medical, level, besides, first, responders, who, are, deployed, to, an, emergency, there, are, others, who, may, be, stationed, at, public, events, the, international, red, cross, and, red, crescent, movement, and, st, john, ambulance, both, provide, first, aiders, in, these, roles, some, agencies, separate, the, driver, and, attendant, functions, employing, ambulance, driving, staff, with, no, medical, qualification, or, just, a, first, aid, and, cpr, certificates, whose, job, is, to, drive, ambulances, while, this, approach, persists, in, some, countries, such, as, india, it, is, generally, becoming, increasingly, rare, ambulance, drivers, may, be, trained, in, radio, communications, ambulance, operations, and, emergency, response, driving, skills, many, countries, employ, ambulance, staff, who, only, carry, out, non, emergency, patient, transport, duties, which, can, include, stretcher, or, wheelchair, cases, dependent, on, the, provider, and, resources, available, they, may, be, trained, in, first, aid, or, extended, skills, such, as, use, of, an, aed, oxygen, therapy, pain, relief, and, other, live, saving, or, palliative, skills, in, some, services, they, may, also, provide, emergency, cover, when, other, units, are, not, available, or, when, accompanied, by, a, fully, qualified, technician, or, paramedic, the, role, is, known, as, an, ambulance, care, assistant, in, the, united, kingdom, emergency, care, assistants, are, of, a, frontline, under, both, emergency, and, non, emergency, conditions, to, incidents, their, role, is, to, assist, the, clinician, that, they, are, working, with, either, a, technician, or, paramedic, in, their, duties, whether, that, be, drawing, up, drugs, setting, up, fluids, but, not, attaching, doing, basic, observations, or, performing, 12, lead, ecg, assessments, emergency, medical, technicians, are, usually, able, to, perform, a, wide, range, of, emergency, care, skills, such, as, automated, defibrillation, care, of, spinal, injuries, and, oxygen, therapy, in, few, jurisdictions, some, emts, are, able, to, perform, duties, as, iv, and, io, cannulation, administration, of, a, limited, number, of, drugs, including, but, not, limited, to, epinephrine, narcan, oxygen, aspirin, nitroglycerin, dependent, on, country, state, and, medical, direction, more, advanced, airway, procedures, cpap, and, limited, cardiac, monitoring, most, advanced, procedures, and, skills, are, not, within, the, national, scope, of, practice, for, an, emt, as, such, most, states, require, additional, training, and, certifications, to, perform, above, the, national, curriculum, standards, in, the, united, states, an, emt, certification, requires, intense, courses, and, training, in, field, skills, a, certification, expires, after, two, years, and, holds, a, requirement, of, taking, 48, ceus, continuing, education, credits, 24, of, these, credits, must, be, in, refresher, courses, while, the, other, 24, can, be, taken, in, a, variety, ways, such, as, emergency, driving, training, pediatric, geriatric, or, bariatric, care, specific, traumas, etc, is, usually, made, up, of, 3, levels, in, the, us, emt, b, emt, i, emt, a, in, some, states, and, emt, paramedic, the, national, registry, of, emt, new, educational, standards, for, ems, renamed, the, provider, levels, as, follows, emergency, medical, responder, emr, emergency, medical, technician, emt, b, advanced, emt, aemt, and, paramedic, emt, p, a, paramedic, has, a, high, level, of, pre, hospital, medical, training, and, usually, involves, key, skills, not, performed, by, technicians, often, including, cannulation, and, with, it, the, ability, to, use, a, range, of, drugs, to, relieve, pain, correct, cardiac, problems, and, perform, endotracheal, intubation, cardiac, monitoring, 12, lead, ecg, interpretation, ultrasound, intubation, pericardiocentesis, cardioversion, thoracostomy, and, other, skills, such, as, performing, a, surgical, cricothyrotomy, the, most, important, function, of, the, paramedic, is, to, identify, and, treat, any, life, threatening, conditions, and, then, to, assess, the, patient, carefully, for, other, complaints, or, findings, that, may, require, emergency, treatment, in, many, countries, this, is, a, protected, title, and, use, of, it, without, the, relevant, qualification, may, result, in, criminal, prosecution, in, the, united, states, paramedics, represent, the, highest, licensure, level, of, prehospital, emergency, care, in, addition, several, certifications, exist, for, paramedics, such, as, wilderness, als, care, flight, paramedic, certification, fp, c, and, critical, care, emergency, medical, transport, program, certification, a, critical, care, paramedic, also, known, as, an, advanced, practice, paramedic, or, specialist, paramedic, is, a, paramedic, with, additional, training, to, deal, with, critically, ill, patients, critical, care, paramedics, often, work, on, air, ambulances, which, are, more, likely, to, be, dispatched, to, emergencies, requiring, advanced, care, skills, they, may, also, work, on, land, ambulances, the, training, permitted, skills, and, certification, requirements, vary, from, one, jurisdiction, to, the, next, it, also, varies, to, whether, they, are, trained, externally, by, a, university, or, professional, body, or, in, house, by, their, ems, agency, these, providers, have, a, vast, array, of, and, medications, to, handle, complex, medical, and, trauma, patients, examples, of, medication, are, dobutamine, dopamine, propofol, blood, and, blood, products, to, name, just, a, few, some, examples, of, skills, include, but, not, limited, to, life, support, systems, normally, restricted, to, the, icu, or, critical, care, hospital, setting, such, as, mechanical, ventilators, intra, aortic, balloon, pump, iabp, and, external, pacemaker, monitoring, depending, on, the, service, medical, direction, these, providers, are, trained, on, placement, and, use, of, uvcs, umbilical, venous, catheter, uacs, umbilical, arterial, catheter, surgical, airways, central, lines, arterial, lines, and, chest, tubes, in, the, united, kingdom, and, south, africa, some, serving, paramedics, receive, additional, university, education, to, become, practitioners, in, their, own, right, which, gives, them, absolute, responsibility, for, their, clinical, judgement, including, the, ability, to, autonomously, prescribe, medications, an, emergency, care, practitioner, or, paramedic, practitioner, is, a, position, that, is, designed, to, bridge, the, link, between, ambulance, care, and, the, care, of, a, general, practitioner, ecps, are, university, graduates, in, emergency, medical, care, or, qualified, paramedics, who, have, undergone, further, training, and, are, authorized, to, perform, specialized, techniques, additionally, some, may, prescribe, medicines, for, longer, term, care, such, as, antibiotics, and, in, the, united, kingdom, they, can, prescribe, a, broad, range, of, medicines, with, respect, to, a, primary, health, care, setting, they, are, also, educated, in, a, range, of, diagnostic, techniques, the, use, of, registered, nurses, rns, in, the, pre, hospital, setting, is, common, in, many, countries, in, absence, of, paramedics, in, some, regions, of, the, world, nurses, are, the, primary, healthcare, worker, that, provides, emergency, medical, services, in, european, countries, such, as, france, or, italy, also, use, nurses, as, a, means, of, providing, als, services, these, nurses, may, work, under, the, direct, supervision, of, a, physician, or, in, rarer, cases, independently, in, some, places, in, europe, notably, norway, paramedics, do, exist, but, the, role, of, the, ambulance, nurse, continues, to, be, developed, as, it, is, felt, that, nurses, may, bring, unique, skills, to, some, situations, encountered, by, ambulance, crews, in, north, america, and, to, a, lesser, extent, elsewhere, in, the, english, speaking, world, some, jurisdictions, use, specially, trained, nurses, for, medical, transport, work, these, are, mostly, air, medical, personnel, or, critical, care, transport, providers, often, working, in, conjunction, with, a, technician, paramedic, or, physician, on, emergency, interfacility, transports, in, the, united, states, the, most, common, uses, of, ambulance, based, registered, nurses, is, in, the, critical, care, mobile, intensive, care, transport, and, in, aeromedical, ems, such, nurses, are, normally, required, by, their, employers, in, the, us, to, seek, additional, certifications, beyond, the, primary, nursing, licensure, four, individual, states, have, an, intensive, care, or, prehospital, nurse, licensure, many, states, allow, registered, nurses, to, also, become, registered, paramedics, according, to, their, role, in, the, emergency, medical, services, team, in, estonia, 60, of, ambulance, teams, are, led, by, nurse, ambulance, nurses, can, do, almost, all, emergency, procedures, and, administer, medicines, pre, hospital, such, as, physicians, in, estonia, in, the, netherlands, all, ambulances, are, staffed, by, a, registered, nurse, with, additional, training, in, emergency, nursing, anaesthesia, or, critical, care, and, a, driver, emt, in, sweden, since, 2005, all, emergency, ambulances, should, be, staffed, by, at, least, one, registered, nurse, since, only, nurses, are, allowed, to, administer, drugs, and, all, advanced, life, support, ambulances, are, staffed, at, least, by, a, registered, nurse, in, spain, in, france, since, 1986, fire, department, based, rescue, ambulances, have, had, the, option, of, providing, resuscitation, service, reanimation, using, specially, trained, nurses, operating, on, protocols, while, samu, smur, units, are, staffed, by, physicians, and, nurses, in, countries, with, a, physician, led, ems, model, such, as, france, italy, the, german, speaking, countries, germany, switzerland, austria, and, spain, physicians, respond, to, all, cases, that, require, more, than, basic, first, aid, in, some, versions, of, this, model, such, as, france, italy, and, spain, there, is, no, direct, equivalent, to, a, paramedic, as, als, is, performed, by, physicians, in, the, german, speaking, countries, paramedics, are, assistants, to, ambulance, physicians, called, notarzt, in, these, countries, if, a, physician, is, present, paramedics, require, permission, from, the, physician, to, administer, treatments, such, as, defibrillation, and, drugs, if, there, is, no, physician, on, scene, and, a, life, threatening, condition, is, present, they, may, administer, treatments, that, follow, the, physician, s, instructions, in, countries, where, ems, is, led, by, paramedics, the, ambulance, service, may, still, employ, physicians, they, may, serve, on, specialist, response, vehicles, such, as, the, air, ambulances, in, the, uk, they, may, also, provide, advice, and, devise, protocols, for, treatment, with, a, medical, director, acting, as, the, most, senior, medical, adviser, to, the, ambulance, service, in, the, united, states, ems, became, an, officially, recognized, subspecialty, by, the, american, board, of, emergency, medicine, in, 2010, and, the, first, examinations, were, held, in, 2013, many, states, now, recommend, ems, board, certifiction, for, newly, hired, medical, directors, of, ems, agencies, air, ambulances, also, known, as, medevac, often, complement, a, land, ambulance, service, in, some, remote, areas, they, may, even, form, the, primary, ambulance, service, like, many, innovations, in, ems, medical, aircraft, were, first, used, in, the, military, one, of, the, first, recorded, aircraft, rescues, of, a, casualty, was, in, 1917, in, turkey, when, a, soldier, in, the, camel, corps, who, had, been, shot, in, the, ankle, was, flown, to, hospital, in, a, de, havilland, dh9, in, 1928, the, first, civilian, air, medical, service, was, founded, in, australia, to, provide, healthcare, to, people, living, in, remote, parts, of, the, outback, this, service, became, the, royal, flying, doctor, service, the, use, of, helicopters, was, pioneered, in, the, korean, war, when, time, to, reach, a, medical, facility, was, reduced, from, 8, hours, to, 3, hours, in, world, war, ii, and, again, to, 2, hours, by, the, vietnam, war, aircraft, can, travel, faster, and, operate, in, a, wider, coverage, area, than, a, land, ambulance, they, have, a, particular, advantage, for, major, trauma, injuries, especially, when, they, occur, in, rural, or, isolated, areas, the, well, established, theory, of, the, golden, hour, suggests, that, major, trauma, patients, should, be, transported, as, quickly, as, possible, to, a, specialist, trauma, center, therefore, medical, first, responders, in, a, helicopter, can, provide, both, a, higher, level, of, care, at, the, scene, faster, transport, to, a, specialist, hospital, and, critical, care, during, the, journey, a, disadvantage, is, that, it, can, be, dangerous, and, potentially, not, possible, for, them, to, fly, at, night, or, in, bad, weather, some, ems, agencies, have, set, up, specialist, teams, to, help, those, injured, in, a, major, incident, or, a, dangerous, situation, these, include, tactical, police, operations, active, shooters, bombings, hazmat, situations, building, collapses, fires, and, natural, disasters, in, the, us, these, are, often, known, as, tactical, ems, teams, and, are, often, deployed, alongside, police, swat, teams, the, equivalent, in, uk, ambulance, services, is, a, hazardous, area, response, team, hart, wilderness, ems, like, systems, wems, have, been, developed, to, provide, medical, responses, in, remote, areas, which, may, have, significantly, different, needs, to, an, urban, area, examples, include, the, national, ski, patrol, or, the, regional, responding, appalachian, search, and, rescue, conference, usa, based, like, traditional, ems, providers, all, wilderness, emergency, medical, wem, providers, must, still, operate, under, on, line, or, off, line, medical, oversight, to, assist, physicians, in, the, skills, necessary, to, provide, this, oversight, the, wilderness, medical, society, and, the, national, association, of, ems, physicians, jointly, supported, the, development, in, 2011, of, a, unique, wilderness, ems, medical, director, certification, course, which, was, cited, by, the, journal, of, ems, as, one, of, the, top, 10, ems, innovations, of, 2011, skills, taught, in, wemt, courses, exceeding, the, emt, basic, scope, of, practice, include, catheterization, antibiotic, administration, use, of, intermediate, blind, insertion, airway, devices, i, e, king, laryngeal, tube, nasogastric, intubation, and, simple, suturing, however, the, scope, of, practice, for, the, wemt, still, falls, under, bls, level, care, a, multitude, of, organizations, provide, wem, training, including, private, schools, non, profit, organizations, such, as, the, appalachian, center, for, wilderness, medicine, and, the, wilderness, ems, institute, military, branches, community, colleges, and, universities, ems, college, hospital, collaborations, and, others
