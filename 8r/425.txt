a, dragonfly, is, a, flying, insect, belonging, to, the, infraorder, anisoptera, below, the, order, odonata, about, 3, 000, extant, species, of, dragonflies, are, known, most, are, tropical, with, fewer, species, in, temperate, regions, loss, of, wetland, habitat, threatens, dragonfly, populations, around, the, world, adult, dragonflies, are, characterised, by, a, pair, of, large, multifaceted, compound, eyes, two, pairs, of, strong, transparent, wings, sometimes, with, coloured, patches, and, an, elongated, body, many, dragonflies, have, brilliant, iridescent, or, metallic, colours, produced, by, structural, coloration, making, them, conspicuous, in, flight, an, adult, dragonfly, s, compound, eyes, have, nearly, 24, 000, ommatidia, each, dragonflies, can, be, mistaken, for, the, closely, related, damselflies, which, make, up, the, other, odonatan, infraorder, zygoptera, and, are, similar, in, body, plan, though, usually, lighter, in, build, however, the, wings, of, most, dragonflies, are, held, flat, and, away, from, the, body, while, damselflies, hold, their, wings, folded, at, rest, along, or, above, the, abdomen, dragonflies, are, agile, fliers, while, damselflies, have, a, weaker, fluttery, flight, dragonflies, make, use, of, motion, camouflage, when, attacking, prey, or, rivals, dragonflies, are, predatory, insects, both, in, their, aquatic, nymphal, stage, also, known, as, naiads, and, as, adults, in, some, species, the, nymphal, stage, lasts, up, to, five, years, and, the, adult, stage, may, be, as, long, as, 10, weeks, but, most, species, have, an, adult, lifespan, in, the, order, of, five, weeks, or, less, and, some, survive, for, only, a, few, days, they, are, fast, agile, fliers, capable, of, highly, accurate, aerial, ambush, sometimes, migrating, across, oceans, and, often, live, near, water, they, have, a, uniquely, complex, mode, of, reproduction, involving, indirect, insemination, delayed, fertilisation, and, sperm, competition, during, mating, the, male, grasps, the, female, at, the, back, of, the, head, and, the, female, curls, her, abdomen, under, her, body, to, pick, up, sperm, from, the, male, s, secondary, genitalia, at, the, front, of, his, abdomen, forming, the, heart, or, wheel, posture, fossils, of, very, large, dragonfly, like, insects, sometimes, called, griffinflies, are, found, from, 325, million, years, ago, mya, in, upper, carboniferous, rocks, these, had, wingspans, up, to, about, 750, mm, 30, in, though, they, were, only, distant, relatives, not, true, dragonflies, which, first, appeared, during, the, early, jurassic, dragonflies, are, represented, in, human, culture, on, artefacts, such, as, pottery, rock, paintings, statues, and, art, nouveau, jewellery, they, are, used, in, traditional, medicine, in, japan, and, china, and, caught, for, food, in, indonesia, they, are, symbols, of, courage, strength, and, happiness, in, japan, but, seen, as, sinister, in, european, folklore, their, bright, colours, and, agile, flight, are, admired, in, the, poetry, of, lord, tennyson, and, the, prose, of, h, e, bates, the, infraorder, anisoptera, comes, from, greek, anisos, unequal, and, pteron, wing, because, dragonflies, hindwings, are, broader, than, their, forewings, dragonflies, and, their, relatives, are, similar, in, structure, to, an, ancient, group, the, meganisoptera, or, griffinflies, from, the, 325, mya, upper, carboniferous, of, europe, a, group, that, included, one, of, the, largest, insects, that, ever, lived, meganeuropsis, permiana, from, the, early, permian, with, a, wingspan, around, 750, mm, 30, in, the, protanisoptera, another, ancestral, group, that, lacks, certain, wing, vein, characters, found, in, modern, odonata, lived, in, the, permian, anisoptera, first, appeared, during, the, toarcian, age, of, the, early, jurassic, and, the, crown, group, developed, in, the, middle, jurassic, they, retain, some, traits, of, their, distant, predecessors, and, are, in, a, group, known, as, the, palaeoptera, meaning, ancient, winged, like, the, gigantic, griffinflies, dragonflies, lack, the, ability, to, fold, their, wings, up, against, their, bodies, in, the, way, modern, insects, do, although, some, evolved, their, own, different, way, to, do, so, the, forerunners, of, modern, odonata, are, included, in, a, clade, called, the, panodonata, which, include, the, basal, zygoptera, damselflies, and, the, anisoptera, true, dragonflies, today, some, 3, 000, species, are, extant, around, the, world, the, relationships, of, anisopteran, families, are, not, fully, resolved, as, of, 2021, but, all, the, families, are, monophyletic, except, the, corduliidae, and, the, austropetaliidae, are, sister, to, the, aeshnoidea, austropetaliidae, aeshnoidea, hawkers, petaluridae, petaltails, gomphidae, clubtails, neopetaliidae, cordulegastridae, goldenrings, chlorogomphidae, synthemistidae, tigertails, many, synthemistidae, genera, incertae, sedis, macromiidae, cruisers, corduliidae, emeralds, libellulidae, skimmers, about, 3, 012, species, of, dragonflies, were, known, in, 2010, these, are, classified, into, 348, genera, in, 11, families, the, distribution, of, diversity, within, the, biogeographical, regions, are, summarized, below, the, world, numbers, are, not, ordinary, totals, as, overlaps, in, species, occur, dragonflies, live, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, in, contrast, to, the, damselflies, zygoptera, which, tend, to, have, restricted, distributions, some, genera, and, species, are, spread, across, continents, for, example, the, blue, eyed, darner, rhionaeschna, multicolor, lives, all, across, north, america, and, in, central, america, emperors, anax, live, throughout, the, americas, from, as, far, north, as, newfoundland, to, as, far, south, as, bahia, blanca, in, argentina, across, europe, to, central, asia, north, africa, and, the, middle, east, the, globe, skimmer, pantala, flavescens, is, probably, the, most, widespread, dragonfly, species, in, the, world, it, is, cosmopolitan, occurring, on, all, continents, in, the, warmer, regions, most, anisoptera, species, are, tropical, with, far, fewer, species, in, temperate, regions, some, dragonflies, including, libellulids, and, aeshnids, live, in, desert, pools, for, example, in, the, mojave, desert, where, they, are, active, in, shade, temperatures, between, 18, and, 45, c, 64, and, 113, f, these, insects, were, able, to, survive, body, temperatures, above, the, thermal, death, point, of, insects, of, the, same, species, in, cooler, places, dragonflies, live, from, sea, level, up, to, the, mountains, decreasing, in, species, diversity, with, altitude, their, altitudinal, limit, is, about, 3700, m, represented, by, a, species, of, aeshna, in, the, pamirs, dragonflies, become, scarce, at, higher, latitudes, they, are, not, native, to, iceland, but, individuals, are, occasionally, swept, in, by, strong, winds, including, a, hemianax, ephippiger, native, to, north, africa, and, an, unidentified, darter, species, in, kamchatka, only, a, few, species, of, dragonfly, including, the, treeline, emerald, somatochlora, arctica, and, some, aeshnids, such, as, aeshna, subarctica, are, found, possibly, because, of, the, low, temperature, of, the, lakes, there, the, treeline, emerald, also, lives, in, northern, alaska, within, the, arctic, circle, making, it, the, most, northerly, of, all, dragonflies, dragonflies, suborder, anisoptera, are, heavy, bodied, strong, flying, insects, that, hold, their, wings, horizontally, both, in, flight, and, at, rest, by, contrast, damselflies, suborder, zygoptera, have, slender, bodies, and, fly, more, weakly, most, species, fold, their, wings, over, the, abdomen, when, stationary, and, the, eyes, are, well, separated, on, the, sides, of, the, head, an, adult, dragonfly, has, three, distinct, segments, the, head, thorax, and, abdomen, as, in, all, insects, it, has, a, chitinous, exoskeleton, of, hard, plates, held, together, with, flexible, membranes, the, head, is, large, with, very, short, antennae, it, is, dominated, by, the, two, compound, eyes, which, cover, most, of, its, surface, the, compound, eyes, are, made, up, of, ommatidia, the, numbers, being, greater, in, the, larger, species, aeshna, interrupta, has, 22650, ommatidia, of, two, varying, sizes, 4500, being, large, the, facets, facing, downward, tend, to, be, smaller, petalura, gigantea, has, 23890, ommatidia, of, just, one, size, these, facets, provide, complete, vision, in, the, frontal, hemisphere, of, the, dragonfly, the, compound, eyes, meet, at, the, top, of, the, head, except, in, the, petaluridae, and, gomphidae, as, also, in, the, genus, epiophlebia, also, they, have, three, simple, eyes, or, ocelli, the, mouthparts, are, adapted, for, biting, with, a, toothed, jaw, the, flap, like, labrum, at, the, front, of, the, mouth, can, be, shot, rapidly, forward, to, catch, prey, the, head, has, a, system, for, locking, it, in, place, that, consists, of, muscles, and, small, hairs, on, the, back, of, the, head, that, grip, structures, on, the, front, of, the, first, thoracic, segment, this, arrester, system, is, unique, to, the, odonata, and, is, activated, when, feeding, and, during, tandem, flight, the, thorax, consists, of, three, segments, as, in, all, insects, the, prothorax, is, small, and, flattened, dorsally, into, a, shield, like, disc, which, has, two, transverse, ridges, the, mesothorax, and, metathorax, are, fused, into, a, rigid, box, like, structure, with, internal, bracing, and, provide, a, robust, attachment, for, the, powerful, wing, muscles, inside, the, thorax, bears, two, pairs, of, wings, and, three, pairs, of, legs, the, wings, are, long, veined, and, membranous, narrower, at, the, tip, and, wider, at, the, base, the, hindwings, are, broader, than, the, forewings, and, the, venation, is, different, at, the, base, the, veins, carry, haemolymph, which, is, analogous, to, blood, in, vertebrates, and, carries, out, many, similar, functions, but, which, also, serves, a, hydraulic, function, to, expand, the, body, between, nymphal, stages, instars, and, to, expand, and, stiffen, the, wings, after, the, adult, emerges, from, the, final, nymphal, stage, the, leading, edge, of, each, wing, has, a, node, where, other, veins, join, the, marginal, vein, and, the, wing, is, able, to, flex, at, this, point, in, most, large, species, of, dragonflies, the, wings, of, females, are, shorter, and, broader, than, those, of, males, the, legs, are, rarely, used, for, walking, but, are, used, to, catch, and, hold, prey, for, perching, and, for, climbing, on, plants, each, has, two, short, basal, joints, two, long, joints, and, a, three, jointed, foot, armed, with, a, pair, of, claws, the, long, leg, joints, bear, rows, of, spines, and, in, males, one, row, of, spines, on, each, front, leg, is, modified, to, form, an, eyebrush, for, cleaning, the, surface, of, the, compound, eye, the, abdomen, is, long, and, slender, and, consists, of, 10, segments, three, terminal, appendages, are, on, segment, 10, a, pair, of, superiors, claspers, and, an, inferior, the, second, and, third, segments, are, enlarged, and, in, males, the, underside, of, the, second, segment, has, a, cleft, forming, the, secondary, genitalia, consisting, of, the, lamina, hamule, genital, lobe, and, penis, there, are, remarkable, variations, in, the, presence, and, the, form, of, the, penis, and, the, related, structures, the, flagellum, cornua, and, genital, lobes, sperm, is, produced, at, the, 9th, segment, and, is, transferred, to, the, secondary, genitalia, prior, to, mating, the, male, holds, the, female, behind, the, head, using, a, pair, of, claspers, on, the, terminal, segment, in, females, the, genital, opening, is, on, the, underside, of, the, eighth, segment, and, is, covered, by, a, simple, flap, vulvar, lamina, or, an, ovipositor, depending, on, species, and, the, method, of, egg, laying, dragonflies, having, simple, flaps, shed, the, eggs, in, water, mostly, in, flight, dragonflies, having, ovipositors, use, them, to, puncture, soft, tissues, of, plants, and, place, the, eggs, singly, in, each, puncture, they, make, dragonfly, nymphs, vary, in, form, with, species, and, are, loosely, classed, into, claspers, sprawlers, hiders, and, burrowers, the, first, instar, is, known, as, a, prolarva, a, relatively, inactive, stage, from, which, it, quickly, moults, into, the, more, active, nymphal, form, the, general, body, plan, is, similar, to, that, of, an, adult, but, the, nymph, lacks, wings, and, reproductive, organs, the, lower, jaw, has, a, huge, extensible, labium, armed, with, hooks, and, spines, which, is, used, for, catching, prey, this, labium, is, folded, under, the, body, at, rest, and, struck, out, at, great, speed, by, hydraulic, pressure, created, by, the, abdominal, muscles, both, damselfly, and, dragonfly, nymphs, ventilate, the, rectum, but, just, some, damselfly, nymphs, have, a, rectal, epithelium, that, is, rich, in, trachea, relying, mostly, on, three, feathery, external, gills, as, their, major, source, of, respiration, only, dragonfly, nymphs, have, internal, gills, called, a, branchial, chamber, located, around, the, fourth, and, fifth, abdominal, segments, these, internal, gills, consist, originally, of, six, longitudinal, folds, each, side, supported, by, cross, folds, but, this, system, has, been, modified, in, several, families, water, is, pumped, in, and, out, of, the, abdomen, through, an, opening, at, the, tip, the, naiads, of, some, clubtails, gomphidae, that, burrow, into, the, sediment, have, a, snorkel, like, tube, at, the, end, of, the, abdomen, enabling, them, to, draw, in, clean, water, while, they, are, buried, in, mud, naiads, can, forcefully, expel, a, jet, of, water, to, propel, themselves, with, great, rapidity, many, adult, dragonflies, have, brilliant, iridescent, or, metallic, colours, produced, by, structural, colouration, making, them, conspicuous, in, flight, their, overall, coloration, is, often, a, combination, of, yellow, red, brown, and, black, pigments, with, structural, colours, blues, are, typically, created, by, microstructures, in, the, cuticle, that, reflect, blue, light, greens, often, combine, a, structural, blue, with, a, yellow, pigment, freshly, emerged, adults, known, as, tenerals, are, often, pale, and, obtain, their, typical, colours, after, a, few, days, some, have, their, bodies, covered, with, a, pale, blue, waxy, powderiness, called, pruinosity, it, wears, off, when, scraped, during, mating, leaving, darker, areas, some, dragonflies, such, as, the, green, darner, anax, junius, have, a, noniridescent, blue, that, is, produced, structurally, by, scatter, from, arrays, of, tiny, spheres, in, the, endoplasmic, reticulum, of, epidermal, cells, underneath, the, cuticle, the, wings, of, dragonflies, are, generally, clear, apart, from, the, dark, veins, and, pterostigmata, in, the, chasers, libellulidae, however, many, genera, have, areas, of, colour, on, the, wings, for, example, groundlings, brachythemis, have, brown, bands, on, all, four, wings, while, some, scarlets, crocothemis, and, dropwings, trithemis, have, bright, orange, patches, at, the, wing, bases, some, aeshnids, such, as, the, brown, hawker, aeshna, grandis, have, translucent, pale, yellow, wings, dragonfly, nymphs, are, usually, a, well, camouflaged, blend, of, dull, brown, green, and, grey, dragonflies, and, damselflies, are, predatory, both, in, the, aquatic, nymphal, and, adult, stages, nymphs, feed, on, a, range, of, freshwater, invertebrates, and, larger, ones, can, prey, on, tadpoles, and, small, fish, one, species, gomphus, militaris, even, live, as, a, parasite, feeding, on, the, gills, of, gravid, mussels, adults, capture, insect, prey, in, the, air, making, use, of, their, acute, vision, and, highly, controlled, flight, the, mating, system, of, dragonflies, is, complex, and, they, are, among, the, few, insect, groups, that, have, a, system, of, indirect, sperm, transfer, along, with, sperm, storage, delayed, fertilisation, and, sperm, competition, adult, males, vigorously, defend, territories, near, water, these, areas, provide, suitable, habitat, for, the, nymphs, to, develop, and, for, females, to, lay, their, eggs, swarms, of, feeding, adults, aggregate, to, prey, on, swarming, prey, such, as, emerging, flying, ants, or, termites, dragonflies, as, a, group, occupy, a, considerable, variety, of, habitats, but, many, species, and, some, families, have, their, own, specific, environmental, requirements, some, species, prefer, flowing, waters, while, others, prefer, standing, water, for, example, the, gomphidae, clubtails, live, in, running, water, and, the, libellulidae, skimmers, live, in, still, water, some, species, live, in, temporary, water, pools, and, are, capable, of, tolerating, changes, in, water, level, desiccation, and, the, resulting, variations, in, temperature, but, some, genera, such, as, sympetrum, darters, have, eggs, and, nymphs, that, can, resist, drought, and, are, stimulated, to, grow, rapidly, in, warm, shallow, pools, also, often, benefiting, from, the, absence, of, predators, there, vegetation, and, its, characteristics, including, submerged, floating, emergent, or, waterside, are, also, important, adults, may, require, emergent, or, waterside, plants, to, use, as, perches, others, may, need, specific, submerged, or, floating, plants, on, which, to, lay, eggs, requirements, may, be, highly, specific, as, in, aeshna, viridis, green, hawker, which, lives, in, swamps, with, the, water, soldier, stratiotes, aloides, the, chemistry, of, the, water, including, its, trophic, status, degree, of, enrichment, with, nutrients, and, ph, can, also, affect, its, use, by, dragonflies, most, species, need, moderate, conditions, not, too, eutrophic, not, too, acidic, a, few, species, such, as, sympetrum, danae, black, darter, and, libellula, quadrimaculata, four, spotted, chaser, prefer, acidic, waters, such, as, peat, bogs, while, others, such, as, libellula, fulva, scarce, chaser, need, slow, moving, eutrophic, waters, with, reeds, or, similar, waterside, plants, many, dragonflies, particularly, males, are, territorial, some, defend, a, territory, against, others, of, their, own, species, some, against, other, species, of, dragonfly, and, a, few, against, insects, in, unrelated, groups, a, particular, perch, may, give, a, dragonfly, a, good, view, over, an, insect, rich, feeding, ground, males, of, many, species, such, as, the, pachydiplax, longipennis, blue, dasher, jostle, other, dragonflies, to, maintain, the, right, to, alight, there, defending, a, breeding, territory, is, common, among, male, dragonflies, especially, in, species, that, congregate, around, ponds, the, territory, contains, desirable, features, such, as, a, sunlit, stretch, of, shallow, water, a, special, plant, species, or, the, preferred, substrate, for, egg, laying, the, territory, may, be, small, or, large, depending, on, its, quality, the, time, of, day, and, the, number, of, competitors, and, may, be, held, for, a, few, minutes, or, several, hours, dragonflies, including, tramea, lacerata, black, saddlebags, may, notice, landmarks, that, assist, in, defining, the, boundaries, of, the, territory, landmarks, may, reduce, the, costs, of, territory, establishment, or, might, serve, as, a, spatial, reference, some, dragonflies, signal, ownership, with, striking, colours, on, the, face, abdomen, legs, or, wings, the, plathemis, lydia, common, whitetail, dashes, towards, an, intruder, holding, its, white, abdomen, aloft, like, a, flag, other, dragonflies, engage, in, aerial, dogfights, or, high, speed, chases, a, female, must, mate, with, the, territory, holder, before, laying, her, eggs, there, is, also, conflict, between, the, males, and, females, females, may, sometimes, be, harassed, by, males, to, the, extent, that, it, affects, their, normal, activities, including, foraging, and, in, some, dimorphic, species, females, have, evolved, multiple, forms, with, some, forms, appearing, deceptively, like, males, in, some, species, females, have, evolved, behavioural, responses, such, as, feigning, death, to, escape, the, attention, of, males, similarly, selection, of, habitat, by, adult, dragonflies, is, not, random, and, terrestrial, habitat, patches, may, be, held, for, up, to, 3, months, a, species, tightly, linked, to, its, birth, site, utilises, a, foraging, area, that, is, several, orders, of, magnitude, larger, than, the, birth, site, mating, in, dragonflies, is, a, complex, precisely, choreographed, process, first, the, male, has, to, attract, a, female, to, his, territory, continually, driving, off, rival, males, when, he, is, ready, to, mate, he, transfers, a, packet, of, sperm, from, his, primary, genital, opening, on, segment, 9, near, the, end, of, his, abdomen, to, his, secondary, genitalia, on, segments, 2, 3, near, the, base, of, his, abdomen, the, male, then, grasps, the, female, by, the, head, with, the, claspers, at, the, end, of, his, abdomen, the, structure, of, the, claspers, varies, between, species, and, may, help, to, prevent, interspecific, mating, the, pair, flies, in, tandem, with, the, male, in, front, typically, perching, on, a, twig, or, plant, stem, the, female, then, curls, her, abdomen, downwards, and, forwards, under, her, body, to, pick, up, the, sperm, from, the, male, s, secondary, genitalia, while, the, male, uses, his, tail, claspers, to, grip, the, female, behind, the, head, this, distinctive, posture, is, called, the, heart, or, wheel, the, pair, may, also, be, described, as, being, in, cop, egg, laying, ovipositing, involves, not, only, the, female, darting, over, floating, or, waterside, vegetation, to, deposit, eggs, on, a, suitable, substrate, but, also, the, male, hovering, above, her, or, continuing, to, clasp, her, and, flying, in, tandem, this, behaviour, following, the, transfer, of, sperm, is, termed, as, mate, guarding, and, the, guarding, male, attempts, to, increase, the, probability, of, his, sperm, fertilising, eggs, sexual, selection, with, sperm, competition, occurs, within, the, spermatheca, of, the, female, and, sperm, can, remain, viable, for, at, least, 12, days, in, some, species, females, can, fertilise, their, eggs, using, sperm, from, the, spermatheca, at, any, time, males, use, their, penis, and, associated, genital, structures, to, compress, or, scrape, out, sperm, from, previous, matings, this, activity, takes, up, much, of, the, time, that, a, copulating, pair, remains, in, the, heart, posture, flying, in, tandem, has, the, advantage, that, less, effort, is, needed, by, the, female, for, flight, and, more, can, be, expended, on, egg, laying, and, when, the, female, submerges, to, deposit, eggs, the, male, may, help, to, pull, her, out, of, the, water, egg, laying, takes, two, different, forms, depending, on, the, species, the, female, in, some, families, aeshnidae, petaluridae, has, a, sharp, edged, ovipositor, with, which, she, slits, open, a, stem, or, leaf, of, a, plant, on, or, near, the, water, so, she, can, push, her, eggs, inside, in, other, families, such, as, clubtails, gomphidae, cruisers, macromiidae, emeralds, corduliidae, and, skimmers, libellulidae, the, female, lays, eggs, by, tapping, the, surface, of, the, water, repeatedly, with, her, abdomen, by, shaking, the, eggs, out, of, her, abdomen, as, she, flies, along, or, by, placing, the, eggs, on, vegetation, in, a, few, species, the, eggs, are, laid, on, emergent, plants, above, the, water, and, development, is, delayed, until, these, have, withered, and, become, immersed, dragonflies, are, hemimetabolous, insects, they, do, not, have, a, pupal, stage, and, undergo, an, incomplete, metamorphosis, with, a, series, of, nymphal, stages, from, which, the, adult, emerges, eggs, laid, inside, plant, tissues, are, usually, shaped, like, grains, of, rice, while, other, eggs, are, the, size, of, a, pinhead, ellipsoidal, or, nearly, spherical, a, clutch, may, have, as, many, as, 1500, eggs, and, they, take, about, a, week, to, hatch, into, aquatic, nymphs, or, naiads, which, moult, between, six, and, 15, times, depending, on, species, as, they, grow, most, of, a, dragonfly, s, life, is, spent, as, a, nymph, beneath, the, water, s, surface, the, nymph, extends, its, hinged, labium, a, toothed, mouthpart, similar, to, a, lower, mandible, which, is, sometimes, termed, as, a, mask, as, it, is, normally, folded, and, held, before, the, face, that, can, extend, forward, and, retract, rapidly, to, capture, prey, such, as, mosquito, larvae, tadpoles, and, small, fish, they, breathe, through, gills, in, their, rectum, and, can, rapidly, propel, themselves, by, suddenly, expelling, water, through, the, anus, some, naiads, such, as, the, later, stages, of, antipodophlebia, asthenes, hunt, on, land, the, nymph, stage, of, dragonflies, lasts, up, to, five, years, in, large, species, and, between, two, months, and, three, years, in, smaller, species, when, the, naiad, is, ready, to, metamorphose, into, an, adult, it, stops, feeding, and, makes, its, way, to, the, surface, generally, at, night, it, remains, stationary, with, its, head, out, of, the, water, while, its, respiration, system, adapts, to, breathing, air, then, climbs, up, a, reed, or, other, emergent, plant, and, moults, ecdysis, anchoring, itself, firmly, in, a, vertical, position, with, its, claws, its, exoskeleton, begins, to, split, at, a, weak, spot, behind, the, head, the, adult, dragonfly, crawls, out, of, its, nymph, exoskeleton, the, exuvia, arching, backwards, when, all, but, the, tip, of, its, abdomen, is, free, to, allow, its, exoskeleton, to, harden, curling, back, upwards, it, completes, its, emergence, swallowing, air, which, plumps, out, its, body, and, pumping, haemolymph, into, its, wings, which, causes, them, to, expand, to, their, full, extent, dragonflies, in, temperate, areas, can, be, categorized, into, two, groups, an, early, group, and, a, later, one, in, any, one, area, individuals, of, a, particular, spring, species, emerge, within, a, few, days, of, each, other, the, springtime, darner, basiaeschna, janata, for, example, is, suddenly, very, common, in, the, spring, but, disappears, a, few, weeks, later, and, is, not, seen, again, until, the, following, year, by, contrast, a, summer, species, emerges, over, a, period, of, weeks, or, months, later, in, the, year, they, may, be, seen, on, the, wing, for, several, months, but, this, may, represent, a, whole, series, of, individuals, with, new, adults, hatching, out, as, earlier, ones, complete, their, lifespans, the, sex, ratio, of, male, to, female, dragonflies, varies, both, temporally, and, spatially, adult, dragonflies, have, a, high, male, biased, ratio, at, breeding, habitats, the, male, bias, ratio, has, contributed, partially, to, the, females, using, different, habitats, to, avoid, male, harassment, as, seen, in, hine, s, emerald, dragonfly, somatochlora, hineana, male, populations, use, wetland, habitats, while, females, use, dry, meadows, and, marginal, breeding, habitats, only, migrating, to, the, wetlands, to, lay, their, eggs, or, to, find, mating, partners, unwanted, mating, is, energetically, costly, for, females, because, it, affects, the, amount, of, time, that, they, are, able, to, spend, foraging, dragonflies, are, powerful, and, agile, fliers, capable, of, migrating, across, the, sea, moving, in, any, direction, and, changing, direction, suddenly, in, flight, the, adult, dragonfly, can, propel, itself, in, six, directions, upward, downward, forward, backward, to, left, and, to, right, they, have, four, different, styles, of, flight, the, wings, are, powered, directly, unlike, most, families, of, insects, with, the, flight, muscles, attached, to, the, wing, bases, dragonflies, have, a, high, power, weight, ratio, and, have, been, documented, accelerating, at, 4, g, linearly, and, 9, g, in, sharp, turns, while, pursuing, prey, dragonflies, generate, lift, in, at, least, four, ways, at, different, times, including, classical, lift, like, an, aircraft, wing, supercritical, lift, with, the, wing, above, the, critical, angle, generating, high, lift, and, using, very, short, strokes, to, avoid, stalling, and, creating, and, shedding, vortices, some, families, appear, to, use, special, mechanisms, as, for, example, the, libellulidae, which, take, off, rapidly, their, wings, beginning, pointed, far, forward, and, twisted, almost, vertically, dragonfly, wings, behave, highly, dynamically, during, flight, flexing, and, twisting, during, each, beat, among, the, variables, are, wing, curvature, length, and, speed, of, stroke, angle, of, attack, forward, back, position, of, wing, and, phase, relative, to, the, other, wings, old, and, unreliable, claims, are, made, that, dragonflies, such, as, the, southern, giant, darner, can, fly, up, to, 97, km, h, 60, mph, however, the, greatest, reliable, flight, speed, records, are, for, other, types, of, insects, in, general, large, dragonflies, like, the, hawkers, have, a, maximum, speed, of, 36, 54, km, h, 22, 34, mph, with, average, cruising, speed, of, about, 16, km, h, 9, 9, mph, dragonflies, can, travel, at, 100, body, lengths, per, second, in, forward, flight, and, three, lengths, per, second, backwards, in, high, speed, territorial, battles, between, male, australian, emperors, hemianax, papuensis, the, fighting, dragonflies, adjust, their, flight, paths, to, appear, stationary, to, their, rivals, minimizing, the, chance, of, being, detected, as, they, approach, to, achieve, the, effect, the, attacking, dragonfly, flies, towards, his, rival, choosing, his, path, to, remain, on, a, line, between, the, rival, and, the, start, of, his, attack, path, the, attacker, thus, looms, larger, as, he, closes, on, the, rival, but, does, not, otherwise, appear, to, move, researchers, found, that, six, of, 15, encounters, involved, motion, camouflage, the, flight, muscles, need, to, be, kept, at, a, suitable, temperature, for, the, dragonfly, to, be, able, to, fly, being, cold, blooded, they, can, raise, their, temperature, by, basking, in, the, sun, early, in, the, morning, they, may, choose, to, perch, in, a, vertical, position, with, the, wings, outstretched, while, in, the, middle, of, the, day, a, horizontal, stance, may, be, chosen, another, method, of, warming, up, used, by, some, larger, dragonflies, is, wing, whirring, a, rapid, vibration, of, the, wings, that, causes, heat, to, be, generated, in, the, flight, muscles, the, green, darner, anax, junius, is, known, for, its, long, distance, migrations, and, often, resorts, to, wing, whirring, before, dawn, to, enable, it, to, make, an, early, start, becoming, too, hot, is, another, hazard, and, a, sunny, or, shady, position, for, perching, can, be, selected, according, to, the, ambient, temperature, some, species, have, dark, patches, on, the, wings, which, can, provide, shade, for, the, body, and, a, few, use, the, obelisk, posture, to, avoid, overheating, this, behaviour, involves, doing, a, handstand, perching, with, the, body, raised, and, the, abdomen, pointing, towards, the, sun, thus, minimising, the, amount, of, solar, radiation, received, on, a, hot, day, dragonflies, sometimes, adjust, their, body, temperature, by, skimming, over, a, water, surface, and, briefly, touching, it, often, three, times, in, quick, succession, this, may, also, help, to, avoid, desiccation, adult, dragonflies, hunt, on, the, wing, using, their, exceptionally, acute, eyesight, and, strong, agile, flight, they, are, almost, exclusively, carnivorous, eating, a, wide, variety, of, insects, ranging, from, small, midges, and, mosquitoes, to, butterflies, moths, damselflies, and, smaller, dragonflies, a, large, prey, item, is, subdued, by, being, bitten, on, the, head, and, is, carried, by, the, legs, to, a, perch, here, the, wings, are, discarded, and, the, prey, usually, ingested, head, first, a, dragonfly, may, consume, as, much, as, a, fifth, of, its, body, weight, in, prey, per, day, dragonflies, are, also, some, of, the, insect, world, s, most, efficient, hunters, catching, up, to, 95, of, the, prey, they, pursue, the, nymphs, are, voracious, predators, eating, most, living, things, that, are, smaller, than, they, are, their, staple, diet, is, mostly, bloodworms, and, other, insect, larvae, but, they, also, feed, on, tadpoles, and, small, fish, a, few, species, especially, those, that, live, in, temporary, waters, are, likely, to, leave, the, water, to, feed, nymphs, of, cordulegaster, bidentata, sometimes, hunt, small, arthropods, on, the, ground, at, night, while, some, species, in, the, anax, genus, have, even, been, observed, leaping, out, of, the, water, to, attack, and, kill, full, grown, tree, frogs, dragonfly, vision, is, thought, to, be, like, slow, motion, for, humans, dragonflies, see, faster, than, humans, do, they, see, around, 200, images, per, second, a, dragonfly, can, see, in, 360, degrees, and, nearly, 80, per, cent, of, the, insect, s, brain, is, dedicated, to, its, sight, although, dragonflies, are, swift, and, agile, fliers, some, predators, are, fast, enough, to, catch, them, these, include, falcons, such, as, the, american, kestrel, the, merlin, and, the, hobby, nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers, and, swallows, also, take, some, adults, some, species, of, wasps, too, prey, on, dragonflies, using, them, to, provision, their, nests, laying, an, egg, on, each, captured, insect, in, the, water, various, species, of, ducks, and, herons, eat, dragonfly, nymphs, and, they, are, also, preyed, on, by, newts, frogs, fish, and, water, spiders, amur, falcons, which, migrate, over, the, indian, ocean, at, a, period, that, coincides, with, the, migration, of, the, globe, skimmer, dragonfly, pantala, flavescens, may, actually, be, feeding, on, them, while, on, the, wing, dragonflies, are, affected, by, three, groups, of, parasites, water, mites, gregarine, protozoa, and, trematode, flatworms, flukes, water, mites, hydracarina, can, kill, smaller, dragonfly, nymphs, and, may, also, be, seen, on, adults, gregarines, infect, the, gut, and, may, cause, blockage, and, secondary, infection, trematodes, are, parasites, of, vertebrates, such, as, frogs, with, complex, life, cycles, often, involving, a, period, as, a, stage, called, a, cercaria, in, a, secondary, host, a, snail, dragonfly, nymphs, may, swallow, cercariae, or, these, may, tunnel, through, a, nymph, s, body, wall, they, then, enter, the, gut, and, form, a, cyst, or, metacercaria, which, remains, in, the, nymph, for, the, whole, of, its, development, if, the, nymph, is, eaten, by, a, frog, the, amphibian, becomes, infected, by, the, adult, or, fluke, stage, of, the, trematode, most, odonatologists, live, in, temperate, areas, and, the, dragonflies, of, north, america, and, europe, have, been, the, subject, of, much, research, however, the, majority, of, species, live, in, tropical, areas, and, have, been, little, studied, with, the, destruction, of, rainforest, habitats, many, of, these, species, are, in, danger, of, becoming, extinct, before, they, have, even, been, named, the, greatest, cause, of, decline, is, forest, clearance, with, the, consequent, drying, up, of, streams, and, pools, which, become, clogged, with, silt, the, damming, of, rivers, for, hydroelectric, schemes, and, the, drainage, of, low, lying, land, has, reduced, suitable, habitat, as, has, pollution, and, the, introduction, of, alien, species, in, 1997, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, set, up, a, status, survey, and, conservation, action, plan, for, dragonflies, this, proposes, the, establishment, of, protected, areas, around, the, world, and, the, management, of, these, areas, to, provide, suitable, habitat, for, dragonflies, outside, these, areas, encouragement, should, be, given, to, modify, forestry, agricultural, and, industrial, practices, to, enhance, conservation, at, the, same, time, more, research, into, dragonflies, needs, to, be, done, consideration, should, be, given, to, pollution, control, and, the, public, should, be, educated, about, the, importance, of, biodiversity, habitat, degradation, has, reduced, dragonfly, populations, across, the, world, for, example, in, japan, over, 60, of, japan, s, wetlands, were, lost, in, the, 20th, century, so, its, dragonflies, now, depend, largely, on, rice, fields, ponds, and, creeks, dragonflies, feed, on, pest, insects, in, rice, acting, as, a, natural, pest, control, dragonflies, are, steadily, declining, in, africa, and, represent, a, conservation, priority, the, dragonfly, s, long, lifespan, and, low, population, density, makes, it, vulnerable, to, disturbance, such, as, from, collisions, with, vehicles, on, roads, built, near, wetlands, species, that, fly, low, and, slow, may, be, most, at, risk, dragonflies, are, attracted, to, shiny, surfaces, that, produce, polarization, which, they, can, mistake, for, water, and, they, have, been, known, to, aggregate, close, to, polished, gravestones, solar, panels, automobiles, and, other, such, structures, on, which, they, attempt, to, lay, eggs, these, can, have, a, local, impact, on, dragonfly, populations, methods, of, reducing, the, attractiveness, of, structures, such, as, solar, panels, are, under, experimentation, a, blue, glazed, faience, dragonfly, amulet, was, found, by, flinders, petrie, at, lahun, from, the, late, middle, kingdom, of, ancient, egypt, for, the, navajo, dragonflies, symbolize, pure, water, often, stylized, in, a, double, barred, cross, design, dragonflies, are, a, common, motif, in, zuni, pottery, as, well, as, hopi, rock, art, and, pueblo, necklaces, 20, 26, as, a, seasonal, symbol, in, japan, dragonflies, are, associated, with, the, season, of, autumn, in, japan, they, are, symbols, of, rebirth, courage, strength, and, happiness, they, are, also, depicted, frequently, in, japanese, art, and, literature, especially, haiku, poetry, japanese, children, catch, large, dragonflies, as, a, game, using, a, hair, with, a, small, pebble, tied, to, each, end, which, they, throw, into, the, air, the, dragonfly, mistakes, the, pebbles, for, prey, gets, tangled, in, the, hair, and, is, dragged, to, the, ground, by, the, weight, 38, in, both, china, and, japan, dragonflies, have, been, used, in, traditional, medicine, in, indonesia, adult, dragonflies, are, caught, on, poles, made, sticky, with, birdlime, then, fried, in, oil, as, a, delicacy, images, of, dragonflies, are, common, in, art, nouveau, especially, in, jewellery, designs, they, have, also, been, used, as, a, decorative, motif, on, fabrics, and, home, furnishings, douglas, a, british, motorcycle, manufacturer, based, in, bristol, named, its, innovatively, designed, postwar, 350, cc, flat, twin, model, the, dragonfly, among, the, classical, names, of, japan, are, akitsukuni, akitsushima, toyo, akitsushima, akitsu, is, an, old, word, for, dragonfly, so, one, interpretation, of, akitsushima, is, dragonfly, island, this, is, attributed, to, a, legend, in, which, japan, s, mythical, founder, emperor, jimmu, was, bitten, by, a, mosquito, which, was, then, eaten, by, a, dragonfly, in, europe, dragonflies, have, often, been, seen, as, sinister, some, english, vernacular, names, such, as, horse, stinger, devil, s, darning, needle, and, ear, cutter, link, them, with, evil, and, injury, some, of, these, reference, the, popular, misconception, that, dragonflies, can, bite, or, sting, humans, swedish, folklore, holds, that, the, devil, uses, dragonflies, to, weigh, people, s, souls, 25, 27, the, norwegian, name, for, dragonflies, is, yenstikker, eye, poker, and, in, portugal, they, are, sometimes, called, tira, olhos, eyes, snatcher, they, are, often, associated, with, snakes, as, in, the, welsh, name, gwas, y, neidr, adder, s, servant, the, southern, united, states, terms, snake, doctor, and, snake, feeder, refer, to, a, folk, belief, that, dragonflies, catch, insects, for, snakes, or, follow, snakes, around, and, stitch, them, back, together, if, they, are, injured, interestingly, the, hungarian, name, for, dragonfly, is, szitak, t, sieve, knitter, the, watercolourist, moses, harris, 1731, 1785, known, for, his, the, aurelian, or, natural, history, of, english, insects, 1766, published, in, 1780, the, first, scientific, descriptions, of, several, odonata, including, the, banded, demoiselle, calopteryx, splendens, he, was, the, first, english, artist, to, make, illustrations, of, dragonflies, accurate, enough, to, be, identified, to, species, aeshna, grandis, at, top, left, of, plate, illustrated, though, his, rough, drawing, of, a, nymph, at, lower, left, with, the, mask, extended, appears, to, be, plagiarised, more, recently, dragonfly, watching, has, become, popular, in, america, as, some, birdwatchers, seek, new, groups, to, observe, in, heraldry, like, other, winged, insects, the, dragonfly, is, typically, depicted, tergiant, with, its, back, facing, the, viewer, with, its, head, to, chief, at, the, top, lafcadio, hearn, wrote, in, his, 1901, book, a, japanese, miscellany, that, japanese, poets, had, created, dragonfly, haiku, almost, as, numerous, as, are, the, dragonflies, themselves, in, the, early, autumn, the, poet, matsuo, bash, 1644, 1694, wrote, haiku, such, as, crimson, pepper, pod, add, two, pairs, of, wings, and, look, darting, dragonfly, relating, the, autumn, season, to, the, dragonfly, hori, bakusui, 1718, 1783, similarly, wrote, dyed, he, is, with, the, colour, of, autumnal, days, o, red, dragonfly, the, poet, lord, tennyson, described, a, dragonfly, splitting, its, old, skin, and, emerging, shining, metallic, blue, like, sapphire, mail, in, his, 1842, poem, the, two, voices, with, the, lines, an, inner, impulse, rent, the, veil, of, his, old, husk, from, head, to, tail, came, out, clear, plates, of, sapphire, mail, the, novelist, h, e, bates, described, the, rapid, agile, flight, of, dragonflies, in, his, 1937, nonfiction, book, down, the, river, i, saw, once, an, endless, procession, just, over, an, area, of, water, lilies, of, small, sapphire, dragonflies, a, continuous, play, of, blue, gauze, over, the, snowy, flowers, above, the, sun, glassy, water, it, was, all, confined, in, true, dragonfly, fashion, to, one, small, space, it, was, a, continuous, turning, and, returning, an, endless, darting, poising, striking, and, hovering, so, swift, that, it, was, often, lost, in, sunlight, a, dragonfly, has, been, genetically, modified, with, light, sensitive, steering, neurons, in, its, nerve, cord, to, create, a, cyborg, like, dragonfleye, the, neurons, contain, genes, like, those, in, the, eye, to, make, them, sensitive, to, light, miniature, sensors, a, computer, chip, and, a, solar, panel, were, fitted, in, a, backpack, over, the, insect, s, thorax, in, front, of, its, wings, light, is, sent, down, flexible, light, pipes, named, optrodes, from, the, backpack, into, the, nerve, cord, to, give, steering, commands, to, the, insect, the, result, is, a, micro, aerial, vehicle, that, s, smaller, lighter, and, stealthier, than, anything, else, that, s, manmade
