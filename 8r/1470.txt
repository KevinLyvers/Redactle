personality, disorders, pd, are, a, class, of, mental, disorders, characterized, by, enduring, maladaptive, patterns, of, behavior, cognition, and, inner, experience, exhibited, across, many, contexts, and, deviating, from, those, accepted, by, the, individual, s, culture, these, patterns, develop, early, are, inflexible, and, are, associated, with, significant, distress, or, disability, the, definitions, vary, by, source, and, remain, a, matter, of, controversy, official, criteria, for, diagnosing, personality, disorders, are, listed, in, the, sixth, chapter, of, the, international, classification, of, diseases, icd, and, in, the, american, psychiatric, association, s, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, personality, defined, psychologically, is, the, set, of, enduring, behavioral, and, mental, traits, that, distinguish, individual, humans, hence, personality, disorders, are, defined, by, experiences, and, behaviors, that, deviate, from, social, norms, and, expectations, those, diagnosed, with, a, personality, disorder, may, experience, difficulties, in, cognition, emotiveness, interpersonal, functioning, or, impulse, control, for, psychiatric, patients, the, prevalence, of, personality, disorders, is, estimated, between, 40, and, 60, the, behavior, patterns, of, personality, disorders, are, typically, recognized, by, adolescence, the, beginning, of, adulthood, or, sometimes, even, childhood, and, often, have, a, pervasive, negative, impact, on, the, quality, of, life, treatment, for, personality, disorders, is, primarily, psychotherapeutic, evidence, based, psychotherapies, for, personality, disorders, include, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, and, dialectical, behavior, therapy, especially, for, borderline, personality, disorder, a, variety, of, psychoanalytic, approaches, are, also, used, personality, disorders, are, associated, with, considerable, stigma, in, popular, and, clinical, discourse, alike, despite, various, methodological, schemas, designed, to, categorize, personality, disorders, many, issues, occur, with, classifying, a, personality, disorder, because, the, theory, and, diagnosis, of, such, disorders, occur, within, prevailing, cultural, expectations, thus, their, validity, is, contested, by, some, experts, on, the, basis, of, inevitable, subjectivity, they, argue, that, the, theory, and, diagnosis, of, personality, disorders, are, based, strictly, on, social, or, even, sociopolitical, and, economic, considerations, the, two, latest, editions, of, the, major, systems, of, classification, are, the, icd, is, a, collection, of, alpha, numerical, codes, which, have, been, assigned, to, all, known, clinical, states, and, provides, uniform, terminology, for, medical, records, billing, statistics, and, research, the, dsm, defines, psychiatric, diagnoses, based, on, research, and, expert, consensus, both, have, deliberately, aligned, their, diagnoses, to, some, extent, but, some, differences, remain, for, example, the, icd, 10, included, narcissistic, personality, disorder, in, the, group, of, other, specific, personality, disorders, while, dsm, 5, does, not, include, enduring, personality, change, after, catastrophic, experience, the, icd, 10, classified, the, dsm, 5, schizotypal, personality, disorder, as, a, form, of, schizophrenia, rather, than, as, a, personality, disorder, there, are, accepted, diagnostic, issues, and, controversies, with, regard, to, distinguishing, particular, personality, disorder, categories, from, each, other, dissociative, identity, disorder, previously, known, as, multiple, personality, as, well, as, multiple, personality, disorder, has, always, been, classified, as, a, dissociative, disorder, and, never, was, regarded, as, a, personality, disorder, the, most, recent, fifth, edition, of, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, stresses, that, a, personality, disorder, is, an, enduring, and, inflexible, pattern, of, long, duration, leading, to, significant, distress, or, impairment, and, is, not, due, to, use, of, substances, or, another, medical, condition, the, dsm, 5, lists, personality, disorders, in, the, same, way, as, other, mental, disorders, rather, than, on, a, separate, axis, as, previously, dsm, 5, lists, ten, specific, personality, disorders, paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal, antisocial, borderline, histrionic, narcissistic, avoidant, dependent, and, obsessive, compulsive, personality, disorder, the, dsm, 5, also, contains, three, diagnoses, for, personality, patterns, not, matching, these, ten, disorders, which, nevertheless, exhibit, characteristics, of, a, personality, disorder, these, specific, personality, disorders, are, grouped, into, the, following, three, clusters, based, on, descriptive, similarities, cluster, a, personality, disorders, are, often, associated, with, schizophrenia, people, with, these, disorders, can, be, paranoid, and, have, difficulty, being, understood, by, others, as, they, often, have, odd, or, eccentric, modes, of, speaking, and, an, unwillingness, and, inability, to, form, and, maintain, close, relationships, significant, evidence, suggests, a, small, proportion, of, people, with, cluster, a, personality, disorders, especially, schizotypal, personality, disorder, have, the, potential, to, develop, schizophrenia, and, other, psychotic, disorders, these, disorders, also, have, a, higher, probability, of, occurring, among, individuals, whose, first, degree, relatives, have, either, schizophrenia, or, a, cluster, a, personality, disorder, cluster, b, personality, disorders, are, characterized, by, dramatic, impulsive, self, destructive, emotional, behavior, and, sometimes, incomprehensible, interactions, with, others, group, c, personality, disorders, are, characterised, by, a, consistent, pattern, of, anxious, thinking, or, behavior, both, the, dsm, 5, and, the, icd, 11, diagnostic, systems, provide, a, definition, and, six, criteria, for, a, general, personality, disorder, these, criteria, should, be, met, by, all, personality, disorder, cases, before, a, more, specific, diagnosis, can, be, made, the, dsm, 5, indicates, that, any, personality, disorder, diagnosis, must, meet, the, following, criteria, the, icd, 11, personality, disorder, section, differs, substantially, from, the, previous, edition, icd, 10, all, distinct, pds, have, been, merged, into, one, personality, disorder, 6d10, which, can, be, coded, as, mild, 6d10, 0, moderate, 6d10, 1, severe, 6d10, 2, or, severity, unspecified, 6d10, z, there, is, also, an, additional, category, called, personality, difficulty, qe50, 7, which, can, be, used, to, describe, personality, traits, that, are, problematic, but, do, not, meet, the, diagnostic, criteria, for, a, pd, a, personality, disorder, or, difficulty, can, be, specified, by, one, or, more, prominent, personality, traits, or, patterns, 6d11, the, icd, 11, uses, five, trait, domains, listed, directly, underneath, is, borderline, pattern, 6d11, 5, a, category, similar, to, borderline, personality, disorder, this, is, not, a, trait, in, itself, but, a, combination, of, the, five, traits, in, certain, severity, in, the, icd, 11, any, personality, disorder, must, meet, all, of, the, following, criteria, the, icd, 10, lists, these, general, guideline, criteria, the, icd, adds, for, different, cultures, it, may, be, necessary, to, develop, specific, sets, of, criteria, with, regard, to, social, norms, rules, and, obligations, chapter, v, in, the, icd, 10, contains, the, mental, and, behavioral, disorders, and, includes, categories, of, personality, disorder, and, enduring, personality, changes, they, are, defined, as, ingrained, patterns, indicated, by, inflexible, and, disabling, responses, that, significantly, differ, from, how, the, average, person, in, the, culture, perceives, thinks, and, feels, particularly, in, relating, to, others, the, specific, personality, disorders, are, paranoid, schizoid, schizotypal, dissocial, emotionally, unstable, borderline, type, and, impulsive, type, histrionic, narcissistic, anankastic, anxious, avoidant, and, dependent, besides, the, ten, specific, pd, there, are, the, following, categories, some, types, of, personality, disorder, were, in, previous, versions, of, the, diagnostic, manuals, but, have, been, deleted, examples, include, sadistic, personality, disorder, pervasive, pattern, of, cruel, demeaning, and, aggressive, behavior, and, self, defeating, personality, disorder, or, masochistic, personality, disorder, characterized, by, behavior, consequently, undermining, the, person, s, pleasure, and, goals, they, were, listed, in, the, dsm, iii, r, appendix, as, proposed, diagnostic, categories, needing, further, study, without, specific, criteria, psychologist, theodore, millon, a, researcher, on, personality, disorders, and, other, researchers, consider, some, relegated, diagnoses, to, be, equally, valid, disorders, and, may, also, propose, other, personality, disorders, or, subtypes, including, mixtures, of, aspects, of, different, categories, of, the, officially, accepted, diagnoses, millon, proposed, the, following, description, of, personality, disorders, in, addition, to, classifying, by, category, and, cluster, it, is, possible, to, classify, personality, disorders, using, additional, factors, such, as, severity, impact, on, social, functioning, and, attribution, this, involves, both, the, notion, of, personality, difficulty, as, a, measure, of, subthreshold, scores, for, personality, disorder, using, standard, interviews, and, the, evidence, that, those, with, the, most, severe, personality, disorders, demonstrate, a, ripple, effect, of, personality, disturbance, across, the, whole, range, of, mental, disorders, in, addition, to, subthreshold, personality, difficulty, and, single, cluster, simple, personality, disorder, this, also, derives, complex, or, diffuse, personality, disorder, two, or, more, clusters, of, personality, disorder, present, and, can, also, derive, severe, personality, disorder, for, those, of, greatest, risk, there, are, several, advantages, to, classifying, personality, disorder, by, severity, social, function, is, affected, by, many, other, aspects, of, mental, functioning, apart, from, that, of, personality, however, whenever, there, is, persistently, impaired, social, functioning, in, conditions, in, which, it, would, normally, not, be, expected, the, evidence, suggests, that, this, is, more, likely, to, be, created, by, personality, abnormality, than, by, other, clinical, variables, the, personality, assessment, schedule, gives, social, function, priority, in, creating, a, hierarchy, in, which, the, personality, disorder, creating, the, greater, social, dysfunction, is, given, primacy, over, others, in, a, subsequent, description, of, personality, disorder, many, who, have, a, personality, disorder, do, not, recognize, any, abnormality, and, defend, valiantly, their, continued, occupancy, of, their, personality, role, this, group, have, been, termed, the, type, r, or, treatment, resisting, personality, disorders, as, opposed, to, the, type, s, or, treatment, seeking, ones, who, are, keen, on, altering, their, personality, disorders, and, sometimes, clamor, for, treatment, the, classification, of, 68, personality, disordered, patients, on, the, caseload, of, an, assertive, community, team, using, a, simple, scale, showed, a, 3, to, 1, ratio, between, type, r, and, type, s, personality, disorders, with, cluster, c, personality, disorders, being, significantly, more, likely, to, be, type, s, and, paranoid, and, schizoid, cluster, a, personality, disorders, significantly, more, likely, to, be, type, r, than, others, psychoanalytic, theory, has, been, used, to, explain, treatment, resistant, tendencies, as, egosyntonic, i, e, the, patterns, are, consistent, with, the, ego, integrity, of, the, individual, and, are, therefore, perceived, to, be, appropriate, by, that, individual, in, addition, this, behavior, can, result, in, maladaptive, coping, skills, and, may, lead, to, personal, problems, that, induce, extreme, anxiety, distress, or, depression, and, result, in, impaired, psychosocial, functioning, there, is, a, considerable, personality, disorder, diagnostic, co, occurrence, patients, who, meet, the, dsm, iv, tr, diagnostic, criteria, for, one, personality, disorder, are, likely, to, meet, the, diagnostic, criteria, for, another, diagnostic, categories, provide, clear, vivid, descriptions, of, discrete, personality, types, but, the, personality, structure, of, actual, patients, might, be, more, accurately, described, by, a, constellation, of, maladaptive, personality, traits, sites, used, dsm, iii, r, criterion, sets, data, obtained, for, purposes, of, informing, the, development, of, the, dsm, iv, tr, personality, disorder, diagnostic, criteria, abbreviations, used, ppd, paranoid, personality, disorder, szpd, schizoid, personality, disorder, stpd, schizotypal, personality, disorder, aspd, antisocial, personality, disorder, bpd, borderline, personality, disorder, hpd, histrionic, personality, disorder, npd, narcissistic, personality, disorder, avpd, avoidant, personality, disorder, dpd, dependent, personality, disorder, ocpd, obsessive, compulsive, personality, disorder, papd, passive, aggressive, personality, disorder, the, disorders, in, each, of, the, three, clusters, may, share, with, each, other, underlying, common, vulnerability, factors, involving, cognition, affect, and, impulse, control, and, behavioral, maintenance, or, inhibition, respectively, but, they, may, also, have, a, spectrum, relationship, to, certain, syndromal, mental, disorders, it, is, generally, assumed, that, all, personality, disorders, are, linked, to, impaired, functioning, and, a, reduced, quality, of, life, qol, because, that, is, a, basic, diagnostic, requirement, but, research, shows, that, this, may, be, true, only, for, some, types, of, personality, disorder, in, several, studies, higher, levels, of, disability, and, lower, qol, were, predicted, by, avoidant, dependent, schizoid, paranoid, schizotypal, and, antisocial, personality, disorders, this, link, is, particularly, strong, for, avoidant, schizotypal, and, borderline, pd, however, obsessive, compulsive, pd, was, not, related, to, a, reduced, qol, or, increased, impairment, a, prospective, study, reported, that, all, pd, were, associated, with, significant, impairment, 15, years, later, except, for, obsessive, compulsive, and, narcissistic, personality, disorder, one, study, investigated, some, aspects, of, life, success, status, wealth, and, successful, intimate, relationships, it, showed, somewhat, poor, functioning, for, schizotypal, antisocial, borderline, and, dependent, pd, schizoid, pd, had, the, lowest, scores, regarding, these, variables, paranoid, histrionic, and, avoidant, pd, were, average, narcissistic, and, obsessive, compulsive, pd, however, had, high, functioning, and, appeared, to, contribute, rather, positively, to, these, aspects, of, life, success, there, is, also, a, direct, relationship, between, the, number, of, diagnostic, criteria, and, quality, of, life, for, each, additional, personality, disorder, criterion, that, a, person, meets, there, is, an, even, reduction, in, quality, of, life, personality, disorders, especially, dependent, narcissistic, and, sadistic, personality, disorders, also, facilitate, various, forms, of, counterproductive, work, behavior, including, knowledge, hiding, and, knowledge, sabotage, depending, on, the, diagnosis, severity, and, individual, and, the, job, itself, personality, disorders, can, be, associated, with, difficulty, coping, with, work, or, the, workplace, potentially, leading, to, problems, with, others, by, interfering, with, interpersonal, relationships, indirect, effects, also, play, a, role, for, example, impaired, educational, progress, or, complications, outside, of, work, such, as, substance, abuse, and, co, morbid, mental, disorders, can, be, problematic, however, personality, disorders, can, also, bring, about, above, average, work, abilities, by, increasing, competitive, drive, or, causing, the, individual, with, the, condition, to, exploit, his, or, her, co, workers, in, 2005, and, again, in, 2009, psychologists, belinda, board, and, katarina, fritzon, at, the, university, of, surrey, uk, interviewed, and, gave, personality, tests, to, high, level, british, executives, and, compared, their, profiles, with, those, of, criminal, psychiatric, patients, at, broadmoor, hospital, in, the, uk, they, found, that, three, out, of, eleven, personality, disorders, were, actually, more, common, in, executives, than, in, the, disturbed, criminals, according, to, leadership, academic, manfred, f, r, kets, de, vries, it, seems, almost, inevitable, that, some, personality, disorders, will, be, present, in, a, senior, management, team, early, stages, and, preliminary, forms, of, personality, disorders, need, a, multi, dimensional, and, early, treatment, approach, personality, development, disorder, is, considered, to, be, a, childhood, risk, factor, or, early, stage, of, a, later, personality, disorder, in, adulthood, in, addition, in, robert, f, krueger, s, review, of, their, research, indicates, that, some, children, and, adolescents, do, experience, clinically, significant, syndromes, that, resemble, adult, personality, disorders, and, that, these, syndromes, have, meaningful, correlates, and, are, consequential, much, of, this, research, has, been, framed, by, the, adult, personality, disorder, constructs, from, axis, ii, of, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, hence, they, are, less, likely, to, encounter, the, first, risk, they, described, at, the, outset, of, their, review, clinicians, and, researchers, are, not, simply, avoiding, use, of, the, pd, construct, in, youth, however, they, may, encounter, the, second, risk, they, described, under, appreciation, of, the, developmental, context, in, which, these, syndromes, occur, that, is, although, pd, constructs, show, continuity, over, time, they, are, probabilistic, predictors, not, all, youths, who, exhibit, pd, symptomatology, become, adult, pd, cases, the, issue, of, the, relationship, between, normal, personality, and, personality, disorders, is, one, of, the, important, issues, in, personality, and, clinical, psychology, the, personality, disorders, classification, dsm, 5, and, icd, 10, follows, a, categorical, approach, that, views, personality, disorders, as, discrete, entities, that, are, distinct, from, each, other, and, from, normal, personality, in, contrast, the, dimensional, approach, is, an, alternative, approach, that, personality, disorders, represent, maladaptive, extensions, of, the, same, traits, that, describe, normal, personality, thomas, widiger, and, his, collaborators, have, contributed, to, this, debate, significantly, he, discussed, the, constraints, of, the, categorical, approach, and, argued, for, the, dimensional, approach, to, the, personality, disorders, specifically, he, proposed, the, five, factor, model, of, personality, as, an, alternative, to, the, classification, of, personality, disorders, for, example, this, view, specifies, that, borderline, personality, disorder, can, be, understood, as, a, combination, of, emotional, lability, i, e, high, neuroticism, impulsivity, i, e, low, conscientiousness, and, hostility, i, e, low, agreeableness, many, studies, across, cultures, have, explored, the, relationship, between, personality, disorders, and, the, five, factor, model, this, research, has, demonstrated, that, personality, disorders, largely, correlate, in, expected, ways, with, measures, of, the, five, factor, model, and, has, set, the, stage, for, including, the, five, factor, model, within, dsm, 5, in, clinical, practice, individuals, are, generally, diagnosed, by, an, interview, with, a, psychiatrist, based, on, a, mental, status, examination, which, may, take, into, account, observations, by, relatives, and, others, one, tool, of, diagnosing, personality, disorders, is, a, process, involving, interviews, with, scoring, systems, the, patient, is, asked, to, answer, questions, and, depending, on, their, answers, the, trained, interviewer, tries, to, code, what, their, responses, were, this, process, is, fairly, time, consuming, abbreviations, used, ppd, paranoid, personality, disorder, szpd, schizoid,

were, over, fifty, published, studies, relating, the, five, factor, model, ffm, to, personality, disorders, since, that, time, quite, a, number, of, additional, studies, have, expanded, on, this, research, base, and, provided, further, empirical, support, for, understanding, the, dsm, personality, disorders, in, terms, of, the, ffm, domains, in, her, seminal, review, of, the, personality, disorder, literature, published, in, 2007, lee, anna, clark, asserted, that, the, five, factor, model, of, personality, is, widely, accepted, as, representing, the, higher, order, structure, of, both, normal, and, abnormal, personality, traits, the, five, factor, model, has, been, shown, to, significantly, predict, all, 10, personality, disorder, symptoms, and, outperform, the, minnesota, multiphasic, personality, inventory, mmpi, in, the, prediction, of, borderline, avoidant, and, dependent, personality, disorder, symptoms, research, results, examining, the, relationships, between, the, ffm, and, each, of, the, ten, dsm, personality, disorder, diagnostic, categories, are, widely, available, for, example, in, a, study, published, in, 2003, titled, the, five, factor, model, and, personality, disorder, empirical, literature, a, meta, analytic, review, the, authors, analyzed, data, from, 15, other, studies, to, determine, how, personality, disorders, are, different, and, similar, respectively, with, regard, to, underlying, personality, traits, in, terms, of, how, personality, disorders, differ, the, results, showed, that, each, disorder, displays, a, ffm, profile, that, is, meaningful, and, predictable, given, its, unique, diagnostic, criteria, with, regard, to, their, similarities, the, findings, revealed, that, the, most, prominent, and, consistent, personality, dimensions, underlying, a, large, number, of, the, personality, disorders, are, positive, associations, with, neuroticism, and, negative, associations, with, agreeableness, at, least, three, aspects, of, openness, to, experience, are, relevant, to, understanding, personality, disorders, cognitive, distortions, lack, of, insight, means, the, ability, to, recognize, one, s, own, mental, illness, and, impulsivity, problems, related, to, high, openness, that, can, cause, problems, with, social, or, professional, functioning, are, excessive, fantasising, peculiar, thinking, diffuse, identity, unstable, goals, and, nonconformity, with, the, demands, of, the, society, high, openness, is, characteristic, to, schizotypal, personality, disorder, odd, and, fragmented, thinking, narcissistic, personality, disorder, excessive, self, valuation, and, paranoid, personality, disorder, sensitivity, to, external, hostility, lack, of, insight, shows, low, openness, is, characteristic, to, all, personality, disorders, and, could, help, explain, the, persistence, of, maladaptive, behavioral, patterns, the, problems, associated, with, low, openness, are, difficulties, adapting, to, change, low, tolerance, for, different, worldviews, or, lifestyles, emotional, flattening, alexithymia, and, a, narrow, range, of, interests, rigidity, is, the, most, obvious, aspect, of, low, openness, among, personality, disorders, and, that, shows, lack, of, knowledge, of, one, s, emotional, experiences, it, is, most, characteristic, of, obsessive, compulsive, personality, disorder, the, opposite, of, it, known, as, impulsivity, here, an, aspect, of, openness, that, shows, a, tendency, to, behave, unusually, or, autistically, is, characteristic, of, schizotypal, and, borderline, personality, disorders, currently, there, are, no, definitive, proven, causes, for, personality, disorders, however, there, are, numerous, possible, causes, and, known, risk, factors, supported, by, scientific, research, that, vary, depending, on, the, disorder, the, individual, and, the, circumstance, overall, findings, show, that, genetic, disposition, and, life, experiences, such, as, trauma, and, abuse, play, a, key, role, in, the, development, of, personality, disorders, child, abuse, and, neglect, consistently, show, up, as, risk, factors, to, the, development, of, personality, disorders, in, adulthood, a, study, looked, at, retrospective, reports, of, abuse, of, participants, that, had, demonstrated, psychopathology, throughout, their, life, and, were, later, found, to, have, past, experience, with, abuse, in, a, study, of, 793, mothers, and, children, researchers, asked, mothers, if, they, had, screamed, at, their, children, and, told, them, that, they, did, not, love, them, or, threatened, to, send, them, away, children, who, had, experienced, such, verbal, abuse, were, three, times, as, likely, as, other, children, who, did, not, experience, such, verbal, abuse, to, have, borderline, narcissistic, obsessive, compulsive, or, paranoid, personality, disorders, in, adulthood, the, sexually, abused, group, demonstrated, the, most, consistently, elevated, patterns, of, psychopathology, officially, verified, physical, abuse, showed, an, extremely, strong, correlation, with, the, development, of, antisocial, and, impulsive, behavior, on, the, other, hand, cases, of, abuse, of, the, neglectful, type, that, created, childhood, pathology, were, found, to, be, subject, to, partial, remission, in, adulthood, socioeconomic, status, has, also, been, looked, at, as, a, potential, cause, for, personality, disorders, there, is, a, strong, association, with, low, parental, neighborhood, socioeconomic, status, and, personality, disorder, symptoms, in, a, 2015, publication, from, bonn, germany, which, compared, parental, socioeconomic, status, and, a, child, s, personality, it, was, seen, that, children, who, were, from, higher, socioeconomic, backgrounds, were, more, altruistic, less, risk, seeking, and, had, overall, higher, iqs, these, traits, correlate, with, a, low, risk, of, developing, personality, disorders, later, on, in, life, in, a, study, looking, at, female, children, who, were, detained, for, disciplinary, actions, found, that, psychological, problems, were, most, negatively, associated, with, socioeconomic, problems, furthermore, social, disorganization, was, found, to, be, inversely, correlated, with, personality, disorder, symptoms, evidence, shows, personality, disorders, may, begin, with, parental, personality, issues, these, cause, the, child, to, have, their, own, difficulties, in, adulthood, such, as, difficulties, reaching, higher, education, obtaining, jobs, and, securing, dependable, relationships, by, either, genetic, or, modeling, mechanisms, children, can, pick, up, these, traits, additionally, poor, parenting, appears, to, have, symptom, elevating, effects, on, personality, disorders, more, specifically, lack, of, maternal, bonding, has, also, been, correlated, with, personality, disorders, in, a, study, comparing, 100, healthy, individuals, to, 100, borderline, personality, disorder, patients, analysis, showed, that, bpd, patients, were, significantly, more, likely, not, to, have, been, breastfed, as, a, baby, 42, 4, in, bpd, vs, 9, 2, in, healthy, controls, these, researchers, suggested, breastfeeding, may, act, as, an, early, indicator, of, the, mother, infant, relationship, that, seems, to, be, relevant, for, bonding, and, attachment, later, in, life, additionally, findings, suggest, personality, disorders, show, a, negative, correlation, with, two, attachment, variables, maternal, availability, and, dependability, when, left, unfostered, other, attachment, and, interpersonal, problems, occur, later, in, life, ultimately, leading, to, development, of, personality, disorders, currently, genetic, research, for, the, understanding, of, the, development, of, personality, disorders, is, severely, lacking, however, there, are, a, few, possible, risk, factors, currently, in, discovery, researchers, are, currently, looking, into, genetic, mechanisms, for, traits, such, as, aggression, fear, and, anxiety, which, are, associated, with, diagnosed, individuals, more, research, is, being, conducted, into, disorder, specific, mechanisms, research, shows, that, several, brain, regions, are, altered, in, personality, disorders, particularly, hippocampus, up, to, 18, smaller, a, smaller, amygdala,

forms, modalities, of, treatment, used, for, personality, disorders, there, are, different, specific, theories, or, schools, of, therapy, within, many, of, these, modalities, they, may, for, example, emphasize, psychodynamic, techniques, or, cognitive, or, behavioral, techniques, in, clinical, practice, many, therapists, use, an, eclectic, approach, taking, elements, of, different, schools, as, and, when, they, seem, to, fit, to, an, individual, client, there, is, also, often, a, focus, on, common, themes, that, seem, to, be, beneficial, regardless, of, techniques, including, attributes, of, the, therapist, e, g, trustworthiness, competence, caring, processes, afforded, to, the, client, e, g, ability, to, express, and, confide, difficulties, and, emotions, and, the, match, between, the,

management, and, treatment, of, personality, disorders, can, be, a, challenging, and, controversial, area, for, by, definition, the, difficulties, have, been, enduring, and, affect, multiple, areas, of, functioning, this, often, involves, interpersonal, issues, and, there, can, be, difficulties, in, seeking, and, obtaining, help, from, organizations, in, the, first, place, as, well, as, with, establishing, and, maintaining, a, specific, therapeutic, relationship, on, the, one, hand, an, individual, may, not, consider, themselves, to, have, a, mental, health, problem, while, on, the, other, community, mental, health, services, may, view, individuals, with, personality, disorders, as, too, complex, or, difficult, and, may, directly, or, indirectly, exclude, individuals, with, such, diagnoses, or, associated, behaviors, the, disruptiveness, that, people, with, personality, disorders, can, create, in, an, organisation, makes, these, arguably, the, most, challenging, conditions, to, manage, apart, from, all, these, issues, an, individual, may, not, consider, their, personality, to, be, disordered, or, the, cause, of, problems, this, perspective, may, be, caused, by, the, patient, s, ignorance, or, lack, of, insight, into, their, own, condition, an, ego, syntonic, perception, of, the, problems, with, their, personality, that, prevents, them, from, experiencing, it, as, being, in, conflict, with, their, goals, and, self, image, or, by, the, simple, fact, that, there, is, no, distinct, or, objective, boundary, between, normal, and, abnormal, personalities, there, is, substantial, social, stigma, and, discrimination, related, to, the, diagnosis, the, term, personality, disorder, encompasses, a, wide, range, of, issues, each, with, a, different, level, of, severity, or, impairment, thus, personality, disorders, can, require, fundamentally, different, approaches, and, understandings, to, illustrate, the, scope, of, the, matter, consider, that, while, some, disorders, or, individuals, are, characterized, by, continual, social, withdrawal, and, the, shunning, of, relationships, others, may, cause, fluctuations, in, forwardness, the, extremes, are, worse, still, at, one, extreme, lie, self, harm, and, self, neglect, while, at, another, extreme, some, individuals, may, commit, violence, and, crime, there, can, be, other, factors, such, as, problematic, substance, use, or, dependency, or, behavioral, addictions, therapists, in, this, area, can, become, disheartened, by, lack, of, initial, progress, or, by, apparent, progress, that, then, leads, to, setbacks, clients, may, be, perceived, as, negative, rejecting, demanding, aggressive, or, manipulative, this, has, been, looked, at, in, terms, of, both, therapist, and, client, in, terms, of, social, skills, coping, efforts, defense, mechanisms, or, deliberate, strategies, and, in, terms, of, moral, judgments, or, the, need, to, consider, underlying, motivations, for, specific, behaviors, or, conflicts, the, vulnerabilities, of, a, client, and, indeed, a, therapist, may, become, lost, behind, actual, or, apparent, strength, and, resilience, it, is, commonly, stated, that, there, is, always, a, need, to, maintain, appropriate, professional, personal, boundaries, while, allowing, for, emotional, expression, and, therapeutic, relationships, however, there, can, be, difficulty, acknowledging, the, different, worlds, and, views, that, both, the, client, and, therapist, may, live, with, a, therapist, may, assume, that, the, kinds, of, relationships, and, ways, of, interacting, that, make, them, feel, safe, and, comfortable, have, the, same, effect, on, clients, as, an, example, of, one, extreme, people, who, may, have, been, exposed, to, hostility, deceptiveness, rejection, aggression, or, abuse, in, their, lives, may, in, some, cases, be, made, confused, intimidated, or, suspicious, by, presentations, of, warmth, intimacy, or, positivity, on, the, other, hand, reassurance, openness, and, clear, communication, are, usually, helpful, and, needed, it, can, take, several, months, of, sessions, and, perhaps, several, stops, and, starts, to, begin, to, develop, a, trusting, relationship, that, can, meaningfully, address, a, client, s, issues, the, prevalence, of, personality, disorder, in, the, general, community, was, largely, unknown, until, surveys, starting, from, the, 1990s, in, 2008, the, median, rate, of, diagnosable, pd, was, estimated, at, 10, 6, based, on, six, major, studies, across, three, nations, this, rate, of, around, one, in, ten, especially, as, associated, with, high, use, of, cocaine, is, described, as, a, major, public, health, concern, requiring, attention, by, researchers, and, clinicians, the, prevalence, of, individual, personality, disorders, ranges, from, about, 2, to, 8, for, the, more, common, varieties, such, as, obsessive, compulsive, schizotypal, antisocial, borderline, and, histrionic, to, 0, 5, 1, for, the, least, common, such, as, narcissistic, and, avoidant, a, screening, survey, across, 13, countries, by, the, world, health, organization, using, dsm, iv, criteria, reported, in, 2009, a, prevalence, estimate, of, around, 6, for, personality, disorders, the, rate, sometimes, varied, with, demographic, and, socioeconomic, factors, and, functional, impairment, was, partly, explained, by, co, occurring, mental, disorders, in, the, us, screening, data, from, the, national, comorbidity, survey, replication, between, 2001, and, 2003, combined, with, interviews, of, a, subset, of, respondents, indicated, a, population, prevalence, of, around, 9, for, personality, disorders, in, total, functional, disability, associated, with, the, diagnoses, appeared, to, be, largely, due, to, co, occurring, mental, disorders, axis, i, in, the, dsm, this, statistic, has, been, supported, by, other, studies, in, the, us, with, overall, global, prevalence, statistics, ranging, from, 9, to, 11, a, uk, national, epidemiological, study, based, on, dsm, iv, screening, criteria, reclassified, into, levels, of, severity, rather, than, just, diagnosis, reported, in, 2010, that, the, majority, of, people, show, some, personality, difficulties, in, one, way, or, another, short, of, threshold, for, diagnosis, while, the, prevalence, of, the, most, complex, and, severe, cases, including, meeting, criteria, for, multiple, diagnoses, in, different, clusters, was, estimated, at, 1, 3, even, low, levels, of, personality, symptoms, were, associated, with, functional, problems, but, the, most, severely, in, need, of, services, was, a, much, smaller, group, personality, disorders, especially, cluster, a, are, found, more, commonly, among, homeless, people, there, are, some, sex, differences, in, the, frequency, of, personality, disorders, which, are, shown, in, the, table, below, 206, the, known, prevalence, of, some, personality, disorders, especially, borderline, pd, and, antisocial, pd, are, affected, by, diagnostic, bias, this, is, due, to, many, factors, including, disproportionately, high, research, towards, borderline, pd, and, antisocial, pd, alongside, social, and, gender, stereotypes, and, the, relationship, between, diagnosis, rates, and, prevalence, rates, since, the, removal, of, depressive, pd, self, defeating, pd, sadistic, pd, and, passive, aggressive, pd, from, the, dsm, 5, studies, analysing, their, prevalence, and, demographics, have, been, limited, introduced, deleted, personality, disorder, is, a, term, with, a, distinctly, modern, meaning, owing, in, part, to, its, clinical, usage, and, the, institutional, character, of, modern, psychiatry, the, currently, accepted, meaning, must, be, understood, in, the, context, of, historical, changing, classification, systems, such, as, dsm, iv, and, its, predecessors, although, highly, anachronistic, and, ignoring, radical, differences, in, the, character, of, subjectivity, and, social, relations, some, have, suggested, similarities, to, other, concepts, going, back, to, at, least, the, ancient, greeks, 35, for, example, the, greek, philosopher, theophrastus, described, 29, character, types, that, he, saw, as, deviations, from, the, norm, and, similar, views, have, been, found, in, asian, arabic, and, celtic, cultures, a, long, standing, influence, in, the, western, world, was, galen, s, concept, of, personality, types, which, he, linked, to, the, four, humours, proposed, by, hippocrates, such, views, lasted, into, the, eighteenth, century, when, experiments, began, to, question, the, supposed, biologically, based, humours, and, temperaments, psychological, concepts, of, character, and, self, became, widespread, in, the, nineteenth, century, personality, referred, to, a, person, s, conscious, awareness, of, their, behavior, a, disorder, of, which, could, be, linked, to, altered, states, such, as, dissociation, this, sense, of, the, term, has, been, compared, to, the, use, of, the, term, multiple, personality, disorder, in, the, first, versions, of, the, dsm, physicians, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, started, to, diagnose, forms, of, insanity, involving, disturbed, emotions, and, behaviors, but, seemingly, without, significant, intellectual, impairment, or, delusions, or, hallucinations, philippe, pinel, referred, to, this, as, manie, sans, d, lire, mania, without, delusions, and, described, a, number, of, cases, mainly, involving, excessive, or, inexplicable, anger, or, rage, james, cowles, prichard, advanced, a, similar, concept, he, called, moral, insanity, which, would, be, used, to, diagnose, patients, for, some, decades, moral, in, this, sense, referred, to, affect, emotion, or, mood, rather, than, simply, the, ethical, dimension, but, it, was, arguably, a, significant, move, for, psychiatric, diagnostic, practice, to, become, so, clearly, engaged, with, judgments, about, individual, s, social, behaviour, prichard, was, influenced, by, his, own, religious, social, and, moral, beliefs, as, well, as, ideas, in, german, psychiatry, these, categories, were, much, different, and, broader, than, later, definitions, of, personality, disorder, while, also, being, developed, by, some, into, a, more, specific, meaning, of, moral, degeneracy, akin, to, later, ideas, about, psychopaths, separately, richard, von, krafft, ebing, popularized, the, terms, sadism, and, masochism, as, well, as, homosexuality, as, psychiatric, issues, the, german, psychiatrist, koch, sought, to, make, the, moral, insanity, concept, more, scientific, and, in, 1891, suggested, the, phrase, psychopathic, inferiority, theorized, to, be, a, congenital, disorder, this, referred, to, continual, and, rigid, patterns, of, misconduct, or, dysfunction, in, the, absence, of, apparent, mental, retardation, or, illness, supposedly, without, a, moral, judgment, described, as, deeply, rooted, in, his, christian, faith, his, work, established, the, concept, of, personality, disorder, as, used, today, in, the, early, 20th, century, another, german, psychiatrist, emil, kraepelin, included, a, chapter, on, psychopathic, inferiority, in, his, influential, work, on, clinical, psychiatry, for, students, and, physicians, he, suggested, six, types, excitable, unstable, eccentric, liar, swindler, and, quarrelsome, the, categories, were, essentially, defined, by, the, most, disordered, criminal, offenders, observed, distinguished, between, criminals, by, impulse, professional, criminals, and, morbid, vagabonds, who, wandered, through, life, kraepelin, also, described, three, paranoid, meaning, then, delusional, disorders, resembling, later, concepts, of, schizophrenia, delusional, disorder, and, paranoid, personality, disorder, a, diagnostic, term, for, the, latter, concept, would, be, included, in, the, dsm, from, 1952, and, from, 1980, the, dsm, would, also, include, schizoid, schizotypal, interpretations, of, earlier, 1921, theories, of, ernst, kretschmer, led, to, a, distinction, between, these, and, another, type, later, included, in, the, dsm, avoidant, personality, disorder, in, 1933, russian, psychiatrist, pyotr, borisovich, gannushkin, published, his, book, manifestations, of, psychopathies, statics, dynamics, systematic, aspects, which, was, one, of, the, first, attempts, to, develop, a, detailed, typology, of, psychopathies, regarding, maladaptation, ubiquity, and, stability, as, the, three, main, symptoms, of, behavioral, pathology, he, distinguished, nine, clusters, of, psychopaths, cycloids, including, constitutionally, depressive, constitutionally, excitable, cyclothymics, and, emotionally, labile, asthenics, including, psychasthenics, schizoids, including, dreamers, paranoiacs, including, fanatics, epileptoids, hysterical, personalities, including, pathological, liars, unstable, psychopaths, antisocial, psychopaths, and, constitutionally, stupid, some, elements, of, gannushkin, s, typology, were, later, incorporated, into, the, theory, developed, by, a, russian, adolescent, psychiatrist, andrey, yevgenyevich, lichko, who, was, also, interested, in, psychopathies, along, with, their, milder, forms, the, so, called, accentuations, of, character, in, 1939, psychiatrist, david, henderson, published, a, theory, of, psychopathic, states, that, contributed, to, popularly, linking, the, term, to, anti, social, behavior, hervey, m, cleckley, s, 1941, text, the, mask, of, sanity, based, on, his, personal, categorization, of, similarities, he, noted, in, some, prisoners, marked, the, start, of, the, modern, clinical, conception, of, psychopathy, and, its, popularist, usage, towards, the, mid, 20th, century, psychoanalytic, theories, were, coming, to, the, fore, based, on, work, from, the, turn, of, the, century, being, popularized, by, sigmund, freud, and, others, this, included, the, concept, of, character, disorders, which, were, seen, as, enduring, problems, linked, not, to, specific, symptoms, but, to, pervasive, internal, conflicts, or, derailments, of, normal, childhood, development, these, were, often, understood, as, weaknesses, of, character, or, willful, deviance, and, were, distinguished, from, neurosis, or, psychosis, the, term, borderline, stems, from, a, belief, some, individuals, were, functioning, on, the, edge, of, those, two, categories, and, a, number, of, the, other, personality, disorder, categories, were, also, heavily, influenced, by, this, approach, including, dependent, obsessive, compulsive, and, histrionic, the, latter, starting, off, as, a, conversion, symptom, of, hysteria, particularly, associated, with, women, then, a, hysterical, personality, then, renamed, histrionic, personality, disorder, in, later, versions, of, the, dsm, a, passive, aggressive, style, was, defined, clinically, by, colonel, william, menninger, during, world, war, ii, in, the, context, of, men, s, reactions, to, military, compliance, which, would, later, be, referenced, as, a, personality, disorder, in, the, dsm, otto, kernberg, was, influential, with, regard, to, the, concepts, of, borderline, and, narcissistic, personalities, later, incorporated, in, 1980, as, disorders, into, the, dsm, meanwhile, a, more, general, personality, psychology, had, been, developing, in, academia, and, to, some, extent, clinically, gordon, allport, published, theories, of, personality, traits, from, the, 1920s, and, henry, murray, advanced, a, theory, called, personology, which, influenced, a, later, key, advocate, of, personality, disorders, theodore, millon, tests, were, developing, or, being, applied, for, personality, evaluation, including, projective, tests, such, as, the, rorschach, test, as, well, as, questionnaires, such, as, the, minnesota, multiphasic, personality, inventory, around, mid, century, hans, eysenck, was, analysing, traits, and, personality, types, and, psychiatrist, kurt, schneider, was, popularising, a, clinical, use, in, place, of, the, previously, more, usual, terms, character, temperament, or, constitution, american, psychiatrists, officially, recognized, concepts, of, enduring, personality, disturbances, in, the, first, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, in, the, 1950s, which, relied, heavily, on, psychoanalytic, concepts, somewhat, more, neutral, language, was, employed, in, the, dsm, ii, in, 1968, though, the, terms, and, descriptions, had, only, a, slight, resemblance, to, current, definitions, the, dsm, iii, published, in, 1980, made, some, major, changes, notably, putting, all, personality, disorders, onto, a, second, separate, axis, along, with, mental, retardation, intended, to, signify, more, enduring, patterns, distinct, from, what, were, considered, axis, one, mental, disorders, inadequate, and, asthenic, personality, disorder, categories, were, deleted, and, others, were, expanded, into, more, types, or, changed, from, being, personality, disorders, to, regular, disorders, sociopathic, personality, disorder, which, had, been, the, term, for, psychopathy, was, renamed, antisocial, personality, disorder, most, categories, were, given, more, specific, operationalized, definitions, with, standard, criteria, psychiatrists, could, agree, on, to, conduct, research, and, diagnose, patients, in, the, dsm, iii, revision, self, defeating, personality, disorder, and, sadistic, personality, disorder, were, included, as, provisional, diagnoses, requiring, further, study, they, were, dropped, in, the, dsm, iv, though, a, proposed, depressive, personality, disorder, was, added, in, addition, the, official, diagnosis, of, passive, aggressive, personality, disorder, was, dropped, tentatively, renamed, negativistic, personality, disorder, international, differences, have, been, noted, in, how, attitudes, have, developed, towards, the, diagnosis, of, personality, disorder, kurt, schneider, argued, they, were, abnormal, varieties, of, psychic, life, and, therefore, not, necessarily, the, domain, of, psychiatry, a, view, said, to, still, have, influence, in, germany, today, british, psychiatrists, have, also, been, reluctant, to, address, such, disorders, or, consider, them, on, par, with, other, mental, disorders, which, has, been, attributed, partly, to, resource, pressures, within, the, national, health, service, as, well, as, to, negative, medical, attitudes, towards, behaviors, associated, with, personality, disorders, in, the, us, the, prevailing, healthcare, system, and, psychoanalytic, tradition, has, been, said, to, provide, a, rationale, for, private, therapists, to, diagnose, some, personality, disorders, more, broadly, and, provide, ongoing, treatment, for, them
