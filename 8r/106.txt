a, fingerprint, is, an, impression, left, by, the, friction, ridges, of, a, human, finger, the, recovery, of, partial, fingerprints, from, a, crime, scene, is, an, important, method, of, forensic, science, moisture, and, grease, on, a, finger, result, in, fingerprints, on, surfaces, such, as, glass, or, metal, deliberate, impressions, of, entire, fingerprints, can, be, obtained, by, ink, or, other, substances, transferred, from, the, peaks, of, friction, ridges, on, the, skin, to, a, smooth, surface, such, as, paper, fingerprint, records, normally, contain, impressions, from, the, pad, on, the, last, joint, of, fingers, and, thumbs, though, fingerprint, cards, also, typically, record, portions, of, lower, joint, areas, of, the, fingers, human, fingerprints, are, detailed, unique, difficult, to, alter, and, durable, over, the, life, of, an, individual, making, them, suitable, as, long, term, markers, of, human, identity, they, may, be, employed, by, police, or, other, authorities, to, identify, individuals, who, wish, to, conceal, their, identity, or, to, identify, people, who, are, incapacitated, or, deceased, and, thus, unable, to, identify, themselves, as, in, the, aftermath, of, a, natural, disaster, their, use, as, evidence, has, been, challenged, by, academics, judges, and, the, media, there, are, no, uniform, standards, for, point, counting, methods, and, academics, have, argued, that, the, error, rate, in, matching, fingerprints, has, not, been, adequately, studied, and, that, fingerprint, evidence, has, no, secure, statistical, foundation, research, has, been, conducted, into, whether, experts, can, objectively, focus, on, feature, information, in, fingerprints, without, being, misled, by, extraneous, information, such, as, context, fingerprints, are, impressions, left, on, surfaces, by, the, friction, ridges, on, the, finger, of, a, human, the, matching, of, two, fingerprints, is, among, the, most, widely, used, and, most, reliable, biometric, techniques, fingerprint, matching, considers, only, the, obvious, features, of, a, fingerprint, the, composition, of, fingerprints, consists, of, water, 95, 99, as, well, as, organic, and, inorganic, constituents, the, organic, component, is, made, up, of, amino, acids, proteins, glucose, lactase, urea, pyruvate, fatty, acids, and, sterols, inorganic, ions, such, as, chloride, sodium, potassium, and, iron, are, also, present, other, contaminants, such, as, oils, found, in, cosmetics, drugs, and, their, metabolites, and, food, residues, may, be, found, in, fingerprint, residues, a, friction, ridge, is, a, raised, portion, of, the, epidermis, on, the, digits, fingers, and, toes, the, palm, of, the, hand, or, the, sole, of, the, foot, consisting, of, one, or, more, connected, ridge, units, of, friction, ridge, skin, these, are, sometimes, known, as, epidermal, ridges, which, are, caused, by, the, underlying, interface, between, the, dermal, papillae, of, the, dermis, and, the, interpapillary, rete, pegs, of, the, epidermis, these, unique, features, are, formed, at, around, the, 15th, week, of, fetal, development, and, remain, until, after, death, when, decomposition, begins, during, the, development, of, the, fetus, around, the, 13th, week, of, a, pregnancy, ledge, like, formation, is, formed, at, the, bottom, of, the, epidermis, beside, the, dermis, the, cells, along, these, ledges, begin, to, rapidly, proliferate, this, rapid, proliferation, forms, primary, and, secondary, ridges, both, the, primary, and, secondary, ridges, act, as, a, template, for, the, outer, layer, of, the, skin, to, form, the, friction, ridges, seen, on, the, surface, of, the, skin, these, epidermal, ridges, serve, to, amplify, vibrations, triggered, for, example, when, fingertips, brush, across, an, uneven, surface, better, transmitting, the, signals, to, sensory, nerves, involved, in, fine, texture, perception, these, ridges, may, also, assist, in, gripping, rough, surfaces, and, may, improve, surface, contact, in, wet, conditions, consensus, within, the, scientific, community, suggests, that, the, dermatoglyphic, patterns, on, fingertips, are, hereditary, the, fingerprint, patterns, between, monozygotic, twins, have, been, shown, to, be, very, similar, though, not, identical, whereas, dizygotic, twins, have, considerably, less, similarity, significant, heritability, has, been, identified, for, 12, dermatoglyphic, characteristics, current, models, of, dermatoglyphic, trait, inheritance, suggest, mendelian, transmission, with, additional, effects, from, either, additive, or, dominant, major, genes, whereas, genes, determine, the, general, characteristics, of, patterns, and, their, type, the, presence, of, environmental, factors, result, in, the, slight, differentiation, of, each, fingerprint, however, the, relative, influences, of, genetic, and, environmental, effects, on, fingerprint, patterns, are, generally, unclear, one, study, has, suggested, that, roughly, 5, of, the, total, variability, is, due, to, small, environmental, effects, although, this, was, only, performed, using, total, ridge, count, as, a, metric, several, models, of, finger, ridge, formation, mechanisms, that, lead, to, the, vast, diversity, of, fingerprints, have, been, proposed, one, model, suggests, that, a, buckling, instability, in, the, basal, cell, layer, of, the, fetal, epidermis, is, responsible, for, developing, epidermal, ridges, additionally, blood, vessels, and, nerves, may, also, serve, a, role, in, the, formation, of, ridge, configurations, another, model, indicates, that, changes, in, amniotic, fluid, surrounding, each, developing, finger, within, the, uterus, cause, corresponding, cells, on, each, fingerprint, to, grow, in, different, microenvironments, for, a, given, individual, these, various, factors, affect, each, finger, differently, preventing, two, fingerprints, from, being, identical, while, still, retaining, similar, patterns, it, is, important, to, note, that, the, determination, of, fingerprint, inheritance, is, made, difficult, by, the, vast, diversity, of, phenotypes, classification, of, a, specific, pattern, is, often, subjective, lack, of, consensus, on, the, most, appropriate, characteristic, to, measure, quantitatively, which, complicates, analysis, of, dermatoglyphic, patterns, several, modes, of, inheritance, have, been, suggested, and, observed, for, various, fingerprint, patterns, total, fingerprint, ridge, count, a, commonly, used, metric, of, fingerprint, pattern, size, has, been, suggested, to, have, a, polygenic, mode, of, inheritance, and, is, influenced, by, multiple, additive, genes, this, hypothesis, has, been, challenged, by, other, research, however, which, indicates, that, ridge, counts, on, individual, fingers, are, genetically, independent, and, lack, evidence, to, support, the, existence, of, additive, genes, influencing, pattern, formation, another, mode, of, fingerprint, pattern, inheritance, suggests, that, the, arch, pattern, on, the, thumb, and, on, other, fingers, are, inherited, as, an, autosomal, dominant, trait, further, research, on, the, arch, pattern, has, suggested, that, a, major, gene, or, multifactorial, inheritance, is, responsible, for, arch, pattern, heritability, a, separate, model, for, the, development, of, the, whorl, pattern, indicates, that, a, single, gene, or, group, of, linked, genes, contributes, to, its, inheritance, furthermore, inheritance, of, the, whorl, pattern, does, not, appear, to, be, symmetric, in, that, the, pattern, is, seemingly, randomly, distributed, among, the, ten, fingers, of, a, given, individual, in, general, comparison, of, fingerprint, patterns, between, left, and, right, hands, suggests, an, asymmetry, in, the, effects, of, genes, on, fingerprint, patterns, although, this, observation, requires, further, analysis, in, addition, to, proposed, models, of, inheritance, specific, genes, have, been, implicated, as, factors, in, fingertip, pattern, formation, their, exact, mechanism, of, influencing, patterns, is, still, under, research, multivariate, linkage, analysis, of, finger, ridge, counts, on, individual, fingers, revealed, linkage, to, chromosome, 5q14, 1, specifically, for, the, ring, index, and, middle, fingers, in, mice, variants, in, the, gene, evi1, were, correlated, with, dermatoglyphic, patterns, evi1, expression, in, humans, does, not, directly, influence, fingerprint, patterns, but, does, affect, limb, and, digit, formation, which, in, turn, may, play, a, role, in, influencing, fingerprint, patterns, genome, wide, association, studies, found, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, within, the, gene, adamts9, as2, on, 3p14, 1, which, appeared, to, have, an, influence, on, the, whorl, pattern, on, all, digits, this, gene, encodes, antisense, rna, which, may, inhibit, adamts9, which, is, expressed, in, the, skin, a, model, of, how, genetic, variants, of, adamts9, as2, directly, influence, whorl, development, has, not, yet, been, proposed, in, february, 2023, a, study, identified, wnt, bmp, and, edar, as, signaling, pathways, regulating, the, formation, of, primary, ridges, on, fingerprints, with, the, first, two, having, an, opposite, relationship, established, by, a, turing, reaction, diffusion, system, before, computerization, manual, filing, systems, were, used, in, large, fingerprint, repositories, a, fingerprint, classification, system, groups, fingerprints, according, to, their, characteristics, and, therefore, helps, in, the, matching, of, a, fingerprint, against, a, large, database, of, fingerprints, a, query, fingerprint, that, needs, to, be, matched, can, therefore, be, compared, with, a, subset, of, fingerprints, in, an, existing, database, early, classification, systems, were, based, on, the, general, ridge, patterns, including, the, presence, or, absence, of, circular, patterns, of, several, or, all, fingers, this, allowed, the, filing, and, retrieval, of, paper, records, in, large, collections, based, on, friction, ridge, patterns, alone, the, most, popular, systems, used, the, pattern, class, of, each, finger, to, form, a, numeric, key, to, assist, lookup, in, a, filing, system, fingerprint, classification, systems, included, the, roscher, system, the, juan, vucetich, system, and, the, henry, classification, system, the, roscher, system, was, developed, in, germany, and, implemented, in, both, germany, and, japan, the, vucetich, system, was, developed, in, argentina, and, implemented, throughout, south, america, the, henry, classification, system, was, developed, in, india, and, implemented, in, most, english, speaking, countries, in, the, henry, classification, system, there, are, three, basic, fingerprint, patterns, loop, whorl, and, arch, which, constitute, 60, 65, percent, 30, 35, percent, and, 5, percent, of, all, fingerprints, respectively, there, are, also, more, complex, classification, systems, that, break, down, patterns, even, further, into, plain, arches, or, tented, arches, and, into, loops, that, may, be, radial, or, ulnar, depending, on, the, side, of, the, hand, toward, which, the, tail, points, ulnar, loops, start, on, the, pinky, side, of, the, finger, the, side, closer, to, the, ulna, the, lower, arm, bone, radial, loops, start, on, the, thumb, side, of, the, finger, the, side, closer, to, the, radius, whorls, may, also, have, sub, group, classifications, including, plain, whorls, accidental, whorls, double, loop, whorls, peacock, s, eye, composite, and, central, pocket, loop, whorls, the, primary, classification, number, in, the, henry, classification, system, is, a, fraction, whose, numerator, and, denominator, are, whole, numbers, between, 1, and, 32, inclusive, thus, classifying, each, set, of, ten, fingerprints, into, one, of, 1024, groups, to, distinguish, these, groups, the, fraction, is, not, reduced, by, dividing, out, any, common, factors, the, fraction, is, determined, by, ten, indicators, one, for, each, finger, an, indicator, taking, the, value, 1, when, that, finger, has, a, whorl, and, 0, otherwise, these, indicators, can, be, written, r, t, r, i, r, m, r, r, r, l, displaystyle, r, t, r, i, r, m, r, r, r, l, for, the, right, hand, and, l, t, l, i, l, m, l, r, l, l, displaystyle, l, t, l, i, l, m, l, r, l, l, for, the, left, hand, where, the, subscripts, are, t, for, thumb, i, for, index, finger, m, for, middle, finger, r, for, ring, finger, and, l, for, little, finger, the, formula, for, the, fraction, is, then, as, follows, 16, r, i, 8, r, r, 4, l, t, 2, l, m, 1, l, l, 1, 16, r, t, 8, r, m, 4, r, l, 2, l, i, 1, l, r, 1, displaystyle, 16r, i, 8r, r, 4l, t, 2l, m, 1l, l, 1, over, 16r, t, 8r, m, 4r, l, 2l, i, 1l, r, 1, for, example, if, only, the, right, ring, finger, and, the, left, index, finger, have, whorls, then, the, set, of, fingerprints, is, classified, into, the, 9, 3, group, 16, 0, 8, 1, 4, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, 16, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 9, 3, displaystyle, 16, 0, 8, 1, 4, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1, over, 16, 0, 8, 0, 4, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 9, over, 3, note, that, although, 9, 3, 3, 1, the, 9, 3, group, is, different, from, the, 3, 1, group, as, the, latter, corresponds, to, having, whorls, only, on, the, left, middle, finger, fingerprint, identification, known, as, dactyloscopy, ridgeology, or, hand, print, identification, is, the, process, of, comparing, two, instances, of, friction, ridge, skin, impressions, see, minutiae, from, human, fingers, or, toes, or, even, the, palm, of, the, hand, or, sole, of, the, foot, to, determine, whether, these, impressions, could, have, come, from, the, same, individual, the, flexibility, and, the, randomized, formation, of, the, friction, ridges, on, skin, means, that, no, two, finger, or, palm, prints, are, ever, exactly, alike, in, every, detail, even, two, impressions, recorded, immediately, after, each, other, from, the, same, hand, may, be, slightly, different, fingerprint, identification, also, referred, to, as, individualization, involves, an, expert, or, an, expert, computer, system, operating, under, threshold, scoring, rules, determining, whether, two, friction, ridge, impressions, are, likely, to, have, originated, from, the, same, finger, or, palm, or, toe, or, sole, in, 2024, research, using, deep, learning, neural, networks, found, contrary, to, prevailing, assumptions, that, fingerprints, from, different, fingers, of, the, same, person, could, be, identified, as, belonging, to, that, individual, with, 99, 99, confidence, further, features, used, in, traditional, methods, were, nonpredictive, in, such, identification, while, ridge, orientation, particularly, near, the, center, of, the, fingerprint, center, provided, most, information, an, intentional, recording, of, friction, ridges, is, usually, made, with, black, printer, s, ink, rolled, across, a, contrasting, white, background, typically, a, white, card, friction, ridges, can, also, be, recorded, digitally, usually, on, a, glass, plate, using, a, technique, called, live, scan, a, latent, print, is, the, chance, recording, of, friction, ridges, deposited, on, the, surface, of, an, object, or, a, wall, latent, prints, are, invisible, to, the, naked, eye, whereas, patent, prints, or, plastic, prints, are, viewable, with, the, unaided, eye, latent, prints, are, often, fragmentary, and, require, the, use, of, chemical, methods, powder, or, alternative, light, sources, in, order, to, be, made, clear, sometimes, an, ordinary, bright, flashlight, will, make, a, latent, print, visible, when, friction, ridges, come, into, contact, with, a, surface, that, will, take, a, print, material, that, is, on, the, friction, ridges, such, as, perspiration, oil, grease, ink, or, blood, will, be, transferred, to, the, surface, factors, which, affect, the, quality, of, friction, ridge, impressions, are, numerous, pliability, of, the, skin, deposition, pressure, slippage, the, material, from, which, the, surface, is, made, the, roughness, of, the, surface, and, the, substance, deposited, are, just, some, of, the, various, factors, which, can, cause, a, latent, print, to, appear, differently, from, any, known, recording, of, the, same, friction, ridges, indeed, the, conditions, surrounding, every, instance, of, friction, ridge, deposition, are, unique, and, never, duplicated, for, these, reasons, fingerprint, examiners, are, required, to, undergo, extensive, training, the, scientific, study, of, fingerprints, is, called, dermatoglyphics, exemplar, prints, or, known, prints, is, the, name, given, to, fingerprints, deliberately, collected, from, a, subject, whether, for, purposes, of, enrollment, in, a, system, or, when, under, arrest, for, a, suspected, criminal, offense, during, criminal, arrests, a, set, of, exemplar, prints, will, normally, include, one, print, taken, from, each, finger, that, has, been, rolled, from, one, edge, of, the, nail, to, the, other, plain, or, slap, impressions, of, each, of, the, four, fingers, of, each, hand, and, plain, impressions, of, each, thumb, exemplar, prints, can, be, collected, using, live, scan, or, by, using, ink, on, paper, cards, in, forensic, science, a, partial, fingerprint, lifted, from, a, surface, is, called, a, latent, fingerprint, moisture, and, grease, on, fingers, result, in, latent, fingerprints, on, surfaces, such, as, glass, but, because, they, are, not, clearly, visible, their, detection, may, require, chemical, development, through, powder, dusting, the, spraying, of, ninhydrin, iodine, fuming, or, soaking, in, silver, nitrate, depending, on, the, surface, or, the, material, on, which, a, latent, fingerprint, has, been, found, different, methods, of, chemical, development, must, be, used, forensic, scientists, use, different, techniques, for, porous, surfaces, such, as, paper, and, nonporous, surfaces, such, as, glass, metal, or, plastic, nonporous, surfaces, require, the, dusting, process, where, fine, powder, and, a, brush, are, used, followed, by, the, application, of, transparent, tape, to, lift, the, latent, fingerprint, off, the, surface, while, the, police, often, describe, all, partial, fingerprints, found, at, a, crime, scene, as, latent, prints, forensic, scientists, call, partial, fingerprints, that, are, readily, visible, patent, prints, chocolate, toner, paint, or, ink, on, fingers, will, result, in, patent, fingerprints, latent, fingerprints, impressions, that, are, found, on, soft, material, such, as, soap, cement, or, plaster, are, called, plastic, prints, by, forensic, scientists, fingerprint, image, acquisition, is, considered, to, be, the, most, critical, step, in, an, automated, fingerprint, authentication, system, as, it, determines, the, final, fingerprint, image, quality, which, has, a, drastic, effect, on, the, overall, system, performance, there, are, different, types, of, fingerprint, readers, on, the, market, but, the, basic, idea, behind, each, is, to, measure, the, physical, difference, between, ridges, and, valleys, all, the, proposed, methods, can, be, grouped, into, two, major, families, solid, state, fingerprint, readers, and, optical, fingerprint, readers, the, procedure, for, capturing, a, fingerprint, using, a, sensor, consists, of, rolling, or, touching, with, the, finger, onto, a, sensing, area, which, according, to, the, physical, principle, in, use, optical, ultrasonic, capacitive, or, thermal, see, fingerprint, sensors, captures, the, difference, between, valleys, and, ridges, when, a, finger, touches, or, rolls, onto, a, surface, the, elastic, skin, deforms, the, quantity, and, direction, of, the, pressure, applied, by, the, user, the, skin, conditions, and, the, projection, of, an, irregular, 3d, object, the, finger, onto, a, 2d, flat, plane, introduce, distortions, noise, and, inconsistencies, in, the, captured, fingerprint, image, these, problems, result, in, inconsistent, and, non, uniform, irregularities, in, the, image, during, each, acquisition, therefore, the, results, of, the, imaging, are, different, and, uncontrollable, the, representation, of, the, same, fingerprint, changes, every, time, the, finger, is, placed, on, the, sensor, plate, increasing, the, complexity, of, any, attempt, to, match, fingerprints, impairing, the, system, performance, and, consequently, limiting, the, widespread, use, of, this, biometric, technology, in, order, to, overcome, these, problems, as, of, 2010, non, contact, or, touchless, 3d, fingerprint, scanners, have, been, developed, acquiring, detailed, 3d, information, 3d, fingerprint, scanners, take, a, digital, approach, to, the, analog, process, of, pressing, or, rolling, the, finger, by, modelling, the, distance, between, neighboring, points, the, fingerprint, can, be, imaged, at, a, resolution, high, enough, to, record, all, the, necessary, detail, the, human, skin, itself, which, is, a, regenerating, organ, until, death, and, environmental, factors, such, as, lotions, and, cosmetics, pose, challenges, when, fingerprinting, a, human, following, the, death, of, a, human, the, skin, dries, and, cools, fingerprints, of, dead, humans, may, be, obtained, during, an, autopsy, the, collection, of, fingerprints, off, of, a, cadaver, can, be, done, in, varying, ways, and, depends, on, the, condition, of, the, skin, in, the, case, of, cadaver, in, the, later, stages, of, decomposition, with, dried, skin, analysts, will, boil, the, skin, to, recondition, rehydrate, it, allowing, for, moisture, to, flow, back, into, the, skin, and, resulting, in, detail, friction, ridges, another, method, that, has, been, used, in, brushing, a, powder, such, as, baby, powder, over, the, tips, of, the, fingers, the, powder, will, ebbed, itself, into, the, farrows, of, the, friction, ridges, allowing, for, the, lifted, ridges, to, be, seen, in, the, 1930s, criminal, investigators, in, the, united, states, first, discovered, the, existence, of, latent, fingerprints, on, the, surfaces, of, fabrics, most, notably, on, the, insides, of, gloves, discarded, by, perpetrators, since, the, late, nineteenth, century, fingerprint, identification, methods, have, been, used, by, police, agencies, around, the, world, to, identify, suspected, criminals, as, well, as, the, victims, of, crime, the, basis, of, the, traditional, fingerprinting, technique, is, simple, the, skin, on, the, palmar, surface, of, the, hands, and, feet, forms, ridges, so, called, papillary, ridges, in, patterns, that, are, unique, to, each, individual, and, which, do, not, change, over, time, even, identical, twins, who, share, their, dna, do, not, have, identical, fingerprints, the, best, way, to, render, latent, fingerprints, visible, so, that, they, can, be, photographed, can, be, complex, and, may, depend, for, example, on, the, type, of, surfaces, on, which, they, have, been, left, it, is, generally, necessary, to, use, a, developer, usually, a, powder, or, chemical, reagent, to, produce, a, high, degree, of, visual, contrast, between, the, ridge, patterns, and, the, surface, on, which, a, fingerprint, has, been, deposited, developing, agents, depend, on, the, presence, of, organic, materials, or, inorganic, salts, for, their, effectiveness, although, the, water, deposited, may, also, take, a, key, role, fingerprints, are, typically, formed, from, the, aqueous, based, secretions, of, the, eccrine, glands, of, the, fingers, and, palms, with, additional, material, from, sebaceous, glands, primarily, from, the, forehead, this, latter, contamination, results, from, the, common, human, behaviors, of, touching, the, face, and, hair, the, resulting, latent, fingerprints, consist, usually, of, a, substantial, proportion, of, water, with, small, traces, of, amino, acids, and, chlorides, mixed, with, a, fatty, sebaceous, component, which, contains, a, number, of, fatty, acids, and, triglycerides, detection, of, a, small, proportion, of, reactive, organic, substances, such, as, urea, and, amino, acids, is, far, from, easy, fingerprints, at, a, crime, scene, may, be, detected, by, simple, powders, or, by, chemicals, applied, in, situ, more, complex, techniques, usually, involving, chemicals, can, be, applied, in, specialist, laboratories, to, appropriate, articles, removed, from, a, crime, scene, with, advances, in, these, more, sophisticated, techniques, some, of, the, more, advanced, crime, scene, investigation, services, from, around, the, world, were, as, of, 2010, reporting, that, 50, or, more, of, the, fingerprints, recovered, from, a, crime, scene, had, been, identified, as, a, result, of, laboratory, based, techniques, although, there, are, hundreds, of, reported, techniques, for, fingerprint, detection, many, of, these, are, only, of, academic, interest, and, there, are, only, around, 20, really, effective, methods, which, are, currently, in, use, in, the, more, advanced, fingerprint, laboratories, around, the, world, some, of, these, techniques, such, as, ninhydrin, diazafluorenone, and, vacuum, metal, deposition, show, great, sensitivity, and, are, used, operationally, some, fingerprint, reagents, are, specific, for, example, ninhydrin, or, diazafluorenone, reacting, with, amino, acids, others, such, as, ethyl, cyanoacrylate, polymerisation, work, apparently, by, water, based, catalysis, and, polymer, growth, vacuum, metal, deposition, using, gold, and, zinc, has, been, shown, to, be, non, specific, but, can, detect, fat, layers, as, thin, as, one, molecule, more, mundane, methods, such, as, the, application, of, fine, powders, work, by, adhesion, to, sebaceous, deposits, and, possibly, aqueous, deposits, in, the, case, of, fresh, fingerprints, the, aqueous, component, of, a, fingerprint, while, initially, sometimes, making, up, over, 90, of, the, weight, of, the, fingerprint, can, evaporate, quite, quickly, and, may, have, mostly, gone, after, 24, hours, following, work, on, the, use, of, argon, ion, lasers, for, fingerprint, detection, a, wide, range, of, fluorescence, techniques, have, been, introduced, primarily, for, the, enhancement, of, chemically, developed, fingerprints, the, inherent, fluorescence, of, some, latent, fingerprints, may, also, be, detected, fingerprints, can, for, example, be, visualized, in, 3d, and, without, chemicals, by, the, use, of, infrared, lasers, a, comprehensive, manual, of, the, operational, methods, of, fingerprint, enhancement, was, last, published, by, the, uk, home, office, scientific, development, branch, in, 2013, and, is, used, widely, around, the, world, a, technique, proposed, in, 2007, aims, to, identify, an, individual, s, ethnicity, sex, and, dietary, patterns, one, of, the, main, limitations, of, friction, ridge, impression, evidence, regarding, the, actual, collection, would, be, the, surface, environment, specifically, talking, about, how, porous, the, surface, the, impression, is, on, with, non, porous, surfaces, the, residues, of, the, impression, will, not, be, absorbed, into, the, material, of, the, surface, but, could, be, smudged, by, another, surface, with, porous, surfaces, the, residues, of, the, impression, will, be, absorbed, into, the, surface, with, both, resulting, in, either, an, impression, of, no, value, to, examiners, or, the, destruction, of, the, friction, ridge, impressions, in, order, for, analysts, to, correctly, positively, identify, friction, ridge, patterns, and, their, features, depends, heavily, on, the, clarity, of, the, impression, therefore, the, analysis, of, friction, ridges, is, limited, by, clarity, in, a, court, context, many, have, argued, that, friction, ridge, identification, and, ridgeology, should, be, classified, as, opinion, evidence, and, not, as, fact, therefore, should, be, assessed, as, such, many, have, said, that, friction, ridge, identification, is, only, legally, admissible, today, because, during, the, time, when, it, was, added, to, the, legal, system, the, admissibility, standards, were, quite, low, there, are, only, a, limited, number, of, studies, that, have, been, conducted, to, help, confirm, the, science, behind, this, identification, process, the, application, of, the, new, scanning, kelvin, probe, skp, fingerprinting, technique, which, makes, no, physical, contact, with, the, fingerprint, and, does, not, require, the, use, of, developers, has, the, potential, to, allow, fingerprints, to, be, recorded, while, still, leaving, intact, material, that, could, subsequently, be, subjected, to, dna, analysis, a, forensically, usable, prototype, was, under, development, at, swansea, university, during, 2010, in, research, that, was, generating, significant, interest, from, the, british, home, office, and, a, number, of, different, police, forces, across, the, uk, as, well, as, internationally, the, hope, is, that, this, instrument, could, eventually, be, manufactured, in, sufficiently, large, numbers, to, be, widely, used, by, forensic, teams, worldwide, the, secretions, skin, oils, and, dead, cells, in, a, human, fingerprint, contain, residues, of, various, chemicals, and, their, metabolites, present, in, the, body, these, can, be, detected, and, used, for, forensic, purposes, for, example, the, fingerprints, of, tobacco, smokers, contain, traces, of, cotinine, a, nicotine, metabolite, they, also, contain, traces, of, nicotine, itself, caution, should, be, used, as, its, presence, may, be, caused, by, mere, contact, of, the, finger, with, a, tobacco, product, by, treating, the, fingerprint, with, gold, nanoparticles, with, attached, cotinine, antibodies, and, then, subsequently, with, a, fluorescent, agent, attached, to, cotinine, antibodies, the, fingerprint, of, a, smoker, becomes, fluorescent, non, smokers, fingerprints, stay, dark, the, same, approach, as, of, 2010, is, being, tested, for, use, in, identifying, heavy, coffee, drinkers, cannabis, smokers, and, users, of, various, other, drugs, most, american, law, enforcement, agencies, use, wavelet, scalar, quantization, wsq, a, wavelet, based, system, for, efficient, storage, of, compressed, fingerprint, images, at, 500, pixels, per, inch, ppi, wsq, was, developed, by, the, fbi, the, los, alamos, national, lab, and, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, for, fingerprints, recorded, at, 1000, ppi, spatial, resolution, law, enforcement, including, the, fbi, uses, jpeg, 2000, instead, of, wsq, fingerprints, collected, at, a, crime, scene, or, on, items, of, evidence, from, a, crime, have, been, used, in, forensic, science, to, identify, suspects, victims, and, other, persons, who, touched, a, surface, fingerprint, identification, emerged, as, an, important, system, within, police, agencies, in, the, late, 19th, century, when, it, replaced, anthropometric, measurements, as, a, more, reliable, method, for, identifying, persons, having, a, prior, record, often, under, a, false, name, in, a, criminal, record, repository, fingerprinting, has, served, all, governments, worldwide, during, the, past, 100, years, or, so, to, provide, identification, of, criminals, fingerprints, are, the, fundamental, tool, in, every, police, agency, for, the, identification, of, people, with, a, criminal, history, the, validity, of, forensic, fingerprint, evidence, has, been, challenged, by, academics, judges, and, the, media, in, the, united, states, fingerprint, examiners, have, not, developed, uniform, standards, for, the, identification, of, an, individual, based, on, matching, fingerprints, in, some, countries, where, fingerprints, are, also, used, in, criminal, investigations, fingerprint, examiners, are, required, to, match, a, number, of, identification, points, before, a, match, is, accepted, in, england, 16, identification, points, are, required, and, in, france, 12, to, match, two, fingerprints, and, identify, an, individual, point, counting, methods, have, been, challenged, by, some, fingerprint, examiners, because, they, focus, solely, on, the, location, of, particular, characteristics, in, fingerprints, that, are, to, be, matched, fingerprint, examiners, may, also, uphold, the, one, dissimilarity, doctrine, which, holds, that, if, there, is, one, dissimilarity, between, two, fingerprints, the, fingerprints, are, not, from, the, same, finger, furthermore, academics, have, argued, that, the, error, rate, in, matching, fingerprints, has, not, been, adequately, studied, and, it, has, even, been, argued, that, fingerprint, evidence, has, no, secure, statistical, foundation, research, has, been, conducted, into, whether, experts, can, objectively, focus, on, feature, information, in, fingerprints, without, being, misled, by, extraneous, information, such, as, context, fingerprints, can, theoretically, be, forged, and, planted, at, crime, scenes, fingerprinting, was, the, basis, upon, which, the, first, forensic, professional, organization, was, formed, the, international, association, for, identification, iai, in, 1915, the, first, professional, certification, program, for, forensic, scientists, was, established, in, 1977, the, iai, s, certified, latent, print, examiner, program, which, issued, certificates, to, those, meeting, stringent, criteria, and, had, the, power, to, revoke, certification, where, an, individual, s, performance, warranted, it, other, forensic, disciplines, have, followed, suit, and, established, their, own, certification, programs, fingerprints, have, been, found, on, ancient, clay, tablets, seals, and, pottery, they, have, also, been, found, on, the, walls, of, egyptian, tombs, and, on, minoan, greek, and, chinese, pottery, in, ancient, china, officials, authenticated, government, documents, with, their, fingerprints, in, about, 200, bc, fingerprints, were, used, to, sign, written, contracts, in, babylon, fingerprints, from, 3d, scans, of, cuneiform, tablets, are, extracted, using, the, gigamesh, software, framework, with, the, advent, of, silk, and, paper, in, china, parties, to, a, legal, contract, impressed, their, handprints, on, the, document, sometime, before, 851, ce, an, arab, merchant, in, china, abu, zayd, hasan, witnessed, chinese, merchants, using, fingerprints, to, authenticate, loans, references, from, the, age, of, the, babylonian, king, hammurabi, reigned, 1792, 1750, bce, indicate, that, law, officials, would, take, the, fingerprints, of, people, who, had, been, arrested, during, china, s, qin, dynasty, records, have, shown, that, officials, took, hand, prints, and, foot, prints, as, well, as, fingerprints, as, evidence, from, a, crime, scene, in, 650, the, chinese, historian, kia, kung, yen, remarked, that, fingerprints, could, be, used, as, a, means, of, authentication, in, his, jami, al, tawarikh, universal, history, the, iranian, physician, rashid, al, din, hamadani, 1247, 1318, refers, to, the, chinese, practice, of, identifying, people, via, their, fingerprints, commenting, experience, shows, that, no, two, individuals, have, fingers, exactly, alike, whether, these, examples, indicate, that, ancient, peoples, realized, that, fingerprints, could, uniquely, identify, individuals, has, been, debated, with, some, arguing, these, examples, are, no, more, meaningful, than, an, illiterate, s, mark, on, a, document, or, an, accidental, remnant, akin, to, a, potter, s, mark, on, their, clay, from, the, late, 16th, century, onwards, european, academics, attempted, to, include, fingerprints, in, scientific, studies, but, plausible, conclusions, could, be, established, only, from, the, mid, 17th, century, onwards, in, 1686, the, professor, of, anatomy, at, the, university, of, bologna, marcello, malpighi, identified, ridges, spirals, and, loops, in, fingerprints, left, on, surfaces, in, 1788, a, german, anatomist, johann, christoph, andreas, mayer, was, the, first, european, to, conclude, that, fingerprints, were, unique, to, each, individual, in, 1823, jan, evangelista, purkyn, identified, nine, fingerprint, patterns, the, nine, patterns, include, the, tented, arch, the, loop, and, the, whorl, which, in, modern, day, forensics, are, considered, ridge, details, in, 1840, following, the, murder, of, lord, william, russell, a, provincial, doctor, robert, blake, overton, wrote, to, scotland, yard, suggesting, checking, for, fingerprints, in, 1853, the, german, anatomist, georg, von, meissner, 1829, 1905, studied, friction, ridges, and, in, 1858, sir, william, james, herschel, initiated, fingerprinting, in, india, in, 1877, he, first, instituted, the, use, of, fingerprints, on, contracts, and, deeds, to, prevent, the, repudiation, of, signatures, in, hooghly, near, kolkata, and, he, registered, government, pensioners, fingerprints, to, prevent, the, collection, of, money, by, relatives, after, a, pensioner, s, death, in, 1880, henry, faulds, a, scottish, surgeon, in, a, tokyo, hospital, published, his, first, paper, on, the, usefulness, of, fingerprints, for, identification, and, proposed, a, method, to, record, them, with, printing, ink, henry, faulds, also, suggested, based, on, his, studies, that, fingerprints, are, unique, to, a, human, returning, to, great, britain, in, 1886, he, offered, the, concept, to, the, metropolitan, police, in, london, but, it, was, dismissed, at, that, time, up, until, the, early, 1890s, police, forces, in, the, united, states, and, on, the, european, continent, could, not, reliably, identify, criminals, to, track, their, criminal, record, francis, galton, published, a, detailed, statistical, model, of, fingerprint, analysis, and, identification, in, his, 1892, book, finger, prints, he, had, calculated, that, the, chance, of, a, false, positive, two, different, individuals, having, the, same, fingerprints, was, about, 1, in, 64, billion, in, 1892, juan, vucetich, an, argentine, chief, police, officer, created, the, first, method, of, recording, the, fingerprints, of, individuals, on, file, in, that, same, year, francisca, rojas, was, found, in, a, house, with, neck, injuries, while, her, two, sons, were, found, dead, with, their, throats, cut, rojas, accused, a, neighbour, but, despite, brutal, interrogation, this, neighbour, would, not, confess, to, the, crimes, inspector, lvarez, a, colleague, of, vucetich, went, to, the, scene, and, found, a, bloody, thumb, mark, on, a, door, when, it, was, compared, with, rojas, prints, it, was, found, to, be, identical, with, her, right, thumb, she, then, confessed, to, the, murder, of, her, sons, this, was, the, first, known, murder, case, to, be, solved, using, fingerprint, analysis, in, kolkata, a, fingerprint, bureau, was, established, in, 1897, after, the, council, of, the, governor, general, approved, a, committee, report, that, fingerprints, should, be, used, for, the, classification, of, criminal, records, the, bureau, employees, azizul, haque, and, hem, chandra, bose, have, been, credited, with, the, primary, development, of, a, fingerprint, classification, system, eventually, named, after, their, supervisor, sir, edward, richard, henry, the, french, scientist, paul, jean, coulier, developed, a, method, to, transfer, latent, fingerprints, on, surfaces, to, paper, using, iodine, fuming, it, allowed, the, london, scotland, yard, to, start, fingerprinting, individuals, and, identify, criminals, using, fingerprints, in, 1901, soon, after, american, police, departments, adopted, the, same, method, and, fingerprint, identification, became, a, standard, practice, in, the, united, states, the, scheffer, case, of, 1902, is, the, first, case, of, the, identification, arrest, and, conviction, of, a, murderer, based, upon, fingerprint, evidence, alphonse, bertillon, identified, the, thief, and, murderer, scheffer, who, had, previously, been, arrested, and, his, fingerprints, filed, some, months, before, from, the, fingerprints, found, on, a, fractured, glass, showcase, after, a, theft, in, a, dentist, s, apartment, where, the, dentist, s, employee, was, found, dead, it, was, able, to, be, proved, in, court, that, the, fingerprints, had, been, made, after, the, showcase, was, broken, the, identification, of, individuals, through, fingerprints, for, law, enforcement, has, been, considered, essential, in, the, united, states, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, body, identification, using, fingerprints, has, also, been, valuable, in, the, aftermath, of, natural, disasters, and, anthropogenic, hazards, in, the, united, states, the, fbi, manages, a, fingerprint, identification, system, and, database, called, the, integrated, automated, fingerprint, identification, system, iafis, which, currently, holds, the, fingerprints, and, criminal, records, of, over, 51, million, criminal, record, subjects, and, over, 1, 5, million, civil, non, criminal, fingerprint, records, obim, formerly, u, s, visit, holds, the, largest, repository, of, biometric, identifiers, in, the, u, s, government, at, over, 260, million, individual, identities, when, it, was, deployed, in, 2004, this, repository, known, as, the, automated, biometric, identification, system, ident, stored, biometric, data, in, the, form, of, two, finger, records, between, 2005, and, 2009, the, dhs, transitioned, to, a, ten, print, record, standard, in, order, to, establish, interoperability, with, iafis, in, 1910, edmond, locard, established, the, first, forensic, lab, in, france, criminals, may, wear, gloves, to, avoid, leaving, fingerprints, however, the, gloves, themselves, can, leave, prints, that, are, as, unique, as, human, fingerprints, after, collecting, glove, prints, law, enforcement, can, match, them, to, gloves, that, they, have, collected, as, evidence, or, to, prints, collected, at, other, crime, scenes, in, many, jurisdictions, the, act, of, wearing, gloves, itself, while, committing, a, crime, can, be, prosecuted, as, an, inchoate, offense, the, non, governmental, organization, ngo, privacy, international, in, 2002, made, the, cautionary, announcement, that, tens, of, thousands, of, uk, school, children, were, being, fingerprinted, by, schools, often, without, the, knowledge, or, consent, of, their, parents, that, same, year, the, supplier, micro, librarian, systems, which, uses, a, technology, similar, to, that, used, in, us, prisons, and, the, german, military, estimated, that, 350, schools, throughout, britain, were, using, such, systems, to, replace, library, cards, by, 2007, it, was, estimated, that, 3, 500, schools, were, using, such, systems, under, the, united, kingdom, data, protection, act, schools, in, the, uk, do, not, have, to, ask, parental, consent, to, allow, such, practices, to, take, place, parents, opposed, to, fingerprinting, may, bring, only, individual, complaints, against, schools, in, response, to, a, complaint, which, they, are, continuing, to, pursue, in, 2010, the, european, commission, expressed, significant, concerns, over, the, proportionality, and, necessity, of, the, practice, and, the, lack, of, judicial, redress, indicating, that, the, practice, may, break, the, european, union, data, protection, directive, in, march, 2007, the, uk, government, was, considering, fingerprinting, all, children, aged, 11, to, 15, and, adding, the, prints, to, a, government, database, as, part, of, a, new, passport, and, id, card, scheme, and, disallowing, opposition, for, privacy, concerns, all, fingerprints, taken, would, be, cross, checked, against, prints, from, 900, 000, unsolved, crimes, shadow, home, secretary, david, davis, called, the, plan, sinister, the, liberal, democrat, home, affairs, spokesman, nick, clegg, criticised, the, determination, to, build, a, surveillance, state, behind, the, backs, of, the, british, people, the, uk, s, junior, education, minister, lord, adonis, defended, the, use, of, fingerprints, by, schools, to, track, school, attendance, as, well, as, access, to, school, meals, and, libraries, and, reassured, the, house, of, lords, that, the, children, s, fingerprints, had, been, taken, with, the, consent, of, the, parents, and, would, be, destroyed, once, children, left, the, school, an, early, day, motion, which, called, on, the, uk, government, to, conduct, a, full, and, open, consultation, with, stakeholders, about, the, use, of, biometrics, in, schools, secured, the, support, of, 85, members, of, parliament, early, day, motion, 686, following, the, establishment, in, the, united, kingdom, of, a, conservative, and, liberal, democratic, coalition, government, in, may, 2010, the, uk, id, card, scheme, was, scrapped, serious, concerns, about, the, security, implications, of, using, conventional, biometric, templates, in, schools, have, been, raised, by, a, number, of, leading, it, security, experts, one, of, whom, has, voiced, the, opinion, that, it, is, absolutely, premature, to, begin, using, conventional, biometrics, in, schools, the, vendors, of, biometric, systems, claim, that, their, products, bring, benefits, to, schools, such, as, improved, reading, skills, decreased, wait, times, in, lunch, lines, and, increased, revenues, they, do, not, cite, independent, research, to, support, this, view, one, education, specialist, wrote, in, 2007, i, have, not, been, able, to, find, a, single, piece, of, published, research, which, suggests, that, the, use, of, biometrics, in, schools, promotes, healthy, eating, or, improves, reading, skills, amongst, children, there, is, absolutely, no, evidence, for, such, claims, the, ottawa, police, in, canada, have, advised, parents, who, fear, their, children, may, be, kidnapped, to, fingerprint, their, children, a, very, rare, medical, condition, adermatoglyphia, is, characterized, by, the, absence, of, fingerprints, affected, persons, have, completely, smooth, fingertips, palms, toes, and, soles, but, no, other, medical, signs, or, symptoms, a, 2011, study, indicated, that, adermatoglyphia, is, caused, by, the, improper, expression, of, the, protein, smarcad1, the, condition, has, been, called, immigration, delay, disease, by, the, researchers, describing, it, because, the, congenital, lack, of, fingerprints, causes, delays, when, affected, persons, attempt, to, prove, their, identity, while, traveling, only, five, families, with, this, condition, had, been, described, as, of, 2011, people, with, naegeli, franceschetti, jadassohn, syndrome, and, dermatopathia, pigmentosa, reticularis, which, are, both, forms, of, ectodermal, dysplasia, also, have, no, fingerprints, both, of, these, rare, genetic, syndromes, produce, other, signs, and, symptoms, as, well, such, as, thin, brittle, hair, the, anti, cancer, medication, capecitabine, may, cause, the, loss, of, fingerprints, swelling, of, the, fingers, such, as, that, caused, by, bee, stings, will, in, some, cases, cause, the, temporary, disappearance, of, fingerprints, though, they, will, return, when, the, swelling, recedes, since, the, elasticity, of, skin, decreases, with, age, many, senior, citizens, have, fingerprints, that, are, difficult, to, capture, the, ridges, get, thicker, the, height, between, the, top, of, the, ridge, and, the, bottom, of, the, furrow, gets, narrow, so, there, is, less, prominence, fingerprints, can, be, erased, permanently, and, this, can, potentially, be, used, by, criminals, to, reduce, their, chance, of, conviction, erasure, can, be, achieved, in, a, variety, of, ways, including, simply, burning, the, fingertips, using, acids, and, advanced, techniques, such, as, plastic, surgery, john, dillinger, burned, his, fingers, with, acid, but, prints, taken, during, a, previous, arrest, and, upon, death, still, exhibited, almost, complete, relation, to, one, another, fingerprints, can, be, captured, as, graphical, ridge, and, valley, patterns, because, of, their, uniqueness, and, permanence, fingerprints, emerged, as, the, most, widely, used, biometric, identifier, in, the, 2000s, automated, fingerprint, verification, systems, were, developed, to, meet, the, needs, of, law, enforcement, and, their, use, became, more, widespread, in, civilian, applications, despite, being, deployed, more, widely, reliable, automated, fingerprint, verification, remained, a, challenge, and, was, extensively, researched, in, the, context, of, pattern, recognition, and, image, processing, the, uniqueness, of, a, fingerprint, can, be, established, by, the, overall, pattern, of, ridges, and, valleys, or, the, logical, ridge, discontinuities, known, as, minutiae, in, the, 2000s, minutiae, features, were, considered, the, most, discriminating, and, reliable, feature, of, a, fingerprint, therefore, the, recognition, of, minutiae, features, became, the, most, common, basis, for, automated, fingerprint, verification, the, most, widely, used, minutiae, features, used, for, automated, fingerprint, verification, were, the, ridge, ending, and, the, ridge, bifurcation, the, three, basic, patterns, of, fingerprint, ridges, are, the, arch, loop, and, whorl, scientists, have, found, that, family, members, often, share, the, same, general, fingerprint, patterns, leading, to, the, belief, that, these, patterns, are, inherited, features, of, fingerprint, ridges, called, minutiae, include, a, fingerprint, sensor, is, an, electronic, device, used, to, capture, a, digital, image, of, the, fingerprint, pattern, the, captured, image, is, called, a, live, scan, this, live, scan, is, digitally, processed, to, create, a, biometric, template, a, collection, of, extracted, features, which, is, stored, and, used, for, matching, many, technologies, have, been, used, including, optical, capacitive, rf, thermal, piezoresistive, ultrasonic, piezoelectric, and, mems, since, 2000, electronic, fingerprint, readers, have, been, introduced, as, consumer, electronics, security, applications, fingerprint, sensors, could, be, used, for, login, authentication, and, the, identification, of, computer, users, however, some, less, sophisticated, sensors, have, been, discovered, to, be, vulnerable, to, quite, simple, methods, of, deception, such, as, fake, fingerprints, cast, in, gels, in, 2006, fingerprint, sensors, gained, popularity, in, the, laptop, market, built, in, sensors, in, laptops, such, as, thinkpad, vaio, hp, pavilion, and, elitebook, laptops, and, others, also, double, as, motion, detectors, for, document, scrolling, like, the, scroll, wheel, two, of, the, first, smartphone, manufacturers, to, integrate, fingerprint, recognition, into, their, phones, were, motorola, with, the, atrix, 4g, in, 2011, and, apple, with, the, iphone, 5s, on, september, 10, 2013, one, month, after, htc, launched, the, one, max, which, also, included, fingerprint, recognition, in, april, 2014, samsung, released, the, galaxy, s5, which, integrated, a, fingerprint, sensor, on, the, home, button, following, the, release, of, the, iphone, 5s, model, a, group, of, german, hackers, announced, on, september, 21, 2013, that, they, had, bypassed, apple, s, new, touch, id, fingerprint, sensor, by, photographing, a, fingerprint, from, a, glass, surface, and, using, that, captured, image, as, verification, the, spokesman, for, the, group, stated, we, hope, that, this, finally, puts, to, rest, the, illusions, people, have, about, fingerprint, biometrics, it, is, plain, stupid, to, use, something, that, you, can, t, change, and, that, you, leave, everywhere, every, day, as, a, security, token, in, september, 2015, apple, included, a, new, version, of, the, fingerprint, scanner, in, the, iphone, home, button, with, the, iphone, 6s, the, use, of, the, touch, id, fingerprint, scanner, was, optional, and, could, be, configured, to, unlock, the, screen, or, pay, for, mobile, apps, purchases, since, december, 2015, cheaper, smartphones, with, fingerprint, recognition, have, been, released, such, as, the, 100, umi, fair, samsung, introduced, fingerprint, sensors, to, its, mid, range, a, series, smartphones, in, 2014, by, 2017, hewlett, packard, asus, huawei, lenovo, and, apple, were, using, fingerprint, readers, in, their, laptops, synaptics, says, the, securepad, sensor, is, now, available, for, oems, to, start, building, into, their, laptops, in, 2018, synaptics, revealed, that, their, in, display, fingerprint, sensors, would, be, featured, on, the, new, vivo, x21, ud, smartphone, this, was, the, first, mass, produced, fingerprint, sensor, to, be, integrated, into, the, entire, touchscreen, display, rather, than, as, a, separate, sensor, matching, algorithms, are, used, to, compare, previously, stored, templates, of, fingerprints, against, candidate, fingerprints, for, authentication, purposes, in, order, to, do, this, either, the, original, image, must, be, directly, compared, with, the, candidate, image, or, certain, features, must, be, compared, pre, processing, enhances, the, quality, of, an, image, by, filtering, and, removing, extraneous, noise, the, minutiae, based, algorithm, is, only, effective, with, 8, bit, gray, scale, fingerprint, images, one, reason, for, this, is, that, an, 8, bit, gray, fingerprint, image, is, a, fundamental, base, when, converting, the, image, to, a, 1, bit, image, with, value, 1, for, ridges, and, value, 0, for, furrows, this, process, allows, for, enhanced, edge, detection, so, the, fingerprint, is, revealed, in, high, contrast, with, the, ridges, highlighted, in, black, and, the, furrows, in, white, to, further, optimize, the, input, image, s, quality, two, more, steps, are, required, minutiae, extraction, and, false, minutiae, removal, the, minutiae, extraction, is, carried, out, by, applying, a, ridge, thinning, algorithm, that, removes, redundant, pixels, of, ridges, as, a, result, the, thinned, ridges, of, the, fingerprint, image, are, marked, with, a, unique, id, to, facilitate, the, conduction, of, further, operations, after, the, minutiae, extraction,
