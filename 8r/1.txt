death, is, the, end, of, life, the, irreversible, cessation, of, all, biological, functions, that, sustain, a, living, organism, the, remains, of, a, former, organism, normally, begin, to, decompose, shortly, after, death, death, eventually, and, inevitably, occurs, in, all, organisms, some, organisms, such, as, turritopsis, dohrnii, are, biologically, immortal, however, they, can, still, die, from, means, other, than, aging, death, is, generally, applied, to, whole, organisms, the, equivalent, for, individual, components, of, an, organism, such, as, cells, or, tissues, is, necrosis, something, that, is, not, considered, an, organism, such, as, a, virus, can, be, physically, destroyed, but, is, not, said, to, die, as, a, virus, is, not, considered, alive, in, the, first, place, as, of, the, early, 21st, century, 56, million, people, die, per, year, the, most, common, reason, is, cardiovascular, disease, which, is, a, disease, that, affects, the, heart, or, blood, vessels, as, of, 2022, an, estimated, total, of, almost, 110, billion, humans, have, died, or, roughly, 94, of, all, humans, to, have, ever, lived, a, substudy, of, gerontology, known, as, biogerontology, seeks, to, eliminate, death, by, natural, aging, in, humans, often, through, the, application, of, natural, processes, found, in, certain, organisms, however, as, humans, do, not, have, the, means, to, apply, this, to, themselves, they, have, to, use, other, ways, to, reach, the, maximum, lifespan, for, a, human, often, through, lifestyle, changes, such, as, calorie, reduction, dieting, and, exercise, the, idea, of, lifespan, extension, is, considered, and, studied, as, a, way, for, people, to, live, longer, determining, when, a, person, has, definitively, died, has, proven, difficult, initially, death, was, defined, as, occurring, when, breathing, and, the, heartbeat, ceased, a, status, still, known, as, clinical, death, however, the, development, of, cardiopulmonary, resuscitation, cpr, meant, that, such, a, state, was, no, longer, strictly, irreversible, brain, death, was, then, considered, a, more, fitting, option, but, several, definitions, exist, for, this, some, people, believe, that, all, brain, functions, must, cease, others, believe, that, even, if, the, brainstem, is, still, alive, the, personality, and, identity, are, irretrievably, lost, so, therefore, the, person, should, be, considered, entirely, dead, brain, death, is, sometimes, used, as, a, legal, definition, of, death, for, all, organisms, with, a, brain, death, can, instead, be, focused, on, this, organ, the, cause, of, death, is, usually, considered, important, and, an, autopsy, can, be, done, there, are, many, causes, from, accidents, to, diseases, many, cultures, and, religions, have, a, concept, of, an, afterlife, that, may, hold, the, idea, of, judgment, of, good, and, bad, deeds, in, one, s, life, there, are, also, different, customs, for, honoring, the, body, such, as, a, funeral, cremation, or, sky, burial, after, a, death, an, obituary, may, be, posted, in, a, newspaper, and, the, survived, by, kin, and, friends, usually, go, through, the, grieving, process, the, concept, of, death, is, the, key, to, human, understanding, of, the, phenomenon, there, are, many, scientific, approaches, and, various, interpretations, of, the, concept, additionally, the, advent, of, life, sustaining, therapy, and, the, numerous, criteria, for, defining, death, from, both, a, medical, and, legal, standpoint, have, made, it, difficult, to, create, a, single, unifying, definition, one, of, the, challenges, in, defining, death, is, in, distinguishing, it, from, life, as, a, point, in, time, death, seems, to, refer, to, the, moment, when, life, ends, determining, when, death, has, occurred, is, difficult, as, cessation, of, life, functions, is, often, not, simultaneous, across, organ, systems, such, determination, therefore, requires, drawing, precise, conceptual, boundaries, between, life, and, death, this, is, difficult, due, to, there, being, little, consensus, on, how, to, define, life, it, is, possible, to, define, life, in, terms, of, consciousness, when, consciousness, ceases, an, organism, can, be, said, to, have, died, one, of, the, flaws, in, this, approach, is, that, there, are, many, organisms, that, are, alive, but, probably, not, conscious, another, problem, is, in, defining, consciousness, which, has, many, different, definitions, given, by, modern, scientists, psychologists, and, philosophers, additionally, many, religious, traditions, including, abrahamic, and, dharmic, traditions, hold, that, death, does, not, or, may, not, entail, the, end, of, consciousness, in, certain, cultures, death, is, more, of, a, process, than, a, single, event, it, implies, a, slow, shift, from, one, spiritual, state, to, another, other, definitions, for, death, focus, on, the, character, of, cessation, of, organismic, functioning, and, human, death, which, refers, to, irreversible, loss, of, personhood, more, specifically, death, occurs, when, a, living, entity, experiences, irreversible, cessation, of, all, functioning, as, it, pertains, to, human, life, death, is, an, irreversible, process, where, someone, loses, their, existence, as, a, person, historically, attempts, to, define, the, exact, moment, of, a, human, s, death, have, been, subjective, or, imprecise, death, was, defined, as, the, cessation, of, heartbeat, cardiac, arrest, and, breathing, but, the, development, of, cpr, and, prompt, defibrillation, have, rendered, that, definition, inadequate, because, breathing, and, heartbeat, can, sometimes, be, restarted, this, type, of, death, where, circulatory, and, respiratory, arrest, happens, is, known, as, the, circulatory, definition, of, death, cdd, proponents, of, the, cdd, believe, this, definition, is, reasonable, because, a, person, with, permanent, loss, of, circulatory, and, respiratory, function, should, be, considered, dead, critics, of, this, definition, state, that, while, cessation, of, these, functions, may, be, permanent, it, does, not, mean, the, situation, is, irreversible, because, if, cpr, is, applied, fast, enough, the, person, could, be, revived, thus, the, arguments, for, and, against, the, cdd, boil, down, to, defining, the, actual, words, permanent, and, irreversible, which, further, complicates, the, challenge, of, defining, death, furthermore, events, causally, linked, to, death, in, the, past, no, longer, kill, in, all, circumstances, without, a, functioning, heart, or, lungs, life, can, sometimes, be, sustained, with, a, combination, of, life, support, devices, organ, transplants, and, artificial, pacemakers, today, where, a, definition, of, the, moment, of, death, is, required, doctors, and, coroners, usually, turn, to, brain, death, or, biological, death, to, define, a, person, as, being, dead, people, are, considered, dead, when, the, electrical, activity, in, their, brain, ceases, it, is, presumed, that, an, end, of, electrical, activity, indicates, the, end, of, consciousness, suspension, of, consciousness, must, be, permanent, and, not, transient, as, occurs, during, certain, sleep, stages, and, especially, a, coma, in, the, case, of, sleep, electroencephalograms, eegs, are, used, to, tell, the, difference, the, category, of, brain, death, is, seen, as, problematic, by, some, scholars, for, instance, dr, franklin, miller, a, senior, faculty, member, at, the, department, of, bioethics, national, institutes, of, health, notes, by, the, late, 1990s, the, equation, of, brain, death, with, death, of, the, human, being, was, increasingly, challenged, by, scholars, based, on, evidence, regarding, the, array, of, biological, functioning, displayed, by, patients, correctly, diagnosed, as, having, this, condition, who, were, maintained, on, mechanical, ventilation, for, substantial, periods, of, time, these, patients, maintained, the, ability, to, sustain, circulation, and, respiration, control, temperature, excrete, wastes, heal, wounds, fight, infections, and, most, dramatically, to, gestate, fetuses, in, the, case, of, pregnant, brain, dead, women, while, brain, death, is, viewed, as, problematic, by, some, scholars, there, are, proponents, of, it, that, believe, this, definition, of, death, is, the, most, reasonable, for, distinguishing, life, from, death, the, reasoning, behind, the, support, for, this, definition, is, that, brain, death, has, a, set, of, criteria, that, is, reliable, and, reproducible, also, the, brain, is, crucial, in, determining, our, identity, or, who, we, are, as, human, beings, the, distinction, should, be, made, that, brain, death, cannot, be, equated, with, one, in, a, vegetative, state, or, coma, in, that, the, former, situation, describes, a, state, that, is, beyond, recovery, eegs, can, detect, spurious, electrical, impulses, while, certain, drugs, hypoglycemia, hypoxia, or, hypothermia, can, suppress, or, even, stop, brain, activity, temporarily, because, of, this, hospitals, have, protocols, for, determining, brain, death, involving, eegs, at, widely, separated, intervals, under, defined, conditions, people, maintaining, that, only, the, neo, cortex, of, the, brain, is, necessary, for, consciousness, sometimes, argue, that, only, electrical, activity, should, be, considered, when, defining, death, eventually, the, criterion, for, death, may, be, the, permanent, and, irreversible, loss, of, cognitive, function, as, evidenced, by, the, death, of, the, cerebral, cortex, all, hope, of, recovering, human, thought, and, personality, is, then, gone, given, current, and, foreseeable, medical, technology, even, by, whole, brain, criteria, the, determination, of, brain, death, can, be, complicated, at, present, in, most, places, the, more, conservative, definition, of, death, irreversible, cessation, of, electrical, activity, in, the, whole, brain, as, opposed, to, just, in, the, neo, cortex, has, been, adopted, one, example, is, the, uniform, determination, of, death, act, in, the, united, states, in, the, past, the, adoption, of, this, whole, brain, definition, was, a, conclusion, of, the, president, s, commission, for, the, study, of, ethical, problems, in, medicine, and, biomedical, and, behavioral, research, in, 1980, they, concluded, that, this, approach, to, defining, death, sufficed, in, reaching, a, uniform, definition, nationwide, a, multitude, of, reasons, was, presented, to, support, this, definition, including, uniformity, of, standards, in, law, for, establishing, death, consumption, of, a, family, s, fiscal, resources, for, artificial, life, support, and, legal, establishment, for, equating, brain, death, with, death, to, proceed, with, organ, donation, aside, from, the, issue, of, support, of, or, dispute, against, brain, death, there, is, another, inherent, problem, in, this, categorical, definition, the, variability, of, its, application, in, medical, practice, in, 1995, the, american, academy, of, neurology, aan, established, the, criteria, that, became, the, medical, standard, for, diagnosing, neurologic, death, at, that, time, three, clinical, features, had, to, be, satisfied, to, determine, irreversible, cessation, of, the, total, brain, including, coma, with, clear, etiology, cessation, of, breathing, and, lack, of, brainstem, reflexes, these, criteria, were, updated, again, most, recently, in, 2010, but, substantial, discrepancies, remain, across, hospitals, and, medical, specialties, the, problem, of, defining, death, is, especially, imperative, as, it, pertains, to, the, dead, donor, rule, which, could, be, understood, as, one, of, the, following, interpretations, of, the, rule, there, must, be, an, official, declaration, of, death, in, a, person, before, starting, organ, procurement, or, that, organ, procurement, cannot, result, in, the, death, of, the, donor, a, great, deal, of, controversy, has, surrounded, the, definition, of, death, and, the, dead, donor, rule, advocates, of, the, rule, believe, that, the, rule, is, legitimate, in, protecting, organ, donors, while, also, countering, any, moral, or, legal, objection, to, organ, procurement, critics, on, the, other, hand, believe, that, the, rule, does, not, uphold, the, best, interests, of, the, donors, and, that, the, rule, does, not, effectively, promote, organ, donation, signs, of, death, or, strong, indications, that, a, warm, blooded, animal, is, no, longer, alive, are, the, stages, that, follow, after, death, are, the, death, of, a, person, has, legal, consequences, that, may, vary, between, jurisdictions, most, countries, follow, the, whole, brain, death, criteria, where, all, functions, of, the, brain, must, have, completely, ceased, however, in, other, jurisdictions, some, follow, the, brainstem, version, of, brain, death, afterward, a, death, certificate, is, issued, in, most, jurisdictions, either, by, a, doctor, or, by, an, administrative, office, upon, presentation, of, a, doctor, s, declaration, of, death, there, are, many, anecdotal, references, to, people, being, declared, dead, by, physicians, and, then, coming, back, to, life, sometimes, days, later, in, their, coffin, or, when, embalming, procedures, are, about, to, begin, from, the, mid, 18th, century, onwards, there, was, an, upsurge, in, the, public, s, fear, of, being, mistakenly, buried, alive, and, much, debate, about, the, uncertainty, of, the, signs, of, death, various, suggestions, were, made, to, test, for, signs, of, life, before, burial, ranging, from, pouring, vinegar, and, pepper, into, the, corpse, s, mouth, to, applying, red, hot, pokers, to, the, feet, or, into, the, rectum, writing, in, 1895, the, physician, j, c, ouseley, claimed, that, as, many, as, 2, 700, people, were, buried, prematurely, each, year, in, england, and, wales, although, some, estimates, peg, the, figure, to, be, closer, to, 800, in, cases, of, electric, shock, cardiopulmonary, resuscitation, cpr, for, an, hour, or, longer, can, allow, stunned, nerves, to, recover, allowing, an, apparently, dead, person, to, survive, people, found, unconscious, under, icy, water, may, survive, if, their, faces, are, kept, continuously, cold, until, they, arrive, at, an, emergency, room, this, diving, response, in, which, metabolic, activity, and, oxygen, requirements, are, minimal, is, something, humans, share, with, cetaceans, called, the, mammalian, diving, reflex, as, medical, technologies, advance, ideas, about, when, death, occurs, may, have, to, be, reevaluated, in, light, of, the, ability, to, restore, a, person, to, vitality, after, longer, periods, of, apparent, death, as, happened, when, cpr, and, defibrillation, showed, that, cessation, of, heartbeat, is, inadequate, as, a, decisive, indicator, of, death, the, lack, of, electrical, brain, activity, may, not, be, enough, to, consider, someone, scientifically, dead, therefore, the, concept, of, information, theoretic, death, has, been, suggested, as, a, better, means, of, defining, when, true, death, occurs, though, the, concept, has, few, practical, applications, outside, the, field, of, cryonics, the, leading, cause, of, human, death, in, developing, countries, is, infectious, disease, the, leading, causes, in, developed, countries, are, atherosclerosis, heart, disease, and, stroke, cancer, and, other, diseases, related, to, obesity, and, aging, by, an, extremely, wide, margin, the, largest, unifying, cause, of, death, in, the, developed, world, is, biological, aging, leading, to, various, complications, known, as, aging, associated, diseases, these, conditions, cause, loss, of, homeostasis, leading, to, cardiac, arrest, causing, loss, of, oxygen, and, nutrient, supply, causing, irreversible, deterioration, of, the, brain, and, other, tissues, of, the, roughly, 150, 000, people, who, die, each, day, across, the, globe, about, two, thirds, die, of, age, related, causes, in, industrialized, nations, the, proportion, is, much, higher, approaching, 90, with, improved, medical, capability, dying, has, become, a, condition, to, be, managed, in, developing, nations, inferior, sanitary, conditions, and, lack, of, access, to, modern, medical, technology, make, death, from, infectious, diseases, more, common, than, in, developed, countries, one, such, disease, is, tuberculosis, a, bacterial, disease, that, killed, 1, 8, million, people, in, 2015, in, 2004, malaria, caused, about, 2, 7, million, deaths, annually, the, aids, death, toll, in, africa, may, reach, 90, 100, million, by, 2025, according, to, jean, ziegler, the, united, nations, special, reporter, on, the, right, to, food, 2000, mar, 2008, mortality, due, to, malnutrition, accounted, for, 58, of, the, total, mortality, rate, in, 2006, ziegler, says, worldwide, approximately, 62, million, people, died, from, all, causes, and, of, those, deaths, more, than, 36, million, died, of, hunger, or, diseases, due, to, deficiencies, in, micronutrients, tobacco, smoking, killed, 100, million, people, worldwide, in, the, 20th, century, and, could, kill, 1, billion, people, worldwide, in, the, 21st, century, a, world, health, organization, report, warned, many, leading, developed, world, causes, of, death, can, be, postponed, by, diet, and, physical, activity, but, the, accelerating, incidence, of, disease, with, age, still, imposes, limits, on, human, longevity, the, evolutionary, cause, of, aging, is, at, best, only, beginning, to, be, understood, it, has, been, suggested, that, direct, intervention, in, the, aging, process, may, now, be, the, most, effective, intervention, against, major, causes, of, death, selye, proposed, a, unified, non, specific, approach, to, many, causes, of, death, he, demonstrated, that, stress, decreases, the, adaptability, of, an, organism, and, proposed, to, describe, adaptability, as, a, special, resource, adaptation, energy, the, animal, dies, when, this, resource, is, exhausted, selye, assumed, that, adaptability, is, a, finite, supply, presented, at, birth, later, goldstone, proposed, the, concept, of, production, or, income, of, adaptation, energy, which, may, be, stored, up, to, a, limit, as, a, capital, reserve, of, adaptation, in, recent, works, adaptation, energy, is, considered, an, internal, coordinate, on, the, dominant, path, in, the, model, of, adaptation, it, is, demonstrated, that, oscillations, of, well, being, appear, when, the, reserve, of, adaptability, is, almost, exhausted, in, 2012, suicide, overtook, car, crashes, as, the, leading, cause, of, human, injury, deaths, in, the, u, s, followed, by, poisoning, falls, and, murder, accidents, and, disasters, from, nuclear, disasters, to, structural, collapses, also, claim, lives, one, of, the, deadliest, incidents, of, all, time, is, the, failure, of, the, 1975, banqiao, dam, failure, with, varying, estimates, up, to, 240, 000, dead, other, incidents, with, high, death, tolls, are, the, wanggongchang, explosion, when, a, gunpowder, factory, ended, up, with, 20, 000, deaths, a, collapse, of, a, wall, of, circus, maximus, that, killed, 13, 000, people, and, the, chernobyl, disaster, that, killed, between, 95, and, 4, 000, people, natural, disasters, kill, around, 45, 000, people, annually, although, this, number, can, vary, to, millions, to, thousands, on, a, per, decade, basis, some, of, the, deadliest, natural, disasters, are, the, 1931, china, floods, which, killed, an, estimated, 4, million, people, although, estimates, widely, vary, the, 1887, yellow, river, flood, which, killed, an, estimated, 2, million, people, in, china, and, the, 1970, bhola, cyclone, which, killed, as, many, as, 500, 000, people, in, pakistan, if, naturally, occurring, famines, are, considered, natural, disasters, the, chinese, famine, of, 1906, 1907, which, killed, 15, 20, million, people, can, be, considered, the, deadliest, natural, disaster, in, recorded, history, in, animals, predation, can, be, a, common, cause, of, death, livestock, have, a, 6, death, rate, from, predation, however, younger, animals, are, more, susceptible, to, predation, for, example, 50, of, young, foxes, die, to, birds, bobcats, coyotes, and, other, foxes, as, well, young, bear, cubs, in, the, yellowstone, national, park, only, have, a, 40, chance, to, survive, to, adulthood, from, other, bears, and, predators, an, autopsy, also, known, as, a, postmortem, examination, or, an, obduction, is, a, medical, procedure, that, consists, of, a, thorough, examination, of, a, human, corpse, to, determine, the, cause, and, manner, of, a, person, s, death, and, to, evaluate, any, disease, or, injury, that, may, be, present, it, is, usually, performed, by, a, specialized, medical, doctor, called, a, pathologist, autopsies, are, either, performed, for, legal, or, medical, purposes, a, forensic, autopsy, is, carried, out, when, the, cause, of, death, may, be, a, criminal, matter, while, a, clinical, or, academic, autopsy, is, performed, to, find, the, medical, cause, of, death, and, is, used, in, cases, of, unknown, or, uncertain, death, or, for, research, purposes, autopsies, can, be, further, classified, into, cases, where, external, examination, suffices, and, those, where, the, body, is, dissected, and, an, internal, examination, is, conducted, permission, from, next, of, kin, may, be, required, for, internal, autopsy, in, some, cases, once, an, internal, autopsy, is, complete, the, body, is, generally, reconstituted, by, sewing, it, back, together, a, necropsy, which, is, not, always, a, medical, procedure, was, a, term, previously, used, to, describe, an, unregulated, postmortem, examination, in, modern, times, this, term, is, more, commonly, associated, with, the, corpses, of, animals, death, before, birth, can, happen, in, several, ways, stillbirth, when, the, fetus, dies, before, or, during, the, delivery, process, miscarriage, when, the, embryo, dies, before, independent, survival, and, abortion, the, artificial, termination, of, the, pregnancy, stillbirth, and, miscarriage, can, happen, for, various, reasons, while, abortion, is, carried, out, purposely, stillbirth, can, happen, right, before, or, after, the, delivery, of, a, fetus, it, can, result, from, defects, of, the, fetus, or, risk, factors, present, in, the, mother, reductions, of, these, factors, caesarean, sections, when, risks, are, present, and, early, detection, of, birth, defects, have, lowered, the, rate, of, stillbirth, however, 1, of, births, in, the, united, states, end, in, a, stillbirth, a, miscarriage, is, defined, by, the, world, health, organization, as, the, expulsion, or, extraction, from, its, mother, of, an, embryo, or, fetus, weighing, 500g, or, less, miscarriage, is, one, of, the, most, frequent, problems, in, pregnancy, and, is, reported, in, around, 12, 15, of, all, clinical, pregnancies, however, by, including, pregnancy, losses, during, menstruation, it, could, be, up, to, 17, 22, of, all, pregnancies, there, are, many, risk, factors, involved, in, miscarriage, consumption, of, caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, drugs, having, a, previous, miscarriage, and, the, use, of, abortion, can, increase, the, chances, of, having, a, miscarriage, an, abortion, may, be, performed, for, many, reasons, such, as, pregnancy, from, rape, financial, constraints, of, having, a, child, teenage, pregnancy, and, the, lack, of, support, from, a, significant, other, there, are, two, forms, of, abortion, a, medical, abortion, and, an, in, clinic, abortion, or, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, surgical, abortion, a, medical, abortion, involves, taking, a, pill, that, will, terminate, the, pregnancy, no, more, than, 11, weeks, past, the, last, period, and, an, in, clinic, abortion, involves, a, medical, procedure, using, suction, to, empty, the, uterus, this, is, possible, after, 12, weeks, but, it, may, be, more, difficult, to, find, an, operating, doctor, who, will, go, through, with, the, procedure, senescence, refers, to, a, scenario, when, a, living, being, can, survive, all, calamities, but, eventually, dies, due, to, causes, relating, to, old, age, conversely, premature, death, can, refer, to, a, death, that, occurs, before, old, age, arrives, for, example, human, death, before, a, person, reaches, the, age, of, 75, animal, and, plant, cells, normally, reproduce, and, function, during, the, whole, period, of, natural, existence, but, the, aging, process, derives, from, the, deterioration, of, cellular, activity, and, the, ruination, of, regular, functioning, the, aptitude, of, cells, for, gradual, deterioration, and, mortality, means, that, cells, are, naturally, sentenced, to, stable, and, long, term, loss, of, living, capacities, even, despite, continuing, metabolic, reactions, and, viability, in, the, united, kingdom, for, example, nine, out, of, ten, of, all, the, deaths, that, occur, daily, relates, to, senescence, while, around, the, world, it, accounts, for, two, thirds, of, 150, 000, deaths, that, take, place, daily, almost, all, animals, who, survive, external, hazards, to, their, biological, functioning, eventually, die, from, biological, aging, known, in, life, sciences, as, senescence, some, organisms, experience, negligible, senescence, even, exhibiting, biological, immortality, these, include, the, jellyfish, turritopsis, dohrnii, the, hydra, and, the, planarian, unnatural, causes, of, death, include, suicide, and, predation, of, all, causes, roughly, 150, 000, people, die, around, the, world, each, day, of, these, two, thirds, die, directly, or, indirectly, due, to, senescence, but, in, industrialized, countries, such, as, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, and, germany, the, rate, approaches, 90, i, e, nearly, nine, out, of, ten, of, all, deaths, are, related, to, senescence, physiological, death, is, now, seen, as, a, process, more, than, an, event, conditions, once, considered, indicative, of, death, are, now, reversible, where, in, the, process, a, dividing, line, is, drawn, between, life, and, death, depends, on, factors, beyond, the, presence, or, absence, of, vital, signs, in, general, clinical, death, is, neither, necessary, nor, sufficient, for, a, determination, of, legal, death, a, patient, with, working, heart, and, lungs, determined, to, be, brain, dead, can, be, pronounced, legally, dead, without, clinical, death, occurring, life, extension, refers, to, an, increase, in, maximum, or, average, lifespan, especially, in, humans, by, slowing, or, reversing, aging, processes, through, anti, aging, measures, aging, is, the, most, common, cause, of, death, worldwide, aging, is, seen, as, inevitable, so, according, to, aubrey, de, grey, little, is, spent, on, research, into, anti, aging, therapies, a, phenomenon, known, as, pro, aging, trance, the, average, lifespan, is, determined, by, vulnerability, to, accidents, and, age, or, lifestyle, related, afflictions, such, as, cancer, or, cardiovascular, disease, extension, of, lifespan, can, be, achieved, by, good, diet, exercise, and, avoidance, of, hazards, such, as, smoking, maximum, lifespan, is, determined, by, the, rate, of, aging, for, a, species, inherent, in, its, genes, a, recognized, method, of, extending, maximum, lifespan, is, calorie, restriction, theoretically, the, extension, of, the, maximum, lifespan, can, be, achieved, by, reducing, the, rate, of, aging, damage, by, periodic, replacement, of, damaged, tissues, molecular, repair, or, rejuvenation, of, deteriorated, cells, and, tissues, a, united, states, poll, found, religious, and, irreligious, people, as, well, as, men, and, women, and, people, of, different, economic, classes, have, similar, rates, of, support, for, life, extension, while, africans, and, hispanics, have, higher, rates, of, support, than, white, people, 38, said, they, would, desire, to, have, their, aging, process, cured, researchers, of, life, extension, can, be, known, as, biomedical, gerontologists, they, try, to, understand, aging, and, develop, treatments, to, reverse, aging, processes, or, at, least, slow, them, for, the, improvement, of, health, and, maintenance, of, youthfulness, those, who, use, life, extension, findings, and, apply, them, to, themselves, are, called, life, extensionists, or, longevists, the, primary, life, extension, strategy, currently, is, to, apply, anti, aging, methods, to, attempt, to, live, long, enough, to, benefit, from, a, cure, for, aging, cryonics, from, greek, kryos, meaning, icy, cold, is, the, low, temperature, preservation, of, animals, including, humans, who, cannot, be, sustained, by, contemporary, medicine, with, the, hope, that, healing, and, resuscitation, may, be, possible, in, the, future, cryopreservation, of, people, and, other, large, animals, is, not, reversible, with, current, technology, the, stated, rationale, for, cryonics, is, that, people, who, are, considered, dead, by, current, legal, or, medical, definitions, may, not, necessarily, be, dead, according, to, the, more, stringent, information, theoretic, definition, of, death, some, scientific, literature, is, claimed, to, support, the, feasibility, of, cryonics, medical, science, and, cryobiologists, generally, regard, cryonics, with, skepticism, around, 1930, most, people, in, western, countries, died, in, their, own, homes, surrounded, by, family, and, comforted, by, clergy, neighbors, and, doctors, making, house, calls, by, the, mid, 20th, century, half, of, all, americans, died, in, a, hospital, by, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, only, about, 20, to, 25, of, people, in, developed, countries, died, outside, of, a, medical, institution, the, shift, from, dying, at, home, towards, dying, in, a, professional, medical, environment, has, been, termed, the, invisible, death, this, shift, occurred, gradually, over, the, years, until, most, deaths, now, occur, outside, the, home, death, studies, is, a, field, within, psychology, to, varying, degrees, people, inherently, fear, death, both, the, process, and, the, eventuality, it, is, hard, wired, and, part, of, the, survival, instinct, of, all, animals, discussing, thinking, about, or, planning, for, their, deaths, causes, them, discomfort, this, fear, may, cause, them, to, put, off, financial, planning, preparing, a, will, and, testament, or, requesting, help, from, a, hospice, organization, mortality, salience, is, the, awareness, that, death, is, inevitable, however, self, esteem, and, culture, are, ways, to, reduce, the, anxiety, this, effect, can, cause, the, awareness, of, someone, s, own, death, can, cause, a, deepened, bond, in, their, in, group, as, a, defense, mechanism, this, can, also, cause, the, person, to, become, very, judging, in, a, study, two, groups, were, formed, one, group, was, asked, to, reflect, upon, their, mortality, the, other, was, not, afterwards, the, groups, were, told, to, set, a, bond, for, a, prostitute, the, group, that, did, not, reflect, on, death, had, an, average, of, 50, the, group, who, was, reminded, about, their, death, had, an, average, of, 455, different, people, have, different, responses, to, the, idea, of, their, deaths, philosopher, galen, strawson, writes, that, the, death, that, many, people, wish, for, is, an, instant, painless, unexperienced, annihilation, in, this, unlikely, scenario, the, person, dies, without, realizing, it, and, without, being, able, to, fear, it, one, moment, the, person, is, walking, eating, or, sleeping, and, the, next, moment, the, person, is, dead, strawson, reasons, that, this, type, of, death, would, not, take, anything, away, from, the, person, as, he, believes, a, person, cannot, have, a, legitimate, claim, to, ownership, in, the, future, in, society, the, nature, of, death, and, humanity, s, awareness, of, its, mortality, has, for, millennia, been, a, concern, of, the, world, s, religious, traditions, and, philosophical, inquiry, including, belief, in, resurrection, or, an, afterlife, associated, with, abrahamic, religions, reincarnation, or, rebirth, associated, with, dharmic, religions, or, that, consciousness, permanently, ceases, to, exist, known, as, eternal, oblivion, associated, with, secular, humanism, commemoration, ceremonies, after, death, may, include, various, mourning, funeral, practices, and, ceremonies, of, honoring, the, deceased, the, physical, remains, of, a, person, commonly, known, as, a, corpse, or, body, are, usually, interred, whole, or, cremated, though, among, the, world, s, cultures, there, are, a, variety, of, other, methods, of, mortuary, disposal, in, the, english, language, blessings, directed, towards, a, dead, person, include, rest, in, peace, originally, the, latin, requiescat, in, pace, or, its, initialism, rip, death, is, the, center, of, many, traditions, and, organizations, customs, relating, to, death, are, a, feature, of, every, culture, around, the, world, much, of, this, revolves, around, the, care, of, the, dead, as, well, as, the, afterlife, and, the, disposal, of, bodies, upon, the, onset, of, death, the, disposal, of, human, corpses, does, in, general, begin, with, the, last, offices, before, significant, time, has, passed, and, ritualistic, ceremonies, often, occur, most, commonly, interment, or, cremation, this, is, not, a, unified, practice, in, tibet, for, instance, the, body, is, given, a, sky, burial, and, left, on, a, mountain, top, proper, preparation, for, death, and, techniques, and, ceremonies, for, producing, the, ability, to, transfer, one, s, spiritual, attainments, into, another, body, reincarnation, are, subjects, of, detailed, study, in, tibet, mummification, or, embalming, is, also, prevalent, in, some, cultures, to, retard, the, rate, of, decay, the, rise, of, secularism, resulted, in, material, mementos, of, death, declining, some, parts, of, death, in, culture, are, legally, based, having, laws, for, when, death, occurs, such, as, the, receiving, of, a, death, certificate, the, settlement, of, the, deceased, estate, and, the, issues, of, inheritance, and, in, some, countries, inheritance, taxation, capital, punishment, is, also, a, culturally, divisive, aspect, of, death, in, most, jurisdictions, where, capital, punishment, is, carried, out, today, the, death, penalty, is, reserved, for, premeditated, murder, espionage, treason, or, as, part, of, military, justice, in, some, countries, sexual, crimes, such, as, adultery, and, sodomy, carry, the, death, penalty, as, do, religious, crimes, such, as, apostasy, the, formal, renunciation, of, one, s, religion, in, many, retentionist, countries, drug, trafficking, is, also, a, capital, offense, in, china, human, trafficking, and, serious, cases, of, corruption, are, also, punished, by, the, death, penalty, in, militaries, around, the, world, courts, martial, have, imposed, death, sentences, for, offenses, such, as, cowardice, desertion, insubordination, and, mutiny, mutiny, is, punishable, by, death, in, the, united, states, death, in, warfare, and, suicide, attacks, also, have, cultural, links, and, the, ideas, of, dulce, et, decorum, est, pro, patria, mori, which, translates, to, it, is, sweet, and, proper, to, die, for, one, s, country, is, a, concept, that, dates, to, antiquity, additionally, grieving, relatives, of, dead, soldiers, and, death, notification, are, embedded, in, many, cultures, recently, in, the, western, world, with, the, increase, in, terrorism, following, the, september, 11, attacks, but, also, further, back, in, time, with, suicide, bombings, kamikaze, missions, in, world, war, ii, and, suicide, missions, in, a, host, of, other, conflicts, in, history, death, for, a, cause, by, way, of, suicide, attack, including, martyrdom, have, had, significant, cultural, impacts, suicide, in, general, and, particularly, euthanasia, are, also, points, of, cultural, debate, both, acts, are, understood, very, differently, in, different, cultures, in, japan, for, example, ending, a, life, with, honor, by, seppuku, was, considered, a, desirable, death, whereas, according, to, traditional, christian, and, islamic, cultures, suicide, is, viewed, as, a, sin, death, is, personified, in, many, cultures, with, such, symbolic, representations, as, the, grim, reaper, azrael, the, hindu, god, yama, and, father, time, in, the, west, the, grim, reaper, or, figures, similar, to, it, is, the, most, popular, depiction, of, death, in, western, cultures, in, brazil, death, is, counted, officially, when, it, is, registered, by, existing, family, members, at, a, cart, rio, a, government, authorized, registry, before, being, able, to, file, for, an, official, death, the, deceased, must, have, been, registered, for, an, official, birth, at, the, cart, rio, though, a, public, registry, law, guarantees, all, brazilian, citizens, the, right, to, register, deaths, regardless, of, their, financial, means, of, their, family, members, often, children, the, brazilian, government, has, not, taken, away, the, burden, the, hidden, costs, and, fees, of, filing, for, a, death, for, many, impoverished, families, the, indirect, costs, and, burden, of, filing, for, a, death, lead, to, a, more, appealing, unofficial, local, and, cultural, burial, which, in, turn, raises, the, debate, about, inaccurate, mortality, rates, talking, about, death, and, witnessing, it, is, a, difficult, issue, in, most, cultures, western, societies, may, like, to, treat, the, dead, with, the, utmost, material, respect, with, an, official, embalmer, and, associated, rites, eastern, societies, like, india, may, be, more, open, to, accepting, it, as, a, fait, accompli, with, a, funeral, procession, of, the, dead, body, ending, in, an, open, air, burning, to, ashes, the, origin, of, death, is, a, theme, or, myth, of, how, death, came, to, be, it, is, present, in, nearly, all, cultures, across, the, world, as, death, is, a, universal, happening, this, makes, it, an, origin, myth, a, myth, that, describes, how, a, feature, of, the, natural, or, social, world, appeared, there, can, be, some, similarities, between, myths, and, cultures, in, north, american, mythology, the, theme, of, a, man, who, wants, to, be, immortal, and, a, man, who, wants, to, die, can, be, seen, across, many, indigenous, people, in, christianity, death, is, the, result, of, the, fall, of, man, after, eating, the, fruit, from, the, tree, of, the, knowledge, of, good, and, evil, in, greek, mythology, the, opening, of, pandora, s, box, releases, death, upon, the, world, much, interest, and, debate, surround, the, question, of, what, happens, to, one, s, consciousness, as, one, s, body, dies, the, belief, in, the, permanent, loss, of, consciousness, after, death, is, often, called, eternal, oblivion, the, belief, that, the, stream, of, consciousness, is, preserved, after, physical, death, is, described, by, the, term, afterlife, near, death, experiences, ndes, describe, the, subjective, experiences, associated, with, impending, death, some, survivors, of, such, experiences, report, it, as, seeing, the, afterlife, while, they, were, dying, seeing, a, being, of, light, and, talking, with, it, life, flashing, before, the, eyes, and, the, confirmation, of, cultural, beliefs, of, the, afterlife, are, common, themes, in, ndes, after, death, the, remains, of, a, former, organism, become, part, of, the, biogeochemical, cycle, during, which, animals, may, be, consumed, by, a, predator, or, a, scavenger, organic, material, may, then, be, further, decomposed, by, detritivores, organisms, that, recycle, detritus, returning, it, to, the, environment, for, reuse, in, the, food, chain, where, these, chemicals, may, eventually, end, up, being, consumed, and, assimilated, into, the, cells, of, an, organism, examples, of, detritivores, include, earthworms, woodlice, and, millipedes, microorganisms, also, play, a, vital, role, raising, the, temperature, of, the, decomposing, matter, as, they, break, it, down, into, yet, simpler, molecules, not, all, materials, need, to, be, fully, decomposed, coal, a, fossil, fuel, formed, over, vast, tracts, of, time, in, swamp, ecosystems, is, one, example, the, contemporary, evolutionary, theory, sees, death, as, an, important, part, of, the, process, of, natural, selection, it, is, considered, that, organisms, less, adapted, to, their, environment, are, more, likely, to, die, having, produced, fewer, offspring, thereby, reducing, their, contribution, to, the, gene, pool, their, genes, are, thus, eventually, bred, out, of, a, population, leading, at, worst, to, extinction, and, more, positively, making, the, process, possible, referred, to, as, speciation, frequency, of, reproduction, plays, an, equally, important, role, in, determining, species, survival, an, organism, that, dies, young, but, leaves, numerous, offspring, displays, according, to, darwinian, criteria, much, greater, fitness, than, a, long, lived, organism, leaving, only, one, death, also, has, a, role, in, competition, where, if, a, species, out, competes, another, there, is, a, risk, of, death, for, the, population, especially, in, the, case, where, they, are, directly, fighting, over, resources, death, plays, a, role, in, extinction, the, cessation, of, existence, of, a, species, or, group, of, taxa, reducing, biodiversity, due, to, extinction, being, generally, considered, to, be, the, death, of, the, last, individual, of, that, species, although, the, capacity, to, breed, and, recover, may, have, been, lost, before, this, point, because, a, species, potential, range, may, be, very, large, determining, this, moment, is, difficult, and, is, usually, done, retrospectively, inquiry, into, the, evolution, of, aging, aims, to, explain, why, so, many, living, things, and, the, vast, majority, of, animals, weaken, and, die, with, age, however, there, are, exceptions, such, as, hydra, and, the, jellyfish, turritopsis, dohrnii, which, research, shows, to, be, biologically, immortal, organisms, showing, only, asexual, reproduction, such, as, bacteria, some, protists, like, the, euglenoids, and, many, amoebozoans, and, unicellular, organisms, with, sexual, reproduction, colonial, or, not, like, the, volvocine, algae, pandorina, and, chlamydomonas, are, immortal, at, some, extent, dying, only, due, to, external, hazards, like, being, eaten, or, meeting, with, a, fatal, accident, in, multicellular, organisms, and, also, in, multinucleate, ciliates, with, a, weismannist, development, that, is, with, a, division, of, labor, between, mortal, somatic, body, cells, and, immortal, germ, reproductive, cells, death, becomes, an, essential, part, of, life, at, least, for, the, somatic, line, the, volvox, algae, are, among, the, simplest, organisms, to, exhibit, that, division, of, labor, between, two, completely, different, cell, types, and, as, a, consequence, include, the, death, of, somatic, line, as, a, regular, genetically, regulated, part, of, its, life, history, animals, have, sometimes, shown, grief, for, their, partners, or, friends, when, two, chimpanzees, form, a, bond, together, sexual, or, not, and, one, of, them, dies, the, surviving, chimpanzee, will, show, signs, of, grief, ripping, out, their, hair, in, anger, and, starting, to, cry, if, the, body, is, removed, they, will, resist, they, will, eventually, go, quiet, when, the, body, is, gone, but, upon, seeing, the, body, again, the, chimp, will, return, to, a, violent, state, furthermore, anthropologist, barbara, j, king, has, suggested, that, one, way, to, evaluate, the, expression, of, grief, in, animals, is, to, look, for, altered, behaviors, such, as, social, withdrawal, disrupted, eating, or, sleeping, expression, of, affect, or, increased, stress, reactions, in, response, to, the, death, of, a, family, member, mate, or, friend, these, criteria, do, not, assume, the, ability, to, anticipate, death, understand, its, finality, or, experience, emotions, equivalent, to, those, of, humans, but, at, the, same, time, do, not, rule, out, the, possibility, of, those, abilities, existing, in, some, animals, or, that, different, kinds, of, emotional, experiences, might, constitute, grief, based, on, these, criteria, king, gives, examples, of, observed, potential, mourning, behaviors, in, animals, such, as, cetaceans, apes, and, monkeys, elephants, domesticated, animals, including, dogs, cats, rabbits, horses, and, farmed, animals, giraffes, peccaries, donkeys, prairie, voles, and, some, species, of, birds, some, non, living, things, can, be, considered, dead, for, example, a, volcano, batteries, electrical, components, and, stars, are, all, nonliving, things, that, can, die, whether, from, destruction, or, cessation, of, function, a, volcano, a, break, in, the, earth, s, crust, that, allows, lava, ash, and, gases, to, escape, has, three, states, that, it, may, be, in, active, dormant, and, extinct, an, active, volcano, has, recently, or, is, currently, erupting, in, a, dormant, volcano, it, has, not, erupted, for, a, significant, amount, of, time, but, it, may, erupt, again, in, an, extinct, volcano, it, may, be, cut, off, from, the, supply, of, its, lava, and, will, never, be, expected, to, erupt, again, so, the, volcano, can, be, considered, to, be, dead, a, battery, can, be, considered, dead, after, the, charge, is, fully, used, up, electrical, components, are, similar, in, this, fashion, in, the, case, that, it, may, not, be, able, to, be, used, again, such, as, after, a, spill, of, water, on, the, components, the, component, can, be, considered, dead, stars, also, have, a, life, span, and, therefore, can, die, after, it, starts, to, run, out, of, fuel, it, starts, to, expand, this, can, be, analogous, to, the, star, aging, after, it, exhausts, all, fuel, it, may, explode, in, a, supernova, collapse, into, a, black, hole, or, turn, into, a, neutron, star, in, buddhist, doctrine, and, practice, death, plays, an, important, role, awareness, of, death, motivated, prince, siddhartha, to, strive, to, find, the, deathless, and, finally, attain, enlightenment, in, buddhist, doctrine, death, functions, as, a, reminder, of, the, value, of, having, been, born, as, a, human, being, rebirth, as, a, human, being, is, considered, the, only, state, in, which, one, can, attain, enlightenment, therefore, death, helps, remind, oneself, that, one, should, not, take, life, for, granted, the, belief, in, rebirth, among, buddhists, does, not, necessarily, remove, death, anxiety, since, all, existence, in, the, cycle, of, rebirth, is, considered, filled, with, suffering, and, being, reborn, many, times, does, not, necessarily, mean, that, one, progresses, death, is, part, of, several, key, buddhist, tenets, such, as, the, four, noble, truths, and, dependent, origination, while, there, are, different, sects, of, christianity, with, different, branches, of, belief, the, overarching, ideology, on, death, grows, from, the, knowledge, of, the, afterlife, after, death, the, individual, will, undergo, a, separation, from, mortality, to, immortality, their, soul, leaves, the, body, entering, a, realm, of, spirits, following, this, separation, of, body, and, spirit, death, resurrection, will, occur, representing, the, same, transformation, jesus, christ, embodied, after, his, body, was, placed, in, the, tomb, for, three, days, each, person, s, body, will, be, resurrected, reuniting, the, spirit, and, body, in, a, perfect, form, this, process, allows, the, individual, s, soul, to, withstand, death, and, transform, into, life, after, death, in, hindu, texts, death, is, described, as, the, individual, eternal, spiritual, jiva, atma, soul, or, conscious, self, exiting, the, current, temporary, material, body, the, soul, exits, this, body, when, the, body, can, no, longer, sustain, the, conscious, self, life, which, may, be, due, to, mental, or, physical, reasons, or, more, accurately, the, inability, to, act, on, one, s, kama, material, desires, during, conception, the, soul, enters, a, compatible, new, body, based, on, the, remaining, merits, and, demerits, of, one, s, karma, good, bad, material, activities, based, on, dharma, and, the, state, of, one, s, mind, impressions, or, last, thoughts, at, the, time, of, death, usually, the, process, of, reincarnation, makes, one, forget, all, memories, of, one, s, previous, life, because, nothing, really, dies, and, the, temporary, material, body, is, always, changing, both, in, this, life, and, the, next, death, means, forgetfulness, of, one, s, previous, experiences, the, islamic, view, is, that, death, is, the, separation, of, the, soul, from, the, body, as, well, as, the, beginning, of, the, afterlife, the, afterlife, or, akhirah, is, one, of, the, six, main, beliefs, in, islam, rather, than, seeing, death, as, the, end, of, life, muslims, consider, death, as, a, continuation, of, life, in, another, form, in, islam, life, on, earth, right, now, is, a, short, temporary, life, and, a, testing, period, for, every, soul, true, life, begins, with, the, day, of, judgement, when, all, people, will, be, divided, into, two, groups, the, righteous, believers, will, be, welcomed, to, janna, heaven, and, the, disbelievers, and, evildoers, will, be, punished, in, jahannam, hellfire, muslims, believe, death, to, be, wholly, natural, and, predetermined, by, god, only, god, knows, the, exact, time, of, a, person, s, death, the, quran, emphasizes, that, death, is, inevitable, no, matter, how, much, people, try, to, escape, death, it, will, reach, everyone, q50, 16, life, on, earth, is, the, one, and, only, chance, for, people, to, prepare, themselves, for, the, life, to, come, and, choose, to, either, believe, or, not, believe, in, god, and, death, is, the, end, of, that, learning, opportunity, there, are, a, variety, of, beliefs, about, the, afterlife, within, judaism, but, none, of, them, contradict, the, preference, for, life, over, death, this, is, partially, because, death, puts, a, cessation, to, the, possibility, of, fulfilling, any, commandments, the, word, death, comes, from, old, english, d, a, which, in, turn, comes, from, proto, germanic, dau, uz, reconstructed, by, etymological, analysis, this, comes, from, the, proto, indo, european, stem, dheu, meaning, the, process, act, condition, of, dying, the, concept, and, symptoms, of, death, and, varying, degrees, of, delicacy, used, in, discussion, in, public, forums, have, generated, numerous, scientific, legal, and, socially, acceptable, terms, or, euphemisms, when, a, person, has, died, it, is, also, said, they, have, passed, away, passed, on, expired, or, gone, among, other, socially, accepted, religiously, specific, slang, and, irreverent, terms, as, a, formal, reference, to, a, dead, person, it, has, become, common, practice, to, use, the, participle, form, of, decease, as, in, the, deceased, another, noun, form, is, decedent, bereft, of, life, the, dead, person, is, a, corpse, cadaver, body, set, of, remains, or, when, all, flesh, is, gone, a, skeleton, the, terms, carrion, and, carcass, are, also, used, usually, for, dead, non, human, animals, the, ashes, left, after, a, cremation, are, lately, called, cremains
