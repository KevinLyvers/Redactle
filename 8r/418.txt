the, geometer, moths, are, moths, belonging, to, the, family, geometridae, of, the, insect, order, lepidoptera, the, moths, and, butterflies, their, scientific, name, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, geo, derivative, form, of, or, the, earth, and, metron, measure, in, reference, to, the, way, their, larvae, or, inchworms, appear, to, measure, the, earth, as, they, move, along, in, a, looping, fashion, geometridae, is, a, very, large, family, containing, around, 23, 000, described, species, over, 1400, species, from, six, subfamilies, are, indigenous, to, north, america, alone, a, well, known, member, is, the, peppered, moth, biston, betularia, which, has, been, the, subject, of, numerous, studies, in, population, genetics, several, other, geometer, moths, are, notorious, pests, the, name, geometridae, ultimately, derives, from, latin, geometra, from, greek, geometer, earth, measurer, this, refers, to, the, means, of, locomotion, of, the, larvae, or, caterpillars, which, lack, the, full, complement, of, prolegs, seen, in, other, caterpillars, with, only, two, or, three, pairs, at, the, posterior, end, instead, of, the, usual, five, pairs, equipped, with, appendages, at, both, ends, of, the, body, a, caterpillar, clasps, with, its, front, legs, and, draws, up, the, hind, end, then, clasps, with, the, hind, end, prolegs, and, reaches, out, for, a, new, front, attachment, creating, the, impression, that, it, measures, its, journey, the, caterpillars, are, accordingly, called, loopers, spanworms, or, inchworms, after, their, characteristic, looping, gait, the, cabbage, looper, and, soybean, looper, are, not, inchworms, but, caterpillars, of, a, different, family, in, many, species, of, geometer, moths, the, inchworms, are, about, 25, mm, 1, 0, in, long, they, tend, to, be, green, grey, or, brownish, and, hide, from, predators, by, fading, into, the, background, or, resembling, twigs, when, disturbed, many, inchworms, stand, erect, and, motionless, on, their, prolegs, further, increasing, this, resemblance, some, have, humps, or, filaments, or, cover, themselves, in, plant, material, they, are, gregarious, and, are, generally, smooth, some, eat, lichen, flowers, or, pollen, while, some, such, as, the, hawaiian, species, of, the, genus, eupithecia, are, carnivorous, certain, destructive, inchworm, species, are, referred, to, as, cankerworms, in, 2019, the, first, geometrid, caterpillar, in, baltic, amber, was, discovered, by, german, scientists, described, under, eogeometer, vadens, it, measured, about, 5, mm, 0, 20, in, and, was, estimated, to, be, 44, million, years, old, dating, back, to, the, eocene, epoch, it, was, described, as, the, earliest, evidence, for, the, subfamily, of, ennominae, particularly, the, tribe, boarmiini, many, geometrids, have, slender, abdomens, and, broad, wings, which, are, usually, held, flat, with, the, hindwings, visible, as, such, they, appear, rather, butterfly, like, but, in, most, respects, they, are, typical, moths, the, majority, fly, at, night, they, possess, a, frenulum, to, link, the, wings, and, the, antennae, of, the, males, are, often, feathered, they, tend, to, blend, into, the, background, often, with, intricate, wavy, patterns, on, their, wings, in, some, species, females, have, reduced, wings, e, g, winter, moth, and, fall, cankerworm, most, are, of, moderate, size, about, 3, cm, 1, 2, in, in, wingspan, but, a, range, of, sizes, occur, from, 10, 50, mm, 0, 39, 1, 97, in, and, a, few, e, g, dysphania, species, reach, an, even, larger, size, they, have, distinctive, paired, tympanal, organs, at, the, base, of, the, abdomen, these, are, absent, in, flightless, females, the, placement, of, the, example, species, follows, a, 1990, systematic, treatment, it, may, be, outdated, subfamilies, are, tentatively, sorted, in, a, phylogenetic, sequence, from, the, most, basal, to, the, most, advanced, traditionally, the, archiearinae, were, held, to, be, the, most, ancient, of, the, geometer, moth, lineages, as, their, caterpillars, have, well, developed, prolegs, however, it, now, seems, that, the, larentiinae, are, actually, older, as, indicated, by, their, numerous, plesiomorphies, and, dna, sequence, data, they, are, either, an, extremely, basal, lineage, of, the, geometridae, together, with, the, sterrhinae, or, might, even, be, considered, a, separate, family, of, geometroidea, as, regards, the, archiearinae, some, species, that, were, traditionally, placed, therein, actually, seem, to, belong, to, other, subfamilies, altogether, it, seems, that, in, a, few, cases, the, prolegs, which, were, originally, lost, in, the, ancestral, geometer, moths, re, evolved, as, an, atavism, larentiinae, about, 5, 800, species, includes, the, pug, moths, mostly, temperate, might, be, a, distinct, family, sterrhinae, about, 2, 800, species, mostly, tropical, might, belong, to, same, family, as, the, larentiinae, desmobathrinae, pantropical, geometrinae, emerald, moths, about, 2, 300, named, species, most, tropical, archiearinae, twelve, species, holarctic, southern, andes, and, tasmania, though, the, latter, some, seem, to, belong, to, the, ennominae, larvae, have, all, the, prolegs, but, most, are, reduced, oenochrominae, in, some, treatments, used, as, a, wastebin, taxon, for, genera, that, are, difficult, to, place, in, other, groups, alsophilinae, a, few, genera, defoliators, of, trees, might, belong, in, the, ennominae, tribe, boarmiini, ennominae, about, 9, 700, species, including, some, defoliating, pests, global, distribution, geometridae, genera, incertae, sedis, include, fossil, geometridae, taxa, include
