48, see, text, the, moraceae, often, called, the, mulberry, family, or, fig, family, are, a, family, of, flowering, plants, comprising, about, 38, genera, and, over, 1100, species, most, are, widespread, in, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, less, so, in, temperate, climates, however, their, distribution, is, cosmopolitan, overall, the, only, synapomorphy, within, the, moraceae, is, presence, of, laticifers, and, milky, sap, in, all, parenchymatous, tissues, but, generally, useful, field, characters, include, two, carpels, sometimes, with, one, reduced, compound, inconspicuous, flowers, and, compound, fruits, the, family, includes, well, known, plants, such, as, the, fig, banyan, breadfruit, jackfruit, mulberry, and, osage, orange, the, flowers, of, moraceae, are, often, pseudanthia, reduced, inflorescences, the, family, varies, from, colossal, trees, like, the, indian, banyan, ficus, benghalensis, which, can, cover, five, acres, two, hectares, of, ground, to, dorstenia, barnimiana, which, is, a, small, stemless, bulbous, succulent, 2, 5, cm, in, diameter, that, produces, a, single, peltate, leaf, on, a, 4, 15, cm, petiole, these, two, species, have, an, approximately, one, billion, fold, difference, in, weight, the, individual, flowers, are, often, small, with, single, whorled, or, absent, perianth, most, flowers, have, either, petals, or, sepals, but, not, both, known, as, monochlamydeae, and, have, pistils, and, stamens, in, different, flowers, known, as, diclinous, except, for, brosimum, gaudichaudii, and, castilla, elastica, the, perianth, in, all, species, of, the, moraceae, contain, sepals, if, the, flower, has, an, inflexed, stamen, then, pollen, is, released, and, distributed, by, wind, dispersal, however, if, the, stamen, is, straight, then, insect, pollination, is, most, likely, to, occur, insect, pollination, occurs, in, antiaropsis, artocarpus, castilla, dorstenia, ficus, and, mesogyne, the, leaves, are, much, like, the, flowers, when, analyzing, diversity, the, leaves, can, be, singly, attached, to, the, stem, or, alternating, they, may, be, lobed, or, unlobed, and, can, be, evergreen, or, deciduous, depending, on, the, species, in, question, the, red, mulberry, can, host, numerous, leaf, types, on, the, same, tree, leaves, can, be, both, lobed, and, unlobed, and, appear, very, different, but, coexist, on, the, same, plant, plant, species, in, the, moraceae, are, best, known, for, their, fruits, overall, most, species, produced, a, fleshy, fruit, containing, seeds, examples, include, the, breadfruit, from, artocarpus, altilis, the, mulberry, from, morus, rubra, the, fig, from, ficus, carica, and, the, jackfruit, from, artocarpus, heterophyllus, formerly, included, within, the, now, defunct, order, urticales, recent, molecular, studies, have, resulted, in, the, family, s, placement, within, the, rosales, in, a, clade, called, the, urticalean, rosids, that, also, includes, ulmaceae, celtidaceae, cannabaceae, and, urticaceae, cecropia, which, has, variously, been, placed, in, the, moraceae, urticaceae, or, their, own, family, cecropiaceae, is, now, included, in, the, urticaceae, dioecy, having, individuals, with, separate, sexes, appears, to, be, the, primitive, state, in, moraceae, monoecy, has, evolved, independently, at, least, four, times, within, the, family, modern, molecular, phylogenetics, suggest, these, relationships, urticaceae, outgroup, batocarpus, clarisia, artocarpus, parartocarpus, prainea, sorocea, bagassa, milicia, streblus, morus, trophis, maclura, fatoua, broussonetia, malaisia, bleekrodea, sloetia, trilepisium, utsetela, dorstenia, brosimum, trymatococcus, helianthostylis, ficus, sparattosyce, antiaropsis, antiaris, mesogyne, naucleopsis, perebea, pseudolmedia, maquira, helicostylis, poulsenia, castilla, moraceae, is, comprised, 48, genera, in, seven, tribes, other, genera, accepted, by, plants, of, the, world, online, as, of, april, 2024, in, addition, to, the, living, species, a, number, of, fossil, genera, have, been, ascribed, to, the, family, while, the, fossil, record, of, moraceae, goes, back, to, the, late, cretaceous, molecular, clock, estimates, suggest, that, the, family, had, begun, to, diversify, by, the, mid, cretaceous, with, some, major, clades, emerging, during, the, tertiary, period, moraceae, can, be, found, throughout, the, world, with, a, cosmopolitan, distribution, the, majority, of, species, originate, in, the, old, world, tropics, particularly, in, asia, and, the, pacific, islands
