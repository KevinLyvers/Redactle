see, text, tetraodontidae, is, a, family, of, primarily, marine, and, estuarine, fish, of, the, order, tetraodontiformes, the, family, includes, many, familiar, species, variously, called, pufferfish, puffers, balloonfish, blowfish, blowers, blowies, bubblefish, globefish, swellfish, toadfish, toadies, toadle, honey, toads, sugar, toads, and, sea, squab, they, are, morphologically, similar, to, the, closely, related, porcupinefish, which, have, large, external, spines, unlike, the, thinner, hidden, spines, of, the, tetraodontidae, which, are, only, visible, when, the, fish, have, puffed, up, the, majority, of, pufferfish, species, are, toxic, with, some, among, the, most, poisonous, vertebrates, in, the, world, in, certain, species, the, internal, organs, such, as, the, liver, and, sometimes, the, skin, contain, tetrodotoxin, and, are, highly, toxic, to, most, animals, when, eaten, nevertheless, the, meat, of, some, species, is, considered, a, delicacy, in, japan, as, pronounced, fugu, korea, as, bok, or, bogeo, and, china, as, h, t, n, when, prepared, by, specially, trained, chefs, who, know, which, part, is, safe, to, eat, and, in, what, quantity, other, pufferfish, species, with, nontoxic, flesh, such, as, the, northern, puffer, sphoeroides, maculatus, of, chesapeake, bay, are, considered, a, delicacy, elsewhere, the, species, torquigener, albomaculosus, was, described, by, david, attenborough, as, the, greatest, artist, of, the, animal, kingdom, due, to, the, males, unique, habit, of, wooing, females, by, creating, nests, in, sand, composed, of, complex, geometric, designs, the, family, name, comes, from, the, name, of, its, type, genus, tetraodon, it, is, traced, from, the, greek, words, tetra, meaning, four, and, odo, s, meaning, teeth, because, its, species, has, four, large, teeth, fused, into, upper, and, lower, plates, used, to, crush, the, hard, shells, of, crustaceans, and, mollusks, their, natural, prey, the, tetraodontidae, contain, 193, species, of, puffers, in, 28, genera, pufferfish, are, typically, small, to, medium, in, size, although, a, few, species, such, as, the, mbu, pufferfish, can, reach, lengths, greater, than, 50, cm, 20, in, tetraodontiformes, or, pufferfish, are, most, significantly, characterized, by, the, beak, like, four, teeth, hence, the, name, combining, the, greek, terms, tetra, for, four, and, odous, for, tooth, each, of, the, top, and, bottom, arches, is, fused, together, with, a, visible, midsagittal, demarcation, which, are, used, to, break, apart, and, consume, small, crustaceans, the, lack, of, ribs, a, pelvis, and, pectoral, fins, are, also, unique, to, pufferfish, the, notably, missing, bone, and, fin, features, are, due, to, the, pufferfish, specialized, defense, mechanism, expanding, by, sucking, in, water, through, an, oral, cavity, pufferfish, can, also, have, many, varied, structures, of, caltrop, like, dermal, spines, which, account, for, the, replacement, of, typical, fish, scales, and, can, range, in, coverage, extent, from, the, entire, body, to, leaving, the, frontal, surface, empty, tetraodontidae, typically, have, smaller, spines, than, the, sister, family, diodontidae, with, some, spines, not, being, visible, until, inflation, they, are, most, diverse, in, the, tropics, relatively, uncommon, in, the, temperate, zone, and, completely, absent, from, cold, waters, most, pufferfish, species, live, in, marine, or, brackish, waters, but, some, can, enter, fresh, water, about, 35, species, spend, their, entire, lifecycles, in, fresh, water, these, freshwater, species, are, found, in, disjunct, tropical, regions, of, south, america, colomesus, asellus, and, colomesus, tocantinensis, africa, six, tetraodon, species, and, southeast, asia, auriglobus, carinotetraodon, dichotomyctere, leiodon, and, pao, the, puffer, s, unique, and, distinctive, natural, defenses, help, compensate, for, its, slow, locomotion, it, moves, by, combining, pectoral, dorsal, anal, and, caudal, fin, motions, this, makes, it, highly, maneuverable, but, very, slow, so, a, comparatively, easy, predation, target, its, tail, fin, is, mainly, used, as, a, rudder, but, it, can, be, used, for, a, sudden, evasive, burst, of, speed, that, shows, none, of, the, care, and, precision, of, its, usual, movements, the, puffer, s, excellent, eyesight, combined, with, this, speed, burst, is, the, first, and, most, important, defense, against, predators, the, pufferfish, s, secondary, defense, mechanism, used, if, successfully, pursued, is, to, fill, its, extremely, elastic, stomach, with, water, or, air, when, outside, the, water, until, it, is, much, larger, and, almost, spherical, in, shape, even, if, they, are, not, visible, when, the, puffer, is, not, inflated, all, puffers, have, pointed, spines, so, a, hungry, predator, may, suddenly, find, itself, facing, an, unpalatable, pointy, ball, rather, than, a, slow, easy, meal, predators, that, do, not, heed, this, warning, or, are, lucky, enough, to, catch, the, puffer, suddenly, before, or, during, inflation, may, die, from, choking, and, predators, that, do, manage, to, swallow, the, puffer, may, find, their, stomachs, full, of, tetrodotoxin, ttx, making, puffers, an, unpleasant, possibly, lethal, choice, of, prey, this, neurotoxin, is, found, primarily, in, the, ovaries, and, liver, although, smaller, amounts, exist, in, the, intestines, and, skin, as, well, as, trace, amounts, in, muscle, it, does, not, always, have, a, lethal, effect, on, large, predators, such, as, sharks, but, it, can, kill, humans, larval, pufferfish, are, chemically, defended, by, the, presence, of, ttx, on, the, surface, of, skin, which, causes, predators, to, spit, them, out, not, all, puffers, are, necessarily, poisonous, the, flesh, of, the, northern, puffer, is, not, toxic, a, level, of, poison, can, be, found, in, its, viscera, and, it, is, considered, a, delicacy, in, north, america, toxin, level, varies, widely, even, in, fish, that, are, poisonous, a, puffer, s, neurotoxin, is, not, necessarily, as, toxic, to, other, animals, as, it, is, to, humans, and, puffers, are, eaten, routinely, by, some, species, of, fish, such, as, lizardfish, and, sharks, puffers, are, able, to, move, their, eyes, independently, and, many, species, can, change, the, color, or, intensity, of, their, patterns, in, response, to, environmental, changes, in, these, respects, they, are, somewhat, similar, to, the, terrestrial, chameleon, although, most, puffers, are, drab, many, have, bright, colors, and, distinctive, markings, and, make, no, attempt, to, hide, from, predators, this, is, likely, an, example, of, honestly, signaled, aposematism, dolphins, have, been, filmed, expertly, handling, pufferfish, amongst, themselves, in, an, apparent, attempt, to, get, intoxicated, or, enter, a, trance, like, state, many, marine, puffers, have, a, pelagic, or, open, ocean, life, stage, spawning, occurs, after, males, slowly, push, females, to, the, water, surface, or, join, females, already, present, the, eggs, are, spherical, and, buoyant, hatching, occurs, after, roughly, four, days, the, fry, are, tiny, but, under, magnification, have, a, shape, usually, reminiscent, of, a, pufferfish, they, have, a, functional, mouth, and, eyes, and, must, eat, within, a, few, days, brackish, water, puffers, may, breed, in, bays, in, a, manner, similar, to, marine, species, or, may, breed, more, similarly, to, the, freshwater, species, in, cases, where, they, have, moved, far, enough, upriver, reproduction, in, freshwater, species, varies, quite, a, bit, the, dwarf, puffers, court, with, males, following, females, possibly, displaying, the, crests, and, keels, unique, to, this, subgroup, of, species, after, the, female, accepts, his, advances, she, will, lead, the, male, into, plants, or, another, form, of, cover, where, she, can, release, eggs, for, fertilization, the, male, may, help, her, by, rubbing, against, her, side, this, has, been, observed, in, captivity, and, they, are, the, only, commonly, captive, spawned, puffer, species, target, group, puffers, have, also, been, spawned, in, aquaria, and, follow, a, similar, courting, behavior, minus, the, crest, keel, display, eggs, are, laid, though, on, a, flat, piece, of, slate, or, other, smooth, hard, material, to, which, they, adhere, the, male, will, guard, them, until, they, hatch, carefully, blowing, water, over, them, regularly, to, keep, the, eggs, healthy, his, parenting, is, finished, when, the, young, hatch, and, the, fry, are, on, their, own, in, 2012, males, of, the, species, torquigener, albomaculosus, were, documented, while, carving, large, and, complex, geometric, circular, structures, in, the, seabed, sand, in, amami, shima, japan, the, structures, serve, to, attract, females, and, to, provide, a, safe, place, for, them, to, lay, their, eggs, information, on, breeding, of, specific, species, is, very, limited, t, nigroviridis, the, green, spotted, puffer, has, recently, been, spawned, artificially, under, captive, conditions, it, is, believed, to, spawn, in, bays, in, a, similar, manner, to, saltwater, species, as, their, sperm, was, found, to, be, motile, only, at, full, marine, salinities, but, wild, breeding, has, never, been, observed, xenopterus, naritus, has, been, reported, to, be, the, first, bred, artificially, in, sarawak, northwestern, borneo, in, june, 2016, and, the, main, purpose, was, for, development, of, aquaculture, of, the, species, pufferfish, diets, can, vary, depending, on, their, environment, traditionally, their, diet, consists, mostly, of, algae, and, small, invertebrates, they, can, survive, on, a, completely, vegetarian, diet, if, their, environment, is, lacking, resources, but, prefer, an, omnivorous, food, selection, larger, species, of, pufferfish, are, able, to, use, their, beak, like, front, teeth, to, break, open, clams, mussels, and, other, shellfish, some, species, of, pufferfish, have, also, been, known, to, enact, various, hunting, techniques, ranging, from, ambush, to, open, water, hunting, the, tetraodontids, have, been, estimated, to, have, diverged, from, diodontids, between, 89, and, 138, million, years, ago, the, four, major, clades, diverged, during, the, cretaceous, between, 80, and, 101, million, years, ago, the, oldest, known, pufferfish, genus, is, eotetraodon, from, the, lutetian, epoch, of, middle, eocene, europe, with, fossils, found, in, monte, bolca, and, the, caucasus, mountains, the, monte, bolca, species, e, pygmaeus, coexisted, with, several, other, tetraodontiforms, including, an, extinct, species, of, diodontid, primitive, boxfish, proaracana, and, eolactoria, and, other, totally, extinct, forms, such, as, zignoichthys, and, the, spinacanthids, the, extinct, genus, archaeotetraodon, is, known, from, miocene, aged, fossils, from, europe, pufferfish, can, be, lethal, if, not, served, properly, puffer, poisoning, usually, results, from, consumption, of, incorrectly, prepared, puffer, soup, fugu, chiri, or, occasionally, from, raw, puffer, meat, sashimi, fugu, while, chiri, is, much, more, likely, to, cause, death, sashimi, fugu, often, causes, intoxication, light, headedness, and, numbness, of, the, lips, pufferfish, tetrodotoxin, deadens, the, tongue, and, lips, and, induces, dizziness, and, vomiting, followed, by, numbness, and, prickling, over, the, body, rapid, heart, rate, decreased, blood, pressure, and, muscle, paralysis, the, toxin, paralyzes, the, diaphragm, muscle, and, stops, the, person, who, has, ingested, it, from, breathing, people, who, live, longer, than, 24, hours, typically, survive, although, possibly, after, a, coma, lasting, several, days, the, source, of, tetrodotoxin, in, puffers, has, been, a, matter, of, debate, but, it, is, increasingly, accepted, that, bacteria, in, the, fish, s, intestinal, tract, are, the, source, saxitoxin, the, cause, of, paralytic, shellfish, poisoning, and, red, tide, can, also, be, found, in, certain, puffers, in, september, 2012, the, bureau, of, fisheries, and, aquatic, resources, in, the, philippines, issued, a, warning, not, to, eat, puffer, fish, after, local, fishermen, died, upon, consuming, puffer, fish, for, dinner, the, warning, indicated, that, puffer, fish, toxin, is, 100, times, more, potent, than, cyanide, pufferfish, called, pakapao, in, thailand, are, usually, consumed, by, mistake, they, are, often, cheaper, than, other, fish, and, because, they, contain, inconsistent, levels, of, toxins, between, fish, and, season, there, is, little, awareness, or, monitoring, of, the, danger, consumers, are, regularly, hospitalized, and, some, even, die, from, the, poisoning, cases, of, neurological, symptoms, including, numbness, and, tingling, of, the, lips, and, mouth, have, been, reported, to, rise, after, the, consumption, of, puffers, caught, in, the, area, of, titusville, florida, us, the, symptoms, generally, resolve, within, hours, to, days, although, one, affected, individual, required, intubation, for, 72, hours, as, a, result, florida, banned, the, harvesting, of, puffers, from, certain, bodies, of, water, treatment, is, mainly, supportive, and, consists, of, intestinal, decontamination, with, gastric, lavage, and, activated, charcoal, and, life, support, until, the, toxin, is, metabolized, case, reports, suggest, anticholinesterases, such, as, edrophonium, may, be, effective
