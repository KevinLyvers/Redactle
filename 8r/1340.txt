chemotherapy, often, abbreviated, chemo, sometimes, ctx, and, ctx, is, the, type, of, cancer, treatment, that, uses, one, or, more, anti, cancer, drugs, chemotherapeutic, agents, or, alkylating, agents, in, a, standard, regimen, chemotherapy, may, be, given, with, a, curative, intent, which, almost, always, involves, combinations, of, drugs, or, it, may, aim, only, to, prolong, life, or, to, reduce, symptoms, palliative, chemotherapy, chemotherapy, is, one, of, the, major, categories, of, the, medical, discipline, specifically, devoted, to, pharmacotherapy, for, cancer, which, is, called, medical, oncology, the, term, chemotherapy, now, means, the, non, specific, use, of, intracellular, poisons, to, inhibit, mitosis, cell, division, or, to, induce, dna, damage, so, that, dna, repair, can, augment, chemotherapy, this, meaning, excludes, the, more, selective, agents, that, block, extracellular, signals, signal, transduction, therapies, with, specific, molecular, or, genetic, targets, which, inhibit, growth, promoting, signals, from, classic, endocrine, hormones, primarily, estrogens, for, breast, cancer, and, androgens, for, prostate, cancer, are, now, called, hormonal, therapies, other, inhibitions, of, growth, signals, such, as, those, associated, with, receptor, tyrosine, kinases, are, targeted, therapy, the, use, of, drugs, whether, chemotherapy, hormonal, therapy, or, targeted, therapy, is, systemic, therapy, for, cancer, they, are, introduced, into, the, blood, stream, the, system, and, therefore, can, treat, cancer, anywhere, in, the, body, systemic, therapy, is, often, used, with, other, local, therapy, treatments, that, work, only, where, they, are, applied, such, as, radiation, surgery, and, hyperthermia, traditional, chemotherapeutic, agents, are, cytotoxic, by, means, of, interfering, with, cell, division, mitosis, but, cancer, cells, vary, widely, in, their, susceptibility, to, these, agents, to, a, large, extent, chemotherapy, can, be, thought, of, as, a, way, to, damage, or, stress, cells, which, may, then, lead, to, cell, death, if, apoptosis, is, initiated, many, of, the, side, effects, of, chemotherapy, can, be, traced, to, damage, to, normal, cells, that, divide, rapidly, and, are, thus, sensitive, to, anti, mitotic, drugs, cells, in, the, bone, marrow, digestive, tract, and, hair, follicles, this, results, in, the, most, common, side, effects, of, chemotherapy, myelosuppression, decreased, production, of, blood, cells, hence, that, also, immunosuppression, mucositis, inflammation, of, the, lining, of, the, digestive, tract, and, alopecia, hair, loss, because, of, the, effect, on, immune, cells, especially, lymphocytes, chemotherapy, drugs, often, find, use, in, a, host, of, diseases, that, result, from, harmful, overactivity, of, the, immune, system, against, self, so, called, autoimmunity, these, include, rheumatoid, arthritis, systemic, lupus, erythematosus, multiple, sclerosis, vasculitis, and, many, others, there, are, a, number, of, strategies, in, the, administration, of, chemotherapeutic, drugs, used, today, chemotherapy, may, be, given, with, a, curative, intent, or, it, may, aim, to, prolong, life, or, to, palliate, symptoms, all, chemotherapy, regimens, require, that, the, recipient, be, capable, of, undergoing, the, treatment, performance, status, is, often, used, as, a, measure, to, determine, whether, a, person, can, receive, chemotherapy, or, whether, dose, reduction, is, required, because, only, a, fraction, of, the, cells, in, a, tumor, die, with, each, treatment, fractional, kill, repeated, doses, must, be, administered, to, continue, to, reduce, the, size, of, the, tumor, current, chemotherapy, regimens, apply, drug, treatment, in, cycles, with, the, frequency, and, duration, of, treatments, limited, by, toxicity, the, effectiveness, of, chemotherapy, depends, on, the, type, of, cancer, and, the, stage, the, overall, effectiveness, ranges, from, being, curative, for, some, cancers, such, as, some, leukemias, to, being, ineffective, such, as, in, some, brain, tumors, to, being, needless, in, others, like, most, non, melanoma, skin, cancers, dosage, of, chemotherapy, can, be, difficult, if, the, dose, is, too, low, it, will, be, ineffective, against, the, tumor, whereas, at, excessive, doses, the, toxicity, side, effects, will, be, intolerable, to, the, person, receiving, it, the, standard, method, of, determining, chemotherapy, dosage, is, based, on, calculated, body, surface, area, bsa, the, bsa, is, usually, calculated, with, a, mathematical, formula, or, a, nomogram, using, the, recipient, s, weight, and, height, rather, than, by, direct, measurement, of, body, area, this, formula, was, originally, derived, in, a, 1916, study, and, attempted, to, translate, medicinal, doses, established, with, laboratory, animals, to, equivalent, doses, for, humans, the, study, only, included, nine, human, subjects, when, chemotherapy, was, introduced, in, the, 1950s, the, bsa, formula, was, adopted, as, the, official, standard, for, chemotherapy, dosing, for, lack, of, a, better, option, the, validity, of, this, method, in, calculating, uniform, doses, has, been, questioned, because, the, formula, only, takes, into, account, the, individual, s, weight, and, height, drug, absorption, and, clearance, are, influenced, by, multiple, factors, including, age, sex, metabolism, disease, state, organ, function, drug, to, drug, interactions, genetics, and, obesity, which, have, major, impacts, on, the, actual, concentration, of, the, drug, in, the, person, s, bloodstream, as, a, result, there, is, high, variability, in, the, systemic, chemotherapy, drug, concentration, in, people, dosed, by, bsa, and, this, variability, has, been, demonstrated, to, be, more, than, ten, fold, for, many, drugs, in, other, words, if, two, people, receive, the, same, dose, of, a, given, drug, based, on, bsa, the, concentration, of, that, drug, in, the, bloodstream, of, one, person, may, be, 10, times, higher, or, lower, compared, to, that, of, the, other, person, this, variability, is, typical, with, many, chemotherapy, drugs, dosed, by, bsa, and, as, shown, below, was, demonstrated, in, a, study, of, 14, common, chemotherapy, drugs, the, result, of, this, pharmacokinetic, variability, among, people, is, that, many, people, do, not, receive, the, right, dose, to, achieve, optimal, treatment, effectiveness, with, minimized, toxic, side, effects, some, people, are, overdosed, while, others, are, underdosed, for, example, in, a, randomized, clinical, trial, investigators, found, 85, of, metastatic, colorectal, cancer, patients, treated, with, 5, fluorouracil, 5, fu, did, not, receive, the, optimal, therapeutic, dose, when, dosed, by, the, bsa, standard, 68, were, underdosed, and, 17, were, overdosed, there, has, been, controversy, over, the, use, of, bsa, to, calculate, chemotherapy, doses, for, people, who, are, obese, because, of, their, higher, bsa, clinicians, often, arbitrarily, reduce, the, dose, prescribed, by, the, bsa, formula, for, fear, of, overdosing, in, many, cases, this, can, result, in, sub, optimal, treatment, several, clinical, studies, have, demonstrated, that, when, chemotherapy, dosing, is, individualized, to, achieve, optimal, systemic, drug, exposure, treatment, outcomes, are, improved, and, toxic, side, effects, are, reduced, in, the, 5, fu, clinical, study, cited, above, people, whose, dose, was, adjusted, to, achieve, a, pre, determined, target, exposure, realized, an, 84, improvement, in, treatment, response, rate, and, a, six, month, improvement, in, overall, survival, os, compared, with, those, dosed, by, bsa, in, the, same, study, investigators, compared, the, incidence, of, common, 5, fu, associated, grade, 3, 4, toxicities, between, the, dose, adjusted, people, and, people, dosed, per, bsa, the, incidence, of, debilitating, grades, of, diarrhea, was, reduced, from, 18, in, the, bsa, dosed, group, to, 4, in, the, dose, adjusted, group, and, serious, hematologic, side, effects, were, eliminated, because, of, the, reduced, toxicity, dose, adjusted, patients, were, able, to, be, treated, for, longer, periods, of, time, bsa, dosed, people, were, treated, for, a, total, of, 680, months, while, people, in, the, dose, adjusted, group, were, treated, for, a, total, of, 791, months, completing, the, course, of, treatment, is, an, important, factor, in, achieving, better, treatment, outcomes, similar, results, were, found, in, a, study, involving, people, with, colorectal, cancer, who, have, been, treated, with, the, popular, folfox, regimen, the, incidence, of, serious, diarrhea, was, reduced, from, 12, in, the, bsa, dosed, group, of, patients, to, 1, 7, in, the, dose, adjusted, group, and, the, incidence, of, severe, mucositis, was, reduced, from, 15, to, 0, 8, the, folfox, study, also, demonstrated, an, improvement, in, treatment, outcomes, positive, response, increased, from, 46, in, the, bsa, dosed, group, to, 70, in, the, dose, adjusted, group, median, progression, free, survival, pfs, and, overall, survival, os, both, improved, by, six, months, in, the, dose, adjusted, group, one, approach, that, can, help, clinicians, individualize, chemotherapy, dosing, is, to, measure, the, drug, levels, in, blood, plasma, over, time, and, adjust, dose, according, to, a, formula, or, algorithm, to, achieve, optimal, exposure, with, an, established, target, exposure, for, optimized, treatment, effectiveness, with, minimized, toxicities, dosing, can, be, personalized, to, achieve, target, exposure, and, optimal, results, for, each, person, such, an, algorithm, was, used, in, the, clinical, trials, cited, above, and, resulted, in, significantly, improved, treatment, outcomes, oncologists, are, already, individualizing, dosing, of, some, cancer, drugs, based, on, exposure, carboplatin, 4, and, busulfan, dosing, rely, upon, results, from, blood, tests, to, calculate, the, optimal, dose, for, each, person, simple, blood, tests, are, also, available, for, dose, optimization, of, methotrexate, 5, fu, paclitaxel, and, docetaxel, the, serum, albumin, level, immediately, prior, to, chemotherapy, administration, is, an, independent, prognostic, predictor, of, survival, in, various, cancer, types, alkylating, agents, are, the, oldest, group, of, chemotherapeutics, in, use, today, originally, derived, from, mustard, gas, used, in, world, war, i, there, are, now, many, types, of, alkylating, agents, in, use, they, are, so, named, because, of, their, ability, to, alkylate, many, molecules, including, proteins, rna, and, dna, this, ability, to, bind, covalently, to, dna, via, their, alkyl, group, is, the, primary, cause, for, their, anti, cancer, effects, dna, is, made, of, two, strands, and, the, molecules, may, either, bind, twice, to, one, strand, of, dna, intrastrand, crosslink, or, may, bind, once, to, both, strands, interstrand, crosslink, if, the, cell, tries, to, replicate, crosslinked, dna, during, cell, division, or, tries, to, repair, it, the, dna, strands, can, break, this, leads, to, a, form, of, programmed, cell, death, called, apoptosis, alkylating, agents, will, work, at, any, point, in, the, cell, cycle, and, thus, are, known, as, cell, cycle, independent, drugs, for, this, reason, the, effect, on, the, cell, is, dose, dependent, the, fraction, of, cells, that, die, is, directly, proportional, to, the, dose, of, drug, the, subtypes, of, alkylating, agents, are, the, nitrogen, mustards, nitrosoureas, tetrazines, aziridines, cisplatins, and, derivatives, and, non, classical, alkylating, agents, nitrogen, mustards, include, mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan, chlorambucil, ifosfamide, and, busulfan, nitrosoureas, include, n, nitroso, n, methylurea, mnu, carmustine, bcnu, lomustine, ccnu, and, semustine, meccnu, fotemustine, and, streptozotocin, tetrazines, include, dacarbazine, mitozolomide, and, temozolomide, aziridines, include, thiotepa, mytomycin, and, diaziquone, azq, cisplatin, and, derivatives, include, cisplatin, carboplatin, and, oxaliplatin, they, impair, cell, function, by, forming, covalent, bonds, with, the, amino, carboxyl, sulfhydryl, and, phosphate, groups, in, biologically, important, molecules, non, classical, alkylating, agents, include, procarbazine, and, hexamethylmelamine, anti, metabolites, are, a, group, of, molecules, that, impede, dna, and, rna, synthesis, many, of, them, have, a, similar, structure, to, the, building, blocks, of, dna, and, rna, the, building, blocks, are, nucleotides, a, molecule, comprising, a, nucleobase, a, sugar, and, a, phosphate, group, the, nucleobases, are, divided, into, purines, guanine, and, adenine, and, pyrimidines, cytosine, thymine, and, uracil, anti, metabolites, resemble, either, nucleobases, or, nucleosides, a, nucleotide, without, the, phosphate, group, but, have, altered, chemical, groups, these, drugs, exert, their, effect, by, either, blocking, the, enzymes, required, for, dna, synthesis, or, becoming, incorporated, into, dna, or, rna, by, inhibiting, the, enzymes, involved, in, dna, synthesis, they, prevent, mitosis, because, the, dna, cannot, duplicate, itself, also, after, misincorporation, of, the, molecules, into, dna, dna, damage, can, occur, and, programmed, cell, death, apoptosis, is, induced, unlike, alkylating, agents, anti, metabolites, are, cell, cycle, dependent, this, means, that, they, only, work, during, a, specific, part, of, the, cell, cycle, in, this, case, s, phase, the, dna, synthesis, phase, for, this, reason, at, a, certain, dose, the, effect, plateaus, and, proportionally, no, more, cell, death, occurs, with, increased, doses, subtypes, of, the, anti, metabolites, are, the, anti, folates, fluoropyrimidines, deoxynucleoside, analogues, and, thiopurines, the, anti, folates, include, methotrexate, and, pemetrexed, methotrexate, inhibits, dihydrofolate, reductase, dhfr, an, enzyme, that, regenerates, tetrahydrofolate, from, dihydrofolate, when, the, enzyme, is, inhibited, by, methotrexate, the, cellular, levels, of, folate, coenzymes, diminish, these, are, required, for, thymidylate, and, purine, production, which, are, both, essential, for, dna, synthesis, and, cell, division, 55, 59, 11, pemetrexed, is, another, anti, metabolite, that, affects, purine, and, pyrimidine, production, and, therefore, also, inhibits, dna, synthesis, it, primarily, inhibits, the, enzyme, thymidylate, synthase, but, also, has, effects, on, dhfr, aminoimidazole, carboxamide, ribonucleotide, formyltransferase, and, glycinamide, ribonucleotide, formyltransferase, the, fluoropyrimidines, include, fluorouracil, and, capecitabine, fluorouracil, is, a, nucleobase, analogue, that, is, metabolised, in, cells, to, form, at, least, two, active, products, 5, fluourouridine, monophosphate, fump, and, 5, fluoro, 2, deoxyuridine, 5, phosphate, fdump, fump, becomes, incorporated, into, rna, and, fdump, inhibits, the, enzyme, thymidylate, synthase, both, of, which, lead, to, cell, death, 11, capecitabine, is, a, prodrug, of, 5, fluorouracil, that, is, broken, down, in, cells, to, produce, the, active, drug, the, deoxynucleoside, analogues, include, cytarabine, gemcitabine, decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and, pentostatin, the, thiopurines, include, thioguanine, and, mercaptopurine, anti, microtubule, agents, are, plant, derived, chemicals, that, block, cell, division, by, preventing, microtubule, function, microtubules, are, an, important, cellular, structure, composed, of, two, proteins, tubulin, and, tubulin, they, are, hollow, rod, shaped, structures, that, are, required, for, cell, division, among, other, cellular, functions, microtubules, are, dynamic, structures, which, means, that, they, are, permanently, in, a, state, of, assembly, and, disassembly, vinca, alkaloids, and, taxanes, are, the, two, main, groups, of, anti, microtubule, agents, and, although, both, of, these, groups, of, drugs, cause, microtubule, dysfunction, their, mechanisms, of, action, are, completely, opposite, vinca, alkaloids, prevent, the, assembly, of, microtubules, whereas, taxanes, prevent, their, disassembly, by, doing, so, they, can, induce, mitotic, catastrophe, in, the, cancer, cells, following, this, cell, cycle, arrest, occurs, which, induces, programmed, cell, death, apoptosis, these, drugs, can, also, affect, blood, vessel, growth, an, essential, process, that, tumours, utilise, in, order, to, grow, and, metastasise, vinca, alkaloids, are, derived, from, the, madagascar, periwinkle, catharanthus, roseus, formerly, known, as, vinca, rosea, they, bind, to, specific, sites, on, tubulin, inhibiting, the, assembly, of, tubulin, into, microtubules, the, original, vinca, alkaloids, are, natural, products, that, include, vincristine, and, vinblastine, following, the, success, of, these, drugs, semi, synthetic, vinca, alkaloids, were, produced, vinorelbine, used, in, the, treatment, of, non, small, cell, lung, cancer, vindesine, and, vinflunine, these, drugs, are, cell, cycle, specific, they, bind, to, the, tubulin, molecules, in, s, phase, and, prevent, proper, microtubule, formation, required, for, m, phase, taxanes, are, natural, and, semi, synthetic, drugs, the, first, drug, of, their, class, paclitaxel, was, originally, extracted, from, taxus, brevifolia, the, pacific, yew, now, this, drug, and, another, in, this, class, docetaxel, are, produced, semi, synthetically, from, a, chemical, found, in, the, bark, of, another, yew, tree, taxus, baccata, podophyllotoxin, is, an, antineoplastic, lignan, obtained, primarily, from, the, american, mayapple, podophyllum, peltatum, and, himalayan, mayapple, sinopodophyllum, hexandrum, it, has, anti, microtubule, activity, and, its, mechanism, is, similar, to, that, of, vinca, alkaloids, in, that, they, bind, to, tubulin, inhibiting, microtubule, formation, podophyllotoxin, is, used, to, produce, two, other, drugs, with, different, mechanisms, of, action, etoposide, and, teniposide, topoisomerase, inhibitors, are, drugs, that, affect, the, activity, of, two, enzymes, topoisomerase, i, and, topoisomerase, ii, when, the, dna, double, strand, helix, is, unwound, during, dna, replication, or, transcription, for, example, the, adjacent, unopened, dna, winds, tighter, supercoils, like, opening, the, middle, of, a, twisted, rope, the, stress, caused, by, this, effect, is, in, part, aided, by, the, topoisomerase, enzymes, they, produce, single, or, double, strand, breaks, into, dna, reducing, the, tension, in, the, dna, strand, this, allows, the, normal, unwinding, of, dna, to, occur, during, replication, or, transcription, inhibition, of, topoisomerase, i, or, ii, interferes, with, both, of, these, processes, two, topoisomerase, i, inhibitors, irinotecan, and, topotecan, are, semi, synthetically, derived, from, camptothecin, which, is, obtained, from, the, chinese, ornamental, tree, camptotheca, acuminata, drugs, that, target, topoisomerase, ii, can, be, divided, into, two, groups, the, topoisomerase, ii, poisons, cause, increased, levels, enzymes, bound, to, dna, this, prevents, dna, replication, and, transcription, causes, dna, strand, breaks, and, leads, to, programmed, cell, death, apoptosis, these, agents, include, etoposide, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and, teniposide, the, second, group, catalytic, inhibitors, are, drugs, that, block, the, activity, of, topoisomerase, ii, and, therefore, prevent, dna, synthesis, and, translation, because, the, dna, cannot, unwind, properly, this, group, includes, novobiocin, merbarone, and, aclarubicin, which, also, have, other, significant, mechanisms, of, action, the, cytotoxic, antibiotics, are, a, varied, group, of, drugs, that, have, various, mechanisms, of, action, the, common, theme, that, they, share, in, their, chemotherapy, indication, is, that, they, interrupt, cell, division, the, most, important, subgroup, is, the, anthracyclines, and, the, bleomycins, other, prominent, examples, include, mitomycin, c, and, actinomycin, among, the, anthracyclines, doxorubicin, and, daunorubicin, were, the, first, and, were, obtained, from, the, bacterium, streptomyces, peucetius, derivatives, of, these, compounds, include, epirubicin, and, idarubicin, other, clinically, used, drugs, in, the, anthracycline, group, are, pirarubicin, aclarubicin, and, mitoxantrone, the, mechanisms, of, anthracyclines, include, dna, intercalation, molecules, insert, between, the, two, strands, of, dna, generation, of, highly, reactive, free, radicals, that, damage, intercellular, molecules, and, topoisomerase, inhibition, actinomycin, is, a, complex, molecule, that, intercalates, dna, and, prevents, rna, synthesis, bleomycin, a, glycopeptide, isolated, from, streptomyces, verticillus, also, intercalates, dna, but, produces, free, radicals, that, damage, dna, this, occurs, when, bleomycin, binds, to, a, metal, ion, becomes, chemically, reduced, and, reacts, with, oxygen, 87, mitomycin, is, a, cytotoxic, antibiotic, with, the, ability, to, alkylate, dna, most, chemotherapy, is, delivered, intravenously, although, a, number, of, agents, can, be, administered, orally, e, g, melphalan, busulfan, capecitabine, according, to, a, recent, 2016, systematic, review, oral, therapies, present, additional, challenges, for, patients, and, care, teams, to, maintain, and, support, adherence, to, treatment, plans, there, are, many, intravenous, methods, of, drug, delivery, known, as, vascular, access, devices, these, include, the, winged, infusion, device, peripheral, venous, catheter, midline, catheter, peripherally, inserted, central, catheter, picc, central, venous, catheter, and, implantable, port, the, devices, have, different, applications, regarding, duration, of, chemotherapy, treatment, method, of, delivery, and, types, of, chemotherapeutic, agent, 94, 95, depending, on, the, person, the, cancer, the, stage, of, cancer, the, type, of, chemotherapy, and, the, dosage, intravenous, chemotherapy, may, be, given, on, either, an, inpatient, or, an, outpatient, basis, for, continuous, frequent, or, prolonged, intravenous, chemotherapy, administration, various, systems, may, be, surgically, inserted, into, the, vasculature, to, maintain, access, 113, 118, commonly, used, systems, are, the, hickman, line, the, port, a, cath, and, the, picc, line, these, have, a, lower, infection, risk, are, much, less, prone, to, phlebitis, or, extravasation, and, eliminate, the, need, for, repeated, insertion, of, peripheral, cannulae, isolated, limb, perfusion, often, used, in, melanoma, or, isolated, infusion, of, chemotherapy, into, the, liver, or, the, lung, have, been, used, to, treat, some, tumors, the, main, purpose, of, these, approaches, is, to, deliver, a, very, high, dose, of, chemotherapy, to, tumor, sites, without, causing, overwhelming, systemic, damage, these, approaches, can, help, control, solitary, or, limited, metastases, but, they, are, by, definition, not, systemic, and, therefore, do, not, treat, distributed, metastases, or, micrometastases, topical, chemotherapies, such, as, 5, fluorouracil, are, used, to, treat, some, cases, of, non, melanoma, skin, cancer, if, the, cancer, has, central, nervous, system, involvement, or, with, meningeal, disease, intrathecal, chemotherapy, may, be, administered, chemotherapeutic, techniques, have, a, range, of, side, effects, that, depend, on, the, type, of, medications, used, the, most, common, medications, affect, mainly, the, fast, dividing, cells, of, the, body, such, as, blood, cells, and, the, cells, lining, the, mouth, stomach, and, intestines, chemotherapy, related, toxicities, can, occur, acutely, after, administration, within, hours, or, days, or, chronically, from, weeks, to, years, 265, virtually, all, chemotherapeutic, regimens, can, cause, depression, of, the, immune, system, often, by, paralysing, the, bone, marrow, and, leading, to, a, decrease, of, white, blood, cells, red, blood, cells, and, platelets, anemia, and, thrombocytopenia, may, require, blood, transfusion, neutropenia, a, decrease, of, the, neutrophil, granulocyte, count, below, 0, 5, x, 10, 9, litre, can, be, improved, with, synthetic, g, csf, granulocyte, colony, stimulating, factor, e, g, filgrastim, lenograstim, efbemalenograstim, alfa, in, very, severe, myelosuppression, which, occurs, in, some, regimens, almost, all, the, bone, marrow, stem, cells, cells, that, produce, white, and, red, blood, cells, are, destroyed, meaning, allogenic, or, autologous, bone, marrow, cell, transplants, are, necessary, in, autologous, bmts, cells, are, removed, from, the, person, before, the, treatment, multiplied, and, then, re, injected, afterward, in, allogenic, bmts, the, source, is, a, donor, however, some, people, still, develop, diseases, because, of, this, interference, with, bone, marrow, although, people, receiving, chemotherapy, are, encouraged, to, wash, their, hands, avoid, sick, people, and, take, other, infection, reducing, steps, about, 85, of, infections, are, due, to, naturally, occurring, microorganisms, in, the, person, s, own, gastrointestinal, tract, including, oral, cavity, and, skin, 130, this, may, manifest, as, systemic, infections, such, as, sepsis, or, as, localized, outbreaks, such, as, herpes, simplex, shingles, or, other, members, of, the, herpesviridea, the, risk, of, illness, and, death, can, be, reduced, by, taking, common, antibiotics, such, as, quinolones, or, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, before, any, fever, or, sign, of, infection, appears, quinolones, show, effective, prophylaxis, mainly, with, hematological, cancer, however, in, general, for, every, five, people, who, are, immunosuppressed, following, chemotherapy, who, take, an, antibiotic, one, fever, can, be, prevented, for, every, 34, who, take, an, antibiotic, one, death, can, be, prevented, sometimes, chemotherapy, treatments, are, postponed, because, the, immune, system, is, suppressed, to, a, critically, low, level, in, japan, the, government, has, approved, the, use, of, some, medicinal, mushrooms, like, trametes, versicolor, to, counteract, depression, of, the, immune, system, in, people, undergoing, chemotherapy, trilaciclib, is, an, inhibitor, of, cyclin, dependent, kinase, 4, 6, approved, for, the, prevention, of, myelosuppression, caused, by, chemotherapy, the, drug, is, given, before, chemotherapy, to, protect, bone, marrow, function, due, to, immune, system, suppression, neutropenic, enterocolitis, typhlitis, is, a, life, threatening, gastrointestinal, complication, of, chemotherapy, typhlitis, is, an, intestinal, infection, which, may, manifest, itself, through, symptoms, including, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, a, distended, abdomen, fever, chills, or, abdominal, pain, and, tenderness, typhlitis, is, a, medical, emergency, it, has, a, very, poor, prognosis, and, is, often, fatal, unless, promptly, recognized, and, aggressively, treated, successful, treatment, hinges, on, early, diagnosis, provided, by, a, high, index, of, suspicion, and, the, use, of, ct, scanning, nonoperative, treatment, for, uncomplicated, cases, and, sometimes, elective, right, hemicolectomy, to, prevent, recurrence, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, abdominal, cramps, and, constipation, are, common, side, effects, of, chemotherapeutic, medications, that, kill, fast, dividing, cells, malnutrition, and, dehydration, can, result, when, the, recipient, does, not, eat, or, drink, enough, or, when, the, person, vomits, frequently, because, of, gastrointestinal, damage, this, can, result, in, rapid, weight, loss, or, occasionally, in, weight, gain, if, the, person, eats, too, much, in, an, effort, to, allay, nausea, or, heartburn, weight, gain, can, also, be, caused, by, some, steroid, medications, these, side, effects, can, frequently, be, reduced, or, eliminated, with, antiemetic, drugs, low, certainty, evidence, also, suggests, that, probiotics, may, have, a, preventative, and, treatment, effect, of, diarrhoea, related, to, chemotherapy, alone, and, with, radiotherapy, however, a, high, index, of, suspicion, is, appropriate, since, diarrhoea, and, bloating, are, also, symptoms, of, typhlitis, a, very, serious, and, potentially, life, threatening, medical, emergency, that, requires, immediate, treatment, anemia, can, be, a, combined, outcome, caused, by, myelosuppressive, chemotherapy, and, possible, cancer, related, causes, such, as, bleeding, blood, cell, destruction, hemolysis, hereditary, disease, kidney, dysfunction, nutritional, deficiencies, or, anemia, of, chronic, disease, treatments, to, mitigate, anemia, include, hormones, to, boost, blood, production, erythropoietin, iron, supplements, and, blood, transfusions, myelosuppressive, therapy, can, cause, a, tendency, to, bleed, easily, leading, to, anemia, medications, that, kill, rapidly, dividing, cells, or, blood, cells, can, reduce, the, number, of, platelets, in, the, blood, which, can, result, in, bruises, and, bleeding, extremely, low, platelet, counts, may, be, temporarily, boosted, through, platelet, transfusions, and, new, drugs, to, increase, platelet, counts, during, chemotherapy, are, being, developed, sometimes, chemotherapy, treatments, are, postponed, to, allow, platelet, counts, to, recover, fatigue, may, be, a, consequence, of, the, cancer, or, its, treatment, and, can, last, for, months, to, years, after, treatment, one, physiological, cause, of, fatigue, is, anemia, which, can, be, caused, by, chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, primary, and, metastatic, disease, or, nutritional, depletion, aerobic, exercise, has, been, found, to, be, beneficial, in, reducing, fatigue, in, people, with, solid, tumours, nausea, and, vomiting, are, two, of, the, most, feared, cancer, treatment, related, side, effects, for, people, with, cancer, and, their, families, in, 1983, coates, et, al, found, that, people, receiving, chemotherapy, ranked, nausea, and, vomiting, as, the, first, and, second, most, severe, side, effects, respectively, up, to, 20, of, people, receiving, highly, emetogenic, agents, in, this, era, postponed, or, even, refused, potentially, curative, treatments, chemotherapy, induced, nausea, and, vomiting, cinv, are, common, with, many, treatments, and, some, forms, of, cancer, since, the, 1990s, several, novel, classes, of, antiemetics, have, been, developed, and, commercialized, becoming, a, nearly, universal, standard, in, chemotherapy, regimens, and, helping, to, successfully, manage, these, symptoms, in, many, people, effective, mediation, of, these, unpleasant, and, sometimes, debilitating, symptoms, results, in, increased, quality, of, life, for, the, recipient, and, more, efficient, treatment, cycles, due, to, less, stoppage, of, treatment, due, to, better, tolerance, and, better, overall, health, hair, loss, alopecia, can, be, caused, by, chemotherapy, that, kills, rapidly, dividing, cells, other, medications, may, cause, hair, to, thin, these, are, most, often, temporary, effects, hair, usually, starts, to, regrow, a, few, weeks, after, the, last, treatment, but, sometimes, with, a, change, in, color, texture, thickness, or, style, sometimes, hair, has, a, tendency, to, curl, after, regrowth, resulting, in, chemo, curls, severe, hair, loss, occurs, most, often, with, drugs, such, as, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and, etoposide, permanent, thinning, or, hair, loss, can, result, from, some, standard, chemotherapy, regimens, chemotherapy, induced, hair, loss, occurs, by, a, non, androgenic, mechanism, and, can, manifest, as, alopecia, totalis, telogen, effluvium, or, less, often, alopecia, areata, it, is, usually, associated, with, systemic, treatment, due, to, the, high, mitotic, rate, of, hair, follicles, and, more, reversible, than, androgenic, hair, loss, although, permanent, cases, can, occur, chemotherapy, induces, hair, loss, in, women, more, often, than, men, scalp, cooling, offers, a, means, of, preventing, both, permanent, and, temporary, hair, loss, however, concerns, about, this, method, have, been, raised, development, of, secondary, neoplasia, after, successful, chemotherapy, or, radiotherapy, treatment, can, occur, the, most, common, secondary, neoplasm, is, secondary, acute, myeloid, leukemia, which, develops, primarily, after, treatment, with, alkylating, agents, or, topoisomerase, inhibitors, survivors, of, childhood, cancer, are, more, than, 13, times, as, likely, to, get, a, secondary, neoplasm, during, the, 30, years, after, treatment, than, the, general, population, not, all, of, this, increase, can, be, attributed, to, chemotherapy, some, types, of, chemotherapy, are, gonadotoxic, and, may, cause, infertility, chemotherapies, with, high, risk, include, procarbazine, and, other, alkylating, drugs, such, as, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, busulfan, melphalan, chlorambucil, and, chlormethine, drugs, with, medium, risk, include, doxorubicin, and, platinum, analogs, such, as, cisplatin, and, carboplatin, on, the, other, hand, therapies, with, low, risk, of, gonadotoxicity, include, plant, derivatives, such, as, vincristine, and, vinblastine, antibiotics, such, as, bleomycin, and, dactinomycin, and, antimetabolites, such, as, methotrexate, mercaptopurine, and, 5, fluorouracil, female, infertility, by, chemotherapy, appears, to, be, secondary, to, premature, ovarian, failure, by, loss, of, primordial, follicles, this, loss, is, not, necessarily, a, direct, effect, of, the, chemotherapeutic, agents, but, could, be, due, to, an, increased, rate, of, growth, initiation, to, replace, damaged, developing, follicles, people, may, choose, between, several, methods, of, fertility, preservation, prior, to, chemotherapy, including, cryopreservation, of, semen, ovarian, tissue, oocytes, or, embryos, as, more, than, half, of, cancer, patients, are, elderly, this, adverse, effect, is, only, relevant, for, a, minority, of, patients, a, study, in, france, between, 1999, and, 2011, came, to, the, result, that, embryo, freezing, before, administration, of, gonadotoxic, agents, to, females, caused, a, delay, of, treatment, in, 34, of, cases, and, a, live, birth, in, 27, of, surviving, cases, who, wanted, to, become, pregnant, with, the, follow, up, time, varying, between, 1, and, 13, years, potential, protective, or, attenuating, agents, include, gnrh, analogs, where, several, studies, have, shown, a, protective, effect, in, vivo, in, humans, but, some, studies, show, no, such, effect, sphingosine, 1, phosphate, s1p, has, shown, similar, effect, but, its, mechanism, of, inhibiting, the, sphingomyelin, apoptotic, pathway, may, also, interfere, with, the, apoptosis, action, of, chemotherapy, drugs, in, chemotherapy, as, a, conditioning, regimen, in, hematopoietic, stem, cell, transplantation, a, study, of, people, conditioned, with, cyclophosphamide, alone, for, severe, aplastic, anemia, came, to, the, result, that, ovarian, recovery, occurred, in, all, women, younger, than, 26, years, at, time, of, transplantation, but, only, in, five, of, 16, women, older, than, 26, years, chemotherapy, is, teratogenic, during, pregnancy, especially, during, the, first, trimester, to, the, extent, that, abortion, usually, is, recommended, if, pregnancy, in, this, period, is, found, during, chemotherapy, second, and, third, trimester, exposure, does, not, usually, increase, the, teratogenic, risk, and, adverse, effects, on, cognitive, development, but, it, may, increase, the, risk, of, various, complications, of, pregnancy, and, fetal, myelosuppression, female, patients, of, reproductive, potential, should, use, effective, contraception, during, chemotherapy, and, for, a, few, months, after, the, last, dose, e, g, 6, month, for, doxorubicin, in, males, previously, having, undergone, chemotherapy, or, radiotherapy, there, appears, to, be, no, increase, in, genetic, defects, or, congenital, malformations, in, their, children, conceived, after, therapy, the, use, of, assisted, reproductive, technologies, and, micromanipulation, techniques, might, increase, this, risk, in, females, previously, having, undergone, chemotherapy, miscarriage, and, congenital, malformations, are, not, increased, in, subsequent, conceptions, however, when, in, vitro, fertilization, and, embryo, cryopreservation, is, practised, between, or, shortly, after, treatment, possible, genetic, risks, to, the, growing, oocytes, exist, and, hence, it, has, been, recommended, that, the, babies, be, screened, between, 30, and, 40, percent, of, people, undergoing, chemotherapy, experience, chemotherapy, induced, peripheral, neuropathy, cipn, a, progressive, enduring, and, often, irreversible, condition, causing, pain, tingling, numbness, and, sensitivity, to, cold, beginning, in, the, hands, and, feet, and, sometimes, progressing, to, the, arms, and, legs, chemotherapy, drugs, associated, with, cipn, include, thalidomide, epothilones, vinca, alkaloids, taxanes, proteasome, inhibitors, and, the, platinum, based, drugs, whether, cipn, arises, and, to, what, degree, is, determined, by, the, choice, of, drug, duration, of, use, the, total, amount, consumed, and, whether, the, person, already, has, peripheral, neuropathy, though, the, symptoms, are, mainly, sensory, in, some, cases, motor, nerves, and, the, autonomic, nervous, system, are, affected, cipn, often, follows, the, first, chemotherapy, dose, and, increases, in, severity, as, treatment, continues, but, this, progression, usually, levels, off, at, completion, of, treatment, the, platinum, based, drugs, are, the, exception, with, these, drugs, sensation, may, continue, to, deteriorate, for, several, months, after, the, end, of, treatment, some, cipn, appears, to, be, irreversible, pain, can, often, be, managed, with, drug, or, other, treatment, but, the, numbness, is, usually, resistant, to, treatment, some, people, receiving, chemotherapy, report, fatigue, or, non, specific, neurocognitive, problems, such, as, an, inability, to, concentrate, this, is, sometimes, called, post, chemotherapy, cognitive, impairment, referred, to, as, chemo, brain, in, popular, and, social, media, in, particularly, large, tumors, and, cancers, with, high, white, cell, counts, such, as, lymphomas, teratomas, and, some, leukemias, some, people, develop, tumor, lysis, syndrome, the, rapid, breakdown, of, cancer, cells, causes, the, release, of, chemicals, from, the, inside, of, the, cells, following, this, high, levels, of, uric, acid, potassium, and, phosphate, are, found, in, the, blood, high, levels, of, phosphate, induce, secondary, hypoparathyroidism, resulting, in, low, levels, of, calcium, in, the, blood, this, causes, kidney, damage, and, the, high, levels, of, potassium, can, cause, cardiac, arrhythmia, although, prophylaxis, is, available, and, is, often, initiated, in, people, with, large, tumors, this, is, a, dangerous, side, effect, that, can, lead, to, death, if, left, untreated, 202, cardiotoxicity, heart, damage, is, especially, prominent, with, the, use, of, anthracycline, drugs, doxorubicin, epirubicin, idarubicin, and, liposomal, doxorubicin, the, cause, of, this, is, most, likely, due, to, the, production, of, free, radicals, in, the, cell, and, subsequent, dna, damage, other, chemotherapeutic, agents, that, cause, cardiotoxicity, but, at, a, lower, incidence, are, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, and, clofarabine, hepatotoxicity, liver, damage, can, be, caused, by, many, cytotoxic, drugs, the, susceptibility, of, an, individual, to, liver, damage, can, be, altered, by, other, factors, such, as, the, cancer, itself, viral, hepatitis, immunosuppression, and, nutritional, deficiency, the, liver, damage, can, consist, of, damage, to, liver, cells, hepatic, sinusoidal, syndrome, obstruction, of, the, veins, in, the, liver, cholestasis, where, bile, does, not, flow, from, the, liver, to, the, intestine, and, liver, fibrosis, nephrotoxicity, kidney, damage, can, be, caused, by, tumor, lysis, syndrome, and, also, due, direct, effects, of, drug, clearance, by, the, kidneys, different, drugs, will, affect, different, parts, of, the, kidney, and, the, toxicity, may, be, asymptomatic, only, seen, on, blood, or, urine, tests, or, may, cause, acute, kidney, injury, ototoxicity, damage, to, the, inner, ear, is, a, common, side, effect, of, platinum, based, drugs, that, can, produce, symptoms, such, as, dizziness, and, vertigo, children, treated, with, platinum, analogues, have, been, found, to, be, at, risk, for, developing, hearing, loss, less, common, side, effects, include, red, skin, erythema, dry, skin, damaged, fingernails, a, dry, mouth, xerostomia, water, retention, and, sexual, impotence, some, medications, can, trigger, allergic, or, pseudoallergic, reactions, specific, chemotherapeutic, agents, are, associated, with, organ, specific, toxicities, including, cardiovascular, disease, e, g, doxorubicin, interstitial, lung, disease, e, g, bleomycin, and, occasionally, secondary, neoplasm, e, g, mopp, therapy, for, hodgkin, s, disease, hand, foot, syndrome, is, another, side, effect, to, cytotoxic, chemotherapy, nutritional, problems, are, also, frequently, seen, in, cancer, patients, at, diagnosis, and, through, chemotherapy, treatment, research, suggests, that, in, children, and, young, people, undergoing, cancer, treatment, parenteral, nutrition, may, help, with, this, leading, to, weight, gain, and, increased, calorie, and, protein, intake, when, compared, to, enteral, nutrition, chemotherapy, does, not, always, work, and, even, when, it, is, useful, it, may, not, completely, destroy, the, cancer, people, frequently, fail, to, understand, its, limitations, in, one, study, of, people, who, had, been, newly, diagnosed, with, incurable, stage, 4, cancer, more, than, two, thirds, of, people, with, lung, cancer, and, more, than, four, fifths, of, people, with, colorectal, cancer, still, believed, that, chemotherapy, was, likely, to, cure, their, cancer, the, blood, brain, barrier, poses, an, obstacle, to, delivery, of, chemotherapy, to, the, brain, this, is, because, the, brain, has, an, extensive, system, in, place, to, protect, it, from, harmful, chemicals, drug, transporters, can, pump, out, drugs, from, the, brain, and, brain, s, blood, vessel, cells, into, the, cerebrospinal, fluid, and, blood, circulation, these, transporters, pump, out, most, chemotherapy, drugs, which, reduces, their, efficacy, for, treatment, of, brain, tumors, only, small, lipophilic, alkylating, agents, such, as, lomustine, or, temozolomide, are, able, to, cross, this, blood, brain, barrier, blood, vessels, in, tumors, are, very, different, from, those, seen, in, normal, tissues, as, a, tumor, grows, tumor, cells, furthest, away, from, the, blood, vessels, become, low, in, oxygen, hypoxic, to, counteract, this, they, then, signal, for, new, blood, vessels, to, grow, the, newly, formed, tumor, vasculature, is, poorly, formed, and, does, not, deliver, an, adequate, blood, supply, to, all, areas, of, the, tumor, this, leads, to, issues, with, drug, delivery, because, many, drugs, will, be, delivered, to, the, tumor, by, the, circulatory, system, resistance, is, a, major, cause, of, treatment, failure, in, chemotherapeutic, drugs, there, are, a, few, possible, causes, of, resistance, in, cancer, one, of, which, is, the, presence, of, small, pumps, on, the, surface, of, cancer, cells, that, actively, move, chemotherapy, from, inside, the, cell, to, the, outside, cancer, cells, produce, high, amounts, of, these, pumps, known, as, p, glycoprotein, in, order, to, protect, themselves, from, chemotherapeutics, research, on, p, glycoprotein, and, other, such, chemotherapy, efflux, pumps, is, currently, ongoing, medications, to, inhibit, the, function, of, p, glycoprotein, are, undergoing, investigation, but, due, to, toxicities, and, interactions, with, anti, cancer, drugs, their, development, has, been, difficult, another, mechanism, of, resistance, is, gene, amplification, a, process, in, which, multiple, copies, of, a, gene, are, produced, by, cancer, cells, this, overcomes, the, effect, of, drugs, that, reduce, the, expression, of, genes, involved, in, replication, with, more, copies, of, the, gene, the, drug, can, not, prevent, all, expression, of, the, gene, and, therefore, the, cell, can, restore, its, proliferative, ability, cancer, cells, can, also, cause, defects, in, the, cellular, pathways, of, apoptosis, programmed, cell, death, as, most, chemotherapy, drugs, kill, cancer, cells, in, this, manner, defective, apoptosis, allows, survival, of, these, cells, making, them, resistant, many, chemotherapy, drugs, also, cause, dna, damage, which, can, be, repaired, by, enzymes, in, the, cell, that, carry, out, dna, repair, upregulation, of, these, genes, can, overcome, the, dna, damage, and, prevent, the, induction, of, apoptosis, mutations, in, genes, that, produce, drug, target, proteins, such, as, tubulin, can, occur, which, prevent, the, drugs, from, binding, to, the, protein, leading, to, resistance, to, these, types, of, drugs, drugs, used, in, chemotherapy, can, induce, cell, stress, which, can, kill, a, cancer, cell, however, under, certain, conditions, cells, stress, can, induce, changes, in, gene, expression, that, enables, resistance, to, several, types, of, drugs, in, lung, cancer, the, transcription, factor, nf, b, is, thought, to, play, a, role, in, resistance, to, chemotherapy, via, inflammatory, pathways, targeted, therapies, are, a, relatively, new, class, of, cancer, drugs, that, can, overcome, many, of, the, issues, seen, with, the, use, of, cytotoxics, they, are, divided, into, two, groups, small, molecule, and, antibodies, the, massive, toxicity, seen, with, the, use, of, cytotoxics, is, due, to, the, lack, of, cell, specificity, of, the, drugs, they, will, kill, any, rapidly, dividing, cell, tumor, or, normal, targeted, therapies, are, designed, to, affect, cellular, proteins, or, processes, that, are, utilised, by, the, cancer, cells, this, allows, a, high, dose, to, cancer, tissues, with, a, relatively, low, dose, to, other, tissues, although, the, side, effects, are, often, less, severe, than, that, seen, of, cytotoxic, chemotherapeutics, life, threatening, effects, can, occur, initially, the, targeted, therapeutics, were, supposed, to, be, solely, selective, for, one, protein, now, it, is, clear, that, there, is, often, a, range, of, protein, targets, that, the, drug, can, bind, an, example, target, for, targeted, therapy, is, the, bcr, abl1, protein, produced, from, the, philadelphia, chromosome, a, genetic, lesion, found, commonly, in, chronic, myelogenous, leukemia, and, in, some, patients, with, acute, lymphoblastic, leukemia, this, fusion, protein, has, enzyme, activity, that, can, be, inhibited, by, imatinib, a, small, molecule, drug, cancer, is, the, uncontrolled, growth, of, cells, coupled, with, malignant, behaviour, invasion, and, metastasis, among, other, features, it, is, caused, by, the, interaction, between, genetic, susceptibility, and, environmental, factors, these, factors, lead, to, accumulations, of, genetic, mutations, in, oncogenes, genes, that, control, the, growth, rate, of, cells, and, tumor, suppressor, genes, genes, that, help, to, prevent, cancer, which, gives, cancer, cells, their, malignant, characteristics, such, as, uncontrolled, growth, 93, 94, in, the, broad, sense, most, chemotherapeutic, drugs, work, by, impairing, mitosis, cell, division, effectively, targeting, fast, dividing, cells, as, these, drugs, cause, damage, to, cells, they, are, termed, cytotoxic, they, prevent, mitosis, by, various, mechanisms, including, damaging, dna, and, inhibition, of, the, cellular, machinery, involved, in, cell, division, one, theory, as, to, why, these, drugs, kill, cancer, cells, is, that, they, induce, a, programmed, form, of, cell, death, known, as, apoptosis, as, chemotherapy, affects, cell, division, tumors, with, high, growth, rates, such, as, acute, myelogenous, leukemia, and, the, aggressive, lymphomas, including, hodgkin, s, disease, are, more, sensitive, to, chemotherapy, as, a, larger, proportion, of, the, targeted, cells, are, undergoing, cell, division, at, any, time, malignancies, with, slower, growth, rates, such, as, indolent, lymphomas, tend, to, respond, to, chemotherapy, much, more, modestly, heterogeneic, tumours, may, also, display, varying, sensitivities, to, chemotherapy, agents, depending, on, the, subclonal, populations, within, the, tumor, cells, from, the, immune, system, also, make, crucial, contributions, to, the, antitumor, effects, of, chemotherapy, for, example, the, chemotherapeutic, drugs, oxaliplatin, and, cyclophosphamide, can, cause, tumor, cells, to, die, in, a, way, that, is, detectable, by, the, immune, system, called, immunogenic, cell, death, which, mobilizes, immune, cells, with, antitumor, functions, chemotherapeutic, drugs, that, cause, cancer, immunogenic, tumor, cell, death, can, make, unresponsive, tumors, sensitive, to, immune, checkpoint, therapy, some, chemotherapy, drugs, are, used, in, diseases, other, than, cancer, such, as, in, autoimmune, disorders, and, noncancerous, plasma, cell, dyscrasia, in, some, cases, they, are, often, used, at, lower, doses, which, means, that, the, side, effects, are, minimized, while, in, other, cases, doses, similar, to, ones, used, to, treat, cancer, are, used, methotrexate, is, used, in, the, treatment, of, rheumatoid, arthritis, ra, psoriasis, ankylosing, spondylitis, and, multiple, sclerosis, the, anti, inflammatory, response, seen, in, ra, is, thought, to, be, due, to, increases, in, adenosine, which, causes, immunosuppression, effects, on, immuno, regulatory, cyclooxygenase, 2, enzyme, pathways, reduction, in, pro, inflammatory, cytokines, and, anti, proliferative, properties, although, methotrexate, is, used, to, treat, both, multiple, sclerosis, and, ankylosing, spondylitis, its, efficacy, in, these, diseases, is, still, uncertain, cyclophosphamide, is, sometimes, used, to, treat, lupus, nephritis, a, common, symptom, of, systemic, lupus, erythematosus, dexamethasone, along, with, either, bortezomib, or, melphalan, is, commonly, used, as, a, treatment, for, al, amyloidosis, recently, bortezomid, in, combination, with, cyclophosphamide, and, dexamethasone, has, also, shown, promise, as, a, treatment, for, al, amyloidosis, other, drugs, used, to, treat, myeloma, such, as, lenalidomide, have, shown, promise, in, treating, al, amyloidosis, chemotherapy, drugs, are, also, used, in, conditioning, regimens, prior, to, bone, marrow, transplant, hematopoietic, stem, cell, transplant, conditioning, regimens, are, used, to, suppress, the, recipient, s, immune, system, in, order, to, allow, a, transplant, to, engraft, cyclophosphamide, is, a, common, cytotoxic, drug, used, in, this, manner, and, is, often, used, in, conjunction, with, total, body, irradiation, chemotherapeutic, drugs, may, be, used, at, high, doses, to, permanently, remove, the, recipient, s, bone, marrow, cells, myeloablative, conditioning, or, at, lower, doses, that, will, prevent, permanent, bone, marrow, loss, non, myeloablative, and, reduced, intensity, conditioning, when, used, in, non, cancer, setting, the, treatment, is, still, called, chemotherapy, and, is, often, done, in, the, same, treatment, centers, used, for, people, with, cancer, in, the, 1970s, antineoplastic, chemotherapy, drugs, were, identified, as, hazardous, and, the, american, society, of, health, system, pharmacists, ashp, has, since, then, introduced, the, concept, of, hazardous, drugs, after, publishing, a, recommendation, in, 1983, regarding, handling, hazardous, drugs, the, adaptation, of, federal, regulations, came, when, the, u, s, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, first, released, its, guidelines, in, 1986, and, then, updated, them, in, 1996, 1999, and, most, recently, 2006, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, been, conducting, an, assessment, in, the, workplace, since, then, regarding, these, drugs, occupational, exposure, to, antineoplastic, drugs, has, been, linked, to, multiple, health, effects, including, infertility, and, possible, carcinogenic, effects, a, few, cases, have, been, reported, by, the, niosh, alert, report, such, as, one, in, which, a, female, pharmacist, was, diagnosed, with, papillary, transitional, cell, carcinoma, twelve, years, before, the, pharmacist, was, diagnosed, with, the, condition, she, had, worked, for, 20, months, in, a, hospital, where, she, was, responsible, for, preparing, multiple, antineoplastic, drugs, the, pharmacist, did, not, have, any, other, risk, factor, for, cancer, and, therefore, her, cancer, was, attributed, to, the, exposure, to, the, antineoplastic, drugs, although, a, cause, and, effect, relationship, has, not, been, established, in, the, literature, another, case, happened, when, a, malfunction, in, biosafety, cabinetry, is, believed, to, have, exposed, nursing, personnel, to, antineoplastic, drugs, investigations, revealed, evidence, of, genotoxic, biomarkers, two, and, nine, months, after, that, exposure, antineoplastic, drugs, are, usually, given, through, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, or, subcutaneous, administration, in, most, cases, before, the, medication, is, administered, to, the, patient, it, needs, to, be, prepared, and, handled, by, several, workers, any, worker, who, is, involved, in, handling, preparing, or, administering, the, drugs, or, with, cleaning, objects, that, have, come, into, contact, with, antineoplastic, drugs, is, potentially, exposed, to, hazardous, drugs, health, care, workers, are, exposed, to, drugs, in, different, circumstances, such, as, when, pharmacists, and, pharmacy, technicians, prepare, and, handle, antineoplastic, drugs, and, when, nurses, and, physicians, administer, the, drugs, to, patients, additionally, those, who, are, responsible, for, disposing, antineoplastic, drugs, in, health, care, facilities, are, also, at, risk, of, exposure, dermal, exposure, is, thought, to, be, the, main, route, of, exposure, due, to, the, fact, that, significant, amounts, of, the, antineoplastic, agents, have, been, found, in, the, gloves, worn, by, healthcare, workers, who, prepare, handle, and, administer, the, agents, another, noteworthy, route, of, exposure, is, inhalation, of, the, drugs, vapors, multiple, studies, have, investigated, inhalation, as, a, route, of, exposure, and, although, air, sampling, has, not, shown, any, dangerous, levels, it, is, still, a, potential, route, of, exposure, ingestion, by, hand, to, mouth, is, a, route, of, exposure, that, is, less, likely, compared, to, others, because, of, the, enforced, hygienic, standard, in, the, health, institutions, however, it, is, still, a, potential, route, especially, in, the, workplace, outside, of, a, health, institute, one, can, also, be, exposed, to, these, hazardous, drugs, through, injection, by, needle, sticks, research, conducted, in, this, area, has, established, that, occupational, exposure, occurs, by, examining, evidence, in, multiple, urine, samples, from, health, care, workers, hazardous, drugs, expose, health, care, workers, to, serious, health, risks, many, studies, show, that, antineoplastic, drugs, could, have, many, side, effects, on, the, reproductive, system, such, as, fetal, loss, congenital, malformation, and, infertility, health, care, workers, who, are, exposed, to, antineoplastic, drugs, on, many, occasions, have, adverse, reproductive, outcomes, such, as, spontaneous, abortions, stillbirths, and, congenital, malformations, moreover, studies, have, shown, that, exposure, to, these, drugs, leads, to, menstrual, cycle, irregularities, antineoplastic, drugs, may, also, increase, the, risk, of, learning, disabilities, among, children, of, health, care, workers, who, are, exposed, to, these, hazardous, substances, moreover, these, drugs, have, carcinogenic, effects, in, the, past, five, decades, multiple, studies, have, shown, the, carcinogenic, effects, of, exposure, to, antineoplastic, drugs, similarly, there, have, been, research, studies, that, linked, alkylating, agents, with, humans, developing, leukemias, studies, have, reported, elevated, risk, of, breast, cancer, nonmelanoma, skin, cancer, and, cancer, of, the, rectum, among, nurses, who, are, exposed, to, these, drugs, other, investigations, revealed, that, there, is, a, potential, genotoxic, effect, from, anti, neoplastic, drugs, to, workers, in, health, care, settings, as, of, 2018, there, were, no, occupational, exposure, limits, set, for, antineoplastic, drugs, i, e, osha, or, the, american, conference, of, governmental, industrial, hygienists, acgih, have, not, set, workplace, safety, guidelines, niosh, recommends, using, a, ventilated, cabinet, that, is, designed, to, decrease, worker, exposure, additionally, it, recommends, training, of, all, staff, the, use, of, cabinets, implementing, an, initial, evaluation, of, the, technique, of, the, safety, program, and, wearing, protective, gloves, and, gowns, when, opening, drug, packaging, handling, vials, or, labeling, when, wearing, personal, protective, equipment, one, should, inspect, gloves, for, physical, defects, before, use, and, always, wear, double, gloves, and, protective, gowns, health, care, workers, are, also, required, to, wash, their, hands, with, water, and, soap, before, and, after, working, with, antineoplastic, drugs, change, gloves, every, 30, minutes, or, whenever, punctured, and, discard, them, immediately, in, a, chemotherapy, waste, container, the, gowns, used, should, be, disposable, gowns, made, of, polyethylene, coated, polypropylene, when, wearing, gowns, individuals, should, make, sure, that, the, gowns, are, closed, and, have, long, sleeves, when, preparation, is, done, the, final, product, should, be, completely, sealed, in, a, plastic, bag, the, health, care, worker, should, also, wipe, all, waste, containers, inside, the, ventilated, cabinet, before, removing, them, from, the, cabinet, finally, workers, should, remove, all, protective, wear, and, put, them, in, a, bag, for, their, disposal, inside, the, ventilated, cabinet, drugs, should, only, be, administered, using, protective, medical, devices, such, as, needle, lists, and, closed, systems, and, techniques, such, as, priming, of, iv, tubing, by, pharmacy, personnel, inside, a, ventilated, cabinet, workers, should, always, wear, personal, protective, equipment, such, as, double, gloves, goggles, and, protective, gowns, when, opening, the, outer, bag, and, assembling, the, delivery, system, to, deliver, the, drug, to, the, patient, and, when, disposing, of, all, material, used, in, the, administration, of, the, drugs, hospital, workers, should, never, remove, tubing, from, an, iv, bag, that, contains, an, antineoplastic, drug, and, when, disconnecting, the, tubing, in, the, system, they, should, make, sure, the, tubing, has, been, thoroughly, flushed, after, removing, the, iv, bag, the, workers, should, place, it, together, with, other, disposable, items, directly, in, the, yellow, chemotherapy, waste, container, with, the, lid, closed, protective, equipment, should, be, removed, and, put, into, a, disposable, chemotherapy, waste, container, after, this, has, been, done, one, should, double, bag, the, chemotherapy, waste, before, or, after, removing, one, s, inner, gloves, moreover, one, must, always, wash, one, s, hands, with, soap, and, water, before, leaving, the, drug, administration, site, all, employees, whose, jobs, in, health, care, facilities, expose, them, to, hazardous, drugs, must, receive, training, training, should, include, shipping, and, receiving, personnel, housekeepers, pharmacists, assistants, and, all, individuals, involved, in, the, transportation, and, storage, of, antineoplastic, drugs, these, individuals, should, receive, information, and, training, to, inform, them, of, the, hazards, of, the, drugs, present, in, their, areas, of, work, they, should, be, informed, and, trained, on, operations, and, procedures, in, their, work, areas, where, they, can, encounter, hazards, different, methods, used, to, detect, the, presence, of, hazardous, drugs, and, how, the, hazards, are, released, and, the, physical, and, health, hazards, of, the, drugs, including, their, reproductive, and, carcinogenic, hazard, potential, additionally, they, should, be, informed, and, trained, on, the, measures, they, should, take, to, avoid, and, protect, themselves, from, these, hazards, this, information, ought, to, be, provided, when, health, care, workers, come, into, contact, with, the, drugs, that, is, perform, the, initial, assignment, in, a, work, area, with, hazardous, drugs, moreover, training, should, also, be, provided, when, new, hazards, emerge, as, well, as, when, new, drugs, procedures, or, equipment, are, introduced, when, performing, cleaning, and, decontaminating, the, work, area, where, antineoplastic, drugs, are, used, one, should, make, sure, that, there, is, sufficient, ventilation, to, prevent, the, buildup, of, airborne, drug, concentrations, when, cleaning, the, work, surface, hospital, workers, should, use, deactivation, and, cleaning, agents, before, and, after, each, activity, as, well, as, at, the, end, of, their, shifts, cleaning, should, always, be, done, using, double, protective, gloves, and, disposable, gowns, after, employees, finish, up, cleaning, they, should, dispose, of, the, items, used, in, the, activity, in, a, yellow, chemotherapy, waste, container, while, still, wearing, protective, gloves, after, removing, the, gloves, they, should, thoroughly, wash, their, hands, with, soap, and, water, anything, that, comes, into, contact, or, has, a, trace, of, the, antineoplastic, drugs, such, as, needles, empty, vials, syringes, gowns, and, gloves, should, be, put, in, the, chemotherapy, waste, container, a, written, policy, needs, to, be, in, place, in, case, of, a, spill, of, antineoplastic, products, the, policy, should, address, the, possibility, of, various, sizes, of, spills, as, well, as, the, procedure, and, personal, protective, equipment, required, for, each, size, a, trained, worker, should, handle, a, large, spill, and, always, dispose, of, all, cleanup, materials, in, the, chemical, waste, container, according, to, epa, regulations, not, in, a, yellow, chemotherapy, waste, container, a, medical, surveillance, program, must, be, established, in, case, of, exposure, occupational, health, professionals, need, to, ask, for, a, detailed, history, and, do, a, thorough, physical, exam, they, should, test, the, urine, of, the, potentially, exposed, worker, by, doing, a, urine, dipstick, or, microscopic, examination, mainly, looking, for, blood, as, several, antineoplastic, drugs, are, known, to, cause, bladder, damage, urinary, mutagenicity, is, a, marker, of, exposure, to, antineoplastic, drugs, that, was, first, used, by, falck, and, colleagues, in, 1979, and, uses, bacterial, mutagenicity, assays, apart, from, being, nonspecific, the, test, can, be, influenced, by, extraneous, factors, such, as, dietary, intake, and, smoking, and, is, therefore, used, sparingly, however, the, test, played, a, significant, role, in, changing, the, use, of, horizontal, flow, cabinets, to, vertical, flow, biological, safety, cabinets, during, the, preparation, of, antineoplastic, drugs, because, the, former, exposed, health, care, workers, to, high, levels, of, drugs, this, changed, the, handling, of, drugs, and, effectively, reduced, workers, exposure, to, antineoplastic, drugs, biomarkers, of, exposure, to, antineoplastic, drugs, commonly, include, urinary, platinum, methotrexate, urinary, cyclophosphamide, and, ifosfamide, and, urinary, metabolite, of, 5, fluorouracil, in, addition, to, this, there, are, other, drugs, used, to, measure, the, drugs, directly, in, the, urine, although, they, are, rarely, used, a, measurement, of, these, drugs, directly, in, one, s, urine, is, a, sign, of, high, exposure, levels, and, that, an, uptake, of, the, drugs, is, happening, either, through, inhalation, or, dermally, there, is, an, extensive, list, of, antineoplastic, agents, several, classification, schemes, have, been, used, to, subdivide, the, medicines, used, for, cancer, into, several, different, types, the, first, use, of, small, molecule, drugs, to, treat, cancer, was, in, the, early, 20th, century, although, the, specific, chemicals, first, used, were, not, originally, intended, for, that, purpose, mustard, gas, was, used, as, a, chemical, warfare, agent, during, world, war, i, and, was, discovered, to, be, a, potent, suppressor, of, hematopoiesis, blood, production, a, similar, family, of, compounds, known, as, nitrogen, mustards, were, studied, further, during, world, war, ii, at, the, yale, school, of, medicine, it, was, reasoned, that, an, agent, that, damaged, the, rapidly, growing, white, blood, cells, might, have, a, similar, effect, on, cancer, therefore, in, december, 1942, several, people, with, advanced, lymphomas, cancers, of, the, lymphatic, system, and, lymph, nodes, were, given, the, drug, by, vein, rather, than, by, breathing, the, irritating, gas, their, improvement, although, temporary, was, remarkable, concurrently, during, a, military, operation, in, world, war, ii, following, a, german, air, raid, on, the, italian, harbour, of, bari, several, hundred, people, were, accidentally, exposed, to, mustard, gas, which, had, been, transported, there, by, the, allied, forces, to, prepare, for, possible, retaliation, in, the, event, of, german, use, of, chemical, warfare, the, survivors, were, later, found, to, have, very, low, white, blood, cell, counts, after, wwii, was, over, and, the, reports, declassified, the, experiences, converged, and, led, researchers, to, look, for, other, substances, that, might, have, similar, effects, against, cancer, the, first, chemotherapy, drug, to, be, developed, from, this, line, of, research, was, mustine, since, then, many, other, drugs, have, been, developed, to, treat, cancer, and, drug, development, has, exploded, into, a, multibillion, dollar, industry, although, the, principles, and, limitations, of, chemotherapy, discovered, by, the, early, researchers, still, apply, the, word, chemotherapy, without, a, modifier, usually, refers, to, cancer, treatment, but, its, historical, meaning, was, broader, the, term, was, coined, in, the, early, 1900s, by, paul, ehrlich, as, meaning, any, use, of, chemicals, to, treat, any, disease, chemo, therapy, such, as, the, use, of, antibiotics, antibacterial, chemotherapy, ehrlich, was, not, optimistic, that, effective, chemotherapy, drugs, would, be, found, for, the, treatment, of, cancer, the, first, modern, chemotherapeutic, agent, was, arsphenamine, an, arsenic, compound, discovered, in, 1907, and, used, to, treat, syphilis, this, was, later, followed, by, sulfonamides, sulfa, drugs, and, penicillin, in, today, s, usage, the, sense, any, treatment, of, disease, with, drugs, is, often, expressed, with, the, word, pharmacotherapy, in, terms, of, metaphorical, language, chemotherapy, can, be, paralleled, with, the, idea, of, a, storm, as, both, can, cause, distress, but, afterwards, may, have, a, healing, cleaning, effect, specially, targeted, delivery, vehicles, aim, to, increase, effective, levels, of, chemotherapy, for, tumor, cells, while, reducing, effective, levels, for, other, cells, this, should, result, in, an, increased, tumor, kill, or, reduced, toxicity, or, both, antibody, drug, conjugates, adcs, comprise, an, antibody, drug, and, a, linker, between, them, the, antibody, will, be, targeted, at, a, preferentially, expressed, protein, in, the, tumour, cells, known, as, a, tumor, antigen, or, on, cells, that, the, tumor, can, utilise, such, as, blood, vessel, endothelial, cells, they, bind, to, the, tumor, antigen, and, are, internalised, where, the, linker, releases, the, drug, into, the, cell, these, specially, targeted, delivery, vehicles, vary, in, their, stability, selectivity, and, choice, of, target, but, in, essence, they, all, aim, to, increase, the, maximum, effective, dose, that, can, be, delivered, to, the, tumor, cells, reduced, systemic, toxicity, means, that, they, can, also, be, used, in, people, who, are, sicker, and, that, they, can, carry, new, chemotherapeutic, agents, that, would, have, been, far, too, toxic, to, deliver, via, traditional, systemic, approaches, the, first, approved, drug, of, this, type, was, gemtuzumab, ozogamicin, mylotarg, released, by, wyeth, now, pfizer, the, drug, was, approved, to, treat, acute, myeloid, leukemia, two, other, drugs, trastuzumab, emtansine, and, brentuximab, vedotin, are, both, in, late, clinical, trials, and, the, latter, has, been, granted, accelerated, approval, for, the, treatment, of, refractory, hodgkin, s, lymphoma, and, systemic, anaplastic, large, cell, lymphoma, nanoparticles, are, 1, 1000, nanometer, nm, sized, particles, that, can, promote, tumor, selectivity, and, aid, in, delivering, low, solubility, drugs, nanoparticles, can, be, targeted, passively, or, actively, passive, targeting, exploits, the, difference, between, tumor, blood, vessels, and, normal, blood, vessels, blood, vessels, in, tumors, are, leaky, because, they, have, gaps, from, 200, to, 2000, nm, which, allow, nanoparticles, to, escape, into, the, tumor, active, targeting, uses, biological, molecules, antibodies, proteins, dna, and, receptor, ligands, to, preferentially, target, the, nanoparticles, to, the, tumor, cells, there, are, many, types, of, nanoparticle, delivery, systems, such, as, silica, polymers, liposomes, and, magnetic, particles, nanoparticles, made, of, magnetic, material, can, also, be, used, to, concentrate, agents, at, tumor, sites, using, an, externally, applied, magnetic, field, they, have, emerged, as, a, useful, vehicle, in, magnetic, drug, delivery, for, poorly, soluble, agents, such, as, paclitaxel, electrochemotherapy, is, the, combined, treatment, in, which, injection, of, a, chemotherapeutic, drug, is, followed, by, application, of, high, voltage, electric, pulses, locally, to, the, tumor, the, treatment, enables, the, chemotherapeutic, drugs, which, otherwise, cannot, or, hardly, go, through, the, membrane, of, cells, such, as, bleomycin, and, cisplatin, to, enter, the, cancer, cells, hence, greater, effectiveness, of, antitumor, treatment, is, achieved, clinical, electrochemotherapy, has, been, successfully, used, for, treatment, of, cutaneous, and, subcutaneous, tumors, irrespective, of, their, histological, origin, the, method, has, been, reported, as, safe, simple, and, highly, effective, in, all, reports, on, clinical, use, of, electrochemotherapy, according, to, the, esope, project, european, standard, operating, procedures, of, electrochemotherapy, the, standard, operating, procedures, sop, for, electrochemotherapy, were, prepared, based, on, the, experience, of, the, leading, european, cancer, centres, on, electrochemotherapy, recently, new, electrochemotherapy, modalities, have, been, developed, for, treatment, of, internal, tumors, using, surgical, procedures, endoscopic, routes, or, percutaneous, approaches, to, gain, access, to, the, treatment, area, hyperthermia, therapy, is, heat, treatment, for, cancer, that, can, be, a, powerful, tool, when, used, in, combination, with, chemotherapy, thermochemotherapy, or, radiation, for, the, control, of, a, variety, of, cancers, the, heat, can, be, applied, locally, to, the, tumor, site, which, will, dilate, blood, vessels, to, the, tumor, allowing, more, chemotherapeutic, medication, to, enter, the, tumor, additionally, the, tumor, cell, membrane, will, become, more, porous, further, allowing, more, of, the, chemotherapeutic, medicine, to, enter, the, tumor, cell, hyperthermia, has, also, been, shown, to, help, prevent, or, reverse, chemo, resistance, chemotherapy, resistance, sometimes, develops, over, time, as, the, tumors, adapt, and, can, overcome, the, toxicity, of, the, chemo, medication, overcoming, chemoresistance, has, been, extensively, studied, within, the, past, especially, using, cddp, resistant, cells, in, regard, to, the, potential, benefit, that, drug, resistant, cells, can, be, recruited, for, effective, therapy, by, combining, chemotherapy, with, hyperthermia, it, was, important, to, show, that, chemoresistance, against, several, anticancer, drugs, e, g, mitomycin, c, anthracyclines, bcnu, melphalan, including, cddp, could, be, reversed, at, least, partially, by, the, addition, of, heat, chemotherapy, is, used, in, veterinary, medicine, similar, to, how, it, is, used, in, human, medicine
