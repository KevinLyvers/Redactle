a, mouse, pl, mice, is, a, small, rodent, characteristically, mice, are, known, to, have, a, pointed, snout, small, rounded, ears, a, body, length, scaly, tail, and, a, high, breeding, rate, the, best, known, mouse, species, is, the, common, house, mouse, mus, musculus, mice, are, also, popular, as, pets, in, some, places, certain, kinds, of, field, mice, are, locally, common, they, are, known, to, invade, homes, for, food, and, shelter, mice, are, typically, distinguished, from, rats, by, their, size, generally, when, a, muroid, rodent, is, discovered, its, common, name, includes, the, term, mouse, if, it, is, smaller, or, rat, if, it, is, larger, the, common, terms, rat, and, mouse, are, not, taxonomically, specific, typical, mice, are, classified, in, the, genus, mus, but, the, term, mouse, is, not, confined, to, members, of, mus, and, can, also, apply, to, species, from, other, genera, such, as, the, deer, mouse, peromyscus, domestic, mice, sold, as, pets, often, differ, substantially, in, size, from, the, common, house, mouse, this, is, attributable, to, breeding, and, different, conditions, in, the, wild, the, best, known, strain, of, mouse, is, the, white, lab, mouse, it, has, more, uniform, traits, that, are, appropriate, to, its, use, in, research, cats, wild, dogs, foxes, birds, of, prey, snakes, and, certain, kinds, of, arthropods, have, been, known, to, prey, upon, mice, despite, this, mice, populations, remain, plentiful, due, to, its, remarkable, adaptability, to, almost, any, environment, the, mouse, is, one, of, the, most, successful, mammalian, genera, living, on, earth, today, in, certain, contexts, mice, can, be, considered, vermin, vermin, are, a, major, source, of, crop, damage, as, they, are, known, to, cause, structural, damage, and, spread, disease, mice, spread, disease, through, their, feces, and, are, often, carriers, of, parasites, in, north, america, breathing, dust, that, has, come, in, contact, with, mouse, excrement, has, been, linked, to, hantavirus, which, may, lead, to, hantavirus, pulmonary, syndrome, hps, primarily, nocturnal, animals, mice, compensate, for, their, poor, eyesight, with, a, keen, sense, of, hearing, they, depend, on, their, sense, of, smell, to, locate, food, and, avoid, predators, in, the, wild, mice, are, known, to, build, intricate, burrows, these, burrows, have, long, entrances, and, are, equipped, with, escape, tunnels, in, at, least, one, species, the, architectural, design, of, a, burrow, is, a, genetic, trait, the, most, common, mice, are, murines, in, the, same, clade, as, common, rats, they, are, murids, along, with, gerbils, and, other, close, relatives, researchers, at, the, max, planck, institute, of, neurobiology, have, confirmed, that, mice, have, a, range, of, facial, expressions, they, used, machine, vision, to, spot, familiar, human, emotions, like, pleasure, disgust, nausea, pain, and, fear, in, nature, mice, are, largely, herbivores, consuming, any, kind, of, fruit, or, grain, from, plants, however, mice, adapt, well, to, urban, areas, and, are, known, for, eating, almost, all, types, of, food, scraps, in, captivity, mice, are, commonly, fed, commercial, pelleted, mouse, diet, these, diets, are, nutritionally, complete, but, they, still, need, a, large, variety, of, vegetables, despite, popular, belief, most, mice, do, not, have, a, special, appetite, for, cheese, they, will, only, eat, cheese, for, lack, of, better, options, mice, are, common, experimental, animals, in, laboratory, research, of, biology, and, psychology, fields, primarily, because, they, are, mammals, and, also, because, they, share, a, high, degree, of, homology, with, humans, they, are, the, most, commonly, used, mammalian, model, organism, more, common, than, rats, the, mouse, genome, has, been, sequenced, and, virtually, all, mouse, genes, have, human, homologs, the, mouse, has, approximately, 2, 7, billion, base, pairs, and, 20, pairs, of, chromosomes, they, can, also, be, manipulated, in, ways, that, are, illegal, with, humans, although, animal, rights, activists, often, object, a, knockout, mouse, is, a, genetically, modified, mouse, that, has, had, one, or, more, of, its, genes, made, inoperable, through, a, gene, knockout, experimental, mouse, model, systems, include, mouse, models, of, colorectal, and, intestinal, cancer, mouse, models, of, down, syndrome, and, mouse, models, of, breast, cancer, metastasis, reasons, for, common, selection, of, mice, are, that, they, are, small, and, inexpensive, have, a, widely, varied, diet, are, easily, maintained, and, can, reproduce, quickly, several, generations, of, mice, can, be, observed, in, a, relatively, short, time, mice, are, generally, very, docile, if, raised, from, birth, and, given, sufficient, human, contact, however, certain, strains, have, been, known, to, be, quite, temperamental, many, people, buy, mice, as, companion, pets, they, can, be, playful, loving, and, can, grow, used, to, being, handled, like, pet, rats, pet, mice, should, not, be, left, unsupervised, outside, as, they, have, many, natural, predators, including, but, not, limited, to, birds, snakes, lizards, cats, and, dogs, male, mice, tend, to, have, a, stronger, odor, than, the, females, however, mice, are, careful, groomers, and, as, pets, they, never, need, bathing, well, looked, after, mice, can, make, ideal, pets, some, common, mouse, care, products, are, mice, are, a, staple, in, the, diet, of, many, small, carnivores, in, various, countries, mice, are, used, as, feed, for, pets, such, as, snakes, lizards, frogs, tarantulas, and, birds, of, prey, and, many, pet, stores, carry, mice, for, this, purpose, such, mice, are, sold, in, various, sizes, and, with, various, amounts, of, fur, mice, without, fur, are, easier, for, the, animal, to, consume, however, mice, with, fur, may, be, more, convincing, as, animal, feed, humans, have, eaten, mice, since, prehistoric, times, in, victorian, britain, fried, mice, were, still, given, to, children, as, a, folk, remedy, for, bed, wetting, while, jared, diamond, reports, creamed, mice, being, used, in, england, as, a, dietary, supplement, during, second, world, war, rationing, mice, are, a, delicacy, throughout, eastern, zambia, and, northern, malawi, where, they, are, a, seasonal, source, of, protein, field, rat, is, a, popular, food, in, vietnam, and, neighboring, countries, in, many, countries, however, mouse, is, no, longer, a, food, item, prescribed, cures, in, ancient, egypt, included, mice, as, medicine, in, ancient, egypt, when, infants, were, ill, mice, were, eaten, as, treatment, by, their, mothers, it, was, believed, that, mouse, eating, by, the, mother, would, help,
