a, skeleton, is, the, structural, frame, that, supports, the, body, of, most, animals, there, are, several, types, of, skeletons, including, the, exoskeleton, which, is, a, rigid, outer, shell, that, holds, up, an, organism, s, shape, the, endoskeleton, a, rigid, internal, frame, to, which, the, organs, and, soft, tissues, attach, and, the, hydroskeleton, a, flexible, internal, structure, supported, by, the, hydrostatic, pressure, of, body, fluids, vertebrates, are, animals, with, an, endoskeleton, centered, around, an, axial, vertebral, column, and, their, skeletons, are, typically, composed, of, bones, and, cartilages, invertebrates, are, other, animals, that, lack, a, vertebral, column, and, their, skeletons, vary, including, hard, shelled, exoskeleton, arthropods, and, most, molluscs, plated, internal, shells, e, g, cuttlebones, in, some, cephalopods, or, rods, e, g, ossicles, in, echinoderms, hydrostatically, supported, body, cavities, most, and, spicules, sponges, cartilage, is, a, rigid, connective, tissue, that, is, found, in, the, skeletal, systems, of, vertebrates, and, invertebrates, the, term, skeleton, comes, from, ancient, greek, skelet, s, dried, up, sceleton, is, an, archaic, form, of, the, word, skeletons, can, be, defined, by, several, attributes, solid, skeletons, consist, of, hard, substances, such, as, bone, cartilage, or, cuticle, these, can, be, further, divided, by, location, internal, skeletons, are, endoskeletons, and, external, skeletons, are, exoskeletons, skeletons, may, also, be, defined, by, rigidity, where, pliant, skeletons, are, more, elastic, than, rigid, skeletons, fluid, or, hydrostatic, skeletons, do, not, have, hard, structures, like, solid, skeletons, instead, functioning, via, pressurized, fluids, hydrostatic, skeletons, are, always, internal, an, exoskeleton, is, an, external, skeleton, that, covers, the, body, of, an, animal, serving, as, armor, to, protect, an, animal, from, predators, arthropods, have, exoskeletons, that, encase, their, bodies, and, have, to, undergo, periodic, moulting, or, ecdysis, as, the, animals, grow, the, shells, of, molluscs, are, another, form, of, exoskeleton, exoskeletons, provide, surfaces, for, the, attachment, of, muscles, and, specialized, appendanges, of, the, exoskeleton, can, assist, with, movement, and, defense, in, arthropods, the, exoskeleton, also, assists, with, sensory, perception, an, external, skeleton, can, be, quite, heavy, in, relation, to, the, overall, mass, of, an, animal, so, on, land, organisms, that, have, an, exoskeleton, are, mostly, relatively, small, somewhat, larger, aquatic, animals, can, support, an, exoskeleton, because, weight, is, less, of, a, consideration, underwater, the, southern, giant, clam, a, species, of, extremely, large, saltwater, clam, in, the, pacific, ocean, has, a, shell, that, is, massive, in, both, size, and, weight, syrinx, aruanus, is, a, species, of, sea, snail, with, a, very, large, shell, endoskeletons, are, the, internal, support, structure, of, an, animal, composed, of, mineralized, tissues, such, as, the, bone, skeletons, found, in, most, vertebrates, endoskeletons, are, highly, specialized, and, vary, significantly, between, animals, they, vary, in, complexity, from, functioning, purely, for, support, as, in, the, case, of, sponges, to, serving, as, an, attachment, site, for, muscles, and, a, mechanism, for, transmitting, muscular, forces, a, true, endoskeleton, is, derived, from, mesodermal, tissue, endoskeletons, occur, in, chordates, echinoderms, all, great, apes, including, humans, and, sponges, pliant, skeletons, are, capable, of, movement, thus, when, stress, is, applied, to, the, skeletal, structure, it, deforms, and, then, regains, its, original, shape, this, skeletal, structure, is, used, in, some, invertebrates, for, instance, in, the, hinge, of, bivalve, shells, or, the, mesoglea, of, cnidarians, such, as, jellyfish, pliant, skeletons, are, beneficial, because, only, muscle, contractions, are, needed, to, bend, the, skeleton, upon, muscle, relaxation, the, skeleton, will, return, to, its, original, shape, cartilage, is, one, material, that, a, pliant, skeleton, may, be, composed, of, but, most, pliant, skeletons, are, formed, from, a, mixture, of, proteins, polysaccharides, and, water, for, additional, structure, or, protection, pliant, skeletons, may, be, supported, by, rigid, skeletons, organisms, that, have, pliant, skeletons, typically, live, in, water, which, supports, body, structure, in, the, absence, of, a, rigid, skeleton, rigid, skeletons, are, not, capable, of, movement, when, stressed, creating, a, strong, support, system, most, common, in, terrestrial, animals, such, a, skeleton, type, used, by, animals, that, live, in, water, are, more, for, protection, such, as, barnacle, and, snail, shells, or, for, fast, moving, animals, that, require, additional, support, of, musculature, needed, for, swimming, through, water, rigid, skeletons, are, formed, from, materials, including, chitin, in, arthropods, calcium, compounds, such, as, calcium, carbonate, in, stony, corals, and, mollusks, and, silicate, for, diatoms, and, radiolarians, hydrostatic, skeletons, are, flexible, cavities, within, an, animal, that, provide, structure, through, fluid, pressure, occurring, in, some, types, of, soft, bodied, organisms, including, jellyfish, flatworms, nematodes, and, earthworms, the, walls, of, these, cavities, are, made, of, muscle, and, connective, tissue, in, addition, to, providing, structure, for, an, animal, s, body, hydrostatic, skeletons, transmit, the, forces, of, muscle, contraction, allowing, an, animal, to, move, by, alternating, contractions, and, expansions, of, muscles, along, the, animal, s, length, the, cytoskeleton, cyto, meaning, cell, is, used, to, stabilize, and, preserve, the, form, of, the, cells, it, is, a, dynamic, structure, that, maintains, cell, shape, protects, the, cell, enables, cellular, motion, using, structures, such, as, flagella, cilia, and, lamellipodia, and, transport, within, cells, such, as, the, movement, of, vesicles, and, organelles, and, plays, a, role, in, cellular, division, the, cytoskeleton, is, not, a, skeleton, in, the, sense, that, it, provides, the, structural, system, for, the, body, of, an, animal, rather, it, serves, a, similar, function, at, the, cellular, level, in, most, vertebrates, the, main, skeletal, component, is, bone, bones, compose, a, unique, skeletal, system, for, each, type, of, animal, another, important, component, is, cartilage, which, in, mammals, is, found, mainly, in, the, joint, areas, in, other, animals, such, as, the, cartilaginous, fishes, which, include, the, sharks, the, skeleton, is, composed, entirely, of, cartilage, the, segmental, pattern, of, the, skeleton, is, present, in, all, vertebrates, with, basic, units, being, repeated, such, as, in, the, vertebral, column, and, the, ribcage, bones, are, rigid, organs, that, form, part, of, the, endoskeleton, of, vertebrates, they, provide, structural, support, for, the, body, assist, in, movement, by, opposing, muscular, contraction, and, create, a, protective, wall, around, internal, organs, bones, are, primarily, made, of, inorganic, minerals, such, as, hydroxyapatite, while, the, remainder, is, made, of, an, organic, matrix, and, water, the, hollow, tubular, structure, of, bones, provide, considerable, resistance, against, compression, while, staying, lightweight, most, cells, in, bones, are, either, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, or, osteocytes, bone, tissue, is, a, type, of, dense, connective, tissue, one, of, the, types, of, tissue, that, makes, up, bone, tissue, is, mineralized, tissue, and, this, gives, it, rigidity, and, a, honeycomb, like, three, dimensional, internal, structure, bones, also, produce, red, and, white, blood, cells, and, serve, as, calcium, and, phosphate, storage, at, the, cellular, level, other, types, of, tissue, found, in, bones, include, marrow, endosteum, and, periosteum, nerves, blood, vessels, and, cartilage, during, embryonic, development, bones, are, developed, individually, from, skeletogenic, cells, in, the, ectoderm, and, mesoderm, most, of, these, cells, develop, into, separate, bone, cartilage, and, joint, cells, and, they, are, then, articulated, with, one, another, specialized, skeletal, tissues, are, unique, to, vertebrates, cartilage, grows, more, quickly, than, bone, causing, it, to, be, more, prominent, earlier, in, an, animal, s, life, before, it, is, overtaken, by, bone, cartilage, is, also, used, in, vertebrates, to, resist, stress, at, points, of, articulation, in, the, skeleton, cartilage, in, vertebrates, is, usually, encased, in, perichondrium, tissue, ligaments, are, elastic, tissues, that, connect, bones, to, other, bones, and, tendons, are, elastic, tissues, that, connect, muscles, to, bones, the, skeletons, of, turtles, have, evolved, to, develop, a, shell, from, the, ribcage, forming, an, exoskeleton, the, skeletons, of, snakes, and, caecilians, have, significantly, more, vertebrae, than, other, animals, snakes, often, have, over, 300, compared, to, the, 65, that, is, typical, in, lizards, the, skeletons, of, birds, are, adapted, for, flight, the, bones, in, bird, skeletons, are, hollow, and, lightweight, to, reduce, the, metabolic, cost, of, flight, several, attributes, of, the, shape, and, structure, of, the, bones, are, optimized, to, endure, the, physical, stress, associated, with, flight, including, a, round, and, thin, humeral, shaft, and, the, fusion, of, skeletal, elements, into, single, ossifications, because, of, this, birds, usually, have, a, smaller, number, of, bones, than, other, terrestrial, vertebrates, birds, also, lack, teeth, or, even, a, true, jaw, instead, having, evolved, a, beak, which, is, far, more, lightweight, the, beaks, of, many, baby, birds, have, a, projection, called, an, egg, tooth, which, facilitates, their, exit, from, the, amniotic, egg, the, skeleton, which, forms, the, support, structure, inside, the, fish, is, either, made, of, cartilage, as, in, the, chondrichthyes, or, bones, as, in, the, osteichthyes, the, main, skeletal, element, is, the, vertebral, column, composed, of, articulating, vertebrae, which, are, lightweight, yet, strong, the, ribs, attach, to, the, spine, and, there, are, no, limbs, or, limb, girdles, they, are, supported, only, by, the, muscles, the, main, external, features, of, the, fish, the, fins, are, composed, of, either, bony, or, soft, spines, called, rays, which, with, the, exception, of, the, caudal, fin, tail, fin, have, no, direct, connection, with, the, spine, they, are, supported, by, the, muscles, which, compose, the, main, part, of, the, trunk, cartilaginous, fish, such, as, sharks, rays, skates, and, chimeras, have, skeletons, made, entirely, of, cartilage, the, lighter, weight, of, cartilage, allows, these, fish, to, expend, less, energy, when, swimming, to, facilitate, the, movement, of, marine, mammals, in, water, the, hind, legs, were, either, lost, altogether, as, in, the, whales, and, manatees, or, united, in, a, single, tail, fin, as, in, the, pinnipeds, seals, in, the, whale, the, cervical, vertebrae, are, typically, fused, an, adaptation, trading, flexibility, for, stability, during, swimming, the, skeleton, consists, of, both, fused, and, individual, bones, supported, and, supplemented, by, ligaments, tendons, muscles, and, cartilage, it, serves, as, a, scaffold, which, supports, organs, anchors, muscles, and, protects, organs, such, as, the, brain, lungs, heart, and, spinal, cord, the, biggest, bone, in, the, body, is, the, femur, in, the, upper, leg, and, the, smallest, is, the, stapes, bone, in, the, middle, ear, in, an, adult, the, skeleton, comprises, around, 13, 1, of, the, total, body, weight, and, half, of, this, weight, is, water, fused, bones, include, those, of, the, pelvis, and, the, cranium, not, all, bones, are, interconnected, directly, there, are, three, bones, in, each, middle, ear, called, the, ossicles, that, articulate, only, with, each, other, the, hyoid, bone, which, is, located, in, the, neck, and, serves, as, the, point, of, attachment, for, the, tongue, does, not, articulate, with, any, other, bones, in, the, body, being, supported, by, muscles, and, ligaments, there, are, 206, bones, in, the, adult, human, skeleton, although, this, number, depends, on, whether, the, pelvic, bones, the, hip, bones, on, each, side, are, counted, as, one, or, three, bones, on, each, side, ilium, ischium, and, pubis, whether, the, coccyx, or, tail, bone, is, counted, as, one, or, four, separate, bones, and, does, not, count, the, variable, wormian, bones, between, skull, sutures, similarly, the, sacrum, is, usually, counted, as, a, single, bone, rather, than, five, fused, vertebrae, there, is, also, a, variable, number, of, small, sesamoid, bones, commonly, found, in, tendons, the, patella, or, kneecap, on, each, side, is, an, example, of, a, larger, sesamoid, bone, the, patellae, are, counted, in, the, total, as, they, are, constant, the, number, of, bones, varies, between, individuals, and, with, age, newborn, babies, have, over, 270, bones, some, of, which, fuse, together, these, bones, are, organized, into, a, longitudinal, axis, the, axial, skeleton, to, which, the, appendicular, skeleton, is, attached, the, human, skeleton, takes, 20, years, before, it, is, fully, developed, and, the, bones, contain, marrow, which, produces, blood, cells, there, exist, several, general, differences, between, the, male, and, female, skeletons, the, male, skeleton, for, example, is, generally, larger, and, heavier, than, the, female, skeleton, in, the, female, skeleton, the, bones, of, the, skull, are, generally, less, angular, the, female, skeleton, also, has, wider, and, shorter, breastbone, and, slimmer, wrists, there, exist, significant, differences, between, the, male, and, female, pelvis, which, are, related, to, the, female, s, pregnancy, and, childbirth, capabilities, the, female, pelvis, is, wider, and, shallower, than, the, male, pelvis, female, pelvises, also, have, an, enlarged, pelvic, outlet, and, a, wider, and, more, circular, pelvic, inlet, the, angle, between, the, pubic, bones, is, known, to, be, sharper, in, males, which, results, in, a, more, circular, narrower, and, near, heart, shaped, pelvis, invertebrates, are, defined, by, a, lack, of, vertebral, column, and, they, do, not, have, bone, skeletons, arthropods, have, exoskeletons, and, echinoderms, have, endoskeletons, some, soft, bodied, organisms, such, as, jellyfish, and, earthworms, have, hydrostatic, skeletons, the, skeletons, of, arthropods, including, insects, crustaceans, and, arachnids, are, cuticle, exoskeletons, they, are, composed, of, chitin, secreted, by, the, epidermis, the, cuticle, covers, the, animal, s, body, and, lines, several, internal, organs, including, parts, of, the, digestive, system, arthropods, molt, as, they, grow, through, a, process, of, ecdysis, developing, a, new, exoskeleton, digesting, part, of, the, previous, skeleton, and, leaving, the, remainder, behind, an, arthropod, s, skeleton, serves, many, functions, working, as, an, integument, to, provide, a, barrier, and, support, the, body, providing, appendages, for, movement, and, defense, and, assisting, in, sensory, perception, some, arthropods, such, as, crustaceans, absorb, biominerals, like, calcium, carbonate, from, the, environment, to, strengthen, the, cuticle, the, skeletons, of, echinoderms, such, as, starfish, and, sea, urchins, are, endoskeletons, that, consist, of, large, well, developed, sclerite, plates, that, adjoin, or, overlap, to, cover, the, animal, s, body, the, skeletons, of, sea, cucumbers, are, an, exception, having, a, reduced, size, to, assist, in, feeding, and, movement, echinoderm, skeletons, are, composed, of, stereom, made, up, of, calcite, with, a, monocrystal, structure, they, also, have, a, significant, magnesium, content, forming, up, to, 15, of, the, skeleton, s, composition, the, stereome, structure, is, porous, and, the, pores, fill, with, connective, stromal, tissue, as, the, animal, ages, sea, urchins, have, as, many, as, ten, variants, of, stereome, structure, among, extant, animals, such, skeletons, are, unique, to, echinoderms, though, similar, skeletons, were, used, by, some, paleozoic, animals, the, skeletons, of, echinoderms, are, mesodermal, as, they, are, mostly, encased, by, soft, tissue, plates, of, the, skeleton, may, be, interlocked, or, connected, through, muscles, and, ligaments, skeletal, elements, in, echinoderms, are, highly, specialized, and, take, many, forms, though, they, usually, retain, some, form, of, symmetry, the, spines, of, sea, urchins, are, the, largest, type, of, echinoderm, skeletal, structure, some, molluscs, such, as, conchs, scallops, and, snails, have, shells, that, serve, as, exoskeletons, they, are, produced, by, proteins, and, minerals, secreted, from, the, animal, s, mantle, the, skeleton, of, sponges, consists, of, microscopic, calcareous, or, silicious, spicules, the, demosponges, include, 90, of, all, species, of, sponges, their, skeletons, are, made, of, spicules, consisting, of, fibers, of, the, protein, spongin, the, mineral, silica, or, both, where, spicules, of, silica, are, present, they, have, a, different, shape, from, those, in, the, otherwise, similar, glass, sponges, cartilage, is, a, connective, skeletal, tissue, composed, of, specialized, cells, called, chondrocytes, that, in, an, extracellular, matrix, this, matrix, is, typically, composed, of, type, ii, collagen, fibers, proteoglycans, and, water, there, are, many, types, of, cartilage, including, elastic, cartilage, hyaline, cartilage, fibrocartilage, and, lipohyaline, cartilage, unlike, other, connective, tissues, cartilage, does, not, contain, blood, vessels, the, chondrocytes, are, supplied, by, diffusion, helped, by, the, pumping, action, generated, by, compression, of, the, articular, cartilage, or, flexion, of, the, elastic, cartilage, thus, compared, to, other, connective, tissues, cartilage, grows, and, repairs, more, slowly,
