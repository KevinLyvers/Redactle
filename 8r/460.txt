osteichthyes, s, t, i, k, i, i, z, also, known, as, osteichthyans, or, commonly, referred, to, as, the, bony, fish, is, a, diverse, superclass, of, vertebrate, animals, that, have, endoskeletons, primarily, composed, of, bone, tissue, they, can, be, contrasted, with, the, chondrichthyes, cartilaginous, fish, and, the, extinct, placoderms, and, acanthodians, which, have, endoskeletons, primarily, composed, of, cartilage, the, vast, majority, of, extant, fish, are, members, of, osteichthyes, being, an, extremely, diverse, and, abundant, group, consisting, of, 45, orders, over, 435, families, and, 28, 000, species, it, is, the, largest, class, of, vertebrates, in, existence, today, encompassing, most, aquatic, vertebrates, as, well, as, all, semi, aquatic, and, terrestrial, vertebrates, the, group, is, divided, into, two, main, clades, the, ray, finned, fish, actinopterygii, which, makes, up, the, vast, majority, of, extant, fish, and, the, lobe, finned, fish, sarcopterygii, which, gave, rise, to, all, land, vertebrates, i, e, tetrapods, the, oldest, known, fossils, of, bony, fish, are, about, 425, million, years, old, from, the, late, silurian, which, are, also, transitional, fossils, showing, a, tooth, pattern, that, is, in, between, the, tooth, rows, of, sharks, and, true, bony, fishes, despite, the, name, these, early, basal, bony, fish, had, not, yet, evolved, ossification, and, their, skeletons, were, still, mostly, cartilaginous, and, the, main, distinguishing, feature, that, set, them, apart, from, other, fish, clades, were, the, development, of, foregut, pouches, that, eventually, evolved, into, the, swim, bladders, and, lungs, respectively, osteichthyes, can, be, compared, to, euteleostomi, in, paleontology, the, terms, are, synonymous, in, ichthyology, the, difference, is, that, euteleostomi, presents, a, cladistic, view, which, includes, the, terrestrial, tetrapods, that, evolved, from, lobe, finned, fish, until, recently, the, view, of, most, ichthyologists, has, been, that, osteichthyes, were, paraphyletic, and, include, only, fishes, however, since, 2013, widely, cited, ichthyology, papers, have, been, published, with, phylogenetic, trees, that, treat, the, osteichthyes, as, a, clade, including, tetrapods, bony, fish, are, characterized, by, a, relatively, stable, pattern, of, cranial, bones, rooted, medial, insertion, of, mandibular, muscle, in, the, lower, jaw, the, head, and, pectoral, girdles, are, covered, with, large, dermal, bones, the, eyeball, is, supported, by, a, sclerotic, ring, of, four, small, bones, but, this, characteristic, has, been, lost, or, modified, in, many, modern, species, the, labyrinth, in, the, inner, ear, contains, large, otoliths, the, braincase, or, neurocranium, is, frequently, divided, into, anterior, and, posterior, sections, divided, by, a, fissure, early, bony, fish, had, simple, respiratory, diverticula, an, outpouching, on, either, side, of, the, esophagus, which, helped, them, breathe, air, in, low, oxygen, water, as, a, form, of, supplementary, enteral, respiration, in, ray, finned, fish, these, have, evolved, into, swim, bladders, the, changing, sizes, of, which, help, to, alter, the, body, s, specific, density, and, buoyancy, in, elpistostegalians, a, crown, group, of, lobe, finned, fish, that, gave, rise, to, the, land, dwelling, tetrapods, these, respiratory, diverticula, became, further, specialized, for, obligated, air, breathing, and, evolved, into, the, modern, amphibian, reptilian, avian, and, mammalian, lungs, early, bony, fish, did, not, have, fin, spines, like, most, modern, fish, but, instead, had, the, fleshy, paddle, like, fins, similar, to, other, non, bony, clades, of, fish, although, the, lobe, finned, fish, evolved, articulated, appendicular, skeletons, within, their, paired, fins, which, gave, rise, to, tetrapods, limbs, they, also, evolved, a, pair, of, opercula, gill, covers, which, can, actively, draw, water, across, the, gills, so, they, can, breathe, without, having, to, swim, bony, fish, do, not, have, placoid, scales, like, cartilaginous, fish, instead, they, consist, of, three, types, of, scales, that, do, not, penetrate, the, epidermis, in, the, process, the, three, categories, of, scales, for, osteichthyes, which, are, cosmoid, scales, ganoid, scales, teleost, scales, the, teleost, scales, are, also, then, divided, into, two, subgroups, which, are, the, cycloid, scales, and, the, ctenoid, scales, all, these, scales, have, a, base, of, bone, that, they, all, originate, from, the, only, difference, is, that, the, teleost, scales, only, have, one, layer, of, bone, ganoid, scales, have, lamellar, bone, and, vascular, bone, that, lies, on, top, of, the, lamellar, bone, then, enamel, lies, on, top, of, both, layers, of, bone, cosmoid, scales, have, the, same, two, layers, of, bone, that, ganoid, scales, have, except, they, have, dentin, in, between, the, enamel, and, vascular, bone, and, lamellar, vascular, and, lamellar, two, subcategories, for, bone, found, in, scales, all, these, scales, are, found, underneath, the, epidermis, and, do, not, break, the, epidermis, of, the, fish, unlike, the, placoid, scales, that, poke, through, the, epidermis, of, the, fish, it, is, increasingly, widely, accepted, that, tetrapods, including, ourselves, are, simply, modified, bony, fishes, and, so, we, are, comfortable, with, using, the, taxon, osteichthyes, as, a, clade, which, now, includes, all, tetrapods, fishes, of, the, world, 5th, ed, traditionally, osteichthyes, was, considered, a, class, recognised, on, the, presence, of, a, swim, bladder, only, three, pairs, of, gill, arches, hidden, behind, a, bony, operculum, and, a, predominantly, bony, skeleton, under, this, classification, system, osteichthyes, was, considered, paraphyletic, with, regard, to, land, vertebrates, as, the, common, ancestor, of, all, osteichthyans, includes, tetrapods, amongst, its, descendants, while, the, largest, subclass, actinopterygii, ray, finned, fish, is, monophyletic, with, the, inclusion, of, the, smaller, sub, class, sarcopterygii, osteichthyes, was, regarded, as, paraphyletic, this, has, led, to, the, current, cladistic, classification, which, splits, the, osteichthyes, into, two, full, classes, under, this, scheme, osteichthyes, is, monophyletic, as, it, includes, the, tetrapods, making, it, a, synonym, of, the, clade, euteleostomi, most, bony, fish, belong, to, the, ray, finned, fish, actinopterygii, a, phylogeny, of, living, osteichthyes, including, the, tetrapods, is, shown, in, the, cladogram, below, whole, genome, duplication, took, place, in, the, ancestral, osteichthyes, coelacanthiformes, ceratodontiformes, tetrapoda, polypteriformes, acipenseriformes, lepisosteiformes, amiiformes, elopiformes, albuliformes, notacanthiformes, anguilliformes, osteoglossiformes, hiodontiformes, clupeiformes,

stomiatiformes, neoteleostei, all, bony, fish, possess, gills, for, the, majority, this, is, their, sole, or, main, means, of, respiration, lungfish, and, other, osteichthyan, species, are, capable, of, respiration, through, lungs, or, vascularized, swim, bladders, other, species, can, respire, through, their, skin, intestines, and, or, stomach, osteichthyes, are, primitively, ectothermic, cold, blooded, meaning, that, their, body, temperature, is, dependent, on, that, of, the, water, but, some, of, the, larger, marine, osteichthyids, such, as, the, opah, swordfish, and, tuna, have, independently, evolved, various, levels, of, endothermy, bony, fish, can, be, any, type, of, heterotroph, numerous, species, of, omnivore, carnivore, herbivore, filter, feeder, detritivore, or, hematophage, are, documented, some, bony, fish, are, hermaphrodites, and, a, number, of, species, exhibit, parthenogenesis, fertilization, is, usually, external, but, can, be, internal, development,

brood, eggs, with, sea, horses, being, notable, in, that, the, males, undergo, a, form, of, pregnancy, brooding, eggs, deposited, in, a, ventral, pouch, by, a, female, the, giant, sunfish, is, the, heaviest, bony, fish, in, the, world, in, late, 2021, portuguese, fishermen, found, a, dead, sunfish, near, the, coast, of, faial, island, azores, with, a, weight, of, 2, 744, kilograms, 6, 049, lb,
