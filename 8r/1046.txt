kiwifruit, often, shortened, to, kiwi, outside, new, zealand, and, australia, or, chinese, gooseberry, is, the, edible, berry, of, several, species, of, woody, vines, in, the, genus, actinidia, the, most, common, cultivar, group, of, kiwifruit, actinidia, deliciosa, hayward, is, oval, about, the, size, of, a, large, hen, s, egg, 5, 8, centimetres, 2, 3, inches, in, length, and, 4, 5, 5, 5, cm, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1, 4, in, in, diameter, kiwifruit, has, a, thin, fuzzy, fibrous, tart, but, edible, light, brown, skin, and, light, green, or, golden, flesh, with, rows, of, tiny, black, edible, seeds, the, fruit, has, a, soft, texture, with, a, sweet, and, unique, flavour, kiwifruit, is, native, to, central, and, eastern, china, the, first, recorded, description, of, the, kiwifruit, dates, to, the, 12th, century, during, the, song, dynasty, in, the, early, 20th, century, cultivation, of, kiwifruit, spread, from, china, to, new, zealand, where, the, first, commercial, plantings, occurred, the, fruit, became, popular, with, british, and, american, servicemen, stationed, in, new, zealand, during, world, war, ii, and, later, became, commonly, exported, first, to, great, britain, and, then, to, california, in, the, 1960s, early, varieties, discovered, and, cultivated, in, china, were, described, in, a, 1904, nursery, catalogue, as, having, edible, fruits, the, size, of, walnuts, and, the, flavour, of, ripe, gooseberries, leading, to, the, name, chinese, gooseberry, in, the, late, 1950s, a, major, new, zealand, exporter, began, calling, it, kiwifruit, m, ori, huakiwi, after, being, advised, by, a, united, states, client, that, border, officials, might, associate, gooseberries, with, the, risk, of, anthrax, the, name, was, first, registered, by, turners, growers, on, 15, june, 1959, and, commercially, adopted, in, 1974, in, new, zealand, and, australia, the, word, kiwi, alone, either, refers, to, the, bird, or, is, used, as, a, nickname, for, new, zealanders, it, is, almost, never, used, to, refer, to, the, fruit, kiwifruit, has, since, become, a, common, name, for, all, commercially, grown, green, kiwifruit, from, the, genus, actinidia, in, the, united, states, and, canada, the, shortened, name, kiwi, is, commonly, used, when, referring, to, the, fruit, kiwifruit, is, native, to, central, and, eastern, china, the, first, recorded, description, of, the, kiwifruit, dates, to, 12th, century, china, during, the, song, dynasty, as, it, was, usually, collected, from, the, wild, and, consumed, for, medicinal, purposes, the, plant, was, rarely, cultivated, or, bred, cultivation, of, kiwifruit, spread, from, china, in, the, early, 20th, century, to, new, zealand, where, the, first, commercial, plantings, occurred, after, the, hayward, variety, was, developed, the, fruit, became, popular, with, british, and, american, servicemen, stationed, in, new, zealand, during, world, war, ii, kiwifruit, were, later, exported, first, to, great, britain, and, then, to, california, in, the, 1960s, in, new, zealand, during, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, the, fruit, became, an, agricultural, commodity, through, the, development, of, commercially, viable, cultivars, agricultural, practices, shipping, storage, and, marketing, the, genus, actinidia, comprises, around, 60, species, their, fruits, are, quite, variable, although, most, are, easily, recognised, as, kiwifruit, because, of, their, appearance, and, shape, the, skin, of, the, fruit, varies, in, size, hairiness, and, colour, the, flesh, varies, in, colour, juiciness, texture, and, taste, some, fruits, are, unpalatable, while, others, taste, considerably, better, than, the, majority, of, commercial, cultivars, the, most, commonly, sold, kiwifruit, is, derived, from, a, deliciosa, fuzzy, kiwifruit, other, species, that, are, commonly, eaten, include, a, chinensis, golden, kiwifruit, a, coriacea, chinese, egg, gooseberry, a, arguta, hardy, kiwifruit, a, kolomikta, arctic, kiwifruit, a, melanandra, purple, kiwifruit, a, polygama, silver, vine, and, a, purpurea, hearty, red, kiwifruit, most, kiwifruit, sold, belongs, to, a, few, cultivars, of, a, deliciosa, fuzzy, kiwifruit, hayward, blake, and, saanichton, 12, they, have, a, fuzzy, dull, brown, skin, and, bright, green, flesh, the, familiar, cultivar, hayward, was, developed, by, hayward, wright, in, avondale, new, zealand, around, 1924, it, was, initially, grown, in, domestic, gardens, but, commercial, planting, began, in, the, 1940s, hayward, is, the, most, commonly, available, cultivar, in, stores, it, is, a, large, egg, shaped, fruit, with, a, sweet, flavour, saanichton, 12, from, british, columbia, is, somewhat, more, rectangular, than, hayward, and, comparably, sweet, but, the, inner, core, of, the, fruit, can, be, tough, blake, can, self, pollinate, but, it, has, a, smaller, more, oval, fruit, and, the, flavour, is, considered, inferior, kiwi, berries, are, edible, fruits, the, size, of, a, large, grape, similar, to, fuzzy, kiwifruit, in, taste, and, internal, appearance, but, with, a, thin, smooth, green, skin, they, are, primarily, produced, by, three, species, actinidia, arguta, hardy, kiwi, a, kolomikta, arctic, kiwifruit, and, a, polygama, silver, vine, they, are, fast, growing, climbing, vines, durable, over, their, growing, season, they, are, referred, to, as, kiwi, berry, baby, kiwi, dessert, kiwi, grape, kiwi, or, cocktail, kiwi, the, cultivar, issai, is, a, hybrid, of, hardy, kiwifruit, and, silver, vine, which, can, self, pollinate, grown, commercially, because, of, its, relatively, large, fruit, issai, is, less, hardy, than, most, hardy, kiwifruit, actinidia, chinensis, yellow, kiwi, or, golden, kiwifruit, has, a, smooth, bronze, skin, with, a, beak, shape, at, the, stem, attachment, flesh, colour, varies, from, bright, green, to, a, clear, intense, yellow, this, species, is, sweeter, and, more, aromatic, in, flavour, compared, to, a, deliciosa, one, of, the, most, attractive, varieties, has, a, red, iris, around, the, centre, of, the, fruit, and, yellow, flesh, outside, the, yellow, fruit, obtains, a, higher, market, price, and, being, less, hairy, than, the, fuzzy, kiwifruit, tastes, better, without, peeling, a, commercially, viable, variety, of, this, red, ringed, kiwifruit, patented, as, enzared, is, a, cultivar, of, the, chinese, hong, yang, variety, hort16a, is, a, golden, kiwifruit, cultivar, marketed, worldwide, as, zespri, gold, this, cultivar, suffered, significant, losses, in, new, zealand, in, 2010, 2013, due, to, the, psa, bacterium, a, new, cultivar, of, golden, kiwifruit, gold3, was, found, to, be, more, disease, resistant, and, most, growers, have, now, changed, to, this, cultivar, gold3, marketed, by, zespri, as, sungold, is, not, quite, as, sweet, as, hort16a, and, lacks, its, usually, slightly, pointed, tip, clones, of, the, new, variety, sungold, have, been, used, to, develop, orchards, in, china, resulting, in, partially, successful, legal, efforts, in, china, by, zespri, to, protect, their, intellectual, property, in, 2021, zespri, estimated, that, around, 5, 000, hectares, of, sungold, orchards, were, being, cultivated, in, china, mainly, in, the, sichuan, province, kiwifruit, can, be, grown, in, most, temperate, climates, with, adequate, summer, heat, where, fuzzy, kiwifruit, a, deliciosa, is, not, hardy, other, species, can, be, grown, as, substitutes, often, in, commercial, farming, different, breeds, are, used, for, rootstock, fruit, bearing, plants, and, pollinators, therefore, the, seeds, produced, are, crossbreeds, of, their, parents, even, if, the, same, breeds, are, used, for, pollinators, and, fruit, bearing, plants, there, is, no, guarantee, that, the, fruit, will, have, the, same, quality, as, the, parent, additionally, seedlings, take, seven, years, before, they, flower, so, determining, whether, the, kiwi, is, fruit, bearing, or, a, pollinator, is, time, consuming, therefore, most, kiwifruits, with, the, exception, of, rootstock, and, new, cultivars, are, propagated, asexually, this, is, done, by, grafting, the, fruit, producing, plant, onto, rootstock, grown, from, seedlings, or, if, the, plant, is, desired, to, be, a, true, cultivar, rootstock, grown, from, cuttings, of, a, mature, plant, kiwifruit, plants, generally, are, dioecious, meaning, a, plant, is, either, male, or, female, the, male, plants, have, flowers, that, produce, pollen, the, females, receive, the, pollen, to, fertilise, their, ovules, and, grow, fruit, most, kiwifruit, requires, a, male, plant, to, pollinate, the, female, plant, for, a, good, yield, of, fruit, one, male, vine, for, every, three, to, eight, female, vines, is, considered, adequate, some, varieties, can, self, pollinate, but, even, they, produce, a, greater, and, more, reliable, yield, when, pollinated, by, male, kiwifruit, cross, species, pollination, is, often, but, not, always, successful, as, long, as, bloom, times, are, synchronised, in, nature, the, species, are, pollinated, by, birds, and, native, bumblebees, which, visit, the, flowers, for, pollen, not, nectar, the, female, flowers, produce, fake, anthers, with, what, appears, to, be, pollen, on, the, tips, in, order, to, attract, the, pollinators, although, these, fake, anthers, lack, the, dna, and, food, value, of, the, male, anthers, kiwifruit, growers, rely, on, honey, bees, the, principal, for, hire, pollinator, but, commercially, grown, kiwifruit, is, notoriously, difficult, to, pollinate, the, flowers, are, not, very, attractive, to, honey, bees, in, part, because, the, flowers, do, not, produce, nectar, and, bees, quickly, learn, to, prefer, flowers, with, nectar, honey, bees, are, inefficient, cross, pollinators, for, kiwifruit, because, they, practice, floral, fidelity, each, honey, bee, visits, only, a, single, type, of, flower, in, any, foray, and, maybe, only, a, few, branches, of, a, single, plant, the, pollen, needed, from, a, different, plant, such, as, a, male, for, a, female, kiwifruit, might, never, reach, it, were, it, not, for, the, cross, pollination, that, principally, occurs, in, the, crowded, colony, it, is, in, the, colonies, that, bees, laden, with, different, pollen, literally, cross, paths, to, deal, with, these, pollination, challenges, some, producers, blow, collected, pollen, over, the, female, flowers, most, common, though, is, saturation, pollination, in, which, the, honey, bee, populations, are, made, so, large, by, placing, hives, in, the, orchards, at, a, concentration, of, about, 8, hives, per, hectare, that, bees, are, forced, to, use, this, flower, because, of, intense, competition, for, all, flowers, within, flight, distance, kiwifruit, is, picked, by, hand, and, commercially, grown, on, sturdy, support, structures, as, it, can, produce, several, tonnes, per, hectare, more, than, the, rather, weak, vines, can, support, these, are, generally, equipped, with, a, watering, system, for, irrigation, and, frost, protection, in, the, spring, kiwifruit, vines, require, vigorous, pruning, similar, to, that, of, grapevines, fruit, is, borne, on, one, year, old, and, older, canes, but, production, declines, as, each, cane, ages, canes, should, be, pruned, off, and, replaced, after, their, third, year, in, the, northern, hemisphere, the, fruit, ripens, in, november, while, in, the, southern, it, ripens, in, may, four, year, old, plants, can, produce, 15, tonnes, of, fruit, per, hectare, 14, 000, lb, per, acre, while, eight, year, old, plants, can, produce, 20, tonnes, 18, 000, lb, per, acre, the, plants, produce, their, maximum, at, eight, to, ten, years, old, the, seasonal, yields, are, variable, a, heavy, crop, on, a, vine, one, season, generally, comes, with, a, light, crop, the, following, season, fruit, harvested, when, firm, will, ripen, when, stored, properly, for, long, periods, this, allows, fruit, to, be, stored, up, to, 8, weeks, after, harvest, firm, kiwifruit, ripen, after, a, few, days, to, a, week, when, stored, at, room, temperature, but, should, not, be, kept, in, direct, sunlight, faster, ripening, occurs, when, placed, in, a, paper, bag, with, an, apple, pear, or, banana, once, a, kiwifruit, is, ripe, however, it, is, preserved, optimally, when, stored, far, from, other, fruits, as, it, is, very, sensitive, to, the, ethylene, gas, they, may, emit, thereby, tending, to, over, ripen, even, in, the, refrigerator, if, stored, appropriately, ripe, kiwifruit, normally, keep, for, about, one, to, two, weeks, pseudomonas, syringae, actinidiae, psa, was, first, identified, in, japan, in, the, 1980s, this, bacterial, strain, has, been, controlled, and, managed, successfully, in, orchards, in, asia, in, 1992, it, was, found, in, northern, italy, in, 2007, 2008, economic, losses, were, observed, as, a, more, virulent, strain, became, more, dominant, psa, v, in, 2010, it, was, found, in, new, zealand, s, bay, of, plenty, region, kiwifruit, orchards, in, the, north, island, the, yellow, fleshed, cultivars, were, particularly, susceptible, new, resistant, varieties, were, selected, in, research, funded, by, the, government, and, fruit, growers, so, that, the, industry, could, continue, scientists, reported, they, had, worked, out, the, strain, of, psa, affecting, kiwifruit, from, new, zealand, italy, and, chile, originated, in, china, in, 2022, world, production, of, kiwifruit, was, 4, 5, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 52, of, the, total, in, china, kiwifruit, is, grown, mainly, in, the, mountainous, area, upstream, of, the, yangtze, river, as, well, as, sichuan, other, major, producers, were, new, zealand, and, italy, kiwifruit, exports, rapidly, increased, from, the, late, 1960s, to, early, 1970s, in, new, zealand, by, 1976, exports, exceeded, the, amount, consumed, domestically, outside, of, australasia, new, zealand, kiwifruit, are, marketed, under, the, brand, name, label, zespri, the, general, name, zespri, has, been, used, for, marketing, of, all, cultivars, of, kiwifruit, from, new, zealand, since, 2012, in, the, 1980s, many, countries, outside, new, zealand, began, to, grow, and, export, kiwifruit, in, italy, the, infrastructure, and, techniques, required, to, support, grape, production, were, adapted, to, the, kiwifruit, this, coupled, with, being, close, to, the, european, kiwifruit, market, led, to, italians, becoming, the, leading, producer, of, kiwifruit, in, 1989, the, growing, season, of, italian, kiwifruit, does, not, overlap, much, with, the, new, zealand, or, the, chilean, growing, seasons, therefore, direct, competition, between, new, zealand, or, chile, was, not, a, significant, factor, much, of, the, breeding, to, refine, the, green, kiwifruit, was, undertaken, by, the, plant, food, research, institute, formerly, hortresearch, during, the, decades, of, 1970, 1999, in, 1990, the, new, zealand, kiwifruit, marketing, board, opened, an, office, for, europe, in, antwerp, belgium, kiwifruit, may, be, eaten, raw, made, into, juices, used, in, baked, goods, prepared, with, meat, or, used, as, a, garnish, the, whole, fruit, including, the, skin, is, suitable, for, human, consumption, however, the, skin, of, the, fuzzy, varieties, is, often, discarded, due, to, its, texture, sliced, kiwifruit, has, long, been, used, as, a, garnish, atop, whipped, cream, on, pavlova, a, meringue, based, dessert, traditionally, in, china, kiwifruit, was, not, eaten, for, pleasure, but, was, given, as, medicine, to, children, to, help, them, grow, and, to, women, who, have, given, birth, to, help, them, recover, raw, kiwifruit, contains, actinidain, also, spelled, actinidin, which, is, commercially, useful, as, a, meat, tenderizer, and, possibly, as, a, digestive, aid, actinidain, also, makes, raw, kiwifruit, unsuitable, for, use, in, desserts, containing, milk, or, any, other, dairy, products, because, the, enzyme, digests, milk, proteins, this, applies, to, gelatin, based, desserts, due, to, the, fact, that, the, actinidain, will, dissolve, the, proteins, in, gelatin, causing, the, dessert, to, either, liquefy, or, prevent, it, from, solidifying, in, a, 100, gram, 3, 5, oz, amount, green, kiwifruit, provides, 255, kilojoules, 61, kilocalories, of, food, energy, is, 83, water, and, 15, carbohydrates, with, negligible, protein, and, fat, table, it, is, particularly, rich, in, vitamin, c, 103, dv, and, vitamin, k, 34, dv, has, a, moderate, content, of, vitamin, e, 10, dv, with, no, other, micronutrients, in, significant, content, gold, kiwifruit, has, similar, nutritional, value, to, green, kiwifruit, but, contains, higher, vitamin, c, content, 179, dv, and, insignificant, vitamin, k, content, table, kiwifruit, seed, oil, contains, on, average, 62, alpha, linolenic, acid, an, omega, 3, fatty, acid, kiwifruit, pulp, contains, carotenoids, such, as, provitamin, a, beta, carotene, lutein, and, zeaxanthin, allergy, to, kiwifruit, was, first, described, in, 1981, and, there, have, since, been, reports, of, the, allergy, presenting, with, numerous, symptoms, from, localized, oral, allergy, syndrome, to, life, threatening, anaphylaxis, the, actinidain, found, in, kiwifruit, can, be, an, allergen, for, some, individuals, including, children, the, most, common, symptoms, are, unpleasant, itching, and, soreness, of, the, mouth, with, wheezing, as, the, most, common, severe, symptom, anaphylaxis, may, occur
