the, alaska, pollock, or, walleye, pollock, gadus, chalcogrammus, is, a, marine, fish, species, of, the, cod, genus, gadus, and, family, gadidae, it, is, a, semi, pelagic, schooling, fish, widely, distributed, in, the, north, pacific, with, largest, concentrations, found, in, the, eastern, bering, sea, alaska, pollock, was, in, 1956, put, in, its, own, genus, theragra, and, classified, as, theragra, chalcogramma, but, research, in, 2008, has, shown, it, is, rather, closely, related, to, the, atlantic, cod, and, should, therefore, be, moved, back, to, gadus, where, it, was, originally, placed, in, 2014, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, announced, that, the, official, scientific, name, for, the, fish, was, changed, from, theragra, chalcogramma, back, to, its, original, taxon, gadus, chalcogrammus, highlighting, its, close, genetic, relationship, to, the, other, species, of, the, cod, genus, gadus, since, 2014, registries, of, scientific, names, for, fish, species, e, g, the, united, nations, asfis, list, and, the, world, registry, of, marine, species, worms, have, largely, adopted, the, gadus, chalcogrammus, name, the, change, of, the, official, scientific, name, was, followed, by, a, discussion, to, change, the, common, name, as, well, to, highlight, the, fish, as, a, member, of, the, cod, genus, the, common, names, alaska, pollock, and, walleye, pollock, both, used, as, trade, names, internationally, are, considered, misleading, by, scientific, and, trade, experts, as, the, names, do, not, reflect, the, scientific, classification, while, belonging, to, the, same, family, as, the, atlantic, pollock, the, alaska, pollock, is, not, a, member, of, the, genus, pollachius, but, of, the, cod, genus, gadus, nevertheless, alternative, trade, names, highlighting, its, placement, in, the, cod, genus, such, as, snow, cod, bigeye, cod, or, direct, deductions, from, the, scientific, names, such, as, copperline, cod, gadus, meaning, cod, latin, chalco, from, greek, khalk, s, meaning, copper, and, greek, gramm, meaning, line, or, lesser, cod, from, the, synonymous, taxon, gadus, minor, have, yet, to, find, widespread, acceptance, the, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, even, states, that, might, never, change, as, common, names, are, separate, from, scientific, names, in, addition, norwegian, pollock, theragra, finnmarchica, a, rare, fish, of, norwegian, waters, is, likely, the, same, species, as, the, alaska, pollock, the, speckled, coloring, of, alaska, pollock, makes, it, more, difficult, for, predators, to, see, them, when, they, are, near, sandy, ocean, floors, they, are, a, relatively, fast, growing, and, short, lived, species, currently, representing, a, major, biological, component, of, the, bering, sea, ecosystem, it, has, been, found, that, catches, of, alaska, pollock, go, up, three, years, after, stormy, summers, the, storms, stir, up, nutrients, and, this, results, in, phytoplankton, being, plentiful, for, longer, which, in, turn, allows, more, pollock, hatchlings, to, survive, the, alaska, pollock, has, well, developed, drumming, muscles, that, the, fish, use, to, produce, sounds, during, courtship, like, many, other, gadids, the, primary, factor, in, determining, the, foraging, behavior, of, the, alaskan, pollock, is, age, young, pollocks, can, be, divided, into, two, sub, groups, fish, with, lengths, below, 60, mm, 2, 1, 2, in, and, fish, greater, than, 60, mm, both, groups, mainly, feed, on, copepods, however, the, latter, group, will, also, forage, for, krill, therefore, food, depletion, has, a, larger, effect, on, smaller, pollock, the, variation, in, size, of, each, subgroup, also, affects, seasonal, foraging, behavior, during, the, winter, when, food, is, scarce, foraging, can, be, costly, due, to, the, fact, that, longer, hunting, time, increases, the, risk, of, meeting, a, predator, the, larger, young, pollocks, have, no, need, to, hunt, during, the, winter, because, they, have, a, higher, capacity, for, energy, storage, while, smaller, fish, do, not, and, have, to, continue, foraging, putting, them, at, greater, risk, to, maximize, their, chances, of, survival, large, pollock, increase, their, calorie, intake, in, autumn, to, gain, weight, while, smaller, ones, focus, solely, on, growing, in, size, alaskan, pollock, exhibit, diel, vertical, migration, following, the, seasonal, movement, of, their, food, although, pollocks, exhibit, vertical, movement, during, the, day, their, average, depth, changes, with, the, seasons, originally, the, change, in, depth, was, attributed, to, the, amount, of, light, or, water, temperature, but, in, fact, it, follows, the, movement, of, food, species, in, august, when, food, is, abundantly, available, near, the, surface, pollocks, will, be, found, at, shallower, depths, in, november, they, are, found, deeper, along, with, their, planktonic, food, source, the, alaska, pollock, s, main, habitats, are, the, coastal, areas, of, the, northern, pacific, especially, the, waters, off, alaska, eastern, bering, sea, gulf, of, alaska, aleutian, islands, as, well, as, off, russia, japan, and, korea, western, bering, sea, and, sea, of, okhotsk, the, largest, concentrations, of, alaska, pollock, are, found, in, the, eastern, bering, sea, very, small, populations, of, fish, genetically, identical, to, gadus, chalcogrammus, are, found, in, the, barents, sea, waters, of, northern, norway, and, russia, this, fish, was, initially, described, as, its, own, species, under, the, taxon, theragra, finnmarchica, by, norwegian, zoologist, einar, koefoed, in, 1956, the, common, name, used, for, the, fish, was, norway, pollock, genetic, analyses, have, shown, that, the, fish, is, genetically, identical, to, the, alaska, pollock, it, is, therefore, considered, to, be, conspecific, with, the, pacific, species, and, is, attributed, to, gadus, chalcogrammus, the, history, of, the, species, in, the, barents, sea, is, unknown, the, initial, specification, as, an, own, species, by, koefoed, was, based, on, two, specimens, landed, in, berlev, g, northern, norway, in, 1932, hence, the, norwegian, name, berlev, gfisk, based, on, morphological, differences, koefoed, considered, theragra, finnmarchica, a, new, species, related, to, but, separate, from, the, alaska, pollock, just, seven, specimens, of, the, fish, are, known, to, have, been, caught, between, 1957, and, early, 2002, in, the, arctic, ocean, in, 2003, and, 2004, 31, new, specimens, were, caught, all, specimens, were, large, 465, 687, mm, 18, 1, 4, 27, in, in, total, length, and, caught, in, the, coastal, waters, between, vester, len, in, the, west, and, varangerfjord, in, the, east, by, 2006, 54, individuals, had, been, recorded, sequencing, of, mitochondrial, dna, of, two, specimens, of, theragra, finnmarchica, and, 10, theragra, chalcogramma, today, gadus, chalcogrammus, revealed, no, significant, genetic, differences, leading, ursvik, et, al, to, suggest, that, t, finnmarchica, and, t, chalcogramma, are, the, same, species, an, analysis, of, a, much, larger, sample, size, 44, t, finnmarchica, and, 20, t, chalcogramma, using, both, genetic, and, morphological, methods, led, to, similar, conclusions, while, the, putative, species, could, not, be, separated, genetically, they, showed, some, consistent, differences, in, morphology, only, one, characteristic, showed, no, overlap, byrkjedal, et, al, conclude, that, t, finnmarchica, should, be, considered, a, junior, synonym, of, t, chalcogramma, these, analyses, also, suggest, that, t, finnmarchica, is, a, near, relative, of, the, atlantic, cod, and, that, both, alaska, and, norway, pollock, should, be, moved, to, genus, gadus, norway, pollock, theragra, finnmarchica, was, listed, as, near, threatened, in, the, 2010, norwegian, red, list, for, species, based, on, criteria, d1, very, small, or, geographically, very, restricted, population, number, of, mature, individuals, the, iucn, red, list, currently, lists, alaskan, pollock, as, near, threatened, in, europe, the, alaska, pollock, has, been, said, to, be, the, largest, remaining, source, of, palatable, fish, in, the, world, around, 3, million, metric, tons, 3, 000, 000, long, tons, 3, 300, 000, short, tons, of, alaska, pollock, are, caught, each, year, in, the, north, pacific, from, alaska, to, northern, japan, alaska, pollock, is, the, world, s, second, most, important, fish, species, after, the, peruvian, anchoveta, in, terms, of, total, catch, alaska, pollock, landings, are, the, largest, of, any, single, fish, species, in, the, u, s, with, the, average, annual, eastern, bering, sea, catch, between, 1979, and, 2022, being, 1, 26, million, metric, tons, alaska, pollock, catches, from, u, s, fisheries, have, been, relatively, consistent, at, approximately, 1, 3, million, tons, a, year, on, average, 92, percent, from, the, bering, sea, and, 8, percent, from, the, gulf, of, alaska, each, year, s, quota, is, adjusted, based, on, stock, assessments, conducted, by, the, alaska, fisheries, science, center, to, prevent, overfishing, for, example, quotas, were, reduced, from, 2008, to, 2010, in, the, bering, sea, due, to, stock, declines, independent, certification, groups, have, hailed, the, fishery, as, an, example, of, good, management, for, example, the, gulf, of, alaska, and, bering, sea, aleutian, islands, fisheries, were, separately, certified, as, sustainable, by, the, marine, stewardship, council, msc, in, 2005, and, were, certified, in, 2010, and, 2016, the, fisheries, received, a, combined, re, certification, in, 2020, the, marine, conservation, society, rates, alaska, pollock, harvested, from, the, gulf, of, alaska, bering, sea, and, aleutian, islands, as, sustainable, but, not, those, from, the, western, bering, sea, in, russian, waters, in, 2021, the, msc, awarded, the, u, s, trade, associations, association, of, genuine, alaska, pollock, producers, gapp, and, at, sea, processors, association, with, its, ocean, champion, award, that, recognizes, organizations, for, meeting, msc, s, commitment, to, a, healthier, ocean, and, a, more, transparent, supply, chain, the, msc, recognized, alaska, pollock, from, u, s, fisheries, as, one, of, the, healthiest, and, most, sustainable, sources, of, protein, compared, to, other, cod, species, and, pollock, alaska, pollock, has, a, milder, taste, whiter, color, and, lower, oil, content, high, quality, single, frozen, whole, alaska, pollock, fillets, may, be, layered, into, a, block, mold, and, deep, frozen, to, produce, fish, blocks, that, are, used, throughout, europe, and, north, america, as, the, raw, material, for, high, quality, breaded, and, battered, fish, products, lower, quality, double, frozen, fillets, or, minced, trim, pieces, may, also, be, frozen, in, block, forms, and, used, as, raw, material, for, lower, quality, low, cost, breaded, and, battered, fish, sticks, and, portions, a, life, cycle, assessment, on, the, carbon, footprint, of, alaska, pollock, performed, by, a, sustainability, consulting, firm, showed, that, alaska, pollock, fillet, has, a, lower, carbon, footprint, and, delivers, more, protein, per, kilogram, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, than, many, other, animal, proteins, including, beef, chicken, cod, and, even, plant, based, options, alaska, pollock, is, commonly, used, in, the, fast, food, industry, in, products, such, as, mcdonald, s, filet, o, fish, sandwich, burger, king, big, fish, sandwich, wendy, s, crispy, panko, fish, sandwich, arby, s, king, s, hawaiian, fish, deluxe, arby, s, crispy, fish, sandwich, arby, s, spicy, fish, sandwich, long, john, silver, s, baja, fish, taco, bojangles, bojangular, birds, eye, s, fish, fingers, in, crispy, batter, 7, eleven, s, fish, bites, white, castle, s, panko, breaded, fish, sliders, and, captain, d, s, seafood, kitchen, some, of, these, items, are, seasonal, offerings, to, coincide, with, the, lent, calendar, where, seafood, demand, is, higher, single, frozen, alaska, pollock, is, considered, to, be, the, premier, raw, material, for, surimi, the, most, common, use, of, surimi, in, the, united, states, is, imitation, crabmeat, though, it, is, often, seen, labeled, in, retailers, and, grocers, as, surimi, seafood, sticks, flakes, or, chunks, there, are, five, main, forms, of, surimi, seafood, chunk, leg, flake, salad, and, shred, surimi, made, from, minced, alaska, pollock, retains, the, aforementioned, carbon, footprint, advantage, pollock, roe, is, a, popular, culinary, ingredient, in, korea, japan, and, russia, in, korea, the, roe, is, called, myeongnan, literally, alaska, pollock, s, roe, and, the, salted, roe, is, called, myeongnan, jeot, literally, pollock, roe, jeotgal, the, food, was, introduced, to, japan, after, world, war, ii, and, since, has, been, called, mentai, ko, in, japanese, a, milder, less, spicy, version, is, usually, called, tarako, literally, cod, s, roe, which, is, also, the, japanese, name, for, pollock, roe, itself, in, russia, pollock, roe, is, consumed, as, a, sandwich, spread, the, product, resembling, liquid, paste, due, to, the, small, size, of, eggs, and, oil, added, is, sold, canned, alaska, pollock, is, considered, the, national, fish, of, korea, the, korean, name, of, the, fish, myeongtae, has, also, spread, to, some, neighbouring, countries, it, is, called, mintay, in, russia, and, its, roe, is, called, mentaiko, in, japan, although, the, japanese, name, for, the, fish, itself, is, suket, dara, in, korea, myeongtae, is, called, thirty, odd, additional, names, including, saengtae, fresh, dongtae, frozen, bugeo, dried, hwangtae, dried, in, winter, with, repeated, freezing, and, thawing, nogari, dried, young, and, kodari, half, dried, young, koreans, have, been, eating, alaska, pollock, since, the, joseon, era, one, of, the, earliest, mentions, is, from, seungjeongwon, ilgi, journal, of, the, royal, secretariat, where, a, 1652, entry, stated, the, management, administration, should, be, strictly, interrogated, for, bringing, in, pollock, roe, instead, of, cod, roe, alaska, pollocks, were, the, most, commonly, caught, fish, in, korea, in, 1940, when, more, than, 270, 000, tonnes, were, caught, from, the, sea, of, japan, it, outnumbers, the, current, annual, consumption, of, alaska, pollock, in, south, korea, estimated, at, 260, 000, tonnes, in, 2016, nowadays, however, alaska, pollock, consumption, in, south, korea, rely, heavily, on, import, from, russia, due, to, rises, in, sea, water, temperatures, in, 2019, south, korea, imposed, a, total, ban, on, pollock, fishing, to, help, replenish, depleted, stocks, of, the, fish
