microbats, constitute, the, suborder, microchiroptera, within, the, order, chiroptera, bats, bats, have, long, been, differentiated, into, megachiroptera, megabats, and, microchiroptera, based, on, their, size, the, use, of, echolocation, by, the, microchiroptera, and, other, features, molecular, evidence, suggests, a, somewhat, different, subdivision, as, the, microbats, have, been, shown, to, be, a, paraphyletic, group, microbats, are, 4, to, 16, cm, 1, 6, 6, 3, in, long, most, microbats, feed, on, insects, but, some, of, the, larger, species, hunt, birds, lizards, frogs, smaller, bats, or, even, fish, only, three, species, of, microbat, feed, on, the, blood, of, large, mammals, or, birds, vampire, bats, these, bats, live, in, south, and, central, america, although, most, leaf, nose, microbats, are, fruit, and, nectar, eating, the, name, leaf, nosed, isn, t, a, designation, meant, to, indicate, the, preferred, diet, among, said, variety, three, species, follow, the, bloom, of, columnar, cacti, in, northwest, mexico, and, the, southwest, united, states, northward, in, the, northern, spring, and, then, the, blooming, agaves, southward, in, the, northern, fall, autumn, other, leaf, nosed, bats, such, as, vampyrum, spectrum, of, south, america, hunt, a, variety, of, prey, such, as, lizards, and, birds, the, horseshoe, bats, of, europe, as, well, as, california, leaf, nosed, bats, have, a, very, intricate, leaf, nose, for, echolocation, and, feed, primarily, on, insects, the, form, and, function, of, microbat, teeth, differ, as, a, result, of, the, various, diets, these, bats, can, have, teeth, are, primarily, designed, to, break, down, food, therefore, the, shape, of, the, teeth, correlate, to, specific, feeding, behaviors, in, comparison, to, megabats, which, feed, only, on, fruit, and, nectar, microbats, illustrate, a, range, of, diets, and, have, been, classified, as, insectivores, carnivores, sanguinivores, frugivores, and, nectarivores, differences, seen, between, the, size, and, function, of, the, canines, and, molars, among, microbats, in, these, groups, vary, as, a, result, of, this, the, diverse, diets, of, microbats, reflect, having, dentition, or, cheek, teeth, that, display, a, morphology, derived, from, dilambdodont, teeth, which, are, characterized, by, a, w, shaped, ectoloph, or, stylar, shelf, a, w, shaped, dilambdodont, upper, molar, includes, a, metacone, and, paracone, which, are, located, at, the, bottom, of, the, w, while, the, rest, of, the, w, is, formed, by, crests, that, run, from, the, metacone, and, paracone, to, the, cusps, of, the, stylar, self, microbats, display, differences, between, the, size, and, shape, of, their, canines, and, molars, in, addition, to, having, distinctive, variations, among, their, skull, features, that, contribute, to, their, ability, to, feed, effectively, frugivorous, microbats, have, small, stylar, shelf, areas, short, molariform, rows, and, wide, palates, and, faces, in, addition, to, having, wide, faces, frugivorous, microbats, have, short, skulls, which, place, the, teeth, closer, to, the, fulcrum, of, the, jaw, lever, allowing, an, increase, in, jaw, strength, frugivorous, microbats, also, possess, a, different, pattern, on, their, molars, compared, to, carnivorous, insectivorous, nectarivorous, and, sanguinivorous, microbats, in, contrast, insectivorous, microbats, are, characterized, by, having, larger, but, fewer, teeth, long, canines, and, shortened, third, upper, molars, while, carnivorous, microbats, have, large, upper, molars, generally, microbats, that, are, insectivores, carnivores, and, frugivores, have, large, teeth, and, small, palates, however, the, opposite, is, true, for, microbats, that, are, nectarivores, though, differences, exist, between, the, palate, and, teeth, sizes, of, microbats, the, proportion, of, the, sizes, of, these, two, structures, are, maintained, among, microbats, of, various, sizes, echolocation, is, the, process, where, an, animal, produces, a, sound, of, certain, wavelength, and, then, listens, to, and, compares, the, reflected, echoes, to, the, original, sound, emitted, bats, use, echolocation, to, form, images, of, their, surrounding, environment, and, the, organisms, that, inhabit, it, by, eliciting, ultrasonic, waves, via, their, larynx, the, difference, between, the, ultrasonic, waves, produced, by, the, bat, and, what, the, bat, hears, provides, the, bat, with, information, about, its, environment, echolocation, aids, the, bat, in, not, only, detecting, prey, but, also, in, orientation, during, flight, most, microbats, generate, ultrasound, with, their, larynx, and, emit, the, sound, through, their, nose, or, mouth, sound, productions, are, generated, from, the, vocal, folds, in, mammals, due, to, the, elastic, membranes, that, compose, these, folds, vocalization, requires, these, elastic, membranes, because, they, act, as, a, source, to, transform, airflow, into, acoustic, pressure, waves, energy, is, supplied, to, the, elastic, membranes, from, the, lungs, and, results, in, the, production, of, sound, the, larynx, houses, the, vocal, cords, and, forms, the, passageway, for, the, expiratory, air, that, will, produce, sound, microbat, calls, range, in, frequency, from, 14, 000, to, over, 100, 000, hertz, well, beyond, the, range, of, the, human, ear, typical, human, hearing, range, is, considered, to, be, from, 20, to, 20, 000, hz, the, emitted, vocalizations, form, a, broad, beam, of, sound, used, to, probe, the, environment, as, well, as, communicate, with, other, bats, at, the, molecular, level, it, has, been, found, that, cplx1, is, involved, in, this, ultrasonic, wave, production, laryngeal, echolocation, is, the, dominant, form, of, echolocation, in, microbats, however, it, is, not, the, only, way, in, which, microbats, can, produce, ultrasonic, waves, excluding, non, echolocating, and, laryngeally, echolocating, microbats, other, species, of, microbats, and, megabats, have, been, shown, to, produce, ultrasonic, waves, by, clapping, their, wings, clicking, their, tongues, or, using, their, nose, laryngeally, echolocating, bats, in, general, produce, ultrasonic, waves, with, their, larynx, that, is, specialized, to, produce, sounds, of, short, wavelength, the, larynx, is, located, at, the, cranial, end, of, the, trachea, and, is, surrounded, by, cricothyroid, muscles, and, thyroid, cartilage, for, reference, in, humans, this, is, the, area, where, the, adam, s, apple, is, located, phonation, of, ultrasonic, waves, is, produced, through, the, vibrations, of, the, vocal, membranes, in, the, expiratory, air, the, intensity, that, these, vocal, folds, vibrate, at, varies, with, activity, and, between, bat, species, a, characteristic, of, laryngeally, echolocating, microbats, that, distinguishes, them, from, other, echolocating, microbats, is, the, articulation, of, their, stylohyal, bone, with, their, tympanic, bone, the, stylohyal, bones, are, part, of, the, hyoid, apparatus, that, help, support, the, throat, and, larynx, the, tympanic, bone, forms, the, floor, of, the, middle, ear, in, addition, to, the, connection, between, the, stylohyal, bone, and, the, tympanic, bone, as, being, an, indicator, of, laryngeally, echolocating, microbats, another, definitive, marker, is, the, presence, of, a, flattened, and, expanded, stylohyal, bone, at, the, cranial, end, microbats, that, laryngeally, echolocate, must, be, able, to, distinguish, between, the, differences, of, the, pulse, that, they, produce, and, the, returning, echo, that, follows, by, being, able, to, process, and, understand, the, ultrasonic, waves, at, a, neuronal, level, in, order, to, accurately, obtain, information, about, their, surrounding, environment, and, orientation, in, it, the, connection, between, the, stylohyal, bone, and, the, tympanic, bone, enables, the, bat, to, neurally, register, the, outgoing, and, incoming, ultrasonic, waves, produced, by, the, larynx, furthermore, the, stylohyal, bones, connect, the, larynx, to, the, tympanic, bones, via, a, cartilaginous, or, fibrous, connection, depending, on, the, species, of, bat, mechanically, the, importance, of, this, connection, is, that, it, supports, the, larynx, by, anchoring, it, to, the, surrounding, cricothyroid, muscles, as, well, as, draws, it, closer, to, the, nasal, cavity, during, phonation, the, stylohyal, bones, are, often, reduced, in, many, other, mammals, however, they, are, more, prominent, in, laryngeally, echolocating, bats, and, are, part, of, the, mammalian, hyoid, apparatus, the, hyoid, apparatus, functions, in, breathing, swallowing, and, phonation, in, microbats, as, well, as, other, mammals, an, important, feature, of, the, bony, connection, in, laryngeally, echolocating, microbats, is, the, extended, articulation, of, the, ventral, portion, of, the, tympanic, bones, and, the, proximal, end, of, the, stylohyal, bone, that, bends, around, it, to, make, this, connection, while, bats, have, been, traditionally, divided, into, megabats, and, microbats, recent, molecular, evidence, has, shown, the, superfamily, rhinolophoidea, to, be, more, genetically, related, to, megabats, than, to, microbats, indicating, the, microbats, are, paraphyletic, to, resolve, the, paraphyly, of, microbats, the, chiroptera, were, redivided, into, suborders, yangochiroptera, which, includes, nycteridae, vespertilionoids, noctilionoids, and, emballonuroids, and, yinpterochiroptera, which, includes, megabats, rhinopomatids, rhinolophidae, and, megadermatidae, this, is, the, classification, according, to, simmons, and, geisler, 1998, superfamily, emballonuroidea, superfamily, rhinopomatoidea, superfamily, rhinolophoidea, superfamily, vespertilionoidea, superfamily, molossoidea, superfamily, nataloidea, superfamily, noctilionoidea
