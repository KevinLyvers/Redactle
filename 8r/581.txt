the, common, snapping, turtle, chelydra, serpentina, is, a, species, of, large, freshwater, turtle, in, the, family, chelydridae, its, natural, range, extends, from, southeastern, canada, southwest, to, the, edge, of, the, rocky, mountains, as, far, east, as, nova, scotia, and, florida, the, present, day, chelydra, serpentina, population, in, the, middle, rio, grande, suggests, that, common, snapping, turtle, has, been, present, in, this, drainage, since, at, least, the, seventeenth, century, and, is, likely, native, the, three, species, of, chelydra, and, the, larger, alligator, snapping, turtles, genus, macrochelys, are, the, only, extant, chelydrids, a, family, now, restricted, to, the, americas, the, common, snapping, turtle, as, its, name, implies, is, the, most, widespread, the, common, snapping, turtle, is, noted, for, its, combative, disposition, when, out, of, the, water, with, its, powerful, beak, like, jaws, and, highly, mobile, head, and, neck, hence, the, specific, epithet, serpentina, meaning, snake, like, in, water, it, is, likely, to, flee, and, hide, underwater, in, sediment, the, common, snapping, turtle, has, a, life, history, strategy, characterized, by, high, and, variable, mortality, of, embryos, and, hatchlings, delayed, sexual, maturity, extended, adult, longevity, and, iteroparity, repeated, reproductive, events, with, low, reproductive, success, per, reproductive, event, females, and, presumably, also, males, in, more, northern, populations, mature, later, at, 15, 20, years, and, at, a, larger, size, than, in, more, southern, populations, about, 12, years, lifespan, in, the, wild, is, poorly, known, but, long, term, mark, recapture, data, from, algonquin, park, in, ontario, canada, suggest, a, maximum, age, over, 100, years, c, serpentina, has, a, rugged, muscular, build, with, a, ridged, carapace, upper, shell, that, varies, in, color, from, tan, brown, and, black, although, ridges, tend, to, be, more, pronounced, in, younger, individuals, the, carapace, length, in, adulthood, may, be, nearly, 50, cm, 20, in, though, 25, 47, cm, 9, 8, 18, 5, in, is, more, common, c, serpentina, usually, weighs, 4, 5, 16, kg, 9, 9, 35, 3, lb, per, one, study, breeding, common, snapping, turtles, were, found, to, average, 28, 5, cm, 11, 2, in, in, carapace, length, 22, 5, cm, 8, 9, in, in, plastron, length, and, weigh, about, 6, kg, 13, lb, males, are, larger, than, females, with, almost, all, weighing, in, excess, of, 10, kg, 22, lb, being, male, and, quite, old, as, the, species, continues, to, grow, throughout, life, any, specimen, above, the, aforementioned, weights, is, exceptional, but, the, heaviest, wild, specimen, caught, reportedly, weighed, 34, kg, 75, lb, snapping, turtles, kept, in, captivity, can, be, quite, overweight, due, to, overfeeding, and, have, weighed, as, much, as, 39, kg, 86, lb, in, the, northern, part, of, its, range, the, common, snapping, turtle, is, often, the, heaviest, native, freshwater, turtle, according, to, a, study, by, nakamuta, et, al, 2016, common, snapping, turtles, have, well, developed, olfactory, organs, nerves, and, bulbs, that, suggest, that, this, species, has, a, great, sense, of, smell, common, habitats, are, shallow, ponds, or, streams, some, may, inhabit, brackish, environments, such, as, estuaries, these, sources, of, water, tend, to, have, an, abundance, of, aquatic, vegetation, due, to, the, shallow, pools, some, describe, them, as, habitat, generalists, as, they, can, occupy, most, permanent, bodies, of, water, common, snapping, turtles, sometimes, bask, though, rarely, observed, by, floating, on, the, surface, with, only, their, carapaces, exposed, though, in, the, northern, parts, of, their, range, they, also, readily, bask, on, fallen, logs, in, early, spring, in, shallow, waters, common, snapping, turtles, may, lie, beneath, a, muddy, bottom, with, only, their, heads, exposed, stretching, their, long, necks, to, the, surface, for, an, occasional, breath, their, nostrils, are, positioned, on, the, very, tip, of, the, snout, effectively, functioning, as, snorkels, snapping, turtles, are, omnivorous, important, aquatic, scavengers, they, are, also, active, hunters, that, use, ambush, tactics, to, prey, on, anything, they, can, swallow, including, many, invertebrates, fish, frogs, other, amphibians, reptiles, including, snakes, and, smaller, turtles, unwary, birds, and, small, mammals, in, a, recent, study, young, common, snapping, turtles, showed, that, their, lower, bite, force, matches, their, active, foraging, behavior, meaning, they, have, to, travel, and, seek, out, more, prey, to, make, up, for, their, inability, to, eat, some, items, in, some, areas, adult, snapping, turtles, can, occasionally, be, incidentally, detrimental, to, breeding, waterfowl, but, their, effect, on, such, prey, as, ducklings, and, goslings, is, frequently, exaggerated, as, omnivorous, scavengers, though, they, will, also, feed, on, carrion, and, a, surprisingly, large, amount, of, aquatic, vegetation, common, snapping, turtles, have, few, predators, when, older, but, eggs, are, subject, to, predation, by, crows, american, mink, skunks, foxes, and, raccoons, egg, predators, use, three, types, of, cues, to, locate, turtle, nests, as, hatchlings, and, juveniles, most, of, the, same, predators, will, attack, them, as, well, as, herons, mostly, great, blue, herons, bitterns, hawks, owls, fishers, american, bullfrogs, large, fish, and, snakes, there, are, records, during, winter, in, canada, of, hibernating, adult, common, snapping, turtles, being, ambushed, and, preyed, on, by, northern, river, otters, other, natural, predators, which, have, reportedly, preyed, on, adults, include, coyotes, american, black, bears, american, alligators, and, their, larger, cousins, alligator, snapping, turtles, large, old, male, snapping, turtles, have, very, few, natural, threats, due, to, their, formidable, size, and, defenses, and, tend, to, have, a, very, low, annual, mortality, rate, these, turtles, travel, extensively, over, land, to, reach, new, habitats, or, to, lay, eggs, pollution, habitat, destruction, food, scarcity, overcrowding, and, other, factors, drive, snappers, to, move, it, is, quite, common, to, find, them, traveling, far, from, the, nearest, water, source, experimental, data, supports, the, idea, that, snapping, turtles, can, sense, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, which, could, also, be, used, for, such, movements, together, with, a, variety, of, other, possible, orientation, cues, this, species, mates, from, april, through, november, with, their, peak, laying, season, in, june, and, july, the, female, can, hold, sperm, for, several, seasons, using, it, as, necessary, females, travel, over, land, to, find, sandy, soil, in, which, to, lay, their, eggs, often, some, distance, from, the, water, after, digging, a, hole, the, female, typically, deposits, 25, to, 80, eggs, each, year, guiding, them, into, the, nest, with, her, hind, feet, and, covering, them, with, sand, for, incubation, and, protection, these, eggs, have, a, leathery, flexible, shell, and, they, typically, measure, only, 26, 28, mm, in, diameter, incubation, time, is, temperature, dependent, ranging, from, 9, to, 18, weeks, one, study, on, the, incubation, period, of, the, common, snapping, turtle, incubated, the, eggs, at, two, temperatures, 20, c, 68, f, and, 30, c, 86, f, the, research, found, that, the, incubation, period, at, the, higher, temperature, was, significantly, shorter, at, approximately, 63, days, while, at, the, lower, temperature, the, time, was, approximately, 140, days, in, cooler, climates, hatchlings, overwinter, in, the, nest, the, common, snapping, turtle, is, remarkably, cold, tolerant, radiotelemetry, studies, have, shown, some, individuals, do, not, hibernate, but, remain, active, under, the, ice, during, the, winter, in, addition, to, incubation, time, temperature, also, affects, sex, determination, it, has, been, shown, that, females, develop, at, low, and, high, temperatures, while, males, develop, in, the, intermediate, temperature, range, fall, temperatures, had, a, positive, effect, on, clutch, size, and, clutch, mass, whereas, spring, temperatures, had, no, impact, common, snapping, turtle, hatchlings, have, recently, been, found, to, make, sounds, before, nest, exit, onto, the, surface, a, phenomenon, also, known, from, species, in, the, south, american, genus, podocnemis, and, the, ouachita, map, turtle, these, sounds, are, mostly, clicking, noises, but, other, sounds, including, those, that, sound, somewhat, like, a, creak, or, rubbing, a, finger, along, a, fine, toothed, comb, are, also, sometimes, produced, in, the, northern, part, of, their, range, snapping, turtles, do, not, breathe, for, more, than, six, months, because, ice, covers, their, hibernating, site, these, turtles, can, get, oxygen, by, pushing, their, head, out, of, the, mud, and, allowing, gas, exchange, to, take, place, through, the, membranes, of, their, mouth, and, throat, this, is, known, as, extrapulmonary, respiration, if, they, cannot, get, enough, oxygen, through, this, method, they, start, to, utilize, anaerobic, pathways, burning, sugars, and, fats, without, the, use, of, oxygen, the, metabolic, by, products, from, this, process, are, acidic, and, create, very, undesirable, side, effects, by, spring, which, are, known, as, oxygen, debt, although, designated, as, least, concern, on, the, iucn, redlist, the, species, has, been, designated, in, the, canadian, part, of, its, range, as, special, concern, due, to, its, life, history, being, sensitive, to, disruption, by, anthropogenic, activity, currently, no, subspecies, of, the, common, snapping, turtle, are, recognized, the, former, florida, subspecies, osceola, is, currently, considered, a, synonym, of, serpentina, while, the, other, former, subspecies, chelydra, rossignonii, and, chelydra, acutirostris, are, both, recognized, as, full, species, in, their, environment, they, are, at, the, top, of, the, food, chain, causing, them, to, feel, less, fear, or, aggression, in, some, cases, when, they, encounter, a, species, unfamiliar, to, them, such, as, humans, in, rare, instances, they, will, become, curious, and, survey, the, situation, and, even, more, rarely, may, bump, their, nose, on, a, leg, of, the, person, standing, in, the, water, although, snapping, turtles, have, fierce, dispositions, when, they, are, encountered, in, the, water, or, a, swimmer, approaches, they, will, slip, quietly, away, from, any, disturbance, or, may, seek, shelter, under, mud, or, grass, nearby, the, common, snapping, turtle, is, a, traditional, ingredient, in, turtle, soup, consumption, in, large, quantities, however, can, become, a, health, concern, due, to, potential, concentration, of, toxic, environmental, pollutants, in, the, turtle, s, flesh, the, common, snapping, turtle, is, not, an, ideal, pet, its, neck, is, very, flexible, and, a, wild, turtle, can, bite, its, handler, even, if, picked, up, by, the, sides, of, its, shell, the, claws, are, as, sharp, as, those, of, bears, and, cannot, be, trimmed, as, can, dog, claws, the, turtle, uses, its, paws, like, a, bear, for, hunting, and, slicing, food, while, biting, it, despite, this, a, snapping, turtle, cannot, use, its, claws, for, either, attacking, its, legs, have, no, speed, or, strength, in, swiping, motions, or, eating, no, opposable, thumbs, but, only, as, aids, for, digging, and, gripping, veterinary, care, is, best, left, to, a, reptile, specialist, a, wild, common, snapping, turtle, will, make, a, hissing, sound, when, it, is, threatened, or, encountered, but, they, prefer, not, to, provoke, confrontations, it, is, a, common, misconception, that, common, snapping, turtles, may, be, safely, picked, up, by, the, tail, with, no, harm, to, the, animal, in, fact, this, has, a, high, chance, of, injuring, the, turtle, especially, the, tail, itself, and, the, vertebral, column, lifting, the, turtle, with, the, hands, is, difficult, and, dangerous, snappers, can, stretch, their, necks, back, across, their, own, carapace, and, to, their, hind, feet, on, either, side, to, bite, when, they, feel, stressed, they, release, a, musky, odor, from, behind, their, legs, it, may, be, tempting, to, rescue, a, snapping, turtle, found, on, a, road, by, getting, it, to, bite, a, stick, and, then, dragging, it, out, of, immediate, danger, this, action, can, however, severely, scrape, the, legs, and, underside, of, the, turtle, and, lead, to, deadly, infections, in, the, wounds, the, safest, way, to, pick, up, a, common, snapping, turtle, is, by, grasping, the, carapace, behind, the, back, legs, being, careful, to, not, grasp, the, tail, there, is, a, large, gap, behind, the, back, legs, that, allows, for, easy, grasping, of, the, carapace, and, keeps, hands, safe, from, both, the, beak, and, claws, of, the, turtle, it, can, also, be, picked, up, with, a, shovel, from, the, back, making, sure, the, shovel, is, square, across, the, bottom, of, the, shell, the, easiest, way, though, is, with, a, blanket, or, tarp, picking, up, the, corners, with, the, turtle, in, the, middle, snapping, turtles, are, raised, on, some, turtle, farms, in, mainland, china, the, common, snapping, turtle, was, the, central, feature, of, a, famous, american, political, cartoon, published, in, 1808, in, protest, at, the, jeffersonian, embargo, act, of, 1807, the, cartoon, depicted, a, snapping, turtle, jaws, locked, fiercely, to, an, american, trader, who, was, attempting, to, carry, a, barrel, of, goods, onto, a, british, ship, the, trader, was, seen, whimsically, uttering, the, words, oh, this, cursed, ograbme, embargo, spelled, backwards, and, also, o, grab, me, as, the, turtle, is, doing, this, piece, is, widely, considered, a, pioneering, work, within, the, genre, of, the, modern, political, cartoon, in, 2006, the, common, snapping, turtle, was, declared, the, state, reptile, of, new, york, by, vote, of, the, new, york, legislature, after, being, chosen, by, the, state, s, public, elementary, school, children, while, it, is, widely, rumored, that, common, snapping, turtles, can, bite, off, human, fingers, or, toes, and, their, powerful, jaws, are, more, than, capable, of, doing, so, no, proven, cases, have, ever, been, presented, for, this, species, as, they, use, their, overall, size, and, strength, to, deter, would, be, predators, common, snapping, turtles, are, quite, docile, animals, underwater, that, prefer, to, avoid, confrontations, rather, than, provoke, them, the, ability, to, bite, forcefully, is, extremely, useful, for, consuming, hard, bodied, prey, items, such, as, mollusks, crustaceans, and, turtles, along, with, some, plant, matter, like, nuts, and, seeds, in, 2002, a, study, done, in, the, journal, of, evolutionary, biology, found, that, the, common, snapping, turtle, chelydra, serpentina, registered, between, 208, and, 226, newtons, of, force, when, it, came, to, jaw, strength, in, comparison, the, average, bite, force, of, a, human, molars, area, is, between, 300, and, 700, newtons, another, non, closely, related, species, known, as, the, alligator, snapping, turtle, has, been, known, to, bite, off, fingers, and, at, least, three, documented, cases, are, known, in, recent, years, in, italy, large, mature, adult, c, serpentina, turtles, have, been, taken, from, bodies, of, water, throughout, the, country, they, were, most, probably, introduced, by, the, release, of, unwanted, pets, in, march, 2011, an, individual, weighing, 20, kg, 44, lb, was, captured, in, a, canal, near, rome, another, individual, was, captured, near, rome, in, september, 2012, in, japan, the, species, was, introduced, as, an, exotic, pet, in, the, 1960s, it, has, been, recorded, as, the, source, of, serious, bite, injuries, in, 2004, and, 2005, some, 1, 000, individuals, were, found, in, chiba, prefecture, making, up, the, majority, of, individuals, believed, to, have, been, introduced, the, species, is, currently, classified, as, least, concern, by, the, iucn, but, has, declined, sufficiently, due, to, pressure, from, collection, for, the, pet, trade, and, habitat, degradation, that, canada, and, several, u, s, states, have, enacted, or, are, proposing, stricter, conservation, measures, in, canada, it, is, listed, as, special, concern, in, the, species, at, risk, act, in, 2011, and, is, a, target, species, for, projects, that, include, surveys, identification, of, major, habitats, investigation, and, mitigation, of, threats, and, education, of, the, public, including, landowners, involved, bodies, include, governmental, departments, universities, museums, and, citizen, science, projects, although, common, snapping, turtles, are, listed, as, a, species, of, least, concern, anthropogenic, factors, still, may, have, major, effects, on, populations, decades, of, road, mortality, may, cause, severe, population, decline, in, common, snapping, turtle, populations, present, in, urbanized, wetlands, a, study, in, southwestern, ontario, monitored, a, population, near, a, busy, roadway, and, found, a, loss, of, 764, individuals, in, only, 17, years, the, population, decreased, from, 941, individuals, in, 1985, to, 177, individuals, in, 2002, road, mortality, may, put, common, snapping, turtle, populations, at, risk, of, extirpation, exclusion, fencing, could, aid, in, decreasing, population, loss
