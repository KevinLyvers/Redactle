the, cell, is, the, basic, structural, and, functional, unit, of, all, forms, of, life, every, cell, consists, of, cytoplasm, enclosed, within, a, membrane, many, cells, contain, organelles, each, with, a, specific, function, the, term, comes, from, the, latin, word, cellula, meaning, small, room, most, cells, are, only, visible, under, a, microscope, cells, emerged, on, earth, about, 4, billion, years, ago, all, cells, are, capable, of, replication, protein, synthesis, and, motility, cells, are, broadly, categorized, into, two, types, eukaryotic, cells, which, possess, a, nucleus, and, prokaryotic, cells, which, lack, a, nucleus, but, have, a, nucleoid, region, prokaryotes, are, single, celled, organisms, such, as, bacteria, whereas, eukaryotes, can, be, either, single, celled, such, as, amoebae, or, multicellular, such, as, some, algae, plants, animals, and, fungi, eukaryotic, cells, contain, organelles, including, mitochondria, which, provide, energy, for, cell, functions, chloroplasts, which, create, sugars, by, photosynthesis, in, plants, and, ribosomes, which, synthesise, proteins, cells, were, discovered, by, robert, hooke, in, 1665, who, named, them, after, their, resemblance, to, cells, inhabited, by, christian, monks, in, a, monastery, cell, theory, developed, in, 1839, by, matthias, jakob, schleiden, and, theodor, schwann, states, that, all, organisms, are, composed, of, one, or, more, cells, that, cells, are, the, fundamental, unit, of, structure, and, function, in, all, living, organisms, and, that, all, cells, come, from, pre, existing, cells, cells, are, broadly, categorized, into, two, types, eukaryotic, cells, which, possess, a, nucleus, and, prokaryotic, cells, which, lack, a, nucleus, but, have, a, nucleoid, region, prokaryotes, are, single, celled, organisms, whereas, eukaryotes, can, be, either, single, celled, or, multicellular, prokaryotes, include, bacteria, and, archaea, two, of, the, three, domains, of, life, prokaryotic, cells, were, the, first, form, of, life, on, earth, characterized, by, having, vital, biological, processes, including, cell, signaling, they, are, simpler, and, smaller, than, eukaryotic, cells, and, lack, a, nucleus, and, other, membrane, bound, organelles, the, dna, of, a, prokaryotic, cell, consists, of, a, single, circular, chromosome, that, is, in, direct, contact, with, the, cytoplasm, the, nuclear, region, in, the, cytoplasm, is, called, the, nucleoid, most, prokaryotes, are, the, smallest, of, all, organisms, ranging, from, 0, 5, to, 2, 0, m, in, diameter, a, prokaryotic, cell, has, three, regions, plants, animals, fungi, slime, moulds, protozoa, and, algae, are, all, eukaryotic, these, cells, are, about, fifteen, times, wider, than, a, typical, prokaryote, and, can, be, as, much, as, a, thousand, times, greater, in, volume, the, main, distinguishing, feature, of, eukaryotes, as, compared, to, prokaryotes, is, compartmentalization, the, presence, of, membrane, bound, organelles, compartments, in, which, specific, activities, take, place, most, important, among, these, is, a, cell, nucleus, an, organelle, that, houses, the, cell, s, dna, this, nucleus, gives, the, eukaryote, its, name, which, means, true, kernel, nucleus, some, of, the, other, differences, are, many, groups, of, eukaryotes, are, single, celled, among, the, many, celled, groups, are, animals, and, plants, the, number, of, cells, in, these, groups, vary, with, species, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, human, body, contains, around, 37, trillion, 3, 72, 10, 13, cells, and, more, recent, studies, put, this, number, at, around, 30, trillion, 36, trillion, cells, in, the, male, 28, trillion, in, the, female, all, cells, whether, prokaryotic, or, eukaryotic, have, a, membrane, that, envelops, the, cell, regulates, what, moves, in, and, out, selectively, permeable, and, maintains, the, electric, potential, of, the, cell, inside, the, membrane, the, cytoplasm, takes, up, most, of, the, cell, s, volume, except, red, blood, cells, which, lack, a, cell, nucleus, and, most, organelles, to, accommodate, maximum, space, for, hemoglobin, all, cells, possess, dna, the, hereditary, material, of, genes, and, rna, containing, the, information, necessary, to, build, various, proteins, such, as, enzymes, the, cell, s, primary, machinery, there, are, also, other, kinds, of, biomolecules, in, cells, this, article, lists, these, primary, cellular, components, then, briefly, describes, their, function, the, cell, membrane, or, plasma, membrane, is, a, selectively, permeable, biological, membrane, that, surrounds, the, cytoplasm, of, a, cell, in, animals, the, plasma, membrane, is, the, outer, boundary, of, the, cell, while, in, plants, and, prokaryotes, it, is, usually, covered, by, a, cell, wall, this, membrane, serves, to, separate, and, protect, a, cell, from, its, surrounding, environment, and, is, made, mostly, from, a, double, layer, of, phospholipids, which, are, amphiphilic, partly, hydrophobic, and, partly, hydrophilic, hence, the, layer, is, called, a, phospholipid, bilayer, or, sometimes, a, fluid, mosaic, membrane, embedded, within, this, membrane, is, a, macromolecular, structure, called, the, porosome, the, universal, secretory, portal, in, cells, and, a, variety, of, protein, molecules, that, act, as, channels, and, pumps, that, move, different, molecules, into, and, out, of, the, cell, the, membrane, is, semi, permeable, and, selectively, permeable, in, that, it, can, either, let, a, substance, molecule, or, ion, pass, through, freely, to, a, limited, extent, or, not, at, all, cell, surface, membranes, also, contain, receptor, proteins, that, allow, cells, to, detect, external, signaling, molecules, such, as, hormones, the, cytoskeleton, acts, to, organize, and, maintain, the, cell, s, shape, anchors, organelles, in, place, helps, during, endocytosis, the, uptake, of, external, materials, by, a, cell, and, cytokinesis, the, separation, of, daughter, cells, after, cell, division, and, moves, parts, of, the, cell, in, processes, of, growth, and, mobility, the, eukaryotic, cytoskeleton, is, composed, of, microtubules, intermediate, filaments, and, microfilaments, in, the, cytoskeleton, of, a, neuron, the, intermediate, filaments, are, known, as, neurofilaments, there, are, a, great, number, of, proteins, associated, with, them, each, controlling, a, cell, s, structure, by, directing, bundling, and, aligning, filaments, the, prokaryotic, cytoskeleton, is, less, well, studied, but, is, involved, in, the, maintenance, of, cell, shape, polarity, and, cytokinesis, the, subunit, protein, of, microfilaments, is, a, small, monomeric, protein, called, actin, the, subunit, of, microtubules, is, a, dimeric, molecule, called, tubulin, intermediate, filaments, are, heteropolymers, whose, subunits, vary, among, the, cell, types, in, different, tissues, some, of, the, subunit, proteins, of, intermediate, filaments, include, vimentin, desmin, lamin, lamins, a, b, and, c, keratin, multiple, acidic, and, basic, keratins, and, neurofilament, proteins, nf, l, nf, m, two, different, kinds, of, genetic, material, exist, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, and, ribonucleic, acid, rna, cells, use, dna, for, their, long, term, information, storage, the, biological, information, contained, in, an, organism, is, encoded, in, its, dna, sequence, rna, is, used, for, information, transport, e, g, mrna, and, enzymatic, functions, e, g, ribosomal, rna, transfer, rna, trna, molecules, are, used, to, add, amino, acids, during, protein, translation, prokaryotic, genetic, material, is, organized, in, a, simple, circular, bacterial, chromosome, in, the, nucleoid, region, of, the, cytoplasm, eukaryotic, genetic, material, is, divided, into, different, linear, molecules, called, chromosomes, inside, a, discrete, nucleus, usually, with, additional, genetic, material, in, some, organelles, like, mitochondria, and, chloroplasts, see, endosymbiotic, theory, a, human, cell, has, genetic, material, contained, in, the, cell, nucleus, the, nuclear, genome, and, in, the, mitochondria, the, mitochondrial, genome, in, humans, the, nuclear, genome, is, divided, into, 46, linear, dna, molecules, called, chromosomes, including, 22, homologous, chromosome, pairs, and, a, pair, of, sex, chromosomes, the, mitochondrial, genome, is, a, circular, dna, molecule, distinct, from, nuclear, dna, although, the, mitochondrial, dna, is, very, small, compared, to, nuclear, chromosomes, it, codes, for, 13, proteins, involved, in, mitochondrial, energy, production, and, specific, trnas, foreign, genetic, material, most, commonly, dna, can, also, be, artificially, introduced, into, the, cell, by, a, process, called, transfection, this, can, be, transient, if, the, dna, is, not, inserted, into, the, cell, s, genome, or, stable, if, it, is, certain, viruses, also, insert, their, genetic, material, into, the, genome, organelles, are, parts, of, the, cell, that, are, adapted, and, or, specialized, for, carrying, out, one, or, more, vital, functions, analogous, to, the, organs, of, the, human, body, such, as, the, heart, lung, and, kidney, with, each, organ, performing, a, different, function, both, eukaryotic, and, prokaryotic, cells, have, organelles, but, prokaryotic, organelles, are, generally, simpler, and, are, not, membrane, bound, there, are, several, types, of, organelles, in, a, cell, some, such, as, the, nucleus, and, golgi, apparatus, are, typically, solitary, while, others, such, as, mitochondria, chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and, lysosomes, can, be, numerous, hundreds, to, thousands, the, cytosol, is, the, gelatinous, fluid, that, fills, the, cell, and, surrounds, the, organelles, many, cells, also, have, structures, which, exist, wholly, or, partially, outside, the, cell, membrane, these, structures, are, notable, because, they, are, not, protected, from, the, external, environment, by, the, cell, membrane, in, order, to, assemble, these, structures, their, components, must, be, carried, across, the, cell, membrane, by, export, processes, many, types, of, prokaryotic, and, eukaryotic, cells, have, a, cell, wall, the, cell, wall, acts, to, protect, the, cell, mechanically, and, chemically, from, its, environment, and, is, an, additional, layer, of, protection, to, the, cell, membrane, different, types, of, cell, have, cell, walls, made, up, of, different, materials, plant, cell, walls, are, primarily, made, up, of, cellulose, fungi, cell, walls, are, made, up, of, chitin, and, bacteria, cell, walls, are, made, up, of, peptidoglycan, a, gelatinous, capsule, is, present, in, some, bacteria, outside, the, cell, membrane, and, cell, wall, the, capsule, may, be, polysaccharide, as, in, pneumococci, meningococci, or, polypeptide, as, bacillus, anthracis, or, hyaluronic, acid, as, in, streptococci, capsules, are, not, marked, by, normal, staining, protocols, and, can, be, detected, by, india, ink, or, methyl, blue, which, allows, for, higher, contrast, between, the, cells, for, observation, 87, flagella, are, organelles, for, cellular, mobility, the, bacterial, flagellum, stretches, from, cytoplasm, through, the, cell, membrane, s, and, extrudes, through, the, cell, wall, they, are, long, and, thick, thread, like, appendages, protein, in, nature, a, different, type, of, flagellum, is, found, in, archaea, and, a, different, type, is, found, in, eukaryotes, a, fimbria, plural, fimbriae, also, known, as, a, pilus, plural, pili, is, a, short, thin, hair, like, filament, found, on, the, surface, of, bacteria, fimbriae, are, formed, of, a, protein, called, pilin, antigenic, and, are, responsible, for, the, attachment, of, bacteria, to, specific, receptors, on, human, cells, cell, adhesion, there, are, special, types, of, pili, involved, in, bacterial, conjugation, cell, division, involves, a, single, cell, called, a, mother, cell, dividing, into, two, daughter, cells, this, leads, to, growth, in, multicellular, organisms, the, growth, of, tissue, and, to, procreation, vegetative, reproduction, in, unicellular, organisms, prokaryotic, cells, divide, by, binary, fission, while, eukaryotic, cells, usually, undergo, a, process, of, nuclear, division, called, mitosis, followed, by, division, of, the, cell, called, cytokinesis, a, diploid, cell, may, also, undergo, meiosis, to, produce, haploid, cells, usually, four, haploid, cells, serve, as, gametes, in, multicellular, organisms, fusing, to, form, new, diploid, cells, dna, replication, or, the, process, of, duplicating, a, cell, s, genome, always, happens, when, a, cell, divides, through, mitosis, or, binary, fission, this, occurs, during, the, s, phase, of, the, cell, cycle, in, meiosis, the, dna, is, replicated, only, once, while, the, cell, divides, twice, dna, replication, only, occurs, before, meiosis, i, dna, replication, does, not, occur, when, the, cells, divide, the, second, time, in, meiosis, ii, replication, like, all, cellular, activities, requires, specialized, proteins, for, carrying, out, the, job, cells, of, all, organisms, contain, enzyme, systems, that, scan, their, dna, for, damage, and, carry, out, repair, processes, when, it, is, detected, diverse, repair, processes, have, evolved, in, organisms, ranging, from, bacteria, to, humans, the, widespread, prevalence, of, these, repair, processes, indicates, the, importance, of, maintaining, cellular, dna, in, an, undamaged, state, in, order, to, avoid, cell, death, or, errors, of, replication, due, to, damage, that, could, lead, to, mutation, e, coli, bacteria, are, a, well, studied, example, of, a, cellular, organism, with, diverse, well, defined, dna, repair, processes, these, include, nucleotide, excision, repair, dna, mismatch, repair, non, homologous, end, joining, of, double, strand, breaks, recombinational, repair, and, light, dependent, repair, photoreactivation, between, successive, cell, divisions, cells, grow, through, the, functioning, of, cellular, metabolism, cell, metabolism, is, the, process, by, which, individual, cells, process, nutrient, molecules, metabolism, has, two, distinct, divisions, catabolism, in, which, the, cell, breaks, down, complex, molecules, to, produce, energy, and, reducing, power, and, anabolism, in, which, the, cell, uses, energy, and, reducing, power, to, construct, complex, molecules, and, perform, other, biological, functions, complex, sugars, can, be, broken, down, into, simpler, sugar, molecules, called, monosaccharides, such, as, glucose, once, inside, the, cell, glucose, is, broken, down, to, make, adenosine, triphosphate, atp, a, molecule, that, possesses, readily, available, energy, through, two, different, pathways, in, plant, cells, chloroplasts, create, sugars, by, photosynthesis, using, the, energy, of, light, to, join, molecules, of, water, and, carbon, dioxide, cells, are, capable, of, synthesizing, new, proteins, which, are, essential, for, the, modulation, and, maintenance, of, cellular, activities, this, process, involves, the, formation, of, new, protein, molecules, from, amino, acid, building, blocks, based, on, information, encoded, in, dna, rna, protein, synthesis, generally, consists, of, two, major, steps, transcription, and, translation, transcription, is, the, process, where, genetic, information, in, dna, is, used, to, produce, a, complementary, rna, strand, this, rna, strand, is, then, processed, to, give, messenger, rna, mrna, which, is, free, to, migrate, through, the, cell, mrna, molecules, bind, to, protein, rna, complexes, called, ribosomes, located, in, the, cytosol, where, they, are, translated, into, polypeptide, sequences, the, ribosome, mediates, the, formation, of, a, polypeptide, sequence, based, on, the, mrna, sequence, the, mrna, sequence, directly, relates, to, the, polypeptide, sequence, by, binding, to, transfer, rna, trna, adapter, molecules, in, binding, pockets, within, the, ribosome, the, new, polypeptide, then, folds, into, a, functional, three, dimensional, protein, molecule, unicellular, organisms, can, move, in, order, to, find, food, or, escape, predators, common, mechanisms, of, motion, include, flagella, and, cilia, in, multicellular, organisms, cells, can, move, during, processes, such, as, wound, healing, the, immune, response, and, cancer, metastasis, for, example, in, wound, healing, in, animals, white, blood, cells, move, to, the, wound, site, to, kill, the, microorganisms, that, cause, infection, cell, motility, involves, many, receptors, crosslinking, bundling, binding, adhesion, motor, and, other, proteins, the, process, is, divided, into, three, steps, protrusion, of, the, leading, edge, of, the, cell, adhesion, of, the, leading, edge, and, de, adhesion, at, the, cell, body, and, rear, and, cytoskeletal, contraction, to, pull, the, cell, forward, each, step, is, driven, by, physical, forces, generated, by, unique, segments, of, the, cytoskeleton, in, august, 2020, scientists, described, one, way, cells, in, particular, cells, of, a, slime, mold, and, mouse, pancreatic, cancer, derived, cells, are, able, to, navigate, efficiently, through, a, body, and, identify, the, best, routes, through, complex, mazes, generating, gradients, after, breaking, down, diffused, chemoattractants, which, enable, them, to, sense, upcoming, maze, junctions, before, reaching, them, including, around, corners, multicellular, organisms, are, organisms, that, consist, of, more, than, one, cell, in, contrast, to, single, celled, organisms, in, complex, multicellular, organisms, cells, specialize, into, different, cell, types, that, are, adapted, to, particular, functions, in, mammals, major, cell, types, include, skin, cells, muscle, cells, neurons, blood, cells, fibroblasts, stem, cells, and, others, cell, types, differ, both, in, appearance, and, function, yet, are, genetically, identical, cells, are, able, to, be, of, the, same, genotype, but, of, different, cell, type, due, to, the, differential, expression, of, the, genes, they, contain, most, distinct, cell, types, arise, from, a, single, totipotent, cell, called, a, zygote, that, differentiates, into, hundreds, of, different, cell, types, during, the, course, of, development, differentiation, of, cells, is, driven, by, different, environmental, cues, such, as, cell, cell, interaction, and, intrinsic, differences, such, as, those, caused, by, the, uneven, distribution, of, molecules, during, division, multicellularity, has, evolved, independently, at, least, 25, times, including, in, some, prokaryotes, like, cyanobacteria, myxobacteria, actinomycetes, or, methanosarcina, however, complex, multicellular, organisms, evolved, only, in, six, eukaryotic, groups, animals, fungi, brown, algae, red, algae, green, algae, and, plants, it, evolved, repeatedly, for, plants, chloroplastida, once, or, twice, for, animals, once, for, brown, algae, and, perhaps, several, times, for, fungi, slime, molds, and, red, algae, multicellularity, may, have, evolved, from, colonies, of, interdependent, organisms, from, cellularization, or, from, organisms, in, symbiotic, relationships, the, first, evidence, of, multicellularity, is, from, cyanobacteria, like, organisms, that, lived, between, 3, and, 3, 5, billion, years, ago, other, early, fossils, of, multicellular, organisms, include, the, contested, grypania, spiralis, and, the, fossils, of, the, black, shales, of, the, palaeoproterozoic, francevillian, group, fossil, b, formation, in, gabon, the, evolution, of, multicellularity, from, unicellular, ancestors, has, been, replicated, in, the, laboratory, in, evolution, experiments, using, predation, as, the, selective, pressure, the, origin, of, cells, has, to, do, with, the, origin, of, life, which, began, the, history, of, life, on, earth, small, molecules, needed, for, life, may, have, been, carried, to, earth, on, meteorites, created, at, deep, sea, vents, or, synthesized, by, lightning, in, a, reducing, atmosphere, there, is, little, experimental, data, defining, what, the, first, self, replicating, forms, were, rna, may, have, been, the, earliest, self, replicating, molecule, as, it, can, both, store, genetic, information, and, catalyze, chemical, reactions, cells, emerged, around, 4, billion, years, ago, the, first, cells, were, most, likely, heterotrophs, the, early, cell, membranes, were, probably, simpler, and, more, permeable, than, modern, ones, with, only, a, single, fatty, acid, chain, per, lipid, lipids, spontaneously, form, bilayered, vesicles, in, water, and, could, have, preceded, rna, eukaryotic, cells, were, created, some, 2, 2, billion, years, ago, in, a, process, called, eukaryogenesis, this, is, widely, agreed, to, have, involved, symbiogenesis, in, which, archaea, and, bacteria, came, together, to, create, the, first, eukaryotic, common, ancestor, this, cell, had, a, new, level, of, complexity, and, capability, with, a, nucleus, and, facultatively, aerobic, mitochondria, it, evolved, some, 2, billion, years, ago, into, a, population, of, single, celled, organisms, that, included, the, last, eukaryotic, common, ancestor, gaining, capabilities, along, the, way, though, the, sequence, of, the, steps, involved, has, been, disputed, and, may, not, have, started, with, symbiogenesis, it, featured, at, least, one, centriole, and, cilium, sex, meiosis, and, syngamy, peroxisomes, and, a, dormant, cyst, with, a, cell, wall, of, chitin, and, or, cellulose, in, turn, the, last, eukaryotic, common, ancestor, gave, rise, to, the, eukaryotes, crown, group, containing, the, ancestors, of, animals, fungi, plants, and, a, diverse, range, of, single, celled, organisms, the, plants, were, created, around, 1, 6, billion, years, ago, with, a, second, episode, of, symbiogenesis, that, added, chloroplasts, derived, from, cyanobacteria, in, 1665, robert, hooke, examined, a, thin, slice, of, cork, under, his, microscope, and, saw, a, structure, of, small, enclosures, he, wrote, i, could, exceeding, plainly, perceive, it, to, be, all, perforated, and, porous, much, like, a, honey, comb, but, that, the, pores, of, it, were, not, regular, to, further, support, his, theory, matthias, schleiden, and, theodor, schwann, both, also, studied, cells, of, both, animal, and, plants, what, they, discovered, were, significant, differences, between, the, two, types, of, cells, this, put, forth, the, idea, that, cells, were, not, only, fundamental, to, plants, but, animals, as, well
