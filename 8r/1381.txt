hypothermia, is, defined, as, a, body, core, temperature, below, 35, 0, c, 95, 0, f, in, humans, symptoms, depend, on, the, temperature, in, mild, hypothermia, there, is, shivering, and, mental, confusion, in, moderate, hypothermia, shivering, stops, and, confusion, increases, in, severe, hypothermia, there, may, be, hallucinations, and, paradoxical, undressing, in, which, a, person, removes, their, clothing, as, well, as, an, increased, risk, of, the, heart, stopping, hypothermia, has, two, main, types, of, causes, it, classically, occurs, from, exposure, to, cold, weather, and, cold, water, immersion, it, may, also, occur, from, any, condition, that, decreases, heat, production, or, increases, heat, loss, commonly, this, includes, alcohol, intoxication, but, may, also, include, low, blood, sugar, anorexia, and, advanced, age, body, temperature, is, usually, maintained, near, a, constant, level, of, 36, 5, 37, 5, c, 97, 7, 99, 5, f, through, thermoregulation, efforts, to, increase, body, temperature, involve, shivering, increased, voluntary, activity, and, putting, on, warmer, clothing, hypothermia, may, be, diagnosed, based, on, either, a, person, s, symptoms, in, the, presence, of, risk, factors, or, by, measuring, a, person, s, core, temperature, the, treatment, of, mild, hypothermia, involves, warm, drinks, warm, clothing, and, voluntary, physical, activity, in, those, with, moderate, hypothermia, heating, blankets, and, warmed, intravenous, fluids, are, recommended, people, with, moderate, or, severe, hypothermia, should, be, moved, gently, in, severe, hypothermia, extracorporeal, membrane, oxygenation, ecmo, or, cardiopulmonary, bypass, may, be, useful, in, those, without, a, pulse, cardiopulmonary, resuscitation, cpr, is, indicated, along, with, the, above, measures, rewarming, is, typically, continued, until, a, person, s, temperature, is, greater, than, 32, c, 90, f, if, there, is, no, improvement, at, this, point, or, the, blood, potassium, level, is, greater, than, 12, millimoles, per, litre, at, any, time, resuscitation, may, be, discontinued, hypothermia, is, the, cause, of, at, least, 1, 500, deaths, a, year, in, the, united, states, it, is, more, common, in, older, people, and, males, one, of, the, lowest, documented, body, temperatures, from, which, someone, with, accidental, hypothermia, has, survived, is, 12, 7, c, 54, 9, f, in, a, 2, year, old, boy, from, poland, named, adam, survival, after, more, than, six, hours, of, cpr, has, been, described, in, individuals, for, whom, ecmo, or, bypass, is, used, survival, is, around, 50, deaths, due, to, hypothermia, have, played, an, important, role, in, many, wars, the, term, is, from, greek, ypo, meaning, under, and, th, rm, meaning, heat, the, opposite, of, hypothermia, is, hyperthermia, an, increased, body, temperature, due, to, failed, thermoregulation, hypothermia, is, often, defined, as, any, body, temperature, below, 35, 0, c, 95, 0, f, with, this, method, it, is, divided, into, degrees, of, severity, based, on, the, core, temperature, another, classification, system, the, swiss, staging, system, divides, hypothermia, based, on, the, presenting, symptoms, which, is, preferred, when, it, is, not, possible, to, determine, an, accurate, core, temperature, other, cold, related, injuries, that, can, be, present, either, alone, or, in, combination, with, hypothermia, include, the, normal, human, body, temperature, is, often, stated, as, 36, 5, 37, 5, c, 97, 7, 99, 5, f, hyperthermia, and, fever, are, defined, as, a, temperature, of, greater, than, 37, 5, 38, 3, c, 99, 5, 100, 9, f, signs, and, symptoms, vary, depending, on, the, degree, of, hypothermia, and, may, be, divided, by, the, three, stages, of, severity, people, with, hypothermia, may, appear, pale, and, feel, cold, to, touch, infants, with, hypothermia, may, feel, cold, when, touched, with, bright, red, skin, and, an, unusual, lack, of, energy, behavioural, changes, such, as, impaired, judgement, impaired, sense, of, time, and, place, unusual, aggression, and, numbness, can, be, observed, in, individuals, with, hypothermia, they, can, also, deny, their, condition, and, refuse, any, help, a, hypothermic, person, can, be, euphoric, and, hallucinating, cold, stress, refers, to, a, near, normal, body, temperature, with, low, skin, temperature, signs, include, shivering, cold, stress, is, caused, by, cold, exposure, and, it, can, lead, to, hypothermia, and, frostbite, if, not, treated, symptoms, of, mild, hypothermia, may, be, vague, with, sympathetic, nervous, system, excitation, shivering, high, blood, pressure, fast, heart, rate, fast, respiratory, rate, and, contraction, of, blood, vessels, these, are, all, physiological, responses, to, preserve, heat, increased, urine, production, due, to, cold, mental, confusion, and, liver, dysfunction, may, also, be, present, hyperglycemia, may, be, present, as, glucose, consumption, by, cells, and, insulin, secretion, both, decrease, and, tissue, sensitivity, to, insulin, may, be, blunted, sympathetic, activation, also, releases, glucose, from, the, liver, in, many, cases, however, especially, in, people, with, alcoholic, intoxication, hypoglycemia, appears, to, be, a, more, common, cause, hypoglycemia, is, also, found, in, many, people, with, hypothermia, as, hypothermia, may, be, a, result, of, hypoglycemia, as, hypothermia, progresses, symptoms, include, mental, status, changes, such, as, amnesia, confusion, slurred, speech, decreased, reflexes, and, loss, of, fine, motor, skills, as, the, temperature, decreases, further, physiological, systems, falter, and, heart, rate, respiratory, rate, and, blood, pressure, all, decrease, this, results, in, an, expected, heart, rate, in, the, 30s, at, a, temperature, of, 28, c, 82, f, there, is, often, cold, inflamed, skin, hallucinations, lack, of, reflexes, fixed, dilated, pupils, low, blood, pressure, pulmonary, edema, and, shivering, is, often, absent, pulse, and, respiration, rates, decrease, significantly, but, fast, heart, rates, ventricular, tachycardia, atrial, fibrillation, can, also, occur, atrial, fibrillation, is, not, typically, a, concern, in, and, of, itself, twenty, to, fifty, percent, of, hypothermia, deaths, are, associated, with, paradoxical, undressing, this, typically, occurs, during, moderate, and, severe, hypothermia, as, the, person, becomes, disoriented, confused, and, combative, they, may, begin, discarding, their, clothing, which, in, turn, increases, the, rate, of, heat, loss, rescuers, who, are, trained, in, mountain, survival, techniques, are, taught, to, expect, this, however, people, who, die, from, hypothermia, in, urban, environments, who, are, found, in, an, undressed, state, are, sometimes, incorrectly, assumed, to, have, been, subjected, to, sexual, assault, one, explanation, for, the, effect, is, a, cold, induced, malfunction, of, the, hypothalamus, the, part, of, the, brain, that, regulates, body, temperature, another, explanation, is, that, the, muscles, contracting, peripheral, blood, vessels, become, exhausted, known, as, a, loss, of, vasomotor, tone, and, relax, leading, to, a, sudden, surge, of, blood, and, heat, to, the, extremities, causing, the, person, to, feel, overheated, an, apparent, self, protective, behaviour, known, as, terminal, burrowing, or, hide, and, die, syndrome, occurs, in, the, final, stages, of, hypothermia, those, affected, will, enter, small, enclosed, spaces, such, as, underneath, beds, or, behind, wardrobes, it, is, often, associated, with, paradoxical, undressing, researchers, in, germany, claim, this, is, obviously, an, autonomous, process, of, the, brain, stem, which, is, triggered, in, the, final, state, of, hypothermia, and, produces, a, primitive, and, burrowing, like, behavior, of, protection, as, seen, in, hibernating, mammals, this, happens, mostly, in, cases, where, temperature, drops, slowly, hypothermia, usually, occurs, from, exposure, to, low, temperatures, and, is, frequently, complicated, by, alcohol, consumption, any, condition, that, decreases, heat, production, increases, heat, loss, or, impairs, thermoregulation, however, may, contribute, thus, hypothermia, risk, factors, include, substance, use, disorders, including, alcohol, use, disorder, homelessness, any, condition, that, affects, judgment, such, as, hypoglycemia, the, extremes, of, age, poor, clothing, chronic, medical, conditions, such, as, hypothyroidism, and, sepsis, and, living, in, a, cold, environment, hypothermia, occurs, frequently, in, major, trauma, and, is, also, observed, in, severe, cases, of, anorexia, nervosa, hypothermia, is, also, associated, with, worse, outcomes, in, people, with, sepsis, while, most, people, with, sepsis, develop, fevers, elevated, body, temperature, some, develop, hypothermia, in, urban, areas, hypothermia, frequently, occurs, with, chronic, cold, exposure, such, as, in, cases, of, homelessness, as, well, as, with, immersion, accidents, involving, drugs, alcohol, or, mental, illness, while, studies, have, shown, that, people, experiencing, homelessness, are, at, risk, of, premature, death, from, hypothermia, the, true, incidence, of, hypothermia, related, deaths, in, this, population, is, difficult, to, determine, in, more, rural, environments, the, incidence, of, hypothermia, is, higher, among, people, with, significant, comorbidities, and, less, ability, to, move, independently, with, rising, interest, in, wilderness, exploration, and, outdoor, and, water, sports, the, incidence, of, hypothermia, secondary, to, accidental, exposure, may, become, more, frequent, in, the, general, population, alcohol, consumption, increases, the, risk, of, hypothermia, in, two, ways, vasodilation, and, temperature, controlling, systems, in, the, brain, vasodilation, increases, blood, flow, to, the, skin, resulting, in, heat, being, lost, to, the, environment, this, produces, the, effect, of, feeling, warm, when, one, is, actually, losing, heat, alcohol, also, affects, the, temperature, regulating, system, in, the, brain, decreasing, the, body, s, ability, to, shiver, and, use, energy, that, would, normally, aid, the, body, in, generating, heat, the, overall, effects, of, alcohol, lead, to, a, decrease, in, body, temperature, and, a, decreased, ability, to, generate, body, heat, in, response, to, cold, environments, alcohol, is, a, common, risk, factor, for, death, due, to, hypothermia, between, 33, and, 73, of, hypothermia, cases, are, complicated, by, alcohol, hypothermia, continues, to, be, a, major, limitation, to, swimming, or, diving, in, cold, water, the, reduction, in, finger, dexterity, due, to, pain, or, numbness, decreases, general, safety, and, work, capacity, which, consequently, increases, the, risk, of, other, injuries, other, factors, predisposing, to, immersion, hypothermia, include, dehydration, inadequate, rewarming, between, repetitive, dives, starting, a, dive, while, wearing, cold, wet, dry, suit, undergarments, sweating, with, work, inadequate, thermal, insulation, and, poor, physical, conditioning, heat, is, lost, much, more, quickly, in, water, than, in, air, thus, water, temperatures, that, would, be, quite, reasonable, as, outdoor, air, temperatures, can, lead, to, hypothermia, in, survivors, although, this, is, not, usually, the, direct, clinical, cause, of, death, for, those, who, are, not, rescued, a, water, temperature, of, 10, c, 50, f, can, lead, to, death, in, as, little, as, one, hour, and, water, temperatures, near, freezing, can, cause, death, in, as, little, as, 15, minutes, during, the, sinking, of, the, titanic, most, people, who, entered, the, 2, c, 28, f, water, died, in, 15, 30, minutes, the, actual, cause, of, death, in, cold, water, is, usually, the, bodily, reactions, to, heat, loss, and, to, freezing, water, rather, than, hypothermia, loss, of, core, temperature, itself, for, example, plunged, into, freezing, seas, around, 20, of, victims, die, within, two, minutes, from, cold, shock, uncontrolled, rapid, breathing, and, gasping, causing, water, inhalation, massive, increase, in, blood, pressure, and, cardiac, strain, leading, to, cardiac, arrest, and, panic, another, 50, die, within, 15, 30, minutes, from, cold, incapacitation, inability, to, use, or, control, limbs, and, hands, for, swimming, or, gripping, as, the, body, protectively, shuts, down, the, peripheral, muscles, of, the, limbs, to, protect, its, core, exhaustion, and, unconsciousness, cause, drowning, claiming, the, rest, within, a, similar, time, heat, is, primarily, generated, in, muscle, tissue, including, the, heart, and, in, the, liver, while, it, is, lost, through, the, skin, 90, and, lungs, 10, heat, production, may, be, increased, two, to, four, fold, through, muscle, contractions, i, e, exercise, and, shivering, the, rate, of, heat, loss, is, determined, as, with, any, object, by, convection, conduction, and, radiation, the, rates, of, these, can, be, affected, by, body, mass, index, body, surface, area, to, volume, ratios, clothing, and, other, environmental, conditions, many, changes, to, physiology, occur, as, body, temperatures, decrease, these, occur, in, the, cardiovascular, system, leading, to, the, osborn, j, wave, and, other, dysrhythmias, decreased, central, nervous, system, electrical, activity, cold, diuresis, and, non, cardiogenic, pulmonary, edema, research, has, shown, that, glomerular, filtration, rates, gfr, decrease, as, a, result, of, hypothermia, in, essence, hypothermia, increases, preglomerular, vasoconstriction, thus, decreasing, both, renal, blood, flow, rbf, and, gfr, accurate, determination, of, core, temperature, often, requires, a, special, low, temperature, thermometer, as, most, clinical, thermometers, do, not, measure, accurately, below, 34, 4, c, 93, 9, f, a, low, temperature, thermometer, can, be, placed, in, the, rectum, esophagus, or, bladder, esophageal, measurements, are, the, most, accurate, and, are, recommended, once, a, person, is, intubated, other, methods, of, measurement, such, as, in, the, mouth, under, the, arm, or, using, an, infrared, ear, thermometer, are, often, not, accurate, as, a, hypothermic, person, s, heart, rate, may, be, very, slow, prolonged, feeling, for, a, pulse, could, be, required, before, detecting, in, 2005, the, american, heart, association, recommended, at, least, 30, 45, seconds, to, verify, the, absence, of, a, pulse, before, initiating, cpr, others, recommend, a, 60, second, check, the, classical, ecg, finding, of, hypothermia, is, the, osborn, j, wave, also, ventricular, fibrillation, frequently, occurs, below, 28, c, 82, f, and, asystole, below, 20, c, 68, f, the, osborn, j, may, look, very, similar, to, those, of, an, acute, st, elevation, myocardial, infarction, thrombolysis, as, a, reaction, to, the, presence, of, osborn, j, waves, is, not, indicated, as, it, would, only, worsen, the, underlying, coagulopathy, caused, by, hypothermia, staying, dry, and, wearing, proper, clothing, help, to, prevent, hypothermia, synthetic, and, wool, fabrics, are, superior, to, cotton, as, they, provide, better, insulation, when, wet, and, dry, some, synthetic, fabrics, such, as, polypropylene, and, polyester, are, used, in, clothing, designed, to, wick, perspiration, away, from, the, body, such, as, liner, socks, and, moisture, wicking, undergarments, clothing, should, be, loose, fitting, as, tight, clothing, reduces, the, circulation, of, warm, blood, in, planning, outdoor, activity, prepare, appropriately, for, possible, cold, weather, those, who, drink, alcohol, before, or, during, outdoor, activity, should, ensure, at, least, one, sober, person, responsible, for, safety, is, present, covering, the, head, is, effective, but, no, more, effective, than, covering, any, other, part, of, the, body, while, common, folklore, says, that, people, lose, most, of, their, heat, through, their, heads, heat, loss, from, the, head, is, no, more, significant, than, that, from, other, uncovered, parts, of, the, body, however, heat, loss, from, the, head, is, significant, in, infants, whose, head, is, larger, relative, to, the, rest, of, the, body, than, in, adults, several, studies, have, shown, that, for, uncovered, infants, lined, hats, significantly, reduce, heat, loss, and, thermal, stress, children, have, a, larger, surface, area, per, unit, mass, and, other, things, being, equal, should, have, one, more, layer, of, clothing, than, adults, in, similar, conditions, and, the, time, they, spend, in, cold, environments, should, be, limited, however, children, are, often, more, active, than, adults, and, may, generate, more, heat, in, both, adults, and, children, overexertion, causes, sweating, and, thus, increases, heat, loss, building, a, shelter, can, aid, survival, where, there, is, danger, of, death, from, exposure, shelters, can, be, constructed, out, of, a, variety, of, materials, metal, can, conduct, heat, away, from, the, occupants, and, is, sometimes, best, avoided, the, shelter, should, not, be, too, big, so, body, warmth, stays, near, the, occupants, good, ventilation, is, essential, especially, if, a, fire, will, be, lit, in, the, shelter, fires, should, be, put, out, before, the, occupants, sleep, to, prevent, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, people, caught, in, very, cold, snowy, conditions, can, build, an, igloo, or, snow, cave, to, shelter, the, united, states, coast, guard, promotes, using, life, vests, to, protect, against, hypothermia, through, the, 50, 50, 50, rule, if, someone, is, in, 10, c, 50, f, water, for, 50, minutes, they, have, a, 50, percent, better, chance, of, survival, if, they, are, wearing, a, life, jacket, a, heat, escape, lessening, position, can, be, used, to, increase, survival, in, cold, water, babies, should, sleep, at, 16, 20, c, 61, 68, f, and, housebound, people, should, be, checked, regularly, to, make, sure, the, temperature, of, the, home, is, at, least, 18, c, 64, f, aggressiveness, of, treatment, is, matched, to, the, degree, of, hypothermia, treatment, ranges, from, noninvasive, passive, external, warming, to, active, external, rewarming, to, active, core, rewarming, in, severe, cases, resuscitation, begins, with, simultaneous, removal, from, the, cold, environment, and, management, of, the, airway, breathing, and, circulation, rapid, rewarming, is, then, commenced, moving, the, person, as, little, and, as, gently, as, possible, is, recommended, as, aggressive, handling, may, increase, risks, of, a, dysrhythmia, hypoglycemia, is, a, frequent, complication, and, needs, to, be, tested, for, and, treated, intravenous, thiamine, and, glucose, is, often, recommended, as, many, causes, of, hypothermia, are, complicated, by, wernicke, s, encephalopathy, the, uk, national, health, service, advises, against, putting, a, person, in, a, hot, bath, massaging, their, arms, and, legs, using, a, heating, pad, or, giving, them, alcohol, these, measures, can, cause, a, rapid, fall, in, blood, pressure, and, potential, cardiac, arrest, rewarming, can, be, done, with, a, number, of, methods, including, passive, external, rewarming, active, external, rewarming, and, active, internal, rewarming, passive, external, rewarming, involves, the, use, of, a, person, s, own, ability, to, generate, heat, by, providing, properly, insulated, dry, clothing, and, moving, to, a, warm, environment, passive, external, rewarming, is, recommended, for, those, with, mild, hypothermia, active, external, rewarming, involves, applying, warming, devices, externally, such, as, a, heating, blanket, these, may, function, by, warmed, forced, air, bair, hugger, is, a, commonly, used, device, chemical, reactions, or, electricity, in, wilderness, environments, hypothermia, may, be, helped, by, placing, hot, water, bottles, in, both, armpits, and, in, the, groin, active, external, rewarming, is, recommended, for, moderate, hypothermia, active, core, rewarming, involves, the, use, of, intravenous, warmed, fluids, irrigation, of, body, cavities, with, warmed, fluids, the, chest, or, abdomen, use, of, warm, humidified, inhaled, air, or, use, of, extracorporeal, rewarming, such, as, via, a, heart, lung, machine, or, extracorporeal, membrane, oxygenation, ecmo, extracorporeal, rewarming, is, the, fastest, method, for, those, with, severe, hypothermia, when, severe, hypothermia, has, led, to, cardiac, arrest, effective, extracorporeal, warming, results, in, survival, with, normal, mental, function, about, 50, of, the, time, chest, irrigation, is, recommended, if, bypass, or, ecmo, is, not, possible, rewarming, shock, or, rewarming, collapse, is, a, sudden, drop, in, blood, pressure, in, combination, with, a, low, cardiac, output, which, may, occur, during, active, treatment, of, a, severely, hypothermic, person, there, was, a, theoretical, concern, that, external, rewarming, rather, than, internal, rewarming, may, increase, the, risk, these, concerns, were, partly, believed, to, be, due, to, afterdrop, a, situation, detected, during, laboratory, experiments, where, there, is, a, continued, decrease, in, core, temperature, after, rewarming, has, been, started, recent, studies, have, not, supported, these, concerns, and, problems, are, not, found, with, active, external, rewarming, for, people, who, are, alert, and, able, to, swallow, drinking, warm, not, hot, sweetened, liquids, can, help, raise, the, temperature, general, medical, consensus, advises, against, alcohol, and, caffeinated, drinks, as, most, hypothermic, people, are, moderately, dehydrated, due, to, cold, induced, diuresis, warmed, intravenous, fluids, to, a, temperature, of, 38, 45, c, 100, 113, f, are, often, recommended, in, those, without, signs, of, life, cardiopulmonary, resuscitation, cpr, should, be, continued, during, active, rewarming, for, ventricular, fibrillation, or, ventricular, tachycardia, a, single, defibrillation, should, be, attempted, however, people, with, severe, hypothermia, may, not, respond, to, pacing, or, defibrillation, it, is, not, known, if, further, defibrillation, should, be, withheld, until, the, core, temperature, reaches, 30, c, 86, f, in, europe, epinephrine, is, not, recommended, until, the, person, s, core, temperature, reaches, 30, c, 86, f, while, the, american, heart, association, recommends, up, to, three, doses, of, epinephrine, before, a, core, temperature, of, 30, c, 86, f, is, reached, once, a, temperature, of, 30, c, 86, f, has, been, reached, normal, acls, protocols, should, be, followed, it, is, usually, recommended, not, to, declare, a, person, dead, until, their, body, is, warmed, to, a, near, normal, body, temperature, of, greater, than, 32, c, 90, f, since, extreme, hypothermia, can, suppress, heart, and, brain, function, this, is, summarized, in, the, common, saying, you, re, not, dead, until, you, re, warm, and, dead, exceptions, include, if, there, are, obvious, fatal, injuries, or, the, chest, is, frozen, so, that, it, cannot, be, compressed, if, a, person, was, buried, in, an, avalanche, for, more, than, 35, minutes, and, is, found, with, a, mouth, packed, full, of, snow, without, a, pulse, stopping, early, may, also, be, reasonable, this, is, also, the, case, if, a, person, s, blood, potassium, is, greater, than, 12, mmol, l, those, who, are, stiff, with, pupils, that, do, not, move, may, survive, if, treated, aggressively, survival, with, good, function, also, occasionally, occurs, even, after, the, need, for, hours, of, cpr, children, who, have, near, drowning, accidents, in, water, near, 0, c, 32, f, can, occasionally, be, revived, even, over, an, hour, after, losing, consciousness, the, cold, water, lowers, the, metabolism, allowing, the, brain, to, withstand, a, much, longer, period, of, hypoxia, while, survival, is, possible, mortality, from, severe, or, profound, hypothermia, remains, high, despite, optimal, treatment, studies, estimate, mortality, at, between, 38, and, 75, in, those, who, have, hypothermia, due, to, another, underlying, health, problem, when, death, occurs, it, is, frequently, from, that, underlying, health, problem, between, 1995, and, 2004, in, the, united, states, an, average, of, 1, 560, cold, related, emergency, department, visits, occurred, per, year, and, in, the, years, 1999, to, 2004, an, average, of, 647, people, died, per, year, due, to, hypothermia, of, deaths, reported, between, 1999, and, 2002, in, the, us, 49, of, those, affected, were, 65, years, or, older, and, two, thirds, were, male, most, deaths, were, not, work, related, 63, and, 23, of, affected, people, were, at, home, hypothermia, was, most, common, during, the, autumn, and, winter, months, of, october, through, march, in, the, united, kingdom, an, estimated, 300, deaths, per, year, are, due, to, hypothermia, whereas, the, annual, incidence, of, hypothermia, related, deaths, in, canada, is, 8, 000, hypothermia, has, played, a, major, role, in, the, success, or, failure, of, many, military, campaigns, from, hannibal, s, loss, of, nearly, half, his, men, in, the, second, punic, war, 218, b, c, to, the, near, destruction, of, napoleon, s, armies, in, russia, in, 1812, men, wandered, around, confused, by, hypothermia, some, lost, consciousness, and, died, others, shivered, later, developed, torpor, and, tended, to, sleep, others, too, weak, to, walk, fell, on, their, knees, some, stayed, that, way, for, some, time, resisting, death, the, pulse, of, some, was, weak, and, hard, to, detect, others, groaned, yet, others, had, eyes, open, and, wild, with, quiet, delirium, deaths, from, hypothermia, in, russian, regions, continued, through, the, first, and, second, world, wars, especially, in, the, battle, of, stalingrad, civilian, examples, of, deaths, caused, by, hypothermia, occurred, during, the, sinkings, of, the, rms, titanic, and, rms, lusitania, and, more, recently, of, the, ms, estonia, antarctic, explorers, developed, hypothermia, ernest, shackleton, and, his, team, measured, body, temperatures, below, 94, 2, which, spells,

confused, through, hypothermia, nazi, human, experimentation, during, world, war, ii, amounting, to, medical, torture, included, hypothermia, experiments, which, killed, many, victims, there, were, 360, to, 400, experiments, and, 280, to, 300, subjects, indicating, some, had, more, than, one, experiment, performed, on, them, various, methods, of, rewarming, were, attempted, one, assistant, later, testified, that, some, victims, were, thrown, into, boiling, water, for, rewarming, various, degrees, of, hypothermia, may, be, deliberately, induced, in, medicine, for, purposes, of, treatment, of, brain, injury, or, lowering, metabolism, so, that, total, brain, ischemia, can, be, tolerated, for, a, short, time, deep, hypothermic, circulatory, arrest, is, a, medical, technique, in, which, the, brain, is, cooled, as, low, as, 10, c, which, allows, the, heart, to, be, stopped, and, blood, pressure, to, be, lowered, to, zero, for, the, treatment, of, aneurysms, and, other, circulatory, problems, that, do, not, tolerate, arterial, pressure, or, blood, flow, the, time, limit, for, this, technique, as, also, for, accidental, arrest, in, ice, water, which, internal, temperatures, may, drop, to, as, low, as, 15, c, is, about, one, hour, hypothermia, can, happen, in, most, mammals, in, cold, weather, and, can, be, fatal, baby, mammals, such, as, kittens, are, unable, to, regulate, their, body, temperatures, and, have, a, risk, of, hypothermia, if, they, are, not, kept, warm, by, their, mothers, many, animals, other, than, humans, often, induce, hypothermia, during, hibernation, or, torpor, water, bears, tardigrade, microscopic, multicellular, organisms, can, survive, freezing, at, low, temperatures, by, replacing, most, of, their, internal, water, with, the, sugar, trehalose, preventing, the, crystallization, that, otherwise, damages, cell, membranes
