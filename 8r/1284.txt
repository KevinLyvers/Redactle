dentistry, also, known, as, dental, medicine, and, oral, medicine, is, the, branch, of, medicine, focused, on, the, teeth, gums, and, mouth, it, consists, of, the, study, diagnosis, prevention, management, and, treatment, of, diseases, disorders, and, conditions, of, the, mouth, most, commonly, focused, on, dentition, the, development, and, arrangement, of, teeth, as, well, as, the, oral, mucosa, dentistry, may, also, encompass, other, aspects, of, the, craniofacial, complex, including, the, temporomandibular, joint, the, practitioner, is, called, a, dentist, the, history, of, dentistry, is, almost, as, ancient, as, the, history, of, humanity, and, civilization, with, the, earliest, evidence, dating, from, 7000, bc, to, 5500, bc, dentistry, is, thought, to, have, been, the, first, specialization, in, medicine, which, has, gone, on, to, develop, its, own, accredited, degree, with, its, own, specializations, dentistry, is, often, also, understood, to, subsume, the, now, largely, defunct, medical, specialty, of, stomatology, the, study, of, the, mouth, and, its, disorders, and, diseases, for, which, reason, the, two, terms, are, used, interchangeably, in, certain, regions, however, some, specialties, such, as, oral, and, maxillofacial, surgery, facial, reconstruction, may, require, both, medical, and, dental, degrees, to, accomplish, in, european, history, dentistry, is, considered, to, have, stemmed, from, the, trade, of, barber, surgeons, dental, treatments, are, carried, out, by, a, dental, team, which, often, consists, of, a, dentist, and, dental, auxiliaries, such, as, dental, assistants, dental, hygienists, dental, technicians, and, dental, therapists, most, dentists, either, work, in, private, practices, primary, care, dental, hospitals, or, secondary, care, institutions, prisons, armed, forces, bases, etc, the, modern, movement, of, evidence, based, dentistry, calls, for, the, use, of, high, quality, scientific, research, and, evidence, to, guide, decision, making, such, as, in, manual, tooth, conservation, use, of, fluoride, water, treatment, and, fluoride, toothpaste, dealing, with, oral, diseases, such, as, tooth, decay, and, periodontitis, as, well, as, systematic, diseases, such, as, osteoporosis, diabetes, celiac, disease, cancer, and, hiv, aids, which, could, also, affect, the, oral, cavity, other, practices, relevant, to, evidence, based, dentistry, include, radiology, of, the, mouth, to, inspect, teeth, deformity, or, oral, malaises, haematology, study, of, blood, to, avoid, bleeding, complications, during, dental, surgery, cardiology, due, to, various, severe, complications, arising, from, dental, surgery, with, patients, with, heart, disease, etc, the, term, dentistry, comes, from, dentist, which, comes, from, french, dentiste, which, comes, from, the, french, and, latin, words, for, tooth, the, term, for, the, associated, scientific, study, of, teeth, is, odontology, from, ancient, greek, romanized, odo, s, lit, tooth, the, study, of, the, structure, development, and, abnormalities, of, the, teeth, dentistry, usually, encompasses, practices, related, to, the, oral, cavity, according, to, the, world, health, organization, oral, diseases, are, major, public, health, problems, due, to, their, high, incidence, and, prevalence, across, the, globe, with, the, disadvantaged, affected, more, than, other, socio, economic, groups, the, majority, of, dental, treatments, are, carried, out, to, prevent, or, treat, the, two, most, common, oral, diseases, which, are, dental, caries, tooth, decay, and, periodontal, disease, gum, disease, or, pyorrhea, common, treatments, involve, the, restoration, of, teeth, extraction, or, surgical, removal, of, teeth, scaling, and, root, planing, endodontic, root, canal, treatment, and, cosmetic, dentistry, by, nature, of, their, general, training, dentists, without, specialization, can, carry, out, the, majority, of, dental, treatments, such, as, restorative, fillings, crowns, bridges, prosthetic, dentures, endodontic, root, canal, therapy, periodontal, gum, therapy, and, extraction, of, teeth, as, well, as, performing, examinations, radiographs, x, rays, and, diagnosis, dentists, can, also, prescribe, medications, used, in, the, field, such, as, antibiotics, sedatives, and, any, other, drugs, used, in, patient, management, depending, on, their, licensing, boards, general, dentists, may, be, required, to, complete, additional, training, to, perform, sedation, dental, implants, etc, dentists, also, encourage, the, prevention, of, oral, diseases, through, proper, hygiene, and, regular, twice, or, more, yearly, checkups, for, professional, cleaning, and, evaluation, oral, infections, and, inflammations, may, affect, overall, health, and, conditions, in, the, oral, cavity, may, be, indicative, of, systemic, diseases, such, as, osteoporosis, diabetes, celiac, disease, or, cancer, many, studies, have, also, shown, that, gum, disease, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, diabetes, heart, disease, and, preterm, birth, the, concept, that, oral, health, can, affect, systemic, health, and, disease, is, referred, to, as, oral, systemic, health, john, m, harris, started, the, world, s, first, dental, school, in, bainbridge, ohio, and, helped, to, establish, dentistry, as, a, health, profession, it, opened, on, 21, february, 1828, and, today, is, a, dental, museum, the, first, dental, college, baltimore, college, of, dental, surgery, opened, in, baltimore, maryland, us, in, 1840, the, second, in, the, united, states, was, the, ohio, college, of, dental, surgery, established, in, cincinnati, ohio, in, 1845, the, philadelphia, college, of, dental, surgery, followed, in, 1852, in, 1907, temple, university, accepted, a, bid, to, incorporate, the, school, studies, show, that, dentists, that, graduated, from, different, countries, or, even, from, different, dental, schools, in, one, country, may, make, different, clinical, decisions, for, the, same, clinical, condition, for, example, dentists, that, graduated, from, israeli, dental, schools, may, recommend, the, removal, of, asymptomatic, impacted, third, molar, wisdom, teeth, more, often, than, dentists, that, graduated, from, latin, american, or, eastern, european, dental, schools, in, the, united, kingdom, the, first, dental, schools, the, london, school, of, dental, surgery, and, the, metropolitan, school, of, dental, science, both, in, london, opened, in, 1859, the, british, dentists, act, of, 1878, and, the, 1879, dentists, register, limited, the, title, of, dentist, and, dental, surgeon, to, qualified, and, registered, practitioners, however, others, could, legally, describe, themselves, as, dental, experts, or, dental, consultants, the, practice, of, dentistry, in, the, united, kingdom, became, fully, regulated, with, the, 1921, dentists, act, which, required, the, registration, of, anyone, practising, dentistry, the, british, dental, association, formed, in, 1880, with, sir, john, tomes, as, president, played, a, major, role, in, prosecuting, dentists, practising, illegally, dentists, in, the, united, kingdom, are, now, regulated, by, the, general, dental, council, in, many, countries, dentists, usually, complete, between, five, and, eight, years, of, post, secondary, education, before, practising, though, not, mandatory, many, dentists, choose, to, complete, an, internship, or, residency, focusing, on, specific, aspects, of, dental, care, after, they, have, received, their, dental, degree, in, a, few, countries, to, become, a, qualified, dentist, one, must, usually, complete, at, least, four, years, of, postgraduate, study, dental, degrees, awarded, around, the, world, include, the, doctor, of, dental, surgery, dds, and, doctor, of, dental, medicine, dmd, in, north, america, us, and, canada, and, the, bachelor, of, dental, surgery, baccalaureus, dentalis, chirurgiae, bds, bdent, bchd, bdsc, in, the, uk, and, current, and, former, british, commonwealth, countries, all, dentists, in, the, united, states, undergo, at, least, three, years, of, undergraduate, studies, but, nearly, all, complete, a, bachelor, s, degree, this, schooling, is, followed, by, four, years, of, dental, school, to, qualify, as, a, doctor, of, dental, surgery, dds, or, doctor, of, dental, medicine, dmd, specialization, in, dentistry, is, available, in, the, fields, of, anesthesiology, dental, public, health, endodontics, oral, radiology, oral, and, maxillofacial, surgery, oral, medicine, orofacial, pain, pathology, orthodontics, pediatric, dentistry, pedodontics, periodontics, and, prosthodontics, some, dentists, undertake, further, training, after, their, initial, degree, in, order, to, specialize, exactly, which, subjects, are, recognized, by, dental, registration, bodies, varies, according, to, location, examples, include, tooth, decay, was, low, in, pre, agricultural, societies, but, the, advent, of, farming, society, about, 10, 000, years, ago, correlated, with, an, increase, in, tooth, decay, cavities, an, infected, tooth, from, italy, partially, cleaned, with, flint, tools, between, 13, 820, and, 14, 160, years, old, represents, the, oldest, known, dentistry, although, a, 2017, study, suggests, that, 130, 000, years, ago, the, neanderthals, already, used, rudimentary, dentistry, tools, the, indus, valley, has, yielded, evidence, of, dentistry, being, practised, as, far, back, as, 7000, bc, during, the, stone, age, the, neolithic, site, of, mehrgarh, now, in, pakistan, s, south, western, province, of, balochistan, indicates, that, this, form, of, dentistry, involved, curing, tooth, related, disorders, with, bow, drills, operated, perhaps, by, skilled, bead, crafters, the, reconstruction, of, this, ancient, form, of, dentistry, showed, that, the, methods, used, were, reliable, and, effective, the, earliest, dental, filling, made, of, beeswax, was, discovered, in, slovenia, and, dates, from, 6500, years, ago, dentistry, was, practised, in, prehistoric, malta, as, evidenced, by, a, skull, which, had, a, dental, abscess, lanced, from, the, root, of, a, tooth, dating, back, to, around, 2500, bc, an, ancient, sumerian, text, describes, a, tooth, worm, as, the, cause, of, dental, caries, evidence, of, this, belief, has, also, been, found, in, ancient, india, egypt, japan, and, china, the, legend, of, the, worm, is, also, found, in, the, homeric, hymns, and, as, late, as, the, 14th, century, ad, the, surgeon, guy, de, chauliac, still, promoted, the, belief, that, worms, cause, tooth, decay, recipes, for, the, treatment, of, toothache, infections, and, loose, teeth, are, spread, throughout, the, ebers, papyrus, kahun, papyri, brugsch, papyrus, and, hearst, papyrus, of, ancient, egypt, the, edwin, smith, papyrus, written, in, the, 17th, century, bc, but, which, may, reflect, previous, manuscripts, from, as, early, as, 3000, bc, discusses, the, treatment, of, dislocated, or, fractured, jaws, in, the, 18th, century, bc, the, code, of, hammurabi, referenced, dental, extraction, twice, as, it, related, to, punishment, examination, of, the, remains, of, some, ancient, egyptians, and, greco, romans, reveals, early, attempts, at, dental, prosthetics, however, it, is, possible, the, prosthetics, were, prepared, after, death, for, aesthetic, reasons, ancient, greek, scholars, hippocrates, and, aristotle, wrote, about, dentistry, including, the, eruption, pattern, of, teeth, treating, decayed, teeth, and, gum, disease, extracting, teeth, with, forceps, and, using, wires, to, stabilize, loose, teeth, and, fractured, jaws, some, say, the, first, use, of, dental, appliances, or, bridges, comes, from, the, etruscans, from, as, early, as, 700, bc, the, phoenicians, crafted, the, oldest, documented, dentures, during, the, 6th, 4th, century, bc, fashioning, them, from, gold, wire, and, incorporating, two, ivory, teeth, in, ancient, egypt, hesy, ra, is, the, first, named, dentist, greatest, of, the, teeth, the, egyptians, bound, replacement, teeth, together, with, gold, wire, roman, medical, writer, cornelius, celsus, wrote, extensively, of, oral, diseases, as, well, as, dental, treatments, such, as, narcotic, containing, emollients, and, astringents, the, earliest, dental, amalgams, were, first, documented, in, a, tang, dynasty, medical, text, written, by, the, chinese, physician, su, kung, in, 659, and, appeared, in, germany, in, 1528, during, the, islamic, golden, age, dentistry, was, discussed, in, several, famous, books, of, medicine, such, as, the, canon, in, medicine, written, by, avicenna, and, al, tasreef, by, al, zahrawi, who, is, considered, the, greatest, surgeon, of, the, middle, ages, avicenna, said, that, jaw, fracture, should, be, reduced, according, to, the, occlusal, guidance, of, the, teeth, this, principle, is, still, valid, in, modern, times, al, zahrawi, invented, over, 200, surgical, tools, that, resemble, the, modern, kind, historically, dental, extractions, have, been, used, to, treat, a, variety, of, illnesses, during, the, middle, ages, and, throughout, the, 19th, century, dentistry, was, not, a, profession, in, itself, and, often, dental, procedures, were, performed, by, barbers, or, general, physicians, barbers, usually, limited, their, practice, to, extracting, teeth, which, alleviated, pain, and, associated, chronic, tooth, infection, instruments, used, for, dental, extractions, date, back, several, centuries, in, the, 14th, century, guy, de, chauliac, most, probably, invented, the, dental, pelican, resembling, a, pelican, s, beak, which, was, used, to, perform, dental, extractions, up, until, the, late, 18th, century, the, pelican, was, replaced, by, the, dental, key, which, in, turn, was, replaced, by, modern, forceps, in, the, 19th, century, the, first, book, focused, solely, on, dentistry, was, the, artzney, buchlein, in, 1530, and, the, first, dental, textbook, written, in, english, was, called, operator, for, the, teeth, by, charles, allen, in, 1685, in, the, united, kingdom, there, was, no, formal, qualification, for, the, providers, of, dental, treatment, until, 1859, and, it, was, only, in, 1921, that, the, practice, of, dentistry, was, limited, to, those, who, were, professionally, qualified, the, royal, commission, on, the, national, health, service, in, 1979, reported, that, there, were, then, more, than, twice, as, many, registered, dentists, per, 10, 000, population, in, the, uk, than, there, were, in, 1921, it, was, between, 1650, and, 1800, that, the, science, of, modern, dentistry, developed, the, english, physician, thomas, browne, in, his, a, letter, to, a, friend, c, 1656, pub, 1690, made, an, early, dental, observation, with, characteristic, humour, the, egyptian, mummies, that, i, have, seen, have, had, their, mouths, open, and, somewhat, gaping, which, affordeth, a, good, opportunity, to, view, and, observe, their, teeth, wherein, tis, not, easie, to, find, any, wanting, or, decayed, and, therefore, in, egypt, where, one, man, practised, but, one, operation, or, the, diseases, but, of, single, parts, it, must, needs, be, a, barren, profession, to, confine, unto, that, of, drawing, of, teeth, and, little, better, than, to, have, been, tooth, drawer, unto, king, pyrrhus, who, had, but, two, in, his, head, the, french, surgeon, pierre, fauchard, became, known, as, the, father, of, modern, dentistry, despite, the, limitations, of, the, primitive, surgical, instruments, during, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, century, fauchard, was, a, highly, skilled, surgeon, who, made, remarkable, improvisations, of, dental, instruments, often, adapting, tools, from, watchmakers, jewelers, and, even, barbers, that, he, thought, could, be, used, in, dentistry, he, introduced, dental, fillings, as, treatment, for, dental, cavities, he, asserted, that, sugar, derived, acids, like, tartaric, acid, were, responsible, for, dental, decay, and, also, suggested, that, tumors, surrounding, the, teeth, and, in, the, gums, could, appear, in, the, later, stages, of, tooth, decay, fauchard, was, the, pioneer, of, dental, prosthesis, and, he, invented, many, methods, to, replace, lost, teeth, he, suggested, that, substitutes, could, be, made, from, carved, blocks, of, ivory, or, bone, he, also, introduced, dental, braces, although, they, were, initially, made, of, gold, he, discovered, that, the, teeth, position, could, be, corrected, as, the, teeth, would, follow, the, pattern, of, the, wires, waxed, linen, or, silk, threads, were, usually, employed, to, fasten, the, braces, his, contributions, to, the, world, of, dental, science, consist, primarily, of, his, 1728, publication, le, chirurgien, dentiste, or, the, surgeon, dentist, the, french, text, included, basic, oral, anatomy, and, function, dental, construction, and, various, operative, and, restorative, techniques, and, effectively, separated, dentistry, from, the, wider, category, of, surgery, after, fauchard, the, study, of, dentistry, rapidly, expanded, two, important, books, natural, history, of, human, teeth, 1771, and, practical, treatise, on, the, diseases, of, the, teeth, 1778, were, published, by, british, surgeon, john, hunter, in, 1763, he, entered, into, a, period, of, collaboration, with, the, london, based, dentist, james, spence, he, began, to, theorise, about, the, possibility, of, tooth, transplants, from, one, person, to, another, he, realised, that, the, chances, of, a, successful, tooth, transplant, initially, at, least, would, be, improved, if, the, donor, tooth, was, as, fresh, as, possible, and, was, matched, for, size, with, the, recipient, these, principles, are, still, used, in, the, transplantation, of, internal, organs, hunter, conducted, a, series, of, pioneering, operations, in, which, he, attempted, a, tooth, transplant, although, the, donated, teeth, never, properly, bonded, with, the, recipients, gums, one, of, hunter, s, patients, stated, that, he, had, three, which, lasted, for, six, years, a, remarkable, achievement, for, the, period, major, advances, in, science, were, made, in, the, 19th, century, and, dentistry, evolved, from, a, trade, to, a, profession, the, profession, came, under, government, regulation, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, the, uk, the, dentist, act, was, passed, in, 1878, and, the, british, dental, association, formed, in, 1879, in, the, same, year, francis, brodie, imlach, was, the, first, ever, dentist, to, be, elected, president, of, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, edinburgh, raising, dentistry, onto, a, par, with, clinical, surgery, for, the, first, time, long, term, occupational, noise, exposure, can, contribute, to, permanent, hearing, loss, which, is, referred, to, as, noise, induced, hearing, loss, nihl, and, tinnitus, noise, exposure, can, cause, excessive, stimulation, of, the, hearing, mechanism, which, damages, the, delicate, structures, of, the, inner, ear, nihl, can, occur, when, an, individual, is, exposed, to, sound, levels, above, 90, dba, according, to, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, regulations, state, that, the, permissible, noise, exposure, levels, for, individuals, is, 90, dba, for, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, exposure, limits, are, set, to, 85, dba, exposures, below, 85, dba, are, not, considered, to, be, hazardous, time, limits, are, placed, on, how, long, an, individual, can, stay, in, an, environment, above, 85, dba, before, it, causes, hearing, loss, osha, places, that, limitation, at, 8, hours, for, 85, dba, the, exposure, time, becomes, shorter, as, the, dba, level, increases, within, the, field, of, dentistry, a, variety, of, cleaning, tools, are, used, including, piezoelectric, and, sonic, scalers, and, ultrasonic, scalers, and, cleaners, while, a, majority, of, the, tools, do, not, exceed, 75, dba, prolonged, exposure, over, many, years, can, lead, to, hearing, loss, or, complaints, of, tinnitus, few, dentists, have, reported, using, personal, hearing, protective, devices, which, could, offset, any, potential, hearing, loss, or, tinnitus, there, is, a, movement, in, modern, dentistry, to, place, a, greater, emphasis, on, high, quality, scientific, evidence, in, decision, making, evidence, based, dentistry, ebd, uses, current, scientific, evidence, to, guide, decisions, it, is, an, approach, to, oral, health, that, requires, the, application, and, examination, of, relevant, scientific, data, related, to, the, patient, s, oral, and, medical, health, along, with, the, dentist, s, professional, skill, and, expertise, ebd, allows, dentists, to, stay, up, to, date, on, the, latest, procedures, and, patients, to, receive, improved, treatment, a, new, paradigm, for, medical, education, designed, to, incorporate, current, research, into, education, and, practice, was, developed, to, help, practitioners, provide, the, best, care, for, their, patients, it, was, first, introduced, by, gordon, guyatt, and, the, evidence, based, medicine, working, group, at, mcmaster, university, in, ontario, canada, in, the, 1990s, it, is, part, of, the, larger, movement, toward, evidence, based, medicine, and, other, evidence, based, practices, especially, since, a, major, part, of, dentistry, involves, dealing, with, oral, and, systemic, diseases, other, issues, relevant, to, the, dental, field, in, terms, of, evidence, based, research, and, evidence, based, practice, include, population, oral, health, dental, clinical, practice, tooth, morphology, etc, dentistry, is, unique, in, that, it, requires, dental, students, to, have, competence, based, clinical, skills, that, can, only, be, acquired, through, supervised, specialized, laboratory, training, and, direct, patient, care, this, necessitates, the, need, for, a, scientific, and, professional, basis, of, care, with, a, foundation, of, extensive, research, based, education, according, to, some, experts, the, accreditation, of, dental, schools, can, enhance, the, quality, and, professionalism, of, dental, education
