an, autoimmune, disease, is, a, condition, that, results, from, an, anomalous, response, of, the, adaptive, immune, system, wherein, it, mistakenly, targets, and, attacks, healthy, functioning, parts, of, the, body, as, if, they, were, foreign, organisms, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, more, than, 80, recognized, autoimmune, diseases, with, recent, scientific, evidence, suggesting, the, existence, of, potentially, more, than, 100, distinct, conditions, nearly, any, body, part, can, be, involved, autoimmune, diseases, are, a, separate, class, from, autoinflammatory, diseases, both, are, characterized, by, an, immune, system, malfunction, which, may, cause, similar, symptoms, such, as, rash, swelling, or, fatigue, but, the, cardinal, cause, or, mechanism, of, the, diseases, are, different, a, key, difference, is, a, malfunction, of, the, innate, immune, system, in, autoinflammatory, diseases, whereas, in, autoimmune, diseases, there, is, a, malfunction, of, the, adaptive, immune, system, symptoms, of, autoimmune, diseases, can, significantly, vary, primarily, based, on, the, specific, type, of, the, disease, and, the, body, part, that, it, affects, symptoms, are, often, diverse, and, can, be, fleeting, fluctuating, from, mild, to, severe, and, typically, comprise, low, grade, fever, fatigue, and, general, malaise, however, some, autoimmune, diseases, may, present, with, more, specific, symptoms, such, as, joint, pain, skin, rashes, e, g, urticaria, or, neurological, symptoms, the, exact, causes, of, autoimmune, diseases, remain, unclear, and, are, likely, multifactorial, involving, both, genetic, and, environmental, influences, while, some, diseases, like, lupus, exhibit, familial, aggregation, suggesting, a, genetic, predisposition, other, cases, have, been, associated, with, infectious, triggers, or, exposure, to, environmental, factors, implying, a, complex, interplay, between, genes, and, environment, in, their, etiology, some, of, the, most, common, diseases, that, are, generally, categorized, as, autoimmune, include, celiac, disease, type, 1, diabetes, graves, disease, inflammatory, bowel, diseases, such, as, crohn, s, disease, and, ulcerative, colitis, multiple, sclerosis, alopecia, areata, addison, s, disease, pernicious, anemia, psoriasis, rheumatoid, arthritis, and, systemic, lupus, erythematosus, diagnosing, autoimmune, diseases, can, be, challenging, due, to, their, diverse, presentations, and, the, transient, nature, of, many, symptoms, treatment, modalities, for, autoimmune, diseases, vary, based, on, the, type, of, disease, and, its, severity, therapeutic, approaches, primarily, aim, to, manage, symptoms, reduce, immune, system, activity, and, maintain, the, body, s, ability, to, fight, diseases, nonsteroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, nsaids, and, immunosuppressants, are, commonly, used, to, reduce, inflammation, and, control, the, overactive, immune, response, in, certain, cases, intravenous, immunoglobulin, may, be, administered, to, regulate, the, immune, system, despite, these, treatments, often, leading, to, symptom, improvement, they, usually, do, not, offer, a, cure, and, long, term, management, is, often, required, in, terms, of, prevalence, a, uk, study, found, that, 10, of, the, population, were, affected, by, an, autoimmune, disease, women, are, more, commonly, affected, than, men, autoimmune, diseases, predominantly, begin, in, adulthood, although, they, can, start, at, any, age, the, initial, recognition, of, autoimmune, diseases, dates, back, to, the, early, 1900s, and, since, then, advancements, in, understanding, and, management, of, these, conditions, have, been, substantial, though, much, more, is, needed, to, fully, unravel, their, complex, etiology, and, pathophysiology, autoimmune, diseases, represent, a, vast, and, diverse, category, of, disorders, that, despite, their, differences, share, some, common, symptomatic, threads, these, shared, symptoms, occur, as, a, result, of, the, body, s, immune, system, mistakenly, attacking, its, own, cells, and, tissues, causing, inflammation, and, damage, however, due, to, the, broad, range, of, autoimmune, diseases, the, specific, presentation, of, symptoms, can, significantly, vary, based, on, the, type, of, disease, the, organ, systems, affected, and, individual, factors, such, as, age, sex, hormonal, status, and, environmental, influences, an, individual, may, simultaneously, have, more, than, one, autoimmune, disease, known, as, polyautoimmunity, further, complicating, the, symptomatology, symptoms, that, are, commonly, associated, with, autoimmune, diseases, include, specific, autoimmune, diseases, have, a, wide, range, of, other, symptoms, with, examples, including, dry, mouth, dry, eyes, tingling, and, numbness, in, parts, of, the, body, unexpected, weight, loss, or, gain, and, diarrhoea, these, symptoms, often, reflect, the, body, s, systemic, inflammatory, response, however, their, occurrence, and, intensity, can, fluctuate, over, time, leading, to, periods, of, heightened, disease, activity, referred, to, as, flare, ups, and, periods, of, relative, inactivity, known, as, remissions, the, specific, presentation, of, symptoms, largely, depends, on, the, location, and, type, of, autoimmune, response, for, instance, in, rheumatoid, arthritis, an, autoimmune, disease, primarily, affecting, the, joints, symptoms, typically, include, joint, pain, swelling, and, stiffness, on, the, other, hand, type, 1, diabetes, which, results, from, an, autoimmune, attack, on, the, insulin, producing, cells, of, the, pancreas, primarily, presents, with, symptoms, related, to, high, blood, sugar, such, as, increased, thirst, frequent, urination, and, unexplained, weight, loss, commonly, affected, areas, in, autoimmune, diseases, include, blood, vessels, connective, tissues, joints, muscles, red, blood, cells, skin, and, endocrine, glands, such, as, the, thyroid, gland, in, diseases, like, hashimoto, s, thyroiditis, and, graves, disease, and, the, pancreas, in, type, 1, diabetes, the, impacts, of, these, diseases, can, range, from, localized, damage, to, certain, tissues, alteration, in, organ, growth, and, function, to, more, systemic, effects, when, multiple, tissues, throughout, the, body, are, affected, the, appearance, of, these, signs, and, symptoms, can, not, only, provide, clues, for, the, diagnosis, of, an, autoimmune, condition, often, in, conjunction, with, tests, for, specific, biological, markers, but, also, help, monitor, disease, progression, and, response, to, treatment, ultimately, due, to, the, diverse, nature, of, autoimmune, diseases, a, multidimensional, approach, is, often, needed, for, the, management, of, these, conditions, taking, into, consideration, the, variety, of, symptoms, and, their, impacts, on, individuals, lives, while, it, is, estimated, that, over, 80, recognized, types, of, autoimmune, diseases, exist, this, section, provides, an, overview, of, some, of, the, most, common, and, well, studied, forms, coeliac, disease, is, an, immune, reaction, to, eating, gluten, a, protein, found, in, wheat, barley, and, rye, for, those, with, the, disease, eating, gluten, triggers, an, immune, response, in, the, small, intestine, leading, to, damage, on, the, villi, small, fingerlike, projections, that, line, the, small, intestine, and, promote, nutrient, absorption, this, explains, the, increased, risk, of, gastrointestinal, cancers, as, the, gastrointestinal, tract, includes, the, esophagus, stomach, small, intestine, large, intestine, rectum, and, anus, all, areas, that, the, ingested, gluten, would, traverse, in, digestion, the, incidence, of, gastrointestinal, cancer, can, be, partially, reduced, or, eliminated, if, a, patient, removes, gluten, from, their, diet, additionally, coeliac, disease, is, correlated, with, lymphoproliferative, disorders, graves, disease, is, a, condition, characterized, by, development, of, autoantibodies, to, thyroid, stimulating, hormone, tsh, receptors, trab, the, binding, of, trab, autoantibodies, to, tsh, receptor, results, in, unregulated, production, and, release, of, thyroid, hormone, which, can, lead, to, stimulatory, effects, such, as, rapid, heart, rate, weight, loss, nervousness, and, irritability, other, symptoms, more, specific, to, graves, disease, include, bulging, eyes, and, swelling, of, the, lower, legs, inflammatory, bowel, disease, ibd, encompasses, conditions, characterized, by, chronic, inflammation, of, the, digestive, tract, including, crohn, s, disease, and, ulcerative, colitis, in, both, cases, individuals, with, ibd, lose, immune, tolerance, for, normal, bacteria, present, in, the, gut, microbiome, symptoms, include, severe, diarrhea, abdominal, pain, fatigue, and, weight, loss, ibd, is, associated, with, cancers, of, the, gastrointestinal, tract, and, some, lymphoproliferative, cancers, multiple, sclerosis, ms, is, a, neurodegenerative, disease, in, which, the, immune, system, attacks, myelin, a, protective, covering, of, nerve, fibers, in, the, central, nervous, system, causing, communication, problems, between, the, brain, and, the, rest, of, the, body, symptoms, can, include, fatigue, difficulty, walking, numbness, or, tingling, muscle, weakness, and, problems, with, coordination, and, balance, ms, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, central, nervous, system, cancer, primarily, in, the, brain, rheumatoid, arthritis, ra, primarily, targets, the, joints, causing, persistent, inflammation, that, results, in, joint, damage, and, pain, it, is, often, symmetrical, meaning, that, if, one, hand, or, knee, has, it, the, other, one, does, too, ra, can, also, affect, the, heart, lungs, and, eyes, additionally, the, chronic, inflammation, and, over, activation, of, the, immune, system, creates, an, environment, that, favors, further, malignant, transformation, of, other, cells, perhaps, explaining, the, associations, with, cancer, of, the, lungs, and, skin, as, well, as, the, increased, risk, of, other, hematologic, cancers, none, of, which, are, directly, affected, by, the, inflammation, of, joints, psoriasis, is, a, skin, condition, characterized, by, the, rapid, buildup, of, skin, cells, leading, to, scaling, on, the, skin, s, surface, inflammation, and, redness, around, the, scales, is, common, some, individuals, with, psoriasis, also, develop, psoriatic, arthritis, which, causes, joint, pain, stiffness, and, swelling, sj, gren, syndrome, sjs, ss, is, a, long, term, autoimmune, disease, that, affects, the, body, s, moisture, producing, glands, lacrimal, and, salivary, and, often, seriously, affects, other, organ, systems, such, as, the, lungs, kidneys, and, nervous, system, systemic, lupus, erythematosus, sle, referred, to, simply, as, lupus, is, a, systemic, autoimmune, disease, that, affects, multiple, organs, including, the, skin, joints, kidneys, and, the, nervous, system, it, is, characterized, by, a, widespread, loss, of, immune, tolerance, the, disease, is, characterized, by, periods, of, flares, and, remissions, and, symptoms, range, from, mild, to, severe, women, especially, those, of, childbearing, age, are, disproportionately, affected, type, 1, diabetes, is, a, condition, resulting, from, the, immune, system, attacking, insulin, producing, beta, cells, in, the, pancreas, leading, to, high, blood, sugar, levels, symptoms, include, increased, thirst, frequent, urination, and, unexplained, weight, loss, it, is, most, commonly, diagnosed, in, children, and, young, adults, undifferentiated, connective, tissue, disease, uctd, occurs, when, people, have, features, of, connective, tissue, disease, such, as, blood, test, results, and, external, characteristics, but, do, not, fulfill, the, diagnostic, criteria, established, for, any, one, connective, tissue, disease, some, 30, 40, transition, to, a, specific, connective, tissue, disease, over, time, the, exact, causes, of, autoimmune, diseases, remain, largely, unknown, however, research, has, suggested, that, a, combination, of, genetic, environmental, and, hormonal, factors, as, well, as, certain, infections, may, contribute, to, the, development, of, these, disorders, the, human, immune, system, is, equipped, with, several, mechanisms, to, maintain, a, delicate, balance, between, defending, against, foreign, invaders, and, protecting, its, own, cells, to, achieve, this, it, generates, both, t, cells, and, b, cells, which, are, capable, of, reacting, with, self, proteins, however, in, a, healthy, immune, response, self, reactive, cells, are, generally, either, eliminated, before, they, become, active, rendered, inert, via, a, process, called, anergy, or, their, activities, are, suppressed, by, regulatory, cells, a, familial, tendency, to, develop, autoimmune, diseases, suggests, a, genetic, component, some, conditions, like, lupus, and, multiple, sclerosis, often, occur, in, several, members, of, the, same, family, indicating, a, potential, hereditary, link, additionally, certain, genes, have, been, identified, that, increase, the, risk, of, developing, specific, autoimmune, diseases, evidence, suggests, a, strong, genetic, component, in, the, development, of, autoimmune, diseases, for, instance, conditions, such, as, lupus, and, multiple, sclerosis, frequently, appear, in, multiple, members, of, the, same, family, signifying, a, potential, hereditary, link, furthermore, certain, genes, have, been, identified, that, augment, the, risk, of, developing, specific, autoimmune, diseases, experimental, methods, like, genome, wide, association, studies, gwas, have, proven, instrumental, in, pinpointing, genetic, risk, variants, potentially, responsible, for, autoimmune, diseases, for, example, these, studies, have, been, used, to, identify, risk, variants, for, diseases, such, as, type, 1, diabetes, and, rheumatoid, arthritis, in, twin, studies, autoimmune, diseases, consistently, demonstrate, a, higher, concordance, rate, among, identical, twins, compared, with, fraternal, twins, for, instance, the, rate, in, multiple, sclerosis, is, 35, in, identical, twins, compared, to, 6, in, fraternal, twins, there, is, increasing, evidence, that, certain, genes, selected, during, evolution, offer, a, balance, between, susceptibility, to, infection, and, the, capacity, to, avoid, autoimmune, diseases, for, example, variants, in, the, erap2, gene, provide, some, resistance, to, infection, even, though, they, increase, the, risk, of, autoimmunity, positive, selection, in, contrast, variants, in, the, tyk2, gene, protect, against, autoimmune, diseases, but, increase, the, risk, of, infection, negative, selection, this, suggests, the, benefits, of, infection, resistance, may, outweigh, the, risks, of, autoimmune, diseases, particularly, given, the, historically, high, risk, of, infection, several, experimental, methods, such, as, the, genome, wide, association, studies, gwas, have, been, used, to, identify, genetic, risk, variants, that, may, be, responsible, for, diseases, such, as, type, 1, diabetes, and, rheumatoid, arthritis, a, significant, number, of, environmental, factors, have, been, implicated, in, the, development, and, progression, of, various, autoimmune, diseases, either, directly, or, as, catalysts, current, research, suggests, that, up, to, seventy, percent, of, autoimmune, diseases, could, be, attributed, to, environmental, influences, which, encompass, an, array, of, elements, such, as, chemicals, infectious, agents, dietary, habits, and, gut, dysbiosis, however, a, unifying, theory, that, definitively, explains, the, onset, of, autoimmune, diseases, remains, elusive, emphasizing, the, complexity, and, multifaceted, nature, of, these, conditions, various, environmental, triggers, are, identified, some, of, which, include, chemicals, which, are, either, a, part, of, the, immediate, environment, or, found, in, drugs, are, key, players, in, this, context, examples, of, such, chemicals, include, hydrazines, hair, dyes, trichloroethylene, tartrazines, hazardous, wastes, and, industrial, emissions, ultraviolet, uv, radiation, has, been, implicated, as, a, potential, causative, factor, in, the, development, of, autoimmune, diseases, such, as, dermatomyositis, furthermore, exposure, to, pesticides, has, been, linked, with, an, increased, risk, of, developing, rheumatoid, arthritis, vitamin, d, on, the, other, hand, appears, to, play, a, protective, role, particularly, in, older, populations, by, preventing, immune, dysfunctions, infectious, agents, are, also, being, increasingly, recognized, for, their, role, as, t, cell, activators, a, crucial, step, in, triggering, autoimmune, diseases, the, exact, mechanisms, by, which, they, contribute, to, disease, onset, remain, to, be, fully, understood, for, instance, certain, autoimmune, conditions, like, guillain, barre, syndrome, and, rheumatic, fever, are, thought, to, be, triggered, by, infections, furthermore, analysis, of, large, scale, data, has, revealed, a, significant, link, between, sars, cov, 2, infection, the, causative, agent, of, covid, 19, and, an, increased, risk, of, developing, a, wide, range, of, new, onset, autoimmune, diseases, women, typically, make, up, some, 80, of, autoimmune, disease, patients, whilst, many, proposals, have, been, made, for, the, cause, of, this, high, weighting, no, clear, explanation, is, available, a, possible, role, for, hormonal, factors, has, been, suggested, for, example, some, autoimmune, diseases, tend, to, flare, during, pregnancy, possibly, as, an, evolutionary, mechanism, to, increase, health, protection, for, the, child, when, hormone, levels, are, high, and, improve, after, menopause, when, hormone, levels, decrease, women, may, also, naturally, have, autoimmune, disease, trigger, events, in, puberty, and, pregnancy, under, reporting, by, men, may, also, be, a, factor, as, men, may, interact, less, with, the, health, system, than, women, certain, viral, and, bacterial, infections, have, been, linked, to, autoimmune, diseases, for, instance, research, suggests, that, the, bacterium, that, causes, strep, throat, streptococcus, pyogenes, might, trigger, rheumatic, fever, an, autoimmune, response, affecting, the, heart, similarly, some, studies, propose, a, link, between, the, epstein, barr, virus, responsible, for, mononucleosis, and, the, subsequent, development, of, multiple, sclerosis, or, lupus, another, area, of, interest, is, the, immune, system, s, ability, to, distinguish, between, self, and, non, self, a, function, that, is, compromised, in, autoimmune, diseases, in, healthy, individuals, immune, tolerance, prevents, the, immune, system, from, attacking, the, body, s, own, cells, when, this, process, fails, the, immune, system, may, produce, antibodies, against, its, own, tissues, leading, to, an, autoimmune, response, the, elimination, of, self, reactive, t, cells, occurs, primarily, through, a, mechanism, known, as, negative, selection, within, the, thymus, an, organ, responsible, for, the, maturation, of, t, cells, this, process, serves, as, a, key, line, of, defense, against, autoimmunity, if, these, protective, mechanisms, fail, a, pool, of, self, reactive, cells, can, become, functional, within, the, immune, system, contributing, to, the, development, of, autoimmune, diseases, some, infectious, agents, like, campylobacter, jejuni, bear, antigens, that, resemble, but, are, not, identical, to, the, body, s, self, molecules, this, phenomenon, known, as, molecular, mimicry, can, lead, to, cross, reactivity, where, the, immune, response, to, such, infections, inadvertently, results, in, the, production, of, antibodies, that, also, react, with, self, antigens, an, example, of, this, is, guillain, barr, syndrome, in, which, antibodies, generated, in, response, to, a, c, jejuni, infection, also, react, with, the, gangliosides, in, the, myelin, sheath, of, peripheral, nerve, axons, diagnosing, autoimmune, disorders, can, be, complex, due, to, the, wide, range, of, diseases, within, this, category, and, their, often, overlapping, symptoms, accurate, diagnosis, is, crucial, for, determining, appropriate, treatment, strategies, generally, the, diagnostic, process, involves, a, combination, of, medical, history, evaluation, physical, examination, laboratory, tests, and, in, some, cases, imaging, or, biopsies, the, first, step, in, diagnosing, autoimmune, disorders, typically, involves, a, thorough, evaluation, of, the, patient, s, medical, history, and, a, comprehensive, physical, examination, clinicians, often, pay, close, attention, to, the, patient, s, symptoms, family, history, of, autoimmune, diseases, and, any, exposure, to, environmental, factors, that, might, trigger, an, autoimmune, response, the, physical, examination, can, reveal, signs, of, inflammation, or, organ, damage, which, are, common, features, of, autoimmune, disorders, laboratory, testing, plays, a, pivotal, role, in, the, diagnosis, of, autoimmune, diseases, these, tests, can, identify, the, presence, of, certain, autoantibodies, or, other, immune, markers, that, indicate, a, self, directed, immune, response, in, some, cases, imaging, studies, may, be, used, to, assess, the, extent, of, organ, involvement, and, damage, for, example, chest, x, rays, or, ct, scans, can, identify, lung, involvement, in, diseases, like, rheumatoid, arthritis, or, systemic, lupus, erythematosus, while, an, mri, can, reveal, inflammation, or, damage, in, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, in, multiple, sclerosis, given, the, variety, and, nonspecific, nature, of, symptoms, that, can, be, associated, with, autoimmune, diseases, differential, diagnosis, determining, which, of, several, diseases, with, similar, symptoms, is, causing, a, patient, s, illness, is, an, important, part, of, the, diagnostic, process, this, often, involves, ruling, out, other, potential, causes, of, symptoms, such, as, infections, malignancies, or, genetic, disorders, given, the, systemic, nature, of, many, autoimmune, disorders, a, multidisciplinary, approach, may, be, necessary, for, their, diagnosis, and, management, this, can, involve, rheumatologists, endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, neurologists, dermatologists, and, other, specialists, depending, on, the, organs, or, systems, affected, by, the, disease, in, summary, the, diagnosis, of, autoimmune, disorders, is, a, complex, process, that, requires, a, thorough, evaluation, of, clinical, laboratory, and, imaging, data, due, to, the, diverse, nature, of, these, diseases, an, individualized, approach, often, involving, multiple, specialists, is, crucial, for, an, accurate, diagnosis, treatment, depends, on, the, type, and, severity, of, the, condition, the, majority, of, the, autoimmune, diseases, are, chronic, and, there, is, no, definitive, cure, but, symptoms, can, be, alleviated, and, controlled, with, treatment, standard, treatment, methods, include, traditional, treatment, options, include, immunosuppressant, drugs, to, reduce, the, immune, response, against, the, body, s, own, tissues, such, as, because, immunosuppressants, weaken, the, overall, immune, response, relief, of, symptoms, must, be, balanced, with, preserving, the, patient, s, ability, to, combat, infections, which, could, potentially, be, life, threatening, non, traditional, treatments, are, being, researched, developed, and, used, especially, when, traditional, treatments, fail, these, methods, aim, to, either, block, the, activation, of, pathogenic, cells, in, the, body, or, alter, the, pathway, that, suppresses, these, cells, naturally, these, treatments, aim, to, be, less, toxic, to, the, patient, and, have, more, specific, targets, such, options, include, the, first, estimate, of, us, prevalence, for, autoimmune, diseases, as, a, group, was, published, in, 1997, by, jacobson, et, al, they, reported, us, prevalence, to, be, around, 9, million, applying, prevalence, estimates, for, 24, diseases, to, a, us, population, of, 279, million, jacobson, s, work, was, updated, by, hayter, cook, in, 2012, this, study, used, witebsky, s, postulates, as, revised, by, rose, bona, to, extend, the, list, to, 81, diseases, and, estimated, overall, cumulative, us, prevalence, for, the, 81, autoimmune, diseases, at, 5, 0, with, 3, 0, for, males, and, 7, 1, for, females, the, estimated, community, prevalence, which, takes, into, account, the, observation, that, many, people, have, more, than, one, autoimmune, disease, was, 4, 5, overall, with, 2, 7, for, males, and, 6, 4, for, females, national, health, and, nutrition, examination, surveys, conducted, in, the, us, from, the, 1980s, to, 2020, showed, an, increase, of, antinuclear, antibodies, a, common, biomarker, for, autoimmune, diseases, this, shows, that, there, has, been, an, increase, in, the, prevalence, of, autoimmune, diseases, pointing, to, a, stronger, influence, of, environment, factors, as, a, risk, factor, for, autoimmune, diseases, a, 2024, estimate, was, that, 1, in, 15, people, in, the, u, s, had, at, least, one, autoimmune, disease, in, both, autoimmune, and, inflammatory, diseases, the, condition, arises, through, aberrant, reactions, of, the, human, adaptive, or, innate, immune, systems, in, autoimmunity, the, patient, s, immune, system, is, activated, against, the, body, s, own, proteins, in, chronic, inflammatory, diseases, neutrophils, and, other, leukocytes, are, constitutively, recruited, by, cytokines, and, chemokines, resulting, in, tissue, damage, mitigation, of, inflammation, by, activation, of, anti, inflammatory, genes, and, the, suppression, of, inflammatory, genes, in, immune, cells, is, a, promising, therapeutic, approach, there, is, a, body, of, evidence, that, once, the, production, of, autoantibodies, has, been, initialized, autoantibodies, have, the, capacity, to, maintain, their, own, production, stem, cell, transplantation, is, being, studied, and, has, shown, promising, results, in, certain, cases, medical, trials, to, replace, the, pancreatic, cells, that, are, destroyed, in, type, 1, diabetes, are, in, progress, according, to, this, theory, the, effector, function, of, the, immune, response, is, mediated, by, the, glycans, polysaccharides, displayed, by, the, cells, and, humoral, components, of, the, immune, system, individuals, with, autoimmunity, have, alterations, in, their, glycosylation, profile, such, that, a, proinflammatory, immune, response, is, favored, it, is, further, hypothesized, that, individual, autoimmune, diseases, will, have, unique, glycan, signatures, according, to, the, hygiene, hypothesis, high, levels, of, cleanliness, expose, children, to, fewer, antigens, than, in, the, past, causing, their, immune, systems, to, become, overactive, and, more, likely, to, misidentify, own, tissues, as, foreign, resulting, in, autoimmune, or, allergic, conditions, such, as, asthma, vitamin, d, is, known, as, an, immune, regulator, that, assists, in, the, adaptive, and, innate, immune, response, a, deficiency, in, vitamin, d, from, hereditary, or, environmental, influence, can, lead, to, a, more, inefficient, and, weaker, immune, response, and, seen, as, a, contributing, factor, to, the, development, of, autoimmune, diseases, with, vitamin, d, present, vitamin, d, response, elements, vdre, are, encoded, and, expressed, via, pattern, recognition, receptors, prr, responses, and, the, genes, associated, with, those, responses, the, specific, dna, target, sequence, expressed, is, known, as, 1, 25, oh, 2d3, the, expression, of, 1, 25, oh, 2d3, can, be, induced, by, macrophages, dendritic, cells, t, cells, and, b, cells, in, the, presence, of, 1, 25, oh, 2d3, the, immune, system, s, production, of, inflammatory, cytokines, are, suppressed, and, more, tolerogenic, regulatory, t, cells, are, expressed, this, is, due, to, vitamin, d, s, influence, on, cell, maturation, specifically, t, cells, and, their, phenotype, expression, lack, of, 1, 25, oh, 2d3, expression, can, lead, to, less, tolerant, regulatory, t, cells, larger, presentation, of, antigens, to, less, tolerant, t, cells, and, increased, inflammatory, response
