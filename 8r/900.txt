chlorophyta, from, greek, chloros, yellow, green, and, phyton, plant, is, a, division, of, green, algae, informally, called, chlorophytes, chlorophytes, are, eukaryotic, organisms, composed, of, cells, with, a, variety, of, coverings, or, walls, and, usually, a, single, green, chloroplast, in, each, cell, they, are, structurally, diverse, most, groups, of, chlorophytes, are, unicellular, such, as, the, earliest, diverging, prasinophytes, but, in, two, major, classes, chlorophyceae, and, ulvophyceae, there, is, an, evolutionary, trend, toward, various, types, of, complex, colonies, and, even, multicellularity, chlorophyte, cells, contain, green, chloroplasts, surrounded, by, a, double, membrane, envelope, these, contain, chlorophylls, a, and, b, and, the, carotenoids, carotin, lutein, zeaxanthin, antheraxanthin, violaxanthin, and, neoxanthin, which, are, also, present, in, the, leaves, of, land, plants, some, special, carotenoids, are, present, in, certain, groups, or, are, synthesized, under, specific, environmental, factors, such, as, siphonaxanthin, prasinoxanthin, echinenon, canthaxanthin, loroxanthin, and, astaxanthin, they, accumulate, carotenoids, under, nitrogen, deficiency, high, irradiance, of, sunlight, or, high, salinity, in, addition, they, store, starch, inside, the, chloroplast, as, carbohydrate, reserves, the, thylakoids, can, appear, single, or, in, stacks, in, contrast, to, other, divisions, of, algae, such, as, ochrophyta, chlorophytes, lack, a, chloroplast, endoplasmic, reticulum, chlorophytes, often, form, zoospores, or, gametes, that, generally, have, two, or, four, flagella, of, equal, length, flagella, have, been, independently, lost, in, some, groups, such, as, the, chlorococcales, flagellate, chlorophyte, cells, have, symmetrical, cross, shaped, cruciate, root, systems, in, which, ciliary, rootlets, with, a, variable, high, number, of, microtubules, alternate, with, rootlets, composed, of, just, two, microtubules, this, forms, an, arrangement, known, as, the, x, 2, x, 2, arrangement, unique, to, chlorophytes, they, are, also, distinguished, from, streptophytes, by, the, place, where, their, flagella, are, inserted, directly, at, the, cell, apex, whereas, streptophyte, flagella, are, inserted, at, the, sides, of, the, cell, apex, sub, apically, the, surface, of, flagella, lacks, microtubular, hairs, but, some, genera, present, scales, or, fibrillar, hairs, chlorophytes, and, streptophytes, differ, in, the, enzymes, and, organelles, involved, in, photorespiration, chlorophyte, algae, use, a, dehydrogenase, inside, the, mitochondria, to, process, glycolate, during, photorespiration, in, contrast, streptophytes, including, land, plants, use, peroxisomes, that, contain, glycolate, oxidase, which, converts, glycolate, to, glycoxylate, and, the, hydrogen, peroxide, created, as, a, subproduct, is, reduced, by, catalases, located, in, the, same, organelles, asexual, reproduction, is, widely, observed, in, chlorophytes, among, core, chlorophytes, both, unicellular, groups, can, reproduce, asexually, through, autospores, wall, less, zoospores, fragmentation, plain, cell, division, and, exceptionally, budding, multicellular, thalli, can, reproduce, asexually, through, motile, zoospores, non, motile, aplanospores, autospores, filament, fragmentation, differentiated, resting, cells, and, even, unmated, gametes, colonial, groups, can, reproduce, asexually, through, the, formation, of, autocolonies, where, each, cell, divides, to, form, a, colony, with, the, same, number, and, arrangement, of, cells, as, the, parent, colony, many, chlorophytes, exclusively, conduct, asexual, reproduction, but, some, display, sexual, reproduction, which, may, be, isogamous, i, e, gametes, of, both, sexes, are, identical, anisogamous, gametes, are, different, or, oogamous, gametes, are, sperm, and, egg, cells, with, an, evolutionary, tendency, towards, oogamy, their, gametes, are, usually, specialized, cells, differentiated, from, vegetative, cells, although, in, unicellular, volvocales, the, vegetative, cells, can, function, simultaneously, as, gametes, most, chlorophytes, have, a, diplontic, life, cycle, also, known, as, zygotic, where, the, gametes, fuse, into, a, zygote, which, germinates, grows, and, eventually, undergoes, meiosis, to, produce, haploid, spores, gametes, similarly, to, ochrophytes, and, animals, some, exceptions, display, a, haplodiplontic, life, cycle, where, there, is, an, alternation, of, generations, similarly, to, land, plants, these, generations, can, be, isomorphic, i, e, of, similar, shape, and, size, or, heteromorphic, the, formation, of, reproductive, cells, usually, does, not, occur, in, specialized, cells, but, some, ulvophyceae, have, specialized, reproductive, structures, gametangia, to, produce, gametes, and, sporangia, to, produce, spores, the, earliest, diverging, unicellular, chlorophytes, prasinophytes, produce, walled, resistant, stages, called, cysts, or, phycoma, stages, before, reproduction, in, some, groups, the, cysts, are, as, large, as, 230, m, in, diameter, to, develop, them, the, flagellate, cells, form, an, inner, wall, by, discharging, mucilage, vesicles, to, the, outside, increase, the, level, of, lipids, in, the, cytoplasm, to, enhance, buoyancy, and, finally, develop, an, outer, wall, inside, the, cysts, the, nucleus, and, cytoplasm, undergo, division, into, numerous, flagellate, cells, that, are, released, by, rupturing, the, wall, in, some, species, these, daughter, cells, have, been, confirmed, to, be, gametes, otherwise, sexual, reproduction, is, unknown, in, prasinophytes, chlorophytes, are, an, important, portion, of, the, phytoplankton, in, both, freshwater, and, marine, habitats, fixating, more, than, a, billion, tons, of, carbon, every, year, they, also, live, as, multicellular, macroalgae, or, seaweeds, settled, along, rocky, ocean, shores, most, species, of, chlorophyta, are, aquatic, prevalent, in, both, marine, and, freshwater, environments, about, 90, of, all, known, species, live, in, freshwater, some, species, have, adapted, to, a, wide, range, of, terrestrial, environments, for, example, chlamydomonas, nivalis, lives, on, summer, alpine, snowfields, and, trentepohlia, species, live, attached, to, rocks, or, woody, parts, of, trees, several, species, have, adapted, to, specialised, and, extreme, environments, such, as, deserts, arctic, environments, hypersaline, habitats, marine, deep, waters, deep, sea, hydrothermal, vents, and, habitats, that, experience, extreme, changes, in, temperature, light, and, salinity, some, groups, such, as, the, trentepohliales, are, exclusively, found, on, land, several, species, of, chlorophyta, live, in, symbiosis, with, a, diverse, range, of, eukaryotes, including, fungi, to, form, lichens, ciliates, forams, cnidarians, and, molluscs, some, species, of, chlorophyta, are, heterotrophic, either, free, living, or, parasitic, others, are, mixotrophic, bacterivores, through, phagocytosis, two, common, species, of, the, heterotrophic, green, alga, prototheca, are, pathogenic, and, can, cause, the, disease, protothecosis, in, humans, and, animals, with, the, exception, of, the, three, classes, ulvophyceae, trebouxiophyceae, and, chlorophyceae, in, the, utc, clade, which, show, various, degrees, of, multicellularity, all, the, chlorophyta, lineages, are, unicellular, some, members, of, the, group, form, symbiotic, relationships, with, protozoa, sponges, and, cnidarians, others, form, symbiotic, relationships, with, fungi, to, form, lichens, but, the, majority, of, species, are, free, living, all, members, of, the, clade, have, motile, flagellated, swimming, cells, monostroma, kuroshiense, an, edible, green, alga, cultivated, worldwide, and, most, expensive, among, green, algae, belongs, to, this, group, the, first, mention, of, chlorophyta, belongs, to, german, botanist, heinrich, gottlieb, ludwig, reichenbach, in, his, 1828, work, conspectus, regni, vegetabilis, under, this, name, he, grouped, all, algae, mosses, musci, and, ferns, filices, as, well, as, some, seed, plants, zamia, and, cycas, this, usage, did, not, gain, popularity, in, 1914, bohemian, botanist, adolf, pascher, modified, the, name, to, encompass, exclusively, green, algae, that, is, algae, which, contain, chlorophylls, a, and, b, and, store, starch, in, their, chloroplasts, pascher, established, a, scheme, where, chlorophyta, was, composed, of, two, groups, chlorophyceae, which, included, algae, now, known, as, chlorophyta, and, conjugatae, which, are, now, known, as, zygnematales, and, belong, to, the, streptophyta, clade, from, which, land, plants, evolved, during, the, 20th, century, many, different, classification, schemes, for, the, chlorophyta, arose, the, smith, system, published, in, 1938, by, american, botanist, gilbert, morgan, smith, distinguished, two, classes, chlorophyceae, which, contained, all, green, algae, unicellular, and, multicellular, that, did, not, grow, through, an, apical, cell, and, charophyceae, which, contained, only, multicellular, green, algae, that, grew, via, an, apical, cell, and, had, special, sterile, envelopes, to, protect, the, sex, organs, with, the, advent, of, electron, microscopy, studies, botanists, published, various, classification, proposals, based, on, finer, cellular, structures, and, phenomena, such, as, mitosis, cytokinesis, cytoskeleton, flagella, and, cell, wall, polysaccharides, british, botanist, frank, eric, round, proposed, in, 1971, a, scheme, which, distinguishes, chlorophyta, from, other, green, algal, divisions, charophyta, prasinophyta, and, euglenophyta, he, included, four, classes, of, chlorophytes, zygnemaphyceae, oedogoniophyceae, chlorophyceae, and, bryopsidophyceae, other, proposals, retained, the, chlorophyta, as, containing, all, green, algae, and, varied, from, one, another, in, the, number, of, classes, for, example, the, 1984, proposal, by, mattox, stewart, included, five, classes, while, the, 1985, proposal, by, bold, wynne, included, only, two, and, the, 1995, proposal, by, christiaan, van, den, hoek, and, coauthors, included, up, to, eleven, classes, the, modern, usage, of, the, name, chlorophyta, was, established, in, 2004, when, phycologists, lewis, mccourt, firmly, separated, the, chlorophytes, from, the, streptophytes, on, the, basis, of, molecular, phylogenetics, all, green, algae, that, were, more, closely, related, to, land, plants, than, to, chlorophytes, were, grouped, as, a, paraphyletic, division, charophyta, within, the, green, algae, the, earliest, branching, lineages, were, grouped, under, the, informal, name, of, prasinophytes, and, they, were, all, believed, to, belong, to, the, chlorophyta, clade, however, in, 2020, a, study, recovered, a, new, clade, and, division, known, as, prasinodermophyta, which, contains, two, prasinophyte, lineages, previously, considered, chlorophytes, below, is, a, cladogram, representing, the, current, state, of, green, algal, classification, prasinodermophyceae, palmophyllophyceae, pyramimonadophyceae, mamiellophyceae, nephroselmidophyceae, pseudoscourfieldiales, picocystophyceae, chloropicophyceae, chlorodendrophyceae, trebouxiophyceae, chlorophyceae, ulvophyceae, pedinophyceae, mesostigmatophyceae, chlorokybophyceae, klebsormidiophyceae, charophyceae, coleochaetophyceae, zygnematophyceae, embryophyta, land, plants, currently, eleven, chlorophyte, classes, are, accepted, here, presented, in, alphabetical, order, with, some, of, their, characteristics, and, biodiversity, in, february, 2020, the, fossilized, remains, of, a, green, alga, named, proterocladus, antiquus, were, discovered, in, the, northern, province, of, liaoning, china, at, around, a, billion, years, old, it, is, believed, to, be, one, of, the, oldest, examples, of, a, multicellular, chlorophyte, it, is, currently, classified, as, a, member, of, order, siphonocladales, class, ulvophyceae, in, 2023, a, study, calculated, the, molecular, age, of, green, algae, as, calibrated, by, this, fossil, the, study, estimated, the, origin, of, chlorophyta, within, the, mesoproterozoic, era, at, around, 2, 04, 1, 23, billion, years, ago, among, chlorophytes, a, small, group, known, as, the, volvocine, green, algae, is, being, researched, to, understand, the, origins, of, cell, differentiation, and, multicellularity, in, particular, the, unicellular, flagellate, chlamydomonas, reinhardtii, and, the, colonial, organism, volvox, carteri, are, object, of, interest, due, to, sharing, homologous, genes, that, in, volvox, are, directly, involved, in, the, development, of, two, different, cell, types, with, full, division, of, labor, between, swimming, and, reproduction, whereas, in, chlamydomonas, only, one, cell, type, exists, that, can, function, as, a, gamete, other, volvocine, species, with, intermediate, characters, between, these, two, are, studied, to, further, understand, the, transition, towards, the, cellular, division, of, labor, namely, gonium, pectorale, pandorina, morum, eudorina, elegans, and, pleodorina, starrii, chlorophyte, microalgae, are, a, valuable, source, of, biofuel, and, various, chemicals, and, products, in, industrial, amounts, such, as, carotenoids, vitamins, and, unsaturated, fatty, acids, the, genus, botryococcus, is, an, efficient, producer, of, hydrocarbons, which, are, converted, into, biodiesel, various, genera, chlorella, scenedesmus, haematococcus, dunaliella, and, tetraselmis, are, used, as, cellular, factories, of, biomass, lipids, and, different, vitamins, for, either, human, or, animal, consumption, and, even, for, usage, as, pharmaceuticals, some, of, their, pigments, are, employed, for, cosmetics
