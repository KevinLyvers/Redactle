weevils, are, beetles, belonging, to, the, superfamily, curculionoidea, known, for, their, elongated, snouts, they, are, usually, small, less, than, 6, mm, 1, 4, in, in, length, and, herbivorous, approximately, 97, 000, species, of, weevils, are, known, they, belong, to, several, families, with, most, of, them, in, the, family, curculionidae, the, true, weevils, it, also, includes, bark, beetles, which, while, morphologically, dissimilar, to, other, weevils, in, lacking, the, distinctive, snout, is, a, subfamily, of, curculionidae, some, other, beetles, although, not, closely, related, bear, the, name, weevil, such, as, the, biscuit, weevil, stegobium, paniceum, which, belongs, to, the, family, ptinidae, many, weevils, are, considered, pests, because, of, their, ability, to, damage, and, kill, crops, the, grain, or, wheat, weevil, sitophilus, granarius, damages, stored, grain, as, does, the, maize, weevil, sitophilus, zeamais, among, others, the, boll, weevil, anthonomus, grandis, attacks, cotton, crops, it, lays, its, eggs, inside, cotton, bolls, and, the, larvae, eat, their, way, out, other, weevils, are, used, for, biological, control, of, invasive, plants, a, weevil, s, rostrum, or, elongated, snout, hosts, chewing, mouthparts, instead, of, the, piercing, mouthparts, that, proboscis, possessing, insects, are, known, for, the, mouthparts, are, often, used, to, excavate, tunnels, into, grains, in, more, derived, weevils, the, rostrum, has, a, groove, in, which, the, weevil, can, fold, the, first, segment, of, its, antennae, most, weevils, have, the, ability, to, fly, including, pest, species, such, as, the, rice, weevil, though, a, significant, number, are, flightless, such, as, the, genus, otiorhynchus, one, species, of, weevil, austroplatypus, incompertus, exhibits, eusociality, one, of, the, few, insects, outside, the, hymenoptera, and, the, isoptera, to, do, so, because, so, many, species, exist, in, such, diversity, the, higher, classification, of, weevils, is, in, a, state, of, flux, they, are, generally, divided, into, two, major, divisions, the, orthoceri, or, primitive, weevils, and, the, gonatoceri, or, true, weevils, curculionidae, e, c, zimmerman, proposed, a, third, division, the, heteromorphi, for, several, intermediate, forms, primitive, weevils, are, distinguished, by, having, straight, antennae, while, true, weevils, have, elbowed, geniculate, antennae, the, elbow, occurs, at, the, end, of, the, scape, first, antennal, segment, in, true, weevils, and, the, scape, is, usually, much, longer, than, the, other, antennal, segments, some, exceptions, occur, such, as, nanophyini, primitive, weevils, with, long, scapes, and, geniculate, antennae, while, among, the, true, weevils, gonipterinae, and, ramphus, have, short, scapes, and, little, or, no, elbow, a, 1995, classification, system, to, family, level, was, provided, by, kuschel, with, updates, from, marvaldi, et, al, in, 2002, and, was, achieved, using, phylogenetic, analyses, the, accepted, families, were, the, primitive, weevils, anthribidae, attelabidae, belidae, brentidae, caridae, and, nemonychidae, and, the, true, weevils, curculionidae, most, other, weevil, families, were, demoted, to, subfamilies, or, tribes, further, work, resulted, in, the, elevation, of, cimberididae, to, family, from, placement, as, a, subfamily, of, nemonychidae, in, 2017, and, the, recognition, of, the, cretaceous, age, family, mesophyletidae, in, 2018, from, burmese, amber, the, oldest, weevils, date, to, the, middle, late, jurassic, boundary, found, in, the, karabastau, formation, of, kazakhstan, the, shar, teg, locality, of, mongolia, the, daohugou, locality, in, inner, mongolia, china, and, the, talbragar, site, in, australia, the, extinct, family, obrieniidae, with, species, dating, from, the, ladinian, stage, of, the, triassic, through, to, tentatively, the, oxfordian, have, sometimes, been, considered, weevils, genera, of, the, family, have, only, been, found, in, three, formations, in, kazakhstan, with, most, named, in, 1993, however, their, phylogenetic, position, is, contested, with, others, considering, it, part, of, archostemata, the, interfamilial, relationships, of, curculionoidea, have, been, generally, well, resolved, the, phylogeny, by, li, et, al, 2023, based, on, phylogenomic, data, is, suggested, below, cimberididae, nemonychidae, anthribidae, belidae, attelabidae, caridae, brentidae, curculionidae, rhopalapion, longirostre, exhibits, an, extreme, case, of, sexual, dimorphism, the, female, rostrum, is, twice, as, long, and, its, surface, is, smoother, than, in, the, male, the, female, bores, egg, channels, into, the, buds, of, alcea, rosea, thus, the, dimorphism, is, not, attributed, to, sexual, selection, it, is, a, response, to, ecological, demands, of, egg, deposition, another, example, of, extreme, dimorphism, in, weevils, is, that, of, the, new, zealand, giraffe, weevil, males, measure, up, to, 90, mm, 3, 5, in, and, females, 50, mm, 2, 0, in, although, there, is, an, extreme, range, of, body, sizes, in, both, sexes
