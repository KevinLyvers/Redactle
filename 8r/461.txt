actinopterygii, k, t, n, p, t, r, d, i, a, from, actino, having, rays, and, ancient, greek, pt, rux, wing, fins, members, of, which, are, known, as, ray, finned, fish, or, actinopterygians, is, a, class, of, bony, fish, that, comprise, over, 50, of, living, vertebrate, species, they, are, so, called, because, of, their, lightly, built, fins, made, of, webbings, of, skin, supported, by, radially, extended, thin, bony, spines, called, lepidotrichia, as, opposed, to, the, bulkier, fleshy, lobed, fins, of, the, sister, class, sarcopterygii, lobe, finned, fish, resembling, folding, fans, the, actinopterygian, fins, can, easily, change, shape, and, wetted, area, providing, superior, thrust, to, weight, ratios, per, movement, compared, to, sarcopterygian, and, chondrichthyian, fins, the, fin, rays, attach, directly, to, the, proximal, or, basal, skeletal, elements, the, radials, which, represent, the, articulation, between, these, fins, and, the, internal, skeleton, e, g, pelvic, and, pectoral, girdles, the, vast, majority, of, actinopterygians, are, teleosts, by, species, count, they, dominate, the, subphylum, vertebrata, and, constitute, nearly, 99, of, the, over, 30, 000, extant, species, of, fish, they, are, the, most, abundant, nektonic, aquatic, animals, and, are, ubiquitous, throughout, freshwater, and, marine, environments, from, the, deep, sea, to, subterranean, waters, to, the, highest, mountain, streams, extant, species, can, range, in, size, from, paedocypris, at, 8, mm, 0, 3, in, to, the, massive, ocean, sunfish, at, 2, 300, kg, 5, 070, lb, and, to, the, giant, oarfish, at, 11, m, 36, ft, the, largest, ever, known, ray, finned, fish, the, extinct, leedsichthys, from, the, jurassic, has, been, estimated, to, have, grown, to, 16, 5, m, 54, ft, ray, finned, fishes, occur, in, many, variant, forms, the, main, features, of, typical, ray, finned, fish, are, shown, in, the, adjacent, diagram, the, swim, bladder, is, a, more, derived, structure, and, used, for, buoyancy, except, from, the, bichirs, which, just, like, the, lungs, of, lobe, finned, fish, have, retained, the, ancestral, condition, of, ventral, budding, from, the, foregut, the, swim, bladder, in, ray, finned, fishes, derives, from, a, dorsal, bud, above, the, foregut, in, early, forms, the, swim, bladder, could, still, be, used, for, breathing, a, trait, still, present, in, holostei, bowfins, and, gars, in, some, fish, like, the, arapaima, the, swim, bladder, has, been, modified, for, breathing, air, again, and, in, other, lineages, it, have, been, completely, lost, ray, finned, fishes, have, many, different, types, of, scales, but, all, teleosts, have, leptoid, scales, the, outer, part, of, these, scales, fan, out, with, bony, ridges, while, the, inner, part, is, crossed, with, fibrous, connective, tissue, leptoid, scales, are, thinner, and, more, transparent, than, other, types, of, scales, and, lack, the, hardened, enamel, or, dentine, like, layers, found, in, the, scales, of, many, other, fish, unlike, ganoid, scales, which, are, found, in, non, teleost, actinopterygians, new, scales, are, added, in, concentric, layers, as, the, fish, grows, teleosts, and, chondrosteans, sturgeons, and, paddlefish, also, differ, from, the, bichirs, and, holosteans, bowfin, and, gars, in, having, gone, through, a, whole, genome, duplication, paleopolyploidy, the, wgd, is, estimated, to, have, happened, about, 320, million, years, ago, in, the, teleosts, which, on, average, has, retained, about, 17, of, the, gene, duplicates, and, around, 180, 124, 225, million, years, ago, in, the, chondrosteans, it, has, since, happened, again, in, some, teleost, lineages, like, salmonidae, 80, 100, million, years, ago, and, several, times, independently, within, the, cyprinidae, in, goldfish, and, common, carp, as, recently, as, 14, million, years, ago, ray, finned, fish, vary, in, size, and, shape, in, their, feeding, specializations, and, in, the, number, and, arrangement, of, their, ray, fins, in, nearly, all, ray, finned, fish, the, sexes, are, separate, and, in, most, species, the, females, spawn, eggs, that, are, fertilized, externally, typically, with, the, male, inseminating, the, eggs, after, they, are, laid, development, then, proceeds, with, a, free, swimming, larval, stage, however, other, patterns, of, ontogeny, exist, with, one, of, the, commonest, being, sequential, hermaphroditism, in, most, cases, this, involves, protogyny, fish, starting, life, as, females, and, converting, to, males, at, some, stage, triggered, by, some, internal, or, external, factor, protandry, where, a, fish, converts, from, male, to, female, is, much, less, common, than, protogyny, most, families, use, external, rather, than, internal, fertilization, of, the, oviparous, teleosts, most, 79, do, not, provide, parental, care, viviparity, ovoviviparity, or, some, form, of, parental, care, for, eggs, whether, by, the, male, the, female, or, both, parents, is, seen, in, a, significant, fraction, 21, of, the, 422, teleost, families, no, care, is, likely, the, ancestral, condition, the, oldest, case, of, viviparity, in, ray, finned, fish, is, found, in, middle, triassic, species, of, saurichthys, viviparity, is, relatively, rare, and, is, found, in, about, 6, of, living, teleost, species, male, care, is, far, more, common, than, female, care, male, territoriality, preadapts, a, species, for, evolving, male, parental, care, there, are, a, few, examples, of, fish, that, self, fertilise, the, mangrove, rivulus, is, an, amphibious, simultaneous, hermaphrodite, producing, both, eggs, and, spawn, and, having, internal, fertilisation, this, mode, of, reproduction, may, be, related, to, the, fish, s, habit, of, spending, long, periods, out, of, water, in, the, mangrove, forests, it, inhabits, males, are, occasionally, produced, at, temperatures, below, 19, c, 66, f, and, can, fertilise, eggs, that, are, then, spawned, by, the, female, this, maintains, genetic, variability, in, a, species, that, is, otherwise, highly, inbred, actinopterygii, is, divided, into, the, classes, cladistia, and, actinopteri, the, latter, comprises, the, subclasses, chondrostei, and, neopterygii, the, neopterygii, in, turn, is, divided, into, the, infraclasses, holostei, and, teleostei, during, the, mesozoic, triassic, jurassic, cretaceous, and, cenozoic, the, teleosts, in, particular, diversified, widely, as, a, result, 96, of, living, fish, species, are, teleosts, 40, of, all, fish, species, belong, to, the, teleost, subgroup, acanthomorpha, while, all, other, groups, of, actinopterygians, represent, depauperate, lineages, the, classification, of, ray, finned, fishes, can, be, summarized, as, follows, the, cladogram, below, shows, the, main, clades, of, living, actinopterygians, and, their, evolutionary, relationships, to, other, extant, groups, of, fishes, and, the, four, limbed, vertebrates, tetrapods, the, latter, include, mostly, terrestrial, species, but, also, groups, that, became, secondarily, aquatic, e, g, whales, and, dolphins, tetrapods, evolved, from, a, group, of, bony, fish, during, the, devonian, period, approximate, divergence, dates, for, the, different, actinopterygian, clades, in, millions, of, years, mya, are, from, near, et, al, 2012, jaw, less, fishes, hagfish,
