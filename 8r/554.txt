crocodilia, or, crocodylia, both, k, r, k, d, l, i, is, an, order, of, semiaquatic, predatory, reptiles, known, as, crocodilians, they, first, appeared, during, the, late, cretaceous, and, are, the, closest, living, relatives, of, birds, crocodilians, are, a, type, of, crocodylomorph, pseudosuchian, a, subset, of, archosaurs, that, appeared, about, 235, million, years, ago, and, were, the, only, survivors, of, the, triassic, jurassic, extinction, event, the, order, includes, the, true, crocodiles, family, crocodylidae, the, alligators, and, caimans, family, alligatoridae, and, the, gharial, and, false, gharial, family, gavialidae, although, the, term, crocodiles, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, all, of, these, it, is, less, ambiguous, to, use, crocodilians, extant, crocodilians, have, long, flat, heads, with, long, snouts, and, tails, compressed, on, the, sides, with, their, eyes, ears, and, nostrils, at, the, top, of, the, head, they, are, good, swimmers, and, can, move, on, land, in, a, high, walk, position, traveling, with, their, legs, erect, rather, than, sprawling, crocodilians, have, thick, skin, covered, in, non, overlapping, scales, they, have, conical, peg, like, teeth, and, a, powerful, bite, like, birds, crocodilians, possess, a, four, chambered, heart, and, lungs, with, unidirectional, airflow, like, most, other, reptiles, they, are, ectotherms, crocodilians, are, found, mainly, in, lowlands, in, the, tropics, but, alligators, also, live, in, the, southeastern, united, states, and, the, yangtze, river, in, china, they, have, a, largely, carnivorous, diet, some, species, like, the, gharial, are, specialized, feeders, while, others, like, the, saltwater, crocodile, have, generalized, diets, crocodilians, are, generally, solitary, and, territorial, though, they, sometimes, hunt, in, groups, during, the, breeding, season, dominant, males, try, to, monopolize, available, females, females, lay, their, eggs, in, holes, or, mounds, and, similar, to, many, birds, care, for, their, hatched, young, some, species, of, crocodilians, particularly, the, nile, crocodile, are, known, to, have, attacked, humans, humans, are, the, greatest, threat, to, crocodilian, populations, through, activities, that, include, hunting, poaching, and, habitat, destruction, but, farming, of, crocodilians, has, greatly, reduced, unlawful, trading, in, wild, skins, artistic, and, literary, representations, of, crocodilians, have, appeared, in, human, cultures, around, the, world, since, ancient, egypt, crocodilia, and, crocodylia, have, been, used, interchangeably, for, decades, starting, with, schmidt, s, redescription, of, the, group, from, the, formerly, defunct, term, loricata, schmidt, used, the, older, term, crocodilia, based, on, owen, s, original, name, for, the, group, wermuth, opted, for, crocodylia, as, the, proper, name, basing, it, on, the, type, genus, crocodylus, laurenti, 1768, dundee, in, a, revision, of, many, reptilian, and, amphibian, names, argued, strongly, for, crocodylia, however, it, was, not, until, the, advent, of, cladistics, and, phylogenetic, nomenclature, that, a, more, solid, justification, for, one, spelling, over, the, other, was, proposed, prior, to, 1988, crocodilia, was, a, group, that, encompassed, the, modern, day, animals, as, well, as, their, more, distant, relatives, now, in, the, larger, groups, called, crocodylomorpha, and, pseudosuchia, under, its, current, definition, as, a, crown, group, as, opposed, to, a, stem, based, group, crocodylia, is, now, restricted, to, only, the, last, common, ancestor, of, today, s, modern, day, crocodilians, alligators, crocodiles, and, gharials, and, all, of, its, descendants, living, or, extinct, crocodilia, appears, to, be, a, latinizing, of, the, greek, crocodeilos, which, means, both, lizard, and, nile, crocodile, crocodylia, as, coined, by, wermuth, in, regards, to, the, genus, crocodylus, appears, to, be, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, kroke, meaning, shingle, or, pebble, and, or, dr, e, ilos, for, worm, the, name, may, refer, to, the, animal, s, habit, of, resting, on, the, pebbled, shores, of, the, nile, crocodilians, are, a, type, of, archosaur, a, clade, containing, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, of, crocodilians, birds, and, all, their, descendants, archosaurs, are, distinguished, from, other, reptiles, particularly, by, two, sets, of, extra, openings, in, the, skull, the, antorbital, fenestra, located, in, front, of, the, animal, s, eye, socket, and, the, mandibular, fenestra, in, the, middle, of, the, jaw, archosaurs, comprise, two, main, groups, the, pseudosuchia, crocodilians, and, their, relatives, and, the, avemetatarsalia, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and, their, relatives, the, split, between, these, two, is, assumed, to, have, happened, close, to, the, permian, triassic, extinction, event, informally, known, as, the, great, dying, during, the, early, triassic, pseudosuchians, flourished, and, diversified, one, form, the, crocodylomorphs, would, later, give, rise, to, modern, crocodilians, while, the, most, basal, crocodylomorphs, were, large, the, ones, that, gave, rise, to, crocodilians, were, small, gracile, and, leggy, this, evolutionary, grade, the, so, called, sphenosuchians, first, appeared, around, carnian, of, the, late, triassic, they, ate, small, fast, prey, and, survived, into, the, late, jurassic, as, the, triassic, ended, crocodylomorphs, became, the, only, surviving, pseudosuchians, during, the, early, jurassic, period, the, dinosaurs, became, dominant, on, land, and, the, crocodylomorphs, underwent, major, adaptive, diversifications, to, fill, ecological, niches, vacated, by, recently, extinguished, groups, mesozoic, crocodylomorphs, had, a, much, greater, diversity, of, forms, than, modern, crocodilians, some, became, small, fast, moving, insectivores, others, specialist, fish, eaters, still, others, marine, and, terrestrial, carnivores, and, a, few, became, herbivores, the, earliest, stage, of, crocodilian, evolution, was, the, protosuchians, in, the, late, triassic, and, early, jurassic, they, were, followed, by, the, mesosuchians, which, diversified, widely, during, the, jurassic, and, the, tertiary, the, eusuchians, first, appeared, during, the, early, cretaceous, and, includes, modern, crocodilians, protosuchians, were, small, mostly, terrestrial, animals, with, short, snouts, and, long, limbs, they, had, bony, armor, in, the, form, of, two, rows, of, plates, extending, from, head, to, tail, this, armor, is, retained, by, most, modern, crocodilians, their, vertebrae, were, convex, on, the, two, main, articulating, surfaces, and, their, bony, palates, were, little, developed, the, mesosuchians, saw, a, fusion, of, the, palatine, bones, to, form, a, secondary, bony, palate, and, a, great, extension, of, the, nasal, passages, to, near, the, pterygoid, bones, this, allowed, the, animal, to, breathe, through, its, nostrils, while, its, mouth, was, open, underwater, the, eusuchians, continued, this, process, with, the, interior, nostrils, now, opening, through, an, aperture, in, the, pterygoid, bones, the, vertebrae, of, eusuchians, had, one, convex, and, one, concave, articulating, surface, allowing, for, a, ball, and, socket, type, joint, between, the, vertebrae, bringing, greater, flexibility, and, strength, the, oldest, known, eusuchian, is, hylaeochampsa, vectiana, from, the, early, cretaceous, of, the, isle, of, wight, in, the, united, kingdom, it, was, followed, by, crocodilians, such, as, the, planocraniidae, the, so, called, hoofed, crocodiles, in, the, palaeogene, spanning, the, cretaceous, and, palaeogene, periods, is, the, genus, borealosuchus, of, north, america, with, six, species, though, its, phylogenetic, position, is, not, settled, the, three, primary, branches, of, crocodilia, had, diverged, by, the, late, cretaceous, the, possible, earliest, known, members, of, the, group, may, be, portugalosuchus, and, zholsuchus, from, the, cenomanian, turonian, stages, the, classification, of, portugalosuchus, has, been, disputed, by, some, researchers, who, claimed, that, it, may, be, outside, the, crown, group, crocodilians, the, morphology, based, phylogenetic, analyses, based, on, the, new, neuroanatomical, data, obtained, from, its, skull, using, micro, ct, scans, suggested, that, this, taxon, is, a, crown, group, crocodilian, and, a, member, of, the, thoracosaurs, recovered, as, a, sister, taxon, of, thoracosaurus, within, gavialoidea, though, it, is, uncertain, whether, thoracosaurs, were, true, gavialoids, definitive, alligatoroids, first, appeared, during, the, santonian, campanian, stages, while, definitive, longirostres, first, appeared, during, the, maastrichtian, stage, the, earliest, known, alligatoroids, and, gavialoids, include, highly, derived, forms, which, indicates, that, the, time, of, the, actual, divergence, between, the, three, lineages, must, have, been, a, pre, campanian, event, additionally, scientists, conclude, that, environmental, factors, played, a, major, role, in, the, evolution, of, crocodilians, and, their, ancestors, with, warmer, climate, being, associated, with, high, evolutionary, rates, and, large, body, sizes, crocodylia, is, cladistically, defined, as, the, last, common, ancestor, of, gavialis, gangeticus, the, gharial, alligator, mississippiensis, american, alligator, and, crocodylus, rhombifer, the, cuban, crocodile, and, all, of, its, descendants, the, phylogenetic, relationships, of, crocodilians, has, been, the, subject, of, debate, and, conflicting, results, many, studies, and, their, resulting, cladograms, or, family, trees, of, crocodilians, have, found, the, short, snouted, families, of, crocodylidae, and, alligatoridae, to, be, close, relatives, with, the, long, snouted, gavialidae, as, a, divergent, branch, of, the, tree, the, resulting, group, of, short, snouted, species, named, brevirostres, was, supported, mainly, by, morphological, studies, which, analyzed, skeletal, features, alone, however, recent, molecular, studies, using, dna, sequencing, of, living, crocodilians, have, rejected, this, distinct, group, brevirostres, with, the, long, snouted, gavialids, more, closely, related, to, crocodiles, than, to, alligators, with, the, new, grouping, of, gavialids, and, crocodiles, named, longirostres, below, is, a, cladogram, from, 2021, showing, the, relationships, of, the, major, extant, crocodilian, groups, this, analysis, was, based, off, mitochondrial, dna, including, that, of, the, recently, extinct, voay, robustus, caiman, melanosuchus, paleosuchus, alligator, crocodylus, voay, mecistops, osteolaemus, gavialis, tomistoma, crocodilians, range, in, size, from, the, paleosuchus, and, osteolaemus, species, which, reach, 1, 1, 5, m, 3, ft, 3, in, 4, ft, 11, in, to, the, saltwater, crocodile, which, reaches, 7, m, 23, ft, and, weighs, up, to, 2, 000, kg, 4, 400, lb, though, some, prehistoric, species, such, as, the, late, cretaceous, deinosuchus, were, even, larger, at, up, to, about, 11, m, 36, ft, and, 3, 450, kg, 7, 610, lb, they, tend, to, be, sexually, dimorphic, with, males, much, larger, than, females, though, there, is, diversity, in, snout, and, tooth, shape, all, crocodilian, species, have, essentially, the, same, body, morphology, they, have, solidly, built, lizard, like, bodies, with, flat, heads, long, snouts, and, tails, compressed, from, side, to, side, their, limbs, are, reduced, in, size, the, front, feet, have, five, mostly, non, webbed, digits, and, the, hind, feet, have, four, webbed, digits, and, an, extra, fifth, the, skeleton, has, a, normal, build, for, among, both, tetrapods, and, archosaurs, although, the, skull, pelvis, and, ribs, are, modified, in, particular, the, cartilaginous, processes, of, the, ribs, allow, the, thorax, to, collapse, during, diving, and, the, structure, of, the, pelvis, can, accommodate, large, masses, of, food, or, more, air, in, the, lungs, both, sexes, have, a, cloaca, a, single, chamber, and, outlet, near, the, tail, into, which, the, intestinal, urinary, and, genital, tracts, open, it, houses, the, penis, in, males, and, the, clitoris, in, females, the, crocodilian, penis, is, permanently, erect, and, relies, on, cloacal, muscles, for, eversion, and, elastic, ligaments, and, a, tendon, for, recoil, the, gonads, are, located, near, the, kidneys, crocodilians, are, excellent, swimmers, during, aquatic, locomotion, the, muscular, tail, undulates, from, side, to, side, to, drive, the, animal, through, the, water, while, the, limbs, are, held, close, to, the, body, to, reduce, drag, when, the, animal, needs, to, stop, or, steer, in, a, different, direction, the, limbs, are, splayed, out, crocodilians, generally, cruise, slowly, on, the, surface, or, underwater, with, gentle, sinuous, movements, of, the, tail, but, when, pursued, or, chasing, prey, they, can, move, rapidly, crocodilians, are, less, well, adapted, for, moving, on, land, and, are, unusual, among, vertebrates, in, having, two, different, means, of, terrestrial, locomotion, the, high, walk, and, the, low, walk, their, ankle, joints, flex, in, a, different, way, from, those, of, other, reptiles, a, feature, they, share, with, some, early, archosaurs, one, of, the, upper, row, of, ankle, bones, the, astragalus, moves, with, the, tibia, and, fibula, the, other, the, calcaneum, is, functionally, part, of, the, foot, and, has, a, socket, into, which, a, peg, from, the, astragalus, fits, the, result, is, that, the, legs, can, be, held, almost, vertically, beneath, the, body, when, on, land, and, the, foot, can, swivel, during, locomotion, with, a, twisting, movement, at, the, ankle, the, high, walk, of, crocodilians, with, the, belly, and, most, of, the, tail, held, off, the, ground, is, unique, among, living, reptiles, it, somewhat, resembles, the, walk, of, a, mammal, with, the, same, sequence, of, limb, movements, left, fore, right, hind, right, fore, left, hind, the, low, walk, is, similar, to, the, high, walk, but, without, the, body, being, raised, and, is, quite, different, from, the, sprawling, walk, of, salamanders, and, lizards, the, animal, can, change, from, one, walk, to, the, other, instantaneously, but, the, high, walk, is, the, usual, means, of, locomotion, on, land, the, animal, may, push, its, body, up, and, use, this, form, immediately, or, may, take, one, or, two, strides, of, low, walk, before, raising, the, body, higher, unlike, most, other, land, vertebrates, when, crocodilians, increase, their, pace, of, travel, they, increase, the, speed, at, which, the, lower, half, of, each, limb, rather, than, the, whole, leg, swings, forward, so, stride, length, increases, while, stride, duration, decreases, though, typically, slow, on, land, crocodilians, can, produce, brief, bursts, of, speed, and, some, can, run, at, 12, to, 14, km, h, 7, 5, to, 8, 7, mph, for, short, distances, a, fast, entry, into, water, from, a, muddy, bank, can, be, effected, by, plunging, to, the, ground, twisting, the, body, from, side, to, side, and, splaying, out, the, limbs, in, some, small, species, such, as, the, freshwater, crocodile, a, running, gait, can, progress, to, a, bounding, gallop, this, involves, the, hind, limbs, launching, the, body, forward, and, the, fore, limbs, subsequently, taking, the, weight, next, the, hind, limbs, swing, forward, as, the, spine, flexes, dorso, ventrally, and, this, sequence, of, movements, is, repeated, during, terrestrial, locomotion, a, crocodilian, can, keep, its, back, and, tail, straight, since, the, scales, are, attached, to, the, vertebrae, by, muscles, whether, on, land, or, in, water, crocodilians, can, jump, or, leap, by, pressing, their, tails, and, hind, limbs, against, the, substrate, and, launching, themselves, into, the, air, the, snout, shape, of, crocodilians, varies, between, species, alligators, and, caimans, tend, to, have, wider, snouts, while, those, of, crocodiles, may, be, more, slender, and, the, gharial, s, are, the, most, slender, the, muscles, that, close, the, jaws, are, larger, and, more, powerful, than, the, ones, that, open, them, and, a, crocodilian, s, jaws, can, be, held, shut, by, a, person, fairly, easily, conversely, the, jaws, are, extremely, difficult, to, pry, open, the, powerful, closing, muscles, attach, at, the, median, portion, of, the, lower, jaw, and, the, jaw, hinge, attaches, to, the, atlanto, occipital, joint, allowing, the, animal, to, open, its, mouth, fairly, wide, the, tongue, cannot, move, freely, but, is, held, in, place, by, a, folded, membrane, crocodilians, have, some, of, the, strongest, bite, forces, in, the, animal, kingdom, in, a, study, published, in, 2003, an, american, alligator, s, bite, force, was, measured, at, up, to, 2, 125, lbf, 9, 45, kn, in, a, 2012, study, a, saltwater, crocodile, s, bite, force, was, measured, even, higher, at, 3, 700, lbf, 16, kn, this, study, also, found, no, correlation, between, bite, force, and, snout, shape, nevertheless, the, gharial, s, extremely, slender, jaws, are, relatively, weak, and, built, more, for, quick, jaw, closure, the, bite, force, of, deinosuchus, may, have, measured, 23, 000, lbf, 100, kn, even, greater, than, that, of, theropod, dinosaurs, like, tyrannosaurus, crocodilian, teeth, vary, from, blunt, and, dull, to, sharp, and, needle, like, broad, snouted, species, have, teeth, that, vary, in, size, while, those, of, slender, snouted, species, are, more, consistent, the, teeth, of, crocodiles, and, gharials, tend, to, be, more, visible, than, those, of, alligators, and, caimans, when, the, jaws, are, closed, the, easiest, way, to, distinguish, crocodiles, from, alligators, is, by, looking, at, their, jaw, line, the, teeth, on, the, lower, jaw, of, an, alligator, fit, into, sockets, in, the, upper, jaw, so, only, the, upper, teeth, are, visible, when, the, mouth, is, closed, the, teeth, on, the, lower, jaw, of, a, crocodile, fit, into, grooves, on, the, outside, of, the, top, jaw, making, both, the, upper, and, lower, teeth, visible, when, the, mouth, is, closed, crocodilians, are, homodonts, meaning, each, of, their, teeth, are, all, of, the, same, type, they, do, not, possess, different, tooth, types, such, as, canines, and, molars, and, polyphyodonts, are, able, to, replace, each, of, their, approximately, 80, teeth, up, to, 50, times, in, their, 35, to, 75, year, lifespan, they, are, the, only, non, mammalian, vertebrates, with, tooth, sockets, next, to, each, full, grown, tooth, there, is, a, small, replacement, tooth, and, an, odontogenic, stem, cell, in, the, dental, lamina, which, can, be, activated, when, required, tooth, replacement, slows, and, eventually, stops, as, the, animal, ages, the, eyes, ears, and, nostrils, of, crocodilians, are, at, the, top, of, the, head, this, allows, them, to, stalk, their, prey, with, most, of, their, bodies, underwater, crocodilians, appear, to, have, gone, through, a, nocturnal, bottleneck, early, in, their, history, where, they, became, dichromatic, red, green, colorblindness, and, their, eyes, lost, features, like, sclerotic, rings, an, annular, pad, of, the, lens, and, colored, cone, oil, droplets, since, them, some, crocodilians, appears, to, have, re, evolved, a, trichromatic, color, vision, while, eyesight, is, fairly, good, in, air, it, is, significantly, weakened, underwater, when, in, bright, light, the, pupils, of, a, crocodilian, contract, into, narrow, slits, whereas, in, darkness, they, become, large, circles, this, is, typical, for, animals, that, hunt, at, night, crocodilians, also, possess, a, tapetum, lucidum, which, enhances, vision, in, low, light, when, the, animal, completely, submerges, the, nictitating, membranes, cover, its, eyes, in, addition, glands, on, the, nictitating, membrane, secrete, a, salty, lubricant, that, keeps, the, eye, clean, when, a, crocodilian, leaves, the, water, and, dries, off, this, substance, is, visible, as, tears, the, ears, are, adapted, for, hearing, both, in, air, and, underwater, and, the, eardrums, are, protected, by, flaps, that, can, be, opened, or, closed, by, muscles, crocodilians, have, a, wide, hearing, range, with, sensitivity, comparable, to, most, birds, and, many, mammals, the, well, developed, trigeminal, nerve, allows, them, to, detect, vibrations, in, the, water, such, as, those, made, by, potential, prey, crocodilians, have, only, one, olfactory, chamber, and, the, vomeronasal, organ, is, absent, in, the, adults, indicating, all, olfactory, perception, is, limited, to, the, olfactory, system, behavioural, and, olfactometer, experiments, indicate, that, crocodiles, detect, both, air, borne, and, water, soluble, chemicals, and, use, their, olfactory, system, for, hunting, when, above, water, crocodiles, enhance, their, ability, to, detect, volatile, odorants, by, gular, pumping, a, rhythmic, movement, of, the, floor, of, the, pharynx, they, appear, to, have, lost, their, pineal, organ, but, still, show, signs, of, melatonin, rhythms, the, skin, of, crocodilians, is, thick, and, cornified, and, is, clad, in, non, overlapping, scales, known, as, scutes, arranged, in, regular, rows, and, patterns, these, scales, are, continually, being, produced, by, cell, division, in, the, underlying, layer, of, the, epidermis, the, stratum, germinativum, and, the, surface, of, individual, scutes, sloughs, off, periodically, the, outer, surface, of, the, scutes, consists, of, the, relatively, rigid, beta, keratin, while, the, hinge, region, between, the, scutes, contains, only, the, more, pliable, alpha, keratin, many, of, the, scutes, are, strengthened, by, bony, plates, known, as, osteoderms, they, are, most, numerous, on, the, back, and, neck, of, the, animal, and, often, have, prominent, lumpy, ridges, and, are, covered, in, durable, beta, keratin, the, belly, and, underside, of, the, tail, possess, rows, of, broad, flat, and, square, shaped, scales, both, the, head, and, jaws, lack, actual, scales, and, are, instead, covered, in, tight, keratinised, skin, that, is, fused, directory, to, the, bones, of, the, skull, and, which, over, time, develop, a, pattern, of, cracks, as, the, skull, develops, the, skin, on, the, neck, and, sides, is, loose, the, scutes, contain, blood, vessels, and, may, act, to, absorb, or, release, heat, during, thermoregulation, research, also, suggests, that, alkaline, ions, released, into, the, blood, from, the, calcium, and, magnesium, in, these, dermal, bones, act, as, a, buffer, during, prolonged, submersion, when, increasing, levels, of, carbon, dioxide, would, otherwise, cause, acidosis, some, scutes, contain, a, single, pore, known, as, an, integumentary, sense, organ, crocodiles, and, gharials, have, these, on, large, parts, of, their, bodies, while, alligators, and, caimans, only, have, them, on, the, head, their, exact, function, is, not, fully, understood, but, it, has, been, suggested, that, they, may, be, mechanosensory, organs, there, are, prominent, paired, integumentary, glands, in, skin, folds, on, the, throat, and, others, in, the, side, walls, of, the, cloaca, various, functions, for, these, have, been, suggested, they, may, play, a, part, in, communication, as, indirect, evidence, suggest, that, they, secrete, pheromones, used, in, courtship, or, nesting, the, skin, of, crocodilians, is, tough, and, can, withstand, damage, from, conspecifics, and, the, immune, system, is, effective, enough, to, heal, wounds, within, a, few, days, in, the, genus, crocodylus, the, skin, contains, chromatophores, allowing, them, to, change, color, from, dark, to, light, and, vice, versa, the, crocodilian, has, perhaps, the, most, complex, vertebrate, circulatory, system, it, has, a, four, chambered, heart, and, two, ventricles, an, unusual, trait, among, extant, reptiles, and, both, a, left, and, right, aorta, which, are, connected, by, a, hole, called, the, foramen, of, panizza, like, birds, and, mammals, crocodilians, have, heart, valves, that, direct, blood, flow, in, a, single, direction, through, the, heart, chambers, they, also, have, unique, cog, teeth, like, valves, that, when, interlocked, direct, blood, to, the, left, aorta, and, away, from, the, lungs, and, then, back, around, the, body, this, system, may, allow, the, animals, to, remain, submerged, for, a, longer, period, but, this, explanation, has, been, questioned, other, possible, reasons, for, the, peculiar, circulatory, system, include, assistance, with, thermoregulatory, needs, prevention, of, pulmonary, oedema, or, faster, recovery, from, metabolic, acidosis, retaining, carbon, dioxide, within, the, body, permits, an, increase, in, the, rate, of, gastric, acid, secretion, and, thus, the, efficiency, of, digestion, and, other, gastrointestinal, organs, such, as, the, pancreas, spleen, small, intestine, and, liver, also, function, more, efficiently, when, submerged, a, crocodilian, s, heart, may, beat, at, only, one, or, two, beats, a, minute, with, little, blood, flow, to, the, muscle, when, it, rises, and, takes, a, breath, its, heart, rate, almost, immediately, speeds, up, and, the, muscles, receive, newly, oxygenated, blood, unlike, many, marine, mammals, crocodilians, have, little, myoglobin, to, store, oxygen, in, their, muscles, during, diving, an, increasing, concentration, of, bicarbonate, ions, causes, haemoglobin, in, the, blood, to, release, oxygen, for, the, muscles, crocodilians, were, traditionally, thought, to, breathe, like, mammals, with, airflow, moving, in, and, out, tidally, but, studies, published, in, 2010, and, 2013, conclude, that, crocodilians, breathe, more, like, birds, with, airflow, moving, in, a, unidirectional, loop, within, the, lungs, when, a, crocodilian, inhales, air, flows, through, the, trachea, and, into, two, primary, bronchi, or, airways, which, branch, off, into, narrower, secondary, passageways, the, air, continues, to, move, through, these, then, into, even, narrower, tertiary, airways, and, then, into, other, secondary, airways, which, were, bypassed, the, first, time, the, air, then, flows, back, into, the, primary, airways, and, is, exhaled, these, aerodynamic, valves, within, the, bronchial, tree, have, been, hypothesised, to, explain, how, crocodilians, can, have, unidirectional, airflow, without, the, aid, of, avian, like, air, sacs, the, lungs, of, crocodilians, are, attached, to, the, liver, and, the, pelvis, by, the, diaphragmaticus, muscle, analogous, of, the, diaphragm, in, mammals, during, inhalation, the, external, intercostal, muscles, expand, the, ribs, allowing, the, animal, to, take, in, more, air, while, the, ischiopubis, muscle, causes, the, hips, to, swing, downwards, and, push, the, belly, outward, and, the, diaphragmaticus, pulls, the, liver, back, when, exhaling, the, internal, intercostal, muscles, push, the, ribs, inward, while, the, rectus, abdominis, pulls, the, hips, and, liver, forwards, and, the, belly, inward, because, the, lungs, expand, into, the, space, formerly, occupied, by, the, liver, and, are, compressed, when, it, moves, back, into, position, this, motion, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, hepatic, piston, crocodilians, can, also, use, these, muscles, to, adjust, the, position, of, their, lungs, controlling, their, buoyancy, in, the, water, an, animal, sinks, when, the, lungs, are, pulled, towards, the, tail, and, floats, when, they, move, back, towards, the, head, this, allows, them, to, move, through, the, water, without, creating, disturbances, that, could, alert, potential, prey, they, can, also, spin, and, twist, by, moving, their, lungs, laterally, swimming, and, diving, crocodilians, appear, to, rely, on, lung, volume, more, for, buoyancy, than, oxygen, storage, just, before, diving, the, animal, exhales, to, reduce, its, lung, volume, and, achieve, negative, buoyancy, when, diving, the, nostrils, of, a, crocodilian, shut, tight, all, species, have, a, palatal, valve, a, membranous, flap, of, skin, at, the, back, of, the, oral, cavity, that, protects, the, oesophagus, and, trachea, when, the, animal, is, underwater, this, enables, them, to, open, their, mouths, underwater, without, drowning, crocodilians, typically, remain, underwater, for, fifteen, minutes, or, less, at, a, time, but, some, can, hold, their, breath, for, up, to, two, hours, under, ideal, conditions, the, maximum, diving, depth, is, unknown, but, crocodiles, can, dive, to, at, least, 20, m, 66, ft, vocalizing, is, produced, by, vibrating, vocal, folds, in, the, larynx, the, folds, of, the, american, alligator, have, a, complex, morphology, consisting, of, epithelium, lamina, propria, and, muscle, and, according, to, riede, et, al, 2015, it, is, reasonable, to, expect, species, specific, morphologies, in, vocal, folds, analogues, as, far, back, as, basal, reptiles, crocodilian, vocal, folds, lack, the, elasticity, of, mammalian, ones, but, the, larynx, is, still, capable, of, complex, motor, control, similar, to, birds, and, mammals, and, can, adequately, control, its, fundamental, frequency, crocodilian, teeth, are, adapted, for, seizing, and, holding, prey, and, food, is, swallowed, unchewed, the, digestive, tract, is, relatively, short, as, meat, is, fairly, simple, to, digest, the, stomach, is, divided, into, two, parts, a, muscular, gizzard, that, grinds, food, and, a, digestive, chamber, where, enzymes, work, on, it, indigestible, items, are, regurgitated, as, pellets, the, stomach, is, more, acidic, than, that, of, any, other, vertebrate, and, contains, ridges, for, gastroliths, which, play, a, role, in, the, crushing, of, food, digestion, takes, place, more, quickly, at, higher, temperatures, when, digesting, a, meal, co2, rich, blood, towards, the, lungs, is, redirected, to, the, stomach, where, glands, make, use, of, the, co2, to, form, bicarbonate, and, gastric, acid, secretions, approximately, 10, times, the, highest, rates, measured, in, mammals, alligators, have, a, higher, ability, to, digest, carbohydrates, relative, to, protein, compared, to, crocodiles, crocodilians, have, a, very, low, metabolic, rate, and, consequently, low, energy, requirements, this, allows, them, to, survive, for, many, months, on, a, single, large, meal, digesting, the, food, slowly, they, can, withstand, extended, fasting, living, on, stored, fat, between, meals, even, recently, hatched, crocodiles, are, able, to, survive, 58, days, without, food, losing, 23, of, their, bodyweight, during, this, time, an, adult, crocodile, needs, between, a, tenth, and, a, fifth, of, the, amount, of, food, necessary, for, a, lion, of, the, same, weight, and, can, live, for, half, a, year, without, eating, crocodilians, are, ectotherms, producing, relatively, little, heat, internally, and, relying, on, external, sources, to, raise, their, body, temperatures, the, sun, s, heat, is, the, main, means, of, warming, for, any, crocodilian, while, immersion, in, water, may, either, raise, its, temperature, by, conduction, or, cool, the, animal, in, hot, weather, the, main, method, for, regulating, its, temperature, is, behavioural, for, example, an, alligator, in, temperate, regions, may, start, the, day, by, basking, in, the, sun, on, land, a, bulky, animal, it, warms, up, slowly, but, later, in, the, day, it, moves, into, the, water, still, exposing, its, dorsal, surface, to, the, sun, at, night, it, remains, submerged, and, its, temperature, slowly, falls, the, basking, period, is, extended, in, winter, and, reduced, in, summer, for, crocodiles, in, the, tropics, avoiding, overheating, is, generally, the, main, problem, they, may, bask, briefly, in, the, morning, but, then, move, into, the, shade, remaining, there, for, the, rest, of, the, day, or, submerge, themselves, in, water, to, keep, cool, gaping, with, the, mouth, can, provide, cooling, by, evaporation, from, the, mouth, lining, by, these, means, the, temperature, range, of, crocodilians, is, usually, maintained, between, 25, and, 35, c, 77, and, 95, f, and, mainly, stays, in, the, range, 30, to, 33, c, 86, to, 91, f, the, ranges, of, the, american, and, chinese, alligator, extend, into, regions, that, sometimes, experience, periods, of, frost, in, winter, being, ectothermic, the, internal, body, temperature, of, crocodilians, falls, as, the, temperature, drops, and, they, become, sluggish, they, may, become, more, active, on, warm, days, but, do, not, usually, feed, at, all, during, the, winter, in, cold, weather, they, remain, submerged, with, their, tails, in, deeper, less, cold, water, and, their, nostrils, just, projecting, through, the, surface, if, ice, forms, on, the, water, they, maintain, ice, free, breathing, holes, and, there, have, been, occasions, when, their, snouts, have, become, frozen, into, the, ice, temperature, sensing, probes, implanted, in, wild, american, alligators, have, found, that, their, core, body, temperatures, can, descend, to, around, 5, c, 41, f, but, as, long, as, they, remain, able, to, breathe, they, show, no, ill, effects, when, the, weather, warms, up, no, living, species, of, crocodilian, can, be, considered, truly, marine, although, the, saltwater, crocodile, and, the, american, crocodile, are, able, to, swim, out, to, sea, their, normal, habitats, are, river, mouths, estuaries, mangrove, swamps, and, hypersaline, lakes, though, several, extinct, species, have, had, marine, habitats, including, the, recently, extinct, ikanogavialis, papuensis, which, occurred, in, a, fully, marine, habitat, in, the, solomon, islands, coastlines, all, crocodilians, need, to, maintain, a, suitable, concentration, of, salt, in, body, fluids, osmoregulation, is, related, to, the, quantity, of, salts, and, water, exchanged, with, the, environment, intake, of, water, and, salts, takes, place, across, the, lining, of, the, mouth, when, water, is, drunk, incidentally, while, feeding, and, when, present, in, foods, water, is, lost, during, breathing, and, both, salts, and, water, are, lost, in, the, urine, and, faeces, through, the, skin, and, via, salt, excreting, glands, on, the, tongue, though, these, are, only, present, in, crocodiles, and, gharials, the, skin, is, a, largely, effective, barrier, to, both, water, and, ions, gaping, causes, water, loss, by, evaporation, from, the, lining, of, the, mouth, and, on, land, water, is, also, lost, through, the, skin, large, animals, are, better, able, to, maintain, homeostasis, at, times, of, osmotic, stress, than, smaller, ones, newly, hatched, crocodilians, are, much, less, tolerant, of, exposure, to, salt, water, than, are, older, juveniles, presumably, because, they, have, a, higher, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, the, kidneys, and, excretory, system, are, much, the, same, as, in, other, reptiles, but, crocodilians, do, not, have, a, bladder, in, fresh, water, the, osmolality, the, concentration, of, solutes, that, contribute, to, a, solution, s, osmotic, pressure, in, the, plasma, is, much, higher, than, it, is, in, the, surrounding, water, the, animals, are, well, hydrated, and, the, urine, in, the, cloaca, is, abundant, and, dilute, nitrogen, being, excreted, as, ammonium, bicarbonate, sodium, loss, is, low, and, mainly, takes, place, through, the, skin, in, freshwater, conditions, in, seawater, the, opposite, is, true, the, osmolality, in, the, plasma, is, lower, than, the, surrounding, water, which, is, dehydrating, for, the, animal, the, cloacal, urine, is, much, more, concentrated, white, and, opaque, with, the, nitrogenous, waste, being, mostly, excreted, as, insoluble, uric, acid, crocodilians, are, amphibious, reptiles, spending, part, of, their, time, in, water, and, part, on, land, the, last, surviving, fully, terrestrial, genus, mekosuchus, became, extinct, about, 3000, years, ago, after, humans, had, arrived, on, its, pacific, islands, making, the, extinction, possibly, anthropogenic, typically, they, are, creatures, of, the, tropics, the, main, exceptions, are, the, american, and, chinese, alligators, whose, ranges, consist, of, the, southeastern, united, states, and, the, yangtze, river, respectively, florida, in, the, united, states, is, the, only, place, that, crocodiles, and, alligators, live, side, by, side, most, crocodilians, live, in, the, lowlands, and, few, are, found, above, 1, 000, metres, 3, 300, ft, where, the, temperatures, are, typically, about, 5, c, 9, f, lower, than, at, the, coast, none, of, them, permanently, reside, in, the, sea, though, some, can, venture, into, it, and, several, species, can, tolerate, the, brackish, water, of, estuaries, mangrove, swamps, and, the, extreme, salinity, of, hypersaline, lakes, the, saltwater, crocodile, has, the, widest, distribution, of, any, crocodilian, with, a, range, extending, from, eastern, india, to, new, guinea, and, northern, australia, much, of, its, success, is, due, to, its, ability, to, swim, out, to, sea, and, colonise, new, locations, but, it, is, not, restricted, to, the, marine, environment, and, spends, much, time, in, estuaries, rivers, and, large, lakes, various, types, of, aquatic, habitats, are, used, by, different, crocodilians, some, species, are, relatively, more, terrestrial, and, prefer, swamps, ponds, and, the, edges, of, lakes, where, they, can, bask, in, the, sun, and, there, is, plenty, of, plant, life, supporting, a, diverse, fauna, others, spend, more, time, in, the, water, and, inhabit, the, lower, stretches, of, rivers, mangrove, swamps, and, estuaries, these, habitats, also, have, a, rich, flora, and, provide, plenty, of, food, the, asian, gharials, find, the, fish, on, which, they, feed, in, the, pools, and, backwaters, of, swift, rivers, south, american, dwarf, caimans, inhabit, cool, fast, flowing, streams, often, near, waterfalls, and, other, caimans, live, in, warmer, turbid, lakes, and, slow, moving, rivers, the, crocodiles, are, mainly, river, dwellers, and, the, chinese, alligator, is, found, in, slow, moving, turbid, rivers, flowing, across, china, s, floodplains, the, american, alligator, is, an, adaptable, species, and, inhabits, swamps, rivers, or, lakes, with, clear, or, turbid, water, climatic, factors, also, affect, crocodilians, distribution, locally, during, the, dry, season, caimans, can, be, restricted, to, deep, pools, in, rivers, for, several, months, in, the, rainy, season, much, of, the, savanna, in, the, orinoco, llanos, is, flooded, and, they, disperse, widely, across, the, plain, desert, crocodiles, in, mauritania, have, adapted, to, their, arid, environment, by, staying, in, caves, or, burrows, in, a, state, of, aestivation, during, the, driest, periods, when, it, rains, the, reptiles, gather, at, gueltas, dry, land, is, also, important, as, it, provides, opportunities, for, basking, nesting, and, escaping, from, temperature, extremes, gaping, allows, evaporation, of, moisture, from, the, mouth, lining, and, has, a, cooling, effect, and, several, species, make, use, of, shallow, burrows, on, land, to, keep, cool, wallowing, in, mud, can, also, help, prevent, them, from, overheating, four, species, of, crocodilians, climb, trees, to, bask, in, areas, lacking, a, shoreline, the, type, of, vegetation, bordering, the, rivers, and, lakes, inhabited, by, crocodilians, is, mostly, humid, tropical, forest, with, mangrove, swamps, in, estuarine, areas, these, forests, are, of, great, importance, to, the, crocodilians, creating, suitable, microhabitats, where, they, can, flourish, the, roots, of, the, trees, absorb, water, when, it, rains, releasing, it, back, slowly, into, the, environment, when, the, forests, are, cleared, to, make, way, for, agriculture, rivers, tend, to, silt, up, the, water, runs, off, rapidly, the, water, courses, can, dry, up, in, the, dry, season, and, flooding, can, occur, in, the, wet, season, destruction, of, forest, habitat, is, probably, a, greater, threat, to, crocodilians, than, hunting, being, highly, efficient, predators, crocodilians, tend, to, be, top, of, the, food, chain, in, their, watery, environments, the, nest, mounds, built, by, some, species, of, crocodilian, are, used, by, other, animals, for, their, own, purposes, american, alligator, mounds, are, used, by, turtles, and, snakes, both, for, basking, and, for, laying, their, own, eggs, the, florida, red, bellied, turtle, specialises, in, this, and, alligator, mounds, may, have, several, clutches, of, turtle, eggs, developing, alongside, the, owner, s, eggs, alligators, modify, some, wetland, habitats, in, flat, areas, such, as, the, everglades, by, constructing, small, ponds, known, as, alligator, holes, these, create, wetter, or, drier, habitats, for, other, organisms, such, as, plants, fish, invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, and, mammals, in, the, limestone, depressions, of, cypress, swamps, alligator, holes, tend, to, be, large, and, deep, those, in, marl, prairies, and, rocky, glades, are, usually, small, and, shallow, while, those, in, peat, depressions, of, ridge, and, slough, wetlands, are, more, variable, man, made, holes, do, not, appear, to, have, as, large, an, effect, in, the, amazon, basin, when, caimans, became, scarce, as, a, result, of, overhunting, in, the, mid, 20th, century, the, number, of, local, fish, such, as, the, important, arapaima, arapaima, gigas, also, decreased, these, are, nutrient, poor, waters, and, the, urine, and, faeces, of, the, caimans, may, have, increased, primary, production, by, contributing, plant, nutrients, thus, the, presence, of, the, reptiles, could, have, benefited, the, fish, stock, the, number, of, crocodilians, in, a, stretch, of, water, appears, to, be, correlated, with, the, fish, population, crocodilians, are, among, the, most, cognitively, complex, nonavian, reptiles, though, their, behavioral, repertoire, is, less, well, understood, than, other, vertebrates, due, to, the, difficulty, of, monitoring, solitary, and, often, nocturnal, predators, in, aquatic, habitats, embryological, studies, of, developing, amniotes, have, shown, similar, brain, structures, in, the, telencephalon, between, crocodilians, mammals, and, birds, accordingly, several, behaviors, once, thought, unique, to, mammals, and, birds, have, been, recently, discovered, in, crocodilians, some, crocodilian, species, have, been, observed, to, use, sticks, and, branches, to, lure, nest, building, birds, though, other, authors, have, argued, the, purpose, of, stick, displaying, is, ambiguous, at, best, several, species, have, been, observed, to, hunt, cooperatively, herding, and, chasing, prey, play, or, the, free, intrinsically, motivated, activity, by, young, individuals, has, been, observed, on, numerous, occasions, in, crocodilians, in, both, captive, and, wild, settings, with, young, alligators, and, crocodiles, regularly, engaging, in, object, play, and, social, play, as, with, their, mammalian, and, avian, counterparts, play, likely, performs, a, significant, role, in, helping, these, predators, to, hone, their, hunting, skills, and, develop, their, understanding, of, behavioral, tradeoffs, it, is, important, to, note, that, not, all, higher, social, behaviors, are, endemic, across, these, clades, a, 2023, study, of, tinamou, a, paleognath, avian, and, american, alligator, test, subjects, found, that, while, the, paleognaths, were, able, to, engage, in, visual, perspective, taking, a, cornerstone, of, advanced, social, cognition, the, alligators, did, not, appear, to, do, so, some, researchers, have, proposed, to, increase, the, use, of, crocodilians, as, test, animals, in, comparative, cognition, studies, adult, crocodilians, are, typically, territorial, and, solitary, individuals, may, guard, basking, spots, nesting, sites, feeding, areas, nurseries, and, overwintering, sites, male, saltwater, crocodiles, defend, areas, with, several, female, nesting, sites, year, round, some, species, are, occasionally, gregarious, particularly, during, droughts, when, several, individuals, gather, at, remaining, water, sites, individuals, of, some, species, may, share, basking, sites, at, certain, times, of, the, day, crocodilians, are, largely, carnivorous, and, the, diets, of, different, species, can, vary, with, snout, shape, and, tooth, sharpness, species, with, sharp, teeth, and, long, slender, snouts, like, the, indian, gharial, and, australian, freshwater, crocodile, are, specialised, for, feeding, on, fish, insects, and, crustaceans, while, extremely, broad, snouted, species, with, blunt, teeth, like, the, chinese, alligator, and, broad, snouted, caiman, specialise, in, eating, hard, shelled, molluscs, species, whose, snouts, and, teeth, are, intermediate, between, these, two, forms, such, as, the, saltwater, crocodile, and, american, alligator, have, generalised, diets, and, opportunistically, feed, on, invertebrates, fish, amphibians, other, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, though, mostly, carnivorous, several, species, of, crocodilian, have, been, observed, to, consume, fruit, and, this, may, play, a, role, in, seed, dispersal, in, general, crocodilians, are, stalk, and, ambush, predators, though, hunting, strategies, vary, depending, on, the, individual, species, and, the, prey, being, hunted, terrestrial, prey, is, stalked, from, the, water, s, edge, and, then, grabbed, and, drowned, gharials, and, other, fish, eating, species, sweep, their, jaws, sideways, to, snap, up, prey, and, these, animals, can, leap, out, of, the, water, to, catch, birds, bats, and, leaping, fish, a, small, animal, can, be, killed, by, whiplash, as, the, predator, shakes, its, head, when, foraging, for, fish, in, shallow, water, caiman, herd, then, with, their, tails, and, bodies, they, may, also, dig, for, bottom, dwelling, invertebrates, and, the, smooth, fronted, caiman, will, even, hunt, on, land, crocodilians, are, unable, to, chew, and, need, to, swallow, food, whole, so, prey, that, is, too, large, to, swallow, is, torn, into, pieces, they, may, be, unable, to, deal, with, a, large, animal, with, a, thick, hide, and, may, wait, until, it, becomes, putrid, and, comes, apart, more, easily, to, tear, a, chunk, of, tissue, from, a, large, carcass, a, crocodilian, spins, its, body, continuously, while, holding, on, with, its, jaws, a, maneuver, known, as, the, death, roll, during, cooperative, feeding, some, individuals, may, hold, on, to, the, prey, while, others, perform, the, roll, the, animals, do, not, fight, and, each, retires, with, a, piece, of, flesh, and, awaits, its, next, feeding, turn, after, feeding, together, individuals, may, go, their, separate, ways, food, is, typically, consumed, by, crocodilians, with, their, heads, above, water, the, food, is, held, with, the, tips, of, the, jaws, tossed, towards, the, back, of, the, mouth, by, an, upward, jerk, of, the, head, and, then, gulped, down, nile, crocodiles, may, cache, kills, underwater, for, later, consumption, crocodilians, are, generally, polygynous, and, individual, males, try, to, mate, with, as, many, females, as, they, can, monogamous, pairings, have, been, recorded, in, american, alligators, and, parthenogenesis, has, been, observed, in, the, american, crocodile, dominant, male, crocodilians, patrol, and, defend, territories, which, contain, several, females, males, of, some, species, like, the, american, alligator, try, to, attract, females, with, elaborate, courtship, displays, during, courtship, crocodilian, males, and, females, may, rub, against, each, other, circle, around, and, perform, swimming, displays, copulation, typically, occurs, in, the, water, when, a, female, is, ready, to, mate, she, arches, her, back, while, her, head, and, tail, dip, underwater, the, male, rubs, across, the, female, s, neck, and, then, grasps, her, with, his, hindlimbs, placing, his, tail, underneath, hers, so, their, cloacas, align, and, his, penis, can, be, inserted, intermission, can, last, up, to, 15, minutes, during, which, time, the, pair, continuously, submerge, and, surface, while, dominant, males, usually, monopolise, females, single, american, alligator, clutches, can, be, sired, by, three, different, males, depending, on, the, species, female, crocodilians, may, construct, either, holes, or, mounds, as, nests, the, latter, made, from, vegetation, litter, sand, or, soil, nests, are, typically, found, near, dens, or, caves, those, made, by, different, females, are, sometimes, close, to, each, other, particularly, in, hole, nesting, species, the, number, of, eggs, laid, in, a, single, clutch, ranges, from, ten, to, fifty, crocodilian, eggs, are, protected, by, hard, shells, made, of, calcium, carbonate, the, incubation, period, is, two, to, three, months, the, sex, of, the, developing, incubating, young, is, temperature, dependant, constant, nest, temperatures, above, 32, c, 90, f, produce, more, males, while, those, below, 31, c, 88, f, produce, more, females, however, sex, in, crocodilians, may, be, established, in, a, short, period, of, time, and, nests, are, subject, to, changes, in, temperature, most, natural, nests, produce, hatchlings, of, both, sexes, though, single, sex, clutches, do, occur, the, young, may, all, hatch, in, a, single, night, crocodilians, are, unusual, among, reptiles, in, the, amount, of, parental, care, provided, after, the, young, hatch, the, mother, helps, excavate, hatchlings, from, the, nest, and, carries, them, to, water, in, her, mouth, newly, hatched, crocodilians, gather, together, and, follow, their, mother, both, male,

guinea, crocodiles, and, siamese, crocodiles, roar, when, approached, by, another, adult, while, nile, crocodiles, grunt, or, bellow, in, a, similar, situation, the, american, alligator, is, exceptionally, noisy, it, emits, a, series, of, about, seven, throaty, bellows, each, a, couple, of, seconds, long, at, ten, second, intervals, it, also, makes, various, grunts, and, hisses, males, create, vibrations, in, the, water, to, send, out, infrasonic, signals, that, serve, to, attract, females, and, intimidate, rivals, when, individuals, bellow, at, the, water, s, surface, the, infrasound, disturbs, the, water, in, nonrandom, but, visually, appealing, patterns, leading, some, ecotourists, to, describe, it, as, water, dance, the, enlarged, boss, of, the, male, gharial, may, serve, as, a, sound, resonator, another, form, of, acoustic, communication, is, the, head, slap, this, typically, starts, with, an, animal, in, the, water, elevating, its, snout, and, remaining, stationary, after, some, time, the, jaws, are, opened, sharply, then, clamped, shut, with, a, biting, motion, that, makes, a, loud, slapping, sound, and, this, is, immediately, followed, by, a, loud, splash, after, which, the, head, may, be, submerged, and, copious, bubbles, produced, some, species, then, roar, while, others, slap, the, water, with, their, tails, episodes, of, head, slapping, spread, through, the, group, the, purpose, varies, but, it, seems, to, be, associated, with, maintaining, social, relationships, and, is, also, used, in, courtship, dominant, individuals, intimidate, rivals, by, swimming, at, the, surface, displaying, their, large, body, size, and, subordinate, will, submit, by, holding, its, head, forward, above, the, water, with, the, jaws, open, and, then, flee, below, eggs, and, hatchlings, have, a, high, death, rate, and, nests, face, threats, from, floods, drying, overheating, and, predators, flooding, is, a, major, cause, of, failure, of, crocodilians, to, breed, successfully, nests, are, submerged, developing, embryos, are, deprived, of, oxygen, and, juveniles, get, washed, away, numerous, predators, both, mammalian, and, reptilian, may, raid, nests, and, eat, crocodilian, eggs, even, after, hatching, and, making, it, to, the, water, hatchlings, commonly, fall, to, predation, while, the, female, is, transporting, some, to, the, nursery, area, others, are, picked, off, by, predators, that, lurk, near, the, nest, in, addition, to, terrestrial, predators, the, hatchlings, are, also, subject, to, aquatic, attacks, by, fish, birds, take, their, toll, and, in, any, clutch, there, may, be, malformed, individuals, that, are, unlikely, to, survive, in, northern, australia, the, survival, rate, for, saltwater, crocodile, hatchlings, is, only, twenty, five, percent, but, with, each, succeeding, year, of, life, this, improves, reaching, sixty, percent, by, year, five, mortality, rates, are, fairly, low, among, subadults, and, adults, though, they, are, occasionally, preyed, on, by, large, cats, and, snakes, elephants, and, hippopotamuses, may, kill, crocodiles, defensively, authorities, differ, as, to, whether, much, cannibalism, takes, place, among, crocodilians, adults, do, not, normally, eat, their, own, offspring, but, there, is, some, evidence, of, subadults, feeding, on, juveniles, and, of, adults, attacking, subadults, rival, male, nile, crocodiles, sometimes, kill, each, other, during, the, breeding, season, growth, in, hatchlings, and, young, crocodilians, depends, on, the, food,

australian, freshwater, crocodiles, take, ten, years, to, reach, maturity, at, 1, 4, m, 4, ft, 7, in, the, spectacled, caiman, matures, earlier, reaching, its, mature, length, of, 1, 2, m, 4, ft, in, four, to, seven, years, crocodilians, continue, to, grow, throughout, their, lives, males, in, particular, continue, to, gain, in, weight, as, they, get, older, but, this, is, mostly, in, the, form, of, extra, girth, rather, than, length, crocodilians, can, live, 35, 75, years, and, their, age, can, be, determined, by, growth, rings, in, their, bones, alligators, and, crocodiles, were, first, farmed, in, the, early, 20th, century, but, the, facilities, involved, were, zoo, like, and, their, main, source, of, income, was, from, tourism, by, the, early, 1960s, the, feasibility, of, farming, these, reptiles, on, a, commercial, scale, was, investigated, in, response, to, the, decline, of, many, crocodilian, species, around, the, world, farming, involves, breeding, and, rearing, captive, stock, on, a, self, contained, basis, whereas, ranching, means, the, use, of, eggs, juveniles, or, adults, taken, each, year, from, the, wild, commercial, organisations, must, satisfy, the, criteria, of, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, cites, by, demonstrating, that, in, the, area, concerned, they, do, not, adversely, impact, the, wild, population, alligator, and, crocodile, farming, began, because, of, demand, for, their, hides, but, now, nearly, all, parts, of, the, animal, are, used, the, side, and, belly, skin, make, the, best, leather, the, meat, is, eaten, the, gallbladders, are, valued, in, east, asia, and, the, heads, are, sometimes, made, into, ornaments, in, traditional, chinese, medicine, alligator, meat, is, said, to, cure, the, common, cold, and, prevent, cancer, while, various, internal, organs, are, believed, to, have, medicinal, properties, crocodilians, are, opportunistic, predators, that, are, at, their, most, dangerous, in, water, and, at, the, edge, of, water, several, species, are, known, to, attack, humans, and, may, do, so, to, defend, their, territories, nests, or, young, by, mistake, while, attacking, domestic, animals, such, as, dogs, or, for, food, as, larger, crocodilians, can, take, prey, as, big, as, or, bigger, than, humans, the, species, on, which, there, is, most, data, are, the, saltwater, crocodile, the, nile, crocodile, and, the, american, alligator, other, species, which, have, sometimes, attacked, humans, are, the, black, caiman, the, morelet, s, crocodile, the, mugger, crocodile, the, american, crocodile, the, gharial, and, the, freshwater, crocodile, the, nile, crocodile, has, a, reputation, as, the, biggest, killer, of, large, animals, including, humans, on, the, african, continent, it, is, widely, distributed, found, in, many, habitats, and, cryptically, coloured, from, a, waiting, position, with, only, its, eyes, and, nostrils, above, the, water, it, can, lunge, at, drinking, animals, fishermen, bathers, or, people, collecting, water, or, washing, clothes, once, seized, and, dragged, into, the, water, there, is, little, chance, for, the, victim, to, escape, analysis, of, attacks, show, that, most, take, place, during, the, breeding, season, or, when, crocodiles, are, guarding, nests, or, newly, hatched, young, although, many, attacks, go, unreported, there, are, estimated, to, be, over, 300, per, year, 63, of, which, are, fatal, wild, saltwater, crocodiles, in, australia, carried, out, 62, confirmed, and, unprovoked, attacks, causing, injury, or, death, between, 1971, and, 2004, these, animals, have, also, caused, fatalities, in, malaysia, new, guinea, and, elsewhere, they, are, highly, territorial, and, resent, intrusion, into, their, territories, by, other, crocodiles, humans, or, boats, such, as, canoes, attacks, may, come, from, animals, of, various, sizes, but, the, larger, males, are, generally, responsible, for, fatalities, as, their, size, increases, so, does, their, need, for, larger, mammalian, prey, pigs, cattle, horses, and, humans, are, all, within, the, size, range, they, seek, most, of, the, people, attacked, were, either, swimming, or, wading, but, in, two, instances, they, were, asleep, in, tents, american, alligators, are, recorded, as, making, 242, unprovoked, attacks, between, 1948, and, mid, 2004, causing, sixteen, human, fatalities, ten, of, these, were, in, the, water, and, two, on, land, the, circumstances, of, the, other, four, are, not, known, most, attacks, were, in, the, warmer, months, though, in, florida, with, its, warmer, climate, attacks, can, happen, at, any, time, of, year, alligators, are, considered, to, be, less, aggressive, than, either, the, nile, or, saltwater, crocodile, but, the, increase, in, density, of, the, human, population, in, the, everglades, has, brought, people, and, alligators, into, proximity, and, increased, the, risk, of, alligator, attacks, conversely, in, mauritania, where, the, crocodiles, growth, is, severely, stunted, by, the, arid, conditions, the, local, people, swim, with, them, without, being, attacked, several, species, of, crocodilian, are, traded, as, exotic, pets, they, are, appealing, when, young, but, crocodilians, do, not, make, good, pets, they, grow, large, and, are, both, dangerous, and, expensive, to, keep, as, they, grow, older, pet, crocodilians, are, often, abandoned, by, their, owners, and, feral, populations, of, spectacled, caimans, exist, in, the, united, states, and, cuba, most, countries, have, strict, regulations, for, keeping, these, reptiles, the, blood, of, alligators, and, crocodiles, contains, peptides, with, antibiotic, properties, which, may, contribute, to, future, antibacterial, drugs, cartilage, from, crocodiles, raised, in, crocodile, farms, is, also, used, in, research, to, 3d, print, new, cartilage, for, humans, by, mixing, human, stem, cells, with, liquified, crocodile, cartilage, after, proteins, that, may, trigger, the, human, immune, system, has, been, removed, the, main, threat, to, crocodilians, worldwide, is, human, activity, including, hunting, and, habitat, destruction, early, in, the, 1970s, more, than, 2, million, wild, crocodilian, skins, had, been, traded, driving, down, the, majority, of, crocodilian, populations, in, some, cases, almost, to, extinction, starting, in, 1973, cites, attempted, to, prevent, trade, in, body, parts, of, endangered, animals, such, as, the, crocodile, skins, this, proved, to, be, problematic, in, the, 1980s, as, crocodiles, were, abundant, and, dangerous, to, humans, in, some, parts, of, africa, and, it, was, legal, to, hunt, them, at, the, conference, of, the, parties, in, botswana, in, 1983, it, was, argued, on, behalf, of, aggrieved, local, people, that, it, was, reasonable, to, sell, lawfully, hunted, skins, in, the, late, 1970s, crocodiles, began, to, be, farmed, in, different, countries, started, from, eggs, taken, from, the, wild, by, the, 1980s, farmed, crocodile, skins, were, produced, in, sufficient, numbers, to, destroy, the, unlawful, trade, in, wild, crocodilians, by, 2000, skins, from, twelve, crocodilian, species, whether, harvested, lawfully, in, the, wild, or, farmed, were, traded, by, thirty, countries, and, the, unlawful, trade, had, almost, vanished, the, gharial, has, undergone, a, chronic, long, term, decline, combined, with, a, rapid, short, term, decline, leading, the, iucn, to, list, the, species, as, critically, endangered, in, 1946, the, gharial, population, had, been, widespread, numbering, around, 5, 000, to, 10, 000, by, 2006, however, it, had, declined, 96, 98, reduced, to, a, small, number, of, widely, spaced, subpopulations, of, fewer, than, 235, individuals, this, long, term, decline, had, a, number, of, causes, including, egg, collection, and, hunting, such, as, for, indigenous, medicine, the, rapid, decline, of, about, 58, between, 1997, and, 2006, was, caused, by, increasing, use, of, gill, nets, and, the, loss, of, riverine, habitat, the, gharial, population, continues, to, be, threatened, by, environmental, hazards, such, as, heavy, metals, and, protozoan, parasites, but, as, of, 2013, numbers, are, rising, due, to, the, protection, of, nests, against, egg, predators, the, chinese, alligator, was, historically, widespread, throughout, the, eastern, yangtze, river, system, but, is, currently, restricted, to, some, areas, in, southeastern, anhui, thanks, to, habitat, fragmentation, and, degradation, the, wild, population, is, believed, to, exist, only, in, small, fragmented, ponds, in, 1972, the, species, was, declared, a, class, i, endangered, species, by, the, chinese, government, and, received, the, maximum, amount, of, legal, protection, since, 1979, captive, breeding, programs, were, established, in, china, and, north, america, creating, a, healthy, captive, population, in, 2008, alligators, bred, in, the, bronx, zoo, were, successfully, reintroduced, to, chongming, island, the, philippine, crocodile, is, perhaps, the, most, threatened, crocodilian, and, is, considered, by, the, iucn, to, be, critically, endangered, hunting, and, destructive, fishing, habits, have, reduced, its, population, to, around, 100, individuals, by, 2009, in, the, same, year, 50, captive, bred, crocodiles, were, released, into, the, wild, to, help, boost, the, population, support, from, local, people, is, crucial, for, the, species, survival, the, american, alligator, has, also, suffered, serious, declines, from, hunting, and, habitat, loss, throughout, its, range, threatening, it, with, extinction, in, 1967, it, was, listed, as, an, endangered, species, but, the, united, states, fish, and, wildlife, service, and, state, wildlife, agencies, in, the, southern, united, states, stepped, in, and, worked, towards, its, recovery, protection, allowed, the, species, to, recuperate, and, in, 1987, it, was, removed, from, the, endangered, species, list, much, research, into, alligator, ranching, has, been, undertaken, at, the, rockefeller, wildlife, refuge, a, large, area, of, marshland, in, the, state, of, louisiana, income, from, the, alligators, kept, at, rockefeller, wildlife, refuge, contributes, to, conservation, of, the, marshland, a, study, examining, alligator, farms, in, the, united, states, showed, that, they, have, generated, significant, conservation, gains, and, poaching, of, wild, alligators, has, greatly, diminished, crocodilians, have, had, prominent, roles, in, the, narratives, of, various, cultures, around, the, world, and, may, even, have, inspired, stories, of, dragons, in, ancient, egyptian, religion, ammit, the, devourer, of, unworthy, souls, and, sobek, the, god, of, power, protection, and, fertility, are, both, represented, as, having, crocodile, heads, this, reflects, the, egyptians, view, of, the, crocodile, both, as, a, terrifying, predator, and, an, important, part, of, the, nile, ecosystem, the, crocodile, was, one, of, several, animals, that, the, egyptians, mummified, crocodiles, were, also, associated, with, various, water, deities, by, peoples, of, west, africa, during, the, benin, empire, crocodiles, were, considered, the, policemen, of, the, waters, and, symbolised, the, power, of, the, king, or, oba, to, punish, wrongdoers, the, leviathan, described, in, the, book, of, job, may, have, been, based, on, a, crocodile, in, mesoamerica, the, aztecs, had, a, crocodilian, god, of, fertility, named, cipactli, who,

as, much, assumption, as, observation, the, ancient, greek, historian, herodotus, c, 440, bc, described, the, crocodile, in, detail, though, much, of, his, description, is, fanciful, he, claimed, that, it, would, lie, with, its, mouth, open, to, permit, a, trochilus, bird, possibly, an, egyptian, plover, to, remove, leeches, the, crocodile, was, described, in, the, late, 13th, century,
