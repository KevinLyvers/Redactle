major, depressive, disorder, mdd, also, known, as, clinical, depression, is, a, mental, disorder, characterized, by, at, least, two, weeks, of, pervasive, low, mood, low, self, esteem, and, loss, of, interest, or, pleasure, in, normally, enjoyable, activities, introduced, by, a, group, of, us, clinicians, in, the, mid, 1970s, the, term, was, adopted, by, the, american, psychiatric, association, for, this, symptom, cluster, under, mood, disorders, in, the, 1980, version, of, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, iii, and, has, become, widely, used, since, the, disorder, causes, the, second, most, years, lived, with, disability, after, lower, back, pain, the, diagnosis, of, major, depressive, disorder, is, based, on, the, person, s, reported, experiences, behavior, reported, by, relatives, or, friends, and, a, mental, status, examination, there, is, no, laboratory, test, for, the, disorder, but, testing, may, be, done, to, rule, out, physical, conditions, that, can, cause, similar, symptoms, the, most, common, time, of, onset, is, in, a, person, s, 20s, with, females, affected, about, twice, as, often, as, males, the, course, of, the, disorder, varies, widely, from, one, episode, lasting, months, to, a, lifelong, disorder, with, recurrent, major, depressive, episodes, those, with, major, depressive, disorder, are, typically, treated, with, psychotherapy, and, antidepressant, medication, medication, appears, to, be, effective, but, the, effect, may, be, significant, only, in, the, most, severely, depressed, hospitalization, which, may, be, involuntary, may, be, necessary, in, cases, with, associated, self, neglect, or, a, significant, risk, of, harm, to, self, or, others, electroconvulsive, therapy, ect, may, be, considered, if, other, measures, are, not, effective, major, depressive, disorder, is, believed, to, be, caused, by, a, combination, of, genetic, environmental, and, psychological, factors, with, about, 40, of, the, risk, being, genetic, risk, factors, include, a, family, history, of, the, condition, major, life, changes, childhood, traumas, certain, medications, chronic, health, problems, and, substance, use, disorders, it, can, negatively, affect, a, person, s, personal, life, work, life, or, education, and, cause, issues, with, a, person, s, sleeping, habits, eating, habits, and, general, health, a, person, having, a, major, depressive, episode, usually, exhibits, a, low, mood, which, pervades, all, aspects, of, life, and, an, inability, to, experience, pleasure, in, previously, enjoyable, activities, depressed, people, may, be, preoccupied, with, or, ruminate, over, thoughts, and, feelings, of, worthlessness, inappropriate, guilt, or, regret, helplessness, or, hopelessness, other, symptoms, of, depression, include, poor, concentration, and, memory, withdrawal, from, social, situations, and, activities, reduced, sex, drive, irritability, and, thoughts, of, death, or, suicide, insomnia, is, common, in, the, typical, pattern, a, person, wakes, very, early, and, cannot, get, back, to, sleep, hypersomnia, or, oversleeping, can, also, happen, as, well, as, day, night, rhythm, disturbances, such, as, diurnal, mood, variation, some, antidepressants, may, also, cause, insomnia, due, to, their, stimulating, effect, in, severe, cases, depressed, people, may, have, psychotic, symptoms, these, symptoms, include, delusions, or, less, commonly, hallucinations, usually, unpleasant, people, who, have, had, previous, episodes, with, psychotic, symptoms, are, more, likely, to, have, them, with, future, episodes, a, depressed, person, may, report, multiple, physical, symptoms, such, as, fatigue, headaches, or, digestive, problems, physical, complaints, are, the, most, common, presenting, problem, in, developing, countries, according, to, the, world, health, organization, s, criteria, for, depression, appetite, often, decreases, resulting, in, weight, loss, although, increased, appetite, and, weight, gain, occasionally, occur, major, depression, significantly, affects, a, person, s, family, and, personal, relationships, work, or, school, life, sleeping, and, eating, habits, and, general, health, family, and, friends, may, notice, agitation, or, lethargy, older, depressed, people, may, have, cognitive, symptoms, of, recent, onset, such, as, forgetfulness, and, a, more, noticeable, slowing, of, movements, depressed, children, may, often, display, an, irritable, rather, than, a, depressed, mood, most, lose, interest, in, school, and, show, a, steep, decline, in, academic, performance, diagnosis, may, be, delayed, or, missed, when, symptoms, are, interpreted, as, normal, moodiness, elderly, people, may, not, present, with, classical, depressive, symptoms, diagnosis, and, treatment, is, further, complicated, in, that, the, elderly, are, often, simultaneously, treated, with, a, number, of, other, drugs, and, often, have, other, concurrent, diseases, the, etiology, of, depression, is, not, yet, fully, understood, the, biopsychosocial, model, proposes, that, biological, psychological, and, social, factors, all, play, a, role, in, causing, depression, the, diathesis, stress, model, specifies, that, depression, results, when, a, preexisting, vulnerability, or, diathesis, is, activated, by, stressful, life, events, the, preexisting, vulnerability, can, be, either, genetic, implying, an, interaction, between, nature, and, nurture, or, schematic, resulting, from, views, of, the, world, learned, in, childhood, american, psychiatrist, aaron, beck, suggested, that, a, triad, of, automatic, and, spontaneous, negative, thoughts, about, the, self, the, world, or, environment, and, the, future, may, lead, to, other, depressive, signs, and, symptoms, genes, play, a, major, role, in, the, development, of, depression, family, and, twin, studies, find, that, nearly, 40, of, individual, differences, in, risk, for, major, depressive, disorder, can, be, explained, by, genetic, factors, like, most, psychiatric, disorders, major, depressive, disorder, is, likely, influenced, by, many, individual, genetic, changes, in, 2018, a, genome, wide, association, study, discovered, 44, genetic, variants, linked, to, risk, for, major, depression, a, 2019, study, found, 102, variants, in, the, genome, linked, to, depression, however, it, appears, that, major, depression, is, less, heritable, compared, to, bipolar, disorder, and, schizophrenia, research, focusing, on, specific, candidate, genes, has, been, criticized, for, its, tendency, to, generate, false, positive, findings, there, are, also, other, efforts, to, examine, interactions, between, life, stress, and, polygenic, risk, for, depression, depression, can, also, arise, after, a, chronic, or, terminal, medical, condition, such, as, hiv, aids, or, asthma, and, may, be, labeled, secondary, depression, it, is, unknown, whether, the, underlying, diseases, induce, depression, through, effect, on, quality, of, life, or, through, shared, etiologies, such, as, degeneration, of, the, basal, ganglia, in, parkinson, s, disease, or, immune, dysregulation, in, asthma, depression, may, also, be, iatrogenic, the, result, of, healthcare, such, as, drug, induced, depression, therapies, associated, with, depression, include, interferons, beta, blockers, isotretinoin, contraceptives, cardiac, agents, anticonvulsants, antimigraine, drugs, antipsychotics, and, hormonal, agents, such, as, gonadotropin, releasing, hormone, agonist, gnrh, agonist, celiac, disease, is, another, possible, contributing, factor, substance, use, in, early, age, is, associated, with, increased, risk, of, developing, depression, later, in, life, depression, occurring, after, giving, birth, is, called, postpartum, depression, and, is, thought, to, be, the, result, of, hormonal, changes, associated, with, pregnancy, seasonal, affective, disorder, a, type, of, depression, associated, with, seasonal, changes, in, sunlight, is, thought, to, be, triggered, by, decreased, sunlight, vitamin, b, 2, b, 6, and, b, 12, deficiency, may, cause, depression, in, females, adverse, childhood, experiences, incorporating, childhood, abuse, neglect, and, family, dysfunction, markedly, increase, the, risk, of, major, depression, especially, if, more, than, one, type, childhood, trauma, also, correlates, with, severity, of, depression, poor, responsiveness, to, treatment, and, length, of, illness, some, are, more, susceptible, than, others, to, developing, mental, illness, such, as, depression, after, trauma, and, various, genes, have, been, suggested, to, control, susceptibility, couples, in, unhappy, marriages, have, a, higher, risk, of, developing, clinical, depression, there, appears, to, be, a, link, between, air, pollution, and, depression, and, suicide, there, may, be, an, association, between, long, term, pm2, 5, exposure, and, depression, and, a, possible, association, between, short, term, pm10, exposure, and, suicide, the, pathophysiology, of, depression, is, not, completely, understood, but, current, theories, center, around, monoaminergic, systems, the, circadian, rhythm, immunological, dysfunction, hpa, axis, dysfunction, and, structural, or, functional, abnormalities, of, emotional, circuits, derived, from, the, effectiveness, of, monoaminergic, drugs, in, treating, depression, the, monoamine, theory, posits, that, insufficient, activity, of, monoamine, neurotransmitters, is, the, primary, cause, of, depression, evidence, for, the, monoamine, theory, comes, from, multiple, areas, first, acute, depletion, of, tryptophan, a, necessary, precursor, of, serotonin, and, a, monoamine, can, cause, depression, in, those, in, remission, or, relatives, of, people, who, are, depressed, suggesting, that, decreased, serotonergic, neurotransmission, is, important, in, depression, second, the, correlation, between, depression, risk, and, polymorphisms, in, the, 5, httlpr, gene, which, codes, for, serotonin, receptors, suggests, a, link, third, decreased, size, of, the, locus, coeruleus, decreased, activity, of, tyrosine, hydroxylase, increased, density, of, alpha, 2, adrenergic, receptor, and, evidence, from, rat, models, suggest, decreased, adrenergic, neurotransmission, in, depression, furthermore, decreased, levels, of, homovanillic, acid, altered, response, to, dextroamphetamine, responses, of, depressive, symptoms, to, dopamine, receptor, agonists, decreased, dopamine, receptor, d1, binding, in, the, striatum, and, polymorphism, of, dopamine, receptor, genes, implicate, dopamine, another, monoamine, in, depression, lastly, increased, activity, of, monoamine, oxidase, which, degrades, monoamines, has, been, associated, with, depression, however, the, monoamine, theory, is, inconsistent, with, observations, that, serotonin, depletion, does, not, cause, depression, in, healthy, persons, that, antidepressants, instantly, increase, levels, of, monoamines, but, take, weeks, to, work, and, the, existence, of, atypical, antidepressants, which, can, be, effective, despite, not, targeting, this, pathway, one, proposed, explanation, for, the, therapeutic, lag, and, further, support, for, the, deficiency, of, monoamines, is, a, desensitization, of, self, inhibition, in, raphe, nuclei, by, the, increased, serotonin, mediated, by, antidepressants, however, disinhibition, of, the, dorsal, raphe, has, been, proposed, to, occur, as, a, result, of, decreased, serotonergic, activity, in, tryptophan, depletion, resulting, in, a, depressed, state, mediated, by, increased, serotonin, further, countering, the, monoamine, hypothesis, is, the, fact, that, rats, with, lesions, of, the, dorsal, raphe, are, not, more, depressive, than, controls, the, finding, of, increased, jugular, 5, hiaa, in, people, who, are, depressed, that, normalized, with, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitor, ssri, treatment, and, the, preference, for, carbohydrates, in, people, who, are, depressed, already, limited, the, monoamine, hypothesis, has, been, further, oversimplified, when, presented, to, the, general, public, a, 2022, review, found, no, consistent, evidence, supporting, the, serotonin, hypothesis, linking, serotonin, levels, and, depression, hpa, axis, abnormalities, have, been, suggested, in, depression, given, the, association, of, crhr1, with, depression, and, the, increased, frequency, of, dexamethasone, test, non, suppression, in, people, who, are, depressed, however, this, abnormality, is, not, adequate, as, a, diagnosis, tool, because, its, sensitivity, is, only, 44, these, stress, related, abnormalities, are, thought, to, be, the, cause, of, hippocampal, volume, reductions, seen, in, people, who, are, depressed, furthermore, a, meta, analysis, yielded, decreased, dexamethasone, suppression, and, increased, response, to, psychological, stressors, further, abnormal, results, have, been, obscured, with, the, cortisol, awakening, response, with, increased, response, being, associated, with, depression, there, is, also, a, connection, between, the, gut, microbiome, and, the, central, nervous, system, otherwise, known, as, the, gut, brain, axis, which, is, a, two, way, communication, system, between, the, brain, and, the, gut, experiments, have, shown, that, microbiota, in, the, gut, can, play, an, important, role, in, depression, as, people, with, mdd, often, have, gut, brain, dysfunction, one, analysis, showed, that, those, with, mdd, have, different, bacteria, living, in, their, guts, bacteria, bacteroidetes, and, firmicutes, were, most, affected, in, people, with, mdd, and, they, are, also, impacted, in, people, with, irritable, bowel, syndrome, another, study, showed, that, people, with, ibs, have, a, higher, chance, of, developing, depression, which, shows, the, two, are, connected, there, is, even, evidence, suggesting, that, altering, the, microbes, in, the, gut, can, have, regulatory, effects, on, developing, depression, theories, unifying, neuroimaging, findings, have, been, proposed, the, first, model, proposed, is, the, limbic, cortical, model, which, involves, hyperactivity, of, the, ventral, paralimbic, regions, and, hypoactivity, of, frontal, regulatory, regions, in, emotional, processing, another, model, the, cortico, striatal, model, suggests, that, abnormalities, of, the, prefrontal, cortex, in, regulating, striatal, and, subcortical, structures, result, in, depression, another, model, proposes, hyperactivity, of, salience, structures, in, identifying, negative, stimuli, and, hypoactivity, of, cortical, regulatory, structures, resulting, in, a, negative, emotional, bias, and, depression, consistent, with, emotional, bias, studies, the, newer, field, of, psychoneuroimmunology, the, study, between, the, immune, system, and, the, nervous, system, and, emotional, state, suggests, that, cytokines, may, impact, depression, immune, system, abnormalities, have, been, observed, including, increased, levels, of, cytokines, cells, produced, by, immune, cells, that, affect, inflammation, involved, in, generating, sickness, behavior, creating, a, pro, inflammatory, profile, in, mdd, some, people, with, depression, have, increased, levels, of, pro, inflammatory, cytokines, and, some, have, decreased, levels, of, anti, inflammatory, cytokines, research, suggests, that, treatments, can, reduce, pro, inflammatory, cell, production, like, the, experimental, treatment, of, ketamine, with, treatment, resistant, depression, with, this, in, mdd, people, will, more, likely, have, a, th, 1, dominant, immune, profile, which, is, a, pro, inflammatory, profile, this, suggests, that, there, are, components, of, the, immune, system, affecting, the, pathology, of, mdd, another, way, cytokines, can, affect, depression, is, in, the, kynurenine, pathway, and, when, this, is, overactivated, it, can, cause, depression, this, can, be, due, to, too, much, microglial, activation, and, too, little, astrocytic, activity, when, microglia, get, activated, they, release, pro, inflammatory, cytokines, that, cause, an, increase, in, the, production, of, cox, 2, this, in, turn, causes, the, production, of, pge, 2, which, is, a, prostaglandin, and, this, catalyzes, the, production, of, indolamine, ido, ido, causes, tryptophan, to, get, converted, into, kynurenine, and, kynurenine, becomes, quinolinic, acid, quinolinic, acid, is, an, agonist, for, nmda, receptors, so, it, activates, the, pathway, studies, have, shown, that, the, post, mortem, brains, of, patients, with, mdd, have, higher, levels, of, quinolinic, acid, than, people, who, did, not, have, mdd, with, this, researchers, have, also, seen, that, the, concentration, of, quinolinic, acid, correlates, to, the, severity, of, depressive, symptoms, a, diagnostic, assessment, may, be, conducted, by, a, suitably, trained, general, practitioner, or, by, a, psychiatrist, or, psychologist, who, records, the, person, s, current, circumstances, biographical, history, current, symptoms, family, history, and, alcohol, and, drug, use, the, assessment, also, includes, a, mental, state, examination, which, is, an, assessment, of, the, person, s, current, mood, and, thought, content, in, particular, the, presence, of, themes, of, hopelessness, or, pessimism, self, harm, or, suicide, and, an, absence, of, positive, thoughts, or, plans, specialist, mental, health, services, are, rare, in, rural, areas, and, thus, diagnosis, and, management, is, left, largely, to, primary, care, clinicians, this, issue, is, even, more, marked, in, developing, countries, rating, scales, are, not, used, to, diagnose, depression, but, they, provide, an, indication, of, the, severity, of, symptoms, for, a, time, period, so, a, person, who, scores, above, a, given, cut, off, point, can, be, more, thoroughly, evaluated, for, a, depressive, disorder, diagnosis, several, rating, scales, are, used, for, this, purpose, these, include, the, hamilton, rating, scale, for, depression, the, beck, depression, inventory, or, the, suicide, behaviors, questionnaire, revised, primary, care, physicians, have, more, difficulty, with, underrecognition, and, undertreatment, of, depression, compared, to, psychiatrists, these, cases, may, be, missed, because, for, some, people, with, depression, physical, symptoms, often, accompany, depression, in, addition, there, may, also, be, barriers, related, to, the, person, provider, and, or, the, medical, system, non, psychiatrist, physicians, have, been, shown, to, miss, about, two, thirds, of, cases, although, there, is, some, evidence, of, improvement, in, the, number, of, missed, cases, a, doctor, generally, performs, a, medical, examination, and, selected, investigations, to, rule, out, other, causes, of, depressive, symptoms, these, include, blood, tests, measuring, tsh, and, thyroxine, to, exclude, hypothyroidism, basic, electrolytes, and, serum, calcium, to, rule, out, a, metabolic, disturbance, and, a, full, blood, count, including, esr, to, rule, out, a, systemic, infection, or, chronic, disease, adverse, affective, reactions, to, medications, or, alcohol, misuse, may, be, ruled, out, as, well, testosterone, levels, may, be, evaluated, to, diagnose, hypogonadism, a, cause, of, depression, in, men, vitamin, d, levels, might, be, evaluated, as, low, levels, of, vitamin, d, have, been, associated, with, greater, risk, for, depression, subjective, cognitive, complaints, appear, in, older, depressed, people, but, they, can, also, be, indicative, of, the, onset, of, a, dementing, disorder, such, as, alzheimer, s, disease, cognitive, testing, and, brain, imaging, can, help, distinguish, depression, from, dementia, a, ct, scan, can, exclude, brain, pathology, in, those, with, psychotic, rapid, onset, or, otherwise, unusual, symptoms, no, biological, tests, confirm, major, depression, in, general, investigations, are, not, repeated, for, a, subsequent, episode, unless, there, is, a, medical, indication, the, most, widely, used, criteria, for, diagnosing, depressive, conditions, are, found, in, the, american, psychiatric, association, s, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, and, the, world, health, organization, s, international, statistical, classification, of, diseases, and, related, health, problems, icd, the, latter, system, is, typically, used, in, european, countries, while, the, former, is, used, in, the, us, and, many, other, non, european, nations, and, the, authors, of, both, have, worked, towards, conforming, one, with, the, other, both, dsm, and, icd, mark, out, typical, main, depressive, symptoms, the, most, recent, edition, of, the, dsm, is, the, fifth, edition, text, revision, dsm, 5, tr, and, the, most, recent, edition, of, the, icd, is, the, eleventh, edition, icd, 11, under, mood, disorders, icd, 11, classifies, major, depressive, disorder, as, either, single, episode, depressive, disorder, where, there, is, no, history, of, depressive, episodes, or, of, mania, or, recurrent, depressive, disorder, where, there, is, a, history, of, prior, episodes, with, no, history, of, mania, icd, 11, symptoms, present, nearly, every, day, for, at, least, two, weeks, are, a, depressed, mood, or, anhedonia, accompanied, by, other, symptoms, such, as, difficulty, concentrating, feelings, of, worthlessness, or, excessive, or, inappropriate, guilt, hopelessness, recurrent, thoughts, of, death, or, suicide, changes, in, appetite, or, sleep, psychomotor, agitation, or, retardation, and, reduced, energy, or, fatigue, these, symptoms, must, affect, work, social, or, domestic, activities, the, icd, 11, system, allows, further, specifiers, for, the, current, depressive, episode, the, severity, mild, moderate, severe, unspecified, the, presence, of, psychotic, symptoms, with, or, without, psychotic, symptoms, and, the, degree, of, remission, if, relevant, currently, in, partial, remission, currently, in, full, remission, these, two, disorders, are, classified, as, depressive, disorders, in, the, category, of, mood, disorders, according, to, dsm, 5, at, least, one, of, the, symptoms, is, either, depressed, mood, or, loss, of, interest, or, pleasure, depressed, mood, occurs, nearly, every, day, as, subjective, feelings, like, sadness, emptiness, and, hopelessness, or, observations, made, by, others, e, g, appears, tearful, loss, of, interest, or, pleasure, occurs, in, all, or, almost, all, activities, of, the, day, nearly, every, day, these, symptoms, as, well, as, five, out, of, the, nine, more, specific, symptoms, listed, must, frequently, occur, for, more, than, two, weeks, to, the, extent, in, which, it, impairs, functioning, for, the, diagnosis, major, depressive, disorder, is, classified, as, a, mood, disorder, in, the, dsm, 5, the, diagnosis, hinges, on, the, presence, of, single, or, recurrent, major, depressive, episodes, further, qualifiers, are, used, to, classify, both, the, episode, itself, and, the, course, of, the, disorder, the, category, unspecified, depressive, disorder, is, diagnosed, if, the, depressive, episode, s, manifestation, does, not, meet, the, criteria, for, a, major, depressive, episode, a, major, depressive, episode, is, characterized, by, the, presence, of, a, severely, depressed, mood, that, persists, for, at, least, two, weeks, episodes, may, be, isolated, or, recurrent, and, are, categorized, as, mild, few, symptoms, in, excess, of, minimum, criteria, moderate, or, severe, marked, impact, on, social, or, occupational, functioning, an, episode, with, psychotic, features, commonly, referred, to, as, psychotic, depression, is, automatically, rated, as, severe, if, the, person, has, had, an, episode, of, mania, or, markedly, elevated, mood, a, diagnosis, of, bipolar, disorder, is, made, instead, depression, without, mania, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, unipolar, because, the, mood, remains, at, one, emotional, state, or, pole, bereavement, is, not, an, exclusion, criterion, in, the, dsm, 5, and, it, is, up, to, the, clinician, to, distinguish, between, normal, reactions, to, a, loss, and, mdd, excluded, are, a, range, of, related, diagnoses, including, dysthymia, which, involves, a, chronic, but, milder, mood, disturbance, recurrent, brief, depression, consisting, of, briefer, depressive, episodes, minor, depressive, disorder, whereby, only, some, symptoms, of, major, depression, are, present, and, adjustment, disorder, with, depressed, mood, which, denotes, low, mood, resulting, from, a, psychological, response, to, an, identifiable, event, or, stressor, the, dsm, 5, recognizes, six, further, subtypes, of, mdd, called, specifiers, in, addition, to, noting, the, length, severity, and, presence, of, psychotic, features, to, confirm, major, depressive, disorder, as, the, most, likely, diagnosis, other, potential, diagnoses, must, be, considered, including, dysthymia, adjustment, disorder, with, depressed, mood, or, bipolar, disorder, dysthymia, is, a, chronic, milder, mood, disturbance, in, which, a, person, reports, a, low, mood, almost, daily, over, a, span, of, at, least, two, years, the, symptoms, are, not, as, severe, as, those, for, major, depression, although, people, with, dysthymia, are, vulnerable, to, secondary, episodes, of, major, depression, sometimes, referred, to, as, double, depression, adjustment, disorder, with, depressed, mood, is, a, mood, disturbance, appearing, as, a, psychological, response, to, an, identifiable, event, or, stressor, in, which, the, resulting, emotional, or, behavioral, symptoms, are, significant, but, do, not, meet, the, criteria, for, a, major, depressive, episode, other, disorders, need, to, be, ruled, out, before, diagnosing, major, depressive, disorder, they, include, depressions, due, to, physical, illness, medications, and, substance, use, disorders, depression, due, to, physical, illness, is, diagnosed, as, a, mood, disorder, due, to, a, general, medical, condition, this, condition, is, determined, based, on, history, laboratory, findings, or, physical, examination, when, the, depression, is, caused, by, a, medication, non, medical, use, of, a, psychoactive, substance, or, exposure, to, a, toxin, it, is, then, diagnosed, as, a, specific, mood, disorder, previously, called, substance, induced, mood, disorder, preventive, efforts, may, result, in, decreases, in, rates, of, the, condition, of, between, 22, and, 38, since, 2016, the, united, states, preventive, services, task, force, uspstf, has, recommended, screening, for, depression, among, those, over, the, age, 12, though, a, 2005, cochrane, review, found, that, the, routine, use, of, screening, questionnaires, has, little, effect, on, detection, or, treatment, screening, the, general, population, is, not, recommended, by, authorities, in, the, uk, or, canada, behavioral, interventions, such, as, interpersonal, therapy, and, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, are, effective, at, preventing, new, onset, depression, because, such, interventions, appear, to, be, most, effective, when, delivered, to, individuals, or, small, groups, it, has, been, suggested, that, they, may, be, able, to, reach, their, large, target, audience, most, efficiently, through, the, internet, the, netherlands, mental, health, care, system, provides, preventive, interventions, such, as, the, coping, with, depression, course, cwd, for, people, with, sub, threshold, depression, the, course, is, claimed, to, be, the, most, successful, of, psychoeducational, interventions, for, the, treatment, and, prevention, of, depression, both, for, its, adaptability, to, various, populations, and, its, results, with, a, risk, reduction, of, 38, in, major, depression, and, an, efficacy, as, a, treatment, comparing, favorably, to, other, psychotherapies, the, most, common, and, effective, treatments, for, depression, are, psychotherapy, medication, and, electroconvulsive, therapy, ect, a, combination, of, treatments, is, the, most, effective, approach, when, depression, is, resistant, to, treatment, american, psychiatric, association, treatment, guidelines, recommend, that, initial, treatment, should, be, individually, tailored, based, on, factors, including, severity, of, symptoms, co, existing, disorders, prior, treatment, experience, and, personal, preference, options, may, include, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, exercise, ect, transcranial, magnetic, stimulation, tms, or, light, therapy, antidepressant,

depression, because, the, risk, benefit, ratio, is, poor, the, guidelines, recommend, that, antidepressants, treatment, in, combination, with, psychosocial, interventions, should, be, considered, for, the, guidelines, further, note, that, antidepressant, treatment, should, be, continued, for, at, least, six, months, to, reduce, the, risk, of, relapse, and, that, ssris, are, better, tolerated, than,

including, psychotherapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical, social, workers, counselors, and, psychiatric, nurses, a, 2012, review, found, psychotherapy, to, be, better, than, no, treatment, but, not, other, treatments, with, more, complex, and, chronic, forms, of, depression, a, combination, of, medication, and, psychotherapy, may, be, used, there, is, moderate, quality, evidence, that,

the, most, studied, form, of, psychotherapy, for, depression, is, cbt, which, teaches, clients, to, challenge, self, defeating, but, enduring, ways, of, thinking, cognitions, and, change, counter, productive, behaviors, cbt, can, perform, as, well, as, antidepressants, in, people, with, major, depression, cbt, has, the, most, research, evidence, for, the, treatment, of, depression, in, children, and, adolescents, and, cbt, and, interpersonal, psychotherapy, ipt, are, preferred, therapies, for, adolescent, depression, in, people, under, 18, according, to, the, national, institute,

tradition, of, psychoanalysis, but, less, intensive, meeting, once, or, twice, a, week, it, also, tends, to, focus, more, on, the, person, s, immediate, problems, and, has, an, additional, social, and, interpersonal, focus, in, a, meta, analysis, of, three, controlled, trials, of, short, psychodynamic, supportive, psychotherapy, this, modification, was, found, to, be, as, effective, as, medication, for, mild, to, moderate, depression, conflicting, results, have, arisen, from, studies, that, look, at, the, effectiveness, of, antidepressants, in, people, with, acute, mild, to, moderate, depression, a, review, commissioned, by, the, national, institute, for, health, and, care, excellence, uk, concluded, that, there, is, strong, evidence, that, ssris, such, as, escitalopram, paroxetine, and, sertraline, have, greater, efficacy, than, placebo, on, achieving, a, 50, reduction, in, depression, scores, in, moderate, and, severe, major, depression, and, that, there, is, some, evidence, for, a, similar, effect, in, mild, depression, similarly, a, cochrane, systematic, review, of, clinical, trials, of, the, generic, tricyclic, antidepressant, amitriptyline, concluded, that, there, is, strong, evidence, that, its, efficacy, is, superior, to, placebo, antidepressants, work, less, well, for, the, elderly, than, for, younger, individuals, with, depression, to, find, the, most, effective, antidepressant, medication, with, minimal, side, effects, the, dosages, can, be, adjusted, and, if, necessary, combinations, of, different, classes, of, antidepressants, can, be, tried, response, rates, to, the, first, antidepressant, administered, range, from, 50, to, 75, and, it, can, take, at, least, six, to, eight, weeks, from, the, start, of, medication, to, improvement, antidepressant, medication, treatment, is, usually, continued, for, 16, to, 20, weeks, after, remission, to, minimize, the, chance, of, recurrence, and, even, up, to, one, year, of, continuation, is, recommended, people, with, chronic, depression, may, need, to, take, medication, indefinitely, to, avoid, relapse, ssris, are, the, primary, medications, prescribed, owing, to, their, relatively, mild, side, effects, and, because, they, are, less, toxic, in, overdose, than, other, antidepressants, people, who, do, not, respond, to, one, ssri, can, be, switched, to, another, antidepressant, and, this, results, in, improvement, in, almost, 50, of, cases, another, option, is, to, augment, the, atypical, antidepressant, bupropion, to, the, ssri, as, an, adjunctive, treatment, venlafaxine, an, antidepressant, with, a, different, mechanism, of, action, may, be, modestly, more, effective, than, ssris, however, venlafaxine, is, not, recommended, in, the, uk, as, a, first, line, treatment, because, of, evidence, suggesting, its, risks, may, outweigh, benefits, and, it, is, specifically, discouraged, in, children, and, adolescents, as, it, increases, the, risk, of, suicidal, thoughts, or, attempts, for, children, and, adolescents, with, moderate, to, severe, depressive, disorder, fluoxetine, seems, to, be, the, best, treatment, either, with, or, without, cognitive, behavioural, therapy, but, more, research, is, needed, to, be, certain, sertraline, escitalopram, duloxetine, might, also, help, in, reducing, symptoms, some, antidepressants, have, not, been, shown, to, be, effective, medications, are, not, recommended, in, children, with, mild, disease, there, is, also, insufficient, evidence, to, determine, effectiveness, in, those, with, depression, complicated, by, dementia, any, antidepressant, can, cause, low, blood, sodium, levels, nevertheless, it, has, been, reported, more, often, with, ssris, it, is, not, uncommon, for, ssris, to, cause, or, worsen, insomnia, the, sedating, atypical, antidepressant, mirtazapine, can, be, used, in, such, cases, irreversible, monoamine, oxidase, inhibitors, an, older, class, of, antidepressants, have, been, plagued, by, potentially, life, threatening, dietary, and, drug, interactions, they, are, still, used, only, rarely, although, newer, and, better, tolerated, agents, of, this, class, have, been, developed, the, safety, profile, is, different, with, reversible, monoamine, oxidase, inhibitors, such, as, moclobemide, where, the, risk, of, serious, dietary, interactions, is, negligible, and, dietary, restrictions, are, less, strict, it, is, unclear, whether, antidepressants, affect, a, person, s, risk, of, suicide, for, children, adolescents, and, probably, young, adults, between, 18, and, 24, years, old, there, is, a, higher, risk, of, both, suicidal, ideations, and, suicidal, behavior, in, those, treated, with, ssris, for, adults, it, is, unclear, whether, ssris, affect, the, risk, of, suicidality, one, review, found, no, connection, another, an, increased, risk, and, a, third, no, risk, in, those, 25, 65, years, old, and, a, decreased, risk, in, those, more, than, 65, a, black, box, warning, was, introduced, in, the, united, states, in, 2007, on, ssris, and, other, antidepressant, medications, due, to, the, increased, risk, of, suicide, in, people, younger, than, 24, years, old, similar, precautionary, notice, revisions, were, implemented, by, the, japanese, ministry, of, health, the, combined, use, of, antidepressants, plus, benzodiazepines, demonstrates, improved, effectiveness, when, compared, to, antidepressants, alone, but, these, effects, may, not, endure, the, addition, of, a, benzodiazepine, is, balanced, against, possible, harms, and, other, alternative, treatment, strategies, when, antidepressant, mono, therapy, is, considered, inadequate, for, treatment, resistant, depression, adding, on, the, atypical, antipsychotic, brexpiprazole, for, short, term, or, acute, management, may, be, considered, brexpiprazole, may, be, effective, for, some, people, however, the, evidence, as, of, 2023, supporting, its, use, is, weak, and, this, medication, has, potential, adverse, effects, including, weight, gain, and, akathisia, brexpiprazole, has, not, been, sufficiently, studied, in, older, people, or, children, and, the, use, and, effectiveness, of, this, adjunctive, therapy, for, longer, term, management, is, not, clear, ketamine, may, have, a, rapid, antidepressant, effect, lasting, less, than, two, weeks, there, is, limited, evidence, of, any, effect, after, that, common, acute, side, effects, and, longer, term, studies, of, safety, and, adverse, effects, are, needed, a, nasal, spray, form, of, esketamine, was, approved, by, the, fda, in, march, 2019, for, use, in, treatment, resistant, depression, when, combined, with, an, oral, antidepressant, risk, of, substance, use, disorder, and, concerns, about, its, safety,

as, stroke, other, cardiovascular, diseases, parkinson, s, disease, and, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, the, ancient, greek, physician, hippocrates, described, a, syndrome, of, melancholia, melankhol, a, as, a, distinct, disease, with, particular, mental, and, physical, symptoms, he, characterized, all, fears, and, despondencies, if, they, last, a, long, time, as, being, symptomatic, of, the, ailment, it, was, a, similar, but, far, broader, concept, than, today, s, depression, prominence, was, given, to, a, clustering, of, the, symptoms, of, sadness, dejection, and, despondency, and, often, fear, anger, delusions, and, obsessions, were, included, the, term, depression, itself, was, derived, from, the, latin, verb, deprimere, meaning, to, press, down, from, the, 14th, century, to, depress, meant, to, subjugate, or, to, bring, down, in, spirits, it, was, used, in, 1665, in, english, author, richard, baker, s, chronicle, to, refer, to, someone, having, a, great, depression, of, spirit, and, by, english, author, samuel, johnson, in, a, similar, sense, in, 1753, the, term, also, came, into, use, in, physiology, and, economics, an, early, usage, referring, to, a, psychiatric, symptom, was, by, french, psychiatrist, louis, delasiauve, in, 1856, and, by, the, 1860s, it, was, appearing, in, medical, dictionaries, to, refer, to, a, physiological, and, metaphorical, lowering, of, emotional, function, since, aristotle, melancholia, had, been, associated, with, men, of, learning, and, intellectual, brilliance, a, hazard, of, contemplation, and, creativity, however, by, the, 19th, century, this, association, has, largely, shifted, and, melancholia, became, more, commonly, linked, with, women, although, melancholia, remained, the, dominant, diagnostic, term, depression, gained, increasing, currency, in, medical, treatises, and, was, a, synonym, by, the, end, of, the, century, german, psychiatrist, emil, kraepelin, may, have, been, the, first, to, use, it, as, the, overarching, term, referring, to, different, kinds, of, melancholia, as, depressive, states, freud, likened, the, state, of, melancholia, to, mourning, in, his, 1917, paper, mourning, and, melancholia, he, theorized, that, objective, loss, such, as, the, loss, of, a, valued, relationship, through, death, or, a, romantic, break, up, results, in, subjective, loss, as, well, the, depressed, individual, has, identified, with, the, object, of, affection, through, an, unconscious, narcissistic, process, called, the, libidinal, cathexis, of, the, ego, such, loss, results, in, severe, melancholic, symptoms, more, profound, than, mourning, not, only, is, the, outside, world, viewed, negatively, but, the, ego, itself, is, compromised, the, person, s, decline, of, self, perception, is, revealed, in, his, belief, of, his, own, blame, inferiority, and, unworthiness, he, also, emphasized, early, life, experiences, as, a, predisposing, factor, adolf, meyer, put, forward, a, mixed, social, and, biological, framework, emphasizing, reactions, in, the, context, of, an, individual, s, life, and, argued, that, the, term, depression, should, be, used, instead, of, melancholia, the, first, version, of, the, dsm, dsm, i, 1952, contained, depressive, reaction, and, the, dsm, ii, 1968, depressive, neurosis, defined, as, an, excessive, reaction, to, internal, conflict, or, an, identifiable, event, and, also, included, a, depressive, type, of, manic, depressive, psychosis, within, major, affective, disorders, the, term, unipolar, along, with, the, related, term, bipolar, was, coined, by, the, neurologist, and, psychiatrist, karl, kleist, and, subsequently, used, by, his, disciples, edda, neele, and, karl, leonhard, the, term, major, depressive, disorder, was, introduced, by, a, group, of, us, clinicians, in, the, mid, 1970s, as, part, of, proposals, for, diagnostic, criteria, based, on, patterns, of, symptoms, called, the, research, diagnostic, criteria, building, on, earlier, feighner, criteria, and, was, incorporated, into, the, dsm, iii, in, 1980, the, american, psychiatric, association, added, major, depressive, disorder, to, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, iii, as, a, split, of, the, previous, depressive, neurosis, in, the, dsm, ii, which, also, encompassed, the, conditions, now,

diagnostic, threshold, to, mark, a, mild, depressive, episode, adding, higher, threshold, categories, for, moderate, and, severe, episodes, the, ancient, idea, of, melancholia, still, survives, in, the, notion, of, a, melancholic, subtype, the, new, definitions, of, depression, were, widely, accepted, albeit, with, some, conflicting, findings, and, views, there, have, been, some, continued, empirically, based, arguments, for, a, return, to, the, diagnosis, of, melancholia, there, has, been, some, criticism, of, the, expansion, of, coverage, of, the, diagnosis, related, to, the, development, and, promotion, of, antidepressants, and, the, biological, model, since, the, late, 1950s, the, term, depression, is, used, in, a, number, of, different, ways, it, is, often, used, to, mean, this, syndrome, but, may, refer, to, other, mood, disorders, or, simply, to, a, low, mood, people, s, conceptualizations, of, depression, vary, widely, both, within, and, among, cultures, because, of, the, lack, of, scientific, certainty, one, commentator, has, observed, the, debate, over, depression, turns, on, questions, of, language, what, we, call, it, disease, disorder, state, of, mind, affects, how, we, view, diagnose, and, treat, it, there, are, cultural, differences, in, the, extent, to, which, serious, depression, is, considered, an, illness, requiring, personal, professional, treatment, or, an, indicator, of, something, else, such, as, the, need, to, address, social, or, moral, problems, the, result, of, biological, imbalances, or, a, reflection, of, individual, differences, in, the, understanding, of, distress, that, may, reinforce, feelings, of, powerlessness, and, emotional, struggle, cultural, differences, contribute, to, different, prevalence, of, symptoms, do, the, chinese, somatize, depression, a, cross, cultural, study, by, parker, et, al, discusses, the, cultural, differences, in, prevalent, symptoms, of, depression, between, individualistic, and, collectivistic, cultures, the, authors, reveal, that, individuals, with, depression, in, collectivistic, cultures, tend, to, present, more, somatic, symptoms, and, less, affective, symptoms, compared, to, those, in, individualistic, cultures, the, finding, suggests, that, individualistic, cultures, warranting, or, validating, one, s, expression, of, emotions, explains, this, cultural, difference, since, collectivistic, cultures, see, this, as, a, taboo, against, the, social, cooperation, it, deems, one, of, the, most, significant, values, historical, figures, were, often, reluctant, to, discuss, or, seek, treatment, for, depression, due, to, social, stigma, about, the, condition, or, due, to, ignorance, of, diagnosis, or, treatments, nevertheless, analysis, or, interpretation, of, letters, journals, artwork, writings, or, statements, of, family, and, friends, of, some, historical, personalities, has, led, to, the, presumption, that, they, may, have, had, some, form, of, depression, people, who, may, have, had, depression, include, english, author, mary, shelley, american, british, writer, henry, james, and, american, president, abraham,

pioneering, psychologists, such, as, americans, william, james, and, john, b, watson, dealt, with, their, own, depression, there, has, been, a, continuing, discussion, of, whether, neurological, disorders, and, mood, disorders, may, be, linked, to, creativity, a, discussion, that, goes, back, to, aristotelian, times, british, literature, gives, many, examples, of, reflections, on, depression, english, philosopher, john, stuart, mill, experienced, a, several, months, long, period, of, what, he, called, a, dull, state, of, nerves, when, one, is, unsusceptible, to, enjoyment, or, pleasurable, excitement, one, of, those, moods, when, what, is, pleasure, at, other, times, becomes, insipid, or, indifferent, he, quoted, english, poet, samuel, taylor, coleridge, s, dejection, as, a, perfect,

english, writer, samuel, johnson, used, the, term, the, black, dog, in, the, 1780s, to, describe, his, own, depression, and, it, was, subsequently, popularized, by, british, prime, minister, sir,
