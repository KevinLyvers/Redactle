conepatus, mephitis, spilogale, brachyprotoma, mydaus, palaeomephitis, promephitis, skunks, are, mammals, in, the, family, mephitidae, they, are, known, for, their, ability, to, spray, a, liquid, with, a, strong, unpleasant, scent, from, their, anal, glands, different, species, of, skunk, vary, in, appearance, from, black, and, white, to, brown, cream, or, ginger, colored, but, all, have, warning, coloration, while, related, to, polecats, and, other, members, of, the, weasel, family, skunks, have, as, their, closest, relatives, the, old, world, stink, badgers, in, alphabetical, order, the, living, species, of, skunks, are, the, word, skunk, is, dated, from, the, 1630s, adapted, from, a, southern, new, england, algonquian, language, probably, abenaki, seganku, from, proto,

a, colloquial, nickname, for, a, skunk, even, though, polecats, are, only, distantly, related, to, skunks, as, a, verb, skunk, is, used, to, describe, the, act, of, overwhelmingly, defeating, an, opponent, in, a, game, or, competition, skunk, is, also, used, to, refer, to, certain, strong, smelling, strains, of, cannabis, whose, smell, has, been, compared, to, that, of, a, skunk, s, spray, skunk, species, vary, in, size, from, about, 15, 6, to, 37, in, 40, to, 94, cm, long, and, in, weight, from, about, 1, 1, lb, 0, 50, kg, spotted, skunks, to, 18, lb, 8, 2, kg, hog, nosed, skunks, they, have, moderately, elongated, bodies, with, relatively, short, well, muscled, legs, and, long, front, claws, for, digging, they, have, five, toes, on, each, foot, although, the, most, common, fur, color, is, black, and, white, some, skunks, are, brown, or, grey, and, a, few, are, cream, colored, all, skunks, are, striped, even, from, birth, they, may, have, a, single, thick, stripe, across, the, back, and, tail, two, thinner, stripes, or, a, series, of, white, spots, and, broken, stripes, in, the, case, of, the, spotted, skunk, skunks, are, crepuscular, and, solitary, animals, when, not, breeding, though, in, the, colder, parts, of, their, range, they, may, gather, in, communal, dens, for, warmth, during, the, day, they, shelter, in, burrows, which, they, can, dig, with, their, powerful, front, claws, for, most, of, the, year, the, normal, home, range, for, skunks, is, 0, 5, to, 2, miles, 1, to, 3, km, in, diameter, with, males, expanding, during, breeding, season, to, travel, 4, to, 5, miles, 6, to, 8, km, per, night, skunks, are, not, true, hibernators, in, the, winter, but, do, den, up, for, extended, periods, of, time, however, they, remain, generally, inactive, and, feed, rarely, going, through, a, dormant, stage, over, winter, multiple, females, as, many, as, 12, huddle, together, males, often, den, alone, often, the, same, winter, den, is, repeatedly, used, although, they, have, excellent, senses, of, smell, and, hearing, they, have, poor, vision, being, unable, to, see, objects, more, than, about, 3, m, 10, ft, away, making, them, vulnerable, to, death, by, road, traffic, they, are, short, lived, their, lifespan, in, the, wild, can, reach, seven, years, with, an, average, of, six, years, in, captivity, they, may, live, for, up, to, 10, years, skunks, mate, in, early, spring, and, are, polygynous, that, is, successful, males, are, uninhibited, from, mating, with, additional, females, before, giving, birth, usually, in, may, the, female, excavates, a, den, to, house, her, litter, of, four, to, seven, kits, skunks, are, placental, with, a, gestation, period, of, about, 66, days, when, born, skunk, kits, are, blind, and, deaf, but, already, covered, by, a, soft, layer, of, fur, about, three, weeks, after, birth, they, first, open, their, eyes, the, kits, are, weaned, about, two, months, after, birth, they, generally, stay, with, their, mother, until, they, are, ready, to, mate, roughly, at, one, year, of, age, the, mother, is, protective, of, her, kits, spraying, at, any, sign, of, danger, the, male, plays, no, part, in, raising, the, young, skunks, are, omnivorous, eating, both, plant, and, animal, material, and, changing, their, diets, as, the, seasons, change, they, eat, insects, larvae, earthworms, grubs, rodents, lizards, salamanders, frogs, snakes, birds, moles, and, eggs, they, also, commonly, eat, berries, roots, leaves, grasses, fungi, and, nuts, in, settled, areas, skunks, also, seek, garbage, left, by, humans, less, often, skunks, may, be, found, acting, as, scavengers, eating, bird, and, rodent, carcasses, left, by, cats, or, other, animals, pet, owners, particularly, those, of, cats, may, experience, a, skunk, finding, its, way, into, a, garage, or, basement, where, pet, food, is, kept, skunks, commonly, dig, holes, in, lawns, in, search, of, grubs, and, worms, skunks, use, their, long, claws, to, break, apart, rotting, logs, to, find, insects, that, live, within, them, they, also, use, those, claws, to, help, dig, for, insects, which, leaves, behind, pits, which, are, easy, signs, of, foraging, the, claws, also, help, with, pinning, down, live, and, active, prey, skunks, are, one, of, the, primary, predators, of, the, honeybee, relying, on, their, thick, fur, to, protect, them, from, stings, the, skunk, scratches, at, the, front, of, the, beehive, and, eats, the, guard, bees, that, come, out, to, investigate, mother, skunks, are, known, to, teach, this, behavior, to, their, young, skunks, are, notorious, for, their, anal, scent, glands, which, they, can, use, as, a, defensive, weapon, they, are, similar, to, though, much, more, developed, than, the, glands, found, in, species, of, the, family, mustelidae, skunks, have, two, glands, one, on, each, side, of, the, anus, these, glands, produce, the, skunk, s, spray, which, is, a, mixture, of, sulfur, containing, chemicals, such, as, thiols, traditionally, called, mercaptans, which, have, an, offensive, odor, the, thiols, also, make, their, spray, highly, flammable, a, skunk, s, spray, is, powerful, enough, to, ward, off, bears, and, other, potential, attackers, muscles, located, next, to, the, scent, glands, allow, them, to, spray, with, a, high, degree, of, accuracy, as, far, as, 3, m, 10, ft, the, spray, can, also, cause, irritation, and, even, temporary, blindness, and, is, sufficiently, powerful, to, be, detected, by, a, human, nose, up, to, 5, 6, km, 3, 5, miles, downwind, their, chemical, defense, is, effective, as, illustrated, by, this, extract, from, charles, darwin, s, 1839, book, the, voyage, of, the, beagle, we, saw, also, a, couple, of, zorrillos, or, skunks, odious, animals, which, are, far, from, uncommon, in, general, appearance, the, zorrillo, resembles, a, polecat, but, it, is, rather, larger, and, much, thicker, in, proportion, conscious, of, its, power, it, roams, by, day, about, the, open, plain, and, fears, neither, dog, nor, man, if, a, dog, is, urged, to, the, attack, its, courage, is, instantly, checked, by, a, few, drops, of, the, fetid, oil, which, brings, on, violent, sickness, and, running, at, the, nose, whatever, is, once, polluted, by, it, is, forever, useless, azara, says, the, smell, can, be, perceived, at, a, league, distance, more, than, once, when, entering, the, harbour, of, monte, video, the, wind, being, offshore, we, have, perceived, the, odour, onboard, the, beagle, certain, it, is, that, every, animal, most, willingly, makes, room, for, the, zorrillo, skunks, carry, just, enough, for, five, or, six, successive, sprays, about, 15, cm, 3, and, require, up, to, ten, days, to, produce, another, supply, their, bold, black, and, white, coloration, makes, their, appearance, memorable, it, is, to, a, skunk, s, advantage, to, warn, possible, predators, off, without, expending, scent, black, and, white, aposematic, warning, coloration, aside, threatened, skunks, will, go, through, an, elaborate, routine, of, hisses, foot, stamping, and, tail, high, deimatic, or, threat, postures, before, resorting, to, spraying, skunks, usually, do, not, spray, other, skunks, except, among, males, in, the, mating, season, if, they, fight, over, den, space, in, autumn, they, do, so, with, teeth, and, claws, most, predators, of, the, americas, such, as, wolves, foxes, and, badgers, seldom, attack, skunks, presumably, out, of, fear, of, being, sprayed, the, exceptions, are, reckless, predators, whose, attacks, fail, once, they, are, sprayed, dogs, and, the, great, horned, owl, which, is, the, skunk, s, only, regular, predator, in, one, case, the, remains, of, 57, striped, skunks, were, found, in, a, single, great, horned, owl, nest, skunks, are, common, in, suburban, areas, and, domestic, dogs, are, often, sprayed, by, skunks, there, are, many, misconceptions, about, the, removal, of, skunk, odor, including, the, pervasive, idea, that, tomato, juice, will, neutralize, the, odor, these, household, remedies, are, ineffective, and, only, appear, to, work, due, to, olfactory, fatigue, in, 1993, the, american, chemist, paul, krebaum, has, developed, a, formula, that, chemically, neutralizes, skunk, spray, by, changing, the, odor, causing, thiols, into, odorless, acids, which, is, endorsed, by, the, humane, society, of, the, united, states, for, sprayed, dogs, it, involves, hydrogen, peroxide, baking, soda, and, liquid, dish, soap, skunk, spray, is, composed, mainly, of, three, low, molecular, weight, thiol, compounds, e, 2, butene, 1, thiol, 3, methyl, 1, butanethiol, and, 2, quinolinemethanethiol, as, well, as, acetate, thioesters, of, these, these, compounds, are, detectable, by, the, human, nose, at, concentrations, of, only, 11, 3, parts, per, billion, it, is, rare, for, a, healthy, skunk, to, bite, a, human, though, a, tame, skunk, whose, scent, glands, have, been, removed, usually, on, behalf, of, those, who, will, keep, it, as, a, pet, may, defend, itself, by, biting, there, are, however, few, recorded, incidents, of, skunks, biting, humans, skunk, bites, in, humans, can, result, in, infection, with, the, rabies, virus, the, centers, for, disease, control, cdc, recorded, 1, 494, cases, of, rabies, in, skunks, in, the, united, states, for, the, year, 2006, about, 21, 5, of, reported, cases, in, all, species, skunks, in, fact, are, less, prominent, than, raccoons, as, vectors, of, rabies, however, this, varies, regionally, in, the, united, states, with, raccoons, dominating, along, the, atlantic, coast, and, the, eastern, gulf, of, mexico, while, skunks, instead, predominate, throughout, the, midwest, including, the, western, gulf, and, in, california, mephitis, mephitis, the, striped, skunk, is, the, most, social, skunk, and, the, one, most, commonly, kept, as, a, pet, in, the, us, skunks, can, legally, be, kept, as, pets, in, 17, states, when, a, skunk, is, kept, as, a, pet, its, scent, glands, are, often, surgically, removed, in, the, uk, skunks, can, be, kept, as, pets, but, the, animal, welfare, act, 2006, made, it, illegal, to, remove, their, scent, glands
