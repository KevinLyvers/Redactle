bleeding, hemorrhage, haemorrhage, or, blood, loss, is, blood, escaping, from, the, circulatory, system, from, damaged, blood, vessels, bleeding, can, occur, internally, or, externally, either, through, a, natural, opening, such, as, the, mouth, nose, ear, urethra, vagina, or, anus, or, through, a, puncture, in, the, skin, hypovolemia, is, a, massive, decrease, in, blood, volume, and, death, by, excessive, loss, of, blood, is, referred, to, as, exsanguination, typically, a, healthy, person, can, endure, a, loss, of, 10, 15, of, the, total, blood, volume, without, serious, medical, difficulties, by, comparison, blood, donation, typically, takes, 8, 10, of, the, donor, s, blood, volume, the, stopping, or, controlling, of, bleeding, is, called, hemostasis, and, is, an, important, part, of, both, first, aid, and, surgery, bleeding, arises, due, to, either, traumatic, injury, underlying, medical, condition, or, a, combination, traumatic, bleeding, is, caused, by, some, type, of, injury, there, are, different, types, of, wounds, which, may, cause, traumatic, bleeding, these, include, the, pattern, of, injury, evaluation, and, treatment, will, vary, with, the, mechanism, of, the, injury, blunt, trauma, causes, injury, via, a, shock, effect, delivering, energy, over, an, area, wounds, are, often, not, straight, and, unbroken, skin, may, hide, significant, injury, penetrating, trauma, follows, the, course, of, the, injurious, device, as, the, energy, is, applied, in, a, more, focused, fashion, it, requires, less, energy, to, cause, significant, injury, any, body, organ, including, bone, and, brain, can, be, injured, and, bleed, bleeding, may, not, be, readily, apparent, internal, organs, such, as, the, liver, kidney, and, spleen, may, bleed, into, the, abdominal, cavity, the, only, apparent, signs, may, come, with, blood, loss, bleeding, from, a, bodily, orifice, such, as, the, rectum, nose, or, ears, may, signal, internal, bleeding, but, cannot, be, relied, upon, bleeding, from, a, medical, procedure, also, falls, into, this, category, medical, bleeding, denotes, hemorrhage, as, a, result, of, an, underlying, medical, condition, i, e, causes, of, bleeding, that, are, not, directly, due, to, trauma, blood, can, escape, from, blood, vessels, as, a, result, of, 3, basic, patterns, of, injury, the, underlying, scientific, basis, for, blood, clotting, and, hemostasis, is, discussed, in, detail, in, the, articles, coagulation, hemostasis, and, related, articles, the, discussion, here, is, limited, to, the, common, practical, aspects, of, blood, clot, formation, which, manifest, as, bleeding, some, medical, conditions, can, also, make, patients, susceptible, to, bleeding, these, are, conditions, that, affect, the, normal, hemostatic, bleeding, control, functions, of, the, body, such, conditions, either, are, or, cause, bleeding, diatheses, hemostasis, involves, several, components, the, main, components, of, the, hemostatic, system, include, platelets, and, the, coagulation, system, platelets, are, small, blood, components, that, form, a, plug, in, the, blood, vessel, wall, that, stops, bleeding, platelets, also, produce, a, variety, of, substances, that, stimulate, the, production, of, a, blood, clot, one, of, the, most, common, causes, of, increased, bleeding, risk, is, exposure, to, nonsteroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, nsaids, the, prototype, for, these, drugs, is, aspirin, which, inhibits, the, production, of, thromboxane, nsaids, for, example, ibuprofen, inhibit, the, activation, of, platelets, and, thereby, increase, the, risk, of, bleeding, the, effect, of, aspirin, is, irreversible, therefore, the, inhibitory, effect, of, aspirin, is, present, until, the, platelets, have, been, replaced, about, ten, days, other, nsaids, such, as, ibuprofen, motrin, and, related, drugs, are, reversible, and, therefore, the, effect, on, platelets, is, not, as, long, lived, there, are, several, named, coagulation, factors, that, interact, in, a, complex, way, to, form, blood, clots, as, discussed, in, the, article, on, coagulation, deficiencies, of, coagulation, factors, are, associated, with, clinical, bleeding, for, instance, deficiency, of, factor, viii, causes, classic, hemophilia, a, while, deficiencies, of, factor, ix, cause, christmas, disease, hemophilia, b, antibodies, to, factor, viii, can, also, inactivate, the, factor, vii, and, precipitate, bleeding, that, is, very, difficult, to, control, this, is, a, rare, condition, that, is, most, likely, to, occur, in, older, patients, and, in, those, with, autoimmune, diseases, another, common, bleeding, disorder, is, von, willebrand, disease, it, is, caused, by, a, deficiency, or, abnormal, function, of, the, von, willebrand, factor, which, is, involved, in, platelet, activation, deficiencies, in, other, factors, such, as, factor, xiii, or, factor, vii, are, occasionally, seen, but, may, not, be, associated, with, severe, bleeding, and, are, not, as, commonly, diagnosed, in, addition, to, nsaid, related, bleeding, another, common, cause, of, bleeding, is, that, related, to, the, medication, warfarin, coumadin, and, others, this, medication, needs, to, be, closely, monitored, as, the, bleeding, risk, can, be, markedly, increased, by, interactions, with, other, medications, warfarin, acts, by, inhibiting, the, production, of, vitamin, k, in, the, gut, vitamin, k, is, required, for, the, production, of, the, clotting, factors, ii, vii, ix, and, x, in, the, liver, one, of, the, most, common, causes, of, warfarin, related, bleeding, is, taking, antibiotics, the, gut, bacteria, make, vitamin, k, and, are, killed, by, antibiotics, this, decreases, vitamin, k, levels, and, therefore, the, production, of, these, clotting, factors, deficiencies, of, platelet, function, may, require, platelet, transfusion, while, deficiencies, of, clotting, factors, may, require, transfusion, of, either, fresh, frozen, plasma, or, specific, clotting, factors, such, as, factor, viii, for, patients, with, hemophilia, infectious, diseases, such, as, ebola, marburg, virus, disease, and, yellow, fever, can, cause, bleeding, dioxaborolane, chemistry, enables, radioactive, fluoride, 18, f, labeling, of, red, blood, cells, which, allows, for, positron, emission, tomography, pet, imaging, of, intracerebral, hemorrhages, hemorrhaging, is, broken, down, into, four, classes, by, the, american, college, of, surgeons, advanced, trauma, life, support, atls, this, system, is, basically, the, same, as, used, in, the, staging, of, hypovolemic, shock, individuals, in, excellent, physical, and, cardiovascular, shape, may, have, more, effective, compensatory, mechanisms, before, experiencing, cardiovascular, collapse, these, patients, may, look, deceptively, stable, with, minimal, derangements, in, vital, signs, while, having, poor, peripheral, perfusion, elderly, patients, or, those, with, chronic, medical, conditions, may, have, less, tolerance, to, blood, loss, less, ability, to, compensate, and, may, take, medications, such, as, betablockers, that, can, potentially, blunt, the, cardiovascular, response, care, must, be, taken, in, the, assessment, although, there, is, no, universally, accepted, definition, of, massive, hemorrhage, the, following, can, be, used, to, identify, the, condition, i, blood, loss, exceeding, circulating, blood, volume, within, a, 24, hour, period, ii, blood, loss, of, 50, of, circulating, blood, volume, within, a, 3, hour, period, iii, blood, loss, exceeding, 150, ml, min, or, iv, blood, loss, that, necessitates, plasma, and, platelet, transfusion, the, world, health, organization, made, a, standardized, grading, scale, to, measure, the, severity, of, bleeding, acute, bleeding, from, an, injury, to, the, skin, is, often, treated, by, the, application, of, direct, pressure, for, severely, injured, patients, tourniquets, are, helpful, in, preventing, complications, of, shock, anticoagulant, medications, may, need, to, be, discontinued, and, possibly, reversed, in, patients, with, clinically, significant, bleeding, patients, that, have, lost, excessive, amounts, of, blood, may, require, a, blood, transfusion, the, use, of, cyanoacrylate, glue, to, prevent, bleeding, and, seal, battle, wounds, was, designed, and, first, used, in, the, vietnam, war, skin, glue, a, medical, version, of, super, glue, is, sometimes, used, instead, of, using, traditional, stitches, used, for, small, wounds, that, need, to, be, closed, at, the, skin, level, the, word, haemorrhage, or, h, morrhage, using, the, ligature, comes, from, latin, haemorrhagia, from, ancient, greek, haimorrhag, a, a, violent, bleeding, from, haimorrhag, s, bleeding, violently, from, ha, ma, blood, rag, a, from, rh, gn, nai, to, break, burst
