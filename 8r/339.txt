corals, are, colonial, marine, invertebrates, within, the, class, anthozoa, of, the, phylum, cnidaria, they, typically, form, compact, colonies, of, many, identical, individual, polyps, coral, species, include, the, important, reef, builders, that, inhabit, tropical, oceans, and, secrete, calcium, carbonate, to, form, a, hard, skeleton, a, coral, group, is, a, colony, of, very, many, genetically, identical, polyps, each, polyp, is, a, sac, like, animal, typically, only, a, few, millimeters, in, diameter, and, a, few, centimeters, in, height, a, set, of, tentacles, surround, a, central, mouth, opening, each, polyp, excretes, an, exoskeleton, near, the, base, over, many, generations, the, colony, thus, creates, a, skeleton, characteristic, of, the, species, which, can, measure, up, to, several, meters, in, size, individual, colonies, grow, by, asexual, reproduction, of, polyps, corals, also, breed, sexually, by, spawning, polyps, of, the, same, species, release, gametes, simultaneously, overnight, often, around, a, full, moon, fertilized, eggs, form, planulae, a, mobile, early, form, of, the, coral, polyp, which, when, mature, settles, to, form, a, new, colony, although, some, corals, are, able, to, catch, plankton, and, small, fish, using, stinging, cells, on, their, tentacles, most, corals, obtain, the, majority, of, their, energy, and, nutrients, from, photosynthetic, unicellular, dinoflagellates, of, the, genus, symbiodinium, that, live, within, their, tissues, these, are, commonly, known, as, zooxanthellae, and, give, the, coral, color, such, corals, require, sunlight, and, grow, in, clear, shallow, water, typically, at, depths, less, than, 60, metres, 200, feet, 33, fathoms, but, corals, in, the, genus, leptoseris, have, been, found, as, deep, as, 172, metres, 564, feet, 94, fathoms, corals, are, major, contributors, to, the, physical, structure, of, the, coral, reefs, that, develop, in, tropical, and, subtropical, waters, such, as, the, great, barrier, reef, off, the, coast, of, australia, these, corals, are, increasingly, at, risk, of, bleaching, events, where, polyps, expel, the, zooxanthellae, in, response, to, stress, such, as, high, water, temperature, or, toxins, other, corals, do, not, rely, on, zooxanthellae, and, can, live, globally, in, much, deeper, water, such, as, the, cold, water, genus, lophelia, which, can, survive, as, deep, as, 3, 300, metres, 10, 800, feet, 1, 800, fathoms, some, have, been, found, as, far, north, as, the, darwin, mounds, northwest, of, cape, wrath, scotland, and, others, off, the, coast, of, washington, state, and, the, aleutian, islands, the, classification, of, corals, has, been, discussed, for, millennia, owing, to, having, similarities, to, both, plants, and, animals, aristotle, s, pupil, theophrastus, described, the, red, coral, korallion, in, his, book, on, stones, implying, it, was, a, mineral, but, he, described, it, as, a, deep, sea, plant, in, his, enquiries, on, plants, where, he, also, mentions, large, stony, plants, that, reveal, bright, flowers, when, under, water, in, the, gulf, of, heroes, pliny, the, elder, stated, boldly, that, several, sea, creatures, including, sea, nettles, and, sponges, are, neither, animals, nor, plants, but, are, possessed, of, a, third, nature, tertia, natura, petrus, gyllius, copied, pliny, introducing, the, term, zoophyta, for, this, third, group, in, his, 1535, book, on, the, french, and, latin, names, of, the, fishes, of, the, marseilles, region, it, is, popularly, but, wrongly, supposed, that, aristotle, created, the, term, gyllius, further, noted, following, aristotle, how, hard, it, was, to, define, what, was, a, plant, and, what, was, an, animal, the, babylonian, talmud, refers, to, coral, among, a, list, of, types, of, trees, and, the, 11th, century, french, commentator, rashi, describes, it, as, a, type, of, tree, that, grows, underwater, that, goes, by, the, french, name, coral, the, persian, polymath, al, biruni, d, 1048, classified, sponges, and, corals, as, animals, arguing, that, they, respond, to, touch, nevertheless, people, believed, corals, to, be, plants, until, the, eighteenth, century, when, william, herschel, used, a, microscope, to, establish, that, coral, had, the, characteristic, thin, cell, membranes, of, an, animal, presently, corals, are, classified, as, species, of, animals, within, the, sub, classes, hexacorallia, and, octocorallia, of, the, class, anthozoa, in, the, phylum, cnidaria, hexacorallia, includes, the, stony, corals, and, these, groups, have, polyps, that, generally, have, a, 6, fold, symmetry, octocorallia, includes, blue, coral, and, soft, corals, and, species, of, octocorallia, have, polyps, with, an, eightfold, symmetry, each, polyp, having, eight, tentacles, and, eight, mesenteries, the, group, of, corals, is, paraphyletic, because, the, sea, anemones, are, also, in, the, sub, class, hexacorallia, the, delineation, of, coral, species, is, challenging, as, hypotheses, based, on, morphological, traits, contradict, hypotheses, formed, via, molecular, tree, based, processes, as, of, 2020, there, are, 2175, identified, separate, coral, species, 237, of, which, are, currently, endangered, making, distinguishing, corals, to, be, the, utmost, of, importance, in, efforts, to, curb, extinction, adaptation, and, delineation, continues, to, occur, in, species, of, coral, in, order, to, combat, the, dangers, posed, by, the, climate, crisis, corals, are, colonial, modular, organisms, formed, by, asexually, produced, and, genetically, identical, modules, called, polyps, polyps, are, connected, by, living, tissue, to, produce, the, full, organism, the, living, tissue, allows, for, inter, module, communication, interaction, between, each, polyp, which, appears, in, colony, morphologies, produced, by, corals, and, is, one, of, the, main, identifying, characteristics, for, a, species, of, coral, there, are, two, main, classifications, for, corals, hard, coral, scleractinian, and, stony, coral, which, form, reefs, by, a, calcium, carbonate, base, with, polyps, that, bear, six, stiff, tentacles, and, soft, coral, alcyonacea, and, ahermatypic, coral, which, are, pliable, and, formed, by, a, colony, of, polyps, with, eight, feather, like, tentacles, these, two, classifications, arose, from, differentiation, in, gene, expressions, in, their, branch, tips, and, bases, that, arose, through, developmental, signaling, pathways, such, as, hox, hedgehog, wnt, bmp, etc, scientists, typically, select, acropora, as, research, models, since, they, are, the, most, diverse, genus, of, hard, coral, having, over, 120, species, most, species, within, this, genus, have, polyps, which, are, dimorphic, axial, polyps, grow, rapidly, and, have, lighter, coloration, while, radial, polyps, are, small, and, are, darker, in, coloration, in, the, acropora, genus, gamete, synthesis, and, photosynthesis, occur, at, the, basal, polyps, growth, occurs, mainly, at, the, radial, polyps, growth, at, the, site, of, the, radial, polyps, encompasses, two, processes, asexual, reproduction, via, mitotic, cell, proliferation, and, skeleton, deposition, of, the, calcium, carbonate, via, extra, cellular, matrix, emc, proteins, acting, as, differentially, expressed, de, signaling, genes, between, both, branch, tips, and, bases, these, processes, lead, to, colony, differentiation, which, is, the, most, accurate, distinguisher, between, coral, species, in, the, acropora, genus, colony, differentiation, through, up, regulation, and, down, regulation, of, des, systematic, studies, of, soft, coral, species, have, faced, challenges, due, to, a, lack, of, taxonomic, knowledge, researchers, have, not, found, enough, variability, within, the, genus, to, confidently, delineate, similar, species, due, to, a, low, rate, in, mutation, of, mitochondrial, dna, environmental, factors, such, as, the, rise, of, temperatures, and, acid, levels, in, our, oceans, account, for, some, speciation, of, corals, in, the, form, of, species, lost, various, coral, species, have, heat, shock, proteins, hsp, that, are, also, in, the, category, of, de, across, species, these, hsps, help, corals, combat, the, increased, temperatures, they, are, facing, which, lead, to, protein, denaturing, growth, loss, and, eventually, coral, death, approximately, 33, of, coral, species, are, on, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, s, endangered, species, list, and, at, risk, of, species, loss, ocean, acidification, falling, ph, levels, in, the, oceans, is, threatening, the, continued, species, growth, and, differentiation, of, corals, mutation, rates, of, vibrio, shilonii, the, reef, pathogen, responsible, for, coral, bleaching, heavily, outweigh, the, typical, reproduction, rates, of, coral, colonies, when, ph, levels, fall, thus, corals, are, unable, to, mutate, their, hsps, and, other, climate, change, preventative, genes, to, combat, the, increase, in, temperature, and, decrease, in, ph, at, a, competitive, rate, to, these, pathogens, responsible, for, coral, bleaching, resulting, in, species, loss, for, most, of, their, life, corals, are, sessile, animals, of, colonies, of, genetically, identical, polyps, each, polyp, varies, from, millimeters, to, centimeters, in, diameter, and, colonies, can, be, formed, from, many, millions, of, individual, polyps, stony, coral, also, known, as, hard, coral, polyps, produce, a, skeleton, composed, of, calcium, carbonate, to, strengthen, and, protect, the, organism, this, is, deposited, by, the, polyps, and, by, the, coenosarc, the, living, tissue, that, connects, them, the, polyps, sit, in, cup, shaped, depressions, in, the, skeleton, known, as, corallites, colonies, of, stony, coral, are, markedly, variable, in, appearance, a, single, species, may, adopt, an, encrusting, plate, like, bushy, columnar, or, massive, solid, structure, the, various, forms, often, being, linked, to, different, types, of, habitat, with, variations, in, light, level, and, water, movement, being, significant, the, body, of, the, polyp, may, be, roughly, compared, in, a, structure, to, a, sac, the, wall, of, which, is, composed, of, two, layers, of, cells, the, outer, layer, is, known, technically, as, the, ectoderm, the, inner, layer, as, the, endoderm, between, ectoderm, and, endoderm, is, a, supporting, layer, of, gelatinous, substance, termed, mesoglea, secreted, by, the, cell, layers, of, the, body, wall, the, mesoglea, can, contain, skeletal, elements, derived, from, cells, migrated, from, the, ectoderm, the, sac, like, body, built, up, in, this, way, is, attached, to, a, hard, surface, which, in, hard, corals, are, cup, shaped, depressions, in, the, skeleton, known, as, corallites, at, the, center, of, the, upper, end, of, the, sac, lies, the, only, opening, called, the, mouth, surrounded, by, a, circle, of, tentacles, which, resemble, glove, fingers, the, tentacles, are, organs, which, serve, both, for, tactile, sense, and, for, the, capture, of, food, polyps, extend, their, tentacles, particularly, at, night, often, containing, coiled, stinging, cells, cnidocytes, which, pierce, poison, and, firmly, hold, living, prey, paralyzing, or, killing, them, polyp, prey, includes, plankton, such, as, copepods, and, fish, larvae, longitudinal, muscular, fibers, formed, from, the, cells, of, the, ectoderm, allow, tentacles, to, contract, to, convey, the, food, to, the, mouth, similarly, circularly, disposed, muscular, fibres, formed, from, the, endoderm, permit, tentacles, to, be, protracted, or, thrust, out, once, they, are, contracted, in, both, stony, and, soft, corals, the, polyps, can, be, retracted, by, contracting, muscle, fibres, with, stony, corals, relying, on, their, hard, skeleton, and, cnidocytes, for, defense, soft, corals, generally, secrete, terpenoid, toxins, to, ward, off, predators, in, most, corals, the, tentacles, are, retracted, by, day, and, spread, out, at, night, to, catch, plankton, and, other, small, organisms, shallow, water, species, of, both, stony, and, soft, corals, can, be, zooxanthellate, the, corals, supplementing, their, plankton, diet, with, the, products, of, photosynthesis, produced, by, these, symbionts, the, polyps, interconnect, by, a, complex, and, well, developed, system, of, gastrovascular, canals, allowing, significant, sharing, of, nutrients, and, symbionts, the, external, form, of, the, polyp, varies, greatly, the, column, may, be, long, and, slender, or, may, be, so, short, in, the, axial, direction, that, the, body, becomes, disk, like, the, tentacles, may, number, many, hundreds, or, may, be, very, few, in, rare, cases, only, one, or, two, they, may, be, simple, and, unbranched, or, feathery, in, pattern, the, mouth, may, be, level, with, the, surface, of, the, peristome, or, may, be, projecting, and, trumpet, shaped, soft, corals, have, no, solid, exoskeleton, as, such, however, their, tissues, are, often, reinforced, by, small, supportive, elements, known, as, sclerites, made, of, calcium, carbonate, the, polyps, of, soft, corals, have, eight, fold, symmetry, which, is, reflected, in, the, octo, in, octocorallia, soft, corals, vary, considerably, in, form, and, most, are, colonial, a, few, soft, corals, are, stolonate, but, the, polyps, of, most, are, connected, by, sheets, of, tissue, called, coenosarc, and, in, some, species, these, sheets, are, thick, and, the, polyps, deeply, embedded, in, them, some, soft, corals, encrust, other, sea, objects, or, form, lobes, others, are, tree, like, or, whip, like, and, have, a, central, axial, skeleton, embedded, at, their, base, in, the, matrix, of, the, supporting, branch, these, branches, are, composed, of, a, fibrous, protein, called, gorgonin, or, of, a, calcified, material, the, polyps, of, stony, corals, have, six, fold, symmetry, in, stony, corals, the, tentacles, are, cylindrical, and, taper, to, a, point, but, in, soft, corals, they, are, pinnate, with, side, branches, known, as, pinnules, in, some, tropical, species, these, are, reduced, to, mere, stubs, and, in, some, they, are, fused, to, give, a, paddle, like, appearance, coral, skeletons, are, biocomposites, mineral, organics, of, calcium, carbonate, in, the, form, of, calcite, or, aragonite, in, scleractinian, corals, centers, of, calcification, and, fibers, are, clearly, distinct, structures, differing, with, respect, to, both, morphology, and, chemical, compositions, of, the, crystalline, units, the, organic, matrices, extracted, from, diverse, species, are, acidic, and, comprise, proteins, sulphated, sugars, and, lipids, they, are, species, specific, the, soluble, organic, matrices, of, the, skeletons, allow, to, differentiate, zooxanthellae, and, non, zooxanthellae, specimens, polyps, feed, on, a, variety, of, small, organisms, from, microscopic, zooplankton, to, small, fish, the, polyp, s, tentacles, immobilize, or, kill, prey, using, stinging, cells, called, nematocysts, these, cells, carry, venom, which, they, rapidly, release, in, response, to, contact, with, another, organism, a, dormant, nematocyst, discharges, in, response, to, nearby, prey, touching, the, trigger, cnidocil, a, flap, operculum, opens, and, its, stinging, apparatus, fires, the, barb, into, the, prey, the, venom, is, injected, through, the, hollow, filament, to, immobilise, the, prey, the, tentacles, then, manoeuvre, the, prey, into, the, stomach, once, the, prey, is, digested, the, stomach, reopens, allowing, the, elimination, of, waste, products, and, the, beginning, of, the, next, hunting, cycle, 24, many, corals, as, well, as, other, cnidarian, groups, such, as, sea, anemones, form, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, a, class, of, dinoflagellate, algae, zooxanthellae, of, the, genus, symbiodinium, which, can, form, as, much, as, 30, of, the, tissue, of, a, polyp, 23, 24, typically, each, polyp, harbors, one, species, of, alga, and, coral, species, show, a, preference, for, symbiodinium, young, corals, are, not, born, with, zooxanthellae, but, acquire, the, algae, from, the, surrounding, environment, including, the, water, column, and, local, sediment, the, main, benefit, of, the, zooxanthellae, is, their, ability, to, photosynthesize, which, supplies, corals, with, the, products, of, photosynthesis, including, glucose, glycerol, also, amino, acids, which, the, corals, can, use, for, energy, zooxanthellae, also, benefit, corals, by, aiding, in, calcification, for, the, coral, skeleton, and, waste, removal, in, addition, to, the, soft, tissue, microbiomes, are, also, found, in, the, coral, s, mucus, and, in, stony, corals, the, skeleton, with, the, latter, showing, the, greatest, microbial, richness, the, zooxanthellae, benefit, from, a, safe, place, to, live, and, consume, the, polyp, s, carbon, dioxide, phosphate, and, nitrogenous, waste, stressed, corals, will, eject, their, zooxanthellae, a, process, that, is, becoming, increasingly, common, due, to, strain, placed, on, coral, by, rising, ocean, temperatures, mass, ejections, are, known, as, coral, bleaching, because, the, algae, contribute, to, coral, coloration, some, colors, however, are, due, to, host, coral, pigments, such, as, green, fluorescent, proteins, gfps, ejection, increases, the, polyp, s, chance, of, surviving, short, term, stress, and, if, the, stress, subsides, they, can, regain, algae, possibly, of, a, different, species, at, a, later, time, if, the, stressful, conditions, persist, the, polyp, eventually, dies, zooxanthellae, are, located, within, the, coral, cytoplasm, and, due, to, the, algae, s, photosynthetic, activity, the, internal, ph, of, the, coral, can, be, raised, this, behavior, indicates, that, the, zooxanthellae, are, responsible, to, some, extent, for, the, metabolism, of, their, host, corals, stony, coral, tissue, loss, disease, has, been, associated, with, the, breakdown, of, host, zooxanthellae, physiology, moreover, vibrio, bacterium, are, known, to, have, virulence, traits, used, for, host, coral, tissue, damage, and, photoinhibition, of, algal, symbionts, therefore, both, coral, and, their, symbiotic, microorganisms, could, have, evolved, to, harbour, traits, resistant, to, disease, and, transmission, corals, can, be, both, gonochoristic, unisexual, and, hermaphroditic, each, of, which, can, reproduce, sexually, and, asexually, reproduction, also, allows, coral, to, settle, in, new, areas, reproduction, is, coordinated, by, chemical, communication, corals, predominantly, reproduce, sexually, about, 25, of, hermatypic, corals, reef, building, stony, corals, form, single, sex, gonochoristic, colonies, while, the, rest, are, hermaphroditic, it, is, estimated, more, than, 67, of, coral, are, simultaneous, hermaphrodites, about, 75, of, all, hermatypic, corals, broadcast, spawn, by, releasing, gametes, eggs, and, sperm, into, the, water, where, they, meet, and, fertilize, to, spread, offspring, corals, often, synchronize, their, time, of, spawning, this, reproductive, synchrony, is, essential, so, that, male, and, female, gametes, can, meet, spawning, frequently, takes, place, in, the, evening, or, at, night, and, can, occur, as, infrequently, as, once, a, year, and, within, a, window, of, 10, 30, minutes, synchronous, spawning, is, very, typical, on, the, coral, reef, and, often, all, corals, spawn, on, the, same, night, even, when, multiple, species, are, present, synchronous, spawning, may, form, hybrids, and, is, perhaps, involved, in, coral, speciation, environmental, cues, that, influence, the, release, of, gametes, into, the, water, vary, from, species, to, species, the, cues, involve, temperature, change, lunar, cycle, day, length, and, possibly, chemical, signalling, other, factors, that, affect, the, rhythmicity, of, organisms, in, marine, habitats, include, salinity, mechanical, forces, and, pressure, or, magnetic, field, changes, mass, coral, spawning, often, occurs, at, night, on, days, following, a, full, moon, a, full, moon, is, equivalent, to, four, to, six, hours, of, continuous, dim, light, exposure, which, can, cause, light, dependent, reactions, in, protein, corals, contain, light, sensitive, cryptochromes, proteins, whose, light, absorbing, flavin, structures, are, sensitive, to, different, types, of, light, this, allows, corals, such, as, dipsastraea, speciosa, to, detect, and, respond, to, changes, in, sunlight, and, moonlight, moonlight, itself, may, actually, suppress, coral, spawning, the, most, immediate, cue, to, cause, spawning, appears, to, be, the, dark, portion, of, the, night, between, sunset, and, moonrise, over, the, lunar, cycle, moonrise, shifts, progressively, later, occurring, after, sunset, on, the, day, of, the, full, moon, the, resulting, dark, period, between, day, light, and, night, light, removes, the, suppressive, effect, of, moonlight, and, enables, coral, to, spawn, the, spawning, event, can, be, visually, dramatic, clouding, the, usually, clear, water, with, gametes, once, released, gametes, fertilize, at, the, water, s, surface, and, form, a, microscopic, larva, called, a, planula, typically, pink, and, elliptical, in, shape, a, typical, coral, colony, needs, to, release, several, thousand, larvae, per, year, to, overcome, the, odds, against, formation, of, a, new, colony, studies, suggest, that, light, pollution, desynchronizes, spawning, in, some, coral, species, in, areas, such, as, the, red, sea, as, many, as, 10, out, of, 50, species, may, be, showing, spawning, asynchrony, compared, to, 30, years, ago, the, establishment, of, new, corals, in, the, area, has, decreased, and, in, some, cases, ceased, the, area, was, previously, considered, a, refuge, for, corals, because, mass, bleaching, events, due, to, climate, change, had, not, been, observed, there, coral, restoration, techniques, for, coral, reef, management, are, being, developed, to, increase, fertilization, rates, larval, development, and, settlement, of, new, corals, brooding, species, are, most, often, ahermatypic, not, reef, building, in, areas, of, high, current, or, wave, action, brooders, release, only, sperm, which, is, negatively, buoyant, sinking, onto, the, waiting, egg, carriers, that, harbor, unfertilized, eggs, for, weeks, synchronous, spawning, events, sometimes, occur, even, with, these, species, after, fertilization, the, corals, release, planula, that, are, ready, to, settle, the, time, from, spawning, to, larval, settlement, is, usually, two, to, three, days, but, can, occur, immediately, or, up, to, two, months, broadcast, spawned, planula, larvae, develop, at, the, water, s, surface, before, descending, to, seek, a, hard, surface, on, the, benthos, to, which, they, can, attach, and, begin, a, new, colony, the, larvae, often, need, a, biological, cue, to, induce, settlement, such, as, specific, crustose, coralline, algae, species, or, microbial, biofilms, high, failure, rates, afflict, many, stages, of, this, process, and, even, though, thousands, of, eggs, are, released, by, each, colony, few, new, colonies, form, during, settlement, larvae, are, inhibited, by, physical, barriers, such, as, sediment, as, well, as, chemical, allelopathic, barriers, the, larvae, metamorphose, into, a, single, polyp, and, eventually, develops, into, a, juvenile, and, then, adult, by, asexual, budding, and, growth, within, a, coral, head, the, genetically, identical, polyps, reproduce, asexually, either, by, budding, gemmation, or, by, dividing, whether, longitudinally, or, transversely, budding, involves, splitting, a, smaller, polyp, from, an, adult, as, the, new, polyp, grows, it, forms, its, body, parts, the, distance, between, the, new, and, adult, polyps, grows, and, with, it, the, coenosarc, the, common, body, of, the, colony, budding, can, be, intratentacular, from, its, oral, discs, producing, same, sized, polyps, within, the, ring, of, tentacles, or, extratentacular, from, its, base, producing, a, smaller, polyp, division, forms, two, polyps, that, each, become, as, large, as, the, original, longitudinal, division, begins, when, a, polyp, broadens, and, then, divides, its, coelenteron, body, effectively, splitting, along, its, length, the, mouth, divides, and, new, tentacles, form, the, two, polyps, thus, created, then, generate, their, missing, body, parts, and, exoskeleton, transversal, division, occurs, when, polyps, and, the, exoskeleton, divide, transversally, into, two, parts, this, means, one, has, the, basal, disc, bottom, and, the, other, has, the, oral, disc, top, the, new, polyps, must, separately, generate, the, missing, pieces, asexual, reproduction, offers, the, benefits, of, high, reproductive, rate, delaying, senescence, and, replacement, of, dead, modules, as, well, as, geographical, distribution, whole, colonies, can, reproduce, asexually, forming, two, colonies, with, the, same, genotype, the, possible, mechanisms, include, fission, bailout, and, fragmentation, fission, occurs, in, some, corals, especially, among, the, family, fungiidae, where, the, colony, splits, into, two, or, more, colonies, during, early, developmental, stages, bailout, occurs, when, a, single, polyp, abandons, the, colony, and, settles, on, a, different, substrate, to, create, a, new, colony, fragmentation, involves, individuals, broken, from, the, colony, during, storms, or, other, disruptions, the, separated, individuals, can, start, new, colonies, corals, are, one, of, the, more, common, examples, of, an, animal, host, whose, symbiosis, with, microalgae, can, turn, to, dysbiosis, and, is, visibly, detected, as, bleaching, coral, microbiomes, have, been, examined, in, a, variety, of, studies, which, demonstrate, how, oceanic, environmental, variations, most, notably, temperature, light, and, inorganic, nutrients, affect, the, abundance, and, performance, of, the, microalgal, symbionts, as, well, as, calcification, and, physiology, of, the, host, studies, have, also, suggested, that, resident, bacteria, archaea, and, fungi, additionally, contribute, to, nutrient, and, organic, matter, cycling, within, the, coral, with, viruses, also, possibly, playing, a, role, in, structuring, the, composition, of, these, members, thus, providing, one, of, the, first, glimpses, at, a, multi, domain, marine, animal, symbiosis, the, gammaproteobacterium, endozoicomonas, is, emerging, as, a, central, member, of, the, coral, s, microbiome, with, flexibility, in,
