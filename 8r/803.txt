the, hippopotamus, hippopotamus, amphibius, h, p, p, t, m, s, pl, hippopotamuses, also, shortened, to, hippo, pl, hippos, further, qualified, as, the, common, hippopotamus, nile, hippopotamus, or, river, hippopotamus, is, a, large, semiaquatic, mammal, native, to, sub, saharan, africa, it, is, one, of, only, two, extant, species, in, the, family, hippopotamidae, the, other, being, the, pygmy, hippopotamus, choeropsis, liberiensis, or, hexaprotodon, liberiensis, its, name, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, for, river, horse, after, elephants, and, rhinoceroses, the, hippopotamus, is, the, next, largest, land, mammal, it, is, also, the, largest, extant, land, artiodactyl, despite, their, physical, resemblance, to, pigs, and, other, terrestrial, even, toed, ungulates, the, closest, living, relatives, of, the, hippopotamids, are, cetaceans, whales, dolphins, porpoises, etc, from, which, they, diverged, about, 55, million, years, ago, hippos, are, recognisable, for, their, barrel, shaped, torsos, wide, opening, mouths, with, large, canine, tusks, nearly, hairless, bodies, pillar, like, legs, and, large, size, adults, average, 1, 500, kg, 3, 300, lb, for, bulls, males, and, 1, 300, kg, 2, 900, lb, for, cows, females, despite, its, stocky, shape, and, short, legs, it, is, capable, of, running, 30, km, h, 19, mph, over, short, distances, hippos, inhabit, rivers, lakes, and, mangrove, swamps, territorial, bulls, each, preside, over, a, stretch, of, water, and, a, group, of, five, to, thirty, cows, and, calves, mating, and, birth, both, occur, in, the, water, during, the, day, hippos, remain, cool, by, staying, in, water, or, mud, emerging, at, dusk, to, graze, on, grasses, while, hippos, rest, near, each, other, in, the, water, grazing, is, a, solitary, activity, and, hippos, typically, do, not, display, territorial, behaviour, on, land, hippos, are, among, the, most, dangerous, animals, in, the, world, due, to, their, aggressive, and, unpredictable, nature, they, are, threatened, by, habitat, loss, and, poaching, for, their, meat, and, ivory, canine, teeth, the, latin, word, hippopotamus, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, hippop, tamos, from, h, ppos, horse, and, potam, s, river, together, meaning, horse, of, the, river, in, english, the, plural, is, hippopotamuses, the, modern, hippopotamus, and, the, pygmy, hippopotamus, are, the, only, living, members, of, the, family, hippopotamidae, some, taxonomists, place, hippos, and, anthracotheres, in, the, superfamily, anthracotheroidea, hippopotamidae, are, classified, along, with, other, even, toed, ungulates, in, the, order, artiodactyla, 39, 40, five, subspecies, of, hippos, have, been, described, based, on, morphological, differences, in, their, skulls, as, well, as, differences, in, geographical, range, 3, the, suggested, subspecies, above, were, never, widely, used, or, validated, by, field, biologists, the, described, morphological, differences, were, small, enough, that, they, could, have, resulted, from, simple, variation, in, nonrepresentative, samples, 2, a, study, examining, mitochondrial, dna, from, skin, biopsies, taken, from, 13, sampling, locations, found, low, but, significant, genetic, differentiation, among, h, a, amphibius, h, a, capensis, and, h, a, kiboko, neither, h, a, tschadensis, nor, h, a, constrictus, have, been, tested, until, 1909, naturalists, classified, hippos, together, with, pigs, based, on, molar, patterns, several, lines, of, evidence, first, from, blood, proteins, then, from, molecular, systematics, dna, and, the, fossil, record, show, their, closest, living, relatives, are, cetaceans, whales, dolphins, and, porpoises, the, common, ancestor, of, hippos, and, whales, branched, off, from, ruminantia, and, the, rest, of, the, even, toed, ungulates, the, cetacean, and, hippo, lineages, split, soon, afterwards, tylopoda, suina, ruminantia, hippopotamidae, cetacea, the, most, recent, theory, of, the, origins, of, hippopotamidae, suggests, hippos, and, whales, shared, a, common, semiaquatic, ancestor, that, branched, off, from, other, artiodactyls, around, 60, million, years, ago, this, hypothesised, ancestral, group, likely, split, into, two, branches, again, around, 54, million, years, ago, one, branch, would, evolve, into, cetaceans, possibly, beginning, about, 52, million, years, ago, with, the, protowhale, pakicetus, and, other, early, whale, ancestors, collectively, known, as, archaeoceti, this, group, eventually, underwent, aquatic, adaptation, into, the, completely, aquatic, cetaceans, the, other, branch, became, the, anthracotheres, a, large, family, of, four, legged, beasts, the, earliest, of, which, in, the, late, eocene, would, have, resembled, skinny, hippos, with, comparatively, smaller, narrower, heads, all, branches, of, the, anthracotheres, except, that, which, evolved, into, hippopotamidae, became, extinct, during, the, pliocene, leaving, no, descendants, a, rough, evolutionary, lineage, of, the, hippo, can, thus, be, traced, from, eocene, and, oligocene, species, from, anthracotherium, and, elomeryx, to, the, miocene, species, merycopotamus, and, libycosaurus, and, finally, the, very, latest, anthracotheres, in, the, pliocene, these, groups, lived, across, eurasia, and, africa, the, discovery, of, epirigenys, in, east, africa, which, was, likely, a, descent, of, asian, anthracotheres, and, a, sister, taxon, to, hippopotamidae, suggests, that, hippo, ancestors, entered, africa, from, asia, around, 35, million, years, ago, an, early, hippopotamid, is, the, genus, kenyapotamus, which, lived, in, africa, from, 15, to, 9, million, years, ago, hippopotamid, species, would, spread, across, africa, and, eurasia, including, the, modern, pygmy, hippo, from, 7, 5, to, 1, 8, million, years, ago, a, possible, ancestor, to, the, modern, hippo, archaeopotamus, lived, in, africa, and, the, middle, east, the, oldest, records, of, the, genus, hippopotamus, date, to, the, pliocene, 5, 3, 2, 6, million, years, ago, the, oldest, unambiguous, records, of, the, modern, h, amphibius, date, to, the, middle, pleistocene, though, there, are, possible, early, pleistocene, records, three, species, of, malagasy, hippopotamus, became, extinct, during, the, holocene, on, madagascar, the, last, of, them, within, the, past, 1, 000, years, the, malagasy, hippos, were, smaller, than, the, modern, hippo, a, likely, result, of, the, process, of, insular, dwarfism, fossil, evidence, indicates, many, malagasy, hippos, were, hunted, by, humans, a, factor, in, their, eventual, extinction, isolated, individual, malagasy, hippos, may, have, survived, in, remote, pockets, in, 1976, villagers, described, a, living, animal, called, the, kilopilopitsofy, which, may, have, been, a, malagasy, hippo, hippopotamus, gorgops, from, the, early, pleistocene, early, middle, pleistocene, of, africa, and, west, asia, grew, considerably, larger, than, the, living, hippopotamus, with, an, estimated, body, mass, of, over, 4, 000, kg, 8, 800, lb, hippopotamus, antiquus, ranged, throughout, europe, extending, as, far, north, as, britain, during, the, early, and, middle, pleistocene, epochs, before, being, replaced, by, the, modern, h, amphibius, in, europe, during, the, latter, part, of, the, middle, pleistocene, the, pleistocene, also, saw, a, number, of, dwarf, species, evolve, on, several, mediterranean, islands, including, crete, hippopotamus, creutzburgi, cyprus, the, cyprus, dwarf, hippopotamus, hippopotamus, minor, malta, hippopotamus, melitensis, and, sicily, hippopotamus, pentlandi, of, these, the, cyprus, dwarf, hippo, survived, until, the, end, of, the, pleistocene, or, early, holocene, evidence, from, the, archaeological, site, aetokremnos, continues, to, cause, debate, on, whether, or, not, the, species, was, driven, to, extinction, or, even, encountered, by, human, the, hippopotamus, is, a, megaherbivore, and, is, exceeded, in, size, among, land, animals, only, by, elephants, and, some, rhinoceros, species, the, mean, adult, weight, is, around, 1, 480, kg, 3, 260, lb, for, bulls, and, 1, 365, kg, 3, 009, lb, for, cows, exceptionally, large, males, have, been, recorded, reaching, 2, 660, kg, 5, 860, lb, male, hippos, appear, to, continue, growing, throughout, their, lives, while, females, reach, maximum, weight, at, around, age, 25, it, is, 2, 90, to, 5, 05, m, 9, ft, 6, in, to, 16, ft, 7, in, long, including, a, tail, of, about, 35, to, 56, cm, 14, to, 22, in, in, length, and, 1, 30, to, 1, 65, m, 4, ft, 3, in, to, 5, ft, 5, in, tall, at, the, shoulder, with, males, and, females, ranging, 1, 40, to, 1, 65, m, 4, ft, 7, in, to, 5, ft, 5, in, and, 1, 30, to, 1, 45, m, 4, ft, 3, in, to, 4, ft, 9, in, tall, at, the, shoulder, respectively, the, species, has, a, typical, head, body, length, of, 3, 3, 3, 45, m, 10, 8, 11, 3, ft, and, an, average, standing, height, of, 1, 4, m, 4, ft, 7, in, at, the, shoulder, hippos, have, barrel, shaped, bodies, with, short, tails, and, legs, and, an, hourglass, shaped, skull, with, a, long, snout, 3, 19, their, skeletal, structures, are, graviportal, adapted, to, carrying, their, enormous, weight, 8, and, their, dense, bones, and, low, centre, of, gravity, allows, them, to, sink, and, move, along, the, bottom, of, the, water, hippopotamuses, have, small, legs, relative, to, other, megafauna, because, the, water, in, which, they, live, reduces, the, weight, burden, the, toes, are, webbed, and, the, pelvis, rests, at, an, angle, of, 45, degrees, 3, 9, though, chubby, looking, hippos, have, little, fat, 3, the, eyes, ears, and, nostrils, of, hippos, are, placed, high, on, the, roof, of, their, skulls, this, allows, these, organs, to, remain, above, the, surface, while, the, rest, of, the, body, is, submerged, 259, the, nostrils, and, ears, can, close, when, underwater, while, nictitating, membranes, cover, the, eyes, 4, 116, the, vocal, folds, of, the, hippo, are, more, horizontally, positioned, much, like, cetaceans, underneath, are, throat, tissues, where, vibrations, are, transmitted, to, produce, underwater, calls, the, hippo, s, jaw, is, powered, by, huge, masseter, and, digastric, muscles, which, give, them, large, droopy, cheeks, 259, the, jaw, hinge, allows, the, animal, to, open, its, mouth, at, almost, 180, 17, a, folded, orbicularis, oris, muscle, allows, the, hippo, to, attain, an, extreme, gape, without, tearing, any, tissue, on, the, lower, jaw, the, incisors, and, canines, grow, continuously, the, former, reaching, 40, cm, 16, in, while, the, latter, can, grow, to, up, to, 50, cm, 20, in, the, lower, canines, are, sharpened, through, contact, with, the, smaller, upper, canines, the, canines, and, incisors, are, used, mainly, for, combat, instead, of, feeding, hippos, rely, on, their, flattened, horny, lips, to, grasp, and, pull, grasses, which, are, then, ground, by, the, molars, 259, 263, the, hippo, is, considered, to, be, a, pseudoruminant, it, has, a, complex, three, chambered, stomach, but, does, not, chew, cud, 22, hippo, skin, is, 6, cm, 2, 4, in, thick, across, much, of, its, body, with, little, hair, 260, the, animal, is, mostly, purplish, grey, or, blue, black, but, brownish, pink, on, the, underside, and, around, the, eyes, and, ears, 260, their, skin, secretes, a, natural, red, coloured, sunscreen, substance, that, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, blood, sweat, but, is, neither, blood, nor, sweat, this, secretion, is, initially, colourless, and, turns, red, orange, within, minutes, eventually, becoming, brown, two, highly, acidic, pigments, have, been, identified, in, the, secretions, one, red, hipposudoric, acid, and, one, orange, norhipposudoric, acid, which, inhibit, the, growth, of, disease, causing, bacteria, and, their, light, absorption, profile, peaks, in, the, ultraviolet, range, creating, a, sunscreen, effect, regardless, of, diet, all, hippos, secrete, these, pigments, so, food, does, not, appear, to, be, their, source, rather, they, may, be, synthesised, from, precursors, such, as, the, amino, acid, tyrosine, this, natural, sunscreen, cannot, prevent, the, animal, s, skin, from, cracking, if, it, stays, out, of, water, too, long, the, testes, of, the, males, do, not, fully, descend, and, a, scrotum, is, not, present, in, addition, the, penis, retracts, into, the, body, when, not, erect, the, genitals, of, the, female, hippos, are, unusual, in, that, the, vagina, is, ridged, and, the, vulval, vestibule, has, two, large, protruding, diverticula, both, of, these, have, an, unknown, function, 28, 29, a, hippo, s, lifespan, is, typically, 40, to, 50, years, 277, donna, the, hippo, was, one, of, the, oldest, living, hippos, in, captivity, she, lived, at, the, mesker, park, zoo, in, evansville, indiana, in, the, us, until, her, death, in, 2012, at, the, age, of, 61, the, oldest, hippo, ever, recorded, was, called, bertha, she, had, lived, in, the, manila, zoo, in, the, philippines, since, it, first, opened, in, 1959, when, she, died, in, 2017, her, age, was, estimated, to, be, 65, the, oldest, living, hippopotamus, in, captivity, is, lu, the, hippo, from, the, ellie, schiller, homosassa, springs, wildlife, state, park, as, of, 2024, he, is, 64, years, old, hippopotamus, amphibius, arrived, in, europe, around, 560, 460, 000, years, ago, during, the, middle, pleistocene, the, distribution, of, hippopotamus, amphibius, in, europe, during, the, pleistocene, was, largely, confined, to, southern, europe, including, the, iberian, peninsula, italy, and, greece, but, extended, into, northwestern, europe, including, great, britain, as, far, north, as, north, yorkshire, the, netherlands, and, western, germany, during, interglacial, periods, such, as, the, last, interglacial, 130, 115, 000, years, ago, the, youngest, records, of, the, species, in, europe, are, from, the, late, pleistocene, of, greece, dating, to, around, 40, 30, 000, years, ago, archaeological, evidence, exists, of, its, presence, in, the, levant, dating, to, less, than, 3, 000, years, ago, the, species, was, common, in, egypt, s, nile, region, during, antiquity, but, it, has, since, been, driven, out, according, to, pliny, the, elder, in, his, time, the, best, location, in, egypt, for, capturing, this, animal, was, in, the, saite, nome, the, animal, could, still, be, found, along, the, damietta, branch, of, the, nile, after, the, arab, conquest, in, 639, reports, of, the, slaughter, of, the, last, hippo, in, natal, province, were, made, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, hippos, are, still, found, in, the, rivers, and, lakes, of, the, northern, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, uganda, tanzania, and, kenya, north, through, to, ethiopia, somalia, and, sudan, west, to, the, gambia, and, south, to, south, africa, genetic, evidence, suggests, common, hippos, in, africa, experienced, a, marked, population, expansion, during, or, after, the, pleistocene, attributed, to, an, increase, in, water, bodies, at, the, end, of, the, era, these, findings, have, important, conservation, implications, as, hippo, populations, across, the, continent, are, currently, threatened, by, loss, of, access, to, fresh, water, hippos, are, also, subject, to, unregulated, hunting, and, poaching, the, species, is, included, in, appendix, ii, of, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, cites, meaning, international, export, import, including, in, parts, and, derivatives, requires, cites, documentation, to, be, obtained, and, presented, to, border, authorities, as, of, 2017, the, iucn, red, list, drawn, up, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, lists, the, species, as, vulnerable, with, a, stable, population, estimated, between, 115, 000, and, 130, 000, animals, the, hippo, population, has, declined, most, dramatically, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, by, 2005, the, population, in, virunga, national, park, had, dropped, to, 800, or, 900, from, around, 29, 000, in, the, mid, 1970s, this, decline, is, attributed, to, the, disruptions, caused, by, the, second, congo, war, the, poachers, are, believed, to, be, mai, mai, rebels, underpaid, congolese, soldiers, and, local, militia, groups, reasons, for, poaching, include, the, belief, hippos, are, harmful, to, society, as, well, as, financial, gain, as, of, 2016, the, virunga, hippo, population, appears, to, have, increased, again, possibly, due, to, better, protection, from, park, rangers, who, have, worked, with, local, fishermen, the, sale, of, hippo, meat, is, illegal, but, black, market, sales, are, difficult, for, virunga, national, park, officers, to, track, hippo, meat, is, highly, valued, in, some, areas, of, central, africa, and, the, teeth, may, be, used, as, a, replacement, for, elephant, ivory, a, population, of, hippos, exists, in, colombia, descended, from, captive, individuals, that, escaped, from, pablo, escobar, s, estate, after, his, death, in, 1993, their, numbers, grew, to, 100, by, the, 2020s, and, ecologists, believe, the, population, should, be, eradicated, as, they, are, breeding, rapidly, and, are, an, increasing, menace, to, humans, and, the, environment, attempts, to, control, them, include, sterilisation, and, culling, hippos, are, semiaquatic, and, require, enough, water, to, immerse, in, while, being, close, to, grass, they, mostly, live, in, freshwater, habitat, but, can, be, found, in, estuaries, they, prefer, relatively, still, waters, with, gently, sloping, shores, though, male, hippos, may, also, be, found, in, very, small, numbers, in, more, rapid, waters, with, rocky, slopes, 264, like, most, herbivores, hippos, will, consume, a, variety, of, plants, if, presented, with, them, in, captivity, but, their, diet, in, nature, consists, almost, entirely, of, grass, with, only, minimal, consumption, of, aquatic, plants, hippos, spend, most, of, the, day, in, water, to, stay, cool, and, hydrated, just, before, night, begins, they, leave, the, water, to, forage, on, land, a, hippo, will, travel, 3, 5, km, 1, 9, 3, 1, mi, per, night, eating, around, 40, kg, 88, lb, of, grass, by, dawn, they, are, back, in, the, water, despite, being, semiaquatic, an, adult, hippo, is, not, a, particularly, good, swimmer, nor, can, it, float, it, rarely, enters, deep, water, when, it, does, the, animal, moves, by, bouncing, off, the, bottom, an, adult, hippo, surfaces, every, four, to, six, minutes, while, young, need, to, breathe, every, two, to, three, minutes, 3, 4, hippos, move, on, land, by, trotting, and, limb, movements, do, not, change, between, speeds, they, can, reach, an, airborne, stage, a, stage, when, all, limb, are, off, the, ground, when, they, move, fast, enough, hippos, are, reported, to, reach, 30, km, h, 19, mph, but, this, has, not, been, confirmed, they, are, incapable, of, jumping, but, can, walk, up, steep, banks, the, hippopotamus, sleeps, with, both, hemispheres, of, the, brain, resting, as, in, all, land, mammals, and, usually, sleeps, on, land, or, in, water, with, the, nostrils, exposed, despite, this, it, may, be, capable, of, sleeping, while, submerged, intermittently, surfacing, to, breathe, without, waking, they, appear, to, transition, between, different, phases, of, sleep, more, quickly, than, other, mammals, because, of, their, size, and, their, habit, of, taking, the, same, paths, to, feed, hippos, can, have, a, significant, impact, on, the, land, across, which, they, walk, keeping, the, land, clear, of, vegetation, and, depressing, the, ground, over, prolonged, periods, hippos, can, divert, the, paths, of, swamps, and, channels, by, defecating, in, the, water, the, animals, also, appear, to, pass, on, microbes, from, their, gut, affecting, the, biogeochemical, cycle, on, occasion, hippos, have, been, filmed, eating, carrion, usually, near, the, water, there, are, other, reports, of, meat, eating, and, even, cannibalism, and, predation, hippos, stomach, anatomy, lacks, adaptions, to, carnivory, and, meat, eating, is, likely, caused, by, lack, of, nutrients, or, just, an, abnormal, behaviour, 82, 84, it, is, challenging, to, study, the, interaction, of, bulls, and, cows, because, hippos, are, not, sexually, dimorphic, so, cows, and, young, bulls, are, almost, indistinguishable, in, the, field, hippo, pods, fluctuate, but, can, contain, over, 100, hippos, although, they, lie, close, together, adults, develop, almost, no, social, bonds, males, establish, territories, in, water, but, not, land, and, these, may, range, 250, 500, m, 820, 1, 640, ft, in, lakes, and, 50, 100, m, 160, 330, ft, in, rivers, territories, are, abandoned, when, the, water, dries, up, the, bull, has, breeding, access, to, all, the, cows, in, his, territory, younger, bachelors, are, allowed, to, stay, as, long, as, they, defer, to, him, a, younger, male, may, challenge, the, old, bull, for, control, of, the, territory, within, the, pods, the, hippos, tend, to, segregate, by, sex, and, status, bachelor, males, lounge, near, other, bachelors, females, with, other, females, and, the, territorial, male, is, on, his, own, when, hippos, emerge, from, the, water, to, graze, they, do, so, individually, 4, 5, 49, 50, hippos, engage, in, muck, spreading, which, involves, defecating, while, spinning, their, tails, to, distribute, the, faeces, over, a, greater, area, muck, spreading, occurs, both, on, land, and, in, water, and, its, function, is, not, well, understood, it, is, unlikely, to, serve, a, territorial, function, as, the, animals, only, establish, territories, in, the, water, they, may, be, used, as, trails, between, the, water, and, grazing, areas, 5, 51, 52, yawning, serves, as, a, threat, display, when, fighting, bulls, use, their, incisors, to, block, each, other, s, attacks, and, their, large, canines, as, offensive, weapons, 259, 260, when, hippos, become, over, populated, or, a, habitat, shrinks, bulls, sometimes, attempt, infanticide, but, this, behaviour, is, not, common, under, normal, conditions, the, most, common, hippo, vocalisation, is, the, wheeze, honk, which, can, travel, over, long, distances, in, air, this, call, starts, as, a, high, pitched, squeal, followed, by, a, deeper, resonant, call, 5, the, animals, can, recognise, the, calls, of, other, individuals, hippos, are, more, likely, to, react, to, the, wheeze, honks, of, strangers, than, to, those, they, are, more, familiar, with, when, threatened, or, alarmed, they, produce, exhalations, and, fighting, bulls, will, bellow, loudly, 5, hippos, are, recorded, to, produce, clicks, underwater, which, may, have, echolocative, properties, they, have, the, unique, ability, to, hold, their, heads, partially, above, the, water, and, send, out, a, cry, that, travels, through, both, water, and, air, individuals, respond, both, above, and, below, water, cows, reach, sexual, maturity, at, five, to, six, years, of, age, and, have, a, gestation, period, of, eight, months, a, study, of, endocrine, systems, revealed, cows, may, begin, puberty, at, as, early, as, three, or, four, years, bulls, reach, maturity, at, around, 7, 5, years, both, conceptions, and, births, are, highest, during, the, wet, season, male, hippos, always, have, mobile, spermatozoa, and, can, breed, year, round, 59, 61, 66, after, becoming, pregnant, a, female, hippo, will, typically, not, begin, ovulation, again, for, 17, months, hippos, mate, in, the, water, with, the, cow, remaining, under, the, surface, 63, her, head, emerging, periodically, to, draw, breath, cows, give, birth, in, seclusion, and, return, within, 10, to, 14, days, calves, are, born, on, land, or, shallow, water, weighing, on, average, 50, kg, 110, lb, and, at, an, average, length, of, around,
