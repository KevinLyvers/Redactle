see, text, columbidae, k, l, m, b, d, i, k, lum, bih, dee, is, a, bird, family, consisting, of, doves, and, pigeons, it, is, the, only, family, in, the, order, columbiformes, these, are, stout, bodied, birds, with, short, necks, and, short, slender, bills, that, in, some, species, feature, fleshy, ceres, they, primarily, feed, on, plants, and, can, be, taxonomically, divided, amongst, granivores, that, feed, mostly, on, the, ground, on, seeds, and, frugivores, that, feed, mostly, on, fruits, from, branches, the, family, occurs, worldwide, often, in, close, proximity, with, humans, but, the, greatest, variety, is, in, the, indomalayan, and, australasian, realms, columbidae, contains, 344, species, divided, into, 50, genera, fifty, nine, species, are, listed, as, threatened, and, thirteen, are, extinct, including, the, dodo, an, island, bird, and, the, passenger, pigeon, the, only, bird, species, not, restricted, to, a, small, island, to, go, extinct, in, modern, times, even, though, its, flocks, were, counted, in, the, billions, in, colloquial, english, the, smaller, species, tend, to, be, called, doves, and, the, larger, ones, pigeons, although, the, distinction, is, not, consistent, and, there, is, no, scientific, separation, between, them, historically, the, common, names, for, these, birds, involve, a, great, deal, of, variation, the, bird, most, commonly, referred, to, as, pigeon, is, the, domestic, pigeon, or, rock, dove, which, is, common, in, many, cities, as, the, feral, pigeon, doves, and, pigeons, build, relatively, flimsy, nests, often, using, sticks, and, other, debris, which, may, be, placed, on, branches, of, trees, on, ledges, or, on, the, ground, depending, on, species, they, lay, one, or, usually, two, white, eggs, at, a, time, and, both, parents, care, for, the, young, unlike, most, birds, both, sexes, of, doves, and, pigeons, produce, crop, milk, to, feed, to, their, young, secreted, by, a, sloughing, of, fluid, filled, cells, from, the, lining, of, the, crop, unfledged, baby, doves, and, pigeons, are, called, squabs, and, are, generally, able, to, fly, by, 5, weeks, of, age, these, fledglings, with, their, immature, squeaking, voices, are, called, squeakers, once, they, are, weaned, and, leave, the, nest, after, 25, 32, days, since, ancient, times, many, columbidae, species, have, developed, intricate, cultural, and, practical, relations, with, humans, doves, were, important, symbols, of, the, goddesses, innana, asherah, and, aphrodite, and, revered, by, the, early, christian, islamic, and, jewish, religions, domestication, of, pigeons, led, to, significant, use, of, homing, pigeons, for, communication, including, war, pigeons, such, as, the, 32, pigeons, who, were, awarded, the, dickin, medal, for, brave, service, to, their, country, in, world, war, ii, pigeon, is, a, french, word, that, derives, from, the, latin, p, pi, for, a, peeping, chick, while, dove, is, an, ultimately, germanic, word, that, refers, to, the, bird, s, diving, flight, the, english, dialectal, word, culver, appears, to, derive, from, latin, columba, a, group, of, doves, is, called, a, dule, taken, from, the, french, word, deuil, mourning, columbiformes, is, one, of, the, most, diverse, non, passerine, clades, of, neoavians, and, its, origins, are, in, the, cretaceous, and, the, result, of, a, rapid, diversification, at, the, end, of, the, k, pg, boundary, whole, genome, analyses, have, found, the, columbiformes, form, a, sister, clade, of, a, group, conformed, by, the, sandgrouses, pterocliformes, and, mesites, mesitornithiformes, the, name, columbidae, for, the, family, was, introduced, by, the, english, zoologist, william, elford, leach, in, a, guide, to, the, contents, of, the, british, museum, published, in, 1819, columbidae, is, the, only, living, family, in, the, order, columbiformes, the, sandgrouse, pteroclidae, were, formerly, placed, here, but, were, moved, to, a, separate, order, pterocliformes, based, on, anatomical, differences, such, as, the, inability, to, drink, by, sucking, or, pumping, the, columbidae, are, usually, divided, into, five, subfamilies, probably, inaccurately, for, example, the, american, ground, and, quail, doves, geotrygon, which, are, usually, placed, in, the, columbinae, seem, to, be, two, distinct, subfamilies, the, order, presented, here, follows, baptista, et, al, 1997, with, some, updates, the, arrangement, of, genera, and, naming, of, subfamilies, is, in, some, cases, provisional, because, analyses, of, different, dna, sequences, yield, results, that, differ, often, radically, in, the, placement, of, certain, mainly, indo, australian, genera, this, ambiguity, probably, caused, by, long, branch, attraction, seems, to, confirm, the, first, pigeons, evolved, in, the, australasian, region, and, that, the, treronidae, and, allied, forms, crowned, and, pheasant, pigeons, for, example, represent, the, earliest, radiation, of, the, group, the, family, columbidae, previously, also, contained, the, family, raphidae, consisting, of, the, extinct, rodrigues, solitaire, and, the, dodo, these, species, are, in, all, likelihood, part, of, the, indo, australian, radiation, that, produced, the, three, small, subfamilies, mentioned, above, with, the, fruit, doves, and, pigeons, including, the, nicobar, pigeon, therefore, they, are, here, included, as, a, subfamily, raphinae, pending, better, material, evidence, of, their, exact, relationships, these, taxonomic, issues, are, exacerbated, by, columbids, not, being, well, represented, in, the, fossil, record, with, no, truly, primitive, forms, having, been, found, to, date, the, genus, gerandia, has, been, described, from, early, miocene, deposits, in, france, but, while, it, was, long, believed, to, be, a, pigeon, it, is, now, considered, a, sandgrouse, fragmentary, remains, of, a, probably, ptilinopine, early, miocene, pigeon, were, found, in, the, bannockburn, formation, of, new, zealand, and, described, as, rupephaps, columbina, prattae, from, roughly, contemporary, deposits, of, florida, is, nowadays, tentatively, separated, in, arenicolumba, but, its, distinction, from, columbina, scardafella, and, related, genera, needs, to, be, more, firmly, established, e, g, by, cladistic, analysis, apart, from, that, all, other, fossils, belong, to, extant, genera, fossil, species, of, uncertain, placement, pigeons, and, doves, exhibit, considerable, variation, in, size, ranging, in, length, from, 15, to, 75, centimetres, 5, 9, to, 29, 5, in, and, in, weight, from, 30, g, 0, 066, lb, to, above, 2, 000, g, 4, 4, lb, the, largest, species, is, the, crowned, pigeon, of, new, guinea, which, is, nearly, turkey, sized, at, a, weight, of, 2, 4, kg, 4, 4, 8, 8, lb, the, smallest, is, the, common, ground, dove, columbina, passerina, of, the, genus, columbina, which, is, the, same, size, as, a, house, sparrow, weighing, as, little, as, 22, g, 0, 049, lb, the, dwarf, fruit, dove, which, may, measure, as, little, as, 13, cm, 5, 1, in, has, a, marginally, smaller, total, length, than, any, other, species, from, this, family, one, of, the, largest, arboreal, species, the, marquesan, imperial, pigeon, currently, battles, extinction, overall, the, anatomy, of, columbidae, is, characterized, by, short, legs, short, bills, with, a, fleshy, cere, and, small, heads, on, large, compact, bodies, like, some, other, birds, the, columbidae, have, no, gall, bladders, some, medieval, naturalists, concluded, they, have, no, bile, gall, which, in, the, medieval, theory, of, the, four, humours, explained, the, allegedly, sweet, disposition, of, doves, in, fact, however, they, do, have, bile, as, aristotle, had, earlier, realized, which, is, secreted, directly, into, the, gut, the, wings, are, large, and, have, eleven, primary, feathers, pigeons, have, strong, wing, muscles, wing, muscles, comprise, 31, 44, of, their, body, weight, and, are, among, the, strongest, fliers, of, all, birds, in, a, series, of, experiments, in, 1975, by, dr, mark, b, friedman, using, doves, their, characteristic, head, bobbing, was, shown, to, be, due, to, their, natural, desire, to, keep, their, vision, constant, it, was, shown, yet, again, in, a, 1978, experiment, by, dr, barrie, j, frost, in, which, pigeons, were, placed, on, treadmills, it, was, observed, that, they, did, not, bob, their, heads, as, their, surroundings, were, constant, columbidae, have, unique, body, feathers, with, the, shaft, being, generally, broad, strong, and, flattened, tapering, to, a, fine, point, abruptly, in, general, the, aftershaft, is, absent, however, small, ones, on, some, tail, and, wing, feathers, may, be, present, body, feathers, have, very, dense, fluffy, bases, are, attached, loosely, into, the, skin, and, drop, out, easily, possibly, serving, as, a, predator, avoidance, mechanism, large, numbers, of, feathers, fall, out, in, the, attacker, s, mouth, if, the, bird, is, snatched, facilitating, the, bird, s, escape, the, plumage, of, the, family, is, variable, granivorous, species, tend, to, have, dull, plumage, with, a, few, exceptions, whereas, the, frugivorous, species, have, brightly, coloured, plumage, the, ptilinopus, fruit, doves, are, some, of, the, brightest, coloured, pigeons, with, the, three, endemic, species, of, fiji, and, the, indian, ocean, alectroenas, being, the, brightest, pigeons, and, doves, may, be, sexually, monochromatic, or, dichromatic, in, addition, to, bright, colours, pigeons, may, sport, crests, or, other, ornamentation, columbidae, are, excellent, fliers, due, to, the, lift, provided, by, their, large, wings, which, results, in, low, wing, loading, they, are, highly, maneuverable, in, flight, and, have, a, low, aspect, ratio, due, to, the, width, of, their, wings, allowing, for, quick, flight, launches, and, ability, to, escape, from, predators, but, at, a, high, energy, cost, pigeons, and, doves, are, distributed, everywhere, on, earth, except, for, the, driest, areas, of, the, sahara, desert, antarctica, and, its, surrounding, islands, and, the, high, arctic, they, have, colonized, most, of, the, world, s, oceanic, islands, reaching, eastern, polynesia, and, the, chatham, islands, in, the, pacific, mauritius, the, seychelles, and, r, union, in, the, indian, ocean, and, the, azores, in, the, atlantic, ocean, the, family, has, adapted, to, most, of, the, habitats, available, on, the, planet, these, species, may, be, arboreal, terrestrial, or, semi, terrestrial, various, species, also, inhabit, savanna, grassland, desert, temperate, woodland, and, forest, mangrove, forest, and, even, the, barren, sands, and, gravels, of, atolls, some, species, have, large, natural, ranges, the, eared, dove, ranges, across, the, entirety, of, south, america, from, colombia, to, tierra, del, fuego, the, eurasian, collared, dove, has, a, massive, if, discontinuous, distribution, from, britain, across, europe, the, middle, east, india, pakistan, and, china, and, the, laughing, dove, across, most, of, sub, saharan, africa, as, well, as, india, pakistan, and, the, middle, east, the, largest, range, of, any, species, is, that, of, the, rock, dove, also, known, as, the, common, pigeon, this, species, had, a, large, natural, distribution, from, britain, and, ireland, to, northern, africa, across, europe, arabia, central, asia, india, the, himalayas, and, up, into, china, and, mongolia, the, range, of, the, species, increased, dramatically, upon, domestication, as, the, species, went, feral, in, cities, around, the, world, the, common, pigeon, is, currently, resident, across, most, of, north, america, and, has, established, itself, in, cities, and, urban, areas, in, south, america, sub, saharan, africa, southeast, asia, japan, australia, and, new, zealand, as, well, as, the, rock, dove, several, other, species, of, pigeon, have, become, established, outside, of, their, natural, range, after, escaping, captivity, and, other, species, have, increased, their, natural, ranges, due, to, habitat, changes, caused, by, human, activity, a, 2020, study, found, that, the, east, coast, of, the, u, s, includes, two, pigeon, genetic, megacities, in, new, york, and, boston, and, observes, that, the, birds, do, not, mix, together, other, species, of, columbidae, have, tiny, restricted, distributions, usually, seen, on, small, islands, such, as, the, whistling, dove, which, is, endemic, to, the, tiny, kadavu, island, in, fiji, the, caroline, ground, dove, restricted, to, two, islands, truk, and, pohnpei, in, the, caroline, islands, and, the, grenada, dove, which, is, only, found, on, the, island, of, grenada, in, the, caribbean, some, continental, species, also, have, tiny, distributions, such, as, the, black, banded, fruit, dove, which, is, restricted, to, a, small, area, of, the, arnhem, land, of, australia, the, somali, pigeon, found, only, in, a, tiny, area, of, northern, somalia, and, moreno, s, ground, dove, endemic, to, the, area, around, salta, and, tucuman, in, northern, argentina, seeds, and, fruit, form, the, major, component, of, the, diets, of, pigeons, and, doves, and, the, family, can, be, divided, between, the, seed, eating, or, granivorous, species, subfamily, columbinae, and, the, fruit, and, mast, eating, or, frugivorous, species, which, make, up, the, other, four, subfamilies, the, granivorous, species, typically, feed, on, seed, found, on, the, ground, whereas, the, frugivorous, species, tend, to, feed, in, trees, the, morphological, adaptations, used, to, distinguish, between, the, two, groups, include, granivores, tending, to, having, thick, walls, in, their, gizzards, intestines, and, esophagi, with, the, frugivores, evolved, with, thin, walls, and, the, fruit, eating, species, have, short, intestines, as, opposed, to, the, seed, eaters, having, longer, intestines, frugivores, are, capable, of, clinging, to, branches, and, even, hang, upside, down, to, reach, fruit, in, addition, to, fruit, and, seeds, a, number, of, other, food, items, are, taken, by, many, species, some, particularly, the, ground, doves, and, quail, doves, eat, a, large, number, of, prey, items, such, as, insects, and, worms, one, species, the, atoll, fruit, dove, is, specialised, in, taking, insect, and, reptile, prey, snails, moths, and, other, insects, are, taken, by, white, crowned, pigeons, orange, fruit, doves, and, ruddy, ground, doves, urban, feral, pigeons, descendants, of, domestic, rock, doves, columbia, livia, reside, in, urban, environments, disturbing, their, natural, feeding, habits, they, depend, on, human, activities, and, interactions, to, obtain, food, causing, them, to, forage, for, spilled, food, or, food, provided, by, humans, while, many, species, of, pigeons, and, doves, have, benefited, from, human, activities, and, have, increased, their, ranges, many, other, species, have, declined, in, numbers, and, some, have, become, threatened, or, even, succumbed, to, extinction, among, the, ten, species, to, have, become, extinct, since, 1600, the, conventional, date, for, estimating, modern, extinctions, are, two, of, the, most, famous, extinct, species, the, dodo, and, the, passenger, pigeon, the, passenger, pigeon, was, exceptional, for, a, number, of, reasons, in, modern, times, it, is, the, only, pigeon, species, that, was, not, an, island, species, to, have, become, extinct, even, though, it, was, once, the, most, numerous, species, of, bird, on, earth, its, former, numbers, are, difficult, to, estimate, but, one, ornithologist, alexander, wilson, estimated, one, flock, he, observed, contained, over, two, billion, birds, the, decline, of, the, species, was, abrupt, in, 1871, a, breeding, colony, was, estimated, to, contain, over, a, hundred, million, birds, yet, the, last, individual, in, the, species, was, dead, by, 1914, although, habitat, loss, was, a, contributing, factor, the, species, is, thought, to, have, been, massively, over, hunted, being, used, as, food, for, slaves, and, later, the, poor, in, the, united, states, throughout, the, 19th, century, the, dodo, and, its, extinction, was, more, typical, of, the, extinctions, of, pigeons, in, the, past, like, many, species, that, colonise, remote, islands, with, few, predators, it, lost, much, of, its, predator, avoidance, behaviour, along, with, its, ability, to, fly, the, arrival, of, people, along, with, a, suite, of, other, introduced, species, such, as, rats, pigs, and, cats, quickly, spelled, the, end, for, this, species, and, all, the, other, island, forms, that, have, become, extinct, around, 59, species, of, pigeons, and, doves, are, threatened, with, extinction, today, about, 19, of, all, species, most, of, these, are, tropical, and, live, on, islands, all, of, the, species, are, threatened, by, introduced, predators, habitat, loss, hunting, or, a, combination, of, these, factors, in, some, cases, they, may, be, extinct, in, the, wild, as, is, the, socorro, dove, of, socorro, island, mexico, last, seen, in, the, wild, in, 1972, driven, to, extinction, by, habitat, loss, and, introduced, feral, cats, in, some, areas, a, lack, of, knowledge, means, the, true, status, of, a, species, is, unknown, the, negros, fruit, dove, has, not, been, seen, since, 1953, and, may, or, may, not, be, extinct, and, the, polynesian, ground, dove, is, classified, as, critically, endangered, as, whether, it, survives, or, not, on, remote, islands, in, the, far, west, of, the, pacific, ocean, is, unknown, various, conservation, techniques, are, employed, to, prevent, these, extinctions, including, laws, and, regulations, to, control, hunting, pressure, the, establishment, of, protected, areas, to, prevent, further, habitat, loss, the, establishment, of, captive, populations, for, reintroduction, back, into, the, wild, ex, situ, conservation, and, the, translocation, of, individuals, to, suitable, habitats, to, create, additional, populations, the, pigeon, was, used, in, both, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, notably, by, the, australian, french, german, american, and, uk, forces, they, were, also, awarded, for, their, service, with, various, laurels, throughout, on, 2, december, 1943, three, pigeons, winkie, tyke, and, white, vision, serving, with, britain, s, royal, air, force, were, awarded, the, first, dickin, medal, for, rescuing, an, air, force, crew, during, world, war, ii, thirty, two, pigeons, have, been, decorated, with, the, dickin, medal, citing, their, brave, service, in, war, contributions, including, commando, g, i, joe, paddy, royal, blue, and, william, of, orange, cher, ami, a, homing, pigeon, in, world, war, i, was, awarded, the, croix, de, guerre, medal, by, france, with, a, palm, oak, leaf, cluster, for, his, service, in, verdun, despite, having, almost, lost, a, leg, and, being, shot, in, the, chest, he, managed, to, travel, around, 25, miles, to, deliver, the, message, that, saved, 194, men, of, the, lost, battalion, of, the, 77th, infantry, division, in, the, battle, of, the, argonne, in, october, 1918, when, cher, ami, died, he, was, mounted, and, is, part, of, the, permanent, exhibit, at, the, national, museum, of, american, history, of, the, smithsonian, institution, a, grand, ceremony, was, held, in, buckingham, palace, to, commemorate, a, platoon, of, pigeons, that, braved, the, battlefields, of, normandy, to, deliver, vital, plans, to, allied, forces, on, the, fringes, of, germany, three, of, the, actual, birds, that, received, the, medals, are, on, show, in, the, london, military, museum, so, that, well, wishers, can, pay, their, respects, in, brussels, there, is, a, monument, commemorating, pigeons, that, served, in, world, war, i, the, monument, au, pigeon, soldat, the, rock, dove, has, been, domesticated, for, hundreds, of, years, it, has, been, bred, into, several, varieties, kept, by, hobbyists, of, which, the, best, known, is, the, homing, pigeon, or, racing, homer, other, popular, breeds, are, tumbling, pigeons, such, as, the, birmingham, roller, and, fancy, varieties, that, are, bred, for, certain, physical, characteristics, such, as, large, feathers, on, the, feet, or, fan, shaped, tails, domesticated, rock, pigeons, are, also, bred, as, carrier, pigeons, used, for, thousands, of, years, to, carry, brief, written, messages, and, release, doves, used, in, ceremonies, white, doves, are, also, used, for, entertainment, and, amusement, as, they, are, capable, of, solving, puzzles, and, performing, intricate, tricks, a, variant, called, the, zurito, bred, for, its, speed, may, be, used, in, live, pigeon, shooting, in, ancient, mesopotamia, doves, were, prominent, animal, symbols, of, inanna, ishtar, the, goddess, of, love, sexuality, and, war, doves, are, shown, on, cultic, objects, associated, with, inanna, as, early, as, the, beginning, of, the, third, millennium, bc, lead, dove, figurines, were, discovered, in, the, temple, of, ishtar, at, a, ur, dating, to, the, thirteenth, century, bc, and, a, painted, fresco, from, mari, syria, shows, a, giant, dove, emerging, from, a, palm, tree, in, the, temple, of, ishtar, indicating, that, the, goddess, herself, was, sometimes, believed, to, take, the, form, of, a, dove, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, utnapishtim, releases, a, dove, and, a, raven, to, find, land, the, dove, merely, circles, and, returns, only, then, does, utnapishtim, send, forth, the, raven, which, does, not, return, and, utnapishtim, concludes, the, raven, has, found, land, in, the, ancient, levant, doves, were, used, as, symbols, for, the, canaanite, mother, goddess, asherah, the, ancient, greek, word, for, dove, was, perister, which, may, be, derived, from, the, semitic, phrase, pera, i, tar, meaning, bird, of, ishtar, in, classical, antiquity, doves, were, sacred, to, the, greek, goddess, aphrodite, who, absorbed, this, association, with, doves, from, inanna, ishtar, aphrodite, frequently, appears, with, doves, in, ancient, greek, pottery, the, temple, of, aphrodite, pandemos, on, the, southwest, slope, of, the, athenian, acropolis, was, decorated, with, relief, sculptures, of, doves, with, knotted, fillets, in, their, beaks, and, votive, offerings, of, small, white, marble, doves, were, discovered, in, the, temple, of, aphrodite, at, daphni, during, aphrodite, s, main, festival, the, aphrodisia, her, altars, would, be, purified, with, the, blood, of, a, sacrificed, dove, aphrodite, s, associations, with, doves, influenced, the, roman, goddesses, venus, and, fortuna, causing, them, to, become, associated, with, doves, as, well, in, the, hebrew, bible, doves, or, young, pigeons, are, acceptable, burnt, offerings, for, those, who, cannot, afford, a, more, expensive, animal, in, genesis, noah, sends, a, dove, out, of, the, ark, but, it, came, back, to, him, because, the, floodwaters, had, not, receded, seven, days, later, he, sent, it, again, and, it, came, back, with, an, olive, branch, in, her, mouth, indicating, the, waters, had, receded, enough, for, an, olive, tree, to, grow, dove, is, also, a, term, of, endearment, in, the, song, of, songs, and, elsewhere, in, hebrew, jonah, means, dove, the, sign, of, jonas, in, matthew, 16, is, related, to, the, sign, of, the, dove, jesus, s, parents, sacrificed, doves, on, his, behalf, after, his, circumcision, luke, 2, 24, later, the, holy, spirit, descended, upon, jesus, at, his, baptism, like, a, dove, matthew, and, subsequently, the, peace, dove, became, a, common, christian, symbol, of, the, holy, spirit, in, islam, doves, and, the, pigeon, family, in, general, are, respected, and, favoured, because, they, are, believed, to, have, assisted, the, final, prophet, of, islam, muhammad, in, distracting, his, enemies, outside, the, cave, of, thaw, r, in, the, great, hijra, a, pair, of, pigeons, had, built, a, nest, and, laid, eggs, at, once, and, a, spider, had, woven, cobwebs, which, in, the, darkness, of, the, night, made, the, fugitives, believe, that, muhammad, could, not, be, in, that, cave, several, species, of, pigeons, and, doves, are, used, as, food, however, all, types, are, edible, domesticated, or, hunted, pigeons, have, been, used, as, the, source, of, food, since, the, times, of, the, ancient, middle, east, ancient, rome, and, medieval, europe, it, is, familiar, meat, within, jewish, arab, and, french, cuisines, according, to, the, tanakh, doves, are, kosher, and, they, are, the, only, birds, that, may, be, used, for, a, korban, other, kosher, birds, may, be, eaten, but, not, brought, as, a, korban, pigeon, is, also, used, in, asian, cuisines, such, as, chinese, assamese, and, indonesian, cuisines, in, europe, the, wood, pigeon, is, commonly, shot, as, a, game, bird, while, rock, pigeons, were, originally, domesticated, as, a, food, species, and, many, breeds, were, developed, for, their, meat, bearing, qualities, the, extinction, of, the, passenger, pigeon, in, north, america, was, at, least, partly, due, to, shooting, for, use, as, food, mrs, beeton, s, book, of, household, management, contains, recipes, for, roast, pigeon, and, pigeon, pie, a, popular, inexpensive, food, in, victorian, industrial, britain, there, are, many, public, monuments, around, the, world, devoted, to, and, depicting, pigeons
