the, antbirds, are, a, large, passerine, bird, family, thamnophilidae, found, across, subtropical, and, tropical, central, and, south, america, from, mexico, to, argentina, there, are, more, than, 230, species, known, variously, as, antshrikes, antwrens, antvireos, fire, eyes, bare, eyes, and, bushbirds, they, are, related, to, the, antthrushes, and, antpittas, family, formicariidae, the, tapaculos, the, gnateaters, and, the, ovenbirds, despite, some, species, common, names, this, family, is, not, closely, related, to, the, wrens, vireos, or, shrikes, antbirds, are, generally, small, birds, with, rounded, wings, and, strong, legs, they, have, mostly, sombre, grey, white, brown, and, rufous, plumage, which, is, sexually, dimorphic, in, pattern, and, colouring, some, species, communicate, warnings, to, rivals, by, exposing, white, feather, patches, on, their, backs, or, shoulders, most, have, heavy, bills, which, in, many, species, are, hooked, at, the, tip, most, species, live, in, forests, although, a, few, are, found, in, other, habitats, insects, and, other, arthropods, form, the, most, important, part, of, their, diet, although, small, vertebrates, are, occasionally, taken, most, species, feed, in, the, understory, and, midstory, of, the, forest, although, a, few, feed, in, the, canopy, and, a, few, on, the, ground, many, join, mixed, species, feeding, flocks, and, a, few, species, are, core, members, to, various, degrees, around, eighteen, species, specialise, in, following, swarms, of, army, ants, to, eat, the, small, invertebrates, flushed, by, the, ants, and, many, others, may, feed, in, this, way, opportunistically, antbirds, are, monogamous, mate, for, life, and, defend, territories, they, usually, lay, two, eggs, in, a, nest, that, is, either, suspended, from, branches, or, supported, on, a, branch, stump, or, mound, on, the, ground, both, parents, share, the, tasks, of, incubation, and, of, brooding, and, feeding, the, nestlings, after, fledging, each, parent, cares, exclusively, for, one, chick, thirty, eight, species, are, threatened, with, extinction, as, a, result, of, human, activities, antbirds, are, not, targeted, by, either, hunters, or, the, pet, trade, the, principal, threat, is, habitat, loss, which, causes, habitat, fragmentation, and, increased, nest, predation, in, habitat, fragments, the, antbird, family, thamnophilidae, used, to, be, considered, a, subfamily, thamnophilinae, within, a, larger, family, formicariidae, that, included, antthrushes, and, antpittas, formerly, that, larger, family, was, known, as, the, antbird, family, and, the, thamnophilinae, were, typical, antbirds, in, this, article, antbird, and, antbird, family, refer, to, the, family, thamnophilidae, thamnophilidae, was, removed, from, formicariidae, leaving, behind, the, antthrushes, and, antpittas, due, to, recognition, of, differences, in, the, structure, of, the, breastbone, sternum, and, syrinx, and, sibley, and, ahlquist, s, examination, of, dna, dna, hybridization, the, thamnophilidae, antbirds, are, members, of, the, infraorder, tyrannides, or, tracheophone, suboscines, one, of, two, infraorders, in, the, suborder, tyranni, the, thamnophilidae, are, now, thought, to, occupy, a, fairly, basal, position, within, the, infraorder, i, e, with, regard, to, their, relatives, the, antthrushes, and, antpittas, tapaculos, gnateaters, and, also, the, ovenbirds, the, sister, group, of, the, thamnophilidae, is, thought, to, be, the, gnateaters, the, ovenbirds, tapaculos, antthrushes, and, antpittas, are, thought, to, represent, a, different, radiation, of, that, early, split, the, antbird, family, contains, over, 230, species, variously, called, antwrens, antvireos, antbirds, and, antshrikes, the, names, refer, to, the, relative, sizes, of, the, birds, increasing, in, the, order, given, though, with, exceptions, rather, than, any, particular, resemblance, to, the, true, wrens, vireos, or, shrikes, in, addition, members, of, the, genus, phlegopsis, are, known, as, bare, eyes, pyriglena, as, fire, eyes, and, neoctantes, and, clytoctantes, as, bushbirds, although, the, systematics, of, the, thamnophilidae, is, based, on, studies, from, the, mid, 19th, century, when, fewer, than, half, the, present, species, were, known, comparison, of, the, myoglobin, intron, 2, gapdh, intron, 11, and, the, mtdna, cytochrome, b, dna, sequences, has, largely, confirmed, it, there, are, two, major, clades, most, antshrikes, and, other, larger, strong, billed, species, as, well, as, herpsilochmus, versus, the, classical, antwrens, and, other, more, slender, longer, billed, species, and, the, monophyly, of, most, genera, was, confirmed, the, thamnophilidae, contains, several, large, or, very, large, genera, and, numerous, small, or, monotypic, ones, several, which, are, difficult, to, assign, seem, to, form, a, third, hitherto, unrecognised, clade, independently, derived, from, ancestral, antbirds, the, results, also, confirmed, suspicions, of, previous, researchers, that, some, species, most, notably, in, myrmotherula, and, myrmeciza, need, to, be, assigned, to, other, genera, still, due, to, the, difficulties, of, sampling, from, such, a, large, number, of, often, poorly, known, species, the, assignment, of, some, genera, is, still, awaiting, confirmation, the, antbirds, are, a, group, of, small, to, medium, sized, passerines, that, range, in, size, from, the, large, giant, antshrike, which, measures, 45, cm, 18, in, and, weighs, 150, g, 5, 29, oz, to, the, tiny, 8, cm, 3, in, pygmy, antwren, which, weighs, 7, g, 0, 25, oz, in, general, terms, antshrikes, are, relatively, large, bodied, birds, antvireos, are, medium, sized, and, chunky, while, antwrens, include, most, smaller, species, antbird, genera, can, vary, greatly, in, size, members, of, this, family, have, short, rounded, wings, that, provide, good, manoeuvrability, when, flying, in, dense, undergrowth, the, legs, are, large, and, strong, particularly, in, species, that, are, obligate, ant, followers, these, species, are, well, adapted, to, gripping, vertical, stems, and, saplings, which, are, more, common, than, horizontal, branches, in, the, undergrowth, and, thus, the, ability, to, grip, them, is, an, advantage, for, birds, following, swarms, of, army, ants, the, claws, of, these, antbirds, are, longer, than, those, of, species, that, do, not, follow, ants, and, the, soles, of, some, species, have, projections, that, are, tough, and, gripping, when, the, foot, is, clenched, tarsus, length, in, antbirds, is, related, to, foraging, strategy, longer, tarsi, typically, occur, in, genera, such, as, the, thamnophilus, antshrikes, that, forage, by, perch, gleaning, sitting, and, leaning, forward, to, snatch, insects, from, the, branch, whereas, shorter, tarsi, typically, occur, in, those, that, catch, prey, on, the, wing, such, as, the, thamnomanes, antshrikes, most, antbirds, have, proportionately, large, heavy, bills, several, genera, of, antshrike, have, a, strongly, hooked, tip, to, the, bill, and, all, antbirds, have, a, notch, or, tooth, at, the, tip, of, the, bill, which, helps, in, holding, and, crushing, insect, prey, the, two, genera, of, bushbirds, have, upturned, chisel, like, bills, the, plumage, of, antbirds, is, soft, and, not, brightly, coloured, although, it, is, occasionally, striking, the, colour, palette, of, most, species, is, blackish, shades, whitish, shades, rufous, chestnut, and, brown, plumages, can, be, uniform, in, colour, or, patterned, with, barring, or, spots, sexual, dimorphism, differences, in, plumage, colour, and, pattern, between, males, and, females, is, common, in, the, family, overall, the, pattern, within, the, family, is, for, the, males, to, have, combinations, of, grey, black, or, white, plumage, and, the, females, having, buff, rufous, and, brown, colours, for, example, the, male, dot, winged, antwren, is, primarily, blackish, whereas, the, female, has, rust, coloured, underparts, in, some, genera, such, as, myrmotherula, species, are, better, distinguished, by, female, plumage, than, by, male, many, species, of, antbirds, have, a, contrasting, patch, of, white, sometimes, other, colours, feathers, on, the, back, known, as, interscapular, patches, shoulder, or, underwing, this, is, usually, concealed, by, the, darker, feathers, on, the, back, but, when, the, bird, is, excited, or, alarmed, these, feathers, can, be, raised, to, flash, the, white, patch, dot, winged, antwrens, puff, out, white, back, patches, whereas, in, bluish, slate, antshrikes, and, white, flanked, antwrens, the, white, patch, is, on, the, shoulder, the, songs, and, calls, of, antbirds, are, generally, composed, of, repeated, simple, uncomplicated, notes, the, family, is, one, of, the, suboscines, suborder, tyranni, which, have, simpler, syrinxes, voiceboxes, than, other, songbirds, nevertheless, their, songs, are, distinctive, and, species, specific, allowing, field, identification, by, ear, antbirds, rely, on, their, calls, for, communication, as, is, typical, of, birds, in, dark, forests, most, species, have, at, least, two, types, of, call, the, loudsong, and, the, softsong, the, functions, of, many, calls, have, been, deduced, from, their, context, for, example, some, loudsongs, have, a, territorial, purpose, and, are, given, when, birds, meet, at, the, edges, of, their, territories, or, during, the, morning, rounds, of, the, territory, pairs, in, neighbouring, territories, judge, the, proximity, of, rivals, by, the, degradation, of, the, song, caused, by, interference, by, the, environment, in, bouts, of, territorial, defence, the, male, will, face, off, with, the, other, male, and, the, female, with, her, counterpart, loudsong, duets, are, also, potentially, related, to, the, maintenance, of, pair, bonds, the, functions, of, softsongs, are, more, complex, and, possibly, related, to, pair, bond, maintenance, in, addition, to, these, two, main, calls, a, range, of, other, sounds, are, made, these, include, scolding, in, mobbing, of, predators, the, calls, of, antbirds, are, also, used, interspecifically, some, species, of, antbirds, and, even, other, birds, will, actively, seek, out, ant, swarms, using, the, calls, of, some, species, of, ant, followers, as, clues, the, distribution, of, the, antbirds, is, entirely, neotropical, with, the, vast, majority, of, the, species, being, found, in, the, tropics, a, few, species, reach, southern, mexico, and, northern, argentina, some, species, such, as, the, barred, antshrike, have, a, continental, distribution, that, spans, most, of, the, south, and, middle, american, distribution, of, the, family, others, such, as, the, ash, throated, antwren, have, a, tiny, distribution, antbirds, are, mostly, birds, of, humid, lowland, rainforests, few, species, are, found, at, higher, elevations, with, less, than, 10, of, species, having, ranges, above, 2000, m, 6500, ft, and, almost, none, with, ranges, above, 3000, m, 10000, ft, the, highest, species, diversity, is, found, in, the, amazon, basin, with, up, to, 45, species, being, found, in, single, locations, in, sites, across, brazil, colombia, bolivia, and, peru, the, number, of, species, drops, dramatically, towards, the, further, reaches, of, the, family, s, range, there, are, only, seven, species, in, mexico, for, example, areas, of, lower, thamnophilid, diversity, may, contain, localised, endemics, however, the, yapacana, antbird, for, example, is, restricted, to, the, stunted, woodlands, that, grow, in, areas, of, nutrient, poor, white, sand, soil, the, so, called, amazonian, caatinga, in, brazil, venezuela, and, colombia, some, species, are, predominantly, associated, with, microhabitats, within, a, greater, ecosystem, for, example, the, bamboo, antshrike, is, predominantly, found, in, bamboo, patches, genetic, comparison, of, the, whole, genomes, of, higher, and, lower, humidity, antbirds, have, shown, some, differences, in, genes, linked, to, water, balance, and, temperature, regulation, more, significantly, antbirds, differ, in, the, regions, of, the, genome, that, regulate, gene, activity, suggesting, that, differences, for, antbirds, are, a, result, less, of, the, genes, themselves, than, of, how, they, are, deployed, antbirds, are, diurnal, they, feed, breed, and, defend, territories, during, the, day, many, of, the, family, are, however, reluctant, to, enter, areas, of, direct, sunlight, where, it, breaks, through, the, forest, canopy, antbirds, will, engage, in, anting, a, behaviour, in, which, ants, or, other, arthropods, are, rubbed, on, the, feathers, before, being, discarded, or, eaten, while, this, has, conventionally, been, considered, a, way, to, remove, and, control, feather, parasites, it, has, been, suggested, that, for, antbirds, it, may, simply, be, a, way, to, deal, with, the, distasteful, substances, in, prey, items, the, main, component, of, the, diet, of, all, antbirds, is, arthropods, these, are, mostly, insects, including, grasshoppers, and, crickets, cockroaches, praying, mantises, stick, insects, and, the, larvae, of, butterflies, and, moths, in, addition, antbirds, often, take, spiders, scorpions, and, centipedes, they, swallow, smaller, prey, items, quickly, whereas, they, often, beat, larger, items, against, branches, in, order, to, remove, wings, and, spines, larger, species, can, kill, and, consume, frogs, and, lizards, as, well, but, generally, these, do, not, form, an, important, part, of, the, diet, of, this, family, other, food, items, may, also, be, eaten, including, fruit, eggs, and, slugs, the, family, uses, a, number, of, techniques, to, obtain, prey, the, majority, of, antbirds, are, arboreal, with, most, of, those, feeding, in, the, understory, many, in, the, middle, story, and, some, in, the, canopy, a, few, species, feed, in, the, leaf, litter, for, example, the, wing, banded, antbird, forages, in, areas, of, dense, leaf, litter, it, does, not, use, its, feet, to, scratch, the, leaf, litter, as, do, some, other, birds, instead, it, uses, its, long, bill, to, turn, over, leaves, rapidly, never, picking, them, up, the, antbirds, that, forage, arboreally, show, a, number, of, techniques, and, specialisations, some, species, perch, glean, perching, on, a, branch, watching, for, prey, and, snatching, it, by, reaching, forward, where, others, sally, from, a, perch, and, snatch, prey, on, the, wing, in, both, cases, birds, will, hop, through, the, foliage, or, undergrowth, and, pause, scanning, for, prey, before, pouncing, or, moving, on, the, time, paused, varies, although, smaller, species, tend, to, be, more, active, and, pause, for, shorter, times, many, species, participate, in, mixed, species, feeding, flocks, forming, a, large, percentage, of, the, participating, species, within, their, range, some, of, these, are, core, or, nuclear, species, these, nuclear, species, share, territories, with, other, nuclear, species, but, exclude, conspecifics, members, of, the, same, species, and, are, found, in, almost, all, flocks, these, are, joined, by, attendant, species, loud, and, distinctive, calls, and, conspicuous, plumage, are, important, attributes, of, nuclear, species, as, they, promote, cohesion, in, the, flock, the, composition, of, these, flocks, varies, geographically, in, amazonia, species, of, thamnomanes, antshrike, are, the, leading, nuclear, species, elsewhere, other, species, such, as, the, dot, winged, antwrens, and, checker, throated, stipplethroats, fill, this, role, other, species, of, antwren, and, antbird, join, them, along, with, woodcreepers, ant, tanagers, foliage, gleaners, and, greenlets, the, benefits, of, the, mixed, flock, are, thought, to, be, related, to, predation, since, many, eyes, are, better, for, spotting, predatory, hawks, and, falcons, comparisons, between, multi, species, feeding, flocks, in, different, parts, of, the, world, found, that, instances, of, flocking, were, positively, correlated, with, predation, risk, by, raptors, for, example, where, thamnomanes, antshrikes, lead, the, group, they, give, loud, warning, calls, in, the, presence, of, predators, these, calls, are, understood, and, reacted, to, by, all, the, other, species, in, the, flock, the, advantage, to, the, thamnomanes, antshrikes, is, in, allowing, the, rest, of, the, flock, which, are, typically, gleaners, to, act, as, beaters, flushing, prey, while, foraging, which, the, antshrikes, can, obtain, by, sallying, similar, roles, are, filled, in, other, flocks, by, other, antbird, species, or, other, bird, families, for, example, the, shrike, tanagers, within, the, feeding, flocks, competition, is, reduced, by, microniche, partitioning, where, dot, winged, antwrens, checker, throated, stipplethroats, and, white, flanked, antwrens, feed, in, flocks, together, the, dot, wings, feed, in, the, densest, vines, the, white, flank, in, less, dense, vegetation, and, the, checker, throats, in, the, same, density, as, the, latter, but, in, dead, foliage, only, swarms, of, army, ants, are, an, important, resource, used, by, some, species, of, antbird, and, the, one, from, which, the, family, s, common, name, is, derived, many, species, of, tropical, ant, form, large, raiding, swarms, but, the, swarms, are, often, nocturnal, or, raid, underground, while, birds, visit, these, swarms, when, they, occur, the, species, most, commonly, attended, by, birds, is, the, neotropical, species, eciton, burchellii, which, is, both, diurnal, and, surface, raiding, it, was, once, thought, that, attending, birds, were, actually, eating, the, ants, but, numerous, studies, in, various, parts, of, eciton, burchellii, s, range, has, shown, that, the, ants, act, as, beaters, flushing, insects, other, arthropods, and, small, vertebrates, into, the, waiting, flocks, of, ant, followers, the, improvement, in, foraging, efficiency, can, be, dramatic, a, study, of, spotted, antbirds, found, that, they, made, attempts, at, prey, every, 111, 8, seconds, away, from, ants, but, at, swarms, they, made, attempts, every, 32, 3, seconds, while, many, species, of, antbirds, and, other, families, may, opportunistically, feed, at, army, ant, swarms, 18, species, of, antbird, are, obligate, ant, followers, obtaining, most, of, their, diet, from, swarms, with, only, three, exceptions, these, species, never, regularly, forage, away, from, ant, swarms, a, further, four, species, regularly, attend, swarms, but, are, as, often, seen, away, from, them, obligate, ant, followers, visit, the, nesting, bivouacs, of, army, ants, in, the, morning, to, check, for, raiding, activities, other, species, do, not, these, species, tend, to, arrive, at, swarms, first, and, their, calls, are, used, by, other, species, to, locate, swarming, ants, because, army, ants, are, unpredictable, in, their, movements, it, is, impractical, for, obligate, ant, followers, to, maintain, a, territory, that, always, contains, swarms, to, feed, around, antbirds, have, evolved, a, more, complicated, system, than, the, strict, territoriality, of, most, other, birds, they, generally, details, vary, among, species, maintain, breeding, territories, but, travel, outside, those, territories, in, order, to, feed, at, swarms, several, pairs, of, the, same, species, may, attend, a, swarm, with, the, dominant, pair, at, the, swarm, being, the, pair, which, holds, the, territory, that, the, swarm, is, in, in, addition, to, competition, within, species, competition, among, species, exists, and, larger, species, are, dominant, in, its, range, the, ocellated, antbird, is, the, largest, of, the, obligate, ant, following, antbirds, and, is, dominant, over, other, members, of, the, family, although, it, is, subordinate, to, various, species, from, other, families, including, certain, woodcreepers, motmots, and, the, rufous, vented, ground, cuckoo, at, a, swarm, the, dominant, species, occupies, positions, above, the, central, front, of, the, swarm, which, yields, the, largest, amount, of, prey, smaller, less, dominant, species, locate, themselves, further, away, from, the, centre, or, higher, above, the, location, of, the, dominant, species, where, prey, is, less, plentiful, antbirds, are, monogamous, in, almost, all, cases, forming, pair, bonds, that, last, the, life, of, the, pair, studies, of, the, dusky, antbird, and, the, white, bellied, antbird, did, not, find, infidelity, in, the, white, plumed, antbird, divorces, between, pairs, are, common, but, as, far, as, known, this, species, is, exceptional, in, most, species, the, pair, defends, a, classic, territory, although, the, nesting, territories, of, ant, followers, are, slightly, different, see, feeding, above, territories, vary, in, size, from, as, small, as, 0, 5, ha, for, the, manu, antbird, to, 1500, m, 5000, ft, in, diameter, for, the, ocellated, antbird, ocellated, antbirds, have, an, unusual, social, system, where, the, breeding, pair, forms, the, nucleus, of, a, group, or, clan, that, includes, their, male, offspring, and, their, mates, these, clans, which, can, number, up, to, eight, birds, work, together, to, defend, territories, against, rivals, pair, bonds, are, formed, with, courtship, feeding, where, the, male, presents, food, items, to, the, female, in, spotted, antbirds, males, may, actually, feed, females, sufficiently, for, the, female, to, cease, feeding, herself, although, she, will, resume, feeding, once, copulation, has, occurred, mutual, grooming, also, plays, a, role, in, courtship, in, some, species, the, nesting, and, breeding, biology, of, antbirds, have, not, been, well, studied, even, in, relatively, well, known, species, the, breeding, behaviour, can, be, poorly, known, for, example, the, nest, of, the, ocellated, antbird, was, first, described, in, 2004, nests, are, constructed, by, both, parents, although, the, male, undertakes, more, of, the, work, in, some, species, antbird, nests, are, cups, of, vegetation, such, as, twigs, dead, leaves, and, plant, fibre, and, they, follow, two, basic, patterns, either, suspended, or, supported, suspended, cups, which, may, hang, from, forks, in, branches, or, between, two, branches, are, the, more, common, style, of, nest, supported, nests, rest, upon, branches, amongst, vines, in, hollows, and, sometimes, on, mounds, of, vegetation, on, the, ground, each, species, nests, at, the, level, where, it, forages, so, a, midstory, species, would, build, its, nest, in, the, midstory, closely, related, species, nest, in, the, same, ways, for, example, antvireos, in, the, genus, dysithamnus, are, all, suspension, nesters, almost, all, antbirds, lay, two, eggs, a, few, species, of, antshrike, lay, three, eggs, and, a, smaller, number, of, antbirds, lay, one, egg, but, this, is, unusual, small, clutch, sizes, are, typical, of, tropical, birds, compared, to, more, temperate, species, of, the, same, size, possibly, due, to, nest, predation, although, this, is, disputed, both, parents, participate, in, incubation, although, only, the, female, incubates, at, night, the, length, of, time, taken, for, chicks, to, hatch, is, 14, 16, days, in, most, species, although, some, such, as, the, dusky, antbird, can, take, as, long, as, 20, days, the, altricial, chicks, are, born, naked, and, blind, both, parents, brood, the, young, until, they, are, able, to, thermoregulate, although, as, with, incubation, only, the, female, broods, at, night, in, common, with, many, songbirds, the, parents, take, faecal, sacs, for, disposal, away, from, the, nest, both, parents, feed, the, chicks, often, bringing, large, prey, items, when, the, chicks, reach, fledging, age, after, 8, 15, days, attending, parents, call, their, chicks, as, each, chick, leaves, the, nest, it, is, cared, for, exclusively, from, then, on, by, the, parent, that, was, present, then, after, the, first, chick, fledges, and, leaves, with, a, parent, the, remaining, parent, may, increase, the, supply, of, food, to, speed, up, the, process, of, fledging, after, fledging, chicks, spend, the, first, few, days, well, hidden, as, the, parents, bring, them, food, chicks, of, some, species, may, not, become, independent, of, the, parents, for, as, long, as, four, months, in, some, antwrens, but, two, months, is, more, typical, for, the, rest, of, the, family, antbirds, are, common, components, of, the, avifauna, of, some, parts, of, the, neotropics, and, are, thought, to, be, important, in, some, ecological, processes, they, are, preyed, upon, by, birds, of, prey, and, their, tendency, to, join, flocks, is, thought, to, provide, protection, against, such, predation, the, greater, round, eared, bat, preys, on, some, antbird, species, such, as, the, white, bibbed, antbird, and, the, scaled, antbird, the, latter, is, the, bat, s, preferred, prey, nests, including, incubating, adults, chicks, and, eggs, are, vulnerable, to, predators, particularly, snakes, but, also, nocturnal, mammals, nesting, success, is, low, for, many, species, particularly, in, areas, of, fragmented, habitat, it, was, once, suggested, that, the, relationship, between, the, obligate, and, regular, ant, followers, and, the, army, ants, particularly, eciton, burchellii, was, mutualistic, with, the, ants, benefiting, by, having, the, birds, chase, prey, back, down, towards, them, however, experiments, where, ant, followers, were, excluded, have, shown, that, the, foraging, success, of, the, army, ants, was, 30, lower, when, the, birds, were, present, suggesting, that, the, birds, relationship, was, in, fact, parasitic, this, has, resulted, in, a, number, of, behaviours, by, the, ants, in, order, to, reduce, kleptoparasitism, including, hiding, of, secured, prey, in, the, leaf, litter, and, caching, of, food, on, trails, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, depressive, effect, of, this, parasitism, slows, the, development, of, e, burchellii, swarms, and, in, turn, benefits, other, ant, species, which, are, preyed, upon, by, army, ants, the, ant, following, antbirds, are, themselves, followed, by, three, species, of, butterfly, in, the, family, ithomiinae, which, feed, on, their, droppings, bird, droppings, are, usually, an, unpredictable, resource, in, a, rainforest, but, the, regular, behaviour, of, ant, followers, makes, the, exploitation, of, this, resource, possible, as, of, april, 2008, 38, species, are, considered, by, the, iucn, to, be, near, threatened, or, worse, and, therefore, at, risk, of, extinction, antbirds, are, neither, targeted, by, the, pet, trade, nor, large, enough, to, be, hunted, the, principal, cause, of, the, decline, in, antbird, species, is, habitat, loss, the, destruction, or, modification, of, forests, has, several, effects, on, different, species, of, antbirds, the, fragmentation, of, forests, into, smaller, patches, affects, species, that, are, averse, to, crossing, gaps, as, small, as, roads, if, these, species, become, locally, extinct, in, a, fragment, this, reluctance, to, cross, unforested, barriers, makes, their, re, establishment, unlikely, smaller, forest, fragments, are, unable, to, sustain, mixed, species, feeding, flocks, leading, to, local, extinctions, another, risk, faced, by, antbirds, in, fragmented, habitat, is, increased, nest, predation, an, unplanned, experiment, in, fragmentation, occurred, on, barro, colorado, island, a, former, hill, in, panama, that, became, an, isolated, island, during, the, flooding, caused, by, the, creation, of, the, panama, canal, numerous, species, of, antbird, formerly, resident, in, the, area, were, extirpated, in, no, small, part, due, to, increased, levels, of, nest, predation, on, the, island, while, the, species, lost, from, barro, colorado, are, not, globally, threatened, they, illustrate, the, vulnerability, of, species, in, fragmented, habitats, and, help, explain, the, declines, of, some, species, the, majority, of, threatened, species, have, very, small, natural, ranges, some, are, also, extremely, poorly, known, for, example, the, rio, de, janeiro, antwren, is, known, only, from, a, single, specimen, collected, in, 1982, although, there, have, been, unconfirmed, reports, since, 1994, and, it, is, currently, listed, as, critically, endangered, additionally, new, species, are, discovered, at, regular, intervals, the, caatinga, antwren, was, described, in, 2000, the, acre, antshrike, in, 2004, the, sincor, antwren, in, 2007, and, the, description, of, a, relative, of, the, paran, antwren, discovered, in, 2005, in, the, outskirts, of, s, o, paulo, is, being, prepared, while, not, yet, scientifically, described, conservation, efforts, have, already, been, necessary, as, the, site, of, discovery, was, set, out, to, be, flooded, to, form, a, reservoir, consequently, 72, individuals, were, captured, and, transferred, to, another, locality
