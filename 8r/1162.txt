basidiomycota, b, s, d, i, o, m, a, k, o, t, is, one, of, two, large, divisions, that, together, with, the, ascomycota, constitute, the, subkingdom, dikarya, often, referred, to, as, the, higher, fungi, within, the, kingdom, fungi, members, are, known, as, basidiomycetes, more, specifically, basidiomycota, includes, these, groups, agarics, puffballs, stinkhorns, bracket, fungi, other, polypores, jelly, fungi, boletes, chanterelles, earth, stars, smuts, bunts, rusts, mirror, yeasts, and, cryptococcus, the, human, pathogenic, yeast, basidiomycota, are, filamentous, fungi, composed, of, hyphae, except, for, basidiomycota, yeast, and, reproduce, sexually, via, the, formation, of, specialized, club, shaped, end, cells, called, basidia, that, normally, bear, external, meiospores, usually, four, these, specialized, spores, are, called, basidiospores, however, some, basidiomycota, are, obligate, asexual, reproducers, basidiomycota, that, reproduce, asexually, discussed, below, can, typically, be, recognized, as, members, of, this, division, by, gross, similarity, to, others, by, the, formation, of, a, distinctive, anatomical, feature, the, clamp, connection, cell, wall, components, and, definitively, by, phylogenetic, molecular, analysis, of, dna, sequence, data, a, 2007, classification, adopted, by, a, coalition, of, 67, mycologists, recognized, three, subphyla, pucciniomycotina, ustilaginomycotina, agaricomycotina, and, two, other, class, level, taxa, wallemiomycetes, entorrhizomycetes, outside, of, these, among, the, basidiomycota, as, now, classified, the, subphyla, join, and, also, cut, across, various, obsolete, taxonomic, groups, see, below, previously, commonly, used, to, describe, basidiomycota, according, to, a, 2008, estimate, basidiomycota, comprise, three, subphyla, including, six, unassigned, classes, 16, classes, 52, orders, 177, families, 1, 589, genera, and, 31, 515, species, wijayawardene, et, al, 2020, produced, an, update, that, recognized, 19, classes, agaricomycetes, agaricostilbomycetes, atractiellomycetes, bartheletiomycetes, classiculomycetes, cryptomycocolacomycetes, cystobasidiomycetes, dacrymycetes, exobasidiomycetes, malasseziomycetes, microbotryomycetes, mixiomycetes, monilielliomycetes, pucciniomycetes, spiculogloeomycetes, tremellomycetes, tritirachiomycetes, ustilaginomycetes, and, wallemiomycetes, with, multiple, orders, and, genera, traditionally, the, basidiomycota, were, divided, into, two, classes, now, obsolete, nonetheless, these, former, concepts, continue, to, be, used, as, two, types, of, growth, habit, groupings, the, mushrooms, e, g, schizophyllum, commune, and, the, non, mushrooms, e, g, mycosarcoma, maydis, the, agaricomycotina, include, what, had, previously, been, called, the, hymenomycetes, an, obsolete, morphological, based, class, of, basidiomycota, that, formed, hymenial, layers, on, their, fruitbodies, the, gasteromycetes, another, obsolete, class, that, included, species, mostly, lacking, hymenia, and, mostly, forming, spores, in, enclosed, fruitbodies, as, well, as, most, of, the, jelly, fungi, this, sub, phyla, also, includes, the, classic, mushrooms, polypores, corals, chanterelles, crusts, puffballs, and, stinkhorns, the, three, classes, in, the, agaricomycotina, are, the, agaricomycetes, the, dacrymycetes, and, the, tremellomycetes, the, class, wallemiomycetes, is, not, yet, placed, in, a, subdivision, but, recent, genomic, evidence, suggests, that, it, is, a, sister, group, of, agaricomycotina, the, pucciniomycotina, include, the, rust, fungi, the, insect, parasitic, symbiotic, genus, septobasidium, a, former, group, of, smut, fungi, in, the, microbotryomycetes, which, includes, mirror, yeasts, and, a, mixture, of, odd, infrequently, seen, or, seldom, recognized, fungi, often, parasitic, on, plants, the, eight, classes, in, the, pucciniomycotina, are, agaricostilbomycetes, atractiellomycetes, classiculomycetes, cryptomycocolacomycetes, cystobasidiomycetes, microbotryomycetes, mixiomycetes, and, pucciniomycetes, the, ustilaginomycotina, are, most, but, not, all, of, the, former, smut, fungi, and, the, exobasidiales, the, classes, of, the, ustilaginomycotina, are, the, exobasidiomycetes, the, entorrhizomycetes, and, the, ustilaginomycetes, there, are, several, genera, classified, in, the, basidiomycota, that, are, 1, poorly, known, 2, have, not, been, subjected, to, dna, analysis, or, 3, if, analysed, phylogenetically, do, not, group, with, as, yet, named, or, identified, families, and, have, not, been, assigned, to, a, specific, family, i, e, they, are, incertae, sedis, with, respect, to, familial, placement, these, include, unlike, animals, and, plants, which, have, readily, recognizable, male, and, female, counterparts, basidiomycota, except, for, the, rust, pucciniales, tend, to, have, mutually, indistinguishable, compatible, haploids, which, are, usually, mycelia, being, composed, of, filamentous, hyphae, typically, haploid, basidiomycota, mycelia, fuse, via, plasmogamy, and, then, the, compatible, nuclei, migrate, into, each, other, s, mycelia, and, pair, up, with, the, resident, nuclei, karyogamy, is, delayed, so, that, the, compatible, nuclei, remain, in, pairs, called, a, dikaryon, the, hyphae, are, then, said, to, be, dikaryotic, conversely, the, haploid, mycelia, are, called, monokaryons, often, the, dikaryotic, mycelium, is, more, vigorous, than, the, individual, monokaryotic, mycelia, and, proceeds, to, take, over, the, substrate, in, which, they, are, growing, the, dikaryons, can, be, long, lived, lasting, years, decades, or, centuries, the, monokaryons, are, neither, male, nor, female, they, have, either, a, bipolar, unifactorial, or, a, tetrapolar, bifactorial, mating, system, this, results, in, the, fact, that, following, meiosis, the, resulting, haploid, basidiospores, and, resultant, monokaryons, have, nuclei, that, are, compatible, with, 50, if, bipolar, or, 25, if, tetrapolar, of, their, sister, basidiospores, and, their, resultant, monokaryons, because, the, mating, genes, must, differ, for, them, to, be, compatible, however, there, are, sometimes, more, than, two, possible, alleles, for, a, given, locus, and, in, such, species, depending, on, the, specifics, over, 90, of, monokaryons, could, be, compatible, with, each, other, the, maintenance, of, the, dikaryotic, status, in, dikaryons, in, many, basidiomycota, is, facilitated, by, the, formation, of, clamp, connections, that, physically, appear, to, help, coordinate, and, re, establish, pairs, of, compatible, nuclei, following, synchronous, mitotic, nuclear, divisions, variations, are, frequent, and, multiple, in, a, typical, basidiomycota, lifecycle, the, long, lasting, dikaryons, periodically, seasonally, or, occasionally, produce, basidia, the, specialized, usually, club, shaped, end, cells, in, which, a, pair, of, compatible, nuclei, fuse, karyogamy, to, form, a, diploid, cell, meiosis, follows, shortly, with, the, production, of, 4, haploid, nuclei, that, migrate, into, 4, external, usually, apical, basidiospores, variations, occur, however, typically, the, basidiospores, are, ballistic, hence, they, are, sometimes, also, called, ballistospores, in, most, species, the, basidiospores, disperse, and, each, can, start, a, new, haploid, mycelium, continuing, the, lifecycle, basidia, are, microscopic, but, they, are, often, produced, on, or, in, multicelled, large, fructifications, called, basidiocarps, or, basidiomes, or, fruitbodies, variously, called, mushrooms, puffballs, etc, ballistic, basidiospores, are, formed, on, sterigmata, which, are, tapered, spine, like, projections, on, basidia, and, are, typically, curved, like, the, horns, of, a, bull, in, some, basidiomycota, the, spores, are, not, ballistic, and, the, sterigmata, may, be, straight, reduced, to, stubs, or, absent, the, basidiospores, of, these, non, ballistosporic, basidia, may, either, bud, off, or, be, released, via, dissolution, or, disintegration, of, the, basidia, in, summary, meiosis, takes, place, in, a, diploid, basidium, each, one, of, the, four, haploid, nuclei, migrates, into, its, own, basidiospore, the, basidiospores, are, ballistically, discharged, and, start, new, haploid, mycelia, called, monokaryons, there, are, no, males, or, females, rather, there, are, compatible, thalli, with, multiple, compatibility, factors, plasmogamy, between, compatible, individuals, leads, to, delayed, karyogamy, leading, to, establishment, of, a, dikaryon, the, dikaryon, is, long, lasting, but, ultimately, gives, rise, to, either, fruitbodies, with, basidia, or, directly, to, basidia, without, fruitbodies, the, paired, dikaryon, in, the, basidium, fuse, i, e, karyogamy, takes, place, the, diploid, basidium, begins, the, cycle, again, coprinopsis, cinerea, is, a, basidiomycete, mushroom, it, is, particularly, suited, to, the, study, of, meiosis, because, meiosis, progresses, synchronously, in, about, 10, million, cells, within, the, mushroom, cap, and, the, meiotic, prophase, stage, is, prolonged, burns, et, al, studied, the, expression, of, genes, involved, in, the, 15, hour, meiotic, process, and, found, that, the, pattern, of, gene, expression, of, c, cinerea, was, similar, to, two, other, fungal, species, the, yeasts, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, and, schizosaccharomyces, pombe, these, similarities, in, the, patterns, of, expression, led, to, the, conclusion, that, the, core, expression, program, of, meiosis, has, been, conserved, in, these, fungi, for, over, half, a, billion, years, of, evolution, since, these, species, diverged, cryptococcus, neoformans, and, mycosarcoma, maydis, are, examples, of, pathogenic, basidiomycota, such, pathogens, must, be, able, to, overcome, the, oxidative, defenses, of, their, respective, hosts, in, order, to, produce, a, successful, infection, the, ability, to, undergo, meiosis, may, provide, a, survival, benefit, for, these, fungi, by, promoting, successful, infection, a, characteristic, central, feature, of, meiosis, is, recombination, between, homologous, chromosomes, this, process, is, associated, with, repair, of, dna, damage, particularly, double, strand, breaks, the, ability, of, c, neoformans, and, m, maydis, to, undergo, meiosis, may, contribute, to, their, virulence, by, repairing, the, oxidative, dna, damage, caused, by, their, host, s, release, of, reactive, oxygen, species, many, variations, occur, some, variations, are, self, compatible, and, spontaneously, form, dikaryons, without, a, separate, compatible, thallus, being, involved, these, fungi, are, said, to, be, homothallic, versus, the, normal, heterothallic, species, with, mating, types, others, are, secondarily, homothallic, in, that, two, compatible, nuclei, following, meiosis, migrate, into, each, basidiospore, which, is, then, dispersed, as, a, pre, existing, dikaryon, often, such, species, form, only, two, spores, per, basidium, but, that, too, varies, following, meiosis, mitotic, divisions, can, occur, in, the, basidium, multiple, numbers, of, basidiospores, can, result, including, odd, numbers, via, degeneration, of, nuclei, or, pairing, up, of, nuclei, or, lack, of, migration, of, nuclei, for, example, the, chanterelle, genus, craterellus, often, has, six, spored, basidia, while, some, corticioid, sistotrema, species, can, have, two, four, six, or, eight, spored, basidia, and, the, cultivated, button, mushroom, agaricus, bisporus, can, have, one, two, three, or, four, spored, basidia, under, some, circumstances, occasionally, monokaryons, of, some, taxa, can, form, morphologically, fully, formed, basidiomes, and, anatomically, correct, basidia, and, ballistic, basidiospores, in, the, absence, of, dikaryon, formation, diploid, nuclei, and, meiosis, a, rare, few, number, of, taxa, have, extended, diploid, lifecycles, but, can, be, common, species, examples, exist, in, the, mushroom, genera, armillaria, and, xerula, both, in, the, physalacriaceae, occasionally, basidiospores, are, not, formed, and, parts, of, the, basidia, act, as, the, dispersal, agents, e, g, the, peculiar, mycoparasitic, jelly, fungus, tetragoniomyces, or, the, entire, basidium, acts, as, a, spore, e, g, in, some, false, puffballs, scleroderma, in, the, human, pathogenic, genus, cryptococcus, four, nuclei, following, meiosis, remain, in, the, basidium, but, continually, divide, mitotically, each, nucleus, migrating, into, synchronously, forming, nonballistic, basidiospores, that, are, then, pushed, upwards, by, another, set, forming, below, them, resulting, in, four, parallel, chains, of, dry, basidiospores, other, variations, occur, some, as, standard, lifecycles, that, themselves, have, variations, within, variations, within, specific, orders, rusts, pucciniales, previously, known, as, uredinales, at, their, greatest, complexity, produce, five, different, types, of, spores, on, two, different, host, plants, in, two, unrelated, host, families, such, rusts, are, heteroecious, requiring, two, hosts, and, macrocyclic, producing, all, five, spores, types, wheat, stem, rust, is, an, example, by, convention, the, stages, and, spore, states, are, numbered, by, roman, numerals, typically, basidiospores, infect, host, one, also, known, as, the, alternate, or, sexual, host, and, the, mycelium, forms, pycnidia, which, are, miniature, flask, shaped, hollow, submicroscopic, bodies, embedded, in, the, host, tissue, such, as, a, leaf, this, stage, numbered, 0, produces, single, celled, spores, that, ooze, out, in, a, sweet, liquid, and, that, act, as, nonmotile, spermatia, and, also, protruding, receptive, hyphae, insects, and, probably, other, vectors, such, as, rain, carry, the, spermatia, from, spermagonium, to, spermagonium, cross, inoculating, the, mating, types, neither, thallus, is, male, or, female, once, crossed, the, dikaryons, are, established, and, a, second, spore, stage, is, formed, numbered, i, and, called, aecia, which, form, dikaryotic, aeciospores, in, dry, chains, in, inverted, cup, shaped, bodies, embedded, in, host, tissue, these, aeciospores, then, infect, the, second, host, known, as, the, primary, or, asexual, host, in, macrocyclic, rusts, on, the, primary, host, a, repeating, spore, stage, is, formed, numbered, ii, the, urediospores, in, dry, pustules, called, uredinia, urediospores, are, dikaryotic, and, can, infect, the, same, host, that, produced, them, they, repeatedly, infect, this, host, over, the, growing, season, at, the, end, of, the, season, a, fourth, spore, type, the, teliospore, is, formed, it, is, thicker, walled, and, serves, to, overwinter, or, to, survive, other, harsh, conditions, it, does, not, continue, the, infection, process, rather, it, remains, dormant, for, a, period, and, then, germinates, to, form, basidia, stage, iv, sometimes, called, a, promycelium, in, the, pucciniales, the, basidia, are, cylindrical, and, become, 3, septate, after, meiosis, with, each, of, the, 4, cells, bearing, one, basidiospore, each, the, basidiospores, disperse, and, start, the, infection, process, on, host, 1, again, autoecious, rusts, complete, their, life, cycles, on, one, host, instead, of, two, and, microcyclic, rusts, cut, out, one, or, more, stages, the, characteristic, part, of, the, life, cycle, of, smuts, is, the, thick, walled, often, darkly, pigmented, ornate, teliospore, that, serves, to, survive, harsh, conditions, such, as, overwintering, and, also, serves, to, help, disperse, the, fungus, as, dry, diaspores, the, teliospores, are, initially, dikaryotic, but, become, diploid, via, karyogamy, meiosis, takes, place, at, the, time, of, germination, a, promycelium, is, formed, that, consists, of, a, short, hypha, equated, to, a, basidium, in, some, smuts, such, as, mycosarcoma, maydis, the, nuclei, migrate, into, the, promycelium, that, becomes, septate, i, e, divided, into, cellular, compartments, separated, by, cell, walls, called, septa, and, haploid, yeast, like, conidia, basidiospores, sometimes, called, sporidia, bud, off, laterally, from, each, cell, in, various, smuts, the, yeast, phase, may, proliferate, or, they, may, fuse, or, they, may, infect, plant, tissue, and, become, hyphal, in, other, smuts, such, as, tilletia, caries, the, elongated, haploid, basidiospores, form, apically, often, in, compatible, pairs, that, fuse, centrally, resulting, in, h, shaped, diaspores, which, are, by, then, dikaryotic, dikaryotic, conidia, may, then, form, eventually, the, host, is, infected, by, infectious, hyphae, teliospores, form, in, host, tissue, many, variations, on, these, general, themes, occur, smuts, with, both, a, yeast, phase, and, an, infectious, hyphal, state, are, examples, of, dimorphic, basidiomycota, in, plant, parasitic, taxa, the, saprotrophic, phase, is, normally, the, yeast, while, the, infectious, stage, is, hyphal, however, there, are, examples, of, animal, and, human, parasites, where, the, species, are, dimorphic, but, it, is, the, yeast, like, state, that, is, infectious, the, genus, filobasidiella, forms, basidia, on, hyphae, but, the, main, infectious, stage, is, more, commonly, known, by, the, anamorphic, yeast, name, cryptococcus, e, g, cryptococcus, neoformans, and, cryptococcus, gattii, the, dimorphic, basidiomycota, with, yeast, stages, and, the, pleiomorphic, rusts, are, examples, of, fungi, with, anamorphs, which, are, the, asexual, stages, some, basidiomycota, are, only, known, as, anamorphs, many, are, yeasts, collectively, called, basidiomycetous, yeasts, to, differentiate, them, from, ascomycetous, yeasts, in, the, ascomycota, aside, from, yeast, anamorphs, and, uredinia, aecia, and, pycnidia, some, basidiomycota, form, other, distinctive, anamorphs, as, parts, of, their, life, cycles, examples, are, collybia, tuberosa, with, its, apple, seed, shaped, and, coloured, sclerotium, dendrocollybia, racemosa, with, its, sclerotium, and, its, tilachlidiopsis, racemosa, conidia, armillaria, with, their, rhizomorphs, hohenbuehelia, with, their, nematoctonus, nematode, infectious, state, and, the, coffee, leaf, parasite, mycena, citricolor, and, its, decapitatus, flavidus, propagules, called, gemmae
