the, coyote, canis, latrans, also, known, as, the, american, jackal, prairie, wolf, or, brush, wolf, is, a, species, of, canine, native, to, north, america, it, is, smaller, than, its, close, relative, the, gray, wolf, and, slightly, smaller, than, the, closely, related, eastern, wolf, and, red, wolf, it, fills, much, of, the, same, ecological, niche, as, the, golden, jackal, does, in, eurasia, however, the, coyote, is, generally, larger, the, coyote, is, listed, as, least, concern, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, due, to, its, wide, distribution, and, abundance, throughout, north, america, the, species, is, versatile, able, to, adapt, to, and, expand, into, environments, modified, by, humans, urban, coyotes, are, common, in, many, cities, the, coyote, was, sighted, in, eastern, panama, across, the, panama, canal, from, their, home, range, for, the, first, time, in, 2013, the, coyote, has, 19, recognized, subspecies, the, average, male, weighs, 8, to, 20, kg, 18, to, 44, lb, and, the, average, female, 7, to, 18, kg, 15, to, 40, lb, their, fur, color, is, predominantly, light, gray, and, red, or, fulvous, interspersed, with, black, and, white, though, it, varies, somewhat, with, geography, it, is, highly, flexible, in, social, organization, living, either, in, a, family, unit, or, in, loosely, knit, packs, of, unrelated, individuals, primarily, carnivorous, its, diet, consists, mainly, of, deer, rabbits, hares, rodents, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and, invertebrates, though, it, may, also, eat, fruits, and, vegetables, on, occasion, its, characteristic, vocalization, is, a, howl, made, by, solitary, individuals, humans, are, the, coyote, s, greatest, threat, followed, by, cougars, and, gray, wolves, despite, predation, by, gray, wolves, coyotes, sometimes, mate, with, them, and, with, eastern, or, red, wolves, producing, coywolf, hybrids, in, the, northeastern, regions, of, north, america, the, eastern, coyote, a, larger, subspecies, though, still, smaller, than, wolves, is, the, result, of, various, historical, and, recent, matings, with, various, types, of, wolves, genetic, studies, show, that, most, north, american, wolves, contain, some, level, of, coyote, dna, the, coyote, is, a, prominent, character, in, native, american, folklore, mainly, in, aridoamerica, usually, depicted, as, a, trickster, that, alternately, assumes, the, form, of, an, actual, coyote, or, a, man, as, with, other, trickster, figures, the, coyote, uses, deception, and, humor, to, rebel, against, social, conventions, the, animal, was, especially, respected, in, mesoamerican, cosmology, as, a, symbol, of, military, might, after, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, it, was, seen, in, anglo, american, culture, as, a, cowardly, and, untrustworthy, animal, unlike, wolves, which, have, seen, their, public, image, improve, attitudes, towards, the, coyote, remain, largely, negative, coyote, males, average, 8, to, 20, kg, 18, to, 44, lb, in, weight, while, females, average, 7, to, 18, kg, 15, to, 40, lb, though, size, varies, geographically, northern, subspecies, which, average, 18, kg, 40, lb, tend, to, grow, larger, than, the, southern, subspecies, of, mexico, which, average, 11, 5, kg, 25, lb, total, length, ranges, on, average, from, 1, 0, to, 1, 35, m, 3, ft, 3, in, to, 4, ft, 5, in, comprising, a, tail, length, of, 40, cm, 16, in, with, females, being, shorter, in, both, body, length, and, height, the, largest, coyote, on, record, was, a, male, killed, near, afton, wyoming, on, november, 19, 1937, which, measured, 1, 5, m, 4, ft, 11, in, from, nose, to, tail, and, weighed, 34, kg, 75, lb, scent, glands, are, located, at, the, upper, side, of, the, base, of, the, tail, and, are, a, bluish, black, color, the, color, and, texture, of, the, coyote, s, fur, vary, somewhat, geographically, the, hair, s, predominant, color, is, light, gray, and, red, or, fulvous, interspersed, around, the, body, with, black, and, white, coyotes, living, at, high, elevations, tend, to, have, more, black, and, gray, shades, than, their, desert, dwelling, counterparts, which, are, more, fulvous, or, whitish, gray, the, coyote, s, fur, consists, of, short, soft, underfur, and, long, coarse, guard, hairs, the, fur, of, northern, subspecies, is, longer, and, denser, than, in, southern, forms, with, the, fur, of, some, mexican, and, central, american, forms, being, almost, hispid, bristly, generally, adult, coyotes, including, coywolf, hybrids, have, a, sable, coat, color, dark, neonatal, coat, color, bushy, tail, with, an, active, supracaudal, gland, and, a, white, facial, mask, albinism, is, extremely, rare, in, coyotes, out, of, a, total, of, 750, 000, coyotes, killed, by, federal, and, cooperative, hunters, between, march, 1938, and, june, 1945, only, two, were, albinos, the, coyote, is, typically, smaller, than, the, gray, wolf, but, has, longer, ears, and, a, relatively, larger, braincase, as, well, as, a, thinner, frame, face, and, muzzle, the, scent, glands, are, smaller, than, the, gray, wolf, s, but, are, the, same, color, its, fur, color, variation, is, much, less, varied, than, that, of, a, wolf, the, coyote, also, carries, its, tail, downwards, when, running, or, walking, rather, than, horizontally, as, the, wolf, does, coyote, tracks, can, be, distinguished, from, those, of, dogs, by, their, more, elongated, less, rounded, shape, unlike, dogs, the, upper, canines, of, coyotes, extend, past, the, mental, foramina, at, the, time, of, the, european, colonization, of, the, americas, coyotes, were, largely, confined, to, open, plains, and, arid, regions, of, the, western, half, of, the, continent, in, early, post, columbian, historical, records, determining, whether, the, writer, is, describing, coyotes, or, wolves, is, often, difficult, one, record, from, 1750, in, kaskaskia, illinois, written, by, a, local, priest, noted, that, the, wolves, encountered, there, were, smaller, and, less, daring, than, european, wolves, another, account, from, the, early, 1800s, in, edwards, county, mentioned, wolves, howling, at, night, though, these, were, likely, coyotes, this, species, was, encountered, several, times, during, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, 1804, 1806, though, it, was, already, well, known, to, european, traders, on, the, upper, missouri, meriwether, lewis, writing, on, 5, may, 1805, in, northeastern, montana, described, the, coyote, in, these, terms, the, small, wolf, or, burrowing, dog, of, the, prairies, are, the, inhabitants, almost, invariably, of, the, open, plains, they, usually, associate, in, bands, of, ten, or, twelve, sometimes, more, and, burrow, near, some, pass, or, place, much, frequented, by, game, not, being, able, alone, to, take, deer, or, goat, they, are, rarely, ever, found, alone, but, hunt, in, bands, they, frequently, watch, and, seize, their, prey, near, their, burrows, in, these, burrows, they, raise, their, young, and, to, them, they, also, resort, when, pursued, when, a, person, approaches, them, they, frequently, bark, their, note, being, precisely, that, of, the, small, dog, they, are, of, an, intermediate, size, between, that, of, the, fox, and, dog, very, active, fleet, and, delicately, formed, the, ears, large, erect, and, pointed, the, head, long, and, pointed, more, like, that, of, the, fox, tale, long, the, hair, and, fur, also, resembles, the, fox, tho, is, much, coarser, and, inferior, they, are, of, a, pale, reddish, brown, colour, the, eye, of, a, deep, sea, green, colour, small, and, piercing, their, are, rather, longer, than, those, of, the, ordinary, wolf, or, that, common, to, the, atlantic, states, none, of, which, are, to, be, found, in, this, quarter, nor, i, believe, above, the, river, plat, the, coyote, was, first, scientifically, described, by, naturalist, thomas, say, in, september, 1819, on, the, site, of, lewis, and, clark, s, council, bluffs, 24, km, 15, mi, up, the, missouri, river, from, the, mouth, of, the, platte, during, a, government, sponsored, expedition, with, major, stephen, long, he, had, the, first, edition, of, the, lewis, and, clark, journals, in, hand, which, contained, biddle, s, edited, version, of, lewis, s, observations, dated, 5, may, 1805, his, account, was, published, in, 1823, say, was, the, first, person, to, document, the, difference, between, a, prairie, wolf, coyote, and, on, the, next, page, of, his, journal, a, wolf, which, he, named, canis, nubilus, great, plains, wolf, say, described, the, coyote, as, canis, latrans, cinereous, or, gray, varied, with, black, above, and, dull, fulvous, or, cinnamon, hair, at, base, dusky, plumbeous, in, the, middle, of, its, length, dull, cinnamon, and, at, tip, gray, or, black, longer, on, the, vertebral, line, ears, erect, rounded, at, tip, cinnamon, behind, the, hair, dark, plumbeous, at, base, inside, lined, with, gray, hair, eyelids, edged, with, black, superior, eyelashes, black, beneath, and, at, tip, above, supplemental, lid, margined, with, black, brown, before,

calcis, when, the, leg, is, extended, beneath, white, immaculate, tail, cinnamon, towards, the, tip, tip, black, posterior, feet, four, toed, anterior, five, toed, the, first, published, usage, of, the, word, coyote, which, is, a, spanish, borrowing, of, its, nahuatl, name, coy, tl, pronunciation, comes, from, the, historian, francisco, javier, clavijero, s, historia, de, m, xico, in, 1780, the, first, time, it, was, used, in, english, occurred, in, william, bullock, s, six, months, residence, and, travels, in, mexico, 1824, where, it, is, variously, transcribed, as, cayjotte, and, cocyotie, the, word, s, spelling, was, standardized, as, coyote, by, the, 1880s, the, english, pronunciation, is, heard, both, as, a, two, syllable, word, with, the, final, e, silent, and, as, three, syllables, with, the, final, e, pronounced, with, a, tendency, for, the, three, syllable, pronunciation, in, eastern, states, and, near, the, mexican, border, and, outside, the, united, states, with, two, syllables, in, western, and, central, states, alternative, english, names, for, the, coyote, include, prairie, wolf, brush, wolf, cased, wolf, little, wolf, and, american, jackal, its, binomial, name, canis, latrans, translates, to, barking, dog, a, reference, to, the, many, vocalizations, they, produce, mescac, kanis, perro, de, monte, isapaipp, itsapp, sedet, domestic, dog, gray, wolf, coyote, african, wolf, golden, jackal, ethiopian, wolf, dhole, african, wild, dog, side, striped, jackal, black, backed, jackal, xiaoming, wang, and, richard, h, tedford, one, of, the, foremost, authorities, on, carnivore, evolution, proposed, that, the, genus, canis, was, the, descendant, of, the, coyote, like, eucyon, davisi, and, its, remains, first, appeared, in, the, miocene, 6, million, years, ago, mya, in, the, southwestern, us, and, mexico, by, the, pliocene, 5, mya, the, larger, canis, lepophagus, appeared, in, the, same, region, and, by, the, early, pleistocene, 1, mya, c, latrans, the, coyote, was, in, existence, they, proposed, that, the, progression, from, eucyon, davisi, to, c, lepophagus, to, the, coyote, was, linear, evolution, c, latrans, and, c, aureus, are, closely, related, to, c, edwardii, a, species, that, appeared, earliest, spanning, the, mid, blancan, late, pliocene, to, the, close, of, the, irvingtonian, late, pleistocene, and, coyote, remains, indistinguishable, from, c, latrans, were, contemporaneous, with, c, edwardii, in, north, america, johnston, describes, c, lepophagus, as, having, a, more, slender, skull, and, skeleton, than, the, modern, coyote, ronald, nowak, found, that, the, early, populations, had, small, delicate, narrowly, proportioned, skulls, that, resemble, small, coyotes, and, appear, to, be, ancestral, to, c, latrans, c, lepophagus, was, similar, in, weight, to, modern, coyotes, but, had, shorter, limb, bones, that, indicate, a, less, cursorial, lifestyle, the, coyote, represents, a, more, primitive, form, of, canis, than, the, gray, wolf, as, shown, by, its, relatively, small, size, and, its, comparatively, narrow, skull, and, jaws, which, lack, the, grasping, power, necessary, to, hold, the, large, prey, in, which, wolves, specialize, this, is, further, corroborated, by, the, coyote, s, sagittal, crest, which, is, low, or, totally, flattened, thus, indicating, a, weaker, bite, than, the, wolves, the, coyote, is, not, a, specialized, carnivore, as, the, wolf, is, as, shown, by, the, larger, chewing, surfaces, on, the, molars, reflecting, the, species, relative, dependence, on, vegetable, matter, in, these, respects, the, coyote, resembles, the, fox, like, progenitors, of, the, genus, more, so, than, the, wolf, the, oldest, fossils, that, fall, within, the, range, of, the, modern, coyote, date, to, 0, 74, 0, 85, ma, million, years, in, hamilton, cave, west, virginia, 0, 73, ma, in, irvington, california, 0, 35, 0, 48, ma, in, porcupine, cave, colorado, and, in, cumberland, cave, pennsylvania, modern, coyotes, arose, 1, 000, years, after, the, quaternary, extinction, event, compared, to, their, modern, holocene, counterparts, pleistocene, coyotes, c, l, orcutti, were, larger, and, more, robust, likely, in, response, to, larger, competitors, and, prey, pleistocene, coyotes, were, likely, more, specialized, carnivores, than, their, descendants, as, their, teeth, were, more, adapted, to, shearing, meat, showing, fewer, grinding, surfaces, suited, for, processing, vegetation, their, reduction, in, size, occurred, within, 1, 000, years, of, the, quaternary, extinction, event, when, their, large, prey, died, out, furthermore, pleistocene, coyotes, were, unable, to, exploit, the, big, game, hunting, niche, left, vacant, after, the, extinction, of, the, dire, wolf, aenocyon, dirus, as, it, was, rapidly, filled, by, gray, wolves, which, likely, actively, killed, off, the, large, coyotes, with, natural, selection, favoring, the, modern, gracile, morph, in, 1993, a, study, proposed, that, the, wolves, of, north, america, display, skull, traits, more, similar, to, the, coyote, than, wolves, from, eurasia, in, 2010, a, study, found, that, the, coyote, was, a, basal, member, of, the, clade, that, included, the, tibetan, wolf, the, domestic, dog, the, mongolian, wolf, and, the, eurasian, wolf, with, the, tibetan, wolf, diverging, early, from, wolves, and, domestic, dogs, in, 2016, a, whole, genome, dna, study, proposed, based, on, the, assumptions, made, that, all, of, the, north, american, wolves, and, coyotes, diverged, from, a, common, ancestor, about, 51, 000, years, ago, however, the, proposed, timing, of, the, wolf, coyote, divergence, conflicts, with, the, discovery, of, a, coyote, like, specimen, in, strata, dated, to, 1, mya, the, study, also, indicated, that, all, north, american, wolves, have, a, significant, amount, of, coyote, ancestry, and, all, coyotes, some, degree, of, wolf, ancestry, and, that, the, red, wolf, and, eastern, wolf, are, highly, admixed, with, different, proportions, of, gray, wolf, and, coyote, ancestry, genetic, studies, relating, to, wolves, or, dogs, have, inferred, phylogenetic, relationships, based, on, the, only, reference, genome, available, that, of, the, boxer, dog, in, 2017, the, first, reference, genome, of, the, wolf, canis, lupus, lupus, was, mapped, to, aid, future, research, in, 2018, a, study, looked, at, the, genomic, structure, and, admixture, of, north, american, wolves, wolf, like, canids, and, coyotes, using, specimens, from, across, their, entire, range, that, mapped, the, largest, dataset, of, nuclear, genome, sequences, against, the, wolf, reference, genome, the, study, supports, the, findings, of, previous, studies, that, north, american, gray, wolves, and, wolf, like, canids, were, the, result, of, complex, gray, wolf, and, coyote, mixing, a, polar, wolf, from, greenland, and, a, coyote, from, mexico, represented, the, purest, specimens, the, coyotes, from, alaska, california, alabama, and, quebec, show, almost, no, wolf, ancestry, coyotes, from, missouri, illinois, and, florida, exhibit, 5, 10, wolf, ancestry, there, was, 40, wolf, to, 60, coyote, ancestry, in, red, wolves, 60, wolf, to, 40, coyote, in, eastern, timber, wolves, and, 75, wolf, to, 25, coyote, in, the, great, lakes, wolves, there, was, 10, coyote, ancestry, in, mexican, wolves, and, the, atlantic, coast, wolves, 5, in, pacific, coast, and, yellowstone, wolves, and, less, than, 3, in, canadian, archipelago, wolves, if, a, third, canid, had, been, involved, in, the, admixture, of, the, north, american, wolf, like, canids, then, its, genetic, signature, would, have, been, found, in, coyotes, and, wolves, which, it, has, not, in, 2018, whole, genome, sequencing, was, used, to, compare, members, of, the, genus, canis, the, study, indicates, that, the, common, ancestor, of, the, coyote, and, gray, wolf, has, genetically, admixed, with, a, ghost, population, of, an, extinct, unidentified, canid, the, ghost, canid, was, genetically, close, to, the, dhole, and, had, evolved, after, the, divergence, of, the, african, wild, dog, from, the, other, canid, species, the, basal, position, of, the, coyote, compared, to, the, wolf, is, proposed, to, be, due, to, the, coyote, retaining, more, of, the, mitochondrial, genome, from, the, unknown, extinct, canid, as, of, 2005, 19, subspecies, are, recognized, geographic, variation, in, coyotes, is, not, great, though, taken, as, a, whole, the, eastern, subspecies, c, l, thamnos, and, c, l, frustor, are, large, dark, colored, animals, with, a, gradual, paling, in, color, and, reduction, in, size, westward, and, northward, c, l, texensis, c, l, latrans, c, l, lestes, and, c, l, incolatus, a, brightening, of, ochraceous, tones, deep, orange, or, brown, towards, the, pacific, coast, c, l, ochropus, c, l, umpquensis, a, reduction, in, size, in, aridoamerica, c, l, microdon, c, l, mearnsi, and, a, general, trend, towards, dark, reddish, colors, and, short, muzzles, in, mexican, and, central, american, populations, coyotes, occasionally, mate, with, domestic, dogs, sometimes, producing, crosses, colloquially, known, as, coydogs, such, matings, are, rare, in, the, wild, as, the, mating, cycles, of, dogs, and, coyotes, do, not, coincide, and, coyotes, are, usually, antagonistic, towards, dogs, hybridization, usually, only, occurs, when, coyotes, are, expanding, into, areas, where, conspecifics, are, few, and, dogs, are, the, only, alternatives, even, then, pup, survival, rates, are, lower, than, normal, as, dogs, do, not, form, pair, bonds, with, coyotes, thus, making, the, rearing, of, pups, more, difficult, in, captivity, f, 1, hybrids, first, generation, tend, to, be, more, mischievous, and, less, manageable, as, pups, than, dogs, and, are, less, trustworthy, on, maturity, than, wolf, dog, hybrids, hybrids, vary, in, appearance, but, generally, retain, the, coyote, s, usual, characteristics, f, 1, hybrids, tend, to, be, intermediate, in, form, between, dogs, and, coyotes, while, f, 2, hybrids, second, generation, are, more, varied, both, f, 1, and, f, 2, hybrids, resemble, their, coyote, parents, in, terms, of, shyness, and, intrasexual, aggression, hybrids, are, fertile, and, can, be, successfully, bred, through, four, generations, melanistic, coyotes, owe, their, black, pelts, to, a, mutation, that, first, arose, in, domestic, dogs, a, population, of, non, albino, white, coyotes, in, newfoundland, owe, their, coloration, to, a, melanocortin, 1, receptor, mutation, inherited, from, golden, retrievers, coyotes, have, hybridized, with, wolves, to, varying, degrees, particularly, in, eastern, north, america, the, so, called, eastern, coyote, of, northeastern, north, america, probably, originated, in, the, aftermath, of, the, extermination, of, gray, and, eastern, wolves, in, the, northeast, thus, allowing, coyotes, to, colonize, former, wolf, ranges, and, mix, with, the, remnant, wolf, populations, this, hybrid, is, smaller, than, either, the, gray, or, eastern, wolf, and, holds, smaller, territories, but, is, in, turn, larger, and, holds, more, extensive, home, ranges, than, the, typical, western, coyote, as, of, 2010, the, eastern, coyote, s, genetic, makeup, is, fairly, uniform, with, minimal, influence, from, eastern, wolves, or, western, coyotes, adult, eastern, coyotes, are, larger, than, western, coyotes, with, female, eastern, coyotes, weighing, 21, more, than, male, western, coyotes, physical, differences, become, more, apparent, by, the, age, of, 35, days, with, eastern, coyote, pups, having, longer, legs, than, their, western, counterparts, differences, in, dental, development, also, occurs, with, tooth, eruption, being, later, and, in, a, different, order, in, the, eastern, coyote, aside, from, its, size, the, eastern, coyote, is, physically, similar, to, the, western, coyote, the, four, color, phases, range, from, dark, brown, to, blond, or, reddish, blond, though, the, most, common, phase, is, gray, brown, with, reddish, legs, ears, and, flanks, no, significant, differences, exist, between, eastern, and, western, coyotes, in, aggression, and, fighting, though, eastern, coyotes, tend, to, fight, less, and, are, more, playful, unlike, western, coyote, pups, in, which, fighting, precedes, play, behavior, fighting, among, eastern, coyote, pups, occurs, after, the, onset, of, play, eastern, coyotes, tend, to, reach, sexual, maturity, at, two, years, of, age, much, later, than, in, western, coyotes, eastern, and, red, wolves, are, also, products, of, varying, degrees, of, wolf, coyote, hybridization, the, eastern, wolf, probably, was, a, result, of, a, wolf, coyote, admixture, combined, with, extensive, backcrossing, with, parent, gray, wolf, populations, the, red, wolf, may, have, originated, during, a, time, of, declining, wolf, populations, in, the, southeastern, woodlands, forcing, a, wolf, coyote, hybridization, as, well, as, backcrossing, with, local, parent, coyote, populations, to, the, extent, that, about, 75, 80, of, the, modern, red, wolf, s, genome, is, of, coyote, derivation, like, the, eurasian, golden, jackal, the, coyote, is, gregarious, but, not, as, dependent, on, conspecifics, as, more, social, canid, species, like, wolves, are, this, is, likely, because, the, coyote, is, not, a, specialized, hunter, of, large, prey, as, the, latter, species, is, the, basic, social, unit, of, a, coyote, pack, is, a, family, containing, a, reproductive, female, however, unrelated, coyotes, may, join, forces, for, companionship, or, to, bring, down, prey, too, large, to, attack, on, their, own, such, nonfamily, packs, are, only, temporary, and, may, consist, of, bachelor, males, nonreproductive, females, and, subadult, young, families, are, formed, in, midwinter, when, females, enter, estrus, pair, bonding, can, occur, 2, 3, months, before, actual, copulation, takes, place, the, copulatory, tie, can, last, 5, 45, minutes, a, female, entering, estrus, attracts, males, by, scent, marking, and, howling, with, increasing, frequency, a, single, female, in, heat, can, attract, up, to, seven, reproductive, males, which, can, follow, her, for, as, long, as, a, month, although, some, squabbling, may, occur, among, the, males, once, the, female, has, selected, a, mate, and, copulates, the, rejected, males, do, not, intervene, and, move, on, once, they, detect, other, estrous, females, unlike, the, wolf, which, has, been, known, to, practice, both, monogamous, and, bigamous, matings, the, coyote, is, strictly, monogamous, even, in, areas, with, high, coyote, densities, and, abundant, food, females, that, fail, to, mate, sometimes, assist, their, sisters, or, mothers, in, raising, their, pups, or, join, their, siblings, until, the, next, time, they, can, mate, the, newly, mated, pair, then, establishes, a, territory, and, either, constructs, their, own, den, or, cleans, out, abandoned, badger, marmot, or, skunk, earths, during, the, pregnancy, the, male, frequently, hunts, alone, and, brings, back, food, for, the, female, the, female, may, line, the, den, with, dried, grass, or, with, fur, pulled, from, her, belly, the, gestation, period, is, 63, days, with, an, average, litter, size, of, six, though, the, number, fluctuates, depending, on, coyote, population, density, and, the, abundance, of, food, coyote, pups, are, born, in, dens, hollow, trees, or, under, ledges, and, weigh, 200, to, 500, g, 0, 44, to, 1, 10, lb, at, birth, they, are, altricial, and, are, completely, dependent, on, milk, for, their, first, 10, days, the, incisors, erupt, at, about, 12, days, the, canines, at, 16, and, the, second, premolars, at, 21, their, eyes, open, after, 10, days, by, which, point, the, pups, become, increasingly, more, mobile, walking, by, 20, days, and, running, at, the, age, of, six, weeks, the, parents, begin, supplementing, the, pup, s, diet, with, regurgitated, solid, food, after, 12, 15, days, by, the, age, of, four, to, six, weeks, when, their, milk, teeth, are, fully, functional, the, pups, are, given, small, food, items, such, as, mice, rabbits, or, pieces, of, ungulate, carcasses, with, lactation, steadily, decreasing, after, two, months, unlike, wolf, pups, coyote, pups, begin, seriously, fighting, as, opposed, to, play, fighting, prior, to, engaging, in, play, behavior, a, common, play, behavior, includes, the, coyote, hip, slam, by, three, weeks, of, age, coyote, pups, bite, each, other, with, less, inhibition, than, wolf, pups, by, the, age, of, four, to, five, weeks, pups, have, established, dominance, hierarchies, and, are, by, then, more, likely, to, play, rather, than, fight, the, male, plays, an, active, role, in, feeding, grooming, and, guarding, the, pups, but, abandons, them, if, the, female, goes, missing, before, the, pups, are, completely, weaned, the, den, is, abandoned, by, june, to, july, and, the, pups, follow, their, parents, in, patrolling, their, territory, and, hunting, pups, may, leave, their, families, in, august, though, can, remain, for, much, longer, the, pups, attain, adult, dimensions, at, eight, months, and, gain, adult, weight, a, month, later, individual, feeding, territories, vary, in, size, from, 0, 4, to, 62, km, 2, 0, 15, to, 24, sq, mi, with, the, general, concentration, of, coyotes, in, a, given, area, depending, on, food, abundance, adequate, denning, sites, and, competition, with, conspecifics, and, other, predators, the, coyote, generally, does, not, defend, its, territory, outside, of, the, denning, season, and, is, much, less, aggressive, towards, intruders, than, the, wolf, is, typically, chasing, and, sparring, with, them, but, rarely, killing, them, conflicts, between, coyotes, can, arise, during, times, of, food, shortage, coyotes, mark, their, territories, by, raised, leg, urination, and, ground, scratching, like, wolves, coyotes, use, a, den, usually, the, deserted, holes, of, other, species, when, gestating, and, rearing, young, though, they, may, occasionally, give, birth, under, sagebrushes, in, the, open, coyote, dens, can, be, located, in, canyons, washouts, coulees, banks, rock, bluffs, or, level, ground, some, dens, have, been, found, under, abandoned, homestead, shacks, grain, bins, drainage, pipes, railroad, tracks, hollow, logs, thickets, and, thistles, the, den, is, continuously, dug, and, cleaned, out, by, the, female, until, the, pups, are, born, should, the, den, be, disturbed, or, infested, with, fleas, the, pups, are, moved, into, another, den, a, coyote, den, can, have, several, entrances, and, passages, branching, out, from, the, main, chamber, a, single, den, can, be, used, year, after, year, while, the, popular, consensus, is, that, olfaction, is, very, important, for, hunting, two, studies, that, experimentally, investigated, the, role, of, olfactory, auditory, and, visual, cues, found, that, visual, cues, are, the, most, important, ones, for, hunting, in, red, foxes, and, coyotes, when, hunting, large, prey, the, coyote, often, works, in, pairs, or, small, groups, success, in, killing, large, ungulates, depends, on, factors, such, as, snow, depth, and, crust, density, younger, animals, usually, avoid, participating, in, such, hunts, with, the, breeding, pair, typically, doing, most, of, the, work, the, coyote, pursues, large, prey, typically, hamstringing, the, animal, and, subsequently, then, harassing, it, until, the, prey, falls, like, other, canids, the, coyote, caches, excess, food, coyotes, catch, mouse, sized, rodents, by, pouncing, whereas, ground, squirrels, are, chased, although, coyotes, can, live, in, large, groups, small, prey, is, typically, caught, singly, coyotes, have, been, observed, to, kill, porcupines, in, pairs, using, their, paws, to, flip, the, rodents, on, their, backs, then, attacking, the, soft, underbelly, only, old, and, experienced, coyotes, can, successfully, prey, on, porcupines, with, many, predation, attempts, by, young, coyotes, resulting, in, them, being, injured, by, their, prey, s, quills, coyotes, sometimes, urinate, on, their, food, possibly, to, claim, ownership, over, it, recent, evidence, demonstrates, that, at, least, some, coyotes, have, become, more, nocturnal, in, hunting, presumably, to, avoid, humans, coyotes, may, occasionally, form, mutualistic, hunting, relationships, with, american, badgers, assisting, each, other, in, digging, up, rodent, prey, the, relationship, between, the, two, species, may, occasionally, border, on, apparent, friendship, as, some, coyotes, have, been, observed, laying, their, heads, on, their, badger, companions, or, licking, their, faces, without, protest, the, amicable, interactions, between, coyotes, and, badgers, were, known, to, pre, columbian, civilizations, as, shown, on, a, jar, found, in, mexico, dated, to, 1250, 1300, ce, depicting, the, relationship, between, the, two, food, scraps, pet, food, and, animal, feces, may, attract, a, coyote, to, a, trash, can, being, both, a, gregarious, and, solitary, animal, the, variability, of, the, coyote, s, visual, and, vocal, repertoire, is, intermediate, between, that, of, the, solitary, foxes, and, the, highly, social, wolf, the, aggressive, behavior, of, the, coyote, bears, more, similarities, to, that, of, foxes, than, it, does, that, of, wolves, and, dogs, an, aggressive, coyote, arches, its, back, and, lowers, its, tail, unlike, dogs, which, solicit, playful, behavior, by, performing, a, play, bow, followed, by, a, play, leap, play, in, coyotes, consists, of, a, bow, followed, by, side, to, side, head, flexions, and, a, series, of, spins, and, dives, although, coyotes, will, sometimes, bite, their, playmates, scruff, as, dogs, do, they, typically, approach, low, and, make, upward, directed, bites, pups, fight, each, other, regardless, of, sex, while, among, adults, aggression, is, typically, reserved, for, members, of, the, same, sex, combatants, approach, each, other, waving, their, tails, and, snarling, with, their, jaws, open, though, fights, are, typically, silent, males, tend, to, fight, in, a, vertical, stance, while, females, fight, on, all, four, paws, fights, among, females, tend, to, be, more, serious, than, ones, among, males, as, females, seize, their, opponents, forelegs, throat, and, shoulders, the, coyote, has, been, described, as, the, most, vocal, of, all, north, american, mammals, its, loudness, and, range, of, vocalizations, was, the, cause, for, its, binomial, name, canis, latrans, meaning, barking, dog, at, least, 11, different, vocalizations, are, known, in, adult, coyotes, these, sounds, are, divided, into, three, categories, agonistic, and, alarm, greeting, and, contact, vocalizations, of, the, first, category, include, woofs, growls, huffs, barks, bark, howls, yelps, and, high, frequency, whines, woofs, are, used, as, low, intensity, threats, or, alarms, and, are, usually, heard, near, den, sites, prompting, the, pups, to, immediately, retreat, into, their, burrows, growls, are, used, as, threats, at, short, distances, but, have, also, been, heard, among, pups, playing, and, copulating, males, huffs, are, high, intensity, threat, vocalizations, produced, by, rapid, expiration, of, air, barks, can, be, classed, as, both, long, distance, threat, vocalizations, and, alarm, calls, bark, howls, may, serve, similar, functions, yelps, are, emitted, as, a, sign, of, submission, while, high, frequency, whines, are, produced, by, dominant, animals, acknowledging, the, submission, of, subordinates, greeting, vocalizations, include, low, frequency, whines, wow, oo, wows, and, group, yip, howls, low, frequency, whines, are, emitted, by, submissive, animals, and, are, usually, accompanied, by, tail, wagging, and, muzzle, nibbling, the, sound, known, as, wow, oo, wow, has, been, described, as, a, greeting, song, the, group, yip, howl, is, emitted, when, two, or, more, pack, members, reunite, and, may, be, the, final, act, of, a, complex, greeting, ceremony, contact, calls, include, lone, howls, and, group, howls, as, well, as, the, previously, mentioned, group, yip, howls, the, lone, howl, is, the, most, iconic, sound, of, the, coyote, and, may, serve, the, purpose, of, announcing, the, presence, of, a, lone, individual, separated, from, its, pack, group, howls, are, used, as, both, substitute, group, yip, howls, and, as, responses, to, either, lone, howls, group, howls, or, group, yip, howls, prior, to, the, near, extermination, of, wolves, and, cougars, the, coyote, was, most, numerous, in, grasslands, inhabited, by, bison, pronghorn, elk, and, other, deer, doing, particularly, well, in, short, grass, areas, with, prairie, dogs, though, it, was, just, as, much, at, home, in, semiarid, areas, with, sagebrush, and, jackrabbits, or, in, deserts, inhabited, by, cactus, kangaroo, rats, and, rattlesnakes, as, long, as, it, was, not, in, direct, competition, with, the, wolf, the, coyote, ranged, from, the, sonoran, desert, to, the, alpine, regions, of, adjoining, mountains, or, the, plains, and, mountainous, areas, of, alberta, with, the, extermination, of, the, wolf, the, coyote, s, range, expanded, to, encompass, broken, forests, from, the, tropics, of, guatemala, and, the, northern, slope, of, alaska, coyotes, walk, around, 5, 16, kilometres, 3, 10, mi, per, day, often, along, trails, such, as, logging, roads, and, paths, they, may, use, iced, over, rivers, as, travel, routes, in, winter, they, are, often, crepuscular, being, more, active, around, evening, and, the, beginning, of, the, night, than, during, the, day, however, in, urban, areas, coyotes, are, known, to, be, more, nocturnal, likely, to, avoid, encounters, with, humans, like, many, canids, coyotes, are, competent, swimmers, reported, to, be, able, to, travel, at, least, 0, 8, kilometres, 0, 5, mi, across, water, the, coyote, is, ecologically, the, north, american, equivalent, of, the, eurasian, golden, jackal, likewise, the, coyote, is, highly, versatile, in, its, choice, of, food, but, is, primarily, carnivorous, with, 90, of, its, diet, consisting, of, meat, prey, species, include, bison, largely, as, carrion, white, tailed, deer, mule, deer, moose, elk, bighorn, sheep, pronghorn, rabbits, hares, rodents, birds, especially, galliformes, roadrunners, young, water, birds, and, pigeons, and, doves, amphibians, except, toads, lizards, snakes, turtles, and, tortoises, fish, crustaceans, and, insects, coyotes, may, be, picky, over, the, prey, they, target, as, animals, such, as, shrews, moles, and, brown, rats, do, not, occur, in, their, diet, in, proportion, to, their, numbers, terrestrial, animals, or, burrowing, small, mammals, such, as, ground, squirrels, and, associated, species, marmots, prairie, dogs, chipmunks, as, well, as, voles, pocket, gophers, kangaroo, rats, and, other, ground, favoring, rodents, may, be, quite, common, foods, especially, for, lone, coyotes, examples, of, specific, primary, mammal, prey, include, eastern, cottontail, rabbits, thirteen, lined, ground, squirrels, and, white, footed, mice, more, unusual, prey, include, fishers, young, black, bear, cubs, harp, seals, and, rattlesnakes, coyotes, kill, rattlesnakes, mostly, for, food, but, also, to, protect, their, pups, at, their, dens, by, teasing, the, snakes, until, they, stretch, out, and, then, biting, their, heads, and, snapping, and, shaking, the, snakes, birds, taken, by, coyotes, may, range, in, size, from, thrashers, larks, and, sparrows, to, adult, wild, turkeys, and, rarely, brooding, adult, swans, and, pelicans, if, working, in, packs, or, pairs, coyotes, may, have, access, to, larger, prey, than, lone, individuals, normally, take, such, as, various, prey, weighing, more, than, 10, kg, 22, lb, in, some, cases, packs, of, coyotes, have, dispatched, much, larger, prey, such, as, adult, odocoileus, deer, cow, elk, pronghorns, and, wild, sheep, although, the, young, fawn, calves, and, lambs, of, these, animals, are, considerably, more, often, taken, even, by, packs, as, well, as, domestic, sheep, and, domestic, cattle, in, some, cases, coyotes, can, bring, down, prey, weighing, up, to, 100, to, 200, kg, 220, to, 440, lb, or, more, when, it, comes, to, adult, ungulates, such, as, wild, deer, they, often, exploit, them, when, vulnerable, such, as, those, that, are, infirm, stuck, in, snow, or, ice, otherwise, winter, weakened, or, heavily, pregnant, whereas, less, wary, domestic, ungulates, may, be, more, easily, exploited, although, coyotes, prefer, fresh, meat, they, will, scavenge, when, the, opportunity, presents, itself, excluding, the, insects, fruit, and, grass, eaten, the, coyote, requires, an, estimated, 600, g, 1, 3, lb, of, food, daily, or, 250, kg, 550, lb, annually, the, coyote, readily, cannibalizes, the, carcasses, of, conspecifics, with, coyote, fat, having, been, successfully, used, by, coyote, hunters, as, a, lure, or, poisoned, bait, the, coyote, s, winter, diet, consists, mainly, of, large, ungulate, carcasses, with, very, little, plant, matter, rodent, prey, increases, in, importance, during, the, spring, summer, and, fall, the, coyote, feeds, on, a, variety, of, different, produce, including, strawberries, blackberries, blueberries, sarsaparillas, peaches, pears, apples, prickly, pears, chapotes, persimmons, peanuts, watermelons, cantaloupes, and, carrots, during, the, winter, and, early, spring, the, coyote, eats, large, quantities, of, grass, such, as, green, wheat, blades, it, sometimes, eats, unusual, items, such, as, cotton, cake, soybean, meal, domestic, animal, droppings, beans, and, cultivated, grain, such, as, maize, wheat, and, sorghum, in, coastal, california, coyotes, now, consume, a, higher, percentage, of, marine, based, food, than, their, ancestors, which, is, thought, to, be, due, to, the, extirpation, of, the, grizzly, bear, from, this, region, in, death, valley, coyotes, may, consume, great, quantities, of, hawkmoth, caterpillars, or, beetles, in, the, spring, flowering, months, in, areas, where, the, ranges, of, coyotes, and, gray, wolves, overlap, interference, competition, and, predation, by, wolves, has, been, hypothesized, to, limit, local, coyote, densities, coyote, ranges, expanded, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, following, the, extirpation, of, wolves, while, coyotes, were, driven, to, extinction, on, isle, royale, after, wolves, colonized, the, island, in, the, 1940s, one, study, conducted, in, yellowstone, national, park, where, both, species, coexist, concluded, that, the, coyote, population, in, the, lamar, river, valley, declined, by, 39, following, the, reintroduction, of, wolves, in, the, 1990s, while, coyote, populations, in, wolf, inhabited, areas, of, the, grand, teton, national, park, are, 33, lower, than, in, areas, where, they, are, absent, wolves, have, been, observed, to, not, tolerate, coyotes, in, their, vicinity, though, coyotes, have, been, known, to, trail, wolves, to, feed, on, their, kills, coyotes, may, compete, with, cougars, in, some, areas, in, the, eastern, sierra, nevada, coyotes, compete, with, cougars, over, mule, deer, cougars, normally, outcompete, and, dominate, coyotes, and, may, kill, them, occasionally, thus, reducing, coyote, predation, pressure, on, smaller, carnivores, such, as, foxes, and, bobcats, coyotes, that, are, killed, are, sometimes, not, eaten, perhaps, indicating, that, these, comprise, competitive, interspecies, interactions, however, there, are, multiple, confirmed, cases, of, cougars, also, eating, coyotes, in, northeastern, mexico, cougar, predation, on, coyotes, continues, apace, but, coyotes, were, absent, from, the, prey, spectrum, of, sympatric, jaguars, apparently, due, to, differing, habitat, usages, other, than, by, gray, wolves, and, cougars, predation, on, adult, coyotes, is, relatively, rare, but, multiple, other, predators, can, be, occasional, threats, in, some, cases, adult, coyotes, have, been, preyed, upon, by, both, american, black, and, grizzly, bears, american, alligators, large, canada, lynx, and, golden, eagles, at, kill, sites, and, carrion, coyotes, especially, if, working, alone, tend, to, be, dominated, by, wolves, cougars, bears, wolverines, and, usually, but, not, always, eagles, i, e, bald, and, golden, when, such, larger, more, powerful, or, more, aggressive, predators, such, as, these, come, to, a, shared, feeding, site, a, coyote, may, either, try, to, fight, wait, until, the, other, predator, is, done, or, occasionally, share, a, kill, but, if, a, major, danger, such, as, wolves, or, an, adult, cougar, is, present, the, coyote, will, tend, to, flee, coyotes, rarely, kill, healthy, adult, red, foxes, and, have, been, observed, to, feed, or, den, alongside, them, though, they, often, kill, foxes, caught, in, traps, coyotes, may, kill, fox, kits, but, this, is, not, a, major, source, of, mortality, in, southern, california, coyotes, frequently, kill, gray, foxes, and, these, smaller, canids, tend, to, avoid, areas, with, high, coyote, densities, in, some, areas, coyotes, share, their, ranges, with, bobcats, these, two, similarly, sized, species, rarely, physically, confront, one, another, though, bobcat, populations, tend, to, diminish, in, areas, with, high, coyote, densities, however, several, studies, have, demonstrated, interference, competition, between, coyotes, and, bobcats, and, in, all, cases, coyotes, dominated, the, interaction, multiple, researchers, reported, instances, of, coyotes, killing, bobcats, whereas, bobcats, killing, coyotes, is, more, rare, coyotes, attack, bobcats, using, a, bite, and, shake, method, similar, to, what, is, used, on, medium, sized, prey, coyotes, both, single, individuals, and, groups, have, been, known, to, occasionally, kill, bobcats, in, most, cases, the, bobcats, were, relatively, small, specimens, such, as, adult, females, and, juveniles, coyote, attacks, by, an, unknown, number, of, coyotes, on, adult, male, bobcats, have, occurred, in, california, coyote, and, bobcat, populations, are, not, negatively, correlated, across, different, habitat, types, but, predation, by, coyotes, is, an, important, source, of, mortality, in, bobcats, biologist, stanley, paul, young, noted, that, in, his, entire, trapping, career, he, had, never, successfully, saved, a, captured, bobcat, from, being, killed, by, coyotes, and, wrote, of, two, incidents, wherein, coyotes, chased, bobcats, up, trees, coyotes, have, been, documented, to, directly, kill, canada, lynx, on, occasion, and, compete, with, them, for, prey, especially, snowshoe, hares, in, some, areas, including, central, alberta, lynx, are, more, abundant, where, coyotes, are, few, thus, interactions, with, coyotes, appears, to, influence, lynx, populations, more, than, the, availability, of, snowshoe, hares, due, to, the, coyote, s, wide, range, and, abundance, throughout, north, america, it, is, listed, as, least, concern, by, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, iucn, the, coyote, s, pre, columbian, range, was, limited, to, the, southwest, and, plains, regions, of, north, america, and, northern, and, central, mexico, by, the, 19th, century, the, species, expanded, north, and, east, expanding, further, after, 1900, coinciding, with, land, conversion, and, the, extirpation, of, wolves, by, this, time, its, range, encompassed, the, entire, north, american, continent, including, all, of, the, contiguous, united, states, and, mexico, southward, into, central, america, and, northward, into, most, of, canada, and, alaska, this, expansion, is, ongoing, and, the, species, now, occupies, the, majority, of, areas, between, 8, n, panama, and, 70, n, northern, alaska, although, it, was, once, widely, believed, that, coyotes, are, recent, immigrants, to, southern, mexico, and, central, america, aided, in, their, expansion, by, deforestation, pleistocene, and, early, holocene, records, as, well, as, records, from, the, pre, columbian, period, and, early, european, colonization, show, that, the, animal, was, present, in, the, area, long, before, modern, times, range, expansion, occurred, south, of, costa, rica, during, the, late, 1970s, and, northern, panama, in, the, early, 1980s, following, the, expansion, of, cattle, grazing, lands, into, tropical, rain, forests, the, coyote, is, predicted, to, appear, in, northern, belize, in, the, near, future, as, the, habitat, there, is, favorable, to, the, species, concerns, have, been, raised, of, a, possible, expansion, into, south, america, through, the, panamanian, isthmus, should, the, dari, n, gap, ever, be, closed, by, the, pan, american, highway, this, fear, was, partially, confirmed, in, january, 2013, when, the, species, was, recorded, in, eastern, panama, s, chepo, district, beyond, the, panama, canal, a, 2017, genetic, study, proposes, that, coyotes, were, originally, not, found, in, the, area, of, the, eastern, united, states, from, the, 1890s, dense, forests, were, transformed, into, agricultural, land, and, wolf, control, implemented, on, a, large, scale, leaving, a, niche, for, coyotes, to, disperse, into, there, were, two, major, dispersals, from, two, populations, of, genetically, distinct, coyotes, the, first, major, dispersal, to, the, northeast, came, in, the, early, 20th, century, from, those, coyotes, living, in, the, northern, great, plains, these, came, to, new, england, via, the, northern, great, lakes, region, and, southern, canada, and, to, pennsylvania, via, the, southern, great, lakes, region, meeting, together, in, the, 1940s, in, new, york, and, pennsylvania, these, coyotes, have, hybridized, with, the, remnant, gray, wolf, and, eastern, wolf, populations, which, has, added, to, coyote, genetic, diversity, and, may, have, assisted, adaptation, to, the, new, niche, the, second, major, dispersal, to, the, southeast, came, in, the, mid, 20th, century, from, texas, and, reached, the, carolinas, in, the, 1980s, these, coyotes, have, hybridized, with, the, remnant, red, wolf, populations, before, the, 1970s, when, the, red, wolf, was, extirpated, in, the, wild, which, has, also, added, to, coyote, genetic, diversity, and, may, have, assisted, adaptation, to, this, new, niche, as, well, both, of, these, two, major, coyote, dispersals, have, experienced, rapid, population, growth, and, are, forecast, to, meet, along, the, mid, atlantic, coast, the, study, concludes, that, for, coyotes, the, long, range, dispersal, gene, flow, from, local, populations, and, rapid, population, growth, may, be, inter, related, among, large, north, american, carnivores, the, coyote, probably, carries, the, largest, number, of, diseases, and, parasites, likely, due, to, its, wide, range, and, varied, diet, viral, diseases, known, to, infect, coyotes, include, rabies, canine, distemper, infectious, canine, hepatitis, four, strains, of, equine, encephalitis, and, oral, papillomatosis, by, the, late, 1970s, serious, rabies, outbreaks, in, coyotes, had, ceased, to, be, a, problem, for, over, 60, years, though, sporadic, cases, every, 1, 5, years, did, occur, distemper, causes, the, deaths, of, many, pups, in, the, wild, though, some, specimens, can, survive, infection, tularemia, a, bacterial, disease, infects, coyotes, from, tick, bites, and, through, their, rodent, and, lagomorph, prey, and, can, be, deadly, for, pups, coyotes, can, be, infected, by, both, demodectic, and, sarcoptic, mange, the, latter, being, the, most, common, mite, infestations, are, rare, and, incidental, in, coyotes, while, tick, infestations, are, more, common, with, seasonal, peaks, depending, on, locality, may, august, in, the, northwest, march, november, in, arkansas, coyotes, are, only, rarely, infested, with, lice, while, fleas, infest, coyotes, from, puphood, though, they, may, be, more, a, source, of, irritation, than, serious, illness, pulex, simulans, is, the, most, common, species, to, infest, coyotes, while, ctenocephalides, canis, tends, to, occur, only, in, places, where, coyotes, and, dogs, its, primary, host, inhabit, the, same, area, although, coyotes, are, rarely, host, to, flukes, they, can, nevertheless, have, serious, effects, on, coyotes, particularly, nanophyetus, salmincola, which, can, infect, them, with, salmon, poisoning, disease, a, disease, with, a, 90, mortality, rate, trematode, metorchis, conjunctus, can, also, infect, coyotes, tapeworms, have, been, recorded, to, infest, 60, 95, of, all, coyotes, examined, the, most, common, species, to, infest, coyotes, are, taenia, pisiformis, and, taenia, crassiceps, which, uses, cottontail, rabbits, and, rodents, as, intermediate, hosts, the, largest, species, known, in, coyotes, is, t, hydatigena, which, enters, coyotes, through, infected, ungulates, and, can, grow, to, lengths, of, 80, to, 400, cm, 31, to, 157, in, although, once, largely, limited, to, wolves, echinococcus, granulosus, has, expanded, to, coyotes, since, the, latter, began, colonizing, former,

teotihuacan, with, warriors, dressing, up, in, coyote, costumes, to, call, upon, its, predatory, power, the, species, continued, to, be, linked, to, central, mexican, warrior, cults, in, the, centuries, leading, up, to, the, post, classic, aztec, rule, in, aztec, mythology, huehuec, yotl, meaning, old, coyote, the, god, of, dance, music, and, carnality, is, depicted, in, several, codices,

brother, a, creator, seducer, trickster, and, culture, hero, linked, to, the, morning, star, coyote, attacks, on, humans, are, uncommon, and, rarely, cause, serious, injuries, due, to, the, relatively, small, size, of, the, coyote, but, have, been, increasingly, frequent, especially, in, california, by, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, the, coyote, was, already, marked, as, an, enemy, by, humans, sharp, hall, 1978, pg, 41, 54, there, have, been, only, two, confirmed, fatal, attacks, one, on, three, year, old, kelly, keen, in, glendale, california, and, another, on, nineteen, year, old, singer, songwriter, taylor, mitchell, in, nova, scotia, canada, in, the, 30, years, leading, up, to, march, 2006, at, least, 160, attacks, occurred, in, the, united, states, mostly, in, the, los, angeles, county, area, data, from, united, states, department, of, agriculture, usda, wildlife, services, the, california, department, of, fish, and, game, and, other, sources, show, that, while, 41, attacks, occurred, during, the, period, of, 1988, 1997, 48, attacks, were, verified, from, 1998, through, 2003, the, majority, of, these, incidents, occurred, in, southern, california, near, the, suburban, wildland, interface, in, the, absence, of, the, harassment, of, coyotes, practiced, by, rural, people, urban, coyotes, are, losing, their, fear, of, humans, which, is, further, worsened, by, people, intentionally, or, unintentionally, feeding, coyotes, in, such, situations, some, coyotes, have, begun, to, act, aggressively, toward, humans, chasing, joggers, and, bicyclists, confronting, people, walking, their, dogs, and, stalking, small, children, albeit, rarely, coyotes, in, these, areas, have, targeted, small, children, mostly, under, the, age, of, 10, though, some, adults, have, been, bitten, although, media, reports, of, such, attacks, generally, identify, the, animals, in, question, as, simply, coyotes, research, into, the, genetics, of, the, eastern, coyote, indicates, those, involved, in, attacks, in, northeast, north, america, including, pennsylvania, new, york, new, england, and, eastern, canada, may, have, actually, been, coywolves, hybrids, of, canis, latrans, and, c, lupus, not, fully, coyotes, as, of, 2007, coyotes, were, the, most, abundant, livestock, predators, in, western, north, america, causing, the, majority, of, sheep, goat, and, cattle, losses, for, example, according, to, the, national, agricultural, statistics, service, coyotes, were, responsible, for, 60, 5, of, the, 224, 000, sheep, deaths, attributed, to, predation, in, 2004, the, total, number, of, sheep, deaths, in, 2004, comprised, 2, 22, of, the, total, sheep, and, lamb, population, in, the, united, states, which, according, to, the, national, agricultural, statistics, service, usda, report, totaled, 4, 66, million, and, 7, 80, million, heads, respectively, as, of, july, 1, 2005, because, coyote, populations, are, typically, many, times, greater, and, more, widely, distributed, than, those, of, wolves, coyotes, cause, more, overall, predation, losses, united, states, government, agents, routinely, shoot, poison, trap, and, kill, about, 90, 000, coyotes, each, year, to, protect, livestock, an, idaho, census, taken, in, 2005, showed, that, individual, coyotes, were, 5, as, likely, to, attack, livestock, as, individual, wolves, in, utah, more, than, 11, 000, coyotes, were, killed, for, bounties, totaling, over, 500, 000, in, the, fiscal, year, ending, june, 30, 2017, livestock, guardian, dogs, are, commonly, used, to, aggressively, repel, predators, and, have, worked, well, in, both, fenced, pasture, and, range, operations, a, 1986, survey, of, sheep, producers, in, the, usa, found, that, 82, reported, the, use, of, dogs, represented, an, economic, asset, re, wilding, cattle, which, involves, increasing, the, natural, protective, tendencies, of, cattle, is, a, method, for, controlling, coyotes, discussed, by, temple, grandin, of, colorado, state, university, this, method, is, gaining, popularity, among, producers, who, allow, their, herds, to, calve, on, the, range, and, whose, cattle, graze, open, pastures, throughout, the, year, coyotes, typically, bite, the, throat, just, behind, the, jaw, and, below, the, ear, when, attacking, adult, sheep, or, goats, with, death, commonly, resulting, from, suffocation, blood, loss, is, usually, a, secondary, cause, of, death, calves, and, heavily, fleeced, sheep, are, killed, by, attacking, the, flanks, or, hindquarters, causing, shock, and, blood, loss, when, attacking, smaller, prey, such, as, young, lambs, the, kill, is, made, by, biting, the, skull, and, spinal, regions, causing, massive, tissue, and, bone, damage, small, or, young, prey, may, be, completely, carried, off, leaving, only, blood, as, evidence, of, a, kill, coyotes, usually, leave, the, hide, and, most, of, the, skeleton, of, larger, animals, relatively, intact, unless, food, is, scarce, in, which, case, they, may, leave, only, the, largest, bones, scattered, bits, of, wool, skin, and, other, parts, are, characteristic, where, coyotes, feed, extensively, on, larger, carcasses, tracks, are, an, important, factor, in, distinguishing, coyote, from, dog, predation, coyote, tracks, tend, to, be, more, oval, shaped, and, compact, than, those, of, domestic, dogs, and, their, claw, marks, are, less, prominent, and, the, tracks, tend, to, follow, a, straight, line, more, closely, than, those, of, dogs, with, the, exception, of, sighthounds, most, dogs, of, similar, weight, to, coyotes, have, a, slightly, shorter, stride, coyote, kills, can, be, distinguished, from, wolf, kills, by, less, damage, to, the, underlying, tissues, in, the, former, also, coyote, scat, tends, to, be, smaller, than, wolf, scat, coyotes, are, often, attracted, to, dog, food, and, animals, that, are, small, enough, to, appear, as, prey, items, such, as, garbage, pet, food, and, sometimes, feeding, stations, for, birds, and, squirrels, attract, coyotes, into, backyards, about, three, to, five, pets, attacked, by, coyotes, are, brought, into, the, animal, urgent, care, hospital, of, south, orange, county, california, each, week, the, majority, of, which, are, dogs, since, cats, typically, do, not, survive, the, attacks, scat, analysis, collected, near, claremont, california, revealed, that, coyotes, relied, heavily, on, pets, as, a, food, source, in, winter, and, spring, at, one, location, in, southern, california, coyotes, began, relying, on, a, colony, of, feral, cats, as, a, food, source, over, time, the, coyotes, killed, most, of, the, cats, and, then, continued, to, eat, the, cat, food, placed, daily, at, the, colony, site, by, people, who, were, maintaining, the, cat, colony, coyotes, usually, attack, smaller, sized, dogs, but, they, have, been, known, to, attack, even, large, powerful, breeds, such, as, the, rottweiler, in, exceptional, cases, dogs, larger, than, coyotes, such, as, greyhounds, are, generally, able, to, drive, them, off, and, have, been, known, to, kill, coyotes, smaller, breeds, are, more, likely, to, suffer, injury, or, death, coyote, hunting, is, one, of, the, most, common, forms, of, predator, hunting, that, humans, partake, in, there, are, not, many, regulations, with, regard, to, the, taking, of, the, coyote, which, means, there, are, many, different, methods, that, can, be, used, to, hunt, the, animal, the, most, common, forms, are, trapping, calling, and, hound, hunting, since, coyotes, are, colorblind, seeing, only, in, shades, of, gray, and, subtle, blues, open, camouflages, and, plain, patterns, can, be, used, as, the, average, male, coyote, weighs, 8, to, 20, kg, 18, to, 44, lbs, and, the, average, female, coyote, 7, to, 18, kg, 15, to, 40, lbs, a, universal, projectile, that, can, perform, between, those, weights, is, the, 223, remington, so, that, the, projectile, expands, in, the, target, after, entry, but, before, the, exit, thus, delivering, the, most, energy, coyotes, being, the, light, and, agile, animals, they, are, they, often, leave, a, very, light, impression, on, terrain, the, coyote, s, footprint, is, oblong, approximately, 6, 35, cm, 2, 5, inches, long, and, 5, 08, cm, 2, inches, wide, there, are, four, claws, in, both, their, front, and, hind, paws, the, coyote, s, center, pad, is, relatively, shaped, like, that, of, a, rounded, triangle, like, the, domestic, dog, the, coyote, s, front, paw, is, slightly, larger, than, the, hind, paw, the, coyote, s, paw, is, most, similar, to, that, of, the, domestic, dog, prior, to, the, mid, 19th, century, coyote, fur, was, considered, worthless, this, changed, with, the, diminution, of, beavers, and, by, 1860, the, hunting, of, coyotes, for, their, fur, became, a, great, source, of, income, 75, cents, to, 1, 50, per, skin, for, wolfers, in, the, great, plains, coyote, pelts, were, of, significant, economic, importance, during, the, early, 1950s, ranging, in, price, from, 5, to, 25, per, pelt, depending, on, locality, the, coyote, s, fur, is, not, durable, enough, to, make, rugs, but, can, be, used, for, coats, and, jackets, scarves, or, muffs, the, majority, of, pelts, are, used, for, making, trimmings, such, as, coat, collars, and, sleeves, for, women, s, clothing, coyote, fur, is, sometimes, dyed, black, as, imitation, silver, fox, coyotes, were, occasionally, eaten, by, trappers, and, mountain, men, during, the, western, expansion, coyotes, sometimes, featured, in, the, feasts, of, the, plains, indians, and, coyote, pups, were, eaten, by, the, indigenous, people, of, san, gabriel, california, the, taste, of, coyote, meat, has, been, likened, to, that, of, the, wolf, and, is, more, tender, than, pork, when, boiled, coyote, fat, when, taken, in, the, fall, has, been, used, on, occasion, to, grease, leather, or, eaten, as, a, spread, coyotes, were, likely, semidomesticated, by, various, pre, columbian, cultures, some, 19th, century, writers, wrote, of, coyotes, being, kept, in, native, villages, in, the, great, plains, the, coyote, is, easily, tamed, as, a, pup, but, can, become, destructive, as, an, adult, both, full, blooded, and, hybrid, coyotes, can, be, playful, and, confiding, with, their, owners, but, are, suspicious, and, shy, of, strangers, though, coyotes, being, tractable, enough, to, be, used, for, practical, purposes, like, retrieving, and, pointing, have, been, recorded, a, tame, coyote, named, butch, caught, in, the, summer, of, 1945, had, a, short, lived, career, in, cinema, appearing, in, smoky, 1946, and, ramrod, 1947, before, being, shot, while, raiding, a, henhouse
