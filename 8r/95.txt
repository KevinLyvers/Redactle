a, nose, is, a, sensory, organ, and, respiratory, structure, in, vertebrates, it, consists, of, a, nasal, cavity, inside, the, head, and, an, external, nose, on, the, face, the, external, nose, houses, the, nostrils, or, nares, a, pair, of, tubes, providing, airflow, through, the, nose, for, respiration, where, the, nostrils, pass, through, the, nasal, cavity, they, widen, are, known, as, nasal, fossae, and, contain, turbinates, and, olfactory, mucosa, the, nasal, cavity, also, connects, to, the, paranasal, sinuses, dead, end, air, cavities, for, pressure, buffering, and, humidification, from, the, nasal, cavity, the, nostrils, continue, into, the, pharynx, a, switch, track, valve, connecting, the, respiratory, and, digestive, systems, in, humans, the, nose, is, located, centrally, on, the, face, and, serves, as, an, alternative, respiratory, passage, especially, during, suckling, for, infants, the, protruding, nose, that, is, completely, separate, from, the, mouth, part, is, a, characteristic, found, only, in, therian, mammals, it, has, been, theorized, that, this, unique, mammalian, nose, evolved, from, the, anterior, part, of, the, upper, jaw, of, the, reptilian, like, ancestors, synapsids, acting, as, the, first, interface, between, the, external, environment, and, an, animal, s, delicate, internal, lungs, a, nose, conditions, incoming, air, both, as, a, function, of, thermal, regulation, and, filtration, during, respiration, as, well, as, enabling, the, sensory, perception, of, smell, hair, inside, nostrils, filter, incoming, air, as, a, first, line, of, defense, against, dust, particles, smoke, and, other, potential, obstructions, that, would, otherwise, inhibit, respiration, and, as, a, kind, of, filter, against, airborne, illness, in, addition, to, acting, as, a, filter, mucus, produced, within, the, nose, supplements, the, body, s, effort, to, maintain, temperature, as, well, as, contributes, moisture, to, integral, components, of, the, respiratory, system, capillary, structures, of, the, nose, warm, and, humidify, air, entering, the, body, later, this, role, in, retaining, moisture, enables, conditions, for, alveoli, to, properly, exchange, o, 2, for, co, 2, i, e, respiration, within, the, lungs, during, exhalation, the, capillaries, then, aid, recovery, of, some, moisture, mostly, as, a, function, of, thermal, regulation, again, the, wet, nose, of, dogs, is, useful, for, the, perception, of, direction, the, sensitive, cold, receptors, in, the, skin, detect, the, place, where, the, nose, is, cooled, the, most, and, this, is, the, direction, a, particular, smell, that, the, animal, just, picked, up, comes, from, in, amphibians, and, lungfish, the, nostrils, open, into, small, sacs, that, in, turn, open, into, the, forward, roof, of, the, mouth, through, the, choanae, these, sacs, contain, a, small, amount, of, olfactory, epithelium, which, in, the, case, of, caecilians, also, lines, a, number, of, neighbouring, tentacles, despite, the, general, similarity, in, structure, to, those, of, amphibians, the, nostrils, of, lungfish, are, not, used, in, respiration, since, these, animals, breathe, through, their, mouths, amphibians, also, have, a, vomeronasal, organ, lined, by, olfactory, epithelium, but, unlike, those, of, amniotes, this, is, generally, a, simple, sac, that, except, in, salamanders, has, little, connection, with, the, rest, of, the, nasal, system, in, reptiles, the, nasal, chamber, is, generally, larger, with, the, choanae, located, much, further, back, in, the, roof, of, the, mouth, in, crocodilians, the, chamber, is, exceptionally, long, helping, the, animal, to, breathe, while, partially, submerged, the, reptilian, nasal, chamber, is, divided, into, three, parts, an, anterior, vestibule, the, main, olfactory, chamber, and, a, posterior, nasopharynx, the, olfactory, chamber, is, lined, by, olfactory, epithelium, on, its, upper, surface, and, possesses, a, number, of, turbinates, to, increase, the, sensory, area, the, vomeronasal, organ, is, well, developed, in, lizards, and, snakes, in, which, it, no, longer, connects, with, the, nasal, cavity, opening, directly, into, the, roof, of, the, mouth, it, is, smaller, in, turtles, in, which, it, retains, its, original, nasal, connection, and, is, absent, in, adult, crocodilians, birds, have, a, similar, nose, to, reptiles, with, the, nostrils, located, at, the, upper, rear, part, of, the, beak, since, they, generally, have, a, poor, sense, of, smell, the, olfactory, chamber, is, small, although, it, does, contain, three, turbinates, which, sometimes, have, a, complex, structure, similar, to, that, of, mammals, in, many, birds, including, doves, and, fowls, the, nostrils, are, covered, by, a, horny, protective, shield, the, vomeronasal, organ, of, birds, is, either, under, developed, or, altogether, absent, depending, on, the, species, the, nasal, cavities, in, mammals, are, both, fused, into, one, among, most, species, they, are, exceptionally, large, typically, occupying, up, to, half, the, length, of, the, skull, in, some, groups, however, including, primates, bats, and, cetaceans, the, nose, has, been, secondarily, reduced, and, these, animals, consequently, have, a, relatively, poor, sense, of, smell, the, nasal, cavity, of, mammals, has, been, enlarged, in, part, by, the, development, of, a, palate, cutting, off, the, entire, upper, surface, of, the, original, oral, cavity, which, consequently, becomes, part, of, the, nose, leaving, the, palate, as, the, new, roof, of, the, mouth, the, enlarged, nasal, cavity, contains, complex, turbinates, forming, coiled, scroll, like, shapes, that, help, to, warm, the, air, before, it, reaches, the, lungs, the, cavity, also, extends, into, neighbouring, skull, bones, forming, additional, air, cavities, known, as, paranasal, sinuses, in, cetaceans, the, nose, has, been, reduced, to, one, or, two, blowholes, which, are, the, nostrils, that, have, migrated, to, the, top, of, the, head, this, adaptation, gave, cetaceans, a, more, streamlined, body, shape, and, the, ability, to, breathe, while, mostly, submerged, conversely, the, elephant, s, nose, has, elaborated, into, a, long, muscular, manipulative, organ, called, the, trunk, the, vomeronasal, organ, of, mammals, is, generally, similar, to, that, of, reptiles, in, most, species, it, is, located, in, the, floor, of, the, nasal, cavity, and, opens, into, the, mouth, via, two, nasopalatine, ducts, running, through, the, palate, but, it, opens, directly, into, the, nose, in, many, rodents, it, is, however, lost, in, bats, and, in, many, primates, including, humans, fish, have, a, relatively, good, sense, of, smell, unlike, that, of, tetrapods, the, nose, has, no, connection, with, the, mouth, nor, any, role, in, respiration, instead, it, generally, consists, of, a, pair, of, small, pouches, located, behind, the, nostrils, at, the, front, or, sides, of, the, head, in, many, cases, each, of, the, nostrils, is, divided, into, two, by, a, fold, of, skin, allowing, water, to, flow, into, the, nose, through, one, side, and, out, through, the, other, the, pouches, are, lined, by, olfactory, epithelium, and, commonly, include, a, series, of, internal, folds, to, increase, the, surface, area, often, forming, an, elaborate, olfactory, rosette, in, some, teleosts, the, pouches, branch, off, into, additional, sinus, like, cavities, while, in, coelacanths, they, form, a, series, of, tubes, in, the, earliest, vertebrates, there, was, only, one, nostril, and, olfactory, pouch, and, the, nasal, passage, was, connected, to, the, hypophysis, the, same, anatomy, is, observed, in, the, most, primitive, living, vertebrates, the, lampreys, and, hagfish, in, gnathostome, ancestors, the, olfactory, apparatus, gradually, became, paired, presumably, to, allow, sense, of, direction, of, smells, and, freeing, the, midline, from, the, nasal, passage, allowed, evolution, of, jaws
