see, text, moa, order, dinornithiformes, are, an, extinct, group, of, flightless, birds, formerly, endemic, to, new, zealand, during, the, late, pleistocene, holocene, there, were, nine, species, in, six, genera, the, two, largest, species, dinornis, robustus, and, dinornis, novaezelandiae, reached, about, 3, 6, metres, 12, ft, in, height, with, neck, outstretched, and, weighed, about, 230, kilograms, 510, lb, while, the, smallest, the, bush, moa, anomalopteryx, didiformis, was, around, the, size, of, a, turkey, estimates, of, the, moa, population, when, polynesians, settled, new, zealand, circa, 1300, vary, between, 58, 000, and, approximately, 2, 5, million, moa, are, traditionally, placed, in, the, ratite, group, however, genetic, studies, have, found, that, their, closest, relatives, are, the, flighted, south, american, tinamous, once, considered, a, sister, group, to, ratites, the, nine, species, of, moa, were, the, only, wingless, birds, lacking, even, the, vestigial, wings, that, all, other, ratites, have, they, were, the, largest, terrestrial, animals, and, dominant, herbivores, in, new, zealand, s, forest, shrubland, and, subalpine, ecosystems, until, the, arrival, of, the, m, ori, and, were, hunted, only, by, the, haast, s, eagle, moa, extinction, occurred, within, 100, years, of, human, settlement, of, new, zealand, primarily, due, to, overhunting, the, word, moa, is, a, polynesian, term, for, domestic, fowl, the, name, was, not, in, common, use, among, the, m, ori, by, the, time, of, european, contact, likely, because, the, bird, it, described, had, been, extinct, for, some, time, and, traditional, stories, about, it, were, rare, the, earliest, record, of, the, name, was, by, missionaries, william, williams, and, william, colenso, in, january, 1838, colenso, speculated, that, the, birds, may, have, resembled, gigantic, fowl, in, 1912, m, ori, chief, urupeni, p, hara, claimed, that, the, moa, s, traditional, name, was, te, kura, the, red, bird, moa, skeletons, were, traditionally, reconstructed, in, an, upright, position, to, create, impressive, height, but, analysis, of, their, vertebral, articulations, indicates, that, they, probably, carried, their, heads, forward, in, the, manner, of, a, kiwi, the, spine, was, attached, to, the, rear, of, the, head, rather, than, the, base, indicating, the, horizontal, alignment, this, would, have, let, them, graze, on, low, vegetation, while, being, able, to, lift, their, heads, and, browse, trees, when, necessary, this, has, resulted, in, a, reconsideration, of, the, height, of, larger, moa, however, m, ori, rock, art, depicts, moa, or, moa, like, birds, likely, geese, or, adzebills, with, necks, upright, indicating, that, moa, were, more, than, capable, of, assuming, both, neck, postures, no, records, survive, of, what, sounds, moa, made, though, some, idea, of, their, calls, can, be, gained, from, fossil, evidence, the, trachea, of, moa, were, supported, by, many, small, rings, of, bone, known, as, tracheal, rings, excavation, of, these, rings, from, articulated, skeletons, has, shown, that, at, least, two, moa, genera, euryapteryx, and, emeus, exhibited, tracheal, elongation, that, is, their, trachea, were, up, to, 1, m, 3, ft, long, and, formed, a, large, loop, within, the, body, cavity, they, are, the, only, ratites, known, to, exhibit, this, feature, which, is, also, present, in, several, other, bird, groups, including, swans, cranes, and, guinea, fowl, the, feature, is, associated, with, deep, resonant, vocalisations, that, can, travel, long, distances, the, moa, s, closest, relatives, are, small, terrestrial, south, american, birds, called, the, tinamous, which, can, fly, previously, the, kiwi, the, australian, emu, and, cassowary, were, thought, to, be, most, closely, related, to, moa, although, dozens, of, species, were, described, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, many, were, based, on, partial, skeletons, and, turned, out, to, be, synonyms, currently, 11, species, are, formally, recognised, although, recent, studies, using, ancient, dna, recovered, from, bones, in, museum, collections, suggest, that, distinct, lineages, exist, within, some, of, these, one, factor, that, has, caused, much, confusion, in, moa, taxonomy, is, the, intraspecific, variation, of, bone, sizes, between, glacial, and, interglacial, periods, see, bergmann, s, rule, and, allen, s, rule, as, well, as, sexual, dimorphism, being, evident, in, several, species, dinornis, seems, to, have, had, the, most, pronounced, sexual, dimorphism, with, females, being, up, to, 150, as, tall, and, 280, as, heavy, as, males, so, much, bigger, that, they, were, classified, as, separate, species, until, 2003, a, 2009, study, showed, that, euryapteryx, curtus, and, e, gravis, were, synonyms, a, 2010, study, explained, size, differences, among, them, as, sexual, dimorphism, a, 2012, morphological, study, interpreted, them, as, subspecies, instead, analyses, of, ancient, dna, have, determined, that, a, number, of, cryptic, evolutionary, lineages, occurred, in, several, moa, genera, these, may, eventually, be, classified, as, species, or, subspecies, megalapteryx, benhami, archey, is, synonymised, with, m, didinus, owen, because, the, bones, of, both, share, all, essential, characters, size, differences, can, be, explained, by, a, north, south, cline, combined, with, temporal, variation, such, that, specimens, were, larger, during, the, otiran, glacial, period, the, last, ice, age, in, new, zealand, similar, temporal, size, variation, is, known, for, the, north, island, s, pachyornis, mappini, some, of, the, other, size, variation, for, moa, species, can, probably, be, explained, by, similar, geographic, and, temporal, factors, the, earliest, moa, remains, come, from, the, miocene, saint, bathans, fauna, known, from, multiple, eggshells, and, hind, limb, elements, these, represent, at, least, two, already, fairly, large, sized, species, the, currently, recognised, genera, and, species, are, two, unnamed, species, are, also, known, from, the, saint, bathans, fauna, because, moa, are, a, group, of, flightless, birds, with, no, vestiges, of, wing, bones, questions, have, been, raised, about, how, they, arrived, in, new, zealand, and, from, where, many, theories, exist, about, the, moa, s, arrival, and, radiation, in, new, zealand, but, the, most, recent, theory, suggests, that, they, arrived, in, new, zealand, about, 60, million, years, ago, mya, and, split, from, the, basal, see, below, moa, species, megalapteryx, about, 5, 8, mya, instead, of, the, 18, 5, mya, split, suggested, by, baker, et, al, 2005, this, does, not, necessarily, mean, there, was, no, speciation, between, the, arrival, 60, mya, and, the, basal, split, 5, 8, mya, but, the, fossil, record, is, lacking, and, most, likely, the, early, moa, lineages, existed, but, became, extinct, before, the, basal, split, 5, 8, mya, the, presence, of, miocene, aged, species, certainly, suggests, that, moa, diversification, began, before, the, split, between, megalapteryx, and, the, other, taxa, the, oligocene, drowning, maximum, event, which, occurred, about, 22, mya, when, only, 18, of, present, day, new, zealand, was, above, sea, level, is, very, important, in, the, moa, radiation, because, the, basal, moa, split, occurred, so, recently, 5, 8, mya, it, was, argued, that, ancestors, of, the, quaternary, moa, lineages, could, not, have, been, present, on, both, the, south, and, north, island, remnants, during, the, oligocene, drowning, this, does, not, imply, that, moa, were, previously, absent, from, the, north, island, but, that, only, those, from, the, south, island, survived, because, only, the, south, island, was, above, sea, level, bunce, et, al, 2009, argued, that, moa, ancestors, survived, on, the, south, island, and, then, recolonised, the, north, island, about, 2, myr, later, when, the, two, islands, rejoined, after, 30, myr, of, separation, the, presence, of, miocene, moa, in, the, saint, bathans, fauna, seems, to, suggest, that, these, birds, increased, in, size, soon, after, the, oligocene, drowning, event, if, they, were, affected, by, it, at, all, bunce, et, al, also, concluded, that, the, highly, complex, structure, of, the, moa, lineage, was, caused, by, the, formation, of, the, southern, alps, about, 6, mya, and, the, habitat, fragmentation, on, both, islands, resulting, from, pleistocene, glacial, cycles, volcanism, and, landscape, changes, the, cladogram, below, is, a, phylogeny, of, palaeognathae, generated, by, mitchell, 2014, with, some, clade, names, after, yuri, et, al, 2013, it, provides, the, position, of, the, moa, dinornithiformes, within, the, larger, context, of, the, ancient, jawed, palaeognathae, birds, struthioniformes, ostriches, rheiformes, rhea, tinamiformes, tinamous, dinornithiformes, moa, apterygiformes, kiwi, aepyornithiformes, elephant, bird, casuariidae, cassowary, dromaiidae, emu, the, cladogram, below, gives, a, more, detailed, species, level, phylogeny, of, the, moa, branch, dinornithiformes, of, the, ancient, jawed, birds, palaeognathae, shown, above, megalapteryx, didinus, d, robustus, d, novaezealandiae, p, australis, p, elephantopus, p, geranoides, anomalopteryx, didiformis, emeus, crassus, euryapteryx, curtus, analyses, of, fossil, moa, bone, assemblages, have, provided, detailed, data, on, the, habitat, preferences, of, individual, moa, species, and, revealed, distinctive, regional, moa, faunas, the, two, main, faunas, identified, in, the, south, island, include, a, subalpine, fauna, might, include, the, widespread, d, robustus, and, the, two, other, moa, species, that, existed, in, the, south, island, significantly, less, is, known, about, north, island, paleofaunas, due, to, the, scarcity, of, fossil, sites, compared, to, the, south, island, but, the, basic, pattern, of, moa, habitat, relationships, was, the, same, the, south, island, and, the, north, island, shared, some, moa, species, euryapteryx, gravis, anomalopteryx, didiformis, but, most, were, exclusive, to, one, island, reflecting, divergence, over, several, thousand, years, since, lower, sea, level, in, the, ice, age, had, made, a, land, bridge, across, the, cook, strait, in, the, north, island, dinornis, novaezealandiae, and, anomalopteryx, didiformis, dominated, in, high, rainfall, forest, habitat, a, similar, pattern, to, the, south, island, the, other, moa, species, present, in, the, north, island, euryapteryx, gravis, e, curtus, and, pachyornis, geranoides, tended, to, inhabit, drier, forest, and, shrubland, habitats, p, geranoides, occurred, throughout, the, north, island, the, distributions, of, e, gravis, and, e, curtus, were, almost, mutually, exclusive, the, former, having, only, been, found, in, coastal, sites, around, the, southern, half, of, the, north, island, about, eight, moa, trackways, with, fossilised, moa, footprint, impressions, in, fluvial, silts, have, been, found, in, the, north, island, including, waikanae, creek, 1872, napier, 1887, manawat, river, 1895, marton, 1896, palmerston, north, 1911, see, photograph, to, left, rangit, kei, river, 1939, and, under, water, in, lake, taup, 1973, analysis, of, the, spacing, of, these, tracks, indicates, walking, speeds, between, 3, and, 5, km, h, 1, 75, 3, mph, their, diet, has, been, deduced, from, fossilised, contents, of, their, gizzards, and, coprolites, as, well, as, indirectly, through, morphological, analysis, of, skull, and, beak, and, stable, isotope, analysis, of, their, bones, moa, fed, on, a, range, of, plant, species, and, plant, parts, including, fibrous, twigs, and, leaves, taken, from, low, trees, and, shrubs, the, beak, of, pachyornis, elephantopus, was, analogous, to, a, pair, of, secateurs, and, could, clip, the, fibrous, leaves, of, new, zealand, flax, phormium, tenax, and, twigs, up, to, at, least, 8, mm, in, diameter, moa, filled, the, ecological, niche, occupied, in, other, countries, by, large, browsing, mammals, such, as, antelope, and, llamas, some, biologists, contend, that, a, number, of, plant, species, evolved, to, avoid, moa, browsing, divaracating, plants, such, as, pennantia, corymbosa, the, kaik, mako, which, have, small, leaves, and, a, dense, mesh, of, branches, and, pseudopanax, crassifolius, the, horoeka, or, lancewood, which, has, tough, juvenile, leaves, are, possible, examples, of, plants, that, evolved, in, such, a, way, like, many, other, birds, moa, swallowed, gizzard, stones, gastroliths, which, were, retained, in, their, muscular, gizzards, providing, a, grinding, action, that, allowed, them, to, eat, coarse, plant, material, these, stones, were, commonly, smooth, rounded, quartz, pebbles, but, stones, over, 110, millimetres, 4, in, long, have, been, found, among, preserved, moa, gizzard, contents, dinornis, gizzards, could, often, contain, several, kilograms, of, stones, moa, likely, exercised, a, certain, selectivity, in, the, choice, of, gizzard, stones, and, chose, the, hardest, pebbles, the, pairs, of, species, of, moa, described, as, euryapteryx, curtus, e, exilis, emeus, huttonii, e, crassus, and, pachyornis, septentrionalis, p, mappini, have, long, been, suggested, to, constitute, males, and, females, respectively, this, has, been, confirmed, by, analysis, for, sex, specific, genetic, markers, of, dna, extracted, from, bone, material, for, example, before, 2003, three, species, of, dinornis, were, recognised, south, island, giant, moa, d, robustus, north, island, giant, moa, d, novaezealandiae, and, slender, moa, d, struthioides, however, dna, showed, that, all, d, struthioides, were, males, and, all, d, robustus, were, females, therefore, the, three, species, of, dinornis, were, reclassified, as, two, species, one, each, formerly, occurring, on, new, zealand, s, north, island, d, novaezealandiae, and, south, island, d, robustus, d, robustus, however, comprises, three, distinct, genetic, lineages, and, may, eventually, be, classified, as, many, species, as, discussed, above, examination, of, growth, rings, in, moa, cortical, bone, has, revealed, that, these, birds, were, k, selected, as, are, many, other, large, endemic, new, zealand, birds, they, are, characterised, by, having, a, low, fecundity, and, a, long, maturation, period, taking, about, 10, years, to, reach, adult, size, the, large, dinornis, species, took, as, long, to, reach, adult, size, as, small, moa, species, and, as, a, result, had, fast, skeletal, growth, during, their, juvenile, years, no, evidence, has, been, found, to, suggest, that, moa, were, colonial, nesters, moa, nesting, is, often, inferred, from, accumulations, of, eggshell, fragments, in, caves, and, rock, shelters, little, evidence, exists, of, the, nests, themselves, excavations, of, rock, shelters, in, the, eastern, north, island, during, the, 1940s, found, moa, nests, which, were, described, as, small, depressions, obviously, scratched, out, in, the, soft, dry, pumice, moa, nesting, material, has, also, been, recovered, from, rock, shelters, in, the, central, otago, region, of, the, south, island, where, the, dry, climate, has, preserved, plant, material, used, to, build, the, nesting, platform, including, twigs, clipped, by, moa, bills, seeds, and, pollen, within, moa, coprolites, found, among, the, nesting, material, provide, evidence, that, the, nesting, season, was, late, spring, to, summer, fragments, of, moa, eggshell, are, often, found, in, archaeological, sites, and, sand, dunes, around, the, new, zealand, coast, thirty, six, whole, moa, eggs, exist, in, museum, collections, and, vary, greatly, in, size, from, 120, 240, millimetres, 4, 7, 9, 4, in, in, length, and, 91, 178, millimetres, 3, 6, 7, 0, in, wide, the, outer, surface, of, moa, eggshell, is, characterised, by, small, slit, shaped, pores, the, eggs, of, most, moa, species, were, white, although, those, of, the, upland, moa, megalapteryx, didinus, were, blue, green, a, 2010, study, by, huynen, et, al, found, that, the, eggs, of, certain, species, were, fragile, only, around, a, millimetre, in, shell, thickness, unexpectedly, several, thin, shelled, eggs, were, also, shown, to, belong, to, the, heaviest, moa, of, the, genera, dinornis, euryapteryx, and, emeus, making, these, to, our, knowledge, the, most, fragile, of, all, avian, eggs, measured, to, date, moreover, sex, specific, dna, recovered, from, the, outer, surfaces, of, eggshells, belonging, to, species, of, dinornis, and, euryapteryx, suggest, that, these, very, thin, eggs, were, likely, to, have, been, incubated, by, the, lighter, males, the, thin, nature, of, the, eggshells, of, these, larger, species, of, moa, even, if, incubated, by, the, male, suggests, that, egg, breakage, in, these, species, would, have, been, common, if, the, typical, contact, method, of, avian, egg, incubation, was, used, despite, the, bird, s, extinction, the, high, yield, of, dna, available, from, recovered, fossilised, eggs, has, allowed, the, moa, s, genome, to, be, sequenced, studies, of, accumulated, dried, vegetation, in, the, pre, human, mid, late, holocene, period, suggests, a, low, sophora, microphylla, or, k, wai, forest, ecosystem, in, central, otago, that, was, used, and, perhaps, maintained, by, moa, for, both, nesting, material, and, food, neither, the, forests, nor, moa, existed, when, european, settlers, came, to, the, area, in, the, 1850s, before, the, arrival, of, humans, the, moa, s, only, predator, was, the, massive, haast, s, eagle, new, zealand, had, been, isolated, for, 80, million, years, and, had, few, predators, before, human, arrival, meaning, that, not, only, were, its, ecosystems, extremely, vulnerable, to, perturbation, by, outside, species, but, also, the, native, species, were, ill, equipped, to, cope, with, human, predators, polynesians, arrived, sometime, before, 1300, and, all, moa, genera, were, soon, driven, to, extinction, by, hunting, and, to, a, lesser, extent, by, habitat, reduction, due, to, forest, clearance, by, 1445, all, moa, had, become, extinct, along, with, haast, s, eagle, which, had, relied, on, them, for, food, recent, research, using, carbon, 14, dating, of, middens, strongly, suggests, that, the, events, leading, to, extinction, took, less, than, a, hundred, years, rather, than, a, period, of, exploitation, lasting, several, hundred, years, as, previously, hypothesised, an, expedition, in, the, 1850s, under, lieutenant, a, impey, reported, two, emu, like, birds, on, a, hillside, in, the, south, island, an, 1861, story, from, the, nelson, examiner, told, of, three, toed, footprints, measuring, 36, cm, 14, in, between, t, kaka, and, riwaka, that, were, found, by, a, surveying, party, and, finally, in, 1878, the, otago, witness, published, an, additional, account, from, a, farmer, and, his, shepherd, an, 80, year, old, woman, alice, mckenzie, claimed, in, 1959, that, she, had, seen, a, moa, in, fiordland, bush, in, 1887, and, again, on, a, fiordland, beach, when, she, was, 17, years, old, she, claimed, that, her, brother, had, also, seen, a, moa, on, another, occasion, in, childhood, mackenzie, saw, a, large, bird, that, she, believed, to, be, a, takah, but, after, its, rediscovery, in, the, 1940s, she, saw, a, picture, of, it, and, concluded, that, she, had, seen, something, else, some, authors, have, speculated, that, a, few, megalapteryx, didinus, may, have, persisted, in, remote, corners, of, new, zealand, until, the, 18th, and, even, 19th, centuries, but, this, view, is, not, widely, accepted, some, m, ori, hunters, claimed, to, be, in, pursuit, of, the, moa, as, late, as, the, 1770s, however, these, accounts, possibly, did, not, refer, to, the, hunting, of, actual, birds, as, much, as, a, now, lost, ritual, among, south, islanders, whalers, and, sealers, recalled, seeing, monstrous, birds, along, the, coast, of, the, south, island, and, in, the, 1820s, a, man, named, george, pauley, made, an, unverified, claim, of, seeing, a, moa, in, the, otago, region, of, new, zealand, occasional, speculation, since, at, least, the, late, 19th, century, and, as, recently, as, 2008, has, suggested, that, some, moa, may, still, exist, particularly, in, the, wilderness, of, south, westland, and, fiordland, a, 1993, report, initially, interested, the, department, of, conservation, but, the, animal, in, a, blurry, photograph, was, identified, as, a, red, deer, cryptozoologists, continue, to, search, for, them, but, their, claims, and, supporting, evidence, such, as, of, purported, footprints, have, earned, little, attention, from, experts, and, are, pseudoscientific, the, rediscovery, of, the, takah, in, 1948, after, none, had, been, seen, since, 1898, showed, that, rare, birds, can, exist, undiscovered, for, a, long, time, however, the, takah, is, a, much, smaller, bird, than, the, moa, and, was, rediscovered, after, its, tracks, were, identified, yet, no, reliable, evidence, of, moa, tracks, has, ever, been, found, and, experts, still, contend, that, moa, survival, is, extremely, unlikely, since, they, would, have, to, be, living, unnoticed, for, over, 500, years, in, a, region, visited, often, by, hunters, and, hikers, joel, polack, a, trader, who, lived, on, the, east, coast, of, the, north, island, from, 1834, to, 1837, recorded, in, 1838, that, he, had, been, shown, several, large, fossil, ossifications, found, near, mt, hikurangi, he, was, certain, that, these, were, the, bones, of, a, species, of, emu, or, ostrich, noting, that, the, natives, add, that, in, times, long, past, they, received, the, traditions, that, very, large, birds, had, existed, but, the, scarcity, of, animal, food, as, well, as, the, easy, method, of, entrapping, them, has, caused, their, extermination, polack, further, noted, that, he, had, received, reports, from, m, ori, that, a, species, of, struthio, still, existed, in, remote, parts, of, the, south, island, dieffenbach, also, refers, to, a, fossil, from, the, area, near, mt, hikurangi, and, surmises, that, it, belongs, to, a, bird, now, extinct, called, moa, or, movie, by, the, natives, movie, is, the, first, transcribed, name, for, the, bird, in, 1839, john, w, harris, a, poverty, bay, flax, trader, who, was, a, natural, history, enthusiast, was, given, a, piece, of, unusual, bone, by, a, m, ori, who, had, found, it, in, a, river, bank, he, showed, the, 15, cm, 6, in, fragment, of, bone, to, his, uncle, john, rule, a, sydney, surgeon, who, sent, it, to, richard, owen, who, at, that, time, was, working, at, the, hunterian, museum, at, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, in, london, owen, puzzled, over, the, fragment, for, almost, four, years, he, established, it, was, part, of, the, femur, of, a, big, animal, but, it, was, uncharacteristically, light, and, honeycombed, owen, announced, to, a, skeptical, scientific, community, and, the, world, that, it, was, from, a, giant, extinct, bird, like, an, ostrich, and, named, it, dinornis, his, deduction, was, ridiculed, in, some, quarters, but, was, proved, correct, with, the, subsequent, discoveries, of, considerable, quantities, of, moa, bones, throughout, the, country, sufficient, to, reconstruct, skeletons, of, the, birds, in, july, 2004, the, natural, history, museum, in, london, placed, on, display, the, moa, bone, fragment, owen, had, first, examined, to, celebrate, 200, years, since, his, birth, and, in, memory, of, owen, as, founder, of, the, museum, since, the, discovery, of, the, first, moa, bones, in, the, late, 1830s, thousands, more, have, been, found, they, occur, in, a, range, of, late, quaternary, and, holocene, sedimentary, deposits, but, are, most, common, in, three, main, types, of, site, caves, dunes, and, swamps, bones, are, commonly, found, in, caves, or, tomo, the, m, ori, word, for, doline, or, sinkhole, often, used, to, refer, to, pitfalls, or, vertical, cave, shafts, the, two, main, ways, that, the, moa, bones, were, deposited, in, such, sites, were, birds, that, entered, the, cave, to, nest, or, escape, bad, weather, and, subsequently, died, in, the, cave, and, birds, that, fell, into, a, vertical, shaft, and, were, unable, to, escape, moa, bones, and, the, bones, of, other, extinct, birds, have, been, found, in, caves, throughout, new, zealand, especially, in, the, limestone, marble, areas, of, northwest, nelson, karamea, waitomo, and, te, anau, moa, bones, and, eggshell, fragments, sometimes, occur, in, active, coastal, sand, dunes, where, they, may, erode, from, paleosols, and, concentrate, in, blowouts, between, dune, ridges, many, such, moa, bones, antedate, human, settlement, although, some, originate, from, m, ori, midden, sites, which, frequently, occur, in, dunes, near, harbours, and, river, mouths, for, example, the, large, moa, hunter, sites, at, shag, river, otago, and, wairau, bar, marlborough, densely, intermingled, moa, bones, have, been, encountered, in, swamps, throughout, new, zealand, the, most, well, known, example, is, at, pyramid, valley, in, north, canterbury, where, bones, from, at, least, 183, individual, moa, have, been, excavated, mostly, by, roger, duff, of, canterbury, museum, many, explanations, have, been, proposed, to, account, for, how, these, deposits, formed, ranging, from, poisonous, spring, waters, to, floods, and, wildfires, however, the, currently, accepted, explanation, is, that, the, bones, accumulated, slowly, over, thousands, of, years, from, birds, that, entered, the, swamps, to, feed, and, became, trapped, in, the, soft, sediment, many, new, zealand, and, international, museums, hold, moa, bone, collections, auckland, war, memorial, museum, t, maki, paenga, hira, has, a, significant, collection, and, in, 2018, several, moa, skeletons, were, imaged, and, 3d, scanned, to, make, the, collections, more, accessible, there, is, also, a, major, collection, in, otago, museum, in, dunedin, several, examples, of, moa, remains, have, been, found, with, soft, tissues, muscle, skin, feathers, preserved, through, desiccation, after, the, bird, died, at, a, dry, site, for, example, a, cave, with, a, constant, dry, breeze, blowing, through, it, most, were, found, in, the, semiarid, central, otago, region, the, driest, part, of, new, zealand, these, include, two, specimens, are, known, from, outside, the, central, otago, region, in, addition, to, these, specimens, loose, moa, feathers, have, been, collected, from, caves, and, rock, shelters, in, the, southern, south, island, and, based, on, these, remains, some, idea, of, the, moa, plumage, has, been, achieved, the, preserved, leg, of, m, didinus, from, the, old, man, range, reveals, that, this, species, was, feathered, right, down, to, the, foot, this, is, likely, to, have, been, an, adaptation, to, living, in, high, altitude, snowy, environments, and, is, also, seen, in, the, darwin, s, rhea, which, lives, in, a, similar, seasonally, snowy, habitat, moa, feathers, are, up, to, 23, cm, 9, in, long, and, a, range, of, colours, has, been, reported, including, reddish, brown, white, yellowish, and, purplish, dark, feathers, with, white, or, creamy, tips, have, also, been, found, and, indicate, that, some, moa, species, may, have, had, plumage, with, a, speckled, appearance, the, creature, has, frequently, been, mentioned, as, a, potential, candidate, for, revival, by, cloning, its, iconic, status, coupled, with, the, facts, that, it, only, became, extinct, a, few, hundred, years, ago, and, that, substantial, quantities, of, moa, remains, exist, mean, that, it, is, often, listed, alongside, such, creatures, as, the, dodo, as, leading, candidates, for, de, extinction, preliminary, work, involving, the, extraction, of, dna, has, been, undertaken, by, japanese, geneticist, ankoh, yasuyuki, shirota, interest, in, the, moa, s, potential, for, revival, was, further, stirred, in, mid, 2014, when, new, zealand, member, of, parliament, trevor, mallard, suggested, that, bringing, back, some, smaller, species, of, moa, within, 50, years, was, a, viable, idea, the, idea, was, ridiculed, by, many, but, gained, support, from, some, natural, history, experts, heinrich, harder, portrayed, moa, being, hunted, by, m, ori, in, the, classic, german, collecting, cards, about, extinct, and, prehistoric, animals, tiere, der, urwelt, in, the, early, 1900s, allen, curnow, s, poem, the, skeleton, of, the, great, moa, in, the, canterbury, museum, christchurch, was, published, in, 1943,
