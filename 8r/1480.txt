a, syndrome, is, a, set, of, medical, signs, and, symptoms, which, are, correlated, with, each, other, and, often, associated, with, a, particular, disease, or, disorder, the, word, derives, from, the, greek, meaning, concurrence, 1818, when, a, syndrome, is, paired, with, a, definite, cause, this, becomes, a, disease, in, some, instances, a, syndrome, is, so, closely, linked, with, a, pathogenesis, or, cause, that, the, words, syndrome, disease, and, disorder, end, up, being, used, interchangeably, for, them, this, substitution, of, terminology, often, confuses, the, reality, and, meaning, of, medical, diagnoses, this, is, especially, true, of, inherited, syndromes, about, one, third, of, all, phenotypes, that, are, listed, in, omim, are, described, as, dysmorphic, which, usually, refers, to, the, facial, gestalt, for, example, down, syndrome, wolf, hirschhorn, syndrome, and, andersen, tawil, syndrome, are, disorders, with, known, pathogeneses, so, each, is, more, than, just, a, set, of, signs, and, symptoms, despite, the, syndrome, nomenclature, in, other, instances, a, syndrome, is, not, specific, to, only, one, disease, for, example, toxic, shock, syndrome, can, be, caused, by, various, toxins, another, medical, syndrome, named, as, premotor, syndrome, can, be, caused, by, various, brain, lesions, and, premenstrual, syndrome, is, not, a, disease, but, simply, a, set, of, symptoms, if, an, underlying, genetic, cause, is, suspected, but, not, known, a, condition, may, be, referred, to, as, a, genetic, association, often, just, association, in, context, by, definition, an, association, indicates, that, the, collection, of, signs, and, symptoms, occurs, in, combination, more, frequently, than, would, be, likely, by, chance, alone, 167, syndromes, are, often, named, after, the, physician, or, group, of, physicians, that, discovered, them, or, initially, described, the, full, clinical, picture, such, eponymous, syndrome, names, are, examples, of, medical, eponyms, recently, there, has, been, a, shift, towards, naming, conditions, descriptively, by, symptoms, or, underlying, cause, rather, than, eponymously, but, the, eponymous, syndrome, names, often, persist, in, common, usage, the, defining, of, syndromes, has, sometimes, been, termed, syndromology, but, it, is, usually, not, a, separate, discipline, from, nosology, and, differential, diagnosis, generally, which, inherently, involve, pattern, recognition, both, sentient, and, automated, and, differentiation, among, overlapping, sets, of, signs, and, symptoms, teratology, dysmorphology, by, its, nature, involves, the, defining, of, congenital, syndromes, that, may, include, birth, defects, pathoanatomy, dysmetabolism, pathophysiology, and, neurodevelopmental, disorders, when, there, are, a, number, of, symptoms, suggesting, a, particular, disease, or, condition, but, does, not, meet, the, defined, criteria, used, to, make, a, diagnosis, of, that, disease, or, condition, this, can, be, a, bit, subjective, because, it, is, ultimately, up, to, the, clinician, to, make, the, diagnosis, this, could, be, because, it, has, not, advanced, to, the, level, or, passed, a, threshold, or, just, similar, symptoms, cause, by, other, issues, subclinical, is, synonymous, since, one, of, its, definitions, is, where, some, criteria, are, met, but, not, enough, to, achieve, clinical, status, but, subclinical, is, not, always, interchangeable, since, it, can, also, mean, not, detectable, or, producing, effects, that, are, not, detectable, by, the, usual, clinical, tests, i, e, asymptomatic, in, medicine, a, broad, definition, of, syndrome, is, used, which, describes, a, collection, of, symptoms, and, findings, without, necessarily, tying, them, to, a, single, identifiable, pathogenesis, examples, of, infectious, syndromes, include, encephalitis, and, hepatitis, which, can, both, have, several, different, infectious, causes, the, more, specific, definition, employed, in, medical, genetics, describes, a, subset, of, all, medical, syndromes, psychiatric, syndromes, often, called, psychopathological, syndromes, psychopathology, refers, both, to, psychic, dysfunctions, occurring, in, mental, disorders, and, the, study, of, the, origin, diagnosis, development, and, treatment, of, mental, disorders, in, russia, those, psychopathological, syndromes, are, used, in, modern, clinical, practice, and, described, in, psychiatric, literature, in, the, details, asthenic, syndrome, obsessive, syndrome, emotional, syndromes, for, example, manic, syndrome, depressive, syndrome, cotard, s, syndrome, catatonic, syndrome, hebephrenic, syndrome, delusional, and, hallucinatory, syndromes, for, example, paranoid, syndrome, paranoid, hallucinatory, syndrome, kandinsky, cl, rambault, s, syndrome, also, known, as, syndrome, of, psychic, automatism, hallucinosis, paraphrenic, syndrome, psychopathic, syndromes, includes, all, personality, disorders, clouding, of, consciousness, syndromes, for, example, twilight, clouding, of, consciousness, amential, syndrome, also, known, as, amentia, delirious, syndrome, stunned, consciousness, syndrome, oneiroid, syndrome, hysteric, syndrome, neurotic, syndrome, korsakoff, s, syndrome, hypochondriacal, syndrome, paranoiac, syndrome, senestopathic, syndrome, encephalopathic, syndrome, some, examples, of, psychopathological, syndromes, used, in, modern, germany, are, psychoorganic, syndrome, depressive, syndrome, paranoid, hallucinatory, syndrome, obsessive, compulsive, syndrome, autonomic, syndrome, hostility, syndrome, manic, syndrome, apathy, syndrome, m, nchausen, syndrome, ganser, syndrome, neuroleptic, induced, deficit, syndrome, olfactory, reference, syndrome, are, also, well, known, the, most, important, psychopathological, syndromes, were, classified, into, three, groups, ranked, in, order, of, severity, by, german, psychiatrist, emil, kraepelin, 1856, 1926, the, first, group, which, includes, the, mild, disorders, consists, of, five, syndromes, emotional, paranoid, hysterical, delirious, and, impulsive, the, second, intermediate, group, includes, two, syndromes, schizophrenic, syndrome, and, speech, hallucinatory, syndrome, the, third, includes, the, most, severe, disorders, and, consists, of, three, syndromes, epileptic, oligophrenic, and, dementia, in, kraepelin, s, era, epilepsy, was, viewed, as, a, mental, illness, karl, jaspers, also, considered, genuine, epilepsy, a, psychosis, and, described, the, three, major, psychoses, as, schizophrenia, epilepsy, and, manic, depressive, illness, in, the, field, of, medical, genetics, the, term, syndrome, is, traditionally, only, used, when, the, underlying, genetic, cause, is, known, thus, trisomy, 21, is, commonly, known, as, down, syndrome, until, 2005, charge, syndrome, was, most, frequently, referred, to, as, charge, association, when, the, major, causative, gene, chd7, for, the, condition, was, discovered, the, name, was, changed, the, consensus, underlying, cause, of, vacterl, association, has, not, been, determined, and, thus, it, is, not, commonly, referred, to, as, a, syndrome, in, biology, syndrome, is, used, in, a, more, general, sense, to, describe, characteristic, sets, of, features, in, various, contexts, examples, include, behavioral, syndromes, as, well, as, pollination, syndromes, and, seed, dispersal, syndromes, in, orbital, mechanics, and, astronomy, kessler, syndrome, refers, to, the, effect, where, the, density, of, objects, in, low, earth, orbit, leo, is, high, enough, that, collisions, between, objects, could, cause, a, cascade, in, which, each, collision, generates, space, debris, that, increases, the, likelihood, of, further, collisions, in, quantum, error, correction, theory, syndromes, correspond, to, errors, in, code, words, which, are, determined, with, syndrome, measurements, which, only, collapse, the, state, on, an, error, state, so, that, the, error, can, be, corrected, without, affecting, the, quantum, information, stored, in, the, code, words, there, is, no, set, common, convention, for, the, naming, of, newly, identified, syndromes, in, the, past, syndromes, were, often, named, after, the, physician, or, scientist, who, identified, and, described, the, condition, in, an, initial, publication, these, are, referred, to, as, eponymous, syndromes, in, some, cases, diseases, are, named, after, the, patient, who, initially, presents, with, symptoms, or, their, home, town, stockholm, syndrome, there, have, been, isolated, cases, of, patients, being, eager, to, have, their, syndromes, named, after, them, while, their, physicians, are, hesitant, when, a, syndrome, is, named, after, a, person, there, is, some, difference, of, opinion, as, to, whether, it, should, take, the, possessive, form, or, not, e, g, down, syndrome, vs, down, s, syndrome, north, american, usage, has, tended, to, favor, the, non, possessive, form, while, european, references, often, use, the, possessive, a, 2009, study, demonstrated, a, trend, away, from, the, possessive, form, in, europe, in, medical, literature, from, 1970, through, 2008, avicenna, in, the, canon, of, medicine, published, 1025, helped, lay, the, groundwork, for, the, idea, of, a, syndrome, and, pioneered, in, the, diagnosis, of, a, specific, disease, the, concept, of, a, medical, syndrome, was, further, developed, in, the, 17th, century, by, thomas, sydenham, even, in, syndromes, with, no, known, etiology, the, presence, of, the, associated, symptoms, with, a, statistically, improbable, correlation, normally, leads, the, researchers, to, hypothesize, that, there, exists, an, unknown, underlying, cause, for, all, the, described, symptoms, signs, and, symptoms, syndrome, disease, medical, diagnosis, differential, diagnosis, prognosis, acute, chronic, cure, eponymous, disease, acronym, or, abbreviation, remission
