see, either, species, grouped, by, sections, alphabetical, list, of, species, acer, e, s, r, ay, s, r, is, a, genus, of, trees, and, shrubs, commonly, known, as, maples, the, genus, is, placed, in, the, soapberry, family, sapindaceae, along, with, lychee, and, horse, chestnut, there, are, approximately, 132, species, most, of, which, are, native, to, asia, with, a, number, also, appearing, in, europe, northern, africa, and, north, america, only, one, species, acer, laurinum, extends, to, the, southern, hemisphere, the, type, species, of, the, genus, is, the, sycamore, maple, acer, pseudoplatanus, the, most, common, maple, species, in, europe, maples, usually, have, easily, recognizable, palmate, leaves, acer, negundo, is, an, exception, and, distinctive, winged, fruits, the, closest, relatives, of, the, maples, are, the, horse, chestnuts, maple, syrup, is, made, from, the, sap, of, some, maple, species, it, is, one, of, the, most, common, genera, of, trees, in, asia, many, maple, species, are, grown, in, gardens, where, they, are, valued, for, their, autumn, colour, the, closest, relative, of, acer, is, dipteronia, which, only, has, two, living, species, in, china, but, has, a, fossil, record, extending, back, to, the, middle, paleocene, in, north, america, the, oldest, known, fossils, of, acer, are, from, the, late, paleocene, of, northeast, asia, and, northern, north, america, around, 60, million, years, old, the, oldest, fossils, of, acer, in, europe, are, from, svalbard, dating, to, the, late, eocene, priabonian, 38, 34, million, years, ago, most, maples, are, trees, growing, to, a, height, of, 10, 45, m, 33, 148, ft, others, are, shrubs, less, than, 10, meters, tall, with, a, number, of, small, trunks, originating, at, ground, level, most, species, are, deciduous, and, many, are, renowned, for, their, autumn, leaf, colour, but, a, few, in, southern, asia, and, the, mediterranean, region, are, evergreen, most, are, shade, tolerant, when, young, and, are, often, riparian, understory, or, pioneer, species, rather, than, climax, overstory, trees, there, are, a, few, exceptions, such, as, sugar, maple, many, of, the, root, systems, are, typically, dense, and, fibrous, inhibiting, the, growth, of, other, vegetation, underneath, them, a, few, species, notably, acer, cappadocicum, frequently, produce, root, sprouts, which, can, develop, into, clonal, colonies, maples, are, distinguished, by, opposite, leaf, arrangement, the, leaves, in, most, species, are, palmate, veined, and, lobed, with, 3, to, 9, rarely, to, 13, veins, each, leading, to, a, lobe, one, of, which, is, central, or, apical, a, small, number, of, species, differ, in, having, palmate, compound, pinnate, compound, pinnate, veined, or, unlobed, leaves, several, species, including, acer, griseum, paperbark, maple, acer, mandshuricum, manchurian, maple, acer, maximowiczianum, nikko, maple, and, acer, triflorum, three, flowered, maple, have, trifoliate, leaves, one, species, acer, negundo, box, elder, or, manitoba, maple, has, pinnately, compound, leaves, that, may, be, simply, trifoliate, or, may, have, five, seven, or, rarely, nine, leaflets, a, few, such, as, acer, laevigatum, nepal, maple, and, acer, carpinifolium, hornbeam, maple, have, pinnately, veined, simple, leaves, maple, species, such, as, acer, rubrum, may, be, monoecious, dioecious, or, polygamodioecious, the, flowers, are, regular, pentamerous, and, borne, in, racemes, corymbs, or, umbels, they, have, four, or, five, sepals, four, or, five, petals, about, 1, 6, mm, long, absent, in, some, species, four, to, ten, stamens, about, 6, 10, mm, long, and, two, pistils, or, a, pistil, with, two, styles, the, ovary, is, superior, and, has, two, carpels, whose, wings, elongate, the, flowers, making, it, easy, to, tell, which, flowers, are, female, maples, flower, in, late, winter, or, early, spring, in, most, species, with, or, just, after, the, appearance, of, the, leaves, but, in, some, before, the, trees, leaf, out, maple, flowers, are, green, yellow, orange, or, red, though, individually, small, the, effect, of, an, entire, tree, in, flower, can, be, striking, in, several, species, some, maples, are, an, early, spring, source, of, pollen, and, nectar, for, bees, the, distinctive, fruits, are, called, samaras, maple, keys, helicopters, whirlybirds, or, polynoses, these, seeds, occur, in, distinctive, pairs, each, containing, one, seed, enclosed, in, a, nutlet, attached, to, a, flattened, wing, of, fibrous, papery, tissue, they, are, shaped, to, spin, as, they, fall, and, to, carry, the, seeds, a, considerable, distance, on, the, wind, people, often, call, them, helicopters, due, to, the, way, that, they, spin, as, they, fall, during, world, war, ii, the, us, army, developed, a, special, airdrop, supply, carrier, that, could, carry, up, to, 65, pounds, 29, kg, of, supplies, and, was, based, on, the, maple, seed, seed, maturation, is, usually, in, a, few, weeks, to, six, months, after, flowering, with, seed, dispersal, shortly, after, maturity, however, one, tree, can, release, hundreds, of, thousands, of, seeds, at, a, time, depending, on, the, species, the, seeds, can, be, small, and, green, to, orange, and, big, with, thicker, seed, pods, the, green, seeds, are, released, in, pairs, sometimes, with, the, stems, still, connected, the, yellow, seeds, are, released, individually, and, almost, always, without, the, stems, most, species, require, stratification, in, order, to, germinate, and, some, seeds, can, remain, dormant, in, the, soil, for, several, years, before, germinating, the, genus, acer, together, with, genus, dipteronia, are, either, classified, in, a, family, of, their, own, the, aceraceae, or, else, classified, as, members, of, the, family, sapindaceae, recent, classifications, including, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, group, system, favour, inclusion, in, sapindaceae, when, put, in, family, sapindaceae, genus, acer, is, put, in, subfamily, hippocastanoideae, the, genus, is, subdivided, by, its, morphology, into, a, multitude, of, sections, and, subsections, molecular, studies, incorporating, dna, sequence, data, from, both, chloroplast, and, nuclear, genomes, aiming, to, resolve, the, internal, relationships, and, reconstruct, the, evolutionairy, history, of, the, group, suggest, a, late, paleocene, origin, for, the, group, appearing, first, in, the, northeastern, palearctic, rapid, lineage, divergence, was, followed, by, several, independent, dispersals, to, the, nearctic, and, western, palearctic, regions, fifty, four, species, of, maples, meet, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, criteria, for, being, under, threat, of, extinction, in, their, native, habitat, the, leaves, are, used, as, a, food, plant, for, the, larvae, of, a, number, of, the, order, lepidoptera, see, list, of, lepidoptera, that, feed, on, maples, in, high, concentrations, caterpillars, like, the, greenstriped, mapleworm, dryocampa, rubicunda, can, feed, on, the, leaves, so, much, that, they, cause, temporary, defoliation, of, host, maple, trees, aphids, are, also, very, common, sap, feeders, on, maples, in, horticultural, applications, a, dimethoate, spray, will, solve, this, infestations, of, the, asian, long, horned, beetle, anoplophora, glabripennis, have, resulted, in, the, destruction, of, thousands, of, maples, and, other, tree, species, in, illinois, massachusetts, new, jersey, new, york, and, ohio, in, the, united, states, and, ontario, canada, maples, are, affected, by, a, number, of, fungal, diseases, several, are, susceptible, to, verticillium, wilt, caused, by, verticillium, species, which, can, cause, significant, local, mortality, sooty, bark, disease, caused, by, cryptostroma, species, can, kill, trees, that, are, under, stress, due, to, drought, death, of, maples, can, rarely, be, caused, by, phytophthora, root, rot, and, ganoderma, root, decay, maple, leaves, in, late, summer, and, autumn, are, commonly, disfigured, by, tar, spot, caused, by, rhytisma, species, and, mildew, caused, by, uncinula, species, though, these, diseases, do, not, usually, have, an, adverse, effect, on, the, trees, long, term, health, a, maple, leaf, is, on, the, coat, of, arms, of, canada, and, is, on, the, canadian, flag, the, maple, is, a, common, symbol, of, strength, and, endurance, and, has, been, chosen, as, the, national, tree, of, canada, maple, leaves, are, traditionally, an, important, part, of, canadian, forces, military, regalia, for, example, the, military, rank, insignia, for, generals, use, maple, leaf, symbols, there, are, 10, species, naturally, growing, in, the, country, with, at, least, one, in, each, province, although, the, idea, of, the, tree, as, a, national, symbol, originally, hailed, from, the, province, of, quebec, where, the, sugar, maple, is, significant, today, s, arboreal, emblem, of, canada, rather, refers, to, a, generic, maple, the, design, on, the, flag, is, an, eleven, point, stylization, modeled, after, a, sugar, maple, leaf, which, normally, bears, 23, points, it, is, also, in, the, name, of, the, canadian, ice, hockey, team, the, toronto, maple, leafs, the, first, attested, use, of, the, word, was, in, 1260, as, mapole, and, it, also, appears, a, century, later, in, geoffrey, chaucer, s, canterbury, tales, spelled, as, mapul, the, maple, is, also, a, symbol, of, hiroshima, ubiquitous, in, the, local, meibutsu, the, maple, leaf, appears, in, the, coat, of, arms, of, sammatti, a, former, municipality, of, uusimaa, finland, some, species, of, maple, are, extensively, planted, as, ornamental, trees, by, homeowners, businesses, and, municipalities, due, to, their, fall, colour, relatively, fast, growth, ease, of, transplanting, and, lack, of, hard, seeds, that, would, pose, a, problem, for, mowing, lawns, particularly, popular, are, norway, maple, although, it, is, considered, invasive, in, north, america, silver, maple, japanese, maple, and, red, maple, the, vine, maple, is, also, occasionally, used, as, an, ornamental, tree, other, maples, especially, smaller, or, more, unusual, species, are, popular, as, specimen, trees, numerous, maple, cultivars, that, have, been, selected, for, particular, characteristics, can, be, propagated, only, by, asexual, reproduction, such, as, cuttings, tissue, culture, budding, or, grafting, acer, palmatum, japanese, maple, alone, has, over, 1, 000, cultivars, most, selected, in, japan, and, many, of, them, no, longer, propagated, or, not, in, cultivation, in, the, western, world, some, delicate, cultivars, are, usually, grown, in, pots, and, rarely, reach, heights, of, more, than, 50, 100, cm, maples, are, a, popular, choice, for, the, art, of, bonsai, japanese, maple, acer, palmatum, trident, maple, a, buergerianum, amur, maple, a, ginnala, field, maple, a, campestre, and, montpellier, maple, a, monspessulanum, are, popular, choices, and, respond, well, to, techniques, that, encourage, leaf, reduction, and, ramification, but, most, species, can, be, used, maple, collections, sometimes, called, aceretums, occupy, space, in, many, gardens, and, arboreta, around, the, world, including, the, five, great, w, s, in, england, wakehurst, place, garden, westonbirt, arboretum, windsor, great, park, winkworth, arboretum, and, wisley, garden, in, the, united, states, the, aceretum, at, the, harvard, owned, arnold, arboretum, in, boston, is, especially, notable, in, the, number, of, species, and, cultivars, the, esveld, aceretum, in, boskoop, netherlands, is, the, largest, in, the, world, maples, are, important, as, sources, of, syrup, and, wood, dried, wood, is, often, used, for, the, smoking, of, food, charcoal, from, maples, is, an, integral, part, of, the, lincoln, county, process, used, to, make, tennessee, whiskey, they, are, also, cultivated, as, ornamental, plants, and, have, benefits, for, tourism, and, agriculture, some, of, the, larger, maple, species, have, valuable, timber, particularly, sugar, maple, in, north, america, and, sycamore, maple, in, europe, sugar, maple, wood, often, known, as, hard, maple, is, the, wood, of, choice, for, bowling, pins, bowling, alley, lanes, pool, and, snooker, cue, shafts, and, butcher, s, blocks, maple, wood, is, also, used, for, the, manufacture, of, wooden, baseball, bats, though, less, often, than, ash, or, hickory, due, to, the, tendency, of, maple, bats, to, shatter, if, they, do, break, the, maple, bat, was, introduced, to, major, league, baseball, mlb, in, 1998, by, sam, bat, founder, sam, holman, today, it, is, the, standard, maple, bat, most, in, use, by, professional, baseball, maple, is, also, commonly, used, in, archery, as, the, core, material, in, the, limbs, of, a, recurve, bow, due, to, its, stiffness, and, strength, maple, wood, is, often, graded, based, on, physical, and, aesthetic, characteristics, the, most, common, terminology, includes, the, grading, scale, from, common, 2, which, is, unselected, and, often, used, for, craft, woods, common, 1, used, for, commercial, and, residential, buildings, clear, and, select, grade, which, is, sought, for, fine, woodworking, some, maple, wood, has, a, highly, decorative, wood, grain, known, as, flame, maple, quilt, maple, birdseye, maple, and, burl, wood, this, condition, occurs, randomly, in, individual, trees, of, several, species, and, often, cannot, be, detected, until, the, wood, has, been, sawn, though, it, is, sometimes, visible, in, the, standing, tree, as, a, rippled, pattern, in, the, bark, these, select, decorative, wood, pieces, also, have, subcategories, that, further, filter, the, aesthetic, looks, crotch, wood, bees, wing, cats, paw, old, growth, and, mottled, are, some, terms, used, to, describe, the, look, of, these, decorative, woods, maples, have, a, long, history, of, use, for, furniture, production, in, the, united, states, the, cherokee, people, would, produce, a, purple, dye, from, maple, bark, which, they, used, to, dye, cloth, maple, is, considered, a, tonewood, or, a, wood, that, carries, sound, waves, well, and, is, used, in, numerous, musical, instruments, maple, is, harder, and, has, a, brighter, sound, than, mahogany, which, is, another, major, tonewood, used, in, instrument, manufacturing, the, back, sides, and, neck, of, most, violins, violas, cellos, and, double, basses, are, made, from, maple, electric, guitar, necks, are, commonly, made, from, maple, having, good, dimensional, stability, the, necks, of, the, fender, stratocaster, and, telecaster, were, originally, an, entirely, maple, one, piece, neck, but, later, were, also, available, with, rosewood, fingerboards, les, paul, desired, an, all, maple, guitar, but, due, to, the, weight, of, maple, only, the, tops, of, gibson, s, les, paul, guitars, are, made, from, carved, maple, often, using, quilted, or, flamed, maple, tops, due, to, its, weight, very, few, solid, body, guitars, are, made, entirely, from, maple, but, many, guitars, have, maple, necks, tops, or, veneers, maple, is, also, often, used, to, make, bassoons, and, sometimes, for, other, woodwind, instruments, like, maple, recorders, many, drums, are, made, from, maple, from, the, 1970s, to, the, 1990s, maple, drum, kits, were, a, vast, majority, of, all, drum, kits, made, but, in, recent, years, birch, has, become, popular, for, drums, once, again, some, of, the, best, drum, building, companies, use, maple, extensively, throughout, their, mid, pro, range, maple, drums, are, favored, for, their, bright, resonant, sound, certain, types, of, drum, sticks, are, also, made, from, maple, during, late, winter, to, early, spring, in, northeastern, north, america, when, the, night, to, day, temperatures, change, from, freezing, to, thawing, maple, trees, may, be, tapped, for, sap, to, manufacture, maple, syrup, the, sap, is, sent, via, tubing, to, a, sugar, house, where, it, is, boiled, to, produce, syrup, or, made, into, maple, sugar, or, maple, taffy, it, takes, about, 40, litres, 42, us, qt, of, sugar, maple, sap, to, make, 1, litre, 1, 1, us, qt, of, syrup, while, any, acer, species, may, be, tapped, for, syrup, many, do, not, have, sufficient, quantities, of, sugar, to, be, commercially, useful, whereas, sugar, maples, a, saccharum, are, most, commonly, used, to, produce, maple, syrup, qu, bec, canada, is, a, major, producer, of, maple, syrup, an, industry, worth, about, 500, million, canadian, dollars, annually, also, as, these, trees, are, a, major, source, of, pollen, in, early, spring, before, many, other, plants, have, flowered, maple, flowers, are, a, source, of, foraging, for, honeybees, that, play, a, commercially, important, role, in, general, agriculture, and, in, natural, habitats, maple, is, used, as, pulpwood, the, fibers, have, relatively, thick, walls, that, prevent, collapsing, upon, drying, this, gives, good, bulk, and, opacity, in, paper, maple, also, gives, paper, good, printing, properties, many, maples, have, bright, autumn, foliage, and, many, countries, have, leaf, watching, traditions, the, sugar, maple, acer, saccharum, is, the, primary, contributor, to, fall, foliage, season, in, north, eastern, north, america, in, japan, the, custom, of, viewing, the, changing, colour, of, maples, in, the, autumn, is, called, momijigari, nikk, and, kyoto, are, particularly, favoured, destinations, for, this, activity, in, korea, the, same, viewing, activity, is, called, danpung, nori, and, the, seoraksan, and, naejang, san, mountains, are, among, the, best, known, destinations
