schizophrenia, is, a, mental, disorder, characterized, by, hallucinations, typically, hearing, voices, delusions, disorganized, thinking, and, behavior, and, flat, or, inappropriate, affect, symptoms, develop, gradually, and, typically, begin, during, young, adulthood, and, are, never, resolved, there, is, no, objective, diagnostic, test, diagnosis, is, based, on, observed, behavior, a, psychiatric, history, that, includes, the, person, s, reported, experiences, and, reports, of, others, familiar, with, the, person, for, a, diagnosis, of, schizophrenia, the, described, symptoms, need, to, have, been, present, for, at, least, six, months, according, to, the, dsm, 5, or, one, month, according, to, the, icd, 11, many, people, with, schizophrenia, have, other, mental, disorders, especially, depressive, disorder, anxiety, disorders, and, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, about, 0, 3, to, 0, 7, of, people, are, diagnosed, with, schizophrenia, during, their, lifetime, in, 2017, there, were, an, estimated, 1, 1, million, new, cases, and, in, 2022, a, total, of, 24, million, cases, globally, males, are, more, often, affected, and, on, average, have, an, earlier, onset, than, females, the, causes, of, schizophrenia, may, include, genetic, and, environmental, factors, genetic, factors, include, a, variety, of, common, and, rare, genetic, variants, possible, environmental, factors, include, being, raised, in, a, city, childhood, adversity, cannabis, use, during, adolescence, infections, the, age, of, a, person, s, mother, or, father, and, poor, nutrition, during, pregnancy, about, half, of, those, diagnosed, with, schizophrenia, will, have, a, significant, improvement, over, the, long, term, with, no, further, relapses, and, a, small, proportion, of, these, will, recover, completely, the, other, half, will, have, a, lifelong, impairment, in, severe, cases, people, may, be, admitted, to, hospitals, social, problems, such, as, long, term, unemployment, poverty, homelessness, exploitation, and, victimization, are, commonly, correlated, with, schizophrenia, compared, to, the, general, population, people, with, schizophrenia, have, a, higher, suicide, rate, about, 5, overall, and, more, physical, health, problems, leading, to, an, average, decrease, in, life, expectancy, by, 20, to, 28, years, in, 2015, an, estimated, 17, 000, deaths, were, linked, to, schizophrenia, the, mainstay, of, treatment, is, antipsychotic, medication, including, olanzapine, and, risperidone, along, with, counseling, job, training, and, social, rehabilitation, up, to, a, third, of, people, do, not, respond, to, initial, antipsychotics, in, which, case, clozapine, gained, approval, by, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, for, treatment, resistant, cases, in, a, network, comparative, meta, analysis, of, 15, antipsychotic, drugs, clozapine, was, significantly, more, effective, than, all, other, drugs, although, clozapine, s, heavily, multimodal, action, may, cause, more, significant, side, effects, in, situations, where, doctors, judge, that, there, is, a, risk, of, harm, to, self, or, others, they, may, impose, short, involuntary, hospitalization, long, term, hospitalization, is, used, on, a, small, number, of, people, with, severe, schizophrenia, in, some, countries, where, supportive, services, are, limited, or, unavailable, long, term, hospital, stays, are, more, common, schizophrenia, is, a, mental, disorder, characterized, by, significant, alterations, in, perception, thoughts, mood, and, behavior, symptoms, are, described, in, terms, of, positive, negative, and, cognitive, symptoms, the, positive, symptoms, of, schizophrenia, are, the, same, for, any, psychosis, and, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, psychotic, symptoms, these, may, be, present, in, any, of, the, different, psychoses, and, are, often, transient, making, early, diagnosis, of, schizophrenia, problematic, psychosis, noted, for, the, first, time, in, a, person, who, is, later, diagnosed, with, schizophrenia, is, referred, to, as, a, first, episode, psychosis, fep, positive, symptoms, are, those, symptoms, that, are, not, normally, experienced, but, are, present, in, people, during, a, psychotic, episode, in, schizophrenia, including, delusions, hallucinations, and, disorganized, thoughts, speech, and, behavior, or, inappropriate, affect, typically, regarded, as, manifestations, of, psychosis, hallucinations, occur, at, some, point, in, the, lifetimes, of, 80, of, those, with, schizophrenia, and, most, commonly, involve, the, sense, of, hearing, most, often, hearing, voices, but, can, sometimes, involve, any, of, the, other, senses, of, taste, sight, smell, and, touch, the, frequency, of, hallucinations, involving, multiple, senses, is, double, the, rate, of, those, involving, only, one, sense, they, are, also, typically, related, to, the, content, of, the, delusional, theme, delusions, are, bizarre, or, persecutory, in, nature, distortions, of, self, experience, such, as, feeling, that, others, can, hear, one, s, thoughts, or, that, thoughts, are, being, inserted, into, one, s, mind, sometimes, termed, passivity, phenomena, are, also, common, positive, symptoms, generally, respond, well, to, medication, and, become, reduced, over, the, course, of, the, illness, perhaps, linked, to, the, age, related, decline, in, dopamine, activity, negative, symptoms, are, deficits, of, normal, emotional, responses, or, of, other, thought, processes, the, five, recognized, domains, of, negative, symptoms, are, blunted, affect, showing, flat, expressions, monotone, or, little, emotion, alogia, a, poverty, of, speech, anhedonia, an, inability, to, feel, pleasure, asociality, the, lack, of, desire, to, form, relationships, and, avolition, a, lack, of, motivation, and, apathy, avolition, and, anhedonia, are, seen, as, motivational, deficits, resulting, from, impaired, reward, processing, reward, is, the, main, driver, of, motivation, and, this, is, mostly, mediated, by, dopamine, it, has, been, suggested, that, negative, symptoms, are, multidimensional, and, they, have, been, categorised, into, two, subdomains, of, apathy, or, lack, of, motivation, and, diminished, expression, apathy, includes, avolition, anhedonia, and, social, withdrawal, diminished, expression, includes, blunt, affect, and, alogia, sometimes, diminished, expression, is, treated, as, both, verbal, and, non, verbal, apathy, accounts, for, around, 50, percent, of, the, most, often, found, negative, symptoms, and, affects, functional, outcome, and, subsequent, quality, of, life, apathy, is, related, to, disrupted, cognitive, processing, affecting, memory, and, planning, including, goal, directed, behaviour, the, two, subdomains, have, suggested, a, need, for, separate, treatment, approaches, a, lack, of, distress, is, another, noted, negative, symptom, a, distinction, is, often, made, between, those, negative, symptoms, that, are, inherent, to, schizophrenia, termed, primary, and, those, that, result, from, positive, symptoms, from, the, side, effects, of, antipsychotics, substance, use, disorder, and, social, deprivation, termed, secondary, negative, symptoms, negative, symptoms, are, less, responsive, to, medication, and, the, most, difficult, to, treat, however, if, properly, assessed, secondary, negative, symptoms, are, amenable, to, treatment, scales, for, specifically, assessing, the, presence, of, negative, symptoms, and, for, measuring, their, severity, and, their, changes, have, been, introduced, since, the, earlier, scales, such, as, the, panns, that, deals, with, all, types, of, symptoms, these, scales, are, the, clinical, assessment, interview, for, negative, symptoms, cains, and, the, brief, negative, symptom, scale, bnss, also, known, as, second, generation, scales, in, 2020, ten, years, after, its, introduction, a, cross, cultural, study, of, the, use, of, bnss, found, valid, and, reliable, psychometric, evidence, for, its, five, domain, structure, cross, culturally, the, bnss, can, assess, both, the, presence, and, severity, of, negative, symptoms, of, the, five, recognized, domains, and, an, additional, item, of, reduced, normal, distress, it, has, been, used, to, measure, changes, in, negative, symptoms, in, trials, of, psychosocial, and, pharmacological, interventions, an, estimated, 70, of, those, with, schizophrenia, have, cognitive, deficits, and, these, are, most, pronounced, in, early, onset, and, late, onset, illness, these, are, often, evident, long, before, the, onset, of, illness, in, the, prodromal, stage, and, may, be, present, in, childhood, or, early, adolescence, they, are, a, core, feature, but, not, considered, to, be, core, symptoms, as, are, positive, and, negative, symptoms, however, their, presence, and, degree, of, dysfunction, is, taken, as, a, better, indicator, of, functionality, than, the, presentation, of, core, symptoms, cognitive, deficits, become, worse, at, first, episode, psychosis, but, then, return, to, baseline, and, remain, fairly, stable, over, the, course, of, the, illness, the, deficits, in, cognition, are, seen, to, drive, the, negative, psychosocial, outcome, in, schizophrenia, and, are, claimed, to, equate, to, a, possible, reduction, in, iq, from, the, norm, of, 100, to, 70, 85, cognitive, deficits, may, be, of, neurocognition, nonsocial, or, of, social, cognition, neurocognition, is, the, ability, to, receive, and, remember, information, and, includes, verbal, fluency, memory, reasoning, problem, solving, speed, of, processing, and, auditory, and, visual, perception, verbal, memory, and, attention, are, seen, to, be, the, most, affected, verbal, memory, impairment, is, associated, with, a, decreased, level, of, semantic, processing, relating, meaning, to, words, another, memory, impairment, is, that, of, episodic, memory, an, impairment, in, visual, perception, that, is, consistently, found, in, schizophrenia, is, that, of, visual, backward, masking, visual, processing, impairments, include, an, inability, to, perceive, complex, visual, illusions, social, cognition, is, concerned, with, the, mental, operations, needed, to, interpret, and, understand, the, self, and, others, in, the, social, world, this, is, also, an, associated, impairment, and, facial, emotion, perception, is, often, found, to, be, difficult, facial, perception, is, critical, for, ordinary, social, interaction, cognitive, impairments, do, not, usually, respond, to, antipsychotics, and, there, are, a, number, of, interventions, that, are, used, to, try, to, improve, them, cognitive, remediation, therapy, is, of, particular, help, neurological, soft, signs, of, clumsiness, and, loss, of, fine, motor, movement, are, often, found, in, schizophrenia, which, may, resolve, with, effective, treatment, of, fep, onset, typically, occurs, between, the, late, teens, and, early, 30s, with, the, peak, incidence, occurring, in, males, in, the, early, to, mid, twenties, and, in, females, in, the, late, twenties, onset, before, the, age, of, 17, is, known, as, early, onset, and, before, the, age, of, 13, as, can, sometimes, occur, is, known, as, childhood, schizophrenia, or, very, early, onset, onset, can, occur, between, the, ages, of, 40, and, 60, known, as, late, onset, schizophrenia, onset, over, the, age, of, 60, which, may, be, difficult, to, differentiate, as, schizophrenia, is, known, as, very, late, onset, schizophrenia, like, psychosis, late, onset, has, shown, that, a, higher, rate, of, females, are, affected, they, have, less, severe, symptoms, and, need, lower, doses, of, antipsychotics, the, tendency, for, earlier, onset, in, males, is, later, seen, to, be, balanced, by, a, post, menopausal, increase, in, the, development, in, females, estrogen, produced, pre, menopause, has, a, dampening, effect, on, dopamine, receptors, but, its, protection, can, be, overridden, by, a, genetic, overload, there, has, been, a, dramatic, increase, in, the, numbers, of, older, adults, with, schizophrenia, onset, may, happen, suddenly, or, may, occur, after, the, slow, and, gradual, development, of, a, number, of, signs, and, symptoms, a, period, known, as, the, prodromal, stage, up, to, 75, of, those, with, schizophrenia, go, through, a, prodromal, stage, the, negative, and, cognitive, symptoms, in, the, prodrome, stage, can, precede, fep, first, episode, psychosis, by, many, months, and, up, to, five, years, the, period, from, fep, and, treatment, is, known, as, the, duration, of, untreated, psychosis, dup, which, is, seen, to, be, a, factor, in, functional, outcome, the, prodromal, stage, is, the, high, risk, stage, for, the, development, of, psychosis, since, the, progression, to, first, episode, psychosis, is, not, inevitable, an, alternative, term, is, often, preferred, of, at, risk, mental, state, cognitive, dysfunction, at, an, early, age, impacts, a, young, person, s, usual, cognitive, development, recognition, and, early, intervention, at, the, prodromal, stage, would, minimize, the, associated, disruption, to, educational, and, social, development, and, has, been, the, focus, of, many, studies, schizophrenia, is, described, as, a, neurodevelopmental, disorder, with, no, precise, boundary, or, single, cause, and, is, thought, to, develop, from, gene, environment, interactions, with, involved, vulnerability, factors, the, interactions, of, these, risk, factors, are, complex, as, numerous, and, diverse, insults, from, conception, to, adulthood, can, be, involved, a, genetic, predisposition, on, its, own, without, interacting, environmental, factors, will, not, give, rise, to, the, development, of, schizophrenia, the, genetic, component, means, that, prenatal, brain, development, is, disturbed, and, environmental, influence, affects, the, postnatal, development, of, the, brain, evidence, suggests, that, genetically, susceptible, children, are, more, likely, to, be, vulnerable, to, the, effects, of, environmental, risk, factors, estimates, of, the, heritability, of, schizophrenia, are, between, 70, and, 80, which, implies, that, 70, to, 80, of, the, individual, differences, in, risk, of, schizophrenia, are, associated, with, genetics, these, estimates, vary, because, of, the, difficulty, in, separating, genetic, and, environmental, influences, and, their, accuracy, has, been, queried, the, greatest, risk, factor, for, developing, schizophrenia, is, having, a, first, degree, relative, with, the, disease, risk, is, 6, 5, more, than, 40, of, identical, twins, of, those, with, schizophrenia, are, also, affected, if, one, parent, is, affected, the, risk, is, about, 13, and, if, both, are, affected, the, risk, is, nearly, 50, however, the, dsm, 5, indicates, that, most, people, with, schizophrenia, have, no, family, history, of, psychosis, results, of, candidate, gene, studies, of, schizophrenia, have, generally, failed, to, find, consistent, associations, and, the, genetic, loci, identified, by, genome, wide, association, studies, explain, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, variation, in, the, disease, many, genes, are, known, to, be, involved, in, schizophrenia, each, with, small, effects, and, unknown, transmission, and, expression, the, summation, of, these, effect, sizes, into, a, polygenic, risk, score, can, explain, at, least, 7, of, the, variability, in, liability, for, schizophrenia, around, 5, of, cases, of, schizophrenia, are, understood, to, be, at, least, partially, attributable, to, rare, copy, number, variations, cnvs, these, structural, variations, are, associated, with, known, genomic, disorders, involving, deletions, at, 22q11, 2, digeorge, syndrome, and, 17q12, 17q12, microdeletion, syndrome, duplications, at, 16p11, 2, most, frequently, found, and, deletions, at, 15q11, 2, burnside, butler, syndrome, some, of, these, cnvs, increase, the, risk, of, developing, schizophrenia, by, as, much, as, 20, fold, and, are, frequently, comorbid, with, autism, and, intellectual, disabilities, the, genes, crhr1, and, crhbp, are, associated, with, the, severity, of, suicidal, behavior, these, genes, code, for, stress, response, proteins, needed, in, the, control, of, the, hpa, axis, and, their, interaction, can, affect, this, axis, response, to, stress, can, cause, lasting, changes, in, the, function, of, the, hpa, axis, possibly, disrupting, the, negative, feedback, mechanism, homeostasis, and, the, regulation, of, emotion, leading, to, altered, behaviors, the, question, of, how, schizophrenia, could, be, primarily, genetically, influenced, given, that, people, with, schizophrenia, have, lower, fertility, rates, is, a, paradox, it, is, expected, that, genetic, variants, that, increase, the, risk, of, schizophrenia, would, be, selected, against, due, to, their, negative, effects, on, reproductive, fitness, a, number, of, potential, explanations, have, been, proposed, including, that, alleles, associated, with, schizophrenia, risk, confers, a, fitness, advantage, in, unaffected, individuals, while, some, evidence, has, not, supported, this, idea, others, propose, that, a, large, number, of, alleles, each, contributing, a, small, amount, can, persist, a, meta, analysis, found, that, oxidative, dna, damage, was, significantly, increased, in, schizophrenia, environmental, factors, each, associated, with, a, slight, risk, of, developing, schizophrenia, in, later, life, include, oxygen, deprivation, infection, prenatal, maternal, stress, and, malnutrition, in, the, mother, during, prenatal, development, a, risk, is, associated, with, maternal, obesity, in, increasing, oxidative, stress, and, dysregulating, the, dopamine, and, serotonin, pathways, both, maternal, stress, and, infection, have, been, demonstrated, to, alter, fetal, neurodevelopment, through, an, increase, of, pro, inflammatory, cytokines, there, is, a, slighter, risk, associated, with, being, born, in, the, winter, or, spring, possibly, due, to, vitamin, d, deficiency, or, a, prenatal, viral, infection, other, infections, during, pregnancy, or, around, the, time, of, birth, that, have, been, linked, to, an, increased, risk, include, infections, by, toxoplasma, gondii, and, chlamydia, the, increased, risk, is, about, five, to, eight, percent, viral, infections, of, the, brain, during, childhood, are, also, linked, to, a, risk, of, schizophrenia, during, adulthood, cat, exposure, is, also, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, broadly, defined, schizophrenia, related, disorders, with, an, odds, ratio, of, 2, 4, adverse, childhood, experiences, aces, severe, forms, of, which, are, classed, as, childhood, trauma, range, from, being, bullied, or, abused, to, the, death, of, a, parent, many, adverse, childhood, experiences, can, cause, toxic, stress, and, increase, the, risk, of, psychosis, chronic, trauma, including, aces, can, promote, lasting, inflammatory, dysregulation, throughout, the, nervous, system, it, is, suggested, that, early, stress, may, contribute, to, the, development, of, schizophrenia, through, these, alterations, in, the, immune, system, schizophrenia, was, the, last, diagnosis, to, benefit, from, the, link, made, between, aces, and, adult, mental, health, outcomes, living, in, an, urban, environment, during, childhood, or, as, an, adult, has, consistently, been, found, to, increase, the, risk, of, schizophrenia, by, a, factor, of, two, even, after, taking, into, account, drug, use, ethnic, group, and, size, of, social, group, a, possible, link, between, the, urban, environment, and, pollution, has, been, suggested, to, be, the, cause, of, the, elevated, risk, of, schizophrenia, other, risk, factors, include, social, isolation, immigration, related, to, social, adversity, and, racial, discrimination, family, dysfunction, unemployment, and, poor, housing, conditions, having, a, father, older, than, 40, years, or, parents, younger, than, 20, years, are, also, associated, with, schizophrenia, about, half, of, those, with, schizophrenia, use, recreational, drugs, including, alcohol, tobacco, and, cannabis, excessively, use, of, stimulants, such, as, amphetamine, and, cocaine, can, lead, to, a, temporary, stimulant, psychosis, which, presents, very, similarly, to, schizophrenia, rarely, alcohol, use, can, also, result, in, a, similar, alcohol, related, psychosis, drugs, may, also, be, used, as, coping, mechanisms, by, people, who, have, schizophrenia, to, deal, with, depression, anxiety, boredom, and, loneliness, the, use, of, cannabis, and, tobacco, are, not, associated, with, the, development, of, cognitive, deficits, and, sometimes, a, reverse, relationship, is, found, where, their, use, improves, these, symptoms, however, substance, use, disorders, are, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, suicide, and, a, poor, response, to, treatment, cannabis, use, may, be, a, contributory, factor, in, the, development, of, schizophrenia, potentially, increasing, the, risk, of, the, disease, in, those, who, are, already, at, risk, the, increased, risk, may, require, the, presence, of, certain, genes, within, an, individual, its, use, is, associated, with, doubling, the, rate, the, causes, of, schizophrenia, are, unknown, and, a, number, of, models, have, been, put, forward, to, explain, the, link, between, altered, brain, function, and, schizophrenia, the, prevailing, model, of, schizophrenia, is, that, of, a, neurodevelopmental, disorder, and, the, underlying, changes, that, occur, before, symptoms, become, evident, are, seen, as, arising, from, the, interaction, between, genes, and, the, environment, extensive, studies, support, this, model, maternal, infections, malnutrition, and, complications, during, pregnancy, and, childbirth, are, known, risk, factors, for, the, development, of, schizophrenia, which, usually, emerges, between, the, ages, of, 18, and, 25, a, period, that, overlaps, with, certain, stages, of, neurodevelopment, gene, environment, interactions, lead, to, deficits, in, the, neural, circuitry, that, affect, sensory, and, cognitive, functions, the, common, dopamine, and, glutamate, models, proposed, are, not, mutually, exclusive, each, is, seen, to, have, a, role, in, the, neurobiology, of, schizophrenia, the, most, common, model, put, forward, was, the, dopamine, hypothesis, of, schizophrenia, which, attributes, psychosis, to, the, mind, s, faulty, interpretation, of, the, misfiring, of, dopaminergic, neurons, this, has, been, directly, related, to, the, symptoms, of, delusions, and, hallucinations, abnormal, dopamine, signaling, has, been, implicated, in, schizophrenia, based, on, the, usefulness, of, medications, that, affect, the, dopamine, receptor, and, the, observation, that, dopamine, levels, are, increased, during, acute, psychosis, a, decrease, in, d, 1, receptors, in, the, dorsolateral, prefrontal, cortex, may, also, be, responsible, for, deficits, in, working, memory, the, glutamate, hypothesis, of, schizophrenia, links, alterations, between, glutamatergic, neurotransmission, and, the, neural, oscillations, that, affect, connections, between, the, thalamus, and, the, cortex, studies, have, shown, that, a, reduced, expression, of, a, glutamate, receptor, nmda, receptor, and, glutamate, blocking, drugs, such, as, phencyclidine, and, ketamine, can, mimic, the, symptoms, and, cognitive, problems, associated, with, schizophrenia, post, mortem, studies, consistently, find, that, a, subset, of, these, neurons, fail, to, express, gad67, gad1, in, addition, to, abnormalities, in, brain, morphometry, the, subsets, of, interneurons, that, are, abnormal, in, schizophrenia, are, responsible, for, the, synchronizing, of, neural, ensembles, needed, during, working, memory, tasks, these, give, the, neural, oscillations, produced, as, gamma, waves, that, have, a, frequency, of, between, 30, and, 80, hertz, both, working, memory, tasks, and, gamma, waves, are, impaired, in, schizophrenia, which, may, reflect, abnormal, interneuron, functionality, an, important, process, that, may, be, disrupted, in, neurodevelopment, is, astrogenesis, the, formation, of, astrocytes, astrocytes, are, crucial, in, contributing, to, the, formation, and, maintenance, of, neural, circuits, and, it, is, believed, that, disruption, in, this, role, can, result, in, a, number, of, neurodevelopmental, disorders, including, schizophrenia, evidence, suggests, that, reduced, numbers, of, astrocytes, in, deeper, cortical, layers, are, assocociated, with, a, diminished, expression, of, eaat2, a, glutamate, transporter, in, astrocytes, supporting, the, glutamate, hypothesis, deficits, in, executive, functions, such, as, planning, inhibition, and, working, memory, are, pervasive, in, schizophrenia, although, these, functions, are, separable, their, dysfunction, in, schizophrenia, may, reflect, an, underlying, deficit, in, the, ability, to, represent, goal, related, information, in, working, memory, and, to, use, this, to, direct, cognition, and, behavior, these, impairments, have, been, linked, to, a, number, of, neuroimaging, and, neuropathological, abnormalities, for, example, functional, neuroimaging, studies, report, evidence, of, reduced, neural, processing, efficiency, whereby, the, dorsolateral, prefrontal, cortex, is, activated, to, a, greater, degree, to, achieve, a, certain, level, of, performance, relative, to, controls, on, working, memory, tasks, these, abnormalities, may, be, linked, to, the, consistent, post, mortem, finding, of, reduced, neuropil, evidenced, by, increased, pyramidal, cell, density, and, reduced, dendritic, spine, density, these, cellular, and, functional, abnormalities, may, also, be, reflected, in, structural, neuroimaging, studies, that, find, reduced, grey, matter, volume, in, association, with, deficits, in, working, memory, tasks, positive, symptoms, have, been, linked, to, cortical, thinning, in, the, superior, temporal, gyrus, the, severity, of, negative, symptoms, has, been, linked, to, reduced, thickness, in, the, left, medial, orbitofrontal, cortex, anhedonia, traditionally, defined, as, a, reduced, capacity, to, experience, pleasure, is, frequently, reported, in, schizophrenia, however, a, large, body, of, evidence, suggests, that, hedonic, responses, are, intact, in, schizophrenia, and, that, what, is, reported, to, be, anhedonia, is, a, reflection, of, dysfunction, in, other, processes, related, to, reward, overall, a, failure, of, reward, prediction, is, thought, to, lead, to, impairment, in, the, generation, of, cognition, and, behavior, required, to, obtain, rewards, despite, normal, hedonic, responses, another, theory, links, abnormal, brain, lateralization, to, the, development, of, being, left, handed, which, is, significantly, more, common, in, those, with, schizophrenia, this, abnormal, development, of, hemispheric, asymmetry, is, noted, in, schizophrenia, studies, have, concluded, that, the, link, is, a, true, and, verifiable, effect, that, may, reflect, a, genetic, link, between, lateralization, and, schizophrenia, bayesian, models, of, brain, functioning, have, been, used, to, link, abnormalities, in, cellular, functioning, to, symptoms, both, hallucinations, and, delusions, have, been, suggested, to, reflect, improper, encoding, of, prior, expectations, thereby, causing, expectation, to, excessively, influence, sensory, perception, and, the, formation, of, beliefs, in, approved, models, of, circuits, that, mediate, predictive, coding, reduced, nmda, receptor, activation, could, in, theory, result, in, the, positive, symptoms, of, delusions, and, hallucinations, schizophrenia, is, diagnosed, based, on, criteria, in, either, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, published, by, the, american, psychiatric, association, or, the, international, statistical, classification, of, diseases, and, related, health, problems, icd, published, by, the, world, health, organization, who, these, criteria, use, the, self, reported, experiences, of, the, person, and, reported, abnormalities, in, behavior, followed, by, a, psychiatric, assessment, the, mental, status, examination, is, an, important, part, of, the, assessment, an, established, tool, for, assessing, the, severity, of, positive, and, negative, symptoms, is, the, positive, and, negative, syndrome, scale, panss, this, has, been, seen, to, have, shortcomings, relating, to, negative, symptoms, and, other, scales, the, clinical, assessment, interview, for, negative, symptoms, cains, and, the, brief, negative, symptoms, scale, bnss, have, been, introduced, the, dsm, 5, published, in, 2013, gives, a, scale, to, assess, the, severity, of, symptom, dimensions, outlining, eight, dimensions, of, symptoms, dsm, 5, states, that, to, be, diagnosed, with, schizophrenia, two, diagnostic, criteria, have, to, be, met, over, the, period, of, one, month, with, a, significant, impact, on, social, or, occupational, functioning, for, at, least, six, months, one, of, the, symptoms, needs, to, be, either, delusions, hallucinations, or, disorganized, speech, a, second, symptom, could, be, one, of, the, negative, symptoms, or, severely, disorganized, or, catatonic, behaviour, a, different, diagnosis, of, schizophreniform, disorder, can, be, made, before, the, six, months, needed, for, the, diagnosis, of, schizophrenia, in, australia, the, guideline, for, diagnosis, is, for, six, months, or, more, with, symptoms, severe, enough, to, affect, ordinary, functioning, in, the, uk, diagnosis, is, based, on, having, the, symptoms, for, most, of, the, time, for, one, month, with, symptoms, that, significantly, affect, the, ability, to, work, study, or, carry, on, ordinary, daily, living, and, with, other, similar, conditions, ruled, out, the, icd, criteria, are, typically, used, in, european, countries, the, dsm, criteria, are, used, predominantly, in, the, united, states, and, canada, and, are, prevailing, in, research, studies, in, practice, agreement, between, the, two, systems, is, high, the, current, proposal, for, the, icd, 11, criteria, for, schizophrenia, recommends, adding, self, disorder, as, a, symptom, a, major, unresolved, difference, between, the, two, diagnostic, systems, is, that, of, the, requirement, in, dsm, of, an, impaired, functional, outcome, who, for, icd, argues, that, not, all, people, with, schizophrenia, have, functional, deficits, and, so, these, are, not, specific, for, the, diagnosis, many, people, with, schizophrenia, may, have, one, or, more, other, mental, disorders, such, as, anxiety, disorders, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, or, substance, use, disorder, these, are, separate, disorders, that, require, treatment, when, comorbid, with, schizophrenia, substance, use, disorder, and, antisocial, personality, disorder, both, increase, the, risk, for, violence, comorbid, substance, use, disorder, also, increases, the, risk, of, suicide, sleep, disorders, often, co, occur, with, schizophrenia, and, may, be, an, early, sign, of, relapse, sleep, disorders, are, linked, with, positive, symptoms, such, as, disorganized, thinking, and, can, adversely, affect, cortical, plasticity, and, cognition, the, consolidation, of, memories, is, disrupted, in, sleep, disorders, they, are, associated, with, severity, of, illness, a, poor, prognosis, and, poor, quality, of, life, sleep, onset, and, maintenance, insomnia, is, a, common, symptom, regardless, of, whether, treatment, has, been, received, or, not, genetic, variations, have, been, found, associated, with, these, conditions, involving, the, circadian, rhythm, dopamine, and, histamine, metabolism, and, signal, transduction, schizophrenia, is, also, associated, with, a, number, of, somatic, comorbidities, including, diabetes, mellitus, type, 2, autoimmune, diseases, and, cardiovascular, diseases, the, association, of, these, with, schizophrenia, may, be, partially, due, to, medications, e, g, dyslipidemia, from, antipsychotics, environmental, factors, e, g, complications, from, an, increased, rate, of, cigarette, smoking, or, associated, with, the, disorder, itself, e, g, diabetes, mellitus, type, 2, and, some, cardiovascular, diseases, are, thought, to, be, genetically, linked, these, somatic, comorbidities, contribute, to, reduced, life, expectancy, among, persons, with, the, disorder, to, make, a, diagnosis, of, schizophrenia, other, possible, causes, of, psychosis, need, to, be, excluded, 858, psychotic, symptoms, lasting, less, than, a, month, may, be, diagnosed, as, brief, psychotic, disorder, or, as, schizophreniform, disorder, psychosis, is, noted, in, other, specified, schizophrenia, spectrum, and, other, psychotic, disorders, as, a, dsm, 5, category, schizoaffective, disorder, is, diagnosed, if, symptoms, of, mood, disorder, are, substantially, present, alongside, psychotic, symptoms, psychosis, that, results, from, a, general, medical, condition, or, substance, is, termed, secondary, psychosis, psychotic, symptoms, may, be, present, in, several, other, conditions, including, bipolar, disorder, borderline, personality, disorder, substance, intoxication, substance, induced, psychosis, and, a, number, of, drug, withdrawal, syndromes, non, bizarre, delusions, are, also, present, in, delusional, disorder, and, social, withdrawal, in, social, anxiety, disorder, avoidant, personality, disorder, and, schizotypal, personality, disorder, schizotypal, personality, disorder, has, symptoms, that, are, similar, but, less, severe, than, those, of, schizophrenia, schizophrenia, occurs, along, with, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, ocd, considerably, more, often, than, could, be, explained, by, chance, although, it, can, be, difficult, to, distinguish, obsessions, that, occur, in, ocd, from, the, delusions, of, schizophrenia, there, can, be, considerable, overlap, with, the, symptoms, of, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, a, more, general, medical, and, neurological, examination, may, be, needed, to, rule, out, medical, illnesses, which, may, rarely, produce, psychotic, schizophrenia, like, symptoms, such, as, metabolic, disturbance, systemic, infection, syphilis, hiv, associated, neurocognitive, disorder, epilepsy, limbic, encephalitis, and, brain, lesions, stroke, multiple, sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and, dementias, such, as, alzheimer, s, disease, huntington, s, disease, frontotemporal, dementia, and, the, lewy, body, dementias, may, also, be, associated, with, schizophrenia, like, psychotic, symptoms, it, may, be, necessary, to, rule, out, a, delirium, which, can, be, distinguished, by, visual, hallucinations, acute, onset, and, fluctuating, level, of, consciousness, and, indicates, an, underlying, medical, illness, investigations, are, not, generally, repeated, for, relapse, unless, there, is, a, specific, medical, indication, or, possible, adverse, effects, from, antipsychotic, medication, in, children, hallucinations, must, be, separated, from, typical, childhood, fantasies, it, is, difficult, to, distinguish, childhood, schizophrenia, from, autism, prevention, of, schizophrenia, is, difficult, as, there, are, no, reliable, markers, for, the, later, development, of, the, disorder, early, intervention, programs, diagnose, and, treat, patients, in, the, prodromal, phase, of, the, illness, there, is, some, evidence, that, these, programs, reduce, symptoms, patients, tend, to, prefer, early, treatment, programs, to, ordinary, treatment, and, are, less, likely, to, disengage, from, them, as, of, 2020, it, is, unclear, whether, the, benefits, of, early, treatment, persist, once, the, treatment, is, terminated, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, may, reduce, the, risk, of, psychosis, in, those, at, high, risk, after, a, year, and, is, recommended, in, this, group, by, the, national, institute, for, health, and, care, excellence, nice, another, preventive, measure, is, to, avoid, drugs, that, have, been, associated, with, development, of, the, disorder, including, cannabis, cocaine, and, amphetamines, antipsychotics, are, prescribed, following, a, first, episode, psychosis, and, following, remission, a, preventive, maintenance, use, is, continued, to, avoid, relapse, however, it, is, recognized, that, some, people, do, recover, following, a, single, episode, and, that, long, term, use, of, antipsychotics, will, not, be, needed, but, there, is, no, way, of, identifying, this, group, the, primary, treatment, of, schizophrenia, is, the, use, of, antipsychotic, medications, often, in, combination, with, psychosocial, interventions, and, social, supports, community, support, services, including, drop, in, centers, visits, by, members, of, a, community, mental, health, team, supported, employment, and, support, groups, are, common, the, time, between, the, onset, of, psychotic, symptoms, to, being, given, treatment, the, duration, of, untreated, psychosis, dup, is, associated, with, a, poorer, outcome, in, both, the, short, term, and, the, long, term, voluntary, or, involuntary, admission, to, hospital, may, be, imposed, by, doctors, and, courts, who, deem, a, person, to, be, having, a, severe, episode, in, the, uk, large, mental, hospitals, termed, asylums, began, to, be, closed, down, in, the, 1950s, with, the, advent, of, antipsychotics, and, with, an, awareness, of, the, negative, impact, of, long, term, hospital, stays, on, recovery, this, process, was, known, as, deinstitutionalization, and, community, and, supportive, services, were, developed, to, support, this, change, many, other, countries, followed, suit, with, the, us, starting, in, the, 60s, there, still, remain, a, smaller, group, of, people, who, do, not, improve, enough, to, be, discharged, in, some, countries, that, lack, the, necessary, supportive, and, social, services, long, term, hospital, stays, are, more, usual, the, first, line, treatment, for, schizophrenia, is, an, antipsychotic, the, first, generation, antipsychotics, now, called, typical, antipsychotics, like, flupentixol, are, dopamine, antagonists, that, block, d2, receptors, and, affect, the, neurotransmission, of, dopamine, those, brought, out, later, the, second, generation, antipsychotics, known, as, atypical, antipsychotics, including, olanzapine, and, risperidone, can, also, have, an, effect, on, another, neurotransmitter, serotonin, antipsychotics, can, reduce, the, symptoms, of, anxiety, within, hours, of, their, use, but, for, other, symptoms, they, may, take, several, days, or, weeks, to, reach, their, full, effect, they, have, little, effect, on, negative, and, cognitive, symptoms, which, may, be, helped, by, additional, psychotherapies, and, medications, there, is, no, single, antipsychotic, suitable, for, first, line, treatment, for, everyone, as, responses, and, tolerances, vary, between, people, stopping, medication, may, be, considered, after, a, single, psychotic, episode, where, there, has, been, a, full, recovery, with, no, symptoms, for, twelve, months, repeated, relapses, worsen, the, long, term, outlook, and, the, risk, of, relapse, following, a, second, episode, is, high, and, long, term, treatment, is, usually, recommended, about, half, of, those, with, schizophrenia, will, respond, favourably, to, antipsychotics, and, have, a, good, return, of, functioning, however, positive, symptoms, persist, in, up, to, a, third, of, people, following, two, trials, of, different, antipsychotics, over, six, weeks, that, also, prove, ineffective, they, will, be, classed, as, having, treatment, resistant, schizophrenia, trs, and, clozapine, will, be, offered, clozapine, is, of, benefit, to, around, half, of, this, group, although, it, has, the, potentially, serious, side, effect, of, agranulocytosis, lowered, white, blood, cell, count, in, less, than, 4, of, people, about, 30, to, 50, percent, of, people, with, schizophrenia, do, not, accept, that, they, have, an, illness, or, comply, with, their, recommended, treatment, for, those, who, are, unwilling, or, unable, to, take, medication, regularly, long, acting, injections, of, antipsychotics, may, be, used, which, reduce, the, risk, of, relapse, to, a, greater, degree, than, oral, medications, when, used, in, combination, with, psychosocial, interventions, they, may, improve, long, term, adherence, to, treatment, extrapyramidal, symptoms, including, akathisia, are, associated, with, all, commercially, available, antipsychotic, to, varying, degrees, 566, there, is, little, evidence, that, second, generation, antipsychotics, have, reduced, levels, of, extrapyramidical, symptoms, compared, to, typical, antipsychotics, 566, tardive, dyskinesia, can, occur, due, to, long, term, use, of, antipsychotics, developing, after, months, or, years, of, use, the, antipsychotic, clozapine, is, also, associated, with, thromboembolism, including, pulmonary, embolism, myocarditis, and, cardiomyopathy, a, number, of, psychosocial, interventions, that, include, several, types, of, psychotherapy, may, be, useful, in, the, treatment, of, schizophrenia, such, as, family, therapy, group, therapy, cognitive, remediation, therapy, crt, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, and, metacognitive, training, skills, training, help, with, substance, use, and, weight, management, often, needed, as, a, side, effect, of, an, antipsychotic, are, also, offered, in, the, us, interventions, for, first, episode, psychosis, have, been, brought, together, in, an, overall, approach, known, as, coordinated, speciality, care, csc, and, also, includes, support, for, education, in, the, uk, care, across, all, phases, is, a, similar, approach, that, covers, many, of, the, treatment, guidelines, recommended, the, aim, is, to, reduce, the, number, of, relapses, and, stays, in, the, hospital, other, support, services, for, education, employment, and, housing, are, usually, offered, for, people, with, severe, schizophrenia, who, are, discharged, from, a, stay, in, the, hospital, these, services, are, often, brought, together, in, an, integrated, approach, to, offer, support, in, the, community, away, from, the, hospital, setting, in, addition, to, medicine, management, housing, and, finances, assistance, is, given, for, more, routine, matters, such, as, help, with, shopping, and, using, public, transport, this, approach, is, known, as, assertive, community, treatment, act, and, has, been, shown, to, achieve, positive, results, in, symptoms, social, functioning, and, quality, of, life, another, more, intense, approach, is, known, as, intensive, care, management, icm, icm, is, a, stage, further, than, act, and, emphasises, support, of, high, intensity, in, smaller, caseloads, less, than, twenty, this, approach, is, to, provide, long, term, care, in, the, community, studies, show, that, icm, improves, many, of, the, relevant, outcomes, including, social, functioning, some, studies, have, shown, little, evidence, for, the, effectiveness, of, cbt, in, either, reducing, symptoms, or, preventing, relapse, however, other, studies, have, found, that, cbt, does, improve, overall, psychotic, symptoms, when, in, use, with, medication, and, it, has, been, recommended, in, canada, but, has, been, seen, to, have, no, effect, on, social, function, relapse, or, quality, of, life, in, the, uk, it, is, recommended, as, an, add, on, therapy, in, the, treatment, of, schizophrenia, arts, therapies, are, seen, to, improve, negative, symptoms, in, some, people, and, are, recommended, by, nice, in, the, uk, this, approach, is, criticised, as, having, not, been, well, researched, and, arts, therapies, are, not, recommended, in, australian, guidelines, for, example, peer, support, in, which, people, with, personal, experience, of, schizophrenia, provide, help, to, each, other, is, of, unclear, benefit, exercise, including, aerobic, exercise, has, been, shown, to, improve, positive, and, negative, symptoms, cognition, working, memory, and, improve, quality, of, life, exercise, has, also, been, shown, to, increase, the, volume, of, the, hippocampus, in, those, with, schizophrenia, a, decrease, in, hippocampal, volume, is, one, of, the, factors, linked, to, the, development, of, the, disease, however, there, still, remains, the, problem, of, increasing, motivation, for, and, maintaining, participation, in, physical, activity, supervised, sessions, are, recommended, in, the, uk, healthy, eating, advice, is, offered, alongside, exercise, programs, an, inadequate, diet, is, often, found, in, schizophrenia, and, associated, vitamin, deficiencies, including, those, of, folate, and, vitamin, d, are, linked, to, the, risk, factors, for, the, development, of, schizophrenia, and, for, early, death, including, heart, disease, those, with, schizophrenia, possibly, have, the, worst, diet, of, all, the, mental, disorders, lower, levels, of, folate, and, vitamin, d, have, been, noted, as, significantly, lower, in, first, episode, psychosis, the, use, of, supplemental, folate, is, recommended, a, zinc, deficiency, has, also, been, noted, vitamin, b, 12, is, also, often, deficient, and, this, is, linked, to, worse, symptoms, supplementation, with, b, vitamins, has, been, shown, to, significantly, improve, symptoms, and, to, put, in, reverse, some, of, the, cognitive, deficits, it, is, also, suggested, that, the, noted, dysfunction, in, gut, microbiota, might, benefit, from, the, use, of, probiotics, schizophrenia, has, great, human, and, economic, costs, it, decreases, life, expectancy, by, between, 10, and, 28, years, this, is, primarily, because, of, its, association, with, heart, disease, diabetes, obesity, poor, diet, a, sedentary, lifestyle, and, smoking, with, an, increased, rate, of, suicide, playing, a, lesser, role, side, effects, of, antipsychotics, may, also, increase, the, risk, almost, 40, of, those, with, schizophrenia, die, from, complications, of, cardiovascular, disease, which, is, seen, to, be, increasingly, associated, an, underlying, factor, of, sudden, cardiac, death, may, be, brugada, syndrome, brs, brs, mutations, that, overlap, with, those, linked, with, schizophrenia, are, the, calcium, channel, mutations, brs, may, also, be, drug, induced, from, certain, antipsychotics, and, antidepressants, primary, polydipsia, or, excessive, fluid, intake, is, relatively, common, in, people, with, chronic, schizophrenia, this, may, lead, to, hyponatremia, which, can, be, life, threatening, antipsychotics, can, lead, to, a, dry, mouth, but, there, are, several, other, factors, that, may, contribute, to, the, disorder, it, may, reduce, life, expectancy, by, 13, percent, barriers, to, improving, the, mortality, rate, in, schizophrenia, are, poverty, overlooking, the, symptoms, of, other, illnesses, stress, stigma, and, medication, side, effects, schizophrenia, is, a, major, cause, of, disability, in, 2016, it, was, classed, as, the, 12th, most, disabling, condition, approximately, 75, of, people, with, schizophrenia, have, ongoing, disability, with, relapses, some, people, do, recover, completely, and, others, function, well, in, society, most, people, with, schizophrenia, live, independently, with, community, support, about, 85, are, unemployed, in, people, with, a, first, episode, of, psychosis, in, schizophrenia, a, good, long, term, outcome, occurs, in, 31, an, intermediate, outcome, in, 42, and, a, poor, outcome, in, 31, males, are, affected, more, often, than, females, and, have, a, worse, outcome, studies, showing, that, outcomes, for, schizophrenia, appear, better, in, the, developing, than, the, developed, world, have, been, questioned, social, problems, such, as, long, term, unemployment, poverty, homelessness, exploitation, stigmatization, and, victimization, are, common, consequences, and, lead, to, social, exclusion, there, is, a, higher, than, average, suicide, rate, associated, with, schizophrenia, estimated, at, 5, to, 6, most, often, occurring, in, the, period, following, onset, or, first, hospital, admission, several, times, more, 20, to, 40, attempt, suicide, at, least, once, there, are, a, variety, of, risk, factors, including, male, sex, depression, a, high, iq, heavy, smoking, and, substance, use, repeated, relapse, is, linked, to, an, increased, risk, of, suicidal, behavior, the, use, of, clozapine, can, reduce, the, risk, of, suicide, and, of, aggression, a, strong, association, between, schizophrenia, and, tobacco, smoking, has, been, shown, in, worldwide, studies, smoking, is, especially, high, in, those, diagnosed, with, schizophrenia, with, estimates, ranging, from, 80, to, 90, being, regular, smokers, as, compared, to, 20, of, the, general, population, those, who, smoke, tend, to, smoke, heavily, and, additionally, smoke, cigarettes, with, high, nicotine, content, some, propose, that, this, is, in, an, effort, to, improve, symptoms, among, people, with, schizophrenia, use, of, cannabis, is, also, common, schizophrenia, leads, to, an, increased, risk, of, dementia, most, people, with, schizophrenia, are, not, aggressive, and, are, more, likely, to, be, victims, of, violence, rather, than, perpetrators, people, with, schizophrenia, are, commonly, exploited, and, victimized, by, violent, crime, as, part, of, a, broader, dynamic, of, social, exclusion, people, diagnosed, with, schizophrenia, are, also, subject, to, forced, drug, injections, seclusion, and, restraint, at, high, rates, the, risk, of, violence, by, people, with, schizophrenia, is, small, there, are, minor, subgroups, where, the, risk, is, high, this, risk, is, usually, associated, with, a, comorbid, disorder, such, as, a, substance, use, disorder, in, particular, alcohol, or, with, antisocial, personality, disorder, substance, use, disorder, is, strongly, linked, and, other, risk, factors, are, linked, to, deficits, in, cognition, and, social, cognition, including, facial, perception, and, insight, that, are, in, part, included, in, theory, of, mind, impairments, poor, cognitive, functioning, decision, making, and, facial, perception, may, contribute, to, making, a, wrong, judgement, of, a, situation, that, could, result, in, an, inappropriate, response, such, as, violence, these, associated, risk, factors, are, also, present, in, antisocial, personality, disorder, which, when, present, as, a, comorbid, disorder, greatly, increases, the, risk, of, violence, in, 2017, the, global, burden, of, disease, study, estimated, there, were, 1, 1, million, new, cases, in, 2022, the, world, health, organization, who, reported, a, total, of, 24, million, cases, globally, schizophrenia, affects, around, 0, 3, 0, 7, of, people, at, some, point, in, their, life, in, areas, of, conflict, this, figure, can, rise, to, between, 4, 0, and, 6, 5, it, occurs, 1, 4, times, more, frequently, in, males, than, females, and, typically, appears, earlier, in, men, worldwide, schizophrenia, is, the, most, common, psychotic, disorder, the, frequency, of, schizophrenia, varies, across, the, world, within, countries, and, at, the, local, and, neighborhood, level, this, variation, in, prevalence, between, studies, over, time, across, geographical, locations, and, by, gender, is, as, high, as, fivefold, schizophrenia, causes, approximately, one, percent, of, worldwide, disability, adjusted, life, years, and, resulted, in, 17, 000, deaths, in, 2015, in, 2000, who, found, the, percentage, of, people, affected, and, the, number, of, new, cases, that, develop, each, year, is, roughly, similar, around, the, world, with, age, standardized, prevalence, per, 100, 000, ranging, from, 343, in, africa, to, 544, in, japan, and, oceania, for, men, and, from, 378, in, africa, to, 527, in, southeastern, europe, for, women, accounts, of, a, schizophrenia, like, syndrome, are, rare, in, records, before, the, 19th, century, the, earliest, case, reports, were, in, 1797, and, 1809, dementia, praecox, meaning, premature, dementia, was, used, by, german, psychiatrist, heinrich, sch, le, in, 1886, and, then, in, 1891, by, arnold, pick, in, a, case, report, of, hebephrenia, in, 1893, emil, kraepelin, used, the, term, in, making, a, distinction, known, as, the, kraepelinian, dichotomy, between, the, two, psychoses, dementia, praecox, and, manic, depression, now, called, bipolar, disorder, when, it, became, evident, that, the, disorder, was, not, a, degenerative, dementia, it, was, renamed, schizophrenia, by, eugen, bleuler, in, 1908, the, word, schizophrenia, translates, as, splitting, of, the, mind, and, is, modern, latin, from, the, greek, words, schizein, ancient, greek, lit, to, split, and, phr, n, ancient, greek, lit, mind, its, use, was, intended, to, describe, the, separation, of, function, between, personality, thinking, memory, and, perception, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, psychiatrist, kurt, schneider, categorized, the, psychotic, symptoms, of, schizophrenia, into, two, groups, hallucinations, and, delusions, the, hallucinations, were, listed, as, specific, to, auditory, and, the, delusions, included, thought, disorders, these, were, seen, as, important, symptoms, termed, first, rank, the, most, common, first, rank, symptom, was, found, to, belong, to, thought, disorders, in, 2013, the, first, rank, symptoms, were, excluded, from, the, dsm, 5, criteria, while, they, may, not, be, useful, in, diagnosing, schizophrenia, they, can, assist, in, differential, diagnosis, subtypes, of, schizophrenia, classified, as, paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated, and, residual, were, difficult, to, distinguish, and, are, no, longer, recognized, as, separate, conditions, by, dsm, 5, 2013, or, icd, 11, before, the, 1960s, nonviolent, petty, criminals, and, women, were, sometimes, diagnosed, with, schizophrenia, categorizing, the, latter, as, ill, for, not, performing, their, duties, within, patriarchy, as, wives, and, mothers, in, the, mid, to, late, 1960s, black, men, were, categorized, as, hostile, and, aggressive, and, diagnosed, as, schizophrenic, at, much, higher, rates, their, civil, rights, and, black, power, activism, labeled, as, delusions, in, the, early, 1970s, in, the, us, the, diagnostic, model, for, schizophrenia, was, broad, and, clinically, based, using, dsm, ii, schizophrenia, was, diagnosed, far, more, in, the, us, than, in, europe, which, used, the, icd, 9, criteria, the, us, model, was, criticised, for, failing, to, demarcate, clearly, those, people, with, a, mental, illness, in, 1980, dsm, iii, was, published, and, showed, a, shift, in, focus, from, the, clinically, based, biopsychosocial, model, to, a, reason, based, medical, model, dsm, iv, brought, an, increased, focus, on, an, evidence, based, medical, model, in, the, 1930s, a, number, of, shock, procedures, which, induced, seizures, convulsions, or, comas, were, used, to, treat, schizophrenia, insulin, shock, involved, injecting, large, doses, of, insulin, to, induce, comas, which, in, turn, produced, hypoglycemia, and, convulsions, the, use, of, electricity, to, induce, seizures, was, in, use, as, electroconvulsive, therapy, ect, by, 1938, psychosurgery, including, the, lobotomy, and, frontal, lobotomy, carried, out, from, the, 1930s, until, the, 1970s, in, the, united, states, and, until, the, 1980s, in, france, are, recognized, as, a, human, rights, abuse, in, the, mid, 1950s, the, first, typical, antipsychotic, chlorpromazine, was, introduced, followed, in, the, 1970s, by, the, first, atypical, antipsychotic,

the, assumption, that, symptoms, would, later, appear, now, discredited, the, diagnosis, provided, a, convenient, way, to, confine, political, dissidents, in, the, united, states, the, annual, cost, of, schizophrenia, including, direct, costs, outpatient, inpatient, drugs, and, long, term, care, and, non, healthcare, costs, law, enforcement, reduced, workplace, productivity, and, unemployment, was, estimated, at, 62, 7, billion, for, the, year, 2002, in, the, uk, the, cost, in, 2016, was, put, at, 11, 8, billion, per, year, with, a, third, of, that, figure, directly, attributable, to, the, cost, of, hospital, social, care, and, treatment, in, 2002, the, term, for, schizophrenia, in, japan, was, changed, from, seishin, bunretsu, by, lit, mind, split, disease, to, t, g, shitch, sh, lit, integration, dysregulation, syndrome, to, reduce, stigma, the, new, name, also, interpreted, as, integration, disorder, was, inspired, by, the, biopsychosocial, model, a, similar, change, was, made, in, south, korea, in, 2012, to, attunement, disorder, media, coverage, especially, movies, reinforce, the, public, perception, of, an, association, between, schizophrenia, and, violence, a, majority, of, movies, have, historically, depicted, characters, with, schizophrenia, as, criminal, dangerous, violent, unpredictable, and, homicidal, and, depicted, delusions, and, hallucinations, as, the, main, symptoms, of, schizophrenic, characters, ignoring, other, common, symptoms, furthering, stereotypes, of, schizophrenia, including, the, idea, of, a, split, personality, the, book, a, beautiful,

with, the, same, name, an, earlier, documentary, film, was, a, brilliant, madness, in, the, uk, guidelines, for, reporting, conditions, and, award, campaigns, have, shown, a, reduction, in, negative, reporting, since, 2013, in, 1964, a, case, study, of, three, males, diagnosed, with, schizophrenia, who, each, had, the, delusional, belief, that, they, were, jesus, christ, was, published, as, the, three, christs, of, ypsilanti, a, film, with, the, title, three, christs, was, released, in, 2020, a, 2015, cochrane, review, found, unclear, evidence, of, benefit, from, brain, stimulation, techniques, to, treat, the, positive, symptoms, of, schizophrenia, in, particular, auditory, verbal, hallucinations, avhs, most, studies, focus, on, transcranial, direct, current, stimulation, tdcm, and, repetitive, transcranial, magnetic, stimulation, rtms, techniques, based, on, focused, ultrasound, for, deep, brain, stimulation, could, provide, insight, for, the, treatment, of, avhs, the, study, of, potential, biomarkers, that, would, help, in, diagnosis, and, treatment, of, schizophrenia, is, an, active, area, of, research, as, of, 2020, possible, biomarkers, include, markers, of, inflammation, neuroimaging, brain, derived, neurotrophic, factor, bdnf, and, speech, analysis, some, markers, such, as, c, reactive, protein, are, useful, in, detecting, levels, of, inflammation, implicated, in, some, psychiatric, disorders, but, they, are, not, disorder, specific, other, inflammatory, cytokines, are, found, to, be, elevated, in, first, episode, psychosis, and, acute, relapse, that, are, normalized, after, treatment, with, antipsychotics, and, these, may, be, considered, as, state, markers, deficits, in, sleep, spindles, in, schizophrenia, may, serve, as, a, marker, of, an, impaired, thalamocortical, circuit, and, a, mechanism, for, memory, impairment, micrornas, are, highly, influential, in, early, neuronal, development, and, their, disruption, is, implicated, in, several, cns, disorders, circulating, micrornas, cimirnas, are, found, in, body, fluids, such, as, blood, and, cerebrospinal, fluid, and, changes, in, their, levels, are, seen, to, relate, to, changes, in, microrna, levels, in, specific, regions, of, brain, tissue, these, studies, suggest, that, cimirnas, have, the, potential, to, be, early, and, accurate, biomarkers, in, a, number, of, disorders, including, schizophrenia
