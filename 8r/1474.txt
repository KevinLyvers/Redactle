a, vegetative, state, vs, or, post, coma, unresponsiveness, pcu, is, a, disorder, of, consciousness, in, which, patients, with, severe, brain, damage, are, in, a, state, of, partial, arousal, rather, than, true, awareness, after, four, weeks, in, a, vegetative, state, the, patient, is, classified, as, being, in, a, persistent, vegetative, state, pvs, this, diagnosis, is, classified, as, a, permanent, vegetative, state, some, months, three, in, the, us, and, six, in, the, uk, after, a, non, traumatic, brain, injury, or, one, year, after, a, traumatic, injury, the, term, unresponsive, wakefulness, syndrome, may, be, used, alternatively, as, vegetative, state, has, some, negative, connotations, among, the, public, there, are, several, definitions, that, vary, by, technical, versus, layman, s, usage, there, are, different, legal, implications, in, different, countries, per, the, definition, of, the, british, royal, college, of, physicians, of, london, a, wakeful, unconscious, state, that, lasts, longer, than, a, few, weeks, is, referred, to, as, a, persistent, or, continuing, vegetative, state, the, vegetative, state, is, a, chronic, or, long, term, condition, this, condition, differs, from, a, coma, a, coma, is, a, state, that, lacks, both, awareness, and, wakefulness, patients, in, a, vegetative, state, may, have, awoken, from, a, coma, but, still, have, not, regained, awareness, in, the, vegetative, state, patients, can, open, their, eyelids, occasionally, and, demonstrate, sleep, wake, cycles, but, completely, lack, cognitive, function, the, vegetative, state, is, also, called, a, coma, vigil, the, chances, of, regaining, awareness, diminish, considerably, as, the, time, spent, in, the, vegetative, state, increases, persistent, vegetative, state, is, the, standard, usage, except, in, the, uk, for, a, medical, diagnosis, made, after, numerous, neurological, and, other, tests, that, due, to, extensive, and, irreversible, brain, damage, a, patient, is, highly, unlikely, ever, to, achieve, higher, functions, above, a, vegetative, state, this, diagnosis, does, not, mean, that, a, doctor, has, diagnosed, improvement, as, impossible, but, does, open, the, possibility, in, the, us, for, a, judicial, request, to, end, life, support, informal, guidelines, hold, that, this, diagnosis, can, be, made, after, four, weeks, in, a, vegetative, state, us, caselaw, has, shown, that, successful, petitions, for, termination, have, been, made, after, a, diagnosis, of, a, persistent, vegetative, state, although, in, some, cases, such, as, that, of, terri, schiavo, such, rulings, have, generated, widespread, controversy, in, the, uk, the, term, is, discouraged, in, favor, of, two, more, precisely, defined, terms, that, have, been, strongly, recommended, by, the, royal, college, of, physicians, rcp, these, guidelines, recommend, using, a, continuous, vegetative, state, for, patients, in, a, vegetative, state, for, more, than, four, weeks, a, medical, determination, of, a, permanent, vegetative, state, can, be, made, if, after, exhaustive, testing, and, a, customary, 12, months, of, observation, a, medical, diagnosis, is, made, that, it, is, impossible, by, any, informed, medical, expectations, that, the, mental, condition, will, ever, improve, hence, a, continuous, vegetative, state, in, the, uk, may, remain, the, diagnosis, in, cases, that, would, be, called, persistent, in, the, us, or, elsewhere, while, the, actual, testing, criteria, for, a, diagnosis, of, permanent, in, the, uk, are, quite, similar, to, the, criteria, for, a, diagnosis, of, persistent, in, the, us, the, semantic, difference, imparts, in, the, uk, a, legal, presumption, that, is, commonly, used, in, court, applications, for, ending, life, support, the, uk, diagnosis, is, generally, only, made, after, 12, months, of, observing, a, static, vegetative, state, a, diagnosis, of, a, persistent, vegetative, state, in, the, us, usually, still, requires, a, petitioner, to, prove, in, court, that, recovery, is, impossible, by, informed, medical, opinion, while, in, the, uk, the, permanent, diagnosis, already, gives, the, petitioner, this, presumption, and, may, make, the, legal, process, less, time, consuming, in, common, usage, the, permanent, and, persistent, definitions, are, sometimes, conflated, and, used, interchangeably, however, the, acronym, pvs, is, intended, to, define, a, persistent, vegetative, state, without, necessarily, the, connotations, of, permanence, and, is, used, as, such, throughout, this, article, bryan, jennett, who, originally, coined, the, term, persistent, vegetative, state, has, now, recommended, using, the, uk, division, between, continuous, and, permanent, in, his, book, the, vegetative, state, arguing, that, the, persistent, component, of, this, term, may, seem, to, suggest, irreversibility, the, australian, national, health, and, medical, research, council, has, suggested, post, coma, unresponsiveness, as, an, alternative, term, for, vegetative, state, in, general, unlike, brain, death, permanent, vegetative, state, pvs, is, recognized, by, statute, law, as, death, in, only, a, very, few, legal, systems, in, the, us, courts, have, required, petitions, before, termination, of, life, support, that, demonstrate, that, any, recovery, of, cognitive, functions, above, a, vegetative, state, is, assessed, as, impossible, by, authoritative, medical, opinion, in, england, wales, and, scotland, the, legal, precedent, for, withdrawal, of, clinically, assisted, nutrition, and, hydration, in, cases, of, patients, in, a, pvs, was, set, in, 1993, in, the, case, of, tony, bland, who, sustained, catastrophic, anoxic, brain, injury, in, the, 1989, hillsborough, disaster, an, application, to, the, court, of, protection, is, no, longer, required, before, nutrition, and, hydration, can, be, withdrawn, or, withheld, from, pvs, or, minimally, conscious, mcs, patients, this, legal, grey, area, has, led, to, vocal, advocates, that, those, in, pvs, should, be, allowed, to, die, others, are, equally, determined, that, if, recovery, is, at, all, possible, care, should, continue, the, existence, of, a, small, number, of, diagnosed, pvs, cases, that, have, eventually, resulted, in, improvement, makes, defining, recovery, as, impossible, particularly, difficult, in, a, legal, sense, this, legal, and, ethical, issue, raises, questions, about, autonomy, quality, of, life, appropriate, use, of, resources, the, wishes, of, family, members, and, professional, responsibilities, most, pvs, patients, are, unresponsive, to, external, stimuli, and, their, conditions, are, associated, with, different, levels, of, consciousness, some, level, of, consciousness, means, a, person, can, still, respond, in, varying, degrees, to, stimulation, a, person, in, a, coma, however, cannot, in, addition, pvs, patients, often, open, their, eyes, in, response, to, feeding, which, has, to, be, done, by, others, they, are, capable, of, swallowing, whereas, patients, in, a, coma, subsist, with, their, eyes, closed, cerebral, cortical, function, e, g, communication, thinking, purposeful, movement, etc, is, lost, while, brainstem, functions, e, g, breathing, maintaining, circulation, and, hemodynamic, stability, etc, are, preserved, non, cognitive, upper, brainstem, functions, such, as, eye, opening, occasional, vocalizations, e, g, crying, laughing, maintaining, normal, sleep, patterns, and, spontaneous, non, purposeful, movements, often, remain, intact, pvs, patients, eyes, might, be, in, a, relatively, fixed, position, or, track, moving, objects, or, move, in, a, disconjugate, i, e, completely, unsynchronized, manner, they, may, experience, sleep, wake, cycles, or, be, in, a, state, of, chronic, wakefulness, they, may, exhibit, some, behaviors, that, can, be, construed, as, arising, from, partial, consciousness, such, as, grinding, their, teeth, swallowing, smiling, shedding, tears, grunting, moaning, or, screaming, without, any, apparent, external, stimulus, individuals, in, pvs, are, seldom, on, any, life, sustaining, equipment, other, than, a, feeding, tube, because, the, brainstem, the, center, of, vegetative, functions, such, as, heart, rate, and, rhythm, respiration, and, gastrointestinal, activity, is, relatively, intact, many, people, emerge, spontaneously, from, a, vegetative, state, within, a, few, weeks, the, chances, of, recovery, depend, on, the, extent, of, injury, to, the, brain, and, the, patient, s, age, younger, patients, having, a, better, chance, of, recovery, than, older, patients, a, 1994, report, found, that, of, those, who, were, in, a, vegetative, state, a, month, after, a, trauma, 54, had, regained, consciousness, by, a, year, after, the, trauma, whereas, 28, had, died, and, 18, were, still, in, the, vegetative, state, for, non, traumatic, injuries, such, as, strokes, only, 14, had, recovered, consciousness, at, one, year, 47, had, died, and, 39, were, still, vegetative, patients, who, were, vegetative, six, months, after, the, initial, event, were, much, less, likely, to, have, recovered, consciousness, a, year, after, the, event, than, in, the, case, of, those, who, were, simply, reported, vegetative, at, one, month, a, new, scientist, article, from, 2000, gives, a, pair, of, graphs, showing, changes, of, patient, status, during, the, first, 12, months, after, head, injury, and, after, incidents, depriving, the, brain, of, oxygen, after, a, year, the, chances, that, a, pvs, patient, will, regain, consciousness, are, very, low, and, most, patients, who, do, recover, consciousness, experience, significant, disability, the, longer, a, patient, is, in, a, pvs, the, more, severe, the, resulting, disabilities, are, likely, to, be, rehabilitation, can, contribute, to, recovery, but, many, patients, never, progress, to, the, point, of, being, able, to, take, care, of, themselves, the, medical, literature, also, includes, case, reports, of, the, recovery, of, a, small, number, of, patients, following, the, removal, of, assisted, respiration, with, cold, oxygen, the, researchers, found, that, in, many, nursing, homes, and, hospitals, unheated, oxygen, is, given, to, non, responsive, patients, via, tracheal, intubation, this, bypasses, the, warming, of, the, upper, respiratory, tract, and, causes, a, chilling, of, aortic, blood, and, chilling, of, the, brain, which, the, authors, believe, may, contribute, to, the, person, s, nonresponsive, state, the, researchers, describe, a, small, number, of, cases, in, which, removal, of, the, chilled, oxygen, was, followed, by, recovery, from, the, pvs, and, recommend, either, warming, of, oxygen, with, a, heated, nebulizer, or, removal, of, the, assisted, oxygen, if, it, is, no, longer, needed, the, authors, further, recommend, additional, research, to, determine, if, this, chilling, effect, may, either, delay, recovery, or, even, may, contribute, to, brain, damage, there, are, two, dimensions, of, recovery, from, a, persistent, vegetative, state, recovery, of, consciousness, and, recovery, of, function, recovery, of, consciousness, can, be, verified, by, reliable, evidence, of, awareness, of, self, and, the, environment, consistent, voluntary, behavioral, responses, to, visual, and, auditory, stimuli, and, interaction, with, others, recovery, of, function, is, characterized, by, communication, the, ability, to, learn, and, to, perform, adaptive, tasks, mobility, self, care, and, participation, in, recreational, or, vocational, activities, recovery, of, consciousness, may, occur, without, functional, recovery, but, functional, recovery, cannot, occur, without, recovery, of, consciousness, there, are, three, main, causes, of, pvs, persistent, vegetative, state, potential, causes, of, pvs, are, in, addition, these, authors, claim, that, doctors, sometimes, use, the, mnemonic, device, aeiou, tips, to, recall, portions, of, the, differential, diagnosis, alcohol, ingestion, and, acidosis, epilepsy, and, encephalopathy, infection, opiates, uremia, trauma, insulin, overdose, or, inflammatory, disorders, poisoning, and, psychogenic, causes, and, shock, despite, converging, agreement, about, the, definition, of, persistent, vegetative, state, recent, reports, have, raised, concerns, about, the, accuracy, of, diagnosis, in, some, patients, and, the, extent, to, which, in, a, selection, of, cases, residual, cognitive, functions, may, remain, undetected, and, patients, are, diagnosed, as, being, in, a, persistent, vegetative, state, objective, assessment, of, residual, cognitive, function, can, be, extremely, difficult, as, motor, responses, may, be, minimal, inconsistent, and, difficult, to, document, in, many, patients, or, may, be, undetectable, in, others, because, no, cognitive, output, is, possible, in, recent, years, a, number, of, studies, have, demonstrated, an, important, role, for, functional, neuroimaging, in, the, identification, of, residual, cognitive, function, in, persistent, vegetative, state, this, technology, is, providing, new, insights, into, cerebral, activity, in, patients, with, severe, brain, damage, such, studies, when, successful, may, be, particularly, useful, where, there, is, concern, about, the, accuracy, of, the, diagnosis, and, the, possibility, that, residual, cognitive, function, has, remained, undetected, researchers, have, begun, to, use, functional, neuroimaging, studies, to, study, implicit, cognitive, processing, in, patients, with, a, clinical, diagnosis, of, persistent, vegetative, state, activations, in, response, to, sensory, stimuli, with, positron, emission, tomography, pet, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, and, electrophysiological, methods, can, provide, information, on, the, presence, degree, and, location, of, any, residual, brain, function, however, use, of, these, techniques, in, people, with, severe, brain, damage, is, methodologically, clinically, and, theoretically, complex, and, needs, careful, quantitative, analysis, and, interpretation, for, example, pet, studies, have, shown, the, identification, of, residual, cognitive, function, in, persistent, vegetative, state, that, is, an, external, stimulation, such, as, a, painful, stimulus, still, activates, primary, sensory, cortices, in, these, patients, but, these, areas, are, functionally, disconnected, from, higher, order, associative, areas, needed, for, awareness, these, results, show, that, parts, of, the, cortex, are, indeed, still, functioning, in, vegetative, patients, in, addition, other, pet, studies, have, revealed, preserved, and, consistent, responses, in, predicted, regions, of, auditory, cortex, in, response, to, intelligible, speech, stimuli, moreover, a, preliminary, fmri, examination, revealed, partially, intact, responses, to, semantically, ambiguous, stimuli, which, are, known, to, tap, higher, aspects, of, speech, comprehension, furthermore, several, studies, have, used, pet, to, assess, the, central, processing, of, noxious, somatosensory, stimuli, in, patients, in, pvs, noxious, somatosensory, stimulation, activated, midbrain, contralateral, thalamus, and, primary, somatosensory, cortex, in, each, and, every, pvs, patient, even, in, the, absence, of, detectable, cortical, evoked, potentials, in, conclusion, somatosensory, stimulation, of, pvs, patients, at, intensities, that, elicited, pain, in, controls, resulted, in, increased, neuronal, activity, in, primary, somatosensory, cortex, even, if, resting, brain, metabolism, was, severely, impaired, however, this, activation, of, primary, cortex, seems, to, be, isolated, and, dissociated, from, higher, order, associative, cortices, also, there, is, evidence, of, partially, functional, cerebral, regions, in, catastrophically, injured, brains, to, study, five, patients, in, pvs, with, different, behavioral, features, researchers, employed, pet, mri, and, magnetoencephalographic, meg, responses, to, sensory, stimulation, in, three, of, the, five, patients, co, registered, pet, mri, correlate, areas, of, relatively, preserved, brain, metabolism, with, isolated, fragments, of, behavior, two, patients, had, had, anoxic, injuries, and, demonstrated, marked, decreases, in, overall, cerebral, metabolism, to, 30, 40, of, normal, two, other, patients, with, non, anoxic, multifocal, brain, injuries, demonstrated, several, isolated, brain, regions, with, higher, metabolic, rates, that, ranged, up, to, 50, 80, of, normal, nevertheless, their, global, metabolic, rates, remained, 50, of, normal, meg, recordings, from, three, pvs, patients, provide, clear, evidence, for, the, absence, abnormality, or, reduction, of, evoked, responses, despite, major, abnormalities, however, these, data, also, provide, evidence, for, localized, residual, activity, at, the, cortical, level, each, patient, partially, preserved, restricted, sensory, representations, as, evidenced, by, slow, evoked, magnetic, fields, and, gamma, band, activity, in, two, patients, these, activations, correlate, with, isolated, behavioral, patterns, and, metabolic, activity, remaining, active, regions, identified, in, the, three, pvs, patients, with, behavioral, fragments, appear, to, consist, of, segregated, corticothalamic, networks, that, retain, connectivity, and, partial, functional, integrity, a, single, patient, who, sustained, severe, injury, to, the, tegmental, mesencephalon, and, paramedian, thalamus, showed, widely, preserved, cortical, metabolism, and, a, global, average, metabolic, rate, of, 65, of, normal, the, relatively, high, preservation, of, cortical, metabolism, in, this, patient, defines, the, first, functional, correlate, of, clinical, pathological, reports, associating, permanent, unconsciousness, with, structural, damage, to, these, regions, the, specific, patterns, of, preserved, metabolic, activity, identified, in, these, patients, reflect, novel, evidence, of, the, modular, nature, of, individual, functional, networks, that, underlie, conscious, brain, function, the, variations, in, cerebral, metabolism, in, chronic, pvs, patients, indicate, that, some, cerebral, regions, can, retain, partial, function, in, catastrophically, injured, brains, statistical, pvs, misdiagnosis, is, common, an, example, study, with, 40, patients, in, the, united, kingdom, diagnosed, with, pvs, reported, 43, of, the, patients, were, considered, to, have, been, misdiagnosed, and, another, 33, had, recovered, whilst, the, study, was, underway, some, pvs, cases, may, actually, be, a, misdiagnosis, of, patients, being, in, an, undiagnosed, minimally, conscious, state, since, the, exact, diagnostic, criteria, of, the, minimally, conscious, state, were, only, formulated, in, 2002, there, may, be, chronic, patients, diagnosed, as, pvs, before, the, secondary, notion, of, the, minimally, conscious, state, became, known, whether, or, not, there, is, any, conscious, awareness, with, a, patient, s, vegetative, state, is, a, prominent, issue, three, completely, different, aspects, of, this, should, be, distinguished, first, some, patients, can, be, conscious, simply, because, they, are, misdiagnosed, see, above, in, fact, they, are, not, in, vegetative, states, second, sometimes, a, patient, was, correctly, diagnosed, but, is, then, examined, during, the, early, stages, of, recovery, third, perhaps, some, day, the, notion, itself, of, vegetative, states, will, change, so, to, include, elements, of, conscious, awareness, inability, to, disentangle, these, three, example, cases, causes, confusion, an, example, of, such, confusion, is, the, response, to, an, experiment, using, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, which, revealed, that, a, woman, diagnosed, with, pvs, was, able, to, activate, predictable, portions, of, her, brain, in, response, to, the, tester, s, requests, that, she, imagine, herself, playing, tennis, or, moving, from, room, to, room, in, her, house, the, brain, activity, in, response, to, these, instructions, was, indistinguishable, from, those, of, healthy, patients, in, 2010, martin, monti, and, fellow, researchers, working, at, the, mrc, cognition, and, brain, sciences, unit, at, the, university, of, cambridge, reported, in, an, article, in, the, new, england, journal, of, medicine, that, some, patients, in, persistent, vegetative, states, responded, to, verbal, instructions, by, displaying, different, patterns, of, brain, activity, on, fmri, scans, five, out, of, a, total, of, 54, diagnosed, patients, were, apparently, able, to, respond, when, instructed, to, think, about, one, of, two, different, physical, activities, one, of, these, five, was, also, able, to, answer, yes, or, no, questions, again, by, imagining, one, of, these, two, activities, it, is, unclear, however, whether, the, fact, that, portions, of, the, patients, brains, light, up, on, fmri, could, help, these, patients, assume, their, own, medical, decision, making, in, november, 2011, a, publication, in, the, lancet, presented, bedside, eeg, apparatus, and, indicated, that, its, signal, could, be, used, to, detect, awareness, in, three, of, 16, patients, diagnosed, in, the, vegetative, state, currently, no, treatment, for, vegetative, state, exists, that, would, satisfy, the, efficacy, criteria, of, evidence, based, medicine, several, methods, have, been, proposed, which, can, roughly, be, subdivided, into, four, categories, pharmacological, methods, surgery, physical, therapy, and, various, stimulation, techniques, pharmacological, therapy, mainly, uses, activating, substances, such, as, tricyclic, antidepressants, or, methylphenidate, mixed, results, have, been, reported, using, dopaminergic, drugs, such, as, amantadine, and, bromocriptine, and, stimulants, such, as, dextroamphetamine, surgical, methods, such, as, deep, brain, stimulation, are, used, less, frequently, due, to, the, invasiveness, of, the, procedures, stimulation, techniques, include, sensory, stimulation, sensory, regulation, music, and, musicokinetic, therapy, social, tactile, interaction, and, cortical, stimulation, there, is, limited, evidence, that, the, hypnotic, drug, zolpidem, has, an, effect, the, results, of, the, few, scientific, studies, that, have, been, published, so, far, on, the, effectiveness, of, zolpidem, have, been, contradictory, in, the, united, states, it, is, estimated, that, there, may, be, between, 15, 000, and, 40, 000, patients, who, are, in, a, persistent, vegetative, state, but, due, to, poor, nursing, home, records, exact, figures, are, hard, to, determine, the, syndrome, was, first, described, in, 1940, by, ernst, kretschmer, who, called, it, apallic, syndrome, the, term, persistent, vegetative, state, was, coined, in, 1972, by, scottish, spinal, surgeon, bryan, jennett, and, american, neurologist, fred, plum, to, describe, a, syndrome, that, seemed, to, have, been, made, possible, by, medicine, s, increased, capacities, to, keep, patients, bodies, alive, an, ongoing, debate, exists, as, to, how, much, care, if, any, patients, in, a, persistent, vegetative, state, should, receive, in, health, systems, plagued, by, limited, resources, in, a, case, before, the, new, jersey, superior, court, betancourt, v, trinitas, hospital, a, community, hospital, sought, a, ruling, that, dialysis, and, cpr, for, such, a, patient, constitutes, futile, care, an, american, bioethicist, jacob, m, appel, argued, that, any, money, spent, treating, pvs, patients, would, be, better, spent, on, other, patients, with, a, higher, likelihood, of, recovery, the, patient, died, naturally, prior, to, a, decision, in, the, case, resulting, in, the, court, finding, the, issue, moot, in, 2010, british, and, belgian, researchers, reported, in, an, article, in, the, new, england, journal, of, medicine, that, some, patients, in, persistent, vegetative, states, actually, had, enough, consciousness, to, answer, yes, or, no, questions, on, fmri, scans, however, it, is, unclear, whether, the, fact, that, portions, of, the, patients, brains, light, up, on, fmri, will, help, these, patient, assume, their, own, medical, decision, making, professor, geraint, rees, director, of, the, institute, of, cognitive, neuroscience, at, university, college, london, responded, to, the, study, by, observing, that, as, a, clinician, it, would, be, important, to, satisfy, oneself, that, the, individual, that, you, are, communicating, with, is, competent, to, make, those, decisions, at, the, moment, it, is, premature, to, conclude, that, the, individual, able, to, answer, 5, out, of, 6, yes, no, questions, is, fully, conscious, like, you, or, i, in, contrast, jacob, m, appel, of, the, mount, sinai, hospital, told, the, telegraph, that, this, development, could, be, a, welcome, step, toward, clarifying, the, wishes, of, such, patients, appel, stated, i, see, no, reason, why, if, we, are, truly, convinced, such, patients, are, communicating, society, should, not, honour, their, wishes, in, fact, as, a, physician, i, think, a, compelling, case, can, be, made, that, doctors, have, an, ethical, obligation, to, assist, such, patients, by, removing, treatment, i, suspect, that, if, such, individuals, are, indeed, trapped, in, their, bodies, they, may, be, living, in, great, torment, and, will, request, to, have, their, care, terminated, or, even, active, euthanasia, this, article, contains, text, from, the, ninds, public,
