an, alligator, or, colloquially, gator, is, a, large, reptile, in, the, genus, alligator, of, the, family, alligatoridae, of, the, order, crocodilia, the, two, extant, species, are, the, american, alligator, a, mississippiensis, and, the, chinese, alligator, a, sinensis, additionally, several, extinct, species, of, alligator, are, known, from, fossil, remains, alligators, first, appeared, during, the, late, eocene, epoch, about, 37, million, years, ago, the, name, alligator, is, likely, an, anglicized, form, of, el, lagarto, the, spanish, term, for, the, lizard, which, early, spanish, explorers, and, settlers, in, florida, called, the, alligator, early, english, spellings, of, the, name, included, allagarta, and, alagarto, alligators, and, caimans, split, in, north, america, during, the, early, tertiary, or, late, cretaceous, about, 53, million, to, about, 65, million, years, ago, the, chinese, alligator, split, from, the, american, alligator, about, 33, million, years, ago, and, probably, descended, from, a, lineage, that, crossed, the, bering, land, bridge, during, the, neogene, the, modern, american, alligator, is, well, represented, in, the, fossil, record, of, the, pleistocene, the, alligator, s, full, mitochondrial, genome, was, sequenced, in, the, 1990s, the, full, genome, published, in, 2014, suggests, that, the, alligator, evolved, much, more, slowly, than, mammals, and, birds, the, genus, alligator, belongs, to, the, subfamily, alligatorinae, which, is, the, sister, taxon, to, caimaninae, the, caimans, together, these, two, subfamilies, form, the, family, alligatoridae, the, cladogram, below, shows, the, phylogeny, of, alligators, caimaninae, ceratosuchus, burdoshi, hassiacosuchus, haupti, navajosuchus, mooki, wannaganosuchus, brachymanus, arambourgia, gaudryi, allognathosuchus, polyodon, allognathosuchus, wartheni, procaimanoidea, kayi, alligator, prenasalis, alligator, mcgrewi, alligator, olseni, alligator, sinensis, chinese, alligator, alligator, thomsoni, alligator, mefferdi, alligator, mississippiensis, american, alligator, an, average, adult, american, alligator, s, weight, and, length, is, 360, kg, 790, lb, and, 4, m, 13, ft, but, they, sometimes, grow, to, 4, 4, m, 14, ft, long, and, weigh, over, 450, kg, 990, lb, the, largest, ever, recorded, found, in, louisiana, measured, 5, 84, m, 19, 2, ft, the, chinese, alligator, is, smaller, rarely, exceeding, 2, 1, m, 7, ft, in, length, additionally, it, weighs, considerably, less, with, males, rarely, over, 45, kg, 100, lb, adult, alligators, are, black, or, dark, olive, brown, with, white, undersides, while, juveniles, have, bright, yellow, or, whitish, stripes, which, sharply, contrast, against, their, dark, hides, providing, them, additional, camouflage, amongst, reeds, and, wetland, grasses, no, average, lifespan, for, an, alligator, has, been, measured, one, of, the, oldest, recorded, alligator, lives, was, that, of, saturn, an, american, alligator, who, was, hatched, in, 1936, in, mississippi, and, spent, nearly, a, decade, in, germany, before, spending, the, majority, of, his, life, at, the, moscow, zoo, where, he, died, at, the, age, of, 83, or, 84, on, 22, may, 2020, another, one, of, the, oldest, lives, on, record, is, that, of, muja, an, american, alligator, who, was, brought, as, an, adult, specimen, to, the, belgrade, zoo, in, serbia, from, germany, in, 1937, although, no, valid, records, exist, about, his, date, of, birth, as, of, 2012, he, was, in, his, 80s, and, possibly, the, oldest, alligator, living, in, captivity, alligators, are, native, only, to, the, united, states, and, china, american, alligators, are, found, in, the, southeast, united, states, all, of, florida, and, louisiana, the, southern, parts, of, georgia, alabama, and, mississippi, coastal, south, and, north, carolina, east, texas, the, southeast, corner, of, oklahoma, and, the, southern, tip, of, arkansas, louisiana, has, the, largest, alligator, population, the, majority, of, american, alligators, inhabit, florida, and, louisiana, with, over, a, million, alligators, in, each, state, southern, florida, is, the, only, place, where, both, alligators, and, crocodiles, live, side, by, side, american, alligators, live, in, freshwater, environments, such, as, ponds, marshes, wetlands, rivers, lakes, and, swamps, as, well, as, in, brackish, water, when, they, construct, alligator, holes, in, the, wetlands, they, increase, plant, diversity, and, provide, habitat, for, other, animals, during, droughts, they, are, therefore, considered, an, important, species, for, maintaining, ecological, diversity, in, wetlands, farther, west, in, louisiana, heavy, grazing, by, nutrias, and, muskrats, is, causing, severe, damage, to, coastal, wetlands, large, alligators, feed, extensively, on, nutrias, and, provide, a, vital, ecological, service, by, reducing, nutria, numbers, the, chinese, alligator, currently, is, found, in, only, the, yangtze, river, valley, and, parts, of, adjacent, provinces, and, is, extremely, endangered, with, only, a, few, dozen, believed, to, be, left, in, the, wild, far, more, chinese, alligators, live, in, zoos, around, the, world, than, can, be, found, in, the, wild, rockefeller, wildlife, refuge, in, southern, louisiana, has, several, in, captivity, in, an, attempt, to, preserve, the, species, miami, metrozoo, in, florida, also, has, a, breeding, pair, of, chinese, alligators, large, male, alligators, are, solitary, territorial, animals, smaller, alligators, can, often, be, found, in, large, numbers, close, to, each, other, the, largest, of, the, species, both, males, and, females, defend, prime, territory, smaller, alligators, have, a, higher, tolerance, for, other, alligators, within, a, similar, size, class, alligators, move, on, land, by, two, forms, of, locomotion, referred, to, as, sprawl, and, high, walk, the, sprawl, is, a, forward, movement, with, the, belly, making, contact, with, the, ground, and, is, used, to, transition, to, high, walk, or, to, slither, over, wet, substrate, into, water, the, high, walk, is, an, up, on, four, limbs, forward, motion, used, for, overland, travel, with, the, belly, well, up, from, the, ground, alligators, have, also, been, observed, to, rise, up, and, balance, on, their, hind, legs, and, semi, step, forward, as, part, of, a, forward, or, upward, lunge, however, they, can, not, walk, on, their, hind, legs, although, the, alligator, has, a, heavy, body, and, a, slow, metabolism, it, is, capable, of, short, bursts, of, speed, especially, in, very, short, lunges, alligators, main, prey, are, smaller, animals, they, can, kill, and, eat, with, a, single, bite, they, may, kill, larger, prey, by, grabbing, it, and, dragging, it, into, the, water, to, drown, alligators, consume, food, that, cannot, be, eaten, in, one, bite, by, allowing, it, to, rot, or, by, biting, and, then, performing, a, death, roll, spinning, or, convulsing, wildly, until, bite, sized, chunks, are, torn, off, critical, to, the, alligator, s, ability, to, initiate, a, death, roll, the, tail, must, flex, to, a, significant, angle, relative, to, its, body, an, alligator, with, an, immobilized, tail, cannot, perform, a, death, roll, most, of, the, muscle, in, an, alligator, s, jaw, evolved, to, bite, and, grip, prey, the, muscles, that, close, the, jaws, are, powerful, but, the, muscles, for, opening, their, jaws, are, weak, as, a, result, an, adult, human, can, hold, an, alligator, s, jaws, shut, bare, handed, it, is, common, to, use, several, wraps, of, duct, tape, to, prevent, an, adult, alligator, from, opening, its, jaws, when, being, handled, or, transported, alligators, are, generally, timid, towards, humans, and, tend, to, walk, or, swim, away, if, one, approaches, this, may, encourage, people, to, approach, alligators, and, their, nests, which, can, provoke, the, animals, into, attacking, in, florida, feeding, wild, alligators, at, any, time, is, illegal, if, fed, the, alligators, will, eventually, lose, their, fear, of, humans, and, will, learn, to, associate, humans, with, food, the, type, of, food, eaten, by, alligators, depends, upon, their, age, and, size, when, young, alligators, eat, fish, insects, snails, crustaceans, and, worms, as, they, mature, progressively, larger, prey, is, taken, including, larger, fish, such, as, gar, turtles, and, various, mammals, particularly, nutrias, and, muskrats, as, well, as, birds, deer, and, other, reptiles, their, stomachs, also, often, contain, gizzard, stones, they, will, even, consume, carrion, if, they, are, sufficiently, hungry, in, some, cases, larger, alligators, are, known, to, ambush, dogs, florida, panthers, and, black, bears, making, them, the, apex, predator, throughout, their, distribution, in, this, role, as, a, top, predator, it, may, determine, the, abundance, of, prey, species, including, turtles, and, nutrias, as, humans, encroach, into, their, habitat, attacks, are, few, but, not, unknown, alligators, unlike, the, large, crocodiles, do, not, immediately, regard, a, human, upon, encounter, as, prey, but, may, still, attack, in, self, defense, if, provoked, alligators, generally, mature, at, a, length, of, 1, 8, m, 6, ft, the, mating, season, is, in, late, spring, in, april, and, may, alligators, form, so, called, bellowing, choruses, large, groups, of, animals, bellow, together, for, a, few, minutes, a, few, times, a, day, usually, one, to, three, hours, after, sunrise, the, bellows, of, male, american, alligators, are, accompanied, by, powerful, blasts, of, infrasound, another, form, of, male, display, is, a, loud, head, slap, in, 2010, on, spring, nights, alligators, were, found, to, gather, in, large, numbers, for, group, courtship, the, so, called, alligator, dances, in, summer, the, female, builds, a, nest, of, vegetation, where, the, decomposition, of, the, vegetation, provides, the, heat, needed, to, incubate, the, eggs, the, sex, of, the, offspring, is, determined, by, the, temperature, in, the, nest, and, is, fixed, within, seven, to, 21, days, of, the, start, of, incubation, incubation, temperatures, of, 30, c, 86, f, or, lower, produce, a, clutch, of, females, those, of, 34, c, 93, f, or, higher, produce, entirely, males, nests, constructed, on, leaves, are, hotter, than, those, constructed, on, wet, marsh, so, the, former, tend, to, produce, males, and, the, latter, females, the, baby, alligator, s, egg, tooth, helps, it, get, out, of, its, egg, during, hatching, time, the, natural, sex, ratio, at, hatching, is, five, females, to, one, male, females, hatched, from, eggs, incubated, at, 30, c, 86, f, weigh, significantly, more, than, males, hatched, from, eggs, incubated, at, 34, c, 93, f, the, mother, defends, the, nest, from, predators, and, assists, the, hatchlings, to, water, she, will, provide, protection, to, the, young, for, about, a, year, if, they, remain, in, the, area, adult, alligators, regularly, cannibalize, younger, individuals, though, estimates, of, the, rate, of, cannibalism, vary, widely, in, the, past, immediately, following, the, outlawing, of, alligator, hunting, populations, rebounded, quickly, due, to, the, suppressed, number, of, adults, preying, upon, juveniles, increasing, survival, among, the, young, alligators, alligators, much, like, birds, have, been, shown, to, exhibit, unidirectional, movement, of, air, through, their, lungs, most, other, amniotes, are, believed, to, exhibit, bidirectional, or, tidal, breathing, for, a, tidal, breathing, animal, such, as, a, mammal, air, flows, into, and, out, of, the, lungs, through, branching, bronchi, which, terminate, in, small, dead, end, chambers, called, alveoli, as, the, alveoli, represent, dead, ends, to, flow, the, inspired, air, must, move, back, out, the, same, way, it, came, in, in, contrast, air, in, alligator, lungs, makes, a, circuit, moving, in, only, one, direction, through, the, parabronchi, the, air, first, enters, the, outer, branch, moves, through, the, parabronchi, and, exits, the, lung, through, the, inner, branch, oxygen, exchange, takes, place, in, extensive, vasculature, around, the, parabronchi, the, alligator, has, a, similar, digestive, system, to, that, of, the, crocodile, with, minor, differences, in, morphology, and, enzyme, activity, alligators, have, a, two, part, stomach, with, the, first, smaller, portion, containing, gastroliths, it, is, believed, this, portion, of, the, stomach, serves, a, similar, function, as, it, does, in, the, gizzard, of, some, species, of, birds, to, aid, in, digestion, the, gastroliths, work, to, grind, up, the, meal, as, alligators, will, take, large, bites, or, swallow, smaller, prey, whole, this, process, makes, digestion, and, nutrient, absorption, easier, once, the, food, reaches, the, second, portion, of, the, stomach, once, an, alligator, s, meal, has, been, processed, it, will, move, on, to, the, second, portion, of, the, stomach, which, is, highly, acidic, the, acidity, of, the, stomach, has, been, observed, to, increase, once, digestion, begins, this, is, due, to, the, increase, in, co, 2, concentration, of, the, blood, resulting, from, the, right, to, left, shunting, of, the, alligators, heart, the, right, to, left, shunt, of, the, heart, in, alligators, means, the, circulatory, system, will, recirculate, blood, through, the, body, instead, of, back, to, the, lungs, the, re, circulation, of, blood, leads, to, higher, co, 2, concentration, as, well, as, lower, oxygen, affinity, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, that, there, is, increased, blood, flow, diverted, to, the, stomach, during, digestion, to, facilitate, an, increase, in, co, 2, concentration, which, aids, in, increasing, gastric, acid, secretions, during, digestion, the, alligator, s, metabolism, will, also, increase, after, a, meal, by, up, to, four, times, its, basal, metabolic, rate, alligators, also, have, highly, folded, mucosa, in, the, lining, of, the, intestines, to, further, aid, in, the, absorption, of, nutrients, the, folds, result, in, greater, surface, area, for, the, nutrients, to, be, absorbed, through, alligators, also, have, complex, microbiomes, that, are, not, fully, understood, yet, but, can, be, attributed, to, both, benefits, and, costs, to, the, animal, these, microorganisms, can, be, found, in, the, high, surface, area, of, the, mucosa, folds, of, the, intestines, as, well, as, throughout, the, digestive, tract, benefits, include, better, total, health, and, stronger, immune, system, however, alligators, are, still, vulnerable, to, microbial, infections, despite, the, immune, boost, from, other, microbiota, during, brumation, the, process, of, digestion, experiences, changes, due, to, the, fasting, most, alligators, experience, during, these, periods, of, inactivity, alligators, that, go, long, enough, without, a, meal, during, brumation, will, begin, a, process, called, autophagy, where, the, animal, begins, to, consume, its, fat, reserves, to, maintain, its, body, weight, until, it, can, acquire, a, sufficient, meal, there, is, also, fluctuation, in, the, level, of, bacterial, taxa, populations, in, the, alligator, s, microbial, community, between, seasons, which, helps, the, alligator, cope, with, different, rates, of, feeding, and, activity, like, other, crocodilians, alligators, have, an, armor, of, bony, scutes, the, dermal, bones, are, highly, vascularised, and, aid, in, calcium, balance, both, to, neutralize, acids, while, the, animal, cannot, breathe, underwater, and, to, provide, calcium, for, eggshell, formation, alligators, have, muscular, flat, tails, that, propel, them, while, swimming, the, two, kinds, of, white, alligators, are, albino, and, leucistic, these, alligators, are, practically, impossible, to, find, in, the, wild, they, could, survive, only, in, captivity, and, are, few, in, number, the, aquarium, of, the, americas, in, new, orleans, has, leucistic, alligators, found, in, a, louisiana, swamp, in, 1987, alligators, are, raised, commercially, for, their, meat, and, their, skin, which, when, tanned, is, used, for, the, manufacture, of, luggage, handbags, shoes, belts, and, other, leather, items, alligators, also, provide, economic, benefits, through, the, ecotourism, industry, visitors, may, take, swamp, tours, in, which, alligators, are, a, feature, their, most, important, economic, benefit, to, humans, may, be, the, control, of, nutrias, and, muskrats, alligator, meat, is, also, consumed, by, humans, while, there, are, rules, of, thumb, for, distinguishing, alligators, from, crocodiles, all, of, them, admit, exceptions, such, general, rules, include
