benzodiazepines, bzd, bdz, bzs, colloquially, called, benzos, are, a, class, of, depressant, drugs, whose, core, chemical, structure, is, the, fusion, of, a, benzene, ring, and, a, diazepine, ring, they, are, prescribed, to, treat, conditions, such, as, anxiety, disorders, insomnia, and, seizures, the, first, benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide, librium, was, discovered, accidentally, by, leo, sternbach, in, 1955, and, was, made, available, in, 1960, by, hoffmann, la, roche, which, followed, with, the, development, of, diazepam, valium, three, years, later, in, 1963, by, 1977, benzodiazepines, were, the, most, prescribed, medications, globally, the, introduction, of, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitors, ssris, among, other, factors, decreased, rates, of, prescription, but, they, remain, frequently, used, worldwide, benzodiazepines, are, depressants, that, enhance, the, effect, of, the, neurotransmitter, gamma, aminobutyric, acid, gaba, at, the, gaba, a, receptor, resulting, in, sedative, hypnotic, sleep, inducing, anxiolytic, anti, anxiety, anticonvulsant, and, muscle, relaxant, properties, high, doses, of, many, shorter, acting, benzodiazepines, may, also, cause, anterograde, amnesia, and, dissociation, these, properties, make, benzodiazepines, useful, in, treating, anxiety, panic, disorder, insomnia, agitation, seizures, muscle, spasms, alcohol, withdrawal, and, as, a, premedication, for, medical, or, dental, procedures, benzodiazepines, are, categorized, as, short, intermediate, or, long, acting, short, and, intermediate, acting, benzodiazepines, are, preferred, for, the, treatment, of, insomnia, longer, acting, benzodiazepines, are, recommended, for, the, treatment, of, anxiety, benzodiazepines, are, generally, viewed, as, safe, and, effective, for, short, term, use, of, two, to, four, weeks, although, cognitive, impairment, and, paradoxical, effects, such, as, aggression, or, behavioral, disinhibition, can, occur, according, to, the, government, of, victoria, s, australia, department, of, health, long, term, use, can, cause, impaired, thinking, or, memory, loss, anxiety, and, depression, irritability, paranoia, aggression, etc, a, minority, of, people, have, paradoxical, reactions, after, taking, benzodiazepines, such, as, worsened, agitation, or, panic, benzodiazepines, are, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, suicide, due, to, aggression, impulsivity, and, negative, withdrawal, effects, long, term, use, is, controversial, because, of, concerns, about, decreasing, effectiveness, physical, dependence, benzodiazepine, withdrawal, syndrome, and, an, increased, risk, of, dementia, and, cancer, the, elderly, are, at, an, increased, risk, of, both, short, and, long, term, adverse, effects, and, as, a, result, all, benzodiazepines, are, listed, in, the, beers, list, of, inappropriate, medications, for, older, adults, there, is, controversy, concerning, the, safety, of, benzodiazepines, in, pregnancy, while, they, are, not, major, teratogens, uncertainty, remains, as, to, whether, they, cause, cleft, palate, in, a, small, number, of, babies, and, whether, neurobehavioural, effects, occur, as, a, result, of, prenatal, exposure, they, are, known, to, cause, withdrawal, symptoms, in, the, newborn, in, an, overdose, benzodiazepines, can, cause, dangerous, deep, unconsciousness, but, are, less, toxic, than, their, predecessors, the, barbiturates, and, death, rarely, results, when, a, benzodiazepine, is, the, only, drug, taken, combined, with, other, central, nervous, system, cns, depressants, such, as, alcohol, and, opioids, the, potential, for, toxicity, and, fatal, overdose, increases, significantly, benzodiazepines, are, commonly, used, recreationally, and, also, often, taken, in, combination, with, other, addictive, substances, and, are, controlled, in, most, countries, benzodiazepines, possess, psycholeptic, sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle, relaxant, and, amnesic, actions, which, are, useful, in, a, variety, of, indications, such, as, alcohol, dependence, seizures, anxiety, disorders, panic, agitation, and, insomnia, most, are, administered, orally, however, they, can, also, be, given, intravenously, intramuscularly, or, rectally, 189, in, general, benzodiazepines, are, well, tolerated, and, are, safe, and, effective, drugs, in, the, short, term, for, a, wide, range, of, conditions, tolerance, can, develop, to, their, effects, and, there, is, also, a, risk, of, dependence, and, upon, discontinuation, a, withdrawal, syndrome, may, occur, these, factors, combined, with, other, possible, secondary, effects, after, prolonged, use, such, as, psychomotor, cognitive, or, memory, impairments, limit, their, long, term, applicability, the, effects, of, long, term, use, or, misuse, include, the, tendency, to, cause, or, worsen, cognitive, deficits, depression, and, anxiety, the, college, of, physicians, and, surgeons, of, british, columbia, recommends, discontinuing, the, usage, of, benzodiazepines, in, those, on, opioids, and, those, who, have, used, them, long, term, benzodiazepines, can, have, serious, adverse, health, outcomes, and, these, findings, support, clinical, and, regulatory, efforts, to, reduce, usage, especially, in, combination, with, non, benzodiazepine, receptor, agonists, because, of, their, effectiveness, tolerability, and, rapid, onset, of, anxiolytic, action, benzodiazepines, are, frequently, used, for, the, treatment, of, anxiety, associated, with, panic, disorder, however, there, is, disagreement, among, expert, bodies, regarding, the, long, term, use, of, benzodiazepines, for, panic, disorder, the, views, range, from, those, holding, benzodiazepines, are, not, effective, long, term, and, should, be, reserved, for, treatment, resistant, cases, to, those, holding, they, are, as, effective, in, the, long, term, as, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitors, ssris, american, psychiatric, association, apa, guidelines, published, in, january, 2009, note, that, in, general, benzodiazepines, are, well, tolerated, and, their, use, for, the, initial, treatment, for, panic, disorder, is, strongly, supported, by, numerous, controlled, trials, apa, states, that, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, recommend, any, of, the, established, panic, disorder, treatments, over, another, the, choice, of, treatment, between, benzodiazepines, ssris, serotonin, norepinephrine, reuptake, inhibitors, snris, tricyclic, antidepressants, and, psychotherapy, should, be, based, on, the, patient, s, history, preference, and, other, individual, characteristics, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitors, are, likely, to, be, the, best, choice, of, pharmacotherapy, for, many, patients, with, panic, disorder, but, benzodiazepines, are, also, often, used, and, some, studies, suggest, that, these, medications, are, still, used, with, greater, frequency, than, the, ssris, one, advantage, of, benzodiazepines, is, that, they, alleviate, the, anxiety, symptoms, much, faster, than, antidepressants, and, therefore, may, be, preferred, in, patients, for, whom, rapid, symptom, control, is, critical, however, this, advantage, is, offset, by, the, possibility, of, developing, benzodiazepine, dependence, apa, does, not, recommend, benzodiazepines, for, persons, with, depressive, symptoms, or, a, recent, history, of, substance, use, disorder, apa, guidelines, state, that, in, general, pharmacotherapy, of, panic, disorder, should, be, continued, for, at, least, a, year, and, that, clinical, experience, supports, continuing, benzodiazepine, treatment, to, prevent, recurrence, although, major, concerns, about, benzodiazepine, tolerance, and, withdrawal, have, been, raised, there, is, no, evidence, for, significant, dose, escalation, in, patients, using, benzodiazepines, long, term, for, many, such, patients, stable, doses, of, benzodiazepines, retain, their, efficacy, over, several, years, guidelines, issued, by, the, uk, based, national, institute, for, health, and, clinical, excellence, nice, carried, out, a, systematic, review, using, different, methodology, and, came, to, a, different, conclusion, they, questioned, the, accuracy, of, studies, that, were, not, placebo, controlled, and, based, on, the, findings, of, placebo, controlled, studies, they, do, not, recommend, use, of, benzodiazepines, beyond, two, to, four, weeks, as, tolerance, and, physical, dependence, develop, rapidly, with, withdrawal, symptoms, including, rebound, anxiety, occurring, after, six, weeks, or, more, of, use, nevertheless, benzodiazepines, are, still, prescribed, for, long, term, treatment, of, anxiety, disorders, although, specific, antidepressants, and, psychological, therapies, are, recommended, as, the, first, line, treatment, options, with, the, anticonvulsant, drug, pregabalin, indicated, as, a, second, or, third, line, treatment, and, suitable, for, long, term, use, nice, stated, that, long, term, use, of, benzodiazepines, for, panic, disorder, with, or, without, agoraphobia, is, an, unlicensed, indication, does, not, have, long, term, efficacy, and, is, therefore, not, recommended, by, clinical, guidelines, psychological, therapies, such, as, cognitive, behavioural, therapy, are, recommended, as, a, first, line, therapy, for, panic, disorder, benzodiazepine, use, has, been, found, to, interfere, with, therapeutic, gains, from, these, therapies, benzodiazepines, are, usually, administered, orally, however, very, occasionally, lorazepam, or, diazepam, may, be, given, intravenously, for, the, treatment, of, panic, attacks, benzodiazepines, have, robust, efficacy, in, the, short, term, management, of, generalized, anxiety, disorder, gad, but, were, not, shown, effective, in, producing, long, term, improvement, overall, according, to, national, institute, for, health, and, clinical, excellence, nice, benzodiazepines, can, be, used, in, the, immediate, management, of, gad, if, necessary, however, they, should, not, usually, be, given, for, longer, than, 2, 4, weeks, the, only, medications, nice, recommends, for, the, longer, term, management, of, gad, are, antidepressants, likewise, canadian, psychiatric, association, cpa, recommends, benzodiazepines, alprazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam, and, diazepam, only, as, a, second, line, choice, if, the, treatment, with, two, different, antidepressants, was, unsuccessful, although, they, are, second, line, agents, benzodiazepines, can, be, used, for, a, limited, time, to, relieve, severe, anxiety, and, agitation, cpa, guidelines, note, that, after, 4, 6, weeks, the, effect, of, benzodiazepines, may, decrease, to, the, level, of, placebo, and, that, benzodiazepines, are, less, effective, than, antidepressants, in, alleviating, ruminative, worry, the, core, symptom, of, gad, however, in, some, cases, a, prolonged, treatment, with, benzodiazepines, as, the, add, on, to, an, antidepressant, may, be, justified, a, 2015, review, found, a, larger, effect, with, medications, than, talk, therapy, medications, with, benefit, include, serotonin, noradrenaline, reuptake, inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitors, benzodiazepines, are, sometimes, used, in, the, treatment, of, acute, anxiety, since, they, result, in, rapid, and, marked, relief, of, symptoms, in, most, individuals, however, they, are, not, recommended, beyond, 2, 4, weeks, of, use, due, to, risks, of, tolerance, and, dependence, and, a, lack, of, long, term, effectiveness, as, for, insomnia, they, may, also, be, used, on, an, irregular, as, needed, basis, such, as, in, cases, where, said, anxiety, is, at, its, worst, compared, to, other, pharmacological, treatments, benzodiazepines, are, twice, as, likely, to, lead, to, a, relapse, of, the, underlying, condition, upon, discontinuation, psychological, therapies, and, other, pharmacological, therapies, are, recommended, for, the, long, term, treatment, of, generalized, anxiety, disorder, antidepressants, have, higher, remission, rates, and, are, in, general, safe, and, effective, in, the, short, and, long, term, benzodiazepines, can, be, useful, for, short, term, treatment, of, insomnia, their, use, beyond, 2, to, 4, weeks, is, not, recommended, due, to, the, risk, of, dependence, the, committee, on, safety, of, medicines, report, recommended, that, where, long, term, use, of, benzodiazepines, for, insomnia, is, indicated, then, treatment, should, be, intermittent, wherever, possible, it, is, preferred, that, benzodiazepines, be, taken, intermittently, and, at, the, lowest, effective, dose, they, improve, sleep, related, problems, by, shortening, the, time, spent, in, bed, before, falling, asleep, prolonging, the, sleep, time, and, in, general, reducing, wakefulness, however, they, worsen, sleep, quality, by, increasing, light, sleep, and, decreasing, deep, sleep, other, drawbacks, of, hypnotics, including, benzodiazepines, are, possible, tolerance, to, their, effects, rebound, insomnia, and, reduced, slow, wave, sleep, and, a, withdrawal, period, typified, by, rebound, insomnia, and, a, prolonged, period, of, anxiety, and, agitation, the, list, of, benzodiazepines, approved, for, the, treatment, of, insomnia, is, fairly, similar, among, most, countries, but, which, benzodiazepines, are, officially, designated, as, first, line, hypnotics, prescribed, for, the, treatment, of, insomnia, varies, between, countries, longer, acting, benzodiazepines, such, as, nitrazepam, and, diazepam, have, residual, effects, that, may, persist, into, the, next, day, and, are, in, general, not, recommended, since, the, release, of, nonbenzodiazepines, also, known, as, z, drugs, in, 1992, in, response, to, safety, concerns, individuals, with, insomnia, and, other, sleep, disorders, have, increasingly, been, prescribed, nonbenzodiazepines, 2, 3, in, 1993, to, 13, 7, of, americans, in, 2010, less, often, prescribed, benzodiazepines, 23, 5, in, 1993, to, 10, 8, in, 2010, it, is, not, clear, as, to, whether, the, new, non, benzodiazepine, hypnotics, z, drugs, are, better, than, the, short, acting, benzodiazepines, the, efficacy, of, these, two, groups, of, medications, is, similar, according, to, the, us, agency, for, healthcare, research, and, quality, indirect, comparison, indicates, that, side, effects, from, benzodiazepines, may, be, about, twice, as, frequent, as, from, nonbenzodiazepines, some, experts, suggest, using, nonbenzodiazepines, preferentially, as, a, first, line, long, term, treatment, of, insomnia, however, the, uk, national, institute, for, health, and, clinical, excellence, did, not, find, any, convincing, evidence, in, favor, of, z, drugs, nice, review, pointed, out, that, short, acting, z, drugs, were, inappropriately, compared, in, clinical, trials, with, long, acting, benzodiazepines, there, have, been, no, trials, comparing, short, acting, z, drugs, with, appropriate, doses, of, short, acting, benzodiazepines, based, on, this, nice, recommended, choosing, the, hypnotic, based, on, cost, and, the, patient, s, preference, older, adults, should, not, use, benzodiazepines, to, treat, insomnia, unless, other, treatments, have, failed, when, benzodiazepines, are, used, patients, their, caretakers, and, their, physician, should, discuss, the, increased, risk, of, harms, including, evidence, that, shows, twice, the, incidence, of, traffic, collisions, among, driving, patients, and, falls, and, hip, fracture, for, older, patients, prolonged, convulsive, epileptic, seizures, are, a, medical, emergency, that, can, usually, be, dealt, with, effectively, by, administering, fast, acting, benzodiazepines, which, are, potent, anticonvulsants, in, a, hospital, environment, intravenous, clonazepam, lorazepam, and, diazepam, are, first, line, choices, in, the, community, intravenous, administration, is, not, practical, and, so, rectal, diazepam, or, buccal, midazolam, are, used, with, a, preference, for, midazolam, as, its, administration, is, easier, and, more, socially, acceptable, when, benzodiazepines, were, first, introduced, they, were, enthusiastically, adopted, for, treating, all, forms, of, epilepsy, however, drowsiness, and, tolerance, become, problems, with, continued, use, and, none, are, now, considered, first, line, choices, for, long, term, epilepsy, therapy, clobazam, is, widely, used, by, specialist, epilepsy, clinics, worldwide, and, clonazepam, is, popular, in, the, netherlands, belgium, and, france, clobazam, was, approved, for, use, in, the, united, states, in, 2011, in, the, uk, both, clobazam, and, clonazepam, are, second, line, choices, for, treating, many, forms, of, epilepsy, clobazam, also, has, a, useful, role, for, very, short, term, seizure, prophylaxis, and, in, catamenial, epilepsy, discontinuation, after, long, term, use, in, epilepsy, requires, additional, caution, because, of, the, risks, of, rebound, seizures, therefore, the, dose, is, slowly, tapered, over, a, period, of, up, to, six, months, or, longer, chlordiazepoxide, is, the, most, commonly, used, benzodiazepine, for, alcohol, detoxification, but, diazepam, may, be, used, as, an, alternative, both, are, used, in, the, detoxification, of, individuals, who, are, motivated, to, stop, drinking, and, are, prescribed, for, a, short, period, of, time, to, reduce, the, risks, of, developing, tolerance, and, dependence, to, the, benzodiazepine, medication, itself, 275, the, benzodiazepines, with, a, longer, half, life, make, detoxification, more, tolerable, and, dangerous, and, potentially, lethal, alcohol, withdrawal, effects, are, less, likely, to, occur, on, the, other, hand, short, acting, benzodiazepines, may, lead, to, breakthrough, seizures, and, are, therefore, not, recommended, for, detoxification, in, an, outpatient, setting, oxazepam, and, lorazepam, are, often, used, in, patients, at, risk, of, drug, accumulation, in, particular, the, elderly, and, those, with, cirrhosis, because, they, are, metabolized, differently, from, other, benzodiazepines, through, conjugation, benzodiazepines, are, the, preferred, choice, in, the, management, of, alcohol, withdrawal, syndrome, in, particular, for, the, prevention, and, treatment, of, the, dangerous, complication, of, seizures, and, in, subduing, severe, delirium, lorazepam, is, the, only, benzodiazepine, with, predictable, intramuscular, absorption, and, it, is, the, most, effective, in, preventing, and, controlling, acute, seizures, benzodiazepines, are, often, prescribed, for, a, wide, range, of, conditions, benzodiazepines, require, special, precaution, if, used, in, the, elderly, during, pregnancy, in, children, alcohol, or, drug, dependent, individuals, and, individuals, with, comorbid, psychiatric, disorders, because, of, their, muscle, relaxant, action, benzodiazepines, may, cause, respiratory, depression, in, susceptible, individuals, for, that, reason, they, are, contraindicated, in, people, with, myasthenia, gravis, sleep, apnea, bronchitis, and, copd, caution, is, required, when, benzodiazepines, are, used, in, people, with, personality, disorders, or, intellectual, disability, because, of, frequent, paradoxical, reactions, in, major, depression, they, may, precipitate, suicidal, tendencies, and, are, sometimes, used, for, suicidal, overdoses, individuals, with, a, history, of, excessive, alcohol, use, or, non, medical, use, of, opioids, or, barbiturates, should, avoid, benzodiazepines, as, there, is, a, risk, of, life, threatening, interactions, with, these, drugs, in, the, united, states, the, food, and, drug, administration, has, categorized, benzodiazepines, into, either, category, d, or, x, meaning, potential, for, harm, in, the, unborn, has, been, demonstrated, exposure, to, benzodiazepines, during, pregnancy, has, been, associated, with, a, slightly, increased, from, 0, 06, to, 0, 07, risk, of, cleft, palate, in, newborns, a, controversial, conclusion, as, some, studies, find, no, association, between, benzodiazepines, and, cleft, palate, their, use, by, expectant, mothers, shortly, before, the, delivery, may, result, in, a, floppy, infant, syndrome, newborns, with, this, condition, tend, to, have, hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and, breathing, and, feeding, difficulties, cases, of, neonatal, withdrawal, syndrome, have, been, described, in, infants, chronically, exposed, to, benzodiazepines, in, utero, this, syndrome, may, be, hard, to, recognize, as, it, starts, several, days, after, delivery, for, example, as, late, as, 21, days, for, chlordiazepoxide, the, symptoms, include, tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and, vomiting, and, may, last, for, up, to, three, to, six, months, tapering, down, the, dose, during, pregnancy, may, lessen, its, severity, if, used, in, pregnancy, those, benzodiazepines, with, a, better, and, longer, safety, record, such, as, diazepam, or, chlordiazepoxide, are, recommended, over, potentially, more, harmful, benzodiazepines, such, as, temazepam, or, triazolam, using, the, lowest, effective, dose, for, the, shortest, period, of, time, minimizes, the, risks, to, the, unborn, child, the, benefits, of, benzodiazepines, are, least, and, the, risks, are, greatest, in, the, elderly, they, are, listed, as, a, potentially, inappropriate, medication, for, older, adults, by, the, american, geriatrics, society, the, elderly, are, at, an, increased, risk, of, dependence, and, are, more, sensitive, to, the, adverse, effects, such, as, memory, problems, daytime, sedation, impaired, motor, coordination, and, increased, risk, of, motor, vehicle, accidents, and, falls, and, an, increased, risk, of, hip, fractures, the, long, term, effects, of, benzodiazepines, and, benzodiazepine, dependence, in, the, elderly, can, resemble, dementia, depression, or, anxiety, syndromes, and, progressively, worsens, over, time, adverse, effects, on, cognition, can, be, mistaken, for, the, effects, of, old, age, the, benefits, of, withdrawal, include, improved, cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced, risk, incontinence, and, a, reduced, risk, of, falls, and, fractures, the, success, of, gradual, tapering, benzodiazepines, is, as, great, in, the, elderly, as, in, younger, people, benzodiazepines, should, be, prescribed, to, the, elderly, only, with, caution, and, only, for, a, short, period, at, low, doses, short, to, intermediate, acting, benzodiazepines, are, preferred, in, the, elderly, such, as, oxazepam, and, temazepam, the, high, potency, benzodiazepines, alprazolam, and, triazolam, and, long, acting, benzodiazepines, are, not, recommended, in, the, elderly, due, to, increased, adverse, effects, nonbenzodiazepines, such, as, zaleplon, and, zolpidem, and, low, doses, of, sedating, antidepressants, are, sometimes, used, as, alternatives, to, benzodiazepines, long, term, use, of, benzodiazepines, is, associated, with, increased, risk, of, cognitive, impairment, and, dementia, and, reduction, in, prescribing, levels, is, likely, to, reduce, dementia, risk, the, association, of, a, history, of, benzodiazepine, use, and, cognitive, decline, is, unclear, with, some, studies, reporting, a, lower, risk, of, cognitive, decline, in, former, users, some, finding, no, association, and, some, indicating, an, increased, risk, of, cognitive, decline, benzodiazepines, are, sometimes, prescribed, to, treat, behavioral, symptoms, of, dementia, however, like, antidepressants, they, have, little, evidence, of, effectiveness, although, antipsychotics, have, shown, some, benefit, cognitive, impairing, effects, of, benzodiazepines, that, occur, frequently, in, the, elderly, can, also, worsen, dementia, the, most, common, side, effects, of, benzodiazepines, are, related, to, their, sedating, and, muscle, relaxing, action, they, include, drowsiness, dizziness, and, decreased, alertness, and, concentration, lack, of, coordination, may, result, in, falls, and, injuries, particularly, in, the, elderly, another, result, is, impairment, of, driving, skills, and, increased, likelihood, of, road, traffic, accidents, decreased, libido, and, erection, problems, are, a, common, side, effect, depression, and, disinhibition, may, emerge, hypotension, and, suppressed, breathing, hypoventilation, may, be, encountered, with, intravenous, use, less, common, side, effects, include, nausea, and, changes, in, appetite, blurred, vision, confusion, euphoria, depersonalization, and, nightmares, cases, of, liver, toxicity, have, been, described, but, are, very, rare, 183, 189, the, long, term, effects, of, benzodiazepine, use, can, include, cognitive, impairment, as, well, as, affective, and, behavioural, problems, feelings, of, turmoil, difficulty, in, thinking, constructively, loss, of, sex, drive, agoraphobia, and, social, phobia, increasing, anxiety, and, depression, loss, of, interest, in, leisure, pursuits, and, interests, and, an, inability, to, experience, or, express, feelings, can, also, occur, not, everyone, however, experiences, problems, with, long, term, use, additionally, an, altered, perception, of, self, environment, and, relationships, may, occur, a, study, published, in, 2020, found, that, long, term, use, of, prescription, benzodiazepines, is, associated, with, an, increase, in, all, cause, mortality, among, those, age, 65, or, younger, but, not, those, older, than, 65, the, study, also, found, that, all, cause, mortality, was, increased, further, in, cases, in, which, benzodiazepines, are, co, prescribed, with, opioids, relative, to, cases, in, which, benzodiazepines, are, prescribed, without, opioids, but, again, only, in, those, age, 65, or, younger, compared, to, other, sedative, hypnotics, visits, to, the, hospital, involving, benzodiazepines, had, a, 66, greater, odds, of, a, serious, adverse, health, outcome, this, included, hospitalization, patient, transfer, or, death, and, visits, involving, a, combination, of, benzodiazepines, and, non, benzodiapine, receptor, agonists, had, almost, four, times, increased, odds, of, a, serious, health, outcome, in, september, 2020, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, required, the, boxed, warning, be, updated, for, all, benzodiazepine, medicines, to, describe, the, risks, of, abuse, misuse, addiction, physical, dependence, and, withdrawal, reactions, consistently, across, all, the, medicines, in, the, class, the, short, term, use, of, benzodiazepines, adversely, affects, multiple, areas, of, cognition, the, most, notable, one, being, that, it, interferes, with, the, formation, and, consolidation, of, memories, of, new, material, and, may, induce, complete, anterograde, amnesia, however, researchers, hold, contrary, opinions, regarding, the, effects, of, long, term, administration, one, view, is, that, many, of, the, short, term, effects, continue, into, the, long, term, and, may, even, worsen, and, are, not, resolved, after, stopping, benzodiazepine, usage, another, view, maintains, that, cognitive, deficits, in, chronic, benzodiazepine, users, occur, only, for, a, short, period, after, the, dose, or, that, the, anxiety, disorder, is, the, cause, of, these, deficits, while, the, definitive, studies, are, lacking, the, former, view, received, support, from, a, 2004, meta, analysis, of, 13, small, studies, this, meta, analysis, found, that, long, term, use, of, benzodiazepines, was, associated, with, moderate, to, large, adverse, effects, on, all, areas, of, cognition, with, visuospatial, memory, being, the, most, commonly, detected, impairment, some, of, the, other, impairments, reported, were, decreased, iq, visiomotor, coordination, information, processing, verbal, learning, and, concentration, the, authors, of, the, meta, analysis, and, a, later, reviewer, noted, that, the, applicability, of, this, meta, analysis, is, limited, because, the, subjects, were, taken, mostly, from, withdrawal, clinics, the, coexisting, drug, alcohol, use, and, psychiatric, disorders, were, not, defined, and, several, of, the, included, studies, conducted, the, cognitive, measurements, during, the, withdrawal, period, paradoxical, reactions, such, as, increased, seizures, in, epileptics, aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability, and, suicidal, behavior, sometimes, occur, these, reactions, have, been, explained, as, consequences, of, disinhibition, and, the, subsequent, loss, of, control, over, socially, unacceptable, behavior, paradoxical, reactions, are, rare, in, the, general, population, with, an, incidence, rate, below, 1, and, similar, to, placebo, however, they, occur, with, greater, frequency, in, recreational, abusers, individuals, with, borderline, personality, disorder, children, and, patients, on, high, dosage, regimes, in, these, groups, impulse, control, problems, are, perhaps, the, most, important, risk, factor, for, disinhibition, learning, disabilities, and, neurological, disorders, are, also, significant, risks, most, reports, of, disinhibition, involve, high, doses, of, high, potency, benzodiazepines, paradoxical, effects, may, also, appear, after, chronic, use, of, benzodiazepines, while, benzodiazepines, may, have, short, term, benefits, for, anxiety, sleep, and, agitation, in, some, patients, long, term, i, e, greater, than, 2, 4, weeks, use, can, result, in, a, worsening, of, the, very, symptoms, the, medications, are, meant, to, treat, potential, explanations, include, exacerbating, cognitive, problems, that, are, already, common, in, anxiety, disorders, causing, or, worsening, depression, and, suicidality, disrupting, sleep, architecture, by, inhibiting, deep, stage, sleep, withdrawal, symptoms, or, rebound, symptoms, in, between, doses, mimicking, or, exacerbating, underlying, anxiety, or, sleep, disorders, inhibiting, the, benefits, of, psychotherapy, by, inhibiting, memory, consolidation, and, reducing, fear, extinction, and, reducing, coping, with, trauma, stress, and, increasing, vulnerability, to, future, stress, the, latter, two, explanations, may, be, why, benzodiazepines, are, ineffective, and, or, potentially, harmful, in, ptsd, and, phobias, anxiety, insomnia, and, irritability, may, be, temporarily, exacerbated, during, withdrawal, but, psychiatric, symptoms, after, discontinuation, are, usually, less, than, even, while, taking, benzodiazepines, functioning, significantly, improves, within, 1, year, of, discontinuation, the, main, problem, of, the, chronic, use, of, benzodiazepines, is, the, development, of, tolerance, and, dependence, tolerance, manifests, itself, as, diminished, pharmacological, effect, and, develops, relatively, quickly, to, the, sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and, muscle, relaxant, actions, of, benzodiazepines, tolerance, to, anti, anxiety, effects, develops, more, slowly, with, little, evidence, of, continued, effectiveness, beyond, four, to, six, months, of, continued, use, in, general, tolerance, to, the, amnesic, effects, does, not, occur, however, controversy, exists, as, to, tolerance, to, the, anxiolytic, effects, with, some, evidence, that, benzodiazepines, retain, efficacy, and, opposing, evidence, from, a, systematic, review, of, the, literature, that, tolerance, frequently, occurs, and, some, evidence, that, anxiety, may, worsen, with, long, term, use, the, question, of, tolerance, to, the, amnesic, effects, of, benzodiazepines, is, likewise, unclear, some, evidence, suggests, that, partial, tolerance, does, develop, and, that, memory, impairment, is, limited, to, a, narrow, window, within, 90, minutes, after, each, dose, a, major, disadvantage, of, benzodiazepines, is, that, tolerance, to, therapeutic, effects, develops, relatively, quickly, while, many, adverse, effects, persist, tolerance, develops, to, hypnotic, and, myorelaxant, effects, within, days, to, weeks, and, to, anticonvulsant, and, anxiolytic, effects, within, weeks, to, months, therefore, benzodiazepines, are, unlikely, to, be, effective, long, term, treatments, for, sleep, and, anxiety, while, bzd, therapeutic, effects, disappear, with, tolerance, depression, and, impulsivity, with, high, suicidal, risk, commonly, persist, several, studies, have, confirmed, that, long, term, benzodiazepines, are, not, significantly, different, from, placebo, for, sleep, or, anxiety, this, may, explain, why, patients, commonly, increase, doses, over, time, and, many, eventually, take, more, than, one, type, of, benzodiazepine, after, the, first, loses, effectiveness, additionally, because, tolerance, to, benzodiazepine, sedating, effects, develops, more, quickly, than, does, tolerance, to, brainstem, depressant, effects, those, taking, more, benzodiazepines, to, achieve, desired, effects, may, experience, sudden, respiratory, depression, hypotension, or, death, most, patients, with, anxiety, disorders, and, ptsd, have, symptoms, that, persist, for, at, least, several, months, making, tolerance, to, therapeutic, effects, a, distinct, problem, for, them, and, necessitating, the, need, for, more, effective, long, term, treatment, e, g, psychotherapy, serotonergic, antidepressants, discontinuation, of, benzodiazepines, or, abrupt, reduction, of, the, dose, even, after, a, relatively, short, course, of, treatment, two, to, four, weeks, may, result, in, two, groups, of, symptoms, rebound, and, withdrawal, rebound, symptoms, are, the, return, of, the, symptoms, for, which, the, patient, was, treated, but, worse, than, before, withdrawal, symptoms, are, the, new, symptoms, that, occur, when, the, benzodiazepine, is, stopped, they, are, the, main, sign, of, physical, dependence, the, most, frequent, symptoms, of, withdrawal, from, benzodiazepines, are, insomnia, gastric, problems, tremors, agitation, fearfulness, and, muscle, spasms, the, less, frequent, effects, are, irritability, sweating, depersonalization, derealization, hypersensitivity, to, stimuli, depression, suicidal, behavior, psychosis, seizures, and, delirium, tremens, severe, symptoms, usually, occur, as, a, result, of, abrupt, or, over, rapid, withdrawal, abrupt, withdrawal, can, be, dangerous, and, lead, to, excitotoxicity, causing, damage, and, even, death, to, nerve, cells, as, a, result, of, excessive, levels, of, the, excitatory, neurotransmitter, glutamate, increased, glutamatergic, activity, is, thought, to, be, part, of, a, compensatory, mechanism, to, chronic, gabaergic, inhibition, from, benzodiazepines, therefore, a, gradual, reduction, regimen, is, recommended, symptoms, may, also, occur, during, a, gradual, dosage, reduction, but, are, typically, less, severe, and, may, persist, as, part, of, a, protracted, withdrawal, syndrome, for, months, after, cessation, of, benzodiazepines, approximately, 10, of, patients, experience, a, notable, protracted, withdrawal, syndrome, which, can, persist, for, many, months, or, in, some, cases, a, year, or, longer, protracted, symptoms, tend, to, resemble, those, seen, during, the, first, couple, of, months, of, withdrawal, but, usually, are, of, a, sub, acute, level, of, severity, such, symptoms, do, gradually, lessen, over, time, eventually, disappearing, altogether, benzodiazepines, have, a, reputation, with, patients, and, doctors, for, causing, a, severe, and, traumatic, withdrawal, however, this, is, in, large, part, due, to, the, withdrawal, process, being, poorly, managed, over, rapid, withdrawal, from, benzodiazepines, increases, the, severity, of, the, withdrawal, syndrome, and, increases, the, failure, rate, a, slow, and, gradual, withdrawal, customised, to, the, individual, and, if, indicated, psychological, support, is, the, most, effective, way, of, managing, the, withdrawal, opinion, as, to, the, time, needed, to, complete, withdrawal, ranges, from, four, weeks, to, several, years, a, goal, of, less, than, six, months, has, been, suggested, but, due, to, factors, such, as, dosage, and, type, of, benzodiazepine, reasons, for, prescription, lifestyle, personality, environmental, stresses, and, amount, of, available, support, a, year, or, more, may, be, needed, to, withdraw, 183, 184, withdrawal, is, best, managed, by, transferring, the, physically, dependent, patient, to, an, equivalent, dose, of, diazepam, because, it, has, the, longest, half, life, of, all, of, the, benzodiazepines, is, metabolised, into, long, acting, active, metabolites, and, is, available, in, low, potency, tablets, which, can, be, quartered, for, smaller, doses, a, further, benefit, is, that, it, is, available, in, liquid, form, which, allows, for, even, smaller, reductions, chlordiazepoxide, which, also, has, a, long, half, life, and, long, acting, active, metabolites, can, be, used, as, an, alternative, nonbenzodiazepines, are, contraindicated, during, benzodiazepine, withdrawal, as, they, are, cross, tolerant, with, benzodiazepines, and, can, induce, dependence, alcohol, is, also, cross, tolerant, with, benzodiazepines, and, more, toxic, and, thus, caution, is, needed, to, avoid, replacing, one, dependence, with, another, during, withdrawal, fluoroquinolone, based, antibiotics, are, best, avoided, if, possible, they, displace, benzodiazepines, from, their, binding, site, and, reduce, gaba, function, and, thus, may, aggravate, withdrawal, symptoms, antipsychotics, are, not, recommended, for, benzodiazepine, withdrawal, or, other, cns, depressant, withdrawal, states, especially, clozapine, olanzapine, or, low, potency, phenothiazines, e, g, chlorpromazine, as, they, lower, the, seizure, threshold, and, can, worsen, withdrawal, effects, if, used, extreme, caution, is, required, withdrawal, from, long, term, benzodiazepines, is, beneficial, for, most, individuals, withdrawal, of, benzodiazepines, from, long, term, users, in, general, leads, to, improved, physical, and, mental, health, particularly, in, the, elderly, although, some, long, term, users, report, continued, benefit, from, taking, benzodiazepines, this, may, be, the, result, of, suppression, of, withdrawal, effects, beyond, the, well, established, link, between, benzodiazepines, and, psychomotor, impairment, resulting, in, motor, vehicle, accidents, and, falls, leading, to, fracture, research, in, the, 2000s, and, 2010s, has, raised, the, association, between, benzodiazepines, and, z, drugs, and, other, as, of, yet, unproven, adverse, effects, including, dementia, cancer, infections, pancreatitis, and, respiratory, disease, exacerbations, a, number, of, studies, have, drawn, an, association, between, long, term, benzodiazepine, use, and, neuro, degenerative, disease, particularly, alzheimer, s, disease, it, has, been, determined, that, long, term, use, of, benzodiazepines, is, associated, with, increased, dementia, risk, even, after, controlling, for, protopathic, bias, some, observational, studies, have, detected, significant, associations, between, benzodiazepines, and, respiratory, infections, such, as, pneumonia, where, others, have, not, a, large, meta, analysis, of, pre, marketing, randomized, controlled, trials, on, the, pharmacologically, related, z, drugs, suggest, a, small, increase, in, infection, risk, as, well, an, immunodeficiency, effect, from, the, action, of, benzodiazepines, on, gaba, a, receptors, has, been, postulated, from, animal, studies, a, meta, analysis, of, observational, studies, has, determined, an, association, between, benzodiazepine, use, and, cancer, though, the, risk, across, different, agents, and, different, cancers, varied, significantly, in, terms, of, experimental, basic, science, evidence, an, analysis, of, carcinogenetic, and, genotoxicity, data, for, various, benzodiazepines, has, suggested, a, small, possibility, of, carcinogenesis, for, a, small, number, of, benzodiazepines, the, evidence, suggesting, a, link, between, benzodiazepines, and, z, drugs, and, pancreatic, inflammation, is, very, sparse, and, limited, to, a, few, observational, studies, from, taiwan, a, criticism, of, confounding, can, be, applied, to, these, findings, as, with, the, other, controversial, associations, above, further, well, designed, research, from, other, populations, as, well, as, a, biologically, plausible, mechanism, is, required, to, confirm, this, association, although, benzodiazepines, are, much, safer, in, overdose, than, their, predecessors, the, barbiturates, they, can, still, cause, problems, in, overdose, taken, alone, they, rarely, cause, severe, complications, in, overdose, statistics, in, england, showed, that, benzodiazepines, were, responsible, for, 3, 8, of, all, deaths, by, poisoning, from, a, single, drug, however, combining, these, drugs, with, alcohol, opiates, or, tricyclic, antidepressants, markedly, raises, the, toxicity, the, elderly, are, more, sensitive, to, the, side, effects, of, benzodiazepines, and, poisoning, may, even, occur, from, their, long, term, use, the, various, benzodiazepines, differ, in, their, toxicity, temazepam, appears, most, toxic, in, overdose, and, when, used, with, other, drugs, the, symptoms, of, a, benzodiazepine, overdose, may, include, drowsiness, slurred, speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory, depression, and, cardiorespiratory, arrest, a, reversal, agent, for, benzodiazepines, exists, flumazenil, anexate, its, use, as, an, antidote, is, not, routinely, recommended, because, of, the, high, risk, of, resedation, and, seizures, in, a, double, blind, placebo, controlled, trial, of, 326, people, 4, people, had, serious, adverse, events, and, 61, became, resedated, following, the, use, of, flumazenil, numerous, contraindications, to, its, use, exist, it, is, contraindicated, in, people, with, a, history, of, long, term, use, of, benzodiazepines, those, having, ingested, a, substance, that, lowers, the, seizure, threshold, or, may, cause, an, arrhythmia, and, in, those, with, abnormal, vital, signs, one, study, found, that, only, 10, of, the, people, presenting, with, a, benzodiazepine, overdose, are, suitable, candidates, for, treatment, with, flumazenil, individual, benzodiazepines, may, have, different, interactions, with, certain, drugs, depending, on, their, metabolism, pathway, benzodiazepines, can, be, divided, roughly, into, two, groups, the, largest, group, consists, of, those, that, are, metabolized, by, cytochrome, p450, cyp450, enzymes, and, possess, significant, potential, for, interactions, with, other, drugs, the, other, group, comprises, those, that, are, metabolized, through, glucuronidation, such, as, lorazepam, oxazepam, and, temazepam, and, in, general, have, few, drug, interactions, many, drugs, including, oral, contraceptives, some, antibiotics, antidepressants, and, antifungal, agents, inhibit, cytochrome, enzymes, in, the, liver, they, reduce, the, rate, of, elimination, of, the, benzodiazepines, that, are, metabolized, by, cyp450, leading, to, possibly, excessive, drug, accumulation, and, increased, side, effects, in, contrast, drugs, that, induce, cytochrome, p450, enzymes, such, as, st, john, s, wort, the, antibiotic, rifampicin, and, the, anticonvulsants, carbamazepine, and, phenytoin, accelerate, elimination, of, many, benzodiazepines, and, decrease, their, action, taking, benzodiazepines, with, alcohol, opioids, and, other, central, nervous, system, depressants, potentiates, their, action, this, often, results, in, increased, sedation, impaired, motor, coordination, suppressed, breathing, and, other, adverse, effects, that, have, potential, to, be, lethal, antacids, can, slow, down, absorption, of, some, benzodiazepines, however, this, effect, is, marginal, and, inconsistent, benzodiazepines, work, by, increasing, the, effectiveness, of, the, endogenous, chemical, gaba, to, decrease, the, excitability, of, neurons, this, reduces, the, communication, between, neurons, and, therefore, has, a, calming, effect, on, many, of, the, functions, of, the, brain, gaba, controls, the, excitability, of, neurons, by, binding, to, the, gaba, a, receptor, the, gaba, a, receptor, is, a, protein, complex, located, in, the, synapses, between, neurons, all, gaba, a, receptors, contain, an, ion, channel, that, conducts, chloride, ions, across, neuronal, cell, membranes, and, two, binding, sites, for, the, neurotransmitter, gamma, aminobutyric, acid, gaba, while, a, subset, of, gaba, a, receptor, complexes, also, contain, a, single, binding, site, for, benzodiazepines, binding, of, benzodiazepines, to, this, receptor, complex, does, not, alter, binding, of, gaba, unlike, other, positive, allosteric, modulators, that, increase, ligand, binding, benzodiazepine, binding, acts, as, a, positive, allosteric, modulator, by, increasing, the, total, conduction, of, chloride, ions, across, the, neuronal, cell, membrane, when, gaba, is, already, bound, to, its, receptor, this, increased, chloride, ion, influx, hyperpolarizes, the, neuron, s, membrane, potential, as, a, result, the, difference, between, resting, potential, and, threshold, potential, is, increased, and, firing, is, less, likely, different, gaba, a, receptor, subtypes, have, varying, distributions, within, different, regions, of, the, brain, and, therefore, control, distinct, neuronal, circuits, hence, activation, of, different, gaba, a, receptor, subtypes, by, benzodiazepines, may, result, in, distinct, pharmacological, actions, in, terms, of, the, mechanism, of, action, of, benzodiazepines, their, similarities, are, too, great, to, separate, them, into, individual, categories, such, as, anxiolytic, or, hypnotic, for, example, a, hypnotic, administered, in, low, doses, produces, anxiety, relieving, effects, whereas, a, benzodiazepine, marketed, as, an, anti, anxiety, drug, at, higher, doses, induces, sleep, the, subset, of, gaba, a, receptors, that, also, bind, benzodiazepines, are, referred, to, as, benzodiazepine, receptors, bzr, the, gaba, a, receptor, is, a, heteromer, composed, of, five, subunits, the, most, common, ones, being, two, s, two, s, and, one, 2, 2, 1, for, each, subunit, many, subtypes, exist, 1, 6, 1, 3, and, 1, 3, gaba, a, receptors, that, are, made, up, of, different, combinations, of, subunit, subtypes, have, different, properties, different, distributions, in, the, brain, and, different, activities, relative, to, pharmacological, and, clinical, effects, benzodiazepines, bind, at, the, interface, of, the, and, subunits, on, the, gaba, a, receptor, binding, also, requires, that, alpha, subunits, contain, a, histidine, amino, acid, residue, i, e, 1, 2, 3, and, 5, containing, gaba, a, receptors, for, this, reason, benzodiazepines, show, no, affinity, for, gaba, a, receptors, containing, 4, and, 6, subunits, with, an, arginine, instead, of, a, histidine, residue, once, bound, to, the, benzodiazepine, receptor, the, benzodiazepine, ligand, locks, the, benzodiazepine, receptor, into, a, conformation, in, which, it, has, a, greater, affinity, for, the, gaba, neurotransmitter, this, increases, the, frequency, of, the, opening, of, the, associated, chloride, ion, channel, and, hyperpolarizes, the, membrane, of, the, associated, neuron, the, inhibitory, effect, of, the, available, gaba, is, potentiated, leading, to, sedative, and, anxiolytic, effects, for, instance, those, ligands, with, high, activity, at, the, 1, are, associated, with, stronger, hypnotic, effects, whereas, those, with, higher, affinity, for, gaba, a, receptors, containing, 2, and, or, 3, subunits, have, good, anti, anxiety, activity, gaba, a, receptors, participate, in, the, regulation, of, synaptic, pruning, by, prompting, microglial, spine, engulfment, benzodiazepines, have, been, shown, to, upregulate, microglial, spine, engulfment, and, prompt, overzealous, eradication, of, synaptic, connections, this, mechanism, may, help, explain, the, increased, risk, of, dementia, associated, with, long, term, benzodiazepine, treatment, the, benzodiazepine, class, of, drugs, also, interact, with, peripheral, benzodiazepine, receptors, peripheral, benzodiazepine, receptors, are, present, in, peripheral, nervous, system, tissues, glial, cells, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, central, nervous, system, these, peripheral, receptors, are, not, structurally, related, or, coupled, to, gaba, a, receptors, they, modulate, the, immune, system, and, are, involved, in, the, body, response, to, injury, benzodiazepines, also, function, as, weak, adenosine, reuptake, inhibitors, it, has, been, suggested, that, some, of, their, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and, muscle, relaxant, effects, may, be, in, part, mediated, by, this, action, benzodiazepines, have, binding, sites, in, the, periphery, however, their, effects, on, muscle, tone, is, not, mediated, through, these, peripheral, receptors, the, peripheral, binding, sites, for, benzodiazepines, are, present, in, immune, cells, and, gastrointestinal, tract, a, benzodiazepine, can, be, placed, into, one, of, three, groups, by, its, elimination, half, life, or, time, it, takes, for, the, body, to, eliminate, half, of, the, dose, some, benzodiazepines, have, long, acting, active, metabolites, such, as, diazepam, and, chlordiazepoxide, which, are, metabolised, into, desmethyldiazepam, desmethyldiazepam, has, a, half, life, of, 36, 200, hours, and, flurazepam, with, the, main, active, metabolite, of, desalkylflurazepam, with, a, half, life, of, 40, 250, hours, these, long, acting, metabolites, are, partial, agonists, benzodiazepines, share, a, similar, chemical, structure, and, their, effects, in, humans, are, mainly, produced, by, the, allosteric, modification, of, a, specific, kind, of, neurotransmitter, receptor, the, gaba, a, receptor, which, increases, the, overall, conductance, of, these, inhibitory, channels, this, results, in, the, various, therapeutic, effects, as, well, as, adverse, effects, of, benzodiazepines, other, less, important, modes, of, action, are, also, known, the, term, benzodiazepine, is, the, chemical, name, for, the, heterocyclic, ring, system, see, figure, to, the, right, which, is, a, fusion, between, the, benzene, and, diazepine, ring, systems, under, hantzsch, widman, nomenclature, a, diazepine, is, a, heterocycle, with, two, nitrogen, atoms, five, carbon, atom, and, the, maximum, possible, number, of, cumulative, double, bonds, the, benzo, prefix, indicates, the, benzene, ring, fused, onto, the, diazepine, ring, benzodiazepine, drugs, are, substituted, 1, 4, benzodiazepines, although, the, chemical, term, can, refer, to, many, other, compounds, that, do, not, have, useful, pharmacological, properties, different, benzodiazepine, drugs, have, different, side, groups, attached, to, this, central, structure, the, different, side, groups, affect, the, binding, of, the, molecule, to, the, gaba, a, receptor, and, so, modulate, the, pharmacological, properties, many, of, the, pharmacologically, active, classical, benzodiazepine, drugs, contain, the, 5, phenyl, 1, h, benzo, diazepin, 2, 3, h, one, substructure, see, figure, to, the, right, benzodiazepines, have, been, found, to, mimic, protein, reverse, turns, structurally, which, enable, them, with, their, biological, activity, in, many, cases, nonbenzodiazepines, also, bind, to, the, benzodiazepine, binding, site, on, the, gaba, a, receptor, and, possess, similar, pharmacological, properties, while, the, nonbenzodiazepines, are, by, definition, structurally, unrelated, to, the, benzodiazepines, both, classes, of, drugs, possess, a, common, pharmacophore, see, figure, to, the, lower, right, which, explains, their, binding, to, a, common, receptor, site, the, first, benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide, librium, was, synthesized, in, 1955, by, leo, sternbach, while, working, at, hoffmann, la, roche, on, the, development, of, tranquilizers, the, pharmacological, properties, of, the, compounds, prepared, initially, were, disappointing, and, sternbach, abandoned, the, project, two, years, later, in, april, 1957, co, worker, earl, reeder, noticed, a, nicely, crystalline, compound, left, over, from, the, discontinued, project, while, spring, cleaning, in, the, lab, this, compound, later, named, chlordiazepoxide, had, not, been, tested, in, 1955, because, of, sternbach, s, focus, on, other, issues, expecting, pharmacology, results, to, be, negative, and, hoping, to, publish, the, chemistry, related, findings, researchers, submitted, it, for, a, standard, battery, of, animal, tests, the, compound, showed, very, strong, sedative, anticonvulsant, and, muscle, relaxant, effects, these, impressive, clinical, findings, led, to, its, speedy, introduction, throughout, the, world, in, 1960, under, the, brand, name, librium, following, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, marketed, by, hoffmann, la, roche, under, the, brand, name, valium, in, 1963, and, for, a, while, the, two, were, the, most, commercially, successful, drugs, the, introduction, of, benzodiazepines, led, to, a, decrease, in, the, prescription, of, barbiturates, and, by, the, 1970s, they, had, largely, replaced, the, older, drugs, for, sedative, and, hypnotic, uses, the, new, group, of, drugs, was, initially, greeted, with, optimism, by, the, medical, profession, but, gradually, concerns, arose, in, particular, the, risk, of, dependence, became, evident, in, the, 1980s, benzodiazepines, have, a, unique, history, in, that, they, were, responsible, for, the, largest, ever, class, action, lawsuit, against, drug, manufacturers, in, the, united, kingdom, involving, 14, 000, patients, and, 1, 800, law, firms, that, alleged, the, manufacturers, knew, of, the, dependence, potential, but, intentionally, withheld, this, information, from, doctors, at, the, same, time, 117, general, practitioners, and, 50, health, authorities, were, sued, by, patients, to, recover, damages, for, the, harmful, effects, of, dependence, and, withdrawal, this, led, some, doctors, to, require, a, signed, consent, form, from, their, patients, and, to, recommend, that, all, patients, be, adequately, warned, of, the, risks, of, dependence, and, withdrawal, before, starting, treatment, with, benzodiazepines, the, court, case, against, the, drug, manufacturers, never, reached, a, verdict, legal, aid, had, been, withdrawn, and, there, were, allegations, that, the, consultant, psychiatrists, the, expert, witnesses, had, a, conflict, of, interest, the, court, case, fell, through, at, a, cost, of, 30, million, and, led, to, more, cautious, funding, through, legal, aid, for, future, cases, this, made, future, class, action, lawsuits, less, likely, to, succeed, due, to, the, high, cost, from, financing, a, smaller, number, of, cases, and, increasing, charges, for, losing, the, case, for, each, person, involved, although, antidepressants, with, anxiolytic, properties, have, been, introduced, and, there, is, increasing, awareness, of, the, adverse, effects, of, benzodiazepines, prescriptions, for, short, term, anxiety, relief, have, not, significantly,
