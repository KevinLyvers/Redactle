8, 11, see, classification, the, common, raven, corvus, corax, is, a, large, all, black, passerine, bird, it, is, the, most, widely, distributed, of, all, corvids, found, across, the, northern, hemisphere, it, is, a, raven, known, by, many, names, at, the, subspecies, level, there, are, at, least, eight, subspecies, with, little, variation, in, appearance, although, recent, research, has, demonstrated, significant, genetic, differences, among, populations, from, various, regions, it, is, one, of, the, two, largest, corvids, alongside, the, thick, billed, raven, and, is, possibly, the, heaviest, passerine, bird, at, maturity, the, common, raven, averages, 63, centimetres, 25, inches, in, length, and, 1, 47, kilograms, 3, 2, pounds, in, mass, although, their, typical, lifespan, is, considerably, shorter, common, ravens, can, live, more, than, 23, years, in, the, wild, young, birds, may, travel, in, flocks, but, later, mate, for, life, with, each, mated, pair, defending, a, territory, common, ravens, have, coexisted, with, humans, for, thousands, of, years, and, in, some, areas, have, been, so, numerous, that, people, have, regarded, them, as, pests, part, of, their, success, as, a, species, is, due, to, their, omnivorous, diet, they, are, extremely, versatile, and, opportunistic, in, finding, sources, of, nutrition, feeding, on, carrion, insects, cereal, grains, berries, fruit, small, animals, nesting, birds, and, food, waste, some, notable, feats, of, problem, solving, provide, evidence, that, the, common, raven, is, unusually, intelligent, over, the, centuries, the, raven, has, been, the, subject, of, mythology, folklore, art, and, literature, in, many, cultures, including, the, indigenous, cultures, of, scandinavia, ancient, ireland, and, wales, bhutan, the, northwest, coast, of, north, america, and, siberia, and, northeast, asia, the, common, raven, has, been, revered, as, a, spiritual, figure, or, godlike, creature, the, common, raven, was, one, of, the, many, species, originally, described, with, its, type, locality, given, as, europe, by, carl, linnaeus, in, his, landmark, 1758, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, and, it, still, bears, its, original, name, of, corvus, corax, it, is, the, type, species, of, the, genus, corvus, derived, from, the, latin, word, for, raven, the, specific, epithet, corax, is, the, latinized, form, of, the, greek, word, meaning, raven, or, crow, the, modern, english, word, raven, has, cognates, in, many, other, germanic, languages, including, old, norse, and, subsequently, modern, icelandic, hrafn, and, old, high, german, h, raban, all, which, descend, from, proto, germanic, khrabanas, an, old, scottish, word, corby, or, corbie, akin, to, the, french, corbeau, has, been, used, for, both, this, bird, and, the, carrion, crow, collective, nouns, for, a, group, of, ravens, or, at, least, the, common, raven, include, unkindness, and, conspiracy, the, closest, relatives, of, the, common, raven, are, the, brown, necked, raven, c, ruficollis, the, pied, crow, c, albus, of, africa, and, the, chihuahuan, raven, c, cryptoleucus, of, the, north, american, southwest, while, some, authorities, have, recognized, as, many, as, 11, subspecies, others, recognize, only, eight, the, name, c, c, laurencei, also, spelt, lawrencii, or, laurencii, is, sometimes, used, instead, of, c, c, subcorax, it, is, based, on, the, population, from, sindh, described, by, hume, in, 1873, and, is, sometimes, preferred, since, the, type, specimen, of, subcorax, collected, by, nikolai, severtzov, is, possibly, a, brown, necked, raven, the, population, of, this, subspecies, restricted, to, the, sindh, district, of, pakistan, and, the, adjoining, regions, of, northwestern, india, is, sometimes, known, as, the, punjab, raven, the, common, raven, evolved, in, the, old, world, and, crossed, the, bering, land, bridge, into, north, america, recent, genetic, studies, which, examined, the, dna, of, common, ravens, from, across, the, world, have, determined, that, the, birds, fall, into, at, least, two, clades, a, california, clade, found, only, in, the, southwestern, united, states, and, a, holarctic, clade, found, across, the, rest, of, the, northern, hemisphere, birds, from, both, clades, look, alike, but, the, groups, are, genetically, distinct, and, began, to, diverge, about, two, million, years, ago, the, findings, indicate, that, based, on, mitochondrial, dna, common, ravens, from, the, rest, of, the, united, states, are, more, closely, related, to, those, in, europe, and, asia, than, to, those, in, the, california, clade, and, that, common, ravens, in, the, california, clade, are, more, closely, related, to, the, chihuahuan, raven, c, cryptoleucus, than, to, those, in, the, holarctic, clade, ravens, in, the, holarctic, clade, are, more, closely, related, to, the, pied, crow, c, albus, than, they, are, to, the, california, clade, thus, the, common, raven, species, as, traditionally, delimited, is, considered, to, be, paraphyletic, one, explanation, for, these, genetic, findings, is, that, common, ravens, settled, in, california, at, least, two, million, years, ago, and, became, separated, from, their, relatives, in, europe, and, asia, during, a, glacial, period, one, million, years, ago, a, group, from, the, california, clade, evolved, into, a, new, species, the, chihuahuan, raven, other, members, of, the, holarctic, clade, arrived, later, in, a, separate, migration, from, asia, perhaps, at, the, same, time, as, humans, a, 2011, study, suggested, that, there, are, no, restrictions, on, gene, flow, between, the, californian, and, holarctic, common, raven, groups, and, that, the, lineages, can, remerge, effectively, reversing, a, potential, speciation, a, recent, study, of, raven, mitochondrial, dna, showed, that, the, isolated, population, from, the, canary, islands, is, distinct, from, other, populations, the, study, did, not, include, any, individuals, from, the, north, african, population, and, its, position, is, therefore, unclear, though, its, morphology, is, very, close, to, the, population, of, the, canaries, to, the, extent, that, the, two, are, often, considered, part, of, a, single, subspecies, a, mature, common, raven, ranges, between, 54, and, 71, cm, 21, and, 28, in, and, has, a, wingspan, of, 116, to, 153, cm, 46, to, 60, in, recorded, weights, range, from, 0, 69, to, 2, 250, kg, 1, 52, to, 4, 96, lb, thus, making, the, common, raven, one, of, the, heaviest, passerines, birds, from, colder, regions, such, as, the, himalayas, and, greenland, are, generally, larger, with, slightly, larger, bills, while, those, from, warmer, regions, are, smaller, with, proportionally, smaller, bills, representative, of, the, size, variation, in, the, species, ravens, from, california, weighed, an, average, of, 0, 784, kg, 1, 73, lb, those, from, alaska, weighed, an, average, of, 1, 135, kg, 2, 50, lb, and, those, from, nova, scotia, weighed, an, average, of, 1, 230, kg, 2, 71, lb, the, bill, is, large, and, slightly, curved, with, a, culmen, length, of, 5, 7, to, 8, 5, cm, 2, 2, to, 3, 3, in, easily, one, of, the, largest, bills, amongst, passerines, perhaps, only, the, thick, billed, raven, has, a, noticeably, larger, bill, it, has, a, longish, strongly, graduated, tail, at, 20, to, 26, 3, cm, 7, 9, to, 10, 4, in, and, mostly, black, iridescent, plumage, and, a, dark, brown, iris, the, throat, feathers, are, elongated, and, pointed, and, the, bases, of, the, neck, feathers, are, pale, brownish, grey, the, legs, and, feet, are, good, sized, with, a, tarsus, length, of, 6, to, 7, 2, cm, 2, 4, to, 2, 8, in, juvenile, plumage, is, similar, but, duller, with, a, blue, grey, iris, apart, from, its, greater, size, the, common, raven, differs, from, its, cousins, the, crows, by, having, a, larger, and, heavier, black, beak, shaggy, feathers, around, the, throat, and, above, the, beak, and, a, wedge, shaped, tail, flying, ravens, are, distinguished, from, crows, by, their, tail, shape, larger, wing, area, and, more, stable, soaring, style, which, generally, involves, less, wing, flapping, despite, their, bulk, ravens, are, easily, as, agile, in, flight, as, their, smaller, cousins, in, flight, the, feathers, produce, a, creaking, sound, that, has, been, likened, to, the, rustle, of, silk, the, voice, of, ravens, is, also, quite, distinct, its, usual, call, being, a, deep, croak, of, a, much, more, sonorous, quality, than, a, crow, s, call, in, north, america, the, chihuahuan, raven, c, cryptoleucus, is, fairly, similar, to, the, relatively, small, common, ravens, of, the, american, southwest, and, is, best, distinguished, by, the, still, relatively, smaller, size, of, its, bill, beard, and, body, and, relatively, longer, tail, all, black, carrion, crow, c, corone, in, europe, may, suggest, a, raven, due, to, their, largish, bill, but, are, still, distinctly, smaller, and, have, the, wing, and, tail, shapes, typical, of, crows, in, the, faroe, islands, a, now, extinct, white, and, black, colour, morph, of, this, species, existed, known, as, the, pied, raven, the, ordinary, black, coloured, common, ravens, remain, widespread, in, the, archipelago, white, ravens, are, occasionally, found, in, the, wild, birds, in, british, columbia, lack, the, pink, eyes, of, an, albino, and, are, instead, leucistic, a, condition, where, an, animal, lacks, any, of, several, different, types, of, pigment, not, simply, melanin, common, ravens, have, a, wide, range, of, vocalizations, which, are, of, interest, to, ornithologists, gwinner, carried, out, important, studies, in, the, early, 1960s, recording, and, photographing, his, findings, in, great, detail, fifteen, to, 30, categories, of, vocalization, have, been, recorded, for, this, species, most, of, which, are, used, for, social, interaction, calls, recorded, include, alarm, calls, chase, calls, and, flight, calls, the, species, has, a, distinctive, deep, resonant, prruk, prruk, prruk, call, which, to, experienced, listeners, is, unlike, that, of, any, other, corvid, its, very, wide, and, complex, vocabulary, includes, a, high, knocking, toc, toc, toc, a, dry, grating, kraa, a, low, guttural, rattle, and, some, calls, of, an, almost, musical, nature, like, other, corvids, the, common, raven, can, mimic, sounds, from, their, environment, including, human, speech, non, vocal, sounds, produced, by, the, common, raven, include, wing, whistles, and, bill, snapping, clapping, or, clicking, has, been, observed, more, often, in, females, than, in, males, if, a, member, of, a, pair, is, lost, its, mate, reproduces, the, calls, of, its, lost, partner, to, encourage, its, return, the, common, raven, can, thrive, in, varied, climates, it, has, the, largest, range, of, any, member, of, the, genus, and, one, of, the, largest, of, any, passerine, they, range, throughout, the, holarctic, from, arctic, and, temperate, habitats, in, north, america, and, eurasia, to, the, deserts, of, north, africa, and, to, islands, in, the, pacific, ocean, in, the, british, isles, they, are, more, common, in, scotland, wales, northern, england, and, the, west, of, ireland, in, tibet, they, have, been, recorded, at, altitudes, up, to, 5, 000, m, 16, 400, ft, and, as, high, as, 6, 350, m, 20, 600, ft, on, mount, everest, the, population, sometimes, known, as, the, punjab, raven, described, as, corvus, corax, laurencei, also, spelt, lawrencii, or, laurencii, by, allan, octavian, hume, but, more, often, considered, synonymous, with, subcorax, is, restricted, to, the, sindh, district, of, pakistan, and, adjoining, regions, of, northwestern, india, they, are, generally, resident, within, their, range, for, the, whole, year, in, his, 1950, work, gr, nlands, fugle, noted, ornithologist, finn, salomonsen, indicated, that, common, ravens, did, not, overwinter, in, the, arctic, however, in, arctic, canada, and, alaska, they, are, found, year, round, young, birds, may, disperse, locally, in, the, united, kingdom, the, common, raven, s, range, is, currently, increasing, it, favours, mountainous, or, coastal, terrain, but, can, also, be, found, in, parks, with, tall, trees, suitable, for, use, as, habitation, its, population, is, at, its, most, dense, in, the, north, and, west, of, the, country, though, the, species, is, expanding, its, population, southwards, most, common, ravens, prefer, wooded, areas, with, large, expanses, of, open, land, nearby, or, coastal, regions, for, their, nesting, sites, and, feeding, grounds, in, some, areas, of, dense, human, population, such, as, california, in, the, united, states, they, take, advantage, of, a, plentiful, food, supply, and, have, seen, a, surge, in, their, numbers, on, coasts, individuals, of, this, species, are, often, evenly, distributed, and, prefer, to, build, their, nest, sites, along, sea, cliffs, common, ravens, are, often, located, in, coastal, regions, because, these, areas, provide, easy, access, to, water, and, a, variety, of, food, sources, also, coastal, regions, have, stable, weather, patterns, without, extreme, cold, or, hot, temperatures, in, general, common, ravens, live, in, a, wide, array, of, environments, but, prefer, heavily, contoured, landscapes, when, the, environment, changes, in, vast, degrees, these, birds, will, respond, with, a, stress, response, the, hormone, known, as, corticosterone, is, activated, by, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, corticosterone, is, activated, when, the, bird, is, exposed, to, stress, such, as, migrating, great, distances, common, ravens, usually, travel, in, mated, pairs, although, young, birds, may, form, flocks, relationships, between, common, ravens, are, often, quarrelsome, yet, they, demonstrate, considerable, devotion, to, their, families, owing, to, its, size, gregariousness, and, its, defensive, abilities, the, common, raven, has, few, natural, predators, predators, of, its, eggs, include, owls, martens, and, sometimes, eagles, ravens, are, quite, vigorous, at, defending, their, young, and, are, usually, successful, at, driving, off, perceived, threats, they, attack, potential, predators, by, flying, at, them, and, lunging, with, their, large, bills, humans, are, occasionally, attacked, if, they, get, close, to, a, raven, nest, though, serious, injuries, are, unlikely, there, are, a, few, records, of, large, birds, of, prey, taking, ravens, their, attackers, in, america, have, reportedly, included, great, horned, owls, northern, goshawks, bald, eagles, golden, eagles, and, red, tailed, hawks, it, is, possible, that, the, two, hawk, species, only, attack, young, ravens, in, one, instance, a, peregrine, falcon, swooped, at, a, newly, fledged, raven, but, was, chased, off, by, the, parent, ravens, in, eurasia, their, reported, predators, include, in, addition, to, golden, eagles, eurasian, eagle, owls, white, tailed, eagles, steller, s, sea, eagles, eastern, imperial, eagles, and, gyrfalcons, because, they, are, potentially, hazardous, prey, for, raptorial, birds, raptors, must, usually, take, them, by, surprise, and, most, attacks, are, on, fledgling, ravens, more, rarely, still, large, mammalian, predators, such, as, lynxes, coyotes, and, cougars, have, also, attacked, ravens, this, principally, occurs, at, a, nest, site, and, when, other, prey, for, the, carnivores, are, scarce, ravens, are, highly, wary, around, novel, carrion, sites, and, in, north, america, have, been, recorded, waiting, for, the, presence, of, american, crows, and, blue, jays, before, approaching, to, eat, juveniles, begin, to, court, at, a, very, early, age, but, may, not, bond, for, another, two, or, three, years, aerial, acrobatics, demonstrations, of, intelligence, and, ability, to, provide, food, are, key, behaviours, of, courting, once, paired, they, tend, to, nest, together, for, life, usually, in, the, same, location, instances, of, non, monogamy, have, been, observed, in, common, ravens, by, males, visiting, a, female, s, nest, when, her, mate, is, away, breeding, pairs, must, have, a, territory, of, their, own, before, they, begin, nest, building, and, reproduction, and, thus, they, aggressively, defend, a, territory, and, its, food, resources, nesting, territories, vary, in, size, according, to, the, density, of, food, resources, in, the, area, the, nest, is, a, deep, bowl, made, of, large, sticks, and, twigs, bound, with, an, inner, layer, of, roots, mud, and, bark, and, lined, with, a, softer, material, such, as, deer, fur, the, nest, is, usually, placed, in, a, large, tree, or, on, a, cliff, ledge, or, less, frequently, in, old, buildings, or, utility, poles, females, lay, between, three, and, seven, pale, bluish, green, brown, blotched, eggs, incubation, is, about, 18, to, 21, days, by, the, female, only, the, male, may, stand, or, crouch, over, the, young, sheltering, but, not, actually, brooding, them, young, fledge, at, 35, to, 42, days, and, are, fed, by, both, parents, they, stay, with, their, parents, for, another, six, months, after, fledging, in, most, of, their, range, egg, laying, begins, in, late, february, but, it, can, be, as, late, as, april, in, colder, climates, such, as, greenland, and, tibet, in, pakistan, egg, laying, takes, place, in, december, eggs, and, hatchlings, are, preyed, on, rarely, by, large, hawks, and, eagles, large, owls, martens, and, canids, the, adults, which, are, very, rarely, preyed, upon, are, often, successful, in, defending, their, young, from, these, predators, due, to, their, numbers, large, size, and, cunning, they, have, been, observed, dropping, stones, on, potential, predators, that, venture, close, to, their, nests, common, ravens, can, be, very, long, lived, especially, in, captive, or, protected, conditions, individuals, at, the, tower, of, london, have, lived, for, more, than, 40, years, their, lifespans, in, the, wild, are, shorter, typically, 10, to, 15, years, the, longest, known, lifespan, of, a, banded, wild, common, raven, was, 23, years, 3, months, which, among, passerines, only, is, surpassed, by, a, few, australian, species, such, as, the, satin, bowerbird, common, ravens, are, omnivorous, and, highly, opportunistic, their, diet, may, vary, widely, with, location, season, and, serendipity, for, example, those, foraging, on, tundra, on, the, arctic, north, slope, of, alaska, obtained, about, half, their, energy, needs, from, predation, mainly, of, microtine, rodents, and, half, by, scavenging, mainly, of, caribou, and, ptarmigan, carcasses, in, some, places, they, are, mainly, scavengers, feeding, on, carrion, as, well, as, the, associated, maggots, and, carrion, beetles, with, large, bodied, carrion, which, they, are, not, equipped, to, tear, through, as, well, as, birds, such, as, hook, billed, vultures, they, must, wait, for, the, prey, to, be, torn, open, by, another, predator, or, flayed, by, other, means, they, are, also, known, to, eat, the, afterbirth, of, ewes, and, other, large, mammals, plant, food, includes, cereal, grains, acorns, buds, berries, and, fruit, they, prey, on, small, invertebrates, amphibians, reptiles, small, mammals, and, birds, ravens, may, also, consume, the, undigested, portions, of, animal, feces, and, human, food, waste, they, store, surplus, food, items, especially, those, containing, fat, and, will, learn, to, hide, such, food, out, of, the, sight, of, other, common, ravens, ravens, also, raid, the, food, caches, of, other, species, such, as, the, arctic, fox, they, sometimes, associate, with, another, canine, the, grey, wolf, as, a, kleptoparasite, following, to, scavenge, wolf, kills, in, winter, ravens, are, regular, predators, at, bird, nests, brazenly, picking, off, eggs, nestlings, and, sometimes, adult, birds, when, they, spot, an, opportunity, they, are, considered, perhaps, the, primary, natural, threat, to, the, nesting, success, of, the, critically, endangered, california, condor, since, they, readily, take, condor, eggs, and, are, very, common, in, the, areas, where, the, species, is, being, re, introduced, on, the, other, hand, when, they, defend, their, own, adjacent, nests, they, may, incidentally, benefit, condors, since, they, chase, golden, eagles, out, of, the, area, that, may, otherwise, prey, upon, larger, nestling, and, fledging, condors, although, condors, recognize, ravens, as, threats, and, will, chase, them, away, their, usual, nest, sites, are, poorly, concealed, from, ravens, the, reason, is, unknown, but, it, may, be, a, holdover, from, times, when, condor, populations, were, denser, nest, sites, more, limiting, and, ravens, less, abundant, common, ravens, nesting, near, sources, of, human, garbage, included, a, higher, percentage, of, food, waste, in, their, diet, birds, nesting, near, roads, consumed, more, road, killed, vertebrates, and, those, nesting, far, from, these, sources, of, food, ate, more, arthropods, and, plant, material, fledging, success, was, higher, for, those, using, human, garbage, as, a, food, source, in, contrast, a, 1984, 1986, study, of, common, raven, diet, in, an, agricultural, region, of, southwestern, idaho, found, that, cereal, grains, were, the, principal, constituent, of, pellets, though, small, mammals, grasshoppers, cattle, carrion, and, birds, were, also, eaten, one, behaviour, is, recruitment, where, juvenile, ravens, call, other, ravens, to, a, food, bonanza, usually, a, carcass, with, a, series, of, loud, yells, in, ravens, in, winter, bernd, heinrich, posited, that, this, behaviour, evolved, to, allow, the, juveniles, to, outnumber, the, resident, adults, thus, allowing, them, to, feed, on, the, carcass, without, being, chased, away, a, more, mundane, explanation, is, that, individuals, co, operate, in, sharing, information, about, carcasses, of, large, mammals, because, they, are, too, big, for, just, a, few, birds, to, exploit, experiments, with, baits, however, show, that, such, recruitment, behaviour, is, independent, of, the, size, of, the, bait, furthermore, there, has, been, research, suggesting, that, the, common, raven, is, involved, in, seed, dispersal, in, the, wild, the, common, raven, chooses, the, best, habitat, and, disperses, seeds, in, locations, best, suited, for, its, survival, the, brain, of, the, common, raven, is, among, the, largest, of, any, bird, species, specifically, their, hyperpallium, is, large, for, a, bird, they, display, ability, in, problem, solving, as, well, as, other, cognitive, processes, such, as, imitation, and, insight, linguist, derek, bickerton, building, on, the, work, of, biologist, bernd, heinrich, has, argued, that, ravens, are, one, of, only, four, known, animals, the, others, being, bees, ants, and, humans, who, have, demonstrated, displacement, the, capacity, to, communicate, about, objects, or, events, that, are, distant, in, space, or, time, subadult, ravens, roost, together, at, night, but, usually, forage, alone, during, the, day, however, when, one, discovers, a, large, carcass, guarded, by, a, pair, of, adult, ravens, the, unmated, raven, will, return, to, the, roost, and, communicate, the, find, the, following, day, a, flock, of, unmated, ravens, will, fly, to, the, carcass, and, chase, off, the, adults, bickerton, argues, that, the, advent, of, linguistic, displacement, was, perhaps, the, most, important, event, in, the, evolution, of, human, language, and, that, ravens, are, the, only, other, vertebrate, to, share, this, with, humans, one, experiment, designed, to, evaluate, insight, and, problem, solving, ability, involved, a, piece, of, meat, attached, to, a, string, hanging, from, a, perch, to, reach, the, food, the, bird, needed, to, stand, on, the, perch, pull, the, string, up, a, little, at, a, time, and, step, on, the, loops, to, gradually, shorten, the, string, four, of, five, common, ravens, eventually, succeeded, and, the, transition, from, no, success, ignoring, the, food, or, merely, yanking, at, the, string, to, constant, reliable, access, pulling, up, the, meat, occurred, with, no, demonstrable, trial, and, error, learning, this, supports, the, hypothesis, that, common, ravens, are, inventors, implying, that, they, can, solve, problems, many, of, the, feats, of, common, ravens, were, formerly, argued, to, be, stereotyped, innate, behaviour, but, it, now, has, been, established, that, their, aptitudes, for, solving, problems, individually, and, learning, from, each, other, reflect, a, flexible, capacity, for, intelligent, insight, unusual, among, non, human, animals, another, experiment, showed, that, some, common, ravens, could, intentionally, deceive, their, conspecifics, a, study, published, in, 2011, found, that, ravens, can, recognise, when, they, are, given, an, unfair, trade, during, reciprocal, interactions, with, conspecifics, or, humans, retaining, memory, of, the, interaction, for, a, prolonged, period, of, time, birds, that, were, given, a, fair, trade, by, experimenters, were, found, to, prefer, interacting, with, these, experimenters, compared, to, those, that, did, not, furthermore, ravens, in, the, wild, have, also, been,
