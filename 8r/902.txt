see, classification, anthocerotae, hornworts, are, a, group, of, non, vascular, embryophytes, land, plants, constituting, the, division, anthocerotophyta, n, o, s, r, t, f, t, t, f, a, t, the, common, name, refers, to, the, elongated, horn, like, structure, which, is, the, sporophyte, as, in, mosses, and, liverworts, hornworts, have, a, gametophyte, dominant, life, cycle, in, which, cells, of, the, plant, carry, only, a, single, set, of, genetic, information, the, flattened, green, plant, body, of, a, hornwort, is, the, gametophyte, stage, of, the, plant, hornworts, may, be, found, worldwide, though, they, tend, to, grow, only, in, places, that, are, damp, or, humid, some, species, grow, in, large, numbers, as, tiny, weeds, in, the, soil, of, gardens, and, cultivated, fields, large, tropical, and, sub, tropical, species, of, dendroceros, may, be, found, growing, on, the, bark, of, trees, the, total, number, of, species, is, still, uncertain, while, there, are, more, than, 300, published, species, names, the, actual, number, could, be, as, low, as, 100, 150, species, like, all, bryophytes, the, dominant, life, phase, of, a, hornwort, is, the, haploid, gametophyte, this, stage, usually, grows, as, a, thin, rosette, or, ribbon, like, thallus, between, one, and, five, centimeters, in, diameter, hornworts, have, lost, two, plastid, division, associated, genes, arc3, and, ftsz2, and, have, just, a, single, chloroplast, per, cell, monoplastidy, with, the, exception, of, the, genus, megaceros, and, some, species, in, the, genera, nothoceros, and, anthoceros, which, have, more, than, one, chloroplast, per, cell, polyplastidy, in, the, polyplastidic, species, and, also, some, of, the, monoplastidic, species, a, cellular, structure, called, a, pyrenoid, is, absent, the, pyrenoid, which, is, both, a, food, storing, organ, and, enables, a, more, efficient, photosynthesis, has, evolved, independently, five, to, six, times, in, hornworts, and, is, present, in, half, of, the, roughly, 200, species, it, is, formed, by, the, fusion, of, the, chloroplast, with, other, organelles, and, is, composed, predominantly, of, rubisco, the, key, enzyme, in, carbon, fixation, by, using, inorganic, carbon, transporters, and, carbonic, anhydrases, up, to, a, 50, fold, increase, in, co, 2, levels, can, be, achieved, this, particular, feature, is, very, unusual, in, land, plants, unique, to, hornworts, but, is, common, among, algae, they, are, also, the, only, group, of, land, plants, where, flavonoids, are, completely, absent, many, hornworts, develop, internal, mucilage, filled, cavities, or, canals, when, groups, of, cells, break, down, these, cavities, secrete, hormogonium, inducing, factors, hif, that, stimulate, nearby, free, living, photosynthetic, cyanobacteria, especially, species, of, nostoc, to, invade, and, colonize, these, cavities, such, colonies, of, bacteria, growing, inside, the, thallus, give, the, hornwort, a, distinctive, blue, green, color, symbiotic, cyanobacteria, have, not, been, reported, in, megaceros, or, folioceros, there, may, also, be, small, slime, pores, on, the, underside, of, the, thallus, these, pores, superficially, resemble, the, stomata, of, other, plants, the, horn, shaped, sporophyte, grows, from, an, archegonium, embedded, deep, in, the, gametophyte, the, growth, of, the, hornwort, sporophyte, happens, from, a, persistent, basal, meristem, in, contrast, to, the, sporophyte, of, moss, apical, growth, and, liverworts, intercalary, growth, unlike, liverworts, hornworts, have, true, stomata, on, their, sporophyte, as, most, mosses, do, the, exceptions, are, the, species, folioceros, incurvus, the, genus, notothylas, and, the, three, closely, related, genera, megaceros, nothoceros, and, dendroceros, which, do, not, have, stomata, notothylas, also, differ, from, other, hornworts, in, having, a, reduced, sporophyte, only, a, few, millimeters, tall, the, sporophyte, in, hornworts, is, unique, among, bryophytes, in, being, long, lived, with, a, persistent, photosynthetic, capacity, the, sporophyte, lacks, an, apical, meristem, an, auxin, sensitive, point, of, divergence, with, other, land, plants, some, time, in, the, late, silurian, early, devonian, when, the, sporophyte, is, mature, it, has, a, multicellular, outer, layer, a, central, rod, like, columella, running, up, the, center, and, a, layer, of, tissue, in, between, that, produces, spores, and, pseudo, elaters, the, pseudo, elaters, are, multi, cellular, unlike, the, elaters, of, liverworts, they, have, helical, thickenings, that, change, shape, in, response, to, drying, out, they, twist, and, thereby, help, to, disperse, the, spores, hornwort, spores, are, relatively, large, for, bryophytes, measuring, between, 30, and, 80, m, in, diameter, or, more, the, spores, are, polar, usually, with, a, distinctive, y, shaped, tri, radiate, ridge, on, the, proximal, surface, and, with, a, distal, surface, ornamented, with, bumps, or, spines, the, life, of, a, hornwort, starts, from, a, haploid, spore, the, spores, can, be, yellow, brown, or, green, yellow, and, brown, spores, have, a, thicker, wall, and, contain, oils, that, both, protect, against, desiccation, and, function, as, a, nutrient, storage, allowing, them, to, survive, for, years, the, species, folioceros, fuciformis, and, the, genera, megaceros, nothoceros, and, dendroceros, have, short, lived, spores, with, thin, and, colorless, walls, that, appear, green, due, to, the, presence, of, a, chloroplast, in, most, species, there, is, a, single, cell, inside, the, spore, and, a, slender, extension, of, this, cell, called, the, germ, tube, germinates, from, the, proximal, side, of, the, spore, the, tip, of, the, germ, tube, divides, to, form, an, octant, solid, geometry, of, cells, and, the, first, rhizoid, grows, as, an, extension, of, the, original, germ, cell, the, tip, continues, to, divide, new, cells, which, produces, a, thalloid, protonema, by, contrast, species, of, the, family, dendrocerotaceae, may, begin, dividing, within, the, spore, becoming, multicellular, and, even, photosynthetic, before, the, spore, germinates, in, either, case, the, protonema, is, a, transitory, stage, in, the, life, of, a, hornwort, from, the, protonema, grows, the, adult, gametophyte, which, is, the, persistent, and, independent, stage, in, the, life, cycle, this, stage, usually, grows, as, a, thin, rosette, or, ribbon, like, thallus, between, one, and, five, centimeters, in, diameter, and, several, layers, of, cells, in, thickness, it, is, green, or, yellow, green, from, the, chlorophyll, in, its, cells, or, bluish, green, when, colonies, of, cyanobacteria, grow, inside, the, plant, when, the, gametophyte, has, grown, to, its, adult, size, it, produces, the, sex, organs, of, the, hornwort, most, plants, are, monoecious, with, both, sex, organs, on, the, same, plant, but, some, plants, even, within, the, same, species, are, dioecious, with, separate, male, and, female, gametophytes, the, female, organs, are, known, as, archegonia, singular, archegonium, and, the, male, organs, are, known, as, antheridia, singular, antheridium, both, kinds, of, organs, develop, just, below, the, surface, of, the, plant, and, are, only, later, exposed, by, disintegration, of, the, overlying, cells, the, biflagellate, sperm, must, swim, from, the, antheridia, or, else, be, splashed, to, the, archegonia, when, this, happens, the, sperm, and, egg, cell, fuse, to, form, a, zygote, the, cell, from, which, the, sporophyte, stage, of, the, life, cycle, will, develop, unlike, all, other, bryophytes, the, first, cell, division, of, the, zygote, is, longitudinal, further, divisions, produce, three, basic, regions, of, the, sporophyte, at, the, bottom, of, the, sporophyte, closest, to, the, interior, of, the, gametophyte, is, a, foot, this, is, a, globular, group, of, cells, that, receives, nutrients, from, the, parent, gametophyte, on, which, the, sporophyte, will, spend, its, entire, existence, in, the, middle, of, the, sporophyte, just, above, the, foot, is, a, meristem, that, will, continue, to, divide, and, produce, new, cells, for, the, third, region, this, third, region, is, the, capsule, both, the, central, and, surface, cells, of, the, capsule, are, sterile, but, between, them, is, a, layer, of, cells, that, will, divide, to, produce, pseudo, elaters, and, spores, these, are, released, from, the, capsule, when, it, splits, lengthwise, from, the, tip, while, the, fossil, record, of, crown, group, hornworts, only, begins, in, the, upper, cretaceous, the, lower, devonian, horneophyton, may, represent, a, stem, group, to, the, clade, as, it, possesses, a, sporangium, with, central, columella, not, attached, at, the, roof, however, the, same, form, of, columella, is, also, characteristic, of, basal, moss, groups, such, as, the, sphagnopsida, and, andreaeopsida, and, has, been, interpreted, as, a, character, common, to, all, early, land, plants, with, stomata, the, divergence, between, hornworts, and, setaphyta, mosses, and, liverworts, is, estimated, to, have, occurred, 479, 450, million, years, ago, and, the, last, common, ancestor, of, present, day, hornworts, lived, in, middle, permian, about, 275, million, years, ago, chromosome, scale, genome, sequencing, of, three, hornwort, species, corroborates, that, stomata, evolved, only, once, during, land, plant, evolution, it, also, shows, that, the, three, groups, of, bryophytes, share, a, common, ancestor, that, branched, off, from, the, other, landplants, early, in, evolution, and, that, liverworts, and, mosses, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, hornworts, unlike, other, land, plants, the, hornwort, genome, has, the, low, co, 2, inducible, b, gene, lcib, which, is, also, found, in, some, species, of, algae, because, the, diffusion, rate, of, carbon, dioxide, is, 10, 000, fold, higher, in, air, than, in, water, aquatic, algae, require, a, mechanism, to, concentrate, co, 2, in, chloroplasts, so, as, to, allow, the, photosynthetic, rubisco, protein, to, function, efficiently, lcib, is, one, component, of, this, co, 2, concentrating, mechanism, hornworts, were, traditionally, considered, a, class, within, the, division, bryophyta, bryophytes, later, on, the, bryophytes, were, considered, paraphyletic, and, hence, the, hornworts, were, given, their, own, division, anthocerotophyta, sometimes, misspelled, anthocerophyta, however, the, most, recent, phylogenetic, evidence, leans, strongly, towards, bryophyte, monophyly, and, it, has, been, proposed, that, hornworts, are, de, ranked, to, the, original, class, anthocerotopsida, traditionally, there, was, a, single, class, of, hornworts, called, anthocerotopsida, or, older, anthocerotae, more, recently, a, second, class, leiosporocertotopsida, has, been, segregated, for, the, singularly, unusual, species, leiosporoceros, dussii, all, other, hornworts, remain, in, the, class, anthocerotopsida, these, two, classes, are, divided, further, into, five, orders, each, containing, a, single, family, among, land, plants, hornworts, are, one, of, the, earliest, diverging, lineages, of, the, early, land, plant, ancestors, cladistic, analysis, implies, that, the, group, originated, prior, to, the, devonian, around, the, same, time, as, the, mosses, and, liverworts, there, are, about, 200, species, known, but, new, species, are, still, being, discovered, the, number, and, names, of, genera, are, a, current, matter, of, investigation, and, several, competing, classification, schemes, have, been, published, since, 1988, structural, features, that, have, been, used, in, the, classification, of, hornworts, include, the, anatomy, of, chloroplasts, and, their, numbers, within, cells, the, presence, of, a, pyrenoid, the, numbers, of, antheridia, within, androecia, and, the, arrangement, of, jacket, cells, of, the, antheridia, recent, studies, of, molecular, ultrastructural, and, morphological, data, have, yielded, a, new, classification, of, hornworts, class, leiosporocerotopsida, class, anthocerotopsida, leiosporoceros, folioceros, sphaerosporoceros, anthoceros, notothylas, phaeoceros, phymatoceros, phaeomegaceros, nothoceros, megaceros, dendroceros
