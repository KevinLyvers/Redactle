see, text, eagle, is, the, common, name, for, the, golden, eagle, bald, eagle, and, other, birds, of, prey, in, the, family, of, the, accipitridae, eagles, belong, to, several, groups, of, genera, some, of, which, are, closely, related, true, eagles, comprise, the, genus, aquila, most, of, the, 68, species, of, eagles, are, from, eurasia, and, africa, outside, this, area, just, 14, species, can, be, found, two, in, north, america, nine, in, central, and, south, america, and, three, in, australia, eagles, are, not, a, natural, group, but, denote, essentially, any, kind, of, bird, of, prey, large, enough, to, hunt, sizeable, about, 50, cm, long, or, more, overall, vertebrates, the, word, eagle, is, borrowed, into, english, from, anglo, norman, eagle, and, middle, french, aigle, both, derived, ultimately, from, latin, aquila, eagle, it, is, cognate, with, terms, such, as, french, aigle, portuguese, guia, and, spanish, guila, it, is, broadly, synonymous, with, the, less, common, english, term, erne, or, earn, deriving, from, middle, english, ern, from, old, english, earn, in, which, it, acts, as, the, usual, word, for, the, bird, the, old, english, term, is, turn, derived, from, proto, germanic, arnuz, and, is, cognate, with, other, synonymous, words, in, germanic, languages, such, as, swedish, rn, german, aar, and, gothic, ara, through, the, proto, indo, european, root, it, is, further, related, to, words, such, as, greek, bird, and, lithuanian, erelis, eagle, although, erne, can, be, used, to, refer, to, any, eagle, it, is, most, commonly, used, for, the, golden, eagle, or, sea, eagle, eagles, are, large, powerfully, built, birds, of, prey, with, heavy, heads, and, beaks, even, the, smallest, eagles, such, as, the, booted, eagle, hieraaetus, pennatus, which, is, comparable, in, size, to, a, common, buzzard, buteo, buteo, or, red, tailed, hawk, b, jamaicensis, have, relatively, longer, and, more, evenly, broad, wings, and, more, direct, faster, flight, despite, the, reduced, size, of, their, aerodynamic, feathers, most, eagles, are, larger, than, any, other, raptors, apart, from, some, vultures, the, smallest, species, of, eagle, is, the, great, nicobar, serpent, eagle, spilornis, klossi, at, 450, g, 1, lb, and, 40, cm, 16, in, the, largest, species, are, discussed, below, like, all, birds, of, prey, eagles, have, very, large, hooked, beaks, for, ripping, flesh, from, their, prey, strong, muscular, legs, and, powerful, talons, the, beak, is, typically, heavier, than, that, of, most, other, birds, of, prey, eagles, eyes, are, extremely, powerful, it, is, estimated, that, the, wedge, tailed, eagle, has, a, visual, acuity, twice, that, of, a, typical, human, this, acuity, enables, eagles, to, spot, potential, prey, from, a, very, long, distance, this, keen, eyesight, is, primarily, attributed, to, their, extremely, large, pupils, which, ensure, minimal, diffraction, scattering, of, the, incoming, light, like, most, diurnal, raptors, eagles, have, little, ability, to, see, ultraviolet, light, the, female, of, all, known, species, of, eagles, is, larger, than, the, male, eagles, normally, build, their, nests, called, eyries, in, tall, trees, or, on, high, cliffs, many, species, lay, two, eggs, but, the, older, larger, chick, frequently, kills, its, younger, sibling, once, it, has, hatched, the, parents, take, no, action, to, stop, the, killing, it, is, said, that, eagles, fly, above, clouds, but, this, is, not, true, eagles, fly, during, storms, and, glide, from, the, wind, s, pressure, this, saves, the, bird, s, energy, due, to, the, size, and, power, of, many, eagle, species, they, are, ranked, at, the, top, of, the, food, chain, as, apex, predators, in, the, avian, world, the, type, of, prey, varies, by, genus, the, haliaeetus, and, icthyophaga, eagles, prefer, to, capture, fish, though, the, species, in, the, former, often, capture, various, animals, especially, other, water, birds, and, are, powerful, kleptoparasites, of, other, birds, the, snake, and, serpent, eagles, of, the, genera, circaetus, terathopius, and, spilornis, predominantly, prey, on, the, great, diversity, of, snakes, found, in, the, tropics, of, africa, and, asia, the, eagles, of, the, genus, aquila, are, often, the, top, birds, of, prey, in, open, habitats, taking, almost, any, medium, sized, vertebrate, they, can, catch, where, aquila, eagles, are, absent, other, eagles, such, as, the, buteonine, black, chested, buzzard, eagle, of, south, america, may, assume, the, position, of, top, raptorial, predator, in, open, areas, many, other, eagles, including, the, species, rich, genus, spizaetus, live, predominantly, in, woodlands, and, forests, these, eagles, often, target, various, arboreal, or, ground, dwelling, mammals, and, birds, which, are, often, unsuspectingly, ambushed, in, such, dense, knotty, environments, hunting, techniques, differ, among, the, species, and, genera, with, some, individual, eagles, having, engaged, in, quite, varied, techniques, based, on, their, environment, and, prey, at, any, given, time, most, eagles, grab, prey, without, landing, and, take, flight, with, it, so, the, prey, can, be, carried, to, a, perch, and, torn, apart, the, bald, eagle, is, noted, for, having, flown, with, the, heaviest, load, verified, to, be, carried, by, any, flying, bird, since, one, eagle, flew, with, a, 6, 8, kg, 15, lb, mule, deer, fawn, however, a, few, eagles, may, target, prey, considerably, heavier, than, themselves, such, prey, is, too, heavy, to, fly, with, thus, it, is, either, eaten, at, the, site, of, the, kill, or, taken, in, pieces, back, to, a, perch, or, nest, golden, and, crowned, eagles, have, killed, ungulates, weighing, up, to, 30, kg, 66, lb, and, a, martial, eagle, even, killed, a, 37, kg, 82, lb, duiker, 7, 8, times, heavier, than, the, preying, eagle, authors, on, birds, david, allen, sibley, pete, dunne, and, clay, sutton, described, the, behavioral, difference, between, hunting, eagles, and, other, birds, of, prey, thus, in, this, case, the, bald, and, golden, eagles, as, compared, to, other, north, american, raptors, they, have, at, least, one, singular, characteristic, it, has, been, observed, that, most, birds, of, prey, look, back, over, their, shoulders, before, striking, prey, or, shortly, thereafter, predation, is, after, all, a, two, edged, sword, all, hawks, seem, to, have, this, habit, from, the, smallest, kestrel, to, the, largest, ferruginous, but, not, the, eagles, among, the, eagles, are, some, of, the, largest, birds, of, prey, only, the, condors, and, some, of, the, old, world, vultures, are, markedly, larger, it, is, regularly, debated, which, should, be, considered, the, largest, species, of, eagle, they, could, be, measured, variously, in, total, length, body, mass, or, wingspan, different, lifestyle, needs, among, various, eagles, result, in, variable, measurements, from, species, to, species, for, example, many, forest, dwelling, eagles, including, the, very, large, harpy, eagle, have, relatively, short, wingspans, a, feature, necessary, for, being, able, to, maneuver, in, quick, short, bursts, through, densely, forested, habitats, eagles, in, the, genus, aquila, found, almost, exclusively, in, open, country, are, noted, for, their, ability, to, soar, and, have, relatively, long, wings, for, their, size, these, lists, of, the, top, five, eagles, are, based, on, weight, length, and, wingspan, respectively, unless, otherwise, noted, by, reference, the, figures, listed, are, the, median, reported, for, each, measurement, in, the, guide, raptors, of, the, world, in, which, only, measurements, that, could, be, personally, verified, by, the, authors, were, listed, the, eagles, are, generally, distributed, in, all, types, of, habitats, and, nearly, all, parts, of, the, world, the, birds, can, be, found, in, northern, tundra, to, tropical, rainforests, and, deserts, in, north, america, bald, eagles, and, golden, eagles, are, very, common, eagles, are, often, informally, divided, into, four, groups, the, snake, eagles, are, placed, in, the, subfamily, circaetinae, the, fish, eagles, booted, eagles, and, harpy, eagles, have, traditionally, been, placed, in, the, subfamily, buteoninae, together, with, the, buzzard, hawks, buteonine, hawks, and, harriers, some, authors, may, treat, these, groups, as, tribes, of, the, buteoninae, lerner, mindell, proposed, separating, the, eagle, groups, into, their, own, subfamilies, of, accipitridae, sea, eagles, or, fish, eagles, take, fish, as, a, large, part, of, their, diets, either, fresh, or, as, carrion, proposed, subfamily, haliaeetinae, genera, haliaeetus, icthyophaga, some, authors, include, gypohierax, angolensis, the, vulturine, fish, eagle, also, called, the, palm, nut, vulture, in, this, group, however, genetic, analyses, indicate, it, is, related, to, a, grouping, of, neophron, gypaetus, eutriorchis, egyptian, vulture, bearded, vulture, lammergeier, and, madagascar, serpent, eagle, the, fish, eagles, have, a, close, genetic, relationship, with, haliastur, and, milvus, the, whole, group, is, only, distantly, related, to, the, buteo, group, fish, eagles, exist, in, every, continent, throughout, the, world, except, for, south, america, although, fish, eagles, can, be, found, in, many, different, places, around, the, world, they, have, been, classified, as, near, threatened, reasons, such, as, overfishing, pollution, habitat, destruction, and, the, use, of, pesticides, have, contributed, to, the, species, rapid, population, drop, the, booted, eagle, is, a, group, of, eagle, that, typically, migrates, across, the, sahara, desert, to, europe, it, usually, reaches, europe, around, the, beginning, of, march, and, leaves, by, the, end, of, september, it, s, interesting, to, note, that, these, types, of, eagles, usually, mate, with, the, same, partner, and, return, to, the, same, areas, years, later, female, booted, eagles, usually, lay, 1, 4, eggs, which, promptly, hatch, after, 37, to, 40, days, researchers, estimate, that, there, are, between, 3600, to, 6900, pairs, of, booted, eagles, in, europe, which, are, mostly, situated, in, the, iberian, peninsula, booted, eagles, or, true, eagles, have, feathered, tarsi, lower, legs, tribe, aquililae, or, proposed, subfamily, aquilinae, genera, aquila, hieraaetus, spizaetus, oroaetus, spizastur, nisaetus, ictinaetus, lophoaetus, polemaetus, and, stephanoaetus, see, comments, under, eagle, species, for, changes, to, the, composition, of, these, genera, most, snake, or, serpent, eagles, as, the, name, suggests, primarily, prey, on, snakes, despite, filling, the, niche, of, a, snake, eagle, genetic, studies, suggest, that, the, madagascar, serpent, eagle, eutriorchis, is, not, related, to, them, over, several, decades, a, great, deal, of, research, has, been, done, on, the, snake, eagle, s, diet, which, is, mainly, made, up, of, reptiles, especially, snakes, when, it, comes, to, catching, snakes, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, bird, exhibits, generalist, feeding, behavior, which, means, it, does, not, hunt, down, specific, types, of, snakes, but, rather, feeds, on, them, depending, on, their, availability, in, the, wild, harpy, eagles, or, giant, forest, eagles, are, large, eagles, that, inhabit, tropical, forests, the, group, contains, two, to, six, species, depending, on, the, author, although, these, birds, occupy, similar, niches, and, have, traditionally, been, grouped, they, are, not, all, related, the, solitary, eagles, are, related, to, the, black, hawks, and, the, philippine, eagle, to, the, snake, eagles, major, new, research, into, eagle, taxonomy, suggests, that, the, important, genera, aquila, and, hieraaetus, are, not, composed, of, nearest, relatives, and, it, is, likely, that, a, reclassification, of, these, genera, will, soon, take, place, with, some, species, being, moved, to, lophaetus, or, ictinaetus, family, accipitridae, the, modern, english, term, for, the, bird, is, derived, from, latin, aquila, by, way, of, french, aigle, the, origin, of, aquila, is, unknown, but, it, is, believed, to, possibly, derive, from, aquilus, meaning, dark, colored, swarthy, or, blackish, as, a, reference, to, the, plumage, of, eagles, old, english, used, the, term, earn, related, to, scandinavia, s, rn, rn, it, is, similar, to, other, indo, european, terms, for, bird, or, eagle, including, greek, orn, s, russian, or, l, and, welsh, eryr, in, the, southern, part, of, finland, near, the, gulf, of, finland, is, the, town, of, kotka, which, literally, means, eagle, while, the, town, of, l, aquila, in, the, central, part, of, italy, literally, means, the, eagle, in, britain, before, 1678, eagle, referred, specifically, to, the, golden, eagle, with, the, other, native, species, the, white, tailed, eagle, being, known, as, erne, the, modern, name, golden, eagle, for, aquila, chrysaetos, was, introduced, by, the, naturalist, john, ray, the, village, of, eagle, in, lincolnshire, england, has, nothing, to, do, with, the, bird, its, name, is, derived, from, the, old, english, words, for, oak, and, wood, compare, oakley, in, the, ancient, sumerian, mythology, the, mythical, king, etana, was, said, to, have, been, carried, into, heaven, by, an, eagle, classical, writers, such, as, lucan, and, pliny, the, elder, claimed, that, the, eagle, was, able, to, look, directly, at, the, sun, and, that, they, forced, their, fledglings, to, do, the, same, those, that, blinked, would, be, cast, from, the, nest, this, belief, persisted, until, the, medieval, era, the, eagle, is, the, patron, animal, of, the, ancient, greek, god, zeus, in, particular, zeus, was, said, to, have, taken, the, form, of, an, eagle, in, order, to, abduct, ganymede, and, there, are, numerous, artistic, depictions, of, the, eagle, zeus, bearing, ganymede, aloft, from, classical, times, up, to, the, present, see, illustrations, in, the, ganymede, mythology, page, eagles, appear, metaphorically, in, many, translations, of, the, old, testament, god, is, spoken, of, as, carrying, israel, on, eagles, wings, in, exodus, 19, 4, isaiah, 40, 31, compares, those, who, wait, on, the, lord, to, flying, eagles, and, psalm, 103, mentions, renewing, one, s, youth, as, the, eagle, in, explaining, this, rejuvenation, augustine, of, hippo, says, in, his, commentary, on, the, psalms, that, eagles, beaks, overgrow, as, they, age, and, that, they, break, them, against, rocks, to, restore, them, the, translation, however, is, uncertain, the, word, in, the, hebrew, can, also, be, translated, vulture, and, is, listed, alongside, specific, kinds, of, vulture, in, leviticus, discussion, of, unclean, animals, the, eagle, is, also, often, used, in, christian, iconography, to, represent, the, gospel, of, john, and, eagle, shaped, lecterns, are, common, in, anglican, and, some, roman, catholic, churches, the, eagle, was, believed, to, be, able, to, look, directly, into, the, sun, in, the, same, way, that, the, gospel, of, john, looks, directly, at, jesus, divinity, and, the, great, distances, the, eagle, flies, represent, the, spread, of, the, gospel, to, the, ends, of, the, earth, the, united, states, eagle, feather, law, stipulates, that, only, individuals, of, certifiable, native, american, ancestry, enrolled, in, a, federally, recognized, tribe, are, legally, authorized, to, obtain, eagle, feathers, for, religious, or, spiritual, reasons, in, canada, the, poaching, of, eagle, feathers, for, the, booming, u, s, market, has, sometimes, resulted, in, the, arrests, of, first, nations, person, for, the, crime, the, moche, people, of, ancient, peru, worshiped, the, eagle, and, often, depicted, eagles, in, their, art, the, golden, eagle, was, sacred, to, the, aztec, god, huitzilopochtli, while, the, harpy, eagle, was, sacred, to, quetzalcoatl, eagles, are, an, exceptionally, common, symbol, in, heraldry, being, considered, the, king, of, birds, in, contrast, to, the, lion, the, king, of, beasts, whereas, the, lion, e, g, england, usually, represents, authority, the, eagle, is, the, symbol, of, power, they, are, particularly, popular, in, germanic, countries, such, as, austria, due, to, their, association, with, the, holy, roman, empire, the, eagle, of, the, holy, roman, empire, was, two, headed, supposedly, representing, the, two, divisions, east, and, west, of, the, old, roman, empire, this, motif, derived, from, the, byzantine, eastern, roman, empire, was, also, adopted, by, the, russian, empire, and, is, still, featured, in, the, flag, of, albania, the, roman, eagle, was, preceded, by, the, eagle, of, ptolemaic, egypt, and, the, achaemenid, empire, in, the, coat, of, arms, of, kotka, finland, the, eagle, is, depicted, carrying, an, anchor, and, the, caduceus, on, its, feet, heraldic, eagles, are, most, often, found, displayed, i, e, with, their, wings, and, legs, extended, they, can, also, occur, close, i, e, with, their, wings, folded, or, rising, i, e, about, to, take, flight, the, heads, wings, and, legs, of, eagles, can, also, be, found, independently, eagles, symbolize, strength, courage, and, independence, and, are, commonly, found, in, the, heraldry, of, many, nations, across, the, world, albania, andorra, armenia, austria, dagestan, egypt, germany, ghana, iraq, jordan, kazakhstan, mexico, montenegro, nigeria, philippines, poland, palestine, panama, russia, romania,

significance, and, worldwide, appeal, as, a, forceful, symbol, in, national, identity, and, imagery, is, demonstrated, by, its, widespread, usage
