iguanodon, w, n, d, n, i, gwah, n, don, meaning, iguana, tooth, named, in, 1825, is, a, genus, of, iguanodontian, dinosaur, while, many, species, found, worldwide, have, been, classified, in, the, genus, iguanodon, dating, from, the, late, jurassic, to, early, cretaceous, taxonomic, revision, in, the, early, 21st, century, has, defined, iguanodon, to, be, based, on, one, well, substantiated, species, i, bernissartensis, which, lived, during, the, barremian, to, early, aptian, ages, of, the, early, cretaceous, in, belgium, germany, england, and, spain, between, about, 126, and, 122, million, years, ago, iguanodon, was, a, large, bulky, herbivore, measuring, up, to, 9, 11, metres, 30, 36, ft, in, length, and, 4, 5, metric, tons, 5, 0, short, tons, in, body, mass, distinctive, features, include, large, thumb, spikes, which, were, possibly, used, for, defense, against, predators, combined, with, long, prehensile, fifth, fingers, able, to, forage, for, food, the, genus, was, named, in, 1825, by, english, geologist, gideon, mantell, based, on, fossil, specimens, found, in, england, and, was, given, the, species, name, i, anglicus, iguanodon, was, the, second, type, of, dinosaur, formally, named, based, on, fossil, specimens, after, megalosaurus, together, with, megalosaurus, and, hylaeosaurus, it, was, one, of, the, three, genera, originally, used, to, define, dinosauria, the, genus, iguanodon, belongs, to, the, larger, group, iguanodontia, along, with, the, duck, billed, hadrosaurs, the, taxonomy, of, this, genus, continues, to, be, a, topic, of, study, as, new, species, are, named, or, long, standing, ones, reassigned, to, other, genera, in, 1878, new, far, more, complete, remains, of, iguanodon, were, discovered, in, belgium, and, studied, by, louis, dollo, these, were, given, the, new, species, i, bernissartensis, in, the, early, 21st, century, it, became, understood, that, the, remains, referred, to, as, iguanodon, in, england, belonged, to, four, different, species, including, i, bernissartensis, that, were, not, closely, related, to, each, other, which, were, subsequently, split, off, into, mantellisaurus, barilium, and, hypselospinus, it, was, also, found, that, the, originally, described, type, species, of, iguanodon, i, anglicus, is, now, a, nomen, dubium, and, not, valid, thus, the, name, iguanodon, became, fixed, around, the, well, known, species, based, primarily, on, the, belgian, specimens, in, 2015, a, second, valid, species, i, galvensis, was, named, based, on, fossils, found, in, the, iberian, peninsula, scientific, understanding, of, iguanodon, has, evolved, over, time, as, new, information, has, been, obtained, from, fossils, the, numerous, specimens, of, this, genus, including, nearly, complete, skeletons, from, two, well, known, bone, beds, have, allowed, researchers, to, make, informed, hypotheses, regarding, many, aspects, of, the, living, animal, including, feeding, movement, and, social, behaviour, as, one, of, the, first, scientifically, well, known, dinosaurs, iguanodon, has, occupied, a, small, but, notable, place, in, the, public, s, perception, of, dinosaurs, its, artistic, representation, changing, significantly, in, response, to, new, interpretations, of, its, remains, the, discovery, of, iguanodon, has, long, been, accompanied, by, a, popular, legend, the, story, goes, that, gideon, mantell, s, wife, mary, ann, discovered, the, first, teeth, of, an, iguanodon, in, the, strata, of, tilgate, forest, in, whitemans, green, cuckfield, sussex, england, in, 1822, while, her, husband, was, visiting, a, patient, however, there, is, no, evidence, that, mantell, took, his, wife, with, him, while, seeing, patients, furthermore, he, admitted, in, 1851, that, he, himself, had, found, the, teeth, although, he, had, previously, stated, in, 1827, and, 1833, that, mrs, mantell, had, indeed, found, the, first, of, the, teeth, later, named, iguanodon, other, later, authors, agree, that, the, story, is, not, certainly, false, it, is, known, from, his, notebooks, that, mantell, first, acquired, large, fossil, bones, from, the, quarry, at, whitemans, green, in, 1820, because, also, theropod, teeth, were, found, thus, belonging, to, carnivores, he, at, first, interpreted, these, bones, which, he, tried, to, combine, into, a, partial, skeleton, as, those, of, a, giant, crocodile, in, 1821, mantell, mentioned, the, find, of, herbivorous, teeth, and, began, to, consider, the, possibility, that, a, large, herbivorous, reptile, was, present, in, the, strata, however, in, his, 1822, publication, fossils, of, the, south, downs, he, as, yet, did, not, dare, to, suggest, a, connection, between, the, teeth, and, his, very, incomplete, skeleton, presuming, that, his, finds, presented, two, large, forms, one, carnivorous, an, animal, of, the, lizard, tribe, of, enormous, magnitude, the, other, herbivorous, in, may, 1822, he, first, presented, the, herbivorous, teeth, to, the, royal, society, of, london, but, the, members, among, them, william, buckland, dismissed, them, as, fish, teeth, or, the, incisors, of, a, rhinoceros, from, a, tertiary, stratum, on, 23, june, 1823, charles, lyell, showed, some, to, georges, cuvier, during, a, soiree, in, paris, but, the, famous, french, naturalist, at, once, dismissed, them, as, those, of, a, rhinoceros, though, the, very, next, day, cuvier, retracted, lyell, reported, only, the, dismissal, to, mantell, who, became, rather, diffident, about, the, issue, in, 1824, buckland, described, megalosaurus, and, was, on, that, occasion, invited, to, visit, mantell, s, collection, seeing, the, bones, on, 6, march, he, agreed, that, these, were, of, some, giant, saurian, though, still, denying, it, was, a, herbivore, emboldened, nevertheless, mantell, again, sent, some, teeth, to, cuvier, who, answered, on, 22, june, 1824, that, he, had, determined, that, they, were, reptilian, and, quite, possibly, belonged, to, a, giant, herbivore, in, a, new, edition, that, year, of, his, recherches, sur, les, ossemens, fossiles, cuvier, admitted, his, earlier, mistake, leading, to, an, immediate, acceptance, of, mantell, and, his, new, saurian, in, scientific, circles, mantell, tried, to, corroborate, his, theory, further, by, finding, a, modern, day, parallel, among, extant, reptiles, in, september, 1824, he, visited, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, but, at, first, failed, to, find, comparable, teeth, however, assistant, curator, samuel, stutchbury, recognised, that, they, resembled, those, of, an, iguana, he, had, recently, prepared, albeit, twenty, times, longer, in, recognition, of, the, resemblance, of, the, teeth, to, those, of, the, iguana, mantell, decided, to, name, his, new, animal, iguanodon, or, iguana, tooth, from, iguana, and, the, greek, word, odon, odontos, or, tooth, based, on, isometric, scaling, he, estimated, that, the, creature, might, have, been, up, to, 18, metres, 59, feet, long, more, than, the, 12, metre, 39, ft, length, of, megalosaurus, his, initial, idea, for, a, name, was, iguana, saurus, iguana, lizard, but, his, friend, william, daniel, conybeare, suggested, that, that, name, was, more, applicable, to, the, iguana, itself, so, a, better, name, would, be, iguanoides, iguana, like, or, iguanodon, he, neglected, to, add, a, specific, name, to, form, a, proper, binomial, but, one, was, supplied, in, 1829, by, friedrich, holl, i, anglicum, which, was, later, emended, to, i, anglicus, mantell, sent, a, letter, detailing, his, discovery, to, the, local, portsmouth, philosophical, society, in, december, 1824, several, weeks, after, settling, on, a, name, for, the, fossil, creature, the, letter, was, read, to, members, of, the, society, at, a, meeting, on, 17, december, and, a, report, was, published, in, the, hampshire, telegraph, the, following, monday, 20, december, which, announced, the, name, misspelled, as, iguanadon, mantell, formally, published, his, findings, on, 10, february, 1825, when, he, presented, a, paper, on, the, remains, to, the, royal, society, of, london, a, more, complete, specimen, of, a, similar, animal, was, discovered, in, a, quarry, in, maidstone, kent, in, 1834, lower, lower, greensand, formation, which, mantell, soon, acquired, he, was, led, to, identify, it, as, an, iguanodon, based, on, its, distinctive, teeth, the, maidstone, slab, nhmuk, pv, or, 3791, was, used, in, the, first, skeletal, reconstructions, and, artistic, renderings, of, iguanodon, but, due, to, its, incompleteness, mantell, made, some, mistakes, the, most, famous, of, which, was, the, placement, of, what, he, thought, was, a, horn, on, the, nose, the, discovery, of, much, better, specimens, in, later, years, revealed, that, the, horn, was, actually, a, modified, thumb, still, encased, in, rock, the, maidstone, skeleton, is, currently, displayed, at, the, natural, history, museum, in, london, the, borough, of, maidstone, commemorated, this, find, by, adding, an, iguanodon, as, a, supporter, to, their, coat, of, arms, in, 1949, this, specimen, has, become, linked, with, the, name, i, mantelli, a, species, named, in, 1832, by, christian, erich, hermann, von, meyer, in, place, of, i, anglicus, but, it, actually, comes, from, a, different, formation, than, the, original, i, mantelli, i, anglicus, material, the, maidstone, specimen, also, known, as, gideon, mantell, s, mantel, piece, and, formally, labelled, nhmuk, 3741, was, subsequently, excluded, from, iguanodon, it, is, classified, as, cf, mantellisaurus, by, mcdonald, 2012, as, cf, mantellisaurus, atherfieldensis, by, norman, 2012, and, made, the, holotype, of, a, separate, species, mantellodon, carpenteri, by, paul, 2012, but, this, is, considered, dubious, and, it, is, generally, considered, a, specimen, of, mantellisaurus, at, the, same, time, tension, began, to, build, between, mantell, and, richard, owen, an, ambitious, scientist, with, much, better, funding, and, society, connections, in, the, turbulent, worlds, of, reform, act, era, british, politics, and, science, owen, a, firm, creationist, opposed, the, early, versions, of, evolutionary, science, transmutationism, then, being, debated, and, used, what, he, would, soon, coin, as, dinosaurs, as, a, weapon, in, this, conflict, with, the, paper, describing, dinosauria, he, scaled, down, dinosaurs, from, lengths, of, over, 61, metres, 200, feet, determined, that, they, were, not, simply, giant, lizards, and, put, forward, that, they, were, advanced, and, mammal, like, characteristics, given, to, them, by, god, according, to, the, understanding, of, the, time, they, could, not, have, been, transmuted, from, reptiles, to, mammal, like, creatures, in, 1849, a, few, years, before, his, death, in, 1852, mantell, realised, that, iguanodonts, were, not, heavy, pachyderm, like, animals, as, owen, was, putting, forward, but, had, slender, forelimbs, however, since, his, passing, left, him, unable, to, participate, in, the, creation, of, the, crystal, palace, dinosaur, sculptures, owen, s, vision, of, the, dinosaurs, became, that, seen, by, the, public, for, decades, with, benjamin, waterhouse, hawkins, he, had, nearly, two, dozen, lifesize, sculptures, of, various, prehistoric, animals, built, out, of, concrete, sculpted, over, a, steel, and, brick, framework, two, iguanodonts, based, on, the, maidstone, specimen, one, standing, and, one, resting, on, its, belly, were, included, before, the, sculpture, of, the, standing, iguanodont, was, completed, he, held, a, banquet, for, twenty, inside, it, the, largest, find, of, iguanodon, remains, to, that, date, occurred, on, 28, february, 1878, in, a, coal, mine, at, bernissart, in, belgium, at, a, depth, of, 322, m, 1, 056, ft, when, two, mineworkers, jules, cr, teur, and, alphonse, blanchard, accidentally, hit, on, a, skeleton, that, they, initially, took, for, petrified, wood, with, the, encouragement, of, alphonse, briart, supervisor, of, mines, at, nearby, morlanwelz, louis, de, pauw, on, 15, may, 1878, started, to, excavate, the, skeletons, and, in, 1882, louis, dollo, reconstructed, them, at, least, 38, iguanodon, individuals, were, uncovered, most, of, which, were, adults, in, 1882, the, holotype, specimen, of, i, bernissartensis, became, one, of, the, first, ever, dinosaur, skeletons, mounted, for, display, it, was, put, together, in, a, chapel, at, the, palace, of, charles, of, lorraine, using, a, series, of, adjustable, ropes, attached, to, scaffolding, so, that, a, lifelike, pose, could, be, achieved, during, the, mounting, process, this, specimen, along, with, several, others, first, opened, for, public, viewing, in, an, inner, courtyard, of, the, palace, in, july, 1883, in, 1891, they, were, moved, to, the, royal, museum, of, natural, history, where, they, are, still, on, display, nine, are, displayed, as, standing, mounts, and, nineteen, more, are, still, in, the, museum, s, basement, the, exhibit, makes, an, impressive, display, in, the, royal, belgian, institute, of, natural, sciences, in, brussels, a, replica, of, one, of, these, is, on, display, at, the, oxford, university, museum, of, natural, history, and, at, the, sedgwick, museum, in, cambridge, most, of, the, remains, were, referred, to, a, new, species, i, bernissartensis, a, larger, and, much, more, robust, animal, than, the, english, remains, had, yet, revealed, one, specimen, irsnb, 1551, was, at, first, referred, to, the, nebulous, gracile, i, mantelli, but, is, currently, referred, to, mantellisaurus, atherfieldensis, the, skeletons, were, some, of, the, first, complete, dinosaur, skeletons, known, found, with, the, dinosaur, skeletons, were, the, remains, of, plants, fish, and, other, reptiles, including, the, crocodyliform, bernissartia, the, science, of, conserving, fossil, remains, was, in, its, infancy, and, new, techniques, had, to, be, improvised, to, deal, with, what, soon, became, known, as, pyrite, disease, crystalline, pyrite, in, the, bones, was, being, oxidized, to, iron, sulphate, accompanied, by, an, increase, in, volume, that, caused, the, remains, to, crack, and, crumble, when, in, the, ground, the, bones, were, isolated, by, anoxic, moist, clay, that, prevented, this, from, happening, but, when, removed, into, the, drier, open, air, the, natural, chemical, conversion, began, to, occur, to, limit, this, effect, de, pauw, immediately, in, the, mine, gallery, re, covered, the, dug, out, fossils, with, wet, clay, sealing, them, with, paper, and, plaster, reinforced, by, iron, rings, forming, in, total, about, six, hundred, transportable, blocks, with, a, combined, weight, of, a, hundred, and, thirty, tons, in, brussels, after, opening, the, plaster, he, impregnated, the, bones, with, boiling, gelatine, mixed, with, oil, of, cloves, as, a, preservative, removing, most, of, the, visible, pyrite, he, then, hardened, them, with, hide, glue, finishing, with, a, final, layer, of, tin, foil, damage, was, repaired, with, papier, m, ch, this, treatment, had, the, unintended, effect, of, sealing, in, moisture, and, extending, the, period, of, damage, in, 1932, museum, director, victor, van, straelen, decided, that, the, specimens, had, to, be, completely, restored, again, to, safeguard, their, preservation, from, december, 1935, to, august, 1936, the, staff, at, the, museum, in, brussels, treated, the, problem, with, a, combination, of, alcohol, arsenic, and, 390, kilograms, of, shellac, this, combination, was, intended, to, simultaneously, penetrate, the, fossils, with, alcohol, prevent, the, development, of, mold, with, arsenic, and, harden, them, with, shellac, the, fossils, entered, a, third, round, of, conservation, from, 2003, until, may, 2007, when, the, shellac, hide, glue, and, gelatine, were, removed, and, impregnated, with, polyvinyl, acetate, and, cyanoacrylate, and, epoxy, glues, modern, treatments, of, this, problem, typically, involve, either, monitoring, the, humidity, of, fossil, storage, or, for, fresh, specimens, preparing, a, special, coating, of, polyethylene, glycol, that, is, then, heated, in, a, vacuum, pump, so, that, moisture, is, immediately, removed, and, pore, spaces, are, infiltrated, with, polyethylene, glycol, to, seal, and, strengthen, the, fossil, dollo, s, specimens, allowed, him, to, show, that, owen, s, prehistoric, pachyderms, were, not, correct, for, iguanodon, he, instead, modelled, the, skeletal, mounts, after, the, cassowary, and, wallaby, and, put, the, spike, that, had, been, on, the, nose, firmly, on, the, thumb, his, reconstruction, would, prevail, for, a, long, period, of, time, but, would, later, be, discounted, excavations, at, the, quarry, were, stopped, in, 1881, although, it, was, not, exhausted, of, fossils, as, recent, drilling, operations, have, shown, during, world, war, i, when, the, town, was, occupied, by, german, forces, preparations, were, made, to, reopen, the, mine, for, palaeontology, and, otto, jaekel, was, sent, from, berlin, to, supervise, just, as, the, first, fossiliferous, layer, was, about, to, be, uncovered, however, the, german, army, surrendered, and, had, to, withdraw, further, attempts, to, reopen, the, mine, were, hindered, by, financial, problems, and, were, stopped, altogether, in, 1921, when, the, mine, flooded, research, on, iguanodon, decreased, during, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, as, world, wars, and, the, great, depression, enveloped, europe, a, new, species, that, would, become, the, subject, of, much, study, and, taxonomic, controversy, i, atherfieldensis, was, named, in, 1925, by, r, w, hooley, for, a, specimen, collected, at, atherfield, point, on, the, isle, of, wight, iguanodon, was, not, part, of, the, initial, work, of, the, dinosaur, renaissance, that, began, with, the, description, of, deinonychus, in, 1969, but, it, was, not, neglected, for, long, david, b, weishampel, s, work, on, ornithopod, feeding, mechanisms, provided, a, better, understanding, of, how, it, fed, and, david, b, norman, s, work, on, numerous, aspects, of, the, genus, has, made, it, one, of, the, best, known, dinosaurs, in, addition, a, further, find, of, numerous, disarticulated, iguanodon, bones, in, nehden, nordrhein, westphalen, germany, has, provided, evidence, for, gregariousness, in, this, genus, as, the, animals, in, this, areally, restricted, find, appear, to, have, been, killed, by, flash, floods, at, least, 15, individuals, from, 2, to, 8, metres, 6, ft, 7, in, to, 26, ft, 3, in, long, have, been, found, here, most, of, the, individuals, belong, to, the, related, mantellisaurus, described, as, i, atherfieldensis, at, that, time, believed, to, be, another, species, of, iguanodon, but, some, are, of, i, bernissartensis, one, major, revision, to, iguanodon, brought, by, the, renaissance, would, be, another, re, thinking, of, how, to, reconstruct, the, animal, a, major, flaw, with, dollo, s, reconstruction, was, the, bend, he, introduced, into, the, tail, this, organ, was, more, or, less, straight, as, shown, by, the, skeletons, he, was, excavating, and, the, presence, of, ossified, tendons, in, fact, to, get, the, bend, in, the, tail, for, a, more, wallaby, or, kangaroo, like, posture, the, tail, would, have, had, to, be, broken, with, its, correct, straight, tail, and, back, the, animal, would, have, walked, with, its, body, held, horizontal, to, the, ground, arms, in, place, to, support, the, body, if, needed, in, the, 21st, century, iguanodon, material, has, been, used, in, the, search, for, dinosaur, biomolecules, in, research, by, graham, embery, et, al, iguanodon, bones, were, processed, to, look, for, remnant, proteins, in, this, research, identifiable, remains, of, typical, bone, proteins, such, as, phosphoproteins, and, proteoglycans, were, found, in, a, rib, in, 2007, gregory, s, paul, split, i, atherfieldensis, into, a, new, separate, genus, mantellisaurus, which, has, been, generally, accepted, in, 2009, fragmentary, iguanodontid, material, was, described, from, upper, barremian, paris, basin, deposits, in, auxerre, burgundy, while, not, definitively, diagnosable, to, the, genus, species, level, the, specimen, shares, obvious, morphological, and, dimensional, affinities, with, i, bernissartensis, in, 2010, david, norman, split, the, valanginian, species, i, dawsoni, and, i, fittoni, into, barilium, and, hypselospinus, respectively, after, norman, 2010, over, half, a, dozen, new, genera, were, named, off, english, iguanodon, material, carpenter, and, ishida, in, 2010, named, proplanicoxa, torilion, and, sellacoxa, while, gregory, s, paul, in, 2012, named, darwinsaurus, huxleysaurus, and, mantellodon, and, macdonald, et, al, in, 2012, named, kukufeldia, these, species, named, after, norman, 2010, are, not, considered, valid, and, are, considered, various, junior, synonyms, of, mantellisaurus, barilium, and, hypselospinus, in, 2011, a, new, genus, delapparentia, was, named, for, a, specimen, in, spain, that, was, originally, thought, to, belong, to, i, bernissartensis, the, previous, identification, was, subsequently, reaffirmed, in, a, new, analysis, of, individual, variation, in, the, belgian, specimens, finding, that, the, delapparentia, specimen, was, within, the, range, of, i, bernissartensis, in, 2015, a, new, species, of, iguanodon, i, galvensis, was, named, based, on, material, including, 13, juvenile, perinate, individuals, found, in, the, camarillas, formation, near, galve, spain, in, 2017, a, new, study, was, done, of, i, galvensis, with, further, evidence, of, distinctiveness, from, i, bernissartensis, including, several, new, autapomorphies, it, was, also, found, that, the, delapparentia, holotype, which, is, also, from, the, camarillas, formation, was, not, distinguishable, from, either, i, bernissartensis, or, i, galvensis, iguanodon, were, bulky, herbivores, that, could, shift, from, bipedality, to, quadrupedality, the, only, well, supported, species, i, bernissartensis, is, estimated, to, have, measured, about, 9, metres, 30, feet, long, as, an, adult, with, some, specimens, possibly, as, long, as, 13, metres, 43, feet, although, this, is, likely, an, overestimate, given, that, the, maximum, body, length, of, i, bernissartensis, is, reported, to, be, 11, m, 36, ft, although, gregory, s, paul, suggested, a, body, mass, of, 3, 08, metric, tons, 3, 40, short, tons, on, average, constructing, a, 3d, mathematical, model, and, employing, allometry, based, estimate, suggests, an, i, bernissartensis, close, to, 8, m, 26, ft, long, smaller, than, average, weighs, close, to, 3, 8, metric, tons, 4, 2, short, tons, in, body, mass, specimens, of, relatively, large, individuals, have, been, reported, in, the, 2020s, a, specimen, referred, to, as, i, cf, galvensis, was, measured, up, to, 9, 10, m, 30, 33, ft, in, length, while, a, new, specimen, of, i, bernissartensis, from, the, upper, barremian, of, the, iberian, peninsula, was, measured, up, to, 11, m, 36, ft, in, length, such, large, individuals, would, have, weighed, approximately, 4, 5, metric, tons, 5, 0, short, tons, the, arms, of, i, bernissartensis, were, long, up, to, 75, the, length, of, the, legs, and, robust, with, rather, inflexible, hands, built, so, that, the, three, central, fingers, could, bear, weight, the, thumbs, were, conical, spikes, that, stuck, out, away, from, the, three, main, digits, in, early, restorations, the, spike, was, placed, on, the, animal, s, nose, later, fossils, revealed, the, true, nature, of, the, thumb, spikes, although, their, exact, function, is, still, debated, they, could, have, been, used, for, defense, or, for, foraging, for, food, the, little, finger, was, elongated, and, dextrous, and, could, have, been, used, to, manipulate, objects, the, phalangeal, formula, is, 2, 3, 3, 2, 4, meaning, that, the, innermost, finger, phalange, has, two, bones, the, next, has, three, etc, the, legs, were, powerful, but, not, built, for, running, and, each, foot, had, three, toes, the, backbone, and, tail, were, supported, and, stiffened, by, ossified, tendons, which, were, tendons, that, turned, to, bone, during, life, these, rod, like, bones, are, usually, omitted, from, skeletal, mounts, and, drawings, these, animals, had, large, tall, but, narrow, skulls, with, toothless, beaks, probably, covered, with, keratin, and, teeth, like, those, of, iguanas, as, the, name, suggests, but, much, larger, and, more, closely, packed, unlike, hadrosaurids, which, had, columns, of, replacement, teeth, iguanodon, only, had, one, replacement, tooth, at, a, time, for, each, position, the, upper, jaw, held, up, to, 29, teeth, per, side, with, none, at, the, front, of, the, jaw, and, the, lower, jaw, 25, the, numbers, differ, because, teeth, in, the, lower, jaw, are, broader, than, those, in, the, upper, because, the, tooth, rows, are, deeply, inset, from, the, outside, of, the, jaws, and, because, of, other, anatomical, details, it, is, believed, that, as, with, most, other, ornithischians, iguanodon, had, some, sort, of, cheek, like, structure, muscular, or, non, muscular, to, retain, food, in, the, mouth, iguanodon, gives, its, name, to, the, unranked, clade, iguanodontia, a, very, populous, group, of, ornithopods, with, many, species, known, from, the, middle, jurassic, to, the, late, cretaceous, aside, from, iguanodon, the, best, known, members, of, the, clade, include, dryosaurus, camptosaurus, ouranosaurus, and, the, duck, bills, or, hadrosaurs, in, older, sources, iguanodontidae, was, shown, as, a, distinct, family, this, family, traditionally, has, been, something, of, a, wastebasket, taxon, including, ornithopods, that, were, neither, hypsilophodontids, or, hadrosaurids, in, practice, animals, like, callovosaurus, camptosaurus, craspedodon, kangnasaurus, mochlodon, muttaburrasaurus, ouranosaurus, and, probactrosaurus, were, usually, assigned, to, this, family, with, the, advent, of, cladistic, analyses, iguanodontidae, as, traditionally, construed, was, shown, to, be, paraphyletic, and, these, animals, are, recognised, to, fall, at, different, points, in, relation, to, hadrosaurs, on, a, cladogram, instead, of, in, a, single, distinct, clade, essentially, the, modern, concept, of, iguanodontidae, currently, includes, only, iguanodon, groups, like, iguanodontoidea, are, still, used, as, unranked, clades, in, the, scientific, literature, though, many, traditional, iguanodontids, are, now, included, in, the, superfamily, hadrosauroidea, iguanodon, lies, between, camptosaurus, and, ouranosaurus, in, cladograms, and, is, probably, descended, from, a, camptosaur, like, animal, at, one, point, jack, horner, suggested, based, mostly, on, skull, features, that, hadrosaurids, actually, formed, two, more, distantly, related, groups, with, iguanodon, on, the, line, to, the, flat, headed, hadrosaurines, and, ouranosaurus, on, the, line, to, the, crested, lambeosaurines, but, his, proposal, has, been, rejected, the, cladogram, below, follows, an, analysis, by, andrew, mcdonald, 2012, rhabdodontidae, tenontosaurus, dryosauridae, camptosaurus, uteodon, hippodraco, theiophytalia, iguanacolossus, lanzhousaurus, kukufeldia, barilium, iguanodon, hadrosauroidea, including, mantellisaurus, and, xuwulong, because, iguanodon, is, one, of, the, first, dinosaur, genera, to, have, been, named, numerous, species, have, been, assigned, to, it, while, never, becoming, the, wastebasket, taxon, several, other, early, genera, of, dinosaurs, such, as, megalosaurus, became, iguanodon, has, had, a, complicated, history, and, its, taxonomy, continues, to, undergo, revisions, although, gregory, paul, recommended, restricting, i, bernissartensis, to, the, famous, sample, from, bernissart, ornithopod, workers, like, norman, and, mcdonald, have, disagreed, with, paul, s, recommendations, except, exercising, caution, when, accepting, records, of, iguanodon, from, france, and, spain, as, valid, i, anglicus, was, the, original, type, species, but, the, lectotype, was, based, on, a, single, tooth, and, only, partial, remains, of, the, species, have, been, recovered, since, in, march, 2000, the, international, commission, on, zoological, nomenclature, changed, the, type, species, to, the, much, better, known, i, bernissartensis, with, the, new, holotype, being, irsnb, 1534, the, original, iguanodon, tooth, is, held, at, te, papa, tongarewa, the, national, museum, of, new, zealand, in, wellington, although, it, is, not, on, display, the, fossil, arrived, in, new, zealand, following, the, move, of, gideon, mantell, s, son, walter, there, after, the, elder, mantell, s, death, his, fossils, went, to, walter, only, two, species, assigned, to, iguanodon, are, still, considered, to, be, valid, one, of, the, first, details, noted, about, iguanodon, was, that, it, had, the, teeth, of, a, herbivorous, reptile, although, there, has, not, always, been, consensus, on, how, it, ate, as, mantell, noted, the, remains, he, was, working, with, were, unlike, any, modern, reptile, especially, in, the, toothless, scoop, shaped, form, of, the, lower, jaw, symphysis, which, he, found, best, compared, to, that, of, the, two, toed, sloth, and, the, extinct, ground, sloth, mylodon, he, also, suggested, that, iguanodon, had, a, prehensile, tongue, which, could, be, used, to, gather, food, like, a, giraffe, more, complete, remains, have, shown, this, to, be, an, error, for, example, the, hyoid, bones, that, supported, the, tongue, are, heavily, built, implying, a, muscular, non, prehensile, tongue, used, for, moving, food, around, in, the, mouth, the, giraffe, tongue, idea, has, also, been, incorrectly, attributed, to, dollo, via, a, broken, lower, jaw, the, skull, was, structured, in, such, a, way, that, as, it, closed, the, bones, holding, the, teeth, in, the, upper, jaw, would, bow, out, this, would, cause, the, lower, surfaces, of, the, upper, jaw, teeth, to, rub, against, the, upper, surface, of, the, lower, jaw, s, teeth, grinding, anything, caught, in, between, and, providing, an, action, that, is, the, rough, equivalent, of, mammalian, chewing, because, the, teeth, were, always, replaced, the, animal, could, have, used, this, mechanism, throughout, its, life, and, could, eat, tough, plant, material, additionally, the, front, ends, of, the, animal, s, jaws, were, toothless, and, tipped, with, bony, nodes, both, upper, and, lower, providing, a, rough, margin, that, was, likely, covered, and, lengthened, by, a, keratinous, material, to, form, a, cropping, beak, for, biting, off, twigs, and, shoots, its, food, gathering, would, have, been, aided, by, its, flexible, little, finger, which, could, have, been, used, to, manipulate, objects, unlike, the, other, fingers, exactly, what, iguanodon, ate, with, its, well, developed, jaws, is, not, known, the, size, of, the, larger, species, such, as, i, bernissartensis, would, have, allowed, them, access, to, food, from, ground, level, to, tree, foliage, at, 4, 5, metres, 13, 16, ft, high, a, diet, of, horsetails, cycads, and, conifers, was, suggested, by, david, norman, although, iguanodonts, in, general, have, been, tied, to, the, advance, of, angiosperm, plants, in, the, cretaceous, due, to, the, dinosaurs, inferred, low, browsing, habits, angiosperm, growth, according, to, this, hypothesis, would, have, been, encouraged, by, iguanodont, feeding, because, gymnosperms, would, be, removed, allowing, more, space, for, the, weed, like, early, angiosperms, to, grow, the, evidence, is, not, conclusive, though, whatever, its, exact, diet, due, to, its, size, and, abundance, iguanodon, is, regarded, as, a, dominant, medium, to, large, herbivore, for, its, ecological, communities, in, england, this, included, the, small, predator, aristosuchus, larger, predators, eotyrannus, baryonyx, and, neovenator, low, feeding, herbivores, hypsilophodon, and, valdosaurus, fellow, iguanodontid, mantellisaurus, the, armoured, herbivore, polacanthus, and, sauropods, like, pelorosaurus, early, fossil, remains, were, fragmentary, which, led, to, much, speculation, on, the, posture, and, nature, of, iguanodon, iguanodon, was, initially, portrayed, as, a, quadrupedal, horn, nosed, beast, however, as, more, bones, were, discovered, mantell, observed, that, the, forelimbs, were, much, smaller, than, the, hindlimbs, his, rival, owen, was, of, the, opinion, it, was, a, stumpy, creature, with, four, pillar, like, legs, the, job, of, overseeing, the, first, lifesize, reconstruction, of, dinosaurs, was, initially, offered, to, mantell, who, declined, due, to, poor, health, and, owen, s, vision, subsequently, formed, the, basis, on, which, the, sculptures, took, shape, its, bipedal, nature, was, revealed, with, the, discovery, of, the, bernissart, skeletons, however, it, was, depicted, in, an, upright, posture, with, the, tail, dragging, along, the, ground, acting, as, the, third, leg, of, a, tripod, during, his, re, examination, of, iguanodon, david, norman, was, able, to, show, that, this, posture, was, unlikely, because, the, long, tail, was, stiffened, with, ossified, tendons, to, get, the, tripodal, pose, the, tail, would, literally, have, to, be, broken, putting, the, animal, in, a, horizontal, posture, makes, many, aspects, of, the, arms, and, pectoral, girdle, more, understandable, for, example, the, hand, is, relatively, immobile, with, the, three, central, fingers, grouped, together, bearing, hoof, like, phalanges, and, able, to, hyperextend, this, would, have, allowed, them, to, bear, weight, the, wrist, is, also, relatively, immobile, and, the, arms, and, shoulder, bones, robust, these, features, all, suggest, that, the, animal, spent, time, on, all, fours, furthermore, it, appears, that, iguanodon, became, more, quadrupedal, as, it, got, older, and, heavier, juvenile, i, bernissartensis, have, shorter, arms, than, adults, 60, of, hindlimb, length, versus, 70, for, adults, when, walking, as, a, quadruped, the, animal, s, hands, would, have, been, held, so, that, the, palms, faced, each, other, as, shown, by, iguanodontian, trackways, and, the, anatomy, of, this, genus, s, arms, and, hands, the, three, toed, pes, foot, of, iguanodon, was, relatively, long, and, when, walking, both, the, hand, and, the, foot, would, have, been, used, in, a, digitigrade, fashion, walking, on, the, fingers, and, toes, the, maximum, speed, of, iguanodon, has, been, estimated, at, 24, km, h, 15, mph, which, would, have, been, as, a, biped, it, would, not, have, been, able, to, gallop, as, a, quadruped, large, three, toed, footprints, are, known, in, early, cretaceous, rocks, of, england, particularly, wealden, beds, on, the, isle, of, wight, and, these, trace, fossils, were, originally, difficult, to, interpret, some, authors, associated, them, with, dinosaurs, early, on, in, 1846, e, tagert, went, so, far, as, to, assign, them, to, an, ichnogenus, he, named, iguanodon, and, samuel, beckles, noted, in, 1854, that, they, looked, like, bird, tracks, but, might, have, come, from, dinosaurs, the, identity, of, the, trackmakers, was, greatly, clarified, upon, the, discovery, in, 1857, of, the, hind, leg, of, a, young, iguanodon, with, distinctly, three, toed, feet, showing, that, such, dinosaurs, could, have, made, the, tracks, despite, the, lack, of, direct, evidence, these, tracks, are, often, attributed, to, iguanodon, a, trackway, in, england, shows, what, may, be, an, iguanodon, moving, on, all, fours, but, the, foot, prints, are, poor, making, a, direct, connection, difficult, tracks, assigned, to, the, ichnogenus, iguanodon, are, known, from, locations, including, places, in, europe, where, the, body, fossil, iguanodon, is, known, to, spitsbergen, svalbard, norway, the, thumb, spike, is, one, of, the, best, known, features, of, iguanodon, although, it, was, originally, placed, on, the, animal, s, nose, by, mantell, the, complete, bernissart, specimens, allowed, dollo, to, place, it, correctly, on, the, hand, as, a, modified, thumb, this, would, not, be, the, last, time, a, dinosaur, s, modified, thumb, claw, would, be, misinterpreted, noasaurus, baryonyx, and, megaraptor, are, examples, since, the, 1980s, where, an, enlarged, thumb, claw, was, first, put, on, the, foot, as, in, dromaeosaurids, this, thumb, is, typically, interpreted, as, a, close, quarter, stiletto, like, weapon, against, predators, although, it, could, also, have, been, used, to, break, into, seeds, and, fruits, or, against, other, iguanodon, one, author, has, suggested, that, the, spike, was, attached, to, a, venom, gland, but, this, has, not, been, accepted, as, the, spike, was, not, hollow, nor, were, there, any, grooves, on, the, spike, for, conducting, venom, although, sometimes, interpreted, as, the, result, of, a, single, catastrophe, the, bernissart, finds, instead, are, now, interpreted, as, recording, multiple, events, according, to, this, interpretation, at, least, three, occasions, of, mortality, are, recorded, and, though, numerous, individuals, would, have, died, in, a, geologically, short, time, span, 10, 100, years, this, does, not, necessarily, mean, these, iguanodon, were, herding, animals, an, argument, against, herding, is, that, juvenile, remains, are, very, uncommon, at, this, site, unlike, modern, cases, with, herd, mortality, they, more, likely, were, the, periodic, victims, of, flash, floods, whose, carcasses, accumulated, in, a, lake, or, marshy, setting, the, nehden, find, however, with, its, greater, span, of, individual, ages, more, even, mix, of, dollodon, or, mantellisaurus, to, iguanodon, bernissartensis, and, confined, geographic, nature, may, record, mortality, of, herding, animals, migrating, through, rivers, there, is, no, evidence, that, iguanodon, was, sexually, dimorphic, with, one, sex, appreciably, different, from, the, other, at, one, time, it, was, suggested, that, the, bernissart, i, mantelli, or, i, atherfieldensis, dollodon, and, mantellisaurus, respectively, represented, a, sex, possibly, female, of, the, larger, and, more, robust, possibly, male, i, bernissartensis, however, this, is, not, supported, today, a, 2017, analysis, showed, that, i, bernissartensis, does, exhibit, a, large, level, of, individual, variation, in, both, its, limbs, scapula, humerus, thumb, claw, ilium, ischium, femur, tibia, and, spinal, column, axis, sacrum, tail, vertebrae, additionally, this, analysis, found, that, individuals, of, i, bernissartensis, generally, seemed, to, fall, into, two, categories, based, on, whether, their, tail, vertebrae, bore, a, furrow, on, the, bottom, and, whether, their, thumb, claws, were, large, or, small, evidence, of, a, fractured, hip, bone, was, found, in, a, specimen, of, iguanodon, which, had, an, injury, to, its, ischium, two, other, individuals, were, observed, with, signs, of, osteoarthritis, as, evidenced, by, bone, overgrowths, in, their, anklebones, which, are, called, osteophytes, since, its, description, in, 1825, iguanodon, has, been, a, feature, of, worldwide, popular, culture, two, lifesize, reconstructions, of, mantellodon, considered, iguanodon, at, the, time, built, at, the, crystal, palace, in, london, in, 1852, greatly, contributed, to, the, popularity, of, the, genus, their, thumb, spikes, were, mistaken, for, horns, and, they, were, depicted, as, elephant, like, quadrupeds, yet, this, was, the, first, time, an, attempt, was, made, at, constructing, full, size, dinosaur, models, in, 1910, heinrich, harder, portrayed, a, group, of, iguanodon, in, tiere, der, urwelt, a, classic, german, collecting, card, game, about, extinct, and, prehistoric, animals, several, motion, pictures, have, featured, iguanodon, in, the, 2000, disney, animated, film, dinosaur, an, iguanodon, named, aladar, served, as, the, protagonist, with, three, other, iguanodonts, as, other, main, and, minor, characters, are, neera, kron, and, bruton, a, loosely, related, ride, of, the, same, name, at, disney, s, animal, kingdom, is, based, around, bringing, an, iguanodon, back, to, the, present, iguanodon, is, one, of, the, three, dinosaur, genera, that, inspired, godzilla, the, other, two, were, tyrannosaurus, rex, and, stegosaurus, iguanodon, has, also, made, appearances, in, some, of, the, many, the, land, before, time, films, as, well, as, episodes, of, the, television, series, aside, from, appearances, in, movies, iguanodon, has, also, been, featured, on, the, television, documentary, miniseries, walking, with, dinosaurs, 1999, produced, by, the, bbc, along, with, then, undescribed, dakotadon, lakotaensis, and, played, a, starring, role, in, sir, arthur, conan, doyle, s, book, the, lost, world, as, well, as, featuring, in, the, 2015, documentary, dinosaur, britain, it, also, was, present, in, bob, bakker, s, raptor, red, 1995, as, a, utahraptor, prey, item, a, main, belt, asteroid, 1989, cb, 3, has, been, named, 9941, iguanodon, in, honour, of, the, genus, because, it, is, both, one, of, the, first, dinosaurs, described, and, one, of, the, best, known, dinosaurs, iguanodon, has, been, well, placed, as, a, barometer, of, changing, public, and, scientific, perceptions, on, dinosaurs, its, reconstructions, have, gone, through, three, stages, the, elephantine, quadrupedal, horn, snouted, reptile, satisfied, the, victorians, then, a, bipedal, but, still, fundamentally, reptilian, animal, using, its, tail, to, prop, itself, up, dominated, the, early, 20th, century, but, was, slowly, overturned, during, the, 1960s, by, its, current, more, agile, and, dynamic, representation, able, to, shift, from, two, legs, to, all, fours
