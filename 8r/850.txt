cercopithecinae, 13, genera, colobinae, 10, genera, sister, hominoidea, old, world, monkeys, are, primates, in, the, family, cercopithecidae, s, r, k, o, p, s, d, i, twenty, four, genera, and, 138, species, are, recognized, making, it, the, largest, primate, family, old, world, monkey, genera, include, baboons, genus, papio, red, colobus, genus, piliocolobus, and, macaques, genus, macaca, common, names, for, other, old, world, monkeys, include, the, talapoin, guenon, colobus, douc, douc, langur, genus, pygathrix, vervet, gelada, mangabey, a, group, of, genera, langur, mandrill, drill, surili, presbytis, patas, and, proboscis, monkey, phylogenetically, they, are, more, closely, related, to, apes, than, to, new, world, monkeys, with, the, old, world, monkeys, and, apes, diverging, from, a, common, ancestor, between, 25, million, and, 30, million, years, ago, this, clade, containing, the, old, world, monkeys, and, the, apes, diverged, from, a, common, ancestor, with, the, new, world, monkeys, around, 45, to, 55, million, years, ago, the, individual, species, of, old, world, monkey, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, apes, or, any, other, grouping, with, a, common, ancestor, around, 14, million, years, ago, the, smallest, old, world, monkey, is, the, talapoin, with, a, head, and, body, 34, 37, centimetres, 13, 15, in, in, length, and, weighing, between, 0, 7, and, 1, 3, kilograms, 1, 5, and, 2, 9, lb, the, largest, is, the, male, mandrill, around, 70, centimetres, 28, in, in, length, and, weighing, up, to, 50, kilograms, 110, lb, old, world, monkeys, have, a, variety, of, facial, features, some, have, snouts, some, are, flat, nosed, and, many, exhibit, coloration, most, have, tails, but, they, are, not, prehensile, old, world, monkeys, are, native, to, africa, and, asia, today, inhabiting, numerous, environments, tropical, rain, forests, savannas, shrublands, and, mountainous, terrain, they, inhabited, much, of, europe, in, the, past, today, the, only, survivors, in, europe, are, the, barbary, macaques, of, gibraltar, whether, they, were, native, to, gibraltar, or, were, brought, by, humans, is, unknown, some, old, world, monkeys, are, arboreal, such, as, the, colobus, monkeys, others, are, terrestrial, such, as, the, baboons, most, are, at, least, partially, omnivorous, but, all, prefer, plant, matter, which, forms, the, bulk, of, their, diets, most, are, highly, opportunistic, primarily, eating, fruit, but, also, consuming, almost, any, food, item, available, such, as, flowers, leaves, bulbs, and, rhizomes, insects, snails, small, mammals, and, garbage, and, handouts, from, humans, two, subfamilies, are, recognized, the, cercopithecinae, which, are, mainly, african, but, include, the, diverse, genus, of, macaques, which, are, asian, and, north, african, and, the, colobinae, which, includes, most, of, the, asian, genera, but, also, the, african, colobus, monkeys, the, linnaean, classification, beginning, with, the, superfamily, is, the, distinction, between, apes, and, monkeys, is, complicated, by, the, traditional, paraphyly, of, monkeys, apes, emerged, as, a, sister, group, of, old, world, monkeys, in, the, catarrhines, which, are, a, sister, group, of, new, world, monkeys, therefore, cladistically, apes, catarrhines, and, related, contemporary, extinct, groups, such, as, parapithecidae, are, monkeys, as, well, for, any, consistent, definition, of, monkey, old, world, monkey, may, also, legitimately, be, taken, to, be, meant, to, include, all, the, catarrhines, including, apes, and, extinct, species, such, as, aegyptopithecus, in, which, case, the, apes, cercopithecoidea, and, aegyptopithecus, as, well, as, under, an, even, more, expanded, definition, even, the, platyrrhini, emerged, within, the, old, world, monkeys, historically, monkeys, from, the, old, world, afro, arabia, somehow, drifted, to, the, new, world, some, 40, million, years, ago, forming, the, new, world, monkeys, platyrrhines, apes, would, emerge, later, within, the, afro, arabia, group, old, world, monkeys, are, medium, to, large, in, size, and, range, from, arboreal, forms, such, as, the, colobus, monkeys, to, fully, terrestrial, forms, such, as, the, baboons, the, smallest, is, the, talapoin, with, a, head, and, body, 34, 37, cm, in, length, and, weighing, between, 0, 7, and, 1, 3, kilograms, while, the, largest, is, the, male, mandrill, the, females, of, the, species, being, significantly, smaller, at, around, 70, cm, in, length, and, weighing, up, to, 50, kilograms, most, old, world, monkeys, have, tails, the, family, name, means, tailed, ape, unlike, the, tailless, apes, the, tails, of, old, world, monkeys, are, not, prehensile, unlike, those, of, the, new, world, monkeys, platyrrhines, the, distinction, of, catarrhines, from, platyrrhines, depends, on, the, structure, of, the, rhinarium, and, the, distinction, of, old, world, monkeys, from, apes, depends, on, dentition, the, number, of, teeth, is, the, same, in, both, but, they, are, shaped, differently, in, platyrrhines, the, nostrils, face, sideways, while, in, catarrhines, they, face, downward, other, distinctions, include, both, a, tubular, ectotympanic, ear, bone, and, eight, not, twelve, premolars, in, catarrhines, giving, them, a, dental, formula, of, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, several, old, world, monkeys, have, anatomical, oddities, for, example, the, colobus, monkeys, have, stubs, for, thumbs, to, assist, with, their, arboreal, movement, the, proboscis, monkey, has, an, extraordinary, nose, while, the, snub, nosed, monkeys, have, almost, no, nose, at, all, the, penis, of, the, male, mandrill, is, crimson, and, the, scrotum, is, lilac, the, face, is, also, brightly, colored, the, coloration, is, more, pronounced, in, dominant, males, the, old, world, monkeys, are, native, to, africa, and, asia, today, inhabiting, numerous, environments, tropical, rain, forests, savannas, shrublands, and, mountainous, terrain, they, inhabited, much, of, europe, during, the, neogene, period, today, the, only, survivors, in, europe, are, the, barbary, macaques, of, gibraltar, most, old, world, monkeys, are, at, least, partially, omnivorous, but, all, prefer, plant, matter, which, forms, the, bulk, of, their, diet, leaf, monkeys, are, the, most, vegetarian, subsisting, primarily, on, leaves, and, eating, only, a, small, number, of, insects, while, the, other, species, are, highly, opportunistic, primarily, eating, fruit, but, also, consuming, almost, any, food, items, available, such, as, flowers, leaves, bulbs, and, rhizomes, insects, snails, and, even, small, vertebrates, the, barbary, macaque, s, diet, consists, mostly, of, leaves, and, roots, though, it, will, also, eat, insects, and, uses, cedar, trees, as, a, water, source, gestation, in, the, old, world, monkeys, lasts, between, five, and, seven, months, births, are, usually, single, although, as, with, humans, twins, occur, occasionally, the, young, are, born, relatively, well, developed, and, are, able, to, cling, onto, their, mother, s, fur, with, their, hands, from, birth, compared, with, most, other, mammals, they, take, a, long, time, to, reach, sexual, maturity, with, four, to, six, years, being, typical, of, most, species, in, most, species, daughters, remain, with, their, mothers, for, life, so, that, the, basic, social, group, among, old, world, monkeys, is, a, matrilineal, troop, males, leave, the, group, on, reaching, adolescence, and, find, a, new, troop, to, join, in, many, species, only, a, single, adult, male, lives, with, each, group, driving, off, all, rivals, but, others, are, more, tolerant, establishing, hierarchical, relationships, between, dominant, and, subordinate, males, group, sizes, are, highly, variable, even, within, species, depending, on, the, availability, of, food, and, other, resources
