of, medicines, it, is, a, miscellaneous, science, as, it, links, health, sciences, with, pharmaceutical, sciences, and, natural, sciences, the, professional, practice, is, becoming, more, clinically, oriented, as, most, of, the, drugs, are, now, manufactured, by, pharmaceutical, industries, based, on, the, setting, pharmacy, practice, is, either, classified, as, community, or, institutional, pharmacy, providing, direct, patient, care, in, the, community, of, institutional, pharmacies, is, considered, clinical, pharmacy, the, scope, of, pharmacy, practice, includes, more, traditional, roles, such, as, compounding, and, dispensing, of, medications, it, also, includes, more, modern, services, related, to, health, care, including, clinical, services, reviewing, medications, for, safety, and, efficacy, and, providing, drug, information, with, patient, counselling, pharmacists, therefore, are, experts, on, drug, therapy, and, are, the, primary, health, professionals, who,

medicines, as, well, as, miscellaneous, items, such, as, confectionery, cosmetics, office, supplies, toys, hair, care, products, and, magazines, and, occasionally, refreshments, and, groceries, in, its, investigation, of, herbal, and, chemical, ingredients, the, work, of, the, apothecary, may, be, regarded, as, a, precursor, of, the, modern, sciences, of, chemistry, and, pharmacology, prior, to, the, formulation, of, the, scientific, method, the, field, of, pharmacy, can, generally, be, divided, into, various, disciplines, the, boundaries, between, these, disciplines, and, with, other, sciences, such, as, biochemistry, are, not, always, clear, cut, often, collaborative, teams, from, various, disciplines, pharmacists, and, other, scientists, work, together, toward, the, introduction, of, new, therapeutics, and, methods, for, patient, care, however, pharmacy, is, not, a, basic, or, biomedical, science, in, its, typical, form, medicinal, chemistry, is, also, a, distinct, branch, of, synthetic, chemistry, combining, pharmacology, organic, chemistry, and, chemical, biology, pharmacology, is, sometimes, considered, the, fourth, discipline, of, pharmacy, although, pharmacology, is, essential, to, the, study, of, pharmacy, it, is, not, specific, to, pharmacy, both, disciplines, are, distinct, those, who, wish, to, practice, both, pharmacy, patient, oriented, and, pharmacology, a, biomedical, science, requiring, the, scientific, method, receive, separate, training, and, degrees, unique, to, either, discipline, pharmacoinformatics, is, considered, another, new, discipline, for, systematic, drug, discovery, and, development, with, efficiency, and, safety, pharmacogenomics, is, the, study, of, genetic, linked, variants, that, effect, patient, clinical, responses, allergies, and, metabolism, of, drugs, the, world, health, organization, estimates, that, there, are, at, least, 2, 6, million, pharmacists, and, other, pharmaceutical, personnel, worldwide, pharmacists, are,

medicines, pharmacists, may, also, be, small, business, proprietors, owning, the, pharmacy, in, which, they, practice, since, pharmacists, know, about, the, mode, of, action, of, a, particular, drug, and, its, metabolism, and, physiological, effects, on, the, human, body, in, great, detail, they, play, an, important, role, in, optimization, of, drug, treatment, for, an, individual, pharmacists,

emergency, medicine, toxicology, nuclear, pharmacy, pain, management, psychiatry, anti, coagulation, clinics, herbal, medicine, neurology, epilepsy, management, pediatrics, neonatal, pharmacists, and, more, hospital, pharmacies, can, often, be, found, within, the, premises, of, the, hospital, hospital, pharmacies, usually, stock, a, larger, range, of, medications, including, more, specialized, medications, than, would, be, feasible, in, the, community, setting, most, hospital, medications, are, unit, dose, or, a, single, dose, of, medicine, hospital, pharmacists, and, trained, pharmacy, technicians, compound, sterile, products, for, patients, including, total, parenteral, nutrition, tpn, and, other, medications, are, given, intravenously, that, is, a, complex, process, that, requires, adequate, training, of, personnel, quality, assurance, of, products, and, adequate, facilities, several, hospital, pharmacies, have, decided, to, outsource, high, risk, preparations, and, some, other, compounding, functions, to, companies, who, specialize, in, compounding, the, high, cost, of, medications, and, drug, related, technology, and, the, potential, impact, of, medications, and, pharmacy, services, on, patient, care, outcomes, and, patient, safety, require, hospital, pharmacies, to, perform, at, the, highest, level, possible, pharmacists, provide, direct, patient, care, services, that, optimize, the, use, of, medication, and, promotes, health, wellness, and, disease, prevention, clinical, pharmacists, care, for, patients, in, all, health, care, settings, but, the, clinical, pharmacy, movement, initially, began, inside, hospitals, and, clinics, clinical, pharmacists, often, collaborate, with, physicians, and, other, healthcare, professionals, to, improve, pharmaceutical, care, clinical, pharmacists, are, now, an, integral, part, of, the, interdisciplinary, approach, to, patient, care, they, often, participate, in, patient, care, rounds, for, drug, product, selection, in, the, uk, clinical, pharmacists, can, also, prescribe, some, medications, for, patients, on, the, nhs, or, privately, after, completing, a, non, medical, prescribers, course, to, become, an, independent, prescriber, the, clinical, pharmacist, s, role, involves, creating, a, comprehensive, drug, therapy, plan, for, patient, specific, problems, identifying, goals, of, therapy, and, reviewing, all, prescribed, medications, prior, to, dispensing, and, administration, to, the, patient, the, review, process, often, involves, an, evaluation, of, the, appropriateness, of, drug, therapy, e, g, drug, choice, dose, route, frequency, and, duration, of, therapy, and, its, efficacy, research, shows, that, pharmacist, led, strategies, reduce, errors, related, to, medication, use, the, pharmacist, must, also, consider, potential, drug, interactions, adverse, drug, reactions, and, patient, drug, allergies, while, they, design, and, initiate, a, drug, therapy, plan, since, the, emergence, of, modern, clinical, pharmacy, ambulatory, care, pharmacy, practice, has, emerged, as, a, unique, pharmacy, practice, setting, ambulatory, care, pharmacy, is, based, primarily, on, pharmacotherapy, services, that, a, pharmacist, provides, in, a, clinic, pharmacists, in, this, setting, often, do, not, dispense, drugs, but, rather, see, patients, in, office, visits, to, manage, chronic, disease, states, in, the, u, s, federal, health, care, system, including, the, va, the, indian, health, service, and, nih, ambulatory, care, pharmacists, are, given, full, independent, prescribing, authority, in, some, states, such, north, carolina, and, new, mexico, these, pharmacist, clinicians, are, given, collaborative, prescriptive, and, diagnostic, authority, in, 2011, the, board, of, pharmaceutical, specialties, approved, ambulatory, care, pharmacy, practice, as, a, separate, board, certification, the, official, designation, for, pharmacists, who, pass, the, ambulatory, care, pharmacy, specialty, certification, exam, will, be, board, certified, ambulatory, care, pharmacist, and, these, pharmacists, will, carry, the, initials, bcacp, compounding, involves, preparing, drugs, in, forms, that, are, different, from, the, generic, prescription, standard, this, may, include, altering, the, strength, ingredients, or, dosage, form, compounding, is, a, way, to, create, custom, drugs, for, patients, who, may, not, be, able, to, take, the, medication, in, its, standard, form, such, as, due, to, an, allergy, or, difficulty, swallowing, compounding, is, necessary, for, these, patients, to, still, be, able, to, properly, get, the, prescriptions, they, need, one, area, of, compounding, is, preparing, drugs, in, new, dosage, forms, for, example, if, a, drug, manufacturer, only, provides, a, drug, as, a, tablet, a, compounding, pharmacist, might, make, a, medicated, lollipop, that, contains, the, drug, patients, who, have, difficulty, swallowing, the, tablet, may, prefer, to, suck, the, medicated, lollipop, instead, another, form, of, compounding, is, by, mixing, different, strengths, g, mg, mcg, of, capsules, or, tablets, to, yield, the, desired, amount, of, medication, indicated, by, the, physician, physician, assistant, nurse, practitioner, or, clinical, pharmacist, practitioner, this, form, of, compounding, is, found, at, community, or, hospital, pharmacies, or, in, home, administration, therapy, compounding, pharmacies, specialize, in, compounding, although, many, also, dispense, the, same, non, compounded, drugs, that, patients, can, obtain, from, community, pharmacies, consultant, pharmacy, practice, focuses, more, on, medication, regimen, review, i, e, cognitive, services, than, on, actual, dispensing, of, drugs, consultant, pharmacists, most, typically, work, in, nursing, homes, but, are, increasingly, branching, into, other, institutions, and, non, institutional, settings, traditionally, consultant, pharmacists, were, usually, independent, business, owners, though, in, the, united, states, many, now, work, for, a, large, pharmacy, management, company, such, as, omnicare, kindred, healthcare, or, pharmerica, this, trend, may, be, gradually, reversing, as, consultant, pharmacists, begin, to, work, directly, with, patients, primarily, because, many, elderly, people, are, now, taking, numerous, medications, but, continue, to, live, outside, of, institutional, settings, some, community, pharmacies, employ, consultant, pharmacists, and, or, provide, consulting, services, the, main, principle, of, consultant, pharmacy, is, developed, by, hepler, and, strand, in, 1990, veterinary, pharmacies, sometimes, called, animal, pharmacies, may, fall, in, the, category, of, hospital, pharmacy, retail, pharmacy, or, mail, order, pharmacy, veterinary, pharmacies, stock, different, varieties, and, different, strengths, of, medications, to, fulfill, the, pharmaceutical, needs, of, animals, because, the, needs, of, animals, as, well, as, the, regulations, on, veterinary, medicine, are, often, very, different, from, those, related, to, people, in, some, jurisdictions, veterinary, pharmacy, may, be, kept, separate, from, regular, pharmacies, nuclear, pharmacy, focuses, on, preparing, radioactive, materials, for, diagnostic, tests, and, for, treating, certain, diseases, nuclear, pharmacists, undergo, additional, training, specific, to, handling, radioactive, materials, and, unlike, in, community, and, hospital, pharmacies, nuclear, pharmacists, typically, do, not, interact, directly, with, patients, military, pharmacy, is, a, different, working, environment, to, civilian, practise, because, military, pharmacy, technicians, perform, duties, such, as, evaluating, medication, orders, preparing, medication, orders, and, dispensing, medications, this, would, be, illegal, in, civilian, pharmacies, because, these, duties, are, required, to, be, performed, by, a, licensed, registered, pharmacist, in, the, us, military, state, laws, that, prevent, technicians, from, counseling, patients, or, doing, the, final, medication, check, prior, to, dispensing, to, patients, rather, than, a, pharmacist, solely, responsible, for, these, duties, do, not, apply, pharmacy, informatics, is, the, combination, of, pharmacy, practice, science, and, applied, information, science, pharmacy, informaticists, work, in, many, practice, areas, of, pharmacy, however, they, may, also, work, in, information, technology, departments, or, for, healthcare, information, technology, vendor, companies, as, a, practice, area, and, specialist, domain, pharmacy, informatics, is, growing, quickly, to, meet, the, needs, of, major, national, and, international, patient, information, projects, and, health, system, interoperability, goals, pharmacists, in, this, area, are, trained, to, participate, in, medication, management, system, development, deployment, and, optimization, specialty, pharmacies, supply, high, cost, injectable, oral, infused, or, inhaled, medications, that, are, used, for, chronic, and, complex, disease, states, such, as, cancer, hepatitis, and, rheumatoid, arthritis, unlike, a, traditional, community, pharmacy, where, prescriptions, for, any, common, medication, can, be, brought, in, and, filled, specialty, pharmacies, carry, novel, medications, that, need, to, be, properly, stored, administered, carefully, monitored, and, clinically, managed, in, addition, to, supplying, these, drugs, specialty, pharmacies, also, provide, lab, monitoring, adherence, counseling, and, assist, patients, with, cost, containment, strategies, needed, to, obtain, their, expensive, specialty, drugs, in, the, us, it, is, currently, the, fastest, growing, sector, of, the, pharmaceutical, industry, with, 19, of, 28, newly, fda, approved, medications, in, 2013, being, specialty, drugs, due, to, the, demand, for, clinicians, who, can, properly, manage, these, specific, patient, populations, the, specialty, pharmacy, certification, board, has, developed, a, new, certification, exam, to, certify, specialty, pharmacists, along, with, the, 100, questions, computerized, multiple, choice, exam, pharmacists, must, also, complete, 3, 000, hours, of, specialty, pharmacy, practice, within, the, past, three, years, as, well, as, 30, hours, of, specialty, pharmacist, continuing, education, within, the, past, two, years, the, pharmaceutical, sciences, are, a, group, of, interdisciplinary, areas, of, study, concerned, with, the, design, manufacturing, action, delivery, and, classification, of, drugs, they, apply, knowledge, from, chemistry, inorganic, physical, biochemical, and, analytical, biology, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, cell, biology, and, molecular, biology, epidemiology, statistics, chemometrics, mathematics, physics, and, chemical, engineering, the, pharmaceutical, sciences, are, further, subdivided, into, several, specific, specialties, with, four, main, branches, as, new, discoveries, advance, and, extend, the, pharmaceutical, sciences, subspecialties, continue, to, be, added, to, this, list, importantly, as, knowledge, advances, boundaries, between, these, specialty, areas, of, pharmaceutical, sciences, are, beginning, to, blur, many, fundamental, concepts, are, common, to, all, pharmaceutical, sciences, these, shared, fundamental, concepts, further, the, understanding, of, their, applicability, to, all, aspects, of, pharmaceutical, research, and, drug, therapy, pharmacocybernetics, also, known, as, pharma, cybernetics, cybernetic, pharmacy, and, cyber, pharmacy, is, an, emerging, field, that, describes, the, science, of, supporting, drugs, and, medications,

separation, is, a, practice, in, medicine, and, pharmacy, in, which, the, physician, who, provides, a, medical, prescription, is, independent, from, the, pharmacist, who, provides, the, prescription, drug, in, the, western, world, there, are, centuries, of, tradition, for, separating, pharmacists, from, physicians, in, asian, countries, it, is, traditional, for, physicians, to, also, provide, drugs, in, contemporary, time, researchers, and, health, policy, analysts, have, more, deeply, considered, these, traditions, and, their, effects, advocates, for, separation, and, advocates, for, combining, make, similar, claims, for, each, of, their, conflicting, perspectives, saying, that, separating, or, combining, reduces, conflict, of, interest, in, the, healthcare, industry, unnecessary, health, care, and, lowers, costs, while, the, opposite, causes, those, things, research, in, various, places, reports, mixed, outcomes, in, different, circumstances, in, 2022, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, proposed, that, pharmaceutical, companies, should, be, required, to, collect, and, destroy, unused, or, expired, medicines, that, they, have, put, on, the, market, in, order, to, reduce, public, health, risks, around, the, misuse, of, medicines, obtained, from, waste, bins, the, development, of, antimicrobial, resistant, bacteria, from, the, discharge, of, antibiotics, into, environmental, systems, and, economic, losses, from, wasted, healthcare, resources, potentially, harmful, concentrations, of, pharmaceutical, waste, has, been, detected, in, more, than, a, quarter, of, water, samples, taken, from, 258, rivers, around, the, world, oecd, recommend, that, medicines, should, be, collected, separately, from, household, waste, and, that, marketplaces, and, redistribution, platforms, for, unused, close, to, expiry, date, medicines, should, be, set, up, such, extended, producer, responsibility, schemes, are, already, running, in, france, spain, and, portugal, in, the, coming, decades, pharmacists, are, expected, to, become, more, integral, within, the, health, care, system, rather, than, simply, dispensing, medication, pharmacists, are, increasingly, expected, to, be, compensated, for, their, patient, care, skills, in, particular, medication, therapy, management, mtm, includes, the, clinical, services, that, pharmacists, can, provide, for, their, patients, such, services, include, a, thorough, analysis, of, all, medication, prescription, non, prescription, and, herbals, currently, being, taken, by, an, individual, the, result, is, a, reconciliation, of, medication, and, patient, education, resulting, in, increased, patient, health, outcomes, and, decreased, costs, to, the, health, care, system, this, shift, has, already, commenced, in, some, countries, for, instance, pharmacists, in, australia, receive, remuneration, from, the, australian, government, for, conducting, comprehensive, home, medicines, reviews, in, canada, pharmacists, in, certain, provinces, have, limited, prescribing, rights, as, in, alberta, and, british, columbia, or, are, remunerated, by, their, provincial, government, for, expanded, services, such, as, medications, reviews, medschecks, in, ontario, in, the, united, kingdom, pharmacists, who, undertake, additional, training, are, obtaining, prescribing, rights, and, this, is, because, of, pharmacy, education, they, are, also, being, paid, for, by, the, government, for, medicine, use, reviews, in, scotland, the, pharmacist, can, write, prescriptions, for, scottish, registered, patients, of, their, regular, medications, for, the, majority, of, drugs, except, for, controlled, drugs, when, the, patient, is, unable, to, see, their, doctor, as, could, happen, if, they, are, away, from, home, or, the, doctor, is, unavailable, in, the, united, states, pharmaceutical, care, or, clinical, pharmacy, has, had, an, evolving, influence, on, the, practice, of, pharmacy, moreover, the, doctor, of, pharmacy, pharm, d, degree, is, now, required, before, entering, practice, and, some, pharmacists, now, complete, one, or, two, years, of, residency, or, fellowship, training, following, graduation, in, addition, consultant, pharmacists, who, traditionally, operated, primarily, in, nursing, homes, are, now, expanding, into, direct, consultation, with, patients, under, the, banner, of, senior, care, pharmacy, in, addition, to, patient, care, pharmacies, will, be, a, focal, point, for, medical, adherence, initiatives, there, is, enough, evidence, to, show, that, integrated, pharmacy, based, initiatives, significantly, impact, adherence, for, chronic, patients, for, example, a, study, published, in, nih, shows, pharmacy, based, interventions, improved, patients, medication, adherence, rates, by, 2, 1, percent, and, increased, physicians, initiation, rates, by, 38, percent, compared, to, the, control, group, the, symbols, most, commonly, associated, with, pharmacy, are, the, mortar, and, pestle, north, america, and, the, medical, prescription, character, which, is, often, written, as, rx, in, typed, text, the, green, greek, cross, in, france, argentina, the, united, kingdom, belgium, ireland, italy, spain, and, india, the, bowl, of, hygieia, only, often, used, in, the, netherlands, but, may, be, seen, combined, with, other, symbols, elsewhere, other, common, symbols, include, conical, measures, and, in, the, us, caduceuses, in, their, logos, a, red, stylized, letter, a, in, used, germany, and, austria, from, apotheke, the, german, word, for, pharmacy, from, the, same, greek, root, as, the, english, word, apothecary, the, show, globe, was, used, in, the, us, until, the, early, 20th, century, the, gaper, in, the,
