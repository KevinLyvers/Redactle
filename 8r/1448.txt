a, brain, tumor, occurs, when, abnormal, cells, form, within, the, brain, there, are, two, main, types, of, tumors, malignant, cancerous, tumors, and, benign, non, cancerous, tumors, these, can, be, further, classified, as, primary, tumors, which, start, within, the, brain, and, secondary, tumors, which, most, commonly, have, spread, from, tumors, located, outside, the, brain, known, as, brain, metastasis, tumors, all, types, of, brain, tumors, may, produce, symptoms, that, vary, depending, on, the, size, of, the, tumor, and, the, part, of, the, brain, that, is, involved, where, symptoms, exist, they, may, include, headaches, seizures, problems, with, vision, vomiting, and, mental, changes, other, symptoms, may, include, difficulty, walking, speaking, with, sensations, or, unconsciousness, the, cause, of, most, brain, tumors, is, unknown, though, up, to, 4, of, brain, cancers, may, be, caused, by, ct, scan, radiation, uncommon, risk, factors, include, exposure, to, vinyl, chloride, epstein, barr, virus, ionizing, radiation, and, inherited, syndromes, such, as, neurofibromatosis, tuberous, sclerosis, and, von, hippel, lindau, disease, studies, on, mobile, phone, exposure, have, not, shown, a, clear, risk, the, most, common, types, of, primary, tumors, in, adults, are, meningiomas, usually, benign, and, astrocytomas, such, as, glioblastomas, in, children, the, most, common, type, is, a, malignant, medulloblastoma, diagnosis, is, usually, by, medical, examination, along, with, computed, tomography, ct, or, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, the, result, is, then, often, confirmed, by, a, biopsy, based, on, the, findings, the, tumors, are, divided, into, different, grades, of, severity, treatment, may, include, some, combination, of, surgery, radiation, therapy, and, chemotherapy, if, seizures, occur, anticonvulsant, medication, may, be, needed, dexamethasone, and, furosemide, are, medications, that, may, be, used, to, decrease, swelling, around, the, tumor, some, tumors, grow, gradually, requiring, only, monitoring, and, possibly, needing, no, further, intervention, treatments, that, use, a, person, s, immune, system, are, being, studied, outcomes, for, malignant, tumors, vary, considerably, depending, on, the, type, of, tumor, and, how, far, it, has, spread, at, diagnosis, although, benign, tumors, only, grow, in, one, area, they, may, still, be, life, threatening, depending, on, their, size, and, location, malignant, glioblastomas, usually, have, very, poor, outcomes, while, benign, meningiomas, usually, have, good, outcomes, the, average, five, year, survival, rate, for, all, malignant, brain, cancers, in, the, united, states, is, 33, secondary, or, metastatic, brain, tumors, are, about, four, times, as, common, as, primary, brain, tumors, with, about, half, of, metastases, coming, from, lung, cancer, primary, brain, tumors, occur, in, around, 250, 000, people, a, year, globally, and, make, up, less, than, 2, of, cancers, in, children, younger, than, 15, brain, tumors, are, second, only, to, acute, lymphoblastic, leukemia, as, the, most, common, form, of, cancer, in, nsw, australia, in, 2005, the, average, lifetime, economic, cost, of, a, case, of, brain, cancer, was, au, 1, 9, million, the, greatest, of, any, type, of, cancer, the, signs, and, symptoms, of, brain, tumors, are, broad, people, may, experience, symptoms, regardless, of, whether, the, tumor, is, benign, not, cancerous, or, cancerous, primary, and, secondary, brain, tumors, present, with, similar, symptoms, depending, on, the, location, size, and, rate, of, growth, of, the, tumor, for, example, larger, tumors, in, the, frontal, lobe, can, cause, changes, in, the, ability, to, think, however, a, smaller, tumor, in, an, area, such, as, wernicke, s, area, small, area, responsible, for, language, comprehension, can, result, in, a, greater, loss, of, function, headaches, as, a, result, of, raised, intracranial, pressure, can, be, an, early, symptom, of, brain, cancer, however, isolated, headache, without, other, symptoms, is, rare, and, other, symptoms, including, visual, abnormalities, may, occur, before, headaches, become, common, certain, warning, signs, for, headache, exist, which, make, the, headache, more, likely, to, be, associated, with, brain, cancer, these, are, defined, as, abnormal, neurological, examination, headache, worsened, by, valsalva, maneuver, headache, causing, awakening, from, sleep, new, headache, in, the, older, population, progressively, worsening, headache, atypical, headache, features, or, patients, who, do, not, fulfill, the, strict, definition, of, migraine, other, associated, signs, are, headaches, that, are, worse, in, the, morning, or, that, subside, after, vomiting, the, brain, is, divided, into, lobes, and, each, lobe, or, area, has, its, own, function, a, tumor, in, any, of, these, lobes, may, affect, the, area, s, performance, the, symptoms, experienced, are, often, linked, to, the, location, of, the, tumor, but, each, person, may, experience, something, different, a, person, s, personality, may, be, altered, due, to, the, tumor, damaging, lobes, of, the, brain, since, the, frontal, temporal, and, parietal, lobes, control, inhibition, emotions, mood, judgement, reasoning, and, behavior, a, tumor, in, those, regions, can, cause, inappropriate, social, behavior, temper, tantrums, laughing, at, things, which, merit, no, laughter, and, even, psychological, symptoms, such, as, depression, and, anxiety, more, research, is, needed, into, the, effectiveness, and, safety, of, medication, for, depression, in, people, with, brain, tumors, personality, changes, can, have, damaging, effects, such, as, unemployment, unstable, relationships, and, a, lack, of, control, the, best, known, cause, of, brain, cancers, is, ionizing, radiation, approximately, 4, of, brain, cancers, in, the, general, population, are, caused, by, ct, scan, radiation, for, brain, cancers, that, follow, a, ct, scan, at, lags, of, 2, years, or, more, it, has, been, estimated, that, 40, are, attributable, to, ct, scan, radiation, the, relationship, between, ionizing, radiation, and, brain, cancers, can, be, best, explained, by, radiation, carcinogenesis, and, by, traditional, models, of, oncogenesis, the, stochastic, effects, of, ionizing, radiation, demonstrate, a, dose, response, relationship, to, the, probability, of, occurrence, but, no, dose, response, relationship, to, severity, of, disease, the, majority, of, radiation, induced, brain, cancers, are, caused, by, ionizing, radiation, from, medical, sources, such, as, ct, scans, mutations, and, deletions, of, tumor, suppressor, genes, such, as, p53, are, thought, to, be, the, cause, of, some, forms, of, brain, tumor, inherited, conditions, such, as, von, hippel, lindau, disease, tuberous, sclerosis, multiple, endocrine, neoplasia, and, neurofibromatosis, type, 2, carry, a, high, risk, for, the, development, of, brain, tumors, people, with, celiac, disease, have, a, slightly, increased, risk, of, developing, brain, tumors, smoking, may, increase, the, risk, but, evidence, of, this, remains, unclear, although, studies, have, not, shown, any, link, between, cell, phone, or, mobile, phone, radiation, and, the, occurrence, of, brain, tumors, the, world, health, organization, has, classified, mobile, phone, radiation, on, the, iarc, scale, into, group, 2b, possibly, carcinogenic, the, claim, that, cell, phone, usage, may, cause, brain, cancer, is, likely, based, on, epidemiological, studies, which, observed, a, slight, increase, in, glioma, risk, among, heavy, users, of, wireless, phones, when, those, studies, were, conducted, gsm, 2g, phones, were, in, use, modern, third, generation, 3g, phones, emit, on, average, about, 1, of, the, energy, emitted, by, those, gsm, 2g, phones, and, therefore, the, finding, of, an, association, between, cell, phone, usage, and, increased, risk, of, brain, cancer, is, not, based, upon, current, phone, usage, human, brains, are, surrounded, by, a, system, of, connective, tissue, membranes, called, meninges, that, separate, the, brain, from, the, skull, this, three, layered, covering, is, composed, of, from, the, outside, in, the, dura, mater, arachnoid, mater, and, pia, mater, the, arachnoid, and, pia, are, physically, connected, and, thus, often, considered, as, a, single, layer, the, leptomeninges, between, the, arachnoid, mater, and, the, pia, mater, is, the, subarachnoid, space, which, contains, cerebrospinal, fluid, csf, this, fluid, circulates, in, the, narrow, spaces, between, cells, and, through, the, cavities, in, the, brain, called, ventricles, to, support, and, protect, the, brain, tissue, blood, vessels, enter, the, central, nervous, system, through, the, perivascular, space, above, the, pia, mater, the, cells, in, the, blood, vessel, walls, are, joined, tightly, forming, the, blood, brain, barrier, which, protects, the, brain, from, toxins, that, might, enter, through, the, blood, tumors, of, the, meninges, are, meningiomas, and, are, often, benign, though, not, technically, a, tumor, of, brain, tissue, they, are, often, considered, brain, tumors, since, they, protrude, into, the, space, where, the, brain, is, causing, symptoms, since, they, are, usually, slow, growing, tumors, meningiomas, can, be, quite, large, by, the, time, symptoms, appear, the, brains, of, humans, and, other, vertebrates, are, composed, of, very, soft, tissue, and, have, a, gelatin, like, texture, living, brain, tissue, has, a, pink, tint, in, color, on, the, outside, gray, matter, and, nearly, complete, white, on, the, inside, white, matter, with, subtle, variations, in, color, the, three, largest, divisions, of, the, brain, are, these, areas, are, composed, of, two, broad, classes, of, cells, neurons, and, glia, these, two, types, are, equally, numerous, in, the, brain, as, a, whole, although, glial, cells, outnumber, neurons, roughly, 4, to, 1, in, the, cerebral, cortex, glia, come, in, several, types, which, perform, a, number, of, critical, functions, including, structural, support, metabolic, support, insulation, and, guidance, of, development, primary, tumors, of, the, glial, cells, are, called, gliomas, and, often, are, malignant, by, the, time, they, are, diagnosed, the, thalamus, and, hypothalamus, are, major, divisions, of, the, diencephalon, with, the, pituitary, gland, and, pineal, gland, attached, at, the, bottom, tumors, of, the, pituitary, and, pineal, gland, are, often, benign, the, brainstem, lies, between, the, large, cerebral, cortex, and, the, spinal, cord, it, is, divided, into, the, midbrain, pons, and, medulla, oblongata, the, spinal, cord, is, considered, a, part, of, the, central, nervous, system, it, is, made, up, of, the, same, cells, as, the, brain, neurons, and, glial, cells, although, there, is, no, specific, or, singular, symptom, or, sign, the, presence, of, a, combination, of, symptoms, and, the, lack, of, corresponding, indications, of, other, causes, can, be, an, indicator, for, investigation, towards, the, possibility, of, a, brain, tumor, brain, tumors, have, similar, characteristics, and, obstacles, when, it, comes, to, diagnosis, and, therapy, with, tumors, located, elsewhere, in, the, body, however, they, create, specific, issues, that, follow, closely, to, the, properties, of, the, organ, they, are, in, the, diagnosis, will, often, start, by, taking, a, medical, history, noting, medical, antecedents, and, current, symptoms, clinical, and, laboratory, investigations, will, serve, to, exclude, infections, as, the, cause, of, the, symptoms, examinations, in, this, stage, may, include, the, eyes, otolaryngological, or, ent, and, electrophysiological, exams, the, use, of, electroencephalography, eeg, often, plays, a, role, in, the, diagnosis, of, brain, tumors, brain, tumors, when, compared, to, tumors, in, other, areas, of, the, body, pose, a, challenge, for, diagnosis, commonly, radioactive, tracers, are, uptaken, in, large, volumes, in, tumors, due, to, the, high, activity, of, tumor, cells, allowing, for, radioactive, imaging, of, the, tumor, however, most, of, the, brain, is, separated, from, the, blood, by, the, blood, brain, barrier, bbb, a, membrane, that, exerts, a, strict, control, over, what, substances, are, allowed, to, pass, into, the, brain, therefore, many, tracers, that, may, reach, tumors, in, other, areas, of, the, body, easily, would, be, unable, to, reach, brain, tumors, until, there, was, a, disruption, of, the, bbb, by, the, tumor, disruption, of, the, bbb, is, well, imaged, via, mri, or, ct, scan, and, is, therefore, regarded, as, the, main, diagnostic, indicator, for, malignant, gliomas, meningiomas, and, brain, metastases, swelling, or, obstruction, of, the, passage, of, cerebrospinal, fluid, csf, from, the, brain, may, cause, early, signs, of, increased, intracranial, pressure, which, translates, clinically, into, headaches, vomiting, or, an, altered, state, of, consciousness, and, in, children, changes, to, the, diameter, of, the, skull, and, bulging, of, the, fontanelles, more, complex, symptoms, such, as, endocrine, dysfunctions, should, alarm, doctors, not, to, exclude, brain, tumors, a, bilateral, temporal, visual, field, defect, due, to, compression, of, the, optic, chiasm, or, dilation, of, the, pupil, and, the, occurrence, of, either, slowly, evolving, or, the, sudden, onset, of, focal, neurologic, symptoms, such, as, cognitive, and, behavioral, impairment, including, impaired, judgment, memory, loss, lack, of, recognition, spatial, orientation, disorders, personality, or, emotional, changes, hemiparesis, hypoesthesia, aphasia, ataxia, visual, field, impairment, impaired, sense, of, smell, impaired, hearing, facial, paralysis, double, vision, or, more, severe, symptoms, such, as, tremors, paralysis, on, one, side, of, the, body, hemiplegia, or, epileptic, seizures, in, a, patient, with, a, negative, history, for, epilepsy, should, raise, the, possibility, of, a, brain, tumor, medical, imaging, plays, a, central, role, in, the, diagnosis, of, brain, tumors, early, imaging, methods, invasive, and, sometimes, dangerous, such, as, pneumoencephalography, and, cerebral, angiography, have, been, abandoned, in, favor, of, non, invasive, high, resolution, techniques, especially, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, and, computed, tomography, ct, scans, though, mri, is, typically, the, reference, standard, used, neoplasms, will, often, show, as, differently, colored, masses, also, referred, to, as, processes, in, ct, or, mri, results, more, recently, advancements, have, been, made, to, increase, the, utility, of, mri, in, providing, physiological, data, that, can, help, to, inform, diagnosis, and, prognosis, mri, itself, is, sufficient, in, identifying, the, brain, tumor, s, location, and, morphology, but, other, types, of, mri, may, be, used, on, top, of, that, such, as, mra, mrs, pmri, fmri, and, dwi, these, imaging, techniques, help, doctors, and, surgeons, to, diagnose, the, type, of, tumor, plan, for, surgery, and, to, assess, treatment, and, radiation, chemotherapy, treatment, with, radiation, and, chemotherapy, can, lead, to, treatment, induced, changes, in, the, brain, visible, on, conventional, imaging, and, which, can, be, difficult, to, differentiate, from, tumor, recurrence, magnetic, resonance, angiography, mra, looks, at, the, blood, vessels, in, the, brain, in, the, diagnosis, of, brain, tumor, mras, are, typically, carried, out, before, surgery, to, help, surgeons, get, a, better, understanding, of, the, tumor, vasculature, for, example, a, study, was, done, where, surgeons, were, able, to, separate, benign, brain, tumors, from, malignant, ones, by, analyzing, the, shapes, of, the, blood, vessels, that, were, extracted, from, mra, although, not, required, some, mra, may, inject, contrast, agent, gadolinium, into, the, patient, to, get, an, enhanced, image, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, mrs, measures, the, metabolic, changes, or, chemical, changes, inside, the, tumor, the, most, common, mrs, is, proton, spectroscopy, with, its, frequency, measured, in, parts, per, million, ppm, gliomas, or, malignant, brain, tumors, have, different, spectra, from, normal, brain, tissue, in, that, they, have, greater, choline, levels, and, lower, n, acetyl, aspartate, naa, signals, using, mrs, in, brain, tumor, diagnosis, can, help, doctors, identify, the, type, of, tumor, and, its, aggressiveness, for, example, benign, brain, tumors, or, meningioma, have, increased, alanine, levels, it, can, also, help, to, distinguish, brain, tumors, from, scar, tissues, or, dead, tissues, caused, by, previous, radiation, treatment, which, does, not, have, increased, choline, levels, that, brain, tumors, have, and, from, tumor, mimicking, lesions, such, as, abscesses, or, infarcts, perfusion, magnetic, resonance, imaging, pmri, assess, the, blood, volume, and, blood, flow, of, different, parts, of, the, brain, and, brain, tumors, pmri, requires, the, injection, of, contrast, agent, usually, gadopentetate, dimeglumine, gd, dtpa, into, the, veins, in, order, to, enhance, the, contrast, pmri, provides, a, cerebral, blood, volume, map, that, shows, the, tumor, vascularity, and, angiogenesis, brain, tumors, would, require, a, larger, blood, supply, and, thus, would, show, a, high, cerebral, blood, volume, on, the, pmri, map, the, vascular, morphology, and, degree, of, angiogenesis, from, pmri, help, to, determine, the, grade, and, malignancy, of, brain, tumors, for, brain, tumor, diagnosis, pmri, is, useful, in, determining, the, best, site, to, perform, biopsy, and, to, help, reduce, sampling, error, pmri, is, also, valuable, for, after, treatment, to, determine, if, the, abnormal, area, is, a, remaining, tumor, or, a, scar, tissue, for, patients, that, are, undergoing, anti, angiogenesis, cancer, therapy, pmri, can, give, the, doctors, a, better, sense, of, efficacy, of, the, treatment, by, monitoring, tumor, cerebral, blood, volume, functional, mri, fmri, measures, blood, flow, changes, in, active, parts, of, the, brain, while, the, patient, is, performing, tasks, and, provides, specific, locations, of, the, brain, that, are, responsible, for, certain, functions, before, performing, a, brain, tumor, surgery, on, patients, neurosurgeons, would, use, fmri, to, avoid, damage, to, structures, of, the, brain, that, correspond, with, important, brain, functions, while, resecting, the, tumor, at, the, same, time, preoperative, fmri, is, important, because, it, is, often, difficult, to, distinguish, the, anatomy, near, the, tumor, as, it, distorts, its, surrounding, regions, neurosurgeons, would, use, fmri, to, plan, whether, to, perform, a, resection, where, tumor, is, surgically, removed, as, much, as, possible, a, biopsy, where, they, take, a, surgical, sampling, amount, to, provide, a, diagnosis, or, to, not, undergo, surgery, at, all, for, example, a, neurosurgeon, may, be, opposed, to, resecting, a, tumor, near, the, motor, cortex, as, that, would, affect, the, patient, s, movements, without, preoperative, fmri, the, neurosurgeon, would, have, to, perform, an, awake, craniotomy, where, the, patient, would, have, to, interact, during, open, surgery, to, see, if, tumor, removal, would, affect, important, brain, functions, diffusion, weighted, imaging, dwi, a, form, of, mri, that, measures, random, brownian, motion, of, water, molecules, along, a, magnetic, field, gradient, for, brain, tumor, diagnosis, measurement, of, apparent, diffusion, coefficient, adc, in, brain, tumors, allow, doctors, to, categorize, tumor, type, most, brain, tumors, have, higher, adc, than, normal, brain, tissues, and, doctors, can, match, the, observed, adc, of, the, patient, s, brain, tumor, with, a, list, of, accepted, adc, to, identify, tumor, type, dwi, is, also, useful, for, treatment, and, therapy, purposes, where, changes, in, diffusion, can, be, analyzed, in, response, to, drug, radiation, or, gene, therapy, successful, response, results, in, apoptosis, and, increase, in, diffusion, while, failed, treatment, results, in, unchanged, diffusion, values, computed, tomography, ct, scan, uses, x, rays, to, take, pictures, from, different, angles, and, computer, processing, to, combine, the, pictures, into, a, 3d, image, a, ct, scan, usually, serves, as, an, alternative, to, mri, in, cases, where, the, patient, cannot, have, an, mri, due, to, claustrophobia, or, pacemaker, compared, to, mri, a, ct, scan, shows, a, more, detailed, image, of, the, bone, structures, near, the, tumor, and, can, be, used, to, measure, the, tumor, s, size, like, an, mri, a, contrast, dye, may, also, be, injected, into, the, veins, or, ingested, by, mouth, before, a, ct, scan, to, better, outline, any, tumors, that, may, be, present, ct, scans, use, contrast, materials, that, are, iodine, based, and, barium, sulfate, compounds, the, downside, of, using, ct, scans, as, opposed, to, mri, is, that, some, brain, tumors, do, not, show, up, well, on, ct, scans, because, some, intra, axial, masses, are, faint, and, resemble, normal, brain, tissue, in, some, scenarios, brain, tumors, in, ct, scans, may, be, mistaken, for, infarction, infection, and, demyelination, to, suspect, that, an, intra, axial, mass, is, a, brain, tumor, instead, of, other, possibilities, there, must, be, unexplained, calcifications, in, the, brain, preservation, of, the, cortex, and, disproportionate, mass, effect, ct, angiography, cta, provides, information, about, the, blood, vessels, in, the, brain, using, x, rays, a, contrast, agent, is, always, required, to, be, injected, into, the, patient, in, the, ct, scanner, cta, serves, as, an, alternative, to, mra, positron, emission, tomography, pet, scan, uses, radioactive, substances, with, the, most, common, one, being, a, sugar, known, as, fdg, while, more, specific, tracers, for, glioma, are, emerging, this, injected, substance, is, taken, up, by, cells, that, are, actively, dividing, tumor, cells, are, more, active, in, dividing, so, they, would, absorb, more, of, the, radioactive, substance, after, injection, a, scanner, would, be, used, to, create, an, image, of, the, radioactive, areas, in, the, brain, pet, scans, are, used, more, often, for, high, grade, tumors, than, for, low, grade, tumors, it, is, useful, after, treatment, to, help, doctors, determine, if, the, abnormal, area, on, an, mri, image, is, a, remaining, tumor, or, a, scar, tissue, scar, tissues, will, not, show, up, on, pet, scans, while, tumors, would, however, these, techniques, cannot, alone, diagnose, high, versus, low, grade, gliomas, and, thus, the, definitive, diagnosis, of, brain, tumor, should, only, be, confirmed, by, histological, examination, of, tumor, tissue, samples, obtained, either, by, means, of, brain, biopsy, or, open, surgery, the, histological, examination, is, essential, for, determining, the, appropriate, treatment, and, the, correct, prognosis, this, examination, performed, by, a, pathologist, typically, has, three, stages, interoperative, examination, of, fresh, tissue, preliminary, microscopic, examination, of, prepared, tissues, and, follow, up, examination, of, prepared, tissues, after, immunohistochemical, staining, or, genetic, analysis, tumors, have, characteristics, that, allow, the, determination, of, malignancy, and, how, they, will, evolve, and, determining, these, characteristics, will, allow, the, medical, team, to, determine, the, management, plan, anaplasia, or, dedifferentiation, loss, of, differentiation, of, cells, and, of, their, orientation, to, one, another, and, blood, vessels, a, characteristic, of, anaplastic, tumor, tissue, anaplastic, cells, have, lost, total, control, of, their, normal, functions, and, many, have, deteriorated, cell, structures, anaplastic, cells, often, have, abnormally, high, nuclear, to, cytoplasmic, ratios, and, many, are, multinucleated, additionally, the, nucleus, of, anaplastic, cells, is, usually, unnaturally, shaped, or, oversized, cells, can, become, anaplastic, in, two, ways, neoplastic, tumor, cells, can, dedifferentiate, to, become, anaplasias, the, dedifferentiation, causes, the, cells, to, lose, all, of, their, normal, structure, function, or, cancer, stem, cells, can, increase, their, capacity, to, multiply, i, e, uncontrollable, growth, due, to, failure, of, differentiation, atypia, an, indication, of, abnormality, of, a, cell, which, may, be, indicative, of, malignancy, significance, of, the, abnormality, is, highly, dependent, on, context, neoplasia, the, uncontrolled, division, of, cells, as, such, neoplasia, is, not, problematic, but, its, consequences, are, the, uncontrolled, division, of, cells, means, that, the, mass, of, a, neoplasm, increases, in, size, and, in, a, confined, space, such, as, the, intracranial, cavity, this, quickly, becomes, problematic, because, the, mass, invades, the, space, of, the, brain, pushing, it, aside, leading, to, compression, of, the, brain, tissue, and, increased, intracranial, pressure, and, destruction, of, brain, parenchyma, increased, intracranial, pressure, icp, may, be, attributable, to, the, direct, mass, effect, of, the, tumor, increased, blood, volume, or, increased, cerebrospinal, fluid, csf, volume, which, may, in, turn, have, secondary, symptoms, necrosis, the, premature, death, of, cells, caused, by, external, factors, such, as, infection, toxin, or, trauma, necrotic, cells, send, the, wrong, chemical, signals, which, prevent, phagocytes, from, disposing, of, the, dead, cells, leading, to, a, buildup, of, dead, tissue, cell, debris, and, toxins, at, or, near, the, site, of, the, necrotic, cells, arterial, and, venous, hypoxia, or, the, deprivation, of, adequate, oxygen, supply, to, certain, areas, of, the, brain, occurs, when, a, tumor, makes, use, of, nearby, blood, vessels, for, its, supply, of, blood, and, the, neoplasm, enters, into, competition, for, nutrients, with, the, surrounding, brain, tissue, more, generally, a, neoplasm, may, cause, release, of, metabolic, end, products, e, g, free, radicals, altered, electrolytes, neurotransmitters, and, release, and, recruitment, of, cellular, mediators, e, g, cytokines, that, disrupt, normal, parenchymal, function, tumors, can, be, benign, or, malignant, can, occur, in, different, parts, of, the, brain, and, may, be, classified, as, primary, or, secondary, a, primary, tumor, is, one, that, has, started, in, the, brain, as, opposed, to, a, metastatic, tumor, which, is, one, that, has, spread, to, the, brain, from, another, area, of, the, body, the, incidence, of, metastatic, tumors, is, approximately, four, times, greater, than, primary, tumors, tumors, may, or, may, not, be, symptomatic, some, tumors, are, discovered, because, the, patient, has, symptoms, others, show, up,

secondary, tumors, of, the, brain, are, very, common, in, the, terminal, phases, of, patients, with, an, incurable, metastasized, cancer, the, most, common, types, of, cancers, that, bring, about, secondary, tumors, of, the, brain, are, lung, cancer, breast, cancer, malignant, melanoma, kidney, cancer, and, colon, cancer, in, decreasing, order, of, frequency, secondary, brain, tumors, are, more, common, than, primary, ones, in, the, united, states, there, are, about, 170, 000, new, cases, every, year, secondary, brain, tumors, are, the, most, common, cause, of, tumors, in, the,

medical, literature, is, surgical, removal, resection, via, craniotomy, minimally, invasive, techniques, are, becoming, the, dominant, trend, in, neurosurgical, oncology, the, main, objective, of, surgery, is, to, remove, as, many, tumor, cells, as, possible, with, complete, removal, being, the, best, outcome, and, cytoreduction, debulking, of, the, tumor, otherwise, a, gross, total, resection, gtr, occurs, when, all, visible, signs, of, the, tumor, are, removed, and, subsequent, scans, show, no, apparent, tumor, in, some, cases, access, to, the, tumor, is, impossible, and, impedes, or, prohibits, surgery, many, meningiomas, with, the, exception, of, some, tumors, located, at, the, skull, base, can, be, successfully, removed, surgically, most, pituitary, adenomas, can, be, removed,

integral, parts, of, the, therapeutic, standard, for, malignant, tumors, multiple, metastatic, tumors, are, generally, treated, with, radiotherapy, and, chemotherapy, rather, than, surgery, and, the, prognosis, in, such, cases, is, determined, by, the, primary, tumor, and, is, generally, poor, the, goal, of, radiation, therapy, is, to, kill, tumor, cells, while, leaving, normal, brain, tissue, unharmed, in, standard, external, beam, radiation, therapy, multiple, treatments, of, standard, dose, fractions, of, radiation, are, applied, to, the, brain, this, process, is, repeated, for, a, total, of, 10, to, 30, treatments, depending, on, the, type, of, tumor, this, additional, treatment, provides, some, patients, with, improved, outcomes, and, longer, survival, rates, radiosurgery, is, a, treatment, method, that, uses, computerized, calculations, to, focus, radiation, at, the, site, of, the, tumor, while, minimizing, the, radiation, dose, to, the, surrounding, brain, radiosurgery, may, be, an, adjunct, to, other, treatments, or, it, may, represent, the, primary, treatment, technique, for, some, tumors, forms, used, include, stereotactic, radiosurgery, such, as, gamma, knife, cyberknife, or, novalis, tx, radiosurgery, radiotherapy, is, the, most, common, treatment, for, secondary, brain, tumors, the, amount, of, radiotherapy, depends, on, the, size, of, the, area, of, the,

have, lower, incidences, of, tumors, of, the, brain, this, could, be, explained, by, undiagnosed, tumor, related, deaths, patients, in, extremely, poor, situations, do, not, get, diagnosed, simply, because, they, do, not, have, access, to, the, modern, diagnostic, facilities, required, to, diagnose, a, brain, tumor, and, by, deaths, caused, by, other, poverty, related, causes, that, preempt, a, patient, s, life, before, tumors, develop, or, tumors, become, life, threatening, nevertheless, statistics, suggest, that, certain, forms, of, primary, brain, tumors, are, more, common, among, certain, populations, the, incidence, of, low, grade, astrocytoma, has, not, been, shown, to, vary, significantly, with, nationality, however, studies, examining, the, incidence, of, malignant, central, nervous, system, cns, tumors, have, shown, some, variation, with, national, origin, since, some, high, grade, lesions, arise, from, low, grade, tumors, these, trends, are, worth, mentioning, specifically, the, incidence, of, cns, tumors, in, the, united, states, israel, and, the, nordic, countries, is, relatively, high, while, japan, and, asian, countries, have, a, lower, incidence, these, differences, probably, reflect, some, biological, differences, as, well, as, differences, in, pathologic, diagnosis, and, reporting, worldwide, data, on, incidence, of, cancer, can, be, found,
