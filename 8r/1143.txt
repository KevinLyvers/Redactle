within, a, fruit, which, is, dried, are, used, in, the, cuisines, of, many, cultures, in, both, whole, and, ground, form, although, cumin, is, used, in, traditional, medicine, there, is, no, high, quality, evidence, that, it, is, safe, or, effective, as, a, therapeutic, agent, the, term, comes, via, middle, english, comyn, from, old, english, cymen, which, is, cognate, with, old, high, german, kumin, and, old, french, cummin, both, from, the, latin, term, cuminum, this, in, turn, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, k, minon, a, semitic, borrowing, related, to, hebrew, kamm, n, and, arabic, kamm, n, all, of, these, ultimately, derive, from, akkadian, kam, nu, the, english, word, is, traditionally, pronounced, k, m, n, kum, in, like, coming, with, an, n, instead, of, ng, american, lexicographer, grant, barrett, notes, that, this, pronunciation, now, is, rarely, used, replaced, in, the, late, 20th, century, by, hyperforeignized, k, ju, m, n, kyoo, min, and, k, u, m, n, koo, min, cumin, is, the, dried, seed, of, the, herb, cuminum, cyminum, a, member, of, the, parsley, family, the, cumin, plant, grows, to, 30, 50, cm, 12, 20, in, tall, and, is, harvested, by, hand, it, is, an, annual, herbaceous, plant, with, a, slender, glabrous, branched, stem, that, is, 20, 30, cm, 8, 12, in, tall, and, has, a, diameter, of, 3, 5, cm, 1, 1, 4, 2, in, each, branch, has, two, to, three, sub, branches, all, the, branches, attain, the, same, height, so, the, plant, has, a, uniform, canopy, the, stem, is, colored, grey, or, dark, green, the, leaves, are, 5, 10, cm, 2, 4, in, long, pinnate, or, bipinnate, with, thread, like, leaflets, the, flowers, are, small, white, or, pink, and, borne, in, umbels, each, umbel, has, five, to, seven, umbellets, the, fruit, is, a, lateral, fusiform, or, ovoid, achene, 4, 5, mm, 1, 6, 1, 5, in, long, containing, two, mericarps, with, a, single, seed, cumin, seeds, have, eight, ridges, with, oil, canals, they, resemble, caraway, seeds, being, oblong, in, shape, longitudinally, ridged, and, yellow, brown, in, color, like, other, members, of, the, family, apiaceae, umbelliferae, such, as, caraway, parsley, and, dill, cumin, is, sometimes, confused, with, caraway, carum, carvi, another, spice, in, the, parsley, family, apiaceae, many, european, and, asian, languages, do, not, distinguish, clearly, between, the, two, for, example, in, indonesia, both, are, called, jinten, many, slavic, and, uralic, languages, refer, to, cumin, as, roman, caraway, or, spice, caraway, the, distantly, related, bunium, persicum, and, bunium, bulbocastanum, and, the, unrelated, nigella, sativa, are, both, sometimes, called, black, cumin, q, v, likely, originating, in, central, asia, southwestern, asia, or, the, eastern, mediterranean, cumin, has, been, in, use, as, a, spice, for, thousands, of, years, seeds, of, wild, cumin, were, excavated, in, the, now, submerged, settlement, of, atlit, yam, dated, to, the, early, 6th, millennium, bc, seeds, excavated, in, syria, were, dated, to, the, second, millennium, bc, they, have, also, been, reported, from, several, new, kingdom, levels, of, ancient, egyptian, archaeological, sites, in, the, ancient, egyptian, civilization, cumin, was, used, as, a, spice, and, as, a, preservative, in, mummification, cumin, was, a, significant, spice, for, the, minoans, in, ancient, crete, ideograms, for, cumin, appear, in, linear, a, archive, tablets, documenting, minoan, palace, stores, during, the, late, minoan, period, the, ancient, greeks, kept, cumin, at, the, dining, table, in, its, own, container, much, as, pepper, is, frequently, kept, today, and, this, practice, continues, in, morocco, cumin, was, also, used, heavily, in, ancient, roman, cuisine, in, india, it, has, been, used, for, millennia, as, a, traditional, ingredient, in, innumerable, recipes, and, forms, the, basis, of, many, other, spice, blends, cumin, was, introduced, to, the, americas, by, spanish, and, portuguese, colonists, black, and, green, cumin, are, used, in, persian, cuisine, today, the, plant, is, mostly, grown, in, the, indian, subcontinent, northern, africa, mexico, chile, and, china, since, cumin, is, often, used, as, part, of, bird, food, and, exported, to, many, countries, the, plant, can, occur, as, an, introduced, species, in, many, territories, india, is, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, cumin, accounting, for, about, 70, the, other, major, cumin, producing, countries, are, syria, 13, turkey, 5, uae, 3, and, iran, india, produced, 856, 000, tons, of, cumin, seed, in, the, 2020, 2021, fiscal, year, cumin, is, a, drought, tolerant, tropical, or, subtropical, crop, it, is, vulnerable, to, frost, and, has, a, growth, season, of, 120, frost, free, days, the, optimum, growth, temperature, ranges, are, between, 25, and, 30, c, 77, and, 86, f, the, mediterranean, climate, is, most, suitable, for, its, growth, cultivation, of, cumin, requires, a, long, hot, summer, of, three, to, four, months, at, low, temperatures, the, leaf, color, changes, from, green, to, purple, high, temperatures, might, reduce, growth, period, and, induce, early, ripening, in, india, cumin, is, sown, from, october, until, the, beginning, of, december, and, harvesting, starts, in, february, in, syria, and, iran, cumin, is, sown, from, mid, november, until, mid, december, extensions, up, to, mid, january, are, possible, and, harvested, in, june, july, the, three, noteworthy, sorts, of, cumin, seeds, in, the, market, vary, in, seed, shading, amount, of, oil, and, flavor, cumin, is, grown, from, seeds, the, seeds, need, 2, to, 5, c, 36, to, 41, f, for, emergence, an, optimum, of, 20, 30, c, 68, 86, f, is, suggested, cumin, is, vulnerable, to, frost, damage, especially, at, flowering, and, early, seed, formation, stages, methods, to, reduce, frost, damage, are, spraying, with, sulfuric, acid, 0, 1, irrigating, the, crop, prior, to, frost, incidence, setting, up, windbreaks, or, creating, an, early, morning, smoke, cover, the, seedlings, of, cumin, are, rather, small, and, their, vigor, is, low, soaking, the, seeds, for, 8, hours, before, sowing, enhances, germination, for, an, optimal, plant, population, a, sowing, density, of, 12, 15, kilograms, per, hectare, 11, 13, lb, acre, is, recommended, fertile, sandy, loamy, soils, with, good, aeration, proper, drainage, and, high, oxygen, availability, are, preferred, the, ph, optimum, of, the, soil, ranges, from, 6, 8, to, 8, 3, cumin, seedlings, are, sensitive, to, salinity, and, emergence, from, heavy, soils, is, rather, difficult, therefore, a, proper, seedbed, preparation, smooth, bed, is, crucial, for, the, optimal, establishment, of, cumin, two, sowing, methods, are, used, for, cumin, broadcasting, and, line, sowing, for, broadcast, sowing, the, field, is, divided, into, beds, and, the, seeds, are, uniformly, broadcast, in, this, bed, afterwards, they, are, covered, with, soil, using, a, rake, for, line, sowing, shallow, furrows, are, prepared, with, hooks, at, a, distance, of, 20, to, 25, cm, 8, to, 10, in, the, seeds, are, then, placed, in, these, furrows, and, covered, with, soil, line, sowing, offers, advantages, for, intercultural, operations, such, as, weeding, hoeing, or, spraying, the, recommended, sowing, depth, is, 1, 2, cm, and, the, recommended, sowing, density, is, around, 120, plants, per, m, 2, the, water, requirements, of, cumin, are, lower, than, those, of, many, other, species, despite, this, cumin, is, often, irrigated, after, sowing, to, be, sure, that, enough, moisture, is, available, for, seedling, development, the, amount, and, frequency, of, irrigation, depends, on, the, climate, conditions, the, relative, humidity, in, the, center, of, origin, of, cumin, is, rather, low, high, relative, humidity, i, e, wet, years, favors, fungal, diseases, cumin, is, especially, sensitive, to, alternaria, blight, and, fusarium, wilt, early, sown, crops, exhibit, stronger, disease, effects, than, late, sown, crops, the, most, important, disease, is, fusarium, wilt, resulting, in, yield, losses, up, to, 80, fusarium, is, seed, or, soil, borne, and, it, requires, distinct, soil, temperatures, for, the, development, of, epidemics, inadequate, fertilization, might, favor, fusarium, epidemics, cumin, blight, alternaria, appears, in, the, form, of, dark, brown, spots, on, leaves, and, stems, when, the, weather, is, cloudy, after, flowering, the, incidence, of, the, disease, is, increased, another, but, less, important, disease, is, powdery, mildew, incidence, of, powdery, mildew, in, early, development, can, cause, drastic, yield, losses, because, no, seeds, are, formed, later, in, development, powdery, mildew, causes, discolored, small, seeds, pathogens, can, lead, to, high, reductions, in, crop, yield, cumin, can, be, attacked, by, aphids, myzus, persicae, at, the, flowering, stage, they, suck, the, sap, of, the, plant, from, tender, parts, and, flowers, the, plant, becomes, yellow, the, seed, formation, is, reduced, yield, reduction, and, the, quality, of, the, harvested, product, decreases, heavily, infested, plant, parts, should, be, removed, other, important, pests, are, the, mites, petrobia, latens, which, frequently, attack, the, crop, since, the, mites, mostly, feed, on, young, leaves, the, infestation, is, more, severe, on, young, inflorescences, the, open, canopy, of, cumin, is, another, problem, only, a, low, proportion, of, the, incoming, light, is, absorbed, the, leaf, area, index, of, cumin, is, low, about, 1, 5, this, might, be, a, problem, because, weeds, can, compete, with, cumin, for, essential, resources, such, as, water, and, light, and, thereby, lower, yield, the, slow, growth, and, the, short, stature, of, cumin, favors, weed, competition, additionally, two, hoeing, and, weeding, sessions, 30, and, 60, days, after, sowing, are, needed, for, the, control, of, weeds, during, the, first, weeding, session, 30, days, after, sowing, thinning, should, be, done, as, well, to, remove, excess, plants, the, use, of, preplant, or, pre, emergence, herbicides, is, very, effective, in, india, but, this, kind, of, herbicide, application, requires, soil, moisture, for, a, successful, weed, control, cumin, is, a, diploid, species, with, 14, chromosomes, i, e, 2n, 14, the, chromosomes, of, the, different, varieties, have, morphological, similarities, with, no, distinct, variation, in, length, and, volume, most, of, the, varieties, available, today, are, selections, the, variabilities, of, yield, and, yield, components, are, high, varieties, are, developed, by, sib, mating, in, enclosed, chambers, or, by, biotechnology, cumin, is, a, cross, pollinator, i, e, the, breeds, are, already, hybrids, therefore, methods, used, for, breeding, are, in, vitro, regenerations, dna, technologies, and, gene, transfers, the, in, vitro, cultivation, of, cumin, allows, the, production, of, genetically, identical, plants, the, main, sources, for, the, explants, used, in, vitro, regenerations, are, embryos, hypocotyl, shoot, internodes, leaves, and, cotyledons, one, goal, of, cumin, breeding, is, to, improve, its, resistance, to, biotic, fungal, diseases, and, abiotic, cold, drought, salinity, stresses, the, potential, genetic, variability, for, conventional, breeding, of, cumin, is, limited, and, research, about, cumin, genetics, is, scarce, cumin, seed, is, used, as, a, spice, for, its, distinctive, flavor, and, aroma, cumin, can, be, found, in, some, cheeses, such, as, leyden, cheese, and, in, some, traditional, breads, from, france, cumin, can, be, an, ingredient, in, chili, powder, often, tex, mex, or, mexican, style, and, is, found, in, achiote, blends, adobos, sofrito, garam, masala, curry, powder, and, bahaarat, and, is, used, to, flavor, numerous, commercial, food, products, in, indian, and, other, south, asian, cuisine, it, is, often, combined, with, coriander, seeds, in, a, powdered, mixture, called, dhana, jeera, cumin, can, be, used, ground, or, as, whole, seeds, it, imparts, an, earthy, warming, and, aromatic, character, to, food, making, it, a, staple, in, certain, stews, and, soups, as, well, as, spiced, gravies, such, as, curry, and, chili, it, is, also, used, as, an, ingredient, in, some, pickles, and, pastries, in, india, the, seeds, are, powdered, and, used, in, different, forms, such, as, kashaya, decoction, arishta, fermented, decoction, and, vati, tablet, pills, and, processed, with, ghee, a, semifluid, clarified, butter, in, traditional, medicine, practices, of, several, countries, dried, cumin, seeds, are, believed, to, have, medicinal, purposes, although, there, is, no, scientific, evidence, for, any, use, as, a, drug, or, medicine, cuminaldehyde, cymene, and, terpenoids, are, the, major, volatile, components, of, cumin, oil, which, is, used, for, a, variety, of, flavors, perfumes, and, essential, oil, cumin, oil, may, be, used, as, an, ingredient, in, some, cosmetics, cumin, s, flavor, and, warm, aroma, are, due, to, its, essential, oil, content, primarily, the, aroma, compound, cuminaldehyde, other, aroma, compounds, of, toasted, cumin, are, the, substituted, pyrazines, 2, ethoxy, 3, isopropylpyrazine, 2, methoxy, 3, sec, butylpyrazine, and, 2, methoxy, 3, methylpyrazine, other, components, include, terpinene, safranal, p, cymene, and, pinene, in, a, reference, amount, of, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, cumin, seeds, provide, high, amounts, of, the, daily, value, for, fat, especially, monounsaturated, fat, protein, and, dietary, fiber, table, b, vitamins, vitamin, e, and, several, dietary, minerals, especially, iron, magnesium, and, manganese, are, present, in, substantial, daily, value, amounts
