the, pecan, p, k, n, pih, kan, also, us, p, k, n, p, i, k, n, pih, kahn, pee, kan, uk, p, i, k, n, pee, k, n, carya, illinoinensis, is, a, species, of, hickory, native, to, the, southern, united, states, and, northern, mexico, in, the, region, of, the, mississippi, river, the, tree, is, cultivated, for, its, seed, primarily, in, the, u, s, states, of, georgia, new, mexico, and, texas, and, in, mexico, the, seed, is, an, edible, nut, used, as, a, snack, and, in, various, recipes, such, as, praline, candy, and, pecan, pie, the, pecan, is, the, state, nut, of, alabama, arkansas, california, texas, and, louisiana, and, is, also, the, state, tree, of, texas, pecan, derives, from, an, algonquian, word, variously, referring, to, pecans, walnuts, and, hickory, nuts, there, are, many, pronunciations, some, regional, and, others, not, there, is, little, agreement, in, the, united, states, regarding, the, correct, pronunciation, even, regionally, in, 1927, however, the, national, pecan, growers, association, acknowledged, variant, pronunciations, while, designating, one, as, official, and, correct, pronounced, as, though, spelled, pea, con, those, in, the, habit, of, using, any, other, pronunciation, therefore, be, requested, henceforth, to, adopt, exclusively, the, pronunciation, above, specified, above, and, hereby, adopted, by, the, association, the, pecan, tree, is, a, large, deciduous, tree, growing, to, 20, 40, m, 66, 131, ft, in, height, rarely, to, 44, m, 144, ft, it, typically, has, a, spread, of, 12, 23, m, 39, 75, ft, with, a, trunk, up, to, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, diameter, a, 10, year, old, sapling, grown, in, optimal, conditions, will, stand, about, 5, m, 16, ft, tall, the, leaves, are, alternate, 30, 45, cm, 12, 18, in, long, and, pinnate, with, 9, 17, leaflets, each, leaflet, 5, 12, cm, 2, 4, 1, 2, in, long, and, 2, 6, cm, 1, 2, 1, 2, in, broad, a, pecan, like, the, fruit, of, all, other, members, of, the, hickory, genus, is, not, truly, a, nut, but, is, technically, a, drupe, a, fruit, with, a, single, stone, or, pit, surrounded, by, a, husk, the, husks, are, produced, from, the, exocarp, tissue, of, the, flower, while, the, part, known, as, the, nut, develops, from, the, endocarp, and, contains, the, seed, the, husk, itself, is, aeneous, that, is, brassy, greenish, gold, in, color, oval, to, oblong, in, shape, 2, 6, 6, cm, 1, 2, 3, 8, in, long, and, 1, 5, 3, cm, 5, 8, 1, 1, 8, in, broad, the, outer, husk, is, 3, 4, mm, 1, 8, 5, 32, in, thick, starts, out, green, and, turns, brown, at, maturity, at, which, time, it, splits, off, in, four, sections, to, release, the, thin, shelled, seed, pecans, are, one, of, the, most, recently, domesticated, of, the, major, crops, although, wild, pecans, were, well, known, among, native, and, colonial, americans, as, a, delicacy, the, commercial, growth, of, pecans, in, the, united, states, did, not, begin, until, the, 1880s, as, of, 2014, the, united, states, produced, an, annual, crop, of, 119, 8, million, kilograms, 264, 2, million, pounds, with, 75, of, the, total, crop, produced, in, georgia, new, mexico, and, texas, they, can, be, grown, from, usda, hardiness, zones, approximately, 5, to, 9, and, grow, best, where, summers, are, long, hot, and, humid, the, nut, harvest, for, growers, is, typically, around, mid, october, outside, the, united, states, mexico, produces, nearly, half, of, the, world, s, total, similar, in, volume, to, the, united, states, together, accounting, for, 93, of, global, production, pecan, trees, require, large, quantities, of, water, during, the, growing, season, and, most, orchards, in, the, region, use, flood, irrigation, to, optimize, consumptive, water, use, and, production, of, mature, pecans, generally, two, or, more, trees, of, different, cultivars, must, be, present, to, pollinate, each, other, choosing, cultivars, can, be, a, complex, practice, based, on, the, alternate, bearing, index, abi, and, their, period, of, pollinating, commercial, growers, are, most, concerned, with, the, abi, which, describes, a, cultivar, s, likelihood, to, bear, on, alternating, years, index, of, 1, 0, signifies, the, highest, likelihood, of, bearing, little, to, nothing, every, other, year, the, period, of, pollination, groups, all, cultivars, into, two, families, those, that, shed, pollen, before, they, can, receive, pollen, protandrous, and, those, that, shed, pollen, after, becoming, receptive, to, pollen, protogynous, state, level, resources, provide, recommended, varieties, for, specific, regions, native, pecans, in, mexico, are, adapted, from, zone, 9, to, zone, 11, little, or, no, breeding, work, has, been, done, with, these, populations, a, few, selections, from, native, stands, have, been, made, such, as, frutosa, and, norte, a, which, are, recommended, for, cultivation, in, mexico, improved, varieties, recommended, for, cultivation, in, mexico, are, usda, developed, cultivars, this, represents, a, gap, in, breeding, development, given, that, native, pecans, can, be, cultivated, at, least, down, to, the, yucat, n, peninsula, while, the, usda, cultivars, have, chilling, hour, requirements, greater, than, those, occurring, in, much, of, the, region, some, regions, of, the, u, s, such, as, parts, of, florida, and, puerto, rico, are, zone, 10, or, higher, and, these, regions, have, limited, options, for, pecan, cultivation, western, is, the, only, commonly, available, variety, that, can, make, a, crop, in, low, chill, zones, active, breeding, and, selection, is, carried, out, by, the, usda, agricultural, research, service, with, growing, locations, at, brownwood, and, college, station, texas, university, of, georgia, has, a, breeding, program, at, the, tifton, campus, working, on, selecting, pecan, varieties, adapted, to, subtropical, southeastern, u, s, growing, conditions, while, selection, work, has, been, done, since, the, late, 19th, century, most, acreage, of, pecans, grown, today, is, of, older, cultivars, such, as, stuart, schley, elliott, and, desirable, with, known, flaws, but, also, with, known, production, potential, cultivars, such, as, elliot, are, increasing, in, popularity, due, to, resistance, to, pecan, scab, the, long, cycle, time, for, pecan, trees, plus, financial, considerations, dictate, that, new, varieties, go, through, an, extensive, vetting, process, before, being, widely, planted, numerous, varieties, produce, well, in, texas, but, fail, in, the, southeastern, u, s, due, to, increased, disease, pressure, selection, programs, are, ongoing, at, the, state, level, with, alabama, arkansas, florida, georgia, kansas, missouri, new, mexico, and, others, having, trial, plantings, varieties, adapted, from, the, southern, tier, of, states, north, through, some, parts, of, iowa, and, even, into, southern, canada, are, available, from, nurseries, production, potential, drops, significantly, when, planted, further, north, than, tennessee, most, breeding, efforts, for, northern, adapted, varieties, have, not, been, on, a, large, enough, scale, to, significantly, affect, production, varieties, that, are, available, and, adapted, e, g, major, martzahn, witte, greenriver, mullahy, and, posey, in, zones, 6, and, farther, north, are, almost, entirely, selections, from, wild, stands, kanza, a, northern, adapted, release, from, the, usda, breeding, program, is, a, grafted, pecan, having, high, productivity, and, quality, and, cold, tolerance, pecans, are, subject, to, various, diseases, pests, and, physiological, disorders, that, can, limit, tree, growth, and, fruit, production, these, range, from, scab, to, hickory, shuckworm, to, shuck, decline, pecans, are, prone, to, infection, by, bacteria, and, fungi, such, as, pecan, scab, especially, in, humid, conditions, scab, is, the, most, destructive, disease, affecting, pecan, trees, untreated, with, fungicides, recommendations, for, preventive, spray, materials, and, schedules, are, available, from, state, level, resources, various, insects, feed, on, the, leaves, stems, and, developing, nuts, these, include, ambrosia, beetles, twig, girdlers, pecan, nut, casebearer, hickory, shuckworm, phylloxera, curculio, weevils, and, several, aphid, species, in, the, southeastern, united, states, nickel, deficiency, in, c, illinoinensis, produces, a, disorder, called, mouse, ear, in, trees, fertilized, with, urea, similarly, zinc, deficiency, causes, rosetting, of, the, leaves, various, other, disorders, are, documented, including, canker, disease, and, shuck, decline, complex, pecan, seeds, are, edible, with, a, rich, buttery, flavor, they, can, be, eaten, fresh, roasted, or, used, in, cooking, particularly, in, sweet, desserts, such, as, pecan, pie, a, traditional, southern, u, s, dish, butter, pecan, is, also, a, common, flavor, in, cookies, cakes, and, ice, creams, pecans, are, a, significant, ingredient, in, american, praline, candy, other, applications, of, cooking, with, pecans, include, pecan, oil, and, pecan, butter, pecan, wood, is, used, in, making, furniture, and, wood, flooring, as, well, as, flavoring, fuel, for, smoking, meats, giving, grilled, foods, a, sweet, and, nutty, flavor, stronger, than, many, fruit, woods, a, pecan, nut, is, 4, water, 72, fat, 9, protein, and, 14, carbohydrates, see, table, in, a,

monounsaturated, fatty, acids, mainly, oleic, acid, 57, of, total, fat, and, the, polyunsaturated, fatty, acid, linoleic, acid, 30, of, total, fat, the, pecan, carya, illinoinensis, is, a, member, of, the, juglandaceae, family, juglandaceae, are, represented, worldwide, by, seven, and, ten, extant, genera, and, more, than, 60, species, most, of, these, species, are, concentrated, in, the, northern, hemisphere, of, the, new, world, but, some, can, be, found, on, every, continent, except, antarctica, the, first, fossil, examples, of, the, family, appear, during, the, cretaceous, differentiation, between, the, subfamilies, of, engelhardioideae, and, juglandioideae, occurred, during, the, early, paleogene, about, 64, million, years, ago, extant, examples, of, engelhardioideae, are, generally, tropical, and, evergreen, while, those, of, juglandioideae, are, deciduous, and, found, in, more, temperate, zones, the, second, major, step, in, the, development, of, pecan, was, a, change, from, wind, dispersed, fruits, to, animal, dispersion, this, dispersal, strategy, coincides, with, developing, a, husk, around, the, fruit, and, a, drastic, change, in, the, relative, concentrations, of, fatty, acids, the, ratio, of, oleic, to, linoleic, acids, is, inverted, between, wind, and, animal, dispersed, seeds, further, differentiation, from, other, species, of, juglandaceae, occurred, about, 44, million, years, ago, during, the, eocene, the, fruits, of, the, pecan, genus, carya, differ, from, those, of, the, walnut, genus, juglans, only, in, the, formation, of, the, husk, of, the, fruit, the, husks, of, walnuts, develop, from, the, bracts, bracteoles, and, sepals, or, sepals, only, the, husks, of, pecans, develop, from, the, bracts, and, the, bracteoles, only, before, european, settlement, pecans, were, widely, consumed, and, traded, by, native, americans, as, a, wild, forage, the, fruit, of, the, previous, growing, season, is, commonly, still, edible, when, found, on, the, ground, pecans, first, became, known, to, europeans, in, the, 16th, century, the, first, europeans, to, come, into, contact, with, pecans, were, spanish, explorers, in, what, is, now, louisiana, texas, and, mexico, these, spanish, explorers, called, the, pecan, nuez, de, la, arruga, which, roughly, translates, to, wrinkle, nut, because, of, their, familiarity, with, the, genus, juglans, these, early, explorers, referred, to, the, nuts, as, nogales, and, nueces, the, spanish, terms, for, walnut, trees, and, fruit, of, the, walnut, they, noted, the, particularly, thin, shell, and, acorn, like, shape, of, the, fruit, indicating, they, were, referring, to, pecans, the, spaniards, took, the, pecan, into, europe, asia, and, africa, in, the, 16th, century, in, 1792, william, bartram, reported, in, his, botanical, book, travels, a, nut, tree, juglans, exalata, that, some, botanists, today, argue, was, the, american, pecan, tree, still, others, argue, hickory, carya, ovata, pecan, trees, are, native, to, the, united, states, and, writing, about, the, pecan, tree, goes, back, to, the, nation, s, founders, thomas, jefferson, planted, pecan, trees, c, illinoinensis, illinois, nuts, in, his, nut, orchard, at, his, home, monticello, in, virginia, george, washington, reported, in, his, journal, that, thomas, jefferson, gave, him, illinois, nuts, pecans, which, washington, then, grew, at, mount, vernon, his, virginia, home, commercial, production, of, pecans, was, slow, because, trees, were, slow, to, mature, and, bear, fruit, more, importantly, the, trees, grown, from, the, nuts, of, one, tree, have, very, diverse, characters, to, speed, nut, production, and, retain, the, best, tree, characteristics, grafting, from, mature, productive, trees, was, the, apparent, strategy, however, this, proved, technically, challenging, the, centennial, cultivar, was, the, first, to, be, successfully, grafted, this, was, accomplished, by, an, enslaved, person, called, antoine, in, 1846, or, 1847, who, was, owned, by, jacques, telesphore, roman, of, the, oak, alley, plantation, near, the, mississippi, river, the, scions, were, supplied, by, dr, a, e, colomb, who, had, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, graft, them, pecan, is, a, 32, chromosome, species, 1n, 16, that, readily, hybridizes, with, other, 32, chromosome, members, of, the, carya, genus, such, as, carya, ovata, carya, laciniosa, carya, cordiformis, and, has, been, reported, to, hybridize, with, 64, chromosome, species, such, as, carya, tomentosa, most, such, hybrids, are, unproductive, hybrids, are, referred, to, as, hicans, to, indicate, their, hybrid, origin, recent, efforts, at, nmsu, to, complete, a, pecan, genome, showed, that, dna, introgressed, from, c, aquatica, water, hickory, c, myristiciformis, nutmeg, hickory, and, c, cordiformis, bitternut, hickory, is, present, in, commercial, pecan, varieties, grown, today, in, 1919, the, 36th, texas, legislature, made, the, pecan, tree, the, state, tree, of, texas, in, 2001, the, pecan, was, declared, the, state, s, official, health, nut, and, in, 2013, pecan, pie, was, made, the, state, s, official, pie, the, town, of, san, saba, texas, claims, to, be, the, pecan, capital, of, the, world, and, is, the, site, of, the, mother, tree, c, 1850, considered, to, be, the, source, of, the, state, s, production, through, its, progeny,
