the, cucumber, cucumis, sativus, is, a, widely, cultivated, creeping, vine, plant, in, the, family, cucurbitaceae, that, bears, cylindrical, to, spherical, fruits, which, are, used, as, culinary, vegetables, considered, an, annual, plant, there, are, three, main, types, of, cucumber, slicing, pickling, and, seedless, within, which, several, cultivars, have, been, created, the, cucumber, originates, in, asia, extending, from, india, nepal, bangladesh, china, yunnan, guizhou, guangxi, and, northern, thailand, but, now, grows, on, most, continents, and, many, different, types, of, cucumber, are, grown, commercially, and, traded, on, the, global, market, in, north, america, the, term, wild, cucumber, refers, to, plants, in, the, genera, echinocystis, and, marah, though, the, two, are, not, closely, related, the, cucumber, is, a, creeping, vine, that, roots, in, the, ground, and, grows, up, trellises, or, other, supporting, frames, wrapping, around, supports, with, thin, spiraling, tendrils, the, plant, may, also, root, in, a, soilless, medium, whereby, it, will, sprawl, along, the, ground, in, lieu, of, a, supporting, structure, the, vine, has, large, leaves, that, form, a, canopy, over, the, fruits, the, fruit, of, typical, cultivars, of, cucumber, is, roughly, cylindrical, but, elongated, with, tapered, ends, and, may, be, as, large, as, 62, centimeters, 24, in, long, and, 10, centimeters, 4, in, in, diameter, cucumber, fruits, consist, of, 95, water, see, nutrition, table, in, botanical, terms, the, cucumber, is, classified, as, a, pepo, a, type, of, botanical, berry, with, a, hard, outer, rind, and, no, internal, divisions, however, much, like, tomatoes, and, squashes, it, is, often, perceived, prepared, and, eaten, as, a, vegetable, most, cucumber, cultivars, are, seeded, and, require, pollination, for, this, purpose, thousands, of, honey, beehives, are, annually, carried, to, cucumber, fields, just, before, bloom, cucumbers, may, also, be, pollinated, via, bumblebees, and, several, other, bee, species, most, cucumbers, that, require, pollination, are, self, incompatible, thus, requiring, the, pollen, of, another, plant, in, order, to, form, seeds, and, fruit, some, self, compatible, cultivars, exist, that, are, related, to, the, lemon, cucumber, cultivar, a, few, cultivars, of, cucumber, are, parthenocarpic, the, blossoms, of, which, create, seedless, fruit, without, pollination, which, degrades, the, eating, quality, of, these, cultivar, in, the, united, states, these, are, usually, grown, in, greenhouses, where, bees, are, excluded, in, europe, they, are, grown, outdoors, in, some, regions, where, bees, are, likewise, excluded, traditional, cultivars, produce, male, blossoms, first, then, female, in, about, equivalent, numbers, newer, gynoecious, hybrid, cultivars, produce, almost, all, female, blossoms, they, may, have, a, pollenizer, cultivar, interplanted, and, the, number, of, beehives, per, unit, area, is, increased, but, temperature, changes, induce, male, flowers, even, on, these, plants, which, may, be, sufficient, for, pollination, to, occur, in, 2009, an, international, team, of, researchers, announced, they, had, sequenced, the, cucumber, genome, a, study, of, genetic, recombination, during, meiosis, in, cucumber, provided, a, high, resolution, landscape, of, meiotic, dna, double, strand, breaks, and, genetic, crossovers, the, average, number, of, crossovers, per, chromosome, per, meiosis, was, 0, 92, to, 0, 99, phytochemicals, in, cucumbers, may, discourage, natural, foraging, by, herbivores, such, as, insects, nematodes, or, wildlife, as, a, possible, defense, mechanism, cucumbers, produce, cucurbitacin, c, which, causes, a, bitter, taste, in, some, cucumber, varieties, this, potential, mechanism, is, under, preliminary, research, to, identify, whether, cucumbers, are, able, to, deter, herbivores, and, environmental, stresses, by, using, an, intrinsic, chemical, defense, particularly, in, the, leaves, cotyledons, pedicel, carpopodium, and, fruit, raw, cucumber, with, peel, is, 95, water, 4, carbohydrates, 1, protein, and, contains, negligible, fat, a, 100, gram, 3, 1, 2, ounce, reference, serving, provides, 65, kilojoules, 16, kilocalories, of, food, energy, it, has, a, low, content, of, micronutrients, it, is, notable, only, for, vitamin, k, at, 14, of, the, daily, value, table, depending, on, variety, cucumbers, may, have, a, mild, melon, aroma, and, flavor, in, part, resulting, from, unsaturated, aldehydes, such, as, e, z, nona, 2, 6, dienal, and, the, cis, and, trans, isomers, of, 2, nonenal, the, slightly, bitter, taste, of, cucumber, rind, results, from, cucurbitacins, in, general, cultivation, cucumbers, are, classified, into, three, main, cultivar, groups, slicing, pickled, and, seedless, burpless, cucumbers, grown, to, eat, fresh, are, called, slicing, cucumbers, the, main, varieties, of, slicers, mature, on, vines, with, large, leaves, that, provide, shading, slicers, grown, commercially, for, the, north, american, market, are, generally, longer, smoother, more, uniform, in, color, and, have, much, tougher, skin, in, contrast, those, in, other, countries, often, called, european, cucumbers, are, smaller, and, have, thinner, more, delicate, skin, often, with, fewer, seeds, thus, are, often, sold, in, plastic, skin, for, protection, this, variety, may, also, be, called, a, telegraph, cucumber, particularly, in, australasia, pickling, with, brine, sugar, vinegar, and, spices, creates, various, flavored, products, from, cucumbers, and, other, foods, although, any, cucumber, can, be, pickled, commercial, pickles, are, made, from, cucumbers, specially, bred, for, uniformity, of, length, to, diameter, ratio, and, lack, of, voids, in, the, flesh, those, cucumbers, intended, for, pickling, called, picklers, grow, to, about, 7, to, 10, cm, 3, to, 4, in, long, and, 2, 5, cm, 1, in, wide, compared, to, slicers, picklers, tend, to, be, shorter, thicker, less, regularly, shaped, and, have, bumpy, skin, with, tiny, white, or, black, dotted, spines, color, can, vary, from, creamy, yellow, to, pale, or, dark, green, gherkins, also, called, cornichons, or, baby, pickles, are, small, cucumbers, typically, those, 2, 5, to, 12, 5, centimetres, 1, to, 5, in, in, length, often, with, bumpy, skin, which, are, typically, used, for, pickling, the, word, gherkin, comes, from, the, early, modern, dutch, gurken, or, augurken, small, pickled, cucumber, the, term, is, also, used, in, the, name, for, cucumis, anguria, the, west, indian, gherkin, a, closely, related, species, burpless, cucumbers, are, sweeter, and, have, a, thinner, skin, than, other, varieties, of, cucumber, they, are, reputed, to, be, easy, to, digest, and, to, have, a, pleasant, taste, they, can, grow, as, long, as, 60, centimeters, 2, ft, are, nearly, seedless, and, have, a, delicate, skin, most, commonly, grown, in, greenhouses, these, parthenocarpic, cucumbers, are, often, found, in, grocery, markets, shrink, wrapped, in, plastic, they, are, marketed, as, either, burpless, or, seedless, as, the, seeds, and, skin, of, other, varieties, of, cucumbers, are, said, to, give, some, people, gas, in, 2022, world, production, of, cucumbers, and, gherkins, was, 95, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 82, of, the, total, cultivated, for, at, least, 3, 000, years, the, cultivated, cucumbers, cucumis, sativus, were, domesticated, in, india, from, wild, c, sativus, var, hardwickii, where, a, great, many, varieties, have, been, observed, along, with, its, closest, living, relative, cucumis, hystrix, three, main, cultivar, groups, of, cucumber, are, namely, eurasian, cucumbers, slicing, cucumbers, eaten, raw, and, immature, east, asian, cucumbers, pickling, cucumbers, and, xishuangbanna, cucumbers, based, on, demographic, modelling, the, east, asian, c, sativus, cultivars, diverged, from, the, indian, cultivars, c, 2500, years, ago, it, was, probably, introduced, to, europe, by, the, greeks, or, romans, records, of, cucumber, cultivation, appear, in, france, in, the, 9th, century, england, in, the, 14th, century, and, in, north, america, by, the, mid, 16th, century, according, to, pliny, the, elder, the, emperor, tiberius, had, the, cucumber, on, his, table, daily, during, summer, and, winter, in, order, to, have, it, available, for, his, table, every, day, of, the, year, the, romans, reportedly, used, artificial, methods, of, growing, similar, to, the, greenhouse, system, whereby, mirrorstone, refers, to, pliny, s, lapis, specularis, believed, to, have, been, sheet, mica, indeed, he, was, never, without, it, for, he, had, raised, beds, made, in, frames, upon, wheels, by, means, of, which, the, cucumbers, were, moved, and, exposed, to, the, full, heat, of, the, sun, while, in, winter, they, were, withdrawn, and, placed, under, the, protection, of, frames, glazed, with, mirrorstone, reportedly, they, were, also, cultivated, in, specularia, cucumber, houses, glazed, with, oiled, cloth, pliny, describes, the, italian, fruit, as, very, small, probably, like, a, gherkin, he, also, describes, the, preparation, of, a, medication, known, as, elaterium, however, some, scholars, believe, that, he, was, instead, referring, to, ecballium, elaterium, known, in, pre, linnean, times, as, cucumis, silvestris, or, cucumis, asininus, wild, cucumber, or, donkey, cucumber, a, species, different, from, the, common, cucumber, pliny, also, writes, about, several, other, varieties, of, cucumber, including, the, cultivated, cucumber, and, remedies, from, the, different, types, 9, from, the, cultivated, 5, from, the, anguine, and, 26, from, the, wild, charlemagne, had, cucumbers, grown, in, his, gardens, in, the, 8th, 9th, century, they, were, reportedly, introduced, into, england, in, the, early, 14th, century, lost, then, reintroduced, approximately, 250, years, later, the, spaniards, through, the, italian, christopher, columbus, brought, cucumbers, to, haiti, in, 1494, in, 1535, jacques, cartier, a, french, explorer, found, very, great, cucumbers, grown, on, the, site, of, what, is, now, montreal, throughout, the, 16th, century, european, trappers, traders, bison, hunters, and, explorers, bartered, for, the, products, of, american, indian, agriculture, the, tribes, of, the, great, plains, and, the, rocky, mountains, learned, from, the, spanish, how, to, grow, european, crops, the, farmers, on, the, great, plains, included, the, mandan, and, abenaki, they, obtained, cucumbers, and, watermelons, from, the, spanish, and, added, them, to, the, crops, they, were, already, growing, including, several, varieties, of, corn, and, beans, pumpkins, squash, and, gourd, plants, the, iroquois, were, also, growing, them, when, the, first, europeans, visited, them, in, 1630, the, reverend, francis, higginson, produced, a, book, called, new, englands, plantation, in, which, describing, a, garden, on, conant, s, island, in, boston, harbor, known, as, the, governor, s, garden, he, states, the, countrie, aboundeth, naturally, with, store, of, roots, of, great, varietie, and, good, to, eat, our, turnips, parsnips, and, carrots, are, here, both, bigger, and, sweeter, than, is, ordinary, to, be, found, in, england, here, are, store, of, pompions, cowcumbers, and, other, things, of, that, nature, which, i, know, not, in, new, england, prospect, 1633, england, william, wood, published, observations, he, made, in, 1629, in, america, the, ground, affords, very, good, kitchin, gardens, for, turneps, parsnips, carrots, radishes, and, pompions, muskmillons, isquoter, squashes, coucumbars, onyons, and, whatever, grows, well, in, england, grows, as, well, there, many, things, being, better, and, larger, in, the, later, 17th, century, a, prejudice, developed, against, uncooked, vegetables, and, fruits, a, number, of, articles, in, contemporary, health, publications, stated, that, uncooked, plants, brought, on, summer, diseases, and, should, be, forbidden, to, children, the, cucumber, kept, this, reputation, for, an, inordinate, period, of, time, fit, only, for, consumption, by, cows, which, some, believe, is, why, it, gained, the, name, cowcumber, samuel, pepys, wrote, in, his, diary, on, 22, august, 1663, his, day, sir, w, batten, tells, me, that, mr, newburne, is, dead, of, eating, cowcumbers, of, which, the, other, day, i, heard, of, another, i, think, john, evelyn, in, 1699, wrote, that, the, cucumber, however, dress, d, was, thought, fit, to, be, thrown, away, being, accounted, little, better, than, poyson, poison, according, to, 18th, century, british, writer, samuel, johnson, it, was, commonly, said, among, english, physicians, that, a, cucumber, should, be, well, sliced, and, dressed, with, pepper, and, vinegar, and, then, thrown, out, as, good, for, nothing, a, copper, etching, made, by, maddalena, bouchard, between, 1772, and, 1793, shows, this, plant, to, have, smaller, almost, bean, shaped, fruits, and, small, yellow, flowers, the, small, form, of, the, cucumber, is, figured, in, herbals, of, the, 16th, century, however, stating, that, f, hung, in, a, tube, while, in, blossom, the, cucumber, will, grow, to, a, most, surprising, length
