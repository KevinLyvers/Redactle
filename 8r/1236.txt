an, antibiotic, is, a, type, of, antimicrobial, substance, active, against, bacteria, it, is, the, most, important, type, of, antibacterial, agent, for, fighting, bacterial, infections, and, antibiotic, medications, are, widely, used, in, the, treatment, and, prevention, of, such, infections, they, may, either, kill, or, inhibit, the, growth, of, bacteria, a, limited, number, of, antibiotics, also, possess, antiprotozoal, activity, antibiotics, are, not, effective, against, viruses, such, as, the, ones, which, cause, the, common, cold, or, influenza, drugs, which, inhibit, growth, of, viruses, are, termed, antiviral, drugs, or, antivirals, rather, than, antibiotics, they, are, also, not, effective, against, fungi, drugs, which, inhibit, growth, of, fungi, are, called, antifungal, drugs, sometimes, the, term, antibiotic, literally, opposing, life, from, the, greek, roots, anti, against, and, bios, life, is, broadly, used, to, refer, to, any, substance, used, against, microbes, but, in, the, usual, medical, usage, antibiotics, such, as, penicillin, are, those, produced, naturally, by, one, microorganism, fighting, another, whereas, non, antibiotic, antibacterials, such, as, sulfonamides, and, antiseptics, are, fully, synthetic, however, both, classes, have, the, same, effect, of, killing, or, preventing, the, growth, of, microorganisms, and, both, are, included, in, antimicrobial, chemotherapy, antibacterials, include, bactericides, bacteriostatics, antibacterial, soaps, and, chemical, disinfectants, whereas, antibiotics, are, an, important, class, of, antibacterials, used, more, specifically, in, medicine, and, sometimes, in, livestock, feed, antibiotics, have, been, used, since, ancient, times, many, civilizations, used, topical, application, of, moldy, bread, with, many, references, to, its, beneficial, effects, arising, from, ancient, egypt, nubia, china, serbia, greece, and, rome, the, first, person, to, directly, document, the, use, of, molds, to, treat, infections, was, john, parkinson, 1567, 1650, antibiotics, revolutionized, medicine, in, the, 20th, century, synthetic, antibiotic, chemotherapy, as, a, science, and, development, of, antibacterials, began, in, germany, with, paul, ehrlich, in, the, late, 1880s, alexander, fleming, 1881, 1955, discovered, modern, day, penicillin, in, 1928, the, widespread, use, of, which, proved, significantly, beneficial, during, wartime, the, first, sulfonamide, and, the, first, systemically, active, antibacterial, drug, prontosil, was, developed, by, a, research, team, led, by, gerhard, domagk, in, 1932, or, 1933, at, the, bayer, laboratories, of, the, ig, farben, conglomerate, in, germany, however, the, effectiveness, and, easy, access, to, antibiotics, have, also, led, to, their, overuse, and, some, bacteria, have, evolved, resistance, to, them, the, world, health, organization, has, classified, antimicrobial, resistance, as, a, widespread, serious, threat, is, no, longer, a, prediction, for, the, future, it, is, happening, right, now, in, every, region, of, the, world, and, has, the, potential, to, affect, anyone, of, any, age, in, any, country, global, deaths, attributable, to, antimicrobial, resistance, numbered, 1, 27, million, in, 2019, the, term, antibiosis, meaning, against, life, was, introduced, by, the, french, bacteriologist, jean, paul, vuillemin, as, a, descriptive, name, of, the, phenomenon, exhibited, by, these, early, antibacterial, drugs, antibiosis, was, first, described, in, 1877, in, bacteria, when, louis, pasteur, and, robert, koch, observed, that, an, airborne, bacillus, could, inhibit, the, growth, of, bacillus, anthracis, these, drugs, were, later, renamed, antibiotics, by, selman, waksman, an, american, microbiologist, in, 1947, the, term, antibiotic, was, first, used, in, 1942, by, selman, waksman, and, his, collaborators, in, journal, articles, to, describe, any, substance, produced, by, a, microorganism, that, is, antagonistic, to, the, growth, of, other, microorganisms, in, high, dilution, this, definition, excluded, substances, that, kill, bacteria, but, that, are, not, produced, by, microorganisms, such, as, gastric, juices, and, hydrogen, peroxide, it, also, excluded, synthetic, antibacterial, compounds, such, as, the, sulfonamides, in, current, usage, the, term, antibiotic, is, applied, to, any, medication, that, kills, bacteria, or, inhibits, their, growth, regardless, of, whether, that, medication, is, produced, by, a, microorganism, or, not, the, term, antibiotic, derives, from, anti, bi, tikos, fit, for, life, lively, which, comes, from, bi, sis, way, of, life, and, that, from, bios, life, the, term, antibacterial, derives, from, greek, anti, against, bakt, rion, diminutive, of, bakt, ria, staff, cane, because, the, first, bacteria, to, be, discovered, were, rod, shaped, antibiotics, are, used, to, treat, or, prevent, bacterial, infections, and, sometimes, protozoan, infections, metronidazole, is, effective, against, a, number, of, parasitic, diseases, when, an, infection, is, suspected, of, being, responsible, for, an, illness, but, the, responsible, pathogen, has, not, been, identified, an, empiric, therapy, is, adopted, this, involves, the, administration, of, a, broad, spectrum, antibiotic, based, on, the, signs, and, symptoms, presented, and, is, initiated, pending, laboratory, results, that, can, take, several, days, when, the, responsible, pathogenic, microorganism, is, already, known, or, has, been, identified, definitive, therapy, can, be, started, this, will, usually, involve, the, use, of, a, narrow, spectrum, antibiotic, the, choice, of, antibiotic, given, will, also, be, based, on, its, cost, identification, is, critically, important, as, it, can, reduce, the, cost, and, toxicity, of, the, antibiotic, therapy, and, also, reduce, the, possibility, of, the, emergence, of, antimicrobial, resistance, to, avoid, surgery, antibiotics, may, be, given, for, non, complicated, acute, appendicitis, antibiotics, may, be, given, as, a, preventive, measure, and, this, is, usually, limited, to, at, risk, populations, such, as, those, with, a, weakened, immune, system, particularly, in, hiv, cases, to, prevent, pneumonia, those, taking, immunosuppressive, drugs, cancer, patients, and, those, having, surgery, their, use, in, surgical, procedures, is, to, help, prevent, infection, of, incisions, they, have, an, important, role, in, dental, antibiotic, prophylaxis, where, their, use, may, prevent, bacteremia, and, consequent, infective, endocarditis, antibiotics, are, also, used, to, prevent, infection, in, cases, of, neutropenia, particularly, cancer, related, the, use, of, antibiotics, for, secondary, prevention, of, coronary, heart, disease, is, not, supported, by, current, scientific, evidence, and, may, actually, increase, cardiovascular, mortality, all, cause, mortality, and, the, occurrence, of, stroke, there, are, many, different, routes, of, administration, for, antibiotic, treatment, antibiotics, are, usually, taken, by, mouth, in, more, severe, cases, particularly, deep, seated, systemic, infections, antibiotics, can, be, given, intravenously, or, by, injection, where, the, site, of, infection, is, easily, accessed, antibiotics, may, be, given, topically, in, the, form, of, eye, drops, onto, the, conjunctiva, for, conjunctivitis, or, ear, drops, for, ear, infections, and, acute, cases, of, swimmer, s, ear, topical, use, is, also, one, of, the, treatment, options, for, some, skin, conditions, including, acne, and, cellulitis, advantages, of, topical, application, include, achieving, high, and, sustained, concentration, of, antibiotic, at, the, site, of, infection, reducing, the, potential, for, systemic, absorption, and, toxicity, and, total, volumes, of, antibiotic, required, are, reduced, thereby, also, reducing, the, risk, of, antibiotic, misuse, topical, antibiotics, applied, over, certain, types, of, surgical, wounds, have, been, reported, to, reduce, the, risk, of, surgical, site, infections, however, there, are, certain, general, causes, for, concern, with, topical, administration, of, antibiotics, some, systemic, absorption, of, the, antibiotic, may, occur, the, quantity, of, antibiotic, applied, is, difficult, to, accurately, dose, and, there, is, also, the, possibility, of, local, hypersensitivity, reactions, or, contact, dermatitis, occurring, it, is, recommended, to, administer, antibiotics, as, soon, as, possible, especially, in, life, threatening, infections, many, emergency, departments, stock, antibiotics, for, this, purpose, antibiotic, consumption, varies, widely, between, countries, the, who, report, on, surveillance, of, antibiotic, consumption, published, in, 2018, analysed, 2015, data, from, 65, countries, as, measured, in, defined, daily, doses, per, 1, 000, inhabitants, per, day, mongolia, had, the, highest, consumption, with, a, rate, of, 64, 4, burundi, had, the, lowest, at, 4, 4, amoxicillin, and, amoxicillin, clavulanic, acid, were, the, most, frequently, consumed, antibiotics, are, screened, for, any, negative, effects, before, their, approval, for, clinical, use, and, are, usually, considered, safe, and, well, tolerated, however, some, antibiotics, have, been, associated, with, a, wide, extent, of, adverse, side, effects, ranging, from, mild, to, very, severe, depending, on, the, type, of, antibiotic, used, the, microbes, targeted, and, the, individual, patient, side, effects, may, reflect, the, pharmacological, or, toxicological, properties, of, the, antibiotic, or, may, involve, hypersensitivity, or, allergic, reactions, adverse, effects, range, from, fever, and, nausea, to, major, allergic, reactions, including, photodermatitis, and, anaphylaxis, common, side, effects, of, oral, antibiotics, include, diarrhea, resulting, from, disruption, of, the, species, composition, in, the, intestinal, flora, resulting, for, example, in, overgrowth, of, pathogenic, bacteria, such, as, clostridium, difficile, taking, probiotics, during, the, course, of, antibiotic, treatment, can, help, prevent, antibiotic, associated, diarrhea, antibacterials, can, also, affect, the, vaginal, flora, and, may, lead, to, overgrowth, of, yeast, species, of, the, genus, candida, in, the, vulvo, vaginal, area, additional, side, effects, can, result, from, interaction, with, other, drugs, such, as, the, possibility, of, tendon, damage, from, the, administration, of, a, quinolone, antibiotic, with, a, systemic, corticosteroid, some, antibiotics, may, also, damage, the, mitochondrion, a, bacteria, derived, organelle, found, in, eukaryotic, including, human, cells, mitochondrial, damage, cause, oxidative, stress, in, cells, and, has, been, suggested, as, a, mechanism, for, side, effects, from, fluoroquinolones, they, are, also, known, to, affect, chloroplasts, there, are, few, well, controlled, studies, on, whether, antibiotic, use, increases, the, risk, of, oral, contraceptive, failure, the, majority, of, studies, indicate, antibiotics, do, not, interfere, with, birth, control, pills, such, as, clinical, studies, that, suggest, the, failure, rate, of, contraceptive, pills, caused, by, antibiotics, is, very, low, about, 1, situations, that, may, increase, the, risk, of, oral, contraceptive, failure, include, non, compliance, missing, taking, the, pill, vomiting, or, diarrhea, gastrointestinal, disorders, or, interpatient, variability, in, oral, contraceptive, absorption, affecting, ethinylestradiol, serum, levels, in, the, blood, women, with, menstrual, irregularities, may, be, at, higher, risk, of, failure, and, should, be, advised, to, use, backup, contraception, during, antibiotic, treatment, and, for, one, week, after, its, completion, if, patient, specific, risk, factors, for, reduced, oral, contraceptive, efficacy, are, suspected, backup, contraception, is, recommended, in, cases, where, antibiotics, have, been, suggested, to, affect, the, efficiency, of, birth, control, pills, such, as, for, the, broad, spectrum, antibiotic, rifampicin, these, cases, may, be, due, to, an, increase, in, the, activities, of, hepatic, liver, enzymes, causing, increased, breakdown, of, the, pill, s, active, ingredients, effects, on, the, intestinal, flora, which, might, result, in, reduced, absorption, of, estrogens, in, the, colon, have, also, been, suggested, but, such, suggestions, have, been, inconclusive, and, controversial, clinicians, have, recommended, that, extra, contraceptive, measures, be, applied, during, therapies, using, antibiotics, that, are, suspected, to, interact, with, oral, contraceptives, more, studies, on, the, possible, interactions, between, antibiotics, and, birth, control, pills, oral, contraceptives, are, required, as, well, as, careful, assessment, of, patient, specific, risk, factors, for, potential, oral, contractive, pill, failure, prior, to, dismissing, the, need, for, backup, contraception, interactions, between, alcohol, and, certain, antibiotics, may, occur, and, may, cause, side, effects, and, decreased, effectiveness, of, antibiotic, therapy, while, moderate, alcohol, consumption, is, unlikely, to, interfere, with, many, common, antibiotics, there, are, specific, types, of, antibiotics, with, which, alcohol, consumption, may, cause, serious, side, effects, therefore, potential, risks, of, side, effects, and, effectiveness, depend, on, the, type, of, antibiotic, administered, antibiotics, such, as, metronidazole, tinidazole, cephamandole, latamoxef, cefoperazone, cefmenoxime, and, furazolidone, cause, a, disulfiram, like, chemical, reaction, with, alcohol, by, inhibiting, its, breakdown, by, acetaldehyde, dehydrogenase, which, may, result, in, vomiting, nausea, and, shortness, of, breath, in, addition, the, efficacy, of, doxycycline, and, erythromycin, succinate, may, be, reduced, by, alcohol, consumption, other, effects, of, alcohol, on, antibiotic, activity, include, altered, activity, of, the, liver, enzymes, that, break, down, the, antibiotic, compound, the, successful, outcome, of, antimicrobial, therapy, with, antibacterial, compounds, depends, on, several, factors, these, include, host, defense, mechanisms, the, location, of, infection, and, the, pharmacokinetic, and, pharmacodynamic, properties, of, the, antibacterial, the, bactericidal, activity, of, antibacterials, may, depend, on, the, bacterial, growth, phase, and, it, often, requires, ongoing, metabolic, activity, and, division, of, bacterial, cells, these, findings, are, based, on, laboratory, studies, and, in, clinical, settings, have, also, been, shown, to, eliminate, bacterial, infection, since, the, activity, of, antibacterials, depends, frequently, on, its, concentration, in, vitro, characterization, of, antibacterial, activity, commonly, includes, the, determination, of, the, minimum, inhibitory, concentration, and, minimum, bactericidal, concentration, of, an, antibacterial, to, predict, clinical, outcome, the, antimicrobial, activity, of, an, antibacterial, is, usually, combined, with, its, pharmacokinetic, profile, and, several, pharmacological, parameters, are, used, as, markers, of, drug, efficacy, in, important, infectious, diseases, including, tuberculosis, combination, therapy, i, e, the, concurrent, application, of, two, or, more, antibiotics, has, been, used, to, delay, or, prevent, the, emergence, of, resistance, in, acute, bacterial, infections, antibiotics, as, part, of, combination, therapy, are, prescribed, for, their, synergistic, effects, to, improve, treatment, outcome, as, the, combined, effect, of, both, antibiotics, is, better, than, their, individual, effect, fosfomycin, has, the, highest, number, of, synergistic, combinations, among, antibiotics, and, is, almost, always, used, as, a, partner, drug, methicillin, resistant, staphylococcus, aureus, infections, may, be, treated, with, a, combination, therapy, of, fusidic, acid, and, rifampicin, antibiotics, used, in, combination, may, also, be, antagonistic, and, the, combined, effects, of, the, two, antibiotics, may, be, less, than, if, one, of, the, antibiotics, was, given, as, a, monotherapy, for, example, chloramphenicol, and, tetracyclines, are, antagonists, to, penicillins, however, this, can, vary, depending, on, the, species, of, bacteria, in, general, combinations, of, a, bacteriostatic, antibiotic, and, bactericidal, antibiotic, are, antagonistic, in, addition, to, combining, one, antibiotic, with, another, antibiotics, are, sometimes, co, administered, with, resistance, modifying, agents, for, example, lactam, antibiotics, may, be, used, in, combination, with, lactamase, inhibitors, such, as, clavulanic, acid, or, sulbactam, when, a, patient, is, infected, with, a, lactamase, producing, strain, of, bacteria, antibiotics, are, commonly, classified, based, on, their, mechanism, of, action, chemical, structure, or, spectrum, of, activity, most, target, bacterial, functions, or, growth, processes, those, that, target, the, bacterial, cell, wall, penicillins, and, cephalosporins, or, the, cell, membrane, polymyxins, or, interfere, with, essential, bacterial, enzymes, rifamycins, lipiarmycins, quinolones, and, sulfonamides, have, bactericidal, activities, killing, the, bacteria, protein, synthesis, inhibitors, macrolides, lincosamides, and, tetracyclines, are, usually, bacteriostatic, inhibiting, further, growth, with, the, exception, of, bactericidal, aminoglycosides, further, categorization, is, based, on, their, target, specificity, narrow, spectrum, antibiotics, target, specific, types, of, bacteria, such, as, gram, negative, or, gram, positive, whereas, broad, spectrum, antibiotics, affect, a, wide, range, of, bacteria, following, a, 40, year, break, in, discovering, classes, of, antibacterial, compounds, four, new, classes, of, antibiotics, were, introduced, to, clinical, use, in, the, late, 2000s, and, early, 2010s, cyclic, lipopeptides, such, as, daptomycin, glycylcyclines, such, as, tigecycline, oxazolidinones, such, as, linezolid, and, lipiarmycins, such, as, fidaxomicin, with, advances, in, medicinal, chemistry, most, modern, antibacterials, are, semisynthetic, modifications, of, various, natural, compounds, these, include, for, example, the, beta, lactam, antibiotics, which, include, the, penicillins, produced, by, fungi, in, the, genus, penicillium, the, cephalosporins, and, the, carbapenems, compounds, that, are, still, isolated, from, living, organisms, are, the, aminoglycosides, whereas, other, antibacterials, for, example, the, sulfonamides, the, quinolones, and, the, oxazolidinones, are, produced, solely, by, chemical, synthesis, many, antibacterial, compounds, are, relatively, small, molecules, with, a, molecular, weight, of, less, than, 1000, daltons, since, the, first, pioneering, efforts, of, howard, florey, and, chain, in, 1939, the, importance, of, antibiotics, including, antibacterials, to, medicine, has, led, to, intense, research, into, producing, antibacterials, at, large, scales, following, screening, of, antibacterials, against, a, wide, range, of, bacteria, production, of, the, active, compounds, is, carried, out, using, fermentation, usually, in, strongly, aerobic, conditions, the, emergence, of, antibiotic, resistant, bacteria, is, a, common, phenomenon, mainly, caused, by, the, overuse, misuse, it, represents, a, threat, to, health, globally, emergence, of, resistance, often, reflects, evolutionary, processes, that, take, place, during, antibiotic, therapy, the, antibiotic, treatment, may, select, for, bacterial, strains, with, physiologically, or, genetically, enhanced, capacity, to, survive, high, doses, of, antibiotics, under, certain, conditions, it, may, result, in, preferential, growth, of, resistant, bacteria, while, growth, of, susceptible, bacteria, is, inhibited, by, the, drug, for, example, antibacterial, selection, for, strains, having, previously, acquired, antibacterial, resistance, genes, was, demonstrated, in, 1943, by, the, luria, delbr, ck, experiment, antibiotics, such, as, penicillin, and, erythromycin, which, used, to, have, a, high, efficacy, against, many, bacterial, species, and, strains, have, become, less, effective, due, to, the, increased, resistance, of, many, bacterial, strains, resistance, may, take, the, form, of, biodegradation, of, pharmaceuticals, such, as, sulfamethazine, degrading, soil, bacteria, introduced, to, sulfamethazine, through, medicated, pig, feces, the, survival, of, bacteria, often, results, from, an, inheritable, resistance, but, the, growth, of, resistance, to, antibacterials, also, occurs, through, horizontal, gene, transfer, horizontal, transfer, is, more, likely, to, happen, in, locations, of, frequent, antibiotic, use, antibacterial, resistance, may, impose, a, biological, cost, thereby, reducing, fitness, of, resistant, strains, which, can, limit, the, spread, of, antibacterial, resistant, bacteria, for, example, in, the, absence, of, antibacterial, compounds, additional, mutations, however, may, compensate, for, this, fitness, cost, and, can, aid, the, survival, of, these, bacteria, paleontological, data, show, that, both, antibiotics, and, antibiotic, resistance, are, ancient, compounds, and, mechanisms, useful, antibiotic, targets, are, those, for, which, mutations, negatively, impact, bacterial, reproduction, or, viability, several, molecular, mechanisms, of, antibacterial, resistance, exist, intrinsic, antibacterial, resistance, may, be, part, of, the, genetic, makeup, of, bacterial, strains, for, example, an, antibiotic, target, may, be, absent, from, the, bacterial, genome, acquired, resistance, results, from, a, mutation, in, the, bacterial, chromosome, or, the, acquisition, of, extra, chromosomal, dna, antibacterial, producing, bacteria, have, evolved, resistance, mechanisms, that, have, been, shown, to, be, similar, to, and, may, have, been, transferred, to, antibacterial, resistant, strains, the, spread, of, antibacterial, resistance, often, occurs, through, vertical, transmission, of, mutations, during, growth, and, by, genetic, recombination, of, dna, by, horizontal, genetic, exchange, for, instance, antibacterial, resistance, genes, can, be, exchanged, between, different, bacterial, strains, or, species, via, plasmids, that, carry, these, resistance, genes, plasmids, that, carry, several, different, resistance, genes, can, confer, resistance, to, multiple, antibacterials, cross, resistance, to, several, antibacterials, may, also, occur, when, a, resistance, mechanism, encoded, by, a, single, gene, conveys, resistance, to, more, than, one, antibacterial, compound, antibacterial, resistant, strains, and, species, sometimes, referred, to, as, superbugs, now, contribute, to, the, emergence, of, diseases, that, were, for, a, while, well, controlled, for, example, emergent, bacterial, strains, causing, tuberculosis, that, are, resistant, to, previously, effective, antibacterial, treatments, pose, many, therapeutic, challenges, every, year, nearly, half, a, million, new, cases, of, multidrug, resistant, tuberculosis, mdr, tb, are, estimated, to, occur, worldwide, for, example, ndm, 1, is, a, newly, identified, enzyme, conveying, bacterial, resistance, to, a, broad, range, of, beta, lactam, antibacterials, the, united, kingdom, s, health, protection, agency, has, stated, that, most, isolates, with, ndm, 1, enzyme, are, resistant, to, all, standard, intravenous, antibiotics, for, treatment, of, severe, infections, on, 26, may, 2016, an, e, coli, superbug, was, identified, in, the, united, states, resistant, to, colistin, the, last, line, of, defence, antibiotic, in, recent, years, even, anaerobic, bacteria, historically, considered, less, concerning, in, terms, of, resistance, have, demonstrated, high, rates, of, antibiotic, resistance, particularly, bacteroides, for, which, resistance, rates, to, penicillin, have, been, reported, to, exceed, 90, per, the, icu, book, the, first, rule, of, antibiotics, is, to, try, not, to, use, them, and, the, second, rule, is, try, not, to, use, too, many, of, them, inappropriate, antibiotic, treatment, and, overuse, of, antibiotics, have, contributed, to, the, emergence, of, antibiotic, resistant, bacteria, however, potential, harm, from, antibiotics, extends, beyond, selection, of, antimicrobial, resistance, and, their, overuse, is, associated, with, adverse, effects, for, patients, themselves, seen, most, clearly, in, critically, ill, patients, in, intensive, care, units, self, prescribing, of, antibiotics, is, an, example, of, misuse, many, antibiotics, are, frequently, prescribed, to, treat, symptoms, or, diseases, that, do, not, respond, to, antibiotics, or, that, are, likely, to, resolve, without, treatment, also, incorrect, or, suboptimal, antibiotics, are, prescribed, for, certain, bacterial, infections, the, overuse, of, antibiotics, like, penicillin, and, erythromycin, has, been, associated, with, emerging, antibiotic, resistance, since, the, 1950s, widespread, usage, of, antibiotics, in, hospitals, has, also, been, associated, with, increases, in, bacterial, strains, and, species, that, no, longer, respond, to, treatment, with, the, most, common, antibiotics, common, forms, of, antibiotic, misuse, include, excessive, use, of, prophylactic, antibiotics, in, travelers, and, failure, of, medical, professionals, to, prescribe, the, correct, dosage, of, antibiotics, on, the, basis, of, the, patient, s, weight, and, history, of, prior, use, other, forms, of, misuse, include, failure, to, take, the, entire, prescribed, course, of, the, antibiotic, incorrect, dosage, and, administration, or, failure, to, rest, for, sufficient, recovery, inappropriate, antibiotic, treatment, for, example, is, their, prescription, to, treat, viral, infections, such, as, the, common, cold, one, study, on, respiratory, tract, infections, found, physicians, were, more, likely, to, prescribe, antibiotics, to, patients, who, appeared, to, expect, them, multifactorial, interventions, aimed, at, both, physicians, and, patients, can, reduce, inappropriate, prescription, of, antibiotics, the, lack, of, rapid, point, of, care, diagnostic, tests, particularly, in, resource, limited, settings, is, considered, one, of, the, drivers, of, antibiotic, misuse, several, organizations, concerned, with, antimicrobial, resistance, are, lobbying, to, eliminate, the, unnecessary, use, of, antibiotics, the, issues, of, misuse, and, overuse, of, antibiotics, have, been, addressed, by, the, formation, of, the, us, interagency, task, force, on, antimicrobial, resistance, this, task, force, aims, to, actively, address, antimicrobial, resistance, and, is, coordinated, by, the, us, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, and, the, national, institutes, of, health, as, well, as, other, us, agencies, a, non, governmental, organization, campaign, group, is, keep, antibiotics, working, in, france, an, antibiotics, are, not, automatic, government, campaign, started, in, 2002, and, led, to, a, marked, reduction, of, unnecessary, antibiotic, prescriptions, especially, in, children, the, emergence, of, antibiotic, resistance, has, prompted, restrictions, on, their, use, in, the, uk, in, 1970, swann, report, 1969, and, the, european, union, has, banned, the, use, of, antibiotics, as, growth, promotional, agents, since, 2003, moreover, several, organizations, including, the, world, health, organization, the, national, academy, of, sciences, and, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, have, advocated, restricting, the, amount, of, antibiotic, use, in, food, animal, production, however, commonly, there, are, delays, in, regulatory, and, legislative, actions, to, limit, the, use, of, antibiotics, attributable, partly, to, resistance, against, such, regulation, by, industries, using, or, selling, antibiotics, and, to, the, time, required, for, research, to, test, causal, links, between, their, use, and, resistance, to, them, two, federal, bills, s, 742, and, h, r, 2562, aimed, at, phasing, out, nontherapeutic, use, of, antibiotics, in, us, food, animals, were, proposed, but, have, not, passed, these, bills, were, endorsed, by, public, health, and, medical, organizations, including, the, american, holistic, nurses, association, the, american, medical, association, and, the, american, public, health, association, despite, pledges, by, food, companies, and, restaurants, to, reduce, or, eliminate, meat, that, comes, from, animals, treated, with, antibiotics, the, purchase, of, antibiotics, for, use, on, farm, animals, has, been, increasing, every, year, there, has, been, extensive, use, of, antibiotics, in, animal, husbandry, in, the, united, states, the, question, of, emergence, of, antibiotic, resistant, bacterial, strains, due, to, use, of, antibiotics, in, livestock, was, raised, by, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, in, 1977, in, march, 2012, the, united, states, district, court, for, the, southern, district, of, new, york, ruling, in, an, action, brought, by, the, natural, resources, defense, council, and, others, ordered, the, fda, to, revoke, approvals, for, the, use, of, antibiotics, in, livestock, which, violated, fda, regulations, studies, have, shown, that, common, misconceptions, about, the, effectiveness, and, necessity, of, antibiotics, to, treat, common, mild, illnesses, contribute, to, their, overuse, other, forms, of, antibiotic, associated, harm, include, anaphylaxis, drug, toxicity, most, notably, kidney, and, liver, damage, and, super, infections, with, resistant, organisms, antibiotics, are, also, known, to, affect, mitochondrial, function, and, this, may, contribute, to, the, bioenergetic, failure, of, immune, cells, seen, in, sepsis, they, also, alter, the, microbiome, of, the, gut, lungs, and, skin, which, may, be, associated, with, adverse, effects, such, as, clostridium, difficile, associated, diarrhoea, whilst, antibiotics, can, clearly, be, lifesaving, in, patients, with, bacterial, infections, their, overuse, especially, in, patients, where, infections, are, hard, to, diagnose, can, lead, to, harm, via, multiple, mechanisms, before, the, early, 20th, century, treatments, for, infections, were, based, primarily, on, medicinal, folklore, mixtures, with, antimicrobial, properties, that, were, used, in, treatments, of, infections, were, described, over, 2, 000, years, ago, many, ancient, cultures, including, the, ancient, egyptians, and, ancient, greeks, used, specially, selected, mold, and, plant, materials, to, treat, infections, nubian, mummies, studied, in, the, 1990s, were, found, to, contain, significant, levels, of, tetracycline, the, beer, brewed, at, that, time, was, conjectured, to, have, been, the, source, the, use, of, antibiotics, in, modern, medicine, began, with, the, discovery, of, synthetic, antibiotics, derived, from, dyes, various, essential, oils, have, been, shown, to, have, anti, microbial, properties, along, with, this, the, plants, from, which, these, oils, have, been, derived, from, can, be, used, as, niche, anti, microbial, agents, synthetic, antibiotic, chemotherapy, as, a, science, and, development, of, antibacterials, began, in, germany, with, paul, ehrlich, in, the, late, 1880s, ehrlich, noted, certain, dyes, would, colour, human, animal, or, bacterial, cells, whereas, others, did, not, he, then, proposed, the, idea, that, it, might, be, possible, to, create, chemicals, that, would, act, as, a, selective, drug, that, would, bind, to, and, kill, bacteria, without, harming, the, human, host, after, screening, hundreds, of, dyes, against, various, organisms, in, 1907, he, discovered, a, medicinally, useful, drug, the, first, synthetic, antibacterial, organoarsenic, compound, salvarsan, now, called, arsphenamine, this, heralded, the, era, of, antibacterial, treatment, that, was, begun, with, the, discovery, of, a, series, of, arsenic, derived, synthetic, antibiotics, by, both, alfred, bertheim, and, ehrlich, in, 1907, ehrlich, and, bertheim, had, experimented, with, various, chemicals, derived, from, dyes, to, treat, trypanosomiasis, in, mice, and, spirochaeta, infection, in, rabbits, while, their, early, compounds, were, too, toxic, ehrlich, and, sahachiro, hata, a, japanese, bacteriologist, working, with, ehrlich, in, the, quest, for, a, drug, to, treat, syphilis, achieved, success, with, the, 606th, compound, in, their, series, of, experiments, in, 1910, ehrlich, and, hata, announced, their, discovery, which, they, called, drug, 606, at, the, congress, for, internal, medicine, at, wiesbaden, the, hoechst, company, began, to, market, the, compound, toward, the, end, of, 1910, under, the, name, salvarsan, now, known, as, arsphenamine, the, drug, was, used, to, treat, syphilis, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, in, 1908, ehrlich, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, his, contributions, to, immunology, hata, was, nominated, for, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1911, and, for, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1912, and, 1913, the, first, sulfonamide, and, the, first, systemically, active, antibacterial, drug, prontosil, was, developed, by, a, research, team, led, by, gerhard, domagk, in, 1932, or, 1933, at, the, bayer, laboratories, of, the, ig, farben, conglomerate, in, germany, for, which, domagk, received, the, 1939, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, sulfanilamide, the, active, drug, of, prontosil, was, not, patentable, as, it, had, already, been, in, use, in, the, dye, industry, for, some, years, prontosil, had, a, relatively, broad, effect, against, gram, positive, cocci, but, not, against, enterobacteria, research, was, stimulated, apace, by, its, success, the, discovery, and, development, of, this, sulfonamide, drug, opened, the, era, of, antibacterials, observations, about, the, growth, of, some, microorganisms, inhibiting, the, growth, of, other, microorganisms, have, been, reported, since, the, late, 19th, century, these, observations, of, antibiosis, between, microorganisms, led, to, the, discovery, of, natural, antibacterials, louis, pasteur, observed, if, we, could, intervene, in, the, antagonism, observed, between, some, bacteria, it, would, offer, perhaps, the, greatest, hopes, for, therapeutics, in, 1874, physician, sir, william, roberts, noted, that, cultures, of, the, mould, penicillium, glaucum, that, is, used, in, the, making, of, some, types, of, blue, cheese, did, not, display, bacterial, contamination, in, 1895, vincenzo, tiberio, italian, physician, published, a, paper, on, the, antibacterial, power, of, some, extracts, of, mold, in, 1897, doctoral, student, ernest, duchesne, submitted, a, dissertation, contribution, l, tude, de, la, concurrence, vitale, chez, les, micro, organismes, antagonisme, entre, les, moisissures, et, les, microbes, contribution, to, the, study, of, vital, competition, in, micro, organisms, antagonism, between, moulds, and, microbes, the, first, known, scholarly, work, to, consider, the, therapeutic, capabilities, of, moulds, resulting, from, their, anti, microbial, activity, in, his, thesis, duchesne, proposed, that, bacteria, and, moulds, engage, in, a, perpetual, battle, for, survival, duchesne, observed, that, e, coli, was, eliminated, by, penicillium, glaucum, when, they, were, both, grown, in, the, same, culture, he, also, observed, that, when, he, inoculated, laboratory, animals, with, lethal, doses, of, typhoid, bacilli, together, with, penicillium, glaucum, the, animals, did, not, contract, typhoid, duchesne, s, army, service, after, getting, his, degree, prevented, him, from, doing, any, further, research, duchesne, died, of, tuberculosis, a, disease, now, treated, by, antibiotics, in, 1928, sir, alexander, fleming, postulated, the, existence, of, penicillin, a, molecule, produced, by, certain, moulds, that, kills, or, stops, the, growth, of, certain, kinds, of, bacteria, fleming, was, working, on, a, culture, of, disease, causing, bacteria, when, he, noticed, the, spores, of, a, green, mold, penicillium, rubens, in, one, of, his, culture, plates, he, observed, that, the, presence, of, the, mould, killed, or, prevented, the, growth, of, the, bacteria, fleming, postulated, that, the, mould, must, secrete, an, antibacterial, substance, which, he, named, penicillin, in, 1928, fleming, believed, that, its, antibacterial, properties, could, be, exploited, for, chemotherapy, he, initially, characterised, some, of, its, biological, properties, and, attempted, to, use, a, crude, preparation, to, treat, some, infections, but, he, was, unable, to, pursue, its, further, development, without, the, aid, of, trained, chemists, ernst, chain, howard, florey, and, edward, abraham, succeeded, in, purifying, the, first, penicillin, penicillin, g, in, 1942, but, it, did, not, become, widely, available, outside, the, allied, military, before, 1945, later, norman, heatley, developed, the, back, extraction, technique, for, efficiently, purifying, penicillin, in, bulk, the, chemical, structure, of, penicillin, was, first, proposed, by, abraham, in, 1942, and, then, later, confirmed, by, dorothy, crowfoot, hodgkin, in, 1945, purified, penicillin, displayed, potent, antibacterial, activity, against, a, wide, range, of, bacteria, and, had, low, toxicity, in, humans, furthermore, its, activity, was, not, inhibited, by, biological, constituents, such, as, pus, unlike, the, synthetic, sulfonamides, see, below, the, development, of, penicillin, led, to, renewed, interest, in, the, search, for, antibiotic, compounds, with, similar, efficacy, and, safety, for, their, successful, development, of, penicillin, which, fleming, had, accidentally, discovered, but, could, not, develop, himself, as, a, therapeutic, drug, chain, and, florey, shared, the, 1945, nobel, prize, in, medicine, with, fleming, florey, credited, ren, dubos, with, pioneering, the, approach, of, deliberately, and, systematically, searching, for, antibacterial, compounds, which, had, led, to, the, discovery, of, gramicidin, and, had, revived, florey, s, research, in, penicillin, in, 1939, coinciding, with, the, start, of, world, war, ii, dubos, had, reported, the, discovery, of, the, first, naturally, derived, antibiotic, tyrothricin, a, compound, of, 20, gramicidin, and, 80, tyrocidine, from, bacillus, brevis, it, was, one, of, the, first, commercially, manufactured, antibiotics, and, was, very, effective, in, treating, wounds, and, ulcers, during, world, war, ii, gramicidin, however, could, not, be, used, systemically, because, of, toxicity, tyrocidine, also, proved, too, toxic, for, systemic, usage, research, results, obtained, during, that, period, were, not, shared, between, the, axis, and, the, allied, powers, during, world, war, ii, and, limited, access, during, the, cold, war, during, the, mid, 20th, century, the, number, of, new, antibiotic, substances, introduced, for, medical, use, increased, significantly, from, 1935, to, 1968, 12, new, classes, were, launched, however, after, this, the, number, of, new, classes, dropped, markedly, with, only, two, new, classes, introduced, between, 1969, and, 2003, both, the, who, and, the, infectious, disease, society, of, america, report, that, the, weak, antibiotic, pipeline, does, not, match, bacteria, s, increasing, ability, to, develop, resistance, the, infectious, disease, society, of, america, report, noted, that, the, number, of, new, antibiotics, approved, for, marketing, per, year, had, been, declining, and, identified, seven, antibiotics, against, the, gram, negative, bacilli, currently, in, phase, 2, or, phase, 3, clinical, trials, however, these, drugs, did, not, address, the, entire, spectrum, of, resistance, of, gram, negative, bacilli, according, to, the, who, fifty, one, new, therapeutic, entities, antibiotics, including, combinations, are, in, phase, 1, 3, clinical, trials, as, of, may, 2017, antibiotics, targeting, multidrug, resistant, gram, positive, pathogens, remains, a, high, priority, a, few, antibiotics, have, received, marketing, authorization, in, the, last, seven, years, the, cephalosporin, ceftaroline, and, the, lipoglycopeptides, oritavancin, and, telavancin, have, been, approved, for, the, treatment, of, acute, bacterial, skin, and, skin, structure, infection, and, community, acquired, bacterial, pneumonia, the, lipoglycopeptide, dalbavancin, and, the, oxazolidinone, tedizolid, has, also, been, approved, for, use, for, the, treatment, of, acute, bacterial, skin, and, skin, structure, infection, the, first, in, a, new, class, of, narrow, spectrum, macrocyclic, antibiotics, fidaxomicin, has, been, approved, for, the, treatment, of, c, difficile, colitis, new, cephalosporin, lactamase, inhibitor, combinations, also, approved, include, ceftazidime, avibactam, and, ceftolozane, avibactam, for, complicated, urinary, tract, infection, and, intra, abdominal, infection, possible, improvements, include, clarification, of, clinical, trial, regulations, by, fda, furthermore, appropriate, economic, incentives, could, persuade, pharmaceutical, companies, to, invest, in, this, endeavor, in, the, us, the, antibiotic, development, to, advance, patient, treatment, adapt, act, was, introduced, with, the, aim, of, fast, tracking, the, drug, development, of, antibiotics, to, combat, the, growing, threat, of, superbugs, under, this, act, fda, can, approve, antibiotics, and, antifungals, treating, life, threatening, infections, based, on, smaller, clinical, trials, the, cdc, will, monitor, the, use, of, antibiotics, and, the, emerging, resistance, and, publish, the, data, the, fda, antibiotics, labeling, process, susceptibility, test, interpretive, criteria, for, microbial, organisms, or, breakpoints, will, provide, accurate, data, to, healthcare, professionals, according, to, allan, coukell, senior, director, for, health, programs, at, the, pew, charitable, trusts, by, allowing, drug, developers, to, rely, on, smaller, datasets, and, clarifying, fda, s, authority, to, tolerate, a, higher, level, of, uncertainty, for, these, drugs, when, making, a, risk, benefit, calculation, adapt, would, make, the, clinical, trials, more, feasible, because, antibiotic, resistant, bacterial, strains, continue, to, emerge, and, spread, there, is, a, constant, need, to, develop, new, antibacterial, treatments, current, strategies, include, traditional, chemistry, based, approaches, such, as, natural, product, based, drug, discovery, newer, chemistry, based, approaches, such, as, drug, design, traditional, biology, based, approaches, such, as, immunoglobulin, therapy, and, experimental, biology, based, approaches, such, as, phage, therapy, fecal, microbiota, transplants, antisense, rna, based, treatments, and, crispr, cas9, based, treatments, most, of, the, antibiotics, in, current, use, are, natural, products, or, natural, product, derivatives, and, bacterial, fungal, plant, and, animal, extracts, are, being, screened, in, the, search, for, new, antibiotics, organisms, may, be, selected, for, testing, based, on, ecological, ethnomedical, genomic, or, historical, rationales, medicinal, plants, for, example, are, screened, on, the, basis, that, they, are, used, by, traditional, healers, to, prevent, or, cure, infection, and, may, therefore, contain, antibacterial, compounds, also, soil, bacteria, are, screened, on, the, basis, that, historically, they, have, been, a, very, rich, source, of, antibiotics, with, 70, to, 80, of, antibiotics, in, current, use, derived, from, the, actinomycetes, in, addition, to, screening, natural, products, for, direct, antibacterial, activity, they, are, sometimes, screened, for, the, ability, to, suppress, antibiotic, resistance, and, antibiotic, tolerance, for, example, some, secondary, metabolites, inhibit, drug, efflux, pumps, thereby, increasing, the, concentration, of, antibiotic, able, to, reach, its, cellular, target, and, decreasing, bacterial, resistance, to, the, antibiotic, natural, products, known, to, inhibit, bacterial, efflux, pumps, include, the, alkaloid, lysergol, the, carotenoids, capsanthin, and, capsorubin, and, the, flavonoids, rotenone, and, chrysin, other, natural, products, this, time, primary, metabolites, rather, than, secondary, metabolites, have, been, shown, to, eradicate, antibiotic, tolerance, for, example, glucose, mannitol, and, fructose, reduce, antibiotic, tolerance, in, escherichia, coli, and, staphylococcus, aureus, rendering, them, more, susceptible, to, killing, by, aminoglycoside, antibiotics, natural, products, may, be, screened, for, the, ability, to, suppress, bacterial, virulence, factors, too, virulence, factors, are, molecules, cellular, structures, and, regulatory, systems, that, enable, bacteria, to, evade, the, body, s, immune, defenses, e, g, urease, staphyloxanthin, move, towards, attach, to, and, or, invade, human, cells, e, g, type, iv, pili, adhesins, internalins, coordinate, the, activation, of, virulence, genes, e, g, quorum, sensing, and, cause, disease, e, g, exotoxins, examples, of, natural, products, with, antivirulence, activity, include, the, flavonoid, epigallocatechin, gallate, which, inhibits, listeriolysin, o, the, quinone, tetrangomycin, which, inhibits, staphyloxanthin, and, the, sesquiterpene, zerumbone, which, inhibits, acinetobacter, baumannii, motility, antibodies, anti, tetanus, immunoglobulin, have, been, used, in, the, treatment, and, prevention, of, tetanus, since, the, 1910s, and, this, approach, continues, to, be, a, useful, way, of, controlling, bacterial, diseases, the, monoclonal, antibody, bezlotoxumab, for, example, has, been, approved, by, the, us, fda, and, ema, for, recurrent, clostridium, difficile, infection, and, other, monoclonal, antibodies, are, in, development, e, g, ar, 301, for, the, adjunctive, treatment, of, s, aureus, ventilator, associated, pneumonia, antibody, treatments, act, by, binding, to, and, neutralizing, bacterial, exotoxins, and, other, virulence, factors, phage, therapy, is, under, investigation, as, a, method, of, treating, antibiotic, resistant, strains, of, bacteria, phage, therapy, involves, infecting, bacterial, pathogens, with, viruses, bacteriophages, and, their, host, ranges, are, extremely, specific, for, certain, bacteria, thus, unlike, antibiotics, they, do, not, disturb, the, host, organism, s, intestinal, microbiota, bacteriophages, also, known, as, phages, infect, and, kill, bacteria, primarily, during, lytic, cycles, phages, insert, their, dna, into, the, bacterium, where, it, is, transcribed, and, used, to, make, new, phages, after, which, the, cell, will, lyse, releasing, new, phage, that, are, able, to, infect, and, destroy, further, bacteria, of, the, same, strain, the, high, specificity, of, phage, protects, good, bacteria, from, destruction, some, disadvantages, to, the, use, of, bacteriophages, also, exist, however, bacteriophages, may, harbour, virulence, factors, or, toxic, genes, in, their, genomes, and, prior, to, use, it, may, be, prudent, to, identify, genes, with, similarity, to, known, virulence, factors, or, toxins, by, genomic, sequencing, in, addition, the, oral, and, iv, administration, of, phages, for, the, eradication, of, bacterial, infections, poses, a, much, higher, safety, risk, than, topical, application, also, there, is, the, additional, concern, of, uncertain, immune, responses, to, these, large, antigenic, cocktails, there, are, considerable, regulatory, hurdles, that, must, be, cleared, for, such, therapies, despite, numerous, challenges, the, use, of, bacteriophages, as, a, replacement, for, antimicrobial, agents, against, mdr, pathogens, that, no, longer, respond, to, conventional, antibiotics, remains, an, attractive, option, fecal, microbiota, transplants, involve, transferring, the, full, intestinal, microbiota, from, a, healthy, human, donor, in, the, form, of, stool, to, patients, with, c, difficile, infection, although, this, procedure, has, not, been, officially, approved, by, the, us, fda, its, use, is, permitted, under, some, conditions, in, patients, with, antibiotic, resistant, c, difficile, infection, cure, rates, are, around, 90, and, work, is, underway, to, develop, stool, banks, standardized, products, and, methods, of, oral, delivery, fecal, microbiota, transplantation, has, also, been, used, more, recently, for, inflammatory, bowel, diseases, antisense, rna, based, treatment, also, known, as, gene, silencing, therapy, involves, a, identifying, bacterial, genes, that, encode, essential, proteins, e, g, the, pseudomonas, aeruginosa, genes, acpp, lpxc, and, rpsj, b, synthesizing, single, stranded, rna, that, is, complementary, to, the, mrna, encoding, these, essential, proteins, and, c, delivering, the, single, stranded, rna, to, the, infection, site, using, cell, penetrating, peptides, or, liposomes, the, antisense, rna, then, hybridizes, with, the, bacterial, mrna, and, blocks, its, translation, into, the, essential, protein, antisense, rna, based, treatment, has, been, shown, to, be, effective, in, in, vivo, models, of, p, aeruginosa, pneumonia, in, addition, to, silencing, essential, bacterial, genes, antisense, rna, can, be, used, to, silence, bacterial, genes, responsible, for, antibiotic, resistance, for, example, antisense, rna, has, been, developed, that, silences, the, s, aureus, meca, gene, the, gene, that, encodes, modified, penicillin, binding, protein, 2a, and, renders, s, aureus, strains, methicillin, resistant, antisense, rna, targeting, meca, mrna, has, been, shown, to, restore, the, susceptibility, of, methicillin, resistant, staphylococci, to, oxacillin, in, both, in, vitro, and, in, vivo, studies, in, the, early, 2000s, a, system, was, discovered, that, enables, bacteria, to, defend, themselves, against, invading, viruses, the, system, known, as, crispr, cas9, consists, of, a, an, enzyme, that, destroys, dna, the, nuclease, cas9, and, b, the, dna, sequences, of, previously, encountered, viral, invaders, crispr, these, viral, dna, sequences, enable, the, nuclease, to, target, foreign, viral, rather, than, self, bacterial, dna, although, the, function, of, crispr, cas9, in, nature, is, to, protect, bacteria, the, dna, sequences, in, the, crispr, component, of, the, system, can, be, modified, so, that, the, cas9, nuclease, targets, bacterial, resistance, genes, or, bacterial, virulence, genes, instead, of, viral, genes, the, modified, crispr, cas9, system, can, then, be, administered, to, bacterial, pathogens, using, plasmids, or, bacteriophages, this, approach, has, successfully, been, used, to, silence, antibiotic, resistance, and, reduce, the, virulence, of, enterohemorrhagic, e, coli, in, an, in, vivo, model, of, infection, in, addition, to, developing, new, antibacterial, treatments, it, is, important, to, reduce, the, selection, pressure, for, the, emergence, and, spread, of, antibiotic, resistance, strategies, to, accomplish, this, include, well, established, infection, control, measures, such, as, infrastructure, improvement, e, g, less, crowded, housing, better, sanitation, e, g, safe, drinking, water, and, food, and, vaccine, development, other, approaches, such, as, antibiotic, stewardship, and, experimental, approaches, such, as, the, use, of, prebiotics, and, probiotics, to, prevent, infection, antibiotic, cycling, where, antibiotics, are, alternated, by, clinicians, to, treat, microbial, diseases, is, proposed, but, recent, studies, revealed, such, strategies, are, ineffective, against, antibiotic, resistance, vaccines, rely, on, immune, modulation, or, augmentation, vaccination, either, excites, or, reinforces, the, immune, competence, of, a, host, to, ward, off, infection, leading, to, the, activation, of, macrophages, the, production, of, antibodies, inflammation, and, other, classic, immune, reactions, antibacterial, vaccines, have, been, responsible, for, a, drastic, reduction, in, global, bacterial, diseases, vaccines, made, from, attenuated, whole, cells, or, lysates, have, been, replaced, largely, by, less, reactogenic, cell, free, vaccines, consisting, of, purified, components, including, capsular, polysaccharides, and, their, conjugates, to, protein, carriers, as, well, as, inactivated, toxins, toxoids, and, proteins
