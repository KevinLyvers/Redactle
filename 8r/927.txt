the, arecaceae, r, k, e, s, i, a, is, a, family, of, perennial, flowering, plants, in, the, monocot, order, arecales, their, growth, form, can, be, climbers, shrubs, tree, like, and, stemless, plants, all, commonly, known, as, palms, those, having, a, tree, like, form, are, called, palm, trees, currently, 181, genera, with, around, 2, 600, species, are, known, most, of, which, are, restricted, to, tropical, and, subtropical, climates, most, palms, are, distinguished, by, their, large, compound, evergreen, leaves, known, as, fronds, arranged, at, the, top, of, an, unbranched, stem, except, for, the, hyphaene, genus, who, has, branched, palms, however, palms, exhibit, an, enormous, diversity, in, physical, characteristics, and, inhabit, nearly, every, type, of, habitat, within, their, range, from, rainforests, to, deserts, palms, are, among, the, best, known, and, most, extensively, cultivated, plant, families, they, have, been, important, to, humans, throughout, much, of, history, especially, in, regions, like, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, a, wide, range, of, common, products, and, foods, are, derived, from, palms, in, contemporary, times, palms, are, also, widely, used, in, landscaping, in, many, historical, cultures, because, of, their, importance, as, food, palms, were, symbols, for, such, ideas, as, victory, peace, and, fertility, the, word, arecaceae, is, derived, from, the, word, areca, with, the, suffix, aceae, areca, is, derived, from, portuguese, via, malayalam, a, aykka, which, is, from, dravidian, a, ay, kk, y, areca, nut, the, suffix, aceae, is, the, feminine, plural, of, the, latin, ceus, resembling, palm, originates, from, latin, palma, semantically, overlapping, with, sense, of, hand, front, due, to, similar, splayed, shape, ultimately, from, proto, indo, european, pl, h, meh, a, direct, descendant, folm, once, existed, in, old, english, whether, as, shrubs, tree, like, or, vines, palms, have, two, methods, of, growth, solitary, or, clustered, the, common, representation, is, that, of, a, solitary, shoot, ending, in, a, crown, of, leaves, this, monopodial, character, may, be, exhibited, by, prostrate, trunkless, and, trunk, forming, members, some, common, palms, restricted, to, solitary, growth, include, washingtonia, and, roystonea, palms, may, instead, grow, in, sparse, though, dense, clusters, the, trunk, develops, an, axillary, bud, at, a, leaf, node, usually, near, the, base, from, which, a, new, shoot, emerges, the, new, shoot, in, turn, produces, an, axillary, bud, and, a, clustering, habit, results, exclusively, sympodial, genera, include, many, of, the, rattans, guihaia, and, rhapis, several, palm, genera, have, both, solitary, and, clustering, members, palms, which, are, usually, solitary, may, grow, in, clusters, and, vice, versa, palms, have, large, evergreen, leaves, that, are, either, palmately, fan, leaved, or, pinnately, feather, leaved, compound, and, spirally, arranged, at, the, top, of, the, stem, the, leaves, have, a, tubular, sheath, at, the, base, that, usually, splits, open, on, one, side, at, maturity, the, inflorescence, is, a, spadix, or, spike, surrounded, by, one, or, more, bracts, or, spathes, that, become, woody, at, maturity, the, flowers, are, generally, small, and, white, radially, symmetric, and, can, be, either, uni, or, bisexual, the, sepals, and, petals, usually, number, three, each, and, may, be, distinct, or, joined, at, the, base, the, stamens, generally, number, six, with, filaments, that, may, be, separate, attached, to, each, other, or, attached, to, the, pistil, at, the, base, the, fruit, is, usually, a, single, seeded, drupe, sometimes, berry, like, but, some, genera, e, g, salacca, may, contain, two, or, more, seeds, in, each, fruit, like, all, monocots, palms, do, not, have, the, ability, to, increase, the, width, of, a, stem, secondary, growth, via, the, same, kind, of, vascular, cambium, found, in, non, monocot, woody, plants, this, explains, the, cylindrical, shape, of, the, trunk, almost, constant, diameter, that, is, often, seen, in, palms, unlike, in, ring, forming, trees, however, many, palms, like, some, other, monocots, do, have, secondary, growth, although, because, it, does, not, arise, from, a, single, vascular, cambium, producing, xylem, inwards, and, phloem, outwards, it, is, often, called, anomalous, secondary, growth, the, arecaceae, are, notable, among, monocots, for, their, height, and, for, the, size, of, their, seeds, leaves, and, inflorescences, ceroxylon, quindiuense, colombia, s, national, tree, is, the, tallest, monocot, in, the, world, reaching, up, to, 60, metres, 197, ft, tall, the, coco, de, mer, lodoicea, maldivica, has, the, largest, seeds, of, any, plant, 40, 50, centimetres, 16, 20, in, in, diameter, and, weighing, 15, 30, kilograms, 33, 66, lb, each, coconuts, are, the, second, largest, raffia, palms, raphia, spp, have, the, largest, leaves, of, any, plant, up, to, 25, metres, 82, ft, long, and, 3, metres, 10, ft, wide, the, corypha, species, have, the, largest, inflorescence, of, any, plant, up, to, 7, 5, metres, 25, ft, tall, and, containing, millions, of, small, flowers, calamus, stems, can, reach, 200, metres, 656, ft, in, length, most, palms, are, native, to, tropical, and, subtropical, climates, palms, thrive, in, moist, and, hot, climates, but, can, be, found, in, a, variety, of, different, habitats, their, diversity, is, highest, in, wet, lowland, forests, south, america, the, caribbean, and, areas, of, the, south, pacific, and, southern, asia, are, regions, of, concentration, colombia, may, have, the, highest, number, of, palm, species, in, one, country, there, are, some, palms, that, are, also, native, to, desert, areas, such, as, the, arabian, peninsula, and, parts, of, northwestern, mexico, only, about, 130, palm, species, naturally, grow, entirely, beyond, the, tropics, mostly, in, humid, lowland, subtropical, climates, in, highlands, in, southern, asia, and, along, the, rim, lands, of, the, mediterranean, sea, the, northernmost, native, palm, is, chamaerops, humilis, which, reaches, 44, n, latitude, along, the, coast, of, liguria, italy, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, southernmost, palm, is, the, rhopalostylis, sapida, which, reaches, 44, s, on, the, chatham, islands, where, an, oceanic, climate, prevails, cultivation, of, palms, is, possible, north, of, subtropical, climates, and, some, higher, latitude, locales, such, as, ireland, scotland, england, and, the, pacific, northwest, feature, a, few, palms, in, protected, locations, and, microclimates, in, the, united, states, there, are, at, least, 12, native, palm, species, mostly, occurring, in, the, states, of, the, deep, south, and, florida, palms, inhabit, a, variety, of, ecosystems, more, than, two, thirds, of, palm, species, live, in, humid, moist, forests, where, some, species, grow, tall, enough, to, form, part, of, the, canopy, and, shorter, ones, form, part, of, the, understory, some, species, form, pure, stands, in, areas, with, poor, drainage, or, regular, flooding, including, raphia, hookeri, which, is, common, in, coastal, freshwater, swamps, in, west, africa, other, palms, live, in, tropical, mountain, habitats, above, 1, thousand, metres, 3, thousand, feet, such, as, those, in, the, genus, ceroxylon, native, to, the, andes, palms, may, also, live, in, grasslands, and, scrublands, usually, associated, with, a, water, source, and, in, desert, oases, such, as, the, date, palm, a, few, palms, are, adapted, to, extremely, basic, lime, soils, while, others, are, similarly, adapted, to, extreme, potassium, deficiency, and, toxicity, of, heavy, metals, in, serpentine, soils, palms, are, a, monophyletic, group, of, plants, meaning, the, group, consists, of, a, common, ancestor, and, all, its, descendants, extensive, taxonomic, research, on, palms, began, with, botanist, h, e, moore, who, organized, palms, into, 15, major, groups, based, mostly, on, general, morphological, characteristics, the, following, classification, proposed, by, n, w, uhl, and, j, dransfield, in, 1987, is, a, revision, of, moore, s, classification, that, organizes, palms, into, 6, subfamilies, a, few, general, traits, of, each, subfamily, are, listed, below, the, phytelephantoideae, is, the, sixth, subfamily, of, arecaceae, in, n, w, uhl, and, j, dransfield, s, 1987, classification, members, of, this, group, have, distinct, monopodial, flower, clusters, other, distinct, features, include, a, gynoecium, with, five, to, 10, joined, carpels, and, flowers, with, more, than, three, parts, per, whorl, fruits, are, multiple, seeded, and, have, multiple, parts, from, the, modern, phylogenomic, data, the, phytelephantoideae, are, tribe, in, the, ceroxyloideae, subfamily, currently, few, extensive, phylogenetic, studies, of, the, arecaceae, exist, in, 1997, baker, et, al, explored, subfamily, and, tribe, relationships, using, chloroplast, dna, from, 60, genera, from, all, subfamilies, and, tribes, the, results, strongly, showed, the, calamoideae, are, monophyletic, and, ceroxyloideae, and, coryphoideae, are, paraphyletic, the, relationships, of, arecoideae, are, uncertain, but, they, are, possibly, related, to, the, ceroxyloideae, and, phytelephantoideae, studies, have, suggested, the, lack, of, a, fully, resolved, hypothesis, for, the, relationships, within, the, family, is, due, to, a, variety, of, factors, including, difficulties, in, selecting, appropriate, outgroups, homoplasy, in, morphological, character, states, slow, rates, of, molecular, evolution, important, for, the, use, of, standard, dna, markers, and, character, polarization, however, hybridization, has, been, observed, among, orbignya, and, phoenix, species, and, using, chloroplast, dna, in, cladistic, studies, may, produce, inaccurate, results, due, to, maternal, inheritance, of, the, chloroplast, dna, chemical, and, molecular, data, from, non, organelle, dna, for, example, could, be, more, effective, for, studying, palm, phylogeny, recently, nuclear, genomes, and, transcriptomes, have, been, used, to, reconstruct, the, phylogeny, of, palms, this, has, revealed, for, example, that, a, whole, genome, duplication, event, occurred, early, in, the, evolution, of, the, arecaceae, lineage, that, was, not, experienced, by, its, sister, clade, the, dasypogonaceae, for, a, phylogenetic, tree, of, the, family, see, the, list, of, arecaceae, genera, the, arecaceae, were, the, first, modern, family, of, monocots, to, appear, in, the, fossil, record, around, 80, million, years, ago, mya, during, the, late, cretaceous, period, the, first, modern, species, such, as, nypa, fruticans, and, acrocomia, aculeata, appeared, 69, mya, as, evidenced, by, fossil, nypa, pollen, palms, appear, to, have, undergone, an, early, period, of, adaptive, radiation, by, 60, mya, many, of, the, modern, specialized, genera, of, palms, appeared, and, became, widespread, and, common, much, more, widespread, than, their, range, today, because, palms, separated, from, the, monocots, earlier, than, other, families, they, developed, more, intrafamilial, specialization, and, diversity, by, tracing, back, these, diverse, characteristics, of, palms, to, the, basic, structures, of, monocots, palms, may, be, valuable, in, studying, monocot, evolution, several, species, of, palms, have, been, identified, from, flowers, preserved, in, amber, including, palaeoraphe, dominicana, and, roystonea, palaea, fossil, evidence, of, them, can, also, be, found, in, samples, of, petrified, palmwood, the, relationship, between, the, subfamilies, is, shown, in, the, following, cladogram, calamoideae, nypoideae, coryphoideae, ceroxyloideae, arecoideae, human, use, of, palms, is, at, least, as, old, as, human, civilization, itself, starting, with, the, cultivation, of, the, date, palm, by, mesopotamians, and, other, middle, eastern, peoples, 5, 000, years, or, more, ago, date, wood, pits, for, storing, dates, and, other, remains, of, the, date, palm, have, been, found, in, mesopotamian, sites, the, date, palm, had, a, significant, effect, on, the, history, of, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, in, the, text, date, palm, products, 1993, w, h, barreveld, wrote, one, could, go, as, far, as, to, say, that, had, the, date, palm, not, existed, the, expansion, of, the, human, race, into, the, hot, and, barren, parts, of, the, old, world, would, have, been, much, more, restricted, the, date, palm, not, only, provided, a, concentrated, energy, food, which, could, be, easily, stored, and, carried, along, on, long, journeys, across, the, deserts, it, also, created, a, more, amenable, habitat, for, the, people, to, live, in, by, providing, shade, and, protection, from, the, desert, winds, an, indication, of, the, importance, of, palms, in, ancient, times, is, that, they, are, mentioned, more, than, 30, times, in, the, bible, and, at, least, 22, times, in, the, quran, the, torah, also, references, the, 70, date, palm, trees, which, symbolize, the, 70, aspects, of, torah, that, are, revealed, to, those, who, eat, of, its, fruit, arecaceae, have, great, economic, importance, including, coconut, products, oils, dates, palm, syrup, ivory, nuts, carnauba, wax, rattan, cane, raffia, and, palm, wood, this, family, supplies, a, large, amount, of, the, human, diet, and, several, other, human, uses, both, by, absolute, amount, produced, and, by, number, of, species, domesticated, this, is, far, higher, than, almost, any, other, plant, family, sixth, out, of, domesticated, crops, in, the, human, diet, and, first, in, total, economic, value, produced, sharing, the, top, spot, with, the, poaceae, and, fabaceae, these, human, uses, have, also, spread, many, arecaceae, species, around, the, world, along, with, dates, mentioned, above, members, of, the, palm, family, with, human, uses, are, numerous, like, many, other, plants, palms, have, been, threatened, by, human, intervention, and, exploitation, the, greatest, risk, to, palms, is, destruction, of, habitat, especially, in, the, tropical, forests, due, to, urbanization, wood, chipping, mining, and, conversion, to, farmland, palms, rarely, reproduce, after, such, great, changes, in, the, habitat, and, those, with, small, habitat, ranges, are, most, vulnerable, to, them, the, harvesting, of, heart, of, palm, a, delicacy, in, salads, also, poses, a, threat, because, it, is, derived, from, the, palm, s, apical, meristem, a, vital, part, of, the, palm, that, cannot, be, regrown, except, in, domesticated, varieties, e, g, of, peach, palm, the, use, of, rattan, palms, in, furniture, has, caused, a, major, population, decrease, in, these, species, that, has, negatively, affected, local, and, international, markets, as, well, as, biodiversity, in, the, area, the, sale, of, seeds, to, nurseries, and, collectors, is, another, threat, as, the, seeds, of, popular, palms, are, sometimes, harvested, directly, from, the, wild, in, 2006, at, least, 100, palm, species, were, considered, endangered, and, nine, species, have, been, reported, as, recently, extinct, however, several, factors, make, palm, conservation, more, difficult, palms, live, in, almost, every, type, of, warm, habitat, and, have, tremendous, morphological, diversity, most, palm, seeds, lose, viability, quickly, and, they, cannot, be, preserved, in, low, temperatures, because, the, cold, kills, the, embryo, using, botanical, gardens, for, conservation, also, presents, problems, since, they, can, rarely, house, more, than, a, few, plants, of, any, species, or, truly, imitate, the, natural, setting, there, is, also, the, risk, that, cross, pollination, can, lead, to, hybrid, species, the, palm, specialist, group, of, the, world, conservation, union, iucn, began, in, 1984, and, has, performed, a, series, of, three, studies, to, find, basic, information, on, the, status, of, palms, in, the, wild, use, of, wild, palms, and, palms, under, cultivation, two, projects, on, palm, conservation, and, use, supported, by, the, world, wildlife, fund, took, place, from, 1985, to, 1990, and, 1986, 1991, in, the, american, tropics, and, southeast, asia, respectively, both, studies, produced, copious, new, data, and, publications, on, palms, preparation, of, a, global, action, plan, for, palm, conservation, began, in, 1991, supported, by, the, iucn, and, was, published, in, 1996, the, rarest, palm, known, is, hyophorbe, amaricaulis, the, only, living, individual, remains, at, the, botanic, gardens, of, curepipe, in, mauritius, some, pests, are, specialists, to, particular, taxa, pests, that, attack, a, variety, of, species, of, palms, include, the, palm, branch, was, a, symbol, of, triumph, and, victory, in, classical, antiquity, the, romans, rewarded, champions, of, the, games, and, celebrated, military, successes, with, palm, branches, early, christians, used, the, palm, branch, to, symbolize, the, victory, of, the, faithful, over, enemies, of, the, soul, as, in, the, palm, sunday, festival, celebrating, the, triumphal, entry, of, jesus, christ, into, jerusalem, in, judaism, the, palm, represents, peace, and, plenty, and, is, one, of, the, four, species, of, sukkot, the, palm, may, also, symbolize, the, tree, of, life, in, kabbalah, the, canopies, of, the, rathayatra, carts, which, carry, the, deities, of, krishna, and, his, family, members, in, the, cart, festival, of, jagganath, puri, in, india, are, marked, with, the, emblem, of, a, palm, tree, specifically, it, is, the, symbol, of, krishna, s, brother, baladeva, in, 1840, the, american, geologist, edward, hitchcock, 1793, 1864, published, the, first, tree, like, paleontology, chart, in, his, elementary, geology, with, two, separate, trees, of, life, for, the, plants, and, the, animals, these, are, crowned, graphically, with, the, palms, and, with, man, today, the, palm, especially, the, coconut, palm, remains, a, symbol, of, the, tropical, island, paradise, palms, appear, on, the, flags, and, seals, of, several, places, where, they, are, native, including, those, of, haiti, guam, saudi, arabia, florida, and, south, carolina, some, species, commonly, called, palms, though, they, are, not, true, palms, include
