cetartiodactyla, montgelard, et, al, 1997, artiodactyls, are, placental, mammals, belonging, to, the, order, artiodactyla, r, t, i, o, d, k, t, l, ar, tee, oh, dak, tih, l, from, ancient, greek, rtios, even, and, d, ktylos, finger, toe, typically, they, are, ungulates, which, bear, weight, equally, on, two, an, even, number, of, their, five, toes, the, third, and, fourth, often, in, the, form, of, a, hoof, the, other, three, toes, are, either, present, absent, vestigial, or, pointing, posteriorly, by, contrast, most, perissodactyls, bear, weight, on, an, odd, number, of, the, five, toes, another, difference, between, the, two, orders, is, that, many, artiodactyls, except, for, suina, digest, plant, cellulose, in, one, or, more, stomach, chambers, rather, than, in, their, intestine, as, perissodactyls, do, molecular, biology, along, with, new, fossil, discoveries, has, found, that, cetaceans, whales, dolphins, and, porpoises, fall, within, this, taxonomic, branch, being, most, closely, related, to, hippopotamuses, some, modern, taxonomists, thus, apply, the, name, cetartiodactyla, s, t, r, t, i, o, d, k, t, l, to, this, group, while, others, opt, to, include, cetaceans, within, the, existing, name, of, artiodactyla, some, researchers, use, even, toed, ungulates, to, exclude, cetaceans, and, only, include, terrestrial, artiodactyls, making, the, term, paraphyletic, in, nature, the, roughly, 270, land, based, even, toed, ungulate, species, include, pigs, peccaries, hippopotamuses, antelopes, deer, giraffes, camels, llamas, alpacas, sheep, goats, and, cattle, many, are, herbivores, but, suids, are, omnivorous, whereas, cetaceans, are, entirely, carnivorous, artiodactyls, are, also, known, by, many, extinct, groups, such, as, anoplotheres, cainotheriids, merycoidodonts, entelodonts, anthracotheres, basilosaurids, and, palaeomerycids, many, artiodactyls, are, of, great, dietary, economic, and, cultural, importance, to, humans, the, oldest, fossils, of, even, toed, ungulates, date, back, to, the, early, eocene, about, 53, million, years, ago, since, these, findings, almost, simultaneously, appeared, in, europe, asia, and, north, america, it, is, very, difficult, to, accurately, determine, the, origin, of, artiodactyls, the, fossils, are, classified, as, belonging, to, the, family, diacodexeidae, their, best, known, and, best, preserved, member, is, diacodexis, these, were, small, animals, some, as, small, as, a, hare, with, a, slim, build, lanky, legs, and, a, long, tail, their, hind, legs, were, much, longer, than, their, front, legs, the, early, to, middle, eocene, saw, the, emergence, of, the, ancestors, of, most, of, today, s, mammals, two, formerly, widespread, but, now, extinct, families, of, even, toed, ungulates, were, entelodontidae, and, anthracotheriidae, entelodonts, existed, from, the, middle, eocene, to, the, early, miocene, in, eurasia, and, north, america, they, had, a, stocky, body, with, short, legs, and, a, massive, head, which, was, characterized, by, two, humps, on, the, lower, jaw, bone, anthracotheres, had, a, large, porcine, pig, like, build, with, short, legs, and, an, elongated, muzzle, this, group, appeared, in, the, middle, eocene, up, until, the, pliocene, and, spread, throughout, eurasia, africa, and, north, america, anthracotheres, are, thought, to, be, the, ancestors, of, hippos, and, likewise, probably, led, a, similar, aquatic, lifestyle, hippopotamuses, appeared, in, the, late, miocene, and, occupied, africa, and, asia, they, never, got, to, the, americas, the, camels, tylopoda, were, during, large, parts, of, the, cenozoic, limited, to, north, america, early, forms, like, cainotheriidae, occupied, europe, among, the, north, american, camels, were, groups, like, the, stocky, short, legged, merycoidodontidae, they, first, appeared, in, the, late, eocene, and, developed, a, great, diversity, of, species, in, north, america, only, in, the, late, miocene, or, early, pliocene, did, they, migrate, from, north, america, into, eurasia, the, north, american, varieties, became, extinct, around, 10, 000, years, ago, suina, including, pigs, have, been, around, since, the, eocene, in, the, late, eocene, or, the, oligocene, two, families, stayed, in, eurasia, and, africa, the, peccaries, which, became, extinct, in, the, old, world, exist, today, only, in, the, americas, south, america, was, settled, by, even, toed, ungulates, only, in, the, pliocene, after, the, land, bridge, at, the, isthmus, of, panama, formed, some, three, million, years, ago, with, only, the, peccaries, lamoids, or, llamas, and, various, species, of, capreoline, deer, south, america, has, comparatively, fewer, artiodactyl, families, than, other, continents, except, australia, which, has, no, native, species, the, classification, of, artiodactyls, was, hotly, debated, because, ocean, dwelling, cetaceans, evolved, from, land, dwelling, even, toed, ungulates, some, semiaquatic, even, toed, ungulates, hippopotamuses, are, more, closely, related, to, ocean, dwelling, cetaceans, than, to, other, even, toed, ungulates, phylogenetic, classification, only, recognizes, monophyletic, taxa, that, is, groups, that, descend, from, a, common, ancestor, and, include, all, of, its, descendants, to, address, this, problem, the, traditional, order, artiodactyla, and, infraorder, cetacea, are, sometimes, subsumed, into, the, more, inclusive, cetartiodactyla, taxon, an, alternative, approach, is, to, include, both, land, dwelling, even, toed, ungulates, and, ocean, dwelling, cetaceans, in, a, revised, artiodactyla, taxon, in, the, 1990s, biological, systematics, used, not, only, morphology, and, fossils, to, classify, organisms, but, also, molecular, biology, molecular, biology, involves, sequencing, an, organism, s, dna, and, rna, and, comparing, the, sequence, with, that, of, other, living, beings, the, more, similar, they, are, the, more, closely, they, are, related, comparison, of, even, toed, ungulate, and, cetaceans, genetic, material, has, shown, that, the, closest, living, relatives, of, whales, and, hippopotamuses, is, the, paraphyletic, group, artiodactyla, dan, graur, and, desmond, higgins, were, among, the, first, to, come, to, this, conclusion, and, included, a, paper, published, in, 1994, however, they, did, not, recognize, hippopotamuses, and, classified, the, ruminants, as, the, sister, group, of, cetaceans, subsequent, studies, established, the, close, relationship, between, hippopotamuses, and, cetaceans, these, studies, were, based, on, casein, genes, sines, fibrinogen, sequences, cytochrome, and, rrna, sequences, irbp, and, vwf, gene, sequences, adrenergic, receptors, and, apolipoproteins, in, 2001, the, fossil, limbs, of, a, pakicetus, amphibioid, cetacean, the, size, of, a, wolf, and, ichthyolestes, an, early, whale, the, size, of, a, fox, were, found, in, pakistan, they, were, both, archaeocetes, ancient, whales, from, about, 48, million, years, ago, in, the, eocene, these, findings, showed, that, archaeocetes, were, more, terrestrial, than, previously, thought, and, that, the, special, construction, of, the, talus, ankle, bone, with, a, double, rolled, joint, surface, previously, thought, to, be, unique, to, even, toed, ungulates, were, also, in, early, cetaceans, the, mesonychians, another, type, of, ungulate, did, not, show, this, special, construction, of, the, talus, and, thus, was, concluded, to, not, have, the, same, ancestors, as, cetaceans, the, oldest, cetaceans, date, back, to, the, early, eocene, 53, million, years, ago, whereas, the, oldest, known, hippopotamus, dates, back, only, to, the, miocene, 15, million, years, ago, the, hippopotamids, are, descended, from, the, anthracotheres, a, family, of, semiaquatic, and, terrestrial, artiodactyls, that, appeared, in, the, late, eocene, and, are, thought, to, have, resembled, small, or, narrow, headed, hippos, research, is, therefore, focused, on, anthracotheres, family, anthracotheriidae, one, dating, from, the, eocene, to, miocene, was, declared, to, be, hippo, like, upon, discovery, in, the, 19th, century, a, study, from, 2005, showed, that, the, anthracotheres, and, hippopotamuses, had, very, similar, skulls, but, differed, in, the, adaptations, of, their, teeth, it, was, nevertheless, believed, that, cetaceans, and, anthracothereres, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, and, that, hippopotamuses, developed, from, anthracotheres, a, study, published, in, 2015, confirmed, this, but, also, revealed, that, hippopotamuses, were, derived, from, older, anthracotherians, the, newly, introduced, genus, epirigenys, from, eastern, africa, is, thus, the, sister, group, of, hippos, linnaeus, postulated, a, close, relationship, between, camels, and, ruminants, as, early, as, the, mid, 1700s, henri, de, blainville, recognized, the, similar, anatomy, of, the, limbs, of, pigs, and, hippos, and, british, zoologist, richard, owen, coined, the, term, even, toed, ungulates, and, the, scientific, name, artiodactyla, in, 1848, internal, morphology, mainly, the, stomach, and, the, molars, were, used, for, classification, suines, including, pigs, and, hippopotamuses, have, molars, with, well, developed, roots, and, a, simple, stomach, that, digests, food, thus, they, were, grouped, together, as, non, ruminants, porcine, all, other, even, toed, ungulates, have, molars, with, a, selenodont, construction, crescent, shaped, cusps, and, have, the, ability, to, ruminate, which, requires, regurgitating, food, and, re, chewing, it, differences, in, stomach, construction, indicated, that, rumination, evolved, independently, between, tylopods, and, ruminants, therefore, tylopods, were, excluded, from, ruminantia, the, taxonomy, that, was, widely, accepted, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, was, suidae, hippopotamidae, tylopoda, tragulidae, pecora, modern, cetaceans, are, highly, adapted, sea, creatures, which, morphologically, have, little, in, common, with, land, mammals, they, are, similar, to, other, marine, mammals, such, as, seals, and, sea, cows, due, to, convergent, evolution, however, they, evolved, from, originally, terrestrial, mammals, the, most, likely, ancestors, were, long, thought, to, be, mesonychians, large, carnivorous, animals, from, the, early, cenozoic, paleocene, and, eocene, which, had, hooves, instead, of, claws, on, their, feet, their, molars, were, adapted, to, a, carnivorous, diet, resembling, the, teeth, in, modern, toothed, whales, and, unlike, other, mammals, had, a, uniform, construction, the, suspected, relations, can, be, shown, as, follows, artiodactyla, mesonychia, cetacea, molecular, findings, and, morphological, indications, suggest, that, artiodactyls, as, traditionally, defined, are, paraphyletic, with, respect, to, cetaceans, cetaceans, are, deeply, nested, within, the, former, the, two, groups, together, form, a, monophyletic, taxon, for, which, the, name, cetartiodactyla, is, sometimes, used, modern, nomenclature, divides, artiodactyla, or, cetartiodactyla, in, four, subordinate, taxa, camelids, tylopoda, pigs, and, peccaries, suina, ruminants, ruminantia, and, hippos, plus, whales, whippomorpha, the, presumed, lineages, within, artiodactyla, can, be, represented, in, the, following, cladogram, tylopoda, camels, suina, pigs, tragulidae, mouse, deer, pecora, horn, bearers, hippopotamidae, hippopotamuses, cetacea, whales, the, four, summarized, artiodactyla, taxa, are, divided, into, ten, extant, families, although, deer, musk, deer, and, pronghorns, have, traditionally, been, summarized, as, cervids, cervioidea, molecular, studies, provide, different, and, inconsistent, results, so, the, question, of, phylogenetic, systematics, of, infraorder, pecora, the, horned, ruminants, for, the, time, being, cannot, be, answered, artiodactyls, are, generally, quadrupeds, two, major, body, types, are, known, suinids, and, hippopotamuses, are, characterized, by, a, stocky, body, short, legs, and, a, large, head, camels, and, ruminants, though, have, a, more, slender, build, and, lanky, legs, size, varies, considerably, the, smallest, member, the, mouse, deer, often, reaches, a, body, length, of, only, 45, centimeters, 18, in, and, a, weight, of, 1, 5, kilograms, 3, 3, lb, the, largest, member, the, hippopotamus, can, grow, up, to, 5, meters, 16, ft, in, length, and, weigh, 4, 5, metric, tons, 5, short, tons, and, the, giraffe, can, grow, to, be, 5, 5, meters, 18, ft, tall, and, 4, 7, meters, 15, ft, in, body, length, all, even, toed, ungulates, display, some, form, of, sexual, dimorphism, the, males, are, consistently, larger, and, heavier, than, the, females, in, deer, only, the, males, boast, antlers, and, the, horns, of, bovines, are, usually, small, or, not, present, in, females, male, indian, antelopes, have, a, much, darker, coat, than, females, almost, all, even, toed, ungulates, have, fur, with, the, exception, being, the, nearly, hairless, hippopotamus, fur, varies, in, length, and, coloration, depending, on, the, habitat, species, in, cooler, regions, can, shed, their, coat, camouflaged, coats, come, in, colors, of, yellow, gray, brown, or, black, tones, even, toed, ungulates, bear, their, name, because, they, have, an, even, number, of, toes, two, or, four, in, some, peccaries, the, hind, legs, have, a, reduction, in, the, number, of, toes, to, three, the, central, axis, of, the, leg, is, between, the, third, and, fourth, toe, the, first, toe, is, missing, in, modern, artiodactyls, and, can, only, be, found, in, now, extinct, genera, the, second, and, fifth, toes, are, adapted, differently, between, species, when, camels, have, only, two, toes, present, the, claws, are, transformed, into, nails, while, both, are, made, of, keratin, claws, are, curved, and, pointed, while, nails, are, flat, and, dull, these, claws, consist, of, three, parts, the, plate, top, and, sides, the, sole, bottom, and, the, bale, rear, in, general, the, claws, of, the, forelegs, are, wider, and, blunter, than, those, of, the, hind, legs, and, they, are, farther, apart, aside, from, camels, all, even, toed, ungulates, put, just, the, tip, of, the, foremost, phalanx, on, the, ground, in, even, toed, ungulates, the, bones, of, the, stylopodium, upper, arm, or, thigh, bone, and, zygopodiums, tibia, and, fibula, are, usually, elongated, the, muscles, of, the, limbs, are, predominantly, localized, which, ensures, that, artiodactyls, often, have, very, slender, legs, a, clavicle, is, never, present, and, the, scapula, is, very, agile, and, swings, back, and, forth, for, added, mobility, when, running, the, special, construction, of, the, legs, causes, the, legs, to, be, unable, to, rotate, which, allows, for, greater, stability, when, running, at, high, speeds, in, addition, many, smaller, artiodactyls, have, a, very, flexible, body, contributing, to, their, speed, by, increasing, their, stride, length, many, even, toed, ungulates, have, a, relatively, large, head, the, skull, is, elongated, and, rather, narrow, the, frontal, bone, is, enlarged, near, the, back, and, displaces, the, parietal, bone, which, forms, only, part, of, the, side, of, the, cranium, especially, in, ruminants, four, families, of, even, toed, ungulates, have, cranial, appendages, these, pecora, with, the, exception, of, the, musk, deer, have, one, of, four, types, of, cranial, appendages, true, horns, antlers, ossicones, or, pronghorns, true, horns, have, a, bone, core, that, is, covered, in, a, permanent, sheath, of, keratin, and, are, found, only, in, the, bovids, antlers, are, bony, structures, that, are, shed, and, replaced, each, year, they, are, found, in, deer, members, of, the, family, cervidae, they, grow, from, a, permanent, outgrowth, of, the, frontal, bone, called, the, pedicle, and, can, be, branched, as, in, the, white, tailed, deer, odocoileus, virginianus, or, palmate, as, in, the, moose, alces, alces, ossicones, are, permanent, bone, structures, that, fuse, to, the, frontal, or, parietal, bones, during, an, animal, s, life, and, are, found, only, in, the, giraffidae, pronghorns, while, similar, to, horns, in, that, they, have, keratinous, sheaths, covering, permanent, bone, cores, are, deciduous, all, these, cranial, appendages, can, serve, for, posturing, battling, for, mating, privilege, and, for, defense, in, almost, all, cases, they, are, sexually, dimorphic, and, are, often, found, only, on, the, males, one, exception, is, the, species, rangifer, tarandus, known, as, reindeer, in, europe, or, caribou, in, north, america, where, both, sexes, can, grow, antlers, yearly, though, the, females, antlers, are, typically, smaller, and, not, always, present, there, are, two, trends, in, terms, of, teeth, within, artiodactyla, the, suina, and, hippopotamuses, have, a, relatively, large, number, of, teeth, with, some, pigs, having, 44, their, dentition, is, more, adapted, to, a, squeezing, mastication, which, is, characteristic, of, omnivores, camels, and, ruminants, have, fewer, teeth, there, is, often, a, yawning, diastema, a, designated, gap, in, the, teeth, where, the, molars, are, aligned, for, crushing, plant, matter, the, incisors, are, often, reduced, in, ruminants, and, are, completely, absent, in, the, upper, jaw, the, canines, are, enlarged, and, tusk, like, in, the, suina, and, are, used, for, digging, in, the, ground, and, for, defense, in, ruminants, the, males, upper, canines, are, enlarged, and, used, as, a, weapon, in, certain, species, mouse, deer, musk, deer, water, deer, species, with, frontal, weapons, are, usually, missing, the, upper, canines, the, lower, canines, of, ruminants, resemble, the, incisors, so, that, these, animals, have, eight, uniform, teeth, in, the, frontal, part, of, the, lower, jaw, the, molars, of, porcine, have, only, a, few, bumps, in, contrast, camels, and, ruminants, have, bumps, that, are, crescent, shaped, cusps, selenodont, artiodactyls, have, a, well, developed, sense, of, smell, and, sense, of, hearing, unlike, many, other, mammals, they, have, a, poor, sense, of, sight, moving, objects, are, much, easier, to, see, than, stationary, ones, similar, to, many, other, prey, animals, their, eyes, are, on, the, sides, of, the, head, giving, them, an, almost, panoramic, view, the, ruminants, ruminantia, ruminate, their, food, they, regurgitate, and, re, chew, it, ruminants, mouths, often, have, additional, salivary, glands, and, the, oral, mucosa, is, often, heavily, calloused, to, avoid, injury, from, hard, plant, parts, and, to, allow, easier, transport, of, roughly, chewed, food, their, stomachs, are, divided, into, three, to, four, sections, the, rumen, the, reticulum, the, omasum, and, the, abomasum, after, the, food, is, ingested, it, is, mixed, with, saliva, in, the, rumen, and, reticulum, and, separates, into, layers, of, solid, versus, liquid, material, the, solids, lump, together, to, form, a, bolus, also, known, as, the, cud, this, is, regurgitated, by, reticular, contractions, while, the, glottis, is, closed, when, the, bolus, enters, the, mouth, the, fluid, is, squeezed, out, with, the, tongue, and, re, swallowed, the, bolus, is, chewed, slowly, to, completely, mix, it, with, saliva, and, to, break, it, down, ingested, food, passes, to, the, fermentation, chamber, rumen, and, reticulum, where, it, is, kept, in, continual, motion, by, rhythmic, contractions, cellulytic, microbes, bacteria, protozoa, and, fungi, produce, cellulase, which, is, needed, to, break, down, the, cellulose, found, in, plant, material, this, form, of, digestion, has, two, advantages, plants, that, are, indigestible, to, other, species, can, be, digested, and, used, and, the, duration, of, the, actual, food, consumption, shortened, the, animal, spends, only, a, short, time, out, in, the, open, with, its, head, to, the, ground, rumination, can, take, place, later, in, a, sheltered, area, tylopoda, camels, llamas, and, alpacas, and, chevrotains, have, three, chambered, stomachs, while, the, rest, of, ruminantia, have, four, chambered, stomachs, the, handicap, of, a, heavy, digestive, system, has, increased, selective, pressure, towards, limbs, that, allow, the, animal, to, quickly, escape, predators, most, species, within, suina, have, a, simple, two, chambered, stomach, that, allows, for, an, omnivorous, diet, the, babirusa, however, is, a, herbivore, and, has, extra, maxillary, teeth, to, allow, for, proper, mastication, of, plant, material, most, of, the, fermentation, occurs, with, the, help, of, cellulolytic, microorganisms, within, the, caecum, of, the, large, intestine, peccaries, have, a, complex, stomach, that, contains, four, compartments, their, fore, stomach, has, fermentation, carried, out, by, microbes, and, has, high, levels, of, volatile, fatty, acid, it, has, been, proposed, that, their, complex, fore, stomach, is, a, means, to, slow, digestive, passage, and, increase, digestive, efficiency, hippopotamuses, have, three, chambered, stomachs, and, do, not, ruminate, they, consume, around, 68, kilograms, 150, lb, of, grass, and, other, plant, matter, each, night, they, may, cover, distances, up, to, 32, kilometers, 20, mi, to, obtain, food, which, they, digest, with, the, help, of, microbes, that, produce, cellulase, their, closest, living, relatives, the, whales, are, obligate, carnivores, unlike, other, even, toed, ungulates, pigs, have, a, simple, sack, shaped, stomach, some, artiodactyla, such, as, white, tailed, deer, lack, a, gall, bladder, the, penises, of, even, toed, ungulates, have, an, s, shape, at, rest, and, lie, in, a, pocket, under, the, skin, on, the, belly, the, corpora, cavernosa, are, only, slightly, developed, and, an, erection, mainly, causes, this, curvature, to, extend, which, leads, to, an, extension, but, not, a, thickening, of, the, penis, cetaceans, have, similar, penises, in, some, even, toed, ungulates, the, penis, contains, a, structure, called, the, urethral, process, the, testicles, are, located, in, the, scrotum, and, thus, outside, the, abdominal, cavity, the, ovaries, of, many, females, descend, as, the, testicles, descend, of, many, male, mammals, and, are, close, to, the, pelvic, inlet, at, the, level, of, the, fourth, lumbar, vertebra, the, uterus, has, two, horns, uterus, bicornis, the, number, of, mammary, glands, is, variable, and, correlates, as, in, all, mammals, with, litter, size, pigs, which, have, the, largest, litter, size, of, all, even, toed, ungulates, have, two, rows, of, teats, lined, from, the, armpit, to, the, groin, area, in, most, cases, however, even, toed, ungulates, have, only, one, or, two, pairs, of, teats, in, some, species, these, form, an, udder, in, the, groin, region, secretory, glands, in, the, skin, are, present, in, virtually, all, species, and, can, be, located, in, different, places, such, as, in, the, eyes, behind, the, horns, the, neck, or, back, on, the, feet, or, in, the, anal, region, artiodactyls, have, a, carotid, rete, heat, exchange, that, enables, them, unlike, perissodactyls, which, lack, one, to, regulate, their, brain, temperature, independently, of, their, bodies, it, has, been, argued, that, its, presence, explains, the, greater, success, of, artiodactyls, compared, to, perissodactyls, in, being, able, to, adapt, to, diverse, environments, from, the, arctic, circle, to, deserts, and, tropical, savannahs, artiodactyls, are, native, to, almost, all, parts, of, the, world, with, the, exception, of, oceania, and, antarctica, humans, have, introduced, different, artiodactyls, worldwide, as, hunting, animals, artiodactyls, inhabit, almost, every, habitat, from, tropical, rainforests, and, steppes, to, deserts, and, high, mountain, regions, the, greatest, biodiversity, prevails, in, open, habitats, such, as, grasslands, and, open, forests, the, social, behavior, of, even, toed, ungulates, varies, from, species, to, species, generally, there, is, a, tendency, to, merge, into, larger, groups, but, some, live, alone, or, in, pairs, species, living, in, groups, often, have, a, hierarchy, both, among, males, and, females, some, species, also, live, in, harem, groups, with, one, male, several, females, and, their, common, offspring, in, other, species, the, females, and, juveniles, stay, together, while, males, are, solitary, or, live, in, bachelor, groups, and, seek, out, females, only, during, mating, season, many, artiodactyls, are, territorial, and, mark, their, territory, for, example, with, glandular, secretions, or, urine, in, addition, to, year, round, sedentary, species, there, are, animals, that, migrate, seasonally, there, are, diurnal, crepuscular, and, nocturnal, artiodactyls, some, species, pattern, of, wakefulness, varies, with, season, or, habitat, generally, even, toed, ungulates, tend, to, have, long, gestation, periods, smaller, litter, sizes, and, more, highly, developed, newborns, as, with, many, other, mammals, species, in, temperate, or, polar, regions, have, a, fixed, mating, season, while, those, in,

expectancy, is, typically, twenty, to, thirty, years, as, in, many, mammals, smaller, species, often, have, a, shorter, lifespan, than, larger, species, the, artiodactyls, with, the, longest, lifespans, are, the, hippos, cows, and, camels, which, can, live, 40, to, 50, years, artiodactyls, have, different, natural, predators, depending, on, their, size, and, habitat, there, are, several, carnivores, that, prey, on, them, including, large, cats, e, g, lions, and, bears, other, predators, are, crocodiles, wolves, and, dogs, large, raptors, and, for, small, species, and, young, animals,

nematodes, botflies, fleas, lice, or, flukes, but, they, have, debilitating, effects, only, when, the, infestation, is, severe, artiodactyls, have, been, hunted, by, primitive, humans, for, various, reasons, for, meat, or, fur, as, well, as, to, use, their, bones, and, teeth, as, weapons, or, tools, their, domestication, began, around, 8000, bce, to, date, humans, have, domesticated, goats, sheep, cattle, camels, llamas, alpacas, and, pigs, initially, livestock, was, used, primarily, for, food, but, they, began, being, used, for, work, activities, around, 3000, bce, clear, evidence,

s, pets, some, artiodactyls, also, benefit, from, the, fact, that, their, predators, e, g, the, tasmanian, tiger, were, severely, decimated, by, ranchers, who, saw, them, as, competition, conversely, many, artiodactyls, have, declined, significantly, in, numbers, and, some, have, even, gone, extinct, largely, due, to, over, hunting, and, more, recently, habitat, destruction, extinct, species,
