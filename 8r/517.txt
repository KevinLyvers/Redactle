see, text, groupers, are, fish, of, any, of, a, number, of, genera, in, the, subfamily, epinephelinae, of, the, family, serranidae, in, the, order, perciformes, not, all, serranids, are, called, groupers, the, family, also, includes, the, sea, basses, the, common, name, grouper, is, usually, given, to, fish, in, one, of, two, large, genera, epinephelus, and, mycteroperca, in, addition, the, species, classified, in, the, small, genera, anyperidon, cromileptes, dermatolepis, graciela, saloptia, and, triso, are, also, called, groupers, fish, in, the, genus, plectropomus, are, referred, to, as, coral, groupers, these, genera, are, all, classified, in, the, subfamily, epiphelinae, however, some, of, the, hamlets, genus, alphestes, the, hinds, genus, cephalopholis, the, lyretails, genus, variola, and, some, other, small, genera, gonioplectrus, niphon, paranthias, are, also, in, this, subfamily, and, occasional, species, in, other, serranid, genera, have, common, names, involving, the, word, grouper, nonetheless, the, word, grouper, on, its, own, is, usually, taken, as, meaning, the, subfamily, epinephelinae, groupers, are, teleosts, typically, having, a, stout, body, and, a, large, mouth, they, are, not, built, for, long, distance, fast, swimming, they, can, be, quite, large, in, length, over, a, meter, the, largest, is, the, atlantic, goliath, grouper, epinephelus, itajara, which, has, been, weighed, at, 399, kilograms, 880, pounds, and, a, length, of, 2, 43, m, 7, ft, 11, 1, 2, in, though, in, such, a, large, group, species, vary, considerably, they, swallow, prey, rather, than, biting, pieces, off, of, them, they, do, not, have, many, teeth, on, the, edges, of, their, jaws, but, they, have, heavy, crushing, tooth, plates, inside, the, pharynx, they, habitually, eat, fish, octopuses, and, crustaceans, some, species, prefer, to, ambush, their, prey, while, others, are, active, predators, reports, of, fatal, attacks, on, humans, by, the, largest, species, such, as, the, giant, grouper, epinephelus, lanceolatus, are, unconfirmed, their, mouths, and, gills, form, a, powerful, vacuum, that, pulls, their, prey, in, from, a, distance, they, also, use, their, mouths, to, dig, into, sand, to, form, their, shelters, under, big, rocks, jetting, it, out, through, their, gills, research, indicates, roving, coralgroupers, plectropomus, pessuliferus, sometimes, cooperate, with, giant, morays, in, hunting, groupers, are, also, one, of, the, only, animals, that, eat, invasive, red, lionfish, the, word, grouper, is, from, the, portuguese, name, garoupa, which, has, been, speculated, to, come, from, an, indigenous, south, american, language, in, australia, groper, is, used, instead, of, grouper, for, several, species, such, as, the, queensland, grouper, epinephelus, lanceolatus, in, new, zealand, groper, refers, to, a, type, of, wreckfish, polyprion, oxygeneios, which, goes, by, the, name, hapuka, from, the, m, ori, language, h, puku, in, the, philippines, groupers, are, generally, known, as, lapu, lapu, in, luzon, while, in, the, visayas, and, mindanao, they, are, known, as, pugapo, its, indonesian, name, is, kerapu, in, the, middle, east, the, fish, is, known, as, hammour, and, is, widely, eaten, especially, in, the, persian, gulf, region, in, latin, america, the, fish, is, known, as, mero, the, species, in, the, tribes, grammistini, and, diploprionini, secrete, a, mucus, like, toxin, in, their, skin, called, grammistin, and, when, they, are, confined, in, a, restricted, space, and, subjected, to, stress, the, mucus, produces, a, foam, that, is, toxic, to, nearby, fish, these, fishes, are, often, called, soapfishes, they, have, been, classified, either, as, their, own, families, or, within, subfamilies, although, the, fifth, edition, of, the, fishes, of, the, world, classifies, these, two, groups, as, tribes, within, the, subfamily, epinephelinae, according, to, the, 5th, edition, of, fishes, of, the, world, the, subfamily, is, divided, up, into, 5, tribes, containing, a, total, of, 32, genera, and, 234, species, subfamily, epinephelinae, bleeker, 1874, groupers, groupers, are, mostly, monandric, protogynous, hermaphrodites, i, e, they, mature, only, as, females, and, can, change, sex, after, sexual, maturity, some, species, of, groupers, grow, about, a, kilogram, per, year, and, are, generally, adolescents, until, they, reach, three, kilograms, when, they, become, female, the, largest, males, often, control, harems, containing, three, to, 15, females, groupers, often, pair, spawn, which, enables, large, males, to, competitively, exclude, smaller, males, from, reproducing, as, such, if, a, small, female, grouper, were, to, change, sex, before, it, could, control, a, harem, as, a, male, its, fitness, would, decrease, if, no, male, is, available, the, largest, female, that, can, increase, fitness, by, changing, sex, will, do, so, however, some, groupers, are, gonochoristic, gonochorism, or, a, reproductive, strategy, with, two, distinct, sexes, has, evolved, independently, in, groupers, at, least, five, times, the, evolution, of, gonochorism, is, linked, to, group, spawning, high, amounts, of, habitat, cover, both, group, spawning, and, habitat, cover, increase, the, likelihood, of, a, smaller, male, reproducing, in, the, presence, of, large, males, the, fitness, of, male, groupers, in, environments, where, competitive, exclusion, of, smaller, males, is, impossible, is, correlated, with, sperm, production, and, thus, testicle, size, gonochoristic, groupers, have, larger, testes, than, protogynous, groupers, 10, of, body, mass, compared, to, 1, of, body, mass, indicating, the, evolution, of, gonochorism, increased, male, grouper, fitness, in, environments, where, large, males, were, unable, to, competitively, exclude, small, males, from, reproducing, like, other, fish, groupers, harbor, parasites, including, digeneans, nematodes, cestodes, monogeneans, isopods, and, copepods, a, study, conducted, in, new, caledonia, has, shown, that, coral, reef, associated, groupers, have, about, ten, species, of, parasites, per, fish, species, species, of, pseudorhabdosynochus, monogeneans, of, the, family, diplectanidae, are, typical, of, and, especially, numerous, on, groupers, many, groupers, are, important, food, fish, some, are, now, farmed, unlike, most, other, fish, species, which, are, chilled, or, frozen, groupers, are, usually, sold, alive, in, markets, many, species, are, popular, game, fish, for, sea, angling, some, species, are, small, enough, to, be, kept, in, aquaria, though, even, the, small, species, are, inclined, to, grow, rapidly, groupers, are, commonly, reported, as, a, source, of, ciguatera, fish, poisoning, dna, barcoding, of, grouper, species, might, help, control, ciguatera, fish, poisoning, since, fish, are, easily, identified, even, from, meal, remnants, with, molecular, tools, malaysian, newspaper, the, star, reported, a, 180, kg, 400, lb, grouper, being, caught, off, the, waters, near, pulau, sembilan, in, the, strait, of, malacca, in, january, 2008, shenzhen, news, in, china, reported, that, a, 1, 8, m, 6, ft, grouper, swallowed, a, 1, 0, m, 3, ft, 3, in, whitetip, reef, shark, at, the, fuzhou, sea, world, aquarium, in, september, 2010, a, costa, rican, newspaper, reported, a, 2, 3, m, 7, ft, 7, in, grouper, in, cieneguita, lim, n, the, weight, of, the, fish, was, 250, kg, 550, lb, and, it, was, lured, using, one, kilogram, of, bait, in, november, 2013, a, 310,
