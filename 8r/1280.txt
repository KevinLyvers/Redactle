the, leg, is, the, entire, lower, limb, of, the, human, body, including, the, foot, thigh, or, sometimes, even, the, hip, or, buttock, region, the, major, bones, of, the, leg, are, the, femur, thigh, bone, tibia, shin, bone, and, adjacent, fibula, the, thigh, is, between, the, hip, and, knee, while, the, calf, rear, and, shin, front, or, shank, are, between, the, knee, and, ankle, legs, are, used, for, standing, many, forms, of, human, movement, recreation, such, as, dancing, and, constitute, a, significant, portion, of, a, person, s, mass, evolution, has, led, to, the, human, leg, s, development, into, a, mechanism, specifically, adapted, for, efficient, bipedal, gait, while, the, capacity, to, walk, upright, is, not, unique, to, humans, other, primates, can, only, achieve, this, for, short, periods, and, at, a, great, expenditure, of, energy, in, humans, female, legs, generally, have, greater, hip, anteversion, and, tibiofemoral, angles, while, male, legs, have, longer, femur, and, tibial, lengths, in, humans, each, lower, limb, is, divided, into, the, hip, thigh, knee, leg, ankle, and, foot, in, anatomy, just, as, arm, refers, to, the, upper, arm, leg, refers, to, the, lower, leg, in, human, anatomy, the, lower, leg, is, the, part, of, the, lower, limb, that, lies, between, the, knee, and, the, ankle, anatomists, restrict, the, term, leg, to, this, use, rather, than, to, the, entire, lower, limb, the, thigh, is, between, the, hip, and, knee, and, makes, up, the, rest, of, the, lower, limb, the, term, lower, limb, or, lower, extremity, is, commonly, used, to, describe, all, of, the, leg, the, leg, from, the, knee, to, the, ankle, is, called, the, crus, the, calf, is, the, back, portion, and, the, tibia, or, shinbone, together, with, the, smaller, fibula, make, up, the, shin, the, front, of, the, lower, leg, evolution, has, provided, the, human, body, with, two, distinct, features, the, specialization, of, the, upper, limb, for, visually, guided, manipulation, and, the, lower, limb, s, development, into, a, mechanism, specifically, adapted, for, efficient, bipedal, gait, while, the, capacity, to, walk, upright, is, not, unique, to, humans, other, primates, can, only, achieve, this, for, short, periods, and, at, a, great, expenditure, of, energy, the, human, adaption, to, bipedalism, has, also, affected, the, location, of, the, body, s, center, of, gravity, the, reorganization, of, internal, organs, and, the, form, and, biomechanism, of, the, trunk, in, humans, the, double, s, shaped, vertebral, column, acts, as, a, great, shock, absorber, which, shifts, the, weight, from, the, trunk, over, the, load, bearing, surface, of, the, feet, the, human, legs, are, exceptionally, long, and, powerful, as, a, result, of, their, exclusive, specialization, for, support, and, locomotion, in, orangutans, the, leg, length, is, 111, of, the, trunk, in, chimpanzees, 128, and, in, humans, 171, many, of, the, leg, s, muscles, are, also, adapted, to, bipedalism, most, substantially, the, gluteal, muscles, the, extensors, of, the, knee, joint, and, the, calf, muscles, the, major, bones, of, the, leg, are, the, femur, thigh, bone, tibia, shin, bone, and, adjacent, fibula, and, these, are, all, long, bones, the, patella, kneecap, is, the, sesamoid, bone, in, front, of, the, knee, most, of, the, leg, skeleton, has, bony, prominences, and, margins, that, can, be, palpated, and, some, serve, as, anatomical, landmarks, that, define, the, extent, of, the, leg, these, landmarks, are, the, anterior, superior, iliac, spine, the, greater, trochanter, the, superior, margin, of, the, medial, condyle, of, tibia, and, the, medial, malleolus, notable, exceptions, to, palpation, are, the, hip, joint, and, the, neck, and, body, or, shaft, of, the, femur, usually, the, large, joints, of, the, lower, limb, are, aligned, in, a, straight, line, which, represents, the, mechanical, longitudinal, axis, of, the, leg, the, mikulicz, line, this, line, stretches, from, the, hip, joint, or, more, precisely, the, head, of, the, femur, through, the, knee, joint, the, intercondylar, eminence, of, the, tibia, and, down, to, the, center, of, the, ankle, the, ankle, mortise, the, fork, like, grip, between, the, medial, and, lateral, malleoli, in, the, tibial, shaft, the, mechanical, and, anatomical, axes, coincide, but, in, the, femoral, shaft, they, diverge, 6, resulting, in, the, femorotibial, angle, of, 174, in, a, leg, with, normal, axial, alignment, a, leg, is, considered, straight, when, with, the, feet, brought, together, both, the, medial, malleoli, of, the, ankle, and, the, medial, condyles, of, the, knee, are, touching, divergence, from, the, normal, femorotibial, angle, is, called, genu, varum, if, the, center, of, the, knee, joint, is, lateral, to, the, mechanical, axis, intermalleolar, distance, exceeds, 3, cm, and, genu, valgum, if, it, is, medial, to, the, mechanical, axis, intercondylar, distance, exceeds, 5, cm, these, conditions, impose, unbalanced, loads, on, the, joints, and, stretching, of, either, the, thigh, s, adductors, and, abductors, the, angle, of, inclination, formed, between, the, neck, and, shaft, of, the, femur, collodiaphysial, angle, varies, with, age, about, 150, in, the, newborn, it, gradually, decreases, to, 126, 128, in, adults, to, reach, 120, in, old, age, pathological, changes, in, this, angle, result, in, abnormal, posture, of, the, leg, a, small, angle, produces, coxa, vara, and, a, large, angle, coxa, valga, the, latter, is, usually, combined, with, genu, varum, and, coxa, vara, leads, genu, valgum, additionally, a, line, drawn, through, the, femoral, neck, superimposed, on, a, line, drawn, through, the, femoral, condyles, forms, an, angle, the, torsion, angle, which, makes, it, possible, for, flexion, movements, of, the, hip, joint, to, be, transposed, into, rotary, movements, of, the, femoral, head, abnormally, increased, torsion, angles, result, in, a, limb, turned, inward, and, a, decreased, angle, in, a, limb, turned, outward, both, cases, resulting, in, a, reduced, range, of, a, person, s, mobility, sartorius, gluteus, maximus, quadratus, femoris, obturator, internus, gluteus, medius, and, gluteus, minimus, iliopsoas, with, psoas, major, obturator, externus, all, functional, adductors, except, gracilis, and,

externus, semitendinosus, there, are, several, ways, of, classifying, the, muscles, of, the, hip, some, hip, muscles, also, act, either, on, the, knee, joint, or, on, vertebral, joints, additionally, because, the, areas, of, origin, and, insertion, of, many, of, these, muscles, are, very, extensive, these, muscles, are, often, involved, in, several, very, different, movements, in, the, hip, joint, lateral, and, medial, rotation, occur, along, the, axis, of, the, limb, extension, also, called, dorsiflexion, or, retroversion, and, flexion, anteflexion, or, anteversion, occur, along, a, transverse, axis, and, abduction, and, adduction, occur, about, a, sagittal, axis, the, anterior, dorsal, hip, muscles, are, the, iliopsoas, a, group, of, two, or, three, muscles, with, a, shared, insertion, on, the, lesser, trochanter, of, the, femur, the, psoas, major, originates, from, the, last, vertebra, and, along, the, lumbar, spine, to, stretch, down, into, the, pelvis, the, iliacus, originates, on, the, iliac, fossa, on, the, interior, side, of, the, pelvis, the, two, muscles, unite, to, form, the, iliopsoas, muscle, which, is, inserted, on, the, lesser, trochanter, of, the, femur, the, psoas, minor, only, present, in, about, 50, per, cent, of, subjects, originates, above, the, psoas, major, to, stretch, obliquely, down, to, its, insertion, on, the, interior, side, of, the, major, muscle, the, posterior, dorsal, hip, muscles, are, inserted, on, or, directly, below, the, greater, trochanter, of, the, femur, the, tensor, fasciae, latae, stretching, from, the, anterior, superior, iliac, spine, down, into, the, iliotibial, tract, presses, the, head, of, the, femur, into, the, acetabulum, but, also, flexes, rotates, medially, and, abducts, to, hip, joint, the, piriformis, originates, on, the, anterior, pelvic, surface, of, the, sacrum, passes, through, the, greater, sciatic, foramen, and, inserts, on, the, posterior, aspect, of, the, tip, of, the, greater, trochanter, in, a, standing, posture, it, is, a, lateral, rotator, but, it, also, assists, extending, the, thigh, the, gluteus, maximus, has, its, origin, between, and, around, the, iliac, crest, and, the, coccyx, from, where, one, part, radiates, into, the, iliotibial, tract, and, the, other, stretches, down, to, the, gluteal, tuberosity, under, the, greater, trochanter, the, gluteus, maximus, is, primarily, an, extensor, and, lateral, rotator, of, the, hip, joint, and, it, comes, into, action, when, climbing, stairs, or, rising, from, a, sitting, to, a, standing, posture, furthermore, the, part, inserted, into, the, fascia, latae, abducts, and, the, part, inserted, into, the, gluteal, tuberosity, adducts, the, hip, the, two, deep, glutei, muscles, the, gluteus, medius, and, minimus, originate, on, the, lateral, side, of, the, pelvis, the, medius, muscle, is, shaped, like, a, cap, its, anterior, fibers, act, as, a, medial, rotator, and, flexor, the, posterior, fibers, as, a, lateral, rotator, and, extensor, and, the, entire, muscle, abducts, the, hip, the, minimus, has, similar, functions, and, both, muscles, are, inserted, onto, the, greater, trochanter, the, ventral, hip, muscles, function, as, lateral, rotators, and, play, an, important, role, in, the, control, of, the, body, s, balance, because, they, are, stronger, than, the, medial, rotators, in, the, normal, position, of, the, leg, the, apex, of, the, foot, is, pointing, outward, to, achieve, better, support, the, obturator, internus, originates, on, the, pelvis, on, the, obturator, foramen, and, its, membrane, passes, through, the, lesser, sciatic, foramen, and, is, inserted, on, the, trochanteric, fossa, of, the, femur, bent, over, the, lesser, sciatic, notch, which, acts, as, a, fulcrum, the, muscle, forms, the, strongest, lateral, rotators, of, the, hip, together, with, the, gluteus, maximus, and, quadratus, femoris, when, sitting, with, the, knees, flexed, it, acts, as, an, abductor, the, obturator, externus, has, a, parallel, course, with, its, origin, located, on, the, posterior, border, of, the, obturator, foramen, it, is, covered, by, several, muscles, and, acts, as, a, lateral, rotator, and, a, weak, adductor, the, inferior, and, superior, gemelli, muscles, represent, marginal, heads, of, the, obturator, internus, and, assist, this, muscle, these, three, muscles, form, a, three, headed, muscle, tricipital, known, as, the, triceps, coxae, the, quadratus, femoris, originates, at, the, ischial, tuberosity, and, is, inserted, onto, the, intertrochanteric, crest, between, the, trochanters, this, flattened, muscle, act, as, a, strong, lateral, rotator, and, adductor, of, the, thigh, the, adductor, muscles, of, the, thigh, are, innervated, by, the, obturator, nerve, with, the, exception, of, pectineus, which, receives, fibers, from, the, femoral, nerve, and, the, adductor, magnus, which, receives, fibers, from, the, tibial, nerve, the, gracilis, arises, from, near, the, pubic, symphysis, and, is, unique, among, the, adductors, in, that, it, reaches, past, the, knee, to, attach, on, the, medial, side, of, the, shaft, of, the, tibia, thus, acting, on, two, joints, it, share, its, distal, insertion, with, the, sartorius, and, semitendinosus, all, three, muscles, forming, the, pes, anserinus, it, is, the, most, medial, muscle, of, the, adductors, and, with, the, thigh, abducted, its, origin, can, be, clearly, seen, arching, under, the, skin, with, the, knee, extended, it, adducts, the, thigh, and, flexes, the, hip, the, pectineus, has, its, origin, on, the, iliopubic, eminence, laterally, to, the, gracilis, and, rectangular, in, shape, extends, obliquely, to, attach, immediately, behind, the, lesser, trochanter, and, down, the, pectineal, line, and, the, proximal, part, of, the, linea, aspera, on, the, femur, it, is, a, flexor, of, the, hip, joint, and, an, adductor, and, a, weak, medial, rotator, of, the, thigh, the, adductor, brevis, originates, on, the, inferior, ramus, of, the, pubis, below, the, gracilis, and, stretches, obliquely, below, the, pectineus, down, to, the, upper, third, of, the, linea, aspera, except, for, being, an, adductor, it, is, a, lateral, rotator, and, weak, flexor, of, the, hip, joint, the, adductor, longus, has, its, origin, at, superior, ramus, of, the, pubis, and, inserts, medially, on, the, middle, third, of, the, linea, aspera, primarily, an, adductor, it, is, also, responsible, for, some, flexion, the, adductor, magnus, has, its, origin, just, behind, the, longus, and, lies, deep, to, it, its, wide, belly, divides, into, two, parts, one, is, inserted, into, the, linea, aspera, and, the, tendon, of, the, other, reaches, down, to, adductor, tubercle, on, the, medial, side, of, the, femur, s, distal, end, where, it, forms, an, intermuscular, septum, that, separates, the, flexors, from, the, extensors, magnus, is, a, powerful, adductor, especially, active, when, crossing, legs, its, superior, part, is, a, lateral, rotator, but, the, inferior, part, acts, as, a, medial, rotator, on, the, flexed, leg, when, rotated, outward, and, also, extends, the, hip, joint, the, adductor, minimus, is, an, incompletely, separated, subdivision, of, the, adductor, magnus, its, origin, forms, an, anterior, part, of, the, magnus, and, distally, it, is, inserted, on, the, linea, aspera, above, the, magnus, it, acts, to, adduct, and, lateral, rotate, the, femur, quadriceps, femoris, tensor, fasciae, latae, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, biceps, femoris, gracilis, sartorius, popliteus, gastrocnemius, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, gracilis, sartorius, popliteus, biceps, femoris, tensor, fasciae, latae, the, muscles, of, the, thigh, can, be, classified, into, three, groups, according, to, their, location, anterior, and, posterior, muscles, and, the, adductors, on, the, medial, side, all, the, adductors, except, gracilis, insert, on, the, femur, and, act, on, the, hip, joint, and, so, functionally, qualify, as, hip, muscles, the, majority, of, the, thigh, muscles, the, true, thigh, muscles, insert, on, the, leg, either, the, tibia, or, the, fibula, and, act, primarily, on, the, knee, joint, generally, the, extensors, lie, on, anterior, of, the, thigh, and, flexors, lie, on, the, posterior, even, though, the, sartorius, flexes, the, knee, it, is, ontogenetically, considered, an, extensor, since, its, displacement, is, secondary, of, the, anterior, thigh, muscles, the, largest, are, the, four, muscles, of, the, quadriceps, femoris, the, central, rectus, femoris, which, is, surrounded, by, the, three, vasti, the, vastus, intermedius, medialis, and, lateralis, rectus, femoris, is, attached, to, the, pelvis, with, two, tendons, while, the, vasti, are, inserted, to, the, femur, all, four, muscles, unite, in, a, common, tendon, inserted, into, the, patella, from, where, the, patellar, ligament, extends, it, down, to, the, tibial, tuberosity, fibers, from, the, medial, and, lateral, vasti, form, two, retinacula, that, stretch, past, the, patella, on, either, sides, down, to, the, condyles, of, the, tibia, the, quadriceps, is, the, knee, extensor, but, the, rectus, femoris, additionally, flexes, the, hip, joint, and, articular, muscle, of, the, knee, protects, the, articular, capsule, of, the, knee, joint, from, being, nipped, during, extension, the, sartorius, runs, superficially, and, obliquely, down, on, the, anterior, side, of, the, thigh, from, the, anterior, superior, iliac, spine, to, the, pes, anserinus, on, the, medial, side, of, the, knee, from, where, it, is, further, extended, into, the, crural, fascia, the, sartorius, acts, as, a, flexor, on, both, the, hip, and, knee, but, due, to, its, oblique, course, also, contributes, to, medial, rotation, of, the, leg, as, one, of, the, pes, anserinus, muscles, with, the, knee, flexed, and, to, lateral, rotation, of, the, hip, joint, there, are, four, posterior, thigh, muscles, the, biceps, femoris, has, two, heads, the, long, head, has, its, origin, on, the, ischial, tuberosity, together, with, the, semitendinosus, and, acts, on, two, joints, the, short, head, originates, from, the, middle, third, of, the, linea, aspera, on, the, shaft, of, the, femur, and, the, lateral, intermuscular, septum, of, thigh, and, acts, on, only, one, joint, these, two, heads, unite, to, form, the, biceps, which, inserts, on, the, head, of, the, fibula, the, biceps, flexes, the, knee, joint, and, rotates, the, flexed, leg, laterally, it, is, the, only, lateral, rotator, of, the, knee, and, thus, has, to, oppose, all, medial, rotator, additionally, the, long, head, extends, the, hip, joint, the, semitendinosus, and, the, semimembranosus, share, their, origin, with, the, long, head, of, the, biceps, and, both, attaches, on, the, medial, side, of, the, proximal, head, of, the, tibia, together, with, the, gracilis, and, sartorius, to, form, the, pes, anserinus, the, semitendinosus, acts, on, two, joints, extension, of, the, hip, flexion, of, the, knee, and, medial, rotation, of, the, leg, distally, the, semimembranosus, tendon, is, divided, into, three, parts, referred, to, as, the, pes, anserinus, profondus, functionally, the, semimembranosus, is, similar, to, the, semitendinosus, and, thus, produces, extension, at, the, hip, joint, and, flexion, and, medial, rotation, at, the, knee, posteriorly, below, the, knee, joint, the, popliteus, stretches, obliquely, from, the, lateral, femoral, epicondyle, down, to, the, posterior, surface, of, the, tibia, the, subpopliteal, bursa, is, located, deep, to, the, muscle, popliteus, flexes, the, knee, joint, and, medially, rotates, the, leg, tibialis, anterior, extensor, digitorum, longus,

crosses, the, tendon, of, the, tibialis, posterior, distally, on, the, tibia, and, the, tendon, of, the, flexor, hallucis, longus, in, the, sole, distally, to, its, division, the, quadratus, plantae, radiates, into, it, and, near, the, middle, phalanges, its, tendons, penetrate, the, tendons, of, the, flexor, digitorum, brevis, in, the, non, weight, bearing, leg, it, plantar, flexes, the, toes, and, foot, and, supinates, in, the, weight, bearing, leg, it, supports, the, plantar, arch, for, the, popliteus, see, above, the, intrinsic, muscles, of, the, foot, muscles, whose, bellies, are, located, in, the, foot, proper, are, either, dorsal, top, or, plantar, sole, on, the, dorsal, side, two, long, extrinsic, extensor, muscles, are, superficial, to, the, intrinsic, muscles, and, their, tendons, form, the, dorsal, aponeurosis, of, the, toes, the, short, intrinsic, extensors, and, the, plantar, and, dorsal, interossei, radiates, into, these, aponeuroses, the, extensor, digitorum, brevis, and, extensor, hallucis, brevis, have, a, common, origin, on, the, anterior, side, of, the, calcaneus, from, where, their, tendons, extend, into, the, dorsal, aponeuroses, of, digits, 1, 4, they, act, to, dorsiflex, these, digits, the, plantar, muscles, can, be, subdivided, into, three, groups, associated, with, three, regions, those, of, the, big, digit, the, little, digit, and, the, region, between, these, two, all, these, muscles, are, covered, by, the, thick, and, dense, plantar, aponeurosis, which, together, with, two, tough, septa, form, the, spaces, of, the, three, groups, these, muscles, and, their, fatty, tissue, function, as, cushions, that, transmit, the, weight, of, the, body, downward, as, a, whole, the, foot, is, a, functional, entity, the, abductor, hallucis, stretches, along, the, medial, edge, of, the, foot, from, the, calcaneus, to, the, base, of, the, first, phalanx, of, the, first, digit, and, the, medial, sesamoid, bone, it, is, an, abductor, and, a, weak, flexor, and, also, helps, maintain, the, arch, of, the, foot, lateral, to, the, abductor, hallucis, is, the, flexor, hallucis, brevis, which, originates, from, the, medial, cuneiform, bone, and, from, the, tendon, of, the, tibialis, posterior, the, flexor, hallucis, has, a, medial, and, a, lateral, head, inserted, laterally, to, the, abductor, hallucis, it, is, an, important, plantar, flexor, which, comes, into, prominent, use, in, classical, ballet, i, e, for, pointe, work, the, adductor, hallucis, has, two, heads, a, stronger, oblique, head, which, arises, from, the, cuboid, and, lateral, cuneiform, bones, and, the, bases, of, the, second, and, third, metatarsals, and, a, transverse, head, which, arises, from, the, distal, ends, of, the, third, fifth, metatarsals, both, heads, are, inserted, on, the, lateral, sesamoid, bone, of, the, first, digit, the, muscle, acts, as, a, tensor, to, the, arches, of, the, foot, but, can, also, adduct, the, first, digit, and, plantar, flex, its, first, phalanx, the, opponens, digiti, minimi, originates, from, the, long, plantar, ligament, and, the, plantar, tendinous, sheath, of, the, fibularis, peroneus, longus, and, is, inserted, on, the, fifth, metatarsal, when, present, it, acts, to, plantar, flex, the, fifth, digit, and, supports, the, plantar, arch, the, flexor, digiti, minimi, arises, from, the, region, of, base, of, the, fifth, metatarsal, and, is, inserted, onto, the, base, of, the, first, phalanx, of, the, fifth, digit, where, it, is, usually, merged, with, the, abductor, of, the, first, digit, it, acts, to, plantar, flex, the, last, digit, the, largest, and, longest, muscles, of, the, little, toe, is, the, abductor, digiti, minimi, stretching, from, the, lateral, process, of, the, calcaneus, with, a, second, attachment, on, the, base, of, the, fifth, metatarsal, to, the, base, of, the, fifth, digit, s, first, phalanx, the, muscle, forms, the, lateral, edge, of, the, sole, except, for, supporting, the, arch, it, plantar, flexes, the, little, toe, and, also, acts, as, an, abductor, the, four, lumbricales, have, their, origin, on, the, tendons, of, the, flexor, digitorum, longus, from, where, they, extend, to, the, medial, side, of, the, bases, of, the, first, phalanx, of, digits, two, five, except, for, reinforcing, the, plantar, arch, they, contribute, to, plantar, flexion, and, move, the, four, digits, toward, the, big, toe, they, are, in, contrast, to, the, lumbricales, of, the, hand, rather, variable, sometimes, absent, and, sometimes, more, than, four, are, present, the, quadratus, plantae, arises, with, two, slips, from, margins, of, the, plantar, surface, of, the, calcaneus, and, is, inserted, into, the, tendon, s, of, the, flexor, digitorum, longus, and, is, known, as, the, plantar, head, of, this, latter, muscle, the, three, plantar, interossei, arise, with, their, single, heads, on, the, medial, side, of, the, third, fifth, metatarsals, and, are, inserted, on, the, bases, of, the, first, phalanges, of, these, digits, the, two, heads, of, the, four, dorsal, interossei, arise, on, two, adjacent, metatarsals, and, merge, in, the, intermediary, spaces, their, distal, attachment, is, on, the, bases, of, the, proximal, phalanges, of, the, second, fourth, digits, the, interossei, are, organized, with, the, second, digit, as, a, longitudinal, axis, the, plantars, act, as, adductors, and, pull, digits, 3, 5, towards, the, second, digit, while, the, dorsals, act, as, abductors, additionally, the, interossei, act, as, plantar, flexors, at, the, metatarsophalangeal, joints, lastly, the, flexor, digitorum, brevis, arises, from, underneath, the, calcaneus, to, insert, its, tendons, on, the, middle, phalanges, of, digit, 2, 4, because, the, tendons, of, the, flexor, digitorum, longus, run, between, these, tendons, the, brevis, is, sometimes, called, perforatus, the, tendons, of, these, two, muscles, are, surrounded, by, a, tendinous, sheath, the, brevis, acts, to, plantar, flex, the, middle, phalanges, flexibility, can, be, simply, defined, as, the, available, range, of, motion, rom, provided, by, a, specific, joint, or, group, of, joints, for, the, most, part, exercises, that, increase, flexibility, are, performed, with, intentions, to, boost, overall, muscle, length, reduce, the, risks, of, injury, and, to, potentially, improve, muscular, performance, in, physical, activity, stretching, muscles, after, engagement, in, any, physical, activity, can, improve, muscular, strength, increase, flexibility, and, reduce, muscle, soreness, if, limited, movement, is, present, within, a, joint, the, insufficient, extensibility, of, the, muscle, or, muscle, group, could, be, restricting, the, activity, of, the, affected, joint, stretching, prior, to, strenuous, physical, activity, has, been, thought, to, increase, muscular, performance, by, extending, the, soft, tissue, past, its, attainable, length, in, order, to, increase, range, of, motion, many, physically, active, individuals, practice, these, techniques, as, a, warm, up, in, order, to, achieve, a, certain, level, of, muscular, preparation, for, specific, exercise, movements, when, stretching, muscles, should, feel, somewhat, uncomfortable, but, not, physically, agonizing, the, arteries, of, the, leg, are, divided, into, a, series, of, segments, in, the, pelvis, area, at, the, level, of, the, last, lumbar, vertebra, the, abdominal, aorta, a, continuation, the, descending, aorta, splits, into, a, pair, of, common, iliac, arteries, these, immediately, split, into, the, internal, and, external, iliac, arteries, the, latter, of, which, descends, along, the, medial, border, of, the, psoas, major, to, exits, the, pelvis, area, through, the, vascular, lacuna, under, the, inguinal, ligament, the, artery, enters, the, thigh, as, the, femoral, artery, which, descends, the, medial, side, of, the, thigh, to, the, adductor, canal, the, canal, passes, from, the, anterior, to, the, posterior, side, of, the, limb, where, the, artery, leaves, through, the, adductor, hiatus, and, becomes, the, popliteal, artery, on, the, back, of, the, knee, the, popliteal, artery, runs, through, the, popliteal, fossa, to, the, popliteal, muscle, where, it, divides, into, anterior, and, posterior, tibial, arteries, in, the, lower, leg, the, anterior, tibial, enters, the, extensor, compartment, near, the, upper, border, of, the, interosseus, membrane, to, descend, between, the, tibialis, anterior, and, the, extensor, hallucis, longus, distal, to, the, superior, and, extensor, retinacula, of, the, foot, it, becomes, the, dorsal, artery, of, the, foot, the, posterior, tibial, forms, a, direct, continuation, of, the, popliteal, artery, which, enters, the, flexor, compartment, of, the, lower, leg, to, descend, behind, the, medial, malleolus, where, it, divides, into, the, medial, and, lateral, plantar, arteries, of, which, the, posterior, branch, gives, rise, to, the, fibular, artery, for, practical, reasons, the, lower, limb, is, subdivided, into, somewhat, arbitrary, regions, the, regions, of, the, hip, are, all, located, in, the, thigh, anteriorly, the, subinguinal, region, is, bounded, by, the, inguinal, ligament, the, sartorius, and, the, pectineus, and, forms, part, of, the, femoral, triangle, which,

sacral, nerves, and, forms, the, coccygeal, plexus, the, lower, leg, and, ankle, need, to, keep, exercised, and, moving, well, as, they, are, the, base, of, the, whole, body, the, lower, extremities, must, be, strong, in, order, to, balance, the, weight, of, the, rest, of, the, body, and, the, gastrocnemius, muscles, take, part, in, much, of, the, blood, circulation, there, are, a, number, of, exercises, that, can, be, done, to, strengthen, the, lower, leg, for, example, in, order, to, activate, plantar, flexors, in, the, deep, plantar, flexors, one, can, sit, on, the, floor, with, the, hips, flexed, the, ankle, neutral, with, knees, fully, extended, as, they, alternate, pushing, their, foot, against, a, wall, or, platform, this, kind, of, exercise, is, beneficial, as, it, hardly, causes, any, fatigue, another, form, of, isometric, exercise, for, the, gastrocnemius, would, be, seated, calf, raises, which, can, be, done, with, or, without, equipment, one, can, be, seated, at, a, table, with, their, feet, flat, on, the, ground, and, then, plantar, flex, both, ankles, so, that, the, heels, are, raised, off, the, floor, and, the, gastrocnemius, flexed, an, alternate, movement, could, be, heel, drop, exercises, with, the, toes, being, propped, on, an, elevated, surface, as, an, opposing, movement, this, would, improve, the, range, of, motion, one, legged, toe, raises, for, the, gastrocnemius, muscle, can, be, performed, by, holding, one, dumbbell, in, one, hand, while, using, the, other, for, balance, and, then, standing, with, one, foot, on, a, plate, the, next, step, would, be, to, plantar, flex, and, keep, the, knee, joint, straight, or, flexed, slightly, the, triceps, surae, is, contracted, during, this, exercise, stabilization, exercises, like, the, bosu, ball, squat, are, also, important, especially, as, they, assist, in, the, ankles, having, to, adjust, to, the, ball, s, form, in, order, to, balance, lower, leg, injuries, are, common, while, running, or, playing, sports, about, 10, of, all, injuries, in, athletes, involve, the, lower, extremities, the, majority, of, athletes, sprain, their, ankles, this, is, mainly, caused, by, the, increased, loads, onto, the, feet, when, they, move, into, the, foot, down, or, in, an, outer, ankle, position, all, areas, of, the, foot, which, are, the, forefoot, midfoot, and, rearfoot, absorb, various, forces, while, running, and, this, can, also, lead, to, injuries, running, and, various, activities, can, cause, stress, fractures, tendinitis, musculotendinous, injuries, or, any, chronic, pain, to, our, lower, extremities, such, as, the, tibia, injuries, to, quadriceps, or, hamstrings, are, caused, by, the, constant, impact, loads, to, the, legs, during, activities, such, as, kicking, a, ball, while, doing, this, type, of, motion, 85, of, that, shock, is, absorbed, to, the, hamstrings, this, can, cause, strain, to, those, muscles, the, most, common, injuries, in, running, involve, the, knees, and, the, feet, various, studies, have, focused, on, the, initial, cause, of, these, running, related, injuries, and, found, that, there, are, many, factors, that, correlate, to, these, injuries, female, distance, runners, who, had, a, history, of, stress, fracture, injuries, had, higher, vertical, impact, forces, than, non, injured, subjects, the, large, forces, onto, the, lower, legs, were, associated, with, gravitational, forces, and, this, correlated, with, patellofemoral, pain, or, potential, knee, injuries, researchers, have, also, found, that, these, running, related, injuries, affect, the, feet, as, well, because, runners, with, previous, injuries, showed, more, foot, eversion, and, over, pronation, while, running, than, non, injured, runners, this, causes, more, loads, and, forces, on, the, medial, side, of, the, foot, causing, more, stress, on, the, tendons, of, the, foot, and, ankle, most, of, these, running, injuries, are, caused, by, overuse, running, longer, distances, weekly, for, a, long, duration, is, a, risk, for, injuring, the, lower, legs, voluntary, stretches, to, the, legs, such, as, the, wall, stretch, condition, the, hamstrings, and, the, calf, muscle, to, various, movements, before, vigorously, working, them, the, environment, and, surroundings, such, as, uneven, terrain, can, cause, the, feet, to, position, in, an, unnatural, way, so, wearing, shoes, that, can, absorb, forces, from, the, ground, s, impact, and, allow, for, stabilizing, the, feet, can, prevent, some, injuries, while, running, as, well, shoes, should, be, structured, to, allow, friction, traction, at, the, shoe, surface, space, for, different, foot, strike, stresses, and, for, comfortable, regular, arches, for, the, feet, the, chance, of, damaging, our, lower, extremities, will, be, reduced, by, having, knowledge, about, some, activities, associated, with, lower, leg, injury, and, developing, a, correct, form, of, running, such, as, not, over, pronating, the, foot, or, overusing, the, legs, preventative, measures, such, as, various, stretches, and, wearing, appropriate, footwear, will, also, reduce, injuries, a, fracture, of, the, leg, can, be, classified, according, to, the, involved, bone, into, lower, leg, and, foot, pain, management, is, critical, in, reducing, the, progression, of, further, injuries, uncomfortable, sensations, and, limiting, alterations, while, walking, and, running, most, individuals, suffer, from, various, pains, in, their, lower, leg, and, foot, due, to, different, factors, muscle, inflammation, strain, tenderness, swelling, and, muscle, tear, from, muscle, overuse, or, incorrect, movement, are, several, conditions, often, experienced, by, athletes, and, the, common, public, during, and, after, high, impact, physical, activities, therefore, suggested, pain, management, mechanisms, are, provided, to, reduce, pain, and, prevent, the, progression, of, injury, a, plantar, fasciitis, foot, stretch, is, one, of, the, recommended, methods, to, reduce, pain, caused, by, plantar, fasciitis, figure, 1, to, do, the, plantar, fascia, stretch, while, sitting, in, a, chair, place, the, ankle, on, the, opposite, knee, and, hold, the, toes, of, the, impaired, foot, slowly, pulling, back, the, stretch, should, be, held, for, approximately, ten, seconds, three, times, per, day, several, methods, can, be, utilized, to, help, control, pain, caused, by, shin, splints, placing, ice, on, the, affected, area, prior, to, and, after, running, will, aid, in, reducing, pain, in, addition, wearing, orthotic, devices, including, a, neoprene, sleeve, figure, 2, and, wearing, appropriate, footwear, such, as, a, foot, arch, can, help, to, eliminate, the, condition, stretching, and, strengthening, of, the, anterior, tibia, or, medial, tibia, by, performing, exercises, of, plantar, and, dorsi, flexors, such, as, calf, stretch, can, also, help, in, easing, the, pain, there, are, numerous, appropriate, approaches, to, handling, pain, resulting, from, achilles, tendinitis, the, primary, action, is, to, rest, activities, that, do, not, provide, additional, stress, to, the, affected, tendon, are, also, recommended, wearing, orthothics, or, prostheses, will, provide, cushion, and, will, prevent, the, affected, achilles, tendon, from, experiencing, further, stress, when, walking, and, performing, therapeutic, stretches, a, few, stretch, modalities, or, eccentric, exercises, such, as, toe, extension, and, flexion, and, calf, and, heel, stretch, are, beneficial, in, lowering, pain, with, achilles, tendinopathy, patients, figure, 4, in, norse, mythology, the, race, of, jotuns, was, born, from, the, legs, of, ymir, in, finnic, mythology, the, earth, was, created, from, the, shards, of, the, egg, of, a, goldeneye, that, fell, from, the, knees, of, ilmatar, while, this, story, isn, t, found, in, other, finno, ugric, mythologies, pavel, melnikov, pechersky, has, noted, several, times, that, the, beauty, of, legs, is, commonly, mentioned, in, mordvin, mythology, as, a, characteristic, of, both, female, mythological, characters, and, real, erzyan, and, mokshan, women, in, medieval, europe, showing, legs, was, one, of, the, biggest, taboos, for, women, especially, the, ones, with, a, high, social, status, in, victorian, england, several, centuries, later, legs, were, not, to, be, mentioned, at, all, not, only, human, ones, but, even, those, of, a, table, or, a, piano, and, referred, to, as, limbs, instead, miniskirts, and, other, clothing, that, reveal, legs, first, became, popular, in, mid, 20th, century, science, fiction, since, then, it, became, mainstream, in, western, cultures, with, female, legs, frequently, being, focused, on, in, films, tv, ads, music, videos,
