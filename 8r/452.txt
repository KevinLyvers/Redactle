hagfish, of, the, class, myxini, m, k, s, a, n, a, also, known, as, hyperotreti, and, order, myxiniformes, m, k, s, n, f, r, m, i, z, are, eel, shaped, jawless, fish, occasionally, called, slime, eels, hagfish, are, the, only, known, living, animals, that, have, a, skull, but, no, vertebral, column, although, they, do, have, rudimentary, vertebrae, hagfish, are, marine, predators, and, scavengers, who, can, defend, themselves, against, other, larger, predators, by, releasing, copious, amounts, of, slime, from, mucous, glands, in, their, skin, although, their, exact, relationship, to, the, only, other, living, group, of, jawless, fish, the, lampreys, was, long, the, subject, of, controversy, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, hagfish, and, lampreys, are, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, jawed, vertebrates, thus, forming, the, clade, cyclostomi, the, oldest, known, stem, group, hagfish, are, known, from, the, late, carboniferous, around, 310, million, years, ago, with, modern, representatives, first, being, recorded, in, the, mid, cretaceous, around, 100, million, years, ago, hagfish, are, typically, about, 50, cm, 19, 7, in, in, length, the, largest, known, species, is, eptatretus, goliath, with, a, specimen, recorded, at, 127, cm, 4, ft, 2, in, while, myxine, kuoi, and, myxine, pequenoi, seem, to, reach, no, more, than, 18, cm, 7, 1, in, some, have, been, seen, as, small, as, 4, cm, 1, 6, in, hagfish, have, elongated, eel, like, bodies, and, paddle, like, tails, the, skin, is, naked, and, covers, the, body, like, a, loosely, fitting, sock, they, are, generally, a, dull, pink, color, and, look, quite, worm, like, they, have, cartilaginous, skulls, although, the, part, surrounding, the, brain, is, composed, primarily, of, a, fibrous, sheath, and, tooth, like, structures, composed, of, keratin, colors, depend, on, the, species, ranging, from, pink, to, blue, grey, and, black, or, white, spots, may, be, present, eyes, are, simple, eyespots, not, lensed, eyes, that, can, resolve, images, hagfish, have, no, true, fins, and, have, six, or, eight, barbels, around, the, mouth, and, a, single, nostril, instead, of, vertically, articulating, jaws, like, gnathostomata, vertebrates, with, jaws, they, have, a, pair, of, horizontally, moving, structures, with, tooth, like, projections, for, pulling, off, food, the, mouth, of, the, hagfish, has, two, pairs, of, horny, comb, shaped, teeth, on, a, cartilaginous, plate, that, protracts, and, retracts, these, teeth, are, used, to, grasp, food, and, draw, it, toward, the, pharynx, its, skin, is, attached, to, the, body, only, along, the, center, ridge, of, the, back, and, at, the, slime, glands, and, is, filled, with, close, to, a, third, of, the, body, s, blood, volume, giving, the, impression, of, a, blood, filled, sack, it, is, assumed, this, is, an, adaptation, to, survive, predator, attacks, the, atlantic, hagfish, representative, of, the, subfamily, myxininae, and, the, pacific, hagfish, representative, of, the, subfamily, eptatretinae, differ, in, that, the, latter, has, muscle, fibers, embedded, in, the, skin, the, resting, position, of, the, pacific, hagfish, also, tends, to, be, coiled, while, that, of, the, atlantic, hagfish, is, stretched, hagfish, can, exude, copious, quantities, of, a, milky, and, fibrous, slime, or, mucus, from, specialized, slime, glands, when, released, in, seawater, the, slime, expands, to, 10, 000, times, its, original, size, in, 0, 4, seconds, this, slime, that, hagfish, excrete, has, very, thin, fibers, that, make, it, more, durable, and, retentive, than, the, slime, excreted, by, other, animals, the, fibers, are, made, of, proteins, and, also, make, the, slime, flexible, if, they, are, caught, by, a, predator, they, can, quickly, release, a, large, amount, of, slime, to, escape, if, they, remain, captured, they, can, tie, themselves, in, an, overhand, knot, and, work, their, way, from, the, head, to, the, tail, of, the, animal, scraping, off, the, slime, and, freeing, themselves, from, their, captor, rheological, investigations, showed, that, hagfish, slime, viscosity, increases, in, elongational, flow, which, favors, gill, clogging, of, suction, feeding, fish, while, its, viscosity, decreases, in, shear, which, facilitates, scraping, off, the, slime, by, the, travelling, knot, recently, the, slime, was, reported, to, entrain, water, in, its, keratin, like, intermediate, filaments, excreted, by, gland, thread, cells, creating, a, slow, to, dissipate, viscoelastic, substance, rather, than, a, simple, gel, it, has, been, shown, to, impair, the, function, of, a, predator, fish, s, gills, in, this, case, the, hagfish, s, mucus, would, clog, the, predator, s, gills, disabling, their, ability, to, respire, the, predator, would, release, the, hagfish, to, avoid, suffocation, because, of, the, mucus, few, marine, predators, target, the, hagfish, other, predators, of, hagfish, are, varieties, of, birds, or, mammals, free, swimming, hagfish, also, slime, when, agitated, and, later, clear, the, mucus, using, the, same, travelling, knot, behavior, the, reported, gill, clogging, effect, suggests, that, the, travelling, knot, behavior, is, useful, or, even, necessary, to, restore, the, hagfish, s, own, gill, function, after, sliming, hagfish, thread, keratin, estk, and, estk, q90501, and, q90502, the, protein, that, make, up, its, slime, filaments, is, under, investigation, as, an, alternative, to, spider, silk, for, use, in, applications, such, as, body, armor, these, alpha, keratin, proteins, in, hagfish, slime, transform, from, an, helical, structure, to, a, stiffer, sheet, structure, when, stretched, with, combined, draw, processing, stretching, and, chemical, crosslinking, recombinant, slime, keratin, turns, into, a, very, strong, fiber, with, an, elastic, modulus, reaching, 20, gpa, when, in, 2017, a, road, accident, on, u, s, highway, 101, resulted, in, 7, 500, pounds, 3, 400, kg, of, hagfish, being, spilled, they, emitted, sufficient, slime, to, cover, the, road, and, a, nearby, car, a, hagfish, generally, respires, by, taking, in, water, through, its, pharynx, past, the, velar, chamber, and, bringing, the, water, through, the, internal, gill, pouches, which, can, vary, in, number, from, five, to, 16, pairs, depending, on, species, the, gill, pouches, open, individually, but, in, myxine, the, openings, have, coalesced, with, canals, running, backwards, from, each, opening, under, the, skin, uniting, to, form, a, common, aperture, on, the, ventral, side, known, as, the, branchial, opening, the, esophagus, is, also, connected, to, the, left, branchial, opening, which, is, therefore, larger, than, the, right, one, through, a, pharyngocutaneous, duct, esophageocutaneous, duct, which, has, no, respiratory, tissue, this, pharyngocutaneous, duct, is, used, to, clear, large, particles, from, the, pharynx, a, function, also, partly, taking, place, through, the, nasopharyngeal, canal, in, other, species, the, coalescence, of, the, gill, openings, is, less, complete, and, in, bdellostoma, each, pouch, opens, separately, to, the, outside, as, in, lampreys, the, unidirectional, water, flow, passing, the, gills, is, produced, by, rolling, and, unrolling, velar, folds, located, inside, a, chamber, developed, from, the, nasohypophyseal, tract, and, is, operated, by, a, complex, set, of, muscles, inserting, into, cartilages, of, the, neurocranium, assisted, by, peristaltic, contractions, of, the, gill, pouches, and, their, ducts, hagfish, also, have, a, well, developed, dermal, capillary, network, that, supplies, the, skin, with, oxygen, when, the, animal, is, buried, in, anoxic, mud, as, well, as, a, high, tolerance, for, both, hypoxia, and, anoxia, with, a, well, developed, anaerobic, metabolism, the, skin, has, also, been, suggested, to, be, capable, of, cutaneous, respiration, the, origins, of, the, vertebrate, nervous, system, are, of, considerable, interest, to, evolutionary, biologists, and, cyclostomes, hagfish, and, lampreys, are, an, important, group, for, answering, this, question, the, complexity, of, the, hagfish, brain, has, been, an, issue, of, debate, since, the, late, 19th, century, with, some, morphologists, suggesting, that, they, do, not, possess, a, cerebellum, while, others, suggest, that, it, is, continuous, with, the, midbrain, it, is, now, considered, that, the, hagfish, neuroanatomy, is, similar, to, that, of, lampreys, a, common, feature, of, both, cyclostomes, is, the, absence, of, myelin, in, neurons, the, brain, of, a, hagfish, has, specific, parts, similar, to, the, brains, of, other, vertebrates, the, dorsal, and, ventral, muscles, located, towards, the, side, of, the, hagfish, body, are, connected, to, spinal, nerves, the, spinal, nerves, that, connect, to, the, muscles, of, the, pharyngeal, wall, grow, individually, to, reach, them, the, hagfish, eye, lacks, a, lens, extraocular, muscles, and, the, three, motor, cranial, nerves, iii, iv, and, vi, found, in, more, complex, vertebrates, which, is, significant, to, the, study, of, the, evolution, of, more, complex, eyes, a, parietal, eye, is, also, absent, in, extant, hagfish, hagfish, eyespots, when, present, can, detect, light, but, as, far, as, it, is, known, none, can, resolve, detailed, images, in, myxine, and, neomyxine, the, eyes, are, partly, covered, by, the, trunk, musculature, paleontological, evidence, suggests, however, that, the, hagfish, eye, is, not, plesiomorphic, but, rather, degenerative, as, fossils, from, the, carboniferous, have, revealed, hagfish, like, vertebrates, with, complex, eyes, this, would, suggest, that, ancestrally, myxini, possessed, complex, eyes, hagfish, are, known, to, have, one, of, the, lowest, blood, pressures, among, the, vertebrates, one, of, the, most, primitive, types, of, fluid, balance, found, in, animals, is, among, these, creatures, whenever, a, rise, in, extracellular, fluid, occurs, the, blood, pressure, rises, and, this, in, turn, is, sensed, by, the, kidney, which, excretes, excess, fluid, they, also, have, the, highest, blood, volume, to, body, mass, of, any, chordate, with, 17, ml, of, blood, per, 100, g, of, mass, the, hagfish, circulatory, system, has, been, of, considerable, interest, to, evolutionary, biologists, and, present, day, readers, of, physiology, some, observers, first, believed, that, the, hagfish, heart, was, not, innervated, as, the, hearts, of, jawed, vertebrates, are, but, further, investigation, revealed, that, the, hagfish, does, have, a, true, innervated, heart, the, hagfish, circulatory, system, also, includes, multiple, accessory, pumps, throughout, the, body, which, are, considered, auxiliary, hearts, hagfish, are, the, only, known, vertebrates, with, osmoregulation, isosmotic, to, their, external, environment, their, renal, function, remains, poorly, described, there, is, a, hypothesis, that, they, excrete, ions, in, bile, salts, hagfish, musculature, differs, from, jawed, vertebrates, in, that, they, have, neither, a, horizontal, septum, nor, a, vertical, septum, which, in, jawed, vertebrates, are, junctions, of, connective, tissue, that, separate, the, hypaxial, musculature, and, epaxial, musculature, they, do, however, have, true, myomeres, and, myosepta, like, all, vertebrates, the, mechanics, of, their, craniofacial, muscles, in, feeding, have, been, investigated, revealing, advantages, and, disadvantages, of, their, dental, plate, in, particular, hagfish, muscles, have, increased, force, and, gape, size, compared, to, similar, sized, jawed, vertebrates, but, lack, the, speed, amplification, given, by, jawed, vertebrates, muscles, suggesting, that, jaws, are, faster, acting, than, hagfish, dental, plates, the, hagfish, skeleton, comprises, the, skull, the, notochord, and, the, caudal, fin, rays, the, first, diagram, of, the, hagfish, endoskeleton, was, made, by, frederick, cole, in, 1905, in, cole, s, monograph, he, described, sections, of, the, skeleton, that, he, termed, pseudo, cartilage, referring, to, its, distinct, properties, compared, to, jawed, chordates, the, lingual, apparatus, of, hagfish, is, composed, of, a, cartilage, base, bearing, two, teeth, covered, plates, dental, plates, articulated, with, a, series, of, large, cartilage, shafts, the, nasal, capsule, is, considerably, expanded, in, hagfish, comprising, a, fibrous, sheath, lined, with, cartilage, rings, in, contrast, to, lampreys, the, braincase, is, noncartilaginous, the, role, of, their, branchial, arches, is, still, highly, speculative, as, hagfish, embryos, undergo, a, caudal, shift, of, the, posterior, pharyngeal, pouches, thus, the, branchial, arches, do, not, support, gills, while, parts, of, the, hagfish, skull, are, thought, to, be, homologous, with, lampreys, they, are, thought, to, have, very, few, elements, homologous, with, jawed, vertebrates, very, little, is, known, about, hagfish, reproduction, obtaining, embryos, and, observing, reproductive, behavior, are, difficult, due, to, the, deep, sea, habitat, of, many, hagfish, species, in, the, wild, females, outnumber, males, with, the, exact, sex, ratio, differing, depending, on, the, species, e, burgeri, for, example, has, nearly, a, 1, 1, ratio, while, m, glutinosa, females, are, significantly, more, common, than, males, some, species, of, hagfish, are, sexually, undifferentiated, before, maturation, and, possess, gonadal, tissue, for, both, ovaries, and, testis, it, has, been, suggested, that, females, develop, earlier, than, males, and, that, this, may, be, the, reason, for, unequal, sex, ratios, hagfish, testis, are, relatively, small, depending, on, species, females, lay, from, one, to, 30, tough, yolky, eggs, these, tend, to, aggregate, due, to, having, velcro, like, tufts, at, either, end, it, is, unclear, how, hagfish, go, about, laying, eggs, although, researchers, have, proposed, three, hypotheses, based, on, observations, of, the, low, percentage, of, males, and, small, testis, the, hypotheses, are, that, female, hagfish, lay, eggs, in, small, crevices, in, rock, formations, the, eggs, are, laid, in, burrow, beneath, the, sand, and, the, slime, produced, by, the, hagfish, is, used, to, hold, the, eggs, in, a, small, area, it, is, worth, noting, that, no, direct, evidence, has, been, found, to, support, any, of, these, hypotheses, hagfish, do, not, have, a, larval, stage, in, contrast, to, lampreys, hagfish, have, a, mesonephric, kidney, and, are, often, neotenic, of, their, pronephric, kidney, the, kidney, s, are, drained, via, mesonephric, archinephric, duct, unlike, many, other, vertebrates, this, duct, is, separate, from, the, reproductive, tract, and, the, proximal, tubule, of, the, nephron, is, also, connected, with, the, coelom, providing, lubrication, the, single, testicle, or, ovary, has, no, transportation, duct, instead, the, gametes, are, released, into, the, coelom, until, they, find, their, way, to, the, posterior, end, of, the, caudal, region, whereby, they, find, an, opening, in, the, digestive, system, the, hagfish, embryo, can, develop, for, as, long, as, 11, months, before, hatching, which, is, shorter, in, comparison, to, other, jawless, vertebrates, not, much, was, known, about, hagfish, embryology, until, recently, when, husbandry, advances, enabled, considerable, insight, into, the, group, s, evolutionary, development, new, insights, into, the, evolution, of, neural, crest, cells, support, the, consensus, that, all, vertebrates, share, these, cells, which, might, be, regulated, by, a, common, subset, of, genes, their, genome, has, a, large, number, of, microchromosomes, which, are, lost, during, the, animal, s, development, leaving, only, the, reproductive, organs, with, a, complete, genome, hagfish, possess, gonadotropins, which, secrete, from, pituitary, glands, to, the, gonads, to, stimulate, development, this, suggests, that, hagfish, have, an, early, version, of, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, gonadal, axis, a, system, which, once, thought, to, be, exclusive, to, the, gnathostomes, some, species, of, hagfish, reproduce, seasonally, stimulated, by, hormones, from, their, pituitary, gland, e, burgeri, is, known, to, reproduce, and, migrate, annually, while, polychaete, marine, worms, on, or, near, the, sea, floor, are, a, major, food, source, hagfish, can, feed, upon, and, often, even, enter, and, eviscerate, the, bodies, of, dead, and, dying, injured, sea, creatures, much, larger, than, themselves, they, are, known, to, devour, their, prey, from, the, inside, hagfish, have, the, ability, to, absorb, dissolved, organic, matter, across, the, skin, and, gill, which, may, be, an, adaptation, to, a, scavenging, lifestyle, allowing, them, to, maximize, sporadic, opportunities, for, feeding, from, an, evolutionary, perspective, hagfish, represent, a, transitory, state, between, the, generalized, nutrient, absorption, pathways, of, aquatic, invertebrates, and, the, more, specialized, digestive, systems, of, aquatic, vertebrates, like, leeches, they, have, a, sluggish, metabolism, and, can, survive, months, between, feedings, their, feeding, behavior, however, appears, quite, vigorous, analysis, of, the, stomach, content, of, several, species, has, revealed, a, large, variety, of, prey, including, polychaetes, shrimp, hermit, crabs, cephalopods, brittle, stars, bony, fishes, sharks, birds, and, whale, flesh, in, captivity, hagfish, are, observed, to, use, the, overhand, knot, behavior, in, reverse, tail, to, head, to, assist, them, in, gaining, mechanical, advantage, to, pull, out, chunks, of, flesh, from, carrion, fish, or, cetaceans, eventually, making, an, opening, to, permit, entry, to, the, interior, of, the, body, cavity, of, larger, carcasses, a, healthy, larger, sea, creature, likely, would, be, able, to, outfight, or, outswim, this, sort, of, assault, this, energetic, opportunism, on, the, part, of, the, hagfish, can, be, a, great, nuisance, to, fishermen, as, they, can, devour, or, spoil, entire, deep, drag, netted, catches, before, they, can, be, pulled, to, the, surface, since, hagfish, are, typically, found, in, large, clusters, on, and, near, the, bottom, a, single, trawler, s, catch, could, contain, several, dozen, or, even, hundreds, of, hagfish, as, bycatch, and, all, the, other, struggling, captive, sea, life, make, easy, prey, for, them, the, digestive, tract, of, the, hagfish, is, unique, among, the, chordates, because, the, food, in, the, gut, is, enclosed, in, a, permeable, membrane, analogous, to, the, peritrophic, matrix, of, insects, they, are, also, able, to, absorb, nutrients, directly, through, their, skin, hagfish, have, also, been, observed, actively, hunting, the, red, bandfish, cepola, haastii, in, its, burrow, possibly, using, their, slime, to, suffocate, the, fish, before, grasping, it, with, their, dental, plates, and, dragging, it, from, the, burrow, originally, myxine, was, included, by, linnaeus, 1758, in, vermes, the, fossil, hagfish, myxinikela, siroka, from, the, late, carboniferous, of, the, united, states, is, the, oldest, known, member, of, the, group, it, is, in, some, respects, more, similar, to, lampreys, but, shows, key, autapomorphies, of, hagfish, in, recent, years, hagfish, have, become, of, special, interest, for, genetic, analysis, investigating, the, relationships, among, chordates, their, classification, as, agnathans, places, hagfish, as, elementary, vertebrates, in, between, invertebrates, and, gnathostomes, however, discussion, has, long, occurred, in, scientific, literature, about, whether, the, hagfish, were, even, invertebrate, using, fossil, data, paleontologists, posited, that, lampreys, are, more, closely, related, to, gnathostomes, than, hagfish, the, term, craniata, was, used, to, refer, to, animals, that, had, a, developed, skull, but, were, not, considered, true, vertebrates, molecular, evidence, in, the, early, 1990s, first, began, suggesting, that, lampreys, and, hagfish, were, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, gnathostomes, the, validity, of, the, taxon, craniata, was, further, examined, by, delarbre, et, al, 2002, using, mtdna, sequence, data, concluding, the, myxini, are, more, closely, related, to, the, hyperoartia, than, to, the, gnathostomata, i, e, that, modern, jawless, fishes, form, a, clade, called, the, cyclostomata, the, argument, is, that, if, the, cyclostomata, are, indeed, monophyletic, vertebrata, would, return, to, its, old, content, gnathostomata, cyclostomata, and, the, name, craniata, being, superfluous, would, become, a, junior, synonym, nowadays, molecular, data, are, almost, unanimously, in, consensus, of, cyclostome, monophyly, with, more, recent, work, being, directed, at, shared, micrornas, between, cyclostomes, and, gnathostomes, the, current, classification, supported, by, molecular, analyses, which, show, that, lampreys, and, hagfishes, are, sister, taxa, as, well, as, the, fact, that, hagfishes, do, in, fact, have, rudimentary, vertebrae, which, places, hagfishes, in, cyclostomata, hagfish, are, in, the, group, cyclostomata, which, includes, jawless, fish, the, group, cyclostomata, is, characterized, by, two, significant, characteristics, keratinous, tooth, plates, and, movement, of, postotic, myomeres, to, the, orbitals, according, to, fossil, record, hagfish, and, lampreys, have, been, estimated, to, have, diverged, from, one, another, during, the, paleozoic, period, an, experiment, used, an, estimation, of, synonymous, and, nonsynonymous, substitutions, for, nucleotides, and, supplemented, that, data, with, pre, existing, data, into, a, clock, that, would, calculate, divergence, times, for, the, taxons, myxine, and, eptatretus, this, data, found, that, the, lineage, diverged, around, 93, 28, mya, however, later, studies, have, found, even, earlier, divergence, times, within, the, group, with, myxine, and, eptatretus, diverging, during, the, triassic, and, the, ancestor, of, rubicundus, diverging, during, other, extant, hagfishes, during, the, permian, hagfish, are, excluded, from, the, subphylum, gnathostomata, because, of, morphological, characteristics, including, the, hagfish, arched, tongue, hagfish, embryos, have, characteristics, of, gnathostomes, and, may, be, plesiomorphic, however, these, characteristics, drastically, change, morphologically, as, the, hagfish, matures, the, following, hagfish, and, lamprey,

skinned, coated, in, spicy, sauce, and, grilled, over, charcoal, or, stir, fried, it, is, especially, popular, in, the, southern, port, cities, of, the, peninsula, such, as, busan, and, coastal, cities, in, south, gyeongsang, province, due, to, their, value, in, korean, cuisine, most, hagfish, caught, for, food, elsewhere, in, the, world, is, fished, with, intent, of, being, exported, to, south, korea, the, inshore, hagfish, found, in, the, northwest, pacific, is, eaten, in, japan, and, south, korea, as, hagfish, slime, binds, vast, amounts, of, liquid, even, at, low, temperatures, it, was, proposed, as, an, energy, saving, alternative, for, the, production, of, tofu, that, does, not, require, heating, the, hagfish, slime, threads, can, be, used, as, ultra, strong, fiber, for, clothing, douglas, fudge, of, chapman, university, has, conducted, research, in, this, area, hagfish, skin, used, in, a, variety, of, clothing, accessories, is, usually, referred, to, as, eel, skin, it, produces, a, particularly, durable, leather, especially, suitable, for, wallets, and, belts
