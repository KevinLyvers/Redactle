the, plesiosauria, or, plesiosaurs, are, an, order, or, clade, of, extinct, mesozoic, marine, reptiles, belonging, to, the, sauropterygia, plesiosaurs, first, appeared, in, the, latest, triassic, period, possibly, in, the, rhaetian, stage, about, 203, million, years, ago, they, became, especially, common, during, the, jurassic, period, thriving, until, their, disappearance, due, to, the, cretaceous, paleogene, extinction, event, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, about, 66, million, years, ago, they, had, a, worldwide, oceanic, distribution, and, some, species, at, least, partly, inhabited, freshwater, environments, plesiosaurs, were, among, the, first, fossil, reptiles, discovered, in, the, beginning, of, the, nineteenth, century, scientists, realised, how, distinctive, their, build, was, and, they, were, named, as, a, separate, order, in, 1835, the, first, plesiosaurian, genus, the, eponymous, plesiosaurus, was, named, in, 1821, since, then, more, than, a, hundred, valid, species, have, been, described, in, the, early, twenty, first, century, the, number, of, discoveries, has, increased, leading, to, an, improved, understanding, of, their, anatomy, relationships, and, way, of, life, plesiosaurs, had, a, broad, flat, body, and, a, short, tail, their, limbs, had, evolved, into, four, long, flippers, which, were, powered, by, strong, muscles, attached, to, wide, bony, plates, formed, by, the, shoulder, girdle, and, the, pelvis, the, flippers, made, a, flying, movement, through, the, water, plesiosaurs, breathed, air, and, bore, live, young, there, are, indications, that, they, were, warm, blooded, plesiosaurs, showed, two, main, morphological, types, some, species, with, the, plesiosauromorph, build, had, sometimes, extremely, long, necks, and, small, heads, these, were, relatively, slow, and, caught, small, sea, animals, other, species, some, of, them, reaching, a, length, of, up, to, seventeen, metres, had, the, pliosauromorph, build, with, a, short, neck, and, a, large, head, these, were, apex, predators, fast, hunters, of, large, prey, the, two, types, are, related, to, the, traditional, strict, division, of, the, plesiosauria, into, two, suborders, the, long, necked, plesiosauroidea, and, the, short, neck, pliosauroidea, modern, research, however, indicates, that, several, long, necked, groups, might, have, had, some, short, necked, members, or, vice, versa, therefore, the, purely, descriptive, terms, plesiosauromorph, and, pliosauromorph, have, been, introduced, which, do, not, imply, a, direct, relationship, plesiosauroidea, and, pliosauroidea, today, have, a, more, limited, meaning, the, term, plesiosaur, is, properly, used, to, refer, to, the, plesiosauria, as, a, whole, but, informally, it, is, sometimes, meant, to, indicate, only, the, long, necked, forms, the, old, plesiosauroidea, skeletal, elements, of, plesiosaurs, are, among, the, first, fossils, of, extinct, reptiles, recognised, as, such, in, 1605, richard, verstegen, of, antwerp, illustrated, in, his, a, restitution, of, decayed, intelligence, plesiosaur, vertebrae, that, he, referred, to, fishes, and, saw, as, proof, that, great, britain, was, once, connected, to, the, european, continent, the, welshman, edward, lhuyd, in, his, lithophylacii, brittannici, ichnographia, from, 1699, also, included, depictions, of, plesiosaur, vertebrae, that, again, were, considered, fish, vertebrae, or, ichthyospondyli, other, naturalists, during, the, seventeenth, century, added, plesiosaur, remains, to, their, collections, such, as, john, woodward, these, were, only, much, later, understood, to, be, of, a, plesiosaurian, nature, and, are, today, partly, preserved, in, the, sedgwick, museum, in, 1719, william, stukeley, described, a, partial, skeleton, of, a, plesiosaur, which, had, been, brought, to, his, attention, by, the, great, grandfather, of, charles, darwin, robert, darwin, of, elston, the, stone, plate, came, from, a, quarry, at, fulbeck, in, lincolnshire, and, had, been, used, with, the, fossil, at, its, underside, to, reinforce, the, slope, of, a, watering, hole, in, elston, in, nottinghamshire, after, the, strange, bones, it, contained, had, been, discovered, it, was, displayed, in, the, local, vicarage, as, the, remains, of, a, sinner, drowned, in, the, great, flood, stukely, affirmed, its, diluvial, nature, but, understood, it, represented, some, sea, creature, perhaps, a, crocodile, or, dolphin, the, specimen, is, today, on, display, at, the, natural, history, museum, and, its, inventory, number, is, nhmuk, pv, r, 1330, formerly, bmnh, r, 1330, it, is, the, earliest, discovered, more, or, less, complete, fossil, reptile, skeleton, in, a, museum, collection, it, can, perhaps, be, referred, to, plesiosaurus, dolichodeirus, during, the, eighteenth, century, the, number, of, english, plesiosaur, discoveries, rapidly, increased, although, these, were, all, of, a, more, or, less, fragmentary, nature, important, collectors, were, the, reverends, william, mounsey, and, baptist, noel, turner, active, in, the, vale, of, belvoir, whose, collections, were, in, 1795, described, by, john, nicholls, in, the, first, part, of, his, the, history, and, antiquities, of, the, county, of, leicestershire, one, of, turner, s, partial, plesiosaur, skeletons, is, still, preserved, as, specimen, nhmuk, pv, r, 45, formerly, bmnh, r, 45, in, the, british, museum, of, natural, history, this, is, today, referred, to, thalassiodracon, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, plesiosaurs, were, still, poorly, known, and, their, special, build, was, not, understood, no, systematic, distinction, was, made, with, ichthyosaurs, so, the, fossils, of, one, group, were, sometimes, combined, with, those, of, the, other, to, obtain, a, more, complete, specimen, in, 1821, a, partial, skeleton, discovered, in, the, collection, of, colonel, thomas, james, birch, was, described, by, william, conybeare, and, henry, thomas, de, la, beche, and, recognised, as, representing, a, distinctive, group, a, new, genus, was, named, plesiosaurus, the, generic, name, was, derived, from, the, greek, pl, sios, closer, to, and, the, latinised, saurus, in, the, meaning, of, saurian, to, express, that, plesiosaurus, was, in, the, chain, of, being, more, closely, positioned, to, the, sauria, particularly, the, crocodile, than, ichthyosaurus, which, had, the, form, of, a, more, lowly, fish, the, name, should, thus, be, rather, read, as, approaching, the, sauria, or, near, reptile, than, as, near, lizard, parts, of, the, specimen, are, still, present, in, the, oxford, university, museum, of, natural, history, soon, afterwards, the, morphology, became, much, better, known, in, 1823, thomas, clark, reported, an, almost, complete, skull, probably, belonging, to, thalassiodracon, which, is, now, preserved, by, the, british, geological, survey, as, specimen, bgs, gsm, 26035, the, same, year, commercial, fossil, collector, mary, anning, and, her, family, uncovered, an, almost, complete, skeleton, at, lyme, regis, in, dorset, england, on, what, is, today, called, the, jurassic, coast, it, was, acquired, by, the, duke, of, buckingham, who, made, it, available, to, the, geologist, william, buckland, he, in, turn, let, it, be, described, by, conybeare, on, 24, february, 1824, in, a, lecture, to, the, geological, society, of, london, during, the, same, meeting, in, which, for, the, first, time, a, dinosaur, was, named, megalosaurus, the, two, finds, revealed, the, unique, and, bizarre, build, of, the, animals, in, 1832, by, professor, buckland, likened, to, a, sea, serpent, run, through, a, turtle, in, 1824, conybeare, also, provided, a, specific, name, to, plesiosaurus, dolichodeirus, meaning, longneck, in, 1848, the, skeleton, was, bought, by, the, british, museum, of, natural, history, and, catalogued, as, specimen, nhmuk, or, 22656, formerly, bmnh, 22656, when, the, lecture, was, published, conybeare, also, named, a, second, species, plesiosaurus, giganteus, this, was, a, short, necked, form, later, assigned, to, the, pliosauroidea, plesiosaurs, became, better, known, to, the, general, public, through, two, lavishly, illustrated, publications, by, the, collector, thomas, hawkins, memoirs, of, ichthyosauri, and, plesiosauri, of, 1834, and, the, book, of, the, great, sea, dragons, of, 1840, hawkins, entertained, a, very, idiosyncratic, view, of, the, animals, seeing, them, as, monstrous, creations, of, the, devil, during, a, pre, adamitic, phase, of, history, hawkins, eventually, sold, his, valuable, and, attractively, restored, specimens, to, the, british, museum, of, natural, history, during, the, first, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, the, number, of, plesiosaur, finds, steadily, increased, especially, through, discoveries, in, the, sea, cliffs, of, lyme, regis, sir, richard, owen, alone, named, nearly, a, hundred, new, species, the, majority, of, their, descriptions, were, however, based, on, isolated, bones, without, sufficient, diagnosis, to, be, able, to, distinguish, them, from, the, other, species, that, had, previously, been, described, many, of, the, new, species, described, at, this, time, have, subsequently, been, invalidated, the, genus, plesiosaurus, is, particularly, problematic, as, the, majority, of, the, new, species, were, placed, in, it, so, that, it, became, a, wastebasket, taxon, gradually, other, genera, were, named, hawkins, had, already, created, new, genera, though, these, are, no, longer, seen, as, valid, in, 1841, owen, named, pliosaurus, brachydeirus, its, etymology, referred, to, the, earlier, plesiosaurus, dolichodeirus, as, it, is, derived, from, pleios, more, fully, reflecting, that, according, to, owen, it, was, closer, to, the, sauria, than, plesiosaurus, its, specific, name, means, with, a, short, neck, later, the, pliosauridae, were, recognised, as, having, a, morphology, fundamentally, different, from, the, plesiosaurids, the, family, plesiosauridae, had, already, been, coined, by, john, edward, gray, in, 1825, in, 1835, henri, marie, ducrotay, de, blainville, named, the, order, plesiosauria, itself, in, the, second, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, important, finds, were, made, outside, of, england, while, this, included, some, german, discoveries, it, mainly, involved, plesiosaurs, found, in, the, sediments, of, the, american, cretaceous, western, interior, seaway, the, niobrara, chalk, one, fossil, in, particular, marked, the, start, of, the, bone, wars, between, the, rival, paleontologists, edward, drinker, cope, and, othniel, charles, marsh, in, 1867, physician, theophilus, turner, near, fort, wallace, in, kansas, uncovered, a, plesiosaur, skeleton, which, he, donated, to, cope, cope, attempted, to, reconstruct, the, animal, on, the, assumption, that, the, longer, extremity, of, the, vertebral, column, was, the, tail, the, shorter, one, the, neck, he, soon, noticed, that, the, skeleton, taking, shape, under, his, hands, had, some, very, special, qualities, the, neck, vertebrae, had, chevrons, and, with, the, tail, vertebrae, the, joint, surfaces, were, orientated, back, to, front, excited, cope, concluded, to, have, discovered, an, entirely, new, group, of, reptiles, the, streptosauria, or, turned, saurians, which, would, be, distinguished, by, reversed, vertebrae, and, a, lack, of, hindlimbs, the, tail, providing, the, main, propulsion, after, having, published, a, description, of, this, animal, followed, by, an, illustration, in, a, textbook, about, reptiles, and, amphibians, cope, invited, marsh, and, joseph, leidy, to, admire, his, new, elasmosaurus, platyurus, having, listened, to, cope, s, interpretation, for, a, while, marsh, suggested, that, a, simpler, explanation, of, the, strange, build, would, be, that, cope, had, reversed, the, vertebral, column, relative, to, the, body, as, a, whole, when, cope, reacted, indignantly, to, this, suggestion, leidy, silently, took, the, skull, and, placed, it, against, the, presumed, last, tail, vertebra, to, which, it, fitted, perfectly, it, was, in, fact, the, first, neck, vertebra, with, still, a, piece, of, the, rear, skull, attached, to, it, mortified, cope, tried, to, destroy, the, entire, edition, of, the, textbook, and, when, this, failed, immediately, published, an, improved, edition, with, a, correct, illustration, but, an, identical, date, of, publication, he, excused, his, mistake, by, claiming, that, he, had, been, misled, by, leidy, himself, who, describing, a, specimen, of, cimoliasaurus, had, also, reversed, the, vertebral, column, marsh, later, claimed, that, the, affair, was, the, cause, of, his, rivalry, with, cope, he, has, since, been, my, bitter, enemy, both, cope, and, marsh, in, their, rivalry, named, many, plesiosaur, genera, and, species, most, of, which, are, today, considered, invalid, around, the, turn, of, the, century, most, plesiosaur, research, was, done, by, a, former, student, of, marsh, professor, samuel, wendell, williston, in, 1914, williston, published, his, water, reptiles, of, the, past, and, present, despite, treating, sea, reptiles, in, general, it, would, for, many, years, remain, the, most, extensive, general, text, on, plesiosaurs, in, 2013, a, first, modern, textbook, was, being, prepared, by, olivier, rieppel, during, the, middle, of, the, twentieth, century, the, usa, remained, an, important, centre, of, research, mainly, through, the, discoveries, of, samuel, paul, welles, whereas, during, the, nineteenth, and, most, of, the, twentieth, century, new, plesiosaurs, were, described, at, a, rate, of, three, or, four, novel, genera, each, decade, the, pace, suddenly, picked, up, in, the, 1990s, with, seventeen, plesiosaurs, being, discovered, in, this, period, the, tempo, of, discovery, accelerated, in, the, early, twenty, first, century, with, about, three, or, four, plesiosaurs, being, named, each, year, this, implies, that, about, half, of, the, known, plesiosaurs, are, relatively, new, to, science, a, result, of, a, far, more, intense, field, research, some, of, this, is, taking, place, away, from, the, traditional, areas, e, g, in, new, sites, developed, in, new, zealand, argentina, chile, norway, japan, china, and, morocco, but, the, locations, of, the, more, original, discoveries, have, proven, to, be, still, productive, with, important, new, finds, in, england, and, germany, some, of, the, new, genera, are, a, renaming, of, already, known, species, which, were, deemed, sufficiently, different, to, warrant, a, separate, genus, name, in, 2002, the, monster, of, aramberri, was, announced, to, the, press, discovered, in, 1982, at, the, village, of, aramberri, in, the, northern, mexican, state, of, nuevo, le, n, it, was, originally, classified, as, a, dinosaur, the, specimen, is, actually, a, very, large, plesiosaur, possibly, reaching, 15, m, 49, ft, in, length, the, media, published, exaggerated, reports, claiming, it, was, 25, metres, 82, ft, long, and, weighed, up, to, 150, 000, kilograms, 330, 000, lb, which, would, have, made, it, among, the, largest, predators, of, all, time, in, 2004, what, appeared, to, be, a, completely, intact, juvenile, plesiosaur, was, discovered, by, a, local, fisherman, at, bridgwater, bay, national, nature, reserve, in, somerset, uk, the, fossil, dating, from, 180, million, years, ago, as, indicated, by, the, ammonites, associated, with, it, measured, 1, 5, metres, 4, ft, 11, in, in, length, and, may, be, related, to, rhomaleosaurus, it, is, probably, the, best, preserved, specimen, of, a, plesiosaur, yet, discovered, in, 2005, the, remains, of, three, plesiosaurs, dolichorhynchops, herschelensis, discovered, in, the, 1990s, near, herschel, saskatchewan, were, found, to, be, a, new, species, by, dr, tamaki, sato, a, japanese, vertebrate, paleontologist, in, 2006, a, combined, team, of, american, and, argentinian, investigators, the, latter, from, the, argentinian, antarctic, institute, and, the, la, plata, museum, found, the, skeleton, of, a, juvenile, plesiosaur, measuring, 1, 5, metres, 4, ft, 11, in, in, length, on, vega, island, in, antarctica, the, fossil, is, currently, on, display, at, the, geological, museum, of, south, dakota, school, of, mines, and, technology, in, 2008, fossil, remains, of, an, undescribed, plesiosaur, that, was, named, predator, x, now, known, as, pliosaurus, funkei, were, unearthed, in, svalbard, it, had, a, length, of, 12, m, 39, ft, and, its, bite, force, of, 149, kilonewtons, 33, 000, lb, f, is, one, of, the, most, powerful, known, in, december, 2017, a, large, skeleton, of, a, plesiosaur, was, found, in, the, continent, of, antarctica, the, oldest, creature, on, the, continent, and, the, first, of, its, species, in, antarctica, not, only, has, the, number, of, field, discoveries, increased, but, also, since, the, 1950s, plesiosaurs, have, been, the, subject, of, more, extensive, theoretical, work, the, methodology, of, cladistics, has, for, the, first, time, allowed, the, exact, calculation, of, their, evolutionary, relationships, several, hypotheses, have, been, published, about, the, way, they, hunted, and, swam, incorporating, general, modern, insights, about, biomechanics, and, ecology, the, many, recent, discoveries, have, tested, these, hypotheses, and, given, rise, to, new, ones, the, plesiosauria, have, their, origins, within, the, sauropterygia, a, group, of, perhaps, archelosaurian, reptiles, that, returned, to, the, sea, an, advanced, sauropterygian, subgroup, the, carnivorous, eusauropterygia, with, small, heads, and, long, necks, split, into, two, branches, during, the, upper, triassic, one, of, these, the, nothosauroidea, kept, functional, elbow, and, knee, joints, but, the, other, the, pistosauria, became, more, fully, adapted, to, a, sea, dwelling, lifestyle, their, vertebral, column, became, stiffer, and, the, main, propulsion, while, swimming, no, longer, came, from, the, tail, but, from, the, limbs, which, changed, into, flippers, the, pistosauria, became, warm, blooded, and, viviparous, giving, birth, to, live, young, early, basal, members, of, the, group, traditionally, called, pistosaurids, were, still, largely, coastal, animals, their, shoulder, girdles, remained, weak, their, pelves, could, not, support, the, power, of, a, strong, swimming, stroke, and, their, flippers, were, blunt, later, a, more, advanced, pistosaurian, group, split, off, the, plesiosauria, these, had, reinforced, shoulder, girdles, flatter, pelves, and, more, pointed, flippers, other, adaptations, allowing, them, to, colonise, the, open, seas, included, stiff, limb, joints, an, increase, in, the, number, of, phalanges, of, the, hand, and, foot, a, tighter, lateral, connection, of, the, finger, and, toe, phalanx, series, and, a, shortened, tail, from, the, earliest, jurassic, the, hettangian, stage, a, rich, radiation, of, plesiosaurs, is, known, implying, that, the, group, must, already, have, diversified, in, the, late, triassic, of, this, diversification, however, only, a, few, very, basal, forms, have, been, discovered, the, subsequent, evolution, of, the, plesiosaurs, is, very, contentious, the, various, cladistic, analyses, have, not, resulted, in, a, consensus, about, the, relationships, between, the, main, plesiosaurian, subgroups, traditionally, plesiosaurs, have, been, divided, into, the, long, necked, plesiosauroidea, and, the, short, necked, pliosauroidea, however, modern, research, suggests, that, some, generally, long, necked, groups, might, have, had, short, necked, members, to, avoid, confusion, between, the, phylogeny, the, evolutionary, relationships, and, the, morphology, the, way, the, animal, is, built, long, necked, forms, are, therefore, called, plesiosauromorph, and, short, necked, forms, are, called, pliosauromorph, without, the, plesiosauromorph, species, necessarily, being, more, closely, related, to, each, other, than, to, the, pliosauromorph, forms, the, latest, common, ancestor, of, the, plesiosauria, was, probably, a, rather, small, short, necked, form, during, the, earliest, jurassic, the, subgroup, with, the, most, species, was, the, rhomaleosauridae, a, possibly, very, basal, split, off, of, species, which, were, also, short, necked, plesiosaurs, in, this, period, were, at, most, five, metres, sixteen, feet, long, by, the, toarcian, about, 180, million, years, ago, other, groups, among, them, the, plesiosauridae, became, more, numerous, and, some, species, developed, longer, necks, resulting, in, total, body, lengths, of, up, to, ten, metres, 33, feet, in, the, middle, of, the, jurassic, very, large, pliosauridae, evolved, these, were, characterized, by, a, large, head, and, a, short, neck, such, as, liopleurodon, and, simolestes, these, forms, had, skulls, up, to, three, metres, ten, feet, long, and, reached, a, length, of, up, to, seventeen, metres, 56, feet, and, a, weight, of, ten, tonnes, the, pliosaurids, had, large, conical, teeth, and, were, the, dominant, marine, carnivores, of, their, time, during, the, same, time, approximately, 160, million, years, ago, the, cryptoclididae, were, present, shorter, species, with, a, long, neck, and, a, small, head, the, leptocleididae, radiated, during, the, early, cretaceous, these, were, rather, small, forms, that, despite, their, short, necks, might, have, been, more, closely, related, to, the, plesiosauridae, than, to, the, pliosauridae, later, in, the, early, cretaceous, the, elasmosauridae, appeared, these, were, among, the, longest, plesiosaurs, reaching, up, to, fifteen, metres, fifty, feet, in, length, due, to, very, long, necks, containing, as, many, as, 76, vertebrae, more, than, any, other, known, vertebrate, pliosauridae, were, still, present, as, is, shown, by, large, predators, such, as, kronosaurus, at, the, beginning, of, the, late, cretaceous, the, ichthyosauria, became, extinct, perhaps, a, plesiosaur, group, evolved, to, fill, their, niches, the, polycotylidae, which, had, short, necks, and, peculiarly, elongated, heads, with, narrow, snouts, during, the, late, cretaceous, the, elasmosaurids, still, had, many, species, all, plesiosaurs, became, extinct, as, a, result, of, the, k, t, event, at, the, end, of, the, cretaceous, period, approximately, 66, million, years, ago, in, modern, phylogeny, clades, are, defined, groups, that, contain, all, species, belonging, to, a, certain, branch, of, the, evolutionary, tree, one, way, to, define, a, clade, is, to, let, it, consist, of, the, last, common, ancestor, of, two, such, species, and, all, its, descendants, such, a, clade, is, called, a, node, clade, in, 2008, patrick, druckenmiller, and, anthony, russell, in, this, way, defined, plesiosauria, as, the, group, consisting, of, the, last, common, ancestor, of, plesiosaurus, dolichocheirus, and, peloneustes, philarchus, and, all, its, descendants, plesiosaurus, and, peloneustes, represented, the, main, subgroups, of, the, plesiosauroidea, and, the, pliosauroidea, and, were, chosen, for, historical, reasons, any, other, species, from, these, groups, would, have, sufficed, plesiosaurs, were, related, to, the, earlier, nothosauridae, that, had, a, more, crocodile, like, body, the, flipper, arrangement, is, unusual, for, aquatic, animals, in, that, probably, all, four, limbs, were, used, to, propel, the, animal, through, the, water, by, up, and, down, movements, another, way, to, define, a, clade, is, to, let, it, consist, of, all, species, more, closely, related, to, a, certain, species, that, one, in, any, case, wishes, to, include, in, the, clade, than, to, another, species, that, one, to, the, contrary, desires, to, exclude, such, a, clade, is, called, a, stem, clade, such, a, definition, has, the, advantage, that, it, is, easier, to, include, all, species, with, a, certain, morphology, plesiosauria, was, in, 2010, by, hillary, ketchum, and, roger, benson, defined, as, such, a, stem, based, taxon, all, taxa, more, closely, related, to, plesiosaurus, dolichodeirus, and, pliosaurus, brachydeirus, than, to, augustasaurus, hagdorni, ketchum, and, benson, 2010, also, coined, a, new, clade, neoplesiosauria, a, node, based, taxon, that, was, defined, by, as, plesiosaurus, dolichodeirus, pliosaurus, brachydeirus, their, most, recent, common, ancestor, and, all, of, its, descendants, the, clade, neoplesiosauria, very, likely, is, materially, identical, to, plesiosauria, sensu, druckenmiller, russell, thus, would, designate, exactly, the, same, species, and, the, term, was, meant, to, be, a, replacement, of, this, concept, benson, et, al, 2012, found, the, traditional, pliosauroidea, to, be, paraphyletic, in, relation, to, plesiosauroidea, rhomaleosauridae, was, found, to, be, outside, neoplesiosauria, but, still, within, plesiosauria, the, early, carnian, pistosaur, bobosaurus, was, found, to, be, one, step, more, advanced, than, augustasaurus, in, relation, to, the, plesiosauria, and, therefore, it, represented, by, definition, the, basalmost, known, plesiosaur, this, analysis, focused, on, basal, plesiosaurs, and, therefore, only, one, derived, pliosaurid, and, one, cryptoclidian, were, included, while, elasmosaurids, were, not, included, at, all, a, more, detailed, analysis, published, by, both, benson, and, druckenmiller, in, 2014, was, not, able, to, resolve, the, relationships, among, the, lineages, at, the, base, of, plesiosauria, the, following, cladogram, follows, an, analysis, by, benson, druckenmiller, 2014, pistosaurus, postcranium, yunguisaurus, augustasaurus, bobosaurus, stratesaurus, eoplesiosaurus, rhomaleosauridae, thalassiodracon, hauffiosaurus, attenborosaurus, marmornectes, thalassophonea, plesiosaurus, eretmosaurus, westphaliasaurus, microcleididae, plesiopterys, cryptoclididae, elasmosauridae, leptocleididae, polycotylidae, in, general, plesiosaurians, varied, in, adult, length, from, between, 1, 5, metres, 4, 9, ft, to, about, 15, metres, 49, ft, the, group, thus, contained, some, of, the, largest, marine, apex, predators, in, the, fossil, record, roughly, equalling, the, longest, ichthyosaurs, mosasaurids, sharks, and, toothed, whales, in, size, some, plesiosaurian, remains, such, as, a, 2, 875, metres, 9, 43, ft, long, set, of, highly, reconstructed, and, fragmentary, lower, jaws, preserved, in, the, oxford, university, museum, and, referable, to, pliosaurus, rossicus, previously, referred, to, stretosaurus, and, liopleurodon, indicated, a, length, of, 17, metres, 56, ft, however, it, was, recently, argued, that, its, size, cannot, be, currently, determined, due, to, their, being, poorly, reconstructed, and, a, length, of, 12, 7, metres, 42, ft, metres, or, less, is, more, likely, mcz, 1285, a, specimen, currently, referable, to, kronosaurus, queenslandicus, from, the, early, cretaceous, of, australia, was, estimated, to, have, a, skull, length, of, 2, 21, 2, 85, m, 7, 3, 9, 4, ft, a, series, of, neck, vertebrae, from, the, kimmeridge, clay, formation, indicate, a, pliosaur, probably, pliosaurus, that, may, have, been, up, to, 14, 4, metres, 47, ft, long, the, typical, plesiosaur, had, a, broad, flat, body, and, a, short, tail, plesiosaurs, retained, their, ancestral, two, pairs, of, limbs, which, had, evolved, into, large, flippers, plesiosaurs, were, related, to, the, earlier, nothosauridae, that, had, a, more, crocodile, like, body, the, flipper, arrangement, is, unusual, for, aquatic, animals, in, that, probably, all, four, limbs, were, used, to, propel, the, animal, through, the, water, by, up, and, down, movements, the, tail, was, most, likely, only, used, for, helping, in, directional, control, this, contrasts, to, the, ichthyosaurs, and, the, later, mosasaurs, in, which, the, tail, provided, the, main, propulsion, to, power, the, flippers, the, shoulder, girdle, and, the, pelvis, had, been, greatly, modified, developing, into, broad, bone, plates, at, the, underside, of, the, body, which, served, as, an, attachment, surface, for, large, muscle, groups, able, to, pull, the, limbs, downwards, in, the, shoulder, the, coracoid, had, become, the, largest, element, covering, the, major, part, of, the, breast, the, scapula, was, much, smaller, forming, the, outer, front, edge, of, the, trunk, to, the, middle, it, continued, into, a, clavicle, and, finally, a, small, interclavicular, bone, as, with, most, tetrapods, the, shoulder, joint, was, formed, by, the, scapula, and, coracoid, in, the, pelvis, the, bone, plate, was, formed, by, the, ischium, at, the, rear, and, the, larger, pubic, bone, in, front, of, it, the, ilium, which, in, land, vertebrates, bears, the, weight, of, the, hindlimb, had, become, a, small, element, at, the, rear, no, longer, attached, to, either, the, pubic, bone, or, the, thighbone, the, hip, joint, was, formed, by, the, ischium, and, the, pubic, bone, the, pectoral, and, pelvic, plates, were, connected, by, a, plastron, a, bone, cage, formed, by, the, paired, belly, ribs, that, each, had, a, middle, and, an, outer, section, this, arrangement, immobilised, the, entire, trunk, to, become, flippers, the, limbs, had, changed, considerably, the, limbs, were, very, large, each, about, as, long, as, the, trunk, the, forelimbs, and, hindlimbs, strongly, resembled, each, other, the, humerus, in, the, upper, arm, and, the, femur, in, the, upper, leg, had, become, large, flat, bones, expanded, at, their, outer, ends, the, elbow, joints, and, the, knee, joints, were, no, longer, functional, the, lower, arm, and, the, lower, leg, could, not, flex, in, relation, to, the, upper, limb, elements, but, formed, a, flat, continuation, of, them, all, outer, bones, had, become, flat, supporting, elements, of, the, flippers, tightly, connected, to, each, other, and, hardly, able, to, rotate, flex, extend, or, spread, this, was, true, of, the, ulna, radius, metacarpals, and, fingers, as, well, of, the, tibia, fibula, metatarsals, and, toes, furthermore, in, order, to, elongate, the, flippers, the, number, of, phalanges, had, increased, up, to, eighteen, in, a, row, a, phenomenon, called, hyperphalangy, the, flippers, were, not, perfectly, flat, but, had, a, lightly, convexly, curved, top, profile, like, an, airfoil, to, be, able, to, fly, through, the, water, while, plesiosaurs, varied, little, in, the, build, of, the, trunk, and, can, be, called, conservative, in, this, respect, there, were, major, differences, between, the, subgroups, as, regards, the, form, of, the, neck, and, the, skull, plesiosaurs, can, be, divided, into, two, major, morphological, types, that, differ, in, head, and, neck, size, plesiosauromorphs, such, as, cryptoclididae, elasmosauridae, and, plesiosauridae, had, long, necks, and, small, heads, pliosauromorphs, such, as, the, pliosauridae, and, the, rhomaleosauridae, had, shorter, necks, with, a, large, elongated, head, the, neck, length, variations, were, not, caused, by, an, elongation, of, the, individual, cervical, vertebrae, but, an, increase, in, their, number, elasmosaurus, has, seventy, two, neck, vertebrae, the, known, record, is, held, by, the, elasmosaurid, albertonectes, with, seventy, six, cervicals, the, large, number, of, joints, suggested, to, early, researchers, that, the, neck, must, have, been, very, flexible, indeed, a, swan, like, curvature, of, the, neck, was, assumed, to, be, possible, in, icelandic, plesiosaurs, are, even, called, svane, lur, swan, lizards, however, modern, research, has, confirmed, an, earlier, conjecture, of, williston, that, the, long, plate, like, spines, on, top, of, the, vertebrae, the, processus, spinosi, strongly, limited, vertical, neck, movement, although, horizontal, curving, was, less, restricted, in, general, the, neck, must, have, been, rather, stiff, and, certainly, was, incapable, of, being, bent, into, serpentine, coils, this, is, even, more, true, of, the, short, necked, pliosauromophs, which, had, as, few, as, eleven, cervical, vertebrae, with, early, forms, the, amphicoelous, or, amphiplat, neck, vertebrae, bore, double, headed, neck, ribs, later, forms, had, single, headed, ribs, in, the, remainder, of, the, vertebral, column, the, number, of, dorsal, vertebrae, varied, between, about, nineteen, and, thirty, two, of, the, sacral, vertebrae, between, two, and, six, and, of, the, tail, vertebrae, between, about, twenty, one, and, thirty, two, these, vertebrae, still, possessed, the, original, processes, inherited, from, the, land, dwelling, ancestors, of, the, sauropterygia, and, had, not, been, reduced, to, fish, like, simple, discs, as, happened, with, the, vertebrae, of, ichthyosaurs, the, tail, vertebrae, possessed, chevron, bones, the, dorsal, vertebrae, of, plesiosaurs, are, easily, recognisable, by, two, large, foramina, subcentralia, paired, vascular, openings, at, the, underside, the, skull, of, plesiosaurs, showed, the, euryapsid, condition, lacking, the, lower, temporal, fenestrae, the, openings, at, the, lower, rear, sides, the, upper, temporal, fenestrae, formed, large, openings, at, the, sides, of, the, rear, skull, roof, the, attachment, for, muscles, closing, the, lower, jaws, generally, the, parietal, bones, were, very, large, with, a, midline, crest, while, the, squamosal, bones, typically, formed, an, arch, excluding, the, parietals, from, the, occiput, the, eye, sockets, were, large, in, general, pointing, obliquely, upwards, the, pliosaurids, had, more, sideways, directed, eyes, the, eyes, were, supported, by, scleral, rings, the, form, of, which, shows, that, they, were, relatively, flat, an, adaptation, to, diving, the, anteriorly, placed, internal, nostrils, the, choanae, have, palatal, grooves, to, channel, water, the, flow, of, which, would, be, maintained, by, hydrodynamic, pressure, over, the, posteriorly, placed, in, front, of, the, eye, sockets, external, nares, during, swimming, according, to, one, hypothesis, during, its, passage, through, the, nasal, ducts, the, water, would, have, been, smelled, by, olfactory, epithelia, however, more, to, the, rear, a, second, pair, of, openings, is, present, in, the, palate, a, later, hypothesis, holds, that, these, are, the, real, choanae, and, the, front, pair, in, reality, represented, paired, salt, glands, the, distance, between, the, eye, sockets, and, the, nostrils, was, so, limited, because, the, nasal, bones, were, strongly, reduced, even, absent, in, many, species, the, premaxillae, directly, touched, the, frontal, bones, in, the, elasmosaurids, they, even, reached, back, to, the, parietal, bones, often, the, lacrimal, bones, were, also, lacking, the, tooth, form, and, number, was, very, variable, some, forms, had, hundreds, of, needle, like, teeth, most, species, had, larger, conical, teeth, with, a, round, or, oval, cross, section, such, teeth, numbered, four, to, six, in, the, premaxilla, and, about, fourteen, to, twenty, five, in, the, maxilla, the, number, in, the, lower, jaws, roughly, equalled, that, of, the, skull, the, teeth, were, placed, in, tooth, sockets, had, vertically, wrinkled, enamel, and, lacked, a, true, cutting, edge, or, carina, with, some, species, the, front, teeth, were, notably, longer, to, grab, prey, soft, tissue, remains, of, plesiosaurs, are, rare, but, sometimes, especially, in, shale, deposits, they, have, been, partly, preserved, e, g, showing, the, outlines, of, the, body, an, early, discovery, in, this, respect, was, the, holotype, of, plesiosaurus, conybeari, presently, attenborosaurus, from, such, finds, it, is, known, that, the, skin, was, smooth, without, apparent, scales, but, with, small, wrinkles, that, the, trailing, edge, of, the, flippers, extended, considerably, behind, the, limb, bones, and, that, the, tail, bore, a, vertical, fin, as, reported, by, wilhelm, dames, in, his, description, of, plesiosaurus, guilelmiimperatoris, presently, seeleyosaurus, the, possibility, of, a, tail, fluke, has, been, confirmed, by, recent, studies, on, the, caudal, neural, spine, form, of, pantosaurus, cryptoclidus, and, rhomaleosaurus, zetlandicus, a, 2020, study, claims, that, the, caudal, fin, was, horizontal, in, configuration, the, probable, food, source, of, plesiosaurs, varied, depending, on, whether, they, belonged, to, the, long, necked, plesiosauromorph, forms, or, the, short, necked, pliosauromorph, species, the, extremely, long, necks, of, plesiosauromorphs, have, caused, speculation, as, to, their, function, from, the, very, moment, their, special, build, became, apparent, conybeare, had, offered, three, possible, explanations, the, neck, could, have, served, to, intercept, fast, moving, fish, in, a, pursuit, alternatively, plesiosaurs, could, have, rested, on, the, sea, bottom, while, the, head, was, sent, out, to, search, for, prey, which, seemed, to, be, confirmed, by, the, fact, the, eyes, were, directed, relatively, upwards, finally, conybeare, suggested, the, possibility, that, plesiosaurs, swam, on, the, surface, letting, their, necks, plunge, downwards, to, seek, food, at, lower, levels, all, these, interpretations, assumed, that, the, neck, was, very, flexible, the, modern, insight, that, the, neck, was, in, fact, rather, rigid, with, limited, vertical, movement, has, necessitated, new, explanations, one, hypothesis, is, that, the, length, of, the, neck, made, it, possible, to, surprise, schools, of, fish, the, head, arriving, before, the, sight, or, pressure, wave, of, the, trunk, could, alert, them, plesiosauromorphs, hunted, visually, as, shown, by, their, large, eyes, and, perhaps, employed, a, directional, sense, of, olfaction, hard, and, soft, bodied, cephalopods, probably, formed, part, of, their, diet, their, jaws, were, probably, strong, enough, to, bite, through, the, hard, shells, of, this, prey, type, fossil, specimens, have, been, found, with, cephalopod, shells, still, in, their, stomach, the, bony, fish, osteichthyes, which, further, diversified, during, the, jurassic, were, likely, prey, as, well, a, very, different, hypothesis, claims, that, plesiosauromorphs, were, bottom, feeders, the, stiff, necks, would, have, been, used, to, plough, the, sea, bottom, eating, the, benthos, this, would, have, been, proven, by, long, furrows, present, in, ancients, seabeds, such, a, lifestyle, has, in, 2017, been, suggested, for, morturneria, plesiosauromorphs, were, not, well, adapted, to, catching, large, fast, moving, prey, as, their, long, necks, though, seemingly, streamlined, caused, enormous, skin, friction, sankar, chatterjee, suggested, in, 1989, that, some, cryptocleididae, were, suspension, feeders, filtering, plankton, aristonectes, e, g, had, hundreds, of, teeth, allowing, it, to, sieve, small, crustacea, from, the, water, the, short, necked, pliosauromorphs, were, top, carnivores, or, apex, predators, in, their, respective, foodwebs, they, were, pursuit, predators, or, ambush, predators, of, various, sized, prey, and, opportunistic, feeders, their, teeth, could, be, used, to, pierce, soft, bodied, prey, especially, fish, their, heads, and, teeth, were, very, large, suited, to, grab, and, rip, apart, large, animals, their, morphology, allowed, for, a, high, swimming, speed, they, too, hunted, visually, plesiosaurs, were, themselves, prey, for, other, carnivores, as, shown, by, bite, marks, left, by, a, shark, that, have, been, discovered, on, a, fossilized, plesiosaur, fin, and, the, fossilized, remains, of, a, mosasaur, s, stomach, contents, that, are, thought, to, be, the, remains, of, a, plesiosaur, skeletons, have, also, been, discovered, with, gastroliths, stones, in, their, stomachs, though, whether, to, help, break, down, food, especially, cephalopods, in, a, muscular, gizzard, or, to, vary, buoyancy, or, both, has, not, been, established, however, the, total, weight, of, the, gastroliths, found, in, various, specimens, appears, to, be, insufficient, to, modify, the, buoyancy, of, these, large, reptiles, the, first, plesiosaur, gastroliths, found, with, mauisaurus, gardneri, a, nomen, nudum, were, reported, by, harry, govier, seeley, in, 1877, the, number, of, these, stones, per, individual, is, often, very, large, in, 1949, a, fossil, of, alzadasaurus, specimen, sdsm, 451, later, renamed, to, styxosaurus, showed, 253, of, them, the, size, of, individual, stones, is, often, considerable, in, 1991, an, elasmosaurid, specimen, kuvp, 129744, was, investigated, containing, a, gastrolith, with, a, diameter, of, seventeen, centimetres, and, a, weight, of, 1300, grams, and, a, somewhat, shorter, stone, of, 1490, grams, in, total, forty, seven, gastroliths, were, present, with, a, combined, weight, of, 13, kilograms, the, size, of, the, stones, has, been, seen, as, an, indication, that, they, were, not, swallowed, by, accident, but, deliberately, the, animal, perhaps, covering, large, distances, in, search, of, a, suitable, rock, type, the, type, specimen, of, scalamagnus, mna, v10046, is, associated, with, 289, gastroliths, which, is, unusual, in, comparison, to, most, polycotylid, skeletons, that, generally, lack, gastroliths, ranging, from, less, than, 0, 1, grams, to, 18, 5, grams, the, total, mass, of, the, gastroliths, was, about, 518, grams, about, three, quarters, of, the, stones, weighed, less, than, 2, grams, with, the, mean, mass, and, median, mass, of, the, stones, respectively, estimated, at, 1, 9, grams, and, 0, 8, grams, the, gastroliths, had, high, mean, value, and, variability, in, sphericity, suggesting, that, this, individual, was, obtaining, its, stones, from, rivers, located, along, the, western, side, of, the, western, interior, seaway, the, distinctive, four, flippered, body, shape, has, caused, considerable, speculation, about, what, kind, of, stroke, plesiosaurs, used, the, only, modern, group, with, four, flippers, are, the, sea, turtles, which, only, use, the, front, pair, for, propulsion, conybeare, and, buckland, had, already, compared, the, flippers, with, bird, wings, however, such, a, comparison, was, not, very, informative, as, the, mechanics, of, bird, flight, in, this, period, were, poorly, understood, by, the, middle, of, the, nineteenth, century, it, was, typically, assumed, that, plesiosaurs, employed, a, rowing, movement, the, flippers, would, have, been, moved, forward, in, a, horizontal, position, to, minimise, friction, and, then, axially, rotated, to, a, vertical, position, in, order, to, be, pulled, to, the, rear, causing, the, largest, possible, reactive, force, in, fact, such, a, method, would, be, very, inefficient, the, recovery, stroke, in, this, case, generates, no, thrust, and, the, rear, stroke, generates, an, enormous, turbulence, in, the, early, twentieth, century, the, newly, discovered, principles, of, bird, flight, suggested, to, several, researchers, that, plesiosaurs, like, turtles, and, penguins, made, a, flying, movement, while, swimming, this, was, e, g, proposed, by, eberhard, fraas, in, 1905, and, in, 1908, by, othenio, abel, when, flying, the, flipper, movement, is, more, vertical, its, point, describing, an, oval, or, 8, ideally, the, flipper, is, first, moved, obliquely, to, the, front, and, downwards, and, then, after, a, slight, retraction, and, rotation, crosses, this, path, from, below, to, be, pulled, to, the, front, and, upwards, during, both, strokes, down, and, up, according, to, bernoulli, s, principle, forward, and, upward, thrust, is, generated, by, the, convexly, curved, upper, profile, of, the, flipper, the, front, edge, slightly, inclined, relative, to, the, water, flow, while, turbulence, is, minimal, however, despite, the, evident, advantages, of, such, a, swimming, method, in, 1924, the, first, systematic, study, on, the, musculature, of, plesiosaurs, by, david, meredith, seares, watson, concluded, they, nevertheless, performed, a, rowing, movement, during, the, middle, of, the, twentieth, century, watson, s, rowing, model, remained, the, dominant, hypothesis, regarding, the, plesiosaur, swimming, stroke, in, 1957, lambert, beverly, halstead, at, the, time, using, the, family, name, tarlo, proposed, a, variant, the, hindlimbs, would, have, rowed, in, the, horizontal, plane, but, the, forelimbs, would, have, paddled, moved, to, below, and, to, the, rear, in, 1975, the, traditional, model, was, challenged, by, jane, ann, robinson, who, revived, the, flying, hypothesis, she, argued, that, the, main, muscle, groups, were, optimally, placed, for, a, vertical, flipper, movement, not, for, pulling, the, limbs, horizontally, and, that, the, form, of, the, shoulder, and, hip, joints, would, have, precluded, the, vertical, rotation, needed, for, rowing, in, a, subsequent, article, robinson, proposed, that, the, kinetic, energy, generated, by, the, forces, exerted, on, the, trunk, by, the, strokes, would, have, been, stored, and, released, as, elastic, energy, in, the, ribcage, allowing, for, an, especially, efficient, and, dynamic, propulsion, system, in, robinson, s, model, both, the, downstroke, and, the, upstroke, would, have, been, powerful, in, 1982, she, was, criticised, by, samuel, tarsitano, eberhard, frey, and, j, rgen, riess, who, claimed, that, while, the, muscles, at, the, underside, of, the, shoulder, and, pelvic, plates, were, clearly, powerful, enough, to, pull, the, limbs, downwards, comparable, muscle, groups, on, the, top, of, these, plates, to, elevate, the, limbs, were, simply, lacking, and, had, they, been, present, could, not, have, been, forcefully, employed, their, bulging, carrying, the, danger, of, hurting, the, internal, organs, they, proposed, a, more, limited, flying, model, in, which, a, powerful, downstroke, was, combined, with, a, largely, unpowered, recovery, the, flipper, returning, to, its, original, position, by, the, momentum, of, the, forward, moving, and, temporarily, sinking, body, this, modified, flying, model, became, a, popular, interpretation, less, attention, was, given, to, an, alternative, hypothesis, by, stephen, godfrey, in, 1984, which, proposed, that, both, the, forelimbs, and, hindlimbs, performed, a, deep, paddling, motion, to, the, rear, combined, with, a, powered, recovery, stroke, to, the, front, resembling, the, movement, made, by, the, forelimbs, of, sea, lions, in, 2010, frank, sanders, and, kenneth, carpenter, published, a, study, concluding, that, robinson, s, model, had, been, correct, frey, riess, would, have, been, mistaken, in, their, assertion, that, the, shoulder, and, pelvic, plates, had, no, muscles, attached, to, their, upper, sides, while, these, muscle, groups, were, probably, not, very, powerful, this, could, easily, have, been, compensated, by, the, large, muscles, on, the, back, especially, the, latissimus, dorsi, which, would, have, been, well, developed, in, view, of, the, high, spines, on, the, backbone, furthermore, the, flat, build, of, the, shoulder, and, hip, joints, strongly, indicated, that, the, main, movement, was, vertical, not, horizontal, like, all, tetrapods, with, limbs, plesiosaurs, must, have, had, a, certain, gait, a, coordinated, movement, pattern, of, the, in, this, case, flippers, of, all, the, possibilities, in, practice, attention, has, been, largely, directed, to, the, question, of, whether, the, front, pair, and, hind, pair, moved, simultaneously, so, that, all, four, flippers, were, engaged, at, the, same, moment, or, in, an, alternate, pattern, each, pair, being, employed, in, turn, frey, riess, in, 1991, proposed, an, alternate, model, which, would, have, had, the, advantage, of, a, more, continuous, propulsion, in, 2000, theagarten, lingham, soliar, evaded, the, question, by, concluding, that, like, sea, turtles, plesiosaurs, only, used, the, front, pair, for, a, powered, stroke, the, hind, pair, would, have, been, merely, used, for, steering, lingham, soliar, deduced, this, from, the, form, of, the, hip, joint, which, would, have, allowed, for, only, a, limited, vertical, movement, furthermore, a, separation, of, the, propulsion, and, steering, function, would, have, facilitated, the, general, coordination, of, the, body, and, prevented, a, too, extreme, pitch, he, rejected, robinson, s, hypothesis, that, elastic, energy, was, stored, in, the, ribcage, considering, the, ribs, too, stiff, for, this, the, interpretation, by, frey, riess, became, the, dominant, one, but, was, challenged, in, 2004, by, sanders, who, showed, experimentally, that, whereas, an, alternate, movement, might, have, caused, excessive, pitching, a, simultaneous, movement, would, have, caused, only, a, slight, pitch, which, could, have, been, easily, controlled, by, the, hind, flippers, of, the, other, axial, movements, rolling, could, have, been, controlled, by, alternately, engaging, the, flippers, of, the, right, or, left, side, and, yaw, by, the, long, neck, or, a, vertical, tail, fin, sanders, did, not, believe, that, the, hind, pair, was, not, used, for, propulsion, concluding, that, the, limitations, imposed, by, the, hip, joint, were, very, relative, in, 2010, sanders, carpenter, concluded, that, with, an, alternating, gait, the, turbulence, caused, by, the, front, pair, would, have, hindered, an, effective, action, of, the, hind, pair, besides, a, long, gliding, phase, after, a, simultaneous, engagement, would, have, been, very, energy, efficient, it, is, also, possible, that, the, gait, was, optional, and, was, adapted, to, the, circumstances, during, a, fast, steady, pursuit, an, alternate, movement, would, have, been, useful, in, an, ambush, a, simultaneous, stroke, would, have, made, a, peak, speed, possible, when, searching, for, prey, over, a, longer, distance, a, combination, of, a, simultaneous, movement, with, gliding, would, have, cost, the, least, energy, in, 2017, a, study, by, luke, muscutt, using, a, robot, model, concluded, that, the, rear, flippers, were, actively, employed, allowing, for, a, 60, increase, of, the, propulsive, force, and, a, 40, increase, of, efficiency, there, would, not, have, been, a, single, optimal, phase, for, all, conditions, the, gait, likely, having, been, changed, as, the, situation, demanded, in, general, it, is, hard, to, determine, the, maximum, speed, of, extinct, sea, creatures, for, plesiosaurs, this, is, made, more, difficult, by, the, lack, of, consensus, about, their, flipper, stroke, and, gait, there, are, no, exact, calculations, of, their, reynolds, number, fossil, impressions, show, that, the, skin, was, relatively, smooth, not, scaled, and, this, may, have, reduced, form, drag, small, wrinkles, are, present, in, the, skin, that, may, have, prevented, separation, of, the, laminar, flow, in, the, boundary, layer, and, thereby, reduced, skin, friction, sustained, speed, may, be, estimated, by, calculating, the, drag, of, a, simplified, model, of, the, body, that, can, be, approached, by, a, prolate, spheroid, and, the, sustainable, level, of, energy, output, by, the, muscles, a, first, study, of, this, problem, was, published, by, judy, massare, in, 1988, even, when, assuming, a, low, hydrodynamic, efficiency, of, 0, 65, massare, s, model, seemed, to, indicate, that, plesiosaurs, if, warm, blooded, would, have, cruised, at, a, speed, of, four, metres, per, second, or, about, fourteen, kilometres, per, hour, considerably, exceeding, the, known, speeds, of, extant, dolphins, and, whales, however, in, 2002, ryosuke, motani, showed, that, the, formulae, that, massare, had, used, had, been, flawed, a, recalculation, using, corrected, formulae, resulted, in, a, speed, of, half, a, metre, per, second, 1, 8, km, h, for, a, cold, blooded, plesiosaur, and, one, and, a, half, metres, per, second, 5, 4, km, h, for, an, endothermic, plesiosaur, even, the, highest, estimate, is, about, a, third, lower, than, the, speed, of, extant, cetacea, massare, also, tried, to, compare, the, speeds, of, plesiosaurs, with, those, of, the, two, other, main, sea, reptile, groups, the, ichthyosauria, and, the, mosasauridae, she, concluded, that, plesiosaurs, were, about, twenty, percent, slower, than, advanced, ichthyosaurs, which, employed, a, very, effective, tunniform, movement, oscillating, just, the, tail, but, five, percent, faster, than, mosasaurids, which, were, assumed, to, swim, with, an, inefficient, anguilliform, eel, like, movement, of, the, body, the, many, plesiosaur, species, may, have, differed, considerably, in, their, swimming, speeds, reflecting, the, various, body, shapes, present, in, the, group, while, the, short, necked, pliosauromorphs, e, g, liopleurodon, may, have, been, fast, swimmers, the, long, necked, plesiosauromorphs, were, built, more, for, manoeuvrability, than, for, speed, slowed, by, a, strong, skin, friction, yet, capable, of, a, fast, rolling, movement, some, long, necked, forms, such, as, the, elasmosauridae, also, have, relatively, short, stubby, flippers, with, a, low, aspect, ratio, further, reducing, speed, but, improving, roll, few, data, are, available, that, show, exactly, how, deep, plesiosaurs, dived, that, they, dived, to, some, considerable, depth, is, proven, by, traces, of, decompression, sickness, the, heads, of, the, humeri, and, femora, with, many, fossils, show, necrosis, of, the, bone, tissue, caused, by, a, too, rapid, ascent, after, deep, diving, however, this, does, not, allow, to, deduce, some, exact, depth, as, the, damage, could, have, been, caused, by, a, few, very, deep, dives, or, alternatively, by, a, great, number, of, relatively, shallow, descents, the, vertebrae, show, no, such, damage, they, were, probably, protected, by, a, superior, blood, supply, made, possible, by, the, arteries, entering, the, bone, through, the, two, foramina, subcentralia, large, openings, in, their, undersides, descending, would, have, been, helped, by, a, negative, archimedes, force, i, e, being, denser, than, water, of, course, this, would, have, had, the, disadvantage, of, hampering, coming, up, again, young, plesiosaurs, show, pachyostosis, an, extreme, density, of, the, bone, tissue, which, might, have, increased, relative, weight, adult, individuals, have, more, spongy, bone, gastroliths, have, been, suggested, as, a, method, to, increase, weight, or, even, as, means, to, attain, neutral, buoyancy, swallowing, or, spitting, them, out, again, as, needed, they, might, also, have, been, used, to, increase, stability, the, relatively, large, eyes, of, the, cryptocleididae, have, been, seen, as, an, adaptation, to, deep, diving, a, 2020, study, has, posited, that, sauropterygians, relied, on, vertical, tail, strokes, much, like, cetaceans, in, plesiosaurs, the, trunk, was, rigid, so, this, action, was, more, limited, and, in, conjunction, with, the, flippers, traditionally, it, was, assumed, that, extinct, reptile, groups, were, cold, blooded, like, modern, reptiles, new, research, during, the, past, decades, has, led, to, the, conclusion, that, some, groups, such, as, theropod, dinosaurs, and, pterosaurs, were, very, likely, warm, blooded, whether, perhaps, plesiosaurs, were, warm, blooded, as, well, is, difficult, to, determine, one, of, the, indications, of, a, high, metabolism, is, the, presence, of, fast, growing, fibrolamellar, bone, the, pachyostosis, with, juvenile, individuals, makes, it, hard, to, establish, whether, plesiosaurs, possessed, such, bone, though, however, it, has, been, possible, to, check, its, occurrence, with, more, basal, members, of, the, more, inclusive, group, that, plesiosaurs, belonged, to, the, sauropterygia, a, study, in, 2010, concluded, that, fibrolamellar, bone, was, originally, present, with, sauropterygians, a, subsequent, publication, in, 2013, found, that, the, nothosauridae, lacked, this, bone, matrix, type, but, that, basal, pistosauria, possessed, it, a, sign, of, a, more, elevated, metabolism, it, is, thus, more, parsimonious, to, assume, that, the, more, derived, pistosaurians, the, plesiosaurs, also, had, a, faster, metabolism, a, paper, published, in, 2018, claimed, that, plesiosaurs, had, resting, metabolic, rates, rmr, in, the, range, of, birds, based, on, quantitative, osteohistological, modelling, however, these, results, are, problematic, in, view, of, general, principles, of, vertebrate, physiology, see, kleiber, s, law, evidence, from, isotope, studies, of, plesiosaur, tooth, enamel, indeed, suggests, endothermy, at, lower, rmrs, with, inferred, body, temperatures, of, ca, 26, c, 79, f, as, reptiles, in, general, are, oviparous, until, the, end, of, the, twentieth, century, it, had, been, seen, as, possible, that, smaller, plesiosaurs, may, have, crawled, up, on, a, beach, to, lay, eggs, like, modern, turtles, their, strong, limbs, and, a, flat, underside, seemed, to, have, made, this, feasible, this, method, was, for, example, defended, by, halstead, however, as, those, limbs, no, longer, had, functional, elbow, or, knee, joints, and, the, underside, by, its, very, flatness, would, have, generated, a, lot, of, friction, already, in, the, nineteenth, century, it, was, hypothesised, that, plesiosaurs, had, been, viviparous, besides, it, was, hard, to, conceive, how, the, largest, species, as, big, as, whales, could, have, survived, a, beaching, fossil, finds, of, ichthyosaur, embryos, showed, that, at, least, one, group, of, marine, reptiles, had, borne, live, young, the, first, to, claim, that, similar, embryos, had, been, found, in, plesiosaurs, was, harry, govier, seeley, who, reported, in, 1887, having, acquired, a, nodule, with, four, to, eight, tiny, skeletons, in, 1896, he, described, this, discovery, in, more, detail, if, authentic, the, embryos, of, plesiosaurs, would, have, been, very, small, like, those, of, ichthyosaurs, however, in, 1982, richard, anthony, thulborn, showed, that, seeley, had, been, deceived, by, a, doctored, fossil, of, a, nest, of, crayfish, an, actual, plesiosaur, specimen, found, in, 1987, eventually, proved, that, plesiosaurs, gave, birth, to, live, young, this, fossil, of, a, pregnant, polycotylus, latippinus, shows, that, these, animals, gave, birth, to, a, single, large, juvenile, and, probably, invested, parental, care, in, their, offspring, similar, to, modern, whales, the, young, was, 1, 5, metres, five, feet, long, and, thus, large, compared, to, its, mother, of, five, metres, sixteen, feet, length, indicating, a, k, strategy, in, reproduction, little, is, known, about, growth, rates, or, a, possible, sexual, dimorphism, from, the, parental, care, indicated, by, the, large, size, of, the, young, it, can, be, deduced, that, social, behaviour, in, general, was, relatively, complex, it, is, not, known, whether, plesiosaurs, hunted, in, packs, their, relative, brain, size, seems, to, be, typical, for, reptiles, of, the, senses, sight, and, smell, were, important, hearing, less, so, elasmosaurids, have, lost, the, stapes, completely, it, has, been, suggested, that, with, some, groups, the, skull, housed, electro, sensitive, organs, some, plesiosaur, fossils, show, pathologies, the, result, of, illness, or, old, age, in, 2012, a, mandible, of, pliosaurus, was, described, with, a, jaw, joint, clearly, afflicted, by, arthritis, a, typical, sign, of, senescence, plesiosaur, fossils, have, been, found, on, every, continent, including, antarctica, the, following, is, a, list, of, geologic, formations, that, have, produced, plesiosaur, fossils, france, the, belief, that, plesiosaurs, are, dinosaurs, is, a, common, misconception, and, plesiosaurs, are, often, erroneously, depicted, as, dinosaurs, in, popular, culture, it, has, been, suggested, that, legends, of, sea, serpents, and, modern, sightings, of, supposed, monsters, in, lakes, or, the, sea, could, be, explained, by, the, survival, of, plesiosaurs, into, modern, times, this, cryptozoological, proposal, has, been, rejected, by, the, scientific, community, at, large, which, considers, it, to, be, based, on, fantasy, and, pseudoscience, purported, plesiosaur, carcasses, have, been, shown, to, be, partially, decomposed, corpses, of, basking, sharks, instead, while, the, loch, ness, monster, is, often, reported, as, looking, like, a, plesiosaur, it, is, also, often, described, as, looking, completely, different, a, number, of, reasons, have, been, presented, for, it, to, be, unlikely, to, be, a, plesiosaur, they, include, the, assumption, that, the, water, in, the, loch, is, too, cold, for, a, presumed, cold, blooded, reptile, to, be, able, to, survive, easily, the, fact, that, the, osteology, of, the, plesiosaur, s, neck, makes, it, absolutely, safe, to, say, that, the, plesiosaur, could, not, lift, its, head, like, a, swan, out, of, water, as, the, loch, ness, monster, does, the, assumption, that, air, breathing, animals, would, be, easy, to, see, whenever, they, appear, at, the, surface, to, breathe, the, fact, that, the, loch, is, too, small, and, contains, insufficient, food, to, be, able, to, support, a, breeding, colony, of, large, animals, and, finally, the, fact, that, the, lake, was, formed, only, 10, 000, years, ago, at, the, end, of, the, last, ice, age, and, the, latest, fossil, appearance, of, plesiosaurs, dates, to, over, 66, million, years, ago, frequent, explanations, for, the, sightings, include, waves, floating, inanimate, objects, tricks, of, the, light, swimming, known, animals, and, practical, jokes, nevertheless, in, the, popular, imagination, plesiosaurs, have, come, to, be, identified, with, the, monster, of, loch, ness, this, has, made, plesiosaurs, better, known, to, the, general, public
