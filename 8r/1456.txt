prostate, cancer, is, the, uncontrolled, growth, of, cells, in, the, prostate, a, gland, in, the, male, reproductive, system, below, the, bladder, abnormal, growth, of, prostate, tissue, is, usually, detected, through, screening, tests, typically, blood, tests, that, check, for, prostate, specific, antigen, psa, levels, those, with, high, levels, of, psa, in, their, blood, are, at, increased, risk, for, developing, prostate, cancer, diagnosis, requires, a, biopsy, of, the, prostate, if, cancer, is, present, the, pathologist, assigns, a, gleason, score, and, a, higher, score, represents, a, more, dangerous, tumor, medical, imaging, is, performed, to, look, for, cancer, that, has, spread, outside, the, prostate, based, on, the, gleason, score, psa, levels, and, imaging, results, a, cancer, case, is, assigned, a, stage, 1, to, 4, a, higher, stage, signifies, a, more, advanced, more, dangerous, disease, most, prostate, tumors, remain, small, and, cause, no, health, problems, these, are, managed, with, active, surveillance, monitoring, the, tumor, with, regular, tests, to, ensure, it, has, not, grown, tumors, more, likely, to, be, dangerous, can, be, destroyed, with, radiation, therapy, or, surgically, removed, by, radical, prostatectomy, those, whose, cancer, spreads, beyond, the, prostate, are, treated, with, hormone, therapy, which, reduces, levels, of, the, androgens, male, sex, hormones, that, prostate, cells, need, to, survive, eventually, cancer, cells, can, grow, resistant, to, this, treatment, this, most, advanced, stage, of, the, disease, called, castration, resistant, prostate, cancer, is, treated, with, continued, hormone, therapy, alongside, the, chemotherapy, drug, docetaxel, some, tumors, metastasize, spread, to, other, areas, of, the, body, particularly, the, bones, and, lymph, nodes, there, tumors, cause, severe, bone, pain, leg, weakness, or, paralysis, and, eventually, death, prostate, cancer, prognosis, depends, on, how, far, the, cancer, has, spread, at, diagnosis, most, men, diagnosed, have, tumors, confined, to, the, prostate, 99, of, them, survive, more, than, 10, years, from, their, diagnoses, tumors, that, have, metastasized, to, distant, body, sites, are, most, dangerous, with, five, year, survival, rates, of, 30, 40, the, risk, of, developing, prostate, cancer, increases, with, age, the, average, age, of, diagnosis, is, 67, those, with, a, family, history, of, any, cancer, are, more, likely, to, have, prostate, cancer, particularly, those, who, inherit, cancer, associated, variants, of, the, brca2, gene, each, year, 1, 2, million, cases, of, prostate, cancer, are, diagnosed, and, 350, 000, die, of, the, disease, making, it, the, second, leading, cause, of, cancer, and, cancer, death, in, men, one, in, eight, men, is, diagnosed, with, prostate, cancer, in, his, lifetime, and, one, in, forty, dies, of, the, disease, prostate, tumors, were, first, described, in, the, mid, 19th, century, during, surgeries, on, men, with, urinary, obstructions, initially, prostatectomy, was, the, primary, treatment, for, prostate, cancer, by, the, mid, 20th, century, radiation, treatments, and, hormone, therapies, were, developed, to, improve, prostate, cancer, treatment, the, invention, of, hormone, therapies, for, prostate, cancer, was, recognized, with, the, 1966, nobel, prize, to, charles, b, huggins, and, the, 1977, prize, to, andrzej, w, schally, early, prostate, cancer, usually, causes, no, symptoms, as, the, cancer, advances, it, may, cause, erectile, dysfunction, blood, in, the, urine, or, semen, or, trouble, urinating, commonly, including, frequent, urination, and, slow, or, weak, urine, stream, more, than, half, of, men, over, age, 50, experience, some, form, of, urination, problem, typically, due, to, issues, other, than, prostate, cancer, such, as, benign, prostatic, hyperplasia, non, cancerous, enlargement, of, the, prostate, advanced, prostate, tumors, can, metastasize, to, nearby, lymph, nodes, and, bones, particularly, in, the, pelvis, hips, spine, ribs, head, and, neck, there, they, can, cause, fatigue, unexplained, weight, loss, and, back, or, bone, pain, that, does, not, improve, with, rest, metastases, can, damage, the, bones, around, them, and, around, a, quarter, of, those, with, metastatic, prostate, cancer, develop, a, bone, fracture, growing, metastases, can, also, compress, the, spinal, cord, causing, weakness, in, the, legs, and, feet, or, limb, paralysis, most, cases, of, prostate, cancer, are, diagnosed, through, screening, tests, when, tumors, are, too, small, to, cause, any, symptoms, this, is, done, through, blood, tests, to, measure, levels, of, the, protein, prostate, specific, antigen, psa, which, are, elevated, in, those, with, enlarged, prostates, whether, due, to, prostate, cancer, or, benign, prostatic, hyperplasia, the, typical, man, s, blood, has, around, 1, nanogram, ng, of, psa, per, milliliter, ml, of, blood, tested, those, with, psa, levels, below, average, are, very, unlikely, to, develop, dangerous, prostate, cancer, over, the, next, 8, to, 10, years, men, with, psa, levels, above, 4, ng, ml, are, at, increased, risk, around, 1, in, 4, will, develop, prostate, cancer, and, are, often, referred, for, a, prostate, biopsy, psa, levels, over, 10, ng, ml, indicate, an, even, higher, risk, over, half, of, men, in, this, group, develop, prostate, cancer, men, with, high, psa, levels, are, often, recommended, to, repeat, the, blood, test, four, to, six, weeks, later, as, psa, levels, can, fluctuate, unrelated, to, prostate, cancer, benign, prostatic, hyperplasia, prostate, infection, recent, ejaculation, and, some, urological, procedures, can, increase, psa, levels, taking, 5, reductase, inhibitors, can, decrease, psa, levels, those, with, elevated, psa, may, undergo, secondary, screening, blood, tests, that, measure, subtypes, of, psa, and, other, molecules, to, better, predict, the, likelihood, that, a, person, will, develop, aggressive, prostate, cancer, many, measure, free, psa, the, fraction, of, psa, unbound, to, other, blood, proteins, usually, around, 10, to, 30, men, who, have, a, lower, percentage, of, free, psa, are, more, likely, to, have, prostate, cancer, several, common, tests, more, accurately, detect, prostate, cancer, cases, by, also, measuring, subtypes, of, free, psa, including, the, prostate, health, index, measures, a, fragment, called, 2propsa, and, 4k, score, measures, intact, free, psa, other, tests, measure, blood, levels, of, additional, prostate, related, proteins, such, as, kallikrein, 2, also, measured, by, 4k, score, or, urine, levels, of, mrna, molecules, common, to, prostate, tumors, like, pca3, and, tmprss2, fused, to, erg, several, large, studies, have, found, that, men, screened, for, prostate, cancer, have, a, reduced, risk, of, dying, from, the, disease, however, detection, of, cancer, cases, that, would, not, have, otherwise, impacted, health, can, cause, anxiety, and, lead, to, unneeded, biopsies, and, treatments, both, of, which, can, cause, unwanted, complications, major, national, health, organizations, offer, differing, recommendations, attempting, to, balance, the, benefits, of, early, diagnosis, with, the, potential, harms, of, treating, people, whose, tumors, are, unlikely, to, impact, health, most, medical, guidelines, recommend, that, men, at, high, risk, of, prostate, cancer, due, to, age, family, history, ethnicity, or, prior, evidence, of, high, blood, psa, levels, be, counseled, on, the, risks, and, benefits, of, psa, testing, and, be, offered, access, to, screening, tests, medical, guidelines, generally, recommend, against, screening, for, men, over, age, 70, or, with, a, life, expectancy, of, less, than, 10, years, as, a, newly, diagnosed, prostate, cancer, is, unlikely, to, impact, their, natural, lifespan, uptake, of, screening, varies, by, geography, more, than, 80, of, men, are, screened, in, the, us, and, western, europe, 20, of, men, in, japan, and, screening, is, rare, in, regions, with, a, low, human, development, index, men, suspected, of, having, prostate, cancer, may, undergo, several, tests, to, assess, the, prostate, one, common, procedure, is, the, digital, rectal, examination, in, which, a, doctor, inserts, a, lubricated, finger, into, the, rectum, to, feel, the, nearby, prostate, tumors, feel, like, stiff, irregularly, shaped, lumps, against, the, rest, of, the, prostate, hardening, of, the, prostate, can, also, be, due, to, benign, prostatic, hyperplasia, around, 20, 25, of, those, with, abnormal, findings, on, their, rectal, exams, have, prostate, cancer, several, urological, societies, guidelines, recommend, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, to, evaluate, the, prostate, for, potential, tumors, in, men, with, high, psa, levels, mri, results, can, help, distinguish, those, who, have, potentially, dangerous, tumors, from, those, who, do, not, a, definitive, diagnosis, of, prostate, cancer, requires, a, biopsy, of, the, prostate, prostate, biopsies, are, typically, taken, by, a, needle, passing, through, the, rectum, or, perineum, guided, by, transrectal, ultrasonography, mri, or, a, combination, of, the, two, ten, to, twelve, samples, are, taken, from, several, regions, of, the, prostate, to, improve, the, chances, of, finding, any, tumors, biopsies, are, sent, for, a, histopathologic, diagnosis, of, prostate, cancer, wherein, they, are, examined, under, a, microscope, by, a, pathologist, who, determines, the, type, and, extent, of, cancerous, cells, present, cancers, are, first, classified, based, on, their, appearance, under, a, microscope, over, 95, of, prostate, cancers, are, classified, as, adenocarcinomas, resembling, gland, tissue, with, the, rest, largely, squamous, cell, carcinoma, resembling, squamous, cells, a, type, of, epithelial, cell, and, transitional, cell, carcinoma, resembling, transitional, cells, next, tumor, samples, are, graded, based, on, how, much, the, tumor, tissue, differs, from, normal, prostate, tissue, the, more, different, the, tumor, appears, the, faster, the, tumor, is, likely, to, grow, the, gleason, grading, system, is, commonly, used, where, the, pathologist, assigns, numbers, ranging, from, 3, most, similar, to, healthy, prostate, tissue, to, 5, least, similar, to, different, regions, of, the, biopsied, tissue, they, then, calculate, a, gleason, score, by, adding, the, two, numbers, that, represent, the, largest, areas, of, the, biopsy, sample, the, lowest, possible, gleason, score, of, 6, represents, a, biopsy, most, similar, to, healthy, prostate, the, highest, gleason, score, of, 10, represents, the, most, severely, cancerous, gleason, scores, are, commonly, grouped, into, gleason, grade, groups, which, predict, disease, prognosis, a, gleason, score, of, 6, is, gleason, grade, group, 1, best, prognosis, a, score, of, 7, with, gleason, scores, 4, 3, or, gleason, scores, 3, 4, with, the, most, prominent, listed, first, can, be, grade, group, 2, or, 3, it, is, grade, group, 2, if, the, less, severe, gleason, score, 3, covered, more, area, grade, group, 3, if, the, more, severe, gleason, score, 4, covered, more, area, a, score, of, 8, is, grade, group, 4, a, score, of, 9, or, 10, is, grade, group, 5, worst, prognosis, the, extent, of, cancer, spread, is, assessed, by, mri, or, psma, scan, a, positron, emission, tomography, pet, imaging, technique, where, a, radioactive, label, that, binds, the, prostate, protein, prostate, specific, membrane, antigen, is, used, to, detect, metastases, distant, from, the, prostate, ct, scans, may, also, be, used, but, are, less, able, to, detect, spread, outside, the, prostate, than, mri, bone, scintigraphy, is, used, to, test, for, spread, of, cancer, to, bones, after, diagnosis, the, tumor, is, staged, to, determine, the, extent, of, its, growth, and, spread, prostate, cancer, is, typically, staged, using, the, american, joint, committee, on, cancer, s, ajcc, three, component, tnm, system, with, scores, assigned, for, the, extent, of, the, tumor, t, spread, to, any, lymph, nodes, n, and, the, presence, of, metastases, m, scores, of, t1, and, t2, represent, tumors, that, remain, within, the, prostate, t1, is, for, tumors, not, detectable, by, imaging, or, digital, rectal, exam, t2, is, for, tumors, detectable, by, imaging, or, rectal, exam, but, still, confined, within, the, prostate, t3, is, for, tumors, that, grow, beyond, the, prostate, t3a, for, tumors, with, any, extension, outside, the, prostate, t3b, for, tumors, that, invade, the, adjacent, seminal, vesicles, t4, is, for, tumors, that, have, grown, into, organs, beyond, the, seminal, vesicles, the, n, and, m, scores, are, binary, yes, or, no, n1, represents, any, spread, to, the, nearby, lymph, nodes, m1, represents, any, metastases, to, other, body, sites, the, ajcc, then, combines, the, tnm, scores, gleason, grade, group, and, results, of, the, psa, blood, test, to, categorize, cancer, cases, into, one, of, four, stages, and, their, subdivisions, cancer, cases, with, localized, tumors, t1, or, t2, no, spread, n0, and, m0, gleason, grade, group, 1, and, psa, less, than, 10, ng, ml, are, designated, stage, i, those, with, localized, tumors, and, psa, between, 10, and, 20, ng, ml, are, designated, stage, ii, subdivided, into, iia, for, gleason, grade, group, 1, iib, for, grade, group, 2, and, iic, for, grade, group, 3, or, 4, stage, iii, is, the, designation, for, any, of, three, higher, risk, factors, iiia, is, for, a, psa, level, about, 20, ng, ml, iiib, is, for, t3, or, t4, tumors, iiic, is, for, a, gleason, grade, group, of, 5, stage, iv, is, for, cancers, that, have, spread, to, lymph, nodes, n1, stage, iva, or, other, organs, m1, stage, ivb, the, united, kingdom, national, institute, for, health, and, care, excellence, recommends, a, five, stage, system, based, on, disease, prognosis, called, the, cambridge, prognostic, group, with, prognostic, groups, cpg, 1, to, cpg, 5, cpg, 1, is, the, same, as, ajcc, stage, i, cases, with, localized, tumors, t1, or, t2, and, either, gleason, grade, group, 2, or, higher, psa, levels, 10, to, 20, ng, ml, are, designated, cpg, 2, cpg, 3, represents, either, gleason, grade, group, 3, or, the, combination, of, the, cpg, 2, criteria, cpg, 4, is, similar, to, ajcc, stage, 3, any, of, gleason, grade, group, 4, psa, levels, above, 20, ng, ml, or, a, tumor, that, has, grown, beyond, the, prostate, t3, cpg, 5, is, for, the, highest, risk, cases, either, a, t4, tumor, gleason, grade, group, 5, or, any, two, of, the, cpg, 4, criteria, no, drug, or, vaccine, is, approved, by, regulatory, agencies, for, the, prevention, of, prostate, cancer, several, studies, have, shown, 5, reductase, inhibitors, to, reduce, the, total, incidence, of, prostate, cancer, however, it, is, unclear, as, of, 2022, whether, they, reduce, any, cases, of, dangerous, disease, treatment, of, prostate, cancer, varies, based, on, how, advanced, the, cancer, is, the, risk, it, may, spread, and, the, affected, person, s, health, and, personal, preferences, those, with, localized, disease, at, low, risk, for, spread, are, often, more, likely, to, be, harmed, by, the, side, effects, of, treatment, than, the, disease, itself, and, so, are, regularly, tested, for, a, worsening, of, their, disease, those, at, higher, risk, may, receive, treatment, to, eliminate, the, tumor, typically, prostatectomy, surgery, to, remove, the, prostate, or, radiation, therapy, sometimes, alongside, hormone, therapy, those, with, metastatic, disease, are, treated, with, chemotherapy, as, well, as, radiation, or, other, agents, to, alleviate, the, symptoms, of, metastatic, tumors, blood, psa, levels, are, monitored, every, few, months, to, assess, the, effectiveness, of, treatments, and, whether, the, disease, is, recurring, or, advancing, men, diagnosed, with, low, risk, cases, of, prostate, cancer, often, defer, treatment, and, are, monitored, regularly, for, cancer, progression, by, active, surveillance, which, involves, testing, for, tumor, growth, at, fixed, intervals, by, psa, tests, around, every, six, months, digital, rectal, exam, annually, and, mri, or, repeat, biopsies, every, one, to, three, years, this, program, continues, until, increases, in, psa, levels, gleason, grade, or, tumor, size, indicate, a, higher, risk, tumor, that, may, require, intervention, at, least, half, of, men, remain, on, active, surveillance, never, requiring, more, direct, treatment, for, their, prostate, tumors, those, who, elect, to, have, therapy, receive, radiation, therapy, or, a, prostatectomy, these, have, similar, rates, of, cancer, control, but, different, side, effects, radiation, can, be, delivered, by, intensity, modulated, radiation, therapy, imrt, which, allows, for, high, doses, greater, than, 80, gy, to, be, delivered, to, the, prostate, with, relatively, little, radiation, to, other, organs, or, by, brachytherapy, where, a, radioactive, source, is, surgically, inserted, into, the, prostate, imrt, is, given, over, several, sessions, with, treatments, repeated, five, days, per, week, for, several, weeks, brachytherapy, is, typically, performed, in, a, single, session, with, the, radioactive, source, permanently, implanted, into, the, prostate, where, it, expends, its, radioactivity, within, the, next, few, months, with, either, technique, radiation, damage, to, nearby, organs, can, increase, the, risk, of, subsequent, bladder, cancer, and, cause, erectile, dysfunction, infertility, and, radiation, proctitis, damage, to, the, rectum, that, can, cause, diarrhea, bloody, stools, fecal, incontinence, and, pain, radical, prostatectomy, aims, to, surgically, remove, the, cancerous, part, of, the, prostate, along, with, the, seminal, vesicles, and, the, end, of, the, vas, deferens, the, duct, that, delivers, sperm, from, the, testes, in, wealthier, countries, this, is, typically, done, by, robot, assisted, surgery, where, robotic, tools, inserted, through, small, holes, in, the, abdomen, allow, a, surgeon, to, make, small, and, exact, movements, during, surgery, this, method, results, in, shorter, hospital, stays, less, blood, loss, and, fewer, complications, than, traditional, open, surgery, in, places, where, robot, assisted, surgery, is, unavailable, prostatectomy, can, be, performed, laparoscopically, using, a, camera, and, hand, tools, through, small, holes, in, the, abdomen, or, through, traditional, open, surgery, with, an, incision, above, the, penis, retropubic, approach, or, below, the, scrotum, perineal, approach, the, four, approaches, result, in, similar, rates, of, cancer, control, damage, to, nearby, tissue, during, surgery, can, result, in, erectile, dysfunction, and, urinary, incontinence, erectile, dysfunction, is, more, likely, in, those, who, are, older, or, had, previous, erectile, issues, incontinence, is, more, common, in, those, who, are, older, and, have, shorter, urethras, both, for, cancer, progression, outcomes, and, surgical, side, effects, the, skill, and, experience, of, the, individual, surgeon, doing, the, procedure, are, among, the, greatest, determinants, of, success, after, prostatectomy, psa, levels, drop, rapidly, reaching, very, low, or, undetectable, levels, within, two, months, radiotherapy, also, substantially, reduces, psa, levels, but, more, slowly, and, less, completely, with, psa, levels, reaching, their, nadir, two, years, after, radiotherapy, after, either, treatment, psa, levels, are, monitored, regularly, up, to, half, of, those, treated, will, eventually, have, a, rise, in, psa, levels, suggesting, the, tumor, or, small, metastases, are, growing, again, people, with, high, or, rising, psa, levels, are, often, offered, another, round, of, radiation, therapy, directed, at, the, former, tumor, site, this, reduces, risk, for, further, progression, by, 75, those, suspected, of, metastases, can, undergo, pet, scanning, with, sensitive, radiotracers, c, 11, choline, f, 18, fluciclovine, and, f, 18, or, ga, 68, attached, to, a, psma, targeting, drug, each, of, which, is, able, to, detect, small, metastases, more, sensitively, than, alternative, imaging, methods, for, those, with, metastatic, disease, the, standard, of, care, is, androgen, deprivation, therapy, also, called, chemical, castration, drugs, that, reduce, levels, of, androgens, male, sex, hormones, that, prostate, cells, require, to, grow, various, drugs, are, used, to, lower, androgen, levels, by, blocking, the, synthesis, or, action, of, testosterone, the, primary, androgen, the, first, line, of, treatment, typically, involves, gnrh, agonists, like, leuprolide, goserelin, or, triptorelin, by, injection, monthly, or, less, frequently, as, needed, gnrh, agonists, cause, a, brief, rise, in, testosterone, levels, at, treatment, initiation, which, can, worsen, disease, in, people, with, significant, symptoms, of, metastases, in, these, people, gnrh, antagonists, like, degarelix, or, relugolix, are, given, instead, and, can, also, rapidly, reduce, testosterone, levels, reducing, testosterone, can, cause, various, side, effects, including, hot, flashes, reduction, in, muscle, mass, and, bone, density, reduced, sex, drive, fatigue, personality, changes, and, an, increased, risk, of, diabetes, cardiovascular, disease, and, depression, hormone, therapy, halts, tumor, growth, in, more, than, 95, of, those, treated, and, psa, levels, return, to, normal, in, up, to, 70, despite, reduced, testosterone, levels, metastatic, prostate, tumors, eventually, continue, to, grow, manifested, by, rising, blood, psa, levels, and, metastases, to, nearby, bones, this, is, the, most, advanced, stage, of, the, disease, called, castration, resistant, prostate, cancer, crpc, crpc, tumors, continuously, evolve, resistance, to, treatments, necessitating, several, lines, of, therapy, each, used, in, sequence, to, extend, survival, the, standard, of, care, is, the, chemotherapy, docetaxel, along, with, antiandrogen, drugs, namely, the, androgen, receptor, antagonists, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and, darolutamide, as, well, as, the, testosterone, production, inhibitor, abiraterone, acetate, an, alternative, is, the, cell, therapy, procedure, sipuleucel, t, where, the, affected, person, s, immune, cells, are, removed, treated, to, more, effectively, target, prostate, cancer, cells, and, re, injected, tumors, that, evolve, resistance, to, docetaxel, may, receive, the, second, generation, taxane, drug, cabazitaxel, some, crpc, treatments, are, used, only, in, men, whose, tumors, have, certain, characteristics, that, make, the, therapy, more, likely, to, be, effective, men, whose, tumors, express, the, protein, psma, may, receive, the, radiopharmaceutical, lu, 177, psma, which, binds, to, and, destroys, psma, positive, cells, those, whose, tumors, have, defective, dna, damage, repair, benefit, from, treatment, with, the, immune, checkpoint, inhibitor, drug, pembrolizumab, and, parp, inhibitors, namely, olaparib, rucaparib, or, niraparib, bone, metastases, present, in, around, 85, of, those, with, metastatic, prostate, cancer, are, the, primary, cause, of, symptoms, and, death, from, metastatic, prostate, cancer, those, with, constant, pain, are, prescribed, nonsteroidal, anti, inflammatory, drugs, however, people, with, bone, metastases, can, experience, breakthrough, pain, sudden, bursts, of, severe, pain, that, resolve, within, around, 15, minutes, before, pain, medications, can, take, effect, single, sites, of, pain, can, be, treated, with, external, beam, radiation, therapy, to, shrink, nearby, tumors, more, dispersed, bone, pain, can, be, treated, with, radioactive, compounds, that, disproportionately, accumulate, in, bone, like, radium, 223, and, samarium, 153, edtmp, which, help, reduce, the, size, of, bone, tumors, similarly, the, systemic, chemotherapeutics, used, for, metastatic, prostate, cancer, can, reduce, pain, as, they, shrink, tumors, other, bone, modifying, agents, like, zoledronic, acid, and, denosumab, can, reduce, prostate, cancer, bone, pain, even, though, they, have, little, effect, on, tumor, size, metastases, compress, the, spinal, cord, in, up, to, 12, of, those, with, metastatic, prostate, cancer, causing, pain, weakness, numbness, and, paralysis, inflammation, in, the, spine, can, be, treated, with, high, dose, steroids, as, well, as, surgery, and, radiotherapy, to, shrink, spinal, tumors, and, relieve, pressure, on, the, spinal, cord, those, with, advanced, prostate, cancer, suffer, fatigue, lethargy, and, a, generalized, weakness, this, is, caused, in, part, by, gastrointestinal, problems, with, loss, of, appetite, weight, loss, nausea, and, constipation, all, common, these, are, typically, treated, with, appetite, increasing, drugs, megestrol, acetate, or, corticosteroids, antiemetics, or, treatments, that, focus, on, underlying, gastrointestinal, issues, general, weakness, can, also, be, caused, by, anemia, itself, caused, by, a, combination, of, the, disease, itself, poor, nutrition, and, damage, to, the, bone, marrow, from, cancer, treatments, or, bone, metastases, anemia, can, be, treated, in, various, ways, depending, on, the, cause, or, can, be, addressed, directly, with, blood, transfusions, organ, damage, and, metastases, in, the, lymph, nodes, can, lead, to, uncomfortable, accumulation, of, fluid, called, lymphedema, in, the, genitals, or, lower, limbs, these, swellings, can, be, extremely, painful, curtailing, an, affected, person, s, ability, to, urinate, have, sex, or, walk, normally, lymphedema, can, be, treated, by, applying, pressure, to, aid, drainage, surgically, draining, pooled, fluid, and, cleaning, and, treating, nearby, damaged, skin, people, with, prostate, cancer, are, around, twice, as, likely, to, experience, anxiety, or, depression, compared, to, those, without, cancer, when, added, to, normal, prostate, cancer, treatments, psychological, interventions, such, as, psychoeducation, and, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, can, help, reduce, anxiety, depression, and, general, distress, as, those, severely, ill, with, metastatic, prostate, cancer, approach, the, end, of, their, lives, most, experience, confusion, and, may, hallucinate, or, have, trouble, recognizing, loved, ones, confusion, is, caused, by, various, conditions, including, kidney, failure, sepsis, dehydration, and, as, a, side, effect, of, various, drugs, especially, opioids, most, people, sleep, for, long, periods, and, some, feel, drowsy, when, awake, restlessness, is, also, common, sometimes, caused, by, physical, discomfort, from, constipation, or, urinary, retention, sometimes, caused, by, anxiety, in, their, last, few, days, affected, men, s, breathing, may, become, shallow, and, slow, with, long, pauses, between, breaths, breathing, may, be, accompanied, by, a, rattling, noise, as, fluid, lingers, in, the, throat, but, this, is, not, uncomfortable, for, the, affected, person, their, hands, and, feet, may, cool, to, the, touch, and, skin, become, blotchy, or, blue, due, to, weaker, blood, circulation, many, stop, eating, and, drinking, resulting, in, dry, feeling, mouth, which, can, be, aided, by, moistening, the, mouth, and, lips, the, person, becomes, less, and, less, responsive, and, eventually, the, heart, and, breathing, stop, the, prognosis, of, diagnosed, prostate, cancer, varies, widely, based, on, the, cancer, s, grade, and, stage, at, the, time, of, diagnosis, those, with, lower, stage, disease, have, vastly, improved, prognoses, around, 80, of, prostate, cancer, diagnoses, are, in, men, whose, cancer, is, still, confined, to, the, prostate, these, men, can, survive, long, after, diagnosis, with, as, many, as, 99, still, alive, 10, years, from, diagnosis, men, whose, cancer, has, metastasized, to, a, nearby, part, of, the, body, around, 15, of, diagnoses, have, poorer, prognoses, with, five, year, survival, rates, of, 60, 80, those, with, metastases, in, distant, body, sites, around, 5, of, diagnoses, have, relatively, poor, prognoses, with, five, year, survival, rates, of, 30, 40, those, who, have, low, blood, psa, levels, at, diagnosis, and, whose, tumors, have, a, low, gleason, grade, and, less, advanced, clinical, stage, tend, to, have, better, prognoses, after, prostatectomy, or, radiotherapy, those, who, have, a, short, time, between, treatment, and, a, subsequent, rise, in, psa, levels, or, quickly, rising, psa, levels, are, more, likely, to, die, from, their, cancers, castration, resistant, metastatic, prostate, cancer, is, incurable, and, kills, a, majority, of, those, whose, disease, reaches, this, stage, prostate, cancer, is, caused, by, the, accumulation, of, genetic, mutations, to, the, dna, of, cells, in, the, prostate, these, mutations, affect, genes, involved, in, cell, growth, replication, cell, death, and, dna, damage, repair, with, these, processes, dysregulated, some, cells, replicate, abnormally, forming, a, clump, of, cells, called, a, tumor, as, the, tumor, grows, its, cells, accumulate, more, mutations, allowing, it, to, stimulate, the, growth, of, new, blood, vessels, to, support, further, growth, eventually, a, tumor, can, grow, large, enough, to, invade, nearby, organs, such, as, the, seminal, vesicles, or, bladder, in, advanced, tumors, cells, can, develop, the, ability, to, detach, from, their, original, tissue, site, and, evade, the, immune, system, these, cells, can, spread, through, the, lymphatic, system, to, nearby, lymph, nodes, or, through, the, bloodstream, to, the, bone, marrow, and, more, rarely, other, body, sites, at, these, new, sites, the, cancer, cells, disrupt, normal, body, function, and, continue, to, grow, metastases, cause, most, of, the, discomfort, associated, with, prostate, cancer, and, can, eventually, kill, the, affected, person, most, prostate, tumors, begin, in, the, peripheral, zone, the, outermost, part, of, the, prostate, as, cells, begin, to, grow, out, of, control, they, form, a, small, clump, of, disregulated, cells, called, a, prostatic, intraepithelial, neoplasia, pin, some, pins, continue, to, grow, forming, layers, of, tissue, that, stop, expressing, genes, common, to, their, original, tissue, location, p63, cytokeratin, 5, and, cytokeratin, 14, and, instead, begin, expressing, genes, typical, of, cells, in, the, innermost, lining, of, the, pancreatic, duct, cytokeratin, 8, and, cytokeratin, 18, these, multilayered, pins, also, often, overexpress, the, gene, amacr, which, is, associated, with, prostate, cancer, progression, some, pins, can, eventually, grow, into, tumors, this, is, commonly, accompanied, by, large, scale, changes, to, the, genome, with, chromosome, sequences, being, rearranged, or, copied, repeatedly, some, genomic, alterations, are, particularly, common, in, early, prostate, cancer, namely, gene, fusion, between, tmprss2, and, the, oncogene, erg, up, to, 60, of, prostate, tumors, mutations, that, disable, spop, up, to, 15, of, tumors, and, mutations, that, hyperactivate, foxa1, up, to, 5, of, tumors, metastatic, prostate, cancer, tends, to, have, more, genetic, mutations, than, localized, disease, many, of, these, mutations, are, in, genes, that, protect, from, dna, damage, such, as, p53, mutated, in, 8, of, localized, tumors, more, than, 27, of, metastatic, ones, and, rb1, 1, of, localized, tumors, more, than, 5, of, metastatic, ones, similarly, mutations, in, the, dna, repair, related, genes, brca2, and, atm, are, rare, in, localized, disease, but, found, in, at, least, 7, and, 5, of, metastatic, disease, cases, respectively, the, transition, from, castrate, sensitive, to, castrate, resistant, prostate, cancer, is, also, accompanied, by, the, acquisition, of, various, gene, mutations, in, castrate, resistant, disease, more, than, 70, of, tumors, have, mutations, in, the, androgen, receptor, signaling, pathway, amplifications, and, gain, of, function, mutations, in, the, receptor, gene, itself, amplification, of, its, activators, for, example, foxa1, or, inactivating, mutations, in, its, negative, regulators, for, example, zbtb16, and, ncor1, these, androgen, receptor, disruptions, are, only, found, in, up, to, 6, of, biopsies, of, castrate, sensitive, metastatic, disease, similarly, deletions, of, the, tumor, suppressor, pten, are, harbored, by, 12, 17, of, castrate, sensitive, tumors, but, over, 40, of, castrate, resistant, tumors, less, commonly, tumors, have, aberrant, activation, of, the, wnt, signaling, pathway, via, disruption, of, members, apc, 9, of, tumors, or, ctnnb1, 4, of, tumors, or, dysregulation, of, the, pi3k, pathway, via, pi3kca, pi3kcb, mutations, 6, of, tumors, or, akt1, 2, of, tumors, prostate, cancer, is, the, second, most, frequently, diagnosed, cancer, in, men, and, the, second, most, frequent, cause, of, cancer, death, in, men, after, lung, cancer, around, 1, 2, million, new, cases, of, prostate, cancer, are, diagnosed, each, year, and, over, 350, 000, people, die, of, the, disease, annually, one, in, eight, men, are, diagnosed, with, prostate, cancer, in, their, lifetime, and, around, one, in, forty, die, of, the, disease, rates, of, prostate, cancer, rise, with, age, due, to, this, prostate, cancer, rates, are, generally, higher, in, parts, of, the, world, with, higher, life, expectancy, which, also, tend, to, be, areas, with, higher, gross, domestic, product, and, higher, human, development, index, australia, europe, north, america, new, zealand, and, parts, of, south, america, have, the, highest, incidence, south, asia, central, asia, and, sub, saharan, africa, have, the, lowest, incidence, of, prostate, cancer, though, incidence, is, increasing, quickly, in, these, regions, prostate, cancer, is, the, most, diagnosed, cancer, in, men, in, over, half, of, the, world, s, countries, and, the, leading, cause, of, cancer, death, in, men, in, around, a, quarter, of, countries, prostate, cancer, is, rare, in, those, under, 40, years, old, and, most, cases, occur, in, those, over, 60, years, with, the, average, person, diagnosed, at, 67, the, average, age, of, those, who, die, from, prostate, cancer, is, 77, only, a, minority, of, prostate, cancer, cases, are, diagnosed, autopsies, of, men, who, died, at, various, ages, have, shown, cancer, in, the, prostates, of, over, 40, of, men, over, age, 50, incidence, rises, with, age, and, nearly, 70, of, men, autopsied, at, age, 80, 89, had, cancer, in, their, prostates, prostate, cancer, is, more, common, in, families, with, a, history, of, any, cancer, men, with, an, affected, first, degree, relative, father, or, brother, have, more, than, twice, the, risk, of, developing, prostate, cancer, and, those, with, two, first, degree, relatives, have, a, five, fold, greater, risk, compared, with, men, with, no, family, history, increased, risk, also, runs, in, some, ethnic, groups, with, men, of, african, and, african, caribbean, ancestry, at, particularly, high, risk, having, prostate, cancer, at, higher, rates, and, having, more, aggressive, prostate, cancers, that, develop, at, earlier, ages, large, genome, wide, association, studies, have, identified, over, 100, gene, variants, associated, with, increased, prostate, cancer, risk, the, greatest, risk, increase, is, associated, with, variations, in, brca2, up, to, an, eight, fold, increased, risk, and, hoxb13, three, fold, increased, risk, both, of, which, are, involved, in, repairing, dna, damage, variants, in, other, genes, involved, in, dna, damage, repair, have, also, been, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, developing, prostate, cancer, particularly, early, onset, prostate, cancer, including, brca1, atm, nbs1, msh2, msh6, pms2, chek2, rad51d, and, palb2, additionally, variants, in, the, genome, near, the, oncogene, myc, are, associated, with, increased, risk, as, are, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, in, the, vitamin, d, receptor, common, in, african, americans, and, in, the, androgen, receptor, cyp3a4, and, cyp17, involved, in, testosterone, synthesis, and, signaling, together, known, gene, variants, are, estimated, to, cause, around, 25, of, prostate, cancer, cases, including, 40, of, early, onset, prostate, cancers, men, who, are, taller, are, at, a, slightly, increased, risk, for, developing, prostate, cancer, as, are, men, who, are, obese, high, levels, of, blood, cholesterol, are, also, associated, with, increased, prostate, cancer, risk, consequently, those, who, take, the, cholesterol, lowering, drugs, statins, have, a, reduced, risk, of, advanced, prostate, cancer, chronic, inflammation, can, cause, various, cancers, potential, links, between, infection, or, other, sources, of, inflammation, and, prostate, cancer, have, been, studied, but, none, definitively, found, and, one, large, study, found, no, link, between, prostate, cancer, and, a, history, of, gonorrhea, syphilis, chlamydia, or, infection, with, various, human, papillomaviruses, regular, vigorous, exercise, may, reduce, one, s, chance, of, developing, advanced, prostate, cancer, as, can, several, dietary, interventions, those, with, a, diet, rich, in, cruciferous, vegetables, certain, leafy, greens, broccoli, and, cauliflower, fish, genistein, found, in, soy, or, lycopene, found, in, tomatoes, are, at, a, reduced, risk, of, symptomatic, prostate, cancer, conversely, those, who, consume, high, levels, of, dietary, fats, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, from, cooking, red, meats, or, calcium, may, be, at, an, increased, risk, of, developing, advanced, prostate, cancer, several, dietary, supplements, have, been, studied, and, found, not, to, impact, prostate, cancer, risk, including, selenium, vitamin, c, vitamin, d, and, vitamin, e, transgender, women, and, gender, non, conforming, people, who, have, prostates, can, develop, prostate, cancer, those, who, have, undergone, gender, affirming, hormone, therapy, or, gender, affirming, surgery, have, reduced, risk, of, developing, prostate, cancer, relative, to, cisgender, men, of, similar, age, screening, tests, in, this, group, are, complicated, as, transgender, women, may, have, lower, psa, levels, than, cisgender, men, due, to, their, reduced, testosterone, levels, psa, levels, greater, than, 1, ng, ml, are, generally, considered, above, normal, by, gender, care, specialists, digital, rectal, exams, of, the, prostate, are, often, impossible, in, women, who, have, undergone, vaginoplasty, as, the, length, and, rigidity, of, the, new, vagina, can, obstruct, access, to, the, prostate, from, the, rectum, a, prostate, mass, was, first, described, in, 1817, by, the, english, surgeon, george, langstaff, following, the, autopsy, of, a, man, who, had, died, at, age, 68, with, lower, body, pain, and, urinary, issues, in, 1853, london, hospital, surgeon, john, adams, described, another, prostate, tumor, from, a, man, who, had, died, with, urinary, issues, adams, had, a, pathologist, examine, the, tumor, providing, the, first, confirmed, case, of, a, cancerous, tumor, in, the, prostate, the, disease, was, initially, rarely, described, an, 1893, report, found, only, 50, cases, described, in, the, medical, literature, around, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, prostate, surgery, to, relieve, urinary, obstruction, became, more, common, allowing, surgeons, and, pathologists, to, examine, the, removed, prostate, tissue, two, studies, around, the, time, found, cancer, in, as, many, as, 10, of, surgical, specimens, suggesting, prostate, cancer, was, a, fairly, common, cause, of, prostate, enlargement, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, the, primary, therapy, for, prostate, cancer, was, surgery, to, remove, the, prostate, perineal, prostatectomy, was, first, performed, in, 1904, by, hugh, h, young, at, johns, hopkins, hospital, young, s, method, became, the, widespread, standard, initially, done, primarily, to, relieve, symptoms, of, urinary, blockage, in, 1931, a, new, surgical, method, transurethral, resection, of, the, prostate, became, available, replacing, perineal, prostatectomy, for, symptomatic, relief, of, obstruction, in, 1945, terence, millin, described, a, retropubic, prostatectomy, approach, which, provided, easier, access, to, pelvic, lymph, nodes, to, assist, in, staging, the, extent, of, disease, and, was, easier, for, surgeons, to, learn, this, was, improved, upon, by, patrick, c, walsh, s, 1983, description, of, a, retropubic, prostatectomy, approach, that, avoided, damage, to, the, nerves, near, the, prostate, preserving, erectile, function, radiation, therapy, for, prostate, cancer, was, used, occasionally, in, the, early, 20th, century, with, radium, implanted, into, the, urethra, or, rectum, to, reduce, the, tumor, size, and, associated, symptoms, in, the, 1950s, the, advent, of, more, powerful, radiation, machines, allowed, for, external, beam, radiotherapy, to, reach, the, prostate, by, the, 1960s, this, was, often, combined, with, hormone, therapy, to, improve, the, potency, of, therapy, in, the, 1970s, willet, whitmore, pioneered, an, open, surgery, technique, where, needles, of, iodine, 125, were, placed, directly, into, the, prostate, this, was, improved, upon, by, henrik, h, holm, in, 1983, by, using, transrectal, ultrasound, to, guide, the, implantation, of, radioactive, material, the, observation, that, the, testicles, and, the, hormones, they, secrete, influence, prostate, size, was, made, as, early, as, the, late, 18th, century, via, castration, experiments, in, animals, however, occasional, experimentation, over, the, next, century, bore, mixed, results, likely, due, to, the, inability, to, separate, prostate, tumors, from, prostates, enlarged, due, to, benign, prostatic, hyperplasia, in, 1941, charles, b, huggins, and, clarence, v, hodges, published, two, studies, using, surgical, castration, or, oral, estrogen, to, reduce, androgen, levels, and, improve, prostate, cancer, symptoms, huggins, was, awarded, the, 1966, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, this, discovery, the, first, systemic, therapy, for, prostate, cancer, in, the, 1960s, large, studies, showed, estrogen, therapy, to, be, as, effective, as, surgical, castration, at, treating, prostate, cancer, but, that, those, on, estrogen, therapy, were, at, increased, risk, of, suffering, blood, clots, through, the, 1980s, andrzej, w, schally, s, studies, of, gnrh, led, to, the, development, of, gnrh, agonists, which, were, found, to, be, as, effective, as, estrogen, without, the, increased, risk, of, clotting, schally, was, awarded, the, 1977, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, his, work, on, gnrh, and, prostate, cancer, systemic, chemotherapy, for, prostate, cancer, has, been, studied, since, the, 1950s, but, clinical, trials, failed, to, show, benefits, in, most, people, who, receive, the, drugs, in, 1996, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, approved, the, systemic, chemotherapy, mitoxantrone, for, those, with, castration, resistant, prostate, cancer, based, on, trials, showing, that, it, improved, symptoms, even, though, it, failed, to, enhance, survival, in, 2004, docetaxel, was, approved, as, the, first, chemotherapy, to, increase, survival, in, those, with, castration, resistant, prostate, cancer, after, additional, trials, in, 2015, docetaxel, use, was, extended, to, those, with, castration, sensitive, prostate, cancer, prostate, cancer, screening, and, awareness, have, been, widely, promoted, since, the, early, 2000s, by, prostate, cancer, awareness, month, in, september, and, movember, in, november, however, an, analysis, of, internet, searches, suggests, neither, event, changes, the, level, of, prostate, cancer, interest, or, discussion, much, in, contrast, to, the, more, established, breast, cancer, awareness, month, prostate, cancer, is, a, major, topic, of, ongoing, research, from, 2016, 2020, over, 1, 26, billion, was, invested, in, prostate, cancer, research, representing, around, 5, of, global, cancer, research, funds, this, places, prostate, cancer, 10th, among, 18, common, cancer, types, in, funding, per, cancer, death, and, 9th, in, funding, per, disability, adjusted, life, year, lost, research, into, prostate, cancer, relies, on, a, number, of, laboratory, models, to, test, aspects, of, the, disease, several, prostate, immortalized, cell, lines, are, widely, used, namely, the, classic, lines, du145, pc, 3, and, lncap, as, well, as, more, recent, cell, lines, 22rv1, lapc, 4, vcap, and, mda, pca, 2a, and, 2b, research, requiring, more, complex, models, of, the, prostate, uses, organoids, clusters, of, prostate, cells, that, can, be, grown, from, human, prostate, tumors, or, stem, cells, modeling, tumor, growth, and, metastasis, requires, a, model, organism, typically, a, mouse, researchers, can, either, surgically, implant, human, prostate, tumors, into, immunocompromised, mice, a, technique, called, a, patient, derived, xenograft, or, induce, prostate, tumors, in, mice, with, genetic, engineering, these, genetically, engineered, mouse, models, typically, use, a, cre, recombinase, system, to, disrupt, tumor, suppressors, or, activate, oncogenes, specifically, in, prostate, cells
