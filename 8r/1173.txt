plankton, are, the, diverse, collection, of, organisms, that, drift, in, water, or, air, but, are, unable, to, actively, propel, themselves, against, currents, or, wind, the, individual, organisms, constituting, plankton, are, called, plankters, in, the, ocean, they, provide, a, crucial, source, of, food, to, many, small, and, large, aquatic, organisms, such, as, bivalves, fish, and, baleen, whales, marine, plankton, include, bacteria, archaea, algae, protozoa, microscopic, fungi, and, drifting, or, floating, animals, that, inhabit, the, saltwater, of, oceans, and, the, brackish, waters, of, estuaries, freshwater, plankton, are, similar, to, marine, plankton, but, are, found, in, lakes, and, rivers, mostly, plankton, just, drift, where, currents, take, them, though, some, like, jellyfish, swim, slowly, but, not, fast, enough, to, generally, gain, control, from, the, influence, of, currents, although, plankton, are, usually, thought, of, as, inhabiting, water, there, are, also, airborne, versions, that, live, part, of, their, lives, drifting, in, the, atmosphere, these, aeroplankton, include, plant, spores, pollen, and, wind, scattered, seeds, they, may, also, include, microorganisms, swept, into, the, air, from, terrestrial, dust, storms, and, oceanic, plankton, swept, into, the, air, by, sea, spray, though, many, planktonic, species, are, microscopic, in, size, plankton, includes, organisms, over, a, wide, range, of, sizes, including, large, organisms, such, as, jellyfish, this, is, because, plankton, are, defined, by, their, ecological, niche, and, level, of, motility, rather, than, by, any, phylogenetic, or, taxonomic, classification, the, plankton, category, differentiates, these, organisms, from, those, that, float, on, the, water, s, surface, called, neuston, those, that, can, swim, against, a, current, called, nekton, and, those, that, live, on, the, deep, sea, floor, called, benthos, the, name, plankton, was, coined, by, german, marine, biologist, victor, hensen, in, 1887, from, shortening, the, word, halyplankton, from, greek, h, ls, sea, and, plan, to, drift, or, wander, 1, while, some, forms, are, capable, of, independent, movement, and, can, swim, hundreds, of, meters, vertically, in, a, single, day, a, behavior, called, diel, vertical, migration, their, horizontal, position, is, primarily, determined, by, the, surrounding, water, movement, and, plankton, typically, flow, with, ocean, currents, this, is, in, contrast, to, nekton, organisms, such, as, fish, squid, and, marine, mammals, which, can, swim, against, the, ambient, flow, and, control, their, position, in, the, environment, within, the, plankton, holoplankton, spend, their, entire, life, cycle, as, plankton, e, g, most, algae, copepods, salps, and, some, jellyfish, by, contrast, meroplankton, are, only, planktic, for, part, of, their, lives, usually, the, larval, stage, and, then, graduate, to, either, a, nektic, swimming, or, benthic, sea, floor, existence, examples, of, meroplankton, include, the, larvae, of, sea, urchins, starfish, crustaceans, marine, worms, and, most, fish, the, amount, and, distribution, of, plankton, depends, on, available, nutrients, the, state, of, water, and, a, large, amount, of, other, plankton, the, study, of, plankton, is, termed, planktology, and, a, planktonic, individual, is, referred, to, as, a, plankter, the, adjective, planktonic, is, widely, used, in, both, the, scientific, and, popular, literature, and, is, a, generally, accepted, term, however, from, the, standpoint, of, prescriptive, grammar, the, less, commonly, used, planktic, is, more, strictly, the, correct, adjective, when, deriving, english, words, from, their, greek, or, latin, roots, the, gender, specific, ending, in, this, case, on, which, indicates, the, word, is, neuter, is, normally, dropped, using, only, the, root, of, the, word, in, the, derivation, plankton, are, primarily, divided, into, broad, functional, or, trophic, level, groups, recognition, of, the, importance, of, mixotrophy, as, an, ecological, strategy, is, increasing, as, well, as, the, wider, role, this, may, play, in, marine, biogeochemistry, studies, have, shown, that, mixotrophs, are, much, more, important, for, marine, ecology, than, previously, assumed, and, comprise, more, than, half, of, all, microscopic, plankton, their, presence, acts, as, a, buffer, that, prevents, the, collapse, of, ecosystems, during, times, with, little, to, no, light, plankton, are, also, often, described, in, terms, of, size, usually, the, following, divisions, are, used, however, some, of, these, terms, may, be, used, with, very, different, boundaries, especially, on, the, larger, end, the, existence, and, importance, of, nano, and, even, smaller, plankton, was, only, discovered, during, the, 1980s, but, they, are, thought, to, make, up, the, largest, proportion, of, all, plankton, in, number, and, diversity, the, microplankton, and, smaller, groups, are, microorganisms, and, operate, at, low, reynolds, numbers, where, the, viscosity, of, water, is, more, important, than, its, mass, or, inertia, marine, plankton, includes, marine, bacteria, and, archaea, algae, protozoa, and, drifting, or, floating, animals, that, inhabit, the, saltwater, of, oceans, and, the, brackish, waters, of, estuaries, freshwater, plankton, are, similar, to, marine, plankton, but, are, found, inland, in, the, freshwaters, of, lakes, and, rivers, aeroplankton, are, tiny, lifeforms, that, float, and, drift, in, the, air, carried, by, the, current, of, the, wind, they, are, the, atmospheric, analogue, to, oceanic, plankton, most, of, the, living, things, that, make, up, aeroplankton, are, very, small, to, microscopic, in, size, and, many, can, be, difficult, to, identify, because, of, their, tiny, size, scientists, can, collect, them, for, study, in, traps, and, sweep, nets, from, aircraft, kites, or, balloons, aeroplankton, is, made, up, of, numerous, microbes, including, viruses, about, 1000, different, species, of, bacteria, around, 40, 000, varieties, of, fungi, and, hundreds, of, species, of, protists, algae, mosses, and, liverworts, that, live, some, part, of, their, life, cycle, as, aeroplankton, often, as, spores, pollen, and, wind, scattered, seeds, additionally, peripatetic, microorganisms, are, swept, into, the, air, from, terrestrial, dust, storms, and, an, even, larger, amount, of, airborne, marine, microorganisms, are, propelled, high, into, the, atmosphere, in, sea, spray, aeroplankton, deposits, hundreds, of, millions, of, airborne, viruses, and, tens, of, millions, of, bacteria, every, day, on, every, square, meter, around, the, planet, the, sea, surface, microlayer, compared, to, the, sub, surface, waters, contains, elevated, concentration, of, bacteria, and, viruses, these, materials, can, be, transferred, from, the, sea, surface, to, the, atmosphere, in, the, form, of, wind, generated, aqueous, aerosols, due, to, their, high, vapour, tension, and, a, process, known, as, volatilisation, when, airborne, these, microbes, can, be, transported, long, distances, to, coastal, regions, if, they, hit, land, they, can, have, an, effect, on, animal, vegetation, and, human, health, marine, aerosols, that, contain, viruses, can, travel, hundreds, of, kilometers, from, their, source, and, remain, in, liquid, form, as, long, as, the, humidity, is, high, enough, over, 70, these, aerosols, are, able, to, remain, suspended, in, the, atmosphere, for, about, 31, days, evidence, suggests, that, bacteria, can, remain, viable, after, being, transported, inland, through, aerosols, some, reached, as, far, as, 200, meters, at, 30, meters, above, sea, level, the, process, which, transfers, this, material, to, the, atmosphere, causes, further, enrichment, in, both, bacteria, and, viruses, in, comparison, to, either, the, sml, or, sub, surface, waters, up, to, three, orders, of, magnitude, in, some, locations, many, animals, live, in, terrestrial, environments, by, thriving, in, transient, often, microscopic, bodies, of, water, and, moisture, these, include, rotifers, and, gastrotrichs, which, lay, resilient, eggs, capable, of, surviving, years, in, dry, environments, and, some, of, which, can, go, dormant, themselves, nematodes, are, usually, microscopic, with, this, lifestyle, water, bears, despite, only, having, lifespans, of, a, few, months, famously, can, enter, suspended, animation, during, dry, or, hostile, conditions, and, survive, for, decades, this, allows, them, to, be, ubiquitous, in, terrestrial, environments, despite, needing, water, to, grow, and, reproduce, many, microscopic, crustacean, groups, like, copepods, and, amphipods, of, which, sandhoppers, are, members, and, seed, shrimp, are, known, to, go, dormant, when, dry, and, live, in, transient, bodies, of, water, too, gelatinous, zooplankton, are, fragile, animals, that, live, in, the, water, column, in, the, ocean, their, delicate, bodies, have, no, hard, parts, and, are, easily, damaged, or, destroyed, gelatinous, zooplankton, are, often, transparent, all, jellyfish, are, gelatinous, zooplankton, but, not, all, gelatinous, zooplankton, are, jellyfish, the, most, commonly, encountered, organisms, include, ctenophores, medusae, salps, and, chaetognatha, in, coastal, waters, however, almost, all, marine, phyla, including, annelida, mollusca, and, arthropoda, contain, gelatinous, species, but, many, of, those, odd, species, live, in, the, open, ocean, and, the, deep, sea, and, are, less, available, to, the, casual, ocean, observer, ichthyoplankton, are, the, eggs, and, larvae, of, fish, they, are, mostly, found, in, the, sunlit, zone, of, the, water, column, less, than, 200, metres, deep, which, is, sometimes, called, the, epipelagic, or, photic, zone, ichthyoplankton, are, planktonic, meaning, they, cannot, swim, effectively, under, their, own, power, but, must, drift, with, the, ocean, currents, fish, eggs, cannot, swim, at, all, and, are, unambiguously, planktonic, early, stage, larvae, swim, poorly, but, later, stage, larvae, swim, better, and, cease, to, be, planktonic, as, they, grow, into, juveniles, fish, larvae, are, part, of, the, zooplankton, that, eat, smaller, plankton, while, fish, eggs, carry, their, food, supply, both, eggs, and, larvae, are, themselves, eaten, by, larger, animals, fish, can, produce, high, numbers, of, eggs, which, are, often, released, into, the, open, water, column, fish, eggs, typically, have, a, diameter, of, about, 1, millimetre, 0, 039, in, the, newly, hatched, young, of, oviparous, fish, are, called, larvae, they, are, usually, poorly, formed, carry, a, large, yolk, sac, for, nourishment, and, are, very, different, in, appearance, from, juvenile, and, adult, specimens, the, larval, period, in, oviparous, fish, is, relatively, short, usually, only, several, weeks, and, larvae, rapidly, grow, and, change, appearance, and, structure, a, process, termed, metamorphosis, to, become, juveniles, during, this, transition, larvae, must, switch, from, their, yolk, sac, to, feeding, on, zooplankton, prey, a, process, which, depends, on, typically, inadequate, zooplankton, density, starving, many, larvae, in, time, fish, larvae, become, able, to, swim, against, currents, at, which, point, they, cease, to, be, plankton, and, become, juvenile, fish, holoplankton, are, organisms, that, are, planktic, for, their, entire, life, cycle, holoplankton, can, be, contrasted, with, meroplankton, which, are, planktic, organisms, that, spend, part, of, their, life, cycle, in, the, benthic, zone, examples, of, holoplankton, include, some, diatoms, radiolarians, some, dinoflagellates, foraminifera, amphipods, krill, copepods, and, salps, as, well, as, some, gastropod, mollusk, species, holoplankton, dwell, in, the, pelagic, zone, as, opposed, to, the, benthic, zone, holoplankton, include, both, phytoplankton, and, zooplankton, and, vary, in, size, the, most, common, plankton, are, protists, meroplankton, are, a, wide, variety, of, aquatic, organisms, that, have, both, planktonic, and, benthic, stages, in, their, life, cycles, much, of, the, meroplankton, consists, of, larval, stages, of, larger, organisms, meroplankton, can, be, contrasted, with, holoplankton, which, are, planktonic, organisms, that, stay, in, the, pelagic, zone, as, plankton, throughout, their, entire, life, cycle, after, some, time, in, the, plankton, many, meroplankton, graduate, to, the, nekton, or, adopt, a, benthic, often, sessile, lifestyle, on, the, seafloor, the, larval, stages, of, benthic, invertebrates, make, up, a, significant, proportion, of, planktonic, communities, the, planktonic, larval, stage, is, particularly, crucial, to, many, benthic, invertebrates, in, order, to, disperse, their, young, depending, on, the, particular, species, and, the, environmental, conditions, larval, or, juvenile, stage, meroplankton, may, remain, in, the, pelagic, zone, for, durations, ranging, from, hours, to, months, pseudoplankton, are, organisms, that, attach, themselves, to, planktonic, organisms, or, other, floating, objects, such, as, drifting, wood, buoyant, shells, of, organisms, such, as, spirula, or, man, made, flotsam, examples, include, goose, barnacles, and, the, bryozoan, jellyella, by, themselves, these, animals, cannot, float, which, contrasts, them, with, true, planktonic, organisms, such, as, velella, and, the, portuguese, man, o, war, which, are, buoyant, pseudoplankton, are, often, found, in, the, guts, of, filtering, zooplankters, tychoplankton, are, organisms, such, as, free, living, or, attached, benthic, organisms, and, other, non, planktonic, organisms, that, are, carried, into, the, plankton, through, a, disturbance, of, their, benthic, habitat, or, by, winds, and, currents, this, can, occur, by, direct, turbulence, or, by, disruption, of, the, substrate, and, subsequent, entrainment, in, the, water, column, tychoplankton, are, therefore, a, primary, subdivision, for, sorting, planktonic, organisms, by, duration, of, lifecycle, spent, in, the, plankton, as, neither, their, entire, lives, nor, particular, reproductive, portions, are, confined, to, planktonic, existence, tychoplankton, are, sometimes, called, accidental, plankton, apart, from, aeroplankton, plankton, inhabits, oceans, seas, lakes, and, ponds, local, abundance, varies, horizontally, vertically, and, seasonally, the, primary, cause, of, this, variability, is, the, availability, of, light, all, plankton, ecosystems, are, driven, by, the, input, of, solar, energy, but, see, chemosynthesis, confining, primary, production, to, surface, waters, and, to, geographical, regions, and, seasons, having, abundant, light, a, secondary, variable, is, nutrient, availability, although, large, areas, of, the, tropical, and, sub, tropical, oceans, have, abundant, light, they, experience, relatively, low, primary, production, because, they, offer, limited, nutrients, such, as, nitrate, phosphate, and, silicate, this, results, from, large, scale, ocean, circulation, and, water, column, stratification, in, such, regions, primary, production, usually, occurs, at, greater, depth, although, at, a, reduced, level, because, of, reduced, light, despite, significant, macronutrient, concentrations, some, ocean, regions, are, unproductive, so, called, hnlc, regions, the, micronutrient, iron, is, deficient, in, these, regions, and, adding, it, can, lead, to, the, formation, of, phytoplankton, algal, blooms, iron, primarily, reaches, the, ocean, through, the, deposition, of, dust, on, the, sea, surface, paradoxically, oceanic, areas, adjacent, to, unproductive, arid, land, thus, typically, have, abundant, phytoplankton, e, g, the, eastern, atlantic, ocean, where, trade, winds, bring, dust, from, the, sahara, desert, in, north, africa, while, plankton, are, most, abundant, in, surface, waters, they, live, throughout, the, water, column, at, depths, where, no, primary, production, occurs, zooplankton, and, bacterioplankton, instead, consume, organic, material, sinking, from, more, productive, surface, waters, above, this, flux, of, sinking, material, so, called, marine, snow, can, be, especially, high, following, the, termination, of, spring, blooms, the, local, distribution, of, plankton, can, be, affected, by, wind, driven, langmuir, circulation, and, the, biological, effects, of, this, physical, process, aside, from, representing, the, bottom, few, levels, of, a, food, chain, that, supports, commercially, important, fisheries, plankton, ecosystems, play, a, role, in, the, biogeochemical, cycles, of, many, important, chemical, elements, including, the, ocean, s, carbon, cycle, fish, larvae, mainly, eat, zooplankton, which, in, turn, eat, phytoplankton, primarily, by, grazing, on, phytoplankton, zooplankton, provide, carbon, to, the, planktic, foodweb, either, respiring, it, to, provide, metabolic, energy, or, upon, death, as, biomass, or, detritus, organic, material, tends, to, be, denser, than, seawater, so, it, sinks, into, open, ocean, ecosystems, away, from, the, coastlines, transporting, carbon, along, with, it, this, process, called, the, biological, pump, is, one, reason, that, oceans, constitute, the, largest, carbon, sink, on, earth, however, it, has, been, shown, to, be, influenced, by, increments, of, temperature, in, 2019, a, study, indicated, that, at, ongoing, rates, of, seawater, acidification, antarctic, phytoplanktons, could, become, smaller, and, less, effective, at, storing, carbon, before, the, end, of, the, century, it, might, be, possible, to, increase, the, ocean, s, uptake, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, generated, through, human, activities, by, increasing, plankton, production, through, iron, fertilization, introducing, amounts, of, iron, into, the, ocean, however, this, technique, may, not, be, practical, at, a, large, scale, ocean, oxygen, depletion, and, resultant, methane, production, caused, by, the, excess, production, remineralising, at, depth, is, one, potential, drawback, phytoplankton, absorb, energy, from, the, sun, and, nutrients, from, the, water, to, produce, their, own, nourishment, or, energy, in, the, process, of, photosynthesis, phytoplankton, release, molecular, oxygen, o, 2, into, the, water, as, a, waste, byproduct, it, is, estimated, that, about, 50, of, the, world, s, oxygen, is, produced, via, phytoplankton, photosynthesis, the, rest, is, produced, via, photosynthesis, on, land, by, plants, furthermore, phytoplankton, photosynthesis, has, controlled, the, atmospheric, co, 2, o, 2, balance, since, the, early, precambrian, eon, the, absorption, efficiency, ae, of, plankton, is, the, proportion, of, food, absorbed, by, the, plankton, that, determines, how, available, the, consumed, organic, materials, are, in, meeting, the, required, physiological, demands, depending, on, the, feeding, rate, and, prey, composition, variations, in, absorption, efficiency, may, lead, to, variations, in, fecal, pellet, production, and, thus, regulates, how, much, organic, material, is, recycled, back, to, the, marine, environment, low, feeding, rates, typically, lead, to, high, absorption, efficiency, and, small, dense, pellets, while, high, feeding, rates, typically, lead, to, low, absorption, efficiency, and, larger, pellets, with, more, organic, content, another, contributing, factor, to, dissolved, organic, matter, dom, release, is, respiration, rate, physical, factors, such, as, oxygen, availability, ph, and, light, conditions, may, affect, overall, oxygen, consumption, and, how, much, carbon, is, loss, from, zooplankton, in, the, form, of, respired, co, 2, the, relative, sizes, of, zooplankton, and, prey, also, mediate, how, much, carbon, is, released, via, sloppy, feeding, smaller, prey, are, ingested, whole, whereas, larger, prey, may, be, fed, on, more, sloppily, that, is, more, biomatter, is, released, through, inefficient, consumption, there, is, also, evidence, that, diet, composition, can, impact, nutrient, release, with, carnivorous, diets, releasing, more, dissolved, organic, carbon, doc, and, ammonium, than, omnivorous, diets, the, growth, of, phytoplankton, populations, is, dependent, on, light, levels, and, nutrient, availability, the, chief, factor, limiting, growth, varies, from, region, to, region, in, the, world, s, oceans, on, a, broad, scale, growth, of, phytoplankton, in, the, oligotrophic, tropical, and, subtropical, gyres, is, generally, limited, by, nutrient, supply, while, light, often, limits, phytoplankton, growth, in, subarctic, gyres, environmental, variability, at, multiple, scales, influences, the, nutrient, and, light, available, for, phytoplankton, and, as, these, organisms, form, the, base, of, the, marine, food, web, this, variability, in, phytoplankton, growth, influences, higher, trophic, levels, for, example, at, interannual, scales, phytoplankton, levels, temporarily, plummet, during, el, ni, o, periods, influencing, populations, of, zooplankton, fishes, sea, birds, and, marine, mammals, the, effects, of, anthropogenic, warming, on, the, global, population, of, phytoplankton, is, an, area, of, active, research, changes, in, the, vertical, stratification, of, the, water, column, the, rate, of, temperature, dependent, biological, reactions, and, the, atmospheric, supply, of, nutrients, are, expected, to, have, important, impacts, on, future, phytoplankton, productivity, additionally, changes, in, the, mortality, of, phytoplankton, due, to, rates, of, zooplankton, grazing, may, be, significant, zooplankton, are, the, initial, prey, item, for, almost, all, fish, larvae, as, they, switch, from, their, yolk, sacs, to, external, feeding, fish, rely, on, the, density, and, distribution, of, zooplankton, to, match, that, of, new, larvae, which, can, otherwise, starve, natural, factors, e, g, current, variations, temperature, changes, and, man, made, factors, e, g, river, dams, ocean, acidification, rising, temperatures, can, strongly, affect, zooplankton, which, can, in, turn, strongly, affect, larval, survival, and, therefore, breeding, success, it, s, been, shown, that, plankton, can, be, patchy, in, marine, environments, where, there, aren, t, significant, fish, populations, and, additionally, where, fish, are, abundant, zooplankton, dynamics, are, influenced, by, the, fish, predation, rate, in, their, environment, depending, on, the, predation, rate, they, could, express, regular, or, chaotic, behavior, a, negative, effect, that, fish, larvae, can, have, on, planktonic, algal, blooms, is, that, the, larvae, will, prolong, the, blooming, event, by, diminishing, available, zooplankton, numbers, this, in, turn, permits, excessive, phytoplankton, growth, allowing, the, bloom, to, flourish, the, importance, of, both, phytoplankton, and, zooplankton, is, also, well, recognized, in, extensive, and, semi, intensive, pond, fish, farming, plankton, population, based, pond, management, strategies, for, fish, rearing, have, been, practiced, by, traditional, fish, farmers, for, decades, illustrating, the, importance, of, plankton, even, in, man, made, environments, of, all, animal, fecal, matter, it, is, whale, feces, that, is, the, trophy, in, terms, of, increasing, nutrient, availability, phytoplankton, are, the, powerhouse, of, open, ocean, primary, production, and, they, can, acquire, many, nutrients, from, whale, feces, in, the, marine, food, web, phytoplankton, are, at, the, base, of, the, food, web, and, are, consumed, by, zooplankton, krill, which, are, preyed, upon, by, larger, and, larger, marine, organisms, including, whales, so, it, can, be, said, that, whale, poop, fuels, the, entire, food, web, plankton, have, many, direct, and, indirect, effects, on, humans, around, 70, of, the, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, is, produced, in, the, oceans, from, phytoplankton, performing, photosynthesis, meaning, that, the, majority, of, the, oxygen, available, for, us, and, other, organisms, that, respire, aerobically, is, produced, by, plankton, plankton, also, make, up, the, base, of, the, marine, food, web, providing, food, for, all, the, trophic, levels, above, recent, studies, have, analyzed, the, marine, food, web, to, see, if, the, system, runs, on, a, top, down, or, bottom, up, approach, essentially, this, research, is, focused, on, understanding, whether, changes, in, the, food, web, are, driven, by, nutrients, at, the, bottom, of, the, food, web, or, predators, at, the, top, the, general, conclusion, is, that, the, bottom, up, approach, seemed, to, be, more, predictive, of, food, web, behavior, this, indicates, that, plankton, have, more, sway, in, determining, the, success, of, the, primary, consumer, species, that, prey, on, them, than, do, the, secondary, consumers, that, prey, on, the, primary, consumers, in, some, cases, plankton, act, as, an, intermediate, host, for, deadly, parasites, in, humans, one, such, case, is, that, of, cholera, an, infection, caused, by, several, pathogenic, strains, of, vibrio, cholerae, these, species, have, been, shown, to, have, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, chitinous, zooplankton, species, like, copepods, these, bacteria, benefit, not, only, from, the, food, provided, by, the, chiton, from, the, zooplankton, but, also, from, the, protection, from, acidic, environments, once, the, copepods, have, been, ingested, by, a, human, host, the, chitinous, exterior, protects, the, bacteria, from, the, stomach, acids, in, the, stomach, and, proceed, to, the, intestines, once, there, the, bacteria, bind, with, the, surface, of, the, small, intestine, and, the, host, will, start, developing, symptoms, including, extreme, diarrhea, within, five, days
