see, text, excavata, is, an, extensive, and, diverse, but, paraphyletic, group, of, unicellular, eukaryota, the, group, was, first, suggested, by, simpson, and, patterson, in, 1999, and, the, name, latinized, and, assigned, a, rank, by, thomas, cavalier, smith, in, 2002, it, contains, a, variety, of, free, living, and, symbiotic, protists, and, includes, some, important, parasites, of, humans, such, as, giardia, and, trichomonas, excavates, were, formerly, considered, to, be, included, in, the, now, obsolete, protista, kingdom, they, were, distinguished, from, other, lineages, based, on, electron, microscopic, information, about, how, the, cells, are, arranged, they, have, a, distinctive, ultrastructural, identity, they, are, considered, to, be, a, basal, flagellate, lineage, on, the, basis, of, phylogenomic, analyses, the, group, was, shown, to, contain, three, widely, separated, eukaryote, groups, the, discobids, metamonads, and, malawimonads, a, current, view, of, the, composition, of, the, excavates, is, given, below, indicating, that, the, group, is, paraphyletic, except, for, some, euglenozoa, all, are, non, photosynthetic, most, excavates, are, unicellular, heterotrophic, flagellates, only, some, euglenozoa, are, photosynthetic, in, some, particularly, anaerobic, intestinal, parasites, the, mitochondria, have, been, greatly, reduced, some, excavates, lack, classical, mitochondria, and, are, called, amitochondriate, although, most, retain, a, mitochondrial, organelle, in, greatly, modified, form, e, g, a, hydrogenosome, or, mitosome, among, those, with, mitochondria, the, mitochondrial, cristae, may, be, tubular, discoidal, or, in, some, cases, laminar, most, excavates, have, two, four, or, more, flagella, many, have, a, conspicuous, ventral, feeding, groove, with, a, characteristic, ultrastructure, supported, by, microtubules, the, excavated, appearance, of, this, groove, giving, the, organisms, their, name, however, various, groups, that, lack, these, traits, are, considered, to, be, derived, excavates, based, on, genetic, evidence, primarily, phylogenetic, trees, of, molecular, sequences, the, acrasidae, slime, molds, are, the, only, excavates, to, exhibit, limited, multicellularity, like, other, cellular, slime, molds, they, live, most, of, their, life, as, single, cells, but, will, sometimes, assemble, into, larger, clusters, excavate, relationships, were, always, uncertain, suggesting, that, they, are, not, a, monophyletic, group, phylogenetic, analyses, often, do, not, place, malawimonads, on, the, same, branch, as, the, other, excavata, excavates, were, thought, to, include, multiple, groups, euglenozoa, and, heterolobosea, percolozoa, or, eozoa, as, named, by, cavalier, smith, appear, to, be, particularly, close, relatives, and, are, united, by, the, presence, of, discoid, cristae, within, the, mitochondria, superphylum, discicristata, a, close, relationship, has, been, shown, between, discicristata, and, jakobida, the, latter, having, tubular, cristae, like, most, other, protists, and, hence, were, united, under, the, taxon, name, discoba, which, was, proposed, for, this, supposedly, monophyletic, group, metamonads, are, unusual, in, not, having, classical, mitochondria, instead, they, have, hydrogenosomes, mitosomes, or, uncharacterised, organelles, the, oxymonad, monocercomonoides, is, reported, to, have, completely, lost, homologous, organelles, there, are, competing, explanations, the, malawimonads, have, been, proposed, to, be, members, of, excavata, owing, to, their, typical, excavate, morphology, and, phylogenetic, affinity, to, other, excavate, groups, in, some, molecular, phylogenies, however, their, position, among, eukaryotes, remains, elusive, ancyromonads, are, small, free, living, cells, with, a, narrow, longitudinal, groove, down, one, side, of, the, cell, the, ancyromonad, groove, is, not, used, for, suspension, feeding, unlike, in, typical, excavates, e, g, malawimonads, jakobids, trimastix, carpediemonas, kiperferlia, etc, ancyromonads, instead, capture, prokaryotes, attached, to, surfaces, the, phylogenetic, placement, of, ancyromonads, is, poorly, understood, in, 2020, however, some, phylogenetic, analyses, place, them, as, close, relatives, of, malawimonads, the, conventional, explanation, for, the, origin, of, the, eukaryotes, is, that, a, heimdallarchaeian, or, another, archaea, acquired, an, alphaproteobacterium, as, an, endosymbiont, and, that, this, became, the, mitochondrion, the, organelle, providing, oxidative, respiration, to, the, eukaryotic, cell, caesar, al, jewari, and, sandra, baldauf, argue, instead, that, the, eukaryotes, possibly, started, with, an, endosymbiosis, event, of, a, deltaproteobacterium, or, gammaproteobacterium, accounting, for, the, otherwise, unexplained, presence, of, anaerobic, bacterial, enzymes, in, metamonada, the, sister, of, the, preaxostyla, within, metamonada, represents, the, rest, of, the, eukaryotes, which, acquired, an, alphaproteobacterium, in, their, scenario, the, hydrogenosome, and, mitosome, both, conventionally, considered, mitochondrion, derived, organelles, would, predate, the, mitochondrion, and, instead, be, derived, from, the, earlier, symbiotic, bacterium, in, 2023, using, molecular, phylogenetic, analysis, of, 186, taxa, al, jewari, and, baldauf, proposed, a, phylogenetic, tree, with, the, metamonad, parabasalia, as, basal, eukaryotes, discoba, and, the, rest, of, the, eukaryota, appear, to, have, emerged, as, sister, taxon, to, the, preaxostyla, incorporating, a, single, alphaproteobacterium, as, mitochondria, by, endosymbiosis, thus, the, fornicata, are, more, closely, related, to, e, g, animals, than, to, parabasalia, the, rest, of, the, eukaryotes, emerged, within, the, excavata, as, sister, of, the, discoba, as, they, are, within, the, same, clade, but, are, not, cladistically, considered, part, of, the, excavata, yet, the, excavata, are, in, this, analysis, highly, paraphyletic, hodarchaeales, parabasalia, fornicata, preaxostyla, jakobida, heterolobosea, euglenozoa, and, allies, amorphea, inc, animals, fungi, sar, archaeplastida, inc, plants, the, anaeramoeba, are, associated, with, parabasalia, but, could, turn, out, to, be, more, basal, as, the, root, of, a, tree, is, often, difficult, to, pinpoint, metakaryota
