a, blood, test, is, a, laboratory, analysis, performed, on, a, blood, sample, that, is, usually, extracted, from, a, vein, in, the, arm, using, a, hypodermic, needle, or, via, fingerprick, multiple, tests, for, specific, blood, components, such, as, a, glucose, test, or, a, cholesterol, test, are, often, grouped, together, into, one, test, panel, called, a, blood, panel, or, blood, work, blood, tests, are, often, used, in, health, care, to, determine, physiological, and, biochemical, states, such, as, disease, mineral, content, pharmaceutical, drug, effectiveness, and, organ, function, typical, clinical, blood, panels, include, a, basic, metabolic, panel, or, a, complete, blood, count, blood, tests, are, also, used, in, drug, tests, to, detect, drug, abuse, a, venipuncture, is, useful, as, it, is, a, minimally, invasive, way, to, obtain, cells, and, extracellular, fluid, plasma, from, the, body, for, analysis, blood, flows, throughout, the, body, acting, as, a, medium, that, provides, oxygen, and, nutrients, to, tissues, and, carries, waste, products, back, to, the, excretory, systems, for, disposal, consequently, the, state, of, the, bloodstream, affects, or, is, affected, by, many, medical, conditions, for, these, reasons, blood, tests, are, the, most, commonly, performed, medical, tests, if, only, a, few, drops, of, blood, are, needed, a, fingerstick, is, performed, instead, of, a, venipuncture, in, dwelling, arterial, central, venous, and, peripheral, venous, lines, can, also, be, used, to, draw, blood, phlebotomists, laboratory, practitioners, and, nurses, are, those, in, charge, of, extracting, blood, from, a, patient, however, in, special, circumstances, and, or, emergency, situations, paramedics, and, physicians, extract, the, blood, also, respiratory, therapists, are, trained, to, extract, arterial, blood, to, examine, arterial, blood, gases, a, basic, metabolic, panel, measures, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood, urea, nitrogen, bun, magnesium, creatinine, glucose, and, sometimes, calcium, tests, that, focus, on, cholesterol, levels, can, determine, ldl, and, hdl, cholesterol, levels, as, well, as, triglyceride, levels, some, tests, such, as, those, that, measure, glucose, or, a, lipid, profile, require, fasting, or, no, food, consumption, eight, to, twelve, hours, prior, to, the, drawing, of, the, blood, sample, for, the, majority, of, tests, blood, is, usually, obtained, from, the, patient, s, vein, other, specialized, tests, such, as, the, arterial, blood, gas, test, require, blood, extracted, from, an, artery, blood, gas, analysis, of, arterial, blood, is, primarily, used, to, monitor, carbon, dioxide, and, oxygen, levels, related, to, pulmonary, function, but, is, also, used, to, measure, blood, ph, and, bicarbonate, levels, for, certain, metabolic, conditions, while, the, regular, glucose, test, is, taken, at, a, certain, point, in, time, the, glucose, tolerance, test, involves, repeated, testing, to, determine, the, rate, at, which, glucose, is, processed, by, the, body, blood, tests, are, also, used, to, identify, autoimmune, diseases, and, immunoglobulin, e, mediated, food, allergies, see, also, radioallergosorbent, test, 1118, blood, tests, results, should, always, be, interpreted, using, the, ranges, provided, by, the, laboratory, that, performed, the, test, example, ranges, are, shown, below, upon, completion, of, a, blood, test, analysis, patients, may, receive, a, report, with, blood, test, abbreviations, examples, of, common, blood, test, abbreviations, are, shown, below, uk, fbc, uk, full, blood, count, in, 2008, scientists, announced, that, the, more, cost, effective, saliva, testing, could, eventually, replace, some, blood, tests, as, saliva, contains, 20, of, the, proteins, found, in, blood, saliva, testing, may, not, be, appropriate, or, available, for, all, markers, for, example, lipid, levels, cannot, be, measured, with, saliva, testing, in, february, 2011, canadian, researchers, at, the, university, of, calgary, s, schulich, school, of, engineering, announced, a, microchip, for, blood, tests, dubbed, a, microemulsion, a, droplet, of, blood, captured, inside, a, layer, of, another, substance, it, can, control, the, exact, size, and, spacing, of, the, droplets, the, new, test, could, improve, the, efficiency, accuracy, and, speed, of, laboratory, tests, while, also, doing, it, cheaply, in, march, 2011, a, team, of, researchers, from, uc, berkeley, dcu, and, university, of, valpara, so, have, developed, lab, on, a, chip, that, can, diagnose, diseases, within, 10, minutes, without, the, use, of, external, tubing, and, extra, components, it, is, called, self, powered, integrated, microfluidic, blood, analysis, system, simbas, it, uses, tiny, trenches, to, separate, blood, cells, from, plasma, 99, percent, of, blood, cells, were, captured, during, experiments, researchers, used, plastic, components, to, reduce, manufacturing, costs
