see, text, perciformes, p, r, s, f, r, m, i, z, also, called, the, acanthopteri, is, an, order, or, superorder, of, ray, finned, fish, in, the, clade, percomorpha, perciformes, means, perch, like, among, the, well, known, members, of, this, group, are, perch, and, darters, percidae, sea, bass, and, groupers, serranidae, formerly, this, group, was, thought, to, be, even, more, diverse, than, it, is, thought, to, be, now, containing, about, 41, of, all, bony, fish, about, 10, 000, species, and, about, 160, families, which, is, the, most, of, any, order, within, the, vertebrates, however, many, of, these, other, families, have, since, been, reclassified, within, their, own, orders, within, the, clade, percomorpha, significantly, reducing, the, size, of, the, group, in, contrast, to, this, splitting, other, groups, formerly, considered, distinct, such, as, the, scorpaeniformes, are, now, classified, in, the, perciformes, the, earliest, fossil, perciform, is, the, extinct, serranid, paleoserranus, from, the, early, paleocene, of, mexico, but, potential, records, of, percoids, are, known, from, the, maastrichtian, including, eoserranus, indiaichthys, and, prolates, although, their, exact, taxonomic, identity, remains, uncertain, the, dorsal, and, anal, fins, are, divided, into, anterior, spiny, and, posterior, soft, rayed, portions, which, may, be, partially, or, completely, separated, the, pelvic, fins, usually, have, one, spine, and, up, to, five, soft, rays, positioned, unusually, far, forward, under, the, chin, or, under, the, belly, scales, are, usually, ctenoid, rough, to, the, touch, although, sometimes, they, are, cycloid, smooth, to, the, touch, or, otherwise, modified, classification, of, this, group, is, controversial, as, traditionally, defined, before, the, introduction, of, cladistics, the, perciformes, are, almost, certainly, paraphyletic, other, orders, that, should, possibly, be, included, as, suborders, are, the, scorpaeniformes, tetraodontiformes, and, pleuronectiformes, of, the, presently, recognized, suborders, several, may, be, paraphyletic, as, well, these, are, grouped, by, suborder, superfamily, generally, following, the, text, fishes, of, the, world
