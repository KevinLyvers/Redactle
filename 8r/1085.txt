originated, around, the, 6th, millennium, bce, in, the, region, of, what, is, now, yunnan, province, in, southwestern, china, the, name, buckwheat, is, used, for, several, other, species, such, as, fagopyrum, tataricum, a, domesticated, food, plant, raised, in, asia, despite, its, name, buckwheat, is, not, closely, related, to, wheat, buckwheat, is, not, a, cereal, nor, is, it, even, a, member, of, the, grass, family, it, is, related, to, sorrel, knotweed, and, rhubarb, buckwheat, is, considered, a, pseudocereal, because, its, seeds, high, starch, content, allows, them, to, be, used, in, cooking, like, a, cereal, the, name, buckwheat, or, beech, wheat, comes, from, its, tetrahedral, seeds, which, resemble, the, much, larger, seeds, of, the, beech, nut, from, the, beech, tree, and, the, fact, that, it, is, used, like, wheat, the, word, may, be, a, translation, of, middle, dutch, boecweite, boec, beech, modern, dutch, beuk, see, pie, bhago, and, weite, wheat, mod, dut, tarwe, antiquated, weit, or, maybe, a, native, formation, on, the, same, model, as, the, dutch, word, buckwheat, is, a, herbaceous, annual, flowering, plant, growing, to, about, 60, centimetres, 24, in, with, red, stems, and, pink, and, white, flowers, resembling, those, of, knotweeds, 68, the, leaves, are, arrow, shaped, and, the, fruits, are, achenes, about, 5, 7, mm, with, 3, prominent, sharp, angles, 94, fagopyrum, esculentum, is, native, to, south, central, china, and, tibet, and, has, been, introduced, into, suitable, climates, across, eurasia, africa, and, the, americas, the, wild, ancestor, of, common, buckwheat, is, f, esculentum, ssp, ancestrale, f, homotropicum, is, interfertile, with, f, esculentum, and, the, wild, forms, have, a, common, distribution, in, yunnan, a, southwestern, province, of, china, the, wild, ancestor, of, tartary, buckwheat, is, f, tataricum, ssp, potanini, common, buckwheat, was, domesticated, and, first, cultivated, in, inland, southeast, asia, possibly, around, 6000, bce, and, from, there, spread, to, central, asia, and, tibet, and, then, to, the, middle, east, and, europe, which, it, reached, by, the, 15th, century, domestication, most, likely, took, place, in, the, western, yunnan, region, of, china, the, oldest, remains, found, in, china, so, far, date, to, circa, 2600, bce, while, buckwheat, pollen, found, in, japan, dates, from, as, early, as, 4000, bce, it, is, the, world, s, highest, elevation, domesticate, being, cultivated, in, yunnan, on, the, edge, of, the, tibetan, plateau, or, on, the, plateau, itself, buckwheat, was, one, of, the, earliest, crops, introduced, by, europeans, to, north, america, dispersal, around, the, globe, was, complete, by, 2006, when, a, variety, developed, in, canada, was, widely, planted, in, china, in, india, buckwheat, flour, is, known, as, kuttu, ka, atta, and, has, long, been, culturally, associated, with, many, festivals, like, shivratri, navaratri, and, janmashtami, on, the, day, of, these, festivals, food, items, made, only, from, buckwheat, are, consumed, buckwheat, is, a, short, season, crop, that, grows, well, in, low, fertility, or, acidic, soils, too, much, fertilizer, especially, nitrogen, reduces, yields, and, the, soil, must, be, well, drained, in, hot, climates, buckwheat, can, be, grown, only, by, sowing, late, in, the, season, so, that, it, blooms, in, cooler, weather, the, presence, of, pollinators, greatly, increases, yield, nectar, from, flowering, buckwheat, produces, a, dark, colored, honey, the, buckwheat, plant, has, a, branching, root, system, with, a, primary, taproot, that, reaches, deeply, into, moist, soil, it, grows, 75, to, 125, centimetres, 30, to, 50, inches, tall, buckwheat, has, tetrahedral, seeds, and, produces, a, flower, that, is, usually, white, although, can, also, be, pink, or, yellow, buckwheat, branches, freely, as, opposed, to, tillering, or, producing, suckers, enabling, more, complete, adaption, to, its, environment, than, other, cereal, crops, buckwheat, is, raised, for, grain, only, where, a, brief, time, is, available, for, growth, either, because, the, buckwheat, is, an, early, or, a, second, crop, in, the, season, or, because, the, total, growing, season, is, limited, it, establishes, quickly, which, suppresses, summer, weeds, and, can, be, a, reliable, cover, crop, in, summer, to, fit, a, small, slot, of, warm, season, buckwheat, has, a, growing, period, of, only, 10, 12, weeks, and, it, can, be, grown, in, high, latitude, or, northern, areas, buckwheat, is, sometimes, used, as, a, green, manure, as, a, plant, for, erosion, control, or, as, wildlife, cover, and, feed, in, 2022, world, production, of, buckwheat, was, 2, 2, million, tonnes, led, by, russia, with, 55, of, the, world, total, followed, by, china, with, 23, and, ukraine, with, 7, f, esculentum, is, often, studied, and, used, as, a, pollen, and, nectar, source, to, increase, natural, predator, numbers, to, control, crop, pests, berndt, et, al, 2002, found, that, the, results, were, not, entirely, promising, in, one, vineyard, in, new, zealand, but, the, same, team, berndt, et, al, 2006, four, years, later, and, studying, a, number, of, vineyards, up, and, down, new, zealand, did, find, a, significant, increase, in, 22, parasitoids, especially, dolichogenidea, tasmanica, as, did, irvin, et, al, 1999, for, d, t, in, canterbury, orchards, gurr, et, al, 1998, showed, that, floral, nectaries, and, not, shelter, in, or, alternate, hosts, on, f, esculentum, were, responsible, for, this, increase, and, stephens, et, al, 1998, for, anacharis, spp, on, micromus, tasmaniae, stephens, et, al, 1998, also, first, demonstrated, a, great, increase, of, a, spp, on, m, t, which, also, commonly, predates, on, f, e, cullen, et, al, 2013, found, that, vineyards, around, waipara, had, not, continued, planting, buckwheat, suggesting, a, need, for, further, technique, development, so, that, buckwheat, will, integrate, well, with, real, world, vineyard, practice, english, loeb, et, al, 2003, found, that, it, does, sustain, greater, numbers, of, anagrus, parasitoids, on, erythroneura, leafhoppers, and, balzan, and, w, ckers, 2013, found, the, same, for, necremnus, artynes, and, ferracini, et, al, 2012, for, necremnus, tutae, on, tuta, absoluta, and, thereby, act, as, pest, controls, in, tomato, potato, and, to, a, lesser, degree, other, solanaceous, and, non, solanaceous, horticulturals, kalinova, and, moudry, 2003, found, that, further, companion, planting, with, other, flowers, at, the, wrong, time, of, year, may, actually, cause, f, esculentum, to, be, killed, by, frosts, it, would, have, otherwise, survived, and, colley, and, luna, 2000, found, that, it, may, delay, its, flowering, to, not, coincide, with, the, natural, enemy, it, was, planted, to, feed, foti, et, al, 2016, found, significant, short, chain, carboxylic, acid, variation, to, be, the, most, likely, explanation, for, biocontrol, performance, variation, between, cultivars, buckwheat, contains, diverse, phytochemicals, including, rutin, tannins, catechin, 7, o, glucoside, in, groats, and, fagopyrins, which, are, located, mainly, in, the, cotyledons, of, the, buckwheat, plant, it, has, almost, no, levels, of, inorganic, arsenic, salicylaldehyde, 2, hydroxybenzaldehyde, was,

decanal, and, hexanal, also, contribute, to, its, aroma, they, all, have, odour, activity, value, of, more, than, 50, but, the, aroma, of, these, substances, in, an, isolated, state, does, not, resemble, buckwheat, with, a, 100, gram, serving, of, dry, buckwheat, providing, 1, 440, kilojoules, 343, kilocalories, of, food, energy, or, 380, kj, 92, kcal, cooked, buckwheat, is, a, rich, source,
