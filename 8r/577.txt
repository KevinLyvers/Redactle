the, tuatara, sphenodon, punctatus, is, a, species, of, reptile, endemic, to, new, zealand, despite, its, close, resemblance, to, lizards, it, is, part, of, a, distinct, lineage, the, order, rhynchocephalia, the, name, tuatara, is, derived, from, the, m, ori, language, and, means, peaks, on, the, back, the, single, extant, species, of, tuatara, is, the, only, surviving, member, of, its, order, which, was, highly, diverse, during, the, mesozoic, era, rhynchocephalians, first, appeared, in, the, fossil, record, during, the, triassic, around, 240, million, years, ago, and, reached, worldwide, distribution, and, peak, diversity, during, the, jurassic, when, they, represented, the, world, s, dominant, group, of, small, reptiles, rhynchocephalians, underwent, a, great, decline, during, the, cretaceous, with, their, youngest, records, outside, new, zealand, dating, to, the, paleocene, their, closest, living, relatives, are, squamates, lizards, and, snakes, tuatara, are, of, interest, for, studying, the, evolution, of, reptiles, tuatara, are, greenish, brown, and, grey, and, measure, up, to, 80, cm, 31, in, from, head, to, tail, tip, and, weigh, up, to, 1, 3, kg, 2, 9, lb, with, a, spiny, crest, along, the, back, especially, pronounced, in, males, they, have, two, rows, of, teeth, in, the, upper, jaw, overlapping, one, row, on, the, lower, jaw, which, is, unique, among, living, species, they, are, able, to, hear, although, no, external, ear, is, present, and, have, unique, features, in, their, skeleton, tuatara, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, living, fossils, which, has, generated, significant, scientific, debate, this, term, is, currently, deprecated, among, paleontologists, and, evolutionary, biologists, although, tuatara, have, preserved, the, morphological, characteristics, of, their, mesozoic, ancestors, 240, 230, million, years, ago, there, is, no, evidence, of, a, continuous, fossil, record, to, support, this, the, species, has, between, 5, and, 6, billion, base, pairs, of, dna, sequence, nearly, twice, that, of, humans, the, tuatara, sphenodon, punctatus, has, been, protected, by, law, since, 1895, a, second, species, the, brothers, island, tuatara, s, guntheri, buller, 1877, was, recognised, in, 1989, but, since, 2009, it, has, been, reclassified, as, a, subspecies, s, p, guntheri, tuatara, like, many, of, new, zealand, s, native, animals, are, threatened, by, habitat, loss, and, introduced, predators, such, as, the, polynesian, rat, rattus, exulans, tuatara, were, extinct, on, the, mainland, with, the, remaining, populations, confined, to, 32, offshore, islands, until, the, first, north, island, release, into, the, heavily, fenced, and, monitored, karori, wildlife, sanctuary, now, named, zealandia, in, 2005, during, routine, maintenance, work, at, zealandia, in, late, 2008, a, tuatara, nest, was, uncovered, with, a, hatchling, found, the, following, autumn, this, is, thought, to, be, the, first, case, of, tuatara, successfully, breeding, in, the, wild, on, new, zealand, s, north, island, in, over, 200, years, relationships, of, the, tuatara, to, other, living, reptiles, and, birds, after, sim, es, et, al, 2022, squamata, lizards, and, snakes, rhynchocephalia, tuatara, testudines, turtles, including, tortoises, crocodilia, crocodilians, aves, birds, tuatara, along, with, other, now, extinct, members, of, the, order, rhynchocephalia, belong, to, the, superorder, lepidosauria, the, only, surviving, taxon, within, lepidosauromorpha, along, with, the, order, squamata, which, includes, lizards, and, snakes, squamates, and, tuatara, both, show, caudal, autotomy, loss, of, the, tail, tip, when, threatened, and, have, transverse, cloacal, slits, tuatara, were, originally, classified, as, lizards, in, 1831, when, the, british, museum, received, a, skull, the, genus, remained, misclassified, until, 1867, when, a, c, l, g, g, nther, of, the, british, museum, noted, features, similar, to, birds, turtles, and, crocodiles, he, proposed, the, order, rhynchocephalia, meaning, beak, head, for, the, tuatara, and, its, fossil, relatives, at, one, point, many, disparate, species, were, incorrectly, referred, to, the, rhynchocephalia, resulting, in, what, taxonomists, call, a, wastebasket, taxon, williston, proposed, the, sphenodontia, to, include, only, tuatara, and, their, closest, fossil, relatives, in, 1925, however, rhynchocephalia, is, the, older, name, and, in, widespread, use, today, sphenodon, is, derived, from, the, greek, for, wedge, sphenos, and, tooth, odontos, many, scholars, use, sphenodontia, as, a, subset, of, rhynchocephalia, including, almost, all, members, of, rhynchocephalia, apart, from, the, most, primitive, representatives, of, the, group, the, earliest, rhynchocephalian, wirtembergia, is, known, from, the, middle, triassic, of, germany, around, 240, million, years, ago, during, the, late, triassic, rhynchocephalians, greatly, diversified, going, on, to, become, the, world, s, dominant, group, of, small, reptiles, during, the, jurassic, period, when, the, group, was, represented, by, a, diversity, of, forms, including, the, aquatic, pleurosaurs, and, the, herbivorous, eilenodontines, the, earliest, members, of, sphenodontinae, the, clade, which, includes, the, tuatara, are, known, from, the, early, jurassic, of, north, america, the, earliest, representatives, of, this, group, are, already, very, similar, to, the, modern, tuatara, rhynchocephalians, underwent, a, great, decline, during, the, cretaceous, period, possibly, due, to, competition, with, mammals, and, lizards, with, their, youngest, record, outside, of, new, zealand, being, of, kawasphenodon, known, from, the, paleocene, of, patagonia, in, south, america, a, species, of, sphenodontine, is, known, from, the, miocene, saint, bathans, fauna, from, otago, in, the, south, island, of, new, zealand, whether, it, is, referable, to, sphenodon, proper, is, not, entirely, clear, but, it, is, likely, to, be, closely, related, to, tuatara, the, ancestors, of, the, tuatara, were, likely, already, present, in, new, zealand, prior, to, its, separation, from, antarctica, around, 82, 60, million, years, ago, cladogram, of, the, position, of, the, tuatara, within, sphenodontia, after, simoes, et, al, 2022, diphydontosaurus, planocephalosaurus,

navajosphenodon, cynosphenodon, sphenofontis, kawasphenodon, sphenodon, tuatara, while, there, is, currently, considered, to, be, only, one, living, species, of, tuatara, two, species, were, previously, identified, sphenodon, punctatus, or, northern, tuatara, and, the, much, rarer, sphenodon, guntheri, or, brothers, island, tuatara, which, is, confined, to, north, brother, island, in, cook, strait, the, specific, name, punctatus, is, latin, for, spotted, and, guntheri, refers, to, german, born, british, herpetologist, albert, g, nther, a, 2009, paper, re, examined, the, genetic, bases, used, to, distinguish, the, two, supposed, species, of, tuatara, and, concluded, they, only, represent, geographic, variants, and, only, one, species, should, be, recognized, consequently, the, northern, tuatara, was, re, classified, as, sphenodon, punctatus, punctatus, and, the, brothers, island, tuatara, as, sphenodon, punctatus, guntheri, individuals, from, brothers, island, could, also, not, be, distinguished, from, other, modern, and, fossil, samples, based, on, jaw, morphology, the, brothers, island, tuatara, has, olive, brown, skin, with, yellowish, patches, while, the, colour, of, the, northern, tuatara, ranges, from, olive, green, through, grey, to, dark, pink, or, brick, red, often, mottled, and, always, with, white, spots, in, addition, the, brothers, island, tuatara, is, considerably, smaller, an, extinct, species, of, sphenodon, was, identified, in, november, 1885, by, william, colenso, who, was, sent, an, incomplete, subfossil, specimen, from, a, local, coal, mine, colenso, named, the, new, species, s, diversum, fawcett, and, smith, 1970, consider, it, a, synonym, to, the, subspecies, based, on, a, lack, of, distinction, tuatara, are, the, largest, reptiles, in, new, zealand, adult, s, punctatus, males, measure, 61, cm, 24, in, in, length, and, females, 45, cm, 18, in, tuatara, are, sexually, dimorphic, males, being, larger, the, san, diego, zoo, even, cites, a, length, of, up, to, 80, cm, 31, in, males, weigh, up, to, 1, kg, 2, 2, lb, and, females, up, to, 0, 5, kg, 1, 1, lb, brother, s, island, tuatara, are, slightly, smaller, weighing, up, to, 660, g, 1, 3, lb, their, lungs, have, a, single, chamber, with, no, bronchi, the, tuatara, s, greenish, brown, colour, matches, its, environment, and, can, change, over, its, lifetime, tuatara, shed, their, skin, at, least, once, per, year, as, adults, and, three, or, four, times, a, year, as, juveniles, tuatara, sexes, differ, in, more, than, size, the, spiny, crest, on, a, tuatara, s, back, made, of, triangular, soft, folds, of, skin, is, larger, in, males, and, can, be, stiffened, for, display, the, male, abdomen, is, narrower, than, the, female, s, unlike, the, vast, majority, of, lizards, the, tuatara, has, a, complete, lower, temporal, bar, closing, the, lower, temporal, fenestra, an, opening, of, the, skull, behind, the, eye, socket, caused, by, the, fusion, of, the, quadrate, quadratojugal, which, are, fused, into, a, single, element, in, adult, tuatara, and, the, jugal, bones, of, the, skull, this, is, similar, to, the, condition, found, in, primitive, diapsid, reptiles, however, because, more, primitive, rhynchocephalians, have, an, open, lower, temporal, fenestra, with, an, incomplete, temporal, bar, this, is, thought, to, be, derived, characteristic, of, the, tuatara, and, other, members, of, the, clade, sphenodontinae, rather, than, a, primitive, trait, retained, from, early, diapsids, the, complete, bar, is, thought, to, stabilise, the, skull, during, biting, the, tip, of, the, upper, jaw, is, chisel, or, beak, like, and, separated, from, the, remainder, of, the, jaw, by, a, notch, this, structure, is, formed, from, fused, premaxillary, teeth, and, is, also, found, in, many, other, advanced, rhynchocephalians, the, teeth, of, the, tuatara, and, almost, all, other, rhynchocephalians, are, described, as, acrodont, as, they, are, attached, to, the, apex, of, the, jaw, bone, this, contrast, with, the, pleurodont, condition, found, in, the, vast, majority, of, lizards, where, the, teeth, are, attached, to, the, inward, facing, surface, of, the, jaw, the, teeth, of, the, tuatara, are, extensively, fused, to, the, jawbone, making, the, boundary, between, the, tooth, and, jaw, difficult, to, discern, and, the, teeth, lack, roots, and, are, not, replaced, during, the, lifetime, of, the, animal, unlike, those, of, pleurodont, lizards, it, is, a, common, misconception, that, tuatara, lack, teeth, and, instead, have, sharp, projections, on, the, jaw, bone, though, histology, shows, that, they, have, true, teeth, with, enamel, and, dentine, with, pulp, cavities, as, their, teeth, wear, down, older, tuatara, have, to, switch, to, softer, prey, such, as, earthworms, larvae, and, slugs, and, eventually, have, to, chew, their, food, between, smooth, jaw, bones, the, tuatara, possesses, palatal, dentition, teeth, growing, from, the, bones, of, the, roof, of, the, mouth, which, is, ancestrally, present, in, reptiles, and, tetrapods, generally, while, many, of, the, original, palatal, teeth, present, in, reptiles, have, been, lost, like, all, other, known, rhynchocephalians, the, row, of, teeth, growing, from, the, palatine, bones, have, been, enlarged, and, like, other, members, of, sphenodontinae, the, palatine, teeth, are, orientated, parallel, to, the, teeth, in, the, maxilla, and, during, biting, the, teeth, of, the, lower, jaw, slot, between, the, two, upper, tooth, rows, the, structure, of, the, jaw, joint, allows, the, lower, jaw, to, slide, forwards, after, it, has, closed, between, the, two, upper, rows, of, teeth, this, mechanism, allows, the, jaws, to, shear, through, chitin, and, bone, the, brain, of, sphenodon, fills, only, half, of, the, volume, of, its, endocranium, this, proportion, has, actually, been, used, by, paleontologists, trying, to, estimate, the, volume, of, dinosaur, brains, based, on, fossils, however, the, proportion, of, the, tuatara, endocranium, occupied, by, its, brain, may, not, be, a, very, good, guide, to, the, same, proportion, in, mesozoic, dinosaurs, since, modern, birds, are, surviving, dinosaurs, but, have, brains, which, occupy, a, much, greater, relative, volume, in, the, endocranium, the, eyes, can, focus, independently, and, are, specialised, with, three, types, of, photoreceptive, cells, all, with, fine, structural, characteristics, of, retinal, cone, cells, used, for, both, day, and, night, vision, and, a, tapetum, lucidum, which, reflects, onto, the, retina, to, enhance, vision, in, the, dark, there, is, also, a, third, eyelid, on, each, eye, the, nictitating, membrane, five, visual, opsin, genes, are, present, suggesting, good, colour, vision, possibly, even, at, low, light, levels, like, some, other, living, vertebrates, including, some, lizards, the, tuatara, has, a, third, eye, on, the, top, of, its, head, called, the, parietal, eye, also, called, a, pineal, or, third, eye, formed, by, the, parapineal, organ, with, an, accompanying, opening, in, the, skull, roof, called, the, pineal, or, parietal, foramen, enclosed, by, the, parietal, bones, it, has, its, own, lens, a, parietal, plug, which, resembles, a, cornea, retina, with, rod, like, structures, and, degenerated, nerve, connection, to, the, brain, the, parietal, eye, is, visible, only, in, hatchlings, which, have, a, translucent, patch, at, the, top, centre, of, the, skull, after, four, to, six, months, it, becomes, covered, with, opaque, scales, and, pigment, it, likely, serves, to, regulate, the, circadian, rhythm, and, possibly, detect, seasonal, changes, and, help, with, thermoregulation, of, all, extant, tetrapods, the, parietal, eye, is, most, pronounced, in, the, tuatara, it, is, part, of, the, pineal, complex, another, part, of, which, is, the, pineal, gland, which, in, tuatara, secretes, melatonin, at, night, some, salamanders, have, been, shown, to, use, their, pineal, bodies, to, perceive, polarised, light, and, thus, determine, the, position, of, the, sun, even, under, cloud, cover, aiding, navigation, together, with, turtles, the, tuatara, has, the, most, primitive, hearing, organs, among, the, amniotes, there, is, no, tympanum, eardrum, and, no, earhole, and, the, middle, ear, cavity, is, filled, with, loose, tissue, mostly, adipose, fatty, tissue, the, stapes, comes, into, contact, with, the, quadrate, which, is, immovable, as, well, as, the, hyoid, and, squamosal, the, hair, cells, are, unspecialised, innervated, by, both, afferent, and, efferent, nerve, fibres, and, respond, only, to, low, frequencies, though, the, hearing, organs, are, poorly, developed, and, primitive, with, no, visible, external, ears, they, can, still, show, a, frequency, response, from, 100, to, 800, hz, with, peak, sensitivity, of, 40, db, at, 200, hz, animals, that, depend, on, the, sense, of, smell, to, capture, prey, escape, from, predators, or, simply, interact, with, the, environment, they, inhabit, usually, have, many, odorant, receptors, these, receptors, are, expressed, in, the, dendritic, membranes, of, the, neurons, for, the, detection, of, odours, the, tuatara, has, several, hundred, receptors, around, 472, a, number, more, similar, to, what, birds, have, than, to, the, large, number, of, receptors, that, turtles, and, crocodiles, may, have, the, tuatara, spine, is, made, up, of, hourglass, shaped, amphicoelous, vertebrae, concave, both, before, and, behind, this, is, the, usual, condition, of, fish, vertebrae, and, some, amphibians, but, is, unique, to, tuatara, within, the, amniotes, the, vertebral, bodies, have, a, tiny, hole, through, which, a, constricted, remnant, of, the, notochord, passes, this, was, typical, in, early, fossil, reptiles, but, lost, in, most, other, amniotes, the, tuatara, has, gastralia, rib, like, bones, also, called, gastric, or, abdominal, ribs, the, presumed, ancestral, trait, of, diapsids, they, are, found, in, some, lizards, where, they, are, mostly, made, of, cartilage, as, well, as, crocodiles, and, the, tuatara, and, are, not, attached, to, the, spine, or, thoracic, ribs, the, true, ribs, are, small, projections, with, small, hooked, bones, called, uncinate, processes, found, on, the, rear, of, each, rib, this, feature, is, also, present, in, birds, the, tuatara, is, the, only, living, tetrapod, with, well, developed, gastralia, and, uncinate, processes, in, the, early, tetrapods, the, gastralia, and, ribs, with, uncinate, processes, together, with, bony, elements, such, as, bony, plates, in, the, skin, osteoderms, and, clavicles, collar, bone, would, have, formed, a, sort, of, exoskeleton, around, the, body, protecting, the, belly, and, helping, to, hold, in, the, guts, and, inner, organs, these, anatomical, details, most, likely, evolved, from, structures, involved, in, locomotion, even, before, the, vertebrates, ventured, onto, land, the, gastralia, may, have, been, involved, in, the, breathing, process, in, early, amphibians, and, reptiles, the, pelvis, and, shoulder, girdles, are, arranged, differently, from, those, of, lizards, as, is, the, case, with, other, parts, of, the, internal, anatomy, and, its, scales, the, spiny, plates, on, the, back, and, tail, of, the, tuatara, resemble, those, of, a, crocodile, more, than, a, lizard, but, the, tuatara, shares, with, lizards, the, ability, to, break, off, its, tail, when, caught, by, a, predator, and, then, regenerate, it, the, regrowth, takes, a, long, time, and, differs, from, that, of, lizards, well, illustrated, reports, on, tail, regeneration, in, tuatara, have, been, published, by, alibardi, and, meyer, rochow, the, cloacal, glands, of, tuatara, have, a, unique, organic, compound, named, tuataric, acid, currently, there, are, two, means, of, determining, the, age, of, tuatara, using, microscopic, inspection, hematoxylinophilic, rings, can, be, identified, and, counted, in, both, the, phalanges, and, the, femur, phalangeal, hematoxylinophilic, rings, can, be, used, for, tuatara, up, to, ages, 12, 14, years, as, they, cease, to, form, around, this, age, femoral, rings, follow, a, similar, trend, however, they, are, useful, for, tuatara, up, to, ages, 25, 35, years, around, that, age, femoral, rings, cease, to, form, further, research, on, age, determination, methods, for, tuatara, is, required, as, tuatara, have, lifespans, much, longer, than, 35, years, ages, up, to, 60, are, common, and, captive, tuatara, have, lived, to, over, 100, years, one, possibility, could, be, via, examination, of, tooth, wear, as, tuatara, have, fused, sets, of, teeth, adult, tuatara, are, terrestrial, and, nocturnal, reptiles, though, they, will, often, bask, in, the, sun, to, warm, their, bodies, hatchlings, hide, under, logs, and, stones, and, are, diurnal, likely, because, adults, are, cannibalistic, juveniles, are, typically, active, at, night, but, can, be, found, active, during, the, day, the, juveniles, movement, pattern, is, attributed, to, genetic, hardwire, of, conspecifics, for, predator, avoidance, and, thermal, restrictions, tuatara, thrive, in, temperatures, much, lower, than, those, tolerated, by, most, reptiles, and, hibernate, during, winter, they, remain, active, at, temperatures, as, low, as, 5, c, 41, f, while, temperatures, over, 28, c, 82, f, are, generally, fatal, the, optimal, body, temperature, for, the, tuatara, is, from, 16, to, 21, c, 61, to, 70, f, the, lowest, of, any, reptile, the, body, temperature, of, tuatara, is, lower, than, that, of, other, reptiles, ranging, from, 5, 2, 11, 2, c, 41, 4, 52, 2, f, over, a, day, whereas, most, reptiles, have, body, temperatures, around, 20, c, 68, f, the, low, body, temperature, results, in, a, slower, metabolism, burrowing, seabirds, such, as, petrels, prions, and, shearwaters, share, the, tuatara, s, island, habitat, during, the, birds, nesting, seasons, the, tuatara, use, the, birds, burrows, for, shelter, when, available, or, dig, their, own, the, seabirds, guano, helps, to, maintain, invertebrate, populations, on, which, tuatara, predominantly, prey, including, beetles, crickets, spiders, w, t, s, earthworms, and, snails, their, diets, also, consist, of, frogs, lizards, and, bird, s, eggs, and, chicks, young, tuatara, are, also, occasionally, cannibalized, the, diet, of, the, tuatara, varies, seasonally, and, they, mainly, only, consume, fairy, prions, and, their, eggs, in, the, summer, in, total, darkness, no, feeding, attempt, whatsoever, was, observed, and, the, lowest, light, intensity, at, which, an, attempt, to, snatch, a, beetle, was, observed, occurred, under, 0, 0125, lux, the, eggs, and, young, of, seabirds, that, are, seasonally, available, as, food, for, tuatara, may, provide, beneficial, fatty, acids, tuatara, of, both, sexes, defend, territories, and, will, threaten, and, eventually, bite, intruders, the, bite, can, cause, serious, injury, tuatara, will, bite, when, approached, and, will, not, let, go, easily, female, tuatara, rarely, exhibit, parental, behaviour, by, guarding, nests, on, islands, with, high, rodent, populations, tuataras, are, parasitised, by, the, tuatara, tick, archaeocroton, sphenodonti, a, tick, that, directly, depends, on, tuataras, these, ticks, tend, to, be, more, prevalent, on, larger, males, as, they, have, larger, home, ranges, than, smaller, and, female, tuatara, and, interact, with, other, tuatara, more, in, territorial, displays, tuatara, reproduce, very, slowly, taking, 10, to, 20, years, to, reach, sexual, maturity, though, their, reproduction, rate, is, slow, tuatara, have, the, fastest, swimming, sperm, by, two, to, four, times, compared, to, all, reptiles, studied, earlier, mating, occurs, in, midsummer, females, mate, and, lay, eggs, once, every, four, years, during, courtship, a, male, makes, his, skin, darker, raises, his, crests, and, parades, toward, the, female, he, slowly, walks, in, circles, around, the, female, with, stiffened, legs, the, female, will, either, allow, the, male, to, mount, her, or, retreat, to, her, burrow, males, do, not, have, a, penis, they, have, rudimentary, hemipenes, meaning, that, intromittent, organs, are, used, to, deliver, sperm, to, the, female, during, copulation, they, reproduce, by, the, male, lifting, the, tail, of, the, female, and, placing, his, vent, over, hers, this, process, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, cloacal, kiss, the, sperm, is, then, transferred, into, the, female, much, like, the, mating, process, in, birds, along, with, birds, the, tuatara, is, one, of, the, few, members, of, amniota, to, have, lost, the, ancestral, penis, tuatara, eggs, have, a, soft, parchment, like, 0, 2, mm, thick, shell, that, consists, of, calcite, crystals, embedded, in, a, matrix, of, fibrous, layers, it, takes, the, females, between, one, and, three, years, to, provide, eggs, with, yolk, and, up, to, seven, months, to, form, the, shell, it, then, takes, between, 12, and, 15, months, from, copulation, to, hatching, this, means, reproduction, occurs, at, two, to, five, year, intervals, the, slowest, in, any, reptile, survival, of, embryos, has, also, been, linked, to, having, more, success, in, moist, conditions, wild, tuatara, are, known, to, be, still, reproducing, at, about, 60, years, of, age, henry, a, male, tuatara, at, southland, museum, in, invercargill, new, zealand, became, a, father, possibly, for, the, first, time, on, 23, january, 2009, at, age, 111, with, an, 80, year, old, female, the, sex, of, a, hatchling, depends, on, the, temperature, of, the, egg, with, warmer, eggs, tending, to, produce, male, tuatara, and, cooler, eggs, producing, females, eggs, incubated, at, 21, c, 70, f, have, an, equal, chance, of, being, male, or, female, however, at, 22, c, 72, f, 80, are, likely, to, be, males, and, at, 20, c, 68, f, 80, are, likely, to, be, females, at, 18, c, 64, f, all, hatchlings, will, be, females, some, evidence, indicates, sex, determination, in, tuatara, is, determined, by, both, genetic, and, environmental, factors, tuatara, probably, have, the, slowest, growth, rates, of, any, reptile, continuing, to, grow, larger, for, the, first, 35, years, of, their, lives, the, average, lifespan, is, about, 60, years, but, they, can, live, to, be, well, over, 100, years, old, tuatara, could, be, the, reptile, with, the, second, longest, lifespan, after, tortoises, some, experts, believe, that, captive, tuatara, could, live, as, long, as, 200, years, this, may, be, related, to, genes, that, offer, protection, against, reactive, oxygen, species, the, tuatara, genome, has, 26, genes, that, encode, selenoproteins, and, 4, selenocysteine, specific, trna, genes, in, humans, selenoproteins, have, a, function, of, antioxidation, redox, regulation, and, synthesis, of, thyroid, hormones, it, is, not, fully, demonstrated, but, these, genes, may, be, related, to, the, longevity, of, this, animal, or, may, have, emerged, as, a, result, of, the, low, levels, of, selenium, and, other, trace, elements, in, the, new, zealand, terrestrial, systems, the, most, abundant, line, element, in, the, tuatara, is, l2, 10, most, of, them, are, interspersed, and, can, remain, active, the, longest, l2, element, found, is, 4, kb, long, and, 83, of, the, sequences, had, orf2p, completely, intact, the, cr1, element, is, the, second, most, repeated, 4, phylogenetic, analysis, shows, that, these, sequences, are, very, different, from, those, found, in, other, nearby, species, such, as, lizards, finally, less, than, 1, are, elements, belonging, to, l1, a, low, percentage, since, these, elements, tend, to, predominate, in, placental, mammals, usually, the, predominant, line, elements, are, the, cr1, contrary, to, what, has, been, seen, in, the, tuatara, this, suggests, that, perhaps, the, genome, repeats, of, sauropsids, were, very, different, compared, to, mammals, birds, and, lizards, the, genes, of, the, major, histocompatibility, complex, mhc, are, known, to, play, roles, in, disease, resistance, mate, choice, and, kin, recognition, in, various, vertebrate, species, among, known, vertebrate, genomes, mhcs, are, considered, one, of, the, most, polymorphic, in, the, tuatara, 56, mhc, genes, have, been, identified, some, of, which, are, similar, to, mhcs, of, amphibians, and, mammals, most, mhcs, that, were, annotated, in, the, tuatara, genome, are, highly, conserved, however, there, is, large, genomic, rearrangement, observed, in, distant, lepidosauria, lineages, many, of, the, elements, that, have, been, analyzed, are, present, in, all, amniotes, most, are, mammalian, interspersed, repeats, or, mir, specifically, the, diversity, of, mir, subfamilies, is, the, highest, that, has, been, studied, so, far, in, an, amniote, 16, families, of, sines, that, were, recently, active, have, also, been, identified, the, tuatara, has, 24, unique, families, of, dna, transposons, and, at, least, 30, subfamilies, were, recently, active, this, diversity, is, greater, than, what, has, been, found, in, other, amniotes, and, in, addition, thousands, of, identical, copies, of, these, transposons, have, been, analyzed, suggesting, to, researchers, that, there, is, recent, activity, the, genome, is, the, second, largest, known, to, reptiles, only, the, greek, tortoise, genome, is, larger, around, 7, 500, ltrs, have, been, identified, including, 450, endogenous, retroviruses, ervs, studies, in, other, sauropsida, have, recognized, a, similar, number, but, nevertheless, in, the, genome, of, the, tuatara, it, has, been, found, a, very, old, clade, of, retrovirus, known, as, spumavirus, more, than, 8, 000, non, coding, rna, related, elements, have, been, identified, in, the, tuatara, genome, of, which, the, vast, majority, about, 6, 900, are, derived, from, recently, active, transposable, elements, the, rest, are, related, to, ribosomal, spliceosomal, and, signal, recognition, particle, rna, the, mitochondrial, genome, of, the, genus, sphenodon, is, approximately, 18, 000, bp, in, size, and, consists, of, 13, protein, coding, genes, 2, ribosomal, rna, and, 22, transfer, rna, genes, dna, methylation, is, a, very, common, modification, in, animals, and, the, distribution, of, cpg, sites, within, genomes, affects, this, methylation, specifically, 81, of, these, cpg, sites, have, been, found, to, be, methylated, in, the, tuatara, genome, recent, publications, propose, that, this, high, level, of, methylation, may, be, due, to, the, amount, of, repeating, elements, that, exist, in, the, genome, of, this, animal, this, pattern, is, closer, to, what, occurs, in, organisms, such, as, zebrafish, about, 78, while, in, humans, it, is, only, 70, tuatara, are, absolutely, protected, under, new, zealand, s, wildlife, act, 1953, the, species, is, also, listed, under, appendix, i, of, the, convention, on, international, trade, in, endangered, species, cites, meaning, commercial, international, trade, in, wild, sourced, specimens, is, prohibited, and, all, other, international, trade, including, in, parts, and, derivatives, is, regulated, by, the, cites, permit, system, tuatara, were, once, widespread, on, new, zealand, s, main, north, and, south, islands, where, subfossil, remains, have, been, found, in, sand, dunes, caves, and, m, ori, middens, wiped, out, from, the, main, islands, before, european, settlement, they, were, long, confined, to, 32, offshore, islands, free, of, mammals, the, islands, are, difficult, to, get, to, and, are, colonised, by, few, animal, species, indicating, that, some, animals, absent, from, these, islands, may, have, caused, tuatara, to, disappear, from, the, mainland, however, kiore, polynesian, rats, had, recently, become, established, on, several, of, the, islands, and, tuatara, were, persisting, but, not, breeding, on, these, islands, additionally, tuatara, were, much, rarer, on, the, rat, inhabited, islands, prior, to, conservation, work, 25, of, the, distinct, tuatara, populations, had, become, extinct, in, the, past, century, the, recent, discovery, of, a, tuatara, hatchling, on, the, mainland, indicates, that, attempts, to, re, establish, a, breeding, population, on, the, new, zealand, mainland, have, had, some, success, the, total, population, of, tuatara, is, estimated, to, be, between, 60, 000, and, 100, 000, tuatara, have, temperature, dependent, sex, determination, meaning, that, the, temperature, of, the, egg, determines, the, sex, of, the, animal, for, tuatara, lower, egg, incubation, temperatures, lead, to, females, while, higher, temperatures, lead, to, males, since, global, temperatures, are, increasing, climate, change, may, be, skewing, the, male, to, female, ratio, of, tuatara, current, solutions, to, this, potential, future, threat, are, the, selective, removal, of, adults, and, the, incubation, of, eggs, tuatara, were, removed, from, stanley, red, mercury, and, cuvier, islands, in, 1990, and, 1991, and, maintained, in, captivity, to, allow, polynesian, rats, to, be, eradicated, on, those, islands, all, three, populations, bred, in, captivity, and, after, successful, eradication, of, the, rats, all, individuals, including, the, new, juveniles, were, returned, to, their, islands, of, origin, in, the, 1991, 92, season, little, barrier, island, was, found, to, hold, only, eight, tuatara, which, were, taken, into, in, situ, captivity, where, females, produced, 42, eggs, which, were, incubated, at, victoria, university, the, resulting, offspring, were, subsequently, held, in, an, enclosure, on, the, island, then, released, into, the, wild, in, 2006, after, rats, were, eradicated, there, in, the, hen, and, chicken, islands, polynesian, rats, were, eradicated, on, whatupuke, in, 1993, lady, alice, island, in, 1994, and, coppermine, island, in, 1997, following, this, program, juveniles, have, once, again, been, seen, on, the, latter, three, islands, in, contrast, rats, persist, on, hen, island, of, the, same, group, and, no, juvenile, tuatara, have, been, seen, there, as, of, 2001, in, the, alderman, islands, middle, chain, island, holds, no, tuatara, but, it, is, considered, possible, for, rats, to, swim, between, middle, chain, and, other, islands, that, do, hold, tuatara, and, the, rats, were, eradicated, in, 1992, to, prevent, this, another, rodent, eradication, was, carried, out, on, the, rangitoto, islands, east, of, d, urville, island, to, prepare, for, the, release, of, 432, cook, strait, tuatara, juveniles, in, 2004, which, were, being, raised, at, victoria, university, as, of, 2001, sphenodon, punctatus, guntheri, is, present, naturally, on, one, small, island, with, a, population, of, approximately, 400, in, 1995, 50, juvenile, and, 18, adult, brothers, island, tuatara, were, moved, to, titi, island, in, cook, strait, and, their, establishment, monitored, two, years, later, more, than, half, of, the, animals, had, been, seen, again, and, of, those, all, but, one, had, gained, weight, in, 1998, 34, juveniles, from, captive, breeding, and, 20, wild, caught, adults, were, similarly, transferred, to, matiu, somes, island, a, more, publicly, accessible, location, in, wellington, harbour, the, captive, juveniles, were, from, induced, layings, from, wild, females, in, late, october, 2007, 50, tuatara, collected, as, eggs, from, north, brother, island, and, hatched, at, victoria, university, were, being, released, onto, long, island, in, the, outer, marlborough, sounds, the, animals, had, been, cared, for, at, wellington, zoo, for, the, previous, five, years, and, had, been, kept, in, secret, in, a, specially, built, enclosure, at, the, zoo, off, display, there, is, another, out, of, country, population, of, brothers, island, tuatara, that, was, given, to, the, san, diego, zoological, society, and, is, housed, off, display, at, the, san, diego, zoo, facility, in, balboa, no, successful, reproductive, efforts, have, been, reported, yet, s, punctatus, punctatus, naturally, occurs, on, 29, islands, and, its, population, is, estimated, to, be, over, 60, 000, individuals, in, 1996, 32, adult, northern, tuatara, were, moved, from, moutoki, island, to, moutohora, the, carrying, capacity, of, moutohora, is, estimated, at, 8, 500, individuals, and, the, island, could, allow, public, viewing, of, wild, tuatara, in, 2003, 60, northern, tuatara, were, introduced, to, tiritiri, matangi, island, from, middle, island, in, the, mercury, group, they, are, occasionally, seen, sunbathing, by, visitors, to, the, island, a, mainland, release, of, s, p, punctatus, occurred, in, 2005, in, the, heavily, fenced, and, monitored, karori, sanctuary, the, second, mainland, release, took, place, in, october, 2007, when, a, further, 130, were, transferred, from, stephens, island, to, the, karori, sanctuary, in, early, 2009, the, first, recorded, wild, born, offspring, were, observed, the, first, successful, breeding, of, tuatara, in, captivity, is, believed, to, have, achieved, by, sir, algernon, thomas, at, either, his, university, offices, or, residence, in, symonds, street, in, the, late, 1880s, or, his, new, home, trewithiel, in, mount, eden, in, the, early, 1890s, several, tuatara, breeding, programmes, are, active, in, new, zealand, southland, museum, and, art, gallery, in, invercargill, was, the, first, institution, to, have, a, tuatara, breeding, programme, starting, in, 1986, they, bred, s, punctatus, and, have, focused, on, s, guntheri, more, recently, hamilton, zoo, auckland, zoo, and, wellington, zoo, also, breed, tuatara, for, release, into, the, wild, at, auckland, zoo, in, the, 1990s, it, was, discovered, that, tuatara, have, temperature, dependent, sex, determination, the, victoria, university, of, wellington, maintains, a, research, programme, into, the, captive, breeding, of, tuatara, and, the, p, kaha, mount, bruce, national, wildlife, centre, keeps, a, pair, and, a, juvenile, the, wildnz, trust, has, a, tuatara, breeding, enclosure, at, ruawai, one, notable, captive, breeding, success, story, took, place, in, january, 2009, when, all, 11, eggs, belonging, to, 110, year, old, tuatara, henry, and, 80, year, old, tuatara, mildred, hatched, this, story, is, especially, remarkable, as, henry, required, surgery, to, remove, a, cancerous, tumour, in, order, to, successfully, breed, in, january, 2016, chester, zoo, england, announced, that, they, succeeded, in, breeding, the, tuatara, in, captivity, for, the, first, time, outside, its, homeland, tuatara, feature, in, a, number, of, indigenous, legends, and, are, held, as, ariki, god, forms, tuatara, are, regarded, as, the, messengers, of, whiro, the, god, of, death, and, disaster, and, m, ori, women, are, forbidden, to, eat, them, tuatara, also, indicate, tapu, the, borders, of, what, is, sacred, and, restricted, beyond, which, there, is, mana, meaning, there, could, be, serious, consequences, if, that, boundary, is, crossed, m, ori, women, would, sometimes, tattoo, images, of, lizards, some, of, which, may, represent, tuatara, near, their, genitals, today, tuatara, are, regarded, as, a, taonga, special, treasure, along, with, being, viewed, as, the, kaitiaki, guardian, of, knowledge, the, tuatara, was, featured, on, one, side, of, the, new, zealand, five, cent, coin, which, was, phased, out, in, october, 2006, tuatara, was, also, the, name, of, the, journal, of, the, biological, society, of, victoria, university, college, and, subsequently, victoria, university, of, wellington, published, from, 1947, until, 1993, it, has, now, been, digitised, by, the, new, zealand, electronic, text, centre, also, at, victoria
