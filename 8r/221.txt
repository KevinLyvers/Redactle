an, organism, s, sex, is, female, symbol, if, it, produces, the, ovum, egg, cell, the, type, of, gamete, sex, cell, that, fuses, with, the, male, gamete, sperm, cell, during, sexual, reproduction, a, female, has, larger, gametes, than, a, male, females, and, males, are, results, of, the, anisogamous, reproduction, system, wherein, gametes, are, of, different, sizes, unlike, isogamy, where, they, are, the, same, size, the, exact, mechanism, of, female, gamete, evolution, remains, unknown, in, species, that, have, males, and, females, sex, determination, may, be, based, on, either, sex, chromosomes, or, environmental, conditions, most, female, mammals, including, female, humans, have, two, x, chromosomes, characteristics, of, organisms, with, a, female, sex, vary, between, different, species, having, different, female, reproductive, systems, with, some, species, showing, characteristics, secondary, to, the, reproductive, system, as, with, mammary, glands, in, mammals, in, humans, the, word, female, can, also, be, used, to, refer, to, gender, in, the, social, sense, of, gender, role, or, gender, identity, the, word, female, comes, from, the, latin, femella, the, diminutive, form, of, femina, meaning, woman, by, way, of, the, old, french, femelle, it, is, not, etymologically, related, to, the, word, male, but, in, the, late, 14th, century, the, english, spelling, was, altered, to, parallel, that, of, male, it, has, been, used, as, both, noun, and, adjective, since, the, 14th, century, originally, from, its, first, appearance, in, the, 1300s, female, exclusively, referred, to, humans, and, always, indicated, that, the, speaker, spoke, of, a, woman, or, a, girl, a, century, later, the, meaning, was, stretched, to, include, non, human, female, organisms, for, several, centuries, using, the, word, female, as, a, noun, was, considered, more, respectful, than, calling, her, a, woman, or, a, lady, and, was, preferred, for, that, reason, however, by, 1895, the, linguistic, fashion, had, changed, and, female, was, often, considered, disparaging, usually, on, the, grounds, that, it, grouped, humans, with, other, animals, in, the, 21st, century, the, noun, female, is, primarily, used, to, describe, non, human, animals, to, refer, to, biologically, female, humans, in, an, impersonal, technical, context, e, g, females, were, more, likely, than, males, to, develop, an, autoimmune, disease, or, to, impartially, include, a, range, of, people, without, reference, to, age, e, g, girls, or, social, status, e, g, lady, as, an, adjective, female, is, still, used, in, some, contexts, particularly, when, the, sex, of, the, person, is, relevant, such, as, female, athletes, or, to, distinguish, a, male, nurse, from, a, female, one, biological, sex, is, conceptually, distinct, from, gender, although, they, are, often, used, interchangeably, the, adjective, female, can, describe, a, person, s, sex, or, gender, identity, the, word, can, also, refer, to, the, shape, of, connectors, and, fasteners, such, as, screws, electrical, pins, and, technical, equipment, under, this, convention, sockets, and, receptacles, are, called, female, and, the, corresponding, plugs, male, females, produce, ova, the, larger, gametes, in, a, heterogamous, reproduction, system, while, the, smaller, and, usually, motile, gametes, the, spermatozoa, are, produced, by, males, generally, a, female, cannot, reproduce, sexually, without, access, to, the, gametes, of, a, male, and, vice, versa, but, in, some, species, females, can, reproduce, by, themselves, asexually, for, example, via, parthenogenesis, patterns, of, sexual, reproduction, include, other, than, the, defining, difference, in, the, type, of, gamete, produced, differences, between, males, and, females, in, one, lineage, cannot, always, be, predicted, by, differences, in, another, the, concept, is, not, limited, to, animals, egg, cells, are, produced, by, chytrids, diatoms, water, moulds, and, land, plants, among, others, in, land, plants, female, and, male, designate, not, only, the, egg, and, sperm, producing, organisms, and, structures, but, also, the, structures, of, the, sporophytes, that, give, rise, to, male, and, female, plants, species, that, are, divided, into, females, and, males, are, classified, as, gonochoric, in, animals, as, dioecious, in, seed, plants, and, as, dioicous, in, cryptogams, 82, in, some, species, female, and, hermaphrodite, individuals, may, coexist, a, sexual, system, termed, gynodioecy, in, a, few, species, female, individuals, coexist, with, males, and, hermaphrodites, this, sexual, system, is, called, trioecy, in, thor, manningi, a, species, of, shrimp, females, coexist, with, males, and, protandrous, hermaphrodites, a, distinguishing, characteristic, of, the, class, mammalia, is, the, presence, of, mammary, glands, mammary, glands, are, modified, sweat, glands, that, produce, milk, which, is, used, to, feed, the, young, for, some, time, after, birth, only, mammals, produce, milk, mammary, glands, are, obvious, in, humans, because, the, female, human, body, stores, large, amounts, of, fatty, tissue, near, the, nipples, resulting, in, prominent, breasts, mammary, glands, are, present, in, all, mammals, although, they, are, normally, redundant, in, males, of, the, species, most, mammalian, females, have, two, copies, of, the, x, chromosome, while, males, have, only, one, x, and, one, smaller, y, chromosome, some, mammals, such, as, the, platypus, have, different, combinations, one, of, the, female, s, x, chromosomes, is, randomly, inactivated, in, each, cell, of, placental, mammals, while, the, paternally, derived, x, is, inactivated, in, marsupials, in, birds, and, some, reptiles, by, contrast, it, is, the, female, which, is, heterozygous, and, carries, a, z, and, a, w, chromosome, while, the, male, carries, two, z, chromosomes, in, mammals, females, can, have, xxx, or, x, mammalian, females, bear, live, young, with, the, exception, of, monotreme, females, which, lay, eggs, some, non, mammalian, species, such, as, guppies, have, analogous, reproductive, structures, and, some, other, non, mammals, such, as, some, sharks, also, bear, live, young, in, sex, determination, for, mammals, female, is, the, default, sex, while, in, the, poplar, genus, populus, the, default, is, male, the, sex, of, a, particular, organism, may, be, determined, by, genetic, or, environmental, factors, or, may, naturally, change, during, the, course, of, an, organism, s, life, the, sex, of, most, mammals, including, humans, is, genetically, determined, by, the, xy, sex, determination, system, where, females, have, xx, as, opposed, to, xy, in, males, sex, chromosomes, it, is, also, possible, in, a, variety, of, species, including, humans, to, have, other, karyotypes, during, reproduction, the, male, contributes, either, an, x, sperm, or, a, y, sperm, while, the, female, always, contributes, an, x, egg, a, y, sperm, and, an, x, egg, produce, a, male, while, an, x, sperm, and, an, x, egg, produce, a, female, the, zw, sex, determination, system, where, females, have, zw, as, opposed, to, zz, in, males, sex, chromosomes, is, found, in, birds, reptiles, and, some, insects, and, other, organisms, the, young, of, some, species, develop, into, one, sex, or, the, other, depending, on, local, environmental, conditions, e, g, the, sex, of, crocodilians, is, influenced, by, the, temperature, of, their, eggs, other, species, such, as, the, goby, can, transform, as, adults, from, one, sex, to, the, other, in, response, to, local, reproductive, conditions, such, as, a, brief, shortage, of, males, the, question, of, how, females, evolved, is, mainly, a, question, of, why, males, evolved, the, first, organisms, reproduced, asexually, usually, via, binary, fission, wherein, a, cell, splits, itself, in, half, from, a, strict, numbers, perspective, a, species, that, is, half, males, half, females, can, produce, half, the, offspring, an, asexual, population, can, because, only, the, females, are, having, offspring, being, male, can, also, carry, significant, costs, such, as, in, flashy, sexual, displays, in, animals, such, as, big, antlers, or, colorful, feathers, or, needing, to, produce, an, outsized, amount, of, pollen, as, a, plant, in, order, to, get, a, chance, to, fertilize, a, female, yet, despites, the, costs, of, being, male, there, must, be, some, advantage, to, the, process, the, advantages, are, explained, by, the, evolution, of, anisogamy, which, led, to, the, evolution, of, male, and, female, function, before, the, evolution, of, anisogamy, mating, types, in, a, species, were, isogamous, the, same, size, and, both, could, move, catalogued, only, as, or, types, 216, in, anisogamy, the, mating, cells, are, called, gametes, the, female, gamete, is, larger, than, the, male, gamete, and, usually, immotile, anisogamy, remains, poorly, understood, as, there, is, no, fossil, record, of, its, emergence, numerous, theories, exist, as, to, why, anisogamy, emerged, many, share, a, common, thread, in, that, larger, female, gametes, are, more, likely, to, survive, and, that, smaller, male, gametes, are, more, likely, to, find, other, gametes, because, they, can, travel, faster, current, models, often, fail, to, account, for, why, isogamy, remains, in, a, few, species, anisogamy, appears, to, have, evolved, multiple, times, from, isogamy, for, example, female, volvocales, a, type, of, green, algae, evolved, from, the, plus, mating, type, 222, although, sexual, evolution, emerged, at, least, 1, 2, billion, years, ago, the, lack, of, anisogamous, fossil, records, make, it, hard, to, pinpoint, when, females, evolved, female, sex, organs, genitalia, in, animals, have, an, extreme, range, of, variation, among, species, and, even, within, species, the, evolution, of, female, genitalia, remains, poorly, understood, compared, to, male, genitalia, reflecting, a, now, outdated, belief, that, female, genitalia, are, less, varied, than, male, genitalia, and, thus, less, useful, to, study, the, difficulty, of, reaching, female, genitalia, has, also, complicated, their, study, new, 3d, technology, has, made, female, genital, study, simpler, genitalia, evolve, very, quickly, there, are, three, main, hypotheses, as, to, what, impacts, female, genital, evolution, lock, and, key, genitals, must, fit, together, cryptic, female, choice, females, affect, whether, males, can, fertilize, them, and, sexual, conflict, a, sort, of, sexual, arms, race, there, is, also, a, hypothesis, that, female, genital, evolution, is, the, result, of, pleiotropy, i, e, unrelated, genes, that, are, affected, by, environmental, conditions, like, low, food, also, affect, genitals, this, hypothesis, is, unlikely, to, apply, to, a, significant, number, of, species, but, natural, selection, in, general, has, some, role, in, female, genital, evolution, the, symbol, unicode, u, 2640, alt, codes, alt, 12, a, circle, with, a, small, cross, underneath, is, commonly, used, to, represent, females, joseph, justus, scaliger, once, speculated, that, the, symbol, was, associated, with, venus, goddess, of, beauty, because, it, resembles, a, bronze, mirror, with, a, handle, but, modern, scholars, consider, that, fanciful, and, the, most, established, view, is, that, the, female, and, male, symbols, derive, from, contractions, in, greek, script, of, the, greek, names, of, the, planets, thouros, mars, and, phosphoros, venus
