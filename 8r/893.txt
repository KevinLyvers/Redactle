the, friesian, fries, paard, in, dutch, frysk, hynder, in, west, frisian, is, a, horse, breed, originating, in, friesland, in, north, netherlands, the, breed, nearly, became, extinct, on, more, than, one, occasion, it, is, classified, as, a, light, draught, horse, and, the, modern, day, friesian, horse, is, used, for, riding, and, driving, the, friesian, horse, is, most, known, for, its, all, black, coat, colour, its, long, flowing, mane, and, tail, feathering, on, its, legs, a, high, head, carriage, and, high, stepping, action, the, breed, has, powerful, overall, conformation, and, good, bone, structure, with, what, is, sometimes, called, a, baroque, body, type, friesians, have, long, arched, necks, well, chiseled, short, ears, and, spanish, type, heads, they, have, sloping, shoulders, compact, muscular, bodies, with, sloping, hindquarters, and, a, low, set, tail, limbs, are, short, and, strong, with, feathering, long, hair, on, the, lower, legs, a, friesian, horse, also, has, a, long, thick, mane, and, tail, often, wavy, the, breed, is, known, for, a, brisk, high, stepping, trot, the, friesian, is, considered, willing, active, and, energetic, but, also, gentle, and, docile, a, friesian, tends, to, have, great, presence, and, to, carry, itself, with, elegance, today, there, are, two, distinct, conformation, types, the, baroque, type, which, has, the, more, robust, build, of, the, classical, friesian, and, the, modern, sport, horse, type, which, is, finer, boned, both, types, are, common, though, the, modern, type, is, currently, more, popular, in, the, show, ring, than, is, the, baroque, friesian, however, conformation, type, is, considered, less, important, than, correct, movement, the, friesian, stands, on, average, about, 15, 3, hands, 63, inches, 160, cm, although, it, may, vary, from, 14, 2, to, 17, hands, 58, to, 68, inches, 147, to, 173, cm, at, the, withers, and, mares, or, geldings, must, be, at, least, 15, 2, hands, 62, inches, 157, cm, to, qualify, for, a, star, designation, pedigree, friesians, rarely, have, white, markings, of, any, kind, most, registries, allow, only, a, small, star, on, the, forehead, for, purebred, registration, though, friesian, horses, are, characteristically, black, occasionally, chestnut, colouring, appears, as, some, bloodlines, do, carry, the, red, e, gene, in, the, 1930s, chestnuts, and, bays, were, seen, the, chestnut, colour, is, generally, not, acceptable, for, stallions, though, it, is, sometimes, allowed, for, mares, and, geldings, a, chestnut, coloured, friesian, that, competes, is, penalised, discoloration, from, old, injuries, or, a, black, coat, fading, from, the, sun, is, not, penalised, in, 1990, the, friesch, paarden, stamboek, began, to, attempt, breeding, out, the, chestnut, colour, and, today, stallions, undergo, genetic, testing, if, testing, indicates, the, presence, of, the, chestnut, or, red, gene, even, if, heterozygous, and, masked, by, black, colour, the, horse, is, not, accepted, for, registration, with, the, fps, in, 2014, there, were, eight, stallion, lines, known, to, still, carry, the, chestnut, gene, the, american, friesian, association, which, is, not, affiliated, with, the, fps, allows, horses, with, white, markings, and, or, chestnut, colour, to, be, registered, if, purebred, parentage, can, be, proven, there, are, four, genetic, disorders, acknowledged, by, the, industry, that, may, affect, horses, of, friesian, breeding, dwarfism, hydrocephalus, a, tendency, for, aortic, rupture, and, megaesophagus, there, are, genetic, tests, for, the, first, two, conditions, the, friesian, is, also, among, several, breeds, that, may, develop, equine, polysaccharide, storage, myopathy, approximately, 0, 25, of, friesians, are, affected, by, dwarfism, which, results, in, horses, with, a, normal, sized, head, a, broader, chest, than, normal, an, abnormally, long, back, and, very, short, limbs, it, is, a, recessive, condition, additionally, the, breed, has, a, higher, than, usual, rate, of, digestive, system, disorders, and, a, greater, tendency, to, have, insect, bite, hypersensitivity, like, other, feathered, draught, breeds, they, are, prone, to, a, skin, condition, called, verrucous, pastern, dermatopathy, and, may, be, generally, prone, to, having, a, compromised, immune, system, friesian, mares, have, a, very, high, 54, rate, of, retained, placenta, after, foaling, some, normal, sized, friesians, also, have, a, propensity, toward, tendon, and, ligament, laxity, which, may, or, may, not, be, associated, with, dwarfism, the, relatively, small, gene, pool, and, inbreeding, are, thought, to, be, factors, behind, most, of, these, disorders, the, friesian, originates, in, the, province, of, friesland, in, the, northern, netherlands, where, there, is, evidence, of, thousands, of, years, of, horse, populations, as, far, back, in, history, as, the, 4th, century, there, are, mentions, of, friesian, troops, which, rode, their, own, horses, one, of, the, most, well, known, sources, of, this, was, by, an, english, writer, named, anthony, dent, who, wrote, about, the, friesian, mounted, troops, in, carlisle, dent, amongst, others, wrote, that, the, friesian, horse, was, the, ancestor, of, both, the, british, shire, horse, and, fell, pony, however, this, is, speculation, it, was, not, until, the, 11th, century, that, there, were, illustrations, of, what, appeared, to, be, friesians, many, of, the, illustrations, found, depict, knights, riding, horses, which, resemble, the, breed, with, one, of, the, most, famous, examples, being, william, the, conqueror, these, ancestors, of, the, modern, friesians, were, used, in, medieval, times, to, carry, knights, to, battle, in, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, some, eastern, horses, of, crusaders, were, mated, with, friesian, stock, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, when, the, netherlands, were, briefly, linked, with, spain, there, was, less, demand, for, heavy, war, horses, as, battle, arms, changed, and, became, lighter, andalusian, horses, were, bred, with, friesians, producing, a, lighter, horse, more, suitable, for, work, as, an, urban, carriage, horse, historian, ann, hyland, wrote, of, the, friesian, breed, the, emperor, charles, reigned, 1516, 56, continued, spanish, expansion, into, the, netherlands, which, had, its, frisian, warhorse, noted, by, vegetius, and, used, on, the, continent, and, in, britain, in, roman, times, like, the, andalusian, the, frisian, bred, true, to, type, even, with, infusions, of, spanish, blood, during, the, sixteenth, century, it, retained, its, indigenous, characteristics, taking, the, best, from, both, breeds, the, frisian, is, mentioned, in, 16th, and, 17th, century, works, as, a, courageous, horse, eminently, suitable, for, war, lacking, the, volatility, of, some, breeds, or, the, phlegm, of, very, heavy, ones, generally, black, the, frisian, was, around, 15hh, with, strong, cobby, conformation, but, with, a, deal, more, elegance, and, quality, the, noted, gait, was, a, smooth, trot, coming, from, powerful, quarters, nowadays, though, breed, definition, is, retained, the, size, has, markedly, increased, as, has, that, of, most, breeds, due, to, improved, rearing, and, dietary, methods, the, breed, was, especially, popular, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, when, they, were, in, demand, not, only, as, harness, horses, and, for, agricultural, work, but, also, for, the, trotting, races, so, popular, then, in, the, 1800s, the, friesian, was, bred, to, be, lighter, and, faster, for, trotting, but, this, led, to, what, some, owners, and, breeders, regarded, as, inferior, stock, so, a, movement, to, return, to, pureblood, stock, took, place, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, a, studbook, society, was, founded, in, 1879, by, frisian, farmers, and, landowners, who, had, gathered, to, found, the, fries, rundvee, stamboek, frs, 25, the, paardenstamboek, horse, stud, book, was, published, in, 1880, and, initially, registered, both, friesian, horses, and, a, group, of, heavy, warmblood, breeds, including, ostfriesen, and, alt, oldenburgers, collectively, known, as, bovenlanders, at, the, time, the, friesian, horse, was, declining, in, numbers, and, was, being, replaced, by, the, more, fashionable, bovenlanders, both, directly, and, by, crossbreeding, bovenlander, stallions, on, friesian, mares, this, had, already, virtually, exterminated, the, pure, friesian, in, significant, parts, of, the, province, in, 1879, which, made, the, inclusion, of, bovenlanders, necessary, while, the, work, of, the, society, led, to, a, revival, of, the, breed, in, the, late, 19th, century, it, also, resulted, in, the, sale, and, disappearance, of, many, of, the, best, stallions, from, the, breeding, area, and, friesian, horse, populations, dwindled, by, the, early, 20th, century, the, number, of, available, breeding, stallions, was, down, to, three, therefore, in, 1906, the, two, parts, of, the, registry, were, joined, and, the, studbook, was, renamed, the, friesch, paarden, stamboek, fps, in, 1907, in, 1913, a, society, het, friesch, paard, was, founded, to, protect, and, promote, the, breed, by, 1915, it, had, convinced, fps, to, split, registration, into, two, groups, by, 1943, the, breeders, of, non, friesian, horses, left, the, fps, completely, to, form, a, separate, association, which, later, became, the, koninklijk, warmbloed, paardenstamboek, nederland, royal, warmblood, studbook, of, the, netherlands, kwpn, displacement, by, mechanical, farm, equipment, on, dairy, farms, also, was, a, threat, to, the, survival, of, friesian, horse, the, last, draught, function, performed, by, friesians, on, a, significant, scale, was, on, farms, that, raised, dairy, cattle, world, war, ii, slowed, the, process, of, displacement, allowing, the, population, and, popularity, of, the, breed, to, rebound, important, in, the, initial, stage, of, the, recovery, of, the, breed, was, due, to, the, family, owned, circus, strassburger, who, having, fled, nazi, germany, for, the, low, countries, discovered, the, show, qualities, of, the, breed, and, demonstrated, its, abilities, outside, of, its, local, breeding, area, during, and, after, the, nazi, occupation, as, use, in, agricultural, pursuits, declined, the, friesian, became, popular, for, recreational, uses, today, about, seven, percent, of, the, horses, in, the, netherlands, are, friesians, the, friesian, horse, today, is, used, both, in, harness, and, under, saddle, particularly, in, the, discipline, of, dressage, in, harness, they, are, used, for, competitive, and, recreational, driving, a, traditional, carriage, seen, in, some, events, designed, for, friesian, horses, is, a, high, wheeled, cart, called, a, sjees, 82, friesians, are, also, used, to, pull, vintage, carriages, at, ceremonial, events, and, parades, because, of, their, color, and, striking, appearance, friesian, horses, are, a, popular, breed, in, movies, and, television, particularly, in, historic, and, fantasy, dramas, they, are, viewed, as, calm, in, the, face, of, the, activity, associated, with, filmmaking, but, also, elegant, on, camera, a, friesian, horse, is, defined, as, a, horse, that, meets, the, breed, description, as, described, in, the, breeding, goal, and, of, which, both, parents, are, registered, in, one, of, the, classes, of, the, main, section, of, the, kfps, kfps, koninklijke, vereniging, het, friesch, paarden, stamboek, kfps, which, means, royal, association, the, friesian, horse, studbook, is, the, original, friesian, studbook, founded, in, 1879, in, the, netherlands, and, is, the, world, recognized, official, studbook, for, the, friesian, horse, breed, kfps, has, licensed, about, 30, organizations, around, the, world, as, authorized, representatives, to, uphold, its, breeding, program, standards, record, registrations, and, arrange, horse, evaluations, most, kfps, registered, horses, are, in, the, netherlands, germany, and, north, america, kfps, studbook, breeding, is, strictly, controlled, and, breeding, a, kfps, registered, and, approved, stallion, to, any, non, kfps, mares, or, to, any, other, breed, of, horse, is, strongly, discouraged, other, registries, exist, for, friesians, and, friesian, crossbreeds, but, kfps, does, not, permit, dual, registration, for, a, stallion, to, be, approved, as, breeding, stock, it, must, pass, a, rigorous, approval, process, horses, are, judged, at, an, inspection, or, keuring, by, dutch, judges, who, decide, whether, the, horse, is, worthy, of, breeding, there, are, multiple, registries, within, kfps, the, two, main, registries, are, the, studbook, for, approved, stallions, and, the, foalbook, for, horses, from, the, mating, of, an, approved, stallion, and, a, mare, in, the, foalbook, there, are, two, auxiliary, registries, there, are, a, few, special, status, awards, that, can, be, obtained, during, evaluation, events, such, as, a, star, predicate, which, is, awarded, to, a, mare, gelding, or, unapproved, stallion, that, meets, minimum, standards, of, conformation, movement, and, minimum, height, and, a, sport, predicate, is, awarded, to, horses, that, have, achieved, certain, performance, goals, in, dressage, or, driving, competitions, kfps, registered, horses, born, prior, to, 1997, had, tongue, tattoos, horses, born, after, have, a, microchip, implant, in, the, upper, left, neck, the, tattoo, or, chip, numbers, are, recorded, on, the, registration, papers, names, given, to, foals, born, in, a, certain, year, must, begin, with, a, fixed, letter, as, determined, by, kfps, parentage, is, verified, with, dna, testing, and, mares, are, dna, tested, for, hydrocephalus, and, dwarfism, unless, their, sire, and, dam, had, both, tested, as, non, carriers
