vitamins, are, organic, molecules, or, a, set, of, closely, related, molecules, called, vitamers, that, are, essential, to, an, organism, in, small, quantities, for, proper, metabolic, function, essential, nutrients, cannot, be, synthesized, in, the, organism, in, sufficient, quantities, for, survival, and, therefore, must, be, obtained, through, the, diet, for, example, vitamin, c, can, be, synthesized, by, some, species, but, not, by, others, it, is, not, considered, a, vitamin, in, the, first, instance, but, is, in, the, second, most, vitamins, are, not, single, molecules, but, groups, of, related, molecules, called, vitamers, for, example, there, are, eight, vitamers, of, vitamin, e, four, tocopherols, and, four, tocotrienols, the, term, vitamin, does, not, include, the, three, other, groups, of, essential, nutrients, minerals, essential, fatty, acids, and, essential, amino, acids, major, health, organizations, list, thirteen, vitamins, some, sources, include, a, fourteenth, choline, vitamins, have, diverse, biochemical, functions, vitamin, a, acts, as, a, regulator, of, cell, and, tissue, growth, and, differentiation, vitamin, d, provides, a, hormone, like, function, regulating, mineral, metabolism, for, bones, and, other, organs, the, b, complex, vitamins, function, as, enzyme, cofactors, coenzymes, or, the, precursors, for, them, vitamins, c, and, e, function, as, antioxidants, both, deficient, and, excess, intake, of, a, vitamin, can, potentially, cause, clinically, significant, illness, although, excess, intake, of, water, soluble, vitamins, is, less, likely, to, do, so, all, the, vitamins, were, discovered, between, 1913, and, 1948, historically, when, intake, of, vitamins, from, diet, was, lacking, the, results, were, vitamin, deficiency, diseases, then, starting, in, 1935, commercially, produced, tablets, of, yeast, extract, vitamin, b, complex, and, semi, synthetic, vitamin, c, became, available, this, was, followed, in, the, 1950s, by, the, mass, production, and, marketing, of, vitamin, supplements, including, multivitamins, to, prevent, vitamin, deficiencies, in, the, general, population, governments, have, mandated, the, addition, of, some, vitamins, to, staple, foods, such, as, flour, or, milk, referred, to, as, food, fortification, to, prevent, deficiencies, recommendations, for, folic, acid, supplementation, during, pregnancy, reduced, risk, of, infant, neural, tube, defects, from, plant, origin, as, provitamin, a, all, trans, beta, carotene, orange, ripe, yellow, fruits, leafy, vegetables, carrots, pumpkin, squash, spinach, the, value, of, eating, certain, foods, to, maintain, health, was, recognized, long, before, vitamins, were, identified, the, ancient, egyptians, knew, that, feeding, liver, to, a, person, may, help, with, night, blindness, an, illness, now, known, to, be, caused, by, a, vitamin, a, deficiency, the, advance, of, ocean, voyages, during, the, age, of, discovery, resulted, in, prolonged, periods, without, access, to, fresh, fruits, and, vegetables, and, made, illnesses, from, vitamin, deficiency, common, among, ships, crews, in, 1747, the, scottish, surgeon, james, lind, discovered, that, citrus, foods, helped, prevent, scurvy, a, particularly, deadly, disease, in, which, collagen, is, not, properly, formed, causing, poor, wound, healing, bleeding, of, the, gums, severe, pain, and, death, in, 1753, lind, published, his, treatise, on, the, scurvy, which, recommended, using, lemons, and, limes, to, avoid, scurvy, which, was, adopted, by, the, british, royal, navy, this, led, to, the, nickname, limey, for, british, sailors, however, during, the, 19th, century, limes, grown, in, the, west, indies, were, substituted, for, lemons, these, were, subsequently, found, to, be, much, lower, in, vitamin, c, as, a, result, arctic, expeditions, continued, to, be, plagued, by, scurvy, and, other, deficiency, diseases, in, the, early, 20th, century, when, robert, falcon, scott, made, his, two, expeditions, to, the, antarctic, the, prevailing, medical, theory, was, that, scurvy, was, caused, by, tainted, canned, food, in, 1881, russian, medical, doctor, nikolai, lunin, studied, the, effects, of, scurvy, at, the, university, of, tartu, he, fed, mice, an, artificial, mixture, of, all, the, separate, constituents, of, milk, known, at, that, time, namely, the, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and, salts, the, mice, that, received, only, the, individual, constituents, died, while, the, mice, fed, by, milk, itself, developed, normally, he, made, a, conclusion, that, a, natural, food, such, as, milk, must, therefore, contain, besides, these, known, principal, ingredients, small, quantities, of, unknown, substances, essential, to, life, however, his, conclusions, were, rejected, by, his, advisor, gustav, von, bunge, a, similar, result, by, cornelis, adrianus, pekelharing, appeared, in, dutch, medical, journal, nederlands, tijdschrift, voor, geneeskunde, in, 1905, but, it, was, not, widely, reported, in, east, asia, where, polished, white, rice, was, the, common, staple, food, of, the, middle, class, beriberi, resulting, from, lack, of, vitamin, b, 1, was, endemic, in, 1884, takaki, kanehiro, a, british, trained, medical, doctor, of, the, imperial, japanese, navy, observed, that, beriberi, was, endemic, among, low, ranking, crew, who, often, ate, nothing, but, rice, but, not, among, officers, who, consumed, a, western, style, diet, with, the, support, of, the, japanese, navy, he, experimented, using, crews, of, two, battleships, one, crew, was, fed, only, white, rice, while, the, other, was, fed, a, diet, of, meat, fish, barley, rice, and, beans, the, group, that, ate, only, white, rice, documented, 161, crew, members, with, beriberi, and, 25, deaths, while, the, latter, group, had, only, 14, cases, of, beriberi, and, no, deaths, this, convinced, takaki, and, the, japanese, navy, that, diet, was, the, cause, of, beriberi, but, they, mistakenly, believed, that, sufficient, amounts, of, protein, prevented, it, that, diseases, could, result, from, some, dietary, deficiencies, was, further, investigated, by, christiaan, eijkman, who, in, 1897, discovered, that, feeding, unpolished, rice, instead, of, the, polished, variety, to, chickens, helped, to, prevent, a, kind, of, polyneuritis, that, was, the, equivalent, of, beriberi, the, following, year, frederick, hopkins, postulated, that, some, foods, contained, accessory, factors, in, addition, to, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, etc, that, are, necessary, for, the, functions, of, the, human, body, in, 1910, the, first, vitamin, complex, was, isolated, by, japanese, scientist, umetaro, suzuki, who, succeeded, in, extracting, a, water, soluble, complex, of, micronutrients, from, rice, bran, and, named, it, aberic, acid, later, orizanin, he, published, this, discovery, in, a, japanese, scientific, journal, when, the, article, was, translated, into, german, the, translation, failed, to, state, that, it, was, a, newly, discovered, nutrient, a, claim, made, in, the, original, japanese, article, and, hence, his, discovery, failed, to, gain, publicity, in, 1912, polish, born, biochemist, casimir, funk, working, in, london, isolated, the, same, complex, of, micronutrients, and, proposed, the, complex, be, named, vitamine, it, was, later, to, be, known, as, vitamin, b, 3, niacin, though, he, described, it, as, anti, beri, beri, factor, which, would, today, be, called, thiamine, or, vitamin, b, 1, funk, proposed, the, hypothesis, that, other, diseases, such, as, rickets, pellagra, coeliac, disease, and, scurvy, could, also, be, cured, by, vitamins, max, nierenstein, a, friend, and, reader, of, biochemistry, at, bristol, university, reportedly, suggested, the, vitamine, name, from, vital, amine, the, name, soon, became, synonymous, with, hopkins, accessory, factors, and, by, the, time, it, was, shown, that, not, all, vitamins, are, amines, the, word, was, already, ubiquitous, in, 1920, jack, cecil, drummond, proposed, that, the, final, e, be, dropped, to, deemphasize, the, amine, reference, hence, vitamin, after, researchers, began, to, suspect, that, not, all, vitamines, in, particular, vitamin, a, have, an, amine, component, the, nobel, prize, for, chemistry, for, 1928, was, awarded, to, adolf, windaus, for, his, studies, on, the, constitution, of, the, sterols, and, their, connection, with, vitamins, the, first, person, to, receive, an, award, mentioning, vitamins, even, though, it, was, not, specifically, about, vitamin, d, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, 1929, was, awarded, to, christiaan, eijkman, and, frederick, gowland, hopkins, for, their, contributions, to, the, discovery, of, vitamins, thirty, five, years, earlier, eijkman, had, observed, that, chickens, fed, polished, white, rice, developed, neurological, symptoms, similar, to, those, observed, in, military, sailors, and, soldiers, fed, a, rice, based, diet, and, that, the, symptoms, were, reversed, when, the, chickens, were, switched, to, whole, grain, rice, he, called, this, the, anti, beriberi, factor, which, was, later, identified, as, vitamin, b, 1, thiamine, in, 1930, paul, karrer, elucidated, the, correct, structure, for, beta, carotene, the, main, precursor, of, vitamin, a, and, identified, other, carotenoids, karrer, and, norman, haworth, confirmed, albert, szent, gy, rgyi, s, discovery, of, ascorbic, acid, and, made, significant, contributions, to, the, chemistry, of, flavins, which, led, to, the, identification, of, lactoflavin, for, their, investigations, on, carotenoids, flavins, and, vitamins, a, and, b, 2, they, both, received, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1937, in, 1931, albert, szent, gy, rgyi, and, a, fellow, researcher, joseph, svirbely, suspected, that, hexuronic, acid, was, actually, vitamin, c, and, gave, a, sample, to, charles, glen, king, who, proved, its, activity, counter, to, scurvy, in, his, long, established, guinea, pig, scorbutic, assay, in, 1937, szent, gy, rgyi, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, his, discovery, in, 1943, edward, adelbert, doisy, and, henrik, dam, were, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, their, discovery, of, vitamin, k, and, its, chemical, structure, in, 1938, richard, kuhn, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, work, on, carotenoids, and, vitamins, specifically, b, 2, and, b, 6, five, people, have, been, awarded, nobel, prizes, for, direct, and, indirect, studies, of, vitamin, b, 12, george, whipple, george, minot, and, william, p, murphy, 1934, alexander, r, todd, 1957, and, dorothy, hodgkin, 1964, in, 1967, george, wald, ragnar, granit, and, haldan, keffer, hartline, were, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, and, medicine, for, their, discoveries, concerning, the, primary, physiological, and, chemical, visual, processes, in, the, eye, wald, s, contribution, was, discovering, the, role, vitamin, a, had, in, the, process, once, discovered, vitamins, were, actively, promoted, in, articles, and, advertisements, in, mccall, s, good, housekeeping, and, other, media, outlets, marketers, enthusiastically, promoted, cod, liver, oil, a, source, of, vitamin, d, as, bottled, sunshine, and, bananas, as, a, natural, vitality, food, they, promoted, foods, such, as, yeast, cakes, a, source, of, b, vitamins, on, the, basis, of, scientifically, determined, nutritional, value, rather, than, taste, or, appearance, in, 1942, when, flour, enrichment, with, nicotinic, acid, began, a, headline, in, the, popular, press, said, tobacco, in, your, bread, in, response, the, council, on, foods, and, nutrition, of, the, american, medical, association, approved, of, the, food, and, nutrition, board, s, new, names, niacin, and, niacin, amide, for, use, primarily, by, non, scientists, it, was, thought, appropriate, to, choose, a, name, to, dissociate, nicotinic, acid, from, nicotine, to, avoid, the, perception, that, vitamins, or, niacin, rich, food, contains, nicotine, or, that, cigarettes, contain, vitamins, the, resulting, name, niacin, was, derived, from, ni, cotinic, ac, id, vitam, in, researchers, also, focused, on, the, need, to, ensure, adequate, nutrition, especially, to, compensate, for, what, was, lost, in, the, manufacture, of, processed, foods, robert, w, yoder, is, credited, with, first, using, the, term, vitamania, in, 1942, to, describe, the, appeal, of, relying, on, nutritional, supplements, rather, than, on, obtaining, vitamins, from, a, varied, diet, of, foods, the, continuing, preoccupation, with, a, healthy, lifestyle, led, to, an, obsessive, consumption, of, vitamins, and, multi, vitamins, the, beneficial, effects, of, which, are, questionable, as, one, example, in, the, 1950s, the, wonder, bread, company, sponsored, the, howdy, doody, television, show, with, host, buffalo, bob, smith, telling, the, audience, wonder, bread, builds, strong, bodies, 8, ways, referring, to, the, number, of, added, nutrients, the, term, vitamin, was, derived, from, vitamine, a, portmanteau, coined, in, 1912, by, the, biochemist, casimir, funk, while, working, at, the, lister, institute, of, preventive, medicine, funk, created, the, name, from, vital, and, amine, because, it, appeared, that, these, organic, micronutrient, food, factors, that, prevent, beriberi, and, perhaps, other, similar, dietary, deficiency, diseases, were, required, for, life, hence, vital, and, were, chemical, amines, hence, amine, this, was, true, of, thiamine, but, after, it, was, found, that, vitamin, c, and, other, such, micronutrients, were, not, amines, the, word, was, shortened, to, vitamin, in, english, vitamins, are, classified, as, either, water, soluble, or, fat, soluble, in, humans, there, are, 13, vitamins, 4, fat, soluble, a, d, e, and, k, and, 9, water, soluble, 8, b, vitamins, and, vitamin, c, water, soluble, vitamins, dissolve, easily, in, water, and, in, general, are, readily, excreted, from, the, body, to, the, degree, that, urinary, output, is, a, strong, predictor, of, vitamin, consumption, because, they, are, not, as, readily, stored, more, consistent, intake, is, important, fat, soluble, vitamins, are, absorbed, through, the, gastrointestinal, tract, with, the, help, of, lipids, fats, vitamins, a, and, d, can, accumulate, in, the, body, which, can, result, in, dangerous, hypervitaminosis, fat, soluble, vitamin, deficiency, due, to, malabsorption, is, of, particular, significance, in, cystic, fibrosis, anti, vitamins, are, chemical, compounds, that, inhibit, the, absorption, or, actions, of, vitamins, for, example, avidin, is, a, protein, in, raw, egg, whites, that, inhibits, the, absorption, of, biotin, it, is, deactivated, by, cooking, pyrithiamine, a, synthetic, compound, has, a, molecular, structure, similar, to, thiamine, vitamin, b, 1, and, inhibits, the, enzymes, that, use, thiamine, each, vitamin, is, typically, used, in, multiple, reactions, and, therefore, most, have, multiple, functions, vitamins, are, essential, for, the, normal, growth, and, development, of, a, multicellular, organism, using, the, genetic, blueprint, inherited, from, its, parents, a, fetus, develops, from, the, nutrients, it, absorbs, it, requires, certain, vitamins, and, minerals, to, be, present, at, certain, times, these, nutrients, facilitate, the, chemical, reactions, that, produce, among, other, things, skin, bone, and, muscle, if, there, is, serious, deficiency, in, one, or, more, of, these, nutrients, a, child, may, develop, a, deficiency, disease, even, minor, deficiencies, may, cause, permanent, damage, once, growth, and, development, are, completed, vitamins, remain, essential, nutrients, for, the, healthy, maintenance, of, the, cells, tissues, and, organs, that, make, up, a, multicellular, organism, they, also, enable, a, multicellular, life, form, to, efficiently, use, chemical, energy, provided, by, food, it, eats, and, to, help, process, the, proteins, carbohydrates, and, fats, required, for, cellular, respiration, for, the, most, part, vitamins, are, obtained, from, the, diet, but, some, are, acquired, by, other, means, for, example, microorganisms, in, the, gut, flora, produce, vitamin, k, and, biotin, and, one, form, of, vitamin, d, is, synthesized, in, skin, cells, when, they, are, exposed, to, a, certain, wavelength, of, ultraviolet, light, present, in, sunlight, humans, can, produce, some, vitamins, from, precursors, they, consume, for, example, vitamin, a, is, synthesized, from, beta, carotene, and, niacin, is, synthesized, from, the, amino, acid, tryptophan, vitamin, c, can, be, synthesized, by, some, species, but, not, by, others, vitamin, b, 12, is, the, only, vitamin, or, nutrient, not, available, from, plant, sources, the, food, fortification, initiative, lists, countries, which, have, mandatory, fortification, programs, for, vitamins, folic, acid, niacin, vitamin, a, and, vitamins, b, 1, b, 2, and, b, 12, the, body, s, stores, for, different, vitamins, vary, widely, vitamins, a, d, and, b, 12, are, stored, in, significant, amounts, mainly, in, the, liver, and, an, adult, s, diet, may, be, deficient, in, vitamins, a, and, d, for, many, months, and, b, 12, in, some, cases, for, years, before, developing, a, deficiency, condition, however, vitamin, b, 3, niacin, and, niacinamide, is, not, stored, in, significant, amounts, so, stores, may, last, only, a, couple, of, weeks, for, vitamin, c, the, first, symptoms, of, scurvy, in, experimental, studies, of, complete, vitamin, c, deprivation, in, humans, have, varied, widely, from, a, month, to, more, than, six, months, depending, on, previous, dietary, history, that, determined, body, stores, deficiencies, of, vitamins, are, classified, as, either, primary, or, secondary, a, primary, deficiency, occurs, when, an, organism, does, not, get, enough, of, the, vitamin, in, its, food, a, secondary, deficiency, may, be, due, to, an, underlying, disorder, that, prevents, or, limits, the, absorption, or, use, of, the, vitamin, due, to, a, lifestyle, factor, such, as, smoking, excessive, alcohol, consumption, or, the, use, of, medications, that, interfere, with, the, absorption, or, use, of, the, vitamin, people, who, eat, a, varied, diet, are, unlikely, to, develop, a, severe, primary, vitamin, deficiency, but, may, be, consuming, less, than, the, recommended, amounts, a, national, food, and, supplement, survey, conducted, in, the, us, over, 2003, 2006, reported, that, over, 90, of, individuals, who, did, not, consume, vitamin, supplements, were, found, to, have, inadequate, levels, of, some, of, the, essential, vitamins, notably, vitamins, d, and, e, well, researched, human, vitamin, deficiencies, involve, thiamine, beriberi, niacin, pellagra, vitamin, c, scurvy, folate, neural, tube, defects, and, vitamin, d, rickets, in, much, of, the, developed, world, these, deficiencies, are, rare, due, to, an, adequate, supply, of, food, and, the, addition, of, vitamins, to, common, foods, in, addition, to, these, classical, vitamin, deficiency, diseases, some, evidence, has, also, suggested, links, between, vitamin, deficiency, and, a, number, of, different, disorders, some, vitamins, have, documented, acute, or, chronic, toxicity, at, larger, intakes, which, is, referred, to, as, hypertoxicity, the, european, union, and, the, governments, of, several, countries, have, established, tolerable, upper, intake, levels, uls, for, those, vitamins, which, have, documented, toxicity, see, table, the, likelihood, of, consuming, too, much, of, any, vitamin, from, food, is, remote, but, excessive, intake, vitamin, poisoning, from, dietary, supplements, does, occur, in, 2016, overdose, exposure, to, all, formulations, of, vitamins, and, multi, vitamin, mineral, formulations, was, reported, by, 63, 931, individuals, to, the, american, association, of, poison, control, centers, with, 72, of, these, exposures, in, children, under, the, age, of, five, in, the, us, analysis, of, a, national, diet, and, supplement, survey, reported, that, about, 7, of, adult, supplement, users, exceeded, the, ul, for, folate, and, 5, of, those, older, than, age, 50, years, exceeded, the, ul, for, vitamin, a, the, usda, has, conducted, extensive, studies, on, the, percentage, losses, of, various, nutrients, from, food, types, and, cooking, methods, some, vitamins, may, become, more, bio, available, that, is, usable, by, the, body, when, foods, are, cooked, the, table, below, shows, whether, various, vitamins, are, susceptible, to, loss, from, heat, such, as, heat, from, boiling, steaming, frying, etc, the, effect, of, cutting, vegetables, can, be, seen, from, exposure, to, air, and, light, water, soluble, vitamins, such, as, b, and, c, dissolve, into, the, water, when, a, vegetable, is, boiled, and, are, then, lost, when, the, water, is, discarded, in, setting, human, nutrient, guidelines, government, organizations, do, not, necessarily, agree, on, amounts, needed, to, avoid, deficiency, or, maximum, amounts, to, avoid, the, risk,
