phytomorphology, is, the, study, of, the, physical, form, and, external, structure, of, plants, this, is, usually, considered, distinct, from, plant, anatomy, which, is, the, study, of, the, internal, structure, of, plants, especially, at, the, microscopic, level, plant, morphology, is, useful, in, the, visual, identification, of, plants, recent, studies, in, molecular, biology, started, to, investigate, the, molecular, processes, involved, in, determining, the, conservation, and, diversification, of, plant, morphologies, in, these, studies, transcriptome, conservation, patterns, were, found, to, mark, crucial, ontogenetic, transitions, during, the, plant, life, cycle, which, may, result, in, evolutionary, constraints, limiting, diversification, plant, morphology, represents, a, study, of, the, development, form, and, structure, of, plants, and, by, implication, an, attempt, to, interpret, these, on, the, basis, of, similarity, of, plan, and, origin, there, are, four, major, areas, of, investigation, in, plant, morphology, and, each, overlaps, with, another, field, of, the, biological, sciences, first, of, all, morphology, is, comparative, meaning, that, the, morphologist, examines, structures, in, many, different, plants, of, the, same, or, different, species, then, draws, comparisons, and, formulates, ideas, about, similarities, when, structures, in, different, species, are, believed, to, exist, and, develop, as, a, result, of, common, inherited, genetic, pathways, those, structures, are, termed, homologous, for, example, the, leaves, of, pine, oak, and, cabbage, all, look, very, different, but, share, certain, basic, structures, and, arrangement, of, parts, the, homology, of, leaves, is, an, easy, conclusion, to, make, the, plant, morphologist, goes, further, and, discovers, that, the, spines, of, cactus, also, share, the, same, basic, structure, and, development, as, leaves, in, other, plants, and, therefore, cactus, spines, are, homologous, to, leaves, as, well, this, aspect, of, plant, morphology, overlaps, with, the, study, of, plant, evolution, and, paleobotany, secondly, plant, morphology, observes, both, the, vegetative, somatic, structures, of, plants, as, well, as, the, reproductive, structures, the, vegetative, structures, of, vascular, plants, includes, the, study, of, the, shoot, system, composed, of, stems, and, leaves, as, well, as, the, root, system, the, reproductive, structures, are, more, varied, and, are, usually, specific, to, a, particular, group, of, plants, such, as, flowers, and, seeds, fern, sori, and, moss, capsules, the, detailed, study, of, reproductive, structures, in, plants, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, alternation, of, generations, found, in, all, plants, and, most, algae, this, area, of, plant, morphology, overlaps, with, the, study, of, biodiversity, and, plant, systematics, thirdly, plant, morphology, studies, plant, structure, at, a, range, of, scales, at, the, smallest, scales, are, ultrastructure, the, general, structural, features, of, cells, visible, only, with, the, aid, of, an, electron, microscope, and, cytology, the, study, of, cells, using, optical, microscopy, at, this, scale, plant, morphology, overlaps, with, plant, anatomy, as, a, field, of, study, at, the, largest, scale, is, the, study, of, plant, growth, habit, the, overall, architecture, of, a, plant, the, pattern, of, branching, in, a, tree, will, vary, from, species, to, species, as, will, the, appearance, of, a, plant, as, a, tree, herb, or, grass, fourthly, plant, morphology, examines, the, pattern, of, development, the, process, by, which, structures, originate, and, mature, as, a, plant, grows, while, animals, produce, all, the, body, parts, they, will, ever, have, from, early, in, their, life, plants, constantly, produce, new, tissues, and, structures, throughout, their, life, a, living, plant, always, has, embryonic, tissues, the, way, in, which, new, structures, mature, as, they, are, produced, may, be, affected, by, the, point, in, the, plant, s, life, when, they, begin, to, develop, as, well, as, by, the, environment, to, which, the, structures, are, exposed, a, morphologist, studies, this, process, the, causes, and, its, result, this, area, of, plant, morphology, overlaps, with, plant, physiology, and, ecology, a, plant, morphologist, makes, comparisons, between, structures, in, many, different, plants, of, the, same, or, different, species, making, such, comparisons, between, similar, structures, in, different, plants, tackles, the, question, of, why, the, structures, are, similar, it, is, quite, likely, that, similar, underlying, causes, of, genetics, physiology, or, response, to, the, environment, have, led, to, this, similarity, in, appearance, the, result, of, scientific, investigation, into, these, causes, can, lead, to, one, of, two, insights, into, the, underlying, biology, understanding, which, characteristics, and, structures, belong, to, each, type, is, an, important, part, of, understanding, plant, evolution, the, evolutionary, biologist, relies, on, the, plant, morphologist, to, interpret, structures, and, in, turn, provides, phylogenies, of, plant, relationships, that, may, lead, to, new, morphological, insights, when, structures, in, different, species, are, believed, to, exist, and, develop, as, a, result, of, common, inherited, genetic, pathways, those, structures, are, termed, homologous, for, example, the, leaves, of, pine, oak, and, cabbage, all, look, very, different, but, share, certain, basic, structures, and, arrangement, of, parts, the, homology, of, leaves, is, an, easy, conclusion, to, make, the, plant, morphologist, goes, further, and, discovers, that, the, spines, of, cactus, also, share, the, same, basic, structure, and, development, as, leaves, in, other, plants, and, therefore, cactus, spines, are, homologous, to, leaves, as, well, when, structures, in, different, species, are, believed, to, exist, and, develop, as, a, result, of, common, adaptive, responses, to, environmental, pressure, those, structures, are, termed, convergent, for, example, the, fronds, of, bryopsis, plumosa, and, stems, of, asparagus, setaceus, both, have, the, same, feathery, branching, appearance, even, though, one, is, an, alga, and, one, is, a, flowering, plant, the, similarity, in, overall, structure, occurs, independently, as, a, result, of, convergence, the, growth, form, of, many, cacti, and, species, of, euphorbia, is, very, similar, even, though, they, belong, to, widely, distant, families, the, similarity, results, from, common, solutions, to, the, problem, of, surviving, in, a, hot, dry, environment, plant, morphology, treats, both, the, vegetative, structures, of, plants, as, well, as, the, reproductive, structures, the, vegetative, somatic, structures, of, vascular, plants, include, two, major, organ, systems, 1, a, shoot, system, composed, of, stems, and, leaves, and, 2, a, root, system, these, two, systems, are, common, to, nearly, all, vascular, plants, and, provide, a, unifying, theme, for, the, study, of, plant, morphology, by, contrast, the, reproductive, structures, are, varied, and, are, usually, specific, to, a, particular, group, of, plants, structures, such, as, flowers, and, fruits, are, only, found, in, the, angiosperms, sori, are, only, found, in, ferns, and, seed, cones, are, only, found, in, conifers, and, other, gymnosperms, reproductive, characters, are, therefore, regarded, as, more, useful, for, the, classification, of, plants, than, vegetative, characters, plant, biologists, use, morphological, characters, of, plants, which, can, be, compared, measured, counted, and, described, to, assess, the, differences, or, similarities, in, plant, taxa, and, use, these, characters, for, plant, identification, classification, and, descriptions, when, characters, are, used, in, descriptions, or, for, identification, they, are, called, diagnostic, or, key, characters, which, can, be, either, qualitative, and, quantitative, both, kinds, of, characters, can, be, very, useful, for, the, identification, of, plants, the, detailed, study, of, reproductive, structures, in, plants, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, alternation, of, generations, found, in, all, plants, and, most, algae, by, the, german, botanist, wilhelm, hofmeister, this, discovery, is, one, of, the, most, important, made, in, all, of, plant, morphology, since, it, provides, a, common, basis, for, understanding, the, life, cycle, of, all, plants, the, primary, function, of, pigments, in, plants, is, photosynthesis, which, uses, the, green, pigment, chlorophyll, along, with, several, red, and, yellow, pigments, that, help, to, capture, as, much, light, energy, as, possible, the, other, pigments, ic, carotenoids, pigments, are, also, an, important, factor, in, attracting, insects, to, flowers, to, encourage, pollination, plant, pigments, include, a, variety, of, different, kinds, of, molecule, including, porphyrins, carotenoids, anthocyanins, and, betalains, all, biological, pigments, selectively, absorb, certain, wavelengths, of, light, while, reflecting, others, the, light, that, is, absorbed, may, be, used, by, the, plant, to, power, chemical, reactions, while, the, reflected, wavelengths, of, light, determine, the, color, the, pigment, will, appear, to, the, eye, plant, development, is, the, process, by, which, structures, originate, and, mature, as, a, plant, grows, it, is, a, subject, studies, in, plant, anatomy, and, plant, physiology, as, well, as, plant, morphology, the, process, of, development, in, plants, is, fundamentally, different, from, that, seen, in, vertebrate, animals, when, an, animal, embryo, begins, to, develop, it, will, very, early, produce, all, of, the, body, parts, that, it, will, ever, have, in, its, life, when, the, animal, is, born, or, hatches, from, its, egg, it, has, all, its, body, parts, and, from, that, point, will, only, grow, larger, and, more, mature, by, contrast, plants, constantly, produce, new, tissues, and, structures, throughout, their, life, from, meristems, located, at, the, tips, of, organs, or, between, mature, tissues, thus, a, living, plant, always, has, embryonic, tissues, the, properties, of, organisation, seen, in, a, plant, are, emergent, properties, which, are, more, than, the, sum, of, the, individual, parts, the, assembly, of, these, tissues, and, functions, into, an, integrated, multicellular, organism, yields, not, only, the, characteristics, of, the, separate, parts, and, processes, but, also, quite, a, new, set, of, characteristics, which, would, not, have, been, predictable, on, the, basis, of, examination, of, the, separate, parts, in, other, words, knowing, everything, about, the, molecules, in, a, plant, are, not, enough, to, predict, characteristics, of, the, cells, and, knowing, all, the, properties, of, the, cells, will, not, predict, all, the, properties, of, a, plant, s, structure, a, vascular, plant, begins, from, a, single, celled, zygote, formed, by, fertilisation, of, an, egg, cell, by, a, sperm, cell, from, that, point, it, begins, to, divide, to, form, a, plant, embryo, through, the, process, of, embryogenesis, as, this, happens, the, resulting, cells, will, organise, so, that, one, end, becomes, the, first, root, while, the, other, end, forms, the, tip, of, the, shoot, in, seed, plants, the, embryo, will, develop, one, or, more, seed, leaves, cotyledons, by, the, end, of, embryogenesis, the, young, plant, will, have, all, the, parts, necessary, to, begin, in, its, life, once, the, embryo, germinates, from, its, seed, or, parent, plant, it, begins, to, produce, additional, organs, leaves, stems, and, roots, through, the, process, of, organogenesis, new, roots, grow, from, root, meristems, located, at, the, tip, of, the, root, and, new, stems, and, leaves, grow, from, shoot, meristems, located, at, the, tip, of, the, shoot, branching, occurs, when, small, clumps, of, cells, left, behind, by, the, meristem, and, which, have, not, yet, undergone, cellular, differentiation, to, form, a, specialised, tissue, begin, to, grow, as, the, tip, of, a, new, root, or, shoot, growth, from, any, such, meristem, at, the, tip, of, a, root, or, shoot, is, termed, primary, growth, and, results, in, the, lengthening, of, that, root, or, shoot, secondary, growth, results, in, widening, of, a, root, or, shoot, from, divisions, of, cells, in, a, cambium, in, addition, to, growth, by, cell, division, a, plant, may, grow, through, cell, elongation, this, occurs, when, individual, cells, or, groups, of, cells, grow, longer, not, all, plant, cells, will, grow, to, the, same, length, when, cells, on, one, side, of, a, stem, grow, longer, and, faster, than, cells, on, the, other, side, the, stem, will, bend, to, the, side, of, the, slower, growing, cells, as, a, result, this, directional, growth, can, occur, via, a, plant, s, response, to, a, particular, stimulus, such, as, light, phototropism, gravity, gravitropism, water, hydrotropism, and, physical, contact, thigmotropism, plant, growth, and, development, are, mediated, by, specific, plant, hormones, and, plant, growth, regulators, pgrs, ross, et, al, 1983, endogenous, hormone, levels, are, influenced, by, plant, age, cold, hardiness, dormancy, and, other, metabolic, conditions, photoperiod, drought, temperature, and, other, external, environmental, conditions, and, exogenous, sources, of, pgrs, e, g, externally, applied, and, of, rhizospheric, origin, plants, exhibit, natural, variation, in, their, form, and, structure, while, all, organisms, vary, from, individual, to, individual, plants, exhibit, an, additional, type, of, variation, within, a, single, individual, parts, are, repeated, which, may, differ, in, form, and, structure, from, other, similar, parts, this, variation, is, most, easily, seen, in, the, leaves, of, a, plant, though, other, organs, such, as, stems, and, flowers, may, show, similar, variation, there, are, three, primary, causes, of, this, variation, positional, effects, environmental, effects, and, juvenility, transcription, factors, and, transcriptional, regulatory, networks, play, key, roles, in, plant, morphogenesis, and, their, evolution, during, plant, landing, many, novel, transcription, factor, families, emerged, and, are, preferentially, wired, into, the, networks, of, multicellular, development, reproduction, and, organ, development, contributing, to, more, complex, morphogenesis, of, land, plants, although, plants, produce, numerous, copies, of, the, same, organ, during, their, lives, not, all, copies, of, a, particular, organ, will, be, identical, there, is, variation, among, the, parts, of, a, mature, plant, resulting, from, the, relative, position, where, the, organ, is, produced, for, example, along, a, new, branch, the, leaves, may, vary, in, a, consistent, pattern, along, the, branch, the, form, of, leaves, produced, near, the, base, of, the, branch, will, differ, from, leaves, produced, at, the, tip, of, the, plant, and, this, difference, is, consistent, from, branch, to, branch, on, a, given, plant, and, in, a, given, species, this, difference, persists, after, the, leaves, at, both, ends, of, the, branch, have, matured, and, is, not, the, result, of, some, leaves, being, younger, than, others, the, way, in, which, new, structures, mature, as, they, are, produced, may, be, affected, by, the, point, in, the, plant, s, life, when, they, begin, to, develop, as, well, as, by, the, environment, to, which, the, structures, are, exposed, this, can, be, seen, in, aquatic, plants, temperature, has, a, multiplicity, of, effects, on, plants, depending, on, a, variety, of, factors, including, the, size, and, condition, of, the, plant, and, the, temperature, and, duration, of, exposure, the, smaller, and, more, succulent, the, plant, the, greater, the, susceptibility, to, damage, or, death, from, temperatures, that, are, too, high, or, too, low, temperature, affects, the, rate, of, biochemical, and, physiological, processes, rates, generally, within, limits, increasing, with, temperature, however, the, van, t, hoff, relationship, for, monomolecular, reactions, which, states, that, the, velocity, of, a, reaction, is, doubled, or, trebled, by, a, temperature, increase, of, 10, c, does, not, strictly, hold, for, biological, processes, especially, at, low, and, high, temperatures, when, water, freezes, in, plants, the, consequences, for, the, plant, depend, very, much, on, whether, the, freezing, occurs, intracellularly, within, cells, or, outside, cells, in, intercellular, extracellular, spaces, intracellular, freezing, usually, kills, the, cell, regardless, of, the, hardiness, of, the, plant, and, its, tissues, intracellular, freezing, seldom, occurs, in, nature, but, moderate, rates, of, decrease, in, temperature, e, g, 1, c, to, 6, c, hour, cause, intercellular, ice, to, form, and, this, extraorgan, ice, may, or, may, not, be, lethal, depending, on, the, hardiness, of, the, tissue, at, freezing, temperatures, water, in, the, intercellular, spaces, of, plant, tissues, freezes, first, though, the, water, may, remain, unfrozen, until, temperatures, fall, below, 7, c, after, the, initial, formation, of, ice, intercellularly, the, cells, shrink, as, water, is, lost, to, the, segregated, ice, the, cells, undergo, freeze, drying, the, dehydration, being, the, basic, cause, of, freezing, injury, the, rate, of, cooling, has, been, shown, to, influence, the, frost, resistance, of, tissues, but, the, actual, rate, of, freezing, will, depend, not, only, on, the, cooling, rate, but, also, on, the, degree, of, supercooling, and, the, properties, of, the, tissue, sakai, 1979a, demonstrated, ice, segregation, in, shoot, primordia, of, alaskan, white, and, black, spruces, when, cooled, slowly, to, 30, c, to, 40, c, these, freeze, dehydrated, buds, survived, immersion, in, liquid, nitrogen, when, slowly, rewarmed, floral, primordia, responded, similarly, extraorgan, freezing, in, the, primordia, accounts, for, the, ability, of, the, hardiest, of, the, boreal, conifers, to, survive, winters, in, regions, when, air, temperatures, often, fall, to, 50, c, or, lower, the, hardiness, of, the, winter, buds, of, such, conifers, is, enhanced, by, the, smallness, of, the, buds, by, the, evolution, of, faster, translocation, of, water, and, an, ability, to, tolerate, intensive, freeze, dehydration, in, boreal, species, of, picea, and, pinus, the, frost, resistance, of, 1, year, old, seedlings, is, on, a, par, with, mature, plants, given, similar, states, of, dormancy, the, organs, and, tissues, produced, by, a, young, plant, such, as, a, seedling, are, often, different, from, those, that, are, produced, by, the, same, plant, when, it, is, older, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, juvenility, or, heteroblasty, for, example, young, trees, will, produce, longer, leaner, branches, that, grow, upwards, more, than, the, branches, they, will, produce, as, a, fully, grown, tree, in, addition, leaves, produced, during, early, growth, tend, to, be, larger, thinner, and, more, irregular, than, leaves, on, the, adult, plant, specimens, of, juvenile, plants, may, look, so, completely, different, from, adult, plants, of, the, same, species, that, egg, laying, insects, do, not, recognise, the, plant, as, food, for, their, young, differences, are, seen, in, rootability, and, flowering, and, can, be, seen, in, the, same, mature, tree, juvenile, cuttings, taken, from, the, base, of, a, tree, will, form, roots, much, more, readily, than, cuttings, originating, from, the, mid, to, upper, crown, flowering, close, to, the, base, of, a, tree, is, absent, or, less, profuse, than, flowering, in, the, higher, branches, especially, when, a, young, tree, first, reaches, flowering, age, the, transition, from, early, to, late, growth, forms, is, referred, to, as, vegetative, phase, change, but, there, is, some, disagreement, about, terminology, rolf, sattler, has, revised, fundamental, concepts, of, comparative, morphology, such, as, the, concept, of, homology, he, emphasised, that, homology, should, also, include, partial, homology, and, quantitative, homology, this, leads, to, a, continuum, morphology, that, demonstrates, a, continuum, between, the, morphological, categories, of, root, shoot, stem, caulome, leaf, phyllome, and, hair, trichome, how, intermediates, between, the, categories, are, best, described, has, been, discussed, by, bruce, k, kirchoff, et, al, a, recent, study, conducted, by, stalk, institute, extracted, coordinates, corresponding, to, each, plant, s, base, and, leaves, in, 3d, space, when, plants, on, the, graph, were, placed, according, to, their, actual, nutrient, travel, distances, and, total, branch, lengths, the, plants, fell, almost, perfectly, on, the, pareto, curve, this, means, the, way, plants, grow, their, architectures, also, optimises, a, very, common, network, design, tradeoff, based, on, the, environment, and, the, species, the, plant, is, selecting, different, ways, to, make, tradeoffs, for, those, particular, environmental, conditions, honoring, agnes, arber, author, of, the, partial, shoot, theory, of, the, leaf, rutishauser, and, isler, called, the, continuum, approach, fuzzy, arberian, morphology, fam, fuzzy, refers, to, fuzzy, logic, arberian, to, agnes, arber, rutishauser, and, isler, emphasised, that, this, approach, is, not, only, supported, by, many, morphological, data, but, also, by, evidence, from, molecular, genetics, more, recent, evidence, from, molecular, genetics, provides, further, support, for, continuum, morphology, james, 2009, concluded, that, it, is, now, widely, accepted, that, radiality, and, dorsiventrality, are, but, extremes, of, a, continuous, spectrum, in, fact, it, is, simply, the, timing, of, the, knox, gene, expression, eckardt, and, baum, 2010, concluded, that, it, is, now, generally, accepted, that, compound, leaves, express, both, leaf, and, shoot, properties, process, morphology, describes, and, analyses, the, dynamic, continuum, of, plant, form, according, to, this, approach, structures, do, not, have, process, es, they, are, process, es, thus, the, structure, process, dichotomy, is, overcome, by, an, enlargement, of, our, concept, of, structure, so, as, to, include, and, recognise, that, in, the, living, organism, it, is, not, merely, a, question, of, spatial, structure, with, an, activity, as, something, over, or, against, it, but, that, the, concrete, organism, is, a, spatio, temporal, structure, and, that, this, spatio, temporal, structure, is, the, activity, itself, for, jeune, barab, and, lacroix, classical, morphology, that, is, mainstream, morphology, based, on, a, qualitative, homology, concept, implying, mutually, exclusive, categories, and, continuum, morphology, are, sub, classes, of, the, more, encompassing, process, morphology, dynamic, morphology, classical, morphology, continuum, morphology, and, process, morphology, are, highly, relevant, to, plant, evolution, especially, the, field, of, plant, evolutionary, biology, plant, evo, devo, that, tries, to, integrate, plant, morphology, and, plant, molecular, genetics, in, a, detailed, case, study, on, unusual, morphologies, rutishauser, 2016, illustrated, and, discussed, various, topics, of, plant, evo, devo, such, as, the, fuzziness, continuity, of, morphological, concepts, the, lack, of, a, one, to, one, correspondence, between, structural, categories, and, gene, expression, the, notion, of, morphospace, the, adaptive, value, of, bauplan, features, versus, patio, ludens, physiological, adaptations, hopeful, monsters, and, saltational, evolution, the, significance, and, limits, of, developmental, robustness, etc, rutishauser, 2020, discussed, the, past, and, future, of, plant, evo, devo, our, conception, of, the, gynoecium, and, the, search, for, a, fossil, ancestor, of, angiosperms, changes, fundamentally, from, the, perspective, of, evo, devo, whether, we, like, it, or, not, morphological, research, is, influenced, by, philosophical, assumptions, such, as, either, or, logic, fuzzy, logic, structure, process, dualism, or, its, transcendence, and, empirical, findings, may, influence, the, philosophical, assumptions, thus, there, are, interactions, between, philosophy, and, empirical, findings, these, interactions, are, the, subject, of, what, has, been, referred, to, as, philosophy, of, plant, morphology, one, important, and, unique, event, in, plant, morphology, of, the, 21st, century, was, the, publication, of, kaplan, s, principles, of, plant, morphology, by, donald, r, kaplan, edited, by, chelsea, d, specht, 2020, it, is, a, well, illustrated, volume, of, 1305, pages, in, a, very, large, format, that, presents, a, wealth, of, morphological, data, unfortunately, all, of, these, data, are, only, interpreted, in, terms, of, classical, morphology, and, the, qualitative, homology, concept, disregarding, modern, conceptional, innovations, including, continuum, and, process, morphology, as, well, as, molecular, genetics, would, provide, an, enlarged, scope
