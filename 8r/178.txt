fructose, f, r, k, t, o, s, o, z, or, fruit, sugar, is, a, ketonic, simple, sugar, found, in, many, plants, where, it, is, often, bonded, to, glucose, to, form, the, disaccharide, sucrose, it, is, one, of, the, three, dietary, monosaccharides, along, with, glucose, and, galactose, that, are, absorbed, by, the, gut, directly, into, the, blood, of, the, portal, vein, during, digestion, the, liver, then, converts, both, fructose, and, galactose, into, glucose, so, that, dissolved, glucose, known, as, blood, sugar, is, the, only, monosaccharide, present, in, circulating, blood, fructose, was, discovered, by, french, chemist, augustin, pierre, dubrunfaut, in, 1847, the, name, fructose, was, coined, in, 1857, by, the, english, chemist, william, allen, miller, pure, dry, fructose, is, a, sweet, white, odorless, crystalline, solid, and, is, the, most, water, soluble, of, all, the, sugars, fructose, is, found, in, honey, tree, and, vine, fruits, flowers, berries, and, most, root, vegetables, commercially, fructose, is, derived, from, sugar, cane, sugar, beets, and, maize, high, fructose, corn, syrup, is, a, mixture, of, glucose, and, fructose, as, monosaccharides, sucrose, is, a, compound, with, one, molecule, of, glucose, covalently, linked, to, one, molecule, of, fructose, all, forms, of, fructose, including, those, found, in, fruits, and, juices, are, commonly, added, to, foods, and, drinks, for, palatability, and, taste, enhancement, and, for, browning, of, some, foods, such, as, baked, goods, as, of, 2004, about, 240, 000, tonnes, of, crystalline, fructose, were, being, produced, annually, excessive, consumption, of, sugars, including, fructose, especially, from, sugar, sweetened, beverages, may, contribute, to, insulin, resistance, obesity, elevated, ldl, cholesterol, and, triglycerides, leading, to, metabolic, syndrome, the, european, food, safety, authority, efsa, stated, in, 2011, that, fructose, may, be, preferable, over, sucrose, and, glucose, in, sugar, sweetened, foods, and, beverages, because, of, its, lower, effect, on, postprandial, blood, sugar, levels, while, also, noting, the, potential, downside, that, high, intakes, of, fructose, may, lead, to, metabolic, complications, such, as, dyslipidaemia, insulin, resistance, and, increased, visceral, adiposity, the, uk, s, scientific, advisory, committee, on, nutrition, in, 2015, disputed, the, claims, of, fructose, causing, metabolic, disorders, stating, that, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, demonstrate, that, fructose, intake, at, levels, consumed, in, the, normal, uk, diet, leads, to, adverse, health, outcomes, independent, of, any, effects, related, to, its, presence, as, a, component, of, total, and, free, sugars, the, word, fructose, was, coined, in, 1857, from, the, latin, for, fructus, fruit, and, the, generic, chemical, suffix, for, sugars, ose, it, is, also, called, fruit, sugar, and, levulose, or, laevulose, due, to, its, ability, to, rotate, plane, polarised, light, in, a, laevorotary, fashion, anti, clockwise, to, the, left, when, a, beam, is, shone, through, it, in, solution, likewise, dextrose, an, isomer, of, glucose, is, given, its, name, due, to, its, ability, to, rotate, plane, polarised, light, in, a, dextrorotary, fashion, clockwise, to, the, right, fructose, is, a, 6, carbon, polyhydroxyketone, crystalline, fructose, adopts, a, cyclic, six, membered, structure, called, d, fructopyranose, owing, to, the, stability, of, its, hemiketal, and, internal, hydrogen, bonding, in, solution, fructose, exists, as, an, equilibrium, mixture, of, the, tautomers, d, fructo, pyranose, d, fructo, furanose, d, fructofuranose, d, fructopyranose, and, keto, d, fructose, the, non, cyclic, form, the, distribution, of, d, fructose, tautomers, in, solution, is, related, to, several, variables, such, as, solvent, and, temperature, d, fructopyranose, and, d, fructofuranose, distributions, in, water, have, been, identified, multiple, times, as, roughly, 70, fructopyranose, and, 22, fructofuranose, fructose, may, be, anaerobically, fermented, by, yeast, and, bacteria, yeast, enzymes, convert, sugar, sucrose, glucose, and, fructose, but, not, lactose, to, ethanol, and, carbon, dioxide, some, of, the, carbon, dioxide, produced, during, fermentation, will, remain, dissolved, in, water, where, it, will, reach, equilibrium, with, carbonic, acid, the, dissolved, carbon, dioxide, and, carbonic, acid, produce, the, carbonation, in, some, fermented, beverages, such, as, champagne, fructose, undergoes, the, maillard, reaction, non, enzymatic, browning, with, amino, acids, because, fructose, exists, to, a, greater, extent, in, the, open, chain, form, than, does, glucose, the, initial, stages, of, the, maillard, reaction, occur, more, rapidly, than, with, glucose, therefore, fructose, has, potential, to, contribute, to, changes, in, food, palatability, as, well, as, other, nutritional, effects, such, as, excessive, browning, volume, and, tenderness, reduction, during, cake, preparation, and, formation, of, mutagenic, compounds, fructose, readily, dehydrates, to, give, hydroxymethylfurfural, hmf, c, 6, h, 6, o, 3, which, can, be, processed, into, liquid, dimethylfuran, c, 6, h, 8, o, this, process, in, the, future, may, become, part, of, a, low, cost, carbon, neutral, system, to, produce, replacements, for, petrol, and, diesel, from, plants, the, primary, reason, that, fructose, is, used, commercially, in, foods, and, beverages, besides, its, low, cost, is, its, high, relative, sweetness, it, is, the, sweetest, of, all, naturally, occurring, carbohydrates, the, relative, sweetness, of, fructose, has, been, reported, in, the, range, of, 1, 2, 1, 8, times, that, of, sucrose, however, it, is, the, 6, membered, ring, form, of, fructose, that, is, sweeter, the, 5, membered, ring, form, tastes, about, the, same, as, usual, table, sugar, warming, fructose, leads, to, formation, of, the, 5, membered, ring, form, therefore, the, relative, sweetness, decreases, with, increasing, temperature, however, it, has, been, observed, that, the, absolute, sweetness, of, fructose, is, identical, at, 5, c, as, 50, c, and, thus, the, relative, sweetness, to, sucrose, is, not, due, to, anomeric, distribution, but, a, decrease, in, the, absolute, sweetness, of, sucrose, at, higher, temperatures, the, sweetness, of, fructose, is, perceived, earlier, than, that, of, sucrose, or, glucose, and, the, taste, sensation, reaches, a, peak, higher, than, that, of, sucrose, and, diminishes, more, quickly, than, that, of, sucrose, fructose, can, also, enhance, other, flavors, in, the, system, fructose, exhibits, a, sweetness, synergy, effect, when, used, in, combination, with, other, sweeteners, the, relative, sweetness, of, fructose, blended, with, sucrose, aspartame, or, saccharin, is, perceived, to, be, greater, than, the, sweetness, calculated, from, individual, components, fructose, has, higher, water, solubility, than, other, sugars, as, well, as, other, sugar, alcohols, fructose, is, therefore, difficult, to, crystallize, from, an, aqueous, solution, sugar, mixes, containing, fructose, such, as, candies, are, softer, than, those, containing, other, sugars, because, of, the, greater, solubility, of, fructose, fructose, is, quicker, to, absorb, moisture, and, slower, to, release, it, to, the, environment, than, sucrose, glucose, or, other, nutritive, sweeteners, fructose, is, an, excellent, humectant, and, retains, moisture, for, a, long, period, of, time, even, at, low, relative, humidity, rh, therefore, fructose, can, contribute, a, more, palatable, texture, and, longer, shelf, life, to, the, food, products, in, which, it, is, used, fructose, has, a, greater, effect, on, freezing, point, depression, than, disaccharides, or, oligosaccharides, which, may, protect, the, integrity, of, cell, walls, of, fruit, by, reducing, ice, crystal, formation, however, this, characteristic, may, be, undesirable, in, soft, serve, or, hard, frozen, dairy, desserts, fructose, increases, starch, viscosity, more, rapidly, and, achieves, a, higher, final, viscosity, than, sucrose, because, fructose, lowers, the, temperature, required, during, gelatinizing, of, starch, causing, a, greater, final, viscosity, although, some, artificial, sweeteners, are, not, suitable, for, home, baking, many, traditional, recipes, use, fructose, natural, sources, of, fructose, include, fruits, vegetables, including, sugar, cane, and, honey, fructose, is, often, further, concentrated, from, these, sources, the, highest, dietary, sources, of, fructose, besides, pure, crystalline, fructose, are, foods, containing, white, sugar, sucrose, high, fructose, corn, syrup, agave, nectar, honey, molasses, maple, syrup, fruit, and, fruit, juices, as, these, have, the, highest, percentages, of, fructose, including, fructose, in, sucrose, per, serving, compared, to, other, common, foods, and, ingredients, fructose, exists, in, foods, either, as, a, free, monosaccharide, or, bound, to, glucose, as, sucrose, a, disaccharide, fructose, glucose, and, sucrose, may, all, be, present, in, food, however, different, foods, will, have, varying, levels, of, each, of, these, three, sugars, the, sugar, contents, of, common, fruits, and, vegetables, are, presented, in, table, 1, in, general, in, foods, that, contain, free, fructose, the, ratio, of, fructose, to, glucose, is, approximately, 1, 1, that, is, foods, with, fructose, usually, contain, about, an, equal, amount, of, free, glucose, a, value, that, is, above, 1, indicates, a, higher, proportion, of, fructose, to, glucose, and, below, 1, a, lower, proportion, some, fruits, have, larger, proportions, of, fructose, to, glucose, compared, to, others, for, example, apples, and, pears, contain, more, than, twice, as, much, free, fructose, as, glucose, while, for, apricots, the, proportion, is, less, than, half, as, much, fructose, as, glucose, apple, and, pear, juices, are, of, particular, interest, to, pediatricians, because, the, high, concentrations, of, free, fructose, in, these, juices, can, cause, diarrhea, in, children, the, cells, enterocytes, that, line, children, s, small, intestines, have, less, affinity, for, fructose, absorption, than, for, glucose, and, sucrose, unabsorbed, fructose, creates, higher, osmolarity, in, the, small, intestine, which, draws, water, into, the, gastrointestinal, tract, resulting, in, osmotic, diarrhea, this, phenomenon, is, discussed, in, greater, detail, in, the, health, effects, section, table, 1, also, shows, the, amount, of, sucrose, found, in, common, fruits, and, vegetables, sugarcane, and, sugar, beet, have, a, high, concentration, of, sucrose, and, are, used, for, commercial, preparation, of, pure, sucrose, extracted, cane, or, beet, juice, is, clarified, removing, impurities, and, concentrated, by, removing, excess, water, the, end, product, is, 99, 9, pure, sucrose, sucrose, containing, sugars, include, common, white, sugar, and, powdered, sugar, as, well, as, brown, sugar, all, data, with, a, unit, of, g, gram, are, based, on, 100, g, of, a, food, item, the, fructose, glucose, ratio, is, calculated, by, dividing, the, sum, of, free, fructose, plus, half, sucrose, by, the, sum, of, free, glucose, plus, half, sucrose, fructose, is, also, found, in, the, manufactured, sweetener, high, fructose, corn, syrup, hfcs, which, is, produced, by, treating, corn, syrup, with, enzymes, converting, glucose, into, fructose, the, common, designations, for, fructose, content, hfcs, 42, and, hfcs, 55, indicate, the, percentage, of, fructose, present, in, hfcs, hfcs, 55, is, commonly, used, as, a, sweetener, for, soft, drinks, whereas, hfcs, 42, is, used, to, sweeten, processed, foods, breakfast, cereals, bakery, foods, and, some, soft, drinks, for, hfcs, and, usda, for, fruits, and, vegetables, and, the, other, refined, sugars, cane, and, beet, sugars, have, been, used, as, the, major, sweetener, in, food, manufacturing, for, centuries, however, with, the, development, of, hfcs, a, significant, shift, occurred, in, the, type, of, sweetener, consumption, in, certain, countries, particularly, the, united, states, contrary, to, the, popular, belief, however, with, the, increase, of, hfcs, consumption, the, total, fructose, intake, relative, to, the, total, glucose, intake, has, not, dramatically, changed, granulated, sugar, is, 99, 9, pure, sucrose, which, means, that, it, has, equal, ratio, of, fructose, to, glucose, the, most, commonly, used, forms, of, hfcs, hfcs, 42, and, hfcs, 55, have, a, roughly, equal, ratio, of, fructose, to, glucose, with, minor, differences, hfcs, has, simply, replaced, sucrose, as, a, sweetener, therefore, despite, the, changes, in, the, sweetener, consumption, the, ratio, of, glucose, to, fructose, intake, has, remained, relatively, constant, providing, 368, kcal, per, 100, grams, of, dry, powder, table, fructose, has, 95, the, caloric, value, of, sucrose, by, weight, fructose, powder, is, 100, carbohydrates, and, supplies, no, other, nutrients, in, significant, amount, table, fructose, exists, in, foods, either, as, a, monosaccharide, free, fructose, or, as, a, unit, of, a, disaccharide, sucrose, free, fructose, is, a, ketonic, simple, sugar, and, one, of, the, three, dietary, monosaccharides, absorbed, directly, by, the, intestine, when, fructose, is, consumed, in, the, form, of, sucrose, it, is, digested, broken, down, and, then, absorbed, as, free, fructose, as, sucrose, comes, into, contact, with, the, membrane, of, the, small, intestine, the, enzyme, sucrase, catalyzes, the, cleavage, of, sucrose, to, yield, one, glucose, unit, and, one, fructose, unit, which, are, then, each, absorbed, after, absorption, it, enters, the, hepatic, portal, vein, and, is, directed, toward, the, liver, the, mechanism, of, fructose, absorption, in, the, small, intestine, is, not, completely, understood, some, evidence, suggests, active, transport, because, fructose, uptake, has, been, shown, to, occur, against, a, concentration, gradient, however, the, majority, of, research, supports, the, claim, that, fructose, absorption, occurs, on, the, mucosal, membrane, via, facilitated, transport, involving, glut5, transport, proteins, since, the, concentration, of, fructose, is, higher, in, the, lumen, fructose, is, able, to, flow, down, a, concentration, gradient, into, the, enterocytes, assisted, by, transport, proteins, fructose, may, be, transported, out, of, the, enterocyte, across, the, basolateral, membrane, by, either, glut2, or, glut5, although, the, glut2, transporter, has, a, greater, capacity, for, transporting, fructose, and, therefore, the, majority, of, fructose, is, transported, out, of, the, enterocyte, through, glut2, the, absorption, capacity, for, fructose, in, monosaccharide, form, ranges, from, less, than, 5, g, to, 50, g, per, individual, serving, and, adapts, with, changes, in, dietary, fructose, intake, studies, show, the, greatest, absorption, rate, occurs, when, glucose, and, fructose, are, administered, in, equal, quantities, when, fructose, is, ingested, as, part, of, the, disaccharide, sucrose, absorption, capacity, is, much, higher, because, fructose, exists, in, a, 1, 1, ratio, with, glucose, it, appears, that, the, glut5, transfer, rate, may, be, saturated, at, low, levels, and, absorption, is, increased, through, joint, absorption, with, glucose, one, proposed, mechanism, for, this, phenomenon, is, a, glucose, dependent, cotransport, of, fructose, in, addition, fructose, transfer, activity, increases, with, dietary, fructose, intake, the, presence, of, fructose, in, the, lumen, causes, increased, mrna, transcription, of, glut5, leading, to, increased, transport, proteins, high, fructose, diets, 2, 4, g, kg, body, wt, increase, the, transport, proteins, within, three, days, of, intake, several, studies, have, measured, the, intestinal, absorption, of, fructose, using, the, hydrogen, breath, test, these, studies, indicate, that, fructose, is, not, completely, absorbed, in, the, small, intestine, when, fructose, is, not, absorbed, in, the, small, intestine, it, is, transported, into, the, large, intestine, where, it, is, fermented, by, the, colonic, flora, hydrogen, is, produced, during, the, fermentation, process, and, dissolves, into, the, blood, of, the, portal, vein, this, hydrogen, is, transported, to, the, lungs, where, it, is, exchanged, across, the, lungs, and, is, measurable, by, the, hydrogen, breath, test, the, colonic, flora, also, produces, carbon, dioxide, short, chain, fatty, acids, organic, acids, and, trace, gases, in, the, presence, of, unabsorbed, fructose, the, presence, of, gases, and, organic, acids, in, the, large, intestine, causes, gastrointestinal, symptoms, such, as, bloating, diarrhea, flatulence, and, gastrointestinal, pain, exercise, immediately, after, consumption, can, exacerbate, these, symptoms, by, decreasing, transit, time, in, the, small, intestine, resulting, in, a, greater, amount, of, fructose, emptied, into, the, large, intestine, all, three, dietary, monosaccharides, are, transported, into, the, liver, by, the, glut2, transporter, fructose, and, galactose, are, phosphorylated, in, the, liver, by, fructokinase, k, m, 0, 5, mm, and, galactokinase, k, m, 0, 8, mm, respectively, by, contrast, glucose, tends, to, pass, through, the, liver, k, m, of, hepatic, glucokinase, 10, mm, and, can, be, metabolised, anywhere, in, the, body, uptake, of, fructose, by, the, liver, is, not, regulated, by, insulin, however, insulin, is, capable, of, increasing, the, abundance, and, functional, activity, of, glut5, fructose, transporter, in, skeletal, muscle, cells, the, initial, catabolism, of, fructose, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, fructolysis, in, analogy, with, glycolysis, the, catabolism, of, glucose, in, fructolysis, the, enzyme, fructokinase, initially, produces, fructose, 1, phosphate, which, is, split, by, aldolase, b, to, produce, the, trioses, dihydroxyacetone, phosphate, dhap, and, glyceraldehyde, unlike, glycolysis, in, fructolysis, the, triose, glyceraldehyde, lacks, a, phosphate, group, a, third, enzyme, triokinase, is, therefore, required, to, phosphorylate, glyceraldehyde, producing, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, the, resulting, trioses, are, identical, to, those, obtained, in, glycolysis, and, can, enter, the, gluconeogenic, pathway, for, glucose, or, glycogen, synthesis, or, be, further, catabolized, through, the, lower, glycolytic, pathway, to, pyruvate, the, first, step, in, the, metabolism, of, fructose, is, the, phosphorylation, of, fructose, to, fructose, 1, phosphate, by, fructokinase, thus, trapping, fructose, for, metabolism, in, the, liver, fructose, 1, phosphate, then, undergoes, hydrolysis, by, aldolase, b, to, form, dhap, and, glyceraldehydes, dhap, can, either, be, isomerized, to, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, by, triosephosphate, isomerase, or, undergo, reduction, to, glycerol, 3, phosphate, by, glycerol, 3, phosphate, dehydrogenase, the, glyceraldehyde, produced, may, also, be, converted, to, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, by, glyceraldehyde, kinase, or, further, converted, to, glycerol, 3, phosphate, by, glycerol, 3, phosphate, dehydrogenase, the, metabolism, of, fructose, at, this, point, yields, intermediates, in, the, gluconeogenic, pathway, leading, to, glycogen, synthesis, as, well, as, fatty, acid, and, triglyceride, synthesis, the, resultant, glyceraldehyde, formed, by, aldolase, b, then, undergoes, phosphorylation, to, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, increased, concentrations, of, dhap, and, glyceraldehyde, 3, phosphate, in, the, liver, drive, the, gluconeogenic, pathway, toward, glucose, and, subsequent, glycogen, synthesis, it, appears, that, fructose, is, a, better, substrate, for, glycogen, synthesis, than, glucose, and, that, glycogen, replenishment, takes, precedence, over, triglyceride, formation, once, liver, glycogen, is, replenished, the, intermediates, of, fructose, metabolism, are, primarily, directed, toward, triglyceride, synthesis, carbons, from, dietary, fructose, are, found, in, both, the, free, fatty, acid, and, glycerol, moieties, of, plasma, triglycerides, high, fructose, consumption, can, lead, to, excess, pyruvate, production, causing, a, buildup, of, krebs, cycle, intermediates, accumulated, citrate, can, be, transported, from, the, mitochondria, into, the, cytosol, of, hepatocytes, converted, to, acetyl, coa, by, citrate, lyase, and, directed, toward, fatty, acid, synthesis, in, addition, dhap, can, be, converted, to, glycerol, 3, phosphate, providing, the, glycerol, backbone, for, the, triglyceride, molecule, triglycerides, are, incorporated, into, very, low, density, lipoproteins, vldl, which, are, released, from, the, liver, destined, toward, peripheral, tissues, for, storage, in, both, fat, and, muscle, cells, in, 2022, the, european, food, safety, authority, stated, that, there, is, research, evidence, that, fructose, and, other, added, free, sugars, may, be, associated, with, increased, risk, of, several, chronic, diseases, the, risk, is, moderate, for, obesity, and, dyslipidemia, more, than, 50, and, low, for, non, alcoholic, fatty, liver, disease, type, 2, diabetes, from, 15, to, 50, and, hypertension, efsa, further, stated, that, clinical, research, did, not, support, a, positive, relationship, between, the, intake, of, dietary, sugars, in, isocaloric, exchange, with, other, macronutrients, and, any, of, the, chronic, metabolic, diseases, or, pregnancy, related, endpoints, assessed, but, advised, the, intake, of, added, and, free, sugars, should, be, as, low, as, possible, in, the, context, of, a, nutritionally, adequate, diet, when, fructose, is, consumed, in, excess, as, a, sweetening, agent, in, foods, or, beverages, it, may, be, associated, with, increased, risk, of, obesity, diabetes, and, cardiovascular, disorders, that, are, part, of, metabolic, syndrome, fructose, was, found, to, increase, triglycerides, in, type, 2, but, not, type, 1, diabetes, and, moderate, use, of, it, has, previously, been, considered, acceptable, as, a, sweetener, for, diabetics, possibly, because, it, does, not, trigger, the, production, of, insulin, by, pancreatic, cells, for, a, 50, gram, reference, amount, fructose, has, a, glycemic, index, of, 23, compared, with, 100, for, glucose, and, 60, for, sucrose, fructose, is, also, 73, sweeter, than, sucrose, at, room, temperature, allowing, diabetics, to, use, less, of, it, per, serving, fructose, consumed, before, a, meal, may, reduce, the, glycemic, response, of, the, meal, fructose, sweetened, food, and, beverage, products, cause, less, of, a, rise, in, blood, glucose, levels, than, do, those, manufactured, with, either, sucrose, or, glucose
