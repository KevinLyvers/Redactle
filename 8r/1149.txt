lavandula, common, name, lavender, is, a, genus, of, 47, known, species, of, perennial, flowering, plants, in, the, mints, family, lamiaceae, it, is, native, to, the, old, world, primarily, found, across, the, drier, warmer, regions, of, mainland, eurasia, with, an, affinity, for, maritime, breezes, lavender, is, found, on, the, iberian, peninsula, and, around, the, entirety, of, the, mediterranean, coastline, including, the, adriatic, coast, the, balkans, the, levant, and, coastal, north, africa, in, parts, of, eastern, and, southern, africa, and, the, middle, east, as, well, as, in, south, asia, and, on, the, indian, subcontinent, many, members, of, the, genus, are, cultivated, extensively, in, temperate, climates, as, ornamental, plants, for, garden, and, landscape, use, for, use, as, culinary, herbs, and, also, commercially, for, the, extraction, of, essential, oils, lavender, is, used, in, traditional, medicine, and, as, an, ingredient, in, cosmetics, the, genus, includes, annual, or, short, lived, herbaceous, perennial, plants, and, shrub, like, perennials, subshrubs, or, small, shrubs, leaf, shape, is, diverse, across, the, genus, they, are, simple, in, some, commonly, cultivated, species, in, other, species, they, are, pinnately, toothed, or, pinnate, sometimes, multiple, pinnate, and, dissected, in, most, species, the, leaves, are, covered, in, fine, hairs, or, indumentum, which, normally, contain, essential, oils, flowers, are, contained, in, whorls, held, on, spikes, rising, above, the, foliage, the, spikes, being, branched, in, some, species, some, species, produce, colored, bracts, at, the, tips, of, the, inflorescences, the, flowers, may, be, blue, violet, or, lilac, in, the, wild, species, occasionally, blackish, purple, or, yellowish, the, sepal, calyx, is, tubular, the, corolla, is, also, tubular, usually, with, five, lobes, the, upper, lip, often, cleft, and, the, lower, lip, has, two, clefts, lavandula, stoechas, l, pedunculata, and, l, dentata, were, known, in, roman, times, 51, from, the, middle, ages, onwards, the, european, species, were, considered, two, separate, groups, or, genera, stoechas, l, stoechas, l, pedunculata, l, dentata, and, lavandula, l, spica, and, l, latifolia, until, linnaeus, combined, them, he, recognised, only, five, species, in, species, plantarum, 1753, l, multifida, and, l, dentata, spain, and, l, stoechas, and, l, spica, from, southern, europe, l, pedunculata, was, included, within, l, stoechas, by, 1790, l, pinnata, and, l, carnosa, were, recognised, the, latter, was, subsequently, transferred, to, anisochilus, by, 1826, fr, d, ric, charles, jean, gingins, de, la, sarraz, listed, 12, species, in, three, sections, and, by, 1848, eighteen, species, were, known, 51, one, of, the, first, modern, major, classifications, was, that, of, dorothy, chaytor, in, 1937, at, kew, the, six, sections, she, proposed, for, 28, species, still, left, many, intermediates, that, could, not, easily, be, assigned, her, sections, included, stoechas, spica, subnudae, pterostoechas, chaetostachys, and, dentatae, however, all, the, major, cultivated, and, commercial, forms, resided, in, the, stoechas, and, spica, sections, there, were, four, species, within, stoechas, lavandula, stoechas, l, dentata, l, viridis, and, l, pedunculata, while, spica, had, three, l, officinalis, now, l, angustifolia, l, latifolia, and, l, lanata, she, believed, that, the, garden, varieties, were, hybrids, between, true, lavender, l, angustifolia, and, spike, lavender, l, latifolia, lavandula, has, three, subgenera, in, addition, there, are, numerous, hybrids, and, cultivars, in, commercial, and, horticultural, usage, the, first, major, clade, corresponds, to, subgenus, lavandula, and, the, second, fabricia, the, sabaudia, group, is, less, clearly, defined, within, the, lavandula, clade, the, subclades, correspond, to, the, existing, sections, but, place, dentatae, separately, from, stoechas, not, within, it, within, the, fabricia, clade, the, subclades, correspond, to, pterostoechas, subnudae, and, chaetostachys, thus, the, current, classification, includes, 39, species, distributed, across, 8, sections, the, original, 6, of, chaytor, and, the, two, new, sections, of, upson, and, andrews, in, three, subgenera, see, table, below, however, since, lavender, cross, pollinates, easily, countless, variations, present, difficulties, in, classification, the, english, word, lavender, came, into, use, in, the, 13th, century, and, is, generally, thought, to, derive, from, old, french, lavandre, ultimately, from, latin, lavare, from, lavo, to, wash, referring, to, the, use, of, blue, infusions, of, the, plants, for, bathing, 35, the, botanic, name, lavandula, as, used, by, linnaeus, is, considered, to, be, derived, from, this, and, other, european, vernacular, names, for, the, plants, the, names, widely, used, for, some, of, the, species, english, lavender, french, lavender, and, spanish, lavender, are, all, imprecisely, applied, english, lavender, is, commonly, used, for, l, angustifolia, though, some, references, say, the, proper, term, is, old, english, lavender, the, name, french, lavender, may, refer, to, either, l, stoechas, or, to, l, dentata, spanish, lavender, may, refer, to, l, pedunculata, l, stoechas, or, l, lanata, the, most, common, form, in, cultivation, is, the, common, or, english, lavender, lavandula, angustifolia, formerly, named, l, officinalis, a, wide, range, of, cultivars, can, be, found, other, commonly, grown, ornamental, species, are, l, stoechas, l, dentata, and, l, multifida, egyptian, lavender, because, the, cultivated, forms, are, planted, in, gardens, worldwide, they, are, occasionally, found, growing, wild, as, garden, escapes, well, beyond, their, natural, range, such, spontaneous, growth, is, usually, harmless, but, in, some, cases, lavandula, species, have, become, invasive, for, example, in, australia, l, stoechas, has, become, a, cause, for, concern, it, occurs, widely, throughout, the, continent, and, has, been, declared, a, noxious, weed, in, victoria, since, 1920, it, is, regarded, as, a, weed, in, parts, of, spain, lavenders, flourish, best, in, dry, well, drained, sandy, or, gravelly, soils, in, full, sun, english, lavender, has, a, long, germination, process, 14, 28, days, and, matures, within, 100, 110, days, all, types, need, little, or, no, fertilizer, and, good, air, circulation, in, areas, of, high, humidity, root, rot, due, to, fungus, infection, can, be, a, problem, organic, mulches, can, trap, moisture, around, the, plants, bases, encouraging, root, rot, gravelly, materials, such, as, crushed, rocks, give, better, results,

and, topical, applications, lavandula, intermedia, also, known, as, lavandin, or, dutch, lavender, hybrids, of, l, angustifolia, and, l, latifolia, are, widely, cultivated, for, commercial, use, since, their, flowers, tend, to, be, bigger, than, those, of, english, lavender, and, the, plants, tend, to, be, easier, to, harvest, they, yield, a, similar, essential, oil, but, with, higher, levels, of, terpenes, including, camphor, which, add, a, sharper, overtone, to, the, fragrance, regarded, by, some, as, of, lower, quality, than, that, of, english, lavender, the, us, food, and, drug,
