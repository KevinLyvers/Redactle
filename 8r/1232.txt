practitioner, such, as, a, physician, who, may, write, the, prescription, for, the, required, drug, many, prescriptions, issued, by, health, practitioners, in, australia, are, covered, by, the, pharmaceutical, benefits, scheme, a, scheme, that, provides, subsidised, prescription, drugs, to, residents, of, australia, to, ensure, that, all, australians, have, affordable, and, reliable, access,

patient, can, consolidate, prescription, charges, by, using, a, prescription, payment, certificate, informally, a, season, ticket, effectively, capping, costs, at, 31, 25, a, quarter, or, 111, 60, for, a, year, outside, the, nhs, private, prescriptions, are, issued, by, private, medical, practitioner, and, sometimes, under, the, nhs, for, medicines, that, are, not, covered, by, the, nhs, a, patient, pays, the, pharmacy, the, normal, price, for, medicine, prescribed, outside, the, nhs, survey, results, published, by, ipsos, mori, in, 2008, found, that, around, 800, 000, people, in, england, were, not, collecting, prescriptions, or, getting, them, dispensed, because, of, the, cost, the, same, as, in, 2001, in, the, united, states, the, federal, food, drug, and, cosmetic, act, defines, what, substances, known, as, legend, drugs, require, a, prescription, for, them, to, be, dispensed, by, a, pharmacy, the, federal, government, authorizes, physicians, of, any, specialty, physician, assistants, nurse, practitioners, and, other, advanced, practice, nurses, veterinarians, dentists, and, optometrists, to, prescribe, any, controlled, substance, they, are, issued, unique, dea, numbers, many, other, mental, and, physical, health, technicians, including, basic, level, registered, nurses, medical, assistants, emergency, medical, technicians, most, psychologists, and,

and, distribution, of, controlled, substances, which, are, drugs, with, potential, for, abuse, or, addiction, the, legislation, classifies, these, drugs, into, five, schedules, with, varying, qualifications, for, each, schedule, the, schedules, are, designated, schedule, i, schedule, ii, schedule, iii, schedule, iv, and, schedule, v, many, drugs, other, than, controlled, substances, require, a, prescription, the, safety, and, the, effectiveness, of, prescription, drugs, in, the, us, are, regulated, by, the, 1987, prescription, drug, marketing, act, pdma, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, is, charged, with, implementing, the, law, as, a, general, rule, over, the, counter, drugs, otc, are, used, to, treat, a, condition, that, does, not, need, care, from, a, healthcare, professional, if, have, been, proven, to, meet, higher, safety, standards, for, self, medication, by, patients, often, a, lower, strength, of, a, drug, will, be, approved, for, otc, use, but, higher, strengths, require, a, prescription, to, be, obtained, a, notable, case, is, ibuprofen, which, has, been, widely, available, as, an, otc, pain, killer, since, the, mid, 1980s, but, it, is, available, by, prescription, in, doses, up, to, four, times, the, otc, dose, for, severe, pain, that, is, not, adequately, controlled, by, the, otc, strength, herbal, preparations, amino, acids, vitamins, minerals, and, other, food, supplements, are, regulated, by, the, fda, as, dietary, supplements, because, specific, health, claims, cannot, be, made, the, consumer, must, make, informed, decisions, when, purchasing, such, products, by, law, american, pharmacies, operated, by, membership, clubs, such, as, costco, and, sam, s, club, must, allow, non, members, to, use, their, pharmacy, services, and, may, not, charge, more, for, these, services, than, they, charge, as, their, members, physicians, may, legally, prescribe, drugs, for, uses, other, than, those, specified, in, the, fda, approval, known, as, off, label, use, drug, companies, however, are, prohibited, from, marketing, their, drugs, for, off, label, uses, some, prescription, drugs, are, commonly, abused, particularly, those, marketed, as, analgesics, including, fentanyl, duragesic, hydrocodone, vicodin, oxycodone, oxycontin, oxymorphone, opana, propoxyphene, darvon, hydromorphone, dilaudid, meperidine, demerol, and, diphenoxylate, lomotil, some, prescription, painkillers, have, been, found, to, be, addictive, and, unintentional, poisoning, deaths, in, the, united, states, have, skyrocketed, since, the, 1990s, according, to, the, national, safety, council, prescriber, education, guidelines, as, well, as, patient, education, prescription, drug, monitoring, programs, and, regulation, of, pain, clinics, are, regulatory, tactics, which, have, been, used, to, curtail, opioid, use, and, misuse, the, expiration, date, required, in, several, countries, specifies, the, date, up, to, which, the, manufacturer, guarantees, the, full, potency, and, safety, of, a, drug, in, the, united, states, expiration, dates, are, determined, by, regulations, established, by, the, fda, the, fda, advises, consumers, not, to, use, products, after, their, expiration, dates, a, study, conducted, by, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, covered, over, 100, drugs, prescription, and, over, the, counter, the, results, showed, that, about, 90, of, them, were, safe, and, effective, far, past, their, original, expiration, date, at, least, one, drug, worked, 15, years, after, its, expiration, date, joel, davis, a, former, fda, expiration, date, compliance, chief, said, that, with, a, handful, of, exceptions, notably, nitroglycerin, insulin, and, some, liquid, antibiotics, outdated, tetracyclines, can, cause, fanconi, syndrome, most, expired, drugs, are, probably, effective, the, american, medical, association, issued, a, report, and, statement, on, pharmaceutical, expiration, dates, the, harvard, medical, school, family, health, guide, notes, that, with, rare, exceptions, it, s, true, the, effectiveness, of, a, drug, may, decrease, over, time, but, much, of, the, original, potency, still, remains, even, a, decade, after, the, expiration, date, the, expiration, date, is, the, final, day, that, the, manufacturer, guarantees, the, full, potency, and, safety, of, a, medication, drug, expiration, dates, exist, on, most, medication, labels, including, prescription, over, the, counter, and, dietary, supplements, u, s, pharmaceutical, manufacturers, are, required, by, law, to, place, expiration, dates, on, prescription, products, prior, to, marketing, for, legal, and, liability, reasons, manufacturers, will, not, make, recommendations, about, the, stability, of, drugs, past, the, original, expiration, date, prices, of, prescription, drugs, vary, widely, around, the, world, prescription, costs, for, biosimilar, and, generic, drugs, are, usually, less, than, brand, names, but, the, cost, is, different, from, one, pharmacy, to, another, to, lower, prescription, drug, costs, some, u, s, states, have, sought, federal, approval, to, buy, drugs, in, canada, as, of, 2022, generics, undergo, strict, scrutiny, to, meet, the, equal, efficacy, safety, dosage, strength, stability, and, quality, of, brand, name, drugs, generics, are, developed, after, the, brand, name, has, already, been, established, and, so, generic, drug, approval, in, many, aspects, has, a, shortened, approval, process, because, it, replicates, the, brand, name, drug, brand, name, drugs, cost, more, due, to, time, money, and, resources, that, drug, companies, invest, in, them, to, conduct, development, including, clinical, trials, that, the, fda, requires, for, the, drug, to, be, marketed, because, drug, companies, have, to, invest, more, in, research, costs, to, do, this, brand, name, drug, prices, are, much, higher, when, sold, to, consumers, when, the, patent, expires, for, a, brand, name, drug, generic, versions, of, that, drug, are, produced, by, other, companies, and, are, sold, for, lower, price, by, switching, to, generic, prescription, drugs, patients, can, save, significant, amounts, of, money, e, g, one, study, by, the, fda, showed, an, example, with, more, than, 52, savings, of, a, consumer, s, overall, costs, of, their, prescription, drugs, in, the, united, states, there, are, many, resources, available, to, patients, to, lower, the, costs, of, medication, these, include, copayments, coinsurance, and, deductibles, the, medicaid, drug, rebate, program, is, another, example, generic, drug, programs, lower, the, amount, of, money, patients, have, to, pay, when, picking, up, their, prescription, at, the, pharmacy, as, their, name, implies, they, only, cover, generic, drugs, co, pay, assistance, programs, are, programs, that, help, patients, lower, the, costs, of, specialty, medications, i, e, medications, that, are, on, restricted, formularies, have, limited, distribution, and, or, have, no, generic, version, available, these, medications, can, include, drugs, for, hiv, hepatitis, c, and, multiple, sclerosis, patient, assistance, program, center, rxassist, has, a, list, of, foundations, that, provide, co, pay, assistance, programs, co, pay, assistance, programs, are, for, under, insured, patients, patients, without, insurance, are, not, eligible, for, this, resource, however, they, may, be, eligible, for, patient, assistance, programs, patient, assistance, programs, are, funded, by, the, manufacturer, of, the, medication, patients, can, often, apply, to, these, programs, through, the, manufacturer, s, website, this, type, of, assistance, program, is, one, of, the, few, options, available, to, uninsured, patients, the, out, of, pocket, cost, for, patients, enrolled, in, co, pay, assistance, or, patient, assistance, programs, is, 0, it, is, a, major, resource, to, help, lower, costs, of, medications, however, many, providers, and, patients, are, not, aware, of, these, resources, traces, of, prescription, drugs, including, antibiotics, anti, convulsants, mood, stabilizers, and, sex, hormones, have, been, detected, in, drinking, water, pharmaceutically, active, compounds, phacs, discarded, from, human, therapy, and, their, metabolites, may, not, be, eliminated, entirely, by, sewage, treatment, plants, and, have, been, detected, at, low, concentrations, in, surface, waters, downstream, from, those, plants, the, continuous, discarding, of, incompletely, treated, water, may, interact, with, other, environmental, chemicals, and, lead, to, uncertain, ecological, effects, due, to, most, pharmaceuticals, being, highly, soluble, fish, and, other, aquatic, organisms, are, susceptible, to, their, effects, the, long, term, effects, of, pharmaceuticals, in, the, environment, may, affect, survival, and, reproduction, of, such, organisms, however, levels, of, medical, drug, waste, in, the, water, is, at, a, low, enough, level, that, it, is, not, a, direct, concern, to, human, health, however, processes, such, as, biomagnification, are, potential, human, health, concerns, on, the, other, hand, there, is, clear, evidence, of, harm, to, aquatic, animals, and, fauna, recent, advancements, in, technology, have, allowed, scientists, to, detect, smaller, trace, quantities, of, pharmaceuticals, in, the, ng, ml, range, despite, being, found, at, low, concentrations, female, hormonal, contraceptives, may, cause, feminizing, effects, on, male, vertebrate, species, such, as, fish, frogs, and, crocodiles, the, fda, established, guidelines, in, 2007, to, inform, consumers, should, dispose, of, prescription, drugs, when, medications, do, not, include, specific, disposal, instructions, patients, should, not, flush, medications, in, the, toilet, but, instead, use, medication, take, back, programs, to, reduce, the, amount, of, pharmaceutical, waste, in, sewage, and, landfills, if, no, take, back, programs, are, available, prescription, drugs, can, be, discarded, in, household, trash, after, they, are, crushed, or, dissolved, and, then, mixed, in, a, separate, container, or, sealable, bag, with, undesirable, substances, like, cat, litter, or, other, unappealing, material, to, discourage, consumption
