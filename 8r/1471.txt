psychopathy, or, psychopathic, personality, is, a, personality, construct, characterized, by, impaired, empathy, and, remorse, and, bold, disinhibited, and, egocentric, traits, masked, by, superficial, charm, and, the, outward, appearance, of, apparent, normalcy, hervey, m, cleckley, an, american, psychiatrist, influenced, the, initial, diagnostic, criteria, for, antisocial, personality, reaction, disturbance, in, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, as, did, american, psychologist, george, e, partridge, the, dsm, and, international, classification, of, diseases, icd, subsequently, introduced, the, diagnoses, of, antisocial, personality, disorder, aspd, and, dissocial, personality, disorder, dpd, respectively, stating, that, these, diagnoses, have, been, referred, to, or, include, what, is, referred, to, as, psychopathy, or, sociopathy, the, creation, of, aspd, and, dpd, was, driven, by, the, fact, that, many, of, the, classic, traits, of, psychopathy, were, impossible, to, measure, objectively, canadian, psychologist, robert, d, hare, later, re, popularized, the, construct, of, psychopathy, in, criminology, with, his, psychopathy, checklist, although, no, psychiatric, or, psychological, organization, has, sanctioned, a, diagnosis, titled, psychopathy, assessments, of, psychopathic, characteristics, are, widely, used, in, criminal, justice, settings, in, some, nations, and, may, have, important, consequences, for, individuals, the, study, of, psychopathy, is, an, active, field, of, research, the, term, is, also, used, by, the, general, public, popular, press, and, in, fictional, portrayals, while, the, abbreviated, term, psycho, is, often, employed, in, common, usage, in, general, media, along, with, crazy, insane, and, mentally, ill, there, is, a, categorical, difference, between, psychosis, and, psychopathy, the, word, psychopathy, is, a, joining, of, the, greek, words, psyche, soul, and, pathos, suffering, feeling, the, first, documented, use, is, from, 1847, in, germany, as, psychopatisch, and, the, noun, psychopath, has, been, traced, to, 1885, in, medicine, patho, has, a, more, specific, meaning, of, disease, thus, pathology, has, meant, the, study, of, disease, since, 1610, and, psychopathology, has, meant, the, study, of, mental, disorder, in, general, since, 1847, a, sense, of, a, subject, of, pathology, morbid, excessive, is, attested, from, 1845, including, the, phrase, pathological, liar, from, 1891, in, the, medical, literature, the, term, psychopathy, initially, had, a, very, general, meaning, referring, to, all, sorts, of, mental, disorders, and, social, aberrations, popularised, from, 1891, in, germany, by, koch, s, concept, of, psychopathic, inferiority, psychopathische, minderwertigkeiten, some, medical, dictionaries, still, define, psychopathy, in, both, a, narrow, and, broad, sense, such, as, medlineplus, from, the, u, s, national, library, of, medicine, on, the, other, hand, stedman, s, medical, dictionary, defines, psychopath, only, as, a, former, designation, for, a, person, with, an, antisocial, type, of, personality, disorder, the, term, psychosis, was, also, used, in, germany, from, 1841, originally, in, a, very, general, sense, the, suffix, osis, meant, in, this, case, abnormal, condition, this, term, or, its, adjective, psychotic, would, come, to, refer, to, the, more, severe, mental, disturbances, and, then, specifically, to, mental, states, or, disorders, characterized, by, hallucinations, delusions, or, in, some, other, sense, markedly, out, of, touch, with, reality, the, slang, term, psycho, has, been, traced, to, a, shortening, of, the, adjective, psychopathic, from, 1936, and, from, 1942, as, a, shortening, of, the, noun, psychopath, but, it, is, also, used, as, shorthand, for, psychotic, or, crazed, the, media, usually, uses, the, term, psychopath, to, designate, any, criminal, whose, offenses, are, particularly, abhorrent, and, unnatural, but, that, is, not, its, original, or, general, psychiatric, meaning, the, word, element, socio, has, been, commonly, used, in, compound, words, since, around, 1880, the, term, sociopathy, may, have, been, first, introduced, in, 1909, in, germany, by, biological, psychiatrist, karl, birnbaum, and, in, 1930, in, the, us, by, educational, psychologist, george, e, partridge, as, an, alternative, to, the, concept, of, psychopathy, it, was, used, to, indicate, that, the, defining, feature, is, violation, of, social, norms, or, antisocial, behavior, and, may, be, social, or, biological, in, origin, the, terms, sociopathy, and, psychopathy, were, once, used, interchangeably, in, relation, to, antisocial, personality, disorder, sociopathy, is, now, outdated, and, is, not, a, scientific, term, psychopathy, however, is, a, well, documented, and, well, defined, construct, in, the, scientific, literature, there, are, many, psychopathic, personality, traits, there, are, no, sociopathic, traits, furthermore, the, dsm, 5, introduced, the, dimensional, model, of, personality, disorders, in, section, iii, which, includes, a, specifier, for, diagnosing, psychopathy, according, to, the, dsm, primary, psychopathy, is, diagnosed, when, an, individual, meets, criteria, for, both, antisocial, personality, disorder, it, s, psychopathic, features, specifier, the, psychopathic, features, specifier, has, been, modeled, on, factor, 1, of, the, psychopathic, personality, inventory, known, as, fearless, dominance, this, explicates, psychopathy, as, not, being, a, more, extreme, version, of, aspd, but, as, an, emergent, compound, trait, that, manifests, when, antisocial, personality, disorder, is, present, in, combination, with, high, levels, of, fearless, dominance, or, boldness, as, it, s, known, in, the, triarchic, model, analyses, showed, that, this, section, iii, aspd, greatly, outperformed, section, ii, aspd, in, predicting, scores, on, hare, s, 2003, psychopathy, checklist, revised, section, iii, aspd, including, the, psychopathic, traits, specifier, can, be, seen, on, page, 765, of, the, dsm, 5, or, page, 885, of, the, dsm, 5, tr, the, term, is, used, in, various, ways, in, contemporary, usage, robert, hare, stated, in, the, popular, science, book, snakes, in, suits, that, sociopathy, and, psychopathy, are, often, used, interchangeably, but, in, some, cases, the, term, sociopathy, is, preferred, because, it, is, less, likely, than, is, psychopathy, to, be, confused, with, psychosis, whereas, in, other, cases, the, two, terms, may, be, used, with, different, meanings, that, reflect, the, user, s, views, on, its, origins, and, determinants, hare, contended, that, the, term, sociopathy, is, preferred, by, those, who, see, the, causes, as, due, to, social, factors, and, early, environment, and, the, term, psychopathy, is, preferred, by, those, who, believe, that, there, are, psychological, biological, and, genetic, factors, involved, in, addition, to, environmental, factors, hare, also, provides, his, own, definitions, he, describes, psychopathy, as, lacking, a, sense, of, empathy, or, morality, but, sociopathy, as, only, differing, from, the, average, person, in, the, sense, of, right, and, wrong, ancient, writings, that, have, been, connected, to, psychopathic, traits, include, deuteronomy, 21, 18, 21, and, a, description, of, an, unscrupulous, man, by, the, greek, philosopher, theophrastus, around, 300, bc, the, concept, of, psychopathy, has, been, indirectly, connected, to, the, early, 19th, century, work, of, pinel, 1801, mania, without, delirium, and, pritchard, 1835, moral, insanity, although, historians, have, largely, discredited, the, idea, of, a, direct, equivalence, psychopathy, originally, described, any, illness, of, the, mind, but, found, its, application, to, a, narrow, subset, of, mental, conditions, when, it, was, used, toward, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, by, the, german, psychiatrist, julius, koch, 1891, to, describe, various, behavioral, and, moral, dysfunction, in, the, absence, of, an, obvious, mental, illness, or, intellectual, disability, he, applied, the, term, psychopathic, inferiority, psychopathischen, minderwertigkeiten, to, various, chronic, conditions, and, character, disorders, and, his, work, would, influence, the, later, conception, of, the, personality, disorder, the, term, psychopathic, came, to, be, used, to, describe, a, diverse, range, of, dysfunctional, or, antisocial, behavior, and, mental, and, sexual, deviances, including, at, the, time, homosexuality, it, was, often, used, to, imply, an, underlying, constitutional, or, genetic, origin, disparate, early, descriptions, likely, set, the, stage, for, modern, controversies, about, the, definition, of, psychopathy, an, influential, figure, in, shaping, modern, american, conceptualizations, of, psychopathy, was, american, psychiatrist, hervey, cleckley, in, his, classic, monograph, the, mask, of, sanity, 1941, cleckley, drew, on, a, small, series, of, vivid, case, studies, of, psychiatric, patients, at, a, veterans, administration, hospital, in, georgia, to, provide, a, description, for, psychopathy, cleckley, used, the, metaphor, of, the, mask, to, refer, to, the, tendency, of, psychopaths, to, appear, confident, personable, and, well, adjusted, compared, to, most, psychiatric, patients, while, revealing, underlying, pathology, through, their, actions, over, time, cleckley, formulated, sixteen, criteria, for, psychopathy, the, scottish, psychiatrist, david, henderson, had, also, been, influential, in, europe, from, 1939, in, narrowing, the, diagnosis, the, diagnostic, category, of, sociopathic, personality, in, early, editions, of, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, dsm, had, some, key, similarities, to, cleckley, s, ideas, though, in, 1980, when, renamed, antisocial, personality, disorder, some, of, the, underlying, personality, assumptions, were, removed, in, 1980, canadian, psychologist, robert, d, hare, introduced, an, alternative, measure, the, psychopathy, checklist, pcl, based, largely, on, cleckley, s, criteria, which, was, revised, in, 1991, pcl, r, and, is, the, most, widely, used, measure, of, psychopathy, there, are, also, several, self, report, tests, with, the, psychopathic, personality, inventory, ppi, used, more, often, among, these, in, contemporary, adult, research, famous, individuals, have, sometimes, been, diagnosed, albeit, at, a, distance, as, psychopaths, as, one, example, out, of, many, possible, from, history, in, a, 1972, version, of, a, secret, report, originally, prepared, for, the, office, of, strategic, services, in, 1943, and, which, may, have, been, intended, to, be, used, as, propaganda, non, medical, psychoanalyst, walter, c, langer, suggested, adolf, hitler, was, probably, a, psychopath, however, others, have, not, drawn, this, conclusion, clinical, forensic, psychologist, glenn, walters, argues, that, hitler, s, actions, do, not, warrant, a, diagnosis, of, psychopathy, as, although, he, showed, several, characteristics, of, criminality, he, was, not, always, egocentric, callously, disregarding, of, feelings, or, lacking, impulse, control, and, there, is, no, proof, he, could, not, learn, from, mistakes, psychopaths, are, social, predators, who, charm, manipulate, and, ruthlessly, plow, their, way, through, life, leaving, a, broad, trail, of, broken, hearts, shattered, expectations, and, empty, wallets, completely, lacking, in, conscience, and, in, feelings, for, others, they, selfishly, take, what, they, want, and, do, as, they, please, violating, social, norms, and, expectations, without, the, slightest, sense, of, guilt, or, regret, robert, d, hare, 1993, p, xi, there, are, multiple, conceptualizations, of, psychopathy, including, cleckleyan, psychopathy, hervey, cleckley, s, conception, entailing, bold, disinhibited, behavior, and, feckless, disregard, and, criminal, psychopathy, a, meaner, more, aggressive, and, disinhibited, conception, explicitly, entailing, persistent, and, sometimes, serious, criminal, behavior, the, latter, conceptualization, is, typically, used, as, the, modern, clinical, concept, and, assessed, by, the, psychopathy, checklist, the, label, psychopath, may, have, implications, and, stigma, related, to, decisions, about, punishment, severity, for, criminal, acts, medical, treatment, civil, commitments, etc, efforts, have, therefore, been, made, to, clarify, the, meaning, of, the, term, it, has, been, suggested, that, those, who, share, the, same, emotional, deficiencies, and, psychopathic, features, but, are, properly, socialized, should, not, be, designated, as, psychopaths, the, triarchic, model, suggests, that, different, conceptions, of, psychopathy, emphasize, three, observable, characteristics, to, various, degrees, analyses, have, been, made, with, respect, to, the, applicability, of, measurement, tools, such, as, the, psychopathy, checklist, pcl, pcl, r, and, psychopathic, personality, inventory, ppi, to, this, model, psychopathy, has, been, conceptualized, as, a, hybrid, condition, marked, by, a, paradoxical, combination, of, superficial, charm, poise, emotional, resilience, and, venturesomeness, on, the, outside, but, deep, seated, affective, disturbances, and, impulse, control, deficits, on, the, inside, from, this, perspective, psychopathy, is, at, least, in, part, characterized, by, psychologically, adaptive, traits, furthermore, according, to, this, view, psychopathy, may, be, linked, to, at, least, some, interpersonally, successful, outcomes, such, as, effective, leadership, business, accomplishments, and, heroism, an, early, and, influential, analysis, from, harris, and, colleagues, indicated, that, a, discrete, category, or, taxon, may, underlie, pcl, r, psychopathy, allowing, it, to, be, measured, and, analyzed, however, this, was, only, found, for, the, behavioral, factor, 2, items, they, identified, child, problem, behaviors, adult, criminal, behavior, did, not, support, the, existence, of, a, taxon, marcus, john, and, edens, more, recently, performed, a, series, of, statistical, analyses, on, ppi, scores, and, concluded, that, psychopathy, may, best, be, conceptualized, as, having, a, dimensional, latent, structure, like, depression, marcus, et, al, repeated, the, study, on, a, larger, sample, of, prisoners, using, the, pcl, r, and, seeking, to, rule, out, other, experimental, or, statistical, issues, that, may, have, produced, the, previously, different, findings, they, again, found, that, the, psychopathy, measurements, do, not, appear, to, be, identifying, a, discrete, type, a, taxon, they, suggest, that, while, for, legal, or, other, practical, purposes, an, arbitrary, cut, off, point, on, trait, scores, might, be, used, there, is, actually, no, clear, scientific, evidence, for, an, objective, point, of, difference, by, which, to, label, some, people, psychopaths, in, other, words, a, psychopath, may, be, more, accurately, described, as, someone, who, is, relatively, psychopathic, the, pcl, r, was, developed, for, research, not, clinical, forensic, diagnosis, and, even, for, research, purposes, to, improve, understanding, of, the, underlying, issues, it, is, necessary, to, examine, dimensions, of, personality, in, general, rather, than, only, a, constellation, of, traits, studies, have, linked, psychopathy, to, alternative, dimensions, such, as, antagonism, high, conscientiousness, low, and, anxiousness, low, psychopathy, has, also, been, linked, to, high, psychoticism, a, theorized, dimension, referring, to, tough, aggressive, or, hostile, tendencies, aspects, of, this, that, appear, associated, with, psychopathy, are, lack, of, socialization, and, responsibility, impulsivity, sensation, seeking, in, some, cases, and, aggression, otto, kernberg, from, a, particular, psychoanalytic, perspective, believed, psychopathy, should, be, considered, as, part, of, a, spectrum, of, pathological, narcissism, that, would, range, from, narcissistic, personality, on, the, low, end, malignant, narcissism, in, the, middle, and, psychopathy, at, the, high, end, psychopathy, narcissism, and, machiavellianism, three, personality, traits, that, are, together, referred, to, as, the, dark, triad, share, certain, characteristics, such, as, a, callous, manipulative, interpersonal, style, the, dark, tetrad, refers, to, these, traits, with, the, addition, of, sadism, several, psychologists, have, asserted, that, subclinical, psychopathy, and, machiavellianism, are, more, or, less, interchangeable, there, is, a, subscale, on, the, psychopathic, personality, inventory, ppi, dubbed, machiavellian, egocentricity, delroy, paulhus, has, asserted, that, the, difference, that, most, miss, is, that, while, both, are, characterized, by, manipulativeness, and, unemotionality, psychopaths, tend, to, be, more, reckless, one, study, asserted, that, the, ability, to, adapt, reappraise, and, reassess, a, situation, may, be, key, factors, differentiating, machiavellianism, from, psychopathy, for, example, psychopathy, and, machiavellianism, were, also, correlated, similarly, in, responses, to, affective, stimuli, and, both, are, negatively, correlated, with, recognition, of, facial, emotions, many, have, suggested, merging, the, dark, triad, traits, especially, machiavellianism, and, psychopathy, into, one, construct, given, empirical, studies, which, show, immense, overlap, the, current, conceptions, of, psychopathy, have, been, criticized, for, being, poorly, conceptualized, highly, subjective, and, encompassing, a, wide, variety, of, underlying, disorders, dorothy, otnow, lewis, has, written, the, concept, and, subsequent, reification, of, the, diagnosis, psychopathy, has, to, this, author, s, mind, hampered, the, understanding, of, criminality, and, violence, according, to, hare, in, many, cases, one, need, not, even, meet, the, patient, just, rummage, through, his, records, to, determine, what, items, seemed, to, fit, nonsense, to, this, writer, s, mind, psychopathy, and, its, synonyms, e, g, sociopathy, and, antisocial, personality, are, lazy, diagnoses, over, the, years, the, authors, team, has, seen, scores, of, offenders, who, prior, to, evaluation, by, the, authors, were, dismissed, as, psychopaths, or, the, like, detailed, comprehensive, psychiatric, neurological, and, neuropsychological, evaluations, have, uncovered, a, multitude, of, signs, symptoms, and, behaviors, indicative, of, such, disorders, as, bipolar, mood, disorder, schizophrenia, spectrum, disorders, complex, partial, seizures, dissociative, identity, disorder, parasomnia, and, of, course, brain, damage, dysfunction, half, of, the, hare, psychopathy, checklist, consists, of, symptoms, of, mania, hypomania, and, frontal, lobe, dysfunction, which, frequently, results, in, underlying, disorders, being, dismissed, hare, s, conception, of, psychopathy, has, also, been, criticized, for, being, reductionist, dismissive, tautological, and, ignorant, of, context, as, well, as, the, dynamic, nature, of, human, behavior, some, have, called, for, rejection, of, the, concept, altogether, due, to, its, vague, subjective, and, judgmental, nature, that, makes, it, prone, to, misuse, a, systematic, review, determined, that, the, pcl, is, weakly, predictive, of, criminal, behavior, but, not, of, lack, of, conscience, or, treatment, and, rehabilitation, outcomes, these, findings, contradict, widespread, beliefs, amongst, professionals, in, forensics, psychopathic, individuals, do, not, show, regret, or, remorse, this, was, thought, to, be, due, to, an, inability, to, generate, this, emotion, in, response, to, negative, outcomes, however, in, 2016, people, with, antisocial, personality, disorder, and, dissocial, personality, disorder, were, found, to, experience, regret, but, did, not, use, the, regret, to, guide, their, choice, in, behavior, there, was, no, lack, of, regret, but, a, problem, to, think, through, a, range, of, potential, actions, and, estimating, the, outcome, values, in, an, experiment, published, in, march, 2007, at, the, university, of, southern, california, neuroscientist, antonio, r, damasio, and, his, colleagues, showed, that, subjects, with, damage, to, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, lack, the, ability, to, empathically, feel, their, way, to, moral, answers, and, that, when, confronted, with, moral, dilemmas, these, brain, damaged, patients, coldly, came, up, with, end, justifies, the, means, answers, leading, damasio, to, conclude, that, the, point, was, not, that, they, reached, immoral, conclusions, but, that, when, they, were, confronted, by, a, difficult, issue, in, this, case, as, whether, to, shoot, down, a, passenger, plane, hijacked, by, terrorists, before, it, hits, a, major, city, these, patients, appear, to, reach, decisions, without, the, anguish, that, afflicts, those, with, typically, functioning, brains, according, to, adrian, raine, a, clinical, neuroscientist, also, at, the, university, of, southern, california, one, of, this, study, s, implications, is, that, society, may, have, to, rethink, how, it, judges, immoral, people, psychopaths, often, feel, no, empathy, or, remorse, without, that, awareness, people, relying, exclusively, on, reasoning, seem, to, find, it, harder, to, sort, their, way, through, moral, thickets, does, that, mean, they, should, be, held, to, different, standards, of, accountability, socially, psychopathy, typically, involves, extensive, callous, and, manipulative, self, serving, behaviors, with, no, regard, for, others, and, often, is, associated, with, repeated, delinquency, crime, and, violence, mentally, impairments, in, processes, related, to, affect, and, cognition, particularly, socially, related, mental, processes, have, also, been, found, developmentally, symptoms, of, psychopathy, have, been, identified, in, young, children, with, conduct, disorder, and, suggests, at, least, a, partial, constitutional, factor, that, influences, its, development, disagreement, exists, over, which, features, should, be, considered, as, part, of, psychopathy, with, researchers, identifying, around, 40, traits, supposedly, indicative, of, the, construct, though, the, following, characteristics, are, almost, universally, considered, central, cooke, and, michie, 2001, proposed, a, three, factor, model, of, the, psychopathy, checklist, revised, which, has, seen, widespread, application, in, other, measures, e, g, youth, psychopathic, traits, inventory, antisocial, process, screening, device, cleckley, s, 1941, original, description, of, psychopathy, included, the, absence, of, nervousness, and, neurotic, disorders, and, later, theorists, referred, to, psychopaths, as, fearless, or, thick, skinned, while, it, is, often, claimed, that, the, pcl, r, does, not, include, low, anxiety, or, fearlessness, such, features, do, contribute, to, the, scoring, of, the, facet, 1, interpersonal, items, mainly, through, self, assurance, unrealistic, optimism, brazenness, and, imperturbability, indeed, while, self, report, studies, have, been, inconsistent, using, the, two, factor, model, of, the, pcl, r, studies, which, separate, factor, 1, into, interpersonal, and, affective, facets, more, regularly, show, modest, associations, between, facet, 1, and, low, anxiety, boldness, and, fearless, dominance, especially, items, assessing, glibness, charm, and, grandiosity, when, both, psychopathy, and, low, anxiety, boldness, are, measured, using, interviews, both, interpersonal, and, affective, facets, are, both, associated, with, fearlessness, and, lack, of, internalizing, disorders, the, importance, of, low, anxiety, fearlessness, to, psychopathy, has, historically, been, underscored, through, behavioral, and, physiological, studies, showing, diminished, responses, to, threatening, stimuli, interpersonal, and, affective, facets, both, contributing, however, it, is, not, known, whether, this, is, reflected, in, reduced, experience, of, state, fear, or, where, it, reflects, impaired, detection, and, response, to, threat, related, stimuli, moreover, such, deficits, in, threat, responding, are, known, to, be, reduced, or, even, abolished, when, attention, is, focused, on, the, threatening, stimuli, in, terms, of, simple, correlations, the, pcl, r, manual, states, an, average, score, of, 22, 1, has, been, found, in, north, american, prisoner, samples, and, that, 20, 5, scored, 30, or, higher, an, analysis, of, prisoner, samples, from, outside, north, america, found, a, somewhat, lower, average, value, of, 17, 5, studies, have, found, that, psychopathy, scores, correlated, with, repeated, imprisonment, detention, in, higher, security, disciplinary, infractions, and, substance, misuse, psychopathy, as, measured, with, the, pcl, r, in, institutional, settings, shows, in, meta, analyses, small, to, moderate, effect, sizes, with, institutional, misbehavior, postrelease, crime, or, postrelease, violent, crime, with, similar, effects, for, the, three, outcomes, individual, studies, give, similar, results, for, adult, offenders, forensic, psychiatric, samples, community, samples, and, youth, the, pcl, r, is, poorer, at, predicting, sexual, re, offending, this, small, to, moderate, effect, appears, to, be, due, largely, to, the, scale, items, that, assess, impulsive, behaviors, and, past, criminal, history, which, are, well, established, but, very, general, risk, factors, the, aspects, of, core, personality, often, held, to, be, distinctively, psychopathic, generally, show, little, or, no, predictive, link, to, crime, by, themselves, for, example, factor, 1, of, the, pcl, r, and, fearless, dominance, of, the, ppi, r, have, smaller, or, no, relationship, to, crime, including, violent, crime, in, contrast, factor, 2, and, impulsive, antisociality, of, the, ppi, r, are, associated, more, strongly, with, criminality, factor, 2, has, a, relationship, of, similar, strength, to, that, of, the, pcl, r, as, a, whole, the, antisocial, facet, of, the, pcl, r, is, still, predictive, of, future, violence, after, controlling, for, past, criminal, behavior, which, together, with, results, regarding, the, ppi, r, which, by, design, does, not, include, past, criminal, behavior, suggests, that, impulsive, behaviors, is, an, independent, risk, factor, thus, the, concept, of, psychopathy, may, perform, poorly, when, attempted, to, be, used, as, a, general, theory, of, crime, studies, have, suggested, a, strong, correlation, between, psychopathy, scores, and, violence, and, the, pcl, r, emphasizes, features, that, are, somewhat, predictive, of, violent, behavior, researchers, however, have, noted, that, psychopathy, is, dissociable, from, and, not, synonymous, with, violence, it, has, been, suggested, that, psychopathy, is, associated, with, instrumental, aggression, also, known, as, predatory, proactive, or, cold, blooded, aggression, a, form, of, aggression, characterized, by, reduced, emotion, and, conducted, with, a, goal, differing, from, but, facilitated, by, the, commission, of, harm, one, conclusion, in, this, regard, was, made, by, a, 2002, study, of, homicide, offenders, which, reported, that, the, homicides, committed, by, homicidal, offenders, with, psychopathy, were, almost, always, 93, 3, primarily, instrumental, significantly, more, than, the, proportion, 48, 4, of, those, committed, by, non, psychopathic, homicidal, offenders, with, the, instrumentality, of, the, homicide, also, correlated, with, the, total, pcl, r, score, of, the, offender, as, well, as, their, scores, on, the, factor, 1, interpersonal, affective, dimension, however, contrary, to, the, equating, of, this, to, mean, exclusively, in, cold, blood, more, than, a, third, of, the, homicides, committed, by, psychopathic, offenders, involved, some, component, of, emotional, reactivity, as, well, in, any, case, fbi, profilers, indicate, that, serious, victim, injury, is, generally, an, emotional, offense, and, some, research, supports, this, at, least, with, regard, to, sexual, offending, one, study, has, found, more, serious, offending, by, non, psychopathic, offenders, on, average, than, by, offenders, with, psychopathy, e, g, more, homicides, versus, more, armed, robbery, and, property, offenses, and, another, that, the, affective, facet, of, the, pcl, r, predicted, reduced, offense, seriousness, studies, on, perpetrators, of, domestic, violence, find, that, abusers, have, high, rates, of, psychopathy, with, the, prevalence, estimated, to, be, at, around, 15, 30, furthermore, the, commission, of, domestic, violence, is, correlated, with, factor, 1, of, the, pcl, r, which, describes, the, emotional, deficits, and, the, callous, and, exploitative, interpersonal, style, found, in, psychopathy, the, prevalence, of, psychopathy, among, domestic, abusers, indicate, that, the, core, characteristics, of, psychopathy, such, as, callousness, remorselessness, and, a, lack, of, close, interpersonal, bonds, predispose, those, with, psychopathy, to, committing, domestic, abuse, and, suggest, that, the, domestic, abuses, committed, by, these, individuals, are, callously, perpetrated, i, e, instrumentally, aggressive, rather, than, a, case, of, emotional, aggression, and, therefore, may, not, be, amenable, to, the, types, of, psychosocial, interventions, commonly, given, to, domestic, abuse, perpetrators, some, clinicians, suggest, that, assessment, of, the, construct, of, psychopathy, does, not, necessarily, add, value, to, violence, risk, assessment, a, large, systematic, review, and, meta, regression, found, that, the, pcl, performed, the, poorest, out, of, nine, tools, for, predicting, violence, in, addition, studies, conducted, by, the, authors, or, translators, of, violence, prediction, measures, including, the, pcl, show, on, average, more, positive, results, than, those, conducted, by, more, independent, investigators, there, are, several, other, risk, assessment, instruments, which, can, predict, further, crime, with, an, accuracy, similar, to, the, pcl, r, and, some, of, these, are, considerably, easier, quicker, and, less, expensive, to, administer, this, may, even, be, done, automatically, by, a, computer, simply, based, on, data, such, as, age, gender, number, of, previous, convictions, and, age, of, first, conviction, some, of, these, assessments, may, also, identify, treatment, change, and, goals, identify, quick, changes, that, may, help, short, term, management, identify, more, specific, kinds, of, violence, that, may, be, at, risk, and, may, have, established, specific, probabilities, of, offending, for, specific, scores, nonetheless, the, pcl, r, may, continue, to, be, popular, for, risk, assessment, because, of, its, pioneering, role, and, the, large, amount, of, research, done, using, it, the, federal, bureau, of, investigation, reports, that, psychopathic, behavior, is, consistent, with, traits, common, to, some, serial, killers, including, sensation, seeking, a, lack, of, remorse, or, guilt, impulsivity, the, need, for, control, and, predatory, behavior, it, has, also, been, found, that, the, homicide, victims, of, psychopathic, offenders, were, disproportionately, female, in, comparison, to, the, more, equitable, gender, distribution, of, victims, of, non, psychopathic, offenders, psychopathy, has, been, associated, with, commission, of, sexual, crime, with, some, researchers, arguing, that, it, is, correlated, with, a, preference, for, violent, sexual, behavior, a, 2011, study, of, conditional, releases, for, canadian, male, federal, offenders, found, that, psychopathy, was, related, to, more, violent, and, non, violent, offences, but, not, more, sexual, offences, for, child, molesters, psychopathy, was, associated, with, more, offences, a, study, on, the, relationship, between, psychopathy, scores, and, types, of, aggression, in, a, sample, of, sexual, murderers, in, which, 84, 2, of, the, sample, had, pcl, r, scores, above, 20, and, 47, 4, above, 30, found, that, 82, 4, of, those, with, scores, above, 30, had, engaged, in, sadistic, violence, defined, as, enjoyment, indicated, by, self, report, or, evidence, compared, to, 52, 6, of, those, with, scores, below, 30, and, total, pcl, r, and, factor, 1, scores, correlated, significantly, with, sadistic, violence, despite, this, it, is, reported, that, offenders, with, psychopathy, both, sexual, and, non, sexual, offenders, are, about, 2, 5, times, more, likely, to, be, granted, conditional, release, compared, to, non, psychopathic, offenders, hildebrand, and, colleagues, 2004, have, uncovered, an, interaction, between, psychopathy, and, deviant, sexual, interests, wherein, those, high, in, psychopathy, who, also, endorsed, deviant, sexual, interests, were, more, likely, to, recidivate, sexually, a, subsequent, meta, analysis, has, consolidated, such, a, result, in, considering, the, issue, of, possible, reunification, of, some, sex, offenders, into, homes, with, a, non, offending, parent, and, children, it, has, been, advised, that, any, sex, offender, with, a, significant, criminal, history, should, be, assessed, on, the, pcl, r, and, if, they, score, 18, or, higher, then, they, should, be, excluded, from, any, consideration, of, being, placed, in, a, home, with, children, under, any, circumstances, there, is, however, increasing, concern, that, pcl, scores, are, too, inconsistent, between, different, examiners, including, in, its, use, to, evaluate, sex, offenders, the, possibility, of, psychopathy, has, been, associated, with, organized, crime, economic, crime, and, war, crimes, terrorists, are, sometimes, considered, psychopathic, and, comparisons, may, be, drawn, with, traits, such, as, antisocial, violence, a, selfish, world, view, that, precludes, the, welfare, of, others, a, lack, of, remorse, or, guilt, and, blame, externalization, however, john, horgan, author, of, the, psychology, of, terrorism, argues, that, such, comparisons, could, also, then, be, drawn, more, widely, for, example, to, soldiers, in, wars, coordinated, terrorist, activity, requires, organization, loyalty, and, ideological, fanaticism, often, to, the, extreme, of, sacrificing, oneself, for, an, ideological, cause, traits, such, as, a, self, centered, disposition, unreliability, poor, behavioral, controls, and, unusual, behaviors, may, disadvantage, or, preclude, psychopathic, individuals, in, conducting, organized, terrorism, it, may, be, that, a, significant, portion, of, people, with, psychopathy, are, socially, successful, and, tend, to, express, their, antisocial, behavior, through, more, covert, avenues, such, as, social, manipulation, or, white, collar, crime, such, individuals, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, successful, psychopaths, and, may, not, necessarily, always, have, extensive, histories, of, traditional, antisocial, behavior, as, characteristic, of, traditional, psychopathy, the, pcl, yv, is, an, adaptation, of, the, pcl, r, for, individuals, aged, 13, 18, years, it, is, like, the, pcl, r, done, by, a, trained, rater, based, on, an, interview, and, an, examination, of, criminal, and, other, records, the, antisocial, process, screening, device, apsd, is, also, an, adaptation, of, the, pcl, r, it, can, be, administered, by, parents, or, teachers, for, individuals, aged, 6, 13, years, high, psychopathy, scores, for, both, juveniles, as, measured, with, these, instruments, and, adults, as, measured, with, the, pcl, r, and, other, measurement, tools, have, similar, associations, with, other, variables, including, similar, ability, in, predicting, violence, and, criminality, juvenile, psychopathy, may, also, be, associated, with, more, negative, emotionality, such, as, anger, hostility, anxiety, and, depression, psychopathic, traits, in, youth, typically, comprise, three, factors, callous, unemotional, narcissism, and, impulsivity, irresponsibility, there, is, positive, correlation, between, early, negative, life, events, of, the, ages, 0, 4, and, the, emotion, based, aspects, of, psychopathy, there, are, moderate, to, high, correlations, between, psychopathy, rankings, from, late, childhood, to, early, adolescence, the, correlations, are, considerably, lower, from, early, or, mid, adolescence, to, adulthood, in, one, study, most, of, the, similarities, were, on, the, impulsive, and, antisocial, behavior, scales, of, those, adolescents, who, scored, in, the, top, 5, highest, psychopathy, scores, at, age, 13, less, than, one, third, 29, were, classified, as, psychopathic, at, age, 24, some, recent, studies, have, also, found, poorer, ability, at, predicting, long, term, adult, offending, conduct, disorder, is, diagnosed, based, on, a, prolonged, pattern, of, antisocial, behavior, in, childhood, and, or, adolescence, and, may, be, seen, as, a, precursor, to, aspd, some, researchers, have, speculated, that, there, are, two, subtypes, of, conduct, disorder, which, mark, dual, developmental, pathways, to, adult, psychopathy, the, dsm, allows, differentiating, between, childhood, onset, before, age, 10, and, adolescent, onset, at, age, 10, and, later, childhood, onset, is, argued, to, be, more, due, to, a, personality, disorder, caused, by, neurological, deficits, interacting, with, an, adverse, environment, for, many, but, not, all, childhood, onset, is, associated, with, what, is, in, terrie, moffitt, s, developmental, theory, of, crime, referred, to, as, life, course, persistent, antisocial, behavior, as, well, as, poorer, health, and, economic, status, adolescent, onset, is, argued, to, more, typically, be, associated, with, short, term, antisocial, behavior, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, combination, of, early, onset, conduct, disorder, and, adhd, may, be, associated, with, life, course, persistent, antisocial, behaviors, as, well, as, psychopathy, there, is, evidence, that, this, combination, is, more, aggressive, and, antisocial, than, those, with, conduct, disorder, alone, however, it, is, not, a, particularly, distinct, group, since, the, vast, majority, of, young, children, with, conduct, disorder, also, have, adhd, some, evidence, indicates, that, this, group, has, deficits, in, behavioral, inhibition, similar, to, that, of, adults, with, psychopathy, they, may, not, be, more, likely, than, those, with, conduct, disorder, alone, to, have, the, interpersonal, affective, features, and, the, deficits, in, emotional, processing, characteristic, of, adults, with, psychopathy, proponents, of, different, types, dimensions, of, psychopathy, have, seen, this, type, as, possibly, corresponding, to, adult, secondary, psychopathy, and, increased, disinhibition, in, the, triarchic, model, the, dsm, 5, includes, a, specifier, for, those, with, conduct, disorder, who, also, display, a, callous, unemotional, interpersonal, style, across, multiple, settings, and, relationships, the, specifier, is, based, on, research, which, suggests, that, those, with, conduct, disorder, who, also, meet, criteria, for, the, specifier, tend, to, have, a, more, severe, form, of, the, disorder, with, an, earlier, onset, as, well, as, a, different, response, to, treatment, proponents, of, different, types, dimensions, of, psychopathy, have, seen, this, as, possibly, corresponding, to, adult, primary, psychopathy, and, increased, boldness, and, or, meanness, in, the, triarchic, model, dysfunctions, in, the, prefrontal, cortex, and, amygdala, regions, of, the, brain, have, been, associated, with, specific, learning, impairments, in, psychopathy, damage, to, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, which, regulates, the, activity, in, the, amygdala, leads, to, common, characteristics, in, psychopathic, individuals, since, the, 1980s, scientists, have, linked, traumatic, brain, injury, including, damage, to, these, regions, with, violent, and, psychopathic, behavior, patients, with, damage, in, such, areas, resembled, psychopathic, individuals, whose, brains, were, incapable, of, acquiring, social, and, moral, knowledge, those, who, acquired, damage, as, children, may, have, trouble, conceptualizing, social, or, moral, reasoning, while, those, with, adult, acquired, damage, may, be, aware, of, proper, social, and, moral, conduct, but, be, unable, to, behave, appropriately, dysfunctions, in, the, amygdala, and, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, may, also, impair, stimulus, reinforced, learning, in, psychopaths, whether, punishment, based, or, reward, based, people, scoring, 25, or, higher, in, the, pcl, r, with, an, associated, history, of, violent, behavior, appear, to, have, significantly, reduced, mean, microstructural, integrity, in, their, uncinate, fasciculus, white, matter, connecting, the, amygdala, and, orbitofrontal, cortex, there, is, evidence, from, dt, mri, of, breakdowns, in, the, white, matter, connections, between, these, two, important, areas, although, some, studies, have, suggested, inverse, relationships, between, psychopathy, and, intelligence, including, with, regards, to, verbal, iq, hare, and, neumann, state, that, a, large, literature, demonstrates, at, most, only, a, weak, association, between, psychopathy, and, iq, noting, that, the, early, pioneer, cleckley, included, good, intelligence, in, his, checklist, due, to, selection, bias, since, many, of, his, patients, were, well, educated, and, from, middle, class, or, upper, class, backgrounds, and, that, there, is, no, obvious, theoretical, reason, why, the, disorder, described, by, cleckley, or, other, clinicians, should, be, related, to, intelligence, some, psychopaths, are, bright, others, less, so, studies, also, indicate, that, different, aspects, of, the, definition, of, psychopathy, e, g, interpersonal, affective, emotion, behavioral, and, lifestyle, components, can, show, different, links, to, intelligence, and, the, result, can, depend, on, the, type, of, intelligence, assessment, e, g, verbal, creative, practical, analytical, a, large, body, of, research, suggests, that, psychopathy, is, associated, with, atypical, responses, to, distress, cues, from, other, people, more, precisely, an, impaired, emotional, empathy, in, the, recognition, of, and, response, to, facial, expressions, body, gestures, and, vocal, tones, of, fear, sadness, pain, and, happiness, this, impaired, recognition, and, reduced, autonomic, responsiveness, might, be, partly, accounted, for, by, a, decreased, activation, of, the, fusiform, and, extrastriate, cortical, regions, the, underlying, biological, surfaces, for, processing, expressions, of, happiness, are, functionally, intact, in, psychopaths, although, less, responsive, than, those, of, controls, the, neuroimaging, literature, is, unclear, as, to, whether, deficits, are, specific, to, particular, emotions, such, as, fear, the, overall, pattern, of, results, across, studies, indicates, that, people, diagnosed, with, psychopathy, demonstrate, reduced, mri, fmri, amri, pet, and, spect, activity, in, areas, of, the, brain, research, has, also, shown, that, an, approximate, 18, smaller, amygdala, size, contributes, to, a, significantly, lower, emotional, sensation, in, regards, to, fear, sadness, amongst, other, negative, emotions, which, may, likely, be, the, reason, as, to, why, psychopathic, individuals, have, lower, empathy, some, recent, fmri, studies, have, reported, that, emotion, perception, deficits, in, psychopathy, are, pervasive, across, emotions, positives, and, negatives, studies, on, children, with, psychopathic, tendencies, have, also, shown, such, associations, meta, analyses, have, also, found, evidence, of, impairments, in, both, vocal, and, facial, emotional, recognition, for, several, emotions, i, e, not, only, fear, and, sadness, in, both, adults, and, children, adolescents, psychopathy, has, been, associated, with, amorality, an, absence, of, indifference, towards, or, disregard, for, moral, beliefs, there, are, few, firm, data, on, patterns, of, moral, judgment, studies, of, developmental, level, sophistication, of, moral, reasoning, found, all, possible, results, lower, higher, or, the, same, as, non, psychopaths, studies, that, compared, judgments, of, personal, moral, transgressions, versus, judgments, of, breaking, conventional, rules, or, laws, found, that, psychopaths, rated, them, as, equally, severe, whereas, non, psychopaths, rated, the, rule, breaking, as, less, severe, a, study, comparing, judgments, of, whether, personal, or, impersonal, harm, would, be, endorsed, in, order, to, achieve, the, rationally, maximum, utilitarian, amount, of, welfare, found, no, significant, differences, between, subjects, high, and, low, in, psychopathy, however, a, further, study, using, the, same, tests, found, that, prisoners, scoring, high, on, the, pcl, were, more, likely, to, endorse, impersonal, harm, or, rule, violations, than, non, psychopathic, controls, were, the, psychopathic, offenders, who, scored, low, in, anxiety, were, also, more, willing, to, endorse, personal, harm, on, average, assessing, accidents, where, one, person, harmed, another, unintentionally, psychopaths, judged, such, actions, to, be, more, morally, permissible, this, result, has, been, considered, a, reflection, of, psychopaths, failure, to, appreciate, the, emotional, aspect, of, the, victim, s, harmful, experience, behavioral, genetic, studies, have, identified, potential, genetic, and, non, genetic, contributors, to, psychopathy, including, influences, on, brain, function, proponents, of, the, triarchic, model, believe, that, psychopathy, results, from, the, interaction, of, genetic, predispositions, and, an, adverse, environment, what, is, adverse, may, differ, depending, on, the, underlying, predisposition, for, example, it, is, hypothesized, that, persons, having, high, boldness, may, respond, poorly, to, punishment, but, may, respond, better, to, rewards, and, secure, attachments, genetically, informed, studies, of, the, personality, characteristics, typical, of, individuals, with, psychopathy, have, found, moderate, genetic, as, well, as, non, genetic, influences, on, the, ppi, fearless, dominance, and, impulsive, antisociality, were, similarly, influenced, by, genetic, factors, and, uncorrelated, with, each, other, genetic, factors, may, generally, influence, the, development, of, psychopathy, while, environmental, factors, affect, the, specific, expression, of, the, traits, that, predominate, a, study, on, a, large, group, of, children, found, more, than, 60, heritability, for, callous, unemotional, traits, and, that, conduct, disorder, among, children, with, these, traits, has, a, higher, heritability, than, among, children, without, these, traits, a, study, by, farrington, of, a, sample, of, london, males, followed, between, age, 8, and, 48, included, studying, which, factors, scored, 10, or, more, on, the, pcl, sv, at, age, 48, the, strongest, factors, included, having, a, convicted, parent, being, physically, neglected, low, involvement, of, the, father, with, the, boy, low, family, income, and, coming, from, a, disrupted, family, other, significant, factors, included, poor, supervision, abuse, harsh, discipline, large, family, size, delinquent, sibling, young, mother, depressed, mother, low, social, class, and, poor, housing, there, has, also, been, association, between, psychopathy, and, detrimental, treatment, by, peers, however, it, is, difficult, to, determine, the, extent, of, an, environmental, influence, on, the, development, of, psychopathy, because, of, evidence, of, its, strong, heritability, researchers, have, linked, head, injuries, with, psychopathy, and, violence, since, the, 1980s, scientists, have, associated, traumatic, brain, injury, such, as, damage, to, the, prefrontal, cortex, including, the, orbitofrontal, cortex, with, psychopathic, behavior, and, a, deficient, ability, to, make, morally, and, socially, acceptable, decisions, a, condition, that, has, been, termed, acquired, sociopathy, or, pseudopsychopathy, individuals, with, damage, to, the, area, of, the, prefrontal, cortex, known, as, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, show, remarkable, similarities, to, diagnosed, psychopathic, individuals, displaying, reduced, autonomic, response, to, emotional, stimuli, deficits, in, aversive, conditioning, similar, preferences, in, moral, and, economic, decision, making, and, diminished, empathy, and, social, emotions, like, guilt, or, shame, these, emotional, and, moral, impairments, may, be, especially, severe, when, the, brain, injury, occurs, at, a, young, age, children, with, early, damage, in, the, prefrontal, cortex, may, never, fully, develop, social, or, moral, reasoning, and, become, psychopathic, individuals, characterized, by, high, levels, of, aggression, and, antisocial, behavior, performed, without, guilt, or, empathy, for, their, victims, additionally, damage, to, the, amygdala, may, impair, the, ability, of, the, prefrontal, cortex, to, interpret, feedback, from, the, limbic, system, which, could, result, in, uninhibited, signals, that, manifest, in, violent, and, aggressive, behavior, the, influence, of, childhood, trauma, on, the, development, of, psychopathy, in, adulthood, remains, an, active, research, question, according, to, hervey, m, cleckley, a, psychopathic, person, is, someone, who, is, able, to, imitate, a, normal, functioning, person, while, masking, or, concealing, their, lack, of, internal, personality, structure, this, results, in, an, internal, disorder, with, recurrent, deliberate, and, detrimental, conduct, despite, presenting, themselves, as, serious, bright, and, charming, psychopathic, people, are, unable, to, experience, true, emotions, robert, hare, s, two, factor, model, and, christopher, patrick, s, triarchic, model, have, both, been, developed, to, better, understand, psychopathy, however, whether, the, root, cause, is, primarily, environmental, or, primarily, genetic, is, still, in, question, psychopathy, is, associated, with, several, adverse, life, outcomes, as, well, as, increased, risk, of, disability, and, death, due, to, factors, such, as, violence, accidents, homicides, and, suicides, this, in, combination, with, the, evidence, for, genetic, influences, is, evolutionarily, puzzling, and, may, suggest, that, there, are, compensating, evolutionary, advantages, and, researchers, within, evolutionary, psychology, have, proposed, several, evolutionary, explanations, according, to, one, hypothesis, some, traits, associated, with, psychopathy, may, be, socially, adaptive, and, psychopathy, may, be, a, frequency, dependent, socially, parasitic, strategy, which, may, work, as, long, as, there, is, a, large, population, of, altruistic, and, trusting, individuals, relative, to, the, population, of, psychopathic, individuals, to, be, exploited, it, is, also, suggested, that, some, traits, associated, with, psychopathy, such, as, early, promiscuous, adulterous, and, coercive, sexuality, may, increase, reproductive, success, robert, hare, has, stated, that, many, psychopathic, males, have, a, pattern, of, mating, with, and, quickly, abandoning, women, and, thereby, have, a, high, fertility, rate, resulting, in, children, that, may, inherit, a, predisposition, to, psychopathy, criticism, includes, that, it, may, be, better, to, look, at, the, contributing, personality, factors, rather, than, treat, psychopathy, as, a, unitary, concept, due, to, poor, testability, furthermore, if, psychopathy, is, caused, by, the, combined, effects, of, a, very, large, number, of, adverse, mutations, then, each, mutation, may, have, such, a, small, effect, that, it, escapes, natural, selection, the, personality, is, thought, to, be, influenced, by, a, very, large, number, of, genes, and, may, be, disrupted, by, random, mutations, and, psychopathy, may, instead, be, a, product, of, a, high, mutation, load, psychopathy, has, alternatively, been, suggested, to, be, a, spandrel, a, byproduct, or, side, effect, of, the, evolution, of, adaptive, traits, rather, than, an, adaptation, in, itself, some, laboratory, research, demonstrates, correlations, between, psychopathy, and, atypical, responses, to, aversive, stimuli, including, weak, conditioning, to, painful, stimuli, and, poor, learning, of, avoiding, responses, that, cause, punishment, as, well, as, low, reactivity, in, the, autonomic, nervous, system, as, measured, with, skin, conductance, while, waiting, for, a, painful, stimulus, but, not, when, the, stimulus, occurs, while, it, has, been, argued, that, the, reward, system, functions, normally, some, studies, have, also, found, reduced, reactivity, to, pleasurable, stimuli, according, to, the, response, modulation, hypothesis, psychopathic, individuals, have, also, had, difficulty, switching, from, an, ongoing, action, despite, environmental, cues, signaling, a, need, to, do, so, this, may, explain, the, difficulty, responding, to, punishment, although, it, is, unclear, if, it, can, explain, findings, such, as, deficient, conditioning, there, may, be, methodological, issues, regarding, the, research, while, establishing, a, range, of, idiosyncrasies, on, average, in, linguistic, and, affective, processing, under, certain, conditions, this, research, program, has, not, confirmed, a, common, pathology, of, psychopathy, thanks, to, advancing, mri, studies, experts, are, able, to, visualize, specific, brain, differences, and, abnormalities, of, individuals, with, psychopathy, in, areas, that, control, emotions, social, interactions, ethics, morality, regret, impulsivity, and, conscience, within, the, brain, blair, a, researcher, who, pioneered, research, into, psychopathic, tendencies, stated, with, regard, to, psychopathy, we, have, clear, indications, regarding, why, the, pathology, gives, rise, to, the, emotional, and, behavioral, disturbance, and, important, insights, into, the, neural, systems, implicated, in, this, pathology, dadds, et, al, remarks, that, despite, a, rapidly, advancing, neuroscience, of, empathy, little, is, known, about, the, developmental, underpinnings, of, the, psychopathic, disconnect, between, affective, and, cognitive, empathy, a, 2008, review, by, weber, et, al, suggested, that, psychopathy, is, sometimes, associated, with, brain, abnormalities, in, prefrontal, temporo, limbic, regions, that, are, involved, in, emotional, and, learning, processes, among, others, neuroimaging, studies, have, found, structural, and, functional, differences, between, those, scoring, high, and, low, on, the, pcl, r, in, a, 2011, review, by, skeem, et, al, stating, that, they, are, most, notably, in, the, amygdala, hippocampus, and, parahippocampal, gyri, anterior, and, posterior, cingulate, cortex, striatum, insula, and, frontal, and, temporal, cortex, the, amygdala, and, frontal, areas, have, been, suggested, as, particularly, important, people, scoring, 25, or, higher, in, the, pcl, r, with, an, associated, history, of, violent, behavior, appear, on, average, to, have, significantly, reduced, microstructural, integrity, between, the, white, matter, connecting, the, amygdala, and, orbitofrontal, cortex, such, as, the, uncinate, fasciculus, the, evidence, suggested, that, the, degree, of, abnormality, was, significantly, related, to, the, degree, of, psychopathy, and, may, explain, the, offending, behaviors, furthermore, changes, in, the, amygdala, have, been, associated, with, callous, unemotional, traits, in, children, however, the, amygdala, has, also, been, associated, with, positive, emotions, and, there, have, been, inconsistent, results, in, the, studies, in, particular, areas, which, may, be, due, to, methodological, issues, others, have, cast, doubt, on, the, amygdala, as, important, for, psychopathy, with, one, meta, analysis, suggesting, that, most, studies, on, the, amygdala, and, psychopathy, find, no, effect, and, that, studies, finding, a, negative, effect, that, psychopaths, display, less, amygdala, activity, have, lower, statistical, power, some, of, these, findings, are, consistent, with, other, research, and, theories, for, example, in, a, neuroimaging, study, of, how, individuals, with, psychopathy, respond, to, emotional, words, widespread, differences, in, activation, patterns, have, been, shown, across, the, temporal, lobe, when, psychopathic, criminals, were, compared, to, normal, volunteers, which, is, consistent, with, views, in, clinical, psychology, additionally, the, notion, of, psychopathy, being, characterized, by, low, fear, is, consistent, with, findings, of, abnormalities, in, the, amygdala, since, deficits, in, aversive, conditioning, and, instrumental, learning, are, thought, to, result, from, amygdala, dysfunction, potentially, compounded, by, orbitofrontal, cortex, dysfunction, although, the, specific, reasons, are, unknown, considerable, research, has, documented, the, presence, of, the, two, subtypes, of, primary, and, secondary, psychopathy, proponents, of, the, primary, secondary, psychopathy, distinction, and, triarchic, model, argue, that, there, are, neurological, differences, between, these, subgroups, of, psychopathy, which, support, their, views, for, instance, the, boldness, factor, in, the, triarchic, model, is, argued, to, be, associated, with, reduced, activity, in, the, amygdala, during, fearful, or, aversive, stimuli, and, reduced, startle, response, while, the, disinhibition, factor, is, argued, to, be, associated, with, impairment, of, frontal, lobe, tasks, there, is, evidence, that, boldness, and, disinhibition, are, genetically, distinguishable, high, levels, of, testosterone, combined, with, low, levels, of, cortisol, and, or, serotonin, have, been, theorized, as, contributing, factors, testosterone, is, associated, with, approach, related, behavior, reward, sensitivity, and, fear, reduction, and, injecting, testosterone, shift, the, balance, from, punishment, to, reward, sensitivity, decreases, fearfulness, and, increases, responding, to, angry, faces, some, studies, have, found, that, high, testosterone, levels, are, associated, with, antisocial, and, aggressive, behaviors, yet, other, research, suggests, that, testosterone, alone, does, not, cause, aggression, but, increases, dominance, seeking, it, is, unclear, from, studies, if, psychopathy, correlates, with, high, testosterone, levels, but, a, few, studies, have, found, that, disruption, of, serotonin, neurotransmission, disrupts, cortisol, reactivity, to, a, stress, inducing, speech, task, thus, dysregulation, of, serotonin, in, the, brain, may, contribute, to, the, low, cortisol, levels, observed, in, psychopathy, cortisol, increases, withdrawal, behavior, and, sensitivity, to, punishment, and, aversive, conditioning, which, are, abnormally, low, in, individuals, with, psychopathy, and, may, underlie, their, impaired, aversion, learning, and, disinhibited, behavior, high, testosterone, levels, combined, with, low, serotonin, levels, are, associated, with, impulsive, and, highly, negative, reactions, and, may, increase, violent, aggression, when, an, individual, is, provoked, or, becomes, frustrated, several, animal, studies, note, the, role, of, serotonergic, functioning, in, impulsive, aggression, and, antisocial, behavior, however, some, studies, on, animal, and, human, subjects, have, suggested, that, the, emotional, interpersonal, traits, and, predatory, aggression, of, psychopathy, in, contrast, to, impulsive, and, reactive, aggression, is, related, to, increased, serotoninergic, functioning, a, study, by, dolan, and, anderson, regarding, the, relationship, between, serotonin, and, psychopathic, traits, in, a, sample, of, personality, disordered, offenders, found, that, serotonin, functioning, as, measured, by, prolactin, response, while, inversely, associated, with, impulsive, and, antisocial, traits, were, positively, correlated, with, arrogant, and, deceitful, traits, and, to, a, lesser, extent, callous, and, remorseless, traits, bari, yildirim, theorizes, that, the, 5, httlpr, long, allele, which, is, generally, regarded, as, protective, against, internalizing, disorders, may, interact, with, other, serotoninergic, genes, to, create, a, hyper, regulation, and, dampening, of, affective, processes, that, results, in, psychopathy, s, emotional, impairments, furthermore, the, combination, of, the, 5, httlpr, long, allele, and, high, testosterone, levels, has, been, found, to, result, in, a, reduced, response, to, threat, as, measured, by, cortisol, reactivity, which, mirrors, the, fear, deficits, found, in, those, with, psychopathy, studies, have, suggested, other, correlations, psychopathy, was, associated, in, two, studies, with, an, increased, ratio, of, hva, a, dopamine, metabolite, to, 5, hiaa, a, serotonin, metabolite, studies, have, found, that, individuals, with, the, traits, meeting, criteria, for, psychopathy, show, a, greater, dopamine, response, to, potential, rewards, such, as, monetary, promises, or, taking, drugs, such, as, amphetamines, this, has, been, theoretically, linked, to, increased, impulsivity, a, 2010, british, study, found, that, a, large, 2d, 4d, digit, ratio, an, indication, of, high, prenatal, estrogen, exposure, was, a, positive, correlate, of, psychopathy, in, females, and, a, positive, correlate, of, callous, affect, psychopathy, sub, scale, in, males, findings, have, also, shown, monoamine, oxidase, a, to, affect, the, predictive, ability, of, the, pcl, r, monoamine, oxidases, maos, are, enzymes, that, are, involved, in, the, breakdown, of, neurotransmitters, such, as, serotonin, and, dopamine, and, are, therefore, capable, of, influencing, feelings, mood, and, behavior, in, individuals, findings, suggest, that, further, research, is, needed, in, this, area, psychopathy, is, most, commonly, assessed, with, the, psychopathy, checklist, revised, pcl, r, created, by, robert, d, hare, based, on, cleckley, s, criteria, from, the, 1940s, criminological, concepts, such, as, those, of, william, and, joan, mccord, and, his, own, research, on, criminals, and, incarcerated, offenders, in, canada, the, pcl, r, is, widely, used, and, is, referred, to, by, some, as, the, gold, standard, for, assessing, psychopathy, there, are, nonetheless, numerous, criticisms, of, the, pcl, r, as, a, theoretical, tool, and, in, real, world, usage, unlike, the, pcl, the, psychopathic, personality, inventory, ppi, was, developed, to, comprehensively, index, personality, traits, without, explicitly, referring, to, antisocial, or, criminal, behaviors, themselves, it, is, a, self, report, scale, that, was, developed, originally, for, non, clinical, samples, e, g, university, students, rather, than, prisoners, though, may, be, used, with, the, latter, it, was, revised, in, 2005, to, become, the, ppi, r, and, now, comprises, 154, items, organized, into, eight, subscales, the, item, scores, have, been, found, to, group, into, two, overarching, and, largely, separate, factors, unlike, the, pcl, r, factors, fearless, dominance, and, impulsive, antisociality, plus, a, third, factor, coldheartedness, which, is, largely, dependent, on, scores, on, the, other, two, factor, 1, is, associated, with, social, efficacy, while, factor, 2, is, associated, with, maladaptive, tendencies, a, person, may, score, at, different, levels, on, the, different, factors, but, the, overall, score, indicates, the, extent, of, psychopathic, personality, the, triarchic, psychopathy, measure, otherwise, known, as, the, tripm, is, a, 58, item, self, report, assessment, that, measures, psychopathy, within, the, three, traits, identified, in, the, triarchic, model, boldness, meanness, and, disinhibition, each, trait, is, measured, on, separate, subscales, and, added, up, resulting, in, a, total, psychopathy, score, the, tripm, includes, various, components, of, other, measures, for, assessing, psychopathy, including, meanness, and, disinhibition, patterns, within, the, psychopathic, personality, however, there, are, differing, approaches, in, the, measurement, of, the, boldness, construct, the, boldness, construct, is, used, to, highlighting, the, social, and, interpersonal, implications, of, the, psychopathic, personality, there, are, currently, two, widely, established, systems, for, classifying, mental, disorders, the, international, classification, of, diseases, icd, produced, by, the, world, health, organization, who, and, the, diagnostic, and, statistical, manual, of, mental, disorders, dsm, produced, by, the, american, psychiatric, association, apa, both, list, categories, of, disorders, thought, to, be, distinct, types, and, have, deliberately, converged, their, codes, in, recent, revisions, so, that, the, manuals, are, often, broadly, comparable, although, significant, differences, remain, the, first, edition, of, the, dsm, in, 1952, had, a, section, on, sociopathic, personality, disturbances, then, a, general, term, that, included, such, things, as, homosexuality, and, alcoholism, as, well, as, an, antisocial, reaction, and, dyssocial, reaction, the, latter, two, eventually, became, antisocial, personality, disorder, aspd, in, the, dsm, and, dissocial, personality, disorder, in, the, icd, both, manuals, have, stated, that, their, diagnoses, have, been, referred, to, or, include, what, is, referred, to, as, psychopathy, or, sociopathy, although, neither, diagnostic, manual, has, ever, included, a, disorder, officially, titled, as, such, there, are, some, traditional, personality, tests, that, contain, subscales, relating, to, psychopathy, though, they, assess, relatively, non, specific, tendencies, towards, antisocial, or, criminal, behavior, these, include, the, minnesota, multiphasic, personality, inventory, psychopathic, deviate, scale, california, psychological, inventory, socialization, scale, and, millon, clinical, multiaxial, inventory, antisocial, personality, disorder, scale, there, is, also, the, levenson, self, report, psychopathy, scale, lsrp, and, the, hare, self, report, psychopathy, scale, hsrp, but, in, terms, of, self, report, tests, the, ppi, ppi, r, has, become, more, used, than, either, of, these, in, modern, psychopathy, research, on, adults, studies, suggest, strong, comorbidity, between, psychopathy, and, antisocial, personality, disorder, among, numerous, studies, positive, correlations, have, also, been, reported, between, psychopathy, and, histrionic, narcissistic, borderline, paranoid, and, schizoid, personality, disorders, panic, and, obsessive, compulsive, disorders, but, not, neurotic, disorders, in, general, schizophrenia, or, depression, factor, 1, and, the, boldness, scale, of, psychopathy, measurements, are, associated, with, narcissism, and, histrionic, personality, disorder, this, is, due, to, a, psychopath, s, cognitive, and, affective, egocentrism, however, while, a, narcissistic, individual, might, view, themselves, as, confident, they, might, seek, out, validation, and, attention, from, others, to, validate, their, self, worth, whereas, a, psychopathic, individual, usually, lacks, such, ambitions, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, is, known, to, be, highly, comorbid, with, conduct, disorder, a, theorized, precursor, to, aspd, and, may, also, co, occur, with, psychopathic, tendencies, this, may, be, explained, in, part, by, deficits, in, executive, function, anxiety, disorders, often, co, occur, with, aspd, and, contrary, to, assumptions, psychopathy, can, sometimes, be, marked, by, anxiety, this, appears, to, be, related, to, items, from, factor, 2, but, not, factor, 1, of, the, pcl, r, psychopathy, is, also, associated, with, substance, use, disorders, michael, fitzgerald, suggested, overlaps, between, primary, psychopathy, and, asperger, syndrome, in, terms, of, fearlessness, planning, of, acts, empathy, deficits, callous, behaviour, and, sometimes, superficial, charisma, studies, investigating, similarities, and, differences, between, psychopathy, and, autism, indicate, that, autism, and, psychopathy, are, not, part, of, the, same, construct, rather, both, conditions, might, co, occur, in, some, individuals, recent, studies, indicate, that, some, individuals, with, an, autism, diagnosis, also, show, callous, and, unemotional, traits, a, risk, factor, for, developing, psychopathy, but, are, less, strongly, associated, with, conduct, problems, likewise, some, people, with, an, asperger, syndrome, diagnosis, have, shown, correlations, with, the, unemotional, factor, and, behavioural, dyscontrol, factor, of, psychopathy, but, not, the, interpersonal, factor, it, has, been, suggested, that, psychopathy, may, be, comorbid, with, several, other, conditions, than, these, but, limited, work, on, comorbidity, has, been, carried, out, this, may, be, partly, due, to, difficulties, in, using, inpatient, groups, from, certain, institutions, to, assess, comorbidity, owing, to, the, likelihood, of, some, bias, in, sample, selection, research, on, psychopathy, has, largely, been, done, on, men, and, the, pcl, r, was, developed, using, mainly, male, criminal, samples, raising, the, question, of, how, well, the, results, apply, to, women, men, score, higher, than, women, on, both, the, pcl, r, and, the, ppi, and, on, both, of, their, main, scales, the, differences, tend, to, be, somewhat, larger, on, the, interpersonal, affective, scale, than, on, the, antisocial, scale, most, but, not, all, studies, have, found, broadly, similar, factor, structure, for, men, and, women, many, associations, with, other, personality, traits, are, similar, although, in, one, study, the, antisocial, factor, was, more, strongly, related, with, impulsivity, in, men, and, more, strongly, related, with, openness, to, experience, in, women, it, has, been, suggested, that, psychopathy, in, men, manifest, more, as, an, antisocial, pattern, while, in, women, it, manifests, more, as, a, histrionic, pattern, studies, on, this, have, shown, mixed, results, pcl, r, scores, may, be, somewhat, less, predictive, of, violence, and, recidivism, in, women, on, the, other, hand, psychopathy, may, have, a, stronger, relationship, with, suicide, and, possibly, internalizing, symptoms, in, women, a, suggestion, is, that, psychopathy, manifests, more, as, externalizing, behaviors, in, men, and, more, as, internalizing, behaviors, in, women, furthermore, one, study, has, suggested, substantial, gender, differences, were, found, in, the, etiology, of, psychopathy, for, girls, 75, of, the, variance, in, severe, callous, and, unemotional, traits, was, attributable, to, environmental, factors, and, just, 0, of, the, variance, was, attributable, to, genetic, factors, in, boys, the, link, was, reversed, studies, have, also, found, that, women, in, prison, score, significantly, lower, on, psychopathy, than, men, with, one, study, reporting, only, 11, percent, of, violent, females, in, prison, met, the, psychopathy, criteria, in, comparison, to, 31, percent, of, violent, males, other, studies, have, also, indicated, that, high, psychopathic, females, are, rare, in, forensic, settings, psychopathy, has, often, been, considered, untreatable, its, unique, characteristics, makes, it, among, the, most, refractory, of, personality, disorders, a, class, of, mental, illnesses, that, are, already, traditionally, considered, difficult, to, treat, people, with, psychopathy, are, generally, unmotivated, to, seek, treatment, for, their, condition, and, can, be, uncooperative, in, therapy, attempts, to, treat, psychopathy, with, the, current, tools, available, to, psychiatry, have, been, disappointing, harris, and, rice, s, handbook, of, psychopathy, says, that, there, is, currently, little, evidence, for, a, cure, or, effective, treatment, for, psychopathy, as, yet, no, pharmacological, therapies, are, known, to, or, have, been, trialed, for, alleviating, the, emotional, interpersonal, and, moral, deficits, of, psychopathy, and, patients, with, psychopathy, who, undergo, psychotherapy, might, gain, the, skills, to, become, more, adept, at, the, manipulation, and, deception, of, others, and, be, more, likely, to, commit, crime, some, studies, suggest, that, punishment, and, behavior, modification, techniques, are, ineffective, at, modifying, the, behavior, of, psychopathic, individuals, as, they, are, insensitive, to, punishment, or, threat, these, failures, have, led, to, a, widely, pessimistic, view, on, its, treatment, prospects, a, view, that, is, exacerbated, by, the, little, research, being, done, into, psychopathy, compared, to, the, efforts, committed, to, other, mental, illnesses, which, makes, it, more, difficult, to, gain, the, understanding, of, this, condition, that, is, necessary, to, develop, effective, therapies, although, the, core, character, deficits, of, highly, psychopathic, individuals, are, likely, to, be, highly, incorrigible, to, the, currently, available, treatment, methods, the, antisocial, and, criminal, behavior, associated, with, it, may, be, more, amenable, to, management, the, management, of, which, being, the, main, aim, of, therapy, programs, in, correctional, settings, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, treatments, that, may, be, most, likely, to, be, effective, at, reducing, overt, antisocial, and, criminal, behavior, are, those, that, focus, on, self, interest, emphasizing, the, tangible, material, value, of, prosocial, behavior, with, interventions, that, develop, skills, to, obtain, what, the, patient, wants, out, of, life, in, prosocial, rather, than, antisocial, ways, to, this, end, various, therapies, have, been, tried, with, the, aim, of, reducing, the, criminal, activity, of, incarcerated, offenders, with, psychopathy, with, mixed, success, as, psychopathic, individuals, are, insensitive, to, sanction, reward, based, management, in, which, small, privileges, are, granted, in, exchange, for, good, behavior, has, been, suggested, and, used, to, manage, their, behavior, in, institutional, settings, psychiatric, medications, may, also, alleviate, co, occurring, conditions, sometimes, associated, with, psychopathy, or, with, symptoms, such, as, aggression, or, impulsivity, including, antipsychotic, antidepressant, or, mood, stabilizing, medications, although, none, have, yet, been, approved, by, the, fda, for, this, purpose, for, example, a, study, found, that, the, antipsychotic, clozapine, may, be, effective, in, reducing, various, behavioral, dysfunctions, in, a, sample, of, high, security, hospital, inpatients, with, antisocial, personality, disorder, and, psychopathic, traits, however, research, into, the, pharmacological, treatment, of, psychopathy, and, the, related, condition, antisocial, personality, disorder, is, minimal, with, much, of, the, knowledge, in, this, area, being, extrapolations, based, on, what, is, known, about, pharmacology, in, other, mental, disorders, the, pcl, r, the, pcl, sv, and, the, pcl, yv, are, highly, regarded, and, widely, used, in, criminal, justice, settings, particularly, in, north, america, they, may, be, used, for, risk, assessment, and, for, assessing, treatment, potential, and, be, used, as, part, of, the, decisions, regarding, bail, sentence, which, prison, to, use, parole, and, regarding, whether, a, youth, should, be, tried, as, a, juvenile, or, as, an, adult, there, have, been, several, criticisms, against, its, use, in, legal, settings, they, include, the, general, criticisms, against, the, pcl, r, the, availability, of, other, risk, assessment, tools, which, may, have, advantages, and, the, excessive, pessimism, surrounding, the, prognosis, and, treatment, possibilities, of, those, who, are, diagnosed, with, psychopathy, the, interrater, reliability, of, the, pcl, r, can, be, high, when, used, carefully, in, research, but, tend, to, be, poor, in, applied, settings, in, particular, factor, 1, items, are, somewhat, subjective, in, sexually, violent, predator, cases, the, pcl, r, scores, given, by, prosecution, experts, were, consistently, higher, than, those, given, by, defense, experts, in, one, study, the, scoring, may, also, be, influenced, by, other, differences, between, raters, in, one, study, it, was, estimated, that, of, the, pcl, r, variance, about, 45, was, due, to, true, offender, differences, 20, was, due, to, which, side, the, rater, testified, for, and, 30, was, due, to, other, rater, differences, to, aid, a, criminal, investigation, certain, interrogation, approaches, may, be, used, to, exploit, and, leverage, the, personality, traits, of, suspects, thought, to, have, psychopathy, and, make, them, more, likely, to, divulge, information, the, pcl, r, score, cut, off, for, a, label, of, psychopathy, is, 25, out, of, 40, in, the, united, kingdom, instead, of, 30, as, it, is, in, the, united, states, in, the, united, kingdom, psychopathic, disorder, was, legally, defined, in, the, mental, health, act, uk, under, mha1983, as, a, persistent, disorder, or, disability, of, mind, whether, or, not, including, significant, impairment, of, intelligence, which, results, in, abnormally, aggressive, or, seriously, irresponsible, conduct, on, the, part, of, the, person, concerned, this, term, was, intended, to, reflect, the, presence, of, a, personality, disorder, in, terms, of, conditions, for, detention, under, the, mental, health, act, 1983, amendments, to, mha1983, within, the, mental, health, act, 2007, abolished, the, term, psychopathic, disorder, with, all, conditions, for, detention, e, g, mental, illness, personality, disorder, etc, encompassed, by, the, generic, term, of, mental, disorder, in, england, and, wales, the, diagnosis, of, dissocial, personality, disorder, is, grounds, for, detention, in, secure, psychiatric, hospitals, under, the, mental, health, act, if, they, have, committed, serious, crimes, but, since, such, individuals, are, disruptive, to, other, patients, and, not, responsive, to, usual, treatment, methods, this, alternative, to, traditional, incarceration, is, often, not, used, starting, in, the, 1930s, before, some, modern, concepts, of, psychopathy, were, developed, sexual, psychopath, laws, the, term, referring, broadly, to, mental, illness, were, introduced, by, some, states, and, by, the, mid, 1960s, more, than, half, of, the, states, had, such, laws, sexual, offenses, were, considered, to, be, caused, by, underlying, mental, illnesses, and, it, was, thought, that, sex, offenders, should, be, treated, in, agreement, with, the, general, rehabilitative, trends, at, this, time, courts, committed, sex, offenders, to, a, mental, health, facility, for, community, protection, and, treatment, starting, in, 1970, many, of, these, laws, were, modified, or, abolished, in, favor, of, more, traditional, responses, such, as, imprisonment, due, to, criticism, of, the, sexual, psychopath, concept, as, lacking, scientific, evidence, the, treatment, being, ineffective, and, predictions, of, future, offending, being, dubious, there, were, also, a, series, of, cases, where, persons, treated, and, released, committed, new, sexual, offenses, starting, in, the, 1990s, several, states, have, passed, sexually, dangerous, person, laws, including, registration, housing, restrictions, public, notification, mandatory, reporting, by, health, care, professionals, and, civil, commitment, which, permits, indefinite, confinement, after, a, sentence, has, been, completed, psychopathy, measurements, may, be, used, in, the, confinement, decision, process, the, prognosis, for, psychopathy, in, forensic, and, clinical, settings, is, quite, poor, with, some, studies, reporting, that, treatment, may, worsen, the, antisocial, aspects, of, psychopathy, as, measured, by, recidivism, rates, though, it, is, noted, that, one, of, the, frequently, cited, studies, finding, increased, criminal, recidivism, after, treatment, a, 2011, retrospective, study, of, a, treatment, program, in, the, 1960s, had, several, serious, methodological, problems, and, likely, would, not, be, approved, of, today, however, some, relatively, rigorous, quasi, experimental, studies, using, more, modern, treatment, methods, have, found, improvements, regarding, reducing, future, violent, and, other, criminal, behavior, regardless, of, pcl, r, scores, although, none, were, randomized, controlled, trials, various, other, studies, have, found, improvements, in, risk, factors, for, crime, such, as, substance, abuse, no, study, has, yet, examined, whether, the, personality, traits, that, form, the, core, character, disturbances, of, psychopathy, could, be, changed, by, such, treatments, a, 2008, study, using, the, pcl, sv, found, that, 1, 2, of, a, us, sample, scored, 13, or, more, out, of, 24, indicating, potential, psychopathy, the, scores, correlated, significantly, with, violence, alcohol, use, and, lower, intelligence, a, 2009, british, study, by, coid, et, al, also, using, the, pcl, sv, reported, a, community, prevalence, of, 0, 6, scoring, 13, or, more, however, if, the, scoring, was, adjusted, to, the, recommended, 18, or, more, this, would, have, left, the, prevalence, closer, to, 0, 1, the, scores, correlated, with, younger, age, male, gender, suicide, attempts, violence, imprisonment, homelessness, drug, dependence, personality, disorders, histrionic, borderline, and, antisocial, and, panic, and, obsessive, compulsive, disorders, psychopathy, has, a, much, higher, prevalence, in, the, convicted, and, incarcerated, population, where, it, is, thought, that, an, estimated, 15, 25, of, prisoners, qualify, for, the, diagnosis, a, study, on, a, sample, of, inmates, in, the, uk, found, that, 7, 7, of, the, inmates, interviewed, met, the, pcl, r, cut, off, of, 30, for, a, diagnosis, of, psychopathy, a, study, on, a, sample, of, inmates, in, iran, using, the, pcl, sv, found, a, prevalence, of, 23, scoring, 18, or, more, a, study, by, nathan, brooks, from, bond, university, found, that, around, one, in, five, corporate, bosses, display, clinically, significant, psychopathic, traits, a, proportion, similar, to, that, among, prisoners, there, is, limited, research, on, psychopathy, in, the, general, work, populace, in, part, because, the, pcl, r, includes, antisocial, behavior, as, a, significant, core, factor, obtaining, a, pcl, r, score, above, the, threshold, is, unlikely, without, having, significant, scores, on, the, antisocial, lifestyle, factor, and, does, not, include, positive, adjustment, characteristics, and, most, researchers, have, studied, psychopathy, in, incarcerated, criminals, a, relatively, accessible, population, of, research, subjects, however, psychologists, fritzon, and, board, in, their, study, comparing, the, incidence, of, personality, disorders, in, business, executives, against, criminals, detained, in, a, mental, hospital, found, that, the, profiles, of, some, senior, business, managers, contained, significant, elements, of, personality, disorders, including, those, referred, to, as, the, emotional, components, or, interpersonal, affective, traits, of, psychopathy, factors, such, as, boldness, disinhibition, and, meanness, as, defined, in, the, triarchic, model, in, combination, with, other, advantages, such, as, a, favorable, upbringing, and, high, intelligence, are, thought, to, correlate, with, stress, immunity, and, stability, and, may, contribute, to, this, particular, expression, such, individuals, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, successful, psychopaths, or, corporate, psychopaths, and, they,
