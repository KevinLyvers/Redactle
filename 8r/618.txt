hummingbirds, are, birds, native, to, the, americas, and, comprise, the, biological, family, trochilidae, with, approximately, 366, species, and, 113, genera, they, occur, from, alaska, to, tierra, del, fuego, but, most, species, are, found, in, central, and, south, america, as, of, 2024, 21, hummingbird, species, are, listed, as, endangered, or, critically, endangered, with, numerous, species, declining, in, population, hummingbirds, have, varied, specialized, characteristics, to, enable, rapid, maneuverable, flight, exceptional, metabolic, capacity, adaptations, to, high, altitude, sensitive, visual, and, communication, abilities, and, long, distance, migration, in, some, species, among, all, birds, male, hummingbirds, have, the, widest, diversity, of, plumage, color, particularly, in, blues, greens, and, purples, hummingbirds, are, the, smallest, mature, birds, measuring, 7, 5, 13, cm, 3, 5, in, in, length, the, smallest, is, the, 5, cm, 2, 0, in, bee, hummingbird, which, weighs, less, than, 2, 0, g, 0, 07, oz, and, the, largest, is, the, 23, cm, 9, in, giant, hummingbird, weighing, 18, 24, grams, 0, 63, 0, 85, oz, noted, for, long, beaks, hummingbirds, are, specialized, for, feeding, on, flower, nectar, but, all, species, also, consume, small, insects, they, are, known, as, hummingbirds, because, of, the, humming, sound, created, by, their, beating, wings, which, flap, at, high, frequencies, audible, to, other, birds, and, humans, they, hover, at, rapid, wing, flapping, rates, which, vary, from, around, 12, beats, per, second, in, the, largest, species, to, 80, per, second, in, small, hummingbirds, hummingbirds, have, the, highest, mass, specific, metabolic, rate, of, any, homeothermic, animal, to, conserve, energy, when, food, is, scarce, and, at, night, when, not, foraging, they, can, enter, torpor, a, state, similar, to, hibernation, and, slow, their, metabolic, rate, to, 1, 15, of, its, normal, rate, while, most, hummingbirds, do, not, migrate, the, rufous, hummingbird, has, one, of, the, longest, migrations, among, birds, traveling, twice, per, year, between, alaska, and, mexico, a, distance, of, about, 3, 900, miles, 6, 300, km, hummingbirds, split, from, their, sister, group, the, swifts, and, treeswifts, around, 42, million, years, ago, the, oldest, known, fossil, hummingbird, is, eurotrochilus, from, the, rupelian, stage, of, early, oligocene, europe, hummingbirds, are, the, smallest, known, and, smallest, living, avian, theropod, dinosaurs, the, iridescent, colors, and, highly, specialized, feathers, of, many, species, mainly, in, males, give, some, hummingbirds, exotic, common, names, such, as, sun, gem, fairy, woodstar, sapphire, or, sylph, across, the, estimated, 366, species, hummingbird, weights, range, from, as, small, as, 2, grams, 0, 071, oz, to, as, large, as, 20, grams, 0, 71, oz, they, have, characteristic, long, narrow, beaks, bills, which, may, be, straight, of, varying, lengths, or, highly, curved, the, bee, hummingbird, only, 6, centimetres, 2, 4, in, long, and, weighing, about, 2, grams, 0, 071, oz, is, the, world, s, smallest, bird, and, smallest, warm, blooded, vertebrate, hummingbirds, have, compact, bodies, with, relatively, long, bladelike, wings, having, anatomical, structure, enabling, helicopter, like, flight, in, any, direction, including, the, ability, to, hover, particularly, while, hovering, the, wing, beats, produce, the, humming, sounds, which, function, to, alert, other, birds, in, some, species, the, tail, feathers, produce, sounds, used, by, males, during, courtship, flying, hummingbirds, have, extremely, rapid, wing, beats, as, high, as, 80, per, second, supported, by, a, high, metabolic, rate, dependent, on, foraging, for, sugars, from, flower, nectar, hummingbird, legs, are, short, with, no, knees, and, have, feet, with, three, toes, pointing, forward, and, one, backward, the, hallux, the, toes, of, hummingbirds, are, formed, as, claws, with, ridged, inner, surfaces, to, aid, gripping, onto, flower, stems, or, petals, hummingbirds, do, not, walk, on, the, ground, or, hop, like, most, birds, but, rather, shuffle, laterally, and, use, their, feet, to, grip, while, perching, preening, feathers, or, nest, building, by, females, and, during, fights, to, grab, feathers, of, opponents, hummingbirds, apply, their, legs, as, pistons, for, generating, thrust, upon, taking, flight, although, the, shortness, of, their, legs, provides, about, 20, less, propulsion, than, assessed, in, other, birds, during, flight, hummingbird, feet, are, tucked, up, under, the, body, enabling, optimal, aerodynamics, and, maneuverability, of, those, species, that, have, been, measured, during, flight, the, top, flight, speeds, of, hummingbirds, exceed, 15, m, s, 54, km, h, 34, mph, during, courtship, some, male, species, dive, from, 30, metres, 100, ft, of, height, above, a, female, at, speeds, around, 23, m, s, 83, km, h, 51, mph, the, sexes, differ, in, feather, coloration, with, males, having, distinct, brilliance, and, ornamentation, of, head, neck, wing, and, breast, feathers, the, most, typical, feather, ornament, in, males, is, the, gorget, a, bib, like, iridescent, neck, feather, patch, that, changes, brilliance, with, the, viewing, angle, to, attract, females, and, warn, male, competitors, away, from, territory, hummingbirds, begin, mating, when, they, are, a, year, old, sex, occurs, over, 3, 5, seconds, when, the, male, joins, its, cloaca, with, the, female, s, passing, sperm, to, fertilize, the, female, s, eggs, hummingbird, females, build, a, nest, resembling, a, small, cup, about, 1, 5, inches, 3, 8, cm, in, diameter, commonly, attached, to, a, tree, branch, using, spider, webs, lichens, moss, and, loose, strings, of, plant, fibers, image, typically, two, pea, shaped, white, eggs, image, the, smallest, of, any, bird, are, incubated, over, 2, 3, weeks, in, breeding, season, fed, by, regurgitation, only, from, the, mother, the, chicks, fledge, about, 3, weeks, after, hatching, the, average, lifespan, of, a, ruby, throated, hummingbird, is, estimated, to, be, 3, 5, years, with, most, deaths, occurring, in, yearlings, although, one, banded, ruby, throated, hummingbird, lived, for, 9, years, and, 2, months, bee, hummingbirds, live, 7, 10, years, although, most, hummingbird, species, live, in, remote, habitats, where, their, population, numbers, are, difficult, to, assess, population, studies, in, the, united, states, and, canada, indicate, that, the, ruby, throated, hummingbird, numbers, are, around, 34, million, rufous, hummingbirds, are, around, 19, million, black, chinned, anna, s, and, broad, tailed, hummingbirds, are, about, 8, million, each, calliopes, at, 4, million, and, costa, s, and, allen, s, hummingbirds, are, around, 2, million, each, several, species, exist, only, in, the, thousands, or, hundreds, according, to, the, international, union, for, conservation, of, nature, red, list, of, threatened, species, in, 2024, 8, hummingbird, species, are, classified, as, critically, endangered, 13, are, endangered, 13, are, vulnerable, and, 20, species, are, near, threatened, two, species, the, brace, s, emerald, riccordia, bracei, and, caribbean, emerald, riccordia, elegans, have, been, declared, extinct, of, the, 15, species, of, north, american, hummingbirds, that, inhabit, the, united, states, and, canada, several, have, changed, their, range, of, distribution, while, others, showed, declines, in, numbers, since, the, 1970s, including, in, 2023, with, dozens, of, hummingbird, species, in, decline, as, of, the, 21st, century, rufous, costa, s, calliope, broad, tailed, and, allen, s, hummingbirds, are, in, significant, decline, some, losing, as, much, as, 67, of, their, numbers, since, 1970, at, nearly, double, the, rate, of, population, loss, over, the, previous, 50, years, the, ruby, throated, hummingbird, population, the, most, populous, north, american, hummingbird, decreased, by, 17, over, the, early, 21st, century, habitat, loss, glass, collisions, cat, predation, pesticides, and, possibly, climate, change, affecting, food, availability, migration, signals, and, breeding, are, factors, that, may, contribute, to, declining, hummingbird, numbers, by, contrast, anna, s, hummingbirds, had, large, population, growth, at, an, accelerating, rate, since, 2010, and, expanded, their, range, northward, to, reside, year, round, in, cold, winter, climates, some, species, of, sunbirds, an, old, world, group, restricted, in, distribution, to, eurasia, africa, and, australia, resemble, hummingbirds, in, appearance, and, behavior, but, are, not, related, to, hummingbirds, as, their, resemblance, is, due, to, convergent, evolution, the, hummingbird, moth, has, flying, and, feeding, characteristics, similar, to, those, of, a, hummingbird, hummingbirds, may, be, mistaken, for, hummingbird, hawk, moths, which, are, large, flying, insects, with, hovering, capabilities, and, exist, only, in, eurasia, hummingbirds, are, restricted, to, the, americas, from, south, central, alaska, to, tierra, del, fuego, including, the, caribbean, the, majority, of, species, occur, in, tropical, and, subtropical, central, and, south, america, but, several, species, also, breed, in, temperate, climates, and, some, hillstars, occur, even, in, alpine, andean, highlands, at, altitudes, up, to, 5, 200, m, 17, 100, ft, the, greatest, species, richness, is, in, humid, tropical, and, subtropical, forests, of, the, northern, andes, and, adjacent, foothills, but, the, number, of, species, found, in, the, atlantic, forest, central, america, or, southern, mexico, also, far, exceeds, the, number, found, in, southern, south, america, the, caribbean, islands, the, united, states, and, canada, while, fewer, than, 25, different, species, of, hummingbirds, have, been, recorded, from, the, united, states, and, fewer, than, 10, from, canada, and, chile, each, colombia, alone, has, more, than, 160, and, the, comparably, small, ecuador, has, about, 130, species, the, family, trochilidae, was, introduced, in, 1825, by, irish, zoologist, nicholas, aylward, vigors, with, trochilus, as, the, type, genus, in, traditional, taxonomy, hummingbirds, are, placed, in, the, order, apodiformes, which, also, contains, the, swifts, but, some, taxonomists, have, separated, them, into, their, own, order, the, trochiliformes, hummingbirds, wing, bones, are, hollow, and, fragile, making, fossilization, difficult, and, leaving, their, evolutionary, history, poorly, documented, though, scientists, theorize, that, hummingbirds, originated, in, south, america, where, species, diversity, is, greatest, possible, ancestors, of, extant, hummingbirds, may, have, lived, in, parts, of, europe, and, what, is, southern, russia, today, as, of, 2023, 366, hummingbird, species, have, been, identified, they, have, been, traditionally, divided, into, two, subfamilies, the, hermits, subfamily, phaethornithinae, and, the, typical, hummingbirds, subfamily, trochilinae, all, the, others, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, have, shown, though, that, the, hermits, are, sister, to, the, topazes, making, the, former, definition, of, the, trochilinae, not, monophyletic, the, hummingbirds, form, nine, major, clades, the, topazes, and, jacobins, the, hermits, the, mangoes, the, coquettes, the, brilliants, the, giant, hummingbird, patagona, gigas, the, mountaingems, the, bees, and, the, emeralds, the, topazes, and, jacobins, combined, have, the, oldest, split, with, the, rest, of, the, hummingbirds, the, hummingbird, family, has, the, third, greatest, number, of, species, of, any, bird, family, after, the, tyrant, flycatchers, and, the, tanagers, fossil, hummingbirds, are, known, from, the, pleistocene, of, brazil, and, the, bahamas, but, neither, has, yet, been, scientifically, described, and, fossils, and, subfossils, of, a, few, extant, species, are, known, until, recently, older, fossils, had, not, been, securely, identifiable, as, those, of, hummingbirds, in, 2004, gerald, mayr, identified, two, 30, million, year, old, hummingbird, fossils, the, fossils, of, this, primitive, hummingbird, species, named, eurotrochilus, inexpectatus, unexpected, european, hummingbird, had, been, sitting, in, a, museum, drawer, in, stuttgart, they, had, been, unearthed, in, a, clay, pit, at, wiesloch, frauenweiler, south, of, heidelberg, germany, and, because, hummingbirds, were, assumed, to, have, never, occurred, outside, the, americas, were, not, recognized, to, be, hummingbirds, until, mayr, took, a, closer, look, at, them, fossils, of, birds, not, clearly, assignable, to, either, hummingbirds, or, a, related, extinct, family, the, jungornithidae, have, been, found, at, the, messel, pit, and, in, the, caucasus, dating, from, 35, to, 40, million, years, ago, this, indicates, that, the, split, between, these, two, lineages, indeed, occurred, around, that, time, the, areas, where, these, early, fossils, have, been, found, had, a, climate, quite, similar, to, that, of, the, northern, caribbean, or, southernmost, china, during, that, time, the, biggest, remaining, mystery, at, present, is, what, happened, to, hummingbirds, in, the, roughly, 25, million, years, between, the, primitive, eurotrochilus, and, the, modern, fossils, the, astounding, morphological, adaptations, the, decrease, in, size, and, the, dispersal, to, the, americas, and, extinction, in, eurasia, all, occurred, during, this, timespan, dna, dna, hybridization, results, suggest, that, the, main, radiation, of, south, american, hummingbirds, took, place, at, least, partly, in, the, miocene, some, 12, to, 13, million, years, ago, during, the, uplifting, of, the, northern, andes, in, 2013, a, 50, million, year, old, bird, fossil, unearthed, in, wyoming, was, found, to, be, a, predecessor, to, hummingbirds, and, swifts, before, the, groups, diverged, hummingbirds, split, from, other, members, of, apodiformes, the, insectivorous, swifts, family, apodidae, and, treeswifts, family, hemiprocnidae, about, 42, million, years, ago, probably, in, eurasia, despite, their, current, new, world, distribution, the, earliest, species, of, hummingbird, occurred, in, the, early, oligocene, rupelian, about, 34, 28, million, years, ago, of, europe, belonging, to, the, genus, eurotrochilus, having, similar, morphology, to, modern, hummingbirds, a, phylogenetic, tree, unequivocally, indicates, that, modern, hummingbirds, originated, in, south, america, with, the, last, common, ancestor, of, all, living, hummingbirds, living, around, 22, million, years, ago, a, map, of, the, hummingbird, family, tree, reconstructed, from, analysis, of, 284, species, shows, rapid, diversification, from, 22, million, years, ago, hummingbirds, fall, into, nine, main, clades, the, topazes, hermits, mangoes, brilliants, coquettes, the, giant, hummingbird, mountaingems, bees, and, emeralds, defining, their, relationship, to, nectar, bearing, flowering, plants, which, attract, hummingbirds, into, new, geographic, areas, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, of, the, hummingbirds, have, shown, that, the, family, is, composed, of, nine, major, clades, when, edward, dickinson, and, james, van, remsen, jr, updated, the, howard, and, moore, complete, checklist, of, the, birds, of, the, world, for, the, 4th, edition, in, 2013, they, divided, the, hummingbirds, into, six, subfamilies, molecular, phylogenetic, studies, determined, the, relationships, between, the, major, groups, of, hummingbirds, in, the, cladogram, below, the, english, names, are, those, introduced, in, 1997, the, scientific, names, are, those, introduced, in, 2013, florisuginae, topazes, phaethornithinae, hermits, polytminae, mangoes, heliantheini, brilliants, lesbiini, coquettes, patagoninae, giants, lampornithini, mountain, gems, mellisugini, bees, trochilini, emeralds, while, all, hummingbirds, depend, on, flower, nectar, to, fuel, their, high, metabolisms, and, hovering, flight, coordinated, changes, in, flower, and, bill, shape, stimulated, the, formation, of, new, species, of, hummingbirds, and, plants, due, to, this, exceptional, evolutionary, pattern, as, many, as, 140, hummingbird, species, can, coexist, in, a, specific, region, such, as, the, andes, range, the, hummingbird, evolutionary, tree, shows, that, one, key, evolutionary, factor, appears, to, have, been, an, altered, taste, receptor, that, enabled, hummingbirds, to, seek, nectar, upon, maturity, males, of, a, particular, species, phaethornis, longirostris, the, long, billed, hermit, appear, to, be, evolving, a, dagger, like, weapon, on, the, beak, tip, as, a, secondary, sexual, trait, to, defend, mating, areas, the, andes, mountains, appear, to, be, a, particularly, rich, environment, for, hummingbird, evolution, because, diversification, occurred, simultaneously, with, mountain, uplift, over, the, past, 10, million, years, hummingbirds, remain, in, dynamic, diversification, inhabiting, ecological, regions, across, south, america, north, america, and, the, caribbean, indicating, an, enlarging, evolutionary, radiation, within, the, same, geographic, region, hummingbird, clades, coevolved, with, nectar, bearing, plant, clades, affecting, mechanisms, of, pollination, the, same, is, true, for, the, sword, billed, hummingbird, ensifera, ensifera, one, of, the, morphologically, most, extreme, species, and, one, of, its, main, food, plant, clades, passiflora, section, tacsonia, hummingbirds, are, specialized, nectarivores, tied, to, the, ornithophilous, flowers, upon, which, they, feed, this, coevolution, implies, that, morphological, traits, of, hummingbirds, such, as, bill, length, bill, curvature, and, body, mass, are, correlated, with, morphological, traits, of, plants, such, as, corolla, length, curvature, and, volume, some, species, especially, those, with, unusual, bill, shapes, such, as, the, sword, billed, hummingbird, and, the, sicklebills, are, coevolved, with, a, small, number, of, flower, species, even, in, the, most, specialized, hummingbird, plant, mutualisms, the, number, of, food, plant, lineages, of, the, individual, hummingbird, species, increases, with, time, the, bee, hummingbird, mellisuga, helenae, the, world, s, smallest, bird, evolved, to, dwarfism, likely, because, it, had, to, compete, with, long, billed, hummingbirds, having, an, advantage, for, nectar, foraging, from, specialized, flowers, consequently, leading, the, bee, hummingbird, to, more, successfully, compete, for, flower, foraging, against, insects, many, plants, pollinated, by, hummingbirds, produce, flowers, in, shades, of, red, orange, and, bright, pink, although, the, birds, take, nectar, from, flowers, of, other, colors, hummingbirds, can, see, wavelengths, into, the, near, ultraviolet, but, hummingbird, pollinated, flowers, do, not, reflect, these, wavelengths, as, many, insect, pollinated, flowers, do, this, narrow, color, spectrum, may, render, hummingbird, pollinated, flowers, relatively, inconspicuous, to, most, insects, thereby, reducing, nectar, robbing, hummingbird, pollinated, flowers, also, produce, relatively, weak, nectar, averaging, 25, sugars, containing, a, high, proportion, of, sucrose, whereas, insect, pollinated, flowers, typically, produce, more, concentrated, nectars, dominated, by, fructose, and, glucose, hummingbirds, and, the, plants, they, visit, for, nectar, have, a, tight, coevolutionary, association, generally, called, a, plant, bird, mutualistic, network, these, birds, show, high, specialization, and, modularity, especially, in, communities, with, high, species, richness, these, associations, are, also, observed, when, closely, related, hummingbirds, such, as, two, species, of, the, same, genus, visit, distinct, sets, of, flowering, species, hummingbirds, exhibit, sexual, size, dimorphism, according, to, rensch, s, rule, in, which, males, are, smaller, than, females, in, small, bodied, species, and, males, are, larger, than, females, in, large, bodied, species, the, extent, of, this, sexual, size, difference, varies, among, clades, of, hummingbirds, for, example, the, mellisugini, clade, bees, exhibits, a, large, size, dimorphism, with, females, being, larger, than, males, conversely, the, lesbiini, clade, coquettes, displays, very, little, size, dimorphism, males, and, females, are, similar, in, size, sexual, dimorphisms, in, bill, size, and, shape, are, also, present, between, male, and, female, hummingbirds, where, in, many, clades, females, have, longer, more, curved, bills, favored, for, accessing, nectar, from, tall, flowers, for, males, and, females, of, the, same, size, females, tend, to, have, larger, bills, sexual, size, and, bill, differences, likely, evolved, due, to, constraints, imposed, by, courtship, because, mating, displays, of, male, hummingbirds, require, complex, aerial, maneuvers, males, tend, to, be, smaller, than, females, allowing, conservation, of, energy, to, forage, competitively, and, participate, more, frequently, in, courtship, thus, sexual, selection, favors, smaller, male, hummingbirds, female, hummingbirds, tend, to, be, larger, requiring, more, energy, with, longer, beaks, that, allow, for, more, effective, reach, into, crevices, of, tall, flowers, for, nectar, thus, females, are, better, at, foraging, acquiring, flower, nectar, and, supporting, the, energy, demands, of, their, larger, body, size, directional, selection, thus, favors, the, larger, hummingbirds, in, terms, of, acquiring, food, another, evolutionary, cause, of, this, sexual, bill, dimorphism, is, that, the, selective, forces, from, competition, for, nectar, between, the, sexes, of, each, species, drives, sexual, dimorphism, depending, on, which, sex, holds, territory, in, the, species, the, other, sex, having, a, longer, bill, and, being, able, to, feed, on, a, wide, variety, of, flowers, is, advantageous, decreasing, intraspecific, competition, for, example, in, species, of, hummingbirds, where, males, have, longer, bills, males, do, not, hold, a, specific, territory, and, have, a, lek, mating, system, in, species, where, males, have, shorter, bills, than, females, males, defend, their, resources, so, females, benefit, from, a, longer, bill, to, feed, from, a, broader, range, of, flowers, the, hummingbird, plumage, coloration, gamut, particularly, for, blue, green, and, purple, colors, in, the, gorget, and, crown, of, males, occupies, 34, of, the, total, color, space, for, bird, feathers, white, unpigmented, feathers, have, the, lowest, incidence, in, the, hummingbird, color, gamut, hummingbird, plumage, color, diversity, evolved, from, sexual, and, social, selection, on, plumage, coloration, which, correlates, with, the, rate, of, hummingbird, species, development, over, millions, of, years, bright, plumage, colors, in, males, are, part, of, aggressive, competition, for, flower, resources, and, mating, the, bright, colors, result, from, pigmentation, in, the, feathers, and, from, prismal, cells, within, the, top, layers, of, feathers, of, the, head, gorget, breast, back, and, wings, when, sunlight, hits, these, cells, it, is, split, into, wavelengths, that, reflect, to, the, observer, in, varying, degrees, of, intensity, with, the, feather, structure, acting, as, a, diffraction, grating, iridescent, hummingbird, colors, result, from, a, combination, of, refraction, and, pigmentation, since, the, diffraction, structures, themselves, are, made, of, melanin, a, pigment, and, may, also, be, colored, by, carotenoid, pigmentation, and, more, subdued, black, brown, or, gray, colors, dependent, on, melanin, by, merely, shifting, position, feather, regions, of, a, muted, looking, bird, can, instantly, become, fiery, red, or, vivid, green, in, courtship, displays, for, one, example, males, of, the, colorful, anna, s, hummingbird, orient, their, bodies, and, feathers, toward, the, sun, to, enhance, the, display, value, of, iridescent, plumage, toward, a, female, of, interest, one, study, of, anna, s, hummingbirds, found, that, dietary, protein, was, an, influential, factor, in, feather, color, as, birds, receiving, more, protein, grew, significantly, more, colorful, crown, feathers, than, those, fed, a, low, protein, diet, additionally, birds, on, a, high, protein, diet, grew, yellower, higher, hue, green, tail, feathers, than, birds, on, a, low, protein, diet, hummingbirds, are, named, for, the, prominent, humming, sound, their, wingbeats, make, while, flying, and, hovering, to, feed, or, interact, with, other, hummingbirds, humming, serves, communication, purposes, by, alerting, other, birds, of, the, arrival, of, a, fellow, forager, or, potential, mate, the, humming, sound, derives, from, aerodynamic, forces, generated, by, the, downstrokes, and, upstrokes, of, the, rapid, wingbeats, causing, oscillations, and, harmonics, that, evoke, an, acoustic, quality, likened, to, that, of, a, musical, instrument, the, humming, sound, of, hummingbirds, is, unique, among, flying, animals, compared, to, the, whine, of, mosquitoes, buzz, of, bees, and, whoosh, of, larger, birds, the, wingbeats, causing, the, hum, of, hummingbirds, during, hovering, are, achieved, by, elastic, recoil, of, wing, strokes, produced, by, the, main, flight, muscles, the, pectoralis, major, the, main, downstroke, muscle, and, supracoracoideus, the, main, upstroke, muscle, although, hummingbird, eyes, are, small, in, diameter, 5, 6, mm, they, are, accommodated, in, the, skull, by, reduced, skull, ossification, and, occupy, a, larger, proportion, of, the, skull, compared, to, other, birds, and, animals, further, hummingbird, eyes, have, large, corneas, which, comprise, about, 50, of, the, total, transverse, eye, diameter, combined, with, an, extraordinary, density, of, retinal, ganglion, cells, responsible, for, visual, processing, containing, some, 45, 000, neurons, per, mm, 2, the, enlarged, cornea, relative, to, total, eye, diameter, serves, to, increase, the, amount, of, light, perception, by, the, eye, when, the, pupil, is, dilated, maximally, enabling, nocturnal, flight, during, evolution, hummingbirds, adapted, to, the, navigational, needs, of, visual, processing, while, in, rapid, flight, or, hovering, by, development, of, the, exceptionally, dense, array, of, retinal, neurons, allowing, for, increased, spatial, resolution, in, the, lateral, and, frontal, visual, fields, morphological, studies, of, the, hummingbird, brain, showed, that, neuronal, hypertrophy, relatively, the, largest, in, any, bird, exists, in, a, region, called, the, pretectal, nucleus, lentiformis, mesencephali, called, the, nucleus, of, the, optic, tract, in, mammals, responsible, for, refining, dynamic, visual, processing, while, hovering, and, during, rapid, flight, the, enlargement, of, the, brain, region, responsible, for, visual, processing, indicates, an, enhanced, ability, for, perception, and, processing, of, fast, moving, visual, stimuli, encountered, during, rapid, forward, flight, insect, foraging, competitive, interactions, and, high, speed, courtship, a, study, of, broad, tailed, hummingbirds, indicated, that, hummingbirds, have, a, fourth, color, sensitive, visual, cone, humans, have, three, that, detects, ultraviolet, light, and, enables, discrimination, of, non, spectral, colors, possibly, having, a, role, in, flower, identity, courtship, displays, territorial, defense, and, predator, evasion, the, fourth, color, cone, would, extend, the, range, of, visible, colors, for, hummingbirds, to, perceive, ultraviolet, light, and, color, combinations, of, feathers, and, gorgets, colorful, plants, and, other, objects, in, their, environment, enabling, detection, of, as, many, as, five, non, spectral, colors, including, purple, ultraviolet, red, ultraviolet, green, ultraviolet, yellow, and, ultraviolet, purple, hummingbirds, are, highly, sensitive, to, stimuli, in, their, visual, fields, responding, to, even, minimal, motion, in, any, direction, by, reorienting, themselves, in, midflight, their, visual, sensitivity, allows, them, to, precisely, hover, in, place, while, in, complex, and, dynamic, natural, environments, functions, enabled, by, the, lentiform, nucleus, which, is, tuned, to, fast, pattern, velocities, enabling, highly, tuned, control, and, collision, avoidance, during, forward, flight, many, hummingbird, species, exhibit, a, diverse, vocal, repertoire, of, chirps, squeaks, whistles, and, buzzes, vocalizations, vary, in, complexity, and, spectral, content, during, social, interactions, foraging, territorial, defense, courtship, and, mother, nestling, communication, territorial, vocal, signals, may, be, produced, in, rapid, succession, to, discourage, aggressive, encounters, with, the, chirping, rate, and, loudness, increasing, when, intruders, persist, during, the, breeding, season, male, and, female, hummingbirds, vocalize, as, part, of, courtship, hummingbirds, exhibit, vocal, production, learning, to, enable, song, variation, dialects, that, exist, across, the, same, species, for, example, the, blue, throated, hummingbird, s, song, differs, from, typical, oscine, songs, in, its, wide, frequency, range, extending, from, 1, 8, khz, to, about, 30, khz, it, also, produces, ultrasonic, vocalizations, which, do, not, function, in, communication, as, blue, throated, hummingbirds, often, alternate, singing, with, catching, small, flying, insects, it, is, possible, the, ultrasonic, clicks, produced, during, singing, disrupt, insect, flight, patterns, making, insects, more, vulnerable, to, predation, anna, s, costa, s, long, billed, hermits, and, andean, hummingbirds, have, song, dialects, that, vary, across, habitat, locations, and, phylogenetic, clades, the, avian, vocal, organ, the, syrinx, plays, an, important, role, in, understanding, hummingbird, song, production, what, makes, the, hummingbird, s, syrinx, different, from, that, of, other, birds, in, the, apodiformes, order, is, the, presence, of, internal, muscle, structure, accessory, cartilages, and, a, large, tympanum, that, serves, as, an, attachment, point, for, external, muscles, all, of, which, are, adaptations, thought, to, be, responsible, for, the, hummingbird, s, increased, ability, in, pitch, control, and, large, frequency, range, hummingbird, songs, originate, from, at, least, seven, specialized, nuclei, in, the, forebrain, a, genetic, expression, study, showed, that, these, nuclei, enable, vocal, learning, ability, to, acquire, vocalizations, through, imitation, a, rare, trait, known, to, occur, in, only, two, other, groups, of, birds, parrots, and, songbirds, and, a, few, groups, of, mammals, including, humans, whales, and, dolphins, and, bats, within, the, past, 66, million, years, only, hummingbirds, parrots, and, songbirds, out, of, 23, bird, orders, may, have, independently, evolved, seven, similar, forebrain, structures, for, singing, and, vocal, learning, indicating, that, evolution, of, these, structures, is, under, strong, epigenetic, constraints, possibly, derived, from, a, common, ancestor, generally, birds, have, been, assessed, to, vocalize, and, hear, in, the, range, of, 2, 5, khz, with, hearing, sensitivity, falling, with, higher, frequencies, in, the, ecuadorian, hillstar, oreotrochilus, chimborazo, vocalizations, were, recorded, in, the, wild, to, be, at, a, frequency, above, 10, khz, well, outside, of, the, known, hearing, ability, of, most, birds, song, system, nuclei, in, the, hummingbird, brain, are, similar, to, those, songbird, brains, but, the, hummingbird, brain, has, specialized, regions, involved, for, song, processing, hummingbirds, have, the, highest, metabolism, of, all, vertebrate, animals, a, necessity, to, support, the, rapid, beating, of, their, wings, during, hovering, and, fast, forward, flight, during, flight, and, hovering, oxygen, consumption, per, gram, of, muscle, tissue, in, a, hummingbird, is, about, 10, times, higher, than, that, measured, in, elite, human, athletes, hummingbirds, achieve, this, extraordinary, capacity, for, oxygen, consumption, by, an, exceptional, density, and, proximity, of, capillaries, and, mitochondria, in, their, flight, muscles, hummingbirds, are, rare, among, vertebrates, in, their, ability, to, rapidly, make, use, of, ingested, sugars, to, fuel, energetically, expensive, hovering, flight, powering, up, to, 100, of, their, metabolic, needs, with, the, sugars, they, drink, hummingbird, flight, muscles, have, extremely, high, capacities, for, oxidizing, carbohydrates, and, fatty, acids, via, hexokinase, carnitine, palmitoyltransferase, and, citrate, synthase, enzymes, at, rates, that, are, the, highest, known, for, vertebrate, skeletal, muscle, to, sustain, rapid, wingbeats, during, flight, and, hovering, hummingbirds, expend, the, human, equivalent, of, 150, 000, calories, per, day, an, amount, estimated, to, be, 10, times, the, energy, consumption, by, a, marathon, runner, in, competition, hummingbirds, can, use, newly, ingested, sugars, to, fuel, hovering, flight, within, 30, 45, minutes, of, consumption, these, data, suggest, that, hummingbirds, are, able, to, oxidize, sugar, in, flight, muscles, at, rates, rapid, enough, to, satisfy, their, extreme, metabolic, demands, as, indicated, by, a, 2017, review, showing, that, hummingbirds, have, in, their, flight, muscles, a, mechanism, for, direct, oxidation, of, sugars, into, maximal, atp, yield, to, support, a, high, metabolic, rate, for, hovering, foraging, at, altitude, and, migrating, this, adaptation, occurred, through, the, evolutionary, loss, of, a, key, gene, fructose, bisphosphatase, 2, fbp2, coinciding, with, the, onset, of, hovering, by, hummingbirds, estimated, by, fossil, evidence, to, be, some, 35, million, years, ago, without, fbp2, glycolysis, and, mitochondrial, respiration, in, flight, muscles, are, enhanced, enabling, hummingbirds, to, metabolize, sugar, more, efficiently, for, energy, by, relying, on, newly, ingested, sugars, to, fuel, flight, hummingbirds, reserve, their, limited, fat, stores, to, sustain, their, overnight, fasting, during, torpor, or, to, power, migratory, flights, studies, of, hummingbird, metabolism, address, how, a, migrating, ruby, throated, hummingbird, can, cross, 800, km, 500, mi, of, the, gulf, of, mexico, on, a, nonstop, flight, this, hummingbird, like, other, long, distance, migrating, birds, stores, fat, as, a, fuel, reserve, augmenting, its, weight, by, as, much, as, 100, then, enabling, metabolic, fuel, for, flying, over, open, water, the, amount, of, fat, 1, 2, g, used, by, a, migrating, hummingbird, to, cross, the, gulf, of, mexico, in, a, single, flight, is, similar, to, that, used, by, a, human, climbing, about, 50, feet, 15, m, the, heart, rate, of, hummingbirds, can, reach, as, high, as, 1, 260, beats, per, minute, a, rate, measured, in, a, blue, throated, hummingbird, with, a, breathing, rate, of, 250, breaths, per, minute, at, rest, the, high, metabolic, rate, of, hummingbirds, especially, during, rapid, forward, flight, and, hovering, produces, increased, body, heat, that, requires, specialized, mechanisms, of, thermoregulation, for, heat, dissipation, which, becomes, an, even, greater, challenge, in, hot, humid, climates, hummingbirds, dissipate, heat, partially, by, evaporation, through, exhaled, air, and, from, body, structures, with, thin, or, no, feather, covering, such, as, around, the, eyes, shoulders, under, the, wings, patagia, and, feet, while, hovering, hummingbirds, do, not, benefit, from, the, heat, loss, by, air, convection, during, forward, flight, except, for, air, movement, generated, by, their, rapid, wing, beat, possibly, aiding, convective, heat, loss, from, the, extended, feet, smaller, hummingbird, species, such, as, the, calliope, appear, to, adapt, their, relatively, higher, surface, to, volume, ratio, to, improve, convective, cooling, from, air, movement, by, the, wings, when, air, temperatures, rise, above, 36, c, 97, f, thermal, gradients, driving, heat, passively, by, convective, dissipation, from, around, the, eyes, shoulders, and, feet, are, reduced, or, eliminated, requiring, heat, dissipation, mainly, by, evaporation, and, exhalation, in, cold, climates, hummingbirds, retract, their, feet, into, breast, feathers, to, eliminate, skin, exposure, and, minimize, heat, dissipation, the, dynamic, range, of, metabolic, rates, in, hummingbirds, requires, a, parallel, dynamic, range, in, kidney, function, during, a, day, of, nectar, consumption, with, a, corresponding, high, water, intake, that, may, total, five, times, the, body, weight, per, day, hummingbird, kidneys, process, water, via, glomerular, filtration, rates, gfr, in, amounts, proportional, to, water, consumption, thereby, avoiding, overhydration, during, brief, periods, of, water, deprivation, however, such, as, in, nighttime, torpor, gfr, drops, to, zero, preserving, body, water, hummingbird, kidneys, also, have, a, unique, ability, to, control, the, levels, of, electrolytes, after, consuming, nectars, with, high, amounts, of, sodium, and, chloride, or, none, indicating, that, kidney, and, glomerular, structures, must, be, highly, specialized, for, variations, in, nectar, mineral, quality, morphological, studies, on, anna, s, hummingbird, kidneys, showed, adaptations, of, high, capillary, density, in, close, proximity, to, nephrons, allowing, for, precise, regulation, of, water, and, electrolytes, dozens, of, hummingbird, species, live, year, round, in, tropical, mountain, habitats, at, high, altitudes, such, as, in, the, andes, over, ranges, of, 1, 500, metres, 4, 900, ft, to, 5, 200, metres, 17, 100, ft, where, the, partial, pressure, of, oxygen, in, the, air, is, reduced, a, condition, of, hypoxic, challenge, for, the, high, metabolic, demands, of, hummingbirds, in, andean, hummingbirds, living, at, high, elevations, researchers, found, that, the, oxygen, carrying, protein, in, blood, hemoglobin, had, increased, oxygen, binding, affinity, and, that, this, adaptive, effect, likely, resulted, from, evolutionary, mutations, within, the, hemoglobin, molecule, via, specific, amino, acid, changes, due, to, natural, selection, anna, s, hummingbirds, are, the, northernmost, year, round, residents, of, any, hummingbird, anna, s, hummingbirds, were, recorded, in, alaska, as, early, as, 1971, and, resident, in, the, pacific, northwest, since, the, 1960s, particularly, increasing, as, a, year, round, population, during, the, early, 21st, century, scientists, estimate, that, some, anna, s, hummingbirds, overwinter, and, presumably, breed, at, northern, latitudes, where, food, and, shelter, are, available, throughout, winter, tolerating, moderately, cold, winter, temperatures, during, cold, temperatures, anna, s, hummingbirds, gradually, gain, weight, during, the, day, as, they, convert, sugar, to, fat, in, addition, hummingbirds, with, inadequate, stores, of, body, fat, or, insufficient, plumage, are, able, to, survive, periods, of, subfreezing, weather, by, lowering, their, metabolic, rate, and, entering, a, state, of, torpor, while, their, range, was, originally, limited, to, the, chaparral, of, california, and, baja, california, it, expanded, northward, to, oregon, washington, and, british, columbia, and, east, to, arizona, over, the, 1960s, to, 1970s, this, rapid, expansion, is, attributed, to, the, widespread, planting, of, non, native, species, such, as, eucalyptus, as, well, as, the, use, of, urban, bird, feeders, in, combination, with, the, species, natural, tendency, for, extensive, postbreeding, dispersal, in, the, pacific, northwest, the, fastest, growing, populations, occur, in, regions, with, breeding, season, cold, temperatures, similar, to, those, of, its, native, range, northward, expansion, of, the, anna, s, hummingbird, represents, an, ecological, release, associated, with, introduced, plants, year, round, nectar, availability, from, feeders, supplied, by, humans, milder, winter, temperatures, associated, with, climate, change, and, acclimation, of, the, species, to, a, winter, climate, cooler, than, its, native, region, although, quantitative, data, are, absent, it, is, likely, that, a, sizable, percentage, of, anna, s, hummingbirds, in, the, pacific, northwest, still, do, migrate, south, for, winter, as, of, 2017, anna, s, hummingbird, is, the, official, city, bird, of, vancouver, british, columbia, canada, and, is, a, non, migrating, resident, of, seattle, where, it, lives, year, round, through, winter, enduring, extended, periods, of, subfreezing, temperatures, snow, and, high, winds, the, metabolism, of, hummingbirds, can, slow, at, night, or, at, any, time, when, food, is, not, readily, available, the, birds, enter, a, deep, sleep, state, known, as, torpor, to, prevent, energy, reserves, from, falling, to, a, critical, level, one, study, of, broad, tailed, hummingbirds, found, that, body, weight, decreased, linearly, throughout, torpor, at, a, rate, of, 0, 04, g, per, hour, during, nighttime, torpor, body, temperature, in, a, caribbean, hummingbird, was, shown, to, fall, from, 40, to, 18, c, with, heart, and, breathing, rates, slowing, dramatically, heart, rate, of, roughly, 50, to, 180, bpm, from, its, daytime, rate, of, higher, than, 1000, bpm, recordings, from, a, metallura, phoebe, hummingbird, in, noctural, torpor, at, around, 3, 800, metres, 12, 500, ft, in, the, andes, mountains, showed, that, body, temperature, fell, to, 3, 3, c, 38, f, the, lowest, known, level, for, a, bird, or, non, hibernating, mammal, during, cold, nights, at, altitude, hummingbirds, were, in, torpor, for, 2, 13, hours, depending, on, species, with, cooling, occurring, at, the, rate, of, 0, 6, c, per, minute, and, rewarming, at, 1, 1, 5, c, per, minute, high, altitude, andean, hummingbirds, also, lost, body, weight, in, negative, proportion, to, how, long, the, birds, were, in, torpor, losing, about, 6, of, weight, each, night, during, torpor, to, prevent, dehydration, the, kidney, function, declines, preserving, needed, compounds, such, as, glucose, water, and, nutrients, the, circulating, hormone, corticosterone, is, one, signal, that, arouses, a, hummingbird, from, torpor, use, and, duration, of, torpor, vary, among, hummingbird, species, and, are, affected, by, whether, a, dominant, bird, defends, territory, with, nonterritorial, subordinate, birds, having, longer, periods, of, torpor, a, hummingbird, with, a, higher, fat, percentage, will, be, less, likely, to, enter, a, state, of, torpor, compared, to, one, with, less, fat, as, a, bird, can, use, the, energy, from, its, fat, stores, torpor, in, hummingbirds, appears, to, be, unrelated, to, nighttime, temperature, as, it, occurs, across, a, wide, temperature, range, with, energy, savings, of, such, deep, sleep, being, more, related, to, the, photoperiod, and, duration, of, torpor, hummingbirds, have, unusually, long, lifespans, for, organisms, with, such, rapid, metabolisms, though, many, die, during, their, first, year, of, life, especially, in, the, vulnerable, period, between, hatching, and, fledging, those, that, survive, may, occasionally, live, a, decade, or, more, among, the, better, known, north, american, species, the, typical, lifespan, is, probably, 3, to, 5, years, for, comparison, the, smaller, shrews, among, the, smallest, of, all, mammals, seldom, live, longer, than, 2, years, the, longest, recorded, lifespan, in, the, wild, relates, to, a, female, broad, tailed, hummingbird, that, was, banded, as, an, adult, at, least, one, year, old, then, recaptured, 11, years, later, making, her, at, least, 12, years, old, other, longevity, records, for, banded, hummingbirds, include, an, estimated, minimum, age, of, 10, years, 1, month, for, a, female, black, chinned, hummingbird, similar, in, size, to, the, broad, tailed, hummingbird, and, at, least, 11, years, 2, months, for, a, much, larger, buff, bellied, hummingbird, praying, mantises, have, been, observed, as, predators, of, hummingbirds, other, predators, include, domestic, cats, dragonflies, frogs, orb, weaver, spiders, and, other, birds, such, as, the, roadrunner, hummingbirds, host, a, highly, specialized, lice, fauna, two, genera, of, ricinid, lice, trochiloecetes, and, trochiliphagus, are, specialized, on, them, often, infesting, 5, 15, of, their, populations, in, contrast, two, genera, of, menoponid, lice, myrsidea, and, leremenopon, are, extremely, rare, on, them, male, hummingbirds, do, not, take, part, in, nesting, most, species, build, a, cup, shaped, nest, on, the, branch, of, a, tree, or, shrub, the, nest, varies, in, size, relative, to, the, particular, species, from, smaller, than, half, a, walnut, shell, to, several, centimeters, in, diameter, many, hummingbird, species, use, spider, silk, and, lichen, to, bind, the, nest, material, together, and, secure, the, structure, the, unique, properties, of, the, silk, allow, the, nest, to, expand, as, the, young, hummingbirds, grow, two, white, eggs, are, laid, which, despite, being, the, smallest, of, all, bird, eggs, are, large, relative, to, the, adult, hummingbird, s, size, incubation, lasts, 14, to, 23, days, depending, on, the, species, ambient, temperature, and, female, attentiveness, to, the, nest, the, mother, feeds, her, nestlings, on, small, arthropods, and, nectar, by, inserting, her, bill, into, the, open, mouth, of, a, nestling, and, then, regurgitating, the, food, into, its, crop, hummingbirds, stay, in, the, nest, for, 18, 22, days, after, which, they, leave, the, nest, to, forage, on, their, own, although, the, mother, bird, may, continue, feeding, them, for, another, 25, days, hummingbird, flight, has, been, studied, intensively, from, an, aerodynamic, perspective, using, wind, tunnels, and, high, speed, video, cameras, two, studies, of, rufous, or, anna, s, hummingbirds, in, a, wind, tunnel, used, particle, image, velocimetry, techniques, to, investigate, the, lift, generated, on, the, bird, s, upstroke, and, downstroke, the, birds, produced, 75, of, their, weight, support, during, the, downstroke, and, 25, during, the, upstroke, with, the, wings, making, a, figure, 8, motion, many, earlier, studies, had, assumed, that, lift, was, generated, equally, during, the, two, phases, of, the, wingbeat, cycle, as, is, the, case, of, insects, of, a, similar, size, this, finding, shows, that, hummingbird, hovering, is, similar, to, but, distinct, from, that, of, hovering, insects, such, as, the, hawk, moth, further, studies, using, electromyography, in, hovering, rufous, hummingbirds, showed, that, muscle, strain, in, the, pectoralis, major, principal, downstroke, muscle, was, the, lowest, yet, recorded, in, a, flying, bird, and, the, primary, upstroke, muscle, supracoracoideus, is, proportionately, larger, than, in, other, bird, species, presumably, due, to, rapid, wingbeats, for, flight, and, hovering, hummingbird, wings, have, adapted, to, perform, without, an, alula, the, giant, hummingbird, s, wings, beat, as, few, as, 12, times, per, second, and, the, wings, of, typical, hummingbirds, beat, up, to, 80, times, per, second, as, air, density, decreases, for, example, at, higher, altitudes, the, amount, of, power, a, hummingbird, must, use, to, hover, increases, hummingbird, species, adapted, for, life, at, higher, altitudes, therefore, have, larger, wings, to, help, offset, these, negative, effects, of, low, air, density, on, lift, generation, a, slow, motion, video, has, shown, how, the, hummingbirds, deal, with, rain, when, they, are, flying, to, remove, the, water, from, their, heads, they, shake, their, heads, and, bodies, similar, to, a, dog, shaking, to, shed, water, further, when, raindrops, collectively, may, weigh, as, much, as, 38, of, the, bird, s, body, weight, hummingbirds, shift, their, bodies, and, tails, horizontally, beat, their, wings, faster, and, reduce, their, wings, angle, of, motion, when, flying, in, heavy, rain, the, highest, recorded, wingbeat, rate, for, hummingbirds, during, hovering, is, 99, 1, per, second, as, measured, for, male, woodstars, chaetocercus, sp, males, in, the, genus, chaetocercus, have, been, recorded, above, 100, beats, per, second, during, courtship, displays, the, number, of, beats, per, second, increases, above, normal, hovering, while, flying, during, courtship, displays, up, to, 90, per, second, for, the, calliope, hummingbird, selasphorus, calliope, a, wingbeat, rate, 40, higher, than, its, typical, hovering, rate, during, turbulent, airflow, conditions, created, experimentally, in, a, wind, tunnel, hummingbirds, exhibit, stable, head, positions, and, orientation, when, they, hover, at, a, feeder, when, wind, gusts, from, the, side, hummingbirds, compensate, by, increasing, wing, stroke, amplitude, and, stroke, plane, angle, and, by, varying, these, parameters, asymmetrically, between, the, wings, and, from, one, stroke, to, the, next, they, also, vary, the, orientation, and, enlarge, the, collective, surface, area, of, their, tail, feathers, into, the, shape, of, a, fan, while, hovering, the, visual, system, of, a, hummingbird, is, able, to, separate, apparent, motion, caused, by, the, movement, of, the, hummingbird, itself, from, motions, caused, by, external, sources, such, as, an, approaching, predator, in, natural, settings, full, of, highly, complex, background, motion, hummingbirds, are, able, to, precisely, hover, in, place, by, rapid, coordination, of, vision, with, body, position, when, courting, the, male, anna, s, hummingbird, ascends, some, 35, m, 115, ft, above, a, female, before, diving, at, a, speed, of, 27, m, s, 89, ft, s, equal, to, 385, body, lengths, sec, producing, a, high, pitched, sound, near, the, female, at, the, nadir, of, the, dive, this, downward, acceleration, during, a, dive, is, the, highest, reported, for, any, vertebrate, undergoing, a, voluntary, aerial, maneuver, in, addition, to, acceleration, the, speed, relative, to, body, length, is, the, highest, known, for, any, vertebrate, for, instance, it, is, about, twice, the, diving, speed, of, peregrine, falcons, in, pursuit, of, prey, at, maximum, descent, speed, about, 10, g, of, gravitational, force, occur, in, the, courting, hummingbird, during, a, dive, note, g, force, is, generated, as, the, bird, pulls, out, of, the, dive, the, outer, tail, feathers, of, male, anna, s, calypte, anna, and, selasphorus, hummingbirds, e, g, allen, s, calliope, vibrate, during, courtship, display, dives, and, produce, an, audible, chirp, caused, by, aeroelastic, flutter, hummingbirds, cannot, make, the, courtship, dive, sound, when, missing, their, outer, tail, feathers, and, those, same, feathers, could, produce, the, dive, sound, in, a, wind, tunnel, the, bird, can, sing, at, the, same, frequency, as, the, tail, feather, chirp, but, its, small, syrinx, is, not, capable, of, the, same, volume, the, sound, is, caused, by, the, aerodynamics, of, rapid, air, flow, past, tail, feathers, causing, them, to, flutter, in, a, vibration, which, produces, the, high, pitched, sound, of, a, courtship, dive, many, other, species, of, hummingbirds, also, produce, sounds, with, their, wings, or, tails, while, flying, hovering, or, diving, including, the, wings, of, the, calliope, hummingbird, broad, tailed, hummingbird, rufous, hummingbird, allen, s, hummingbird, and, the, streamertail, species, as, well, as, the, tail, of, the, costa, s, hummingbird, and, the, black, chinned, hummingbird, and, a, number, of, related, species, the, harmonics, of, sounds, during, courtship, dives, vary, across, species, of, hummingbirds, male, rufous, and, broad, tailed, hummingbirds, genus, selasphorus, have, a, distinctive, wing, feature, during, normal, flight, that, sounds, like, jingling, or, a, buzzing, shrill, whistle, a, trill, the, trill, arises, from, air, rushing, through, slots, created, by, the, tapered, tips, of, the, ninth, and, tenth, primary, wing, feathers, creating, a, sound, loud, enough, to, be, detected, by, female, or, competitive, male, hummingbirds, and, researchers, up, to, 100, m, away, behaviorally, the, trill, serves, several, purposes, it, announces, the, sex, and, presence, of, a, male, bird, it, provides, audible, aggressive, defense, of, a, feeding, territory, and, an, intrusion, tactic, it, enhances, communication, of, a, threat, and, it, favors, mate, attraction, and, courtship, relatively, few, hummingbirds, migrate, as, a, percentage, of, the, total, number, of, species, of, the, roughly, 366, known, hummingbird, species, only, 12, 15, species, migrate, annually, particularly, those, in, north, america, most, hummingbirds, live, in, the, amazonia, central, america, tropical, rainforest, belt, where, seasonal, temperature, changes, and, food, sources, are, relatively, constant, obviating, the, need, to, migrate, as, the, smallest, living, birds, hummingbirds, are, relatively, limited, at, conserving, heat, energy, and, are, generally, unable, to, maintain, a, presence, in, higher, latitudes, during, winter, months, unless, the, specific, location, has, a, large, food, supply, throughout, the, year, particularly, access, to, flower, nectar, other, migration, factors, are, seasonal, fluctuation, of, food, climate, competition, for, resources, predators, and, inherent, signals, most, north, american, hummingbirds, migrate, southward, in, fall, to, spend, winter, in, mexico, the, caribbean, islands, or, central, america, a, few, species, are, year, round, residents, of, florida, california, and, the, southwestern, desert, regions, of, the, us, among, these, are, anna, s, hummingbird, a, common, resident, from, southern, arizona, and, inland, california, and, the, buff, bellied, hummingbird, a, winter, resident, from, florida, across, the, gulf, coast, to, south, texas, ruby, throated, hummingbirds, are, common, along, the, atlantic, flyway, and, migrate, in, summer, from, as, far, north, as, atlantic, canada, returning, to, mexico, south, america, southern, texas, and, florida, to, winter, during, winter, in, southern, louisiana, black, chinned, buff, bellied, calliope, allen, s, anna, s, ruby, throated, rufous, broad, tailed, and, broad, billed, hummingbirds, are, present, the, rufous, hummingbird, breeds, farther, north, than, any, other, species, of, hummingbird, spending, summers, along, coastal, british, columbia, and, alaska, and, wintering, in, the, southwestern, united, states, and, mexico, with, some, distributed, along, the, coasts, of, the, subtropical, gulf, of, mexico, and, florida, by, migrating, in, spring, as, far, north, as, the, yukon, or, southern, alaska, the, rufous, hummingbird, migrates, more, extensively, and, nests, farther, north, than, any, other, hummingbird, species, and, must, tolerate, occasional, temperatures, below, freezing, in, its, breeding, territory, this, cold, hardiness, enables, it, to, survive, temperatures, below, freezing, provided, that, adequate, shelter, and, food, are, available, as, calculated, by, displacement, of, body, size, the, rufous, hummingbird, makes, perhaps, the, longest, migratory, journey, of, any, bird, in, the, world, at, just, over, 3, inches, 7, 6, cm, long, rufous, hummingbirds, travel, 3, 900, miles, 6, 300, km, one, way, from, alaska, to, mexico, in, late, summer, a, distance, equal, to, 78, 470, 000, body, lengths, then, make, the, return, journey, in, the, following, spring, by, comparison, the, 13, inches, 33, cm, long, arctic, tern, makes, a, one, way, flight, of, about, 18, 000, kilometres, 11, 000, mi, or, 51, 430, 000, body, lengths, just, 65, of, the, body, displacement, during, migration, by, rufous, hummingbirds, the, northward, migration, of, rufous, hummingbirds, occurs, along, the, pacific, flyway, and, may, be, time, coordinated, with, flower, and, tree, leaf, emergence, in, early, spring, and, also, with, availability, of, insects, as, food, arrival, at, breeding, grounds, before, nectar, availability, from, mature, flowers, may, jeopardize, breeding, opportunities, all, hummingbirds, are, overwhelmingly, nectarivorous, being, by, far, the, most, specialized, such, feeders, among, birds, as, well, as, the, only, birds, for, whom, nectar, typically, comprises, the, vast, majority, of, energy, intake, hummingbirds, exhibit, numerous, and, extensive, adaptations, to, nectarivory, including, long, probing, bills, and, tongues, which, rapidly, take, up, fluids, hummingbirds, also, possess, the, most, sophisticated, hovering, flight, of, all, birds, a, necessity, for, rapidly, visiting, many, flowers, without, perching, their, intestines, are, capable, of, extracting, over, 99, of, the, glucose, from, nectar, feedings, within, minutes, owing, to, high, densities, of, glucose, transporters, the, highest, known, among, vertebrates, as, among, the, most, important, vertebrate, pollinators, hummingbirds, have, coevolved, in, complex, ways, with, flowering, plants, thousands, of, new, world, species, have, evolved, to, be, pollinated, exclusively, by, hummingbirds, even, barring, access, to, insect, pollinators, in, some, plants, these, mechanisms, which, include, highly, modified, corollas, even, render, their, nectaries, inaccessible, to, all, but, certain, hummingbirds, i, e, those, possessing, appropriate, beak, morphologies, although, some, hummingbirds, rob, nectar, to, overcome, this, bird, pollinated, plants, also, termed, ornithophilous, were, formerly, thought, to, exemplify, very, close, mutualisms, with, specific, flowering, plants, coevolving, alongside, specific, hummingbirds, in, mutualistic, pairings, both, ornithophilous, plants, and, hummingbirds, are, now, known, to, not, be, nearly, selective, enough, for, this, to, be, true, less, accessible, ornithophiles, for, example, those, requiring, long, bills, still, rely, on, multiple, hummingbird, species, for, pollination, more, importantly, hummingbirds, tend, not, to, be, especially, selective, nectar, feeders, even, regularly, visiting, non, ornithophilous, plants, as, well, as, ornithophiles, which, appear, poorly, suited, for, feeding, by, their, species, feeding, efficiency, is, optimized, however, when, birds, feed, on, flowers, better, suited, to, their, bill, morphologies, although, they, may, not, be, one, to, one, there, are, still, marked, overall, preferences, for, certain, genera, families, and, orders, of, flowering, plants, by, hummingbirds, in, general, as, well, as, by, certain, species, of, hummingbird, flowers, which, are, attractive, to, hummingbirds, are, often, colorful, particularly, red, open, diurnally, and, produce, nectar, with, a, high, sucrose, content, in, ornithophilous, plants, the, corollas, are, often, elongated, and, tubular, and, they, may, be, scentless, several, of, these, are, adaptations, discouraging, insect, visitation, some, common, genera, consumed, by, many, species, include, castilleja, centropogon, costus, delphinium, heliconia, hibiscus, inga, and, mimulus, some, of, these, are, primarily, insect, pollinated, three, californian, species, were, found, to, feed, from, 62, plant, families, in, 30, orders, with, the, most, frequently, occurring, orders, being, apiales, fabales, lamiales, and, rosales, a, hummingbird, may, have, to, visit, one, or, two, thousand, flowers, daily, to, meet, energy, demands, although, a, high, quality, source, of, energy, nectar, is, deficient, in, many, macro, and, micronutrients, it, tends, to, be, low, in, lipids, and, although, it, may, contain, trace, quantities, of, amino, acids, some, essential, acids, are, severely, or, entirely, lacking, though, hummingbird, protein, requirements, appear, to, be, quite, small, at, 1, 5, of, the, diet, nectar, is, still, an, inadequate, source, most, if, not, all, hummingbirds, therefore, supplement, their, diet, with, the, consumption, of, invertebrates, insectivory, is, not, thought, to, be, calorically, important, nonetheless, regular, consumption, of, arthropods, is, considered, crucial, for, birds, to, thrive, in, fact, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, majority, of, non, caloric, nutritional, needs, of, hummingbirds, are, met, by, insectivory, but, nectars, do, contain, appreciable, quantities, of, certain, vitamins, and, minerals, here, insectivory, refers, to, the, consumption, of, any, arthropod, not, exclusively, insects, though, not, as, insectivorous, as, once, believed, and, far, less, so, than, most, of, their, relatives, and, ancestors, among, the, strisores, e, g, swifts, insectivory, is, probably, of, regular, importance, to, most, hummingbirds, about, 95, of, individuals, from, 140, species, in, one, study, showed, evidence, of, arthropod, consumption, while, another, study, found, arthropod, remains, in, 79, of, over, 1600, birds, from, sites, across, south, and, central, america, some, species, have, even, been, recorded, to, be, largely, or, entirely, insectivorous, for, periods, of, time, particularly, when, nectar, sources, are, scarce, and, possibly, for, some, species, with, seasonal, regularity, in, areas, with, a, wet, season, observations, of, seasonal, near, exclusive, insectivory, have, been, made, for, blue, throated, hummingbirds, as, well, as, swallow, tailed, hummingbirds, in, an, urban, park, in, brazil, in, arizona, when, nearby, nectar, sources, were, seemingly, absent, a, nesting, female, broad, tailed, hummingbird, was, recorded, feeding, only, on, arthropods, for, two, weeks, other, studies, report, 70, 100, of, feeding, time, devoted, to, arthropods, these, accounts, suggest, a, degree, of, adaptability, particularly, when, appropriate, nectar, sources, are, unavailable, although, nectarivory, always, predominates, when, flowers, are, abundant, e, g, in, non, seasonal, tropical, habitats, in, addition, the, aforementioned, arizona, study, only, surveyed, a, small, portion, of, the, study, area, and, mostly, did, not, observe, the, bird, while, she, was, off, the, nest, similar, concerns, have, been, raised, for, other, reports, leading, to, skepticism, over, whether, hummingbirds, can, in, fact, subsist, without, nectar, for, extended, periods, at, all, hummingbirds, exhibit, various, feeding, strategies, and, some, morphological, adaptations, for, insectivory, typically, they, hawk, for, small, flying, insects, but, also, glean, spiders, from, their, webs, bill, shape, may, play, a, role, as, hummingbirds, with, longer, or, more, curved, bills, may, be, unable, to, hawk, efficiently, and, so, rely, more, heavily, on, gleaning, spiders, regardless, of, bill, shape, spiders, are, a, common, prey, item, other, very, common, prey, items, include, flies, especially, those, of, the, family, chironomidae, as, well, as, various, hymenopterans, such, as, wasps, and, ants, and, hemipterans, the, aforementioned, california, study, found, three, species, to, consume, invertebrates, from, 72, families, in, 15, orders, with, flies, alone, occurring, in, over, 90, of, samples, the, three, species, exhibited, high, dietary, overlap, with, little, evidence, for, niche, partitioning, this, suggests, that, prey, availability, is, not, a, limiting, resource, for, hummingbirds, estimates, of, overall, dietary, makeup, for, hummingbirds, vary, but, insectivory, is, often, cited, as, comprising, 5, 15, of, feeding, time, budgets, typically, 2, 12, is, a, figure, that, is, also, cited, in, one, study, 84, of, feeding, time, was, allotted, to, nectar, feeding, if, breeding, females, are, included, and, 89, otherwise, 86, of, total, feeding, records, were, on, nectar, it, has, been, estimated, based, on, time, budgets, and, other, data, that, the, hummingbird, diet, is, generally, about, 90, nectar, and, 10, arthropods, by, mass, as, their, nestlings, consume, only, arthropods, and, possibly, because, their, own, requirements, increase, breeding, females, spend, 3, 4, times, as, long, as, males, foraging, for, arthropods, although, 65, 70, of, their, feeding, time, is, still, devoted, to, nectar, estimates, for, overall, insectivory, can, be, as, low, as, 5, such, low, numbers, have, been, documented, for, some, species, insects, comprised, 3, of, foraging, attempts, for, peruvian, shining, sunbeams, in, one, study, while, the, purple, throated, carib, has, been, reported, to, spend, 1, of, time, consuming, insects, in, dominica, both, species, also, have, more, typical, numbers, recorded, elsewhere, however, overall, for, most, hummingbirds, insectivory, is, an, essential, and, regular, albeit, minor, component, of, the, diet, while, nectar, is, the, primary, feeding, focus, when, conditions, allow, it, has, been, shown, that, floral, abundance, but, not, floral, diversity, influences, hummingbird, diversity, but, that, arthropod, abundance, does, not, i, e, that, it, is, non, limiting, hummingbirds, do, not, spend, all, day, flying, as, the, energy, cost, would, be, prohibitive, the, majority, of, their, activity, consists, simply, of, sitting, or, perching, hummingbirds, eat, many, small, meals, and, consume, around, half, their, weight, in, nectar, twice, their, weight, in, nectar, if, the, nectar, is, 25, sugar, each, day, hummingbirds, digest, their, food, rapidly, due, to, their, small, size, and, high, metabolism, a, mean, retention, time, less, than, an, hour, has, been, reported, hummingbirds, spend, an, average, of, 20, of, their, time, feeding, and, 75, 80, sitting, and, digesting, because, their, high, metabolism, makes, them, vulnerable, to, starvation, hummingbirds, are, highly, attuned, to, food, sources, some, species, including, many, found, in, north, america, are, territorial, and, try, to, guard, food, sources, such, as, a, feeder, against, other, hummingbirds, attempting, to, ensure, a, future, food, supply, additionally, hummingbirds, have, an, enlarged, hippocampus, a, brain, region, facilitating, spatial, memory, used, to, map, flowers, previously, visited, during, nectar, foraging, the, shapes, of, hummingbird, beaks, also, called, bills, vary, widely, as, an, adaptation, for, specialized, feeding, with, some, 7000, flowering, plants, pollinated, by, hummingbird, nectar, feeding, hummingbird, beak, lengths, range, from, about, 6, millimetres, 0, 24, in, to, as, long, as, 110, millimetres, 4, 3, in, when, catching, insects, in, flight, a, hummingbird, s, jaw, flexes, downward, to, widen, the, beak, for, successful, capture, the, extreme, curved, beaks, of, sicklebills, are, adapted, for, extracting, nectar, from, the, curved, corolla, tubes, of, centropogon, flowers, some, species, such, as, hermits, phaethornis, spp, have, long, beaks, that, enable, insertion, deeply, into, flowers, with, long, corolla, tubes, thornbills, have, short, sharp, beaks, adapted, for, feeding, from, flowers, with, short, corolla, tubes, and, piercing, the, bases, of, longer, ones, the, beak, of, the, fiery, tailed, awlbill, has, an, upturned, tip, adapted, for, feeding, on, nectar, from, tubular, flowers, while, hovering, perception, of, sweetness, in, nectar, evolved, in, hummingbirds, during, their, genetic, divergence, from, insectivorous, swifts, their, closest, bird, relatives, although, the, only, known, sweet, sensory, receptor, called, t1r2, is, absent, in, birds, receptor, expression, studies, showed, that, hummingbirds, adapted, a, carbohydrate, receptor, from, the, t1r1, t1r3, receptor, identical, to, the, one, perceived, as, umami, in, humans, essentially, repurposing, it, to, function, as, a, nectar, sweetness, receptor, this, adaptation, for, taste, enabled, hummingbirds, to, detect, and, exploit, sweet, nectar, as, an, energy, source, facilitating, their, distribution, across, geographical, regions, where, nectar, bearing, flowers, are, available, hummingbirds, drink, with, their, long, tongues, by, rapidly, lapping, nectar, their, tongues, have, semicircular, tubes, which, run, down, their, lengths, to, facilitate, nectar, consumption, via, rapid, pumping, in, and, out, of, the, nectar, while, capillary, action, was, believed, to, be, what, drew, nectar, into, these, tubes, high, speed, photography, revealed, that, the, tubes, open, down, their, sides, as, the, tongue, goes, into, the, nectar, and, then, close, around, the, nectar, trapping, it, so, it, can, be, pulled, back, into, the, beak, over, a, period, of, 14, milliseconds, per, lick, at, a, rate, of, up, to, 20, licks, per, second, the, tongue, which, is, forked, is, compressed, until, it, reaches, nectar, then, the, tongue, springs, open, the, rapid, action, traps, the, nectar, which, moves, up, the, grooves, like, a, pump, action, with, capillary, action, not, involved, consequently, tongue, flexibility, enables, accessing, transporting, and, unloading, nectar, via, pump, action, not, by, a, capillary, syphon, as, once, believed, in, the, wild, hummingbirds, visit, flowers, for, food, extracting, nectar, which, is, 55, sucrose, 24, glucose, and, 21, fructose, on, a, dry, matter, basis, hummingbirds, also, take, sugar, water, from, bird, feeders, which, allow, people, to, observe, and, enjoy, hummingbirds, up, close, while, providing, the, birds, with, a, reliable, source, of, energy, especially, when, flower, blossoms, are, less, abundant, a, negative, aspect, of, artificial, feeders, however, is, that, the, birds, may, seek, less, flower, nectar, for, food, and, so, may, reduce, the, amount, of, pollination, their, feeding, naturally, provides, white, granulated, sugar, is, used, in, hummingbird, feeders, in, a, 20, concentration, as, a, common, recipe, although, hummingbirds, will, defend, feeders, more, aggressively, when, sugar, content, is, at, 35, indicating, preference, for, nectar, with, higher, sugar, content, organic, and, raw, sugars, contain, iron, which, can, be, harmful, and, brown, sugar, agave, syrup, molasses, and, artificial, sweeteners, also, should, not, be, used, honey, is, made, by, bees, from, the, nectar, of, flowers, but, it, is, not, good, to, use, in, feeders, because, when, it, is, diluted, with, water, microorganisms, easily, grow, in, it, causing, it, to, spoil, rapidly, red, food, dye, was, once, thought, to, be, a, favorable, ingredient, for, the, nectar, in, home, feeders, but, it, is, unnecessary, commercial, products, sold, as, instant, nectar, or, hummingbird, food, may, also, contain, preservatives, or, artificial, flavors, as, well, as, dyes, which, are, unnecessary, and, potentially, harmful, although, some, commercial, products, contain, small, amounts, of, nutritional, additives, hummingbirds, obtain, all, necessary, nutrients, from, the, insects, they, eat, rendering, added, nutrients, unnecessary, hummingbirds, have, exceptional, visual, acuity, providing, them, with, discrimination, of, food, sources, while, foraging, although, hummingbirds, are, thought, to, be, attracted, to, color, while, seeking, food, such, as, red, flowers, or, artificial, feeders, experiments, indicate, that, location, and, flower, nectar, quality, are, the, most, important, beacons, for, foraging, hummingbirds, depend, little, on, visual, cues, of, flower, color, to, beacon, to, nectar, rich, locations, but, rather, they, use, surrounding, landmarks, to, find, the, nectar, reward, in, at, least, one, hummingbird, species, the, green, backed, firecrown, sephanoides, sephaniodes, flower, colors, preferred, are, in, the, red, green, wavelength, for, the, bird, s, visual, system, providing, a, higher, contrast, than, for, other, flower, colors, further, the, crown, plumage, of, firecrown, males, is, highly, iridescent, in, the, red, wavelength, range, peak, at, 650, nanometers, possibly, providing, a, competitive, advantage, of, dominance, when, foraging, among, other, hummingbird, species, with, less, colorful, plumage, the, ability, to, discriminate, colors, of, flowers, and, plumage, is, enabled, by, a, visual, system, having, four, single, cone, cells, and, a, double, cone, screened, by, photoreceptor, oil, droplets, which, enhance, color, discrimination, while, hummingbirds, rely, primarily, on, vision, and, hearing, to, assess, competition, from, bird, and, insect, foragers, near, food, sources, they, may, also, be, able, to, detect, by, smell, the, presence, in, nectar, of, insect, defensive, chemicals, such, as, formic, acid, and, aggregation, pheromones, of, foraging, ants, which,
