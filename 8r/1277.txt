the, brain, is, the, central, organ, of, the, human, nervous, system, and, with, the, spinal, cord, makes, up, the, central, nervous, system, the, brain, consists, of, the, cerebrum, the, brainstem, and, the, cerebellum, it, controls, most, of, the, activities, of, the, body, processing, integrating, and, coordinating, the, information, it, receives, from, the, sense, organs, and, making, decisions, as, to, the, instructions, sent, to, the, rest, of, the, body, the, brain, is, contained, in, and, protected, by, the, skull, bones, of, the, head, the, cerebrum, the, largest, part, of, the, human, brain, consists, of, two, cerebral, hemispheres, each, hemisphere, has, an, inner, core, composed, of, white, matter, and, an, outer, surface, the, cerebral, cortex, composed, of, grey, matter, the, cortex, has, an, outer, layer, the, neocortex, and, an, inner, allocortex, the, neocortex, is, made, up, of, six, neuronal, layers, while, the, allocortex, has, three, or, four, each, hemisphere, is, divided, into, four, lobes, the, frontal, temporal, parietal, and, occipital, lobes, the, frontal, lobe, is, associated, with, executive, functions, including, self, control, planning, reasoning, and, abstract, thought, while, the, occipital, lobe, is, dedicated, to, vision, within, each, lobe, cortical, areas, are, associated, with, specific, functions, such, as, the, sensory,

neural, crest, the, neural, crest, runs, the, length, of, the, tube, with, cranial, neural, crest, cells, at, the, cephalic, end, and, caudal, neural, crest, cells, at, the, tail, cells, detach, from, the, crest, and, migrate, in, a, craniocaudal, head, to, tail, wave, inside, the, tube, cells, at, the, cephalic, end, give, rise, to, the, brain, and, cells, at, the, caudal, end, give, rise, to, the, spinal, cord, the, tube, flexes, as, it, grows, forming, the, crescent, shaped, cerebral, hemispheres, at, the, head, the, cerebral, hemispheres, first, appear, on, day, 32, early, in, the, fourth, week, the, cephalic, part, bends, sharply, forward, in, a, cephalic, flexure, this, flexed, part, becomes, the, forebrain, prosencephalon, the, adjoining, curving, part, becomes, the, midbrain, mesencephalon, and, the, part, caudal, to, the, flexure, becomes, the, hindbrain, rhombencephalon, these, areas, are, formed, as, swellings, known, as, the, three, primary, brain, vesicles, in, the, fifth, week, of, development, five, secondary, brain, vesicles, have, formed, the, forebrain, separates, into, two, vesicles, an, anterior, telencephalon, and, a, posterior, diencephalon, the, telencephalon, gives, rise, to, the, cerebral, cortex, basal, ganglia, and, related, structures, the, diencephalon, gives, rise, to, the, thalamus, and, hypothalamus, the, hindbrain, also, splits, into, two, areas, the, metencephalon, and, the, myelencephalon, the, metencephalon, gives, rise, to, the, cerebellum, and, pons, the, myelencephalon, gives, rise, to, the, medulla, oblongata, also, during, the, fifth, week, the, brain, divides, into, repeating, segments, called, neuromeres, in, the, hindbrain, these, are, known, as, rhombomeres, a, characteristic, of, the, brain, is, the, cortical, folding, known, as, gyrification, for, just, over, five, months, of, prenatal, development, the, cortex, is, smooth, by, the, gestational, age, of, 24, weeks, the, wrinkled, morphology, showing, the, fissures, that, begin, to, mark, out, the, lobes, of, the, brain, is, evident, why, the, cortex, wrinkles, and, folds, is, not, well, understood, but, gyrification, has, been, linked, to, intelligence, and, neurological, disorders, and, a, number, of, gyrification, theories, have, been, proposed, these, theories, include, those, based, on, mechanical, buckling, axonal, tension, and, differential, tangential, expansion, what, is, clear, is, that, gyrification, is, not, a, random, process, but, rather, a, complex, developmentally, predetermined, process, which, generates, patterns, of, folds, that, are, consistent, between, individuals, and, most, species, the, first, groove, to, appear, in, the, fourth, month, is, the, lateral, cerebral, fossa, the, expanding, caudal, end, of, the, hemisphere, has, to, curve, over, in, a, forward, direction, to, fit, into, the, restricted, space, this, covers, the, fossa, and, turns, it, into, a, much, deeper, ridge, known, as, the, lateral, sulcus, and, this, marks, out, the, temporal, lobe, by, the, sixth, month, other, sulci, have, formed, that, demarcate, the, frontal, parietal, and, occipital, lobes, a, gene, present, in, the, human, genome, arhgap11b, may, play, a, major, role, in, gyrification, and, encephalisation, the, frontal, lobe, is, involved, in, reasoning, motor, control, emotion, and, language, it, contains, the, motor, cortex, which, is, involved, in, planning, and, coordinating, movement, the, prefrontal, cortex, which, is, responsible, for, higher, level, cognitive, functioning, and, broca, s, area, which, is, essential, for, language, production, the, motor, system, of, the, brain, is, responsible, for, the, generation, and, control, of, movement, generated, movements, pass, from, the, brain, through, nerves, to, motor, neurons, in, the, body, which, control, the, action, of, muscles, the, corticospinal, tract, carries, movements, from, the, brain, through, the, spinal, cord, to, the, torso, and, limbs, the, cranial, nerves, carry, movements, related, to, the, eyes, mouth, and, face, gross, movement, such, as, locomotion, and, the, movement, of, arms, and, legs, is, generated, in, the, motor, cortex, divided, into, three, parts, the, primary, motor, cortex, found, in, the, precentral, gyrus, and, has, sections, dedicated, to, the, movement, of, different, body, parts, these, movements, are, supported, and, regulated, by, two, other, areas, lying, anterior, to, the, primary, motor, cortex, the, premotor, area, and, the, supplementary, motor, area, the, hands, and, mouth, have, a, much, larger, area, dedicated, to, them, than, other, body, parts, allowing, finer, movement, this, has, been, visualised, in, a, motor, homunculus, impulses, generated, from, the, motor, cortex, travel, along, the, corticospinal, tract, along, the, front, of, the, medulla, and, cross, over, decussate, at, the, medullary, pyramids, these, then, travel, down, the, spinal, cord, with, most, connecting, to, interneurons, in, turn, connecting, to, lower, motor, neurons, within, the, grey, matter, that, then, transmit, the, impulse, to, move, to, muscles, themselves, the, cerebellum, and, basal, ganglia, play, a, role, in, fine, complex, and, coordinated, muscle, movements, connections, between, the, cortex, and, the, basal, ganglia, control, muscle, tone, posture, and, movement, initiation, and, are, referred, to, as, the, extrapyramidal, system, the, sensory, nervous, system, is, involved, with, the, reception, and, processing, of, sensory, information, this, information, is, received, through, the, cranial, nerves, through, tracts, in, the, spinal, cord, and, directly, at, centres, of, the, brain, exposed, to, the, blood, the, brain, also, receives, and, interprets, information, from, the, special, senses, of, vision, smell, hearing, and, taste, mixed, motor, and, sensory, signals, are, also, integrated, from, the, skin, the, brain, receives, information, about, fine, touch, pressure, pain, vibration, and, temperature, from, the, joints, the, brain, receives, information, about, joint, position, the, sensory, cortex, is, found, just, near, the, motor, cortex, and, like, the, motor, cortex, has, areas, related, to, sensation, from, different, body, parts, sensation, collected, by, a, sensory, receptor, on, the, skin, is, changed, to, a, nerve, signal, that, is, passed, up, a, series, of, neurons, through, tracts, in, the, spinal, cord, the, dorsal, column, medial, lemniscus, pathway, contains, information, about, fine, touch, vibration, and, position, of, joints, the, pathway, fibres, travel, up, the, back, part, of, the, spinal, cord, to, the, back, part, of, the, medulla, where, they, connect, with, second, order, neurons, that, immediately, send, fibres, across, the, midline, these, fibres, then, travel, upwards, into, the, ventrobasal, complex, in, the, thalamus, where, they, connect, with, third, order, neurons, which, send, fibres, up, to, the, sensory, cortex, the, spinothalamic, tract, carries, information, about, pain, temperature, and, gross, touch, the, pathway, fibres, travel, up, the, spinal, cord, and, connect, with, second, order, neurons, in, the, reticular, formation, of, the, brainstem, for, pain, and, temperature, and, also, terminate, at, the, ventrobasal, complex, of, the, thalamus, for, gross, touch, vision, is, generated, by, light, that, hits, the, retina, of, the, eye, photoreceptors, in, the, retina, transduce, the, sensory, stimulus, of, light, into, an, electrical, nerve, signal, that, is, sent, to, the, visual, cortex, in, the, occipital, lobe, visual, signals, leave, the, retinas, through, the, optic, nerves, optic, nerve, fibres, from, the, retinas, nasal, halves, cross, to, the, opposite, sides, joining, the, fibres, from, the, temporal, halves, of, the, opposite, retinas, to, form, the, optic, tracts, the, arrangements, of, the, eyes, optics, and, the, visual, pathways, mean, vision, from, the, left, visual, field, is, received, by, the, right, half, of, each, retina, is, processed, by, the, right, visual, cortex, and, vice, versa, the, optic, tract, fibres, reach, the, brain, at, the, lateral, geniculate, nucleus, and, travel, through, the, optic, radiation, to, reach, the, visual, cortex, hearing, and, balance, are, both, generated, in, the, inner, ear, sound, results, in, vibrations, of, the, ossicles, which, continue, finally, to, the, hearing, organ, and, change, in, balance, results, in, movement, of, liquids, within, the, inner, ear, this, creates, a, nerve, signal, that, passes, through, the, vestibulocochlear, nerve, from, here, it, passes, through, to, the, cochlear, nuclei, the, superior, olivary, nucleus, the, medial, geniculate, nucleus, and, finally, the, auditory, radiation, to, the, auditory, cortex, the, sense, of, smell, is, generated, by, receptor, cells, in, the, epithelium, of, the, olfactory, mucosa, in, the, nasal, cavity, this, information, passes, via, the, olfactory, nerve, which, goes, into, the, skull, through, a, relatively, permeable, part, this, nerve, transmits, to, the, neural, circuitry, of, the, olfactory, bulb, from, where, information, is, passed, to, the, olfactory, cortex, taste, is, generated, from, receptors, on, the, tongue, and, passed, along, the, facial, and, glossopharyngeal, nerves, into, the, solitary, nucleus, in, the, brainstem, some, taste, information, is, also, passed, from, the, pharynx, into, this, area, via, the, vagus, nerve, information, is, then, passed, from, here, through, the, thalamus, into, the, gustatory, cortex, autonomic, functions, of, the, brain, include, the, regulation, or, rhythmic, control, of, the, heart, rate, and, rate, of, breathing, and, maintaining, homeostasis, blood, pressure, and, heart, rate, are, influenced, by, the, vasomotor, centre, of, the, medulla, which, causes, arteries, and, veins, to, be, somewhat, constricted, at, rest, it, does, this, by, influencing, the, sympathetic, and, parasympathetic, nervous, systems, via, the, vagus, nerve, information, about, blood, pressure, is, generated, by, baroreceptors, in, aortic, bodies, in, the, aortic, arch, and, passed, to, the, brain, along, the, afferent, fibres, of, the, vagus, nerve, information, about, the, pressure, changes, in, the, carotid, sinus, comes, from, carotid, bodies, located, near, the, carotid, artery, and, this, is, passed, via, a, nerve, joining, with, the, glossopharyngeal, nerve, this, information, travels, up, to, the, solitary, nucleus, in, the, medulla, signals, from, here, influence, the, vasomotor, centre, to, adjust, vein, and, artery, constriction, accordingly, the, brain, controls, the, rate, of, breathing, mainly, by, respiratory, centres, in, the, medulla, and, pons, the, respiratory, centres, control, respiration, by, generating, motor, signals, that, are, passed, down, the, spinal, cord, along, the, phrenic, nerve, to, the, diaphragm, and, other, muscles, of, respiration, this, is, a, mixed, nerve, that, carries, sensory, information, back, to, the, centres, there, are, four, respiratory, centres, three, with, a, more, clearly, defined, function, and, an, apneustic, centre, with, a, less, clear, function, in, the, medulla, a, dorsal, respiratory, group, causes, the, desire, to, breathe, in, and, receives, sensory, information, directly, from, the, body, also, in, the, medulla, the, ventral, respiratory, group, influences, breathing, out, during, exertion, in, the, pons, the, pneumotaxic, centre, influences, the, duration, of, each, breath, and, the, apneustic, centre, seems, to, have, an, influence, on, inhalation, the, respiratory, centres, directly, senses, blood, carbon, dioxide, and, ph, information, about, blood, oxygen, carbon, dioxide, and, ph, levels, are, also, sensed, on, the, walls, of, arteries, in, the, peripheral, chemoreceptors, of, the, aortic, and, carotid, bodies, this, information, is, passed, via, the, vagus, and, glossopharyngeal, nerves, to, the, respiratory, centres, high, carbon, dioxide, an, acidic, ph, or, low, oxygen, stimulate, the, respiratory, centres, the, desire, to, breathe, in, is, also, affected, by, pulmonary, stretch, receptors, in, the, lungs, which, when, activated, prevent, the, lungs, from, overinflating, by, transmitting, information, to, the, respiratory, centres, via, the, vagus, nerve, the, hypothalamus, in, the, diencephalon, is, involved, in, regulating, many, functions, of, the, body, functions, include, neuroendocrine, regulation, regulation, of, the, circadian, rhythm, control, of, the, autonomic, nervous, system, and, the, regulation, of, fluid, and, food, intake, the, circadian, rhythm, is, controlled, by, two, main, cell, groups, in, the, hypothalamus, the, anterior, hypothalamus, includes, the, suprachiasmatic, nucleus, and, the, ventrolateral, preoptic, nucleus, which, through, gene, expression, cycles, generates, a, roughly, 24, hour, circadian, clock, in, the, circadian, day, an, ultradian, rhythm, takes, control, of, the, sleeping, pattern, sleep, is, an, essential, requirement, for, the, body, and, brain, and, allows, the, closing, down, and, resting, of, the, body, s, systems, there, are, also, findings, that, suggest, that, the, daily, build, up, of, toxins, in, the, brain, are, removed, during, sleep, whilst, awake, the, brain, consumes, a, fifth, of, the, body, s, total, energy, needs, sleep, necessarily, reduces, this, use, and, gives, time, for, the, restoration, of, energy, giving, atp, the, effects, of, sleep, deprivation, show, the, absolute, need, for, sleep, the, lateral, hypothalamus, contains, orexinergic, neurons, that, control, appetite, and, arousal, through, their, projections, to, the, ascending, reticular, activating, system, the, hypothalamus, controls, the, pituitary, gland, through, the, release, of, peptides, such, as, oxytocin, and, vasopressin, as, well, as, dopamine, into, the, median, eminence, through, the, autonomic, projections, the, hypothalamus, is, involved, in, regulating, functions, such, as, blood, pressure, heart, rate, breathing, sweating, and, other, homeostatic, mechanisms, the, hypothalamus, also, plays, a, role, in, thermal, regulation, and, when, stimulated, by, the, immune, system, is, capable, of, generating, a, fever, the, hypothalamus, is, influenced, by, the, kidneys, when, blood, pressure, falls, the, renin, released, by, the, kidneys, stimulates, a, need, to, drink, the, hypothalamus, also, regulates, food, intake, through, autonomic, signals, and, hormone, release, by, the, digestive, system, while, language, functions, were, traditionally, thought, to, be, localised, to, wernicke, s, area, and, broca, s, area, it, is, now, mostly, accepted, that, a, wider, network, of, cortical, regions, contributes, to, language, functions, the, study, on, how, language, is, represented, processed, and, acquired, by, the, brain, is, called, neurolinguistics, which, is, a, large, multidisciplinary, field, drawing, from, cognitive, neuroscience, cognitive, linguistics, and, psycholinguistics, the, cerebrum, has, a, contralateral, organisation, with, each, hemisphere, of, the, brain, interacting, primarily, with, one, half, of, the, body, the, left, side, of, the, brain, interacts, with, the, right, side, of, the, body, and, vice, versa, this, is, theorized, to, be, caused, by, a, developmental, axial, twist, motor, connections, from, the, brain, to, the, spinal, cord, and, sensory, connections, from, the, spinal, cord, to, the, brain, both, cross, sides, in, the, brainstem, visual, input, follows, a, more, complex, rule, the, optic, nerves, from, the, two, eyes, come, together, at, a, point, called, the, optic, chiasm, and, half, of, the, fibres, from, each, nerve, split, off, to, join, the, other, the, result, is, that, connections, from, the, left, half, of, the, retina, in, both, eyes, go, to, the, left, side, of, the, brain, whereas, connections, from, the, right, half, of, the, retina, go, to, the, right, side, of, the, brain, because, each, half, of, the, retina, receives, light, coming, from, the, opposite, half, of, the, visual, field, the, functional, consequence, is, that, visual, input, from, the, left, side, of, the, world, goes, to, the, right, side, of, the, brain, and, vice, versa, thus, the, right, side, of, the, brain, receives, somatosensory, input, from, the, left, side, of, the, body, and, visual, input, from, the, left, side, of, the, visual, field, the, left, and, right, sides, of, the, brain, appear, symmetrical, but, they, function, asymmetrically, for, example, the, counterpart, of, the, left, hemisphere, motor, area, controlling, the, right, hand, is, the, right, hemisphere, area, controlling, the, left, hand, there, are, however, several, important, exceptions, involving, language, and, spatial, cognition, the, left, frontal, lobe, is, dominant, for, language, if, a, key, language, area, in, the, left, hemisphere, is, damaged, it, can, leave, the, victim, unable, to, speak, or, understand, whereas, equivalent, damage, to, the, right, hemisphere, would, cause, only, minor, impairment, to, language, skills, a, substantial, part, of, current, understanding, of, the, interactions, between, the, two, hemispheres, has, come, from, the, study, of, split, brain, patients, people, who, underwent, surgical, transection, of, the, corpus, callosum, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, the, severity, of, epileptic, seizures, these, patients, do, not, show, unusual, behaviour, that, is, immediately, obvious, but, in, some, cases, can, behave, almost, like, two, different, people, in, the, same, body, with, the, right, hand, taking, an, action, and, then, the, left, hand, undoing, it, these, patients, when, briefly, shown, a, picture, on, the, right, side, of, the, point, of, visual, fixation, are, able, to, describe, it, verbally, but, when, the, picture, is, shown, on, the, left, are, unable, to, describe, it, but, may, be, able, to, give, an, indication, with, the, left, hand, of, the, nature, of, the, object, shown, emotions, are, generally, defined, as, two, step, multicomponent, processes, involving, elicitation, followed, by, psychological, feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic, responses, and, action, tendencies, attempts, to, localise, basic, emotions, to, certain, brain, regions, have, been, controversial, some, research, found, no, evidence, for, specific, locations, corresponding, to, emotions, but, instead, found, circuitry, involved, in, general, emotional, processes, the, amygdala, orbitofrontal, cortex, mid, and, anterior, insula, cortex, and, lateral, prefrontal, cortex, appeared, to, be, involved, in, generating, the, emotions, while, weaker, evidence, was, found, for, the, ventral, tegmental, area, ventral, pallidum, and, nucleus, accumbens, in, incentive, salience, others, however, have, found, evidence, of, activation, of, specific, regions, such, as, the, basal, ganglia, in, happiness, the, subcallosal, cingulate, cortex, in, sadness, and, amygdala, in, fear, the, brain, is, responsible, for, cognition, which, functions, through, numerous, processes, and, executive, functions, executive, functions, include, the, ability, to, filter, information, and, tune, out, irrelevant, stimuli, with, attentional, control, and, cognitive, inhibition, the, ability, to, process, and, manipulate, information, held, in, working, memory, the, ability, to, think, about, multiple, concepts, simultaneously, and, switch, tasks, with, cognitive, flexibility, the, ability, to, inhibit, impulses, and, prepotent, responses, with, inhibitory, control, and, the, ability, to, determine, the, relevance, of, information, or, appropriateness, of, an, action, higher, order, executive, functions, require, the, simultaneous, use, of, multiple, basic, executive, functions, and, include, planning, prospection, and, fluid, intelligence, i, e, reasoning, and, problem, solving, the, prefrontal, cortex, plays, a, significant, role, in, mediating, executive, functions, planning, involves, activation, of, the, dorsolateral, prefrontal, cortex, dlpfc, anterior, cingulate, cortex, angular, prefrontal, cortex, right, prefrontal, cortex, and, supramarginal, gyrus, working, memory, manipulation, involves, the, dlpfc, inferior, frontal, gyrus, and, areas, of, the, parietal, cortex, inhibitory, control, involves, multiple, areas, of, the, prefrontal, cortex, as, well, as, the, caudate, nucleus, and, subthalamic, nucleus, brain, activity, is, made, possible, by, the, interconnections, of, neurons, that, are, linked, together, to, reach, their, targets, a, neuron, consists, of, a, cell, body, axon, and, dendrites, dendrites, are, often, extensive, branches, that, receive, information, in, the, form, of, signals, from, the, axon, terminals, of, other, neurons, the, signals, received, may, cause, the, neuron, to, initiate, an, action, potential, an, electrochemical, signal, or, nerve, impulse, which, is, sent, along, its, axon, to, the, axon, terminal, to, connect, with, the, dendrites, or, with, the, cell, body, of, another, neuron, an, action, potential, is, initiated, at, the, initial, segment, of, an, axon, which, contains, a, specialised, complex, of, proteins, when, an, action, potential, reaches, the, axon, terminal, it, triggers, the, release, of, a, neurotransmitter, at, a, synapse, that, propagates, a, signal, that, acts, on, the, target, cell, these, chemical, neurotransmitters, include, dopamine, serotonin, gaba, glutamate, and, acetylcholine, gaba, is, the, major, inhibitory, neurotransmitter, in, the, brain, and, glutamate, is, the, major, excitatory, neurotransmitter, neurons, link, at, synapses, to, form, neural, pathways, neural, circuits, and, large, elaborate, network, systems, such, as, the, salience, network, and, the, default, mode, network, and, the, activity, between, them, is, driven, by, the, process, of, neurotransmission, the, brain, consumes, up, to, 20, of, the, energy, used, by, the, human, body, more, than, any, other, organ, in, humans, blood, glucose, is, the, primary, source, of, energy, for, most, cells, and, is, critical, for, normal, function, in, a, number, of, tissues, including, the, brain, the, human, brain, consumes, approximately, 60, of, blood, glucose, in, fasted, sedentary, individuals, brain, metabolism, normally, relies, upon, blood, glucose, as, an, energy, source, but, during, times, of, low, glucose, such, as, fasting, endurance, exercise, or, limited, carbohydrate, intake, the, brain, uses, ketone, bodies, for, fuel, with, a, smaller, need, for, glucose, the, brain, can, also, utilize, lactate, during, exercise, the, brain, stores, glucose, in, the, form, of, glycogen, albeit, in, significantly, smaller, amounts, than, that, found, in, the, liver, or, skeletal, muscle, long, chain, fatty, acids, cannot, cross, the, blood, brain, barrier, but, the, liver, can, break, these, down, to, produce, ketone, bodies, however, short, chain, fatty, acids, e, g, butyric, acid, propionic, acid, and, acetic, acid, and, the, medium, chain, fatty, acids, octanoic, acid, and, heptanoic, acid, can, cross, the, blood, brain, barrier, and, be, metabolised, by, brain, cells, although, the, human, brain, represents, only, 2, of, the, body, weight, it, receives, 15, of, the, cardiac, output, 20, of, total, body, oxygen, consumption, and, 25, of, total, body, glucose, utilization, the, brain, mostly, uses, glucose, for, energy, and, deprivation, of, glucose, as, can, happen, in, hypoglycemia, can, result, in, loss, of, consciousness, the, energy, consumption, of, the, brain, does, not, vary, greatly, over, time, but, active, regions, of, the, cortex, consume, somewhat, more, energy, than, inactive, regions, which, forms, the, basis, for, the, functional, neuroimaging, methods, of, pet, and, fmri, these, techniques, provide, a, three, dimensional, image, of, metabolic, activity, a, preliminary, study, showed, that, brain, metabolic, requirements, in, humans, peak, at, about, five, years, old, the, function, of, sleep, is, not, fully, understood, however, there, is, evidence, that, sleep, enhances, the, clearance, of, metabolic, waste, products, some, of, which, are, potentially, neurotoxic, from, the, brain, and, may, also, permit, repair, evidence, suggests, that, the, increased, clearance, of, metabolic, waste, during, sleep, occurs, via, increased, functioning, of, the, glymphatic, system, sleep, may, also, have, an, effect, on, cognitive, function, by, weakening, unnecessary, connections, the, brain, is, not, fully, understood, and, research, is, ongoing, neuroscientists, along, with, researchers, from, allied, disciplines, study, how, the, human, brain, works, the, boundaries, between, the, specialties, of, neuroscience, neurology, and, other, disciplines, such, as, psychiatry, have, faded, as, they, are, all, influenced, by, basic, research, in, neuroscience, neuroscience, research, has, expanded, considerably, the, decade, of, the, brain, an, initiative, of, the, united, states, government, in, the, 1990s, is, considered, to, have, marked, much, of, this, increase, in, research, and, was, followed, in, 2013, by, the, brain, initiative, the, human, connectome, project, was, a, five, year, study, launched, in, 2009, to, analyse, the, anatomical, and, functional, connections, of, parts, of, the, brain, and, has, provided, much, data, an, emerging, phase, in, research, may, be, that, of, simulating, brain, activity, information, about, the, structure, and, function, of, the, human, brain, comes, from, a, variety, of, experimental, methods, including, animals, and, humans, information, about, brain, trauma, and, stroke, has, provided, information, about, the, function, of, parts, of, the, brain, and, the, effects, of, brain, damage, neuroimaging, is, used, to, visualise, the, brain, and, record, brain, activity, electrophysiology, is, used, to, measure, record, and, monitor, the, electrical, activity, of, the, cortex, measurements, may, be, of, local, field, potentials, of, cortical, areas, or, of, the, activity, of, a, single, neuron, an, electroencephalogram, can, record, the, electrical, activity, of, the, cortex, using, electrodes, placed, non, invasively, on, the, scalp, invasive, measures, include, electrocorticography, which, uses, electrodes, placed, directly, on, the, exposed, surface, of, the, brain, this, method, is, used, in, cortical, stimulation, mapping, used, in, the, study, of, the, relationship, between, cortical, areas, and, their, systemic, function, by, using, much, smaller, microelectrodes, single, unit, recordings, can, be, made, from, a, single, neuron, that, give, a, high, spatial, resolution, and, high, temporal, resolution, this, has, enabled, the, linking, of, brain, activity, to, behaviour, and, the, creation, of, neuronal, maps, the, development, of, cerebral, organoids, has, opened, ways, for, studying, the, growth, of, the, brain, and, of, the, cortex, and, for, understanding, disease, development, offering, further, implications, for, therapeutic, applications, functional, neuroimaging, techniques, show, changes, in, brain, activity, that, relate, to, the, function, of, specific, brain, areas, one, technique, is, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, fmri, which, has, the, advantages, over, earlier, methods, of, spect, and, pet, of, not, needing, the, use, of, radioactive, materials, and, of, offering, a, higher, resolution, another, technique, is, functional, near, infrared, spectroscopy, these, methods, rely, on, the, haemodynamic, response, that, shows, changes, in, brain, activity, in, relation, to, changes, in, blood, flow, useful, in, mapping, functions, to, brain, areas, resting, state, fmri, looks, at, the, interaction, of, brain, regions, whilst, the, brain, is, not, performing, a, specific, task, this, is, also, used, to, show, the, default, mode, network, any, electrical, current, generates, a, magnetic, field, neural, oscillations, induce, weak, magnetic, fields, and, in, functional,

tracts, of, the, brain, connectograms, give, a, graphical, representation, of, the, neural, connections, of, the, brain, differences, in, brain, structure, can, be, measured, in, some, disorders, notably, schizophrenia, and, dementia, different, biological, approaches, using, imaging, have, given, more, insight, for, example, into, the, disorders, of, depression, and, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, a, key, source, of, information, about, the, function, of, brain, regions, is, the, effects, of, damage, to, them, advances, in, neuroimaging, have, enabled, objective, insights, into, mental, disorders, leading, to, faster, diagnosis, more, accurate, prognosis, and, better, monitoring, bioinformatics, is, a, field, of, study, that, includes, the, creation, and, advancement, of, databases, and, computational, and, statistical, techniques, that, can, be, used, in, studies, of, the, human, brain, particularly, in, the, areas, of, gene, and, protein, expression, bioinformatics, and, studies, in, genomics, and, functional, genomics, generated, the, need, for, dna, annotation, a, transcriptome, technology, identifying, genes, their, locations, and, functions, genecards, is, a, major, database, as, of, 2017, just, under, 20, 000, protein, coding, genes, are, seen, to, be, expressed, in, the, human, and, some, 400, of, these, genes, are, brain, specific, the, data, that, has, been, provided, on, gene, expression, in, the, brain, has, fuelled, further, research, into, a, number, of, disorders, the, long, term, use, of, alcohol, for, example, has, shown, altered, gene, expression, in, the, brain, and, cell, type, specific, changes, that, may, relate, to, alcohol, use, disorder, these, changes, have, been, noted, in, the, synaptic, transcriptome, in, the, prefrontal, cortex, and, are, seen, as, a, factor, causing, the, drive, to, alcohol, dependence, and, also, to, other, substance, abuses, other, related, studies, have, also, shown, evidence, of, synaptic, alterations, and, their, loss, in, the, ageing, brain, changes, in, gene, expression, alter, the, levels, of, proteins, in, various, neural, pathways, and, this, has, been, shown, to, be, evident, in, synaptic, contact, dysfunction, or, loss, this, dysfunction, has, been, seen, to, affect, many, structures, of, the, brain, and, has, a, marked, effect, on, inhibitory, neurons, resulting, in, a, decreased, level, of, neurotransmission, and, subsequent, cognitive, decline, and, disease, injury, to, the, brain, can, manifest, in, many, ways, traumatic, brain, injury, for, example, received, in, contact, sport, after, a, fall, or, a, traffic, or, work, accident, can, be, associated, with, both, immediate, and, longer, term, problems, immediate, problems, may, include, bleeding, within, the, brain, this, may, compress, the, brain, tissue, or, damage, its, blood, supply, bruising, to, the, brain, may, occur, bruising, may, cause, widespread, damage, to, the, nerve, tracts, that, can, lead, to, a, condition, of, diffuse, axonal, injury, a, fractured, skull, injury, to, a, particular, area, deafness, and, concussion, are, also, possible, immediate, developments, in, addition, to, the, site, of, injury, the, opposite, side, of, the, brain, may, be, affected, termed, a, contrecoup, injury, longer, term, issues, that, may, develop, include, posttraumatic, stress, disorder, and, hydrocephalus, chronic, traumatic, encephalopathy, can, develop, following, multiple, head, injuries, neurodegenerative, diseases, result, in, progressive, damage, to, or, loss, of, neurons, affecting, different, functions, of, the, brain, that, worsen, with, age, common, types, are, dementias, including, alzheimer, s, disease, alcoholic, dementia, vascular, dementia, and, parkinson, s, disease, dementia, other, rarer, infectious, genetic, or, metabolic, types, include, huntington, s, disease, motor, neuron, diseases, hiv, dementia, syphilis, related, dementia, and, wilson, s, disease, neurodegenerative, diseases, can, affect, different, parts, of, the, brain, and, can, affect, movement, memory, and, cognition, rare, prion, diseases, including, creutzfeldt, jakob, disease, and, its, variant, and, kuru, are, fatal, neurodegenerative, dieases, cerebral, atherosclerosis, is, atherosclerosis, that, affects, the, brain, it, results, from, the, build, up, of, plaques, formed, of, cholesterol, in, the, large, arteries, of, the, brain, and, can, be, mild, to, significant, when, significant, arteries, can, become, narrowed, enough, to, reduce, blood, flow, it, contributes, to, the, development, of, dementia, and, has, protein, similarities, to, those, found, in, alzheimer, s, disease, the, brain, although, protected, by, the, blood, brain, barrier, can, be, affected, by, infections, including, viruses, bacteria, and, fungi, infection, may, be, of, the, meninges, meningitis, the, brain, matter, encephalitis, or, within, the, brain, matter, such, as, a, cerebral, abscess, brain, tumours, can, be, either, benign, or, cancerous, most, malignant, tumours, arise, from, another, part, of, the, body, most, commonly, from, the, lung, breast, and, skin, cancers, of, brain, tissue, can, also, occur, and, originate, from, any, tissue, in, and, around, the, brain, meningioma, cancer, of, the, meninges, around, the, brain, is, more, common, than, cancers, of, brain, tissue, cancers, within, the, brain, may, cause, symptoms, related, to, their, size, or, position, with, symptoms, including, headache, and, nausea, or, the, gradual, development, of, focal, symptoms, such, as, gradual, difficulty, seeing, swallowing, talking, or, as, a, change, of, mood, cancers, are, in, general, investigated, through, the, use, of, ct, scans, and, mri, scans, a, variety, of, other, tests, including, blood, tests, and, lumbar, puncture, may, be, used, to, investigate, for, the, cause, of, the, cancer, and, evaluate, the, type, and, stage, of, the, cancer, the, corticosteroid, dexamethasone, is, often, given, to, decrease, the, swelling, of, brain, tissue, around, a, tumour, surgery, may, be, considered, however, given, the, complex, nature, of, many, tumours, or, based, on, tumour, stage, or, type, radiotherapy, or, chemotherapy, may, be, considered, more, suitable, mental, disorders, such, as, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar, disorder, posttraumatic, stress, disorder, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, tourette, syndrome, and, addiction, are, known, to, relate, to, the, functioning, of, the, brain, treatment, for, mental, disorders, may, include, psychotherapy, psychiatry, social, intervention, and, personal, recovery, work, or, cognitive, behavioural, therapy, the, underlying, issues, and, associated, prognoses, vary, significantly, between, individuals, epileptic, seizures, are, thought, to, relate, to, abnormal, electrical, activity, seizure, activity, can, manifest, as, absence, of, consciousness, focal, effects, such, as, limb, movement, or, impediments, of, speech, or, be, generalized, in, nature, status, epilepticus, refers, to, a, seizure, or, series, of, seizures, that, have, not, terminated, within, five, minutes, seizures, have, a, large, number, of, causes, however, many, seizures, occur, without, a, definitive, cause, being, found, in, a, person, with, epilepsy, risk, factors, for, further, seizures, may, include, sleeplessness, drug, and, alcohol, intake, and, stress, seizures, may, be, assessed, using, blood, tests, eeg, and, various, medical, imaging, techniques, based, on, the, medical, history, and, medical, examination, findings, in, addition, to, treating, an, underlying, cause, and, reducing, exposure, to, risk, factors, anticonvulsant, medications, can, play, a, role, in, preventing, further, seizures, some, brain, disorders, such, as, tay, sachs, disease, are, congenital, and, linked, to, genetic, and, chromosomal, mutations, a, rare, group, of, congenital, cephalic, disorders, known, as, lissencephaly, is, characterised, by, the, lack, of, or, inadequacy, of, cortical, folding, normal, development, of, the, brain, can, be, affected, during, pregnancy, by, nutritional, deficiencies, teratogens, infectious, diseases, and, by, the, use, of, recreational, drugs, including, alcohol, which, may, result, in, fetal, alcohol, spectrum, disorders, most, cerebral, arteriovenous, malformations, are, congenital, these, tangled, networks, of, blood, vessels, may, remain, without, symptoms, but, at, their, worst, may, rupture, and, cause, intracranial, hemorrhaging, a, stroke, is, a, decrease, in, blood, supply, to, an, area, of, the, brain, causing, cell, death, and, brain, injury, this, can, lead, to, a, wide, range, of, symptoms, including, the, fast, symptoms, of, facial, droop, arm, weakness, and, speech, difficulties, including, with, speaking, and, finding, words, or, forming, sentences, symptoms, relate, to, the, function, of, the, affected, area, of, the, brain, and, can, point, to, the, likely, site, and, cause, of, the, stroke, difficulties, with, movement, speech, or, sight, usually, relate, to, the, cerebrum, whereas, imbalance, double, vision, vertigo, and, symptoms, affecting, more, than, one, side, of, the, body, usually, relate, to, the, brainstem, or, cerebellum, most, strokes, result, from, loss, of, blood, supply, typically, because, of, an, embolus, rupture, of, a, fatty, plaque, causing, thrombus, or, narrowing, of, small, arteries, strokes, can, also, result, from, bleeding, within, the, brain, transient, ischaemic, attacks, tias, are, strokes, in, which, symptoms, resolve, within, 24, hours, investigation, into, the, stroke, will, involve, a, medical, examination, including, a, neurological, examination, and, the, taking, of, a, medical, history, focusing, on, the, duration, of, the, symptoms, and, risk, factors, including, high, blood, pressure, atrial, fibrillation, and, smoking, further, investigation, is, needed, in, younger, patients, an, ecg, and, biotelemetry, may, be, conducted, to, identify, atrial, fibrillation, an, ultrasound, can, investigate, narrowing, of, the, carotid, arteries, an, echocardiogram, can, be, used, to, look, for, clots, within, the, heart, diseases, of, the, heart, valves, or, the, presence, of, a, patent, foramen, ovale, blood, tests, are, routinely, done, as, part, of, the, workup, including, diabetes, tests, and, a, lipid, profile, some, treatments, for, stroke, are, time, critical, these, include, clot, dissolution, or, surgical, removal, of, a, clot, for, ischaemic, strokes, and, decompression, for, haemorrhagic, strokes, as, stroke, is, time, critical, hospitals, and, even, pre, hospital, care, of, stroke, involves, expedited, investigations, usually, a, ct, scan, to, investigate, for, a, haemorrhagic, stroke, and, a, ct, or, mr, angiogram, to, evaluate, arteries, that, supply, the, brain, mri, scans, not, as, widely, available, may, be, able, to, demonstrate, the, affected, area, of, the, brain, more, accurately, particularly, with, ischaemic, stroke, having, experienced, a, stroke, a, person, may, be, admitted, to, a, stroke, unit, and, treatments, may, be, directed, as, preventing, future, strokes, including, ongoing, anticoagulation, such, as, aspirin, or, clopidogrel, antihypertensives, and, lipid, lowering, drugs, a, multidisciplinary, team, including, speech, pathologists, physiotherapists, occupational, therapists, and, psychologists, plays, a, large, role, in, supporting, a, person, affected, by, a, stroke, and, their, rehabilitation, a, history, of, stroke, increases, the, risk, of, developing, dementia, by, around, 70, and, recent, stroke, increases, the, risk, by, around, 120, brain, death, refers, to, an, irreversible, total, loss, of, brain, function, this, is, characterised, by, coma, loss, of, reflexes, and, apnoea, however, the, declaration, of, brain, death, varies, geographically, and, is, not, always, accepted, in, some, countries, there, is, also, a, defined, syndrome, of, brainstem, death, declaration, of, brain, death, can, have, profound, implications, as, the, declaration, under, the, principle, of, medical, futility, will, be, associated, with, the, withdrawal, of, life, support, and, as, those, with, brain, death, often, have, organs, suitable, for, organ, donation, the, process, is, often, made, more, difficult, by, poor, communication, with, patients, families, when, brain, death, is, suspected, reversible, differential, diagnoses, such, as, electrolyte, neurological, and, drug, related, cognitive, suppression, need, to, be, excluded, testing, for, reflexes, can, be, of, help, in, the, decision, as, can, the, absence, of, response, and, breathing, clinical, observations, including, a, total, lack, of, responsiveness, a, known, diagnosis, and, neural, imaging, evidence, may, all, play, a, role, in, the, decision, to, pronounce, brain, death, neuroanthropology, is, the, study, of, the, relationship, between, culture, and, the, brain, it, explores, how, the, brain, gives, rise, to, culture, and, how, culture, influences, brain, development, cultural, differences, and, their, relation, to, brain, development, and, structure, are, researched, in, different, fields, the, philosophy, of, the, mind, studies, such, issues, as, the, problem, of, understanding, consciousness, and, the, mind, body, problem, the, relationship, between, the, brain, and, the, mind, is, a, significant, challenge, both, philosophically, and, scientifically, this, is, because, of, the, difficulty, in, explaining, how, mental, activities, such, as, thoughts, and, emotions, can, be, implemented, by, physical, structures, such, as, neurons, and, synapses, or, by, any, other, type, of, physical, mechanism, this, difficulty, was, expressed, by, gottfried, leibniz, in, the, analogy, known, as, leibniz, s, mill, one, is, obliged, to, admit, that, perception, and, what, depends, upon, it, is, inexplicable, on, mechanical, principles, that, is, by, figures, and, motions, in, imagining, that, there, is, a, machine, whose, construction, would, enable, it, to, think, to, sense, and, to, have, perception, one, could, conceive, it, enlarged, while, retaining, the, same, proportions, so, that, one, could, enter, into, it, just, like, into, a, windmill, supposing, this, one, should, when, visiting, within, it, find, only, parts, pushing, one, another, and, never, anything, by, which, to, explain, a, perception, doubt, about, the, possibility, of, a, mechanistic, explanation, of, thought, drove, ren, descartes, and, most, other, philosophers, along, with, him, to, dualism, the, belief, that, the, mind, is, to, some, degree, independent, of, the, brain, there, has, always, however, been, a, strong, argument, in, the, opposite, direction, there, is, clear, empirical, evidence, that, physical, manipulations, of, or, injuries, to, the, brain, for, example, by, drugs, or, by, lesions, respectively, can, affect, the, mind, in, potent, and, intimate, ways, in, the, 19th, century, the, case, of, phineas, gage, a, railway, worker, who, was, injured, by, a, stout, iron, rod, passing, through, his, brain, convinced, both, researchers, and, the, public, that, cognitive, functions, were, localised, in, the, brain, following, this, line, of, thinking, a, large, body, of, empirical, evidence, for, a, close, relationship, between, brain, activity, and, mental, activity, has, led, most, neuroscientists, and, contemporary, philosophers, to, be, materialists, believing, that, mental, phenomena, are, ultimately, the, result, of, or, reducible, to, physical, phenomena, the, size, of, the, brain, and, a, person, s, intelligence, are, not, strongly, related, studies, tend, to, indicate, small, to, moderate, correlations, averaging, around, 0, 3, to, 0, 4, between, brain, volume, and, iq, the, most, consistent, associations, are, observed, within, the, frontal, temporal, and, parietal, lobes, the, hippocampi, and, the, cerebellum, but, these, only, account, for, a, relatively, small, amount, of, variance, in, iq, which, itself, has, only, a, partial, relationship, to, general, intelligence, and, real, world, performance, other, animals, including, whales, and, elephants, have, larger, brains, than, humans, however, when, the, brain, to, body, mass, ratio, is, taken, into, account, the, human, brain, is, almost, twice, as, large, as, that, of, a, bottlenose, dolphin, and, three, times, as, large, as, that, of, a, chimpanzee, however, a, high, ratio, does, not, of, itself, demonstrate, intelligence, very, small, animals, have, high, ratios, and, the, treeshrew, has, the, largest, quotient, of, any, mammal, earlier, ideas, about, the, relative, importance, of, the, different, organs, of, the, human, body, sometimes, emphasised, the, heart, modern, western, popular, conceptions, in, contrast, have, placed, increasing, focus, on, the, brain, research, has, disproved, some, common, misconceptions, about, the, brain, these, include, both, ancient, and, modern, myths, it, is, not, true, for, example, that, neurons, are, not, replaced, after, the, age, of, two, nor, that, normal, humans, use, only, ten, per, cent, of, the, brain, popular, culture, has, also, oversimplified, the, lateralisation, of, the, brain, by, suggesting, that, functions, are, completely, specific, to, one, side, of, the, brain, or, the, other, akio, mori, coined, the, term, game, brain, for, the, unreliably, supported, theory, that, spending, long, periods, playing, video, games, harmed, the, brain, s, pre, frontal, region, and, impaired, the, expression, of, emotion, and, creativity, historically, particularly, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, brain, featured, in, popular, culture, through, phrenology, a, pseudoscience, that, assigned, personality, attributes, to, different, regions, of, the, cortex, the, cortex, remains, important, in, popular, culture, as, covered, in, books, and, satire, the, human, brain, can, feature, in, science, fiction, with, themes, such, as, brain, transplants, and, cyborgs, beings, with, features, like, partly, artificial, brains, the, 1942, science, fiction, book, adapted, three, times, for, the, cinema, donovan, s, brain, tells, the, tale, of, an, isolated, brain, kept, alive, in, vitro, gradually, taking, over, the, personality, of, the, book, s, protagonist, the, edwin, smith, papyrus, an, ancient, egyptian, medical, treatise, written, in, the, 17th, century, bc, contains, the, earliest, recorded, reference, to, the, brain, the, hieroglyph, for, brain, occurring, eight, times, in, this, papyrus, describes, the, symptoms, diagnosis, and, prognosis, of, two, traumatic, injuries, to, the, head, the, papyrus, mentions, the, external, surface, of, the, brain, the, effects, of, injury, including, seizures, and, aphasia, the, meninges, and, cerebrospinal, fluid, in, the, fifth, century, bc, alcmaeon, of, croton, in, magna, grecia, first, considered, the, brain, to, be, the, seat, of, the, mind, also, in, the, fifth, century, bc, in, athens, the, unknown, author, of, on, the, sacred, disease, a, medical, treatise, which, is, part, of, the, hippocratic, corpus, and, traditionally, attributed, to, hippocrates, believed, the, brain, to, be, the, seat, of, intelligence, aristotle, in, his, biology, initially, believed, the, heart, to, be, the, seat, of, intelligence, and, saw, the, brain, as, a, cooling, mechanism, for, the, blood, he, reasoned, that, humans, are, more, rational, than, the, beasts, because, among, other, reasons, they, have, a, larger, brain, to, cool, their, hot, bloodedness, aristotle, did, describe, the, meninges, and, distinguished, between, the, cerebrum, and, cerebellum, herophilus, of, chalcedon, in, the, fourth, and, third, centuries, bc, distinguished, the, cerebrum, and, the, cerebellum, and, provided, the, first, clear, description, of, the, ventricles, and, with, erasistratus, of, ceos, experimented, on, living, brains, their, works, are, now, mostly, lost, and, we, know, about, their, achievements, due, mostly, to, secondary, sources, some, of, their, discoveries, had, to, be, re, discovered, a, millennium, after, their, deaths, anatomist, physician, galen, in, the, second, century, ad, during, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, dissected, the, brains, of, sheep, monkeys, dogs, and, pigs, he, concluded, that, as, the, cerebellum, was, denser, than, the, brain, it, must, control, the, muscles, while, as, the, cerebrum, was, soft, it, must, be, where, the, senses, were, processed, galen, further, theorised, that, the, brain, functioned, by, movement, of, animal, spirits, through, the, ventricles, in, 1316, mondino, de, luzzi, s, anathomia, began, the, modern, study, of, brain, anatomy, niccol, massa, discovered, in, 1536, that, the, ventricles, were, filled, with, fluid, archangelo, piccolomini, of, rome, was, the, first, to, distinguish, between, the, cerebrum, and, cerebral, cortex, in, 1543, andreas, vesalius, published, his, seven, volume, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, the, seventh, book, covered, the, brain, and, eye, with, detailed, images, of, the, ventricles, cranial, nerves, pituitary, gland, meninges, structures, of, the, eye, the, vascular, supply, to, the, brain, and, spinal, cord, and, an, image, of, the, peripheral, nerves, vesalius, rejected, the, common, belief, that, the, ventricles, were, responsible, for, brain, function, arguing, that, many, animals, have, a, similar, ventricular, system, to, humans, but, no, true, intelligence, ren, descartes, proposed, the, theory, of, dualism, to, tackle, the, issue, of, the, brain, s, relation, to, the, mind, he, suggested, that, the, pineal, gland, was, where, the, mind, interacted, with, the, body, serving, as, the, seat, of, the, soul, and, as, the, connection, through, which, animal, spirits, passed, from, the, blood, into, the, brain, this, dualism, likely, provided, impetus, for, later, anatomists, to, further, explore, the, relationship, between, the, anatomical, and, functional, aspects, of, brain, anatomy, thomas, willis, is, considered, a, second, pioneer, in, the, study, of, neurology, and, brain, science, he, wrote, cerebri, anatome, latin, anatomy, of, the, brain, in, 1664, followed, by, cerebral, pathology, in, 1667, in, these, he, described, the, structure, of, the, cerebellum, the, ventricles, the, cerebral, hemispheres, the, brainstem, and, the, cranial, nerves, studied, its, blood, supply, and, proposed, functions, associated, with, different, areas, of, the, brain, the, circle, of, willis, was, named, after, his, investigations, into, the, blood, supply, of, the, brain, and, he, was, the, first, to, use, the, word, neurology, willis, removed, the, brain, from, the, body, when, examining, it, and, rejected, the, commonly, held, view, that, the, cortex, only, consisted, of, blood, vessels, and, the, view, of, the, last, two, millennia, that, the, cortex, was, only, incidentally, important, in, the, middle, of, 19th, century, emil, du, bois, reymond, and, hermann, von, helmholtz, were, able, to, use, a, galvanometer, to, show, that, electrical, impulses, passed, at, measurable, speeds, along, nerves, refuting, the, view, of, their, teacher, johannes, peter, m, ller, that, the, nerve, impulse, was, a, vital, function, that, could, not, be, measured, richard, caton, in, 1875, demonstrated, electrical, impulses, in, the, cerebral, hemispheres, of, rabbits, and, monkeys, in, the, 1820s, jean, pierre, flourens, pioneered, the, experimental, method, of, damaging, specific, parts, of, animal, brains, describing, the, effects, on, movement, and, behavior, studies, of, the, brain, became, more, sophisticated, with, the, use, of, the, microscope, and, the, development, of, a, silver, staining, method, by, camillo, golgi, during, the, 1880s, this, was, able, to, show, the, intricate, structures, of, single, neurons, this, was, used, by, santiago, ram, n, y, cajal, and, led, to, the, formation, of, the, neuron, doctrine, the, then, revolutionary, hypothesis, that, the, neuron, is, the, functional, unit, of, the, brain, he, used, microscopy, to, uncover, many, cell, types, and, proposed, functions, for, the, cells, he, saw, for, this, golgi, and, cajal, are, considered, the, founders, of, twentieth, century, neuroscience, both, sharing, the, nobel, prize, in, 1906, for, their, studies, and, discoveries, in, this, field, charles, sherrington, published, his, influential, 1906, work, the, integrative, action, of, the, nervous, system, examining, the, function, of, reflexes, evolutionary, development, of, the, nervous, system, functional, specialisation, of, the, brain, and, layout, and, cellular, function, of, the, central, nervous, system, in, 1942, he, coined, the, term, enchanted, loom, as, a, metaphor, for, the, brain, john, farquhar, fulton, founded, the, journal, of, neurophysiology, and, published, the, first, comprehensive, textbook, on, the, physiology, of, the, nervous, system, during, 1938, neuroscience, during, the, twentieth, century, began, to, be, recognised, as, a, distinct, unified, academic, discipline, with, david, rioch, francis, o, schmitt, and, stephen, kuffler, playing, critical, roles, in, establishing, the, field, rioch, originated, the, integration, of, basic, anatomical, and, physiological, research, with, clinical, psychiatry, at, the, walter, reed, army, institute, of, research, starting, in, the, 1950s, during, the, same, period, schmitt, established, the, neuroscience, research, program, an, inter, university, and, international, organisation, bringing, together, biology, medicine, psychological, and, behavioural, sciences, the, word, neuroscience, itself, arises, from, this, program, paul, broca, associated, regions, of, the, brain, with, specific, functions, in, particular, language, in, broca, s, area, following, work, on, brain, damaged, patients, john, hughlings, jackson, described, the, function, of, the, motor, cortex, by, watching, the, progression, of, epileptic, seizures, through, the, body, carl, wernicke, described, a, region, associated, with, language, comprehension, and, production, korbinian, brodmann, divided, regions, of, the, brain, based, on, the, appearance, of, cells, by, 1950, sherrington, papez, and, maclean, had, identified, many, of, the, brainstem, and, limbic, system, functions, the, capacity, of, the, brain, to, re, organise, and, change, with, age, and, a, recognised, critical, development, period, were, attributed, to, neuroplasticity, pioneered, by, margaret, kennard, who, experimented, on, monkeys, during, the, 1930, 40s, harvey, cushing, 1869, 1939, is, recognised, as, the, first, proficient, brain, surgeon, in, the, world, in, 1937, walter, dandy, began, the, practice, of, vascular, neurosurgery, by, performing, the, first, surgical, clipping, of, an, intracranial, aneurysm, the, human, brain, has, many, properties, that, are, common, to, all, vertebrate, brains, many, of, its, features, are, common, to, all, mammalian, brains, most, notably, a, six, layered, cerebral, cortex, and, a, set, of, associated, structures, including, the, hippocampus, and, amygdala, the, cortex, is, proportionally, larger, in, humans, than, in, many, other, mammals, humans, have, more, association, cortex, sensory, and, motor, parts, than, smaller, mammals, such, as, the, rat, and, the, cat, as, a, primate, brain, the, human, brain, has, a, much, larger, cerebral, cortex, in, proportion, to, body, size, than, most, mammals, and, a, highly, developed, visual, system, as, a, hominid, brain, the, human, brain, is, substantially, enlarged, even, in, comparison, to, the, brain, of, a, typical, monkey, the, sequence, of, human, evolution, from, australopithecus, four, million, years, ago, to, homo, sapiens, modern, humans, was, marked, by, a, steady, increase, in, brain, size, as, brain, size, increased, this, altered, the, size, and, shape, of, the, skull, from, about, 600, cm, 3, in, homo, habilis, to, an, average, of, about, 1520, cm, 3, in, homo, neanderthalensis, differences, in, dna, gene, expression, and, gene, environment, interactions, help, explain, the, differences, between, the, function, of, the, human, brain, and, other, primates, ocular, group, central, retinal, 2, spinomesencephalic, tract, superior, colliculus, of, midbrain, tectum
