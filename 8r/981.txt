about, 187, see, text, camellia, pronounced, k, m, l, i, or, k, m, i, l, i, is, a, genus, of, flowering, plants, in, the, family, theaceae, they, are, found, in, tropical, and, subtropical, areas, in, eastern, and, southern, asia, from, the, himalayas, east, to, japan, and, indonesia, there, are, more, than, 220, described, species, camellias, are, popular, ornamental, tea, and, woody, oil, plants, cultivated, worldwide, for, centuries, over, 26, 000, cultivars, with, more, than, 51, 000, cultivar, names, including, synonyms, have, been, registered, or, published, of, economic, importance, in, east, asia, southeast, asia, and, the, indian, subcontinent, leaves, of, c, sinensis, are, processed, to, create, the, popular, beverage, tea, the, ornamental, c, japonica, c, sasanqua, and, their, hybrids, are, the, source, of, hundreds, of, garden, cultivars, c, oleifera, produces, tea, seed, oil, used, in, cooking, and, cosmetics, the, genus, was, named, by, linnaeus, after, the, jesuit, botanist, georg, joseph, kamel, who, worked, in, the, philippines, and, described, one, of, its, species, although, linnaeus, did, not, refer, to, kamel, s, account, when, discussing, the, genus, 246, 255, camellias, are, evergreen, shrubs, or, small, trees, up, to, 20, m, 66, ft, tall, their, leaves, are, alternately, arranged, simple, thick, serrated, and, usually, glossy, their, flowers, are, usually, large, and, conspicuous, one, to, 12, cm, in, diameter, with, five, to, nine, petals, in, naturally, occurring, species, of, camellias, the, colors, of, the, flowers, vary, from, white, through, pink, colors, to, red, truly, yellow, flowers, are, found, only, in, south, china, and, vietnam, tea, varieties, are, always, white, flowered, camellia, flowers, throughout, the, genus, are, characterized, by, a, dense, bouquet, of, conspicuous, yellow, stamens, often, contrasting, with, the, petal, colors, some, research, has, shown, that, the, colour, of, petals, in, some, species, flowers, indicate, their, size, and, how, they, are, pollinated, species, with, red, or, yellow, flowers, are, pollinated, by, sunbirds, whereas, species, with, white, flowers, are, smaller, in, diameter, and, are, pollinated, by, bees, 3, 4, the, fruit, of, camellia, plants, is, a, dry, capsule, sometimes, subdivided, into, up, to, five, compartments, each, compartment, contains, up, to, eight, seeds, the, various, species, of, camellia, plants, are, generally, well, adapted, to, acid, soils, rich, in, humus, and, most, species, do, not, grow, well, on, chalky, soil, or, other, calcium, rich, soils, most, species, of, camellias, also, require, a, large, amount, of, water, either, from, natural, rainfall, or, from, irrigation, and, the, plants, will, not, tolerate, droughts, however, some, of, the, more, unusual, camellias, typically, species, from, karst, soils, in, vietnam, can, grow, without, too, much, water, camellia, plants, usually, have, a, rapid, growth, rate, typically, they, will, grow, about, 30, cm, per, year, until, mature, however, this, varies, depending, on, their, variety, and, geographical, location, camellia, plants, are, used, as, food, plants, by, the, larvae, of, some, lepidoptera, species, leaves, of, camellia, japonica, are, susceptible, to, the, fungal, parasite, mycelia, sterile, see, below, for, the, significance, mycelia, sterile, pf1022, produces, a, metabolite, named, pf1022a, that, is, used, to, produce, emodepside, an, anthelmintic, drug, due, to, habitat, destruction, several, camellias, have, become, rare, in, their, natural, range, one, of, these, is, the, aforementioned, c, reticulata, grown, commercially, in, thousands, for, horticulture, and, oil, production, but, rare, enough, in, its, natural, range, to, be, considered, a, threatened, species, camellia, sinensis, the, tea, plant, is, of, major, commercial, importance, because, tea, is, made, from, its, leaves, the, species, c, sinensis, is, the, product, of, many, generations, of, selective, breeding, to, bring, out, desirable, qualities, for, tea, however, many, other, camellias, can, be, used, to, produce, a, similar, beverage, for, example, tea, made, from, c, sasanqua, leaves, is, popular, in, some, parts, of, japan, seeds, of, c, oleifera, c, japonica, and, to, a, lesser, extent, other, species, such, as, c, crapnelliana, c, reticulata, c, sasanqua, and, c, sinensis, as, well, are, pressed, to, make, tea, seed, oil, a, sweet, seasoning, and, cooking, oil, special, to, east, asia, it, is, the, most, important, cooking, oil, for, hundreds, of, millions, of, people, particularly, in, southern, china, camellia, oil, is, commonly, used, to, clean, and, protect, the, blades, of, cutting, instruments, camellia, oil, pressed, from, seeds, of, c, japonica, also, called, tsubaki, oil, or, tsubaki, abura, in, japanese, has, been, traditionally, used, in, japan, for, hair, care, c, japonica, plant, is, used, to, prepare, traditional, antiinflammatory, medicines, the, earliest, fossil, record, of, camellia, are, the, leaves, of, c, abensis, from, the, upper, eocene, of, japan, c, abchasica, from, the, lower, oligocene, of, bulgaria, and, c, multiforma, from, the, lower, oligocene, of, washington, united, states, camellias, were, cultivated, in, the, gardens, of, china, for, centuries, before, they, were, seen, in, europe, the, german, botanist, engelbert, kaempfer, reported, that, the, japan, rose, as, he, called, it, grew, wild, in, woodland, and, hedgerow, but, that, many, superior, varieties, had, been, selected, for, gardens, europeans, earliest, views, of, camellias, must, have, been, their, representations, in, chinese, painted, wallpapers, where, they, were, often, represented, growing, in, porcelain, pots, the, first, living, camellias, seen, in, england, were, a, single, red, and, a, single, white, grown, and, flowered, in, his, garden, at, thorndon, hall, essex, by, robert, james, lord, petre, among, the, keenest, gardeners, of, his, generation, in, 1739, his, gardener, james, gordon, was, the, first, to, introduce, camellias, to, commerce, from, the, nurseries, he, established, after, lord, petre, s, untimely, death, in, 1743, at, mile, end, essex, near, london, with, the, expansion, of, the, tea, trade, in, the, later, 18th, century, new, varieties, began, to, be, seen, in, england, imported, through, the, british, east, india, company, the, company, s, john, slater, was, responsible, for, the, first, of, the, new, camellias, double, ones, in, white, and, a, striped, red, imported, in, 1792, further, camellias, imported, in, the, east, indiamen, were, associated, with, the, patrons, whose, gardeners, grew, them, a, double, red, for, sir, robert, preston, in, 1794, and, the, pale, pink, named, lady, hume, s, blush, for, amelia, the, lady, of, sir, abraham, hume, of, wormleybury, hertfordshire, 1806, the, camellia, was, imported, from, england, to, america, in, 1797, when, colonel, john, stevens, brought, the, flower, as, part, of, an, effort, to, grow, attractions, within, elysian, fields, in, hoboken, new, jersey, by, 1819, twenty, five, camellias, had, bloomed, in, england, that, year, the, first, monograph, appeared, samuel, curtis, s, a, monograph, on, the, genus, camellia, whose, five, handsome, folio, colored, illustrations, have, usually, been, removed, from, the, slender, text, and, framed, though, they, did, not, flower, for, over, a, decade, camellias, that, set, seed, rewarded, their, growers, with, a, wealth, of, new, varieties, by, the, 1840s, the, camellia, was, at, the, height, of, its, fashion, as, the, luxury, flower, the, parisian, courtesan, marie, duplessis, who, died, young, in, 1847, inspired, dumas, la, dame, aux, cam, lias, and, verdi, s, la, traviata, the, fashionable, imbricated, formality, of, prized, camellias, was, an, element, in, their, decline, replaced, by, the, new, hothouse, orchid, their, revival, after, world, war, i, as, woodland, shrubs, for, mild, climates, has, been, paralleled, by, the, rise, in, popularity, of, camellia, sasanqua, the, tea, camellia, c, sinensis, has, been, selected, by, many, commercial, cultivars, for, the, taste, of, its, leaves, once, processed, into, tea, leaves, today, camellias, are, grown, as, ornamental, plants, for, their, flowers, about, 3, 000, cultivars, and, hybrids, have, been, selected, many, with, double, or, semi, double, flowers, c, japonica, is, the, most, prominent, species, in, cultivation, with, over, 2, 000, named, cultivars, next, are, c, reticulata, with, over, 400, named, cultivars, and, c, sasanqua, with, over, 300, named, cultivars, popular, hybrids, include, c, hiemalis, c, japonica, c, sasanqua, and, c, williamsii, c, japonica, c, saluenensis, some, varieties, can, grow, considerably, up, to, 100, m, 2, though, more, compact, cultivars, are, available, they, are, frequently, planted, in, woodland, settings, alongside, other, calcifuges, such, as, rhododendrons, they, are, particularly, associated, with, areas, of, high, soil, acidity, such, as, cornwall, and, devon, in, the, uk, they, are, highly, valued, for, their, very, early, flowering, often, among, the, first, flowers, to, appear, in, the, late, winter, late, frosts, can, damage, the, flower, buds, resulting, in, misshapen, flowers, there, is, a, great, variety, of, flower, forms, the, following, hybrid, cultivars, have, gained, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, award, of, garden, merit, plants, of, the, world, online, currently, includes, the, camellia, family, of, plants, in, popular, culture
