tobacco, products, especially, when, smoked, or, used, orally, have, serious, negative, effects, on, human, health, smoking, and, smokeless, tobacco, use, is, the, single, greatest, cause, of, preventable, death, globally, as, many, as, half, of, people, who, smoke, tobacco, or, use, it, orally, die, from, complications, related, to, such, use, it, has, been, estimated, that, each, year, in, total, about, 6, million, people, die, from, tobacco, related, causes, about, 10, of, all, deaths, with, 600, 000, of, these, occurring, in, non, smokers, due, to, secondhand, smoke, it, is, further, estimated, to, have, caused, 100, million, deaths, in, the, 20th, century, tobacco, smoke, contains, over, 70, chemicals, that, cause, cancer, it, also, contains, nicotine, a, highly, addictive, psychoactive, drug, when, tobacco, is, smoked, the, nicotine, in, it, causes, physical, and, psychological, dependency, cigarettes, sold, in, underdeveloped, countries, have, higher, tar, content, they, are, less, likely, to, be, filtered, increasing, vulnerability, to, tobacco, smoking, related, diseases, in, these, regions, tobacco, use, most, commonly, leads, to, diseases, affecting, the, heart, liver, and, lungs, smoking, is, a, major, risk, factor, for, several, conditions, namely, pneumonia, heart, attacks, strokes, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, including, emphysema, and, chronic, bronchitis, and, multiple, cancers, particularly, lung, cancer, cancers, of, the, larynx, and, mouth, bladder, cancer, and, pancreatic, cancer, it, is, also, responsible, for, peripheral, arterial, disease, and, high, blood, pressure, the, effects, vary, depending, on, how, frequently, and, for, how, many, years, a, person, smokes, smoking, earlier, in, life, and, smoking, cigarettes, higher, in, tar, increase, the, risk, of, these, diseases, additionally, environmental, tobacco, smoke, or, second, hand, smoke, has, manifested, harmful, health, effects, in, people, of, all, ages, tobacco, use, is, also, a, significant, factor, in, miscarriages, among, pregnant, smokers, it, contributes, to, a, number, of, other, health, problems, of, the, fetus, such, as, premature, birth, low, birth, weight, and, increases, the, chance, of, sudden, infant, death, syndrome, sids, by, 1, 4, to, 3, times, incidence, of, erectile, dysfunction, is, approximately, 85, percent, higher, in, male, smokers, compared, to, non, smokers, many, countries, have, taken, measures, to, control, the, consumption, of, tobacco, smoking, by, restricting, its, usage, and, sales, on, top, of, that, they, have, printed, warning, messages, on, packaging, moreover, smoke, free, laws, that, ban, smoking, in, public, places, like, workplaces, theaters, bars, and, restaurants, have, been, enacted, to, reduce, exposure, to, second, hand, smoke, tobacco, taxes, inflating, the, price, of, tobacco, products, have, also, been, imposed, in, the, late, 1700s, and, the, 1800s, the, idea, that, tobacco, use, caused, certain, diseases, including, mouth, cancers, was, initially, accepted, by, the, medical, community, in, the, 1880s, automation, dramatically, reduced, the, cost, of, cigarettes, cigarette, companies, greatly, increased, their, marketing, and, use, expanded, from, the, 1890s, onwards, associations, of, tobacco, use, with, cancers, and, vascular, disease, were, regularly, reported, by, the, 1930s, multiple, researchers, concluded, that, tobacco, use, caused, cancer, and, tobacco, users, lived, substantially, shorter, lives, further, studies, were, published, in, nazi, germany, in, 1939, and, 1943, and, one, in, the, netherlands, in, 1948, however, the, widespread, attention, was, first, drawn, in, 1950, by, researchers, from, the, us, and, uk, but, their, research, were, widely, criticized, follow, up, studies, in, the, early, 1950s, found, that, smokers, died, faster, and, were, more, likely, to, die, of, lung, cancer, and, cardiovascular, disease, these, results, were, accepted, in, the, medical, community, and, publicized, among, the, general, public, in, the, mid, 1960s, see, also, multiple, infarct, dementia, vascular, diseases, smoking, most, commonly, leads, to, diseases, affecting, the, heart, and, lungs, and, will, commonly, affect, areas, such, as, hands, or, feet, first, signs, of, smoking, related, health, issues, often, show, up, as, numbness, in, the, extremities, with, smoking, being, a, major, risk, factor, for, heart, attacks, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, emphysema, and, cancer, particularly, lung, cancer, cancers, of, the, larynx, and, mouth, and, pancreatic, cancer, overall, life, expectancy, is, also, reduced, in, long, term, smokers, with, estimates, ranging, from, 10, to, 17, 9, years, fewer, than, nonsmokers, about, one, half, of, long, term, male, smokers, will, die, of, illness, due, to, smoking, the, association, of, smoking, with, lung, cancer, and, copd, are, among, strongest, both, in, the, public, perception, and, etiologically, among, male, smokers, the, lifetime, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, is, 17, 2, among, female, smokers, the, risk, is, 11, 6, this, risk, is, significantly, lower, in, nonsmokers, 1, 3, in, men, and, 1, 4, in, women, for, copd, the, 25, year, incidence, of, moderate, and, severe, copd, is, at, least, 20, 7, for, continuous, smokers, and, 3, 6, for, nonsmokers, with, no, difference, being, reported, between, men, and, women, a, person, s, increased, risk, of, contracting, disease, is, related, to, the, length, of, time, that, a, person, continues, to, smoke, as, well, as, the, amount, smoked, however, even, smoking, one, cigarette, a, day, raises, the, risk, of, coronary, heart, disease, by, about, 50, or, more, and, for, stroke, by, about, 30, smoking, 20, cigarettes, a, day, entails, a, higher, risk, but, not, proportionately, if, someone, stops, smoking, then, these, chances, gradually, decrease, as, the, damage, to, their, body, is, repaired, a, year, after, quitting, the, risk, of, contracting, heart, disease, is, half, that, of, a, continuing, smoker, the, health, risks, of, smoking, are, not, uniform, across, all, smokers, risks, vary, according, to, the, amount, of, tobacco, smoked, with, those, who, smoke, more, at, greater, risk, smoking, so, called, light, cigarettes, does, not, reduce, the, risk, smoking, is, the, cause, of, about, 5, million, deaths, per, year, this, makes, it, the, most, common, cause, of, preventable, early, death, one, study, found, that, male, and, female, smokers, lose, an, average, of, 13, 2, and, 14, 5, years, of, life, respectively, another, measured, a, loss, of, life, of, 6, 8, years, each, cigarette, that, is, smoked, is, estimated, to, shorten, life, by, an, average, of, 11, minutes, though, this, may, vary, slightly, on, the, contents, and, brand, at, least, half, of, all, lifelong, smokers, die, early, as, a, result, of, smoking, smokers, are, three, times, more, likely, to, die, before, the, age, of, 60, or, 70, than, non, smokers, in, the, united, states, cigarette, smoking, and, exposure, to, tobacco, smoke, accounts, for, roughly, one, in, five, or, at, least, 443, 000, premature, deaths, annually, to, put, this, into, context, abc, s, peter, jennings, who, would, later, die, at, 67, from, complications, of, lung, cancer, caused, by, life, long, smoking, famously, reported, that, in, the, us, alone, smoking, tobacco, kills, the, equivalent, of, three, jumbo, jets, full, of, people, crashing, every, day, with, no, survivors, on, a, worldwide, basis, this, equates, to, a, single, jumbo, jet, every, hour, a, 2015, study, found, that, about, 17, of, mortality, due, to, cigarette, smoking, in, the, united, states, is, due, to, diseases, outside, of, those, commonly, linked, with, smoking, and, that, official, estimates, may, therefore, be, significantly, underestimating, the, number, of, deaths, currently, being, attributed, to, smoking, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, between, 1, and, 1, 4, deaths, per, million, cigarettes, smoked, in, fact, cigarette, factories, are, the, most, deadly, factories, in, the, history, of, the, world, see, the, below, chart, detailing, the, highest, producing, cigarette, factories, and, their, estimated, deaths, caused, annually, due, to, the, health, detriments, of, cigarettes, according, to, who, 27137, annual, deaths, are, attributed, to, tobacco, use, in, nepal, the, primary, risks, of, tobacco, usage, include, many, forms, of, cancer, particularly, lung, cancer, kidney, cancer, cancer, of, the, larynx, and, head, and, neck, bladder, cancer, cancer, of, the, esophagus, cancer, of, the, pancreas, stomach, cancer, and, penile, cancer, tobacco, smoke, can, increase, the, risk, of, cervical, cancer, in, women, there, may, be, a, small, increased, risk, of, myeloid, leukemia, squamous, cell, sinonasal, cancer, liver, cancer, colorectal, cancer, cancers, of, the, gallbladder, the, adrenal, gland, the, small, intestine, and, various, childhood, cancers, the, possible, connection, between, breast, cancer, and, tobacco, is, still, uncertain, the, risk, of, lung, cancer, risk, is, highly, influenced, by, smoking, with, up, to, 90, of, diagnoses, being, attributed, to, tobacco, smoking, the, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, increases, with, the, number, of, years, smoking, and, number, of, cigarettes, smoked, per, day, smoking, can, be, linked, to, all, subtypes, of, lung, cancer, small, cell, carcinoma, sclc, is, the, most, closely, associated, with, almost, 100, of, cases, occurring, in, smokers, this, form, of, cancer, has, been, identified, with, autocrine, growth, loops, proto, oncogene, activation, and, inhibition, of, tumour, suppressor, genes, sclc, may, originate, from, neuroendocrine, cells, located, in, the, bronchus, called, feyrter, cells, the, risk, of, dying, from, lung, cancer, before, age, 85, is, 22, 1, for, a, male, smoker, and, 11, 9, for, a, female, smoker, in, the, absence, of, competing, causes, of, death, the, corresponding, estimates, for, lifelong, nonsmokers, are, a, 1, 1, probability, of, dying, from, lung, cancer, before, age, 85, for, a, man, of, european, descent, and, a, 0, 8, probability, for, a, woman, tobacco, smoking, is, one, of, the, main, risk, factors, for, head, and, neck, cancer, cigarette, smokers, have, a, lifetime, increased, risk, for, head, and, neck, cancer, that, is, 5, to, 25, times, higher, than, the, general, population, the, ex, smoker, s, risk, of, developing, head, and, neck, cancer, begins, to, approach, the, risk, in, the, general, population, 15, years, after, smoking, cessation, in, addition, people, who, smoke, have, a, worse, prognosis, than, those, who, have, never, smoked, furthermore, people, who, continue, to, smoke, after, diagnosis, of, head, and, neck, cancer, have, the, highest, probability, of, dying, compared, to, those, who, have, never, smoked, this, effect, is, seen, in, patients, with, hpv, positive, head, and, neck, cancer, as, well, passive, smoking, both, at, work, and, at, home, also, increases, the, risk, of, head, and, neck, cancer, using, tobacco, together, with, alcohol, is, an, especially, high, risk, factor, for, head, and, neck, cancer, causing, 72, of, all, cases, this, rises, to, 89, when, looking, specifically, at, laryngeal, cancer, smokeless, tobacco, including, products, where, tobacco, is, chewed, is, also, a, cause, of, oral, cancer, cigar, and, pipe, smoking, are, also, important, risk, factors, for, oral, cancer, they, have, a, dose, dependent, relationship, with, more, consumption, leading, to, higher, chances, of, developing, cancer, the, use, of, electronic, cigarettes, may, also, lead, to, the, development, of, head, and, neck, cancers, due, to, the, substances, like, propylene, glycol, glycerol, nitrosamines, and, metals, contained, therein, which, can, cause, damage, to, the, airways, in, smoking, long, term, exposure, to, compounds, found, in, the, smoke, e, g, carbon, monoxide, and, cyanide, are, believed, to, be, responsible, for, pulmonary, damage, and, for, loss, of, elasticity, in, the, alveoli, leading, to, emphysema, and, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, copd, caused, by, smoking, is, a, permanent, incurable, often, terminal, reduction, of, pulmonary, capacity, characterised, by, shortness, of, breath, wheezing, persistent, cough, with, sputum, and, damage, to, the, lungs, including, emphysema, and, chronic, bronchitis, the, carcinogen, acrolein, and, its, derivatives, also, contribute, to, the, chronic, inflammation, present, in, copd, inhalation, of, tobacco, smoke, causes, several, immediate, responses, within, the, heart, and, blood, vessels, within, one, minute, the, heart, rate, begins, to, rise, increasing, by, as, much, as, 30, percent, during, the, first, 10, minutes, of, smoking, carbon, monoxide, in, tobacco, smoke, exerts, negative, effects, by, reducing, the, blood, s, ability, to, carry, oxygen, smoking, also, increases, the, chance, of, heart, disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, and, peripheral, vascular, disease, several, ingredients, of, tobacco, lead, to, the, narrowing, of, blood, vessels, increasing, the, likelihood, of, a, blockage, and, thus, a, heart, attack, or, stroke, according, to, a, study, by, an, international, team, of, researchers, people, under, 40, are, five, times, more, likely, to, have, a, heart, attack, if, they, are, smokers, exposure, to, tobacco, smoke, is, known, to, increase, oxidative, stress, in, the, body, by, various, mechanisms, including, depletion, of, plasma, antioxidants, such, as, vitamin, c, research, by, american, biologists, has, shown, that, cigarette, smoke, also, influences, the, process, of, cell, division, in, the, cardiac, muscle, and, changes, the, heart, s, shape, smoking, tobacco, has, also, been, linked, to, buerger, s, disease, thromboangiitis, obliterans, the, acute, inflammation, and, thrombosis, clotting, of, arteries, and, veins, of, the, hands, and, feet, although, cigarette, smoking, causes, a, greater, increase, in, the, risk, of, cancer, than, cigar, smoking, cigar, smokers, still, have, an, increased, risk, for, many, health, problems, including, cancer, when, compared, to, non, smokers, as, for, second, hand, smoke, the, nih, study, points, to, the, large, amount, of, smoke, generated, by, one, cigar, saying, cigars, can, contribute, substantial, amounts, of, tobacco, smoke, to, the, indoor, environment, and, when, large, numbers, of, cigar, smokers, congregate, in, a, cigar, smoking, event, the, amount, of, ets, i, e, second, hand, smoke, produced, is, sufficient, to, be, a, health, concern, for, those, regularly, required, to, work, in, those, environments, smoking, also, tends, to, increase, blood, cholesterol, levels, furthermore, the, ratio, of, high, density, lipoprotein, hdl, also, known, as, the, good, cholesterol, to, low, density, lipoprotein, ldl, also, known, as, the, bad, cholesterol, tends, to, be, lower, in, smokers, compared, to, non, smokers, smoking, also, raises, the, levels, of, fibrinogen, and, increases, platelet, production, both, involved, in, blood, clotting, which, makes, the, blood, thicker, and, more, likely, to, clot, carbon, monoxide, binds, to, hemoglobin, the, oxygen, carrying, component, in, red, blood, cells, resulting, in, a, much, stabler, complex, than, hemoglobin, bound, with, oxygen, or, carbon, dioxide, the, result, is, permanent, loss, of, blood, cell, functionality, blood, cells, are, naturally, recycled, after, a, certain, period, of, time, allowing, for, the, creation, of, new, functional, red, blood, cells, however, if, carbon, monoxide, exposure, reaches, a, certain, point, before, they, can, be, recycled, hypoxia, and, later, death, occurs, all, these, factors, make, smokers, more, at, risk, of, developing, various, forms, of, arteriosclerosis, hardening, of, the, arteries, as, the, arteriosclerosis, progresses, blood, flows, less, easily, through, rigid, and, narrowed, blood, vessels, making, the, blood, more, likely, to, form, a, thrombosis, clot, sudden, blockage, of, a, blood, vessel, may, lead, to, an, infarction, stroke, or, heart, attack, however, the, effects, of, smoking, on, the, heart, may, be, more, subtle, these, conditions, may, develop, gradually, given, the, smoking, healing, cycle, the, human, body, heals, itself, between, periods, of, smoking, and, therefore, a, smoker, may, develop, less, significant, disorders, such, as, worsening, or, maintenance, of, unpleasant, dermatological, conditions, e, g, eczema, due, to, reduced, blood, supply, smoking, also, increases, blood, pressure, and, weakens, blood, vessels, in, addition, to, increasing, the, risk, of, kidney, cancer, smoking, can, also, contribute, to, additional, renal, damage, smokers, are, at, a, significantly, increased, risk, for, chronic, kidney, disease, than, non, smokers, a, history, of, smoking, encourages, the, progression, of, diabetic, nephropathy, a, study, of, an, outbreak, of, an, h1n1, influenza, in, an, israeli, military, unit, of, 336, healthy, young, men, to, determine, the, relation, of, cigarette, smoking, to, the, incidence, of, clinically, apparent, influenza, revealed, that, of, 168, smokers, 68, 5, percent, had, influenza, as, compared, with, 47, 2, percent, of, nonsmokers, influenza, was, also, more, severe, in, the, smokers, 50, 6, percent, of, them, lost, work, days, or, required, bed, rest, or, both, as, compared, with, 30, 1, percent, of, the, nonsmokers, according, to, a, study, of, 1, 900, male, cadets, after, the, 1968, hong, kong, a2, influenza, epidemic, at, a, south, carolina, military, academy, compared, with, nonsmokers, heavy, smokers, more, than, 20, cigarettes, per, day, had, 21, more, illnesses, and, 20, more, bed, rest, light, smokers, 20, cigarettes, or, fewer, per, day, had, 10, more, illnesses, and, 7, more, bed, rest, the, effect, of, cigarette, smoking, upon, epidemic, influenza, was, studied, prospectively, among, 1, 811, male, college, students, clinical, influenza, incidence, among, those, who, daily, smoked, 21, or, more, cigarettes, was, 21, higher, than, that, of, non, smokers, influenza, incidence, among, smokers, of, 1, to, 20, cigarettes, daily, was, intermediate, between, non, smokers, and, heavy, cigarette, smokers, surveillance, of, a, 1979, influenza, outbreak, at, a, military, base, for, women, in, israel, revealed, that, influenza, symptoms, developed, in, 60, 0, of, the, current, smokers, vs, 41, 6, of, the, nonsmokers, smoking, seems, to, cause, a, higher, relative, influenza, risk, in, older, populations, than, in, younger, populations, in, a, prospective, study, of, community, dwelling, people, 60, 90, years, of, age, during, 1993, of, unimmunized, people, 23, of, smokers, had, clinical, influenza, as, compared, with, 6, of, non, smokers, smoking, may, substantially, contribute, to, the, growth, of, influenza, epidemics, affecting, the, entire, population, however, the, proportion, of, influenza, cases, in, the, general, non, smoking, population, attributable, to, smokers, has, not, yet, been, calculated, perhaps, the, most, serious, oral, condition, caused, by, smoking, including, pipe, smoking, is, oral, cancer, however, smoking, also, increases, the, risk, for, various, other, oral, diseases, some, almost, completely, exclusive, to, tobacco, users, roughly, half, of, periodontitis, or, inflammation, around, the, teeth, cases, are, attributed, to, current, or, former, smoking, smokeless, tobacco, causes, gingival, recession, and, white, mucosal, lesions, up, to, 90, of, periodontitis, patients, who, are, not, helped, by, common, modes, of, treatment, are, smokers, smokers, have, significantly, greater, loss, of, bone, height, than, nonsmokers, and, the, trend, can, be, extended, to, pipe, smokers, to, have, more, bone, loss, than, nonsmokers, smoking, has, been, proven, to, be, an, important, factor, in, the, staining, of, teeth, halitosis, or, bad, breath, is, common, among, tobacco, smokers, tooth, loss, has, been, shown, to, be, 2, to, 3, times, higher, in, smokers, than, in, non, smokers, in, addition, complications, may, further, include, leukoplakia, the, adherent, white, plaques, or, patches, on, the, mucous, membranes, of, the, oral, cavity, including, the, tongue, smoking, is, also, linked, to, susceptibility, to, infectious, diseases, particularly, in, the, lungs, pneumonia, smoking, more, than, 20, cigarettes, a, day, increases, the, risk, of, tuberculosis, by, two, to, four, times, and, being, a, current, smoker, has, been, linked, to, a, fourfold, increase, in, the, risk, of, invasive, disease, caused, by, the, pathogenic, bacteria, streptococcus, pneumoniae, it, is, believed, that, smoking, increases, the, risk, of, these, and, other, pulmonary, and, respiratory, tract, infections, both, through, structural, damage, and, through, effects, on, the, immune, system, the, effects, on, the, immune, system, include, an, increase, in, cd4, cell, production, attributable, to, nicotine, which, has, tentatively, been, linked, to, increased, hiv, susceptibility, smoking, increases, the, risk, of, kaposi, s, sarcoma, in, people, without, hiv, infection, one, study, found, this, only, with, the, male, population, and, could, not, draw, any, conclusions, for, the, female, participants, in, the, study, the, incidence, of, impotence, difficulty, achieving, and, maintaining, penile, erection, is, approximately, 85, percent, higher, in, male, smokers, compared, to, non, smokers, smoking, is, a, key, cause, of, erectile, dysfunction, ed, it, causes, impotence, because, it, promotes, arterial, narrowing, and, damages, cells, lining, the, inside, of, the, arteries, thus, leading, to, reduce, penile, blood, flow, smoking, is, harmful, to, the, ovaries, potentially, causing, female, infertility, and, the, degree, of, damage, is, dependent, upon, the, amount, and, length, of, time, a, woman, smokes, nicotine, and, other, harmful, chemicals, in, cigarettes, interfere, with, the, body, s, ability, to, create, estrogen, a, hormone, that, regulates, folliculogenesis, and, ovulation, also, cigarette, smoking, interferes, with, folliculogenesis, embryo, transport, endometrial, receptivity, endometrial, angiogenesis, uterine, blood, flow, and, the, uterine, myometrium, some, damage, is, irreversible, but, stopping, smoking, can, prevent, further, damage, smokers, are, 60, more, likely, to, be, infertile, than, non, smokers, smoking, reduces, the, chances, of, in, vitro, fertilization, ivf, producing, a, live, birth, by, 34, and, increases, the, risk, of, an, ivf, pregnancy, miscarrying, by, 30, american, psychologist, stated, smokers, often, report, that, cigarettes, help, relieve, feelings, of, stress, however, the, stress, levels, of, adult, smokers, are, slightly, higher, than, those, of, nonsmokers, adolescent, smokers, report, increasing, levels, of, stress, as, they, develop, regular, patterns, of, smoking, and, smoking, cessation, leads, to, reduced, stress, far, from, acting, as, an, aid, for, mood, control, nicotine, dependency, seems, to, exacerbate, stress, this, is, confirmed, in, the, daily, mood, patterns, described, by, smokers, with, normal, moods, during, smoking, and, worsening, moods, between, cigarettes, thus, the, apparent, relaxant, effect, of, smoking, only, reflects, the, reversal, of, the, tension, and, irritability, that, develop, during, nicotine, depletion, dependent, smokers, need, nicotine, to, remain, feeling, normal, users, report, feelings, of, relaxation, sharpness, calmness, and, alertness, those, new, to, smoking, may, experience, nausea, dizziness, increased, blood, pressure, narrowed, arteries, rapid, heart, beat, coughing, and, a, bad, taste, in, the, mouth, generally, the, unpleasant, symptoms, will, eventually, vanish, over, time, with, repeated, use, as, the, body, builds, a, tolerance, to, the, chemicals, in, the, cigarettes, such, as, nicotine, smokers, report, higher, levels, of, everyday, stress, several, studies, have, monitored, feelings, of, stress, over, time, and, found, reduced, stress, after, quitting, the, deleterious, mood, effects, of, everyday, between, cigarette, nicotine, withdrawal, symptoms, explain, why, people, who, smoke, experience, more, daily, stress, than, non, smokers, and, become, less, stressed, when, they, quit, smoking, deprivation, reversal, also, explains, much, of, the, arousal, data, with, deprived, smokers, being, less, vigilant, and, less, alert, than, non, deprived, smokers, or, non, smokers, recent, studies, have, shown, a, positive, relationship, between, psychological, distress, and, salivary, cotinine, levels, in, smoking, and, non, smoking, adults, indicating, that, both, firsthand, and, second, hand, smoke, exposure, may, lead, to, higher, levels, of, mental, stress, medical, researchers, have, found, that, smoking, is, a, predictor, of, divorce, smokers, have, a, 53, greater, chance, of, divorce, than, nonsmokers, the, usage, of, tobacco, can, also, create, cognitive, dysfunction, there, seems, to, be, an, increased, risk, of, alzheimer, s, disease, ad, although, case, control, and, cohort, studies, produce, conflicting, results, as, to, the, direction, of, the, association, between, smoking, and, ad, smoking, has, been, found, to, contribute, to, dementia, and, cognitive, decline, reduced, memory, and, cognitive, abilities, in, adolescents, and, brain, shrinkage, cerebral, atrophy, most, notably, some, studies, have, found, that, patients, with, alzheimer, s, disease, are, more, likely, not, to, have, smoked, than, the, general, population, which, has, been, interpreted, to, suggest, that, smoking, offers, some, protection, against, alzheimer, s, however, the, research, in, this, area, is, limited, and, the, results, are, conflicting, some, studies, show, that, smoking, increases, the, risk, of, alzheimer, s, disease, a, recent, review, of, the, available, scientific, literature, concluded, that, the, apparent, decrease, in, alzheimer, s, risk, may, be, simply, because, smokers, tend, to, die, before, reaching, the, age, at, which, alzheimer, s, normally, occurs, differential, mortality, is, always, likely, to, be, a, problem, where, there, is, a, need, to, investigate, the, effects, of, smoking, in, a, disorder, with, very, low, incidence, rates, before, age, 75, years, which, is, the, case, of, alzheimer, s, disease, it, stated, noting, that, smokers, are, only, half, as, likely, as, non, smokers, to, survive, to, the, age, of, 80, some, older, analyses, have, claimed, that, non, smokers, are, up, to, twice, as, likely, as, smokers, to, develop, alzheimer, s, disease, however, a, more, current, analysis, found, that, most, of, the, studies, which, showed, a, preventing, effect, had, a, close, affiliation, to, the, tobacco, industry, researchers, without, tobacco, lobby, influence, have, concluded, the, complete, opposite, smokers, are, almost, twice, as, likely, as, nonsmokers, to, develop, alzheimer, s, disease, former, and, current, smokers, have, a, lower, incidence, of, parkinson, s, disease, compared, to, people, who, have, never, smoked, although, the, authors, stated, that, it, was, more, likely, that, the, movement, disorders, which, are, part, of, parkinson, s, disease, prevented, people, from, being, able, to, smoke, than, that, smoking, itself, was, protective, another, study, considered, a, possible, role, of, nicotine, in, reducing, parkinson, s, risk, nicotine, stimulates, the, dopaminergic, system, of, the, brain, which, is, damaged, in, parkinson, s, disease, while, other, compounds, in, tobacco, smoke, inhibit, mao, b, an, enzyme, which, produces, oxidative, radicals, by, breaking, down, dopamine, in, many, respects, nicotine, acts, on, the, nervous, system, in, a, similar, way, to, caffeine, some, writings, have, stated, that, smoking, can, also, increase, mental, concentration, one, study, documents, a, significantly, better, performance, on, the, normed, advanced, raven, progressive, matrices, test, after, smoking, most, smokers, when, denied, access, to, nicotine, exhibit, withdrawal, symptoms, such, as, irritability, jitteriness, dry, mouth, and, rapid, heart, beat, the, onset, of, these, symptoms, is, very, fast, nicotine, s, half, life, being, only, two, hours, the, psychological, dependence, may, linger, for, months, or, even, many, years, unlike, some, recreational, drugs, nicotine, does, not, measurably, alter, a, smoker, s, motor, skills, judgement, or, language, abilities, while, under, the, influence, of, the, drug, nicotine, withdrawal, has, been, shown, to, cause, clinically, significant, distress, a, very, large, percentage, of, schizophrenics, smoke, tobacco, as, a, form, of, self, medication, the, high, rate, of, smoking, tobacco, by, the, mentally, ill, is, a, major, factor, in, their, decreased, life, expectancy, which, is, about, 25, years, shorter, than, the, general, population, following, the, observation, that, smoking, improves, condition, of, people, with, schizophrenia, in, particular, working, memory, deficit, nicotine, patches, had, been, proposed, as, a, way, to, treat, schizophrenia, some, studies, suggest, that, a, link, exists, between, smoking, and, mental, illness, citing, the, high, incidence, of, smoking, amongst, those, with, schizophrenia, and, the, possibility, that, smoking, may, alleviate, some, of, the, symptoms, of, mental, illness, but, these, have, not, been, conclusive, in, 2015, a, meta, analysis, found, that, smokers, were, at, greater, risk, of, developing, psychotic, illness, recent, studies, have, linked, smoking, to, anxiety, disorders, suggesting, the, correlation, and, possibly, mechanism, may, be, related, to, the, broad, class, of, anxiety, disorders, and, not, limited, to, just, depression, current, and, ongoing, research, attempt, to, explore, the, addiction, anxiety, relationship, data, from, multiple, studies, suggest, that, anxiety, disorders, and, depression, play, a, role, in, cigarette, smoking, a, history, of, regular, smoking, was, observed, more, frequently, among, individuals, who, had, experienced, a, major, depressive, disorder, at, some, time, in, their, lives, than, among, individuals, who, had, never, experienced, major, depression, or, among, individuals, with, no, psychiatric, diagnosis, people, with, major, depression, are, also, much, less, likely, to, quit, due, to, the, increased, risk, of, experiencing, mild, to, severe, states, of, depression, including, a, major, depressive, episode, depressed, smokers, appear, to, experience, more, withdrawal, symptoms, on, quitting, are, less, likely, to, be, successful, at, quitting, and, are, more, likely, to, relapse, a, number, of, studies, have, shown, that, tobacco, use, is, a, significant, factor, in, miscarriages, among, pregnant, smokers, and, that, it, contributes, to, a, number, of, other, threats, to, the, health, of, the, fetus, such, as, low, birth, weight, and, pre, term, birth, it, slightly, increases, the, risk, of, neural, tube, defects, environmental, tobacco, smoke, exposure, and, maternal, smoking, during, pregnancy, have, been, shown, to, cause, lower, infant, birth, weights, studies, have, shown, an, association, between, prenatal, exposure, to, environmental, tobacco, smoke, and, conduct, disorder, in, children, as, well, post, natal, tobacco, smoke, exposure, may, cause, similar, behavioral, problems, in, children, smoking, is, known, to, increase, levels, of, liver, enzymes, that, break, down, drugs, and, toxins, that, means, that, drugs, cleared, by, these, enzymes, are, cleared, more, quickly, in, smokers, which, may, result, in, the, drugs, not, working, specifically, levels, of, cyp1a2, and, cyp2a6, are, induced, substrates, for, 1a2, include, caffeine, and, tricyclic, antidepressants, such, as, amitriptyline, substrates, for, 2a6, include, the, anticonvulsant, valproic, acid, studies, suggest, that, smoking, decreases, appetite, but, did, not, conclude, that, overweight, people, should, smoke, or, that, their, health, would, improve, by, smoking, this, is, also, a, cause, of, heart, diseases, smoking, also, decreases, weight, by, overexpressing, the, gene, azgp1, which, stimulates, lipolysis, smoking, causes, about, 10, of, the, global, burden, of, fire, deaths, and, smokers, are, placed, at, an, increased, risk, of, injury, related, deaths, in, general, partly, due, to, also, experiencing, an, increased, risk, of, dying, in, a, motor, vehicle, crash, smoking, increases, the, risk, of, symptoms, associated, with, crohn, s, disease, a, dose, dependent, effect, with, use, of, greater, than, 15, cigarettes, per, day, there, is, some, evidence, for, decreased, rates, of, endometriosis, in, infertile, smoking, women, although, other, studies, have, found, that, smoking, increases, the, risk, in, infertile, women, there, is, little, or, no, evidence, of, a, protective, effect, in, fertile, women, some, preliminary, data, from, 1996, suggested, a, reduced, incidence, of, uterine, fibroids, but, overall, the, evidence, is, unconvincing, current, research, shows, that, tobacco, smokers, who, are, exposed, to, residential, radon, are, twice, as, likely, to, develop, lung, cancer, as, non, smokers, as, well, the, risk, of, developing, lung, cancer, from, asbestos, exposure, is, twice, as, likely, for, smokers, than, for, non, smokers, new, research, has, found, that, women, who, smoke, are, at, significantly, increased, risk, of, developing, an, abdominal, aortic, aneurysm, a, condition, in, which, a, weak, area, of, the, abdominal, aorta, expands, or, bulges, and, is, the, most, common, form, of, aortic, aneurysm, smoking, leads, to, an, increased, risk, of, bone, fractures, especially, hip, fractures, it, also, leads, to, slower, wound, healing, after, surgery, and, an, increased, rate, of, postoperative, healing, complication, tobacco, smokers, are, 30, 40, more, likely, to, develop, type, 2, diabetes, than, non, smokers, and, the, risk, increases, with, the, number, of, cigarettes, smoked, furthermore, diabetic, smokers, have, worse, outcomes, than, diabetic, non, smokers, against, the, background, of, the, overwhelmingly, negative, effects, of, smoking, on, health, some, observational, studies, have, suggested, that, smoking, might, have, specific, beneficial, effects, including, in, the, field, of, cardiovascular, disease, interest, in, this, epidemiological, phenomenon, has, also, been, aroused, by, covid, 19, systematic, review, of, reports, that, suggested, smokers, respond, better, to, treatment, for, ischemic, stroke, provided, no, support, for, such, claims, claims, of, surprising, benefits, of, smoking, based, on, observational, data, have, also, been, made, for, parkinson, s, disease, as, well, as, a, variety, of, other, conditions, including, basal, cell, carcinoma, malignant, melanoma, acute, mountain, sickness, pemphigus, celiac, disease, and, ulcerative, colitis, among, others, tobacco, smoke, has, many, bioactive, substances, including, nicotine, that, are, capable, of, exerting, a, variety, of, systemic, effects, surprising, correlations, may, also, stem, from, non, biological, factors, such, as, residual, confounding, that, is, to, say, the, methodological, difficulties, in, completely, adjusting, for, every, confounding, factor, that, can, affect, outcomes, in, observational, studies, in, the, case, of, parkinson, s, disease, a, series, of, observational, studies, that, consistently, suggest, a, possibly, substantial, reduction, in, risk, among, smokers, and, other, consumers, of, tobacco, products, has, led, to, longstanding, interest, among, epidemiologists, non, biological, factors, that, may, contribute, to, such, observations, include, reverse, causality, whereby, prodromal, symptoms, of, parkinson, s, disease, may, lead, some, smokers, to, quit, before, diagnosis, and, personality, considerations, people, predisposed, to, parkinson, s, disease, tend, to, be, relatively, risk, averse, and, may, be, less, likely, to, have, a, history, of, smoking, possible, existence, of, a, biological, effect, is, supported, by, a, few, studies, that, involved, low, levels, of, exposure, to, nicotine, without, any, active, smoking, a, data, driven, hypothesis, that, long, term, administration, of, very, low, doses, of, nicotine, for, example, in, an, ordinary, diet, might, provide, a, degree, of, neurological, protection, against, parkinson, s, disease, remains, open, as, a, potential, preventive, strategy, in, 1888, an, article, appeared, in, scientific, american, discussing, potential, germicidal, activity, of, tobacco, smoke, providing, immunity, against, yellow, fever, epidemic, of, florida, inspiring, research, in, the, lab, of, vincenzo, tassinari, at, the, hygienic, institute, of, the, university, of, pisa, who, explored, the, antimicrobial, activity, against, pathogens, including, bacillus, anthracis, tubercle, bacillus, bacillus, prodigiosus, staphylococcus, aureus, and, others, carbon, monoxide, is, a, bioactive, component, tobacco, smoke, that, has, been, explored, for, its, antimicrobial, properties, against, many, of, these, pathogens, on, epidemiological, grounds, unexpected, correlations, between, smoking, and, favorable, outcomes, initially, emerged, in, the, context, of, cardiovascular, disease, where, they, were, described, as, a, smoker, s, paradox, or, smoking, paradox, the, term, smoker, s, paradox, was, coined, in, 1995, in, relation, to, reports, that, smokers, appeared, to, have, unexpectedly, good, short, term, outcomes, following, acute, coronary, syndrome, or, stroke, one, of, the, first, reports, of, an, apparent, smoker, s, paradox, was, published, in, 1968, based, on, an, observation, of, relatively, decreased, mortality, in, smokers, one, month, after, experiencing, acute, myocardial, infarction, in, the, same, year, a, case, control, study, first, suggested, a, possible, protective, role, in, parkinson, s, disease, historical, claims, of, possible, benefits, in, schizophrenia, whereby, smoking, was, thought, to, ameliorate, cognitive, symptoms, are, not, supported, by, current, evidence, smoke, or, any, partially, burnt, organic, matter, contains, carcinogens, cancer, causing, agents, the, potential, effects, of, smoking, such, as, lung, cancer, can, take, up, to, 20, years, to, manifest, themselves, historically, women, began, smoking, en, masse, later, than, men, so, an, increased, death, rate, caused, by, smoking, amongst, women, did, not, appear, until, later, the, male, lung, cancer, death, rate, decreased, in, 1975, roughly, 20, years, after, the, initial, decline, in, cigarette, consumption, in, men, a, fall, in, consumption, in, women, also, began, in, 1975, but, by, 1991, had, not, manifested, in, a, decrease, in, lung, cancer, related, mortalities, amongst, women, smoke, contains, several, carcinogenic, pyrolytic, products, that, bind, to, dna, and, cause, genetic, mutations, particularly, potent, carcinogens, are, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, pah, which, are, toxicated, to, mutagenic, epoxides, the, first, pah, to, be, identified, as, a, carcinogen, in, tobacco, smoke, was, benzopyrene, which, has, been, shown, to, toxicate, into, an, epoxide, that, irreversibly, attaches, to, a, cell, s, nuclear, dna, which, may, either, kill, the, cell, or, cause, a, genetic, mutation, if, the, mutation, inhibits, programmed, cell, death, the, cell, can, survive, to, become, a, cancer, cell, similarly, acrolein, which, is, abundant, in, tobacco, smoke, also, irreversibly, binds, to, dna, causes, mutations, and, thus, also, cancer, however, it, needs, no, activation, to, become, carcinogenic, there, are, over, 19, known, carcinogens, in, cigarette, smoke, the, following, are, some, of, the, most, potent, carcinogens, sidestream, tobacco, smoke, or, exhaled, mainstream, smoke, is, particularly, harmful, because, exhaled, smoke, exists, at, lower, temperatures, than, inhaled, smoke, chemical, compounds, undergo, changes, which, can, cause, them, to, become, more, dangerous, as, well, smoke, undergoes, changes, as, it, ages, which, causes, the, transformation, of, the, compound, no, into, the, more, toxic, no, 2, further, volatilization, causes, smoke, particles, to, become, smaller, and, thus, more, easily, embedded, deep, into, the, lung, of, anyone, who, later, breathes, the, air, in, addition, to, chemical, nonradioactive, carcinogens, chewing, tobacco, and, tobacco, smoke, contain, small, amounts, of, lead, 210, 210, pb, and, polonium, 210, 210, po, both, of, which, are, radioactive, carcinogens, the, presence, of, polonium, 210, in, mainstream, cigarette, smoke, has, been, experimentally, measured, at, levels, of, 0, 0263, 0, 036, pci, 0, 97, 1, 33, mbq, which, is, equivalent, to, about, 0, 1, pci, per, milligram, of, smoke, 4, mbq, mg, or, about, 0, 81, pci, of, lead, 210, per, gram, of, dry, condensed, smoke, 30, bq, kg, research, by, ncar, radiochemist, ed, martell, suggested, that, radioactive, compounds, in, cigarette, smoke, are, deposited, in, hot, spots, where, bronchial, tubes, branch, that, tar, from, cigarette, smoke, is, resistant, to, dissolving, in, lung, fluid, and, that, radioactive, compounds, have, a, great, deal, of, time, to, undergo, radioactive, decay, before, being, cleared, by, natural, processes, indoors, these, radioactive, compounds, can, linger, in, second, hand, smoke, and, greater, exposure, would, occur, when, these, radioactive, compounds, are, inhaled, during, normal, breathing, which, is, deeper, and, longer, than, when, inhaling, cigarettes, damage, to, the, protective, epithelial, tissue, from, smoking, only, increases, the, prolonged, retention, of, insoluble, polonium, 210, compounds, produced, from, burning, tobacco, martell, estimated, that, a, carcinogenic, radiation, dose, of, 80, 100, rads, is, delivered, to, the, lung, tissue, of, most, smokers, who, die, of, lung, cancer, smoking, an, average, of, 1, 5, packs, per, day, gives, a, radiation, dose, of, 60, 160, msv, year, compared, with, living, near, a, nuclear, power, station, 0, 0001, msv, year, or, the, 3, 0, msv, year, average, dose, for, americans, some, of, the, mineral, apatite, in, florida, used, to, produce, phosphate, for, us, tobacco, crops, contains, uranium, radium, lead, 210, and, polonium, 210, and, radon, the, radioactive, smoke, from, tobacco, fertilized, this, way, is, deposited, in, lungs, and, releases, radiation, even, if, a, smoker, quits, the, habit, the, combination, of, carcinogenic, tar, and, radiation, in, a, sensitive, organ, such, as, lungs, increases, the, risk, of, cancer, in, contrast, a, 1999, review, of, tobacco, smoke, carcinogens, published, in, the, journal, of, the, national, cancer, institute, states, that, levels, of, polonium, 210, in, tobacco, smoke, are, not, believed, to, be, great, enough, to, significantly, impact, lung, cancer, in, smokers, in, 2011, hecht, has, also, stated, that, the, levels, of, 210, po, in, cigarette, smoke, are, probably, too, low, to, be, involved, in, lung, cancer, induction, free, radicals, and, pro, oxidants, in, cigarettes, damage, blood, vessels, and, oxidize, ldl, cholesterol, only, oxidized, ldl, cholesterol, is, taken, up, by, macrophages, which, become, foam, cells, leading, to, atherosclerotic, plaques, cigarette, smoke, increases, proinflammatory, cytokines, in, the, bloodstream, causing, atherosclerosis, the, pro, oxidative, state, also, leads, to, endothelial, dysfunction, which, is, another, important, cause, of, atherosclerosis, nicotine, which, is, contained, in, cigarettes, and, other, smoked, tobacco, products, is, a, stimulant, and, is, one, of, the, main, factors, leading, to, continued, tobacco, smoking, nicotine, is, a, highly, addictive, psychoactive, chemical, when, tobacco, is, smoked, most, of, the, nicotine, is, pyrolyzed, a, dose, sufficient, to, cause, mild, somatic, dependency, and, mild, to, strong, psychological, dependency, remains, the, amount, of, nicotine, absorbed, by, the, body, from, smoking, depends, on, many, factors, including, the, type, of, tobacco, whether, the, smoke, is, inhaled, and, whether, a, filter, is, used, there, is, also, a, formation, of, harmane, a, mao, inhibitor, from, the, acetaldehyde, in, cigarette, smoke, which, seems, to, play, an, important, role, in, nicotine, addiction, probably, by, facilitating, dopamine, release, in, the, nucleus, accumbens, in, response, to, nicotine, stimuli, according, to, studies, by, henningfield, and, benowitz, nicotine, is, more, addictive, than, cannabis, caffeine, alcohol, cocaine, and, heroin, when, considering, both, somatic, and, psychological, dependence, however, due, to, the, stronger, withdrawal, effects, of, alcohol, cocaine, and, heroin, nicotine, may, have, a, lower, potential, for, somatic, dependence, than, these, substances, about, half, of, canadians, who, currently, smoke, have, tried, to, quit, mcgill, university, health, professor, jennifer, o, loughlin, stated, that, nicotine, addiction, can, occur, as, soon, as, five, months, after, the, start, of, smoking, ingesting, a, compound, by, smoking, is, one, of, the, most, rapid, and, efficient, methods, of, introducing, it, into, the, bloodstream, second, only, to, injection, which, allows, for, the, rapid, feedback, which, supports, the, smokers, ability, to, titrate, their, dosage, on, average, it, takes, about, ten, seconds, for, the, substance, to, reach, the, brain, as, a, result, of, the, efficiency, of, this, delivery, system, many, smokers, feel, as, though, they, are, unable, to, cease, of, those, who, attempt, cessation, and, last, three, months, without, succumbing, to, nicotine, most, are, able, to, remain, smoke, free, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, there, exists, a, possibility, of, depression, in, some, who, attempt, cessation, as, with, other, psychoactive, substances, depression, is, also, common, in, teenage, smokers, teens, who, smoke, are, four, times, as, likely, to, develop, depressive, symptoms, as, their, nonsmoking, peers, although, nicotine, does, play, a, role, in, acute, episodes, of, some, diseases, including, stroke, impotence, and, heart, disease, by, its, stimulation, of, adrenaline, release, which, raises, blood, pressure, heart, and, respiration, rate, and, free, fatty, acids, the, most, serious, longer, term, effects, are, more, the, result, of, the, products, of, the, smoldering, combustion, process, this, has, led, to, the, development, of, various, nicotine, delivery, systems, such, as, the, nicotine, patch, or, nicotine, gum, that, can, satisfy, the, addictive, craving, by, delivering, nicotine, without, the, harmful, combustion, by, products, this, can, help, the, heavily, dependent, smoker, to, quit, gradually, while, discontinuing, further, damage, to, health, recent, evidence, has, shown, that, smoking, tobacco, increases, the, release, of, dopamine, in, the, brain, specifically, in, the, mesolimbic, pathway, the, same, neuro, reward, circuit, activated, by, addictive, substances, such, as, heroin, and, cocaine, this, suggests, nicotine, use, has, a, pleasurable, effect, that, triggers, positive, reinforcement, one, study, found, that, smokers, exhibit, better, reaction, time, and, memory, performance, compared, to, non, smokers, which, is, consistent, with, increased, activation, of, dopamine, receptors, neurologically, rodent, studies, have, found, that, nicotine, self, administration, causes, lowering, of, reward, thresholds, a, finding, opposite, that, of, most, other, addictive, substances, e, g, cocaine, and, heroin, the, carcinogenity, of, tobacco, smoke, is, not, explained, by, nicotine, per, se, which, is, not, carcinogenic, or, mutagenic, although, it, is, a, metabolic, precursor, for, several, compounds, which, are, in, addition, it, inhibits, apoptosis, therefore, accelerating, existing, cancers, also, nnk, a, nicotine, derivative, converted, from, nicotine, can, be, carcinogenic, nicotine, although, frequently, implicated, in, producing, tobacco, addiction, is, not, significantly, addictive, when, administered, alone, the, addictive, potential, manifests, itself, after, co, administration, of, an, maoi, which, specifically, causes, sensitization, of, the, locomotor, response, in, rats, a, measure, of, addictive, potential, second, hand, smoke, is, a, mixture, of, smoke, from, the, burning, end, of, a, cigarette, pipe, or, cigar, and, the, smoke, exhaled, from, the, lungs, of, smokers, it, is, involuntarily, inhaled, lingers, in, the, air, hours, after, cigarettes, have, been, extinguished, and, may, cause, a, wide, range, of, adverse, health, effects, including, cancer, respiratory, infections, and, asthma, studies, have, shown, that, exposure, to, second, hand, smoke, causes, harmful, effects, on, the, cardiovascular, system, and, is, associated, with, prevalent, heart, failure, among, non, smokers, non, smokers, who, are, exposed, to, second, hand, smoke, at, home, or, work, are, thought, due, to, a, wide, variety, of, statistical, studies, to, increase, their, heart, disease, risk, by, 25, 30, and, their, lung, cancer, risk, by, 20, 30, according, to, the, world, health, organization, second, hand, smoke, is, reported, to, kill, about, 1, million, people, per, year, and, causes, numerous, diseases, including, cancer, and, heart, diseases, the, current, us, surgeon, general, s, report, concludes, that, there, is, no, established, risk, free, level, of, exposure, to, second, hand, smoke, short, exposures, to, second, hand, smoke, are, believed, to, cause, blood, platelets, to, become, stickier, damage, the, lining, of, blood, vessels, decrease, coronary, flow, velocity, reserves, and, reduce, heart, rate, variability, potentially, increasing, the, mortality, of, heart, attacks, new, research, indicates, that, private, research, conducted, by, cigarette, company, philip, morris, in, the, 1980s, showed, that, second, hand, smoke, was, toxic, yet, the, company, suppressed, the, finding, during, the, next, two, decades, chewing, tobacco, has, been, known, to, cause, cancer, particularly, of, the, mouth, and, throat, according, to, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, some, health, scientists, have, suggested, that, smokeless, tobacco, should, be, used, in, smoking, cessation, programmes, and, have, made, implicit, or, explicit, claims, that, its, use, would, partly, reduce, the, exposure, of, smokers, to, carcinogens, and, the, risk, for, cancer, these, claims, however, are, not, supported, by, the, available, evidence, oral, and, spit, tobacco, increase, the, risk, for, leukoplakia, and, erythroplakia, a, precursor, to, oral, cancer, like, other, forms, of, smoking, cigar, smoking, poses, a, significant, health, risk, depending, on, dosage, risks, are, greater, for, those, who, inhale, more, when, they, smoke, smoke, more, cigars, or, smoke, them, longer, the, risk, of, dying, from, any, cause, is, significantly, greater, for, cigar, smokers, with, the, risk, particularly, higher, for, smokers, less, than, 65, years, old, and, with, risk, for, moderate, and, deep, inhalers, reaching, levels, similar, to, cigarette, smokers, the, increased, risk, for, those, smoking, 1, 2, cigars, per, day, is, too, small, to, be, statistically, significant, and, the, health, risks, of, the, 3, 4, of, cigar, smokers, who, smoke, less, than, daily, are, not, known, and, are, hard, to, measure, although, it, has, been, claimed, that, people, who, smoke, few, cigars, have, no, increased, risk, a, more, accurate, statement, is, that, their, risks, are, proportionate, to, their, exposure, health, risks, are, similar, to, cigarette, smoking, in, nicotine, addiction, periodontal, health, tooth, loss, and, many, types, of, cancer, including, cancers, of, the, mouth, throat, and, esophagus, cigar, smoking, also, can, cause, cancers, of, the, lung, and, larynx, where, the, increased, risk, is, less, than, that, of, cigarettes, many, of, these, cancers, have, extremely, low, cure, rates, cigar, smoking, also, increases, the, risk, of, lung, and, heart, diseases, such, as, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, a, common, belief, among, users, is, that, the, smoke, of, a, hookah, waterpipe, narghile, is, significantly, less, dangerous, than, that, from, cigarettes, the, water, moisture, induced, by, the, hookah, makes, the, smoke, less, irritating, and, may, give, a, false, sense, of, security, and, reduce, concerns, about, true, health, effects, doctors, at, institutions, including, the, mayo, clinic, have, stated, that, use, of, hookah, can, be, as, detrimental, to, a, person, s, health, as, smoking, cigarettes, and, a, study, by, the, world, health, organization, also, confirmed, these, findings, although, the, smoking, effects, are, similar, to, a, cigarettes, due, to, the, manner, in, which, a, hookah, is, utilized, smoking, hookah, may, potentially, absorb, a, higher, amount, of, toxic, substances, compared, to, cigarette, smokers, each, hookah, session, typically, lasts, more, than, 40, minutes, and, consists, of, 50, to, 200, inhalations, that, each, range, from, 0, 15, to, 0, 50, liters, of, smoke, in, an, hour, long, smoking, session, of, hookah, users, consume, about, 100, to, 200, times, the, smoke, of, a, single, cigarette, a, study, in, the, journal, of, periodontology, found, that, water, pipe, smokers, were, marginally, more, likely, than, regular, smokers, to, show, signs, of, gum, disease, showing, rates, 5, fold, higher, than, non, smokers, rather, than, the, 3, 8, fold, risk, that, regular, smokers, show, according, to, usa, today, people, who, smoked, water, pipes, had, five, times, the, risk, of, lung, cancer, of, non, smokers, a, study, on, hookah, smoking, and, cancer, in, pakistan, was, published, in, 2008, its, objective, was, to, find, serum, cea, levels, in, ever, exclusive, hookah, smokers, i, e, those, who, smoked, only, hookah, no, cigarettes, bidis, etc, prepared, between, 1, and, 4, times, a, day, with, a, quantity, of, up, to, 120, g, of, a, tobacco, molasses, mixture, each, i, e, the, tobacco, weight, equivalent, of, up, to, 60, cigarettes, of, 1, g, each, and, consumed, in, 1, to, 8, sessions, carcinoembryonic, antigen, cea, is, a, marker, found, in, several, forms, of, cancer, levels, in, exclusive, hookah, smokers, were, lower, compared, to, cigarette, smokers, although, the, difference, was, not, as, statistically, significant, as, that, between, a, hookah, smoker, and, a, non, smoker, also, the, study, concluded, that, heavy, hookah, smoking, 2, 4, daily, preparations, 3, 8, sessions, a, day, 2, hrs, to, 6, hours, substantially, raises, cea, levels, hookah, smokers, were, nearly, 6, times, more, likely, to, develop, lung, cancer, than, healthy, non, smokers, in, kashmir, dipping, tobacco, often, referred, to, as, dip, in, the, united, states, is, placed, in, the, mouth, between, the, cheek, and, gum, dipping, tobacco, does, not, need, to, be, chewed, for, the, nicotine, to, be, absorbed, first, time, users, of, these, products, often, become, nauseated, and, dizzy, long, term, effects, include, bad, breath, yellowed, teeth, and, an, increased, risk, of, oral, cancer, users, of, dipping, tobacco, are, believed, to, face, less, risk, of, some, cancers, than, are, smokers, but, are, still, at, greater, risk, than, people, who, do, not, use, any, tobacco, products, smokeless, tobacco, has, been, linked, with, oral, cancer, hypertension, and, heart, disease, they, also, have, an, equal, risk, of, other, health, problems, directly, linked, to, nicotine, such, as, increased, rate, of, atherosclerosis, education, and, counselling, by, physicians, of, children, and, adolescents, have, been, found, to, be, effective, in, decreasing, tobacco, use, the, world, health, organization, who, estimates, that, 5, 6, billion, people, or, 71, of, the, world, s, population, are, protected, by, at, least, one, tobacco, prevention, policy, though, tobacco, may, be, consumed, by, either, smoking, or, other, smokeless, methods, such, as, chewing, the, world, health, organization, who, only, collects, data, on, smoked, tobacco, smoking, has, therefore, been, studied, more, extensively, than, any, other, form, of, tobacco, consumption, in, 2000, smoking, was, practiced, by, 1, 22, billion, people, predicted, to, rise, to, 1, 45, billion, people, in, 2010, and, 1, 5, to, 1, 9, billion, by, 2025, if, prevalence, had, decreased, by, 2, a, year, since, 2000, this, figure, would, have, been, 1, 3, billion, in, 2010, and, 2025, despite, dropping, by, 0, 4, percent, from, 2009, to, 2010, the, united, states, still, reports, an, average, of, 17, 9, percent, usage, as, of, 2002, about, twenty, percent, of, young, teens, 13, 15, smoked, worldwide, with, 80, 000, to, 100, 000, children, taking, up, the, addiction, every, day, roughly, half, of, whom, live, in, asia, half, of, those, who, begin, smoking, in, adolescent, years, are, projected, to, go, on, to, smoke, for, 15, to, 20, years, teens, are, more, likely, to, use, e, cigarettes, than, cigarettes, about, 31, of, teenagers, who, use, e, cigs, started, smoking, within, six, months, compared, to, 8, of, non, smokers, manufacturers, do, not, have, to, report, what, is, in, e, cigs, and, most, teens, either, say, e, cigs, contain, only, flavoring, or, that, they, do, not, know, what, they, contain, the, who, states, that, much, of, the, disease, burden, and, premature, mortality, attributable, to, tobacco, use, disproportionately, affect, the, poor, of, the, 1, 22, billion, smokers, 1, billion, live, in, developing, or, transitional, nations, rates, of, smoking, have, leveled, off, or, declined, in, the, developed, world, in, the, developing, world, however, smoking, rates, were, rising, by, 3, 4, per, year, as, of, 2002, the, who, in, 2004, projected, 58, 8, million, deaths, to, occur, globally, 8, from, which, 5, 4, million, are, smoking, attributed, 23, and, 4, 9, million, as, of, 2007, as, of, 2002, 70, of, the, deaths, are, in, developing, countries, the, shift, in, prevalence, of, tobacco, smoking, to, a, younger, demographic, mainly, in, the, developing, world, can, be, attributed, to, several, factors, the, tobacco, industry, spends, up, to, 12, 5, billion, annually, on, advertising, which, is, increasingly, geared, towards, adolescents, in, the, developing, world, because, they, are, a, vulnerable, audience, for, the, marketing, campaigns, adolescents, have, more, difficulty, understanding, the, long, term, health, risks, that, are, associated, with, smoking, and, are, also, more, easily, influenced, by, images, of, romance, success, sophistication, popularity, and, adventure, which, advertising, suggests, they, could, achieve, through, the, consumption, of, cigarettes, this, shift, in, marketing, towards, adolescents, and, even, children, in, the, tobacco, industry, is, debilitating, to, organizations, and, countries, efforts, to, improve, child, health, and, mortality, in, the, developing, world, it, reverses, or, halts, the, effects, of, the, work, that, has, been, done, to, improve, health, care, in, these, countries, and, although, smoking, is, deemed, as, a, voluntary, health, risk, the, marketing, of, tobacco, towards, very, impressionable, adolescents, in, the, developing, world, makes, it, less, of, a, voluntary, action, and, more, of, an, inevitable, shift, presently, approximately, 8, million, individuals, succumb, to, tobacco, related, diseases, annually, resulting, in, a, significant, economic, burden, of, 1, 4, trillion, on, the, global, scale, each, year, in, the, us, smoking, is, considered, to, be, the, most, common, preventable, deaths, about, 480, 000, individuals, die, annually, due, to, smoking, in, the, us, alone, currently, the, number, of, premature, deaths, in, the, us, from, tobacco, use, per, year, exceeds, the, number, of, employees, in, the, tobacco, industry, by, 4, to, 1, it, has, been, estimated, that, tobacco, smoking, will, kill, about, 1, billion, people, in, the, 21st, century, if, current, smoking, patterns, continue, half, of, them, before, the, age, of, 70, china, has, the, largest, tobacco, smoking, population, followed, by, india, india, has, the, highest, tobacco, chewing, population, in, the, world, 154, people, die, every, hour, in, india, because, of, chewing, and, smoking, tobacco, many, government, regulations, have, been, passed, to, protect, citizens, from, harm, caused, by, public, environmental, tobacco, smoke, in, the, united, states, the, pro, children, s, act, of, 2001, prohibits, smoking, within, any, facility, that, provides, health, care, day, care, library, services, or, elementary, and, secondary, education, to, children, on, may, 23, 2011, new, york, city, enforced, a, smoking, ban, for, all, parks, beaches, and, pedestrian, malls, in, an, attempt, to, eliminate, threats, posed, to, civilians, by, environmental, tobacco, smoke, texts, on, the, harmful, effects, of, smoking, tobacco, were, recorded, in, the, timbuktu, manuscripts, james, i, wrote, a, book, that, denounced, tobacco, smoking, as, loathsome, to, the, eye, hateful, to, the, nose, harmful, to, the, brain, dangerous, to, the, lungs, pipe, smoking, gradually, became, generally, accepted, as, a, cause, of, mouth, cancers, following, work, done, in, the, 1700s, an, association, between, a, variety, of, cancers, and, tobacco, use, was, repeatedly, observed, from, the, late, 1800s, into, the, early, 1920s, gideon, lincecum, an, american, naturalist, and, practitioner, of, botanical, medicine, wrote, in, the, early, 19th, century, on, tobacco, this, poisonous, plant, has, been, used, a, great, deal, as, a, medicine, by, the, old, school, faculty, and, thousands, have, been, slain, by, it, it, is, a, very, dangerous, article, and, use, it, as, you, will, it, always, diminishes, the, vital, energies, in, exact, proportion, to, the, quantity, used, it, may, be, slowly, but, it, is, very, sure, the, 1880s, invention, of, automated, cigarette, making, machinery, in, the, american, south, made, it, possible, to, mass, produce, cigarettes, at, low, cost, and, smoking, became, common, this, led, to, a, backlash, and, a, tobacco, prohibition, movement, which, challenged, tobacco, use, as, harmful, and, brought, about, some, bans, on, tobacco, sale, and, use, in, 1912, american, dr, isaac, adler, was, the, first, to, strongly, suggest, that, lung, cancer, is, related, to, smoking, in, 1924, economist, irving, fisher, wrote, an, anti, smoking, article, for, reader, s, digest, which, said, tobacco, lowers, the, whole, tone, of, the, body, and, decreases, its, vital, power, and, resistance, tobacco, acts, like, a, narcotic, poison, like, opium, and, like, alcohol, though, usually, in, a, less, degree, in, december, 1952, the, reader, s, digest, reprinted, an, article, titled, cancer, by, the, carton, which, outlined, the, research, links, between, smoking, and, lung, cancer, prior, to, world, war, i, lung, cancer, was, considered, to, be, a, rare, disease, which, most, physicians, would, never, see, during, their, career, with, the, postwar, rise, in, popularity, of, cigarette, smoking, however, came, an, epidemic, of, lung, cancer, for, instance, it, is, estimated, that, 35, to, 79, percent, of, excess, veteran, deaths, due, to, heart, disease, and, lung, cancer, are, attributable, to, military, induced, smoking, from, the, 1890s, onwards, associations, of, tobacco, use, with, cancers, and, vascular, disease, were, regularly, reported, in, 1930, fritz, lickint, of, dresden, germany, published, a, meta, analysis, citing, 167, other, works, to, link, tobacco, use, to, lung, cancer, lickint, showed, that, people, with, lung, cancer, were, likely, to, be, smokers, he, also, argued, that, smoking, tobacco, was, the, best, way, to, explain, the, fact, that, lung, cancer, struck, men, four, or, five, times, more, often, than, women, since, women, smoked, much, less, and, discussed, the, causal, effect, of, smoking, on, cancers, of, the, liver, and, bladder, it, may, be, suggested, that, the, chief, reason, that, the, subject, has, received, so, little, attention, from, members, of, the, medical, profession, is, that, the, majority, of, them, as, of, the, general, community, practice, smoking, in, one, form, of, another, and, do, not, wish, to, inquire, too, closely, into, a, habit, in, defense, of, which, so, much, can, be, said, from, the, hedonistic, but, so, little, from, the, hygienic, standpoint, rolleston, jd, july, 1932, the, cigarette, habit, addiction, 30, 1, 1, 27, doi, 10, 1111, j, 1360, 0443, 1932, tb04849, x, s2cid, 72586449, more, observational, evidence, was, published, throughout, the, 1930s, and, in, 1938, science, published, a, paper, showing, that, tobacco, smokers, live, substantially, shorter, lives, it, built, a, survival, curve, from, family, history, records, kept, at, the, johns, hopkins, school, of, hygiene, and, public, health, this, result, was, ignored, or, incorrectly, explained, away, an, association, between, smoking, tobacco, and, heart, attacks, was, first, mentioned, in, 1930, a, large, case, control, study, found, a, significant, association, in, 1940, but, avoided, saying, anything, about, cause, on, the, grounds, that, such, a, conclusion, would, cause, controversy, and, doctors, were, not, yet, ready, for, it, official, hostility, to, tobacco, use, was, widespread, in, nazi, germany, where, case, control, studies, were, published, in, 1939, and, 1943, another, was, published, in, the, netherlands, in, 1948, a, case, control, study, on, lung, cancer, and, smoking, done, in, 1939, by, franz, hermann, m, ller, had, serious, weaknesses, in, its, methodology, but, study, design, problems, were, better, addressed, in, subsequent, studies, the, association, of, anti, tobacco, smoking, research, and, public, health, measures, with, the, nazi, leadership, may, have, contributed, to, the, lack, of, attention, paid, to, these, studies, they, were, also, published, in, german, and, dutch, these, studies, were, widely, ignored, in, 1947, the, british, medical, council, held, a, conference, to, discuss, the, reason, for, the, rise, in, lung, cancer, deaths, unaware, of, the, german, studies, they, planned, and, started, their, own, five, case, control, studies, published, in, 1950, by, researchers, from, the, us, and, uk, did, draw, widespread, attention, the, strongest, results, were, found, by, smoking, and, carcinoma, of, the, lung, preliminary, report, by, richard, doll, and, austin, bradford, hill, and, the, 1950, wynder, and, graham, study, entitled, tobacco, smoking, as, a, possible, etiologic, factor, in, bronchiogenic, carcinoma, a, study, of, six, hundred, and, eighty, four, proved, cases, these, two, studies, were, the, largest, and, the, only, ones, to, carefully, exclude, ex, smokers, from, their, nonsmokers, group, the, other, three, studies, also, reported, that, to, quote, one, smoking, was, powerfully, implicated, in, the, causation, of, lung, cancer, the, doll, and, hill, paper, reported, that, heavy, smokers, were, fifty, times, as, likely, as, non, smokers, to, contract, lung, cancer, early, case, control, studies, clearly, showed, a, close, association, between, smoking, and, lung, cancer, but, contemporary, doctors, and, scientists, did, not, feel, evidence, existed, for, causality, follow, up, large, prospective, cohort, studies, in, the, early, 1950s, showed, clearly, that, smokers, died, faster, and, were, more, likely, to, die, of, lung, cancer, cardiovascular, disease, and, a, list, of, other, diseases, which, lengthened, as, the, studies, continued, the, british, doctors, study, a, longitudinal, study, of, some, 40, 000, doctors, began, in, 1951, by, 1954, it, had, evidence, from, three, years, of, doctors, deaths, based, on, which, the, government, issued, advice, that, smoking, and, lung, cancer, rates, were, related, the, british, doctors, study, last, reported, in, 2001, by, which, time, there, were, approximately, 40, linked, diseases, the, british, doctors, study, demonstrated, that, about, half, of, the, persistent, cigarette, smokers, born, in, 1900, 1909, were, eventually, killed, by, their, addiction, in, 1953, scientists, at, the, sloan, kettering, institute, in, new, york, city, demonstrated, that, cigarette, tar, painted, on, the, skin, of, mice, caused, fatal, cancers, this, work, attracted, much, media, attention, the, new, york, times, and, life, both, covered, the, issue, the, reader, s, digest, published, an, article, entitled, cancer, by, the, carton, 14, on, january, 11, 1964, the, united, states, surgeon, general, s, report, on, smoking, and, health, was, published, this, led, millions, of, american, smokers, to, quit, the, banning, of, certain, types, of, advertising, and, the, requirement, of, warning, labels, on, tobacco, products, these, results, were, first, widely, accepted, in, the, medical, community, and, publicized, among, the, general, public, in, the, mid, 1960s, the, medical, community, s, resistance, to, the, idea, that, smoking, tobacco, caused, disease, has, been, attributed, to, bias, from, nicotine, dependent, doctors, the, novelty, of, the, adaptations, needed, to, apply, epidemiological, techniques, and, heuristics, to, non, infectious, diseases, and, cigarette, industry, pressure, the, harmful, health, effects, of, smoking, have, been, significant, for, the, development, of, the, science, of, epidemiology, as, the, mechanism, of, carcinogenicity, is, radiomimetic, or, radiological, the, effects, are, stochastic, definite, statements, can, be, made, only, on, the, relative, increased, or, decreased, probabilities, of, contracting, a, given, disease, for, a, particular, individual, it, is, impossible, to, definitively, prove, a, direct, causal, link, between, exposure, to, a, radiomimetic, poison, such, as, tobacco, smoke, and, the, cancer, that, follows, such, statements, can, only, be, made, at, the, aggregate, population, level, cigarette, companies, have, capitalized, on, this, philosophical, objection, and, exploited, the, doubts, of, clinicians, who, consider, only, individual, cases, on, the, causal, link, in, the, stochastic, expression, of, the, toxicity, as, actual, disease, there, have, been, multiple, court, cases, against, tobacco, companies, for, having, researched, the, health, effects, of, smoking, but, having, then, suppressed, the, findings, or, formatted, them, to, imply, lessened, or, no, hazard, after, a, ban, on, smoking, in, all, enclosed, public, places, was, introduced, in, scotland, in, march, 2006, there, was, a, 17, percent, reduction, in, hospital, admissions, for, acute, coronary, syndrome, 67, of, the, decrease, occurred, in, non, smokers
