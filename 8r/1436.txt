west, nile, fever, is, an, infection, by, the, west, nile, virus, which, is, typically, spread, by, mosquitoes, in, about, 80, of, infections, people, have, few, or, no, symptoms, about, 20, of, people, develop, a, fever, headache, vomiting, or, a, rash, in, less, than, 1, of, people, encephalitis, or, meningitis, occurs, with, associated, neck, stiffness, confusion, or, seizures, recovery, may, take, weeks, to, months, the, risk, of, death, among, those, in, whom, the, nervous, system, is, affected, is, about, 10, percent, west, nile, virus, wnv, is, usually, spread, by, mosquitoes, that, become, infected, when, they, feed, on, infected, birds, which, often, carry, the, disease, rarely, the, virus, is, spread, through, blood, transfusions, organ, transplants, or, from, mother, to, baby, during, pregnancy, delivery, or, breastfeeding, but, it, otherwise, does, not, spread, directly, between, people, risks, for, severe, disease, include, being, over, 60, years, old, and, having, other, health, problems, diagnosis, is, typically, based, on, symptoms, and, blood, tests, there, is, no, human, vaccine, the, best, way, to, reduce, the, risk, of, infection, is, to, avoid, mosquito, bites, mosquito, populations, may, be, reduced, by, eliminating, standing, pools, of, water, such, as, in, old, tires, buckets, gutters, and, swimming, pools, when, mosquitoes, cannot, be, avoided, mosquito, repellent, window, screens, and, mosquito, nets, reduce, the, likelihood, of, being, bitten, there, is, no, specific, treatment, for, the, disease, pain, medications, may, reduce, symptoms, the, virus, was, discovered, in, uganda, in, 1937, and, was, first, detected, in, north, america, in, 1999, wnv, has, occurred, in, europe, africa, asia, australia, and, north, america, in, the, united, states, thousands, of, cases, are, reported, a, year, with, most, occurring, in, august, and, september, it, can, occur, in, outbreaks, of, disease, severe, disease, may, also, occur, in, horses, for, which, a, vaccine, is, available, a, surveillance, system, in, birds, is, useful, for, early, detection, of, a, potential, human, outbreak, about, 80, of, those, infected, with, west, nile, virus, wnv, show, no, symptoms, and, go, unreported, about, 20, of, infected, people, develop, symptoms, these, vary, in, severity, and, begin, 3, to, 14, days, after, being, bitten, most, people, with, mild, symptoms, of, wnv, recover, completely, though, fatigue, and, weakness, may, last, for, weeks, or, months, symptoms, may, range, from, mild, such, as, fever, to, severe, such, as, paralysis, and, meningitis, a, severe, infection, can, last, weeks, and, can, rarely, cause, permanent, brain, damage, death, may, ensue, if, the, central, nervous, system, is, affected, medical, conditions, such, as, cancer, and, diabetes, and, age, over, 60, years, increase, the, risk, of, developing, severe, symptoms, headache, can, be, a, prominent, symptom, of, wnv, fever, meningitis, encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, and, it, may, or, may, not, be, present, in, poliomyelitis, like, syndrome, thus, headache, is, not, a, useful, indicator, of, neuroinvasive, disease, wnv, is, one, of, the, japanese, encephalitis, antigenic, serocomplex, of, viruses, image, reconstructions, and, cryoelectron, microscopy, reveal, a, 45, 50, nm, virion, covered, with, a, relatively, smooth, protein, surface, this, structure, is, similar, to, the, dengue, fever, virus, both, belong, to, the, genus, flavivirus, within, the, family, flaviviridae, the, genetic, material, of, wnv, is, a, positive, sense, single, strand, of, rna, which, is, between, 11, 000, and, 12, 000, nucleotides, long, these, genes, encode, seven, nonstructural, proteins, and, three, structural, proteins, the, rna, strand, is, held, within, a, nucleocapsid, formed, from, 12, kda, protein, blocks, the, capsid, is, contained, within, a, host, derived, membrane, altered, by, two, viral, membrane, proteins, west, nile, virus, has, been, seen, to, replicate, faster, and, spread, more, easily, to, birds, at, higher, temperatures, one, of, several, ways, climate, change, could, affect, the, epidemiology, of, this, disease, the, prime, method, of, spread, of, the, west, nile, virus, wnv, is, the, female, mosquito, in, europe, cats, were, identified, as, being, hosts, for, west, nile, virus, the, important, mosquito, vectors, vary, according, to, area, in, the, united, states, culex, pipiens, eastern, united, states, and, urban, and, residential, areas, of, the, united, states, north, of, 36, 39, n, culex, tarsalis, midwest, and, west, and, culex, quinquefasciatus, southeast, are, the, main, vector, species, in, europe, culex, pipiens, is, the, principal, vector, the, mosquito, species, that, are, most, frequently, infected, with, wnv, feed, primarily, on, birds, different, species, of, mosquitos, take, a, blood, meal, from, different, types, of, vertebrate, hosts, mosquitoes, show, further, selectivity, exhibiting, preference, for, different, species, of, birds, in, the, united, states, wnv, mosquito, vectors, feed, preferentially, on, members, of, the, corvidae, and, thrush, family, among, the, preferred, species, within, these, families, are, the, american, crow, a, corvid, and, the, american, robin, turdus, migratorius, some, species, of, birds, develop, sufficient, viral, levels, 10, 4, 2, log, pfu, ml, after, being, infected, to, transmit, the, infection, to, biting, mosquitoes, that, in, turn, go, on, to, infect, other, birds, in, birds, that, die, from, wnv, death, usually, occurs, after, 4, to, 6, days, in, mammals, and, several, species, of, birds, the, virus, does, not, multiply, as, readily, and, so, does, not, develop, high, viremia, during, infection, mosquitoes, biting, such, hosts, are, not, believed, to, ingest, sufficient, virus, to, become, infected, making, them, so, called, dead, end, hosts, as, a, result, of, the, differential, infectiousness, of, hosts, the, feeding, patterns, of, mosquitoes, play, an, important, role, in, wnv, transmission, and, they, are, partly, genetically, controlled, even, within, a, species, direct, human, to, human, transmission, initially, was, believed, to, be, caused, only, by, occupational, exposure, such, as, in, a, laboratory, setting, or, conjunctival, exposure, to, infected, blood, the, us, outbreak, identified, additional, transmission, methods, through, blood, transfusion, organ, transplant, intrauterine, exposure, and, breast, feeding, since, 2003, blood, banks, in, the, united, states, routinely, screen, for, the, virus, among, their, donors, as, a, precautionary, measure, the, uk, s, national, blood, service, initially, ran, a, test, for, this, disease, in, donors, who, donate, within, 28, days, of, a, visit, to, the, united, states, canada, or, the, northeastern, provinces, of, italy, and, the, scottish, national, blood, transfusion, service, asks, prospective, donors, to, wait, 28, days, after, returning, from, north, america, or, the, northeastern, provinces, of, italy, before, donating, there, also, have, been, reports, of, possible, transmission, of, the, virus, from, mother, to, child, during, pregnancy, or, breastfeeding, or, exposure, to, the, virus, in, a, lab, but, these, are, rare, cases, and, not, conclusively, confirmed, recently, the, potential, for, mosquito, saliva, to, affect, the, course, of, wnv, disease, was, demonstrated, mosquitoes, inoculate, their, saliva, into, the, skin, while, obtaining, blood, mosquito, saliva, is, a, pharmacological, cocktail, of, secreted, molecules, principally, proteins, that, can, affect, vascular, constriction, blood, coagulation, platelet, aggregation, inflammation, and, immunity, it, clearly, alters, the, immune, response, in, a, manner, that, may, be, advantageous, to, a, virus, studies, have, shown, it, can, specifically, modulate, the, immune, response, during, early, virus, infection, and, mosquito, feeding, can, exacerbate, wnv, infection, leading, to, higher, viremia, and, more, severe, forms, of, disease, vertical, transmission, the, transmission, of, a, viral, or, bacterial, disease, from, the, female, of, the, species, to, her, offspring, has, been, observed, in, various, west, nile, virus, studies, amongst, different, species, of, mosquitoes, in, both, the, laboratory, and, in, nature, mosquito, progeny, infected, vertically, in, autumn, may, potentially, serve, as, a, mechanism, for, wnv, to, overwinter, and, initiate, enzootic, horizontal, transmission, the, following, spring, although, it, likely, plays, little, role, in, transmission, in, the, summer, and, fall, risk, factors, independently, associated, with, developing, a, clinical, infection, with, wnv, include, a, suppressed, immune, system, and, a, patient, history, of, organ, transplantation, for, neuroinvasive, disease, the, additional, risk, factors, include, older, age, 50, male, sex, hypertension, and, diabetes, mellitus, a, genetic, factor, also, appears, to, increase, susceptibility, to, west, nile, disease, a, mutation, of, the, gene, ccr5, gives, some, protection, against, hiv, but, leads, to, more, serious, complications, of, wnv, infection, carriers, of, two, mutated, copies, of, ccr5, made, up, 4, 0, to, 4, 5, of, a, sample, of, people, with, west, nile, disease, while, the, incidence, of, the, gene, in, the, general, population, is, only, 1, 0, the, most, at, risk, occupations, in, the, u, s, are, outdoor, workers, for, example, farmers, loggers, landscapers, groundskeepers, construction, workers, painters, summer, camp, workers, and, pavers, two, reports, of, accidental, exposure, by, laboratory, personnel, working, with, infected, fluids, or, tissues, have, been, received, while, this, appears, to, be, a, rare, occurrence, it, highlights, the, need, for, proper, handling, of, infected, materials, the, world, health, organization, states, that, there, are, no, known, cases, of, health, care, workers, acquiring, the, virus, from, infected, patients, when, the, appropriate, infection, control, precautions, are, observed, preliminary, diagnosis, is, often, based, on, the, patient, s, clinical, symptoms, places, and, dates, of, travel, if, patient, is, from, a, non, endemic, country, or, area, activities, and, epidemiologic, history, of, the, location, where, infection, occurred, a, recent, history, of, mosquito, bites, and, an, acute, febrile, illness, associated, with, neurologic, signs, and, symptoms, should, cause, clinical, suspicion, of, wnv, diagnosis, of, west, nile, virus, infections, is, generally, accomplished, by, serologic, testing, of, blood, serum, or, cerebrospinal, fluid, csf, which, is, obtained, via, a, lumbar, puncture, initial, screening, could, be, done, using, the, elisa, technique, detecting, immunoglobulins, in, the, sera, of, the, tested, individuals, typical, findings, of, wnv, infection, include, lymphocytic, pleocytosis, elevated, protein, level, reference, glucose, and, lactic, acid, levels, and, no, erythrocytes, definitive, diagnosis, of, wnv, is, obtained, through, detection, of, virus, specific, antibody, igm, and, neutralizing, antibodies, cases, of, west, nile, virus, meningitis, and, encephalitis, that, have, been, serologically, confirmed, produce, similar, degrees, of, csf, pleocytosis, and, are, often, associated, with, substantial, csf, neutrophilia, specimens, collected, within, eight, days, following, onset, of, illness, may, not, test, positive, for, west, nile, igm, and, testing, should, be, repeated, a, positive, test, for, west, nile, igg, in, the, absence, of, a, positive, west, nile, igm, is, indicative, of, a, previous, flavivirus, infection, and, is, not, by, itself, evidence, of, an, acute, west, nile, virus, infection, if, cases, of, suspected, west, nile, virus, infection, sera, should, be, collected, on, both, the, acute, and, convalescent, phases, of, the, illness, convalescent, specimens, should, be, collected, 2, 3, weeks, after, acute, specimens, it, is, common, in, serologic, testing, for, cross, reactions, to, occur, among, flaviviruses, such, as, dengue, virus, denv, and, tick, borne, encephalitis, virus, this, necessitates, caution, when, evaluating, serologic, results, of, flaviviral, infections, four, fda, cleared, wnv, igm, elisa, kits, are, commercially, available, from, different, manufacturers, in, the, u, s, each, of, these, kits, is, indicated, for, use, on, serum, to, aid, in, the, presumptive, laboratory, diagnosis, of, wnv, infection, in, patients, with, clinical, symptoms, of, meningitis, or, encephalitis, positive, wnv, test, results, obtained, via, use, of, these, kits, should, be, confirmed, by, additional, testing, at, a, state, health, department, laboratory, or, cdc, in, fatal, cases, nucleic, acid, amplification, histopathology, with, immunohistochemistry, and, virus, culture, of, autopsy, tissues, can, also, be, useful, only, a, few, state, laboratories, or, other, specialized, laboratories, including, those, at, cdc, are, capable, of, doing, this, specialized, testing, a, number, of, various, diseases, may, present, with, symptoms, similar, to, those, caused, by, a, clinical, west, nile, virus, infection, those, causing, neuroinvasive, disease, symptoms, include, the, enterovirus, infection, and, bacterial, meningitis, accounting, for, differential, diagnoses, is, a, crucial, step, in, the, definitive, diagnosis, of, wnv, infection, consideration, of, a, differential, diagnosis, is, required, when, a, patient, presents, with, unexplained, febrile, illness, extreme, headache, encephalitis, or, meningitis, diagnostic, and, serologic, laboratory, testing, using, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, testing, and, viral, culture, of, csf, to, identify, the, specific, pathogen, causing, the, symptoms, is, the, only, currently, available, means, of, differentiating, between, causes, of, encephalitis, and, meningitis, many, of, the, guidelines, for, preventing, occupational, west, nile, virus, exposure, are, common, to, all, mosquito, borne, diseases, public, health, measures, include, taking, steps, to, reduce, mosquito, populations, personal, recommendations, are, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, being, bitten, general, measures, to, avoid, bites, include, west, nile, virus, can, be, sampled, from, the, environment, by, the, pooling, of, trapped, mosquitoes, via, ovitraps, carbon, dioxide, baited, light, traps, and, gravid, traps, testing, blood, samples, drawn, from, wild, birds, dogs, and, sentinel, monkeys, and, testing, brains, of, dead, birds, found, by, various, animal, control, agencies, and, the, public, testing, of, the, mosquito, samples, requires, the, use, of, reverse, transcriptase, pcr, rt, pcr, to, directly, amplify, and, show, the, presence, of, virus, in, the, submitted, samples, when, using, the, blood, sera, of, wild, birds, and, sentinel, chickens, samples, must, be, tested, for, the, presence, of, wnv, antibodies, by, use, of, immunohistochemistry, ihc, or, enzyme, linked, immunosorbent, assay, elisa, dead, birds, after, necropsy, or, their, oral, swab, samples, collected, on, specific, rna, preserving, filter, paper, card, can, have, their, virus, presence, tested, by, either, rt, pcr, or, ihc, where, virus, shows, up, as, brown, stained, tissue, because, of, a, substrate, enzyme, reaction, west, nile, control, is, achieved, through, mosquito, control, by, elimination, of, mosquito, breeding, sites, such, as, abandoned, pools, applying, larvacide, to, active, breeding, areas, and, targeting, the, adult, population, via, lethal, ovitraps, and, aerial, spraying, of, pesticides, with, aerial, pesticides, there, is, a, rising, need, to, develop, new, versions, as, pesticide, resistance, among, mosquitoes, can, occur, environmentalists, have, condemned, attempts, to, control, the, transmitting, mosquitoes, by, spraying, pesticide, saying, the, detrimental, health, effects, of, spraying, outweigh, the, relatively, few, lives, that, may, be, saved, and, more, environmentally, friendly, ways, of, controlling, mosquitoes, are, available, they, also, question, the, effectiveness, of, insecticide, spraying, as, they, believe, mosquitoes, that, are, resting, or, flying, above, the, level, of, spraying, will, not, be, killed, the, most, common, vector, in, the, northeastern, united, states, culex, pipiens, is, a, canopy, feeder, no, specific, treatment, is, available, for, wnv, infection, most, people, recover, without, treatment, in, mild, cases, over, the, counter, pain, relievers, can, help, ease, mild, headaches, and, muscle, aches, in, adults, in, severe, cases, supportive, care, is, provided, often, in, hospital, with, intravenous, fluids, pain, medication, respiratory, support, and, prevention, of, secondary, infections, while, the, general, prognosis, is, favorable, current, studies, indicate, that, west, nile, fever, can, often, be, more, severe, than, previously, recognized, with, studies, of, various, recent, outbreaks, indicating, that, it, may, take, as, long, as, 60, to, 90, days, to, recover, patients, with, milder, wnf, are, just, as, likely, as, those, with, more, severe, manifestations, of, neuroinvasive, disease, to, experience, multiple, somatic, complaints, such, as, tremor, and, dysfunction, in, motor, skills, and, executive, functions, for, over, a, year, people, with, milder, symptoms, are, just, as, likely, as, people, with, more, severe, symptoms, to, experience, adverse, outcomes, recovery, is, marked, by, a, long, convalescence, with, fatigue, one, study, found, that, neuroinvasive, wnv, infection, was, associated, with, an, increased, risk, for, subsequent, kidney, disease, wnv, was, first, isolated, from, a, feverish, 37, year, old, woman, at, omogo, in, the, west, nile, district, of, uganda, in, 1937, during, research, on, yellow, fever, virus, a, series, of, serosurveys, in, 1939, in, central, africa, found, anti, wnv, positive, results, ranging, from, 1, 4, congo, to, 46, 4, white, nile, region, sudan, it, was, subsequently, identified, in, egypt, 1942, and, india, 1953, a, 1950, serosurvey, in, egypt, found, 90, of, those, over, 40, years, in, age, had, wnv, antibodies, the, ecology, was, characterized, in, 1953, with, studies, in, egypt, and, israel, the, virus, became, recognized, as, a, cause, of, severe, human, meningoencephalitis, in, elderly, patients, during, an, outbreak, in, israel, in, 1957, the, disease, was, first, noted, in, horses, in, egypt, and, france, in, the, early, 1960s, and, found, to, be, widespread, in, southern, europe, southwest, asia, and, australia, the, first, appearance, of, wnv, in, the, western, hemisphere, was, in, 1999, with, encephalitis, reported, in, humans, dogs, cats, and, horses, and, the, subsequent, spread, in, the, united, states, may, be, an, important, milestone, in, the, evolving, history, of, this, virus, the, american, outbreak, began, in, college, point, queens, in, new, york, city, and, was, later, spread, to, the, neighboring, states, of, new, jersey, and, connecticut, the, virus, is, believed, to, have, entered, in, an, infected, bird, or, mosquito, although, there, is, no, clear, evidence, west, nile, virus, is, now, endemic, in, africa, europe, the, middle, east, west, and, central, asia, oceania, subtype, kunjin, and, most, recently, north, america, and, is, spreading, into, central, and, south, america, outbreaks, of, west, nile, virus, encephalitis, in, humans, have, occurred, in, algeria, 1994, romania, 1996, to, 1997, the, czech, republic, 1997, congo, 1998, russia, 1999, the, united, states, 1999, to, 2009, canada, 1999, 2007, israel, 2000, greece, 2010, and, israel, 2024, epizootics, of, disease, in, horses, occurred, in, morocco, 1996, italy, 1998, the, united, states, 1999, to, 2001, and, france, 2000, mexico, 2003, and, sardinia, 2011, in, august, 2024, in, warsaw, the, west, nile, virus, was, identified, in, bodies, of, dead, birds, corvidae, while, investigating, an, unusually, high, number, of, finds, outdoor, workers, including, biological, fieldworkers, construction, workers, farmers, landscapers, and, painters, healthcare, personnel, and, laboratory, personnel, who, perform, necropsies, on, animals, are, at, risk, of, contracting, wnv, in, 2012, the, us, experienced, one, of, its, worst, epidemics, in, which, 286, people, died, with, the, state, of, texas, being, hard, hit, by, this, virus, drought, has, been, associated, with, a, higher, number, of, west, nile, virus, cases, in, the, following, year, as, drought, can, decrease, fish, and, other, populations, that, eat, mosquito, eggs, higher, numbers, of, mosquitoes, can, result, higher, temperatures, are, linked, to, decreased, time, for, replication, and, increased, viral, load, in, birds, and, mosquitoes, a, vaccine, for, horses, atcvet, code, qi05aa10, who, based, on, killed, viruses, exists, some, zoos, have, given, this, vaccine, to, their, birds, although, its, effectiveness, is, unknown, dogs, and, cats, show, few, if, any, signs, of, infection, there, have, been, no, known, cases, of, direct, canine, human, or, feline, human, transmission, although, these, pets, can, become, infected, it, is, unlikely, they, are, in, turn, capable, of, infecting, native, mosquitoes, and, thus, continuing, the, disease, cycle, amd3100, which, had, been, proposed, as, an, antiretroviral, drug, for, hiv, has, shown, promise, against, west, nile, encephalitis, morpholino, antisense, oligos, conjugated, to, cell, penetrating, peptides, have, been, shown, to, partially, protect, mice, from, wnv, disease, there, have, also, been, attempts, to, treat, infections, using, ribavirin, intravenous, immunoglobulin, or, alpha, interferon, genomed, a, u, s, biotech, company, has, found, that, blocking, angiotensin, ii, can, treat, the, cytokine, storm, of, west, nile, virus, encephalitis, as, well, as, other, viruses, as, of, 2019, six, vaccines, had, progressed, to, human, trials, but, none, had, been, licensed, in, the, united, states, only, the, two, live, attenuated, vaccines, produced, strong, immunity, after, a, single, dose
