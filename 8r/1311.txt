epidemiology, is, the, study, and, analysis, of, the, distribution, who, when, and, where, patterns, and, determinants, of, health, and, disease, conditions, in, a, defined, population, it, is, a, cornerstone, of, public, health, and, shapes, policy, decisions, and, evidence, based, practice, by, identifying, risk, factors, for, disease, and, targets, for, preventive, healthcare, epidemiologists, help, with, study, design, collection, and, statistical, analysis, of, data, amend, interpretation, and, dissemination, of, results, including, peer, review, and, occasional, systematic, review, epidemiology, has, helped, develop, methodology, used, in, clinical, research, public, health, studies, and, to, a, lesser, extent, basic, research, in, the, biological, sciences, major, areas, of, epidemiological, study, include, disease, causation, transmission, outbreak, investigation, disease, surveillance, environmental, epidemiology, forensic, epidemiology, occupational, epidemiology, screening, biomonitoring, and, comparisons, of, treatment, effects, such, as, in, clinical, trials, epidemiologists, rely, on, other, scientific, disciplines, like, biology, to, better, understand, disease, processes, statistics, to, make, efficient, use, of, the, data, and, draw, appropriate, conclusions, social, sciences, to, better, understand, proximate, and, distal, causes, and, engineering, for, exposure, assessment, epidemiology, literally, meaning, the, study, of, what, is, upon, the, people, is, derived, from, greek, epi, upon, among, demos, people, district, and, logos, study, word, discourse, suggesting, that, it, applies, only, to, human, populations, however, the, term, is, widely, used, in, studies, of, zoological, populations, veterinary, epidemiology, although, the, term, epizoology, is, available, and, it, has, also, been, applied, to, studies, of, plant, populations, botanical, or, plant, disease, epidemiology, the, distinction, between, epidemic, and, endemic, was, first, drawn, by, hippocrates, to, distinguish, between, diseases, that, are, visited, upon, a, population, epidemic, from, those, that, reside, within, a, population, endemic, the, term, epidemiology, appears, to, have, first, been, used, to, describe, the, study, of, epidemics, in, 1802, by, the, spanish, physician, joaqu, n, de, villalba, in, epidemiolog, a, espa, ola, epidemiologists, also, study, the, interaction, of, diseases, in, a, population, a, condition, known, as, a, syndemic, the, term, epidemiology, is, now, widely, applied, to, cover, the, description, and, causation, of, not, only, epidemic, infectious, disease, but, of, disease, in, general, including, related, conditions, some, examples, of, topics, examined, through, epidemiology, include, as, high, blood, pressure, mental, illness, and, obesity, therefore, this, epidemiology, is, based, upon, how, the, pattern, of, the, disease, causes, change, in, the, function, of, human, beings, the, greek, physician, hippocrates, taught, by, democritus, was, known, as, the, father, of, medicine, sought, a, logic, to, sickness, he, is, the, first, person, known, to, have, examined, the, relationships, between, the, occurrence, of, disease, and, environmental, influences, hippocrates, believed, sickness, of, the, human, body, to, be, caused, by, an, imbalance, of, the, four, humors, black, bile, yellow, bile, blood, and, phlegm, the, cure, to, the, sickness, was, to, remove, or, add, the, humor, in, question, to, balance, the, body, this, belief, led, to, the, application, of, bloodletting, and, dieting, in, medicine, he, coined, the, terms, endemic, for, diseases, usually, found, in, some, places, but, not, in, others, and, epidemic, for, diseases, that, are, seen, at, some, times, but, not, others, in, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, a, doctor, from, verona, named, girolamo, fracastoro, was, the, first, to, propose, a, theory, that, the, very, small, unseeable, particles, that, cause, disease, were, alive, they, were, considered, to, be, able, to, spread, by, air, multiply, by, themselves, and, to, be, destroyable, by, fire, in, this, way, he, refuted, galen, s, miasma, theory, poison, gas, in, sick, people, in, 1543, he, wrote, a, book, de, contagione, et, contagiosis, morbis, in, which, he, was, the, first, to, promote, personal, and, environmental, hygiene, to, prevent, disease, the, development, of, a, sufficiently, powerful, microscope, by, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, in, 1675, provided, visual, evidence, of, living, particles, consistent, with, a, germ, theory, of, disease, during, the, ming, dynasty, wu, youke, 1582, 1652, developed, the, idea, that, some, diseases, were, caused, by, transmissible, agents, which, he, called, li, qi, or, pestilential, factors, when, he, observed, various, epidemics, rage, around, him, between, 1641, and, 1644, his, book, wen, yi, lun, treatise, on, pestilence, treatise, of, epidemic, diseases, can, be, regarded, as, the, main, etiological, work, that, brought, forward, the, concept, his, concepts, were, still, being, considered, in, analysing, sars, outbreak, by, who, in, 2004, in, the, context, of, traditional, chinese, medicine, another, pioneer, thomas, sydenham, 1624, 1689, was, the, first, to, distinguish, the, fevers, of, londoners, in, the, later, 1600s, his, theories, on, cures, of, fevers, met, with, much, resistance, from, traditional, physicians, at, the, time, he, was, not, able, to, find, the, initial, cause, of, the, smallpox, fever, he, researched, and, treated, john, graunt, a, haberdasher, and, amateur, statistician, published, natural, and, political, observations, upon, the, bills, of, mortality, in, 1662, in, it, he, analysed, the, mortality, rolls, in, london, before, the, great, plague, presented, one, of, the, first, life, tables, and, reported, time, trends, for, many, diseases, new, and, old, he, provided, statistical, evidence, for, many, theories, on, disease, and, also, refuted, some, widespread, ideas, on, them, john, snow, is, famous, for, his, investigations, into, the, causes, of, the, 19th, century, cholera, epidemics, and, is, also, known, as, the, father, of, modern, epidemiology, he, began, with, noticing, the, significantly, higher, death, rates, in, two, areas, supplied, by, southwark, company, his, identification, of, the, broad, street, pump, as, the, cause, of, the, soho, epidemic, is, considered, the, classic, example, of, epidemiology, snow, used, chlorine, in, an, attempt, to, clean, the, water, and, removed, the, handle, this, ended, the, outbreak, this, has, been, perceived, as, a, major, event, in, the, history, of, public, health, and, regarded, as, the, founding, event, of, the, science, of, epidemiology, having, helped, shape, public, health, policies, around, the, world, however, snow, s, research, and, preventive, measures, to, avoid, further, outbreaks, were, not, fully, accepted, or, put, into, practice, until, after, his, death, due, to, the, prevailing, miasma, theory, of, the, time, a, model, of, disease, in, which, poor, air, quality, was, blamed, for, illness, this, was, used, to, rationalize, high, rates, of, infection, in, impoverished, areas, instead, of, addressing, the, underlying, issues, of, poor, nutrition, and, sanitation, and, was, proven, false, by, his, work, other, pioneers, include, danish, physician, peter, anton, schleisner, who, in, 1849, related, his, work, on, the, prevention, of, the, epidemic, of, neonatal, tetanus, on, the, vestmanna, islands, in, iceland, another, important, pioneer, was, hungarian, physician, ignaz, semmelweis, who, in, 1847, brought, down, infant, mortality, at, a, vienna, hospital, by, instituting, a, disinfection, procedure, his, findings, were, published, in, 1850, but, his, work, was, ill, received, by, his, colleagues, who, discontinued, the, procedure, disinfection, did, not, become, widely, practiced, until, british, surgeon, joseph, lister, discovered, antiseptics, in, 1865, in, light, of, the, work, of, louis, pasteur, in, the, early, 20th, century, mathematical, methods, were, introduced, into, epidemiology, by, ronald, ross, janet, lane, claypon, anderson, gray, mckendrick, and, others, in, a, parallel, development, during, the, 1920s, german, swiss, pathologist, max, askanazy, and, others, founded, the, international, society, for, geographical, pathology, to, systematically, investigate, the, geographical, pathology, of, cancer, and, other, non, infectious, diseases, across, populations, in, different, regions, after, world, war, ii, richard, doll, and, other, non, pathologists, joined, the, field, and, advanced, methods, to, study, cancer, a, disease, with, patterns, and, mode, of, occurrences, that, could, not, be, suitably, studied, with, the, methods, developed, for, epidemics, of, infectious, diseases, geography, pathology, eventually, combined, with, infectious, disease, epidemiology, to, make, the, field, that, is, epidemiology, today, another, breakthrough, was, the, 1954, publication, of, the, results, of, a, british, doctors, study, led, by, richard, doll, and, austin, bradford, hill, which, lent, very, strong, statistical, support, to, the, link, between, tobacco, smoking, and, lung, cancer, in, the, late, 20th, century, with, the, advancement, of, biomedical, sciences, a, number, of, molecular, markers, in, blood, other, biospecimens, and, environment, were, identified, as, predictors, of, development, or, risk, of, a, certain, disease, epidemiology, research, to, examine, the, relationship, between, these, biomarkers, analyzed, at, the, molecular, level, and, disease, was, broadly, named, molecular, epidemiology, specifically, genetic, epidemiology, has, been, used, for, epidemiology, of, germline, genetic, variation, and, disease, genetic, variation, is, typically, determined, using, dna, from, peripheral, blood, leukocytes, since, the, 2000s, genome, wide, association, studies, gwas, have, been, commonly, performed, to, identify, genetic, risk, factors, for, many, diseases, and, health, conditions, while, most, molecular, epidemiology, studies, are, still, using, conventional, disease, diagnosis, and, classification, systems, it, is, increasingly, recognized, that, disease, progression, represents, inherently, heterogeneous, processes, differing, from, person, to, person, conceptually, each, individual, has, a, unique, disease, process, different, from, any, other, individual, the, unique, disease, principle, considering, uniqueness, of, the, exposome, a, totality, of, endogenous, and, exogenous, environmental, exposures, and, its, unique, influence, on, molecular, pathologic, process, in, each, individual, studies, to, examine, the, relationship, between, an, exposure, and, molecular, pathologic, signature, of, disease, particularly, cancer, became, increasingly, common, throughout, the, 2000s, however, the, use, of, molecular, pathology, in, epidemiology, posed, unique, challenges, including, lack, of, research, guidelines, and, standardized, statistical, methodologies, and, paucity, of, interdisciplinary, experts, and, training, programs, furthermore, the, concept, of, disease, heterogeneity, appears, to, conflict, with, the, long, standing, premise, in, epidemiology, that, individuals, with, the, same, disease, name, have, similar, etiologies, and, disease, processes, to, resolve, these, issues, and, advance, population, health, science, in, the, era, of, molecular, precision, medicine, molecular, pathology, and, epidemiology, was, integrated, to, create, a, new, interdisciplinary, field, of, molecular, pathological, epidemiology, mpe, defined, as, epidemiology, of, molecular, pathology, and, heterogeneity, of, disease, in, mpe, investigators, analyze, the, relationships, between, a, environmental, dietary, lifestyle, and, genetic, factors, b, alterations, in, cellular, or, extracellular, molecules, and, c, evolution, and, progression, of, disease, a, better, understanding, of, heterogeneity, of, disease, pathogenesis, will, further, contribute, to, elucidate, etiologies, of, disease, the, mpe, approach, can, be, applied, to, not, only, neoplastic, diseases, but, also, non, neoplastic, diseases, the, concept, and, paradigm, of, mpe, have, become, widespread, in, the, 2010s, by, 2012, it, was, recognized, that, many, pathogens, evolution, is, rapid, enough, to, be, highly, relevant, to, epidemiology, and, that, therefore, much, could, be, gained, from, an, interdisciplinary, approach, to, infectious, disease, integrating, epidemiology, and, molecular, evolution, to, inform, control, strategies, or, even, patient, treatment, modern, epidemiological, studies, can, use, advanced, statistics, and, machine, learning, to, create, predictive, models, as, well, as, to, define, treatment, effects, there, is, increasing, recognition, that, a, wide, range, of, modern, data, sources, many, not, originating, from, healthcare, or, epidemiology, can, be, used, for, epidemiological, study, such, digital, epidemiology, can, include, data, from, internet, searching, mobile, phone, records, and, retail, sales, of, drugs, epidemiologists, employ, a, range, of, study, designs, from, the, observational, to, experimental, and, generally, categorized, as, descriptive, involving, the, assessment, of, data, covering, time, place, and, person, analytic, aiming, to, further, examine, known, associations, or, hypothesized, relationships, and, experimental, a, term, often, equated, with, clinical, or, community, trials, of, treatments, and, other, interventions, in, observational, studies, nature, is, allowed, to, take, its, course, as, epidemiologists, observe, from, the, sidelines, conversely, in, experimental, studies, the, epidemiologist, is, the, one, in, control, of, all, of, the, factors, entering, a, certain, case, study, epidemiological, studies, are, aimed, where, possible, at, revealing, unbiased, relationships, between, exposures, such, as, alcohol, or, smoking, biological, agents, stress, or, chemicals, to, mortality, or, morbidity, the, identification, of, causal, relationships, between, these, exposures, and, outcomes, is, an, important, aspect, of, epidemiology, modern, epidemiologists, use, informatics, and, infodemiology, as, tools, observational, studies, have, two, components, descriptive, and, analytical, descriptive, observations, pertain, to, the, who, what, where, and, when, of, health, related, state, occurrence, however, analytical, observations, deal, more, with, the, how, of, a, health, related, event, experimental, epidemiology, contains, three, case, types, randomized, controlled, trials, often, used, for, a, new, medicine, or, drug, testing, field, trials, conducted, on, those, at, a, high, risk, of, contracting, a, disease, and, community, trials, research, on, social, originating, diseases, the, term, epidemiologic, triad, is, used, to, describe, the, intersection, of, host, agent, and, environment, in, analyzing, an, outbreak, case, series, may, refer, to, the, qualitative, study, of, the, experience, of, a, single, patient, or, small, group, of, patients, with, a, similar, diagnosis, or, to, a, statistical, factor, with, the, potential, to, produce, illness, with, periods, when, they, are, unexposed, the, former, type, of, study, is, purely, descriptive, and, cannot, be, used, to, make, inferences, about, the, general, population, of, patients, with, that, disease, these, types, of, studies, in, which, an, astute, clinician, identifies, an, unusual, feature, of, a, disease, or, a, patient, s, history, may, lead, to, a, formulation, of, a, new, hypothesis, using, the, data, from, the, series, analytic, studies, could, be, done, to, investigate, possible, causal, factors, these, can, include, case, control, studies, or, prospective, studies, a, case, control, study, would, involve, matching, comparable, controls, without, the, disease, to, the, cases, in, the, series, a, prospective, study, would, involve, following, the, case, series, over, time, to, evaluate, the, disease, s, natural, history, the, latter, type, more, formally, described, as, self, controlled, case, series, studies, divide, individual, patient, follow, up, time, into, exposed, and, unexposed, periods, and, use, fixed, effects, poisson, regression, processes, to, compare, the, incidence, rate, of, a, given, outcome, between, exposed, and, unexposed, periods, this, technique, has, been, extensively, used, in, the, study, of, adverse, reactions, to, vaccination, and, has, been, shown, in, some, circumstances, to, provide, statistical, power, comparable, to, that, available, in, cohort, studies, case, control, studies, select, subjects, based, on, their, disease, status, it, is, a, retrospective, study, a, group, of, individuals, that, are, disease, positive, the, case, group, is, compared, with, a, group, of, disease, negative, individuals, the, control, group, the, control, group, should, ideally, come, from, the, same, population, that, gave, rise, to, the, cases, the, case, control, study, looks, back, through, time, at, potential, exposures, that, both, groups, cases, and, controls, may, have, encountered, a, 2, 2, table, is, constructed, displaying, exposed, cases, a, exposed, controls, b, unexposed, cases, c, and, unexposed, controls, d, the, statistic, generated, to, measure, association, is, the, odds, ratio, or, which, is, the, ratio, of, the, odds, of, exposure, in, the, cases, a, c, to, the, odds, of, exposure, in, the, controls, b, d, i, e, or, ad, bc, if, the, or, is, significantly, greater, than, 1, then, the, conclusion, is, those, with, the, disease, are, more, likely, to, have, been, exposed, whereas, if, it, is, close, to, 1, then, the, exposure, and, disease, are, not, likely, associated, if, the, or, is, far, less, than, one, then, this, suggests, that, the, exposure, is, a, protective, factor, in, the, causation, of, the, disease, case, control, studies, are, usually, faster, and, more, cost, effective, than, cohort, studies, but, are, sensitive, to, bias, such, as, recall, bias, and, selection, bias, the, main, challenge, is, to, identify, the, appropriate, control, group, the, distribution, of, exposure, among, the, control, group, should, be, representative, of, the, distribution, in, the, population, that, gave, rise, to, the, cases, this, can, be, achieved, by, drawing, a, random, sample, from, the, original, population, at, risk, this, has, as, a, consequence, that, the, control, group, can, contain, people, with, the, disease, under, study, when, the, disease, has, a, high, attack, rate, in, a, population, a, major, drawback, for, case, control, studies, is, that, in, order, to, be, considered, to, be, statistically, significant, the, minimum, number, of, cases, required, at, the, 95, confidence, interval, is, related, to, the, odds, ratio, by, the, equation, where, n, is, the, ratio, of, cases, to, controls, as, the, odds, ratio, approaches, 1, the, number, of, cases, required, for, statistical, significance, grows, towards, infinity, rendering, case, control, studies, all, but, useless, for, low, odds, ratios, for, instance, for, an, odds, ratio, of, 1, 5, and, cases, controls, the, table, shown, above, would, look, like, this, for, an, odds, ratio, of, 1, 1, cohort, studies, select, subjects, based, on, their, exposure, status, the, study, subjects, should, be, at, risk, of, the, outcome, under, investigation, at, the, beginning, of, the, cohort, study, this, usually, means, that, they, should, be, disease, free, when, the, cohort, study, starts, the, cohort, is, followed, through, time, to, assess, their, later, outcome, status, an, example, of, a, cohort, study, would, be, the, investigation, of, a, cohort, of, smokers, and, non, smokers, over, time, to, estimate, the, incidence, of, lung, cancer, the, same, 2, 2, table, is, constructed, as, with, the, case, control, study, however, the, point, estimate, generated, is, the, relative, risk, rr, which, is, the, probability, of, disease, for, a, person, in, the, exposed, group, p, e, a, a, b, over, the, probability, of, disease, for, a, person, in, the, unexposed, group, p, u, c, c, d, i, e, rr, p, e, p, u, as, with, the, or, a, rr, greater, than, 1, shows, association, where, the, conclusion, can, be, read, those, with, the, exposure, were, more, likely, to, develop, the, disease, prospective, studies, have, many, benefits, over, case, control, studies, the, rr, is, a, more, powerful, effect, measure, than, the, or, as, the, or, is, just, an, estimation, of, the, rr, since, true, incidence, cannot, be, calculated, in, a, case, control, study, where, subjects, are, selected, based, on, disease, status, temporality, can, be, established, in, a, prospective, study, and, confounders, are, more, easily, controlled, for, however, they, are, more, costly, and, there, is, a, greater, chance, of, losing, subjects, to, follow, up, based, on, the, long, time, period, over, which, the, cohort, is, followed, cohort, studies, also, are, limited, by, the, same, equation, for, number, of, cases, as, for, cohort, studies, but, if, the, base, incidence, rate, in, the, study, population, is, very, low, the, number, of, cases, required, is, reduced, by, 1, 2, although, epidemiology, is, sometimes, viewed, as, a, collection, of, statistical, tools, used, to, elucidate, the, associations, of, exposures, to, health, outcomes, a, deeper, understanding, of, this, science, is, that, of, discovering, causal, relationships, correlation, does, not, imply, causation, is, a, common, theme, for, much, of, the, epidemiological, literature, for, epidemiologists, the, key, is, in, the, term, inference, correlation, or, at, least, association, between, two, variables, is, a, necessary, but, not, sufficient, criterion, for, the, inference, that, one, variable, causes, the, other, epidemiologists, use, gathered, data, and, a, broad, range, of, biomedical, and, psychosocial, theories, in, an, iterative, way, to, generate, or, expand, theory, to, test, hypotheses, and, to, make, educated, informed, assertions, about, which, relationships, are, causal, and, about, exactly, how, they, are, causal, epidemiologists, emphasize, that, the, one, cause, one, effect, understanding, is, a, simplistic, mis, belief, most, outcomes, whether, disease, or, death, are, caused, by, a, chain, or, web, consisting, of, many, component, causes, causes, can, be, distinguished, as, necessary, sufficient, or, probabilistic, conditions, if, a, necessary, condition, can, be, identified, and, controlled, e, g, antibodies, to, a, disease, agent, energy, in, an, injury, the, harmful, outcome, can, be, avoided, robertson, 2015, one, tool, regularly, used, to, conceptualize, the, multicausality, associated, with, disease, is, the, causal, pie, model, in, 1965, austin, bradford, hill, proposed, a, series, of, considerations, to, help, assess, evidence, of, causation, which, have, come, to, be, commonly, known, as, the, bradford, hill, criteria, in, contrast, to, the, explicit, intentions, of, their, author, hill, s, considerations, are, now, sometimes, taught, as, a, checklist, to, be, implemented, for, assessing, causality, hill, himself, said, none, of, my, nine, viewpoints, can, bring, indisputable, evidence, for, or, against, the, cause, and, effect, hypothesis, and, none, can, be, required, sine, qua, non, epidemiological, studies, can, only, go, to, prove, that, an, agent, could, have, caused, but, not, that, it, did, cause, an, effect, in, any, particular, case, epidemiology, is, concerned, with, the, incidence, of, disease, in, populations, and, does, not, address, the, question, of, the, cause, of, an, individual, s, disease, this, question, sometimes, referred, to, as, specific, causation, is, beyond, the, domain, of, the, science, of, epidemiology, epidemiology, has, its, limits, at, the, point, where, an, inference, is, made, that, the, relationship, between, an, agent, and, a, disease, is, causal, general, causation, and, where, the, magnitude, of, excess, risk, attributed, to, the, agent, has, been, determined, that, is, epidemiology, addresses, whether, an, agent, can, cause, disease, not, whether, an, agent, did, cause, a, specific, plaintiff, s, disease, in, united, states, law, epidemiology, alone, cannot, prove, that, a, causal, association, does, not, exist, in, general, conversely, it, can, be, and, is, in, some, circumstances, taken, by, us, courts, in, an, individual, case, to, justify, an, inference, that, a, causal, association, does, exist, based, upon, a, balance, of, probability, the, subdiscipline, of, forensic, epidemiology, is, directed, at, the, investigation, of, specific, causation, of, disease, or, injury, in, individuals, or, groups, of, individuals, in, instances, in, which, causation, is, disputed, or, is, unclear, for, presentation, in, legal, settings, epidemiological, practice, and, the, results, of, epidemiological, analysis, make, a, significant, contribution, to, emerging, population, based, health, management, frameworks, population, based, health, management, encompasses, the, ability, to, modern, population, based, health, management, is, complex, requiring, a, multiple, set, of, skills, medical, political, technological, mathematical, etc, of, which, epidemiological, practice, and, analysis, is, a, core, component, that, is, unified, with, management, science, to, provide, efficient, and, effective, health, care, and, health, guidance, to, a, population, this, task, requires, the, forward, looking, ability, of, modern, risk, management, approaches, that, transform, health, risk, factors, incidence, prevalence, and, mortality, statistics, derived, from, epidemiological, analysis, into, management, metrics, that, not, only, guide, how, a, health, system, responds, to, current, population, health, issues, but, also, how, a, health, system, can, be, managed, to, better, respond, to, future, potential, population, health, issues, examples, of, organizations, that, use, population, based, health, management, that, leverage, the, work, and, results, of, epidemiological, practice, include, canadian, strategy, for, cancer, control, health, canada, tobacco, control, programs, rick, hansen, foundation, canadian, tobacco, control, research, initiative, each, of, these, organizations, uses, a, population, based, health, management, framework, called, life, at, risk, that, combines, epidemiological, quantitative, analysis, with, demographics, health, agency, operational, research, and, economics, to, perform, applied, epidemiology, is, the, practice, of, using, epidemiological, methods, to, protect, or, improve, the, health, of, a, population, applied, field, epidemiology, can, include, investigating, communicable, and, non, communicable, disease, outbreaks, mortality, and, morbidity, rates, and, nutritional, status, among, other, indicators, of, health, with, the, purpose, of, communicating, the, results, to, those, who, can, implement, appropriate, policies, or, disease, control, measures, as, the, surveillance, and, reporting, of, diseases, and, other, health, factors, become, increasingly, difficult, in, humanitarian, crisis, situations, the, methodologies, used, to, report, the, data, are, compromised, one, study, found, that, less, than, half, 42, 4, of, nutrition, surveys, sampled, from, humanitarian, contexts, correctly, calculated, the, prevalence, of, malnutrition, and, only, one, third, 35, 3, of, the, surveys, met, the, criteria, for, quality, among, the, mortality, surveys, only, 3, 2, met, the, criteria, for, quality, as, nutritional, status, and, mortality, rates, help, indicate, the, severity, of, a, crisis, the, tracking, and, reporting, of, these, health, factors, is, crucial, vital, registries, are, usually, the, most, effective, ways, to, collect, data, but, in, humanitarian, contexts, these, registries, can, be, non, existent, unreliable, or, inaccessible, as, such, mortality, is, often, inaccurately, measured, using, either, prospective, demographic, surveillance, or, retrospective, mortality, surveys, prospective, demographic, surveillance, requires, much, manpower, and, is, difficult, to, implement, in, a, spread, out, population, retrospective, mortality, surveys, are, prone, to, selection, and, reporting, biases, other, methods, are, being, developed, but, are, not, common, practice, yet, the, concept, of, waves, in, epidemics, has, implications, especially, for, communicable, diseases, a, working, definition, for, the, term, epidemic, wave, is, based, on, two, key, features, 1, it, comprises, periods, of, upward, or, downward, trends, and, 2, these, increases, or, decreases, must, be, substantial, and, sustained, over, a, period, of, time, in, order, to, distinguish, them, from, minor, fluctuations, or, reporting, errors, the, use, of, a, consistent, scientific, definition, is, to, provide, a, consistent, language, that, can, be, used, to, communicate, about, and, understand, the, progression, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, which, would, aid, healthcare, organizations, and, policymakers, in, resource, planning, and, allocation, different, fields, in, epidemiology, have, different, levels, of, validity, one, way, to, assess, the, validity, of, findings, is, the, ratio, of, false, positives, claimed, effects, that, are, not, correct, to, false, negatives, studies, which, fail, to, support, a, true, effect, in, genetic, epidemiology, candidate, gene, studies, may, produce, over, 100, false, positive, findings, for, each, false, negative, by, contrast, genome, wide, association, appear, close, to, the, reverse, with, only, one, false, positive, for, every, 100, or, more, false, negatives, this, ratio, has, improved, over, time, in, genetic, epidemiology, as, the, field, has, adopted, stringent, criteria, by, contrast, other, epidemiological, fields, have, not, required, such, rigorous, reporting, and, are, much, less, reliable, as, a, result, random, error, is, the, result, of, fluctuations, around, a, true, value, because, of, sampling, variability, random, error, is, just, that, random, it, can, occur, during, data, collection, coding, transfer, or, analysis, examples, of, random, errors, include, poorly, worded, questions, a, misunderstanding, in, interpreting, an, individual, answer, from, a, particular, respondent, or, a, typographical, error, during, coding, random, error, affects, measurement, in, a, transient, inconsistent, manner, and, it, is, impossible, to, correct, for, random, error, there, is, a, random, error, in, all, sampling, procedures, sampling, error, precision, in, epidemiological, variables, is, a, measure, of, random, error, precision, is, also, inversely, related, to, random, error, so, that, to, reduce, random, error, is, to, increase, precision, confidence, intervals, are, computed, to, demonstrate, the, precision, of, relative, risk, estimates, the, narrower, the, confidence, interval, the, more, precise, the, relative, risk, estimate, there, are, two, basic, ways, to, reduce, random, error, in, an, epidemiological, study, the, first, is, to, increase, the, sample, size, of, the, study, in, other, words, add, more, subjects, to, your, study, the, second, is, to, reduce, the, variability, in, measurement, in, the, study, this, might, be, accomplished, by, using, a, more, precise, measuring, device, or, by, increasing, the, number, of, measurements, note, that, if, sample, size, or, number, of, measurements, are, increased, or, a, more, precise, measuring, tool, is, purchased, the, costs, of, the, study, are, usually, increased, there, is, usually, an, uneasy, balance, between, the, need, for, adequate, precision, and, the, practical, issue, of, study, cost, a, systematic, error, or, bias, occurs, when, there, is, a, difference, between, the, true, value, in, the, population, and, the, observed, value, in, the, study, from, any, cause, other, than, sampling, variability, an, example, of, systematic, error, is, if, unknown, to, you, the, pulse, oximeter, you, are, using, is, set, incorrectly, and, adds, two, points, to, the, true, value, each, time, a, measurement, is, taken, the, measuring, device, could, be, precise, but, not, accurate, because, the, error, happens, in, every, instance, it, is, systematic, conclusions, you, draw, based, on, that, data, will, still, be, incorrect, but, the, error, can, be, reproduced, in, the, future, e, g, by, using, the, same, mis, set, instrument, a, mistake, in, coding, that, affects, all, responses, for, that, particular, question, is, another, example, of, a, systematic, error, the, validity, of, a, study, is, dependent, on, the, degree, of, systematic, error, validity, is, usually, separated, into, two, components, selection, bias, occurs, when, study, subjects, are, selected, or, become, part, of, the, study, as, a, result, of, a, third, unmeasured, variable, which, is, associated, with, both, the, exposure, and, outcome, of, interest, for, instance, it, has, repeatedly, been, noted, that, cigarette, smokers, and, non, smokers, tend, to, differ, in, their, study, participation, rates, sackett, d, cites, the, example, of, seltzer, et, al, in, which, 85, of, non, smokers, and, 67, of, smokers, returned, mailed, questionnaires, such, a, difference, in, response, will, not, lead, to, bias, if, it, is, not, also, associated, with, a, systematic, difference, in, outcome, between, the, two, response, groups, information, bias, is, bias, arising, from, systematic, error, in, the, assessment, of, a, variable, an, example, of, this, is, recall, bias, a, typical, example, is, again, provided, by, sackett, in, his, discussion, of, a, study, examining, the, effect, of, specific, exposures, on, fetal, health, in, questioning, mothers, whose, recent, pregnancies, had, ended, in, fetal, death, or, malformation, cases, and, a, matched, group, of, mothers, whose, pregnancies, ended, normally, controls, it, was, found, that, 28, of, the, former, but, only, 20, of, the, latter, reported, exposure, to, drugs, which, could, not, be, substantiated, either, in, earlier, prospective, interviews, or, in, other, health, records, in, this, example, recall, bias, probably, occurred, as, a, result, of, women, who, had, had, miscarriages, having, an, apparent, tendency, to, better, recall, and, therefore, report, previous, exposures, confounding, has, traditionally, been, defined, as, bias, arising, from, the, co, occurrence, or, mixing, of, effects, of, extraneous, factors, referred, to, as, confounders, with, the, main, effect, s, of, interest, a, more, recent, definition, of, confounding, invokes, the, notion, of, counterfactual, effects, according, to, this, view, when, one, observes, an, outcome, of, interest, say, y, 1, as, opposed, to, y, 0, in, a, given, population, a, which, is, entirely, exposed, i, e, exposure, x, 1, for, every, unit, of, the, population, the, risk, of, this, event, will, be, r, a1, the, counterfactual, or, unobserved, risk, r, a0, corresponds, to, the, risk, which, would, have, been, observed, if, these, same, individuals, had, been, unexposed, i, e, x, 0, for, every, unit, of, the, population, the, true, effect, of, exposure, therefore, is, r, a1, r, a0, if, one, is, interested, in, risk, differences, or, r, a1, r, a0, if, one, is, interested, in, relative, risk, since, the, counterfactual, risk, r, a0, is, unobservable, we, approximate, it, using, a, second, population, b, and, we, actually, measure, the, following, relations, r, a1, r, b0, or, r, a1, r, b0, in, this, situation, confounding, occurs, when, r, a0, r, b0, nb, example, assumes, binary, outcome, and, exposure, variables, some, epidemiologists, prefer, to, think, of, confounding, separately, from, common, categorizations, of, bias, since, unlike, selection, and, information, bias, confounding, stems, from, real, causal, effects, few, universities, have, offered, epidemiology, as, a, course, of, study, at, the, undergraduate, level, an, undergraduate, program, exists, at, johns, hopkins, university, in, which, students, who, major, in, public, health, can, take, graduate, level, courses, including, epidemiology, during, their, senior, year, at, the, bloomberg, school, of, public, health, in, addition, to, its, master, s, and, doctoral, degrees, in, epidemiology, the, university, of, michigan, school, of, public, health, has, offered, undergraduate, degree, programs, since, 2017, that, include, coursework, in, epidemiology, although, epidemiologic, research, is, conducted, by, individuals, from, diverse, disciplines, variable, levels, of, training, in, epidemiologic, methods, are, provided, during, pharmacy, medical, veterinary, social, work, podiatry, nursing, physical, therapy, and, clinical, psychology, doctoral, programs, in, addition, to, the, formal, training, master, s, and, doctoral, students, in, public, health, fields, receive, as, public, health, practitioners, epidemiologists, work, in, a, number, of, different, settings, some, epidemiologists, work, in, the, field, i, e, in, the, community, commonly, in, a, public, health, service, and, are, often, at, the, forefront, of, investigating, and, combating, disease, outbreaks, others, work, for, non, profit, organizations, universities, hospitals, or, larger, government, entities, e, g, state, and, local, health, departments, in, the, united, states, ministries, of, health, doctors, without, borders, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, the, health, protection, agency, the, world, health, organization, who, or, the, public, health, agency, of, canada, epidemiologists, can, also, work, in, for, profit, organizations, e, g, pharmaceutical, and, medical, device, companies, in, groups, such, as, market, research, or, clinical, development, an, april, 2020, university, of, southern, california, article, noted, that, the, coronavirus, epidemic, thrust, epidemiology, the, study, of, the, incidence, distribution, and, control, of, disease, in, a, population, to, the, forefront, of, scientific, disciplines, across, the, globe, and, even, made, temporary, celebrities, out, of, some, of, its, practitioners
