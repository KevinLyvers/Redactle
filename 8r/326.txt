a, herbivore, is, an, animal, anatomically, and, physiologically, evolved, to, feed, on, plants, especially, upon, vascular, tissues, such, as, foliage, fruits, or, seeds, as, the, main, component, of, its, diet, these, more, broadly, also, encompass, animals, that, eat, non, vascular, autotrophs, such, as, mosses, algae, and, lichens, but, do, not, include, those, feeding, on, decomposed, plant, matters, i, e, detritivores, or, macrofungi, i, e, fungivores, as, a, result, of, their, plant, based, diet, herbivorous, animals, typically, have, mouth, structures, jaws, or, mouthparts, well, adapted, to, mechanically, break, down, plant, materials, and, their, digestive, systems, have, special, enzymes, e, g, amylase, and, cellulase, to, digest, polysaccharides, grazing, herbivores, such, as, horses, and, cattles, have, wide, flat, crowned, teeth, that, are, better, adapted, for, grinding, grass, tree, bark, and, other, tougher, lignin, containing, materials, and, many, of, them, evolved, rumination, or, cecotropic, behaviors, to, better, extract, nutrients, from, plants, a, large, percentage, of, herbivores, also, have, mutualistic, gut, flora, made, up, of, bacteria, and, protozoans, that, help, to, degrade, the, cellulose, in, plants, whose, heavily, cross, linking, polymer, structure, makes, it, far, more, difficult, to, digest, than, the, protein, and, fat, rich, animal, tissues, that, carnivores, eat, herbivore, is, the, anglicized, form, of, a, modern, latin, coinage, herbivora, cited, in, charles, lyell, s, 1830, principles, of, geology, richard, owen, employed, the, anglicized, term, in, an, 1854, work, on, fossil, teeth, and, skeletons, herbivora, is, derived, from, latin, herba, small, plant, herb, and, vora, from, vorare, to, eat, devour, herbivory, is, a, form, of, consumption, in, which, an, organism, principally, eats, autotrophs, such, as, plants, algae, and, photosynthesizing, bacteria, more, generally, organisms, that, feed, on, autotrophs, in, general, are, known, as, primary, consumers, herbivory, is, usually, limited, to, animals, that, eat, plants, insect, herbivory, can, cause, a, variety, of, physical, and, metabolic, alterations, in, the, way, the, host, plant, interacts, with, itself, and, other, surrounding, biotic, factors, fungi, bacteria, and, protists, that, feed, on, living, plants, are, usually, termed, plant, pathogens, plant, diseases, while, fungi, and, microbes, that, feed, on, dead, plants, are, described, as, saprotrophs, flowering, plants, that, obtain, nutrition, from, other, living, plants, are, usually, termed, parasitic, plants, there, is, however, no, single, exclusive, and, definitive, ecological, classification, of, consumption, patterns, each, textbook, has, its, own, variations, on, the, theme, the, understanding, of, herbivory, in, geological, time, comes, from, three, sources, fossilized, plants, which, may, preserve, evidence, of, defence, such, as, spines, or, herbivory, related, damage, the, observation, of, plant, debris, in, fossilised, animal, faeces, and, the, construction, of, herbivore, mouthparts, although, herbivory, was, long, thought, to, be, a, mesozoic, phenomenon, fossils, have, shown, that, plants, were, being, consumed, by, arthropods, within, less, than, 20, million, years, after, the, first, land, plants, evolved, insects, fed, on, the, spores, of, early, devonian, plants, and, the, rhynie, chert, also, provides, evidence, that, organisms, fed, on, plants, using, a, pierce, and, suck, technique, during, the, next, 75, million, years, plants, evolved, a, range, of, more, complex, organs, such, as, roots, and, seeds, there, is, no, evidence, of, any, organism, being, fed, upon, until, the, middle, late, mississippian, 330, 9, million, years, ago, there, was, a, gap, of, 50, to, 100, million, years, between, the, time, each, organ, evolved, and, the, time, organisms, evolved, to, feed, upon, them, this, may, be, due, to, the, low, levels, of, oxygen, during, this, period, which, may, have, suppressed, evolution, further, than, their, arthropod, status, the, identity, of, these, early, herbivores, is, uncertain, hole, feeding, and, skeletonization, are, recorded, in, the, early, permian, with, surface, fluid, feeding, evolving, by, the, end, of, that, period, herbivory, among, four, limbed, terrestrial, vertebrates, the, tetrapods, developed, in, the, late, carboniferous, 307, 299, million, years, ago, early, tetrapods, were, large, amphibious, piscivores, while, amphibians, continued, to, feed, on, fish, and, insects, some, reptiles, began, exploring, two, new, food, types, tetrapods, carnivory, and, plants, herbivory, the, entire, dinosaur, order, ornithischia, was, composed, of, herbivorous, dinosaurs, carnivory, was, a, natural, transition, from, insectivory, for, medium, and, large, tetrapods, requiring, minimal, adaptation, in, contrast, a, complex, set, of, adaptations, was, necessary, for, feeding, on, highly, fibrous, plant, materials, arthropods, evolved, herbivory, in, four, phases, changing, their, approach, to, it, in, response, to, changing, plant, communities, tetrapod, herbivores, made, their, first, appearance, in, the, fossil, record, of, their, jaws, near, the, permio, carboniferous, boundary, approximately, 300, million, years, ago, the, earliest, evidence, of, their, herbivory, has, been, attributed, to, dental, occlusion, the, process, in, which, teeth, from, the, upper, jaw, come, in, contact, with, teeth, in, the, lower, jaw, is, present, the, evolution, of, dental, occlusion, led, to, a, drastic, increase, in, plant, food, processing, and, provides, evidence, about, feeding, strategies, based, on, tooth, wear, patterns, examination, of, phylogenetic, frameworks, of, tooth, and, jaw, morphologes, has, revealed, that, dental, occlusion, developed, independently, in, several, lineages, tetrapod, herbivores, this, suggests, that, evolution, and, spread, occurred, simultaneously, within, various, lineages, herbivores, form, an, important, link, in, the, food, chain, because, they, consume, plants, to, digest, the, carbohydrates, photosynthetically, produced, by, a, plant, carnivores, in, turn, consume, herbivores, for, the, same, reason, while, omnivores, can, obtain, their, nutrients, from, either, plants, or, animals, due, to, a, herbivore, s, ability, to, survive, solely, on, tough, and, fibrous, plant, matter, they, are, termed, the, primary, consumers, in, the, food, cycle, chain, herbivory, carnivory, and, omnivory, can, be, regarded, as, special, cases, of, consumer, resource, interactions, two, herbivore, feeding, strategies, are, grazing, e, g, cows, and, browsing, e, g, moose, for, a, terrestrial, mammal, to, be, called, a, grazer, at, least, 90, of, the, forage, has, to, be, grass, and, for, a, browser, at, least, 90, tree, leaves, and, twigs, an, intermediate, feeding, strategy, is, called, mixed, feeding, in, their, daily, need, to, take, up, energy, from, forage, herbivores, of, different, body, mass, may, be, selective, in, choosing, their, food, selective, means, that, herbivores, may, choose, their, forage, source, depending, on, e, g, season, or, food, availability, but, also, that, they, may, choose, high, quality, and, consequently, highly, nutritious, forage, before, lower, quality, the, latter, especially, is, determined, by, the, body, mass, of, the, herbivore, with, small, herbivores, selecting, for, high, quality, forage, and, with, increasing, body, mass, animals, are, less, selective, several, theories, attempt, to, explain, and, quantify, the, relationship, between, animals, and, their, food, such, as, kleiber, s, law, holling, s, disk, equation, and, the, marginal, value, theorem, see, below, kleiber, s, law, describes, the, relationship, between, an, animal, s, size, and, its, feeding, strategy, saying, that, larger, animals, need, to, eat, less, food, per, unit, weight, than, smaller, animals, kleiber, s, law, states, that, the, metabolic, rate, q, 0, of, an, animal, is, the, mass, of, the, animal, m, raised, to, the, 3, 4, power, q, 0, m, 3, 4, therefore, the, mass, of, the, animal, increases, at, a, faster, rate, than, the, metabolic, rate, herbivores, employ, numerous, types, of, feeding, strategies, many, herbivores, do, not, fall, into, one, specific, feeding, strategy, but, employ, several, strategies, and, eat, a, variety, of, plant, parts, optimal, foraging, theory, is, a, model, for, predicting, animal, behavior, while, looking, for, food, or, other, resources, such, as, shelter, or, water, this, model, assesses, both, individual, movement, such, as, animal, behavior, while, looking, for, food, and, distribution, within, a, habitat, such, as, dynamics, at, the, population, and, community, level, for, example, the, model, would, be, used, to, look, at, the, browsing, behavior, of, a, deer, while, looking, for, food, as, well, as, that, deer, s, specific, location, and, movement, within, the, forested, habitat, and, its, interaction, with, other, deer, while, in, that, habitat, this, model, has, been, criticized, as, circular, and, untestable, critics, have, pointed, out, that, its, proponents, use, examples, that, fit, the, theory, but, do, not, use, the, model, when, it, does, not, fit, the, reality, other, critics, point, out, that, animals, do, not, have, the, ability, to, assess, and, maximize, their, potential, gains, therefore, the, optimal, foraging, theory, is, irrelevant, and, derived, to, explain, trends, that, do, not, exist, in, nature, holling, s, disk, equation, models, the, efficiency, at, which, predators, consume, prey, the, model, predicts, that, as, the, number, of, prey, increases, the, amount, of, time, predators, spend, handling, prey, also, increases, and, therefore, the, efficiency, of, the, predator, decreases, in, 1959, s, holling, proposed, an, equation, to, model, the, rate, of, return, for, an, optimal, diet, rate, r, energy, gained, in, foraging, ef, time, searching, ts, time, handling, th, r, e, f, t, s, t, h, displaystyle, r, ef, ts, th, where, s, cost, of, search, per, unit, time, f, rate, of, encounter, with, items, h, handling, time, e, energy, gained, per, encounter, in, effect, this, would, indicate, that, a, herbivore, in, a, dense, forest, would, spend, more, time, handling, eating, the, vegetation, because, there, was, so, much, vegetation, around, than, a, herbivore, in, a, sparse, forest, who, could, easily, browse, through, the, forest, vegetation, according, to, the, holling, s, disk, equation, a, herbivore, in, the, sparse, forest, would, be, more, efficient, at, eating, than, the, herbivore, in, the, dense, forest, the, marginal, value, theorem, describes, the, balance, between, eating, all, the, food, in, a, patch, for, immediate, energy, or, moving, to, a, new, patch, and, leaving, the, plants, in, the, first, patch, to, regenerate, for, future, use, the, theory, predicts, that, absent, complicating, factors, an, animal, should, leave, a, resource, patch, when, the, rate, of, payoff, amount, of, food, falls, below, the, average, rate, of, payoff, for, the, entire, area, according, to, this, theory, an, animal, should, move, to, a, new, patch, of, food, when, the, patch, they, are, currently, feeding, on, requires, more, energy, to, obtain, food, than, an, average, patch, within, this, theory, two, subsequent, parameters, emerge, the, giving, up, density, gud, and, the, giving, up, time, gut, the, giving, up, density, gud, quantifies, the, amount, of, food, that, remains, in, a, patch, when, a, forager, moves, to, a, new, patch, the, giving, up, time, gut, is, used, when, an, animal, continuously, assesses, the, patch, quality, interactions, between, plants, and, herbivores, can, play, a, prevalent, role, in, ecosystem, dynamics, such, community, structure, and, functional, processes, plant, diversity, and, distribution, is, often, driven, by, herbivory, and, it, is, likely, that, trade, offs, between, plant, competitiveness, and, defensiveness, and, between, colonization, and, mortality, allow, for, coexistence, between, species, in, the, presence, of, herbivores, however, the, effects, of, herbivory, on, plant, diversity, and, richness, is, variable, for, example, increased, abundance, of, herbivores, such, as, deer, decrease, plant, diversity, and, species, richness, while, other, large, mammalian, herbivores, like, bison, control, dominant, species, which, allows, other, species, to, flourish, plant, herbivore, interactions, can, also, operate, so, that, plant, communities, mediate, herbivore, communities, plant, communities, that, are, more, diverse, typically, sustain, greater, herbivore, richness, by, providing, a, greater, and, more, diverse, set, of, resources, coevolution, and, phylogenetic, correlation, between, herbivores, and, plants, are, important, aspects, of, the, influence, of, herbivore, and, plant, interactions, on, communities, and, ecosystem, functioning, especially, in, regard, to, herbivorous, insects, this, is, apparent, in, the, adaptations, plants, develop, to, tolerate, and, or, defend, from, insect, herbivory, and, the, responses, of, herbivores, to, overcome, these, adaptations, the, evolution, of, antagonistic, and, mutualistic, plant, herbivore, interactions, are, not, mutually, exclusive, and, may, co, occur, plant, phylogeny, has, been, found, to, facilitate, the, colonization, and, community, assembly, of, herbivores, and, there, is, evidence, of, phylogenetic, linkage, between, plant, beta, diversity, and, phylogenetic, beta, diversity, of, insect, clades, such, as, butterflies, these, types, of, eco, evolutionary, feedbacks, between, plants, and, herbivores, are, likely, the, main, driving, force, behind, plant, and, herbivore, diversity, abiotic, factors, such, as, climate, and, biogeographical, features, also, impact, plant, herbivore, communities, and, interactions, for, example, in, temperate, freshwater, wetlands, herbivorous, waterfowl, communities, change, according, to, season, with, species, that, eat, above, ground, vegetation, being, abundant, during, summer, and, species, that, forage, below, ground, being, present, in, winter, months, these, seasonal, herbivore, communities, differ, in, both, their, assemblage, and, functions, within, the, wetland, ecosystem, such, differences, in, herbivore, modalities, can, potentially, lead, to, trade, offs, that, influence, species, traits, and, may, lead, to, additive, effects, on, community, composition, and, ecosystem, functioning, seasonal, changes, and, environmental, gradients, such, as, elevation, and, latitude, often, affect, the, palatability, of, plants, which, in, turn, influences, herbivore, community, assemblages, and, vice, versa, examples, include, a, decrease, in, abundance, of, leaf, chewing, larvae, in, the, fall, when, hardwood, leaf, palatability, decreases, due, to, increased, tannin, levels, which, results, in, a, decline, of, arthropod, species, richness, and, increased, palatability, of, plant, communities, at, higher, elevations, where, grasshoppers, abundances, are, lower, climatic, stressors, such, as, ocean, acidification, can, lead, to, responses, in, plant, herbivore, interactions, in, relation, to, palatability, as, well, the, myriad, defenses, displayed, by, plants, means, that, their, herbivores, need, a, variety, of, skills, to, overcome, these, defenses, and, obtain, food, these, allow, herbivores, to, increase, their, feeding, and, use, of, a, host, plant, herbivores, have, three, primary, strategies, for, dealing, with, plant, defenses, choice, herbivore, modification, and, plant, modification, feeding, choice, involves, which, plants, a, herbivore, chooses, to, consume, it, has, been, suggested, that, many, herbivores, feed, on, a, variety, of, plants, to, balance, their, nutrient, uptake, and, to, avoid, consuming, too, much, of, any, one, type, of, defensive, chemical, this, involves, a, tradeoff, however, between, foraging, on, many, plant, species, to, avoid, toxins, or, specializing, on, one, type, of, plant, that, can, be, detoxified, herbivore, modification, is, when, various, adaptations, to, body, or, digestive, systems, of, the, herbivore, allow, them, to, overcome, plant, defenses, this, might, include, detoxifying, secondary, metabolites, sequestering, toxins, unaltered, or, avoiding, toxins, such, as, through, the, production, of, large, amounts, of, saliva, to, reduce, effectiveness, of, defenses, herbivores, may, also, utilize, symbionts, to, evade, plant, defenses, for, example, some, aphids, use, bacteria, in, their, gut, to, provide, essential, amino, acids, lacking, in, their, sap, diet, plant, modification, occurs, when, herbivores, manipulate, their, plant, prey, to, increase, feeding, for, example, some, caterpillars, roll, leaves, to, reduce, the, effectiveness, of, plant, defenses, activated, by, sunlight, a, plant, defense, is, a, trait, that, increases, plant, fitness, when, faced, with, herbivory, this, is, measured, relative, to, another, plant, that, lacks, the, defensive, trait, plant, defenses, increase, survival, and, or, reproduction, fitness, of, plants, under, pressure, of, predation, from, herbivores, defense, can, be, divided, into, two, main, categories, tolerance, and, resistance, tolerance, is, the, ability, of, a, plant, to, withstand, damage, without, a, reduction, in, fitness, this, can, occur, by, diverting, herbivory, to, non, essential, plant, parts, resource, allocation, compensatory, growth, or, by, rapid, regrowth, and, recovery, from, herbivory, resistance, refers, to, the, ability, of, a, plant, to, reduce, the, amount, of, damage, it, receives, from, herbivores, this, can, occur, via, avoidance, in, space, or, time, physical, defenses, or, chemical, defenses, defenses, can, either, be, constitutive, always, present, in, the, plant, or, induced, produced, or, translocated, by, the, plant, following, damage, or, stress, physical, or, mechanical, defenses, are, barriers, or, structures, designed, to, deter, herbivores, or, reduce, intake, rates, lowering, overall, herbivory, thorns, such, as, those, found, on, roses, or, acacia, trees, are, one, example, as, are, the, spines, on, a, cactus, smaller, hairs, known, as, trichomes, may, cover, leaves, or, stems, and, are, especially, effective, against, invertebrate, herbivores, in, addition, some, plants, have, waxes, or, resins, that, alter, their, texture, making, them, difficult, to, eat, also, the, incorporation, of, silica, into, cell, walls, is, analogous, to, that, of, the, role, of, lignin, in, that, it, is, a, compression, resistant, structural, component, of, cell, walls, so, that, plants, with, their, cell, walls, impregnated, with, silica, are, thereby, afforded, a, measure, of, protection, against, herbivory, chemical, defenses, are, secondary, metabolites, produced, by, the, plant, that, deter, herbivory, there, are, a, wide, variety, of, these, in, nature, and, a, single, plant, can, have, hundreds, of, different, chemical, defenses, chemical, defenses, can, be, divided, into, two, main, groups, carbon, based, defenses, and, nitrogen, based, defenses, plants, have, also, changed, features, that, enhance, the, probability, of, attracting, natural, enemies, to, herbivores, some, emit, semiochemicals, odors, that, attract, natural, enemies, while, others, provide, food, and, housing, to, maintain, the, natural, enemies, presence, e, g, ants, that, reduce, herbivory, a, given, plant, species, often, has, many, types, of, defensive, mechanisms, mechanical, or, chemical, constitutive, or, induced, which, allow, it, to, escape, from, herbivores, according, to, the, theory, of, predator, prey, interactions, the, relationship, between, herbivores, and, plants, is, cyclic, when, prey, plants, are, numerous, their, predators, herbivores, increase, in, numbers, reducing, the, prey, population, which, in, turn, causes, predator, number, to, decline, the, prey, population, eventually, recovers, starting, a, new, cycle, this, suggests, that, the, population, of, the, herbivore, fluctuates, around, the, carrying, capacity, of, the, food, source, in, this, case, the, plant, several, factors, play, into, these, fluctuating, populations, and, help, stabilize, predator, prey, dynamics, for, example, spatial, heterogeneity, is, maintained, which, means, there, will, always, be, pockets, of, plants, not, found, by, herbivores, this, stabilizing, dynamic, plays, an, especially, important, role, for, specialist, herbivores, that, feed, on, one, species, of, plant, and, prevents, these, specialists, from, wiping, out, their, food, source, prey, defenses, also, help, stabilize, predator, prey, dynamics, and, for, more, information, on, these, relationships, see, the, section, on, plant, defenses, eating, a, second, prey, type, helps, herbivores, populations, stabilize, alternating, between, two, or, more, plant, types, provides, population, stability, for, the, herbivore, while, the, populations, of, the, plants, oscillate, this, plays, an, important, role, for, generalist, herbivores, that, eat, a, variety, of, plants, keystone, herbivores, keep, vegetation, populations, in, check, and, allow, for, a, greater, diversity, of, both, herbivores, and, plants, when, an, invasive, herbivore, or, plant, enters, the, system, the, balance, is, thrown, off, and, the, diversity, can, collapse, to, a, monotaxon, system, the, back, and, forth, relationship, of, plant, defense, and, herbivore, offense, drives, coevolution, between, plants, and, herbivores, resulting, in, a, coevolutionary, arms, race, the, escape, and, radiation, mechanisms, for, coevolution, presents, the, idea, that, adaptations, in, herbivores, and, their, host, plants, has, been, the, driving, force, behind, speciation, while, much, of, the, interaction, of, herbivory, and, plant, defense, is, negative, with, one, individual, reducing, the, fitness, of, the, other, some, is, beneficial, this, beneficial, herbivory, takes, the, form, of, mutualisms, in, which, both, partners, benefit, in, some, way, from, the, interaction, seed, dispersal, by, herbivores, and, pollination, are, two, forms, of, mutualistic, herbivory, in, which, the, herbivore, receives, a, food, resource, and, the, plant, is, aided, in, reproduction, plants, can, also, be, indirectly, affected, by, herbivores, through, nutrient, recycling, with, plants, benefiting, from, herbivores, when, nutrients, are, recycled, very, efficiently, another, form, of, plant, herbivore, mutualism, is, physical, changes, to, the, environment, and, or, plant, community, structure, by, herbivores, which, serve, as, ecosystem, engineers, such, as, wallowing, by, bison, swans, form, a, mutual, relationship, with, the, plant, species, that, they, forage, by, digging, and, disturbing, the, sediment, which, removes, competing, plants, and, subsequently, allows, colonization, of, other, plant, species, when, herbivores, are, affected, by, trophic, cascades, plant, communities, can, be, indirectly, affected, often, these, effects, are, felt, when, predator, populations, decline, and, herbivore, populations, are, no, longer, limited, which, leads, to, intense, herbivore, foraging, which, can, suppress, plant, communities, with, the, size, of, herbivores, having, an, effect, on, the, amount, of, energy, intake, that, is, needed, larger, herbivores, need, to, forage, on, higher, quality, or, more, plants, to, gain, the, optimal, amount, of, nutrients, and, energy, compared, to, smaller, herbivores, environmental, degradation, from, white, tailed, deer, odocoileus, virginianus, in, the, us, alone, has, the, potential, to, both, change, vegetative, communities, through, over, browsing, and, cost, forest, restoration, projects, upwards, of, 750, million, annually, another, example, of, a, trophic, cascade, involved, plant, herbivore, interactions, are, coral, reef, ecosystems, herbivorous, fish, and, marine, animals, are, important, algae, and, seaweed, grazers, and, in, the, absence, of, plant, eating, fish, corals, are, outcompeted, and, seaweeds, deprive, corals, of, sunlight, agricultural, crop, damage, by, the, same, species, totals,

generated, by, hunting, and, ecotourism, for, example, the, hunting, of, herbivorous, game, species, such, as, white, tailed, deer, cottontail, rabbits, antelope, and, elk, in, the, u, s, contributes, greatly, to, the, billion, dollar, annually, hunting, industry, ecotourism, is, a, major, source, of, revenue, particularly, in, africa, where, many, large, mammalian, herbivores, such, as, elephants, zebras, and, giraffes, help, to, bring, in, the, equivalent, of, millions, of, us, dollars, to, various, nations, annually
