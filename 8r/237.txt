pollination, is, the, transfer, of, pollen, from, an, anther, of, a, plant, to, the, stigma, of, a, plant, later, enabling, fertilisation, and, the, production, of, seeds, pollinating, agents, can, be, animals, such, as, insects, for, example, beetles, or, butterflies, birds, and, bats, water, wind, and, even, plants, themselves, pollinating, animals, travel, from, plant, to, plant, carrying, pollen, on, their, bodies, in, a, vital, interaction, that, allows, the, transfer, of, genetic, material, critical, to, the, reproductive, system, of, most, flowering, plants, when, self, pollination, occurs, within, a, closed, flower, pollination, often, occurs, within, a, species, when, pollination, occurs, between, species, it, can, produce, hybrid, offspring, in, nature, and, in, plant, breeding, work, in, angiosperms, after, the, pollen, grain, gametophyte, has, landed, on, the, stigma, it, germinates, and, develops, a, pollen, tube, which, grows, down, the, style, until, it, reaches, an, ovary, its, two, gametes, travel, down, the, tube, to, where, the, gametophyte, s, containing, the, female, gametes, are, held, within, the, carpel, after, entering, an, ovule, through, the, micropyle, one, male, nucleus, fuses, with, the, polar, bodies, to, produce, the, endosperm, tissues, while, the, other, fuses, with, the, egg, cell, to, produce, the, embryo, hence, the, term, double, fertilisation, this, process, would, result, in, the, production, of, a, seed, made, of, both, nutritious, tissues, and, embryo, in, gymnosperms, the, ovule, is, not, contained, in, a, carpel, but, exposed, on, the, surface, of, a, dedicated, support, organ, such, as, the, scale, of, a, cone, so, that, the, penetration, of, carpel, tissue, is, unnecessary, details, of, the, process, vary, according, to, the, division, of, gymnosperms, in, question, two, main, modes, of, fertilisation, are, found, in, gymnosperms, cycads, and, ginkgo, have, motile, sperm, that, swim, directly, to, the, egg, inside, the, ovule, whereas, conifers, and, gnetophytes, have, sperm, that, are, unable, to, swim, but, are, conveyed, to, the, egg, along, a, pollen, tube, the, study, of, pollination, spans, many, disciplines, such, as, botany, horticulture, entomology, and, ecology, the, pollination, process, as, an, interaction, between, flower, and, pollen, vector, was, first, addressed, in, the, 18th, century, by, christian, konrad, sprengel, it, is, important, in, horticulture, and, agriculture, because, fruiting, is, dependent, on, fertilisation, the, result, of, pollination, the, study, of, pollination, by, insects, is, known, as, anthecology, there, are, also, studies, in, economics, that, look, at, the, positives, and, negatives, of, pollination, focused, on, bees, and, how, the, process, affects, the, pollinators, themselves, pollen, germination, has, three, stages, hydration, activation, and, pollen, tube, emergence, the, pollen, grain, is, severely, dehydrated, so, that, its, mass, is, reduced, enabling, it, to, be, more, easily, transported, from, flower, to, flower, germination, only, takes, place, after, rehydration, ensuring, that, premature, germination, does, not, take, place, in, the, anther, hydration, allows, the, plasma, membrane, of, the, pollen, grain, to, reform, into, its, normal, bilayer, organization, providing, an, effective, osmotic, membrane, activation, involves, the, development, of, actin, filaments, throughout, the, cytoplasm, of, the, cell, which, eventually, become, concentrated, at, the, point, from, which, the, pollen, tube, will, emerge, hydration, and, activation, continue, as, the, pollen, tube, begins, to, grow, in, conifers, the, reproductive, structures, are, borne, on, cones, the, cones, are, either, pollen, cones, male, or, ovulate, cones, female, but, some, species, are, monoecious, and, others, dioecious, a, pollen, cone, contains, hundreds, of, microsporangia, carried, on, or, borne, on, reproductive, structures, called, sporophylls, spore, mother, cells, in, the, microsporangia, divide, by, meiosis, to, form, haploid, microspores, that, develop, further, by, two, mitotic, divisions, into, immature, male, gametophytes, pollen, grains, the, four, resulting, cells, consist, of, a, large, tube, cell, that, forms, the, pollen, tube, a, generative, cell, that, will, produce, two, sperm, by, mitosis, and, two, prothallial, cells, that, degenerate, these, cells, comprise, a, very, reduced, microgametophyte, that, is, contained, within, the, resistant, the, pollen, grains, are, dispersed, by, the, wind, to, the, female, ovulate, cone, that, is, made, up, of, many, overlapping, scales, sporophylls, and, thus, megasporophylls, each, protecting, two, ovules, each, of, which, consists, of, a, megasporangium, the, nucellus, wrapped, in, two, layers, of, tissue, the, integument, and, the, cupule, that, were, derived, from, highly, modified, branches, of, ancestral, gymnosperms, when, a, pollen, grain, lands, close, enough, to, the, tip, of, an, ovule, it, is, drawn, in, through, the, micropyle, a, pore, in, the, integuments, covering, the, tip, of, the, ovule, often, by, means, of, a, drop, of, liquid, known, as, a, pollination, drop, the, pollen, enters, a, pollen, chamber, close, to, the, nucellus, and, there, it, may, wait, for, a, year, before, it, germinates, and, forms, a, pollen, tube, that, grows, through, the, wall, of, the, megasporangium, nucellus, where, fertilisation, takes, place, during, this, time, the, megaspore, mother, cell, divides, by, meiosis, to, form, four, haploid, cells, three, of, which, degenerate, the, surviving, one, develops, as, a, megaspore, and, divides, repeatedly, to, form, an, immature, female, gametophyte, egg, sac, two, or, three, archegonia, containing, an, egg, then, develop, inside, the, gametophyte, meanwhile, in, the, spring, of, the, second, year, two, sperm, cells, are, produced, by, mitosis, of, the, body, cell, of, the, male, gametophyte, the, pollen, tube, elongates, and, pierces, and, grows, through, the, megasporangium, wall, and, delivers, the, sperm, cells, to, the, female, gametophyte, inside, fertilisation, takes, place, when, the, nucleus, of, one, of, the, sperm, cells, enters, the, egg, cell, in, the, megagametophyte, s, archegonium, in, flowering, plants, the, anthers, of, the, flower, produce, microspores, by, meiosis, these, undergo, mitosis, to, form, male, gametophytes, each, of, which, contains, two, haploid, cells, meanwhile, the, ovules, produce, megaspores, by, meiosis, further, division, of, these, form, the, female, gametophytes, which, are, very, strongly, reduced, each, consisting, only, of, a, few, cells, one, of, which, is, the, egg, when, a, pollen, grain, adheres, to, the, stigma, of, a, carpel, it, germinates, developing, a, pollen, tube, that, grows, through, the, tissues, of, the, style, entering, the, ovule, through, the, micropyle, when, the, tube, reaches, the, egg, sac, two, sperm, cells, pass, through, it, into, the, female, gametophyte, and, fertilisation, takes, place, pollination, may, be, biotic, or, abiotic, biotic, pollination, relies, on, living, pollinators, to, move, the, pollen, from, one, flower, to, another, abiotic, pollination, relies, on, wind, water, or, even, rain, adding, natural, habitat, areas, into, farm, systems, generally, improves, pollination, as, farms, that, are, closer, to, natural, habitat, have, higher, crop, yield, because, they, are, visited, by, more, pollinators, about, 80, of, angiosperms, rely, on, biotic, pollination, also, called, pollen, vectors, organisms, that, carry, or, move, the, pollen, grains, from, the, anther, of, one, flower, to, the, receptive, part, of, the, carpel, or, pistil, stigma, of, another, between, 100, 000, and, 200, 000, species, of, animal, act, as, pollinators, of, the, world, s, 250, 000, species, of, flowering, plant, the, majority, of, these, pollinators, are, insects, but, about, 1, 500, species, of, birds, and, mammals, visit, flowers, and, may, transfer, pollen, between, them, besides, birds, and, bats, which, are, the, most, frequent, visitors, these, include, monkeys, lemurs, squirrels, rodents, and, possums, entomophily, pollination, by, insects, often, occurs, on, plants, that, have, developed, colored, petals, and, a, strong, scent, to, attract, insects, such, as, bees, wasps, and, occasionally, ants, hymenoptera, beetles, coleoptera, moths, and, butterflies, lepidoptera, and, flies, diptera, the, existence, of, insect, pollination, dates, back, to, the, dinosaur, era, insect, pollinators, such, as, honey, bees, apis, spp, bumblebees, bombus, spp, and, butterflies, e, g, thymelicus, flavus, have, been, observed, to, engage, in, flower, constancy, which, means, they, are, more, likely, to, transfer, pollen, to, other, conspecific, plants, this, can, be, beneficial, for, the, pollinators, as, flower, constancy, prevents, the, loss, of, pollen, during, interspecific, flights, and, pollinators, from, clogging, stigmas, with, pollen, of, other, flower, species, it, also, improves, the, probability, that, the, pollinator, will, find, productive, flowers, easily, accessible, and, recognisable, by, familiar, clues, the, primary, insect, pollinators, are, hymenopterans, mostly, bees, but, also, including, sawflies, ants, and, many, species, of, wasps, many, flowers, attract, pollinators, by, odor, for, example, orchid, bee, species, such, as, euglossa, cordata, are, attracted, to, orchids, this, way, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, some, orchid, species, intoxicate, bees, during, visits, which, can, last, up, to, 90, minutes, however, in, general, plants, that, rely, on, pollen, vectors, tend, to, be, adapted, to, their, particular, type, of, vector, for, example, day, pollinated, species, tend, to, be, brightly, coloured, and, have, little, odor, but, if, they, are, pollinated, largely, by, birds, or, specialist, mammals, they, tend, to, be, larger, and, have, larger, nectar, rewards, than, species, that, are, strictly, insect, pollinated, night, blooming, flowers, have, little, color, but, are, often, very, aromatic, plants, with, vertebrate, pollinators, also, tend, to, spread, their, rewards, over, longer, periods, having, long, flowering, seasons, their, specialist, pollinators, would, be, likely, to, starve, if, the, pollination, season, were, too, short, some, flowers, have, specialized, mechanisms, to, trap, pollinators, to, increase, effectiveness, attach, pollen, to, specific, body, parts, as, happens, in, many, orchid, and, asclepias, species, or, require, specialized, behaviors, or, morphology, in, order, to, extract, pollen, or, nectar, one, such, syndrome, is, buzz, pollination, or, sonication, where, a, bee, must, vibrate, at, a, certain, frequency, in, order, to, cause, pollen, to, be, released, from, the, anthers, in, zoophily, pollination, is, performed, by, vertebrates, such, as, birds, and, bats, particularly, hummingbirds, sunbirds, spiderhunters, honeyeaters, and, fruit, bats, ornithophily, or, bird, pollination, is, the, pollination, of, flowering, plants, by, birds, chiropterophily, or, bat, pollination, is, the, pollination, of, flowering, plants, by, bats, plants, adapted, to, use, bats, or, moths, as, pollinators, typically, have, white, petals, strong, scent, and, flower, at, night, whereas, plants, that, use, birds, as, pollinators, tend, to, produce, copious, nectar, and, have, red, petals, mammals, are, not, generally, thought, of, as, pollinators, but, some, rodents, bats, and, marsupials, are, significant, pollinators, and, some, even, specialise, in, such, activities, in, south, africa, certain, species, of, protea, in, particular, protea, humiflora, p, amplexicaulis, p, subulifolia, p, decurrens, and, p, cordata, are, adapted, to, pollination, by, rodents, particularly, cape, spiny, mouse, acomys, subspinosus, and, elephant, shrews, elephantulus, species, the, flowers, are, borne, near, the, ground, are, yeasty, smelling, not, colourful, and, sunbirds, reject, the, nectar, with, its, high, xylose, content, the, mice, apparently, can, digest, the, xylose, and, they, eat, large, quantities, of, the, pollen, in, australia, pollination, by, flying, gliding, and, earthbound, mammals, has, been, demonstrated, reptile, pollinators, are, known, but, they, form, a, minority, in, most, ecological, situations, they, are, most, frequent, and, most, ecologically, significant, in, island, systems, where, insect, and, sometimes, also, bird, populations, may, be, unstable, and, less, species, rich, adaptation, to, a, lack, of, animal, food, and, of, predation, pressure, might, therefore, favour, reptiles, becoming, more, herbivorous, and, more, inclined, to, feed, on, pollen, and, nectar, most, species, of, lizards, in, the, families, that, seem, to, be, significant, in, pollination, seem, to, carry, pollen, only, incidentally, especially, the, larger, species, such, as, varanidae, and, iguanidae, but, especially, several, species, of, the, gekkonidae, are, active, pollinators, and, so, is, at, least, one, species, of, the, lacertidae, podarcis, lilfordi, which, pollinates, various, species, but, in, particular, is, the, major, pollinator, of, euphorbia, dendroides, on, various, mediterranean, islands, abiotic, pollination, uses, nonliving, methods, such, as, wind, and, water, to, move, pollen, from, one, flower, to, another, this, allows, the, plant, to, spend, energy, directly, on, pollen, rather, than, on, attracting, pollinators, with, flowers, and, nectar, pollination, by, wind, is, more, common, amongst, abiotic, pollination, some, 98, of, abiotic, pollination, is, anemophily, i, e, pollination, by, wind, this, probably, arose, from, insect, pollination, entomophily, most, likely, due, to, changes, in, the, environment, or, the, availability, of, pollinators, the, transfer, of, pollen, is, more, efficient, than, previously, thought, wind, pollinated, plants, have, developed, to, have, specific, heights, in, addition, to, specific, floral, stamen, and, stigma, positions, that, promote, effective, pollen, dispersal, and, transfer, pollination, by, water, hydrophily, uses, water, to, transport, pollen, sometimes, as, whole, anthers, these, can, travel, across, the, surface, of, the, water, to, carry, dry, pollen, from, one, flower, to, another, in, vallisneria, spiralis, an, unopened, male, flower, floats, to, the, surface, of, the, water, and, upon, reaching, the, surface, opens, up, and, the, fertile, anthers, project, forward, the, female, flower, also, floating, has, its, stigma, protected, from, the, water, while, its, sepals, are, slightly, depressed, into, the, water, allowing, the, male, flowers, to, tumble, in, rain, pollination, is, used, by, a, small, percentage, of, plants, heavy, rain, discourages, insect, pollination, and, damages, unprotected, flowers, but, can, itself, disperse, pollen, of, suitably, adapted, plants, such, as, ranunculus, flammula, narthecium, ossifragum, and, caltha, palustris, in, these, plants, excess, rain, drains, allowing, the, floating, pollen, to, come, in, contact, with, the, stigma, in, some, orchids, ombrophily, occurs, and, rain, water, splashes, cause, the, anther, cap, to, be, removed, allowing, for, the, pollen, to, be, exposed, after, exposure, raindrops, causes, the, pollen, to, be, shot, upward, when, the, stipe, pulls, them, back, and, then, fall, into, the, cavity, of, the, stigma, thus, for, the, orchid, acampe, rigida, this, allows, the, plant, to, self, pollinate, which, is, useful, when, biotic, pollinators, in, the, environment, have, decreased, it, is, possible, for, a, plant, to, have, varying, pollination, methods, including, both, biotic, and, abiotic, pollination, the, orchid, oeceoclades, maculata, uses, both, rain, and, butterflies, depending, on, its, environmental, conditions, pollination, can, be, accomplished, by, cross, pollination, or, by, self, pollination, an, estimated, 48, 7, of, plant, species, are, either, dioecious, or, self, incompatible, obligate, out, crossers, it, is, also, estimated, that, about, 42, of, flowering, plants, have, a, mixed, mating, system, in, nature, in, the, most, common, kind, of, mixed, mating, system, individual, plants, produce, a, single, type, of, flower, and, fruits, may, contain, self, pollinated, out, crossed, or, a, mixture, of, progeny, types, pollination, also, requires, consideration, of, pollenizers, the, plants, that, serve, as, the, pollen, source, for, other, plants, some, plants, are, self, compatible, self, fertile, and, can, pollinate, and, fertilize, themselves, other, plants, have, chemical, or, physical, barriers, to, self, pollination, in, agriculture, and, horticulture, pollination, management, a, good, pollenizer, is, a, plant, that, provides, compatible, viable, and, plentiful, pollen, and, blooms, at, the, same, time, as, the, plant, that, is, to, be, pollinated, or, has, pollen, that, can, be, stored, and, used, when, needed, to, pollinate, the, desired, flowers, hybridization, is, effective, pollination, between, flowers, of, different, species, or, between, different, breeding, lines, or, populations, see, also, heterosis, peaches, are, considered, self, fertile, because, a, commercial, crop, can, be, produced, without, cross, pollination, though, cross, pollination, usually, gives, a, better, crop, apples, are, considered, self, incompatible, because, a, commercial, crop, must, be, cross, pollinated, many, commercial, fruit, tree, varieties, are, grafted, clones, genetically, identical, an, orchard, block, of, apples, of, one, variety, is, genetically, a, single, plant, many, growers, now, consider, this, a, mistake, one, means, of, correcting, this, mistake, is, to, graft, a, limb, of, an, appropriate, pollenizer, generally, a, variety, of, crabapple, every, six, trees, or, so, the, first, fossil, record, for, abiotic, pollination, is, from, fern, like, plants, in, the, late, carboniferous, period, gymnosperms, show, evidence, for, biotic, pollination, as, early, as, the, triassic, period, many, fossilized, pollen, grains, show, characteristics, similar, to, the, biotically, dispersed, pollen, today, furthermore, the, gut, contents, wing, structures, and, mouthpart, morphology, of, fossilized, beetles, and, flies, suggest, that, they, acted, as, early, pollinators, the, association, between, beetles, and, angiosperms, during, the, early, cretaceous, period, led, to, parallel, radiations, of, angiosperms, and, insects, into, the, late, cretaceous, the, evolution, of, nectaries, in, late, cretaceous, flowers, signals, the, beginning, of, the, mutualism, between, hymenopterans, and, angiosperms, bees, provide, a, good, example, of, the, mutualism, that, exists, between, hymenopterans, and, angiosperms, flowers, provide, bees, with, nectar, an, energy, source, and, pollen, a, source, of, protein, when, bees, go, from, flower, to, flower, collecting, pollen, they, are, also, depositing, pollen, grains, onto, the, flowers, thus, pollinating, them, while, pollen, and, nectar, in, most, cases, are, the, most, notable, reward, attained, from, flowers, bees, also, visit, flowers, for, other, resources, such, as, oil, fragrance, resin, and, even, waxes, it, has, been, estimated, that, bees, originated, with, the, origin, or, diversification, of, angiosperms, in, addition, cases, of, coevolution, between, bee, species, and, flowering, plants, have, been, illustrated, by, specialized, adaptations, for, example, long, legs, are, selected, for, in, rediviva, neliana, a, bee, that, collects, oil, from, diascia, capsularis, which, have, long, spur, lengths, that, are, selected, for, in, order, to, deposit, pollen, on, the, oil, collecting, bee, which, in, turn, selects, for, even, longer, legs, in, r, neliana, and, again, longer, spur, length, in, d, capsularis, is, selected, for, thus, continually, driving, each, other, s, evolution, the, most, essential, staple, food, crops, on, the, planet, like, wheat, maize, rice, soybeans, and, sorghum, are, wind, pollinated, or, self, pollinating, when, considering, the, top, 15, crops, contributing, to, the, human, diet, globally, in, 2013, slightly, over, 10, of, the, total, human, diet, of, plant, crops, 211, out, of, 1916, kcal, person, day, is, dependent, upon, insect, pollination, pollination, management, is, a, branch, of, agriculture, that, seeks, to, protect, and, enhance, present, pollinators, and, often, involves, the, culture, and, addition, of, pollinators, in, monoculture, situations, such, as, commercial, fruit, orchards, the, largest, managed, pollination, event, in, the, world, is, in, california, almond, orchards, where, nearly, half, about, one, million, hives, of, the, us, honey, bees, are, trucked, to, the, almond, orchards, each, spring, new, york, s, apple, crop, requires, about, 30, 000, hives, maine, s, blueberry, crop, uses, about, 50, 000, hives, each, year, the, us, solution, to, the, pollinator, shortage, so, far, has, been, for, commercial, beekeepers, to, become, pollination, contractors, and, to, migrate, just, as, the, combine, harvesters, follow, the, wheat, harvest, from, texas, to, manitoba, beekeepers, follow, the, bloom, from, south, to, north, to, provide, pollination, for, many, different, crops, in, america, bees, are, brought, to, commercial, plantings, of, cucumbers, squash, melons, strawberries, and, many, other, crops, honey, bees, are, not, the, only, managed, pollinators, a, few, other, species, of, bees, are, also, raised, as, pollinators, the, alfalfa, leafcutter, bee, is, an, important, pollinator, for, alfalfa, seed, in, western, united, states, and, canada, bumblebees, are, increasingly, raised, and, used, extensively, for, greenhouse, tomatoes, and, other, crops, the, ecological, and, financial, importance, of, natural, pollination, by, insects, to, agricultural, crops, improving, their, quality, and, quantity, becomes, more, and, more, appreciated, and, has, given, rise, to, new, financial, opportunities, the, vicinity, of, a, forest, or, wild, grasslands, with, native, pollinators, near, agricultural, crops, such, as, apples, almonds, or, coffee, can, improve, their, yield, by, about, 20, the, benefits, of, native, pollinators, may, result, in, forest, owners, demanding, payment, for, their, contribution, in, the, improved, crop, results, a, simple, example, of, the, economic, value, of, ecological, services, farmers, can, also, raise, native, crops, in, order, to, promote, native, bee, pollinator, species, as, shown, with, the, native, sweat, bees, l, vierecki, in, delaware, and, l, leucozonium, in, southwest, virginia, the, american, institute, of, biological, sciences, reports, that, native, insect, pollination, saves, the, united, states, agricultural, economy, nearly, an, estimated, 3, 1, billion, annually, through, natural, crop, production, pollination, produces, some, 40, billion, worth, of, products, annually, in, the, united, states, alone, pollination, of, food, crops, has, become, an, environmental, issue, due, to, two, trends, the, trend, to, monoculture, means, that, greater, concentrations, of, pollinators, are, needed, at, bloom, time, than, ever, before, yet, the, area, is, forage, poor, or, even, deadly, to, bees, for, the, rest, of, the, season, the, other, trend, is, the, decline, of, pollinator, populations, due, to, pesticide, misuse, and, overuse, new, diseases, and, parasites, of, bees, clearcut, logging, decline, of, beekeeping, suburban, development, removal, of, hedges, and, other, habitat, from, farms, and, public, concern, about, bees, widespread, aerial, spraying, for, mosquitoes, due, to, west, nile, fears, is, causing, an, acceleration, of, the, loss, of, pollinators, changes, in, land, use, harmful, pesticides, and, advancing, climate, change, threaten, wild, pollinators, key, insect, species, that, increase, yields, of, three, fourths, of, crop, varieties, and, are, critical, to, growing, healthy, foods, in, some, situations, farmers, or, horticulturists, may, aim, to, restrict, natural, pollination, to, only, permit, breeding, with, the, preferred, individuals, plants, this, may, be, achieved, through, the, use, of, pollination, bags, in, some, instances, growers, demand, for, beehives, far, exceeds, the, available, supply, the, number, of, managed, beehives, in, the, us, has, steadily, declined, from, close, to, 6, million, after, wwii, to, less, than, 2, 5, million, today, in, contrast, the, area, dedicated, to, growing, bee, pollinated, crops, has, grown, over, 300, in, the, same, time, period, additionally, in, the, past, five, years, there, has, been, a, decline, in, winter, managed, beehives, which, has, reached, an, unprecedented, rate, of, colony, losses, at, near, 30, at, present, there, is, an, enormous, demand, for, beehive, rentals, that, cannot, always, be, met, there, is, a, clear, need, across, the, agricultural, industry, for, a, management, tool, to, draw, pollinators, into, cultivations, and, encourage, them, to, preferentially, visit, and, pollinate, the, flowering, crop, by, attracting, pollinators, like, honey, bees, and, increasing, their, foraging, behavior, particularly, in, the, center, of, large, plots, we, can, increase, grower, returns, and, optimize, yield, from, their, plantings, isca, technologies, from, riverside, california, created, a, semiochemical, formulation, called, splat, bloom, that, modifies, the, behavior, of, honey, bees, inciting, them, to, visit, flowers, in, every, portion, of, the, field, loss, of, pollinators, also, known, as, pollinator, decline, of, which, colony, collapse, disorder, is, perhaps, the, most, well, known, has, been, noticed, in, recent, years, these, loss, of, pollinators, have, caused, a, disturbance, in, early, plant, regeneration, processes, such, as, seed, dispersal, and, pollination, early, processes, of, plant, regeneration, greatly, depend, on, plant, animal, interactions, and, because, these, interactions, are, interrupted, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, functioning, are, threatened, pollination, by, animals, aids, in, the, genetic, variability, and, diversity, within, plants, because, it, allows, for, out, crossing, instead, for, self, crossing, without, this, genetic, diversity, there, would, be, a, lack, of, traits, for, natural, selection, to, act, on, for, the, survival, of, the, plant, species, seed, dispersal, is, also, important, for, plant, fitness, because, it, allows, plants, the, ability, to, expand, their, populations, more, than, that, it, permits, plants, to, escape, environments, that, have, changed, and, have, become, difficult, to, reside, in, all, of, these, factors, show, the, importance, of, pollinators, for, plants, which, are, a, significant, part, of, the, foundation, for, a, stable, ecosystem, if, only, a, few, species, of, plants, depended, on, loss, of, pollinators, is, especially, devastating, because, there, are, so, many, plant, species, rely, on, them, more, than, 87, 5, of, angiosperms, over, 75, of, tropical, tree, species, and, 30, 40, of, tree, species, in, temperate, regions, depend, on, pollination, and, seed, dispersal, factors, that, contribute, to, pollinator, decline, include, habitat, destruction, pesticide, parasitism, diseases, and, climate, change, the, more, destructive, forms, of, human, disturbances, are, land, use, changes, such, as, fragmentation, selective, logging, and, the, conversion, to, secondary, forest, habitat, defaunation, of, frugivores, is, also, an, important, driver, these, alterations, are, especially, harmful, due, to, the, sensitivity, of, the, pollination, process, of, plants, research, on, tropical, palms, found, that, defaunation, has, caused, a, decline, in, seed, dispersal, which, causes, a, decrease, in, genetic, variability, in, this, species, habitat, destruction, such, as, fragmentation, and, selective, logging, remove, areas, that, are, most, optimal, for, the, different, types, of, pollinators, which, removes, pollinators, food, resources, nesting, sites, and, leads, to, isolation, of, populations, the, effect, of, pesticides, on, pollinators, has, been, debated, because, it, is, difficult, to, determine, that, a, single, pesticide, is, the, cause, as, opposed, to, a, mixture, or, other, threats, whether, exposure, alone, causes, damage, or, if, the, duration, and, potency, are, also, factors, is, unknown, however, insecticides, have, negative, effects, as, in, the, case, of, neonicotinoids, that, harm, bee, colonies, many, researchers, believe, it, is, the, synergistic, effects, of, these, factors, which, are, ultimately, detrimental, to, pollinator, populations, in, the, agriculture, industry, climate, change, is, causing, a, pollinator, crisis, this, crisis, is, affecting, the, production, of, crops, and, the, relating, costs, due, to, a, decrease, in, pollination, processes, this, disturbance, can, be, phenological, or, spatial, in, the, first, case, species, that, normally, occur, in, similar, seasons, or, time, cycles, now, have, different, responses, to, environmental, changes, and, therefore, no, longer, interact, for, example, a, tree, may, flower, sooner, than, usual, while, the, pollinator, may, reproduce, later, in, the, year, and, therefore, the, two, species, no, longer, coincide, in, time, spatial, disturbances, occur, when, two, species, that, would, normally, share, the, same, distribution, now, respond, differently, to, climate, change, and, are, shifting, to, different, regions, the, most, known, and, understood, pollinator, bees, have, been, used, as, the, prime, example, of, the, decline, in, pollinators, bees, are, essential, in, the, pollination, of, agricultural, crops, and, wild, plants, and, are, one, of, the, main, insects, that, perform, this, task, out, of, the, bees, species, the, honey, bee, or, apis, mellifera, has, been, studied, the, most, and, in, the, united, states, there, has, been, a, loss, of, 59, of, colonies, from, 1947, to, 2005, the, decrease, in, populations, of, the, honey, bee, have, been, attributed, to, pesticides, genetically, modified, crops, fragmentation, parasites, and, diseases, that, have, been, introduced, there, has, been, a, focus, on, neonicotinoids, effects, on, honey, bee, populations, neonicotinoids, insecticides, have, been, used, due, to, its, low, mammalian, toxicity, target, specificity, low, application, rates, and, broad, spectrum, activity, however, the, insecticides, are, able, to, make, its, way, throughout, the, plant, which, includes, the, pollen, and, nectar, due, to, this, it, has, been, shown, to, effect, on, the, nervous, system, and, colony, relations, in, the, honey, bee, populations, butterflies, too, have, suffered, due, to, these, modifications, butterflies, are, helpful, ecological, indicators, since, they, are, sensitive, to, changes, within, the, environment, like, the, season, altitude, and, above, all, human, impact, on, the, environment, butterfly, populations, were, higher, within, the, natural, forest, and, were, lower, in, open, land, the, reason, for, the, difference, in, density, is, the, fact, that, in, open, land, the, butterflies, would, be, exposed, to, desiccation, and, predation, these, open, regions, are, caused, by, habitat, destruction, like, logging, for, timber, livestock, grazing, and, firewood, collection, due, to, this, destruction, butterfly, species, diversity, can, decrease, and, it, is, known, that, there, is, a, correlation, in, butterfly, diversity, and, plant, diversity, besides, the, imbalance, of, the, ecosystem, caused, by, the, decline, in, pollinators, it, may, jeopardise, food, security, pollination, is, necessary, for, plants, to, continue, their, populations, and, 3, 4, of, the, plant, species, that, contribute, to, the, world, s, food, supply, are, plants, that, require, pollinators, insect, pollinators, like, bees, are, large, contributors, to, crop, production, over, 200, billion, dollars, worth, of, crop, species, are, pollinated, by, these, insects, pollinators, are, also, essential, because, they, improve, crop, quality, and, increase, genetic, diversity, which, is, necessary, in, producing, fruit, with, nutritional, value, and, various, flavors, crops, that, do, not, depend, on, animals, for, pollination, but, on, the, wind, or, self, pollination, like, corn, and, potatoes, have, doubled, in, production, and, make, up, a, large, part, of, the, human, diet, but, do, not, provide, the, micronutrients, that, are, needed, the, essential, nutrients, that, are, necessary, in, the, human, diet, are, present, in, plants, that, rely, on, animal, pollinators, there, have, been, issues, in, vitamin, and, mineral, deficiencies, and, it, is, believed, that, if, pollinator, populations, continue, to, decrease, these, deficiencies, will, become, even, more, prominent, wild, pollinators, often, visit, a, large, number, of, plant, species, and, plants, are, visited, by, a, large, number, of, pollinator, species, all, these, relations, together, form, a, network, of, interactions, between, plants, and, pollinators, surprising, similarities, were, found, in, the, structure, of, networks, consisting, out, of, the, interactions, between, plants, and, pollinators, this, structure, was, found, to, be, similar, in, very, different, ecosystems, on, different, continents, consisting, of, entirely, different, species, the, structure, of, plant, pollinator, networks, may, have, large, consequences, for, the, way, in, which, pollinator, communities, respond, to, increasingly, harsh, conditions, mathematical, models, examining, the, consequences, of, this, network, structure, for, the, stability, of, pollinator, communities, suggest, that, the, specific, way, in, which, plant, pollinator, networks, are, organized, minimizes, competition, between, pollinators, and, may, even, lead, to, strong, indirect, facilitation, between, pollinators, when, conditions, are, harsh, this, means, that, pollinator, species, together, can, survive, under, harsh, conditions, but, it, also, means, that, pollinator, species, collapse, simultaneously, when, conditions, pass, a, critical, point, this, simultaneous, collapse, occurs, because, pollinator, species, depend, on, each, other, when, surviving, under, difficult, conditions, such, a, community, wide, collapse, involving, many, pollinator, species, can, occur, suddenly, when, increasingly, harsh, conditions, pass, a, critical, point, and, recovery, from, such, a, collapse, might, not, be, easy, the, improvement, in, conditions, needed, for, pollinators, to, recover, could, be, substantially, larger, than, the, improvement, needed, to, return, to, conditions, at, which, the, pollinator, community, collapsed, while, there, are, 200, 000, 350, 000, different, species, of, animals, that, help, pollination, honeybees, are, responsible, for, majority, of, the, pollination, for, consumed, crops, providing, between, 235, and, 577, us, billion, of, benefits, to, global, food, production, the, western, honey, bee, apis, mellifera, l, provides, highly, valued, pollination, services, for, a, wide, variety, of, agricultural, crops, and, ranks, as, the, most, frequent, single, species, of, pollinator, for, crops, worldwide, since, the, early, 1900s, beekeepers, in, the, united, states, started, renting, out, their, colonies, to, farmers, to, increase, the, farmer, s, crop, yields, earning, additional, revenue, from, providing, privatized, pollination, as, of, 2016, 41, of, an, average, us, beekeeper, s, revenue, comes, from, providing, such, pollination, service, to, farmers, making, it, the, biggest, proportion, of, their, income, with, the, rest, coming, from, sales, of, honey, beeswax, government, subsidy, etc, this, is, an, example, of, how, a, positive, externality, pollination, of, crops, from, beekeeping, and, honey, making, was, successfully, accounted, for, and, incorporated, into, the, overall, market, for, agriculture, on, top, of, assisting, food, production, pollination, service, provide, beneficial, spillovers, as, bees, germinate, not, only, the, crops, but, also, other, plants, around, the, area, that, they, are, set, loose, to, pollinate, increasing, biodiversity, for, the, local, ecosystem, there, is, even, further, spillover, as, biodiversity, increases, ecosystem, resistance, for, wildlife, and, crops, due, to, their, role, of, pollination, in, crop, production, commercial, honeybees, are, considered, to, be, livestock, by, the, us, department, of, agriculture, the, impact, of, pollination, varies, by, crop, for, example, almond, production, in, the, united, states, an, 11, billion, industry, based, almost, exclusively, in, the, state, of, california, is, heavily, dependent, on, imported, honeybees, for, pollination, of, almond, trees, almond, industry, uses, up, to, 82, of, the, services, in, the, pollination, market, each, february, around, 60, of, the, all, bee, colonies, in, the, us, are, moved, to, california, s, central, valley, over, the, past, decade, beekeepers, across, the, us, have, reported, that, the, mortality, rate, of, their, bee, colonies, has, stayed, constant, at, about, 30, every, year, making, the, deaths, an, expected, cost, of, business, for, the, beekeepers, while, the, exact, cause, of, this, phenomenon, is, unknown, according, to, the, us, department, of, agriculture, colony, collapse, disorder, progress, report, it, can, be, traced, to, factors, such, as, pollution, pesticides, and, pathogens, from, evidences, found, in, areas, of, the, colonies, affected, and, the, colonies, themselves, pollution, and, pesticides, are, detrimental, to, the, health, of, the, bees, and, their, colonies, as, the, bees, ability, to, pollinate, and, return, to, their, colonies, are, great, greatly, compromised, moreover, california, s, central, valley, is, determined, by, the, world, health, organization, as, the, location, of, country, s, worst, air, pollution, almond, pollinating, bees, approximately, 60, of, the, bees, in, the, us, as, mentioned, above, will, be, mixed, with, bees, from, thousands, of, other, hives, provided, by, different, beekeepers, making, them, exponentially, susceptible, to, diseases, and, mites, that, any, of, them, could, be, carrying, the, deaths, do, not, stop, at, commercial, honeybees, as, there, is, evidence, of, significant, pathogen, spillover, to, other, pollinators, including, wild, bumble, bees, infecting, up, to, 35, 100, of, wild, bees, within, 2, km, radius, of, commercial, pollination, the, negative, externality, of, private, pollination, services, is, the, decline, of, biodiversity, through, the, deaths, of, commercial, and, wild, bees, despite, losing, about, a, third, of, their, workforce, every, year, beekeepers, continue, to, rent, out, their, bees, to, almond, farms, due, to, the, high, pay, from, the, almond, industry, in, 2016, a, colony, rented, out, for, almond, pollination, gave, beekeepers, an, income, of, 165, per, colony, rented, around, three, times, from, average, of, other, crops, that, use, the, pollination, rental, service, however, a, recent, study, published, in, oxford, academic, s, journal, of, economic, entomology, found, that, once, the, costs, for, maintaining, bees, specifically, for, almond, pollination, including, overwintering, summer, management, and, the, replacement, dying, bees, are, considered, almond, pollination, is, barely, or, not, profitable, for, average, beekeepers
