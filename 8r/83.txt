the, cerebellum, pl, cerebella, or, cerebellums, latin, for, little, brain, is, a, major, feature, of, the, hindbrain, of, all, vertebrates, although, usually, smaller, than, the, cerebrum, in, some, animals, such, as, the, mormyrid, fishes, it, may, be, as, large, as, it, or, even, larger, in, humans, the, cerebellum, plays, an, important, role, in, motor, control, and, cognitive, functions, such, as, attention, and, language, as, well, as, emotional, control, such, as, regulating, fear, and, pleasure, responses, but, its, movement, related, functions, are, the, most, solidly, established, the, human, cerebellum, does, not, initiate, movement, but, contributes, to, coordination, precision, and, accurate, timing, it, receives, input, from, sensory, systems, of, the, spinal, cord, and, from, other, parts, of, the, brain, and, integrates, these, inputs, to, fine, tune, motor, activity, cerebellar, damage, produces, disorders, in, fine, movement, equilibrium, posture, and, motor, learning, in, humans, anatomically, the, human, cerebellum, has, the, appearance, of, a, separate, structure, attached, to, the, bottom, of, the, brain, tucked, underneath, the, cerebral, hemispheres, its, cortical, surface, is, covered, with, finely, spaced, parallel, grooves, in, striking, contrast, to, the, broad, irregular, convolutions, of, the, cerebral, cortex, these, parallel, grooves, conceal, the, fact, that, the, cerebellar, cortex, is, actually, a, continuous, thin, layer, of, tissue, tightly, folded, in, the, style, of, an, accordion, within, this, thin, layer, are, several, types, of, neurons, with, a, highly, regular, arrangement, the, most, important, being, purkinje, cells, and, granule, cells, this, complex, neural, organization, gives, rise, to, a, massive, signal, processing, capability, but, almost, all, of, the, output, from, the, cerebellar, cortex, passes, through, a, set, of, small, deep, nuclei, lying, in, the, white, matter, interior, of, the, cerebellum, in, addition, to, its, direct, role, in, motor, control, the, cerebellum, is, necessary, for, several, types, of, motor, learning, most, notably, learning, to, adjust, to, changes, in, sensorimotor, relationships, several, theoretical, models, have, been, developed, to, explain, sensorimotor, calibration, in, terms, of, synaptic, plasticity, within, the, cerebellum, these, models, derive, from, those, formulated, by, david, marr, and, james, albus, based, on, the, observation, that, each, cerebellar, purkinje, cell, receives, two, dramatically, different, types, of, input, one, comprises, thousands, of, weak, inputs, from, the, parallel, fibers, of, the, granule, cells, the, other, is, an, extremely, strong, input, from, a, single, climbing, fiber, the, basic, concept, of, the, marr, albus, theory, is, that, the, climbing, fiber, serves, as, a, teaching, signal, which, induces, a, long, lasting, change, in, the, strength, of, parallel, fiber, inputs, observations, of, long, term, depression, in, parallel, fiber, inputs, have, provided, some, support, for, theories, of, this, type, but, their, validity, remains, controversial, at, the, level, of, gross, anatomy, the, cerebellum, consists, of, a, tightly, folded, layer, of, cortex, with, white, matter, underneath, and, a, fluid, filled, ventricle, at, the, base, four, deep, cerebellar, nuclei, are, embedded, in, the, white, matter, each, part, of, the, cortex, consists, of, the, same, small, set, of, neuronal, elements, laid, out, in, a, highly, stereotyped, geometry, at, an, intermediate, level, the, cerebellum, and, its, auxiliary, structures, can, be, separated, into, several, hundred, or, thousand, independently, functioning, modules, called, microzones, or, microcompartments, the, cerebellum, is, located, in, the, posterior, cranial, fossa, the, fourth, ventricle, pons, and, medulla, are, in, front, of, the, cerebellum, it, is, separated, from, the, overlying, cerebrum, by, a, layer, of, leathery, dura, mater, the, cerebellar, tentorium, all, of, its, connections, with, other, parts, of, the, brain, travel, through, the, pons, anatomists, classify, the, cerebellum, as, part, of, the, metencephalon, which, also, includes, the, pons, the, metencephalon, is, the, upper, part, of, the, rhombencephalon, or, hindbrain, like, the, cerebral, cortex, the, cerebellum, is, divided, into, two, cerebellar, hemispheres, it, also, contains, a, narrow, midline, zone, the, vermis, a, set, of, large, folds, is, by, convention, used, to, divide, the, overall, structure, into, 10, smaller, lobules, because, of, its, large, number, of, tiny, granule, cells, the, cerebellum, contains, more, neurons, than, the, total, from, the, rest, of, the, brain, but, takes, up, only, 10, of, the, total, brain, volume, the, number, of, neurons, in, the, cerebellum, is, related, to, the, number, of, neurons, in, the, neocortex, there, are, about, 3, 6, times, as, many, neurons, in, the, cerebellum, as, in, the, neocortex, a, ratio, that, is, conserved, across, many, different, mammalian, species, the, unusual, surface, appearance, of, the, cerebellum, conceals, the, fact, that, most, of, its, volume, is, made, up, of, a, very, tightly, folded, layer, of, gray, matter, the, cerebellar, cortex, each, ridge, or, gyrus, in, this, layer, is, called, a, folium, high, resolution, mri, finds, the, adult, human, cerebellar, cortex, has, an, area, of, 730, square, cm, packed, within, a, volume, of, dimensions, 6, cm, 5, cm, 10, cm, underneath, the, gray, matter, of, the, cortex, lies, white, matter, made, up, largely, of, myelinated, nerve, fibers, running, to, and, from, the, cortex, embedded, within, the, white, matter, which, is, sometimes, called, the, arbor, vitae, tree, of, life, because, of, its, branched, tree, like, appearance, in, cross, section, are, four, deep, cerebellar, nuclei, composed, of, gray, matter, connecting, the, cerebellum, to, different, parts, of, the, nervous, system, are, three, paired, cerebellar, peduncles, these, are, the, superior, cerebellar, peduncle, the, middle, cerebellar, peduncle, and, the, inferior, cerebellar, peduncle, named, by, their, position, relative, to, the, vermis, the, superior, cerebellar, peduncle, is, mainly, an, output, to, the, cerebral, cortex, carrying, efferent, fibers, via, thalamic, nuclei, to, upper, motor, neurons, in, the, cerebral, cortex, the, fibers, arise, from, the, deep, cerebellar, nuclei, the, middle, cerebellar, peduncle, is, connected, to, the, pons, and, receives, all, of, its, input, from, the, pons, mainly, from, the, pontine, nuclei, the, input, to, the, pons, is, from, the, cerebral, cortex, and, is, relayed, from, the, pontine, nuclei, via, transverse, pontine, fibers, to, the, cerebellum, the, middle, peduncle, is, the, largest, of, the, three, and, its, afferent, fibers, are, grouped, into, three, separate, fascicles, taking, their, inputs, to, different, parts, of, the, cerebellum, the, inferior, cerebellar, peduncle, receives, input, from, afferent, fibers, from, the, vestibular, nuclei, spinal, cord, and, the, tegmentum, output, from, the, inferior, peduncle, is, via, efferent, fibers, to, the, vestibular, nuclei, and, the, reticular, formation, the, whole, of, the, cerebellum, receives, modulatory, input, from, the, inferior, olivary, nucleus, via, the, inferior, cerebellar, peduncle, based, on, the, surface, appearance, three, lobes, can, be, distinguished, within, the, cerebellum, the, anterior, lobe, above, the, primary, fissure, the, posterior, lobe, below, the, primary, fissure, and, the, flocculonodular, lobe, below, the, posterior, fissure, these, lobes, divide, the, cerebellum, from, rostral, to, caudal, in, humans, top, to, bottom, in, terms, of, function, however, there, is, a, more, important, distinction, along, the, medial, to, lateral, dimension, leaving, out, the, flocculonodular, lobe, which, has, distinct, connections, and, functions, the, cerebellum, can, be, parsed, functionally, into, a, medial, sector, called, the, spinocerebellum, and, a, larger, lateral, sector, called, the, cerebrocerebellum, a, narrow, strip, of, protruding, tissue, along, the, midline, is, called, the, cerebellar, vermis, vermis, is, latin, for, worm, the, smallest, region, the, flocculonodular, lobe, is, often, called, the, vestibulocerebellum, it, is, the, oldest, part, in, evolutionary, terms, archicerebellum, and, participates, mainly, in, balance, and, spatial, orientation, its, primary, connections, are, with, the, vestibular, nuclei, although, it, also, receives, visual, and, other, sensory, input, damage, to, this, region, causes, disturbances, of, balance, and, gait, the, medial, zone, of, the, anterior, and, posterior, lobes, constitutes, the, spinocerebellum, also, known, as, paleocerebellum, this, sector, of, the, cerebellum, functions, mainly, to, fine, tune, body, and, limb, movements, it, receives, proprioceptive, input, from, the, dorsal, columns, of, the, spinal, cord, including, the, spinocerebellar, tract, and, from, the, cranial, trigeminal, nerve, as, well, as, from, visual, and, auditory, systems, it, sends, fibers, to, deep, cerebellar, nuclei, that, in, turn, project, to, both, the, cerebral, cortex, and, the, brain, stem, thus, providing, modulation, of, descending, motor, systems, the, lateral, zone, which, in, humans, is, by, far, the, largest, part, constitutes, the, cerebrocerebellum, also, known, as, neocerebellum, it, receives, input, exclusively, from, the, cerebral, cortex, especially, the, parietal, lobe, via, the, pontine, nuclei, forming, cortico, ponto, cerebellar, pathways, and, sends, output, mainly, to, the, ventrolateral, thalamus, in, turn, connected, to, motor, areas, of, the, premotor, cortex, and, primary, motor, area, of, the, cerebral, cortex, and, to, the, red, nucleus, there, is, disagreement, about, the, best, way, to, describe, the, functions, of, the, lateral, cerebellum, it, is, thought, to, be, involved, in, planning, movement, that, is, about, to, occur, in, evaluating, sensory, information, for, action, and, in, a, number, of, purely, cognitive, functions, such, as, determining, the, verb, which, best, fits, with, a, certain, noun, as, in, sit, for, chair, two, types, of, neuron, play, dominant, roles, in, the, cerebellar, circuit, purkinje, cells, and, granule, cells, three, types, of, axons, also, play, dominant, roles, mossy, fibers, and, climbing, fibers, which, enter, the, cerebellum, from, outside, and, parallel, fibers, which, are, the, axons, of, granule, cells, there, are, two, main, pathways, through, the, cerebellar, circuit, originating, from, mossy, fibers, and, climbing, fibers, both, eventually, terminating, in, the, deep, cerebellar, nuclei, mossy, fibers, project, directly, to, the, deep, nuclei, but, also, give, rise, to, the, following, pathway, mossy, fibers, granule, cells, parallel, fibers, purkinje, cells, deep, nuclei, climbing, fibers, project, to, purkinje, cells, and, also, send, collaterals, directly, to, the, deep, nuclei, the, mossy, fiber, and, climbing, fiber, inputs, each, carry, fiber, specific, information, the, cerebellum, also, receives, dopaminergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and, cholinergic, inputs, that, presumably, perform, global, modulation, the, cerebellar, cortex, is, divided, into, three, layers, at, the, bottom, lies, the, thick, granular, layer, densely, packed, with, granule, cells, along, with, interneurons, mainly, golgi, cells, but, also, including, lugaro, cells, and, unipolar, brush, cells, in, the, middle, lies, the, purkinje, layer, a, narrow, zone, that, contains, the, cell, bodies, of, purkinje, cells, and, bergmann, glial, cells, at, the, top, lies, the, molecular, layer, which, contains, the, flattened, dendritic, trees, of, purkinje, cells, along, with, the, huge, array, of, parallel, fibers, penetrating, the, purkinje, cell, dendritic, trees, at, right, angles, this, outermost, layer, of, the, cerebellar, cortex, also, contains, two, types, of, inhibitory, interneuron, stellate, cells, and, basket, cells, both, stellate, and, basket, cells, form, gabaergic, synapses, onto, purkinje, cell, dendrites, the, top, outermost, layer, of, the, cerebellar, cortex, is, the, molecular, layer, this, layer, contains, the, flattened, dendritic, trees, of, purkinje, cells, and, the, huge, array, of, parallel, fibers, from, the, granular, layer, that, penetrate, the, purkinje, cell, dendritic, trees, at, right, angles, the, molecular, layer, also, contains, two, types, of, inhibitory, interneuron, stellate, cells, and, basket, cells, both, stellate, and, basket, cells, form, gabaergic, synapses, onto, purkinje, cell, dendrites, purkinje, cells, are, among, the, most, distinctive, neurons, in, the, brain, and, one, of, the, earliest, types, to, be, recognized, they, were, first, described, by, the, czech, anatomist, jan, evangelista, purkyn, in, 1837, they, are, distinguished, by, the, shape, of, their, dendritic, tree, the, dendrites, branch, very, profusely, but, are, severely, flattened, in, a, plane, perpendicular, to, the, cerebellar, folds, thus, the, dendrites, of, a, purkinje, cell, form, a, dense, planar, net, through, which, parallel, fibers, pass, at, right, angles, the, dendrites, are, covered, with, dendritic, spines, each, of, which, receives, synaptic, input, from, a, parallel, fiber, purkinje, cells, receive, more, synaptic, inputs, than, any, other, type, of, cell, in, the, brain, estimates, of, the, number, of, spines, on, a, single, human, purkinje, cell, run, as, high, as, 200, 000, the, large, spherical, cell, bodies, of, purkinje, cells, are, packed, into, a, narrow, layer, one, cell, thick, of, the, cerebellar, cortex, called, the, purkinje, layer, after, emitting, collaterals, that, affect, nearby, parts, of, the, cortex, their, axons, travel, into, the, deep, cerebellar, nuclei, where, they, make, on, the, order, of, 1, 000, contacts, each, with, several, types, of, nuclear, cells, all, within, a, small, domain, purkinje, cells, use, gaba, as, their, neurotransmitter, and, therefore, exert, inhibitory, effects, on, their, targets, purkinje, cells, form, the, heart, of, the, cerebellar, circuit, and, their, large, size, and, distinctive, activity, patterns, have, made, it, relatively, easy, to, study, their, response, patterns, in, behaving, animals, using, extracellular, recording, techniques, purkinje, cells, normally, emit, action, potentials, at, a, high, rate, even, in, the, absence, of, the, synaptic, input, in, awake, behaving, animals, mean, rates, averaging, around, 40, hz, are, typical, the, spike, trains, show, a, mixture, of, what, are, called, simple, and, complex, spikes, a, simple, spike, is, a, single, action, potential, followed, by, a, refractory, period, of, about, 10, ms, a, complex, spike, is, a, stereotyped, sequence, of, action, potentials, with, very, short, inter, spike, intervals, and, declining, amplitudes, physiological, studies, have, shown, that, complex, spikes, which, occur, at, baseline, rates, around, 1, hz, and, never, at, rates, much, higher, than, 10, hz, are, reliably, associated, with, climbing, fiber, activation, while, simple, spikes, are, produced, by, a, combination, of, baseline, activity, and, parallel, fiber, input, complex, spikes, are, often, followed, by, a, pause, of, several, hundred, milliseconds, during, which, simple, spike, activity, is, suppressed, a, specific, recognizable, feature, of, purkinje, neurons, is, the, expression, of, calbindin, calbindin, staining, of, rat, brain, after, unilateral, chronic, sciatic, nerve, injury, suggests, that, purkinje, neurons, may, be, newly, generated, in, the, adult, brain, initiating, the, organization, of, new, cerebellar, lobules, cerebellar, granule, cells, in, contrast, to, purkinje, cells, are, among, the, smallest, neurons, in, the, brain, they, are, also, the, most, numerous, neurons, in, the, brain, in, humans, estimates, of, their, total, number, average, around, 50, billion, which, means, that, about, 3, 4, of, the, brain, s, neurons, are, cerebellar, granule, cells, their, cell, bodies, are, packed, into, a, thick, layer, at, the, bottom, of, the, cerebellar, cortex, a, granule, cell, emits, only, four, to, five, dendrites, each, of, which, ends, in, an, enlargement, called, a, dendritic, claw, these, enlargements, are, sites, of, excitatory, input, from, mossy, fibers, and, inhibitory, input, from, golgi, cells, the, thin, unmyelinated, axons, of, granule, cells, rise, vertically, to, the, upper, molecular, layer, of, the, cortex, where, they, split, in, two, with, each, branch, traveling, horizontally, to, form, a, parallel, fiber, the, splitting, of, the, vertical, branch, into, two, horizontal, branches, gives, rise, to, a, distinctive, t, shape, a, human, parallel, fiber, runs, for, an, average, of, 3, mm, in, each, direction, from, the, split, for, a, total, length, of, about, 6, mm, about, 1, 10, of, the, total, width, of, the, cortical, layer, as, they, run, along, the, parallel, fibers, pass, through, the, dendritic, trees, of, purkinje, cells, contacting, one, of, every, 3, 5, that, they, pass, making, a, total, of, 80, 100, synaptic, connections, with, purkinje, cell, dendritic, spines, granule, cells, use, glutamate, as, their, neurotransmitter, and, therefore, exert, excitatory, effects, on, their, targets, granule, cells, receive, all, of, their, input, from, mossy, fibers, but, outnumber, them, by, 200, to, 1, in, humans, thus, the, information, in, the, granule, cell, population, activity, state, is, the, same, as, the, information, in, the, mossy, fibers, but, recoded, in, a, much, more, expansive, way, because, granule, cells, are, so, small, and, so, densely, packed, it, is, difficult, to, record, their, spike, activity, in, behaving, animals, so, there, is, little, data, to, use, as, a, basis, for, theorizing, the, most, popular, concept, of, their, function, was, proposed, in, 1969, by, david, marr, who, suggested, that, they, could, encode, combinations, of, mossy, fiber, inputs, the, idea, is, that, with, each, granule, cell, receiving, input, from, only, 4, 5, mossy, fibers, a, granule, cell, would, not, respond, if, only, a, single, one, of, its, inputs, were, active, but, would, respond, if, more, than, one, were, active, this, combinatorial, coding, scheme, would, potentially, allow, the, cerebellum, to, make, much, finer, distinctions, between, input, patterns, than, the, mossy, fibers, alone, would, permit, mossy, fibers, enter, the, granular, layer, from, their, points, of, origin, many, arising, from, the, pontine, nuclei, others, from, the, spinal, cord, vestibular, nuclei, etc, in, the, human, cerebellum, the, total, number, of, mossy, fibers, has, been, estimated, at, 200, million, these, fibers, form, excitatory, synapses, with, the, granule, cells, and, the, cells, of, the, deep, cerebellar, nuclei, within, the, granular, layer, a, mossy, fiber, generates, a, series, of, enlargements, called, rosettes, the, contacts, between, mossy, fibers, and, granule, cell, dendrites, take, place, within, structures, called, glomeruli, each, glomerulus, has, a, mossy, fiber, rosette, at, its, center, and, up, to, 20, granule, cell, dendritic, claws, contacting, it, terminals, from, golgi, cells, infiltrate, the, structure, and, make, inhibitory, synapses, onto, the, granule, cell, dendrites, the, entire, assemblage, is, surrounded, by, a, sheath, of, glial, cells, each, mossy, fiber, sends, collateral, branches, to, several, cerebellar, folia, generating, a, total, of, 20, 30, rosettes, thus, a, single, mossy, fiber, makes, contact, with, an, estimated, 400, 600, granule, cells, purkinje, cells, also, receive, input, from, the, inferior, olivary, nucleus, on, the, contralateral, side, of, the, brainstem, via, climbing, fibers, although, the, inferior, olive, lies, in, the, medulla, oblongata, and, receives, input, from, the, spinal, cord, brainstem, and, cerebral, cortex, its, output, goes, entirely, to, the, cerebellum, a, climbing, fiber, gives, off, collaterals, to, the, deep, cerebellar, nuclei, before, entering, the, cerebellar, cortex, where, it, splits, into, about, 10, terminal, branches, each, of, which, gives, input, to, a, single, purkinje, cell, in, striking, contrast, to, the, 100, 000, plus, inputs, from, parallel, fibers, each, purkinje, cell, receives, input, from, exactly, one, climbing, fiber, but, this, single, fiber, climbs, the, dendrites, of, the, purkinje, cell, winding, around, them, and, making, a, total, of, up, to, 300, synapses, as, it, goes, the, net, input, is, so, strong, that, a, single, action, potential, from, a, climbing, fiber, is, capable, of, producing, an, extended, complex, spike, in, the, purkinje, cell, a, burst, of, several, spikes, in, a, row, with, diminishing, amplitude, followed, by, a, pause, during, which, activity, is, suppressed, the, climbing, fiber, synapses, cover, the, cell, body, and, proximal, dendrites, this, zone, is, devoid, of, parallel, fiber, inputs, climbing, fibers, fire, at, low, rates, but, a, single, climbing, fiber, action, potential, induces, a, burst, of, several, action, potentials, in, a, target, purkinje, cell, a, complex, spike, the, contrast, between, parallel, fiber, and, climbing, fiber, inputs, to, purkinje, cells, over, 100, 000, of, one, type, versus, exactly, one, of, the, other, type, is, perhaps, the, most, provocative, feature, of, cerebellar, anatomy, and, has, motivated, much, of, the, theorizing, in, fact, the, function, of, climbing, fibers, is, the, most, controversial, topic, concerning, the, cerebellum, there, are, two, schools, of, thought, one, following, marr, and, albus, in, holding, that, climbing, fiber, input, serves, primarily, as, a, teaching, signal, the, other, holding, that, its, function, is, to, shape, cerebellar, output, directly, both, views, have, been, defended, in, great, length, in, numerous, publications, in, the, words, of, one, review, in, trying, to, synthesize, the, various, hypotheses, on, the, function, of, the, climbing, fibers, one, has, the, sense, of, looking, at, a, drawing, by, escher, each, point, of, view, seems, to, account, for, a, certain, collection, of, findings, but, when, one, attempts, to, put, the, different, views, together, a, coherent, picture, of, what, the, climbing, fibers, are, doing, does, not, appear, for, the, majority, of, researchers, the, climbing, fibers, signal, errors, in, motor, performance, either, in, the, usual, manner, of, discharge, frequency, modulation, or, as, a, single, announcement, of, an, unexpected, event, for, other, investigators, the, message, lies, in, the, degree, of, ensemble, synchrony, and, rhythmicity, among, a, population, of, climbing, fibers, the, deep, nuclei, of, the, cerebellum, are, clusters, of, gray, matter, lying, within, the, white, matter, at, the, core, of, the, cerebellum, they, are, with, the, minor, exception, of, the, nearby, vestibular, nuclei, the, sole, sources, of, output, from, the, cerebellum, these, nuclei, receive, collateral, projections, from, mossy, fibers, and, climbing, fibers, as, well, as, inhibitory, input, from, the, purkinje, cells, of, the, cerebellar, cortex, the, four, nuclei, dentate, globose, emboliform, and, fastigial, each, communicate, with, different, parts, of, the, brain, and, cerebellar, cortex, the, globose, and, the, emboliform, nuclei, are, also, referred, to, as, combined, in, the, interposed, nucleus, the, fastigial, and, interposed, nuclei, belong, to, the, spinocerebellum, the, dentate, nucleus, which, in, mammals, is, much, larger, than, the, others, is, formed, as, a, thin, convoluted, layer, of, gray, matter, and, communicates, exclusively, with, the, lateral, parts, of, the, cerebellar, cortex, the, flocculus, of, the, flocculonodular, lobe, is, the, only, part, of, the, cerebellar, cortex, that, does, not, project, to, the, deep, nuclei, its, output, goes, to, the, vestibular, nuclei, instead, the, majority, of, neurons, in, the, deep, nuclei, have, large, cell, bodies, and, spherical, dendritic, trees, with, a, radius, of, about, 400, m, and, use, glutamate, as, their, neurotransmitter, these, cells, project, to, a, variety, of, targets, outside, the, cerebellum, intermixed, with, them, are, a, lesser, number, of, small, cells, which, use, gaba, as, a, neurotransmitter, and, project, exclusively, to, the, inferior, olivary, nucleus, the, source, of, climbing, fibers, thus, the, nucleo, olivary, projection, provides, an, inhibitory, feedback, to, match, the, excitatory, projection, of, climbing, fibers, to, the, nuclei, there, is, evidence, that, each, small, cluster, of, nuclear, cells, projects, to, the, same, cluster, of, olivary, cells, that, send, climbing, fibers, to, it, there, is, strong, and, matching, topography, in, both, directions, when, a, purkinje, cell, axon, enters, one, of, the, deep, nuclei, it, branches, to, make, contact, with, both, large, and, small, nuclear, cells, but, the, total, number, of, cells, contacted, is, only, about, 35, in, cats, conversely, a, single, deep, nuclear, cell, receives, input, from, approximately, 860, purkinje, cells, again, in, cats, from, the, viewpoint, of, gross, anatomy, the, cerebellar, cortex, appears, to, be, a, homogeneous, sheet, of, tissue, and, from, the, viewpoint, of, microanatomy, all, parts, of, this, sheet, appear, to, have, the, same, internal, structure, there, are, however, a, number, of, respects, in, which, the, structure, of, the, cerebellum, is, compartmentalized, there, are, large, compartments, that, are, generally, known, as, zones, these, can, be, divided, into, smaller, compartments, known, as, microzones, the, first, indications, of, compartmental, structure, came, from, studies, of, the, receptive, fields, of, cells, in, various, parts, of, the, cerebellar, cortex, each, body, part, maps, to, specific, points, in, the, cerebellum, but, there, are, numerous, repetitions, of, the, basic, map, forming, an, arrangement, that, has, been, called, fractured, somatotopy, a, clearer, indication, of, compartmentalization, is, obtained, by, immunostaining, the, cerebellum, for, certain, types, of, protein, the, best, known, of, these, markers, are, called, zebrins, because, staining, for, them, gives, rise, to, a, complex, pattern, reminiscent, of, the, stripes, on, a, zebra, the, stripes, generated, by, zebrins, and, other, compartmentalization, markers, are, oriented, perpendicular, to, the, cerebellar, folds, that, is, they, are, narrow, in, the, mediolateral, direction, but, much, more, extended, in, the, longitudinal, direction, different, markers, generate, different, sets, of, stripes, the, widths, and, lengths, vary, as, a, function, of, location, but, they, all, have, the, same, general, shape, oscarsson, in, the, late, 1970s, proposed, that, these, cortical, zones, can, be, partitioned, into, smaller, units, called, microzones, a, microzone, is, defined, as, a, group, of, purkinje, cells, all, having, the, same, somatotopic, receptive, field, microzones, were, found, to, contain, on, the, order, of, 1000, purkinje, cells, each, arranged, in, a, long, narrow, strip, oriented, perpendicular, to, the, cortical, folds, thus, as, the, adjoining, diagram, illustrates, purkinje, cell, dendrites, are, flattened, in, the, same, direction, as, the, microzones, extend, while, parallel, fibers, cross, them, at, right, angles, it, is, not, only, receptive, fields, that, define, the, microzone, structure, the, climbing, fiber, input, from, the, inferior, olivary, nucleus, is, equally, important, the, branches, of, a, climbing, fiber, usually, numbering, about, 10, usually, activate, purkinje, cells, belonging, to, the, same, microzone, moreover, olivary, neurons, that, send, climbing, fibers, to, the, same, microzone, tend, to, be, coupled, by, gap, junctions, which, synchronize, their, activity, causing, purkinje, cells, within, a, microzone, to, show, correlated, complex, spike, activity, on, a, millisecond, time, scale, also, the, purkinje, cells, belonging, to, a, microzone, all, send, their, axons, to, the, same, small, cluster, of, output, cells, within, the, deep, cerebellar, nuclei, finally, the, axons, of, basket, cells, are, much, longer, in, the, longitudinal, direction, than, in, the, mediolateral, direction, causing, them, to, be, confined, largely, to, a, single, microzone, the, consequence, of, all, this, structure, is, that, cellular, interactions, within, a, microzone, are, much, stronger, than, interactions, between, different, microzones, in, 2005, richard, apps, and, martin, garwicz, summarized, evidence, that, microzones, themselves, form, part, of, a, larger, entity, they, call, a, multizonal, microcomplex, such, a, microcomplex, includes, several, spatially, separated, cortical, microzones, all, of, which, project, to, the, same, group, of, deep, cerebellar, neurons, plus, a, group, of, coupled, olivary, neurons, that, project, to, all, of, the, included, microzones, as, well, as, to, the, deep, nuclear, area, the, cerebellum, is, provided, with, blood, from, three, paired, major, arteries, the, superior, cerebellar, artery, sca, the, anterior, inferior, cerebellar, artery, aica, and, the, posterior, inferior, cerebellar, artery, pica, the, sca, supplies, the, upper, region, of, the, cerebellum, it, divides, at, the, upper, surface, and, branches, into, the, pia, mater, where, the, branches, anastomose, with, those, of, the, anterior, and, posterior, inferior, cerebellar, arteries, the, aica, supplies, the, front, part, of, the, undersurface, of, the, cerebellum, the, pica, arrives, at, the, undersurface, where, it, divides, into, a, medial, branch, and, a, lateral, branch, the, medial, branch, continues, backward, to, the, cerebellar, notch, between, the, two, hemispheres, of, the, cerebellum, while, the, lateral, branch, supplies, the, under, surface, of, the, cerebellum, as, far, as, its, lateral, border, where, it, anastomoses, with, the, aica, and, the, sca, the, strongest, clues, to, the, function, of, the, cerebellum, have, come, from, examining, the, consequences, of, damage, to, it, animals, and, humans, with, cerebellar, dysfunction, show, above, all, problems, with, motor, control, on, the, same, side, of, the, body, as, the, damaged, part, of, the, cerebellum, they, continue, to, be, able, to, generate, motor, activity, but, lose, precision, producing, erratic, uncoordinated, or, incorrectly, timed, movements, a, standard, test, of, cerebellar, function, is, to, reach, with, the, tip, of, the, finger, for, a, target, at, arm, s, length, a, healthy, person, will, move, the, fingertip, in, a, rapid, straight, trajectory, whereas, a, person, with, cerebellar, damage, will, reach, slowly, and, erratically, with, many, mid, course, corrections, deficits, in, non, motor, functions, are, more, difficult, to, detect, thus, the, general, conclusion, reached, decades, ago, is, that, the, basic, function, of, the, cerebellum, is, to, calibrate, the, detailed, form, of, a, movement, not, to, initiate, movements, or, to, decide, which, movements, to, execute, prior, to, the, 1990s, the, function, of, the, cerebellum, was, almost, universally, believed, to, be, purely, motor, related, but, newer, findings, have, brought, that, view, into, question, functional, imaging, studies, have, shown, cerebellar, activation, in, relation, to, language, attention, and, mental, imagery, correlation, studies, have, shown, interactions, between, the, cerebellum, and, non, motor, areas, of, the, cerebral, cortex, and, a, variety, of, non, motor, symptoms, have, been, recognized, in, people, with, damage, that, appears, to, be, confined, to, the, cerebellum, in, particular, the, cerebellar, cognitive, affective, syndrome, or, schmahmann, s, syndrome, has, been, described, in, adults, and, children, estimates, based, on, functional, mapping, of, the, cerebellum, using, functional, mri, suggest, that, more, than, half, of, the, cerebellar, cortex, is, interconnected, with, association, zones, of, the, cerebral, cortex, kenji, doya, has, argued, that, the, cerebellum, s, function, is, best, understood, not, in, terms, of, the, behaviors, it, affects, but, the, neural, computations, it, performs, the, cerebellum, consists, of, a, large, number, of, more, or, less, independent, modules, all, with, the, same, geometrically, regular, internal, structure, and, therefore, all, it, is, presumed, performing, the, same, computation, if, the, input, and, output, connections, of, a, module, are, with, motor, areas, as, many, are, then, the, module, will, be, involved, in, motor, behavior, but, if, the, connections, are, with, areas, involved, in, non, motor, cognition, the, module, will, show, other, types, of, behavioral, correlates, thus, the, cerebellum, has, been, implicated, in, the, regulation, of, many, differing, functional, traits, such, as, affection, emotion, including, emotional, body, language, perception, and, behavior, the, cerebellum, doya, proposes, is, best, understood, as, predictive, action, selection, based, on, internal, models, of, the, environment, or, a, device, for, supervised, learning, in, contrast, to, the, basal, ganglia, which, perform, reinforcement, learning, and, the, cerebral, cortex, which, performs, unsupervised, learning, three, decades, of, brain, research, have, led, to, the, proposal, that, the, cerebellum, generates, optimized, mental, models, and, interacts, closely, with, the, cerebral, cortex, where, updated, internal, models, are, experienced, as, creative, intuition, a, ha, in, working, memory, the, comparative, simplicity, and, regularity, of, the, cerebellar, anatomy, led, to, an, early, hope, that, it, might, imply, a, similar, simplicity, of, computational, function, as, expressed, in, one, of, the, first, books, on, cerebellar, electrophysiology, the, cerebellum, as, a, neuronal, machine, by, john, c, eccles, masao, ito, and, j, nos, szent, gothai, although, a, full, understanding, of, cerebellar, function, has, remained, elusive, at, least, four, principles, have, been, identified, as, important, 1, feedforward, processing, 2, divergence, and, convergence, 3, modularity, and, 4, plasticity, there, is, considerable, evidence, that, the, cerebellum, plays, an, essential, role, in, some, types, of, motor, learning, the, tasks, where, the, cerebellum, most, clearly, comes, into, play, are, those, in, which, it, is, necessary, to, make, fine, adjustments, to, the, way, an, action, is, performed, there, has, however, been, much, dispute, about, whether, learning, takes, place, within, the, cerebellum, itself, or, whether, it, merely, serves, to, provide, signals, that, promote, learning, in, other, brain, structures, most, theories, that, assign, learning, to, the, circuitry, of, the, cerebellum, are, derived, from, the, ideas, of, david, marr, and, james, albus, who, postulated, that, climbing, fibers, provide, a, teaching, signal, that, induces, synaptic, modification, in, parallel, fiber, purkinje, cell, synapses, marr, assumed, that, climbing, fiber, input, would, cause, synchronously, activated, parallel, fiber, inputs, to, be, strengthened, most, subsequent, cerebellar, learning, models, however, have, followed, albus, in, assuming, that, climbing, fiber, activity, would, be, an, error, signal, and, would, cause, synchronously, activated, parallel, fiber, inputs, to, be, weakened, some, of, these, later, models, such, as, the, adaptive, filter, model, of, fujita, made, attempts, to, understand, cerebellar, function, in, terms, of, optimal, control, theory, the, idea, that, climbing, fiber, activity, functions, as, an, error, signal, has, been, examined, in, many, experimental, studies, with, some, supporting, it, but, others, casting, doubt, in, a, pioneering, study, by, gilbert, and, thach, from, 1977, purkinje, cells, from, monkeys, learning, a, reaching, task, showed, increased, complex, spike, activity, which, is, known, to, reliably, indicate, activity, of, the, cell, s, climbing, fiber, input, during, periods, when, performance, was, poor, several, studies, of, motor, learning, in, cats, observed, complex, spike, activity, when, there, was, a, mismatch, between, an, intended, movement, and, the, movement, that, was, actually, executed, studies, of, the, vestibulo, ocular, reflex, which, stabilizes, the, visual, image, on, the, retina, when, the, head, turns, found, that, climbing, fiber, activity, indicated, retinal, slip, although, not, in, a, very, straightforward, way, one, of, the, most, extensively, studied, cerebellar, learning, tasks, is, the, eyeblink, conditioning, paradigm, in, which, a, neutral, conditioned, stimulus, cs, such, as, a, tone, or, a, light, is, repeatedly, paired, with, an, unconditioned, stimulus, us, such, as, an, air, puff, that, elicits, a, blink, response, after, such, repeated, presentations, of, the, cs, and, us, the, cs, will, eventually, elicit, a, blink, before, the, us, a, conditioned, response, or, cr, experiments, showed, that, lesions, localized, either, to, a, specific, part, of, the, interposed, nucleus, one, of, the, deep, cerebellar, nuclei, or, to, a, few, specific, points, in, the, cerebellar, cortex, would, abolish, learning, of, a, conditionally, timed, blink, response, if, cerebellar, outputs, are, pharmacologically, inactivated, while, leaving, the, inputs, and, intracellular, circuits, intact, learning, takes, place, even, while, the, animal, fails, to, show, any, response, whereas, if, intracerebellar, circuits, are, disrupted, no, learning, takes, place, these, facts, taken, together, make, a, strong, case, that, the, learning, indeed, occurs, inside, the, cerebellum, the, large, base, of, knowledge, about, the, anatomical, structure, and, behavioral, functions, of, the, cerebellum, have, made, it, a, fertile, ground, for, theorizing, there, are, perhaps, more, theories, of, the, function, of, the, cerebellum, than, of, any, other, part, of, the, brain, the, most, basic, distinction, among, them, is, between, learning, theories, and, performance, theories, that, is, theories, that, make, use, of, synaptic, plasticity, within, the, cerebellum, to, account, for, its, role, in, learning, versus, theories, that, account, for, aspects, of, ongoing, behavior, on, the, basis, of, cerebellar, signal, processing, several, theories, of, both, types, have, been, formulated, as, mathematical, models, and, simulated, using, computers, perhaps, the, earliest, performance, theory, was, the, delay, line, hypothesis, of, valentino, braitenberg, the, original, theory, put, forth, by, braitenberg, and, roger, atwood, in, 1958, proposed, that, slow, propagation, of, signals, along, parallel, fibers, imposes, predictable, delays, that, allow, the, cerebellum, to, detect, time, relationships, within, a, certain, window, experimental, data, did, not, support, the, original, form, of, the, theory, but, braitenberg, continued, to, argue, for, modified, versions, the, hypothesis, that, the, cerebellum, functions, essentially, as, a, timing, system, has, also, been, advocated, by, richard, ivry, another, influential, performance, theory, is, the, tensor, network, theory, of, pellionisz, and, llin, s, which, provided, an, advanced, mathematical, formulation, of, the, idea, that, the, fundamental, computation, performed, by, the, cerebellum, is, to, transform, sensory, into, motor, coordinates, theories, in, the, learning, category, almost, all, derive, from, publications, by, marr, and, albus, marr, s, 1969, paper, proposed, that, the, cerebellum, is, a, device, for, learning, to, associate, elemental, movements, encoded, by, climbing, fibers, with, mossy, fiber, inputs, that, encode, the, sensory, context, albus, proposed, in, 1971, that, a, cerebellar, purkinje, cell, functions, as, a, perceptron, a, neurally, inspired, abstract, learning, device, the, most, basic, difference, between, the, marr, and, albus, theories, is, that, marr, assumed, that, climbing, fiber, activity, would, cause, parallel, fiber, synapses, to, be, strengthened, whereas, albus, proposed, that, they, would, be, weakened, albus, also, formulated, his, version, as, a, software, algorithm, he, called, a, cmac, cerebellar, model, articulation, controller, which, has, been, tested, in, a, number, of, applications, damage, to, the, cerebellum, often, causes, motor, related, symptoms, the, details, of, which, depend, on, the, part, of, the, cerebellum, involved, and, how, it, is, damaged, damage, to, the, flocculonodular, lobe, may, show, up, as, a, loss, of, equilibrium, and, in, particular, an, altered, irregular, walking, gait, with, a, wide, stance, caused, by, difficulty, in, balancing, damage, to, the, lateral, zone, typically, causes, problems, in, skilled, voluntary, and, planned, movements, which, can, cause, errors, in, the, force, direction, speed, and, amplitude, of, movements, other, manifestations, include, hypotonia, decreased, muscle, tone, dysarthria, problems, with, speech, articulation, dysmetria, problems, judging, distances, or, ranges, of, movement, dysdiadochokinesia, inability, to, perform, rapid, alternating, movements, such, as, walking, impaired, check, reflex, or, rebound, phenomenon, and, intention, tremor, involuntary, movement, caused, by, alternating, contractions, of, opposing, muscle, groups, damage, to, the, midline, portion, may, disrupt, whole, body, movements, whereas, damage, localized, more, laterally, is, more, likely, to, disrupt, fine, movements, of, the, hands, or, limbs, damage, to, the, upper, part, of, the, cerebellum, tends, to, cause, gait, impairments, and, other, problems, with, leg, coordination, damage, to, the, lower, part, is, more, likely, to, cause, uncoordinated, or, poorly, aimed, movements, of, the, arms, and, hands, as, well, as, difficulties, in, speed, this, complex, of, motor, symptoms, is, called, ataxia, to, identify, cerebellar, problems, neurological, examination, includes, assessment, of, gait, a, broad, based, gait, being, indicative, of, ataxia, finger, pointing, tests, and, assessment, of, posture, if, cerebellar, dysfunction, is, indicated, a, magnetic, resonance, imaging, scan, can, be, used, to, obtain, a, detailed, picture, of, any, structural, alterations, that, may, exist, the, list, of, medical, problems, that, can, produce, cerebellar, damage, is, long, including, stroke, hemorrhage, swelling, of, the, brain, cerebral, edema, tumors, alcoholism, physical, trauma, such, as, gunshot, wounds, or, explosives, and, chronic, degenerative, conditions, such, as, olivopontocerebellar, atrophy, some, forms, of, migraine, headache, may, also, produce, temporary, dysfunction, of, the, cerebellum, of, variable, severity, infection, can, result, in, cerebellar, damage, in, such, conditions, as, the, prion, diseases, and, miller, fisher, syndrome, a, variant, of, guillain, barr, syndrome, the, human, cerebellum, changes, with, age, these, changes, may, differ, from, those, of, other, parts, of, the, brain, the, cerebellum, is, the, youngest, brain, region, and, body, part, in, centenarians, according, to, an, epigenetic, biomarker, of, tissue, age, known, as, epigenetic, clock, it, is, about, 15, years, younger, than, expected, in, a, centenarian, further, gene, expression, patterns, in, the, human, cerebellum, show, less, age, related, alteration, than, that, in, the, cerebral, cortex, some, studies, have, reported, reductions, in, numbers, of, cells, or, volume, of, tissue, but, the, amount, of, data, relating, to, this, question, is, not, very, large, congenital, malformation, hereditary, disorders, and, acquired, conditions, can, affect, cerebellar, structure, and, consequently, cerebellar, function, unless, the, causative, condition, is, reversible, the, only, possible, treatment, is, to, help, people, live, with, their, problems, visualization, of, the, fetal, cerebellum, by, ultrasound, scan, at, 18, to, 20, weeks, of, pregnancy, can, be, used, to, screen, for, fetal, neural, tube,

the, cerebellum, can, in, turn, cause, herniation, of, cerebellar, tissue, as, seen, in, some, forms, of, arnold, chiari, malformation, other, conditions, that, are, closely, linked, to, cerebellar, degeneration, include, the, idiopathic, progressive, neurological, disorders, multiple, system, atrophy, and, ramsay, hunt, syndrome, type, i, and, the, autoimmune, disorder, paraneoplastic, cerebellar, degeneration, in, which, tumors, elsewhere, in, the, body, elicit, an, autoimmune, response, that, causes, neuronal, loss, in, the, cerebellum, cerebellar, atrophy, can, result, from, an, acute, deficiency, of, vitamin, b1, thiamine, as, seen, in, beriberi, and, in, wernicke, korsakoff, syndrome, or, vitamin, e, deficiency, cerebellar, atrophy, has, been, observed, in, many, other, neurological, disorders, including, huntington, s, disease, multiple, sclerosis, essential, tremor, progressive, myoclonus, epilepsy, and, niemann, pick, disease, cerebellar, atrophy, can, also, occur, as, a, result, of, exposure, to, toxins, including, heavy, metals, or, pharmaceutical, or, recreational, drugs, there, is, a, general, consensus, that, the, cerebellum, is, involved, in, pain, processing, the, cerebellum, receives, pain, input, from, both, descending, cortico, cerebellar, pathways, and, ascending, spino, cerebellar, pathways, through, the, pontine, nuclei, and, inferior, olives, some, of, this, information, is, transferred, to, the, motor, system, inducing, a, conscious, motor, avoidance, of, pain, graded, according, to, pain, intensity, these, direct, pain, inputs, as, well, as, indirect, inputs, are, thought, to, induce, long, term, pain, avoidance, behavior, that, results, in, chronic, posture, changes, and, consequently, in, functional, and, anatomical, remodeling, of, vestibular, and, proprioceptive, nuclei, as, a, result, chronic, neuropathic, pain, can, induce, macroscopic, anatomical, remodeling, of, the, hindbrain, including, the, cerebellum, the, magnitude, of, this, remodeling, and, the, induction, of, neuron, progenitor, markers, suggest, the, contribution, of, adult, neurogenesis, to, these, changes, the, circuits, in, the, cerebellum, are, similar, across, all, classes, of, vertebrates, including, fish, reptiles, birds, and, mammals, there, is, also, an, analogous, brain, structure, in, cephalopods, with, well, developed, brains, such, as, octopuses, this, has, been, taken, as, evidence, that, the, cerebellum, performs, functions, important, to, all, animal, species, with, a, brain, there, is, considerable, variation, in, the, size, and, shape, of, the, cerebellum, in, different, vertebrate, species, in, amphibians, it, is, little, developed, and, in, lampreys, and, hagfish, the, cerebellum, is, barely, distinguishable, from, the, brain, stem, although, the, spinocerebellum, is, present, in, these, groups, the, primary, structures, are, small, paired, nuclei, corresponding, to, the, vestibulocerebellum, the, cerebellum, is, a, bit, larger, in, reptiles, considerably, larger, in, birds, and, larger, still, in, mammals, the, large, paired, and, convoluted, lobes, found, in, humans, are, typical, of, mammals, but, the, cerebellum, is, in, general, a, single, median, lobe, in, other, groups, and, is, either, smooth, or, only, slightly, grooved, in, mammals, the, neocerebellum, is, the, major, part, of, the, cerebellum, by, mass, but, in, other, vertebrates, it, is, typically, the, spinocerebellum, the, cerebellum, of, cartilaginous, and, bony, fishes, is, extraordinarily, large, and, complex, in, at, least, one, important, respect, it, differs, in, internal, structure, from, the, mammalian, cerebellum, the, fish, cerebellum, does, not, contain, discrete, deep, cerebellar, nuclei, instead, the, primary, targets, of, purkinje, cells, are, a, distinct, type, of, cell, distributed, across, the, cerebellar, cortex, a, type, not, seen, in, mammals, in, mormyrid, fish, a, family, of, weakly, electrosensitive, freshwater, fish, the, cerebellum, is, considerably, larger, than, the, rest, of, the, brain, the, largest, part, of, it, is, a, special, structure, called, the, valvula, which, has, an, unusually, regular, architecture, and, receives, much, of, its, input, from, the, electrosensory, system, the, hallmark, of, the, mammalian, cerebellum, is, an, expansion, of, the, lateral, lobes, whose, main, interactions, are, with, the, neocortex, as, monkeys, evolved, into, great, apes, the, expansion, of, the, lateral, lobes, continued, in, tandem, with, the, expansion, of, the, frontal, lobes, of, the, neocortex, in, ancestral, hominids, and, in, homo, sapiens, until, the, middle, pleistocene, period, the, cerebellum, continued, to, expand, but, the, frontal, lobes, expanded, more, rapidly, the, most, recent, period, of, human, evolution, however, may, actually, have, been, associated, with, an, increase, in, the, relative, size, of, the, cerebellum, as, the, neocortex, reduced, its, size, somewhat, while, the, cerebellum, expanded, the, size, of, the, human, cerebellum, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, brain, has, been, increasing, in, size, while, the, cerebrum, decreased, in, size, with, both, the, development, and, implementation, of, motor, tasks, visual, spatial, skills, and, learning, taking, place, in, the, cerebellum, the, growth, of, the, cerebellum, is, thought, to, have, some, form, of, correlation, to, greater, human, cognitive, abilities, the, lateral, hemispheres, of, the, cerebellum, are, now, 2, 7, times, greater, in, both, humans, and, apes, than, they, are, in, monkeys, these, changes, in, the, cerebellum, size, cannot, be, explained, by, greater, muscle, mass, they, show, that, either, the, development, of, the, cerebellum, is, tightly, linked, to, that, of, the, rest, of, the, brain, or, that, neural, activities, taking, place, in, the, cerebellum, were, important, during, hominidae, evolution, due, to, the, cerebellum, s, role, in, cognitive, functions, the, increase, in, its, size, may, have, played, a, role, in, cognitive, expansion, most, vertebrate, species, have, a, cerebellum, and, one, or, more, cerebellum, like, structures, brain, areas, that, resemble, the, cerebellum, in, terms, of, cytoarchitecture, and, neurochemistry, the, only, cerebellum, like, structure, found, in, mammals, is, the, dorsal, cochlear, nucleus, dcn, one, of, the, two, primary, sensory, nuclei, that, receive, input, directly, from, the, auditory, nerve, the, dcn, is, a, layered, structure, with, the, bottom, layer, containing, granule, cells, similar, to, those, of, the, cerebellum, giving, rise, to, parallel, fibers, that, rise, to, the, superficial, layer, and, travel, across, it, horizontally, the, superficial, layer, contains, a, set, of, gabaergic, neurons, called, cartwheel, cells, that, resemble, purkinje, cells, anatomically, and, chemically, they, receive, parallel, fiber, input, but, do, not, have, any, inputs, that, resemble, climbing, fibers, the, output, neurons, of, the, dcn, are, pyramidal, cells, they, are, glutamatergic, but, also, resemble, purkinje, cells, in, some, respects, they, have, spiny, flattened, superficial, dendritic, trees, that, receive, parallel, fiber, input, but, they, also, have, basal, dendrites, that, receive, input, from, auditory, nerve, fibers, which, travel, across, the, dcn, in, a, direction, at, right, angles, to, the, parallel, fibers, the, dcn, is, most, highly, developed, in, rodents, and, other, small, animals, and, is, considerably, reduced, in, primates, its, function, is, not, well, understood, the, most, popular, speculations, relate, it, to, spatial, hearing, in, one, way, or, another, most, species, of, fish, and, amphibians, possess, a, lateral, line, system, that, senses, pressure, waves, in, water, one, of, the, brain, areas, that, receives, primary, input, from, the, lateral, line, organ, the, medial, octavolateral, nucleus, has, a, cerebellum, like, structure, with, granule, cells, and, parallel, fibers, in, electrosensitive, fish, the, input, from, the, electrosensory, system, goes, to, the, dorsal, octavolateral, nucleus, which, also, has, a, cerebellum, like, structure, in, ray, finned, fishes, by, far, the, largest, group, the, optic, tectum, has, a, layer, the, marginal, layer, that, is, cerebellum, like, all, of, these, cerebellum, like, structures, appear, to, be, primarily, sensory, related, rather, than, motor, related, all, of, them, have, granule, cells, that, give, rise, to, parallel, fibers, that, connect, to, purkinje, like, neurons, with, modifiable, synapses, but, none, have, climbing, fibers, comparable, to, those, of, the, cerebellum, instead, they, receive, direct, input, from, peripheral, sensory, organs, none, has, a, demonstrated, function, but, the, most, influential, speculation, is, that, they, serve, to, transform, sensory, inputs, in, some, sophisticated, way, perhaps, to, compensate, for, changes, in, body, posture, in, fact, james, m, bower, and, others, have, argued, partly, on, the, basis, of, these, structures, and, partly, on, the, basis, of, cerebellar, studies, that, the, cerebellum, itself, is, fundamentally, a, sensory, structure, and, that, it, contributes, to, motor, control, by, moving, the, body, in, a, way, that, controls, the, resulting, sensory, signals, despite, bower, s, viewpoint, there, is, also, strong, evidence, that, the, cerebellum, directly, influences, motor, output, in, mammals, even, the, earliest, anatomists, were, able, to, recognize, the, cerebellum, by, its, distinctive, appearance, aristotle, and, herophilus, quoted, in, galen, called, it, the, parenkephalis, as, opposed, to, the, enkephalos, or, brain, proper, galen, s, extensive, description, is, the, earliest, that, survives, he, speculated, that, the, cerebellum, was, the, source, of, motor, nerves, further, significant, developments, did, not, come, until, the, renaissance, vesalius, discussed, the, cerebellum, briefly, and, the, anatomy, was, described, more, thoroughly, by, thomas, willis, in, 1664, more, anatomical, work, was, done, during, the, 18th, century, but, it, was, not, until, early, in, the, 19th, century, that, the, first, insights, into, the, function, of, the, cerebellum, were, obtained, luigi, rolando, in, 1809, established, the, key, finding, that, damage, to, the, cerebellum, results, in, motor, disturbances, jean, pierre, flourens, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, carried, out, detailed, experimental, work, which, revealed, that, animals, with, cerebellar, damage, can, still, move, but, with, a, loss, of, coordination, strange, movements, awkward, gait, and, muscular, weakness, and, that, recovery, after, the, lesion, can, be, nearly, complete, unless, the, lesion, is, very, extensive, by, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, widely, accepted, that, the, primary, function, of, the, cerebellum, relates, to, motor, control, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, produced, several, detailed, descriptions, of, the, clinical, symptoms, associated, with, cerebellar, disease, in, humans, the, name, cerebellum, is, a, diminutive, of, cerebrum, brain, it, can, be, translated, literally, as, little, brain, the, latin, name, is, a, direct, translation, of, the, ancient, greek, parenkephalis, which, was, used, in, the, works, of, aristotle, the, first, known, writer, to, describe, the, structure, no, other, name, is, used, in, the, english, language, literature, but, historically, a, variety, of, greek, or, latin, derived, names, have, been, used, including, cerebrum, parvum, encephalion, encranion, cerebrum, posterius, and, parencephalis, this,
