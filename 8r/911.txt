cycads, s, a, k, d, z, are, seed, plants, that, typically, have, a, stout, and, woody, ligneous, trunk, with, a, crown, of, large, hard, stiff, evergreen, and, usually, pinnate, leaves, the, species, are, dioecious, that, is, individual, plants, of, a, species, are, either, male, or, female, cycads, vary, in, size, from, having, trunks, only, a, few, centimeters, to, several, meters, tall, they, typically, grow, very, slowly, and, live, very, long, because, of, their, superficial, resemblance, to, palms, or, ferns, they, are, sometimes, mistaken, for, them, but, they, are, not, closely, related, to, either, group, cycads, are, gymnosperms, naked, seeded, meaning, their, unfertilized, seeds, are, open, to, the, air, to, be, directly, fertilized, by, pollination, as, contrasted, with, angiosperms, which, have, enclosed, seeds, with, more, complex, fertilization, arrangements, cycads, have, very, specialized, pollinators, usually, a, specific, species, of, beetle, both, male, and, female, cycads, bear, cones, strobili, somewhat, similar, to, conifer, cones, cycads, have, been, reported, to, fix, nitrogen, in, association, with, various, cyanobacteria, living, in, the, roots, the, coralloid, roots, these, photosynthetic, bacteria, produce, a, neurotoxin, called, bmaa, that, is, found, in, the, seeds, of, cycads, this, neurotoxin, may, enter, a, human, food, chain, as, the, cycad, seeds, may, be, eaten, directly, as, a, source, of, flour, by, humans, or, by, wild, or, feral, animals, such, as, bats, and, humans, may, eat, these, animals, it, is, hypothesized, that, this, is, a, source, of, some, neurological, diseases, in, humans, another, defence, mechanism, against, herbivores, is, the, accumulation, of, toxins, in, seeds, and, vegetative, tissues, through, horizontal, gene, transfer, cycads, have, acquired, a, family, of, genes, fitd, from, a, microbial, organism, most, likely, a, fungus, which, gives, them, the, ability, to, produce, an, insecticidal, toxin, cycads, all, over, the, world, are, in, decline, with, four, species, on, the, brink, of, extinction, and, seven, species, having, fewer, than, 100, plants, left, in, the, wild, cycads, have, a, cylindrical, trunk, which, usually, does, not, branch, however, some, types, of, cycads, such, as, cycas, zeylanica, can, branch, their, trunks, the, apex, of, the, stem, is, protected, by, modified, leaves, called, cataphylls, leaves, grow, directly, from, the, trunk, and, typically, fall, when, older, leaving, a, crown, of, leaves, at, the, top, the, leaves, grow, in, a, rosette, form, with, new, foliage, emerging, from, the, top, and, center, of, the, crown, the, trunk, may, be, buried, so, the, leaves, appear, to, be, emerging, from, the, ground, so, the, plant, appears, to, be, a, basal, rosette, the, leaves, are, generally, large, in, proportion, to, the, trunk, size, and, sometimes, even, larger, than, the, trunk, the, leaves, are, pinnate, in, the, form, of, bird, feathers, pinnae, with, a, central, leaf, stalk, from, which, parallel, ribs, emerge, from, each, side, of, the, stalk, perpendicular, to, it, the, leaves, are, typically, either, compound, the, leaf, stalk, has, leaflets, emerging, from, it, as, ribs, or, have, edges, margins, so, deeply, cut, incised, so, as, to, appear, compound, the, australian, genus, bowenia, and, some, asian, species, of, cycas, like, cycas, multipinnata, cycas, micholitzii, and, cycas, debaoensis, have, leaves, that, are, bipinnate, which, means, the, leaflets, each, have, their, own, subleaflets, growing, in, the, same, form, on, the, leaflet, as, the, leaflets, grow, on, the, stalk, of, the, leaf, self, similar, geometry, due, to, superficial, similarities, in, foliage, and, plant, structure, cycads, and, palms, are, often, mistaken, for, each, other, they, also, can, occur, in, similar, climates, however, they, belong, to, different, phyla, and, as, such, are, not, closely, related, the, similar, structure, is, the, product, of, convergent, evolution, beyond, those, superficial, resemblances, there, are, a, number, of, differences, between, cycads, and, palms, for, one, both, male, and, female, cycads, are, gymnosperms, and, bear, cones, strobili, while, palms, are, angiosperms, and, so, flower, and, bear, fruit, the, mature, foliage, looks, very, similar, between, both, groups, but, the, young, emerging, leaves, of, a, cycad, resemble, a, fiddlehead, fern, before, they, unfold, and, take, their, place, in, the, rosette, while, the, leaves, of, palms, are, just, small, versions, of, the, mature, frond, another, difference, is, in, the, stem, both, plants, leave, some, scars, on, the, stem, below, the, rosette, where, there, used, to, be, leaves, but, the, scars, of, a, cycad, are, helically, arranged, and, small, while, the, scars, of, palms, are, a, circle, that, wraps, around, the, whole, stem, the, stems, of, cycads, are, also, in, general, rougher, and, shorter, than, those, of, palms, the, two, extant, families, of, cycads, all, belong, to, the, order, cycadales, and, are, the, cycadaceae, and, zamiaceae, including, stangeriaceae, these, cycads, have, changed, little, since, the, jurassic, in, comparison, to, some, other, plant, divisions, five, additional, families, belonging, to, the, medullosales, became, extinct, by, the, end, of, the, paleozoic, era, based, on, genetic, studies, cycads, are, thought, to, be, more, closely, related, to, ginkgo, than, to, other, living, gymnosperms, both, are, thought, to, have, diverged, from, each, other, during, the, early, carboniferous, cycads, ginkgo, conifers, bennettitales, gnetales, angiosperms, cycads, ginkgo, conifers, gnetophytes, flowering, plants, cycas, dioon, macrozamia, lepidozamia, encephalartos, bowenia, ceratozamia, stangeria, zamia, microcycas, classification, of, the, cycadophyta, to, the, rank, of, family, the, following, extinct, cycad, genera, are, known, the, oldest, probable, cycad, foliage, is, known, from, the, latest, carboniferous, early, permian, of, south, korea, and, china, such, as, crossozamia, unambiguous, fossils, of, cycads, are, known, from, the, early, middle, permian, onwards, cycads, were, generally, uncommon, during, the, permian, the, two, living, cycad, families, are, thought, to, have, split, from, each, other, sometime, between, the, jurassic, and, carboniferous, cycads, are, thought, to, have, reached, their, apex, of, diversity, during, the, mesozoic, although, the, mesozoic, is, sometimes, called, the, age, of, cycads, some, other, groups, of, extinct, seed, plants, with, similar, foliage, such, as, bennettitales, and, nilssoniales, that, are, not, closely, related, may, have, been, more, abundant, the, oldest, records, of, the, modern, genus, cycas, are, from, the, paleogene, of, east, asia, fossils, assignable, to, zamiaceae, are, known, from, the, cretaceous, with, fossils, assignable, to, living, genera, of, the, family, known, from, the, cenozoic, the, living, cycads, are, found, across, much, of, the, subtropical, and, tropical, parts, of, the, world, with, a, few, in, temperate, regions, such, as, in, australia, the, greatest, diversity, occurs, in, south, and, central, america, they, are, also, found, in, mexico, the, antilles, southeastern, united, states, australia, melanesia, micronesia, japan, china, southeast, asia, bangladesh, india, sri, lanka, madagascar, and, southern, and, tropical, africa, where, at, least, 65, species, occur, some, can, survive, in, harsh, desert, or, semi, desert, climates, xerophytic, others, in, wet, rain, forest, conditions, and, some, in, both, some, can, grow, in, sand, or, even, on, rock, some, in, oxygen, poor, swampy, bog, like, soils, rich, in, organic, material, some, are, able, to, grow, in, full, sun, some, in, full, shade, and, some, in, both, some, are, salt, tolerant, halophytes, species, diversity, of, the, extant, cycads, peaks, at, 17, 15, n, and, 28, 12, s, with, a, minor, peak, at, the, equator, there, is, therefore, not, a, latitudinal, diversity, gradient, towards, the, equator, but, towards, the, tropic, of, cancer, and, the, tropic, of, capricorn, however, the, peak, near, the, northern, tropic, is, largely, due, to, cycas, in, asia, and, zamia, in, the, new, world, whereas, the, peak, near, the, southern, tropic, is, due, to, cycas, again, and, also, to, the, diverse, genus, encephalartos, in, southern, and, central, africa, and, macrozamia, in, australia, thus, the, distribution, pattern, of, cycad, species, with, latitude, appears, to, be, an, artifact, of, the, geographical, isolation, of, the, remaining, cycad, genera, and, their, species, and, perhaps, because, they, are, partly, xerophytic, rather, than, simply, tropical, nuts, of, the, cycas, orientis, nyathu, are, coveted, by, the, yolngu, in, australia, s, arnhem, land, as, a, source, of, food, they, are, harvested, on, their, dry, season, to, leach, its, poison, under, water, overnight, before, ground, into, a, paste, wrapped, under, bark, and, cooked, on, open, fire, until, done, in, vanuatu, the, cycad, is, known, as, namele, and, is, an, important, symbol, of, traditional, culture, it, serves, as, a, powerful, taboo, sign, and, a, pair, of, namele, leaves, appears, on, the, national, flag, and, coat, of, arms, together, with, the, nanggaria, plant, another, symbol, of, vanuatu, culture, the, namele, also, gives, its, name, to, nagriamel, an, indigenous, political, movement
