apocynaceae, p, s, n, e, s, i, a, s, i, i, from, apocynum, greek, for, dog, away, is, a, family, of, flowering, plants, that, includes, trees, shrubs, herbs, stem, succulents, and, vines, commonly, known, as, the, dogbane, family, because, some, taxa, were, used, as, dog, poison, members, of, the, family, are, native, to, the, european, asian, african, australian, and, american, tropics, or, subtropics, with, some, temperate, members, the, former, family, asclepiadaceae, now, known, as, asclepiadoideae, is, considered, a, subfamily, of, apocynaceae, and, contains, 348, genera, a, list, of, apocynaceae, genera, may, be, found, here, many, species, are, tall, trees, found, in, tropical, forests, but, some, grow, in, tropical, dry, xeric, environments, also, perennial, herbs, from, temperate, zones, occur, many, of, these, plants, have, milky, latex, and, many, species, are, poisonous, if, ingested, the, family, being, rich, in, genera, containing, alkaloids, and, cardiac, glycosides, those, containing, the, latter, often, finding, use, as, arrow, poisons, some, genera, of, apocynaceae, such, as, adenium, bleed, clear, sap, without, latex, when, damaged, and, others, such, as, pachypodium, have, milky, latex, apart, from, their, sap, the, dogbane, milkweed, family, includes, annual, plants, perennial, herbs, stem, succulents, woody, shrubs, trees, or, vines, most, exude, a, milky, latex, when, cut, leaves, are, simple, they, may, appear, one, at, a, time, singly, with, each, occurrence, on, alternating, sides, of, the, stem, but, usually, occur, in, pairs, and, rarely, in, whorls, when, paired, they, occur, on, opposite, sides, of, the, stem, opposite, with, each, pair, occurring, at, an, angle, rotated, 90, to, the, pair, below, it, decussate, there, is, no, stipule, a, small, leaf, like, structure, at, the, base, of, the, leaf, stem, or, stipules, are, small, and, sometimes, finger, like, flowers, have, radial, symmetry, actinomorphic, and, are, borne, in, heads, that, are, cymes, or, racemes, or, are, solitary, in, axils, they, are, perfect, bisexual, with, a, synsepalous, five, lobed, calyx, united, into, a, tube, at, the, base, inflorescences, are, terminal, or, axillary, five, petals, are, united, into, a, tube, with, four, or, five, epipetalous, stamens, the, style, head, is, swollen, the, pollen, is, transported, in, foam, the, ovary, is, usually, superior, bicarpellary, and, apocarpous, with, a, common, fused, style, and, stigma, fig, 5, and, fig, 6, in, the, illustration, of, rhigospira, quadrangularis, show, a, typical, tripartite, style, which, divides, into, three, zones, specialised, for, pollen, deposition, viscin, secretion, and, the, reception, of, pollen, the, fruit, is, a, drupe, a, berry, a, capsule, or, a, frequently, paired, follicle, the, seeds, are, often, winged, or, have, appendages, of, long, silky, hairs, as, of, 2012, the, family, was, described, as, comprising, some, 5, 100, species, in, five, subfamilies, the, former, family, asclepiadaceae, is, included, in, apocynaceae, according, to, the, angiosperm, phylogeny, group, iii, apg, iii, modern, largely, molecular, based, system, of, flowering, plant, taxonomy, an, updated, classification, including, 366, genera, 25, tribes, and, 49, subtribes, was, published, in, 2014, 376, genera, are, currently, accepted, species, in, this, family, are, distributed, mainly, in, tropical, regions, several, genera, are, preferred, larval, host, plants, for, the, queen, butterfly, danaus, gilippus, many, species, of, plants, from, the, family, apocynaceae, have, some, toxicity, with, some, being, extremely, poisonous, if, parts, are, ingested, or, if, they, are, not, handled, properly, genera, containing, cardiac, glycosides, cerbera, nerium, asclepias, cascabela, strophanthus, acokanthera, apocynum, thevetia, etc, have, therapeutic, ranges, but, are, often, associated, with, accidental, poisonings, in, many, cases, lethal, see, below, alkaloid, producing, species, like, rauvolfia, serpentina, catharanthus, roseus, and, tabernanthe, iboga, are, likewise, the, source, of, compounds, with, therapeutic, ranges, but, which, have, significant, associated, toxicities, if, not, taken, in, appropriate, doses, and, in, controlled, fashion, see, below, several, members, of, the, family, apocynaceae, have, had, economic, uses, in, the, past, several, are, sources, of, important, natural, products, pharmacologic, tool, compounds, and, drug, research, candidates, and, in, some, cases, actual, prescription, drugs, cardiac, glycosides, which, affect, heart, function, are, a, ready, example, genera, studied, and, known, to, contain, such, glycosides, include, acokanthera, apocynum, cerbera, nerium, thevetia, and, strophanthus, rauvolfia, serpentina, indian, snakeroot, contains, the, alkaloid, reserpine, which, has, been, used, as, an, antihypertensive, and, an, antipsychotic, drug, but, its, adverse, effects, limit, its, clinical, use, catharanthus, roseus, yields, alkaloids, used, in, the, treatment, of, cancer, tabernanthe, iboga, voacanga, africana, and, tabernaemontana, undulata, contain, the, alkaloid, ibogaine, which, is, a, psychedelic, drug, which, may, help, with, drug, addiction, but, which, has, significant, adverse, effects, with, ibogaine, being, both, cardiotoxic, and, neurotoxic, ajmalicine, an, alkaloid, found, in, rauvolfia, spp, catharanthus, roseus, and, mitragyna, speciosa, is, an, antihypertensive, drug, used, in, the, treatment, of, high, blood, pressure, many, genera, are, grown, as, ornamental, plants, including, amsonia, bluestar, nerium, oleander, vinca, periwinkle, carissa, natal, plum, allamanda, golden, trumpet, plumeria, frangipani, thevetia, mandevilla, savannah, flower, and, adenium, desert, rose, in, addition, the, genera, landolphia, carpodinus, and, mascarenhasia, have, been, used, as, commercial, sources, of, inferior, rubber, see, congo, rubber, there, are, limited, dietary, uses, of, plants, from, this, family, the, flower, of, echites, panduratus, common, name, loroco, is, edible, carissa, natal, plum, produces, an, edible, fruit, but, all, other, parts, of, the, plant, are, poisonous, the, genus, apocynum, was, reportedly, used, as, a, source, of, fiber, by, native, americans, the, aromatic, fruit, juice, from, saba, comorensis, syn, landolphia, comorensis, the, bungo, or, mbungo, fruit, is, used, as, a, drink, finally, ethnopharmacologic, and, ethnotoxicologic, uses, are, also, known, the, roots, of, tabernanthe, iboga, and, certain, voacanga, species, have, traditionally, been, used, ceremonially, as, hallucinogens, in, africa, the, ibogaine, type, alkaloids, responsible, for, the, psychoactivity, of, these, plants, have, been, studied, with, regard, to, the, treatment, of, drug, addiction, the, juice, of, acokanthera, species, such, as, a, venenata, and, the, milky, juice, of, the, namibian, pachypodium, have, been, used, as, poison, for, arrow, tips, many, species, are, ornamental, in, gardens, or, as, houseplants
