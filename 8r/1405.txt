dengue, fever, is, a, mosquito, borne, disease, caused, by, dengue, virus, prevalent, in, tropical, and, subtropical, areas, it, is, frequently, asymptomatic, if, symptoms, appear, they, typically, begin, 3, to, 14, days, after, infection, these, may, include, a, high, fever, headache, vomiting, muscle, and, joint, pains, and, a, characteristic, skin, itching, and, skin, rash, recovery, generally, takes, two, to, seven, days, in, a, small, proportion, of, cases, the, disease, develops, into, severe, dengue, previously, known, as, dengue, hemorrhagic, fever, or, dengue, shock, syndrome, with, bleeding, low, levels, of, blood, platelets, blood, plasma, leakage, and, dangerously, low, blood, pressure, dengue, virus, has, four, confirmed, serotypes, infection, with, one, type, usually, gives, lifelong, immunity, to, that, type, but, only, short, term, immunity, to, the, others, subsequent, infection, with, a, different, type, increases, the, risk, of, severe, complications, the, symptoms, of, dengue, resemble, many, other, diseases, including, malaria, influenza, and, zika, blood, tests, are, available, to, confirm, the, diagnosis, including, detecting, viral, rna, or, antibodies, to, the, virus, there, is, no, specific, treatment, for, dengue, fever, in, mild, cases, treatment, is, focused, on, treating, pain, symptoms, severe, cases, of, dengue, require, hospitalisation, treatment, of, acute, dengue, is, supportive, and, includes, giving, fluid, either, by, mouth, or, intravenously, dengue, is, spread, by, several, species, of, female, mosquitoes, of, the, aedes, genus, principally, aedes, aegypti, infection, can, be, prevented, by, mosquito, elimination, and, the, prevention, of, bites, two, types, of, dengue, vaccine, have, been, approved, and, are, commercially, available, dengvaxia, became, available, in, 2016, but, it, is, only, recommended, to, prevent, re, infection, in, individuals, who, have, been, previously, infected, the, second, vaccine, qdenga, became, available, in, 2022, and, is, suitable, for, adults, adolescents, and, children, from, four, years, of, age, the, earliest, descriptions, of, a, dengue, outbreak, date, from, 1779, its, viral, cause, and, spread, were, understood, by, the, early, 20th, century, already, endemic, in, more, than, one, hundred, countries, dengue, is, spreading, from, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, to, the, iberian, peninsula, and, the, southern, states, of, the, us, partly, attributed, to, climate, change, it, is, classified, as, a, neglected, tropical, disease, during, 2023, more, than, 5, million, infections, were, reported, with, more, than, 5, 000, dengue, related, deaths, as, most, cases, are, asymptomatic, or, mild, the, actual, numbers, of, dengue, cases, and, deaths, are, under, reported, typically, people, infected, with, dengue, virus, are, asymptomatic, 80, or, have, only, mild, symptoms, such, as, an, uncomplicated, fever, others, have, more, severe, illness, 5, and, in, a, small, proportion, it, is, life, threatening, the, incubation, period, time, between, exposure, and, onset, of, symptoms, ranges, from, 3, to, 14, days, but, most, often, it, is, 4, to, 7, days, the, characteristic, symptoms, of, mild, dengue, are, sudden, onset, fever, headache, typically, located, behind, the, eyes, muscle, and, joint, pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen, glands, and, a, rash, if, this, progresses, to, severe, dengue, the, symptoms, are, severe, abdominal, pain, persistent, vomiting, rapid, breathing, bleeding, gums, or, nose, fatigue, restlessness, blood, in, vomit, or, stool, extreme, thirst, pale, and, cold, skin, and, feelings, of, weakness, the, course, of, infection, is, divided, into, three, phases, febrile, critical, and, recovery, the, febrile, phase, involves, high, fever, 40, c, 104, f, and, is, associated, with, generalized, pain, and, a, headache, this, usually, lasts, two, to, seven, days, there, may, also, be, nausea, vomiting, a, rash, and, pains, in, the, muscle, and, joints, most, people, recover, within, a, week, or, so, in, about, 5, of, cases, symptoms, worsen, and, can, become, life, threatening, this, is, called, severe, dengue, formerly, called, dengue, hemorrhagic, fever, or, dengue, shock, syndrome, severe, dengue, can, lead, to, shock, internal, bleeding, organ, failure, and, even, death, warning, signs, include, severe, stomach, pain, vomiting, difficulty, breathing, and, blood, in, the, nose, gums, vomit, or, stools, during, this, period, there, is, leakage, of, plasma, from, the, blood, vessels, together, with, a, reduction, in, platelets, this, may, result, in, fluid, accumulation, in, the, chest, and, abdominal, cavity, as, well, as, depletion, of, fluid, from, the, circulation, and, decreased, blood, supply, to, vital, organs, the, recovery, phase, usually, lasts, two, to, three, days, the, improvement, is, often, striking, and, can, be, accompanied, with, severe, itching, and, a, slow, heart, rate, complications, following, severe, dengue, include, fatigue, somnolence, headache, concentration, impairment, and, memory, impairment, a, pregnant, woman, who, develops, dengue, is, at, higher, risk, of, miscarriage, low, birth, weight, birth, and, premature, birth, dengue, virus, denv, is, an, rna, virus, of, the, family, flaviviridae, genus, flavivirus, other, members, of, the, same, genus, include, yellow, fever, virus, west, nile, virus, and, zika, virus, dengue, virus, genome, genetic, material, contains, about, 11, 000, nucleotide, bases, which, code, for, the, three, structural, protein, molecules, c, prm, and, e, that, form, the, virus, particle, and, seven, other, protein, molecules, that, are, required, for, replication, of, the, virus, there, are, four, confirmed, strains, of, the, virus, called, serotypes, referred, to, as, denv, 1, denv, 2, denv, 3, and, denv, 4, the, distinctions, between, the, serotypes, are, based, on, their, antigenicity, dengue, virus, is, most, frequently, transmitted, by, the, bite, of, mosquitos, in, the, aedes, genus, particularly, a, aegypti, they, prefer, to, feed, at, dusk, and, dawn, but, they, may, bite, and, thus, spread, infection, at, any, time, of, day, other, aedes, species, that, may, transmit, the, disease, include, a, albopictus, a, polynesiensis, and, a, scutellaris, humans, are, the, primary, host, of, the, virus, but, it, also, circulates, in, nonhuman, primates, and, can, infect, other, mammals, an, infection, can, be, acquired, via, a, single, bite, for, 2, to, 10, days, after, becoming, newly, infected, a, person, s, bloodstream, will, contain, a, high, level, of, virus, particles, the, viremic, period, a, female, mosquito, that, takes, a, blood, meal, from, the, infected, host, then, propagates, the, virus, in, the, cells, lining, its, gut, over, the, next, few, days, the, virus, spreads, to, other, tissues, including, the, mosquito, s, salivary, glands, and, is, released, into, its, saliva, next, time, the, mosquito, feeds, the, infectious, saliva, will, be, injected, into, the, bloodstream, of, its, victim, thus, spreading, the, disease, the, virus, seems, to, have, no, detrimental, effect, on, the, mosquito, which, remains, infected, for, life, dengue, can, also, be, transmitted, via, infected, blood, products, and, through, organ, donation, vertical, transmission, from, mother, to, child, during, pregnancy, or, at, birth, has, been, reported, the, principal, risk, for, infection, with, dengue, is, the, bite, of, an, infected, mosquito, this, is, more, probable, in, areas, where, the, disease, is, endemic, especially, where, there, is, high, population, density, poor, sanitation, and, standing, water, where, mosquitoes, can, breed, it, can, be, mitigated, by, taking, steps, to, avoid, bites, such, as, by, wearing, clothing, that, fully, covers, the, skin, using, mosquito, netting, while, resting, and, or, the, application, of, insect, repellent, deet, being, the, most, effective, chronic, diseases, such, as, asthma, sickle, cell, anemia, and, diabetes, mellitus, increase, the, risk, of, developing, a, severe, form, of, the, disease, other, risk, factors, for, severe, disease, include, female, sex, and, high, body, mass, index, infection, with, one, serotype, is, thought, to, produce, lifelong, immunity, to, that, type, but, only, short, term, protection, against, the, other, three, subsequent, re, infection, with, a, different, serotype, increases, the, risk, of, severe, complications, due, to, phenomenon, known, as, antibody, dependent, enhancement, ade, the, exact, mechanism, of, ade, is, not, fully, understood, it, appears, that, ade, occurs, when, the, antibodies, generated, during, an, immune, response, recognize, and, bind, to, a, pathogen, but, they, fail, to, neutralize, it, instead, the, antibody, virus, complex, has, an, enhanced, ability, to, bind, to, the, fc, receptors, of, the, target, immune, cells, enabling, the, virus, to, infect, the, cell, and, reproduce, itself, when, a, mosquito, carrying, dengue, virus, bites, a, person, the, virus, enters, the, skin, together, with, the, mosquito, s, saliva, the, virus, infects, nearby, skin, cells, called, keratinocytes, as, well, as, specialized, immune, cell, located, in, the, skin, called, a, langerhans, cells, the, langerhans, cells, migrate, to, the, lymph, nodes, where, the, infection, spreads, to, white, blood, cells, and, reproduces, inside, the, cells, while, they, move, throughout, the, body, the, white, blood, cells, respond, by, producing, several, signaling, proteins, such, as, cytokines, and, interferons, which, are, responsible, for, many, of, the, symptoms, such, as, the, fever, the, flu, like, symptoms, and, the, severe, pains, in, severe, infection, the, virus, production, inside, the, body, is, greatly, increased, and, many, more, organs, such, as, the, liver, and, the, bone, marrow, can, be, affected, fluid, from, the, bloodstream, leaks, through, the, wall, of, small, blood, vessels, into, body, cavities, due, to, increased, capillary, permeability, as, a, result, blood, volume, decreases, and, the, blood, pressure, becomes, so, low, that, it, cannot, supply, sufficient, blood, to, vital, organs, the, spread, of, the, virus, to, the, bone, marrow, leads, to, reduced, numbers, of, platelets, which, are, necessary, for, effective, blood, clotting, this, increases, the, risk, of, bleeding, the, other, major, complication, of, dengue, fever, the, principal, risk, for, infection, with, dengue, is, the, bite, of, an, infected, mosquito, this, is, more, probable, in, areas, where, the, disease, is, endemic, especially, where, there, is, high, population, density, poor, sanitation, and, standing, water, where, mosquitoes, can, breed, it, can, be, mitigated, by, taking, steps, to, avoid, bites, such, as, by, wearing, clothing, that, fully, covers, the, skin, using, mosquito, netting, while, resting, and, or, the, application, of, insect, repellent, deet, being, the, most, effective, it, is, also, advisable, to, treat, clothing, nets, and, tents, with, 0, 5, permethrin, protection, of, the, home, can, be, achieved, with, door, and, window, screens, by, using, air, conditioning, and, by, regularly, emptying, and, cleaning, all, receptacles, both, indoors, and, outdoors, which, may, accumulate, water, such, as, buckets, planters, pools, or, trashcans, the, primary, method, of, controlling, a, aegypti, is, by, eliminating, its, habitats, this, is, done, by, eliminating, open, sources, of, water, or, if, this, is, not, possible, by, adding, insecticides, or, biological, control, agents, to, these, areas, generalized, spraying, with, organophosphate, or, pyrethroid, insecticides, while, sometimes, done, is, not, thought, to, be, effective, reducing, open, collections, of, water, through, environmental, modification, is, the, preferred, method, of, control, given, the, concerns, of, negative, health, effects, from, insecticides, and, greater, logistical, difficulties, with, control, agents, ideally, mosquito, control, would, be, a, community, activity, e, g, when, all, members, of, a, community, clear, blocked, gutters, and, street, drains, and, keep, their, yards, free, of, containers, with, standing, water, if, residences, have, direct, water, connections, this, eliminates, the, need, for, wells, or, street, pumps, and, water, carrying, containers, as, of, march, 2024, there, are, two, vaccines, to, protect, against, dengue, infection, dengvaxia, and, qdenga, dengvaxia, formerly, cyd, tdv, became, available, in, 2015, and, is, approved, for, use, in, the, us, eu, and, in, some, asian, and, latin, american, countries, it, is, an, attenuated, virus, is, suitable, for, individuals, aged, 6, 45, years, and, protects, against, all, four, serotypes, of, dengue, due, to, safety, concerns, about, antibody, dependent, enhancement, ade, it, should, only, be, given, to, individuals, who, have, previously, been, infected, with, dengue, in, order, to, protect, them, from, reinfection, it, is, given, subcutaneously, as, three, doses, at, six, month, intervals, qdenga, formerly, tak, 003, completed, clinical, trials, in, 2022, and, was, approved, for, use, in, the, european, union, in, december, 2022, it, has, been, approved, by, a, number, of, other, countries, including, indonesia, and, brazil, and, has, been, recommended, by, the, sage, committee, of, the, world, health, organization, it, is, indicated, for, the, prevention, of, dengue, disease, in, individuals, four, years, of, age, and, older, and, can, be, administered, to, people, who, have, not, been, previously, infected, with, dengue, it, is, a, live, attenuated, vaccine, containing, the, four, serotypes, of, dengue, virus, administered, subcutaneously, as, two, doses, three, months, apart, the, world, health, organization, s, international, classification, of, diseases, divides, dengue, fever, into, two, classes, uncomplicated, and, severe, severe, dengue, is, defined, as, that, associated, with, severe, bleeding, severe, organ, dysfunction, or, severe, plasma, leakage, severe, dengue, can, develop, suddenly, sometimes, after, a, few, days, as, the, fever, subsides, leakage, of, plasma, from, the, capillaries, results, in, extreme, low, blood, pressure, and, hypovolemic, shock, patients, with, severe, plasma, leakage, may, have, fluid, accumulation, in, the, lungs, or, abdomen, insufficient, protein, in, the, blood, or, thickening, of, the, blood, severe, dengue, is, a, medical, emergency, which, can, cause, damage, to, organs, leading, to, multiple, organ, failure, and, death, mild, cases, of, dengue, fever, can, easily, be, confused, with, several, common, diseases, including, influenza, measles, chikungunya, and, zika, dengue, chikungunya, and, zika, share, the, same, mode, of, transmission, aedes, mosquitoes, and, are, often, endemic, in, the, same, regions, so, that, it, is, possible, to, be, infected, simultaneously, by, more, than, one, disease, for, travellers, dengue, fever, diagnosis, should, be, considered, in, anyone, who, develops, a, fever, within, two, weeks, of, being, in, the, tropics, or, subtropics, warning, symptoms, of, severe, dengue, include, abdominal, pain, persistent, vomiting, odema, bleeding, lethargy, and, liver, enlargement, once, again, these, symptoms, can, be, confused, with, other, diseases, such, as, malaria, gastroenteritis, leptospirosis, and, typhus, blood, tests, can, be, used, to, confirm, a, diagnosis, of, dengue, during, the, first, few, days, of, infection, enzyme, linked, immunosorbent, assay, elisa, can, be, used, to, detect, the, ns1, antigen, however, this, antigen, is, produced, by, all, flaviviruses, four, or, five, days, into, the, infection, it, is, possible, to, reliably, detect, anti, dengue, igm, antibodies, but, this, does, not, determine, the, serotype, nucleic, acid, amplification, tests, provide, the, most, reliable, method, of, diagnosis, as, of, july, 2024, there, is, no, specific, antiviral, treatment, available, for, dengue, fever, most, cases, of, dengue, fever, have, mild, symptoms, and, recovery, takes, place, in, a, few, days, no, treatment, is, required, for, these, cases, acetaminophen, paracetamol, tylenol, may, be, used, to, relieve, mild, fever, or, pain, other, common, pain, relievers, including, aspirin, ibuprofen, advil, motrin, ib, others, and, naproxen, sodium, aleve, should, be, avoided, as, they, can, increase, the, risk, of, bleeding, complications, for, moderate, illness, those, who, can, drink, are, passing, urine, have, no, warning, signs, and, are, otherwise, reasonably, healthy, can, be, monitored, carefully, at, home, supportive, care, with, analgesics, fluid, replacement, and, bed, rest, are, recommended, severe, dengue, is, a, life, threatening, emergency, requiring, hospitalization, and, potentially, intensive, care, warning, signs, include, dehydration, decreasing, platelets, and, increasing, hematocrit, treatment, modes, include, intravenous, fluids, and, transfusion, with, platelets, or, plasma, most, people, with, dengue, recover, without, any, ongoing, problems, the, risk, of, death, among, those, with, severe, dengue, is, 0, 8, 2, 5, and, with, adequate, treatment, this, is, less, than, 1, however, those, who, develop, significantly, low, blood, pressure, may, have, a, fatality, rate, of, up, to, 26, the, risk, of, death, among, children, less, than, five, years, old, is, four, times, greater, than, among, those, over, the, age, of, 10, elderly, people, are, also, at, higher, risk, of, a, poor, outcome, as, of, march, 2023, dengue, is, endemic, in, more, than, 100, countries, with, cases, reported, in, every, continent, with, the, exception, of, antarctica, the, americas, southeast, asia, and, the, western, pacific, regions, are, the, most, seriously, affected, it, is, difficult, to, estimate, the, full, extent, of, the, disease, as, many, cases, are, mild, and, not, correctly, diagnosed, who, currently, estimates, that, 3, 9, billion, people, are, at, risk, of, dengue, infection, in, 2013, it, was, estimated, that, 390, million, dengue, infections, occur, every, year, with, 500, 000, of, these, developing, severe, symptoms, and, 25, 000, deaths, generally, areas, where, dengue, is, endemic, have, only, one, serotype, of, the, virus, in, circulation, the, disease, is, said, to, be, hyperendemic, in, areas, where, more, than, one, serotype, is, circulating, this, increases, the, risk, of, severe, disease, on, a, second, or, subsequent, infection, infections, are, most, commonly, acquired, in, urban, environments, where, the, virus, is, primarily, transmitted, by, the, mosquito, species, aedes, aegypti, this, species, has, adapted, to, the, urban, environment, is, generally, found, close, to, human, habitation, prefers, humans, as, its, host, and, takes, advantage, of, small, bodies, of, standing, water, such, as, tanks, and, buckets, in, which, to, breed, in, rural, settings, the, virus, is, transmitted, to, humans, by, a, aegypti, and, other, related, mosquitoes, such, as, aedes, albopictus, both, these, species, have, expanding, ranges, dengue, has, increased, in, incidence, in, recent, decades, with, who, recording, a, ten, fold, increase, between, 2010, and, 2019, from, 500, 000, to, 5, million, recorded, cases, this, increase, is, tied, closely, to, the, increasing, range, of, aedes, mosquitoes, which, is, attributed, to, a, combination, of, urbanization, population, growth, and, an, increasingly, warm, climate, in, endemic, areas, dengue, infections, peak, when, rainfall, is, optimal, for, mosquito, breeding, the, disease, infects, all, races, sexes, and, ages, equally, in, endemic, areas, the, infection, is, most, commonly, seen, in, children, who, then, acquire, a, lifelong, partial, immunity, the, first, historical, record, of, a, case, of, probable, dengue, fever, is, in, a, chinese, medical, encyclopedia, from, the, jin, dynasty, 266, 420, which, referred, to, a, water, poison, associated, with, flying, insects, the, principal, mosquito, vector, of, dengue, aedes, aegypti, spread, out, of, africa, in, the, 15th, to, 19th, centuries, due, to, the, slave, trade, and, consequent, expansion, of, international, trading, there, have, been, descriptions, of, epidemics, of, dengue, like, illness, in, the, 17th, century, and, it, is, likely, that, epidemics, in, jakarta, cairo, and, philadelphia, during, the, 18th, century, were, caused, by, dengue, it, is, assumed, that, dengue, was, constantly, present, in, many, tropical, urban, centres, throughout, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, even, though, significant, outbreaks, were, infrequent, the, marked, spread, of, dengue, during, and, after, the, second, world, war, has, been, attributed, partly, to, disruption, caused, by, the, war, and, partly, to, subsequent, urbanisation, in, south, east, asia, as, novel, serotypes, were, introduced, to, regions, already, endemic, with, dengue, outbreaks, of, severe, disease, followed, the, severe, hemorrhagic, form, of, the, disease, was, first, reported, in, the, philippines, in, 1953, by, the, 1970s, it, had, become, recognised, as, a, major, cause, of, child, mortality, in, southeast, asia, in, central, and, south, america, the, aedes, mosquito, had, been, eradicated, in, the, 1950s, however, the, eradication, program, was, discontinued, in, the, 1970s, and, the, disease, re, established, itself, in, the, region, during, the, 1980s, becoming, hyperendemic, and, causing, significant, epidemics, dengue, has, continued, to, increase, in, prevalence, during, the, 21st, century, as, the, mosquito, vector, continues, to, expand, its, range, this, is, attributed, partly, to, continuing, urbanisation, and, partly, to, the, impact, of, a, warmer, climate, the, name, came, into, english, in, the, early, 19th, century, from, west, indian, spanish, which, borrowed, it, from, the, kiswahili, term, dinga, denga, meaning, cramp, like, seizure, the, full, term, of, the, condition, being, ki, dinga, pepo, a, sort, of, cramp, like, seizure, caused, by, an, evil, spirit, the, borrowed, term, changed, to, dengue, in, spanish, due, to, this, word, existing, in, spanish, with, the, meaning, fastidiousness, and, this, folk, etymology, referring, to, the, dislike, of, movement, by, affected, patients, slaves, in, the, west, indies, having, contracted, dengue, were, said, to, have, the, posture, and, gait, of, a, dandy, and, the, disease, was, known, as, dandy, fever, the, term, break, bone, fever, was, applied, by, physician, and, united, states, founding, father, benjamin, rush, in, a, 1789, report, of, the, 1780, epidemic, in, philadelphia, due, to, the, associated, muscle, and, joint, pains, in, the, report, title, he, uses, the, more, formal, term, bilious, remitting, fever, the, term, dengue, fever, came, into, general, use, only, after, 1828, other, historical, terms, include, breakheart, fever, and, la, dengue, terms, for, severe, disease, include, infectious, thrombocytopenic, purpura, and, philippine, thai, or, singapore, hemorrhagic, fever, research, directions, include, dengue, pathogenesis, the, process, by, which, the, disease, develops, in, humans, as, well, as, the, biology, ecology, and, behaviour, of, the, mosquito, vector, improved, diagnostics, would, enable, faster, and, more, appropriate, treatment, attempts, are, ongoing, to, develop, an, antiviral, medicine, targeting, the, ns3, or, ns5, proteins, in, addition, to, the, two, vaccines, which, are, already, available, several, vaccine, candidates, are, in, development, outbreaks, of, dengue, fever, increase, the, need, for, blood, products, while, decreasing, the, number, of, potential, blood, donors, due, to, potential, infection, with, the, virus, someone, who, has, a, dengue, infection, is, typically, not, allowed, to, donate, blood, for, at, least, the, next, six, months, international, anti, dengue, day, is, observed, every, year, on, 15, june, in, a, number, of, countries, the, idea, was, first, agreed, upon, in, 2010, with, the, first, event, held, in, jakarta, indonesia, in, 2011, further, events, were, held, in, 2012, in, yangon, myanmar, and, in, 2013, in, vietnam, goals, are, to, increase, public, awareness, about, dengue, mobilize, resources, for, its, prevention, and, control, and, to, demonstrate, the, southeast, asian, region, s, commitment, in, tackling, the, disease, efforts, are, ongoing, as, of, 2019, to, make, it, a, global, event, the, philippines, has, an, awareness, month, in, june, since, 1998, a, national, dengue, day, is, held, in, india, annually, on, 16, may, a, study, estimate, that, the, global, burden, of, dengue, in, 2013, amounted, to, us, 8, 9, billion
