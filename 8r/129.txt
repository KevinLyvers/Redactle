a, joint, or, articulation, or, articular, surface, is, the, connection, made, between, bones, ossicles, or, other, hard, structures, in, the, body, which, link, an, animal, s, skeletal, system, into, a, functional, whole, they, are, constructed, to, allow, for, different, degrees, and, types, of, movement, some, joints, such, as, the, knee, elbow, and, shoulder, are, self, lubricating, almost, frictionless, and, are, able, to, withstand, compression, and, maintain, heavy, loads, while, still, executing, smooth, and, precise, movements, other, joints, such, as, sutures, between, the, bones, of, the, skull, permit, very, little, movement, only, during, birth, in, order, to, protect, the, brain, and, the, sense, organs, the, connection, between, a, tooth, and, the, jawbone, is, also, called, a, joint, and, is, described, as, a, fibrous, joint, known, as, a, gomphosis, joints, are, classified, both, structurally, and, functionally, the, number, of, joints, depends, on, if, sesamoids, are, included, age, of, the, human, and, the, definition, of, joints, however, the, number, of, sesamoids, is, the, same, in, most, people, with, variations, being, rare, joints, are, mainly, classified, structurally, and, functionally, structural, classification, is, determined, by, how, the, bones, connect, to, each, other, while, functional, classification, is, determined, by, the, degree, of, movement, between, the, articulating, bones, in, practice, there, is, significant, overlap, between, the, two, types, of, classifications, structural, classification, names, and, divides, joints, according, to, the, type, of, binding, tissue, that, connects, the, bones, to, each, other, there, are, four, structural, classifications, of, joints, joints, can, also, be, classified, functionally, according, to, the, type, and, degree, of, movement, they, allow, joint, movements, are, described, with, reference, to, the, basic, anatomical, planes, joints, can, also, be, classified, according, to, the, number, of, axes, of, movement, they, allow, into, nonaxial, gliding, as, between, the, proximal, ends, of, the, ulna, and, radius, monoaxial, uniaxial, biaxial, and, multiaxial, another, classification, is, according, to, the, degrees, of, freedom, allowed, and, distinguished, between, joints, with, one, two, or, three, degrees, of, freedom, a, further, classification, is, according, to, the, number, and, shapes, of, the, articular, surfaces, flat, concave, and, convex, surfaces, types, of, articular, surfaces, include, trochlear, surfaces, joints, can, also, be, classified, based, on, their, anatomy, or, on, their, biomechanical, properties, according, to, the, anatomic, classification, joints, are, subdivided, into, simple, and, compound, depending, on, the, number, of, bones, involved, and, into, complex, and, combination, joints, the, joints, may, be, classified, anatomically, into, the, following, groups, unmyelinated, nerve, fibers, are, abundant, in, joint, capsules, and, ligaments, as, well, as, in, the, outer, part, of, intra, articular, menisci, these, nerve, fibers, are, responsible, for, pain, perception, when, a, joint, is, strained, damaging, the, cartilage, of, joints, articular, cartilage, or, the, bones, and, muscles, that, stabilize, the, joints, can, lead, to, joint, dislocations, and, osteoarthritis, swimming, is, a, great, way, to, exercise, the, joints, with, minimal, damage, a, joint, disorder, is, termed, arthropathy, and, when, involving, inflammation, of, one, or, more, joints, the, disorder, is, called, arthritis, most, joint, disorders, involve, arthritis, but, joint, damage, by, external, physical, trauma, is, typically, not, termed, arthritis, arthropathies, are, called, polyarticular, multiarticular, when, involving, many, joints, and, monoarticular, when, involving, only, a, single, joint, arthritis, is, the, leading, cause, of, disability, in, people, over, the, age, of, 55, there, are, many, different, forms, of, arthritis, each, of, which, has, a, different, cause, the, most, common, form, of, arthritis, osteoarthritis, also, known, as, degenerative, joint, disease, occurs, following, trauma, to, the, joint, following, an, infection, of, the, joint, or, simply, as, a, result, of, aging, and, the, deterioration, of, articular, cartilage, furthermore, there, is, emerging, evidence, that, abnormal, anatomy, may, contribute, to, early, development, of, osteoarthritis, other, forms, of, arthritis, are, rheumatoid, arthritis, and, psoriatic, arthritis, which, are, autoimmune, diseases, in, which, the, body, is, attacking, itself, septic, arthritis, is, caused, by, joint, infection, gouty, arthritis, is, caused, by, deposition, of, uric, acid, crystals, in, the, joint, that, results, in, subsequent, inflammation, additionally, there, is, a, less, common, form, of, gout, that, is, caused, by, the, formation, of, rhomboidal, shaped, crystals, of, calcium, pyrophosphate, this, form, of, gout, is, known, as, pseudogout, temporomandibular, joint, syndrome, tmj, involves, the, jaw, joints, and, can, cause, facial, pain, clicking, sounds, in, the, jaw, or, limitation, of, jaw, movement, to, name, a, few, symptoms, it, is, caused, by, psychological, tension, and, misalignment, of, the, jaw, malocclusion, and, may, be, affecting, as, many, as, 75, million, americans, the, english, word, joint, is, a, past, participle, of, the, verb, join, and, can, be, read, as, joined, joint, is, derived, from, latin, iunctus, past, participle, of, the, latin, verb, iungere, join, unite, connect, attach, the, english, term, articulation, is, derived, from, latin, articulatio, humans, have, also, developed, lighter, more, fragile, joint, bones, over, time, due, to, the, decrease, in, physical, activity, compared, to, thousands, of, years, ago
